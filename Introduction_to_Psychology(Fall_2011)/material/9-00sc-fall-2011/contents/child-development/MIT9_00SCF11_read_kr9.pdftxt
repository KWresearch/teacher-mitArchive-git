IN THE BEGINNING: FROM CONCEPTION TO BIRTH 
Prenatal Development: Nature (genes) and Nurture (environment) 
2 gametes (sperm + egg) join  zygote  (has 23  PAIRS  of chromosomes) 
 Review basic info on DNA, chromosomes, etc. from 7.01x 
Maturation: the  developmenta l process that produces genetica lly programmed changes in the body,
brain or behavior w ith increasing age
Female = XX; Male = XY 
The Y chromosome contains a gene that produces a chemica l substance causing the zygote to 
•	
develop into a ma le. If this substance is not present, genes on the X chromosome will produce
other substances that cause the zygote to be fema le.
Each zygote consists of a unique combination of genes. 
3 Trimesters: 
1st Trimester: 3 stages – zygote  embryo  (developing baby from the point where the major
•	
axis of the body is present unt il a ll major structures are present, ~ 2 wks – 8  wks after 
conception)  fetus (developing baby during the fina l phase of development in the womb, ~ 8
wks after conception until birth) 
2nd Trimester end: Most of the neurons of the  nervous system  are in place. 
•	
Learning and Behavior in the Womb
Fetuses are active nearly from the start , at first with automatic movements like heart beating, and then
with large -sca le coordinated behaviors. 
As the fetus develops, the heart rate slows down (but becomes more variable), the fetus moves less
often but more vigorously when it does stir , and the heart rate and movement patterns become
coordinated. 
•  Male fetuses more act ive than females 
20 – 25 wks = sensitivity to sound and light (when examined with fetoscope , fetus moves hands to 
shie ld eyes)
28 wks = response to externa l st imulation
25 – 34 wks = detection of human speech
33 wks = pay attention to music
Fetuses can learn. 
•	 Pregnant women read The Cat  in the Hat aloud 2x / day / 6 wks  after birth, babies tested 
recognize mother’s voice (sucking pacifier at same speed as mother’s vo ice), prefer to read The 
Cat in the Hat over  another  story
Characteristics of the fetus’ behavior predict those of the child after b irth 
Fetuses that had more variable heart rates later developed into more linguistica lly able

•	
toddlers; demonstrated more sophisticated forms of play

•	 The genes and environmental events (ex: diet) tha t influence behavior in the womb continue to 
influence behavior after birth. 
Teratogens: any externa l agent , such as a chemica l, virus, or type of radiation that can cause damage
to the zygote , embryo, or fetus 
•  Different organs are vulnerable to teratogens at different periods of development.
Maternal Illness  affects central nervous system / brain development 
•	 Chicken pox / rube lla  mental retardation if baby was an embryo  at onset  of disease 
•	 HIV+  babies can contract HIV… bra in damage in fetuses, problems in concentration,
attention, memory, movement contro l, ability to reason 
Alchohol and Drugs 
Fetal alcoho l syndrome  impa ired mental functioning, problems with aspects of reasoning
•	
that involve working memory

•	 Hero in / cocaine  physical defects, irritability, difficulties sleeping, attentional problems,
long-last ing consequences 
•	 Cocaine can also affect sperm , which subsequently transport the drug into the egg and impair
growth / development
Caffeine amd Smoking 
•	 Excessive amounts of caffe ine (3 cups of coffee / day)  miscarriage, low birth weight ,

irritability

Smoking  affects fetus’  lungs, miscarriage, low birth weight , smaller head size, stillbirth, 
infant mortality, attentional difficult ies, damage fetus’s genes, increases chances that baby will
die  from sudden infant death syndrome  (SIDS) by altering the way the infant’s autonomic 
nervous system operates
Diet and Pollution 
•	 Poor diet  fewer brain ce lls than normal, increased risk of psycho logical disorders 
Insufficient folic acid  disrupts early development of central nervous system ; infant can be 
•	
born without the top of the skull; spina bifida (spine does not close properly); essentia l for
producing the iron-containing protein needed to form red blood cells 
Fish with high levels of methylmercury  infant  deafness, visual problems 
•	
•	 Pollutants / ionizing radiation  birth defects, cancer , behavioral difficulties, can be passed 
on to grandchildren
Maternal Stressors 
Infants may experience attent iona l difficulties, be unusually ansious, exhibit unusual socia l
•	
behavior 
Fetuses move less often, less vigorously, other physical differences 
•	
•	 Triggered by less blood flow to the uterus, production of cortiso l which slows down operation
of genes that guide prenatal development of the brain (suppressing brain growth) 
•	 Babies born to stressed mothers tend to have sma ller heads 
Positive Environmental Events 
•	 Eating choco late  babies have  more  positive  temperaments 
•	 Playing music  more advanced infants – better motor control, better voca l abilit ies 
The human bra in is not fully deve loped at birth; much human brain development cont inues after
birth. Nevertheless, a baby is not a blank slate ; they come equipped w ith a surprising range of
abilit ies and capacities
Babies have the beginnings of sophist icated sensory capabilities; sensit ive to range of frequencies of 
women’s voices; sensitive sense of smell 
Infants also come equipped w ith a w ide range of reflexes (inborn, automatic response  to a  stimulus,
actions that do not require thought . Many disappear as the baby develops 
Sucking in response to a touch on the lips 
•	
•	 Moro reflex – startled baby throws its arms w ide as if to grab ho ld of someone 
•	 Babinski reflex – baby’s big toe  flexes while  the  other toes fan out when the sole  of his/her  foot 
is stroked 
Temperament: even immediately a fter birth, babies demonstrate  differences  in  temperament  
(inclination to engage in a certain style of behavior) 
•	 Approach (react positively to new stimuli) v. withdrawal (react negative to new stimuli, i.e .:
cry, fuss, etc.) 
•	 Easy (don’t cry as often, not as demanding) v. difficult  (fussy, demanding) 
Some aspects of temperament tend to remain stable over the course of deve lopment , as a

o	 Ex: handling rat pups during the first 10 days after birth  animals later are not as 
nervous when put  in a  large fie ld, do not react as strongly to stress, less prone to 
learned helplessness 
o	 Gently touching infants not only can enhance their growth and deve lopment , but a lso
can reduce the EEG activation in the frontal lobe that is associated with depression and 
can boost  immune funct ion. 

INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD 
Physical and Motor Development
Contro l progresses from the head down the trunk  to the arms, and finally to the legs. At the same

time, control extends out from the center of the body to the periphery (hands, fingers, toes). By age 2 ,

the child has good control over all the limbs.

Fine motor control (ex: playing the piano) develops more slowly; better in some people than in others

Infants have sophisticated bra in systems that control movement / plan movements in tandem .

•	 At an early age, infants can plan their movements based on the requirements of a task. 
o  Ex: reaching for a ball > dropping ball down a tube 
Early theories  the  consistent  and universal order of motor development  implies that such 
development is entire ly maturational (i.e .: entirely a result of genetic programs that unfold over time). 
•	 This is WRONG… also involves specific opportunities to learn about the body, world 
Typical Ages for Developmental Motor Milestones:
2 – 5 mos: fo llow  movements with eyes; life head and chest while on stomach; ho ld head steady; ho ld
an object placed on hand 
6 -9 mos: roll over; sit upright; pick up sma ll objects with thumb and fingers; shift objects between
hands; crawl 
10 – 12 mos: pull to upright  standing; ‘cruise’ (walk by supporting body against  objects); turn pages of 
book 
13 – 18 mos: scribble; walk unaided; feed self; point to pictures when asked; throw a  ball while
keeping balance 
Perceptual and Cognitive Development
Concepts come from:
1.	 Perception: the organization and identification of information rece ived through the  senses 
2.	 Reflect ion and reasoning (change  with cognitive  and memory development) 
3.	 Social environment 
Infant Visual Perception
Infants view the world blurrily. With age, visual acuity increases from developments in the eye 
Visua l cliff experiment – sheet of glass extends over part of floor that has been stepped down… 
infants will not crawl out over glass  Depth perception is acquired before  infants can talk 
Even at 2 months, babies can tell the difference between 2 depths (slower heart rate = paying more 
attention)
Other techniques for examining infant visua l perception = amount of time they spend looking at
stimuli (habituation technique , aka  looking time technique) 
If a baby looks at a particular shape long enough, s/he will no longer find it interesting, and
•	
thus w ill prefer to look at something new… what babies perceive as “different” 
•	 By varying how 2 st imuli differ (in shape, distance , co lor, etc.) and noting the circumstances  in  
which babies prefer a new stimulus after habituating to a previous one , it is possible to
discover what difference they can detect. 
•	 Looking t ime can be used to assess what an infant notices, even without habituation.

o	
Infants (2-5  days)  prefer  direct eye contact 
o	 Newborns only notice isolated portions of objects 
o	
2-3 mos: perce ive overall shapes; organize line fragments into 3D forms 
o	
6 mos: can see a set of objects as forming a group, mentally fill in when the ir view of a 
moving object is briefly obstructed.  
•	 As they grow o lder, babies need less st imulus information to recognize patterns… can use
know ledge about objects to infer a whole from a part?? 
Infant Auditory Perception 
•	 Compared with visual perception, auditory perception appears to be more fully deve loped at 
an earlier age 
Infants are  innately tuned to find consonance more pleasing than dissonance 
•	
•	 Humans must learn to appreciate the sound of dissonant music, but such learning either is not
required to appreciate consonant music or takes place very early in life. 
Perceptual development continues beyond the first year of life 
•	 Toddlers (2-3 yrs.): when shown an array of objects and asked whether it includes a specific
object, they look haphazardly from place to place 
6-9 yrs: search array systematica lly, left to right , top to bottom (like they are reading) 
•	
11 yrs: children have perceptual abilities similar to (but slower than) adults 
•	
Language Development 
How  is Language Acquired? (3 different perspect ives) 
1.	 Behaviorist theories: (B.F. Skinner) language is ent irely the result of learning. Children acquire
words and combinations of words through imitation / re inforcement . 
a.	 Not many people agree w ith this view anymore. 
2.	 Nativist theories: (Noam  Chomsky) crucia l aspects of language  are innate, not learned 
a.	 Nativism: the view that people are born w ith some language 
b.	 Language acquisition device: an innate mechanism, hypothesized by Chomsky, that
contains the grammatical rules common to all languages and a llows language
acquisition 
Interactionist theories: call on both learning and innate knowledge  to explain how  language  is
acquired. Language acquisition relies on social events (ex: interact ions between caregiver and
child), draws on relatively general cognitive abilities (ex: motor control, percept ion).  
The fact that virtually a ll normally developing humans come to speak a language , even without

formal instruction, is evidence that there is something special about the way our brains are

constructed that allows us to acquire and use language.

Language ability develops in an orderly progression.

Child-directed speech: speech by caregivers to babies that relies on short  sentences with clear pauses, 

careful enunciation, exaggerated intonation, and a high-pitched voice. 
Infants are surprisingly sophisticated in their ability to draw distinctions among spoken sounds. 
Babies have no trouble distinguishing between phonemes. 
•	
•	 After 6 mos: infants start to ignore distract ions among sound that are not used in the language
spoken around them . 
o	 By ignoring unused distinct ions, infants focus in on just the sounds in the surrounding
language , a llows them to acquire words in that language . 
8 mos: infants can use patterns of sound regularity to ident ify individual words even when the
•	
actual sounds run together into a single continuous stream
Infants can discriminate and organize sounds much better than they can produce them .
Similar principles apply to deaf children and sign language .

The number of words children learn changes as they get older . 
1 yr: most children say their first words 
•	
2 yrs: learning words! 
•	
3 yrs: learn meanings of words / facts about objects after hearing them only a single time 
•	
6 yrs: 10 ,000 words
• 
Rate of learning is affected by various factors. (Ex: hormones, sex ro les) 
Toddlers can understand far more words than they can say. 
18 mos: say 50 words 
vs. 
13 mos: understand 50 words 
•	
Culture affects which words are learned initia lly. 
English: more nouns than verbs 
vs.  Mandarin: more verbs than nouns 
•	
•	 Vietnam : children learn respectful pronouns used to refer to elders before learning the words 
for many objects 
Children do not learn the entire meaning of the word all at once. Init ially grasp only a core aspect of
what the word means. 
Overextension: overly broad use of a word to refer to a new  object or situation 
Ex: dog = anything with 4 legs
Over the course of addit iona l learning, they discover which features restrict the appropriate use of the
word. 
Underextension: an overly narrow use  of a  word to refer to  a new object or  situation
Ex: using animal for dogs
As children hear the word used in different contexts, they broaden the underlying concept , which
eventually eliminates underextensions. 
Grammar : the set of rules that determines how words can be organized into an infinite number  of  
acceptable sentences in a language 
o	 Syntax : internal organization of a  sentence that is determined by a set of rules for  combining
different parts of speech 
o	 Semantics : the meaning of words and sentences 
o  Pragmatics: indirect  / implied meanings 
2 yrs: children start putting words together into the simplest sentences
Telegraphic speech: packs a  lot  of information into a few  highly informative words, typically
omitting words such as the , a, and  of 
3 yrs: children who speak English start using sentences that follow the sequence of subject-verb-object
4 yrs: master grammar rules, generalize from them (even w ith nonsense words) ex: one wug, two ___ 
•	 Why? Most verbs in a language are regular , fo llow ing an easily derived rule for  changes in 
tense 
o	 Ex: play  played 
o	 Overregularization error : a mistake that occurs in speech when the  child applies a
newly learned rule even to cases where  it does not apply 
 Ex: runned instead of ran 
 See p. 332 , Figure 5 for Major Milestones in Language Acquisition
Theories to explain regularities in these milestones: 
Language progresses because other cognit ive abilities (ex: working memory) increase as the
•	
brain matures 
Language has an internal “ logic” and children must learn certain aspects of a language before
•	
they can learn other aspects that make use of them

•	 Adopted children went through steps of acquiring new language faster than younger children,
which probably does  reflect  their  increased  cognit ive  abilities,  but  the  important  point  is  that
they still went through the same steps.
Some children never progress through these milestones at all... ex: children who grow up in the wild
Critical period: narrow  window of time when a  certain type  of learning or some aspect  of 
development is possible 
•	 Children who are not exposed to language before puberty never grasp the rules of grammar
fully. 
Long-Term Memory Development 
Infant Explicit Memory
Even 3 month old infants can store  information explicitly 
•	 Ex: Foot –  Ribbon – Mobile  experiment  babies kick faster  only when they see mobiles where
the plus marks are the initia l size. They recalled the origina l mobile explicitly. 
Infant Implicit Memory
Tested with same  ribbon-kicking experiment; wait ing period between initia l mobile and new mobile
now 2 wks (explicit memories only last 6-8 days for infants)  babies kick faster  when they see plus
signs of all sizes, not  just for the ones the same as the initial size 
Verba l Memories 
Simcock & Hayne: asked young children to learn to operate a machine that shrank the sizes of toys 
1 yr. later – children still recall various aspects of “incredible  shrinking toy,”  but only used
•	
words that they knew at the time when they initia lly experienced it 
•	 Language-based memory  infant verbal memories are frozen in time… use words that they
knew at time of memory to encode the event , not words that they know at the time of recall 
PIAGET’S THEORY 
Cognitive development –  the  gradual transition from infant to adult menta l capacity 
Babies begin with very simple , innate schemas (mental structures that organize sensory and
perceptual input and connect it to the appropriate responses)
Assimilation: allows the infant to use existing schemas to organize and interpret new stimuli and 
respond appropriately
Accommodation: schemas’ changing / creation of new schemas as necessary to cope with a broader
range of situations 
 Together, assimilation and accommodation are the engine  that powers cognitive deve lopment .
A child’s thinking changes systematically over time as new schemas develop. 
4 Major Periods :
1.	 SENSORIMOTOR PERIOD (0-2 yrs) 
the child acts on the world as perce ived and is not capable of thinking about 
–	
objects in the ir absence; no object permanence (the understanding that
objects inc. people cont inue to exist even when they cannot be immediately
perceived) [i.e.: out of sight, out of mind, out of existence]; ability to imitate
gained at 9 mos. 
2.	 PREOPERATIONAL PERIOD (2-7 yrs) 
–	 words, images, and act ions are used to represent informat ion mentally;
language and symbolic play develop [ex: bar of soap is a submerged
submarine]; but thought is tied to perce ived events; able to think about
objects / events that are not immediately present ; do not yet have a “logic”

for manipulating / “operating” on mental representations; do not understand
conservation (properties like mass remain the  same even when the
appearance of the material / object changes, provided that nothing is added 
or removed)  [i.e.:  children  in  this  period  believe  that  a  pizza  cut  into  12  pieces
has more then the same pizza cut  into 8 pieces] 
Egocentrism: inability to take another’s po int of view 
•	 Characteristic of both sensorimotor and preoprational children 
3.	 CONCRETE OPERATIONS PERIOD (7-11 yrs) 
–	 Reasoning is based on a logic that is t ied to what can be perceived; capable of
concrete operations (reversible manipulation of the menta l representation of
an object that corresponds to an actual physical manipulat ion); organizing
information systematica lly into categories; able to use mental tools to classify
objects and their properties; better able to reason logically; can reverse menta l
manipulations; able to take another person’s perceptive 
4.	 FORMAL OPERATIONS (11 yrs) 
–	 Reasoning  is  based  on  a  logic  that  includes  abstractions,  which  leads  to
systematic thinking about hypothetical events; capable of formal  operations
(reversible mental acts that can be performed even with abstract concepts) ;
can understand “what is” /  “what could be”  / “what would happen if” ; can
weigh different benefits / drawbacks of a situation 

BEYOND PIAGET 
Piaget’s theory is tied to specific testing methods –  tasks assess only easily observable  aspects of

behavior .

When more subtle measurements are taken, it becomes evident that a lthough the  ordering of the

milestones is as Piaget cla imed, children can show competence we ll before the ages Piaget reported.

Meltzoff et al. – infants have capacit ies beyond those claimed by Piaget

2-3 wks: show imitat ion  (ex:  happy  /  sad  facial  expressions)  
•	
9 mos: can add and subtract 
•	
3 mos: object permanence 
•	
3 yrs: can understand some aspects of the principles involved in conservation of amount, mass 
•	
Piaget’s theory somet imes underestimates the sophist ication of young children’s conceptions of the
world. Infants demonstrate an understanding of some aspects of physica l laws even before they have
developed the kinds of perceptual-motor schemas that Piaget claimed are the foundations of such 
know ledge . 
4 mos: awareness of time intervals, show surprise when a predictable sequence of flashing
•	
lights is interrupted 
Even young infants rea lize that objects need to be physically supported or they w ill tumble
down; objects can’t move  through other objects, objects don’t flit from place to place but shift 
along connected paths. 
Challenges to Piaget: 
•	 Children do not master all abilities that should require the same logical operations at the same 
age. 
o	 Ex: conservation of number before conservation of liquid, but conservation is 
conservation?? 
Some children don’t enter period of formal operations until high schoo l (if at all??)

Growing Wiser 
Take-home messages from Piaget: children’s performance does change qualitatively in some types of tasks as 
they age. Piaget discovered many counterintuitive phenomena, like conservation and egocentrism, that all
subsequent theories of cognitive development must be able to explain as well. 
Information Processing and Neural Development 
Information processing approach = perception and cognit ion rely on a host of distinct processes in the
brain, and these capacities develop as the re levant parts of the brain deve lop
Younger children perform poorly because their working memory is not as deve loped. 
•	 Remember: working memory increases with age throughout childhood. As working memory
capacity increases, a child becomes able to perform tasks that were previously beyond reach. 
•	 Explains many of the phenomena documented by Piaget [ex: out of sight / out of mind / lack
of object permanence]
Quant itative change in capacity (increase in working memory size)  Qualitat ive change in 
performance (transit ion to a new stage) 
The rapid growth spurts the bra in undergoes around the ages that Piaget identified as marking
transitions to new periods account for a child’s improvements in working memory with age
Some of the increase in brain we ight w ith age may be due to myelinization, which increases the speed
and efficiency of neural transmission; some due to the larger numbers of synapses and long-distance 
connections 
These  changes increase  the  speed of information processing; allow  more  information to be activated
at the same time , which in turn would increase working memory capacity 
VYGOTSKY’S SOCIOCULTURAL THEORY: OUTSIDE / INSIDE
Emphasize  the role of socia l interact ion  during  development
Child constructs representations of the world by first learning rules, customs of his/her culture,
which as represented in the child’s mind, then serve to guide behavior
Adults promote cognitive development by guiding and explicit ly  instructing  children  about  world,  
culture 
Language plays a crucial role  in this process – conveys specific instruction, culture 
•	 Language  is part ly a cultural creation  capacity for language  is innate , but the particular 
language spoken is created by a culture 
•  Thus, culture influences both the content and form of the child’s thinking.
Culture affects the brain, and vice versa 
•	 Culture determines which language(s) you learn, which in turn affects how your brain

processes sounds.

•	 The brain affects culture [ex: we don’t have customs that require more working memory
capacity than the bra in provides] 
SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
Attachment = an emot iona l bond that leads a person to want to be w ith someone else and to miss
him/her when separated
Origins 
“Cupboard theory” = infants become attached because their caregivers feed them 
•	
•	 Harlow et al. = Impulse to seek comfort  (baby monkeys with fuzzy “mother” vs. robot

“mother” that fed them)

•  Bow lby = children go  through phases during the development of attachment 
Separation anxiety = fear of being away from the primary caregiver (arises from object permanence ; 
infants can now think and remember objects inc. primary caregiver for re latively long periods of t ime
even when the objects are no longer present)

Types of Attachment 
Secure  = babies are upset when mother  leaves, not comforted by stranger , calm down quickly
•	
when mother returns (60-70% of American babies) 
•	 Avoidant = babies don’t’ seem to  care very much whether mother  is present / absent ; equa lly
comfortable w ith her and stranger; when mother returns, do not immediately gravitate to her
(15-20% of American babies) 
•	 Resistant = babies do not use  mother as a base of operations for explorations, but stay close to
her, become angry when she  leaves; may hit mother when she returns, do not calm down 
easily afterwards (10 -15% of American babies) 
•	 Disorganized / Disoriented = babies become depressed and have periods of unresponsiveness
along with spurts of sudden emot ion (5-10% of American babies) 
Differences in attachment style are often a matter of degree (i.e.: there are intermediate types)
Influenced by a wide variety of factors: drug use (disorganized / disoriented)
Mothers who are more sensit ive to babies’ moods and behaviors had more securely attached infants 
Children of mothers who are economically disadvantages are less secure ly attached. 
Type of early attachment has long-lasting effects:
Infants with secure attachments who were  later studied were found to have closer friendships and
better social skills than children who had not been securely attached as infants
Type of attachment determines how some genes operate  certain genes that underlie aggression and
excessive drinking of alcohol are only act ivated with insecure early attachment
Secure attachment can lead a child to be more confident with exploring  better  learning  more 
intimate love relationships 
Self-Concept = be liefs, desires, values, and attributes that  define a person to him/herself
For young children, the self-concept is necessarily grounded in the level of cognit ive development 
•  Preschoo lers think of themselves in very concrete terms (ex: behaviors, physica l appearance)
At what age do children begin to conce ive of themselves as having specific characteristics? 
3 month olds prefer to look at the face of another child of the same age rather than at the ir own 
•	
face  they are already familiar with the appearance of their  face
Also relies on concept ion of person’s own psychological characteristics: 
3 yrs: children begin to appreciate that they have distinct psychologica l characteristics (ex:
•	
being happy in certain situat ions, not in others) 
•  8 – 11 yrs: children begin to describe themselves in terms of personality tra its
Complete self-concept is not possible until the child has the ability to characterize how his/her
psycho logical characteristics affect his/her relationships with other people… vice versa . 
 need formal operat ions (a la Piaget) for this… ~ age 11? 
Gender Roles = culturally determined appropriate behaviors for males versus fema les 
Vary in different cultures, social classes, t ime periods
A child’s understanding of gender roles develops early. 
•	 By age 2, children have apparently learned about  gender role differences 
•	 Preschoo l boys believe that if they play w ith cross-gender toys, the ir father will think that was 
“bad” 
Children develop gender roles w ith experience .
Freud  children identify w ith the same-sex parent. This is the main way in which gender roles 
develop
Maccoby  identification w ith the  same-sex parent is the result of gender role development 
•	 Gender segregat ion  arises from biologica l / hormonal differences; personality differences…
boys too aggressive / too difficult to influence

MORAL DEVELOPMENT = ability to tell right from wrong 
KOHLBERG’S THEORY 
Presented boys and men with moral dilemmas (situations in which there are moral pros and cons for
each of a set of possible actions) [ex: man who breaks into a store for expensive drugs for his dying
wife]
3 levels of moral development (based on reasons for decisions, not what the decisions are): 
1.	 Preconventional level = focuses on ro le of authority figure to define what correct  actions are;
good behaviors are rewarded and bad ones are punished. [If he lets his wife die, he will get in
trouble] 
2.	 Conventional level = focuses on ro le of rules that  maintain socia l order , allow people to  get
along (ex: Golden Rule). Morality is closely t ied to individual re lationships. [If he lets his wife
die , people would think he was some kind of heartless lizard] 
3.	 Postconventional level (aka principled level) = focuses on development of abstract principles
that govern the decision to accept or reject specific rules. Principles are adopted that are
believed to apply to everyone . [Human life is the highest principle ; everything else must be 
secondary. People have a duty to help one another to live] 
Criticisms of Kohlberg’s Theory:
Questionable generality of levels  doesn’t apply to girls vs. women 
•	 Gilligan: females tend to  focus on an ethic of care (concern and responsibility for the well-be ing
of others); Kohlberg’s higher levels of moral development focus on abstract rights and justice 
(male-oriented perspect ive?) 
•	 Although there is evidence that males and females do emphasize different principles in their 
moral reasoning, this difference seems to be more a reflect ion of their daily activit ies.
Different types of mora l reasoning aren’t traits which characterize a person in most situat ions…
rather, people use different types of moral reasoning depending on the  details  of  the  dilemma .  
Making decisions about moral dilemmas may be governed by various aspects of a person’s character
(i.e.: conscience , empathy) as well. 
Many factors a ffect how people think and behave in moral situations, some of these factors develop

much earlier than does the ability to reason logically about morality.

Our behavior is a result both of how we reason and of who we are .


ADOLESCENCE = the period between the onset of puberty and, roughly, the end of the teenage 
years 
Begins with puberty (the time when hormones cause the sex organs to mature  and secondary sexua l
characteristics, such as breasts for women and a bread for men, to appear) 
Various factors influence when puberty occurs (typically 12-13 years): 
•	 Nutrition – overweight girls enter puberty earlier 
Stress 
•	
•	 Additives in food (ex: hormones in animal feed passed on to human consumers) 
•  Chemical po llutants (ex: PBBs)
In recent years, the age of puberty has declined –  for both girls and boys – throughout  the developed 
and developing world. 
Boys and girls have growth spurts at different ages.

Growing Wiser 
Cognitive Development  major development  in ado lescents = ability to  reason abstractly 
•	 All of the cognit ive machinery necessary to think scient ifically / systematica lly about
abstractions can be present by about 11 – 12  yrs, but not all adolescents deve lop these abilities 
this early, some never do
Frontal / parietal lobes used by adolescents / adults when they first learned rules of algebra , used
those rules to so lve equations – but  after practice  in adolescents, parietal lobes no  longer activated…
rules became “automatic” (does not happen in adults) 
Cole: in many tradit iona l African societies, even the adults cannot use the kinds of abilities described
by Piaget’s idea of forma l operations, but there is no indication that their brains have failed to 
develop fully.
Vygotsky is right – learning must play a role when culture shapes the developing child’s thought 
Lower middle part of the frontal lobes cont inues to deve lop well into adulthood,  so  emotions  may  not
guide teenagers’ thinking effect ive ly… maturational lag contributes to lack of “good judgment”
during adolescence. 
Adolescent Egocentrism
Enhanced cognitive abilities in adolescents can lead to 2 kinds of distortions in ado lescents’ 
conceptions of how others view them : 
Imaginary audience : they are actors, everyone else  is the  audience; extreme se lf-consciousness, 
•	
easily embarrassed, (realistic?) concerns about others’ opinions 
•	 Personal fable: story in which they are the star, and as the star , have extraordinary abilities,
privileges (teenagers are immune to possible consequences) 
Social and Emotional Development
“Storm and Stress”: Raging Hormones
There is a tendency for norma l adolescents to have 3 sets of problems due to the hormonal changes 
that go along with puberty:
1.	 Adolescents tend to have conflicts with their parents. The frequency of the conflicts is greatest
in early adolescence, the intensity of the conflicts is greatest in midado lescence 
2.	 Adolescents tend to  experience extreme mood sw ings, and by the  middle of the teen years,
about 1/3 of adolescents are seriously depressed –  and such depression is associated with
increased leve ls of delinquency. Adolescents a lso often report feeling lonely and nervous 
3.	 Adolescents may be prone to taking risks 
Not all ado lescents have  these problems – they’re  just more  likely to occur during adolescence than a t
other ages. Hormones only predispose you to emotional sw ings, environmental events trigger the
emotiona l react ions. The degree to which an adolescent does experience such turmo il depends on
personal and cultura l circumstances. 
Evolving Peer Relationships
Many adolescents develop predominantly same-gender networks of friends. Women’s friendships 
tend to be stronger than  men’s.  Negative  re lationships  are  just  as  powerful  as  positive  ones.  
 (Think Mean Girls)

Although many aspects of ado lescents’ behaviors are influenced in large part by their peers, an

adolescent’s basic values and goals are influence primarily by his/her family.

Teenage pregnancy
Teenagers most like ly to become pregnant typically are poor , don’t have clear career paths, father is
absent .

Children of teen mothers are like ly to drop out of schoo l, be unemployed, be in trouble with the law
for violent offences, tend to  become teenage parents as well. 
The specific consequences of a teen mother’s having a child depends on the mother’s subsequent
behavior and social group. Black Americans appear to suffer fewest negative economic consequences
of having given birth as a teenager. 

ADULTHOOD AND AGING 
The Changing Body
Height, weight relatively constant now
AGING! (50+) 
•	 Changes that are programmed into the genes 
•	 Changes that arise from environmental events (lack of adequate nutrition, exercise ,
meaningful act ivities)  some of these can be countered / diminished 
Women –  menopause  zest! || Men – declined vigor 
Perception
Changes in the sensory organs (eyes, ears) and the brain can markedly impair percept ion in o lder
adults. 
•	 Worsening vision  cataracts (clouding of the lenses of the eyes, pupil becomes sma ller,
decreased depth perception (causes old people  to stumble over steps) 
•	 Difficulty shifting attention rapidly  problems driving 
•	 Don’t classify identit ies of faces as well as younger people do (but can st ill classify facial 
expressions, nonverbal cues) 
•	 Difficulty hearing high-frequency sounds, shutting out background noise 
Memory
Parts of the brain that produce the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (crucia l for the proper funct ion of

the hippocampus, plays key role in explicit memory) become impaired with age.

Hippocampus (correlated with recall ability) is smaller in older adults.

Aging affects some aspects of memory more than others, many aspects of memory are relat ive ly intact

in o lder adults:

Semantic memory (memory for facts, words, meanings, other information that is not

•	
associated with a part icular t ime and place) remains relatively intact into very o ld age

Storing new episodic memories is often re latively effective. 
•	
•	 Good implicit memory, can  recall  the  gist  of  a  description  and  its  implications  at  least  as  we ll  
as younger people. 
•	 Difficulty when they must act ively reca ll specific episodic memories (i.e.: reca ll of specific
information) and on tasks invo lving working memory, strategizing, holding information in 
mind while doing something e lse at the same time . 
o	 These rely on the frontal lobes to dig out memory, and processes accomplished there
are not as efficient in the e lderly as they are in younger people. 
Cognition slower processing, more prone to making errors

Signs of decline in some abilities begin to appear by age 50 because of changes in the brain:

•  Less gray matter, impaired communication among neurons (disrupted neurotransmitter
functioning), breakdown of mye lin (impaired transmission of neural signals) 
Shortly before death, some people exhibit terminal decline (dramatic decline  in cognitive abilities) – 
usually for people who w ill die from cerebrovascular diseases. But most people show a gradual
degradat ion in cognitive performance.

Changes in Fluid and Crystallized Intelligence
Assessed by longitudinal studies: the same group of people is tested repeatedly, at different ages 
•	 Both types of intelligence are stable until somewhere between the mid-50s and early 70s, when 
both decline 
•	 However , using the same group is both a strength and a  flaw, since participants become
familiar w ith the type of testing. 
Cross-sectional studies: different groups of people are tested, w ith each group comprised of
individuals of a particular age 
•  Ensure that the groups are equated on all possible measure other than age (i.e.: gender ,
educational level, health status)
Fluid intelligence begins to decline as early as the late 20s, whereas crystallized intelligence may 
actually grow with age and decline only  late  in  life  
Changes in Specific Abilities
Crystallized intelligence underlies “w isdom.”

In some respects, o ld people actually think more systematically (i.e .: consistent , logical).

SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT DURING ADULTHOOD 
THEORIES OF PSYCHOSOCIAL STAGES IN ADULTHOOD  Erik Erikson 
Psychosocial development: the result of maturation and learning on personality and relationships
5 stages through childhood / adolescence, 3 stages of adulthood 
1.	 Basic trust v . mistrust (0-1 yr) = depending on how well they are treated by caregivers, infants
either deve lop a basic trust that the world is good or fail to develop such a basic trust 
2.	 Autonomy v. doubt (1-3 yrs) = the child e ither is allowed to choose and make independent
decisions or  is made to  feel ashamed and full of se lf-doubt  for wanting to do so 
3.	
Initiative v. guilt (3-6 yrs) = the child e ither develops a sense of purpose and direction or is
overly contro lled by the parents and made to feel constrained or guilty 
Industry v . inferiority (6 -11) = the child either develops a  sense  of competence and ability to
4.	
work w ith others or becomes beset w ith feelings of incompetence and inferiority 
5.	
Identity v. role confusion (adolescence) = the  adolescent e ither  successfully grapples with 
questions of identity and future roles as an adult or becomes confused about possible adult 
roles 
6.	
Intimacy v. Isolation (young adulthood) = develop deep and intimate relat ions w ith others and
avoid becoming socially isolated 
7.	 Generativity v. self-absorption (middle adulthood) =  the adult  in the  “prime  of life”  must  look to
the future and determine what to leave behind for future generations; failing this task elads to
a sense of meaninglessness in life 
Integrity v. despair (old age) = in reflect ing back on life, a person e ither  feels  that  life  was  
worthwhile as it was lived or fee ls despa ir and fears death 
Extending Erikson’s Theory:
McAdams  assessing generativity… found that  adults who are concerned about providing for
future generations tend to be more satisfied w ith their  lives  and  to  view  life  optimistically,  believing
that even bad events will eventually have a happy outcome 
Continued Personality Development
Changes in perspective vs. changes in personality
Evidence indicates that personality does not change substantially during adulthood 
Cost & McCrae – there were very few differences in any of the dimensions of personality over the
years, and when such differences were found, they were very sma ll.

Growing Wiser 
Personality is equally stable over time for men and women.
Even when a person feels that his / her personality has changed during middle age , it really hasn’t
Although the structure of personality (i.e .: Big Five distribution) remains constant with increasing age
during adulthood, researchers found that o lder adults generally have higher scores on traits of
agreeableness and conscientiousness than do younger adults.
Apparent changes in personality over time probably reflect changes in the life cha llenges that s/he is
confronting at the time: changes in marital status, parenting, job-related factors 
With increasing age , your ranking relat ive to other people will become more stable , reflect ing your
settling into a niche in life , thus restricting the range and variety of situations you encounter 
Mature Emotions 
Older adults tend to experience extended periods of highly positive emotions and fewer spe lls of
enduring negat ive emot ions that do younger people.
“Mature” emotional responses: better regulation of emotions 
Adult Relationships: Stable Changes
Older people  tend to change the ir outlook on life (perhaps as a result of their increased ability to
grapple with emot ions?)
Socioemotional selectivity theory –  older  adults come  to focus on the  limited time they have  left, which  in
turn changes the ir motivations 
As people  age,  they  come  increasingly  to  value  emotiona lly  fulfilling  relationships.  This  leads  older
people to prefer the company of those with whom they are emotionally close
As people age, they interact with fewer people, but these interactions tend to be more intimate. 
The nature of relationships with both friends and relatives changes as people move into older
adulthood (i.e.: no longer concerned that relat ionships are equitable like younger adults). Older
adults trust that the balance of favors and repayment w ill event out over time. 
Older couples resolve  the ir differences with less negative emot ion than do younger couples.
