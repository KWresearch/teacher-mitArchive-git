***** Session Overview *****
                                        Do you remember your life as a young
                                        child? What capabilities to infants
                                        have? What are the stages of physical
                                        and cognitive development after birth?
                                        In this lecture, we will explore the
[A photo of a boy playing with blocks.] major milestones of infancy and the
                                        theories and phenomena that often
                                        accompany this progression.

1) According to Piaget's stages of cognitive development, the _______________
stage is when children acquire the ability to internally represent the world
through language and mental imagery. They also start to see the world from
other peopleâs perspectives.
   1. Formal operational
   2. Sensorimotor
   3. Preoperational
   4. Concrete operational
âº View/Hide Answer
C, preoperational. (Stangor, Table 6.3)
Â 
2) One of the most important behaviors a child must learn is how to be accepted
by othersâthe development of close and meaningful social relationships. The
emotional bonds that we develop with those with whom we feel closest, and
particularly the bonds that an infant develops with the mother or primary
caregiver, are referred to as attachment. Please describe the four types of
attachment and give an example of each.
âº Sample Answers
A child with a secure attachment style usually explores freely while the mother
is present and engages with the stranger. The child may be upset when the
mother departs but is also happy to see the mother return.
A child with an ambivalent (sometimes called insecure-resistant) attachment
style is wary about the situation in general, particularly the stranger, and
stays close or even clings to the mother rather than exploring the toys. When
the mother leaves, the child is extremely distressed and is ambivalent when she
returns. The child may rush to the mother but then fail to cling to her when
she picks up the child.
A child with an avoidant (sometimes called insecure-avoidant) attachment style
will avoid or ignore the mother, showing little emotion when the mother departs
or returns. The child may run away from the mother when she approaches. The
child will not explore very much, regardless of who is there, and the stranger
will not be treated much differently from the mother.
A child with a disorganized attachment style seems to have no consistent way of
coping with the stress of the strange situationâthe child may cry during the
separation but avoid the mother when she returns, or the child may approach the
mother but then freeze or fall to the floor. (Flatworld: p. 175)
