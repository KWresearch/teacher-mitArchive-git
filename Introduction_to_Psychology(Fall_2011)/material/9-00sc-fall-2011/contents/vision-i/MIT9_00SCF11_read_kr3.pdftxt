KOSSLYN CHAPTER 3 – Sensation and Perception: How the World Enters the Mind 

The processes of sensation and perception lie at the root of our experience of feeling alive , serving as
the foundation for most of what we know and do. 
Sensation –  the  result  of neural responses that occur after  physical energy stimulates a  receptor ce ll 
(such as those at the back of the eye , in the ear , on  the skin) but before the stimulus is
organized and interpreted by the brain
Once receptor cells are sufficient ly stimulated, tha t physical energy is transformed to neura l signals
that are sent to parts of the brain for: 
Perception – the result of neura l processes that  organize (such as by specifying a  particular shape) and
interpret (such as by identifying the object) information conveyed by sensory signals 
The process of sensation and perception allow  us  to  see,  hear ,  smell,  taste,  experience  touch,  and  
know where we are in space. 
VISION 
Phases of Vision 
Visua l sensations are  triggered when strong enough light waves cause specialized receptor cells at the
back of the eye to send neura l signals to the brain. These signa ls specify fundamental
characteristics of the stimulus (ex: color); most of the processes that underlie visua l sensation
occur in the eye and in subcortical structures of the brain, before the neural signals reach the 
cerebral cortex. Perceptual processing occurs in the cerebral cortex and organizes the neural
signals of sensation, deriving a particular shape, texture , and other features, and then
identifies the observed object and its position in space. 
2 phases of processing:
1.	 Organization into coherent units – to  get  sensations from surfaces and shapes, the brain must
organize patches of co lor, textures, edges, and other fundamental visual characteristics into
units… brain gets to specify sizes and locations of objects 
2.	
Identifying what and where 
Visual Sensation: More Than Meets the Eye 
Psychophysics: A World of Experience
Psychophysics –  founded by GT Fechner; studies the relation between physical events and the
corresponding experience of those events 
Thresholds: “Over the Top”
Stimuli cross a thresho ld when they activate receptor cells strongly enough to  be sensed 
Abso lute threshold –  the  magnitude  of the stimulus needed on average, for  an observer  to detect  it
half the time  it  is present 
Just-noticeable difference – the size  of the difference in a stimulus characteristic needed for a person
to detect a difference between two stimuli or a change in a single stimulus 
•	 Depends on the overall magnitude of the stimulus 
•	 Weber’s Law –  the  same percentage of a magnitude must be present in order to detect a 
difference between two stimuli or a change  in a single st imulus 
o	 Ex: greater magnitude of light = greater the extra amount must be in order to be
detected 
Detecting Signals: Noticing Needles in Haystacks
Signal detection theory –  theory of how people detect signals, which distinguishes between sensit ivity
and bias; the theory is based on the idea that signa ls are always embedded in noise , and thus
the challenge is to distinguish signa l from noise

•	

•	 Noise –  extraneous information that  interferes with detect ing a signa l 
o	
arises from : 
1.	 other stimuli in the environment 
2.	
random firings of neurons 
How signals are detected or missed: 
sensitivity –  corresponds to the amount of information required to detect  a signal, w ith greater 
•	
sensitivity indicating that less information is required (you have a lower thresho ld for
distinguishing between a stimulus (the “signal”) and the background (the “no ise”)) 
bias –  the  willingness to decide that you have detected a target stimulus 
o	 very biased  you w ill decide that you have seen the target with only a minimal 
difference between signal and noise 
o	 You change your bias by adjust ing your criterion – the thresho ld the signal must
exceed before you are willing to decide that you have seen the target 
If you set  the  criterion  too  low,  you  will  decide  tha t  you’ve  seen  the  target  even

when it’s not there because noise alone exceeds this threshold. 
Psychologists assess sensitivity and bias by comparing the occasions when people say a  stimulus is or 
is not present with the occasions when the stimulus is in fact present  or not . 
How Do Objects Enter the Mind? Let There Be Light
The eye registers light that is reflected from, or is produced by, objects in the line of sight. 
Propert ies of light: 
•	 Electromagnetic radiation 
•	 Waves 
o	 Amplitude –  he ight of the peaks in a  light  wave or  sound wave 
o	 Frequency – the number  of light  waves or sound waves that  move  past  a given point 
per second 
o	 Wavelength – distance between the arriva l of peaks of a light wave or sound wave 
Shorter wave lengths correspond to higher frequencies

We only see a narrow band w ithin the electromagnetic spectrum , but within this band, our eyes are
sensitive to slight differences in wavelength. 
•	 We perceive different wavelengths as different colors 
o	 Red: lower frequencies, longer wavelengths 
o	 Vio let: higher frequencies, shorter wavelengths 
The Brain’s Eye: More Than a Camera
Transduction – process whereby physical energy is converted by a sensory receptor cell into neural 
signals 
Pupil – opening in the eye  where  light enters / passes 
Iris – circular  muscle that adjusts the  size  of the  pupil to  let  in more  or less light
Cornea – transparent  covering over the eye, which (along with the  lens) focuses light onto the back of
the eye 
Lens –  fine-tunes  focusing  of  light; muscles can adjust the  lens into a  more  or less round shape  to
focus light from objects that are different distances away 
•  With age, the lens thickens and becomes less flexible, does not focus light as effect ively 
o	 Ex: old people have trouble seeing nearer objects 
Accomodation – automatic adjustment  of the eye for seeing at particular distances, which occurs
when muscles adjust the shape of the lens so that it focuses incoming light toward the back of
the eye (the retina) 
Transduction: From Photons  to Neurons  
Retina – sheet of t issue at the back of the eye conta ining ce lls that convert light to neural signals 
Fovea – small, centra l region of the retina with the highest density of cones and the highest resolution 
Please pardon any spelling errors or typos!

•  Gives rise to  the sharpest  images 
The density of receptor cells drops off toward the periphery of the retina, and thus images that are
transduced form peripheral portions of the retina are not as sharp as those transduced from the
central region. But, the world looks sharp and clear because we are constantly moving our eyes to
focus object in different locations s that they each land on the fovea at some point in time . 
2 kinds of receptor ce lls in the ret ina important for transducing light to neura l signals:
1.	 Rods –  rod-shaped retinal receptor cells that are very sensitivity to light (respond to all

wavelengths of light), but register only shades of gray

a.	 Each eye contains 100 –  120 million rods 
b.	 Not  in the fovea 
c.	 Night vision is based on the  firing of the rods alone 
2.	 Cones – cone-shaped retinal receptor cells that respond most strongly to one of three
wavelengths of light ; the combined signals from cones that are most sensitive to different
wavelengths play a key role in producing color vision 
a.	 not as sensitive to  light as the rods; allow us to see color 
b.	 Each eye contains 5 –  6 million cones 
c.  Densest in the fovea 
Axons from rods and cones connect to retinal gang lion cells, whose axons in turn are gathered into the 
optic nerve – large bundle  of axons carrying neura l signals from the retina  into the bra in 
Blind spot –  place where the optic nerve exits the retina; there  are no rods or  cones here 
Dark Adaptation – process that leads to increased sensit ivity to light a fter be ing in the  dark
After about 30 minutes in the dark, you are about 100,000 times more sensitive to light than you are 
when you are in full daylight. 
•	 Part of this increased sensitivity to what light there is arises because your pupil enlarges when 
you are in darkness. In addition, darkness causes the rods to release rhodopsin, which makes 
the rods more sensitive to light. 
More than Rods and Cones 
Mice genetically modified so that their eyes had no rods or cones st ill shifted the ir circadian behavior
when light was shine on them. Removing the ir eyes eliminated the mice’s responses to light.
Animals have some way to detect light that does not depend on rods and cones, but this mechanism
does lie in the eyes.
Berson et al. (2002) – the third type of light receptor  is a special type  of ganglion cell in the  retina 
Color Vision: Mixing and Matching
Colors vary along 3 different dimensions:
1.	 Hue –  different wavelengths of light produce sensations of different colors (ex: whether
something looks red, blue , etc.) 
2.	 Saturation – deepness of the color , how litt le white is missed in w ith it 
3.	 Lightness – amplitude  of the  light  waves (how much light  is present) produces the perception
of lightness (if the light is reflected from an object) or brightness (if the object produces light)
Different combinations of values on these 3 dimensions produce the rich palette of co lors we see. 
Color Mixing
Young & Helmholtz –  mixing of colors to  produce new colors 
•	 We see hue when the eye combines responses to separate wavelengths 
•	 Trichromatic theory of color vision - the  eye conta ins 3 kinds of co lor sensors, each most 
sensitive to a particular range of wavelengths: long (red); medium (green); short (blue). The
particular mix of responses of these sensors produces the sensation of a given hue
Although each type of cone responds maximally to a part icular wave length, it also responds to some 
degree to a range of similar wave lengths.

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 3 – Sensation and Perception: How the World Enters the Mind 

ii.	

The brain responds to the mixture of the responses from the 3 types of cones, not to isolated
individual cones. 
The results of mixing colors depend on whether the light waves being sensed are emitted or reflected: 
•	 When the light is emitted (ex: from a TV screen), the wavelengths of each contribut ing hue are
added. 
•	 When the light is reflected (ex: from a photo in a book), the wavelengths of each contributing
hue are subtracted. 
A Color Tug-Of-War? 
Hering – noticed that whereas some pa irs of colors can be mixed to make one color having a t inge of
the other (ex: ye llow with a tinge of red), the same is not true of other pa irs of colors (ex: red
mixed with green gives you brown) 
•	 Opponent process theory of color vision – for some pairs of co lors, if one of the co lors is
present, it causes cells to inhibit sensing the complementary co lor (such as red versus green) in
that location 
a.	 Red inhibits green; yellow inhibits blue ; black inhibits white; vice versa 
b.	 Explains afterimages –  image  left behind by a previous perception 
i.  Cones feed into opponent cells in the  retina and in part of the  tha lamus 
1.	 Opponent cells – ce lls that respond to one color  from a pair
(blue/yellow, red/green, or black/white), and inhibit sensing the other 
color from the pair 
If you stare at a color, (ex: red), after a while the cones that register it become
adapted to that st imulus, and they stop firing. If you then look at a white
background, the green cones will respond more strongly than the red ones, and
these green cones thereby stimulate the red/green opponent cells more
strongly than do the red ones, and thus, you see green. 
The trichromatic and opponent process theories are both correct, but describe separate systems that 
work together! 
Color Blindness – acquired (by bra in damage) or  inherited inability to distinguish two or  more hues
from each other or to sense hues at all 
Most common: red/green 
For most people w ith red/green color blindness, the problem arises because their red and 
•	
green cones have the same colored substance that filters the incoming light . Thus, the 2 types
of cones do not respond to different wavelengths as they should, leading 2 hues to appear the 
same. 
•	 Color blindness from brain damage usually results from damaging the bottom portion of the
temporal lobe . These people cannot distinguish hue – see the world as if in a black-and-white 
photo . 
Phase 1 of Visual Perception: Organizing the Visual World
Separate the figure from the ground: 
Figure –  set  of perceptua l characteristics (ex: shape, co lor, texture) that typically corresponds
•	
to an object 
•	 Ground – background 
Perceptual constancy – the  perception that characteristics of objects (ex: shapes, co lors) rema in the
same even when the sensory informat ion striking the eyes changes 
Size constancy – the perception that the actual size  of an object rema ins the same  even when it
is viewed at different distances 

•

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 3 – Sensation and Perception: How the World Enters the Mind 

Shape constancy – the perception that the actual shape  of an object remains the same , even 
•	
when it is seen from different points of view and so the image on the retina changes shape 
•	 Color constancy – the perception that the  co lor of an object  rema ins the same even when it is
seen in different lighting conditions 
o	 Monkeys raised in light of only a  single hue have an impa ired ability to  see colors as 
constant. 
o	
Studies of brain mechanisms of color constancy suggest that it may occur because we
see the lightest thing in a scene as white (no matter what the lighting conditions) and
the co lor of everything  else  is  re lative  to  that  white.  
Knowing the Distance
Examining how far away objects are from you and how far they are from each other helps you: 
Separate figure from ground 
•	
•	 Preserve size constancy 
•	 Preserve shape constancy 
•	 Guide navigation and reaching 
We need to know the relative positions of objects in 3D space , but images are projected onto the 2D
surface of our retinas. 
Cues we can use to derive 3D from 2D: 
Static Cues 
•  Binocular cues – cues to the distance of an object  that arise from both eyes working together 
o	 Convergence – degree to which the eyes sw ivel toward the center (are crossed) when a
person focuses attention on an object 
 The more you have to cross your eyes, the closer the object 
•	 Retinal disparity – difference between the images striking the ret inas of the 2 eyes 
o	 Used by the brain to determine which objects are in front and which are behind others 
o	 Only works to about 10 feet 
•	 Monocular cues – the difference between the  images striking the retinas of the  2 eyes, aka 
binocular disparity 
o	 Often used by artists to create  the  illusion of distance 
o	 Texture gradient – an increase  in the density of the texture of an object  with increasing 
distance 
o	 Other cues: linear perspective , foreshortening, atmospheric perspective , occlusion cues 
o	 Cross-cultural studies have shown that people are not born w ith the ability to interpret
some monocular cues in drawings – they must  learn to do so 
Motion Cues – specify the distance of an object on the basis of its movement ; work well with one or
two eyes 
•	 Motion para llax – a  motion cue in which the way that objects seem to  shift with movement
provides information about how far away they are 
Phase 2 of Visual Perception: Identifying Objects and Positions
2 Goa ls accomplished by 2 separate pathways:
1.	
Identify objects  “what” pathway: occipital lobe to bottom  of tempora l lobe 
2.  Identify spatial re lations  “where” pathway: occipital lobe to back of parietal lobe 
Evidence : 
1.	 Lesion studies 
2.	 Neuroimaging

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 3 – Sensation and Perception: How the World Enters the Mind 

The fina l phases of perceptua l processing allow the perceptua l units organized during Phase 1 to
access information you’ve stored in memory from your prior experience.
The Phase 1 processes that separate figure from ground sometimes organize a shape into a set of 
distinct parts, and in Phase 2 processing, these parts can serve as the basis for
 identifying the object.
We can see parts of an object individually, but it is also clear that we do not always identify objects in
terms of their individual parts. (Ex: picture of Britney Spears – you don’t not ice that some of 
the parts in the face are upside down) 
•  We usually focus on the overall views of shapes and look for details only if we need them . 
Informed Perception: The Active Viewer
Bottom-up processing – processing that is triggered by physical energy striking receptor ce lls 
Imagine : dominoes  When the neural equivalent of the first domino is tripped by the light
•	
waves reaching our eye , other neural signa ls are successive ly tripped, like falling dominoes, 
unt il you’ve understood what you’re seeing. 
Top-down processing – processing that is guided by knowledge , expectation, or be lief 
•	 Allows you to impose what you want to see on what is actually out there 
•  Does not change how you see an object, but instead just makes it easier to  organize or interpret 
Bottom-up processing and top-down processing are often in play at the same  time!! 
Top-down processing can affect  the way you interpret the results from bottom-up processing. 
•	 Delk & Fillenbaum –  people were asked to use a dia l to adjust a sample color until they thought
it matched the color of the background cut-out.  
o	 When asked to match the co lor of the norma lly red objects, the participants
consistently se lected a redder color than the one they chose to match the color of 
objects that are not normally red. 
 The knowledge of the usual co lor of the objects affected, via top-down 
processing, how participants saw the actual color . 
Top-down processing can be guided by your perceptual set – the sum  of assumptions and be liefs that 
lead a person to expect to perceive certain objects or characteristics in particular contexts. 
Coding Space in the Brain: More Than One Way to Identify “Where”
The main goa l of processing in the “where” pathway is to use the sum total of the distance cues to 
identify the distance and direct ion of objects, either relative to yourself or relat ive to other
objects. 
Kosslyn –  proposed that  the  brain uses 2 different ways to  specify spatial relations 
•	 Categorical spatial relations –  specify relative  positions with categories such as “above,”
“beside,” etc.; don’t give you a particular , specific spot but instead, gives you a group of
possible locations 
o	 Don’t help w ith 2 main tasks of vision: 
•	 Providing information to guide navigation and reaching 
•	 Coordinate spatial relations – specify continuous distances from your  body or  another object that
serves as an “origin” of a coordinate space
Evidence of this comes from studies of cerebral lateralization – how funct ions are accomplished in the 
left hemisphere versus the right hemisphere of the brain 
•	 Left cerebra l hemisphere – better  at identifying categorical spatial relations 
•	 Right hemisphere – better at ident ifying coordinate spat ial re lations, which are essent ial for 
navigation 
o	 Patients with damage to the  left hemisphere have more difficulty using categorical
spatial relations than coordinate spatial re lations, vice versa .

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 3 – Sensation and Perception: How the World Enters the Mind 

Attention: The Gateway to Awareness
Attention – the act  of focusing on particular  information, which allows it to  be  processed more  fully 
than what is not attended to 
•	 We are only aware of what we attend to 
Reasons why we pay attention:
1.	 The stimulus grabs our attention (bottom-up) 
2.	 We are actively searching for it (top-down) 
Paying attent ion increases sensit ivity to the attended events 
Selective attention – the process of picking out and maintaining focus on a particular quality, object, 
or event, and ignoring other stimuli or characteristics of the stimuli 
Pop -Out: What Grabs Attention? 
Pop-out –occurs when perceptual characteristics of a stimulus are sufficiently different from the ones 
around it that it immediately or automatically (via bottom-up processing) comes to our 
attention 
Active Searching : Not Just What Grabs Attention
In some situations, what we see / hear influences what we expect , which in turn directs our attent ion. 
Another use of top-down processing occurs when you anticipate a particular event and thus ma inta in
attention as you wa it for it 
We cannot a lways use top-down processing to  focus on 1 characteristic and shut out others. Bottom-
up processing keeps us perceptually honest –  we see what’s there , not just  what  we want  to 
see. 
Seeing Without Awareness
Blindsight – visua l perceptual processes cannot be at work (often because of damage to V1), but we
can still “see” (ex: avo id obstacles when walking, etc.) 
•	 The optic nerve branches into separate pathways, which lead to different place sin the brain,
and one of these pathways bypasses the primary visua l cortex, which is a brain area crucial for
visua l consciousness –the  awareness  of  seeing.  Instead,  this  pathway  leads  direct ly  to  the
parietal lobe , which allows people to know the locations of visual stimuli –  even when the 
brain areas crucia l for visual consciousness (or connections from these areas) are damaged. 
Repetit ion blindness –  ex: A bird in the hand is worth two  in the the bush; the  inability to see  the
second instance of a stimulus when it appears soon after the first instance 
•	 Results because repeated stimuli are registered not as individua l events but simply  as  a  single  
“type” of event .
Change blindness –  not  seeing large alterations of features as scenes change over  time  if those features
are not of centra l interest 
Attentional blink –  a rebound period in which a person cannot  pay attention to a  second stimulus 
after having just paid attention to another one (which need not be the same as the second 
stimulus); occurs for pairs of stimuli, but unlike repetition blindness, can occur for paris of
different st imuli 
HEARING 
Auditory Sensation: If a Tree Falls But Nobody Hear It, Is There a Sound?
Auditory sensations begin when physical energy strikes the ear, at which po int that energy (in the
form of waves of pressure) is transduced into neural signals. 

Please pardon any spelling errors or typos!

9.00 EXAM 1 NOTES 
KOSSLYN CHAPTER 3 – Sensation and Perception: How the World Enters the Mind 

Sound Waves: Being Pressured
Sound arises when any type of mo lecules move and create pressure waves that enter our ears.
Pressure waves that give rise to sound are periodic, have frequency (units = Hz) and amplitude
Pitch –  how high or low a  sound seems; higher  frequencies of pressure  waves produce  the  experience  
of higher pitches
Loudness – strength of a  sound; pressure waves w ith greater amplitude  produce  the experience  of
louder sound (units = dB) 
Answer: If a tree falls in the forest but nobody hears it , there is no sound. Sound is caused by pressure 
waves, but the waves themselves are not sound. Sound is a psychologica l event, and hence
depends on a nervous system  to transduce  the physical energy of the waves to nerve signa ls. 
The Brain’s Ear: More Than A Microphone 
 See p. 105 for Anatomy of the Ear 
3 Parts: outer ear , middle ear, inner ear
The eardrum (tympanic membrane ) stretches across  the inside end of the auditory canal, and
everything between the eardrum and the auditory nerve is designed to convert movements of
the eardrum to the nerve signals that are sent to the brain. 
Pressure waves move the eardrum  moves 3 bones (hammer , anvil, stirrup) in the middle ear 
transfer / amplify vibration  basilar  membrane vibration (different frequencies of sound are 
transduced into the nerve signals that underlie auditory sensation)  ha ir cells on the receptor
cells lining the basilar membrane are moved by the vibrations and trigger nerve signals  sent 
to the brain 
2 theories about how the basilar membrane converts pressure waves to sound sensations: 
1.	 Frequency theory –  higher frequencies produce higher  rates of neural firing 
2.	 Place theory –  different frequencies activate different places along the basilar membrane 
Deafness: Hear Today , Gone Tomorrow
>28 million Americans have some sort of difficulty in hearing 
Conduction deafness – caused by physical impairment of the outer or  middle ear 
•  Ex: broken ear-drum; ossification of middle ear bones 
Nerve deafness –  occurs when the hair  cells are destroyed by loud sounds 
•	 Once a ha ir cell is destroyed,  it  is  gone  forever  
•	 Nerve deafness may impair our ability to hear only certa in frequencies; in these cases, a
hearing aid can amplify the remaining frequencies, improving hearing 
Phase 1 of Auditory Perception: Organizing the Auditory World 
Sorting  Out Sounds: From One, Many
Auditory scene analysis – distinguishing individual sounds to separate auditory figure from ground
Gesta lt laws of organization apply here as we ll: similarity (grouping sounds w ith the same pitch);
continuation (grouping the same  pitch  continued  over  time)  
Speech-segmentation problem –  the  problem  of organiz ing a  continuous stream of speech into
separate parts that correspond to individual words 
•	 Words do not have pauses between them when we speak, but we can nonetheless ident ify  
individual words. 
Categorical perception –  automatically grouping sounds as members of distinct categories that
correspond to the basic units of speech

•	

Infants, monkeys, chinchillas, etc. engage in categorical perception; suggesting that the
perceptual system itself does the work, not the  language systems of our various cultures. 
Locating Sounds : Why Two Ears Are Better Than One
Hearing makes use of differences in the stimuli reaching the 2 ears to assess the distance of a sound 
source. 
Difference in loudness at  the  two ears is used as a cue for both the distance  and position of the object 
making the sound.
Our heads block sound, and amplitude of a pressure wave is smaller when it reaches the ear on the
side of the head away from the sound source  effective for high-frequency sounds
Some cues still depend on one ear , though! (Ex: moving closer or farther from a sound source) 
Phase 2 of Auditory Perception: Identifying Objects and Positions 
More than Meets the Ear 
You can adjust your criterion for  “detecting  a  signal,”  and  this  adjustment  w ill  be  based  on  what  you  
expect to hear.
Warren & Warren –  people  listened to  a tape-recorded sentence after part of a word had been replaced 
with the sound of a cough. 
•	 Phonemic restoration effect – although part of the word was actually missing, all the
participants claimed that they actually heard the entire word and denied that the cough
covered part of it. Some weren’t even sure that the cough occurred. 
o  Does not just apply to speech sounds; also in music (see ing a cello be ing plucked is 
enough to a lter the sound we hear)
The sound of music is affected by top-down processing but also that visual information can cross over
and affect auditory processing. Neuroimaging studies also show that vision can modify how sound is 
processed in the brain. 
Hearing Without Awareness
Cockta il party phenomenon – the effect of not being aware of other people’s conversations until your
name  is mentioned and then suddenly hearing it 
•	 To be aware of the sound, you had to be aware of the conversat ion (bottom-up processing), 
but you weren’t aware of it unt il your name was spoken.
Dichotic listening – a procedure  in which participants hear  different stimuli presented separately to
each of the two ears (through headphones) and are instructed to  listen only to sounds 
presented to one ear 
•	 People st ill register some  information from the  ignored ear (ex: whether the voice  is ma le or
female) 
Spurred myth that people can learn in the ir sleep 
•	
•	 Unless people are paying attent ion, very little  information  is  perceived;  even  when  that
information is perce ived, it is reta ined very briefly, and when tested hours later , people
remember virtually none of it 
Specifying Positions
The auditory and visua l perceptual mechanisms that specify position have  much  in  common.  
Both sorts of processing can specify the posit ion of an object re lative to  the body or relative to other
objects and apparently do so in similar ways  rely on the same portions of the  parieta l lobes 
The 2 processes often work together when we note the positions of objects. 
•	 People can locate a stimulus in the dark sole ly on the basis of the sound it emits more

accurately if they move the ir eyes toward the source of the sound than if they do not.

SENSING AND PERCEIVING IN OTHER WAYS 
Smell: A Nose for News? 
Smell and taste are often grouped together as the chemical senses because both rely on registering the

presence of specific chemicals.

In general, people are bad at identifying odors, but people differ widely in the ir sense of smell.

•	 Women are generally better than men at detecting many types of odors. 
•	 Younger adults are better at detecting odors than either children (<14 years) or middle-aged 
adults (40-50 years) 
Distinguishing Odors: Lock and Key
Molecules have different shapes, and the olfactory receptors are  built  so  that  only molecules with
particular shapes w ill fit in particular places on the receptors. When the specific molecule fits into a
particular receptor, the receptor sends a signal to the brain, and we sense the odor . 
There is not a single receptor for each odor we smell – the overa ll pattern of receptor activity signals a 
particular odor.
Buck & Axel – ident ified the genes that produce the individual odor receptors 
The sense of smell is tightly bound to emotions and  to  memories.  
1.	 2 major neura l pathways send signals about odor into the brain: 
a.	
connected to the limbic system –  involved I emotions 
b.	 passes through the thalamus – involved in memory 
2.	 Neuroimaging studies have shown that the  left cerebral hemisphere plays a special role in
emotiona l responses to odors and that the right cerebral hemisphere plays a special role in
memory for odors. 
a.	 The axona l connections between the two hemispheres expla in how the odors and
memories tap into each other . 
Olfaction Gone Awry: Is It Safe to Cook Without Smell? 
Smell serves to signal the presence of noxious substances. Our bra ins are wired so that odors can
quickly activate the stress  response  – the bodily changes that occur  to help a  person cope w ith a 
stressor . 
We use smell as a warning that something is amiss. (Ex: smell is often the only signal that food / meat
is spo iled.) 
Pheromones : Another Kind of Scents? 
Pheromones –  chemicals that function like  hormones but  are re leased outside the body (in urine and
sweat); serve as  a  means  of  communication;  modulate  the  functions  of  various  organs
Perfume manufacturers exploit pheromones. 
Taste: The Mouth Has It 
Taste buds – receptor cells for taste , which are microscopic structures on the  bumps on the  tongue
surface, at the back of the throat, and inside the cheeks 
•	 Die and are replaced, on average , every 10 days. 
Sweet, Sour, Salty , Bitter, and More
The flavors of food arose from combinations of 4 tastes: sweet , sour , sa lty, and bitter
Fifth taste : umami –  arises from  the  amino acid glutamate (think MSG in Chinese food!)
In addition to the 5 types of taste receptors, dendrites of neurons in the mouth appear to be  irritated
by spicy foods. 
Taste and Smell 
People have a much harder time detect ing flavors when smell is blocked.

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 3 – Sensation and Perception: How the World Enters the Mind 

SOMASTHETIC SENSES: NOT JUST SKIN DEEP 
Somasthetic senses – senses that produce the perception of the body and its position in space – 
specifically, kinesthetic sense (awareness of where the limbs are and how they move),
vest ibular sense (sense of ba lance), touch, tempera ture sensitivity, pa in, and possibly magnetic 
sense 
•	 Arguable : extrasensory perception (ESP) 
Kinesthetic Sense: A Moving Sense?
Kinesthetic sense –  registers the  movement  and position of the limbs
2 types of specialized cells sense this information: 
1.	 Tendons –  materia ls that connect  muscles to bones; triggered by tension 
2.	 Muscles – contraction / stretching 
Vestibular Sense: Being Oriented
Vest ibular sense –  provides information about the body’s orientation relative  to gravity; re lies on 
semicircular canals of inner ear 
Touch : Feeling Well
Skin – body’s largest organ 
•  Protects body from the environment ; makes crucia l vitamins, triggers release of hormones
Because of the many ways that signals from receptors in the skin can be combined, we  can  fee l  may  
more types of sensations than we have types of receptors.
Receptor ce lls in the skin over different parts of the body send neural signals to different parts of the
somatosensory cortex; somatosensory cortex preserves a map of the body, w ith neurons in different 
locations of cortex indicat ing that different locations of the body have been st imulated. 
•	 The larger the portion of somatosensory cortex devoted to a particular area of the skin, the
more sensitive we are to st imulation of that area. 
Temperature
There are distinct spots on your skin that register only hot or only cold. 
If a cold spot is stimulated, you will feel a sensation of co ld even if the stimulus is something
•	
hot. 

Pain 
Pain can warn us of impending danger and is crucial to survival. 
The sensation of pain arises primarily when e ither of 2 different neural pathways are stimulated, each
of which underlies a different type of pain. Because the 2 pathways differ in the speed with which
they transmit signals, we can feel double pa in – the sensation that occurs when an injury first causes a 
sharp pain and later a dull pa in
Endorphins – painkilling chemicals produced naturally in he bra in
Pain involves bottom-up and top-down processing. 
•	 Gate contro l – the  mechanism that allows top-down processing to  inhibit  interneurons that 
send pain signa ls to the bra in 
o	 Can explain how hypnosis influences pa in  selectively make pain feel less unpleasant
but make person st ill aware of the intensity of the pain; a lters processing in only some
of the areas that register pain 
o	 Acupuncture – the needles are a  counter-irritant , reducing the pa in by introducing 
painful stimuli elsewhere in the body 

Other Senses? 
Magnetic Senses: Only for Birds?
Bird migration is guided by the earth’s magnetic field – the birds have  tiny bits of iron in neurons.

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 3 – Sensation and Perception: How the World Enters the Mind 

Mole rats / mice – magnetic fields disrupt spatial learning for brief periods of t ime 
Extrasensory Perception (ESP) – ability to  perceive and know things w ithout using the ordinary senses 
AKA anomalous cognition, psi 
•	 Telepathy –  the  ability to transmit  thoughts directly from mind to  mind 
•	 Clairvoyance – ability to  perceive events without using the ordinary senses or reading
someone else’s mind 
•	 Precognition – ability to forete ll future events 
•	 Psychokinesis – ability to  move objects simply by willing them  to move , and not by

manipulating them physically

4 reasons to be skeptical:
1.	 Failure to replicate 
2.	 Lack of bra in mechanism 
3.	 Lack of signals 
4.	 Alternative explanations
