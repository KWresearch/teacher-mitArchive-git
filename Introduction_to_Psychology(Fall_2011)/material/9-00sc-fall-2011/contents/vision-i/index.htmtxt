Describe in detail the pathway that transmits visual information from the eye
to the primary vision areas in the brain. Also describe the function of each
component of the eye when processing visual information.
âº View/hide answer
Light enters through the cornea, which begins to focus the light. The light
passes through the pupil and through the lens, which focuses the light onto the
retina. Retina cells called rods and cones begin to process visual information.
Rods respond black, white, and gray colors. Rods do not provide much detail of
an image, but respond well in dim light and are important for peripheral
vision. Cones respond to color and can detect fine details in an image. Cones
respond most to bright light and are mostly located in the center of the
retina, called the fovea. Visual information then passes through the bipolar
cells to the ganglion cells. From there the visual information is transmitted
down the optic nerve to the thalamus, and finally to primary visual cortex in
the occipital lobe.
