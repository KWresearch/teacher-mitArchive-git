Objectives
• Purposes of vision

• Problems that the visual system has to 
overcome

• Neural organization of vision

Human Perceptual Abilities

• Detect a candle, 30 miles away, on a dark, clear night
• Detect cochlear displacement equal to the width of a 
hydrogen atom 
• Taste one teaspoon of sugar even when it is mixed 
into two gallons of water
• Smell a drop of perfume diffused into the space of a 
three bedroom apartment

PURPOSES OF VISION

1. OBJECT RECOGNITION

2.  NAVIGATION

PURPOSES OF VISION

1. OBJECT RECOGNITION (what)
link a unique image to what we know
objects have many possible versions
• face - illumination, angle, distance, expression, shadows, occlusion
• letters - fonts, handwriting
• body - all the ways a person stands
problems of equivalence (same shape, different viewing conditions)
• size constancy
• shape constancy
• position constancy
problems of generalization (different shape, same object or type of object)
• addition or deletion of optional parts
• changes in the shapes of parts
• changes in spatial relations among parts
problems of impoverished input (partial information)
• occlusion
• poor lighting
• multiple eye fixations
2.  NAVIGATION (where)
go through space, track
• sources of movement - eyes, head, body, objects

John Locke and Perception
tabula rosa (blank slate)

Let us suppose the mind to be, as we say, a 
white paper void of all characters, without 
any ideas: - How comes it to be furnished? 
Whence comes it by that vast store which the 
busy and boundless fancy of man has painted 
on it with an almost endless variety? 

Whence has it all the materials of reason and 
knowledge? 

To this I answer, in one word. 
EXPERIENCE. In that all our knowledge is 
founded; and from that it ultimately derives 
itself (Locke, 1690).

Perception

• Objectivist view (“blank slate” view)
– Our senses precisely, and accurately, reflect the 
physical world. They provide us with a true, 
complete, and accurate representation. 

• Subjectivist view (Gestalt)
– There is no inherent organization to the world, but 
rather, our brain organizes our perceptions, and we 
therefore believe the world is, itself, organized. 

Gestalt Principles

• In this view, our perceptions may be likened to 
the output of a piano: these perceptions are 
evoked by the world, much as the piano melody 
is evoked by the pianist. 
• A piano can only emit its own notes – it can’t 
sound like a clarinet. Similarly perceptions are 
evoked by the world, but they generate 
experiences limited by the neural structures of 
our brain. 
• Our percepts are evoked by nature; but they are 
personal and not a copy of nature. 

Vision
• vision is an interpretation of the world around 
us
• visual illusions demonstrate the gap between 
what is out there and how our minds and 
brains interpret what is out there
• illusions are rare because our minds and 
brains have evolved to have interpretations 
that almost always work brilliantly in our 
environment without us having to think 
about it

The Problem of Brightness Constancy

• ambient brightness varies greatly
outdoor sun, cloud
indoor, bright, less bright
shadows
- piece of coal in sunlight may reflect 
10x as much light as snow in the shade
• but we recognize things by their brightness
• so we use unconscious inference to perceive
an object’s brightness 

Hering, Wallach:

ce ratios across edges and 
Observer simply computes luminan
evel analyses about shape 
does not need to perform any high-l
or illumination; use ratio at edges.

Perception: Our Approach
• Objectivist view (“blank slate” view)
– Our senses precisely, and accurately, reflect the 
physical world. They provide us with a true, 
complete, and accurate representation. 
• Subjectivist view (Gestalt)
– There is no inherent organization to the world, but 
rather, our brain organizes our perceptions, and we 
therefore believe the world is, itself, organized.
• Synthetic view
– The world appears to us the way it does because:
(1) We perceive only within the limits of our 
nervous system
(2) Our nervous system has evolved to reflect 
portions of the world very accurately.
