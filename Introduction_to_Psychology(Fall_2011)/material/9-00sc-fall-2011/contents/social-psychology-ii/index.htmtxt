***** Session Overview *****
                                   How important are first impressions? Do you
                                   ever make judgments about others? Do you
                                   feel that others judge you? In this session,
                                   we will focus on our impressions of others
                                   and ourselves and examine the extent to
                                   which our environment and culture can
                                   influence us. We will also discuss autism.
