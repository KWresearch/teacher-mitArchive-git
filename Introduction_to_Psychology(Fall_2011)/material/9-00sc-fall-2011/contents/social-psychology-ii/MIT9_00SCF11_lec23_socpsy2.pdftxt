SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY II

• Self Concept 
Above Average 
False Consensus 
Cognitive Dissonance 
• Impressions of Others 
• Cultural Differences 
• Autism  

ENHANCING OUR VIEWS 

OF OURSELVES

• most U.S. college students rate themselves as 
better than average students 
• 1 million high-school students rated their 
leadership; 28% average; 70% above average; 
2% below average; 60% in top 10% in ability to 
get along with others 
• 94% of college instructors rated themselves as 
better than average teachers 

ENHANCING OUR VIEWS 

OF OURSELVES

• self-serving attributional bias 
success reflects our traits, not 
situation 
• did well on tests of sensory or 
perceptual discrimination, social 
sensitivity, competitive game - me 
(poorly, the situation) 
• can be extended to family, social and 
political groups, sports teams 

Constructing social reality

•In the final game of the season, an undefeated Princeton 
played Dartmouth. It was a hard fought game, and Princeton 
won. 
•School newspapers had totally different accounts. 
•Hastorf and Cantril (1954) showed a film of the game to 
students at each of the two campuses. 
•Princeton students judged the game as dirty, 
thought Dartmouth started the dirty play, and “saw” Dartmouth 
commit twice as many penalties. 
•Dartmouth students saw both as blameworthy, and “saw” an 
equal number of penalties on each side. 

Realistic Depression & Illusory Optimism

• depressed and non-depressed students 
given tasks that varied in degree of 
contingency (Alloy & Abramson, 1979) 
• estimate degree of contingency 
between response (button presses) and 
outcome (green light going on) 
• depressed students more accurate, 
non-depressed students overestimated 
contingency when outcomes were 
desired, underestimated when 
outcomes were undesired 

False Consensus

(Ross et al., 1977)

•	 People choosing to engage in a behavior
believe that their choice is more common 
than do people making the opposite choice 
•	 Carry around sign on campus “Eat at Joe’s”
for 30 min - agree, 62% of others will do so; 
disagree, 33% of others will do so 
•	 Example: Teenage smokers estimate higher
rates of smoking than non-smokers
(Sherman et al., 1983); domestic abusive
men estimate that about 28% of men have 
violently thrown things at partner (vs. 12%)
(Neighbors et al., 2010) 

WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CAR? 


• Zimbardo (1980) 
• two identical cars - one in upper-middle  

class Palo Alto; one in tough Bronx area

• Bronx - no license plate; hood up; 
stripped within a day 
• Palo Alto - untouched for a week -
smashed a window - stripped within an 
hour

Attitudes vs. Actions 
• Daffodil Days - buy a daffodil - 4-day 
campus event to benefit American 
cancer Society 
• 251 Cornell students 
83% predicted they would buy at 
least one flower vs. 56% of 

peers 
43% actually bought a daffodil 

COGNITIVE DISSONANCE

• Leon Festinger, 1957 
• discrepancy between attitudes and 
action (behavior) - conflict 
• do a boring task (packing & unpacking 
spools in a tray, turning many screws 
for a quarter turn) 
• get $1 or $20 to lie and tell next person 
that task was interesting, worthwhile 
• really, how was task?

COGNITIVE DISSONANCE 
• post-decisional 
Jack Brehm, 1956, carted wedding gifts 
to lab 
rate how much you want desk lamp, 
toaster, stopwatch, radio, etc. 
select between two that were equally 
desirable 
rate again - upgraded the chosen 
item, downgraded rejected item 
(unless examiner picks for them) 
• colleges, cars vs. trucks, CDs 

COGNITIVE DISSONANCE 
• effort 
courses 
1959 - to qualify for a research study, 
some women were required to read 
aloud obscene words or mild 
words to male experimenter - then 
listened to boring lecture on 
mating habits of lower animals -
lecture rated better by difficult 
qualification 
why did I do that painful thing?

Operational Definition 


Norman & Goldberg (1966), University of Michigan

•	 Students rate people’s personality on first day of
class before introduction 
•	 Correlation with self-rating, especially “sociable”
and “responsible” 

Kenny (1988) 
•	 250 students, divided into 4 groups who did not
know each other, had not spoken together 
•	 Rated - sociable, good-natured, responsible, 
calm, intellectual (traits of extraversion,
conscientiousness) - good agreement with self 
ratings 
•	 But how good are we at rating ourselves? 

Self ratings? (Levesque & Kenny, 1993) 
•	 4 strangers rate each other on 5 traits 
•	 Meet in pairs, videotaped 
•	 Judges watched tape, rated extroversion -
time talking, arm movements 
•	 First impressions correlated strongly with 
videotape ratings for selves & others 

Nalani Ambady (1993) - “thin slices” 
•	 Videotaped 13 graduate TAs 
•	 3 random 10 sec clips, 30 sec per TA 
•	 Showed silent clips to students 
•	 13 ratings - accepting, active, competent, 
confident 
•	 Correlated global rating with actual end-at-
semester rating with students 
•  + 0.76 correlation 
•	 15 sec? 6 sec? 
• listen to 20 secs of physician speaking during 
routine office visit, above-chance prediction of 
which were sued for malpractice 

High school teachers? 

Better teachers? 

5 students - 1 “teacher” - teachers prepared  

brief math lesson - students took test 
-
strangers rate 10 sec videos of teachers 

High rating correlated with high test-scores


First Impressions 
Prior information (Schema) 
MIT 1950 
Guest lecturer

- 50% students

-“People who know him consider him to be a

(very warm or rather cold) person, industrious, 

critical, practical, and determined.”

guest appears, leads 20-minute discussion 

Evaluation (very warm)

- Rated lecturer better 

- Took more part in discussion

First impressions hard to change because new information
is interpreted to be consistent with already formed
impressions 

First Impressions 
Prior information 
self-fulfilling prophecy 

• elementary school, gave test to students

• told teacher who would have good/bad year 
• end of year: high scores > low scores

self-fulfilling prophecy 

• elementary school, gave test to students

• told teacher who would have good/bad year 
• end of year: high scores > low scores 

Physical Attractiveness


Physically attractive people judged more intelligent,
competent, sociable and moral 

5th grade teachers given report cards and
photographs of children they did not know 
–  Rate intelligence and achievement 
–  Attractive children rated brighter and more
successful than unattractive children with 
identical report cards 

Physical Attractiveness


Child’s misbehavior 
•	 Environmental circumstances if more attractive 
personality if less attractive 

Court cases, comparable crimes 
•	 Shorter sentences if more attractive 
•	 Longer sentences if less attractive 

Halo Effect


• global evaluation about a person 
bleeds over to a specific trait 
she is likable, so she is intelligent 

Halo Effect

• Nisbett & Wilson, 1977 -“cover story” -
students told study was to examine teacher 
evaluations; was it dependent on amount of 
exposure (cover)? 
• 2 groups saw videos of lecturer with strong 
Belgian accent - answered questions in a warm 
& friendly manner or a cold and distant manner 
• rated warm version as more attractive, likeable 
mannerisms, & less accent - without being 
aware of it (celebrity marketing?) 

Stereotypes
Stereotypes 


•In addition to asking “Why did he do this?” 
we also ask “What kind of person is he?” 
•To answer this question, we rely on short cuts 
and heuristics 
•These short cuts are necessary, but also can 
lead to stereotyping, or using simplified social 
schemas to define whole groups of people. 
•Stereotypes have bi-directional effects

•  In the “attractive” condition, women were seen as 

more sociable, poised, humorous, socially adept

•	 Participants changed their partner’s behavior 
with their expectations – what had been only a 
reality in the minds of the men became a reality in 
the behavior of the women they interacted with 
•	 Participants then formed an impression of the 

women based on that (changed) behavior

Models of Self 
Communities’ ideas about being a person and the 
social practices, situations, and institutions of 
everyday life that represent and foster these ideas. 

Independent Models 
• A person is fundamentally separate 
from others, stable, and consistent. 
• Actions are under personal control 
and guided by preferences and  needs. 
• Gives priority to personal needs over 
group goals. 
• Stands out,   	is unique, expresses the 
self 
• Values feeling good about oneself and 
high arousal, excitement 

Interdependent Models

• A person is fundamentally connected 
to others. 
• Actions are primarily guided by 
social norms and roles. 
•	 Subordinates personal needs and 
beliefs to maintain group harmony. 
• Meets obligations,  	 expectations, 
norms, fits in 
• Values self-reflection, self-criticism 
and low arousal, calm 

Relative vs. Absolute Size

Look at target stimulus - taken away - see new empty 
Box, draw line of either equal relative size or absolute 
Size 
Japanese subjects more accurate for relative size 
American subjects more accurate for absolute size 
How malleable? 

Figure 2. Framed-Line Test


(a) Participants were shown a square frame with a 
vertical line like the one at the top. They were then 
shown a new square frame of a different size and were 
asked to draw a line that was identical to the first line in 
either absolute length (absolute task), like the blue line 
at the bottom left, or in proportion to the surrounding 
frame (relative task), like the red line at the bottom right. 

(b) The error scores show that American 
participants were more accurate in the 
absolute task than the relative task, whereas 
Japanese were more accurate in the relative 
task, suggesting that Japanese were paying 
more attention to the frame than Americans 
were.

Figure 1. Categorization task 
(a) 

(b) 

(a) Participants were presented with a target 

object and two groups of four objects, and were 
asked to judge which group the target object 
was most similar to. In this example, all the 
objects in group 2 share the same stem as the 
target object, whereas the members in group 1 
share a large number of features with the target, 
although no one feature is shared by all the 

members. Thus, whereas the group 2 shares a 

unidimensional rule with the target, group 1 is  

holistically more similar to the target.

(b) European Americans much more

often perceived similarities based on

the unidimensional rule, but East 

Asians more frequently perceived 

similarities based on holistic judgments 

of family resemblance.


Fundamental Attribution Error


• disposition (personality) vs. situation 
• more emphasis on interpreting actions 
in terms of dispositions in US 
• more emphasis on interpreting actions 
in terms of situation in India, China, 
Japan, Korea 
• East Asians less susceptible to 
attractiveness bias than Westerners 

AUTISM


• prevalence 1/110-140 – 
dramatic increase in recent years 
(awareness?) 
• diagnosed by age 3 
• 4 males/1 female 
• social cognition different (impaired?)

• communication/language 
difficulty in many cases 
• stereotyped, repetitive movements 50
