***** Discussion: Thinking &amp; Intelligence *****
This discussion section covers thinking and intelligence. We'll discuss two
topics: whether we think in words or pictures, and some approaches to creative
problem solvingâ¦ Read_more_Â»

**** Short Answer Questions ****
1) What is intelligence? What is IQ? How are they related?
âº Sample Answer
Intelligence, as it is understood in psychological science, is "the ability to
reason and solve problems well and to understand and learn complex material"
(Kosslyn &amp; Rosenberg, 2011).
IQ (intelligence quotient) is a score on an intelligence test, based on
population and age norms.
In many cases, IQ is used as a measure (index) of intelligence, although
intelligence is a complex and multifaceted construct, whereas IQ is a single
number over many factors.
Â 
2) What are some examples of how IQ scores relate to real-world performance
outcomes? Does IQ tell the whole story? What other factors have been shown to
play a role in real-world performance?
âº Sample Answer
IQ has been shown to correlate with career success, financial success, marriage
stability, and avoiding jail. Other factors bear on real-world success too,
such as personality traits, motivation and ambition, and culture.
Â 
3) Many researchers have proposed different constructs that they claim capture
different factors in intelligence. Describe Spearman's g and how it relates to
the idea of intelligence. Compare and contrast fluid intelligence and
crystalized intelligence â what does each describe and how are they related?
âº Sample Answer
Spearman's g is a 'general factor' which is thought to underlie performance on
a variety of different intelligence tasks. For example, performance on many
subtests of intelligence are positively correlated (meaning that people with
high scores on one tend to have high scores on the others); the overall degree
of relatedness across tests is captured by g.
Fluid intelligence is the ability to reason about novel problems without
relying on specific past experiences; whereas crystallized intelligence relies
on applying specific past experiences and knowledge to problem solving. For
example, fluid intelligence supports the ability to find a solution when
familiar tools are unavailable, and crystallized intelligence supports the
ability to recall facts or procedures that are related to a problem at hand.
These intelligences work together. Fluid intelligence can draw on extensive
crystallized intelligence by abstracting general principles that will work in
new, previously unencountered situations.
