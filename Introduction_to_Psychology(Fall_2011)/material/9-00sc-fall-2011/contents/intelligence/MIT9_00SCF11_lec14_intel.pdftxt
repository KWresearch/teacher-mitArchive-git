WHAT IS INTELLIGENCE?

6

WHAT IS INTELLIGENCE?

• ability to solve problems 
• understand and learn complex material
• adapt to the environment
• mental quickness

7

WHAT MAKES SOMETHING 
AN EXPERIMENT?
dependent variable
what you measure - the outcome

independent variable
what you vary

Studies of intelligence are almost always 
correlational and rarely experimental
Studies of intelligence focus on differences 
among people rather than intelligence per se

IQ = Intelligence Quotient
• France, 1904-1911, universal 
elementary education
• Alfred Binet, physician, aimed for an 
objective way to identify children who 
needed extra help
• many abilities, many tests - copy a 
drawing, repeat digits, recognize coins, 
explain why a statement did not make 
sense

10

IQ = Intelligence Quotient
• give test to normal children at multiple 
ages 
• mental age vs. chronological age

11

IQ = Intelligence Quotient
• David Wechsler
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale for 
Children (WISC)
Verbal Subtests and Performance 
Subtests

12

WAIS - III

• Verbal Subtests
Vocabulary - define words
Similarities - how are an airplane and a 
car alike
Arithmetic - simple operations
Digit Span - digits in STM capacity
Information - who was Martin Luther 
King, Jr.?
Comprehension - why are there taxes?
13

WAIS - III
• Performance Subtests (nonverbal)
Picture Completion - what is missing?
Digit-Symbol Coding
Block Design
Matrix Reasoning
Picture Arrangement - order pictures

14

IQ = Intelligence Quotient
• give test to normal children at multiple 
ages 
• mental age (MA) vs. chronological age 
(CA)
IQ = (MA/CA) X 100
Average = 100

15

Standardized Test
• standardized sample - random population
• normal distribution
• norming (raw score vs. standardized 
score)
mean = 100 standard deviation = 15 for 
WAIS
67% of people are +/- 1sd (85-115); more 
than 2sd = 4.54%
Age norming - on 6th birthday - move from  
120/100 - 40 year-old like undergrad raw 
16
score = 230 IQ

< 70 a big problem

Top 2% = Mensa

17

RELIABILITY & VALIDITY
• Reliable - same score on two occasions

• Valid - measures what it is supposed to 
measure

18

VALIDITY
• IQ - correlates with GPA in high school 
and college, job success, salary, stable 
marriages, staying out of jail, longevity

• 25% of variation
(personality, education, culture)

19

WHAT DO 15 IQ POINTS 
MEAN?
100 IQ - average in high school, year or 
two in community college

115 IQ - at least college, white collar

85 IQ - dropping out of high school,
skilled labor

23

WHERE ARE THE GAINS?
• WISC 10 subtests
- small gains - vocabulary, general 
knowledge, arithmetic
- large gains - similarities
“In what way are dogs and rabbits alike?”
“both mammals” (abstract/taxonomic)
“you use dogs to hunt rabbits”
(functional)

24

ABSTRACT THINKING
• Kpelle Tribe - Liberia
sort basket of food, tools, 
containers, clothing

functional pairings - potato 
and knife
how would a fool do it?
taxonomic categories

25

INTELLIGENCE TESTS
• value attached to a specific time 
and a specific test
• constant re-norming to set each 
subtest to population mean of 100
• 70 as cut-off for mental 
retardation - WISC-III comes out in 
1991, number labeled mentally 
retarded doubled 

26

MODELS OF INTELLIGENCE
• psychometric analysis of subtests
• positive correlation among subtests
• Spearman - “g” - general intelligence
“s” - specific intelligence
• Thurstone - 56 tests - 7 primary mental 
abilities (verbal, spatial, etc.)
• Cattell & Horn
fluid intelligence - novel tasks

information

Relation between birth order and IQ score. Mean IQ scores for male conscripts, first-, second-, and thirdborn in Norway to mothers with single 
births only and first birth from 1967 through 1976, according to birth order and number of elder siblings who died in infancy (age < 1 year). 
Scores are adjusted for parental education level, maternal age at birth, sibship size, birth weight, and year of conscription. Error bars show 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs). Reference: birth order one.

EARLY EXPOSURE TO 
LANGUAGE
• Hart & Risley - record each month for 2.5 years one full 
hour of every word spoken at home between parent and 
child in 42 families, categorized as professional, working 
class, or welfare families (SES) - code and analyze every 
utterance in 1,318 transcripts - 30,000 pages

Key findings
• variation in children’s IQ and language ability 
related to amount parents speak to children
• children’s academic success at ages 9-10 related 
to amount of talk heard at ages 0-3

67

EARLY EXPOSURE TO 
LANGUAGE
• by age 3, cumulative vocabulary was 1100 words in 
professional family, 750 in working class family, 500 in 
welfare family
• welfare family = 616 words/hour; working class family = 
750 words/hour; professional family = 2153 words/hour
• by age 3, vocabulary used was larger in children of 
professional parents than welfare parents
• 300 words more per hour for professional than welfare 
parents
• extrapolated to a year - child in professional family 
hears 11 million words vs. 3 million in welfare family
• strong correlation for children at age 9 in IQ

•

Affirmation: choose a value from a list and 
write an in-class essay about why the chosen 
value is important to you
Control: choose a value from the same list and 
write an in-class essay about why the chosen 
value might be important to someone else
African Americans in affirmation group had 
G.P.A.s .30 pts higher than their control 
counterparts, but no effect was seen for the 
white students in the affirmation group…
Affirmation reduced the 
achievement gap by 40%!
