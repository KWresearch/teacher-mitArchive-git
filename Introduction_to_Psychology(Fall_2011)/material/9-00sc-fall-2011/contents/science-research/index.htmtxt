***** Session Overview *****
                           How do we study particular topics in psychology? How
                           is scientific psychology different from "common
                           sense" or "folk" psychology? This session examines
                           the research methods necessary to develop and test
                           ideas, and highlights how even widely-discussed
                           scientific studies can fall short of the truth.

**** Short Essay ****
When conducting psychological research there are three main research designs
that researchers use. All three research designs can collect, analyze and
interpret data, but each have important differences. Name and describe each of
the three research designs. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of each
design. Give a research example of each design.
âº Sample Answer
The three research designs are descriptive research, correlational research,
and experimental research.
Descriptive research provides a description or snapshot of the current state of
affairs or some phenomenon in order to understand the nature of that
phenomenon. Advantages of descriptive research is that it provides a complete
picture of the situation and is often real world or events that are naturally
occurring. Disadvantages are that there is no statistical relationship, beyond
anecdotal evidence, that are studied; causal influence cannot be inferred, and
it is difficult to determine which variables are influential in the study due
to the inability to repeatedly measure all of the variables and to even know
what all of the variables are.
Correlational research tests relationship between two or more variables.
Advantages of correlational research are statistical tests to show the
relationship is unlikely to occur due to chance, the ability to make
predictions about future outcomes, and it can be used to assess real-world
events. The main disadvantage is that no causal relationship can be inferred
from the relationship of the variables.
Experimental research is used to asses the causal relationship between two or
more variables by manipulating independent variables and testing the causal
impact on a dependent variable. While it is more difficult to assess real-world
events, experimental research has all of the other advantages of correlational
research in addition to the ability for causal inference. Disadvantages are the
difficulty to manipulate important variables or many variables at one time and
the cost of conducting experiments.
