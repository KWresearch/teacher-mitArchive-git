***** Check Yourself *****
Name four ways that scientists can study the brain. Describe each of these
methods. Provide a description of a study or experiment that used one of these
methods.
âº Sample Answer
Here are four methods, selected from the eight methods discussed in the lecture
video.
Lesion or patient behavioral studies. After someone has surgery to remove part
of the patients brain there may be a lesion in a particular location. Lesions
may also occur after head injury or other trauma, such as a stroke. Lesions
prevent function in a particular brain region. Psychologists can study the
differences in behavior and cognition between people with lesions and normal
people. By analyzing these differences psychologists can infer that the part of
the brain with the lesion is involved in a particular behavior or cognitive
process.
Electroencephalography (EEG) measures the electrical activity on the scalp of a
person. This electrical activity is produced by the activity of neurons. This
allows researchers to observe rapid changes in electrical activity that is
associated with a particular cognitive process.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) uses a large magnetic field to
measure differences in blood flow across the brain. Changes in blood flow are
believed to be associated with changes in neural activity. Scientists can study
the changes in blood flow that are associated with particular cognitive
processes.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) deliver magnetic pulses to the brain to
deactivate a particular brain region. By deactivating a particular brain region
scientists can study the effects of loss of activity in that region on
particular cognitive processes.
Example study using one of these methods: Phineas Gage had an iron rod go
through his skull and into his orbitofrontal cortex. Afterwards he retained his
intelligence, but his behavior was dramatically different. He became,
irritable, rude, irresponsible and dishonest. Scientists could conclude that
this area of the brain is necessary for appropriate social behavior, emotion,
and morality. This is an example of a lesion-based study. Anther example is
studies of split brain patients.
