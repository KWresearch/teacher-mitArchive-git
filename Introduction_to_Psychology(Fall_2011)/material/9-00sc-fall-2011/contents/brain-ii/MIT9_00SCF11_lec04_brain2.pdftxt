LESIONS
Strengths
• Causal - brain area necessary
• Dramatic deficits: Phineas Gage, Tan, H.M., 
prosopagnosia
• Counterintuitive deficits: Blindsight, Category-Specific 
Deficits
• Dissociations
declarative memory (knowing that) & hippocampus 
procedural memory (knowing how) & basal ganglia

LESIONS
Limitations

• damage extensive, hard to localize, not 
systematic
• individual variability:
- case v.s. groups studies
• nearby systems likely to get injured together
• degeneration, recovery, compensation
• may offer limited views of normal brain 
functions

- Limited use

STIMULATION 
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation - TMS
- disrupts neural function
- figure-8 wire coil
- generation of magnetic field
- passes through skull; induces 
current; neurons fire
- spatial resolution: 1.0-1.5 cm2

- sensation of scalp being 
withdrawn up, loud click, muscle 
twitches

- interferes with sensations

STIMULATION
Uses of TMS
- Motor Mapping

- Suppress neural activity
- Low-frequency stim (<1 Hz)

- Enhance neural activity
- High-frequency stim (>1 Hz)
- i.e., faster picture naming with 
temporal lobe stimulation
- Possible TX of neuropsychiatric disorders
- low-freq stim in auditory cortex of 
SZs decreases auditory hallucinations

STIMULATION
TMS - strengths & limitations

Strengths
- non-invasive
- directly assesses ± critical regions 
(causal)

Limitations
- spread of activation
- mild headache
- can only go 2cm below the scalp 
(due to weakening of magnetic field)

RECORDING
EEG - Principles

- Electroencephalogram

- measures changes in 
electrical activity

- uses surface electrodes  
placed on the scalp (16-
256)
- signal requires a few 
hundred thousand
neurons to fire 
synchronously

Courtesy of University of Oregon Child and Family Center.

RECORDING
EEG vs ERP
- EEG measures OVERALL brain 
activity - not related to stimulus 
presentation

- Event-related Potentials (ERP)

- time-locked to stimulus

- averaged over trials

Images of EEG and ERP waveforms removed due 
to copyright restrictions.  See lecture video and

RECORDING
EEG/ERP – Strengths & Limitations

Strengths
- great temporal resolution (10ms)
- extremely non-invasive
- relatively inexpensive

Limitations
- poor spatial resolution
- records large population of neurons
- “where is (are) the signal generators?”
- many trials needed for averaging

RECORDING
MEG - Principles
- Magnetoencephalography 

- active neurons produce 
small magnetic fields

- uses Superconducting 
Quantum Interference 
Devices (SQUIDs) to 
detect magnetic changes

- signals are 100 million 
time smaller than the 
earth's magnetic field

RECORDING
MEG – Strength & Limitations

Strengths
- great temporal resolution (10ms, exactly like 
ERP)
- non-invasive
Limitations
- okay spatial resolution (better than ERP b/c  
magnetic signal does not get distorted going 
through skull/scalp, unlike electrical signal)
- many trials needed for averaging
- can only measure neurons parallel to the skull
- expensive ( > $1 million)

Metabolic Activity

- Neurons require energy (oxygen and glucose)

- brain area active, increased blood flow brings 
energy supplies

BRAIN FACTS

- 3 1/2 pounds

- 2% total body mass

- 20% of body’s oxygen

- loss of oxygen (10 min) causes irreversible brain 
damage

fMRI Principles

-

-
-
-

like MRI, take advantage of magnetic properties of 
molecules
HOWEVER, focus on hemoglobin
Hemoglobins are in the blood and carry O2
Hemoglobins become deoxygenated when O2 is 
absorbed
- deoxygenated hemoglobin more sensitive to 
magnetic field than oxygenated hemoglobin

RECORDING
fMRI Principles
- increased blood flow 
to active region
- hemoglobins become 
deoxygenated as 
neurons use up the 
supplies of O2 
- fMRI measures ratio 
of Oxy:Deoxy
- Blood Oxygenation 
Level Dependent 
effect (BOLD effect)

? If neurons using up oxygen, why does BOLD signal 
increase?

RECORDING
fMRI Principles

- initial dip DOES 
reflect use of oxygen
- but signal too small 
to detect

more information, see http://ocw.mit.edu/fairuse.

- later rush of blood to 
area; arteries 
overcompensates, 
providing more oxygen 
than needed - MUCH 
LARGER SIGNAL

RECORDING
fMRI - issues

Strengths
- good spatial resolution (2-3mm)
- non-invasive (no injection)
- widely available
- can be used to assess many cognitive tasks

Limitations
- poor temporal resolution (6s, better than PET, 
worse than ERP/MEG)
- expensive ($4 million, $300-$1000 per scan)
- correlational, not causal
