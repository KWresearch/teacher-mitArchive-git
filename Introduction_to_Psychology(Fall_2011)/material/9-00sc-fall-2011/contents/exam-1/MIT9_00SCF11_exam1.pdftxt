1.  In a social psychology experiment, white participants either forecasted (imagined) or actually 
experienced how they would feel and how they would behave towards a white stranger who 
made a racial slur about a black stranger.  The findings were: 
A)  both forecasters and experiencers felt negative feelings towards the white stranger and were 
less likely to select the white stranger as a partner for performing a task (relative to a control 
condition without any slur being made) 
B)  neither forecasters nor experiencers felt negative feelings towards the white stranger and 
both groups were likely to select the white stranger as a partner for performing a task 
(relative to a control condition without any slur being made) 
C)  forecasters felt negative feelings towards the white stranger and were less likely to select the 
white stranger as a partner for performing the task; experiencers felt negative feelings 
towards the white stranger but were as likely to select the white stranger as a white stranger 
in a control condition without any slur being made 
D)  forecasters felt negative feelings towards the white stranger and were less likely to select the 
white stranger as a partner for performing the task; experiencers did not have negative 
feelings towards the white stranger and were as likely to select the white stranger as a white 
stranger in a control condition without any slur being made
