An experiment had subjects either (Forecaster Group) hear about an 
individual make a racist comment or (Experiencer Group) actually be present 
when an individual made a racist comment.  Then, these subjects were asked

Book Chapter Questions: 

Professor Henry Higgins' laboratory just finished a study on music and language.  They 
asked whether there was any relationship between musical expertise and the ability to 
learn a foreign language.  In the first part of their study, participants took a test of 
musical ability, and then they learned how to say 100 words in the new language.  The 
results of this experiment are in the graph below.

_______ 21. 
Prof. Higgins asked four of his grad students to provide an explanation of 
the data.  Based on your knowledge of correlations, whose explanation do the 
data best and most accurately support? 

Name:	

        TA:


A.	 Tracy: "People who learned more words also had greater musical ability, 
therefore music and language rely on the same mental processes." 
B.	 Jean: "People who learned more words were also more likely to have 
greater musical ability, therefore we can use someone's score on the 
music test to predict how many foreign words they will learn." 
C.	 Sam: "People who learned more words also tended to have better musical 
ability, therefore having good language skills helps you be a better 
musician." 
D.	 Pat: "People who had better musical ability learned more words, therefore 
being a good at music helps you learn a foreign language." 

______ 22. 
To explore her hypothesis, Sam designed the following experiment.  Two 
_
groups of participants took the musical ability test.  Group “A” came back to the 
lab every day and practiced memorizing words.  Group “B” came back to the lab 
every day and read the same lists of words, but did not memorize them.  Then 
the two groups took the music ability test again.  Sam hypothesized that having 
to memorize the words would cause people to do better on the music test.  In 
Sam's experiment: 

A.	 Group A is the independent variable; Group B is the dependent variable. 
B.	 Group A is the dependent variable; Group A is the independent variable. 
C.	 Group A is in the experimental condition; Group B is in the control 
condition. 
D.	 Group A is in the control condition; Group B is in the experimental 
condition. 

______ 23.  When Sam looked at the data, she found that the mean music test score 
_
after training for Group A was 70.4, and the mean test score for Group B after 
training was 55.8.  Sam concludes that Group A had better musical ability after 
the experiment.  Which of the following details would be a reason for Prof. 
Higgins to be skeptical of Sam’s conclusion? 

A.	 A small number of participants in Group A had much higher scores than 
the rest of that group. 
B.	 A small number of participants in Group B had much higher scores than 
the rest of that group 
C.	 Many people in Group B had exactly the same score on the test. 
D.	 The lowest score in Group A was lower than the highest score in Group B. 

______ 24. 
Sam and Prof. Higgins are excited about the data and want to submit 
_
them to a conference.  They want to be confident the effect they have found is 
real, and that it is not due to chance.  To ensure this, Sam and Prof. Higgins 
should subject their data to: 

Name:	

        TA:


A.	 Correlational analysis 
B.	 Selective reporting 
C.	 Descriptive statistics 
D.	 Inferential statistics 

_______ 25. 
At the conference, Professor Zoltan Karpathy, another psychologist, points 
out what he claims is a serious problem with Sam’s experiment.  He notices that 
Sam always knew whether a participant was in Group A or whether they were in 
Group B.  Prof. Karpathy claims that Sam’s data might be contaminated because 
of: 

A.	 Random assignment of participants 
B.	 Participants’ response bias 
C.	 Experimenter expectancy effects 
D.	 Sam’s sampling bias 

_______ 26. 
Prof. Higgins agrees that Sam’s data might have the confound pointed out 
by Prof. Karpathy.  When they return from the conference, Prof. Higgins asks 
Sam to redo the experiment.  What must she do differently this time to avoid the 
confound Prof. Karpathy mentioned? 
A.	 Use random assignment of participants to groups 
B.	 Use a double-blind design 
C.	 Use a larger sample size 
D.	 Use a different dependent variable 

_______ 27.  Which symptom would a patient with hippocampal damage most likely 
exhibit? 
A.	 Poor working memory 
B.	
Inability to form new procedural memories 
C.	 Impaired memory of events that occurred long prior to the hippocampal 
damage

_______ 28.  Which of the following can be used to determine a causal relationship 
between brain structure and behavior? 
A.	 A brain scan of a schizophrenic man shows that the parts of the brain that 
process sensory information are significantly larger than in non-
schizophrenics 
B.	 A brain scan of a schizophrenic man shows that the parts of the brain that 
process sensory information are significantly more active than in non-
schizophrenics 
C.	 Neither A and B 
D.	 Both A or B

(Questions 47-50) use the following story:

Young Ivan has a phobia of puppies. Whenever he sees a puppy wagging its tail,

he freezes and starts crying. On the other hand, he likes chocolate-covered

strawberries. Observing his behaviors, Ivan’s mom thought of a few ways to cure

his phobia of puppies.


Mom tried putting a puppy repeatedly in front of Ivan. Every time she showed him

the puppy, Mom also showed him a chocolate-covered strawberry. After doing

that five times, Mom discovered that Ivan started crying whenever he saw a

chocolate-covered strawberry, even if the puppy was not in his sight. Choose the

appropriate answer for the following questions.

_______ 46.  What is the conditioned stimulus (CS) in this learning process? 
A.  Chocolate-covered strawberries. 
B.  Mom 
C.	 Puppies 
D.	 Crying

the strawberries. What is the process involved in this phenomenon? 
A.  Negative Reinforcement 
B.  Extinction

B.	 mom is using a behavior modification technique to change Ivan’s behavior 
C.	 the sticker is used as a secondary reinforcer

6. 	

Ivan is still afraid of puppies. Mom decided it’s important that Ivan can touch 
puppies so that he learns that they’re harmless.  She put a puppy at a distance from 
Ivan and gave him a chocolate-covered strawberry when he didn’t cry of fear. Then 
she brought the puppy a bit closer and gave him another strawberry if he didn’t cry. 
She repeated this process, bringing the puppy closer and encouraging Ivan to reach 
out his hand to the puppy. Finally Ivan could pat a puppy on its head to get a 
chocolate-covered strawberry. This is an example of ____________________ 
through ____________________________. The ability to emit this behavior in 
response to a similar stimulus, such as a kitten, is _______________. However, if 
Ivan responds only to puppies and nothing else, this ability to respond to a particular 
stimulus is called _____________________________. 

7.	 Mom wants to make sure that Ivan completely overcomes his fear of puppies. When 
Ivan reaches towards a puppy and pats it, Mom will give him a chocolate-covered 
strawberry as a reward. She thought of two ways to do this: 

Plan A is to reward him when Ivan pats the puppy every 5 times on average, but 
sometimes after 3 times and sometimes after 7 times. The reinforcement schedule 
used here is ____________________.  Plan B is to reward him for patting a puppy 
for the first time, but not give him more strawberries for the next 10 minutes 
regardless of how many times she touches the puppy. Repeat the same for the next 
10 minutes, by rewarding him on the first response during that 10-minute period. The 
reinforcement schedule used here is _________________________.  The first type 
of reinforcement schedule induces a MORE/LESS (circle one) consistent rate of 
responding than does the second type of reinforcement schedules.
