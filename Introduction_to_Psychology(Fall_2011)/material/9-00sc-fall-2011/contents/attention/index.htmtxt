***** Session Overview *****
                                       Do you ever get distracted when you are
                                       supposed to be focused? Why do we pay
                                       attention to something? How are we able
                                       to pay attention to certain things while
                                       ignoring others? Attention is present in
                                       almost all domains of human thought and
                                       feeling. During this session, we will

***** Discussion: Attention *****
Today we're also going to talk about attention. How we engage with the world,
but only a small part of it at a time. Why we can't engage with the whole
thing, and what it would be like to engage with the whole thing. Limits on our
attention: why we can't perceive everything at once.... Read_more_Â»
***** Check Yourself *****
Describe an example of selective attention. Does selective attention completely
block out all other sensory input? If not give an example. What are the
advantages and disadvantages of processes involved in selective attention?
âº Sample Answer
One example of selective attention is the ability to focus on one person
speaking in a crowd of people speaking. Selective attention does not completely
block out all other sensory input. For example, the cocktail party phenomenon
occurs when we are only attending to and aware of one person speaking. We seem
to have no attention to the surrounding conversations. However, if someone says
your name or something related to you, you quickly divert our attention to the
person that said your name. Therefore, while consciously unaware of the
surrounding sensory input, our brains are constantly monitory surrounding
input.
The advantage of selective attention is that it allows us to focus on important
elements of our environment while blocking out things that could be
distracting. This is especially important for survival in dangerous situations.
However, focusing too much on one thing could be a disadvantage if other things
in the environment require more urgent focus. The "cocktail party phenomenon"
is a process that allows us to monitor the environment while still focusing our
attention on important things.
