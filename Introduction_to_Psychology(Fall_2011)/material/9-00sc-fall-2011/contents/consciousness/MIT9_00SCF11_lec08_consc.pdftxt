Blindsight & Tectopulvinar  

Visual System


Sensation without perception 

Three subcortical retinal projections:

• pretectal area of midbrain controls 
pupillary reflexes 
• lateral geniculate nucleus & 
geniculostriate system (90%) 
• superior colliculus & tectopulvinar 
system 

What is not done by the  

geniculostriate system ? 


•	 consequence of unilateral or bilateral occipital 
lesions 
•	 Munk (1881) dogs with bilateral occipital lesions 
avoided obstacles in path that they failed to 
recognize 
•	 monkeys with complete visual cortex ablations 
recover ability to do spatial localization, orientation 
detection, very simple shape discrimination

Blindsight 


• Patient DB (Weiskrantz) – 
arteriovenous malformation in right occipital pole 
right visual cortex removed 
tested in blind region by dynamic perimetry 
LVF scotoma 
light flash, move eye toward light 
tendency to move eye toward correct spot 
reaching was more accurate 
• better than chance in LVF guesses about 
presence/absence of small patches of light, orientation of
lines 
• 97% accurate at discriminating long from short line with 
exposure as short as 100 msec 
• could discriminate circle/cross and X/O - 90% accurate 
• could not do square/rectangle discrimination

CONSCIOUS & UNCONSCIOUS  

VISION IN MONKEYS

Are monkeys with occipital lesions also "unconscious" of visual 
stimuli in blindsight? 
1 intact monkey 
3 monkeys with ablation of left striate cortex and of 
splenium of corpus callosum 

task 1 - touch position where a light comes on – blind animals 
good in both fields 

task 2- half the trials had one of five target illuminated - for blank 
trials, press large rectangle 
what happens on probe trials in blind field?  treated as blank

ATTENTION & NEGLECT 

• Neglect 
• Anosagnosia 
• Measures of Neglect 
• Brain Mechanism of Neglect 
• Neglect of Imagined Representations 

• Psychological Model of Neglect 
• Rotation of Neglect 
• Levels of Attention in Neglect 

NEGLECT

•  Failure to report, respond or orient
to a stimulus presented
contralateral to lesion that cannot 
be accounted for by elementary
sensory or motor deficits - florid 
early on - patient may deny left half 
of body, dress one side, eat from
one side of plate 
•  Extinction to double simultaneous  

stimulation - seen in late stages

Anosagnosia - be unaware of or deny 
hemiparesis, hemianopia 

Right-sided lesions; 5% of cases 

Ramachandran Studies – Patients cannot use 

left arm after stroke 
•  Can you use your right hand? 
–  Yes. 
•  Can you use your left hand? 
–  Yes. 
•  Are both hands equally strong? 
–  Yes. 
•  Can you point to my nose with your right hand? 
–  (she does) 
•  Can you point to my nose with your left hand? 
–  (paralyzed hand does not move) 
•  Are you pointing to my nose? 
–  Yes. 
•  Can you clearly see it pointing? 
–  Yes, it is about two inches from your nose. 
•  Can you clap? 
–  Of course I can clap (right hand alone moves). 
•  Are you clapping? 
–  Yes I am clapping. 

rationalization - arthritis 

$5 - screw in light bulb 
$10 - tie shoelaces 

tray of cocktail glasses filled with water -
ask patient to hold tray - does so with 
right hand - tray tumbles 

Syringe with ice cold water - irrigated left 
ear canal - patient's eyes started to 
move -
•  Do you feel ok? 
– My ear is very cold, but other than that I
am fine. 

Syringe with ice cold water - irrigated left ear 
canal - patient's eyes started to move -
•	 Do you feel ok? 
– My ear is very cold, but other than that I am
fine. 
•	 Can you use your hands? 
–  I can use my right arm, but not my left arm.  I want 
to move it, but it doesn't move. 
•	 Whose arm is this? (holding paralyzed arm) 
–	 It is mine, of course. 
•	 Can you use it? 
–	 No, it is paralyzed. 
•	 How long has your arm been paralyzed?  Did it start 
just now or earlier? 
–	 It's been paralyzed for several days now. 
90 minutes later - back to anosagnosia 

Measures of neglect 
a. writing in RVF 
b. reading in RVF 
c. drawing clock, copying scenes 
• drawing clock may be better if subject does not 
see drawing 
d. cancellation or search tasks 
e. line bisection 
• improved if subject is asked to read letter at 
neglected end - letter read ok if a single 
letter at left end 
• left-end letter often missed if letters at each end 
• greatest when letter at right end 
• improved by varying starting position of hand

• Bisiach, Luzzati, & Perani (1979)

–  two sequentially seen stimuli - same or different? 
–  patients with left-sided neglect made more errors 
when stimuli differed on left side

Patient Performance 
Parietal Stroke 

• major deficit in responding to invalid cues on 
contralesional side 
• mild deficit to cued contralateral stimuli indicates  

that subjects can engage contralateral stimuli

• similar RT patterns to cued stimuli indicates that 
patients could move attention 
• problem is one of disengagment from invalid,
ipsilateral location
