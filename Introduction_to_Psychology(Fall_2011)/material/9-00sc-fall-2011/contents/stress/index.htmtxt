***** Session Overview *****
                                      What stresses you out? What is stress and
                                      how does it affect our body? In this
                                      lecture, we will examine stress, the
                                      neural substrates of stress, and the ways
                                      in which stress manifests itself
                                      physically and emotionally.

***** Discussion: Stress *****
So, let's talk a little bit about the science of stress, the psychology of
stress, and the physiology of stress. What's going on when you say, "I'm
stressed out" â what does that mean from a biological and a cognitive
perspective?â¦ Read_more_Â»
***** Check Yourself *****
Describe the three stages of Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome.
âº Sample answer
The general adaptation syndrome is comprised of three stages: alarm,
resistance, and exhaustion. In the alarm phase, an organism prepares
physiologically and psychologically to respond to a stressor. This includes the
release of hormones like cortisol and the activation of the HPA axis. In the
resistance phase, the organism mobilizes resources to adapt to the contiued
presence of a stressor. This may include reducing non-essential metabolic
activities in preference for those that support the stress response. Cortisol
levels remain high during this phase if the stressor is chronic. In the
exhaustion phase, the physiological cost of maintaining a heightened response
to the stressor begins to take its toll. Resources may be diverted away from
essential systems (cf. resistance phase) which cause damage to the body and
brain.
Â 
What is hostility in the context of psychological science? What are some of the
effects of hostility on health?
âº Sample answer
Hostility is a "personality trait associated with heart disease and
characterized mistrust, an expectation of harm and provocation by others, and a
cynical attitude." Hostile personality traits are present in individuals with a
so-called "Type A personality." The heightened, chronic stress responses
associated with hostility include high blood pressure and heart disease.
Â 
Coping strategies for handling stress can be either problem-focused or emotion-
focused. Explain how these two approaches are different and similar. Identify
general strategies that are examples of problem-focused coping and emotion-
focused coping.
âº Sample answer
Problem-focused coping strategies are those that seek to change the external
source of a stressor. This can include changing the environment itself, or
changing how one interacts with the environment to avoid causing stress.
Examples of general approaches to problem-focused coping include active coping
(trying to remove or work around a stressor), planning (developing strategies
for managing a stressor), and instrumental social support (seeking advice about
specific actions from others), among others.
Emotion-focused coping strategies, meanwhile, are those that seek to change the
internal response to a stressor. Rather than trying to reduce or remove the
cause of stress, these strategies attempt to change the emotional response to
the stressor â how it is experienced by an individual. Emotion-focused coping
strategies include emotional social support (seeking affirmation and
encouragement from others), venting emotions (talking about stressed feelings
to others as a means to feeling better), and mental disengagement (trying to
think about other, non-stressful things), among others.
Both emotion- and problem-focused approaches are viable methods for reducing
stress.
