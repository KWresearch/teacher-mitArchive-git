STRESS
What stresses a zebra?
(Robert Saplosky, Why Zebras Don’t Get 
Ulcers)

STRESS
What stresses a zebra?

serious physical injury 
predators (lions)
starvation

STRESS
• psychological and physiological response to 
a stimulus (stressor) that alters the body’s 
equilibrium

STRESS
Chronic
Acute
hunger, cancer
injury

Physical

Psychological deadline

chronic work 
pressure

Social

humiliation

chronic isolation

STRESS
• for animals, stress is often acute, physical, 
responsive
• for people in industrial society, stress is often 
chronic, psychosocial, anticipatory

Neurobiological 
Substrates of Dread
• Berns 2006, Science
• fMRI and waiting for a cutaneous electrical 
shock to foot
• each trial starts with information about voltage 
level and amount of time
• at first 100% of trials had voltage
• choice phase, e.g., 90% voltage in 3 secs or 
60% voltage in 27 secs
• some people prefer more voltage now than to 
wait for shock (extreme dreaders)

More Voltage (Pain) Associated with Greater Brain Activation

STRESS
• Hans Selye - 1930s - insightful scientists, not so 
good at handling rats

Colleague extracted ovarian chemical - what 
does it do? - Selye injected rats daily -
dropped them, ran around - several months 
later - peptic ulcers, enlarged adrenal glands, 
shrunken immune tissue - also in control rats
- exposed rats to many stressors, all had the 
same result 

STRESS
•The Stress Response is similar to a broad array 
of stressors

• if stressors go on for too long, they make you 
sick

STRESS & 
AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM
• Sympathetic nervous system
• brain to spine, organs, blood vessels, 
sweat glands, muscles and hairs 
(goosebumps)
• emergency, arousal, activation
• four Fs - flight, fright, fight, and sex
• releases epinephrine/norepinephrine
(adrenaline/noradrenaline)
•Parasympathetic nervous system
sleep, eating, relaxation

STRESS & AUTONOMIC 
NERVOUS SYSTEM
Parasympathetic
Sympathetic
slows down
speeds up
to muscles
from muscles

Heart
Blood

STRESS & HORMONES

• hypothalamus
releases CRH (corticotropin releasing 
hormone) to anterior pituitary
• anterior pituitary (15 sec)
releases adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH) into blood
• adrenal glands (kidney) (few minutes)
release glucocorticoids (steroids) (cortisol)

• Increase heart rate
• Increase blood pressure to muscle 
(and brain) away from digestive 
system 
• Decrease kidney function to keep 
water
• Void the bladder

• Stress-induced hypertension
• Ventricular hypertrophy
– (top predictor of cardiac arrest 
controlling for age)
• Damage to arteries
– Plaque formation
– Damaged inflamed blood vessels

• Ulcer – hole in the wall of an 
organ
• Peptic (gastric, 
esophageal,duodenal)
– Robert Warren/Barry 
Marshall/2005 Nobel
• – 1983
– Bacterium – heliobacter
pylori swallowed/gastritis

– But 15% of cases unrelated 
– And only 10% with 
bacterium get ulcers

The Stress Response
and its Consequences
Adaptive Stress-Response Stress-related Disorder

• Suppression of growth

• Psychogenic dwarfism

• British Victorian family
• favorite son killed at 13
• Bereaved mother takes to bed
– ignores 6 year-old son
• “David is that you? Oh, it is only 
you.”
• David was perfect
• 5ft as an adult
• J.M. Barrie writes Peter Pan

POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS 
DISORDER (PTSD)

• a severe anxiety disorder that can 
develop after exposure to any 
event which results in psychological 
trauma
• re-experience original trauma 
through flashbacks and dreams, 
increased arousal, hypervigilance
• assault/rape, combat
• sustained in about 20% of people

military service and stressful events
• increase in stress associated with greater 
amygdala and hippocampus response to 
stress-relate content
• amygdala reactivity before stress

Psychological Modifiers
of the Stress Response

• Outlets for frustration
• Sense of predictability and of control
• A perception of life improving
• Social support

(Weiss, Levine, Sehgman)

Psychological Modifiers
of the Stress Response
• Outlets for frustration (Jay Weiss)
rats receive mild shocks
prolonged stress response - heart rate up,
glucocorticoid secretion up, ulcers
other rats can gnaw on wooden bar, or eat, or drink, 
or run on wheel - fewer ulcers
or run to another rate and bite it
baboons attack bystanders after losing a fight

Psychological Modifiers
of the Stress Response
•Sense of predictability and of control
• rats hear warning bell before shock - fewer ulcers -
predictability (vs. unknown)
• food delivered to rat at intermittent intervals vs. 
random delivery of equal food - glucocorticoid levels 
go up
• rat given lever to avoid shocks - even if lever is 
disconnected to shocks, stress response is reduced
• people - noxious noises – one person has button to 
press to stop noise - less hypertensive whether button 
is pressed or not
• occupational stress - high demand & low control

Psychological Modifiers
of the Stress Response
• Sense of predictability and of control
Rodin & Langer, 1977
• nursing home
group A – make decisions for yourself
where to receive visitors
when to watch movie
what houseplant to take care of
group B – no instructions to make decisions
got plant, but staff took care of plant

1.5 years later – group A more cheerful, active, and 
alert, healthier, half as many had died

Psychological Modifiers
of the Stress Response
• Sense of predictability and of control
Cultural Influences
Individualist – US/Europe
Collectivist – East Asian (and rest of the world?)
Elementary school 7-9 year olds, Asian-American or 
Anglo-American – Ms. Smith – six markers (6 colors) –
six piles of anagrams (family, animal, etc. RIBD) 
Random assignment to 3 groups
- you choose, teacher chooses, mother chooses
- Anglo-Americans self = 4X Ms Smith, 2.5X mother
- Asian-Americans - 30% more for mother than self, 
2X than Ms Smith 

Psychological Modifiers
of the Stress Response
• Sense of predictability and of control

life and death struggle

Richter, 1957
Water temperature and endurance
Rats in a jar – how long does rat swim before drowning?
15 minutes-60 hours before giving up, much variation

Picked up rats, let them wriggle free, in and out of 
water, 
Average of 60 hours of effort

Psychological Modifiers
of the Stress Response
• Social support
• Primates - after stress response, among strangers -
worse; among friends - better (measured by 
glucocorticoids)
• People - stressor (public speaking, math task, 
argument with strangers) - less cardio-vascular 
response with a supportive friend present
• Observations - people with spouses/close friends 
live longer; when spouse dies, risk of dying 
increases; parents of children killed in war have 
higher risk of disease/mortality only if 
divorced/widowed; patients with severe coronary 
disease had 3x death rate over 5 years if lacking 
social support

Psychological Modifiers
of the Stress Response
• A perception of life improving (worsening)
• rats/shocks - rat #1 - 10/hr; rat #2 - 50/hr;
Day 2 - all rats get 25/hr; 10-25 becomes 
hypertensive

(Weiss, Levine, Sehgman)

Risk of Ulcer

Shock alone

+ another rat

+ wood bar

+ warning signal

+ lever

50 (cid:198) 25 shocks

+ friends

Embodied Cognition

• the nature of the human mind largely 
determined by the form of the human body
• ideas, thoughts, concepts, categories 
shaped by aspects of the body
• is emotional pain (social, romantic 
rejection) built out of physical pain?

Pain
sensory - objective
affective - subjective (suffering, 
unpleasantness)

Social Pain

Methodology and results from an 
fMRI study of social exclusion. (a)
Example of what participants viewed 
while in the scanner. Participants 
were included in the ball-tossing 
game during one round and 
excluded during another. (b)
Participants showed increased 
dorsal anterior cingulate cortex 
(dACC) activity during the exclusion 
compared with the inclusion 
episode. (c) Participants' levels of 
self-reported distress correlated 
highly with dACC activity during the 
exclusion episode compared with 
the inclusion episode.

Romantic Pain
• Physical pain (heat)
• Romantic pain/social rejection
• Participants “felt intensely rejected as a 
result of recently experiencing an 
unwanted romantic relationship break-
up”
• Viewed pictures of ex-partners and 
thought about being rejected (vs. viewing 
pictures of friends and thinking about 
positive experiences

- provide daily reports
- by Day 15, less painful resposne to

- less brain response to social rejection
