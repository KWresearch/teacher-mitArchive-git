KOSSLYN CHAPTER 10 – Stress, Health, and Coping: Dealing With Life 
HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY: the area of psycho logy concerned w ith the promotion of health and the
prevention and treatment of illness as it relates to psycho logical factors 
•  STRESS: general term describing the psycho logical and physical response to a stimulus that
alters the body’s equilibrium
Stressor: a stimulus that throws the body’s equilibrium out of balance ; our perception of a stimulus
determines whether  it will elicit the stress response, not necessarily the objective nature of the 
stimulus itse lf 
•	 Physical 
•	 Psychological 
Social 
•	
•	 Acute (short-term duration) 
•  Chronic (long-term duration) 
Stress Response : (aka fight-or-flight response) the bodily response to a stressor that occur to help a 
person cope with a stressor; works to re-establish  homeostasis  
Stress(ors)  not  always a bad thing; can lead to positive change  and growth 
The Biology of Stress
Hans Selye  the body responds to  stressors in generally predictable ways 
•	 General adaptation syndrome: the overall stress response 
3 distinct phases
1.	 Alarm Phase –  triggered by perception of a stressor ; characterized by the fight-or-flight

response ; body mobilizes to fight or flee from stressor in a cascade of events:

•	 Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis): 
Initiates release of glucocort icoids (i.e .: cortisol  increases production of energy 
a.	
from glucose; anti-inflammatory; affects neurotransmitter functioning; can affect
cognition, emotion; increased alertness, can put emotions aside when confronted
by acute , severe stressor) 
b. 	 Activates sympathet ic nervous system (inhibits parasympathetic nervous system) 
Sympathetic nervous system in turn releases certain neurotransmitters, hormones (ex:
•	
epinephrine, norepinephrine) 
•	 Epinephrine and norepinephrine cause changes in the body that make strenuous physical
activity easier (ex: affect heart rate to pump more blood to muscles; affect breathing to put
more oxygen in blood; cause pupils to dilate to allow more light to enter for better vision;
cause pa lms to sweat slightly for better gripping; also affects immune functioning) 
•	 Changes that sharpen the senses, improve some qualit ies of memory, make it easier to
respond to stress. Sometimes, stress responses can be distract ing and can actua lly interfere
with successful coping in many situations. 
2.	 Resistance Phase –  aka adaptation phase; body mobilizes its resources to adapt to the continued
presence of the stressor 
•	 Disrupts bodily functions (ex: digestion, growth, sex drive , reproductive processes) 
•	 No new energy is stored (if under chronic stress, this can lead to  fatigue) 
•	 Cortiso l helps the body return to a more normal state in the presence of a cont inued
stressor (peak 20 – 40 mins after onset  of acute  stressor; return to norma l 1 hr  after stressor 
is gone)  with continued stress, cortiso l may not  return to baseline 
3.	 Exhaustion Phase – aka damage phase; continued stress response  itself becomes damaging to 
the body 
•	 Body’s limited resources for dealing w ith stress are depleted 
•	 Rather than producing exhaustion, continued stress begins to damage the body 
increased risk of stress-re lated diseases 
•	 Damage to / decreased number of hippocampal cells, amount of branching of dendrites 
Impa irs learning, memory

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 10 – Stress, Health, and Coping: Dealing With Life 

Allostasis –  multiple  bio logical changes that a llow  you to adapt to  a stressor  or a  set  of stressors in the 
short run, so your body functions within a comfortable range
Allostatic load –  cumulative  wear and tear  from allostasis 
As number / intensity of stressors rises, so does a llostatic load  increased risk of medica l / 
psycho logical problems. 
Psychological, socia l stressors –  subjective , varying nature

Physical stressors – objectively defined; but  perception can determine whether it  is a stressor!

Cognitive Appraisal – 2  stage  process  that  leads  psychologica l  and  socia l  (and  sometimes  physica l)

stimuli to function as stressors

1.	 Primary appraisal –  assess stimuli for like lihood of danger  [Am I in danger?] 
2.	 Secondary appraisal – determine resources available to deal with stimulus [What can I do about 
it?] 
•  Coping: taking action to  address a stressor or  counteract its effects 
Depending on your cognit ive appraisal of a stimulus, you will experience different emot ion and your
body will react in different ways.
When your cognitive appraisa l leads you to conclude that a stimulus is a threat , you’re likely to have 
negative emotions (which you must, in turn, address). 
Perceived Control 
Perception of whether you can control a st imulus determines whether it functions as a stressor .

Perceived lack of control  onset  of learned helplessness, depression

Stress a lso arises because an aversive event is unpredictable .

SOURCES OF STRESS 
1.  Internal Conflict: emot ional predicament people experience when making difficult choices 
a.	 3 types
i.  Approach-approach  conflict:  competing alternatives are equa lly positive 
ii.	 Avoidance-avoidance  conflict:  competing alterna tives are equally unpleasant 
iii.	 Approach-avoidance  conflict: a course of action has both positive and negative 
aspects, produces both approach and avo idance 
2.	 Daily hassles (i.e .: the  “little  things,” ongo ing concerns that add up to increase a llostat ic load
and create stress; psycho logical problems; physica l symptoms; immune problems; higher
cholesterol levels 
Ex: interruptions to a da ily routine 

STRESS, DISEASE, AND SLEEP 
Too strong a stress response for too long a time – too great a  chronic allostatic load –  can lead to 
stress-related illness. 
The Immune System
Stress adversely affects the immune system, which functions to defend the body aga inst infection 
•	 B Cells: white blood cell that matures in the bone marrow 
•	 T Cells: white blood cell that matures in the thymus 
o	 Natural Killer cell : a type  of T ce ll that  detects and destroys damaged / altered cells
(ex: precancerous cells) 
Glucocortico ids, released when the stress response is triggered, hinder the formation of  NK  cells  and  
other types of white blood cells, making the body more vulnerable to infection and tumor growth.
Many studies invest igating the relationship between stress and the immune system measure the
number of circulat ing white blood ce lls, ex: NK cells

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 10 – Stress, Health, and Coping: Dealing With Life 
People who exhibit greater sympathet ic nervous system responses to stress also show the most
changes in immune system funct ioning; indicates that changes in the immune system are moderated
by changes in the sympathetic nervous system
Psychoneuroimmunology –  focuses on the ways in which mental and emotional states affect  the 
immune system 
•  Sick, elderly people wait until after holidays to die – importance  of holidays leads bra in to
boost immune system to fight off ailment , but after ho liday, motivation  and  w ill  to  live  
decrease, and illness (along with stress of living w ith it) takes its toll on immune system
Because stress can impair the functioning of the white blood cells, it can play a ro le in the  length of
time it takes a wound to hea l. 
•	 The wounds of women who experience a high level of stress by caring for a relat ive with 
Alzheimer’s disease took 9 days longer to heal than those of women of similar age and
economic status who were not engaged in such caregiving 
•  Dental students  wounds heal faster during summer than before exam during schoo l-year
Traumatic stressors (not just daily stressors) also affect immune system, but it perception of the
severity of the stressor (not objective characterist ics) that determines the body’s response. 
•	 Hurricane Andrew – people who perceived the ir losses to be more severe had fewer  NK cells 
Cancer 
Stress doesn’t cause cancer, but the effect of stress on the immune system can affect the growth of
some cancerous tumors. 
If the immune system is suppressed by stress, NK cells do not work as well to prevent the 
•	
spread of tumor cells 
•	 Lower  levels of NK cell act ivity were  found in people who perceived that they didn’t have
enough social support / felt distressed, fatigued, little joy  weakened immune  system 
more vulnerable to cancerous tumors 
The type of cancer, and bio logical factors related to the progression of the disease, can outweigh
psycho logical factors in tumor growth.
Some people may just be genetically endowed with an immune system that is more effective  at  
warding off illness 
Heart Disease 
By inducing the  flight-or-fight response, chronic stress can increase blood pressure , which in turn 
promotes atherosclerosis (the buildup of plaque / fatty deposits of cho lesterol on the inside wa lls of 
the arteries)
Increased blood pressure  pounding on artery walls  damages wall  body tries to  repair damage 
 plaques accumulate and harden at damaged spots  hardened arteries  accumulating plaques 
cause arteries to narrow  heart must work harder to meet body’s need for nutrients, oxygen 
pumping more blood w ith more power  rinse and repeat  heart damage / sudden death from
inadequate blood supply to the heart muscle / irregular electrical firing of the muscle ,
preventing coordinated heartbeats
When a person who has atherosclerosis experiences a strong stressor, the body’s response may cause
a piece of plaque to break off, which can block an artery, preventing / limiting blood flow to an organ 
 heart attack (in the brain, this would be a stroke)  sudden death 
People with a history of heart disease or an overly responsive HPA axis are more vulnerable to (even 
relative ly small amounts of) stress. 
Heart disease is more like ly to arise when stress is accompanied by negative emotions. Negative
emotions can produce a rise in heart rate that lasts longer. When the stressors are chronic, they an
lead to helplessness, depression, and despa ir.
Depression increases the likelihood of heart disease 
•	 Depressed people have faster heartbeats even when at rest 
If the depression is treated, the stress-related responses subside .

Anxiety, fear a lso associated w ith heart disease: 
•	 Cause people to cope by engaging in unhealthy behaviors (i.e.: smoking, drinking) 
•	 Bio logical changes that arise with chronic anxiety, fear affect the heart, circulatory system 
adverse ly. 
Some people seem to experience stress more than others, regardless of their environment,

circumstances.

Hostility: persona lity trait associated with heart disease and characterized by mistrust, an expectation

of harm and provocation by others, and a cynica l attitude 

•	 Men hostility > Women hostility 
•	 Men blood pressure is more a ffected by the ir host ility. 
•	 Can be treated 
People can counter the effects of stress on heart disease by changing their lifestyle (diet, exercise, 
stress management techniques like meditation, social support). 
Sleep – the naturally recurrent experience during which normal consciousness is suspended 
5 Stages that  cycle throughout the night  (people  spend different  amounts of time  in each stage): 
STAGE 1: hypnogogic sleep ~ 5 minutes; marks transit ion from relaxed wakefulness to sleep; 
•	
sensation of gentle falling or floating / sudden jerking of body (hypnic jerk) 
o	 Breathing becomes deeper, more regular 
o	 EEG registers brain waves that are less regular, lower amplitude 
o	 Can be awakened very easily; when awakened, it didn’t fee l like you were sleeping 
STAGE 2: ~ 20 minutesEEG records sleep spindles (brief bursts of brain activity), single high-
amplitude waves 
o	 Less responsive to environment ,  st ill  easy  for  others  to  wake  you  
STAGES 3 + 4 : slow-wave sleep – bra in produces delta waves  (slow, high-amplitude waves on 
EEG)  Stage  3: 20-50% delta waves; Stage 4 : >50% delta waves 
o	 Heart rate, body temperature decrease ; not easily awakened 
•  REM SLEEP: rapid eye movements, bra in activity is similar  to when you’re awake; dreams 
o	 Breathing, heart rate are  fast , irregular ; muscles re laxed, unresponsive

With age, the pattern of your sleep stages changes and you sleep less. 
Infants: 13-15 hrs/night; more REM sleep 
•	
40 yrs: amount of deep, slow-wave sleep decreases; sha llower sleep; more easily awakened; 
•	
sleep is less satisfying 
Sleep Deprivation  adversely affects ability to  cope w ith stressors; can be a  stressor  itse lf! 
•	 REM rebound: higher percentage of REM  sleep that occurs following  a night  lacking the 
normal amount of REM 
o	 REM deprivation comes from not getting enough sleep, drinking alcohol, taking
certain sleep medications 
o	
Some people drink to specifically prevent REM sleep... BAD . 
•	 People who sleep <6 hrs each weekday night are  more likely to report be ing impat ient ,
aggravated when faced with common minor frustrations (ex: traffic, waiting in line) and are
more dissatisfied with life in genera l. 
•	 Attention declines, motor response / performance suffers 
•	 Learning disrupted: chronically increased cortisol  levels cause memory deficits; REM and 
slow-wave sleep facilitate learning information that was encountered during the day 
•  Perception of more stressors  chronic stressors  decreased immune funct ioning, diabetes… 
All of these effects  of  sleep  deprivation  cause  more  sleep  deprivation  because  they  make  you  too
keyed up to go to sleep promptly. 
All-nighters  interfere  with certain types of learning (ex: making perceptual discriminations); 
hallucinations, anxiety, parano ia, feelings of losing control / going crazy; altered normal daily
patterns of changes in body temperature, metabo lism, hormone secretions 
Function of S leep 
•	 Conserves Energy –  no  evidence to  support  this claim 
•	 Restores the Body – sleep helps the body repair the wear and tear from the day’s events; reduces
bodily effects of stressors; support from sleep deprivat ion studies 
Facilitates Learning 
•	
Why do we dream?? 
Freud: fulfillment of wishes / unconscious desires 
•	
o	 Manifest content: obvious, memorable content of a dream 
o	 Latent content: symbolic content, meaning of a  dream; might reflect sexual /
aggressive themes associated w ith an inner conflict 
•	 Activation-synthesis hypothesis: dreams arise from random bursts of nerve cell act ivity that 
may affect brain cells involved in hearing and seeing; the brain attempts to make sense of this
hodgepodge of stimuli, resulting in the experience of dreams (might explain why dreams are
so strange?) 
•	 Editing versus strengthening neural connections (true of sleep, but maybe not of dreams?) 
•	 Goals / Desires and Arousa l / Inhibition - dreams stopped completely if a patient had
damage that disconnected parts of the  fronta l cortex from the brainstem and limbic system – 
brain areas involved in curiosity, interest, a lert involvement with goals in the world; dreaming
occurs in response to any type of arousa l that act ivates brain structures invo lved in motivation 
Circadian Rhythms –  the  body’s da ily fluctuations in response  to the cycle of dark and light, occur
with blood pressure, pulse rate , body temperature , blood sugar leve l, hormone  levels, metabo lism 
Regulated by suprachiasmatic nucleus  (small part of hypothalamus above  optic chiasm)
Photoreceptors in the retina, a llows SCN to register changes in light, which lead it to produce
hormones that  set the body’s clock and regulate various bodily functions
If you are forced to work aga inst your rhythm , you w ill develop a bad mood.

People differ in the ir circadian rhythms, which means that performing in the morning can be stressful
for some people but not others, vice versa. 
•	 Larks: morning people ; experience peak body temperature , alertness, efficiency in morning 
•	 Ow ls: evening people; peak at night 
•	 Most people have a late-afternoon dip in energy level, attention 
Troubled Sleep 
Insomnia: repeated difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, or waking up too early 
• 
o	 Treatment: 
Sleeping pills  suppresses REM  sleep; addictive; when stopped, results in

unpleasant REM rebound) 
 Benzodiazepines (ex: Valium)  not as many bad effects as sleeping  pills,  but  
still addictive 
 Nonbenzodiazepines (ex: Ambien)  to lerance from regular use; sleepwalking; 
when stopped, results in serious withdrawal symptoms (ex: seizures),
unpleasant REM rebound 
Psychological  genera lly more effective than medication;  no  adverse  side  
effects 
•	 Restrict sleeping hours to same night ly pattern 
•	 Contro l bedt ime stimuli so that your bed is associated only w ith
sleeping (not reading, watching TV, etc.) 
•	 Avoid substances that interfere with sleep (ex: smoking, choco late,
alcoho l / caffeine at night, drinking lots of liquids so that you constant ly
have to go to the bathroom) 
•	 Meditation / re laxation techniques 
Sleep apnea – temporary cessation of breathing during sleep for up to 70  seconds (muscles at base of 
throat relax so that  they  don’t  keep  the  airway  open),  following  a  period  of  difficult  breathing
accompanied by deep snoring; the sleeper then startles into a lighter state of sleep, may have no
memory of these events and may not feel rested after sleeping 
•	 Can lead to heart disease, high blood pressure, poor mood, poor memory 
•	 Treatment: CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure); surgery to shave off tissue in throat
obstructing airflow; weight loss (if obese) 



STRATEGIES FOR COPING: specific approach, technique employed to handle stress 
Problem-focused  coping: changing the environment itself / the way the person interacts with the
environment; your actions can decrease stressors; effective for contro llable factors 
•	 Active coping: active ly tying to remove / work around stressor / ameliorate its effects 
•	 Planning: thinking about how to manage stressor 
Instrumental social support: seeking concrete advice, assistance, information 
•	
Suppression of competing activities: putting other activities on ho ld in order to concentrate  on 
•	
/ cope  with stressor 
•  Restraint coping: waiting to act unt il the appropriate time
Emotion-focused  coping: changing the person’s emotiona l response  to the stressor 
•	 Emot iona l social support : seeking encouragement, moral support, sympathy, understanding
from others 
•	 Venting emotions: focusing on / ta lking about distressing feelings 
•	 Posit ive reinterpretation / growth: reinterpret ing the stressor / situat ion in a positive way or
as a challenge 
•	 Behavioral disengagement: reducing efforts to deal with the stressor 
•	 Mental disengagement: turning to other activit ies to distract attent ion from the stressor

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 10 – Stress, Health, and Coping: Dealing With Life 
Allostatic load a ffects type of coping strategy you will use.
More stressors  emotion-focused coping 
Thought suppression: intentionally trying not to think about something emotionally arousing / 
distressing
Rebound effect: trying not  to think about something causes the  suppressed thought  to pop into
consciousness more than it does when you are not trying to suppress it (occurs under high allostatic
load) 
Aggression: behavior that is intended to harm another living being who does not w ish to be harmed 
•	 Hostile Attribution Bias –  tendency to  misread the intentions of others as negative 
•	 Narcissism / self-esteem – most aggressors are people who thinking exceedingly well of 
themse lves (high self-esteem) and experience an insult as a threat to their positive self-view 
o	 Agressors w ith high-self esteem = narcissists (positive view of themselves is
overinflated, doesn’t correspond to reality, unstable) 
 Men are more narcissistic than women 
•	 Gender differences  males > females when the act will physically harm another, backfire , 
cause guilt / shame 
•	 Adverse “background no ise” (can be external, i.e .: noise, heat / internal i.e .: depression, pa in)
that increases allostatic load to the po int where an individual lashes out aggressively
We have all acted on aggression –  a result  of difficulty in self-control?? 
Drugs and Alcohol
Drugs and alcohol as ways to cope are a form of mental disengagement that eventua lly becomes
maladaptive and problemat ic. Substance use changes the perception of the stressor / react ion to the
stressor while someone is under the influence of the substance, but does not change the stressor itse lf
or provide lasting changes. 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) – a  set  of guidelines for  when 
substance use crosses the line into substance abuse: 
1.	 Substance use leads to significant distress / difficulty functioning in major areas of life . 
2.	 Substance use occurs in dangerous situations.  
3.	 Substance use leads to lega l difficulties. 
Chronic substance abuse can lead to substance dependence : characterized by at  least  3 out of 7 
symptoms:
1.	 Tolerance : condition of requiring more of a substance to  achieve the same  effect , because the 
usual amount provides a diminished response 
2.	 Withdrawal: onset  of uncomfortable / life-threatening  effects  when  the  use  of  a  substance  is  
stopped 
3.	 Larger amounts of substance taken over a  longer period of time than intended 
4.	 Unsuccessful efforts / persistent desire to decrease / control the substance use 
5.	 Much t ime spent in obta ining the substance, using it, or recovering from its effects 
Important work, socia l, or recreationa l activities given up as a result of the substance 
6.	
7.	 Despite know ledge of recurrent or ongo ing physical or psychologica l problems caused or
exacerbated by the substance, cont inued use of substance 
Depressants (aka sedative-hypnotic drugs): (inc: barbiturates, benzodiazepines, a lcohol) that depress the
central nervous system, thereby decreasing the user’s behavioral activity and leve l of awareness 
•	 Disinhibition: inhibition of inhibitory neurons, which makes other neurons (the  ones that are
usually inhibited) more  likely to fire and which usually occurs as a result of depressant use.

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 10 – Stress, Health, and Coping: Dealing With Life 
Psychological Effects of Alcoho l: 
•	 Low doses: decreased awareness, increased relaxa tion, become more ta lkative / outgoing 
•	 Moderate doses: slows reaction time, impairs judgment, impairs motor coordination 
•	 High doses: impairs cognition, self-contro l, self-restraint , emotionally  unstable ,  overly

aggressive

•	 Very high doses: diminished sense of cold, pain, discomfort; dilat ion of peripheral blood
vessels to  increase the amount of blood circulating so the drinker  loses heat faster 
hypothermia , respiratory arrest, coma, death 
•	 Chronic Abuse : more ma les than females are a lcoholics; causes addit iona l stressors that must
be coped w ith; difficulties with abstract reasoning, problem solving, visual motor tasks;
blackouts: period of time  for  which an a lcoholic has no  memory of events that transpired 
while s/he was intoxicated 
Alcohol myopia: disproportionate influence of immediate experience on behavior and emotion due
to the effects of alcohol use 
•	 Alcohol impairs attention so that the drinker is less likely to not ice many cues  in  the  

environment (ex: tone of voice).

•	 After drinking alcoho l, people are slower to make  sense of the cues they do pay attent ion to. 
•	 Can lead to aggressive behavior from misreading a situation (ex: barroom brawl) 
•	 Date rape – Johnson et  al. (2002): alcohol impa irs men’s ability to understand that the
friendliness the woman showed did not mean that it was acceptable for a man to force her to
have ex. 
Stimulants: excite the nervous system  increases in behavioral activity and heightened arousal 
Cocaine: powerful stimulant that enhances a user’s sense of physica l and mental capacity while at the
same time reducing his/her appetite 
•	 Chronic use  tolerance ; w ithdrawa l (paranoia, teeth grinding, repetitive behaviors); visual
disturbances; sensory disturbances  (ex:  feeling  like  ants  are  crawling  on  your  skin)  resulting
from spontaneous firing of sensory neurons 
Inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine – these neurotransmitters are  not 
reabsorbed into the sending neuron and remain in the synaptic cleft  pleasurable, even 
euphoric, feeling 
•	 Continued use  cocaine activates reward system  in bra in, leading other sources of pleasure
to have little / no effect 
•	 When coca ine and alcohol are taken together, the liver creates cocaethylene, which intensifies 
cocaine’s effects while at the same time increases the risk of sudden death. 
Crack: cocaine  in crystalline form, usua lly smoked in a pipe or  rolled into a  cigarette 
Feeling of euphoria, perce ived clarity of thought, increased energy 
•	
•	 Use quickly leads to  abuse, dependence 
Faster acting, more intense effects, doesn’t last as long as powdered coca ine , so users tend to
•	
need more crack 
Increases heart rate, blood pressure; constricts blood vessels  sudden death, massive crash 
• 
Amphetamines: (ex: Benzedrine , Dexedrine), synthetic stimulants taken as pills or injected 
•	 High doses  amphetamine psychosis (similar  to schizophrenia –  delusions, hallucinations, 
paranoia); long-term neural changes that produce impa ired memory and motor coordination, 
associated with violent behaviors 
MDMA (aka ecstasy): synthetic stimulant, causes serotonin to be released form certain neurons and
damages these neurons  impaired memory, learning, sleep, appetite 
Caffeine, Nicotine : legal stimulants; increased alertness, ra ised pulse , heart rate ; insomnia, 
restlessness, ringing in the ears 
•	 Chronic use of caffeine  tolerance, withdrawa l headaches 
•	 Chronic use of nicotine  irritability, increased blood pressure, stomach pa ins, dizziness,
emphysema, heart disease, addict ion

Narcotic Analgesics: strongly addictive drugs tha t relieve pain and dull the senses; lessen diarrhea ; 

protracted coughing, troubled sleep  

Ex: hero in, morphine, codeine , Percodan, Demerol, Vicodin, Oxycodone, other opioids

Hero in: central nervous system depressant; reduces  neural  activity  in  various  areas  of  the  brain  (ex:

brainstem areas responsible for respiration, coughing); constricted pupils, slower breathing, lethargy;

feeling of re laxation, euphoria , short-lived effects followed by negative changes in mood, behavior

•	 Chronic use  tolerance 
•	 Withdrawal symptoms: periods of yawning, chills, hot flashes, rest lessness, diarrhea, goose
bumps, 12 hours of sleep 
Hero in and other opioids create a negative  feedback loop:
1.	
Initially these substances produce pleasure by activating the dopamine-based reward system
and binding to opioid receptors, where the body’s endorphins (opio ids produced in the body)
usually bind. 
2.	 With repeated use , the body comes to produce less endorphins, which leaves the user without
natura l means to re lieve pain. 
3.	 More heroin is thus needed to achieve pleasure and the analgesic effect. 
4.	 When the user tries to quit , endorphins do not kick in to alleviate the withdrawa l symptoms,
thus heightening the discomfort – making it difficult to quit . 
Hallucinogens: induces hallucinations (experiences in which people  perceive something that  is not
actually present
Ex: mescaline, peyote, psilocybin, LSD, PCP, ketamine , marijuana 
LSD: synthetic substance  that distorts perception, partly by inducing hallucinations (usually invo lve 
geometric shapes, vivid colors, violent movement) 
•	 Can produce “bad trips” – highly stressful, frightening experiences  suicide , murder 
•  Hallucinations can recur  in the absence of drug use  flashbacks even years afterward 
Marijuana: most commonly used hallucinogen in US 
•	 Active ingredient: THC, which is chemically similar to cannabinoids (naturally occurring
neurotransmitters in the body involved in memory, attention, time and sensory perception,
pleasure, movement control) 
•	 Effects depend on user’s mood, expectations, environment; vary from person to person 
•  Distort ions of space , time; impaired perceptual motor skills
Ketamine: legally used anesthetic for  animals; used by humans to  induce  ha llucinations, anesthesia , 
stimulation of cardiovascular , respiratory systems; associated with vio lence, loss of contact with
reality, impa ired thinking  to lerance, dependence 
Social Support: the help and support  ga ined through interacting with others  that can buffer the 
adverse effects of stress 
•	 Emerges from posit ive relat ionships 
•	 Can lengthen life expectancy; boost immune funct ion 
•	 Perceived social support: the subjective sense  that  support is available  should it be  needed; 
provides the buffer against stress 
•	 Enacted social support: specific supportive behaviors provided by others 
Mind-Body Interventions: engage the mind in particular ways in order to influence the body’s
functioning; a llow you to adapt to a stimulus (not necessarily change it) by altering your body
functioning accordingly
Ex: hypnosis, meditation, yoga , biofeedback, visual mental imagery, cognitive therapy, stress
management / relaxation induct ion, prayer , tai chi
Effects: 
Improved mood, immune system functioning
