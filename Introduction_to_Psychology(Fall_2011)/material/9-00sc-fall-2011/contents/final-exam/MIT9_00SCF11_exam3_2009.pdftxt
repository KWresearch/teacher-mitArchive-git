with increased blood flow to the frontal lobes?  

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

A.  egocentric perspective 
B.  conservation of mass 
C.  theory of mind 
D.  object permanence 

2)  In one study (from Woodward, 1998), 3-month olds and 6-month olds repeatedly 
saw a person reach for an object (ball) on the left and not reach for a teddy bear 
on the right.  Then, they saw a display in which the teddy bear was on the left, 
and the ball on the right.  The person either reached for the teddy bear on the left 
(same action, new object) or the ball on the right (same object, new action).  
Looking time was used as a measure to infer how the 3-month olds and 6-month 
olds interpreted the relation between the initial habituation phase and the 
subsequent changed test phases.  The results indicated 

A.  both 3-month olds and 6-month olds looked longer when the person 
grabbed a new object than when the person made a new action 
B.  both 3-month olds and 6-month olds looked longer when the person made 
a new action than when the person grabbed a new object 
C.  3-month olds looked longer when the person made a new action, but 6 -
month olds looked longer when the person grabbed a new object 
D.  6-month olds looked longer when the person made a new action, but 3-
month olds looked longer when the person grabbed a new object 

3)  Adult development can be studied cross-sectionally or longitudinally.  All of the 
following are true for cross-sectional designs relative to longitudinal designs 
EXCEPT for which answer? 

A.  Cross-sectional designs take less time to accomplish 
B.  Cross-sectional designs are less likely to be confounded by practice 
effects 
C.  Cross-sectional designs are less likely to be confounded by cohort effects
