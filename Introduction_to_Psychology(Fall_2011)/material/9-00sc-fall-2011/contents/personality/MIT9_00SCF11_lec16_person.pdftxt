Average Big Five scores vary somewhat with age and sex.  This graph depicts the mean score for men and women 
on each of the Big Five traits as a function of age.  The results are derived from a sample of 132,515 adults, aged 
21‐60, who completed a version of the Big Five Personality Inventory that was posted on the Internet.  Other 
studies, using more systematically chosen samples, have shown similar results.  (Adapted from Srivastava &

PERSONALITY
• identical twins reared apart - both 
very neat
“My mother.  When I was growing up 
she always kept the house perfectly 
ordered… I learned from her.  What 
else could I do?”
“The reason is quite simple. I’m 
reacting to my mother, who was a 
complete slob.”

30

Personality
• biological, non-twin siblings were far 
more similar to one another than 
adoptive siblings (genetics?)
• for personality, children no more similar 
to adoptive sibling than two randomly 
selected children
• family plays little or no role?
• does personality fix the environment? 
sibling contrast? split-parent 
identification?

conscientiousness - 19 behaviors -
making bed, attend class, complete 
assignments, neat class notes -
consistent with situations, not across 
situations - situationism

Variation of Verbal Aggression Across Situations

Situation‐specific profiles of verbal aggression for two children.  Shoda, Mischel, and Wright (1994) recorded 
various categories of behaviors among emotionally disturbed children in various social situations at a 
summer camp.  Shown here are results concerning verbal aggressiveness for two children.  Zero on the y axis 
represents the average aggressiveness for all the children observed.  In overall verbal aggressiveness, these 
two children were similar, but they were very different with respect to the situations that elicited their 
aggression.

Personality
Temperament - innate, biologically based 
propensity to engage in a certain style 
of behavior

broader than traits - observable
activity level
emotionality
sociability

35

Personality
Temperament - SHYNESS
• some babies (6 weeks) more reactive to 
environmental stimuli - fussy - 15-20%
• “high-reactive” or “inhibited” babies (vs. “low 
reactive”) - more crying, distress, motor 
activity, faster heart rates, higher levels of 
cortisol
• faster heart rate in womb more likely to be 
reactive - sympathetic nervous system 
easily aroused, seek less arousing situation, 
inhibited 

36

Personality
Temperament - SHYNESS
• Signs of inhibition at 2 months or 
4 months predict shyness in later 
childhood and adulthood
• 25% however are inhibited as 
infants but not shy in later 
childhood

37

Personality
• over 1,000 children born in a year 
categorized as “well adjusted” or 
“inhibited” or “undercontrolled” at 
age 3
• 97% examined at age 21

Temperament - SENSATION SEEKING
• pursuit of novel, high-stimulation 
situations
• diving, fast driving, drug/alcohol use,
