***** Discussion: Personality *****
Why do we behave as we do? How is it based on our predisposition to handle
certain situations in certain ways? These are such interesting topics, and
they're really at the core of psychology. Why do people do what they do? Some
people like to talk to other people, and some people like to sit at home, and
some people like to try new thingsâ¦ Read_more_Â»

Explain the following terms: personality trait, personality inventory, and
personality dimension. How are they related?
âº Sample answer
A personality trait is "a relatively consistent tendency to think, feel, or
behave in a characteristic way across a range of situations"; a personality
inventory is a lengthy assessment of personality, in which participants
indicate how well certain descriptors apply to them; a personality dimension is
a collection of personality traits that tend to pattern together. A personality
dimension is also called a superfactor, and includes descriptors such as
"conscientiousness" and "neuroticism." Generally, personality inventories
assess individuals' self-rankings on a variety of personality traits, and
report an average score along any of a number of personality dimensions.
Â 
Personality is thought to have a biological basis. Explain the difference
between personality traits and temperament. What is some evidence that
personality has a biological (genetic) basis?
âº Sample answer
Temperament is "an inclination to engage in a certain style of thinking,
feeling, or behaving" which initially arises from the effects of genes and is
moderated by the environment. Unlike personality traits, which can be variable
across situations (e.g., "I am a talkative person," may be true of you when you
are with close friends, but untrue when you are among strangers), temperaments
are consistent across situations. Examples of temperaments include sociability
and impulsivity.
Personality (temperament and personality traits) are believed to be in part
genetically determined due to their consistency across the lifespan, as well as
through twin studies and other measures of heritability. (*Recall that studies
of heritability measure how much of the variance of a particular feature (e.g.,
temperament or intelligence) in a population can be related to genetics vs.
environmental factors. Heritability does not indicate the probability /
proportion of a trait inherited from parents.)
Â 
Describe some of the well-documented environmental effects on personality.
âº Sample answer
Two well-documented examples of environmental effects on personality are birth
order and culture. Birth order is known to affect personality such that oldest
and only children tend to be more ambitious, status-seeking, and assertive;
whereas youngest children tend to be more agreeable and fun-loving. Culture is
known to affect personality through the differences in personality dimensions
attested across cultures. Some cultures tend to be more individualistic vs.
collectivist (interested in the needs of the group). We also self-assess our
personality through the lens of those around us. People who are surrounded by
extremely conscientious peers may rate themselves lower on conscientiousness-
related traits in personality inventories.
