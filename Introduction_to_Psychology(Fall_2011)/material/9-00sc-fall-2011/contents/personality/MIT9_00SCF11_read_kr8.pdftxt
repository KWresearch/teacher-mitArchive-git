KOSSLYN CHAPTER 8 – Personality: Vive La Différence 
PERSONALITY: a set of emotional, cognitive , and behavioral tendencies that people  display over
time and across situations and that distinguish from each other 
Freud  Dynamic Personality 
 Aka psychoanalytic theory: the mind can be analyzed to understand the causes of mental 
events and behaviors 
Psychological determinism: the view that all thoughts, fee lings, and behavior, no  matter
how mundane or insignificant , ult imately have an underlying psychological cause 
 Sex and aggression are the primary motivating forces of human behavior 
 Personality is a bubbling cauldron, rocked by unconscious, irrat ional forces at war with one
another , competing for expression and preventing the individual’s exercise of free w ill. Tension
arises when thoughts and desires are not allowed to be expressed. 
•	 Consciousness is divided into 3 leve ls 
1.	 Normal awareness (conscious)  = thoughts, feelings, motivations that you are aware of 
2.	 Preconscious = subjective materia l that you can easily bring into conscious awareness, but
are not aware of most of the time (ex: your te lephone number) 
3.	 Unconscious = thoughts, feelings, motivations tha t you can’t voluntarily bring into
consciousness, yet still influence your thoughts, feelings, and behavior (this is where most
of your thoughts, fee lings, motivations live!) 
Freud’s 3 Mental Structures: 
Id: exists at birth, houses sexual and aggressive drives, physica l needs, and simple

1.	
psycho logical needs; lives by pleasure principle (i.e.: instant  gratification, regardless of

consequences)

2.	 Superego: formed during early childhood a fter id and ego , houses the sense  of right  and
wrong, based on the interna lization of parental and cultura l mortality; tries to prevent the
expression of id’s inappropriate sexual and aggressive impulses; can cause fee lings of guilt, 
leading to inadequacy; responsible for ego ideal (provides the ultimate standard of what a 
person should be) 
3.	 Ego: develops in childhood, tries to balance  the competing demands of id, superego, and
reality; guided by reality principle (assess what is most rea list ically possible  in the world);
responsible for problem solving and reasoning 
Childhood is central in determining the formation of personality. 
•	 Psychosexual stages: 5 distinct deve lopmental stages based on erogenous zones (areas of the 
body that can provide sat isfact ion of instinctual drives: mouth, anus, gential); the specific
needs of each stage must be met for its successful resolut ion 
o	 Oral; Anal; Phallic; Latency; Genita l 
o	 Each zone demands some  form of sexual grat ification, with a different zone be ing 
prominent during each stage. 
o	
If a child does not satisfy the needs of a given stage, s/he w ill develop a fixation (state
in which energy is still focused on an earlier stage of development , even as the child
moves on to the next stage). 
People will regress to the thoughts, feelings, behaviors of the fixated stage  in 

times of stress. 
Fixat ion can create neurosis: an abnorma l behavior pattern relat ing to a conflict

between the ego and e ither the id or the superego . 
 Psychosis: conflict between ego and reality  break from rea lity 
o	 Oedipus complex: boys in the phallic stage jealously love their  mothers, view  fathers as
competitors for their mothers’ love, so they both fear and heat their fathers 
 Castration anxiety: a boy’s fear that as punishment for loving mother and
hating father , his father will cut off his penis

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 8 – Personality: Vive La Différence 
Solution: boy identifies with father , accepts subordinate position to “ introject”

his father’s morality as part of his superego 
o	 Electra complex: girls in the  phallic stage  are  preoccupied  with  the  discovery  that  they
don’t have penises, which leads them to have penis envy; girls unconsciously struggle
with feelings of anger and jealousy toward the mother (anger for ne ither providing a
penis for daughter nor having one herse lf,  jealousy  because  of  the  mother’s
relationship with the father); girls ambiva lent ly identify w ith mothers 
Justification of women’s lower status in Victorian society: partia lly reso lved

phallic stage, less we ll-developed superego , less ego strength, less ability to 
negotiate between reality and id 
Defense Mechanisms: unconscious processes that  prevent unacceptable thoughts or urges from
reaching conscious awareness. Relying too much on a particular defense mechanism will result in
neurosis. 
1.	 Repression – most important ; ego directly blocks threatening unconscious thoughts, impulses,
and memories from entering consciousness. 
o	
[Ex: “forgetting” to go to dentist] 
2.	 Denial –  threatening thoughts are denied outright. 
o	
[Ex: denial of a drinking problem] 
3.	
Intellectualization –  threatening thoughts or  emotions are kept at  arm’s length by thinking
about them rationally and logically. 
o	
[Ex: While watching a scary movie , you focus on make-up, camera angles, other 
emotiona lly non-threatening details.] 
4.	 Projection – threatening thoughts are  projected onto (attributed to) others. 
o	
[Ex: accusing someone e lse of wanting an affa ir when you rea lly do] 
5.	 Rationalization –  creating explanations to justify threatening thoughts or actions. 
o	
[Ex: instead of studying, you watch a football game, fail the exam , but say that you’ll
“make up for it on the final exam”] 
6.	 Reaction Formation – unconsciously changing an unacceptable feeling into its opposite. 
o	
[Ex: transforming your anger at your boss’ obnoxious behavior into appreciat ion of 
“his fairness as a manger”] 
7.  Sublimation – threatening impulses are directed into more socially acceptable activities. 
o	
[Ex: playing hockey instead of getting into fights] 
8.	 Undoing – your act ions try to “undo” a threatening wish or thought. 
o	
[Ex: you think of eating several slices of chocolate cake, so you go to the gym and work
out for an hour] 
Neo-Freudians: expanded on Freud’s work; deemphasized sexua lity 
•	 Carl Jung: emphasized collective unconscious (the unconscious storehouse of ideas and 
memories common to all humankind), including archetypes (the  basic persona lity types found 
in a ll cultures and folklore) 
•	 Alfred Adler: emphasized fee lings of inferiority and helplessness in personality formation.
Feelings of inferiority fuel the striving for superiority; if inferiority feelings become too severe, 
they can lead to an inferiority complex, which hampers such strivings 
•	 Karen Horney: emphasized parent-child interactions, proposing that parents should show
warmth, respect, and consistent interest in  the ir children; proposed that girls did not have 
penis envy, but privilege envy (the desire  for  the  privileges that go along with having a penis) 
Faults of Freudian Theory
1.	 Not testable 
2.	 Complicated so that it can explain, or explain away, a lmost anything 
3.	 Doesn’t generalize well to most people : Freud developed his theory by analyz ing mostly
female patients and himse lf (inherent bias)

Strengths: 
1.	 The type of attachment we have to our parents predicts the type of attachment we will have to 
a partner / own children. 
2.	 Defense mechanisms as coping styles 
3.	 Broad idea that some menta l processes can be unconscious (i.e .: occurring w ithout awareness) 
HUMANISTIC PSYCHOLOGY  Thinking Positively 
Focus on people’s positive aspects  innate  goodness, creativity, free w ill 
We all strive to achieve self-actualization: an inna te motivation to attain our highest emot ion and 
intellectua l potent ial 
Appeals to people because of its emphasis on the uniqueness of each person and on free w ill
How you live your life  is determined  not  by  unconscious  force  but  by  using  your  conscious
awareness and your freedom to choose your experiences
Faults : difficult to test; too idea listic; do we  really need unconditional positive regard a ll the t ime? 
Carl Rogers: deve loped theory of personality as well as a form of psychotherapy – client-centered 
therapy 
Self-concept: our sense of ourselves and of how others see  us  this is in part a reflection of 
how others see us… so we have a basic need for unconditional positive regard: acceptance 
without any conditions 
o	 Ex: adults praise children for behaving in accordance with societal rules, which leads
children to learn conditions of worth, or “what it takes” to be treated as worthwhile . 
Some aspects of persona lity (ex: motives) revo lve around meeting condit ions or worth in
order to be accepted by others, so people spend too much time / energy pleasing others and
not achieving their full potential. 
o	
Solution: adults need to distinguish between a child’s inappropriate behavior and
his/her worth as a human being 

•	

•	

People have enduring personality traits: relatively consistent tendencies to think, feel, or behave  in a
characteristic way across a range of situations
Allport: Some persona lity traits can be grouped as central traits  (traits that affect a wide range of 
behavior , vary from individua l to individual ) 
•	 Traits are not always accurate in predicting behavior! 
The situations in which we find ourselves can exert powerful influences on behaviors, thoughts,

feelings.

Hartshorne & May: investigated whether honesty applies across situations in children

•	 Children who were honest in one situation were not necessarily honest in another. There was
some consistency across situations, but less <10% of the differences in behavior across 
situations could be explained by the one trait of honesty. 
•	 The more similar the situations, the more likely it was that each child behaved similarly across
situations (ex: lying about number of push-ups more similar to amount of work done than 
stealing)
Mischel: found inconsistencies in how people behave across situations that draw on the same trait
Different measures of what should be the same tra it often were only weakly correlated or not re lated
at all. The “same” trait can also be expressed in different ways. 
Theory of Situationism: a person’s behavior is mostly governed by the  particular situation, not  by 
internal tra its 
Situation doesn’t determine everything  persona lity characteristics interact  with the

•	
situation

9.00 EXAM 3 NOTES 
KOSSLYN CHAPTER 8 – Personality: Vive La Différence 

Interactionism: interaction between personality and the situation 
3 Major Factors:
1.	 The same “objective” situation is experienced differently by people who have different
personalit ies. When different individuals are in the same situation, they differ in what they
pay attention to , how they interpret the st imuli they perceive, what emot ions are associated
with those stimuli, and then how they respond. 
2.	 Our personalities partly create  our  situations. 
3.	 People often can choose their situations (jobs, friends, le isure act ivities). People tend to choose
environments that fit their  personalities 
The more narrowly a personality trait is defined, the better it predicts behavior, but the fewer
situations there are to which it can be applied. Personality traits can also be very broadly defined as
personality dimensions: sets of re lated personality traits.... aka superfactors. 
Factor analysis (takes a set of correlat ions and derives dimensions that underlie those
•	
correlations)
Disadvantage of superfactors: they predict behavior less we ll than do the traits on which they are 
built. (i.e.: People attain high scores by being extreme on different traits that are part of that
dimension / score high on the dimension for different reasons) 
The Big 5 Superfactors and The ir Tra its: (OCEAN)
Openness  fantasy, aesthetics, feelings, act ions,  ideas, va lues 
Conscientiousness (aka dependability)  competence, order, dutifulness, achievement striving, 
deliberation, se lf-discipline 
Extraversion (aka  sociability)  warmth, gregariousness, assertiveness, activity, excitement seeking, 
posit ive emotions 
Agreeableness  trust , straightforwardness, altruism , compliance, modesty, tender-mindedness  
Neuroticism (aka emotiona lity)  anxiety, hostility, depression, self-consciousness, impulsiveness, 
vulnerability 
Hans Eysenck  3 superfactors [extraversion, neuroticism, psychotism (lose touch w ith reality, ex:
schizophrenia; social deviance, lack of conventional socialization)] 
Some people have suggested using nonconformity or social deviance rather than psychotism  to 
highlight the tra its of creativity and nonconformity that are a lso part of this dimension (ex: 
artists) 
Although different mode ls may group personality traits differently, all mode ls include some version
of the broad persona lity characteristics of extraversion and neurot icism . 
Measuring Personality
Most methods of assessing personality measure behaviors that psycho logists believe to be expressions
of a given trait , and then infer the strength of the trait from the behaviors. 
4 Methods: 
Interview  people respond to verbal questions 
•	
•	 Observation noting / recording behavior 
Inventory: most common method; a lengthy quest ionnaire for assessing personality that
•	
requires the test takers to read statements and to indicate whether each is true or false about
themse lves or to indicate how much they agree or disagree with each statement (a long a 
mult ipo int sca le) 
o	 Result: personality profile – a  graphic summary of the scores of the different  traits that
constitute someone’s persona lity.

o	 Usually assess many different traits, contain 300+ test statements to  include items that 
address different facets of each trait 
o	 Used by mental health professionals to assess mental illness; research psycho logists to
invest igate the possible reasons for differences in personality traits; employers to assess 
how personality characteristics are related to aspects of job performance 
o	 Advantages: easy to administer, computers make them easy to score / interpret ; easy
way to compare the same personality traits among different people 
o	 Disadvantages: limited type of information that can be  obtained from  the  questions on
the inventory; responses can be biased (people check off “agree” more often than
“disagree ,” regardless of the content of the statement… aka acquiescence) 
Solution: word ha lf of the items negatively 

 Social desirability: source of bias in responding to questions that occurs when
people try to make themselves “look good” even if it means giving answers
that are not accurate 
•  Solution: answers are sca led untrue answers); 
o	 Ex: Raymond Catell’s 16 PF 
o	 Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2 : assesses psychopathology 
o	 NEO-PI-R (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness… Revised) Personality Inventory 
assesses 30 persona lity traits from the 5 Factor Model; can be completed by individual
whose persona lity is be ing assessed or by someone close to that individua l; valid and 
reliable 
•	 Projective Test: method used to  assess personality and psychopathology that  asks the  test-
taker to make sense of ambiguous stimuli (people’s personalities can be revea led by what they  
project onto ambiguous st imuli as their minds impose structure on them) 
o	 Ex: Rorschach Test: inkblots that people are  asked to interpret 
 Questionable validity and reliability 
o	 Ex: Thematic Apperception Test (TAT): set of detailed black-and-white draw ings; for
each drawing, the test taker is asked to te ll a story about what the drawing illustrates 
 Faults : although systematic scoring systems exist, only 3%  of clinicians actually
use a scoring system to  interpret the TAT , prefer to rely on intuitive
interpretations of participants’ responses; from a person’s response to the cards,
the test administrator cannot distinguish between how the person actua lly
thinks, feels, and would behave versus how the person wishes to think, feel,
and behave 
 Strengths: the  tests’  abilities to predict future behavior depend not only on the
test administrator’s experience, but on the specific behavior(s) that the tests are
being used to predict 

BIOLOGY’S  INFLUENCES ON PERSONALITY

Some aspects of persona lity are biologica lly based, so personalities are partly born, not entirely made.

Temperament: an inclinat ion to engage in a certa in style of thinking, feeling, behaving; a
temperament initially arises from the effects of genes and bio logy, and an individual’s
environment moderates  these  effects  
•	 Affects what people think, feel, and do as we ll as how they think, feel, and act in the ways that
they do 
•	 Relatively consistent throughout the life span, consistent across situations 
≠ persona lity traits 
•	
Buss & Plomin  4 broad dimensions of temperament  (existing along a cont inuum) 
1.	 Sociability: a  preference for  be ing in the  company of others rather  than alone 

Please pardon any spelling errors or typos! 

5 

9.00 EXAM 3 NOTES 
KOSSLYN CHAPTER 8 – Personality: Vive La Différence 
2.	 Emotionality: an inclination to  become aroused in emotional situations, but only when the
emotion of distress, fear , or anger is invo lved 
3.	 Activity: a preference for a part icular activity leve l, which has 2 components – vigor (the  
intensity of activity) and tempo (the speed of activity) 
Impulsivity: a tendency to respond to stimuli immediately, w ithout reflect ion or concern for 
4.	
consequences 
Kagan  is extreme shyness innate? Some babies are more reactive / sensitive  to environmental
stimuli, and are more fussy than other babies 
“high-reactive” infants are more like ly than “ low-reactive” babies to respond to a recording of 
•	
a woman’s voice / colored toy with crying, genera l distress, increased motor activity; have
faster heart rates, higher levels of cortiso l 
•	 Babies with a  fast heart rate in the womb are more  likely later to become  inhibited, fearful
children who startle more easily  shy teenagers / adults who feel fear and distress in social 
situations 
•	 The ways the family and culture react toward inhibited, shy behavior w ill determine how a
person thinks and fee ls about him/herse lf. 
o	 Ex: American culture favors outgoing people ;  puts  shy  people  at  disadvantage  
negative self-image  increased likelihood of an autonomic reaction in social 
situations 
Some toddlers “outgrow” the inhibition; not all inhibited children become shy adults. 
•	
•	 The environment can play a role in diminishing the effects of shyness / maintaining shyness 
into adulthood. 
•	 Children at extremes of shyness / outgoingness are the least likely to change over time 

Sensation-seeking: the pursuit of nove lty or highly stimulating pursuits (ex: sky-diving, fast driving, 
drug / alcoho l use) or occupations (ex: working in hospita l ER) 
•	 These people are more likely to send angry e-mails, surf vs. play golf, prefer visiting museums
of modern art vs. ancient art , listen to punk music 
•	 High sensation seeks view a given situation as less risky than do low sensation seekers 

BIOLOGICALLY BASED THEORIES OF PERSONALITY 
Jeffrey Gray  2  brain systems can explain broad aspects of temperament and personality: 
1.	 Behavioral Activation System (BAS) – mechanism based on act ivat ion of behavior and on the 
effects of reward on behavior 
•	 Triggers positive feelings (ex: elation, hope), underlies impulsivity 
•	 People with an easily activated BAS tend to respond readily to even minor incentives
and rewards; more likely to have problems with substance abuse 
•	 Underlies impulsivity  people w ith an easily act ivated BAS respond readily to even
minor incentives / rewards 
•	 Associated with extraversion 
2.	 Behavioral  Inhibition System (BIS) –  mechanism based on inhibition of behavior and on effects of 
punishment on behavior 
•	 Activated by threat-related stimuli and punishment, triggering anxiety and inhibit 
behavior 
•	 People with an easily activated BIS become distressed when confronted w ith even
minor threats; people with an insensitive BIS are not distressed by most threats even 
when confronted with significant threats. 
•	 Associated with anxiety, depression, neuroticism 
•  These 2 systems arise from characteristics of specific brain structures, neurotransmitters.

9.00 EXAM 3 NOTES 
KOSSLYN CHAPTER 8 – Personality: Vive La Différence 

Eysenck’s Theory  bio logical mechanisms underlie 3 persona lity dimensions
A hierarchy where the personality dimensions are composed of more specific tra its, which in turn
arise from automat ic response, which are themselves based on specific, learned associations between
a stimulus and response . 
•	 EXTRAVERSION  the cortex of extraverts (compared to  introverts) is less easily aroused by
stimulation of the senses (i.e.: it takes more stimulation to arouse / overstimulate extroverts). 
o	 Because of this higher threshold, extraverts seek out act ivities that are more 
stimulating and arousing (ex: hang-gliding / espionage) 
o	
Introverts and extroverts have different biologica l responses to caffeine , nicotine , and
sedatives, reward and punishment, even different patterns of brain waves. 
o	 Research has yielded mixed results 
•	 NEUROTICISM  those who  score high on the dimension of neuroticism are  easily and
intensely emotionally aroused and so are more likely to experience conditioned emotional 
responses (i.e.: emotional responses e licited by previously neutral stimuli… ex: fear) 
•	 PSYCHOTICISM  those high on psychoticism  have  less control over their  emotions and
therefore are more likely to be aggressive or impulsive, engage in de linquent behavior 
o	 Research on the relationship between psychot icism and social deviance has yielded 
complex results and social deviance is associated with high scores of psychoticism
usually only in conjuncton w ith high scores on neuroticism and/or extraversion. 
o	 Because other personality dimensions affect  the way psychot icism  influences
personality, it is understandable that research has not revealed specific bio logical
underpinnings of psychoticism. 
Cloninger’s Theory   people differ on 4 basic personality dimensions: 
1.	 Reward dependence (desire  for  socially rewarding experiences; its opposite  is a loofness; re lated 
to BAS) 
2.	 Harm avoidance (pessimism , shyness, fear of uncertainty, inhibition of approach behaviors, 
increase in avo idance behaviors, related to BIS) 
3.	 Novelty seeking  (excited response to new  situations; related to BAS) 
4.  Persistence  (tendency to continue to seek a goa l in the face of obstacles or resistance)
Each of these dimensions corresponds to some combination of Big Five superfactors and is associated 
with a distinct brain system. 
•	 Ex: novelty seeking  combination of a high score on extraversion, low score on

conscientiousness in the Big Five; re lated to dopamine -0based reward system in bra in

Zuckerman’s Theory  Alternative 5 
1.	 Sociability ~ extraversion 
2.	 Neuroticism-anxiety ~ neuroticism 
3.	
Impulsive sensation seeking – tendency to act  impulsive ly; reconceptua liation of Eysenck’s
psychot icism , re lated to sensation seeking and Gray’s BAS; opposite end of the Big Five’s
conscientiousness superfactor ; more typical of men than women; associated with insensitivity
to punishment or loss of reward; heritable?? 
4.	 Activity – need for activity, high energy leve l, preference for cha llenges, difficulty in relaxing 
5.	 Aggression-hostility –  tendency toward antisocial behavior, verbal aggression, vengefulness

The Heritability of Personality
Many researchers have reported evidence that genes influence personality.
Behavioral genetics: focuses on sorting out  the  influence of heredity vs. environment on thoughts,
feelings, and behaviors.
Identical twins (share virtually all of their genes) have more similar personalities than do the fraternal 
twins (share 50% of their genes). Identical twins have higher corre lations between their scores
on personality tests than do the fraternal tw ins.
Even identical tw ins ra ised apart score similarly on personality tests.
Heritability: number  that  quantifies the amount of variation in characteristics that  arises from genes
Associations of a personality dimension / trait with different alleles of a gene.
Genes influence different personality dimensions and traits more or  less strongly, and to different 
degrees of influence .
Genetic differences predict behaviors as well (ex: amount of time spent watching TV, number of
childhood accidents, tendency to marry, religious attitudes)
Different genes may underlie variat ions in happiness for men and women: 
Subjective sense of we ll-being has a higher heritability in women than in men 
•	
Genes can affect personality both directly (ex: through temperament) and indirectly (ex: through the 
types of responses a person elicits from others). But this doesn’t mean that personality is fixed from 
birth to death! 
Other factors also shape persona lity.
Family environment is not a large contributor to personality traits 
•	 Exception: socia l closeness (desire for intimacy with others), positive emotionality (a set of
traits characterized by an active engagement in one’s environment) 
•	 Many aspects of the family environment are not truly shared. 
Problems in determining how genes contribute to personality: 
•	 Most aspects of personality are affected by numerous genes that exert their influence in 
concert . It is unusua l for a single gene to influence a personality dimension. (Exception:
novelty seeking) 
•	 Variat ions in a single gene, interacting with other genes, may affect more  than one aspect of
personality. 
•	 The effects of any one gene are subt le. 
Most common explanation for how genes exert their influence: neurotransmitters… ??????

Learning and Personality:

An individual’s inclination to behave in consistent ways arises from his / her conditioning history:

•	 Classica lly conditioned behaviors: phobias 
•	 Operantly conditioned behaviors: taking part in highly stimulating activities because of past
reinforcement 
•	 Behaviors learned through observation: being po lite

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 8 – Personality: Vive La Différence 
Sociocognitive View of Personality: 
Social interactiosn affect thoughts, feelings, and behaviors  consistent thoughts, fee lings, 
•	
behaviors create persona lity, a ffect which stimuli are attended to / ignored. 
Expectancies: expectations that have a powerful influence  on thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and in
turn, on personality 
•	 Expectations can arise from learning 
•	 To the extent that expectancies are consistent across situations, they can be thought of as
personality traits. 
•	 Acknow ledges influence of biological factors on personality traits and dimensions, but
emphasizes the role of the person’s experiences, of consistent patterns of menta l processing, of 
the se lf-concept , and of behavior. 
Stresses that society and culture contribute to a person’s experiences and ultimately even
affect biology 
When the cause of an event is ambiguous,  people  differ  in  the  extent  to  which  they  perceive  that  they  
have control over the event 
•	 Locus of control: a person’s perception of the source of control over  life’s events when the
cause of events is ambiguous 
o	
Internals – control over events comes from within, feel personally responsible for what
happens to them, increase expectancies in response to success, lower expectancies in 
response to failure 
o	 Externals – control comes from  outside  forces, feel  less persona l responsibility, lower 
expectancies a fter success, raise them after failure 
o	 Locus of control has changed over time  college students are becoming increasingly 
externa l in their locus of control 
Self-Efficacy: sense of having the ability to fo llow  through and produce specific desired behaviors 
•	 High  you can behave in a specific way if you want to 
Bandura : self-efficacy  he lps  people  be lieve  in  themselves  and  in  their  ability  to  change  or  perform
behaviors previously viewed as difficult or impossible 

SOCIOCULTURAL INFLUENCES ON PERSONALITY 
Birth Order 
Sulloway: used meta-analyses  to  show  that  openness  to  experience  is  shaped  by  birth  order ,  but  birth
order is not the only factor involved (ex: number of children in family, conflict, sex, number of years
between siblings, temperament, social class, loss of parent, etc.) 
•	 Why do some people support revolutions whereas others maintain status quo 
•	 Opposite views can occur within the same family. 
Firstborns / “Only” children are more likely to support parental authority, see things as their 
•	
parents do, be less open to new ideas and experiences 
•	 Younger siblings, because they must find a different niche in the family and in the world
around them, are more like ly to be open to new ideas and experiences 
•	 Middle children are less like ly to define the ir self-identities by family than are both their elder 
or younger siblings  react more to  the  word “ friends” than “brothers / sisters”; less like ly to
define  themselves by family name; more rebellious / impulsive; less conscient ious 
Gender 
Women score higher on traits reflecting social  connectedness (focus on the  importance of relationships)
and measures of neurot icism , tend to be more empathic than men; report more nurturing tendencies.

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 8 – Personality: Vive La Différence 
Men score higher on traits reflecting individuality,  autonomy (focus on separateness from others, 
achievement , se lf-sufficiency), measures of anger and aggression 
Why sex differences in personality tra its may exist : 
Social Role Theory  boys and girls learn different  skills and beliefs based on the socia l roles of  
•	
males and females 
o	 Beliefs and skills become so  ingrained that  they lead individuals to think, fee l, and act
in consistent ways across a variety of situat ions. 
o	 Expectancy effects (how boys and girls are expected to behave) 
o	 The importance of context?? (i.e .: interactions with same-sex friends vs. opposite-sex 
strangers) 
o	 Although differences between men’s and women’s personalities have been observed,
they do not necessarily arise in all –  or even most – situations 
•	 Bio logical 
o	 Hormone differences: testosterone 
o	 Evolutionary theory: differences in mate selection and parenting strategies have given
rise to the sex difference in social connectedness 
 Women have greater investment in offspring  caretaker role  more strongly 
attached to children  survival advantage 
o	 Differences between men and women are not as large as differences within each sex! 

CULTURE AND PERSONALITY 
Personality changes within a culture, over  time 
Increasing external locus of control 
•	
Increased anxiety / neuroticism 
•	
Increased extraversion 
•	
•	 Reflect cultural / environmenta l shifts  increasing fear of crime , terrorism, other dangers ;
increased value placed on traits re lated to extraversion; decreased emphasis on persona lity
