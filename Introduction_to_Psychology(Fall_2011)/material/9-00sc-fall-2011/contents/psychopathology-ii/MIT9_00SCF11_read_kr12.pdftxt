KOSSLYN CHAPTER 12 – Treatment: Healing Actions, Healing Words 
INSIGHT-ORIENTED THERAPY: a ims to remove distressing symptoms by leading person to
understand the psycho logical causes of his/her symptoms through deeply fe lt personal insights 
•	 Once someone truly understands the psychological causes of distressing symptoms, the 
symptoms themselves will diminish 
Psychoanalysis: intensive  form of therapy, originally based on Freud’s theory of personality, based
on the idea that psycho logical difficulties are caused by unconscious conflicts; not very common
Psychodynamic Theory: less intensive (and more common) form  of psychoanalysis 

Psychodynamic Theory 
less intense: 
1-2 times / wk = 12 sessions 
focus on current relationships 

Psychoanalysis 
more intense : 
Intensity of Treatment  4 times / wk for 4 yrs = 835 sessions 
Modified Goals 
focus on past relationships 
 Review Freud’s Psychoanalyt ic Theory <id, superego, ego> 
•	 The id strives for immediate gratification of needs; the superego tries to impose its version of
morality; the ego attempts to balance the demands of id, superego, and external reality
Only after true understanding (insight) is attained can people choose more adaptive, satisfying, and
productive behaviors. Forces that remain unconscious shape behavior in undesirable ways. 
•  To Freud, psychoanalysis isn’t a cure –  it  just  transforms an individual’s abject misery into 
ordinary unhappiness.
GOAL: bring unconscious impulses, conflicts into awareness; link person’s current difficulties with
past experiences and relationships; re lationship w ith therapist can provide  a  corrective  emotional  
experience that can lead to changes in symptoms, behavior , and personality 
Techniques of Psychoanalysis and Psychodynamic Therapies  “talking cure” 
Free association: the patient  says whatever  comes to mind, and the  train of thought  reveals the 
patient’s issues and ways of dealing w ith them
Dream analysis: therapist  examines the  content  of dreams to gain access to the unconscious 
Interpretation: technique in which the therapist  deciphers the pat ient’s words and behaviors, 
assigning unconscious motivations to them 
•	 Patients are made of their defense mechanisms –  unconscious processes that prevent

unacceptable thoughts or urges from reaching conscious awareness

•  Freudian slips – unconscious thoughts or urges that slip out and have unconscious meanings 
Resistance : patient is re luctant  or refuses to  cooperate with analyst or  therapist; can range from
unconscious forgetting to outright refusal to comply w ith a therapist’s request ; can occur as patient
explores or remembers painful feelings or experiences 
Transference : patients relate to  their therapists as  they did to  some important person in their lives 
•	 Therapist’s acceptance of uncomfortable or shameful feelings he lps patients accepts those
feelings in order to choose whether to  act on them 
•	 Patient-therapist relationship can allow the therapist to provide the patient with a new,
posit ive experience of relationships. 
Psychoanalysis has become  less popular , less common because  it is expensive and t ime  intensive,
rarely paid for by hea lth insurance, and studies generally have not found that psychoana lysis
effectively treats various disorders. 
Psychodynamic therapies are difficult to evaluate because:
1.	 There hasn’t been much research on treatment, outcomes of therapies 
2.	 Research on  psychodynamic  therapy  has  genera lly  focused  on  case  studies  of  single  pat ients,
which limits the reliability and generalizability of the finding

3.	 A therapist’s interpretations, which are a crucial component of the treatment , may or may not
be correct and it  is difficult to test the accuracy of a therapist’s interpretations. Some  research
suggests that interpretations are not helpful to treatment.
Some studies have found that short-term psychodynamic therapy may be effective, but aren’t 

superior to other short-term treatments.

Psychodynamic theory is most effective with patients who can art iculate their feelings and want to

understand the ir unconscious mental processes (and who have t ime, money for lengthy treatment)

HUMANISTIC THERAPY / CLIENT-CENTERED THERAPY: insight-oriented therapy that focuses
on people’s potent ial for growth and the importance of an empathetic therapist 
•	 Deve loped by Carl Rogers 
“Patient” is ca lled a “client” 
•	
•	 Distressing symptoms grow out of a blocked potential for personal growth. Therapy is

designed to dismant le the block so that clients can reach their full potential

•	 Problems arise form a  lack of a coherent, unified sense of self  Incongruence  (a mismatch 
between a person’s real se lf and his / her ideal self). 
•	 By helping clients  develop  realistic  “idea l  se lves”  and  then  he lp  them  become  more  like  their
idea l se lves, client-centered therapy reduces the incongruence , and the clients feel better. 
Techniques of Client-Centered Therapy:
To be effective , the therapist must be warm, open, receptive, able to see the world as the client does 
Empathy – shows client that they are understood
Unconditional Positive Regard –  convey positive  feelings for  the  client , regardless of the client’s
thoughts, feelings, or actions; therapist must demonstrate to the client that s/he is inherently worthy 
as a human be ing 
Research results have not shown that client-centered therapy is better than other forms of therapy, but
almost all forms of therapy incorporate Rogers’s view that the therapists’ warmth, empathy, and
posit ive regard for the client are fundamental for a working re lationship between client and therapist. 

•	

COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOR THERAPY: designed to help patients both to reduce problematic
behaviors and irrational thoughts and to develop new, more adaptive behaviors and beliefs to replace 
the old, maladaptive ones 
Behavior Therapy: focuses on changing observable, measurable behaviors 
•	 Behavior therapy rests on well-researched principles of classical and operant conditioning 
•	 Unlike insight-oriented therapies, behavior therapy focused so lely on modifying problemat ic
behaviors, not interested in discovering unconscious “root causes” 
Interest in the ABC’s of Behavior [Antecedents (i.e .: stimuli that trigger problematic behavior);
Behavior; Consequences (i.e .: what is re inforcing the behavior)] 
Techniques based on Classical Conditioning: 
Exposure: rests on principle of habituation; clients are asked to  expose  themselves to feared stimuli in
a planned and gradual way (imagina l; in vivo ; virtual rea lity) 
Exposure with response prevention: planned, programmatic procedure that requires client  to encounter 
anxiety-provoking object or situation, but has client abstain from making the usual madapat ive 
response 
•	 Ex: OCD people purposely get hand dirty during therapy session, and then stop themselves
from washing their hands immediately afterward 
•  Also used to treat people with bulimia
Stimulus control: controlling exposure to a stimulus that e licits a condit ioned response, so as to 
decrease or  increase the frequency of the response

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 12 – Treatment: Healing Actions, Healing Words 
Systematic desensitization: teaches people to  be  relaxed in the  presence of a feared object  or situation 
2 steps: 
•	 Progressive muscle relaxation: person alternates tensing and relaxing muscles sequentially 
from one end of the body to the other, usually from feet to head 
•	 Contact with the feared st imulus through a hierarchy of real / imagined activities 
Techniques based on Operant Conditioning for behavior modification 
Reinforcement and punishment: setting the proper response contingencies – behaviors that w ill earn 
reinforcement –  is crucial 
Extinction –  eliminating a  behavior  by not reinforcing it 
Self-monitoring techniques: help client  identify a  problematic behavior  as well as its antecedents and 
consequences, usually through a daily, written log 
Token economies: use secondary reinforcers (ex: candy, TV) to bring about behavior modification 
COGNITIVE THERAPY: focuses on the client’s thoughts rather than his/her feelings or behaviors; 
helps clients think realist ically and rationally in order to reinterpret events that otherwise lead to
distressing thoughts, feelings, behaviors 
Rational-emotive  behavior  therapy (REBT) – developed by Albert Ellis; emphasizes rational, logica l 
thinking; assumes that distressing feelings or symptoms are caused by faulty or illogical thoughts
3 processes interfere with healthy functioning:
1.	 Self-downing –  being critica l of oneself for  performing poorly or being rejected 
2.	 Hostility, rage – be ing unkind to or  critical of others for  performing poorly 
3.  Low frus tration tolerance – blaming everyone  or everything for “poor, dislikable conditions”
REBT is oriented toward solving problems direct ly. 
REBT Techniques 
•	 Help client  identify his/her  irrational beliefs 
•	 Argues with the client to he lp him / her confront the faulty cognitions that contribute to his / 
her distress 
•	 Role-playing 
•  Work through a series of techniques with the client  ABCDEF 
Activating Event  Beliefs  Consequences  Dispute  Effect  Further Action 
•	 Helpful with anxiety, assertiveness, unrealistic expectations 
•	 Not successful with psychotic disorders 
Aaron Beck – persistent irrational thoughts arise from cognitive distortions: systematic biases in the 
way a person thinks about events and people, including oneself 
•	 Cognitive  distort ions, automatic negative thoughts are learned / ma intained through

reinforcement

•	 Encourages clients to view beliefs as hypotheses to be tested, perform “experiments’ to
discover whether their be liefs are accurate 
5 common cognitive distortions: 
1.	 Dichotomous thinking (aka  black-and-white  thinking)  – allow for nothing in between the
extremes; you are e ither perfect or you are a piece of garbage 
2.	 Mental filter –  magnifying the engative aspects of something while  filtering out  the  positive 
3.	 Mind reading –  thinking you know exactly what other people are thinking, particularly as it 
relates to you 
4.	 Catastrophic exaggeration – thinking that you worst nightmare  will come  true  and that it  will 
be intolerable 
5.	 Control beliefs – believing that either you are helpless and totally subject to forces beyond
your control, or that you must tight ly control your life for feart hat, fi you don’t you will never
be able to regain contro l

Beck’s Cognit ive Therapy Techniques
Cognitive restructuring: the process of helping clients view their situation in a new  light , which then
allows them to shift the ir thinking away from the focus on automatic, distorted, negat ive thoughts to
more realistic ones 
•	 Clients make use of a da ily record of dysfunct iona l thoughts – (1) ident ify the  situation in 
which the automatic negative thoughts occurred, (2) rate their emotional state, (3) write down
the automatic thoughts and the cognitive distortions invo lved, (4) deve lop rational responses
to those thoughts, (5) rate the ir emotional state again (should improve)
To bring about cognitive restructuring, a cognitive therapist does the following:
1.	 Teach the client how to use the daily record of dysfunctional thoughts 
2.	 Help the client  identify his/her automatic negative thoughts 
3.	 Has the client examine and assess whether the automatic thoughts are accurate and whether
the client’s habitual ways of view ing him/herself and the world are on the mark 
4.  Helps the client search for alternative interpretations to refute those automatic thoughts
Psychoeducation: the process of educating clients about therapy and research findings pertaining to
their disorders or problems 
COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOR THERAPY: combination of cognitive and behavioral techniques within 
the same treatment 
Cognitive techniques change thoughts, which then affect feelings and behaviors.
Behavioral techniques change behaviors, which, in turn, lead to new experiences, feelings, and ways
of relating, which then change how people think about themselves and the world

BIOLOGICALLY BASED TREATMENTS 
Psychopharmacology: use of medication to  treat psychologica l disorders and problems 
Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders
Antipsychotic medication (aka  antipsychotics, neuroleptic medication): reduces psychotic symptoms 
(positive symptoms for schizophrenia – i.e.: hallucinations), but does not  cure the disorder 
First generation antipsychotics (aka traditional antipsychotics) –  first wave  of medications 
•	
developed to  treat schizophrenia (ex: Thorazine, Haldo l) 
•	 Tardive dyskinesia: caused by long-term use of antipsychotic meds; an irreversible
movement disorder in which the person invo luntarily smacks his/her lips, displays facial
grimaces, and exhibits other symptoms 
•	 Second generation antipsychotics (aka atypical antipsychotics): newer group of drugs that
affect the neurotransmitter dopamine as well as other neurotransmitters 
•	 Ex: Risperdal  cuts down on the  amount of free serotonin and dopamine available  in the 
brain, which affects the ease w ith which signa ls cross synapses; reduces posit ive
symptoms, allows psychotherapy to be more effective ; 
Side effects: hypergylcemia, diabetes

Mood Disorders 
Medications for Depression
Tricyclic antidepressants: for decades, this was the only effective antidepressant readily ava ilable;
affect serotonin levels; may take weeks to work; side effects = constipat ion, dry mouth,
blurred vision, low blood pressure (ex: Elavil)
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors: not w idely prescribed because they require strict adherence to a diet
without tyramine (in cheese, wine), can have potentially fatal changes in blood pressure; less
effective with typical symptoms of depression, marked by increased appet ite and increased
need for sleep
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: ex: Prozac, Zoloft , Paxil – fewer  side effects, associated with 
decreased sexual interest; “Prozac poop-out”  –  after taking the drug for a  while , people no
longer attain the same benefit; cause increased risk of suicide in children
Serotonin / Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors: ex: Serzone , Effexor , remeron 
St. John’s wort: extract from this flower effective as a short-term treatment to mild to moderately 
severe depression 
Placebo effect??

75 – 80% of the beneficia l effects of antidepressant medications can be achieved with a placebo.

Placebo effect is particularly strong for mild/moderate depression. 

Most positive response arises from expectations that symptoms will get better

From fMRI, we see that people on the placebos have similar changes in bra in functioning compared to

those on actua l medication.

The act of taking a (placebo) medication promotes biological changes that would not otherwise occur

were the person not taking medication. Moreover , the actua l medications do contribute to the overa ll

benefit, just not as strongly as initially believed.

Medications for Bipo lar Disorder

Mood stabilizers (ex: lithium, ant iconvulsant medications) can prevent / minimize the recurrence of

both manic and depressive phases.

Up to half of those  with bipolar disorder are not helped substantially by lithium  or cannot to lerate its

side effects (gastrointestinal problems, increased thirst, trembling)

Some people with bipolar disorder may be prescribed antidepressants for as short a period as  possible

because antidepressants can sometimes induce a manic episode in people w ith bipolar disorder.

To counteract mania , antipsychotics or antianxiety medications can be prescribed.

Anxiety Disorders (ex: panic disorder, phobias, PTSD) 
Benzodiazepines: reduce  symptoms of panic from an hour  up to  36 hrs (ex: Xanax, Va lium); side
effects: drowsiness, potentially letha l when taken with alcohol; tolerance , dependence , and
withdrawa l reactions can occur when taking benzodiazepines for months to years; only 
prescribed for short period of time
Ant idepressants (ex: TCAs, SSRIs, SNRIs) prescribed as long-term treatment for anxiety disorders;
need to be taken for several weeks before symptoms are not iceably reduced 
Electroconvulsive therapy: use  of an electric  current  to  induce  a  contro lled  brain  seizure  in  people
with disabling psycho logical disorders (ex: psychotic depression, manic episodes of bipolar disorder,
schizophrenia) or for whom medication has not been effective or recommended 
•  Patient is given muscle relaxant, general anesthesia  requires hospita l stay 
•  Can cause temporary memory loss 
•  Usage has increased over the years 
It’s not really known why ECT is so effective  in some people!

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation – an e lectromagnetic co il on the  scalp transmits pulses of high-
intensity magnetism to  the  brain in short  bursts lasting 100-200  ms; given to people who  have  not  
improved with medicat ion 
Has varying effects, depending on the  exact  locat ion of the  co il on the  head and the  frequency of the  
pulses 
Advantages: easy to administer (no anesthesia, hospitalization); minimal side  effects (slight headache) 	  
 
 
OTHER FORMS OF TREATMENT  
 
Moda lities:  
Individual therapy: individual client  treated by a  single  therapist 
Group therapy: a  number of clients with compat ible needs or goals meet together w ith a therapist; 
offer emot iona l support , psychoeducation, concrete strategies for managing the  problem  / 
disorder; provide members w ith an opportunity to learn about themselves, change  the ir 
undesired patterns of behavior ; interaction w ith other people who are  experiencing similar  
difficult ies decreases the sense of isolation and shame that  clients sometimes feel  
Family therapy: a family (or certain members of the family) is treated  
Systems therapy: views a client’s symptoms as occurring in a larger context or  system (the family / 
subculture) and a change in one  part of the system  affects the rest of the  system ; focuses on 
family structure , who  in the family has power and how  it  is used, ways that family members 
communicate with each other   
Self-help groups (aka support groups): members focus on a  specific problem  or disorder , don’t 
usually have a clinically tra ined leader 
•  AA – 1 st se lf-help program, 12  steps to recovery 
•  Smart Recovery; Depressive  and Bipolar Support  Alliance – other  self-he lp programs, not  
based on 12  steps  
Bibliotherapy: use  of self-he lp books and audio  and video  information for  therapeut ic purposes  
Some internet-based se lf-help programs can be  as effective as face-to-face therapy.    
 
Innovations in Psychotherapy 
Ecletic therapists: employ a variety of theoretical approaches and types of techniques  
•  Ex: combining ideas from psychodynamic theory, systems, therapy, and CBT   
Therapy protocols: detailed session-by-session manuals that provide  specific procedures and 
techniques to treat a particular  disorder from a  certain theoretical orientat ion 
•  Ex: using behavior therapy for panic disorder , cognitive  therapy for depression  
•  Provide more confidence that clients receive  the  right  type of treatment  
Interpersonal therapy: helps clients to  understand how  aspects of current  relationships can 
• 
affect their  mood and behavior, explore  consequences of client  actions in their  relationships, 
facilitate better personal communication 
o  Ex: for bulimia  
•  Provide brief therapy (12-20  sessions)  
 
Therapists are increasingly using techno logy in treatment (ex: virtual reality, communicating with 
therapist via e-mail, videoconference)  
1.  Self-monitoring: PDAs, smartphones set a larm signaling client to assess mood, anxiety, etc. 
2.  Reminding: PDAs, smartphones signal client  to employ previously learned technique  
3.  Delivering therapy: some  treatment programs are entirely e lectronic!  
a.  Internet-based CBT programs can decrease symptoms, but face-to-face treatment can 
help clients better understand the information, tasks

Issues in Psychotherapy Research 
Outcome Research: addresses whether, after psychotherapy, clients feel better, function better , live
more independently, or experience fewer symptoms 
Issues to consider when designing / conduct ing studies that evaluate the success of a  therapy: 
1.	 What to measure 
2.	 When to assess – immediately afterward? Month later? Year later? 
3.	 Appropriate control group – people  who rece ived treatment vs. people who did not 
a.	 Wait-list control group – contro l group made up of people who were on the waiting list 
for treatment 
Questions to keep in mind:
1.	 Are the participants randomly assigned to experimental and control groups? 
2.	 Are the members of the experimental and contro l groups comparable on re levant dimensions? 
3.	
Is a specific disorder be ing treated? 
4.	
Is the treatment based on a manual? If not, how can researchers ensure that therapists are
providing the type of therapy be ing investigated? 
5.	
 What types of outcome  measures are selected, who is assessing  the  outcome,  how  is  success  
defined? 
6.	
Is a follow-up assessment planned, and if so , at what interval of t ime after the end of treatment? 
Therapy, Medication, or Both?
Different treatments and techniques are most effective for different disorders. 
Depression
CBT, IPT effect ively reduce depression symptoms, no  side effects of drugs, skills and tools are learned,
less risk of re lapse .
Drawbacks of medicat ion: (1) if, after taking medication, a person’s depression lifts, s/he may stop
taking the medicat ion  relapse!  (2) side  effects can lead to discontinued use of medication 
Anxiety Disorders
Exposure (w ith response prevention) especially he lpful for treating most anxiety disorders that
involve fear or avoidance of specific st imuli by reducing symptoms  of  panic  and  avoidance  
Eating Disorders
Bulimia  CBT , IPT
Anorexic adolescents  family-based treatments 
Schizophrenia, Bipo lar Disorder
Medication is better than psychotherapy for reducing psychot ic and manic symptoms, lowering risk
of relapse. But , psychotherapy can: (1) he lp people accept need to take medication; (2) provide an
opportunity to learn new relationship skills after the medication has helped them to be more stable; (3)
help to  ident ify triggers of the psychot ic, manic, or depressive episodes, which in turn can help 
prevent relapses
CBT can a lso reduce posit ive  symptoms of schizophrenia in people who are not he lped by medication,
decrease like lihood of relapse 
CAVEAT: As with all research that examines groups of people, the research findings on
outcomes of various types of treatments do not necessarily apply to a part icular individual. Thus, for
any particular person with a given disorder, one type of therapy may be more effective than another,
which in turn may be more effective than medication (or vice versa)
