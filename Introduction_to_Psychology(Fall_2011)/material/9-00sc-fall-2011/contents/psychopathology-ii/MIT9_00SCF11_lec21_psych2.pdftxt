MetaMeta --Analysis
Analysis
• Quantitative method for averaging results of
a large number of different studies. 

• Unit of analysis is the effect size, arrived at by 
subtracting the mean of the control group
from the mean of the treatment group and
dividing that different by the standard
deviation of the control group.

• The larger the effect size, the greater the
effect of therapy.

Effectiveness
(Smith, Glass, & Miller, 1980)
(Smith, Glass, & Miller, 1980)
• The average person (50th %ile) receiving 
psychotherapy was better off than 80% of the 
persons who did not receive therapy.

• Only about 10% of effect sizes were negative (cid:198)
deterioration due to psychotherapy was 
infrequent.

• Different types of therapy were equally effective, 
but some advantage to cognitive and behavioral 
therapies.

unnoticed in young - rare to have first episode after 
60
• women 2 or 3 times the rate of men
• about 70% who have an episode will have another

Treatment for Depression

• medications (27 million people in US 
2005, $9.6 billion in 2008 sales)
• CBT

39

Current Treatment for 
Depression is Suboptimal

• Only partially effective
As many as ½ of patients do not achieve 
remission (Petersen et al., 2005)
Residual symptoms are common among 
patients achieving remission (Nierenberg, 
1999)
• Trial and Error
Selecting correct treatment takes months, 
causing attrition

Treatment for Depression
recent meta-analyses
• Kirsch – no effect of drug (above placebo, about 75% 
of effect) – apparent difference is due to patients 
realizing they are on active drug from side effects –
greater side effects associated with better drug 
response (80% of patients guess correctly they are 
on drug) – no drug/placebo difference if placebo 
causes side effects

• Fournier – little or no drug benefit above placebo for 
mild-to-moderate  or severe depression; benefit for 
patients with very severe depression

ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER

(ADHD/ADD)
(ADHD/ADD)
• INATTENTION

• HYPERACTIVITY (80%)

• IMPULSIVITY

• DIAGNOSIS  by exclusion

• PREVALENCE  2 million in US 
tripled since 1981
increased 2.5 times since 1990

46

How Do Clinicians Make The 
Diagnosis?

– History from parents and physical exam 
– Collection of data from school and 
parents using questionnaires

47

Prevalence of ADHD

– Ranges from 1.7 to 16.1% in various studies
– Different diagnostic methods have been used 
to establish the prevalence
– Different DSM manuals - DSM III, DSM IIIR, and 
now DSM IV
– Different settings - by country, by profession
– Wolraich – same German population, 
incidence changed from 6 to 12% DSM 3R to 
DSM 4

48

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD)
(ADHD)
• PREVALENCE: 3 - 5% of school-age children

• Impairs social and academic adjustment in childhood
- predicts antisocial behavior, substance abuse
and adverse occupational and social adjustment in  adulthood

• TREATMENT:  Stimulants, e.g. methylphenidate (Ritalin) 

• ETIOLOGY: genetic 
- rates among relatives of probands - 7 times 
- twin studies - .76 heritability
- candidate genes - dopaminergic

49

DIAGNOSTIC  CRITERIA
DIAGNOSTIC  CRITERIA

• INATTENTION (> 6 for at least 6 months to a degree 
that is maladaptive and age-inappropriate)
- careless mistakes in schoolwork or other activities
- difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play
- does not seem to listen when spoken to directly 
- does not follow instructions or finish tasks 
- difficulty organizing tasks and activities
- avoids tasks engaging sustained mental effort
- loses things
- easily distracted by extraneous stimuli
- forgetful in daily activities

50

• HYPERACTIVITY-IMPULSIVITY (> 6 for at least 6
months to a degree  that is maladaptive and 
age-inappropriate)
Hyperactivity
- fidgets or squirms in seat
- leaves seat in classroom 
- runs about or climbs excessively
- difficulty playing quietly
- is “on the go” or acts as if “driven by a motor”
- talks excessively
Impulsivity
- blurts out answers before questions are completed
- difficulty awaiting turn
- interrupts or intrudes on others’ conversations
or games

51

• Symptoms present before age 7 years

• Symptoms present in 2 or more settings (home/school)

• Diagnosis by exclusion of following:
- pervasive developmental disorder 
- sensory deficits
- allergies
- psychiatric conditions that “mimic” ADHD 
e.g., depression
• Subtypes -
- Combined-type - both inattention 
and hyperactivity-impulsivity
- Inattention-type - inattention only
- Hyperactive-impulsive -
hyperactivity-impulsivity only

Questions
Questions

• Does brain function differ in ADHD and
control children?
• Do brain regions involved in inhibitory control function
differently in children with ADHD?
• Does Ritalin have different effects on brain 
function in ADHD and control children?
• Treatment by stimulants (e.g. Ritalin) 
• Brain changes that mediate effectiveness are unknown
• Effects in control children are unknown

how should people pursue happiness?

• height and human growth hormone?
(men, 5’9”; women 5’4”)
• sadness to depression?
• shyness to social anxiety disorder?
• failure to follow directions to ADHD?

• use of stimulants to enhance performance – 7% of 
university students? 20% of scientists in on-line poll

• ethics – what is the right thing? also fairness, freedom,
