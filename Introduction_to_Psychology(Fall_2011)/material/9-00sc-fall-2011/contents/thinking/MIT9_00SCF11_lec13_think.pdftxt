Two train stations are 100 miles apart.  At 
2pm one Saturday afternoon the two trains 
start toward each other, one from each 
station.  One train travels at 60 miles per 
hour, the other at 40 miles per hour.  Just as 
the trains pull out of their stations, a bird 
springs into the air in front of the first train, 
and flies ahead to the front of the second 
train.  When the bird reaches the second 
train, it turns back without losing any speed 
and flies directly toward the first train.  The 
bird continues to fly back and forth between 
the trains at a rate of 80 miles per hour.  How 
many miles will the bird have flown before 
the trains meet?

Picture a large piece of paper, 1/100th of an 
inch thick.  In your imagination, fold it once 
(now you have two layers), and continue 
folding it over on itself 50 times.  It is true 
that it is impossible to fold any actual piece 
of paper 50 times.  But for the sake of the 
problem imagine that you can.  About how 
thick would the 50-times-folded paper be?
Adapted from Glass, A. L., and K. J. Holvoak. Cognition. Random House, 1985.

Buddhist monk problem
Buddhist monk problem
One morning, exactly at sunrise, a Buddhist monk 
began to climb a tall mountain.  A narrow path, no 
more than a foot or two wide, spiraled around the 
mountain to a glittering temple at the summit.  The 
monk ascended at varying rates of speed, stopping 
many times along the way to rest and eat dried fruit 
he carried with him.  He reached the temple shortly 
before sunset.  After several days of fasting and 
meditation he began his journey back along the same 
path, starting at sunrise and again walking at variable 
speeds, with many pauses along the way.  His 
average speed descending was, of course, greater 
than his average climbing speed.  Show that there is 
a spot along the path that the monk will occupy on 
both trips at precisely the same time of day.

Suppose you are a doctor faced with a patient 
who has a malignant tumor in his stomach.  It 
is impossible to operate on the tumor, but 
unless the tumor is destroyed the patient will 
die.  There is a kind of ray that can be used to 
destroy the tumor.  If the rays reach the tumor 
all at once at a sufficiently high intensity, the 
tumor will be destroyed.  Unfortunately, at this 
high intensity the healthy tissue that the rays 
pass through on the way to the tumor will also 
be destroyed.  At lower intensities, the rays are 
harmless to healthy tissue, but they will not 
affect the tumor either.  What type of procedure 
might be used to destroy the tumor with the 
rays, and at the same time avoid destroying the 
healthy tissue?

A dictator ruled a small country from a fortress.  The fortress was 
situated in the middle of the country and many roads radiated 
outward from it, like spokes on a wheel.  A great general vowed to 
capture the fortress and free the country of the dictator.  The general 
knew that if his entire army could attack the fortress at once it could 
be captured.  But a spy reported that the dictator had planted mines 
on each of the roads. The mines were set so that small bodies of men 
could pass over them safely, since the dictator needed to be able to 
move troops and workers about, however, any large force would 
detonate the mines.  Not only would this blow up the road, but the 
dictator would destroy many villages in retaliation.   A full-scale direct 
attack on the fortress therefore seemed impossible.

The general, however, was undaunted.  He divided his army up into 
small groups and dispatched each group to the head of a different 
road.  When all was ready he gave the signal, and each group 
charged down a different road.  All of the small groups passed safely 
over the mines, and the army then attacked the fortress in full 
strength.  In this way the general was able to capture the fortress.

Imagine that the U.S. Department of 
Transportation has found that the Ford 
Explorer is eight times more likely than a 
typical family car to kill occupants of 
another car  in a crash.  The German 
government is considering restricting 
sale and use of the Ford Explorer.  Do 
you think sales of the Ford Explorer 
should be banned in the Germany? Do 
you think the Ford Explorer should be 
banned from being driven on German 
streets?

Card Sorting 
• perseveration (motor parallel)
• role of inhibition in selection of actions
• mental flexibility
utilization behavior & ventromedial lesions –

Lesions –– Relation 
Relation 
Orbitofrontal
of Thoughts and Emotions
of Thoughts and Emotions
1. Phineas Gage

2. Orbitofrontal patients
• GSR is measure of autonomic response –
related to sweat – emotional reactivity –
used for lie detection
• no GSR in response to faces of family 
members vs. strangers (opposite of 
prosopagnosic patients)
• no GSR in response to emotional relative to 
neutral pictures 
• disconnection between thought and emotion

75

Risk Taking
Risk Taking
• low immediate rewards but positive long-term 
rewards vs. high immediate rewards but higher long-
term loss (delayed gratification)
• two decks of cards – pick a card and win or lose $$$$
Pile A – win $50/lose $100
Pile B – win $100/lose $1250
• controls select Pile A over time
• orbitofrontal patients select Pile B
• GSR – goes up as somebody picks up a card – for 
controls, GSR was large when selecting from risky 
Pile B – no anticipatory GSR for patients –
disconnection between thought and emotion
• same pattern for injuries at 15 months & 3 months 
when tested as adults
