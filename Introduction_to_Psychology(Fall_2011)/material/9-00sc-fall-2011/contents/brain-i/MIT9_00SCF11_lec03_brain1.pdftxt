rational soul in brain - part of the mind 
nearest to the heavens 

Aristotle 
warm and active heart houses the mind 
cool and inert brain cools the blood 

Galen 
brain - mind in fluid filled ventricles

THE BRAIN 
Neuronal Computational Elements 

1.  	 glia & neurons 

2.  	 neuron 
• soma = cell body = grey matter 
– 
• axon = output = white matter 
– 
• dendrite = input 
– 
• synapses & neurotransmitters 
– 
• collection of cell bodies = nucleus 
– 
• collection of axons = tract 
– 

THE BRAIN (cont’d)


3. CNS has about 1,000,000,000,000 neurons & 1,000,000,000,000,000 
synapses; 62,000 miles of myelinated axons; 100,000 miles of dendrites 

4.  up to 15,000 connections per cell 
•  average neuron may have about 1,000 synapses 
•  average axon may synapse on about 1,000 neurons 

5.  each of the 100 billion neurons may have the processing capacity of a 
medium-sized computer - computes about 1000 multiplications and 
additions every 10 msec 

6.  time for information to go from one neuron to another about 10 msec -
slower than millions of operations per second by fast computers - but 
billions of such neuronal computers yields massively parallel processing 
in the brain

LOCALIZATION & 

PHRENOLOGY

•	 Franz Gall (1758-1828) 
•	 Johann Casper Spurzheim (1776-1832) 

good neuroanatomists 
•	 cortex is composed of cells connected to subcortical 
structures 
•	 crossing of the pyramidal tracts & gray/white matter in 
spinal cord 
•	 symmetrical hemispheres connected by commissures 

not so good neuropsychologists 
•	 behavioral phrenology - amativeness, combativeness, 
acquisitiveness 
•	 Gall - language localized to below the orbit due to a soldier 
with a knife wound that penetrated left frontal-lobe and 
become aphasic

"The famous physiologist, Magendie, 
preserved with veneration the brain of 
Laplace.  Spurzheim had the very natural 
wish to see the brain of a great man.  To 
test the science of the phrenologist, Mr. 
Magendie showed him, instead of the brain 
of Laplace, that of an imbecile.  Spurzheim, 
who had already worked up his enthusiasm, 
admired the brain of the imbecile as he 
would have admired that of Laplace." 
Flourens, P. "Psychologie Comparee." (1865).

Phineas Gage

•	 age 25 in 1848 
•	 "a well-balanced mind, and was looked upon by
those who knew him as a shrewd, smart
business man, very energetic and persistent in
executing all his plans of operation" (Harlow) 
•	 made a foreman and regarded by his superiors
as "the most efficient and capable in their
employ" 
•	 September 13, 1848 in Cavendish, VT 
tamping iron - 3 ft 7 in long, 1.25 inches in 
•	
diameter at larger end, 13.25 pounds 
•	 went through his head, landed 30 yards away 
•  March, 1849 - back at work.  "His contractors... 

considered the change in his mind so marked

that they could not give him his place again"

"The equilibrium or balance, so to speak, between his
intellectual faculties and his animal propensities, seems to 
have been destroyed.  He is fitful, irreverent, indulging at 
times in the grossest profanity (which was not previously his 
custom), manifesting but little deference for his fellows,
impatient of restraint or advice when it conflicts with his 
desires, at times pertinaciously obstinate, yet capricious and
vacillating, devising many plans of future operations, which
are no sooner arranged than they are abandoned in turn for 
others appearing more feasible.  A child in his intellectual 
capacity and manifestations, he has the animal passions of a
strong man.  Previous to his injury, although untrained in the 
schools, he possessed a well-balanced mind and was looked
upon by those who knew him as a shrewd, smart business 
man, very energetic and persistent in executing all his plans 
of operation.  In this regard, his mind was radically changed,
so decidedly that his friends and acquaintances said he was
‘no longer Gage’." (Harlow, 1868)

•	 Jean Baptiste Bouillaud (1796-1881) argued for left-
sided control of speech in 1825 
•	 Marc Dax in 1836 reported that in a series of cases
disorders of speech followed left hemisphere lesions
- published by his son in 1865 
•	 Ernest Auburtin (Bouillaud's son-in-law) reported to
the Anthropological Society of Paris in 1861 a case
"who had lost his speech but understood everything
said to him . . . his intelligence is still unimpaired,
and speech is wholly abolished... based on the
symptoms that he presents, we have diagnosed
softening of the anterior lobes" 

•	 Paul Broca (1824-1880) heard speech 
•	 5 days later received a patient, LeBorgne, who
had lost his speech, could only say "tan" and
utter an oath - right-sided paralysis - otherwise 
apparently normal 
•	 Tan died on April 17, 1861 and the next day
Broca reported to the Anthropological Society of
Paris left anterior focus of Tan's lesion - by 1863 
8 more cases. "in which the lesion was in the 
posterior third of the third frontal convolution.
This number seems to me to be sufficient to give
strong presumptions.  And the most remarkable 
thing is that in all the patients the lesion was on
the left side.  I do not dare draw conclusions 
from this.  I await new facts.“ 
•	 Broca's aphasia - inability to speak despite 
presence of intact vocal mechanisms and
normal comprehension

Broca’s aphasia: 
• results from damage to Broca’s Area 
(e.g., lesions) 
• unable to create grammatically-
complex sentences 
• speech described as telegraphic, 
contains content words only 
• comprehension is relatively normal

Mystery of the corpus callosum

1. Gustav Fechner - 19th century - would a divided 
brain lead to separate stores of mood,
predisposition, knowledge, memory? 
2. William McDougall - a founder of British 
Psychological Society - unity of consciousness does 
not depend upon continuity of nervous system -
volunteered for commissurotomy if he got incurable
disease 
3. 	 Erickson - 1940 - spread of epileptic discharge from 
hemisphere to hemisphere by corpus callosum 
4. 	 1957 
- "corpus callosum is hardly connected with 
psychological functions at all... it is for
transmitting seizure activity from one hemisphere
to the other" (Warren McCullough) 
- "to keep hemispheres from collapsing into one 
another" (Karl Lashley)

PROTOTYPICAL CALLOSOTOMY  

RESULTS


1. patient fixates centrally 
picture of cup in RVF - says "cup" – 
picture of spoon in LVF - reports seeing nothing – 
picks spoon with left hand - what was it? "pencil" 
speech production from LH  only in most patients 
some language comprehension in RH 
2. 	 mutual unawareness - modularity 
present square to LVF, triangle to RVF -
draw with unseen left hand - draws a square -
what did you see? "a triangle" 
3.  	 somesthesis 
no cross retrieval of objects 
no cross replication of hand postures 
no cross localization of fingertips 
4.  	 different modes of information processing of the same stimulus in the two 
hemispheres 
- LH matched by function 
- RH matched by appearance 
- LH analyzes local elements  

- RH analyses global elements


PROTOTYPICAL CALLOSOTOMY  

RESULTS (cont’d)


5.  unity of consciousness usually good in daily life 
- picture of nude woman in LVF - patient blushes, giggles - why 
laughing? "Oh doctor, you have some machine!" -

some exceptions - one hand pulling up pants and the other pulling 
down - angry at wife, one hand forcibly reaching for her, right 
hand grabbed left to stop it - another patient "I open the closet.  I 
know what I want to wear.  As I reach for something with my right
hand, my left comes up and takes something different.  I can't put
it down if it's in my left hand. I have to call my daughter." -
another patient working in father's grocery store would stock
something into shelf with one hand and remove it with the other 

present "walk across room" in LVF - subject gets up, walks across 
room - "why did you walk across room?" - "I was thirsty" 

PS - pairs of pictures in VFs - pick 2/8 in free vision that are related to 
presented pictures - sees claw in RVF, snow scene in LVF - rh 
points to chicken, lh to shovel - "I saw a claw and I picked the 
chicken, and you have to clean out the chicken shed with a 
shovel."
