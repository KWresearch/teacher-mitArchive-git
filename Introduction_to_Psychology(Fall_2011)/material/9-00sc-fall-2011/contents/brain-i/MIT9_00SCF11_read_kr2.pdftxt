KOSSLYN CHAPTER 2 – The Biology of Mind and Behavior: The Brain in Action 

Events at the level of the brain can influence many aspects of behavior , in ways not immediately
apparent. 
BRAIN CIRCUITS: MAKING CONNECTIONS 
The Neuron: A Powerful Computer
The physical characteristics of the bra in give rise to: 
•	 Mental contents: knowledge, beliefs (including ideas, explanations, and expectations), desires
(such as hopes, goals, and needs), and feelings (such as fears, guilts, and attractions) 
•	 Mental processes –  sets of operations that work together  to carry out a  function, such as 
attention, perception, or memory
All brain activity hinges on the workings of neurons – ce lls that  receive  signals from sense  organs or
other neurons, processes these signa ls, and sends the signals to muscles, organs, or other
neurons; the basic unit of the nervous system.
Neurons are  like computers: They accept  inputs (typically 100s of signals at the same time), operate on 
them, and produce outputs (signals that are  transmitted). 
3 types of neurons: 
Sensory neurons – neurons that respond to signals from sensory organs and transmit those 
•	
signals to the brain and spina l cord 
•	 Motor neurons – neurons that send signa ls to muscles in order to control movement (and also
to bodily organs, such as glands) 
Interneurons – neurons that are connected to other neurons, not to sense organs or muscles 
•	
A large number of neurons work together to accomplish any part icular task. Neurons are organized
into brain circuits –  sets of neurons that work together to  receive  input, operate on it  in some
way, and produce specific output .  
Structure of a Neuron: The Ins and Outs 
 See p. 44 , Figure 1 for the Major Parts of a Neuron 
Cell body – centra l part of a neuron (or other cell), which contains the nucleus; controls the cell’s
metabolic act ivities and integrates inputs
Cell membrane – the “skin” that surrounds the  cell 
Axon –  the  sending end of the  neuron; the  long cable-like structure extending form the cell body;
conducts the nerve impulse away from the cell body 
•  Axons can be branched, allows neurons to send a message to more than one place at a t ime 
•  Each neuron only has 1 axon
Terminal button –  structure at  the  end of the branch of an axon that can re lease chemica ls into the 
space between neurons when their neuron has been triggered
Dendrite – the tree like  art of a neuron that  receives messages from the axons of other neurons or from 
the environment 
Neural Impulses: The Brain in Action
The inputs and outputs of neurons are chemicals! 
Neurons are either at rest or they are sending signals – outputs – to  other neurons. 
When at rest , they maintain a negative charge within them ; this negative charge is the
Resting potentia l – arises because of how ions are distributed inside  and outside the cell. 
•	 During rest, more positively charged ions (consist ing most ly of sodium ions) are outside the 
neuron than are  inside  it, and more negatively charged ions are  inside the neuron than are in
the surrounding fluid.

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 2 – The Biology of Mind and Behavior: The Brain in Action 

A neuron “fires” when the dendrites (and in some cases, the cell body) receive appropriate inputs
from other neurons. When this occurs, very small pores (channels) open in the  membrane  that  covers
the axon. When these channe ls open, a complex exchange of ions occurs, with some ions flowing into
the ce ll from the surrounding fluid and some ions flowing from inside the cell to the surrounding 
fluid. 
1.	 Na+ channe ls open after the neuron is stimulated, and Na+ ions rush into the cell; the  inside
of the cell then becomes positive ly charged. 
2.	 The Na+ channels close, K+ channels briefly open, and K+ ions go outside the cell. The K+
ions are pushed out because of the addition of the posit ive ly charged Na+ ions. 
3.	 Na+ pumps actively push Na+ ions back outside, and K+ ions are drawn inside until the
inside and outside concentrations are returned to their origina l leve ls. 
4.	 When the ion exchanges reach the end of the axon, they cause chemicals to be released from 
the termina l buttons. 
Action potential – the shifting change in charge that moves down the  axon (i.e.: steps 1 – 4 ) 
•	 All-or-none  law – states that if the neuron is sufficiently stimulated, it  fires,  sending  the  action
potentia l all the way down the axon and re leasing chemicals from the termina l buttons; either
the action potential occurs or it doesn’t 
Most axons are covered in myelin  – fatty substance that helps impulses efficiently trave l down the 
axon 
•	 Multiple sclerosis (MS) –  mye lin deteriorates, so  action potentials “stumble” as they move 
down the axon 
Neurotransmitters: Bridging the Gap
Synapse – the  place where  an axon of one neuron sends signals to the membrane  (on a dendrite  or cell
body) of another neuron; the synapse includes the sending portions of an axon, the rece iving
portions of the receiving neuron, and the space between them
Synaptic cleft – gap in the synapse between the axon of one neuron and the membrane of another 
across which communication occurs 
1.	 Action potential reaches the end of the axon 
2.	 Synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft 
a.	 Neurotransmitter substance – chemical that carries a signal from the terminal button of 
1 neuron to the dendrite or cell body of another 
3.	 Neurotransmitters bind to receptors and the action potential is transmitted 
Chemical Messages: Crossing the Gap
Neurotransmitter mo lecules are conta ined in small sacs (vesicles). 
 See p. 47, Table 1 for Major Neurotransmitter Substances  
•	 Acetylcholine 
•	 Dopamine 
•	 Noradrenaline 
Serotonin 
•	
•	 GABA 
•	 Endogenous cannabino ids –  neurotransmitter substances re leased by the  receiving neuron
that then influence the activity of the sending neuron 
o	 Function: fine-tune  act ivity  underlying  learning,  memory, pain perception, attention 
o	 Found in: marijuana 
Receptors : On the Receiving End
Once they cross the synaptic cleft, neurotransmitters will affect different types of receiving neurons in
different ways.

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 2 – The Biology of Mind and Behavior: The Brain in Action 

Each neuron has receptors –  specialized site on a dendrite or ce ll body where a neurotransmitter
molecule attaches itself, like a lock that is opened by one key, a receptor rece ives only one type
of neurotransmitter. 
2 general types of effects of neurotransmitter binding:
1.	 Excitatory  inputs – the receiving neuron is more likely to have an action potent ial 
2.	
Inhibitory inputs –  the  receiving neuron is less likely to have an action potentia l 
a.	 The excitatory and inhibitory inputs to each rece iving neuron add up or cance l one
another out , and only when their sum total is large enough will an action potential be 
init iated 
Reuptake –  process by which surplus neurotransmitter in the  synaptic cleft is reabsorbed back into
the sending neuron so that the neuron can effectively fire again 
Unbalanced Brain: Coping with Bad Chemicals 
Agonist – chemica l that mimics the effects of a neurotransmitter by activating a type of receptor
Other drugs can increase  the amount of a neurotransmitter  in the synapse , sometimes by slowing
down its reuptake . 
•  Ex: depression is treated with selective serotonin-reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs)  – block the 
reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin (Prozac, Zoloft , Paxil are SSRIs)
Antagonist – chemical that  blocks the effect of a neurotransmitter 
Parkinson’s Disease – evidence  of connection between  neurotransmitters  and  behavior  
•	 Caused by death of cells that produce dopamine 
•	 When given L-dopa  (drug that helps produce dopamine), symptoms decrease , but L-dopa 
becomes less effect ive with continued use 
Neurotransmitters are used widely throughout the brain, so their disruption would create more 
widespread difficulties 
Glial Cells: More Than the Neurons’ Helpmates
The average human brain conta ins 10x as many glial ce lls as neurons.
Glial cells –  type of cell that helps neurons to  form  both synapses and connections when the brain is 
developing, influences the communicat ion among neurons, and generally he lps in the “care
and feeding” of neurons 
•	 Physically cushion neurons 
•	 Clean up the remains of dead neurons 
•	 Dispose of extra neurotransmitters and ions in the fluid surrounding neurons 
•	 Provide nutrients to neurons 
Neurons and Glia: A Mutually Giving Relationship
Neurons have synapses with glia l ce lls, stimulate  glial cells to re lease specific chemica ls
Glial cells can direct ly regulate how strongly one neuron affects another 
Glial cells coordinate the act ivity of vast sets of brain circuits
Glial cells can prod neurons to form additional synapses 
Glial Networks : Another Way  to Think and Feel?
Glial cells do not produce action potentials. They communicate by passing chemicals directly through
their walls to adjo ining glia or by releasing (into brain fluid that surrounds the ce lls) mo lecules
that affect both neurons and other glia. Chemicals released by one glial cell can induce other
glial cells to re lease chemica ls   ripple effect!
We’re st ill not entirely sure what glial networks do, but we know that they are important for a w ide
range of brain functions.

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 2 – The Biology of Mind and Behavior: The Brain in Action 

THE NERVOUS SYSTEM: AN ORCHESTRA WITH MANY MEMBERS 
The Peripheral Nervous System: A Moving Story 
2 parts of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS): 
1.	 Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) – controls the smooth muscles in the body, some glandular
functions, and many of the body’s self-regulating activities, such as digestion and circulat ion 
•	 Contro ls activit ies not under conscious control 
1.	 Sympathetic Nervous System –  part  of the ANS  that readies an animal to fight or  to
flee by speeding up the heart , increasing breathing rate to deliver more oxygen,
dilating the pupils, producing sweat , decreasing salivat ion, inhibiting activity in the 
stomach, and relaxing the bladder 
2.	 Parasympathetic Nervous System –  part  of the ANS  that  is “next to  the  sympathetic
nervous system and that tends to counteract  its effects (ex: slows down heart rate ,
contracts the pupils, increases salivation, stimulated digestion, and contracts the 
bladder) 
Sympathetic nervous system tends to affect a ll the organs at the same time.
•	
Parasympathetic nervous system tends to affect organs one at a time or in small 
groups. 
2.	 Sensory-Somatic Nervous System  (SSNS)  – part of the PNS that consists of the neurons in the
sensory organs (such as the eyes and ears) that convey information to the brain as well as
neurons that actually trigger muscles and glands 
a.	 Somatic Motor System – consists of nerves that are attached to muscles that can be 
used vo luntarily (striated muscles) 
The Central Nervous System
2 parts of the Central Nervous System (CNS): 
1.	 Spinal cord –  flexible rope of neurons and their connections that runs inside  the  backbone
(spinal co lumn) 
2.	 Brain 
The Spinal Cord: Getting Inside the Backbone
The spinal cord is organized into 2 large tracts:
1.	 1 runs along the front side (facing forward) –  sends the  bra in’s commands to the body 
2.	 1 runs along the back side (facing backward) – registers informat ion about the body and 
conveys that to the brain
At each of 31 places, each tract is connected to eh body by a pair of spinal nerves, one that goes to the
left side of the body, and one that goes to the right side .
The spinal cord can initiate some aspects of our behavior. 
•	 Ex: reflex –  automatic behavioral response to an event; a llows you to respond immediately, 
bypassing the brain for more efficient signal-response 
o	 Why do we need interneurons then? 
Interneurons allow the brain to send signals to prevent a reflex response 

The Visible Brain: Lobes and Landmarks 
Meninges –  three  protective  layered membranes that cover  the  brain
Cerebral hemisphere –  a left  or right half-bra in; shaped roughly like a sphere 
•	 Each hemisphere rece ives information from , and controls the muscles of, the opposite side  of 
the body 
4 lobes: 
1.  occipital 
2.  temporal 
3.  parietal 
4.  frontal

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 2 – The Biology of Mind and Behavior: The Brain in Action 

Corpus callosum – large bundle  of axons that connects the  2 halves of the  brain 
Cerebral cortex – the  convo luted pinkish-gray outer layer of the brain where more mental processes 
arise; 2 mm thick; contains the cell bodies of neurons; aka gray matter 
Sulci –  creases in the  cerebra l cortex 
•	
•	 Gyri –  bulges between the  sulci in the  cerebral cortex 
•  The cortex is crumpled up so that more of it can be stuffed into the skull 
Subcortical structures – parts of the brain located under the cerebral cortex; a lso conta in gray matter 
Spotlight on the Brain: How It Divides and Conquers
Brain system – set  of brain circuits that work together to  accomplish a  particular task 
The Cerebral Cortex: The Seat of the Mind 
Occipital Lobes: Looking Good
Occipital lobes – brain lobes at the back of the head; concerned entire ly with different aspects of 
vision 
•	 Most of the signals from the eyes arrive at these lobes 
•	 Contain many separate areas that work together to characterize properties of viewed objects
(ex: shape , color, motion) 
•	 Damage here can cause part ial / complete blindness 
If the left occipital lobe  is removed, you won’t be able to see things in the right visual fie ld 
•	
Temporal Lobes: Up to Their Ears in Work
Temporal lobes –  brain lobes under  the temples, in front  of the ears; among its many functions are
processing sound, entering new information into memory, storing visual memories, and
comprehending language 
Parietal Lobes: Inner Space 
Parietal lobes –  brain lobes at the top, rear of the brain; among their functions are  attention,
arithmet ic, touch, registering spatial location 
Somatosensory strip – gyrus immediately behind the central sulcus; registers sensations on 
the body and is organized by body part 
o	 Larger areas of this gyrus correspond to areas of the body that are more sensitive (ex:
lips, hands) 
Frontal Lobes: Leaders of the Pack 
Compared to the monkey bra in, the human bra in has much larger fronta l lobes
Frontal lobes –  bra in lobes located behind the  forehead; critically invo lved in planning, memory
search, motor contro l, speech control, reasoning, emotions 
•	 Motor strip – gyrus immediately in front of the central sulcus; contro ls fine movements and is
organized by body part; aka primary motor cortex 
o	 Larger areas are dedicated to parts of the body that we control with precision (ex:
hands, mouth) 
Phineas Gage – metal bar through the front part of his head. 
•	 Previously, he had been responsible and organized; afterward, he led a disorderly life. 
•	 Couldn’t stick to a decision; little self-control; profane language 
The Dual Brain: Thinking with Both Barrels 
Split-Brain Research: A Deep Disconnect
The most compelling evidence that the 2 half-brains perform distinct functions has come from looking 
at the effects of severing the corpus callosum.

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 2 – The Biology of Mind and Behavior: The Brain in Action 

Split-brain patient – person whose corpus callosum has been severed for medica l reasons, so that
neura l signals no  longer pas from one cerebral hemisphere to the other 
•	 Procedure often done  to help patients w ith severe , otherw ise  untreatable epilepsy – disease 
that causes massive uncontro lled neural firing in parts of the brain, leading to bodily
convulsions 
The left half of each eye sends signals to  the  left  hemisphere ; the right half of each eye  sends signa ls to
the right hemisphere . Normally, this information quickly crosses over to the other hemisphere, so the
entire brain receives signals from both halves of each eye. However, when the corpus callosum is cut,
the signal stays in the hemisphere that initially receives the information. 
Experiment: present pictures / words to only the left or right side of space 
•	 Gazzaniga & LeDoux (1978) –  presented a picture of a snow  scene  to the right hemisphere 
(contro lled left hand; spatial attention; processing nonverbal cues) and at the same time, a 
picture of a chicken’s claw to the left hemisphere (controls right hand, speech, reasoning) 
o  The split-bra in pat ient then had to select pictures that were related to these stimuli 
 Right hand (controlled by left hemisphere): selected chicken picture 
 Left hand (controlled by right hemisphere): selected shove l picture 
Speech: said he saw the claw , picked chicken; made up a story to reason why

shovel was chosen 
Hemispheric Specialization: Not Just for the Deeply Disconnected 
You can’t simply say that the left bra in is verba l / analyt ical; right brain is perceptual / intuitive 
•	 Ex: left brain is actua lly better than the right at some aspects of interpreting sensory
information; right brain is actually better than the left at some aspects of language
When the hemispheres differ in their functions, they typically differ in their abilities to eprform very
narrow, specific tasks. 
Beneath the Cortex: The  Inner Brain 
 See p. 59, Figure 12 for Key Subcortical Brain Areas 
Forebrain –  cortex, tha lamus, limbic system , basal ganglia 
Thalamus : Crossroads of the Brain 
“switching center”  messages are received, redirected to the appropriate destination 
•	
Sensory systems (ex: vision, hearing), motor systems that contro l muscles have connections 
•	
here, before rout ing to other parts of the bra in 
•	 Role in controlling sleep, attention 
Hypothalamus: Thermostat and More 
Sits under the thalamus 
•	
•	 Critical for mainta ining bodily functions – eating, drinking, body temperature, blood pressure, 
heart rate; governs sexual behavior ; regulates hormones 
Hippocampus: Remember It 
•	 Looks like a “seahorse” 
•	 Plays a key role  in a llow ing us to enter new  information into the brain’s memory banks 
•	 H.M. – bilateral removal of hippocampus to control epilepsy; could no longer learn new facts 
o	 Memory for events that occurred a year or so before the operation seemed normal, but
he was stuck at that stage of his life . 
o	 Was not part icularly aware of deficit 
•	 Although the hippocampus itse lf does not permanently store memories, it triggers processes
that store new information e lsewhere in the brain

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 2 – The Biology of Mind and Behavior: The Brain in Action 

Amygdala: Inner Feelings 
“almond” shaped 
•	
•	 Plays a specia l role  in strong emotions, ex: fear, anger 
•	 Affects whether a person can correctly interpret emotions in facial expression 
Limbic System – hippocampus, amygdala , hypothalamus 
Basal Ganglia: More than Habit Forming 
•	 Posit ioned on outer sides of thalami 
Involved in planning and producing movement 
•	
•	 Play a centra l role  in forming / learning habits (NOT  learning  facts!)  
•	 Relies on dopamine 
o	 People with Parkinson’s Disease often have abnormal functioning of the ir basal ganglia 
•	 Nucleus Accumbens – part  of the  basa l ganglia ; also  needs dopamine for operation 
o	 Plays a crucia l ro le in the brain’s response to reward, anticipation of reward 
o	 Drugs like cocaine, amphetamine , a lcohol a ffect the nucleus accumbens 
Brainstem: The Brain’s Wake-Up Call 
•	 Medulla – lowest part of the brainstem; important in automatic control of breathing, 

swallow ing, blood circulation

•	 Reticular formation – 2  main parts: 
o	 Reticular activating system – plays a key ro le in keeping you awake; making you perk
up when something interest ing happens 
o	 Other part – receives input from the hypothalamus; plays a key ro le in producing ANS 
reactions; involved in conducting impulses from muscles not under voluntary contro l
to those under voluntary contro l 
•	 Pons –  bridge connecting the medulla and midbrain; connects the  upper parts of the brain to
the cerebellum ; invo lved with a variety of functions, ranging form regulation of sleep to 
control of facia l muscles 
Cerebellum: Walking Tall 
•	 Physical coordination, est imating time, paying attention 
•	 The surface area of the cerebellum is nearly the same size as that of the entire cerebral cortex 
Hindbrain – medulla, pons, cerebellum, parts of the reticular formation 
Midbrain – grouping of the remaining brainstem structures 
The Neuroendocrine and Neuroimmune Systems: More Brain-Body Connections
The brain has a total of 4 mechanisms that directly affect the body:
1.	 Somatic motor system – moving muscles voluntarily 
2.	 Autonomic nervous system – regulates invo luntary muscles, heart 
3.	 Hormones –  the  brain produces hormones, contro ls production of hormones e lsewhere  in the 
body 
4.	
Immune responses – the brain makes us more or  less able to fight off the onslaught of disease , 
repairs damage to the body from injury 
The Neuroendocrine System: It’s Hormonal!
Hormones –  chemicals that  are produced by a  gland and can act as a neurotransmitter substance;
affect organs of the body, thoughts, feelings, behaviors 
Neuroendocrine system –  makes hormones that affect many bodily functions; provides CNS  with 
information 
 See p. 62, Figure 14 for The Major Endocrine Glands

Important hormones: 
•	 Testosterone 
•	 Estrogen 
•	 Cortiso l 
Pituitary gland – “master gland” that regulates other glands, but is itse lf contro lled by the brain,
primarily via connections from the hypothalamus 
The Neuroimmune System: How the Brain Fights Disease
Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrena l  (HPA)  axis  –  system is activated by stress, injury, and infection and 
that works to fight off infection 
•	 Produces cortisol, but too much cortisol can interfere with immune system (i.e .: being stressed
out can make you more like ly to catch a co ld, etc.); damage the brain / hippocampus (interfere 
with storing new  information in memory) 
PROBING THE BRAIN 
The Damaged Brain: What’s Missing?
The first evidence that different parts of the brain do different things came from accidents in which
people suffered damage to the brain
Lesion – region of impa ired bra in tissue 
Stroke - most frequent  cause of brain damage; occurs when blood fails to  reach part of the brain
(usually because a clot clogs up a crucial blood vessel), and thus neurosn in the affected area
die 
Researchers study pat ients w ith brain damage to learn which specific abilities are disrupted. 
Recording Techniques: The Music of the Cells 
Electroencephalograph –  machine that records electrical activity in the bra in
Electroencephalogram  (EEG) –  tracing of brain waves of e lectrical fluctuation over t ime 
•	 When neurons fire together, the electric fields they produce can be detected by electrodes
placed on the sca lp. 
Magnetoencepha lography (MEG) – technique  for assessing brain activity that relies on recording
magnetic waves produced by neural activity 
•	 Neural firings also produce magnetic fields that can be detected. 
•	 Good for recording very fast changes in neura l firing 
Neither EEG nor MEG is very sensitive to activity in subcortical brain structures 
Single-ce ll recording – technique in which tiny probes (microelectrodes) are placed in the bra in and 
used to record neural firing rates 
Neuroimaging: Picturing the Living Brain 
Visualizing Brain Structure
Computer-assisted  tomography  (CT  or  CAT)  – neuroimaging technique that produces a 3D image  of 
brain structures using X-rays
Magnet ic resonance imaging (MRI) – technique that uses magnetic properties of atoms to take sharp
pictures of the 3D structure of the brain

The more frequently neurons fire , the more blood, oxygen, and nutrients they require . The amounts
of these substances in a particular part of the bra in indicate how vigorously neurons in that region are 
firing 
Positron emission tomography (PET) – neuro imaging technique that uses sma ll amounts of a 
radioactive substance to track blood flow or energy consumption in the bra in (radioactive
substance is taken up into different brain areas in proportion to how vigorously the neurons in
each area are firing 
Functional magnet ic resonance imaging (fMRI) – type of MRI that detects the amount of oxygen being
brought to particular places in the brain, which indicates how active those neurons are 
All neuroimaging techniques provide evidence for correlations between performing a task and 
activat ion of a specific bra in region. They do not establish that activated brain regions play a 
causal role in producing the behavior. To make this connection, we need other techniques! 
Stimulation: Inducing of Inhibiting Neural Activity
1.	 Open skull, apply mild electric current delivered directly to parts of exposed cortex, report
what person experiences while current is be ing applied 
a.	 Wilder Penfield pioneered this method; people experience different images, memories,
feelings depending on the area in the bra in that is stimulated 
b.	 Results are difficult to interpret because rwe can’t be sure whether actual memories are 
activated, whether new experiences are being crea ted at the time , or even whether the
person is making up stories 
c.	 Alternatively, you can observe which act ivities are disrupted when current is applied 
i. 	 This is limited because stimulating particular neurons can activate other ones,
etc. etc. 
d.	 Nevertheless, advances in microstimulation of nonhuman animals have allowed us to
stimulate a few neurons at a time and observe the  direct consequences on an animal’s 
percept ions, decisions, and act ions 
2.	 Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) – technique  in which the  bra in is stimulated from
outside by putting a coil on a person’s head and delivering a magnet ic pulse (or series of 
magnetic pulses); the magnetic fields are so strong that they make neurons under the co il fire 
a.	 When neurons are repeatedly stimulated in this way, they become temporarily
unresponsive. By showing that temporarily disrupting a part icular brain area  in turn
temporarily disrupts a part icular type of behavior, TMS lets us show that a brain area
plays a causal role in a particular type of mental processing 
Each of these  techniques have strengths and weaknesses! 
 See p. 69, Table 2 for Key Characterist ics of Various Techniques Used to Study Brain Function 
GENES, BRAIN, AND ENVIRONMENT: THE BRAIN IN THE WORLD 
Genes as Blueprints : Born to Be Wild?
Mendelian inheritance – the transmission of characteristics by individual elements of inheritance
(now known to be genes), each acting separate ly 
Gene – stretch of the DNA molecule that produces a specific prote in
Genotype – genet ic code w ithin an organism 
Phenotype –  observable structure and behavior  of an organism

Tuning Genetic Programs: The Environment Matters
Genes provide  the blueprints for building ce lls and govern the way the brain is w ired up before birth.
But they cannot program the ent ire brain in advance! The brain will eliminate the connections
that turn out not to be useful. 
 The  wiring of the  bra in depends partly on the  genes and partly on experience.
Pruning – process whereby certain connections among neurons are e liminated 
•	 Connections that are used frequently are retained, while others that are not used frequently
are pruned away.
Interactions w ith the environment not only se lect among connections established by the genes but can 
also cause new connections to form . 
Plast icity –  the  brain’s ability to change  as a  result of experience ; pruning and adding new
connections; most evident  during: 
1.	
Infancy, childhood 
2.	 When the body changes so that the sensory input  changes (ex: amputating a limb) 
3.	 When we learn something new or store new information 
4.  As compensation after bra in damage
Adult bra ins are not as plastic as the brains of children 
•	 The adult brain loses plasticity with age because the functions of neurons and brain circuits
become set in place with experience 
In some regions, though, adult brains can create new neurons 
•	
Our genes specify the range of what is possible , and the environment then operates to set up the brain
within this range. 
Genes and Environment: A Single System
Interactions w ith the environment cause many genes to be turned on and off, and when they are

turned on, they have specific effects on your body and bra in.

By regulat ing brain act ivity, genes affect behavior

Genes and the environment are different aspects of a single system. 

Environment and Genes: A Two-Way Street 
Passive interact ion – occurs when genetically shaped behavioral tendencies of parents or siblings
produce an environment that is passively rece ived by the child
Evocative (or reactive) interaction –  occurs when genetically influenced characterist ics (both
behavioral and physical) induce other people to behave in particular ways
Active interaction –  occurs when people  chose , partly based on genetic tendencies, to put  themse lves
in specific situations and to avoid others 
Behavioral Genetics – the field in which researchers attempt to determine the extent to which the
differences among people’s behaviors and psycho logical characterist ics are due to  the ir
different genes or to differences in their environments 
Heritability, Not Inheritability 
Heritability – the degree to which the variability of a characteristic or  ability in a  population is due to
genetics – given a specific environment 
If the environment were different , the heritability might be different as well. 
•	
Twin Studies: Only Shared Genes? 
•	 Compares ident ical and fraternal tw ins to determine the relat ive contribut ion of genes to
variability in a characterist ic or ability 
Identical (monozygotic) tw ins have virtually identical genes; fraternal (dizygotic) tw ins share 
only as many genes as any other pair of siblings

Twin studies have shown that the amount of gray matter in the brain is more similar in identical
twins than in fraternal twins, which suggest that the amount of gray matter, is in part, under genetic
control. (ex: frontal lobes; temporal lobe involved in language comprehension) 
Adoption Studies: Separating Genes and Environment? 
•	 Characteristics of children adopted at birth are compared to those of their adoptive parents or
siblings versus the ir biologica l parents or siblings 
•	 Especially powerful for twins separated at birth, growing up in different environments 
o	
It is always difficult to separate genetic from environmental influences 
Evolution and the Brain: The Best of All Possible Brains? 
Evolution – gene-based changes in the characteristics or abilit ies of members of a species over
successive generations 
Natural Selection: Reproduction of the Fittest
Natural selection – occurs when individuals with inherited characteristics that  contribute to  survival 
have more offspring, and over t ime those characteristics come to be widespread in a
population
Adaptation –  an inherited characteristic that  increases an organism’s ability to  survive and reproduce
successfully 
Evolution via natural se lection tends to mold the characteristics of a group of organisms to the 

requirements of their environment.

Important principles:

•	 Environment 
•	 Variat ion 
•	 Random variat ion 
Not Just Natural Selection 
Always exercise caution when trying to use the idea of natura l se lection to expla in our present-day
characteristics. Just because a characteristic exists doesn’t mean that it is an adaptation to the
environment or that it is the result of natura l selection.
