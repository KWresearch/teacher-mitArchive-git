- remote memory spared in amnesia
-- hippocampus not the long-term site of memory storage
2. Shrinking retrograde amnesia
- Link between anterograde and retrograde amnesia

MEMORY III

• Memory Systems
specific neural networks that 
record, retain, and retrieve 
particular kinds of memory

Memory System

• particular neural network

• specific mnemonic process

Measures of Memory

Explicit (direct)
Implicit (indirect)
• Recall                                        
• Skill learning
• Repetition priming
• Cued Recall
• Conditioning

DECLARATIVE/PROCEDURAL 
MEMORY DISTINCTION
Declarative Memory
• directly accessible to conscious recollection
• facts and episodes
• knowing that

Procedural Memory
• accessible only through performance
• knowing how

SKILL LEARNING

• Improved performance 
(accuracy, speed) with 
practice on a motor, 
perceptual, or cognitive 
task
