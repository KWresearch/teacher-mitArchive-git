***** Session Overview *****
                What conditions can impair your memory? How is your memory affected by these
                impairments? In this lecture, we will study amnesia, how it can influence our
                memory systems and how amnesia patients have helped us pinpoint areas in the
[Cartoon of     brain crucial to memory. A particular highlight of this session is Prof.

just been       amnesiac patient H. M.
'amnesiacked.'] Keywords: memory systems, amnesia, anterograde amnesia, retrograde amnesia,
                hippocampus, Huntington's disease, patient H.M., declarative memory,

***** Discussion: Memory *****
So, if the essential task of a memory system is to carry information forward in
time, what properties should that system have? Think about the memory devices
you use in everyday life: A USB stick, a post-it note, your mind, etc. What do
they need to be able to do?â¦Â Read_more_Â»
***** Check Yourself *****
Name, describe and give examples of the two types of explicit memory and the
three types of implicit memory.
âº View/hide answer
The three types of explicit memory are semantic memory and episodic memory.
Semantic memory is our facts and general knowledge about the world. The three
types of implicit memory are procedural memory, priming, and learning through
conditioning. Procedural memory consists of or motor and cognitive skills, or
know how to do certain things. Priming is enhanced identification of objects
and words, or changes in behavor as a result of recent experiences. Learning
through conditioning is learning to expect rewards or punishment under certain
conditions.
Examples of each type of memory:
Semantic: The sky is blue, dogs have fur, Africa is below Europe.
Explicit Memory: What you had for breakfast, your first date, what you did for
your birthday.
Procedural: How to hit a baseball, how to do simple arithmetic, how to start
your car.
Priming: Seeing a river and someone says they are going to the bank. Priming
will make it more likely for you to think they are going to the bank of a river
or stream rather than a bank to withdraw money.
Learning through conditioning: After several years in elementary school you
learn to associate a good report card with the expectation of a reward, such as
cookies or a new toy from your parents.
