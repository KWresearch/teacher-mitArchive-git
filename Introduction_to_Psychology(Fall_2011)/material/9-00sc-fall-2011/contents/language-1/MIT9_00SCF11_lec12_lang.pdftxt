LANGUAGE

Professor John Gabrieli

LANGUAGE
• Comprehension
Auditory
Visual
• Production
Speaking
Writing

Endlessly generative - 100 trillion years to 
memorize all the sentences we can 
produce

LANGUAGE
• Phonology - sounds of language
• Syntax (grammar, structure)
• Semantics (meaning)
• Pragmatics

Discourse
Emotional Comprehension/Production

PHONOLOGY
• Phonemes are building blocks of 
speech sounds (boy vs. toy)
• Humans use 100 phonemes - 45 in 
English (26 letters; letters are not 
phonemes - “hot” and “cold”)
• born to hear all phonemes - use or lose 
it in development after 6/8 months
• we can understand 250 words/min -
normal rate is about 180 words/min = 14 
phonemes/second in continuous stream

Spectrogram from sentence “John said that the dog snapped at him.”

Note that the gaps between sounds generally occur within the words, 
rather than between words.

These waveforms are identical except for an inserted 100ms silent gap, yet we 
hear two different words.

10’s of milliseconds can determine which syllable we hear

Many speech sounds (phonemes) differ only by brief spectral 
and/or temporal changes, specifically within 10’s of 
milliseconds

lead consonant

the following 
vowel

problem of 
invariance

Spectrographs for /b/ and /d/ syllable families:
• The /b/ sounds in bet and bird are perceived 
similarly, yet spectrographs are quite different.
• The /b/ and /d/ sounds in bet and debt have 
similar spectrographs, but are perceived as 
different phonemes.

CATEGORICAL PERCEPTION
Many different sounds must be 
categorized into phonemes & words

CATEGORICAL PERCEPTION
Categorical Perception
speech sounds vary continuously

-20    -10    0    10    20    30    40    50    60    70     80

… but we perceive them in categories

-20    -10    0    10    20    30    40    50    60    70     80

“BA”

”PA”

VOICE ONSET TIME (VOT)

• VOT = length of time
from when a consonant is
released to when voicing 
begins 
(vibration of vocal cords)

• negative VOT = vocal
cords vibrate before 
stop is released

SYNTAX
• structure of sentence
• “The model embraced the designer and 
the photographer …...”
“The model embraced the designer and 
the photographer laughed.”

SEMANTICS
• meaning of word or sentence
• morphemes are smallest unit of 
meaning
“Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.”
“Fastly eat dinner, ballgame start soon.”

a positive, but two positives don’t make a 
negative.” “Yeah, yeah”)

INFANTS & LANGUAGE 
• sucking on a nipple (rate)/habituation
• within 2 hours of birth, chose mother’s voice 
over another voice (had not heard mother after 
birth) 
• 3-day olds preferred language to other 
sounds like music
• 4-day olds noticed French/Dutch distinction
• 2 months phonemic distinctions (ba/ga), 
preference for own language
