KOSSLYN CHAPTER 6 – Language, Thinking, and Intelligence: What Humans Do Best 
LANGUAGE: More than Meaningful Sounds 
Language Production: the ability to use words, phrases, and sentences to convey information 
•	 Generative  we  can arrange  words in countless new combinations to produce nove l sentences;
not just retrieving / repeating stored sentences 
Language Comprehension: the ability to  understand the messages conveyed by words, phrases, and 
sentences 
Language consists of simple building blocks that can be combined in many ways according to specific 
rules: 
•	 Phonology 
Syntax 
•	
Semantics 
•	
•	 Pragmatics 

PHONOLOGY: the structure of the sounds of the words in a language 
Phonemes: basic building block of speech sounds; sma ll, basic sound from a fixed set that specifies
the building blocks of speech sounds that humans are capable of producing 
•	 Humans can produce 100 phonemes  English only uses 45 of these 
SYNTAX: the  internal organization of a  sentence determined by a set of rules (grammar) for
combining different parts of speech into acceptable arrangements; rules for how words can be 
organized into sentences 
•	 Vs. Grammar : rules that specify how different parts of speech (ex: nouns, verbs, adjectives) can 
be combined to form sentences 
•	 Ex: Noun + Verb 
•	 When you read, you organize the material in terms of the syntax of the sentences 
SEMANTICS: the meaning of a word, phrase, or sentence 
Morphemes: smallest unit of meaning in a  language 
•	 Ex: adding prefixes, suffixes, -ing, -ed  
•	 There are rules governing how morphemes can be combined, but morphemes can be

combined in many ways to create many , meaningful words. 

Meanings are often assigned arbitrarily to different sounds or written words. 
•  Ex: who decided that the word “dog” refers to a dog? What if “dog” really referred to cat? 
The meaning of a sentence and its syntax are distinct  different parts of the bra in are involved in 
processing semantics and syntax. 
Ex: good syntax, bad semantics –  Colorless green ideas sleep furiously. 
•	
•  Ex: bad syntax, good semantics –  Fastly dinner  eat , ba llgame soon start; Yoda  speech 
Syntax and semantics can interact! Sentences are easiest to understand when named objects appear in
the same order in the sentence as they do in the corresponding event 
PRAGMATICS: the ways that words and sentences in a language convey meaning indirectly, by
implying rather than asserting 
•	 Plays a key role  in understanding humor and metaphors (direct comparisons of 2 things in
which one is described as being the other)

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 6 – Language, Thinking, and Intelligence: What Humans Do Best 
Phonology, syntax, and semantics depend primarily (in right-handed people) on the  left cerebra l 
hemisphere, but the ability to understand metaphors, as we ll as humor , depend crucia lly on the
brain’s right hemisphere. 
 These 4 aspects of language constantly  interact!! 
Bilingualism

Are there differences in how first and second languages are acquired and used?

Kim et al. (1997) – used fMRI to scan brains of 2 groups of bilingual people while they thought about

what they had done the previous day, using each of the ir two languages in turn.

2 Groups = learned 2nd language  as young children vs. as adults 
•	
Brain area  involved  in  comprehension  (back  part  of  the  left  temporal  lobe)  – activated in same 
•	
way w ith both languages, in both groups 
•	 Other brain areas behaved different ly for those who had learned the  language as young
children than for those who had learned the  language as adults. 
o  Evidence that language was processed differently by those who learned it as adults. 
People who  learned 2nd language as an adult had activat ions in part of the left fronta l lobe
(invo lved in working memory) 
o	 Language  learned during childhood is “automat ic,” it doesn’t require “thinking
through what you are saying,” whereas language  learned as an adult does require such
extra effort. 
The rate of learning new vocabulary words in a 2nd language  is remarkably close to  the  learning rates 
of children who are reading in the ir native languages. 
Grammar / phono logy are not easily picked up in a 2nd language. 
People with good musical ability can learn to pronounce words in another language better than
people who do not have good musical ability. 
The more formal education you have and the younger you are when you start, the better you will be
at learning a 2nd language.

MEANS OF THINKING: The Mental Tool Kit 
Mental Images: mental contents like those that arise during perception, but they arise from stored 
information rather than on immediate sensory input 
 Thinking relies on mentally manipulating information, and information is stored in various ways 
Words: Inner Speech and Spoken Thoughts 
John B. Watson –  thinking is just talking to yourse lf 
• 
Problems with this idea: 
o	 Words are ambiguous, thoughts are not. 
o	 We sometimes have trouble putt ing thoughts into words… if thoughts were already formed in
language , expressing them should be easy! 
o	 Animals can think, but they don’t use language? 
Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis: the  idea that language  shapes our perceptions and thoughts, and
thus people who speak different languages think differently 
•	 Championed by Benjamin Lee Whorf

Eleanor Rosch: tested linguist ic re lativity hypothesis by studying Dani (remote tribe in Papua New 
Guinea) 
Expt : people who speak languages w ith lots of different words for colors should perceive
more distinctions among co lors than people who speak languages with few such words? 
FALSE  Dani use only 2  words for  color , but they perceive variations in co lor and
o	
can learn shades of color as readily as people who speak languages w ith words that
label many colors
Language does not entire ly shape our percept ions thoughts.

We can use words as a crutch to help us think, especially w ith working memory tasks.

Language can enhance memory.

The written version of a language may affect thought .

Ex: English speakers think of time as horizontal; Chinese think of time as vertical 
Mental  Imagery  “seeing with  the mind’s eye” 
VISUAL MENTAL IMAGERY 
•  Relies on many of the same parts of the brain (92%) as are used in visual perception
3 Properties:
1.	 Spatial Extent  how much an object extends over a specific portion of space 
•	 Tested by visua l scan 
•	 Patterns of activation in the brain specify the  shape, co lor, and spatial extent of objects 
•	 Many of the areas of the brain that process visua l input are organized so that the 
images on the ret ina are la id out on the cortex in topologically organized areas 
 When people visualize with their eyes closed, these areas in the occipital and 
parietal lobes usually are active 
If such areas in the occipital lobe are temporarily impaired by TMS, people

have difficulty forming visua l mental images 
2.	 Limited S ize  your field of view spans only a certain angle (spread) 
•	 Bigger objects need to be “seen”  farther away to  fit in it  (ex: e lephant  vs. rabbit) 
•	 Why? Objects in visual mental images overflow at about the same spatial extent that
actual objects seem to become blurred in perception. 
 Because our eyes only have limited scope , our brains needed only to process
that limited fie ld of view , and this property also affects our mental images. 
3.	 Limited Reso lut ion  limited level of dist inguishing fine details (if an object is too sma ll, you
have trouble dist inguishing all of its parts) 
•	 People need more time to “see” propert ies of objects that are visualized at small sizes
than those visua lized at larger sizes 
•	 Can be explained by topographica lly organized brain areas: The brain areas used in
percept ion evolved to process  what  the  eyes  send  them,  and  our  eyes  have  only  a  
limited reso lut ion. 
 Think of an HDTV! 
Other types of imagery: auditory, motor , spatia l, manipulating (ex: rotating objects 90 degrees) 
In each of these cases, imagery re lies on bra in mechanisms used  for  other  purposes  (ex:  
•	
percept ion, contro lling movement) 
Limitations of mental images as vehicles of thoughts 
•	 Abstract concepts (ex: just ice) 
•	 Ambiguity in images 
•	 Not everyone can produce good images 
Concept: the idea  that  underlies the meaning of a  word  or  image,  depending  on  the  language,  some
concepts can be expressed w ith a single word or may require a phrase or two to be fully expressed 

Please pardon any spelling errors or typos!

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 6 – Language, Thinking, and Intelligence: What Humans Do Best 
•	 Must be unambiguous; can be concrete or abstract 
•	 Can be expressed by words and images, but they are not the  same  as the  other! 
Aristotle  a given concept is defined by a set of features 
Ex: concept = bird; features = feathers, wings, beak, ability to fly 
•	
Problems: features can be unclear (especially for abstract concepts); makes wrong predictions;
•	
concepts are not “all-or-none”! 
Some concepts fit better to certain objects over others (ex: “bird” applies better to robin
o	
than emu) 
o	 How well a concept applies depends on an entity’s typicality: the degree to  which an 
entity is representative of a concept 
Prototype: the  most typical example  of a  concept 
•	 A concept is specified as a set of features that describe the prototype. 
•	 Only a percentage of those features need to be present in any particular member or in order to
apply the concept . (Ex: Emu has enough “bird features” to fit the “bird concept”) 
Some types of concepts are not stored as prototypes. Rather , they are stored as sets of examples of the
concept or as functions 
Concepts are organized in terms of specificity, and when classifying an object or event, we typically 
use a concept at the basic level: an intermediate  level of specificity that is usually the  most  likely to be
applied to an object (usua lly has more genera l concepts above it and more specific concepts below it);
is as general as possible , which still being limited to the object in quest ion
Ex: apple (has fruit above it; Granny Smith below it) 
Rosch  ways to  identify the basic leve l: 
Similarity of shapes of the members of concepts at different levels of specificity

PROBLEM SOLVING AND REASONING: From Mental Processes to Behavior 
Problem: an obstacle that must  be  overcome  to reach a  goa l
Problem Solving: devising a way to overcome an obstacle that stands between the present situat ion
and a desired goal
Reasoning: deciding what fo llows from an idea, ideas, or a situat ion 
Representation problem: the challenge of how best to formulate the nature of a problem 
Functional f ixedness: when so lving a problem, getting stuck on one interpretation of an object or one
aspect of the situation 
Finding the right representation for a problem can be tricky because once you think of a problem in a
certain way (mental set), you may find it difficult to drop this view and try out others. 
Strategy:  an approach to solving a problem , which indicates the  processing steps to be tried 
Algorithm: a set of steps that, if fo llowed methodically, will guarantee the solut ion to a problem 
Heuristic: a  rule-of-thumb  strategy  that  does  not  guarantee  the  correct  answer  to  a  problem  but  offers
a likely shortcut to it
Ex: break the  problem into parts, work backwards, guess and check
Solving problems by analogy: comparing features of 2 situat ions and noticing what they have in
common / what is different 
 See p. 210, Table 1 for a summary of Approaches to Problem Solving 
Other Ways to Improve Your Ability to Solve Problems:
1.	 Represent the problem effectively / understand the problem 

Please pardon any spelling errors or typos! 

4 

9.00 EXAM 2 NOTES 
KOSSLYN CHAPTER 6 – Language, Thinking, and Intelligence: What Humans Do Best 
2.	 Focus on the problem (don’t get so set on finding the solut ion that you forget what the
question is asking!) 
3.	 Don’t restrict the resources (a form of functional fixedness) 
4.	 Consider a lternat ive types of solutions (different mental sets: an approach to solving a
problem that worked for a similar problem in the past, which leads to a fixed way of thinking
about how to solve a present problem) 
5.	 Take a fresh look 

•	

LOGIC, REASONING, AND DECISION MAKING 
Logic: a  set  of  rules  that  determines  which  conclusions  fo llow  from  particular  assumptions
Deductive reasoning: reasoning that applies the rules of logic to a set of assumptions (stated as 
premises) to discover  whether  certain conclusions follow  from  those assumptions; goes from
general to the particular 
•  General principles (premises)  Specific example  to which principles (premises) apply 
Conclusions based on application of genera l principles to specific example 
Inductive Reasoning: reasoning that uses examples to discover a rule that governs them; goes from
the particular (examples) to the genera l (a rule) 
•	 Observation of individual examples  Notice of regularities in specific examples  Induct ion 
of general principles 
LOGICAL ERRORS 
Affirming the consequent: assuming that a specific cause  is present because a  particular result has 
occurred 
Confirmation bias: tendency to seek information that w ill confirm a  rule, and not  to seek information 
that would refute the rule 
IMPORTANT  Wason and Johnson-Laird Card Task: “If a  card has a vowe l on one side, 
then it will have an even number on the other side .” 
o	 The cards are : A D 4 7. How many / which ones do you flip over to decide if the rule is
true? 
o	 Answer: A and 7 
o	 Most people flip A to see whether an even number is on the other side (confirms rule) 
o	 Not many people pick 7 . If there  is a vowel on the other side of 7, then the rule is
wrong no matter what’s on the reverse of A (refutes rule) 
PROBLEMS WITH HEURISTICS 
Representativeness heuristic : strategy in which we assume  that  the  more  similar  something is to a
prototype stored in memory, the more likely it is to belong to the prototype’s category 
•	 Often invo lves ignoring the base-rate rule: if something is chosen from a set at random , the
chances that the thing will be of a particular type are directly proportional to the percentage of
that type in the larger set 
•	 Alternatively, people just have trouble understanding descriptions of probabilities. 
Availability heuristic: tendency to judge objects or events as more likely, common or frequent if they
are easier to retrieve from memory 
•	 Ex: words that start with k vs. words with k in the 3rd posit ion? 
o	 People think there are more words that start with k, but  this is wrong!  It  is just  easier  to
retrieve from memory words start ing with k than words that have k in the 3rd posit ion. 
•	 Expt : Redelme ier et a l. (2003): colonoscopy  patients judged the  overall pa in of the

procedure on the basis of the most available part of the procedure (most recent part)

Many people think that emotion clouds reasoning and distorts our ability to be object. But in fact ,
researchers have found that sometimes emotions can actually help reasoning.

•  Having a hunch (correlated w ith skin-conductance responses) he lps in gambling games??
Other times, emotions (ex: fear , anger) can disrupt reasoning. 
If you are agitated, working memory is disrupted; reasoning is more difficult to accomplish 
•	

INTELLIGENCE: the ability to reason and so lve problems we ll and to understand and learn complex 
material 
•	 Depends on ability to adapt to environment? 
Performing quickly and accurately 
•	
BINET & SIMON: intelligence  test as an objective way to  ident ify children in public schools who 
needed extra classroom help 
•	 Variety of tasks – copy a draw ing, repeat  numbers, recognize co ins / make  change, etc. 
•	 Performance on tests should reflect educational experiences 
•	 Compared performance relative to “normal” children at various ages to assign mental age (MA) 
•	 Children w ith mental age less than chronological age  were considered slow 
TERMAN & WECHSLER: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Sca le: most  wide ly used intelligence  test;
consist of both verbal subtests and performance (nonverbal) subtests 
4 parts  see p. 217, Table 2 for WAIS-IV Subtests with Simulated Examples of Questions 
1.	 Verba l comprehension 
2.	 Perceptual reasoning (nonverbal) 
3.	 Working memory 
4.	 Processing speed (nonverbal; focusing attent ion to use information quickly) 
WILLIAM STERN: developed idea of an inte lligence quotient (IQ) 
[(Menta l Age) / (Chrono logical Age)] * 100 
•	
•	 Average = 100 
•	 Problem: mental age does not keep deve loping forever, chronological age does 
Intelligence tests are no  longer scored by using the MA/CA ratio . Instead, IQ is computed by

comparing a part icular person to the average of other people of the same age .

Average is still 100 .

How  this is done:

•	 Standardized Sample : a  representative  selection of people , drawn from  a carefully defined 
population 
•	 Norming: the process of sett ing the mean (i.e.: 100) and the standard deviation (degree to
which the individual scores can deviate from the mean while still be “average”… ~ 15 po ints)
of a set of test scores, based on results from a standardized sample 
Intelligence Quotient (IQ) : a score  on an intelligence test, originally based on comparing mental age
to chrono logical age, but later based on norms and used as a measure of intelligence 

Reliable – produces consistent results 
Valid –  measures what it  is supposed to measure 
IQs predict performance in the rea l world 
•	 Higher IQs = higher GPAs; more success; higher-prestige jobs; earn more money; more stable 
marriages; stay out of jail 
•	 HOWEVER, not everybody who is successful at work has a high IQ; not all people with high
IQs are successful

Success also depends on: personality traits of conscientiousness and integrity; motivation, 
ambition, education; culture / values 
ANALYZING INTELLIGENCE 
Spearman’s g Factor
Posit ive correlations among scores on different types of mental tests indicate the existence of a single 
underlying intellectual capacity, labeled “g” for general factor. 
Factor analysis: a  statistical method that uncovers the particular characteristics (factors) that  make
scores more or less similar; the more similar the scores, the more strongly implicated are 
shared underlying factors.
Specific factor : “s”  = aspects of performance that are particular to a  given kind of processing 
•  Evidence for s: there is a wide variation in the sizes of the correlations between scores on 
individual tests 
When you perform a task, you are draw ing on g as well as on a particular type of ability s, which is
specific to the task. Some tasks rely more on g than  on  s . 
IQ scores depend mostly on g ; how  intelligent you are overall depends on how much of this general 
intellectua l capacity you have. 
Thurstone’s Primary Mental Abilities
Intelligence consists of 7 separate primary mental capacities: fundamental abilities that are the 
components of intelligence and are distinct from other abilities
Ex: verbal comprehension, spatial visualization 
Catelli and Horn –  Fluid and Crysta llized Intelligence 
Fluid Intelligence: underlies the creation of novel solut ions to problems; ability to reason without
relying heavily on previously learned knowledge or procedures 
•	 Ex: ability to reason about novel situations and to  solve novel problems; ability to abstract
concepts on the basis of new information or procedures; ability to use reasoning that does not
depend primarily on learning and acculturation; ability to manipulate abstract concepts, rules, 
and generalizations and to use logical relations
Crystallized Intelligence : re lies on know ing facts and having the ability to use  and combine them ; 
relies on using experience and on learned procedures to reason (ex: general skills that have 
been deve loped (i.e.: crystallized) from exercising  fluid g in the past) 
•	 Ex: ability to reason using previously learned procedures; ability to use factual know ledge
acquired through education and experience ; ability to use reasoning that is based on learning 
and acculturation; ability to use language to communicate 
As we age, crystallized intelligence does not suffer much, but fluid intelligence deteriorates  we  still

mainta in our expertise in an area, but the ability to shift gears quickly to so lve new problems tends to

decrease.

Two different intelligences develop at different rates during childhood; rely on different brain

structures; are not equally heritable .

Different facets of academic achievement are predicted by the 2 forms of intelligence.

Carroll’s Three-Stratum of Cognitive Ability

Relations among test scores are neatly structured into a 3-striate hierarchy  top is g , next  are 8  broad

cognitive abilities (which include fluid and crystallized intelligences), and under each of those broad

cognitive abilities is a set of narrow abilities.

Each of the broad abilit ies re lies on g, and each of  the broad abilities is, in turn, drawn on by narrow

abilit ies.

Performance on any specific task requires factors in all 3 tiers.

Grand synthesis of earlier theories  most w idely accepted theory
