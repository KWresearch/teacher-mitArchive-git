***** Discussion *****
Language is just incredible â think about how easy it is for us, as babies,
to learn our native language effortlessly, and yet how hard it is, once weâve
already learned a language, to learn anotherâ¦ Read_more_Â»

**** Short Answer Questions ****
1) Language is a system of communication and representation that is governed by
systematic rules. The rules of can be studied at multiple levels. For each of
the following terms, identify the features of language they describe:
   1. Syntax
   2. Semantics
   3. Phonology
âº View/Hide Answers
Â 
   1. Syntax: The description of how words are organized into phrases and
      sentences. Often called the "grammar" of a language.
   2. Semantics: The description of the meaning of words, phrases, and
      sentences.
   3. Phonology: The description of the sounds of a language and how they are
      put together to make words.
      Â 
      Â 
2) Language is a powerful system because of the principle of discrete infinity,
which means that a small number of basic units can be combined in an unlimited
number of ways to represent and communicate ideas.
   1. What is the smallest unit of meaning in language called? Give an example
      of how these can be combined.
   2. What is the smallest contrastive unit of sound in language called? Give
      an example of one of these from English. Give an example of one of these
      from a foreign language you might have heard, but which is not present in
      English.
âº View/Hide Answers
Â 
   1. Morpheme. For example: Un + believe + able = unbelievable
   2. Phoneme. For example: /k/ as in "cat" in English. In other languages but
      not English, e.g., the trilled "r" in Spanish, the clicks in Bantu, the
      trilled "r" in French, the hard "h" in Hebrew.
Â 
Â 
3) It is remarkable that babies learn language so fast and so effectively, even
though no one ever explicitly teaches them the rules of their language.
Describe two facts you have learned about how babies learn language.
âº Sample Answers
    * Girls learn more words earlier than boys.
    * Babies begin to lose the ability to discriminate foreign language speech
      sounds by 9-12 months.
    * Children might use words wrong in overextensions (e.g. calling all
      animals "doggie") or underextensions (refusing to call any other dog
      besides the family pet a "doggie").
