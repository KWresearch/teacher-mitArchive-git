KOSSLYN CHAPTER 5 – Memory: Living With Yesterday 
Memory Re lies on 3 Fundamental Types of Processing:
1.	 Encoding: the process of organizing and transforming incoming information so  that  it can
be entered into memory, either to be stored or to be compared w ith previously stored
information 
2.	 Storage: the process  of  reta ining  information  in  memory  
3.	 Retrieval: the process of accessing information stored in memory 
ENCODING INFORMATION INTO MEMORY STORES: TIME AND SPACE ARE OF THE 
ESSENCE 
Types of Memory Stores (sets of neurons that  serve to  retain information over time): 
Sensory Memory  Short  Term  Memory   Long Term Memory 
|---Rehearsal---| 
Sensory Memory (SM): memory store that holds a large amount of perceptual input for a very brief
time, typically less than 1 sec; lingering sensations 
•	 Happens automatically, w ithout effort 
•	 Arises because stimulus act ivates perceptual areas of your bra in 
Sperling Study – sensory memory in vision
Participants saw sets of letters arranged in three rows. When the  letters were flashed
very quickly (for  less than 0.25 sec), people were able to report around 4 or 5 letters, even
though they claimed to briefly remember all of them.
In another part of the study, a high, medium, or low tone was presented immediately
after the rows of letters were flashed. Participants reported the top row if the tone was high,
the medium row if it was medium, and the bottom row if it was low . They could report the
appropriate row almost perfectly, showing that they had briefly stored more than they could
report aloud.
Iconic memory stores a large amount of information but it fades very quickly. 
Short-Term Memory (STM): aka immediate memory; memory store that holds relat ively litt le
information (typically 5 or 9 items) for only a few  seconds (but can be prolonged voluntarily, perhaps 
as long as 30 seconds) 
STM differs from SM in duration and capacity 
•	
Rehearsal: repeating information over and over to  retain it  in STM 
STM can hold only about 7 ± 2 (ie: 5 –  9) items, organized into  4 chunks (unit of information… ex: 
digit , letter , word) 
•	 Amount of informat ion STM can hold depends on type of informat ion 
o  People spend more effort to menta lly hold more complex patterns or concepts 
You are conscious only of information that is present in STM, and you can typically access this
information more quickly than informat ion stored in LTM . 
1.	 SM can retain information only very briefly, and so the relatively slow process of encoding
information into STM doesn’t have a chance to finish before the contents of SM have faded 
away. 
2.	 Even if this weren’t the case, STM can ho ld re latively little information, so not all of the
information in SM can be fully transferred to STM . 
Working Memory: the memory system that includes 2 specialized STMs (auditory loop and
visuospatia l sketchpad) and a central executive  (the set of processes in WM that transforms

and interprets information into one or another of 2 specialized STMs during planning,
reasoning, and problem solving) that operates on informat ion in the STMs to plan, reason, or 
solve a problem 
Long-Term Memory (LTM): memory store that holds a huge amount  of information for a  long time 
(from hours to years) 
Stores rules that can guide WM or overt behavior;  information that specifies the meaning of
•	
pictures, words, and objects; encoded memories of everything you’ve  ever done or  learned 
Is a lmost limitless?? 
•	
•	 Plays a central role  in perception: you recognize and identify an object only after the

appropriate information is activated in LTM

Information can be transferred from STM to LTM , and vice versa 
Dist inguishing between STM and LTM 
Ebbinghaus  first solid evidence that STM and LTM are separate  and operate differently
Serial position effect: the first  and last  items studied are  more  easily remembered than those  in the 
middle… U-shaped memory curve!
Primacy effect: increased memory for the first few stimuli; occurs because we have more time
to think about the earlier ones than the later ones… stored in LTM 
Recency effect: increased memory for the last few stimuli; STM 
Making Memories 
Code : particular method for specifying informat ion (ex: words / images) 
•	 Ability to use different codes allows us to retain information more effectively than if we had
only a single code . 
o	 Concrete words are remembered better than abstract words because you can visualize
object named  by  concrete  word  and  store  that  image  along  with  the  word  itself  (2  
chances to find information in LTM later!!) 
This type of organizationa l processing occurs in the fronta l lobes. 
o	 Degree of act ivation predicts how well it will be remembered later 
Consolidation: process of converting information stored dynamically in LTM into a structura l change 
in the brain 
•	 Dynamic memory: when information first enters LTM ; if it is not activated (ie: if you’re not
doing it), it is lost 
Structural memory: no longer depends on continuing neura l act ivity; stored by connect ions 
among neurons 
Reconsolidation  recalling information can cause memories to  become vulnerable  to change , so  to be
retained, the information must be reconsolidated / restabilized as a stored structure… 
•	 Memories can be altered, disrupted, distorted during reconsolidation 
•	 Requires different proteins than consolidation 
Is necessary some times but not others 
•	
o	 Length of time information has been retained in memory, nature of task, degree to
which information was effective stored and subsequently consolidated,
correspondence between what is expected and what actually occurs help determine
whether reconso lidation is needed 
 The  more you think through the  associations and implications of information,  the  better you will 
remember its meaning.

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 5 – Memory: Living With Yesterday 
Depth of Processing : the number  and complexity of the  operations involved in processing
information, deeper processing occurs when more – or more complex – operations are used during 
encoding 
The greater the depth of processing when you first encode information, the greater the

•	
likelihood of remembering it later

The most effective processing is tailored to the reason the materia l is being learned: 
•	 Attention –  what  you initially pay attention to determines what  gets encoded 
•	 Comparability – knowing the ways in which you w ill later use stored informat ion is important
for know ing the best way to encode it 
o	 Transfer appropriate processing: processing used to retrieve material that is the same 
type as was used when it was origina lly studied, which improves memory retrieval 
Breadth of Processing: processing that organizes and integrates information into previously stored
information, often by making associat ions 
Elaborative encoding: strategies that produce grea t breadth of processing 
Ex: remembering someone’s name –  think of someone e lse  with same  first  name, 
•	
visua lize face, etc. 
It doesn’t matter how much or how hard you try to learn something; what matters is how well you
attend to, integrate , and organize the specific information you want to learn 
Intentional Learning : learning that occurs as a result of trying to learn 
Incidental Learning : learning that occurs w ithout  intention 
Emotionally Charged Memories 
Emot ion boosts memory  Why?? 
•	 Noradrenaline released during strong emotion 
•	 Hypothesis: activation of amygdala, which plays a key role in emotion and can cause more
noradrena line to be produced, which in turn enhances memory conso lidation 
Flashbulb Memories: an unusua lly vivid and detailed memory of a dramatic event 
•	 Only events that have important consequences for a person are stored as flashbulb memories 
•	 Become distorted over time… although people believe  that  they are a lways accurate 
RETAINING INFORMATION: NOT JUST ONE LTM 
Modality-Specific Memory Stores: retain input from single perceptual system, such as vision or
audition, or from a specific processing system , such as language ; multimedia bra in 
Semantic memories: memories of the  meaning of words (a  pine  is an evergreen tree w ith long 
needles), concepts (heat moves from a warmer object to a cooler one), and general facts about the
world; for the most part , you don’t remember when, where, or how you learned this kind of
information 
Episodic memories : memories of events that are  associated with a  particular context –  a time, place, 
and circumstance 
Explicit Memory: (aka declarative memory); memories that can be retrieved voluntarily and brought 
into STM 
Stored in either semantic or episodic memory 
•	
•	 Can occur in any modality 
Explicit memory is what is stored after cognitive learning occurs 
•

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 5 – Memory: Living With Yesterday 
•	 When activated, explicit memories can be operated on in WM : You can think about the
recalled information in different ways and for different purposes and build on it w ith new
ideas. 
Implicit Memory: (aka nondeclarative memory); memories that are unconscious and cannot be
retrieved voluntarily and brought into STM but ra ther predispose a person to process information or
behave in certain ways in the presence of specific stimuli 
•	 Not stored in either semantic or episodic memory 
•	 Can occur in any modality 
•	 Not stored after cognitive  learning occurs; arise  from other types of learning 
•	 Cannot be reinterpreted or otherw ise operated upon in WM 
H.M. – first  hint  that  memories can be explicit  or implicit 
Bilateral removal of hippocampus to lessen epileptic symptoms 
•	
•	 No explicit memories, but retained implicit memories 
5 Types of Implicit Memories 
•	 Classically Conditioned Responses – associative  learning; neutral stimulus is paired with a
unconditioned st imulus that produces an unconditioned response, which in turn leads the
neutra l st imulus to produce the same response as  the unconditioned 
o	 Ex: almost fa lling (unconditioned response) over balcony (neutral stimulus), falling
now associated w ith balcony, even if you don’t realize it 
•	 Nonassociative Learning –  response to  a stimulus itself changes, without  any new associations
between stimuli or between stimuli and responses being formed 
o  Ex: during habituation, a behavior changes after a stimulus is repeated over and over 
•	 Habits –  aka  procedura l  memories;  well-learned response that is carried out automatica lly
(without conscious thought) when the appropriate stimulus is present 
Skills – sets of habits that  can be  coordinated in a range of ways 
o	
2 phases: 
 Controlled processing: requires paying attention to each step of a task and using
working memory to coordinate the steps; relies on explicit memories 
 Automatic processing: allows you to carry out a sequence of steps without having
to pay attention to each one or to the relations between the steps; relies on 
implicit memories 
o	 Priming – occurs when having performed a task predisposes you to  perform the same  or an
associated task aga in in the future (ex: if you see an ant, you w ill be more prone to not icing
them in other places) 
o  Repetit ion Priming: makes the same informat ion more easily accessed in the future 
Genetic Foundations of Memory 
Evidence is emerging that different genes are used when we form different types of memories, which
demonstrates further that these  types are, in fact , distinct. 
Knockout Mice – have a particular gene purposely taken out (ie : knocked out), so that we can trace the
connection between a missing gene and an impaired type of memory 
Ex: some types of KO mice have normal episodic memory for spatial informat ion,  but  

•	
impa ired memory for conditioned fear

•	 Genes a ffect these types of memories in part by a ltering the functioning of specific parts of the
brain and in part by altering the product ion and functioning of key prote ins and
neurotransmitters that are used when new memories are stored 
 This is easier  said than done!!

= KO this can have mult iple unexpected effects…  removing a  given gene can cause the animal
to do poorly on a task for any number of reasons 
Stressed Memories 
Genes can also affect your memory by producing specific chemicals when you are stressed, which in
turn leads your brain to send signals to your body to prepare it for the fight-or-flight response, which 
helps you cope with stressful st imuli. 
Increased production of cortiso l… (long-term exposure to cort iso l kills neurons in the 
•	
hippocampus… disrupting memory)
Stress a lso disrupts other brain areas involved in storing and retrieving memories (ie: frontal lobe ,
amygda la).
When stress hormones disrupt storage processes in the hippocampus, they also disrupt  them in a 
pathway connecting the amygda la and frontal lobes. 
RETRIEVING INFORMATION FROM MEMORY: MORE THAN REACTIVATING THE PAST 
Recall: the act of intentionally brining explicit information to awareness, which requires transferring
the information from LTM to STM 
Recognition: the act of successfully matching an encoded stimulus to information about that st imulus
that was previously stored in memory 
•	 Methods of assessing memory rely on e ither recall or recognition. 
o  Questions that require recognition tend to be easier then those that demand reca ll. 
o  Recognit ion is difficult if you have to discriminate between similar cho ices. 
If the cho ices are similar, you have to access more  stored details to recognize

the correct answer. 
Cues: stimuli, thoughts, or fee lings that trigger or enhance remembering; reminders of an object or 
event 
State -Dependent Retrieval : reca ll that  is better if it occurs in the same psychologica l state that  was
present when the information was first encoded.
Ex: IF you are in a happy mood at the time you learn something, you may remember it better
when you are feeling happy than when you are feeling sad. 
Hypnosis: can sometimes improve memory of prior events; increases people’s confidence  in their
recollect ions but not the ir accuracy; can implant beliefs, leading the hypnotized person to be lieve that
suggested events happened 
WHEN MEMORY GOES WRONG –  AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT 
False Memories: memories of events or situations that did not , in fact , occur

In general, we don’t necessarily remember what actually happened but rather what we experience as

having happened.

False memories can arise from inferences we draw and also can be directly implanted by other people.

Loftus – artificially implanted memories  story to children about getting lost in mall 
Pezdek – some false memories are easier to create than others 
Strong emotions make memories more vivid, so people intuitive ly expect that if a highly emotional
event had actually happened, they would have a very vivid memory of it. (If they didn’t have a vivid 
memory, it probably didn’t happen.)

Implications in court cases  faulty w itness memories?? 
Dist inguishing Fact from Fict ion 
The hippocampus is activated when you recognize actual events as we ll as when you identify 
•	
associated / imagined events that are not rea l. 
BUT differential activation in other brain locations can help you determine whether events
actually happened. 
Actual memories can also include stored informat ion about the perceptual qualit ies of the encoded 
material. The presence of associated perceptual information is one way that actual and false memories
can be distinguished. 
Johnson et al. – people often confuse actually having seen something with having imagined seeing it. 
People with vivid mental images are more  likely to believe  they saw an event when they only
•	
read a descript ion of it. 
Reality monitoring: paying attention to characteristics that distinguish actually from  imagined stimuli 
•	 When people are asked to pay attent ion to the amount  of  perceptua l  detail  in  their  memories
(ie: texture of objects, environment , shadows), they are better able to distinguish actual
memories from false memories 
Forgetting 
Forgetting Curve : by Ebbinghaus; graphic representation of the  rate at which information is forgotten 
over t ime : Recent events are recalled better than more distant ones, but most forgetting occurs soon
after learning. 
People forget because: informat ion was not well encoded in the first place
Encoding Failure: failure to process to-be-remembered information well enough to ensure that it is 
fully entered into LTM 
Information is lost shortly after learning  sharp drop in the  forgetting curve 
•	
2 hypotheses of memories that are lost:
1.	 Memory decays and disappears 
2.	 Memory rema ins in LTM, but cannot be “found” 
Decay: loss of memories over time because the re levant  connections between neurons are  lost 
•  Some genes promotes stronger connections among neurons, while other genes prevent such
connections and block memory
Interference: occurs when information disrupts encoding or retrieval of other information 
Probably occurs because the retrieva l cues for various memories are similar, so a given cue
•	
may call up the wrong memory 
•	 Retroactive Interference: new learning impairs memory for something learned earlier 
•	 Proactive Interference: information already stored in memory makes it difficult to learn 
something new 
Intentional Forgetting: Out of Mind , Out of Sight 
•	 Relies on frontal lobes of brain  (organize informat ion during encoding and act ively  searches  
for stored memories during retrieval) 
o	
If you decide not to remember something immediately after you perce ive  it , your
frontal lobe won’t work as hard to encode the information as it does when you are
trying to store it .

Amnesia: loss of memory over an entire time span, not your usua l forgetting!! 
•	 Organic amnesia: arises after the brain has been damaged by stroke, injury, or disease 
o	 Typically impairs episodic memories, while leaving semantic memories almost entirely
intact (information that has been fully consolidated) 
o	 Depending on the locat ion of brain damage, organic amnesia could also have the
opposite effect! (ex: hippocampus) 
o	 Can somet imes result from damage to cortical brain areas that serve as LTM stores (ex:
Alzheimer’s disease) 
Functional amnesia: arises after psycho logical trauma or extreme stress, there is no obvious
problem in the brain itse lf 
o  Difficult to study because it could be ma lingering (intentional faking of amnesia) 
•	 Retrograde Amnesia: disrupts previous memories 
o	
Infantile / Childhood Amnesia: we don’t remember much about  our early childhood 
experiences 
•  Anterograde Amnesia: leaves consolidated memories intact , but prevents storing new facts 
Repressed Memories: memories of actual events that were  pushed into  the  unconscious because they 
are emotional threatening 
Improving Memory: Tricks and Tools 
Enhancing Encoding
Organize It!  chunking informat ion; hierarchical organization… for integrat ion 
Process It!  depth and breath of processing; study in short session spread out over time
