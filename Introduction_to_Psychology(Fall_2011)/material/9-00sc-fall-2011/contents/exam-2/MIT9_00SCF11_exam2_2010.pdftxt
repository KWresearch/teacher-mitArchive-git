answers then you are asked to mark), mark the best answer and include a note explaining 
why you believe the question is ambiguous - your note will be considered in the grading.

positive or negative aspects of an experience is defined as _______.

hypothalamus are activated. What additional brain area is activated when trying to 
regulate emotion? What are three of the negative consequences when trying to 
control your emotion by suppressing your behavior? 

4.  Maslow’s hierarchy of needs claims that low-level needs that are essential to life 
must be met before less basic higher level needs can be satisfied. Give four 
criticisms that argue against Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. 

5.  Fill in the blank.  
A problem can often be solved by identifying a ___________ which implies a 
solution. Difficulty in this regard, known as__________, reflects cognitive 
inflexibility. One way to overcome this difficulty is to “sleep on it”, which allows

6.  ________ consists of the processes that guide attention, thought and action in 
service of accomplishing a specific task. A popular way to study this is known as 
the ________, where participants name the color of the ink used to print words 
that name colors. Indeed, brain imaging studies suggest that the conflict 
resolution required in this task is mediated by a cortical structure in the frontal 
lobe known as the _________. In addition, such studies have also suggested that 
the updating of sub-goals (represented in the prefrontal cortex) depends heavily 
upon _________ signaling.  
  

 

 
7.  Humans are not entirely logical. One common logical mistake in which people 
incorrectly attribute a specific cause to an observed effect is known as 
__________. An example of this would be “Japanese _____ eat much fat as, and 
therefore have fewer heart attacks than, Westerners”. Another common logical 
mistake is known as confirmation bias, where people fail to consider what it would 
take to __________ a rule. For example, if you were given the rule “If a card has a 
vowel on one side, then it will have an even number on the other side”, which 
cards (below) would you have to turn over in order to confirm that this rule is true?  

 

 
  

 

 
8.  Ambiguous sentences are those that can take more than one meaning.  Give two 
examples of sentences that are ambiguous: one which is ambiguous due to only 
the semantics of a single word, and another that is ambiguous due only to its 
syntax.  For each, explain the ambiguity and identify the two (or more) possible 
interpretations.
