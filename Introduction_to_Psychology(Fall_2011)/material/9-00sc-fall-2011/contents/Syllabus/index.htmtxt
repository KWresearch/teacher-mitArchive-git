***** About this Course *****
This course is designed to introduce you to the scientific study of human
nature. You will learn how psychologists ask questions from several different
perspectives: questions about the relation of brain and behavior, about
perception, about learning and thinking, about development, about social
behavior and personality, and about psychopathology and psychotherapy. You will
also learn about the methods psychologists use to find the answers to these
questions and become acquainted with many of the important findings and
theoretical approaches in the field of psychology. By the time it's over, we
hope that you will have learned to think critically about psychological
evidence, and to evaluate its validity and its relevance to important issues in
your life.

TEXTBOOK                               DESCRIPTION
                                       This textbook is used by students
                                       enrolled in the class at MIT. It
                                       presents a large amount of material at a
                                       fairly demanding reading level.

Introducing Psychology: Brain, Person, class session:

**** Lectures ****
Videos of the twice-weekly lectures are provided.Â  For your convenience, each
lecture can be viewed in a sequence of shorter chapters, or as a single
continuous program.Â  Lecture slides and some supporting resources (e.g. video
clips and handouts used in class) are also provided.
**** Discussion Sections ****
At MIT, the twice-weekly lectures are complemented by a weekly small group
discussion section led by a teaching assistant. We present selected material
from these discussions on about half of the lecture pages, starting with
Discussion:_Brain. This content includes transcripts of short talks by TA Tyler
Perrachione, additional Check Yourself quiz content, and bigger Think About
questions to ponder and discuss with your friends.
**** Exams ****
Each exam covers about a third of the course material; the exams are not
cumulative. Each exam consists of multiple-choice questions and short-answer
questions based on the text and lectures. A solution key is provided for each
exam, so that you can check your answers. Additional exam questions from other
years are also provided as study aids.
Writing Assignments
At MIT, enrolled students are given two substantial writing assignments during
the semester, plus an optional Extra Credit assignment. Each is an original
analysis of a few scientific source readings on a controversial topic in
psychology.
Writing_Assignment_1: Are studies of cognitive and emotional developments in
adolescents useful for setting public policy guidelines, such as juvenile
access to abortion and the juvenile death penalty?
Writing_Assignment_2: Are ârecoveredâ memories real memories or false
memories?
Extra_Credit_Writing_Assignment: Is it ethical to use cognition-enhancing
drugs?
For the OCW student, we present these writing assignments as optional, in the
spirit of "further study." Due to copyright restrictions, OCW is only able to
provide links to some of the source readings.
Writing guidelines:
   1. Develop your own idea about what is the best interpretation of the
      findings you read about;
   2. Briefly summarize the main points of the controversy (about half a page
      to a page);
   3. Explain which position you find more convincing and why.
***** Grading *****
At MIT, grading was based on 60% from the exams, 30% from the two papers, and
10% on discussion section participation.

teaching assistants. Read_more_Â»
