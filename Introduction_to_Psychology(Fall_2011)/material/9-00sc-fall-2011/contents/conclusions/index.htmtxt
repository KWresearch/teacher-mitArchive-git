***** Session Overview *****
                            This final lecture considers psychological
                            perspectives on human nature (evolutionary
                            psychology) and how to live our lives (happiness).
                            For instance, to what extent do attitudes and
                            behaviors about sex and race have evolutionary
[Drawing of a smiley face.] roots? Does more money, more vacation time, or more
                            choice actually make us happier? Can we predict
                            what things will make us happy, and act upon those
                            predictions?
                            Keywords: racism, sexuality, happiness, affective
                            forecasting, paradox of choice, positive psychology
