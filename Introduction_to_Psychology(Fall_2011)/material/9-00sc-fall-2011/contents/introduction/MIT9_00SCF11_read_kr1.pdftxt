Methods 

Psychologists use  science to try to  understand not only why people  behave  in abnormal or se lf-
destruct ive ways but  also why and how people think, fee l, and behave  in “norma l ways. 

THE SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY: GETTING TO KNOW YOU 

What is Psychology? 
Psychology –  the  science of the mind and behavior 
•	
Science –  uses objective evidence  to reason about  possible  causes of a  phenomenon; tests the  
result ing ideas by collecting additional facts that will either support  the  ideas or refute  them 
•	 Mind – what the brain does when you are thinking or  feeling 
o	 To collect objective facts about  the mind, we  often work backward 
� Ex: observe  what people do on the outside, and infer what could be  going on 
inside 
o	 Another method: brain-scanning � show physical changes of brain at work and relate 
those to  the mental events they produce 
� Ex: amygdala activation suggests strong emotiona l reactions 
•	 Behavior –  the  outwardly observable  acts of a  person, alone or  in a group 
o	 Physical movements 
“Layers upon layers” � an individual’s mental state depends on brain functioning, and mental 
events affect his or her behavior , and –  at the same  time  – these events are affected by the 
surrounding group (the members of which, in turn, have their  own individua l minds and 
behaviors). 

Research in psycho logy: describe  / explain AND predict  / control mental events and behavior!! 

Levels of Analysis: The  Complete Psychology 
1.	 Level of the brain –  events that  involve the activity, structure, properties of the  organ itself – 
brain cells and the ir connections, the chemical solutions in which they exist, and the genes 
2.	 Level of the person – events that involve  the  funct ion  (mental  processes) and  content  (mental  
content) of the mind 
a.	 Mental contents – knowledge, beliefs (including ideas, explanations, and expectations), 
desires (such as hopes, goals, and needs), and fee lings (such as fears, guilts, and 
attractions) 
� Ex: visualiz ing the  letter “n” in your head 
b.	 Mental processes –  sets of operations that work together  to carry out a  function, such 
as attent ion, perception, or memory 
� Ex: rotating the letter “n” in your head 
Note: the bra in and the  mind are not the same thing! 
3.	 Level of the group – events that involve  relationships between people (such as love,

compet ition, and cooperat ion), relationships among groups, and culture

a.	 How  other people  affect  an individual’s mind and behavior 
b.	 Dist inct identities of groups (ex: culture  –  language, be liefs, va lues, norms, behaviors, 
and even material objects that are  passed from  one generation to the next) 
It is important to  relate each level of analysis to  the physical world that surrounds a ll of us!! 

Events at  the different  levels are a lso  constant ly interacting: 
•	 Events at  each level modify and trigger  events at the other leve ls. 

This “levels” view of psycho logy lets you see how  different types of theories and discoveries 
illuminate the same  phenomenon but also lets you see how  these theories and discoveries are 
interconnected –  and thus how the field of psycho logy as a whole  emerges from  them.

PSYCHOLOGY THEN AND NOW 

The Evolution of Science 
The roots of psycho logy lie in: 
•	 Philosophy (the field that re lies on logic and speculation to  understand the  nature of reality, 
experience , and va lues) 
o	 Psychology borrowed theories of the nature  of the  mind / behavior 
o	 Descartes – distinct ion between mind and body / relation between the two 
o	 Locke –  all human knowledge arises from  experience of the world / reflect ion about it; 
what we  know  about the world is based on how it  is represented in the mind 
•  Physiology (the  fie ld that studies the biologica l workings of the  body, including the  brain) 
o	 Psychologists learned to  recognize the ro le of the mind in giving rise to  mental events 
and behavior ; acquired scient ific approach to  studying brain function / how  it 
produces  mental events and  behavior  

Early Days: Beginning to Map the Mind and Behavior 
Early psychologists were  interested in understanding the operation of perception (the  ways in which 
we interpret  informat ion from out eyes, ears, and other sensory organs), memory, and problem 
solving 

Structuralism – the school of psychology that sought to ident ify the basic elements of consciousness 
(the state of being aware) and to describe the rules and circumstances under  which these  elements 
combine  to form menta l structures 
•	 Began with the work of Wilhe lm Wundt 
•	
First  organized “school of thought” in psycho logy 
•	 Consciousness itself occurs at  the  level of the person, but this process relies on brain function 
o  Wundt’s research led him to  characterize  2 types of elements of consciousness: 
1.	 Sensations 
2.	 Feelings 
•	 Edward Titchener (student of Wundt) – broadened structuralist approach to  apply it to the 
nature  of concepts and thinking in general 
•	 Primary research tool: introspection – the technique of observing your mental events as, or 
immediate ly after, they occur 
o	 Ex: What is the  nature of mental images? What factors are emphasized when making 
decisions? 
o	 Problems with introspection: 
1. 	 How  do  you prove  that  mental  images actua lly exist and that objects  can  
indeed be visua lized? 
•	 Mental images are not “universal.” 
2.	 A considerable amount of mental contents / mental processing cannot be 
accessed via introspection. 

Functionalism – the school of psychology that  sought  to understand how the mind helps individuals 
to adapt to  the  world around them, to  function effective ly in it 
•	 Why humans think, feel, and behave as we do? 
•	 Addressed events at  the  level of the  person and at  the level of the  group  
•	 Wanted to gather  knowledge that could be  put to  immediate  use 
•	
Studied the methods by which people learn; how goals and beliefs are shaped by

environments

Strongly influenced by Charles Darw in; applied his theories to mental characterist ics 
o	 Ex: William  James – studied the ways in which being able  to pay attention can he lp an 
individual survive  and adapt to  an environment

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 1 – Introduction to the Science of Psychology: History and Research 
Methods 

•  Theorized that human psychology (at least some of it) is related to the psychology of anima ls 
o	 Led to  the  study of animal behavior that can provide clues about  characteristics of 
human mind and behavior 
Focus on social issues – ex: improving methods of education 

•	

Gesta lt Psychology –  an approach to  understanding mental events that focuses on the  idea that the 
whole  is more  than the  sum of  its  parts  
•	
Interested in consciousness, part icularly as it  arises during perception (the  organizing and 
interpreting of sensory information) 
•	
Focus on the  levels of the  brain and the  person  
•	 Led by Max Wertheimer  – noted that much of the content of our  thoughts comes from what 
we perceive, and further , from inborn tendencies to structure what we  sense  in certain ways 
•	 Deve loped >100  perceptual laws (principles) that describe how our minds organize  the  world 
o	 Perceptual unit – a  who le formed from  individual parts 
•	 Ex: flock of birds 
•	 Why Gestalt Psychology is important –  perception is the  gateway to the  world 
o	
If our  perceptions are  not accurate , our  corresponding thoughts and fee lings w ill be  
based on distorted views of reality. 
•	 The research of the Gestalt ists addressed how mental processes work, and this work in turn 
led to detailed studies of how the brain gives rise to such mental processes and how  mental 
processes influence mental contents. 

Psychodynamic Theory: More Than Meets the Eye 
Sigmund Freud 
•	 The mind is not a  single thing, but  has separate components 
•	
Some of these components are  unconscious  – outside conscious awareness and not able to  be 
brought  into consciousness at  will 
o	
Sexua l (aggressive) urges arise from unconscious mental contents / menta l processes 
•	 A child absorbs their  parents’ and culture’s moral standards, which then shape  the  child’s 
(and later, the adult’s) goals and mot ivat ions. 
•	 We often find our urges unacceptable  and so  keep them  in check, hidden in the  unconscious. 
o	 These  unconscious  urges build up  until, eventually and inevitably, they  demand  
release as thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. 
•	
Focus on the  level of the  person, also relies on the  level of the  group  
•	 AKA psychodynamic theory – a  theory of mental events that specifies the cont inual push-and­
pull interaction among conscious and unconscious thoughts and fee lings and specifies how 
such interactions affect  behavior 
•	 Problems: 
o	 The guiding principles of psychodynamic theory do NOT re ly on results from objective 
scientific studies, but instead rest primarily on sub jective  interpretations of what 
people  say and do . 
o	 Very intricate, complicated � can easily expla in opposite observations as well 
o	 Difficult to  test 
Legacy : o	 Complex behavior  is driven by mental processes operating on mental contents 
o	
Some mental contents and processes are hidden from awareness 
o	 Attention to previously ignored types of behavior (ex: dreams, slips of tongue) 
o	 New  approaches to treating psycho logical problems (ex: identifying underlying causes, 
not just treating symptoms) 

•	

Behaviorism: The Power of the Environment 
Behaviorists believed that  psychologists should study the  mind, not unseen phenomena.

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 1 – Introduction to the Science of Psychology: History and Research 
Methods 

Edward Lee Thorndike , John B. Watson, Clark L. Hull, B.F. Skinner – psychology should concentrate 
on understanding directly  observable  behavior  

Behaviorism – the schoo l of psycho logy that focuses on how a  specific stimulus (object, person, or 
event) evokes a  specific response (behavior in reaction to  the  st imulus) 
•	
Stimulus-response associations 
•	
Focus on events at the leve l of the  person 
•	 Key idea : reinforcement –  a desirable  consequence  that occurs after  an individual responds to  a 
stimulus in a particular way 
o	 Ex: rewards, payment  for a  job 
o	
If the consequence of a response  is reinforcing, we  are likely to  repeat  the  response 
when we  encounter the stimulus. If a response produces an undesirable consequence 
(“punishment”), we are  less like ly to do it again. 
•	 Deve loped important principles that describe  the  condit ions (i.e .: history of reinforcement) in 
which part icular responses are  likely to  occur or not occur 
•	 Emphasis on contro lled, object ive observation 
•	 Unfortunately, many of the behaviorists’ objections to the study of mental contents and 
processes have  not  stood the test of time. 
o	 We can study mental contents and menta l processes! 
o	 Consequences alone cannot account for behavior . 

Humanistic Psycho logy – the school of psychology that assumes people have positive values, free 
will, and deep inner creativity, the combination of which allow them  to choose life-fulfilling paths 
to personal growth 
•	 Emerged as a  reaction to  Freud and behaviorism 
•	 Abraham Maslow 
•	
Focus on the  level of the  person  
•	 All individuals and their  unique experiences  should be  respected  
•	 Carl Rogers – developed a  therapy based on the humanistic approach � client-centered therapy 
o	 Human nature leads each of us to want to deve lop to our fullest potential, and the 
therapist’s job is to  he lp us to do so . 
o	 Therapists should be unconditionally supportive and provide a positive environment 
to help the client overcome  obstacles and develop  to their  full potentia l. 
•	 Emphasis on humans as active agents who can formulate  plans and make decisions. 
•	 Led to  the  emergence of positive psychology – area of psycho logy that focuses on “the  strengths 
and virtues that  enable individuals and communit ies to  thrive.” 

The Cognitive Revolution 
•	 Late 1950s, early 1960s – use  of computer as a model for  the  way the  human mind works 
•	 mid 1970s – led by Herbert A. Simon, Alan Newe ll, Noam Chomsky 

Cognitive  Psycho logy – the approach in psychology that attempts to characterize the menta l events 
that allow information to  be  stored and operated on internally 
•	 The mind is like  the  software (with stored data) on a computer , and the brain is like the 
hardware (the machine itself) 
Computers showed why it is important  that there be a science  of the unobservable events that  take 
place  in the head. 
•	
If someone is acting oddly, we  must  go  beyond the essential step of noticing unusual 
behavior ; we  also need to think about what is happening inside and consider  what is causing 
the problem 

The cognitive  revolution led to new ways of conceptualizing and treating menta l disorders.

Methods 

Cognitive  Neuroscience  – the approach in psychology that blends cognit ive psycho logy and 
neuroscience  (the study of the  bra in) when attempting to specify how the  brain gives rise to 
mental processes that store and process information 
•	 Discover the nature , organization, and operation of mental events by studying the brain 
•	 Goal: distinguish among different  sorts of mental processes by show ing that different brain 
areas give  rise to  those processes 
•	 Considers events at 3  levels of ana lysis, primary focus on the bra in 

Evolutionary Psycho logy –  the  approach in psychology that  assumes that certain cognitive strategies 
and goals are so important that natural select ion has built  them into  our  bra ins 
•	 Addresses events at all 3  levels of analysis, but primary focus on the  levels of the  person and 
group 
•	 Lida  Cosmides, John Tooby, David  Buss, Steven  Pinker  
•	 Ex: lying 
o	 More devious ancestors had more  children who survived than did the ir nonlying 
contemporaries and their  lying children, who inherited this ability in turn had more 
children, etc,, unt il the ability to  lie was inborn in all members of our species 
•	 Compare human abilities w ith those of other animals, especially non-human primates 
•	 Evolutionary theories are difficult to test because we don’t’ know what our ancestors were like 
/ how  they evolved

THE RESEARCH PROCESS: HOW WE FIND THINGS OUT 

The Scientific Method – a  way to gather  facts that w ill lead to  the  formulat ion and validation (or 
refutation) of a  theory 
1.	 Systematically Observing Events 
a.	 All science ultimately begins with observations. Scientists want  to know the facts. 
b.	 Facts are established by co llect ing data –  careful descriptions or numerical 
measurements of a  phenomenon.  
2.	 Formulating a Quest ion 
3.	 Forming a Hypothesis 
a.	 Hypothesis –  tentative  idea that might  explain a set of observations; specifies a 
relationship between two  or more variables (often proposing that one variable causes 
another) 
i.	 Variable –  an aspect of a  situation that can vary, or  change; specifically, a 
characteristics of a  substance , quantity, or entity that is measurable 
4.	 Testing the Hypothesis 
a.	 The key concepts of a hypothesis must be specific enough to test. 
b.	 Operational definition –  a definit ion of a concept that specifies how  it is measured or 
manipulated 
c. 	 Need 2  types of observations:  
i.	 Those  that direct ly address the  object  of study 
ii.	 Those  that  indirect ly address the  object  of study 
5.	 Formulating a Theory 
a.	 Theory – concepts or principles that explain a  set of research findings; focuses on the 
underlying reasons why certa in relationships may exist in data 
6.	 Testing the Theory 
a.	 Theories must  be  able  to explain previous observa tions after the  fact and a lso  predict 
new ones.

9.00 EXAM 1 NOTES 
KOSSLYN CHAPTER 1 – Introduction to the Science of Psychology: History and Research 
Methods 

Naturalistic Observation – collected from real-world settings, observing events as they natura lly occur 
•	 Often the first  step of the scientific method because it is difficult to  use to  test specific

hypotheses for a  finding


Case Studies – scientific studies that focus on a  single participant, examining his or her psychologica l 
characteristics (at any or all of the levels of analysis) in detail 
•	 Goal: discover underlying principles that can be applied to  all similar people 
•	
Limitations: must  be caut ious genera lizing from a single case 

Surveys – set of questions that people are  asked about their  be liefs, att itudes, preferences, or act ivities 
•	
Inexpensive way to collect a  lot of data quickly 
•	 Popular  among psychologists who  study personality, social interactions 
•	
Limitations: some require respondents to  introspect about  the ir fee lings (people may not  be 
capable  of report ing accurate ly all such information); people  may not always respond 
honestly; some  people who  are asked may not  respond to the survey � it is difficult to  know 
whether the responses obta ined are actually representative of the whole  group that the survey 
was designed to  assess 
•	 Design considerations: survey questions must be carefully worded so that they don’t lead the 
respondents to  answer in a certain way 

Correlational Research: Do Birds of a Feather Flock Together? 
Researchers can use  methods that  rely on correlation to  study the  relationships among variables. 
Correlation –  relationship in which 2 variables are  measured for each person, group, or entity, and the 
variations in measurements of one  variable  are compared to  the variations in measurements of the 
other variable. 
Correlation coefficient  –  a number  that ranges from -1 .0 to 1 .0 that indicates how  closely interrelated 2 
sets of measured variables are ; the higher the coefficient (in either the positive or  negative 
direction), the  better  the  value  of one  measurement can predict the  va lue  of the other .  Also  simply  
called a  corre lation. 
•	 Posit ive correlation: corre lation value fa lls between 0 and 1.0 
•	 Negative correlation: corre lation value fa lls between -1 .0 and 0 
•  No  correlat ion: no re lationship between the  2 variables 
Correlational research has 2 steps: 
1.	 Obta ining measurements of 2 variables 
2.	 Examining the way that 1 set of measurements goes up or down in tandem w ith another  set of 
measurements 
Advantages: allows researchers to compare variables that  cannot  be  manipulated direct ly 
Disadvantages: correlations indicate only that values of 2 variables tend to vary together, not that 
values of one cause the values of the other 
� Correlation does not imply causation! 

Experimental Research: Manipulating and Measuring 

Independent Variable – the aspect  of the situation that is deliberately and independently varied while 
another  aspect is measured 
Dependent  Variable – the aspect of the  situation that is  measured as the  values of an  independent  
variable are  changed; in an exper iment, the  va lue  of the  dependent  variable is expected to  depend  
on the value of the independent variable 
By examining the  link between independent  and dependent variables, a  researcher  hopes to discover 
exactly which factor  is causing an effect: the difference in the  value of the  dependent variable that 
arises from  change sin the independent variable

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 1 – Introduction to the Science of Psychology: History and Research 
Methods 

Demonstrating that  changes in an independent variable are  accompanied by changes in the 
dependent variable is usua lly not enough to confirm a hypothesis. In most cases, it’s re latively 
easy to  offer  more  than one interpretation of a rela tion between an independent and a dependent 
variable, and hence  additional research is necessary to understand what this re lation means. 
Researchers can narrow down the explanations by testing additional groups or  conducting separate 
experiments. Only by eliminating other possibilit ies can researchers come  to know why varying 
the independent variable produces an effect on the dependent  variable 

Confounding variable – any aspect of the situation that varies a long with the independent variable (or 
variables) of interest and could be the actual basis for what is measured 
•  Confounds lead to  results that are ambiguous, tha t do not have  a clear-cut interpretation. 

Experimental and Control Groups and Conditions e liminate  the  possible  influences of  confounds  
Experimental Group – a  group that rece ives the complete  procedures that defines the experiment 
Contro l Group – a  group that  is treated exactly the  same  way as the  experimental group, except that 
the independent variable that is the  focus o the study is not manipulated. The control group holds 
constant –  “controls” – a ll of the variables in the experimental group 
Random assignment – the technique  of assigning participants randomly, that is, by chance , to the 
experimental and the contro l groups, so that the members of the  two  groups are  comparable in a ll 
relevant ways 

Rather  than using 2 different  groups to disentangle confounds, researchers might have a single group 
that has 2  different conditions: 
Experimental condition – a  part  of the  study in which part icipants receive the complete procedure 
that defines the experiment 
Contro l condit ion – a  part  of the study in which participants rece ive the same procedures as in the 
experiment condit ion, except that the independent variable  of interest is not manipulated 
In other  words, the same  people are  tested twice , once in each condition. 

Quasi-Experimental Design – includes independent and dependent variables and assesses the effects 
of different values of the independent variable on the values of the dependent  variable , but 
participants are not randomly assigned to conditions and the  conditions typica lly are selected 
from naturally occurring situations 
•	 Used because it is not always possible or  desirable to assign people to  different groups 

randomly

•	 Advantage : allows the  study of real-world phenomena that cannot be  studied in experiments 
•	 Disadvantage: cannot control re levant  aspects of the independent  variables 

�� See p. 29, Table 3 for Summary of Research Methods in Psychology 

Meta-Analysis – statist ical technique that a llows researchers to  combine results form different  studies 
on the same topic in order to discover whether there is a relat ionship among variables 
•	 Useful when the  results from many studies are  not entire ly consistent , with some showing an 
effect and some not 
•	 Not  a way to collect new data � it  is a way of analyzing data  that  have a lready been co llected 
•	 By combining the samples form  many studies, meta-analysis allows you to detect even subtle 
differences or re lations among variables

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 1 – Introduction to the Science of Psychology: History and Research 
Methods 

•	

Reliability –  consistency;  data  are reliable  if the  same  values are  obtained when the  measurements are  
repeated 
Validity – a  research method is valid if it does in fact measure  what  it is supposed to measure 
Bias – when conscious or  unconscious beliefs, expectations, or habits alter how participants in a  study 
respond or  affect how a  researcher  sets up or conducts a study, thereby influencing its outcome 
•	 Response bias – a tendency to respond in a particular way regardless of respondents’  actua l 
know ledge  or be liefs 
Sampling bias – a bias that occurs when the participants are not chosen at random  but instead 
are chosen so  that  one  attribute is over- or underrepresented 
Experimenter Expectancy Effects – effects that occur when an invest igator’s expectations lead him  or 
her (consciously or unconsciously) to treat participants in a  way that  encourages them to  produce 
the expected results  
Double-design Design – the  participant  is “blind” to (unaware  to) the predictions of the study ( and so 
cannot consciously  or  unconsciously produce  the  predicted results) and the exper imenter  is  
“blind” to the group to which the  part icipant has been assigned or  to the condit ion that  the 
participant is receiving ( and so experimenter expectancy effects cannot  produce  the  predicted  
results) 

Psychology and Pseudopsychology : What’s Flaky and What Isn’t? 
Pseudopsycho logy – theories or  statements that  at  first glance look like psycho logy but  are in fact 
superstit ion or unsupported opionin, not  based in science 
•  Ex: tea-leaf reading, daily horoscopes, pa lm  reading, etc. 
One key to distinguishing psychology and pseudopsycho logy is the  method, but  just fo llow ing the 
scientific method is not enough to ensure  that  a set of claims is not  pseudopsychology! 

Ethics: Doing It Right 

Research with  People: Human Guinea Pigs? 
Informed consent – the requirement that a  potential part icipant  in a  study be to ld what he or  she will 
be asked to do  and be  advised of possible risks and benefits of the  study before  forma lly agree ing 
to take part 
A study that uses funds from  the  U.S. government  or from most  private  funding sources must be 
approved by  an  institutional review board  at the university, hospital, or  other  inst itution that  sponsors 
or hosts the  study. 
Concerns about ethical treatment  of human participants lead most  IRBs to insist  that  part icipants be 
debriefed –  interviewed after the study to  ask about their  experience and explain why it  was conducts 
(ensures that  the  part icipant has no negative react ions from  part icipating and that  they have 
understood the  purposes of the  study)  

Research with  Animals 
Animals can’t give informed consent, vo lunteer , decide to withdraw from  the  study if they experience 
pain or are uncomfortable. Neverthe less, the IRB still makes sure  that  animals are protected. 
•	
Is it ethica l to test anima ls at all???? 

Ethics in Clinical Practice 
1.	 Beneficence , Nonmaleficence 
2.	 Fidelity and Responsibility 
3.	 Integrity 
4.	 Just ice 
5.	 Respect for People’s Rights and Dignity 

New Frontiers: Neuroethics � focus on the possible dangers and benefits of research on the brain
