dwell on the picture.  Look at it only long enough to 
“take it all in” once.  After that, you will answer yes or 
no to a series of questions.

McGurk Effect Demo

• Most adults (98%) think they hear "DA”

• In reality, you 
- hear the sound "BA”
- see the lip movements "GA"

COGNITIVE & AFFECTIVE 
FORECASTING

• think about your future

AFFECTIVE FORECASTING

• think about your future

most people think about 
achieving & succeeding rather 
than fumbling or failing

AFFECTIVE FORECASTING

• if I don’t get tenure, I will be sad… if I 
do get tenure I will be happy
two years later - no difference
• if I win the lottery, I will be happy!
a year or two later, no difference

AFFECTIVE FORECASTING

• if I don’t get tenure, I will be sad… if I 
do get tenure I will be happy
two years later - no difference
• if I win the lottery, I will be happy!
a year or two later, no difference
• accident leading to quadriplegia or 
paraplegia - return to typical 
ratings in 3 months 

Mispredicting Affective and 
Behavioral Response to Racism -
Kawakami et al., Science, 2009

• Racism is condemned
• Blatant racism still occurs
33% of whites report hearing anti-
black slurs in workplace

Mispredicting Affective and 
Behavioral Response to Racism
• two groups - “forecaster” or 
“experiencer”
• you enter room - see a black male & a 
white male - black male leaves room to 
get cell phone, gently bumps white male 
knee
•• control - nothing else
•• moderate slur “Typical, I hate it 
when black people do that”
•• extreme slur …. “clumsy N word”

Mispredicting Affective and 
Behavioral Response to Racism 
• two groups - “forecaster” or 
“experiencer”
•• control - nothing else
•• moderate slur “Typical, I hate it 
when black people do that”
•• extreme slur …. “clumsy N word”
• black male returns, experimenter gives 
survey on current feelings, asks you to 
pick a partner for anagram task
