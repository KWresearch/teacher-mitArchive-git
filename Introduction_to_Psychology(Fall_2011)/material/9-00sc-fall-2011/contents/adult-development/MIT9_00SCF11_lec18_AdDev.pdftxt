ADULT DEVELOPMENT 

• brain development from infancy to 
young adulthood 
• cognitive stability & decline in 
adulthood 
• alteration in hemispheric asymmetry 
with age 
• exercise, aging, & the brain 
• socioemotional selectivity & amygdala

• reward system of the brain 
• gist vs. specificity in decision making  13

Summary of Neurogenesis 
• Cells divide along the ventricular zone 

• Earliest neurons during the 2rd embryonic week (EW) 

• Peak production during the 7th EW - 500,000 
neurons/minute 

• Mostly completed by 18th EW, but continues in adults(??)


• Excess production followed by programmed cell death 

e.g., Frontal lobe neuron density is: 
55% above adults at age 2 
20% above adults at age 5 
10% above adults at age 7 

16 

Neurogenesis in Adult Brain? 


• for many years, answer was no in  

mammalian brains

• neurogenesis in granule cells in  

olfactory bulb & dentate gyrus of 

hippocampus

• Gould thought she observed new 

neurons in adult primates

• Rakic argues these were really glia 

17


Neurogenesis in Adult Brain? 

• Bhardwaj, 2006 
• nuclear bomb tests during Cold War sent 
14C into atmosphere, 1955-1963, Test Ban 
Treaty, decreased 
• integrated with DNA, date mark for cell birth

• non-neuronal cells are generated, but 
neurons are not generated in adult neocortex 
• Bromodeoxyuridine (5-bromo-2 ­
deoxyuridine, BrdU) incorporates into newly 
synthesized DNA

Neocortical neurons are as old as the individual. (A) The cerebral lobes are outlined (the large colored fields), and the cortical area 
analyzed within each lobe is color-coded. Both prefrontal (blue) and premotor (light blue) areas were analyzed in the frontal lobe. 
The analysis of occipital cortex was reported in ref. 23. (B) A representative example of values obtained from one individual born 
after the nuclear weapons tests plotted on to the curve of atmospheric 14C levels indicates that nonneuronal cells turn over, whereas 
the cortical neurons were generated close to the time of birth. (C) A representative example of the analysis of an individual born 
before the nuclear tests, indicating no measurable cortical neurogenesis. The 14C level in the nonneuronal cells demonstrates there is 
turnover within this population, but there are several possible interpretations of these data, and the age of this population cannot be 
concluded from this material alone. The coloring of symbols in B and C corresponds to the regions in A. Vertical bars in B and C 
indicate the birth date of the individual.

Exercise-Induced Neurogenesis

• measure cerebral blood volume (CBV) in 
hippocampus, including dentate 
• exercise in mice selectively increases 
CBV in dentate 
• exercise-induced increases in dentate 
CBV correlated with post-mortem 
measures of neurogenesis 
• in humans (12 weeks, 4/wk, 1hr) 
selective effect on dentate CBV, CBV 
changes correlate with cognitive 
functions 

21

Exercise selectively increases dentate gyrus CBV in mice. (a) Exercise had a selective effect on dentate gyrus CBV. Bar graphs show the mean 
relative CBV (rCBV) values for each hippocampal subregion in the exercise group (filled bars) and the nonexercise group (open bars) over the 
6-week study. The dentate gyrus was the only hippocampal subregion that showed a significant exercise effect, with CBV peaking at week 4, 
whereas the entorhinal cortex showed a nonsignificant increase in CBV. (b) An individual example. (Left) High-resolution MRI slice that 
visualizes the external morphology and internal architecture of the hippocampal formation. (Center) Parcellation of the hippocampal 
subregions (green, entorhinal cortex; red, dentate gyrus; dark blue, CA3 subfield; light blue, CA1 subfield). (Right) Hippocampal CBV map 
(warmer colors reflect higher CBV).

Exercise-induced increases in dentate gyrus CBV correlate with neurogenesis. (a) (Left) Exercising mice were found to have more 
BrdU labeling compared with the no-exercise group. (Right) As shown by confocal microscopy, the majority of the new cells were 
colabeled with NeuN (red, BrdU labeling; green, NeuN; yellow, BrdU/NeuN double labeling). (b) (Left) A significant linear 
relationship was found between changes in dentate gyrus CBV and BrdU labeling. (Right) A quadratic relationship better fits the data. 
The vertical stippled line in each plot splits the x axis into CBV changes that decreased (left of line) versus those that increased (right of 
line) with exercise.

Exercise-induced increases in dentate gyrus 
CBV correlate with aerobic fitness and 
cognition. (a) (Left) VO2max, the gold-standard 
measure of exercise-induced aerobic fitness, 
increased after exercise. (Right) Cognitively, 
exercise has its most reliable effect on first-trial 
learning of new declarative memories. (b) (Left) 
Exercise-induced changes in VO2max correlated 
with changes in dentate gyrus (DG) CBV but not 
with other hippocampal subregions, including 
the entorhinal cortex (EC), confirming the 
selectivity of the exercise-induced effect. 
(Center) Exercise-induced changes in VO2max 
correlated with postexercise trial 1 learning but 
not with other cognitive tasks, including delayed 
recognition. (Right) Post-exercise trial 1 learning 
correlated with exercise-induced changes in 
dentate gyrus CBV but not with changes in other 
hippocampal subregions, including the 
entorhinal cortex.

Cell Migration

• neurons must travel to 
intended locations 
• migration occurs over 
months and perhaps 8 
months postnatally 
• across radial glial 
tracks - following 
molecular cues 
• cell’s initial destination 
and function 
predetermined as it 
starts migration

Synaptic Formation 
• occurs concurrently in all areas, but at different rates in 
different areas 
• prenatal (from 5 weeks in spinal cord) and postnatal (2 years 
in cortex) 
• peak growth - maybe 1.8 million synapses/second 
• increase in density until 2 years 
50% lost by age 16 (shedding) 
• pruning & selection - activity dependent - use it or lose it 
neural Darwinism - lose 20 billion synapses per day 
into adolescence

Myelination

Speeds Signaling along the Axon

• Myelin: fatty sheath, multiple layers of compacted 
oligodendroglia membranes 

• Insulates segments of the axon bioelectrically 

• Accelerates signal (action potential) conduction velocity

• fear important for survival 
• amygdala essential for learned fear 
• fear conditioning - neutral stimulus (odor)

• attachment in rats learned postnatally and 
through olfaction 
• young pups (up to postnatal day 9)

• amygdala metabolic activity (measured by 2 do-oxyglucose uptake) higher 
in young pups but did not vary in response to paired presentations of odor-

A Long Future


• for most of human history, life expectancy about 20 years

• 1800s – mid 30s 
• 2000 – 77; 2010 – 78 
• 50,000 centenarians in US (3x 10 years ago) and expected 
to be 1 million by 2050; maybe 50% of girls born in 2000 
will live for a century 
• families may have 4/5 generations alive at once 
• giant effects on education, pension, work, financial 
markets 
• old model – manage child, go to college, career, mate, 
family, retire at 65 
• 1/10 over 65 now, in 20 years ¼ over 65 

33

• little studied in middle ages

• are we done developing at 20?

Aging: Loss of Speed vs. Gain 

in Knowledge/Expertise


• air traffic controllers in Canada – US 
retirement is 55 – Canada is 65 – age 
influenced simple processing speed, 
but not task performance 
• 118 pilots – 40-69 years of age – flight 
simulators – tested 3 times across 3 
years – older pilots worse in Year 1 – 
then were better in Years 2/3 

39 

DOES MEMORY DECLINE WITH 
AGE? 

• yes for declarative memory 
mildly, steadily in healthy aging 
severely in Alzheimer’s disease 

• implicit memory (repetition priming) 
can be minimally influenced by age 
and even by Alzheimer’s disease

Framing Heuristic –

Risk Averse for Gains, Risk Taking for Losses


If Program A is adopted, 200 people will be saved. 
(72%) - Lives saved 
If Program B is adopted, there is a one-third probability
that 600 people will be saved, and a two-thirds
probability that no people will be saved. 
Which Program do you favor? 

If Program A is adopted, 400 people will die. 
(22%) - Lives lost 
If Program B is adopted, there is a one-third probability
that nobody will die, and a two-thirds probability that
600 people will die. 
Which Program do you favor?

Adolescence

Do adolescents have the same cognitive abilities as 

adults? 

Death penalty for teenage criminals?


Choices 
Swim with Sharks? 
adult – gist – bad idea, you could die 
adolescent – weigh the factors of gain and 
loss 
Have Unprotected Sex? 
adult – gist – bad idea, STD, HIV, you could 

die 
adolescent – weigh the factors of gain (sex is 
fun, a sure thing) and loss (what are the odds 
I will get infected or die from a single sex 
act?)
