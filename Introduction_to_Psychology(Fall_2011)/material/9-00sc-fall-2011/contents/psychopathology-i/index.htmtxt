***** Session Overview *****
                                       What is psychopathology? Why is
                                       psychopathology important? During this
                                       lesson, we will examine the history of
                                       psychopathology and various experiments
                                       that demonstrate the importance of
                                       accurate diagnoses of mental disorders.
                                       We will also look in detail at the
                                       symptoms, causes, and treatment of
