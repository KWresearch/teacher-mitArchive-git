What is a mental disorder?
What is a mental disorder?
A clinically significant behavioral or 
psychological syndrome or pattern that 
occurs in a person and that is associated with 
present distress (a painful symptom) or 
disability (impairment in one or more 
important areas of functioning) or with a 
significantly increased risk of suffering death, 
pain, disability, or an important loss of 
freedom. (DSM-IV)

1840 
rate of death from "childbed fever“ in a ward served by 
physicians was 4x as high as mothers in a ward in the same 
hospital served by midwives

•

• deaths tended to occur in women in the same rows of beds
• psychological? (priest/last rites/death bell) - no
• same doctor?
• didn't wash hands (unmanly)

• wash hands in a solution of chlorine and lime -
• deaths fell from 12% to 1.2% in 15 months

• 1848 revolution - fired - stopped - back to 15% death rate
• Joseph Lister 1880
lost sanity, told people in streets to wash hands and avoid 
•

David Rosenhan
Professor of Law and Psychology, Emeritus
Stanford University

Rosenhan study - pseudopatients who heard voices -
admitted - then ok - 7/8 diagnosed as schizophrenics - 19-72 
days to get out - taking notes = "writing behavior" -
"Schizophrenia, now in remission"

18

Rosenhan (1973):
Rosenhan (1973):
On Being Sane in Insane Places
On Being Sane in Insane Places
One pseudopatient described that he had 
had a close relationship with his mother 
but was rather remote from his father 
during his early childhood. During 
adolescence and beyond, however, his 
father became a close friend, while his 
relationship with his mother cooled. 

His present relationship with his wife was 
characteristically close and warm. Apart 
from occasional angry exchanges, friction 
was minimal. The children had rarely been 
spanked.
19

Rosenhan (1973):
Rosenhan (1973):
On Being Sane in Insane Places
On Being Sane in Insane Places
“This white 39-year-old male . . . manifests a long 
history of considerable ambivalence in close 
relationships, which began in early childhood. 

A warm relationship with his mother cools during 
his adolescence. A distant relationship to his 
father is described as becoming very intense. 
Affective stability is absent. His attempts to 
control emotionality with his wife and children are 
punctuated by angry outbursts and, in the case of 
the children, spankings. 

And while he says that he has several good 
friends, one senses considerable ambivalence 
embedded in those relationships also.”

• After 7 to 52 days, released with 
Schizophrenia “in remission”
• “Patient resumes writing behavior”
• “Oral fixation” of mental patients
• Other patients were skeptical: "You're not 
crazy. You're a journalist, or a professor 
[referring to the continual note-taking]. 
You're checking up on the hospital."

DIAGNOSIS
DIAGNOSIS
Criteria for diagnostic category

• signs (what examiner sees) and symptoms (what 
patient says)
• syndrome = cluster of signs & symptoms

• can be reliably assessed
• validated by independent measures
– natural history = clinical course & outcome
– response to specific treatment
– causality - etiology & pathogenesis

• Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American 
Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV) - descriptions of 
signs & symptoms of psychiatric disease

Bleuler 1911 - splitting of mental functions - disintegration of emotions, thought, and 
actions

Prevalence
1% of worldwide population - another 2-3% have schizotypal personality disorder
•
no great geographical variation
•
slight tendency for birth in winter or spring (virus?)
•

Syndrome
Psychosis – alteration in thoughts, perceptions, consciousness
•
Thought disorder - disconnected, loose thoughts
•
• Abnormal beliefs or delusions 
– persecution, reference, control,
– possession of thought
• Abnormal experiences/perceptions
– auditory hallucinations
• Mood disorders - depression, anxiety
• Motor alterations - restlessness, purposeless overactivity
Social function - withdrawal
•
• Negative - poverty of speech, poor attention span, flat affect, lack of motivation
Positive - delusions, hallucinations, bizarre or disorganized behaviors
•
• Catatonia - mutism, abnormal posture
Paranoia - persecution
•

SCHIZOPHRENIA
SCHIZOPHRENIA

Clinical History
• Onset - late adolescence, early adulthood
– positive symptoms often most evident in acute 
schizophrenic episode 
– negative symptoms may predominate in chronic illness
– quite variable
• Outcome
– acute symptoms often respond positively to antipsychotic 
drugs
– 25% may make full recovery
– 25% remain severely disturbed
– half may require long-term hospitalization
– 50% more or less severe disorder fluctuating over many 
years

John F. Nash Jr.

1994 Nobel Prize in Economics
“John F. Nash introduced the distinction between 
cooperative games, in which binding agreements can be 
made, and non-cooperative games, where binding 
agreements are not feasible. Nash developed an 
equilibrium concept for non-cooperative games that later 
came to be called Nash equilibrium.”

SCHIZOPHRENIA
SCHIZOPHRENIA
Hereditary Influences - Monozygotic twin concordance = 
50%; dizygotic = 15% (same as siblings)

•

lifetime probability is 10% in first-degree relatives vs. 1% 
in general population
– one parent = 13%
– two parents = 50%
• concordance rate for monozygotic twins similar whether 
reared together or not
• being adopted away from relatives with schizophrenia 
does not reduce risk
• higher in urban areas; higher for moving across cultures 
(stress?)
• multifactorial polygenic-environmental threshold model

Neuropathology

• enlarged lateral ventricles, 3d ventricles, widened 
sulci
• hippocampal involvement?
• hypofrontality sometimes seen in PET scans 
failure to increase frontal activation during Wisconsin 
•
card sorting task
• atypicality seen in behavior and brain of non-
psychotic first-degree relatives

•

Treatment
• neuroleptics
– block post-synaptic dopamine receptors & release of dopamine 
from presynaptic neurons
• drug is fully effective at receptors within hours but maximal clinical 
effect takes weeks and remain for weeks after treatment ends
side effects
– early on - parkinsonian symptoms (20-40%)
– later on - tardive dyskinesia (20%)
– abnormal involuntary movements - smacking lips, chewing, tongue 
protrusion
– clozapine (late 1980s) – no tardive dyskinesia, but other risks 
including live function, reduction in white cells, must be 
monitored, expensive
– behavioral therapy can enhance drug efficacy

Dopamine theory of schizophrenia
antipsychotics
•
amphetamine can induce something that looks like paranoid 
•
schizophrenia & it increases DA function
• weak & mixed results
• drug action vs. disease
