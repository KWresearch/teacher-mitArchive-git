KOSSLYN CHAPTER 11 – Psychological Disorders: More Than Everyday Problems 
IDENTIFYING PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS: mental conditions characterized by cognitive, 
emotiona l, and behavioral symptoms that : 
•	 Create significant distress 
o	 Ex: repeatedly bursting into tears, expressing hopelessness about the future, chronic
worry, profound sadness for long periods of time 
Impair work, schoo l, family, re lationships, or da ily living 
•	
•	 Lead to significant risk of harm, causing an individual to put  lives at risk (intentionally or 
accidentally) 
Cultural / Social Influences – determine what is “abnorma l” / “disordered” 
•	 Often changes from generation to generation as cultural norms shift over t ime 
•	 Varies from culture to culture 
Psychosis: severely impa ired ability to perceive, comprehend events accurate ly, combined with
grossly organized behavior
2 symptoms:
1.	 Hallucinations: menta l images so vivid that they seem rea l 
2.  Delusions: unshakable but false beliefs that are often bizarre 
Hallucinations, delusions should not be considered abnormal if they are an accepted part of culture 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) 
•  Manual of mental disorders designed to help clinicians diagnose and treat patients 
5 axes / types of informat ion that need to be considered when assessing a person’s problems: 
1.	 Clinical disorders (ex: anxiety disorders, schizophrenia) 
2.	 Personality disorders / mental retardation  (generally arise during childhood, persist throughout
life, can affect how symptoms of other disorders are expressed) 
3.	 Medical conditions relevant to diagnosis on Axis 1 or 2  (ex: food allergies) 
4.	 Social / environmental problems (ex: marital problems, home lessness) 
5.	 Patient’s highest level of functioning  in major areas of l ife within the past year 
17 Major Categories of Psychological Problems
1.	 Disorders usually first diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adolescence (ex: ADHD) 
2.	 Delirium, dementia, amnestic, etc. disorders  disorders of consciousness / cognition 
3.	 Mental disorders due to a genera l medical condit ion not e lsewhere classified 
4.	 Substance -related disorders 
5.	 Schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders 
6.	 Mood disorders 
7.	 Anxiety disorders 
8.	 Somatoform disorders  physical / medical complaints have  no  medical origin and so  are
thought to be psycho logical in nature (ex: hypochondriasis) 
9.	 Factitious disorders  person intentionally fabricates symptoms of medical / psychological 
disorders, but not  for external gain (ex: disability claims) 
10.  Dissociat ive disorders  disruption in usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, 
identity 
11.  Sexua l / gender identity disorders 
12.  Eating disorders 
13.  Sleep disorders (ex: insomnia) 
14.  Impulse-control disorders not elsewhere classified (ex: kleptomania) 
15.  Adjustment disorders  disorders related to the  development of distressing emotional,
behavioral symptoms in response to ident ifiable stress 
16.  Personality disorders  personality traits that are inflexible / ma ladaptive , cause distress /
difficulty with daily funct ioning 
17.  Other conditions that may be a  focus of clinical attention (ex: bereavement)

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 11 – Psychological Disorders: More Than Everyday Problems 

Advantages / Disdvantages
+/- Covers a tremendous number of disorders 
- Created psychological / psychiatric disorders for  medical problems (ex: “breathing-re lated sleep 
disorder vs. sleep apnea?) 
- Criteria  for different disorders overlap
+ Neutrality, makes no  assumptions about why disorders arise  or the best way to  treat them 
+ Includes standards that can be used to ensure reliability (consistency) in diagnoses
DSM-IV-TR  is  still  the  predominant  means  of  categorizing  psycho logical  disorders  in  the  US  
Explaining Psychological Abnormality
Explanations have changed w ith the times / reflect the va lues, knowledge of each culture

The Bra in:

Psychological disorders can increasingly be explained as arising in part from genet ics, abnormal

neurotransmitter function, abnormal structure and funct ioning of the bra in.

The Person: 

Learning maladaptive behaviors: classical conditioning, operant conditioning

Maladaptive thoughts, biases: mental events can bias what a person tends to pay attention to; 

influence the pattern of a person’s thoughts; affect the attributions that a person makes about 
the causes of positive / negative events 
The Group: socia l and cultural factors 
Stresses caused by other people / the physical environment
Culture / whether something is socia lly accepted as a disease / labe ls for diseases 
Factors at the levels of the brain, person, and group interact , and it  is the net effect of these factors that
ultimately gives rise to a disorder . 2 ways these factors may interact: 
•	 Diathesis-stress model: a predisposition to a given disorder (diathesis: genetic, brain-based) 
and specific factors (stress) combine to  trigger  the onset of the disorder 
o	 Even if a person has the genes, neurotransmitter activity, brain structure / function
associated with a disorder, without strong enough psychologica l / social stress, the
disorder will not be  likely to develop 
o	 When people experience stress those who are not genetically or neurologically
vulnerable for a given disorder are unlikely to develop that disorder 
o	 No single event / factor a lone  is likely to  lead to a psycho logical disorder! 
o	 Drawbacks: all types of stress are typically grouped together, so important differences
among the various types of stress w ill be overlooked / minimized; diasthesis and 
stress are viewed as dist inct factors that do not affect each other 
•	 Biopsychosocia l approach: psychologica l disorders are best  explained by considering a ll 3
types of factors (leve ls of the brain, person, group) separate ly as we ll as by understanding
their influences on each other 

MOOD DISORDERS: characterized by persistent / episodic disturbances in emotion that interfere
with normal functioning in at least one rea lm of life 
Major depressive disorders (MDD): 2 wks of depressed mood / loss of interest in nearly all activit ies;
sleeping / eating disturbances, loss of energy , fee lings of hope lessness 
•	 Affects the ABC’s  Affect (mood); Behavior (actions); Cognit ion (thoughts) 
•	 Most common psychological disorder in the US; American women > men 
•	 Different cultures don’t experience exactly the same symptoms of depression 

Please pardon any spelling errors or typos!

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 11 – Psychological Disorders: More Than Everyday Problems 
•	 Depression can lead to suicide. 
Dysthymia: similar to MDD, but less intense and longer last ing 
Bipolar Disorder: one  of more episodes of mania , or by alternating episodes of hypomania and
depression hypomania, often alternating with periods of depression; cycling of moods 
Manic Episode: period of at least 1 wk during which an abnorma lly elevated, expansive, or irritable 
mood persists
Hypomania: milder form of a manic episode , symptoms are less likely to interfere with function
Manic or hypomanic episodes are often preceded or followed by episodes of depression 
Explaining Mood Disorders
Bipolar disorder and MDD may arise  from a set of common underlying neuro logical and
psycho logical factors. 
The Bra in / Bio logical Factors
Depression 
•	 Genetics  Depression tends to run in families [ex: if one identical twin has MDD, the co-tw in 
is 4x more  like ly to experience depression]; Effects of genes are usually weak! 
•	 Malfunct ioning neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine)  not  much known! 
•	 Depressed people have unusually low activity in one area of the frontal lobe that has direct
connections to many brain areas involved in emotion (ex: amygdala). These parts of the frontal
lobe also have connections to brain structures that produce serotonin, epinephrine ,  dopamine  
Bipolar disorder 
•	 Genetics [ex: if one identical tw in has bipolar disorders, the co-tw in has an 80% chance of 
developing some kind of mood disorder] 
•	 Enlarged amygdala 
Shifts in temporal lobe activity during manic episodes that do no occur during other mood 
•	
states 
The Person 
Depression 
•	 Negative triad of depression  negat ive view of world; self; future 
•	 Cognitive distortions: systemat ic biases in how people think about events and others; perpetuate 
negative views 
•	 Attributional style : a persons’ characteristic way of explaining life events  affects risk of 
depression [ex: Blaming self]
Bipolar disorder  little is known; depressive attribut iona l style when in depressed phase of disorder 
The Group
Depression 
Stressful life events 
•	
Social iso lation 
•	
“Punishing” socia l relat ionships 
•	
•	 Cultural factors 
•	 Gender differences (may arise  from cultural factors)  boys and girls are taught to respond 
differently to stress
Bipolar disorder 
o  Stressful life events; disruptions in daily social rhythm of life  (ex:  sleeping  at  different  times)  
Interactional theory of depression  (James Coyne) 
1.	 The depressed person, genetica lly vulnerable to depression, has depressive thoughts and
feelings.

2.	 These thoughts and feelings lead the person to act in ways that a lienate  other  people  who
might otherw ise provide support. Actions that alienate others include: impulses that lead him
/ her to do or  say things that alienate  others who  can provide  support. 
o	
Seeking excessive reassurance 
o	
Seeking out negative feedback 
o	
Interpersonal aggression 
3.	 These actions then lead others to reject the depressed person, confirming that person’s
negative view of him/herself. Such reject ions and criticisms increase the  likelihood of negat ive
future events. 
4.	 The depressed person may then continue to seek out feedback from others, perhaps
attempting to determine whether such negat ive feedback was a fluke or to elicit reassurance
from others, which perpetuates the cycle. 
Being around depressed people may make you feel/act depressed because  the depressed person 
creates stress! 

ANXIETY DISORDERS: characterized by intense , pervasive anxiety or fear, or extreme  attempts  to  
avoid these fee lings
Generalized anxiety disorder: excessive  anxiety and worry that  is not  consistently related to  a 
specific object or situation 
Panic disorder: characterized by frequent, unexpected panic attacks or fear and avo idance of such 
attacks 
Panic attack: episode of intense fear, anxiety, or  discomfort accompanied by physical and
psycho logical symptoms such as pheart alpitations, breathing difficulties, chest pain, fear of
impending doom or of doing something uncontro llable , and a sense of unreality
Agoraphobia: condit ion in which people fear or avoid places that might be  difficult to leave should
panic symptoms occur
The Bra in 
•	 Genes –  people  can inherit a  biological vulnerability for  panic 
•	 Arise from excessively sensitive locus coeruleus (small group of cells deep in the brainstem
triggering an increased heart rate, faster breathing, sweating, other parts of the fight-or-flight 
response) 
•	 Changes in breathing: changes in carbon dioxide levels can a lso elicit panic… “suffocation
alarm” 
The Person 
•	 Anxiety sensitivity – be lief that  autonomic arousa l can have harmful consequences  higher 
risk of experiencing spontaneous (uncued) panic a ttacks 
4 step process:
1.	 Anxiety sensitivity leads people to become frightened by changes in the ir heart rate or
breathing rate. 
2.	
In turn, the ir fear causes the flight-or-fight response (which in turn increases heart rate 
and breathing rate). 
3.	 People with anxiety sensitivity then become afraid of the bodily sensations that
intensify with fear – what psychologists refer to  as a fear  of fear. 
4.	 When people have a fear of fear , they become hypervigilant for the bodily signals that
have previously led  to  panic  in  the  past.  Thus,  in  a  vicious  cycle ,  these  people  are  more  
likely to become anxious that they might have a panic attack, which in turn increases
the fight-or-flight response (including increased heart rate and breathing changes),
which then triggers  panic.  
The Group 
•	 Culture / environmenta l changes

9.00 EXAM 3 NOTES 
KOSSLYN CHAPTER 11 – Psychological Disorders: More Than Everyday Problems 

Phobia: exaggerated, irrat ional fear of a specific object, act ivity, or situation that leads the person to
go to extreme lengths to avoid the feared stimulus
Social phobia : fear of public humiliation or embarrassment, which leads the person to avoid 
situations like ly to arouse this fear
Specifc phobia: persistent and excessive or unreasonable fear triggered by a specific object or 
nonsocia l situation, a long w ith attempts to avoid the feared stimulus
The Bra in 
•	 Genetic vulnerability causes the amygdala / other fear-related brain structures to react too 
strongly in certain situations 
Identical twin + co-twin are both phobic… but not always, so there must be some other 
•	
nongenet ic factor?
The Person 
•	 Learning 
o	 Classica l condit ioning –  association between stimulus and fear 
o	 Operant conditioning – negat ive reinforcement 
o  Mixed findings 
The Group 
•	 Observational learning 
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD): characterized by presence of obsessions / compulsions 
Obsession: recurrent, persistent thought, impulse , or image that feels intrusive and inappropriate and
is difficult to suppress or ignore [ex: thoughts of germs / contamination]
Compulsion: repetit ive behavior or mental act tha t a person feels compelled to perform in response to 
an obsession [ex: excessive washing]
The Bra in 
•	 Genetic contribution, but no straightforward familial link 
•	 Obsessions and compulsions have been related to neura l act ivity that occurs in the basal
ganglia (obsessions occur when  this  area  doesn’t  turn  off  recurrent  thoughts  about  an  object  /  
situation)
The Person 
•	 OCD can arise when someone interprets his/her thoughts as conveying something
fundamentally negative about him/herse lf or as otherwise unacceptable, and then tries to 
suppress the offending thought 
•  Operant conditioning helps maintain OCD behavior via negative reinforcement
The Group 
•	 Culture , religious obsessions, praying compulsions 
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  (PTSD): experienced by some people after a traumatic event and 
characterized by persistent re-experiencing  of  the  trauma,  avoidance  of  st imuli  associated  with  the
trauma, and heightened arousal
3 criteria : 
1.	 Person experiences/w itnesses an event that involves actual/threatened serious injury/death 
2.	 Traumatized  person  responds  to  the  situation  with  fear ,  helplessness  
3.	 Traumatized person has 3 sets of symptoms: 
a.	 persistent reexperiencing of the traumatic event, which may take the form of intrusive ,
unwanted, and distressing recollections, dreams, or nightmares of the  event  or may
involve flashbacks that can include illusions, ha llucinat ions, and a sense of reliving the
experience 
b.	 persistent avoidance of anything associated with the trauma and a general emotional
numbing 
c.	 heightened arousal which can cause people with PTSD to startle easily, have difficulty
sleeping, or be in a constant state of hypervigilance 

The Bra in

9.00 EXAM 3 NOTES 
KOSSLYN CHAPTER 11 – Psychological Disorders: More Than Everyday Problems 
•	 Genes 
•	 Childhood trauma can enhance the fight-or-flight response , making it easier to trigger and
more pronounced; changes of levels of hormones related to stress response 
o	 Lower  levels of cort isol; when stressed, people w ith PTSD may not produce the high
levels of cortiso l that typically occur w ith the fight-or-flight response 
•	 Abnormal bra in structures: 
o	 Locus coeruleus: overly reactive 
o	 Limbic system: more easily activated by mental imagery of traumatic events 
o  Hippocampus: unusually small 
The Person 
•	 History of social withdrawal, depression 
Sense of not being able to control stressful events 
•	
•	 Belief that the person’s life  is at risk during the traumatic event or that s/he has no contro l 
over the situation 
•	 Prior belief that the world is a dangerous place 
•  Lower IQ  fewer  cognitive resources for  coping with trauma? 
The Group 
Support from friends, family members, etc. immediately after a trauma may help decrease the 
•	
likelihood that PTSD will develop 

SCHIZOPHRENIA: characterized by symptoms of psychosis that profoundly a lter the patient’s affect, 
behavior , and thoughts
Positive Symptoms: excess  /  distortion  of  normal  funct ions  (ex:  delusions  of  persecution, grandeur, 
reference , or control; hallucinat ions; disorganized behavior – inappropriate, childlike silliness or 
unpredictable agitation; disorganized speech)
Negative Symptoms: diminut ion / loss of normal funct ions (ex: restricted range of emot ional 
expression, flat affect – failure to express / outwardly respond to emot ion, alogia – slow, empty 
replies to questions, avo lition –  inability to  initiate  / persist  in goal-directed activities) 
Average onset – 20s; gradual development of symptoms 
Symptoms emerge gradua lly, beginning with a prodromal phase (period immediate ly before
symptoms fully emerge; slow ly deteriorating functioning, outbursts of anger , w ithdrawa l from other
people ; poor hygiene)  active  phase 
4 Subtypes
1.	 Paranoid – delusions of persecution are prominent; intellectua l functioning and affect are
relative ly intact, but auditory hallucinations are common 
2.	 Disorganized – disorganized speech / behavior, flat / inappropriate affect are prominent 
3.	 Catatonic – bizarre , immobile , re lentless motor behaviors are prominent 
4.  Undifferentiated – symptoms do not clearly fa ll into any of the above 3 subtypes 
The Bra in 
•	 Genetics 
Structural abnormalities – enlarged ventricles, reduction in size of other  parts of the bra in
•	
containing white / gray matter, including the frontal cortex, which plays a central role in 
abstract thinking and planning – from maternal malnourishment , maternal illness, maternal
stress during pregnancy, prenatal/birth-re lated medical complications that lead to fetal 
oxygen deprivation 
•	 Elevated levels of stress-related hormones (especially during adolescence) 
•	 Neurotransmitters  overproduction of dopamine as a  result of high levels of stress-re lated 
hormones? 
The Person 
•	 Trouble processing / responding to sensory stimuli  unusua l sensory experiences /
hallucinations (ex: seeing inanimate objects move of the ir own accord); trouble making sense
of stimuli, problems organizing what they are perceiving / experiencing 

Please pardon any spelling errors or typos!

9.00 EXAM 3 NOTES 
KOSSLYN CHAPTER 11 – Psychological Disorders: More Than Everyday Problems 
•  Difficulty with interpreting / using information in various contexts
The Group 
•	 Urban areas; lower socioeconomic classes  Social selection (aka social drift) –  the  tendency of 
the mentally disabled to drift to the lower economic classes; Social causation – the chronic 
psycho logical and social stresses of living in an urban environment may lead to  an increase in 
the rate of schizophrenia (especia lly among the poor) 
Family interactions – families with high expressed emotion: members are critica l, hostile , 
overinvolved 

•	

EATING DISORDER: disorders involving a severe disturbance  in eating behavior 
Anorexia nervosa : eating disorder characterized by the refusa l to maintain even low norma l we ight,
and an intense fear of ga ining we ight 
•  2 types: restricting type (undereating for weight loss); bing-eating/purging type 
Bulimia nervosa: eating disorder characterized by recurrent  episodes of binge  eating, fo llowed by
some attempt to prevent weight gain (vomiting, laxatives) 
•  2 types: purging; nonpurging
The Bra in 
•	 Genetic predisposit ion (but heritability varies wildly!) 
•	 Abnormal functioning of neurotransmitter serotonin 
•  Bio logical effects of dieting
The Person 
•	 Linked to personality-re lated characteristics, irrat ional beliefs  women who  are 
perfectionists, have unusually high leve ls of anxiety; have irrational beliefs and inappropriate  
expectat ions about their bodies, jobs, re lations, lives; “black-and-white”  /  dichotomous  
thinking; preoccupation with “ugly” over “beauty” 
•	 Negative reinforcement from eating disorder behaviors 
o	 Purging can temporarily relieve anxiety created by overeating 
o	 Preoccupations with food provide distractions from work, family conflicts, social
problems 
o  Restricting eating gives a sense of increased control 
The Group 
Family / culture 
•	

PERSONALITY DISORDERS: set  of re latively stable personality traits that are inflexible and 
maladaptive , causing distress or difficulty with da ily functioning
Some argue that personality disorders should not be disorders at all 
 Defining traits as disorders treats norma l variations in personality as pathological 
 Doing so creates separate Axis II categories for some conditions that could be part of an Axis I 
clinica l disorder. 
3 clusters: 
CLUSTER A –  odd, eccentric behaviors
Paranoid personality disorder –suspiciousness and distrust of others to the extent that other people’s 
motives are interpreted as ill-intent ioned. However, unlike the paranoid subtype of
schizophrenia, there are no de lusions or hallucinations
Schizoid personality disorder – detachment from social relationships, narrow range of displayed 
emotion 
Schizotypal personality disorder – extreme discomfort in close re lationships, odd / quirky behavior , 
cognitive / perception distortions (such as sensing the presence of another person or spirit) 

Please pardon any spelling errors or typos! 

7 

9.00 EXAM 3 NOTES 
KOSSLYN CHAPTER 11 – Psychological Disorders: More Than Everyday Problems 
CLUSTER B – emotional or dramatic behaviors 
Antisocial personality disorder – disregard / violation of the rights of others 
•	 Commiting illegal acts, lying, impulsivity, irresponsibility, physical aggression, reckless
disregard for the safety of others, indifference to  the suffering of others
The Bra in   familial; the genes predispose, the environment triggers [ex: child’s bio logical 
parents are criminals, if child is adopted into family of law-abiding  people ,  slight  increase  in
criminal behavior , if not, whopping increase!]; genes cause autonomic nervous system to be
underresponsive so that people are understimulated by “normal” behaviors, which leads them
to seek out highly arousing, thrilling activities
The Person  difficulty contro lling impulses, anger, difficulty understanding how others feel, 
engendering a lack of empathy 
The Group  insecure attachment to primary caregiver, abuse, neglect
Borderline personality disorder – instability in relationships, se lf-image , feelings; pronounced
impulsivity (ex: spending, substance abuse , sex, reckless driving, binge eat ing). Re lationships
are often characterized by rapid swings from idealizing another person to deva luing him or
her. Recurrent suicida l gestures, threats, se lf-mutilation, such as nonletha l cuts on the arm are
common, as are chronic feelings of emptiness. 
Histrionic personality disorder – excessive  attention seeking, expression of emotion 
Narcissistic personality disorder – exaggerated sense of self-importance , need of admiration, lack of 
empathy 
CLUSTER C –  anxious or fearful behaviors or  symptoms 
Avoidant personality disorder – socia l discomfort, feelings of inadequacy, hypersensitivity to negative 
evaluation 
Dependent personality disorder – clingy, submissive behavior due to an extreme need to be taken care of 
Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder – preoccupation with perfectionism , orderliness, and control
(but no obsessions or compulsions, as occur with OCD)
