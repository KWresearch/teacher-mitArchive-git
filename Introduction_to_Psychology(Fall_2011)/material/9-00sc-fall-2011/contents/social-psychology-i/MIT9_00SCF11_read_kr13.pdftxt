KOSSLYN CHAPTER 13 – Social Psychology: Meeting of the Minds 
SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY: focuses on how people perceive  and think about other  people (social
cognition) and interact in relationships and groups (socia l behavior) 

SOCIAL COGNITION: the ways that  people perceive the social world and how they attend to, store, 
remember , and use information about other people and the social world 
Attitude: an overa ll eva luation about some aspect of the  world 
•	 Affective: your feelings about the object / issue 
•	 Behavioral: your predisposit ion to act in a particular way toward people, objects, issues 
•	 Cognitive: what you believe or know about people, objects, issues 
Attitudes play in important role in how we process information and remember events. In ambiguous

social situations, our attitudes determine what information we pay attent ion to, process, and

remember . This is how people in the same socia l situation can come away with different

interpretations of what occurred.

Attitudes influence behavior , but they don’t always lead you to behave in ways that are consistent

with them. Attitudes are more like ly to shape behavior when they are strong, re latively stable,

directly relevant to  the behavior, important, or easily accessed from memory.

Behavior can also affect attitudes. Repeatedly asserting an attitude can make  the attitude stronger.

Cognitive dissonance : uncomfortable  state that arises from  a discrepancy between two  attitudes,

beliefs, or behaviors; accompanied by heightened arousal, people are motivated to reduce this

dissonance by resolving the conflict

Dissonance Reduction:

Festinger & Carlsmith (1959): people who were pa id less to tell someone that a boring task was

enjoyable reported afterward that they enjoyed the task more than those who were pa id a greater

amount.

•	 People who were paid little – to reduce  the  cognitive dissonance between their initial attitude 
and the ir behavior , they changed their attitude about the task so they did not view it as boring. 
•	 People who were paid a  lot –  didn’t feel cognitive dissonance; the money they received was 
adequate compensation for telling someone that they liked the task
The less reason a person has to engage in a behavior that is counter to an attitude, the stronger the
dissonance. 
Cognitive dissonance is only experienced when people believe that they have a cho ice and that they 
are responsible for the ir course of action and thus for any negat ive consequences. 
Methods of Reducing Dissonance: 
1.	
Indirect strategies –  trying to feel good about  ourselves in other  areas of life 
2.	 Direct strategies – changing our attitudes / behavior 
3.	 Trivialize an inconsistency between 2 conflicting a ttitudes as being unimportant, thereby
making it less like ly to cause cognit ive dissonance
Attempts to reduce dissonance can he lp explain why people who are genera lly not immora l may act
immora lly  change how they understand their immoral act; minimize responsibility for it; disregard
the negative consequences; blame / dehumanize the victims 
Persuasion: attempts to change people’s attitudes

Elaborate likelihood model of attitude change – 2  routes of persuasion:

1.	 Central – paying close attention to the content of the argument

9.00 EXAM 3 NOTES 
KOSSLYN CHAPTER 13 – Social Psychology: Meeting of the Minds 
2.  Periphera l – attempts to sway opinions based on the quantity or  attractiveness and expertise
of the sources… i.e.: ce lebrity endorsements
Mere exposure effect: the change –  generally favorable – in attitude that can result from simply
becoming familiar w ith something (ex: po litical campaigns)
Characteristics of Persuasive People – ident ity, fast talking, seems honest
You are more like ly to be persuaded if the message arouses strong emotions (ex: fear) and if it
includes specific advice about what you can do to bring about a more posit ive outcome . This does not
always bring about long-term changes in behavior . 
Ex: AIDS ads 
When and where the message is de livered always affects how persuasive  it  is. 
If you are not paying full attention to an attempt a t persuasion, you are  less likely to be
•	
persuaded by a rational argument that requires you to think deeply. But you are more like ly to
be persuaded by a simplistic argument because your inattention makes you less able to 
develop a counterargument . 
Social cognitive neuroscience: attempts to understand social cognition by specifying the cognitive
mechanisms that underlie it and by discovering how those mechanisms are rooted in the brain 
Lieberman et al. (2001) –  Do  people need to  be  consciously aware of cognitive dissonance  in order to
be motivated to reduce it? 
NO. 
•	 Even amnesic patients – who  immediately forgot having to  make the choice –  became more 
posit ive about the chosen object and more negative about the rejected one. 
Stereotype : be lief (or set of be liefs) about  people  in a particular category
Because stereotypes assign social information to a category, they can serve as useful cognitive
shortcuts. But stereotypes are often  caricatures,  sometimes  incorrect
We are less like ly to process, attend to, encode , remember information that is inconsistent w ith our
stereotypes. We tend to discard such information and preserve our stereotype.
Instead of changing the stereotype, we will create a new subtype within it to bridge the conflict
between the stereotype and the actual behavior of someone in the stereotyped group.
If you are motivated to be accurate and willing to exert extra cognitive effort , you can minimize the
impact of stereotypes by not assuming that a stereotype applies to a particular person.
You can change a stereotype when you think that a person’s behavior results from his / her
characteristics, not the situation. 
Prejudice: an attitude  (generally negative) towards members of a group 
1.	 Cognitive prejudice – be liefs, expectations about the group 
2.  Emot iona l prejudice –  negative fee lings toward the group
Information inconsistent with a prejudice  is less likely to be attended to and remembered accurately; 
prejudices are self-perpetuating 
Discriminat ion – effect of prejudiced behavior ; negative behavior  toward individuals from  a specific
group that arises from unjustified negative attitudes about that group; based on anything that
distinguishes groups
Becoming aware of the discrepancy between attitudes and behavior  leads to the discomfort of
cognitive dissonance , which can be reduced through changing future behaviors 
Why Does Prejudice Exist?
Realistic Conflict Theory – competition for scarce resources leads to increasingly negative views of the 
other groups; prejudices dissipate when compet ition is e liminated 
•  Ex: Robber’s Cave study
Social categorization theory –  cognitive operation that leads people to  sort  others automatically into
categories of “us” vs. “them” 
Social identity theory – socia l categorization is important because people usually think of their 
•	
own group (ingroup) favorably and usually think about the other group (outgroup)
unfavorably

o	 People not only dislike members of the outgroup, but a lso assume  that  they possess 
more undesirable traits 
•	 The ingroup is actively favored, and the outgroup is actively disfavored. 
Social categorization is efficient because once we’ve made an “us” vs. “them” distinction, we
•	
can then use our stereotypes about “us” vs. “them” to interpret  people’s behavior. This spares
us the effort of paying close attention to other people and of act ive ly processing our
observations of their behavior. 
Social categorization perpetuates prejudice because once we classify an individual as a 
member of an outgroup, we induce that person to act according to our stereotypes about the
outgroup.
Social Leaning theory – once  a prejudicial attitude is established, it can be  spread and passed through
generations as a learned stereotype 
Changing Prejudice
Increased contact / contact hypothesis – increased contact between different groups will decrease 
prejudice between them 
•	 Both groups are more like ly to become aware of similarit ies between the groups, which can
deemphasize differences, enhance mutual attraction 
•	 When faced with enough inconsistent information or except ions to the stereotypes, people can
change the stereotypes that give rise to their prejudice 
Increased change can shatter the  illusion that the outgroup is homogeneous
• 
Recategorization: shifting the  categories of “us”  and “them” so that the 2  groups are  no  longer 
distinct entit ies 
Mutual interdependence –  each member’s contribution is a  piece of the whole , each person depends on
others (ex: jigsaw classroom) 
Attributions: explanations for the causes of events or behaviors 
Internal attributions (aka dispositional attributions): expla in a person’s behavior in terms of 
1.	
their preferences, beliefs, goals or other characteristics 
2.	 External attributions (aka situational attributions): expla in a person’s behavior in terms of the 
situation 
Attributional biases: tendencies to make certain types of attributions; genera lly occurs outside of
conscious awareness; function as shortcuts to reduce the cognitive load required to make sense of the
world 
3 types:
1.	 Fundamental Attribution Error (aka correspondence bias) – strong tendency to interpret other
people’s behavior as arising from internal causes rather than external ones 
a.	 Ex: juries who hear that the defendant confessed to the crime after many hours of 
tough, coercive questioning by police – even if judge throws out  confession, jurors are
more likely to vote guilty than those who had not heard the test imony. The jurors can’t 
just erase their attributions from the ir memories. 
b.	 Helps perpetuate discrimination because fault is a ttributed to the person, not to the 
circumstances 
c.	 Once a fundamenta l attribut ion error affects your understanding of why a person
behaved a certain way, you are likely to continue  to make internal, rather than external,
attribut ions and to ignore situational factors that give rise to future behaviors 
mult iplies error! 
d.	 Fundamental attribution errors also apply to yourself as we ll. 
2.	 Self-serving bias: a  person’s inclination to  attribute his/her  own fa ilures to external causes 
and own successes to internal causes, but to attribute other people’s fa ilure to internal causes
and their successes to external causes 
3.	 Belief in a just world: assumes that people  get what they deserve 
a.	 Ex: rape cases – victims deserved it 3

SOCIAL BEHAVIOR  
 
Relationship –  Why are you attracted to some people and not others? 
Physical  attraction 
Repeated contact –  leads you to  think more positive ly about  that  person 	  
Similarity – in attitudes, activit ies, styles of communicat ion  attraction  
 
Love ≠ very strong liking  
Companionate  love: altruist ic type  of love characterized by expending time , attention, and resources 
on behalf of another  person (ex: parents love for their  children)  
Passionate  love: intense, often sudden fee ling of being “in love,” which typically involves sexual 
attraction, a desire  for mutual love and physica l closeness, arousal, and a fear that the relat ionship 
will end 
 
Triangular  model of love : theory that  love has 3 dimension –  passion; intimacy, commitment  
 
Attachment styles – manner  of behaving w ith and thinking about  a partner   
3 types for adults: 
1.  Secure (59%)–  adults seek closeness and interdependence in relationships, are  not  worried 
about possibly losing the relationship because they feel secure  in it  
2.  Avoidant  (25%) –  uncomfortable w ith intimacy, closeness 
3.  Anxious-ambivalent  (11%) – adults who  want , but  simultaneously fear a  relationship 
 
Evolutionary Reasons for Mate  Select ion 
Men  physical attract iveness: women with well-proport ioned bodies, symmetrical features signa l 
fertility, health 
Women  attractive men can protect  and nourish them and their children (i.e.: good earning 
potentia l)  
 
Non-Evolutionary Reasons  
Romantica lly popular men were  seen as confident , outgoing, trend-setting; but were not seen as like ly 
to succeed financially or as be ing the best leaders (evolutionary favored qualit ies)  
When women achieve  economic power , their  preference in maters is more similar  to men’s - physica l 
attractiveness becomes more important.  
Culture : what are  considered attractive  body types change with time  
 
Group: social ent ity characterized by regular  interaction among members, some  emotional connection,  
a common frame  of reference, and a degree of interdependence   
•  Norms: rules that implicitly or  explicit ly govern members of a group; shared beliefs that are  
enforced through the  group’s use  of sanctions (penalties); can change  (ex: att itudes about 
drugs, alcohol, sex)  
Roles: behaviors that members in different  positions in a group are expected to perform  
Stanford Prison Experiment –  we can slip into a ro le without intending to  do so  
Students assigned to be either guards or  prisoners. 
•  “Prisoners” quickly began to behave passively, as if they realized that because they had no 
control over what  happened to  them, they should stop trying 
•  “Guards” began to  act as if they had genuine  power over  the prisoners, explored the limits of 
their power   
•  Prisoners eventually staged a rebellion, Guards responded w ith force  / put  prisoners in 
solitary confinement   
Students slipped easily and quickly into  the ir opposing roles.  
Assuming a role  in a  group can have profound effects!

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 13 – Social Psychology: Meeting of the Minds 
Conformity: change  in beliefs or behavior  in order to fo llow  a group’s norms 
Informational social influence : we  conform  to others because we  believe  that  the ir views are 
1.	
correct or the ir behavior is appropriate for the situation 
a.	 Occurs most often when: situation is ambiguous, there is a crisis, task is very difficult ,
other people are experts ’s views  / behavior because we want to be right and we 
believe that they are correct 
2.  Normative social influence : we conform because we want to be liked or thought of positively 
a.	 Solomon Asch – you are in a  group w ith 5 confederates; they give  you the  wrong
answer , what do you do?
i. 	 76% went along with confederates at least once; overall, 33% of the total
responses conformed w ith the obviously wrong majority 
ii.	 Participants wanted the sense of belonging to the group, and didn’t like to
contradict other group members publicly. 
iii.	 When they had to write down their answers, participants gave the correct 
response 98% of the time 
3.	 Social support – if another  group member  openly disagrees w ith the  group consensus, 

conformity is less likely

4.	 Culture – co llect ivist cultures have higher leve ls of conformity 
Compliance: a change in behavior  prompted  by  a  direct  request  rather  than  by  socia l  norms  
Principles
1.	 Friendship/liking – People are more like ly to comply with a request from a friend than from a 
stranger 
2.	 Commitment/consistency –  people  tend to be  more  likely to comply when the  request is

consistent w ith an idea or goal that they’ve previously embraced

3.	 Scarcity –  people  are more  likely to  comply with requests related to  limited, short-term

opportunities, rather than open-ended opportunit ies

4.	 Reciprocity – people tend to comply w ith a request that comes from  someone  who has

provided a favor

5.	 Social validation – people are more likely to comply if they think that others similar to

themse lves would comply

6.	 Authority –  people tend to  comply with a  request  if it comes from someone who  appears to be 
in authority
Techniques
Foot-in-the-door technique: achieves compliance by beginning with an insignificant request , which is
then followed by a larger request; works because people want to seem consistent
Lowball technique : getting someone to  make an agreement and then increasing the cost of that 
agreement
Door-in-the-face technique : someone makes a very large request, and then, when it  is denied, as
expected, makes a smaller request (for what is actually desired); works because of reciprocity 
Obedience: compliance  with an order
The Milgram Study –  you are  the  teacher , must administer  increasing shocks to  confederate student
when he incorrectly memorizes a list of pa irs of common words 
•	 Willingness of so many part icipants to obey orders to hurt others is disturbing ~ 
Foot-in-the-door technique… teachers start out at  trivial vo ltages 
•	
•	 People are more  like ly to obey a request if it comes from someone in authority (i.e .: obedience
fell to 20% if college student gave instructions, instead of white-coated experimenter) 
•	 Proximity to the  learner or experimenter also affected obedience [ex: applying electrode
directly to their skin  decreased obedience ; experimenter telephones commands 
decreased obedience]

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 13 – Social Psychology: Meeting of the Minds 
Decision Making in Groups:
Majority-win rule: If a  group is not  initially unanimous in favor  of a  particular decision, it is like ly tha t
the view favored by the majority w ill preva il
Truth-win rule: the objectively correct answer 
Group polarization: the tendency of group members’ opinions to become more extreme (in the same 
direction as their  initial opinions) after group discussion
Occurs because: 
1.	 Some members of the group may give many very compe lling reasons for the ir initial views 
2.	 Once a consensus is established, members take a more extreme position in accordance with the 
group norm to increase their standing in the group or improve their view of themselves 
3.	 Group members who have more extreme positions take more  turns in the discussion and
spend more time talking 
Groupthink: group process that when people who try to so lve problems together to accept one
another’s information and ideas w ithout subjecting them to critical analysis
Groups tend to make poorer decisions when they are iso lated from outside guidance , when the group
leader is vocal about his/her opinion and expects others to go along, and when the members like each
other and have a shared sense of identity. In such circumstances, members want to cooperate , and
refrain from asking questions or making comments that might lead to conflict or controversy. 
Social loafing: occurs when some members don’t contribute as much to a shared group task as do
others, and instead let other members work proportionally harder than they do 
To avo id: instill each person w ith a sense of importance, responsibility; make each member clearly 
responsible for a part icular task; make tasks attractive 
Social facilitation: increase in performance that can occur simply as a result of being part of a group
or in the presence of other people (presence of others increases arousal); occurs for we ll-learned, 
simple tasks; hinders performance on complicated, less well-learned tasks 
Altruism: motivation to  increase  another’s welfare 
Prosocial behavior : acting a ltruistically, which includes sharing, cooperating, comforting, and 
helping others
Characteristics of helpers: 
•	 High agreeableness, high need for approval, predisposition to  take personal and social
responsibility, tendency to fee l concerned for others, belief in a just world, less concern for our
own welfare 
We are more likely to help if helping is reinforced, we see others helping, we’re in a good mood.

We are more likely to help people we view as similar to ourse lves, friends or people we like , people

we believe are not responsible for the ir predicaments or give socia lly acceptable  justification for

his/her plight.

We are more likely to help in situations where the cost of helping is relatively low, rewards of he lping

are relatively high, there is an increased cost of not helping (ex: shame, guilt)

Bystander effect: the  decrease in offers of assistance that occurs as the number of bystanders increases
Cho ice points / Steps of bystander intervention: 
1.	
Is an emergency actually noticed by the bystander? 
2.	
Is the bystander correctly perceiving the event as an emergency? 
3.	 Does the bystander assume responsibility to intervene? 
4.	 Does the bystander know what to do , how to be helpful? 
5.  Is the bystander motivated enough to he lp, despite possible negative consequences?
Diffusion of responsibility : diminished sense o f responsibility to help that each person feels as the 
number of bystanders grows up
