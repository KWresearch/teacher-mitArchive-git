Explain conformity and obedience. What are the two famous experiments that
demonstrated conformity and obedience?
âº Sample answer
Conformity is when someone changes beliefs or behavior due to how other people
around them are behaving. This may be due to believing the other people's
beliefs and behavior are more accurate or appropriate, or it may be due to
wanting to be liked by others. Asch's line experimented conformity by having
confederates give incorrect answers about the comparable length of two lines.
When confederates gave the wrong answer, participants were more likely to
conform and give an obviously incorrect answer.
Obedience is when people conform to those in authority. Obedience does not need
to occur due to believing a person's actions are correct. Obedience is
demonstrated in Milgram's shock experiment. People obeyed the experimenter and
continue to increase the strength of an electric shock given to another
participant to the point of extreme pain. There was actually no shock or other
participant.
