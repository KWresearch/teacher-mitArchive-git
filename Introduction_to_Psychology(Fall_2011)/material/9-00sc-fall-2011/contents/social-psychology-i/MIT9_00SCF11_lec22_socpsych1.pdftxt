A tendency to believe that a behavior 
is due to a person’s disposition rather 
than the situation in which the person 
finds him/herself.

master” or “contestant”

• Quiz master came up with questions which the 
contestant had to answer.

• For example: Who were the two inventors of 
calculus?
[Answer:  Newton and Leibniz]

• This setup gave a huge advantage to the for quiz 
masters! 40% correct for contestents

Automatic and controlled processes
Automatic and controlled processes

• Dispositional inferences are made automatically.
• Situational information is processed in a separate, 
resource-dependent stage following attribution of 
behavior to dispositions. This is a controlled 
process.
• It takes energy and effort to “correct” the initial 
dispositional attribution.
• Thus, distraction should interfere with ability to 
take situational influences into account.

• Participants watched 7 silent video clips of a 
woman having a discussion with a stranger, 
she looks extremely anxious in 5 clips, on 
experimenter-assigned topics.

• Task: We want you to tell us how anxious this 
person typically is (dispositional trait anxiety).

• Independent variables: (1) subjects were told the 
target was discussing anxiety or relaxing inducing 
topics; (2) subjects were just asked to view the 
clips (unregulated), or were told they would later 
need to remember the topics (regulated).

Social influence

A change in a person’s behavior or 
beliefs in response to the intentional 
or unintentional influence of others. 

Three major kinds 
of social influence
• Conformity:  Changing one’s behavior or 
beliefs in response to explicit or implicit 
pressure from others.
• Compliance: Changing one’s behavior 
or beliefs to avoid conflict.
• Obedience: Changing one’s behavior or 
beliefs in response to the demands of a 
more powerful person. 

Conformity

• We conform to implicit as well as 
explicit social rules.
• Conformity is necessary for social 
coordination, and thus for civilization.
• Conformity can be seen across 
individuals, across the lifespan, and 
across cultures.

Conformity:
Sherif’s autokinetic effect

• Participants reported for a study on visual 
perception.
• They were seated in a dark room and saw a point 
of light appear, move, then disappear.
• Participants were asked to judge how far the light 
moved.
• The light never actually moved – the apparent 
movement was due to a perceptual illusion 
known as the “autokinetic effect.”

• The need to be liked

• need for consistency of behavior

Obedience

We obey our parents, the police, our 
bosses, and fire-fighters.
Obedience is necessary for social order,  
and thus for civilization.
Obedience (in varying levels) can be 
seen across individuals, across the 
lifespan, and across cultures.

Obedience

World War II and 
the subsequent 
claims by those 
who carried out the 
Holocaust:  
They were “just 
following orders.”

Milgram’s obedience studies
• Prior to the study, a panel of experts 
agreed that only a tiny fraction of 
participants would give the highest 
level of shock in this context.
• The key finding: fully 65% of 
participants actually gave the highest 
level of shock.
• Many participants expressed 
discomfort, but not a single participant 
effectively disobeyed (100% to 100 v).

WOULD THIS HAPPEN TODAY 
(WOULD YOU DO THIS)?
• Burger, 2009
• screened subjects
• told 3 times that they could stop 
and still get $50 for participating
• instant debriefing
• clinical psychologist present - end 
session if subject seemed distressed
• stop at 150 volts as good estimate 

WOULD THIS HAPPEN TODAY 
(WOULD YOU DO THIS)?
• Burger, 2009
• Milgram - 79% went to 150 volts
• now - 70%
• no difference between men and 
women 

Why are we so obedient?

Authority figure has a 
high status

Subordinates believe 
that authority figure, not 
themselves, are 
responsible for their 
actions

No clear-cut point to 
switch to disobedience 

Many obedience 
situation have gradual 
escalation – following 
orders first has only mild 
consequences; more 
harmful effects happen 
only later

Strong tendency to 
obey direct commands

Stanford Prison Experiment
• Social situations are governed by implicit and 
explicit rules (or norms).
• To explore how these rules create social reality, 
Zimbardo enrolled 24 healthy volunteers in a 
two-week “study of prison life.”
• Participants were randomly assigned to be 
either “guards” or “prisoners.”
• Guards became sadistic, and prisoners had 
such extreme stress responses that the study 
was terminated after only 6 days.

Image removed due to copyright restrictions. Please see http://www.prisonexp.org/.

Stanford Prison Experiment (1971).  Guards marching 
prisoners on a toilet run, bags over their heads, legs 
chained together. 

Planned as two-week prison simulation.  Study ended prematurely 
after six days. The guards were escalating their abuse of prisoners in 
the middle of the night when they thought no researchers were 
watching.  Prisoners were showing signs of extreme psychological
stress and distress.

Images removed due to copyright restrictions. Please see http://www.prisonexp.org/.

Two months after the study, here is the reaction of 
prisoner #416 who was placed in solitary confinement 
for several hours by guards: 

"I began to feel that I was losing my identity, that the 
person that I called "Clay," the person who put me in 
this place, the person who volunteered to go into this 
prison -- because it was a prison to me; it still is a 
prison to me. I don't regard it as an experiment or a 
simulation because it was a prison run by 
psychologists instead of run by the state. I began to 
feel that that identity, the person that I was that had 
decided to go to prison was distant from me -- was 
remote until finally I wasn't that, I was 416. I was really 
my number."

The bystander effect

• Selfish voyeuristic bystanders?
• Apathy of urban culture?
• Anonymity of modern life?
• Fear of getting hurt?

…or is it something else?
… what would YOU have done?

The bystander effect

• Latane and Darley conducted a series of 
experimental studies.
• Pluralistic ignorance:  Each witness was uncertain 
whether there was a real emergency, saw the others 
not reacting, and decided it must not be a real 
emergency.
• Diffusion of responsibility:  Each person felt 
someone else must be getting help, if help is in fact 
needed.

HELPING SOMEONE 
HAVING A SEIZURE
• Darley & Latane, 1968
• arrive for an experiment to discuss 
personal problems - 1-4 people over an 
intercom  - one member (confederate) 
appears to have a seizure

HELPING SOMEONE
