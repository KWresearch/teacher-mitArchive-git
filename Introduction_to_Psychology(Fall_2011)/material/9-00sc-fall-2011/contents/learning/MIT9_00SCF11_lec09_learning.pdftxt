LEARNING

• how behavior changes within the 
lifespan of an individual
• everything we know that is not 
genetically given
• how to predict the future on the basis
of past experience
• to imbue the world with meaning
• learning about learning through 
scientific psychology

• Nobel Prize for reflexes of digestion - food in 
mouth provokes specific salivation to prepare 
for digestion - salivation reflexes

"But Professor, there's a revolution going on with 
shooting in the streets."
"What difference does it make when you've work 
to do in the laboratory?  Next time there's a 
revolution, get up earlier!“

• cut esophagus so food could not go to stomach
• placed food in dog's mouth, stomach secreted 
plenty of gastric juice 
• sight of food or sight of feeder - psychic 
secretions or conditioned reflex

• Unconditioned Stimulus 
(UCSUCS) – food
• Unconditioned Response 
(UCRUCR) - salivating (food)
• Conditioned Stimulus 
(CSCS) – bell
• Conditioned Response
(CRCR) – salivating
• new association !!
bell (CS) & salivating (CR)
• law of association by contiguity
(Aristotle)

Water Demo

• Unconditioned Stimulus 
(UCSUCS) - water in face
• Unconditioned Response 
(UCRUCR) - flinching to water
UCS-UCR association is built-in reflex
• Conditioned Stimulus 
(CSCS) - hearing “CAN”
• Conditioned Response
(CRCR) - flinching to “CAN”
• new association !!
CAN (CS) & flinching (CR)

Balloon Demo

• Unconditioned Stimulus 
(UCSUCS) - balloon noise
• Unconditioned Response 
(UCRUCR) - flinching
UCS-UCR association is built-in reflex
• Conditioned Stimulus 
(CSCS) - needle touching balloon
• Conditioned Response
(CRCR) - flinching to needle
• new association !!

• consequences of responses
• operant response is an action that operates 
on environment to produce some 
consequence
• Beyond Freedom and Dignity
• operant behavior

classical conditioning CS elicits CR
instrumental conditioing CRs are emitted -
CRs = operants
create the CRs

OPERANT CONDITIONING
• novel response?
successive approximations & shaping

CONTINGENCY

• 2-month-old infant/crib/color mobile
• moving head, switch in pillow/smile & 
coo
• second group/no control/no smile, no 
coo despite equal number of mobile 
turns 

Reward Value
• negative contrast

What happens when you switch 
to a worse reward?

DELAYED GRATIFICATION
• 4-5 year-old children – 653 children 
of faculty and graduate students 
• two snacks
one or two marshmellows
• wait 15 minutes to get two – 30% 
waited 15 minutes
• correlated 10 years later with
behavioral problems, academic and 
social success (210 SAT points for 
30 sec vs. 15 min delay)

Conditioned Skill?
• 1 month - switch inside rubber nipple - hooked to tape 
recorder - when baby sucks, tape plays - ba ba ba vs. 
pa pa pa - may not be in their own language 
(Kikuyu/Spanish) and which their parents may be 
unable to distinguish (Czech, Hindi, Inslekampx)
• at 4 days, a French baby prefers French to Russian, 
Italian, backwards French
• correction/reinforcement?
2-year-old: "Mamma isn't boy, he a girl."
Mother" "That's right."
• generative - sentences are produced that are unique
• everybody learns it without training
• overgeneralizing - "My teacher holded the rabbit."
