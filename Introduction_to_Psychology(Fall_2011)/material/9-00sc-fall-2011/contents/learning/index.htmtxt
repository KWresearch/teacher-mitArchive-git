***** Session Overview *****
                                      How do we learn? How do the things we
                                      learn help us to survive and
                                      successfully interact with our
                                      environment? In this session, we will
                                      examine different types of learning,
                                      from classical conditioning to more
                                      complex models of learning, and how they

***** Discussion: Learning *****
Habituation is when repeated exposure to a stimulus decreases an organism's
responsiveness to the stimulus. What are some things in life that we experience
over and over again and react less and less to? What's an example of
habituation in real life?...Â Read_more_Â»
***** Check Yourself *****
Example 1:
In a study by Lewicki (1985) students had a brief interaction with a female
experimenter that had short hair and glasses. After the students asked the
experimenter a question she responded either in a negative way or a neutral
way. Afterword the students had to approach one of two other experimenters in a
different room. One experimenter shared more physical characteristics with the
first experimenter and the other shared fewer characteristics with the first
experimenter. Students were more likely to avoid the experimenter ion the
second room that resembled the first when the first responded negatively to
their question.
Example 2:
In the case of Pavlov's dog, the dog learned to salivate when the dog heard a
specific tone, but not similar tones that were never directly associated with
food. Name and explain the two psychological processes that describe the
situation in both example studies. Come up with another example of each of the
two psychological processes.
âº Sample Answer
The first study is an example of generalization. This is when a person or
animal learns to respond to stimuli that resemble the original conditioned
stimulus. Generalization allows a person or animal to predict that situations
similar to the stimulus that was originally associated with an outcome will
yield the same results.
The second study is an example of discrimination. This is when even though the
new stimuli are similar to the conditioned stimulus, people and animals can
tell that they are different enough to not yield the same outcome. This allows
people or animals to predict that situations similar, but different to the
stimulus that was originally associated with tan outcome will yield different
results.
One example of generalization is being rewarded for doing a great job on your
homework and generalizing to all situations that require effortful work on your
part. You then expect to be rewarded in other similar situations that require
work. One example of discrimination is leaning to shake hands when you first
formally meet someone in one culture, but realizing the same situation in
another culture may not require shaking hands.
