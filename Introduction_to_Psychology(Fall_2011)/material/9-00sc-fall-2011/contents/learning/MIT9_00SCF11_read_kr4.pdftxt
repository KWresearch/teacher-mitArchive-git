KOSSLYN CHAPTER 4 – Learning: How the Experience Changes Us 
Learning – the acquisition of information or  a behaviora l tendency that persists over a  relative ly long
period of time 
•	 Typically changes behavior 
•	 Long-term –  once you learn to  read, you remember it for the rest of your life! 
•	 Learning some elements of a task ≠ learning  to  do  the  task  itself.  
•	 Helps us survive and underlies most of our behavior 
•	 Does not a lways yield positive results! 
2 types of learning:
1.	 Associative learning – occurs when one object or  event becomes associated with another  object 
or event 
2.	 Nonassociative learning – does not rely on the association between two or more objects or
events; occurs when repeated exposure to the same stimulus alters how an animal responds to
that stimulus 
a.	 Habituation – occurs when repeated exposure  to a  stimulus decreases  
responsiveness to that stimulus 
b.	 Sensitization – occurs when repeated exposure to  a stimulus increases
responsiveness 
CLASSICAL  CONDITIONING  –  a  neutral  stimulus  becomes  pa ired  (associated)  with  a  stimulus
that causes a reflexive behavior, and in time, is sufficient to produce that behavior 
Pavlov’s Experiments – salivation in dogs
Phases of Classical Conditioning 
•	 Unconditioned st imulus – elicits an automatic response that does not depend on prior learning 
(ex: food) 
•	 Unconditioned response  (UR) – reflexive or automatic response elicited by a US  (ex: salivat ion) 
o	 Does not require learning, but depends on certain circumstances 
•	 Conditioned st imulus (CS) – an origina lly neutral  stimulus that  comes to  produce  a response
evoked by a US After it has been paired enough times w ith that US (ex: hearing tone while 
being fed  associate tone w ith food) 
•	 Conditioned response (CR) –  aka acquisit ion – response that depends / is conditional on
pairings of CS w ith US ; once learned, CR occurs when CS is presented alone (ex: salivation 
with tone , but no food) 
o	 Acquisit ion – in classical conditioning, the initial learning of the CR 
Variations of the Procedure 
Timing between CS and US 
Forward conditioning – CS  begins before  the  US  begins 
•	
o	
In order to create the CR, the US must immediately fo llow the CS . 
•	 Backward pairing –  US  comes first, followed quickly by the CS 
o	 When Pavlov tried to reverse the order, condit ioning did not occur –  fed dogs first, and 
then presented tone 1, 5, or 10 s later… dogs did not salivate when hearing the tone 
after eating the food 
o	 Pavlov couldn’t get backward pa iring, but other researchers have found it in very
specific circumstances 
Simultaneous conditioning – presenting US and CS simultaneously 
o  Usually does not lead to a CR, but condit ioning is possible under specific 
circumstances 
Forward conditioning is the most like ly to lead to classical conditioning 
When there is a de lay between the CS and the US, condit ioning can occur , but not very well. For best
results, US must be presented immediately after the CS.

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 4 – Learning: How the Experience Changes Us 
Classical Conditioning: Variations on a Theme
Avoidance learning –  CS  is pa ired w ith unpleasant US  that  leads organism to  avoid CS 
•	 Vladimir Bechterev – pairing bell (CS) w ith shock, dog learned to withdraw food (CR) a fter be ll 
but before shock (i.e.: learning to avo id pain) 
Show that CRs can affect motor reflexes 
•	
Conditioned Emotions: Getting a Gut Response
Conditioned emot iona l response –  emotionally charged response e licited by previously neutral 
stimulus 
•  Watson & Rayner –  classical conditioning can produce a straightforward CER;  fear can  lead to a : 
Phobia –  irrational fear  of a  specific object or situation 
Preparedness and Contrapreparedness
Bio logical preparedness – built-in readiness for certain previously neutral stimuli to come to elicit 
particular CR, which means that less conditioning (training) is necessary to produce learning
when these neutral stimuli are pa ired w ith the appropriate conditioned responses 
•  Ex: eating a particular kind of cheese for the 1st t ime and feeling nauseated  aversion 
It is easier to condition a fear response to some objects than to others. 
Contrapreparedness –  built-in disinclinat ion (or even inability) for certain st imuli to e licit particular 
CR 
•	 Ex: woman who sees a snake, but gets a car door  slammed  on  her  hand   fear  of snake, not  of 
car door which had actually done damage 
Extinction and Spontaneous Recovery in Classical Conditioning: Gone Today , Here Tomorrow
Extinction –  CR is gradually eliminated by repeated presentations of CS  without  US  
•  Production of new  learning interferes with previous classically conditioned response
Spontaneous Recovery – CS again e licits CR after  extinction has occurred… although CR may not be
as strong as before
When the animal is retrained so that the CS again elicits the CR, learning takes place more quickly 
than it did during the original training period  the connection between the CS and US does not 
vanish! 
Generalization and Discrimination in Classical Conditioning: Seen One, Seen ‘Em All?
Stimulus genera lization –  tendency for  CR to  be  elicited by neutral stimuli that  are similar, but not
identical, to the CS 
•	 Generalization gradient –  the  more  closely the new stimulus resembles the  original CS, the 
stronger the response
Stimulus discrimination – ability to distinguish among stimuli that are re latively similar to  the  CS  and
to respond only to the actual CS 
Cognition and the Conditioned Stimulus
Numerous mental processes typically are engaged between the time of the initia l presentation of the
CS and its eventual ability to elicit a CR. These can influence the learning that occurs: 
•	 Attention to the st imuli 
•	 Expectations that arise follow ing the CS influence 
Differences in conditioning occur because : 
•	 CS provides information by heralding the upcoming US (And therefore UR), and condit ioning
occurs because the animal learns that re lationship. The CS is an indicator that the US w ill
occur , at least in the particular context in which the conditioning took place. 
Idea that has less support: CS provides information about the upcoming US . (Classical 
conditioning takes place only if the pairing of CS and US provides useful information about
the likelihood that the US w ill occur .)

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 4 – Learning: How the Experience Changes Us 

Strongest evidence for the role of mental processes in conditioning: mental images of an object 
function as either CS or US 
•	 Ex: imagining food can produce sa livation  visual mental imagery relies on most of the
mental processes used during visual perception, so conditioning that arises from perceiving a
stimulus generalizes to imagining it 
All of this provides evidence for: placebo effect. 
Dissecting Conditioning: Brain Mechanisms
Learning to Be Afraid
1.	 Stimuli registered by brain 
2.	 Amygdala reacts – the result of classical conditioning is that sets of neurons in the amygdala 
become linked to the neurons that respond to the  stimulus
When the CS later occurs, these stimulus-response associations are act ivated, and the amygdala sends
signals to parts of the brain that actually produce the behaviors that express fear and conditioned fear.
The amygda la automatically triggers the CR, and this linked activity never disappears entire ly, so 
relearning a conditioned fear response is easy. 
More Than One Type of Conditioning
Numerous types of conditioning exist, each of which relies on different mechanisms. Depending on 
the particular characteristics of the underlying brain mechanisms, conditioning is more or less easily
acquired and extinguished. 
Ex: eye-blink conditioning re lies on cerebellum , which plays a key role in forming and storing the 
conditioned associations / producing the eye-blink itself 
Classical Conditioning Applied
Drug Use and Abuse
Overdose :

A user who generally takes a drug in a part icular setting (ex: bathroom) typically develops a CR to

that place.

Conditioned compensatory response – as the user walks into the bathroom, the ir body beings to

compensate for the influx of drug that is soon to come
CR is the body’s attempt to counteract / dampen the effect of the drug.
When the user takes the drug in a new setting (ex: friend’s  living  room),  compensatory  response  does
not occur. With no conditioned compensatory response to the new setting, the user’s body
does not try to counteract  the effect of the drug. In this new setting, the net result  is a higher
dose of the drug, which may be higher than the user can tolerate  overdose! 
Addict ion:

People addicted to cocaine can experience drug cravings merely from handling money.

•	 CS = handling money 
•	 Virtual CSs can induce cravings. 
•	 Certain environmental stimuli can act as CSs as well. 
Therapy Techniques
Classica l condit ioning to treat phobias: 
•	 According to classical conditioning principles, phobias are condit ioned emotional responses,
and thus treatment can be designed to disrupt the associat ions learned through classical
condit ioning

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 4 – Learning: How the Experience Changes Us 
Systematic desensitization – structured and repeated presentation of a feared CS in circumstances
designed to reduce anxiety 
1.	 Relax 
2.	 Continue to relax when exposed to feared CS 
3.	 CS no longer elicits CR 
Exposure – treatment technique that works by repeatedly  presenting  the  patient  with  a  fear-eliciting
CS in a planned and systematic way; similar to systematic desensit ization, without first
inducing relaxation 
•	 After exposure to feared stimulus, patients will learn that their fear response will decrease 
natura lly (because of habituation) , and that nothing terrible happens as a result of contact
with the feared stimulus 
Advertising
Sex appeal to increase sales: 
•	 US = some type of sexua lly arousing st imulus 
•  UR = mild to strong sexual arousa l
Other examples: food (US) and po litical slogans (CS)
Evaluative conditioning – the goa l is to  change your liking, or evaluation of the CS –  the  product  tha t 
advertisers want you to buy 
Food and Taste Aversion – classica lly condit ioned avoidance of a certain food or taste 
•	 US = bacteria 
•	 CS = whatever food the bacteria was in 
•  UR / CR = nausea , vomiting, other symptoms of food poisoning 
Food aversion is born when you avoid eating wha tever food elicited the UR / CR.
Garcia et al . – discovered mechanism behind taste aversion when studying the effects of radiation on 
rats 
•	 Rats exposed to high doses of radiation so they became sick. Rats drank less water from the
plastic water bottle in the radiation chamber than  from the glass water bott le in their “home”
cage. Why?? 
o	 US = radiation 
o	 CS = taste of water from the plastic bottle 
o	 UR / CR = getting sick 
•	 Rats a lso avo ided novel-tasting water even if the nausea didn’t occur until several hours after 
they drank. 
o  The US doesn’t need to come immediately after the CS! 
Classica l conditioning is often adaptive  the more readily an anima l can learn associations, the  more 
likely that animal is to survive . 
Conditioning the Immune System 
Robert Ader et al. –  saccharin-flavored water was paired with inject ions of cyclophosphamide (drug 
given to organ transplant donors to suppress the immune system ; side effect = nausea) 
•	 Rats began to die! 
•	 The taste of the sweetened water was not only triggering nausea, but it was also suppressing
the rats’ immune systems, which eventua lly caused them to die. Each time the rats drank the 
sweetened water, their immune systems were weakened, even without the immune-
suppressing drug. 
o	 CS = saccharin-sweetened water… act ing as a sort of placebo! 
Showed that a type of placebo response can be classically conditioned in animals 
Showed that the animal doesn’t have to be lieve that the placebo has medicinal properties in
order to have a placebo response

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 4 – Learning: How the Experience Changes Us 
OPERANT CONDITIONING – the process by which a  stimulus and response become  associated 
with the consequences of making the response 
The Roots of Operant Conditioning: Its Discovery and How It Works
If a behavior is followed by a positive consequence, an anima l is more like ly to repeat that behavior in 
the future. If a behavior is followed by a negative consequence, an animal is less likely to repeat that 
behavior . 
Operant conditioning – AKA instrumenta l condit ioning 
•	 Voluntary, nonreflexive behavior is required (instrumental) to produce the effect 
•	 Key component of S-R Psychology: consequences of making a response strengthen the
connection between the stimulus and the response that led to the pleasant consequences. 
Thorndike’s Puzzle Box 
Thorndike – studied behavior by creat ing a puzzle box, a cage with a latched door that a cat could
open by pressing down a pedal inside the cage . Food was placed outside the cage door . Once
the cat learns to press down the pedal to open the door , it is quicker to do so in subsequent 
sessions. 
It had learned that pressing the pedal opened the door and enabled it to get food 
•	
•	 Called this type of learning “trial-and-error” learning 
Law of Effect – actions that subsequently lead to a “satisfying state of affa irs”  are more likely to  be 
repeated 
The Skinner Box 
Mice get food when a lever is pressed  pressing lever is associated with the like lihood of gett ing 
food. 
•  Mice will press the lever (and eat) more frequently, learning that pressing the lever will be
followed by the appearance of a food pellet .
Outside the box is a cumulative recorder , a device that records each lever press and the time interva l 
between presses. 
Principles of Operant Conditioning
A stimulus leads to a particular response , and the associat ion between stimulus and response is
forged by the consequence of the response 
•	 Reinforcement – consequences of a  response lead to an increase in the like lihood that the 
response will occur again when the st imulus is present 
•	 Response Cont ingency – circumstance  in which a consequence depends on the animal’s
producing the desired response 
•	 Responses in operant conditioning are voluntarily produced 
•	 Reinforcer – object or  event that, when it follows a response, increases the likelihood that the
anima l w ill make that response again when the stimulus is present 
o	 What const itutes a re inforcer depends on the recipient 
Involves cognitive processing  simply telling people about  the  contingency between a
behavior and its consequence can lead to behavior change 
Reinforcement: Increasing Responses
Posit ive Reinforcement – a desired reinforcer is presented a fter a response , thereby increasing the 
likelihood of a recurrence of that response in the future (ex: getting a treat)
Negative Reinforcement – an unpleasant  object or  event  is removed after  a response, thereby
increasing the likelihood of that response in the future (ex: people drink to reduce their 
anxiety because it reduces the aversive state of anxiousness)

9.00 EXAM 1 NOTES 
KOSSLYN CHAPTER 4 – Learning: How the Experience Changes Us 
Both posit ive and negative reinforcement are re inforcing because they increase the like lihood that a
behavior will be repeated. 
Punishment – an unpleasant object  or event is presented after a response , which decreases the 
likelihood of that response in the future 
•	 Has the opposite effect of reinforcement!
Posit ive Punishment – response  leads to an undesired consequence , thereby decreasing the  likelihood
of that response in the future (ex: a failing grade for not spending a lot of effort writing a term 
paper)
Negative Punishment  (aka punishment  by removal) – a  response  leads a  pleasant  object  or event to be 
removed, thereby decreasing the likelihood of that response in the future 
Punishment is most likely to  lead to  learning (i.e .: decrease the like lihood of that response  in the
future) when it has 3 characteristics: 
1.	 Swift –  occur  immediately after  the  undesired behavior 
2.	 Consistent –  undesired behavior  must  be  punished each and every time it occurs 
3.	 Aversive 
Caution: 
1.	 Although punishment may decrease the frequency of a response , it doesn’t eliminate the
capacity to engage in that behavior . 
2.	 Physical punishement (ex: spanking) may actua lly increase aggressive behavior by the person
on the receiving end because the person may “ learn” that physical aggression is an acceptable 
behavior . 
3.	 Through classical conditioning, one being punished may come to fear the one do ing the
punishing. 
Because of the disadvantages of punishment, many training programs for parents emphasize positive 
reinforcement for good behavior . 
Primary and Secondary Reinforcers
Primary reinforcer – event / object that is inherently re inforcing (ex: food, relief from  pain)
Secondary reinforcer –  event  / object  that  is not  inherently reinforcing, but instead has acquired its
reinforcing value through learning (ex: attention, praise , good grades ) 
Behavior modification –  technique  in which behavior is changed through the  use of secondary 
reinforcers 
Immediate Versus Delayed Reinforcement
Immediate reinforcement – given immediately after the  desired response is exhibited 
Delayed reinforcement – given some period of t ime after the desired response is exhibited 
Beyond Basic Reinforcement 
Generalization and Discrimination in Operant Conditioning 
Generalization –  the  ability to transfer a  learned stimulus-response association to a new stimulus tha t
is similar to the original one , making the same response to it that led to re inforcement
previously 
•  Ex: child blowing nose into a tissue; generalizes the learned behavior to wipe on similar
stimuli with a soft surface (sleeve, etc.)
Discriminat ion – ability to  respond only to a  particular  stimulus and not  a similar one 
•	 Depends on the ability to distinguish among different stimuli or among different situations 
(contexts) in which a given stimulus may occur

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 4 – Learning: How the Experience Changes Us 
•	 Discriminat ive st imulus – cue that signals to  the  anima l whether a specific response w ill lead
to the expected re inforcement 
Extinction and Spontaneous Recovery in Operant Conditioning: Gone Today , Back Tomorrow 
Extinction –  in operant  conditioning, the  fading out of a response  following an initia l burst of that
behavior after re inforcement ceases 
Spontaneous recovery – in operant conditioning, the process by which an extinguished, previously
reinforced response reappears if there is a period of time after extinct ion 
Building Complicated Behaviors: Shaping Up
Shaping –  the  gradual process of re inforcing an organism  for  responses that get closer  to the desired 
response 
Successive approximations – series of relative ly simple responses involved in shaping a

complex response

Reinforcement Schedules: An Hourly or a Piece Work Wage?
Continuous Reinforcement – re inforcement  given for each desired response 
Partial Re inforcement  –  reinforcement given only  intermittently after desired responses
Acquiring a response is slower with part ial reinforcement than with continuous re inforcement. When
shaping new behaviors, it is best to use continuous reinforcement until the desired  behavior  is  stable.  
Different reinforcement schedules affect how easily responses are acquired and ext inguished: 
Interval Schedules –  partial reinforcement  schedule based on time 
•	
Fixed Rat io Schedules – partial reinforcement schedule based on a specified number of

•	
responses

Fixed Interval Schedule – re inforcement given for  responses only when they are produced after  a 
fixed interval of time 
•	 Ex: one treat for rat after every 10 minutes of work, regardless of how many times the lever is
pressed; bi-weekly paycheck 
Variable Interva l Schedule – re inforcement  given for a  response produced after  a variable  interva l of 
time 
•	 Ex: treat for rat after 8 minutes, then 19 minutes, then 13 minutes, etc. 
Fixed Ratio Schedule –  reinforcement given for  responses produced after a fixed number of prior 
responses 
•	 Ex: after 10th lever  press, rat  gets treat; people paid for how  much work they complete; 
•	 Efficiency and accuracy often decline  in this schedule, but  it usually produces a higher rate of
responding than does a fixed interval schedule . 
Variable Ratio Schedule – reinforcement given after variable  ratio of responses 
•	 Ex: slot machines 
•	 Most resistant to ext inction; most prone to addiction because you don’t know exact ly when
you will be reinforced, you keep responding. 
•	 Animals on this schedule tend to respond frequently, consistent ly, and w ithout long pauses. 
The Operant Brain
Operant Conditioning: The Role of Dopamine
In animals, when a particular stimulus arises, the anima ls plan their response  in advance, with the
expectat ion that the response w ill have certain consequences (ex: producing reinforcement).
Operant conditioning occurs only after the animal comes to expect certain (positive) consequences if it
makes a particular response to a st imulus. The process of building up the associations between
stimulus, response, and the expected consequences depends crucially on dopamine-releasing neurons. 
 Dopamine Reward System

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 4 – Learning: How the Experience Changes Us 
COGNITIVE AND SOCIAL LEARNING 
Cognitive Learning – the acquisition of information that may not be acted on immediate ly but is 
stored for later use 
Information is used to plan / eva luate / other forms of thinking, without producing any overt
•	
behavior 
•	 Ex: learning how to add numbers; learning the names of the 50 states 
Tolman & Honzik –  cognitive  learning is more than simple associations between stimuli and responses 
•	 Experiment: rats in maze that led to food box; rats in maze w ith no reinforcement 
o	 Rats that were rewarded with food quickly increased the ir sped in the maze and
decreased the number of mistakes 
o	 The speed and accuracy of the unrewarded second group did not improve very much 
if at a ll. 
o	 Rats in the no reinforcement group that began to receive a food reward on the 11th day 
improved performance drastically (faster, fewer errors)
Latent  learning – learning that occurs without  behaviora l indicators 
o	 Unre inforced rats stored information about the maze’s spat ial layout, but they didn’t use this
map until they were mot ivated to do so by reinforcement 
o	 Emphasizes distinction between learning something and acting on that know ledge 
Insight Learning: Seeing the Connection
Insight learning –  learning that  occurs when a person or anima l suddenly grasps how  to solve a
problem or how to interpret a pattern of information and incorporates that new knowledge
into o ld knowledge 
•  The “Ah-Ha!” phenomenon – sudden flash of awareness that learning has occurred 
Wolfgang Kohler – chimpanzee named Sultan, most famous insight learning studies 
Observational Learning: To See Is To Know
Observational learning –  learning that occurs through watching others, not through re inforcement 
Albert Bandura –  deve loped social learning theory –  emphasizes the fact that much learning occurs in a 
social content 
Observational learning depends on modeling –  process in which other  people  function as mode ls, 
presenting a behavior to be imitated
Bobo doll experiment – children who had observed the adult behaving aggressive ly with Bobo were
themse lves more aggressive . 
Learning from Models
Advantages: avoid going through all the steps (and mistakes) that learning usually requires, can go 
directly to end product
Disadvantages: can produce undesired, maladaptive learning 
You may learn how to behave by observing others, but whether you’ll actually perform a behavior
repeatedly depends, in part , on the consequences that occur when you first try out the behavior . 
Characteristics of models that make learning through observation more effective : attention; expertise;
good looking; high-status; socially powerful.
