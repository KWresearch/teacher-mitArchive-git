***** Course Description *****
This course will address operations strategy by building on the concepts of:
   1. Reengineering and process design developed by Dr. Michael Hammer.
   2. Manufacturing strategy as developed in the literature, primarily by
      people at HBS.
   3. Supply chain design and 3-D concurrent engineering literature as
      developed in Charles Fineâs book, Clockspeed: Winning Industry Control
      in the Age of Temporary Advantage. Perseus Books, 1999.
The concepts there emphasize the necessity of integrating product strategy,
manufacturing strategy, and supply chain strategy.Â As a result, each of these
will be touched upon in the course.
