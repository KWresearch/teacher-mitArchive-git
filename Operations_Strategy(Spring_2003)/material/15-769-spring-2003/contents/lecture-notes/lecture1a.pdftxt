Skinner on Manufacturing Strategy
(1969) 
• different companies within the same industry have 
different strengths and weaknesses and choose to 
compete in different ways 

• different production "systems" have different operating 
characteristics and each involves a different set of trade-
offs 

• a production system must have a customized design 
that reflects the priorities and trade-offs inherent in the 
firm’s own competitive situation and strategy 

Skinner on Manufacturing Strategy

Therefore, no one operating system is universally 
superior under all competitive situations and for all 
companies. 

Every operating system embodies a set of trade-offs. 


Some will be particularly good at producing 
standardized products in high volume at low cost; 

others will excel at responding quickly to shifting 
demand for more customized products. 

New, Competing Theory:  Lean 
1980’s:  Japanese companies were succeeding not because they 
carefully made the right set of trade-offs among different 
priorities in their operations, but because they were capable of 
surpassing their Western counterparts across several 
dimensions at once. 
Lean production achieves lower cost, higher quality, faster 
product introductions, and greater flexibility-all at the same 
time-
Lean production can dominate any competitive situation. 
Lean production combines the advantages of craft and mass 
production, while avoiding the high cost of the former and the 
rigidity of the latter:  requires less inventory, yields fewer 
defects, and produces an ever-growing variety of products. 

New, Competing Theory:  Lean 
People should be broadly trained, rather than specialized. 
Staff is "overhead" and, with a high degree of work force 
"empowerment," not necessary. 
No amount of rejects or variance should be accepted (zero 
defects is the goal). 
Communication should take place informally and horizontally, 
among line workers rather than through hierarchies. 
Equipment should be general purpose and flexible. Production 
should be organized into "cells," rather than specialized by 
process stages. 
Continuous processes, with as little work-in-process inventory 
as possible, is preferable to batch processes. 
Inventory, like rejects, is waste. 

New, Competing Theory:  Lean 
Throughput time is more important than labor or equipment 
utilization rates. 

Product development should be organized through cross-
functional teams, which pursue activities in parallel rather than 
sequentially. 

Implication: 
Manufacturing Strategy should devote less effort to customizing 
a production system and more effort trying to adopt the 
principles of the already-proven Lean Production System. 

What is Strategy
Michael Porter, HBR, 1996 
1.  Operational Excellence is NOT a Strategy 
a.  Establish a position you can preserve 
b. OE:  doing same activities better 
2.  Strategy Rests on Unique Activities 
a. Offer a different value proposition 
3.  A Sustainable Strategy requires Trade-offs 
4.  You gotta have “Fit” 
a.  System Elements: 
Consistent, Reinforcing, Optimized 

Consequences of Lean Thinking 
Western companies embarked on a wide range of programs 
(TQM, JIT, DFM, CE, empowerment, re-engineering) 
Many of these programs worked quite well and helped companies 
regain parity on costs and quality. 
However, simply adopting a set of generic improvement 
programs is not enough. (Only about one third of all the 
operations improvement programs that U.S. companies have 
undertaken were successful.) 
Further, programs that did achieve operational objectives (e.g.,

lower costs), often did not contribute to overall competitiveness.

E.g., programs may reduce costs but diminish customer service, 
responsiveness, or flexibility. 

Consequences of Lean Thinking 
So, TQM, JIT, and other dimensions of "lean production" can 
re-shape operating performance, 
But, companies still need coherent approaches that 
• utilize these tools effectively and, 
• develop enterprise strategies 
Further,  a static fit between operating strategy and competitive 
strategy (Skinner's focus) is not enough. 
Competitive environments are more turbulent. 
Technological changes are more rapid. 
Competitors (from around the globe) are more able. 

Therefore, operating strategies cannot be static. They must 
provide the capabilities that both support and drive rapidly 
evolving challenges and strategies. 

Skinner:  Reasons for  

Inconsistent Manufacturing Structures

1. 	 Manufacturing has a new manufacturing task but 
continues the old manufacturing policies and 
structure. 
2. 	Managers in manufacturing have  no clear, 
consistent definition or understanding of the 
manufacturing task facing the organization. 
3. 	The manufacturing policies and the infrastructure
being employed are inconsistent.  Taken together,
there is a distortion in coordination. 
4.  	The organization lacks a focus .  It is attempting to 
cover too many technologies or too many products
and markets, too wide a range volume, and more 
than one manufacturing task. 
D. Rosenfield, MIT 

Skinner:  Reasons for Inconsistent  

Manufacturing Structures (cont.)

5. 	The organization has the  wrong equipment &
process technology for the present
manufacturing task. 
6. 	 Selection of products and processes for each
plant in a multi-plant setup results in mixing
together, somewhat at random, a product
organization, a process organization, and a
volume-focused organization (or any two of
the three) instead of focusing around one type
of organization.

DECISIONS FREQUENTLY COME TO LIMIT THE
CORPORATION’S STRATEGIC OPTIONS, BINDING 
IT WITH FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT, PERSONNEL, 
AND BASIC CONTROLS AND POLICIES TO A 
NONCOMPETITIVE POSTURE WHICH MAY TAKE 
YEARS TO TURN AROUND.

THE TIMELESS SECRETS 

OF INDUSTRIAL SUCCESS

(R. H. HAYES, HARVARD UNIVERSITY)


1. BEWARE OF COMPLACENCY 
2. CONTINUALLY ENLIST THE HELP OF 
EMPLOYEES TO IMPROVE PRODUCT 
AND PROCESS 
3. DENY EVERY INCH TO ACTUAL 
AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS 
4. STUDY COMPETITORS' SOURCES  OF SUCCESS 
5. DON'T BE TOO RATIONAL

Facilities and Capacity

Capacity Issues: 
- Does Capacity lead or follow Demand; Use of suppliers 
- Capacity Decisions have long lead times and involve 
large increments 

Facility Issues: 
- Pure Space Needs 
- Geographic & Distribution Issues 
- Focus Issues 

- Corporate principles 
- Scale Issues 
- Means of Evaluation 

Manufacturing Technology


Manufacturing Process Technology is a fundamental 
determinant of how a company competes 
- Processes have specific attributes that are 
appropriate for different products and life cycles 
- Any new process or technology will have a major 
effect on a business 
- Do you want off-the-shelf or custom equipment? 
- Do you want to  lead or lag in manuf technology? 
- Do you want to develop manuf. tech internally?
