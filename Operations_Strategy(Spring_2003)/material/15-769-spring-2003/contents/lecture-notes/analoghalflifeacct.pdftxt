Measuring Operations Performance

at Analog Devices

(Language of Money vs.

Language of Physical Operations) 

Senior managers speak the
Middle managers must
“Language of Money”
be bilingual translators 
EPS, ROI, NPV, etc. 

Factory staff speak the
“Language of Things”
Flow rates, defects, 
downtime, etc. 

Alternatives to middle management translation:
1.  Teach language of money to the factory (Texas Eastman)
2.  Teach language of things to executives (Analog Devices)
3.  Teach both (Goldratt)

Under a Traditional (Direct-Labor-Based) Cost Allocation 

System in Plant B, Fuschia Pens Will Only Differ in Cost

From Blue Pens by the Differences in Material Costs

Analog Devices

(1. Describe of the half-life system and its rationale.)


1. Measures improvement progress in some metric 
(e.g., defects, cycle time, accidents, time-to-market) 
2. Tracks length of time to 50% improvement 
(= “half-life”) 
3. Focuses measurement on dynamics of improvement 

Analog Devices

(2.Strengths and weaknesses of the half-life system)

Strengths

Weaknesses 
1.Quantitative Improvement 

1. Assumes constant learning 
Measurement System

rates 
2.System to measure 
2. No guidance on process 
progress in any metric 
3. Logarithms not intuitive 
3.Consonant with continuous 
4. No packaged programs 
improvement themes & 
5. No benchmarks 
PDCA 
6. Not process oriented 
4. Enables comparisons 
across organizations on 
rates of improvement. 
5. Focuses on results 
6.  Understandable, data-driven 

Analog Devices

(3. Examples from the case that illustrate conflicts

between operational and financial measures)

1. As wafer yields improved, fewer wafer starts were 
increasing cost/wafer. 
2. End-of-Quarter revenue needs lead to focusing on large 
(rather than late) orders, so OTD suffers. 
3. Expediting engineering lots in the factory can 
degrade factory production performance. 
4. Overall yield improvement can mask degradation on some 
categories 
5. When operations are efficient, the are tradeoffs across 
Service, Inventory, and Cost. 
6. Exhibits 10 & 11 versus 12 & 13 

Analog Devices

(Describe of the scorecard system and its 

rationale)

1. Part of an executive information system that 
captures multiple domains of metrics. 
2. Recognizes the need for balanceacross metrics 
for 
a. Financial Reports 
b. Customer Satisfaction 
c. Internal Business Processes 
d. Innovation, Learning, and Growth 
3. Explicitly addresses existence of category 
tradeoffs 

Analog Devices

(5. Strengths & weaknesses of the scorecard 

system )


Strengths 
Weaknesses 
1.Recognizes need for balance  1. Doesn’t tell how to make 
across metric domains 
tradeoffs 
•	 Recognizes the existence of  •  No simple objectives
tradeoffs 
3.Recognizes that no single 
metric captures it all 
4. Can provide cross-functional 
basis for discussions
