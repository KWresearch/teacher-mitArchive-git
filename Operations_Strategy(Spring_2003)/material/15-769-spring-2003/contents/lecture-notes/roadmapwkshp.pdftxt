Cisco’s Strategy for  

Technology Supply Chain Design 
1. Integrate technology around the router to 

be a communications network provider. 

2. Leverage acquired technology with
- sales muscle and reach 
- end-to-end IT 
- outsourced manufacturing 
- market growth
3. Leverage venture capital to supply R&D

Basic Design Principle:  Acquisition

Study," E. Anderson,  C. Fine & G. Parker  Production and Operations 
Management, Vol. 9, No. 3, Fall 2000, pp. 239-261. 

LESSONS FROM A FRUIT FLY:

CISCO SYSTEMS


1. KNOW YOUR LOCATION 
IN THE VALUE CHAIN 
2. UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS 
OF VALUE CHAIN FLUCTUATIONS 
3. THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT THE ROLE 
OF VERTICAL COLLABORATIVE 
RELATIONSHIPS 
4. INFORMATION AND LOGISTICS SPEED
DO NOT REPEAL BUSINESS CYCLES OR 
THE BULLWHIP.

The Strategic Leverage of Value Chain Design:

Who let Intel Inside? 

1980:  IBM designs a product, a process, & a value chain 

Customers 

IBM 
Intel Inside 

The Outcome: 
A phenomenonally successful product design 
A disastrous value chain design (for IBM) 

Intel 

Microsoft 

LESSONS FROM A FRUIT FLY:

THE PERSONAL COMPUTER 

1.  	 BEWARE OF INTEL INSIDE 
(Regardless of your industry) 
2.  MAKE/BUY IS NOT ABOUT WHETHER IT IS 
TWO CENTS CHEAPER TO OUTSOURCE 
3. 	 VALUE CHAIN DESIGN CAN DETERMINE 
THE FATE OF COMPANIES AND INDUSTRIES, 
AND OF PROFIT AND POWER 
4. 	 THE LOCUS OF VALUE CHAIN CONTROL 
CAN SHIFT IN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS

ARCHITECTURES IN 3-D

INTEGRALITY VS. MODULARITY


Integral product architectures feature 

close coupling among the elements
- Elements perform many functions

- Elements are in close spacial proximity

- Elements are tightly synchronized

- Ex:  jet engine, airplane wing, microprocessor

Modular product architectures feature 

separation among the elements
- Elements are interchangeable 

- Elements are individually upgradeable

- Element interfaces are standardized

- System failures can be localized

- Ex:  stereo system,  desktop PC, bicycle


VALUE CHAIN ARCHITECTURE


Integral value-chain architecture 
features close proximity among its elements 
- Proximity metrics:  	Geographic, Organizational 

Cultural, Electronic 

- Example:  Toyota city  

- Example:  Ma Bell (AT&T in New Jersey)

- Example:  IBM mainframes & Hudson River Valley  

Modular value-chain architecture features multiple, 
interchangeable supplier and standard interfaces 
- Example:  Garment industry 
- Example:  PC industry 
- Example:  General Motors’ global sourcing 
- Example:  Telephones and telephone service

Qualitative analysis of strategic  

importance uses five key criteria


 

Value chain elements with high customer 
importance and fast clockspeed are generally 
strategic (unless there are many capable 
suppliers) 

Competitive position is seldom the 
primary consideration for strategic 
importance, rather it serves as a 
“tie-breaker” when other criteria are 
in conflict 

Customer 
Importance: 
•  High 
• 
Medium 
•  Low 

Technology 
Clockspeed: 
Fast 
• 
Medium 
• 
• Slow 

 

When many capable 
suppliers exist, knowledge 
may be considered 
commodity and 
development should be 
outsourced 



• Advantage

• Parity

  Architecture is considered a 
constraint for the sourcing decision 
model, controls the level of 
engineering that must be kept in 
house for integration purposes 
Model developed by GM Powertrain, PRTM, & Clockspeed, Inc. 
Criteria are applied differently for Products than for Subsystems

• Outsource 
Partner/Acquire 
• 
• Partial Insource 
• Partial Outsource 
• Invest 
• Spin Off

OPTICAL VALUE CHAIN:

MINI CASE EXAMPLE


NORTEL NETWORKS plays at at least three levels of 
the Optical Network Telecom value chain: 
1. Network design & installation 
2. Modules (OC-192 network elements) 
3. Components (lasers, amplifiers) 
QUIZ:  Should Nortel sell their components business?

Hint:  How likely are the scenarios of: 
- An  Intel Insideeffect in components? 
- Networks become sufficiently modular as to be 
assembled by the customer?

”Killer Technologies” of the Information Age: 

Semiconductors, Magnetic Memory, Optoelectronics


“We define a ‘killer technology’ as one that 
delivers enhanced systems performance of a
factor of at least a hundred-fold per decade.” 
C.H.Fine & L.K. Kimerling, "Biography of a Killer Technology:  

Optoelectronics Drives Industrial Growth with the Speed of Light,”

published in 1997 by the Optoelectronics Industry Develoment

Association, 2010 Mass Ave, NW, Suite 200, Wash. DC 20036-1023. 

Killer Question: 

Will Integrated Opticsevolve linearly like 
Semiconductors with Moore’s Law or like 
Disk Drives with repeated industry disruptions?

Digital Signal

Fiber & 
Wire-

Network 

WSB architectures are 
-integral & proprietary
Suppliers include: Nortel,

Disruptive Modem advances
(e.g., MUD) can double 
Base Station Capacity 

Modular WSB’s might
(1) Stimulate new WSB entrants (ala Dell)
(2) Stimulate standard subsystem suppliers
(3) lower prices to the network operators
(4) Speed base station performance imp.
(5) Increase demand for basestations due 
to improved price-performance ratios.

All Conclusions are Temporary


Clockspeeds are increasing almost everywhere 

Telecoms exhibits fast clockspeed & high volatility 

Telecom Technology is a clockspeed driver 

Value chain design is a key competency
