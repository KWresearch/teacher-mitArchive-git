Midlevel Vision  
 
Study Questions  
1. What is population coding, and why is it needed to interpret local visual signals? 
Explain how it is necessary to understand how motion, disparity, depth, and orientation 
are represented. 
2. What is convolution? Give an example of how convolution can both increase the 
fidelity of some visual information, while discarding information about other visual 
properties. 
3. Why can't vision be understood as simply a process of filtering? Why does the visual 
system have to go beyond local measurements of the image to construct representations 
of surfaces and objects? Give examples of how, why, and when the visual system goes 
beyond the image data to construct surface and object representations.
