Attention 
 
Study Questions  
1. How "early" in processing does attention select information? 
2. What kinds of information does attention select? 
3. What are mechanisms underlying attention (baseline shift, gain modulation, other)? 
4. Consider attention in light of Marr's levels of analysis: Is a meaningful and substantive 
understanding of attention possible at the cognitive/algorithm level alone, or will any 
such analysis be hopelessly vague and incomplete until a neural implementation of 
attentional phenomena is specified?
