Cognitive Neuroscience of Memory 

Study Questions: 

1. Characterize the multi-component model of working memory forwarded by Baddeley 
& Hitch. Specify the lines of evidence that support a distinction between phonological 
rehearsal and phonological storage processes. 

2. Describe the distinction between "blocking" and "suppression" mechanisms of 
forgetting, illustrating each with relevant data. 

3. Characterize the distinction between declarative and non-declarative forms of long-
term memory, providing behavioral evidence from studies of healthy adults and 
neuroanatomical evidence from studies of patient populations for this distinction.
