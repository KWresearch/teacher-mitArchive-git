1 : the urban-rural threshold

The  proposal  for  the  site  is  to  create  an  exchange  between  the 
rural  workers  and  urban  inhabitants  by  creating  a  new  village 
centered  on  new  forms  of  high  density  agricultural  production. 
Sustainable  farming  of  food,  energy,  clean  water  and  air  is 
proposed  along  the  greenbelt  creating  a  productive  space  that 
bleeds  into  the site.  New  forms of  farming and education provide 
a venue  for migrant workers  to  increase  their skill set allowing  for 
urbanization and exchange.

the urban-rural threshold / social 

[1] transform urban and rural lifestyles.

The  site  acts  as  an  incubator  for  the  integration  of  urban  and  rural  lifestyles.    It  provides  a  forum  for  city  residents  (i.e., 
artists,  sociologists,  ecologists,  historians,  etc.)  and  migrant  workers  to  share  aspects  of  their  lifestyles  (economic  and 
social), creating a hybrid between rural and urban forms of living and working.

[2] sustainable infrastructure. 
The  site  is  part  of  a  larger  system  of  sustainable  infrastructure 
tied  to  the  greenbelt,  which  has  the  potential  to  be  a  productive 
space – providing areas  to  farm  food, clean water, clean air, and 
energy.  The  site  draws  on  the  greenbelt,  as  well  as  the  canal 
system,  the  wetland,  and  the  housing  typology,  to  maximize  its 
that  potential.  Agricultural  farming  will  be  integrated  into  the 
housing  typology,  providing  space  that  residents  can  use  to 
produce goods for the market.

The  station  is  an  essential  exchange  point,  drawing  and  distributing  traffic  to  and  from  the  road  and  subway  systems, 
parks, water,  historic  axis,  and  local  community.    A  market  area mediates  the  space  between  the  station  and  housing. 
The training and learning center, located above the station, provides an active mixing point with a regional reach.

[4] redefine the axis.

Formerly,  a  north-south  axis  linked  temples  within  the  site  and  aligned  with  the  Temple  of  the  Sun.    The  “excavating”  of 
this  axis  re-establishes  a  local  public  way  that  becomes  the  central  armature  for  the  local  community,  containing  local 
libraries, schools, a community center and local-scale shops.

[5]  reinterpretation  of  the  low-rise, 
high density housing typology. 
The  site’s  existing  housing  will  be  replaced  with  low-rise  and  high-rise 
housing, integrated into the grain of the existing housing and organized into 
linear  “ribbons.”  The  housing  typology  allows  for  flexibility  and  growth, 
while  providing  variability. 
Sustainable 
infrastructures,  such  as 
photovoltaics and farmland, are integrated into each unit.  Higher density  is 
achieved through the stacking of layers, producing built up areas that begin 
to resemble China’s mountainous landscape.

[6] phasing and renewal. 
a. phasing of people entering and leaving the site: 
The  bulk  of  the  people  entering  the  site  will  migrate  legally  from  rural  areas.  This  site  offers  an 
alternative  route  for  the  urbanization  of  rural  families.  After  a  process  of  “urbanizing”  which 
consists  of  business  education,  light  manufacturing  and  selling  of  goods,  the  economic 
activities of the city become available to the now legalized migrant worker. 
b. phasing of the land – fallow land vs. cultivated land 
The  land  will  be  phased  to  allow  for  continuous  production  throughout  the  year.    Shared  plots  will 
allow  for  fallow plots  to  regenerate without  the use of  inorganic  fertilizers.   Furthermore, high-
tech  farming  and  greenhouses  will  be  used  to  allow  for  agricultural  production  during  the 
winter. 
c. phasing of construction 
1 : Train station (incl. market, training center, and restaurants), wetlands, forest, windmills, and  
temporary housing for displaced residents.  Create all “green” connections. 
2 : High-density western edge housing and start of north-south axis, including public programs. 
3 : Farming housing: begin at the north-south axis and work towards the station.  Build the transport 
dock on southern edge of north-south axis. 
4 : After urbanization is complete and migration ceases, the entire site could be converted to an 
education system – i.e.,  studying ecology, farm camp, high-tech farming center. 

d. phasing of the seasons 
The  site  functions  as  an  intensive  farm  during  the 
summer,  with  light  manufacturing  and  education  during 
the  winter. 
to 
is  designed 
  The  “market”  space 
accommodate  several  programs  throughout  the  year 
with encompassing production, selling, leisure.

2 : site context


The site between the Sun Palace transport station, the greenbelt 
and  the  Bahe  River  serves  as  threshold  between  urban  and 
rural  life.  The  old  rice  paddy  proportions,  creating  a  plan  of 
ribbons  cut  transversely  by  irrigation  canals,  determined  the 
physical  form  of  the  village.    Today,  this  form  is  still  evident  in 
the  housing  dimensions  and  the  irrigation  canals  now  serve  as 
primary streets.

The  physical  form  of  the  project  begins  by  striating  the  site  with 
ribbons taken from the rice paddy dimensions.  These small-scale 
ribbons  connect  into  the  regional  framework  of  the  greenbelt  and 
twist to merge into the new city grid of ring roads and megablocks.

The  ribbon  framework  is  cut  transversely  by  elevated  irrigation 
canals  that organize a series of vertical streets and plazas  into a 
public  structure  of major  and minor  axes.    Existing  buildings  are 
given new public functions and fit into this hierarchical framework.

4 : housing typology


The  housing  typology  integrates  rooftop  farming,  greenhouse 
(high-tech)  farming,  photovoltaic  (energy)  farming  and  living 
quarters  around  traditional  courts. 
Three  unique  housing 
typologies  are  proposed  to  fit  into  these  ribbons  and  create  a 
series of conditions through valleys and hills – reminiscent of the 
terraced farms in rural China.

5 : axis


The  excavation  of 
the  historic  north-south  axis  and 
the 
repurposing  of  several  existing  buildings  along  it  re-establishes 
a  public  way  that  becomes  the  central  armature  for  the  local 
community,  containing  a  library,  school,  health  care  facilities, 
shops  and  restaurants.  A  series  of  fountains  emphasize  the 
aesthetic  and  productive  value  of  water  along  the  main  axis, 
distributed  from  a  high-rise water  tower  at  the  top  of  the  axis  to 
the rooftop farms via the aqueduct.

6 : transport station


The  station  is  an  essential  civic-scale  exchange  point,  drawing  and 
distributing  traffic  to  and  from  the  road  and  subway  systems,  parks, 
water,  historic  axis,  and  local  community.  A market  area  linked  to  light 
industry  mediates  the  space  between  the  station  and  housing.    The 
educational  center  and  greenhouse  located  above  the  station  create  a 
regional marker and densify activity at  the  transport hub.  The  roads are 
lifted  to allow  the  fabric and key  layers of  the project  to  flow  through  the 
station.  This  allows  light  and  activity  to  occur  in  close  proximity  to  the 
train platforms, embedding the station into the community.
