Access to the Inside 
Kyuree Kim, Albert Wei, Bao Wei, Cindy Wu, Feng Yu 

We strive to create a new model 
of development, a modern 
dan-wei that provides shelter and 
employment across the spectrum 
of socio-economic classes in 
Beijing.  For those at the lower 
end of a hierarchical society, we 
seek to provide access to the 
“inside.”  This access is spatial, 
realized in a logistics corridor that 
brings everyday goods to the 
Third Ring Road for distribution 
to the inner city.  
This access is 
also social and economic - along 
the logistics corridor are live-work 
communities that provide job 
training linked to job opportuni(cid:173)
ties, basic health care, primary 
and adult education, and public 
spaces to its residents.  The Sun 
Palace site is one such example. 
It houses 5,500 residents in 
2,100 units of housing, with the 
opportunity for all 2,400 current 
residents to have the option of 
remaining on the site.

This diagram demonstrates the urbanized and yet-to-be urbanized 
lands in Beijing.  The Sun Palace site is located at the edge of the 
urbanized fabric.  Our proposal seeks to create a new model for 
urbanization that considers the changing economic and social make (cid:173)
up of Beijing.

As an alternative, we propose a series of mixed-use, 
located in satellite cities outside of the city.  
These 
live-work wedges that connect the rural periphery to urban Beijing at the Third Ring Road.  
wedges include affordable housing and job training for migrant people, economic development pro(cid:173)

The governance and economic 
structure of the residential and 
commercial aspects of the site 
are where the principles of the 
site are realized.  The quasi-
governmental Land Trust will 
own all of the land on the site. 
They will sell the development 
rights to individual private devel(cid:173)
opers in who, in return, must 
dedicate a percentage of their 
profits to the Trust and also sell 
a portion of the housing back to 
the Trust.  The Trust will be re (cid:173)
sponsible for preserving afford (cid:173)
able housing and small busi(cid:173)
ness opportunities on the site.

Ms. Zhang is a working professional, an 
architect.  She is a Beijing native and 
was lured to the Sun Palace Community 
because of its walkable nature.  She 
lives in the same building as Ms. Wang 
On a typical day, 
and they are friends. 
Ms. Zhang will go to work at her office in 
“the wall” and then have a lunch meeting 
with clients in one of the restaurants on 
the lower floors.  After work, she likes to 
take leisurely walks through the site’s 
many public spaces.

Mr. Li
 migrated to Beijing from rural 
China when farming was no longer a 
viable occupation.  He was able to re(cid:173)
ceive job training in packaging and 
light machine operation and currently 
works at the factory in the northwest 
corner of the Sun Palace Community.  
His job is only a short walk from the 
dormitory housing in which he lives 
and the health clinic where he gets 
regular check-ups.  Once a week, in 
the evening, Mr. Li participates in lit (cid:173)
eracy training at the adult education 
center.

Ms. Wang
moved to the Sun Palace Community from Hebei with her 
young daughter.  
She has a love for food and currently works in flag(cid:173)
ship, organic restaurant on the site.  Her shift begins after she drops 
her daughter off at the elementary school every morning.  
Most days, 
she shops by the marketplace after work to buy fresh produce to cook 
dinner for her family.  They live in one of the affordable units on the site 
but Ms. Wang hopes to save enough money to move into one of the 
shop houses and open her own restaurant.
