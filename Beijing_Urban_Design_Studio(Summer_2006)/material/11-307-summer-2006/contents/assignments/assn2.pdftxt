Exercise #2 ~ June 22, 2006 
"Strategic Directions" 
 
Our second task is to explore different approaches to the future of the Sun Palace neighborhood.  
In this exercise your team will solidify its attitude about what the area should become and prepare 
a program and design proposal which illustrates this direction.  The proposal will be developed in 
two steps: 
 
A.  Design Concept 
 
In the first part of this assignment, you should quickly discuss and debate different approaches to 
the future of the area and agree on a preferred direction for your team.  You should consider the 
neighborhood (as outlined) and its surroundings: canal, new subway and roads, industrial sites, 
cleared sites, and the edges of nearby high rise developments as part of the project area.  
 
In deciding on your direction, you may want to consider:  What changes will the subway bring to 
land values, activities, and the physical form of this area of Beijing?  What could be the future 
role of the Sun Palace neighborhood?  Will it be an island amidst high rise buildings or part of a 
larger humanely scaled fabric?  Who will live there?  How can this modest neighborhood and the 
new subway coexist?  Can they? 
   
This part of the assignment is due on Monday, June 26 at 2:00.  Each team will share a 10 
minute overview of its conclusions, including:   
 
1.  A one page written summary of the principles you feel should guide development in this 
area. (no more than 5-7) 
2.  A preliminary program of activities 
3.  A diagram of your planning concept for the area showing:  paths, land uses, and 
texture of buildings and spaces. 
4.  Identify 1-2 key nodes or sections that are key to your approach for further development 
(one must relate to the subway).   

 
B. Illustrative Sketch Plan  
 
In this part of the assignment you should develop your concept by illustrating design intentions 
for the entire area, placing greater emphasis on the 1-2 key areas defined above.   
 
You should consider each of the concerns investigated in the first assignment: Circulation 
patterns; the transit station; housing and living areas; commercial, office and work locations; the 
public realm of facilities and places, the story of the site and its people. How does your scheme 
address the issues identified for each of these topics?      
 
This part of the assignment is due on Friday, June 30  at 9:00 AM.  Each team should present 
a concise 15 minute overview of their Illustrative Plan.  You should prepare:

1.  A one page written description of your approach. How does it illustrate your 
principles?   
2.  An overall illustrative plan for the area, showing features of your proposal.  (1:1000 
scale)   
3.  Program and sketch design for one key sub-area(s).  Sections,models or axonometric to 
depict massing.  
4.  Other drawings or analogous photos as needed to convey your ideas.   

 
As you decide upon a direction and prepare an Illustrative Plan for the area, there are several key 
issues that have emerged from our discussions to date that you may want to bear in mind: 
 

  
End of assignment 
 
 

(cid:131)  How can the Sun Palace neighborhood play an important role in the future life of the 
city? 

 
(cid:131)  What is the best relationship between the Sun Palace neighborhood and the transit stop? 
  
(cid:131)  What is the appropriate balance of local housing verses “regional” facilities and 
commerce in a transportation node of this kind? 

 
(cid:131)  How can your proposal act as a model for design and development in the vicinity of 
transit stops?  
 
(cid:131)  How can we create high quality public spaces and an identifiable place in the city?
