Final Assignment ~ July 7, 2006 
“Presentation-Putting it all Together” 
 
 
This it the last assignment and an opportunity to put into final form your ideas and 
designs to communicate to a larger audience.  
All work on the project will be finished by next Friday, July 14, when there will be a 
final presentation and review at 10:00 am.  All people who have been involved in the 
studio will be invited, including faculty and students, officials of the Beijing Planning 
Institute, and hopefully press and TV. 
The presentation should be in power point from four panels of final drawings. (the 4th 
panel may not be used in the magazine).These panels will be in A1 vertical size that can 
be used both for the power point presentation as well as be reduced to A4 for a magazine 
article. This then is the final product of the studio. 
 
 
The work should include at least the following but can be added to in order to clearly 
present the idea of your work. 
 
Products 
1.  Statement of the idea of your design/name of group/individual names. 
2.  Images from site to support your concept (chose two or three that relate to your 
design). 
3.  Concept diagrams of larger area in relationship to your design such as uses, 
transportation or open space. 
4.  Overall Illustrate Site Plan to clearly illustrate idea and act as a key drawing for 
other sketches, sections, diagrams and other material.  This drawing should be on 
one board and should be a large as possible (use vertical dimension) 
5.  Land use plan, Circulation plan, Public space framework plan (these 3 plans are 
derived from the Illustrative Plan and colored to indicate topics. 
6.  Sections through site at key locations. 
7.  Digital model/physical model, sketches, axons, photo montages to show in three 
dimensions the overall concept. 
8.  Detail plans, sections, digital models of your special  section area.  This is equal 
in importance to the Illustrative plan. 
9.  Any other material you believe is needed to clearly illustrate your design. 

 
The four panels along with models will be exhibited in the lobby of the building. Each 
team will have 10 minutes to present their design with a power point presentation. After 
the presentations there will be time to discuss your proposal with individual guests. 
The exhibition panels should be able to be reduced to A4 size (for the magazine and still 
be legible). All illustrations should be titled and captioned to explain the drawing. See

examples from last year. The major text should be in Chinese without English translation 
(this could be added later for English speakers). 
All panels should use a basic 3 column vertical division of space (see examples).  
It is important that all work be completely finished so that on Friday the workshop is 
completely done, the work ready to be published. 
Good luck!
