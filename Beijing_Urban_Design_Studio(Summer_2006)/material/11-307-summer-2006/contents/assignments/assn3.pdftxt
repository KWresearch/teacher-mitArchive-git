Exercise #3 ~ July 4, 2004 
"Section of Form" 
 
Each team now has an overall plan/design for the area. It will be adjusted with new 
information from last Friday’s review as well as future work and your new thoughts. 
This exercise is to develop a section of the plan in as much architectural detail as possible 
in order to illustrative how to design will connect to the different uses and conditions 
across the site. The section would start at the transit stop and continue to the high rise 
housing off the site. The six sections can act as examples for not only our site but 
other similar conditions. 
Part 1 
Chose a section/slice through the area that you think is important to explore in more 
detail. The section need not be large in width but represent an idea of the section. 
After selecting a section explore in more detail the following: 
1.  Architectural form of the section 
2.  Uses/program of area 
3.  Relationship to transit stop 
4.  Relationship to different uses and physical conditions. 
5.  Texture of buildings and space 
6.  Circulation of all types 
Work at the following scales: 
1.  Plan at 1:500 (as many as needed to explain idea) 
2.  Sections at 1:200  
3.  Details as needed 
4.  Physical model  
5.  Sketches, computer model…… 
Part 2 
A revised sketch plan at 1:1000 to suggest changes (this can be a rough sketch over the 
last plan) 
1.  Detailed uses 
2.  Number of housing units. 

 
A presentation of the form, idea and design of you section/form. 
 
Due on Saturday at 9:30 AM for discussion. This is the last discussion before next week 
which will be for presentation of the team’s work.
