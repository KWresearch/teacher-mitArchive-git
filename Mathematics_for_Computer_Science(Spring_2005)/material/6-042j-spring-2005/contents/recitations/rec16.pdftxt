Problem  3.  [20  points]  A  previous  problem  set  introduced  us  to  the  Catalan  numbers: 
C0 , C1 , C2 , . . . , where  the n­th of  them equals  the number of balanced strings  that can be 
built with 2n paretheses. Here is a list of the ﬁrst several of them:

√
Then,  in  lecture we were  all  amazed  to  see  that  the  decimal  expansion  of  the  irrational 
number 500000   − 1000
249999 
1.000001000002000005000014000042000132000429001430004862016796058786208012  . . . 

“encodes”  these  numbers!  Now,  there  are many  reasons why  one may want  to  turn  to 
religion, but this revelation is probably not a good one. Let’s explain why. 

(a)	 Let pn  be  the number of balanced  strings  containing n (’s.  Explain why  the  fol­
lowing recurrence holds: 
� 
p0  = 1,	
n
pk−1  · pn−k , 
k=1 

(the empty string) 
for n ≥ 1. 

pn  = 

Solution.  Note  that every nonempty balanced  string consists of a sequence of one 
or more balanced strings. The ﬁrst balanced string in the sequence must begin with 
a (  and  end with  a  “matching” ).  That  is,  any  balanced  string,  rn , with  n  ≥  1  (’s 
consists  of  a  balanced  string,  sk−1 ,  enclosed  in  brackets  and  containing  k − 1  (’s, 
followed by a balanced string, tn−k , with n − k (’s: 
rn  =  (sk−1) followed by tn−k 
where 1  ≤ k ≤ n. This observation leads directly to the recurrence. 
(b)  Now consider the generating function for the number of balanced strings: 
P (x) =  p0  +  p1x +  p2x 2  +  p3x  +  · · ·  .

Prove that 

P (x) =  xP (x)2  +  1. 

Solution. We can verify this equation using the recurrence relation. 

xP (x)2  +  1  =  x(p0  +  p1x +  p2x 2  +  p3x 3  +  · · · )2  +  1 
0  +  (p0p1  +  p1p0 )x +  (p0p2  +  p1p1  +  p2p0 )x  2  +  · · · ) +  1 
=  x(p  2 
0x +  (p0p1  +  p1p0 )x  2  +  (p0p2  +  p1p1  +  p2p0 )x  3  +  · · · 
=  1  +  p 2 
=  1  +  p1x +  p2x 2  +  p3x 3  +  · · · 
=  P (x)

(c)	 Find a closed­form expression for the generating function P (x). 
Solution.  Given that P (x) =  xP  (x)2  +  1, the quadratic formula implies that 
1  ± √
1  − 4x

P (x) =

If x  is small, then P (x) should be about p0  = 1.  Therefore, the correct choice of sign 
is 

P (x)  =

(d)  Show that P (1/1000000)  =  500000  − 1000

P (1/1000000)  = 

249999. 

(e)	 Explain why the digits of this irrational number encode these successive numbers 
of balanced strings. 
Solution.  Suppose that we symbolically carry out the substitution done in the pre­
ceding problem part. 

P (x)  =  p0  +  p1x  +  p2x 2  +  p3x  +  · · · 
3
P (10−6 )  =  p0  +  p110−6  +  p210−12  +  p310−18  +  · · · 

Thus,  p0  appears  in  the units position,  p1  appears  in  the millionths position,  p2  ap­
pears in the trillionths position, and so forth.

Problem 4.  Consider the following recurrence equation: 
1	
n =  0 
Tn  = 2	
n =  1 
(n ≥ 2) 
2Tn−1  + 3Tn−2 
Let f (x) be a generating function for the sequence �T0 , T1 , T2 , T3 , . . .�. 

6 

(a)  Give a generating function in terms of f (x) for the sequence: 
�1
2T3  + 3T2 , . . .�
, 

2T2  + 3T1 , 

2,  

2T1  + 3T0 , 

Solution.  We can break this down into a linear combination of three sequences: 
� 
�	
=  1 + 2x 
� 
�	
=  xf (x) 
� 
�  =  x2f (x) 

1,  
0, 
0, 
0, 
2, 
0, T0 , T1 , T2 , T3 , 
0,  
0, T0 , T1 , T2 , 

. . . 
. . . 
. . . 

In particular,  the sequence we want  is very nearly generated by 1 + 2x + 2xf (x) + 
3x2f (x). However, the second term is not quite correct; we’re generating 2 + 2T0  =  4 
instead of  the  correct value, which  is 2.  We  correct  this by  subtracting 2x from  the 
generating function, which leaves: 

1 + 2xf (x) + 3x 2f (x) 

(b)	 Form an equation  in f (x) and solve to obtain a closed­form generating function 
for f (x). 
Solution. The equation 

f (x) =  1 + 2xf (x) + 3x 2f (x) 

equates the left sides of all the equations deﬁning the sequence T0 , T1 , T2 , . . . with all 
the right sides.  Solving for f (x) gives the closed­form generating function: 

f (x) = 

1 
1 − 2x − 3 2x

(c)	 Expand the closed form for f (x) using partial fractions.

Solution.  We can write: 


1 − 2x − 3 2 x  =  (1 + x)(1 − 3x)


Thus, there exist constants A and B such that:


f (x) =	

1 
1 − 2x − 3x2 

=

1 − 3x

Now substituting x =  0 and x =  1 gives the system of equations:

Solving the system, we ﬁnd that A =  1/4 and B =  3/4. Therefore, we have:
