A  proposition  is  a  statement  that  is  either  true  or  false.  Propositions  can  be  joined  by 
“and”, “or ”, “not”, “implies”, or “if and only if ”. For each of these connective, the deﬁni­
tion and notational shorthand are given in the table below. Here A and B denote arbitrary 
propositions.

A predicate is a proposition whose truth depends on the value of one or more variables. 
If P is a predicate, then 
∀x ∈ S P (x) 
means that the predicate is true for every value of x in the set S .  Similarly, 
∃x ∈ S P (x) 

means that the predicate is true for at least one value of x in the set S .

Team Problem: A Mystery 

2 

A certain cabal within the 6.042 course staff is plotting to make the ﬁnal exam ridiculously 
hard.  (“Problem 1.  Derive all of known mathematics  from ﬁrst principles.  Express your 
answer  in  Mayan  hieroglypics.”)  The  only  way  to  stop  their  evil  plan  is  to  determine 
exactly who is in the cabal. The course staff consists of seven people: 
{Eric , Srini , Christos , Grant , Ishan , Sally, Theory Pig } 

(Sallyis the course secretary and Theory Pig is our mascot.)  The cabal is a subset of these 
seven.  A membership  roster  has  been  found  and  appears  below,  but  it  is  deviously  en­
crypted  in  logic  notation.  The  predicate C  indicates who  is  in  the  cabal;  that  is,  C (x)  is 
true if and only if x is a member. Translate each statement below into English and deduce 
who is in the cabal. 

(i)  ∃x ∃y ∃z (x =  y ∧ x =  z ∧ y =  z ∧ C (x) ∧ C (y) ∧ C (z ))  
Solution.  A direct English paraphrase would be “There exist people we’ll call x, y , 
and  z ,  who  are  all  different,  such  that  x, y  and  z  are  each  in  the  cabal.”  A  better 
version  would  use  the  fact  that  there’s  no  need  in  this  case  to  give  names  to  the 
people.  Namely,  a  better paraphrase  is  “There  are  3 different people  in  the  cabal.” 
Perhaps a simpler way to say this is:  “The cabal is of size at least 3.” 
(ii)  ¬(C (Theory Pig ) ∧ C (Grant )) 
Solution.  Theory Pig and Grant are not both in the cabal.  Equivalently:  at least one 
of Theory Pig and Grant is not in the cabal. 
(iii)  C (Sally) → ∀x C (x) 
Solution.  If Sallyis in the cabal, then everyone is. 
(iv)  C (Grant ) → C (Theory Pig ) 
Solution.  If Grant is in the cabal, then Theory Pig is also. 
(v)  (C (Ishan ) ∨ C (Christos ))  → ¬C (Srini ) 
Solution.  If either of Ishan or Christos is in the cabal, then Srini is not. Equivalently, 
if Srini is in the cabal, the neither Christos nor Ishan is. 
(vi)  (C (Ishan ) ∨ C (Theory Pig ))  → ¬C (Eric ) 
Solution.  If  either  of  Ishan or  Theory Pig is  in  the  cabal,  then  Eric is  not.  Equiva­
lently, if Eric is in the cabal, the neither Ishan nor Theory Pig is. 

So much for the translations. We now argue that the only cabal satisfying all six propo­
sitions above is one whose members are exactly Theory Pig , Ishan , and Christos .

We ﬁrst observe that by (ii), there must be someone – either Theory Pig or Grant – who 
is not  in  the  cabal.  But  if Flo were  in  the  cabal,  then by  (iii),  everyone would be.  So we 
conclude by contradiction that: 

Sallyis not in the cabal. 

(1) 

Next  observe  that  if  Grant was  in  the  cabal,  then  by  (iv),  Theory Pig would  be  too, 
contradicting (ii).  So by again contradiction, we conclude: 

Grant is not in the cabal. 

(2) 

Now  suppose  Srini is  in  the  cabal.  Then  by  (v),  Ishan and  Christos are  not,  and  we 
already  know  Sallyand  Grant are  not,  so  only  three  remain  who  could  be  in  the  cabal, 
namely, Srini , Theory Pig , and Eric .  But by  (i)  the cabal must have at  least  three mem­
bers, so it follows that the cabal must consist of exactly these three. This proves: 

Lemma 1.  If Srini is in the cabal, then Theory Pig and Eric are in the cabal. 

But by (vi), if Theory Pig is the cabal, then Eric is not. That is, 

Lemma 2.  Theory Pig and Eric cannot both be in the cabal. 

Now from Lemma 2 we conclude  that the conclusion of Lemma 1  is false.  So by con­
trapositive, the hypothesis of Lemma 1 must also be false, namely, 

Srini is not in the cabal. 

(3) 

Finally,  suppose  Eric is  in  the  cabal.  Then  by  (vi),  Ishan and  Theory Pig are  not,  and 
we already know Sally, Grant and Srini are not.  So the cabel must consist of at most two 
people (Christos and Eric ). This contradicts (i), and we conclude by contradiction that 

Eric is not in the cabal. 

(4) 

So the only remaining people who could be in the cabal are Christos , Ishan , and Theory Pig . 
Since the cabal must have at least three members, we conclude that 

Lemma 3.  The only possible cabal consists of Christos , Ishan , and Theory Pig . 

But we’re not done yet:  we haven’t shown that a cabal consisting of Christos ,  Ishan , 
and Theory Pig actually does satisfy all six conditions. So let A =  {Christos ,   Ishan ,  Theory Pig }, 
and let’s quickly check that A satisﬁes (i)–(vi): 

•  |A = 3, so A  satisﬁes (i).
| 
•  Grant is not in A, so A  satisﬁes (ii) and (iv).

•	 Sallyis not in A, so the hypothesis of (iii) is false, which means that A  satisﬁes (iii). 

•	 Finally,  Srini and Eric are not  in A,  so  the  conclusions of both  (v)  and  (vi)  are  true, 
and so A  satisﬁes (v) and  (vi). 

So now we have proved 
Proposition.  {Christos ,   Ishan ,  Theory Pig } is the unique cabal satisfying conditions (i)–(vi).

Team Problem: Swapping Quantiﬁers

Suppose  P  is  predicate  that  depends  on  two  variables  that  take  on  values  in  the  set  S . 
Here are two propositions: 
(∀x ∈ S ∃y ∈ S P (x, y))   ⇒ (∃y ∈ S ∀x ∈ S P (x, y))  
(∃y ∈ S ∀x ∈ S P (x, y))   ⇒ (∀x ∈ S ∃y ∈ S P (x, y))  

(1) 
(2) 

(a)	 Give  an  example  of  a  predicate  P  and  set  S  that makes  one  of  these  propositions 
false.  (The set S can be anything you choose:  colors, animals, food, people, etc.). 
Solution.  Let S be  the set of all people who have ever  lived, and  let P (x, y)  be  the 
proposition that “the mother of person x is person y”. 
Then  the  left side of  the ﬁrst proposition  is  true;  every person has a mother.  How­
ever, the right side is not true; there is not a single person who is everyone’s mother. 
Thus, the ﬁrst proposition as a whole is false. 

(b)	 Explain why the other proposition is always true. 
Solution. The left side of the second proposition asserts that there exists a y— call it 
y0— such that P (x, y) is true regardless of the value of x.  This implies that the right 
side of the proposition is also true; for every x there exists a y (namely, y0 ) such that 
P (x, y) is true.
