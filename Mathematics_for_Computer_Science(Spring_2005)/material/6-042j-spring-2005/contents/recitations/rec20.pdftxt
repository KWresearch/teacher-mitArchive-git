Problem  1.  The  following  two  parts  are  not  related.  Try  them,  to  make  sure  you  un­
derstand the jargon of random variables, distributions, probability density functions, etc. 
Ask your TA if you don’t understand/remember what some phrase means. 

(a)	 Suppose X1 , X2 , and X3  are three mutually independent random variables, each 
having the uniform distribution 

Pr  (Xi  =  k)  equal to 1/3  for each of k  = 1,  2,  3. 

Let M  be another random variable giving the maximum of these three random vari­
ables. What is the density function of M ? 
Solution.  This can be easily hashed out by counting the possible outcomes: 

M 

is  1  with probability 

2  with probability 

3  with probability

(b)	 Suppose X , Y  are two independent binomial random variables with parameters 
(n,  p) and (m,  p), respectively. What is Pr   (X  +  Y  =  k)? 
Solution.  The pdf of X  is the probability of tossing k  Heads out of n  independent 
ﬂips  of  a  coin  with  bias  p.  Likewise  for  Y  and  m  ﬂips.  Since,  X  and  Y  are  inde­
pendent,  the pdf of X  +  Y  corresponds to n  +  m  independent ﬂips,  i.e., X  +  Y  is a

Binomial variable with parameters (n  +  m,  p). Hence,

Problem 2.  I’m God.  Seriously.  So, I know everything that everybody thinks.  In particu­
lar, I know who each one of the 250,000,000 Americans want to vote for in the upcoming 
elections.  I know that a fraction p  = 0.52  of them want to vote for the current president. 
You  are  mortal.  An  insigniﬁcant  dot  in  space­time.  But  a  quite  signiﬁcant  dot  among 
dots. You work close to the president and, within a week, you must answer his agonizing 
question:  “Am I winning?” Or, in math jargon (but with the same agony):  “Is p
 >
 1 
2 ?”

Your ﬁrst idea is to ask me (I’m God). But you haven’t talked to me for a long time, so you 
know  I won’t  tell you.  Your second  idea  is  to call every American, ask  them,  then divide 
the yes’s by 250 million.  But you soon realize there  is not enough time (there is a reason 
for  representative democracy).  Your  third  idea. . .  You have no  third  idea!  In your panic 
as the week is almost over, you start picking Americans at random, call them, and ask! 
Amazingly, that’s the correct approach.  But you should be careful what you are going to 
say to the president! Let’s see. 

(a)	 In  you  ﬁrst  phone  call,  you  pick  1  American  uniformly  at  random,  call,  and  ask 
whether he/she will vote for the president. What is the probability that the answer 
is  going  to  be  “yes”. . .  (i)  from my  perspective?  (ii)  from  your  perspective?  How 
would you model this in terms of coin ﬂips? 
Solution.  From my perspective, it’s 0.52.  From your perspective, it is also 0.52.  The 
only  problem  is  that  you  don’t  know  that,  so  you  just  call  it  p.  Clearly,  from  your 
perspective, the ﬁrst phone call is the same as ﬂipping a coin with an unknown bias, 
which you call p  (and I know is 0.52). 

(b)	 In your  second phone  call,  you again pick 1 American uniformly  at  random,  call, 
and  ask whether he/she will vote  for  the president.  But wait!  When  selecting  the 
second voter, shouldn’t you exclude the guy that you asked in the ﬁrst phone call? 
No. What’s bad if you exclude him/her? 
Solution.  If  you  do  this,  you  alter  the  coin  that  you  are  ﬂipping.  The  bias  will 
decrease or increase, depending on whether the ﬁrst guy said “yes” or “no”, respec­
tively. The analysis gets messy, so you don’t want to do this. 

(c)	 So,  in  each  one  of  n  phone  calls,  you  pick  1  American  uniformly  at  random  and 
ask.  Your  plan  is  to  eventually  divide  the  number M  of  positive  answers  by  n  to 
get  P  =
 n 
M  .
 An MIT  friend  tells  you  that,  as  the  numerical  outcome  of  a  random

experiment, this P  is a random variable; and that, according to his calculations, 
Pr  ( P  − p ≤ 0.03)  
|
| 
≥ 

0.95. 

(1)

When  you  are done  calling people,  you divide  to  get P ,  and  it’s  0.53.  You  call  the 
president up and. . .  what do you say? 

•  Mr. President, p  = 0.53! 
•  Mr. President, with probability at least 95%, p  is within 0.03 of 0.53!

•	 Mr.  President,  either  p  is  within  0.03  of  0.53  or  something  very  strange  (less 
than 5­in­100) has happened. 

For each statement answer:  (i) Are you justiﬁed to claim it?  (ii) Is it true? 
Solution.  The ﬁrst statement is clearly off the mark. 

(i)  Since you haven’t asked all Americans, you can only make probabilistic state­
ments about p. 
(ii)  The statement is also false, since p  = 0.52.  However, with a different choice of 
voters,  it could have been  true.  Of course,  even  in  that  case,  you wouldn’t be 
justiﬁed to claim it. 

The second statement is also wrong. 

(i)  The  unknown  constant  p  is  either within  0.03  of  0.53  or more  than  0.03  away  of 
0.53.  In the ﬁrst case, the probability of it being as you claim is 1; in the second 
case,  it  is  0.  The  crucial  point  is  that  you  don’t  know which  case  holds.  You 
could make the above claim, only if you knew you were in the ﬁrst case.  Sadly, 
you don’t. 
(ii)  The  claim  is  actually  true  in  this  case.	 Since  p  = 0.52,  the  unknown  constant 
is  indeed within  0.03  of  0.53.  So  the  probability  that  you  talk  about  is  1,  and 
therefore  at  least  95%.  But,  as  we  said,  it  could  be  0  and  then  the  statement 
would be false. 

The third statement is the correct one. 

(i)  You are justiﬁed to claim this statement. To see why, start with the statement 
0.53  − p ≤ 0.03 
|
|	
0.53  − p >  0.03.
|
| 

either 

or 

which is clearly true. Now read it as follows:  Either p  is within 0.03 of 0.53 or it 
is not and therefore my random random variable P  took a value from a set that 
is hit only 5 times in 100.  So, clearly either p  is within 0.03 of 0.53 or something 
strange has happened. 
(ii)  The statement is true.  In the particular case, it is true because the ﬁrst half of it 
is true.

Fact  from  lecture.  Suppose  a  coin  that  comes  up  heads  with  probability  p  is  ﬂipped  n 
times. Then for all α  <  p

Problem  3.  A  coin  that  comes  up  heads  with  probability  p  is  ﬂipped  n  times.  Find  an 
upper bound on 
Pr  (# heads ≥ βn) 
where β >  p. Think about the number of tails and plug into the monster formula above. 

Solution. 

Pr  (# heads ≥ βn)  = Pr   (# tails ≤ (1  − β )n)  
Now  tails  comes  up with  probability  1  − p.  So  the  answer  is  the  same  as  above with  α 
replaced by 1  − β  and p replaced by 1  − p:

Problem 4.  A Gallup poll in November 2004 found that 35% of the adult population of the 
United States believes  that  the  theory of  evolution  is  “well­supported by  the  evidence”. 
Gallup polled 1016 people and claims a margin of error of 3 percentage points. 
Let’s  check Gallup’s  claim.  Suppose  that  there are m  adult Americans,  of whom pm  be­
lieve evolution is well­supported and (1  − p)m  do not. Gallup polls n  Americans selected 
uniformly  and  independently  at  random.  Of  these,  qn  believe  that  evolution  is  well­
supported and (1  − q)n  do not. Gallup then estimates that the fraction of Americans who 
believe evolution is well­supported is q . 
Note that the only randomization in this experiment is in who Gallup chooses to poll.  So 
the  sample  space  is all  sequences of n  adult Americans.  The  response of  the  i­th person 
polled  is  “yes”  with  probability  p  and  “no”  with  probability  1  −  p  since  the  person  is 
selected uniformly at random.  Furthermore, the n  responses are mutually independent. 

(a)	 Give  an  upper  bound  on  the  probability  that  the  poll’s  estimate  will  be  0.03  or 
more too low.  Just write the expression; don’t evaluate yet! 
Solution.  We can regard each response as a coin ﬂip that is heads with probability 
p.  In these terms, qn  is the total number of heads ﬂipped.  So we have: 
Pr  (qn  ≤ (p − 0.03)n)

· � 
1  − (p − 0.03)	
2nH (p−0.03)

≤ 
1  − (p − 0.03)/p  
2π(p − 0.03)(1  − (p − 0.03))n 
(b)	 Give  an  upper  bound  on  the  probability  that  the  poll’s  estimate will  be  0.03  or 
more too high. Again, just write the expression. 
Solution. Reasoning as before and using the answer to the preceding problem gives: 
· � 
2nH (p+0.03)

2π(p +  0.03)(1  − (p +  0.03))n  

Pr  (qn  >  (p +  0.03)n)

≤ 
p +  0.03 
1  − 
1−(p+0.03) 
1−p 

· p(p+0.03)n (1  − p)(1−(p+0.03))n 

· p

(p−0.03)n (1  − p)(1−(p−0.03))n 

(c)	 The sum of  these  two answers  is  the probability  that Gallup’s poll will be off by 
3  percentage  points  or  more,  one  way  or  the  other.  Unfortunately,  these  expres­
sions both depend on p—  the unknown  fraction of evolution­believers  that Gallup 
is trying to estimate! 
However, the sum of these two expressions is maximized when p  = 0.5. So evaluate 
the  sum with  p  = 0.5   and  n  = 1016  to  upper  bound  the  probability  that  Gallup’s 
error  is 0.03 or more.  Pollsters usually try to ensure that there  is a 95% chance that 
the  actual  percentage  p  lies within  the  poll’s  error  range,  which  is  q  ± 0.03  in  this 
case.  Is Gallup’s evolution poll properly designed? 
Solution.  The probability  that  the error  is 0.03 or more  is about 0.07, which means 
that p will lie within the error range of a polled fraction with probability 0.93. So our 

Recitation 20

estimates  suggest Gallup’s  poll  is  not  quite  large  enough  to meet  the  claimed  0.95 
probability.  Since Gallup is a professional, we expect he’s got the poll size right, by 
by using a more accurate numerical estimation formula – or he may have considered 
it legitimate to round a very slightly larger margin of error down to 0.03. 

(d)	 If we  accept  all  of Gallup’s  polling  data  and  calculations,  can we  conclude  that 
there  is a high probability  that  the number of adult Americans who believe evolu­
tion is well­supported by the facts is 35  ± 3  percent? 
Solution.  No.  This  is  an question of  fact, which  is  either  true or  false.  We  can  say 
that  either  the  statement  above  is  true  or  else  a  1­in­20  event  occurred  during  the 
poll; speciﬁcally, Gallup chose an unrepresentative sample.  This may convince you 
that  p  is  “probably”  in  the  range  0.35  ±  0.03,  but  there  is  no  way  to  convert  that 
informal “probably” to a mathematical probability.
