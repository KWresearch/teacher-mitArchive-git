The Four­Step Method 

This  is  a  good  approach  to  questions  of  the  form,  “What  is  the  probability  that ——­?” 
Intuition will mislead you, but this formal approach gives the right answer every time. 

1.  Find the sample space.  (Use a tree diagram.) 

2.  Deﬁne events of interest.  (Mark leaves corresponding to these events.) 

3.  Determine outcome probabilities: 

(a)  Assign edge probabilities. 
(b)  Compute outcome probabilities.  (Multiply along root­to­leaf paths.) 

4.  Compute event probabilities.  (Sum the probabilities of all outcomes in the event.)

A Baseball Series 

2 

Problem 1.  The New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox are playing a two­out­of­three 
series.  (In other words,  they play until one  team has won  two games.  Then  that  team  is 
declared the overall winner and the series ends.) Assume that the Red Sox win each game 
with probability 3/5, regardless of the outcomes of previous games. 
Answer  the  questions  below  using  the  four­step method.  You  can  use  the  same  tree 
diagram for all three problems. 

(a)  What is the probability that a total of 3 games are played? 

(b)  What is the probability that the winner of the series loses the ﬁrst game? 

(c)  What is the probability that the correct team wins the series? 

Solution.  A tree diagram is worked out below. 

From the tree diagram, we get: 

Pr  (3 games played) =

Pr  (winner lost ﬁrst game) =

Pr  (correct team wins) =

The Four­Door Deal 

3 

Problem  2.  Suppose  that  Let’s Make  a  Deal  is  played  according  to  different  rules.  Now 
there are four doors, with a prize hidden behind one of them.  The contestant  is allowed 
to pick a door. The host must then reveal a different door that has no prize behind it. The 
contestant is allowed to stay with his or her original door or to pick one of the other two 
that are still closed.  If the contestant chooses the door concealing the prize in this second 
stage, then he or she wins. 

(a)  Contestant  Stu,  a  sanitation  engineer  from  Trenton,  New  Jersey,  stays  with  his 
original door. What is the probability that he wins the prize? 
The tree diagram is awkwardly large.  This often happens; in fact, sometimes you’ll 
encounter  inﬁnite  tree  diagrams!  Try  to  draw  enough  of  the  diagram  so  that  you 
understand the structure of the remainder. 
Solution. Let’s make the same assumptions as in the original problem: 

1.  The prize is equally likely to be behind each door. 
2.  The  contestant  is  equally  likely  to  pick  each  door  initially,  regardless  of  the 
prize’s location. 
3.  The  host  is  equally  likely  to  reveal  each  door  that  does  not  conceal  the  prize 
and was not selected by the player. 

A partial tree diagram is shown below. The remaining subtrees are symmetric to the 
full­expanded subtree.

We multiply by 4 to account for the four subtrees of which we’ve only drawn one. 

(b)	 Contestant Zelda, an alien abduction researcher from Helena, Montana, switches 
to  one  of  the  remaining  two  doors with  equal  probability.  What  is  the  probability 
that she wins the prize?

Mergatroid the Engineering student 

5 

Problem  3.  Let’s  consider  another  variation  of  the  four­doors  problem.  Suppose  that 
Carol  always  opens  the  lowest­numbered  door  possible  with  the  restriction  that  she  can 
neither reveal the prize nor open the door that the player picked. 
This  gives  contestant  Mergatroid—  an  engineering  student  from  Cambridge,  MA— 
just  a  little  more  information  about  the  location  of  the  prize.  Suppose  that  Mergatroid 
always switches to the lowest­numbered door, excluding his initial pick and the one Carol 
opened. What is the probability that he wins the prize? 
(Interestingly,  in  the  three­door  problem,  the  contestant  gains  no  advantage  if  Carol 
always opens the lowest­numbered door available.) 

Solution.  A tree diagram is worked out below. 

The probability that Mergatroid wins is:
