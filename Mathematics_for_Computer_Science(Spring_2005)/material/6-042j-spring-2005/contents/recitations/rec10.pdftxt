Problem 2.  You’ve seen this neat trick for evaluating a geometric sum: 

S  = 1 + z + z 2  + . . . + z 
n
zS  = z + z 2  + . . . + z  + z 
n+1

S − zS  = 1 − z n+1 
1 − z n+1 
1 − z 

S  = 

Use the same approach to ﬁnd a closed­form expression for this sum: 

T  = 1z + 2z 2  + 3z  + . . . + nz n

Solution. 

zT  = 1z 2  + 2z 3  + 3z  + . . . + nz

T  − zT  = z + z 2  + z  + . . . + z n  − nz n+1

Remarkably,  an  expression  similar  to  this one  comes up  in  analyzing  the distribution of 
birthdays. Let’s make sense of it. 

(a)	 Give a two­term Taylor approximation for ex .  (Forget about the error term.) 
Solution. 

x e  ≈ 1 + x 

(b)  This  is  probably  the  most  wide­used  approximation  in  computer  science.  The 
fact that x appears at “ground level” in the approximation and in the exponent of e
x
lets us translate sums into products and vice­versa.  Rewrite the product using this 
approximation. 
Solution.

(c)	 Now use a standard summation formula to simplify the exponent. 

Solution.  The formula 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + n = n(n + 1)/2 gives: 


n(n+1)/(2n2 )
e 

1/2+1/2n 
= e 

(d)	 What constant does this approach for large n?

√
Solution.

Problem  4.  Let’s  use  Taylor ’s  Theorem  to  ﬁnd  some  approximations  for  the  function 
1 + x.

f �� (x) = −

Now we plug into Taylor ’s theorem:

(b)  Sketch  the  function 
1 + x and your approximation.  How good  is  the approxi­
mation when x = 8? 
Solution.  The approximation  is pretty bad when x  = 8.  The actual value  is 3,  but 
x � 
the approximation is ­3.

(c)  Using  this  approximation  and  the  fact  that 
1 + 1/x,  give  an  ap­

1 + x that is accurate for large x
