1  Conditional Expectation and Total Expectation 

There  are  conditional  expectations,  just  as  there  are  conditional  probabilities.  If  R  is  a 
random variable and E is an event, then the conditional expectation Ex (R | E ) is deﬁned 
� 
by: 
Ex (R | E ) = 
R(w) · Pr (w  | E ) 
w∈S 
For  example,  let R be  the  number  that  comes up  on  a  roll  of  a  fair die,  and  let E  be  the 
event that the number is even.  Let’s compute Ex (R | E ), the expected value of a die roll, 
� 
given that the result is even. 
Ex (R | E ) = 
w∈{1,...,6} 
=  1 · 0 + 2 ·  + 3 · 0 + 4 ·  + 5 · 0 + 6 ·

It helps to note that the conditional expectation, Ex (R | E ) is simply the expectation of 
R with respect to the probability measure PrE  () deﬁned in PSet 10.  So it’s linear: 
Ex (R1  + R2  | E ) =  Ex (R1  E ) + Ex (R2  E ) .

Conditional  expectation  is  really  useful  for  breaking  down  the  calculation  of  an  ex­
pectation  into  cases.  The  breakdown  is  justiﬁed  by  an  analogue  to  the Total Probability 
Theorem: 
Theorem 1  (Total Expectation).  Let E1 , . . . , En  be  events  that partition  the  sample  space  and 
all have nonzero probabilities.  If R is a random variable, then: 
Ex (R) =  Ex (R | E1 ) · Pr (E1 ) + · · · + Ex (R En ) · Pr (En )
| 
For example,  let R be the number that comes up on a fair die and E be the event that 
� 
� 
result is even, as before. Then E is the event that the result is odd. So the Total Expectation

theorem says: 
Ex (R) =  Ex (R E ) · Pr (E ) + Ex  R E 
· Pr (E )
= 4 
= 7/2  
= 1/2 
= 1/2

The only quantity here  that we don’t  already know  is Ex  R  | E 
� 
� 
, which  is  the  expected 
die roll, given that the result is odd.  Solving this equation for this unknown, we conclude 
that Ex  R  | E  = 3. 
To prove the Total Expectation Theorem, we begin with a Lemma.

Lemma.  Let  R  be  a  random  variable,  E  be  an  event  with  positive  probability,  and  IE  be  the 
indicator variable for E . Then

Problem 1.  Final exams in 6.042 are graded according to a rigorous procedure: 

7  the exam is graded by a recitation instructor, with probability  2  it7 
•	 With probability  4 
is graded by a lecturer, and with probability  1 
7 , it is accidentally dropped behind the 
radiator and arbitrarily given a score of 84. 

•	 Recitation  instructors score an exam by scoring each problem  individually and  then

taking the sum.


–	 There are  ten  true/false questions worth 2 points each.  For each,  full credit  is 
given with probability  3 
4 , and no credit is given with probability  1  .4
–	 There  are  four  questions  worth  15  points  each.  For  each,  the  score  is  deter­
mined by rolling two fair dice, summing the results, and adding 3. 
–	 The single 20 point question is awarded either 12 or 18 points with equal prob­
ability. 

•	 Lecturers score an exam by rolling a fair die twice, multiplying the results, and then

adding a “general impression” score.


–	 With probability  10   , the general impression score is 40. 

4
3

–	 With probability  10   , the general impression score is 50. 

3

–	 With probability  10   , the general impression score is 60. 

Assume all random choices during the grading process are mutually independent. 

(a)  What is the expected score on an exam graded by a recitation instructor? 
Solution.  Let X  equal the exam score and C  be the event that the exam is graded by 
a recitation instructor. We want to calculate Ex (X  | C ). By linearity of (conditional) 
expectation,  the  expected  sum  of  the  problem  scores  is  the  sum  of  the  expected 
problem scores. Therefore, we have: 
�

�
� �

Ex (X C ) =  10 · Ex (T/F score  C ) + 4 · Ex (15pt prob score | C ) + Ex (20pt prob score  C )

Problem 2.  Here’s yet another fun 6.042 game! You pick a number between 1 and 6. Then 
you roll three fair, independent dice. 

•  If your number never comes up, then you lose a dollar. 

•  If your number comes up once, then you win a dollar. 

•  If your number comes up twice, then you win two dollars. 

•  If your number comes up three times, you win four dollars! 

What is your expected payoff?  Is playing this game likely to be proﬁtable for you or not? 
Solution. Let the random variable R  be the amount of money won or lost by the player 
in a round. We can compute the expected value of R  as follows: 
� �3
� �2  � � 
�  � �  �2

game!

Problem 3.  The number of squares that a piece advances in one turn of the game Monopoly 
is determined as follows: 

•	 Roll two dice, take the sum of the numbers that come up, and advance that number 
of squares. 

•	 If you roll doubles (that is, the same number comes up on both dice), then you roll a 
second time, take the sum, and advance that number of additional squares. 

•	 If  you  roll  doubles  a  second  time,  then  you  roll  a  third  time,  take  the  sum,  and 
advance that number of additional squares. 

•	 However,  as  a  special  case,  if  you  roll  doubles  a  third  time,  then  you  go  to  jail. 
Regard this as advancing zero squares overall for the turn. 

(a)	 What  is  the  expected  sum  of  two  dice,  given  that  the  same  number  comes  up  on 
both? 
Solution.  There are six equally­probable sums:  2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.  Therefore, the 
expected sum is:

(b)	 What is the expected sum of two dice, given that different numbers come up?  (Use 
your previous answer and the Total Expectation Theorem.) 
Solution.  Let the random variables D1  and D2  be the numbers that come up on the 
two  dice.  Let  E  be  the  event  that  they  are  equal.  The  Total  Expectation  Theorem 
� 
� 
�  � 
says: 
Ex (D1  + D2 ) =  Ex (D1  + D2  | E ) · Pr (E ) + Ex  D2  + D2  E  Pr  E
· 
|	

·

· 
12 =   7 

Two dice are equal with probability Pr (E ) =  1/6, the expected sum of two indepen­
dent dice  is 7, and we  just showed that Ex (D1  + D2  | E ) =  7.  Substituting  in these 
�  5 
�
quantities and solving the equation, we ﬁnd: 
� 
� 
· 
7 =  7 ·  + Ex  D2  + D2  | E

Ex	 D2  + D2  | E  =  7 

(c)	 To simplify the analysis, suppose that we always roll the dice three times, but may 
ignore the second or third rolls if we didn’t previously get doubles. Let the random 
variable Xi  be  the  sum  of  the  dice  on  the  i­th  roll,  and  let Ei  be  the  event  that  the 
i­th roll is doubles. Write the expected number of squares a piece advances in these 
terms.
