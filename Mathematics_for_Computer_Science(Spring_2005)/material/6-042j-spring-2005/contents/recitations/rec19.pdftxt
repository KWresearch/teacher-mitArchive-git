Problem 1.  Suppose that you ﬂip three fair, mutually independent coins.  Deﬁne the fol­
lowing events: 

•  Let A be the event that the ﬁrst coin is heads. 

•  Let B  be the event that the second coin is heads. 

•  Let C  be the event that the third coin is heads. 

•  Let D be the event that an even number of  coins are heads. 

(a)	 Are these events pairwise independent?

Solution.  The sample space consists of eight, equiprobable outcomes: 

{H, T }
3  =  {HHH, HH T , H T H, H T T , T HH, T H T , T T H, T T T } 

Each sequence of three symbols speciﬁes the outcomes of the three coin tosses. 
The  ﬁrst  three  events  (A,  B ,  and  C )  are  pairwise  independent,  since  they  are mu­
tually  independent.  All  that  remains  is  to  check  that  each  of  these  is  independent 
of D . By symmetry, we need only check just one of the three, say A: 

1 
Pr  (A) = 
2 
=  Pr   ({HH T , H T H, T HH, T T T }) =  1 
Pr  (D) 
2 
Pr  (A ∩ D)  = Pr  ({HH T , H T H }) =
 4 
1 
Therefore,  Pr  (A ∩ D)  =  Pr  (A) · Pr  (D),  and  so  these  events  are  independent.  We 
conclude that all four events are pairwise independent. 

(b)  Are these events three­way independent? That is, does 
Pr  (X  ∩ Y  ∩ Z )  = Pr   (X ) · Pr  (Y ) · Pr  (Z ) 
always hold when X , Y , and Z  are distinct events drawn from the set {A, B , C, D}? 
Solution.  Because the coin tosses are mutually independent, we know: 
Pr  (A ∩ B ∩ C )  = Pr   (A) · Pr  (B ) · Pr  (C )

What  remains  is  to  check  that  equality  holds  for  the  other  subsets  of  three  events: 
{A, B , D}, {A, C, D}, and {B , C, D}.  By symmetry, again, we need only check one, 
say the ﬁrst one. 
Pr  (A ∩ B ∩ D)  = Pr   ({HH T }) =
 1 
8 
Since this is equal to Pr  (A) · Pr   (B ) · Pr  (D), these three events are independent. 
We conclude that all four events are three­way independent. 

(c)	 Are these events mutually independent? 
Solution.  No, because: 
Pr  (A ∩ B ∩ C  ∩ D)  = Pr   (A) · Pr  (B ) · Pr  (C ) · Pr  (D)

Fact from lecture.  If there are N  days in a year and m  people in a room,  then the proba­
bility that no two people in the room have the same birthday is about: 
e−m2 /(2N ) 
Problem  2.  Suppose  that  we  create  a  a  national  database  of  DNA  proﬁles.  Let’s  make 
some simplistic assumptions: 

•	 Each  person  can  be  classiﬁed  into  one  of  20 billion  different  “DNA  types”.  (For 
example,  you might  be  type  #13,646,572,661  and  the  person  next  to  you might  be 
type #2,785,466,098.) Let T (x) denote the type of person x. 

•	 Each DNA type is equally probable. 

•	 The DNA types of Americans are mutually independent. 

(a)	 A congressman argues  that  there are only about 250 million Americans, so even 
if a proﬁle  for every American were stored  in  the database,  the probability of even 
one coincidental match would be very small. How many proﬁles must the database 
actually  contain  in  order  for  the  probability  of  at  least  one  coincidental  match  be 
about 1/2? 
� 
Solution.  By the birthday principle, the probability of a match is around half when 
the number of entries is: 
· 
2 ln  2  20,  000,  000,  000  = 166,   511 
(b)	 Person x  is arrested for a crime that was committed by person y .  At trial,  jurors 
must  determine  whether  x  =  y .  The  crime  lab  says  x  and  y  have  the  same  DNA 
type.  The prosecutor argues that the probability that x  and y  are different people is 
only 1  in 20 billion.  Write  the prosecutor ’s assertion  in mathematical notation and 
explain her error. 
Solution. The prosecutor is asserting that: 
Pr  (x  and y  are different people | T (x) =  T (y))   = 2  · 
10−10
This  assertion  is  at  best  false  and  arguably  not  even  a  well­formed  mathematical 
statement.  Either x  and y  are the same person or different people, regardless of the 
DNA types of all the people in the world.  Thus, either x  and y  are the same person 
in every outcome or they are different people.  Consequently, the probability above 
is either 0 or 1, but we don’t know which. 
The prosecutor ’s argument sounds confusingly similar to a correct assertion:  if x  and 
y  are different people, then: 
· 
Pr  (T (x) =  T (y)) = 2  10−10 
The prosecutor can validly argue  that either an amazing 1­in­20 billion coincidence 
involving DNA has occurred or else x  and y  are the same person. On this basis, a jury 
might conclude that x  is almost surely guilty, but there is nothing in our probability 
model to justify that conclusion directly.

Problem 3.  Suppose there are 100 people in a room.  Assume that their birthdays are in­
dependent and uniformly distributed.  As stated in lecture notes, with probability >  99% 
there will be two that have the same birthday. 
Now  suppose  you  ﬁnd  out  the  birthdays  of  all  the  people  in  the  room  except  one—call 
her “Jane”—and ﬁnd all 99 dates to be different. 

(a)  What’s wrong with the following argument: 

With probability greater  than 99%,  some pair of people  in  the room have 
the  same  birthday.  Since  the  99  people we  asked  all  had  different  birth­
days,  it  follows  that with probability greater  than 99%  Jane has  the same 
birthday as some other person in the room. 

Solution.  Here’s the problem with the argument: Let A  be the event that some two 
people  in  the  room  have  the  same  birthday.  Let B  be  the  event  that  the  99  people 
we asked all have different birthdays. 
It is true that Pr  (A)  >  0.99   (that is indeed the probability spoken about in the lecture 
notes).  However,  that  is  the  a priori probability,  i.e.,  assuming all  the birthdays are 
uniform  and  independent,  with  no  other  constraints.  The  argument  above makes 
the erroneous assumption that event A  has probability of at least 99%  even once we 
know  that event B  holds.  But once we know  that event B  holds,  the birthdays are 
no  longer  independent.  Thus  Pr  (A  | B )  is  not  necessarily  equal  to  Pr  (A)  (in  our 
case, they are actually quite different, as will be computed in part (b)). 

(b)	 What  is  the  actual  probability  that  Jane  has  the  same  birthday  as  some  other 
person in the room? 
Solution.  Let S  be the set of birthdays of the 99 people in the room other than Jane. 
By  assumption,  |S |  = 99.  Let  b  be  the date of  Jane’s birthday.  Since  b  is uniformly 
distributed over a set of size 365, and b  is independent of all the birthdays in S , we 
have

| 
Pr  (A B ) = Pr   (b  ∈ S ) =

≈ 27.1%,

where B  is the event that the 99 people we asked all have different birthdays.

Problem 4.  There were n  Immortal Warriors born into our world, but in the end there can 
be only one. The Immortals’ original plan was to stalk the world for centuries, dueling one 
another  with  ancient  swords  in  dramatic  landscapes  until  only  one  survivor  remained. 
However,  after  a  thought­provoking  discussion  of  probabilistic  independence,  they  opt 
to give the following protocol a try: 

1.  The Immortals forge a coin that comes up heads with probability p. 

2.  Each Immortal ﬂips the coin once. 

3.  If  exactly one  Immortal ﬂips heads,  then he or  she  is declared The One.  Otherwise, 
the protocol is declared a failure, and they all go back to hacking each other up with 
swords. 

(a)	 One  of  the  Immortals  (the  Kurgan  from  the  Russian  steppe)  argues  that  as  n 
grows large, the probability that this protocol succeeds must tend to zero.  Another 
(McLeod  from  the  Scottish  highlands)  argues  that  this  need  not  be  the  case,  pro­
vided p   is chosen very carefully. What does your intuition tell you? 
Solution.  Your  intuition  tells  you  that  a  short  nap  would  be  nice  right  now.  As 
would a couple cookies to dunk in a cold glass of milk. 

(b)  What is the probability that the experiment succeeds as a function of p  and n? 
Solution.  The sample space consists of all possible results of n  coin ﬂips, which we 
can represent by the set {H,  T }n . Let E  be the event that the experiment successfully 
selects The One.  Then E  consists of the n  outcomes which contain a single head.  In 
general, the probability of an outcome with h   heads and n  − h  tails is: 

hp  (1  − p)n−h 

Summing  the  probabilities  of  the  n  outcomes  in  E  gives  the  probability  that  the 
procedure succeeds: 

Pr  (E )  =  np(1  − p)n−1 

(c)	 How should p, the bias of the coin, be chosen in order to maximize the probability 
that the experiment succeeds?  (You’re going to have to compute a derivative!) 
Solution. We compute the derivative of the success probability: 

np(1  − p)n−1  =  n(1  − p)n−1  − np(n  − 1)(1  − p)n−2 

d 
dp

Now we set the right side equal to zero to ﬁnd the best probability p: 

n(1   − p)n−1  =  np(n  − 1)(1  − p)n−2 
(1  − p)  =  p(n  − 1) 
p  = 1/n 

This answer makes  sense,  since we want  the  coin  to  come up heads exactly 1  time 
in n. 

(d)	 What is the probability of success if p  is chosen in this way? What quantity does 
this approach when n, the number of Immortal Warriors, grows large? 
Solution.  Setting  p  = 1/n   in  the  formula  for  the  probability  that  the  experiment 
succeeds gives:

In the limit, this tends to 1/e. McLeod is right.
