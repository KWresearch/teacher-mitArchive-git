Problem 1.  A couple decides to have children until they have both a boy and a girl. What 
is  the  expected  number  of  children  that  they’ll  end  up with?  Assume  that  each  child  is 
equally likely to be a boy or a girl and genders are mutually independent. 

Solution. There are many ways to solve this problem. We’ll do it from ﬁrst principles. 
Suppose  that a  couple has  children until  they have both a boy and a girl.  A  tree dia­
gram for this experiment is shown below. 

Let the random variable R be the number of children the couple has.  From the deﬁnition

of expectation, we have: �

The only difﬁculty is evaluating the sum. We can use the general formula

We have to tweak this a little to get the sum we’re interested in.  Subtracting 1 from each

A much  simpler  approach  uses  the  fact  that  the  “mean  time  to  failure”  is  1/p  where 
p is  the  probability  of  failure  in  one  step.  If we  consider  having  a  child  of  opposite  sex 
to the ﬁrst a “failure” of that child, then the mean time to failure is the expected number 
of  children  after  the  ﬁrst  until  the  couple  has  both  a  boy  and  a  girl.  But  the  probability 
of a  failure at  the k th child after  the ﬁrst  is 1/2  for all k  ≥  1.  So  the expected number of 
children after the ﬁrst is 1/(1/2) = 2, and the expected number of children including the 
ﬁrst is 1+2 =3.

Problem 2.  A classroom has sixteen desks arranged as shown below. 

If there is a girl  in front, behind,  to the  left, or to the right of a boy,  then the two of them 
ﬂirt.  One student may be  in multiple ﬂirting couples;  for example, a student  in a corner 
of  the  classroom  can  ﬂirt  with  up  to  two  others,  while  a  student  in  the  center  can  ﬂirt 
with  as  many  as  four  others.  Suppose  that  desks  are  occupied  by  boys  and  girls  with 
equal  probability  and mutually  independently.  What  is  the  expected  number  of  ﬂirting 
couples? 

Solution.  First,  let’s  count  the  number  of  pairs  of  adjacent  desks.  There  are  three  in 
each row and three in each column.  Since there are four rows and four columns, there are 
4 + 3 · 4 =  24 pairs of adjacent desks. 
3 · 
Number these pairs of adjacent desks from 1 to 24. Let Fi  be an indicator for the event 
� � 
� 
that occupants of the desks in the i­th pair are ﬂirting. The probability we want is then: 
�

Ex (Fi ) 
Fi  =

Pr (Fi  =  1)

The ﬁrst step uses linearity of expectation, and the second uses the fact that the expecata­
tion of an indicator is equal to the probability that it is 1. 
The  occupants  of  adjacent  desks  are  ﬂirting  if  the  ﬁrst  holds  a  girl  and  the  second  a 
·
boy  or  vice  versa.  Each  of  these  events  happens with  probability

,  and  so  the

Problem  3.  There  is  a  nice  formula  for  the  expected  value  of  a  random  variable  R that 
� 
takes on only nonnegative integer values: 
∞
Pr (R > k) 
k=0 

Ex (R) = 

Proof.

Suppose we  roll 6  fair,  independent dice.  Let R be  the  largest number  that  comes up. 
Use the formula above to compute Ex (R). 

Solution.  The ﬁrst task is to compute Pr (R > k);  that is,  the probability that some die 
is greater than k . Let’s switch to computing the probability of the complementary event: 
Pr (R > k) =  1 − Pr (R ≤ k) 
Now Pr (R ≤ k) is  the probability  that  all  the dice  show  numbers  in  the  set  {1, . . . k}.  If 
k ≥  6, then this probability is 1.  For smaller k , the probability that one die shows a value 
in  this  range  is  k/6.  Since  the dice  are  independent,  the probability  that  all  6 dice  are  in 
� 
this range is (k/6)6 . Thus, we have:

Problem 4.  Here are seven propositions: 
∨ ¬x7 
x1  ∨ 
x3
x6  ∨ 
¬x5  ∨ 
x7
∨ ¬x4  ∨ 
x2 
x6
¬x4  ∨ 
∨ ¬x7 
x5
x3  ∨ ¬x5  ∨ ¬x8 
∨ ¬x8  ∨ 
x2
x9 
¬x3  ∨ 
x9  ∨ 
x4

Note that: 
1.  Each proposition is the OR of three terms of the form xi  or the form ¬xi . 
2.  The variables in the three terms in each proposition are all different. 

Suppose  that  we  assign  true/false  values  to  the  variables  x1 , . . . , x9  independently  and 
with equal probability. 

(a)  What is the expected number of true propositions? 
Solution.  Each proposition is true unless all three of its terms are false.  Thus, each 
proposition is true with probability:  � �31

Let Ti  be an indicator for the event that the i­th proposition is true. Then the number 
of true propositions is T1  + . . . + T7  and the expected number is: 

Ex (T1  + . . . + T7 ) =  Ex (T1 ) + . . . + Ex (T7 ) 
=  7/8 + . . . + 7/8

8 

=  49/8 =  6 

(b)  Use  your  answer  to  prove  that  there  exists  an  assignment  to  the  variables  that

makes all of the propositions true.

Solution.  A  random  variable  can  not  always  be  less  than  its  expectation,  so  there

must be some assignment such that:

T1  + . . . T7  ≥ 6 

1 
8 
This  implies  that  T1  + . . .   + T7  = 7 for  at  least  one  outcome.  This  outcome  is  an 
assignment to the variables such that all of the propositions are true.
