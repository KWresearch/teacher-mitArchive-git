1  Induction 

Recall the principle of induction: 

Principle of Induction. Let P (n) be a predicate.  If 

•  P (0) is true, and 
•  for all n ∈ N, P (n) implies P (n +  1), 

then P (n) is true for all n ∈ N. 

As  an  example,  let’s  try  to  ﬁnd  a  simple  expression  equal  to  the  following  sum  and 
then use induction to prove our guess correct. 
1  2  +  2  3  +  3  4  +  . . . +  n · (n +  1)  
·
·
· 

To help ﬁnd an equivalent expression, we could try evaluating the sum for some small 
n and (with the help of a computer) some larger n:

Unfortunately, the small sums are not too illuminating. However, the larger sums suggest 
we consider an expression similar to n3/3.  So in the third column we’ve multiplied each 
sum by 3  in hopes of spotting a sequence generated by an expression something  like n . 
3
From the ﬁrst few terms, you might guess that these new numbers are equal to n(n+1)(n+ 
2). Alternatively, you might notice that the last couple numbers are equal to n3  + 3n2  + 2n, 
which factors to n(n +  1)(n +  2).  So now we have a conjecture: 
Conjecture.  For all positive integers, n: 
·
·
·
1  2  +  2  3   +  3   4  +  . . . +  n(n +  1) = 

n(n +  1)(n +  2)  
3 
Let’s  use  induction  to  verify  this  conjecture.  Remember  that  an  induction  proof  has 
ﬁve parts, though the last one is often omitted: 

1.  Say that the proof is by induction. 

2.  Deﬁne the induction hypothesis, a predicate P  deﬁned on the natural numbers. 

3.  Handle the base case: prove that P (0) is true. 
4.  Handle the inductive step: prove that P (n) implies P (n +  1) for all integers n ≥ 0. 
5.  Conclude that P (n) is true for all n ∈ N by the principle of induction. 
We  noted  in  Lecture  that  while  the  base  case  is  usually  n  = 0,  it  could  be  any  non­
negative integer, k , in which case the conclusion would simply be that P (n) holds for all 
n ≥ k . 
Proof.  We use induction. Let P (n) be the proposition that: 
·
·
·
n(n +  1)(n +  2)  
(1)
1  2  +  2  3  +  3  4  +  . . . +  n(n +  1) = 
3 
Base case n = 1: P (1) is true, because the lefthand side of (??) is 1 · 2  = 2, and the righthand 
side is (1   2  · 3)/3   = 2.
·
Inductive step: We must show that P (n) implies P (n + 1)  for all n ≥ 1. So assume that P (n)  
is true, where n denotes a positive integer. Then we can reason as follows: 
1  2  +  2  3  +  · · · +  (n +  1)(n +  2)  
·
·
·
·
· · ·
= [1 2  +  2 3   + 
+  n(n +  1)]  +  (n +  1)(n +  2)  
n(n +  1)(n +  2)

n(n +  1)(n +  2) +  3(n +  1)(n +  2) 

3

(n +  1)(n +  2)(n +  3)

= 
3 
This shows that P (n +  1) is true, and so P (n) implies P (n +  1) for all n ≥ 1. 
By the induction principle, P (n) is true for all n ≥ 1, which proves the claim.

2  Problem: A Geometric Sum 

Perhaps you encountered this classic formula in school: 
1 − rn+1 
1 − r 
Use induction to prove that it is correct for all real values r  =  1
. 

1 + r + r 2  + r  + . . . + r n  =
3

3 

Prepare a complete, careful solution.  You’ll be passing your proof to another group for “construc­
tive criticism”!’ 
Solution. 

1 + r + r 2  + r  + . . . + r n  = 
3

Proof.  We  use  induction.  Let  P (n) be  the  proposition  that  the  following  equation  holds 
for all r  =  1:
1 − rn+1 
1 − r 
Base case: P (0) is true, because both sides of the equation are equal to 1. 
Inductive  step:  We must  show  that  P (n) implies  P (n + 1) for  all  n  ∈  N.  So  assume  that 
P (n) is true, where n denotes an arbitrary natural number. We can reason as follows: 
1 − rn+1 
n+1
1 − r 
+ r 
1 − rn+1  + (1 − r) · rn+1 
1 − r 
1 − rn+2 
1 − r 
The ﬁrst equation follows from the assumption P (n), and the remaining steps are simpli­
ﬁcations.  This proves  that P (n + 1) is also  true.  Therefore, P (n) implies P (n + 1) for all 
n ∈ N. By the principle of induction, P (n) is true for all n ∈ N. 

1 + r + r 2  + r  + . . . + r n  + r n+1  =

Note:  You may  have  encountered  a  different  proof  of  this  formula.  We’ll write  down  a 
sequence of equations and then explain the reasoning. 
S =  1 + r + r 2  + r  + . . . + r n

rS =  r + r 2  + r  + . . . + r 
3 
n+1
S − rS =  1 − r n+1 
1 − rn+1 
1 − r 
We deﬁne S on the ﬁrst line, multiply by r to get the second equation, subtract the second 
equation from the ﬁrst to get the third, and then solve for S . This gives the formula above! 
This argument is great!  It is a derivation of the formula rather than just a veriﬁcation. 
But,  at  some  level,  we’ve  only  hidden  the  use  of  induction,  since  the  operations  we’re 
doing on n­term sums are justiﬁed using— you guessed it— induction.

3  Problem: A False Proof 

In lecture, we proved that: 

n(n + 1)  
2 
But now we’re going to prove a contradictory theorem! 
False Theorem 1.  For all n ≥ 0, 

1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + n = 

2 + 3 + 4 + . . . + n = 

n(n + 1)  
2 

Proof.  We use induction. Let P (n) be the proposition that 2 + 3 + 4 + . . . + n =  n(n + 1)/2. 
Base case: P (0) is true, since both sides of the equation are equal to zero.  (Recall that a sum 
with no terms is zero.) 
Inductive  step:  Now we must  show  that P (n) implies P (n + 1) for all n  ≥  0.  So  suppose 
� 
� 
that P (n) is true; that is, 2 + 3 + 4 + . . . + n =  n(n + 1)/2. Then we can reason as follows: 
2 + 3 + 4 + . . . + n + (n + 1) =  2 + 3 + 4 + . . . + n  + (n + 1)  
n(n + 1)  
2 
(n + 1)(n + 2)  
2 
Above, we  group  some  terms,  use  the  assumption P (n),  and  then  simplify.  This  shows 
that P (n) implies P (n + 1). By the principle of induction, P (n) is true for all n ∈ N. 

+ (n + 1)

Where exactly is the error in this proof? 
Solution.  The  short  answer  is  that  we  failed  to  prove  P (0)   ⇒  P (1),  just  as  in  the 
colored horses problem in lecture.  In fact, once again, the error is rooted in the misleading 
nature of the “. . .” notation. 
More precisely, in the inductive step we are required to prove that P (n) implies P (n+1) 
for all n  ≥  0.  However,  the argument given above breaks down when n  =  0.  Let’s  look 
� 
� 
more closely at the ﬁrst equation in the indutive step to see why: 
2 + 3 + 4 + . . . + n + (n + 1) =  2 + 3 + 4 + . . . + n  + (n + 1)  
This seems completely innucuous; after all, we’ve only grouped terms! However, the left 
side  contains  no  terms when  n  = 0.  The  “. . .”  is  compeletely misleading  in  this  case;  2, 
3,  4,  and  n + 1 are  actually  not  in  the  sum.  This misimpression  becomes  an  error when 
we “pull out”  the  (n + 1) term on  the right side, disregarding  the  fact  that no such  term 
� 
� 
actually existed on the left. Thus, for n =  0, the equation we’ve just written down says:

The assertion 0  = 0  +  1  is false, and so we have not shown that P (0) implies P (1).  There 
is no way to ﬁx this problem and correctly prove that P (0) implies P (1), because actually 
P (0) is true and P (1) is false. 
Thus,  we’ve  only  established  P (0),  P (1)   ⇒  P (2),  P (2)   ⇒  P (3),  and  so  forth.  The 
induction argument falls apart because of the missing link P (0) �⇒ P (1).

4  Problem: The Volcanic Island 
There is a village on a volcanic island with b  ≥  1  blue­eyed people and g  ≥  0  green­eyed 
people.  There  are  no mirrors  and  no  one  ever  discusses  eye  color.  Therefore,  everyone 
knows  the  colors  of  everyone  elses’  eyes,  but  not  their  own.  Good  thing,  because  an 
islander who learns that he or she has blue eyes must leap into the volcano at the end of 
the same day! 
The  villagers  live  in happy  ignorance  for  years.  But  one day  an  explorer  arrives  and 
loudly proclaims,  “I  see  that  at  least  one person here has  blue  eyes.”  Assuming  that  all 
the villagers are master logicians, what happens? 

Recitation 3 

7 

What happens is that at the end of the bth day, all the blue­eyed villagers jump into the 
volcano. 
Use induction to prove that your conclusion is correct. We suggest the following hypoth­
esis P (n) that asserts all of the following are true on day n: 

1.  If b > n, then all blue­eyed people survive the day. 

2.  If b =  n, then all blue­eyed people jump into the volcano. 

3.  If b < n, then all blue­eyed people are already dead. 

Solution.  Note  that  a  green­eyed  villager  shouldn’t  ever  conclude  that  she  has  blue 
eyes,  since  she  doesn’t,  and  we’re  assuming  the  villagers  always  reason  correctly  from 
what  they know  (and what  they know  from  the explorer  is also  true).  So no green­eyed 
person should ever jump into the volcano. 

Theorem 2.  All the blue­eyed people jump into the volcano on day b. 

Proof.  We use induction.  Let P (n) be the proposition that all of the following are true on 
day n: 

1.  If b > n, then all blue­eyed people survive the day. 

2.  If b =  n, then all blue­eyed people jump into the volcano. 

3.  If b < n, then all blue­eyed people are already dead. 

Base case: We must verify that the three parts of P (n) hold on day n = 1. 

1.  Suppose  b > 1.  Consider  events  on day  1  from  the perspective  of  a  blue­eyed  vil­
lager. The explorer says that someone has blue eyes, and she can indeed see at least 
one other person with blue eyes.  Therefore, the facts available to her are consistent 
with her having either blue or green eyes.  So she survives the day. 

2.  Suppose  b = 1.  The  single blue­eyed villager  sees no one else with blue eyes,  con­
cludes that he must have blue eyes, and jumps into the volcano. No one else jumps 
in because everyone else does see the blue­eyed villager and they have no reason at 
this point to think they too are blue­eyed. 

3.  This  statement  is  vacuously  true,  because  the  if­part  (b < 1)  is  false;  the  problem 
statement says that b ≥ 1. 

Therefore, P (1) is true. 
Inductive step: Now suppose that P (n) is true where n ≥ 0. We must verify the three parts 
of P (n +  1). 

Recitation 3

1.  Suppose b > n + 1.  Then b > n so all the blue­eyed people survived the preceding 
day by part 1. of P (n). Furthermore, each blue­eyed villager can see at least n+1 > n 
other blue­eyed people, so the observation that everyone survives is consistent with 
she herself having either blue or green eyes by P (n) as well.  Thus, each blue­eyed 
villager survives the day. 

2.  Suppose b =  n + 1.  Then b > n, so all the blue­eyed people survived the preceding 
day by part 1. of P (n). Thus, on day n + 1 each blue­eyed villager knows b > n , but 
sees only n other people with blue eyes.  Thus, each blue­eyed villager realizes that 
she has blue eyes and jumps into the volcano. 

3.  Suppose  b < n + 1.  Then  either  b =  n (in which  case all blue­eyed people  jumped 
into  the volcano on day n by part  2. of P (n)) or  else  b < n (in which  case  all blue­
eyed­people were already dead on day n by part 3. of P (n)).  In either  case,  all  the 
blue­eyed people are already toast. 

Therefore P (n) implies P (n + 1) for all n ≥ 0. 
By the principle of induction, P (n) is true for all n ≥ 0, and the theorem follows.
