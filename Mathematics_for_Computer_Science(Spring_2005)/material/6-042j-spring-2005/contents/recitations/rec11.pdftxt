1  The Quest 

An  explorer  is  trying  to  reach  the  Holy  Grail,  which  she  believes  is  located  in  a  desert 
shrine  d  days  walk  from  the  nearest  oasis.  In  the  desert  heat,  the  explorer  must  drink 
continuously. She can carry at most 1 gallon of water, which is enough for 1 day. However, 
she is free to create water caches out in the desert. 
For example, if the shrine were 2/3 of a day’s walk into the desert, then she could recover 
the Holy  Grail with  the  following  strategy.  She  leaves  the  oasis with  1  gallon  of water, 
travels  1/3  day  into  the  desert,  caches  1/3  gallon,  and  then  walks  back  to  the  oasis— 
arriving  just as her water supply runs out.  Then she picks up another gallon of water at 
the oasis, walks 1/3 day into the desert, tops off her water supply by taking the 1/3 gallon 
in  her  cache,  walks  the  remaining  1/3  day  to  the  shine,  grabs  the Holy  Grail,  and  then 
walks for 2/3 of a day back to the oasis— again arriving with no water to spare. 
But what if the shrine were located farther away? 

(a)	 What  is  the  most  distant  point  that  the  explorer  can  reach  and  return  from  if  she 
takes only 1 gallon from the oasis.? 
Solution. At best she can walk 1/2 day into the desert and then walk back. 

(b)	 What  is  the most distant point  the  explorer  can  reach  and  return  form  if  she  takes 
only 2 gallons from the oasis? No proof is required; just do the best you can. 
Solution.  The explorer walks 1/4 day into the desert, drops 1/2 gallon, then walks 
home.  Next, she walks 1/4 day into the desert, picks up 1/4 gallon from her cache, 
walks  an  additional  1/2  day  out  and  back,  then  picks  up  another  1/4  gallon  from 
her cache and walks home.  Thus, her maximum distance from the oasis  is 3/4 of a 
day’s walk. 

(c)	 What about 3 gallons?  (Hint:  First, try to establish a cache of 2 gallons plus enough 
water for the walk home as far into the desert as possible.  Then use this cache as a 
springboard for your solution to the previous part.) 
Solution.  Suppose the explorer makes three trips 1/6 day into the desert, dropping 
2/3  gallon  off  units  each  time.  On  the  third  trip,  the  cache  has  2  gallons  of water, 
and the explorer still has 1/6 gallon for the trip back home.  So, instead of returning

immediately, she uses the solution described above to advance another 3/4 of a day 
into the desert and then returns home. Thus, she reaches

of a days’ walk into the desert. 

(d)	 How  can  the  explorer  go  as  far  as  possible  is  she  withdraws  n  gallons  of  water? 
Express your answer in terms of the Harmonic number Hn , deﬁned by:

Solution. With n gallons of water, the explorer can reach a point Hn/2 days into the 
desert. 
Suppose she makes n  trips 1/(2n) days  into  the desert, dropping off (n − 1)/n gal­
lons each time.  Before she  leaves the cache for the  last time, she has n gallons plus 
enough  for  the walk home.  So  she  applies her  (n − 1)­day  strategy  to  go  an  addi­
tional Hn−1/2 days  into  the desert and  then returns home.  Her maximum distance 
from the oasis is then: 
Hn−1  =

(e)  Use the fact that 

Hn  ∼  ln n 
to approximate your previous answer in terms of logarithms. 

Solution. An approximate answer is (ln n)/2.


(f)	 Suppose  that  the  shrine  is  d  =  10  days walk  into  the  desert.  Relying  on  your  ap­
proximate  answer,  how  many  days  must  the  explorer  travel  to  recover  the  Holy 
Grail? 
Solution.  She obtains the Grail when:

This requires about n ≥ e20  = 4.8 · 108  days.

Deﬁnitions.  Intuitively and precisely the notations mean the following: 

cheat sheet 

f  = Θ(g)  f grows as fast as g 

f  = O(g)  f grows no faster than g 

f  = Ω(g)  f grows no slower than g 

f  = o(g) 

f grows slower than g 

f  = ω(g) 

f grows faster than g 

f  ∼ g 

f /g approaches 1 

There  exists  n0  and  c1 , c2  >  0  such  that 
for all n > n0 :  c1g(n) ≤  |f (n)| ≤ c2g(n). 
There  exists  n0  and  c  >  0  such  that 
for all n > n0 :  |f (n)| ≤ cg(n). 
There  exists  n0  and  c  >  0  such  that 
for all n > n0 :  cg(n) ≤  |f (n)|. 
For  all  c  >  0,  there  exists  n0  such  that 
for all n > n0 :  |f (n)| ≤ cg(n). 
For  all  c  >  0,  there  exists  n0  such  that 
for all n > n0 :  cg(n) ≤  |f (n)|. 
limn→∞ f (n)/g(n) = 1 

Relationships.  Some asymptotic relationships between functions imply others:


f  = O(g) and f  = Ω(g)  ⇔  f  = Θ(g) 
f  = O(g)  ⇔  g = Ω(f ) 
f  = o(g)  ⇔  g = ω(f ) 

f  = o(g)  ⇒  f  = O(g)

f  = ω(g)  ⇒  f  = Ω(g)

f  ∼ g  ⇒  f  = Θ(g)


Limits.  If the limn→∞ f (n)/g(n) exists, it reveals a lot about the relationship of f  and g : 

limn→∞ f /g = 0, ∞ ⇒  f  = Θ(g) 
� ∞
⇒  f  = O(g) 
limn→∞ f /g = 
⇒  f  = Ω(g) 
limn→∞ f /g = 0 

⇒  f  ∼ g 
limn→∞ f /g = 1 
limn→∞ f /g = 0  ⇒  f  = o(g)
∞ ⇒ 
limn→∞ f /g = 
f  = ω(g)

In this context, L’Hospital’s Rule is often useful: 
g(n) = ∞,  then  lim 
f (n) = ∞ and  lim

Logarithms vs. polynomials vs. exponentials. Everybody knows the following two facts:

� 
� 
•  polylogarithms grow slower than polynomials:  for all a, b > 0,  (ln n)a  = o(nb ). 
•  polynomials grow slower than exponentials:  for all b, c > 0,  nb  = o  (1 + c)n 
.
