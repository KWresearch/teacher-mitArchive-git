1  Stencil the ﬂea 

There  is  a  small  ﬂea  named  Stencil.  To  his  right,  there  is  an  endless  ﬂat  plateau.  One 
inch  to  his  left  is  the  Cliff  of  Doom,  which  drops  to  a  raging  sea  ﬁlled  with  ﬂea­eating 
monsters. 

Each  second,  Stencil  hops  1  inch  to  the  right  or  1  inch  to  the  left with  equal probability, 
independent of the direction of all previous hops.  If he ever lands on the very edge of the 
cliff, then he teeters over and falls into the sea. 

Our  job  is  to  analyze  the  life  of  Stencil.  Does  he  have  any  chance  of  avoiding  a  fatal 
plunge?  If not, how long will he hop around before he takes the plunge?

Problem 1.  Let’s begin with a simpler problem.  Suppose that Stencil is n inches from the 
left side of an island w inches across: 

In  other  words,  Stencil  starts  at  position  n,  for  some  0  ≤  n  ≤  w and  there  are  cliffs  at 
positions 0 and w .  Let Rn  be  the probability he  falls  to  the  right off  the Cliff of Disaster, 
given that he starts at position n. 

(a)	 What are the values of R0  and Rn? When 0 < n < w , can you express Rn  in terms 
of Rn−1  and Rn+1?  (Hint: Total Probability!) 
Solution.  If n =  w , he  starts at position w and  immediately  falls  from  the Cliff of 
Disaster, so Rw  =  1.  On the other hand,  if he starts at position 0,  then he falls from 
the Cliff of Doom immediately, so R0  =  0. 
Now suppose that he stands somewhere in the middle of the island, so that 0 < n < 
w .  Then we can break the analysis of his fate  into two cases based on  the direction 
of his ﬁrst hop: 
•	 If his ﬁrst hop is to the left, then he lands at position n − 1 and eventually falls 
off the Cliff of Disaster with probability Rn−1 . 
•	 On the other hand, if his ﬁrst hop is to the right, then he lands at position n + 1  
and eventually falls off the Cliff of Disaster with probability Rn+1 . 

Therefore, by the Total Probability Theorem, we have: 

1 
1
Rn  =  Rn−1  +  Rn+1

(b)	 Solve the linear recurrence (you don’t see any linear recurrence?  talk to your TA!) 
to ﬁnd Rn .  (There is our usual guide on the last page.) 
Solution.  We rearrange the terms in the recurrence equation: 
Rn+1  =  2Rn  − Rn−1 

The characteristic equation is: 

2 x	 − 2x + 1 =  0 
This  equation  has  a  double  root  at  x  = 1.  There  is  no  inhomogenous  part,  so  the 
general solution has the form: 
Rn  =  a · 1n 

+ b · 
n1n  =  a + bn

Substituting in the boundary conditions R0  =  0 and Rw  =  1 gives two linear equa­
tions: 

0 = a 
1 = a  + bw  

The  solution  to  this  system  is a  =  0,  b  =  1/w .  Therefore,  the  solution  to  the  recur­
rence is: 

Rn  = n/w 

(c)	 So you know the probability that Stencil falls off the right side.  Can you quickly 
deduce the probability that he will . . . falls off the left side?  . . . lives on forever? 
Solution.  We exploit the symmetry of the problem:  the probability that he falls off 
the  left  side  starting  at  position  n  is  the  same  as  the  probability  that  he  falls  of  the 
right side starting at position w  − n, which is (w  − n)/n. 
This  is  bad  news.  The  probability  that  Stencil  eventually  falls  off  one  cliff  or  the 
other is: 
w  − n 
n 
w 
w
There’s no hope! The probability that he hops around on the island forever is zero.

(d)	 Now  let’s  go  back  to  the  original  problem,  where  Stencil  is  1  inch  from  the  left 
edge of an inﬁnite plateau. What is the probability that he lives on forever? 
Solution.  The probability that he eventually falls into the sea is: 
w  − 1

Our little friend is doomed!

Problem 2.  By now you must already know  the  tragic  fate  that awaits poor  little Stencil 
the ﬂea.  On the bright side,  though, Stencil may get to hop around for a while before he 
sinks beneath the waves. Let’s ﬁnd out how much he is expected to live. We should begin 
with the simpler setup as before: 

Let Xn  be the expected number of hops he takes before falling off a cliff. 

(a)	 What are the values of X0  and Xw ?  If 0 < n < w , can you express Xn  in terms of 
Xn−1  and Xn?  (Hint: Total Expectation!) 
Solution.  If he starts at either edge of the island, then he dies immediately: 

X0  = 0 
Xw  = 0 

If he  starts  somewhere  in  the middle of  the  island  (0 < n < w),  then we  can again 
break down the analysis into two cases based on his ﬁrst hop: 
•	 If his ﬁrst hop  is  to  the  left,  then he  lands  at position  n − 1 and  can  expect  to 
live for another Xn−1  steps. 
•	 If his ﬁrst hop  is  to  the right,  then he  lands at position n + 1 and his expected 
lifespan is Xn+1 . 

Thus, by the Total Expectation Theorem and linearity, his expected lifespan is: 

1 
1
Xn  = 1 +  Xn−1  +  Xn+1
2

The leading 1 accounts for his ﬁrst hop. 


(b)	 Now you should solve the recurrence. 

Solution.  We can rewrite the last line as:

Xn+1  = 2Xn  − Xn−1  − 2 

As before, the characteristic equation is: 
2 x	 − 2x + 1 = 0

There is a double­root at 1, so the homogenous solution has the form: 

Xn  =  a  + bn 

There’s an inhomogenous term, so we also need to ﬁnd a particular solution.  Since 
this  term  is a constant, we should  try a particular  solution of  the  form Xn  =  c  and 
then try Xn  =  c + dn  and then Xn  =  c + dn  + en2  and so forth. As it turns out, the ﬁrst 
two possibilities don’t work, but the third does.  Substituting in this guess gives: 
Xn+1  =  2Xn  − Xn−1  − 2 
c  + d(n  + 1) + e(n  + 1)2  =  2(c  + dn  + en  ) − (c   + d(n  − 1) + e(n   − 1) ) − 2 
2	
2
e  =  −1 
All the c  and d  terms cancel, so Xn  =  c  + dn  − n2  is a particular solution for all c  and 
d.  For simplicity, let’s take c  =  d  =  0. Thus, our particular solution is Xn  =  −n . 
2
Adding the homogenous and particular solutions gives the general form of the so­
lution: 

Xn  =  a  + bn  − n 2 

Substituting in the boundary conditions X0  =  0 and Xw  =  0 gives two linear equa­
tions: 

0 =  a 
0 =  a  + bw   − w 2 

The  solution  to  this  system  is  a  = 0 and  b  =  w .  Therefore,  the  solution  to  the 
recurrence equation is: 
Xn  =  wn  − n 2  =  n(w  − n) 

(c)	 Return to the original problem, where Stencil has the Cliff of Doom 1 inch to his 
left and an inﬁnite plateau to this right: What is his expected lifespan there? 
Solution.  In this case, his expected lifespan is: 
lim  1(w  − 1) =  ∞
w→∞ 

Yes, Stencil is expected to live forever! 

(d)	 Compare  your  answer  to  the  previous  part  and  your  answer  to  the  last  part  of 
the previous problem. Anything troublesome? 
Solution. 
So,  Stencil  is  certain  to  eventually  fall  off  the  cliff  into  the  sea—  but 
his  expected  lifespan  is  inﬁnite!  This  sounds  almost  like  a  contradiction,  but  both 
answers are correct!

Here’s  an  informal  explanation.  The  probability  that  Stencil  falls  from  the Cliff  of 
Doom  on  the  k ­th  step  is  approximately  1/k3/2  .  Thus,  the  probability  that  he  falls 
�  1
eventually is: 
∞
k3/2 
k=1 
You can verify by integration that this sum converges.  The exact sum actually con­
1  �  1 
� 
verges to 1. On the other hand, the expected time until he falls is: 
∞
∞
√
=

k=1 

Ex  (hops until fall)  ≈ 

Pr  (falls off cliff)   ≈

And you can verify by integration that this sum diverges.  So our answers are com­
patible!
