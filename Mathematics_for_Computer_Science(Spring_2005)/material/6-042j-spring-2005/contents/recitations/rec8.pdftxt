1  Graphs  and  Trees 

The   following  two  deﬁnitions  of  a   tree  are  equivalent. 
Deﬁnition  1:  A tree  is  an  acyclic  graph  of   n  vertices  that  has  n  − 1  edges. 
Deﬁnition  2:  A  tree  is  a  connected  graph  such  that  ∀u,   v   ∈  V  ,  there  is  a  unique  path 
connecting  u  to  v . 
In  general,  when  we  want  to  show  the  equivalence  of  two   deﬁnitions,  we  must  show  
that  if   the   ﬁrst  deﬁnition   is  met,  so  is  the  second,  and  vice  versa.  (1)   =⇒ (2)   Suppose  that 
G  is  an  acyclic  graph   with  |E | =  |V  | − 1.  We  need  to   demonstrate   the  following  two  facts: 

1.  There  is  a  unique   path   connecting  any   pair  of  vertices.  The  proof   is  by  contradic­
tion.  Suppose  that  there  exists  a   pair  of  vertices  (u,   v ) with  two   distinct  paths  p1  and 
← 
p2  connecting  u  to  v . In   more  “graphic”  terms,  we  have  u  �  v  and  u  �  v .  Let  p2 
p1
p2
← 
be  the  reverse   of  path   p2  (which  takes  us  from  v  to  u).  Then  u  �  v  �  u  is  a   cycle 
p1
p2
from  u  back  to  u,  which  contradicts  the  fact  that  G  is  an  acyclic  graph.  Therefore,  we 
conclude  that  there  exists  a   unique  path  between  any  two  pairs  of  vertices. 
2.   G  is  connected.  We  want  to  prove  that  an  acyclic  graph  G  with  n  vertices  and  n  − 1 
edges   is  connected.  The  proof   is  by   induction  on  the  number  of  vertices  of  G. 
Base  case:  For  n  = 1  and  n  = 2  the  claim  holds,  since  in  both  cases,  a  graph   with 
n − 1  edges  is  connected.   Inductive  step:  Assume  that  the  claim  is  true  for  all   graphs 
up  to  size  n.  Consider  an   acyclic  graph  G  with  n  + 1  vertices  and  n  edges.  At  least 
one   of  the  vertices   must  have  degree  1  (see  note  1 ).  Now  take  that  vertex   of   degree 
1  and  remove  it,   along   with   the  associated  edge.  The  graph  G(cid:3)  that  remains  has  n 
vertices   and  n  − 1  edges   and  is  connected  according  to  our  induction  hypothesis. 
We  then  restore  the  vertex  we  removed  to  get  back   to  G  and  notice  that  G  must  also 
be  connected   because  the  subgraph  G(cid:3)  is  connected,  and  the  vertex  v  we  just   took  
out  is  connected  to  the  subgraph  through  its  edge. 
1Since   there  are  n  edges,  the  sum  of  the  degrees  of  the   vertices  is  2n.  There   are   n  + 1  vertices,  which 
means  that  at  least  one  vertex  must  have  degree  either   0  or  1  (if  they  all  had   degree  2  or  more,  the  sum 
of  the  degrees  would  be  ≥  2n  + 2).  The  0-degree  vertex  is  actually  imposible,   because   the  subgraph  of   n 
vertices  would  have  n  edges,  and  this  would   create  a  cycle  (see  the   second   inductive   proof).   Therefore,   at 
least  one  vertex  has  to  have  degree   exactly  1.

(2)   =⇒ (1)Starting  from  a  graph   G  that  satisﬁes  the  second  deﬁnition,we  want  to  show 
that  the  following  two  things   must  be  true: 

1.   G  is  acyclic  We  can  prove  this  by   conradiction.  Suppose  that  there  is  a   cycle   in  G, 
and  take  any  pair  (u,   v ) of  vertices  in  the  cycle.  Since  we  are  in  a  cycle,   we  know  that 
there’s   a  path  p1  connecting  u  to  v  and  another,  different  path  p2  connecting   v  to  u. 
But  then   taking  path   p2  in  reverse  would  take  us  from  u  to  v ,  which  contradicts  the  
assumption  that  there’s   a  unique  path  connecting   every  pair  of  vertices.  Therefore,  
we   conclude  that  G  must  be  aclyclic. 
2.  G  has  n  − 1  edges.   We  know  that  G  is  a   connected  graph  and  above  we  showed 
that  it  must  also   be  acyclic.  In  class  we  showed  that  an  acyclic  graph  with  n  vertices 
needs  at  least  n  − 1  edges   to  be  connected.  We  now  need  to  prove  that  it  can  have  at 
most  n  − 1  edges   (otherwise,  it  will  not  be  acyclic).  The   proof  is  by   induction  on  n. 
Base  case:  For  n  = 0  and  n  = 1,  a  connected,  acyclic  graph  can  have  at  most  n  − 1 
edges. 
Inductive  step:   Assume  that  all  connected,  acyclic  graphs  with  n  vertices  or  less 
have  ≤  n  − 1  edges.  Consider  a   connected,  acyclic  graph  G  with  n  + 1   vertices. 
Remove  a  vertex  v  along  with  all   incident  edges.  This  will   create  k  ≥  1  connected 
components2 .  Each  connected  component  is  connected  (by   deﬁnition)  and  acyclic 
(since  G  was   acyclic).   Therefore  by   our  induction  hypothesis,  the  ith  connected 
component  (1  ≤  i  ≤  k) can  have  at  most  |Vi | − 1  edges.  Thus  the  total  number  of 
edges   will  be  at  most  n  − k .  Now,  we  bring   back  the  vetex   we  removed  along  with 
all  its  incident  edges.  Notice  that  since   G  is  acyclic,  the  vertex  cannot  be  connected 
to  each  component  with  more  than  one  edges3 .  This  means  that  the  number  of  new 
edges   is  at  most  k ,  which  brings  our  total  number  of  edges  to  at  most  n  − k  +  k  =  n. 
Thus,  the  claim   holds   for  G  as  well. 

2 the  case   k  = 1  corresponds  to  the  situation  in  which  the  removal  of  the  vertex   leaves  us  with  a   connected 
subgraph  (one  piece) 
3 If  there  were  two  edges  connecting   the   vertex  to  a   connected   component,  we   could  go  from   the  vertex 
to  the   connected  component   through   the  ﬁrst  edge,  then  ﬁnd  a  path  to  the   second  connection  point   [guar­
anteed  to  exist  b/c  we  are  in  a  connected  component]  and   return  to  the  original  vertex  through  the  second 
edge.  This  would  contradict   the   assumption  that  our  original  graph  was  acyclic

Rules:   Teams   take  questions  in  cyclic  order.  Each  team  has  15  seconds  to  answer.  A 
correct  answer  is  worth  1 point.  If  a  team   can  not  answer  a  question  correctly,  the  question 
goes   to  the  next  team.  If  no  team  can  answer,  the  TA gets  a  point  and  provides  the  answer.  
This  test  is  open   book.   Between  problems,  the  game  may  stop  for  questions.  The  TA  can 
change   the  rules   in  any  way  he  or  she  sees  ﬁt  at  any  time. 
Here   is  a  picture  of  a  graph   G  = (V , E ).

(The   edge  E—D  is  absent  initially,  but  will  be  added  later.) 

1.   What  are  the  elements  of  V  called?  Vertices. 

2.  What  are  the  elements  of  E  called?  Edges. 
3.  What  are  the  elements  of  V  in  this  case?  {A, B , C, D , E , F } 
4.   What  are  the  elements   of  E  in  this  case?  {A—B , A—C, B—C, B—D , C—D , E—F } 
5.  Is  this  graph  connected?  No. 

6.  What  is   the  deﬁnition  of  connected,  anyway?  A  graph  is  connected  if  there  is  a  path 
between  every  pair  of  vertices. 

7.  What  is   a  connected  component  of   a  graph?  A  maximal,  connected  subgraph.  Here, 
maximal  means  that  including   any   more  vertices  would  yield  a   disconnected  sub­
graph. 

8.  What  are  the  connected  components  of  this  graph? 

•	 The  subgraph   consisting  of  vertices  E  and  F  and  the  edge  between  them.  
•	 The  subgraph  consisting   of  vertices  A,  B ,  C ,  and  D  and  the  edges  between 
them. 

9.	 Now  suppose  we  add  the  edge  E—D .  Is  the  graph  connected  now?  Yes. 

10.  What  is   the  distance  between   A and  D? 2

11.  How   is   the  distance  between   vertices  x  and  y deﬁned?  It  is  the  length  of   the   shortest 
path  between   x  and  y . 

12.  What  is  the  diameter  of  this  graph?  4  

13.  How  is   diameter  deﬁned?  It  is  the  distance  between  the  farthest  pair  of  vertices.  (A 
and  F  in  this   case.) 

14.  Is  this  a  tree?  No. 

15.  What  is  a  tree,  anyway?  A connected,  acyclic  graph.  (However,  there  are  many  other 
equivalent  ways  to  characterize  a   tree  and  any  one  could  be  taken  as  the  deﬁnition.) 

16.  How  many  different  cycles   are  there?  Three.	 One  with  vertices  A,  B ,  C ,  one   with 
vertices,  B ,  C ,  D ,  and  one  with  vertices  A,  B ,  C ,  and  D . 

17.  What’s   a  spanning  tree  of   this  graph?  There  are  several;  one  is  the  subgraph  with 
vertices   A  through  F  and  edges  A—B ,  B—C ,  B—D ,  E—D ,  and  E—F .  Later  an­
swers   assume  this  one. 

18.  What  is  a  spanning  tree  of  a  graph  G  = (V , E ) anyhow? A tree  with  vertex   set  V 
and  edge  set  E (cid:3)  ⊆ E . 
19.  Does  every  graph  have  a  spanning  tree?  No,  but  every  connected  graph  does. 

20.  For  the  remaining  questions,  let’s  focus  on  that  spanning  tree.	 Which  vertices  are 
the   leaves   of  this  tree?  A,  C ,  and  F 

21.  Does  there  exist  a   tree  with   the  same  number  of  vertices,  but  a  different  number   of 
edges?  No.  For  every   tree,  |V | =  |E | + 1. 
22.  Does  there  exist  a   tree  with   the  same  number  of  vertices,  but  a  different  number   of 
leaves—  yes   or  no?  Yes.  

23.  What’s  an  example  of  a   6-vertex  tree  NOT  isomorphic  to  the  spanning  tree?  One 
example  is   a   path  of  length  5. 

24.  What  exactly   does   it  mean   for   two   graphs  to   be  isomorphic?  There  is  a  a  one-to-one 
correspondence  between   the  vertices  in  the  two  graphs  such  that  there   is  an  edge 
between  two   vertices  in   the  ﬁrst  graph  if  and  only  if   there  is  an  edge  between  the 
two  corresponding  vertices  in  the  second  graph. 

25.  How   can  you  prove  this   spanning  tree  is  not  isomorphic  to  the  one  two  questions 
back?  In   general,   the  simplest  way  is  to  identify   some  distinguishing   property,  such 
as  the  number  of  vertices,  number  of   edges,  number  of   leaves,  or  pattern  of   vertex 
degrees.  Any  argument  along   these  lines  is  sufﬁcient.
