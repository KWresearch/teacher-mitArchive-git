1  Solving linear recurrences 

Guessing a particular solution.  Recall that a general linear recurrence has the form: 
f (n) = a1f (n − 1) + a2f (
n − 2) + · · ·
+ adf (n − d) + g(n)
As  explained  in  lecture,  one  step  in  solving  this  recurrence  is  ﬁnding  a  particular  solu­
tion;  i.e., a  function f (n) that satisﬁes  the recurrence, but may not be consistent with  the 
boundary conditions. Here’s a recipe to help you guess a particular solution: 

•	 If g(n) is a constant, guess that f (n) is some constant c. Plug this into the recurrence 
and see if any constant actually works.  If not, try f (n) = bn + c, then f (n) = an2  + 
bn + c, etc. 

•	 More generally, if g(n) is a polynomial, try a polynomial of the same degree.  If that 
fails,  try  a  polynomial  of  degree  one  higher,  then  two  higher,  etc.  For  example,  if 
g(n) = n, then try f (n) = bn + c and then f (n) = an + bn + c.

•	 If g(n) is an exponential, such as 3n , then ﬁrst guess that f (n) = c3n . Failing that, try 
f (n) = bn3n  + c3n  and then an23n  + bn3n  + c3n , etc. 

In practice, your ﬁrst or second guess will almost always work. 

Dealing with repeated roots. 
In lecture we saw that the solutions to a linear recurrence 
are determined by the roots of the characteristic equation: For each root r of the equation, 

the function rn  is a solution to the recurrence. 

Taking a linear combination of these solutions, we can move on to ﬁnd the coefﬁcients. 
The  situation  is  a  little  more  complicated  when  r  is  a  repeated  root  of  the  characteristic 
equation:  if its multiplicity is k , then (not only rn , but) 
each of the functions  r ,  nr ,  n r ,  . . . ,  nk−1rn 
n

is a solution to the recurrence, 

so that our linear combination must use all of them.

2  Mini­Tetris (again)

Remember Mini­Tetris from Recitation 4? Here is an overview: A winning conﬁguration in 
the game is a complete tiling of a 2 × n board using only the three shapes shown below: 

For example, the several possible winning conﬁgurations on a 2 × 5 board include: 

In  that past  recitation, we had deﬁned Tn  to be  the number of different winning  conﬁg­
urations on a 2 × n board.  Then we had  to  inductively prove Tn  equals  some particular 
closed form expression.  Remember that expression?  Probably not.  But no damage, now 
you can ﬁnd it on your own. 

(a)  Determine the values of T1 , T2 , and T3 .

Solution.  T1  = 1, T2  = 3, and T3  = 5.


(b)  Find a recurrence equation that expresses Tn  in terms of Tn−1  and Tn−2 . 
Solution.  Every winning conﬁguration on a 2 × n board  is of one  three  types, dis­
tinguished by the arrangment of pieces at the top of the board. 

n − 1 

n − 2 

n − 2 

There are Tn−1  winning conﬁgurations of the ﬁrst type, and there are Tn−2  winning 
conﬁgurations  of  each  of  the  second  and  third  types.  Overall,  the number  of win­
ning conﬁgurations on a 2 × n board is: 

Tn  = Tn−1  + 2Tn−2

(c)  Find a closed­form expression for Tn . 
Solution.  The characteristic polynomial is r2 − r − 2 = (r − 2)(r + 1), so the solution 
is  of  the  form  A2n  + B (−1) .  Setting  n  =  1,  we  have  1  =  T1  =  2A − B .  Setting 
n
n = 2, we have 3 = T2  = A22  + B (−1) = 4A + B .  Solving these two equations, we

conclude A = 2/3 and B  = 1/3. That is, the closed form expression for Tn  is

3  Inhomogeneous linear recurrences 

Find a closed­form solution to the following linear recurrence. 

T0  = 0 
T1  = 1 
Tn  = Tn−1  + Tn−2  + 1 

(*) 

(a)  First ﬁnd the general solution to the corresponding homogenous recurrence. 
Solution.  The  characteristic  equation  is  r − r − 1 = 0.  The  roots  of  this  equation

(b)  Now ﬁnd a particular solution to the inhomogenous recurrence. 
Solution.  Since the inhomogenous term is constant, we guess a constant solution, c. 
So replacing the T  terms in (*) by c, we require 

c = c + c + 1, 
namely, c = −1. That is, Tn  ≡ −1 is a particular solution to (*).

ular solution. Use the initial conditions to ﬁnd the coefﬁcients.

4  Back to homogeneous ones 

Let’s get back to homogeneous linear recurrences. Find a closed­form solution to this one. 

S0  = 0 
S1  = 1 
Sn  = 6Sn−1  − 9Sn−2 

Anything strange? 
Solution.  The characteristic polynomial is r − 6r + 9 = (r − 3)2 , so we have a repeated 
2
root:  r = 3, with multiplicity 2. The solution is of the form A3n + Bn3n  for some constants 
A and B .  Setting n  = 0, we have 0 =  S0  =  A30  + B  ·
0 ·
30  =  A.  Setting n  = 1, we have 
1 = S1  = A31  + B ·

31  = 3B , so B  = 1/3. That is,

Sn  = 0 · 3n  +

Short Guide to Solving Linear Recurrences 

A linear recurrence is an equation

f (n) = a1f (n − 1) + a2f (n − 2) + . . . + adf (n − d)
+g(n)
inhomogeneous part 
homogeneous part 
together with boundary conditions such as f (0) = b0 , f (1) = b1 , etc. 

1.  Find the roots of the characteristic equation: 
n x  = a1x n−1  + a2x n−2  + . . . + ak 

2.  Write  down  the  homogeneous  solution.  Each  root  generates  one  term  and  the  homoge­
n
neous solution is the sum of these terms. A nonrepeated root r generates the term cr r , 
where cr  is a constant to be determined later. A root r with multiplicity k generates the 
terms: 
crk n k−1 r 
n 

. . . , 

where cr1 , . . . , c
rk 

2  n
n 
n
cr3 n r , 
cr2 nr , 
cr1 r , 
are constants to be determined later. 

3.  Find a particular solution.  This  is a solution  to  the  full recurrence  that need not be con­
sistent  with  the  boundary  conditions.  Use  guess  and  verify.  If  g(n)  is  a  polynomial, 
try a polynomial of the same degree, then a polynomial of degree one higher, then two 
higher, etc. For example, if g(n) = n, then try f (n) = bn + c and then f (n) = an2 + bn + c. 
If  g(n)  is  an  exponential,  such  as  3n ,  then ﬁrst guess  that  f (n) =  c3n .  Failing  that,  try 
f (n) = bn3n  + c3n  and then an23n  + bn3n  + c3n , etc. 

4.  Form the general solution, which is the sum of the homogeneous solution and the partic­
ular solution. Here is a typical general solution:

5.  Substitute the boundary conditions into the general solution. Each boundary condition 
gives a  linear equation  in  the unknown constants.  For example,  substituting f (1)  =  2 
into the general solution above gives: 
2 = c · 21  + d · (−1)1  + 3 · 1 + 1 
⇒ −2 = 2c − d 

Determine the values of these constants by solving the resulting system of linear equa­
tions.
