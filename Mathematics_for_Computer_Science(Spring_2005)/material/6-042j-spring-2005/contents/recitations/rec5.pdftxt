1  Well­ordering principle 

Every non­empty set of natural numbers has a minimum element.


Do you believe this statement?  Seems obvious, right?  Well,  it is.  But don’t fail to realize 
how  tight  it  is.  Crucially,  it  talks  about  a  non­empty  set —otherwise,  it would  clearly  be 
false.  And it also talks about natural numbers —otherwise,  it might again be false:  think 
for example what would happen with the integers, or even the positive rational numbers. 
This  statement  has  a  name,  it  is  called  the  well­ordering  principle.  And,  as  most 
things we give names to, it’s important. Why? Because it is equivalent to induction. 

Something can be proved by induction iff it can be proved by the well­ordering principle. 

We could go on and give a general proof of this, but we won’t.  Instead, we’ll just convince 
ourselves of it by going through an example. We’ll reprove something that in the very ﬁrst 
lecture (see Lecture Notes “Induction I”) was proved by induction. Read the next page. 
For reference, here is the outline that a proof by the well­ordering principle has.  (Compare 
it with the corresponding outline of a proof by strong induction.) 

To prove that “P (n) is true for all n ∈ N” using the well­ordering principle: 

•	 Use proof by contradiction. 

•	 Assume that P (n) has counterexamples.  I.e., that P (n) is false on at least one n. 
•	 Deﬁne the set of counterexamples C =  {n ∈ N  | ¬P (n)}. 
•	 Invoke the well­ordering principle to select the minimum element c of C . 
•	 Since  c  is  the  smallest  counterexample  to  P (n),  conclude  that  both  ¬P (c)  and 
P (0), P (1), . . . , P (c − 1).  Use  these  to  arrive  at  a  contradiction.  Watch out:  the 
list 0, 1, . . . , c − 1  will contain no numbers at all if c = 0. 
•	 Conclude that P (n) must have no counterexamples. Namely, that (∀n)P (n).

Theorem.  For all n   ∈ N:  1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n  =  n(n
+1)  . 
2
Proof.  By  contradiction.  Assume  that  the  theorem  is  false.  Then,  some  natural  numbers 
�

serve as counterexamples to it. Let’s collect them in a set: 
C  =  n  ∈ N  |  1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n  =  n(n
+1) 
. 
2
By  our  assumption  that  the  theorem  admits  counterexamples,  C  is  a  non­empty  set  of 
natural numbers.  So, by the well­ordering principle, C  has a minimum element, call it c. 
That is, c  is the smallest counterexample to the theorem. 
Since c  is a counterexample (c  ∈ C ), we know that 
1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + c  =  c(c+1)  .
2 

Since  c  is  the  smallest  counterexample  (c  minimum  of  C ),  we  know  the  theorem  holds 
for  all  natural  numbers  smaller  than  c.  (Otherwise,  at  least  one  of  them  would  also  be 
in C  and would therefore prevent c  from being the minimum of C .)  [∗] In particular, the 
theorem is true for c  − 1. That is, 
1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + (c  − 1) =  (c−1)c  .
2 

But then, adding c  to both sides we get 
1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + (c  − 1) + c  =  (c−1)c  + c

c(c+1)  ,

which means the theorem does hold for c, after all! That is, c  is not a counterexample. But 
this is a contradiction. And we are done. 
Well, almost. Our argument contains a bug. Everything we said after [∗] bases on the fact 
that c  − 1 actually exists.  That is,  that there is indeed some natural number smaller than 
c. How do we know that? How do we know that c  is not 0? Fortunately, this can be ﬁxed. 
We know c  =  0 because c  is a counterexample whereas 0 is not, as 0 =  0(0 + 1)/2.

Here is the geometric sum formula, which you proved in a previous recitation. 
1 − rn+1 
1 + r + r 2  + r  + . . . + r n  =

Use the well­ordering principle to prove that, when r =  1, the formula is true for all n ∈ N. 
Prepare a complete, careful solution!

Proof.  By  contradiction.  Suppose  the  theorem  is  not  true  on  all  natural  numbers,  but 
� 
� 
instead it admits some counterexamples. Let C be the set of these counterexamples: 
1 + r + r 2  + · · · + r n  = 
C =  n ∈ N 
|
. 
By our assumption, C is a non­empty set of natural numbers.  So, the well­ordering prin­
ciple  guarantees  C  has  a minimum  element  c.  So,  c  is  the  smallest  counterexample  to  the 
theorem. 
Because c is a counterexample, we know 
1 + r + r 2  + · · · + r c  =�
1−rc+1 
.
1−r 
Because 1 =  (1 − r1 )/(1 − r), we know 0 is not a counterexample, and therefore c > 0. 
Because c is the smallest counterexample, we know all numbers smaller than c satisfy the 
theorem —and such numbers do exist, as c > 0.  In particular, c − 1 satisﬁes the theorem 
1 + r + r 2  + · · · + r c−1  =  1−r  . 
1−rc 
But then, adding rc  to both sides of the equation, we get 
1 + r + r 2  + · · · + r c−1  + r  =  1−r  + r c 
=  1−r  [1 − r c  + r  − r c+1 ] = 
1−rc

which implies c is not really a counterexample, a contradiction. 
Therefore, there can’t be any counterexamples to the theorem. The theorem is true.

3  Problem: A robot 

4 

A robot lives on a two dimensional grid and is free to walk around. However each move 
it makes is always one step north or south and one step east or west.  Its purpose in life is 
to  reach point  (1, 0).  Unfortunately,  the  robot was born  at point  (0, 0).  Prove  that  it will 
never see how point (1, 0)  looks like. 
Solution.  The  approach  that  seems  reasonable  is  to  use  induction  on  the  number  n  of 
moves made by  the  robot.  But we must be  careful  in  selecting  the  inductive hypothesis 
P (n).  If it simply corresponds to what we want to prove —that is,  if it simply is “after n 
steps the robot  is not at point (1, 0)”— we are bound  to encounter the same problems as 
in class against the 9­Number Puzzle.  So, we must prove something stronger. 
Trying out  several paths  that  the  robot might  take, we  soon  see  that  the  robot  can  reach 
only points that lie on the line x + y = 0 and every other parallel of it. One way to describe 
this set of positions is to say that a point (x, y) belongs to it iff the sum x +  y is even.  We are 
now ready to prove the following theorem, which is stronger than the one we were asked 
to prove. 

Theorem.  The sum of the robot’s coordinates is always even. 
Proof.  The  proof  is  by  (simple)  induction  on  the  number  n  ∈  N  of  moves  made  by  the 
robot.  The  inductive hypothesis P (n) is  this:  after n moves,  the sum of  the robot’s coor­
dinates is even. 
Base case: We show that P (0) is true.  Indeed, after 0 steps, the robot is still at its birthpoint 
(0, 0), and the sum of its coordinates is 0 +  0  = 0, as required. 
Inductive step: We show that P (n) implies P (n +  1), for all n  ∈ N.  So, ﬁx any n  ∈ N and 
assume  that P (n) is  true;  that  is,  after  its nth move,  the  robot  is  at  a position  (x, y) such 
that x +  y is even. 
After the n+1st moves, the robot will have moved one step north or south (which changes 
its x­coordinate by 1) and one step east or west (which also changes its y­coordinate by 1). 
So, if (x� , y � ) is the new point, we have 
x�  =  x ± 1 

y �  =  y ± 1 

and 

so that the new sum of coordinates is 
x�  +  y �  = (x ± 1)  +  (y ± 1)  = (x +  y) +  [(±1)  +  (±1)] = (x +  y) +  d 
where  d  ∈  {−2, 0, +2}.  In  all  cases,  x�  +  y �  is  a  sum  of  two  even  numbers.  So,  P (n +  1) 
holds. 
Therefore, by induction, P (n) is true for all n ∈ N. The theorem holds. 

Now,  to prove  that  the  robot never  reaches point  (1, 0), we  just need  to observe  that  the 
sum 1 +  0   = 1   is not even.

4  Square Infection 

5 

The  following problem  is  fairly  tough until  you hear  a  certain  one­word  clue.  Then  the 
solution  is easy!  Suppose  that we have an n  × n  grid, where certain squares are  infected. 
Here is an example where n  = 6   and infected squares are marked ×.

× 

Now  the  infection  begins  to  spread  in  discrete  time  steps.  Two  squares  are  considered 
adjacent if they share an edge; thus, each square is adjacent to 2, 3 or 4 others. A square is 
infected in the next time step if either 

•  the square was previously infected, or 

•  the square is adjacent to at least two already­infected squares.

In the example, the infection spreads as shown below.

Over the next few time­steps, the entire grid becomes infected. 
Theorem.  An n  × n  grid  can  become  completely  infected  only  if  at  least n  squares  are  initially 
infected. 

Prove this theorem using induction and some additional reasoning.  If you are stuck, ask 
your recitation instructor for the one­word clue! 
Solution.  Deﬁne  the  perimeter  of  an  infected  region  to  be  the  number  of  edges  with 
infection on exactly one side. Let I  denote the perimeter of the initially­infected region. 

Proof.  We use induction on the number of time steps k  to prove that the perimeter of the 
infected region never increases.  The inductive hypothesis P (k) is this:  after k  time steps, 
the perimeter of the infected region is at most I . 

Recitation 5 

6 

Base case:  P (0) is true by deﬁnition; the perimeter of the infected region is at most I  after 
0 time steps, because I  is deﬁned to be the perimeter of the initially­infected region. 
Inductive  step:  We now  show  that P (k)  implies P (k  +  1)  for  all  k  ≥  0.  So,  ﬁx  any  k  ≥  0 
and assume that P (k)  is true;  that is, after k  steps,  the perimeter of the infected region is 
at most I . 
After step k + 1  the primeter can only change because some squares are newly infected. By 
the rules above, each newly­infected square is adjacent to at least two previously­infected 
squares.  Thus,  for each newly­infected  square,  at  least  two  edges are  removed  from  the 
perimenter  of  the  infected  region,  and  at  most  two  edges  are  added  to  the  perimeter. 
Therefore, the perimeter of the infected region can not increase and is at most I  after k + 1 
steps as well. Hence, P (k  +  1) is true. 
By induction, we conclude that P (k) is true for all nk  ≥ 0. 
Now,  if an n  × n  grid  is completely  infected,  then  the perimeter of  the  infected region  is 
4n.  Thus, the whole grid can become infected only if the perimeter is initially at least 4n. 
Since each square has perimeter 4, at least n  squares must be infected initially.
