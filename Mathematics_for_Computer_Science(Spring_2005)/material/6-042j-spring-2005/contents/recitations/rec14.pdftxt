Counting Rules 

Rule 1 (Generalized Product Rule).  Let S  be a set of length­k  sequences.  If there are: 

•  n1  possible ﬁrst entries, 

•  n2  possible second entries for each ﬁrst entry, 

•  n3  possible third entries for each combination of ﬁrst and second entries, etc. 

then:

S =  n1

A k­to­1 function maps exactly k  elements of the domain to every element of the range. 
For example, the function mapping each ear to its owner is 2­to­1: 

person A 

-
ear 1 
3

ear 2 
PPPPPP
 
q  person B 
ear 3 

Rule 2 (Division Rule).  If f  :  A  → B  is k ­to­1, then |A =  k B |.

The Generalized Product Rule 

2 

Problem 1.  Solve the following counting problems using the generalized product rule. 

(a)	 Next week,  I’m  going  to  get  really  ﬁt!  On day  1,  I’ll  exercise  for  5 minutes.  On 
each  subsequent day,  I’ll  exercise 0,  1,  2,  or 3 minutes more  than  the previous day. 
For example, the number of minutes that I exercise on the seven days of next week 
might be 5, 6, 9, 9, 9, 11, 12. How many such sequences are possible? 
Solution.  The  number  of  minutes  on  the  ﬁrst  day  can  be  selected  in  1  way.  The 
number  of minutes  on  each  subsequent  day  can  be  selected  in  4 ways.  Therefore, 
the number of exercise sequences is 1 · 46  by the extended product rule. 
(b)	 An  r­permutation  of  a  set  is  a  sequence  of  r  distinct  elements  of  that  set.  For 
example, here are all the 2­permutations of {a, b, c, d}: 

(a, b)  
(b, a)  
(c, a)  
(d, a) 

(a, c)  
(b, c)  
(c, b)  
(d, b) 

(a, d) 
(b, d) 
(c, d) 
(d, c) 

How many r­permutations of an n­element set are there?  Express your answer us­
ing factorial notation. 
Solution.  There  are  n  ways  to  choose  the  ﬁrst  element,  n − 1 ways  to  choose  the 
second, n − 2 ways to choose the third,  . . . , and there are n − r + 1 ways to choose 
the r­th element. Thus, there are: 

n · (n − 1) · (
n − r + 1)   =
n − 2) · · · (

n! 
(n − r)!  

r­permutations of an n­element set. 
(c)	 How many  n × n  matrices  are  there with  distinct  entries  drawn  from  {1, . . . , p}, 
where p ≥ n2? 
Solution. There are p ways to choose the ﬁrst entry, p − 1 ways to choose the second 
for each way of choosing the ﬁrst, p − 2 ways of choosing the third, and so forth.  In 
all there are 
p(p − 1)(p − 2) · · · (p − n 2  + 1) = 

p! 
(p − n2 )!  
such matrices.  Alternatively,  this  is  the  number  of  n2 ­permutations  of  a  p element 
set, which is p!/(p − n2 )!.

The Tao of BOOKKEEPPER

Problem 2.  In  this problem, we  seek enlightenment  through  contemplation of  the word 
BOOKKEEP ER. 

(a)  In how many ways can you arrange the letters in the word P OKE ? 
Solution.  There are 4!   arrangments corresponding to the 4!  permutations of the set 
{P, O, K, E }. 
(b)  In  how many ways  can  you  arrange  the  letters  in  the word BO1O2K ?  Observe 
that we have subscripted the O’s to make them distinct symbols.

Solution.  There are 4!   arrangments corresponding to the 4!  permutations of the set

{B , O1 , O2 , K }. 
(c)	 Suppose we map arrangements of the letters in BO1O2K  to arrangements of the 
letters  in BOOK  by erasing  the subscripts.  Indicate with arrows how  the arrange­
ments on the left are mapped to the arrangements on the right.

(d)	 What kind of mapping is this, young grasshopper?

Solution.  2­to­1


(e)	 In light of the Division Rule, how many arrangements are there of BOOK ? 
Solution.  4!/2  

(f)	 Very  good,  young  master!  How  many  arrangements  are  there  of  the  letters  in 
KE1E2P E3R? 
Solution.  6!  

(g)	 Suppose we map each arrangement of KE1E2P E3R to an arrangement of KEEP ER 
by  erasing  subscripts.  List  all  the  different  arrangements  of KE1E2P E3R  that  are 
mapped to REP EEK  in this way. 
Solution.  RE1P E2E3K ,  RE1P E3E2K ,  RE2P E1E3K ,  RE2P E3E1K ,  RE3P E1E2K , 
RE3P E2E1K 

(h)	 What kind of mapping is this? 

Solution.  3!­to­1

(i)	 So how many arrangements are there of the letters in KEEP ER?

Solution.  6!/3!


(j)  Now you are ready to face the BOOKKEEPER! 
How many arrangements of BO1O2K1K2E1E2P E3R  are there? 
Solution.  10! 

(k)	 How many arrangements of BOOK1K2E1E2P E3R  are there?

Solution.  10!/2!


(l)	 How many arrangements of BOOKKE1E2P E3R  are there?

Solution.  10!/(2!  · 2!)

(m)	 How many arrangements of BOOKKEEP ER  are there?

Solution.  10!/(2!  2!  · 3!)

· 
(n)	 How many arrangements of V OODOODOLL  are there?

Solution.  10!/(2!  2!  · 5!)

· 
(o)  (IMPORTANT)	 How many n­bit sequences contain k  zeros and (n  − k) ones? 
�	 � 
Solution.  n!/(k !  · (n  − k)!) 
This quantity is denoted  n
k and read “n  choose k”. You will see it almost every day 
in 6.042 from now until the end of the term. 

Remember well what you have learned:  subscripts on, subscripts off. 
This is the Tao of Bookkeeper.

Problem 3.  Solve the following counting problems.  Deﬁne an appropriate mapping (bi­
jective or k ­to­1) between a set whose size you know and the set in question. 

(a)  (IMPORTANT)	 In how many ways can k elements be chosen from an n­element 
set {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn}? 
�  � 
Solution.  There  is  a  bijection  from  n­bit  sequences  with  k  ones.  The  sequence 
(b1 , . . . , bn )  maps  to  the  subset  that  contains  xi  if  and  only  if  bi  = 1.  Therefore,  the 
n
.k 
number of such subsets is 
(b)	 How many different ways are there to select a dozen donuts if four varieties are 
available? 
Solution.  There is a bijection from selections of a dozen donuts to 15­bit sequences 
with  exactly  3 ones.  In particular,  suppose  that  the varieties  are glazed,  chocolate, 
lemon,  and Boston creme.  Then a selection of g glazed,  c chocolate,  l lemon,  and b 
Boston creme maps to the sequence: 
(g 0�s) 1  (c 0�s) 1  (l 0�s) 1  (b 0�s) 
�  � 
Therefore, the number of selections is equal to the number of 15­bit sequences with 
exactly 3 ones, which is: 
15

15!  
3!  12!

(c)	 How many paths are there from (0, 0)  to (10, 20) consisting of right­steps (which 
increment  the  ﬁrst  coordinate)  and  up­steps  (which  increment  the  second  coordi­
nate)? 
� � 
Solution.  There is a bijection from 30­bit sequences with 10 zeros and 20 ones.  The 
sequence  (b1 , . . . , b30 )  maps  to a path where  the  i­th  step  is  right  if  bi  = 0  and up  if 
bi  = 1. Therefore, the number of paths is equal to  30  .
10 
(d)	 An independent living group is hosting eight pre­frosh, affectionately known at 
P1 , . . . , P8  by the permanent residents. Each pre­frosh must must be assigned a task: 
2  must  wash  pots,  2  must  clean  the  kitchen,  1  must  clean  the  bathrooms,  1  must 
clean the common area, and 2 must serve dinner.  In how many ways can P1 , . . . , P8 
be put to productive use? 
Solution. There is a bijection from sequences containing two P ’s, two K ’s, a B , a C , 
and  two D’s.  In particular,  the  sequence  (t1 , . . . , t8 )  corresponds  to  assigning Pi  to 
washing pots if ti  =  P , to cleaning the kitchen if ti  =  K , to cleaning the bathrooms 
if ti  =  B , etc. Therefore, the number of possible assignments is: 

8!

2!  2!  1!  1!   2!

(e)	 In how many ways can Mr. and Mrs. Grumperson distribute 13 indistinguishable 
pieces of coal to their two— no, three!— children for Christmas? 
� � 
Solution.  There  is  a  bijection  from  15­bit  strings with  two  ones.  In  particular,  the 
bit string 0a10b10c  maps to the assignment of a coals to the ﬁrst child, b coals to the 
second, and c coals to the third. Therefore, there are  15  assignments.

(f)  How many solutions over the natural numbers are there to the equation: 

x1  +  x2  +  . . . +  x10 

≤ 

100 

�
� 
Solution.  There  is  a  bijection  from  110­bit  sequences with  10  ones  to  solutions  to 
this equation.  In particular, xi  is the number of zeros before the i­th one but after the 
(i − 1)­st one (or the beginning of the sequence). Therefore, there are  110  solutions.
10 
(g)	 (Quiz 2, Fall ’03) Suppose that two identical 52­card decks of are mixed together. 
In how many ways can the cards in this double­size deck be arranged? 
Solution.  The  number  of  sequences  of  the  104  cards  containing  2  of  each  card  is 
104!/(2!)52  .
