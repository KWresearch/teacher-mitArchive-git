Problem 1.  Learning to count takes practice! 

(a)	 In how many different ways can Blockbuster arrange 64 copies of 13 conversations 
about one thing, 96 copies of L’Auberge Espagnole and 1 copy of Matrix Revolutions on 
a shelf? What if they are to be arranged in 5 shelves? 
Solution.  For 1 shelf, this is the number of ways to arrange 64 C ’s, 96 A’s, and 1 M . 
By the bookeeper rule: 

(64 + 96 + 1)! 
64! 96! 1! 
For  5  shelves,  we  can  do  the  simple  trick  of  introducing  the  dividers  between  the 
shelves as new objects.  That  is, we want  the number of ways  to arrange 64 C ’s, 96 
A’s, 1 M , and 4 X ’s (dividers). By the bookeeper theorem, again: 

(64 + 96 + 1 + 4)! 
64! 96! 1! 4!

(b)  Find the number of 5­card hands with exactly three aces. 
Solution. We can choose the three aces in  4  ways, and we can choose the remain­
4 
ing two cards in  48  ways. Thus, there are 
48
such hands.

(c)  Find the number of 5­card hands in which every suit appears at most twice.

Solution. There are two cases. Either one suit appears twice or else two suits appear

twice. The number of hands in which one suit appears twice is  13  133  4, since there

are  4 ways  to  choose  the  doubly­represented  suit,  13  ways  to  choose  two  values

from this suit, and 133  ways to choose values for cards in the three remaining suits.

Similarly, the number of hands in which two suits appear twice is  13

such hands. 

(d)	 In how many ways can 20 indistinguishable pre­frosh be stored in four different 
crates if each crate must contain an even number of pre­frosh? 
Solution.  There  is a bijection  from 13­bit strings with exactly 3 ones.  In particular, 
the string 0a10b10c10d  corresponds to to storing 2a prefrosh in the ﬁrst crate, 2b in the 

2 

Recitation 15 
� � 
second, 2c in the third, and 2d in the fourth.  Therefore, the number of ways to store 
the pre­frosh  is  equal  to  the number  of  13­bit  strings with  exactly  3  ones, which  is 
13  .3 
(e)	 How many  paths  are  there  from  point  (0, 0)  to  (50, 50)  if  every  step  increments 
�

one coordinate and  leaves  the other unchanged and  there are  impassable boulders 
� � � � 
sitting at points (10, 10) and (20, 20)?

Solution.  We  use  inclusion­exclusion.  The  total  number  of  paths  is  100  ,  but  we 
50 
10  ·  40 
� �  � � 
must  subtract  off  the  obstructed paths.  There  are  20 
80
paths  through  the ﬁrst 
boulder, since there are  10  paths from the start to the boulder and  80  paths from 
20

the  boulder  to  the  ﬁnish.  Similarly,  there  are  40 
60
paths  through  the  second

boulder.  However,  we  must  subtract  off  paths  going  through  both  boulders,  and

there are  20

(f)  In how many ways can the 72 students in 6.042 be divided into 18 groups of 4? 
Solution.  There  is a 18!­to­1 mapping from sequences containing four 1’s,  four 2’s, 
. . . ,  and  four  18’s.  Speciﬁcally,  the  sequence  (t1 , . . . , t72 )  corresponds  to  the  assign­
ment where  each  student  i  is placed  in  group  ti .  The mapping  is  18!­to­1,  because 
we can permute the team numbers (in 18! different ways) without altering the way 
the class is partitioned. Therefore, the number we want is 

72! 
(4!)1818! 

by the bookeeper rule and the division rule. 

(g)	 Set A  has  r  elements  and  set B  has  n  elements.  How many  functions  are  there 
from A to B ? How many of them are injective (one­to­one)? How many of them are 
bijective? 
Solution.  Say A =  {a1 , . . . , ar } and B  =  {b1 , . . . , bn} and consider the mapping that 
→
sends every function f  : A
B to the sequence (f (a1 ), . . . , f (ar )). This is a bijection 
between  functions  from  A  to  B  and  r­long  sequences  of  elements  from  B .  By  the 
product rule, the number of such sequences is 
n · ��  �
� 
n · · ·
r 
n = n .
r times 
For  injections, ﬁrst note  that  (by  the pigeonhole principle)  there  is no way  to  inject 
A  into  B  if  B  has  fewer  elements  than  A.  That  is:  if  r  >  n,  then  the  number  of 
injections  from  A  to  B  is  0.  If  r  ≤  n,  though,  the  same  mapping  as  previously 

Recitation 15

becomes a bijection between injections from A to B  and r­long sequences of distinct 
elements from B . By the generalized product rule, the number of such sequences is 

n · (n − 1) · (n − 2) · · · (n − r + 1) = 

n! 
, 
(n − r)! 

that is, the number of r­permutations of n elements. 
For bijections, we similarly note that in the case r =� n the number of bijections from 
A to B  is 0.  If r = n, then a function from A to B  is a bijection iff it is an injection.  So 
the number of bijections equals the number of injections:  n!/(n − n)! = n!, which is 
exactly the number of different permutations of n elements. 
Notice how  functions,  injections,  and  bijections  correspond  respectively  to  sequences, 
r­permutations, and permutations. 

Problem 2.  A pizza house is having a promotional sale. Their commercial reads: 

We offer 9 different toppings for your pizza!  Buy 3 large pizzas at the regular 
price,  and  you  can  order  each  one  with  any  combination  of  toppings  abso­
lutely free. That’s 22, 369, 621 different ways to design your order! 

The ad writer was a former Harvard student who had evaluated the formula (29 )3/3! on 
her calculator and gotten close to 22, 369, 621.  Unfortunately, (29 )3/3! is obviously not an 
integer, so clearly something is wrong. What?  In particular, did she overcount or did she 
undercount? What is the correct number? 
Solution. The number of ways to choose different toppings for one pizza is the number 
of the possible subsets of the set of 9 toppings, namely, 29 . The ad writer presumably then 
ﬁgured out that there were (29 )3  ways to place a sequence of three pizza orders.  Then she 
probably  reasoned  that each  set of  three orders arises  from 3! sequences,  so  the Division 
Rule would imply that the number of orders is (29 )3/3!. 
It’s  true  that  every  set  of  three  different  orders  arises  from  3!  different  sequences  of 
three  orders.  The  bug  is  that  if  some  of  the  three  orders  are  the  same,  then  the  set  of 
three  orders  arises  from  fewer  than  3!  sequences.  For  example,  if  all  three  pizzas  have 
the same  toppings,  there  is only one sequence of orders  for  them.  So dividing by 3! will 
undercount. 
We  really need  to  count  the number of ways  to “throw”  three  indistinguishable balls 
(the  three  orders)  into  29  distinguishable  bins  (the different  toppings).  Hence,  there  is  a 
� 
�  � 
� 
bijection to the number of (29  + 2)­bit strings with exactly 29  − 1 ones and 3 zeros: 
29  + 2 
29  + 2 
= 
29  − 1

Combinatorial proofs of identities 
Recall the basic plan for a combinatorial proof of an identity x = y : 

1.  Deﬁne a set S . 
2.  Show that |S | = x by counting one way. 
3.  Show that |S | = y by counting another way. 
4.  Conclude that x = y . 

Problem  3.  You  want  to  choose  a  team  of  m  people  from  a  pool  of  n  people  for  your 
startup company, and from these m people you want to choose k to be the team managers.

Before  doing  the  reasonable  thing —dump  on  your CFO  or Harvard  Business  School— 
you decide to check his answer against yours.

(b)  Now give a combinatorial argument proving this same fact. 
�  ��

Solution.  Instead  of  choosing  ﬁrst m  from  n  and  then  k  from m,  you  could  alter­
nately choose the k managers from the n people and then choose m − k people to ﬁll 
n − k 
out  the  team  from  the remaining n − k  people.  This gives you

(a)	 Start  with  a  combinatorial  argument.  Hint:  let  S  be  the  set  of  all  sequences  in 
{0, 1, ∗} n 
containing exactly one ∗.
Solution.	 Let S  be the set of all sequences in {0, 1, ∗}  containing exactly one ∗.

On one hand,  |S |  =  n2n−1 ,  since  the ∗  can appear  in n positions and  there are 2n−1 
settings for the remaining symbols.

On  the other hand,  every  sequence  in S  contains between  1  and n nonzero  entries 
since the ∗, at least, is nonzero. The number of sequences in S with exactly k nonzero

, since there are  k  ways to select the positions of the nonzero entries

and then k ways to select one of those entries to be the ∗. Thus, by the Sum Rule:

Equating these two expressions for |S | proves the theorem.

The ﬁrst  three  steps are algebra:  replacing  the binomial coefﬁcient with  its  ratio of 
factorials,  then simplifying k ,  then  trying  to  form another coefﬁcient by drawing n 
out of n!  (and  eventually out of  the  sum).  In  the  fourth  step, we  change variables, 
from k to j  = k − 1.  In the ﬁfth step, we recognize the new coefﬁcient we were after. 
The ﬁnal step uses the binomial theorem.
