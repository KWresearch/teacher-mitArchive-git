Sum and Product Rules 

Problem 1.  A license plate consists of either: 

•  3 letters followed by 3 digits (standard plate) 

•  5 letters (vanity plate)


Let L be the set of all possible license plates.


(a)  Express L in terms of 

A =  {A, B , C, . . . , Z } 
D =  {0, 1, 2, . . . , 9}

Bijections 

Problem 2.  For each part below, describe a bijection between the two sets mentioned. The 
existence of such a bijection proves that the two sets are the same size. 
A  good  approach  is  to  describe  an  element  of  the  ﬁrst  set  using  variables  and  then 
describe  the  corresponding  element  of  the  second  set  in  terms  of  those  variables.  For 
example,  we might  describe  a  bijecton  from ways  of  selecting  a  dozen  doughnuts  from 
ﬁve varieties to a 16­bit string with four 1’s as follows:

(a)	 Describe a bijection between the set of 30­bit sequences with 10 zeros and 20 ones 
and paths  from  (0, 0)  to  (10, 20)   consisting of  right­steps  (which  increment  the ﬁrst 
coordinate) and up­steps (which increment the second coordinate). 
Solution. Map the 30­bit sequence b1 b2  . . . b30  to a path where the i­th step is right if 
bi  = 0  and up if bi  = 1. 

(b)	 Find  a  bijection  between  the  set  of  n­bit  sequences  and  the  set  of  all  subsets  of 
{x1 , x2 , . . . , xn}. 
Solution. Map the n­bit sequence b1 b2  . . . bn  to a subset that contains xi  if and only if 
bi  = 1. 

(c)	 Mr.  and Mrs. Grumperson have collected 13 identical pieces of coal as Christmas 
presents  for  their  beloved  children,  Lucy  and  Spud.  Describe  a  bijection  between 
the set of all ways of distributing  the 13 coal pieces  to  the  two children and  the set 
of 14­bit sequences with exactly 1 one. 
Solution. Map a distribution in which Lucy get l pieces and Spud gets s pieces to a 
14­bit sequence with l zeros, a one, and then s zeros. 

(d)	 On Christmas Eve, Mr.  and Mrs.  Grumperson remember  that  they have a  third 
child,  little Bottlecap,  locked  in  the attic.  Describe a bijection between  the set of all 
ways  of  distributing  the  13  coal  pieces  to  the  three  children  and  the  set  of  15­bit 
sequences with exactly 2 ones. 
Solution.  Map  a  distribution  in which  Lucy  gets  l pieces,  Spud  gets  s  pieces,  and 
Bottlecap gets b pieces to a 15­bit sequence with l zeros, a one, s zeros, a one, and b 
zeros. 

(e)	 On reﬂection, Mr.  and Mrs.  Grumperson decide that each of their three children 
should receive at least two pieces of coal for Christmas. Describe a bijection between 
the set of all ways of distributing the 13 coal pieces to the three Grumperson children 
given this constraint and the set of 9­bit sequences with exactly 2 ones. 
Solution.  Map  a  distribution  in  which  Lucy  gets  l  ≥  2  pieces,  Spud  gets  s  ≥  2 
pieces, and Bottlecap gets b ≥ 2  pieces to a 9­bit sequence with exactly l − 2  zeros, a 
one, s − 2  zeros, a one, and b − 2  zeros.

(f)	 Describe a bijection between the set of 110­bit sequences with exactly 10 ones and 
solutions over the natural numbers to the equation: 

x1  +  x2  +  · · · +  x10  ≤  100 

Solution.  Let  x1  be  the  number  of  zeros  before  the  ﬁrst  1,  x2 ,  be  the  number  of 
zeros  between  the  ﬁrst  and  second  1,  etc.  Note  that  zeros  after  the  tenth  1  do  not 
contribute  to  the  value  of  any  of  the  variables  x1 , . . . , x10 ;  this  allows  us  to  count 
solutions to the inequality (≤ 100) rather than the equality (=  100). 
(g)	 Describe a bijection between solutions to the inequality in the preceding problem 
part and sequences (y1 , y2 , . . . , y10 ) such that: 
0  ≤ y1  ≤ y2  ≤  · · · ≤ y10  ≤ 100 

Solution. Let yi  =  x1  +

· · ·

+  xi  for each i from 1 to 10. 

Pigeonhole Principle 

Problem 3.  Solve the following problems using the pigeonhole principle.  For each prob­
lem,  try  to  identify  the  pigeons,  the  pigeonholes,  and  a  rule  assigning  each pigeon  to  a pi­
geonhole. 

(a)  In a room of 500 people, there exist two who share a birthday. 
Solution.  The pigeons are  the 500 people.  The pigeonholes are 366 possible birth­
days.  Map each person  to his or her own birthday.  Since  there 500 people and 366 
birthdays, some two people must have the same birthday by the Pigeonhole Princi­
ple. 

(b)	 Every  MIT  ID  number  starts  with  a  9  (we  think).  Suppose  that  each  of  the  75 
students  in  6.042  sums  the  nine  digits  of  his  or  her  ID  number.  Must  two  people 
arrive at the same sum? 
Solution. Yes.  The students are the pigeons, the possible sums are the pigeonholes, 
and  we  map  each  student  to  the  sum  of  the  digits  in  his  or  her  MIT  ID  number. 
·	
·
Every sum is in the range from 9 +  8 0  = 9  to 9 +  8  9  = 81, which means that there 
are  73 pigeonholes.  Since  there  are more pigeons  than pigeonholes,  there must  be 
two  pigeons  in  the  same  pigeonhole;  in  other  words,  there  must  be  two  students 
with the same sum.

(c)	 In every set of 100 integers, there exist two whose difference is a multiple of 37. 
Solution.  The pigeons  are  the  100  integers.  The pigeonholes  are  the numbers  0  to 
36. Map integer k to k  rem  37.  Since there are 100 pigeons and only 37 pigeonholes, 
two  pigeons must  go  in  the  same  pigeonhole.  This means  k1  rem 37  =  k2  rem  37, 
which implies that k1  − k2  is a multiple of 37. 
.√
(d)  For any ﬁve points in a unit square, there are two points at distance less than 
1
2 
Solution.  The  pigeons  are  the  points.  The  pigeonholes  are  the  four  subsquares  of 
the unit square, each of side length  1 
2 .  There are ﬁve pigeons and four pigeonholes, 
so more than one point must be in the same subsquare. Points in the same subsquare 
are at distance at most  √
2  . 
1
(e)	 For any ﬁve points in an equilateral triangle of side length 2, there are two points 
at distance less than 1. 
Solution.  The pigeons are the points.  The pigeonholes are the four sub­equilateral 
triangles  of  side  length  1.  There  are  ﬁve  pigeons  and  four  pigeonholes,  so  more 
than  one  point  must  be  in  the  same  sub­equilateral  triangle.  Points  in  the  same 
sub­equilateral triangle are at distance at most 1. 
(f)	 Let {a1 , . . . , a201} be a set of natural numbers less than 300. Then there are i, j such 
that  ai  = 3k  for some k > 0. 
aj 
Solution.  The pigeons are the numbers.  The pigeonholes are the 200 numbers  less 
· 
than 300  that are not divisible by 3.  Write each number ai  = 3ci 
bi , where bi  is not 
divisible by 3. Place ai  in the pigeonhole bi . Then there are two numbers ai , aj  placed 
= 3ci−cj .  (Assume ci  >  cj  without  loss of 
ai
in  the same pigeonhole,  i.e.  bi  =  bj ,  so  aj 
generality)
