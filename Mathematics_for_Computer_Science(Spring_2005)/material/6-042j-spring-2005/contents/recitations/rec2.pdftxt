1  Case Analysis 

The proof  of  a  statement  can  sometimes  be  broken down  into  several  cases, which  then 
can be tackled individually. 

1.1  The Method 

In order to prove a proposition P  using case analysis: 

•	 Write, “We use case analysis.” 

•	 Identify  a  sequence  of  conditions,  at  least  one  of  which  must  hold.  (If  this  is  not 
obvious, you must prove it.) 

•	 For each condition: 

–	 State the condition. 
–	 Prove P  assuming that the condition holds. 

Often case­analysis arguments extend to several  levels.  The most difﬁcult challenge  in a 
case­analysis argument is try to decide how to break up the problem.  The most common 
error is failing to construct a complete set of cases. 

1.2  Example 

Theorem 1.  There exist irrational numbers p  and q  such that p  raised to the power q  is rational. 

This is an ingenious proof, not the sort of thing one would think up in a few minutes.

Proof.  We use case analysis. Let v  =

Recitation 2 
Team Problem: An Indirect Proof 

Here is the format of an indirect proof of a proposition P . 

1.  “We use proof by contradiction.” 

2.  “Suppose P  is false.” 

3.  Show this implies some sort of contradiction. 

4.  “This is a contradiction. Therefore, P  is true.” 

Give an indirect proof of the following theorem. 

Theorem 2.  log5  8  is irrational. 

Solution.  We use proof by contradiction.  Suppose  that  log5  8  is  rational.  Then  there 
exist integers a   and b  such that: 

This implies that: 

log5  8 = 

a 
b 

8  = 5a/b 
8b  = 5a 

(Raising  the  ﬁrst  equation  to  the  b­th  power  gives  the  second.)  Now  the  left  side  of  the 
last equation is even and the right side is odd.  This is a contradiction.  Therefore, log5  8  is 
irrational.

Team Problem: A Case Analysis 

4 

Four  castaways must  escape  from  an  island  to  the mainland  on  a makeshift  raft.  Their 
weights  are  5,  10,  20,  and  25.  The  raft  can  hold  at  most  two  people.  The  number  of 
minutes required  to paddle  the raft between  the  island and  the mainland  is equal  to  the 
weight  of  the  heaviest  passenger  aboard.  For  example,  if  10  and  25  cross  together,  25 
minutes are used.  If 10 then returns alone, another 10 minutes are used. 

Claim 3.  It takes at least 65 minutes for all four castaways to escape. 

Proof.  At least three trips and two return trips are required.  Since the lightest person has 
· 
weight 5, a minimum of 2 5   = 10  minutes are required for the two return trips. The three 
forward trips then require a total of 55 minutes:  10 minutes for 5 and 10, 20 minutes for 5 
and 20, and 25 minutes for 5 and 25.  Therefore, the total time for all four people to cross 
× 
is at least 10 + 55 = 65 minutes as claimed. 

(a)	 Where is the error in this argument? 
Solution. The “proof ” considers only the possibility that person 5 shuttles everyone 
else to shore. 

(b)	 Find a way to get everyone to shore in 60 minutes. 

Solution.


•  5 and 10 cross 
•  5 returns 
•  20 and 25 cross 
•  10 returns 
•  5 and 10 cross

(c)  Flesh­out the case­analysis proof of the following theorem: 

Theorem 4.  The four castaways can not escape in 55 or fewer minutes. 

Speciﬁcally,  explain why  there  is  no way  for  the  four  castaways  to  escape  in  55  or 
fewer minutes in each case. 

Proof.  We use case analysis. We ﬁrst consider the total number of boat trips. 

•	 Case 1. There are an even number of trips. 
Solution. Then the boat ends up on the island. Whoever brought it over last is 
stuck there. 
•	 Case 2. There are three or fewer trips. 

Solution. Then at most three people can escape the island.

•	 Case 3. There are seven or more trips. 
Solution.  At  least  one  trip  takes  25  minutes.  This  trip  excludes  either  20  or 
10, so another trip takes at least 10 minutes.  The remaining trips take at least 5 
minutes each.  So the total time is at least 25 + 10 + 5 · 5 =  60 minutes. 
•  Case 4. There exactly ﬁve trips. Now we consider trips involving 20 and 25. 
–	 Case A. Multiple trips involve either 20 or 25. 
Solution.  Then  there  is  at  least  one  25  minute  trip  and  at  least  one  20 
minute trip.  The remaining trips require at least 5 minutes each for a total 
of 25 + 20 + 3 · 5 =  60 minutes. 
–	 Case B. No trips involve either 20 or 25.

Solution. Then they are stuck on the island.

–	 Case C.  Exactly  one  trip  involves  both  20  and  25.  We  now  consider  trips 
involving person 10. 
*	 Case i. An even number of trips involve 10. 
Solution. Then 10 ends up on the island. 
*	 Case ii. Exactly one trip involves 10. 
Solution.  This  implies  that 5  is  the only passenger on one  trip off  the 
island.  Thus,  there are at most ﬁve departures from the  island.  Some­
one must  be  in  the  boat  for  both  trips  back  to  the  island,  so  there  are 
at  least  two  returns.  But  that means  that  someone  is  left  stuck  on  the 
island. 
*	 Case iii. Three or more trips involve 10. 
Solution. Then the total time for all four castaways to escape is at least 
25 + 3 · 10 + 5 =  60.
