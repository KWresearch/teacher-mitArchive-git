The Law of Total Probability is a handy tool for breaking down the computation of a prob­
ability into distinct cases.  More precisely, suppose we are interested in the probability of 
an event E : Pr  (E ).  Suppose also that the random experiment can evolve in two different 
�  � 
ways; that is, two different cases X and X are possible.  Suppose also that 
� 
� 
•  it is easy to ﬁnd the probability of each case: Pr  (X ) and Pr   X 
, 
•  it easy to ﬁnd the probability of the event in each case: Pr  (E | X ) and Pr   E X 
| 
.
Then ﬁnding the probability of E is only two multiplications and an addition away. 
�  � 
� 
� 
Theorem 1 (Law of Total Probability).  Let E and X be events, and 0  < Pr  (X ) < 1. Then 
Pr  (E )  =  Pr  (X ) · Pr  (E | X ) +  Pr   X  Pr  E | X
· 
� 
�  � 
� 
Proof.  Let’s simplify the right­hand side. 
� 
�
Pr  (E | X ) · Pr  (X ) +  Pr   E X  Pr  X
· 
|
� � 
Pr  E ∩ X 
Pr  (E ∩ X )  · Pr  (X ) + 
� 
� 
= 
Pr  (X ) 
Pr  X 
= Pr   (E ∩ X ) +  Pr  E ∩ X 
= Pr  (E ) 

Pr  � 
· 
X 

� 

The ﬁrst step uses the deﬁnition of conditional probability. On the next­to­last line, we’re 
adding the probabilities of all outcomes in E and X to the probabilities of all outcomes in 
E and not in X .  Since every outcome in E is either in X or not in X , this is the sum of the 
probabilities of all outcomes in E , which equals Pr   (E ). 

What  happens  if  the  experiment  can  evolve  in  more  than  two  different  ways?  That  is, 
what if there are n cases, X1 , . . . , Xn , which are mutually exclusive (no two cases can hap­
pen simultaneously) and collectively exhaustive (at least one case must happen)?  If it is still 
easy  to ﬁnd  the probability  of  each  case and  the probability of  the  event  in  each  case,  then 
again ﬁnding Pr   (E ) is trivial. 
Theorem  2.  Let E  be  an  event  and  let X1 , . . . , Xn  be  disjoint  events whose union  exhausts  the

sample space. Then

Problem 1.  There is a rare and deadly disease called Nerditosis which afﬂicts about 1 per­
son in 1000. On symption is a compulsion to refer to everything— ﬁelds of study, classes, 
buildings,  etc.—  using  numbers.  It’s  horrible.  As  victims  enter  their  ﬁnal,  downward 
spiral,  they’re  awarded  a  degree  from  MIT.  Two  doctors  claim  that  they  can  diagnose 
Nerditosis. 

(a)	 Doctor X  received his degree  from Harvard Medical  School.  He practices  at Mas­
sachusetts General Hospital and has access  to  the  latest scanners,  lab  tests,  and  re­
search.  Suppose you ask Doctor X  whether you have the disease. 

•  If you have Nerditosis, he says “yes” with probability 0.99. 
•  If you don’t have it, he says “no” with probability 0.97. 

Let D  be  the event  that you have  the disease,  and  let E  be  the event  that  the diag­
nosis is erroneous. Use the Total Probability Law to compute Pr  (E ), the probability 
that Doctor X  makes a mistake. 
� 
�  � 
� 
Solution. By the Total Probability Law: 
Pr  (E )  = Pr  (E  | D) · Pr  (D) +  Pr  E D  Pr  D
· 
|
= 0.01   · 0.001  +  0.03  · 0.999 
= 0.02998 

(b)	 “Doctor ” Y  received his genuine degree from a fully­accredited university for $49.95 
via a special internet offer.  He knows that Nerditosis stikes 1 person in 1000, but is 
a  little  shakey  on  how  to  interpret  this.  So  if  you  ask  him  whether  you  have  the 
disease,  he’ll  helpfully  say  “yes” with  probability  1  in  1000  regardless  of whether 
you actually do or not. 
Let D  be  the event  that you have  the disease,  and  let F  be  the event  that  the diag­
nosis is faulty. Use the Total Probability Law to compute Pr  (F ), the probability that 
Doctor Y  made a mistake. 
� 
�  � 
� 
Solution. By the Total Probability Law: 
Pr  (F )  = Pr  (F D) · Pr  (D) +  Pr  F  | D  Pr  D
· 
|	
= 0.999  · 0.001  +  0.001  · 0.999 
= 0.001998 

(c)	 Which doctor is more reliable?

Solution. Doctor X  makes more than 15 times as many errors as Doctor Y  .

Problem 2.  A Barglesnort makes its lair in one of three caves: 

2 , cave 2 with probability  1 , and cave 3 
The Barglesnort  inhabits cave 1 with probability  1 
4
with probability  1  .  A  rabbit  subsequently moves  into one of  the  two unoccupied  caves, 
4
selected with equal probability. With probability  1 , the rabbit leaves tracks at the entrance 
3
to its cave.  (Barglesnorts are much too clever to leave tracks.) What is the probability that 
the Barglesnort lives in cave 3, given that there are no tracks in front of cave 2? 
Use a tree diagram and the four­step method. 

Solution.  A  tree  diagram  is  given  below.  Let  B3  be  the  event  that  the  Barglesnort 
inhabits cave 3, and let T2  be the event that there are tracks in front of cave 2. Taking data

Problem 3.  There is a deck of cards on the table.  Either John or Mary shufﬂed it and we 
have  no  reason  to  believe  in  one  case more  than  the  other.  Now,  John  is  a well­known 
cheater with well­known preferences:  he  always  steals  the  ace  of diamonds while  shuf­
ﬂing. Mary, on the other hand, is a very honest girl:  a deck sufﬂed by her is always a full 
52­card deck. 

(a)	 You pick the topmost card on the deck and you see a queen of hearts. Before you 
do any calculations: Who is more likely to have shufﬂed the deck? Explain. 
Solution.  A shufﬂing by John strictly increases the fraction of non­aces in the deck. 
Hence, between the two worlds: 

(1)  the world where John has shufﬂed the deck and 
(2)  the world where Mary has shufﬂed the deck 

it  is  the ﬁrst world rather  than  the second one  that  favors  the event of  the  topmost 
card  being  a  non­ace.  Since  we  know  this  event  is  a  fact  and  the  two  worlds  are 
otherwise equally likely, we should bet we live in world (1). 

(b)	 Now calculate.  What is the probability that John has shufﬂed the deck?  What is 
the probability that it has been Mary? 
Solution. Let J  be the event that John shufﬂes the deck and A  that the topmost card 
� 
� 
�	
� 
is an ace. We want the probabilities 
� 
� 
� 
� 
� 
� 
Pr  J  | A 
Pr  M  | A 
and 
Clearly,  M  =  J  and  therefore  Pr  M  | A  =  Pr  J  | A  = 1  −  Pr  J A  ,  so  that 
|
we need only calculate  the probability about John.  By  the deﬁnition of conditional 
probability  (ﬁrst  equation)  and  then  the  product  rule  (on  the  enumerator)  and  the

Like John, Peter is also a well­known cheater:  when he shufﬂes the deck, he also steals a 
card from it; but (unlike John) he steals a random card. That is, every card is equally likely 
to be stolen when Peter is shufﬂing.

(c)  Suppose  you  know  that  Mary  shufﬂed  the  deck  and  you  are  about  to  pick  the 
topmost card. What is the probability that you will see an ace?

Solution.  If we  know Mary  shufﬂed  the  deck,  we  know  the  deck  if  a  full  52­card

.52 
deck.  So, easily, the probability is 
4
(d)	 Suppose  you  know  that  Peter  shufﬂed  the  deck  and  you  are  about  to  pick  the 
topmost card.  What  is  the probability  that you will see an ace?  (Hint:  What  is  this 
probability if Peter steals an ace? What if Peter steals a non­ace?) 
Solution.  Suppose  Peter  shufﬂes  the  deck.  Then  there  are  two  cases  about what 
� 
� 
card he  steals:  it’s  either  an  ace or  a non­ace.  Let SA  be  the  event  that he  steals  an 
ace.  Since  he  steals  a  card  at  random,  we  know  he  steals  an  ace  with  probability 
4	
.52 
Pr  (SA ) =  52   and a non­ace with probability Pr   SA  = 
48
Now, as before, let A  be the event that the topmost card is an ace.  If we know what 
�
� 
case we are  in with  respect  to  the  stolen  card,  it  is easy  to  calculate  the probability 
of A: 
3	
Pr  A  | SA  = 
Pr  (A  | SA ) = 
4 
and 
51	
51 
So,  we  know  the  probability  in  each  case  and  we  also  know  the  probability  of  each 
� 
� 
� 
� 
case. This rings the bell of the law of total probability: 
Pr  (A)  = Pr  (SA ) · Pr  (A  | SA ) +   Pr  SA  Pr  A  | SA  =  52  ·  51  +  48 
52  ·  51

So the probability that the topmost card is an ace is 
.52 
4
(e)	 Anything strange with the answers to parts (c) and (d)? 
Solution.  The two answers are identical.  In other words, whether the deck is miss­
ing a card or not does not affect the probability that the topmost card is an ace! How 
can that be? 
Here is an explanation. The situation of part (c) is identical to the following: 

4·(3+48)  =  4
52·51 
52

= 

.

we pick the top two cards of a well­shufﬂed 52­card deck; 
what is the probability that the ﬁrst card is an ace? 

(because  the  selection  of  the  second  card  is  irrelevant).  Similarly,  the  situation  of 
part (d) is identical to the following: 

we pick the top two cards of a well­shufﬂed 52­card deck; 
what is the probability that the second card is an ace? 

(because  the  effect  of  Peter  stealing  a  card  at  random  and  shufﬂing  is  identical  to 
the  effect  of  us  drawing  the  topmost  card).  Now  the  two  situations  we  have  just 
introduced are identical, because the number of pairs where the ﬁrst card is an ace 
is equal to the number of pairs where the second card is an ace, for obvious reasons 
of symmetry.
