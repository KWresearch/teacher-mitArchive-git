The ﬁrst step uses the assumption P (n) and the second is simpliﬁcation. 
Thus, P (2)  is  true and P (n)  implies P (n +  1)  for all n  ≥  2.  Therefore, P (n)  is  true for 
all n ≥ 2  by the principle of induction. 
Problem 2.  DeMorgan’s Law for sets says: 
A ∩ (B ∪ C ) = (A ∩ B ) ∪ (A ∩ C ) 
Assume this and prove this extension of DeMorgan’s Law to n ≥ 2  sets: 
A ∩ (B1  ∪ B2  ∪ . . . ∪ Bn ) = (A ∩ B1 ) ∪ (A ∩ B2 ) ∪ . . . ∪ (A ∩ Bn ) 

Extending formulas  to an arbitrary number of  terms  is a common (if mundane) applica­
tion of induction.

Problem Set 2 

Solution. We use induction. Let P (n) be the proposition that 
A ∩ (B1  ∪ B2  ∪ . . . ∪ Bn ) = (A ∩ B1 ) ∪ (A ∩ B2 ) ∪ . . . ∪ (A ∩ Bn ) 
for all sets A and B1 , . . . , Bn . 
Base case: P (2) follows from DeMorgan’s original law with B =  B1  and C =  B2 . 
Inductive step: Assuming P (n), we can deduce P (n +  1) as follows: 
A ∩ (B1  ∪ B2  ∪ B3  ∪ . . . ∪ Bn ) =  A ∩ ((B1  ∪ B2 ) ∪ B3  ∪ . . . ∪ Bn ) 
= (A ∩ (B1  ∪ B2 ))   ∪ (A ∩ B3 ) ∪ . . . ∪ (A ∩ Bn ) 
= (A ∩ B1 ) ∪ (A ∩ B2 ))   ∪ (A ∩ B3 ) ∪ . . . ∪ (A ∩ Bn ) 
In the ﬁrst step, we group B1  and B2 .  This allows us to apply the assumption P (n) in the 
second step. The last step uses DeMorgan’s original law. 
Since P (2) is true and P (n) ⇒ P (n +  1)   for all n ≥ 2, the principle of induction implies 
that P (n) is true for all n ≥ 2. 
Problem 3.  Let Hn  denote the n­th harmonic sum, which is deﬁned by:

Hn  = 

Harmonic sums come up often. You’ll see them again later in 6.042 and also in 6.046. 
Claim.  H2m  ≥ 1  +  m/2  for all m ≥ 0. 

(a)	 The next problem part will ask you to prove this claim by induction. To make this 
easier,  three steps that you may ﬁnd useful  in your proof are  listed below.  Provide 
a one sentence justiﬁcation for each of these steps.

Solution.  The ﬁrst  step uses  the deﬁnition of H2m+1  .  The  second  step uses  the  fact 
that  the  ﬁrst  2m  terms  of  the  sum  are  equal  to  all  2m  terms  of H2m  .  The  third  step 
uses the fact that a sum is lower bounded by the number of terms times the smallest 
term.

(b)  Prove the claim by induction.  (See? We told you this was going to happen. . . ) 
Solution. We prove the claim by induction. Let P (m) be the proposition that H2m  ≥
1 + m/2. 
Base case. Note that P (0) is true, because: 
H20  =  H1  =  1 ≥ 1 + 0/2 
Inductive step. We must show that P (m) implies P (m   + 1) for all m  ≥ 0. We assume 
2m+1�  1 
that P (m) is true and reason as follows:

H2m  + 2m 

The ﬁrst step uses the deﬁnition of H2m+1  . The second step uses the fact that the ﬁrst 
2m  terms of the sum are equal to all 2m  terms of H2m  . The third step uses the fact that 
a sum is lower bounded by the number of terms times the smallest term. The fourth 
step uses our assumption P (m) and simpliﬁcation.  The last step uses only algebra. 
This shows that P (m  + 1) is true, and so P (m) is true for all m  ≥ 0 by induction. 
(c)  Show that this implies Hn  ≥ 1 + 1 
2  log2  n  when n  is a power of 2. 
Solution. This inequality follows from substituting n  =  log2  m  into the claim. 
Problem 4.  Suppose we want to divide a class of n  students into groups each containing 
either 4 or 5 students. 
(a)	 Let’s try to use strong induction to prove that a class with n  ≥  8 students can be 
divided into groups of 4 or 5. 

Proof.  The proof is by strong induction. Let P (n) be the proposition that a class with 
n  students can be divided into teams of 4 or 5. 
Base  case.  We  prove  that  P (n) is  true  for  n  =  8,  9,  or  10  by  showing  how  to  break 
classes of these sizes into groups of 4 or 5 students: 

8  =  4 + 4 
9  =  4 + 5 
10  = 5 + 5 

4 

Problem Set 2 
Inductive step. We must show that P (8), . . . , P (n) imply P (n + 1)  for all n ≥ 10. Thus, 
we assume that P (8), . . . , P (n) are all true and show how to divide up a class of n + 1 
students into groups of 4 or 5.  We ﬁrst form one group of 4 students.  Then we can 
divide the remaining n − 3  students into groups of 4 or 5 by the assumption P (n − 3). 
This proves P (n +  1), and so the claim holds by induction. 

This proof contains a critical logical error.  Identify the ﬁrst sentence in the proof that 
does not  follow and explain what went wrong.  (Pointing out  that  the claim  is  false 
is not sufﬁcient; you must ﬁnd the ﬁrst logical error in the proof.) 
Solution. The ﬁrst error is in the sentence: 
Then we can divide the remaining n − 3  students into groups of 4 or 5 by 
the assumption P (n − 3). 
If n =  10, then P (n− 3)  =  P (7), which is not among our assumptions P (8), . . . , P (n). 
In this case, P (n +  1)  =  P (11)  is actually false. 
(b)	 Provide a correct strong induction proof that a class with n ≥ 12  students can be 
divided into groups of 4 or 5. 
Solution.  The proof is by strong induction.  Let P (n) be the proposition that a class 
with n students can be divided into teams of 4 or 5. 
Base  case.  We prove  that P (n)   is  true  for n  =  12,  13,  14,  and 15 by  showing how  to 
break classes of these sizes into groups of 4 or 5 students: 

12  =  4  +  4  +  4 
13  =  4  +  4  +  5 
14  =  4  +  5  +  5 
15  =  5  +  5  +  5 

Inductive  step.  We  must  show  that  P (12), . . . , P (n)  imply  P (n +  1)  for  all  n  ≥  15. 
Thus,  we  assume  that  P (12), . . . , P (n)  are  all  true  and  show  how  to  divide  up  a 
class of n +  1   students.  We ﬁrst form one group of 4 students.  Then we can divide 
the  remaining  n  −  3  students  into  groups  of  4  or  5  by  the  assumption  P (n   −  3). 
(Note  that  n  ≥  15   and  so  n −  3  ≥  12;  thus,  P (n −  3)  is  among  our  assumptions 
P (12), . . . , P (n).) This proves P (n +  1), and so the claim holds by induction. 

Problem 5. 
Claim.  If  a  collection  of  positive  integers  (not  necessarily  distinct)  has  sum  n  ≥  1,  then  the 
collection has product at most 3n/3   . 
For example, the collection 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7 has the sum: 

Problem Set 2

2  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  4  +  7  =  22 

On the other hand, the product is:

≤  322/3 
≈ 
3154.2
(a)  As a preliminary step, use strong induction to prove that n ≤ 3n/3  for every inte­
ger n ≥ 0.

Solution.  The  proof  is  by  strong  induction.  Let  P (n)   be  the  proposition  that  n  ≤

3n/3  .

Base case. We show that P (0), P (1), P (2), P (3), and P (4) are true:

03  ≤ 30  →  0  ≤ 30/3 
13  ≤ 31  →  1  ≤ 31/3 
23  ≤ 32  →  2  ≤ 32/3 
33  ≤ 33  →  3  ≤ 33/3 
43  ≤ 34  →  4  ≤ 34/3 

Each implication follows by taking cube roots. 
Inductive step. Now, we show that P (0), . . . , P (n) imply P (n +  1)   for all n ≥ 4. Thus, 
we assume that P (0), . . . , P (n) are all true and reason as follows: 
· 
3(n+1)/3  = 3 3(n−2)/3 
≥ 
3  · (n − 2)
≥ 
(for all n ≥ 7/2)
n +  1 
The ﬁrst step  is algebra.  The second step uses our assumption P (n − 2).  The  third 
step is a linear inequality that holds for all n ≥  7/2.  (This forced us to deal individ­
ually with the cases P (3) and P (4), above.)  Therefore, P (n +  1) is true, and so P (n)  
is true for all n ≥ 0  by induction. 
(b)	 Prove  the  claim using  induction  or  strong  induction.  (You may ﬁnd  it  easier  to 
use induction on the number of positive integers in the collection rather than induction 
on the sum n.) 
Solution. We use induction on the size of the collection. Let P (k) be the proposition 
that  every  collection  of  k  positive  integers  with  sum  n  has  product  at  most  3n/3  . 
First, note that P (1) is true by the preceding problem part. 

6 

Problem Set 2 
Next, we must show  that P (k)  implies P (k +  1)  for all k  ≥  1.  So assume  that P (k) 
is true, and let x1 , . . . , xk+1  be a collection of positive integers with sum n.  Then we 
can reason as follows: 

x1  x2  · · · xk  · xk+1  ≤  3(n−xk+1 )/3  · xk+1
·
≤  3(n−xk+1 )/3  3xk+1 /3 
·
= 3n/3 

The ﬁrst step uses the assumption P (k), the second uses the preceding problem part, 
and the last step is algebra.  This shows that P (k +  1) is true, and so the claim holds 
by induction. 

Problem  6.  Suppose  that  you  take  a  piece  of  paper  and  draw  n  straight  lines,  no  one 
exactly  on  top  of  another,  that  completely  cross  the  paper.  This  divides  the  paper  into 
polygonal  regions.  Prove by  induction  that you  can  color each  region either  red or blue 
so  that  two  regions  that  share  a  boundary  are  always  colored  differently.  (Regions  that 
share only a boundary point may have the same color.) 

Solution.  The  proof  is  by  induction.  Let  P (n)  be  the  proposition  that  the  regions 
deﬁned by n lines can be colored red or blue so that adjacent regions are different colors. 
Base  case:  If n  = 0,  then  there are no  lines and  the whole paper  is a  single  region.  Color 
it  red.  Adjacent  regions  are different  colors  trivially  since  there  are no  adjacent  regions. 
Thus, P (0) is true. 
Inductive  step:  Assume  that  P (n)  is  true.  We  prove  that  P (n  +  1)   is  also  true.  Given 
a  conﬁguration  of  n +  1  lines,  remove  an  arbitrary  line  l.  By  the  assumption  P (n),  the 
polygonal  regions  deﬁned  by  the  remaining  n  lines  can  be  colored  red  or  blue  so  that 
adjacent  regions are  colored differently.  Now add back  the  line  l and  invert  the  color of 
every  region  to one  side of  l.  Adjacent  regions on  the  same  side of  the  line are different 
colors  by  the  induction  assumption  P (n).  Adjacent  region  on  opposite  sides  of  the  line 
are different colors because the colors on one side were inverted. Therefore, P (n) implies 
P (n +  1), and so P (n) is true for all n ≥ 0  by induction. 

Problem 7.  Let’s consider a variation of the Unstacking game demonstrated in lecture. As 
before, the player is presented with a stack of n ≥ 1  bricks. Through a sequence of moves, 
she must reduce this to n single­brick stacks while scoring as many points as possible.  A 
move consists of dividing a single stack of (a +  b) bricks (where a, b > 0) into two stacks 
with heights a and b.  Suppose that this move is worth a +  b points.  Find the best strategy 
and use induction to prove that there is no better strategy. 

Solution. Some experimentation suggests that the best strategy is to remove one block 

Problem Set 2 

at a time. This gives a score of: 

7 

n +  (n − 1)  +  . . . +  3  +  2  = 

= 

− 1 
n(n +  1)  
2 
(n +  2)(n − 1) 
2 

Now we must prove that there is no better strategy. 

Proof.  We  use  strong  induction.  Let  P (n)   be  the  proposition  that  unstacking  n  bricks  is 
worth at most (n +  2)(n − 1)/2   points. 
Base  case:  P (1)  is  true  because  the  game  ends  immediately  when  there  is  only  1  brick. 
Thus, the player ’s score is 0, which is the value of (n +  2)(n − 1)/2  when n = 1. 
Inductive  step:  Now  assume  that  P (1), . . . , P (n − 1)  are  all  true  in  order  to  prove  P (n), 
where n ≥ 2.  Suppose the stack of n bricks is split into stacks of height x and n − x, where 
0  < x < n. The player ’s best possible score for the game is then: 
��

((n − x) +  x) +  (x +  2)(x − 1)/2 + (n − x +  2)(n − x − 1)/2 
to unstack n   − x  bricks 
to unstack x   bricks 
for ﬁrst move 
Here we  are  using  the  assumptions  P (x)  and  P (n − x),  which  specify  the  best  possible 
scores for unstacking x and n − x bricks. Now we must choose x to maximize this expres­
sion. The derivative with respect to x is 2x − n. Thus, the expression decreases as x grows 
from 1 to n/2   and then increases symmetrically as x grows 
from n/2  to n − 1.  Therefore,  the maximum  is achieved when x  = 1  or x  =  n − 1.  In 
both cases, the expression above is equal to: 
(n +  2)(n − 1) 
2 
So we have shown that P (1), . . . , P (n − 1)  imply P (n). 
Therefore, P (n) is true for all n ≥ 1  by the strong induction principle.
