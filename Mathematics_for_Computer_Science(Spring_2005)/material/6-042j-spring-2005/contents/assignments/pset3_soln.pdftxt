Problem Set 3 Solutions 

Due: Tuesday, February 22 at 9 PM 

Problem  1.  An  urn  contains  75 white  balls  and  150  black  balls.  While  there  are  at  least 
2  balls  remaining  in  the  urn,  you  repeat  the  following  operation.  You  remove  2  balls 
selected arbitrarily and then: 

•	 If at  least one of  the  two balls  is black,  then you discard one black ball and put  the 
other ball back in the urn. 

•	 If both of the balls are white,  then you discard them both and put a new black ball 
into the urn. 

Prove that the urn never reaches the state where it is empty except for one black ball. 

Solution.  We use induction.  Let P (n) be the proposition that the urn always contains 
an odd number of white balls. 
Base  case.  Initially,  the  urn  contains  75  white  balls,  which  is  an  odd  number,  so  P (0)  is 
true. 
Inductive step.  Suppose that the urn contains an odd number of white balls after n steps. 
If there are fewer than 2 balls remaining, then the process ends. Otherwise, there are then 
two cases: 

1.  You draw at  least one black ball.  Then  the number of black balls decreases by one 
and  the number of white balls  is unchanged.  Therefore,  the number of white balls 
remains odd. 

2.  You draw two white balls. Then the number of black balls increases by one, and the 
number of white balls decreases by two.  Again, the number of white balls remains 
odd. 

Thus, the urn still contains an odd number of white balls after n +  1  steps.  By induction, 
the urn always contains an odd number of white balls. Therefore, the urn can never hold 
just one black ball and zero white balls, since zero is even. 

Problem 2.  A puzzle  toy  contains  the numbers 1, . . . , 35  written on  small  circular disks. 
The disks are arranged on an oval track with no gaps so that the whole sequence of disks 
can slide clockwise or counterclockwise around the track.

Problem Set 3


In addition, the track runs through a circular dial that is four disks wide. This dial can be 
rotated 180 degrees, reversing the order of the four disks on that portion of the track.  For 
example,  if  the dial were  turned  in  the conﬁguration above,  then  the  the order of 34, 35, 
1, 2 would become 2, 1, 35, 34. 
Suppose that the puzzle is initially in the state shown above with numbers increasing 
counterclockwise around the track. Prove that no sequence of operations has the effect of 
swapping disks only 1 and 2 while leaving all the other disks in the same order. 

Solution.  Associate each conﬁguration of the puzzle with a permutation of the num­
bers 1, . . . , 35   by  taking  the numbers  in counterclockwise order starting  in  the middle of 
the dial. Thus, the example conﬁguration corresponds to the permutation: 

1  2  3  . . .  35 

Now we use induction on the number of operations.  Let P (n) be the proposition that 
after n operations, there are an even number of inversions. 
Base case.  Initially, there are zero inversions.  Since zero is even, P (0) is true. 
Inductive  step.  Suppose  that after n  steps  there are  an  even number of  inversions.  There 
are now three cases to consider: 

•  Suppose the dial is turned 180 degrees. This transforms the permutation 

into the permutation: 

s1s2s3s4  . . . s32s33s34s35 

s35s34s3s4  . . . s32s33s2s1

This amounts to swapping s1  with s35  and s2  with s34 . Each swap changes the parity 
of  the  number  of  inversions,  so  after  two  swaps  there  are  still  an  even  number  of 
inversions. 

•	 Suppose that the numbers are rotated one position clockwise around the track. This 
transforms the permutation 

s1s2s3s4  . . . s32s33s34s35 

into the permutation: 

s2s3s4  . . . s32s33s34s35s1 
This  reverses  the  order  of  exactly  34  pairs  of  disks,  s1  and  every  other  disk.  This 
changes the parity of the number of inversions 34 times, which leaves an even num­
ber of inversions. 

•	 Similarly,  rotating  one  position  counterclockwise  reverses  the  order  of  34  pairs, 
again leaving an even number of inversions. 

By  induction,  the  number  of  inversions  is  always  even.  Therefore,  the  conﬁguration  in 
which 1 and 2 are swapped (which has 1 inversion) is unreachable. 

Problem 3.  A regular 52­card deck is arranged as follows: 
A♥ 2  . . .   K♥ A♣ 2♣  . . .  K♣ A♠ 2♠  . . .  K♠ A♦ 2♦  . . .  K♦ 

In a perfect shufﬂe, the deck is ﬁrst divided into two piles, one containing the top 26 cards 
and  the other  the bottom 26.  These  two piles are  then  recombined  into a  single deck by 
perfectly interlacing them: 

This  interlacing process can be done  in  two different ways since  the new  top card could 
come  from  the  top  of  either  26­card  pile.  So  over  a  sequence  of  perfect  shufﬂes,  many 
different  arrangements  of  the  deck  can  be  obtained.  Prove  that  no  sequence  of  perfect 
shufﬂes puts the deck in the following order: 
A♥ 2♥  . . .   K♥ A♣ 2♣  . . .  K♣ A♦ 2♦  . . .  K♦ A♠ 2♠  . . .  K♠ 

Solution.  We  use  induction.  Deﬁne  the  cards  in  the  i­th  and  (52  − i)­th  positions  in 
the deck to be opposites.  Thus,  for example,  the top card  is opposite the bottom card,  the 
second card is opposite the next to last card, and the two cards in the middle of the deck 

4 

Problem Set 3 

are  opposite  each  other.  Let  P (n)  be  the  proposition  that  opposite  cards  are  the  same 
color. 
Base case.  In the initial conﬁguration, hearts are opposite diamonds and clubs are opposite 
spades. Therefore, all opposite cards are the same color. 
Inductive  step.  Suppose  that all opposite  cards  are  the  same  color.  Consider an arbitrary 
conﬁguration of the deck: 

A perfect shufﬂe leaves the deck in one of the following orders: 

c1c2c3  .  .  .  c52 

c1c27c2c28c3c29  .  .  .  c25c51c26c52 
c27c1c28c2c29c3  .  .  .  c51c25c52c26 

In both  cases,  exactly  the  same  cards  remain opposites:  c1  and  c52 ,  c2  and  c51 ,  etc.  So,  in 
particular, opposite cards are still the same color. 
By  induction,  opposite  cards  are  always  the  same  color.  Therefore,  the  hearts,  clubs, 
diamonds, spades conﬁguration is unreachable since there all opposite cards are different 
colors. 

Problem 4.  Prove the following basic facts about greatest common divisors: 

(a)	 gcd(ka,  kb) =  k  · gcd(a,   b) for all k >  0.

Solution. The smallest positive value of 

· (s  ·
s  · (ka) +  t  · (kb) =  k
·

a  +  t b)
over all s,  t   ∈ Z is k  times the smallest positive value of

·
· 
s a  +  t b
over all s,  t  ∈  Z.  The ﬁrst quantity  is gcd(ka,  kb)  and  the second  is gcd(a,  b).  There­
fore, gcd(ka,  kb) =  k gcd(a,  b). 
(b)  gcd(a,  b) =  gcd(a  +  kb,   b) for all k  ∈ Z. 
Solution. We show that every linear combination of a  and b  is a linear combination 
of a  +  kb  and b  and vice­versa. 
•  If x  =  s a  +  t b, then x  =  s�  · (a  +  kb) +  t�  b  where s�  =  s  and t�  =  t  − s�k .
·
· 	
· 
•  If x  =  s�  · (a  +  kb) +  t�  b, then x  =  s a  +  t b  where s  =  s�  and t  =  t�  +  s�k .
· 
·
· 

Thus, in particular, the smallest positive linear combinations are equal, so gcd(a,  b) = 
gcd(a  +  kb,   b).

Problem 5.  Here is a long run of composite numbers: 

114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126 

Prove  that  there  exist  arbitrarily  long  runs  of  composite  numbers.  Consider  numbers  a 
little bigger than n!  where n! =  n · (n − 1) 
· · ·
·
·
3 2 1.
Solution.  Let  k be  some natural number  such  that  1  <  k  ≤  n.  We know  k 
|
(n! +   k)
because k | n!  and k k . Thus, the numbers n! + 2, n! + 3, n! + 4, . . . , n! + n are all composite. 
|
This is a run of n − 1  consecutive composite numbers. Because we can choose n arbitrarily, 
we know arbitrarily long runs of composite numbers exist. 

Problem 6.  Here is a very, very fun game.  Initially, there is a blackboard with the numbers 
1309  and  1729 written  on  it.  Now  you  and  I  take  turns;  you  go  ﬁrst.  On  each  player ’s 
turn, he or she must write a new positive integer on the board that is the difference of two 
numbers that are already there.  The ﬁrst person who can not create a new number loses 
the game. 
For  example,  your  ﬁrst  move  must  be  1729  − 1309  =  420.  Then  I  could  play  either 
1309  − 420  = 889  or 1729   − 420  = 1309, and so forth. 

(a)	 Prove every number written on the board is a multiple of 7 less than or equal to 
1729. 
Solution.  We use  induction.  Let P (n)   be  the proposition  that after n moves,  every 
number on the board is a positive linear combination of 1729 and 1390. 
Base case.  P (0) is true because 1729 and 1390 are trivial linear combinations of 1729 
and 1390. 
Inductive step.  Assume that after n moves, every number on  the board  is a positive 
linear combination of 1729 and 1390.  The next number written on the board is also 
a positive linear combination, because: 

•	 The rules require the number to be positive. 
•	 The  new  number must  be  a  difference  of  two  numbers  already  on  the  board, 
which  are  themselves  linear  combinations  of  1729  and  1390  by  assumption. 
And a difference of linear combinations is another linear combination. 

By  induction,  every  number  on  the  board  is  a  positive  linear  combination  of  1729 
and 1390.  And every positive  linear combination of 1729 and 1390  is a multiple of 
gcd(1729, 1390)  = 7. 

(b)	 Prove that every positive multiple of 7 less than or equal to 1729 is on the board 
at the end of the game. 
Solution.  Let  x  be  the  smallest  number  on  the  board  at  the  end  of  the  game.  By 
the Division Algorithm, there exist integers q and r such that 1729  =  q · x +  r where 

6 

Problem Set 3 
0  ≤  r  < x.  When  no  more  moves  are  possible,  1729  − x  must  already  be  on  the 
board, and thus so must 1729  − 2x, . . . 1729  − (q − 1)x.  However, 1729  − qx =  r can 
not be on  the board,  since  r  < x and x  is deﬁned  to be  the  smallest number  there. 
The  only  explanation  is  that  r  = 0, which  implies  that  x  |  1729.  By  a  symmmetric 
argument, x | 1390.  Therefore, x is a common divisor of x and y .  The only common 
divisors of 1729 and 1390 are 1 and 7, and x can not be 1 by the preceding problem 
part.  Therefore, 7 is on the board at the end of the game.  Since no more moves are 
possible,  1729   − 7,  1729   − 2 7,  . . . ,  7,  0 must  all be on  the board  as well.  So  every 
· 
positive multiple of of 7  less than or equal to 1729  is on the board at the end of the 
game. 

(c)  Who wins? 
Solution.  There  are  1729/7   =  247  numbers  on  the  board  at  the  end  of  the  game. 
Thus, there were 247 − 2  = 245  moves.  Since you go ﬁrst, you also get the last move 
and win the game. 

Problem 7.  Prove the following theorem. 
Theorem.  If gcd(a, b)  = 1, then gcd(a +  b, a − b)   = 1  or 2. 

Solution.  Since gcd(a, b)  = 1, there exist integers s and t such that: 
s · a +  t · b = 1 
Now there is a linear combination of a +  b and a − b equal to 2: 
(s +  t) · (a +  b) +  (s − t) · (a − b) = 2(s · a +  t · b)   = 2 
Thus gcd(a +  b, a − b) is at most 2, which implies it is equal to 1 or 2.
