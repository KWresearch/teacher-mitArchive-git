Problem Set 7 Solutions 

Due: Monday, April 4 at 9 PM 

Problem 1.  Every function has some subset of these properties: 

injective 

surjective 

bijective 

Determine the properties of the functions below, and brieﬂy explain your reasoning. 

→ 
(a)  The function f  :  R
R deﬁned by f (x) =  e .
x
Solution.  This  function  is  injective,  since  ex  takes  on  each  nonnegative  real  value 
for exactly one x. However, the function is not surjective, because ex  never takes on 
negative values. Therefore, the function is not bijective either. 
→ 
(b)  The function f  :  R
R+  deﬁned by f (x) =  e .
x
Solution.  The function ex  takes on every nonnegative value for exactly one x, so it 
is injective, surjective, and bijective. 
(c)  The function f  :  R → R deﬁned by f (x)  = (x +  1)x(x − 1). 
Solution.  This function is surjective, since it is continuous, it tends to +∞ for large 
positive x,  and  tends  to −∞  for  large negative x.  Thus,  the  function  takes on each 
real  value  for  at  least  one  x.  However,  this  function  is  not  injective,  since  it  takes 
on  the value 0 at x  =  −1, x  = 0, and x  = 1.  Therefore,  the  function  is not bijective 
either. 

(d)  Let S be the set of all 20­bit sequences. Let T  be the set of all 10­bit sequences. Let 
→ 
T  map each 20­bit sequence to its ﬁrst 10 bits.  For example: 
f  :  S

f (11110110101101010010)   = 1111011010 

Solution.  This  function  is surjective since  the sequence b1 b2  . . . b10  is mapped  to by 
b1 b2  . . . b1000   . . . 0,  for  example.  However,  the  function  is  not  injective,  because  this 
sequence  is  also mapped  to by  b1 b2  . . . b1011  . . . 1.  Consequently,  the  function  is not 
bijective either. 

Problem 2.  There are 20 books arranged in a row on a shelf. 

2 

Problem Set 7 

(a)  Describe  a  bijection  between  ways  of  choosing  6  of  these  books  so  that  no  two 
adjacent books are selected and 15­bit sequences with exactly 6 ones. 
Solution. There is a bijection from 15­bit sequences with exactly six 1’s to valid book 
selections:  given such a sequence, map each zero to a non­chosen book, each of the 
ﬁrst  ﬁve  1’s  to  a  chosen  book  followed  by  a  non­chosen  book,  and  the  last  1  to  a 
chosen book.  For example, here  is a conﬁguration of books and  the corresponding 
binary sequence: 
0����

0����
0����
0����
0����
0����
1����
0����

0����
� �� � 
� �� � � �� �	
� �� � 
���� � �� �

Selected books are darkened. Notice that the ﬁrst ﬁves ones are mapped to a chosen 
book and an non­chosen book in order to ensure that the binary sequence maps to a 
valid selection of books. 

(b)  How  many  ways  are  there  to  select  6  books  so  that  no  two  adjacent  books  are 
selected?

Solution. By the Bijection Rule, this is equal to the number of 15­bit sequences with

�  � 
exactly 6 ones, which is equal to 
15 
6 

15!  
6!  9! 

= 

by the Bookkeeper Rule. 

Problem  3.  Answer  the  following  questions  and  provide  brief  justiﬁcations.  Not  every 
problem  can be  solved with  a  cute  formula;  you may have  to  fall back on  case  analysis, 
explicit enumeration, or ad hoc methods. 
You may leave factorials and binomial coefﬁcients in your answers. 

(a)	 In  how  many  different  ways  can  the  letters  in  the  name  of  the  popular  1980’s 
band BAN AN ARAM A   be arranged? 
Solution.  There  are  5  A’s,  2  N ’s,  1  B ,  1  R,  and  1  M .  Therefore,  the  number  of 
arrangements is 

10!  
5!  2!  1!  1!  1! 

by the Bookkeeper Rule. 

(b)	 How many different paths are there from point (0,  0,  0)  to point (12,  24,  36) if ev­
ery step increments one coordinate and leaves the other two unchanged? 
Solution. There is a bijection between the set of all such paths and the set of strings 
containing  12  X’s,  24  Y’s,  and  36  Z’s.  In  particular,  we  obtain  a  path  by  working 

Problem Set 7 

3 

through a string from  left to right.  An X corresponds to a step that  increments the 
ﬁrst coordinate, a Y  increments the second coordinate, and a Z increments the third. 
The number of such strings is: 

72!  
12!   24!  36! 
Therefore, this is also the number of paths. 

(c)  In how many different ways can 2n students be paired up? 
Solution.  Pair  up  students  by  the  following  procedure.  Line  up  the  students  and 
pair the ﬁrst and second, the third and fourth, the ﬁfth and sixth, etc.  The students 
can be lined up in (2n)!  ways. However, this overcounts by a factor of 2n , because we 
would get the same pairing if the ﬁrst and second students were swapped, the third 
and fourth were swapped, etc. Furthermore, we are still overcounting by a factor of 
n!, because we would get the same pairing even if pairs of students were permuted, 
e.g.  the  ﬁrst  and  second  were  swapped  with  the  ninth  and  tenth.  Therefore,  the 
number of pairings is: 

(2n)! 
· 
2n  n!
(d)	 How many different solutions over the natural numbers are there to the follow­
ing equation? 

x1  +  x2  +  x3  +  . . . +  x8  =  100 
A solution  is a speciﬁcation of  the value of each variable xi .  Two solutions are dif­
ferent if different values are speciﬁed for some variable xi . 
Solution.  There  is  a bijection between  sequences  containing  100  zeros  and  7 ones. 
Speciﬁcally,  the  7  ones  divide  the  zeros  into  8  segments.  Let  xi  be  the  number  of 
� 
� 
zeros in the i­th segment. Therefore, the number of solutions is: 
100  +  7 
7 

(e)	 In how many different ways  can  one  choose n out  of  2n  objects,  given  that n of 
the 2n objects are identical and the other n are all unique? 
Solution.  We  can  select  n  objects  as  follows.  First,  take  a  subset  of  the  unique 
objects. Then take however many identical elements are needed to bring the total to 
n.  The ﬁrst step can be done in 2n  ways, and the second can be done in only 1 way. 
Therefore, there are 2n  ways to choose n objects. 
�  � 
(f)	 How many undirected graphs are there with vertices v1 , v2 , . . . , vn  if self­loops are 
permitted? 
n
Solution.  There are 
+  n potential edges, each of which may or may not appear 
2 
in a given graph. Therefore, the number of graphs is: 

2(n 
2 )+n 

4 

Problem Set 7 

(g)	 In how many different ways can 10 indistinguishable balls be placed in four dis­
tinguishable boxes, such that every box gets 1, 2, 3, or 4 balls? 
Solution.  First, we might as well put 1 ball in every box. Now the problem is to put 
the  remaining  6  balls  into  4  boxes  so  that  no  box  gets more  than  3  balls.  Now we 
turn to case analysis.  For example, we could put 3 balls in two boxes and 0 balls in 
the other two boxes. There are  4!  = 6  ways to do this. All cases are listed below: 
2!  2! 

# of ways 
4!
2!  2!  = 6 
4! 
=  24
1!  1!  1!  1! 
4!
3!  1!  = 4 
4!
3!  1!  = 4 
4!
2!  2!  = 6 
Thus, there are 6   +  24  +  4   +  4   +  6  = 44  ways in all.

(h)	 There are 15 sidewalk squares in a row.  Suppose that a ball can be thrown so that 
it  bounces  on  0,  1,  2,  or  3  distinct  sidewalk  squares.  Assume  that  the  ball  always 
moves from left to right.  How many different throws are possible?  As an example, 
a two­bounce throw is illustrated below.

(i)	 In  how many  different  ways  can  the  numbers  shown  on  a  red  die,  a  green  die, 
and a blue die total up to 15? Assume that these are ordinary 6­sided dice. 
Solution. We fall back on explicit enumeration. Let R, G, and B be the values shown 
on the three dice. 

R = 1, B +  G =  14  →  0  ways 
R = 2, B +  G =  13  →  0  ways 
R = 3, B +  G =  12  →  1  way 
R = 4, B +  G =  11  →  2  ways 
R = 5, B +  G =  10  →  3  ways 
R = 6, B +  G = 9  →  4  ways 

(j)	 The working  days  in  the  next  year  can  be  numbered  1,  2,  3,  . . . ,  300.  I’d  like  to 
avoid as many as possible. 

Problem Set 7

•  On even­numbered days, I’ll say I’m sick. 
•  On days that are a multiple of 3, I’ll say I was stuck in trafﬁc. 
•  On days that are a multiple of 5, I’ll refuse to come out from under the blankets. 

In total, how many work days will I avoid in the coming year? 
Solution.  Let D2  be the set of even­numbered days, D3  be the days that are a mul­
tiple  of  3,  and  D5  be  days  that  are  a  multiple  of  5.  The  set  of  days  I  can  avoid  is 
D2  ∪ D3  ∪ D5 . By the Inclusion­Exclusion Rule, the size of this set is:

D2  ∪ D3  ∪ D5 =  D2 | +  D3 +  D5

Problem 4.  Use the pigeonhole principle to solve the following problems. 

(a)	 Prove that among any n2  +  1  points within an n × n square there must exist two 
√
points whose distance is at most 
2. 
Solution.  Partition  the  n × n  into  n2  unit  squares.  Each  of  the  n2  +  1  points  lies 
in  one  of  these  n2  unit  squares.  (If  a  point  lies  on  the  boundary  between  squares, 
assign  it  to a square arbitrarily.)  Therefore, by  the pigeonhole principle,  there exist 
√
two points in the same unit square. And the distance between those two points can 
be at most 
2. 

(b)	 Jellybeans of 6 different ﬂavors are stored in 5 jars. There are 11 jellybeans of each 
ﬂavor. Prove that some jar contains at least three jellybeans of one ﬂavor and also at 
least three jellybeans of some other ﬂavor. 
Solution. We use the pigeonhole principle twice.  Since there are 11 beans of a given 
ﬂavor  and  there  are  only  5  jars,  some  jar must  get  at  least  �11/5�= 3  beans  of  that 
ﬂavor.  Since there are 6 ﬂavors and only 5 jars, some jar must get two pairs of same­
ﬂavored beans. 

(c)	 Prove that among every set of 30 integers, there exist two whose difference or sum 
is a multiple of 51. 
Solution.  Regard the 30 integers as pigeons.  Regard the 26 sets {0}, {1, 50}, {2, 49}, 
. . .,  {25, 26}  as  pigeonholes.  Map  integer  n  to  the  set  containing  n  rem  51.  By  the 
pigeonhole principle, some two pigeons (integers a and b) are mapped to the same 
pigeonhole. Thus, either: 

•  a  rem  51   =  b rem  51  and so the difference of a and b is a multiple of 51. 

6 

Problem Set 7 

•  a  rem  51  +  b rem  51   is either 0 or 51 and so the sum of a and b is a multiple of 
51. 

Problem  5.  A  balanced  parentheses  string  is  a  sequence  of  left  and  right parentheses  such 
that 

•	 the total number of left and right parentheses is equal, and 

•	 the number of left parentheses is greater than or equal to the number of right paren­
theses in every preﬁx. 

For example: 

Balanced 
(()) 
()(()) 

Not Balanced 
((()  more left than right 
())()( 
fewer left than right in preﬁx ()) 

Let Cn  be the number of balanced parentheses strings with 2n parentheses. The values 
C0 , C1 , C2 , . . .  are  the  Catalan  numbers,  which  come  up  in  dozens  of  different  counting 
problems. Here are the ﬁrst few Catalan numbers:

(a)	 Verify the ﬁrst four entries by listing all balanced parentheses strings with at most 
6 parentheses.  (Don’t forget the empty string!) 

Solution.  Here are all the balanced parentheses strings with at most 6 parentheses: 

empty 
()(()) 

() 
(())()  

()()  
(()()) 

(()) 
((())) 

()()() 

Therefore, C0  = 1, C1  = 1, C2  = 2, and C3  = 5  as claimed in the table. 

(b)	 A path from (0, 0)  to (n, n) consisting of unit steps upward or rightward is safe if 
it does not cross the diagonal boundary of the Flaming Chasm of Hideous Death.

Show  that  there  are  exactly  Cn  safe  paths  by  describing  a  bijection  with  balanced 
parentheses strings.

Show that there are Cn  different ways to triangulate a convex (n + 2)­gon by describ­
ing a bijection from triangulations to balanced parentheses strings.  (This problem is 
challenging; ask your TA for help if you’re stuck!) 
Solution. Note that every nonempty balanced parentheses string has the form (α)β 
since  the  ﬁrst  symbol must  be  (  and  there must  be  a matching  ).  Thus,  every  bal­
anced parentheses string can be decomposed into two smaller strings α  and β . We’ll 
exploit this fact to recursively map a balanced parentheses string to a triangulation. 
Suppose  we  have  a  not­yet­triangulated  (n   +  2)­gon  and  a  balanced  parentheses 
string (α)β . We must map the parentheses string to a triangulation. 
Select  two  consecutive  vertices  x  and  y  and  denote  the  remaining  vertices  v0 ,  . . . , 
vn−1 .  It must be that α  contains j  pairs of parentheses and β  contains the remaining 
(n  − 1)  − j  pairs for some j  between 0 and n  − 1.  Draw a triangle with the vertices 
x, y , and vj . 

8 

Problem Set 7


This triangle partitions the polygon into a (j +  2)­gon and a (n − j +  1)­gon.  Trian­
gulate  these  polygons  recursively using  the  balanced parentheses  strings α and  β . 
(Let x and vj  play the role of x and y in triangulation one side, and let vj  and y play 
the role of x and y on the other.) 
Problem 6.  A derangement is a permutation (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) of the set {1, 2, . . . , n} such that 
xi  =�
i for all i.  For example, (2, 3, 4, 5, 1)  is a derangement, but (2, 1, 3, 5, 4)  is not because 
3 appears in the third position. The objective of this problem is to count derangements. 

(a)	 Let’s  ﬁrst  work  on  counting  permutations  of  {1, 2, . . . , n}  that  are  not  derange­
ments.  Let  Si  be  the  set  of  all  permutations  (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )  of  the  set  {1, 2, . . . , n}
such  that  xi  =  i.  Use  the  inclusion­exclusion  formula  to  express  the  number  of 
non­derangements in terms of sizes of intersections of the sets S1 , . . . , Sn .

In each summation, the subscripts are distinct elements of {1, . . . , n}. 
(b)  What is |Si ?|
Solution. There is a bijection between permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n} with i in the i­th 
position and unrestricted permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n} − i. Therefore,  Si = (n − 1)!.
|

(c)  What is  Si  ∩ Sj where i =  j ? 
|

Solution.  The set Si  ∩ Sj  consists of all permutations with i in the i­th position and 
j in the j ­th position.  Thus, there is a bijection with permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n} − 
{i, j }, and so  Si  ∩ Sj = (n − 2)!.
