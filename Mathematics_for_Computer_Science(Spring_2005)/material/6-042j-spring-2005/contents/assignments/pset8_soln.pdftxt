Problem Set 8 Solutions 

Due: Monday, April 11 at 9 PM 
Problem 1.  An electronic toy displays a 4 × 4  grid of colored squares. At all times, four are 
red,  four are green,  four are blue, and four are yellow.  For example, here  is one possible 
'	
$ 
conﬁguration:

(a)  How many such conﬁgurations are possible? 
Solution.  This  is  equal  to  the  number  of  sequences  containing  4  R’s,  4  G’s,  4  B’s, 
and 4 Y’s, which is: 

% 

16!  
(4!)4 

(b)	 Below  the display,  there  are ﬁve buttons numbered  1,  2,  3,  4,  and  5.  The player 
may press a sequence of buttons; however, the same button can not be pressed twice 
in a row. How many different sequences of n  button­presses are possible? 
Solution.  There are 5 choices  for  the ﬁrst button press and 4  for each subsequence 
· 
press. Therefore, the number of different sequences of n  button presses is 5 4n−1  .
(c)	 Each  button  press  scrambles  the  colored  squares  in  a  complicated,  but  nonran­
dom  way.  Prove  that  there  exist  two  different  sequences  of  32  button  presses  that 
both  produce  the  same  conﬁguration,  if  the  puzzle  is  initially  in  the  state  shown 
above. 
Solution.  We use  the Pigeonhole Principle.  Let A  be  the  set  of  all  sequences  of  32 
→ 
button  presses,  let B  be  the  set  of  all  conﬁgurations,  and  let  f  :  A
B  map  each 
sequence of button presses to the conﬁguration that results. Now: 
|A| >  432 
>  16!   >  |B
|

Problem Set 8 

Thus,  by  the  Pigeonhole  Principle,  f  is  not  injective;  that  is,  there  exist  distinct  el­
ements  a1 , a2  ∈  A such  taht  f (a1 ) =  f (a2 ).  In  other words,  there  are  two different 
sequences of button presses that produce the same conﬁguration. 

Problem 2.  Suppose you have ﬁve 6­sided dice, which are colored red, blue, green, white, 
and black. A roll is a sequence specifying a value for each die.  For example, one roll is: 
����  ����  ����  ����  ����) 
(  3 ,  1 ,  4 ,  1 ,  5
green  blue  white  black 
red 
For  the  problems  below,  you  do  not  need  to  simpify  your  answers,  but  brieﬂy  explain 
your reasoning. 

(a)	 For how many rolls is the value on every die different?

Example:  (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  is a roll of this type, but (1, 1, 2, 3, 4)  is not.

·
·
·
· 
Solution. The number of such rolls is 6 5 4 3 2


(b)	 For  how many  rolls  do  two  dice  have  the  same  value  and  the  remaining  three 
dice all have different values? 
� � 
Example:  (6, 1, 6, 2, 3)  is a roll of this type, but (1, 1, 2, 2, 3)  and (4, 4, 4, 5, 6)  are not. 
Solution.  There  are  5
2 possible pairs of  rolls  that might have  the  same value  and 
·
· 
6  possibilities  for what  this  value  is.  There  5 4 3  possible  distinct  values  for  the 
�  � 
remaining three rolls.  So the number of rolls of this type is 
·
5 
2 

·
·
· 
6 5 4 3 

(c)	 For how many rolls do two dice have one value, two different dice have a second 
value, and the remaining die a third value? 
� � 
� �	
Example:  (6, 1, 2, 1, 2)  is a roll of this type, but (4, 4, 4, 4, 5)  and (5, 5, 5, 6, 6)  are not. 
� � 
2 sets  of  two  values  that might  be duplicated.  There  are  5
Solution.  There  are  6
2 
rolls where larger duplicated value may come up and
 3
2 remaining rolls where the

smaller  duplicated  value may  come  up.  There  is  only  1  remaining  roll  where  the 
nonduplicated value may  then come up,  and 4  remaining values  it could  take.  So, 
�  �  �  �  �  � 
the number of rolls of this type is:

(a)  How many different hands are possible? 
Solution.  There is one hand for each way of choosing 7 cards from a 52­card deck. 
�  � 
Therefore, the number of possible hands is: 
52 
7 

by the Subset Rule. 

(b)	 How many hands contain three pairs and no three­of­a­kind or four­of­a­kind? 
� � 
Solution. There is a bijection with sequences specifying: 
� � � � � � 
13
ways.
•  The values of the pairs, which can be chosen in 
3 
•  The suits of the lowest­value pair, which can be chosen in  4
2 ways. 
•  The suits of the middle­value pair, which can be chosen in  4
2 ways. 
•  The suits of the highest­value pair, which can be chosen in  4
2 ways. 
•  The value of the remaining card, which can be chosen in 10 ways. 
•  The suit of the remaining card, which can be chosen in 4 ways.

Thus, the number of seven­card poker hands containing three pairs and no three or 
four­of­a­kind is:

So the seven cards can be chosen in 4

•  The suit of all the cards, which can be chosen in 4  ways.

consisting of:

•  A set of k  face cards, which can be chosen in  12  ways.

Problem 4.  The lecture notes describe a magic trick in which the audience selects 5 cards 
from a deck, the Assistant reveals 4 of these cards in some order, and the Magician deter­
mines the last card. 
Now  suppose  there  are  two  decks  of  cards,  one with  blue  backs  and  one with  green 
backs.  As  before,  the  audience  selects  5  cards.  The Assistant  reveals  4  of  these  cards  in 
some order.  (The Magician is allowed to look at both sides of these cards.)  The Magician 
must determine the suit, value, and back­color of the remaining card. 

(a)  Prove that this is possible. 
Solution.  Construct  a  bipartite  graph  with  a  vertex  on  the  left  for  every  possible 
set  of  5  cards  and  a  vertex  on  the  right  for  every  possible  sequence  of  4  cards.  Put 
an edge between a  set of 5  cards and a  sequence of 4  if every  card  in  the  sequence 
is  also  in  the  set.  In  other  words,  there  is  an  edge  between  a  set  of  5  cards  and  a 
sequence  of  4  if  the Assistant  can  reveal  that  sequence  of  4  provided  the  audience 
selects that set of 5. 
Now  the  magic  trick  is  possible  if  there  is  a  matching  for  the  vertices  on  the  left. 
Speciﬁcally,  the  the  audience picks  a  set  of  5  cards.  Then  the Assistant  reveals  the 
matching  sequence  of  4  cards.  Finally,  the Magician  names  the  remaining  card  in 
the matched set. 
We can prove the existence of the required matching using Hall’s Theorem directly 
(as in the notes) or with a corollary (as in lecture): 

Corollary.  If every vertex on the left side of a bipartite graph has degree c  and every vertex 
on the right has degree d, then there is a matching for the left vertices if c  ≥ d >  0. 
Here we’ll use the corollary.  In this case, each vertex on the left has degree c  =  5 · 4 · 3 · 
2  = 120, since the Assistant can reveal any one of 5 cards ﬁrst, 4 cards second, 3 cards 
third, and 2 cards last.  Each vertex on the right has degree d  =  104  − 4  =  100, since 
the ﬁfth card can be any card  in the two decks other than the four  in the sequence. 
So a matching for the vertices on the left exists by the corollary, and the trick can be 
done. 

(b)  Extra credit: Describe a practical way to perform this trick.  (We have no solution 
to this problem!) 

Problem 5.  Miss McGillicuddy never goes outside without a collection of pets.  In partic­
ular: 

Problem Set 8 

•  She brings 3, 4, or 5 dogs.

•  She brings a positive number of songbirds, which always come in pairs. 

•  She may or may not bring her alligator, Freddy. 

Let Tn  denote  the number of different  collections of n pets  that  can  accompany her.  For 
example, T6  =  2 since there are 2 possible collections of 6 pets: 

•	

3 dogs, 2 songbirds, 1 alligato

•  4 dogs, 2 songbirds, 0 alligators

Problem Set 8 

(a)	 Find a closed­form generating function F (x) for the sequence


(t0 , t1 , t2 , . . .) 


Solution.  From the recurrence equation, this is precisely the sequence: 
(0, 1, 5t1  − 6t0 , 5t2  − 6t1 , 5t3  − 6t2 , . . .)  

We can express this sequence in terms of the generating function F (x):

− 6x2F (x)

= (  0,   5t0  + 1,  5t1  − 6t0 ,  5t2  − 6t1 ,  5t3  − 6t2 , 
The second term is correct; 5t0  + 1 = 1, since t0  = 0.  So we have the equation: 
F (x) = 5xF (x) − 6x 2F (x) + x 

Solving this equation for F (x) gives: 

F (x) = 

x 
1 − 5x + 6x2 

(b)  Rewrite this generating function as a sum of fractions of the form: 

c 
1 − rx 

where c and r are constants.

Solution.  Factoring the denominator gives 1 − 5x + 6x2  =  (1 − 2x)(1 − 3x).  So we

can rewrite the fraction in the form: 


d 
c
x 
1 − 3x 
1 − 2x 
1 − 5x + 6x2 
Substituting  x  =  0 gives  the  equation  c + d  =  0.  Substituting  x  =  1 gives  1/2 =  
− c − d/2 or, equivalently, 2c + d = − 1.  Solving this system of linear equations gives 
c = − 1 and d = 1. Therefore, we have:

Problem 7.  Below is a combinatorial proof of an equation. What is the equation? 

Proof.  Stinky  Peterson  owns  n  newts,  t  toads,  and  s  slugs.  Conveniently,  he  lives  in  a 
dorm with n + t + s other students.  (The students are distinguishable, but creatures of the 
same variety are not distinguishable.) Stinky wants to put one creature in each neighbor ’s 
bed. Let W  be the set of all ways in which this can be done. 
On  one  hand,  he  could  ﬁrst  determine  who  gets  the  slugs.  Then,  he  could  decide 
who  among  his  remaining  neighbors  has  earned  a  toad.  Therefore,  |W is  equal  to  the 
|
expression on the left. 
On  the  other  hand,  Stinky  could  ﬁrst  decide  which  people  deserve  newts  and  slugs 
and then, from among those, determine who truly merits a newt.  This shows that |W is|
equal to the expression on the right. 
Since both expressions are equal to |W , they must be equal to each other.
