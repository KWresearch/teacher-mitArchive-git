Problem Set 10 Solutions 

Due: Monday, May 2 at 9 PM 

Problem 1.  Justify your answers to the following questions about independence. 

(a)	 Suppose  that  you  roll  a  fair  die  that  has  six  sides,  numbered  1,  2,  . . .,  6.  Is  the 
event  that  the  number  on  top  is  a multiple  of  2  independent  of  the  event  that  the 
number on top is a multiple of 3? 
Solution.  Let A be the event that the number on top is a multiple of 2, and let B be 
the event that the number on top is a multiple of 3. We have: 
· 
Pr  (A) · Pr  (B )  = 
=  = Pr  (A ∩ B )

Therefore, these events are independent. 

(b)	 Now  suppose  that  you  roll  a  fair die  that  has  four  sides,  numbered  1,  2,  3,  4.  Is 
the event that the number on top is a multiple of 2 independent of the event that the 
number on top is a multiple of 3? 
Solution.  As  before,  let  A be  the  event  that  the  number  on  top  is  a multiple  of  2, 
and let B be the event that the number on top is a multiple of 3. Now, however, we 
have: 
· 
Pr  (A) · Pr  (B ) = 
2 1

Pr  (A ∩ B )  = 0 
Since these results disagree, the events are not independent. 

But:

(c)	 Now  suppose  that  you  roll  a  fair  die  that  has  eight  sides,  numbered  1, 2, . . . , 8. 
Again,  is  the  event  that  the  number  on  top  is  a  multiple  of  2  independent  of  the 
event that the number on top is a multiple of 3? 
Solution. As before, let A be the event that the number on top is a multiple of 2, and 
let B be the event that the number on top is a multiple of 3. This time, we have: 
· 
Pr  (A) · Pr  (B ) = 
4 2

And: 

Pr  (A ∩ B )  = 1/8 
Therefore, these events are independent.

Problem Set 10 

(d)	 Finally,  suppose  that  you  roll  the  fair,  eight­sided  die  again.  Let  the  random 
variable X be  the  remainder when  the  number  on  top  is  divided  by  2,  and  let  the 
random variable Y be the remainder when the number on top is divided by 3.  Are 
the random variables X and Y independent? 
Solution.  First, let’s tabulate the values of X and Y : 

die roll  X Y

Working from the table, we have: 
Pr  (X = 1  ∩ Y = 1)  = 

But: 

Pr  (X = 1)  · Pr  (Y = 1)  = 

=

Since these results conﬂict, the random variables are not independent. 

Problem  2.  Philo  T.  Megabrain,  a  noted  parapsychology  researcher,  has  discovered  an 
amazing phenomenon! He puts a psychic on each side of an opaque, soundproof barrier. 
Each psychic  rolls a  fair die,  looks at  it,  and  tries  to guess what number came up on  the 
other die by telepathy.  Since the dice are fair and independent, the psychics should guess 
correctly only 1 time in 6. However, after extensive testing, Philo has discovered that they 
actually do slightly better. 

(a)	 Philo’s somewhat­arbitrary policy is to run the test over and over each day until 
both  psychics  roll  a  6  at  the  same  time.  Then  he  immediately  halts  testing  for  the 
day,  before  the  psychics  make  guesses.  Explain  the  ﬂaw  in  Philo’s  experiment  in 
qualitative terms. 
Solution.  If a psychic sees a 6 on her own die, she knows not to guess that the other 
die is a 6. 

(b)	 If a psychic exploits  this ﬂaw optimally, with what probabilty can she guess  the 
number on the opposite die? 

Problem Set 10

Solution.  If she sees a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5,  then her probability of guessing the other die 
is the normal 1/6.  However, if she sees a 6, then she knows that the other die is not 
a 6, and so her probability of guessing  the other die  is 1/5.  By  the  total probability 
law, her probability of guessing the other die correctly in general is:

Problem 3.  There is a set P  consisting of 1000 people. 

+

= 

•	 The favorite color of 20% of the people is blue. 

•	 The favorite color of 30% is green. 

•	 The favorite color of 50% is red. 
(a)	 Suppose we select a set of two people {p1 ,  p2} ⊆ P  uniformly at random.  Let the 
random  variables  C1  and  C2  denote  their  favorite  colors.  Are  C1  and  C2  indepen­
dent?  Justify your answer. 
Solution. No.  For example, Pr   (C1  =  blue)   = 200/1000. However, 
Pr  (C2  =  blue | C1  =  blue)   = 199/999 
since  199  of  the  remaining  999  people  like  blue  after  one  person who  likes  blue  is 
selected. 
(b)	 Suppose we select a sequence of two people (p1 ,  p2 ) ∈ P ×P  uniformly at random. 
Let the random variables C1  and C2  denote their favorite colors. Now are C1  and C2 
independent?  Justify your answer. 
Solution.  Yes.  Let  c(n)  be  the  color  that  the  n­th  person  likes.  The  random  vari­
ables  p1  and  p2  are  independent.  Functions  of  independent  random  variables  are 
independent, so C1  =  c(p1 ) and C2  =  c(p2 ) are independent. 

Problem 4.  Secret documents are disappearing from CIA headquarters. Some documents 
are  simply  misplaced.  But  the  Security  Chief  suspects  that  others  are  begin  stolen  by 
Agent X and passed to the government of Liechtenstein to further its relentless pursuit of 
global domination. Two inspectors are assigned to investigate the matter: 

•	 Inspector AM determines that the event that a document disappears during a given 
day is independent of the event that Agent X is in headquarters that day. 

•	 Similarly, inspector PM determines that the event that a document disappears dur­
ing a given night is independent of the event that Agent X is around that night. 

The Security Chief  concludes  that  the  event  that  a document disappears  is  independent 
of the event that Agent X is present. Therefore, Agent X is probably innocent.

Problem Set 10 

(a)	 Construct  a  probability model  of  the  situation.  State  the  inspectors’  determina­
tions and the Security Chief ’s conclusion as probabilities. 
Solution.  Let the sample space S  be a set of days and nights.  Deﬁne the following 
three events: 

D  =  A secret document disappears 
X  =  Agent X is at headquarters 
A  =  It is daytime. 

Inspect PM says: 

In these terms, Inspector AM says: 
Pr  (D  ∩ X A)  = Pr  (D  | A) · Pr  (X A)

And the Security Chief concludes: 
Pr  (D  ∩ X )  = Pr   (D) · Pr  (X ) 

(b)  Is the Security Chief ’s reasoning correct?  Justify your answer. 
Solution.  The  security  chief  is  wrong.  For  example,  suppose  that  S  consists  of  a 
single day and a single night: 

S  =  {day,  night} 
Assign  night  and  day  each  probability  1/2.  Now  suppose  that Agent  X  is  around 
during the night and a document disappears only at night: 
D  =  {night}
X  =  {night}
A  =  {day} 
Furthermore,  suppose Pr  (day)   =  Pr   (night)   = 1/2.  These suppositions are consis­
tent with the inspectors’ determinations: 
Pr  (D  ∩ X  ∩ A) 
= 0

However, the Security Chief ’s conclusion is wrong, because:

Pr (D ∩ X ) =  Pr (night) =  1/2


But:


Pr (D) · Pr (X ) =  (1/2) · (1/2) =  1/4 
So Agent X may be guilty after all! 

Problem 5.  Suppose you ﬂip n fair, independent coins. Let the random variable X be the 
number of heads that come up. 

(a)	 What is the exact value of Pr (X ≤ k), the probability of ﬂipping k or fewer heads?

(c)	 If you ﬂip a coin 100 times, the probability of ﬂipping exactly 30 heads is approx­
imately 23 out of a million.  Give an upper bound on  the probability of ﬂipping 30 
or fewer heads.

The actual value is about 39.25 · 10−6  . 

≈ 40 · 10−6 

Problem 6.  Many of the best computer algorithms rely on randomization. However, gen­
erating uniform, mutually  independent  random bits  is not  so easy!  (The mathematician 
John von Neumann said, “Anyone who considers arithmetic methods of producing ran­
dom digits is, of course, in a state of sin.”) Fortunately, some algorithms work equally well 
with  pairwise­independent  random  bits,  which  are  relatively  “cheap”.  In  particular,  one 
can covert a set of mutually  independent bits  into an  exponentially  larger set of pairwise­
independent random bits. 
Let B  be a set of n  uniform, mutually­independent 0­1 random variables. 

(a)	 Let S  be a nonempty subset of the bits in B . Let the random variable s  be the XOR 
of all the bits in S .  Show that s  is uniformly distributed on {0,  1}. 
(Hint: Let b  be one of the bits in S  and let s�  be the XOR  of all other bits in S .) 
Solution. 

= 

= 

Pr (s  =  0) =  Pr (s�  =  0 ∩ b  =  0) + Pr (s�  =  1 ∩ b  =  1) 
=  Pr (s�  =  0) Pr (b  =  0) + Pr (s�  =  1) Pr (b   =  1)

We  ﬁrst  rewrite  the  event  s  = 0 and  then  use  the  independence  of  b  and  s� .  The 
remaining  steps  use  the  facts  that  b  is  0  or  1  with  equal  probability  and  that  s�  is 
either  0  or  1  (with  unknown  probabilities).  Since  s  = 0 with  probability  1/2,  we 
must have s  =  1 with probability 1/2 as well, so s  is uniformly distributed on {0,  1}. 
(b)	 Now let T  be another nonempty subset of bits in B . Let the random variable t  be 
the XOR  of all the bits in T .  Show that s  and t  are independent. 
(Hint: Deﬁne s�  to be the XOR  of bits in S  − T , t�  to be the XOR  of bits in T  − S , and i 
to be the XOR  of bits in S  ∩ T . Now consider three cases:  (1) S  ∩ T  =  ∅, (2) S  ∩ T  =  S 
or S  ∩ T  =  T , and (3) S  ∩ T  =  ∅,  S,  or T .)

Solution.  We must show  that Pr (s =  a ∩ t =  b) = Pr (s =  a) Pr (t =  b) for all a and 
b.  By  the preceding problem part, Pr (s =  a) =  Pr (t =  b) = 1/2.  So we  really only 
need to show that for all a and b: 
Pr (s =  a ∩ t =  b) =  1/4 
Deﬁne  random  variables  s� ,  t� ,  and  i as  described  above.  These  random  variables 
are  mutually  independent  since  they  are  functions  of  mutually  independent  bits. 
We  can  rewrite  the  quantity we’re  trying  to  analyze,  Pr (s =  a ∩ t =  b),  in  terms  of 
these variables as follows: 
� 
� 
Pr (s =  a ∩ t =  b) =  Pr (s�  =  a ∩ t�  =  b ∩ i =  0) 
+ Pr  s�  =  a ∩ t�  =  b ∩ i =  1 
� 
� 
=  Pr (s�  =  a) Pr (t�  =  b) Pr (i =  0) 
+ Pr (s�  =  a) Pr   t�  =  b  Pr (i =  1) 

(*) 

Now we analyze the three cases: 
1.  If S ∩ T  =  ∅, then Pr (i =  0) =  1 and Pr (i =  1) =  0. However, the sets S − T  and 
T  − S  are  nonempty,  so Pr (s�  =  a) = Pr (t�  =  b) = 1/2 by  the  preceding  part. 
Substituting into (*) gives:

2.  If S ∩ T  =  S ,  then S − T  =  ∅  and  so Pr (s�  =  0)  = 1 and Pr (s�  =  1)  = 0.  The 
sets S ∩ T  and T − S are nonempty, so i and t�  are uniformly distributed by the 
preceding part.  Substituting into (*) gives: 
· 
Pr (s =  a ∩ t =  b) =  0 · 
+ 1 ·

If S ∩ T  =  T , then a symmetric argument applies. 
3.  If S ∩ T  =  ∅, S,  or T ,  then  the  sets S − T , T  − S ,  and S ∩ T  are all nonempty. 
Therefore, s� , t� , and i are all uniformly­distributed.  Substituting into (*) gives:

Pr (s =  a ∩ t =  b) =

Therefore, s and t are independent. 
(c)  Explain how  to construct a set of 2n  − 1 uniform, pairwise­independent 0­1 ran­
dom variables from a set of n uniform, mutually­independent 0­1 random variables. 
Solution.  Take  the  sums  of  all nonempty  subsets modulo  2.  In  the  two preceding 
parts,  we  proved  that  these  random  variables  are  uniform  and  pairwise  indepen­
dent. 

(The quantity a1  XOR  a2  XOR  . . .   XOR  an  is equal to (a1  + a2  + . . . + an ) rem  2.)
