Problem Set 1 Solutions 

Due: Monday, February 7 at 9 PM 

Problem 1.  The connectives ∧ (and), ∨ (or), and ⇒ (implies) come often not only in com­
puter programs, but also everyday speech.  But devices that compute the nand operation 
are preferable in computer chip designs. Here is the truth table for nand: 

P  Q

T  T 
T  F 
F  T 
F  F 

P nand Q

For each of the following expressions, ﬁnd an equivalent expression using only nand and 
¬ (not). 
(a)  A ∧ B 
Solution. ¬(A nand B ) 
(b)  A ∨ B 
Solution.  (¬A) nand (¬B ) 
B⇒
(c)  A
Solution. A nand (¬B ) 
Problem 2.  A self­proclaimed “great logician” has invented a new quantiﬁer, on par with 
∃ (“there exists”) and ∀ (“for all”). The new quantiﬁer is symbolized by U and read “there 
exists a unique”. The proposition U x P (x) is true iff there is exactly one x for which P (x) is 
true. The logician has noted, “There used to be two quantiﬁers, but now there are three!  I 
have extended the whole ﬁeld of mathematics by 50%!” 

(a)	 Write  a  proposition  equivalent  to  U x  P (x)  using  only  the  ∃  quantiﬁer,  =,  and 
logical connectives. 
Solution. 

x (P (x) ∧ ¬(∃y (¬(x =  y) ∧ P (y)))
∃

(b)	 Write  a  proposition  equivalent  to  U x  P (x)  using  only  the  ∀  quantiﬁer,  =,  and 
logical connectives. 
Solution. 

¬∀x  (¬P (x) ∨ ¬∀y  (x  

=  y  ∨ ¬P (y)))

Problem 3.  A media  tycoon has an  idea  for an all­news  television network  called LNN: 
The Logic News Network.  Each segment will begin with the deﬁnition of some relevant 
sets and predicates.  The day’s happenings can  then be communicated concisely  in  logic 
notation.  For example, a broadcast might begin as follows: 
“THIS  IS LNN. Let S  be  the set {Bill,  Monica,  Ken,  Linda,  Betty}.  Let D(x)  be 
a predicate that is true if x  is deceitful.  Let L(x,  y) be a predicate that is true if 
x  likes y . Let G(x,  y) be a predicate that is true if x  gave gifts to y .” 

Complete the broadcast by translating the following statements into logic notation. 

(a)	 If neither Monica nor Linda is deceitful, then Bill and Monica like each other. 
Solution. 
(¬(D(Monica) ∨ D(Linda)))   ⇒ (L(Bill,   Monica) ∧ L(Monica,  Bill))  

(b)	 Everyone except for Ken likes Betty, and no one except Linda likes Ken. 
Solution. 

x  ∈ S  (x  =  Ken ∧ ¬L(x,  Betty))  ∨ (x   =  Ken ∧ L(x,  Betty))   ∧
∀	
x  ∈ S  (x  =  Linda ∧ L(x,  Ken))   ∨ (x   =  Linda ∧ ¬L(x,  Ken))
∀	

(c)	 If  Ken  is  not  deceitful,  then  Bill  gave  gifts  to Monica,  and Monica  gave  gifts  to 
someone. 
Solution. 

¬D(Ken) ⇒ (G(Bill,  Monica) ∧ ∃x  ∈ S  G(Monica,  x))  
(d)	 Everyone likes someone and dislikes someone else. 

Solution.


x  ∈ S  ∃y  ∈ S  ∃z  ∈ S  (y
∀	

=  z ) ∧ L(x,  y) ∧ ¬L(x,  z )

The  remaining  problems  will  be  graded  primarily  on  the  clarity  of 
your proofs— not on whether you have  the  right  idea.  In  fact,  if you 
can’t ﬁgure out the right idea, we’ll give it to you– just ask your TA!

Problem  4.  Let  n  be  a  postive  integer.  Prove  that  log2  n  is  rational  if  and  only  if  n  is 
a  power  of  2.  Assume  any  basic  facts  about  divisibility  that  you  need;  just  state  your 
assumptions explicitly. 

Solution.  Assumption:  If nb  is a power of 2, then n  is a power of 2. 

Proof.  We prove that if n  is a power of 2, then log2  n  is rational and vice­versa. 
First, we prove that if n  is a power of 2, then log2  n  is rational. Assume that n  is a power 
of 2.  Then n  = 2k  for some  integer k  ≥  0.  Thus,  log2  n  =  log2  2k  =  k , which  is a  rational 
number. 
Next, we prove  that  if  log2  n  is  rational,  then n  is  a power  of  2.  Assume  that  log2  n  is 
rational. That means there exist integers a  and b  such that: 

We can rewrite this equation as follows: 

log2  n  = 

a 
b 

n  = 2a/b 
n b  = 2a 

(Take 2 to power of each side.) 
(Take the b­th power of each side.) 

Thus, nb  is a power of 2. By our assumption, n  is a power of 2. 

Problem 5.  A triangle is a set of three people such that either every pair has shaken hands 
or no pair has shaken hands.  Prove that among every six people there is a triangle.  Sug­
gestion:  Initially, break the problem into two cases: 

1.  There exist at least three people who shook hands with person X . 

2.  There exist at least three people didn’t shake hands with X 

(Why must at least one of these conditions hold?) 

Solution. 

Proof.  We use case analysis.  Let X  denote one of the six people.  There are two possibili­
ties: 

1.  There exist  three people who shook hands with person X .  Now  there are  two  fur­
ther possibilities: 

(a)  Among  these  three,  some  pair  shook  hands.	 Then  these  two  and  X  form  a 
triangle. 
(b)  Among these three, no pair shook hands. Then these three form a triangle.

Problem Set 1 

2.  Otherwise, at most two people shook hands with person X .  Thus, there exist three 
people who didn’t shake hands with X . Again, there are two further possibilities: 

(a)  Among these three, every pair shook hands. Then these three form a triangle. 
(b)  Among these three, some pair didn’t shake hands. Then these two and X  for a 
triangle. 

Problem  6.  Let  x  and  y  be  nonnegative  real  numbers.  The  arithmetic  mean  of  x  and  y 
√
is  deﬁned  to  be  (x  +  y)/2,  and  the  geometric  mean  is  deﬁned  to  be 
xy .  Prove  that  the 
arithmetic mean is equal to the geometric mean if and only if x  =  y . 

Solution. 

Proof.  We  construct  a  chain  of  if­and­only­if  implications.  The  arithmetic mean  is  equal 
to the geometric mean if and only if:

(x   − y)2  = 0 
x  − y  = 0 
x  =  y

These equations reveal something fundamental about the geometry of our three­dimensional 
world; we’ll revisit them in about three weeks.

Solution. 
Proof.  We use case analysis.  Since m ≥ 3, one of four cases must hold: 

1.  m = 3. There are now four subcases: 

(a)	 n = 3. Rewriting the equation in the form


1

e =
 1 +
 1 
−
 1 
2 
n
m
and subtituting in m =  n =  3  implies that e =  6, which is the ﬁrst solution. 
(b)  n =  4.  Substituting  the values of m and n into  the equation show  that e =  12, 
which is the second solution. 
(c)  n  =  5.  Substituting  into  the  equation  shows  that  e  =  30,  which  is  the  third 
solution. 
(d)  n ≥ 6. This implies: 

≤ 
1 
1 
1 
1

3 
n
m 
Thus,  the left side of the equation is strictly less than the right for all e > 0, so 
there are no solutions in this case.

2.  m = 4. There are two subcases: 

(a)  n = 3.  Subsituting gives e =  12, which is the fourth solution. 
(b)  n ≥ 4. This implies:

Again, the left side of the equation is strictly less than the right for all e > 0, so 
there are no solutions in this case. 

+ 

3.  m = 5. There are two subcases: 

(a)  n = 3.  Subsituting gives e =  30, which is the ﬁfth solution. 
(b)  n ≥ 4. This implies: 

≤

Again, the equation can not hold, so there are no solutions in this case. 
4.  m ≥ 6. This implies:

Once more, the equation can not hold, so there are no solutions in this case.
