Problem Set 6 Solutions 

Due: Monday, March 28 at 9 PM 

Problem 1.  Sammy  the Shark  is a ﬁnancial service provider who offers  loans on  the  fol­
lowing terms. 

•	 Sammy  loans  a  client  m  dollars  in  the  morning.  This  puts  the  client  m  dollars  in 
debt to Sammy. 

•	 Each evening, Sammy ﬁrst charges a “service fee”, which increases the client’s debt 
by f  dollars, and then Sammy charges interest, which multiplies the debt by a factor 
of p.  For example, if Sammy’s interest rate were a modest 5% per day, then p would 
be 1.05. 

(a)  What is the client’s debt at the end of the ﬁrst day? 
Solution.  At  the  end  of  the ﬁrst day,  the  client  owes  Sammy  (m   +  f )p  =  mp  +  f p 
dollars. 

(b)	 What is the client’s debt at the end of the second day?

Solution.  ((m +  f )p +  f )p =  mp2  +  f p2  +  f p


(c)	 Write  a  formula  for  the  client’s  debt  after  d  days  and  ﬁnd  an  equivalent  closed 
form. 
Solution.  The client’s debt after three days is 

(((m +  f )p +  f )p +  f )p =  mp 3  +  f p 3  +  f p 2  +  f p.

Problem  3.  There  is  a  bug  on  the  edge  of  a  1­meter  rug.  The  bug wants  to  cross  to  the 
other side of the rug.  It crawls at 1 cm per second. However, at the end of each second, a 
malicious ﬁrst­grader named Mildred Anderson stretches the rug by 1 meter. Assume that 
her action is instantaneous and the rug stretches uniformly. Thus, here’s what happens in 
the ﬁrst few seconds: 

•	 The bug walks 1 cm in the ﬁrst second, so 99 cm remain ahead. 

•	 Mildred stretches  the rug by 1 meter, which doubles  its  length.  So now  there are 2 
cm behind the bug and 198 cm ahead. 

•	 The  bug walks  another  1  cm  in  the  next  second,  leaving  3  cm  behind  and  197  cm 
ahead. 

•	 Then Mildred strikes, stretching the rug from 2 meters to 3 meters.  So there are now 
3  · (3/2)  = 4.5   cm behind the bug and 197  · (3/2)   = 295.5  cm ahead. 
•	 The bug walks another 1 cm in the third second, and so on. 

Your job is to determine this poor bug’s fate. 

(a)  During second i, what fraction of the rug does the bug cross? 
Solution.  During  second  i,  the  length  of  the  rug  is  100i  cm  and  the  bug  crosses  1 
cm. Therefore, the fraction that the bug crosses is 1/100i. 

(b)  Over the ﬁrst n  seconds, what fraction of the rug does the bug cross altogether? 
Solution.  The bug crosses 1/100  of the rug  in the ﬁrst second, 1/200  in the second, 
1/300  in  the  third, and so  forth.  Thus, over  the ﬁrst n  seconds,  the  fraction crossed 
n�  1 
by the bug is: 
100k 
k=1 
(This formula is valid only until the bug reaches the far side of the rug.) 

=  Hn/100 

(c)	 Approximately how many seconds does the bug need to cross the entire rug? 
Solution.  The  bug  arrives  at  the  far  side when  the  fraction  it  has  crossed  reaches 
1.  This  occurs  when  n,  the  number  of  seconds  elapsed,  is  sufﬁciently  large  that 
Hn/100   ≥ 1. Now Hn  is approximately ln   n, so the bug arrives about when: 

≥ 1 
ln   n 
100 
ln  n  ≥ 100 
n  ≥ e  ≈ 1043  seconds

Problem 5.  A seasoned MIT undergraduate can: 

•  Complete a problem set in 2 days. 

•  Write a paper in 2 days. 

•  Take a 2­day road trip. 

•  Study for an exam in 1 day. 

•  Play foosball for an entire day. 

An n­day schedule is a sequence of activities that require a total of n  days.  For example, 
here are three possible 7­day schedules: 

pset, paper, pset, foosball 
paper, study, foosball, pset, study 
road trip, road trip, road trip, study 

Problem Set 6 

5 

(a)	 Express the number of possible n­day schedules using a recurrence equation and 
sufﬁcient base cases. 
Solution. 

S (0) = 1,  
S (1) = 2.  

Any schedule for n > 1  days ends with one of 3 possible 2­day activities or one of 2 
possible 1­day activities.  So 
S (n)  = 2S (n − 1)  +  3S (n − 2)	

for n > 1. 

(b)	 Find  a  closed­form  expression  for  the  number  of  possible  n­day  schedules  by 
solving the recurrence. 
Solution.  The  characteristic polynomial  for  this  linear homogeneous  recurrence  is 
2x − 2x − 3  = (x +  1)(x − 3). Hence the solution is of the form S (n) =  a(−1)n  +  b3n  . 
Letting n = 0, we conclude that a+ b = 1, and letting n = 1, we conclude −a+ 3b = 2, 
so b = 3/4, a = 1/4, and the solution is: 
3n+1  +  (−1)n 
4 

S (n) =

Problem  6.  Find  a  closed­form  expression  for  T (n),  which  is  deﬁned  by  the  following 
recurrence: 

T (0)  = 0  
T (1)  = 1  
T (n) = 5T (n − 1)  − 6T (n − 2)  +  6 

for all n ≥ 2 

Solution.  The  characteristic  equation  is  x − 5x +  6  = 0, which  has  roots  x = 2  and 
2
x = 3. Thus, the homogenous solution is: 
T (n) =  A ·  +  B · 
3n
2n 

For a particular solution, let’s ﬁrst guess T (n) =  c: 
c = 5c − 6c +  6 
c = 3

⇒ 

Our guess was correct; T (n)  = 3  is a particular solution.  Adding this to the homogenous 
solution gives the general solution: 

T (n) = 

A ·  +  B · 
2n 
3n  +  3 

Problem Set 6 

6 

Substituting n = 0   and n = 1  gives: 

0 =  A +  B +  3 
1  = 2A +  3B +  3 
Solving this system gives A =  −7  and B = 4. Therefore: 
T (n) =  −7 2n  +  4  3n  +  3

Problem 7.  Determine which of these choices 

Θ(n),  Θ(n 2  log  n),  Θ(n 2 ),   Θ(1),   Θ(2n ),   Θ(2n  ln  n ),  

none of these 

describes each function’s asymptotic behavior. Proofs are not required, but brieﬂy explain 
your answers. 

(a) 

n +  ln  n +  (ln  n)2 

Solution.  Both n > ln  n and n > (ln  n)2  hold for all sufﬁciently large n.  Thus, for all 
sufﬁciently large n: 

n < n +  ln  n +  (ln  n)2  < n +  n +  n 
So n +  ln  n +  (ln  n)2  = Θ(n). 

(b) 

n2  +  2n − 3 
2n − 7 

Solution.  Observe that: 

n2  +  2n − 3 
n − 7
lim 
n→∞ 
2 
This means,  that  for all sufﬁciently  large n,  the  fraction  lies,  for example, between, 
0.99  and 1.01   and is therefore Θ(1).

Problem 8.  A triangular number is an integer n of the form 

n = 1   +  2  +  3  +  . . . +  k = 

k(k +  1)

where k is a positive integer. 

(a)	 Describe a solution to the four­peg Towers of Hanoi puzzle with k(k +  1)/2  disks 
that requires Tk  moves, where: 

T1  = 1 
Tk  = 2Tk−1  +  2k  − 1 

Solution. 
•	 Move all but the k largest disks to another peg recursively. This requires T (k −
1)  moves. 
•	 Move  the k largest disks  to another peg using  the  three­peg  strategy.  This  re­
quires 2k  − 1  moves. 
•	 Now  move  all  the  other  disks  on  top  of  the  k  largest  disks  recursively.  This 
requires T (k − 1)  moves. 

8 

Problem Set 6 

Thus,  with  this  strategy,  the  total  number  of  moves  required  to  move  a  stack  of 
k(k  + 1)/2 disks is T (k) =  2T (k  − 1) + 2 − 1. 
k
(b)  Find a closed form expression equal to Tk . 
Solution.  This  is an  inhomogenous  linear equation.  Let’s begin by  trying  to ﬁnd a 
particular  solution.  There  is both  an  exponential  term  (2k ) and a  constant  term,  so 
we might guess something of the form a2k  + c: 
a2k  + c  =  2(a2k−1  + c) + 2 − 1 
k 
=  (a  + 1)2k  + 2c  − 1 
⇒ 0 =  2k  + (c  − 1) 

Evidently, the constant term is c  =  1, but the exponential part is more complicated. 
Our recipe says we should next try a particular solution of the form a2k  + bk2k  + 1: 
a2k  + bk2 + 1 =  2(a2k−1  + b(k  − 1)2k−1  + 1) + 2 − 1 
k	
k 
=  (a  − b  + 1)2k  + bk2 − 1 
k
Equating  the  coefﬁcients  of  the  2k  terms gives  a  =  a  − b  + 1, which  implies  b  =  1. 
Thus, a2k  + k2k  + 1 is a particular solution for all a. As long as we have this degree of 
freedom, we might as well choose a  so this solution is consistent with the boundary 
condition T1  =  1 and be done: 
a21  + 1 · 21  + 1 =  1  ⇒  a  =  −1 
Therefore, the solution to the recurrence is Tk  =  (k  − 1)2k  + 1. 
(c)	 Approximately how many moves are required to solve the four­peg, n­disk Tow­
ers of Hanoi puzzle as a function of n?  Assume n  is a triangular number.  (For style 
points, make correct use of asymptotic notation.)
