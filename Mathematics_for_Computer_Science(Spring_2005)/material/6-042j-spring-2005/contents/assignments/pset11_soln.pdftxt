Problem Set 11 Solutions 

Due:  5PM on Friday, May 6 

This  is  a  mini­problem  set.  The  ﬁrst  problem  reviews  basic  facts  about  expectation. 
The second and third are typical ﬁnal exam questions. 

Problem 1.  Answer the following questions about expectation. 

(a)	 There are several equivalent deﬁnitions of the expectation of a random variable. 
If  R  is  a  random  variable  over  sample  space  S ,  then  we  can  compute  Ex  (R)  by 
summing over  individual outcomes or by  summing over values  in  the  range of R. 
Write down these two equivalent deﬁnitions of Ex  (R).

variable.

(c)	 Give a simple expression for Ex  (R) that  is valid when R  is an  indicator random 
variable. 
Solution. 

Ex  (R) = Pr   (R  = 1) 

(d)	 The expectation of a  random variable can often be computed  from expectations 
of  simpler  random  variables.  Rewrite  each  of  the  expressions  below  in  terms  of 
Ex  (R) and Ex  (S ).  Note any conditions that R  and S  must satisfy in order for your 
equations to hold. Here c  is a constant.

Ex (cR) =  c Ex (R) 
Ex (R + S ) =  Ex (R) + Ex (S ) 
Ex (R · S ) =  Ex (R) · Ex (S ) 
The third equation holds only if R and S are independent. 

(e)	 The  expected  value  of  a  random  variable  R  given  that  some  event  E  occurs  is 
denoted Ex (R | E ). Write down two equivalent expressions for Ex (R E ) based on 
|
your answers to part (a).

(f)	 Sometimes  the  job  of  computing  Ex (R)  is  best  broken  down  into  cases.  Let 
E1 , . . . , En  be  events  that  partition  the  sample  space.  Suppose  you  can  compute 
Ex (R | Ek ) and Pr (Ek ) for all k . How do you then compute Ex (R)?

(g)	 Many problems involve a sequence of independent trials, each of which succeeds 
with  probability  p.  What  is  the  expected  number  of  trials  needed  to  obtain  one 
success? 
Solution.  1/p 
Problem 2.  MIT  students  sometimes delay  laundry  for a  few days.  Assume all  random 
values described below are mutually independent. 

(a)	 A busy student must complete 3 problem sets before doing  laundry.  Each prob­
lem  set  requires 1 day with probability 2/3 and 2 days with probability 1/3.  Let B 
be the number of days a busy student delays laundry. What is Ex (B )? 
Example:  If  the ﬁrst problem  set  requires 1 day and  the  second and  third problem 
sets each require 2 days, then the student delays for B =  5 days. 
Solution.  The expected time to complete a problem set is: 
1 · 
+ 2 ·  =

Therefore, the expected time to complete all three problem sets is: 
Ex (B ) =  Ex (pset1) + Ex (pset2) + Ex (pset3)

(b)	 A relaxed student rolls a  fair, 6­sided die  in  the morning.  If he rolls a 1,  then he 
does  his  laundry  immediately  (with  zero days  of delay).  Otherwise,  he delays  for 
one day and repeats the experiment the following morning. Let R be the number of 
days a relaxed student delays laundry. What is Ex (R)? 
Example:  If the student rolls a 2 the ﬁrst morning, a 5 the second morning, and a 1 
the third morning, then he delays for R =  2 days. 
Solution.  If we  regard doing  laundry  as  a  failure,  then  the mean  time  to  failure  is 
1/(1/6)  =  6.  However,  this counts  the day  laundry  is done,  so  the number of days 
delay is 6 − 1 =  5. Alternatively, we could derive the answer as follows:

(c)	 Before doing laundry, an unlucky student must recover from illness for a number 
of days equal to the product of the numbers rolled on two fair, 6­sided dice. Let U be 
the expected number of days an unlucky student delays laundry. What is Ex (U )? 
Example:  If the rolls are 5 and 3, then the student delays for U  =  15 days. 
Solution.  Let D1  and D2  be  the  two die rolls.  Recall  that a die roll has expectation 
7/2. Thus:

What is the expected number of adjacent pairs with the same value?  In the example, there 
are two adjacent pairs with the same value, the 3’s and the 5’s. 

Solution.  Consider  an  adjacent  pair.  The  left  card matches  only  one  of  the  other  11 
cards, which is equally likely to be in any of the 11 other positions.  Therefore, the proba­
bility that an adjacent pair matches is 1/11.  Since there are 11 adjacent pairs, the expected 
number of matches is 11   · 1/11   = 1   by linearity of expectation.
