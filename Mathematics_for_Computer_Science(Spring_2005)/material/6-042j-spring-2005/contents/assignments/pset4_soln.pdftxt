(a  − a), which means a  ≡ a  (mod   n).

Problem  1.  Prove  all  of  the  following  statements  except  for  the  two  that  are  false;  for 
those, provide counterexamples. Assume n  >  1. When proving each statement, you may 
assume all its predecessors. 
(a)	 a  ≡ a  (mod  n) 
Solution. Every number divides zero, so n 
(b)  a  ≡ b  (mod  n) implies b  ≡ a  (mod  n)  
(a  − b), which means there is an 
Solution.  The statement a  ≡  b  (mod   n) implies n

integer k  such that nk  =  a  − b. Thus, n(−k) =  b − a

(b − a) as well. This means 
, so n 
b  ≡ a  (mod  n). 
(c)	 a  ≡ b  (mod  n) and b  ≡ c  (mod  n) implies a  ≡ c  (mod  n)  
(a  − b) and n 
|	
(b − c). Thus, n  divides the

Solution. The two assumptions imply n

(a  − c).
linear combination (a  − b) +  (b  − c) =  a  − c  as well. This means n 
(d)  a  ≡ b  (mod  n) implies a  +  c  ≡ b  +  c  (mod   n) 
Solution.  The  ﬁrst  statement  implies  n  |  (a  −  b).  Rewriting  the  right  side  gives 
(a  +  c) − (b  +  c), which means a  +  c  ≡ b  +  c  (mod   n).

(e)  a  ≡ b  (mod  n) implies ac   ≡ bc  (mod  n)

(a−b). Thus, n  also divides c(a−b) =  ac−bc. 
Solution. The ﬁrst statement implies n 
Therefore, ac  ≡ bc   (mod  n). 
(f)	 ac  ≡ bc   (mod  n) implies a  ≡ b  (mod   n) provided c 
�≡ 0  (mod   n). 
Solution. This is false.  For example, 6 2  ≡ 8  · 2  (mod   4), but 6 
�≡ 8  (mod   4).
· 
(g)	 a  ≡ b  (mod  n) and c  ≡ d  (mod  n) imply a  +  c  ≡ b  +  d  (mod  n)

Solution. The assumptions, together with part (e), give:

a  +  c  ≡ b  +  c 
b  +  c  ≡ b  +  d 
Now part (c) implies a  +  c  ≡ b  +  d  (mod  n).

Problem Set 4

(mod   n)


(h)	 a  ≡ b  (mod  n) and c  ≡ d  (mod  n) imply ac  ≡ bd  (mod  n) 

Solution. The assumptions, together with part (e), give: 

ac  ≡ bc 
bc  ≡ bd 
Now part (c) implies ac  ≡ bc   (mod   n).

(i)	 a  ≡ b  (mod  n) implies ak  ≡ bk  (mod   n) for all k  ≥ 0. 
Solution.  We use induction.  Suppose that a  ≡  b  (mod   n).  Let P (k) be the proposi­
tion that a ≡ bk  . 
k
Base case. P (0) is true, since a =  b0  = 1  and 1  ≡ 1  (mod   n) by part (a). 
0
Inductive step.  For k  ≥  0, we assume P (k)  to prove P (k  +  1).  Thus, assume a ≡  bk 
k
(mod  n).  Combining this assmption and the fact that a  ≡  b  (mod   n)  using part (g), 
k+1  ≡ bk+1
(mod  n).

we get a
By induction, P (k) holds for all k  ≥ 0.

(j)	 a  ≡ b  (mod  n) implies ka  ≡ k b  (mod  n) for all k  ≥ 0.

Solution. This is false.  For example, 0  ≡ 3  (mod   3), but 20 
(k)  (a  rem  n)  ≡ a  (mod  n) 
Solution.  By  deﬁnition  of  rem  ,  a  rem  n  =  a  − qn  for  some  integer  q .  So  we  can 
reason as follows: 
(a  rem  n)  ≡ a  − qn 
(mod  n)  
from (d) and qn  ≡ 0 
≡ a 
(mod  n) 
Problem 2.  Prove that there exists an integer k−1  such that 
k k−1  ≡ 1 
· 
(mod   n)
provided gcd(k , n) = 1. Assume n  >  1. 

�≡ 23  (mod  3).


(mod   n)  

Solution.  If  gcd(k , n)  = 1,  then  there  exist  integers  x  and  y  such  that  kx   +  yn  = 1. 
Therefore, yn   = 1   − kx, which means n 
(1  − kx) and so kx  ≡ 1  (mod   n). Let k−1  be x.

Problem 3.  Reviewing  the analysis of RSA may help you  solve  the  following problems. 
You may assume results proved in recitation. 

(a)	 Let n  be a nonnegative integer.  Prove that n  and n5  have the same last digit.  For 
example: 

25  =  32 

795  =  3077056399 

Solution.  The correctness of RSA relies on the following fact:  if p  and q  are distinct 
primes, then 
m 1+k(p−1)(q−1)  ≡ m 
(mod   pq)

for all m  and k .  Setting k  = 1, p  = 5, and q  = 2  proves the claim. 


Problem Set 4 

(b)  Suppose that p1 , . . . , pk  are distinct primes. Prove that 
m1+(p1−1)(p2−1)···(pk−1)  ≡ m 
(mod   p1p2  · · · pk )

for all m and all k ≥ 1.

Solution.  If m is a multiple of a prime pj , then 
m1+(p1−1)(p2−1)···(pk−1)  ≡ m 

(mod  pj )

(*) 

holds, because both sides are congruent  to 0.  If m is not a multiple of pj ,  then con­
gruence (*) still holds because: 
m1+(p1−1)(p2−1)···(pk−1)   ≡ m · (mpj −1 )(p1−1)(p2−1)···(pk−1)/(pj −1) 
(mod   pj ) 
≡ m · 1(p1−1)(p2−1)···(pk−1)/(pj −1) 
(mod   pj )
≡ m 
(mod   pj )

The second step uses Fermat’s Theorem. Now the congruence (*) means that: 
pj  | 
m1+(p1−1)(p2−1)···(pk−1)  − m
Thus, pj  appears in the prime factorization of right side. Since this argument is valid 
for every prime pj  where 1  ≤  j ≤  k , all of the primes p1 , . . . , pk  appear in the prime 
factorization of: 
1+(p1−1)(p2−1)···(pk−1)  − m

m 

Therefore: 

· · · pk  | 
m1+(p1−1)(p2−1)···(pk−1)  − m
p1p2 
Rewriting this as a congruence gives: 
m1+(p1−1)(p2−1)···(pk−1)  ≡ m 

(mod  p1p2  · · · pk ) 

Problem 4.  Suppose that p is a prime. 
(a)	 An integer k is self­inverse if k ·k ≡ 1  (mod   p). Find all integers that are self­inverse 
mod p. 
Solution.  The  congruence  holds  if  and  only  if  p
p (k +  1)(k − 1).  this holds if and only if either p
|	
(mod  p). 
(b)	 Wilson’s Theorem says that (p − 1)!  ≡ −1  (mod   p). The English mathematician Ed­
ward Waring said that this statement would probably be extremely difﬁcult to prove 
because  no  one  had  even  devised  an  adequate  notation  for  dealing  with  primes. 
(Gauss  proved  it  while  standing.)  Your  turn!  Stand  up,  if  you  like,  and  try  can­
celling terms of (p − 1)!   in pairs. 
Solution.  If  p  = 2,  then  the  theorem  holds,  because  1!  ≡  −1  (mod   2).  If  p >   2, 
then p − 1  and 1  are distinct terms in the product 1 2  · · · · (p − 1), and these are the

only  self­inverses.  Consequently, we can pair each of  the  remaining  terms with  its 
multiplicative  inverse.  Since  the product of  a number  and  its  inverse  is  congruent 
to 1, all of these remaining terms cancel. Therefore, we have:
