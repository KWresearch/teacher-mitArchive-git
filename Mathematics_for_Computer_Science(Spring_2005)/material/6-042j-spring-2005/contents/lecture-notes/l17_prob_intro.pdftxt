Introduction to Probability 

Probability  is  the  last  topic  in  this  course  and  perhaps  the  most  important.  Many 
algorithms  rely  on  randomization.  Investigating  their  correctness  and  performance  re­
quires probability theory. Moreover, many aspects of computer systems, such as memory 
management, branch prediction, packet routing, and load balancing are designed around 
probabilistic assumptions and analyses. Probability also comes up in information theory, 
cryptography, artiﬁcial intelligence, and game theory.  Beyond these engineering applica­
tions,  an understanding  of probability gives  insight  into many  everyday  issues,  such  as 
polling, DNA testing, risk assessment, investing, and gambling. 
So probability is good stuff. 

1  Monty Hall 

In  the  September  9,  1990  issue  of  Parade  magazine,  the  columnist  Marilyn  vos  Savant 
responded to this letter: 

Suppose  you’re  on  a  game  show,  and  you’re  given  the  choice  of  three  doors.  Behind 
one door is a car, behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say number 1, and the host, 
who  knows what’s  behind  the  doors,  opens  another  door,  say  number  3,  which  has  a 
goat.  He says to you, ”Do you want to pick door number 2?” Is it to your advantage 
to switch your choice of doors? 

Craig.  F. Whitaker 
Columbia, MD 

The letter roughly describes a situation faced by contestants on the 1970’s game show 
Let’s Make a Deal, hosted by Monty Hall and Carol Merrill.  Marilyn replied that the con­
testant  should  indeed  switch.  But  she  soon  received  a  torrent  of  letters—  many  from 
mathematicians—  telling her  that  she was wrong.  The problem generated  thousands of 
hours of heated debate. 
Yet  this  is  is  an  elementary  problem with  an  elementary  solution.  Why was  there  so 
much dispute? Apparently, most people believe they have an intuitive grasp of probability. 
(This is in stark contrast to other branches of mathematics; few people believe they have 
an intuitive ability to compute integrals or factor large integers!) Unfortunately, approxi­
mately 100% of those people are wrong.  In fact, everyone who has studied probability at 

2 

Introduction to Probability 

length can name a half­dozen problems  in which  their  intuition  led  them astray— often 
embarassingly so. 
The way to avoid errors is to distrust informal arguments and rely instead on a rigor­
ous, systematic approach.  In short:  intuition bad, formalism good.  If you insist on relying 
on intuition, then there are lots of compelling ﬁnancial deals we’d love to offer you! 

1.1  The Four­Step Method 

Every  probability  problem  involves  some  sort  of  randomized  experiment,  process,  or 
game. And each such problem involves two distinct challenges: 

1.  How do we model the situation mathematically? 

2.  How do we solve the resulting mathematical problem? 

In this section, we  introduce a four­step approach to questions of the form, “What  is the 
probability  that  —–  ?”  In  this  approach,  we  build  a  probabilistic  model  step­by­step, 
formalizing  the  original  question  in  terms  of  that  model.  Remarkably,  the  structured 
thinking that this approach imposes reduces many famously­confusing problems to near 
triviality. For example, as you’ll see, the four­step method cuts through the confusion sur­
rounding the Monty Hall problem like a Ginsu knife. However, more complex probability 
questions may  spin off challenging counting,  summing,  and approximation problems— 
which, fortunately, you’ve already spent weeks learning how to solve! 

1.2  Clarifying the Problem 

Craig’s  original  letter  to Marilyn  vos  Savant  is  a  bit  vague,  so  we must make  some  as­
sumptions in order to have any hope of modeling the game formally: 

1.  The car is equally likely to be hidden behind each of the three doors. 

2.  The  player  is  equally  likely  to  pick  each  of  the  three  doors,  regardless  of  the  car ’s 
location. 

3.  After the player picks a door, the host must open a different door with a goat behind 
it and offer the player the choice of staying with the original door or switching. 

4.  If the host has a choice of which door to open, then he is equally likely to select each 
of them. 

In  making  these  assumptions,  we’re  reading  a  lot  into  Craig  Whitaker ’s  letter.  Other 
interpretations are at least as defensible, and some actually lead to different answers. But 
let’s accept these assumptions for now and address the question, “What is the probability 
that a player who switches wins the car?” 

Introduction to Probability 

1.3  Step 1:  Find the Sample Space 

3 

Our  ﬁrst  objective  is  to  identify  all  the  possible  outcomes  of  the  experiment.  A  typical 
experiment  involves  several  randomly­determined  quantities.  For  example,  the Monty 
Hall game involves three such quantities: 

1.  The door concealing the car. 

2.  The door initially chosen by the player. 

3.  The door that the host opens to reveal a goat. 

Every  possible  combination  of  these  randomly­determined  quantities  is  called  an  out­
come. The set of all possible outcomes is called the sample space for the experiment. 
A  tree  diagram  is  a  graphical  tool  that  can  help  us  work  through  the  four­step  ap­
proach when the number of outcomes is not too large or the problem is nicely structured. 
In particular, we can use a tree diagram to help understand the sample space of an exper­
iment.  The ﬁrst randomly­determined quantity in our experiment is the door concealing 
the prize. We represent this as a tree with three branches: 

In  this diagram,  the doors are  called A, B ,  and C  instead of 1,  2,  and  3 because we’ll be 
adding a  lot of other numbers to the picture  later.  Now,  for each possible  location of the 
prize, the player could initially chose any of the three doors. We represent this by adding 
a second layer to the tree: 

carlocationCAB4 

Introduction to Probability


Finally,  the  host  opens  a  door  to  reveal  a  goat.  The  host  has  either  one  choice  or  two, 
depending  on  the  position  of  the  car  and  the  door  initially  selected  by  the  player.  For 
example,  if  the  prize  is  behind  door A  and  the  player  picks  door  B,  then  the  host must 
open door C. However,  if  the prize  is  behind door A  and  the  player  picks door A,  then 
the host could open either door B or door C. All of these possibilities are worked out in a 
third layer of the tree: 

carlocationplayer’sinitial guessCCABABCABCABIntroduction to Probability


5 

Now  let’s  relate  this  picture  to  the  terms  we  introduced  earlier:  the  leaves  of  the  tree 
represent outcomes of the experiment, and the set of all leaves represents the sample space. 
Thus, for this experiment, the sample space consists of 12 outcomes.  For reference, we’ve 
labeled each outcome with a triple of doors indicating: 

(door concealing prize,  door initially chosen,  door opened to reveal a goat) 
� 
� 
In these terms, the sample space is the set: 

(A, C, B ),  
(C, B , A), 

(B , A, C ),  
(C, C, A),  

(B , B , A),
(C, C, B ) 

S  = 

(A, A, B ), 
(B , B , C ), 

(A, A, C ), 
(B , C, A), 

(A, B , C ),  
(C, A, B ),  

The  tree  diagram  has  a  broader  interpretation  as well:  we  can  regard  the whole  exper­
iment  as  “walk”  from  the  root  down  to  a  leaf,  where  the  branch  taken  at  each  stage  is 
randomly determined. Keep this interpretation in mind; we’ll use it again later. 

1.4  Step 2: Deﬁne Events of Interest 

Our  objective  is  to  answer  questions  of  the  form  “What  is  the  probability  that  —–  ?”, 
where the horizontal line stands for some phrase such as “the player wins by switching”, 
“the  player  initially  picked  the  door  concealing  the  prize”,  or  “the  prize  is  behind  door 
C”. Almost any such phrase can be modeled mathematically as an event, which is deﬁned 
to be a subset of the sample space.

Introduction to Probability 

For example, the event that the prize is behind door C   is the set of outcomes: 
{(C, A, B ), (C, B , A), (C, C, A), (C, C, B )} 

The  event  that  the player  initially picked  the door  concealing  the prize  is  the  set of out­
comes: 
{(A, A, B ), (A, A, C ), (B , B , A), (B , B , C ), (C, C, A), (C, C, B )} 
And  what  we’re  really  after,  the  event  that  the  player  wins  by  switching,  is  the  set  of 
outcomes: 

{(A, B , C ), (A, C, B ), (B , A, C ), (B , C, A), (C, A, B ), (C, B , A)} 

Let’s annonate our tree diagram to indicate the outcomes in this event. 

Notice  that  exactly  half  of  the  outcomes  are  marked,  meaning  that  the  player  wins  by

switching  in half  of  all  outcomes.  You might  be  tempted  to  conclude  that  a player who

all equally likely, as we’ll see shortly. 

1.5  Step 3: Determine Outcome Probabilities 

So far we’ve enumerated all the possible outcomes of the experiment. Now we must start 
assessing the likelihood of those outcomes.  In particular, the goal of this step is to assign

each  outcome  a  probability,  which  is  a  real  number  between  0  and  1.  The  sum  of  all 
outcome probabilities must be 1, reﬂecting the fact that exactly one outcome must occur. 
Ultimately, outcome probabilities are determined by the phenomenon we’re modeling 
and  thus  are  not  quantities  that  we  can  derive  mathematically.  However,  mathematics 
can help us compute  the probability of every outcome based on  fewer and more elementary 
modeling decisions.  In particular, we’ll break the task of determining outcome probabilities 
into two stages. 

1.5.1  Step 3a: Assign Edge Probabilities 

First, we  record a probability on each  edge of  the  tree diagram.  These edge­probabilities 
are determined by the assumptions we made at the outset:  that the prize is equally likely 
to  be  behind  each  door,  that  the  player  is  equally  likely  to  pick  each  door,  and  that  the 
host is equally likely to reveal each goat, if he has a choice. Notice that when the host has 
no choice regarding which door to open, the single branch is assigned probability 1. 

1.5.2  Step 3b: Compute Outcome Probabilities 

Our next  job  is  to convert edge probabilities  into outcome probabilities.  This  is a purely 
mechanical process:  the probability of an outcome is equal to the product of the edge­probabilities 

carlocationplayer’sinitial guessdoorrevealedswitchwins?CCCABABABCABCABACACC1/31/31/31/31/31/31/31/31/31/31/31/31111111/2B1/21/21/2AB1/21/2outcomeXXXXXXB(A,A,B)(A,A,C)(A,B,C)(B,A,C)(B,B,A)(B,B,C)(B,C,A)(C,A,B)(C,B,A)(C,C,A)(C,C,B)(A,C,B)8

We’ll justify this process formally next time.  In the meanwhile, here is a nice informal 
justiﬁcation  to  tide  you  over.  Remember  that  the whole  experiment  can  be  regarded  as 
a walk  from  the root of  the  tree diagram down  to a  leaf, where  the branch  taken at each 
step  is  randomly  determined.  In  particular,  the  probabilities  on  the  edges  indicate  how 
likely the walk is to proceed along each path.  For example, a walk starting at the root in 
our example is equally likely to go down each of the three top­level branches. 

Now, how likely is such a walk to arrive at the topmost outcome, (A,   A,  B )? Well, there 
is a 1­in­3 chance that a walk would follow the A­branch at the top level, a 1­in­3 chance it 
would continue along the A­branch at the second level, and 1­in­2 chance it would follow 
the B ­branch at the third level. Thus, it seems that about 1 walk in 18 should arrive at the 
(A,  A,  B ) leaf, which is precisely the probability we assign it. 

Anyway, let’s record all the outcome probabilities in our tree diagram. 

Specifying  the probability of each outcome amounts  to deﬁning a  function  that maps 
each  outcome  to  a  probability.  This  function  is  usually  called  Pr.  In  these  terms,  we’ve

etc. 

Pr  (A, B , C ) = 

Earlier,  we  noted  that  the  sum  of  all  outcome  probabilties  must  be  1  since  exactly  one 
� 
outcome must occur. We can now express this symbolically: 
Pr  (x)   = 1 
x∈S 

In this equation, S  denotes the sample space. 
Though  Pr  is  an  ordinary  function,  just  like  your  old  friends  f  and  g  from  calculus, 
we will  subject  it  to  all  sorts  of  horrible  notational  abuses  that  f  and  g  were mercifully 
spared.  Just for starters, all of the following are common notations for the probability of 
an outcome x: 

p(x) 
Pr   x
Pr[x] 
Pr(x) 
Pr  (x) 
A  sample  space S  and a probability  function Pr  :  S  →  [0, 1]  together  form a probability 
space. Thus, a probability space describes all possible outcomes of an experiment and the 
probability of each outcome. A probability space is a complete mathematical model of an 
experiment. 

1.6  Step 4: Compute Event Probabilities 

We now have a probability for each outcome, but we want to determine the probability of 
an event. We can bridge this gap with a deﬁnition:  the probability of an event is the sum of the 
probabilities  of  the  outcomes  it  contains.  As a notational matter,  the probability of an  event 
� 
E  ⊆ S  is written Pr  (E ). Thus, our deﬁnition of the probability of an event can be written: 
Pr   (x)  
x∈E 

Pr  (E )  = 

For example, the probability of the event that the player wins by switching is: 

Pr  (switching wins)  = Pr   (A, B , C ) +  Pr  (A, C, B ) +  Pr  (B , A, C ) + 
Pr  (B , C, A) +  Pr   (C, A, B ) +  Pr  (C, B , A)

Introduction to Probability 

It seems Marilyn’s answer is correct; a player who switches doors wins the car with prob­
ability 2/3!  In contrast, a player who stays with his or her original door wins with proba­
bility 1/3, since staying wins if and only if switching loses. 
We’re  done with  the  problem!  We  didn’t  need  any  appeals  to  intuition  or  ingenious 
analogies.  In  fact,  no mathematics more difﬁcult  than adding and multiplying  fractions 
was  required.  The only hard part was  resisting  the  temptation  to  leap  to an “intuitively 
obvious” answer. 

1.7  An Alternative Interpretation of the Monty Hall Problem 

Was Marilyn  really  right?  A more  accurate  conclusion  is  that  her  answer  is  correct  pro­
vided we accept her interpretation of the question. There is an equally plausible interpretation 
in  which  Marilyn’s  answer  is  wrong.  Notice  that  Craig Whitaker ’s  original  letter  does 
not say that the host is required to reveal a goat and offer the player the option to switch, 
merely that he did these things.  In fact, on the Let’s Make a Deal show, Monty Hall some­
times simply opened the door that the contestant picked initially. Therefore, if he wanted 
to, Monty could give  the option of switching only  to contestants who picked  the correct 
door initially.  If this case, switching never works! 

2  Strange Dice 

Let’s  play  Strange  Dice!  The  rules  are  simple.  There  are  three  dice,  A,  B ,  and  C .  Not 
surprisingly, the dice are numbered strangely, as shown below: 

The number on each concealed  face  is  the same as  the number on  the opposite, exposed 
face.  The rules are simple.  You pick one of the three dice, and then I pick one of the two 
remainders. We both roll and the player with the higher number wins. 

BAC213675948Introduction to Probability 

11 

Which  of  the  dice  should  you  choose  to maximize  your  chances  of  winning?  Die  B 
is appealling,  because  it has a 9,  the highest number overall.  Then again, die A  has  two 
relatively  large numbers,  6  and  7.  But die C  has  an  8  and no very  small numbers  at  all. 
Intuition gives no clear answer! 

2.1  Analysis of Strange Dice 

We can analyze Strange Dice using our standard, four­step method for solving probability 
problems. To fully understand the game, we need to consider three different experiments, 
corresponding to the three pairs of dice that could be pitted against one another. 

2.1.1  Die A versus Die B 

First, let’s determine what happens when die A  is played against die B . 
Step 1:  Find  the sample space.  The sample space  for  this experiment  is worked out  in  the 
tree diagram show below.  (Actually, the whole probability space is worked out in this one 
picture.  But pretend  that each  component  sort of  fades  in— nyyyrrroom!— as you  read 
about the corresponding step below.) 

For this experiment, the sample space is a set of nine outcomes: 
S  =  { (2,  1),  (2,  5),  (2,  9),  (6,  1),  (6,  5),  (6,  9),  (7,  1),  (7,  5),  (7,  9)  }

Introduction to Probability 

Step 2: Deﬁne events of interest.  We are interested in the event that the number on die A is 
greater than the number on die B . This event is a set of ﬁve outcomes: 
{ (2, 1),  (6, 1), (6, 5), (7, 1),  (7, 5)  } 
These outcomes are marked A in the tree diagram above. 
Step 3: Determine outcome probabilities.  To ﬁnd outcome probabilities, we ﬁrst assign prob­
abilities to edges in the tree diagram. Each number on each die comes up with probability 
1/3, regardless of the value of the other die. Therefore, we assign all edges probability 1/3. 
The probability of an outcome  is  the product of probabilities on  the corresponding root­
to­leaf path, which means that every outcome has probability 1/9. These probabilities are 
recorded on the right side of the tree diagram. 
Step 4: Compute event probabilities.  The probability of an event is the sum of the probabili­
ties of the outcomes in that event.  Therefore, the probability that die A comes up greater 
than die B is: 

Pr  (A > B )  = Pr  (2, 1)  +  Pr   (6, 1)  +  Pr   (6, 5)  +  Pr   (7, 1)  +  Pr   (7, 5)

Therefore, die A beats die B more than half of the time.  You had better not choose die B 
or else I’ll pick die A and have a better­than­even chance of winning the game!

2.1.2  Die B versus Die C 

Now suppose that die B is played against die C .  The tree diagram for this experiment is 
shown below.

13 

The analysis is the same as before and leads to the conclusion that die B  beats die C  with 
probability 5/9  as well.  Therefore, you had beter not choose die C ; if you do, I’ll pick die 
B  and most likely win! 

2.1.3  Die C versus Die A 

We’ve seen  that A  beats B  and B  beats C .  Apparently, die A  is  the best and die C  is  the 
worst. The result of a confrontation between A  and C  seems a forgone conclusion. A tree 
diagram for this ﬁnal experiment is worked out below. 

Surprisingly, die C  beats die A  with probability 5/9! 
In  summary,  die  A  beats  B ,  B  beats  C ,  and  C  beats  A!  Evidently,  there  is  a  relation 
between the dice that is not transitive!  This means that no matter what die the ﬁrst player 
chooses, the second player can choose a die that beats it with probability 5/9.  The player 
who picks ﬁrst is always at a disadvantage! 
Challenge:  The  dice  can  be  renumbered  so  that  A  beats  B  and  B  beats  C ,  each  with 
probability 2/3, and C  still beats A  with probability 5/9. Can you ﬁnd such a numbering?
