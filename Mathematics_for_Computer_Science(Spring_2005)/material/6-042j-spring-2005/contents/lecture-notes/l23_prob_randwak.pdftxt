Random Walks 

1  Random Walks 

A drunkard stumbles out of a bar.  Each second, he either staggers one step to the left or 
staggers one step to the right, with equal probability. His home lies x  steps to his left, and 
a canal lies y  steps to his right. This are several natural questions, including: 

1.  What  is  the  probability  that  the  drunkard  arrives  safely  at  home  instead  of  falling 
into the canal? 

2.  What is the expected duration of his journey, however it ends? 

The  drunkard’s meandering  path  is  called  a  random  walk.  Random walks  are  an  im­
portant subject, because  they can model such a wide array of phenomena.  For example, 
in  physics,  random  walks  in  three­dimensional  space  are  used  to  model  gas  diffusion. 
In computer science,  the Google search engine uses random walks  through  the graph of 
web  links  to  determine  the  relative  importance  of  websites.  In  ﬁnance  theory,  random 
walks can serve as a model for the ﬂuctuation of market prices. And, in this lecture, we’ll 
explore some more palatable applications. 

2  Pass the Candy 

Pass  the  Candy  is  game  involving  n  students,  one  professor,  and  a  bowl  of  candy.  The 
students  are  numbered  1  to  n,  and  the  professor  is  numbered  0.  Everyone  stands  in  a 
circle as shown below.

Random Walks 

Initially,  the professor  has  the  candy  bowl.  He withdraws  a piece  of  candy  and  then 
passes the bowl either left or right, with equal probability.  Each person who receives the 
bowl thereafter does the same thing:  he or she takes a piece of candy from the bowl and 
then  passes  it  either  left  or  right,  with  equal  probability.  In  effect,  the  bowl  goes  for  a 
random walk around  the  circle of players.  The  last person  to  receive a piece of  candy  is 
declared the winner and gets to keep the entire bowl. Which player is most likely to win? 
A natural guess is player n/2.  She seems most likely to receive the bowl last and thus 
to win the game, because she is farthest from the professor.  On the other hand, players 1 
and n seem almost certain to receive the bowl far too early in the process to win the game. 
Let’s see if this intuition is right or wrong! 

2.1  A Simpler Problem 

Let’s begin by  looking at a simpler problem.  Suppose  that  the players are arranged  in a 
line, rather than a circle: 

. . .  Sk  B 

A  S1  S2 
↑
candy 

The players are named A, S1 , S2 , . . ., Sk , and B , as shown.  Initially, player S1  has the candy 
bowl.  As before, whenever a player gets  the bowl,  he or  she  takes a piece of  candy and 
then passes  the  bowl  either  left  or  right, with  equal probability.  What  is  the probability 
that A gets candy before B ? 
Let Pk  be the probability that A gets candy before B .  First, suppose that k =  1: 

A  S1  B 
↑
candy 

Here, either A or B gets the bowl on the next step, with equal probability. Thus, P1  = 
.2
1
Now  suppose  that k  >  1.  In  the ﬁrst  step,  there are  two possibilities:  the bowl either 
moves left to player A or moves right to player S2 .  We can break up the evaluation of Pk 
into these two cases using the law of total probability: 

Pk  =  Pr (ﬁrst step is left)  
· Pr (A gets candy before B | ﬁrst step is left) 
+ Pr (ﬁrst step is right) 
· Pr (A gets candy before B | ﬁrst step is right)  
· 
· Pr (A gets candy before B | ﬁrst step is right)

To evaluate the last term, we must ﬁnd the probability that A gets candy before B starting 
from this conﬁguration: 

. . .  Sk  B 

A  S1  S2 
↑
candy 

This is a little tricky. From here, the candy must eventually reach either S1  or B .  In fact, we 
know that S1  gets the candy before B with probability Pk−1 .  (In effect, we are considering 
a  smaller version of  the problem,  in which S1  plays  the  role of A.)  If  this happens,  then 
we are back in the original conﬁguration, and so A goes on to get the candy before B with 
probability Pk .  Therefore, starting from the conﬁguration above, A gets the candy before 
· 
B with probability Pk−1  Pk .  Substituting this result into the equation above gives:

Solving for Pk  and adding in the base case gives a complete recurrence:

2.2  Solving the Recurrence Equation 

We  now  have  a  recurrence  for  Pk ,  the  probability  that  player  A  gets  the  candy  before 
player  B .  A  recurrence  is  good,  but  an  explicit  formula  for  Pk  would  be  better.  The 
simplest technique for obtaining an explicit formula from a recurrence is called guess and 
verify.  The name  says  it  all:  we  compute  a  few  terms,  guess a general pattern,  and  then 
verify the result. 

Let’s  apply  the  guess­and­verify  method  to  our  problem.  First,  we  compute  a  few 
terms using the recurrence:

Pk  = 

k 
k  + 1 

The general pattern appears to be: 

All that remains  is to verify that our guess  is correct.  We can use  induction on k  with 
the hypothesis that Pk  =  k/(k + 1). This holds for k  =  1, because P1  = 
is the base case of 
1
2 
the recurrence. Next, we assume Pk  =  k/(k  + 1) in order to prove Pk+1  =  (k  + 1)/(k  + 2). 
We can reason as follows: 

Pk+1  = 

= 

= 

1 
2 − Pk 
1 
2 −  k+1 
k
k  + 1 
k  + 2 

The ﬁrst step uses the recurrence equation, the second uses the induction hypothesis, and 
the third uses only algebra. Thus, by induction, Pk  =  k/(k  + 1) for all k  ≥ 1. 
Therefore, player A receives the candy before player B  with probability k/(k + 1). We’ll 
use this conclusion repeatedly in the next section. 

2.3  Analyzing the Game 

Now  let’s  return  to  the  original  problem.  There  are  n  players  and  a  professor  standing 
in  a  circle.  If  the professor has  the  candy  initially, which player  is most  likely  to get  the 
candy last and thus win the game? 

Random Walks

Let’s begin by considering player n, who is standing  just to the right of the professor. 
The only way that player n can win the game is if the bowl travels clockwise all the way 
around  the  circle  to  player  n − 1 before  n  ever  touches  it.  How  likely  is  that?  Let’s  get 
another  perspective  by  “cutting”  the  circle  between  players  n − 1 and  n  and  arranging 
them in a line: 

. . .  n − 2  n − 1 

n  0  1  2 
↑
candy 
We are asking for the probability that n − 1 gets candy before n.  But this  is precisely the 
problem that we already solved!  Here player n takes the role of A, player n − 1 takes the 
role  of  B ,  and  we  have  k  =  n − 1 players  between  them.  Therefore,  player  n  gets  the 
candy  before  player  n − 1 with  probability  (n − 1)/n.  In  complementary  terms,  player 
n − 1 gets the candy before player n with probability 1/n.  Thus, player n wins the game 
with probability 1/n. 
This  is  a  startling  conclusion!  At  the  beginning  of  lecture,  we  guessed  that  player  n 
had little chance of winning the game, because he was standing too close to the professor. 
But we’ve  just shown  that player n has a 1­in­n chance of winning.  Not bad,  since  there 
are n players! 
What are the winning chances for the other players?  By symmetry, player 1 also wins 
with probability 1/n.  So let’s consider the probability that player i wins the game, where 
1 < i < n. There are two cases:  either player i + 1 gets the bowl before player i − 1 or vice 
versa. Applying the law of total probability, we get: 

Pr (i wins)  =  Pr (i + 1 gets candy before i − 1) 
· Pr (i wins  i + 1 gets candy before i − 1)
|
+ Pr (i − 1 gets candy before i + 1)  
· Pr (i wins  i − 1 gets candy before i + 1)  
| 

Let’s begin by determining the probability that i wins, given that player i+1 gets candy 
before player  i − 1.  (This  is  the  second  line  in  the  formula.)  At  the moment  that player 
i + 1 ﬁrst gets candy, this must be the conﬁguration of the game: 
i − 1 

i + 1 
↑
candy 
Now  player  i wins  the  game  only  if  player  i − 1 gets  the  candy  before  player  i.  Again, 
we can invoke our earlier result.  Now i takes the role of A, i − 1 takes the role of B , and 
there are k =  n − 1 players between them. Therefore, player i gets the candy before player 

i 

. . .  n  0  1

i  − 1 with probability  (n  − 1)/n.  This means  that player  i  goes on  to win  the game with 
probability 1/n, given that i  + 1 gets candy before i  − 1. 
On  the  other  hand,  we  can  use  the  same  argument  to  show  that  player  i  wins  with 
probability  1/n,  given  that  player  i  − 1 gets  the  candy  before  player  i  + 1.  Substituting 
these results into the equation above gives: 

Pr (i  wins)  =  Pr (i  + 1 gets candy before i  − 1) · 
1 
n 
+ Pr (i  − 1 gets candy before i  + 1) · 
1 
n 
We  do  not  know  the  probability  that  player  i  + 1 gets  candy  before  player  i  − 1 or  vice 
versa,  but we do not need  to;  either way,  player  i  wins with probability  1/n.  Therefore, 
player i  wins with probability 1/n  overall. 
Amazingly,  every player  is equally  likely  to win Pass  the Candy,  regardless of where 
he or she stands!

3  Chocolate or Broccoli 

In  the Chocolate or Broccoli game, n  players are  immediately awarded chocolate bars and 
the remaining m  players are awarded broccoli.  But the game does not end there!  We ﬂip 
a  coin.  If  the  coin  is heads,  then  one player with  chocolate must  exchange her prize  for 
broccoli.  If  the  coin  is  tails,  then  a  player  with  broccoli  must  exchange  her  prize  for  a 
chocolate  bar.  This process  of  coin­ﬂipping  and prize­exchanging  continues until  either 
all  the players have chocolate or all  the players have broccoli.  At  that point,  the players 
can take their prizes home. How long does the game last? 
Let the random variable Tc,b  be the length of the game if c  players have chocolate and 
b  players have broccoli.  If either variable is zero, then the length of the game is also zero: 

Tc,0  = 0 
T0,b  = 0 

Otherwise, we ﬂip a coin and a prize is exchanged, expending one unit of time. There are 
now two possibilities: 
1.  With probability  1 , there are c  − 1 chocolate bars and b   + 1 broccolis. 
2
2.  With probability  1 , there are c  + 1 chocolate bars and b   − 1 broccolis.

The total duration of the game is 1 (to ﬂip the coin and exchange one prize) plus the length 
of the rest of the game, which we can express using the law of total expectation: 

Ex (Tc,b )  = 1 +

· Ex (Tc−1,b+1 ) + 

· Ex (Tc+1,b−1 )

Now we have a recurrence equation for the expected duration of the game.  But this is 
not  a very  satisfying  answer;  even with  the  recurrence  in hand,  there  is  still no  obvious 
way to compute, say, T3,1 .  We can still apply a form of guess and verify, however.  In this 
case, we might need to use simulation results as the basis for a guess: 

Ex (Tc,b ) =  cb 

We can then verify that this is a solution to the recurrence by plugging our guess into the 
right side and showing that we get the left side.

(There is a technical consideration that we are leaving aside: we have not shown that this 
solution is unique.) 

3.1  An Surprising Implication 

Suppose that you have $1 and I have $1,000,000. We repeatedly make fair $1 bets. What is 
the expected number of bets until one or the other of us goes broke?  Intuitively, it seems 
that  the  game  should  be  rather  short,  since  there  is  a  half­chance  that  you  go  bankrupt 
after  just one bet.  However,  this is equivalent to playing the Chocolate or Broccoli game 
where 1 player starts with chocolate and a million players start with broccoli.  Therefore, 
the expected number of bets is actually a million!
