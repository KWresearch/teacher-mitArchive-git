Induction I 

1  Induction 

A professor brings to class a bottomless bag of assorted miniature candy bars.  She offers 
to  share  in  accordance with  two  rules.  First,  she numbers  the  students  0,  1,  2,  3,  and  so 
forth for convenient reference. Now here are the two rules: 

1.  Student 0 gets candy. 
2.  For all n  ∈ N, if student n  gets candy, then student n  +  1  also gets candy. 

You can think of the second rule as a compact way of writing a whole sequence of state­
ments, one for each natural value of n: 

•  If student 0 gets candy, then student 1 also gets candy. 

•  If student 1 gets candy, then student 2 also gets candy. 

•  If student 2 gets candy, then student 3 also gets candy, and so forth. 

Now suppose you are student 17. By these rules, are you entitled to a miniature candy 
bar?  Well,  student  0  gets  candy  by  the ﬁrst  rule.  Therefore,  by  the  second  rule,  student 
1 also gets candy, which means student 2 gets candy as well, which means student 3 get 
candy, and so on.  So the professor ’s two rules actually guarantee candy for every student, 
no matter how large the class. You win! 
This reasoning generalizes to a principle called induction: 

Principle of Induction. Let P (n) be a predicate.  If 

•  P (0) is true, and 
•  for all n  ∈ N, P (n) implies P (n   +  1), 

then P (n) is true for all n  ∈ N. 

2	

Induction I 

Here’s  the  correspondence  between  the  induction  principle  and  sharing  candy  bars. 
Suppose that P (n) is the predicate, “student n gets candy”. Then the professor ’s ﬁrst rule 
asserts that P (0) is true, and her second rule  is that for all n  ∈  N, P (n) implies P (n + 1). 
Given  these  facts,  the  induction  principle  says  that  P (n) is  true  for  all  n  ∈  N.  In  other 
words, everyone gets candy. 
The  intuitive  justiﬁcation for  the general  induction principle  is the same as for every­
one getting a  candy bar under  the professor ’s  two  rules.  Mathematicians ﬁnd  this  intu­
ition so compelling that induction is always either taken as an axiom or else proved from 
more  primitive  axioms,  which  are  themselves  speciﬁcally  designed  so  that  induction  is 
provable.  In any case, the induction principle is a core principle of mathematics. 

2  Using Induction 

Induction  is  by  far  the most  important  proof  technique  in  computer  science.  Generally, 
induction is used to prove that some statement holds for all natural values of a variable. 
For example, here is a classic formula: 
Theorem 1.  For all n ∈ N: 

1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + n = 

n(n + 1)  
2 

The left side of the equation represents the sum of all the numbers from 1 to n.  You’re 
supposed to guess the pattern and mentally replace the . . . with the other terms. We could 
� 
�	
� 
eliminate the need for guessing by rewriting the left side with summation notation: 
n
i 
1≤i≤n
i∈{1,...,n} 
i=1  

or 

i 

or 

i 

Each  of  these  expressions  denotes  the  sum  of  all  values  taken  on  by  the  expression  to 
the  right  of  the  sigma  as  the  variable  i ranges  from  1  to  n.  The meaning  of  the  sum  in 
Theorem 1 is not so obvious in a couple special cases: 

•	 If n =  1, then there is only one term in the summation, and so 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + n =  1. 
Don’t  be misled  by  the  appearance  of  2  and  3  and  the  suggestion  that  1 and  n  are 
distinct terms! 
•	 If n ≤ 0, then there are no terms at all in the summation, and so 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + n =  0. 

The . . . notation is convenient, but watch out for these special cases where the notation is 
misleading! 
Now  let’s  use  the  induction  principle  to  prove  Theorem  1.  Suppose  that  we  deﬁne 
predicate P (n) to be “1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + n =  n(n + 1)/2”.  Recast in terms of this predicate, 
the  theorem  claims  that  P (n) is  true  for  all  n  ∈  N.  This  is  great,  because  the  induction 
principle lets us reach precisely that conclusion, provided we establish two simpler facts: 

Induction I	

•	 P (0) is true. 
•	 For all n ∈ N, P (n) implies P (n +  1). 

3 

So  now  our  job  is  reduced  to proving  these  two  statements.  The ﬁrst  is  true  because 
P (0) asserts that a sum of zero terms is equal to 0(0  +  1)/2  = 0. 
The  second  statement  is  more  complicated.  But  remember  the  basic  plan  for  prov­
ing  the  validity  of  any  implication:  assume  the  statement  on  the  left  and  then  prove  the 
statement on the right.  In this case, we assume P (n): 

1  +  2   +  3  +  . . . +  n = 

n(n +  1)  
2 

in order to prove P (n +  1): 

(n +  1)(n +  2)  
2 
These  two  equations  are  quite  similar;  in  fact,  adding  (n  +  1)  to  both  sides  of  the  ﬁrst 
equation and simplifying the right side gives the second equation: 

1  +  2   +  3   +  . . . +  n +  (n +  1) = 

+  (n +  1)  

= 

1  +  2   +  3   +  . . . +  n +  (n +  1) = 

n(n +  1)  
2 
(n +  2)(n +  1)  
2 
Thus, if P (n) is true, then so is P (n +  1). This argument is valid for every natural number 
n, so this establishes the second fact required by the induction principle.  In effect, we’ve 
just  proved  that  P (0)  implies  P (1),  P (1)   implies  P (2),  P (2)   implies  P (3),  etc.  all  in  one 
fell swoop. 
With  these  two  facts  in  hand,  the  induction  principle  says  that  the  predicate  P (n)  is 
true for all natural n. And so the theorem is proved! 

2.1  A Template for Induction Proofs 

The proof of Theorem 1 was relatively simple, but even  the most complicated  induction 
proof follows exactly the same template. There are ﬁve components: 

1.	 State that the proof uses induction. This immediately conveys the overall structure 
of the proof, which helps the reader understand your argument. 

2.	 Deﬁne  an  appropriate  predicate  P (n).  The  eventual  conclusion  of  the  induction 
argument  will  be  that  P (n)  is  true  for  all  natural  n.  Thus,  you  should  deﬁne  the 
predicate P (n)  so  that your  theorem  is equivalent  to  (or  follows  from)  this  conclu­
sion.  Often  the  predicate  can  be  lifted  straight  from  the  claim,  as  in  the  example 
above. The predicate P (n) is called the “induction hypothesis”. 

4	

Induction I 

3.	 Prove  that P (0)  is  true.  This  is usually easy,  as  in  the example above.  This part of 
the proof is called the “base case” or “basis step”. 

4.	 Prove  that  P (n)  implies  P (n +  1)  for  every  natural  number  n.  This  is  called  the 
“inductive  step”  or  “induction  step”.  The  basic  plan  is  always  the  same:  assume 
that P (n) is true and then use this assumption to prove that P (n +  1)   is true.  These 
two  statements  should  be  fairly  similar,  but  bridging  the  gap  may  require  some 
ingenuity.  Whatever argument you give must be valid for every natural number n, 
since the goal is to prove the implications P (0)   → P (1), P (1)   → P (2), P (2)   → P (3), 
etc.  all at once. 

5.	 Invoke induction. Given these facts, the induction principle allows you to conclude 
that P (n) is true for all natural n. This is the logical capstone to the whole argument, 
but many writers leave this step implicit. 

Explicitly labeling the base case and inductive step may make your proofs more clear. 

2.2  A Clean Writeup 

The proof of Theorem 1 given above is perfectly valid; however, it contains a lot of extra­
neous explanation  that you won’t usually see  in  induction proofs.  The writeup below  is 
closer to what you might see in print and should be prepared to produce yourself. 

Proof.  We use induction. Let P (n) be the predicate: 

1  +  2   +  3  +  . . . +  n = 

n(n +  1)  
2 

Base case: P (0) is true, because both sides of the equation are zero. 
Inductive step: Assume that P (n) is true, where n is any natural number.  Then P (n +  1) is 
also true, because: 

1  +  2   +  3  +  . . . +  n +  (n +  1) = 

= 

+  (n +  1)  

n(n +  1)  
2 
(n +  1)(n +  2)  
2 

The ﬁrst step uses the assumption P (n), and the second follows by simpliﬁcation. There­
fore, P (n) is true for all natural n by induction. 

Induction  was  helpful  for  proving  the  correctness  of  this  summation  formula,  but  not 
helpful  for  discovering  the  formula  in  the  ﬁrst  place.  There  are  some  tricks  for  ﬁnding 
such formulas, which we’ll show you in a few weeks. 

Induction I 
3  A Divisibility Theorem 
An integer a  divides an integer b  if b  is a multiple of a.  This is denoted a  | b.  For example, 
|
(53  − 5),  since 53  − 5  =  120  is a multiple of 3.  More generally, we have  the  following 
3 
theorem: 
Theorem 2.  ∀ n  ∈ N  3 (n3  − n)
| 

5 

Let’s try to prove this with induction.  The ﬁrst challenge is always selecting the right 
induction hypothesis, P (n).  Your ﬁrst  instinct should be  to  lift  the  induction hypothesis 
directly from the claim. Thus, in this case, we should ﬁrst try letting P (n) be the predicate 
“3 (n3  − n)”.  (This doesn’t always work out – as we’ll see in a later example – but it does 
|
work in this case.) 
Now we must address the base case by proving that P (0) is true.  As is often the case, 
|
(03  − 0), since 0 is a multiple of 3.  (Speciﬁcally, 3 0  = 0.)
· 
this is easy:  3 
Our  next  task,  the  inductive  step,  is  typically  the most  difﬁcult  part  of  an  induction 
proof. We must show that P (n) implies P (n   +  1).  Thus, as usual when proving an impli­
cation, we assume P (n) in order to prove P (n   + 1). Writing out what these two expressions 
actually mean is often helpful.  In this case, we assume P (n): 
3 (n 3  − n)
| 

in order to prove P (n  +  1): 

((n   +  1)3  − (n  +  1)) 
| 
These  two  statements  look  somewhat  similar,  but how  can we use  the ﬁrst  to prove  the 
second?  For lack of any other ideas, let’s multiply out the expression in the second state­
ment: 

3 

|

3 

((n  +  1)3  − (n  +  1))   ⇔ 3 (n 3  +  3n 2  +  3n  +  1  − n  − 1)
|
3  | (n  3  +  3n 2  +  2n)
⇔ 

Aha!  Notice  that  the  last expression  is equal  to n − n  plus 3n2  +  3n.  Since 3n2  +  3n  is a 
3
multiple of 3 and n − n  is a multiple of 3 by the assumption P (n), their sum must also be 
3
a multiple of 3. Therefore, ((n  +  1)3  − (n  +  1) is a multiple of 3. 
Playing around with P (n) and P (n  +  1)   in this way, trying to understand how the two 
are related, is pretty typical when one is searching for an induction argument.  However, 
what we’ve done so  far  is only scratchwork.  What  remains  is  to organize our  reasoning 
into a clear proof. 
Proof.  We use induction. Let P (n) be the proposition that 3 (n3  − n).
| 
Base case: P (0) is true because 3   | 03  − 0. 

6 

Induction I 

Inductive step: Assume that P (n) is true, where n is any natural number. Then: 
3 (n 3  − n)  ⇒ 3 (n 3  − n) +  3(n  +  n)
|
| 
2
⇒ 3  n 3  +  3n 2  +  3n +  1  − n − 1
| 
⇒ 3 (n +  1)3  − (n +  1)  
| 

The  ﬁrst  implication  relies  on  the  fact  that  3(n2  +  n)  is  divisible  by  3.  The  remaining 
implications  involve  only  rewriting  the  expression  on  the  right.  The  last  statement  is 
P (n +  1), so we’ve proved that P (n) implies P (n +  1) for all n ∈ N. 
By the principle of induction, P (n) is true for all n ∈ N, which proves the claim. 

This proof would look quite mysterious to anyone not privy to the scratchwork we did 
beforehand.  In particular, one might ask how we had the foresight to introduce the magic 
term 3(n2  + n). Of course, this was not foresight at all; we just worked backward initially! 

4  A Faulty Induction Proof 
Sometimes  we  want  to  prove  that  a  statement  is  true  for,  say,  all  integers  n ≥  1  rather 
than all  integers n ≥  0.  In  this circumstance, we can use a slight variation on  induction: 
prove P (1) in the base case and then prove that P (n) implies P (n +  1)  for all n ≥ 1  in the 
inductive step.  This  is a perfectly valid variant of  induction and  is not  the problem with 
the proof below. 

False Theorem 3.  All horses are the same color. 

Proof.  The proof is by induction. Let P (n) be the proposition that in every set of n horses, 
all are the same color. 
Base case: P (1) is true, because all horses in a set of 1 must be the same color. 
Inductive step: Assume that P (n) is true, where n is a positive integer; that is, assume that 
in every set of n horses, all are the same color. Now consider a set of n +  1  horses: 

h1 , h2 , . . . , hn , hn+1 
By our assumption, the ﬁrst n horses are the same color: 
�� 
� 
� 
h1 , h2 , . . . , hn , hn+1 
same color 
Also by our assumption, the last n horses are the same color: 
� 
� 
�� 
h1 , h2 , . . . , hn , hn+1 
same color 

Induction I 

7 

Therefore, horses h1 ,  h2 , .   .   .   ,  hn+1  must all be the same color, and so P (n   + 1)  is true. Thus, 
P (n) implies P (n  +  1). 
By  the principle of  induction, P (n)   is  true  for all n  ≥  1.  The  theorem  is a special case 
where n  is equal to the number of horses in the world. 

We’ve proved something false!  Is math broken?  Should we all become poets? 
The error in this argument is in the sentence that begins, “Therefore, horses h1 , h2 , .  .  ., 
hn ,  hn+1  must  all  be  the  same  color.”  The  “.  .  .”  notation  creates  the  impression  that  the 
sets h1 ,  h2 , .  .  .  ,  hn  and h2 , .  .   .   ,   hn ,  hn+1  overlap.  However,  this  is not  true when n  = 1.  In 
that case, the ﬁrst set is just h1  and the second is h2 , and these do not overlap at all! 
This mistake knocks a critical link out of our induction argument. We proved P (1) and 
we proved P (2)  ⇒  P (3), P (3)  ⇒  P (4),  etc.  But we  failed  to prove P (1)   ⇒  P (2),  and so 
everything falls apart:  we can not conclude that P (3), P (4), etc.  are true.  And, of course, 
these propositions are all false; there are horses of a different color. 

5  Courtyard Tiling 

Induction  served purely  as  a proof  technique  in  the preceding  examples.  But  induction 
sometimes can serve as a more general reasoning tool. 
MIT recently constructed a new computer science building. As the project went further 
and  further  over  budget,  there  were  some  radical  fundraising  ideas.  One  plan  was  to 
install a big courtyard with dimensions 2n  × 2n : 

2n 

2n 

One  of  the  central  squares would  be  occupied  by  a  statue  of  a wealthy  potential  donor. 
Let’s  call him  “Bill”.  (In  the  special  case n  = 0,  the whole  courtyard  consists of  a  single 
central  square;  otherwise,  there  are  four  central  squares.)  A  complication  was  that  the 
building’s unconventional architect, Frank Gehry, insisted that only special L­shaped tiles 
be used: 

8 

Induction I 

A courtyard meeting these constraints exsists, at least for n  = 2: 

B 

For larger values of n, is there a way to tile a 2n  × 2n  courtyard with L­shaped tiles and a 
statue in the center? Let’s try to prove that this is so. 
Theorem 4.  For all n  ≥ 0  there exists a tiling of a 2n  × 2n  courtyard with Bill in a central square. 

Proof.  (doomed attempt) The proof  is by  induction.  Let P (n)  be  the proposition  that  there 
exists a tiling of a 2n  × 2n  courtyard with Bill in the center. 
Base case: P (0) is true because Bill ﬁlls the whole courtyard. 
Inductive  step:  Assume  that  there  is a  tiling of a 2n  × 2n  courtyard with Bill  in  the  center 
for some n  ≥ 0. We must prove that there is a way to tile a 2n+1  × 2n+1  courtyard with Bill 
in the center... 

Now we’re in trouble! The ability to tile a smaller courtyard with Bill in the center does 
not help tile a larger courtyard with Bill in the center. We can not bridge the gap between 
P (n) and P (n  +  1). The usual recipe for ﬁnding an inductive proof will not work! 
When  this  happens,  your  ﬁrst  fallback  should  be  to  look  for  a  stronger  induction  hy­
pothesis;  that  is,  one  which  implies  your  previous  hypothesis.  For  example,  we  could 
make P (n) the proposition that for every location of Bill in a 2n  × 2n  courtyard, there exists 
a tiling of the remainder. 
This advice may sound bizzare: “If you can’t prove something, try to prove something 
more grand!” But for induction arguments, this makes sense.  In the inductive step, where 
you have to prove P (n)  ⇒ P (n  +  1), you’re in better shape because you can assume P (n), 
which  is now a more general, more useful statement.  Let’s see how this plays out  in the 
case of courtyard tiling. 

Proof.  (successful attempt) The proof  is by  induction.  Let P (n)  be  the proposition  that  for 
every location of Bill in a 2n  × 2n  courtyard, there exists a tiling of the remainder. 
Base case: P (0) is true because Bill ﬁlls the whole courtyard. 
Inductive step: Asume that P (n) is true for some n  ≥ 0; that is, for every location of Bill in 
a 2n  × 2n  courtyard, there exists a tiling of the remainder. Divide the 2n+1  × 2n+1  courtyard 
into  four quadrants,  each 2n  × 2n  .  One quadrant contains Bill  (B  in  the diagram below). 
Place a temporary Bill (X in the diagram) in each of the three central squares lying outside 
this quadrant: 

Induction I

2n 

B

2n 

2n 

Now we can tile each of the four quadrants by the  induction assumption.  Replacing the 
three temporary Bills with a single L­shaped tile completes the job. This proves that P (n) 
implies P (n  +  1) for all n  ≥ 0. The theorem follows as a special case. 

This proof has  two nice properties.  First,  not  only does  the  argument  guarantee  that 
a  tiling  exists,  but  also  it  gives  an  algorithm  for  ﬁnding  such  a  tiling.  Second,  we  have 
a  stronger  result:  if  Bill  wanted  a  statue  on  the  edge  of  the  courtyard,  away  from  the 
pigeons, we could accommodate him! 
Strengthening the induction hypothesis is often a good move when an induction proof 
won’t  go  through.  But  keep  in  mind  that  the  stronger  assertion  must  actually  be  true; 
otherwise, there isn’t much hope of constructing a valid proof! Sometimes ﬁnding just the 
right induction hypothesis requires trial, error, and insight. For example, mathematicians 
spent almost  twenty years  trying  to prove or disprove  the conjecture  that “Every planar 
graph is 5­choosable”1 . Then, in 1994, Carsten Thomassen gave an induction proof simple 
enough  to  explain  on  a  napkin.  The  key  turned  out  to  be  ﬁnding  an  extremely  clever 
induction hypothesis; with that in hand, completing the argument is easy! 

15­choosability  is  a  slight  generalization  of  5­colorability.  Although  every  planar  graph  is  4­colorable 
and  therefore  5­colorable,  not  every  planar  graph  is  4­choosable.  If  this  all  sounds  like  nonsense,  don’t 
panic. We’ll discuss graphs, planarity, and coloring in two weeks.
