Counting II 
We  realize  everyone has  been working pretty hard  this  term1 ,  and we’re  considering 
awarding some prizes for truly exceptional coursework. Here are some possible categories: 

Best Administrative Critique  We asserted  that  the quiz was  closed­book.  On  the  cover 
page, one strong candidate for this award wrote, “There is no book.” 

Best Collaboration Statement  Inspired  by  the  student who wrote  “I worked  alone”  on 
quiz 1. 

Olfactory Fixation Award  A surprisingly competitive category this term, this goes to the 
student who  comes up with  the greatest number of odor­related mathematical  ex­
amples. 

We also considered some less ﬂattering categories such as Proof Most Likely Readable 
from the Surface of the Moon, Solution Most Closely Resembling a Football Play Diagram 
with Good Yardage Potential, etc.  But  then we realized that you all might think up sim­
ilar  “awards”  for  the  course  staff  and  decided  to  turn  the whole matter  into  a  counting 
problem.  In how many ways can, say, three different prizes be awarded to n  people? 
Remember our basic strategy for counting: 

1.  Learn to count sequences. 

2.  Translate everything else into a sequence­counting problem via bijections. 

We’ll  ﬂesh  out  this  strategy  considerably  today,  but  the  rough  outline  above  is  good 
enough for now. 
So  we  ﬁrst  need  to  ﬁnd  a  bijection  that  translates  the  problem  about  awards  into  a 
problem about sequences.  Let P  be the set of n  people  in 6.042.  Then there  is a bijection 
from ways of awarding the three prizes to the set P × P × P .  In particular, the assignment: 
“person x  wins prize #1, y  wins prize #2, and z  wins prize #3” 

maps to the sequence (x,   y , z ). All that remains is to count these sequences. By the Product 
Rule, we have: 

P  × P  × P
|

|

| · |
P

| · |
P

=  n 

Thus, there are n3  ways to award the prizes to a class of n  people.

1  The Generalized Product Rule 

Counting II 

What if the three prizes must be awarded to different students?  As before, we could map 
the assignment 

“person x  wins prize #1, y  wins prize #2, and z  wins prize #3” 
to  the  triple  (x,   y , z )  ∈  P  × P  × P .  But  this  function  is no  longer a bijection.  For example, 
no valid assignment maps to the triple (Dave, Dave, Becky) because Dave is not allowed 
to receive two awards. However, there is a bijection from prize assignments to the set: 
S  =  {(x,   y , z ) ∈ P  × P  × P x, y , and z  are different people}
| 

This reduces the original problem to a problem of counting sequences. Unfortunately, the 
Product Rule is of no help in counting sequences of this type because the entries depend 
on one another; in particular, they must all be different.  However, a slightly sharper tool 
does the trick. 

Rule 1 (Generalized Product Rule).  Let S  be a set of length­k  sequences.  If there are: 

•  n1  possible ﬁrst entries, 

•  n2  possible second entries for each ﬁrst entry, 

•  n3  possible third entries for each combination of ﬁrst and second entries, etc. 

then: 

|
| 
S =  n1 

· n2  · n3  · · ·

nk

In the awards example, S  consists of sequences (x,  y , z ).  There are n  ways to choose x, 
the recipient of prize #1.  For each of these, there are n  − 1  ways to choose y , the recipient 
of prize #2, since everyone except for person x  is eligible.  For each combination of x  and 
y , there are n  − 2  ways to choose z , the recipient of prize #3, because everyone except for 
x  and y  is eligible. Thus, according to the Generalized Product Rule, there are 
S =  n  · (n   − 1)  · (n   − 2)
|

ways to award the 3 prizes to different people. 

1.1  Defective Dollars 

A dollar is defective some digit appears more than once in the 8­digit serial number.  If you 
check  your  wallet,  you’ll  be  sad  to  discover  that  defective  dollars  are  all­too­common. 

Counting II 

3 

In  fact, how common are nondefective dollars?  Assuming  that  the digit portions of serial 
numbers all occur equally often, we could answer this question by computing: 

fraction dollars that are nondefective = 

# of serial #’s with all digits different 
total # of serial #’s 

Let’s ﬁrst consider the denominator. Here there are no restrictions; there are are 10 possi­
ble ﬁrst digits, 10 possible second digits, 10 third digits, and so on. Thus, the total number 
of 8­digit serial numbers is 108  by the Generalized Product Rule.  (Alternatively, you could 
conclude this using the ordinary Product Rule; however, the Generalized Product Rule is 
strictly more  powerful.  So  you might  as well  forget  the  orignial  Product Rule  now  and 
free up some brain space for 6.002.) 
Next, let’s turn to the numerator.  Now we’re not permitted to use any digit twice.  So 
there  are  still  10  possible  ﬁrst  digits,  but  only  9  possible  second  digits,  8  possible  third 
digits, and so forth. Thus there are 

10   · 9 8 7 6 5 4 3  = 
·
·
·
·
·
· 
10!  
2 
= 1,  814,  400 

serial  numbers with  all  digits  different.  Plugging  these  results  into  the  equation  above, 
we ﬁnd: 

fraction dollars that are nondefective = 

1,  814,  400 
100,  000,  000 
= 1.8144% 

1.2  A Chess Problem 

In  how many  different ways  can we  place  a  pawn  (p),  a  knight  (k ),  and  a  bishop  (b)  on 
a  chessboard  so  that  no  two  pieces  share  a  row  or  a  column?  A  valid  conﬁguration  is 
shown below on the the left, and an invalid conﬁguration is shown on the right.

Counting II 

First, we map  this problem about chess pieces  to a question about sequences.  There  is a 
bijection from conﬁgurations to sequences 

(rp , cp , rk , ck , rb , cb ) 

where rp , rk , and rb  are distinct rows and cp , ck , and cb  are distinct columns.  In particular, 
rp  is  the  pawn’s  row,  cp  is  the  pawn’s  column,  rk  is  the  knight’s  row,  etc.  Now  we  can 
count the number of such sequences using the Generalized Product Rule: 

• rp  is one of 8 rows 
• 
cp  is one of 8 columns 
• rk  is one of 7 rows (any one but rp ) 
• ck  is one of 7 columns (any one but cp ) 
• rb  is one of 6 rows (any one but rp  or rk ) 
• cb  is one of 6 columns (any one but cp  or ck ) 

Thus, the total number of conﬁgurations is (8  7  · 6)2  .
·

1.3  Permutations 

A permutation of a set S is a sequence that contains every element of S exactly once.  For 
example, here are all the permutations of the set {a, b, c}: 

(a, b, c) 
(b, c, a)  

(a, c, b) 
(c, a, b) 

(b, a, c) 
(c, b, a) 

How many permutations of an n­element set are there? Well, there are n choices for the 
ﬁrst element.  For each of these, there are n − 1  remaining choices for the second element. 
For every combination of the ﬁrst two elements, there are n − 2  ways to choose the third 
element, and so forth. Thus, there are a total of 
· · ·
n · (n − 1)  · (n − 2) 

·
·
3 2 1 =  n!

permutations  of  an  n­element  set.  In  particular,  this  formula  says  that  there  are  3!  = 6 
permuations of the 3­element set {a, b, c}, which is the number we found above. 
Permutations will come up again  in  this  course approximately 1.6 bazillion  times.  In 
� �
fact, permutations are the reason why factorial comes up so often and why we taught you 
Stirling’s approximation:

Counting II 
2  The Division Rule 

5 

We can count the number of people in a room by counting ears and dividing by two.  Or 
we could count  the number of ﬁngers and divide by 10.  Or we could count  the number 
of ﬁngers and toes and divide by 20.  (Someone is probably short a ﬁnger or has an extra 
ear,  but  let’s  not worry  about  that  right  now.)  These  observations  lead  to  an  important 
counting rule. 

A k­to­1 function maps exactly k  elements of the domain to every element of the range. 
For example, the function mapping each ear to its owner is 2­to­1: 

person A 

-
ear 1 
3
 PPPPPP
ear 2 
 
q  person B 
ear 3 

�
�
ear 4 
PPPPPP
� 
q person C 
� -
ear 5 
� 
ear 6 � 

Similarly,  the  function  mapping  each  ﬁnger  to  its  owner  is  10­to­1.  And  the  function 
maping each each ﬁnger or toe to its owner is 20­to­1. Now just as a bijection implies two 
sets are the same size, a k ­to­1 function implies that the domain is k  times larger than the 
domain: 
Rule 2 (Division Rule).  If f  :  A  → B  is k ­to­1, then |A =  k B |.
| 
· |

Suppose  A  is  the  set  of  ears  in  the  room  and  B  is  the  set  of  people.  Since  we  know 
there is a 2­to­1 mapping from ears to people, the Division Rule says that |A = 2  B | or, 
| 
· |
equivalently, |B =  A /2. Thus, the number of people is half the number of ears. 
| 
|
| 
Now this might seem like a stupid way to count people. But, surprisingly, many count­
ing problems are made much  easier by  initially  counting  every  item multiple  times and 
then correcting the answer using the Division Rule. Let’s look at some examples. 

2.1  Another Chess Problem 

In  how many  different ways  can  you  place  two  identical  rooks  on  a  chessboard  so  that 
they do not share a row or column? A valid conﬁguration is shown below on the left, and 

6 

Counting II 

an invalid conﬁguration is shown on the right. 

r 

r 

valid 

Let A be the set of all sequences 

r 

r 

invalid 

(8, 8, 1, 1) 

(r1 , c1 , r2 , c2 ) 
where r1  and r2  are distinct rows and c1  and c2  are distinct columns. Let B be the set of all 
valid rook conﬁgurations.  There is a natural function f  from set A to set B ; in particular, 
f  maps  the  sequence  (r1 , c1 , r2 , c2 )  to a conﬁguration with one  rook  in  row  r1 ,  column  c1 
and the other rook in row r2 , column c2 . 
But now there’s a snag. Consider the sequences: 
and 
The ﬁrst sequence maps to a conﬁguration with a rook in the lower­left corner and a rook 
in the upper­right corner. The second sequence maps to a conﬁguration with a rook in the 
upper­right corner and a rook in the lower­left corner.  The problem is that those are two 
different ways of describing the same conﬁguration!  In fact, this arrangement is shown on 
the left side in the diagram above. 
More generally, the function f map exactly two sequences to every board conﬁguration; 
that is f  is a 2­to­1 function.  Thus, by the quotient rule,  |A = 2  · |B .  Rearranging terms 
|
|
gives: 

|A|
2 
(8  · 7)2

On the second line, we’ve computed the size of A using the General Product Rule just as 
in the earlier chess problem.

2.2  Knights of the Round Table 

In  how  many  ways  can  King  Arthur  seat  n  different  knights  at  his  round  table?  Two 
seatings are considered equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by rotation.  For 
example, the following two arrangements are equivalent: 

Counting II

# k1
"!
k2
k3

k4

# k3
"!
k4
k1

k2

7

Let A be all the permutations of the knights, and let B be the set of all possible seating
arrangements at the round table. We can map each permutaton in set A to a circular
seating arrangement in set B by seating the ﬁrst knight in the permutation anywhere,
putting the second knight to his left, the third knight to the left of the second, and so forth
all the way around the table. For example:
# k2
(k2 , k4 , k1 , k3 ) ⇒ "!
k4
k3
k1

This mapping is actually an n-to-1 function from A to B , since all n cyclic shifts of the
original sequence map to the same seating arrangement. In the example, n = 4 different
sequences map to the same seating arranement:
# k2
⇒ "!
k3
k4
k1

(k2 , k4 , k1 , k3 )
(k4 , k1 , k3 , k2 )
(k1 , k3 , k2 , k4 )
(k3 , k2 , k4 , k1 )

Therefore, by the division rule, the number of circular seating arrangements is:
|A|
|B | =
n
n!
=
n
= (n − 1)!
Note that |A| = n! since there are n! permutations of n knights.

3 Inclusion-Exclusion

How big is a union of sets? For example, suppose there are 60 Math majors, 200 EECS
majors, and 40 Physics majors. How many students are there in these three departments?

8 

Counting II 

Let M  be the set of Math majors, E  be the set of EECS majors, and P  be the set of Physics 
majors.  In these terms, we’re asking for  M  ∪ E  ∪ P .
|
|
The Sum Rule says that the size of union of disjoint sets is the sum of their sizes: 
| 
M  ∪ E  ∪ P =  M | + E + P
|
|
|
|
|
|

(if M , E , and P  are disjoint) 

However,  the  sets  M ,  E ,  and  P  might  not  be  disjoint.  For  example,  there  might  be  a 
student majoring  in both Math and Physics.  Such a  student would be  counted  twice on 
the  right  sides  of  this  equation,  once  as  an  element  of M  and  once  as  an  element  of  P . 
Worse, there might be a triple­major counting three times on the right side! 
Our  last  counting  rule  determines  the  size  of  a  union  of  sets  that  are  not  necessarily 
disjoint.  Before we  state  the  rule,  let’s  build  some  intuition  by  considering  some  easier 
special cases: unions of just two or three sets. 

3.1  Union of Two Sets 

For two sets, S1  and S2 , the size of the union is given by the following equation: 
S1  ∪ S2 =  S1 | + S2
|
|
|
|
| − |
S1  ∩ S2
| 

(1)

Intuitively, each element of S1  is accounted for in the ﬁrst term, and each element of S2  is 
accounted for in the second term.  Elements in both S1  and S2  are counted twice— once in 
the ﬁrst term and once in the second. This double­counting is corrected by the ﬁnal term. 
We can prove equation (1) rigorously by applying the Sum Rule to some disjoint sub­
sets of S1  ∪ S2 . As a ﬁrst step, we observe that given any two sets, S,  T , we can decompose 
S  into the disjoint sets consisting of those elements in S  but not T , and those elements in 
S  and also in T . That is, S  is the union of the disjoint sets S  − T  and S  ∩ T .  So by the Sum 
Rule we have 

|S | =  |S  − T | + |S  ∩ T | , 
|S  − T | =  |S | − |S  ∩ T | . 
Now we decompose S1  ∪ S2  into three disjoint sets: 
S1  ∪ S2  =  (S1  − S2 ) ∪ (S2  − S1 ) ∪ (S1  ∩ S2 ).  

and so 

(2) 

(3) 

Now we have 
S1  ∪ S2 = (S1  − S2 ) ∪ (S2  − S1 ) ∪ (S1  ∩ S2 )
|

=  S1  − S2 + S2  − S1 + S1  ∩ S2

3.2  Union of Three Sets 

9 

So how many  students are  there  in  the Math, EECS, and Physics departments?  In other 
words, what is  M ∪ E ∪ P if:
|
| 


M | =  60

|
E | =  200 
|
|
| 
P =  40 
The size of a union of three sets is given by a more complicated formula: 
S1  ∪ S2  ∪ S3 =  S1 | + S2 + S3
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
S1  ∩ S3
− |
S1  ∩ S2
| − |
+ S1  ∩ S2  ∩ S3
| 
|
Remarkably, the expression on the right accounts for each element in the the union of S1 , 
S2 , and S3  exactly once. For example, suppose that x is an element of all three sets. Then x 
is counted three times (by the |S1 ,  S2 , and  S3 terms), subtracted off three times (by the 
| |
|
|
|
S1  ∩ S2 ,  S1  ∩ S3 , and  S2  ∩ S3 terms), and then counted once more (by the  S1  ∩ S2  ∩ S3
|
|
| |
|
|
| 
|
term). The net effect is that x is counted just once. 
So  we  can’t  answer  the  original  question  without  knowing  the  sizes  of  the  various 
intersections. Let’s suppose that there are: 

S2  ∩ S3
| − |

| 

4  Math ­ EECS double majors 
3  Math ­ Physics double majors 
11  EECS ­ Physics double majors 
triple majors 
2 
Then  M ∩ E =  4 + 2,  M ∩ P =  3 + 2,  E ∩ P =  11 + 2, and  M ∩ E ∩ P =  2.  Plugging 
|
|
|
|
|
| 
|
|
all this into the formula gives: 
M ∩ E M ∩ P
| − |
M ∪ E ∪ P =  M | + E + P
|
|
|

=  60 + 200 + 40 − 6 − 5 − 13 + 2

Sequences with 42, 04, or 60 
In how many permutations of the set {0, 1, 2, . . . , 9} do either 4 and 2, 0 and 4, or 6 and 0 
appear consecutively?  For example, none of these pairs appears in: 

(7, 2, 9, 5, 4, 1, 3, 8, 0, 6) 

The 06 at  the end doesn’t  count; we need 60.  On  the other hand,  both 04 and 60 appear 
consecutively in this permutation: 

(7, 2, 5, 6, 0, 4, 3, 8, 1, 9) 

10 

Counting II 

Let  P42  be  the  set  of  all  permutations  in which  42  appears;  deﬁne  P60  and  P04  similarly. 
Thus, for example, the permutation above is contained in both P60  and P04 .  In these terms, 
we’re looking for the size of the set P42  ∪ P04  ∪ P60 . 
First, we must determine the sizes of the individual sets, such as P60 . We can use a trick: 
group  the 6 and 0  together as a single symbol.  Then  there  is a natural bijection between 
permutations of {0, 1, 2, . . . 9} containing 6 and 0 consecutively and permutations of: 
{60, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9} 
For example, the following two sequences correspond: 
⇔ 
(7, 2, 5, 6, 0, 4, 3, 8, 1, 9) 
(7, 2, 5, 60, 4, 3, 8, 1, 9) 
There  are  9!   permutations  of  the  set  containing  60,  so  |P60 |  =  9!   by  the  Bijection  Rule. 
Similarly, |P04 | = 
|P42 |
= 9!  as well. 
Next,  we  must  determine  the  sizes  of  the  two­way  intersections,  such  as  P42  ∩  P60 . 
Using the grouping trick again, there is a bijection with permutations of the set: 
{42, 60, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9} 
Thus,  P42   ∩ P60 =  8!.  Similarly,  P60  ∩ P04 =  8!  by a bijection with the set: 
|

|
| 
|
{604, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}

And  P42  ∩ P04 =  8!  as well by a similar argument.  Finally, note that  P60  ∩ P04  ∩ P42 =  7!
|
| 
|
|
by a bijection with the set: 
{6042, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9} 
Plugging all this into the formula gives: 
P42  ∪ P04  ∪ P60 =  9!  +  9!   +  9!  − 8!  − 8!  − 8!  +  7! 
|

3.3  Union of n Sets 

The size of a union of n sets is given by the following rule. 
Rule 3 (Inclusion­Exclusion). 

|S1  ∪ S2  ∪ · · · ∪ S | 
n =
the sum of the sizes of the individual sets 
the sizes of all two­way intersections 
the sizes of all three­way intersections 
the sizes of all four­way intersections 
the sizes of all ﬁve­way intersections, etc.

There are various ways to write the Inclusion­Exclusion formula in mathematical sym­
bols, but none are particularly clear,  so we’ve  just used words.  The  formulas  for unions 
of two and three sets are special cases of this general rule.

4  The Grand Scheme for Counting 

11 

The rules and techniques we’ve covered to this point snap together into an overall scheme 
for solving elementary counting problems. Here it is: 

Grand Scheme for Counting 

1.  Learn to count sequences using two techniques: 

•  the General Product Rule 
•  the BOOKKEEPER formula 

2.  Translate everything else to a sequence­counting problem via: 

•  bijections 
•  k ­to­1 functions 

3.  But for unions of sets, use Inclusion­Exclusion. 

Everything here should be  familiar  to you by now,  except  for  the BOOKKEEPER  for­
mula, which you’ll see in recitation tomorrow.
