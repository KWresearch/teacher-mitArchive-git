Proofs 

Why do you believe that 3   +  3   = 6? 

Is it because your second­grade teacher, Miss Dalrymple, told you so?  She might have 
been lying, you know. Or are you trusting life experience?  If you have three coconuts and 
someone gives you three more coconuts, then you have— aha!— six coconuts.  But if that 
is the true basis for your belief, then why do you also believe that 

3,   000,  000,  000  +   3,  000,  000,  000  = 6,  000,  000,  000? 

Surely you’ve never actually counted six billion of anything! 

Maybe 3  +  3  = 6  is just “intuitively obvious”, and we shouldn’t talk about it anymore. 

Hey, here  is a game!  I secretly put one or more dollar bills  into an envelope and  then 
put twice as many dollar bills into a second envelope: 

$n 

$2n 

I  seal  both  envelopes,  mix  them  up,  and  present  them  to  you.  You  can  pick  one  and 
look  inside  to  see how much money  it  contains.  Then you  can  either  take  the money  in 
that  envelope  or  take  the  unknown  amount  of money  in  the  other  envelope.  Those  are 
the rules.  For example, suppose we play  this game and you ﬁnd $8  in  the envelope you 
initially selected. 

$8 

? 

What  is  your  most  proﬁtable  course?  Keep  the  $8?  Or  take  the  unknown  amount  in 
the other envelope?  Are both options equally good?  This  situation  is hardly more com­
plicated  than  having  three  coconuts  and  being  given  three  more.  Yet  now  the  correct 
conclusion  is  far  from  “intuitively  obvious”.  Seemingly  plausible  arguments  about  this 
problem degenerate to absurdities and contradictions. 

So  you may want  to  dismiss  3 +  3  = 6  and  hurry  along,  but  eventually we  do  have 
to  confront  the underlying question:  how  can we  know  anything  in mathematics?  When 
intuition falters as a guide to truth, how can we distinguish valid mathematics from crack­
pot  ravings?  These  are  show­stopper  questions.  Without  clear  answers,  all  the  number 
crunching and variable juggling in mathematics is just so much nonsense.

Proofs


The Two­Envelopes Game 

Here are some “solutions”: 

•	 You  picked  an  envelope  at  random,  so  you were  just  as  likely  to  pick  the  one 
with more dollars as the one with fewer. Therefore, if you see $8, then the other 
envelope  is  equally  likely  to  contain  either  $4  or  $16.  On  average,  the  other 
envelope contains (4  + 16)/2  = 10  dollars, which is more than the $8 you see. So 
you should clearly switch to the unopened envelope. 
However, a similar argument applies no matter what amount you see  initially. 
So  you  should  always  switch,  regardless  of  the  amount  in  the  ﬁrst  envelope. 
Thus, the best strategy is to pick one envelope and then, without even bothering 
to look inside, take the amount of money in the other. But that’s absurd! 

•	 You  were  just  as  likely  to  pick  the  envelope  with  more  dollars  as  with  fewer. 
So,  on  average,  the  amount  of money  in  the  envelope  you  picked  is  the  same 
as  the  amount  in  the  unopened  envelope.  So  staying  or  switching  makes  no 
difference. 
But what  if you saw $1?  In  that case, you could be certain  that  the other enve­
lope contained $2.  So your strategy would make a difference! 

•	 Look at the problem from my perspective.  Clearly, I should not put $1 in either 
envelope;  that  would  give  you  a  big  advantage.  If  you  opened  the  envelope 
with $1, then you would know to switch.  But then if you see $2 in an envelope, 
you know that the other envelope must contain $4 since we just ruled out $1.  So 
you also have a big advantage in this situation.  My only choice is to never put 
$2  in  an  envelope  either.  And  I  can’t  use  $3;  if  you  saw  that,  you’d  know  the 
other envelope held $6.  And  if you see $4, you know  the other envelope must 
contain $8. Apparently, I can’t run the game at all! 
We’re revisit this problem later in the term when we study probability.

1  The Axiomatic Method 

3 

The standard procedure for establishing truth in mathematics was invented by Euclid, a 
mathematician working  in Alexadria, Egypt around 300 BC. His  idea was  to begin with 
ﬁve  assumptions  about  geometry,  which  seemed  undeniable  based  on  direct  experience. 
(For  example,  “There  is  a  straight  line  segment  between  every  pair  of  points.)  Proposi­
tions like these that are simply accepted as true are called axioms. 
Starting  from  these  axioms,  Euclid  established  the  truth  of many  additional proposi­
tions  by  providing  “proofs”.  A  proof  is  a  sequence  of  logical  deductions  from  axioms 
and previously­proved  statements  that  concludes with  the proposition  in question.  You 
probably wrote many proofs  in high  school geometry  class,  and you’ll  see  a  lot more  in 
this course. 
There are several common terms for a proposition that has been proved. The different 
terms hint at the role of the proposition within a larger body of work. 

•	 Important propositions are called theorems. 

•	 A lemma is a preliminary proposition useful for proving later propositions. 

•	 A corollary is an afterthought, a proposition that follows in just a few logical steps 
from a theorem. 

The deﬁnitions are not precise.  In fact, sometimes a good lemma turns out to be far more 
important than the theorem it was originally used to prove. 
Euclid’s axiom­and­proof approach, now called the axiomatic method,  is the founda­
tion for mathematics today.  Amazingly, essentially all mathematics can be derived from 
just a handful of axioms called ZFC together with a few logical principles.  This does not 
completely  settle  the  question  of  truth  in  mathematics,  but  it  greatly  focuses  the  issue. 
You  can  still deny  a mathematical  theorem,  but  only  if  you  reject  one  of  the  elementary 
ZFC axioms or ﬁnd a logical error in the proof. 

1.1  Our Axioms 

For  our  purposes,  the  ZFC  axioms  are  too  primitive—  by  one  reckoning,  proving  that 
2 + 2 =  4 requires more  than 20,000  steps!  So  instead of  starting with ZFC, we’re going 
to  take  a  huge  set  of  axioms  as  our  foundation:  we’ll  accept  all  familiar  facts  from  high 
school math! 
This will  give  us  a  quick  launch,  but  you  will  ﬁnd  this  imprecise  speciﬁcation  of  the 
axioms  troubling  at  times  .  For  example,  in  the midst of  a proof,  you may ﬁnd yourself 
wondering,  “Must  I  prove  this  little  fact  or  can  I  take  it  as  an  axiom?”  Feel  free  to  ask 
for  guidance,  but  really  there  is  no  absolute  answer.  Just  be  upfront  about what  you’re 
assuming, and don’t try to evade homework and exam problems by declaring everything 
an axiom!

Proofs


The ZFC Axioms 

These  are  the  axioms  of  Zermelo­Fraenkel  set  theory  with  some  technicalities 
omitted.  The  variables  denote  distinct  sets.  Essentially  all  of  mathematics  can  be 
derived from these axioms together with a few principles of logic. 

Extensionality.  Sets are equal if they contain the same elements: 
∀z (z  ∈ x  ⇔ z  ∈ y)  ⇒ 

x  =  y

Union.  The union of a collection of sets is also a set: 
∃y∀z (∃w(z  ∈ w  ∧ w  ∈ x)   ⇒ z  ∈ y) 

Inﬁnity.  There  is  an  inﬁnite  set;  speciﬁcally,  a  set  contained  in  the  union  of  its  ele­
ments. 
∃y(∃x(x  ∈ y) ∧ ∀z (z  ∈ y  ⇒ ∃w(z  ∈ w  ∧ w  ∈ y))) 

Power Set.  All subsets of a set form another set. 
∃y∀z (∀w(w   ∈ z  ⇒ w  ∈ x)   ⇒ z  ∈ y) 

Replacement.  The image of a function is a set. 
∀w∃y∀z (φ(w, z )  ⇒ z  =  y)  ⇒ ∃y∀z (z  ∈ y  ⇔ ∃w(w   ∈ x  ∧ φ(w, z ))) 

Regularity.  Every nonempty set contains a set disjoint from itself. 
∃y(y  ∈ x)  ⇒ ∃y(y  ∈ x  ∧ ∀z (z  ∈ y  ⇒ ¬
z  ∈ x))

Choice.  We can pick one element from each set in a collection. 
∃y∀z∀w((z  ∈ w  ∧ w  ∈ x)  ⇒ ∃v∃u(∃t((u  ∈ w  ∧ w  ∈ t) ∧ (u   ∈ t  ∧ t  ∈ y))   ⇔ 

u  =  v))

We’re not going  to be working with  the ZFC axioms  in  this  course.  We  just  thought 
you might like to see them.

1.2  Proofs in Practice 

5 

In principle, a proof can be any sequence of logical deductions from axioms and previously­
proved statements that concludes with the proposition in question.  This freedom in con­
structing a proof can seem overwhelming at ﬁrst. How do you even start a proof? 

Here’s  the  good  news:  many  proofs  follow  one  of  a  handful  of  standard  templates. 
Proofs  all  differ  in  the  details,  of  course,  but  these  templates  at  least  provide  you  with 
an outline to ﬁll in.  We’ll go through several of these standard patterns, pointing out the 
basic  idea  and  common pitfalls  and giving  some  examples.  Many  of  these  templates ﬁt 
together; one may give you a  top­level outline while others help you at  the next  level of 
detail. And we’ll show you other, more sophisticated proof techniques later on. 

The recipes below are very speciﬁc at times,  telling you exactly which words to write 
down on your piece of paper.  You’re certainly  free  to say  things your own way  instead; 
we’re just giving you something you could say so that you’re never at a complete loss. 

2  Proving an Implication 

An  enormous  number  of mathematical  claims  have  the  form  “If  P ,  then Q”  or,  equiva­
lently, “P  implies Q”. Here are some examples: 
•  (Quadratic Formula) If ax2  + bx   + c  =  0 and a  =  0, then x   =  (−b  ± √

b2  − 4ac)/2a. 

•	 (Goldbach’s Conjecture) If n  is an even integer greater than 2, then n  is a sum of two 
primes. 
•	 If 0 ≤ x  ≤ 2, then −x3  + 4x  + 1 >  0. 

There are a couple standard methods for proving an implication. 

2.1  Method #1 

In order to prove that P  implies Q: 

1.  Write, “Assume P .” 

2.  Show that Q logically follows. 

�
6	

Example 
Theorem 1.  If 0 ≤ x ≤ 2, then −x3  + 4x + 1 > 0. 

Proofs 

Before we write a proof of this theorem, we have to do some scratchwork to ﬁgure out 
why it is true. 
The inequality certainly holds for x =  0; then the left side is equal to 1 and 1 > 0. As x 
grows, the 4x term (which is positive) initially seems to have greater magnitude than −x
3
(which  is negative).  For  example, when  x =  1, we have  4x =  4,  but −x =  −1 only.  In 
3
fact, it looks like −x3  doesn’t begin to dominate until x > 2.  So it seems the −x3  + 4x part 
should be nonnegative for all x between 0 and 2, which would imply that −x3  + 4x + 1 is 
positive. 
So far, so good.  But we still have  to replace all  those “seems  like” phrases with solid, 
logical arguments. We can get a better handle on the critical −x3  + 4x part by factoring it, 
which is not too hard: 
−x 3  + 4x  =  x(2 − x)(2 + x)  
2
Aha!  For  x between  0  and  2,  all  of  the  terms  on  the  right  side  are  nonnegative.  And  a 
product of nonnegative  terms  is  also nonnegative.  Let’s organize  this blizzard of obser­
vations into a clean proof. 

Proof.  Assume  0 ≤  x ≤  2.  Then  x,  2 − x,  and  2 + x are  all  nonnegative.  Therefore,  the 
product  of  these  terms  is  also  nonnegative.  Adding  1  to  this  product  gives  a  positive 
number, so: 
x(2 − x)(2 + x) + 1 > 0 
Multiplying out on the left side proves that 
−x 3  + 4x + 1 > 0 

as claimed. 

There are a couple points here that apply to all proofs: 

•	 You’ll often need to do some scratchwork while you’re trying to ﬁgure out the log­
ical  steps  of  aproof.  Your  scratchwork  can be  as disorganized  as you  like—  full of 
dead­ends, strange diagrams, obscene words, whatever. But keep your scratchwork 
separate from your ﬁnal proof, which should be clear and concise. 

•	 Proofs typically begin with the word “Proof ” and end with some sort of doohickey 
like � or “q.e.d”.  The only purpose for these conventions is to clarify where proofs 
begin and end. 

Proofs 

2.2  Method #2 ­ Prove the Contrapositive 

7 

Remember  that  an  implication  (“P  implies  Q”)  is  logically  equivalent  to  its  contrapos­
itive  (“not  Q  implies  not  P ”);  proving  one  is  as  good  as  proving  the  other.  And  often 
proving  the  contrapositive  is  easier  than proving  the  original  statement.  If  so,  then  you 
can proceed as follows: 

1.  Write, “We prove the contrapositive:”  and then state the contrapositive. 

2.  Proceed as in Method #1. 

Example 

√
Theorem 2.  If r   is irrational, then 

r  is also irrational. 

√
Recall that rational numbers are equal to a ratio of integers and irrational numbers are 
not.  So  we  must  show  that  if  r  is  not  a  ratio  of  integers,  then 
r  is  also  not  a  ratio  of 
integers.  That’s  pretty  convoluted!  We  can  eliminate  both  “not”’s  and  make  the  proof 
straightforward by considering the contrapositive instead. 
√
Proof.  We prove the contrapositive:  if 
r  is rational, then r  is rational. 
√
r  is rational. Then there exists integers a  and b  such that: 
Assume that 
√
a
b 

r  = 

Squaring both sides gives: 

r  = 

2a
b2 

Since a2  and b2  are integers, r  is also rational. 

3  A Bogus Technique: Reasoning Backward 

Somewhere out in America there must be dozens of high school teachers whispering into 
innocent ears that “reasoning backward” in proofs is ﬁne...  oh, yes, jusssst ﬁne.  Probably 
they sacriﬁce little furry animals on moonless nights, too.  In any case, they’re wrong. 
Let’s use the utterly  incorrect, but depressingly popular technique of reasoning back­
ward to “prove” a famous inequality. 

Theorem  3  (Arithmetic­Geometric Mean  Inequality).  For  all  nonnegative  real  numbers  a 
and b: 
a  +  b  √
≥ 
2 

ab

Proof.

4ab≥ 
? 
a 2  + 2ab  + b2 
a
2 − 2ab  + b2 
0≥
? 
(a  − b)2 ≥ 0

The  last  statement  is  true  because  the  square  of  a  real  number  (such  as  a  −  b)  is  never 
× 
negative. This proves the claim. 

a  + b 

In  this  argument, we  started with what we wanted  to prove  and  then  reasoned until 
we reached a statement that is surely true. The little question marks, I guess, are supposed 
to indicate that we’re not quite certain that the inequalities are valid until we get down to 
the last step. At that point, we know everything checks out, apparently. 

3.1  Why Reasoning Backward Is Bad 

In reasoning backward, we began with the proposition in question— call it P — and rea­
soned to a true conclusion. Thus, what we actually proved is: 
⇒ 

P 

true 

But this implication is trivially true, regardless of whether P  is true or false! Therefore, by rea­
soning backward we can “prove” not only true statements, but also every false statement! 
Here’s an example: 

Claim.  0 =  1 

Proof. 

?=  1 
0 
00 · 
?=  1 · 0 
0 =  0 

× 

So resist the urge to reason backward.  If this keeps happening to you anyway, pound 
your writing hand with  a heavy  textbook  to make  it  stop.  Shout  “WRONG! WRONG!” 
with each blow. 

Proofs	

3.2  Reasoning Backward as Scratchwork 

9 

Sometimes you might want  to  try reasoning backward— but not  in a proof.  In particular, 
when you’re  trying  to ﬁnd a proof, you’ll often do some scratchwork as you explore dif­
ferent approaches and ideas.  In this context, reasoning backward is reasonable. You might 
then be able to reverse the order of the steps and get a valid proof. 

4  Proving an “If and Only If” 

Many mathematical theorems assert that two statements are logically equivalent; that is, 
one holds if and only if the other does. Here are some examples: 

•	 An integer is a multiple of 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3. 

•	 Two triangles have the same side lengths if and only if all angles are the same. 
•	 A  positive  integer  p  ≥  2 is  prime  if  and  only  if  1 + (p  − 1) · (p  − 2) · · · 3 · 2 · 1 is  a 
multiple of p. 

4.1  Method #1: Prove Each Statement Implies the Other 

The statement “P  if and only if Q” is equivalent to the two statements “P  implies Q” and 
“Q  implies P ”.  So you can prove an “if and only if ” by proving two implications: 

1.  Write, “We prove P  implies Q  and vice­versa.” 

2.  Write, “First, we show P  implies Q.” Do this by one of the methods in Section 2. 

3.  Write,  “Now,  we  show  Q  implies  P .”  Again,  do  this  by  one  of  the  methods  in 
Section 2. 

Example 

Two sets are deﬁned to be equal if they contain the same elements; that is, X  = Y  means 
z  ∈ X  if and only if z  ∈ Y  .  (This is actually the ﬁrst of the ZFC axioms.) So set equivalence 
proofs often have an “if and only if ” structure. 

Theorem 4 (DeMorgan’s Law for Sets).  Let A, B , and C  be sets. Then: 
A  ∩ (B  ∪ C ) = (A  ∩ B ) ∪ (A  ∩ C ) 

10 
Proof.  We show z  ∈ A ∩ (B ∪ C ) implies z  ∈ (A ∩ B ) ∪ (A ∩ C ) and vice­versa. 
First, we show z  ∈ A ∩ (B ∪ C ) implies z  ∈ (A ∩ B ) ∪ (A ∩ C ). Assume z  ∈ A ∩ (B ∪ C ). 
Then z  is in A and z  is also in B or C .  Thus, z  is in either A ∩ B or A ∩ C , which implies 
z  ∈ (A ∩ B ) ∪ (A ∩ C )
.
Now, we show z  ∈ (A∩B )∪(A∩C ) implies z  ∈ A∩(B ∪C ). Assume z  ∈ (A∩B )∪(A∩C ). 
Then z is in both A and B or else z is in both A and C . Thus, z is in A and z is also in B or 
C . This implies z  ∈ A ∩ (B ∪ C ). 

Proofs 

4.2  Method #2: Construct a Chain of Iffs 

In order to prove that P  is true if and only if Q is true: 

1.  Write, “We construct a chain of if­and­only­if implications.” 

2.  Prove P  is equivalent to a second statement which is equivalent to a third staement 
and so forth until you reach Q. 

This method is generally more difﬁcult than the ﬁrst, but the result can be a short, elegant 
proof. 

Example 

� 
The standard deviation of a sequence of values x1 , x2 , . . . , xn  is deﬁned to be: 
(x1  − µ)2  + (x1  − µ)2  + . . . + (xn  − µ)
2
where µ is the average of the values: 

x1  + x2  + . . . + xn 
n 
Theorem 5.  The standard deviation of a sequence of values x1 , . . . , xn  is zero if and only if all the 
values are equal to the mean. 

µ = 

For example, the standard deviation of test scores is zero if and only if everyone scored 
exactly the class average. 
� 
Proof.  We  construct  a  chain  of  “if  and  only  if ”  implications.  The  standard  deviation  of 
x1 , . . . , xn  is zero if and only if: 
(x1  − µ)2  + (x1  − µ)2  + . . . + (xn  − µ)2  =  0 
where µ is the average of x1 , . . . , xn . This equation holds if and only if 
(x1  − µ)2  + (x1  − µ) + . . . + (xn  − µ)2  =  0 
2
since  zero  is  the  only  number whose  square  root  is  zero.  Every  term  in  this  equation  is 
nonnegative, so this equation holds if and only every term is actually 0.  But this is true if 
and only if every value xi  is equal to the mean µ.

5  How to Write Good Proofs 

11 

The purpose of a proof  is  to provide  the  reader with deﬁnitive evidence of an assertion’s 
truth.  To serve  this purpose effectively, more  is  required of a proof  than  just  logical cor­
rectness:  a  good  proof  must  also  be  clear.  These  goals  are  usually  complimentary;  a 
well­written proof  is more  likely  to be a correct proof, since mistakes are harder  to hide. 
Here are some tips on writing good proofs: 

State your game plan.  A good proof begins by explaining  the general  line of reasoning, 
e.g.  “We  use  case  analysis”  or  “We  argue  by  contradiction”.  This  creates  a  rough 
mental picture into which the reader can ﬁt the subsequent details. 

Keep a linear ﬂow.  We  sometimes  see  proofs  that  are  like  mathematical  mosaics,  with 
juicy  tidbits of  reasoning  sprinkled across  the page.  This  is not good.  The  steps of 
your argument should follow one another in a sequential order. 

A proof is an essay, not a calculation.  Many students initially write proofs the way they 
compute integrals. The result is a long sequence of expressions without explantion. 
This  is bad.  A good proof usually  looks  like an essay with some equations  thrown 
in. Use complete sentences. 

Avoid excessive symbolism.  Your reader is probably good at understanding words, but 
much less skilled at reading arcane mathematical symbols. So use words where you 
reasonably can. 

Simplify.  Long,  complicated proofs  take  the  reader more  time and effort  to understand 
and  can more  easily  conceal  errors.  So  a  proof with  fewer  logical  steps  is  a  better 
proof. 

Introduce notation thoughtfully.  Sometimes  an  argument  can  be  greatly  simpliﬁed  by 
introducing  a  variable,  devising  a  special  notation,  or  deﬁning  a  new  term.  But 
do  this  sparingly  since you’re  requiring  the  reader  to  remember  all  that new  stuff. 
And remember to actually deﬁne the meanings of new variables, terms, or notations; 
don’t just start using them! 

Structure long proofs.  Long programs are usually broken into a heirarchy of smaller pro­
cedures. Long proofs are much the same.  Facts needed in your proof that are easily 
stated,  but  not  readily  proved  are  best  pulled  out  and  proved  in  preliminary  lem­
mas.  Also, if you are repeating essentially the same argument over and over, try to 
capture that argument in a general lemma, which you can cite repeatedly instead. 

Don’t bully.  Words such as “clearly” and “obviously” serve no logical function.  Rather, 
they almost always signal an attempt  to bully  the  reader  into accepting something 
which  the  author  is having  trouble  justifying  rigorously.  Don’t use  these words  in 
your own proofs and go on the alert whenever you read one. 

12 

Proofs 

Finish.  At some point in a proof, you’ll have established all the essential facts you need. 
Resist the temptation to quit and leave the reader to draw the “obvious” conclusion. 
What is obvious to you as the author is not likely to be obvious to the reader.  Instead, 
tie everything together yourself and explain why the original claim follows. 

The analogy between good proofs and good programs extends beyond structure.  The 
same  rigorous  thinking  needed  for  proofs  is  essential  in  the  design  of  critical  computer 
system.  When  algorithms  and  protocols  only  “mostly  work”  due  to  reliance  on  hand­
waving arguments,  the  results can  range  from problematic  to catastrophic.  An early ex­
ample was  the  Therac  25,  a machine  that  provided  radiation  therapy  to  cancer  victims, 
but  occasionally  killed  them  with  massive  overdoses  due  to  a  software  race  condition. 
More  recently,  in August  2004,  a  single  faulty  command  to  a  computer  system  used  by 
United and American Airlines grounded the entire ﬂeet of both companies— and all their 
passengers! 

It  is  a  certainty  that  we’ll  all  one  day  be  at  the  mercy  of  critical  computer  systems 
designed by you  and your  classmates.  So we  really hope  that you’ll develop  the  ability 
to  formulate  rock­solid  logical  arguments  that  a  system  actually  does what  you  think  it 
does! 

6  Proof by Contradiction 

In  a proof  by  contradiction or  indirect proof ,  you  show  that  if  a proposition were  false, 
then some logical contradiction or absurdity would follow. Thus, the proposition must be 
true.  Proof by contradiction is always a viable approach.  However, as the name suggests, 
indirect  proofs  can  be  a  little  convoluted.  So  direct  proofs  are  generally  preferable  as  a 
matter of clarity. 

6.1  Method 

In order to prove a proposition P  by contradiction: 

1.  Write, “We use proof by contradiction.” 

2.  Write, “Suppose P  is false.” 

3.  Deduce a logical contradiction. 

4.  Write, “This is a contradiction. Therefore, P  must be true.”

3.5 =  7/2 and  0.1111 . . .   =  1/9 are  rational numbers.  On  the other hand, we’ll prove by 
contradiction that 
2 is irrational.

2 is irrational. 
Theorem 6. 
√
Proof.  We  use  proof  by  contradiction.  Suppose  the  claim  is  false;  that  is, 
2 as a fraction a/b in lowest terms. 
Then we can write 
Squaring both sides gives 2 =  a2/b2  and so 2b =  a2 . This implies that a is even; that is, 
2
a is a multiple of 2. Therefore, a2  must be a multiple of 4. Because of the equality 2b =  a , 
2
2
we know  2b2  must  also be  a multiple of  4.  This  implies  that  b2  is  even  and  so  b must be 
even. But since a and b are both even, the fraction a/b is not in lowest terms. 
√
2 must be irrational. 
This is a contradiction. Therefore, 

2 is  rational.

6.2  Potential Pitfall 

Often students use an  indirect proof when a direct proof would be simpler.  Such proofs 
aren’t wrong;  they  just aren’t excellent.  Let’s  look at an example.  A  function f is strictly 
increasing if f (x) > f (y) for all real x and y such that x > y . 
Theorem 7.  If f and g are strictly increasing functions, then f +g is a strictly increasing function. 

Let’s ﬁrst look at a simple, direct proof. 

Proof.  Let x and y be arbitrary real numbers such that x > y . Then: 
(since f is strictly increasing) 
(since g is strictly increasing) 

f (x) > f (y) 
g(x) > g(y) 

Adding these inequalities gives: 

f (x) + g(x) > f (y) + g(y) 
Thus, f + g is strictly increasing as well. 

Now we could prove the same theorem by contradiction, but this makes the argument 
needlessly convoluted. 

Proof.  We use proof by contradiction.  Suppose that f + g is not strictly  increasing.  Then 
there must exist real numbers x and y such that x > y , but 
f (x) + g(x) ≤ f (y) + g(y) 
This inequality can only hold if either f (x) ≤  f (y) or g(x) ≤  g(y).  Either way, we have a 
contradiction because both f and g were deﬁned to be strictly increasing. Therefore, f + g 
must actually be strictly increasing.

7  Does All This Really Work? 

Proofs 

So  this  is  where  mainstream  mathematics  stands  today:  there  is  a  handfull  of  axioms 
from which  everything  else  in mathematics  can be  logically derived.  This  sounds  like  a 
rosy  situation,  but  there  are  several  dark  clouds,  suggesting  that  the  essence  of  truth  in 
mathematics is not completely resolved. 

•	 The ZFC axioms weren’t etched  in  stone by God.  Instead,  they were mostly made 
up by some guy named Zermelo. Probably some days he forgot his house keys. 

•	 No one knows whether the ZFC axioms are logically consistent; there is some possi­
bility  that  one  person  might  prove  a  proposition  P  and  another  might  prove  the 
proposition  ¬P .  Then  math  would  be  broken.  This  sounds  like  a  crazy  situa­
tion,  but  it  has  happened  before.  Around  the  beginning  of  the  20th  century  sev­
eral mathematicians— most famously Bertrand Russell— discovered that accepted 
principles of mathematics at that time actually were self­contradictory! 

•	 While  the  ZFC  axioms  largely  generate  the mathematics  everyone wants— where 
3 + 3 =  6 and other basic  facts are  true—  they also  imply  some disturbing conclu­
sions.  For  example,  the Banach­Tarski Theorem  says  that  a ball  can be  cut  into  six 
pieces and then the pieces can be rearranged to give two balls, each the same size as 
the original! 

•	 In the 1930’s, G ¨odel proved that the ZFC axioms are not complete; that is, there exist 
propositions that are true, but do not logically follow from the axioms. There seems 
to be no way out of this disturbing situation; simply adding more axioms does not 
eliminate the problem. 

These problems will not trouble us in 6.042, but they are interesting to think about!
