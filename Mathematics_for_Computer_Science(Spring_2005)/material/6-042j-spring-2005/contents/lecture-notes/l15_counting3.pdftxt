Today we’ll brieﬂy review some facts you dervied in recitation on Friday and then turn 
to some applications of counting.

This is a special case of an exceptionally useful counting principle. 

Rule 1  (Bookkeeper Rule).  The number  of  sequences with n1  copies  of  l1 ,  n2  copies  of  l2 ,  . . . , 
and nk  copies of lk  is 

provided l1 , . . . , lk  are distinct. 

(n1  +  n2  +  . . . +  nk )!  
n1 !  n2 !  . . .  nk ! 

Let’s review some applications and implications of the Bookkeeper Rule. 

1.1  20­Mile Walks 

I’m planning a 20 miles walk, which should include 5 northward miles, 5 eastward miles, 
5 southward miles, and 5 westward miles. How many different walks are possible? 

There  is  a  bijection  between  such walks  and  sequences with  5 N’s,  5 E’s,  5  S’s,  and  5 
W’s. By the Bookkeeper Rule, the number of such sequences is: 

20!  
5!4

1.2  Bit Sequences 

How many n­bit sequences contain exactly k ones? 
Each such sequence also contains n − k zeroes, so there are 

n! 
k ! (n − k)!  

by the Bookkeeper Rule. 

1.3  k­element Subsets of an n­element Set 

How many k ­elements subsets of an n­element set are there?  This question arises all the 
time in various guises: 

•	 In how many ways can I select 5 books from my collection of 100 to bring on vaca­
tion? 

•	 How many different 13­card Bridge hands can be dealt from a 52­card deck? 

•	 In how many ways can I select 5 toppings for my pizza if there are 14 available? 

There  is  a  natural  bijection  between  k ­element  subsets  of  an  n­element  set  and  n­bit 
sequences with exactly k ones.  For example, here is a 3­element subset of {x1 , x2 , . . . , x8}
and the associated 8­bit sequence with exactly 3 ones: 
{
( 

x4 , x5 
1,  0,  0,  0 
1, 

x1 ,
1, 

0,  0, 

}
)  

Therefore,  the  answer  to  this  problem  is  the  same  as  the  answer  to  the  earlier  question 
about bit sequences. 
�	 � 
Rule 2 (Subset Rule).  The number of k ­element subsets of an n­element set is: 
n 
k 

�	 � 
The factorial expression in the Subset Rule comes up so often that there is a shorthand, 
n
. This is read “n choose k” since it denotes the number of ways to choose k items from 
k 
�
� 
among n. We can immediately knock off all three questions above using the Sum Rule: 
�	 � 
•	 I can select 5 books from 100 in  100  ways.
5 
•	 There are  52   different Bridge hands.

n! 
k ! (n − k)!  

=

� � 
•  There are  14   different 5­topping pizzas, if 14 toppings are available.

The k ­element subsets of an n­element set are sometimes called k­combinations. There 
are  a  great  many  similar­sounding  terms:  permutations,  r­permutations,  permutations 
with  repetition,  combinations  with  repetition,  permutations  with  indistinguishable  ob­
jects, and so on.  For example,  the Bookkeeper Rule is sometimes called the “formula for 
permutations with indistinguishable objects”. Broadly speaking, permutations concern se­
quences and combinations concern subsets. However, the counting rules we’ve taught you 
are  sufﬁcient  to  solve  all  these  sorts  of  problems  without  knowing  this  jargon,  so  we’ll 
skip it.

1.4  Word of Caution 

Someday you might refer to the Bookkeeper Rule in front of a roomful of colleagues and 
discover  that  they’re  all  staring  back  at  you  blankly.  This  is  not  because  they’re  dumb, 
but  rather because we  just made up  the name  “Bookkeeper Rule”.  However,  the  rule  is 
excellent  and  the  name  is  apt,  so  we  suggest  that  you  play  through:  “You  know?  The 
Bookkeeper Rule? Don’t you guys know anything???” 

2  Binomial Theorem 

Counting gives insight into one of the basic theorems of algebra.  A binomial is a sum of 
two terms, such as a  + b. Now let’s consider a postive, integral power of a binomial: 
(a  + b)n 

Suppose we multiply out this expression completely for, say, n  = 4: 
(a  + b)4  = aaaa  + aaab  + aaba  + aabb 
+ abaa  + abab  + abba  + abbb 
+ baaa  + baab   + baba  + babb 
+ bbaa  + bbab  + bbba  + bbbb 
�  � 
Notice that there  is one term for every sequence of a’s and b’s.  Therefore,  the number of 
terms with k   copies of b  and n  − k  copies of a  is: 
n! 
n 
k ! (n  − k)!  
= 
�  � 
k 
by the Bookkeeper Rule. Now let’s group equivalent terms, such as aaab  = aaba  = abaa  = 
�  � 
�  � 
�  � 
�  � 
�  � 
baaa. Then the coefﬁcient of an−k bk  is 
n
.  So for n  = 4, this means:

(a  + b)4  = 

In general, this reasoning gives the Binomial Theorem:

The expression 
is often called a “binomial coefﬁcient” in honor of its appearance here. 
k 
This reasoning about binomials extends nicely to multinomials, which are sums of two 
or more terms.  For example, suppose we wanted the coefﬁcient of 

bo2k2 e  pr 
3

in the expansion of (b +  o +  k +  e +  p +  r)10 . Each term in this expansion is a product of 10 
variables where each variable is one of b, o, k , e, p, or r . Now, the coefﬁcient of bo2k2e pr is 
3
the number of those terms with exactly 1 b, 2 o’s, 2 k ’s, 3 e’s, 1 p, and 1 r . And the number 
� 
� 
of such terms is precisely the number of rearrangments of the word BOOKKEEPER: 
10 
1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1 

10! 
1!   2!  2!  3!   1!  1! 

= 

The expression on  the  left  is an example of a “multinomial coefﬁcient” and  the notation 
on the right is a shorthand. This reasoning extends to a general theorem: 
� 
�  � 
Theorem 2 (Multinomial Theorem).  For all n ∈ N and z1 , . . . zm  ∈ R: 
n
k2  . . . z  km 
k1 z2

m 
k1 , k2 , . . . , km
k1 ,...,km∈N 
k1+...+km =n 

(z1  +  z2  +  . . . +  zm )n  = 

You’ll be  far better off  if your remember  the reasoning behind  the Multinomial Theo­
rem rather than this monstrous equation. 

3  Poker Hands 

There are 52 cards in a deck. Each card has a suit and a value. There are four suits: 
spades 
♠ 
♥ 
♣ 
♦ 
hearts 
clubs 
diamonds 

And there are 13 values: 

jack  queen  king  ace 
2  ,  3  ,  4  ,  5  ,  6  ,  7  ,  8  ,  9  , J ,  Q , K , A 
Thus, for example, 8♥ is the 8 of hearts and A♠ is the ace of spades. Values farther to the 
right in this list are considered “higher ” and values to the left are “lower ”. 

Counting III

Five­Card Draw  is a card game  in which each player  is  initially dealt a hand, a subset 
of 5 cards.  (Then the game gets complicated, but let’s not worry about that.) The number 
of different hands in Five­Card Draw is the number of 5­element subsets of a 52­element 
�  � 
set, which is 52 choose 5: 
52
5 

total # of hands = 

= 2,  598,  960 

Let’s get some counting practice by working out the number of hands with various special 
properties. 

3.1  Hands with a Four­of­a­Kind 

A  Four­of­a­Kind  is  a  set  of  four  cards with  the  same  value.  How many  different  hands 
contain a Four­of­a­Kind? Here a couple examples: 
8♠,  8♦, Q♥,  8♥,  8♣
}
{
{  A♣,  2♣,  2♥,  2♦,  2♠ } 

As usual,  the ﬁrst  step  is  to map  this question  to a  sequence­counting problem.  A hand 
with a Four­of­a­Kind is completely described by a sequence specifying: 

1.  The value of the four cards. 

2.  The value of the extra card. 

3.  The suit of the extra card. 

Thus,  there  is  a  bijection  between  hands  with  a  Four­of­a­Kind  and  sequences  consist­
ing  of  two  distinct  values  followed  by  a  suit.  For  example,  the  three  hands  above  are 
associated with the following sequences: 
{ 
8♠,  8♦,  8♥,  8♣, Q♥
(8,  Q,  ♥)  ↔ 
{
2♣,  2♥,  2♦,  2♠, A♣
(2,  A,   ♣)  ↔

}
} 

Now we need only  count  the  sequences.  There are  13 ways  to  choose  the ﬁrst value,  12 
ways to choose the second value, and 4 ways to choose the suit. Thus, by the Generalized 
Product  Rule,  there  are  13   · 12   · 4  =  624  hands with  a  Four­of­a­Kind.  This means  that 
only 1 hand in about 4165 has a Four­of­a­Kind; not surprisingly, this is considered a very 
good poker hand!

3.2  Hands with a Full House 

Counting III 

A Full House is a hand with three cards of one value and two cards of another value. Here 
are some examples: 
}
{ 
2♠,  2♣,  2♦, J ♣, J ♦
{
} 
5♦,  5♣,  5♥,  7♥,  7♣
Again, we  shift  to a problem about  sequences.  There  is a bijection between Full Houses 
and sequences specifying: 
� � 
1.  The value of the triple, which can be chosen in 13 ways. 
2.  The suits of the triple, which can be selected in  4
3 ways. 
� � 
3.  The value of the pair, which can be chosen in 12 ways. 

4.  The suits of the pair, which can be selected in  4
2 ways. 
The example hands correspond to sequences as shown below: 
(2,  {♠,  ♣,  ♦} ,  J,   {♣,  ♦})  ↔ 
{ 
2♠,  2♣,  2♦, J ♣, J ♦
(5,  {♦,  ♣,  ♥} ,  7,   {♥,  ♣})  ↔ { 
5♦,  5♣,  5♥,  7♥,  7♣
�  � 
�  � 
By the Generalized Product Rule, the number of Full Houses is: 
· 
12  ·
13  · 
4
4 
2 
3 

}
} 

We’re on a roll— but we’re about to hit a speedbump. 

3.3  Hands with Two Pairs 

How many  hands  have  Two  Pairs;  that  is,  two  cards  of  one  value,  two  cards  of  another 
value, and one card of a third value? Here are examples: 
}
3♦,  3♠, Q♦, Q♥, A♣
{
5♣, K♠ } 
{ 
9♥,  9♦,  5♥,

Each hand with Two Pairs is described by a sequence consisting of: 
� � 
1.  The value of the ﬁrst pair, which can be chosen in 13 ways. 
2.  The suits of the ﬁrst pair, which can be selected  4
2 ways. 
� � 
3.  The value of the second pair, which can be chosen in 12 ways.

4.  The suits of the second pair, which can be selected in  4
2 ways. 


Counting III 

� � 
5.  The value of the extra card, which can be chosen in 11 ways. 
6.  The suit of the extra card, which can be selected in  4
1  = 4  ways. 
�  � 
�  � 
Thus, it might appear that the number of hands with Two Pairs is: 
· 
· 
11  · 4 
12  · 
13   · 
4 
4
2

7 

Wrong answer!  The problem is that there is not a bijection from such sequences to hands 
with  Two  Pairs.  This  is  actually  a  2­to­1  mapping.  For  example,  here  are  the  pairs  of 
sequences that map to the hands given above: 
(3, {♦, ♠} ,  Q,  {♦,  ♥} , A,  ♣)  � 
(Q,   {♦,  ♥} , 3,   {♦,  ♠} , A,  ♣)  � 
(9, {♥, ♦} ,  5, {♥, ♣} ,  K, ♠)  �

(5, {♥, ♣} ,  9, {♥, ♦} ,  K, ♠)  � 

3♦,  3♠, Q♦, Q♥, A♣

5♣, K♠ }

{ 

9♥,  9♦,  5♥,


{

}

The problem is that nothing distinguishes the ﬁrst pair from the second. A pair of 5’s and 
a  pair  of  9’s  is  the  same  as  a  pair  of  9’s  and  a  pair  of  5’s.  We  avoided  this  difﬁculty  in 
counting Full Houses because, for example, a pair of 6’s and a triple of kings is different 
from a pair of kings and a triple of 6’s. 
We  ran  into precisely  this difﬁculty  last  time, when we went  from  counting  arrange­
ments of different pieces on a chessboard to counting arrangements of two identical rooks. 
The  solution  then was  to apply  the Division Rule,  and we  can do  the  same here.  In  this 
case, the Division rule says there are twice as many sequences and hands, so the number 
� � 
� � 
of hands with Two Pairs is actually: 
13  ·  4
2 ·
 12  ·
 4
2 ·
 11  · 4 
2 

Another Approach 

The preceding example was disturbing! One could easily overlook the fact that the map­
ping was 2­to­1 on an exam, fail the course, and turn to a life of crime.  You can make the 
world a safer place in two ways: 

→
1.  Whenever  you  use  a  mapping  f 
B  to  translate  one  counting  problem  to 
:  A
another,  check  the  number  elements  in 
A  that  are  mapped  to  each  element  in  B . 
This  determines  the  size  of A  relative  to B .  You  can  then  apply  the Division  Rule 
with the appropriate correction factor.

Counting III 

2.  As  an  extra  check,  try  solving  the  same  problem  in  a  different  way.	 Multiple  ap­
proaches are often available— and all had better give the same answer!  (Sometimes 
different  approaches  give  answers  that  look  different,  but  turn  out  to  be  the  same 
after some algebra.) 
We  already  used  the  ﬁrst  method;  let’s  try  the  second.  There  is  a  bijection  between 
�	 �  � � � � 
hands with two pairs and sequences that specify: 
13
ways.
2 
2.  The suits of the lower­value pair, which can be selected in  4
2 ways. 
3.  The suits of the higher­value pair, which can be selected in  4
2 ways. 
� � 
4.  The value of the extra card, which can be chosen in 11  ways. 
5.  The suit of the extra card, which can be selected in  4
1  = 4  ways. 

1.  The values of the two pairs, which can be chosen in 

For example, the following sequences and hands correspond: 
({3, Q} , {♦, ♠} , {♦, ♥} , A, ♣)  ↔
{
3♦,  
3♠,  
Q♦, 
5♥,  
9♦,  
9♥,  
{ 
({9, 5} , {♥, ♣} , {♥, ♦} , K, ♠)  ↔ 
�  �  �  �  �  � 
Thus, the number of hands with two pairs is: 
· 11  · 4

· 
4

Q♥, 
5♣,

K♠ 

}
} 

This is the same answer we got before, though in a slightly different form. 

3.4  Hands with Every Suit 

How many hands contain at least one card from every suit? Here is an example of such a 
hand: 
} 
{	
7♦, K♣,  3♦, A♥,  2♠
Each such hand is described by a sequence that speciﬁes: 

1.  The values of the diamond, the club, the heart, and the spade, which can be selected 
in 13  · 13   · 13   · 13   =  134  ways. 

2.  The suit of the extra card, which can be selected in 4 ways. 

3.  The value of the extra card, which can be selected in 12 ways. 

Counting III 

9 

For example, the hand above is described by the sequence: 
(7,  K, A,  2,   ♦,  3) 
7♦, K♣, A♥,  2♠,  3♦
↔ { 

} 

Are  there  other  sequences  that  correspond  to  the  same  hand?  There  is  one  more!  We 
could  equally well  regard  either  the  3♦  or  the  7♦  as  the  extra  card,  so  this  is  actually  a 
2­to­1 mapping. Here are the two sequences corresponding to the example hand: 
(7,  K, A,  2,   ♦,  3) 
� 
(3,  K, A,  2,   ♦,  7) 
� 

7♦, K♣, A♥,  2♠,  3♦

{

}

Therefore, the number of hands with every suit is:

4  Magic Trick 

There  is  a Magician  and  an Assistant.  The Assistant goes  into  the  audience with  a deck 
of 52 cards while  the Magician  looks away.  Five audience members each select one card 
from  the deck.  The Assistant  then gathers up  the ﬁve  cards  and  reveals  four of  them  to 
the Magician, one at a time. The Magician concentrates for a short time and then correctly 
names the secret, ﬁfth card! 

4.1  The Secret 

The Assistant somehow communicated the secret card to the Magician just by naming the 
other four cards.  In particular, the Assistant has two ways to communicate: 

1.  He can announce the four cards in any order. The number of orderings of four cards 
is 4!  =  24, so this alone is insufﬁcient to identify which of the remaining 48 cards is 
the secret one. 

2.  The Assistant  can  also  choose which  four  of  the  ﬁve  cards  to  reveal  in  binom54  =  
5  different  ways.  Of  course,  the  Magician  can  not  determine  which  of  these  ﬁve 
possibilities the Assistant selected, since he does not know the secret card. 

Nevertheless,  these  two  forms  of  communication  allow  the  Assistant  to  covertly  reveal 
the secret card to the Magician. 
Our counting  tools give a  lot of  insight  into  the magic  trick.  Put all the sets of 5 cards 
in a collection X  on the left. And put all the sequences of 4 distinct cards in a collection Y 
on the right. 

10 

Counting III

(K♠, 8♥, 6♦, Q♠) 
• 
• 
• 
{8♥, K♠, Q♠, 9♣, 6♦} 
• 
• 
For example, {8♥, K♠, Q♠, 2♦, 6♦} is an element of X on the left.  If the audience selects 
this  set  of  5  cards,  then  there  are many  different  4­card  sequences  on  the  right  in  set  Y 
that the Assistant could choose to reveal, including (8♥, K♠, Q♠, 2♦), (K♠, 8♥, Q♠, 2♦), 
and (K♠, 8♥, 6♦, Q♠). 
Let’s think about this problem in terms of graphs.  Regard the elements of X and Y  as 
the vertices of a bipartite graph.  Put an edge between a set of 5 cards and a sequence of 
4  if  every  card  in  the  sequence  is  also  in  the  set.  In  other words,  if  the  audience  selects 
a  set  of  cards,  then  the Assistant must  reveal  a  sequence  of  cards  that  is  adjacent  in  the 
bipartite graph.  Some edges are shown in the diagram above. 
What we  need  to  perform  the  trick  is  a  matching  for  the  X  vertices;  that  is,  we  need 
a  subset  of  edges  that  join  every  vertex  on  the  left  to  exactly  one,  distinct  vertex  on  the 
right.  If such a matching exists, then the Assistant and Magician can agree one in advance. 
Then, when the audience selects a set of 5 cards, the Assistant reveals the corresponding 
sequence of 4 cards.  The Magician translates back to the correspoding set of 5 cards and 
names the one not already revealed. 
For example, suppose the Assistant and Magician agree on a matching containing the 
two bold edges in the diagram above.  If the audience selects the set {8♥, K♠, Q♠, 9♣, 6♦}, 
then  the Assistant  reveals  the  corresponding  sequence  (K♠, 8♥, 6♦, Q♠).  The Magician 
names the one card in the corresponding set not already revealed, the 9♣. Notice that the 
sets must be matched with distinct sequences; if the Assistant revealed the same sequence 
when  the  audience  picked  the  set  {8♥, K♠, Q♠, 2♦, 6♦},  then  the  Magician  would  be 
unable to determine whether the remaining card was the 9♣ or 2♦! 
The  only  remaining  question  is whether  a matching  for  the X  vertices  exists.  This  is 
precisely  the  subject of Hall’s Theorem.  Regard  the X  vertices as girls,  the Y  vertices as 
boys, and each edge as an indication that a girl likes a boy.  Then a matching for the girls 
exists if and only if the marriage condition is satisﬁed: 

Every subset of girls likes at least as large a set of boys. 

Let’s prove  that  the marriage condition holds  for  the magic  trick graph.  We’ll need a 
couple preliminary facts: 

Counting III	

11 

· 
•	 Each vertex on the left has degree 5  4!  = 120, since there are ﬁve ways to select the 
card kept secret and there are 4!  permutations of the remaining 4 cards.  In terms of 
the marriage metaphor, every girl like 120 boys. 

•	 Each  vertex  on  the  right  has  degree  48,  since  there  are  48  possibilities  for  the  ﬁfth 
card. Thus, every boy is liked by 48 girls. 

Now let S  be an arbitrary set of vertices on the left, which we’re regarding as girls. There 
are 120 |S | edges incident to vertices in this set.  Since each boy is liked by at most 48 girls, 
this set of girls likes at least 120 S /48  ≥  S different boys.  Thus, the marriage condition 
|	
| 
|
|
is satisﬁed, a matching exists by Hall’s Theorem, and the trick can be done without magic! 

4.2  The Real Secret 

�	 � 
You might not ﬁnd the preceding answer very satisfying.  After all, as a practical matter, 
the Assistant and the Magician can not memorize a matching containing  52  = 2,  598,  960  
5 
edges!  The remaining challenge is to choose a matching that can be readily computed on 
the ﬂy.  We’ll describe one approach.  As an running example, suppose that the audience 
selects: 
10♥  9♦  3♥  Q♠  J ♦ 

•	 The  Assistant  picks  out  two  cards  of  the  same  suit.  In  the  example,  the  assistant 
might choose the 3♥ and 10♥. 
•	 The Assistant locates the values of these two cards on the cycle shown below: 

AK 

2 

Q 

J	

10	

3 

4 

5 

9

6 

8

7 

For any two distinct values on this cycle, one is always between 1 and 6 hops clock­
wise from the other.  For example, the 3♥ is 6 hops clockwise from the 10♥. 
•	 The  more  counterclockwise  of  these  two  cards  is  revealed  ﬁrst,  and  the  other  be­
comes the secret card. Thus, in our example, the 10♥ would be revealed, and the 3♥
would be the secret card. Therefore: 

–	 The suit of the secret card is the same as the suit of the ﬁrst card revealed.

–	 The value of the secret card is between 1 and 6 hops clockwise from the value 
of the ﬁrst card revealed. 

•	 All  that  remains  is  to  communicate  a number between 1 and 6.  The Magician and 
Assistant agree beforehand on an ordering of all the cards in the deck from smallest 
to largest such as: 
A♣ 2♣  . . .   K♣ A♦ 2♦  . . .  Q♦ A♥ 2♥  . . .  Q♥ A♠ 2♠  . . .  Q♠ 

The order  in which  the  last  three cards are  revealed communicates  the number ac­
cording to the following scheme: 

small,  medium, 
large 
)  =  1 
( 
large,  medium  )  =  2 
small,  
( 
(  medium, 
small, 
large 
)  =  3 
large, 
(  medium, 
small 
)  =  4 
small,  medium  )  =  5 
large, 
( 
large,  medium, 
small 
( 
)  =  6 

In  the  example,  the  Assistant  wants  to  send  6  and  so  reveals  the  remaining  three 
cards  in  large, medium,  small order.  Here  is  the complete sequence  that  the Magi­
cian sees: 
10♥  Q♠  J ♦  9♦ 
•	 The Magician  starts with  the  ﬁrst  card,  10♥,  and  hops  6  values  clockwise  to  reach 
3♥, which is the secret card! 

4.3  Same Trick with Four Cards? 

Suppose that the audience selects only four cards and the Assistant reviews a sequence of 
three to the Magician. Can the Magician determine the fourth card? 
Let X  be  all  the  sets of  four  cards  that  the  audience might  select,  and  let Y  be  all  the 
�  � 
sequences of three cards that the Assistant might reveal. Now, one on hand, we have 
52

=  270, 725

X | = 

by the Subset Rule. On the other hand, we have 
Y	 =  52  · 51  · 50  =  132, 600 
|
| 

by  the Generalized Product Rule.  Thus, by  the Pigeonhole Principle,  the Assistant must 
reveal the same sequence of three cards for some two different sets of four. This is bad news 
for the Magician:  if he hears that sequence of three, then there are at least two possibilities 
for the fourth card which he cannot distinguish!

Suppose you have n  different T­shirts only want to keep k .  You could equally well select 
the k  shirts you want to keep or select the complementary set of n  − k  shirts you want to 
throw out. Thus, the number of ways to select k  shirts from among n  must be equal to the 
�  �  � 
� 
number of ways to select n  − k  shirts from among n. Therefore: 
n
n 
n  − k 
= 
k
This is easy to prove algebraically, since both sides are equal to: 

n! 
k !  (n  − k)!  
But we didn’t really have to resort to algebra; we just used counting principles. 
Hmm. 

5.1  Boxing 

Ishan, famed 6.042 TA, has decided to try out for the US Olympic boxing team.  After all, 
he’s watched all of  the Rocky movies and  spent hours  in  front of a mirror  sneering,  “Yo, 
you wanna piece a’ me?!”  Ishan ﬁgures  that n  people  (including himself) are competing 
for spots on the team and only k  will be selected. As part of maneuvering for a spot on the 
team, he need to work out how many different teams are possible. There are two cases to 
consider: 
•	 Ishan is selected for the team, and his k  − 1  teammates are selected from among the 
�
� 
other n  − 1  competitors.  The number of different teams that be formed in this way 
is: 
n  − 1 
k  − 1 
•	 Ishan is not selected for the team, and all k  team members are selected from among 
� 
� 
the other n  − 1  competitors. The number of teams that can be formed this way is: 
n  − 1 
k 

All teams of the ﬁrst type contain Ishan, and no team of the second type does; therefore, 
� 
�  � 
� 
the  two  sets  of  teams  are  disjoint.  Thus,  by  the  Sum  Rule,  the  total  number  of  possible 
Olympic boxing teams is: 
n  − 1 
n  − 1 
k  − 1 
+ 
k

Christos, equally­famed 6.042 TA, thinks Ishan isn’t so tough and so he might as well 
try out also. He reasons that n people (including himself) are trying out for k spots. Thus, 
�  � 
the number of ways to select the team is simply: 
n 
k 
Christos and Ishan each correctly counted the number of possible boxing teams; thus, 
�  � 
�  �  �

their answers must be equal.  So we know: 
n − 1 
n − 1 
n
k − 1 
=

This is called Pascal’s Identity.  And we proved it without any algebra!  Instead, we relied 
purely on counting techniques. 

5.2  Combinatorial Proof 

A  combinatorial  proof  is  an  argument  that  establishes  an  algebraic  fact  by  relying  on 
counting principles. Many such proofs follow the same basic outline: 

1.  Deﬁne a set S . 
2.  Show that |S | =  n by counting one way. 
3.  Show that |S | =  m by counting another way. 
4.  Conclude that n =  m.

In  the  preceding  example,  S  was  the  set  of  all  possible  Olympic  boxing  teams.  Ishan 
computed |S | =  n−1  +  n−1  by counting one way, and Christos computed |S | = 
n
by
k−1 
k
k
counting another. Equating these two expressions gave Pascal’s Identity. 
More typically, the set S is deﬁned in terms of simple sequences or sets rather than an 
elaborate story. Here is less­colorful example of a combinatorial argument.

Theorem 3. 

Proof.  We give a combinatorial proof.  Let S be all n­card hands  that can be dealt  from a 
deck containing n red cards (numbered 1, . . . , n) and 2n black cards (numbered 1, . . . , 2n).

First, note that every 3n­element set has

From another perspective, the number of hands with exactly r  red cards is

since there are  ways to choose the r  red cards and  n−r  ways to choose the n  − r  black

n­card hands is:

2n 
n  − r
S =

Equating these two expressions for |S | proves the theorem. 

Combinatorial proofs are almost magical. Theorem 3 looks pretty scary, but we proved 
it  without  any  algebraic  manipulations  at  all.  The  key  to  constructing  a  combinatorial 
� � 
proof  is  choosing  the  set  S  properly, which  can  be  tricky.  Generally,  the  simpler  side  of 
the equation should provide some guidance.  For example, the right side of Theorem 3 is 
3n  , which suggests choosing S  to be all n­element subsets of some 3n­element set.
