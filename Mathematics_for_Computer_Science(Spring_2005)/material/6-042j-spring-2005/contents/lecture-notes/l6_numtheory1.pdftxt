Number Theory I 

Number theory is the study of the integers. Number theory is right at the core of math­
ematics; even Ug the Caveman surely had some grasp of the integers— at least the posi­
tive ones.  In  fact,  the  integers are  so elementary  that one might ask,  “What’s  to  study?” 
There’s  0,  there’s  1,  2,  3  and  so  on,  and  there’s  the  negatives.  Which  one  don’t  you  un­
√
derstand? Doesn’t math become easy when we don’t have to worry about nasty numbers 
like 
7, 1/π , and i? We can even forget about fractions! 
All the variables in these notes represent integers. 

1  Divisibility 

The true nature of number theory emerges from the ﬁrst deﬁnition. We say that a  divides 
b  if there is an integer k  such that ak  =  b. This is denoted a  | b.  For example: 
7 · 
7 | 63  because 
9 =  63 
A consequence of this deﬁnition is that every number divides zero since a · 0 =  0 for every 
integer a.  If a  divides b, then b   is a multiple of a.  For example, 63 is a multiple of 7. 
This  seems  simple  enough,  but  let’s  play with  this  deﬁnition.  The  Pythagoreans,  an 
ancient  sect  of  mathemtical  mystics,  said  that  a  number  is  perfect  if  it  equals  the  sum 
of  its  positive  integeral  divisors,  excluding  itself.  For  example,  6  = 1 + 2 + 3 and  28   =  
1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14   are  perfect  numbers.  On  the  other  hand,  10  is  not  perfect  because 
1 + 2 + 5 =  8, and 12 is not perfect because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 =  16. Euclid characterized all 
the even perfect numbers around 300 BC. But is there an odd perfect number?  More than 
two  thousand years  later, we still don’t know!  All numbers up  to about 10300  have been 
ruled out, but no one has proved that there isn’t an odd perfect number waiting just over 
the horizon. 
So a half­page into number theory, we’ve strayed past the outer limits of human knowl­
edge.  This  is pretty  typical;  number  theory  is  full of questions  that are easy  to pose, but 
incredibly difﬁcult to answer.  Interestingly, computer scientists have found ways to turn 
these  difﬁculties  to  their  advantage.  Every  time  you  buy  a  book  from  Amazon,  check 
your  grades  on  WebSIS,  or  use  a  PayPal  account,  you  are  relying  on  number  theoretic 
algorithms. 
DON’T PANIC— we’re going to stick to some relatively benign parts of number theory. 
We won’t put any of these super­hard unsolved problems on exams!

1.1  Facts About Divisibility 

Number Theory I 

The lemma below states some basic facts about divisibility that are not difﬁcult to prove: 

Lemma 1.  The following statements about divisibility hold. 
1.  If a  | b, then a  
| 
bc   for all c.
2.  If a  | b  and b c, then a c.
|
| 
3.  If a  | b  and a c, then a   sb  + tc  for all s  and t.
|
| 
4.  For all c  = 0, a  | b  if and only if ca  cb. 
| 

Proof.  We’ll only prove parts (2) and (4); the other proofs are similar. 
Proof of  (2):  Since a  |  b,  there  exists an  integer k1  such  that ak1  =  b.  Since  b
|
c,  there 
exists an  integer k2  such that bk2  =  c.  Substituting ak1  for b  in the second equation gives 
ak1k2  = c, which implies that a  | c. 
Proof of (4): We must show that a  | b  implies ca  cb   and vice­versa. 
| 
•	 First, suppose a  | b. This means ak  = b  for some k . Multiplying both sides by c  gives 
cak  = cb   for some k . This implies ca  | cb. 
•	 Now, suppose ca  | cb. Then cak  = cb  for some k . We can divide both sides by c  since 
c  is nonzero, so ak   = b  for some k . This means a  | b. 

A  number  p  >  1 with  no  positive  divisors  other  than  1  and  itself  is  called  a  prime. 
Every other number greater than 1 is called composite.  For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 
are all prime, but 4, 6, 8, and 9 are composite.  The number 1 is considered neither prime 
nor  composite.  This  is  just  a  matter  of  deﬁnition,  but  reﬂects  the  fact  that  1  does  not 
behave  like a prime  in many contexts,  such as  the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, 
which we’ll come to shortly. 

1.2  When Divisibility Goes Bad 

As you learned in elementary school, if one number does not evenly divide another, then 
there  is  a  “remainder ”  left  over.  More  precisely,  if  you  divide  n  by  d,  then  you  get  a 
quotient q  and a remainder r . This basic fact is the subject of a useful theorem: 

Theorem 2 (Division Theorem).  Let n  and d  be integers such that d >  0.  Then there exists a 
unique pair of integers q  and r  such that n  = qd  + r  and 0 ≤ r  <  d.

Famous Problems in Number Theory 

Fermat’s Last Theorem  Do there exist positive integers x, y , and z  such that 

n
x  + y n  = z 

n 

for some integer n  >  2?  In a book he was reading around 1630, Fermat claimed 
to  have  a  proof,  but  not  enough  space  in  the  margin  to  write  it  down.  Wiles 
ﬁnally solved the problem in 1994, after seven years of working in secrecy and 
isolation in his attic. 

Goldbach Conjecture  Is every even integer greater than or equal to 4 the sum of two 
primes?  For example, 4 =  2 + 2, 6 =  3 + 3, 8 =  3 + 5, etc.  The conjecture holds 
for all numbers up to 1016 .  In 1939 Schnirelman proved that every even number 
can be written  as  the  sum of not more  than 300,000 primes, which was a  start. 
Today, we know that every even number is the sum of at most 6 primes. 

Twin Prime Conjecture  Are  there  inﬁnitely many primes  p  such  that  p  + 2 is also  a 
prime?  In 1966 Chen showed  that  there are  inﬁnitely many primes p  such  that 
p  + 2 is  the  product  of  at  most  two  primes.  So  the  conjecture  is  known  to  be 
almost true! 

Primality Testing  Is  there  an  efﬁcient  way  to  determine  whether  n  is  prime?  An 
amazingly  simple,  yet  efﬁcient  method  was  ﬁnally  discovered  in  2002  by 
Agrawal, Kayal,  and Saxena.  Their paper began with a quote  from Gauss em­
phasizing  the  importance and antiquity of  the problem even  in his  time—  two 
centuries ago. 

Factoring  Given  the  product  of  two  large  primes  n  =  pq ,  is  there  an  efﬁcient  way 
to recover  the primes p  and q?  The best known algorithm  is  the “number ﬁeld 
seive”, which runs in time proportional to: 

1.9(ln  n)1/3 (ln  ln  n)2/3 
e 

This is infeasible when n   has a couple hundred digits or more. 

4 

Number Theory I 

As an example, suppose that a  =  10  and b  =  2716. Then the quotient is q  =  271  and the 
remainder is r  = 6, since 2716   =  271  · 10  +  6. 
The remainder r  in the Division Theorem is denoted n  rem d.  In other words, n  rem  d 
is  the  remainder when  n  is  divided  by  d.  For  example,  32  rem 5  is  the  remainder when 
32  is divided by 5, which  is 2.  Similarly, −11  rem  7  = 3,  since −11  = (−2)  7 +  3.  There 
· 
is a  rem  operator built into many programming languages.  For example, the expression 
“32 % 5” evaluates to 2 in Java, C, and C++.  However, all these languages treat negative 
numbers strangely. 
There  are  a  couple  naming  problems  related  to  the Division  Theorem.  First,  the  the­
orem  is often called  the “Division Algorithm”,  even  though  it  is not an algorithm  in  the 
modern sense. Second, some people use the notation “mod” (which is short for “modulo”) 
instead of “rem”.  This  is unfortunate, because “mod” has been used by mathematicians 
for centuries  in a confusingly similar context, which we’ll come to shortly.  So we’ll stick 
to  rem  here. 
We’re not going to prove the Division Theorem, but there is an important feature that 
you should notice. The theorem asserts that the quotient q  and remainder r  exist and also 
that these values are unique.  Thus, the Division Theorem is one example of an “existence 
and  uniqueness”  theorem;  there  are many  others.  Not  surprisingly,  the  proof  of  such  a 
theorem always has two parts: 

•	 A proof that something exists, such as the quotient q   and remainder r . 
•	 A  proof  that  nothing  else  ﬁts  the  bill;  that  is,  there  is  no  other  quotient  q �  and  re­
mainder r � . 

We’ll prove a famous “existence and uniqueness” theorem in this way shortly.

2  Die Hard 

5 

Simon:  On  the  fountain,  there  should be 2  jugs,  do you  see  them?  A  5­gallon 
and a 3­gallon.  Fill one of the jugs with exactly 4 gallons of water and place it 
on  the  scale and  the  timer will  stop.  You must be precise;  one ounce more or 
less will result in detonation.  If you’re still alive in 5 minutes, we’ll speak. 
Bruce:  Wait, wait a second.  I don’t get it. Do you get it? 
Samuel:  No. 
Bruce:  Get  the  jugs.  Obviously, we  can’t ﬁll  the  3­gallon  jug with  4 gallons of 
water. 
Samuel:  Obviously. 
Bruce:  All right.  I know, here we go. We ﬁll the 3­gallon jug exactly to the top, 
right? 
Samuel:  Uh­huh. 
Bruce:  Okay, now we pour this 3 gallons into the 5­gallon jug, giving us exactly 
3 gallons in the 5­gallon jug, right? 
Samuel:  Right, then what? 
Bruce:  All right. We take the 3­gallon jug and ﬁll it a third of the way... 
Samuel:  No! He said, “Be precise.” Exactly 4 gallons. 
Bruce:  Shit.  Every  cop within 50 miles  is  running his ass off and  I’m out here 
playing kids games in the park. 
Samuel:  Hey, you want to focus on the problem at hand? 

This  is  from  the  movie  Die  Hard  3:  With  a  Vengeance.  Samuel  L.  Jackson  and  Bruce 
Willis have  to disarm a bomb planted by  the diabolical Simon Gruber.  Fortunately,  they 
ﬁnd a solution in the nick of time.  (No doubt reading the script helped.)  On the surface, 
Die Hard 3  is  just a B­grade action movie; however,  I  think  the  inner message of  the ﬁlm 
is that everyone should learn at least a little number theory. 

3  Die Once and For All 

Unfortunately, Hollywood never  lets go of a gimmick.  They’re planning  to keep  the Die 
Hard series going with: 

Die Hard 4: Die Hardest  Bruce goes on vacation and— shockingly— happens into a ter­
rorist plot. To save the day, he must make 3 gallons using 21 and 26 gallon jugs. 

6 

Number Theory I 

Die Hard 5: Die of Old Age  Bruce must  save his assisted  living  facility  from a  criminal 
mastermind by forming 2 gallons with 899 and 1147 gallon jugs. 

Die Hard 6: Die Once and For All  Bruce has to make 4 gallons using 3 and 6­gallon jugs. 

It would be nice if we could solve all these silly water jug questions at once.  In particular, 
how can one form g  gallons using jugs with capacities a  and b? 
That’s where number theory comes in handy. 

3.1  Finding an Invariant Property 

Suppose  that we have water  jugs with capacities a  and b.  Let’s carry out a  few arbitrary 
operations and see what happens. The state of the system at each step is described below 
with a pair of numbers  (x,   y), where x  is  the amount of water  in  the  jug with  capacity a 
and y  is the amount in the jug with capacity b. 
(0,  0)  → (a,  0) 
→ (0,  a) 
→ (a,  a) 
→ (2a  − b,   b) 
→ (2a  − b,   0) 
→ (0,  2a  − b) 
→ (a,  2a  − b) 
→ (3a  − 2b,  b) 

ﬁll ﬁrst jug 
pour ﬁrst into second 
ﬁll ﬁrst jug 
pour ﬁrst into second 
empty second jug

pour ﬁrst into second 

Of course, we’re making  some assumptions about  the  relative capacities of  the  two  jugs 
here.  But another point leaps out:  at every step, the amount of water in each jug is of the 
form 
·
· 
s a  +  t b
for some  integers s  and  t.  An expression of  this  form  is called a  linear combination of a 
and b. This sounds like an assertion that we might be able to prove by induction! 

Lemma 3.  Suppose that we have water jugs with capacities a  and b. Then the amount of water in 
each jug is always a linear combination of a  and b. 

Proof.  We  use  induction.  Let  P (n)  be  the  proposition  that  after  n  steps,  the  amount  of 
water in each jug is a linear combination of a  and b. 
·
· 
Base case. P (0) is true, because both jugs are initially empty, and 0  a  +  0  b  = 0.
Inductive step.  Now we must show that P (n)  implies P (n  +  1)  for n  ≥  0.  So assume that 
after n  steps the amount of water in each jug is a linear combination of a  and b.  There are 
two cases: 

Number Theory I 	

7 

•	 If we  ﬁll  a  jug  from  the  fountain  or  empty  a  jug  into  the  fountain,  then  that  jug  is 
empty or full.  The amount in the other jug remains a linear combination of a  and b. 
So P (n   +  1) holds. 

•	 Otherwise, we pour water from one jug to another until one is empty or the other is 
full.  By our assumption,  the amount  in each  jug  is a  linear  combination of a  and  b 
before we begin pouring: 

s1  · a  +  t1  · 
b
s2  · a  +  t2  · 
b

j1  = 
j2  = 

After  pouring,  one  jug  is  either  empty  (contains  0  gallons)  or  full  (contains  a  or  b 
gallons). Thus, the other jug contains either j1  +  j2  gallons, j1  +  j2  − a, or j1  +  j2  − b 
gallons, all of which are linear combinations of a  and b. 

The claim follows by the principle of induction. 

This theorem has an important corollary. 

Corollary 4.  Bruce dies. 

Proof.  In Die Hard 6, Bruce has water jugs with capacities 3 and 6 and must form 4 gallons 
of water. However, the amount in each jug is always of the form 3s + 6t  by Lemma 3. This 
is always a multiple of 3 by part (3) of Lemma 1, so he can not measure out 4 gallons. 

Lemma  3  isn’t  very  satisfying.  We’ve  just  managed  to  recast  a  pretty  understand­
able  question  about  water  jugs  into  a  complicated  question  about  linear  combinations. 
This might not seem like progress.  Fortunately, linear combinations are closely related to 
something more familiar and that will help us solve the water jug problem. 

4  The Greatest Common Divisor 

The greatest common divisor of a  and b  is exactly what you’d guess:  the largest number 
that is a divisor of both a  and b.  It is denoted gcd(a,   b).  For example, gcd(18,  24) = 6. 
Probably  some  junior  high  math  teacher  made  you  compute  greatest  common  divi­
sors  for no apparent reason until you were blue  in  the  face.  But, amazingly,  the greatest 
common  divisor  actually  turns  out  to  be  quite  useful  for  reasoning  about  the  integers. 
Speciﬁcally,  the  quantity  gcd(a,   b)  is  a  valuable  piece  of  information  about  the  relation­
ship  between  the  numbers  a  and  b.  So  we’ll  make  arguments  about  greatest  common 
divisors all the time. 

8 

Number Theory I 

4.1  Linear Combinations and the GCD 

The theorem below relates the greatest common divisor to linear combinations.  This the­
orem is very useful; take the time to understand it and then remember it! 

Theorem 5.  The greatest common divisor of a  and b  is equal to the smallest positive linear com­
bination of a  and b. 

For example,  the greatest common divisor of 52 and 44  is 4.  And,  sure enough, 4  is a 
linear combination of 52 and 44: 

6  · 52  +  (−7)  44  = 4
· 

Furthermore, no linear combination of 52 and 44 is equal to a smaller positive integer. 

a|

Proof.  Let m  be the smallest positive linear combination of a  and b.  We’ll prove that m  = 
gcd(a,  b) by showing both gcd(a,  b)  ≤ m  and m  ≤ gcd(a,  b). 
First,  we  show  that  gcd(a,   b)  ≤  m.  By  the  deﬁnition  of  common  divisor,  gcd(a,  b)  
and gcd(a,   b)  | b. Therefore, for every pair of integers s  and t: 
gcd(a,  b) | sa  +  tb 
Thus, in particular, gcd(a,  b) divides m, and so gcd(a,   b) ≤ m. 
Now,  we  show  that m  ≤  gcd(a,  b).  We  do  this  by  showing  that m  |  a.  A  symmetric 
argument shows that m  | b, which means that m  is a common divisor of a  and b.  Thus, m 
must be less than or equal to the greatest common divisor of a  and b. 
All  that remains  is  to show  that m  |  a.  By  the Division Algorithm,  there exists a quo­
tient q  and remainder r  such that: 
· 
a  =  q m  +  r 

(where 0  ≤ r  < m)

Recall  that m  =  sa  +  tb   for  some  integers  s  and  t.  Subtituting  in  for m  and  rearranging 
terms gives: 

a  =  q  · (sa  +  tb) +  r 
r  = (1  − qs)a  +  (−q t)b 

We’ve  just  expressed  r  as  a  linear  combination  of  a  and  b.  However,  m  is  the  smallest 
positive linear combination and 0  ≤ r  < m. The only possibility is that the remainder r  is

not positive; that is, r  = 0. This implies m  | a. 

The  proof  notes  that  every  linear  combination  of  a  and  b  is  a  multiple  of  gcd(a,  b). 
Conversely, since gcd(a,   b) is a linear combination of a  and b, every multiple of gcd(a,  b) is 
as well. This establishes a corollary: 

Number Theory I

Corollary 6.  Every linear combination of a  and b  is a multiple of gcd(a,  b) and vice versa. 

Now we can restate the water jugs lemma in terms of the greatest common divisor: 
Corollary 7.  Suppose that we have water jugs with capacities a  and b. Then the amount of water 
in each jug is always a multiple of gcd(a,  b). 

For example,  there is no way to form 4 gallons using 3 and 6 gallon  jugs, because 4 is 
not a multiple of gcd(3,  6)  = 3. 

4.2  Properties of the Greatest Common Divisor 

We  claimed  that  greatest  common  divisors  are  powerful  tools  for  reasoning  about  the 
integers.  So we’ll often make use of some basic gcd   facts: 
Lemma 8.  The following statements about the greatest common divisor hold: 

1.  Every common divisor of a   and b  divides gcd(a,  b). 
2.  gcd(ka,  kb) =  k  · gcd(a,  b) for all k >  0. 
3.  If gcd(a,  b)  = 1  and gcd(a,  c) = 1, then gcd(a,  bc)   = 1. 
4.  If a  | bc   and gcd(a,  b)  = 1, then a c.
| 
5.  gcd(a,  b)  =  gcd(b,   a  rem  b). 

Here’s the trick to proving these statements:  translate the gcd  world to the linear com­
bination  world  using  Theorem  5,  argue  about  linear  combinations,  and  then  translate 
back using Theorem 5 again. 

Proof.  We prove only parts (3) and (4). 
Proof of (3):  The assumptions together with Theorem 5 imply that there exist integers 
s, t, u, and v  such that: 

sa  +  tb  = 1 
ua  +  vc  = 1 

Multiplying these two equations gives: 

(sa  +  tb)(ua  +  vc) = 1 
The left side can be rewritten as a  · (asu  + btu  + csv) + b c(tv). This is a linear combination 
· 
of a  and bc  that is equal to 1, so gcd(a,  bc)  = 1  by Theorem 5. 
Proof of (4):  Theorem 5 says that gcd(ac,  bc)  is equal to a linear combination of ac  and 
bc.  Now  a  |  ac  trivially  and  a  |  bc  by  assumption.  Therefore,  a  divides  every  linear 
combination of ac  and bc.  In particular,  a  divides gcd(ac,  bc) =  c  · gcd(a,  b) =  c.  The ﬁrst 
equality uses part (2) of this lemma, and the second uses the assumption that gcd(a,  b) = 
1. 

10 

Number Theory I 

Part (5) of  the  lemma  is useful  for quickly computing  the greatest common divisor of 
two numbers.  For example, we could compute the greatest common divisor of 1147 and 
899 by repeatedly applying part(5): 
�� 
� 
� 
gcd(1247,  899)   = gcd(899,  1247  rem  899) 
�� 
� 
� 
=248 
=  gcd(248,  899  rem  248)  
�� 
� 
� 
=155 
=  gcd(155,  248  rem  155) 
�� 
� 
� 
=93 
=  gcd(93,  155  rem  93)  
� 
�� 
� 
=62 
=  gcd(62,  93  rem  62)  
�� 
� 
� 
=31 
=  gcd(31,  62  rem  31)  
=0 
=  gcd(31,  0) 
=  31 

This is called Euclid’s algorithm.  The last equation might look wrong, but 31 is a divisor 
of both 31 and 0 since every integer divides 0. 
This calculation, together with Corollary 7, implies that there is no way to measure out 
2 gallons of water using  jugs with capacities 1247 and 899; we can only obtain multiples 
of 31 gallons. This is good news– Bruce won’t even survive Die Hard 5! 
Let’s  see  if  Bruce  can  possibly make  3  gallons  using  21  and  26­gallon  jugs.  First,  we 
compute the greatest common divisorof 21 and 26 using Euclid’s algorithm: 

gcd(26,  21)   =  gcd(21,  5)  = gcd(5,  1)  = 1 

Now 3 is a multiple of 1, so we can’t rule out the possibility that Bruce can form 3 gallons. 
On the other hand, we don’t know he can do it either. 

4.3  One Solution for All Water Jug Problems 

Can  Bruce  form  3  gallons  using  21  and  26­gallon  jugs?  This  question  is  not  so  easy  to 
answer without some number theory. 
Corollary 6 says that 3 can be written as a linear combination of 21 and 26, since 3 is a 
multiple of gcd(21,  26)  = 1.  In other words, there exist integers s  and t  such that: 
·
· 
3 =  s  21  +  t  26

We don’t know what the coefﬁcients s  and t  are, but we do know that they exist. 

Number Theory I 	

11 

Now  the  coefﬁcient  s  could  be  either  positive  or  negative.  However,  we  can  readily 
transform this linear combination into an equivalent linear combination 

·
· 
3 =  s�  21  +  t�  26

where the coefﬁcient s�  is positive.  The trick is to notice that if we increase s  by 26 in the 
original  equation  and  decrease  t  by  21,  then  the  value  of  the  expression  s  · 21  +  t  26   is
· 
unchanged  overall.  Thus,  by  repeatedly  increasing  the  value  of  s  (by  26  at  a  time)  and 
·
· 
decreasing  the value of  t  (by 21 at  a  time), we get a  linear  combination  s�  21  +  t�  26   =  
3  where  the  coefﬁcient  s�  is  positive.  Notice  that  t�  must  be  negative;  otherwise,  this 
expression would be much greater than 3. 

Now here’s how to form 3 gallons using jugs with capacities 21 and 26: 

•	 Repeat s�  times: 

–	 Fill the 21­gallon jug. 

–	 Pour  all  the  water  in  the  21­gallon  jug  into  the  26­gallon  jug.  Whenever  the 
26­gallon jug becomes full, empty it out. 

At the end of this process, there must be exactly 3 gallons in the 26­gallon jug! Here’s why: 
· 
we’ve taken s�  21   gallons of water from the fountain, we’ve poured out some multiple of 
26 gallons, and  in  the end  the 26­gallon  jug holds somewhere between 0 and 26 gallons. 
Furthermore, we know: 

·
· 
s�  21  +  t�  26  = 3

Thus,  we  must  have  emptied  the  26­gallon  jug  exactly  −t�  times;  if  we  had  emptied  it 
fewer  times,  then  there woule  be more  than  26  gallons  left.  And we  did  not withdraw 
enough water from the fountain to empty the 26­gallon jug more than −t�  times. Thus, by 
the equation above, there must be exactly 3 gallons left. 
Remarkably, we don’t even need to know the coefﬁcients s�  and t�  in order to use this 
strategy!  Instead of repeating the outer loop s�  times, we could just repeat until we obtain 
3  gallons,  since  that  must  happen  eventually.  Of  course,  we  have  to  keep  track  of  the 
amounts in the two jugs so we know when we’re done. Here’s the solution that approach

The  same  approach  works  regardless  of  the  jug  capacities  and  even  regardless  the 
amount we’re trying to produce!  Simply proceed as follows: 

•	 Repeat until the desired amount of water is obtained: 

–	 Fill the smaller jug. 
–	 Pour  all  the water  in  the  smaller  jug  into  the  larger  jug.  Whenever  the  larger 
jug becomes full, empty it out. 

By the same reasoning as before, this method eventually generates every multiple of the 
greatest  common  divisor  of  the  jug  capacities—  all  the  quantities  we  can  possibly  pro­
duce. No ingenuity is needed at all! 

5  The Fundamental Theorem of Arithemtic 

We now have almost enough tools to prove something that you probably already know. 
Theorem (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic).  Every positive integer n can be written in 
a unique way as a product of primes: 
· 
· · · pj 
n  =  p1  p2	

(p1  ≤ p2  ≤  . . .  ≤ pj )

Notice  that  the  theorem would be  false  if 1 were considered a prime;  for example,  15

could be written as 3 5  or 1 3 5  or 12  3 5. Also, we’re relying on a standard convention: 
the product of an empty set of numbers is deﬁned to be 1, much as the sum of an empty 
set of numbers is deﬁned to be 0. Without this convention, the theorem would be false for 
n = 1. 
There is a certain wonder in the Fundamental Theorem, even if you’ve known it since 
the crib.  Primes show up erratically in the sequence of integers.  In fact, their distribution 
seems almost random: 

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, . . . 

Basic  questions  about  this  sequence have  stumped humanity  for  centuries.  And  yet we 
know  that  every  natural  number  can  be  built  up  from  primes  in  exactly  one  way.  These 
quirky  numbers  are  the  building  blocks  for  the  integers.  The  Fundamental  Theorem  is 
not hard to prove, but we’ll need a couple preliminary facts. 
Lemma 9.  If p is a prime and p | ab, then p a or p b.
|
| 

Proof.  The  greatest  common divisor  of  a  and  p must  be  either  1  or  p,  since  these  are  the 
only  divisors  of  p.  If  gcd(a, p) =  p,  then  the  claim  holds,  because  a  is  a  multiple  of  p. 
Otherwise, gcd(a, p) = 1  and so p | b by part (4) of Lemma 8. 

A routine induction argument extends this statement to the fact we assumed last time: 
Lemma 10.  Let p be a prime.  If p | a1a2  . . . an , then p divides some ai . 

Now we’re ready to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Arithemtic. 

Theorem 11 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic).  Every positive integer n can be written 
in a unique way as a product of primes: 
· p2  · · · pj 

(p1  ≤ p2  ≤  . . .  ≤ pj )

n  =  p1 

Proof.  We must prove two things:  (1) every positive integer can be expressed as a product 
of primes, and (2) this expression is unique. 
First,  we  use  strong  induction  to  prove  that  every  positive  integer  n  is  a  product  of 
primes. As a base case, n = 1  is the product of the empty set of primes.  For the inductive 
step,  suppose  that  every  k  <  n   is  a  product  of  primes.  We  must  show  that  n  is  also 
a  product  of  primes.  If  n  is  itself  prime,  then  this  is  true  trivially.  Otherwise,  n  =  ab 
for  some  a, b   <  n.  By  the  induction  assumption,  a  and  b are  both  products  of  primes. 
Therefore, a · b =  n is also a product of primes. Thus, the claim is proved by induction. 
Second, we use the well­ordering principle to prove that every positive integer can be 
written  as  a product  of primes  in  a unique way.  The proof  is  by  contradiction:  assume, 
contrary to the claim,  that there exist positive integers that can be written as products of

Number Theory I


The Prime Number Theorem 
Let π(x) denote the number of primes less than or equal to x. For example, π(10)  = 
4  because  2,  3,  5,  and  7  are  the  primes  less  than  or  equal  to  10.  Primes  are  very 
irregularly  distributed,  so  the  growth  of  π  is  similarly  erratic.  However,  the  Prime 
Number Theorem give an approximate answer: 

lim 
x→∞ 

π(x)
x/ ln   x

= 1 

Thus, primes gradually taper off. As a rule of thumb, about 1 integer out of every ln  x 
in the vicinity of x is a prime. 
The Prime Number Theorem was conjectured by Legendre  in 1798 and proved a 
century later by de la Vallee Poussin and Hadamard in 1896. However, after his death, 
a notebook of Gauss was found to contain the same conjecture, which he apparently 
made  in  1791  at  age  15.  (You  sort  of  have  to  feel  sorry  for  all  the  otherwise  “great” 
mathematicans who had the misfortune of being contemporaries of Gauss.)

ﬁrst 10­digit prime found 
in consecutive digits of e 

Substituting the correct number for the expression in curly­braces produced the URL 
for  a Google  employment  page.  The  idea was  that  Google was  interested  in  hiring 
the sort of people that could and would solve such a problem. 
How hard is this problem? Would you have to look through thousands or millions 
or billions of digits of e to ﬁnd a 10­digit prime?  The rule of thumb dervied from the 
Prime Number Theorem says that among 10­digit numbers, about 1 in 
ln   1010  ≈ 23 

is  prime.  This  suggests  that  the  problem  isn’t  really  so  hard!  Sure  enough,  the  ﬁrst 
10­digit prime in consecutive digits of e appears quite early:

primes  in more  than one way.  By  the well­ordering principle,  there  is a  smallest  integer 
with this property. Call this integer n, and let 
n  =  p1  · p2  · · · pj 
=  q1  · q2  · · · qk 
be  two  of  the  (possibly many) ways  to write  n  as  a  product  of  primes.  Then  p1  |  n  and 
so p1  |  q1q2  · · · qk .  Lemma 10 implies that p1  divides one of the primes qi .  But since qi  is a 
prime,  it must be that p1  =  qi .  Deleting p1  from the ﬁrst product and qi  from the second, 
we ﬁnd that n/p1  is a positive integer smaller than n  that can also be written as a product 
of primes in two distinct ways. But this contradicts the deﬁnition of n  as the smallest such 
positive integer.
