Closed Forms 

NOTE:  For  this  exam,  a  “closed  form”  is  a mathematical  ex­
pression without summation notation, product notation, or the 
. . . symbol.  Factorials and binomial coefﬁcients may appear in 
a closed form.  Some examples are shown below.

Problem  4.  [15  points] A misguided MIT  student  designs  a  self­replicating  6.270  robot. 
The  student builds one  such  robot every day,  starting on day 0.  The day after a  robot  is 
built, it constructs two copies of itself.  (On all subsequent days, the robot busily searches 
for ping­pong balls— these are 6.270 robots, after all.) Here is what happens over the ﬁrst 
few days: 

Day 0.  The student builds robot R1 . 

Day 1.  The student builds robot R2 . Robot R1  builds robots R3  and R4 . 

Day 2.  The student builds R5 . Robot R2  builds R6  and R7 , robot R3  builds R8  and R9 , and 
robot R4  builds R10  and R11 . Robot R1  searches for ping­pong balls. 

Day 3.  The  student builds R12 .  Robots R5 , . . . , R11  build  robots R13 , . . . , R26 .  Robots R1 , 
R2 , R3 , and R4  search for ping­pong balls. 

Let  Tn  be  the  number  of  robots  in  existence  at  the  end  of  day  n.  Thus,  T0  = 1,  T1  = 4, 
T2  =  11, and T3  =  26. 

(a)	 How many new robots are built on day n − 1?  Express your answer  in  terms of 
the variables Tn−1 , Tn−2 , . . .   and assume n ≥ 2. 
Solution.  This  is  the difference between the number that existed on day n − 1  and 
the number that existed on day n − 2, which is Tn−1  − Tn−2 . 
(b)	 Express Tn  with a recurrence equation and sufﬁcient base cases. Do not solve the 
recurrence. 
Solution.  The number of  robots on day n  is  equal  to  the number of  robots on day 
n − 1, plus twice the number of robots built yesterday (Tn−1  − Tn−2 ), plus the 1 robot 
built by the student. Therefore, we have: 

T0  = 1 
T1  = 4 
Tn  = 3Tn−1  − 2Tn−2  +  1 

(for n ≥ 2)

(c)	 An even more misguided 6.270 student designs another self­replicating robot  to 
hunt down and destroy  robots of  the ﬁrst kind.  The number of  these  robots at  the 
end of day n  is Pn , where: 

P0  =  0 
P1  =  1 
Pn  =  5Pn−1  − 6Pn−2  + 1 

(for n  ≥ 2) 

Find  a  closed­form  expression  for  Pn .  Show  your  work  clearly  to  be  eligible  for 
partial credit. 

Solution.  The  characteristic  equation  is  x − 5x  + 6  = 0.  The  right  side  factors  into 
2
(x  − 2)(x   − 3),  so  the roots are 2 and 3.  For a particular solution,  let’s ﬁrst guess Pn  =  c. 
Substituting  this  into  the  recurrence  equation  gives  c  =  5c  − 6c  + 1,  which  implies  that 
c  =  1/2. Therefore, the general form of the solution is: 
·
· 
Pn  =  A  2n  + B  3n  + 1/2

Substituting P0  =  0 and P1  =  1 gives the equations: 

0 =  A  + B  + 1/2 
1 =  2A  + 3B  + 1/2 
Solving this system gives A  =  −2 and B  =  3/2. Therefore, the solution is: 
· 
Pn  =  −2 · 2n  +
3n  + 1/2

Problem  5.  [20  points]  Solve  the  following  counting  problems.  Your  answers  must  be 
closed  forms,  but  need  not  be  simpliﬁed.  In  particular,  you  may  leave  factorials  and 
binomial coefﬁcients  in your answers.  To be eligible  for partial credit, you must explain 
how you arrived at your answer. 

(a)	 Four card players (Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave) are each dealt a 7­card hand from 
a 52­card deck.  In how many different ways can this be done? 
Solution.  There  is  a  bijection with  52­symbol  sequences  containing  7 A’s,  7  B’s,  7 
C’s, 7 D’s and 24 X’s (indicating cards that remain in the deck). Thus, the number of 
ways to deal out the cards is

by the Bookkeeper Rule. 

(b)	 Stinky  Peterson  has  decided  to  start  a  Bug  Farm  under  his  bed.  He  plans  to 
raise  100  bugs  selected  from  four  basic  varieties:  creepy,  crawly,  fuzzy,  and  slimey. 
Assuming he wants at least 10 speciments of each, how many different distributions 
are  possible?  (For  example,  one  possible  distribution  is  20  creepy,  20  crawly,  10 
fuzzy, and 50 slimey.) 
Solution.  First,  he  places  10  specimens  of  each  under  his  bed.  Then  he  must  se­
lect  the  remaining 60 additional  speciments  from  the  four kinds of bug.  There  is a 
� � 
bijection  between  such  selections  and  63­bit  sequences with  exactly  3  ones,  so  the 
number of distributions is

(c)	 There are n  runners  in a race.  Before the race, each runner  is assigned a number 
between 1 and n.  The  runners  can ﬁnish  the  race  in any one of n!  different orders. 
In how many of these orders is the ﬁrst ﬁnisher not #1, the second ﬁnisher not #2, 
and the third ﬁnisher not #3? 
Solution.  Let  Pk  be  the  set  of  ﬁnishing  orders  in  which  runner  #k  is  is  the  k ­th 
ﬁnisher.  In these terms, the solution is: 
n!  −  P1  ∪ P2  ∪ P3 =  n!  − ( P1 +  P2 +  P3

(e)	 A mobile  is a hanging  structure built  from  seven horizontal  rods  (indicated with

Many  different  toy  arrangements  can  be  obtained  by  twisting  the  strings.  For  ex­
ample,  twisting  the  string  marked  with  the  →  arrow  would  swap  toys  A  and  B. 
Twisting  the  string  marked  with  the  ←  arrow  would  reverse  the  order  of  toys  E, 
F, G,  and H.  On  the  other  hand,  no  combination  of  twists  swaps  only  toys  B  and 
C. Two mobiles are different  if one  can not be obtained  from  the other by  twisting 
strings. How many different mobiles are possible? 
Solution.  There  are  8!   different  sequences  of  toys.  Each mobile  can  be  conﬁgured 
in 27  different ways, by  twisting or not  twisting  the 7 upper  strings.  Thus,  there  is 
a 27 ­to­1 mapping from sequences to mobiles.  By the Division Rule, the number of 
different mobiles is 8!/27  =  315.

Problem 6.  [15 points] A subsequence is obtained from a sequence by deleting one or more 
terms.  For example, the sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) contains (2, 4, 5) as a subsequence. 

Theorem.  Every sequence of n2  + 1 distinct integers contains an increasing or decreasing subse­
quence of length n + 1. 

For example, in the 32 +1 =  10 term sequence (5, 6, 1, 4, 9, 0, 2, 7, 8, 3), the underlined terms 
form  an  increasing  sequence  of  length  3 + 1  = 4.  Fill  in  the  outline  of  a proof provided 
below. 
Proof. 

(a)	 Label each term  in the sequence with the  length of the  longest  increasing subse­
quence  that  ends  with  that  term.  For  example,  here  is  a  sequence  with  the  corre­
ponding labels listed below.

Solution. 

1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3 

(b)	 Now there are two cases.  If some term is labeled n + 1 or higher, then the theorem 
is true because 
Solution.  this  means  there  is  an  increasing  sequence  of  length  at  least  n + 1 that 
ends with that term. 
(c)  Otherwise, at least n + 1 terms must have the same label b ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} because 
Solution.  of the Pigeonhole Principle. Regard the labels a pigeons and the numbers 
1, 2, . . . , n   as  pigeonholes.  Assign  each  label  to  its  value.  Since  there  are  n2  + 1  
pigeons and only n pigeonholes, some n + 1 pigeons must be assigned to some hole 
b. 

(d)  The theorem is also true in this case because 
Solution.  Each  of  the  n + 1 terms  labeled  b must  be  smaller  than  the  one  before. 
(Otherwise, a term labeled b could be appended to the length­b increasing sequence 
that ends at its predecessor to obtain a length­(b + 1) increasing sequence.  But then 
the term should actually be labeled b + 1.) Therefore, the n + 1 terms labeled b form 
a decreasing subsequence.

Problem 7.  [15 points] Every day in the life of Dangerous Dan is a potential disaster: 

•  Dan may or may not spill his breakfast cereal on his computer keyboard. 

•  Dan may or may not fall down the front steps on his way out the door. 

•  Dan stubs his toe zero or more times. 

•  Dan blurts something foolish an even number of times. 

Let Tn  be  the number of different  combinations of n mishaps Dan  can  suffer  in one day. 
For example, T3  = 7, because there are seven possible combinations of three mishaps: 
spills  0  1  0  1  1  0  0 
falls  0  0  1  1  0  1  0 
stubs  3  2  2  1  0  0  1 
blurts  0  0  0  0  2  2  2 
(a)  Give a generating function g(x) for the sequence {T0 , T1 , T2 , . . .}. 
Solution.  We multiply the generating functions for spills (1 + x), falls (1 + x), stubs 
(1 + x + x2  + . . .   = 1/(1 − x)), and blurts (1 + x2  + x4  + . . .  = 1/(1 − x2 )):
