(a) Consider the proposition:
R = “For all x ∈ S , P (x) implies Q(x).”

For each statement below:
• If R implies that statement, then circle ⇒.
• If R is implied by that statement, then circle ⇐.
Thus, you might circle zero, one, or two arrows next to each statement. (Circle only
implications that hold for all sets S and all predicates P and Q.)

(b) Let S be the set of all people, and let M (x, y) be the predicate, “x is the mother of
y”. Translate this proposition into a clear English sentence involving no variables.
∀x (¬∃y (M (x, y) ∧ M (y , x)))

“There are no two people such that each is the mother of the other.” Or,
more simply, “No one is their own maternal grandmother.”

(c) Translate the following English sentence into logic notation using the set S and
predicate M deﬁned above.

“Everyone has a mother.”

Problem 2. [15 points] Complete this proof that n cents of postage can be formed using 3
and 5 cent stamps for all n ≥ 8.

Proof. We use strong induction.

(a) Let P (n) be the proposition that
Solution. n cents of postage can be formed using 3 and 5 cent stamps.

(b) Base cases.
Solution. P (8), P (9), and P (10) are all true, since:

8 = 5 + 3
9 = 3 + 3 + 3
10 = 5 + 5

(c) Inductive step.
Solution. For n ≥ 10, we assume P (8), . . . , P (n) and prove P (n + 1). In particular,
by assumption P (n − 2), we can form n − 2 cents of postage. Adding a 3-cent stamp
gives n + 1 cents of postage, so P (n + 1) is true.

So P (n) is true for all n ≥ 8 by the principle of strong induction.

(b) Suppose that G0 is an undirected graph with an Euler tour. Also, suppose G1 is
obtained by tweaking G0 , G2 by tweaking G1 , and so forth. Use induction to prove
that every graph Gn obtainable in this way has an Euler tour.
For your reference:

• An Euler tour is a closed walk that traverses every edge in a graph exactly once.
• A graph is connected if and only if there is a path between every pair of vertices.
• Theorem. An undirected graph has an Euler tour if and only if the graph is
connected and every vertex has even degree.

Solution. We use induction. Let P (n) be the proposition that Gn has an Euler tour.
Base case. G0 has an Euler tour by supposition.
Inductive step. For n ≥ 0, we assume Gn has an Euler Tour and prove that Gn+1 also
has an Euler tour. Speciﬁcally, we show that Gn+1 has only even-degree vertices and
is connected:

• Every vertex in Gn has even degree, since Gn has an Euler tour. Every vertex
in Gn+1 has the same degree, except for vertex a which has degree two greater.
Thus, every vertex in Gn+1 has even degree.
• Consider arbitrary vertices u and v in Gn+1 . Since Gn is connected, there is a
path from u to v in Gn . If the path does not contain c—d, then the same path
exists in Gn+1 . If the path does contain c—d, then there is a corresponding path
in Gn+1 where c—d is replaced by edges c—a and a—d.

This implies Gn+1 has an Euler tour as well. Therefore, Gn has an Euler tour for all
n ≥ 1. In particular, G6042 has an Euler Tour.

Problem 4. [15 points] Fill in the boxes below. All variables denote integers. No expla-
nations are required, but we can only award partial credit for an incorrect answer if you
show your reasoning.

(a) Suppose x is a multiple of 17. Write the smallest nonnegative integers that make
this statement true.

2x32 − 6x17 + 4x16 − 4x + 6 ≡ 0 · x + 6

(mod 17)

Solution. If x is a multiple of 17, then x ≡ 0 (mod 17). Therefore, all terms involving
x on the left are congruent to zero.

(b) Now suppose x is not a multiple of 17. Write the smallest nonnegative integers
that make this statement true.

2x32 − 6x17 + 4x16 − 4x + 6 ≡ 15 · x + 12
2x32 − 6x17 + 4x16 − 4x + 6 ≡ 2 (cid:0)x16(cid:1)2 − 6x (cid:0)x16(cid:1) + 4x16 − 4x + 6
Solution. By Fermat’s Theorem, x16 ≡ 1 (mod 17). Thus, we can reason as follows:
(mod 17)
≡ 2 − 6x + 4 − 4x + 6
(mod 17)
≡ −2x + 12
(mod 17)
≡ 15x + 12
(mod 17)

(mod 17)

(c) In the box, write the smallest positive integer that makes this statement true:

There exist integers s and t such that
s · 117 + t · 153 = x

if and only if

x ≡ 0

(mod 9 )

Solution. Recall that an integer x is expressible as a linear combination of a and b
if and only if x is a multiple of gcd(a, b), i.e. x ≡ 0 (mod gcd(a, b)). In this case,
Euclid’s algorithm gives:

gcd(153, 117) = gcd(117, 36) = gcd(36, 9) = 9

Problem 5. [15 points] Let p, q , and r be distinct primes. Prove that there exist integers a,
b, and c such that:
a · (pq) + b · (qr) + c · (rp) = 1

(Hint: First, consider linear combinations of just pq and qr .)

Solution. Since gcd(pq , qr) = q , there exist integers s and t such that:

Now gcd(q , rp) = 1, so there exist integers u and v such that:

s(pq) + t(qr) = q

uq + v(rp) = 1

Therefore:

u(s(pq) + t(qr)) + v(rp) = (us)(pq) + (ut)(qr) + v(rp) = 1

Problem 6. [15 points] In a chicken tournament, for every pair of chickens u and v , either
u pecks v or v pecks u, but not both. A king is a chicken u such that for every other chicken
v , either

• u pecks v , or

• u pecks a chicken w and w pecks v .

Complete the proof of the following theorem.

Theorem. If chicken c is pecked, then c is pecked by a king.

Proof. Let Sc be the set of all chickens pecked by c, and let Dc be the set of all chickens that
peck c. The situation is illustrated below:

(Hint: Apply the King Chicken Theorem to Dc .)

If chicken c is pecked, then the set Dc is nonempty. Thus, there is a tournament among
the chickens in Dc , which has a king by the King Chicken Theorem. We will show that d
is actually a king of the original tournament.

• d pecks every chicken in Dc (directly or indirectly), since it is a king of Dc .

• d pecks chicken c directly, since d is in Dc .

• d pecks every chicken in Sc indirectly, since it pecks c and c pecks every chicken in
Sc .
