Problem 1.  [15 points] Consider the following sequence of predicates: 
Q1 (x1 ) = x1 
Q2 (x1 , x2 ) = x1  ⇒ x2 
Q3 (x1 , x2 , x3 ) = (x1  ⇒ x2 ) ⇒ x3 
Q4 (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) = ((x1  ⇒ x2 ) ⇒ x3 ) ⇒ x4 
Q5 (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) = (((x1  ⇒ x2 ) ⇒ x3 ) ⇒ x4 ) ⇒ x5 
. . . 
. . . 
Let  Tn  be  the  number  of  different  true/false  settings  of  the  variables  x1 , x2 , . . . , xn  for 
which Qn (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) is true.  For example, T2  = 3 since Q2 (x1 , x2 ) is true for 3 different 
settings of the variables x1  and x2 : 

Q2 (x1 , x2 )

(a)	 Express Tn+1  in terms of Tn , assuming n ≥ 1. 
Solution. We have: 
Qn+1 (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn+1 ) = Qn (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) ⇒ xn+1 
If  xn+1  is  true,  then Qn+1  is  true  for  all  2n  settings  of  the  variables  x1 , x2 , . . . , xn .  If 
xn+1  is false, then Qn+1  is true for all settings of x1 , x2 , . . . , xn  except for the Tn  settings 
that make Qn  true. Thus, altogether we have: 
Tn+1  = 2n  + 2 − Tn  = 2n+1  − Tn 
n
(b)	 Use  induction  to  prove  that  Tn  =  3 (2n+1  + (−1)n )  for  n  ≥  1.  You may  assume 
1
your answer to the previous part without proof. 
Solution.  The proof is by induction.  Let P (n) be the proposition that Tn  =  (2
n+1  +
(−1)n )/3.

Base  case:  There  is  a  single  setting  of  x1  that  makes  Q1 (x1 )  =  x1  true,  and  T1  =

(21+1  + (−1)1 )/3 = 1. Therefore, P (0) is true. 

Inductive step:  For n ≥ 0, we assume P (n) and reason as follows: 

� 
� 
n− T
Tn+1  = 2n+1

2n+1  + (−1)
n
= 2n+1  − 
3 
2n+2  + (−1)
n+1
3 
The  ﬁrst  step  uses  the  result  from  the  previous  problem  part,  the  second  uses  the 
induction hypothesis P (n), and the third is simpliﬁcation. This implies that P (n + 1) 
is true. By the principle of induction, P (n) is true for all n ≥ 1.

Problem 2.  [10 points] There is no clock in my kitchen. However: 

•  The faucet drips every 54 seconds after I shut off the water. 

•  The toaster pops out toast every 87 seconds after I plug it in. 

I’d  like  to  fry an  egg  for  exactly 141  seconds.  My plan  is  to plug  in  the  toaster and  shut 
off the faucet at the same instant.  I’ll start frying when the faucet drips for the D­th time 
and stop  frying when  the  toaster pops  for  the P ­th  time.  What values of D  and P  make 
this plan work? 

D = 

P  = 

Reminder: Calculators are not allowed. 
Solution. The Pulverizer gives 5 · 87 − 8 · 54 = 3. Multiplying by 47 gives: 
235 · 87 − 376 · 54 = 141 
⇒ 
235 · 87 = 141 + 376 · 54

Thus, I’ll start frying after at drip D = 376 and stop 141 seconds later at pop P  = 87.

matched with a boy she likes. 

If  every  vertex  in  a  graph  has  degree  3,  then  the  graph  is  4­

elimination tournament. 

•  The teams are called A, B , C , . . . , P . 

•  The tournament consists of a sequence of rounds. 

–  In each round, the teams are paired up and play matches. 
–  The losers are eliminated, and the winners advance to the next round. 
–  The tournament ends when there is only one team left.

Solution.  Suppose  that  we  draw  the  tournament  so  that  the  winning  team  in  each 
game  is  listed  above  the  losing  team.  Then  the  ordering  of  teams  on  the  left  completely 
determines  all matches  and winners.  Therefore,  there  are  16!  single­elimination  tourna­
ments. 
Another  approach  is  to  use  a  result  from  earlier  in  the  course:  the  number  of  ways 
to pair up 2n people  is (2n)!/n! 2n .  In a single­elimination  tournament, we must pair up 
16  teams, determine who wins  the 8 matches between  them,  then pair up  the 8 winning 
teams, detrmine who wins the 4 matches, and so forth. The number of ways in which this 
can be done is: 
8! 
2! 
4! 
1! 21  · 
· 
2! 22  ·
· 
4! 24  ·
· 
8! 28  ·

A ﬁnal alternative is to use the General Product Rule. The champions can be chosen in 
16 ways,  the other ﬁnalists  in 15 ways,  the semi­ﬁnalist  that played  the champions  in 14 
ways,  the  other  semi­ﬁnalist  in  13 ways,  and  so  forth.  In  all,  this  gives  16!  tournaments 
again.

Problem 5.  [10 points] There are 3 children of different ages. What is the probability that 
at least two are boys, given that at least one of the two youngest children is a boy? 
Assume that each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl and that their genders are 
mutually  independent.  A  correct  answer  alone  is  sufﬁcient.  However,  to  be  eligible  for 
partial credit, you must include a clearly­labeled tree diagram. 
Solution.  Let M  be  the  event  that  there  are  at  least  two  boys,  and  let Y  be  the  event 
that at least one of the two youngest children is a boy.  In the tree diagram below, all edge 
probabilities are 1/2.

Problem 6.  [15 points] On the morning of day 1, I put a gray document on my desk. This 
creates a stack of height 1: 

On  each  subsequent morning,  I  insert  a white  document  into  the  stack  at  a  position  se­
lected uniformly at random. For example, the stack might look like this on the evening of 
day 5: 



Then, on the following morning, I would insert a white document at one of the six posi­
tions indicated above with equal probability. 
Let the random variable Bn  be the number of white documents below the gray docu­
ment on day n. 

(a)  Express Pr (Bn+1  = 0) in terms of Pr (Bn  = 0). 

Pr (Bn+1  = 0) =

(d)	 Use  induction  to  prove  that  Bn  is  uniformly  distributed  on  {0, 1, 2, . . . , n − 1}. 
You may assume your answers to the preceding problem parts without justiﬁcation. 
Solution.  We use  induction.  Let P (n) be  the proposition  that Bn  is uniformly dis­
tributed on the set {0, 1, 2, . . . , n − 1}. 
Base case. The random variable B1  is always equal to 0, so it is uniformly distributed 
on {0}. 
Inductive step.  Assume that the random variable Bn  is uniformly distributed on the 
set {0, 1, 2, . . . , n − 1} and consider the random variable Bn+1 . There are three cases: 
n 
Pr (Bn  = 0)

In  each  case,  the  ﬁrst  equation  comes  from  the  preceding  problem  parts.  We  use 
the  induction  hypotheses  on  the  starred  lines.  The  remaining  steps  are  simplﬁca­
tions. This shows that Bn+1  is uniformly distributed, and the claim follows from the 
principle of induction.

order: 

Bubba, Stu, Stu, Bubba, Bubba, Stu, Stu, Bubba, Bubba, Stu, Stu, etc.

•  Stu hits the sign with probability 1/4. 

What  is  the probability  that Bubba hits  the sign before Stu?  Assume  that hits occur mu­
