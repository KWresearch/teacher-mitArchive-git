***** Texts *****
The readings in the table below are separated into textbook sections and video
demonstrations. The textbook sections come from the Zahn and Woodson/Melcher
textbooks. The video demonstrations accompany the Haus/Melcher textbook. The
Haus/Melcher textbook is used as a supplement for the first half of the course
in addition to the textbook sections listed below. All three textbooks can be
found here.
