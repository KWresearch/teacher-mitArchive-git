Problem  7.1 

The  electric  ﬁeld  intensity  between  the  plates  is 

E  = v/a 

Hence,  the  surface  charge  adjacent  to  the  free  space  region  on  the  upper  plate  is 

σf  = ε0 v/a 

while  that  next  to  the  nonlinear  dielectric  slab  is

We  ignore  fringing ﬁelds.  Then  the  electric ﬁeld  is  completely between  the  center plate  and  the  outer plates, 
where  it has  the value E  = v/b.  The constraints on  the electrical  terminals  further  require  that v = V0 − Ax.

The  surface  charge  on  the  outer  plates  is  ε0

Finally,  we  use  the  electrical  circuit  conditions  to  write 
f e  = −

The ma jor point to be made in this situation is this.  One might substitute the voltage, as it depends on x, into 
(2)  before  taking  the  derivative.  This  clearly  gives  an  answer  not  in  agreement  with  (4).  We  have  assumed 
in writing  (3)  that  the  variables  (v , x)  remain  thermodynamically  independent  until  after  the  force  has  been 
found.  Of  course,  in  the  actual  situation,  external  constraints  relate  these  variables,  but  these  constraints 
can  only  be  introduced  with  care  in  the  energy  functions.  To  be  safe  they  should  not  be  introduced  until 
after  the  force  has  been  found.

Problem  7.3 

A 

The magnetic  ﬁeld  intensity  in  the  gap  must  ﬁrst  be  related  to  the  excitation  current.  From  Ampere’s  law 

N i = dHd  + xHx 

(5) 

where the ﬁelds Hd  and Hx  are directed counterclockwise around the magnetic circuit when they are positive. 
These  ﬁelds  are  further  related  because  the  magnetic  ﬂux  into  the  movable  member  must  equal  that  out  of 
it 

µ0wbHd  = µ0waHx

There are  four equations of motion  in the dependent variables  i1 , i2 , x1  and x2 ;  two of these are the electrical

so  that  the  torque  of  electrical  origin  is

T e  = M (sin 2θ(i2

For  the  two  phase  currents,  as  given,

i1 i2  = I 2 1

so  that  the  torque  T e  becomes 
T e  = M I 2 (− sin 2θ cos 2ωs t + sin 2ωs t cos 2θ) 

sin 2ωs t 

or 

T e  = M I 2  sin(2ωs t − 2θ) 
Substitution  of  θ = ωm t + γ  obtains 
T e  = −M I 2  sin(2(ωm  − ωs )t + 2γ ) 
and  for  this  torque  to  be  constant,  we must  have  the  frequency  condition 

ωm  = ωs 

under  which  condition,  the  torque  can  be  written  as 
T e  = −M I 2  sin 2γ

To  determine  the  possible  equilibrium  angles  δ0 ,  the  perturbations  and  time  derivatives  are  set  to  zero  in 
the mechanical  equations  of  motion. 

T0  = M I 2  sin 2γ0 

(13) 

Here,  we  have  written  the  time  dependence  in  a  form  that  is  convenient  if  cos 2γ0  > 0,  as  it  is  at  the  points 
marked  (s)  in  Fig.  2.  Hence,  these  points  are  stable.  At  the  points  marked  (u),  the  argument  of  the  sin 
function  and  the  denominator  are  imaginary,  and  the  response  takes  the  form  of  a  sinh  function.  Hence,  the 
equilibrium  points  indicated  by  (u)  are  unstable. 
Graphical  solutions  of  this  expression  are  shown  in  Fig.  2.  For  there  to  be  equilibrium  values  of  γ  the 
currents  must  be  large  enough  that  the  torque  can  be  maintained  with  the  rotor  in  synchronism  with  the 
rotating  ﬁeld  (M I 2  > T0 ).  Returning  to  the  perturbation  part  of  the  equation  of motion  with  ωm  = ωs ,
