As  seen  in part  (b),  positive  and negative  charge  carriers  give  opposite polarity  voltages,  so  answer  is “yes.”

We assumed Hz  = Hr  = 0.  This follows from the symmetry of the problem.  Hr  = 0 because  S  µ0H� d�a = 
0.  In  particular  choose  S  as  shown  in  Figure  4a. 

Figure  4:  A  diagram  of  the  current  carrying  wire  of  radius  b  with  the  choice  for  S  as  well  as  a  diagram  of 
the  wire  with  the  choice  of  contour  C  (Image  by MIT  OpenCourseWare). 

Hz  is  more  diﬃcult  to  see.  It  is  discussed  in  Haus  &  Melcher.  The  basic  idea  is  to  use  the  contour,  C 
∞, which  is not possible 
(depicted  in Figure 4b),  to  show  that  if Hz  = 0  it would have  to be nonzero  even at 
without  sources  at ∞.
