Problem 1.1 – Coulomb-Lorentz Force Law 
 

i)  An electroscope measures charge by the angular deflection of two identical 
conducting balls suspended by an essentially weightless insulating string of length 
l.  Each ball has mass M in the gravity field g and when charged can be 
considered a point charge. 

s 

 
A total charge Q is deposited on the two identical balls of the electroscope when 
they are touching.  The balls then repel each other and the string is at an angle θ 
from the normal which obeys a relation of the form 
 

constant

a)  What is the constant? 
 
ii) A point charge –Q1 of mass m travels in a circular orbit of radius R about a stationary  
 
    charge of opposite sign Q2. 
 
 
 

a)  What is the equilibrium angular speed of the charge –Q1? 
b)  This problem describes Bohr’s one electron model of the atom 
if the charge –Q1 is that of an electron and Q2=Ze is a nuclear 
charge, where Z is the number of protons.  According to the 
postulates of quantum mechanics the angular momentum L of the

iv)  The charge to mass ratio of an electron e/m was first measured by Sir J. J. Thomson 
in 1897 by the cathode-ray tube device shown.  Electrons emitted by the cathode 
pass through a slit in the anode into a region with crossed electric and magnetic 
fields, both being perpendicular to the electrons velocity.  The end screen of the 
tube is coated with a fluorescent material that produces a bright spot where the 
electron beam impacts.

The mass spectrograph uses the circular motion to determine the masses of 
ions and to measure the relative proportions of isotopes. Charges enter 
between parallel plate electrodes with a y directed velocity distribution. 
Gravitational effects are negligible compared to the electric/magnetic forces 
since the ions have so little mass.

To pick out those charges with a particular magnitude of velocity, perpendicular 
electric and magnetic fields are imposed so that the net force on a charge is

c)  Note that the charge circular path diameter d depends on the ion mass, and so can 
be used to detect different isotopes that have the same number of protons but a 
different number of neutrons. The isotopes thus have the same charge but 
different masses. Typically V

Problem 2.2 

The curl and divergence operations have a simple relationship that will be used 
throughout the subject. 

(a)  One might be tempted to apply the divergence theorem to the surface integral in 
Stokes’ theorem. However, the divergence theorem requires a closed surface 
while Stokes’ theorem is true in general for an open surface. Stokes’ theorem for 
a closed surface requires the contour to shrink to zero giving a zero result for the 
line integral. Use the divergence theorem applied to the closed surface with vector
