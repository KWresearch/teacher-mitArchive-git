Problem 3.1
An electric dipole consists of two opposite polarity charges, q at z d / 2 .

(a) Start with the electric potential of a point charge, and determine (r,) for the electric
dipole.
(b) Define the dipole moment as p=qdand show that in the limit where d  0 (while p
remains finite), the electric potential is
p cos
( r,) 
4 r 2
o
(c) What is the electric field for the dipole of part (b) with d  0 with p remaining finite?
(d) The electric field lines are lines that are tangent to the electric field:
dr
E r
rd E
Using the result of (c), integrate this equation to find the field line that passes through the
radial point r0 when /2. This analytical equation can be used to precisely plot the
electric field lines.
Hint: cotdln(sin) +constant
(e) Use your favorite computer plotting routine to plot on the same plot the equipotential and
electric field lines for 4o / p 100 volt -1-m-2. Draw electric field lines for r0=0.25, 0.5,
1 and 2 meters and draw equipotential lines for 0, .0025, .01, .04, .16 and
.64 volts.

Problem 3.2

When a bird perches on a dc high-voltage power line and then flies away, it does so carrying a
net charge.

(a) Why?
(b) For the purpose of measuring this net charge Q carried by the bird, we have the apparatus
pictured below. Flush with the ground, a strip electrode having width w and length l is
mounted so that it is insulated from ground. The resistance, R , connecting the electrode
to ground is small enough that the potential of the electrode (like that of the surrounding
ground) can be approximated as zero. The bird flies in the x direction at a height h above
the ground with a velocity U . Thus, its position is taken as y=h and x=Ut. At time t,
what is the effective charge distribution that will allow easy calculation of the electric
scalar potential?
(c) The bird flies at an altitude h sufficiently large to m ake it appear as a point charge. What
is the potential distribution as a function of time and position (x, y, z)?
(d) Determine the surface charge density s ( x, y 0, z, t ) on the ground plane at y=0 as a
function of time.
(e) At time t, what is the net charge, q, on the electrode? (Assume that the width w is small
compared to h so that in an integration over the electrode surface, the integration in the z
direction is simply a multiplication by w.)
Hint: Let xx Ut

Hint:

a 2 [ a 2 x 2 ]1 / 2
[a 2 x 2 ]3 / 2
(f) The current through the resistor is dq/dt . Find an expression for the voltage, v, that would
be measured across the resistance, R.

Problem 3.4

A constant current K o i flows on the surface of a sphere of radius R .

(a) What is the magnetic field intensity at the center o f the sphere?

of inner radius R1 and outer radius R2 carrying a uniformly distributed vo lume current
JJ o i.

A line current I of infinite extent in the z -direction is at a distance d above a perfectly conducting 
plane.

potential for y>0. 
(b)  What is the magnetic field for y>0? 
(c)	 What is the surface current distribution that flows on the y=0 surface? 
(d)  What is the force per unit length on the line current at y=d ?
