(a) Two line currents of infinite extent in the z direction are a distance d apart along the y-
axis. The current I1 is located at y=d/2 and the current I2 is located at y=-d/2 . Find the
magnetic field (magnitude and direction) at any point in the y=0 plane when the currents
are:

i)
I1 =I, I2=0
ii) both equal, I1=I2=I
iii) of opposite direction but equal magnitude, I1=-I2=I. This configuration is called a
current line dipole with moment mx=Id.

The vector distance between a source point at Q and a field point at P is:

(c) A circular hoop of line charge 0 coulombs/meter with radius a is centered about the origin
in the z=0 plane. Find the electric scalar potential along the z-axis for z<0 and z0 using
Eq. (1) with ( r)dV oad. Then find the electric field magnitude and direction using
symmetry and E . Verify that using Eq. (5) gives the same electric field. What do
the electric scalar potential and electric field approach as z   and how do these results
relate to the potential and electric field of a point charge?

(d) Use the results of (c) to find the electric scalar potential and electric field along the z axis
for a uniformly surface charged circular disk of radius a with uniform surface charge
density0 coulombs/m2. Consider z>0 and z<0.

(e) What do the electric scalar potential and electric field approach as z   and how do these
results relate to the potential and electric field of a point charge?

(f) What do the potential and electric field approach as the disk gets very large so that a  .

Problem 2.3

The curl and divergence operations have a simple relationship that will be used throughout the
subject.

(a) One might be tempted to apply the divergence theorem to the surface integral in Stokes’
theorem. However, the divergence theorem requires a closed surface while Stokes’
theorem is true in general for an open surface. Stokes’ theorem for a closed surface
requires the contour to shrink to zero giving a zero result for the line integral. Use the
divergence theorem applied to the closed surface with vector Ato prove that
(A) 0 .
(b) Verify (a) by direct computation in Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates.
