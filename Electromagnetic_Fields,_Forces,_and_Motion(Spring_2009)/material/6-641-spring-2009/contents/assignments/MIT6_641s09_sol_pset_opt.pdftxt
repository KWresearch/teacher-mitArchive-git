We assumed Hz  = Hr  = 0.  This follows from the symmetry of the problem.  Hr  = 0 because  S  µ0H� d�a =

0.  In  particular  choose  S  as  shown  in  Figure  12a.

contour  C  (Image  by MIT  OpenCourseWare). 

Hz  is  more  diﬃcult  to  see.  It  is  discussed  in  Haus  &  Melcher,  Chapter  1.  The  basic  idea  is  to  use  the 
contour,  C  (depicted  in  Figure  12b),  to  show  that  if  Hz  = 0  it  would  have  to  be  nonzero  even  at 
∞,  which 
is  not  possible  without  sources  at ∞.

–	 Accumulation  of  charge  on  balloon  surfaces 
–	 Balloons  repel  each  other  because  they  have  been  charged  to  same  polarity 
–	 Charges  on  balloons  induce  image  charges  of  opposite  polarity  on  conducting  surfaces 
∗	 Balloons  are  then  attracted  to  these  surfaces 
•	 If  we  insert  balloons  in  a  Faraday  cage 
–	 We  can  measure  the  charges  on  the  balloons 
–	 It makes  no  diﬀerence  to  the measurement  if  balloons make  contact  with  the  inner  surface 
–	 If balloon  is broken  in the Faraday cage the charge  is not removed when the broken balloon pieces 
are  removed

•	 Typical  currents  of  20-30  Amps 
•	 As  current  is  raised,  Lorentz  force  can  overcome  the  coils  weight  and  the  pancake  coil  rises 
•	 For  ground  plate  thickness  ∼  skin  depth,  the  coil  rises 
•	 For  ground  plate  thickness  less  than  skin  depth,  the  coil  lifts  up  at  higher  current 
•	 For  ground  plate  thickness  much  less  than  skin  depth,  the  coil  does  not  lift  up,  because  most  of  the 
magnetic  ﬁeld  penetrates  through  the  ground  plane.

The charge density along the hoop will have a sinusoidal variation as a function of φ as shown in Figure 16 
with  zero  net  charge  on  the  hoop. 
Due  to  odd  symmetry  of  the  charge  distribution  the  z  component  of  the E  ﬁeld will  cancel  out  as  shown 
in  Figure  15. 

E (r) = 

i.e.,  dEz |φ  = −dEz |φ+π 
Similarly  due  to  symmetry  with  respect  to  the  yz  plane,  the  x  component  of  the  E  ﬁeld  also  cancels  as 
shown  in  Figure  17. 
Thus  the  resulting  E  ﬁeld  is  in  −y  direction  only!

Problem  2.4 

Demo  4.7.1:  Charge  Induced  in  Ground  Plane  by  Overhead  Conductor 

•	 This  problem  is  analogous  to  high  voltage  power  line  over  earth  problem. 
•	 We  can  use  image  charge  assumption  to  determine  the  induced  charge  on  ground  plane. 
•	 We  make  use  of  a  plane  probe,  insulated  from  the  ground  plane,  to  measure  the  charge  induced  on  it 
by  the  cylindrical  conductor. 
•	 The  surface  charge  density  distribution  is  proportional  to  the  voltage  applied  to  the  cylinder. 
•	 Because the probe voltage is time derivative of the applied voltage, the probe signal is 90◦  out-of-phase. 
•	 As  the  probe  is moved  out  from  below  the  conductor  cylinder,  charge  induced  on  its  surface  decreases. 
•	 Electric  ﬁeld  at  low  frequencies  do  not  penetrate  conducting  body. 
Demo  10.2.1:  Edgerton’s  Boomer 

•	 Illustrates  induction  of  a  current  in  a  conductor,  sub jected  to  a  time  varying magnetic  ﬁeld. 
•	 Illustrates  the  interplay  of  laws  of  Faraday,  Ampere,  and  Ohm. 
•	 MQS  conditions  apply. 
•	 4kV  capacitor  voltage. 
•	 Use  of  a  coil  probe  to  determine  voltage  induced  by  time  varying  magnetic  ﬁeld. 
•	 Magnetic  ﬁeld  produced  by  the  coil  is  non-uniform,  similar  to  that  of  a  dipole. 
•	 Prediction  of  an  arc  due  to  high  electric  ﬁeld  intensity  between  almost  touching  wires. 
•	 Can  be  used  to  chape materials. 
•	 Or  shoot  up metal  plates. 

Problem  3.1 

Demo  8.4.1:  Surface  used  to  deﬁne  ﬂux  linkage 

•	 Copper  wires  were  wound  on  a  circular  wooden  rod,  and  coil  inductances  are measured. 
•	 If  number  of  turns  is  doubled,  the measured  inductance  value  is  quadrupled 
•	 When  number  of  coils  is  doubled  as  well  as  the  length,  the  inductance  value  is  doubled 
Results  agree  well  with  the  theoretical  equation:  L =  µ0 AN 2 
•

Demo  8.2.1:  Field  of  circular  cylindrical  solenoid 

•	 Magnetic  ﬁeld  of  a  large  cylindrical  solenoid  is  measured  using  magnetometer  probe  and  transverse 
probe 
•	 Field  insude  is  uniform  and  in  the  axial  direction,  the  ﬁeld  outside  the  solenoid  is  close  to  0.

•	 Circular  cylindrical  solenoid  is  analogous  to  plane  parallel  capacitors  for  having  uniform  B-ﬁeld  inside 
and  zero  B-ﬁeld  outside 
•	 A  transverse  probe  (which  measures  B-ﬁeld  intensity  transverse  to  its  surface)  is  used  to  determine 
that  the  B-ﬁeld  inside  is  axial. 
•	 Through a  slit  cut on  the  cylindrical  solenoid,  the  transverse probe  is used  to observe  the discontinuity 
of  the magnetic  ﬁeld  intensity  between  inside  and  outside. 

Demo  8.2.2:  Field  of  square  pair  of  coils 

•	 2  square  coils  45cm  apart,  each  has  50  turns  and  size  of  45cm  length. 
•	 Axial magnetometer  probe  is  used  to measure  the  intensity  of  axial magnetic  ﬁeld 
•	 Theoretical  curve  is  well matched  (see  Figure  24)

Equipotential  surfaces  due  to  two  line  charges  of  magnitude  λ  and  −λ  are  cylinders.  See  Figure  2.24  in 
Zahn’s  book. 

Figure  34:  A  pair  of  opposite  polarity  line  charges  have  circular  cylindrical  equipotential  surfaces  (Image  by 
MIT  OpenCourseWare). 

2 
Thus,  if an image charge −λ is placed inside the cylinder at  R
(see Zahn p.  98) distance from the center, 
D 
the  condition  for  an  equipotential  surface  at  the  cylinder  will  be  satisﬁed. 

Figure 35:  A diagram showing an image line charge −λ a distance R2/D away from the center of the cylinder 
and  another  line  charge  λ  a  distance D  away  from  the  center.  (Image  by MIT  OpenCourseWare). 

In  order  to  satisify  the  condition  that  the  surface  of  the  cylinder  holds  a  charge  per  unit  length  λc ,  and 
maintaining  that  the  surface  is  equipotential,  another  image  charge  must  be  placed  at  the  center  of  the 
cylinder.  This  image  charge  has  value  λ + λc  to  keep  the  total  cylinder  charge  at  λc . 

Problem  reduces  to  (see  ﬁgure  36):

Force  on  cylinder  is  due  to  the  force  on  the  two  image  line  charges  −λ  and  λ + λc

•  Hall  eﬀect  proble measures  B-ﬁeld  intensity  perpendicular  to  its  ﬂat  surface. 
•  Magnetic  ﬁeld  due  to  a  wire  is  non-zero  only  in  φ  direction.

•	 Application of voltage v  to  the electrodes results  in the spheres acquiring negative and positive charges 
on  their  poles. 
•	 Insertion  of  dielectric  array  between  the  plane  parallel  conductors  increases  the  capacitance. 
9.4.1 Measurement  of  B-H  Characteristic 
•	 Magnetizable material 
•	 Polycrystalline and ferromagnetic materials at domain level have randomly oriented magnetic moments 
that  tend  to  cancel  in  the  absence  of  applied  ﬁeld. 
•	 Those  domains  align  with  the  applied magnetic  ﬁeld. 
•	 However  phase  delay  develops  between magnetization  and  applied  ﬁeld  resulting  in  power  dissipation.
