MidTerm Exam – Tuesday, March 17, 2009, 2-4PM, Room 24-307.  The 6.641 Formula Sheets 
(attached) will be supplied.  You are also allowed to bring one 8 ½” x 11” sheet of notes (both sides) 
that you prepare.  The exam covers all material up to and including Problem Set #5 material. 
Problem 4.1 

 
(a) A point charge q above a flat dielectric boundary requires different sets of image charges to 
solve for the fields in each region.  (b) The field in region I is due to the original charge and the 
image charge q' while the field in region II is due only to image charge q". 
A point charge q is within a region of permittivity ε1 and is a distance d above a planar 
boundary separating region I from region II, which has a permittivity ε2. There is no unpaired 
(cid:71)
(free) surface charge on the interface at y=0. The tangential component of  E
 and the normal 
component of  D  must be continuous across the interface. 
Let us try to use the method of images by placing an image charge q′ at y=-d so that the 
solution in region I is due to this image charge plus the original point charge q. The solution 
for the field in region II will be due to an image charge q" at y=d, the position of the original 
point charge. Note that the appropriate image charge is always outside the region where the 
solution is desired. At this point we do not know if it is possible to satisfy the boundary 
conditions with these image charges, but we will try to find values of q′ and q" to do so. 
a)  What are the potential and electric field distributions in region I (y>0) and region II 
(y<0) in terms of q, q′, and q"? 
(cid:71)
b)  What equations relate q, q′, and q" to satisfy continuity of tangential  E
D ? Solve for q′ and q" in terms of q, ε1 and ε2. 
c)  What is the force on the point charge q?

A line current I of infinite extent in the z direction is at a distance d above an infinitely 
permeable material as shown. 

a)  What is the boundary condition on the magnetic field at y=0?

magnetic vector potential for y>0. Hint: The solution is very similar to that of 
Homework Problem 3.5. 
c)  What is the magnetic field for y>0? 
d)  Derive the equation of the magnetic field lines for y>0.
