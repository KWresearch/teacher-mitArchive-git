MidTerm Exam – Tuesday, March 17, 2009, 2-4PM. The 6.641 Formula Sheets (attached)
will be supplied. You are also allowed to bring one 8 ½” x 11” sheet of notes (both sides) t hat you
prepare. The exam covers all material up to and including Problem Set #5 material.
Problem 5.1
A point charge q with mass m and velocity v moves in a vacuum through a magnetic field H .
Newton’s law for this charge is:
dv

m q v
o H

A uniform magnetic field in the z direction is imposed
HH i

Solve Newton’s law for the three velocity components v x , v y , and v z for initial conditions

Note that the velocity magnitude is constant so that a circular motion results in the x-y plane.
What is the radius of the circle?

a)

The mass spectrograph uses the circular motion to determine the masses of ions and to measure
the relative proportions of isotopes. Charges enter between parallel plate electrodes with a y
directed velocity distribution. Gravitational effects are negligible compared to the
electric/magnetic forces since the ions have so little mass.

PS#5, p.1

i. To pick out those charges with a particular magnitude of velocity, perpendicular electric
and magnetic fields are imposed so that the net force on a charge is
fq( Evo H)

For charges to pass through the narrow slit at the end of the channel, they must not be
deflected by the fields which require this force to be zero. For a selected velocity v y v o ,
what is the required applied electric field and thus the necessary voltage V for a given
magnetic field H H o i
z so that an ion will make it through this slit undeflected? The
plate electrodes have a spacing, s , as shown in the figure.

ii. Note that the charge circular path diameter d depends on the ion mass, and so can be used
to detect different isotopes that have the same number of protons but a different number
of neutrons. The isotopes thus have the same charge but different masses. Typically V=-
100 volts across a s=1 cm gap with a magnetic field of o H=1 tesla. The mass of a
proton and neutron are each about m=1.67 x 10 27 kg. Consider the three isotopes of
magnesium 12 Mg 24 , 12Mg 25 , and 12Mg 26 , each deficient of one electron. At what
positions d will each isotope hit the photographic plate?

b)

A magnetron is essentially a parallel plate capacitor stressed
by constant voltage Vo where electrons of charge -e are
emitted at x=0, y=0 with zero initial velocity. A transverse
magnetic field H o i
z is app lied. Neglect the electric and
magnetic fields due to the electrons in comparison to the
applied field.

i. What is the velocity and displacement of an
electron, injected with zero initial velocity at t=0?
ii. What value of magnetic field will just prevent the
electrons from reaching the other electrode? This
is the cut-off magnetic field.
