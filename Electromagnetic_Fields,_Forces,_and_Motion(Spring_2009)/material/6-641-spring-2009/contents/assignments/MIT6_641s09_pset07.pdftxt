Problem 7.2 (W&M Prob. 3.16) 
3.16.  A  plane  electrode is  free to move  into  the  region  between  plane-parallel electrodes, 
as  shown  in  Fig.  3P.16.The outer electrodes are at  the  same potential, whereas the  inner 
electrode is at  a potential determined by  the constant voltage source  V, in  series with  the 
output  of an amplifier driven by  a signal proportional  to  the displacement of  the movable 
electrode  itself.  Hence  the  voltage  of  the  inner  electrode  relative  to  that  of  the  outer 
electrodes is v  = - V, + Ax,  where A  is a given feedback gain. Find  the force of  electrical 
originp(x), (Note that this force is only a function of  position, since the voltage is a known 
function of  2.)

problem 7 .3(W&M h o b .  3-4) 

3.4.  A magnetic circuit, including a movable plunger,  is shown in Fig.  3P.4. The circuit is 
excited  by an  N-turn  coil  and  consists of  a  perfectly  permeable yoke and  plunger  with a 
variable air  gap x ( t )   and  a fixed  nonmagnetic gap  d.  The system, with  the  cross section 
shown, has a width w into the paper. The following parts lead to a mathematical formulation 
of  the equations of  motion  for  the mass M,  given  the excitation I ( t ) .  
(a)  Find the terminal relation for the f lux  A(i, z)linked by the electrical terminal pair. 
Ignore fringing in the nonmagnetic gaps. Note that  the coil links the flux through 
the magnetic material N times. 
(b) Find  the  energy  W,(A,  x)  stored  in  the electromechanical coupling.  This should 
be done by making use of  part  (a). 
(c) 	 Use the  energy  function  W,(R,  x)  t o   compute  the  force of  electrical  origin f 
acting on the plunger. 
(d) 	 Write  an  electrical  (circuit)  equation  of  motion  involving  R  and  x  as the  only 
dependent variables and I ( t )  as a driving function. 
(c) 	  Write the mechanical equation of motion for  the mass.This differential equation 
should have  A  and x  as the only  dependent variables, hence taken with  the result 
of  (d)  should  constitute  a  mathematical  formulation appropriate  for  analyzing 
the system dynamics.

along the periphery of  the stator, rather than as shown. The rotor  is made of magnetically 
soft iron which has no residual permanent magnetism.  The electrical terminal relations are 
given  by 
Al  = (Lo+ M cos 2@il + M sin 28 i,, 
& = M sin 20 1,  + (Lo- M cos 28)i,. 
(a) 	 Determine the torque of  electrical origin T e ( i l ,is, 0 ) .  
(b) 	 Assume  that  the  machine  is  excited  by  sources  such  that  i, = I cos  us$, 
i,  = I s i n  w,r,  and  the  rotor  has  the  constant  angular  velocity  om such  that 
0  = w,t  + Y .   Evaluate  @e  ~.ppn@eous,torque  Td.UnI!&rwhat  conditions 
is  it  constant? 

(c) 	  The rotor is subjected to a mechanical torque (acting on it in  the  +&dimtion): 
T = To+ T t ( t ) , where  Tois  a  constant.  The  time-varying  part  of  the  torque 
perturbs  the  steady  rotation  of  (b)  so that  8 = o,r  + y o  + y t ( t ) .  Assume  that 
the rotor has a moment of inertia J but that there is no damping. Find the possible 
equilibrium angles y o  between the rotor and the stator field. Then write a differen- 
tial  equation for / ( t ) ,  with  ~ ' ( t )as a driving function. 
Id)  Consider small perturbations of  the rotation y ' ( t ) ,  so that the equation of motion 
found in  (c)  can be h e a r i d .  Find the response to an impulse of  torque T ' ( t )= 
I&*(?), assuming that before the impulse in torque the rotation velocity is constant. 
(e) 	  Which  of  the equilibrium phase angles yo  found in  (c) is stabIe?
