Problem 1.1 
 
In Demonstration 1.4.1 the magnetic field strength is measured by a Hall effect probe. This 
probe works by the principle that when charges flow perpendicular to a magnetic field, the 
transverse displacement due to the Lorentz force can give rise to an electric field. 

Due:  

 
Figure  5-6    A  magnetic  field  perpendicular  to  a  current  flow  deflects  the 
charges  transversely  giving  rise  to  an  electric  field  and  the  Hall  voltage.  
The polarity of the voltage is the same as the sign of the charge carriers.

 is in the positive y direction, while for 
semiconductor, the charge velocity 
negative charges as typically occur in metals or in n-type semiconductors, the charge 
velocity vy is negative. In the steady state, the charge velocity vy does not vary with 
time so the net force on the charges must be zero. What is the electric field 
(magnitude and direction) in terms of vy and Bo?

(c)  Can this measurement determine the polarity of the charge carriers assuming that the 
current i is positively y-directed and B0 is positively z-directed? 

 
Problem 1.2 
 
In a spherically symmetric configuration, the region r < b has the non-uniform charge 
density  ρb r/b  and is surrounded by a region b < r < a having the uniform charge density 
aρ .  
At r = b there is no surface charge density, while at r = a there is perfectly conducting sheet 
with surface charge density that assures E = 0 for r > a. 
(a)  What is the total charge in the regions 0< r< b and b < r < a? 
(b) Determine E in the two regions r < b and b < r < a. 
(c)  What is the surface charge density at r = a? 
(d) What is the total charge in the system for 0< r≤ a. 

 
Problem 1.3 
 
In polar coordinates, a non-uniform current density 
J r b zi  exists over the cross-section of a

wire having a radius b.  The total current in the wire is returned in the -z direction as a 
uniform surface current at the radius r = a where a> b. 
(a)  What is the surface current density at r = a? 
(b)  Find the magnetic field in the regions 0 < r < b, b < r < a, and r > a.
