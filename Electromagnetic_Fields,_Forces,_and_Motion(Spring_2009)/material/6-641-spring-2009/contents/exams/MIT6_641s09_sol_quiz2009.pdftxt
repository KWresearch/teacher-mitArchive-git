Problem  1


Figure  1:  A  diagram  of  a  perfectly  conducting  hollow  sphere  ﬁlled with  a  perfectly  insulating  dielectric with 
a  uniform  distribution  of  volume  charge  (Image  by MIT  OpenCourseWare). 

A  perfectly  conducting  hollow  sphere  of  radius  R  is  ﬁlled  with  a  perfectly  insulating  dielectric  (σ  =  0) 
with  a  uniform  distribution  of  volume  charge: 

ρ = ρ0 

0 < r < R 

within  a  medium  with  permittivity  �.  The  sphere  is  grounded  at  r = R  so  that  the  scalar  electric  potential 
at  r = R  is  zero,  Φ(r = R) = 0.  There  is  no  point  charge  at  r = 0  so  that  Er (r = 0) must  be  ﬁnite.

Hint  2:  riφ  = r(− sin φix  + cos φiy ) = (−y ix  + xiy )  where  r =  x2  + y2 
Solution:  Step  1:  Put  current  density  Jo iz  in  hole  with  Jo iz  outside  hole.  Then  magnetic  ﬁeld  is  the  same 
as  part  (a)  with  J  = 0  outside 
Step  2:  Put  current  density  −Jo iz  in  hole  with  J  = 0  outside  hole.  Thus  net  current  in  hole  is  zero  and  net 
current  outside  hole  is  Jo iz .

Problem  4 

A  resistor  is  formed  in  the  shape of a circular cylindrical half-shell of  inner  radius b and outer  radius a and  is 
composed of two materials with ohmic conductivites and permittivities (σ1 , �1 ) for 0 < φ <  π 
2  and (σ2 , �2 ) for 
π  < φ < π .  A  DC  voltage  V0  is  applied  to  the  electrode  at  φ = 0  while  the  electrode  at  φ = π  is  grounded. 
2 
The  EQS  scalar  potential  is  thus  imposed  as  Φ(φ  =  0)  =  V0 , Φ(φ  =  π)  =  0.  The  cylindrical  system  has  a 
depth  d.
