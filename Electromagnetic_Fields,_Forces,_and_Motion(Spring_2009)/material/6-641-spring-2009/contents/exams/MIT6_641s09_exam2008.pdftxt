Mass per unit area  mσ  , 
Equilibrium tension  S 

An electrically conducting membrane with a mass per unit area σm   is stretched horizontally with 
equilibrium tension  S  between two rigid supports at  x = 0  and  x = (cid:65) .  With no other forces 
acting on the membrane, the downwards gravitational force makes the membrane sag in the 
middle.  We can remove the sag without physical contact with the membrane by placing an 
electrode above the membrane and applying a voltage V0  between the membrane and fixed plate 
electrode.  The electrode is attached to a dielectric with permittivity ε and thickness  a and the 
gap distance to the membrane is  b

of the membrane that only depends on coordinate  x  and time  t .  Neglect fringing field effects 
and assume the “long-wave limit” so that  E1  and  E2  can be assumed to only be  y directed.
