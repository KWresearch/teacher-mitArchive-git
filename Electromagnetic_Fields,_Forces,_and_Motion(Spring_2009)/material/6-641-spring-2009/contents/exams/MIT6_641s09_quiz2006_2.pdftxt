The figure below shows a diagrammatic cross section of a two-phase, salient-pole synchronous 
machine.  The windings in an actual machine are distributed in many slots

iron which has no residual permanent magnetism.  The electrical terminal relations are given by

the stator field and indicate which are stable and unstable.  Then write a differential equation
