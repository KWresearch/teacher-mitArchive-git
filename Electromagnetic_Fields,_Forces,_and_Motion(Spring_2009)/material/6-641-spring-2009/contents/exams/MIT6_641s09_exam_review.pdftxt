Problem  1 

6.641,  Spring  2005 

A  perfectly-conducting  channel  of  height  D  and  width  2W  is  divided  into  two  free-space  regions  by  a  very 
thin  perfectly-conducting  slide  as  shown  below.  The  ˆz -directed  magnetic  ﬁelds  in  the  left  and  right  regions 
are  Hl (t) ˆz  and  Hr (t) ˆz , respectively.  The slide has a mass  M  per unit length in the ˆz  direction, has a variable 
position  ξ (t),  and makes  a  frictionless  but  perfectly-conducting  contact  with  the  channel. 

(A)  Assume  that  at  t  = 0, Hl  =  Hl0 , Hr  =  Hr0 ,  and  ξ  =  ξ0 .  Determine  Hl (t)  and  Hr (t)  in  terms  of 
Hl0 , Hr0 , ξ0 ,  and  ξ (t). 

(B)  The very  thin slide supports a surface current  K yˆ which  separates  Hl zˆ and  Hr zˆ. This current interacts 
with  the  neighboring  magnetic  ﬁelds  to  produce  a  force  F xˆ on  the  slide  per  unit  length  in  the  ˆz  direction. 
Evaluate  F . 

(C)  Use the results of (B)  to  ﬁnd  a function  V (ξ ) so  that

σ ,  thickness  δ ,  and  width  W  travels  to  the  right  with  velocity  U .  At  x  =  0,  a  charge  source  maintains  the 
charge density  ρ0  on  the  belt.  At  x  =  l,  a  charge  collector  collects  all  the  charge  oﬀ  the  belt.  An  external 
resistance  R  is  connected  from  the  charge  collector  to  the  charge  source.  Determine  the  current  i  through 
the  resistor  when  the  generator  is  in  steady  state.

A coaxial  cylindrical  capacitor is dipped into a linearly polarizable  ﬂuid  with dielectric permittivity  �  and 
mass density  ρm .  Gravity  is  directed  downwards. 
When  voltage  V0  is  applied,  the  dielectric  ﬂuid  is  pulled  into  the  coaxial  capacitor  to  a  height  x  above 
the  ﬂuid  level  outside  the  cylinders.  If  V0  =  0,  the  ﬂuid  level  within  the  cylinders  is  a  distance  s  from  the 
lower  end  of  the  cylinder.  There  is  no  free  volume  charge  in  the  system  .

A magnetic circuit has a stationary yoke with inﬁnite magnetic permeability with a voltage source  
v(t) =

system has depth  D.  Assume  that  both   air  gaps  are   suﬃciently  small  to  neglect  fringing   ﬁelds.

An  inﬁnitely  long  cylinder  with  dielectric  permittivity  �  and  ohmic  conductivity  σ  has  outer  radius  R2

Figure  

18: A surface current sheet at x  = 0 (Image by MIT OpenCourseWare.)

A  z  directed surface current sheet of inﬁnite extent in the y and z directions is located at x = 0 
and 
varies  with  coordinate  y  as  K¯ (x  = 0, y) =  i¯zK0  cos ky .  This  current  sheet  is  located  at  the  x  = 0 interface 
separating  a  material  of inﬁnite  magnetic permeability (µ  → ∞) for  x <  0  and  free  space  for  0  < x < s.  At 
x  =  s  there  is  another  material  of  inﬁnite  extent  for  x >  s  with inﬁnite  ohmic  conductivity (σ  → ∞).  There 
is  no  variation  with  the  z  coordinates  and  free  space  for  0  < x < s  is perfectly  insulating (σ  = 0).

Hx (x  =  s− ) = 0
