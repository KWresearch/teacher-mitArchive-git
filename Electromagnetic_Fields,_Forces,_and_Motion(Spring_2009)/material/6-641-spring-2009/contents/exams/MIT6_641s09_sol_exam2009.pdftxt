Problem  3 

A  reluctance  motor  is  made  by  placing  a  high  permeability  material,  which  is  free  to  rotate,  in  the  air  gap 
of  a magnetic  circuit  excited  by  a  current  i(t). 

Figure  3:  A  diagram  of  a  reluctance motor  (Image  by MIT  OpenCourseWare). 

The  inductance  of  the magnetic  circuit  varies  with  rotor  angle  θ  as 

L(θ) = L0  + L1 cos 2θ, L0  > 0, 0 < L1  < L0 

where  the  maximum  inductance  L0  + L1  occurs  when  θ  =  0 or  θ  =  π  and  the  minimum  inductance 
L0  − L1  occurs  when  θ = ± π .2
