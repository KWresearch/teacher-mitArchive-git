Rules for Class Attendance 
 
Legitimate excuses for missing class 
• 
I was injured and was taken to the hospital (and here is the note from the doctor / 
paramedic / ambulance driver) 
I was sick (and here is the note from the Dean / doctor / faith healer / local voodoo 
priest)  
I am on the verge of a nervous breakdown (and here is the note from the Dean / 
shrink / licensed mental health care professional) 
I play competitive sports and will be away that day for a match / swim meet / full-
contact mud-wrestling contest.  [Note future tense.] 
•  My dorm room flooded / burned down / fell over in an earthquake (and here is the 
notice from the newspaper / Dean / Fire Marshal / Army Corps of Engineers) 
•  A close relative was very sick / injured / dying / dead so I had to fly out of town 
(and here is the notice from my family / the Dean / the hospital / the funeral 
home) 

 
 
Non-excuses for missing class *
• 
I needed to pick my mother up at the airport 
•  My boyfriend / girlfriend / long-lost cousin arrived unexpectedly in town 
•  My boyfriend / girlfriend / alien lover broke up with me  
• 
I am taking two classes whose time slots conflict 
•  One of my cats has a urinary tract infection, and I needed to take him to the vet. 
• 
I overslept / needed to sleep / felt like sleeping / was overcome by that soporific 
feeling I sometimes get in the afternoon and didn’t feel like drinking any more 
coffee 
•  My alarm clock fell off of my shelf overnight and shattered into a dozen of plastic 
pieces, and consequently, it didn't go off.  I think my drunken roommate must 
have done it. 
• 
I had work for my other classes  
• 
I am not interested in _____ (insert topic of the week) 
• 
I actually believed those Master Card ads that say I deserve whatever I want 
•  My dog / cat / goldfish / pet mongoose died 
•  There was a rerun of Star Trek on TV 
•  The lecture conflicted with my aqua-aerobics class 
• 
I invented a time machine for my senior project and was trapped in 2071 when 
everyone else was in class, but I promise that three years from now, when I’ve 
gotten all the bugs out of the system, I’ll go back to last week and make up the 
session.
