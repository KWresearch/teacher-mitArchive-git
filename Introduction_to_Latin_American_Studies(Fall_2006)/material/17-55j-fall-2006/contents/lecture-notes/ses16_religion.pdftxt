Discuss changes in the Church and their implications for politics 
 
No single Catholic position 
•  Competing and contesting positions 
•  Blending of pre-Hispanic or African practices 
• 
Indians used to this 
o  Toltec gods in Mayas 
o  Aztec gods imposed on conquered peoples 
o  New deities accepted into pantheon 
o  Not willing to give up old gods 
o  Old deities go underground 
•  Layering of religious beliefs 
o 
Juan Diego, Virgin of Guadalupe, and mother goddess Tonanzin in 1531 
o  San Cristobal and Zinacantan, Maypole in Bluefields, Day of Dead 
o  [Questions:  Does this mean it’s any less “pure” a form of religion? 
Answer:  No, look at Christianity in Europe] 
•  Same thing with slave communities 
o  Orixás (or spirits, West African deities) become identified with saints 

 

Protestantism making inroads 
•  There were always some 
o  Miskito Indians, who had not been conquered were converted by mainline 
denominations 
o  German Moravian Missionaries 
o  But only 12.5% are now mainline denominations 
o  Rest are Mormons, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Seventh Day Adventists (7.5%) 
o  Pentacostals and evangelicos (80%) 
•  Some figures 
o  10-14% of total population 
o  Guatemala 30% 
o  Chile 21-22% 
o  Brazil 16-20% (1/2 of all Latin American protestants) 
• 
Jerry Falwell, Assemblies of God 
•  Pentacostals 
o  Direct experience of individuals with Holy Spirit 
o  Prophecies 
o  Faith healings and exorcism 
o  Speaking in tongues 
o  No mixing, problems caused by evil spirits (use West African dieties’names in 
exorcism); can’t go to Catholic mass occasionally 
o  Less discrimination based on race 
o  Higher clergy to believer ratio 
o  More popular base 
o  Why successful?  (1) religiously under-served communities, (2) money from 
abroad, (3)  immediate conversion, (4) very clear payoff with self-help and 
talk of community problems, (5) good message of self-reliance and 
individualism amidst strong community
