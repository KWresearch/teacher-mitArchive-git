Appendix: U. S. Foreign Policy in Latin America 
 

U.S. is dominant player in region since 1898 
•  Traditionally exercised a huge influence 
•  Even when it wasn’t intervening, often perceived to be 
•  Policy generally not well regarded in hemisphere 
•  Better relations now than ever, but still skepticism 
 
Prior to 1898, policy less clear 
•  Support for Spanish Revolutions  
•  Monroe Doctrine: no colonialism 
•  Some desire to trade with them 
•  Skepticism over prospects 
• 
Jefferson: “History furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining free civil 
government” 
•  Manifest Destiny and territorial expansion 
•  1846-8: Mexican-American War (and subsequent debate over citizenship) 
• 
consistent talk of annexing Cuba and Baja 
•  Rivalry with England 
•  Gradual dominance over Caribbean 
•  Ultimate dominance over South America 
 
Five familiar explanations for U.S policy 
•  Geopolitics 
•  U.S. trying to defend itself against perceived threats to national security 
•  European rivalry 
•  WWII 
•  Cold War 
•  Economic interests 
• 
Interests of U.S. as a whole 
• 
Interests of businesses, capitalism 
• 
Interests of specific individuals 
•  Domestic politics 
•  U.S. foreign policy just reflects domestic constituencies 
•  Cuban policy today 
• 
Impact of L.A. immigration? 
Ideology 
•  Promoting democracy 
•  Combating Communism 
•  Discussed a lot; is it just a veil for other interests (e.g., economic interests)?   
•  Or is it sincere (e.g., intervention in Haiti)? 
•  Bureaucratic politics 
•  Not one policy 
•  People, agencies jockey for power and influence within government 
•  Very important to note that policy is not coherent 
•  Conspiracy theory explanations vs. general incoherence explanations 

• 

 
People really differ in which of these seems most important 
•  Latin Americans:  economic issues key; all else is a guise or façade 
•  U.S. policymakers would insist on primacy of national interest 
•  U.S. citizens probably think in terms of ideology and democracy

Also, drivers of policy have changed a lot over time 
•  Four phases 

 
 
Modern period begins in 1898. Why? 
•  U.S. “liberates” or inherits Spanish colonial possessions 
•  Becomes the hegemonic force in the Caribbean basin 
•  Puerto Rico becomes a U.S. colony 
•  Cuba and Nicaragua turned into virtual colonies 
•  U.S. also starts to play a larger role in South America, where British are dominant 
• 
By 1920s, annual U.S. investment in region exceeds British 
• 
Though U.S. still smaller total fixed investment until WWII 

 
 

First phase:  Era of Imperialism:  1898-1932 
•  Why called imperialism?  [They called it that] 
•  Europe rushing to gain colonies; U.S. does the same, often using the language of “Manifest 
Destiny”: the U.S. was destined to be light to the underdeveloped regions of the hemisphere 
and save them from much worse European imperialism 
•  As Senator Albert Jeremiah Beveridge put it at the turn of the century:  “The time will come in 
the not-so-distant future when American enterprise will extend across the entire northern if not 
the entire southern continent…Our institutions will follow, and American laws, American 
civilization, & the American flag will plant themselves on shores hitherto bloody & benighted, by 
those agents of God henceforth made beautiful & bright.” 
•  Period of Dollar Diplomacy 
•  Goal is to make money 
• 
Investments, trade, loans  
•  Also called the period of Gunboat Diplomacy, with U.S. military interventions in Caribbean Basin 
to protect American interests and investments 
•  Nicaragua, 1912-25 
•  Haiti, 1914-34 
•  Dominican Republic, 1916-24 
•  Cuba, 1917-23 
•  Panama 
•  Mexico, 1914 and 1916 
•  Motivations for these interventions was often quite naked 
•  General Smedley Butler, who headed most of the interventions in the area, wrote a memoir of 
his adventures in the 1930s where he described himself as “a racketeer for Capitalism” and “a 
high-class muscle man for big business, Wall Street, and the bankers.” 
“I brought light to the Dominican Republic on behalf of the international investment house of 
Brown Brothers Harriman in 1906.  I Haiti ‘right’ for sugar interests in 1914.” 
•  This was much in keeping with the spirit of the times, when governments supported banks and 
private companies in their efforts to make money abroad 
•  Wilson had a different vision of the region 
•  Hemisphere of free-trading, liberal democracies 
•  Respect for the rule of law; multilateral internationalism 
•  Twisted in practice; gives way to unilateral U.S. military intervention

Second phase:  Depression and the Good Neighbor Policy, 1930-1948 
•  Costs of intervention mounting 
•  Especially in Nicaragua, where U.S. fighting a real guerrilla war  
•  With Depression, national mood hardly favors using American troops to bail out big businesses 
or bankers 
•  Hoover not given to intervention 
•  New policy accelerates under Roosevelt 
•  Progressive administration 
•  Ominous events in Europe 
•  World War II begins to loom 
•  Effects are varied  
•  Toleration of increasing leftism in Mexico, including oil nationalization 
•  Creation of “National Guards” to take place of U.S. troops 
• 
Invariably leads to the establishment of a dictatorship under the person in charge of the 
National Guard (Nicaragua, Cuba, etc.) 
•  Accomplishes main goal of support during WWII  
•  Most countries join war or at least break off relations with Germany 
•  Brazil sides with allies 
•  Others remain neutral, even Argentina (though with Axis sympathies) 
•  U.S. then supports the big wave of democracy and reform that occurs after WWII 
•  E.g., Brazilian military, which had served in Italy with Allies, overthrows Vargas 
•  But U.S. support or democratization gives way rapidly to Cold War rivalry and threat of 
Communism aided by Soviet Union 

 

Third phase: Cold War: 1948-1989 
•  U.S. becomes suspicious of attempts at social reform 
•  World seen as a giant political chessboard 
•  Real fear of subversion; some attempts by Communists to seize power (e.g., Costa Rica) 
•  But also tremendous hypersensitivity 
•  Geostrategic threat  
•  Opposition to nationalization of U.S. firms 
•  Fear that attempts at reform could hurt stable (undemocratic) allies 
•  General view is that democracy and reform are good things in principle, but that they may 
be dangerous in practice 
•  George Kennan, liberal architect of post-war world, in speech to American Ambassadors in 
the region in 1950:  “The Final answer may be an unpleasant one, but…we should not 
hesitate before police repression by the local government…It is better to have a strong 
regime in power than a liberal government if it is indulgent and relaxed and penetrated by 
Communists.” 
•  Allen Dulles, Director of CIA under Eisenhower, even more frank:  “The world is divided into 
two types of people: the Christian anti-communists, and the others” 
•  Policy leads to a series of interventions 
•  1954:  CIA-sponsored coup in Guatemala overthrows leftist government 
•  1961:  Failed Bay of Pigs intervention in Cuba to unseat Fidel Castro 
•  1964:  Military coup in Brazil against left-leaning government 
•  1965:  OAS-sponsored military intervention in Dominican Republic to prevent military 
victory of reformists over military 
•  1973:  Overthrow of democratically-elected Socialist government of Salvador Allende 
•  1979:  Grenadan Revolution 
•  1980s: In response to revolution in Nicaragua and revolutionary movements in El 
Salvador and Guatemala, proxy wars and military assistance.  Includes both right-

wing rebels in Nicaragua and very repressive military-dominated regimes in El 
Salvador and Guatemala 
•  Bouts of reformism under Democratic administrations in the U.S. 
•  Support for social democracy in Costa Rica in 1948 
•  Alliance for Progress in early 1960s 
•  Human rights policy under Jimmy Carter 
•  Tolerance of leftist-nationalist governments in Mexico 
•  But when push comes to shove, U.S tends to support right-wing dictatorships in the face of 
a Communist threat 
•  Alliance for Progress turns to military aid 
•  Carter favors intervention in Nicaragua and military aid in Salvador 

 
International economic policy 
•  Debt Crisis really puts Latin America on U.S. financial radar screen in 1980s 
•  Support for neoliberal economic reforms 
•  Negotiation of debt relief 
•  Presages 1990s, when economic issues and international cooperation come to the fore 
 
 

Fourth Phase:  Era of Gloablization (1989-present) 
•  Overthrow of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, reduction of international tensions, 
and finally break-up of Soviet Union 
•  Communism now no longer a threat; anti-communism not a policy that makes any sense 
•  Greater tolerance of reformism 
•  Strong support for new democracies 
•  Central American peace accords, which lead to democratization of Nicaragua, El 
Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala 
•  Endorsement of political transition in Mexico 
•  Behind-the-scenes maneuvering to foil coups in Guatemala and Paraguay 
•  Rejection of coup in Ecuador; force return to democratic elections recently 
•  Direct military intervention to restore democracy in Panama and Haiti 

 

 

•  Basically, though, the U.S. fails to seize the moment to create Wilson’s vision 
•  ambivalent of trade; FTAA fails to develop 
•  drug certification continues past 2002 
•  Some progress on hemispheric integration and establishment of multilateral 
efforts 

•  Once again, some important differences between Democratic and Republican 
administrations 
•  Clinton refuses to be baited by Chávez; Bush II appears to support coup 
•  Clinton administration explores more open relations with Cuba; Bush II 
administration accuses it of developing biological weapons 
•  Clinton administration favors restrained approach to Colombia, sensitive to issues 
of human rights; Bush II removes human rights restrictions and steps up 
counterinsurgency assistance 
•  Clinton administration pushes multilateral initiatives and launches Summit of the 
Americas; these initiatives are generally resisted by Republicans on the Hill

Summing up 
Variation across eras 
• 
Imperialist Era, economic interests dominant and often quite naked 
•  Good Neighbor Policy:  geopolitics important 
•  Cold War, geopolitics most important, but often satisfied; economics and ideology 
important; naked economic interest varies 
•  Globalization:  geostrategic concerns not an issue; economics and democracy 
promotion important; naked economic interest less clear  
•  Bureaucratic politics important when there is no crisis 

 
Substantial variation by Administration (Democrats vs. Republicans) 
•  Emphasis on democracy 
•  Nature of economic concerns and degree to which they influence policy 
•  Likely to continue in the future 
•  Overall, though, big trends depend on international context
