Session 15: Establishing Civilian Control Over the Military and Transitional Justice. 
 

Civil-Military Relations in Latin America 
 
Main causes of intervention 
•  Samuel Finer, The Man on Horseback:  “instead of asking why the military engage in 
politics, we ought surely to ask why they ever do otherwise.  For at first sight the 
political advantages of the military vis-à-vis other and civilian groupings are 
overwhelming.  The military possess vastly superior organization.  And the possess 
arms.” 1  
•  Need to define military intervention 
•  Coup or no coup 
o  Personal gain 
o  Crucial element is perception of civilian competence 
o  Civilian support 

 
Why does military leave power? 
•  Mission accomplished 
•  Worries about corrupting armed forces (professional institution) 
o  Military-as-government vs. military-as-institution 
•  Economy is falling apart; they turn it over to civilians 
o  E.g., Bolivia in 1982, Ecuador in 1977-79 
o 
in name of democracy, hand over mess  
•  Loss in war (Greece in 1974, Argentina in 1982) 
•  Tide is changing, cut a deal and get out while getting is good 
o  All military regimes face a fundamental problem of legitimacy 
o  By definition, rule by force; almost inherently don’t enjoy legitimacy 

 
Why does military cling to power? 
•  Residual threat (mission not accomplished) 
o  Guerrilla movements (e.g., Algeria) 
o  Perceived civilian incapacity (e.g., Argentina:  Peronists would win) 
o  Millenarial transformation that they dreamed of remains incomplete 
• 
Institution is already too corrupted 
•  Blood on their hands; afraid of what might happen to them

But simply asking whether or not there is a coup -- is this too simple a way of 
defining intervention? 
• 
If I avoid a coup, is that sufficient to say there is civilian control? 
•  Aren’t there gradations of military involvement 
•  Stepan, Trinkunas 

 
Strategies for constraining the military 
• 
Incorporation 
o  Create true people’s army a la classical Sparta  
o  Every able-bodied citizen (or at least every male) is a member; no difference 
between military and society  
o 
Impossible to imagine conducting a coup; against whom?  Against 
themselves? 
o  Advocated by Machiavelli, who loved this idea, and by revolutionaries 
subsequently; most recently by Gary Hart in his book The Minutemen 
o  Switzerland and Israel; few examples in Latin America, though Nicaragua 
might qualify during the revolutionary period (1979 to 1990) 
•  More common approach is to go the other direction 
o  Create an isolated, professional military 
o  Give them toys; let them have their own separate culture 
o  Potentially could launch a coup, but in practice is likely to be too small and 
isolated from rest of society to carry one off 
o 
In developing world:  Mexico 
(cid:131)  One of most impressive examples 
(cid:131)  Military simply not a major political actor in Mexico since 1940s 
(cid:131) 
In 1920s, totally by Revolutionary generals; rebellions common 
(cid:131)  Steadily shrunk military 
(cid:131)  Now, 5x as many unionized teachers as servicemen 
o  At the extreme, you abolish the army and just have a heavily armed police 
force (Panama, Costa Rica) 
•  What if you need a large army, but it also needs to be professional?  (e.g., U.S. and 
USSR in Cold War era) 
o  Most common solution, used in both US and USSR, is penetration 
o  U.S.:  Defense Department is all civilian; half-step above the military officers 
at each level of hierarchy 
o  USSR:  People’s commissars in each unit who report to Party; KGB spies 
o  Copied by number of other regimes; e.g., Vietnam, Cuba 
If all else fails… 
o  Divide and conquer 
(cid:131)  Venezuela:  inter-service rivalry; all spying on each other 
(cid:131)  Create separate force to balance military  
(cid:131)  danger of peeving military, or politicizing them (Venezuela) 
o  Mexico:  rumor during the 1970s: military had only three day’s supply of 
gasoline designed to hobble military 
o  Can be used in concert with other strategies  
(cid:131)  Mexico:  Navy separated from Army; small; resource-starved; isolated 
What happened in Brazil?   
•  Civilians really bided their time 
•  Appears to have worked, for the most part 
•  Military budgets cut, military industries privatized; military less of a political player 
than ever before in Brazil 
•  One thing they didn’t get, and will never get, is punishment for abuses committed 
under their regime

•  Basically, this is what Stepan would have advised them.  Sort of what Huntington 
would have advised as well 
•  Subtext of Stepan’s argument:  look at all the stuff you can get if you just give up on 
the human rights front
