"contemporary Latin American politics is something of a "living museum", in which all the 
forms of political authority of the Western historic experience continue to exist and operate, 
interacting one with another in a pageant that seems to violate all the rules of sequence and 
change involved in our understanding of the growth of Western civilization.  Politically 
pragmatic, democratic movements, devoted to the constitutional and welfare-state ideals of 
the mid-twentieth century, stand side by side with a traditional and virtually semi-feudal 
landed aristocracy.  "Social technocrats" and economic planners of the most modern outlook 
confer and interact with an institutionalized Church which in some countries is favored with 
a political position not far removed from the "two swords" tradition of medieval political 
thought.  Military caudillos cast in a role set in the early nineteenth century, and little 
changed with the passage of time, confront an organized trade union movement, a growing 
middle class, a new entrepreneurial elite."  (Anderson, Charles. Politics and Economic 
Change in Latin America: The Governing of Restless Nations. Princeton, NJ: Van Nostrand, 
1967, p. 104. ASIN: B000B9J54W.) 
 
Latin America is a region of contrasts 
•  Extraordinary wealth and massive poverty: Rio de Janeiro shantytown next to 
skyscraper: could be a lot of cities 
•  Peasants using technology from pre-Colombian era next to a giant office building 
•  Unlike any region in the United States, except perhaps areas of the American South 
where the legacy of slavery, poverty, and racial inequality is reminiscent of Latin 
America 

 
I will offer a history of the region in 30 minutes or less 
•  Many of the current contrasts in L.A. go back to Columbus and the Conquest 
•  Massive destruction of Indian population 
o 
Indians on Hispaniola eradicated by 1520 (little more than a generation after 
contact), in Cuba (which was one of next colonies) by 1540 
o  Population of Mexico fell calamitously, from perhaps 10 million to 3 million.  
Didn’t recover until the early 20th century 
o  Causes included overwork, starvation, and especially disease (smallpox), to 
which locals had no immunity 
o  Europeans died in droves too, of course.  Mortality rates of 40% within first 
year throughout the first half of the 16th century (malaria being especially bad 
killer) 
o  But Indians harder hit; Africans brought in to replace them

o  Thus the demographic composition of the Caribbean basis was utterly 
transformed 
o  Some describe it as the only region of the world entirely created by North 
Atlantic capitalism 
•  But colonialism left other demographic legacies as well 
o 
Intermarriage between Europeans, indigenous population, Africans   
o  Created the racial mix of region today 
o  Some countries have a very large African population (Haiti, Belize, Cuba, 
Dominican Republic, Caribbean coast of Central America, Suriname and 
Guyana, Venezuela, Brazil); others have zones where most of the population 
has some African ancestry (Colombia’s Chaco region, Mexico around Veracruz 
and in parts of Michoacan and Oaxaca states, Caribbean coast of Costa Rica) 
o  African slavery in much of the region 
o 
In other countries, where the indigenous population was very large, mainly a 
mix of indigenous and European (Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, 
Chile).  Some countries still have very large indigenous populations (Bolivia, 
Guatemala, Ecuador, Peru), and others have sizeable enclaves (Mexico, 
Chile), though non-westernized Indians really only a majority in Bolivia 
In other countries, mainly settled by Europeans (Argentina, Uruguay; to a 
lesser extent, Costa Rica, Chile) 
•  Color hierarchies all visible today 
o  Social structure of the Conquest 
o  Colonial and even early post-independence eras, dizzying array of terms used 
to describe skin color and classify people by race 
o  Still a strong correlation of skin color and income 
o  Skin color also a predictor of political views 
o  Sometimes, racism much more virulent (e.g., Central America) 
(cid:131)  Guatemalan upper-class women wouldn’t shave their legs, as hairless 
legs was an indicators of Indian heritage 
(cid:131) 
In El Salvador’s Matanza in 1932 led to the disappearance of all 
displays of indigenous identity 
o  Also shows up in dress 
(cid:131)  Those cute costumes in the highland villages of southern Mexico and 
Central America – Where do they come from 
(cid:131)  Relics of colonial social control 
(cid:131)  Designed to mark people as identified with a certain village

I have spoken of the legacy of the Conquest, but the Conquest was not a single 
event 
o  Much “easier” in some areas than in others 
o  Much more complete in some areas than in others 
o 
In Argentina and Uruguay, indigenous population exterminated or herded 
onto reservations (like U.S. and Canada) 
o 
In central Mexico, local indigenous elites intermarried with Spaniards, forming 
a new hierarchy.  At least one local prince even received title in Spain 
o 
In Peru, intact indigenous royal lines remained, sometimes leading revolts 
against Spanish authority (Tupac Amaru I) 
o 
In Paraguay, the Castilians were co-opted by Guaraní-speaking tribes, 
provided with women, and made captains of the indigenous armies; to this 
day, Paraguayans speak Guaraní as well as Spanish and maintain certain 
Indian customs (Like drinking mate tea) 
o  But lots of variation even within each of these areas (e.g., difference between 
Mexico’s central valley and the Yucatan)

Another important legacy of the Conquest was cultural:  Example of religion 
•  The region is predominantly Catholic 
•  But often quite nominal; religious practice is a blend of Roman and pagan rituals 
•  Day of the Dead in Mexico, celebrated on November 2 (All Souls Day) 
•  The further south you go and the more intact the indigenous community, the more 
the saints begin to look like Indian deities 
•  What is the irony here? 
• 
In Mexico, Catholic faithful pray to the dark-skinned Virgin of Guadalaupe (as 
opposed to the lighter skinned Virgin of los Remedios), who is also viewed as a 
symbol of nationhood 
•  But the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared to the Indian peasant Juan Diego in the 16th 
century on the same hill that had previously been the home to the Aztec goddess 
Tontzatzín; took a while to convince a skeptical local clergyman that she was a 
Christian symbol and to get the Church to build a shrine on that site 
“The Image they pray to is Christian, but only God knows what deity they pray to in 
their hearts” 
In other places, such as northeastern Brazil, blend of Christian and African 
spiritualism 
•  Recently, Protestantism has made inroads, especially among poorer and remote 
populations that had not been religiously served.  Evangelicals take a very different 
attitude toward blending of religious practices – much less tolerant.   
•  We will talk about all these religious issues later in the class 
•  Also, we will talk about effect of religion on politics.   
o  There has been a big change over last 40 years in Church, with crucial 
implications for its social role

What about the economic legacies of the Conquest? 
o 
In Caribbean, Mexico, and elsewhere, Indians were given to Spaniards; essentially 
serfdom; in exchange, Spaniards were supposed to look out for them and 
Christianize them; this was known as encomienda 
o  Didn’t work too well; Castillians tended to run through “their” Indians pretty fast 
o  Spanish and Portuguese instituted a new system known as latifundia   
o  What was that? 
o  Not very efficient; latifundistas disinclined to invest 
o  Gradually latifundium gave way to heritable plantation system, called hacienda 
o  Grew cash crops (sugar, cacao, ultimately coffee); often combined with some 
processing 
o  Lasted until the 20th century in many areas 
o  Perpetuated highly unequal distribution of land and wealth 
o  One feature of almost all these systems was dependence on foreign interests 
o  Not designed to serve needs of local population, even local landlords 
o  Designed to milk the colonies, supply raw materials for mother country, as 
well as gold and silver 
o  What was this system called? 
 
o 
In practice, dependence on Iberia really meant dependence on England 
o  Dependent relationships persisted after Independence; in many places, 
ultimately became dependence on U.S.  
o  As a result, L.A. was often a step behind in development; development itself 
was often skewed and uneven 
o  We’ll discuss the challenges of economic development next week

Finally, political legacies of the Conquest 
•  Spanish and Portuguese tried to institute highly centralized rule, but often not very 
thorough or effective 
o  Very hard to administer across the ocean 
o  Local realities vs. demands of the central authority 
o  Substantial corruption; legacy which continues to this day 
o  Law poorly enforced and heavily biased 
•  Most countries became independent during the first part of 19th century 
•  Republican norms and laws prevailed, at least in theory 
o  Democratic constitutions, often modeled after U.S. or to a lesser extent 
France, but practice lags 
o  Disjunctures between Theory vs. Practice (or Practice vs. Pretense) 
o  Elections:  The Portuguese had saying that was later applied to Brazil  
(cid:131)  Why hold elections where only a tiny percentage of the population can 
vote, and even then the outcome is rigged? 
(cid:131)  Answer:   para ingles ver (“so the English can see”) 
•  Tremendous political inequalities 
•  Political values (i.e., political culture) not particularly civic 

 
So what is overall shape of the region? 
•  Tremendous social inequalities, often correlated with skin color  
•  Cultural Catholicism 
•  Weak political institutions and hybrid political systems 
•  High levels of urbanization, but also extensive poverty 
•  Often, the combination of weak institutions, unrepresentative government, massive 
inequality, and rural poverty produced insurgencies 
o  For most of the 20th century, most Latin American countries have had some 
sort of lingering rural insurgency that operates in certain areas 
o  We will talk about revolutionary movements in a few weeks 

 
Beyond this, very hard to generalize across a region that’s incredibly diverse.   
•  Economic development varies from Cuba and Haiti to Argentina and Chile   
o  Even within a single country, regional disparities between Northern and 
Southern Brazil defy generalization 
•  Politically, some places that have never really had democracy (e.g., Guatemala, 
Paraguay, Cuba); some places that have been stable and democratic longer than 
most of Western Europe (Costa Rica) 
o  Some places have had real social revolution (Mexico, Bolivia, Cuba, 
Nicaragua) 
o  others have experienced massive redistribution programs carried out from 
above (Argentina under Peron, Venezuela under AD, Peru under military) 

 
In other words, we have approached the limits of bland generalities; indeed, I’ve already 
gone too far in generalizing. 
o  When I spoke of the end of colonial rule, I neglected to mention that Cuba 
was still a colony of Spain in 1898 
o  When I talked about how independence led to the adoption of republican 
institutions, I neglected to mention that Mexico was an Empire twice in the 
19th Century, first under Iturbide in 1821 and then Maximilian of Austria; 
meanwhile, Brazil became independent as a monarchy, and remained a 
monarchy until the 1880s 
o  When I talked about land tenure patterns, I neglected to mention that Costa 
Rica was largely settled by yeomen farmers

o  When I talked about race, I didn’t mention Lebanese and Palestinian 
merchants, Chinese brought in as coolies, Japanese indentured farmers, 
Mennonite communities scattered in Central America, Mexico, Paraguay, and 
Brazil; Irish who settled in Mexican territory before it was stolen by the United 
States 
o  Slavery was abolished in Mexico early in the 19th century and thought of as 
outlandish; but totally normal in Cuba and Brazil until eve of the 20th century 

 
Brief overview of the readings for next week 
o  Big Mama’s Funeral 
•  A short story by Colombian author and Nobel Laureate Gabriel García 
Márquez  (explain naming system:  García is his patronymic) 
• 
Inventor of “magical realism” style 
•  You should make sure to read it before class, as we will discuss it then; it 
is meant to be funny, but more likely to see the humor the first time if you 
know the region well 
•  We will re-read this at the end of the semester 
 
o  Winn, Chapters 1-2 
• 
Describes three types of countries 
• 
Mulatto (Caribbean, Brazil, parts of other countries) 
• 
Mestizo (Mexico, Central America, Colombia, Venezuela, 
Peru,etc.) 
 
• 
European (Argentina, Uruguay, Costa Rica?) 
• 
Good overview of peoples and geography 
• 
A little turgid and heavy on exploitation 
• 
Chapter 2, on colonial period, reads better
