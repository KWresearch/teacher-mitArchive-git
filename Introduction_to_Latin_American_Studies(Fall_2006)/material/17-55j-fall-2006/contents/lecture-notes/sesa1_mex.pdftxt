Appendix: Political Transition in Mexico 
 

 

•  Zapata, Villa, Carranza, Obregon,  
•  PNR (cid:198) PRM (cid:198) PRI 
•  3 Sectors of PRI 
•  Mexican presidents on Left and Right 

 
Mexico in 1910 
•  Finally recovered from years of social unrest in the previous century 
•  Under the rule of a “modernizing dictator”, Porfirio Díaz 
•  Thirty-five years of economic growth and stability 
•  But problems beneath the surface 
•  Wealth has become unbelievably concentrated in the hands of a few hundred families 
• 
Impoverishment of half the population 
•  Encroachment on lands, especially indigenous lands 
•  Total lack of political competition 
•  Urban middle classes and small industrial working class that’s excluded from system; 
pressuring for change 
•  Diaz agrees to hold fair election 
•  Wealthy liberal landowner, Francisco Madero, announces his opposition candidacy 
•  Country is ready for change 
•  Díaz steals election 
 
The Revolution 
•  Madero, from exile, calls for armed rebellion 
•  Triggers massive conflagration that last for years, called the Mexican Revolution 
•  Díaz:  “Madero has unleashed a tiger.  Let us see if he can ride him.” 
•  He can’t; Madero who succeeds in taking power but is then killed in a reactionary military coup 
•  years of bloodshed; economy drops 25-50%; 1M people dead, including many of the other 
leaders of Revolution, during a long war of attrition 
•  Three groups:  reactionaries who want to bring back the old regime fight the Constitutionalists, 
who want to avenge Madero 
•  Then, radicals and moderates fight 
•  Radicals led by Zapata (poor Indians) and Villa (northern dispossessed) 
• 
“Moderates” led by Venustiano Carranza and others (middle-classes and workers) 
•  Finally, moderates fight among themselves 
•  By 1917, group of northern generals has beaten other factions 
•  Emiliano Zapata killed in 1919 
•  Pancho Villa killed in 1923 
•  Alvaro Obregón 
•  Radical options defeated, but completely turning the clock back impossible 
•  Two main legacies 
•  Progressive Constitution, created in 1917 
•  Honored in the breech 
•  Social reform has not yet reached much of Mexico  
•  Destruction of state authority; warlordism (caciques) 

 
In 1928, Obregón is assassinated

•  Plutarcho Elías Calles, ruling party (National Revolutionary Party or PNR) 
•  Committee of surviving revolutionary generals 
•  Makes deals with the local warlords (caciques) in return for their loyalty 
•  Lázaro Cárdenas becomes president in 1934 
•  Forces Calles into exile 
•  Delivers on promises of social reform 
•  Public education 
•  Sweeping land reform 
•  Nationalization of enterprises, especially U.S. oil companies 
•  Politically, ruling party now has a mass base 
•  1938:  Party of the Mexican Revolution (PRM) 
•  Organized by sectors 
•  Massive state bureaucracy 
•  Military chieftains brought under control 
•  Warlords co-opted 
•  One-party political rule established 
•  Ultimately, party name is changed to PRI 
•  Major factions divided into camarillas 
•  Fight over power 
•  Big left-right divide; presidency seems to shift among factions 
• 
Iron-clad rule:  no reelection 
• 
“Effective suffrage and no reelection” was Madero’s slogan 
•  Coordinating committee of elites 
•  Held together by corruption; everyone gets a cut at the spoils 
•  Pluralistic, but not democratic 
•  Other parties have place at margin of system 
•  Main labor unions and associations controlled by ruling party 
•  Press co-opted 
•  Caciques at the local level 
•  Gonzalo Santos:  Some generals established themselves strongly in states or regions 
and constructed local domains (cacicazgos) run with an iron hand.   The State did not 
oppose them but made use of them for its own benefit.  “You obey me, I protect you,” 
was the golden rule….A truly perfect example of this process was Gonzalo N. Santos who 
inherited the cacicazgo…in the state of San Luis Potosí.  A founding member (card no. 6) 
of the PNR, professional organizer of victorious electoral campaigns by hook or by crook, 
soldier, congressman, senator when necessary, Santos had accumulated tens of 
thousands of hectares under the protection of the Revolution.  He had twelve thousand 
armed men, “his Huastecos”, under his direct command.  At the end of his life, he did an 
extremely rare thing for a Mexican politician.  He produced his own memoirs – cheerful, 
macabre, and very well written.  And so we know – from his own testimony – that his 
professional killers accompanied him wherever he went.  If a priest preached against 
him, he calmly had him shot.  If he liked a piece of land, he would approach the owner 
and ask him to set a price.  If the owner refused or seemed doubtful, Santos would 
throw up his hands:  “Let his widow decide!” 
In exchange for impunity within his territory, Santos contributed significant services “to the 
Revolution.”  In the elections of 1929, a newspaper in his capital city reported, “When more 
than 2,000 people had collected, two trucks full of PNR policemen began to fire on the crowd 
with Thompson machine guns.”…On the day of the 1940 elections, he covered himself with 
glory.  In his memoirs, he describes “the bloody elections of 1940” with absolute honesty and 
sincerity, as if it had been a military campaign. 

‘We moved against the polling station with our guns out and since there were some 
shots fired at us we responded with energy, firing away freely.  We grabbed all the

ballot boxes full of votes for the opposition candidate and we broke them and we 
carried away all the papers and records and ballots and so on.… 
At another polling station, he discussed the procedure with the poll-watchers: 
‘I said to the poll-watchers, ‘when you transcribe the voting list and fill up the box at 
voting time, don’t discriminate against the dead because they’re all citizens and they 
have their right to vote.’

Other great quotes from Santos: 
• 
“I have no need for administrators in my state, only gravediggers” 
• 
 “Should I go to hell, I’m used to hot country.”  
(Krauze, Enrique. Mexico: Biography of Power:  A History of Modern Mexico, 1810-1996. 
New York, NY: Harper Collins Publishers, 1997. pp. 644-45. ISBN: 0060163259.) 

 
This system lasts pretty well until the late 1960s

•  Symbols of Mexican Revolution 
•  Nationalism 
•  Political stability after a long period of upheaval 
•  Economy growing 
•  Lots of foreign investment 
•  Good prices for Mexican exports 
•  Macro-economic management is insulated 
•  Corruption relatively contained 
 
But it’s increasingly undone after 1970 
•  No constraints on corruption 
•  Unless the president is mindful it will expand 
•  State grows; opportunities for corruption expand 
•  Economic policy runs into problems related to ISI 
•  Uncompetitive industries 
•  Macroeconomic policy becomes object of political fighting 
•  1973:  President Echeverria fires his Finance Minister 
•  Central Bank loses independence 
•  Factions of PRI now have incentive to manipulate the economy more 
• 
Increased infighting within PRI 
•  Finally, public opposition grows 
•  System set up to manage peasant population 
•  Now, population is mostly urban 
•  1950: 
25% live in cities of over 20,000 
•  1980: 
43% 
•  Education 
•  1950: 
•  1980: 
•  Communication 
•  1950: 
•  1980: 
•  Service sector 
•  1950:  
service sector 20% of labor force 
•  1980: 
35% 
this population is much harder to control 
•  educated, literate, well-informed, urban middle-class that’s not part of PRI political 
machine 

0% of households have television; 10% have radio 
25% television; most have radio 

57% know how to read and write 
84%
