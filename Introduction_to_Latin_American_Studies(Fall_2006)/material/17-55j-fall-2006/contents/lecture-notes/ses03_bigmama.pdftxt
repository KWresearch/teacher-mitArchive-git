Session 3: Class Discussion of Big Mama’s Funeral 
 

Introduction to Big Mama’s Funeral 
•  Macondo is the site of Garcia Marquez’s novels 
o  a magical town in rural Colombia where outrageous facts meet mundane 
fantasies 
o  Meant to be a microcosm of Latin America 
•  Story is supposed to be very funny 

 
Big Mama is matriarch of Macondo; represents the past 
•  92 years old (1492-1992?)  
•  virgin; no children; heirs are 9 nieces and nephews 
o  oldest is Nicanor 
o  One niece, Magdalena, renounces marriage for Church and gets a diamond 
ring but nothing else in the will 
o  Lots of bastard children fathered by men 
•  Big Mama owns all the land; government pays her for citizens use of streets; no one 
in Macondo owns any land except her 
•  Receives and delivers votes of all living and dead in her domain 
•  Usury rights passed on to relatives 
•  Long justification of her rule (“immaterial possessions”) 
•  She represents “Class over common people” and “traditional power over transitory 
authority” 
•  Unifying event in country and world as all join in effort to bury her 
o  Effort is to “bury her”, not to “pay respects” or “honor her” 
•  Priest:  Father Anthony Isabel 

 
Questions for class discussion 
•  Question #1:  When does story take place? 

 

 

•  Question #2:  What do you suppose Big Mama looked like? Three pictures:  Afro-
spiritist leader, Queen Victoria, Frida Khalo 

 
•  Question #3:  Is Macondo a democracy? 
 
•  Question #4:  Decentralization is often touted as a remedy for many of Latin 
America’s ills.  In democracy, idea is to locate government closer to the people and 
thus make it more accountable.  Would decentralization work as a political strategy 
in this case?   

•  Question #5:  What does Big Mama represent?  What does her death represent?  

 
Notes on these points 
•  Time (“living museum” quality to Macondo) 
o  p. 162: Big Mama was 21 at the beginning of the century 
o  Does it feel older? 
o  How do people arrive?  Boat?  Plane?  Etc. 
o  Medical technologies used on Big Mama (seem so incredibly antiquated) 
•  Rule of law
