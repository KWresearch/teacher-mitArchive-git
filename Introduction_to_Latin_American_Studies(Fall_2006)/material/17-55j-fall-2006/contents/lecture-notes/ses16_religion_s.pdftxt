Changes in Catholic Doctrine

Brazil’s bishops in 1915 told to  “inculcate the spirit of obedience and 
submission to those who govern in civil society…to lead the faithful to 
accept their proper situation and the conditions under which they were 
born.”1

Since Vatican II, totally different doctrine; requires active social work 
(1960s)

Bishop Dom Adriano Hypolito of Nova Iguaçu:  “We have an evangelical 
commitment to make a preferential option for the poor….It’s not enough 
just to talk and pray.  As a Christian and a pastor, I feel I have a duty to 
support movements that work for the good of the people.”2
