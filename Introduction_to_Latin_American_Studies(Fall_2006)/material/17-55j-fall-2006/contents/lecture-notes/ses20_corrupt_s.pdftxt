Mexico’s 2006 presidential election:  an overview

Two main trends
1. Decline in AMLO relative to Felipe
2. Decline in Madrazo, relative to both

Main reasons for these trends
For PRI, a Greek tragedy
1.
2.
For AMLO, mainly a Christian tragedy (AMLO’s to lose)
Fox factor and incumbent performance
•
•
Success of negative campaign against AMLO
•
Other factors far less important
3. Monday morning quarterbacking?

Conclusions for Mexican voting behavior
1. Region over class
2.
Valence over positional issues (exception: electricity sector)
Candidate traits and issue-ownership
•
•
Incumbent performance
•
A referendum on AMLO
3. Downsian model largely useless

Implications for Mexican democracy
1. Worst possible outcome
