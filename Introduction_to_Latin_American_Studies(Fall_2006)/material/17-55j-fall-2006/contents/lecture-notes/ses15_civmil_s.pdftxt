Strategies for Establishing Civilian Control

Expansion 
• Mass conscription, tiny professional officer corps
• “Citizens’ Army”
• Advocates:  Machiavelli, Gary Hart
• Examples:  Switzerland, Israel, Nicaragua (Sandinista People’s Army)
Shrinkage and isolation
• Very small, professionalized army (at the extreme, abolition)
• Limit most dangerous branches (e.g., army)
• Advocates:  Lázaro Cárdenas, Bill Perry
• Examples: Canada, Japan, Mexico (five times as many teachers), Panama, 
Costa Rica
Penetration
• Parallel civilian hierarchies with strict oversight at all levels; need for civilian 
expertise
• Advocate:  Leon Trotsky, Dick Cheney
• Examples:  USSR, U.S.
Fragmentation and hobbling
• Divide and conquer; create rival agencies and inter-service rivalry
• Examples:  Libya, Venezuela, Mexico
