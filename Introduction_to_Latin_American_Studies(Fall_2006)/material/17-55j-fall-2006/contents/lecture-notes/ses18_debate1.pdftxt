Session 18: Class Debate 
 

 
First debate topic 
Resolved:  Chile's current democratic leaders should prosecute General Augusto 
Pinochet for his role in human rights abuses perpetrated under the military regime 
(1973-1990). 
 
Teams 
Team 1A (affirmative)   
Team 1B (negative)   
Team 2A (affirmative)   
Team 2B (negative)   
Judges 
 
There will be two debates:  one between Team 1A and Team 1B; the next between 
teams 1B and 2B.  Speakers on the affirmative teams will defend prosecution; 
speakers on the negative teams will oppose it.  Judges will then each render a 2-
minute verdict. 
 
The first speaker from each team will make a two-minute opening statement laying 
out her team's overall position.  The second speaker from each team will then have 
two minutes to rebut the arguments made by the other teams. The third speaker 
from each team will then be allowed three minutes to cross-examine her counterpart 
on the opposing team, who must defend her team's position with brief and direct 
replies.  The fourth speaker on each team will then have two minutes to summarize 
her team's arguments, addressing any weaknesses that have been exposed and 
pointing out weaknesses in the other team's positions.  After we have held the first 
debate, we will move on to the second debate.  Time permitting, we will then open 
up the class to general discussion. 
 
Please note that we will time each presentation strictly, so that you should prepare 
and practice your comments in advance.  You will also want to talk among your team 
members to iron out your overall strategy.  In most cases, this will require 
anticipating the strengths and weaknesses of each side of the debate, drawing on 
your knowledge of the Chilean case from readings, films, and lectures.   
 
Because of time constraints, we will begin promptly.  Lateness will be penalized in a 
draconian fashion.
