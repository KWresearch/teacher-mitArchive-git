Sessions 7: Questions for Class Presentations on Development in Latin America 
 
Note that this story about chinchillas is in here for a reason 
•  Not there by accident.   
•  Seems to be explicitly intended as a metaphor for underdevelopment in Chile 
•  Chinchilla history: http://members.aol.com/sirchin/chinhist.htm#history 
 
 
Class presentations 
•  What are the main tenets of dependency theory? 
•  Why did Mexico develop slowly in the 19th and early 20th century, according to 
Haber? 
•  How would Haber explain the failure of the chinchilla industry in House of the Spirits? 
•  Explain the failure of the chinchilla industry in House of the Spirits from a cultural 
perspective. 
•  Explain the failure of the chinchilla industry in House of the Spirits from a 
dependency perspective. 

 
Wrap up on theories of development 
•  To some extent, these different theories can be viewed as complementary.   
•  Some may work better in some cases than others 
•  For instance, the Mexican steroid hormone industry looks  
•  The Brazilian petrochemical industry looks exactly the opposite, and more like 
Modernization Theory 
•  The failure of Mexican small and medium-sized businesses to take advantage of 
NAFTA and compete effectively in industries like furniture, footwear, and silver 
jewelry – where they should have had a comparative advantage – may have 
something to do with culture.   
o  Example:  Michael Piore on quality control & training in those industries 
o  Example:  Low trust between Taxco silver jewelers that I met 
•  You may also agree with the diagnosis that some theories offer, but not their cure 
o  Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was one of the founders of 
Dependency theory, but he advocates economic reform and integration with 
the rest of the world 
o  He may attempt to use the state to get the best deal he can for Brazil on 
certain issues (e.g., technology transfer), but has totally rejected autarkic 
development 

 
If you had to pick one paradigm or theory as your main lens for understanding Latin 
American development, which would you choose?
