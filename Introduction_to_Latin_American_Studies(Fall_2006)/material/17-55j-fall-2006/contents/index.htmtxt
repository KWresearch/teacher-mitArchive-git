***** Course Description *****
Interdisciplinary introduction to contemporary Latin America, drawing on films,
literature, popular press accounts, and scholarly research. Topics include
economic development, ethnic and racial identity, religion, revolution,
democracy, transitional justice, and the rule of law. Examples draw on a range
of countries in the region, especially Mexico, Chile, and Brazil. Includes a
heavy oral participation component, with regular breakout groups, formal class
presentations on pressing social issues (such as criminal justice and land
tenure), and a structured class debate.
