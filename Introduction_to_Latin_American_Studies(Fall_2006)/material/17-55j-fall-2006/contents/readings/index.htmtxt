Weekly readings range from 75 to 130 pages, or about 100 pages on average.
Readings include articles from the popular press, literary works, and scholarly
research from the social sciences.
If your first language is not English, you should still try to read the non-
literary works in English. For literary works (such as GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez and
Allende), however, please feel free to read them in the original.
Readings are normally due on the first day of class of the week in which they
are assigned. Where the first day is entirely occupied by a lecture, however,
you may wait until later in the week.
Many weekly readings are accompanied by videos or films, which are an integral
part of the course. Videos from the Americas series, produced in part by WGBH-
Boston, are one hour each. Please note that the film The Battle of Chile is
very long, so you should plan in advance.
