Final Exam 

 
The exam will have two parts:  an essay component and an ID component.  Both will be 
weighed equally.   
 
The ID portion of the exam will be closed book and closed note.   ID answers should be 
1-2 paragraphs each, and should identify the ID item, place it in context, and explain its 
importance.  (The exception is items from the map test, for which you should just identify 
the place on the map or place something on the blank map, as appropriate).   
 
The essay portion of the exam, which will be open-book and open-note, will include only 
ONE topic from the list of three, chosen at random.  You must write the essay in class, 
but you may use any notes or other materials you bring with you.  We recommend that 
you prepare detailed outlines of all three questions in advance.  You may collaborate in 
the sense of discussing these questions ahead of time with other students, but you should 
draw up your own outlines and answers. 
 
Citations for an in-class exam do not need to be formal.  If the citation is from the 
syllabus, the author's name in parentheses will suffice.  Lecture can be cited as “(Lawson, 
Date)”.  If the citation involves a specific fact or quote, you should include a page 
number.  If you cite a work not included in the syllabus, you should include the full 
formal citation. 
 

Potential essay topics 
 
1.  Gabriel García Márquez’s fictitious village Macondo is often described as a 
microcosm of Latin America.   Which features does García Márquez portray 
accurately?  Which does he exaggerate?  Which does he downplay or ignore 
altogether? 

 

 
2.  Next week you find yourself talking with an acquaintance who has recently returned 
from vacation in Mexico.  She remarks (boorishly) on how poor the country seems in 
comparison to the United States and how weak the rule of law seems to be.  The 
reason, she feels, is that Mexicans have a different attitude toward time, civic 
responsibility, and financial dealings.  As she puts it:  “They are always talking about 
mañana, and everyone is on the take.”  What sort of an explanation is this for 
underdevelopment and authoritarianism in Mexico?  Do you agree with this 
perspective?  What other explanations might you offer for relative poverty and weak 
rule of law in Mexico? 

 
3.  Evaluate the following statement:  “Neoliberal democracy in Latin America is either a 
farce or a fraud, a comedy or a tragedy, depending on one’s perspective; it is certainly 
no cure for the region’s ills.  The real problems that average Latin Americans 
confront – poverty, corruption, abuse at the hands of an indifferent state – remain 
unchanged.”
