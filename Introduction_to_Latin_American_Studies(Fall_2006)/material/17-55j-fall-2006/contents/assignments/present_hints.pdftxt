Hints for Class Presentations 

 
1.  Practice. 
 
2.  Get in and get out gracefully. 
•  Make sure you have a good opening and closing line 
•  Provide an orienting context, a reply or follow-up to what someone else has 
just said, an acknowledgement of the previous speaker, etc. 
If you are part of a team, conclude with a good hand-off to the next speaker 

• 
 
3.  Give a roadmap of your presentation:  (1) tell them what you’re going to tell them, (2) 
tell them, and (3) tell them what you told them.   

 
4.  Organize your presentation in a format that makes them easy to absorb – e.g., 1, 2, 3, 
summary. 

 
5.  If the presentation is to be longer than a few minutes, use visual aids to orient and 
engage your audience.  Slides are often better than handouts, as there is often a 
danger that the audience will start flipping through the handouts noisily, distracting 
others and sometimes themselves.  For the graphical presentation of data, consult 
Edward Tufte, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, 2nd Edition (Cheshire, 
England: Graphics Press, 2001). 

 
6.  Where possible, invite questions and audience participation.  If you think you might 
be pressed for time, however, make sure to wait until you have finished your 
presentation to take questions. 

 
7.  If your will be interrogated or cross-examined afterward (for example, if you are 
presenting to an academic audience or a legislative oversight body), anticipate the 
questions that you may be asked and come with prepared answers.  If you do not like 
the question and cannot answer it, say why it’s the wrong question, explain what the 
right question is, and answer that one. 

 
8.  Practice. 
 
9.  Practice again. 
 
10. And finally, PRACTICE! 
 
 
*****If you want to sound smart but are not slated to present, prepare a question on the 
materials to ask at the appropriate time.*****
