PRE-LAB READING 

INTRODUCTION 
 
As most  children  know,  if  you  get  a  push  on  a  swing  and  just  sit  still  on  it,  you  will  go 
back  and  forth,  gradually  slowing  down  to  a  stop.    If,  on  the  other  hand,  you move  your 
body  back  and  forth  you  can  drive  the  swing,  making  it  swing  higher  and  higher.    This 
only  works  if  you  move  at  the  correct  rate  though  –  too  fast  or  too  slow  and  the  swing 
will do nothing. 
 
This  is  an  example  of  resonance  in  a mechanical  system.    In  this  lab we will  explore  its 
electrical  analog  –  the RLC  (resistor,  inductor,  capacitor)  circuit  –  and  better  understand 
what happens when  it  is undriven and when  it  is driven above, below and at  the  resonant 
frequency. 
 
The Details:  Oscillations 
 
In  this  lab you will be  investigating current and voltages  (EMFs)  in RLC circuits.   These 
oscillate  as  a  function  of  time,  either  continuously  (Fig.  1a,  for  driven  circuits)  or  in  a 
decaying fashion (Fig. 1b, for undriven circuits).

Undriven Circuits:  Thinking about Oscillations 
 
Consider  the RLC  circuit  of  fig.  2  below.   The  capacitor  has  an  initial  charge Q0  (it was 
charged by a battery no longer in the circuit), but it can’t go anywhere because the switch 
is open.   When  the  switch  is  closed,  the positive  charge will  flow off  the  top plate of  the 
capacitor,  through  the  resistor  and  inductor,  and  on  to  the  bottom  plate  of  the  capacitor.  
This  is  the  same  behavior  that  we  saw  in  RC  circuits.    In  those  circuits,  however,  the 
current flow stops as soon as all  the positive charge has flowed  to  the negatively charged 
plate,  leaving  both  plates  with  zero  charge.    The  addition  of  an  inductor,  however, 
introduces  inertia  into  the circuit, keeping  the current  flowing even when  the capacitor  is 
completely discharged, and forcing it to charge in the opposite polarity (Fig 2b).

Figure  2  Undriven  RLC  circuit.    (a)  For  t<0  the  switch  S  is  open  and  although  the 
capacitor  is  charged  (Q  =  Q0)  no  current  flows  in  the  circuit.    (b)  A  half  period  after 
closing  the  switch  the  capacitor  again  comes  to  a  maximum  charge,  this  time  with  the 
positive charge on the lower plate. 
 
This  oscillation  of  positive  charge  from  the  upper  to  lower  plate  of  the  capacitor  is  only 
one of the oscillations occurring in the circuit.  For the two times pictured above (t=0 and 
t=0.5 T) the charge on the capacitor is a maximum and no current flows in the circuit.  At 
intermediate  times  current  is  flowing,  and,  for  example,  at  t  =  0.25  T  the  current  is  a 
maximum and  the charge on  the capacitor  is zero.   Thus another oscillation  in  the circuit 
is  between  charge  on  the  capacitor  and  current  in  the  circuit.    This  corresponds  to  yet 
another  oscillation  in  the  circuit,  that  of  energy  between  the  capacitor  and  the  inductor.

energy between  the capacitor and  inductor would be perfect and  the current  (and voltage 
across  the  capacitor  and  EMF  induced  by  the  inductor) would  oscillate  as  in  Fig.  1a.   A 
resistor, however, damps the circuit, removing energy by dissipating power through Joule 
heating (P=I2R), and eventually ringing the current down to zero, as in Fig. 1b.  Note that 
only  the  resistor  dissipates  power.    The  capacitor  and  inductor  both  store  energy  during 
half the cycle and then completely release it during the other half.

Driven Circuits:  Resonance 
 
Instead of simply charging  the capacitor and  then  letting  the system go, we could  instead 
add a battery that periodically pushed current through the system.  Such a battery is called 
an  AC  (alternating  current)  function  generator,  and  the  voltage  it  generates  can  oscillate 
with a given amplitude, frequency and shape (in this lab we will use a sine wave).  When 
hooked  up  to  an  RLC  circuit  we  get  a  driven  RLC  circuit  (Fig.  3a)  where  the  current 
oscillates at the same frequency as, but not necessarily in phase with, the driving voltage.  
The  amplitude  of  the  current  depends  on  the  driving  frequency,  reaching  a  maximum 
when the function generator drives at the resonant frequency, just like a swing (Fig. 3b)

One Element at a Time 
 
In order  to understand how  this  resonance happens  in  an RLC  circuit,  its  easiest  to build 
up an intuition of how each individual circuit element responds to oscillating currents.  A 
resistor  obeys  Ohm’s  law:    V  =  IR.    It  doesn’t  care  whether  the  current  is  constant  or 
oscillating  –  the  amplitude  of  voltage  doesn’t  depend  on  the  frequency  and  neither  does 
the phase (the response voltage is always in phase with the current). 
 
A  capacitor  is  different.    Here  if  you  drive  current  at  a  low  frequency  the  capacitor  will 
fill up and have a large voltage across it, whereas if you drive current at a high frequency 
the  capacitor  will  begin  discharging  before  it  has  a  chance  to  completely  charge,  and 
hence  it  won’t  build  up  as  large  a  voltage.    We  see  that  the  voltage  is  frequency 
dependent and that the current leads the voltage (with an uncharged capacitor you see the 
current flow and then the charge/potential on the capacitor build up). 
 
Figure 4 Current and Voltage for a Capacitor 
A  capacitor  driven  with  a  sinusoidal  current  will 
develop  a  voltage  that  lags  the  current  by  90º  (the 
voltage  peak  comes  ¼  period  later  than  the  current 
peak).

An  inductor  is  similar  to  a  capacitor  but  the  opposite.    The  voltage  is  still  frequency 
dependent  but  the  inductor  will  have  a  larger  voltage  when  the  frequency  is  high  (it 
doesn’t  like change and high  frequency means  lots of change).   Now  the current  lags  the 
voltage  –  if  you  try  to  drive  a  current  through  an  inductor  with  no  current  in  it,  the 
inductor will  immediately  put  up  a  fight  (create  an EMF)  and  then  later  allow  current  to 
flow. 
 
When  we  put  these  elements  together  we  will  see  that  at  low  frequencies  the  capacitor 
will  “dominate”  (it  fills  up  limiting  the  current)  and  current  will  lead  whereas  at  high 
frequencies  the  inductor  will  dominate  (it  fights  the  rapid  changes)  and  current  will  lag.  
At  resonance  the  frequency  is  such  that  these  two  effects balance  and  the  current will be 
largest  in  the  circuit.    Also  at  this  frequency  the  current  is  in  phase  with  the  driving 
voltage (the AC function generator). 
 
Resistance, Reactance and Impedance 
 
We  can  make  the  relationship  between  the  magnitude  of  the  current  through  a  circuit 
element  and  magnitude  of  the  voltage  drop  across  it  (or  EMF  generated  by  it  for  an 
inductor)  more  concrete  by  introducing  the  idea  of  impedance.    Impedance  (usually 
denoted  by  Z)  is  a  generalized  resistance,  and  is  composed  of  two  parts  –  resistance  (R) 
and  reactance  (X).    All  of  these  terms  refer  to  a  constant  of  proportionality  between  the 
magnitude  of  current  through  and  voltage  across  (EMF  generated  by)  a  circuit  element:  
V0 = I0Z, V = IR, V0 = I0X.  The difference is in the phase between the current and voltage.  
In  an  element with  only  resistance  (a  resistor)  the  current  through  it  is  in  phase with  the 
voltage  across  it.    In  an  element  with  only  reactance  (capacitor,  inductor)  the  current 
leads  or  lags  the  voltage  by  90º.    A  combination  of  these  elements  in  series  or  parallel 
will  lead  to a circuit with  impedance  Z = R 2 + X 2 and a phase  that depends on  the ratio 
of  the  reactance  and  resistance:  tanϕ= X R  (note  that  the  phase  φ  has  the  correct 
behavior as  X
R

The reactance of an  inductor  X L =ωL  and of a capacitor  X C = −1 ωC .   First of all, note 
that  these  have  the  correct  frequency  dependence.    An  inductor  has  a  high  reactance  at 
high  frequencies  (it  takes a  lot of effort  to change  the current  through an  inductor at high 
frequencies) whereas  a  capacitor  has  a  high  reactance  at  low  frequencies  (it  “fills  up”  to 
have  a  large  potential  across  it).    The  sign  on  the  capacitive  reactance  is  a  convention,

APPARATUS 
 
1.  Science Workshop 750 Interface 
 
In  this  lab  we  will  again  use  the  Science  Workshop  750  interface  as  an  AC  function 
generator, whose  voltage we  can  set  and  current we  can measure.   We will  also  use  it  to 
measure the voltage across the capacitor using a voltage probe.  
 
2. AC/DC Electronics Lab Circuit Board 
We  will  also  again  use  the  circuit  board,  set  up  with  a  100  µF 
capacitor  in  series  with  the  coil  (which  serves  both  as  the 
resistor and inductor in the circuit), as pictured at left. 
 
 
Figure 5  Setup of the AC/DC Electronics Lab Circuit Board.   
In  addition, we will  connect  a voltage probe  in parallel with  the 
capacitor (not pictured). 
 
 
 
 
 
GENERALIZED PROCEDURE 
 
In  this  lab  you  will  measure  the  behavior  of  a  series  RLC  circuit,  both  when  driven 
sinusoidally by a function generator and when undriven. 
 
Part 1: Free Oscillations in an Undriven RLC Circuit 
The  capacitor  is  charged with  a DC battery which  is  then  turned off,  allowing  the  circuit 
to ring down. 
 
Part 2: Energy Ringdown in an Undriven RLC Circuit 
Part 1 is repeated, except that the energy is reported instead of current and voltage. 
 
Part 3: Driving the RLC Circuit on Resonance 
Now the circuit is driven with a sinusoidal voltage and you will adjust to frequency while 
monitoring plots of I(t) and V(t) as well as V vs. I. 
 
Part 4: What’s The Frequency? 
The  circuit  is  driven with  an  unknown  frequency  and  you must  determine  if  its  above  or 
below resonance. 
 
Part 5: What’s That Trace? 
Current  and  voltage  across  the  function  generator  and  capacitor  are  recorded,  but  you 
must determine which trace is which.
