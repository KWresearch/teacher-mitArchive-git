PRE-LAB READING 

INTRODUCTION 
 
Thus far  in class we have  talked about fields, both gravitational and electric, and how we 
can use them to understand how objects can interact at a distance.  A charge, for example, 
creates an electric  field around  it, which can  then exert a  force on a second charge which 
enters  that  field.    In  this  lab we will  study  another way  of  thinking  about  this  interaction 
through electric potentials. 
 
The Details:  Electric Potential (Voltage) 
 
Before  discussing  electric  potential,  it  is  useful  to  recall  the  more  intuitive  concept  of 
potential  energy,  in  particular  gravitational  potential  energy.    This  energy  is  associated 
with a mass’s position in a gravitational field (its height).  The potential energy difference 
between being at  two points  is defined as  the amount of work  that must be done  to move 
between  them.    This  then  sets  the  relationship  between  potential  energy  and  force  (and 
hence field): 
 
 
 
We  earlier  defined  fields  by  breaking  a  two  particle  interaction,  force,  into  two  single 
particle  interactions,  the  creation  of  a  field  and  the  “feeling”  of  that  field.    In  the  same 
way,  we  can  define  a  potential  which  is  created  by  a  particle  (gravitational  potential  is 
created  by  mass,  electric  potential  by  charge)  and  which  then  gives  to  other  particles  a 
potential energy.  So, we define electric potential, V, and given the potential can calculate 
the field: 
 
 
 
Noting  the  similarity between  (1)  and  (2)  and  recalling  that F = qE,  the potential  energy 
of a charge in this electric potential must be simply given by U = qV.

When  thinking about potential  it  is convenient  to  think of  it as “height” (for gravitational 
potential  in  a  uniform  field,  this  is  nearly  precise,  since  U  =  mgh  and  thus  the 
gravitational  potential  V  =  gh).    Electric  potential  is  measured  in  Volts,  and  the  word 
“voltage”  is often used  interchangeably with “potential.”   You are probably familiar with 
this  terminology  from batteries, which maintain  fixed potential differences between  their 
two ends (e.g. 9 V in 9 volt batteries, 1.5 V in AAA-D batteries). 
 
Equipotentials and Electric Fields 
 
When  trying  to  picture  a  potential  landscape,  a  map  of  equipotential  curves  –  curves 
along  which  the  potential  is  equal  –  can  be  very  helpful.    For  gravitational  potentials 
these maps are called topographic maps.  An example is shown in Fig. 1b. 
 
 
(a) 

(b) 

 
 
 
Figure  1:    Equipotentials.    A  potential  landscape  (pictured  in  3D  in  (a))  can  be 
represented  by  a  series  of  equipotential  lines  (b),  creating  a  topographic  map  of  the 
landscape.  The potential (“height”) is constant along each of the curves. 
 
Now  consider  the  relationship  between  equipotentials  and  fields.    At  any  point  in  the 
potential  landscape,  the  field  points  in  the  direction  that  a  mass  would  feel  a  force  if 
placed  there  (or  that  a  positive  charge  would  feel  a  force  for  electric  potentials  and 
fields).  So, place a ball at the top of the hill (near the center of the left set of circles in the 
topographic map  of  Fig.  1b).   Which way  does  it  roll?   Downhill!   But what  direction  is 
that?    Perpendicular  to  the  equipotential  lines.    Why?    Equipotential  lines  are  lines  of 
constant  height,  so  moving  along  them  at  all  does  not  achieve  the  objective  of  going 
downhill.    So  the  force  (and  hence  field)  must  point  across  them,  pushing  the  object 
downhill.  But why exactly perpendicular?  Work done on an object changes its potential, 
so  it  can  take  no  work  to  move  along  an  equipotential  line.    Work  is  given  by  the  dot 
product of force and displacement.  For this to be zero, the force must be perpendicular to 
the displacement, that is, force (and hence fields) must be perpendicular to equipotentials. 
 
Note:  Potential vs. Potential Difference 
 
Note that in equation (2) we only defined ∆V, the potential difference between two points, 
and not  the potential V.   This  is because potential  is  like height –  the  location we  choose 
to call “zero”  is completely arbitrary.   In  this  lab we will choose one  location  to call zero 
(the “ground”), and measure potentials relative to the potential at that location.

APPARATUS 
 
1.  Conducting Paper Landscapes 
 
To get a better feeling for what equipotential curves look like and how they are related to 
electric  field  lines,  we  will  measure  sets  of  equipotential  curves  for  several  different 
potential  landscapes.    These  landscapes  are  created  on  special  paper  (on  which  you  can 
measure  electric  potentials)  by  fixing  a  potential  difference  between  two  conducting 
shapes  on  the  paper.    For  reasons  that we will  discuss  later,  these  conducting  shapes  are 
themselves  equipotential  surfaces,  and  their  shape  and  relative  position  determines  the 
electric  field  and  potential  everywhere  in  the  landscape.    One  purpose  of  this  lab  is  to 
develop  an  intuition  for  how  this works.   There  are  four  landscapes  to  choose  from  (Fig. 
2), and you will measure equipotentials on two of them (one from Fig. 1a, b and one from 
Fig. 1c, d).

Figure  2 Conducting Paper Landscapes.   Each of  the  four  landscapes –  the “standard” 
(a)  dipole  and  (b)  parallel  plates,  and  the  “non-standard”  (c)  bent  plate  and  (d)  filled 
plates  –  consists  of  two  conductors  which  will  be  connected  to  the  positive  (red)  and 
ground (blue)  terminals of a battery.   In (d)  there  is an additional conductor which  is free 
to float  to whatever potential  is required.  The pads are painted on conducting paper with 
a 1 cm grid. 
 
2.  Science Workshop 750 Interface 
 
In  this  lab  we  will  use  the  Science  Workshop  750  interface  (Fig.  3)  both  to  create  the 
potential  landscapes  (using  the  “OUPUT”  connections  that  act  like  a  battery)  and  to 
measure  the  potential  at  various  locations  in  that  landscape  using  a  voltage  sensor  (see 
below).  There are two connections to the output, just like there are two sides of a battery.  

 

E01-3

The  one  marked  with  a  sin  wave  is  the  positive  terminal  and  the  one  marked  with  a 
triangle  (the  “ground  symbol”)  is  the negative  terminal.   The potential of  this  terminal  is 
what we will call zero.  We will set the potential difference between the two to 5 V.

3. Voltage Sensor 
 
In  order  to measure  the  potential  as  a  function  of  position  we  use  a  voltage  sensor  (Fig. 
4).     One side of  the sensor plugs  into Channel A on  the 750,  the other has  two  leads, red 
and  black.    When  the  750  records  the  “potential,”  it  really  measures  the  potential 
difference between the two leads, the potential at the red lead minus that at the black lead.

GENERALIZED PROCEDURE 
 
For  each  of  the  two  landscapes  that  you  choose,  you will  find  at  least  four  equipotential 
contours  by  searching  for  points  in  the  landscape  at  the  same  potential  using  the  voltage 
sensor.    After  recording  these  curves,  you  will  draw  several  electric  field  lines,  making 
use of the fact that they are everywhere perpendicular to equipotential contours.

Expt. 1: Equipotential Lines and Electric Fields Pre-Lab Questions 

 
Answer these questions on a separate sheet of paper and turn them in before the lab 
 
1.   Equipotentials Curves – Reading Topographic Maps 
 
Below is a topographic map of a 0.4 mi square region of San Francisco.  The contours 
shown are separated by heights of 25 feet (so from 375 feet to 175 feet above sea level 
for the region shown) 
 

From left to right, the NS streets shown 
are Buchanan, Laguna, Octavia, Gough 
and Franklin.  From top to bottom, the 
EW streets shown are Broadway, 
Pacific, Jackson, Washington, Clay 
(which stops on either side of the park) 
and Sacramento. 
 
(a)  In the part of town shown in the 
above map, which street(s) have the 
steepest runs?  Which have the most 
level sections?  How do you know? 
 
(b)  How steep is the steepest street at 
its steepest (what is its slope in ft/mi)? 

 
(c) Which would take more work (in the physics sense):  walking 3 blocks south from 
Laguna and Jackson or 1 block west from Clay and Franklin? 
 
2.   Equipotentials, Electric Fields and Charge 
 
One group did this lab and measured the 
equipotentials for a slightly different 
potential landscape then the ones you 
have been given (although still on a 1 cm 
grid) and using +10 V rather than +5V. 
 
Note that they went a little overboard and 
marked equipotential curves (the magenta 
circles) at V = 0.25 V, 0.5V and then 
from V = 1 V to V = 10 V in 1 V 
increments. 
 
They followed the convention that red 
was their positive electrode (V = +10 V) 
and blue was ground (V = 0 V). 

 

E01-5

 
(a)  Copy the above figure and sketch eight electric field lines on it (equally spaced 
around the inner conductor). 
 
(b) What, approximately, is the magnitude of the electric field at r = 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 
cm, where r is measured from the center of the inner conductor?  You should express the 
field in V/cm.  (HINT:  The field is the local slope (derivative) of the potential.  Also, if 
you choose to use a ruler realize that the above reproduction of this group’s results is not 
the same size as the original, where the grid size was 1 cm). 
 
(c)  What is the relationship between the density of the equipotential lines, the density of 
the electric field lines, and the strength of the electric field? 
 
(d)  Plot the field strength vs. 1/r2 for the three points from part (b).  If the field were 
created by a single point charge what shape should this sketch be?  Is it? 
 
(e)  Approximately how much charge was on the inner conductor when the group made 
their measurements?  Make sure you include the sign as well as the amplitude.  (HINT:  
Use the sketch of (d))

IN-LAB ACTIVITIES 
 
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
 
1.  Download  the  LabView  file  from  the  web  and  save  the  file  to  your  desktop  (right 
click on the link and choose “Save Target As”).  Start LabView by double clicking 
2.  Connect  cables  to  the  output  of  the  750  (red  to  the  sin wave marked  output,  black  to 
ground).  One member of the group will hold these wires to the two conductors while 
another maps out the equipotentials. 
3.  Connect the Voltage Sensor to Analog Channel A on the 750 Interface 
4.  Connect  the  black  lead  of  the  voltage  sensor  to  the  black  output  (the  ground).    You 
will use the red lead to measure the potential around your landscapes. 

 
 
MEASUREMENTS 
 
Part 1: “Standard” Configuration 
1.  Choose  one  of  the  two  “standard”  conducting  paper  landscapes  (the  dipole  or 
parallel plate configuration) 
2.  Use the voltage connectors to make contacts to the two conducting pads 
3.  Press  the  green  “Go”  button  above  the  graph  to  energize  the  battery  and  begin 
recording the potential of the red lead (relative to the black lead = ground). 
4.  Measure  the  potential  of  both  conducting  pads  to  confirm  that  they  are  properly 
connected  (one  should  be  at  +5  V,  the  other  at  0  V),  and  that  they  are  indeed 
equipotential objects (we will explain why next week). 
5.  Now,  try  to  find  some  location  on  the  paper  that  is  at  about  +1  V  (don’t  worry 
about being too precise).  Mark this point on the plot on the next page.  
 
Do NOT write on the conducting paper 
 
 
6.  Find  another  1  V  point,  about  1  cm  away.    Continue  until  you  have  closed  the 
curve or left the page.  Sketch and label this equipotential curve. 
7.  Repeat  this process  to  find equipotentials at 2 V, 3 V, and 4 V.   Work pretty  fast; 
it’s  more  important  to  think  about  what  these  lines  mean  than  it  is  to  draw  them 
perfectly.    Think  about  what  you  are  doing  –  are  there  symmetries  that  you  can 
exploit to make this task easier?

3.  To explore the concept of electrostatic shielding.  
 

 

PRE-LAB READING 

INTRODUCTION 
 
When  a  charged object  is placed near  a  conductor,  electric  fields  exert  forces on  the  free 
charge carriers  in  the conductor which cause  them  to move.   This process occurs rapidly, 
and  ends when  there  is no  longer  an  electric  field  inside  the  conductor  (Einside conductor=0). 
The surface of the conductor ends up with regions where there is an excess of one type of 
charge over  the other.   For example,  if a positive charge  is placed near a metal, electrons 
will move  to  the  surface nearest  the charge,  leaving a net positive charge on  the opposite 
surface1.    This  charge  distribution  is  called  an  induced  charge  distribution.  The  process 
of separating positive from negative charges on a conductor by  the presence of a charged 
object is called electrostatic induction. 
 
Michael  Faraday  used  a  metal  ice  pail  as  a  conducting  object  to  study  how  charges 
distributed  themselves  when  a  charged  object  was  brought  inside  the  pail.  Suppose  we 
lower a positively charged metal ball  into  the pail without  touching  it  to  the pail.   When 
we  do  this,  positive  charges  move  as  far  away  from  the  ball  as  possible  –  to  the  outer 
surface of  the pail,  leaving a net negative charge on  the  inner  surface.    If at  this point we 
provide  some  way  for  the  positive  charges  to  flow  away  from  the  pail,  for  example  by 
touching  our  hand  to  it,  they will  run  off  through  our  hand.  If we  then  remove  our  hand 
from  the  pail  and  then  remove  the  positively  charged metal  ball  from  inside  the  pail,  the 
pail will be left with a net negative charge.  This is called charging by induction.   
 
In  contrast,  if  we  touch  the  positively  charged  ball  to  the  uncharged  pail,  electrons  flow 
from  the  pail  into  the  ball,  trying  to  neutralize  the  positive  charge  on  it.  This  leaves  the 
pail with a net positive charge. This is called charging by contact.   
 
Finally,  when  a  positively  charged  ball  approaches  the  ice  pail  from  outside  of  the  pail, 
charges  will  redistribute  themselves  on  the  outside  surface  of  the  pail  and  will  exactly 
cancel the electric field inside the pail.  This is called electrostatic shielding.  

                                                 
1  We  will  typically  say  that  “positive  charge  flows  outward”  even  though  in  metals  it’s  really  electrons 
moving inward.  This is a completely equivalent way of thinking about it for our purposes. 

 

E02-1

You  will  investigate  all  three  of  these  phenomena—charging  by  induction,  charging  by 
contact, and electrostatic shielding—in this experiment.   
 
The Details:  Gauss’s Law 
 
In the above situations, the excess charge on the conductor resides entirely on the surface, 
a  fact  that  may  be  explained  by  Gauss’s  Law.  Gauss’s  Law2  states  that  the  electric  flux 
through any closed surface is proportional to the charge enclosed inside that surface,

Consider a mathematical, closed Gaussian surface that is inside the ice pail: 

 

 
Figure 1  Top View of Gaussian surface for the Faraday Ice Pail (a thick walled cylinder) 
 
Once  static  equilibrium  has  been  reached,  the  electric  field  inside  the  conducting  metal 
walls  of  the  ice  pail  is  zero.   Since  the Gaussian  surface  is  in  a  conducting  region where 
there  is  zero  electric  field,  the  electric  flux  through  the  Gaussian  surface  is  zero. 
Therefore, by Gauss’s Law,  the net charge  inside  the Gaussian  surface must be zero. For 
the Faraday ice pail, the positively charged ball is inside the Gaussian surface. Therefore, 
there  must  be  an  additional  induced  negative  charge  on  the  inner  surface  of  the  ice  pail 
that exactly cancels the positive charge on the ball.   It must reside on the surface because 
we could make the same argument with any Gaussian surface, including one which is just 
barely  outside  the  inner  surface.    Since  the  pail  is  uncharged,  by  charge  conservation 
there must be a positive  induced charge on  the pail which has  the  same magnitude as  the 
negative  induced  charge.  This  positive  charge  must  reside  outside  the  Gaussian  surface, 
hence on the outer surface of the ice pail. 
 
Note  that  the  electric  field  in  the  hollow  region  inside  the  ice  pail  is  not  zero  due  to  the 
presence  of  the  charged  ball,  and  that  the  electric  field  outside  the  pail  is  also  not  zero, 
due to the positive charge on its outer surface. 
                                                 
2   For more details on Gauss’s Law, see Chapter 4 of the Course Note, Section 4.3 for info on conductors. 

 

E02-2

Now suppose the ice pail is connected to a large conducting object (“ground”):  
 

 

 
Figure 2 Grounding the ice pail (left) and after removing the ground & ball (right) 
 
Now  the  positive  charges  that  had  moved  to  the  surface  of  the  ice  pail  can  get  even 
further away from the positively charged metal ball by flowing into the ground.  Now that 
there  are  no  charges  on  the  outer  surface  of  the  pail,  the  electric  field  outside  the  pail  is 
zero  and  the  pail  is  at  the  same  “zero”  potential  as  the  ground  (and  infinity).    If  the wire 
to ground is then disconnected, the pail will be left with an overall negative charge. Once 
the  positively  charged  ball  is  removed,  this  negative  charge  will  redistribute  itself  over 
the outer surface of the pail. 
 
Finally, when a charged ball approaches the ice pail from outside of the pail, charges will 
redistribute themselves on the outside surface of the pail while the electric field inside the 
pail  will  remain  zero,  cut-off  from  any  knowledge  of  what  is  going  on  outside  by  the 
enforced  zero  electric  field  inside  the  conductor.  This  effect  is  called  shielding  or 
“screening”  and  explains  popular  science  demonstrations  in  which  a  person  sits  safely 
inside a cage while an enormous voltage is applied to the cage. This same effect explains 
why  metal  boxes  are  used  to  screen  out  undesirable  electric  fields  from  sensitive 
equipment. 
 
APPARATUS 
 
1. Ice Pail 
 
Our  primary  apparatus  consists  of  two  concentric 
wire-mesh  cylinders.  The  inner  cylinder  (the  “pail”) 
is  electrically  isolated  by  three  insulating  rods.  The 
outer  cylinder  (the  “shield”)  will  be  attached  to 
ground  –  charge  can  flow  to  or  from  it  as  necessary.  
This  cylinder  will  act  both  as  a  screen  to  eliminate 
the  effect  of  any  external  charges  and  other  external 
fields  and  as  a  “zero  potential”  point,  relative  to 
which you will measure the potential of the pail.

2. Charge Producers 
 
To replace the positively charged metal ball of Faraday’s experiment, you will use charge 
producers  (Figure  4).    When  rubbed  together  a  net  positive  charge  will  move  to  one  of 
them and a net negative charge to the other.  
 

Charged pad

3. Charge Sensor 
 
The  Charge  Sensor  does  not  directly  measure  charge,  but  instead  measures  the  voltage  
difference between its positive (red) and negative (black) leads.  Furthermore, it connects 
the black lead to ground, meaning that as much charge can flow into or out of that lead as 
is necessary to keep it at “zero potential” (ideally the same voltage as at infinity).   
 

 

 
Figure  5  Charge  Sensor  –  measures  voltage  difference  between  its  red  and  black  leads.  
Left:  Shown attached to the lead assembly.  Right: The gain switch (used to amplify 
small signals) should be set at 1.  The zero button sets the output signal to zero. 
 
The  red  lead  is  free  to  be  at  any  potential,  although  by  pushing  the  “zero”  button  on  the 
sensor  (Fig.  5,  right),  it  too  can  be  attached  to  ground  (the  potential  difference  between 
the red and black leads is set to zero). 
 
Even though this is really a potential difference sensor, we none-the-less call it a “Charge 
Sensor” because the voltages measured arise from the presence of charges on the ice pail, 
as you will calculate in Pre-Lab problem 1.

In  this  lab  we  will  for  the  first  time  use  the  Science  Workshop  750  interface  (Fig.  6).  
This  allows  signal  measurements  (in  this  lab,  from  the  charge  sensor)  to  be  sent  to  the 
computer where they can be recorded and plotted.

GENERALIZED PROCEDURE 
 
This  lab  consists  of  four  main  parts.    In  each  you  will  measure  the  voltage  between  the 
inner and outer cylinder to determine what is happening on the inner cylinder. 
 
Part 1: Determine Polarity of (Sign of Charge on) Charge Producers 
Here  you  will  lower  the  charge  producers  into  the  center  of  the  pail  (the  inner  cylinder) 
and determine which producer is positively charged and which is negatively charged 
 
Part 2: Charging by Contact 
You will  now  rub  the  charge  producer  against  the  inner  surface  of  the  pail  and  see  if  the 
charge is transferred to it. 
 
Part 3: Charging by Induction 
In  this  part  you  will  not  let  the  charge  producer  touch  the  pail,  but  will  instead  briefly 
ground  the  pail  by  connecting  it  to  the  shield  (the  outer  cylinder)  while  the  charge 
producer  is  inside.    Then  you  will  remove  the  charge  producer  and  observe  the  induced 
charge on the pail. 
 
Part 4:  Electrostatic Shielding 
In  this  part  you  will  measure  the  effects  of  placing  a  charge  producer  outside  of  the 
grounded shield.

Experiment 2: Faraday Ice Pail Pre-Lab Questions 

 
Answer these questions on a separate sheet of paper and turn them in before the lab 
 
1.   Capacitance of our Experimental Set-Up 
 
In this experiment we will measure the potential difference between the pail and the 
shield, and make statements about the charge on the pail based on this.  Here you will 
calculate the relationship between charge and potential. 
 
Consider two nested cylindrical conductors of height h and radii a & b respectively.  A 
charge +Q is evenly distributed on the outer surface of the pail (the inner cylinder), -Q on 
the inner surface of the shield (the outer cylinder). 
 

        

       
 
 
(a)  Calculate the electric field between the two cylinders (a < r < b). 
 
(b)  Calculate the potential difference between the two cylinders: 
∆V = V(a) – V(b) 

 

 
(c)  Calculate the capacitance of this system, C = Q/∆V 
 
(d)  Numerically evaluate the capacitance for your experimental setup, given: 
h  ≅ 15 cm, a ≅ 4.75 cm and b ≅ 7.25 cm 

 
The capacitance should be given in Farads (1 F = 1 Coulomb/Volt) or some fraction 
thereof (mF, µF, …)  Write this number in your notes, as you will use it to 
convert from the measured voltage difference ∆V to a charge on the outer surface of the 
pail (inner cylinder) Q, using Q = C ∆V 
 

 

E02-7

2.  What about charge on other surface? 
 
In  the  previous  problem we  assumed  that  charge was  located  on  the  outer  surface  of  the 
inner  cylinder  and  the  inner  surface  of  the  outer  one,  in  other  words,  if  both  cylinders 
were  charged.    What  if  instead  the  cylinders  were  both  neutral  but  exhibited  charge 
separation  due  to  the  presence  of  a  positive  charge  Q  sitting  in  the  interior  of  the  inner 
cylinder?  What now is the potential difference between the two cylinders? 
 
For the next three questions you are asked to sketch potential difference versus time 
as you move charges  into or around  the system.   You should mark the given actions 
on  the  time  axis  (assume  they  are  each  done  very  quickly  but  with  some  time  in 
between)  and  indicate what  happens  to  the  potential  difference when  each  action  is 
made.    In  each  case  the  potential  difference  should  start  at  zero  volts.    NOTE:    Of 
course  you  can’t  give  any  numbers,  we  just  want  you  to  indicate  if  the  potential 
increases or decreases or goes to zero or back to some previous value. 
 
3.  Prediction:  Charging by Contact 
 
Sketch your prediction for the graph of potential difference vs. time for part 2 of this 
experiment.  Indicate the following events on the time axis: 
Insert positive charge producer into pail 
(a) 
 
Rub charge producer against inner surface of pail 
(b) 
 
 
(c)  
Remove charge producer 
 
4.  Prediction:  Charging by Induction 
 
Sketch your prediction for the graph of potential difference vs. time for part 3 of this 
experiment.  Indicate the following events on the time axis: 
Insert positive charge producer into pail 
(a) 
 
 
(b) 
Ground pail to shield 
Remove ground contact between pail and shield 
(c) 
 
 
(d)  
Remove charge producer 
 
5.  Prediction:  Electrostatic Shielding 
 
Sketch your prediction for the graph of potential difference vs. time for part 4 of this 
experiment.  Indicate the following events on the time axis: 
(a) 
 
Bring positive charge producer near (but outside of) shield 
 
(b)  Move charge producer away

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
1.  Download  the  LabView  file  from  the  web  and  save  the  file  to  your  desktop  (right 
click on  the  link  and  choose  “Save Target As”  to  the desktop.   Overwrite  any  file by 
this name that is already there).  Start LabView by double clicking on this file. 
2.  Using  the  multi-pin  cable,  connect  the  Charge  Sensor  to  Analog  Channel  A  on  the 
750 Interface.  The cable runs from the left end of the sensor (in Fig. 5) to Channel A. 
3.  Connect  the  lead  assembly  to  the  BNC  port  on  the  Charge  Sensor  (right  end  of  the 
sensor  in  Fig.  5).    Line  up  the  connector  on  the  end  of  the  cable  with  the  pin  on  the 
BNC port.   Push  the connector onto  the port and  twist  it clockwise about one-quarter 
turn until it clicks into place.   Set the Charge Sensor gain to 1x.   
4.  Connect  the  charge  sensor  input  lead  (red  alligator  clip)  to  the  pail  (the  inner  wire 
mesh cylinder), and  the ground  lead (black alligator clip)  to  the shield (the outer wire 
mesh cylinder).  

 
MEASUREMENTS 
Important Notes: 
The charge producers are delicate.  When rubbing them together do so briskly but gently. 
Each  experiment  should  begin  with  completely  discharged  cylinders.    To  discharge  
them,  ground  the  pail  by  touching  both  it  and  the  shield  at  the  same  time  with  a 
conductor (e.g. the finger of one hand).  You also will always want to zero the charge 
sensor before starting by pressing the “Zero” button.

1.  Ground the pail and zero the charge sensor 
2.  Start recording data. (Press the green “Go” button above the graph). 
3.  Rub the blue and white surfaces of the charge producers together several times.

reasoning. Will an  induced charge distribution appear on  the  shield?   Are we  sensitive  to 
this?  What about the blue charge producer?  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Further Questions (for experiment, thought, future exam questions…) 
 
•  What happens if we repeat the above measurements with the ground (black clip) 
attached to the pail and the red clip attached to the shield?  Does anything change 
aside from the sign of the voltage difference? 
•  What happens if in part 2 we touch the charge producer to the outside of the pail 
rather than the inside? 
•  What happens if we place the charge producer between the pail & shield rather than 
inside the pail? 
•  What happens if we put both the white & blue charge producers inside the pail 
together (not touching, just both inside).  Is the cancellation exact?  Should it be? 
•  What if in part 2 we touch the white producer and then the blue producer to the pail?  
What if we touch the white producer, then recharge it and touch again?  Doing this 
repeatedly, is there a difference between touching the inside of the pail and the 
outside of the pail?

Experiment 3: Magnetic Fields of a Bar Magnet and Helmholtz Coil 

 
OBJECTIVES  
 
1.  To learn how to visualize magnetic field lines using compasses and a gauss meter 
2.  To examine the field lines from bar magnets and see how they add 
3.  To  examine  the  field  lines  from  a  Helmholtz  coil  and  understand  the  difference 
between using it in Helmholtz and anti-Helmholtz configurations. 
 

 

PRE-LAB READING 

INTRODUCTION 
 
In  this  lab  we  will  measure  magnetic  field  lines  using  two  methods.    First,  we  will  use 
small  compasses  that  show  the  direction,  but  not magnitude,  of  the  local magnetic  field.  
Next  we  will  use  a  gauss  meter,  which  measures  the  magnitude  of  the  magnetic  field 
along  a  single,  specific  axis  and  thus  does  not  allow  as  easy  a  visualization  of  the 
magnetic  field  direction.    We  will  measure  fields  both  from  bar  magnets  and  from  a 
Helmholtz coil. 
 
APPARATUS 
 
1.  Mini-Compass 
You  will  receive  a  bag  of  mini-compasses  (Fig.  1a)  that  indicate  the  magnetic  field 
direction  by  aligning  with  it,  with  the  painted  end  of  the  compass  needle  pointing  away 
from magnetic  north  (i.e.  pointing  in  the  direction  of  the magnetic  field).   Conveniently, 
the  magnetic  south  pole  of  the  Earth  is  very  close  to  its  geographic  north  pole,  so 
compasses  tend  to  point  North  (Fig.  1b).    Note  that  these  compasses  are  cheap  (though 
not  necessary  inexpensive)  and  sometimes  either  point  in  the  direction  opposite  the way 
they should, or get completely stuck.  Check them out before using them.

end of the compass points north because it points towards magnetic south. 

 

 

 

 

E03-1

2.  Science Workshop 750 Interface 
 
As  always,  we  will  use  the  Science Workshop  750  interface,  this  time  for  recording  the 
magnetic field magnitude as measured by the magnetic field sensor (gauss meter). 
 
3. Magnetic Field Sensor 
The magnetic field sensor measures the strength of the magnetic field pointing into one of 
two  white  dots  painted  at  its  measurement  end  (far  left  in  Fig.  2).    Selecting  “radial” 
mode  records  the  strength  of  the  field  pointing  into  the  dot  on  the  side  of  the  device, 
while  “axial”  records  the  strength  of  the  field  pointing  into  the  dot  on  the  end.    There  is 
also a tare button which sets the current field strength to zero (i.e. measures relative to it). 

 
Figure  2 Magnetic  field  sensor, showing (from right  to  left)  the range select switch,  the 
tare button, and the radial/axial switch, which is set to radial. 
 
4. Helmholtz Coil 
 
Consider  the Helmholtz Coil Apparatus  shown  in Fig. 3.    It  consists of  two  coaxial  coils 
separated  by  a  distance  equal  to  their  common  radii.    The  coil  can  be  operated  in  3 
modes.    In  the  first,  connections  are  made  only  to  one  set  of  banana  plugs,  pushing 
current  through  only  one  of  the  coils.    In  the  second,  a  connection  is  made  between  the 
black  plug  from  one  coil  to  the  red  plug  from  the  other.    This  sends  current  the  same 
direction  through  both  coils  and  is  called  “Helmholtz Mode.”    In  the  final  configuration 
“Anti-Helmholtz  Mode”  a  connection  is  made  between  the  two  black  plugs,  sending 
current in the opposite direction through the two coils. 

Figure 3 Helmholtz Coil Apparatus 

 

 

E03-2

4. Power Supply 
 
Because  the Helmholtz coils  require a  fairly  large current  in order  to create a measurable 
field, we  are  unable  to  use  the  output  of  the  750  to  drive  them.    For  this  reason, we will 
use an EZ dc power supply (Fig. 4).  This supply limits both the voltage  and the current, 
putting out the largest voltage possible consistent with both settings.  That is, if the output 
is  open  (no  leads  connected,  so  no  current)  then  the  voltage  output  is  completely 
determined  by  the  voltage  setting.    On  the  other  hand,  if  the  output  is  shorted  (a  wire  is 
placed  between  the  two  output  plugs)  then  the  voltage  is  completely  determined  by  the 
current setting (V = IRshort). 
 

 

 

E03-3

Figure 4 Power Supply for Helmholtz Coil 
The  power  supply  allows  independent  control 
of  current  (left  knob)  and  voltage  (right  knob) 
with  whichever  limits  the  output  the  most  in 
control.    The  green  light  next  to  the  “CV”  in 
this  picture  means  that  we  are  in  “constant 
voltage” mode –  the voltage  setting  is  limiting 
the  output  (which  makes  sense  since  the 
output  at  the  bottom  right  is  not  hooked  up  so 
there is currently no current flow). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

GENERALIZED PROCEDURE 
 
This  lab  consists  of  three  main  parts.    In  each  you  will  measure  the  magnetic  field 
generated either by bar magnets or by current carrying coils. 
 
Part 1: Mapping Magnetic Field Lines Using Mini-Compasses 
Using a compass you will follow a series of field lines originating near the north pole of a 
bar magnet. 
 
Part 2: Constructing a Magnetic Field Diagram 
A  pair  of  bar  magnets  are  placed  so  that  either  their  opposite  poles  or  same  poles  are 
facing each other and you will map out the field lines from these configurations. 
 
Part 3: Helmholtz Coil 
In  this  part  you  will  use  the  magnetic  field  sensor  to  measure  the  amplitude  of  the 
magnetic field generated from three different geometries of current carrying wire loops.

Experiment 3: Magnetic Fields Pre-Lab Questions 

 
Answer these questions on a separate sheet of paper and turn them in before the lab 
 
1.   Superposition 

 
Consider two bar magnets placed at right 
angles to each other, as pictured at left.   
 
(a)    If  a  small  compass  is  placed  at  point  P, 
what  direction  does  the  painted  end  of  the 
compass needle point? 
 
(b)    If  the  compass  needle  instead  pointed  15 
degrees  clockwise  of  where  you  predicted  in 
(a),  what  could  you  qualitatively  conclude 
about the relative strengths of the two magnets?

As  pictured  at  left,  a  Helmholtz  coil  is  created  by  placing  two 
such coils (each of radius R and N turns) a distance R apart. 
 
(a)    If  the  current  in  the  two  coils  is  parallel  (Helmholtz 
configuration),  what  is  the  axial  field  strength  at  the  center  of 
the apparatus  (midway between  the  two coils)?   How does  this 
compare  to  the  field  strength  at  the  center  of  the  single  coil 
configuration (e.g. what is the ratio)? 

 
(b)  In  the anti-Helmholtz configuration  the current  in  the  two coils  is anti-parallel.   What 
is field strength at the center of the apparatus in this situation? 
 
(c) Our coils have a radius R = 7 cm and N = 168 turns, and we will run with I = 0.6 A in  
single  coil  and  0.3 A  in Helmholtz  and  anti-Helmholtz mode.   What,  approximately,  are 
the  largest  on-axis  fields  we  should  expect  in  these  three  configurations?    Where 
(approximately)  are  the  fields  the  strongest?    Write  the  answer  to  this 
question in your notes.  You will need it for the lab.

IN-LAB ACTIVITIES 
 
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
 
1.  Download the LabView file and start up the program. 
2.  Connect the Magnetic Field Sensor to Analog Channel A on the 750 Interface 
3.  Without  leads  connected  to  the power  supply,  turn  it on  and  set  the voltage output  to 
2 V.  Turn it off. 
NOTE:  When  working  with  bar  magnets,  please  do  NOT  force  a  north  pole  to  touch  a 
north pole (or force south poles to touch), as this will demagnetize the magnets. 

 
MEASUREMENTS 
Part 1: Mapping Magnetic Field Lines Using Mini-Compasses 
1.  Tape a piece of brown paper (provided) onto your table. 
2.  Place a bar magnet about 3 inches from the far side of the paper, as shown below. 
Trace the outline of the magnet on the paper. 

(cid:55)  3 inches, more or less 

Table edge 

 
3.  Place a compass near one end of  the magnet.   Make  two dots on  the paper, one at 
the end of  the compass needle next  to  the magnet and  the  second at  the other end 
of  the compass needle.   Now move  the compass so  that  the end of  the needle  that 
was next  to  the magnet  is directly over  the second dot, and make a new dot at  the 
other  end  of  the  needle.    Continue  this  process  until  the  compass  comes  back  to 
the  magnet  or  leaves  the  edge  of  the  paper.    Draw  a  line  through  the  dots  and 
indicate  with  an  arrowhead  the  direction  in  which  the  North  end  of  the  needle 
pointed, as shown below   

 

 

 

E03-6

4.  Repeat the process described above several more times (~4 field lines), starting at 
different  locations  on  the  magnet.   Work  fairly  quickly  –  it  is  more  important  to 
get a feeling for the shape of the field lines than to map them precisely. 

 
Question 1: 
Mostly  your  field  lines  come  back  to  the  bar  magnet,  but  some  of  them  wander  off  and 
never  come  back  to  the  bar  magnet.    Which  part  of  your  bar  magnet  do  the  ones  that 
wander off never to return come from?  Where are they going? 
 
 
 
 
Part 2: Constructing a Magnetic Field Diagram 
2A: Parallel Magnets 
1.  Arrange two bar magnets and a series of compasses as pictured here: 

 
2.  Sketch  the  compass  needles’  directions  in  the  diagram.  Based  on  these  compass 
directions, sketch in some field lines.   

 
Question 2: 
Is there any place in this region where the magnetic field is zero?  If so, where?  How can 
you tell? 
 
 

 

E03-7

Question 3: 
Where  is  the magnetic  field  the  strongest  in  this  situation?   How  can  you  determine  this 
from the field lines? 
 
 
 
 
 
2B: Anti-Parallel Magnets 
1.  Arrange two bar magnets and a series of compasses as pictured here: 

 
2.  Sketch  the  compass  needles’  directions  in  the  diagram.  Based  on  these  compass 
directions, sketch in some field lines.   

 
Question 4: 
Is there any place in this region where the magnetic field is zero?  If so, where?  How can 
you tell? 
 
 
 
 

 

E03-8

Part 3: Helmholtz Coil 
In this part we are going to measure the z-component of the field along the z-axis (central 
axis of the coils) 
3A: Using a Single Coil 
1.  With  the power supply off, connect  the  red  lead  from  the power supply  to  the  red 
plug of  the  top coil, and  the black  lead  to  the black plug of  the  top coil.   Turn  the 
current  knob  fully  counter-clockwise  (i.e.  turn  off  the  current)  then  turn  on  the 
power supply and slowly turn the current up to ~ 0.6 A. 
2.  Put  the magnetic  field  sensor  in  axial mode,  set  its gain  to 10x  and place  it  along 
the central axis of the Helmholtz coil, pushing into the indentation at the center of 
the holder.  Tare it to set the reading to zero. 
3.  Start  recording  magnetic  field  (press  Go)  and  raise  the  magnetic  field  sensor 
smoothly along the z-axis until you are above the top coil.  Try raising at different 
rates  to  convince  yourself  that  this  only  changes  the  time  axis,  and  not  the 
measured magnitude of the field.

from  the  black  terminal  of  the  upper  to  the  red  terminal  of  the  lower,  sending 
current in the same direction through both coils.  Set the current to ~ 0.3 A 
2.  Follow  the  procedure  in  3A  to  again  measure  field  strength  along  the  z-axis,

Where  along  the  axis  is  the  field  from  the  strongest?    What  is  its  magnitude  at  this 
location?  How does this compare to your pre-lab prediction.  Aside from the location and 
strength of  the maximum,  is  there a qualitative difference between  the single coil and  the 
Helmholtz coil field profile?  If so, what is the difference? 
 
 
 
 
 
3C: Anti-Helmholtz Configuration 
1.  Swap  the  leads  to  the  lower  coil,  keeping  the  current  at  ~  0.3  A,  although  now 
running in opposite directions in the top and bottom coil. 
2.  Follow the procedure in 3A to again measure field strength along the z-axis.

Question 7: 
What are  two main differences between  the  field profile  in Anti-Helmholtz configuration 
and in Helmholtz configuration?  Does the maximum field strength match your prediction 
from the pre-lab? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Further Questions (for experiment, thought, future exam questions…) 
 
•  What does the field profile look like if we place two bar magnets next to each other 
rather than collinear with each other (either parallel or anti-parallel to each other). 
•  What does the radial field profile (e.g. the x component of the field) look like along 
the z-axis of the Helmholtz coil? 
•  What do the radial and axial field profiles look like moving across the top of the 
Helmholtz coil rather than down its central axis? 
It looks as though there is a local maximum of magnetic field strength at some point 
on the axis for both the single coil and Helmholtz coil configurations (at least looking 
at them along the z-axis only).  If we consider them three dimensionally are they still 
local maxima?  That is, if we move off axis does the magnitude of the field also 
decrease as we move away from these maxima points?

Experiment 4: Forces and Torques on Magnetic Dipoles 

 
OBJECTIVES  
 
1.  To  observe  and  measure  the  forces  and  torques  acting  on  a  magnetic  dipole 
placed in an external magnetic field.

INTRODUCTION 
 
In this lab you will suspend a magnetic dipole (a small but strong bar magnet) in the field 
of a Helmholtz coil (the same apparatus you used in Expt. 4).  You will observe the force 
and torque on the dipole as a function of position, and hence external field. 
 
The Details:  Magnetic Dipoles in External Fields 
 
As we have discussed in class, magnetic dipoles are characterized by their dipole moment 
µ, a vector that points in the direction of the B field generated by the dipole (at the center 
of the dipole).  When placed in an external magnetic field B, they have a potential energy 
(cid:71)(cid:71)
⋅µ B
DipoleU
 -
 
=
That is, they are at their lowest energy (“happiest”) when aligned with a large external 
field 
 
Torque 
 
When  in  a  non-zero  external  field  the  dipole  will  want  to  rotate  to  align  with  it.    The 
magnitude of the torque which leads to this rotation is easily calculated:

Again,  the direction of  the  torque  is such  that  the dipole moment rotates  to align with  the 
field  (perpendicular  to  the  plane  in  which µ  and  B  lie,  and  obeying  the  right  hand  rule 
that if your thumb points in the direction of the torque, your fingers rotate from µ to B. 
 
Force 
 
In  order  to  feel  a  force,  the  potential  energy  of  the  dipole must  change with  a  change  in 
its  position.    If  the magnetic  field B  is  constant,  then  this will not happen,  and hence  the 
dipole  feels  no  force  in  a  uniform  field.   However,  if  the  field  is  non-uniform,  such  as  is 
created  by  another  dipole,  then  there  can  be  a  force.    In  general,  the  force  is  quite 
complex, but for a couple of special cases it is simple: 

 

E04-1

1)  If the dipole is aligned with the external field it seeks higher field 
2)  If the dipole is anti-aligned it seeks lower field 

 
 
 
These  rules  can be  easily  remembered  just by  remembering  that  the dipole  always wants 
to  reduce  its  potential  energy.    They  can  also  be  remembered  by  thinking  about  the way 
that the poles of bar magnets interact – opposites attract while likes repel. 
 
In  one  dimension,  when  the  dipole  is  aligned  with  the  field,  a  rather  straight  forward 
mathematical expression may also be derived:

dU

Here it is important to note that the magnitude of the force depends not on the field but on 
the  derivative  of  the  field.    Aligned  dipoles  climb  uphill.    The  steeper  the  hill,  the more 
force they feel.

Figure 1 The Teach Spin Apparatus (a) The Helmholtz apparatus has a tower assembly 
(b) placed along its central axis.  The tower contains a disk magnet which is free to rotate 
(on a gimbal) about an axis perpendicular  to  the  tube and constrained  to move vertically.  
The  amount  of motion  can  be  converted  into  a  force  knowing  the  spring  constant  of  the 
spring. 

 

 

E04-2

The  central  piece  of  equipment  used  in  this  lab  is  the  Teach  Spin  apparatus  (Fig.  1).    It 
consists of  the Helmholtz coil  that you used  in experiment 3, along with a Plexiglas  tube 
containing  a  magnet  on  a  spring.    The  magnet  can  both  rotate  and  move  vertically, 
allowing you to visualize both torques and the forces on dipoles. 
 
It will be useful to recall some results from experiment 3 involving the Helmholtz coil.  
There are three different modes of operation – you can energize just a single coil, both 
coils in parallel (Helmholtz configuration) or both coils anti-parallel (anti-Helmholtz).  
The field profiles (as well as the derivatives of those profiles – necessary for thinking 
about force) look like the following:

2. Power Supply 
 
We will also use the same power supply as in experiment 4 in order to create large 
enough fields in the Helmholtz apparatus to exert a measurable force on the magnet. 
 
 
GENERALIZED PROCEDURE 
 
This lab consists of five main parts.  In each you will observe the effects (torque & force) 
of different magnetic field configurations on the disk magnet (a dipole). 
 
Part 1: Dipole at center of Helmholtz Coil 
You  will  move  the  disk  magnet  to  the  center  of  the  Helmholtz  apparatus  and  randomly 
align it and then see what happens when the coil is energized. 
 
Part 2: Reversing the field 
You will reverse the direction of the field and see what happens. 
 
Part 3: Moving Through the Helmholtz Apparatus 
Here you slowly pull  the disk magnet up  from  the bottom of  the Helmholtz apparatus  (in 
Helmholtz mode) and out through the top, observing any torques or forces on the magnet. 
 
Part 4: Dipole at center of Anti-Helmholtz Coil 
Here you repeat part 1 in anti-Helmholtz configuration 
 
Part 5: Moving Through the Anti-Helmholtz Apparatus 
Here you slowly pull  the disk magnet up  from  the bottom of  the Helmholtz apparatus  (in 
anti-Helmholtz  mode)  and  out  through  the  top,  observing  any  torques  or  forces  on  the 
magnet.

In  this  lab  we  will  have  a  disk  magnet  (a  dipole) 
suspended on  a  spring, which we will use  to observe 
forces  on  dipoles  due  to  different  magnetic  field 
configurations. 
 
(a)  Assuming  we  energize  only  the  top  coil  (current 
running  counter-clockwise  in  the  coil,  creating  the 
field  quoted  above),  and  assuming  that  the  dipole  is 
always  well  aligned  with  the  field  and  on  axis,  what 
is  the  force  on  the  dipole  as  a  function  of  position?

µ=
 
(b)  The  disk  magnet  (together  with  its  support)  has 
mass  m,  the  spring  has  spring  constant  k  and  the 
magnet has magnetic moment µ. With the current on, 
we  lift  the brass  rod until  the disk magnet  is  sitting  a 
distance z0 above the top of the coil.  Now the current 
is  turned  off.    How  does  the  magnet  move  once  the 
field is off (give both direction and distance)? 
 
(c)  At  what  height(s)  is  the  force  on  the  dipole  the 
largest? 
 
(d)  What is the force where the field is the largest? 
 
(e)  Our  coils  have  a  radius  R  =  7  cm  and  N  =  168 
turns, and  the experiment  is done with  I = 1 A  in  the 
coil.    The  spring  constant  k  ~  1  N/m,  and µ  ~  0.5  A 
m2.   The mass m ~ 5 g  is  in  the shape of a cylinder ~ 
0.5  cm  in diameter  and ~ 1  cm  long.    If we place  the 
magnet  at  the  location  where  the  spring  is  stretched 
the furthest when the field is on, at about what height 
will the magnet sit after the field is turned off? 

 

E04-5

2.  Motion of a Dipole in a Helmholtz Field 
 
In  Part  I  of  this  experiment  we  will  place  the  disk  magnet  (a 
dipole  with  moment  µ)  at  the  center  of  the  Helmholtz 
Apparatus  (in  Helmholtz  mode).    We  will  start  with  the  disk 
magnet  aligned  along  the  x-axis  (perpendicular  to  the  central 
z-axis  of  the  coils),  and  then  energize  the  coils with  a  current 
of 1 A. 

R 

R 

 
Recall  that a Helmholtz coil consists of  two coils of  radius R and N  turns each, separated 
by  a distance R,  as pictured  above.   The  field  from each coil  is given at  the beginning of 
the previous problem. 
 
(a)  Will the disk magnet experience a torque, a force or both? 
 
(b)  If the magnet experiences a torque: 
Approximately  how much  time will  it  take  for  the magnet  to  rotate  90º,  so  that  it 
is  aligned  with  the  external  field?    Give  your  answer  first  in  terms  of  an 
approximate  expression  using  R,  N,  I,  and  µ,  and  then  numerically,  using  the 
values given in problem 1e above. 

 
(c)  If the magnet experiences a force: 
Approximately  how  much  time  will  it  take  for  the  magnet  to  move  to  its  new 
equilibrium  position?    Give  your  answer  first  in  terms  of  an  approximate 
expression using R, N,  I, k and µ, and  then numerically, using  the values given  in 
problem 1e above. 

 
Record  the  answers  to  this  question  in  your  notes  as  you  will  be 
asked to compare them to what you observe in the lab.

direction (flip the current direction). 
2.  Carefully watch the dipole as you do this.  Repeat the experiment several times. 

 
Question 3:

this? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Further Questions (for experiment, thought, future exam questions…) 
 
•  What happens as we move through with just a single coil energized?  Is it similar to 
the Helmholtz or anti-Helmholtz?  How is it different? 
•  Are there places where we can put the disk magnet and then randomly orient it 
without either changing the force on it or having a torque rotate it back to alignment 
(in any of the 3 field configurations)? 
If you were to align the disk magnet with the x-axis (perpendicular the coil axis) and 
then center it in anti-Helmholtz mode, would there be a torque or force on it?

Experiment 5: Faraday’s Law 

 
OBJECTIVES  
 
1.  To  become  familiar  with  the  concepts  of  changing  magnetic  flux  and  induced 
current associated with Faraday’s Law of Induction. 

2.  To  see  how  and why  the  direction  of  the magnetic  force  on  a  conductor  carrying 
an  induced  current  is  consistent  with  Lenz’s  Law.    Lenz’s  Law  says  that  the 
system always responds so as to try to keep things the same.

PRE-LAB READING 

 

INTRODUCTION 
 
In  this  lab  you  will  develop  an  intuition  for  Faraday’s  and  Lenz’s  Laws.    By  moving  a 
coil of wire over a magnet you will change the magnetic flux through the coil, generating 
and EMF and hence current in the loop which you will measure using the 750. 
 
The Details:  Faraday’s Law 
 
Faraday’s  Law  states  that  a  changing  magnetic  flux  generates  an  EMF  (electromotive 
force).  Mathematically:

In  each  of  the  cases  pictured  above,  the  magnetic  flux  into  the  page  is  decreasing  with 
time  (because  the  (1)  B  field,  (2)  loop  area  or  (3)  projected  area  are  decreasing  with 
time).    This  decreasing  flux  creates  an  EMF.    In  which  direction?    We  can  use  Lenz’s 
Law to find out. 
 
Lenz’s Law 
Lenz’s Law  is a non-mathematical statement of Faraday’s Law.    It says  that systems will 
always act  to oppose  changes  in magnetic  flux.   For  example,  in  each of  the  above  cases 
the flux into the page is decreasing with time.  The loop doesn’t want a decreased flux, so 
it will generate a clockwise EMF, which will drive a clockwise current, creating a B field 
into  the  page  (inside  the  loop)  to  make  up  for  the  lost  flux.    This,  by  the  way,  is  the 
meaning  of  the  minus  sign  in  Faraday’s  law.    I  recommend  that  you  use  Lenz’s  Law  to 
determine  the  direction  of  the  EMF  and  then  use  Faraday’s  Law  to  calculate  the 
amplitude.   By  the way,  just  as with Faraday’s Law, you don’t need  a physical  circuit  to 
use Lenz’s Law.   Just pretend  that  there  is a wire  in which current could flow and ask    in 
what direction  it would need  to flow  to oppose  the changing flux.   In general, opposing a 
change  in  flux  means  opposing  what  is  happening  to  change  the  flux  (e.g.  forces  or 
torques oppose the change). 
 
 
APPARATUS 
 
1. Magnet Stand 
 
The magnetic flux of Faraday’s Law will be generated by a high field permanent magnet, 
sitting on a support beam so that you may move a coil from above to below and back.

2. Wire Loop, Current Sensor and Science Workshop 750 Interface 
 
The  magnetic  field  will  penetrate  a  loop  of  wire,  which  you  will  plug  into  the  current 
sensor,  which  is  in  turn  plugged  into  channel  A  of  the  750.    In  this  lab  we  will  use  the 
convention  that  positive  current  flows  counter-clockwise  when  observed  from  above.  
The  current  sensor  records  current  that  flows  into  its  red  terminal  and  out  its  negative 
terminal as positive, so make sure  that you hook up  the wire  to  the current  sensor  so  that 
these two conventions are compatible with each other.

GENERALIZED PROCEDURE 
 
This  lab  consists  of  two  parts.    In  each  you will  observe  the  effects  (current &  force)  of 
moving a loop around a dipole. 
 
Part 1: Current and Flux through a Loop Moving Past a Dipole 
You will move  a wire  loop  from  above  to below  a magnetic dipole,  and observe plots of 
the  current  flowing  through  the  loop  (measured)  and  the  flux  through  the  loop 
(calculated). 
 
Part 2: Feeling the Force 
In  this  part  you will  repeat  the motion,  using  a  hollow  aluminum  cylinder  instead  of  the 
wire  loop.    In  doing  so  you  will  be  able  to  feel  the  force  on  the  cylinder  due  to  Lenz’s 
Law.

Answer these questions on a separate sheet of paper and turn them in before the lab 
 
 
1.   Calculating Flux from Current and Faraday’s Law 
 
In  part  1  of  this  lab  you  will  move  a  coil  from  well  above  to  well  below  a  strong 
permanent magnet.   You will measure  the  current  in  the  loop  during  this motion  using  a 
current sensor.  The program will also display the flux “measured” through the loop, even 
though this value is never directly measured.  In this problem you will understand how. 
 
(a) 
Starting from Faraday’s Law and Ohm’s law, write an equation relating the 
current in the loop to the time derivative of the flux through the loop. 
 
(b) 
Now integrate that expression to get the time dependence of the flux through the 
loop Φ(t) as a function of current I(t).  What assumption must the software make (what 
value must it arbitrarily set) before it can plot flux vs. time? 
 
2.   Predictions:  Coil Moving Past Magnetic Dipole 
 
In moving the coil over the magnet, measurements of current and flux for each of several 
motions  will  look  like  one  of  the  below  plots.    For  current,  counter-clockwise  when 
viewed  from  above  is  positive.    For  flux,  upwards  is  positive.    The  north  pole  of  the 
magnet is pointing up.

In  part  2  of  this  lab  you  will  feel  the  force  on  a  conducting  loop  as  it  moves  past  the 
magnet.  For the following conditions, in what direction should the magnetic force point?

4. Feeling the Force 
 
In  part  2,  rather  than  using  the  same  coil  we  use  in  part  1,  we  will  instead  use  an 
aluminum  cylinder  to  “better  feel”  the  force.   What  possible  differences  could make  the 
cylinder work  better  than  the  coil?    If we were  to  double  the  number  of  turns  in  the  coil 
would  we  be  more  likely  to  be  able  to  feel  the  force,  less  likely,  or  would  there  be  no 
difference?    In  case  you  are  interested,  the  wire  is  copper,  and  of  roughly  the  same 
diameter  as  the  thickness  of  the  aluminum  cylinder,  although  this  information  won’t 
necessarily  help  you  in  answering  the  question.    (HINT:    Write  down  the  equation  for 
force on a current in a magnetic field)

• 

Further Questions (for experiment, thought, future exam questions…) 
 
•  What happens if you move the coil more quickly?  Does the magnitude of the current 
change?  Does the magnitude of the flux change?  In part 2, does the force change? 
If the current, flux or force do not change in this situation, is there anything we could 
do to make them change?  If they do change, what other changes could we make that 
would counter-act the change of moving more quickly? 
•  What happens to the force when the tube is exactly centered on the magnet?  Why? 
•  Do the effects depend on history?  In other words, is moving from the middle to the 
bottom any different if the motion started at the top than if it started at the bottom and 
reversed at the middle? 
•  What happens if we define the direction of positive current to be clockwise (in other 
words, if we flip the coil over)?  Does this change have any affect on our definition of 
flux?

PRE-LAB READING 

INTRODUCTION 
 
When  a  battery  is  connected  to  a  circuit  consisting  of  wires  and  other  circuit  elements 
like resistors and capacitors,  voltages can develop across those elements and currents can 
flow through them.   In this lab we will investigate three types of circuits: those with only 
resistors  in  them  and  those with  resistors  and  either  capacitors  (RC  circuits)  or  inductors 
(RL circuits).   We will confirm that there is a linear relationship between current through 
and potential difference across  resistors  (Ohm’s  law:   V =  IR).   We will also measure  the 
very  different  relationship  between  current  and  voltage  in  a  capacitor  and  an  inductor, 
and study the time dependent behavior of RC and RL circuits. 
 
The Details:  Measuring Voltage and Current 
 
Imagine  you wish  to measure  the  voltage  drop  across  and  current  through  a  resistor  in  a 
circuit.    To  do  so,  you  would  use  a  voltmeter  and  an  ammeter  –  similar  devices  that 
measure  the amount of current  flowing  in one  lead,  through  the device, and out  the other 
lead.   But  they  have  an  important  difference.   An  ammeter  has  a  very  low  resistance,  so 
when  placed  in  series with  the  resistor,  the  current measured  is  not  significantly  affected 
(Fig.  1a).   A  voltmeter,  on  the  other  hand,  has  a  very  high  resistance,  so when  placed  in 
parallel  with  the  resistor  (thus  seeing  the  same  voltage  drop)  it  will  draw  only  a  very 
small amount of current  (which  it can convert  to voltage using Ohm’s Law VR = Vmeter = 
ImeterRmeter), and again will not appreciably change the circuit (Fig. 1b).

through  the  resistor  (a)  the  ammeter  is  placed  in  series  with  it.    To  measure  the  voltage 
drop across the resistor (b) the voltmeter is placed in parallel with it. 

 

E06-1

The Details:  Capacitors 
 
Capacitors  store  charge,  and  develop  a  voltage  drop  V  across  them  proportional  to  the 
amount of charge Q that they have stored:  V = Q/C.  The constant of proportionality C is 
the  capacitance  (measured  in  Farads  =  Coulombs/Volt),  and  determines  how  easily  the 
capacitor can store charge.  Typical circuit capacitors range from picofarads (1 pF = 10-12 
F)  to millifarads  (1 mF  =  10-3  F).    In  this  lab we will  use microfarad  capacitors  (1  µF  = 
10-6 F). 
 
RC Circuits 
 
Consider  the  circuit  shown  in  Figure  2.  The  capacitor  (initially  uncharged)  is  connected 
. At t = 0, the switch  S  is closed.

In  class  we  derived  expressions  for  the  time-dependent  charge  on,  voltage  across,  and 
current  through  the  capacitor,  but  even  without  solving  differential  equations  a  little 
thought  should  allow  us  to  get  a  good  idea  of  what  happens.    Initially  the  capacitor  is 
uncharged  and  hence  has  no  voltage  drop  across  it  (it  acts  like  a wire  or  “short  circuit”).  
This  means  that  the  full  voltage  rise  of  the  battery  is  dropped  across  the  resistor,  and 
hence current must be flowing  in  the circuit (VR = IR).   As  time goes on,  this current will 
“charge  up”  the  capacitor  –  the  charge  on  it  and  the  voltage  drop  across  it will  increase, 
and hence  the voltage drop across  the  resistor and  the current  in  the circuit will decrease.  
This idea is captured in the graphs of Fig. 3.

E06-2

After the capacitor is “fully charged,” with its voltage essentially equal to the voltage of the 
battery, the capacitor acts like a break in the wire or “open circuit,” and the current is 
essentially zero.  Now we “shut off” the battery (replace it with a wire).  The capacitor will 
then release its charge, driving current through the circuit.  In this case, the voltage across 
the capacitor and across the resistor are equal, and hence charge, voltage and current all do 
the same thing, decreasing with time.  As you saw in class, this decay is exponential, 
characterized by a time constant t, as pictured in fig. 4.

resistor, and hence the charge on the capacitor and current in the circuit all (b) decay

The Details:  Inductors 
 
Inductors  store  energy  in  the  form  of  an  internal  magnetic  field,  and  find  their  behavior 
dominated by Faraday’s Law.  In any circuit in which they are placed they create an EMF 
ε  proportional  to  the  time  rate  of  change  of  current  I  through  them:   ε  =  L  dI/dt.    The 
constant  of  proportionality  L  is  the  inductance  (measured  in  Henries  =  Ohm  s),  and 
determines  how  strongly  the  inductor  reacts  to  current  changes  (and  how  large  a  self 
energy  it contains  for a given current).   Typical circuit  inductors  range  from nanohenries 
to  hundreds  of  millihenries.    The  direction  of  the  induced  EMF  can  be  determined  by 
Lenz’s Law:  it will always oppose the change (inductors try to keep the current constant) 
 
RL Circuits

current  flows  in  the  circuit.    At  t=0  the  switch  is  closed 
and current I can begin to flow, as indicated by the arrow. 
.

 

E06-3

As  we  saw  in  class,  before  the  switch  is  closed  there  is  no  current  in  the  circuit.   When 
the switch is closed the inductor wants to keep the same current as an instant ago – none.  
Thus it will set up an EMF that opposes the current flow.  At first the EMF is identical to 
that of  the battery  (but  in  the opposite direction) and no current will  flow.   Then, as  time 
passes, the inductor will gradually relent and current will begin to flow.  After a long time 
a  constant  current  (I  =  V/R)  will  flow  through  the  inductor,  and  it  will  be  content  (no 
changing current means no changing B  field means no changing magnetic  flux means no 
EMF).  The resulting EMF and current are pictured in Fig. 6.

Figure 6  (a) “EMF generated by the inductor” decreases with time (this is what a 
voltmeter hooked in parallel with the inductor would show) (b) the current and hence the 
voltage across the resistor increase with time, as the inductor ‘relaxes.’ 
 
After the inductor is “fully charged,” with the current essentially constant, we can shut off 
the battery (replace it with a wire).  Without an inductor in the circuit the current would 
instantly drop to zero, but the inductor does not want this rapid change, and hence 
generates an EMF that will, for a moment, keep the current exactly the same as it was 
before the battery was shut off.  In this case, the EMF generated by the inductor and 
voltage across the resistor are equal, and hence EMF, voltage and current all do the same 
thing, decreasing exponentially with time as pictured in fig. 7.

The Details:  Non-Ideal Inductors 
So far we have always assumed that circuit elements are ideal, for example, that inductors 
only  have  inductance  and  not  capacitance  or  resistance.    This  is  generally  a  decent 
assumption,  but  in  reality  no  circuit  element  is  truly  ideal,  and  today  we  will  need  to 
consider  this.    In  particular,  today’s  “inductor”  has  both  inductance  and  resistance  (real 
inductor =  ideal  inductor  in  series with  resistor).   Although  there  is no way  to physically 
separate  the  inductor  from  the  resistor  in  this circuit element, with a  little  thought (which 
you will do in the pre-lab) you will be able to measure both the resistance and inductance.  
 
APPARATUS 
 
1.  Science Workshop 750 Interface 
 
In  this  lab  we  will  again  use  the  Science  Workshop  750  interface  to  create  a  “variable 
battery” which we  can  turn  on  and  off, whose  voltage we  can  change  and whose  current 
we can measure. 
 
2. AC/DC Electronics Lab Circuit Board 
We will also use, for the first of several times, the circuit board pictured in Fig. 8.  This is 
a  general  purpose  board,  with  (A)  battery  holders,  (B)  light  bulbs,  (C)  a  push  button 
switch, (D) a variable resistor called a potentiometer, and (E) an  inductor.   It also has (F) 
a  set  of  8  isolated  pads with  spring  connectors  that  circuit  components  like  resistors  and 
capacitors can easily be pushed into.  Each pad has two spring connectors connected by a 
wire  (as  indicated  by  the  white  lines).    The  right-most  pads  also  have  banana  plug 
receptacles, which we will use to connect to the output of the 750.

3. Current & Voltage Sensors 
 
Recall  that  both  current  and  voltage  sensors  follow  the  convention  that  red  is  “positive” 
and black “negative.”   That  is,  the current sensor  records currents  flowing  in  the  red  lead 
and  out  the  black  as  positive.    The  voltage  sensor  measures  the  potential  at  the  red  lead 
minus that at the black lead.

4. Resistors & Capacitors 
 
We  will  work  with  resistors  and  capacitors  in  this  lab.    Resistors  (Fig.  8a)  have  color 
bands  that  indicate  their  value  (see  appendix  A  if  you  are  interested  in  learning  to  read 
this code), whereas capacitors (Fig. 8b) are typically stamped with a numerical value.

resistors  look  the  same,  with  4  or  5  colored  bands  indicating  the  resistance.  
Capacitors  on  the  other  hand  come  in  a  wide  variety  of  packages  and  are  typically 
stamped both with their capacitance and with a maximum working voltage. 

 

E06-6

GENERALIZED PROCEDURE 
 
This lab consists of five main parts.  In each you will set up a circuit and measure voltage 
and  current while  the  battery  periodically  turns  on  and  off.    In  the  last  two  parts  you  are 
encouraged  to  develop  your  own  methodology  for  measuring  the  resistance  and 
inductance of the coil on the AC/DC Electronics Lab Circuit Board both with and without 
a  core  inserted.   The  core  is  a metal  cylinder which  is  designed  to  slide  into  the  coil  and 
affect its properties in some way that you will measure. 
 
Part 1: Measure Voltage Across & Current Through a Resistor 
Here  you  will  measure  the  voltage  drop  across  and  current  through  a  single  resistor 
attached to the output of the 750. 
 
Part 2: Resistors in Parallel 
Now  attach  a  second  resistor  in  parallel  to  the  first  and  see  what  happens  to  the  voltage 
drop across and current through the first. 
 
Part 3: Measuring Voltage and Current in an RC Circuit 
In  this part you will create a series RC (resistor/capacitor) circuit with  the battery  turning 
on  and  off  so  that  the  capacitor  charges  then  discharges.    You  will  measure  the  time 
constant  in  two  different  ways  (see  Pre-Lab  #5)  and  use  this  measurement  to  determine 
the capacitance of the capacitor. 
 
Part 4: Measure Resistance and Inductance Without a Core 
The battery will alternately  turn on and  turn off.   You will need  to hook up  this source  to 
the  coil  and,  by  measuring  the  voltage  supplied  by  and  current  through  the  battery, 
determine the resistance and inductance of the coil. 
 
Part 5: Measure Resistance and Inductance With a Core 
In this section you will insert a core into the coil and repeat your measurements from part 
1 (or choose a different way to make the measurements).

Experiment 6: Ohm’s Law, RC and RL Circuits 

 
Answer these questions on a separate sheet of paper and turn them in before the lab 
 
1.   Measuring Voltage and Current 
 
In Part 1 of this experiment you will measure the potential drop across and current 
through a single resistor attached to the “variable battery.”  On a diagram similar to the 
one below, indicate where you will attach the leads to the resistor, the battery, the voltage 
V 
A
sensor 
, and the current sensor 
.  For the battery and sensors make sure that you 
indicate which color lead goes where, using the convention that red is “high” (or the 
positive input) and black is “ground.”  Reread the pre-lab description of this board 
carefully to understand the various parts.  When you draw a resistor or other circuit 
element it should go between two pads (dark green areas) with each end touching one of 
the spring clips (the metal coils).  Do NOT just draw a typical circuit diagram.  You need 
to think about how you will actually wire this board during the lab.  RECALL:  ammeters 
must be in series with the element they are measuring current through, while voltmeters 
must be in parallel. 
 

 
 
2.  Resistors in Parallel 
 
In Part 2 you will add a second resistor  in parallel with  the first.   Show where you would 
attach  this  second  resistor  in  the  diagram  you  drew  for  question  1,  making  sure  that  the 
ammeter  continues  to  measure  the  current  through  the  first  resistor  and  the  voltmeter 
measures the voltage across the first resistor. 
 

 

 

E06-9

3.  Measuring the Time Constant τ 
 
As you have seen, current always decays exponentially in RC circuits with a time 
constant τ:  I = I0 exp(-t/τ). 
 
We will measure this time constant in two different ways. 
 
(a)  After measuring the current as a function of 
time we choose two points on the curve 
(t1,I1) and (t2, I2).  What relationship must 
we choose between I2 and I1 in order to 
determine the time constant by subtraction:  
τ = t2 – t1?  Should we be able to find a t2 
that satisfies this for any choice of t1?

e
r

(b)  We can also plot the natural log of the 
current vs. time, as shown at right. If we fit 
a line to this curve we will obtain a slope m 
and a y-intercept b.  From these fitting 
parameters, how can we calculate the time 
constant? 

 
 
(c)  Which of these two methods is more likely 
to help us obtain an accurate measurement 
of the time constant?  Why?

Make  sure  that  you  record  your  answers  to  question  3  in  your 
notes as you will need them for the lab. 
 
 
4.  RL Circuits 

Consider the circuit at left, consisting of a battery (emf 
ε), an inductor L, resistor R and switch S. 
 
For times t<0 the switch is open and there is no current 
in the circuit.  At t=0 the switch is closed. 
 
(a) 
Using Kirchhoff’s loop rules (really Faraday’s 
law now), write an equation relating the emf on the 
battery, the current in the circuit and the time 
derivative of the current in the circuit. 

E06-10

In class we stated that this equation was solved by an exponential.  In other words: 
I = A(X – exp(-t/τ)) 

 
(b) 

(c) 

 
Plug this expression into the differential equation you obtained in (a) in order to 
confirm that it indeed is a solution and to determine what the time constant τ and 
the constants A and X are.  What would be a better label for A?  (HINT:  You will 
also need to use the initial condition for current.  What is I(t=0)?). 
Now  that  you  know  the  time  dependence  for  the  current  I  in  the  circuit  you  can 
also  determine  the  voltage  drop VR  across  resistor  and  the  EMF  generated  by  the 
inductor.   Do  so,  and  confirm  that  your  expressions match  the  plots  in  Fig.  6a  or 
2b. 

 
 
5.  ‘Discharging’ an Inductor 
 
After  a  long  time  T  the  current  will  reach  an  equilibrium 
value and inductor will be “fully charged.”  At this point we 
turn  off  the  battery  (ε=0),  allowing  the  inductor  to 
‘discharge,’ as pictured at left.  Repeat each of the steps a-c 
instead  of  exp(-t/τ),  our 
in  problem  4,  noting 
that 
expression for current will now contain exp(-(t-T)/τ).   
 

 
 
6.  The Coil 
 
The  coil  you will  be measuring  has  is made  of  thin  copper wire  (radius  ~  0.25 mm)  and 
has  about  600  turns  of  average  diameter  25  mm  over  a  length  of  25  mm.    What 
approximately  should  the  resistance  and  inductance  of  the  coil  be?    The  resistivity  of 
copper at  room  temperature  is around 20 nΩ-m.   Note  that your calculations  can only be 
approximate because this is not at all an ideal solenoid (where length >> diameter). 

 

E06-11

7.  A Real Inductor 
 
As mentioned above, in this lab you will work with a coil that does not behave as an ideal 
inductor, but rather as an ideal inductor in series with a resistor.  For this reason you have 
no way to independently measure the voltage drop across the resistor or the EMF induced 
by the inductor, but instead must measure them together.  None-the-less, you want to get 
information about both.  In this problem you will figure out how. 
 
 (a)  In the lab you will hook up the circuit of problem 4 with the ideal inductor L of that 
problem now replaced by a coil that is a non-ideal inductor – an inductor L and 
resistor r in series.  The battery will periodically turn on and off, displaying a voltage 
as shown here:

Sketch the current through the battery as well as what a voltmeter hooked across the 
coil would show versus time for the two periods shown above.  Assume that the 
period of the battery turning off and on is comparable to but longer than several time 
constants of the circuit.  

 
(b)  How can you tell from your plot of the voltmeter across the coil that the coil is not 
an ideal inductor?  Indicate the relevant feature clearly on the plot.  Can you 
determine the resistance of the coil, r, from this feature? 

 
(c)  In the lab you will find it easier to make measurements if you do NOT use an 
additional resistor R, but instead simply hook the battery directly to the coil.  (Why? 
Because the time constant is difficult to measure with extra resistance in the circuit).  
Plot the current through the battery and the reading on a voltmeter across the coil for 
this case.  We will only bother to measure the current.  Why? 

 
(d)  For this case (only a battery & coil) how will you determine the resistance of the 
coil, r?  How will you determine its inductance L? 

 
 
Make  sure  that  you  record  your  answer  to  7d  in  your  notes  as 
you will need it for the lab.

MEASUREMENTS 
 
Part 1: Measuring the Resistance of a Single Resistor 
1.  Hook  up  the  circuit  as  you  determined  it  should  be  set  up  in  Pre-Lab  #1  (to

“variable battery.”) 
2.  Record  V  and  I  for  1  second.  (Press  the  green  “Go”  button  above  the  graph).

Question 1 and the typical expression for an RC time constant, what is the capacitance of 
the capacitor?

capacitor?

E06-16

Further Questions (for experiment, thought, future exam questions…) 
 
•  What happens if we instead put the second resistor in parallel with the first? 
•  What if we instead put the second resistor in parallel with the capacitor?  Does the 
initial current change?  The final current?  The final voltage (and hence charge) on 
the capacitor? 
•  What if we change the order of the elements in the circuit (e.g. put the capacitor 
between the two resistors, or switch the leads from the battery)? 
•  The ammeter is marked as having a 1 ohm resistance, small, but not tiny.  Can you 
see the effects of the ammeter resistance in the circuits of part 1 and 2?  Can you 
measure the voltage drop across the ammeter?  Does this make the measurement of 
the current through the resistor inaccurate? 
•  What happens if we put a resistor R in series with the coil?  In parallel with the coil? 
•  What happens if you make the battery switch on and off with a period shorter than the 
time constant of the circuit?  Would you still be able to determine the inductance L 
and resistance r of the coil using the same method? 
•  What happens if you only partially insert the core into the coil?  Can you 
continuously adjust the core’s effects or there an abrupt jump from one behavior to 
another?  Would another core (like your finger) have the same effects? 
If the coil were made of some superconducting material, what would its resistance 
be?  Would the EMF you measure be any different?  Would the potential difference

Experiment 7: Undriven & Driven RLC Circuits 

 
OBJECTIVES  
 
1.  To explore the time dependent behavior of RLC Circuits, both driven (with an AC 
function generator) and undriven  
2.  To understand the idea of resonance, and to determine the behavior of current and 
voltage in a driven RLC circuit above, below and at the resonant frequency 
 

 

PRE-LAB READING 

INTRODUCTION 
 
As most  children  know,  if  you  get  a  push  on  a  swing  and  just  sit  still  on  it,  you  will  go 
back  and  forth,  gradually  slowing  down  to  a  stop.    If,  on  the  other  hand,  you move  your 
body  back  and  forth  you  can  drive  the  swing,  making  it  swing  higher  and  higher.    This 
only  works  if  you  move  at  the  correct  rate  though  –  too  fast  or  too  slow  and  the  swing 
will do nothing. 
 
This  is  an  example  of  resonance  in  a mechanical  system.    In  this  lab we will  explore  its 
electrical  analog  –  the RLC  (resistor,  inductor,  capacitor)  circuit  –  and  better  understand 
what happens when  it  is undriven and when  it  is driven above, below and at  the  resonant 
frequency. 
 
The Details:  Oscillations 
 
In  this  lab you will be  investigating current and voltages  (EMFs)  in RLC circuits.   These 
oscillate  as  a  function  of  time,  either  continuously  (Fig.  1a,  for  driven  circuits)  or  in  a 
decaying fashion (Fig. 1b, for undriven circuits).

Undriven Circuits:  Thinking about Oscillations 
 
Consider  the RLC  circuit  of  fig.  2  below.   The  capacitor  has  an  initial  charge Q0  (it was 
charged by a battery no longer in the circuit), but it can’t go anywhere because the switch 
is open.   When  the  switch  is  closed,  the positive  charge will  flow off  the  top plate of  the 
capacitor,  through  the  resistor  and  inductor,  and  on  to  the  bottom  plate  of  the  capacitor.  
This  is  the  same  behavior  that  we  saw  in  RC  circuits.    In  those  circuits,  however,  the 
current flow stops as soon as all  the positive charge has flowed  to  the negatively charged 
plate,  leaving  both  plates  with  zero  charge.    The  addition  of  an  inductor,  however, 
introduces  inertia  into  the circuit, keeping  the current  flowing even when  the capacitor  is 
completely discharged, and forcing it to charge in the opposite polarity (Fig 2b). 
  

(a) 

(b) 

 

 

 
 
Figure  2  Undriven  RLC  circuit.    (a)  For  t<0  the  switch  S  is  open  and  although  the 
capacitor  is  charged  (Q  =  Q0)  no  current  flows  in  the  circuit.    (b)  A  half  period  after 
closing  the  switch  the  capacitor  again  comes  to  a  maximum  charge,  this  time  with  the 
positive charge on the lower plate. 
 
This  oscillation  of  positive  charge  from  the  upper  to  lower  plate  of  the  capacitor  is  only 
one of the oscillations occurring in the circuit.  For the two times pictured above (t=0 and 
t=0.5 T) the charge on the capacitor is a maximum and no current flows in the circuit.  At 
intermediate  times  current  is  flowing,  and,  for  example,  at  t  =  0.25  T  the  current  is  a 
maximum and  the charge on  the capacitor  is zero.   Thus another oscillation  in  the circuit 
is  between  charge  on  the  capacitor  and  current  in  the  circuit.    This  corresponds  to  yet 
another  oscillation  in  the  circuit,  that  of  energy  between  the  capacitor  and  the  inductor.  
When  the  capacitor  is  fully  charged  and  the  current  is  zero,  the  capacitor  stores  energy

energy between  the capacitor and  inductor would be perfect and  the current  (and voltage 
across  the  capacitor  and  EMF  induced  by  the  inductor) would  oscillate  as  in  Fig.  1a.   A 
resistor, however, damps the circuit, removing energy by dissipating power through Joule 
heating (P=I2R), and eventually ringing the current down to zero, as in Fig. 1b.  Note that 
only  the  resistor  dissipates  power.    The  capacitor  and  inductor  both  store  energy  during 
half the cycle and then completely release it during the other half.

Driven Circuits:  Resonance 
 
Instead of simply charging  the capacitor and  then  letting  the system go, we could  instead 
add a battery that periodically pushed current through the system.  Such a battery is called 
an  AC  (alternating  current)  function  generator,  and  the  voltage  it  generates  can  oscillate 
with a given amplitude, frequency and shape (in this lab we will use a sine wave).  When 
hooked  up  to  an  RLC  circuit  we  get  a  driven  RLC  circuit  (Fig.  3a)  where  the  current 
oscillates at the same frequency as, but not necessarily in phase with, the driving voltage.  
The  amplitude  of  the  current  depends  on  the  driving  frequency,  reaching  a  maximum 
when the function generator drives at the resonant frequency, just like a swing (Fig. 3b)

current I0 reaches a maximum when the circuit is driven at its resonant frequency 

 
One Element at a Time 
 
In order  to understand how  this  resonance happens  in  an RLC  circuit,  its  easiest  to build 
up an intuition of how each individual circuit element responds to oscillating currents.  A 
resistor  obeys  Ohm’s  law:    V  =  IR.    It  doesn’t  care  whether  the  current  is  constant  or 
oscillating  –  the  amplitude  of  voltage  doesn’t  depend  on  the  frequency  and  neither  does 
the phase (the response voltage is always in phase with the current). 
 
A  capacitor  is  different.    Here  if  you  drive  current  at  a  low  frequency  the  capacitor  will 
fill up and have a large voltage across it, whereas if you drive current at a high frequency 
the  capacitor  will  begin  discharging  before  it  has  a  chance  to  completely  charge,  and 
hence  it  won’t  build  up  as  large  a  voltage.    We  see  that  the  voltage  is  frequency 
dependent and that the current leads the voltage (with an uncharged capacitor you see the 
current flow and then the charge/potential on the capacitor build up). 
 
Figure 4 Current and Voltage for a Capacitor 
A  capacitor  driven  with  a  sinusoidal  current  will 
develop  a  voltage  that  lags  the  current  by  90º  (the 
voltage  peak  comes  ¼  period  later  than  the  current 
peak). 
 
 

 

E07-3

An  inductor  is  similar  to  a  capacitor  but  the  opposite.    The  voltage  is  still  frequency 
dependent  but  the  inductor  will  have  a  larger  voltage  when  the  frequency  is  high  (it 
doesn’t  like change and high  frequency means  lots of change).   Now  the current  lags  the 
voltage  –  if  you  try  to  drive  a  current  through  an  inductor  with  no  current  in  it,  the 
inductor will  immediately  put  up  a  fight  (create  an EMF)  and  then  later  allow  current  to 
flow. 
 
When  we  put  these  elements  together  we  will  see  that  at  low  frequencies  the  capacitor 
will  “dominate”  (it  fills  up  limiting  the  current)  and  current  will  lead  whereas  at  high 
frequencies  the  inductor  will  dominate  (it  fights  the  rapid  changes)  and  current  will  lag.  
At  resonance  the  frequency  is  such  that  these  two  effects balance  and  the  current will be 
largest  in  the  circuit.    Also  at  this  frequency  the  current  is  in  phase  with  the  driving 
voltage (the AC function generator). 
 
Resistance, Reactance and Impedance 
 
We  can  make  the  relationship  between  the  magnitude  of  the  current  through  a  circuit 
element  and  magnitude  of  the  voltage  drop  across  it  (or  EMF  generated  by  it  for  an 
inductor)  more  concrete  by  introducing  the  idea  of  impedance.    Impedance  (usually 
denoted  by  Z)  is  a  generalized  resistance,  and  is  composed  of  two  parts  –  resistance  (R) 
and  reactance  (X).    All  of  these  terms  refer  to  a  constant  of  proportionality  between  the 
magnitude  of  current  through  and  voltage  across  (EMF  generated  by)  a  circuit  element:  
V0 = I0Z, V = IR, V0 = I0X.  The difference is in the phase between the current and voltage.  
In  an  element with  only  resistance  (a  resistor)  the  current  through  it  is  in  phase with  the 
voltage  across  it.    In  an  element  with  only  reactance  (capacitor,  inductor)  the  current 
leads  or  lags  the  voltage  by  90º.    A  combination  of  these  elements  in  series  or  parallel

In  this  lab  we  will  again  use  the  Science  Workshop  750  interface  as  an  AC  function 
generator, whose  voltage we  can  set  and  current we  can measure.   We will  also  use  it  to 
measure the voltage across the capacitor using a voltage probe.  
 
2. AC/DC Electronics Lab Circuit Board 
We  will  also  again  use  the  circuit  board,  set  up  with  a  100  µF 
capacitor  in  series  with  the  coil  (which  serves  both  as  the 
resistor and inductor in the circuit), as pictured at left.

In  addition, we will  connect  a voltage probe  in parallel with  the 
capacitor (not pictured). 
 
 
 
 
 
GENERALIZED PROCEDURE 
 
In  this  lab  you  will  measure  the  behavior  of  a  series  RLC  circuit,  both  when  driven 
sinusoidally by a function generator and when undriven. 
 
Part 1: Free Oscillations in an Undriven RLC Circuit 
The  capacitor  is  charged with  a DC battery which  is  then  turned off,  allowing  the  circuit 
to ring down. 
 
Part 2: Energy Ringdown in an Undriven RLC Circuit 
Part 1 is repeated, except that the energy is reported instead of current and voltage. 
 
Part 3: Driving the RLC Circuit on Resonance 
Now the circuit is driven with a sinusoidal voltage and you will adjust to frequency while 
monitoring plots of I(t) and V(t) as well as V vs. I. 
 
Part 4: What’s The Frequency? 
The  circuit  is  driven with  an  unknown  frequency  and  you must  determine  if  its  above  or 
below resonance. 
 
Part 5: What’s That Trace? 
Current  and  voltage  across  the  function  generator  and  capacitor  are  recorded,  but  you 
must determine which trace is which.

Part 3: Driving the RLC Circuit on Resonance 
Now we will use the function generator to drive the circuit with a sinusoidal voltage. 
1.  Enter  the  frequency  that  you  measured  in  part  1  of  the  lab  as  a  starting  point  to 
find the resonant frequency. 
2.  Press GO to start recording the function generator current and voltage vs. time, as 
well as a “phase plot” of voltage vs. current. 
3.  Adjust  the  frequency  up  and  down  to  find  the  resonant  frequency  and  observe 
what happens when driving above and below resonance. 

 
Question 4: 
What is the resonant frequency?  What are two ways in which you know? 
 
 
 
Question 5: 
What is the impedance of the circuit when driven on resonance (hint: use the phase plot)? 
 
 
Question 6: 
When  driving  on  resonance,  insert  the  core  into  the  inductor.    Are  you  now  driving  at, 
above or below the new resonant frequency of the circuit?  How can you tell?  Why? 
 
 
 
Part 4: What’s The Frequency? 
For  the  remainder of  the  lab you will make  some measurements where you are given 
incomplete  information  (for example, you won’t be shown  the  frequency or won’t be 
told  what  is  being  plotted).    From  the  results  you  must  determine  the  missing 
information.    If  you  find  this  difficult,  play  with  the  circuit  using  the  “further 
questions” tab to get a better feeling for how the circuit behaves. 
1.  Remove the core from the inductor 
2.  Press GO to record the function generator current and voltage  
Question 7: 
At  this  frequency  is  the  circuit  capacitor-  or  inductor-like?    Are  we  above  or  below  
resonance?

Part 5: What’s That Trace? 
1.  Press  GO  to  record  the  function  generator  current  and  voltage  as  well  as  the 
voltage  across  the  capacitor.    Note  that  you  are  not  told  which  trace  corresponds 
to which value.  

 
Question 8: 
What value is recorded in each of the three traces (I, VFG or VC)?  How do you know? 
 
 
 
 
Question 9: 
Are we above, below or on resonance?  How do you know? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Further Questions (for experiment, thought, future exam questions…) 
 
•  What happens if we insert the coil core in the undriven circuit? 
•  For a random frequency can you bring the circuit into resonance by slowly inserting 
the core into the coil?  Are there any conditions on the frequency (e.g. does it need to 
be above or below the resonant frequency of the circuit with the empty coil)? 
•  Could you do part 5 if you were given only two traces instead of three?  Would it 
matter which two you were given? 
•  What is the energy doing in the driven case?  Is the resistor still dissipating power?  If 
so, where is this power coming from? 
•  What happens to the resonant frequency of the circuit if a resistor is placed in series 
with the capacitor and coil?  In parallel?  NOTE:  You can use the variable resistor, 
called a potentiometer or “pot” (just to the left of the coil, connect to the center and 
right most contacts, allowing you to adjust the extra resistance from 0 Ω to 3.3Ω by 
simply turning the knob). 
•  With the resistor in series with the coil and capacitor, at what frequency is the energy 
dissipation a maximum?  How could you verify this experimentally?

PRE-LAB READING 

 

INTRODUCTION 
 
Heinrich  Hertz  first  generated  electromagnetic  waves  in  1888,  and  we  replicate  Hertz’s 
original  experiment  here.    The  method  he  used  was  to  charge  and  discharge  a  capacitor 
connected to a spark gap and a quarter-wave antenna.  When the spark “jumps” across the 
gap  the  antenna  is  excited by  this discharge  current,  and  charges oscillate back  and  forth 
in the antenna at the antenna’s natural resonance frequency.  For a brief period around the 
breakdown  (“spark”),  the  antenna  radiates  electromagnetic waves  at  this  high  frequency.  
We  will  detect  and  measure  the  wavelength  λ  of  these  bursts  of  radiation.    Using  the 
f
cλ = = ×
3 10 cm/s
10
relation 
,  we  will  then  deduce  the  natural  resonance  frequency  of 
the  antenna,  and  show  that  this  frequency  is  what  we  expect  on  the  basis  of  the  very 
simple considerations given below.   
 

  
Figure 1 Spark-gap transmitter.  The 
“33”  is  a  33  pF  capacitor.    It  is 
responsible  for  storing  energy  to  be 
rapidly  discharged  across  a  “spark 
gap,” formed by two tungsten cylinders 
pictured  directly  above  it  (one  with  a 
vertical axis, one horizontal). Two MΩ 
limit  current  off  of 
resistors 
the 
capacitor  and  back  out 
the 
leads, 
protecting  the  user  from  shocks  from 
the  800  V  to  which  the  capacitor  will 
be  charged.    They  also  limit  radiation 
at incorrect frequencies.

The  33-pF  capacitor  shown  in  fig.  1  is  charged  by  a  high-voltage  power  supply  on  the 
circuit board provided.  This HVPS voltage is typically 800 V, but this is safe because the 
current  from  the  supply  is  limited  to a very  small value.   When  the electric  field  that  this 
voltage  generates  in  the  “spark  gap”  between  the  tungsten  rods  is  high  enough  (when  it 
exceeds  the breakdown  field of  air of  about 1000 V/mm)  the  capacitor discharges  across 
the  gap  (fig.  2a).   The  voltage  on  the  capacitor  then  rebuilds,  until  high  enough  to  cause 
another  spark,  resulting  in  a  continuous  series  of  charges  followed  by  rapid  bursts  of 
discharge (fig. 2b). 
 

(a) 

(b) 

 
 
Figure  2  Charging  and  Discharging  the  Capacitor.    The  capacitor  is  slowly  charged 
(limited  by  the  RC  time  constant,  with  R  =  4.5  MΩ)  and  then  (a)  rapidly  discharges 
across  the spark gap,  resulting  in  (b) a series of slow charge/rapid discharge bursts.   This 
is an example of a “relaxation oscillator.” 
 
The radiation we are seeking is generated in this discharge. 
 

Resonant Frequency of the Antenna 
 
The frequency of the radiation is determined by the time it takes charge to flow along the 
antenna.  Just  before  breakdown,  the  two  halves  of  the  antenna  are  charged  positive  and 
( ,
)+ −
negative 
 forming an electric dipole. There  is an electric  field  in  the vicinity of  this 
dipole.    During  the  short  time  during  which  the  capacitor  discharges,  the  electric  field 
decays and large currents flow, producing magnetic fields.  The currents flow through the 
spark  gap  and  charge  the  antenna  with  the  opposite  polarity.    This  process  continues  on 
and on for many cycles at the resonance frequency of the antenna.  The oscillations damp 
out  as  energy  is  dissipated  and  some  of  the  energy  is  radiated  away  until  the  antenna  is 
finally discharged.  
 

How  fast do  these oscillations  take place –  that  is, what  is  the resulting frequency 
of  the  radiated  energy?    An  estimate  can  be  made  by  thinking  about  the  charge  flow  in 
the antenna once a spark in the gap allows charge to flow from one side to the other.  If 
 
l

is  the  length  of  one  of  the  halves  of  the  antenna  (about 
 in  our  case),  then  the 
distance  that  the  charge  oscillation  travels  going  from  the  ( ,
)+ −  polarity  to  the  ( ,
)− +  
polarity  and  back  again  to  the  original  ( ,
)+ −  polarity  is 
 (from  one  tip  of  the  antenna 
4l
to  the  other  tip  and  back  again).    The  time  T  it  takes  for  this  to  happen,  assuming  that 
information  flows  at  the  speed  of  light  c,  is

Detecting (Receiving) the Radiation 

 

E08-2

 
In addition to generating EM radiation we will want to detect it.  For this purpose we will 
use  a  receiving  antenna  through  which  charge  will  be  driven  by  the  incoming  EM 
radiation.  This current is rectified and amplified, and you will read its average value on a 
multimeter  (although  the  fields  come  in  bursts,  the  multimeter  will  show  a  roughly 
constant amplitude because the time between bursts is very short, as you will calculate in 
pre-lab #1).

reating Standing Waves (sort of) Using a Reflector 

If a conducting sheet (blue in the figure at left) is placed in the path of 
an  electromagnetic  wave,  surface  currents  will  be  generated  in  the 
conductor  that  reradiate  the  wave  backwards,  as  a  reflected  wave.  
The  phase  of  the  reflected  wave  is  set  so  as  to  guarantee  that  the 
electric  field  at  the  surface  of  the  conductor  is  always  zero.    The 
reflected  and  incoming  waves  interfere,  summing  to  create  a  new 
standing wave, which has nodes  every half wavelength.    In  the  figure 
at left at the time pictured the waves cancel everywhere.  A small time 
later  this will  no  longer  be  the  case,  and  the  cancellation will  only  be 
perfect at those nodes (as you will calculate in pre-lab #3). 

 
hus  in  order  to  measure  the  wavelength  of  radiation  we  can  simply  move  the  receiver 
T
between  the  reflector  and  the  antenna  and  look  for  nodes.    Using  the  distance  between 
nodes we can then calculate the wavelength. 
 
T
his ideal picture doesn’t perfectly hold in our case.  The antenna creates dipole radiation 
rather  than  plane  waves,  so  the  amplitude  of  the  radiation  is  not  spatially  constant,  but 
instead falls with distance from  the  transmitter.   Thus we do not create a perfect standing 
wave.    However,  minima  in  the  radiation  intensity  will  still  be  created  where  standing 
wave nodes occur in the ideal case, and you will still be able to measure the wavelength.

for 
charging  the  transmitter,  as  well 
as  an  amplifier  for  boosting  the 
signal  from  the  receiver.    It  is

3.  Science Workshop 750 Interface and Voltage Probe 
 
We  read  the  signal  strength  from  the  receiver  –  proportional  to  the  radiation  intensity  at 
the  receiver  –  by  connecting  the  output  (lower  right  of  circuit  board)  to  a  voltage  probe 
plugged in to channel A of the 750. 
 
 
GENERALIZED PROCEDURE 
 
In  this  lab  you  will  turn  on  the  transmitter,  and  then,  using  the  receiver,  measure  the 
intensity  of  the  radiation  at  various  locations  and  orientations.    It  consists  of  three  main 
parts. 
 
Part 1: Polarization of the Emitted Radiation 
In this part you will measure to see if the produced radiation is polarized, and if so, along 
what axis. 
 
Part 2: Angular Dependence of the Emitted Radiation 
Next,  you  will  measure  the  angular  dependence  of  the  radiation,  determining  if  your 
position relative to the transmitter matters. 
 
Part 3: Wavelength of the Emitted Radiation 
Finally,  you will measure  the wavelength  (and  hence  frequency)  of  the  emitted  radiation 
by  placing  a  reflector  near  the  transmitter  and  creating  a  standing-wave  like  pattern.   By 
measuring  the  distances  between  minima,  you  can  determine  the  wavelength  (as 
calculated in pre-lab #3).

Answer these questions on a separate sheet of paper and turn them in before the lab 
 
1.  Spark Gap Distance and Timing 
The  time  to  charge  the  transmitter  capacitor  until  it  discharges  depends  on  the  resistance 
in  the  charging  circuit  (R  =  4.5  MΩ),  the  capacitance  (C  =  33  pF)  and  the  voltage 
required  to  initiate  breakdown.    Assume  that  the  power  supply  supplies  800  V  but  that 
breakdown typically occurs at a voltage of about 500 V on the capacitor. 
 
(a) 

Thinking of the tungsten electrodes as parallel plates, how far apart must they be 
in order generate a spark at 500 V? 
In reality, the electrodes aren’t parallel plates, but rather cylinders with a fairly 
small radius of curvature.  Given this, will the distance needed between the 
electrodes to generate sparking be smaller or larger than you calculated in (a)?  
Why? 
About how much time will it take for the power supply to charge the capacitor 
from empty to discharge? 

(b) 

(c) 

the wavelength of the emitted radiation? 
the frequency of the emitted radiation? 

 
2.  Wavelength and Frequency of the Radiation

Using l = 31 mm for the length of one of the arms of the antenna, what is 
 
(a) 
(b) 
 
3.  Reflections 
Now place the transmitter some distance in front of a perfectly conducting sheet, oriented 
so  that  the propagation direction of  the waves hitting  the  reflector  is perpendicular  to  the 
plane  of  the  reflector  (so  that  they’ll  reflect  straight  back  out  towards  the  transmitter).  
For  example,  place  the  transmitter  at  z  =  -D  with  the  antenna  parallel  to  the  x-axis,  and 
have the reflector fill the z=0 (xy-) plane. 
(a)  Write  an  equation  for  the  electric  field  component  of  the  radiation  from  the 
transmitter  (the  incident  wave).    Treat  the  field  as  plane  wave,  with  a  constant 
amplitude E0 and angular frequency ω0. 
(b)  What  condition must  the  total  electric  field  satisfy  at  the  surface of  the  conductor 
(z=0)? 
(c)  What is the direction of propagation of the reflected wave? 
(d)  Write  an  equation  for  the  time  dependent  amplitude  &  direction  of  the  reflected 
wave, making the same assumptions as above. 
(e)  Write  an  equation  for  the  total  amplitude  of  the  electric  field  as  a  function  of 
position, by adding (c) and (d). 
Nodes  are  locations  (in  this  case  planes)  where  the  electric  field  is  zero  at  all 
times.  What is the distance between nodes along the z-axis? 
(g)  What is the numerical distance you thus expect for our transmitter (i.e. use 2a)?

Question 4: 
Which kind of motion, horizontal or vertical, shows a  larger change  in radiation  intensity 
over the range of motion? 
 
 
 
Part 3: Wavelength of the Emitted Radiation 
Now  we  will  use  the  reflector  to  create  an  interference  pattern  that  we  can  use  to 
measure the wavelength of the radiation.  We will do this in two ways. 
1.  Position  the  reflector  so  that  it  is  about  30-
40 cm
 from  the  spark  gap  transmitter 
(note that you can insert the tube into notch on the bottom of the reflector in order 
to  make  a  stable  base  for  it  to  stand  on).    You  may  need  to  change  this  distance 
slightly to get good results.  Experiment! 
2.  Orient  the  transmitter  so  that  the  propagation  direction  of  the  waves  hitting  the 
reflector  is  perpendicular  to  the  plane  of  the  reflector  (so  that  they’ll  reflect 
straight back out towards the transmitter). 
3.  Place  the  receiver  between  the  transmitter  and  the  reflector  and  then  on  the  other 
side of the reflector to see that the waves are reflected (not at all transmitted). 
4.  Place the receiver, in the best orientation, between the reflector and the transmitter 
very near the reflector. 

 

 

E08-8

Part 3A:  Imprecise Method 
1.  Slowly  move  the  receiver  towards  the  transmitter,  looking  for  a  minimum  in  the 
radiation intensity.  Be careful to keep the receiver at a constant height and in line 
between the transmitter and the reflector. 
2.  Measure the distance between the first and second minimum that you find.   
 
Question 5: 
What is the distance between intensity minima? 
 
 

Part 3B:  More Precise Method 
1.  Slowly  move  the  receiver  towards  the  transmitter,  looking  for  a  minimum  in  the 
radiation intensity. 
2.  Now,  hold  the  receiver  very  steady  and  have  another  group  member  slowly  pull 
the  reflector  away  from  the  receiver.    Because  the  reflector  sits  on  the  table  it  is 
easier to measure the distance it has traveled when the next minimum is found. 
3.  Repeat the measurement several times to get an accurate average distance reading. 

 
Question 6: 
What is the distance between intensity minima? 
 
 
Question 7: 
What is the wavelength of the radiation?  What frequency does this correspond to? 
 
 
 
Further Questions (for experiment, thought, future exam questions…) 
 
• 
Is there any radiation intensity of any polarization off the ends of the antenna? 
•  An antenna similar to this was used by Marconi for his first transatlantic broadcast.  
What issues would you face to receive such a broadcast? 
•  What happens if the reflector is tilted relative to the transmitter?  How tilted can it be 
for you to still get a reasonable result? 
If you had a second reflector on the other side of the transmitter, could you create a 
resonant cavity where the reflected waves from each reflector add constructively?  
Would it matter where the transmitter was in the cavity?

Experiment 9: Interference and Diffraction 

 
OBJECTIVES  
 
1.  To explore the diffraction of light through a variety of apertures 
2.  To learn how interference can be used to measure small distances very accurately.  
By  example  we  will  measure  the  wavelength  of  the  laser,  the  spacing  between 
tracks on a CD and the thickness of human hair 

 
WARNING!  The  beam  of  laser  pointers  is  so  concentrated  that  it  can  cause  real 
damage to your retina if you look into the beam either directly or by reflection from 
a shiny object.  Do NOT shine them at others or yourself. 
 

 

PRE-LAB READING 

INTRODUCTION 
 
Electromagnetic  radiation propagates as a wave, and as such can exhibit  interference and 
diffraction.  This is most strikingly seen with laser light, where light shining on a piece of 
paper  looks  speckled  (with  light  and  dark  spots)  rather  than  evenly  illuminated,  and 
where  light  shining  through  a  small  hole makes  a  pattern  of  bright  and  dark  spots  rather 
than  the single spot you might expect  from your everyday experiences with  light.    In  this 
lab  we  will  use  laser  light  to  investigate  the  phenomena  of  interference  and  diffraction 
and  will  see  how  we  can  use  these  phenomena  to  make  accurate  measurements  of  very 
small objects like the spacing between tracks on a CD and the thickness of human hair. 
 
The Details:  Interference 
Consider two traveling waves, moving through space:
Look here as function of time
Constructive 
Interference

The  picture  at  left  forms  the  basis  of  all  the 
phenomena  you  will  observe  in  the  lab.    Two 
different  waves  arrive  at  a  single  position  in 
space (at the screen).  If they are in phase then 
they  add  constructively  and  you  see  a  bright 
spot.    If  they  are  out  of  phase  then  they  add 
destructively and you see nothing (dark spot). 
 
The  key  to  creating  interference  is  creating 
phase  shift  between  two  waves  that  are  then 
brought  together  at  a  single  position.    A  common  way  to  do  that  is  to  add  extra  path 
length  to  one  of  the  waves  relative  to  the  other.    In  this  lab  the  distance  traveled  from 
source  to  screen,  and  hence  the  relative  phase  of  incoming waves,  changes  as  a  function 
of lateral position on the screen, creating a visual interference pattern.

Here  the extra path  length  is 

The  first  phenomenon  we  consider  is  two  slit 
interference.  Light from the laser hits two very 
narrow  slits, which  then  act  like  in-phase  point 
sources  of  light.    In  traveling  from  the  slits  to 
the screen, however, the light from the two slits 
travel  different  distances.    In  the  picture  at  left 
light hitting point P from the bottom slit travels 
further  than  the  light  from  the  top  slit.    This 
extra  path  length  introduces  a  phase  shift 
between  the  two  waves  and  leads  to  a  position 
dependent interference pattern on the screen.

resulting  interference  pattern  lies  in  those  regions 
that  are  neither maxima  or minima  but  rather  in  between.   Here,  because more  incoming 
waves  are  available  to  interfere,  the  interference  becomes  more  destructive,  making  the 
minima  appear  broader  and  the  maxima  sharper.    This  explains  the  appearance  of  a 
brilliant  array  of  colors  that  change  as  a  function of  angle when  looking  at  a CD.   A CD 
has  a  large  number  of  small  grooves,  each  reflecting  light  and  becoming  a  new  source 
like  a  small  slit.    For  a  given  angle,  a  distinct  set  of  wavelengths  will  form  constructive 
maxima when the reflected light reaches your eyes. 
 
Diffraction 

The  next  kind  of  interference we  consider  is  light  going  through  a 
single  slit,  interfering  with  itself.    This  is  called  diffraction,  and 
arises from the finite width of the slit (a in the picture at left).  The 
resultant  effect  is  not  nearly  as  easy  to  derive  as  that  from  two-slit 
interference  (which,  as  you  can  see  from  above,  is  straight-
forward).    The  result  for  the  anglular  locations  of  the  minima  is

Putting it Together 
If  you  have  two wide  slits,  that  is,  slits  that  exhibit  both  diffraction  and  interference,  the 
pattern observed on a distant screen is as follows:  

 
Here  the  amplitude  modulation  (the  red  envelope)  is  set  by  the  diffraction  (the  width  of 
the  slits),  while  the  “individual  wiggles”  are  due  to  the  interference  between  the  light 
coming from the two different slits.  You know that this must be the case because d must 
be  larger  than  a,  and  hence  the  minima  locations,  which  go  like  1/d,  are  closer  together 
for the two slit pattern than for the single slit pattern. 
 
The Opposite of a Slit:  Babinet’s Principle 
 
So  far  we  have  discussed  sending  light  through  very  narrow  slits  or  reflecting  it  off  of 
small grooves,  in each case creating a  series of point-like “new sources” of  light  that can 
then go on and interfere.  Rather amazingly, light hitting a small solid object, like a piece 
of hair, creates  the same  interference pattern as  if  the object were  replaced with a hole of 
the  same  dimensions.    This  idea  is  Babinet’s  Principle,  and  the  reason  behind  it  is 
summed  up  by  the  pictoral  equation  at  right.  
If you add an object to a hole of the same size, 
you  get  a  filled  hole.   EM waves  hitting  those 
objects  must  add  in  the  same  fashion,  that  is, 
the electric fields produced when  light hits  the 
hole,  when  added  to  the  electric  fields  produced  by  the  small  object,  must  add  to  the 
electric fields produced when light hits the filled hole.  Since no light can get through the 
filled hole, Ehole + Eobject = 0.   Thus we find  that  the electric fields coming out of  the hole 
are  equal  and  opposite  to  the  electric  fields  diffracting  off  of  the  small  object.   Since  the 
observed  interference  pattern  depends  on  intensity,  the  square  of  the  electric  field,  the 
hole  and  the  object will  generate  identical  diffraction  patterns.    By measuring  properties 
of  the  diffraction  pattern we  can  thus measure  the width  of  the  small  object.    In  this  lab 
the small object will be a piece of your hair.

APPARATUS 
 
1.  Optical bench 

The optical bench consists of a holder 
for  a  laser  pointer,  a  mount  for  slides 
(which contain  the slits you will shine 
light  through),  and  a  sliding  block  to 
which  you  will  attach  pieces  of  paper 
to  mark  your  observed  interference 
patterns.    Note  that  a  small  ring  can 
be  slid  over  the  button  of  the  laser 
pointer  in  order  to  keep  it  on  while 
you make your measurements. 

 
2.  Slit Slides 
You will be given  two  slides, each  containing  four  sets of  slits  labeled a  through d.   One 
slide  contains  single  slits  with  widths  from  20  µm  to  160  µm.    The  other  slide  contains 
double slits with widths of 40 µm or 80 µm, separated by distances of 250 µm or 500 µm. 
 
 

GENERALIZED PROCEDURE 
 
In  this  lab  you  will  shine  the  light  through  slits,  across  hairs  or  off  of  CDs  and  make 
measurements of the resulting interference pattern.   
 
Part 1: Laser Wavelength 
In  this  part  you  will  measure  the  wavelength  of  the  laser  using  the  two  narrow  double 
slits, and making the measurements that you determine are necessary in pre-lab #1. 
 
Part 2: Diffraction from a CD 
Finally,  you  will  measure  the  width  of  tracks  on  a  CD  by  reflecting  laser  light  off  of  it 
and measuring the resulting diffraction pattern. 
 
Part 3: Thickness of Human Hair 
Next  you will  discover  the  ability  to measure  the  size  of  small  objects  using  diffraction, 
by measuring the width of a human hair.

Experiment 9: Interference and Diffraction 

(b) 

 
Answer these questions on a separate sheet of paper and turn them in before the lab 
 
1.  Measuring the Wavelength of Laser Light 
In the first part of this experiment you will shine a red laser through a pair of narrow slits 
(a = 40 µm)  separated by  a known distance  (you will use both d = 250 µm  and 500 µm) 
and  allow  the  resulting  interference pattern  to  fall on  a  screen  a distance L  away  (L ~  40 
cm).  This set up is as pictured in Fig. 2 (in the “Two Slit Interference” section above). 
 
(a)  Will the center of the pattern (directly between the two holes) be an interference 
minimum or maximum? 
You should be able to easily mark and then measure the locations of the 
interference maxima.  For the sizes given above, will these maxima be roughly 
equally spaced, or will they spread out away from the central peak?  If you find 
that they are equally spaced, note that you can use this to your advantage by 
measuring the distance between distance maxima and dividing by the number of 
intermediate maxima to get an average spacing.  If they spread out, which spacing 
should you use in your measurement to get the most accurate results, one close to 
the center or one farther away? 
Approximately  how  many  interference  maxima  will  you  see  on  one  side  of  the 
pattern  before  their  intensity  is  significantly  reduced  by  diffraction  due  to  the 
finite width a of the slit? 
Derive an equation for calculating the wavelength λ of the laser light from your 
measurement of the distance ∆y between interference maxima.  Make sure that 
you keep a copy of this equation in your notes!  You will need it for the lab. 
In  order  to most  accurately measure  the  distance  between maxima ∆y,  it  helps  to 
have them as far apart as possible.  (Why?)  Assuming that the slit parameters and 
light wavelength are fixed, what can we do in order to make ∆y bigger?  What are 
some reasons that can we not do this ad infinitum? 

 
 
2.  Single Slit Interference 
Now  that  you  have measured  the wavelength  λ  of  the  light  you  are  using,  you will want 
to  measure  the  width  of  some  slits  from  their  diffraction  pattern.    When  measuring 
diffraction  patterns  (as  opposed  to  the  interference  patterns  of  problem  1)  it  is  typically 
easiest to measure between diffraction minima. 
 
(a) 

Derive an equation for calculating  the width a of a slit from your measurement of 
the  distance ∆y  between  diffraction minima.   Make  sure  that  you  keep  a  copy  of 
this  equation  in  your  notes!    You  will  need  it  for  the  lab.    Note  that  this  same 
equation will be used for measuring the thickness of your hair. 
(b)  What is the width of the central maximum (the distance on the screen between the 
m=-1  and  m=1  minima)?    How  does  this  compare  to  the  distance ∆y  between 
other adjacent minima?

In addition  to using hair as a  thin 
object  for  diffraction,  you  can 
also  measure  its  thickness  using 
an  interferometer.    In  fact,  you 
can  use  this  to  measure  even 
smaller  objects.    Its  use  on  a 
small  fiber  is  pictured  at  left.  
The  fiber  is  placed  between  two 
glass  slides,  lifting  one  at  an 
angle  relative  to  the  other.    The 
slides  are  illuminated  with  green 
light  from  above,  and  when  the 
set-up  is  viewed  from  above,  an 
interference  pattern,  pictured  in 
the “Eye View”, appears. 

What is the thickness d of the fiber? 
 
 
 
4.  CD 
In  the  last  part  of  this  lab  you  will  reflect  light  off  of  a  CD  and  measure  the  resulting 
interference pattern on a screen a distance L ~ 5 cm away.   
A  CD  has  a  number  of  tracks,  each  of  width  d  (this  is  what  you  are  going  to 
(a) 
measure).  Each track contains a number of bits, of length l ~ d/3.  Approximately 
how  many  bits  are  there  on  a  CD?    In  case  you  didn’t  know,  CDs  sample  two 
channels (left and right) at a rate of 44100 samples/second, with a resolution of 16 
bits/sample.    In  addition  to  the  actual  data  bits,  there  are  error  correction  and 
packing bits that roughly double the number of bits on the CD. 
(b)  What,  approximately,  must  the  track  width  be  in  order  to  accommodate  this 
number  of  bits  on  a  CD?    In  case  you  don’t  have  a  ruler,  a  CD  has  an  inner 
diameter of 40 mm and an outer diameter of 120 mm. 
Derive  an  equation  for  calculating  the  width  d  of  the  tracks  from  your 
measurement  of  the  distance ∆y  between  interference  maxima.    Make  sure  that 
you keep a copy of this equation in your notes!  You will need it for the lab. 
Using  the  previous  results,  what  approximately  will  the  distance  between 
interference maxima ∆y be on the screen?

MEASUREMENTS 
 
Part 1: Laser Wavelength 
In this part you will measure the wavelength λ of the laser light you are using 
1.  Set up the optical bench as pictured in the apparatus diagram.   
a.  Clip paper onto the wooden slide, and place roughly 40 cm away from the 
slide holder 
b.  Place  the  double  slit  slide  in  the  slide  holder  and  align  so  that  light  from 
the laser goes through slit pattern a. 
c.  Turn the laser on (lock it with the clip that slides around the on button) 
d.  Adjust  the  location of  the wooden slide so  that  the pattern  is visible but as 
large as possible 
2.  Mark  the  locations  of  the  intensity  maxima.    If  they  are  too  close  to  measure 
individually, mark of a set of them and determine the average spacing. 

 
Question 1: 
What  distance  between  the  slide  and  the  screen  did  you  use?    What  was  the  average 
distance ∆y between maxima?

Part 2: Diffraction from a CD 
In  this  part  you  will  determine  the  track  width  on  a  CD  by  measuring  the  distance 
between interference maxima generated by light reflected from it.   
1.  Remove the slide from in front of the laser pointer 
2.  Clip a card with a hole in it to the back of the wooden slide. 
3.  Place  a  CD  in  the  groove  in  the  back  of  the  wooden  slider.    Light  will  pass 
through the hole in the slider and card, reflect off the CD, and land on the card. 
4.  Turn on the laser and measure the distance between interference maxima.

Part 3: Thickness of Human Hair 
Now you will measure the thickness of a human hair using diffraction.   
1.  Remove  the  CD  and  card  from  the  wooden  slide,  and  tape  some  hair  across  the 
hole (the hair should run vertically as pictured below). 
2.  Clip a card to the block at the end of the apparatus. 
3.  Shine  the  laser  on  the  hair,  and  adjust  the  distance  between  the  hair  and  the  card 
so that you obtain a useable diffraction pattern. 
 
Question 4: 
What is the thickness of the hair that 
you  measure? 
  Does  this  seem 
reasonable? 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Further Questions (for experiment, thought, future exam questions…) 
 
• 

• 

Instead of measuring the wavelength of light from the two slit patterns, you could 
have instead used single slits.  Would that have been more or less accurate?  Why? 
•  Why did you use two slit patterns a to measure the light wavelength rather than 
pattern d. 
•  Where does most of the measurement error come from?  How would you improve 
this in future labs? 
If we redid these experiments with a blue laser instead of red, what changes would 
you have needed to make?  Would it have affected the accuracy of the measurements? 
•  Does the track width change as a function of location on the CD?  If so, is it larger or 
smaller near the outside? 
•  What is the ratio of the track size to the wavelength of the light that you used (which 
is very similar to the wavelength of light used in commercial players)? 
•  What would happen to the diffraction pattern if the track width was smaller? 
•  Why are people anxious to move to blue lasers in commercial CD and DVD players?
