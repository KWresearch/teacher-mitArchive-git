PRE-LAB READING 

INTRODUCTION 
 
When  a  battery  is  connected  to  a  circuit  consisting  of  wires  and  other  circuit  elements 
like resistors and capacitors,  voltages can develop across those elements and currents can 
flow through them.   In this lab we will investigate three types of circuits: those with only 
resistors  in  them  and  those with  resistors  and  either  capacitors  (RC  circuits)  or  inductors 
(RL circuits).   We will confirm that there is a linear relationship between current through 
and potential difference across  resistors  (Ohm’s  law:   V =  IR).   We will also measure  the 
very  different  relationship  between  current  and  voltage  in  a  capacitor  and  an  inductor, 
and study the time dependent behavior of RC and RL circuits. 
 
The Details:  Measuring Voltage and Current 
 
Imagine  you wish  to measure  the  voltage  drop  across  and  current  through  a  resistor  in  a 
circuit.    To  do  so,  you  would  use  a  voltmeter  and  an  ammeter  –  similar  devices  that 
measure  the amount of current  flowing  in one  lead,  through  the device, and out  the other 
lead.   But  they  have  an  important  difference.   An  ammeter  has  a  very  low  resistance,  so 
when  placed  in  series with  the  resistor,  the  current measured  is  not  significantly  affected 
(Fig.  1a).   A  voltmeter,  on  the  other  hand,  has  a  very  high  resistance,  so when  placed  in 
parallel  with  the  resistor  (thus  seeing  the  same  voltage  drop)  it  will  draw  only  a  very 
small amount of current  (which  it can convert  to voltage using Ohm’s Law VR = Vmeter = 
ImeterRmeter), and again will not appreciably change the circuit (Fig. 1b).

through  the  resistor  (a)  the  ammeter  is  placed  in  series  with  it.    To  measure  the  voltage 
drop across the resistor (b) the voltmeter is placed in parallel with it.

The Details:  Capacitors 
 
Capacitors  store  charge,  and  develop  a  voltage  drop  V  across  them  proportional  to  the 
amount of charge Q that they have stored:  V = Q/C.  The constant of proportionality C is 
the  capacitance  (measured  in  Farads  =  Coulombs/Volt),  and  determines  how  easily  the 
capacitor can store charge.  Typical circuit capacitors range from picofarads (1 pF = 10-12 
F)  to millifarads  (1 mF  =  10-3  F).    In  this  lab we will  use microfarad  capacitors  (1  µF  = 
10-6 F). 
 
RC Circuits 
 
Consider  the  circuit  shown  in  Figure  2.  The  capacitor  (initially  uncharged)  is  connected

In  class  we  derived  expressions  for  the  time-dependent  charge  on,  voltage  across,  and 
current  through  the  capacitor,  but  even  without  solving  differential  equations  a  little 
thought  should  allow  us  to  get  a  good  idea  of  what  happens.    Initially  the  capacitor  is 
uncharged  and  hence  has  no  voltage  drop  across  it  (it  acts  like  a wire  or  “short  circuit”).  
This  means  that  the  full  voltage  rise  of  the  battery  is  dropped  across  the  resistor,  and 
hence current must be flowing  in  the circuit (VR = IR).   As  time goes on,  this current will 
“charge  up”  the  capacitor  –  the  charge  on  it  and  the  voltage  drop  across  it will  increase, 
and hence  the voltage drop across  the  resistor and  the current  in  the circuit will decrease.  
This idea is captured in the graphs of Fig. 3.

After the capacitor is “fully charged,” with its voltage essentially equal to the voltage of the 
battery, the capacitor acts like a break in the wire or “open circuit,” and the current is 
essentially zero.  Now we “shut off” the battery (replace it with a wire).  The capacitor will 
then release its charge, driving current through the circuit.  In this case, the voltage across 
the capacitor and across the resistor are equal, and hence charge, voltage and current all do 
the same thing, decreasing with time.  As you saw in class, this decay is exponential, 
characterized by a time constant t, as pictured in fig. 4.

The Details:  Inductors 
 
Inductors  store  energy  in  the  form  of  an  internal  magnetic  field,  and  find  their  behavior 
dominated by Faraday’s Law.  In any circuit in which they are placed they create an EMF 
ε  proportional  to  the  time  rate  of  change  of  current  I  through  them:   ε  =  L  dI/dt.    The 
constant  of  proportionality  L  is  the  inductance  (measured  in  Henries  =  Ohm  s),  and 
determines  how  strongly  the  inductor  reacts  to  current  changes  (and  how  large  a  self 
energy  it contains  for a given current).   Typical circuit  inductors  range  from nanohenries 
to  hundreds  of  millihenries.    The  direction  of  the  induced  EMF  can  be  determined  by 
Lenz’s Law:  it will always oppose the change (inductors try to keep the current constant) 
 
RL Circuits

current  flows  in  the  circuit.    At  t=0  the  switch  is  closed 
and current I can begin to flow, as indicated by the arrow. 
.

 

E06-3

As  we  saw  in  class,  before  the  switch  is  closed  there  is  no  current  in  the  circuit.   When 
the switch is closed the inductor wants to keep the same current as an instant ago – none.  
Thus it will set up an EMF that opposes the current flow.  At first the EMF is identical to 
that of  the battery  (but  in  the opposite direction) and no current will  flow.   Then, as  time 
passes, the inductor will gradually relent and current will begin to flow.  After a long time 
a  constant  current  (I  =  V/R)  will  flow  through  the  inductor,  and  it  will  be  content  (no 
changing current means no changing B  field means no changing magnetic  flux means no 
EMF).  The resulting EMF and current are pictured in Fig. 6.

Figure 6  (a) “EMF generated by the inductor” decreases with time (this is what a 
voltmeter hooked in parallel with the inductor would show) (b) the current and hence the 
voltage across the resistor increase with time, as the inductor ‘relaxes.’ 
 
After the inductor is “fully charged,” with the current essentially constant, we can shut off 
the battery (replace it with a wire).  Without an inductor in the circuit the current would 
instantly drop to zero, but the inductor does not want this rapid change, and hence 
generates an EMF that will, for a moment, keep the current exactly the same as it was 
before the battery was shut off.  In this case, the EMF generated by the inductor and 
voltage across the resistor are equal, and hence EMF, voltage and current all do the same 
thing, decreasing exponentially with time as pictured in fig. 7.

The Details:  Non-Ideal Inductors 
So far we have always assumed that circuit elements are ideal, for example, that inductors 
only  have  inductance  and  not  capacitance  or  resistance.    This  is  generally  a  decent 
assumption,  but  in  reality  no  circuit  element  is  truly  ideal,  and  today  we  will  need  to 
consider  this.    In  particular,  today’s  “inductor”  has  both  inductance  and  resistance  (real 
inductor =  ideal  inductor  in  series with  resistor).   Although  there  is no way  to physically 
separate  the  inductor  from  the  resistor  in  this circuit element, with a  little  thought (which 
you will do in the pre-lab) you will be able to measure both the resistance and inductance.  
 
APPARATUS 
 
1.  Science Workshop 750 Interface 
 
In  this  lab  we  will  again  use  the  Science  Workshop  750  interface  to  create  a  “variable 
battery” which we  can  turn  on  and  off, whose  voltage we  can  change  and whose  current 
we can measure. 
 
2. AC/DC Electronics Lab Circuit Board 
We will also use, for the first of several times, the circuit board pictured in Fig. 8.  This is 
a  general  purpose  board,  with  (A)  battery  holders,  (B)  light  bulbs,  (C)  a  push  button 
switch, (D) a variable resistor called a potentiometer, and (E) an  inductor.   It also has (F) 
a  set  of  8  isolated  pads with  spring  connectors  that  circuit  components  like  resistors  and 
capacitors can easily be pushed into.  Each pad has two spring connectors connected by a 
wire  (as  indicated  by  the  white  lines).    The  right-most  pads  also  have  banana  plug 
receptacles, which we will use to connect to the output of the 750.

3. Current & Voltage Sensors 
 
Recall  that  both  current  and  voltage  sensors  follow  the  convention  that  red  is  “positive” 
and black “negative.”   That  is,  the current sensor  records currents  flowing  in  the  red  lead 
and  out  the  black  as  positive.    The  voltage  sensor  measures  the  potential  at  the  red  lead 
minus that at the black lead.

4. Resistors & Capacitors 
 
We  will  work  with  resistors  and  capacitors  in  this  lab.    Resistors  (Fig.  8a)  have  color 
bands  that  indicate  their  value  (see  appendix  A  if  you  are  interested  in  learning  to  read 
this code), whereas capacitors (Fig. 8b) are typically stamped with a numerical value.

resistors  look  the  same,  with  4  or  5  colored  bands  indicating  the  resistance.  
Capacitors  on  the  other  hand  come  in  a  wide  variety  of  packages  and  are  typically 
stamped both with their capacitance and with a maximum working voltage.

GENERALIZED PROCEDURE 
 
This lab consists of five main parts.  In each you will set up a circuit and measure voltage 
and  current while  the  battery  periodically  turns  on  and  off.    In  the  last  two  parts  you  are 
encouraged  to  develop  your  own  methodology  for  measuring  the  resistance  and 
inductance of the coil on the AC/DC Electronics Lab Circuit Board both with and without 
a  core  inserted.   The  core  is  a metal  cylinder which  is  designed  to  slide  into  the  coil  and 
affect its properties in some way that you will measure. 
 
Part 1: Measure Voltage Across & Current Through a Resistor 
Here  you  will  measure  the  voltage  drop  across  and  current  through  a  single  resistor 
attached to the output of the 750. 
 
Part 2: Resistors in Parallel 
Now  attach  a  second  resistor  in  parallel  to  the  first  and  see  what  happens  to  the  voltage 
drop across and current through the first. 
 
Part 3: Measuring Voltage and Current in an RC Circuit 
In  this part you will create a series RC (resistor/capacitor) circuit with  the battery  turning 
on  and  off  so  that  the  capacitor  charges  then  discharges.    You  will  measure  the  time 
constant  in  two  different  ways  (see  Pre-Lab  #5)  and  use  this  measurement  to  determine 
the capacitance of the capacitor. 
 
Part 4: Measure Resistance and Inductance Without a Core 
The battery will alternately  turn on and  turn off.   You will need  to hook up  this source  to 
the  coil  and,  by  measuring  the  voltage  supplied  by  and  current  through  the  battery, 
determine the resistance and inductance of the coil. 
 
Part 5: Measure Resistance and Inductance With a Core 
In this section you will insert a core into the coil and repeat your measurements from part 
1 (or choose a different way to make the measurements).

Experiment 6: Ohm’s Law, RC and RL Circuits 

 
Answer these questions on a separate sheet of paper and turn them in before the lab 
 
1.   Measuring Voltage and Current 
 
In Part 1 of this experiment you will measure the potential drop across and current 
through a single resistor attached to the “variable battery.”  On a diagram similar to the 
one below, indicate where you will attach the leads to the resistor, the battery, the voltage 
V 
A
sensor 
, and the current sensor 
.  For the battery and sensors make sure that you 
indicate which color lead goes where, using the convention that red is “high” (or the 
positive input) and black is “ground.”  Reread the pre-lab description of this board 
carefully to understand the various parts.  When you draw a resistor or other circuit 
element it should go between two pads (dark green areas) with each end touching one of 
the spring clips (the metal coils).  Do NOT just draw a typical circuit diagram.  You need 
to think about how you will actually wire this board during the lab.  RECALL:  ammeters 
must be in series with the element they are measuring current through, while voltmeters 
must be in parallel. 
 

 
 
2.  Resistors in Parallel 
 
In Part 2 you will add a second resistor  in parallel with  the first.   Show where you would 
attach  this  second  resistor  in  the  diagram  you  drew  for  question  1,  making  sure  that  the 
ammeter  continues  to  measure  the  current  through  the  first  resistor  and  the  voltmeter 
measures the voltage across the first resistor. 
 

 

 

E06-9

3.  Measuring the Time Constant τ 
 
As you have seen, current always decays exponentially in RC circuits with a time 
constant τ:  I = I0 exp(-t/τ). 
 
We will measure this time constant in two different ways. 
 
(a)  After measuring the current as a function of 
time we choose two points on the curve 
(t1,I1) and (t2, I2).  What relationship must 
we choose between I2 and I1 in order to 
determine the time constant by subtraction:  
τ = t2 – t1?  Should we be able to find a t2 
that satisfies this for any choice of t1?

(b)  We can also plot the natural log of the 
current vs. time, as shown at right. If we fit 
a line to this curve we will obtain a slope m 
and a y-intercept b.  From these fitting 
parameters, how can we calculate the time 
constant? 

 
 
(c)  Which of these two methods is more likely 
to help us obtain an accurate measurement 
of the time constant?  Why?

Make  sure  that  you  record  your  answers  to  question  3  in  your 
notes as you will need them for the lab. 
 
 
4.  RL Circuits 

Consider the circuit at left, consisting of a battery (emf 
ε), an inductor L, resistor R and switch S. 
 
For times t<0 the switch is open and there is no current 
in the circuit.  At t=0 the switch is closed. 
 
(a) 
Using Kirchhoff’s loop rules (really Faraday’s 
law now), write an equation relating the emf on the 
battery, the current in the circuit and the time 
derivative of the current in the circuit. 

E06-10

In class we stated that this equation was solved by an exponential.  In other words: 
I = A(X – exp(-t/τ)) 

 
(b) 

(c) 

 
Plug this expression into the differential equation you obtained in (a) in order to 
confirm that it indeed is a solution and to determine what the time constant τ and 
the constants A and X are.  What would be a better label for A?  (HINT:  You will 
also need to use the initial condition for current.  What is I(t=0)?). 
Now  that  you  know  the  time  dependence  for  the  current  I  in  the  circuit  you  can 
also  determine  the  voltage  drop VR  across  resistor  and  the  EMF  generated  by  the 
inductor.   Do  so,  and  confirm  that  your  expressions match  the  plots  in  Fig.  6a  or 
2b. 

 
 
5.  ‘Discharging’ an Inductor 
 
After  a  long  time  T  the  current  will  reach  an  equilibrium 
value and inductor will be “fully charged.”  At this point we 
turn  off  the  battery  (ε=0),  allowing  the  inductor  to 
‘discharge,’ as pictured at left.  Repeat each of the steps a-c 
instead  of  exp(-t/τ),  our 
in  problem  4,  noting 
that 
expression for current will now contain exp(-(t-T)/τ).   
 

 
 
6.  The Coil 
 
The  coil  you will  be measuring  has  is made  of  thin  copper wire  (radius  ~  0.25 mm)  and 
has  about  600  turns  of  average  diameter  25  mm  over  a  length  of  25  mm.    What 
approximately  should  the  resistance  and  inductance  of  the  coil  be?    The  resistivity  of 
copper at  room  temperature  is around 20 nΩ-m.   Note  that your calculations  can only be 
approximate because this is not at all an ideal solenoid (where length >> diameter). 

 

E06-11

7.  A Real Inductor 
 
As mentioned above, in this lab you will work with a coil that does not behave as an ideal 
inductor, but rather as an ideal inductor in series with a resistor.  For this reason you have 
no way to independently measure the voltage drop across the resistor or the EMF induced 
by the inductor, but instead must measure them together.  None-the-less, you want to get 
information about both.  In this problem you will figure out how. 
 
 (a)  In the lab you will hook up the circuit of problem 4 with the ideal inductor L of that 
problem now replaced by a coil that is a non-ideal inductor – an inductor L and 
resistor r in series.  The battery will periodically turn on and off, displaying a voltage 
as shown here:

Sketch the current through the battery as well as what a voltmeter hooked across the 
coil would show versus time for the two periods shown above.  Assume that the 
period of the battery turning off and on is comparable to but longer than several time 
constants of the circuit.  

 
(b)  How can you tell from your plot of the voltmeter across the coil that the coil is not 
an ideal inductor?  Indicate the relevant feature clearly on the plot.  Can you 
determine the resistance of the coil, r, from this feature? 

 
(c)  In the lab you will find it easier to make measurements if you do NOT use an 
additional resistor R, but instead simply hook the battery directly to the coil.  (Why? 
Because the time constant is difficult to measure with extra resistance in the circuit).  
Plot the current through the battery and the reading on a voltmeter across the coil for 
this case.  We will only bother to measure the current.  Why? 

 
(d)  For this case (only a battery & coil) how will you determine the resistance of the 
coil, r?  How will you determine its inductance L? 

 
 
Make  sure  that  you  record  your  answer  to  7d  in  your  notes  as 
you will need it for the lab.

Using  one  of  the  two methods  used  above, what  is  the  time  constant  of  this  new  circuit?  
What must the resistance of the second resistor be? 
 
 
 
 
Part 4: Measure Resistance and Inductance Without a Core 
1.  Connect  cables  from  the  output  of  the  750  to  either  side  of  the  coil  (using  the 
clips) 
2.  Make sure that the core is removed from the coil 
3.  Record  the  current  through  and  voltage  across  the  battery  for  a  fraction  of  a 
second. (Press the green “Go” button above the graph). 

 
Question 7: 
What  is  the  maximum  current  during  the  cycle?    What  is  the  EMF  generated  by  the 
inductor at the time this current is reached? 
 
 
 
 
Question 8: 
What is the time constant τ of the circuit?

Question 9: 
What are  the  resistance r and  inductance L of  the coil?   Calculate  this using your answer 
to Pre-Lab #7d. 
 
 
 
Part 5: Measure Resistance and Inductance With a Core 
1.  Insert the core into the center of the coil 
2.  Record  the  current  through  and  voltage  across  the  battery  for  a  fraction  of  a 
second. (Press the green “Go” button above the graph).   

 
Question 10: 
Does the maximum current in the circuit change due to the introduction of the core?  If it 
does,  try  to explain as clearly as possible why  this happens  (including why  the change  to 
bigger or smaller makes sense) 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 11: 
Does  the  time  constant τ  of  the  circuit  change  due  to  the  introduction  of  the  core?    If  it 
does,  try  to explain as clearly as possible why  this happens  (including why  the change  to 
longer or shorter makes sense) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 12: 
What are the new resistance r and inductance L of the coil?

Further Questions (for experiment, thought, future exam questions…) 
 
•  What happens if we instead put the second resistor in parallel with the first? 
•  What if we instead put the second resistor in parallel with the capacitor?  Does the 
initial current change?  The final current?  The final voltage (and hence charge) on 
the capacitor? 
•  What if we change the order of the elements in the circuit (e.g. put the capacitor 
between the two resistors, or switch the leads from the battery)? 
•  The ammeter is marked as having a 1 ohm resistance, small, but not tiny.  Can you 
see the effects of the ammeter resistance in the circuits of part 1 and 2?  Can you 
measure the voltage drop across the ammeter?  Does this make the measurement of 
the current through the resistor inaccurate? 
•  What happens if we put a resistor R in series with the coil?  In parallel with the coil? 
•  What happens if you make the battery switch on and off with a period shorter than the 
time constant of the circuit?  Would you still be able to determine the inductance L 
and resistance r of the coil using the same method? 
•  What happens if you only partially insert the core into the coil?  Can you 
continuously adjust the core’s effects or there an abrupt jump from one behavior to 
another?  Would another core (like your finger) have the same effects? 
If the coil were made of some superconducting material, what would its resistance 
be?  Would the EMF you measure be any different?  Would the potential difference

from one side of the inductor to the other  (
(cid:71)  be any different?
