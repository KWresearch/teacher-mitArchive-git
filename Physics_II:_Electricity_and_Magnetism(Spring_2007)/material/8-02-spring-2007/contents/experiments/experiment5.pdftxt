Experiment 5: Faraday’s Law 

 
OBJECTIVES  
 
1.  To  become  familiar  with  the  concepts  of  changing  magnetic  flux  and  induced 
current associated with Faraday’s Law of Induction. 

2.  To  see  how  and why  the  direction  of  the magnetic  force  on  a  conductor  carrying 
an  induced  current  is  consistent  with  Lenz’s  Law.    Lenz’s  Law  says  that  the 
system always responds so as to try to keep things the same.

PRE-LAB READING 

 

INTRODUCTION 
 
In  this  lab  you  will  develop  an  intuition  for  Faraday’s  and  Lenz’s  Laws.    By  moving  a 
coil of wire over a magnet you will change the magnetic flux through the coil, generating 
and EMF and hence current in the loop which you will measure using the 750. 
 
The Details:  Faraday’s Law 
 
Faraday’s  Law  states  that  a  changing  magnetic  flux  generates  an  EMF  (electromotive 
force).  Mathematically:

In  each  of  the  cases  pictured  above,  the  magnetic  flux  into  the  page  is  decreasing  with 
time  (because  the  (1)  B  field,  (2)  loop  area  or  (3)  projected  area  are  decreasing  with 
time).    This  decreasing  flux  creates  an  EMF.    In  which  direction?    We  can  use  Lenz’s 
Law to find out. 
 
Lenz’s Law 
Lenz’s Law  is a non-mathematical statement of Faraday’s Law.    It says  that systems will 
always act  to oppose  changes  in magnetic  flux.   For  example,  in  each of  the  above  cases 
the flux into the page is decreasing with time.  The loop doesn’t want a decreased flux, so 
it will generate a clockwise EMF, which will drive a clockwise current, creating a B field 
into  the  page  (inside  the  loop)  to  make  up  for  the  lost  flux.    This,  by  the  way,  is  the 
meaning  of  the  minus  sign  in  Faraday’s  law.    I  recommend  that  you  use  Lenz’s  Law  to 
determine  the  direction  of  the  EMF  and  then  use  Faraday’s  Law  to  calculate  the 
amplitude.   By  the way,  just  as with Faraday’s Law, you don’t need  a physical  circuit  to 
use Lenz’s Law.   Just pretend  that  there  is a wire  in which current could flow and ask    in 
what direction  it would need  to flow  to oppose  the changing flux.   In general, opposing a 
change  in  flux  means  opposing  what  is  happening  to  change  the  flux  (e.g.  forces  or 
torques oppose the change). 
 
 
APPARATUS 
 
1. Magnet Stand 
 
The magnetic flux of Faraday’s Law will be generated by a high field permanent magnet, 
sitting on a support beam so that you may move a coil from above to below and back.

2. Wire Loop, Current Sensor and Science Workshop 750 Interface 
 
The  magnetic  field  will  penetrate  a  loop  of  wire,  which  you  will  plug  into  the  current 
sensor,  which  is  in  turn  plugged  into  channel  A  of  the  750.    In  this  lab  we  will  use  the 
convention  that  positive  current  flows  counter-clockwise  when  observed  from  above.  
The  current  sensor  records  current  that  flows  into  its  red  terminal  and  out  its  negative 
terminal as positive, so make sure  that you hook up  the wire  to  the current  sensor  so  that 
these two conventions are compatible with each other.

GENERALIZED PROCEDURE 
 
This  lab  consists  of  two  parts.    In  each  you will  observe  the  effects  (current &  force)  of 
moving a loop around a dipole. 
 
Part 1: Current and Flux through a Loop Moving Past a Dipole 
You will move  a wire  loop  from  above  to below  a magnetic dipole,  and observe plots of 
the  current  flowing  through  the  loop  (measured)  and  the  flux  through  the  loop 
(calculated). 
 
Part 2: Feeling the Force 
In  this  part  you will  repeat  the motion,  using  a  hollow  aluminum  cylinder  instead  of  the 
wire  loop.    In  doing  so  you  will  be  able  to  feel  the  force  on  the  cylinder  due  to  Lenz’s 
Law.

Experiment 5: Faraday’s Law 

 
Answer these questions on a separate sheet of paper and turn them in before the lab 
 
 
1.   Calculating Flux from Current and Faraday’s Law 
 
In  part  1  of  this  lab  you  will  move  a  coil  from  well  above  to  well  below  a  strong 
permanent magnet.   You will measure  the  current  in  the  loop  during  this motion  using  a 
current sensor.  The program will also display the flux “measured” through the loop, even 
though this value is never directly measured.  In this problem you will understand how. 
 
(a) 
Starting from Faraday’s Law and Ohm’s law, write an equation relating the 
current in the loop to the time derivative of the flux through the loop. 
 
(b) 
Now integrate that expression to get the time dependence of the flux through the 
loop Φ(t) as a function of current I(t).  What assumption must the software make (what 
value must it arbitrarily set) before it can plot flux vs. time? 
 
2.   Predictions:  Coil Moving Past Magnetic Dipole 
 
In moving the coil over the magnet, measurements of current and flux for each of several 
motions  will  look  like  one  of  the  below  plots.    For  current,  counter-clockwise  when 
viewed  from  above  is  positive.    For  flux,  upwards  is  positive.    The  north  pole  of  the 
magnet is pointing up.

Suppose  you  move  the  loop  from  well  above  the  magnet  to  well  below  the  magnet  at  a 
constant speed.  Which graph most closely resembles the graph of: 
(a)  magnetic flux through the loop as a function of time? 
(b)  current through the loop as a function of time?

2.   Predictions:  Coil Moving Past Magnetic Dipole continued 
 
Suppose you now move the loop from well below the magnet to well above the magnet at 
a constant speed.  Which graph most closely resembles the graph of: 
(c)  magnetic flux through the loop as a function of time? 
(d)  current through the loop as a function of time? 
 
3.   Predictions:  Force on Coil Moving Past Magnetic Dipole 
 
In  part  2  of  this  lab  you  will  feel  the  force  on  a  conducting  loop  as  it  moves  past  the 
magnet.  For the following conditions, in what direction should the magnetic force point?   
 
As  you  are  moving  the  loop  from  well  above  the  magnet  to  well  below  the  magnet  at  a 
constant speed… 
(a) … and the loop is above the magnet. 
(b) … and the loop is below the magnet 
 
As  you  are  moving  the  loop  from  well  below  the  magnet  to  well  above  the  magnet  at  a 
constant speed… 
(c) … and the loop is below the magnet. 
(d) … and the loop is above the magnet 
 
Make  sure  that  you  record  your  answers  to  the  previous  two 
problems asking for predictions as you will need them in the lab. 
 
4. Feeling the Force 
 
In  part  2,  rather  than  using  the  same  coil  we  use  in  part  1,  we  will  instead  use  an 
aluminum  cylinder  to  “better  feel”  the  force.   What  possible  differences  could make  the 
cylinder work  better  than  the  coil?    If we were  to  double  the  number  of  turns  in  the  coil 
would  we  be  more  likely  to  be  able  to  feel  the  force,  less  likely,  or  would  there  be  no 
difference?    In  case  you  are  interested,  the  wire  is  copper,  and  of  roughly  the  same 
diameter  as  the  thickness  of  the  aluminum  cylinder,  although  this  information  won’t 
necessarily  help  you  in  answering  the  question.    (HINT:    Write  down  the  equation  for 
force on a current in a magnetic field)

IN-LAB ACTIVITIES 
 
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
 
1.  Download the LabView file and start up the program. 
2.  Connect the current sensor to channel A of the 750. 
3.  Connect  the wire  loop  to  the  current  sensor  so  that,  starting at  the black  terminal,  the 
wire  loops  counterclockwise  (when  viewed  from  above)  and  then  enters  the  red 
terminal of the current sensor 

 
MEASUREMENTS 
Part 1: Current and Flux through a Loop Moving Past a Dipole 
1.  Press ‘Go’ to start recording current and flux 
2.  Move  the  wire  loop  from  well  above  to  well  below  the  magnet  and  back  again.  
Try to make the motion as smooth as possible and at a constant velocity. 

 
Question 1: 
Did  your  measurements  agree  with  your  predictions?    If  not,  which  predictions  did  you 
miss and why? 
 
 
 
Part 2: Feeling the Force 
Although  we  could  do  this  part  of  the  lab  with  the  same  coil  we  just  used,  in  order  to 
better feel the force we will instead use an aluminum tube. 
1.  First hold the aluminum tube near the side of the magnet to convince yourself that 
Al is non-magnetic. 
2.  Place the tube over the Plexiglas and then push the tube downwards. 
3.  When you get to the bottom, pull the tube back up. 

 
Question 2: 
Did  your  measurements  agree  with  your  predictions?    If  not,  which  predictions  did  you 
miss and why?

Further Questions (for experiment, thought, future exam questions…) 
 
•  What happens if you move the coil more quickly?  Does the magnitude of the current 
change?  Does the magnitude of the flux change?  In part 2, does the force change? 
If the current, flux or force do not change in this situation, is there anything we could 
do to make them change?  If they do change, what other changes could we make that 
would counter-act the change of moving more quickly? 
•  What happens to the force when the tube is exactly centered on the magnet?  Why? 
•  Do the effects depend on history?  In other words, is moving from the middle to the 
bottom any different if the motion started at the top than if it started at the bottom and 
reversed at the middle? 
•  What happens if we define the direction of positive current to be clockwise (in other 
words, if we flip the coil over)?  Does this change have any affect on our definition of 
flux?
