Experiment 3: Magnetic Fields of a Bar Magnet and Helmholtz Coil 

 
OBJECTIVES  
 
1.  To learn how to visualize magnetic field lines using compasses and a gauss meter 
2.  To examine the field lines from bar magnets and see how they add 
3.  To  examine  the  field  lines  from  a  Helmholtz  coil  and  understand  the  difference 
between using it in Helmholtz and anti-Helmholtz configurations. 
 

 

PRE-LAB READING 

INTRODUCTION 
 
In  this  lab  we  will  measure  magnetic  field  lines  using  two  methods.    First,  we  will  use 
small  compasses  that  show  the  direction,  but  not magnitude,  of  the  local magnetic  field.  
Next  we  will  use  a  gauss  meter,  which  measures  the  magnitude  of  the  magnetic  field 
along  a  single,  specific  axis  and  thus  does  not  allow  as  easy  a  visualization  of  the 
magnetic  field  direction.    We  will  measure  fields  both  from  bar  magnets  and  from  a 
Helmholtz coil. 
 
APPARATUS 
 
1.  Mini-Compass 
You  will  receive  a  bag  of  mini-compasses  (Fig.  1a)  that  indicate  the  magnetic  field 
direction  by  aligning  with  it,  with  the  painted  end  of  the  compass  needle  pointing  away 
from magnetic  north  (i.e.  pointing  in  the  direction  of  the magnetic  field).   Conveniently, 
the  magnetic  south  pole  of  the  Earth  is  very  close  to  its  geographic  north  pole,  so 
compasses  tend  to  point  North  (Fig.  1b).    Note  that  these  compasses  are  cheap  (though 
not  necessary  inexpensive)  and  sometimes  either  point  in  the  direction  opposite  the way 
they should, or get completely stuck.  Check them out before using them.

2.  Science Workshop 750 Interface 
 
As  always,  we  will  use  the  Science Workshop  750  interface,  this  time  for  recording  the 
magnetic field magnitude as measured by the magnetic field sensor (gauss meter). 
 
3. Magnetic Field Sensor 
The magnetic field sensor measures the strength of the magnetic field pointing into one of 
two  white  dots  painted  at  its  measurement  end  (far  left  in  Fig.  2).    Selecting  “radial” 
mode  records  the  strength  of  the  field  pointing  into  the  dot  on  the  side  of  the  device, 
while  “axial”  records  the  strength  of  the  field  pointing  into  the  dot  on  the  end.    There  is 
also a tare button which sets the current field strength to zero (i.e. measures relative to it). 

 
Figure  2 Magnetic  field  sensor, showing (from right  to  left)  the range select switch,  the 
tare button, and the radial/axial switch, which is set to radial. 
 
4. Helmholtz Coil 
 
Consider  the Helmholtz Coil Apparatus  shown  in Fig. 3.    It  consists of  two  coaxial  coils 
separated  by  a  distance  equal  to  their  common  radii.    The  coil  can  be  operated  in  3 
modes.    In  the  first,  connections  are  made  only  to  one  set  of  banana  plugs,  pushing 
current  through  only  one  of  the  coils.    In  the  second,  a  connection  is  made  between  the 
black  plug  from  one  coil  to  the  red  plug  from  the  other.    This  sends  current  the  same 
direction  through  both  coils  and  is  called  “Helmholtz Mode.”    In  the  final  configuration 
“Anti-Helmholtz  Mode”  a  connection  is  made  between  the  two  black  plugs,  sending 
current in the opposite direction through the two coils.

4. Power Supply 
 
Because  the Helmholtz coils  require a  fairly  large current  in order  to create a measurable 
field, we  are  unable  to  use  the  output  of  the  750  to  drive  them.    For  this  reason, we will 
use an EZ dc power supply (Fig. 4).  This supply limits both the voltage  and the current, 
putting out the largest voltage possible consistent with both settings.  That is, if the output 
is  open  (no  leads  connected,  so  no  current)  then  the  voltage  output  is  completely 
determined  by  the  voltage  setting.    On  the  other  hand,  if  the  output  is  shorted  (a  wire  is 
placed  between  the  two  output  plugs)  then  the  voltage  is  completely  determined  by  the 
current setting (V = IRshort). 
 

 

 

E03-3

Figure 4 Power Supply for Helmholtz Coil 
The  power  supply  allows  independent  control 
of  current  (left  knob)  and  voltage  (right  knob) 
with  whichever  limits  the  output  the  most  in 
control.    The  green  light  next  to  the  “CV”  in 
this  picture  means  that  we  are  in  “constant 
voltage” mode –  the voltage  setting  is  limiting 
the  output  (which  makes  sense  since  the 
output  at  the  bottom  right  is  not  hooked  up  so 
there is currently no current flow). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

GENERALIZED PROCEDURE 
 
This  lab  consists  of  three  main  parts.    In  each  you  will  measure  the  magnetic  field 
generated either by bar magnets or by current carrying coils. 
 
Part 1: Mapping Magnetic Field Lines Using Mini-Compasses 
Using a compass you will follow a series of field lines originating near the north pole of a 
bar magnet. 
 
Part 2: Constructing a Magnetic Field Diagram 
A  pair  of  bar  magnets  are  placed  so  that  either  their  opposite  poles  or  same  poles  are 
facing each other and you will map out the field lines from these configurations. 
 
Part 3: Helmholtz Coil 
In  this  part  you  will  use  the  magnetic  field  sensor  to  measure  the  amplitude  of  the 
magnetic field generated from three different geometries of current carrying wire loops.

Experiment 3: Magnetic Fields Pre-Lab Questions 

 
Answer these questions on a separate sheet of paper and turn them in before the lab 
 
1.   Superposition 

 
Consider two bar magnets placed at right 
angles to each other, as pictured at left.   
 
(a)    If  a  small  compass  is  placed  at  point  P, 
what  direction  does  the  painted  end  of  the 
compass needle point? 
 
(b)    If  the  compass  needle  instead  pointed  15 
degrees  clockwise  of  where  you  predicted  in 
(a),  what  could  you  qualitatively  conclude 
about the relative strengths of the two magnets?

As  pictured  at  left,  a  Helmholtz  coil  is  created  by  placing  two 
such coils (each of radius R and N turns) a distance R apart. 
 
(a)    If  the  current  in  the  two  coils  is  parallel  (Helmholtz 
configuration),  what  is  the  axial  field  strength  at  the  center  of 
the apparatus  (midway between  the  two coils)?   How does  this 
compare  to  the  field  strength  at  the  center  of  the  single  coil 
configuration (e.g. what is the ratio)? 

 
(b)  In  the anti-Helmholtz configuration  the current  in  the  two coils  is anti-parallel.   What 
is field strength at the center of the apparatus in this situation? 
 
(c) Our coils have a radius R = 7 cm and N = 168 turns, and we will run with I = 0.6 A in  
single  coil  and  0.3 A  in Helmholtz  and  anti-Helmholtz mode.   What,  approximately,  are 
the  largest  on-axis  fields  we  should  expect  in  these  three  configurations?    Where 
(approximately)  are  the  fields  the  strongest?    Write  the  answer  to  this 
question in your notes.  You will need it for the lab.

IN-LAB ACTIVITIES 
 
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
 
1.  Download the LabView file and start up the program. 
2.  Connect the Magnetic Field Sensor to Analog Channel A on the 750 Interface 
3.  Without  leads  connected  to  the power  supply,  turn  it on  and  set  the voltage output  to 
2 V.  Turn it off. 
NOTE:  When  working  with  bar  magnets,  please  do  NOT  force  a  north  pole  to  touch  a 
north pole (or force south poles to touch), as this will demagnetize the magnets. 

 
MEASUREMENTS 
Part 1: Mapping Magnetic Field Lines Using Mini-Compasses 
1.  Tape a piece of brown paper (provided) onto your table. 
2.  Place a bar magnet about 3 inches from the far side of the paper, as shown below. 
Trace the outline of the magnet on the paper. 

(cid:55)  3 inches, more or less 

Table edge 

 
3.  Place a compass near one end of  the magnet.   Make  two dots on  the paper, one at 
the end of  the compass needle next  to  the magnet and  the  second at  the other end 
of  the compass needle.   Now move  the compass so  that  the end of  the needle  that 
was next  to  the magnet  is directly over  the second dot, and make a new dot at  the 
other  end  of  the  needle.    Continue  this  process  until  the  compass  comes  back  to 
the  magnet  or  leaves  the  edge  of  the  paper.    Draw  a  line  through  the  dots  and 
indicate  with  an  arrowhead  the  direction  in  which  the  North  end  of  the  needle 
pointed, as shown below

4.  Repeat the process described above several more times (~4 field lines), starting at 
different  locations  on  the  magnet.   Work  fairly  quickly  –  it  is  more  important  to 
get a feeling for the shape of the field lines than to map them precisely. 

 
Question 1: 
Mostly  your  field  lines  come  back  to  the  bar  magnet,  but  some  of  them  wander  off  and 
never  come  back  to  the  bar  magnet.    Which  part  of  your  bar  magnet  do  the  ones  that 
wander off never to return come from?  Where are they going? 
 
 
 
 
Part 2: Constructing a Magnetic Field Diagram 
2A: Parallel Magnets 
1.  Arrange two bar magnets and a series of compasses as pictured here: 

 
2.  Sketch  the  compass  needles’  directions  in  the  diagram.  Based  on  these  compass 
directions, sketch in some field lines.   

 
Question 2: 
Is there any place in this region where the magnetic field is zero?  If so, where?  How can 
you tell? 
 
 

 

E03-7

Question 3: 
Where  is  the magnetic  field  the  strongest  in  this  situation?   How  can  you  determine  this 
from the field lines? 
 
 
 
 
 
2B: Anti-Parallel Magnets 
1.  Arrange two bar magnets and a series of compasses as pictured here: 

 
2.  Sketch  the  compass  needles’  directions  in  the  diagram.  Based  on  these  compass 
directions, sketch in some field lines.   

 
Question 4: 
Is there any place in this region where the magnetic field is zero?  If so, where?  How can 
you tell?

Part 3: Helmholtz Coil 
In this part we are going to measure the z-component of the field along the z-axis (central 
axis of the coils) 
3A: Using a Single Coil 
1.  With  the power supply off, connect  the  red  lead  from  the power supply  to  the  red 
plug of  the  top coil, and  the black  lead  to  the black plug of  the  top coil.   Turn  the 
current  knob  fully  counter-clockwise  (i.e.  turn  off  the  current)  then  turn  on  the 
power supply and slowly turn the current up to ~ 0.6 A. 
2.  Put  the magnetic  field  sensor  in  axial mode,  set  its gain  to 10x  and place  it  along 
the central axis of the Helmholtz coil, pushing into the indentation at the center of 
the holder.  Tare it to set the reading to zero. 
3.  Start  recording  magnetic  field  (press  Go)  and  raise  the  magnetic  field  sensor 
smoothly along the z-axis until you are above the top coil.  Try raising at different 
rates  to  convince  yourself  that  this  only  changes  the  time  axis,  and  not  the 
measured magnitude of the field.

Question 5: 
Where  along  the  axis  is  the  field  from  the  single  coil  the  strongest?    What  is  its 
magnitude at this location?  How does this compare to your pre-lab prediction?

3B: Helmholtz Configuration 
1.  Move  the  black  lead  to  the  black  terminal  of  the  lower  coil,  and  connect  a  lead 
from  the  black  terminal  of  the  upper  to  the  red  terminal  of  the  lower,  sending 
current in the same direction through both coils.  Set the current to ~ 0.3 A 
2.  Follow  the  procedure  in  3A  to  again  measure  field  strength  along  the  z-axis, 
plotting on the below figure.

Question 6: 
Where  along  the  axis  is  the  field  from  the  strongest?    What  is  its  magnitude  at  this 
location?  How does this compare to your pre-lab prediction.  Aside from the location and 
strength of  the maximum,  is  there a qualitative difference between  the single coil and  the 
Helmholtz coil field profile?  If so, what is the difference? 
 
 
 
 
 
3C: Anti-Helmholtz Configuration 
1.  Swap  the  leads  to  the  lower  coil,  keeping  the  current  at  ~  0.3  A,  although  now 
running in opposite directions in the top and bottom coil. 
2.  Follow the procedure in 3A to again measure field strength along the z-axis.

Question 7: 
What are  two main differences between  the  field profile  in Anti-Helmholtz configuration 
and in Helmholtz configuration?  Does the maximum field strength match your prediction 
from the pre-lab? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Further Questions (for experiment, thought, future exam questions…) 
 
•  What does the field profile look like if we place two bar magnets next to each other 
rather than collinear with each other (either parallel or anti-parallel to each other). 
•  What does the radial field profile (e.g. the x component of the field) look like along 
the z-axis of the Helmholtz coil? 
•  What do the radial and axial field profiles look like moving across the top of the 
Helmholtz coil rather than down its central axis? 
It looks as though there is a local maximum of magnetic field strength at some point 
on the axis for both the single coil and Helmholtz coil configurations (at least looking 
at them along the z-axis only).  If we consider them three dimensionally are they still 
local maxima?  That is, if we move off axis does the magnitude of the field also 
decrease as we move away from these maxima points?
