PRE-LAB READING 

 

INTRODUCTION 
 
Thus far  in class we have  talked about fields, both gravitational and electric, and how we 
can use them to understand how objects can interact at a distance.  A charge, for example, 
creates an electric  field around  it, which can  then exert a  force on a second charge which 
enters  that  field.    In  this  lab we will  study  another way  of  thinking  about  this  interaction 
through electric potentials. 
 
The Details:  Electric Potential (Voltage) 
 
Before  discussing  electric  potential,  it  is  useful  to  recall  the  more  intuitive  concept  of 
potential  energy,  in  particular  gravitational  potential  energy.    This  energy  is  associated 
with a mass’s position in a gravitational field (its height).  The potential energy difference 
between being at  two points  is defined as  the amount of work  that must be done  to move 
between  them.    This  then  sets  the  relationship  between  potential  energy  and  force  (and 
hence field): 
 
 
 
We  earlier  defined  fields  by  breaking  a  two  particle  interaction,  force,  into  two  single 
particle  interactions,  the  creation  of  a  field  and  the  “feeling”  of  that  field.    In  the  same 
way,  we  can  define  a  potential  which  is  created  by  a  particle  (gravitational  potential  is 
created  by  mass,  electric  potential  by  charge)  and  which  then  gives  to  other  particles  a 
potential energy.  So, we define electric potential, V, and given the potential can calculate 
the field: 
 
 
 
Noting  the  similarity  between  (1)  and  (2)  and  recalling  that F = qE,  the potential  energy 
of a charge in this electric potential must be simply given by U = qV.

When  thinking about potential  it  is convenient  to  think of  it as “height” (for gravitational 
potential  in  a  uniform  field,  this  is  nearly  precise,  since  U  =  mgh  and  thus  the 
gravitational  potential  V  =  gh).    Electric  potential  is  measured  in  Volts,  and  the  word 
“voltage”  is often used  interchangeably with “potential.”   You are probably familiar with 
this  terminology  from batteries, which maintain  fixed potential differences between  their 
two ends (e.g. 9 V in 9 volt batteries, 1.5 V in AAA-D batteries). 
 
Equipotentials and Electric Fields 
 
When  trying  to  picture  a  potential  landscape,  a  map  of  equipotential  curves  –  curves 
along  which  the  potential  is  equal  –  can  be  very  helpful.    For  gravitational  potentials 
these maps are called topographic maps.  An example is shown in Fig. 1b. 
 
 
(a) 

(b) 

 
 
 
Figure  1:    Equipotentials.    A  potential  landscape  (pictured  in  3D  in  (a))  can  be 
represented  by  a  series  of  equipotential  lines  (b),  creating  a  topographic  map  of  the 
landscape.  The potential (“height”) is constant along each of the curves. 
 
Now  consider  the  relationship  between  equipotentials  and  fields.    At  any  point  in  the 
potential  landscape,  the  field  points  in  the  direction  that  a  mass  would  feel  a  force  if 
placed  there  (or  that  a  positive  charge  would  feel  a  force  for  electric  potentials  and 
fields).  So, place a ball at the top of the hill (near the center of the left set of circles in the 
topographic map  of  Fig.  1b).   Which way  does  it  roll?   Downhill!   But what  direction  is 
that?    Perpendicular  to  the  equipotential  lines.    Why?    Equipotential  lines  are  lines  of 
constant  height,  so  moving  along  them  at  all  does  not  achieve  the  objective  of  going 
downhill.    So  the  force  (and  hence  field)  must  point  across  them,  pushing  the  object 
downhill.  But why exactly perpendicular?  Work done on an object changes its potential, 
so  it  can  take  no  work  to  move  along  an  equipotential  line.    Work  is  given  by  the  dot 
product of force and displacement.  For this to be zero, the force must be perpendicular to 
the displacement, that is, force (and hence fields) must be perpendicular to equipotentials. 
 
Note:  Potential vs. Potential Difference 
 
Note that in equation (2) we only defined ∆V, the potential difference between two points, 
and not  the potential V.   This  is because potential  is  like height –  the  location we  choose 
to call “zero”  is completely arbitrary.   In  this  lab we will choose one  location  to call zero 
(the “ground”), and measure potentials relative to the potential at that location.

APPARATUS 
 
1.  Conducting Paper Landscapes 
 
To get a better feeling for what equipotential curves look like and how they are related to 
electric  field  lines,  we  will  measure  sets  of  equipotential  curves  for  several  different 
potential  landscapes.    These  landscapes  are  created  on  special  paper  (on  which  you  can 
measure  electric  potentials)  by  fixing  a  potential  difference  between  two  conducting 
shapes  on  the  paper.    For  reasons  that we will  discuss  later,  these  conducting  shapes  are 
themselves  equipotential  surfaces,  and  their  shape  and  relative  position  determines  the 
electric  field  and  potential  everywhere  in  the  landscape.    One  purpose  of  this  lab  is  to 
develop  an  intuition  for  how  this works.   There  are  four  landscapes  to  choose  from  (Fig. 
2), and you will measure equipotentials on two of them (one from Fig. 1a, b and one from 
Fig. 1c, d).

Figure  2 Conducting Paper Landscapes.   Each of  the  four  landscapes –  the “standard” 
(a)  dipole  and  (b)  parallel  plates,  and  the  “non-standard”  (c)  bent  plate  and  (d)  filled 
plates  –  consists  of  two  conductors  which  will  be  connected  to  the  positive  (red)  and 
ground (blue)  terminals of a battery.   In (d)  there  is an additional conductor which  is free 
to float  to whatever potential  is required.  The pads are painted on conducting paper with 
a 1 cm grid. 
 
2.  Science Workshop 750 Interface 
 
In  this  lab  we  will  use  the  Science  Workshop  750  interface  (Fig.  3)  both  to  create  the 
potential  landscapes  (using  the  “OUPUT”  connections  that  act  like  a  battery)  and  to 
measure  the  potential  at  various  locations  in  that  landscape  using  a  voltage  sensor  (see 
below).  There are two connections to the output, just like there are two sides of a battery.  

 

E01-3

The  one  marked  with  a  sin  wave  is  the  positive  terminal  and  the  one  marked  with  a 
triangle  (the  “ground  symbol”)  is  the negative  terminal.   The potential of  this  terminal  is 
what we will call zero.  We will set the potential difference between the two to 5 V.

3. Voltage Sensor 
 
In  order  to measure  the  potential  as  a  function  of  position  we  use  a  voltage  sensor  (Fig. 
4).     One side of  the sensor plugs  into Channel A on  the 750,  the other has  two  leads, red 
and  black.    When  the  750  records  the  “potential,”  it  really  measures  the  potential 
difference between the two leads, the potential at the red lead minus that at the black lead.

GENERALIZED PROCEDURE 
 
For  each  of  the  two  landscapes  that  you  choose,  you will  find  at  least  four  equipotential 
contours  by  searching  for  points  in  the  landscape  at  the  same  potential  using  the  voltage 
sensor.    After  recording  these  curves,  you  will  draw  several  electric  field  lines,  making 
use of the fact that they are everywhere perpendicular to equipotential contours.

Expt. 1: Equipotential Lines and Electric Fields Pre-Lab Questions 

 
Answer these questions on a separate sheet of paper and turn them in before the lab 
 
1.   Equipotentials Curves – Reading Topographic Maps 
 
Below is a topographic map of a 0.4 mi square region of San Francisco.  The contours 
shown are separated by heights of 25 feet (so from 375 feet to 175 feet above sea level 
for the region shown) 
 

From left to right, the NS streets shown 
are Buchanan, Laguna, Octavia, Gough 
and Franklin.  From top to bottom, the 
EW streets shown are Broadway, 
Pacific, Jackson, Washington, Clay 
(which stops on either side of the park) 
and Sacramento. 
 
(a)  In the part of town shown in the 
above map, which street(s) have the 
steepest runs?  Which have the most 
level sections?  How do you know? 
 
(b)  How steep is the steepest street at 
its steepest (what is its slope in ft/mi)? 

 
(c) Which would take more work (in the physics sense):  walking 3 blocks south from 
Laguna and Jackson or 1 block west from Clay and Franklin? 
 
2.   Equipotentials, Electric Fields and Charge 
 
One group did this lab and measured the 
equipotentials for a slightly different 
potential landscape then the ones you 
have been given (although still on a 1 cm 
grid) and using +10 V rather than +5V. 
 
Note that they went a little overboard and 
marked equipotential curves (the magenta 
circles) at V = 0.25 V, 0.5V and then 
from V = 1 V to V = 10 V in 1 V 
increments. 
 
They followed the convention that red 
was their positive electrode (V = +10 V) 
and blue was ground (V = 0 V).

(a)  Copy the above figure and sketch eight electric field lines on it (equally spaced 
around the inner conductor). 
 
(b) What, approximately, is the magnitude of the electric field at r = 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 
cm, where r is measured from the center of the inner conductor?  You should express the 
field in V/cm.  (HINT:  The field is the local slope (derivative) of the potential.  Also, if 
you choose to use a ruler realize that the above reproduction of this group’s results is not 
the same size as the original, where the grid size was 1 cm). 
 
(c)  What is the relationship between the density of the equipotential lines, the density of 
the electric field lines, and the strength of the electric field? 
 
(d)  Plot the field strength vs. 1/r2 for the three points from part (b).  If the field were 
created by a single point charge what shape should this sketch be?  Is it? 
 
(e)  Approximately how much charge was on the inner conductor when the group made 
their measurements?  Make sure you include the sign as well as the amplitude.  (HINT:  
Use the sketch of (d))

IN-LAB ACTIVITIES 
 
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
 
1.  Download  the  LabView  file  from  the  web  and  save  the  file  to  your  desktop  (right 
click on the link and choose “Save Target As”).  Start LabView by double clicking 
2.  Connect  cables  to  the  output  of  the  750  (red  to  the  sin wave marked  output,  black  to 
ground).  One member of the group will hold these wires to the two conductors while 
another maps out the equipotentials. 
3.  Connect the Voltage Sensor to Analog Channel A on the 750 Interface 
4.  Connect  the  black  lead  of  the  voltage  sensor  to  the  black  output  (the  ground).    You 
will use the red lead to measure the potential around your landscapes. 

 
 
MEASUREMENTS 
 
Part 1: “Standard” Configuration 
1.  Choose  one  of  the  two  “standard”  conducting  paper  landscapes  (the  dipole  or 
parallel plate configuration) 
2.  Use the voltage connectors to make contacts to the two conducting pads 
3.  Press  the  green  “Go”  button  above  the  graph  to  energize  the  battery  and  begin 
recording the potential of the red lead (relative to the black lead = ground). 
4.  Measure  the  potential  of  both  conducting  pads  to  confirm  that  they  are  properly 
connected  (one  should  be  at  +5  V,  the  other  at  0  V),  and  that  they  are  indeed 
equipotential objects (we will explain why next week). 
5.  Now,  try  to  find  some  location  on  the  paper  that  is  at  about  +1  V  (don’t  worry 
about being too precise).  Mark this point on the plot on the next page.  
 
Do NOT write on the conducting paper 
 
 
6.  Find  another  1  V  point,  about  1  cm  away.    Continue  until  you  have  closed  the 
curve or left the page.  Sketch and label this equipotential curve. 
7.  Repeat  this process  to  find equipotentials at 2 V, 3 V, and 4 V.   Work pretty  fast; 
it’s  more  important  to  think  about  what  these  lines  mean  than  it  is  to  draw  them 
perfectly.    Think  about  what  you  are  doing  –  are  there  symmetries  that  you  can 
exploit to make this task easier? 

 

E01-7

“Standard” Configurations 

 

 

E01-8

Question 1: 
Sketch in a set of electric field lines (~ ten) on your plot of equipotentials on the previous 
page.    Where  do  the  field  lines  begin  and  end?    If  they  are  equally  spaced  at  their 
beginning, are they equally spaced at the end?  Along the way?  Why? 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 2: 
What, approximately, is the potential midway between the two conductors? 
 
 
 
Question 3: 
What,  approximately,  is  the  strength  of  the  electric  field  midway  between  the  two 
conductors?    You  may  find  it  easier  to  answer  this  question  if  you  just  measure  the 
potential at a few points near the center. 
 
 
 
Part 2: “Non-Standard” Configuration 
1.  Choose  one  of  the  two  “non-standard”  conducting  paper  landscapes  (the  bent 
plate  or filled plates configuration) 
2.  Use  the  voltage  connectors  to make  contacts  to  the  two  conducting  pads  (for  the 
filled plates, the center pad does not have a connection to it) 
3.  Press  the  green  “Go”  button  above  the  graph  to  energize  the  battery  and  begin 
recording the potential of the red lead (relative to the black lead = ground). 
4.  Confirm  that  everything  is  properly  connected  by  measuring  the  potential  on  the 
two  connected  pads,  then  record  a  set  of  equipotential  curves  following  the  same 
procedure of part 1.

Question 4: 
Sketch  in  a  set of  electric  field  lines on your plot of  equipotentials on  the previous page.  
Where is the electric field the strongest?  What, approximately, is its magnitude? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 5: 
Where is the electric field the most uniform?  How can you tell? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Further Questions (for experimentation, thought, future exam questions…) 
 
•  What changes if you switch which conducting pad is at +5 V and which is ground? 
•  What if you forget to connect the ground lead? 
• 
If you rest your hand on the paper while making measurements, does it affect the 
readings?  Why or why not? 
If you wanted to push a charge along one of the field lines from one conductor to the 
other, how does the choice of field line affect the amount of work required? 
•  The potential is everywhere the same on an equipotential line.  Is the electric field 
everywhere the same on an electric field line?
