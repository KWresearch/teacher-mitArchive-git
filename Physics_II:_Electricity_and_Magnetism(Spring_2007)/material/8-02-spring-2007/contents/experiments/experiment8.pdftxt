Answer these questions on a separate sheet of paper and turn them in before the lab 
 
1.  RLC Circuits 

Consider the circuit at left, consisting of an AC function 
V t
V
tω
, with V0 = 5 V), an inductor 
( )
s i n (
)
generator (
=
0
L = 8.5 mH, resistor R = 5 Ω, capacitor C = 47 µF and 
switch S. 
 
The  circuit  has  been  running  in  equilibrium  for  a  long 
time.    We  are  now  going  to  shut  off  the  function 
generator (instantaneously replace it with a wire). 
 
Assuming that our driving frequency ω is  not necessarily on resonance, what is 
the frequency with which the system will ring down (in other words, that current 
will oscillate at after turning off the function generator)?  Feel free to use an 
approximation if you wish, just make sure you know you are. 
At what (numerical) frequency f should we drive to maximize the peak magnetic 
energy in the inductor? 
In this case, if we time the shut off to occur when the magnetic energy in the 
inductor peaks, after how long will the electric energy in the capacitor peak? 
Approximately how much energy will the resistor have dissipated during that 
time?

MEASUREMENTS 
 
Part 1: Free Oscillations in an Undriven RLC Circuit 
In  this  part we  turn  on  a  battery  long  enough  to  charge  the  capacitor  and  then  turn  it 
off and watch the current oscillate and decay away. 
1.  Press the green “Go” button above the graph to perform this process. 
Question 1: 
What  is  the  period  of  the  oscillations  (measure  the  time  between  distant  zeroes  of  the 
current  and  divide  by  the  number  of  periods  between  those  zeroes)?    What  is  the 
frequency? 
 
 
Question 2: 
Is  this  frequency  the  same  as,  larger  than  or  smaller  than  what  you  calculated  it  should 
be?  If it is not the same, why not?

Part 3: Driving the RLC Circuit on Resonance 
Now we will use the function generator to drive the circuit with a sinusoidal voltage. 
1.  Enter  the  frequency  that  you  measured  in  part  1  of  the  lab  as  a  starting  point  to 
find the resonant frequency. 
2.  Press GO to start recording the function generator current and voltage vs. time, as 
well as a “phase plot” of voltage vs. current. 
3.  Adjust  the  frequency  up  and  down  to  find  the  resonant  frequency  and  observe 
what happens when driving above and below resonance. 

 
Question 4: 
What is the resonant frequency?  What are two ways in which you know? 
 
 
 
Question 5: 
What is the impedance of the circuit when driven on resonance (hint: use the phase plot)? 
 
 
Question 6: 
When  driving  on  resonance,  insert  the  core  into  the  inductor.    Are  you  now  driving  at, 
above or below the new resonant frequency of the circuit?  How can you tell?  Why? 
 
 
 
Part 4: What’s The Frequency? 
For  the  remainder of  the  lab you will make  some measurements where you are given 
incomplete  information  (for example, you won’t be shown  the  frequency or won’t be 
told  what  is  being  plotted).    From  the  results  you  must  determine  the  missing 
information.    If  you  find  this  difficult,  play  with  the  circuit  using  the  “further 
questions” tab to get a better feeling for how the circuit behaves. 
1.  Remove the core from the inductor 
2.  Press GO to record the function generator current and voltage  
Question 7: 
At  this  frequency  is  the  circuit  capacitor-  or  inductor-like?    Are  we  above  or  below  
resonance? 

 

E07-10

Part 5: What’s That Trace? 
1.  Press  GO  to  record  the  function  generator  current  and  voltage  as  well  as  the 
voltage  across  the  capacitor.    Note  that  you  are  not  told  which  trace  corresponds 
to which value.  

 
Question 8: 
What value is recorded in each of the three traces (I, VFG or VC)?  How do you know? 
 
 
 
 
Question 9: 
Are we above, below or on resonance?  How do you know? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Further Questions (for experiment, thought, future exam questions…) 
 
•  What happens if we insert the coil core in the undriven circuit? 
•  For a random frequency can you bring the circuit into resonance by slowly inserting 
the core into the coil?  Are there any conditions on the frequency (e.g. does it need to 
be above or below the resonant frequency of the circuit with the empty coil)? 
•  Could you do part 5 if you were given only two traces instead of three?  Would it 
matter which two you were given? 
•  What is the energy doing in the driven case?  Is the resistor still dissipating power?  If 
so, where is this power coming from? 
•  What happens to the resonant frequency of the circuit if a resistor is placed in series 
with the capacitor and coil?  In parallel?  NOTE:  You can use the variable resistor, 
called a potentiometer or “pot” (just to the left of the coil, connect to the center and 
right most contacts, allowing you to adjust the extra resistance from 0 Ω to 3.3Ω by 
simply turning the knob). 
•  With the resistor in series with the coil and capacitor, at what frequency is the energy 
dissipation a maximum?  How could you verify this experimentally?

OBJECTIVES  
 
1.  To  observe  the  polarization  and  angular  dependence  of  radiation  from  a 
microwave generator  
2.  To  measure  the  wavelength  of  the  microwave  radiation  by  analyzing  an 
interference pattern similar to a standing wave 

 

PRE-LAB READING 

 

INTRODUCTION 
 
Heinrich  Hertz  first  generated  electromagnetic  waves  in  1888,  and  we  replicate  Hertz’s 
original  experiment  here.    The  method  he  used  was  to  charge  and  discharge  a  capacitor 
connected to a spark gap and a quarter-wave antenna.  When the spark “jumps” across the 
gap  the  antenna  is  excited by  this discharge  current,  and  charges oscillate back  and  forth 
in the antenna at the antenna’s natural resonance frequency.  For a brief period around the 
breakdown  (“spark”),  the  antenna  radiates  electromagnetic waves  at  this  high  frequency.  
We  will  detect  and  measure  the  wavelength  λ  of  these  bursts  of  radiation.    Using  the 
f
cλ = = ×
3 10 cm/s
10
relation 
,  we  will  then  deduce  the  natural  resonance  frequency  of 
the  antenna,  and  show  that  this  frequency  is  what  we  expect  on  the  basis  of  the  very 
simple considerations given below.   
 

  
Figure 1 Spark-gap transmitter.  The 
“33”  is  a  33  pF  capacitor.    It  is 
responsible  for  storing  energy  to  be 
rapidly  discharged  across  a  “spark 
gap,” formed by two tungsten cylinders 
pictured  directly  above  it  (one  with  a 
vertical axis, one horizontal). Two MΩ 
limit  current  off  of 
resistors 
the 
capacitor  and  back  out 
the 
leads, 
protecting  the  user  from  shocks  from 
the  800  V  to  which  the  capacitor  will 
be  charged.    They  also  limit  radiation 
at incorrect frequencies.   

E08-1

 

 

The  33-pF  capacitor  shown  in  fig.  1  is  charged  by  a  high-voltage  power  supply  on  the 
circuit board provided.  This HVPS voltage is typically 800 V, but this is safe because the 
current  from  the  supply  is  limited  to a very  small value.   When  the electric  field  that  this 
voltage  generates  in  the  “spark  gap”  between  the  tungsten  rods  is  high  enough  (when  it 
exceeds  the breakdown  field of  air of  about 1000 V/mm)  the  capacitor discharges  across 
the  gap  (fig.  2a).   The  voltage  on  the  capacitor  then  rebuilds,  until  high  enough  to  cause 
another  spark,  resulting  in  a  continuous  series  of  charges  followed  by  rapid  bursts  of 
discharge (fig. 2b).

(b) 

 
 
Figure  2  Charging  and  Discharging  the  Capacitor.    The  capacitor  is  slowly  charged 
(limited  by  the  RC  time  constant,  with  R  =  4.5  MΩ)  and  then  (a)  rapidly  discharges 
across  the spark gap,  resulting  in  (b) a series of slow charge/rapid discharge bursts.   This 
is an example of a “relaxation oscillator.” 
 
The radiation we are seeking is generated in this discharge. 
 

Resonant Frequency of the Antenna 
 
The frequency of the radiation is determined by the time it takes charge to flow along the 
antenna.  Just  before  breakdown,  the  two  halves  of  the  antenna  are  charged  positive  and 
( ,
)+ −
negative 
 forming an electric dipole. There  is an electric  field  in  the vicinity of  this 
dipole.    During  the  short  time  during  which  the  capacitor  discharges,  the  electric  field 
decays and large currents flow, producing magnetic fields.  The currents flow through the 
spark  gap  and  charge  the  antenna  with  the  opposite  polarity.    This  process  continues  on 
and on for many cycles at the resonance frequency of the antenna.  The oscillations damp 
out  as  energy  is  dissipated  and  some  of  the  energy  is  radiated  away  until  the  antenna  is 
finally discharged.  
 

How  fast do  these oscillations  take place –  that  is, what  is  the resulting frequency 
of  the  radiated  energy?    An  estimate  can  be  made  by  thinking  about  the  charge  flow  in 
the antenna once a spark in the gap allows charge to flow from one side to the other.  If 
 
l
l =
31 mm
is  the  length  of  one  of  the  halves  of  the  antenna  (about 
 in  our  case),  then  the 
distance  that  the  charge  oscillation  travels  going  from  the  ( ,
)+ −  polarity  to  the  ( ,
)− +  
polarity  and  back  again  to  the  original  ( ,
)+ −  polarity  is 
 (from  one  tip  of  the  antenna 
4l
to  the  other  tip  and  back  again).    The  time  T  it  takes  for  this  to  happen,  assuming  that 
information  flows  at  the  speed  of  light  c,  is  T
c ,  leading  to  electromagnetic 
l= 4
radiation at a frequency of 1 T . 
Detecting (Receiving) the Radiation 

 

E08-2

 
In addition to generating EM radiation we will want to detect it.  For this purpose we will 
use  a  receiving  antenna  through  which  charge  will  be  driven  by  the  incoming  EM 
radiation.  This current is rectified and amplified, and you will read its average value on a 
multimeter  (although  the  fields  come  in  bursts,  the  multimeter  will  show  a  roughly 
constant amplitude because the time between bursts is very short, as you will calculate in 
pre-lab #1).

reating Standing Waves (sort of) Using a Reflector 

If a conducting sheet (blue in the figure at left) is placed in the path of 
an  electromagnetic  wave,  surface  currents  will  be  generated  in  the 
conductor  that  reradiate  the  wave  backwards,  as  a  reflected  wave.  
The  phase  of  the  reflected  wave  is  set  so  as  to  guarantee  that  the 
electric  field  at  the  surface  of  the  conductor  is  always  zero.    The 
reflected  and  incoming  waves  interfere,  summing  to  create  a  new 
standing wave, which has nodes  every half wavelength.    In  the  figure 
at left at the time pictured the waves cancel everywhere.  A small time 
later  this will  no  longer  be  the  case,  and  the  cancellation will  only  be 
perfect at those nodes (as you will calculate in pre-lab #3). 

 
hus  in  order  to  measure  the  wavelength  of  radiation  we  can  simply  move  the  receiver 
T
between  the  reflector  and  the  antenna  and  look  for  nodes.    Using  the  distance  between 
nodes we can then calculate the wavelength. 
 
T
his ideal picture doesn’t perfectly hold in our case.  The antenna creates dipole radiation 
rather  than  plane  waves,  so  the  amplitude  of  the  radiation  is  not  spatially  constant,  but 
instead falls with distance from  the  transmitter.   Thus we do not create a perfect standing 
wave.    However,  minima  in  the  radiation  intensity  will  still  be  created  where  standing 
wave nodes occur in the ideal case, and you will still be able to measure the wavelength.

These  have  been  described  in  detail  above. 
 
The  spark  gap  of  the  transmitter  (pictured  left) 
can  be  adjusted  by  turning  the  plastic wing  nut 
(top).    It  is  permanently  wired  in  to  the  high 
voltage power supply on the circuit board.  The 
receiver  (pictured  right)  must  be  plugged  in  to 
the circuit board.

2.  Circuit Board 

This  board  contains  a  high 
voltage 
power 
supply 
for 
charging  the  transmitter,  as  well 
as  an  amplifier  for  boosting  the 
signal  from  the  receiver.    It  is 
powered  by 
a 
small  DC 
transformer 
that  must 
be 
plugged  in  (AC  in).    When 
power  is on,  the green LED  (top 
center) will glow. 
 

 
 
 

 
3.  Science Workshop 750 Interface and Voltage Probe 
 
We  read  the  signal  strength  from  the  receiver  –  proportional  to  the  radiation  intensity  at 
the  receiver  –  by  connecting  the  output  (lower  right  of  circuit  board)  to  a  voltage  probe 
plugged in to channel A of the 750. 
 
 
GENERALIZED PROCEDURE 
 
In  this  lab  you  will  turn  on  the  transmitter,  and  then,  using  the  receiver,  measure  the 
intensity  of  the  radiation  at  various  locations  and  orientations.    It  consists  of  three  main 
parts. 
 
Part 1: Polarization of the Emitted Radiation 
In this part you will measure to see if the produced radiation is polarized, and if so, along 
what axis. 
 
Part 2: Angular Dependence of the Emitted Radiation 
Next,  you  will  measure  the  angular  dependence  of  the  radiation,  determining  if  your 
position relative to the transmitter matters. 
 
Part 3: Wavelength of the Emitted Radiation 
Finally,  you will measure  the wavelength  (and  hence  frequency)  of  the  emitted  radiation 
by  placing  a  reflector  near  the  transmitter  and  creating  a  standing-wave  like  pattern.   By 
measuring  the  distances  between  minima,  you  can  determine  the  wavelength  (as 
calculated in pre-lab #3).

Answer these questions on a separate sheet of paper and turn them in before the lab 
 
1.  Spark Gap Distance and Timing 
The  time  to  charge  the  transmitter  capacitor  until  it  discharges  depends  on  the  resistance 
in  the  charging  circuit  (R  =  4.5  MΩ),  the  capacitance  (C  =  33  pF)  and  the  voltage 
required  to  initiate  breakdown.    Assume  that  the  power  supply  supplies  800  V  but  that 
breakdown typically occurs at a voltage of about 500 V on the capacitor. 
 
(a) 

Thinking of the tungsten electrodes as parallel plates, how far apart must they be 
in order generate a spark at 500 V? 
In reality, the electrodes aren’t parallel plates, but rather cylinders with a fairly 
small radius of curvature.  Given this, will the distance needed between the 
electrodes to generate sparking be smaller or larger than you calculated in (a)?  
Why? 
About how much time will it take for the power supply to charge the capacitor 
from empty to discharge? 

(b) 

(c) 

the wavelength of the emitted radiation? 
the frequency of the emitted radiation? 

 
2.  Wavelength and Frequency of the Radiation 
The  spark-gap  antenna  is  a  quarter-wavelength  antenna,  radiating  as  described  above.  
Using l = 31 mm for the length of one of the arms of the antenna, what is 
 
(a) 
(b) 
 
3.  Reflections 
Now place the transmitter some distance in front of a perfectly conducting sheet, oriented 
so  that  the propagation direction of  the waves hitting  the  reflector  is perpendicular  to  the 
plane  of  the  reflector  (so  that  they’ll  reflect  straight  back  out  towards  the  transmitter).  
For  example,  place  the  transmitter  at  z  =  -D  with  the  antenna  parallel  to  the  x-axis,  and 
have the reflector fill the z=0 (xy-) plane. 
(a)  Write  an  equation  for  the  electric  field  component  of  the  radiation  from  the 
transmitter  (the  incident  wave).    Treat  the  field  as  plane  wave,  with  a  constant 
amplitude E0 and angular frequency ω0. 
(b)  What  condition must  the  total  electric  field  satisfy  at  the  surface of  the  conductor 
(z=0)? 
(c)  What is the direction of propagation of the reflected wave? 
(d)  Write  an  equation  for  the  time  dependent  amplitude  &  direction  of  the  reflected 
wave, making the same assumptions as above. 
(e)  Write  an  equation  for  the  total  amplitude  of  the  electric  field  as  a  function  of 
position, by adding (c) and (d). 
Nodes  are  locations  (in  this  case  planes)  where  the  electric  field  is  zero  at  all 
times.  What is the distance between nodes along the z-axis? 
(g)  What is the numerical distance you thus expect for our transmitter (i.e. use 2a)?

1.  Download  the  LabView  file  from  the  web  and  save  the  file  to  your  desktop.    Start 
LabView by double clicking on this file. 
2.  Plug the power supply into the circuit board 
3.  Plug the receiver into the input jack on the circuit board 
4.  Turn on the transmitter – a LED will light indicating it is on 
5.  Adjust  the spark gap using  the wing nut on  the clothespin antenna.   Start with a  large 
gap,  and  close  the  gap  until  a  steady  spark  is  observed. You  should  observe  a  small, 
steady bright blue light and hear the hum of sparking. 
6.  Use the receiver to measure the intensity of the radiation as described below 
 
MEASUREMENTS 
 
Part 1: Polarization of the Emitted Radiation 
In  this  part we will measure  the  polarization  of 
the emitted radiation.

Question 1: 
Which orientation, if either, results in a larger signal in the receiver? 
 
Question 2: 
Is  the  electric  field  polarized?    That  is,  is  it  oscillating  along  a  certain  direction,  as 
opposed  to  being  unpolarized  in which  case  it  points  along  a wide  variety  of  directions?  
If it is polarized, along which axis? 
 
 
Question 3: 
Is the magnetic field polarized?  If so, along which axis?  How do you know? 
 

 

E08-7

Part 2: Angular Dependence of the Emitted Radiation 
1.  Now  measure  the  angular  dependence  of  the  radiation  intensity  by  moving  the 
receiver along the two paths indicated in the below figures. 

 

 

Angular dependence - Vertical 

Angular dependence - Horizontal 

 
 
Question 4: 
Which kind of motion, horizontal or vertical, shows a  larger change  in radiation  intensity 
over the range of motion? 
 
 
 
Part 3: Wavelength of the Emitted Radiation 
Now  we  will  use  the  reflector  to  create  an  interference  pattern  that  we  can  use  to 
measure the wavelength of the radiation.  We will do this in two ways. 
1.  Position  the  reflector  so  that  it  is  about  30-
40 cm
 from  the  spark  gap  transmitter 
(note that you can insert the tube into notch on the bottom of the reflector in order 
to  make  a  stable  base  for  it  to  stand  on).    You  may  need  to  change  this  distance 
slightly to get good results.  Experiment! 
2.  Orient  the  transmitter  so  that  the  propagation  direction  of  the  waves  hitting  the 
reflector  is  perpendicular  to  the  plane  of  the  reflector  (so  that  they’ll  reflect 
straight back out towards the transmitter). 
3.  Place  the  receiver  between  the  transmitter  and  the  reflector  and  then  on  the  other 
side of the reflector to see that the waves are reflected (not at all transmitted). 
4.  Place the receiver, in the best orientation, between the reflector and the transmitter 
very near the reflector. 

 

 

E08-8

Part 3A:  Imprecise Method 
1.  Slowly  move  the  receiver  towards  the  transmitter,  looking  for  a  minimum  in  the 
radiation intensity.  Be careful to keep the receiver at a constant height and in line 
between the transmitter and the reflector. 
2.  Measure the distance between the first and second minimum that you find.   
 
Question 5: 
What is the distance between intensity minima? 
 
 

Part 3B:  More Precise Method 
1.  Slowly  move  the  receiver  towards  the  transmitter,  looking  for  a  minimum  in  the 
radiation intensity. 
2.  Now,  hold  the  receiver  very  steady  and  have  another  group  member  slowly  pull 
the  reflector  away  from  the  receiver.    Because  the  reflector  sits  on  the  table  it  is 
easier to measure the distance it has traveled when the next minimum is found. 
3.  Repeat the measurement several times to get an accurate average distance reading. 

 
Question 6: 
What is the distance between intensity minima? 
 
 
Question 7: 
What is the wavelength of the radiation?  What frequency does this correspond to? 
 
 
 
Further Questions (for experiment, thought, future exam questions…) 
 
• 
Is there any radiation intensity of any polarization off the ends of the antenna? 
•  An antenna similar to this was used by Marconi for his first transatlantic broadcast.  
What issues would you face to receive such a broadcast? 
•  What happens if the reflector is tilted relative to the transmitter?  How tilted can it be 
for you to still get a reasonable result? 
If you had a second reflector on the other side of the transmitter, could you create a 
resonant cavity where the reflected waves from each reflector add constructively?  
Would it matter where the transmitter was in the cavity?
