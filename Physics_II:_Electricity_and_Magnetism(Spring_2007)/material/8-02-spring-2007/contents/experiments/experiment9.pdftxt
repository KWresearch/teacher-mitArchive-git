Experiment 9: Interference and Diffraction 

 
OBJECTIVES  
 
1.  To explore the diffraction of light through a variety of apertures 
2.  To learn how interference can be used to measure small distances very accurately.  
By  example  we  will  measure  the  wavelength  of  the  laser,  the  spacing  between 
tracks on a CD and the thickness of human hair 

 
WARNING!  The  beam  of  laser  pointers  is  so  concentrated  that  it  can  cause  real 
damage to your retina if you look into the beam either directly or by reflection from 
a shiny object.  Do NOT shine them at others or yourself. 
 

 

PRE-LAB READING 

INTRODUCTION 
 
Electromagnetic  radiation propagates as a wave, and as such can exhibit  interference and 
diffraction.  This is most strikingly seen with laser light, where light shining on a piece of 
paper  looks  speckled  (with  light  and  dark  spots)  rather  than  evenly  illuminated,  and 
where  light  shining  through  a  small  hole makes  a  pattern  of  bright  and  dark  spots  rather 
than  the single spot you might expect  from your everyday experiences with  light.    In  this 
lab  we  will  use  laser  light  to  investigate  the  phenomena  of  interference  and  diffraction 
and  will  see  how  we  can  use  these  phenomena  to  make  accurate  measurements  of  very 
small objects like the spacing between tracks on a CD and the thickness of human hair. 
 
The Details:  Interference 
Consider two traveling waves, moving through space:

Constructive 
Interference

The  picture  at  left  forms  the  basis  of  all  the 
phenomena  you  will  observe  in  the  lab.    Two 
different  waves  arrive  at  a  single  position  in 
space (at the screen).  If they are in phase then 
they  add  constructively  and  you  see  a  bright 
spot.    If  they  are  out  of  phase  then  they  add 
destructively and you see nothing (dark spot). 
 
The  key  to  creating  interference  is  creating 
phase  shift  between  two  waves  that  are  then 
brought  together  at  a  single  position.    A  common  way  to  do  that  is  to  add  extra  path 
length  to  one  of  the  waves  relative  to  the  other.    In  this  lab  the  distance  traveled  from 
source  to  screen,  and  hence  the  relative  phase  of  incoming waves,  changes  as  a  function 
of lateral position on the screen, creating a visual interference pattern.

Here  the extra path  length  is 

The  first  phenomenon  we  consider  is  two  slit 
interference.  Light from the laser hits two very 
narrow  slits, which  then  act  like  in-phase  point 
sources  of  light.    In  traveling  from  the  slits  to 
the screen, however, the light from the two slits 
travel  different  distances.    In  the  picture  at  left 
light hitting point P from the bottom slit travels 
further  than  the  light  from  the  top  slit.    This 
extra  path  length  introduces  a  phase  shift 
between  the  two  waves  and  leads  to  a  position 
dependent interference pattern on the screen.

Realizing that phase shifts that are multiples of 2π give us constructive interference while 
odd  multiples  of  π  lead  to  destructive  interference  leads  to  the  following  conditions:

Multiple Slit Interference 
If  instead  of  two  identical  slits  separated  by  a

separated by a distance d,  the  same effect happens.

now  from  all  of  the  holes.    The  difference  in  the 
resulting  interference  pattern  lies  in  those  regions 
that  are  neither maxima  or minima  but  rather  in  between.   Here,  because more  incoming 
waves  are  available  to  interfere,  the  interference  becomes  more  destructive,  making  the 
minima  appear  broader  and  the  maxima  sharper.    This  explains  the  appearance  of  a 
brilliant  array  of  colors  that  change  as  a  function of  angle when  looking  at  a CD.   A CD 
has  a  large  number  of  small  grooves,  each  reflecting  light  and  becoming  a  new  source 
like  a  small  slit.    For  a  given  angle,  a  distinct  set  of  wavelengths  will  form  constructive 
maxima when the reflected light reaches your eyes. 
 
Diffraction 

The  next  kind  of  interference we  consider  is  light  going  through  a 
single  slit,  interfering  with  itself.    This  is  called  diffraction,  and 
arises from the finite width of the slit (a in the picture at left).  The 
resultant  effect  is  not  nearly  as  easy  to  derive  as  that  from  two-slit 
interference  (which,  as  you  can  see  from  above,  is  straight-
forward).    The  result  for  the  anglular  locations  of  the  minima  is

Putting it Together 
If  you  have  two wide  slits,  that  is,  slits  that  exhibit  both  diffraction  and  interference,  the 
pattern observed on a distant screen is as follows:  

 
Here  the  amplitude  modulation  (the  red  envelope)  is  set  by  the  diffraction  (the  width  of 
the  slits),  while  the  “individual  wiggles”  are  due  to  the  interference  between  the  light 
coming from the two different slits.  You know that this must be the case because d must 
be  larger  than  a,  and  hence  the  minima  locations,  which  go  like  1/d,  are  closer  together 
for the two slit pattern than for the single slit pattern. 
 
The Opposite of a Slit:  Babinet’s Principle 
 
So  far  we  have  discussed  sending  light  through  very  narrow  slits  or  reflecting  it  off  of 
small grooves,  in each case creating a  series of point-like “new sources” of  light  that can 
then go on and interfere.  Rather amazingly, light hitting a small solid object, like a piece 
of hair, creates  the same  interference pattern as  if  the object were  replaced with a hole of 
the  same  dimensions.    This  idea  is  Babinet’s  Principle,  and  the  reason  behind  it  is 
summed  up  by  the  pictoral  equation  at  right.  
If you add an object to a hole of the same size, 
you  get  a  filled  hole.   EM waves  hitting  those 
objects  must  add  in  the  same  fashion,  that  is, 
the electric fields produced when  light hits  the 
hole,  when  added  to  the  electric  fields  produced  by  the  small  object,  must  add  to  the 
electric fields produced when light hits the filled hole.  Since no light can get through the 
filled hole, Ehole + Eobject = 0.   Thus we find  that  the electric fields coming out of  the hole 
are  equal  and  opposite  to  the  electric  fields  diffracting  off  of  the  small  object.   Since  the 
observed  interference  pattern  depends  on  intensity,  the  square  of  the  electric  field,  the 
hole  and  the  object will  generate  identical  diffraction  patterns.    By measuring  properties 
of  the  diffraction  pattern we  can  thus measure  the width  of  the  small  object.    In  this  lab 
the small object will be a piece of your hair.

APPARATUS 
 
1.  Optical bench 

The optical bench consists of a holder 
for  a  laser  pointer,  a  mount  for  slides 
(which contain  the slits you will shine 
light  through),  and  a  sliding  block  to 
which  you  will  attach  pieces  of  paper 
to  mark  your  observed  interference 
patterns.    Note  that  a  small  ring  can 
be  slid  over  the  button  of  the  laser 
pointer  in  order  to  keep  it  on  while 
you make your measurements. 

 
2.  Slit Slides 
You will be given  two  slides, each  containing  four  sets of  slits  labeled a  through d.   One 
slide  contains  single  slits  with  widths  from  20  µm  to  160  µm.    The  other  slide  contains 
double slits with widths of 40 µm or 80 µm, separated by distances of 250 µm or 500 µm. 
 
 

GENERALIZED PROCEDURE 
 
In  this  lab  you  will  shine  the  light  through  slits,  across  hairs  or  off  of  CDs  and  make 
measurements of the resulting interference pattern.   
 
Part 1: Laser Wavelength 
In  this  part  you  will  measure  the  wavelength  of  the  laser  using  the  two  narrow  double 
slits, and making the measurements that you determine are necessary in pre-lab #1. 
 
Part 2: Diffraction from a CD 
Finally,  you  will  measure  the  width  of  tracks  on  a  CD  by  reflecting  laser  light  off  of  it 
and measuring the resulting diffraction pattern. 
 
Part 3: Thickness of Human Hair 
Next  you will  discover  the  ability  to measure  the  size  of  small  objects  using  diffraction, 
by measuring the width of a human hair.

Experiment 9: Interference and Diffraction 

(b) 

 
Answer these questions on a separate sheet of paper and turn them in before the lab 
 
1.  Measuring the Wavelength of Laser Light 
In the first part of this experiment you will shine a red laser through a pair of narrow slits 
(a = 40 µm)  separated by  a known distance  (you will use both d = 250 µm  and 500 µm) 
and  allow  the  resulting  interference pattern  to  fall on  a  screen  a distance L  away  (L ~  40 
cm).  This set up is as pictured in Fig. 2 (in the “Two Slit Interference” section above). 
 
(a)  Will the center of the pattern (directly between the two holes) be an interference 
minimum or maximum? 
You should be able to easily mark and then measure the locations of the 
interference maxima.  For the sizes given above, will these maxima be roughly 
equally spaced, or will they spread out away from the central peak?  If you find 
that they are equally spaced, note that you can use this to your advantage by 
measuring the distance between distance maxima and dividing by the number of 
intermediate maxima to get an average spacing.  If they spread out, which spacing 
should you use in your measurement to get the most accurate results, one close to 
the center or one farther away? 
Approximately  how  many  interference  maxima  will  you  see  on  one  side  of  the 
pattern  before  their  intensity  is  significantly  reduced  by  diffraction  due  to  the 
finite width a of the slit? 
Derive an equation for calculating the wavelength λ of the laser light from your 
measurement of the distance ∆y between interference maxima.  Make sure that 
you keep a copy of this equation in your notes!  You will need it for the lab. 
In  order  to most  accurately measure  the  distance  between maxima ∆y,  it  helps  to 
have them as far apart as possible.  (Why?)  Assuming that the slit parameters and 
light wavelength are fixed, what can we do in order to make ∆y bigger?  What are 
some reasons that can we not do this ad infinitum? 

 
 
2.  Single Slit Interference 
Now  that  you  have measured  the wavelength  λ  of  the  light  you  are  using,  you will want 
to  measure  the  width  of  some  slits  from  their  diffraction  pattern.    When  measuring 
diffraction  patterns  (as  opposed  to  the  interference  patterns  of  problem  1)  it  is  typically 
easiest to measure between diffraction minima. 
 
(a) 

Derive an equation for calculating  the width a of a slit from your measurement of 
the  distance ∆y  between  diffraction minima.   Make  sure  that  you  keep  a  copy  of 
this  equation  in  your  notes!    You  will  need  it  for  the  lab.    Note  that  this  same 
equation will be used for measuring the thickness of your hair. 
(b)  What is the width of the central maximum (the distance on the screen between the 
m=-1  and  m=1  minima)?    How  does  this  compare  to  the  distance ∆y  between 
other adjacent minima?

In addition  to using hair as a  thin 
object  for  diffraction,  you  can 
also  measure  its  thickness  using 
an  interferometer.    In  fact,  you 
can  use  this  to  measure  even 
smaller  objects.    Its  use  on  a 
small  fiber  is  pictured  at  left.  
The  fiber  is  placed  between  two 
glass  slides,  lifting  one  at  an 
angle  relative  to  the  other.    The 
slides  are  illuminated  with  green 
light  from  above,  and  when  the 
set-up  is  viewed  from  above,  an 
interference  pattern,  pictured  in 
the “Eye View”, appears. 

What is the thickness d of the fiber? 
 
 
 
4.  CD 
In  the  last  part  of  this  lab  you  will  reflect  light  off  of  a  CD  and  measure  the  resulting 
interference pattern on a screen a distance L ~ 5 cm away.   
A  CD  has  a  number  of  tracks,  each  of  width  d  (this  is  what  you  are  going  to 
(a) 
measure).  Each track contains a number of bits, of length l ~ d/3.  Approximately 
how  many  bits  are  there  on  a  CD?    In  case  you  didn’t  know,  CDs  sample  two 
channels (left and right) at a rate of 44100 samples/second, with a resolution of 16 
bits/sample.    In  addition  to  the  actual  data  bits,  there  are  error  correction  and 
packing bits that roughly double the number of bits on the CD. 
(b)  What,  approximately,  must  the  track  width  be  in  order  to  accommodate  this 
number  of  bits  on  a  CD?    In  case  you  don’t  have  a  ruler,  a  CD  has  an  inner 
diameter of 40 mm and an outer diameter of 120 mm. 
Derive  an  equation  for  calculating  the  width  d  of  the  tracks  from  your 
measurement  of  the  distance ∆y  between  interference  maxima.    Make  sure  that 
you keep a copy of this equation in your notes!  You will need it for the lab. 
Using  the  previous  results,  what  approximately  will  the  distance  between 
interference maxima ∆y be on the screen?

MEASUREMENTS 
 
Part 1: Laser Wavelength 
In this part you will measure the wavelength λ of the laser light you are using 
1.  Set up the optical bench as pictured in the apparatus diagram.   
a.  Clip paper onto the wooden slide, and place roughly 40 cm away from the 
slide holder 
b.  Place  the  double  slit  slide  in  the  slide  holder  and  align  so  that  light  from 
the laser goes through slit pattern a. 
c.  Turn the laser on (lock it with the clip that slides around the on button) 
d.  Adjust  the  location of  the wooden slide so  that  the pattern  is visible but as 
large as possible 
2.  Mark  the  locations  of  the  intensity  maxima.    If  they  are  too  close  to  measure 
individually, mark of a set of them and determine the average spacing. 

 
Question 1:

Part 3: Thickness of Human Hair 
Now you will measure the thickness of a human hair using diffraction.   
1.  Remove  the  CD  and  card  from  the  wooden  slide,  and  tape  some  hair  across  the 
hole (the hair should run vertically as pictured below). 
2.  Clip a card to the block at the end of the apparatus. 
3.  Shine  the  laser  on  the  hair,  and  adjust  the  distance  between  the  hair  and  the  card 
so that you obtain a useable diffraction pattern.

  Does  this  seem 
reasonable? 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Further Questions (for experiment, thought, future exam questions…) 
 
• 

• 

Instead of measuring the wavelength of light from the two slit patterns, you could 
have instead used single slits.  Would that have been more or less accurate?  Why? 
•  Why did you use two slit patterns a to measure the light wavelength rather than 
pattern d. 
•  Where does most of the measurement error come from?  How would you improve 
this in future labs? 
If we redid these experiments with a blue laser instead of red, what changes would 
you have needed to make?  Would it have affected the accuracy of the measurements? 
•  Does the track width change as a function of location on the CD?  If so, is it larger or 
smaller near the outside? 
•  What is the ratio of the track size to the wavelength of the light that you used (which 
is very similar to the wavelength of light used in commercial players)? 
•  What would happen to the diffraction pattern if the track width was smaller? 
•  Why are people anxious to move to blue lasers in commercial CD and DVD players?
