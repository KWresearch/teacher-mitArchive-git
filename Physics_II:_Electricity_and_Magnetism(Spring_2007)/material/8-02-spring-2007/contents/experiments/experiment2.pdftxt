PRE-LAB READING 

INTRODUCTION 
 
When  a  charged object  is placed near  a  conductor,  electric  fields  exert  forces on  the  free 
charge carriers  in  the conductor which cause  them  to move.   This process occurs rapidly, 
and  ends when  there  is no  longer  an  electric  field  inside  the  conductor  (Einside conductor=0). 
The surface of the conductor ends up with regions where there is an excess of one type of 
charge over  the other.   For example,  if a positive charge  is placed near a metal, electrons 
will move  to  the  surface nearest  the charge,  leaving a net positive charge on  the opposite 
surface1.    This  charge  distribution  is  called  an  induced  charge  distribution.  The  process 
of separating positive from negative charges on a conductor by  the presence of a charged 
object is called electrostatic induction. 
 
Michael  Faraday  used  a  metal  ice  pail  as  a  conducting  object  to  study  how  charges 
distributed  themselves  when  a  charged  object  was  brought  inside  the  pail.  Suppose  we 
lower a positively charged metal ball  into  the pail without  touching  it  to  the pail.   When 
we  do  this,  positive  charges  move  as  far  away  from  the  ball  as  possible  –  to  the  outer 
surface of  the pail,  leaving a net negative charge on  the  inner  surface.    If at  this point we 
provide  some  way  for  the  positive  charges  to  flow  away  from  the  pail,  for  example  by 
touching  our  hand  to  it,  they will  run  off  through  our  hand.  If we  then  remove  our  hand 
from  the  pail  and  then  remove  the  positively  charged metal  ball  from  inside  the  pail,  the 
pail will be left with a net negative charge.  This is called charging by induction.   
 
In  contrast,  if  we  touch  the  positively  charged  ball  to  the  uncharged  pail,  electrons  flow 
from  the  pail  into  the  ball,  trying  to  neutralize  the  positive  charge  on  it.  This  leaves  the 
pail with a net positive charge. This is called charging by contact.   
 
Finally,  when  a  positively  charged  ball  approaches  the  ice  pail  from  outside  of  the  pail, 
charges  will  redistribute  themselves  on  the  outside  surface  of  the  pail  and  will  exactly 
cancel the electric field inside the pail.  This is called electrostatic shielding.  

                                                
 
1  We  will  typically  say  that  “positive  charge  flows  outward”  even  though  in  metals  it’s  really  electrons 
moving inward.  This is a completely equivalent way of thinking about it for our purposes.

You  will  investigate  all  three  of  these  phenomena—charging  by  induction,  charging  by 
contact, and electrostatic shielding—in this experiment.   
 
The Details:  Gauss’s Law 
 
In the above situations, the excess charge on the conductor resides entirely on the surface, 
a  fact  that  may  be  explained  by  Gauss’s  Law.  Gauss’s  Law2  states  that  the  electric  flux 
through any closed surface is proportional to the charge enclosed inside that surface,

Consider a mathematical, closed Gaussian surface that is inside the ice pail: 

 

 
Figure 1  Top View of Gaussian surface for the Faraday Ice Pail (a thick walled cylinder) 
 
Once  static  equilibrium  has  been  reached,  the  electric  field  inside  the  conducting  metal 
walls  of  the  ice  pail  is  zero.   Since  the Gaussian  surface  is  in  a  conducting  region where 
there  is  zero  electric  field,  the  electric  flux  through  the  Gaussian  surface  is  zero. 
Therefore, by Gauss’s Law,  the net charge  inside  the Gaussian  surface must be zero. For 
the Faraday ice pail, the positively charged ball is inside the Gaussian surface. Therefore, 
there  must  be  an  additional  induced  negative  charge  on  the  inner  surface  of  the  ice  pail 
that exactly cancels the positive charge on the ball.   It must reside on the surface because 
we could make the same argument with any Gaussian surface, including one which is just 
barely  outside  the  inner  surface.    Since  the  pail  is  uncharged,  by  charge  conservation 
there must be a positive  induced charge on  the pail which has  the  same magnitude as  the 
negative  induced  charge.  This  positive  charge  must  reside  outside  the  Gaussian  surface, 
hence on the outer surface of the ice pail. 
 
Note  that  the  electric  field  in  the  hollow  region  inside  the  ice  pail  is  not  zero  due  to  the 
presence  of  the  charged  ball,  and  that  the  electric  field  outside  the  pail  is  also  not  zero, 
due to the positive charge on its outer surface. 
                                                 
2   For more details on Gauss’s Law, see Chapter 4 of the Course Note, Section 4.3 for info on conductors.

Now suppose the ice pail is connected to a large conducting object (“ground”):  
 

 

 
Figure 2 Grounding the ice pail (left) and after removing the ground & ball (right) 
 
Now  the  positive  charges  that  had  moved  to  the  surface  of  the  ice  pail  can  get  even 
further away from the positively charged metal ball by flowing into the ground.  Now that 
there  are  no  charges  on  the  outer  surface  of  the  pail,  the  electric  field  outside  the  pail  is 
zero  and  the  pail  is  at  the  same  “zero”  potential  as  the  ground  (and  infinity).    If  the wire 
to ground is then disconnected, the pail will be left with an overall negative charge. Once 
the  positively  charged  ball  is  removed,  this  negative  charge  will  redistribute  itself  over 
the outer surface of the pail. 
 
Finally, when a charged ball approaches the ice pail from outside of the pail, charges will 
redistribute themselves on the outside surface of the pail while the electric field inside the 
pail  will  remain  zero,  cut-off  from  any  knowledge  of  what  is  going  on  outside  by  the 
enforced  zero  electric  field  inside  the  conductor.  This  effect  is  called  shielding  or 
“screening”  and  explains  popular  science  demonstrations  in  which  a  person  sits  safely 
inside a cage while an enormous voltage is applied to the cage. This same effect explains 
why  metal  boxes  are  used  to  screen  out  undesirable  electric  fields  from  sensitive 
equipment. 
 
APPARATUS 
 
1. Ice Pail 
 
Our  primary  apparatus  consists  of  two  concentric 
wire-mesh  cylinders.  The  inner  cylinder  (the  “pail”) 
is  electrically  isolated  by  three  insulating  rods.  The 
outer  cylinder  (the  “shield”)  will  be  attached  to 
ground  –  charge  can  flow  to  or  from  it  as  necessary.  
This  cylinder  will  act  both  as  a  screen  to  eliminate 
the  effect  of  any  external  charges  and  other  external 
fields  and  as  a  “zero  potential”  point,  relative  to 
which you will measure the potential of the pail.

2. Charge Producers 
 
To replace the positively charged metal ball of Faraday’s experiment, you will use charge 
producers  (Figure  4).    When  rubbed  together  a  net  positive  charge  will  move  to  one  of 
them and a net negative charge to the other.  
 

Charged pad

3. Charge Sensor 
 
The  Charge  Sensor  does  not  directly  measure  charge,  but  instead  measures  the  voltage  
difference between its positive (red) and negative (black) leads.  Furthermore, it connects 
the black lead to ground, meaning that as much charge can flow into or out of that lead as 
is necessary to keep it at “zero potential” (ideally the same voltage as at infinity).   
 

 

 
Figure  5  Charge  Sensor  –  measures  voltage  difference  between  its  red  and  black  leads.  
Left:  Shown attached to the lead assembly.  Right: The gain switch (used to amplify 
small signals) should be set at 1.  The zero button sets the output signal to zero. 
 
The  red  lead  is  free  to  be  at  any  potential,  although  by  pushing  the  “zero”  button  on  the 
sensor  (Fig.  5,  right),  it  too  can  be  attached  to  ground  (the  potential  difference  between 
the red and black leads is set to zero). 
 
Even though this is really a potential difference sensor, we none-the-less call it a “Charge 
Sensor” because the voltages measured arise from the presence of charges on the ice pail, 
as you will calculate in Pre-Lab problem 1.

4.  Science Workshop 750 Interface 
 
In  this  lab  we  will  for  the  first  time  use  the  Science  Workshop  750  interface  (Fig.  6).  
This  allows  signal  measurements  (in  this  lab,  from  the  charge  sensor)  to  be  sent  to  the 
computer where they can be recorded and plotted.

GENERALIZED PROCEDURE 
 
This  lab  consists  of  four  main  parts.    In  each  you  will  measure  the  voltage  between  the 
inner and outer cylinder to determine what is happening on the inner cylinder. 
 
Part 1: Determine Polarity of (Sign of Charge on) Charge Producers 
Here  you  will  lower  the  charge  producers  into  the  center  of  the  pail  (the  inner  cylinder) 
and determine which producer is positively charged and which is negatively charged 
 
Part 2: Charging by Contact 
You will  now  rub  the  charge  producer  against  the  inner  surface  of  the  pail  and  see  if  the 
charge is transferred to it. 
 
Part 3: Charging by Induction 
In  this  part  you  will  not  let  the  charge  producer  touch  the  pail,  but  will  instead  briefly 
ground  the  pail  by  connecting  it  to  the  shield  (the  outer  cylinder)  while  the  charge 
producer  is  inside.    Then  you  will  remove  the  charge  producer  and  observe  the  induced 
charge on the pail. 
 
Part 4:  Electrostatic Shielding 
In  this  part  you  will  measure  the  effects  of  placing  a  charge  producer  outside  of  the 
grounded shield.

Experiment 2: Faraday Ice Pail Pre-Lab Questions 

 
Answer these questions on a separate sheet of paper and turn them in before the lab 
 
1.   Capacitance of our Experimental Set-Up 
 
In this experiment we will measure the potential difference between the pail and the 
shield, and make statements about the charge on the pail based on this.  Here you will 
calculate the relationship between charge and potential. 
 
Consider two nested cylindrical conductors of height h and radii a & b respectively.  A 
charge +Q is evenly distributed on the outer surface of the pail (the inner cylinder), -Q on 
the inner surface of the shield (the outer cylinder). 
 

        

       
 
 
(a)  Calculate the electric field between the two cylinders (a < r < b). 
 
(b)  Calculate the potential difference between the two cylinders: 
∆V = V(a) – V(b) 

 

 
(c)  Calculate the capacitance of this system, C = Q/∆V 
 
(d)  Numerically evaluate the capacitance for your experimental setup, given: 
h  ≅ 15 cm, a ≅ 4.75 cm and b ≅ 7.25 cm 

 
The capacitance should be given in Farads (1 F = 1 Coulomb/Volt) or some fraction 
thereof (mF, µF, …)  Write this number in your notes, as you will use it to 
convert from the measured voltage difference ∆V to a charge on the outer surface of the 
pail (inner cylinder) Q, using Q = C ∆V 
 

 

E02-7

2.  What about charge on other surface? 
 
In  the  previous  problem we  assumed  that  charge was  located  on  the  outer  surface  of  the 
inner  cylinder  and  the  inner  surface  of  the  outer  one,  in  other  words,  if  both  cylinders 
were  charged.    What  if  instead  the  cylinders  were  both  neutral  but  exhibited  charge 
separation  due  to  the  presence  of  a  positive  charge  Q  sitting  in  the  interior  of  the  inner 
cylinder?  What now is the potential difference between the two cylinders? 
 
For the next three questions you are asked to sketch potential difference versus time 
as you move charges  into or around  the system.   You should mark the given actions 
on  the  time  axis  (assume  they  are  each  done  very  quickly  but  with  some  time  in 
between)  and  indicate what  happens  to  the  potential  difference when  each  action  is 
made.    In  each  case  the  potential  difference  should  start  at  zero  volts.    NOTE:    Of 
course  you  can’t  give  any  numbers,  we  just  want  you  to  indicate  if  the  potential 
increases or decreases or goes to zero or back to some previous value.

(a)

experiment.  Indicate the following events on the time axis:

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
1.  Download  the  LabView  file  from  the  web  and  save  the  file  to  your  desktop  (right 
click on  the  link  and  choose  “Save Target As”  to  the desktop.   Overwrite  any  file by 
this name that is already there).  Start LabView by double clicking on this file. 
2.  Using  the  multi-pin  cable,  connect  the  Charge  Sensor  to  Analog  Channel  A  on  the 
750 Interface.  The cable runs from the left end of the sensor (in Fig. 5) to Channel A. 
3.  Connect  the  lead  assembly  to  the  BNC  port  on  the  Charge  Sensor  (right  end  of  the 
sensor  in  Fig.  5).    Line  up  the  connector  on  the  end  of  the  cable  with  the  pin  on  the 
BNC port.   Push  the connector onto  the port and  twist  it clockwise about one-quarter 
turn until it clicks into place.   Set the Charge Sensor gain to 1x.   
4.  Connect  the  charge  sensor  input  lead  (red  alligator  clip)  to  the  pail  (the  inner  wire 
mesh cylinder), and  the ground  lead (black alligator clip)  to  the shield (the outer wire 
mesh cylinder).  

 
MEASUREMENTS 
Important Notes: 
The charge producers are delicate.  When rubbing them together do so briskly but gently. 
Each  experiment  should  begin  with  completely  discharged  cylinders.    To  discharge  
them,  ground  the  pail  by  touching  both  it  and  the  shield  at  the  same  time  with  a 
conductor (e.g. the finger of one hand).  You also will always want to zero the charge 
sensor before starting by pressing the “Zero” button.

1.  Ground the pail and zero the charge sensor 
2.  Start recording data. (Press the green “Go” button above the graph). 
3.  Rub the blue and white surfaces of the charge producers together several times.

outside  the  shield? Will  an  induced  charge  distribution  appear  on  the  pail?  Explain  your 
reasoning. Will an  induced charge distribution appear on  the  shield?   Are we  sensitive  to 
this?  What about the blue charge producer?  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Further Questions (for experiment, thought, future exam questions…) 
 
•  What happens if we repeat the above measurements with the ground (black clip) 
attached to the pail and the red clip attached to the shield?  Does anything change 
aside from the sign of the voltage difference? 
•  What happens if in part 2 we touch the charge producer to the outside of the pail 
rather than the inside? 
•  What happens if we place the charge producer between the pail & shield rather than 
inside the pail? 
•  What happens if we put both the white & blue charge producers inside the pail 
together (not touching, just both inside).  Is the cancellation exact?  Should it be? 
•  What if in part 2 we touch the white producer and then the blue producer to the pail?  
What if we touch the white producer, then recharge it and touch again?  Doing this 
repeatedly, is there a difference between touching the inside of the pail and the 
outside of the pail?
