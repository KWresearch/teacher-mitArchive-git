INTRODUCTION 
 
In this lab you will suspend a magnetic dipole (a small but strong bar magnet) in the field 
of a Helmholtz coil (the same apparatus you used in Expt. 4).  You will observe the force 
and torque on the dipole as a function of position, and hence external field. 
 
The Details:  Magnetic Dipoles in External Fields 
 
As we have discussed in class, magnetic dipoles are characterized by their dipole moment 
µ, a vector that points in the direction of the B field generated by the dipole (at the center 
of the dipole).  When placed in an external magnetic field B, they have a potential energy 
(cid:71)(cid:71)

That is, they are at their lowest energy (“happiest”) when aligned with a large external 
field 
 
Torque 
 
When  in  a  non-zero  external  field  the  dipole  will  want  to  rotate  to  align  with  it.    The 
magnitude of the torque which leads to this rotation is easily calculated:

Again,  the direction of  the  torque  is such  that  the dipole moment rotates  to align with  the 
field  (perpendicular  to  the  plane  in  which µ  and  B  lie,  and  obeying  the  right  hand  rule 
that if your thumb points in the direction of the torque, your fingers rotate from µ to B. 
 
Force 
 
In  order  to  feel  a  force,  the  potential  energy  of  the  dipole must  change with  a  change  in 
its  position.    If  the magnetic  field B  is  constant,  then  this will not happen,  and hence  the 
dipole  feels  no  force  in  a  uniform  field.   However,  if  the  field  is  non-uniform,  such  as  is 
created  by  another  dipole,  then  there  can  be  a  force.    In  general,  the  force  is  quite 
complex, but for a couple of special cases it is simple: 

 

E04-1

1)  If the dipole is aligned with the external field it seeks higher field 
2)  If the dipole is anti-aligned it seeks lower field 

 
 
 
These  rules  can be  easily  remembered  just by  remembering  that  the dipole  always wants 
to  reduce  its  potential  energy.    They  can  also  be  remembered  by  thinking  about  the way 
that the poles of bar magnets interact – opposites attract while likes repel. 
 
In  one  dimension,  when  the  dipole  is  aligned  with  the  field,  a  rather  straight  forward 
mathematical expression may also be derived:

Here it is important to note that the magnitude of the force depends not on the field but on 
the  derivative  of  the  field.    Aligned  dipoles  climb  uphill.    The  steeper  the  hill,  the more 
force they feel.

Figure 1 The Teach Spin Apparatus (a) The Helmholtz apparatus has a tower assembly 
(b) placed along its central axis.  The tower contains a disk magnet which is free to rotate 
(on a gimbal) about an axis perpendicular  to  the  tube and constrained  to move vertically.  
The  amount  of motion  can  be  converted  into  a  force  knowing  the  spring  constant  of  the 
spring. 

 

 

E04-2

The  central  piece  of  equipment  used  in  this  lab  is  the  Teach  Spin  apparatus  (Fig.  1).    It 
consists of  the Helmholtz coil  that you used  in experiment 3, along with a Plexiglas  tube 
containing  a  magnet  on  a  spring.    The  magnet  can  both  rotate  and  move  vertically, 
allowing you to visualize both torques and the forces on dipoles. 
 
It will be useful to recall some results from experiment 3 involving the Helmholtz coil.  
There are three different modes of operation – you can energize just a single coil, both 
coils in parallel (Helmholtz configuration) or both coils anti-parallel (anti-Helmholtz).  
The field profiles (as well as the derivatives of those profiles – necessary for thinking 
about force) look like the following:

2. Power Supply 
 
We will also use the same power supply as in experiment 4 in order to create large 
enough fields in the Helmholtz apparatus to exert a measurable force on the magnet. 
 
 
GENERALIZED PROCEDURE 
 
This lab consists of five main parts.  In each you will observe the effects (torque & force) 
of different magnetic field configurations on the disk magnet (a dipole). 
 
Part 1: Dipole at center of Helmholtz Coil 
You  will  move  the  disk  magnet  to  the  center  of  the  Helmholtz  apparatus  and  randomly 
align it and then see what happens when the coil is energized. 
 
Part 2: Reversing the field 
You will reverse the direction of the field and see what happens. 
 
Part 3: Moving Through the Helmholtz Apparatus 
Here you slowly pull  the disk magnet up  from  the bottom of  the Helmholtz apparatus  (in 
Helmholtz mode) and out through the top, observing any torques or forces on the magnet. 
 
Part 4: Dipole at center of Anti-Helmholtz Coil 
Here you repeat part 1 in anti-Helmholtz configuration 
 
Part 5: Moving Through the Anti-Helmholtz Apparatus 
Here you slowly pull  the disk magnet up  from  the bottom of  the Helmholtz apparatus  (in 
anti-Helmholtz  mode)  and  out  through  the  top,  observing  any  torques  or  forces  on  the 
magnet.

In  this  lab  we  will  have  a  disk  magnet  (a  dipole) 
suspended on  a  spring, which we will use  to observe 
forces  on  dipoles  due  to  different  magnetic  field 
configurations. 
 
(a)  Assuming  we  energize  only  the  top  coil  (current 
running  counter-clockwise  in  the  coil,  creating  the 
field  quoted  above),  and  assuming  that  the  dipole  is 
always  well  aligned  with  the  field  and  on  axis,  what 
is  the  force  on  the  dipole  as  a  function  of  position?  
(HINT:  In this situation  F

µ=
 
(b)  The  disk  magnet  (together  with  its  support)  has 
mass  m,  the  spring  has  spring  constant  k  and  the 
magnet has magnetic moment µ. With the current on, 
we  lift  the brass  rod until  the disk magnet  is  sitting  a 
distance z0 above the top of the coil.  Now the current 
is  turned  off.    How  does  the  magnet  move  once  the 
field is off (give both direction and distance)? 
 
(c)  At  what  height(s)  is  the  force  on  the  dipole  the 
largest? 
 
(d)  What is the force where the field is the largest? 
 
(e)  Our  coils  have  a  radius  R  =  7  cm  and  N  =  168 
turns, and  the experiment  is done with  I = 1 A  in  the 
coil.    The  spring  constant  k  ~  1  N/m,  and µ  ~  0.5  A 
m2.   The mass m ~ 5 g  is  in  the shape of a cylinder ~ 
0.5  cm  in diameter  and ~ 1  cm  long.    If we place  the 
magnet  at  the  location  where  the  spring  is  stretched 
the furthest when the field is on, at about what height 
will the magnet sit after the field is turned off?

2.  Motion of a Dipole in a Helmholtz Field 
 
In  Part  I  of  this  experiment  we  will  place  the  disk  magnet  (a 
dipole  with  moment  µ)  at  the  center  of  the  Helmholtz 
Apparatus  (in  Helmholtz  mode).    We  will  start  with  the  disk 
magnet  aligned  along  the  x-axis  (perpendicular  to  the  central 
z-axis  of  the  coils),  and  then  energize  the  coils with  a  current 
of 1 A. 

R 

R 

 
Recall  that a Helmholtz coil consists of  two coils of  radius R and N  turns each, separated 
by  a distance R,  as pictured  above.   The  field  from each coil  is given at  the beginning of 
the previous problem. 
 
(a)  Will the disk magnet experience a torque, a force or both? 
 
(b)  If the magnet experiences a torque: 
Approximately  how much  time will  it  take  for  the magnet  to  rotate  90º,  so  that  it 
is  aligned  with  the  external  field?    Give  your  answer  first  in  terms  of  an 
approximate  expression  using  R,  N,  I,  and  µ,  and  then  numerically,  using  the 
values given in problem 1e above. 

 
(c)  If the magnet experiences a force: 
Approximately  how  much  time  will  it  take  for  the  magnet  to  move  to  its  new 
equilibrium  position?    Give  your  answer  first  in  terms  of  an  approximate 
expression using R, N,  I, k and µ, and  then numerically, using  the values given  in 
problem 1e above. 

 
Record  the  answers  to  this  question  in  your  notes  as  you  will  be 
asked to compare them to what you observe in the lab.

IN-LAB ACTIVITIES 
 
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
 
1.  Download the LabView file and start up the program. 
2.  Without  leads  connected  to  the power  supply,  turn  it on  and  set  the voltage output  to 
12 V.  Turn the current knob fully counter-clockwise (off). 
3.  Connect the leads to the Helmholtz apparatus, in Helmholtz mode. 
4.  Increase  the  current  to  approximately  1  A,  then  turn  off  the  power  supply  (with  the 
push button – do not change the voltage or current settings). 

 
MEASUREMENTS 
Part 1: Dipole in Helmholtz Mode 
1.  Slide the disk magnet to the center of the Helmholtz apparatus (0 on scale) 
2.  Randomly align the disk magnet using a bar magnet (try to make off axis) 
3.  Turn on the power supply, carefully watching the disk magnet 

 
Question 1: 
Did the disk magnet rotate? (Was there a torque on the magnet?) 
 
 
Question 2: 
Did the spring stretch or compress? (Was there a force on the magnet?) 
 
 
Part 2: Reversing the Leads 
1.  Without  touching  the  apparatus  (or  even  bumping  the  table  –  be  VERY  careful) 
disconnect  the  leads  from  the  power  supply  and  insert  them  in  the  opposite 
direction (flip the current direction). 
2.  Carefully watch the dipole as you do this.  Repeat the experiment several times. 

 
Question 3: 
What  happened  to  the  orientation  of  the  disk  magnet  when  you  change  the  current 
direction in the coils in the Helmholtz configuration?  Is this what you expect?  Why? 

 

E04-7

Part 3: Moving a Dipole Along the Axis of the Helmholtz Apparatus 
1.  Now lower the disk magnet to bottom of the tube 
2.  Slowly  pull  the  disk  magnet  up  through  the  apparatus,  until  it  is  out  the  top.  
While  pulling  watch  both  the  orientation  of  the  magnet  and  the  stretch  or 
compression of the spring.   

 
Question 4: 
Starting  from  the  bottom,  describe  the  direction  of  the  force  (up  or  down)  and  the 
orientation of the disk magnet, paying careful attention to locations where they change. 
 
 
 
 
Question 5: 
Where  does  the  force  appear  to  be  the  largest?    The  smallest?    How  should  you  know 
this? 
 
 
 
Part 4: Dipole in Anti-Helmholtz 
1.  Switch  the  apparatus  to  Anti-Helmholtz  mode  and  increase  the  current  to  2  A.  
Then turn off the power supply.

1.  Now lower the disk magnet to bottom of the tube 
2.  Slowly  pull  the  disk  magnet  up  through  the  apparatus,  until  it  is  out  the  top.

compression of the spring.   

 

Question 8:

orientation of the disk magnet, paying careful attention to locations where they change. 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 9: 
Where  does  the  force  appear  to  be  the  largest?    The  smallest?    How  should  you  know 
this? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Further Questions (for experiment, thought, future exam questions…) 
 
•  What happens as we move through with just a single coil energized?  Is it similar to 
the Helmholtz or anti-Helmholtz?  How is it different? 
•  Are there places where we can put the disk magnet and then randomly orient it 
without either changing the force on it or having a torque rotate it back to alignment 
(in any of the 3 field configurations)? 
If you were to align the disk magnet with the x-axis (perpendicular the coil axis) and 
then center it in anti-Helmholtz mode, would there be a torque or force on it?
