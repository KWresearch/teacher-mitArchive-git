Group Problem: Inductor 
A solenoid has length l, radius a, and N  turns 
1) What is its self-inductance L? 
2) Charge to current I0  then release through 
resistor R.  What is I(t)? 
3) What, as a function of time, is the electric 
field induced on its inner surface? 
4) What is the Poynting vector there? 
5) What is total power exiting (integrate S)? 
6) Where is the power going?  Prove it!
