OBJECTIVES   
 
1.  To explore a particular situation that can lead to a changing magnetic flux through the 
open surface bounded by an electric circuit.

Problem-Solving Strategy for Faraday’s Law 
 
In  Chapter  10  of  the  8.02  Course  Notes,  we  have  seen  that  a  changing  magnetic  flux 
induces an emf: 
 
 
 
according  to  Faraday’s  law  of  induction.  For  a  conductor  that  forms  a  closed  loop,  the

Example:  A Falling Loop 

 

A  rectangular  loop  of  wire  with  mass  m, 
width  w,  vertical  length  l,  and  resistance  R 
falls  out  of  a  magnetic  field  under  the 
influence  of  gravity.    The magnetic  field  is 
uniform  and  out  of  the  paper  (B    =  Bx^   ) 
within the area shown (see sketch) and zero 
outside  of  that  area.    At  the  time  shown  in 
the  sketch,  the  loop  is  exiting  the magnetic

the magnetic field goes to zero is z(t) (see sketch).

Question 5:   Lenz’s Law says that the induced current should be such as to create a self-
magnetic  field  (due  to  the  induced  current  alone)  which  tries  to  keep  things  from 
changing.    What  is  the  direction  of  the  self-magnetic  field  due  to  your  induced  current

the flux through the loop from changing?

quantities?   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 9:    What is the general equation that states that at terminal velocity, the rate at 
which  gravity  is  doing  work  on  the  loop  is  equal  to  the  rate  at  which  energy  is  being 
dissipated  in  the  loop  through  Joule  heating  (the  rate  at  which  a  force  does  work  is
