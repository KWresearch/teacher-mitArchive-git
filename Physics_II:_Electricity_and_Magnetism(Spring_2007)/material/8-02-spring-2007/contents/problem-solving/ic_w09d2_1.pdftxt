IC-W09D3-1 

Group Problem: Solenoid 

Calculate the self-inductance L of a 
solenoid (n turns per meter, length A, 
radius R) 

REMEMBER 
1.  Assume a current I is flowing in your device 
2.  Calculate the B field due to that I 
3.  Calculate the flux due to that B field 
4.  Calculate the self inductance (divide out I)
