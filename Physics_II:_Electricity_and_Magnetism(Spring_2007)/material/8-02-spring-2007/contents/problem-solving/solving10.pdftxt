Problem Solving 10: The Displacement Current and Poynting Vector 

 
OBJECTIVES 
 
1.  To introduce the “displacement current” term that Maxwell added to Ampere’s Law  
 
2.  To find  the magnetic field  inside a charging cylindrical capacitor using  this new  term 
in Ampere’s Law. 

 
3.  To introduce the concept of energy flow through space in the electromagnetic field. 
 
4.  To quantify that energy flow by introducing the Poynting vector. 
 
5.  To  do  a  calculation  of  the  rate  at  which  energy  flows  into  a  capacitor  when  it  is 
charging,  and  show  that  it  accounts  for  the  rate  at which  electric  energy  stored  in  the 
capacitor is increasing.

The Displacement Current 
 
In  magnetostatics  (the  electric  and  magnetic  fields  do  not  change  with  time),  Ampere’s 
law  established  a  relation between  the  line  integral of  the magnetic  field  around  a  closed 
path and  the current  flowing across any open surface with  that closed path as a boundary 
of the open surface,

An Example:  The Charging Capacitor 
 
A  capacitor  consists  of  two  circular  plates  of  radius  a  separated  by  a  distance  d  (assume  
d  <<  a).  The  center  of  each  plate  is  connected  to  the  terminals  of  a  voltage  source  by  a 
thin  wire.  A  switch  in  the  circuit  is  closed  at  time  t  =  0  and  a  current  I(t)  flows  in  the 
dQ t
( )
I t
circuit. The  charge  on  the  plate  is  related  to  the  current  according  to 
.     We 
( )
=
dt
begin  by  calculating  the  electric  field  between  the  plates.  Throughout  this  problem  you 
may ignore edge effects.  We assume that the electric field is zero for r > a.   
 

 

 
Question 1: Use Gauss’ Law to find the electric field between the plates when the charge 
ˆk
on them is Q (as pictured).   The vertical direction is the 
 direction.   
Answer (write your answer to this and subsequent questions on the tear-sheet!): 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Now take an imaginary flat disc of radius r < a inside the capacitor, as shown below.

Question  2:  Using  your  expression  for  E
above,  calculate  the  electric  flux  through  this 
flat  disc  of  radius  r  <  a    in  the  plane  midway  between  the  plates.        Take  the  surface

“Conduction”  current  just  means  the  current  due  to  the  flow  of  real  charge  across  the

Answer: 
 
 
 
 
Since  the  capacitor  plates  have  an  axial  symmetry  and  we  know  that  the  magnetic  field 
due  to a wire  runs  in azimuthal circles about  the wire, we assume  that  the magnetic  field 
between the plates is non-zero, and also runs in azimuthal circles.

Question 7:  If you use your  right  thumb  to point along  the direction of  the electric  field,

The Poynting Vector 
 
Once  a  capacitor  has  been  charged  up,  it  contains  electric  energy.    We  know  that  the 
energy stored  in  the capacitor came from  the battery.   How does  that energy get from  the 
battery  to  the  capacitor?    Energy  flows  through  space  from  the  battery  into  the  sides  of 
the capacitor.  In electromagnetism, the rate of energy flow per  unit area is given  by the 
Poynting vector

 Solving 11-5

Since  the  Poynting  vector  points  radially  into  the  capacitor,  electromagnetic  energy  is 
flowing  into  the  capacitor  through  the  sides.    To  calculate  the  total  energy  flow  into  the 
capacitor,  we  evaluate  the  Poynting  vector  right  at  r  =  a  and  integrate  over  the  sides

Sample Exam Question (If time, try to do this by yourself, closed notes)

).  The  capacitor  is  initially  charged  to  a  charge 
capacitor begins to discharge because we insert a circular resistor of radius a and height d 
between the plates, such that the ends of the resistor make good electrical contact with the 
0t ≥
plates  of  the  capacitor.    The  capacitor  then  discharges  through  this  resistor  for

the  charge  on  the  capacitor  becomes  a  function  of  time  Q(t).      Throughout  this  problem 
you may ignore edge effects.
