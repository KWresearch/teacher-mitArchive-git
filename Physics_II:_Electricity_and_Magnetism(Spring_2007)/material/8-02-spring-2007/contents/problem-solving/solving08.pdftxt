Problem Solving 8: Circuits  
 

OBJECTIVES  
 
1.  To gain  intuition  for  the behavior of DC circuits with both resistors and capacitors or 
inductors.   In  this particular problem solving you will be working with an RC circuit.  
You should carefully consider what would change if the capacitor were replaced with 
an inductor. 

 
2.  To calculate the time dependent currents in such circuits

An RC  circuit  consists  of  both  resistors  and  capacitors,  and  typically  a  battery  to  get  the 
current  flowing.    Capacitors,  when  uncharged,  act  like  pieces  of  wire  (“shorts”)  as  they 
have  no  voltage  drop  across  them.    However,  once  charge  has  flowed  on  to  them  for  a 
while,  they “charge up,” eventually  reaching a potential equal and opposite  that  trying  to 
charge them and effectively preventing the further flow of current.   
 
This  problem  solving  consists  of  two  parts.    In  the  first  you will  answer  a  series  of  short 
questions  developing  your  intuition  for  the  behavior  of  these  circuits  on  short  and  long 
time scales.  In the second part you will work through a quantitative problem. 
 

 
Figure 1:  RC Circuit 
An  RC  circuit  consists  of  two 
resistors,  R1  and  R2,  a  capacitor 
C, a battery ε, and a  switch.   The 
switch  has  been  open  for  a  very 
long  time  before  it  is  closed  at 
time t=0.

Question 4: the currents I1 and I2 (through R1 and R2 respectively) at t=∞? 
 
 
 
 
 
At intermediate time t assume there is a charge q on the capacitor.   
 
Question 6: Using Kirchhoff’s Loop Rules, obtain a differential equation for the charge q 
on  the  capacitor,  assuming  R1=R2=R  (in  other  words,  the  only  current  in  the  equation 
should be the current through the capacitor, which can be rewritten in terms of dq/dt).

q on  the  capacitor  after  the  switch has been opened,  assuming R1=R2=R  (in other words,
