PROBLEM SOLVING STRATEGIES (see Section 5.9, 8.02 Course Notes)  
 
(1) Using Gauss’s Law, calculate the electric field everywhere. 
 
(2) Compute the electric potential difference ∆V between the two conductors. 
 
(3) Calculate the capacitance C using 
 
The Cylindrical Capacitor:

Two concentric cylinders have  radii a and b and height  l, with b > a.   The  inner cylinder 
carries total charge -Q, and the outer cylinder carries total charge Q.     
We ignore end effects. 
 
Note  that  you  have  recently  calculated  the  capacitance  of  a  cylindrical  capacitor  in 
the pre-lab  to  experiment  #2.   You  are  asked  to  repeat  this  calculation here both  to 
ensure  that  you  know  how  to  and  to  prepare  for  the  newer  material  of  calculating 
stored energy.  Move quickly through the capacitance calculation!

Question 3:  Calculating Capacitance 
 
Our  two  conducting  cylinders  form  a  capacitor.    The  magnitude  of  the  charge,  Q ,  on 
either cylinder is related to the magnitude of the voltage difference between the cylinders 
∆  where  ∆V  is the voltage difference across the capacitor and  C  
according to  Q C V
=
is  the  constant  of  proportionality  called  the  ‘capacitance’. The  capacitance  is  determined 
by  the  geometrical  properties  of  the  two  conductors  and  is  therefore  independent  of  the 
applied voltage difference across the cylinders.   
 
What is the capacitance  C  of our system of two cylinders? Express your answer in terms, 
a
b
, the height l,  and any other constants which you may find necessary.

Starting from your expression for E in question (1), calculate this electrostatic energy and 
a b
express your answer  in  terms of Q, 
, and  l   (and any other constants which you may 
, 
find  necessary).  If  you  use  your  expression  for  C  from  question  3  above,  can  you  write 
you expression in terms of Q and C alone?  What is that expression?

Question 5:   Charging the Capacitor 
 
Suppose  instead  of  using  a  battery  we  charge  the  capacitor  ourselves  in  the  following 
way.    We  move  charge  from  the  inside  of  the  cylinder  at    r  =  b  to  the  surface  of  the 
cylinder at r = a.   Suppose we start off with zero charge on  the conductors and we move 
charge for awhile until at time t we have built up a change q(t) on the inner cylinder.   
 

a.  What  is  the  voltage  difference  between  the  two  cylinders  at  time  t,  in  terms  of C 
and q(t)?   

 
b.  Now  we  move  a  very  little  additional  charge  dq  from  the  outer  to  the  inner 
cylinder.  How much work dW do we have to do to move that dq from the outer to 
the  inner  cylinder,  in  the  presence  of  the  charge q(t)  already  there,  in  terms  of C, 
q(t), and dq? 

 
c.  Using  your  result  in  (b),  calculate  the  total  work  we  have  to  do  to  bring  a  total 
charge  Q  from  the  outer  to  the  inner  cylinder,  assuming  the  cylinders  start  out 
uncharged (Hint:  integrate with respect to dq from 0 to Q).   

 
d.  Is the work we did in charging the capacitor greater than, equal to, or less than the 
stored  electrostatic  energy  in  the  capacitor  that  you  calculated  in  question  4?  
Why?
