REFERENCE:  Section 4.2, 8.02 Course Notes. 
 
Introduction 
 
When approaching Gauss’s Law problems, we described a problem solving strategy summarized 
below (see also, Section 4.7, 8.02 Course Notes):  
 

Summary: Methodology for Applying Gauss’s Law 

Step 1:  Identify the ‘symmetry’ properties of the charge distribution. 
 
Step 2:  Determine the direction of the electric field 
 
Step 3:  Decide how many different regions of space the charge distribution determines 
 
For each region of space… 
 
Step 4:  Choose  a  Gaussian  surface  through  each  part  of  which  the  electric  flux  is  either 
constant or zero 

 
Step 5:  Calculate the flux through the Gaussian surface (in terms of the unknown E) 
 
Step 6:  Calculate the charge enclosed in the choice of the Gaussian surface 
 
Step 7:  Equate  the  two  sides  of  Gauss’s  Law  in  order  to  find  an  expression  for  the 
magnitude of the electric field 

 
Then… 
 
Step 8:  Graph  the  magnitude  of  the  electric  field  as  a  function  of  the  parameter  specifying 
the Gaussian surface for all regions of space. 

 

 

 
You should now apply this strategy to the following problem.
