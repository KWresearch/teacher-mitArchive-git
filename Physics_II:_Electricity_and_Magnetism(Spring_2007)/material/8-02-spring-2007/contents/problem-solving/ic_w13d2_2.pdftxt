Group Problem: Capacitor 
IC-W14D1-2 

A circular capacitor of 
spacing d and radius R  is 
in a circuit carrying the 
steady current i shown. 

At time t=0 it is uncharged 

1.  Find the electric field E(t) at P vs. time t (mag. & dir.) 
2.  Find the magnetic field B(t) at P 
3.  Find the Poynting vector S(t) at P 
4.  What is the total power flux into/out of the capacitor? 
5.  Does this make sense?  How? (Hint:  Whatâ€™s U?)
