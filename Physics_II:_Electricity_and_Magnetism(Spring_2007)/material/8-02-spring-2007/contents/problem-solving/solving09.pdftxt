Problem Solving 9: Driven LRC Circuits 
 
OBJECTIVES 
 
1.  To  explore  the  relationship  between  driven  current  and  driving  emf  in  three  simple 
circuits  that  contain:  (1)  only  resistance;  (2)  only  inductance;  and  (3)  only 
capacitance. 

 
2.  To  examine  these  same  relationships  in  the  general  case  where  R,  L,  and  C  are  all 
present, and to do two sample problems on the LRC circuits.

General Properties of Driven LRC Circuits 
  
An  LRC  circuit  is  the  electrical  analog  of  a  mass  on  a  spring.    We  distinguish  two 
behaviors.    In  the  first, we  consider  its  “free”  oscillations  that  occur when we  “kick”  the 
circuit  (charge  the  capacitor or  send  a  constant  current  through)  and  then  stand back  and 
watch  it oscillate.   If we do  this we will see a natural frequency of oscillation  that decays 
in a finite time.   
 
A second behavior emerges if we “drive” the LRC circuit with a source of emf with some 
(arbitrary)  amplitude  and  frequency.  If we drive  the  circuit with  an  emf

where  ω  is  any  frequency  we  desire  (we  get  to  pick  this)  and 
  is  any  amplitude  we 
desire, then the “driven” response of the system is given by

Note  the  “driven”  response  is  at  the  (arbitrary)  frequency  of  the  driver,  and  not  at  the 
natural  frequency  of  the  system.    However  the  system  will  show  maximum  response  to 
the  driving  emf  when  the  driving  frequency  is  at  the  natural  frequency  of  oscillation  of 
1 / LC

Sample  Problem 1 
 
The  circuit  shown  below  contains  an  AC  generator  which  provides  a  source  of 
sinusoidally  varying  emf ε(t)  = ε0  sinωt,  a  resistor with  resistance  R,  and  a  "black  box", 
which  contains  either  an  inductor  or  a  capacitor,  but  not  both.    The  amplitude  of  the 
driving  emf,    ε0,  is  100 2   Volts,  and  the  angular  frequency  ω    is  10  rad/sec.    We 
measure  the  current  in  the  circuit  and  find  that  it  is  given  as  a  function  of  time  by  the 
expression:   I(t) = (10 Amps) sin(ωt  + π/4)     [Note:  π/4 radians = 45 ° , tan (π/4) = +1].

The  circuit  shown  below  contains  an  AC  generator  which  provides  a  source  of 
sinusoidally varying emf ε(t) = ε0 sin(ωt), a resistor with resistance R = 3 Ω, and a "black 
box",  which  contains  either  an  inductor  or  a  capacitor,  or  both.    The  amplitude  of  the 
driving emf, ε0,    is 6 Volt.   We measure  the current  in  the circuit at an angular  frequency 
ω    =1  radians/sec  and  find  that  it  is  exactly  in  phase with  the  driving  emf.   We measure 
the  current  in  the  circuit  at  an  angular  frequency ω =  2  radians/sec  and  find  that  it  is  out 
of phase with the driving emf by exactly π/4 radians.  
 
Question  13:    What  does  the  black

Sample Exam Question (If time, try to do this by yourself, closed notes) 
A circuit consists of a battery with emf V, an  inductor L, a capacitor C, and  two resistors, 
each with  resistance R, as  shown  in  the  sketch.     The  capacitor  is  initially uncharged  and 
there  is  no  current  flowing  anywhere  in  the  circuit.    The  switch  S  has  been  open  for  a 
long time, and is then closed, as shown in the diagram.    

 
(a)    Using  Kirchhoff’s  Loop  Rule  as  modified  for  inductors,  what  is  the  sum  of  the 
potential drops around the outer loop (the loop including both the emf and the inductor) if 
we move clockwise around the loop? 
 
 
 
 
 
(b)    Just  after  the  switch  S  is  closed,  what  are  the  currents  i1,  i2,  and  i3  in  terms  of  the 
given quantities?   Assume that the left loop of the circuit has zero inductance. You do 
not have to solve any differential equations to answer this question. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(c)   A  long,  long  time  after  switch  S  is  closed, what  are  the  currents  i1,  i2,  and  i3?   You 
do not have to solve any differential equations to answer this question.
