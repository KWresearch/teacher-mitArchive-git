Example 1 :  Magnetic Field of a Cylindrical Shell 
 
We now apply this strategy to the following problem.   Consider the cylindrical conductor 
with a hollow center and copper walls of thickness b – a as shown .  The radii of the inner 
and  outer  walls  are  a  and  b  respectively,  and  the  current  I  is  uniformly  spread  over  the 
cross section of the copper (shaded region).  We want to calculate the magnetic field in the 
region a < r < b.    
 
Problem Solving Strategy Step  
(1) Identify Symmetry 
Either circular or rectangular 
 
(2) Determine Direction 
Clockwise or ccw? 
 
(3) How many regions? 
Three:  r<a; a<r<b; r>b 
 
(4) Draw Amperian Loop: 
Here  we  take  a  loop  that  is  a  circle 
of  radius  r  with  a  <  r  <  b  (see 
figure).     
 
(5) Current enclosed by Amperian Loop: 
 
The next step is to calculate the current enclosed by this imaginary Amperian loop.   
There are typically two ways to do this.  One way is to simply calculate it as a fraction of 
the  total  current.    The  second  is  to  first  calculate  the  current  density  J  (current  per  unit 
area) and then multiply by the area enclosed.  You should use both methods and compare. 
 
Question  1  (write  your  answer  on  the  tear-sheet  at  the  end): What  is  the magnitude  of 
the  current per unit  area  J  in  the  region  a <  r < b?   Remember we  are  assuming  that  the 
current  I  is  uniformly  spread  over  the  area  a  <  r  <  b,  and  also  remember  that  current 
density  J  is  defined  as  the  current  per  unit  area.    Once  you  have  the  current  density, 
calculate the total current enclosed by the Amperian loop. 
 
 
 
 
Question 2  (write your answer on  the  tear-sheet at  the end): What  is  the  fraction of  the 
total area that is enclosed by the Amperian Loop?  What is the total current it encloses? 
 
 
Question 3 (write your answer on  the  tear-sheet at  the end): Your answer above should 
be zero when r = a and I when r = b (why?).  Does your answer have these properties?

and has thickness d in the y-direction.
