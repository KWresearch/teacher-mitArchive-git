Introduction 

The Huygens Principle states that every unobstructed point on a wavefront will act a source of  a 
secondary  spherical  wave.  We  add  to  this  principle,  the  Superposition  Principle  that  the 
amplitude  of  the  wave  at  any  point  beyond  the  initial  wave  front  is  the  superposition  of  the 
amplitudes of all the secondary waves.

When  ordinary  light  is  emitted  from  two  different  sources  and  passes  through  two  narrow  slits, 
the  plane  waves  do  not  maintain  a  constant  phase  relation  and  so  the  light  will  show  no 
interference  patterns  in  the  region  beyond  the  openings.  In  order  for  an  interference  pattern  to 
develop, the incoming light must satisfy two conditions: 
•	 The  light  sources  must  be  coherent.  This  means  that  the  plane  waves  from  the  sources 
must maintain a constant phase relation. 

•	 The light must be monochromatic. This means that the light has just one wavelength. 

When  the  coherent  monochromatic  laser  light  falls  on  two  slits  separated  by  a  distance 
,  the 
away  from 
emerging  light will produce an  interference pattern on a viewing screen a distance 
the center of the slits. The geometry of the double slit interference is shown in the figure below. 

Figure 2: Double slit interference 

Consider light that falls on the screen at a point 
that lies on the 
from the point 
a distance 
from  the  double  slit  system.  The  light  from  the  slit  2  will 
screen  a  perpendicular  distance 
travel an extra distance 
than the light from slit 1. This extra distance is 
to the point 
called the path length.
