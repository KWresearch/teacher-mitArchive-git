Part I.  Coordinate Systems 
In  8.02 we  regularly  use  three  different  coordinate  systems:    rectangular  (Cartesian),  cylindrical 
and spherical.  In order to become familiar with the unit vectors for each of those systems, take a 
minute  to explore  the online visualizations  .   Go  to the Vector Fields page  and  select  the

asking  how  the  function  changes  as  you  change  one  of  its  independent  variables  (while  holding 
the others fixed – treat them as constants when you take the derivative).

Part III.  Multivariable Integration 
 
Although we frequently use  integration  in 8.02,  the  integrals we do  tend  to be VERY easy (most 
things are constant and pull straight out of the integral).  Where students typically have problems 
is in not understanding the concept of integration and how to set up the integral.  Below we focus 
on  the  types  of  integrals  used  in  this  class.    If  you  find  yourself  doing  “a  lot  of math”  then  you 
probably aren’t doing it right.  We leave the math intensive problems to 18.02. 
 
A. Concept:  Integration as Summing the Pieces 
In single variable calculus the definite integral of a function is often written:  

b
∫
a
The  dx  is  a  differential  –  a  small  length  of  the  x  axis  –  and  to  many  seems  to  be  merely  a 
notational  requirement,  like  an  appendage  of  the  integral.    I  encourage  you  to  think  of  the 
differential  as  the  most  important  part  of  the  integral,  and  to  start  every  integral  with  ONLY  a 
differential.    For  example,  if  you  want  to  know  the  total  charge  Q  on  some  strangely  shaped 
dQ= ∫
object with a given charge density, you would want to write:  Q
.  If you want to know the 
= ∫∫
. 
area of some surface you would start  A
dA
What have we achieved by doing this, you might ask?  We have decided that in order to find out 
the total value of something (the charge or the area in the two examples above) we need to break 
it up into parts and add up the contributions from each of those parts.  The differential (e.g. dQ or 
dA)  is some very small piece of  the whole  that  (1) we can easily write down and  (2) provides us 
some way to move through all the pieces of that whole.

dA

=

( )

 

To calculate the area we write: 

Example 1 
Suppose  we  want  to  find  the  area  under  a  function  f(x) 
between  x  =  a  and  x  =  b.    To  do  this  we  break  the  total 
area  A  into  a  number  of  small  rectangles  of  width  dx  and 
height f(x).  The area of each of these little rectangles dA is 
easily written (its just the area of a rectangle):   
dA = f(x) dx. 
b
∫∫
∫
a
Our choice of dA obeyed our two rules:  it was easy to write down (we know the area of 
rectangles) and by adding up the area of such rectangles as we walk x from a to b we will get the 
value of the whole area. 
 
B. Notation:  Multivariable Integration 
 
When  we  move  to  integrals  of  multivariable  functions  we  need  some  new  notation.    Instead  of 
only  having  one  straight  axis we  can walk  along  (i.e.  the  x  axis  in  the  above  example),  in  three 
dimensions we can walk along curves (one dimensional objects), surfaces (2D) or volumes (3D).  
For each new dimension we need a new variable  to  tell us where we are on  the object – a  single 
variable, distance from the end, tells you where you are on a curve, but two variables are needed 
to tell you where you are on a surface – and hence an extra integral sign.  So we have: 
 
 
 
 
 
For  line and surface  integrals we have one more notational convention.   We distinguish between 
“open” and “closed” curves and  surfaces.   Closed  curves  are  those where  the beginning  and  end 
points  are  the  same  (the  perimeter  of  a  circle  is  closed,  a  line  isn’t).    Closed  surfaces  are  those 
that  completely  contain  volume  (a  spherical  shell  is  closed,  a  plane  isn’t).   We  indicate  that  we 
are integrating over a closed curve or surface by putting a circle over the integral sign: 
= ∫(cid:118)
= ∫∫(cid:119)  
 
Closed Line Integral:  s
d  
Closed Surface Integral: 
dA
A
s
This  distinction  is  irrelevant  for  doing  the  integral,  but  helps  in  remembering  the  shape  over 
which you are integrating. 
 
C. Differentials in different coordinate systems 
 
A  final  piece  of  useful  information  is  how  to  break  an  object  up  into  small  pieces  in  different 
coordinate systems.  In rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates, the geometry is very straightforward.  
Distances  (for  line  integrals)  tend  to have ds = dx  (or dy or dz).   Areas are  just  squares  (dA = dx 
dy or dx dz …).  Volumes are just cubes (dV = dx dy dz).   
 
Pictures are helpful for finding similar quantities in cylindrical and spherical coordinates:

Figure 2:  Differential dimensions in rectangular, cylindrical & spherical coordinate systems. 
Cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z) has differential “cube” of sides dρ, ρdφ and dz 
Spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ) has differential “cube” of sides dr, rdθ and rsinθ dφ 

 
In  addition  to  integrating  over  these  small  differential  cubes,  it  is  often  convenient  to  integrate 
over larger differential objects.  For example,  in example 1 we wrote dA = f(x) dx and integrated 
only  in  x,  rather  than writing dA = dx dy  and  integrating  from  y = 0  to  f(x)  and  then over x.   We 
essentially did the dy integral in our head, because it was straightforward.

D. Charge Density:  An Example of Integrating Scalar Functions 
 
Instead  of  being  confined  to  a  point,  charge  is  often  distributed  over  objects,  either  uniformly 
(with constant charge density) or with some position dependent charge density.   For 1- 2- and 3-
dimensional objects we us different symbols for charge density:

E. Line Integrals of Vector Functions dotted into Displacement 
 
In  addition  to  integrating  scalar  functions,  we  often  integrate  vector  functions  which  are  dotted 
into  some  distance.    This  dot  product  is  then  a  scalar  function,  and  we  integrate  just  as  above.  
(cid:71)
For  example,  if  an  object moves  a  distance  ds(cid:71)
 while  a  force  F
 acts  on  it, we  say  that  the  force 
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
= ⋅F s
does  work  dW
d
.    If  the  object  then moves  along  a  path,  we  can  calculate  the  total  work 
done by the force while the object was moving as: 
 

 

W

=

dW

=

∫

(cid:71)
(cid:71)

The  dot  product  indicates  that  only  the  part  of  the  force  pushing  along  the  displacement 
contributes to the total work done.

D. Surface Integrals of Vector Functions dotted into Normals:  Flux 
 
In  two  dimensions,  the  equivalent  of  the  question  we  just  asked  in  1D  –  “how  much  does  this 
vector field point along the path we are integrating along?” – is “how much does this vector field 
push  through  the  surface  we  are  integrating  over?”    This  quantity  is  called  the  flux,  and  for  a

It’s  the  same  for  the  disk  and  the  hemisphere,  just  as  it  should  be  –  the  same  amount  of  water 
must pass through both of them because they both completely cover the cross-section of the pipe, 
so all water that flows through one must flow through the other.
