Problem Solving 6: Magnetic Force & Torque  
 

OBJECTIVES  
 
1.  To  look at  the behavior of a charged particle  in a uniform magnetic  field by  studying 
the operation of a mass spectrometer 

 
2.  To  calculate  the  torque  on  a  rectangular  loop  of  current-carrying  wire  sitting  in  an 
external magnetic field. 

 
3.  To  define  the  magnetic  dipole  moment  of  a  loop  of  current-carrying  wire  and  write 
the torque on the loop in terms of that vector and the external magnetic field.

Mass Spectrometer 
 

A mass spectrometer consists of an ionizer, which strips (ideally) a single electron 
from  an  atom whose mass  you want  to measure,  an  acceleration  region,  and  a  deflection 
region, as pictured in Fig. 1.

In Figure 1,  the  ions exit  the  ionizer at essentially zero velocity.   They are accelerated by 
a  potential  difference  through  the  accelerator  region,  where  they  enter  the  deflector 
region  through  a  small  orifice  (X).    The  deflector  region  has  a  uniform  B  field  which 
bends  the  ions  around  through  another  small  orifice  into  the  counter,  where  the  ions  are 
counted.    By  scanning  the  accelerating  voltage  ∆V  a  range  of  masses  (or,  more 
accurately,  mass  to  charge  ratios)  can  be  measured,  to  determine  the  content  of  some 
unknown gas.

Question  1  (Answer  this  and  subsequent  questions  on  the  tear-off  sheet  at  the  end):  
What should the polarity of the potential difference ∆V be (should it be positive at the top 
near the deflector or at the bottom near the ionizer)?   
 
 
 
 
Question 2:  In what direction should the magnetic field be pointed to guide the ions into 
the counter? 
 
 
 
 
Question  3:      Find  an  expression  for  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  ions  at  the  instant  they 
enter the deflector region. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 4:   What path do  the  ions follow  in  the deflector region?   Derive an expression 
for  the  magnetic  field  that  is  needed  to  make  sure  that  ions  of  mass  m  end  up  in  the 
counter (a distance D away from where they enter the deflector region). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 5:  About what potential ∆V is needed to get singly ionized carbon-12 ions into 
the  counter  if  B  =  1 T  and D  =  20  cm?   You  can  assume  that  protons  and  neutrons  have 
about the same mass given by mc2 ~ 1 GeV.

Magnetic Dipole Moment 
 
In  class  we  determined  that  a  planar  loop  of  area  A  (with  unit  vector 
µ(cid:71)
loop) and carrying current I, has a magnetic dipole moment 
 given by:

your right hand in the direction of the current in the loop.

Problem:   A square  loop of wire, of  length  on each side, pivots about an axis AA'  that 
corresponds  to  a horizontal  side of  the  square,  as  shown  in Figure 4. A magnetic  field of 
magnitude  B  is  directed  vertically  downward,  and  uniformly  fills  the  region  in  the 
vicinity of the loop.  A current I flows around the loop.

Question  6:    Calculate  the  magnitude  of  the  torque  on  this  loop  of  wire  in  terms  of  the 
quantities given, using our expressions above.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
Question  7:  In  what  direction  does  the  current  need  to  flow  in  order  “levitate“  the  coil 
again the force of gravity (clockwise or counterclockwise viewed from above)? 
 
 
 
 

 
Question 8: Suppose that the loop ((cid:65) = 1 m) is essentially massless, but that a small child 
(m = 20 kg) wants  to hang  from  the bottom rung of  the  loop and be supported at θ = 45º.  
If  we  can  push  I  =  100  A  through  the  loop,  about  how  large  a  B  field  will  we  need  to 
support the child? 
 

 
 

 

 
 
 
Question 9: Now suppose  the child starts fidgeting, causing  the angle  to slightly change.  
If  the deviation  is  initially  small, will  the  forces  tend  to cause  the motion  to  run  to  larger 
excursions  (i.e.  to  fall  to  θ  =  0º  or  to  snap  up  to  θ  =  90º)  or  will  they  tend  to  restore  to 
45º?    If  the  former,  about  how  long  will  it  take  to  fall/rise?    If  the  latter,  what  is  the 
frequency  of  small  oscillations  of  the  angle  about  θ =  45º?   HINT:   You  can  expand  the

cos(x)  ~  1.    At  45º  the  two  components  of  the  torque  are  equal  and  opposite,  so  rewrite 
the  total  torque  in  terms of gravity g and  length (cid:65).   And,  finally,  the moment of  inertia of 
a point mass a distance (cid:65) from a pivot is m(cid:65)2. 
 
 
 
 
 
Question  10:    If  instead  of  balancing  the  child  at  45º  they  wanted  to  ride  at  60º,  is  it 
better to keep the field vertical or to switch to horizontal (i.e. which requires smaller B)?
