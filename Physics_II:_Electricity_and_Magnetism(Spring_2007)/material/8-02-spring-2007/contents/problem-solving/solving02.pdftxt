Problem Solving 2: Continuous Charge Distributions 

 
OBJECTIVES  
 
1.  To look at the meaning of linear, area, and volume charge densities 
 
2.  To calculate the electric field from a line of charge along two different directions. 
 
3.  To  examine  the  limiting  behavior  of  the  two  expressions when  the  length  of  the  line  goes  to 
zero, to make sure we recover the results we expect.

PROBLEM SOLVING STRATEGIES 
 
In order  to calculate  the electric  field created by a continuous charge distribution we must break 
the  charge  into  a  number  of  small  pieces  dq,  each  of  which  create  an  electric  field  dE.    For 
example, if the charge is to be broken into point charges, we can write: 
 

(cid:71)
E

where   r is  the  distance  from  
dq
 to    (where  we  are  finding  E
P
vector. In general, use the following steps 
 
(cid:71)
(1) Break your charge distribution into small pieces dq that you know the 
 field from 
E
(cid:71)
dE
(2) Write  out  the  appropriate
 for  the  dq.    For  example,  for  point  charges  we  will  use 
(cid:71)

(5)  Specify an appropriate coordinate system (Cartesian, cylindrical or spherical) and express the 
differential  element  (  dl,  dA  or  dV  )  and  r  in  terms  of  the  coordinates  (see    Table  2.1  below 
for a summary.).  If you need a review of the various coordinate systems, see Review Module

PROBLEM 1: Continuous Charge Densities 
 
Question  1  (Answer  on  the  tear-sheet  at  the  end!):  A  cylindrical  shell  of  length  L  and  radius

.     We only place charge on  the  sides 
 Q
of the cylinder.  The end caps of the cylinder have no charge.

Check units! 

 
b.  Suppose you go very  far  away  from  the  cylinder  to  a distance much greater  than R.   The 
cylinder  now  looks  like  a  line  of  charge.    What  is  the  linear  charge  density λof  that 
apparent line of charge?  Check units!

The  next  two  problems  both  deal  with  the  electric  field  of  a  line  of  charge.    We  can  only 
calculate  that  field  analytically  along  two  lines  in  space,  both  of  which  we  do  here.    At  other 
points we must  do  a  numerical  calculation.    To  see  a  global  representation  of what  that  electric 
field 
looks

everywhere,
