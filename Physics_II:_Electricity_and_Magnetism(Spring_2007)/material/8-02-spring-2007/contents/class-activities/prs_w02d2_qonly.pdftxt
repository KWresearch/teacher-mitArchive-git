Spherical Shell 

PRS05 

We just saw that in a solid sphere of 

charge the electric field grows 
linearly with distance. 
Inside the charged 
spherical shell at left 
(r<a) what does the 
electric field do? 

a 

Q 

1.  Constant and Zero 
2.  Constant but Non-Zero 
3.  Still grows linearly 
4.  Some other functional form 
(use Gauss’ Law to determine) 
5.  Can’t determine with Gauss Law
