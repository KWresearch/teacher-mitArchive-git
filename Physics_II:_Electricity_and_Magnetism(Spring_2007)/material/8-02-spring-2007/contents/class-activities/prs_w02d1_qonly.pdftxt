 
Masses in Potentials 

PRS04 

 
 

 
Consider 3 equal masses sitting in 
different gravitational potentials: 
A) Constant, zero potential 
B) Constant, non-zero potential 
C) Linear potential (V ∝ x) but 
sitting at V = 0 

 
Which statement is true?  
1.  None of the masses will accelerate 
2.  Only B will accelerate 
3.  Only C will accelerate 
4.  All masses will accelerate, but B 
will have the largest acceleration 
5.  All masses will accelerate, but C 
will have the largest acceleration

Positive Charge 
 
Place a positive charge in an electric 
field.  It will move from 
 
1. higher to lower electric potential; 
lower to higher potential energy 
 
2. higher to lower electric potential; 
higher to lower potential energy 
 
3. lower to higher electric potential; 
lower to higher potential energy 
 
4. lower to higher electric potential; 
higher to lower potential energy 
 

 
Negative Charge 

PRS04 

 
 

 
Place a negative charge in an 
electric field.  It will move from 
 
1. higher to lower electric potential; 
lower to higher potential energy 
 
2. higher to lower electric potential; 
higher to lower potential energy 
 
3. lower to higher electric potential; 
lower to higher potential energy 
 
4. lower to higher electric potential; 
higher to lower potential energy

Potential and Energy 

 
Which is true? 
I.   It takes positive work to bring 
like charges together. 
II. Electric field lines always point 
in the direction of decreasing 
electric potential. 
III. If a negative charge moves in 
the direction of the electric field, 
its potential energy decreases. 
1. II only. 
2. II and III only. 
3. I, II and III. 
4. I and II only. 
5. I only. 
 

 
Two Point Charges

The work done in moving a positive 
test charge from infinity to the point 
P midway between two charges of 
magnitude +q and –q: 

+q 

P 

-q 

 

1. is positive. 
2. is negative. 
3. is zero. 
4. can not be determined since not 
enough information is given. 
5. I don’t know 

 
Potential Landscape 

PRS04 

 
 

 
If I think of the electric potential as 
a mountain range, then the electric 
field points: 
 
1) Up the mountain sides 
2) Down the mountain sides 
3) Around the mountain sides 
4) I don’t know
