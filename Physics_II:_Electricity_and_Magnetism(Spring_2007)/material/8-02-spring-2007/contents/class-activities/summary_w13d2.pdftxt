Topic Introduction 

Today’s class continues the discussion of electromagnetic waves from last class. We will also 
show  that  the Poynting vector applies  to situations other  than  just EM waves,  in particular  to 
the flow of energy in circuits.

(1) Gauss’s Law states that electric charge creates diverging electric fields.   
(2) Magnetic Gauss’s Law states that there are no magnetic charges (monopoles).   
(3)  Faraday’s  Law  states  that  changing  magnetic  fields  induce  electric  fields  (which  curl 
around the changing flux). 
(4)  Ampere-Maxwell’s  Law  states  that  magnetic  fields  are  created  both  by  currents  and  by 
changing electric fields, and that in each case the field curls around its creator.   

Electromagnetic Radiation 
The  fact  that  changing magnetic  fields  create  electric  fields  and  that  changing  electric  fields 
create  magnetic  fields  means  that  oscillating  electric  and  magnetic  fields  can  propagate 
through  space  (each  pushing  forward  the  other).  This  is  electromagnetic  (EM)  radiation.    It 
is  the  single  most  useful  discovery  we  discuss  in  this  class,  not  only  allowing  us  to 
understand natural phenomena, like light, but also to create EM radiation to carry a variety of 
useful  information:    radio, broadcast  television and cell phone  signals,  to name a  few, are all 
EM  radiation. 
In  order  to  understand  the  mathematics  of  EM  radiation  you  need  to 
understand  how  to  write  an  equation  for  a  traveling  wave  (a  wave  that  propagates  through 
space as a  function of  time).   Any  function  that  is written  f(x-vt) satisfies  this property.   As  t 
increases, a  function of  this  form moves  to  the  right  (increasing x) with velocity v.   You can 
see  this  as  follows:    At  t=0  f(0)  is  at  x=0.    At  a  later  time  t=t,  f(0)  is  at  x=vt.    That  is,  the 
function has moved a distance vt during a time t. 

Sinusoidal  traveling waves  (plane waves)  look  like waves both  as  a  function of position  and 
as  a  function of  time.    If you  sit  at one position  and watch  the wave  travel by you  say  that  it 
has  a  period  T, 
f,  and  angular 
inversely 
related 
to 
its 
frequency 
frequency, 
ω(T  =  f  = 2πω  ) .  If instead you freeze time and look at a wave as a function of position, 
−1
−1 
you say  that  it has a wavelength λ,  inversely  related  to  its wavevector k  (λ = 2π k  ) .  Using 
−1
this notation, we can rewrite our function f(x-vt) = f0sin(kx-ωt), where v = ω/k. 

We typically treat both electric and magnetic fields as plane waves as they propagate through  

space  (if  you  have  one  you  must  have  the  other).    They  travel  at  the  speed  of  light  (v=c).

They also obey two more constraints.  First, their magnitudes are fixed relative to each other: 
E0  =  cB0  (check  the  units!)  Secondly,  E  &  B  always  oscillate  at  right  angles  to  each  other 
and  to  their  direction  of  propagation  (they  are  transverse  waves).    That  is,  if  the  wave  is 
traveling  in  the  z-direction,  and  the  E  field  points  in  the  x-direction  then  the  B  field  must 
point  along  the  y-direction.  More  generally we write  E Bˆ
 =  ˆ

p , where  ˆ
p is  the  direction  of

propagation. 

Energy and the Poynting Vector 
As EM Waves  travel  through  space  they carry energy with  them.   This  is clearly  true –  light 
from  the  sun  warms  us  up.    It  also  makes  sense  in  light  of  the  fact  that  energy  is  stored  in 
electric  and  magnetic  fields,  so  if  those  fields  move  through  space  then  the  energy  moves 
with  them.    It  turns  out  that  we  can  describe  how much  energy  passes  through  a  given  area

per unit  time by  the Poynting Vector:      S =  1  E × B .  Note  that  this points  in  the direction of 
µ0 
propagation of  the EM waves  (from above) which makes sense –  the energy  is carried  in  the 
same  direction  that  the  waves  are  traveling.    The  Poynting  Vector  is  also  useful  in  thinking 
about  energy  in  circuit  components.    For  example,  consider  a  cylindrical  resistor.    The 
current  flows  through  it  in  the  direction  that  the  electric  field  is  pointing.    The  B  field  curls 
around.  The  Poynting  vector  thus  points  radially  into  the  resistor  –  the  resistor  consumes 
energy.  We will repeat this exercise for capacitors and inductors in class.
