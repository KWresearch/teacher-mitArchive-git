Changing C Dimensions 
A parallel-plate capacitor has plates 
with equal and opposite charges ±Q, 
separated by a distance d, and is not 
connected to a battery.  The plates 
are pulled apart to a distance D > d.  
What happens to the potential 
difference V and the charge Q? 
1.  V increases,  Q increases 
2.  V decreases,  Q increases 
3.  V is the same, Q increases 
4.  V increases,  Q is the same 
5.  V decreases,  Q is the same 
6.  V is the same, Q is the same 
7.  V increases,  Q decreases 
8.  V decreases,  Q decreases 
9.  V is the same,  Q decreases

A parallel-plate capacitor, 
disconnected from a battery, has 
plates with equal and opposite 
charges, separated by a distance d.  
Suppose the plates are pulled apart 
until separated by a distance D > d.  
How does the final electrostatic 
energy stored in the capacitor 
compare to the initial energy? 
 
1. The final stored energy is smaller 
2. The final stored energy is larger 
3. Stored energy does not change.
