Exam 2 Information 

 

TEST TWO Thursday Evening 7:30- 9:30 pm.  The Friday class immediately 
following is canceled because of the evening exam. 
 
What We Expect From You On The Exam 

 
(1) An understanding of how to calculate magnetic fields in highly symmetric situations 
using Ampere’s Law, e.g. as in the Ampere’s Law Problem Solving Session.  

 
(2)  An  understanding  of  how  to  use  Faraday’s  Law  in  problems  involving  the  generation  of 
induced EMF's. You  should be  able  to  formulate quantitative  answers  to questions  about 
energy  considerations  in  Faraday’s  Law  problems,  e.g.  the  power  going  into  ohmic 
dissipation comes from the decreasing kinetic energy of a rolling rod, etc. 

 
(3) An understanding of the nature of the motion of an electric charge in constant magnetic 
and electric fields, including in “crossed-fields,” i.e. when E is perpendicular to B.  
 
(4) An understanding of how to calculate the magnetic fields of moving charges or current 
elements using the Biot-Savart law, e.g.

(5) An understanding of how to calculate the forces and torques on a current element in an 
external magnetic field or on a charge moving in an external magnetic field, including the 
characteristics of cyclotron motion. That is, to understand and be able to apply the 
equations

(6) An understanding of the magnetic moment vector of a current loop. A conceptual 
understanding of how the torque exerted on a magnetic dipole in an external field arises,

and how to derive the expression for this torque ( = ×
). Also, a conceptual 
understanding of how the force exerted on a magnetic dipole in a non-uniform external 
magnetic field arises.  

 
(7) To be able to answer qualitative conceptual questions that require no calculation. These 
will be concept questions similar to those in lecture, where you will be asked to make a 
choice out of a multiple set of choices.  
 
(8) An understanding of circuit theory: analyze multi-loop circuits involving only batteries 
and resistors.   

 
 

To  study  for  this  exam  we  suggest  that  you  review  your  problem  sets,  in-class 
problems, Friday problem solving sessions, PRS in-class questions, and relevant 
parts of the study guide and class notes.
