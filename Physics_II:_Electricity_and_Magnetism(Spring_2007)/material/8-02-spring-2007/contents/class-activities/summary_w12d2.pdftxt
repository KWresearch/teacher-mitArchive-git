Topic Introduction 

In today’s class we will investigate the behavior of LRC circuits that we introduced in 
Monday’s class in an extended experiment.  First you will study undriven circuits, which 
behave like a mass on a spring which is pulled and then released.  Then you will look at the 
behavior of driven circuits that exhibit resonance.

Driven LRC Circuits 
We  can  also  add  a  force  to  our  circuits  –  the  AC  power  supply.    In  this 
case  the  current  responds  at  the  drive  frequency.  However,  depending  on 
the  frequency of  the drive,  the current may be out of phase  (either  leading 
or  lagging  the  drive)  and  its  amplitude will  also  vary.    This  is  easily  seen 
ω0 
in mechanical  systems.    For  a  fantastic  example,  play  with  the  pendula  at 
ω 
the Kendall T  station.  Depending  on how  fast  you  drive  them  they will  respond  either  in  or 
out  of  phase  with  your  drive,  and  they  will  either move  a  little  or  a  lot.   When  you  drive  at 
the natural frequency, the amplitude increases greatly, and the system is “in resonance.” 

One Element at a Time 
In order driven LRC circuits  its easiest  to start  thinking about  individual circuit elements.   A 
resistor obeys Ohm’s law:  V=IR.  Neither the amplitude nor phase of the voltage depends on 
the frequency (the response voltage is always in phase with the current). 
A capacitor is different.  At low frequencies the capacitor “fills up,” but at high frequencies it 
begins  discharging  before  “filling  up.”    The  voltage  is  frequency  dependent  and  the  current 
leads the voltage (current flows before the charge/potential on the capacitor appears). 
An  inductor  is  the  opposite  –  it  hates  the  change  of  high  frequencies  and  thus  has  large 
voltages there – and the current lags – the inductor fights before current flows. 
When  put  together  in  LRC  circuits,  the  capacitor  “dominates”  at  low  frequencies,  the 
inductor  at  high  ones.  At  resonance  (ω=  1  L C )  the  frequency  is  such  that  these  two 
effects  balance  and  the  current  will  be  largest  in  the  circuit.    Also  at  this  frequency  the 
current is in phase with the driving voltage (the AC power supply).

Seeing it Mathematically – Phasors 
To do  this mathematically we will use phasor diagrams.   A phasor  is a 
0 LV
vector  whose  magnitude  is  the  amplitude  of  either  voltage  or  current 
and whose  angle  corresponds  to  its  phase.  Phasors  rotate CCW  about 
the origin with time as their phase evolves, and their current amplitude 
is their component along the y-axis, which oscillates as it should. 
0CV
Phasors allow us  to add voltages  that are not  in phase with each other. 
For  example,  the  phasor  diagram  above  illustrates  the  relationship  of 
voltages  in  a  series  LRC  circuit.  The  current  I  is  assigned  to  be  at  “0  phase”  (along  the  x-
axis).  The  phase  of  the  voltage  across  the  resistor  is  the  same.    The  voltage  across  the

inductor  L  leads  (is  ahead  of  I)  and  the  voltage  across  the  capacitor  C  lags  (is  behind  I).  If 
you add up (using vector arithmetic) the voltages across R, L & C (the red and dashed blue & 
green  lines  respectively)  you  arrive  at  the voltage  across  the power  supply.   This  then gives 
you  a  rapid  way  of  understanding  the  phase  between  the  drive  (the  power  supply)  and  the 
response (the current) – here labeled φ. 

Natural Frequency 
Last class we derived the natural frequency ω= 1  L C  at which an undriven, undamped 
circuit will ring.  This is also the frequency at which a driven circuit will be in resonance, that 
is, where is will exhibit the maximum current for a given drive voltage and where the current 
and drive voltage will be in phase. 

Reactance & Impedance 
The reactance X is the proportionality constant relating voltage across a circuit element and 
current through it (V0 = I0  X).  The difference between resistance and reactance is that the 
current through and voltage across a resistance are always in phase, while for a reactance 
they are always 90º out of phase.  The generic term, impedance (Z), is used when the current 
and voltage have an arbitrary phase relationship. 

The reactance of a capacitor is X C  = 1 ωC .  If you drive current at a low frequency the 
capacitor will fill up and have a large voltage across it, whereas if you drive current a high 
frequency the capacitor will begin discharging before it has a chance to completely charge, 
and hence it won’t build up as large a voltage.  The current leads the voltage by 90º, as is 
most clearly seen in an uncharged capacitor where the current must flow before the 
charge/potential on the capacitor can build up. 

The reactance of an inductor is X L  =ωL .  It has a larger voltage when the current frequency 
is high, because it doesn’t like change and high frequency means lots of change.  Now the 
current lags the voltage by 90º – if you try to drive a current through an inductor with no 
current in it, the inductor will immediately put up a fight (create an EMF) and then later 
allow current to flow.

Using phasors, we added the voltages across a resistor, inductor and capacitor in series and 
found the impedance and phase of the circuit is given by:

=  R + (ωL − 1 ωC )2  and  tan ϕ=  X

R = (ωL − 1 ωC R 
) 

As you can see from the phase relationship (or by simply thinking about the circuit), at low 
frequencies the capacitor will “dominate” (it fills up, limiting the current) whereas at high 
frequencies the inductor will dominate (it fights the rapid changes).  At resonance 
(ω=  1  L C ) these two effects balance, the impedance is a minimum and the phase is zero 
(current is in phase with the driving voltage of the AC power supply).

The amplitude of the current for a given drive thus varies as a 
function of frequency, resulting in a frequency response curve 
similar to that pictured at left.  Mathematically,

NOTE:  Although I place these equations here they are not as fundamental as the impedance 
of R, L & C individually.  Those resistance/reactances always hold, while this impedance and 
phase are only valid in series RLC circuits.  Furthermore, these equations are readily 
derivable, and you should definitely know how to do so. 

Experiment 7:  Undriven and Driven LRC Circuits Part Two: 
driven RLC Circuits 

Preparation:  Read pre-lab and answer pre-lab questions. 

This lab consists of two main parts.  You did the first part last class involving an undriven 
LRC circuit and determined its natural frequency.  In the second part you will drive the same 
circuit around that natural frequency to confirm that it is the resonance frequency (or at least 
close to it) and to determine the properties of the circuit both on and off resonance.
