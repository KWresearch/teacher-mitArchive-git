An uncharged capacitor is connected to a 
dc voltage source via a switch. A resistor 
is placed in series with the capacitor. The 
switch is initially open. At t = 0, the 
switch is closed. A very long time after 
the switch is closed, the current in the 
circuit is  
1. nearly zero 
2. at a maximum and decreasing 
3. nearly constant but non-zero

An uncharged capacitor is connected to a 
dc voltage source via a switch. A resistor 
is placed in series with the capacitor. The 
switch is initially open. At t = 0, the 
switch is closed. Just after the switch is 
closed, the current in the circuit is  
 
1. zero and increasing 
2. at a maximum and decreasing 
3. constant but non-zero 

 

 
 
 
MULTILOOP CIRCUIT WITH CAPACITOR 
An uncharged capacitor 
is connected to a dc 
voltage source   in the

switch is initially open. 
At t = 0, the switch is 
closed. A long time
