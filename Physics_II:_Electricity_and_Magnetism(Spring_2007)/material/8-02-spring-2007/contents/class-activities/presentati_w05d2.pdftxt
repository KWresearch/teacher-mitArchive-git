General Exam Suggestions
• You should be able to complete every problem
• If you are confused, ask
• If it seems too hard, think some more
• Look for hints in other problems
• If you are doing math, you’re doing too much
• Read directions completely (before & after)
• Write down what you know before starting
• Draw pictures, define (label) variables
• Make sure that unknowns drop out of solution
• Don’t forget units!

Fields

Grass Seeds
Know how to read

Field Lines
Know how to draw

• Field line density tells you field strength
• Lines have tension (want to be straight)
• Lines are repulsive (want to be far from other lines)
• Lines begin and end on sources (charges) or ∞

Q:  Find E from V
The graph shows the variation of an electric 
potential V with distance z . The potential V 
does not depend on x or y. The potential V 
in the region -1 m < z < 1 m is given in Volts 
by the expression V(z)= 15 - 5z2. Outside of 
this region, the electric potential varies 
linearly with z, as indicated in the graph.

(a) Find an equation for the z-component of the electric field, Ez, in 
the region -1 m < z < 1 m.
(b) What is Ez in the region z > 1 m? Be careful to indicate the sign 
(c) What is Ez in the region z < -1 m? Be careful to indicate the sign 
(d) This potential is due a slab of charge with constant charge per unit 
volume ρo. Where is this slab of charge located (give the z-
coordinates that bound the slab)? What is the charge density ρo of 
the slab in C/m3? Be sure to give clearly both the sign and 
magnitude of ρo.

Q:  Parallel Plate Capacitor
A parallel plate capacitor consists of two conducting 
plates of area A, separated by a distance d, with 
charge +Q placed on the upper plate and –Q on the 
lower plate. The z-axis is defined as pictured.
a) What is the direction and magnitude of the 
electric field E in each of the following regions of 
space:  above & below the plates, in the plates and 
in between the plates.
b) What is the electric potential V(z) in these same five regions. Take the 
electric potential to be zero at z=0 (the lower surface of the top plate).
c) What is the electric potential difference between the upper and lower 
plate, ∆V=V(0) - V(d)?
d) What is the capacitance of this capacitor?
e) If this capacitor is now submerged into a vat of liquid dielectric (of 
dielectric constant κ), what now is the potential V(z) everywhere?
