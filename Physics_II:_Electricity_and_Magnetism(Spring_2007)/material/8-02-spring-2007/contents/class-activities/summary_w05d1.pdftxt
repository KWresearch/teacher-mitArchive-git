Topic Introduction 

 

 
In  today's  class  we  will  review  electromotive  force,  resistance,  and  capacitance,  and 
discuss  how  to  analyze  simple  DC  (constant  current)  circuits  using  Kirchhoff’s  Circuit 
Rules.  
 
Electromotive Force 
A  source  of  electric  energy  is  referred  to  as  an  electromotive  force,  or  emf  (symbolε). 
Batteries  are  an  example  of  an  emf  source.    They  can  be  thought  of  as  a  “charge  pump” 
that  moves  charges  from  lower  potential  to  the  higher  one,  opposite  the  direction  they 
would  normally  flow.    In  doing  this,  the  emf  creates  electric  energy  (typically  from 
chemical energy), which then flows to other parts of the circuit.  The emf ε is defined as 
the work  done  to move  a  unit  charge  in  the  direction  of  higher  potential. The  SI  unit  for 
ε is the volt (V), i.e. Joules/coulomb.   
 
Capacitance 

Next  we  will  discuss  what  happens  when 
multiple  capacitors  are  put  together.    There 
are  two  distinct  ways  of  putting  circuit 
elements  (such  as  capacitors)  together:  in 
series  and  in  parallel.    Elements  in  series 
(such  as  the  capacitors  and  battery  at  left) 
are connected one after another.   As shown, 
the  charge  on  each  capacitor  must  be  the 
same,  as  long  as  everything  is  initially 
uncharged  when 
the 
capacitors 
are 
connected  (which  is  always  the  case  unless 
otherwise  stated).    In  parallel,  the  capacitors  have  the  same  potential  drop  across  them 
(their  bottoms  and  tops  are  at  the  same  potential).    From  these  setups  we  will  calculate 
the  equivalent  capacitance  of  the  system  –  what  one  capacitor  could  replace  the  two 
capacitors  and  store  the  same  amount  of  charge  when  hooked  to  the  same  battery.    It 
turns  out  that  in  parallel  capacitors  add  (
)  while  in  series  they  add

Kirchhoff’s Circuit Rules  
In analyzing circuits, there are two fundamental (Kirchhoff’s) rules:  (1) The junction rule 
states  that  at  any  point  where  there  is  a  junction  between  various  current  carrying 
branches,  the  sum of  the currents  into  the node must equal  the sum of  the currents out of 
the  node  (otherwise  charge would  build  up  at  the  junction);  (2)  The  loop  rule  states  that 
V
the  sum  of  the  voltage  drops  ∆   across  all  circuit  elements  that  form  a  closed  loop  is 
zero (this is the same as saying the electrostatic field is conservative).

If you travel through a battery from the negative to the positive terminal, the voltage drop 
V∆

  is  +
V∆
otherwise 
 is -

of current, the voltage drop is –IR, because you are moving parallel to the electric field in

Steps for Solving Multi-loop DC Circuits 
1)  Draw a circuit diagram, and label all the quantities;  
2)  Assign a direction to the current in each branch of the circuit--if the actual direction is 
opposite to what you have assumed, your result at the end will be a negative number;  
3)   Apply the junction rule to the junctions;  
4)   Apply the loop rule to the loops until the number of independent equations obtained is 
the same as the number of unknowns.
