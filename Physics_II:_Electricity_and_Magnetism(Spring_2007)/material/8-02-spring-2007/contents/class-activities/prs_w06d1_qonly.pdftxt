Hall Effect 
 
A conducting slab has current to the 
right.  A B field is applied out of the 
page.  Due to magnetic forces on the 
charge carriers, the bottom of the slab is 
at a higher electric potential than the top 
of the slab.

V > V(Top) 

 

On the basis of this experiment, the sign 
of the charge carriers that make up the 
current in the slab is: 
1)  positive 
2)  negative 
3)  cannot be determined
