The plot shows the driving voltage V 
(black curve) and the current I (red 
curve) in a driven RLC circuit.   In 
this circuit,  
 

1.  The current leads the voltage 
 
2.  The current lags the voltage 
 
3.  Don’t have a clue 

 

 

  

 

PRS26 

 
 
The graph shows the current versus 
the voltage in a driven RLC circuit at 
a given driving frequency. In this plot 
1. The current leads the voltage by 
about 45 degrees. 
2. The current lags the voltage by 
about 45 degrees 
3. The current and the voltage are in 
phase 
4. Don’t have a clue.

The graph shows the current versus 
the voltage in a driven RLC circuit at 
a given driving frequency. In this plot 
1. Current lags voltage by ~90º 
2. Current leads voltage by ~90º 
3. Current and voltage are almost in 
phase 
4. We don’t have enough information 
to say whether the current leads or 
lags (but they aren’t in phase!) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

PRS26 

 

 
The graph shows the current versus 
the voltage in a driven RLC circuit at 
a particular driving frequency. At this 
frequency, the circuit is dominated by 
its 
1. Resistance 
2. Inductance 
3. Capacitance 
4. Don’t have a clue 

 

 
 

 

PRS26 

 

 
The graph shows the current versus 
the voltage in a driven RLC circuit at 
a particular driving frequency. Is this 
frequency above or below the 
resonance frequency of the circuit? 
 

1. Above the resonance frequency 
2. Below the resonance frequency 
3. Don’t have a clue
