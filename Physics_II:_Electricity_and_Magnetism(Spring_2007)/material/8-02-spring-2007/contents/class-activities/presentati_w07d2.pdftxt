Right Hand Rules 

1.  Torque:  Thumb = torque, fingers show rotation 
2.  Feel:  Thumb = I, Fingers = B, Palm = F 
3.  Create:  Thumb = I, Fingers (curl) = B 
4.  Moment:  Fingers (curl) = I, Thumb = Moment

First a BRIEF intro to 
magnetic materials

Para/Ferromagnetism 

Applied external field B0  tends to align the 
atomic magnetic moments (unpaired 
electrons)

Diamagnetism 
Everything is slightly 
diamagnetic.  Why? 
More later. 

If no magnetic 
moments (unpaired 
electrons) then this 
effect dominates.

1)  Create a strong field       
(with a field gradient!) 
2)  Looks like a dipole field 
3)  Toss in a frog (diamagnet) 
4)  Looks like a bar magnet 
pointing opposite the field 
5)  Seeks lower  field (force up) 
which balances gravity 
Most importantly, its stable: 
Restoring force always towards the center

these surfaces is the same and depends only

Always True, 
Occasionally Useful 
Like Gauss’s Law, 
Ampere’s Law is always true 
However, it is only useful for 
calculation in certain specific 
situations, involving highly 
symmetric currents. 
Here are examples…

Applying Ampere’s Law 
In Choosing Amperian Loop: 
•  Study & Follow Symmetry 
•  Determine Field Directions First 
•  Think About Where Field is Zero 
•  Loop Must 
•  Be Parallel to (Constant) Desired Field 
•  Be Perpendicular to Unknown Fields 
•  Or Be Located in Zero Field
