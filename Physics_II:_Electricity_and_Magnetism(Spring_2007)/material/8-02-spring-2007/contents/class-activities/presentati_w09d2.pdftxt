Eddy Current Braking
The magnet induces currents in the metal that 
dissipate the energy through Joule heating:
ω 1. Current is induced 
counter-clockwise (out 
from center)
2. Force is opposing motion 
(creates slowing torque)

Mutual Inductance
A current I2 in coil 2, induces some 
magnetic flux Φ12 in coil 1.  We 
define the flux in terms of a “mutual

Transmission of Electric Power

Power loss can be greatly reduced if 
transmitted at high voltage

P21-

Example: Transmission lines
An average of 120 kW of electric power is sent from 
a power plant. The transmission lines have a total 
resistance of 0.40 Ω. Calculate the power loss if the 
power is sent at (a) 240 V, and (b) 24,000 V.

atomic magnetic moments

Para/Ferromagnetism

Paramagnet:  Turn off B0, everything disorders
Ferromagnet: Turn off B0, remains (partially) ordered

This is why some items you can pick up with a 
magnet even though they don’t pick up other items
