Consider the above circular capacitor, and 
the Amperian loop (radius r) in the plane 
midway between the plates. When the 
capacitor is charging, the line integral of the 
magnetic field around the Amperian loop is   
1. Zero: No current crosses the surface spanning 
the Amperian loop 
2. Zero: The magnetic field is perpendicular to the 
Amperian Loop 
3. Non-zero: An electric current flows between 
the capacitor plates 
4. Non-zero: There is time changing electric flux 
on the surface spanning the Amperian Loop

The plot above shows a side and a top view of 
a capacitor with charge Q with electric and 
magnetic fields E and B at time t.  The 
charge Q is: 
1.   Increasing in time 
2.   Constant in time. 
3.   Decreasing in time.   
4.   Don’t have a clue.
