12.1  AC Sources 
 
In  Chapter  10  we  learned  that  changing  magnetic  flux  can  induce  an  emf  according  to 
Faraday’s  law  of  induction.  In  particular,  if  a  coil  rotates  in  the  presence  of  a  magnetic 
field,  the  induced  emf  varies  sinusoidally  with  time  and  leads  to  an  alternating  current 
(AC), and provides a source of AC power. The symbol for an AC voltage source is  
 

 

 
An example of an AC source is 
 
 
 
where  the  maximum  value V  is  called  the  amplitude.  The  voltage  varies  between 
0V
and 
0
0V−
 since  a  sine  function  varies  between +1  and −1. A  graph  of  voltage  as  a  function  of 
time is shown in Figure 12.1.1.

Figure 12.1.1 Sinusoidal voltage source 

 
The  sine  function  is  periodic  in  time.   This means  that  the  value  of  the  voltage  at  time  t  
will  be  exactly  the  same  at  a  later  time  t
t T
′ = +  where  T  is  the  period.   The  frequency, 
, has  the unit of  inverse  seconds  (s−1), or hertz  (Hz). The  angular 
f ,  defined  as 
f
T
1 /
=
. 
frequency is defined to be 
2 fω π=
 
When a voltage  source  is connected  to an RLC circuit, energy  is provided  to compensate 
the  energy  dissipation  in  the  resistor,  and  the  oscillation  will  no  longer  damp  out.  The 
oscillations  of  charge,  current  and  potential  difference  are  called  driven  or  forced 
oscillations.   
 
After an initial “transient time,” an AC current will flow in the circuit as a response to the 
driving voltage source. The current, written as

will  oscillate  with  the  same  frequency  as  the  voltage  source,  with  an  amplitude  0I  and 
phase φ that depends on the driving frequency. 
 
 
12.2  Simple AC circuits 
 
Before examining  the driven RLC circuit,  let’s  first consider  the simple cases where only 
one  circuit  element  (a  resistor,  an  inductor  or  a  capacitor)  is  connected  to  a  sinusoidal 
voltage source. 
 
12.2.1  Purely Resistive load 
 
Consider a purely resistive circuit with a resistor connected to an AC generator, as shown 
in  Figure  12.2.1.  (As  we  shall  see,  a  purely  resistive  circuit  corresponds  to  infinite 
capacitance  C
0L = .)

The behavior of

can also be  represented with a phasor diagram, as  shown 
( )
in Figure 12.2.2(b). A phasor is a rotating vector having the following properties: 
 
(i) length: the length corresponds to the amplitude. 
 
(ii) angular speed: the vector rotates counterclockwise with an angular speed ω.   
 
(iii)  projection:  the  projection  of  the  vector  along  the  vertical  axis  corresponds  to  the 
value of the alternating quantity at time t. 
 
(cid:71)

We  shall  denote  a  phasor  with  an  arrow  above  it.  The  phasor 
 has  a  constant

tω , which  is  equal 
0 s in
magnitude  of 
.  Its  projection  along  the  vertical  direction  is 
,  the  voltage  drop  across  the  resistor  at  time  t .  A  similar  interpretation  applies 
RV t
to 
( )
(cid:71)
0RI
 for  the  current  passing  through  the  resistor.  From  the  phasor  diagram,  we  readily 
to
see that both the current and the voltage are in phase with each other. 
 
The average value of current over one period can be obtained as: 
 
 
 
This average vanishes because 
 
 
 
Similarly, one may find the following relations useful when averaging over one period:

which leads to the same expression for I0 as that obtained in Eq. (12.3.7).

It is crucial to note that the maximum amplitude of the AC voltage source 
 is not equal 
to the sum of the maximum voltage amplitudes across the three circuit elements:  
 
 
 
This is due to the fact that the voltages are not in phase with one another, and they reach 
their maxima at different times.  
 
 
12.3.1  Impedance  
 
Lω=

We  have  already  seen  that  the  inductive  reactance 
and  capacitance  reactance 
CX
Cω=
1 /
play  the  role  of  an  effective  resistance  in  the  purely  inductive  and  capacitive 
circuits,  respectively.  In  the  series RLC  circuit,  the  effective  resistance  is  the  impedance, 
defined as  
 
 
 
The  relationship  between  Z,  XL  and  XC  can  be  represented  by  the  diagram  shown  in

The impedance also has SI units of ohms. In terms of Z, the current may be rewritten as  
 
 
 
Notice that the impedance Z also depends on the angular frequency ω, as do XL and XC.  
 
Using  Eq.  (12.3.6)  for  the  phase φ and  Eq.  (12.3.15)  for  Z , we may  readily  recover  the 
limits  for  simple  circuit  (with  only  one  element).  A  summary  is  provided  in  Table  12.1

illustrated in Figure 12.4.2. The width  ω∆  increases with resistance R.

12.5  Transformer 
 
A  transformer  is  a  device  used  to  increase  or  decrease  the  AC  voltage  in  a  circuit.  A 
typical device consists of  two coils of wire, a primary and a secondary, wound around an 
1N
iron core, as  illustrated  in Figure 12.5.1. The primary coil, with 
 turns,  is connected  to 
.  The  secondary  coil  has  N
1 ( )V t
2  turns  and  is  connected  to  a 
alternating  voltage  source 
“load  resistance” 2R .  The  way  transformers  operate  is  based  on  the  principle  that  an

alternating  current  in  the  primary  coil  will  induce  an  alternating  emf  on  the  secondary 
coil due to their mutual inductance. 
 

 
Figure 12.5.1 A transformer 

 

 
 
In  the  primary  circuit,  neglecting  the  small  resistance  in  the  coil,  Faraday’s  law  of 
induction implies 
 
 
 
where 
 is the magnetic flux through one turn of the primary coil. The iron core, which 
BΦ
extends  from  the  primary  to  the  secondary  coils,  serves  to  increase  the  magnetic  field 
produced  by  the  current  in  the  primary  coil  and  ensure  that  nearly  all  the  magnetic  flux 
through  the  primary  coil  also  passes  through  each  turn  of  the  secondary  coil.  Thus,  the 
voltage (or induced emf) across the secondary coil is

In  the  case  of  an  ideal  transformer,  power  loss  due  to  Joule  heating  can  be  ignored,  so 
that the power supplied by the primary coil is completely transferred to the secondary coil: 
 
 
 
In addition, no magnetic  flux  leaks out  from  the  iron core, and  the  flux 
 through each 
BΦ
turn  is  the  same  in  both  the  primary  and  the  secondary  coils.  Combining  the  two 
expressions, we are lead to the transformer equation:

By  combining  the  two  equations  above,  the  transformation  of  currents  in  the  two  coils 
may be obtained as:

R,  L,  and  C  are  the  same,  and  each  voltage  is  in  phase  with  the  current  through  the 
resistor. However, the currents through each element will be different.

12.8  Problem-Solving Tips 
 
In  this  chapter, we  have  seen  how  phasors  provide  a  powerful  tool  for  analyzing  the AC 
circuits.  Below are some important tips: 
 
1. Keep in mind the phase relationships for simple circuits 
 
 
 
 
 
2. When circuit elements are connected in series, the instantaneous current is the same for 
all  elements,  and  the  instantaneous  voltages  across  the  elements  are  out  of  phase.  On 
the  other  hand,  when  circuit  elements  are  connected  in  parallel,  the  instantaneous 
voltage is the same for all elements, and the instantaneous currents across the elements 
are out of phase.  

(1) For a resistor, the voltage and the phase are always in phase. 
90°
. 
(2) For an inductor, the current lags the voltage by
90°
. 
(3) For a capacitor, the current leads to voltage by 

 
3.  For  series  connection,  draw  a  phasor  diagram  for  the  voltages.  The  amplitudes  of  the 
voltage  drop  across  all  the  circuit  elements  involved  should  be  represented  with 
phasors. In Figure 12.8.1 the phasor diagram for a series RLC circuit is shown for both
