8.1  Introduction 
 
(cid:71)
We have seen that a charged object produces an electric field  E
at all points in space. In a 
(cid:71)
similar  manner,  a  bar  magnet  is  a  source  of  a  magnetic  field  B
.  This  can  be  readily 
demonstrated  by  moving  a  compass  near  the  magnet.  The  compass  needle  will  line  up 
along  the  direction  of  the  magnetic  field  produced  by  the  magnet,  as  depicted  in  Figure 
8.1.1. 
 

 

Figure 8.1.1 Magnetic field produced by a bar magnet 

 
Notice  that  the  bar  magnet  consists  of  two  poles,  which  are  designated  as  the  north  (N) 
and  the  south  (S).  Magnetic  fields  are  strongest  at  the  poles.  The  magnetic  field  lines 
leave  from  the  north  pole  and  enter  the  south  pole. When  holding  two  bar magnets  close 
to  each other,  the  like poles will  repel  each other while  the opposite poles  attract  (Figure 
8.1.2).  
 

 

 

 

Figure 8.1.2 Magnets attracting and repelling 

 
Unlike  electric  charges which  can  be  isolated,  the  two magnetic  poles  always  come  in  a 
pair.  When  you  break  the  bar  magnet,  two  new  bar  magnets  are  obtained,  each  with  a 
north pole and a  south pole  (Figure 8.1.3).  In other words, magnetic “monopoles” do not 
exist in isolation, although they are of theoretical interest.

8.2  The Definition of a Magnetic Field 
 
To  define  the  magnetic  field  at  a  point,  consider  a  particle  of  charge  q  and  moving  at  a 
v(cid:71)
velocity . Experimentally we have the following observations: 
 
(cid:71)
(1) The magnitude of the magnetic force  BF
to both v and q.  

exerted on the charged particle is proportional

(cid:71)

 is proportional to

(4) When  the  sign  of  the  charge  of  the  particle  is  switched  from  positive  to  negative  (or 
vice versa), the direction of the magnetic force also reverses.

8.3  Magnetic Force on a Current-Carrying Wire 
 
We have  just  seen  that a  charged particle moving  through a magnetic  field experiences a 
(cid:71)
BF
magnetic  force 
.  Since  electric  current  consists  of  a  collection  of  charged  particles  in 
motion,  when  placed  in  a  magnetic  field,  a  current-carrying  wire  will  also  experience  a 
magnetic force.  
 
Consider  a  long  straight  wire  suspended  in  the  region  between  the  two  magnetic  poles. 
The magnetic  field  points  out  the  page  and  is  represented with  dots  (•).  It  can  be  readily 
demonstrated  that  when  a  downward  current  passes  through,  the  wire  is  deflected  to  the 
left. However, when the current is upward, the deflection is rightward, as shown in Figure 
8.3.1.   
 

, however, can be altered by the magnetic force, as we shall see below.

To  calculate  the  force  exerted  on  the  wire,  consider  a  segment  of  wire  of  length  (cid:65)  and 
cross-sectional area A, as  shown  in Figure 8.3.2. The magnetic  field points  into  the page, 
and is represented with crosses ( X ).

For  a  wire  of  arbitrary  shape,  the  magnetic  force  can  be  obtained  by  summing  over  the 
forces acting on the small segments that make up the wire. Let the differential segment be

8.4.1  Magnetic force on a dipole  
 
As  we  have  shown  above,  the  force  experienced  by  a  current-carrying  rectangular  loop 
(i.e.,  a magnetic  dipole)  placed  in  a  uniform magnetic  field  is  zero. What  happens  if  the 
magnetic field is non-uniform? In this case, there will be a net force acting on the dipole.  
 
Consider the situation where a small dipole  µ(cid:71)  is placed along the symmetric axis of a bar 
magnet, as shown in Figure 8.4.4.

The dipole experiences an attractive force by the bar magnet whose magnetic field is non-

Animation 8.1: Torques on a Dipole in a Constant Magnetic Field 
 

“…To  understand  this  point, we  have  to  consider  that  a  [compass]  needle 
vibrates  by  gathering  upon  itself,  because  of  it  magnetic  condition  and 
polarity,  a  certain  amount  of  the  lines  of  force,  which  would  otherwise 
traverse the space about it…”   

Michael Faraday [1855] 

 
Consider  a  magnetic  dipole  in  a  constant  background  field.    Historically,  we  note  that 
Faraday  understood  the  oscillations  of  a  compass  needle  in  exactly  the way we  describe 
here.    We  show  in  Figure  8.4.5  a  magnetic  dipole  in  a  “dip  needle”  oscillating  in  the 
magnetic  field  of  the  Earth,  at  a  latitude  approximately  the  same  as  that  of Boston.    The 
magnetic  field of  the Earth  is  predominantly downward  and northward  at  these Northern 
latitudes, as the visualization indicates.  
 

 

 
Figure  8.4.5  A  magnetic  dipole  in  the  form  of  a  dip  needle  oscillates  in  the  magnetic 
field of the Earth. 
 
To explain what is going on in this visualization, suppose that the magnetic dipole vector 
is  initially  along  the  direction  of  the  earth’s  field  and  rotating  clockwise.    As  the  dipole 
rotates, the magnetic field lines are compressed and stretched. The tensions and pressures 
associated  with  this  field  line  stretching  and  compression  results  in  an  electromagnetic 
torque on the dipole that slows its clockwise rotation.  Eventually the dipole comes to rest.  
But  the  counterclockwise  torque  still  exists,  and  the  dipole  then  starts  to  rotate 
counterclockwise,  passing  back  through  being  parallel  to  the  Earth’s  field  again  (where 
the torque goes to zero), and overshooting.   
 
As  the  dipole  continues  to  rotate  counterclockwise,  the  magnetic  field  lines  are  now 
compressed and stretched in the opposite sense.  The electromagnetic torque has reversed 
sign,  now  slowing  the  dipole  in  its  counterclockwise  rotation.  Eventually  the  dipole will 
come  to  rest,  start  rotating  clockwise  once more,  and  pass back  through being parallel  to 

 

11

the field, as in the beginning.  If there is no damping in the system, this motion continues 
indefinitely.   
 

 

 
Figure  8.4.6  A  magnetic  dipole  in  the  form  of  a  dip  needle  rotates  oscillates  in  the 
magnetic  field  of  the  Earth.   We  show  the  currents  that  produce  the  earth’s  field  in  this 
visualization.   
 
What about  the conservation of angular momentum  in  this situation?   Figure 8.4.6 shows 
a global picture of  the  field  lines of  the dip needle and  the  field  lines of  the Earth, which 
are  generated  deep  in  the  core  of  the  Earth.    If  you  examine  the  stresses  transmitted 
between the Earth and the dip needle in this visualization, you can convince yourself that 
any  clockwise  torque  on  the  dip  needle  is  accompanied  by  a  counterclockwise  torque  on 
the  currents  producing  the  earth’s  magnetic  field.    Angular  momentum  is  conserved  by 
the exchange of equal and opposite amounts of angular momentum between  the compass 
and the currents in the Earth’s core.    
 
 
8.5  Charged Particles in a Uniform Magnetic Field

particle  is  a  radial  force  of  magnitude 
that  always  points  toward  the  center

will  play  the  role  of  a  centripetal

as shown in Figure 8.5.1.

Animation 8.2: Charged Particle Moving in a Uniform Magnetic Field 
 
Figure  8.5.3  shows  a  charge  moving  toward  a  region  where  the  magnetic  field  is 
vertically upward. When the charge enters the region where the external magnetic field is 
non-zero,  it  is  deflected  in  a  direction  perpendicular  to  that  field  and  to  its  velocity  as  it 
enters  the  field.    This  causes  the  charge  to  move  in  an  arc  that  is  a  segment  of  a  circle, 
until the charge exits the region where the external magnetic field in non-zero.   We show 
in  the  animation  the  total magnetic  field which  is  the  sum  of  the  external magnetic  field 
and the magnetic field of the moving charge (to be shown in Chapter 9):

The bulging of that field on the side opposite the direction in which the particle is pushed 
is due  to  the buildup  in magnetic pressure on  that side.     It  is  this pressure  that causes  the 
charge to move in a circle.

Figure  8.5.3 A  charged  particle moves  in  a magnetic  field  that  is  non-zero  over  the  pie- 
shaped region shown. The external field is upward.   
 
Finally, consider momentum conservation. The moving charge in the animation of Figure 
8.5.3  changes  its direction of motion by ninety degrees over  the  course of  the  animation. 
How  do  we  conserve  momentum  in  this  process?    Momentum  is  conserved  because 
momentum  is  transmitted  by  the  field  from  the  moving  charge  to  the  currents  that  are 
generating  the  constant  external  field.      This  is  plausible  given  the  field  configuration 
shown  in  Figure  8.5.3.  The  magnetic  field  stress,  which  pushes  the  moving  charge 
sideways, is accompanied by a tension pulling the current source in the opposite direction.  
To see this, look closely at the field stresses where the external field lines enter the region 
where  the  currents  that  produce  them  are  hidden,  and  remember  that  the  magnetic  field 
acts  as  if  it were  exerting  a  tension  parallel  to  itself. The momentum  loss  by  the moving 
charge is transmitted to the hidden currents producing the constant field in this manner.   
 
 
8.6  Applications 
 
There  are  many  applications  involving  charged  particles  moving  through  a  uniform 
magnetic field.

If  the  electrons  further  pass  through  a  region  where  there  exists  a  downward  uniform

the  use  of  a  mass  spectrometer.  The  basic  feature  of  a  Bainbridge  mass  spectrometer  is

,  are 
V∆ ,  and  subsequently  deflected  by  a 
accelerated  from  rest  by  a  potential  difference 
uniform magnetic  field  into  semicircular paths. The  radii of  the  trajectories by particle A 
and B  are R  and  2R,  respectively. The  direction  of  the magnetic  field  is  perpendicular  to 
the velocity of the particle. What is their mass ratio? 
 
Solution: 
 
The kinetic energy gained by the charges is equal to

8.9.4  Bar Magnet in Non-Uniform Magnetic Field  
 
A bar magnet with its north pole up is placed along the symmetric axis below a horizontal 
conducting  ring  carrying  current  I,  as  shown  in  the  Figure  8.9.3.  At  the  location  of  the 
ring, the magnetic field makes an angle θ with the vertical. What is the force on the ring?

8.10  Conceptual Questions 
 
1.  Can  a  charged  particle  move  through  a  uniform  magnetic  field  without  experiencing 
any force? Explain. 
 
2. If no work can be done on a charged particle by the magnetic field, how can the motion 
of the particle be influenced by the presence of a field? 
 
3. Suppose a charged particle is moving under the influence of both electric and magnetic 
fields.  How can the effect of the two fields on the motion of the particle be distinguished? 
 
4.  What  type  of  magnetic  field  can  exert  a  force  on  a  magnetic  dipole?  Is  the  force 
repulsive or attractive? 
 
5. If a compass needle is placed in a uniform magnetic field, is there a net magnetic force 
acting on the needle? Is there a net torque?

8.11.2   Magnetic Force on a Current Carrying Wire 
 
=(cid:65)
0.1 m
A  square  loop  of  wire,  of  length 
on  each  side,  has  a  mass  of  50  g  and  pivots 
about  an  axis AA'  that  corresponds  to  a horizontal  side of  the  square,  as  shown  in Figure 
8.11.1.  A  magnetic  field  of  500  G,  directed  vertically  downward,  uniformly  fills  the 
region in the vicinity of the loop. The loop carries a current I so that it is in equilibrium at 
20θ=
° .

that flows in the loop to maintain the 
 angle. 
 
(b) Calculate the torque about the axis due to these forces. 
 
(c) Find  the  current  in  the  loop  by  requiring  the  sum  of  all  torques  (about  the  axis)  to  be 
zero.  (Hint:  Consider  the  effect  of  gravity  on  each  of  the  4  segments  of  the  wire 
separately.) [Ans. I ~ 20 A.]  
 
(d) Determine the magnitude and direction of the force exerted on the axis by the pivots.  
 
(e)  Repeat  part  (b)  by  now  using  the  definition  of  a  magnetic  dipole  to  calculate  the 
torque exerted on such a loop due to the presence of a magnetic field.

A  uniform  magnetic  field  is  applied  in  the  vertical  direction.  To  prevent  the  bar  from 
sliding  down,  a  voltage  source  is  connected  to  the  ends  of  the  bar  with  current  flowing 
through. Determine  the magnitude  and  the  direction  of  the  current  such  that  the  bar will
