3.1 Potential and Potential Energy  
 
In  the  introductory  mechanics  course,  we  have  seen  that  gravitational  force  from  the 
Earth  on  a  particle  of mass m  located  at  a  distance  r  from  Earth’s  center  has  an  inverse-
square form:

In  the  examples  above,  if  the  path  forms  a  closed  loop,  so  that  the  object moves  around 
and  then  returns  to where  it  starts off,  the net work done by  the gravitational  field would 
(cid:71)
be zero, and we say that the gravitational force is conservative. More generally, a force  F
 
is said to be conservative if its line integral around a closed loop vanishes:

When dealing with a conservative force, it is often convenient to introduce the concept of 
potential  energy  U.  The  change  in  potential  energy  associated  with  a  conservative  force 
(cid:74)(cid:71)
 acting on an object as it moves from A to B is defined as:

as  the  energy  an  electron  acquires  (or  loses) when moving  through  a potential difference 
of one volt:

Once  again,  the  potential  difference V∆  depends  only  on  the  endpoints,  independent  of 
the choice of path taken. 
 
As  in  the  case  of  gravity,  only  the  difference  in  electrical  potential  is  physically 
meaningful,  and  one may  choose  a  reference  point  and  set  the  potential  there  to  be  zero. 
In practice, it is often convenient to choose the reference point to be at infinity, so that the 
electric potential at a point P becomes 
 
 
 
With  this  reference,  the  electric  potential  at  a  distance  r  away  from  a  point  charge  Q

3.5.1 Gradient and Equipotentials 
  
Suppose  a  system  in  two  dimensions  has  an  electric  potential 
V x y .  The  curves 
( ,
)
are  called  equipotential  curves.  Examples  of 
characterized  by  constant

)
equipotential curves are depicted in Figure 3.5.1 below. 
 

. Using  the

In  three  dimensions  we  have  equipotential  surfaces  and  they  are  described  by

The properties of equipotential surfaces can be summarized as follows: 
 
(i)  The  electric  field  lines  are  perpendicular  to  the  equipotentials  and  point  from 
higher to lower potentials. 

 
(ii)  By symmetry, the equipotential surfaces produced by a point charge form a family 
of  concentric  spheres,  and  for  constant  electric  field,  a  family  of  planes 
perpendicular to the field lines. 

 
(iii)  The  tangential  component  of  the  electric  field  along  the  equipotential  surface  is 
zero,  otherwise  non-vanishing  work  would  be  done  to  move  a  charge  from  one 
point on the surface to the other. 

 
(iv)  No work is required to move a particle along an equipotential surface. 

 
A  useful  analogy  for  equipotential  curves  is  a  topographic  map  (Figure  3.5.4).  Each 
contour  line on  the map represents a fixed elevation above sea level. Mathematically  it  is 
expressed  as 
.  Since  the  gravitational  potential  near  the  surface  of

3.7 Problem-Solving Strategy: Calculating Electric Potential 
 
In  this  chapter, we  showed  how  electric  potential  can  be  calculated  for  both  the  discrete 
and  continuous  charge  distributions.  Unlike  electric  field,  electric  potential  is  a  scalar 
quantity. For  the discrete distribution, we apply  the superposition principle and sum over 
individual contributions: 
 
 

q
= ∑  
V k
i
e
r
i
i

 
For the continuous distribution, we must evaluate the integral 
 

V k
=

∫

e

dq
r

 

 
In  analogy  to  the  case  of  computing  the  electric  field,  we  use  the  following  steps  to 
complete the integration: 
 
(1) Start with 
 
(2) Rewrite the charge element dq as

depending on whether the charge is distributed over a length, an area, or a volume.  
 
(3) Substitute dq into the expression for
 
(4) Specify an appropriate coordinate  system and express  the differential element  (dl, dA 
or  dV  ) and r  in terms of the coordinates (see Table 2.1.)  
 
(5) Rewrite  dV  in terms of the integration variable. 
 
(6) Complete the integration to obtain V. 
 
(cid:71)
Using  the  result  obtained  for  V ,  one  may  calculate  the  electric  field  by 
= −∇E
V
.  
Furthermore,  the  accuracy  of  the  result  can  be  readily  checked  by  choosing  a  point  P 
which  lies  sufficiently  far  away  from  the  charge  distribution.  In  this  limit,  if  the  charge 
distribution  is  of  finite  extent,  the  field  should  behave  as  if  the  distribution were  a  point 
charge, and falls off as

3.10.7 Calculating Electric Field from the Electric Potential 
 
Suppose  that  the  electric  potential  varies  along  the  x-axis  as  shown  in  Figure  3.10.3 
below.   
 

Figure 3.10.3 

 
The  potential  does  not  vary  in  the  y-  or  z  -direction.   Of  the  intervals  shown  (ignore  the 
xE
behavior at the end points of the intervals), determine the intervals in which 
 has  
 
(a) its greatest absolute value. [Ans:  25 V/m in interval ab.] 
 
(b) its least.  [Ans: (b) 0 V/m in interval cd.] 
 
(c) Plot 
 
(d)  What  sort  of  charge  distributions  would  produce  these  kinds  of  changes  in  the 
potential?   Where  are  they  located?    [Ans:  sheets  of  charge  extending  in  the  yz  direction 
located  at  points  b,  c,  d,  etc.  along  the  x-axis.  Note  again  that  a  sheet  of  charge  with 
charge  per  unit  area  σ  will  always  produce  a  jump  in  the  normal  component  of  the 
electric field of magnitude

3.10.8 Electric Potential and Electric Potential Energy 
 
A  right  isosceles  triangle of  side a has charges q, +2q and −q arranged on  its vertices, as 
shown in Figure 3.10.4.

charges, assuming that V  = 0 at infinity?  [Ans: q/
and 
q−
 
(b)   What  is  the  potential  energy  U  of  this  configuration  of  three  charges?   What  is  the 
significance  of  the  sign  of  your  answer?  [Ans:  −q2/4 2 πεoa,  the  negative  sign  means 
that  work  was  done  on  the  agent  who  assembled  these  charges  in  moving  them  in  from 
infinity.] 
 
(c)   A  fourth  charge with  charge +3q  is  slowly moved  in  from  infinity  to  point P.   How 
much  work  must  be  done  in  this  process?    What  is  the  significance  of  the  sign  of  your 
answer?    [Ans:   +3q2/ 2 πεoa,  the positive  sign means  that work was done by  the agent 
who moved this charge in from infinity.] 
 
 
3.10.9. Electric Field, Potential and Energy  
 
Three  charges,  +5Q,  −5Q,  and  +3Q  are  located  on  the  y-axis  at  y  =  +4a,  y  =  0,  and 
, respectively.  The point P is on the x-axis at x = 3a.
