Topic Introduction 

Today we continue our discussion of electric potentials and equipotentials, becoming more 
familiar with them and their relationship with charge and electric fields through our first 
experiment.   

Equipotentials 
Recall from our last class that when discussing potential and potential energy we only 
defined differences.  This is because only differences are physically meaningful – what we 
choose, for example, to call “zero energy” is completely arbitrary.  Today we will focus on 
the measurement of equipotential surfaces, that is, locations where the potential is the same, 
and will practice estimating electric field lines and charge distributions once those 
equipotential surfaces are known. 

Experiment 1:  Equipotential Lines and Electric Fields 
Preparation:  Read pre-lab and answer pre-lab questions 

Thus far in class we have talked about fields, both gravitational and electric, and how we can 
use them to understand how objects can interact at a distance.  A charge, for example, creates 
an electric field around it, which can then exert a force on a second charge which enters that 
field.  In this lab we will study another way of thinking about this interaction through electric 
potentials. 

In particular, for several given charge configurations you will map out equipotential 
contours, that is, contours along which the potential is a constant.  From these equipotentials 
you can determine both the direction and magnitude of the electric field.
