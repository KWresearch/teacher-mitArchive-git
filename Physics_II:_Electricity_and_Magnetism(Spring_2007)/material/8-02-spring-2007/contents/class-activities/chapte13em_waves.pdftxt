13.1  The Displacement Current 
 
In  Chapter  9,  we  learned  that  if  a  current-carrying  wire  possesses  certain  symmetry,  the 
magnetic field can be obtained by using Ampere’s law:

The  equation  states  that  the  line  integral  of  a  magnetic  field  around  an  arbitrary  closed 
0 encIµ ,  where 
encI
loop  is  equal  to 
 is  the  conduction  current  passing  through  the  surface 
bound  by  the  closed  path.  In  addition,  we  also  learned  in  Chapter  10  that,  as  a 
consequence of the Faraday’s law of induction, a changing magnetic field can produce an 
electric field, according to

One  might  then  wonder  whether  or  not  the  converse  could  be  true,  namely,  a  changing 
electric field produces a magnetic field. If so, then the right-hand side of Eq. (13.1.1) will 
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
have to be modified to reflect such “symmetry” between  E
and  B
.  
 
To  see  how  magnetic  fields  can  be  created  by  a  time-varying  electric  field,  consider  a 
capacitor which  is being  charged. During  the  charging process,  the  electric  field  strength 
increases with  time  as more  charge  is  accumulated on  the plates. The  conduction  current 
that carries the charges also produces a magnetic field. In order to apply Ampere’s law to 
calculate this field, let us choose curve C shown in Figure 13.1.1 to be the Amperian loop.

If  the  surface  bounded  by  the  path  is  the  flat  surface 
,  then  the  enclosed  current 
I= .  On  the  other  hand,  if  we  choose 
encI
2S
 to  be  the  surface  bounded  by  the  curve, 
is
I
2S
since  no  current  passes  through 
then 
0
.    Thus,  we  see  that  there  exists  an 
=
enc
ambiguity in choosing the appropriate surface bounded by the curve C.  
 
Maxwell  showed  that  the  ambiguity  can  be  resolved  by  adding  to  the  right-hand  side  of 
the Ampere’s law an extra term  
 
 
which he called  the “displacement current.”   The  term  involves a change  in electric  flux. 
The generalized Ampere’s (or the Ampere-Maxwell) law now reads

where  A  is  the  area  of  the  capacitor  plates.  From  Eq.  (13.1.3),  we  readily  see  that  the

However, the right-hand-side of the expression,

the Ampere-Maxwell  law,  the ambiguity  in choosing  the  surface bound by  the Amperian 
loop is removed.  
 
 
13.2  Gauss’s Law for Magnetism 
 
We  have  seen  that  Gauss’s  law  for  electrostatics  states  that  the  electric  flux  through  a 
closed  surface  is  proportional  to  the  charge  enclosed  (Figure  13.2.1a).  The  electric  field 
lines  originate  from  the  positive  charge  (source)  and  terminate  at  the  negative  charge 
(sink). One would then be tempted to write down the magnetic equivalent as

despite  intense  search  effort,  no  isolated  magnetic  monopole  has  ever  been  observed.

Hence, 
and Gauss’s law for magnetism becomes

Figure 13.2.1 Gauss’s law for (a) electrostatics, and (b) magnetism. 

 
This  implies  that  the number of magnetic  field  lines  entering  a  closed  surface  is  equal  to 
the  number  of  field  lines  leaving  the  surface.  That  is,  there  is  no  source  or  sink.  In 
addition,  the  lines must be continuous with no starting or end points.  In fact, as shown  in 
Figure  13.2.1(b)  for  a  bar magnet,  the  field  lines  that  emanate  from  the  north  pole  to  the 
south pole outside the magnet return within the magnet and form a closed loop.

We now have four equations which form the foundation of electromagnetic phenomena:

Physical Interpretation 

Electric  flux  through  a  closed  surface 
is proportional to the charged enclosed 

Changing  magnetic  flux  produces  an 
electric field 

The  total  magnetic  flux  through  a 
closed surface is zero 

Electric  current  and  changing  electric 
flux produces a magnetic field 

 
Collectively  they  are  known  as  Maxwell’s  equations.  The  above  equations  may  also  be 
written in differential forms as  
 
 
 

 

(13.3.1)

(13.3.2) 

 
An  important  consequence  of  Maxwell’s  equations,  as  we  shall  see  below,  is  the 
prediction  of  the  existence  of  electromagnetic  waves  that  travel  with  speed  of  light 
c
1 /
.  The  reason  is  due  to  the  fact  that  a  changing  electric  field  produces  a 
µε
=
0 0
magnetic  field  and  vice  versa,  and  the  coupling  between  the  two  fields  leads  to  the 
generation of electromagnetic waves. The prediction was confirmed by H. Hertz in 1887.

13.4  Plane Electromagnetic Waves 
 
To  examine  the  properties  of  the  electromagnetic waves,  let’s  consider  for  simplicity  an 
(cid:71)
electromagnetic  wave  propagating  in  the  +x-direction,  with  the  electric  field  E
pointing 
(cid:71)
in the +z-direction, as shown in Figure 13.4.1 
in the +y-direction and the magnetic field  B
below. 
 

 

Figure 13.4.1 A plane electromagnetic wave 

 
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
What  we  have  here  is  an  example  of  a  plane  wave  since  at  any  instant  both E and B
are 
uniform  over  any  plane  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  propagation.  In  addition,  the 
wave  is  transverse  because  both  fields  are  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  propagation, 
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
which points in the direction of the cross product  ×E B
.  
 
Using  Maxwell’s  equations,  we  may  obtain  the  relationship  between  the  magnitudes  of 
the fields. To see this, consider a rectangular loop which lies in the xy plane, with the left 
x
x+ ∆ . The bottom side of the loop is located at  y , 
x
side of the loop at 
 and the right at 
y+ ∆ ,  as  shown  in  Figure  13.4.2.  Let  the  unit 
and  the  top  side  of  the  loop  is  located  at  y
ˆ
ˆ =n k . 
vector normal to the loop be in the positive z-direction,

The  result  indicates  that  a  time-varying  electric  field  is  generated  by  a  spatially  varying 
magnetic field.  
 
Using Eqs. (13.4.4) and (13.4.8), one may verify that both the electric and magnetic fields 
satisfy the one-dimensional wave equation. 
 
To show this, we first take another partial derivative of Eq. (13.4.5) with respect to x, and 
then another partial derivative of Eq. (13.4.9) with respect to t:

The  waves  described  by  Eqs.  (13.5.6)  and  (13.5.7)  are  standing  waves,  which  do  not 
propagate but simply oscillate in space and time. 
 
Let’s  first  examine  the  spatial  dependence  of  the  fields. Eq.  (13.5.6)  shows  that  the  total

the amplitude of the field is at its maximum 
. The planes that contain these points are 
the anti-nodal planes of  the electric field. Note  that  in between  two nodal planes, there is 
an anti-nodal plane, and vice versa.

for  the  magnetic  field.  Thus,  unlike  the  traveling  electromagnetic  wave  in  which  the 
electric  and  the magnetic  fields  are  always  in  phase,  in  standing  electromagnetic  waves, 
the two fields are  90  out of phase.

Standing  electromagnetic  waves  can  be  formed  by  confining  the  electromagnetic  waves 
within two perfectly reflecting conductors, as shown in Figure 13.4.6.

13.6  Poynting Vector 
 
In  Chapters  5  and  11  we  had  seen  that  electric  and  magnetic  fields  store  energy.  Thus, 
energy  can  also  be  carried  by  the  electromagnetic  waves  which  consist  of  both  fields. 
Consider a plane electromagnetic wave passing through a small volume element of area A 
dx
and thickness 
, as shown in Figure 13.6.1.

The result is to be expected since the standing wave does not propagate. Alternatively, we 
may  say  that  the  energy  carried  by  the  two  waves  traveling  in  the  opposite  directions  to 
form the standing wave exactly cancel each other, with no net energy transfer.

13.7  Momentum and Radiation Pressure 
 
The electromagnetic wave  transports not only energy but also momentum, and hence can 
exert  a  radiation  pressure  on  a  surface  due  to  the  absorption  and  reflection  of  the 
momentum.  Maxwell  showed  that  if  the  plane  electromagnetic  wave  is  completely 
absorbed by a surface, the momentum transferred is related to the energy absorbed by 
 
 
 
On  the other hand,  if  the  electromagnetic wave  is  completely  reflected by  a  surface  such 
as a mirror, the result becomes 
 
 
 
For  the  complete  absorption  case,  the  average  radiation  pressure  (force  per  unit  area)  is 
given by

13.8  Production of Electromagnetic Waves 
 
Electromagnetic  waves  are  produced  when  electric  charges  are  accelerated.  In  other 
words, a charge must  radiate energy when  it undergoes acceleration. Radiation cannot be 
produced by stationary charges or steady currents. Figure 13.8.1 depicts  the electric  field 
lines produced by an oscillating charge at some instant. 
 

 

 
Figure 13.8.1 Electric field lines of an oscillating point charge 

 
A  common  way  of  producing  electromagnetic  waves  is  to  apply  a  sinusoidal  voltage 
source  to an antenna, causing  the charges  to accumulate near  the  tips of  the antenna. The 
effect  is  to  produce  an  oscillating  electric  dipole.  The  production  of  electric-dipole 
radiation is depicted in Figure 13.8.2.  
 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 13.8.2 Electric fields produced by an electric-dipole antenna. 

 
0t =
At  time 
the  ends  of  the  rods  are  charged  so  that  the  upper  rod  has  a  maximum 
positive charge and  the  lower rod has an equal amount of negative charge. At  this  instant 
the  electric  field  near  the  antenna  points  downward. The  charges  then  begin  to  decrease. 
t T=
/ 4
After  one-fourth  period, 
,  the  charges  vanish  momentarily  and  the  electric  field 
strength  is  zero.  Subsequently,  the  polarities  of  the  rods  are  reversed  with  negative 
charges continuing to accumulate on the upper rod and positive charges on the lower until 
t T=
/ 2
,   when  the maximum  is  attained. At  this moment,  the  electric  field  near  the  rod 
points  upward.  As  the  charges  continue  to  oscillate  between  the  rods,  electric  fields  are 
produced and move away with speed of  light. The motion of  the charges also produces a 
current which  in  turn  sets up a magnetic  field encircling  the  rods. However,  the behavior 

 

22

of the fields near the antenna is expected to be very different from that far away from the 
antenna. 
 
Let us consider a half-wavelength antenna, in which the length of each rod is equal to one 
quarter  of  the  wavelength  of  the  emitted  radiation.  Since  charges  are  driven  to  oscillate 
back  and  forth  between  the  rods  by  the  alternating  voltage,  the  antenna  may  be 
approximated  as  an  oscillating  electric  dipole.  Figure  13.8.3  depicts  the  electric  and  the 
magnetic  field  lines  at  the  instant  the  current  is upward. Notice  that  the Poynting vectors 
at the positions shown are directed outward. 
 

 

 

Figure 13.8.3 Electric and magnetic field lines produced by an electric-dipole antenna. 

 
In general,  the  radiation pattern produced  is very complex. However, at a distance which 
is  much  greater  than  the  dimensions  of  the  system  and  the  wavelength  of  the  radiation, 
the fields exhibit a very different behavior. In this “far region,” the radiation is caused by 
the  continuous  induction of  a magnetic  field due  to a  time-varying electric  field and vice 
.  r
versa. Both fields oscillate in phase and vary in amplitude as 1 /
 
,  where 
θ is  the  angle 
The  intensity  of  the  variation  can  be  shown  to  vary  as 
/ rθ 2

I θ  is 
measured  from  the  axis  of  the  antenna.  The  angular  dependence  of  the  intensity  ( )
shown  in  Figure  13.8.4.  From  the  figure,  we  see  that  the  intensity  is  a  maximum  in  a 
plane which passes through the midpoint of the antenna and is perpendicular to it.

Even though the energy flow direction changes sign in these regions, there is still a small 
time-averaged energy flow outward. This small energy flow outward represents the small 
amount  of  energy  radiated  away  to  infinity. Outside  of  the  point  at which  the  outer  field 
lines  detach  from  the  dipole  and move  off  to  infinity,  the  velocity  of  the  field  lines,  and 
thus  the  direction  of  the  electromagnetic  energy  flow,  is  always  outward.  This  is  the 
region dominated by radiation fields, which consistently carry energy outward to infinity.

the  radiation.   A quarter-wave antenna produces  radiation whose wavelength  is  twice  the 
tip to tip length of the antenna.  This is evident in the animation of Figure 13.8.7(b).

13.8.1  Plane Waves 
 
We have seen  that electromagnetic plane waves propagate in empty space at the speed of 
light.  Below  we  demonstrate  how  one  would  create  such  waves  in  a  particularly  simple 
planar geometry. Although physically  this  is not particularly applicable  to  the real world, 
it  is  reasonably  easy  to  treat,  and  we  can  see  directly  how  electromagnetic  plane  waves 
are  generated,  why  it  takes  work  to  make  them,  and  how  much  energy  they  carry  away 
with them.   
 
To  make  an  electromagnetic  plane  wave,  we  do  much  the  same  thing  we  do  when  we 
make  waves  on  a  string.    We  grab  the  string  somewhere  and  shake  it,  and  thereby 

 

25

generate  a  wave  on  the  string.    We  do  work  against  the  tension  in  the  string  when  we 
shake  it,  and  that  work  is  carried  off  as  an  energy  flux  in  the  wave.    Electromagnetic 
waves  are much  the  same  proposition.    The  electric  field  line  serves  as  the  “string.”   As 
we will see below, there is a tension associated with an electric field line, in that when we 
shake  it  (try  to  displace  it  from  its  initial  position),  there  is  a  restoring  force  that  resists 
the  shake,  and  a  wave  propagates  along  the  field  line  as  a  result  of  the  shake.    To 
understand  in  detail  what  happens  in  this  process  will  involve  using  most  of  the 
electromagnetism  we  have  learned  thus  far,  from  Gauss's  law  to  Ampere's  law  plus  the 
reasonable  assumption  that  electromagnetic  information  propagates  at  speed  c  in  a 
vacuum. 
 
How do we shake an electric field line, and what do we grab on to?  What we do is shake 
the  electric  charges  that  the  field  lines  are  attached  to.    After  all,  it  is  these  charges  that 
produce  the  electric  field,  and  in  a  very  real  sense  the  electric  field  is  "rooted"  in  the 
electric  charges  that  produce  them.    Knowing  this,  and  assuming  that  in  a  vacuum, 
electromagnetic  signals  propagate  at  the  speed  of  light,  we  can  pretty  much  puzzle  out 
how to make a plane electromagnetic wave by shaking charges.  Let's first figure out how 
to make a kink in an electric field line, and then we'll go on to make sinusoidal waves.   
 
Suppose we have an infinite sheet of charge located in the 
surface charge density

The “foot” of  this electric  field  line,  that  is, where  it  is anchored,  is  rooted  in  the electric 
charge that generates it, and that “foot” must move downward with the sheet of charge, at 
the same speed as the charges move downward.  Thus the “foot” of our electric field line,

 along  the  x-axis  from  the  origin  doesn't  know  the  charges  are

appear  at  time  t

This  is only half of  the work we do per unit  time per unit  area  to pull  the  sheet down,  as 
given  by  Eq.  (13.8.9).    Since  the  fields  on  the  left  carry  exactly  the  same  amount  of 
(cid:71)

 does  not,  so  the  Poynting  flux  also  changes  across 
whereas  the  electric  field 
So  the  total  energy  flux  carried  off  by  the  perturbation  electric  and  magnetic  fields  we 
have generated  is exactly equal  to  the  rate of work per unit area  to pull  the charged sheet 
down  against  the  tension  in  the  electric  field.  Thus  we  have  generated  perturbation 
electromagnetic fields that carry off energy at exactly the rate that it takes to create them.

Where does the energy carried off by the electromagnetic wave come from? The external 
agent who originally “shook”  the charge  to produce  the wave had  to do work against  the 
perturbation  electric  field  the  shaking  produces,  and  that  agent  is  the  ultimate  source  of 
the  energy  carried  by  the  wave.    An  exactly  analogous  situation  exists  when  one  asks 
where  the  energy  carried  by  a  wave  on  a  string  comes  from.    The  agent  who  originally 
shook  the  string  to  produce  the  wave  had  to  do  work  to  shake  it  against  the  restoring 
tension  in  the string, and  that agent  is  the ultimate source of energy carried by a wave on 
a string.

How  about  generating  a  sinusoidal wave  with  angular  frequency ω?  To  do  this,  instead

that  Eqs.  (13.8.13)  and  (13.8.14)  are  precisely  the  kinds  of  plane  electromagnetic waves

simply  putting  a  stationary  charged  sheet  with  charge  per  unit  area  σ−  at

charged  sheet will  cancel  out  the  static  field  due  to  the  positive  sheet  of  charge,  but will 
not affect  the perturbation  field we have calculated, since  the negatively-charged sheet  is 
not moving.    In  reality,  that  is how electromagnetic waves are generated--with an overall 
neutral  medium  where  charges  of  one  sign  (usually  the  electrons)  are  accelerated  while 
an  equal  number  of  charges  of  the  opposite  sign  essentially  remain  at  rest.    Thus  an 
observer  only  sees  the  wave  fields,  and  not  the  static  fields.    In  the  following,  we  will

Figure 13.9.4 Electric field generated by the oscillation of a current sheet. 

 
 
The  electric  field  generated  by  the  oscillation  of  the  current  sheet  is  shown  in  Figure 
13.8.11,  for  the  instant when  the sheet  is moving down and  the perturbation electric  field 
is up. The magnetic fields, which point into or out of the page, are also shown.   
 
What we have accomplished  in  the construction here, which  really only assumes  that  the 
feet of the electric field lines move with the charges, and that information propagates at  c  
is  to  show  we  can  generate  such  a  wave  by  shaking  a  plane  of  charge  sinusoidally.  The 
wave  we  generate  has  electric  and  magnetic  fields  perpendicular  to  one  another,  and 
transverse to the direction of propagation, with the ratio of the electric field magnitude to 
the  magnetic  field  magnitude  equal  to  the  speed  of  light.    Moreover,  we  see  directly

in detail, but the overall picture remains as we have presented it.

electromagnetism  course,  you  will  study  the  radiation  fields  generated  by  a  single 
oscillating  charge,  and  find  that  they  are  proportional  to  the  acceleration  of  the  charge.  
This  is  very  different  from  the  case  here,  where  the  radiation  fields  of  our  oscillating 
sheet  of  charge  are  proportional  to  the  velocity  of  the  charges.    However,  there  is  no 
contradiction,  because when  you  add  up  the  radiation  fields  due  to  all  the  single  charges 
making up our sheet, you recover the same result we give  in Eqs. (13.8.15) and (13.8.16) 
(see Chapter 30, Section 7, of Feynman, Leighton, and Sands, The Feynman Lectures on 
Physics, Vol 1, Addison-Wesley, 1963).

13.10  Appendix: Reflection of Electromagnetic Waves at Conducting Surfaces  
 
How does a very good conductor reflect an electromagnetic wave falling on it?  In words, 
what  happens  is  the  following.    The  time-varying  electric  field  of  the  incoming  wave 
drives  an oscillating  current on  the  surface of  the  conductor,  following Ohm's  law.   That 
oscillating current sheet, of necessity, must generate waves propagating in both directions 
from the sheet.  One of these waves is the reflected wave.  The other wave cancels out the 
incoming wave inside the conductor.  Let us make this qualitative description quantitative.

Suppose we have an infinite plane wave propagating in the +x-direction, with  
 
 
 
0x =
as  shown  in  the  top portion of Figure  13.10.1. We  put  at  the  origin  (
)  a  conducting 
sheet with width 
, which is much smaller than the wavelength of the incoming wave.   
D
 
This  conducting  sheet  will  reflect  our  incoming  wave.    How?    The  electric  field  of  the

 to  flow  in  the  sheet,  where  ρ  is  the 
incoming  wave  will  cause  a  current 
resistivity (not to be confused with charge per unit volume), and is equal to the reciprocal 
of conductivity σ(not  to be confused with charge per unit area). Moreover,  the direction 
(cid:71)
J
 will be  in  the same direction as  the electric  field of  the  incoming wave, as shown  in 
of 
the  sketch.    Thus  our  incoming wave  sets  up  an  oscillating  sheet  of  current with  current 
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
D=K J
per unit  length
.   As  in our discussion of  the generation  of  plane  electromagnetic 
waves above, this current sheet will also generate electromagnetic waves, moving both to 
the  right  and  to  the  left  (see  lower  portion  of  Figure  13.10.1)  away  from  the  oscillating

 the wave generated by the current will be  
sheet of charge.  Using Eq. (13.8.15) for

We  shall  show  that  a  perfect  conductor  will  perfectly  reflect  an  incident  wave.  To 
approach  the  limit of a perfect conductor, we  first consider  the  finite  resistivity case, and 
then let the resistivity go to zero.   
 
For  simplicity,  we  assume  that  the  sheet  is  thin  compared  to  a  wavelength,  so  that  the 
entire  sheet  sees  essentially  the  same  electric  field.  This  implies  that  the  current  density 
(cid:71)

 will  be  uniform  across  the  thickness  of  the  sheet,  and  outside  of  the  sheet we will  see

13.11  Problem-Solving Strategy: Traveling Electromagnetic Waves 
 
This  chapter  explores  various  properties  of  the  electromagnetic  waves.  The  electric  and 
the  magnetic  fields  of  the  wave  obey  the  wave  equation.  Once  the  functional  form  of 
either  one  of  the  fields  is  given,  the  other  can  be  determined  from Maxwell’s  equations. 
As an example, let’s consider a sinusoidal electromagnetic wave with 
 
(cid:71)
E
z t
( , )
 
 
The equation above contains the complete information about the electromagnetic wave: 
 
1.  Direction  of  wave  propagation:  The  argument  of  the  sine  form  in  the  electric  field 
can be rewritten as  (

(b) By  integrating  S
 over  the  cylindrical  boundary,  show  that  the  rate  at  which  energy 
enters the capacitor is equal to the rate at which electrostatic energy is being stored in the 
electric field.  
 
Solutions:

direction.  Suppose  at  some  instant  the  amount  of  charge  accumulated  on  the  positive

13.14  Additional Problems 
 
13.14.1  Solar Sailing 
 
It has been proposed  that a spaceship might be propelled  in  the solar system by  radiation 
pressure, using a large sail made of foil.  How large must the sail be if the radiation force 
is to be equal in magnitude to the Sun's gravitational attraction?  Assume that the mass of 
the  ship  and  sail  is  1650  kg,  that  the  sail  is  perfectly  reflecting,  and  that  the  sail  is 
oriented at right angles to the Sun’s rays. Does your answer depend on where in the solar 
system the spaceship is located?   
 
 
13.14.2  Reflections of True Love 
 
(a)  A  light  bulb  puts  out  100  W  of  electromagnetic  radiation.  What  is  the  time-average 
intensity of radiation from this light bulb at a distance of one meter from the bulb?   What 
0E
0B , at  this same distance 
and 
are  the maximum values of electric and magnetic  fields, 
from the bulb?  Assume a plane wave.   
 
(b) The face of your true love is one meter from this 100 W bulb. What maximum surface 
current must  flow  on  your  true  love's  face  in  order  to  reflect  the  light  from  the  bulb  into 
your  adoring  eyes?    Assume  that  your  true  love's  face  is  (what  else?)  perfect--perfectly 
smooth and perfectly  reflecting--and  that  the  incident  light and  reflected  light are normal 
to the surface. 
 
13.14.3  Coaxial Cable and Power Flow  
 
A  coaxial  cable  consists  of  two  concentric  long  hollow  cylinders  of  zero  resistance;  the

,  the  outer  has  radius  b ,  and  the  length  of  both  is  l , with 
inner  has  radius 
.   The 
cable transmits DC power from a battery to a load.  The battery provides an electromotive 
ε  between  the  two  conductors  at  one  end  of  the  cable,  and  the  load  is  a 
force 
resistance R  connected  between  the  two  conductors  at  the  other  end  of  the  cable.    A
