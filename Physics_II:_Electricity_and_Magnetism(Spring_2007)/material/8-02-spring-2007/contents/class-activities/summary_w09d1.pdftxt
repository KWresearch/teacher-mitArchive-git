Topic Introduction 

So far in this class magnetic fields and electric fields have been fairly well isolated.  Electric 
fields are generated by static charges, magnetic fields by moving charges (currents).  In each 
of these cases the fields have been static – we have had constant charges or currents making 
constant electric or magnetic fields.  Today we make two major changes to what we have 
seen before:  we consider the interaction of these two types of fields, and we consider what 
happens when they are not static.  We will discuss the final Maxwell’s equation, Faraday’s 
law, which explains that electric fields can be generated not only by charges but also by 
magnetic fields that vary in time. 

Faraday’s Law 
It is not entirely surprising that electricity and magnetism are connected.  We have seen, after 
all, that if an electric field is used to accelerate charges (make a current) that a magnetic field 
can result.  Faraday’s law, however, is something completely new.  We can now forget about 
charges completely.  What Faraday discovered is that a changing magnetic flux generates an 
EMF (electromotive force).  Mathematically:

In the formula above,  E′ is the electric field measured in the rest frame of the circuit, if the 
circuit is moving.   The above formula is deceptively simple, so I will discuss several 
important points to consider when thinking about Faraday’s law.  

WARNING:  First, a warning.  Many students confuse Faraday’s Law with Ampere’s Law.  
Both involve integrating around a loop and comparing that to an integral across the area 
bounded by that loop.  Aside from this mathematical similarity, however, the two laws are 
completely different.  In Ampere’s law the field that is “curling around the loop” is the

magnetic field, created by a “current flux”  ( I  = ∫∫ J A  )  that is penetrating the looping B 
⋅ d 
field.  In Faraday’s law the electric field is curling, created by a changing magnetic flux.  In 
fact, there need not be any currents at all in the problem, although as we will see below 
typically the EMF is measured by its ability to drive a current around a physical loop – a 
circuit.  Keeping these differences in mind, let’s continue to some details of Faraday’s law. 
EMF:  How does the EMF become apparent?  Typically, when doing 
I 
Faraday’s law problems there will be a physical loop, a closed circuit, 
such as the one pictured at left.  The EMF is then observed as an 
electromotive force that drives a current in the circuit:  ε= I R .  In 
this case, the path walked around in calculating the EMF is the circuit, and hence the 
associated area across which the magnetic flux is calculated is the rectangular area bordered 
by the circuit.  Although this is the most typical initial use of Faraday’s law, it is not the only 
one – we will see that it can be applied in “empty space” space as well, to determine the 
creation of electric fields.

Changing Magnetic Flux:  How do we get the magnetic flux ΦB to change?  Looking at the

of the field, the area of the loop, or the angle of the loop.  These methods are shown below.

In each of the cases pictured above, the magnetic flux into the page is decreasing with time 
(because the (1) B field, (2) loop area or (3) projected area are decreasing with time).  This 
decreasing flux creates an EMF.  In which direction?  We can use Lenz’s Law to find out. 

Lenz’s Law 
Lenz’s Law is a non-mathematical statement of Faraday’s Law.  It says that systems will 
always act to oppose changes in magnetic flux.  For example, in each of the above cases the 
flux into the page is decreasing with time.  The loop doesn’t want a decreased flux, so it will 
generate a clockwise EMF, which will drive a clockwise current, creating a B field into the 
page (inside the loop) to make up for the lost flux.  This, by the way, is the meaning of the 
minus sign in Faraday’s law.  I recommend that you use Lenz’s Law to determine the 
direction of the EMF and then use Faraday’s Law to calculate the amplitude.  By the way, 
just as with Faraday’s Law, you don’t need a physical circuit to use Lenz’s Law.  Just 
pretend that there is a wire in which current could flow and ask what direction it would need 
to flow in order to oppose the changing flux.  In general, opposing a change in flux means 
opposing what is happening to change the flux (e.g. forces or torques oppose the change). 

Applications 
A number of technologies rely on induction to work – generators, microphones, metal 
detectors, and electric guitars to name a few.  Another common application is eddy current 
braking.  A magnetic field penetrating a metal spinning disk (like a wheel) will induce eddy 
currents in the disk, currents which circle inside the disk and exert a torque on the disk, 
trying to stop it from rotating.  This kind of braking system is commonly used in trains.  Its 
major benefit (aside from eliminating costly service to maintain brake pads) is that the 
braking torque is proportional to angular velocity of the wheel, meaning that the ride 
smoothly comes to a halt.
