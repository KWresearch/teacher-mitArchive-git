LC Circuit 
It undergoes simple harmonic motion, just like a 
mass on a spring, with trade-off between charge on 
capacitor (Spring) and current in inductor (Mass)

Analog:  RLC Circuit 

Recall: 
Inductors are like masses (have inertia) 
Capacitors are like springs (store/release energy) 
Batteries supply external force (EMF) 

Charge on capacitor is like position, 
Current is like velocity – watch them resonate 

Now we move to “frequency dependent batteries:” 
AC Power Supplies/AC Function Generators
