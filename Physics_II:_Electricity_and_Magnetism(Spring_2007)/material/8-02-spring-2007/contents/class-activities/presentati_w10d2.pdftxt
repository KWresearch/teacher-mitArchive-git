Mutual Inductance
A current I2 in coil 2, induces some 
magnetic flux Φ12 in coil 1.  We 
define the flux in terms of a “mutual 
inductance” M12:

Group Problem: Solenoid

Calculate the self-inductance L of a 
solenoid (n turns per meter, length (cid:65), 
radius R)

t=0+: Current is trying to change.  Inductor works as 
hard as it needs to to stop it
t=∞: Current is steady.  Inductor does nothing.

Group Problem: LR Circuit

1. What direction does the current flow just after 
turning off the battery (at t=0+)?  At t=∞?
2. Write a differential equation for the circuit
3. Solve and plot I vs. t and voltmeters vs. t
