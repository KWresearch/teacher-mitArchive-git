TEST ONE Thursday Evening 7:30 - 9:30 pm .  The Friday class immediately 
following is canceled because of the evening exam. 
 
What We Expect From You On The Exam 

 
(1) Ability to calculate the electric field of both discrete and continuous charge distributions.  
We may give you a problem on setting up the integral for a continuous charge distribution, 
although we do not necessarily expect you to do the integral, unless it is particularly straight 
forward.  You should be able to set up problems like: calculating the field of a small number 
of point charges, the field of the perpendicular bisector of a finite line of charge; the field on 
the axis of a ring of charge; and so on.   
 
(2) To be able to recognize and draw the electric field line patterns for a small number of 
discrete charges, for example, from two point charges (of same or opposite charge) 
 
(3) To be able to apply the principle of superposition to electrostatic problems.

(5) An understanding of how to calculate the electric potential of a discrete set of charges and

a continuous set of charges, that is the use of the equation  V ( r) =

potential of N charges qi located at positions ri. Also you must know how to calculate the 
configuration energy necessary to assemble this set of charges.  For a continuous charge 
distribution, you must know how to set up the integrand for the electric potential

(7) The ability to calculate the electric potential given the electric field and the electric field 
given the electric potential, e.g. being able to apply the equations

  and   E = −∇V .

(8) An understanding of how to use Gauss's Law.  In particular, we may give you a problem 
that involves either finding the electric field of a uniformly or non-uniformly filled cylinder, 
slab or sphere of charge, as well as the potential associated with that electric field.  You must 
be able to explain the steps involved in this process clearly, and in particular to argue how to

(9) An understanding of capacitors: how to calculate capacitance, how do find the energy 
stored in a capacitor. 
 
(10) To be able to answer qualitative conceptual questions that require no calculation.  There will 
be concept questions similar to those done in class. 
 
(11) An understanding of the first two experiments. 
 
To  study  for  this  exam  (which  you  should DEFINITELY DO!) we  suggest  that 
you  review  your  problem  sets,  in-class  problems,  Friday  problem  solving 
sessions, PRS  in-class questions, and  relevant parts of  the study guide and class 
notes and work through multiple past exams
