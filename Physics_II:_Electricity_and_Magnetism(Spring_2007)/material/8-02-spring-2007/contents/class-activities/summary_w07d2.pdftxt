Topic Introduction 

 
In this class we will begin by looking at some examples of using magnetic forces to levitate 
various objects – frogs, sumo wrestlers, etc.  The bulk of the class will be spent doing an 
experiment to see the forces and torques on magnetic dipoles that we discussed in theory in 
Monday’s class. 
 
Magnetic Levitation  
Last time we saw that when magnetic dipoles are in non-uniform fields that they feel a force. 
If they are aligned with the field they tend to seek the strongest field (just as electric dipoles 
in a non-uniform electric field do). If they are anti-aligned with the field they tend to seek the 
weakest field. These facts can be easily seen by considering the energy of a dipole in a 
(cid:71)(cid:71)
= − ⋅µ B
magnetic field: U
. Unfortunately these forces can’t be used to stably levitate simple 
bar magnets (try it – repulsive levitation modes are unstable to flipping, and attractive 
levitation modes are unstable to “snapping” to contact). However, they can be used to levitate 
diamagnets – materials who have a magnetic moment which always points opposite the 
direction of field in which they are sitting. We begin briefly discussing magnetic materials, 
for now just know that most materials are diamagnetic (water is, and hence so are frogs), and 
that hence they don’t like magnetic fields. Using this, we can levitate them.  
 
Neat, but is it useful? Possibly yes. Magnetic levitation allows the creation of frictionless 
bearings, Maglev (magnetically levitated) trains, and, of course, floating frogs.  
 
Magnetic Dipole Moment 
The rest of the class will be spent doing an experiment where you get to 
observe the motion of a magnetic dipole in an external field created by a 
Helmholtz coil (the same one you measured the field profile of last week).  
In thinking about the field profile of the Helmholtz coil, remember that coils 
(cid:71)

, where I is the current 
are magnetic dipoles with the dipole moment 
I=µ A
in the loop and the direction of A, the area vector, is determined by a right 
hand rule:  
 
Right Hand Rule for Direction of Dipole Moment 
To determine the direction of the dipole moment of a coil of wire:  wrap 
your fingers in the direction of current.  Your thumb points in the direction 
of the North pole of the dipole (in the direction of the dipole moment µ of 
the coil).

Magnetic Dipole Moments in External Fields 
You will observe both the torque and force that a dipole can feel in an external field.  Recall 
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
– and 
that the magnet will only feel a torque if not aligned with the external field –  = ×
τ µ B
that the direction of the torque tends to align the dipole with the external field.   
 
There will only be a force on the dipole if it is in a non-uniform field.  If aligned with the 
external field, the dipole will seek higher field (it will climb the gradient) in order to

Experiment 4:  Forces and Torques on Magnetic Dipoles 
Preparation:  Read pre-lab and answer pre-lab questions 
 
This lab will be performed through a combination of lecture demonstrations and table top 
measurements.  The goal is to understand the forces and torques on magnetic dipoles in 
uniform and non-uniform magnetic fields.  To investigate this we use the “TeachSpin 
apparatus,” which consists of a Helmholtz coil (two wire coils that can produce either 
uniform or non-uniform magnetic fields depending on the direction of current flow in the 
coils) and a small magnet which is free both to move and rotate.
