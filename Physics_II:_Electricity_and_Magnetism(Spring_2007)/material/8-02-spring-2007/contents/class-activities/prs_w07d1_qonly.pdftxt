Parallel Wires 
Consider two 
parallel current 
carrying wires.  
With the currents 
running in the 
same direction, 
the wires are 
 
1. attracted (likes attract?) 
2. repelled (likes repel?) 
3. pushed in another 
direction 
4. not pushed – no net force

The coil above will: 
1.  rotate clockwise, not move 
2.  rotate countercw, not move 
3.  move to the right, no rotation 
4.  move to the left, no rotation 
5.  move in another direction, 
without rotation 
6.  move and rotate 
7.  no net force so no rotation or 
motion

The current carrying coil 
above will move  
1. upwards 
2. downwards 
3. stay where it is because 
the total force is zero

The current-carrying coil

Free dipoles attract because: 
1. The force between dipoles 
is always attractive 
independent of orientation. 
2. A dipole will always move 
towards stronger field, 
independent of orientation. 
3. The torque on the dipole 
aligns it with the local field 
and the dipole will then 
move toward stronger field 
strength.
