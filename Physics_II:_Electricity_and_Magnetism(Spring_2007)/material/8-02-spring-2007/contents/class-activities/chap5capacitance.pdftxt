5.1 Introduction  
 
A  capacitor  is  a  device  which  stores  electric  charge.    Capacitors  vary  in  shape  and  size, 
but  the basic configuration  is  two conductors carrying equal but opposite charges (Figure 
5.1.1).  Capacitors  have  many  important  applications  in  electronics.  Some  examples 
include  storing  electric  potential  energy,  delaying  voltage  changes  when  coupled  with 
resistors,  filtering  out  unwanted  frequency  signals,  forming  resonant  circuits  and making 
frequency-dependent  and  independent  voltage  dividers  when  combined  with  resistors. 
Some of these applications will be discussed in latter chapters. 
 

Figure 5.1.1 Basic configuration of a capacitor. 

 
In the uncharged state, the charge on either one of the conductors in the capacitor is zero. 
During  the  charging  process,  a  charge  Q  is moved  from  one  conductor  to  the  other  one, 
giving  one  conductor  a  charge  Q+ ,  and  the  other  one  a  charge 
.  A  potential 
Q−
V∆
difference 
is created, with  the positively charged conductor at a higher potential  than 
the negatively charged conductor. Note that whether charged or uncharged, the net charge 
on the capacitor as a whole is zero.  
 
The  simplest  example  of  a  capacitor  consists  of  two  conducting  plates  of  area A ,  which 
are parallel to each other, and separated by a distance d, as shown in Figure 5.1.2.

where  C  is  a  positive  proportionality  constant  called  capacitance.    Physically, 
capacitance  is  a  measure  of  the  capacity  of  storing  electric  charge  for  a  given  potential

5.2 Calculation of Capacitance 
 
Let’s see how capacitance can be computed in systems with simple geometry. 
 

Example 5.1: Parallel-Plate Capacitor 
 
Consider  two  metallic  plates  of  equal  area  A  separated  by  a  distance  d,  as  shown  in 
Figure  5.2.1  below.  The  top  plate  carries  a  charge  +Q  while  the  bottom  plate  carries  a 
charge  –Q. The  charging  of  the  plates  can  be  accomplished  by means  of  a  battery which 
produces a potential difference. Find the capacitance of the system. 
 

 

 

 

Figure 5.2.1    The electric field between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor 

 
Solution:  
 
To  find  the  capacitance C, we  first  need  to  know  the  electric  field  between  the  plates. A 
real capacitor is finite in size. Thus, the electric field lines at the edge of the plates are not 
straight lines, and the field is not contained entirely between the plates.  This is known as 

 

3

edge  effects,  and  the  non-uniform  fields  near  the  edge  are  called  the  fringing  fields.  In 
Figure 5.2.1 the field lines are drawn by taking  into consideration edge effects. However, 
in  what  follows,  we  shall  ignore  such  effects  and  assume  an  idealized  situation,  where 
field lines between the plates are straight lines.  
 
In  the  limit where  the plates  are  infinitely  large,  the  system has planar  symmetry  and we 
can calculate the electric field everywhere using Gauss’s law given in Eq. (4.2.5):

By choosing a Gaussian “pillbox” with cap area  A′  to enclose  the charge on  the positive 
plate (see Figure 5.2.2), the electric field in the region between the plates is

The potential difference between the plates is  
 
 
 
where we have taken the path of integration to be a straight line from the positive plate to 
the negative plate following the field lines (Figure 5.2.2). Since the electric field lines are 
V

always  directed  from  higher  potential  to  lower  potential,

−
computing  the  capacitance  C,  the  relevant  quantity  is  the  magnitude  of  the  potential 
difference: 
  
 
 
and its sign is immaterial. From the definition of capacitance, we have

Note  that C  depends  only  on  the  geometric  factors A  and  d. The  capacitance C  increases 
linearly with the area A since for a given potential difference  V∆ , a bigger plate can hold 
more  charge.  On  the  other  hand,  C  is  inversely  proportional  to  d,  the  distance  of 
separation  because  the  smaller  the  value  of  d,  the  smaller  the  potential  difference  |
 
|V∆
for a fixed Q. 
 

Interactive Simulation 5.1:  Parallel-Plate Capacitor 
 
This  simulation  shown  in  Figure  5.2.3  illustrates  the  interaction  of  charged  particles 
inside the two plates of a capacitor.  
 

 

 
Figure 5.2.3 Charged particles interacting inside the two plates of a capacitor. 

 
Each  plate  contains  twelve  charges  interacting  via  Coulomb  force,  where  one  plate 
contains  positive  charges  and  the  other  contains  negative  charges.  Because  of  their 
mutual  repulsion,  the  particles  in  each  plate  are  compelled  to  maximize  the  distance 
between  one  another,  and  thus  spread  themselves  evenly  around  the  outer  edge  of  their 
enclosure. However, the particles in one plate are attracted to the particles in the other, so 
they  attempt  to  minimize  the  distance  between  themselves  and  their  oppositely  charged 
correspondents. Thus,  they distribute  themselves along  the  surface of  their bounding box 
closest to the other plate. 
 

Example 5.2: Cylindrical Capacitor 
 
Consider  next  a  solid  cylindrical  conductor  of  radius  a  surrounded  by  a  coaxial 
cylindrical  shell of  inner  radius b, as  shown  in Figure 5.2.4. The  length of both cylinders 
is L  and we  take  this  length  to  be much  larger  than  b− a,  the  separation  of  the  cylinders, 
so  that  edge  effects  can  be  neglected. The  capacitor  is  charged  so  that  the  inner  cylinder 
has charge +Q while the outer shell has a charge –Q. What is the capacitance?

Solution: 
 
To  calculate  the  capacitance,  we  first  compute  the  electric  field  everywhere.  Due  to  the 
cylindrical  symmetry  of  the  system,  we  choose  our  Gaussian  surface  to  be  a  coaxial 
 and radius r where  a r b

Example 5.3: Spherical Capacitor 
 
As  a  third  example,  let’s  consider  a  spherical  capacitor which  consists  of  two  concentric 
spherical  shells  of  radii  a  and  b,  as  shown  in  Figure  5.2.5.  The  inner  shell  has  a  charge 
+Q  uniformly  distributed  over  its  surface,  and  the  outer  shell  an  equal  but  opposite 
charge –Q. What is the capacitance of this configuration?

Again, the capacitance C depends only on the physical dimensions, a and b. 
 
An  “isolated”  conductor  (with  the  second  conductor  placed  at  infinity)  also  has  a

5.3 Capacitors in Electric Circuits  
 
A  capacitor  can  be  charged  by  connecting  the  plates  to  the  terminals  of  a  battery, which 
are maintained at a potential difference  V∆  called the terminal voltage.

Figure 5.3.1 Charging a capacitor. 

 

 
The  connection  results  in  sharing  the  charges  between  the  terminals  and  the  plates.  For 
example,  the plate  that  is connected  to  the  (positive) negative  terminal will acquire  some 
(positive)  negative  charge.  The  sharing  causes  a momentary  reduction  of  charges  on  the 
terminals, and a decrease in the terminal voltage. Chemical reactions are then triggered to 
transfer more  charge  from one  terminal  to  the other  to  compensate  for  the  loss of  charge 
to  the  capacitor  plates,  and  maintain  the  terminal  voltage  at  its  initial  level.  The  battery 
could  thus  be  thought  of  as  a  charge  pump  that  brings  a  charge  Q from  one  plate  to  the 
other.

2
connected in parallel, as shown in Figure 5.3.2.

The  left  plates  of  both  capacitors C1  and C2  are  connected  to  the  positive  terminal  of  the 
battery and have  the same electric potential as  the positive  terminal. Similarly, both right 
plates are negatively charged and have  the same potential as  the negative  terminal. Thus,

5.3.2 Series Connection 
 
Suppose  two  initially  uncharged  capacitors  C1   and  C2  are  connected  in  series,  as  shown 
in Figure 5.3.3.   A potential difference  |
 is  then applied across both capacitors.   The 
|V∆
left  plate  of  capacitor  1  is  connected  to  the  positive  terminal  of  the  battery  and  becomes 
positively  charged with  a  charge  +Q, while  the  right  plate  of  capacitor  2  is  connected  to 
the  negative  terminal  and  becomes  negatively  charged with  charge  –Q  as  electrons  flow 
in.  What  about  the  inner  plates?  They  were  initially  uncharged;  now  the  outside  plates 
each  attract  an  equal  and opposite  charge. So  the  right plate of  capacitor 1 will  acquire  a 
charge –Q and the left plate of capacitor +Q.

respectively.    From  Figure  5.3.3,  we  see  that  the  total  potential  difference  is  simply  the 
sum of the two individual potential differences: 
 
 
 
In fact, the total potential difference across any number of capacitors in series connection 
is  equal  to  the  sum  of  potential  differences  across  the  individual  capacitors.  These  two

As  discussed  in  the  introduction,  capacitors  can  be  used  to  stored  electrical  energy.  The 
amount  of  energy  stored  is  equal  to  the  work  done  to  charge  it.  During  the  charging 
process,  the  battery  does  work  to  remove  charges  from  one  plate  and  deposit  them  onto 
the other.  
 

 

 
Figure  5.4.1  Work  is  done  by  an  external  agent  in  bringing  +dq  from  the  negative  plate  and 
depositing the charge on the positive plate.  
 
Let  the  capacitor  be  initially  uncharged.    In  each  plate  of  the  capacitor,  there  are  many 
negative and positive charges, but the number of negative charges balances the number of 
positive charges, so that there is no net charge, and therefore no electric field between the 
plates.   We have a magic bucket and a set of stairs  from  the bottom plate  to  the  top plate 
(Figure 5.4.1).

dq+
dq−
Having emptied the bucket of charge, we now descend the stairs, get another bucketful of 
charge +dq, go back up  the stairs and dump  that charge on  the  top plate.   We  then repeat 
this  process  over  and  over.    In  this way we  build  up  charge  on  the  capacitor,  and  create 
electric field where there was none initially.   
 
Suppose  the  amount  of  charge  on  the  top  plate  at  some  instant  is  q+ ,  and  the  potential

Interactive Simulation 5.2: Charge Placed  between Capacitor Plates 
 
This applet shown in Figure 5.4.2 is a simulation of an experiment in which an aluminum 
sphere  sitting  on  the  bottom  plate  of  a  capacitor  is  lifted  to  the  top  plate  by  the 
electrostatic  force  generated  as  the  capacitor  is  charged.  We  have  placed  a  non-

 

13

conducting  barrier  just  below  the  upper  plate  to  prevent  the  sphere  from  touching  it  and 
discharging. 
 

 

 
Figure  5.4.2  Electrostatic  force  experienced  by  an  aluminum  sphere  placed  between  the 
plates of a parallel-plate capacitor. 
 
While  the  sphere  is  in  contact with  the  bottom  plate,  the  charge  density  of  the  bottom  of 
the  sphere  is  the  same  as  that  of  the  lower  plate.  Thus,  as  the  capacitor  is  charged,  the 
charge  density  on  the  sphere  increases  proportional  to  the  potential  difference  between 
the  plates.  In  addition,  energy  flows  in  to  the  region  between  the  plates  as  the  electric 
field  builds  up.  This  can  be  seen  in  the  motion  of  the  electric  field  lines  as  they  move 
from the edge to the center of the capacitor. 
 
As  the  potential  difference  between  the  plates  increases,  the  sphere  feels  an  increasing 
attraction  towards  the  top  plate,  indicated  by  the  increasing  tension  in  the  field  as  more 
field  lines  "attach"  to  it.  Eventually  this  tension  is  enough  to  overcome  the  downward 
force of gravity, and  the sphere  is  lifted. Once separated  from  the  lower plate,  the sphere 
charge density no  longer  increases, and  it feels both an attractive force towards the upper 
plate (whose charge is roughly opposite that of the sphere) and a repulsive force from the 
lower one  (whose  charge  is  roughly  equal  to  that of  the  sphere). The  result  is  a net  force 
upwards.

5.5 Dielectrics 
 
In  many  capacitors  there  is  an  insulating  material  such  as  paper  or  plastic  between  the 
plates. Such material, called a dielectric, can be used  to maintain a physical separation of 
the  plates.  Since  dielectrics  break  down  less  readily  than  air,  charge  leakage  can  be 
minimized, especially when high voltage is applied.  
 
Experimentally  it  was  found  that  capacitance  C  increases  when  the  space  between  the 
conductors  is  filled with  dielectrics.  To  see  how  this  happens,  suppose  a  capacitor  has  a 
0C
capacitance
 when there is no material between the plates. When a dielectric material is 
inserted to completely fill the space between the plates, the capacitance increases to

have

which is the maximum value of electric field before breakdown occurs and charges begin 
to flow.

The fact that capacitance increases in the presence of a dielectric can be explained from a 
molecular  point  of  view. We  shall  show  that
eκ is  a measure  of  the  dielectric  response  to 
an  external  electric  field.  There  are  two  types  of  dielectrics.  The  first  type  is  polar 
dielectrics,  which  are  dielectrics  that  have  permanent  electric  dipole  moments.  An 
example of this type of dielectric is water.

opposite to the applied field but smaller in magnitude. 
 
The  second  type  of  dielectrics  is  the  non-polar  dielectrics,  which  are  dielectrics  that  do 
not  possess  permanent  electric  dipole  moment.  Electric  dipole  moments  can  be  induced 
by placing the materials in an externally applied electric field.

5.5.1  Polarization 
 
We  have  shown  that  dielectric  materials  consist  of  many  permanent  or  induced  electric 
dipoles.    One  of  the  concepts  crucial  to  the  understanding  of  dielectric  materials  is  the 
average  electric  field  produced  by  many  little  electric  dipoles  which  are  all  aligned.  
Suppose we have  a piece of material  in  the  form of  a  cylinder with  area A    and height h, 
as  shown  in  Figure  5.5.3,  and  that  it  consists  of  N  electric  dipoles,  each  with  electric 
(cid:71)
dipole moment  p  spread uniformly throughout the volume of the cylinder.   
 

 

 
Figure 5.5.3 A cylinder with uniform dipole distribution. 
 
We  furthermore  assume  for  the  moment  that  all  of  the  electric  dipole  moments  p(cid:71)  are 
aligned with  the  axis  of  the  cylinder. Since  each  electric  dipole  has  its  own  electric  field 
associated with  it,  in  the absence of any external electric  field,  if we average over all  the 
individual  fields produced by  the dipole, what  is  the average electric  field  just due  to  the 
presence of the aligned dipoles?   
 
(cid:71)
To  answer  this  question,  let  us  define  the  polarization  vector  P
dipole moment vector per unit volume:

Now,  what  is  the  average  electric  field  these  dipoles  produce?    The  key  to  figuring  this

Figure  5.5.4(b),  where  all  the  little  ±  charges  associated  with  the  electric  dipoles  in  the

Figure  5.5.4  (a)  A  cylinder  with  uniform  dipole  distribution.  (b)  Equivalent  charge

The equivalence can be seen by noting that in the interior of the cylinder, positive charge 
at the top of any one of the electric dipoles is canceled on average by the negative charge 
of  the  dipole  just  above  it.    The  only  place where  cancellation  does  not  take  place  is  for 
electric  dipoles  at  the  top  of  the  cylinder,  since  there  are  no  adjacent  dipoles  further  up.  
Thus  the  interior  of  the  cylinder  appears  uncharged  in  an  average  sense  (averaging  over 
many  dipoles),  whereas  the  top  surface  of  the  cylinder  appears  to  carry  a  net  positive 
charge.    Similarly,  the  bottom  surface  of  the  cylinder will  appear  to  carry  a  net  negative 
charge.

the dipoles.  If we go close to any individual dipole, we will see a very different field. 
 
We  have  assumed  here  that  all  our  electric  dipoles  are  aligned.    In  general,  if  these

Thus, we  see  that  the effect of dielectric materials  is always  to decrease  the electric  field 
below what it would otherwise be.

5.6 Creating Electric Fields 
 

Animation 5.1: Creating an Electric Dipole 
 
 
Electric  fields  are  created  by  electric  charge.    If  there  is  no  electric  charge  present,  and 
there  never  has  been  any  electric  charge  present  in  the  past,  then  there  would  be  no 
electric field anywhere is space.  How is electric field created and how does it come to fill 
up  space?    To  answer  this,  consider  the  following  scenario  in  which  we  go  from  the 
electric  field  being  zero  everywhere  in  space  to  an  electric  field  existing  everywhere  in 
space.   
 

 
 
 
Figure  5.6.1      Creating  an  electric  dipole.    (a)  Before  any  charge  separation.    (b)    Just 
after the charges are separated.  (c)  A long time after the charges are separated. 

 

25

 
Suppose we have a positive point charge sitting right on top of a negative electric charge, 
so  that  the  total  charge  exactly  cancels,  and  there  is  no  electric  field  anywhere  in  space.  
Now  let  us  pull  these  two  charges  apart  slightly,  so  that  they  are  separated  by  a  small 
distance.  If  we  allow  them  to  sit  at  that  distance  for  a  long  time,  there  will  now  be  a 
charge imbalance – an electric dipole. The dipole will create an electric field.   
 
Let  us  see  how  this  creation  of  electric  field  takes  place  in  detail.    Figure  5.6.1  shows 
three frames of an animation of  the process of separating the charges.   In Figure 5.6.1(a), 
there  is  no  charge  separation,  and  the  electric  field  is  zero  everywhere  in  space.    Figure 
5.6.1(b)  shows  what  happens  just  after  the  charges  are  first  separated.  An  expanding 
sphere  of  electric  fields  is  observed.  Figure  5.6.1(c)  is  a  long  time  after  the  charges  are 
separated (that is, they have been at a constant distance from another for a long time). An 
electric dipole has been created.  
 
 
What does this sequence tell us?  The following conclusions can be drawn: 
 
(1) It is electric charge that generates electric field — no charge, no field.   
 
(2)  The  electric  field  does  not  appear  instantaneously  in  space  everywhere  as  soon  as 
there  is  unbalanced  charge  —  the  electric  field  propagates  outward  from  its  source  at 
some finite speed.  This speed will turn out to be the speed of light, as we shall see later.   
 
(3)  After  the  charge  distribution  settles  down  and  becomes  stationary,  so  does  the  field 
configuration.    The  initial  field  pattern  associated  with  the  time  dependent  separation  of 
the  charge  is  actually  a  burst  of  “electric  dipole  radiation.”   We  return  to  the  subject  of 
radiation  at  the  end  of  this  course.   Until  then, we will  neglect  radiation  fields. The  field 
configuration  left  behind  after  a  long  time  is  just  the  electric  dipole  pattern  discussed 
above.  
 
We note  that  the external agent who pulls  the charges apart has  to do work  to keep  them 
separate,  since  they  attract  each  other  as  soon  as  they  start  to  separate.    Therefore,  the 
external work done  is  to overcome  the electrostatic attraction.    In addition,  the work also 
goes  into  providing  the  energy  carried  off  by  radiation,  as  well  as  the  energy  needed  to 
set up the final stationary electric field that we see in Figure 5.6.1(c). 
 

 
Figure  5.6.2  Creating  the  electric  fields  of  two  point  charges  by  pulling  apart  two 
opposite  charges  initially  on  top  of  one  another.   We  artificially  terminate  the  field  lines 
at a fixed distance from the charges to avoid visual confusion. 

 

 

26

 
Finally,  we  ignore  radiation  and  complete  the  process  of  separating  our  opposite  point 
charges that we began in Figure 5.6.1.  Figure 5.6.2 shows the complete sequence.  When 
we  finish  and  have  moved  the  charges  far  apart,  we  see  the  characteristic  radial  field  in 
the vicinity of a point charge.   
 

Animation 5.2: Creating and Destroying Electric Energy 
 
Let  us  look  at  the  process  of  creating  electric  energy  in  a  different  context.   We  ignore 
energy  losses  due  to  radiation  in  this  discussion.    Figure  5.6.3  shows  one  frame  of  an 
animation that illustrates the following process.   
   

 
Figure 5.6.3 Creating and destroying electric energy. 
We  start out with  five negative electric charges and  five positive charges, all at  the  same 
point  in  space.   Sine  there  is no net charge,  there  is no electric  field.   Now we move one 
of  the  positive  charges  at  constant  velocity  from  its  initial  position  to  a  distance  L  away 
along  the  horizontal  axis.  After  doing  that,  we  move  the  second  positive  charge  in  the 
same  manner  to  the  position  where  the  first  positive  charge  sits.    After  doing  that,  we 
continue on with the rest of the positive charges in the same manner, until all the positive 
charges  are  sitting  a  distance  L  from  their  initial  position  along  the  horizontal  axis.  
Figure 5.6.3  shows  the  field  configuration during  this process.   We have  color  coded  the 
“grass  seeds”  representation  to  represent  the  strength  of  the  electric  field.    Very  strong 
fields  are  white,  very  weak  fields  are  black,  and  fields  of  intermediate  strength  are 
yellow.   
 
Over the course of the “create” animation associated with Figure 5.6.3, the strength of the 
electric  field  grows  as  each  positive  charge  is  moved  into  place.    The  electric  energy 
flows  out  from  the  path  along  which  the  charges  move,  and  is  being  provided  by  the 
agent moving the charge against the electric field of the other charges. The work that this 
agent does to separate the charges against their electric attraction appears as energy in the 
electric  field.   We  also  have  an  animation  of  the  opposite  process  linked  to Figure  5.6.3.  
That is, we return in sequence each of the five positive charges to their original positions.  
At the end of this process we no longer have an electric field, because we no longer have 
an unbalanced electric charge.   
 
On  the  other  hand,  over  the  course  of  the  “destroy”  animation  associated  with  Figure 
5.6.3,  the  strength of  the electric  field decreases as each positive charge  is  returned  to  its 
original  position.    The  energy  flows  from  the  field  back  to  the  path  along  which  the 

 

27

charges  move,  and  is  now  being  provided  to  the  agent  moving  the  charge  at  constant 
speed  along  the  electric  field  of  the  other  charges.   The  energy  provided  to  that  agent  as 
we  destroy  the  electric  field  is  exactly  the  amount  of  energy  that  the  agent  put  into 
creating  the  electric  field  in  the  first  place,  neglecting  radiative  losses  (such  losses  are 
small  if we move  the  charges  at  speeds  small  compared  to  the  speed  of  light).    This  is  a 
totally  reversible  process  if  we  neglect  such  losses.  That  is,  the  amount  of  energy  the 
agent  puts  into  creating  the  electric  field  is  exactly  returned  to  that  agent  as  the  field  is 
destroyed.   
 
There  is  one  final  point  to  be made.   Whenever  electromagnetic  energy  is  being  created, 
(cid:71)(cid:71)
an  electric  charge  is  moving  (or  being  moved)  against  an  electric  field  (

•  A  capacitor  is  a  device  that  stores  electric  charge  and  potential  energy.  The

5.8 Appendix: Electric Fields Hold Atoms Together 
 
In  this  Appendix,  we  illustrate  how  electric  fields  are  responsible  for  holding  atoms 
together.

“…As  our  mental  eye  penetrates  into  smaller  and  smaller  distances  and 
shorter  and  shorter  times,  we  find  nature  behaving  so  entirely  differently 
from  what  we  observe  in  visible  and  palpable  bodies  of  our  surroundings 
that  no model  shaped  after  our  large-scale  experiences  can  ever  be  "true".  
A  completely  satisfactory  model  of  this  type  is  not  only  practically 
inaccessible, but not  even  thinkable.   Or,  to be precise, we  can, of  course, 
think of it, but however we think it, it is wrong.” 

Erwin Schroedinger  

 

5.8.1  Ionic and van der Waals Forces 
 
Electromagnetic  forces  provide  the  “glue”  that  holds  atoms  together—that  is,  that  keep 
electrons  near  protons  and  bind  atoms  together  in  solids.    We  present  here  a  brief  and 
very idealized model of how that happens from a semi-classical point of view.    
 

 (b) 
 (a) 
Figure  5.8.1  (a)  A  negative  charge  and  (b)  a  positive  charge  moves  past  a  massive 
positive particle at  the origin and  is deflected  from  its path by  the  stresses  transmitted by 
the electric fields surrounding the charges.  
 
Figure  5.8.1(a)  illustrates  the  examples  of  the  stresses  transmitted  by  fields,  as  we  have 
seen before.  In Figure 5.8.1(a) we have a negative charge moving past a massive positive 
charge  and  being  deflected  toward  that  charge  due  to  the  attraction  that  the  two  charges 
feel.   This  attraction  is mediated by  the  stresses  transmitted by  the  electromagnetic  field, 
and  the  simple  interpretation  of  the  interaction  shown  in  Figure  5.8.1(b)  is  that  the 
attraction  is  primarily  due  to  a  tension  transmitted  by  the  electric  fields  surrounding  the 
charges.   
 
In  Figure  5.8.1(b) we  have  a  positive  charge moving  past  a massive  positive  charge  and 
being  deflected  away  from  that  charge  due  to  the  repulsion  that  the  two  charges  feel.  
This  repulsion  is mediated by  the stresses  transmitted by  the electromagnetic field, as we 
have  discussed  above,  and  the  simple  interpretation  of  the  interaction  shown  in  Figure 
5.8.1(b)  is  that  the  repulsion  is  primarily  due  to  a  pressure  transmitted  by  the  electric 
fields surrounding the charges. 
 
 
Consider the interaction of four charges of equal mass shown in Figure 5.8.2.  Two of the 
charges  are  positively  charged  and  two  of  the  charges  are  negatively  charged,  and  all 
have the same magnitude of charge.  The particles interact via the Coulomb force.   

 

30

 
We  also  introduce  a  quantum-mechanical  “Pauli”  force,  which  is  always  repulsive  and 
becomes  very  important  at  small  distances,  but  is  negligible  at  large  distances.    The 
critical distance at which this repulsive force begins to dominate is about the radius of the 
spheres  shown  in  Figure  5.8.2.    This  Pauli  force  is  quantum  mechanical  in  origin,  and 
keeps  the  charges  from  collapsing  into  a  point  (i.e.,  it  keeps  a  negative  particle  and  a 
positive particle from sitting exactly on top of one another).    
 
Additionally,  the  motion  of  the  particles  is  damped  by  a  term  proportional  to  their 
velocity, allowing them to "settle down" into stable (or meta-stable) states. 
 

 

 
Figure  5.8.2  Four  charges  interacting  via  the  Coulomb  force,  a  repulsive  Pauli  force  at 
close distances, with dynamic damping. 
 
When  these  charges  are  allowed  to  evolve  from  the  initial  state,  the  first  thing  that 
happens  (very  quickly)  is  that  the  charges  pair  off  into  dipoles.  This  is  a  rapid  process 
because the Coulomb attraction between unbalanced charges is very large. This process is 
called "ionic binding", and is responsible for the inter-atomic forces in ordinary table salt, 
NaCl. After the dipoles form, there is still an interaction between neighboring dipoles, but 
this  is  a much weaker  interaction  because  the  electric  field  of  the  dipoles  falls  off much 
faster  than  that  of  a  single  charge.  This  is  because  the  net  charge  of  the  dipole  is  zero.  
When  two opposite charges are close  to one another,  their electric  fields “almost” cancel 
each other out.   
 
Although in principle the dipole-dipole interaction can be either repulsive or attractive, in 
practice  there  is  a  torque  that  rotates  the  dipoles  so  that  the  dipole-dipole  force  is 
attractive.   After a long time, this dipole-dipole attraction brings the two dipoles together 
in a bound state.  The force of attraction between two dipoles is termed a “van der Waals” 
force,  and  it  is  responsible  for  intermolecular  forces  that  bind  some  substances  together 
into a solid.   
 

Interactive Simulation 5.3:  Collection of Charges in Two Dimensions 
 
Figure  5.8.3  is  an  interactive  two-dimensional  ShockWave  display  that  shows  the  same 
dynamical situation as  in Figure 5.8.2 except  that we have  included a number of positive 
and  negative  charges,  and  we  have  eliminated  the  representation  of  the  field  so  that  we 

 

31

can  interact  with  this  simulation  in  real  time.      We  start  the  charges  at  rest  in  random 
positions  in  space,  and  then  let  them  evolve  according  to  the  forces  that  act  on  them 
(electrostatic  attraction/repulsion,  Pauli  repulsion  at  very  short  distances,  and  a  dynamic 
drag  term  proportional  to  velocity).    The  particles  will  eventually  end  up  in  a 
configuration  in which  the  net  force  on  any  given  particle  is  essentially  zero. As we  saw 
in  the  animation  in  Figure  5.8.3,  generally  the  individual  particles  first  pair  off  into 
dipoles  and  then  slowly  combine  into  larger  structures.  Rings  and  straight  lines  are  the 
most common configurations, but by clicking and dragging particles around, the user can 
coax them into more complex meta-stable formations. 
 
 

 
Figure  5.8.3  A  two  dimensional  interactive  simulation  of  a  collection  of  positive  and 
negative  charges  affected  by  the  Coulomb  force  and  the  Pauli  repulsive  force,  with 
dynamic damping. 
 
In  particular,  try  this  sequence  of  actions  with  the  display.    Start  it  and  wait  until  the 
simulation  has  evolved  to  the  point where  you  have  a  line  of  particles made  up  of  seven 
or  eight  particles.    Left  click  on  one  of  the  end  charges  of  this  line  and  drag  it  with  the 
mouse.    If you do  this  slowly enough,  the entire  line of chares will  follow along with  the 
charge  you  are  virtually  “touching”.    When  you  move  that  charge,  you  are  putting 
“energy” into the charge you have selected on one end of the line.  This “energy” is going 
into  moving  that  charge,  but  it  is  also  being  supplied  to  the  rest  of  the  charges  via  their 
electromagnetic  fields.    The  “energy”  that  the  charge  on  the  opposite  end  of  the  line 
receives  a  little while  after  you  start moving  the  first  charge  is  delivered  to  it  entirely  by 
energy flowing through space in the electromagnetic field, from the site where you create 
that energy.    
 
This  is  a microcosm  of  how  you  interact with  the world.   A  physical  object  lying  on  the 
floor  in  front  is  held  together  by  electrostatic  forces.   Quantum mechanics  keeps  it  from 
collapsing; electrostatic forces keep it from flying apart.   When you reach down and pick 
that  object  up  by  one  end,  energy  is  transferred  from  where  you  grasp  the  object  to  the 
rest of  it by energy flow  in  the electromagnetic field.     When you raise  it above  the floor, 
the  “tail  end”  of  the  object  never  “touches”  the  point  where  you  grasp  it.    All  of  the 
energy  provided  to  the  “tail  end”  of  the  object  to  move  it  upward  against  gravity  is 
provided  by  energy  flow  via  electromagnetic  fields,  through  the  complicated  web  of 
electromagnetic fields that hold the object together.

Interactive Simulation 5.4:  Collection of Charges in Three Dimensions 
 
Figure  5.8.4  is  an  interactive  three-dimensional ShockWave  display  that  shows  the  same 
dynamical  situation  as  in  Figure  5.8.3  except  that  we  are  looking  at  the  scene  in  three 
dimensions.    This  display  can  be  rotated  to  view  from  different  angles  by  right-clicking 
and  dragging  in  the  display.    We  start  the  charges  at  rest  in  random  positions  in  space, 
and  then  let  them  evolve  according  to  the  forces  that  act  on  them  (electrostatic 
attraction/repulsion,  Pauli  repulsion  at  very  short  distances,  and  a  dynamic  drag  term 
proportional  to  velocity).    Here  the  configurations  are  more  complex  because  of  the 
availability of the third dimension.  In particular, one can hit the “w” key to toggle a force 
that  pushes  the  charges  together  on  and  off.      Toggling  this  force  on  and  letting  the 
charges  settle  down  in  a  “clump”,  and  then  toggling  it off  to  let  them  expand,  allows  the 
construction  of  complicated  three  dimension  structures  that  are  “meta-stable”.      An 
example of one of these is given in Figure 5.8.4.

Interactive Simulation 5.5:  Collection of Dipoles in Two Dimensions 
 
Figure  5.8.5  shows  an  interactive  ShockWave  simulation  that  allows  one  to  interact  in 
two dimensions with a group of electric dipoles.

33

The  dipoles  are  created  with  random  positions  and  orientations,  with  all  the  electric 
dipole  vectors  in  the  plane  of  the  display.   As we  noted  above,  although  in  principle  the 
dipole-dipole  interaction can be either repulsive or attractive,  in practice  there  is a  torque 
that  rotates  the  dipoles  so  that  the  dipole-dipole  force  is  attractive.      In  the  ShockWave 
simulation  we  see  this  behavior—that  is,  the  dipoles  orient  themselves  so  as  to  attract, 
and then the attraction gathers them together into bound structures.      
 

Interactive Simulation 5.6:  Charged Particle Trap  
 
Figure 5.8.6 shows an interactive simulation of a charged particle trap.   
 

 
Figure 5.8.6 An interactive simulation of a particle trap. 

 

 
Particles  interact  as  before,  but  in  addition  each  particle  feels  a  force  that  pushes  them 
toward  the  origin,  regardless  of  the  sign  of  their  charge.   That  “trapping”  force  increases 
linearly  with  distance  from  the  origin.    The  charges  initially  are  randomly  distributed  in 
space,  but  as  time  increases  the  dynamic  damping  “cools”  the  particles  and  they 
“crystallize”  into  a  number  of  highly  symmetric  structures,  depending  on  the  number  of 
particles.    This  mimics  the  highly  ordered  structures  that  we  see  in  nature  (e.g., 
snowflakes). 
 
Exercise:  
 
Start  the  simulation.    The  simulation  initially  introduces  12  positive  charges  in  random 
positions (you can of course add more particles of either sign, but for the moment we deal 
with  only  the  initial  12).    About  half  the  time,  the  12  charges  will  settle  down  into  an 
equilibrium  in  which  there  is  a  charge  in  the  center  of  a  sphere  on  which  the  other  11 
charges  are  arranged.    The  other  half  of  the  time  all  12  particles will  be  arranged  on  the 
surface  of  a  sphere, with  no  charge  in  the middle.   Whichever  arrangement  you  initially 
find,  see  if  you  can  move  one  of  the  particles  into  position  so  that  you  get  to  the  other 
stable  configuration.    To  move  a  charge,  push  shift  and  left  click,  and  use  the  arrow 
buttons  to  move  it  up,  down,  left,  and  right.    You  may  have  to  select  several  different 
charges  in  turn  to  find  one  that  you  can  move  into  the  center,  if  you  initial  equilibrium 
does not have a center charge.   
 

 

34

Here  is  another  exercise.    Put  an  additional  8  positive  charges  into  the  display  (by 
pressing “p” eight  times)  for a  total of 20 charges.   By moving  charges  around  as  above, 
you  can  get  two  charges  in  inside  a  spherical  distribution  of  the  other  18.    Is  this  the 
lowest  number  of  charges  for  which  you  can  get  equilibrium  with  two  charges  inside?    
That  is,  can you do  this with 18  charges?   Note  that  if you push  the  “s” key you will get 
generate a surface based on the positions of the charges in the sphere, which will make its 
symmetries more apparent.   
 

Interactive Simulation 5.6:  Lattice 3D 
 
Lattice  3D,  shown  in  Figure  5.8.7,  simulates  the  interaction  of  charged  particles  in  three 
dimensions.  The  particles  interact  via  the  classical  Coulomb  force,  as  well  as  the 
repulsive  quantum-mechanical  Pauli  force, which  acts  at  close  distances  (accounting  for 
the  “collisions”  between  them). Additionally,  the motion  of  the  particles  is  damped  by  a 
term  proportional  to  their  velocity,  allowing  them  to  “settle  down”  into  stable  (or  meta-
stable) states. 
 

 

 
Figure  5.8.7  Lattice  3D  simulating  the  interaction  of  charged  particles  in  three 
dimensions. 
 
In  this simulation,  the proportionality of  the Coulomb and Pauli  forces has been adjusted 
to allow for lattice formation, as one might see in a crystal. The “preferred” stable state is 
a  rectangular  (cubic)  lattice,  although  other  formations  are  possible  depending  on  the 
number of particles and their initial positions. 
 
Selecting  a  particle  and  pressing  “f”  will  toggle  field  lines  illustrating  the  local  field 
around that particle. Performance varies depending on the number of particles / field lines 
in the simulation.  
 

Interactive Simulation 5.7:  2D Electrostatic Suspension Bridge 
 
To  connect  electrostatic  forces  to  one  more  example  of  the  real  world,  Figure  5.8.8  is  a 
simulation of a 2D “electrostatic suspension bridge.”  The bridge is created by attaching a 
series  of  positive  and  negatively  charged  particles  to  two  fixed  endpoints,  and  adding  a 
downward  gravitational  force.  The  tension  in  the  “bridge”  is  supplied  simply  by  the 

 

35

Coulomb  interaction  of  its  constituent  parts  and  the  Pauli  force  keeps  the  charges  from 
collapsing  in  on  each  other.  Initially,  the  bridge  only  sags  slightly  under  the  weight  of 
gravity.   However  the  user  can  introduce  additional  “neutral”  particles  (by  pressing  “o”) 
to  stress  the  bridge  more,  until  the  electrostatic  bonds  “break”  under  the  stress  and  the 
bridge collapses.   
 

 
Figure 5.8.8 A  ShockWave simulation of a 2D electrostatic suspension bridge. 
 

 

Interactive Simulation 5.8:  3D Electrostatic Suspension Bridge 
 
In the simulation shown in Figure 5.8.9, a 3D “electrostatic suspension bridge” is created 
by  attaching  a  lattice  of  positive  and  negatively  charged  particles  between  four  fixed 
corners,  and  adding  a  downward  gravitational  force.  The  tension  in  the  “bridge”  is 
supplied  simply  by  the  Coulomb  interaction  of  its  constituent  parts  and  the  Pauli  force 
keeping  them  from  collapsing  in  on  each  other.  Initially,  the  bridge  only  sags  slightly 
under  the weight of gravity, but what would happen  to  it under  a  rain  of massive  neutral 
particles? Press “o” to find out.

attract each other.   To  increase  the plate separation,  is  the external work done positive or 
negative?  What happens to the external work done in this process?

2.  How  does  the  stored  energy  change  if  the  potential  difference  across  a  capacitor  is 
tripled? 
 
3. Does  the  presence  of  a  dielectric  increase  or  decrease  the maximum  operating  voltage 
of a capacitor? Explain.

(a)  A  parallel-plate  capacitor  of  area  A  and  spacing  d  is  filled  with  three  dielectrics  as 
shown  in Figure 5.12.2. Each occupies 1/3 of the volume. What  is  the capacitance of  this 
system?  [Hint:  Consider  an  equivalent  system  to  be  three  parallel  capacitors,  and  justify 
this  assumption.]  Show  that  you  obtain  the  proper  limits  as  the  dielectric  constants 
approach unity, κi → 1.]

(b)  This  capacitor  is  now  filled  as  shown  in  Figure  5.12.3. What  is  its  capacitance? Use 
Gauss's  law  to  find  the  field  in  each  dielectric,  and  then  calculate  ∆V  across  the  entire 
capacitor.  Again,  check  your  answer  as  the  dielectric  constants  approach  unity,  κi →  1. 
Could you have assumed that this system is equivalent to three capacitors in series?

5.12.6  Force on the Plates of a Capacitor 
 
The plates of a parallel-plate capacitor have area A and carry  total charge ±Q  (see Figure 
5.12.6).  We would like to show that these plates attract  each other with a force given by  
F = Q2/(2εoA).

(a)  Calculate  the  total  force  on  the  left  plate  due  to  the  electric  field  of  the  right  plate, 
using Coulomb's Law.  Ignore fringing fields.   
 
(b) If you pull  the plates apart, against  their attraction, you are doing work and  that work 
goes directly  into creating additional electrostatic energy.   Calculate  the  force necessary

, to the 
increase  in  electrostatic  energy,  assuming  that  the  electric  energy  density  is εoE2/2,  and 
that the charge Q remains constant. 
 
(c) Using  this expression for  the force, show  that  the force per unit area (the electrostatic 
stress)  acting  on  either  capacitor  plate  is  given  by  εoE2/2.    This  result  is  true  for  a

(d) Atmospheric pressure is 14.7 lb/in2, or 101,341 N/m2.  How large would E have to be 
to  produce  this  force  per  unit  area?    [Ans:  151  MV/m.    Note  that  Van  de  Graff 
accelerators  can  reach  fields  of  100  MV/m  maximum  before  breakdown,  so  that 
electrostatic  stresses  are  on  the  same  order  as  atmospheric  pressures  in  this  extreme 
situation, but not much greater].
