Topic Introduction 
Today we go over some of the more advanced mathematical concepts we will need in the 
course, so that you see the mathematics before being introduced to the physics.  Maxwell’s 
equations as we will state them involve line and surface integrals over open and closed 
surfaces.  A closed surface has an inside and an outside, e.g. a basketball, and there is no two 
dimensional contour that “bounds” the surface.  In contrast, an open surface has no inside 
and outside, e.g. a flat infinitely thin plate, and there is a two dimensional contour that 
bounds the surface, e.g. the rim of the plate.  There are four Maxwell’s equations:

Equations (1) and (2) apply to closed surfaces.  Equations (3) and (4) apply to open surfaces, 
and the contour C represents the line contour that bounds those open surfaces. 
 
There is not need to understand the details of the electromagnetic application right now; we 
simply want to cover the mathematics in this problem solving session.
