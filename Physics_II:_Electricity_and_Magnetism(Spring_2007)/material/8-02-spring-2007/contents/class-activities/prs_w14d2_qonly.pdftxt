In the Figure above, the fringe at point P 
on the screen will be: 
 
1.  An interference maximum 
2.  An interference minimum

In the two 2-slit interference patterns 
above, the frequency of the wave on the 
left (A) is larger or smaller than the 
frequency of the wave on the right (B)? 
The slit spacing d is the same in both 
cases. 
 
1.  A larger than B 
2.  A smaller than B 
3.  Don’t have a clue

PRS33 

 
Coherent monochromatic plane waves 
impinge on two long narrow apertures 
(width a) that are separated by a distance 
d (d >> a).  The resulting pattern on a 
screen far away is shown above.   Which 
structure in the pattern above is due to 
the finite width a of the apertures? 
 

1.  The distantly-spaced zeroes of the 
envelope, as indicated by the length A 
above. 
2.  The closely-spaced zeroes of the 
rapidly varying fringes with length B 
above. 
3.  Don’t have a clue.

Coherent monochromatic plane waves 
impinge on two long narrow (width a) 
apertures separated by a distance d.  The 
resulting pattern on a screen far away is 
shown above.   For this arrangement: 
 

1.  The value of d/a is about 1/8 
2.  The value of d/a is about 1/4 
3.  The value of d/a is about 4 
4.  The value of d/a is about 8
