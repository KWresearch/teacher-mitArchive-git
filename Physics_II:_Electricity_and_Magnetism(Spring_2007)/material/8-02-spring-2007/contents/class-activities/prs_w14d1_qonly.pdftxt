A plane E&M wave is generated by 
shaking a sheet of charge up and down.  
At the time shown, the sheet is moving 
 
1. Up 
2. Down 
3. The sheet is not moving at this time 
4. Don't Have A Clue

At the time shown the charge on the top 
half of our ¼ wave antenna is positive and 
at its maximum value.  At this time:  
1.  The current across the spark gap is   
about zero.   
2.  The current across the spark gap is 
maximum and downward. 
3.  The current across the spark gap is 
maximum and upward.   
4.  Can’t tell from the information given.

When located as shown, our receiving 
antenna sees maximum power when 
oriented such that 
1.  Its straight portion is parallel to the 
straight portion of the transmitter  
2.  Its straight portion is perpendicular to 
the straight portion of the transmitter 
3.  Don’t have a clue.

As we move our receiving antenna around 
the spark gap transmitting antenna in the 
manner shown in the figure, we will see 
1. Increased received power at position B 
as compared to position A 
2. Decreased received power at position B 
as compared to position A 
3. No change in received power when the 
receiver is at position B as compared to 
position A    
4. Don’t have a clue.
