11.1  Mutual Inductance 
 
Suppose two coils are placed near each other, as shown in Figure 11.1.1

(cid:71)

The first coil has N1 turns and carries a current I1 which gives rise to a magnetic field 
. 
Since the two coils are close to each other, some of the magnetic field lines through coil 1 
will also pass  through coil 2. Let 
21Φ denote  the magnetic  flux  through one  turn of coil 2 
due  to  I1. Now, by varying  I1 with  time,  there will be an  induced  emf  associated with  the 
changing magnetic flux in the second coil:

We  shall  see  that  the mutual  inductance

In  a  similar  manner,  suppose  instead  there  is  a  current  I2  in  the  second  coil  and  it  is 
varying with time (Figure 11.1.2). Then the induced emf in coil 1 becomes

Solution: 
 
The mutual  inductance  can be  computed  as  follows. Using Eq.  (9.1.15) of Chapter 9, we 
see that the magnetic field at the center of the ring due to I1 in the outer coil is given by

The  result  shows  that  M  depends  only  on  the  geometrical  factors,

11.2  Self-Inductance 
 
Consider again a coil consisting of N turns and carrying current I in the counterclockwise 
direction,  as  shown  in  Figure  11.2.1.  If  the  current  is  steady,  then  the  magnetic  flux 
through the loop will remain constant. However, suppose the current I changes with time, 

2R ,  and  is 

1R  and 

 

4

then  according  to  Faraday’s  law,  an  induced  emf  will  arise  to  oppose  the  change.  The 
/
0
/dI dt > 0
induced  current  will  flow  clockwise  if 
,  and  counterclockwise  if 
dI dt < . 
The property of the loop in which its own magnetic field opposes any change in current is 
called  “self-inductance,”  and  the  emf  generated  is  called  the  self-induced  emf  or  back 
emf,  which  we  denote  as 
Lε .  All  current-carrying  loops  exhibit  this  property.  In 
particular,  an  inductor  is  a  circuit  element  (symbol 
)  which  has  a  large  self-
inductance.

Mathematically, the self-induced emf can be written as

Physically,  the  inductance  L  is  a  measure  of  an  inductor’s  “resistance”  to  the  change  of 
current; the larger the value of L, the lower the rate of change of current.

11.3  Energy Stored in Magnetic Fields 
 
Since an  inductor  in a circuit serves  to oppose any change  in  the current  through  it, work 
must be done by an external source such as a battery  in order  to establish a current  in  the 
inductor.  From  the  work-energy  theorem,  we  conclude  that  energy  can  be  stored  in  an 
inductor.  The  role  played  by  an  inductor  in  the  magnetic  case  is  analogous  to  that  of  a 
capacitor in the electric case. 
 
The power, or  rate  at which  an  external  emf

If  the  current  is  increasing  with 
 which  means  that  the  external 
,  then 
source is doing positive work to transfer energy to the inductor. Thus, the internal energy 
of  the  inductor  is  increased.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  current  is  decreasing  with 
BU
0
/dI dt <
0P <
.  In  this  case,  the  external  source  takes  energy  away  from 
, we  then  have 
the  inductor, causing  its  internal  energy  to go down. The  total work done by  the  external 
source to increase the current form zero to 
I  is then 
 
 
 
This is equal to the magnetic energy stored in the inductor:

We  comment  that  from  the  energy  perspective  there  is  an  important  distinction  between 
an inductor and a resistor. Whenever a current I goes through a resistor, energy flows into 
the  resistor  and  dissipates  in  the  form  of  heat  regardless  of  whether  I  is  steady  or  time-
dependent (recall that power dissipated in a resistor is 
). On the other hand,

Animation 11.1: Creating and Destroying Magnetic Energy 
 
Let’s consider the process involved in creating magnetic energy.  Figure 11.3.1 shows the 
process  by  which  an  external  agent(s)  creates  magnetic  energy.    Suppose  we  have  five 
rings  that  carry  a  number  of  free  positive  charges  that  are  not moving.  Since  there  is  no 
current, there is no magnetic field.  Now suppose a set of external agents come along (one 
for  each  charge)  and  simultaneously  spin  up  the  charges  counterclockwise  as  seen  from 
above,  at  the  same  time  and  at  the  same  rate,  in  a  manner  that  has  been  pre-arranged.   
Once  the  charges  on  the  rings  start  to  accelerate,  there  is  a  magnetic  field  in  the  space 
between the rings, mostly parallel to their common axis, which is stronger inside the rings 
than outside.  This is the solenoid configuration.   
 

 
Figure 11.3.1 Creating and destroying magnetic field energy. 

 

 
As  the  magnetic  flux  through  the  rings  grows,  Faraday’s  law  of  induction  tells  us  that 
there  is  an  electric  field  induced  by  the  time-changing  magnetic  field  that  is  circulating 
clockwise as seen  from above.     The  force on  the charges due  to  this electric  field  is  thus 
opposite 
the  rings  up 
to  spin 
trying 
the  external  agents  are 
the  direction 
(counterclockwise), and thus the agents have to do additional work to spin up the charges 
because of their charge.  This is the source of the energy that is appearing in the magnetic 
field between the rings — the work done by the agents against the “back emf.”   
 
Over  the  course  of  the  “create”  animation  associated  with  Figure  11.3.1,  the  agents 
moving  the  charges  to  a  higher  speed  against  the  induced  electric  field  are  continually 
doing  work.    The  electromagnetic  energy  that  they  are  creating  at  the  place  where  they 
are doing work (the path along which  the charges move) flows both  inward and outward.  
The  direction  of  the  flow  of  this  energy  is  shown  by  the  animated  texture  patterns  in 
Figure  11.3.1.   This  is  the  electromagnetic  energy  flow  that  increases  the  strength  of  the 
magnetic  field  in  the  space  between  the  rings  as  each  positive  charge  is  accelerated  to  a 
higher  and  higher  speed. When  the  external  agents  have  gotten  up  the  charges  to  a  pre-
determined speed, they stop the acceleration.  The charges then move at a constant speed, 
with  a  constant  field  inside  the  solenoid, and  zero  “induced”  electric  field,  in  accordance 
with Faraday’s law of induction.   
 
We also have an animation of the “destroy” process linked to Figure 11.3.1. This process 
proceeds  as  follows.    Our  set  of  external  agents  now  simultaneously  start  to  spin  down 
the moving charges (which are still moving counterclockwise as seen from above), at  the 

 

11

same time and at the same rate, in a manner that has been pre-arranged. Once the charges 
on  the  rings start  to decelerate,  the magnetic  field  in  the space between  the  rings starts  to 
decrease  in magnitude.   As  the magnetic  flux  through  the  rings decreases, Faraday’s  law 
tells  us  that  there  is  now  an  electric  field  induced  by  the  time-changing  magnetic  field 
that  is  circulating  counterclockwise  as  seen  from  above. The  force  on  the  charges  due  to 
this  electric  field  is  thus  in  the  same  direction  as  the  motion  of  the  charges.    In  this 
situation the agents have work done on them as they try to spin the charges down.   
 
Over  the course of  the “destroy” animation associated with Figure 11.3.1,  the  strength of 
the magnetic  field  decreases,  and  this  energy  flows  from  the  field  back  to  the  path  along 
which the charges move, and is now being provided to the agents trying to spin down the 
moving  charges.   The  energy provided  to  those agents  as  they destroy  the magnetic  field 
is  exactly  the  amount  of  energy  that  they  put  into  creating  the magnetic  field  in  the  first 
place, neglecting  radiative  losses  (such  losses are small  if we move  the charges at speeds 
small  compared  to  the  speed  of  light).    This  is  a  totally  reversible  process  if  we  neglect 
such losses.   That is, the amount of energy the agents put  into creating  the magnetic field 
is exactly returned to the agents as the field is destroyed.   
 
There  is  one  final  point  to  be made.   Whenever  electromagnetic  energy  is  being  created,

an  electric  charge  is  moving  (or  being  moved)  against  an  electric  field  (

Animation 11.2: Magnets and Conducting Rings 
 
In  the  example  of  Faraday’s  law  that  we  gave  above,  the  sense  of  the  electric  field 
associated with a time-changing magnetic field was always such as to try to resist change.  
We  consider  another  example  of  Faraday’s  law  that  illustrates  this  same  tendency  in  a 
different way.  
 

 
Figure  11.3.2  A perfectly  conducting  ring  falls on  the  axis of  a permanent magnet.   The 
induced  currents  and  the  resulting  magnetic  field  stresses  are  such  as  to  slow  the  fall  of 
the  ring.    If  the  ring  is  light  enough  (or  the magnet  strong  enough),  the  ring will  levitate 
above the magnet.   

 

 

12

 
In  Figure  11.3.2, we  show  a  permanent magnet  that  is  fixed  at  the  origin with  its  dipole 
moment  pointing  upward.  On  the  z-axis  above  the  magnet,  we  have  a  co-axial, 
conducting,  non-magnetic  ring with  radius  a,  inductance  L,  and  resistance  R.  The  center 
of  the conducting ring  is constrained  to move along  the vertical axis. The ring is released 
from  rest and  falls under gravity  toward  the stationary magnet. Eddy currents arise  in  the 
ring  because  of  the  changing  magnetic  flux  and  induced  electric  field  as  the  ring  falls 
toward the magnet, and the sense of these currents is to repel the ring when it is above the 
magnet.   
 
This  physical  situation  can  be  formulated  mathematically  in  terms  of  three  coupled 
ordinary differential  equations  for  the position of  the  ring,  its velocity,  and  the  current  in 
the ring.  We consider  in Figure 11.3.2  the particular situation where  the resistance of the 
ring (which in our model can have any value) is identically zero, and the mass of the ring 
is  small  enough  (or  the  field  of  the  magnet  is  large  enough)  so  that  the  ring  levitates 
above  the magnet. We  let  the  ring begin at  rest a distance 2a above  the magnet. The  ring 
begins  to  fall  under  gravity. When  the  ring  reaches  a  distance  of  about  a  above  the  ring, 
its  acceleration  slows  because  of  the  increasing  current  in  the  ring.  As  the  current 
increases,  energy  is  stored  in  the magnetic  field,  and  when  the  ring  comes  to  rest,  all  of 
the initial gravitational potential of the ring is stored in the magnetic field. That magnetic 
energy  is  then  returned  to  the  ring  as  it  “bounces”  and  returns  to  its  original  position  a 
distance  2a  above  the  magnet.  Because  there  is  no  dissipation  in  the  system  for  our 
particular choice of R in this example, this motion repeats indefinitely.  
 
What  are  the  important  points  to  be  learned  from  this  animation?    Initially,  all  the  free 
energy  in  this  situation  is  stored  in  the  gravitational  potential  energy  of  the  ring.   As  the 
ring begins to fall, that gravitational energy begins to appear as kinetic energy in the ring. 
It  also  begins  to  appear  as  energy  stored  in  the  magnetic  field.    The  compressed  field 
below  the  ring enables  the  transmission of an upward  force  to  the moving  ring as well as 
a downward force to the magnet.  But that compression also stores energy in the magnetic 
field.    It  is  plausible  to  argue  based  on  the  animation  that  the  kinetic  energy  of  the 
downwardly  moving  ring  is  decreasing  as  more  and  more  energy  is  stored  in  the 
magnetostatic field, and conversely when the ring is rising.  
 
Figure  11.3.3  shows  a  more  realistic  case  in  which  the  resistance  of  the  ring  is  finite.  
Now  energy  is  not  conserved,  and  the  ring  eventually  falls  past  the  magnet.    When  it 
passes  the  magnet,  the  sense  of  the  induced  electric  field  and  thus  of  the  eddy  currents 
reverses, and the ring is now attracted to the magnet above it, which again retards its fall.   
 
There  are  many  other  examples  of  the  falling  ring  and  stationary  magnet,  or  falling 
magnet and stationary ring, given in the animations at this link.  All of them show that the 
effect of the electric field associated with a time-changing magnetic field is to try to keep 
things  the  same.      In  the  limiting  case  of  zero  resistance,  it  can  in  fact  achieve  this  goal, 
e.g.  in Figure 11.3.2  the magnetic  flux  through  the  ring never changes over  the course of 
the motion.

11.4  RL Circuits 
 
11.4.1  Self-Inductance and the Modified Kirchhoff's Loop Rule 
 
The  addition  of  time-changing  magnetic  fields  to  simple  circuits  means  that  the  closed 
line  integral of  the  electric  field  around  a  circuit  is no  longer  zero.    Instead, we have,  for 
any open surface 
 
 
 
Any circuit where the current changes with time will have time-changing magnetic fields, 
and therefore induced electric fields.  How do we solve simple circuits taking such effects 
into  account?    We  discuss  here  a  consistent  way  to  understand  the  consequences  of 
introducing time-changing magnetic fields into circuit theory -- that is, inductance.   
 
As  soon  as  we  introduce  time-changing magnetic  fields,  the  electric  potential  difference 
between  two  points  in  our  circuit  is  no  longer  well-defined,  because  when  the  line 
integral  of  the  electric  field  around  a  closed  loop  is  nonzero,  the  potential  difference 
between two points, say a and b, is no longer independent of the path taken to get from a 
to b.   That  is,  the electric field  is no  longer a conservative field, and  the electric potential 
(cid:71)
is  no  longer  an  appropriate  concept,  since  we  can  no  longer  write  E
as  the  negative 
gradient  of  a  scalar  potential.  However,  we  can  still  write  down  in  a  straightforward 
fashion the equation that determines the behavior of a circuit.

Figure 11.4.1 One-loop inductor circuit

To show how to do this, consider the circuit shown in Figure 11.4.1. We have a battery, a 
resistor, a switch S that is closed at t = 0, and a “one-loop inductor.”  It will become clear 
what  the  consequences  of  this  “inductance”  are  as  we  proceed.      For  t  >  0,  current  will 
flow  in  the  direction  shown  (from  the  positive  terminal  of  the  battery  to  the  negative,  as 
usual).  What is the equation that governs the behavior of our current  ( )
 for t > 0?  
I t
    
To investigate this, apply Faraday's law to the open surface bounded by our circuit, where 
(cid:71)

A
we  take  d
 to  be  out  of  the  page,  and  d
(counter-clockwise).    First,  what  is  the  integral  of  the  electric  field  around  this  circuit?   
There is an electric field in the battery, directed from the positive terminal to the negative 
terminal, and when we go through the battery in the direction of  d s(cid:71)  that we have chosen, 
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
E s
we are moving against  that electric  field,  so  that 
.   Thus  the contribution of  the

battery to our integral is  ε− . Then, there is an electric field in the resistor, in the direction 
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
d⋅E s
of  the  current,  so  when  we  move  through  the  resistor  in  that  direction, 
 is  greater 
than  zero,  and  that  contribution  to  our  integral  is 
.  What  about  when  we  move 
I R+
through our one-loop  inductor?   There  is no  electric  field  in  this  loop  if  the  resistance of 
the wire making up the loop is zero. Thus, going around the closed loop clockwise against 
the current, we have  
 
 
 
BΦ  through  our  open  surface?    First  of  all,  we  arrange 
Now,  what  is  the  magnetic  flux 
the geometry so  that  the part of  the circuit which  includes  the battery,  the switch, and  the 
resistor makes  only  a  small  contribution  to 
BΦ  as  compared  to  the  (much  larger  in  area) 
part  of  the  open  surface  which  includes  our  one-loop  inductor.    Second,  we  know  that 
 is  positive  in  that  part  of  the  surface,  because  current  flowing  counterclockwise will

The  modified  rule  for  inductors  may  be  obtained  as  follows:  The  polarity  of  the  self-
induced emf  is  such as  to oppose  the change  in current,  in accord with Lenz’s  law.  If  the

Use of  this modified Kirchhoff’s  rule will give  the correct equations  for circuit problems 
that  contain  inductors.   However, keep  in mind  that  it  is misleading  at best, and at  some 
level wrong  in  terms of  the physics. Again, we emphasize  that Kirchhoff's  loop  rule was 
(cid:71)
originally  based  on  the  fact  that  the  line  integral  of  E
around  a  closed  loop  was  zero.

inductor simply acts as a conducting wire connecting two parts of the circuit.

created from the discharging process generates magnetic energy which then gets stored in 
the  inductor.  In  the  absence  of  resistance,  the  total  energy  is  transformed  back  and  forth 
between the electric energy in the capacitor and the magnetic energy in the inductor. This 
phenomenon is called electromagnetic oscillation.

11.6  The RLC Series Circuit

capacitor, as shown in Figure 11.6.1.

The  capacitor  is  initially  charged  to 
.  After  the  switch  is  closed  current  will  begin  to 
0Q
flow.  However,  unlike  the  LC  circuit  energy  will  be  dissipated  through  the  resistor.  The 
rate at which energy is dissipated is 
 
 
 
where  the negative sign on  the right-hand side implies  that  the  total energy  is decreasing. 
After  substituting Eq.  (11.5.2)  for  the  left-hand side of  the above equation, we obtain  the 
following differential equation: 
 
 
  
Again, by our sign convention where current  is equal  to  the  rate of decrease of charge  in 
the  capacitor  plates, 
.  Dividing  both  sides  by  I,  the  above  equation  can  be

When  the  system  is  critically  damped, 
general solution is  
 
 
 
where  Q1  and  Q2  are  constants  which  can  be  determined  from  the  initial  conditions.  In 
this case one may show that the energy of the system decays most rapidly with time. The

11.8.1  Quality Factor 
 
When  the  resistance  is  small,  the  system  is  underdamped,  and  the  charge  oscillates with 
decaying amplitude 
. The “quality” of this underdamped oscillation is measured by 
t
Q e γ−

the so-called “quality factor,” Q (not to be confused with charge.) The larger the value of 
Q, the less the damping and the higher the quality. Mathematically, Q is defined as

Let’s  now  consider  a  more  general  case  of  stress  (pressure  or  tension)  transmitted  by 
fields.  In Figure 11.9.3, we  show  an  imaginary  closed  surface  (an  imaginary box) placed 
in a magnetic field.   If we look at the face on the left side of this imaginary box, the field 
on  that  face  is  perpendicular  to  the  outward  normal  to  that  face.  Using  the  result 
illustrated  in  Figure  11.9.2,  the  field  on  that  face  transmits  a  pressure  perpendicular  to 
itself.    In  this  case,  this  is  a  push  to  the  right.      Similarly,  if  we  look  at  the  face  on  the 
right  side  of  this  imaginary  box,  the  field  on  that  face  is  perpendicular  to  the  outward 
normal  to  that  face,  the  field  on  that  face  transmits  a  pressure  perpendicular  to  itself.    In 
this case, this is a push to the left.   
 

 
Figure  11.9.3  An  imaginary  box  in  a  magnetic  field  (blue  vectors).    The  short  vectors 
indicate  the  directions  of  stresses  transmitted  by  the  field,  either  pressures  (on  the  left  or 
right faces of the box) or tensions (on the top and bottom faces of the box). 
 
If  we  want  to  know  the  total  electromagnetic  force  transmitted  to  the  interior  of  this 
imaginary  box  in  the  left-right  direction,  we  add  these  two  transmitted  stresses.  If  the 
electric or magnetic  field  is homogeneous,  this  total  electromagnetic  force  transmitted  to 

 

34

the  interior  of  the  box  in  the  left-right  direction  is  a  push  to  the  left  and  an  equal  but 
opposite push to the right, and the transmitted force adds up to zero.    
 
 
In contrast, if the right side of this imaginary box is sitting inside a long vertical solenoid, 
for which  the magnetic field  is vertical and constant, and  the  left side  is sitting outside of 
that solenoid, where the magnetic field is zero, then there is a net push to the left, and we 
say  that  the magnetic  field  exerts  a  outward  pressure  on  the walls  of  the  solenoid.     We 
can  deduce  this  by  simply  looking  at  the  magnetic  field  topology.    At  sufficiently  high 
magnetic field, such forces will cause the walls of a solenoid to explode outward.   
 
Similarly,  if  we  look  at  the  top  face  of  the  imaginary  box  in  Figure  11.9.3,  the  field  on 
that face is parallel to the outward normal to that face, and one may show that the field on 
that  face  transmits  a  tension  along  itself  across  that  face.    In  this  case,  this  is  an  upward 
pull,  just  as  if  we  had  attached  a  string  under  tension  to  that  face,  pulling  upward.  (The 
actual determination of  the direction of  the force  requires an advance  treatment using  the 
Maxwell  stress  tensor.)    On  the  other  hand,  if  we  look  at  the  bottom  face  of  this 
imaginary  box,  the  field  on  that  face  is  anti-parallel  to  the  outward  normal  to  that  face, 
and  Faraday  would  again  have  said  that  the  field  on  that  face  transmits  a  tension  along 
itself.  In this case, this is a downward pull, just as if we had attached a string to that face, 
pulling  downward.    Note  that  this  is  a  pull  parallel  to  the  outward  surface  normal, 
whether  the  field  is  into  the  surface  or  out  of  the  surface,  since  the  pressures  or  tensions 
are proportional to the squares of the field magnitudes.   
 
If  we  want  to  know  the  total  electromagnetic  force  transmitted  to  the  interior  of  this 
imaginary  box  in  the  up-down  direction,  we  add  these  two  transmitted  stresses.  If  the 
magnetic field is homogeneous, this total electromagnetic force transmitted to the interior 
of  the  box  in  the  up-down  direction  is  a  pull  upward  plus  an  equal  and  opposite  pull 
downward, and adds to zero.    
 
The  magnitude  of  these  pressures  and  tensions  on  the  various  faces  of  the  imaginary 
surface  in  Figure  11.9.3  is  given  by 
/ 2B µ ,  as  shown  in  Eq.  (11.9.7).  Our  discussion

Pressures and Tensions Transmitted by Magnetic Fields 

 
Electromagnetic  fields  are  mediators  of  the  interactions  between  material  objects.    The 
fields  transmit  stresses  through  space.   A magnetic    field  transmits  a  tension  along  itself 
and  a  pressure  perpendicular  to  itself.    The  magnitude  of  the  tension  or  pressure 
transmitted by a magnetic  field  is given by

Animation 11.3: A Charged Particle in a Time-Varying Magnetic Field 
 
As an example of  the  stresses  transmitted by magnetic  fields, consider a moving positive 
point  charge  at  the  origin  in  a  rapidly  changing  time-dependent  external  field.  This 
external field is uniform in space but varies in time according to the equation

We  assume  that  the  variation  of  this  field  is  so  rapid  that  the  charge  moves  only  a 
negligible  distance  in  one  period  T.    Figure  11.9.4  shows  two  frames  of  an  animation  of 
the total magnetic field configuration for this situation.  Figure 11.9.4(a) is at t = 0, when 
the  vertical  magnetic  field  is  zero,  and  we  see  only  the  magnetic  field  of  the  moving 
charge  (the  charge  is  moving  out  of  the  page,  so  the  field  circulates  clockwise).    Frame 
11.9.4(b)  is at a quarter period  later, when  the vertically downward magnetic  field  is at a 
maximum.  To the left of the charge, where the field of the charge is in the same direction 
as  the  external magnetic  field  (downward),  the magnetic  field  is  enhanced.    To  the  right 
of the charge, where the field of the charge is opposite that of the external magnetic field, 
the magnetic field is reduced (and is zero at one point to the right of the charge).

Figure 11.9.4 Two frames of an animation of the magnetic field around a positive charge 
moving  out  of  the  page  in  a  time-changing  magnetic  field  that  points  downward.    The 
blue vector is the magnetic field and the white vector is the force on the point charge. 
 
We  interpret  the  field  configuration  in  Figure  11.9.4(b)  as  indicating  a  net  force  to  the 
right  on  the  moving  charge.    This  occurs  because  the  pressure  of  the  magnetic  field  is 
much  higher  on  the  left  as  compared  to  the  right.    Note  that  if  the  charge  had  been 
moving  into  the  page  instead  of  out  of  the  page,  the  force  would  have  been  to  the  left, 
because  the  magnetic  pressure  would  have  been  higher  on  the  right.  The  animation  of 
Figure  11.9.4  shows  dramatically  the  inflow  of  energy  into  the  neighborhood  of  the 
charge  as  the  external  magnetic  field  grows,  with  a  resulting  build-up  of  stress  that 
transmits a sideways force to the moving positive charge.

We  can  estimate  the magnitude  of  the  force  on  the moving  charge  in Figure  11.9.4(b)  as

magnetic  force  on  a moving  charge  is  transverse  to  the  velocity  of  the  charge  and  to  the 
direction of  the background  field.   This  is because of  the  side of  the charge on which  the 
total magnetic pressure  is  the highest.    It  is  this pressure  that  causes  the deflection of  the 
charge.   
 
 
11.10 Problem-Solving Strategies 
 
 
11.10.1  Calculating Self-Inductance 
 
The self-inductance L of an inductor can be calculated using the following steps: 
 
1. Assume a steady current I for the inductor, which may be a conducting loop, a solenoid, 
a toroid, or coaxial cables.   
 
2. Choose an appropriate cross section S and compute the magnetic flux through S using

11.10.2  Circuits containing inductors 
 
Three  types  of  single-loop  circuits  were  examined  in  this  chapter:  RL,  LC  and  RLC.  To 
set  up  the  differential  equation  for  a  circuit,  we  apply  the  Kirchhoff’s  loop  and  junction 
rules,  as  we  did  in  Chpater  7  for  the  RC  circuits.  For  circuits  that  contain  inductors,  the 
corresponding modified Kirchhoff’s rule is schematically shown below.

behavior of the circuit where the currents have reached their steady state and 
d I d t = . 
In  this  limit,  the  inductor  acts  as  a  short  circuit  and  can  simply  be  replaced  by  an  ideal 
wire.

A toroid consists of N turns and has a rectangular cross section, with inner radius a, outer 
radius  b  and  height  h  (see  Figure  11.2.3).  Find  the  total  magnetic  energy  stored  in  the 
toroid.

11.12  Conceptual Questions 
 
1.  How  would  you  shape  a  wire  of  fixed  length  to  obtain  the  greatest  and  the  smallest 
inductance?  
 
2.  If  the  wire  of  a  tightly  wound  solenoid  is  unwound  and  made  into  another  tightly 
wound  solenoid with  a diameter 3  times  that of  the original one, by what  factor does  the 
inductance change? 
 
3. What analogies can you draw between an ideal solenoid and a parallel-plate capacitor? 
 
4. In  the RL circuit show in Figure 11.12.1, can  the self-induced emf ever be greater  than 
the emf supplied by the battery?

between two coils carrying currents in the same (opposite) direction.  
 
6. Explain why  the LC oscillation continues even after  the capacitor has been completely 
discharged. 
 
7. Explain physically why the time constant

is in the same direction as ω. 
 
(d) What is the magnetic field created when the cylinders are spinning at angular velocity 
(cid:71)
ω?    You  should  give magnitude  and  direction  of  B
 in  each  of  the  three  regions:  r  <  a,
