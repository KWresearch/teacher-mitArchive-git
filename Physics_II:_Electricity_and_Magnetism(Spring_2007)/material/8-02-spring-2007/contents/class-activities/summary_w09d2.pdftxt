Topic Introduction 

Today we continue our discussion of induction (Faraday’s Law) and get a hands-on feeling 
for it in experiment #5.We introduce elements that take advantage of Faraday’s Law – 
inductors.

 We will then do a problem solving session on Faraday’s Law (typically we would do this on 
Friday, but since Friday is CPW we are doing it today so that Friday we can entertain the pre-
frosh).

Recall:  Faraday’s Law says that a changing magnetic flux generates an EMF 
Lenz’s Law says that the direction of that EMF is so as to oppose the change in magnetic 
flux.

Experiment 5:  Faraday’s Law of Induction 
Preparation:  Read pre-lab and answer pre-lab questions 

In this lab you will have a chance to measure and even feel Faraday’s law in action.  The lab 
basically consists of moving a loop of wire over a magnetic dipole.  You will (we hope) 
develop an intuition for how currents flow through the wire loop as it moves in the magnetic 
field of the dipole, and for the direction of the resultant force on the loop.

Since  magnetic  fields  are  typically  generated  by  currents,  Faraday’s  law  implies  that 
changing currents also generate EMFs.  This is the idea of mutual inductance:  given any two 
circuits,  a  changing  current  in  one  will  induce  an  EMF  in  the  other,  or,  mathematically, 
ε2  = −M d I1  d t  , where M is the mutual inductance of the two circuits.  How does this work? 
The  current  in  loop  1  produces  a  magnetic  field  (and  hence  flux)  through  loop  2.    If  that 
current changes  in  time,  the  flux  through 2 changes  in  time, creating an EMF  in  loop 2.   The 
mutual  inductance,  M,  depends  on  geometry,  both  on  how  well  the  current  in  the  first  loop 
can  create  a  magnetic  field  and  on  how  much  magnetic  flux  through  the  second  loop  that 
magnetic field will create. 

Transformers 

A major application of mutual inductance is the transformer, which 
allows  the  easy  modification  of  the  voltage  of  AC  (alternating 
current) signals.  At left is the schematic of a step up transformer. 
An  input  voltage  VBP B  on  the  primary  coil  creates  an  oscillating 
magnetic field, which is “steered” through the iron core (recall that 
ferromagnets  like  iron  act  like  wires  for  magnetic  fields)  and 
through  the  secondary  coils,  which  induces  an  EMF  in  them.    In 
the  ideal  case,  the  amount  of  flux  generated  and  received  is 
proportional to the number of turns in each coil.  Hence the ratio of 
the output  to  input voltage  is  the same as  the ratio of  the number of  turns  in  the secondary  to 
the number of  turns  in  the primary.   As pictured we have more  turns  in  the secondary, hence 
this is a “step up transformer,” with a larger output voltage than input.   

The  ease  of  creating  transformers  is  a  strong  argument  for  using AC  rather  than DC  power. 
Why?    Before  sending  power  across  transmission  lines,  voltage  is  stepped  way  up  (to 
240,000 V),  leading  to  smaller  currents  and  losses  in  the  lines.    The  voltage  is  then  stepped 
down to 240 V before going into your home. 

Self Inductance 
Self inductance is very similar to mutual inductance, obeying a similar equation: ε= − L d I   ,
d t  
and  the  same  concept:    when  a  circuit  has  a  current  in  it,  it  creates  a  magnetic  field,  and 
hence  a  flux,  through  itself.    If  that  current  changes,  then  the  flux will  change  and  hence  an 
EMF will be  induced  in  the circuit.   The action of  that EMF will be  to oppose  the change  in 
current  (if  the  current  is  decreasing  it  will  try  to  make  it  bigger,  if  increasing  it  will  try  to 
make it smaller).  For this reason, we often refer to the induced EMF as the “back EMF.” 

To calculate the self inductance (or inductance, for short) of an object, imagine that a current 
I  flows  through  it,  and  determine  how  much  magnetic  field  and  hence  flux Φ   that  makes 
BBB
through the object.  The self inductance is then  L = Φ B  I . 

An  inductor  is a circuit element whose main characteristic  is  its  inductance, L.  It  is drawn as 
a  coil 
  in  circuit  diagrams.    The  strong  resemblance  to  a  solenoid  is  intentional  – 
solenoids make very good inductors both because of their ability to make a strong field inside

themselves,  and  also  because  the  field  they  produce  is  fairly  well  contained,  and  hence 
doesn’t produce much flux (and induce EMFs) in other, nearby circuits. 

The  role  of  an  inductor  is  to  oppose  changing  currents.    At  steady  state,  in  a  DC  circuit,  an 
inductor  is off –  it  induces no EMF  as  long  as  the  current  through  it  is  constant.   As  soon  as 
you  try  to change  the current  through an  inductor  though,  it will  fight back.    In  this  sense an 
inductor is the opposite of a capacitor.  If a capacitor is placed in a steady state current it will 
eventually  fill  up  and  “open”  the  circuit, whereas  an  inductor  looks  like  a  short  in  this  case. 
On the other hand, when starting from its uncharged state, a capacitor looks like a short when 
you  first  try  to  move  current  through  it,  while  an  inductor  looks  like  an  open  circuit,  as  it 
prevents the change (from no current to some current).
