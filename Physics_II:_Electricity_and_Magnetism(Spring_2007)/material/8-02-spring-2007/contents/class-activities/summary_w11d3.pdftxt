Topic Introduction 

In the last couple of classes you had the chance to hear about and then investigate the 
behavior of RC and RL circuits.  In today’s problem solving session you will practice solving 
analytic and answering short conceptual questions about these circuits. 

RC & RL Circuits 

A simple RC circuit is shown at right.  When the switch is closed, current will flow in the 
circuit, but as time goes on this current will decrease.  We can 
write down the differential equation for current flow by writing 
∆V 
 for a
= Q C
down Kirchhoff’s loop rules, recalling that 
capacitor and that the charge Q on the capacitor is related to 
current flowing in the circuit by  I  = ±dQ  dt , where the sign 
depends on whether the current is flowing into the positively 
charged plate (+) or the negatively charged plate (-).  The solution to 
this differential equation shows that the current decreases 
exponentially from its initial value while the potential on the 
capacitor grows exponentially to its final value.  The rate at which 
this change happens is dictated by the “time constant” τ, which for 
this circuit is given by τ= RC . 

Decay Down 

If we replace the capacitor with an inductor we find a similar but 
opposite result.  Now the current starts at zero and “decays” upward 
to a constant value, now with a time constant τ = L/R (a big 
inductance slows down the circuit as it is more effective at opposing 
changes, but now a big resistance reduces the size of the current and 
hence changes in the current that the inductor will see, and thus 
decreases the time constant – speeds things up). 

“Decay” Up 

Interestingly, in RC & RL circuits any value that you could ask about (current, potential drop 
across the resistor, across the capacitor, …) “decays” exponentially (either down or up).  You 
should be able to determine which of the two plots at right a value will follow just by 
thinking about it.  This reasoning forms the basis of most conceptual questions about DC 
circuits.
