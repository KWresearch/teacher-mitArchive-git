Topic Introduction 

 
Today we begin a major new topic in the course – magnetism.  In some ways magnetic fields 
are very similar to electric fields:  they are generated by and exert forces on electric charges.  
There are a number of differences though.  First of all, magnetic fields only interact with (are 
created by and exert forces on) charges that are moving.   Secondly, the simplest magnetic 
objects are not monopoles (like a point charge) but are instead dipoles.   
 
This week we will focus on the creation of magnetic fields.  The presentation is analogous to 
our discussion of charges creating electric fields.  We first describe the magnetic field 
generated by a single charge and then proceed to collections of moving charges (currents), 
the fields from which we will calculate using superposition – just like for continuous charge 
distributions. 
 
Dipole Fields 
We will begin the class by noting that the magnetic fields you are most familiar with, those 
generated by bar magnets and by the Earth, act like magnetic dipoles.  Magnetic dipoles 
create magnetic fields identical in shape to the electric fields generated by electric dipoles.  
We even describe them in the same way, saying that they consist of a North pole (+) and a 
South pole (-) some distance apart, and that magnetic field lines flow from the North pole to 
the South pole.  Despite these similarities, magnetic dipoles are different from electric 
dipoles, in that if you cut an electric dipole in half you will find a positive charge and a 
negative charge, while if you cut a magnetic dipole in half you will be left with two new 
magnetic dipoles.  There is no such thing as an isolated “North magnetic charge” (a magnetic 
monopole). 
 
Field from a Single Moving Charge 
Next we turn to the creation of magnetic fields.  Just as a single electric charge creates an 
electric field which is proportional to charge q and falls off as r-2, a single moving electric 
charge additionally creates a magnetic field given by

Note the similarity to Coulomb’s law for the electric field – the field is proportional to the 
charge q, obeys an inverse square law in r, and depends on a constant, the permeability of 
free space µ0 = 4π x 10-7 T m/A.  The difference is that the field no longer points along  but 
ˆr
is instead perpendicular to it (because of the cross product).   
 
If you haven’t worked with cross products in a while, you should read the vector analysis 
review module.  Rapid calculation of at least the direction of cross-products will dominate 
the rest of the course so you need to understand what they mean and how to compute them.

Field from a Current:  Biot-Savart Law

This is the Biot-Savart formula, and, like the differential form of Coulomb’s Law, provides a 
generic method for calculating fields – here magnetic fields generated by currents.  The ds in 
this formula is a small length of the wire carrying the current I, so that I ds plays the same 
role that dq did when we calculated electric fields from continuous charge distributions.  To 
find the total magnetic field at some point in space you integrate over the current distribution 
(e.g. along the length of the wire), adding up the field generated by each little part of it ds.

Right Hand Rules 
Because of the cross product in the Biot-Savart Law, the direction of 
the resulting magnetic field is not as simple as when we were working 
with electric fields.  In order to quickly see what direction the field 
will be in, or what direction the force on a moving particle will be in, 
we can use a “Right Hand Rule.”  At times it seems that everyone has 
their own, unique, right hand rule.  Certainly there are a number of 
them out there, and you should feel free to use whichever allow you to 
get the correct answer.  Here I describe the three that I use (including 
one we won’t come to until next week). 
 
The important thing to remember is that cross-products yield a result which is 
perpendicular to both of the input vectors.  The only open question is in which of 
the two perpendicular directions will the result point (e.g. if the vectors are in the 
floor does their cross product point up or down?).  Using your RIGHT hand: 
 
1)  For a generic cross-product (C = AxB): open your hand perfectly flat.  Put your 
thumb along A and your fingers along B.  Your palm points along C. 
 
2)  For determining the direction of the magnetic field generated by a current:  
fields wrap around currents the same direction that your fingers wrap around your 
thumb.  At any point the field points tangent to the circle your fingers will make as you 
twist your hand keeping your thumb along the current. 
 
3)  For determining the direction of the dipole moment of a coil of wire:  wrap your 
fingers in the direction of current.  Your thumb points in the direction of the North pole 
of the dipole (in the direction of the dipole moment µ of the coil).
