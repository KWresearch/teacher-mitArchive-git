Faraday’s Law: Loop 

 
 

 

 

 

 
A coil moves up from underneath a 
magnet with its north pole pointing 
upward.   The current in the coil and the 
force on the coil: 
 
1.  Current clockwise; force up 
2.  Current counterclockwise; force up  
3.  Current clockwise; force down 
4.  Current counterclockwise; force down

Faraday’s Law: Rails 
 

 

 
A conducting rod moves along 
conducting rails in a magnetic field 
which is out of the page.  The current in 
the rod and the force on the rod are: 
 

1. Current up and force to left 
2. Current down and force to left   
3. Current up and force to right 
4. Current down and force to right

Faraday’s Law: Loop 

 
 

 
 

 
 
A circuit in the form of a rectangular 
piece of wire is pulled away from a long 
wire carrying current I in the direction 
shown in the sketch.  The induced 
current in the rectangular circuit is 
 
1. Clockwise 
2. Counterclockwise   
3. Neither, the current is zero

A square coil rotates in a magnetic field 
directed to the right.  At the time shown, 
the current in the square, when looking 
down from the top of the square loop, 
will be 
 
1. Counterclockwise. 
2. Clockwise

Loop in Uniform Field 
 
Bout 

 

v 
A rectangular wire loop is pulled thru a 
uniform magnetic field penetrating its top 
half, as shown.  The induced current and 
the force and torque on the loop are: 
 
1. Current CW, Force Left, No Torque 
 
2. Current CW, No Force, Torque 
Rotates CCW 
 
3. Current CCW, Force Left, No Torque 
 
4. Current CCW, No Force, Torque 
Rotates CCW 
 
5. No current, force or torque
