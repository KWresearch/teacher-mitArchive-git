At this time,  
1. I is increasing and Q is increasing 
2. I is increasing and Q is decreasing 
3. I is decreasing and Q is increasing 
4. I is decreasing and Q is decreasing

At t = 0, a fully charged capacitor begins 
discharging through an inductor and a 
resistor.  The plot shows the time behavior of 
the electric and magnetic energies in the 
circuit, and their sum.  The total energy in 
the circuit decreases most rapidly when 
 

1. The absolute value of the current is a 
maximum 
2. The current is zero 
3. Neither, since the current decreases at an 
exponential rate. 
4. Don’t have a clue
