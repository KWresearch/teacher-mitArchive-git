When a current flows in a wire of length 
L and cross sectional area A, the 
resistance of the wire is 
 

1.  Proportional to A and inversely 
proportional to L.   
2.  Proportional to both A and  L.   
3.  Proportional to L and inversely 
proportional to A.   
4.  Inversely proportional to both L and 
A

Bulbs and Batteries 
 
An ideal battery is hooked 
to a light bulb with wires. 
A second identical light 
bulb is connected in 
parallel to the first light 
bulb. After the second 
light bulb is connected, the 
current from the battery 
compared to when only 
one bulb was connected.   
 

1.  Is Higher
