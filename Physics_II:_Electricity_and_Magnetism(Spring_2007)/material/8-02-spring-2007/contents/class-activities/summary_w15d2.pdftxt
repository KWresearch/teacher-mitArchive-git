Final Exam Information 

The FINAL EXAM will be held Monday May 21 9 am to 12 pm. Location: Johnson 
Track (upstairs). 

Material Covered & Exam Format: 
1. 	 All material covered in the course through the end of the course (through 

interference) will be fair game for the final exam. 

2. 	 The exam will be slightly less than twice the length of your first three exams, with 
analytic and conceptual questions. 
3.	 This will be a closed book exam. There will be a formula sheet given on the 
exam. You should have plenty of time to finish the exam in the three hours 
allotted. 

What We Expect From You In Particular On The Final 

(1)  An understanding of Maxwell’s equations, including Maxwell’s addition to Ampere’s 
Law  (displacement  current).    You  should  be  able  to  produce  and  identify  each  of 
Maxwell’s  equations,  as  well  as  give  brief  explanations  of  the  meaning  and  use  of 
each  of  them  (don’t  be  surprised  by  a  question  like  “State  each  of  Maxwell’s 
equations and briefly explain their meaning and typical use.”)  In particular: 
(a)  The ability to use Gauss’s Law to obtain electric fields from highly symmetric 
distributions of charge. 
(b)  An ability to use Ampere’s Law to obtain magnetic fields in magnetostatics for highly 
symmetric distributions of current. 
(c)  An ability to do analytic problems related to the displacement current. That is, you 
should be able to calculate the magnetic field anywhere inside a charging capacitor, 
and so on. 
(d)  An understanding of how to use Faraday’s Law in problems involving the generation 
of induced EMFs. You should be able to formulate quantitative answers to questions 
about energy considerations in Faraday’s Law problems, e.g. the power going into 
ohmic dissipation comes from the decreasing kinetic energy of a rolling rod, etc.  
(2)  An understanding of the concept of electric field and electric potential difference, an 
ability to calculate those in specific circumstances (e.g. given V(x,y,z) find E(x,y,z), 
or given E(x,y,z) find V(x,y,z), and so on). This includes the ability to calculate 
capacitance for highly symmetric situations.  
(3)  An understanding of the concept of an electric dipole and the forces and torques on 
such a dipole in an external electric field.  
(4)  An ability to use the Biot-Savart Law to obtain magnetic fields in magnetostatics for 
any distribution of current. 
(5)  An understanding of how to calculate the forces and torques on a current element in 
an external magnetic field or on a charge moving in an external magnetic field, 
including the characteristics of cyclotron motion. 
(6)  An understanding of the concept of a magnetic dipole and the forces and torques on 
such a dipole in an external magnetic field.  
(7)  An understanding of inductance and the ability to calculate it for simple geometries.  
(8)  An understanding of the behavior of DC and AC circuits involving resistors, 
capacitors, inductors and any combination thereof.

(9)  An understanding of the concepts of energy in electric and magnetic fields, and of 

energy flow in the Poynting vector. 

(10) An ability do to analytic and conceptual problems related to plane electromagnetic 
waves—e.g. obtain E given B and vice versa, determine the direction of propagation, 
and so on. 
(11)  An understanding of the concepts of interference and diffraction, and the ability to do 
simple (conceptual) problems related to these concepts.  
(12) An ability to calculate the Poynting flux vector and integrals of that vector over 
surfaces to show energy conservation in situations involving, for example, a charging 
or discharging capacitor, a resistor, a charging or discharging battery, and an inductor 
where the current is increasing or decreasing. This means that you should both be 
able to do the analytic calculations and explain their physical significance.
