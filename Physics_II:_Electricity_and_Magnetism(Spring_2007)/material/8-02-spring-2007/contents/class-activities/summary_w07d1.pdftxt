Topic Introduction 

 
Last week we focused on how moving charges and currents create magnetic fields.  This 
week we will turn our focus to the forces that moving charges feel when in a magnetic field.   
 
Lorenz Force 
In addition to being created by moving charges, magnetic fields 
also exert forces on moving charges.  This force is called the 
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
v B(cid:71)
F
Lorenz Force and is given by 
 (where q is the charge of 
q=
×
the particle, v its velocity and B the magnetic field).  The fact that 
the force depends on a cross product of the charge velocity and the 
field can make forces from magnetic fields very non-intuitive.

The direction of the force 
 can be determined by the

right hand rule pictured at right (thumb in direction of v, fingers in 
direction of B, palm shows direction of force).  It is perpendicular to both the velocity of the 
charge and the magnetic field, and thus charges will follow curved trajectories while moving 
in a magnetic field, and can even move in circles (in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic 
field).  The ability to make charges curve by applying a magnetic field is used in a wide 
variety of scientific instruments, from mass spectrometers to particle accelerators, and we 
will discuss some of these applications in class. 
 
Lorenz Force on Currents 
Since a current is nothing more than moving charges, a current carrying wire will also feel a

(cid:71)
 (where I is the current, and L is a vector 
force when placed in a magnetic field:

pointing along the axis of the wire, with magnitude equal to the length of the wire).   
 
Magnetic Dipole Moment 
Next we turn our attention to loops of current, which act in the same way as 
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
, where I is the 
magnetic dipoles, where the dipole moment is written 
I=µ A
current in the loop and the direction of A, the area vector, is determined by a 
right hand rule:  
 
Right Hand Rule for Direction of Dipole Moment 
To determine the direction of the dipole moment of a coil of wire:  wrap 
your fingers in the direction of current.  Your thumb points in the direction 
of the North pole of the dipole (in the direction of the dipole moment µ of 
the coil).

Summary of Class 17 
 
Magnetic moments behave in magnetic fields the same way that electric dipole moments 
behave in electric fields.  If not aligned with the field, the dipole experiences a torque trying 
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
to align it: 
.  If (and only if) the field is non-uniform it will feel a force.

moments using an equation 
Dipole =

actually much more instructive to think about what forces 
will result by thinking of the dipole as one bar magnet, 
and imagining what arrangement of bar magnets would 
be required to create the non-uniform magnetic field in 
which it is sitting.  Once this has been done, determining 
the force is straight forward (opposite poles of magnets attract).

As an example of this, consider a current loop sitting in a diverging 
magnetic field (pictured above).  In what direction is the force on the 
loop? 
In order to answer this question one could use the right hand rule and 
find that the force on every current element is outward and downward, 
so the net force is down.  An often easier way is to realize that the 
current loop looks like a bar magnet with its North pole facing up and 
that the way to create a field as pictured is to put another bar magnet 
with North pole up below it (as pictured at left).  Once redrawn in this 
fashion it is clear the dipole will be attracted downwards, towards the 
source of the magnetic field.  
 
A third way to think about the forces on dipoles in fields is by looking 
(cid:71)(cid:71)
at their energy in a field: U = − ⋅µ B
.  That is, dipoles can reduce their 
energy by rotating to align with an external field (hence the torque). 
Once aligned they will move to high B regions in order to further 
reduce their energy (make it more negative).
