PRS02 

 
 
 
Electric field lines in the space 
surrounding a charge distribution show: 
 
1. Directions of the forces that exist in 
space at all times. 
2. Only directions in which static charges 
would accelerate when at points on 
those lines 
3. Only directions in which moving 
charges would accelerate when at 
points on those lines. 
4. Directions in which either static or 
moving charges would accelerate 
when passing through points on those 
lines. 
5. Paths static or moving charges would 
take.

The force between the two charges is: 
1) Attractive 
2) Repulsive 
3) Can’t tell without more information

E-Field of Five Equal Charges 

PRS02 

 
Six equal positive charges q sit at the 
vertices of a regular hexagon with sides 
of length R.  We remove the bottom 
charge.  The electric field at the center of 
the hexagon (point P) is:

E-Field of a Dipole 

PRS02 

 
 

 
As you move to large distances r 
away from a dipole, the electric 
field will fall-off as: 
1) 1/r2, just like a point charge 
2) More rapidly than 1/r2 
3) More slowly than 1/r2 
4) Who knows? 
 

 
 
PRS02 
 
An electric dipole, consisting of two 
equal and opposite point charges at the 
ends of an insulating rod, is free to rotate 
about a pivot point in the center.  The rod 
is placed in a non-uniform electric field.  

 

The dipole will experience 
1. a noticeable electric force and no 
noticeable electric torque 
2. no noticeable electric force and a 
noticeable electric torque 
3. a noticeable electric force and a 
noticeable electric torque 
4. no noticeable electric force and no 
noticeable electric torque
