Topic Introduction 

Today we will investigate the behavior of DC circuits containing resistors and either 
capacitors or inductors (RC & RL circuits).  We discussed their behavior in the class before 
the most recent exam.  Now, in experiment #6, you will have a chance to measure their 
behavior yourself. 

RC & RL Circuits 

A simple RC circuit is shown at right.  When the switch is closed, 
current will flow in the circuit, but as time goes on this current will 
decrease.  We can write down the differential equation for current 
flow by writing down Kirchhoff’s loop rules, recalling that 
 for a capacitor and that the charge Q on the capacitor
∆V 
= Q C
is related to current flowing in the circuit by  I  = ±dQ  dt , where the 
sign depends on whether the current is flowing into the positively 
charged plate (+) or the negatively charged plate (-).  The solution to 
this differential equation shows that the current decreases 
exponentially from its initial value while the potential on the 
capacitor grows exponentially to its final value.  The rate at which 
this change happens is dictated by the “time constant” τ, which for 
this circuit is given by τ= RC . 

If we replace the capacitor with an inductor we find a similar but 
opposite result.  Now the current starts at zero and “decays” upward 
to a constant value, now with a time constant τ = L/R (a big 
inductance slows down the circuit as it is more effective at opposing 
changes, but now a big resistance reduces the size of the current and 
hence changes in the current that the inductor will see, and thus 
decreases the time constant – speeds things up). 

Decay Down 

“Decay” Up 

Interestingly, in RC & RL circuits any value that you could ask about (current, potential drop 
across the resistor, across the capacitor, …) “decays” exponentially (either down or up).  You 
should be able to determine which of the two plots at right a value will follow just by 
thinking about it.

Experiment 6:  RC and RL Circuits 
Preparation:  Read pre-lab and answer pre-lab questions 

This extended lab will introduce you to the techniques of measuring current and voltage in a 
circuit and then allow you to observe the exponential behavior of RC and RL circuits as they 
are “charged” and “discharged” using a battery which periodically turns on and off.  You will 
measure the time constant of several circuits and investigate how it changes as resistance, 
inductance or capacitance are modified.
