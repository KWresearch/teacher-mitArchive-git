Math Background 
 
Are you familiar with these concepts 
from vector calculus? 
 

1. I’ve never seen them before, and I 
am not so comfortable with math 
2. I’ve never seen them before, but I 
pick up new math concepts quickly 
3. I’ve seen them before, but 
definitely need some review 
4. I am comfortable with vector 
calculus

Two opposite charges are placed on a 
line as shown below. The charge on the 
right is three times larger than the charge 
on the left.  Other than at infinity, where 
is the electric field zero? 
 

qL 

qR 

 

 
1. Between the two charges 
2. To the right of the charge on the right 
3. To the left of the charge on the left 
4. The electric field is nowhere zero 
5. Not enough information – need to 
know which charge is positive
