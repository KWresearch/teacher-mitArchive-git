General Exam Suggestions 
•  You should be able to complete every problem 
•  If you are confused, ask 
•  If it seems too hard, you aren’t thinking enough 
•  Look for hints in other problems 
•  If you are doing math, you’re doing too much 
•  Read directions completely (before & after) 
•  Write down what you know before starting 
•  Draw pictures, define (label) variables 
•  Make sure that unknowns drop out of solution 
•  Don’t forget units!

Problem 1:  RLC Circuit 
Consider a circuit consisting of an AC voltage 
source: V(t)=V0sin(ωt) connected in series to a 
capacitor C and a coil, which has resistance R and 
inductance L0. 

1.  Write a differential equation for the current in this 
circuit. 
2.  What angular frequency ωres  would produce a 
maximum current? 
3.  What is the voltage across the capacitor when 
the circuit is driven at this frequency?

Problem 1, Part 2:  RLC Circuit 
Continue considering that LRC circuit. 
Insert an iron bar into the coil.  Its inductance 
changes by a factor of 5 to L=Lcore 

4.  Did the inductance increase or decrease? 
5.  Is the new resonance frequency larger, smaller 
or the same as before? 
6.  Now drive the new circuit with the original ωres. 
Does the current peak before, after, or at the 
same time as the supply voltage? 

P31-

31

Solution 1, Part 2:  RLC Circuit 

4.  Putting in an iron core INCREASES the 
inductance 

5.  The new resonance frequency is smaller 

6.  If we drive at the original resonance frequency 
then we are now driving ABOVE the resonance 
frequency.  That means we are inductor like, 
which means that the current lags the voltage.

Problem 2: Self-Inductance 

(cid:65) 

The above inductor consists of two solenoids 
(radius b, n turns/meter, and radius a, 3n 
turns/meter) attached together such that the 
current pictured goes counter-clockwise in both of 
them according to the observer. 
What is the self inductance of the above inductor?
