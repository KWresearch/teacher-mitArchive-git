Topic Introduction 

Today we are  focusing on understanding and calculating  the electric  field generated by a 
continuous distribution of  charge.   We will do problem  solving #2, which highlights  this 
concept and the associated calculations. 

Charge Distributions 
Electric  fields  “superimpose,”  or  add,  just  as  gravitational  fields  do.    Thus  the  field 
generated  by  a  collection  of  charges  is  just  the  sum  of  the  electric  fields  generated  by 
each  of  the  individual  charges.    If  the  charges  are  discrete,  then  the  sum  is  just  vector 
addition. 
If  the  charge  distribution  is  continuous  then  the  total  electric  field  can  be 
calculated  by  integrating  the  electric  fields  dE  generated  by  each  small  chunk  of  charge 
dq in the distribution. 

Charge Density 
When describing the amount of charge in a continuous charge distribution we often speak 
of  the  charge  density.  This  function  tells  how  much  charge  occupies  a  small  region  of 
space  at  any  point  in  space.   Depending  on  how  the  charge  is  distributed, we will  either 
consider the volume charge density  ρ= dq  dV  , the surface charge density σ= dq  dA , or 
the  linear charge density λ= dq  d A , where V, A and  A stand  for volume, area and  length 
respectively.
