PRS20 

 
 
 
The current carrying coil above 
will move  
1. upwards 
2. downwards 
3. stay where it is because the 
total force is zero 

 
 
 
Loop in Changing Field 
 
 

PRS20 

 
 
The magnetic field through a wire 
loop is pointed upwards and 
increasing with time.  The induced 
current in the coil is  
 

1. Clockwise as seen from the top 
2. Counterclockwise

Loop in Changing Field 

 
 

 

 
 
The magnetic field through a 
circular wire loop is pointed 
upwards and decreasing with time.  
The induced current in the coil is  
 
1. Clockwise as seen from the top 
2. Counterclockwise  

 
 

 

PRS20 

 

 
When the coil is below the magnet and 
moving downwards.  This induces a 
current as pictured.  The I ds x B force on 
the coil is 
 

1. Upwards 
 
2. Downwards   
 
3. Zero
