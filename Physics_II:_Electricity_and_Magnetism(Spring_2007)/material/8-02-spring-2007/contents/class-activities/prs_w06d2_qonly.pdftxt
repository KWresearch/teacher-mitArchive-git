The magnetic field at P is equal 
to the field of: 
1. a semicircle 
2. a semicircle plus the 
field of a long straight wire 
3. a semicircle loop minus 
the field of a long straight wire

Two Particles 
Two positive charges are mounted 
on tracks that force them to move at 
constant velocities. The magnetic 
force on the charge q1 due to q2 
points in the direction of:  

 

4. -x  
1. +x    
5. -y  
2. +y    
3. +z    
6. -z  
7. Nothing (zero force) 
8. Points in some other direction
