A very useful computational technique 
This is important!

Gauss’s Law – The Idea

The total “flux” of field lines penetrating any of 
these surfaces is the same and depends only 
on the amount of charge inside

Open and Closed Surfaces

A rectangle is an open surface — it does NOT contain a volume  
A sphere is a closed surface — it DOES contain a volume 

15
P05 -

Area Element dA:  Closed Surface
For closed surface, dA is normal to surface 
and points outward
( from inside to outside)

ΦE > 0 if E points out

ΦE < 0 if E points in

Choosing Gaussian Surface
Choose surfaces where E is perpendicular & constant. 
Then flux is EA or -EA.
OR
Choose surfaces where E is parallel.
Then flux is zero

Example:  Uniform Field
Flux is EA on top
