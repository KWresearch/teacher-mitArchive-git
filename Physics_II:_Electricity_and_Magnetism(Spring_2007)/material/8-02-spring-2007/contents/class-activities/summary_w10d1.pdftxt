Topic Introduction 

Today we continue thinking about self inductance, in which the changing flux from a circuit 
induces an EMF in itself.  We will then discuss the use of inductors in circuits. 

Self Inductance 
Remember that we defined the self inductance L by the amount of flux that an object 
generates through itself when a current I flows through it (Φ = LI) and, from Faradays Law, 
found that inductors will generate a back EMF: ε = − L d I   d t  . 

An inductor is a circuit element whose main characteristic is its inductance, L. It is drawn as 
a coil 
 in circuit diagrams.  The strong resemblance to a solenoid is intentional – 
solenoids make very good inductors both because of their ability to make a strong field inside 
themselves, and also because the field they produce is fairly well contained, and hence 
doesn’t produce flux (and induce EMFs) in other, nearby circuits. 

The role of an inductor is to oppose changing currents.  At steady state, in a DC circuit, an 
inductor is off – it induces no EMF as long as the current through it is constant.  As soon as 
you try to change the current through an inductor though, it will fight back.  In this sense an 
inductor is the opposite of a capacitor.  If a capacitor is placed in a steady state current it will 
eventually fill up and “open” the circuit, whereas an inductor looks like a short in this case.  
On the other hand, when starting from its uncharged state, a capacitor looks like a short when 
you first try to move current through it (no voltage drop), while an inductor looks like an 
open circuit, as it prevents the change (from no current to some current). 

Energy in B Fields 
Where do inductors get the energy to source current when they need to?  In capacitors we 
found that energy was stored in the electric field between their plates.  In inductors, energy is 
similarly stored, only now its in the magnetic field.  Just as with capacitors, where the 
electric field was created by a charge on the capacitor, we now have a magnetic field created 
when there is a current through the inductor.  Thus, just as with the capacitor, we can discuss

stored in the magnetic field.  Again, although we introduce the magnetic field energy density 
when talking about energy in inductors, it is a generic concept – whenever a magnetic field is 
created it takes energy to do so, and that energy is stored in the field itself.

RL Circuits 

A simple RL circuit is shown below.  When the switch is closed, no current will initially flow 
in the circuit,

but as time goes on this current will increase.  We can write down 
the differential equation for current flow by using Faraday’s Law. 
We begin by calculating the line integral of the electric field around 
the loop. There are two contributions to this integral: the electric 
field in the wire and the electric field in the battery. If we orient the 
line integral in the direction of the electric field in the wire (the 
electric field in the battery points in the opposite direction) then

Now the current starts at zero and “decays” upward to a constant value, now with a time 
constant τ = L/R (a big inductance slows down the circuit as it is more effective at opposing 
changes, but now a big resistance reduces the size of the current and hence changes in the 
current that the inductor will see, and thus decreases the time constant – speeds things up). 

Interestingly, in RL circuits any value that you could ask about (current, potential drop across 
the resistor, …) “decays” exponentially (either down or up).  You should be able to 
determine which of the two plots (above and to the  right a value) will follow just by thinking 
about it.
