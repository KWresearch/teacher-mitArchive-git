Advantages of Groups

• Three heads are better than one
• Don’t know?  Ask your teammates
• Do know?  Teaching reinforces knowledge
Leave no teammate behind!
• Practice for real life – science and 
engineering require teamwork; learn to 
work with others

P04 -

What Groups Aren’t

• A Free Ride
We do much group based work (labs & 
Friday problem solving).  Each individual 
must contribute and sign name to work

If you don’t contribute (e.g. aren’t in class) 
you don’t get credit

P04 -

Group Isn’t Working Well?

1. Diagnose problem and solve it yourself 
-- Most prevalent MIT problem:  free rider.
2. Talk to Grad TA
3. Talk to the teamwork consultant
Don’t wait:  Like most problems,
teamwork problems get worse 
the longer you ignore them

P04 -

Introduce Yourselves

Please discuss:
• What is your experience in E&M?
• How do you see group working?
• What do you expect/want from class?
• What if someone doesn’t participate?
• What if someone doesn’t come to class?

Try to articulate solutions to foreseeable 
problems now (write them down)

Experiment 1:  Visualizations

Need experiment write-up from course 
packet.
Turn in tear sheet at end of class
Each GROUP hands in ONE tear sheet 
signed by each member of group

What is the electric potential

How much energy in joules is 
required to put the three 
charges in the configuration 
pictured if they start out at 
infinity?

Suppose you move a fourth change +3Q from 
infinity in to point P.  How much energy does 
that require (joules)?
