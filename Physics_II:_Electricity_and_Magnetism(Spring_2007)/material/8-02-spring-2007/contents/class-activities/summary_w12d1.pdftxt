Topic Introduction 

Today we investigate LRC circuits.  We will see that the current in these circuits oscillates, in 
a fashion completely analogous to the oscillation of a mass on a spring 

Mass on a Spring:  Simple Harmonic Motion 
In  a  simple  system  consisting  of  a mass  hanging  on  a  spring, when  the mass  is  pulled  down 
and released it oscillates up and down.  We think about this in a couple of ways.  One way is 
to  look  at  the  forces  on  the  mass  and  write   a  differential  equation  for  its  motion, 
k x , where  x  means two time derivatives of the displacement (acceleration).  The 
F  = m x = −
 
solution to this is simple harmonic motion:  x = x0  c o s (ωt )  where ω= 
k m . 

We  can  also  think  about  the  energy  in  the  system.    As  the  mass  moves,  energy  oscillates 
between  kinetic  energy  of  the mass  and  potential  energy  stored  in  the  spring.    If  there  is  no 
damping (friction) in the system to dissipate energy, the oscillation will continue forever. 

Undriven L(R)C Circuits 

Consider  the  LC  circuit  at  left,  where  the  switch  is  at  “a”  

until  the  capacitor  is  fully  charged  and  then  thrown  to  “b.”

This  is  analogous  to  pulling  down  a  mass  and  releasing  it.  

Here  the  capacitor  will  want  to  discharge  and  will  drive  a  

current  through  the  inductor.  Eventually all  the charges will  

run off of  the capacitor (spring), so  it won’t “push” anymore, but now  the  inductor will want  

to keep the current flowing through it that it already has (inductors, like masses, have inertia).  

It will keep  the  current  flowing, but  that will  eventually  fill up  the  capacitor which will  stop  

the  current  and  send  it  back  the  other  direction.   Our  differential  equation  is  thus  analogous,  

q= 0  c o s (ωt ) where ω=  1  L C . 
V  = − L q  = q C , and has the same solution:  q

We  can  also  think  about  energy  here,  where  it  oscillates 
between  being  stored  in  the  electric  field  in  the  capacitor 
and  the magnetic  field  in  the  inductor.   As  long  as  there  is 
no dissipation  (resistance)  is  the circuit  the oscillations will 
continue forever. 

If we add a resistor in series with the capacitor and inductor 
we provide a method of energy loss, through joule heating 
in the resistor as current flows.  The oscillations will thus 
damp out to zero.  The exact path the charge will take as it

oscillates to zero depends on the relative sizes of L, R and C, but will typically look 
something like the curve above, where the oscillations are bounded by an “envelope” which 
is exponentially decaying to zero as a function of time.

Driven LRC Circuits 
We  can  also  add  a  force  to  our  circuits  –  the  AC  power  supply.    In  this 
case  the  current  responds  at  the  drive  frequency.  However,  depending  on 
the  frequency of  the drive,  the current may be out of phase  (either  leading 
or  lagging  the  drive)  and  its  amplitude will  also  vary.    This  is  easily  seen 
ω0 
in mechanical  systems.    For  a  fantastic  example,  play  with  the  pendula  at 
ω 
the Kendall T  station.  Depending  on how  fast  you  drive  them  they will  respond  either  in  or 
out  of  phase  with  your  drive,  and  they  will  either move  a  little  or  a  lot.   When  you  drive  at 
the natural frequency, the amplitude increases greatly, and the system is “in resonance.” 

One Element at a Time 
In order driven LRC circuits  its easiest  to start  thinking about  individual circuit elements.   A 
resistor obeys Ohm’s law:  V=IR.  Neither the amplitude nor phase of the voltage depends on 
the frequency (the response voltage is always in phase with the current). 
A capacitor is different.  At low frequencies the capacitor “fills up,” but at high frequencies it 
begins  discharging  before  “filling  up.”    The  voltage  is  frequency  dependent  and  the  current 
leads the voltage (current flows before the charge/potential on the capacitor appears). 
An  inductor  is  the  opposite  –  it  hates  the  change  of  high  frequencies  and  thus  has  large 
voltages there – and the current lags – the inductor fights before current flows. 
When  put  together  in  LRC  circuits,  the  capacitor  “dominates”  at  low  frequencies,  the 
inductor  at  high  ones.  At  resonance  (ω=  1  L C )  the  frequency  is  such  that  these  two 
effects  balance  and  the  current  will  be  largest  in  the  circuit.    Also  at  this  frequency  the 
current is in phase with the driving voltage (the AC power supply).

Seeing it Mathematically – Phasors 
To do  this mathematically we will use phasor diagrams.   A phasor  is a 
0 LV
vector  whose  magnitude  is  the  amplitude  of  either  voltage  or  current 
and whose  angle  corresponds  to  its  phase.  Phasors  rotate CCW  about 
the origin with time as their phase evolves, and their current amplitude 
is their component along the y-axis, which oscillates as it should. 
0CV 
Phasors allow us  to add voltages  that are not  in phase with each other. 
For  example,  the  phasor  diagram  above  illustrates  the  relationship  of 
voltages  in  a  series  LRC  circuit.  The  current  I  is  assigned  to  be  at  “0  phase”  (along  the  x-
axis).  The  phase  of  the  voltage  across  the  resistor  is  the  same.    The  voltage  across  the 
inductor  L  leads  (is  ahead  of  I)  and  the  voltage  across  the  capacitor  C  lags  (is  behind  I).  If 
you add up (using vector arithmetic) the voltages across R, L & C (the red and dashed blue & 
green  lines  respectively)  you  arrive  at  the voltage  across  the power  supply.   This  then gives 
you  a  rapid  way  of  understanding  the  phase  between  the  drive  (the  power  supply)  and  the 
response (the current) – here labeled φ.
