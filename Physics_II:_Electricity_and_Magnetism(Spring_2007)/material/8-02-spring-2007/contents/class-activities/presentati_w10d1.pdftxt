General Exam Suggestions
• You should be able to complete every problem
• If you are confused, ask
• If it seems too hard, you aren’t thinking enough
• Look for hints in other problems
• If you are doing math, you’re doing too much
• Read directions completely (before & after)
• Write down what you know before starting
• Draw pictures, define (label) variables
• Make sure that unknowns drop out of solution
• Don’t forget units!

a)  The current is flowing counter-clockwise, as shown above

b)  There are three segments of the wire:  the semi-circle, the 
two horizontal leads, and the two vertical leads.
The two vertical leads do not contribute to the B field (ds || r)
The two horizontal leads make an infinite wire a distance D 
from the field point.

Problem 4:  Solenoid
A current I flows up a very long solenoid 
and then back down a wire lying along its 
axis, as pictured.  The wires are negligibly 
small (i.e. their radius is 0) and are 
wrapped at n turns per meter.
a)  What is the force per unit length 
(magnitude and direction) on the straight 
wire due to the current in the solenoid?
b)  A positive particle (mass m, charge q) 
is launched inside of the solenoid, at a 
distance r = a to the right of the center.  
What velocity (direction and non-zero 
magnitude) must it have so that the field 
created by the wire along the axis never 
exerts a force on it?

Solution 4:  Solenoid
SUPERPOSITION
You can just add the two fields from each 
part individually
a)  Force on wire down axis
Since the current is anti-parallel to the field 
produced by the solenoid, there is no force 
(F=0) on this wire
b)  Launching Charge q
The central wire produces a field that wraps 
in circles around it.  To not feel a force due to 
this field, the particle must always move 
parallel to it – it must move in a circle of 
radius a (since that is the radius it was 
launched from).
