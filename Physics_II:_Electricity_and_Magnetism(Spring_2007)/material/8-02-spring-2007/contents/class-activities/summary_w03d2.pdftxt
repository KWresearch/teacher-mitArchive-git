Topic Introduction 

In this class we look at a new way of calculating electric fields – Gauss's law. Not only is 
Gauss's law (the first of four Maxwell’s Equations) an exceptional tool for calculating the 
field  from  symmetric  sources,  it  also  gives  insight  into  why  E-fields  have  the  r-
dependence that they do. 

The  idea  behind  Gauss’s  law  is  that,  pictorially,  electric  fields  flow  out  of  and  into 
charges.    If  you  surround  some  region  of  space  with  a  closed  surface  (think  bag),  then 
observing  how much  field  “flows”  into or out of  that  surface  tells  you  how much  charge 
is  enclosed  by  the  bag.    For  example,  if  you  surround  a  positive  charge  with  a  surface 
then  you will  see  a  net  flow  outwards, whereas  if  you  surround  a  negative  charge with  a 
surface you will see a net flow inwards. 

Electric Flux 
The picture of fields “flowing” from charges is formalized in the definition of the electric 
JG
flux.  For any  flat surface of area A,  the  flux of an electric  field  E  through  the surface  is

defined  as  Φ = E A  , where  the direction of  A   is normal  to  the  surface.   This  captures

the idea that the “flow” we are interested in is through the surface – if  E  is parallel to the 
surface then the flux  Φ = 0

We can generalize  this  to non-flat  surfaces by breaking up  the  surface  into  small patches 
which are flat and then integrating the flux over these patches.  Thus, in general:

Gauss’s Law 
Gauss’s  law  states  that  the  electric  flux  through  any  closed  surface  is  proportional  to  the 
total charge enclosed by the surface:

A closed surface is a surface which completely encloses a volume, and the integral over a 
closed surface S is denoted by  w∫∫ .

Symmetry and Gaussian Surfaces 
Although  Gauss’s  law  is  always  true,  as  a  tool  for  calculation  of  the  electric  field,  it  is 
only  useful  for  highly  symmetric  systems.  The  reason  that  this  is  true  is  that  in  order  to 
JG
solve for the electric field  E  we need to be able to “get it out of the integral.”  That is, we 
need  to  work  with  systems  where  the  flux  integral  can  be  converted  into  a  simple 
multiplication.    Examples  of  systems  that  possess  such  symmetry  and  the  corresponding 
closed Gaussian surfaces we will use to surround them are summarized below:

Solving Problems using Gauss’s law 
Gauss’s  law  provides  a  powerful  tool  for  calculating  the  electric  field  of  charge 
distributions  that  have  one  of  the  three  symmetries  listed  above. The  following  steps  are 
useful when applying Gauss’s law: 

(1) Identify  the  symmetry  associated  with  the  charge  distribution,  and  the  associated 
shape of “Gaussian surfaces” to be used. 
(2) Divide  space  into  different  regions  associated  with  the  charge  distribution,  and 
determine  the  exact  Gaussian  surface  to  be  used  for  each  region.  The  electric  field 
must be constant or known (i.e. zero) across the Gaussian surface. 
(3) For each region, calculate  qenc , the charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface. 
(4) For each region, calculate the electric flux Φ E  through the Gaussian surface. 
(5) Equate  Φ E  with  qenc  / ε0  , and solve for the electric field in each region.

Gauss’s  Law  applies  to  closed  surfaces—that  is,  a  surface  that  has  an  inside  and  an 
outside (e.g. a basketball).  We can compute the electric flux through any surface, open or 
closed,  but  to  apply Gauss’s  Law we must  be  using  a  closed  surface,  so  that we  can  tell 
how much charge is inside the surface.   

Gauss’s Law  is  our  first Maxwell’s  equations,  and  concerns  closed  surfaces.   Another of

we will see.
