Topic Introduction 

In today’s class we calculate the force on a charged particle moving in a magnetic field and 
the torque on a rectangular loop of wire. 

Lorenz Force on Moving Charges Currents

A charged particle moving in a magnetic field feels a force  F = qv G × B .  Similarly, a piece of

current carrying wire placed in a magnetic field will feel a force:  dF = Id s × B  (where ds is a 
small segment of wire carrying a current I).  We can integrate this force along the length of 
any wire to determine the total force on that wire. 

Right Hand Rules 
Because of the cross product in the Biot-Savart Law, the direction of 
the resulting magnetic field is not as simple as when we were working 
with electric fields.  In order to quickly see what direction the field 
will be in, or what direction the force on a moving particle will be in, 
we can use a “Right Hand Rule.”  At times it seems that everyone has 
their own, unique, right hand rule.  Certainly there are a number of 
them out there, and you should feel free to use whichever allow you to 
get the correct answer.  Here I describe the four that I use.

The important thing to remember is that cross-products yield a result which is 

perpendicular to both of the input vectors.  The only open question is in which of 

the two perpendicular directions will the result point (e.g. if the vectors are in the 

floor does their cross product point up or down?).  Using your RIGHT hand:

1)  For determining the direction of the force of a field on a moving charge:  open 

your hand perfectly flat.  Put your thumb along v and your fingers along B.  Your 

palm points along the direction of the force. 


2)  For determining the direction of the magnetic field generated by a current:  

fields wrap around currents the same direction that your fingers wrap around your 
thumb.  At any point the field points tangent to the circle your fingers will make as you 

twist your hand keeping your thumb along the current.

3)  For determining the direction of the dipole moment of a coil of wire:  wrap your 

fingers in the direction of current.  Your thumb points in the direction of the North pole 

of the dipole (in the direction of the dipole moment µ of the coil). 

Torque Vector 
I’ll tack on one more right hand rule for those of you who don’t remember what the 
direction of a torque τ means.  If you put your thumb in the direction of the torque

thumb (very similar to RHR #2 above).
