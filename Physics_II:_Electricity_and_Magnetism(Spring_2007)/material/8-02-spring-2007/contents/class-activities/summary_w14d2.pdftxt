Exam 3 Information 

TEST THREE Thursday Evening May 10 from 7:30-9:30 pm.  The Friday class 
immediately following is canceled because of the evening exam. Please see 
announcements for room assignments for Exam 3. 

What We Expect From You On The Exam 

(1)  The ability to calculate the inductance of specific circuit elements, for example that of 
a long solenoid with N turns, radius a, and length L. 

(2) An understanding of current flow in a resistive material, e.g. how J is related to I, 
how E is related to J, how resistance is related to resistivity, and how to calculate it. 

(3)  An  understanding  of  simple  circuits.  For  example,  you  should  be  able  to  set  up  the 
equations  for  multi-loop  circuits,  using  Kirchhoff’s  Laws.  You  should  be  able  to 
derive  and  guess  the  solution  to  differential  equations  for  both  RL  and  RC  circuits, 
and should understand the meaning of time constants (τ = L/R, τ = RC) 

(4)  An  understanding  of  the  concept  of  energies  stored  in  magnetic  fields,  that  is 
for  the  total magnetic  energy  stored  in  an  inductor,  and 
for  the 
energy  density  in  magnetic  fields.  You  also  should  review  the  concept  of  energies 
stored  in  electric  fields,  that  is 
for  the  total  electric  energy  stored 
in a capacitor, and 
for the energy density in electric fields. 

(5)  An understanding of the nature of the free oscillations of an RLC circuit. 

(6)  An understanding of the nature of the driven oscillations of an RLC circuit. 

(7)  An understanding of Maxwell’s equations, including Maxwell’s addition to Ampere’s 
Law  (displacement  current).  You  should  be  able  to  produce  and  identify  each  of 
Maxwell’s  equations,  as  well  as  give  brief  explanations  of  the  meaning  and  use  of 
each  of  them  (don’t  be  surprised  by  a  question  like  “State  each  of  Maxwell’s 
equations and briefly explain their meaning and typical use.”) 

(8)  An understanding of electromagnetic radiation.  In particular, an ability do to analytic 
and conceptual problems related to plane EM waves — e.g. obtain E given B and 
vice versa, determine the direction of propagation, and so on. 

(9) An understanding of the Poynting vector and energy transport. 

To  study  for  this  exam  we  suggest  that  you  review  your  problem  sets,  in-class 
problems, Friday problem solving sessions, PRS in-class questions, and relevant 
parts of the study guide and class notes.
