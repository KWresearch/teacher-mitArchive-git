A point charge +Q is 
O1
placed at the center of 
I1
the conductors.  The 
induced charges are:  
 
 
1.  Q(I1) = Q(I2) = -Q;   
Q(O1) = Q(O2)= +Q 
 
2.  Q(I1) = Q(I2) = +Q;   
Q(O1) = Q(O2)= -Q 
 
3.  Q(I1) = -Q;  Q(O1) = +Q 
Q(I2) = Q(O2)= 0 
 
4.  Q(I1) = -Q;  Q(O2)= +Q 
Q(O1) = Q(I2)= 0

potential at O1 is:  
 
 
1.  Higher than at I1  
 
2.  Lower than at I1

the conductors.  If a wire 
is used to connect the 
two conductors, then 
positive charge will flow

Capacitor Circuit 
 
Three  identical capacitors are connected 
to a battery as pictured. 
The battery is then 
disconnected. 
How do the charge on 
A, B & C compare 
before and after the 
battery is removed?

  BEFORE;    AFTER   
1.  QA = QB = QC;  No Change 
2.  QA = QB = QC;  QA > QB = QC 
3.  QA = QB = QC;  QA < QB = QC 
4.  QA > QB = QC;  No Change 
5.  QA > QB = QC;  QA = QB = QC 
6.  QA < QB = QC;  No Change 
7.  QA < QB = QC;  QA = QB = QC

 Dielectric in a Capacitor 
 
A parallel plate capacitor is charged to a 
total charge Q and the battery removed.  
A slab of material with dielectric 
constant κ is inserted between the plates.  
The charge stored in the capacitor 
 

 
1.  Increases  
2.  Decreases 
3.  Stays the Same
