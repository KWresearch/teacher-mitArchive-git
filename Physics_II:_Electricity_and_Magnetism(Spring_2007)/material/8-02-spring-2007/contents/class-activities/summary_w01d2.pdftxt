Topic Introduction 
Today we review the concept of electric charge, and describe both how charges create 
electric fields and how those electric fields can in turn exert forces on other charges.  Again, 
the electric field is completely analogous to the gravitational field, where mass is replaced by 
electric charge, with the small exceptions that (1) charges can be either positive or negative 
while mass is always positive, and (2) while masses always attract, charges of the same sign 
repel (opposites attract).  We will also introduce the concepts of understanding and 
calculating the electric field generated by a continuous distribution of charge.   

Electric Charge 
All objects consist of negatively charged electrons and positively charged protons, and hence, 
depending on the balance of the two, can themselves be either positively or negatively 
charged.  Although charge cannot be created or destroyed, it can be transferred between 
objects in contact, which is particularly apparent when friction is applied between certain 
objects (hence shocks when you shuffle across the carpet in winter and static cling in the 
dryer). 

Electric Fields 
Just as masses interact through a gravitational field, charges interact through an electric field.  
Every charge creates around it an electric field, proportional to the size of the charge and

strong enough it can actually rip the electrons off of  atoms in the air, allowing charge to flow 
through the air and making a spark, or, on a larger scale, lightening. 

Charge Distributions 
Electric fields “superimpose,” or add, just as gravitational fields do.  Thus the field generated 
by a collection of charges is just the sum of the electric fields generated by each of the 
individual charges.  If the charges are discrete, then the sum is just vector addition.  If the 
charge distribution is continuous then the total electric field can be calculated by integrating

the electric fields dE  generated by each small chunk of charge dq in the distribution.

Charge Density 
When describing the amount of charge in a continuous charge distribution we often speak of 
the charge density.  This function tells how much charge occupies a small region of space at 
any point in space.  Depending on how the charge is distributed, we will either consider the 
volume charge density  ρ= dq  dV  , the surface charge density σ= dq  dA , or the linear 
charge density λ= dq  d A , where V, A and  A stand for volume, area and length respectively. 

Electric Dipoles 
The electric dipole is a very common charge distribution consisting of a positive and negative 
charge of equal magnitude q, placed some small distance d apart.  We describe the dipole by 
its dipole moment p, which has magnitude p = qd and points from 
the negative to the positive charge.  Like individual charges, 
dipoles both create electric fields and respond to them.  The field 
created by a dipole is shown at left  (its moment is shown as the 
purple vector).  When placed in an external field, a dipole will 
attempt to rotate in order to align with the field, and, if the field is 
non-uniform in strength, will feel a force as well.

A hat (e.g.  Aˆ ) over a vector means that that vector is a unit vector (
