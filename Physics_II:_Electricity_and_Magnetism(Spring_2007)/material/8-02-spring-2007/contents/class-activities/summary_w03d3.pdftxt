Topic Introduction 

In  this  class  we  will  practice  calculating  electric  fields  using  Gauss's  law  by  doing 
problem  solving  #3.    Remember  that  the  idea  behind  Gauss’s  law  is  that,  pictorially, 
electric  fields  flow out of and  into charges.    If you  surround  some  region of  space with a 
closed  surface  (think  bag),  then  observing  how  much  field  “flows”  into  or  out  of  that 
surface  tells you how much charge  is enclosed by  the bag.   For example,  if you surround 
a  positive  charge  with  a  surface  then  you  will  see  a  net  flow  outwards,  whereas  if  you 
surround a negative charge with a surface you will see a net flow inwards. 

Gauss’s Law 
Gauss’s  law  states  that  the  electric  flux  through  any  closed  surface  is  proportional  to  the 
total charge enclosed by the surface:

S 
A closed surface is a surface which completely encloses a volume, and the integral over a 
closed surface S is denoted by  w∫∫
 . 
Symmetry and Gaussian Surfaces 
Although  Gauss’s  law  is  always  true,  as  a  tool  for  calculation  of  the  electric  field,  it  is 
only useful for highly symmetric systems. The  reason  for  this  is  that  in order  to solve  for 
JG
the electric field  E  we need  to be able  to “get  it out of  the  integral.”   That  is, we need  to 
work with  systems where  the  flux  integral  can be  converted  into  a  simple multiplication. 
Examples of systems that possess such symmetry and the corresponding closed Gaussian 
surfaces we will use to surround them are summarized below:

Solving Problems using Gauss’s law 
Gauss’s  law  provides  a  powerful  tool  for  calculating  the  electric  field  of  charge 
distributions  that  have  one  of  the  three  symmetries  listed  above. The  following  steps  are 
useful when applying Gauss’s law: 

(1) Identify  the  symmetry  associated  with  the  charge  distribution,  and  the  associated 
shape of “Gaussian surfaces” to be used. 
(2) Divide  space  into  different  regions  associated  with  the  charge  distribution,  and 
determine  the  exact  Gaussian  surface  to  be  used  for  each  region.  The  electric  field 
must be constant or known (i.e. zero) across the Gaussian surface. 
(3) For each region, calculate  qenc , the charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface. 
(4) For each region, calculate the electric flux Φ E  through the Gaussian surface. 
(5) Equate  Φ E  with  qenc  / ε0  , and solve for the electric field in each region.
