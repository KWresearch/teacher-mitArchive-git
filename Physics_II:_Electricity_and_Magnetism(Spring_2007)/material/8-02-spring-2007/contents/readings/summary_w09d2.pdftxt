(9) Faraday’s Law of Induction 

Topic Introduction 
Today we continue our discussion of induction (Faraday’s Law), discussing another 
application – eddy current braking – and then continuing on to define mutual inductance and 
transformers. 

Faraday’s Law & Lenz’s Law 
Remember that Faraday’s Law tells us that a changing magnetic flux generates an EMF 
(electromotive force): 
G 
v G
G
G 
d Φ B  , where  Φ = ∫∫ B A  
is the magnetic flux, and ε=  ∫ E′ ⋅ d s  is the EMF
ε= −
⋅ d 
B 
d t  
G 
In the formula above,  E′ is the electric field measured in the rest frame of the circuit, if the 
circuit is moving.   Lenz’s Law tells us that the direction of that EMF is so as to oppose the 
change in magnetic flux.  That is, if there were a physical loop of wire where you are trying 
to determine the direction of the EMF, a current would be induced in it that creates a flux to 
either supplement a decreasing flux or decrease an increasing flux. 

Applications 
As we saw in the last class, a number of technologies rely on induction to work – generators, 
microphones, metal detectors, and electric guitars to name a few.  Another common 
application is eddy current braking.  A magnetic field penetrating a metal spinning disk (like 
a wheel) will induce eddy currents in the disk, currents which circle inside the disk and exert 
a torque on the disk, trying to stop it from rotating.  This kind of braking system is commonly 
used in trains.  Its major benefit (aside from eliminating costly service to maintain brake 
pads) is that the braking torque is proportional to angular velocity of the wheel, meaning that 
the ride smoothly comes to a halt. 

Mutual Inductance 
As we saw last class, there are several ways of changing the flux through a loop – by 
changing the angle between the loop and the field (generators), the area of the loop (the 
sliding bar problem) or the strength of the field.  In fact, this last method is the most 
common.  Combining this idea with the idea that magnetic fields are typically generated by 
currents, we can see that changing currents generate EMFs.  This is the idea of mutual 
inductance:  given any two circuits, a changing current in one will induce an EMF in the 
d I1
other, or, mathematically, ε = −M 
, where M is the mutual inductance of the two 
2 
d t  
circuits.  How does this work?  The current in loop 1 produces a magnetic field (and hence 
flux) through loop 2.  If that current changes in time, the flux through 2 changes in time, 
creating an EMF in loop 2.  The mutual inductance, M, depends on geometry, both on how 
well the current in the first loop can create a magnetic field and on how much magnetic flux

through the second loop that magnetic field will create.  Interestingly, mutual inductance is 
symmetric – if you flip the subscripts in the above equation, it remains true.   

Transformers 

A major application of mutual inductance is the transformer, which 
allows the easy modification of the voltage of AC (alternating 
current) signals.  At left is a picture/schematic of a step up 
transformer, which will take an input signal on the primary (of 
input voltage VP) and create an output signal on the secondary (of, 
in this case larger, output voltage VS).  How does it work?  The 
primary coil creates an oscillating magnetic field as an oscillating 
current is driven through it.  This magnetic field is “steered” 
through the iron core – recall that ferromagnets like iron act like 
wires for magnetic fields, allowing the field to be bent around in a loop, as is done here.  As 
the oscillating magnetic field punches through the many turns of the secondary coil, it 
generates an oscillating flux through them, which will induce an EMF in the secondary.  If all 
else is equal and the core is perfect in its guiding of the field lines, the amount of flux 
generated and received is directly proportional to the number of turns in each coil.  Hence the 
ratio of the output to input voltage is the same as the ratio of the number of turns in the 
secondary to the number of turns in the primary.  As pictured we have more turns in the 
secondary, hence this is a “step up transformer,” with a larger output voltage than input.   

The ease of creating transformers is a strong argument for using AC rather than DC power, 
and is one of the reasons that our main power system is AC.  Why?  Before sending power 
across transmission lines, the voltage is stepped up to a very high voltage (240,000 V), which 
leads to lower energy losses as the currents flow through the transmission lines (think about 
why this is the case).  The voltage is then stepped down to 240 V before going into your 
home.
