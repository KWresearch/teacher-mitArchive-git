Topic Introduction 
Today we continue our discussion of conductors & capacitors, including an introduction to 
dielectrics, which are materials which when put into a capacitor decrease the electric field 
and hence increase the capacitance of the capacitor. 

Conductors & Shielding 
Last time we noted that conductors were equipotential surfaces, and 
that all charge moves to the surface of a conductor so that the electric 
field remains zero inside.  Because of this, a hollow conductor very 
effectively separates its inside from its outside.  For example, when 
charge is placed inside of a hollow conductor an equal and opposite 
charge moves to the inside of the conductor to shield it.  This leaves an 
equal amount of charge on the outer surface of the conductor (in order 
to maintain neutrality).  How does it arrange itself?  As shown in the 
picture at left, the charges on the outside don’t know anything about 
what is going on inside the conductor.  The fact that the electric field is zero in the conductor 
cuts off communication between these two regions.  The same would happen if you placed a 
charge outside of a conductive shield – the region inside the shield wouldn’t know about it.  
Such a conducting enclosure is called a Faraday Cage, and is commonly used in science and 
industry in order to eliminate the electromagnetic noise ever-present in the environment 
(outside the cage) in order to make sensitive measurements inside the cage. 

Capacitance 

Series 

Last time we introduced the idea of a 
capacitor as a device to store charge.  This 
time we will discuss what happens when 
multiple capacitors are put together.  There 
are two distinct ways of putting circuit 
elements (such as capacitors) together: in 
series and in parallel.  Elements in series 
(such as the capacitors and battery at left) 
are connected one after another.  As shown, 
the charge on each capacitor must be the 
same, as long as everything is initially 
uncharged when the capacitors are connected (which is always the 
case unless otherwise stated).  In parallel, the capacitors have the same potential drop across 
them (their bottoms and tops are at the same potential).  From these setups we will calculate 
the equivalent capacitance of the system – what one capacitor could replace the two 
capacitors and store the same amount of charge when hooked to the same battery.  It turns

Dielectrics 
A dielectric is a piece of material that, when inserted into an electric field, has a reduced 
electric field in its interior.  Thus, if a dielectric is placed into a capacitor, the electric field in 
that capacitor is reduced, as is hence the potential difference between the plates, thus 
≡
∆ ).  The effectiveness of a 
increasing the capacitor’s capacitance (remember,  C Q V
dielectric is summarized in its “dielectric constant”  κ.  The larger the dielectric constant, the 
more the field is reduced (paper has κ=3.7, Pyrex κ=5.6).  Why do we use dielectrics?  
Dielectrics increase capacitance, which is something we frequently want to do, and can also 
prevent breakdown inside a capacitor, allowing more charge to be pushed onto the plates 
before the capacitor “shorts out” (before charge jumps from one plate to the other).

Experiment 3:  Faraday Ice Pail 
Preparation:  Read lab write-up.  
 
In this lab we will study electrostatic shielding, and how charges move on conductors when 
other charges are brought near them.  We will also learn how to use Data Studio, software for 
collecting and presenting data that we will use for most of the remaining experiments this 
semester.  The idea of the experiment is quite simple.  We will have two concentric 
cylindrical cages, and can measure the potential difference between them.  We can bring 
charges (positive or negative) into any of the three regions created by these two cylindrical 
cages.  And finally, we can connect either cage to “ground” (e.g. the Earth), meaning that it 
can pull on as much charge as it wants to respond to your moving around charges.  The point 
of the lab is to get a good understanding of what the responses are to you moving around 
charges, and how the potential difference changes due to these responses.
