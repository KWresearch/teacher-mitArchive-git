Topic Introduction 

 
Today we continue our discussion of conductors & capacitors, including an introduction to 
dielectrics, which are materials which when put into a capacitor decrease the electric field 
and hence increase the capacitance of the capacitor. We will define current, current density, 
and resistance. 
 
Conductors & Shielding 
Last time we noted that conductors were equipotential surfaces, and 
that all charge moves to the surface of a conductor so that the electric 
field remains zero inside.  Because of this, a hollow conductor very 
effectively separates its inside from its outside.  For example, when 
charge is placed inside of a hollow conductor an equal and opposite 
charge moves to the inside of the conductor to shield it.  This leaves an 
equal amount of charge on the outer surface of the conductor (in order 
to maintain neutrality).  How does it arrange itself?  As shown in the 
picture at left, the charges on the outside don’t know anything about 
what is going on inside the conductor.  The fact that the electric field is zero in the conductor 
cuts off communication between these two regions.  The same would happen if you placed a 
charge outside of a conductive shield – the region inside the shield wouldn’t know about it.  
Such a conducting enclosure is called a Faraday Cage, and is commonly used in science and 
industry in order to eliminate the electromagnetic noise ever-present in the environment 
(outside the cage) in order to make sensitive measurements inside the cage. 
 
 
Experiment 2:  Faraday Ice Pail 
Preparation:  Read pre-lab reading and answer pre-lab questions  
 
In this lab we will study electrostatic shielding, and how charges move on conductors when 
other charges are brought near them. The idea of the experiment is quite simple.  We will 
have two concentric cylindrical cages, and can measure the potential difference between 
them.  We can bring charges (positive or negative) into any of the three regions created by 
these two cylindrical cages.  And finally, we can connect either cage to “ground” (e.g. the 
Earth), meaning that it can pull on as much charge as it wants to respond to your moving 
charges around.  The point of the lab is to get a good understanding of what the responses are 
to you moving charges around, and how the potential difference changes due to these 
responses. 
 
Current and Current Density 
Electric currents are flows of electric charge. Suppose a collection of charges is moving 
perpendicular to a surface of area A, as shown in the figure

The electric current I is defined to be the rate at which charges flow across the area A. If an 
amount of charge ∆Q passes through a surface in a time interval ∆t, then the current I is

Microscopic Picture of Current Density 
dv(cid:71) , 
If charge carriers in a conductor have number density n, charge q, and a drift velocity  
(cid:71)
dv(cid:71) .  In Ohmic conductors, the drift 
then the current density  J  is the product of n, q, and

 of the charge carriers is proportional to the electric field 
E
This proportionality arises from a balance between the acceleration due the electric field and 
the deceleration due to collisions between the charge carriers and the “lattice.”  In steady 
state these two terms balance each other, leading to a steady drift velocity (a “terminal”
