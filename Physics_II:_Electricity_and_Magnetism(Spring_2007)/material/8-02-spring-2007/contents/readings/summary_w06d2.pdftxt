Topic Introduction 

 

 

 
Today we cover two topics. At first, in experiment #3, we will measure the magnetic fields 
created by bar magnets and by a couple of coils placed in a special configuration, called a 
Helmholtz coil.  Then we will discuss Ampere’s Law, the magnetic equivalent of Gauss’s 
Law. 
 
Ampere’s Law  
With electric fields we saw that rather than always using Coulomb’s law, which gives a 
completely generic method of obtaining the electric field from charge distributions, when the 
distributions were highly symmetric it became more convenient to use Gauss’s Law to 
calculate electric fields. The same is true of magnetic fields – Biot-Savart does not always 
provide the easiest method of calculating the field. In cases where the current source is very 
symmetric it turns out that Ampere’s Law, another of Maxwell’s four equations, can be used, 
greatly simplifying the task.  
 
Ampere’s law rests on the idea that if you have a curl in a magnetic field (that is, if it wraps 
around in a circle) the field must be generated by some current source inside that circle (at 
the center of the curl). So, if we walk around a loop and add up the magnetic field heading in 
our direction, then if, when we finish walking around, we have seen a net field wrapping in 
the direction we walked, there must be some current penetrating the loop we just walked

, where on the left we

are integrating the magnetic field as we walk around a closed loop, and on the right we add 
up the total amount of current penetrating the loop.  
 

In the example pictured here, a single long wire carries current 
out of the page.  As we discussed in class, this generates a 
magnetic field looping counter-clockwise around it (blue l
ines).  
On the figure we draw two “Amperian Loops.”  The first loo

(yellow) has current I penetrating it.  The second loop (red) has 
no current penetrating it.  Note that as you walk around the
 
yellow loop the magnetic field always points in roughly the

We use Ampere’s law in a very similar way to how we used Gauss’s law.  For highly 
symmetric current distributions, we know that the produced magnetic field is constant along 
certain paths.  For example, in the picture above the magnetic field is constant around any

Solving Problems using Ampere’s law 
Ampere’s law provides a powerful tool for calculating the magnetic field of current 
distributions that have radial or rectangular symmetry. The following steps are useful when 
applying Ampere’s law:  
 
 (1) Identify the symmetry associated with the current distribution, and the associated shape 
of “Amperian loops” to be used. 
 (2) Divide space into different regions associated with the current distribution, and determine 
the exact Amperian loop to be used for each region. The magnetic field must be constant, 
perpendicular to or known (i.e. zero) along each part of the loop. 
 (3) For each region, calculate  p e n e t r a t e
, the current penetrating the Amperian loop.

Experiment 3:  Magnetic Fields of a Bar Magnet and Helmholtz Coil 
Preparation:  Read pre-lab and answer pre-lab questions 
 
 
In this lab you will measure the magnetic field generated by a bar magnet and by a special 
current configuration called a Helmholtz coil, thus getting a feeling for magnetic field lines 
generated by magnetic dipoles.  Recall that as opposed to electric fields generated by 
charges, where the field lines begin and end at those charges, fields generated by dipoles 
have field lines that are closed loops (where part of the loop must pass through the dipole).
