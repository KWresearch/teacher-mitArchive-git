Topic Introduction 
Today we will derive the facts about EM waves that were simply stated in the last class.  We 
will also derive the wave equation from our full set of Maxwell’s Equations.    
 
Maxwell’s Equations and EM Radiation 
Everything about EM radiation is derivable from Maxwell’s equations so they bear repeating:

Today we will use Faraday’s Law (3) and Maxwell-Ampere’s Law (4) to show that 
propagating magnetic fields generate electric fields and that propagating electric fields 
generate magnetic fields, leading to commingled EM waves that propagate together through 
space.  In the process we will derive the wave equation for electromagnetic radiation, which 
shows that electromagnetic waves propagate at a speed

Note that we have experimentally measured these two constants in Experiments 2 and 8, in a 
manner that was easily possible in the 1800’s, and our results from those experiments was 
within 20% of the accepted value of the speed of light.

We take an electromagnetic wave 
propagating in the positive x-direction and 
polarized as shown in the figure.  
Applying the Maxwell-Ampere’s Law  to 
the loop shown to the left, we will derive 
the following differential relation between 
the electric and magnetic fields of the 
wave:

For the same wave as show above, applying 
Faraday’s Law  to the loop shown to the left, 
we will derive another differential relation 
between the electric and magnetic fields of the 
wave: 
 
 
 
If we then combine the two relations we have 
above, we find that the electric field of the 
wave must satisfy the one dimensional wave

The solutions to this equation are waves propagating at the speed of light.  We will also 
derive the relations we have previously stated between the magnitudes and direction of E and 
B.
