Topic Introduction 
Today we practice using Faraday’s Law to calculate the current in and force on a loop falling 
through a magnetic field.  

Faraday’s Law & Lenz’s Law 
Remember that Faraday’s Law tells us that a changing magnetic flux generates an EMF 
(electromotive force):  
G 
v G
G
G 
dΦ B  , where  Φ = ∫∫ B A  
is the magnetic flux, and ε=  ∫ E′ ⋅ d s  is the EMF
ε= −
⋅ d 
B 
d t  
G 
In the formula above,  E′ is the electric field measured in the rest frame of the circuit, if the 
circuit is moving.   The sign indicates that the EMF opposes the change in flux – I suggest 
you use Lenz’s Law to get the direction and just report the magnitude of the EMF (i.e. drop 
the minus sign). As is usual, the flux integral nearly always turns into a simple 
multiplication: BA. 

Lenz’s Law tells us that the direction of that EMF is so as to oppose the change in magnetic 
flux. That is, if there were a physical loop of wire where you are trying to determine the 
direction of the EMF, a current would be induced in it that creates a flux to either supplement 
a decreasing flux or decrease an increasing flux. Remember that, in general, opposing a 
change in flux means opposing what is happening to change the flux (e.g. forces or torques 
oppose the change).

                                                                                if the circuit is moving.
