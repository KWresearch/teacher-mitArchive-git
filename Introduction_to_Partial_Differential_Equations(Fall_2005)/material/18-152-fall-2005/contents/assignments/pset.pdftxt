Problem  1.  Prove  that a Harmonic  function with an  interior maximum  is  constant.


Problem  2.  Write  out  the  laplacian  in  plane­polar  coordinates.

Problem  3.  A  Green’s  function  on  Rn  is  a  harmonic  function  on  Rn  \ {0}  which

depends  only  on  the  radius  (for  example  log r  on  R2 ).  Find  non­trivial  Green’s  functions 
for  all  dimensions. 
Problem  4.  The  heat  equation  for  a  function  u  :  R × [0, ∞)  is  ∂ 2 u  =  ∂u .  Find  all 
∂x2 
∂ t 
solutions  of  the  form  u = f (t)g(x). 
Problem  5.  Find  all  solutions  u  of  the  heat  equation  on  [0, 1] × [0, ∞) with  the  u = 0 
on  ({0} ∪ {1}) × [0, ∞).
