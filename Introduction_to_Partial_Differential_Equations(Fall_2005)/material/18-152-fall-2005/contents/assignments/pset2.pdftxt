Problem  1.  Let u be a  function on  the ball B1 (0) ⊂ R2  with  B1 (0)  |�u|p  <]inf ty  for 
some  constant  p > 2.  Show  that  u  is  holder  continuous.  [Hint:  Use Morrey  on  1.|�u|2 ] 
Problem  2.  Let  u  :  Rn  →  R,  and  deﬁne  oscBr (x)u  =  supBr (x) u − inf Br (x) u.  Show 
that  if  there  is  some  constant  0 < γ  < 1  with 
oscBr (x)u ≤ γ oscB2r (x)u 
for  all  x  and  all  r  then  u  is  Holder  continuous.

Let  u  be  a  function  with  Lu  ≥  0,  and  Φ  :  R →  R  a  function  with  Φ� , Φ��  ≥  0.  Show  that 
L(Φ(u)) ≥ 0.
