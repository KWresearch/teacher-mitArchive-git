***** Partial Differential Equation Assignment 1 *****
Assignment 1 as a (PDF)
**** Problem 1 ****
Prove that a Harmonic function with an interior maximum is constant.
**** Problem 2 ****
Write out the laplacian in planepolar coordinates.
**** Problem 3 ****
A Green's function on n is a harmonic function on n \{0} which depends only on
the radius (for example log r on 2). Find nontrivial Green's functions for all
dimensions.
**** Problem 4 ****
The heat equation for a function u:  Ã [0, â) is . Find all solutions of the
form u = Æ(t)g(x).
**** Problem 5 ****
Find all solutions u of the heat equation on [0, 1] Ã [0, â) with the u = 0
on ({0} âª {1}) Ã [0, â).
***** Partial Differential Equation Assignment 2 *****
Assignment 2 as a (PDF)
**** Problem 1 ****
Let u be a function on the ball B1(0) â 2 with â«B1(0) |u|p <]infty for some
constant p > 2. Show that u is holder continuous. [Hint: Use Morrey on â«
1.|u|2 ]
**** Problem 2 ****
Let u: n â , and define OSCBr(x)u = supBr(x)u - infBr(x)u. Show that if there
is some constant 0 < Î³ < 1 with
oscBr(x)u â¤ Î³ oscB2r(x)u
for all x and all r then u is Holder continuous.
**** Problem 3 ****
Let L be a uniformly elliptic 2nd order operator in divergence form taking
Let u be a function with Lu â¥ 0, and Î¦:  â  a function with Î¦', Î¦" â¥
0. Show that L(Î¦(u))â¥ 0.
**** Problem 4 ****
Let L be an operator as in question 3, and let u be an L harmonic function.
Prove that |u|2 is holder contiuous. [This is likely to be difficult.]
