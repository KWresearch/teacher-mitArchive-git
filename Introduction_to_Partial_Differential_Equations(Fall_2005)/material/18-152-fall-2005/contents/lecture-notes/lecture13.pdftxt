Heat  equation  gradinet  estimate  on  a  ball


1 

generalising  the  proof  from  last  time 

Last  time  we  proved  a  gradient  estimate  for  functions  that  satisfy  the  heat  equation  on 
a  cylinder,  To  do  this  we  needed  to  know  that  the  function  didn’t  have  a  maximum  on  a 
boundary.  We’ll  now  generalise  this  proof  to work  on  a  ball Br .  To  do  this we will  need  to 
introduce  a  cutoﬀ  function.  Again  we  will  prove  the  case  r = 1.  Take  u  : B2  × [0.∞) → R 
.  Let  φ  : B2  → R  with  φ = 0  on  ∂B2  and  φ = 1  on  B1 .  As  before  we  deﬁne 
with  �u = 
∂u 
∂ t 
f  =  log u,  and  F  = |�f | −  ∂ t ,  and  try  to  estimate  (� −  ∂ t )φk F .  We  have

Last  time  we  showed  that

and  then  I  think  we’re  meant  to  use  the  maximum  principle  on  φk f  to  ﬁnish  it  oﬀ  but 
neither my  notes  nor Yaims  actually  states  the  result we’re  aiming  for,  or  goes  any  further 
in  the  proof.  can  you  point  out mhow  I’m  meant  to  ﬁnish  it?  thanks.
