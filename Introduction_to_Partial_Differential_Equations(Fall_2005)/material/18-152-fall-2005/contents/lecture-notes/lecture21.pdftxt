The  mean  value  inequality:  Iterative  argument 

In  this  lecture  we  will  prove  a  mean  value  inequality  for  uniformy  elliptic  operators  in 
divergence  form  .  The  argument  is  an  iterative  one  due  to  De  Georgi,  Nash,  and  Moser. 
As  usual  we  take  L  an  operator  with 

∂ 
∂u 
(1)
Lu = 
Aij 
∂xi 
∂xj 
and  λ|v |2  ≤ Aij vivj  ≤ Λ v 2  for  all  vectors  v .  Let  u  be  a  function  satisfying  u ≥ 0, Lu ≥ 0.

Take  x0  a  point,  and R  a  ﬁxed  positive  number.  Let φ  be  a  test  function  on BR (x0 ) which 
is  zero  on  the  boundary.  Clearly � 
BR (x0 )

Now  work  on  the  other  term.  At  each  point  the  matrix  A  deﬁnes  a  good  metric,  so 
Cauchy­Schwarz  applies,  and  we  get  −φuAij

This  should be  familiar,  as we  proved  it  on  the way  to  the Cacciopolli  inequality  in  lecture

for  a  constant  k = 2 +  8Λ2 .  Now  we  need  to  use  the  Sobolev  inequality.  For  Simplicity  we

will  assume  that  n ≥ 3,  but  a  similar  result  holds  in  the  other  cases.

We  won’t  prove  this  here.  Apply  it  with  w  =  φu  (this  has  compact  support  because  φ

Deﬁne  Ar,k  =  Br (x0 ) ∩ {u  >  k},  and  let  Ar,k |  be  the  volume  of  this  set.  For  any

function  f  deﬁne  f+  to  be  the  positive  part,  i.e.

Note  that  if u  is L harmonic  then u+  is L harmonic  almost  everywhere,  and  claim without 
proof  that  everything  we’ve  done  today  goes  through  for  the  positive  part  of  a  harmonic
