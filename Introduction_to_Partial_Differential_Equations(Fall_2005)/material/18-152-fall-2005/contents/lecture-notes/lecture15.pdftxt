1  The  decay  of  solutions  of  the  heat  equation 

A  few  lectures  ago  we  introduced  the  heat  equation 
�u = ut 
(1) 
� 
for  functions  of  both  space  and  time.  we will  now  bound  the  decay  of  the Dirichlet  energy 
and  the L2  norm  (ie  u2 ) of  solutions.  If u  solves  the heat equation on Ω ⊂ Rn  with u = 0

2  Campanato’s  Lemma 

Before  discussing  Campanato’s  lemma  we  need  the  concept  of  Holder  continuity. 
→
Deﬁnition  Let  f  : Rn  R  be  a  continuous  function.  f  is  α  continuous  at  x0  if  there  are 
constants  k  and  0 < α ≤ 1  such  that 
f (x0  + x) − f (x0 ) ≤ k x

for  small  x0 .  If  f  is  everywhere  Holder  continuous  for  some  constant  α  then  we  say  that 
f  ∈ C α .

Now  take  f  continuous  on  Rn .  Let  x ∈ Rn ,  and  deﬁne

We  apply  this  to  our  problem.  Note  that  Ax,2−k r  − Ax,r  = �i=k−1 Ax,2−i−1 r  − Ax,2−i r ,

This  is  simply  the  sum  of  a  geometric  series,  so  we  can  use  the  usual  formula  to  get 
1 − 2−kα

and  we’re  only  interested  in  small  x − y ,  so  we  can  take  2 x − y ≤ 1  to  get

Morrey’s  lemma  is  very  similar  to  Campanato’s  lemma,  but  uses  a  condition  on  Dirichlet 
energy  rather  than  L2  norm. 
Lemma  3.1  (Morrey’s  lemma)  Let  f  :  Rn 
� 
with 
Br (x) 
for  al l  x  and  smal l  r  then  f  ∈ C α . 
Proof  This  is  a  straightforward  consequence  of  Campanato  and  Poincare.  By  Poincare

there  is  a  constant  c2  such  that
