The  Hopf  maximum  principle  for  uniformly  elliptic  oper­
ators 

The  next  result  that  we  will  generalise  is  the  Hopf  Maximum  principle.  As  before  we  will 
consider  uniformly  elliptic  operators  L  taking 

∂ 2f 
Lf  = Aij ∂xi∂xj 
with  λ|v| < v · Av ≤ Λ v 2  for  some  real  0 < λ ≤ Λ.

Theorem  1.1  (The Hopf Maximum  principle  for  uniformly  el liptic  operators)  Let  u  be  an 
L  harmonic  function  on Br (0)  with  a  strict maximum  at  x ∈ ∂Br (0)  .  There  are  constants 
C  which  depend  only  on  L  and  the  dimension  such  that 
C (u(x) − u(0)).

Theorem 1.1 will then follow easily once we have a harnack inequaltity for elliptic operators. 
Proof  This proof  is  similar  to  the  earlier  version,  though  a bit more  complicated.  We will 
prove  the  case  r  =  1  and  claim  that  the  general  result  follows  by  scaling  exactly  as  it  did 
for  the  previous  Hopf maximum  principle.  Let  α  be  a  constant,  and  deﬁne 
v(x) = e−α|x|2  − e−α .

and  so  picking  α  large  we  can  get  Lv ≥ 0  on  the  annulus. 
Consider  u + �v .  Clearly  this  is  subharmonic  on B1 \ B1/2 ,  so  it  takes  it’s maximum  on 
either  the  inner  or  the  outer  boundary.  We’ll  pick  �  so  that  it  occurs  at  x.  We  need

Another  proof  of  the  Harnack  inequality 

We  will  now  give  an  alternative  proof  of  the  Harnack  inequality.  It  is  based  on  a  gradient 
estimate  that  is  slightly  stronger  than  the  one  we  proved. 

Proposition  2.1  Let  u  be  a  positive  harmonic  function  on  B2r .  Then

u).

We  will  prove  this  next  time. 
We  can  derive  the  Harnack  inequality  from  this  as  follows.  Pick  x  and  y  in  Br ,  and 
let  γ1  be  the  straight  path  from  x  to  0,  and  γ2  the  straight  path  from  0  to  y .  Note  that
