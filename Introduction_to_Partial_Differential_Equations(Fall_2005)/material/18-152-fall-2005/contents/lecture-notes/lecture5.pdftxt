The  Cacciopolli  Inequality 

The  Cacciopolli  (or  Reverse  Poincare)  Inequality  bounds  similar  terms  to  the  Poincare 
inequalities  studied  last  time,  but  the  other  way  around.  The  statement  is  this.

2  Applications  of  the  Cacciopolli  Inequality 

2.1  Bounding  the  growth  of  a  harmonic  function 

One nice consequence of the Cacciopolli Inequality  is the following  inequality bounding the 
rate  at  which  a  harmonic  function  can  decay.

u  ≥ (1 + k(n))

2.2  Bounding  the  growth  of  the  energy  of  a  harmonic  function 

We  will  now  prove  a  similar  inequality  for  the  Dirichlet  energy  of  a  harmonic  function.

Secondly we use Cacciopolli, noting that if �u = 0 then �(u+A) = 0, and �(u+A) = �u, 
�

to  give 
(u − A)2 .
