Lecture Four:  The Poincare  Inequalities


In  this  lecture  we  introduce  two  inequalities  relating  the  integral  of  a  function  to  the 
integral  of  it’s  gradient.  They  are  the  Dirichlet­Poincare  and  the  Neumann­Poincare  in­
equalities.

It  is  not  diﬃcult  to  extend  these  proofs  to  higher  dimensional  cubes. 

There  is  another  interesting  fact  related  to  the  Neumann­Poincare  inequality.  If  we
