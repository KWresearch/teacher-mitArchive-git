Before  proving  these  we  will  prove  another  inequality,  the mean  value  inequality.

This  completes  the  proof  of  2.  The  ﬁnal  inequality,  4,  follows  from  2  in  exactly  the  same 
way  that  3  follows  from  1. 
We can also prove 1, 2, 3, and 4 for L harmonic operators when L is a uniformly elliptic
