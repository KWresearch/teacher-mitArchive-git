An  Improved Gradient Estimate  for Harmonic Functions

The  new  gradient  estimate 

Last  lecture  we  used  an  improved  form  of  the  gradient  estimate  for  harmonic  functions. 
We  will  now  prove  it.

Proof  We  will  prove  the  result  for  r = 1  and  claim  that  the  general  case  follows  immedi­
ately  by  scalng.  As  usual  we  take  a  non­negative  test  function  φ  : B2  → R  with  φ =  0  on 
∂B2 .  Deﬁne  v  =  log u  and  w  =  |�v | .  Note  that  �v  =  �u  and  �v  = − |�u| = −w.  We

Now  try  to  ﬁnd  our  quartic  bound.  Consider

This  is  the  bound  we  were  looking  for. 
Now  apply  this.  Since φ  is  zero  on  the  boundary  of B2 ,  φ4w  takes  it’s maximum  in  the 
interior.  Let  x  be  the maximum.  At  x, �(φ4w) = 0  and  0 ≥ �(φ4w),  so

This  is  a  quartic  polynomial  in  φw1/2  with  positive  leading  coeﬃcient.  Such  polynomials 
are positive for large argument, so there is a constant k with  φ(x)(w(x))1/2 ≤ k .  Note that 
|
|
k  depends  only  on  the  coeﬃcients  of  the  polynomial.  The  coeﬃcients  themselves  depend 
only  on  dimension,  so  k  also  depends  only  on  dimension.  Choose  0 ≤ φ ≤ 1.  Then 
sup φ4 w = (φ(x))4 w(x) ≤ (φ(x)(w(x))1/2 )2  ≤ k2 .

Finally  we  choose  φ  to  be  identically  one  on  B1 ,  so

and  take  square  roots  to  give  our  result. 

The  gradient  estimate  we  proved  earlier  follows  easily  from  this;  this  is  a  stronger 
result.  As  we  saw  last  time  the  Harnack  inequality  is  also  a  reasonably  straightforward 
consequence.  The  only ma jor  annoyance  is  that  we  needed  u > 0.
