2  The  Gradient  Estimate 

We  now  prove  a  gradient  estimate  for  harmonic  functions. 

Theorem  2.1  There  are  dimensional  constants  c(n)  such  that 

c(n)
sup  |u|. 
|�u| ≤ 
sup 
r  B2r (x0 ) 
Br (x0 ) 
for  al l  harmonic  functions  u  on  B2r (x0 ) ⊂ Rn 

(3) 

Proof  Note  that  it  suﬃces  to  check  the  case  x0  = 0.  Now  proceed  as  follows. 

Step  1.  Show  that  a  sub­harmonic  function  on  a  ball  takes  it’s  maximum  on  the 
boundary.  Let p  : B2r (x0 ) → R be sub­harmonic.  Note that �|x 2  = 2n, so �(p+� x 2 ) > 0
|
|
|
for  all  � > 0,  Therefore,  by  the maximum  principle,  p + �|x|2  has  no  interior maximum,  so 
→
it’s maximum  occurs  on  the  boundary.  Letting  � 
0 we  see  that  p  takes  its maximum  on 
the  boundary  as  well. 

Step  2.  Prove  the  result  for  r = 1.  Take  u  harmonic  on  B2 (0),  and  introduce  a  test 
function  φ  with  φ =  0  on  the  boundary  of  B2 (0)  and  φ >  0  on  the  interior.  We  will  work 
with �(φ2 |�u|2 ),  and  apply  Bochner  to  simplify.  Calculate

Observe that �(u2 ) = 2u�u+2|�u 2  = 2|�u 2  since �u = 0. Let k(n) =  inf B2 (0) (−8|�φ

(8) 
By  step  1  supB2 (0) (φ2 |�u|2 + k(n)u2 )  occurs  on  the  boundary.  Furthermore  φ  vanishes  on 
the  boundary,  so  we  get 
sup  k(n)u  ≥  sup  φ2

Step  3.  Extend  this  to  general  r .  If  u  is  harmonic  on  B2r (0)  deﬁne  ˜u(x) =  u(x/r), 
and  note  that  ˜u  is  harmonic  on  B2 (0).  Therefore,  by  (11),

supB1 (x0 ) |� ˜
u ≤ c(n)supB2 (0) u ,

so 

This  completes  the  proof.
