1  The  Weak  deﬁnition  of  a  harmonic  function 

u = 0 

It  is  sometimes  useful  to  weaken  the  notion  of  a  harmonic  function  somewhat.  One  way 
of  doing  this  is  with  the  notion  of  a  weakly  harmonic  function.  Let  u  be  a  diﬀerentiable 
� 
function  on  some  set  Ω.  We  say  that  u  is  weakly  harmonic  on  Ω  if 
�φ · �
Ω 
for  all  diﬀerentiable  functions  φ  with  φ = 0  on  ∂Ω.  One  nice  thing  about  this  deﬁnition  is 
that  we  don’t  need  u  to  be  as  smooth  as  we  did  for  the  old  deﬁnition,  so  this  really  is  a 
weaker  condition. 
� 
The  two  deﬁnitions  of  harmonic  are  linked  by  Stokes’  theorem.  If  we  take  u  to  be 
harmonic  then 
� 
Ω 
∂Ω 
� 
Applying  Stokes’  theorem  to  this  we  recover  the  weak  deﬁnition 
�φ · �
Ω 
and  it  easy  to  run  this  argument  backwards  for  C 2  functions.

2  Generalizations  of  the  Laplacian 

Over  the  last  few  lectures  we  have  proved  some  results  about  the  laplacian  and  harmonic 
functions.  Now  we  will  try  to  generalise  some  of  these.  We  will  consider  operators  of  the

form

where  A  is  a  symmetric  n  by  n  matrix  with  entries  aij  (not  necessarily  constant).  An 
operator  written  like  this  is  said  to  be  in  divergence  form  since  Lu  =  div(A�u).  Note 
that  if A  is  the  identity matrix  then  L  is  simply  the  laplacian.  We  will  often  be  interested 
in  functions  satisfying  Lu  =  0.  Such  functions  are  called  L­harmonic.  There  is  also  the 
� 
concept  of  a  weakly  L  harmonic  function,  where 
Ω 
by  a  similar  argument  to  section  1  any  L­harmonic  function  is  weakly  L­harmonic.

2.1  Uniformly  Elliptic  Operators 

Operators  where  the  matrix  A  satisﬁes 
λ|v|2 
≤< Av, v >≤ Λ v

for  some  real  0  <  λ  ≤  Λ  and  for  all  vectors  v  are  of  particular  interest.  These  operators 
are  said  to  be  uniformly  elllptic.  If  there  is  a  lower  bound  but  not  an  upper  bound  the 
operator  is  simply  said  to  be  elliptic.  We  can  extend  many  of  the  results  we  proved  for 
harmonic  functions  to  functions  solving  any  uniformly  elliptic  operator.

The  ﬁrst  result  that we will  generalise  is  the Cacciopolli  inequality.  This  is  almost  exactly 
the  same  inequality  as  for  harmonic  functions.
