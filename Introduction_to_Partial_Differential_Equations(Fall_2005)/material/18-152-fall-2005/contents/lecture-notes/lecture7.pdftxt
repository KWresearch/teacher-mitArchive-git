Consequences  of  Cacciopolli 

In  this  lecture  we  continue  to  generalise  some  of  our  results  about  the  Laplacian  to  uni­
formly  elliptic  second  order  operators.  We  start  by  stating  two  results  without  proof. 
Proposition  1.1  Let  B2r  be  a  bal l  in  Rn ,  and  let  L  be  a  uniformly  el liptic  second  order 
operator  with 
Lf  = � · A�f , 
and  λ|v|2 
Av  ≤  Λ v 2 .  There  are  positive  constants  c,  and  d  depending  only  on  the

and

(1) 

for  al l  u  with  Lu = 0  on  B2r . 

This  is  very  similar  to  a  result  for  harmonic  functions  from  Lecture  5,  but  we  will  not 
give  the  proof  here.  Instead we will work  on  some  of  the  consequences.  it  is  clear  from  (1) 
� 
� 
that  if  u  is  L  harmonic  (ie  Lu = 0)  on  B2m s  then 
u  ≥ (1 + c)m

It runs out that a slightly weaker version of (4) holds for all t, not just when t/m is a power 
of  2.

We  can  do  exactly  the  same  calculation  for  the  Dirichlet  energy  to  give

There  is  a  nice  corollary  to  this

Corollary  1.4  Take  u : Rn  R  an  L harmonic  function.  If

then  u = 0  on  Rn .

Proof  Suppose  u  is  not  identically  zero,  say  u(x0 ) = 0.  Then 
B1 (x0 ) 
� 
Bt (x0 ) 
which  goes  to  inﬁnity  as  t  gets  large. 
Now  we  will  prove  one  of  the  two  inequalities  at  the  start  of  this  lecture.  Recall  from 
� �2 �

the  proof  of  the  Cacciopolli  inequality  last  time  that  if  u  is  L  harmonic  on  B2r  then
