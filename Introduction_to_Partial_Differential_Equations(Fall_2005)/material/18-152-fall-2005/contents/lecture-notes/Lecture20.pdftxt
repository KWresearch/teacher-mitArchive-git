Holder  continuity  of  Harmonic  functions 

In  this  lecture  we  will  show  that  harmonic  functions  need  to  have  a  degree  of  regularity, 
speciﬁcally  they must  be  Holder  continuous. 

Theorem  1.1  Let  L  be  a  uniformly  el liptic  operator  in  divergence  form  taking

If  u  : Rn  R  is  an  L  harmonic  function  then  u  is  holder  continuous. 
The  proof  is  a  little  involved,  so  we  will  ﬁrst  give  a  sketch  of  the  proof,  and  then  go  back 
Proof  Pick  x0  ∈ Rn ,  and  deﬁne  the  operator  �L  by 
to  ﬁll  in  the  details.  The  aim  is  to  use Morrey’s  lemma.

so  that  2c1 τ α−γ  = 1  and  we  have 
φ(τ k s) ≤ τ kγ φ(s).

like  to  α  (though  the  constant  will  become  nastier).
