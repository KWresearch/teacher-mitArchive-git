Solving  the Laplace  equation  in R2 :  The Dirichlet  problem


In  this  lecture  we  will  study  something  called  the  Dirichlet  problem  for  discs  in  R2 . 
Given  a  continuous  function  f  on  the  boundary  of  a  disc  Br  we  will  try  to  construct  a 
harmonic  function  u  on  the  entire  disc  so  that  f  and u  agree  on  ∂Br .  This  turns  out  to  be 
a  lot  easier  in  polar  coordinates.

The  ﬁrst  problem  is  to  calculate  the  laplacian  in  polar  coordinates.  If  u  : R2  R,  then

∂ r2 
r2  ∂ θ2
r  ∂ r 
This is a straightforward consequence of the chain rule, but the calculation is rather tedious. 
Now  look  for  harmonic  functions  of  the  form  u(r, θ) = g(r)h(θ).  Plug  this  into  (1)  and

The  ﬁrst  two  terms  depend  only  on  radius,  and  the  last  term  depends  only  on  θ ,  so 
both must  be  constant.  We  have

but  h  has  to  be  periodic  with  period  2π .  This  immediately  excludes  the  possibility  that 
c > 0, and if c = 0 we need h to be constant.  It also restricts the possibilities  if c < 0, when 
we need  c = −k2  for  some  integer k .  Our  solutions  are h  constant  or h = a cos kθ + b sin kθ 
for  some  integer  k . 
Solving  (5)  is  a  little  trickier.  First  we’ll  deal  with  the  case  c = 0.  Then  we  get 
rg ��  + g �  = 0 
This  is  a  ﬁrst  order  equation  in  g’  which  we  can  solve  to  get  g �  =  r  ,  so  g  = a0  + a1  log r . 
a1
In  order  for  g  to  be  well  deﬁned  at  the  origin  we  need  a1  =  0,  so  if  c  =  0  then  the  only 
solutions  are  constants. 
Now  deal with  c = 0.  From  above we  need  c = −k2 .  We’ll  try  for  solutions  of  the  form 
g = rm .  Plugging  this  into  (5)  we  get 
r m (m  − k2 ) = 0,

(6) 
so we  need m = ±k ,  and  g(r) = a0 rk + a1 r−k .  Once  again we  need  a1  = 0  so  that  g  is well 
deﬁned  at  the  origin.  Together  with  our  solution  for  h  we  have  u  constant  or 

v = 

u(r, θ) = r k (a cos kθ + b sin kθ)

for  some  integer  k .  Since  the  sum  of  any  collection  of  harmonic  functions  is  still  harmonic

we  also  get  solutions  of  the  form

r k (ak  cos kθ + bk  sin kθ).

We  have  found  lots  of  harmonic  functions  on  R2 ,  and  we  can  now  solve  the  Dirichlet 
problem  fairly  easily.  Take  a  continuous  function  f  on  the  boundary  of  a  disc BR .  We  can

expand  f  as  a  fourier  series,  so

k=0 rk (R−k ck  cos kθ + R−k dk  sin kθ).  Then  v  is  harmonic  on  BR ,  and  v  =  f 
on  the  boundary  as  required.  It  turns  out  that  all  harmonic  equations  on  the  disc  are  of 
this  form.  This  follows  immediately from the  fact that two harmonic  functions which agree 
on  the  boundary  agree  over  the  entire  set.
