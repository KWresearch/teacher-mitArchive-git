Finishing  the  proof 

In  order  to  ﬁnish  the  proof  from  last  time  we  need  a  lemma. 
Lemma  1.1  Let  φ  be  a  positive  and  increasing  function  on  the  positive  reals,  and  let  α, c 
��  �α 
� 
be  positive  constants.  For  al l  0 < γ < α  there  is  � > 0  such  that 
r 
φ(r) ≤ c

for  0 < r < s  implies 

φ(r) ≤ c�

for  some  constant  c� . 
Proof  Choose  0 < τ  < 1  such  that  � ≤ τ α .  Then 
φ(τ s) ≤ c(τ α  + �)φ(s) ≤ 2cτ αφ(s). 

Therefore 

φ(τ k s) ≤ (2cτ α )k φ(s). 
Pick  γ  so  that  2cτ α−γ  ≤ 1  and  we  have 

) ≤ τ kγ φ(s
φ(τ k s
).

When  r  =  τ k s  this  is  precisely  what  we  wanted  with  c�  =  1.  If  instead  τ k+1s ≤  r  ≤  τ k s 
1 � r �γ 
then 
φ(r) ≤ φ(τ k s) ≤ τ kγ φ(s) ≤ 
s 
τ
which  is  what  we  needed.  Note  that  by  taking  τ  very  small  we  can  get  γ  as  close  to  α as 
we  like.

Now  we  apply  this  to  what  we  were  doing  last  time.  Let  φ(r) =  Br (x0 )  |�u| .  We  showed

that 
r  n 
ij  − Aij (x

φ(r) ≤

φ(s) 
s 
By  picking  s we  can  get  ||Aij  − Aij (x0 )||  as  small  as we  like  so we will  be  able  to  apply 
our  lemma.  Pick  0 < β < 1  and  set  γ = n − 2 + 2β .  By  our  lemma  there  is  a  constant  k �

and  Holder  continuity  follows  by Morrey’s  lemma.
