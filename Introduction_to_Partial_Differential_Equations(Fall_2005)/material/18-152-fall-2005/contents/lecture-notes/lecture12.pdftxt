The Heat  equation.[t1  > t2 ]


We’ve  spent  a  lot  of  time  concentrating  on  the  laplace  equation,  but  there  are  other 
important  PDE’s.  One  example  is  the  heat  equation,  which  we  will  study  in  this  lecture. 
Consider  a  function  u  : Rn  × R
→ 
R  of  both  time  and  space.  The  heat  equation  is 

∂u 
�u = 
. 
∂ t 
In  this  lecture  we  will  prove  a  gradient  estimate  and  a  Harnack  inequality  for  functions 
satisfying  the  heat  equation  on  a  torus T n  = S 1 × S 1 × · · · × S 1  ,  since  this  turns  out  to  be 
easier  than  doing  the  proof  for  a  ball.

Now  work  on  Ft .  Clearly

Ft  = |�f |2  − ft  + t(2�f  · �ft ) − tftt .

A  Harnack  inequality  for  a  torus 
Now we’ll try to get a Harnack inequality out of this.  Pick (x1 , t1 ) and (x2 , t2 ) with t2  ≥ t1 , 
and  let η(t) = (x2 , t2 ) + t((x1 , t1 ) − (x2 , t2 )) be  the  straight  line path  from one  to  the other. 
Then

f (x1 , t1 ) − f (x2 , t2 ) =

Together  with  (13)  we  get 

f (x1 , t1 ) − f (x2 , t2 ) ≤ 

|�f ||x2  − x1 | − |�f |2 (t2  − t1 ) + 

Calculate  df (η)  = �f  · (x1  − x2 ) + ft (t1  − t2 ).  By  inequality  (12)
