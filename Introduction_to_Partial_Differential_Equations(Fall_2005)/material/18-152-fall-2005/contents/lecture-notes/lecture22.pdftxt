In  this  lecture  we  will  complete  the  proof  of  the  mean  value  inequality.  Last  time  we  had 
c˜
((u − h)+ )2 
((u − k)+ )2  ≤
(R − r)2 (k − h)4/n

Ar,k 
for  all  h < k  and  r < R.  Deﬁne  rm  = 1 + 2−m  and  km  = (2 − 2−m )k  for  some  constant  k . 
Applying  the  above  inequality  to  rm , rm+1 , km , km+1  gives

Deﬁne  φ(m) =  Arm ,km 
φ(m + 1) ≤

and  � = 2/n,  so

Substituting  for  rm , km  and  renaming  c =

Now  use  induction  to  show  that  φ(n)  → 0  as  n  → ∞.  Suppose  there  is  some  constant

Note  that  lim rm  = 1,  and  lim km  = 2k so  we  get

and  conclude  that  u ≤ 2k on  B1 .  Putting  in  our  value  for  k we  obtain
