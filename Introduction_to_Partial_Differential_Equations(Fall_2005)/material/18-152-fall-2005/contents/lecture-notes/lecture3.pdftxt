Lecture  Three:  The  Hopf  Maximum  Principle 

In  this  lecture  we  will  state  and  prove  the  Hopf Maximum  Principle. 
Theorem  1.1  If  u  is  an  harmonic  function  on  the  closure  of  Br (0) ⊂ Rn ,  and  x0  on  the 
boundary  of  Br (0)  is  a  strict  maximum  of  u  (ie  u(x0 ) > u(y)  for  al l  y =�  x0 )  then 
∂u 
(x0 ) ≥ 
(u(x0 ) − u(0))

for  some  strictly  positive  dimensional  constant  k .

Proof  We  prove  this  from  the  maximum  principle.  First  consider  the  case  r  =  1.  Let 
v(x) = e−α|x|2  − e−α ,  so  v = 0  on  ∂B1 (0)  and  v > 0  on  the  interior.  Deﬁne 
w  : Rn  −→ R  by  w(x) =  x|
|

and 

f  : R −→ R  by  f (t) = e−αt  − e−α 

so  that  v = f (w).  Now  consider 

� f (w) = 
f �� (w)|� w| 
2  + f � (w)� w

Picking  α = 4n  and  restricting  v  to  1 ≥  x ≥ 1/2  we  obtain

Now  apply  this  to  u.  On  the  annulus  B1  \ B1/2

�(u + �v) = ��v > 0, 
(2) 
so  u + �v  is  sub­harmonic  on  this  anulus,  and  the  maximum  principle  applies.  Therefore 
the  maximum  of  u + �v  on  the  annulus  B1  \ B1/2  occurs  on  the  boundary.  Recall  that  u 
has  a  strict  maximum  on  the  outer  boundary,  so  if  we  choose  �  very  small  we  can  arrange 
that  u + �v  also  takes  it’s  maximum  on  the  outer  boundary.  For  this  we  need 
u(x0 ) + �v(x0 ) ≥ max∂B1/2 (u(x) + �v(x)) 

so  that 

We  can  choose 

u(x0 ) ≥ max∂B1/2 u(x) + �(e−n  − e−4n ). 
u(x0 ) − max∂B1/2 u(x) 
. 
2(e−n  − e−4n ) 
We  know  that  u + �v  has  a  maximum  on  the  outer  boundary  and  it  has  to  be  at  x0 
(since  v = 0  on  the  outer  boundary).  It  follows  that 
∂ (u + �v)  ≥ 0

∂n 
Finally  we  apply  the  Harnack  inequality  to  get  this  in  terms  of  u(0).  Deﬁne  w(x)  by 
w(x) =  u(x0 ) − u(x).  Note  that  w  is  harmonic  and  non­negative,  therefore  the  Harnack 
inequality  holds,  and  we  get 
w(0) ≤ maxB1/2 (0)w(x) ≤ C (n)minB1/2 (0)w(x) 
for  an  appropriate  dimensional  constant  C (n).  Therefore 
u(x0 ) − u(0)  ≤ (u(x0 ) − maxB1/2 (0)u(x)).

Substituting  this  into  (4)  we  obtain

This completes the proof for r = 1.  We will get the general case by scaling.  If u is harmonic 
u  is harmonic on B1 (0).  Also  if x0  ∈ ∂Br (0)  is a 
on Br (0) and we deﬁne  ˜
u(y) = u(ry)  then  ˜
strict maximum  of  u  then  ˜
x0  = x0/r  is  a  strict maximum  of  ˜
