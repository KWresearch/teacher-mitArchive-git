Lecture One:  Harmonic Functions and the Harnack Inequality 

1  The  Laplacian 
→
Let  Ω  be  an  open  subset  of  Rn ,  and  let  u  :  Ω  R  be  a  smooth  function.  We  deﬁne  the 
n� ∂ 2u 
Laplacian  by 
2 . 
∂xi 
i=1 

�u = 

(1) 

The  equation 

�u = 0 
(2) 
is  called  the  Laplace  equation,  and  functions  which  satisfy  it  are  said  to  be  harmonic. 
Harmonic functions turn out to be very  important, and much of this course will be devoted 
to  their  study.  Also  of  interest  are  functions  with  non­negative  or  non­positive  laplacian. 
These  are  termed  sub­ and  super­harmonic  respectively. 

2  The  Maximum  principle 

The maximum  principle  is  simply  the  statement  that  the  gradient  of  a  function  at  a max­
¯
imum  is  zero.  Formally,  if  u  is  a  twice  diﬀerentiable  function  on  a  closed  ball  Br (x)  with 
a maximum  at  x,  then 

�u = 0  at  x  and �u ≤ 0  at  x. 
The  one  dimensional  case  should  be  familiar,  and  proofs  of  other  cases  are  analogous.

3  Dirichlet  Energy 
Recall  that  the Dirichlet energy of a  function v  : Ω → R  is given by  Ω  |�v | .  We will  show 
2
that  harmonic  functions  correspond  to  critical  points  of  Dirichlet  energy.  For  ﬁxed  v  and 
� 
for  any  φ ∈ C∞ (Ω)  (i.e.  φ  an  inﬁnitely  diﬀerentiable  real  valued  function  on  Ω)  we  deﬁne

Since  φ  = 0  on  ∂Ω,  it  is  clear  that  ∂Ω φ�v  · dS  =  0.  Applying  Stokes’  theorem  to  this

The  Mean  Value  Property 

The  following  property  of  harmonic  properties  turns  out  to  be  very  useful 
Theorem  4.1  Let  x  ∈  Rn  and  take  Br0 (x)  a  bal l  around  x.  If  u  is  a  harmonic  function 
� 
on  Br0 (x)  then

This  is  simply  saying  that  the  derivative  of  the  average  of  u  is  the  average  of  the  outward 
normal  derivative.  Using  this  we  can  calculate

vol  ∂Br (x)  ∂Br (x) 
for  super­harmonic  u.  One  consequence  of  the  mean  value  property  is  the  following. 
Corollary  4.2  If  x  ∈  Rn  and  u  is  a  harmonic  function  on  Br (x)  then  u  takes  both  it’s 
maximum  and  it’s  minimum  value  on  the  boundary  ∂Br (x). 

u  and  u(x) ≥ 

u(x) ≥

u

(14)

Proof  If  u  has  no  interior  maximum  then  it’s  maximum  must  be  on  the  boundary,  and 
we’re done.  Else take y  an interior maximum, and set c = u(y).  By the maximum principle 
c  is  the  average  of  u  over  any  sphere  surrounding  y .  Since  y  is  a  maximum  we  also  have 
u  ≤  c  on  each  of  these  spheres,  and  we  conclude  that  u  =  c  on  each  sphere.  Now  take  a 
sphere  that  intersects  with  the  boundary,  and  u  takes  it’s  maximum  on  this  intersection. 
The  argument  for  the minimum  is  similar. 

By  a  very  similar  argument  we  can  extend  this  result  to  shapes  other  than  spheres,  show 
that  subharmonic  functions  take  their  maximum  on  the  boundary,  and  show  that  super­
harmonic  functions  take  they’re minimum  on  the  boundary.

5  Harnack  Inequality 

Another  useful  property  of  harmonic  functions  is  the  Harnack  inequality. 
Theorem  5.1  Let  B2r (0)  be  an  open  bal l  in  Rn .  There  is  a  constant  C  depending  only  on 
the  dimension  n  such  that 

(15) 

sup  u ≤ C  inf  u. 
Br (0) 
Br (0) 
for  al l  functions  u  that  are  non­negative  and  harmonic  on  B2r (0). 
Proof  Pick  x, y  ∈ Br (0).  We  must  show  that  u(x) ≤  C u(y).  Let  d ≤  2r  be  the  distance 
between x  and  y ,  and pick w  and  z  one  and  two  thirds  of  the way  from x  to  y  respectively. 
Note  that  u  is  positive  and  harmonic  on  Br (x)  and  that  Br/3 (w)  ⊂  Br (x).  By  the  mean 
value  property  we  have 
� 
1 
� 
vol  Br/3 (w)  Br/3 (w) 
3n 
� 
vol  Br (x)  Br/3 (w) 
3n 
≤ 
vol  Br (x)  Br (x) 
≤  3n u(x). 

u(w)  = 

= 

u

u

u

By  a  similar  calculation  we  compare  w, z  and  z , y  to  get 
u(x) ≤ 33n u(y) 

as  required. 

(16) 

This is a very powerful result about harmonic functions, with several consequences.  For 
example,  if  we  have  u ≥  0  and  �u =  0  on  B2r (0)  and  inf Br (0) u =  0,  then  u  is  identically 
0  on  Br (0).  In  fact,  by  modifying  the  above  argument,  we  can  obtain  a  similar  result  for 
any  radius  s < 2r .
