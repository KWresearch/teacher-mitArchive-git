(1)  Use  ﬁrst  and  second  moments  in  the  method  of  moments  to  ﬁnd  an 
� 
estimate  of  θ in  the  uniform  distribution  U [0, θ]  with  p.d.f. 
,  when  0 ≤ x ≤ θ, 
f (x|θ) =	
1 
θ 
0,  otherwise, 
where  0 < θ < ∞. Compare  these  two  estimates  by  computing  their  asymp-
totic  variances. 
(2)  Find MLE  of  the  parameter  λ for  Poisson  distribution  Π(λ). 
(3)  Find MLE  of  the  parameter  α for  exponential  distribution  E (α).

(4) Consider  a parametric  family of distributions with  the p.d.f.  given by 
eθ−x ,  when  x ≥ θ,
f (x|θ) = 
0,  when  x < θ, 
and where  −∞ < θ < ∞. Find MLE  of  θ for  this  family. 
(5) Consider  a parametric  family of distributions with  the p.d.f.  given by 
f (x|θ) =  e
for  − ∞ < x <∞ ,
1  −|x−θ |
2 
where  −∞	 < θ  <  ∞.  Find  MLE  of  θ  for  this  family.  (Hint:  see  Theorem 
4.5.1  in  the  book.)
