(1)  Find  suﬃcient  statistic  for  gamma  distribution  Γ(α, β ),  where  the 
value  of  β  is  known  and  the  value  of  α  is  unknown. 
(2)  Consider  a  family  of  distributions  with  p.d.f.  given  by 
f (x|θ) = a(θ)b(x)e c(θ)d(x) 

- the  so  called  exponential  family  of  distributions.  Given  an  i.i.d.  sample 
X1 , . . . , Xn  with  distribution  from  this  family,  ﬁnd  suﬃcient  statistic. 
(3) Find jointly suﬃcient  statistics for gamma distribution Γ(α, β ), where 
now  both  β  and  α  are  unknown. 
(4)  Suppose  that  we  have  an  i.i.d.  sample  X1 , . . . , Xn  from  exponential 
distribution  E (α) with  α  unknown.  Is  the  MLE  of  α  a  minimal  suﬃcient 
statistic? 
(5) Consider an i.i.d.  sample X1 , . . . , Xn  from uniform distribution U [0, θ] 
and  let 

Y

n  = max(X1 , . . . , Xn ). 
Find  the  estimate  of  unknown  θ  of  the  form  cYn  that minimizes  the  squared 
error  loss 
θ (cYn  −  θ)2  .
