(1) Compute Fisher  information I (λ)  for a  random variable with Poisson 
distribution  Π(λ). 
(2) Compute  Fisher  information  I (α)  for  a  random  variable with  normal 
distribution N (α, σ2), assuming that σ2  is a known constant (this means that 
α  is  the  only  parameter  of  the  distribution). 
(3)  Show  that  Bernoulli  distribution  B (p)  is  an  exponential-type  distri-
bution.  Using  this  fact,  ﬁnd  an  eﬃcient  estimate  of  p. 
(4)  Show  that  normal  distribution  N (α, σ2)  with  given  σ2  (this  means 
you  can  assume  that  σ2  is  a  known  constant,  and α  is  the  only  parameter  of 
the distribution)  is an  exponential-type  distribution.  Using  this  fact,  ﬁnd  an 
eﬃcient  estimate  of  α.
