(4)  Consider  two  hypotheses,  null  hypothesis  H1  and  alternative  hypoth­
esis  H2  : 

H1  :  the  distribution  P  is  Bernoulli  with  probability  of  success  p = 0.2, 

H2  :  the  distribution  P  is  Bernoulli  with  probability  of  success  p = 0.4. 
Given   two   observations   X1 , X2  construct  the  most  powerful  test  of  size  α1  = 
0.05. Compute  the  power  of this  test. 
(5)  Suppose  that  we  have  ten  observations  X1 , . . . , X10  from   a   normal  
distribution  for  which  the  mean  µ  is  unknown  and  the  variance  σ2  is  4. 
Given  two  simple  hypotheses 
H1  :  µ = 1, H2  :  µ =  −1 

ﬁnd  the  most  powerful  test  δ  with   type   1   error   α1 (δ ) = 0.05.  Compute  the 
power   of   this   test.
