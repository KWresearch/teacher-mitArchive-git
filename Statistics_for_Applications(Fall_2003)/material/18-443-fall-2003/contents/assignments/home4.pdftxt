(1)  (5.10,  No.  9)  A  manufacturer  believes  that  defective  products  are 
produced  with  unknown  probability  p,  which  will  be  modeled  as  having  a 
beta  distribution.  The  manufacturer  thinks  that  p  should  be  around  0.05, 
but  if  the  ﬁrst  10  observed  products  were  all  defective,  the mean  of  p  would 
rise  to  0.9.  Find  the  beta  distribution  that  has  these  properties. 
(2)  (6.2,  No.  2)  Suppose  the  proportion  p  of  defective  items  in  a  large 
manufactured  lot  is  known  to  be  either  0.1 or  0.2,  and  the  prior  p.f.  of  p  is 
as  follows: 

ξ (0.1) = 0.7 and  ξ (0.2) = 0.3. 

Suppose also  that when  eight  items  are selected  at  random  from the  lot,  it  is 
found  that  exactly  two  of  them  are  defective.  Determine  the  posterior  p.f.of 
p. 

(3)  (6.2,  No.  4)  Suppose  that  the  prior  of  some  parameter  θ  is  a  gamma 
distribution  for  which  the  mean  is  10  and  the  variance  is  5.  Determine  the 
prior  p.d.f.  of  θ. 
(4)  (6.3,  No.  12)  Suppose  that  the  time  in  minutes  required  to  serve 
a  customer  at  a  certain  facility  has  exponential  distribution  E (α) with  α 
unknown  and  the  prior  of  α  is  a  gamma  distribution  with mean  0.2 and  the 
standard  deviation  1.  If  the  average  time  required  to  serve  a  sample  of  20 
customers  is  3.8 minutes,  what  is  the  posterior  distribution  of  α. 
(5)  (6.4,  No.  2)  Suppose  that  a  proportion  p  of  defective  items  in  a 
large  shipment  is  unknown,  and  the  prior  of  p  is  beta  distribution  with  the 
parameters α = 5, β  = 10. Suppose that 20 items are selected at random from 
the  shipment,  and  that  exactly  one  of  these  items  is  found  to  be  defective. 
If  the  squared  error  loss  function  is  used,  what  is  the  Bayes  estimate  of  p? 
(6)  (6.4, No.  5)  Suppose  that  the  number  of  defects  in  a  roll  of magnetic 
recording  tape has Poisson  distribution Π(λ) with  λ unknown,  and  the  prior 
of λ is a gamma distribution with parameters α = 3, β  = 1. On ﬁve randomly 
selected  rolls the numbers of defects were to be 2, 2, 6, 0, 3. If the squared  loss 
function  is  used  what  is  the  Bayes  estimate  of  λ?
