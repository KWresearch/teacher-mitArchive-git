***** Textbook *****
[Amazon_logo] DeGroot, Morris H., andÂ Mark J. Schervish. Probability and
Statistics. 3rd ed. Pearson Addison Wesley.
***** Prerequisites *****
Probability and Random Variables (18.440) or Probabilistic Systems Analysis
(6.041).
***** Course Outline *****
We will cover parts of Chapters 6-10 (estimation, sampling distributions of
estimators, testing hypotheses, categorical data and non-parametric methods,
and linear statistical models). Necessary facts from probability will be
recalled throughout the course. Some lectures will not be limited to the
textbook, so attendance is important.
***** Course Description *****
This course provides a broad treatment of statistics, concentrating on specific
statistical techniques used in science and industry.
***** Topics *****
**** Estimation Theory ****
    * Estimates by method of moments, their properties;
    * Maximum likelihood estimates, their properties, Fisher information, Rao-
      Cramer inequality, efficient estimates;
    * Bayes estimates, prior and posterior distributions, conjugate priors;
    * Sufficient and jointly sufficient statistics, Neyman-Fisher factorization
      criterion, Rao-Blackwell theorem;
    * Estimates for parameters of normal distribution, their properties;
    * Chi-square, Fisher and Student distributions, confidence intervals for
      parameters of normal distribution.
**** Hypotheses Testing ****
    * Testing simple hypotheses, Bayes decision rules, types of error, most
      powerful tests, likelihood ratio tests, randomized tests;
    * Composite hypotheses, power function, monotone likelihood ratio and
      uniformly most powerful tests;
    * t-tests and F-tests;
    * Goodness-of-fit tests, chi-square tests, tests of independence and
      homogeneity, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
**** Regression and Classification ****
    * Simple linear regression, least-squares fit, statistical inference in
      simple linear regression, confidence intervals, prediction intervals;
    * Classification problem, boosting algorithm.
