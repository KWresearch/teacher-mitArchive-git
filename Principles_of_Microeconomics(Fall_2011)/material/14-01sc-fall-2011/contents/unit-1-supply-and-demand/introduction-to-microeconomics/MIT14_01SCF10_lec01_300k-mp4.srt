10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,570
PROFESSOR: So what I want to
do today is I want to talk

11
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,930
about what the heck
this course is.

12
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,560
What is microeconomics?

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,080
What are you going to be
learning in this course?

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,150
And just, sort of, set us
up for the semester.

15
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,720
OK.

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,400
So basically, microeconomics
is all about scarcity.

17
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:43,470
It's all about how individuals
and firms make decisions given

18
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,410
that we live in a world
of scarcity.

19
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,540
Scarcity is key because
basically what we're going to

20
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,860
learn about this semester in
various shapes and forms is a

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,480
lot of different types of
constrained optimization.

22
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,320

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,530
We're going to learn a lot
about different ways that

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,890
individuals make choices
in a world of scarcity.

25
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,060
OK?

26
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,550
That is, this course is going
to be about trade-offs.

27
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,240
Given scarce resources, how
the individuals and firms

28
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,760
trade off different alternatives
to make

29
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,150
themselves as well-off
as possible.

30
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,790
That's why economics is called
the dismal science.

31
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:25,250
OK?

32
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,740
It's called the dismal science
because we are not about

33
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,910
everyone have everything.

34
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,710
We're always the people who
say, no, you can't have

35
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,090
everything.

36
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,750
You have to make a trade-off.

37
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,190
OK?

38
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,040
You have to give
up x to get y.

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,810
And that's why people
don't like us.

40
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,380
OK?

41
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,050
Because that's why we're called
the dismal science,

42
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,250
because we're always
pointing out the

43
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,870
trade-offs that people face.

44
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,640
Now, some may call it dismal,
but I call it fun.

45
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,640
And that may be because of my
MIT training, as I said I was

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,360
an undergraduate here.

47
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,190
In fact, MIT is the perfect
place to teach microeconomics

48
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,500
because this whole institute is
about engineering solutions

49
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,850
which are really ultimately
about constrained

50
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,060
optimization.

51
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,790
Indeed, what's the best
example in the

52
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,600
world we have of this?

53
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,360
It's the 270 contest. Right?

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,090
You're given a pile of junk,
you've got to build something

55
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,480
that does something else.

56
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,780
That's an exercise in
constrained optimization.

57
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,070
All engineering is really
constrained optimization.

58
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,800
How do you take the resources
you're given and do the best

59
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,280
job building something.

60
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,650
And that's really what
microeconomics is.

61
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,900
Just like 270 is not a dismal
contest, microeconomics is not

62
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,720
to me a dismal science.

63
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,490
You could think of this
course like 270.

64
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,775
But instead of the building
robots, we're

65
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:29,180
running people's lives.

66
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:29,720
OK?

67
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,650
That's, kind of, the
way I like to

68
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,230
think about this course.

69
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,840
Instead of trying to decide how
we can build something to

70
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,140
move a ping pong ball across a
table, we're trying to decide

71
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,510
how people make their decisions
to consume, and

72
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,270
firms make their decisions
to produce.

73
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,660
That's basically what's going
to go on in this class.

74
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,140
OK?

75
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,960
And that's why basically modern
microeconomics was

76
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,360
founded at MIT in the 1950s
by Paul Samuelson.

77
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,890
The father of modern economics
was a professor here, and he

78
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,080
basically founded the field.

79
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,240
He basically introduced
mathematics to economics.

80
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,690
And through teaching this
course, 14.01, 50, 60 years

81
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,210
ago, actually developed the
field that we now study.

82
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,990
Now, what we're going to do in
this class, is focused on two

83
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,450
types of actors in the economy:

84
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,330
consumers and producers.

85
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:19,910

86
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,730
OK?

87
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,300
And we are going to build models
of how consumers and

88
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,500
producers behave. Now,
technically, a model is going

89
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,230
to be a description of any
relationship between two or

90
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,180
more economic variables.

91
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,950
OK?

92
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,460
That's a model.

93
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,090
A description of any
relationship between two or

94
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,120
more economic variables.

95
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,430
The trick with economics, and
the reason many of you will be

96
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,870
frustrated during the semester,
is that unlike the

97
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,970
modern relationship between
say energy and mass these

98
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,600
models are never precise.

99
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,490
They are never accurate
to the 10th decimal.

100
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,630
OK?

101
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,950
This is not a precise,
scientific

102
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,190
relationship with modeling.

103
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,390
We'll be making a number of
simplifying assumptions that

104
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,650
allow us to capture the main
tendencies in the data.

105
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,850
That allow us to capture the
main insights into how

106
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,000
individuals make consumption
decisions and how firms make

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,240
production decisions.

108
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,390
But it's not going to be as
clean and precise as the kind

109
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,890
of proofs you're going to be
doing in some of your other

110
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,450
classes in freshman and
sophomore year.

111
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,130
OK?

112
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,180
So basically, we have a trade
off with the simplifying

113
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,480
assumptions.

114
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,720
On the one hand, obviously we
want a model that can explain

115
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,600
reality as much as possible.

116
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,280
If a model can't explain
reality, it's not useful.

117
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,250
On the other hand, we need a
model that's tractable, a

118
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,810
model that I can teach you
in a lecture or less.

119
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,100
OK?

120
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,200
And basically, what we do is we
make a lot of simplifying

121
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,730
assumptions in this class to
make those models work.

122
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,580
And yet, what we'll find is
despite these assumptions,

123
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,270
we'll come up with incredibly
powerful predictions of how

124
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,940
consumers and producers
behave.

125
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,260
So with consumers what we're
going to do is, we're going to

126
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,010
say that consumers are
constrained by their limited

127
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,030
wealth or what we'll call
their budget constraint.

128
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,930
And subject to that constraint
they choose the set of goods

129
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,250
that makes them as well
off as possible.

130
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:12,760
OK?

131
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,970
That's what we're going to call
utility maximization.

132
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,000
We'll say the consumers maximize
their utility,

133
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,600
consumers are going to maximize
utility subject to a

134
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,800
budget constraint.

135
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,680
That's going to be what
we're going to develop

136
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,460
the consumer decision.

137
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,583
They have some utility function
which is going to be

138
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,600
a model of their preferences.

139
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
OK?

140
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,790
So I'm going to propose to take
everything you love in

141
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,220
life and write it down
as a u function.

142
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:40,920
OK?

143
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,716
Then I'm going to propose you
take all the resources at your

144
00:05:42,716 --> 00:05:44,900
disposal, write them down as a
budget constraint and then I

145
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,760
just do constrained maximization
to solve for how

146
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,580
you make decisions.

147
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,310
Firms, on the other hand, are
going to maximize profits.

148
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,960

149
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,100
Pi is profits.

150
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,200
Firms are going to
maximize profits.

151
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,360
Their goal is to make as much
profit as possible, to earn as

152
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,030
much money as possible.

153
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:05,880
OK?

154
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,960
However, that's going to be
subject to both the demands of

155
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,620
consumers, we get to firms it's
a lot harder, subject to

156
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:22,850
both consumer demand
and input costs.

157
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,740
So firms have to consider,
consumers have to consider

158
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,310
look what does stuff cost
and what do I like,

159
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,290
I'll make my decision.

160
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,900
Firms is a little more
complicated.

161
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,200
They've go to consider, what do
consumers want and how do I

162
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,640
make what they want?

163
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,895
So they've got to consider both
the output side, what a

164
00:06:36,895 --> 00:06:39,050
consumer is going to want me to
make and what's it going to

165
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,880
cost me to produce that good?

166
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,880
And how do I combine those
to make the most profits?

167
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,700
OK?

168
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:50,650
So from these assumptions, we
will be able to answer the

169
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,790
three fundamental questions
of microeconomics.

170
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,380
OK?

171
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,650
The three fundamental questions
of microeconomics

172
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:04,485
will be, what goods and services
should be produced?

173
00:07:04,485 --> 00:07:07,800

174
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,440
What goods and services
should be produced?

175
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,960

176
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,760
How to produce those
goods and services?

177
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:20,920

178
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,250
And who gets the goods
and services?

179
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,400

180
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,400
What goods and services
get produced?

181
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,090
How to produce those
goods and services?

182
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,290
And who gets them?

183
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,150
And what's amazing, we'll learn
in this course, is that

184
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,980
all three of these questions,
the three fundamental

185
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,990
questions that drive our entire
economy, are all solved

186
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,460
through the role of
one key state

187
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,825
variable, which is prices.

188
00:07:48,825 --> 00:07:52,080

189
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,820
Prices in the economy resolve
all of these problems. OK?

190
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,810
Consumers and firms will
interact in a market, they'll

191
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,800
interact in a marketplace.

192
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,330
And out of that marketplace will
emerge a set of prices,

193
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,020
in a way we'll describe.

194
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,460
And those prices will allow
firms and consumers to make

195
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,063
the relevant decisions.

196
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:16,870
OK?

197
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,080
So let me just give you one, and
we're going to do all this

198
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,900
rigorously throughout the
semester, let me just start

199
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,050
with one casual example.

200
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:22,650
OK?

201
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,600
Let's think about the
development of the iPod.

202
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,070
OK?

203
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,830
Let's cast our minds way back,
lo way back to the development

204
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,760
of the iPod.

205
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,380
OK?

206
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:37,350
Now, when Apple was thinking
about making the iPod, they

207
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,750
had to ask, would consumers
want this?

208
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,430
So consumers had to decide given
their limited resources,

209
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,040
given the fact that they were
buying a certain set of things

210
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,560
would they be willing to forsake
some things they were

211
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,600
already doing to spend the
money on the iPod?

212
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:52,890
OK?

213
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,110
It was a non-trivial
amount of money.

214
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,413
Would they be willing to
forsake things they are

215
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:56,530
already doing?

216
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,340
OK?

217
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,760
To spend money on the iPod.

218
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,500
And clearly they were.

219
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,960
Clearly, consumers were willing
to spend money, to

220
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,470
spend a lot of money,
to get an iPod.

221
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,590
They were originally
what? $300 Back

222
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,040
when $300 meant something.

223
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,650
OK.

224
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:16,760
So basically, what the firm will
do is they'll say, OK, we

225
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,800
get a signal from the consumer
that they're willing to pay

226
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,620
money to get the iPod.

227
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,910
They're willing to pay a high
price to get the iPod.

228
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,850
Now, the firm will say, well,
should we make iPods?

229
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,000
Well, that will depend on what
it cost to make them.

230
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,100
So we have to then assess what
are the inputs that we'll need

231
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,310
to make an iPod?

232
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:44,070
Well, to do that we have to
look at the prices of the

233
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,550
various inputs that we'll need,
of the chip in them and

234
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,130
the metal and all the other
stuff that goes into the iPod.

235
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,020
OK?

236
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,610
So they can shop across
different countries, to

237
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,170
different kinds of chips, they
can look at different kinds of

238
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,560
monitors, et cetera.

239
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,820
But, once again, what they'll
do is they'll use the prices

240
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,290
of those different inputs
to decide how

241
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,430
to produce the iPod.

242
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,630
So whether to produce the iPod
will depend on the price

243
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,030
people are willing
to pay for it.

244
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,850
How to make the iPod will depend
on the prices that

245
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,870
firms have to pay for the chip
and the casing and all the

246
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,420
other things that go
into the iPod.

247
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,280
OK?

248
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,400
And then finally, who's
going to get the iPod?

249
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,500
Well, they're going to make
a certain amount.

250
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,510
What decided who gets them?

251
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,170
Well, the person who gets them
are the people who are willing

252
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,610
to pay the price that Apple
decides to charge.

253
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,140
Some people are willing to pay
that price, they're going to

254
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,940
get an iPod.

255
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,400
Some people are not willing to
pay that price, they will not

256
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,910
get an iPod.

257
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,460
So the price in the market will
ultimately decide who

258
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,030
gets the iPod, as well.

259
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,710
OK?

260
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,710
So basically, prices will
determine what gets produced,

261
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,880
how it's produced,
and who gets the

262
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,000
goods that are produced.

263
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,280
OK?

264
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,850
Of course, this is a very, very
simplified example, as

265
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,900
you can already tell.

266
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,610
There are lots of cases
where prices don't

267
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,070
decide these things.

268
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,590
So my favorite example is the
fact that there are lines for

269
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,190
hours to get tickets to see
a Lady Gaga concert.

270
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,030
OK?

271
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,040
Now if it's really true that
prices determine everything,

272
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,740
we shouldn't see any lines.

273
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,650
It should just be that those
who are willing to pay the

274
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,730
most to see Lady Gaga should.

275
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,220
Those who want the most
to get Lady Gaga

276
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,120
should get the tickets.

277
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,990
Those who aren't willing to pay
shouldn't get the tickets.

278
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,420
Why should there be a line?

279
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,000
Not to mention the fact that
people shouldn't be willing to

280
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,660
pay anything, but that's
a different issue.

281
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,510
That's a taste issue.

282
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,770
We'll come to taste later.

283
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,610
OK?

284
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,010
So basically, clearly this
is not working perfectly.

285
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,060
If the world worked in the way
I just described, then what

286
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,870
should happen is there should be
essentially an auction and

287
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,140
whoever is willing to pay the
most for Lady Gaga tickets

288
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,270
would get them.

289
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,500
And whoever is not willing
to pay wouldn't.

290
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,560
It wouldn't involve
any waiting in

291
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,850
line or other things.

292
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,440
Now, what's very interesting
is we've actually seen an

293
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,910
evolution from my youth to
your youth towards the

294
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,840
economic model.

295
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,660
When I was a kid, if you wanted,
so then it was Cars

296
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:09,710
tickets, OK, to date myself, OK,
you had to go and camp out

297
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,050
at 3:00 in the morning outside
the store where they're

298
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,700
selling them to get
the tickets.

299
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,440
Now, of course, you don't
do that anymore.

300
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,800
Now you go on Stub Hub or
Ticketmaster or these other

301
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,870
secondary sellers and there
there are prices that

302
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,380
determine it.

303
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:28,060
So how many people have
waited on line to

304
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,750
get a concert ticket?

305
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,390
That's amazing.

306
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,620
So if I asked this question 30
years ago, 90% of the hands

307
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,500
would have gone up.

308
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,100
OK?

309
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,750
So what that means is the
price mechanism has

310
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,000
started to be used.

311
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,240
It has replaced the line
mechanism as a way to allocate

312
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,700
those tickets.

313
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,070
And we see prices working.

314
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:47,760
That wasn't true.

315
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,120
There wasn't StubHub.

316
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,470
There weren't these secondary
ticket sellers 30 years ago.

317
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,640
You had to wait on line
to get the tickets.

318
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,590
Now, so that's basically, sort
of, an overview about, sort of

319
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,300
an example, of how we think
about the role of prices.

320
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,420
Now, let me draw a couple of
important distinctions, terms

321
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,970
I'm going to use this semester
that I want you to be

322
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,270
comfortable with.

323
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,000
OK?

324
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,580
The first distinction I want to
draw is between theoretical

325
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,345
versus empirical economics.

326
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:23,720

327
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,680
Theoretical versus empirical
economics.

328
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,460
OK.

329
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:34,940
Theoretical economics is the
process of building models to

330
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,190
explain the world.

331
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,070

332
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:40,860
OK?

333
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,260
Empirical economics is the
process of testing those

334
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:49,480
models to see how good
a job they do in

335
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,380
explaining the world.

336
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,200
OK?

337
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,630
We could all make up a model.

338
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:54,950
OK?

339
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,890
Anybody with math skills
could make up a model.

340
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,040
But it doesn't do any good
unless it's actually doing

341
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,600
something to explain
the world.

342
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,490
And so basically, the goal of
theoretical economics is

343
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:12,560
essentially to build a model
that has some testable

344
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,090
predictions.

345
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,490
To build a model that says,
look here's my simplified

346
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:22,050
model of how consumers decide
whether or not to buy an iPod.

347
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:22,570
OK?

348
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,830
I have a model of that, that
I've built theoretically.

349
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,410
Well, that has some testable
predictions.

350
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,320
And the role of empirical
economics is to gather the

351
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,490
data and go and test them using
statistical methods.

352
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,700
Specifically, typically
regression analysis like the

353
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,820
kind you learn about in
advanced statistics.

354
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,980
OK?

355
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,775
So basically, what we're going
to do is we're going to is 95%

356
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:46,440
of this course will be
about theoretical

357
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,940
economics this semester.

358
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,210
It will be about understanding
how economists develop the

359
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:53,680
models to model how consumers
and firms behave. But I will

360
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,610
try to talk somewhat about
empirical economics and what

361
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,730
data we can bring to bear to
understand whether or not

362
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,080
these models explain
the world.

363
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,230
OK?

364
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:10,540
The other distinction that's
very important is positive

365
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:17,570
versus normative economics.

366
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,020
Positive versus normative
economics.

367
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,950
And this is the distinction
between the way things are,

368
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:30,370
which is positive economics, and
the way things should be

369
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,920
which is normative economics.

370
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,600
Distinction between the way
things are and the way

371
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,160
things should be.

372
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,060
OK?

373
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,660
So let's consider a great
example of microeconomics at

374
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,880
work which is auctions
on eBay.

375
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,210
OK?

376
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:48,000
Auctions on eBay, economists
love studying auctions on eBay

377
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,390
because it's a textbook example
of what we call a

378
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:55,100
perfectly competitive market
which is what we'll focus on

379
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,670
the semester.

380
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,060
A perfectly competitive
market.

381
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,930
OK?

382
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:07,040
And by that we mean that
basically that producers in

383
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,620
this market offer up
their good to a

384
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,390
wide range of consumers.

385
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,500
OK?

386
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,610
A number of producers offer
up their goods to a

387
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,840
wide range of consumers.

388
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,530
OK?

389
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:22,150
And the consumers bid up the
price until the person who has

390
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,680
the highest value for
the good gets it.

391
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,350
So price serves exactly
the signal it should

392
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,240
in allocating goods.

393
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,670
OK?

394
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,150
So really eBay's really sort of
about this third thing of

395
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,660
who gets the good.

396
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,360
OK?

397
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:41,840
I offer my alarm clock or
whatever on eBay, OK, and then

398
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,760
people bid on that.

399
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,880
And whoever values that the
most, that rare Jon Gruber

400
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,460
alarm clock the most,
they get it.

401
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,150
OK?

402
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,780
So it's a perfect textbook
example.

403
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,590
OK?

404
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,980
And basically, because on eBay
the price is used, or now with

405
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,670
also StubHub and concert
tickets, the price is used to

406
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,740
allocate the good to the
person who wants

407
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,620
it the most. OK?

408
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,380
Now, a recent example of an
auction on eBay that a lot of

409
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,940
attention, not so recent anymore
a couple years ago,

410
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,020
someone tried to auction
their kidney on eBay.

411
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,510
OK?

412
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,010
Someone offered their kidney for
auction on eBay and said,

413
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,349
I have two kidneys
I only need one.

414
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:20,200
So I'm going to auction my
kidney, you pay for me to fly

415
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,300
to wherever you need my kidney
and the operation, they take

416
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,680
it out and they give
it to you.

417
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,060
And that's the way it goes.

418
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,500
So what happened was person
offered their kidney and they

419
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,390
said the starting price
will be $25,000.

420
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,620
They didn't do a buy it now.

421
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,150
They said the starting price
will be $25,000 and the

422
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,860
bidding went on.

423
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,720
The price got to $5 million
before eBay shot it down.

424
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,120
eBay shut the auction down.

425
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,390
And eBay said no, in fact,
you can't do this.

426
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,380
Now there's two questions
here.

427
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,470
The first is, why did
the price of the

428
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,690
kidney go so high?

429
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,950
That's the positive question.

430
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,440
The positive question is, why
did the price the kidney on

431
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,940
eBay get so high?

432
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,720
And here, we'll talk, and you'll
learn more starting

433
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:12,360
Friday, about the twin forces
of supply and demand.

434
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,640
The twin forces that drive the
economy of supply and demand.

435
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,920
And you'll talk more rigorously

436
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,320
about these on Friday.

437
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,290
Basically, they're what
they sound like.

438
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,670
Demand is how much someone
wants something.

439
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,900
Supply is how much of
it there is to have.

440
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,300
And the intuition here
is surprising.

441
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:32,990
OK?

442
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:40,730
The more that there's demand for
a good, the higher will be

443
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,500
the upward pressure on prices.

444
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,530
The more people want a good,
the higher prices will go.

445
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,430
And the less supply there is
of a good, also the higher

446
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,400
prices will go.

447
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,310
So if everybody wants something
but it's common, the

448
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,650
price will be low.

449
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,220
And if no one wants something
but it's uncommon, the price

450
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,240
will still be low,
and vice versa.

451
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,000
In fact, the development of the
model of supply and demand

452
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,900
framework was from Adam Smith,
the, sort of, so-called first

453
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,360
economist who wrote The Wealth
of Nations in 1776 which is,

454
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,610
sort of, viewed as the,
kind of, first

455
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,440
serious book about economics.

456
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,400
And he posed what he called
the water diamond paradox.

457
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,500
What Smith said in that book is,
look, it's clear water is

458
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,700
the most important
thing in life.

459
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,060
We can't live without water.

460
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,670
And diamonds are completely
irrelevant to life.

461
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,810
You can live totally fine
without a diamond.

462
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,190
And yet, the price
of diamonds is

463
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,860
astronomical and water's free.

464
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,340
How can this be?

465
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,620
How can it be that water which
is so much more of a

466
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,230
fundamental building block of
our life is so much cheaper

467
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,220
than diamonds which are not.

468
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,110
And the answer, of course, is
that so far you've only

469
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,260
considered demand
and not supply.

470
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:43,910
Yes, it's true.

471
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,300
The demand for water
is much higher than

472
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,200
the demand for diamonds.

473
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,170
But the supply is even larger.

474
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,690
So that basically, yes it's true
that while water should

475
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,530
be worth more, in fact, in the
end the price of water is much

476
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,570
lower, because of the twin
forces of demand and supply.

477
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,150
The demand is higher, but the
supply is much higher.

478
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,490
So the price ends up lower.

479
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,320
And that was his diamond
water paradox.

480
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:06,760
OK?

481
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,890
Well, in this case, it's
a similar thing.

482
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,530
What determines the demand
for a kidney?

483
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,905
What determines the demand for
a kidney is going to be the

484
00:20:14,905 --> 00:20:16,770
fact that you die without it.

485
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,340
OK?

486
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,830
If you have no kidneys, you're
having kidney failure.

487
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,110
OK?

488
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,810
You'll die without it.

489
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,110
So basically, what will
determine it is people are

490
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,236
willing to spend all their
wealth, as much money as they

491
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:26,360
can have, to get a kidney OK?

492
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,320
So the demand will
be quite high.

493
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,220
The supply will be quite low.

494
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,940
Sadly, not many people are
willing to be organ donors.

495
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,490
More relevantly, a lot of
people aren't in good

496
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,480
situations to be organ donors.

497
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,110
OK?

498
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:41,980
As a result, the supply is much
lower than the demand.

499
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,775
So we have a situation with a
high demand, a low supply and

500
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:47,130
the price went through
the roof.

501
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,240
That's a positive analysis.

502
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,310
OK?

503
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,250
So we can understand
pretty intuitively.

504
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,750
We don't need this course
to understand why

505
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,120
the price went up.

506
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,410
OK?

507
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,460
It's just the twin powers
of demand and supply.

508
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,790
But what about the normative
question which is, should eBay

509
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,220
have allowed this
sale to happen?

510
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,980
EBay at $5 million cut it off
and then passed the rule

511
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,420
saying you can't auction your
body parts on eBay.

512
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:12,870
OK?

513
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,180
Should they have done that?

514
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,160
That's the normative question.

515
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,200
That's economics gets really
interesting, which is you all

516
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,660
are smart enough to figure out
why the price went up.

517
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:27,070
But this is where it gets
interesting is should people

518
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:31,510
have been able to auction
their kidney on eBay?

519
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:35,200
On the one hand, many, many
people in this country die for

520
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,030
want of a body part.

521
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,920
OK?

522
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,090
Thousands to hundreds of
thousands of people die every

523
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,300
year waiting for a transplant.

524
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:42,890
OK?

525
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:47,470
If someone is incredibly rich
and they want a body part,

526
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:51,800
which to me a surplus because
I have two kidneys, why

527
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,180
shouldn't they be allowed
to buy it from me?

528
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:59,560
I'm better off because they
can pay me a ton of money.

529
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,440
They are better off
because they live.

530
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,490
So I've just described a
transaction that makes both

531
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,660
parties better off.

532
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,540
Why shouldn't that be
allowed to happen?

533
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,790
So you tell me.

534
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,900

535
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,670
Does everyone think
eBay was wrong?

536
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,399
Yeah, go ahead.

537
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:15,158
AUDIENCE: Say there is another
person who doesn't have as

538
00:22:15,158 --> 00:22:16,408
much money, and that
person also dies.

539
00:22:16,408 --> 00:22:25,065

540
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:27,273
PROFESSOR: You mean the person
who, what do you mean the

541
00:22:27,273 --> 00:22:27,910
person doesn't have as much-

542
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,165
AUDIENCE: --so obviously
somebody

543
00:22:29,165 --> 00:22:32,257
doesn't get the kidney.

544
00:22:32,257 --> 00:22:35,205

545
00:22:35,205 --> 00:22:37,460
PROFESSOR: So in other words,
what you're assuming is, let's

546
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,550
say that if I hadn't done the
auction on eBay, I would have

547
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,300
just given my kidney away to
the transplant center.

548
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,780
Then that's one less kidney
that can go to

549
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,940
the transplant center.

550
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,180
And that means the rich guy gets
the kidney, and someone

551
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,610
else implicitly doesn't.

552
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,890
That's a trade-off.

553
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,570
You've just described
a trade-off.

554
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:55,180
The trade-off is that basically
now we've allocated

555
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,470
the kidney away from the poor
person to the rich person.

556
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,600
Now, but why do we
care about that?

557
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,550
I mean one person dies,
another person

558
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,550
lives, why do we care?

559
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:04,945
Yeah?

560
00:23:04,945 --> 00:23:07,085
AUDIENCE: There would
be some sort of case

561
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,664
of severity in condition.

562
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:11,395
Like there might be someone
who's poor who would get the

563
00:23:11,395 --> 00:23:14,930
kidney if it went to a
transplant association because

564
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:18,790
they would die in a couple
of days without it.

565
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,470
Whereas the rich person might
just be able to afford it, and

566
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,826
it might make their life
more convenient.

567
00:23:22,826 --> 00:23:24,940
But they might not be
in any more peril.

568
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,760

569
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,480
PROFESSOR: They might
be a collector.

570
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,980
So basically, that's right.

571
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:35,770
So one reason we might care is
because we think that kidneys

572
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,170
should be allocated on the
basis of who needs

573
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,700
it the most. OK?

574
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,490
So a great example of this, of
course, was Mickey Mantle with

575
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,570
a liver transplant.

576
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:46,410
Mickey Mantle, famous
ballplayer, raging alcoholic,

577
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,950
who had liver failure because
he was basically drinking

578
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:52,570
himself to death, and jumped
the queue and got a liver

579
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,530
above a bunch, a lot of people
and then he kept drinking and

580
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,610
killed himself and wasted
the liver he'd gotten.

581
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,050
OK?

582
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:00,270
So basically, you can think
that doesn't make sense.

583
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,850
We should give it to people who
need it the most. For who

584
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,660
it would do the most
good in terms of

585
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,800
increasing their life.

586
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,050
OK.

587
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,410

588
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,610
So we've got the substitution
point.

589
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:12,080
OK.

590
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,420
Let's come back to the
substitution point though.

591
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,300
Tell me a situation in
which that's wrong.

592
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,270
Can someone tell me a situation
in which, in fact,

593
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,020
that not a valid point.

594
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,360
Yeah.

595
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,779
AUDIENCE: Well, if the guy
is only going to sell it.

596
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:22,725
He's not going to
give it away.

597
00:24:22,725 --> 00:24:24,617
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

598
00:24:24,617 --> 00:24:26,509
You're assuming that the
guy who did sell

599
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:27,460
would give it away.

600
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,720
But, in fact, if it's
sell it or keep it

601
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,670
then there's no trade-off.

602
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:39,430
And similar here, if it's sell
it or keep it then you might

603
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,130
as well let the rich
guy get it.

604
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,440
Or is there another argument?

605
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,720
Is there another reason
why you might not

606
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,883
want this to happen?

607
00:24:46,883 --> 00:24:47,374
Yeah.

608
00:24:47,374 --> 00:24:49,171
AUDIENCE: It would encourage
people to use illegal ways of

609
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:50,421
getting kidneys.

610
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:54,610

611
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:58,390
PROFESSOR: So the other reason
could be that we don't trust

612
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,950
people to make good decisions
when money's involved.

613
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,610
That we think that, gee, if it's
really true I can get a

614
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:07,450
couple million bucks for a
kidney, I might give mine up

615
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,920
even if I haven't really
thought through the

616
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,730
ramifications of doing so.

617
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,970
Even if there's a risk to the
surgery, if there's a risk

618
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,300
that my other kidney will then
fail then I'll be screwed.

619
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:16,800
OK?

620
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:23,840
So basically, we might have a
paternalistic attitude that

621
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,320
will lead us to not want to
allow people to engage in this

622
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,440
kind of risky behavior.

623
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:28,873
Yeah?

624
00:25:28,873 --> 00:25:30,870
AUDIENCE: There may also be
some legal ramifications

625
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,574
associated with that if someone
sells their kidney and

626
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:37,096
then their other kidney fails,
they might then blame eBay.

627
00:25:37,096 --> 00:25:37,554
PROFESSOR: Want it back.

628
00:25:37,554 --> 00:25:39,850
Like that Repo movie.

629
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,200
That's right.

630
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,630
There could, but let's leave the
lawyers out of this, OK?

631
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,440
I don't like lawyers.

632
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,260
I'm going to rag on lawyers
this semester.

633
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,530
We're going leave the
lawyers out of this.

634
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,010
But, in any case,
you're right.

635
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:52,550
That's, sort of, a

636
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,180
ramification of the same thing.

637
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,330
So we've talked about the fact
that there's substitution.

638
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,340
We've talked about the fact
that it's not allocated to

639
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,580
those who need it the most.
We've talked about the fact

640
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,370
that people might be making bad
decisions in doing this.

641
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:08,180
But there's another factor, as
well, which is we may just as

642
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,240
a society feel it's unfair
that rich people can get

643
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,560
things poor people can't.

644
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,660
There may be a pure equity
component here.

645
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,180
OK?

646
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,100
Which is simply that we as a
society value equality, value

647
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,500
income inequality.

648
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,250
And we think people should not
have an extra shot at getting

649
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,970
a resource just because
they're rich.

650
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:31,380
Now that is a very deep and hard
concept, and we'll spend

651
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,970
a couple lectures talking about
equity towards the end

652
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:34,810
of the semester.

653
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,720
By and large, we won't
consider it.

654
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,270
OK?

655
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:42,300
But it turns out to be behind
much of what we'll discuss,

656
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,660
OK, in much of what we'll
discuss this semester and much

657
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,340
of what goes on in economics.

658
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,070
OK?

659
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,660
Just take a look at the debate
that's going on right now in

660
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,720
terms of President Obama trying
to decide whether or

661
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,610
not to extend tax cuts to
wealthy individuals in the US.

662
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:06,400
Some people argue that allowing
those tax cuts would

663
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,800
promote the economy.

664
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,400
OK?

665
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,730
But others argue it's
unfair for rich

666
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,630
people to get tax breaks.

667
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,450
And that fairness argument
matters a lot in terms of

668
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,010
driving the kind of
economic policy

669
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:22,010
decisions we need to make.

670
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:25,530
So this semester, we're going
to focus a lot on efficiency

671
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:28,950
and optimization and how
to get resources

672
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,150
to the right place.

673
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,220
But you have to remember behind
a lot of this is deep

674
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,200
normative issues about what
should be happening, how

675
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,440
should an economy function, and,
in particular, how should

676
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,540
we think about these
kind of equity

677
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,920
issues that are so important.

678
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,440
OK.

679
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,920
The last thing I want to talk
about is I want to talk about

680
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,490
why micro is not just an
abstract concept for things

681
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:55,300
like you might say, oh this is
all pretty funny and it's like

682
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,860
selling kidneys on eBay and
tax cuts for the rich

683
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,070
and why do I care?

684
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,640
OK?

685
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,470
Well, you care because literally
every decision you

686
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,790
make is made through the kind
of framework we're going to

687
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,960
think about this semester.

688
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,490
OK?

689
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:13,060
Now, different decisions may
follow our models more closely

690
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,840
and less closely.

691
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,740
But there is not an
economic decision.

692
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,910
OK?

693
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:19,970
Sorry, let me back up.

694
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,990
There's not a decision that
people have made that

695
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,090
economists haven't
tried to model.

696
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:26,850
From whether to produce iPods,
to how many times to

697
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,170
have sex each week.

698
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:28,640
OK?

699
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,630
These are all things economists
have tried to model

700
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,790
with varying degrees
of success.

701
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,980
OK?

702
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,420
Because economists think that
these all come from the same

703
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,080
decision theoretic framework
that we can discuss.

704
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,430
Let's talk about a simple
example from this course.

705
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,880
Your decision of whether or
not to buy the textbook.

706
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,780
There's a textbook and
what's it cost? $140?

707
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,540
What's it cost?

708
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,500
Does anyone know?

709
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,950
AUDIENCE: This line says $180.

710
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,400
And this one says $180, but
it's available for $130.

711
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,450
PROFESSOR: $130, fine.

712
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,340
So $130 for Professor Perloff
out at Berkeley.

713
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,050
He doesn't get it all.

714
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:04,630
I wrote a textbook too.

715
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,000
He gets a small share of it.

716
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,740
OK.

717
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,250
So you have to decide, now has
anyone bought a used version

718
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,067
of the fourth, well it's the
fifth edition now, does

719
00:29:14,067 --> 00:29:16,040
anybody use a version of
the fourth edition?

720
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,440
Does anyone know what
the used price is?

721
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,660
You can be honest.
I don't care.

722
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,970
AUDIENCE: I know some people
found it for like $85 or so.

723
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,440
PROFESSOR: So $85.

724
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,200
So you've got to decide.

725
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,380
So let's say you can buy the
previous edition, the fourth

726
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:34,390
edition, for $85 or the current
edition for $130.

727
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,090
OK?

728
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:37,160
You've got to make
that decision.

729
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,650
OK?

730
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,550
How do you make that decision.

731
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,440
Well you may think, gee I
just make the decision.

732
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,860
It's not really about
microeconomics.

733
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,920
But it is.

734
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,540
We're going to model how
you think about a

735
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,500
decision like that.

736
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,670
Well how do you think about
a decision like that?

737
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:52,900
Well, the first thing you
consider is your preferences.

738
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,280
How much are you willing to take
a chance that there's new

739
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,454
stuff in the fifth edition
that you need to know?

740
00:29:59,454 --> 00:30:00,740
OK?

741
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,250
If the fifth issue was identical
to the fourth

742
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,340
edition then you'd be an idiot
to not just buy the used

743
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:04,970
fourth edition.

744
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,030
But it's not.

745
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,180
Textbook writers are smart.

746
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,460
They update their book.

747
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,210
OK?

748
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:11,670
So basically, the fifth
edition is updated.

749
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,950
There's new things in it.

750
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:16,880
So you have to ask yourself,
what are the odds that I need

751
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,670
some of the new information in
the fifth edition and not in

752
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:19,910
the fourth edition?

753
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,400
And in thinking about that,
you're going to think about

754
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,070
your preferences.

755
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:26,090
In particular, are you very risk
averse, are you afraid to

756
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,410
take a chance?

757
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,590
Or are you risk loving?

758
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,410
Are you willing to
take a chance?

759
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,050
OK?

760
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,370
That's one side of
the equation.

761
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,810
If you're someone that says,
you know I will not take a

762
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:35,450
chance in life.

763
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,420
I just have to make sure I learn
the most possible from

764
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,820
this course.

765
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,040
Then you're going to want
that new edition.

766
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,410
If you're someone that says, you
know what screw it, I'll

767
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,610
just figure it out later.

768
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:44,350
I'm going to the lectures.

769
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,490
I don't care.

770
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,100
OK?

771
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,830
Then you might not want
it that much.

772
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,950
So that's the first factor, is
going to be your preferences

773
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,230
and break down how much you
are willing to take a risk

774
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,230
that you need this
fifth edition.

775
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,820
The second factor is going to
be your constraint: how much

776
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,590
money you have. OK.

777
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,430
The more money you have, the
more you're willing, or more

778
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:03,210
relevant perhaps your parents
have, the more willing you are

779
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,980
to go ahead and buy
that new edition.

780
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,060
The less money you have, the
less willing you are.

781
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,950
OK?

782
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,390
So basically, it's going to
depend on whether you're

783
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,070
paying or your parents are
paying, in which case what the

784
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,680
hell you might as well buy
the fifth edition.

785
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,640
OK?

786
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:20,570
And then finally, you're going
to take these preferences and

787
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:23,370
this constraint, your
preferences and your

788
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,510
resources, and go to the market
and look at what does

789
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,485
the market tell me the
difference is.

790
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:30,230
So you're going to say, here's
how much I kind of care about

791
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:34,180
fifth versus fourth edition,
here's the resources I have,

792
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:39,570
now I'll go to the market and
say, aha there is a $45

793
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,530
difference between these
two editions.

794
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,550
So now I will solve
that constrained

795
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,470
optimization problem.

796
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:52,430
And I'll decide whether I
want to get that book.

797
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,730
You are going to be thinking to
yourself, this is stupid.

798
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,530
I never think about
it that way.

799
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,440
But the key point is you don't
have to think about it

800
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,740
exactly that way.

801
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,400
There's a famous example in
economics of what's called the

802
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,440
as if principle.

803
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,380
I don't know if kids still
say this one, as if.

804
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,130
So it's the as if principle.

805
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:06,720
OK?

806
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,545
And basically it's from Milton
Friedman, the famous economist

807
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:13,150
from Chicago, who said, look,
when you're playing pool,

808
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:17,110
technically you could compute
the optimal angles of which to

809
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,310
shoot the ball every single time
to get the appropriate

810
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,210
bounce and get the balls in.

811
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,610
You could do the mathematics
and compute it.

812
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:25,870
But professional pool players
are not in this class with

813
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:26,710
you, I'll only say that.

814
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,260
OK?

815
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,710
They're not guys who are able
to do that computation.

816
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,830
They just know how to hit the
ball to get the same outcome

817
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,980
they would get if they
mathematically solved for the

818
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,900
optimal trajectory
to hit the ball.

819
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,190
OK?

820
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:42,160
They behave as if they've
solved the constrained

821
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,330
optimization problem.

822
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,650
And your decision when you buy
this book, you may not think

823
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:49,432
it through the very framework
that I just laid out very

824
00:32:49,432 --> 00:32:52,380
heuristically and will lay out
more rigorously this semester.

825
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,940
But you're going to behave
as if you do.

826
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,460
Because those facts are going to
be in your mind, and you'll

827
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,700
be thinking about it when
you make that decision.

828
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,050
So while you may feel the models
we learn in this course

829
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:04,430
are rather abstract and don't
really explain how you behave

830
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:07,200
in an everyday basis, you're
going to behave as if those

831
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,290
models are really
applying to you.

832
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,340
And if you think about, over the
next few days, think about

833
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,530
the decisions you make.

834
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,820
From should I bring
an umbrella today,

835
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,000
it looks like rain?

836
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,080
Well, on the one hand,
I might lose it.

837
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,860
It's a pain to carry.

838
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,770
On the other hand, how much do
I care about getting wet?

839
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:23,300
That's a constrained
optimization decision.

840
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,010
To should I have an extra drink
at a party Friday night?

841
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,290
On the one hand, that could
have some pros and cons.

842
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:30,850
OK?

843
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:34,050
These are all decisions,
constrained optimization

844
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,680
decisions, you're
going to make.

845
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,440
They're going to affect
your life.

846
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,180
And what we'll learn this
semester is about how you make

847
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,390
them and how we model, how
economists can use what we

848
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:43,520
learn about that to understand
the function of the economy.

849
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,220
OK?

850
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,280
So I'm going to stop there.

851
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,130
One other announcement, there
will, in general, be handouts

852
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:50,660
every lecture.

853
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,210
I'm not going to
do PowerPoint.

854
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:51,900
I'm going to do handouts.

855
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,000
So when you come in every
lecture, please look at the

856
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,880
back banister.

857
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,200
Though typically, not today.

858
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,160
But typically, they'll be
handouts that you'll need to

859
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,900
follow along with in class.

860
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:05,130
So remember, go to section on
Friday, first problems that

861
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,480
will be posted on Friday and it
will be due in section the

862
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
Friday after.

863
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,220
And I'll see you all back here
on Monday, next Monday.

864
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,929
