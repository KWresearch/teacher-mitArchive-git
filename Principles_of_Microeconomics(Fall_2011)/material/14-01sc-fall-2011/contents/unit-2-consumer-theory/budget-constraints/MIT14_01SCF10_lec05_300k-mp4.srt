10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,730
PROFESSOR: All right, so today
we're going to continue our

11
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,250
discussion of consumer choice.

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,759
If you remember the set-up
from last time, the main

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,450
motivation is you're trying to
understand what underlies

14
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,790
demand curves, how consumers
ultimately decide to trade off

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,860
price and quantity of goods.

16
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,315
We said that ultimately that
came from the principle of

17
00:00:44,315 --> 00:00:49,530
utility maximization, and that
utility is maximized when

18
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,770
individuals maximize the utility
function, which is

19
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,580
this mathematical representation
of preferences.

20
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,730
And last time we talked about
how if individuals were

21
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,240
unconstrained how they choose
what they want, they would

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,940
just like more of everything,
and their ranking across

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,590
different bundles would
depend on that

24
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,520
underlying utility function.

25
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,390
Now, of course, what's stopping
individuals from

26
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,300
consuming everything they want
is their budget constraints.

27
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,690
And so today we're going to turn
to the second part of the

28
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,930
problem, which is talking about
budget constraints.

29
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,060
Now, we're going to make a very
simplifying assumption

30
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,000
here for most of the semester,
which is we are going to

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,920
assume that your income
equals your budget.

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,010
That is, you spend your
entire income.

33
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,600
That is, we're going to ignore
the possibility of savings

34
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,370
until about the third lecture
from the end.

35
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,430
Now, this turns out not to be a
terrible assumption for the

36
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,230
typical American.

37
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,600
The typical American doesn't
save. So actually, it's not a

38
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,050
terrible assumption for us to
work with if we think about

39
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,680
typical consumers.

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,610
In practice, savings is going
to turn out to be a very

41
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,650
critical part of what we're
going to do to think about

42
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,405
economics, so we'll
come back to that.

43
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,470
But we're going to ignore
savings for now and assume

44
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,680
that your budget equals
your income.

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,910
So let's say that your parents,
probably a good model

46
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,020
is you guys, you guys probably
aren't in saving mode.

47
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,780
You've got some budget saved
from your parents.

48
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,000
Let's call it y.

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,979
And let's say that your parents
give you some budget

50
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,430
at the start of the semester,
y, and they say this is your

51
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,520
money you have to spend,
say each month or

52
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,770
for the whole semester.

53
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,670

54
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,070
And let's imagine that you have
to allocate that budget

55
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,840
only across two goods,
pizza and movies.

56
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,650
So once again, unrealistic,
but this is the kind of

57
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,850
simplifying assumption that lets
us understand how people

58
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,260
make decisions.

59
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,000
So that gives you your
budget constraint.

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,590
You've got some income y that
your parents have given you,

61
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,750
and you can allocate that
across pizza and movies.

62
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,100
So how do you allocate that?

63
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,770
Well, you can buy movies, the
number of movies you can get,

64
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,130
plus the number of pizzas.

65
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,790
Well, how many of each
you can get, that

66
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,100
depends on their price.

67
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,130
In particular, budget constraint
is the number of

68
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,920
movies times the price
per movie plus the

69
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,220
number of pizzas --

70
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,310
plus the number of pizzas times
the price for pizza.

71
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,960
That's your budget constraint.

72
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,880
It's the number of movies times
the price per movie or

73
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,630
the number of pizzas times
the price for pizza.

74
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,900
And this is easiest to
see graphically.

75
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,850
If you go to figure 5-1, this is
a graphical illustration of

76
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,630
a budget constraint.

77
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,450
Now, let's just carefully talk
through this for a moment.

78
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,190
You're going to be really good
at dealing with budget

79
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:28,730
constraints.

80
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,930
You're going to have to
be this semester.

81
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,410
So let's carefully talk about
where this comes from.

82
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:38,050
OK, the x-axis is going to be
how many movies you could have

83
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,850
if all you did with your income
was consume movies.

84
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,020
Well, if all you did with your
income was consume movies, you

85
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,385
could have y over
p sub m movies.

86
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:49,340

87
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,640
If you decided to devote your
income solely to movies, then

88
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:59,340
you could have y times y
over p sub m movies.

89
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,080
If instead you decided to devote
all your income to

90
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,360
pizza, then you could have
y over p sub p pizza.

91
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,990
So the y-axis is going to be
the point where you consume

92
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,730
zero movies and all pizza.

93
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,070
It's going to be where
you devote your

94
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,940
entire budget to pizzas.

95
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,890
And then there'll be some
combination in between, which

96
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,220
is our budget line.

97
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,620
Which is the combinations of
pizzas and movies you can

98
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,277
consume given your
total income y.

99
00:04:26,277 --> 00:04:29,270

100
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,040
And the slope of that line is
going to be the price ratio.

101
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,620
Or the negative of
the price ratio.

102
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:59,500
The slope of that line is going
to be minus pp over pm.

103
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,180
The slope of that line is going
to be the change in the

104
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:09,540
ratio of the price of pizza
to the price of movies.

105
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,030
OK, what am I doing
wrong here?

106
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,920

107
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,260
Negative of the price ratio.

108
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,400
Have I got this right?

109
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,493
Rise over run.

110
00:05:17,493 --> 00:05:18,743
Yeah.

111
00:05:18,743 --> 00:05:24,845

112
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:27,914
Have I got this right?

113
00:05:27,914 --> 00:05:28,405
Yeah.

114
00:05:28,405 --> 00:05:31,351
AUDIENCE: I think that the pp
and the pm's are in the

115
00:05:31,351 --> 00:05:33,806
denominators, because it's y
over pp [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

116
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:38,225

117
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:38,716
PROFESSOR: Right.

118
00:05:38,716 --> 00:05:40,189
It's the denominators, that's
what I did wrong.

119
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:41,439
Right, so it is pm over pp.

120
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,150

121
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,050
Sorry, my bad.

122
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,130
OK, right.

123
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:46,830
Because they're the
denominators.

124
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,300
Because it's the rise over run
in terms of the quantity.

125
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,290
So that's what I did wrong.

126
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,980
OK, so basically it's the
negative of the price ratio,

127
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,150
minus the price of movies over
the price of pizzas because

128
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,170
they're in the denominators as
you said, because as the price

129
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,790
goes up, the quantity
goes down.

130
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,320
So the negative of the price
ratio of the price of movies

131
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,850
to the price of pizzas
is the slope.

132
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,820
So let's just do a
simple example.

133
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,490
Imagine that income
equals $96.

134
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,080
Imagine your parents
give you $96, say

135
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,340
a month or a semester.

136
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:21,420
Imagine that the price of movies
is $8 and imagine the

137
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,480
price of a pizza is $16.

138
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,420
It's a good pizza.

139
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:32,240
So what this means is that with
your income of $96, you

140
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,220
could either get eight
pizzas or 12 movies.

141
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,180
So that means that the price
ratio of the slope of your

142
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,020
budget constraint
is minus 1/2.

143
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,540
The price ratio is minus 1/2.

144
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,550
So the slope of that budget
constraint is minus 1/2.

145
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,910
Now, we have a name
for this slope.

146
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,740
We're going to call this
the marginal rate of

147
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,580
transformation.

148
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,030
The marginal rate of
transformation is our label

149
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,220
for this slope.

150
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,460
Now, why do we use that name?

151
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,830
Well, it means that's the
marginal rate at which you can

152
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:17,170
transform pizzas into movies.

153
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,320
The rate at which you can
turn pizzas into movies.

154
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,950
Now, once again, like I talked
about last time, you're not an

155
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,690
alchemist. You're not actually
turning pizzas into movies.

156
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,890
But the market essentially is
giving you a rate at which you

157
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,770
can do that given a budget,
given that you have a certain

158
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,410
amount of money.

159
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:41,200
Given that you have a certain
amount of money, $96, and

160
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,340
given the prices that you face
in the market, you could

161
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,170
transform pizzas into movies
by trading one

162
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,770
pizza for 1/2 a movie.

163
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,850
Now, once again, you're not
actually doing the physical

164
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,700
transformation, but that's the
trade-off that you face when

165
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,300
you're trying to transform
one to the other.

166
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,760
So effectively, it's the same as
if you're trading them for

167
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,650
each other.

168
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,090
As I talked about last time.

169
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,160
it's essentially the same as
you're trading, and that's

170
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,350
because of the key economic
concept we'll come back to

171
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,540
over and over again
in this course--

172
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:20,360
the concept of opportunity
cost.

173
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,660
The opportunity cost is the
value of the forgone

174
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,910
alternative.

175
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:39,740

176
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,250
The value of the forgone
alternative is the opportunity

177
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:48,120
cost. So basically what that
means is if you decide to

178
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:59,970
forgo a pizza, that's the same
as forgoing two movies.

179
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,150
Likewise, if you decide to forgo
a movie, it's the same

180
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,660
as forgoing half a pizza.

181
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,270
So the opportunity cost of a
movie, what essentially the

182
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,780
movie is costing you,
is 1/2 a pizza.

183
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,100
Now, really it's costing you $8
and a pizza costs you $16.

184
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,850
But when we think about
trading off goods, the

185
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,770
opportunity cost of that movie
is that you've forgone the

186
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,300
ability to eat half a pizza.

187
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,510
That's the opportunity cost
of the situation.

188
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,630
So that's basically
how we're going to

189
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,000
think about this trade-off.

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,430
We're going to think about
trading off goods as the

191
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,900
opportunity cost of consuming
one good instead of another.

192
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,730
The opportunity cost of that
movie is that you haven't

193
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,730
gotten to eat 1/2 a pizza.

194
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,130
The opportunity cost of the
pizza is that you've forgone

195
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,860
seeing two movies.

196
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,640
And the reason is because
you have a fixed budget.

197
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,750
If you had an infinite budget,
there'd be no opportunity

198
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,410
cost. But because you have a
fixed budget and you have to

199
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:57,570
allocate that budget, there's
an opportunity cost. If you

200
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,340
choose not to decide, you've
still made a choice.

201
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,940
I don't know whether that
quote's due to Shakespeare or

202
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,850
Rush, I'm not sure.

203
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,060
I have to look that up.

204
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,880
But basically, if you choose
to have one thing, then by

205
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,890
definition you're forgoing
another.

206
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,470
Now, to understand the budget
constraint, let's talk about

207
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,240
what happens when we shock
the budget constraint.

208
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,210

209
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:29,000
Let's imagine the price of
pizzas rose from $16 to $24.

210
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,270
Pizzas got really expensive.

211
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,780
We decided we only want gourmet
pizzas or something.

212
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,930
The price of pizzas went
from $16 to $24.

213
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:38,540
What does this do?

214
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,180
Well, let's look
at figure 5-2.

215
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,120
It'll show what that does.

216
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,930
What that does is it says our
new budget constraint, instead

217
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:51,320
of being 16p plus 8m equals 96,
which is what the budget

218
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,680
constraint was in our example,
it's now 24p

219
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,370
plus 8m equals 96.

220
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,020
That's the new equation for
the budget constraint.

221
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,940
Or, more relevantly, the slope
of the budget constraint has

222
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,370
flattened from minus
1/2 to minus 1/3.

223
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:11,240
The slope has fallen from
minus 1/2 to minus 1/3.

224
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:18,390
The price ratio has been reduced
from 1/2 to 1/3.

225
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,530
Now, forget utility
for a second.

226
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,790
Forget the fact that we
thought about utility.

227
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:29,390
Just looking at this, can you
tell whether you are better or

228
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:33,010
worse off from this
price change?

229
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,950
You shook your head
no, why not?

230
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,151
AUDIENCE: Because you don't know
if you like pizzas enough

231
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:38,360
to get any.

232
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,420
PROFESSOR: OK, well
in particular,

233
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,180
you can almost tell.

234
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,010
Who's the only person
who doesn't care

235
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,589
about this price change?

236
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:49,068
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

237
00:11:49,068 --> 00:11:51,050
PROFESSOR: No, no no.

238
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,080
Think about consumers, people
with different preferences for

239
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,960
pizzas and movies.

240
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,850
What would your preference for
pizzas and movies have to be

241
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,610
for you not to care about
this price change?

242
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,830
All movies.

243
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,280
So long as you care about
pizza at all,

244
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,790
you're worse off.

245
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:09,880
So in fact, the answer is your
opportunity set has been

246
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,940
restricted.

247
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,960
So we can think about
the opportunity set.

248
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,290

249
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,430
Your opportunity set is the set
of choices you can make

250
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,550
given your budget.

251
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,470
Before, you could make choices
all the way up

252
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,070
to the upper line.

253
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,540
Now your set of choices
that are

254
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,640
available have just fallen.

255
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,720
Now, you're no poorer-- it's
not like your parents

256
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,890
have cut you off.

257
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,390
They still give you the $96.

258
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,990
But you're effectively poorer.

259
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,620
You're effectively worse
off, and why is that?

260
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,620
Because the set of things you
could afford with that $96 has

261
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,850
just been restricted.

262
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,310
And unless you truly have no
value on pizza, unless all you

263
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:49,840
care about's the movie--

264
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:56,600
you're gluten and cheese
allergic or something, you

265
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,850
have no value on pizza--

266
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,660

267
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,790
then you're worse off.

268
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,835
Your opportunity set's
restricted.

269
00:13:02,835 --> 00:13:06,000
And that's the key insight here,
is that you are worse

270
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,410
off because the price
has increased.

271
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,950
A price increase makes
you worse off.

272
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,950
It restricts your opportunity
set, because with the same

273
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:17,300
amount of income, you can
now afford fewer goods.

274
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,000
Your opportunity set has
been restricted.

275
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,020
Likewise, now let's talk
about what happens

276
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,840
when your income falls.

277
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,620
That's the next figure.

278
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,460
Now, let's suppose your parents
are pissed at you and

279
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,470
they cut you down to $80.

280
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,340
Because you didn't
do something.

281
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,970
You don't write enough or
call enough, so they

282
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,280
cut you down to $80.

283
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,490
Well, here the slope
of the budget

284
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,610
constraint has not changed.

285
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,430
Because what determines the
slope of the budget

286
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:42,870
constraint?

287
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,260
It's prices, and no prices
have changed.

288
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,000
The slope of the budget
constraint is unchanged

289
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,070
because prices haven't changed,
but your opportunity

290
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,400
set is once again restricted
because you

291
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,980
now have lower income.

292
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,740
So you can now afford fewer
pizzas and movies.

293
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,370
So now, instead of being able to
afford up to six pizzas and

294
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,010
up to 12 movies, you can now
only afford up to five pizzas

295
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,240
and up to 10 movies because
your income has fallen.

296
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,620
So once again, you're
unambiguously worse off.

297
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,560
Your opportunity set
has contracted.

298
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,600
So your opportunity set will
contract whenever income falls

299
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,230
or whenever price increases.

300
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,710
And how it affects the graph
will depend on whether it

301
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,170
affects prices, which affects
the slope, or just income,

302
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,650
which affects the intercepts.

303
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,830
Now, questions about the
budget constraints and

304
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,790
opportunity sets?

305
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,450
Armed with that--

306
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,214
Yeah, I'm sorry, go ahead.

307
00:14:36,214 --> 00:14:37,438
AUDIENCE: Is the area under
the curve at all

308
00:14:37,438 --> 00:14:38,688
indicative of utility?

309
00:14:38,688 --> 00:14:41,690

310
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,410
PROFESSOR:No, it's not, because
that's going to be

311
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,350
determined by your
preferences.

312
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,170
It's indicative of, if you
will, potential utility,

313
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,710
because that's your
opportunity set.

314
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:52,240
But as the example here points
out, if you don't like pizzas

315
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,890
at all, you'll feel very
differently than if you like

316
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:56,900
pizzas a lot.

317
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,610
So it's indicative of sort of
your potential utility, but

318
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,160
not your actual well-being.

319
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,920
But now that's a great segue
to the next step.

320
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,395
Let's put that together and talk
about constrained choice.

321
00:15:06,395 --> 00:15:11,650

322
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,820
Which is now, let's
put together--

323
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,200
we know what your preferences
are, we've mathematically

324
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,820
represented those by
utility function.

325
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,600
We know what your budget set
is, we've mathematically

326
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,410
represented that based on
your income and prices.

327
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,060
Now let's put them together
and talk about

328
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,580
how you make choices.

329
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:34,940
And the basic question you want
to ask is, what's the

330
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,050
highest utility you can achieve
given the constraints

331
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,880
your budget constraints
put on you?

332
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,820
Or, graphically--

333
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,110
so let's say you wanted to
understand this intuitively,

334
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,530
graphically, and
mathematically.

335
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:51,120
Intuitively the idea is quite
simple, I think, which is

336
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,775
just, what's the most you can
have given the constraints

337
00:15:55,775 --> 00:15:57,170
that are placed on you?

338
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,010
Graphically, we represent that
as asking, what is the

339
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,640
furthest out indifference
curve you can achieve?

340
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,080
Because remember,
more is better.

341
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,260
Indifference curves that are
further out make you happier.

342
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,190
So what's the furthest out
indifference curve that you

343
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,950
can achieve given your
budget constraint?

344
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,260
So to do that, let's actually
do an example.

345
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,250
Let's imagine, as last time,
your utility is the square

346
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,640
root of pizza times movies.

347
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,050
Once again, this has no
fundamental meaning, it's just

348
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,080
a mathematical representation
of your preferences.

349
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,310
So your preferences are
mathematically represented by

350
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,450
utility equals square root
of pizza times movies.

351
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,330
And let's have the same
budget constraint

352
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,120
that we have up here.

353
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:38,660
Income is $96, price of movies
is $8, price of pizza is $16.

354
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,300
Now let's go to the
next graph.

355
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,410
Figure 5-4.

356
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,570
What this does is put together
our indifference curve

357
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,670
analysis with our budget
constraint analysis.

358
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,680
It's a little complicated.

359
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:58,140
The budget constraint line is
the vertical line running from

360
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,340
a y-intercept of six to
an x-intercept of 12.

361
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:05,058
The-- not the vertical line, the
straight line running from

362
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:07,740
a y-intercept of six to
an x-intercept of 12.

363
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,720
That's your budget constraint.

364
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,369
We saw that before.

365
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:13,290
Then we have here a series
of indifference curves.

366
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,440
These curves are drawn-- these
are a mathematical

367
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,230
representative of this
utility function.

368
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,280
These are points among which
you're indifferent if you have

369
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,920
that utility function.

370
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,079
And what we see is that the best
you can do is to choose

371
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:32,620
point D. Point D, with six
movies and three pizzas--

372
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:39,070
OK, that should be p on the
y-axis, not C. It should be

373
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,600
movies on the x-axis and
pizzas on the y-axis.

374
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,130
That should be p
on the y-axis.

375
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:49,170
The best you can do is
to choose a point D.

376
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,470
Now, to see that.

377
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,790
And that gives utility.

378
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,820
What's the value of your
utility at point D?

379
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,890
We understand value's
meaningless, but just so we

380
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:00,096
can compare, what's the value
of your utility at point D?

381
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:02,620
The square root of 18.

382
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,760
The value of utility is the
square root of 6 times 3,

383
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:13,890
which is the square
root of 18.

384
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,720
Which is going to be square root
of two, or three times

385
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,500
square root of two, but we'll
just call it square root of 18

386
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,090
for comparison.

387
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,990
Now, let's talk about why that's
the best point for you.

388
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,470
Let's think about some
alternative points.

389
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,950
For instance, why is that
better than point E?

390
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,460

391
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,622
Somebody raise their hand and
tell me, why is point D better

392
00:18:35,622 --> 00:18:36,680
than point E?

393
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:36,900
Yeah?

394
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,870
AUDIENCE: E is unattainable
with your budget.

395
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,910
PROFESSOR: E would be better,
that'd be great.

396
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:45,270
We'd love eight movies
and four pizzas, but

397
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,560
we can't reach it.

398
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,710
So E's unattainable.

399
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,170
Why is it better than point A?

400
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,160
Point A you can afford.

401
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,660
So why's point E better
than point A?

402
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,890
You could afford point
A just like you can

403
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,960
afford point D. Yeah?

404
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,180
AUDIENCE: Because the utility's
only root 10.

405
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,980
PROFESSOR: Because what?

406
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,700
AUDIENCE: It's only root 10.

407
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,350
PROFESSOR: Yes, exactly, because
the utilitity's only

408
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,140
the square root of 10.

409
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,650
You're on a lower indifference
curve at point A. So it's true

410
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,110
you could afford point A,
but you're on a lower

411
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,795
indifference curve.

412
00:19:14,795 --> 00:19:17,590
Your utility's a lower value,
it's only square root of 10.

413
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:22,420
So point A is dominated by point
D. What about point C?

414
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:28,050
Well, point C you
have the same--

415
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,410
point C is just an inward shift
from point D, but here

416
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,530
that's a dominated choice.

417
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,480
Once again your utility's
lower.

418
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,220
It's the square root
of 4.5 times 2.2.

419
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,690
And basically that's dominated
because you could afford more.

420
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,200
So basically, the point is that
the point which will make

421
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,040
you happiest is the point at
which your indifference curve

422
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,490
is tangent to the budget
constraint.

423
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,440
Because that is the point of the
farthest out indifference

424
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,750
curve that you can reach given
your budget constraint.

425
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,610
The tangency of the indifference
curve and the

426
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,360
budget constraint is the point
which makes you best off given

427
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,985
your available budget and
the available prices.

428
00:20:04,985 --> 00:20:07,630

429
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,330
And that's the point where the
slope of the indifference

430
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,990
curve equals the slope of
the budget constraint.

431
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,490
The tangency is the point
where the slope of the

432
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,700
indifference curve equals
the slope of the budget

433
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,110
constraint.

434
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,570
Or, more relevantly--

435
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,280
OK, let me stop there.

436
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,850
That's the graphic intuition.

437
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,410
With a sloping indifference
curve because the slope of the

438
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,850
budget constraint is the
optimum, because by

439
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,640
definition, that is the point
of the furthest out

440
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,580
indifference curve you can
reach given your budget.

441
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,540
The point of tangency is the
point of equal slopes.

442
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,520
Are there questions about the
graphical analysis here?

443
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,270
This is very, very
important, so.

444
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:46,950
Yeah?

445
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,620
AUDIENCE: This is sort of about
the graphical analysis,

446
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,070
but if it only matters in terms
of the ordinal values of

447
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:55,858
the utility function and p and M
are always positive, does it

448
00:20:55,858 --> 00:20:57,230
matter if you got rid
of the square root?

449
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,210
Would anything change if
it was u equals pm?

450
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,700
Because the the marginal
rate of substitution,

451
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,080
transformation, all that would
still be the same, right?

452
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,180

453
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,920
PROFESSOR: In this particular
example, it would not.

454
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,390
So actually, you're asking
a great question.

455
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:15,720
Because it's ordinal, you can
typically do transformations

456
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,220
for the ranking of bundles.

457
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,290
You will always get the same
ranking with a monotone

458
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,260
transformation of the
utility function.

459
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,510
That's exactly right.

460
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:27,770

461
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,580
Later in the course, we'll show
different ways why the

462
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,940
functional form matters, and
I'll show you why I did square

463
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,780
root, because it's going
to turn out that

464
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,930
that's going to matter.

465
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,790
But for other things--
but for the ranking

466
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,530
bundles, you're right.

467
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,610
The ranking of bundles is
consistent with the

468
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,860
transformation.

469
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,970

470
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,170
So that's the graphical.

471
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,300
Now let's come to
the mathematical

472
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,080
derivation of this.

473
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,010
So let's talk about the
mathematics of utility

474
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:53,970
maximization.

475
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,790
Now what I'm going to do here
is, I'm going to do this sort

476
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,680
of casually, as is my wont.

477
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,730
Friday in section, you're
going to work on the

478
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,240
underlying calculus that lies
behind the mathematics that

479
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,640
I'm going to present here.

480
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:13,020
Now, let's talk about
what it means that

481
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,700
these slopes are equal.

482
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,610
Well, remember, what is-- does
anyone remember what the slope

483
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,590
of the indifference curve is?

484
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,150
What do we call the slope of
the indifference curve?

485
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:20,430
Yeah?

486
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,490
AUDIENCE: The MRS.

487
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,190
PROFESSOR: The MRS. The slope
of the indifference curve is

488
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:26,810
the marginal rate
of substitution.

489
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:30,210
Which is defined as what?

490
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,000
What is the marginal rate
of substitution?

491
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,450
The ratio of what?

492
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

493
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,982
PROFESSOR: No, the marginal
rate of substitution.

494
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,290
This is just about
preferences.

495
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,125
What's the marginal rate of
substitution defined as?

496
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,310
It's the ratio of
what to what?

497
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:44,810
Yeah?

498
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,074
AUDIENCE: The amount of one good
you have to get to give

499
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:47,310
up a unit of the other good.

500
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,810
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry?

501
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,872
AUDIENCE: The amount of one good
you have to get to give

502
00:22:49,872 --> 00:22:51,310
up a unit of the other good.

503
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,450
PROFESSOR: So graphically
that's what

504
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,665
it's defined as, exactly.

505
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,710
It's the slope of the
indifference curve.

506
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,400
Mathematically, what was it?

507
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,720
What was it in terms
of utility?

508
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,440
Does anyone remember?

509
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:00,680
Yeah.

510
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,190
AUDIENCE: The ratio
of the partials.

511
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,000
PROFESSOR: Ratio of the
marginal utilities.

512
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,210
In particular, it's the negative
of the marginal

513
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,110
utility of movies over the
marginal utility of pizza.

514
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,622
Remember, it's the negative of
the marginal utility of the

515
00:23:12,622 --> 00:23:14,950
x-axis over the marginal
utility of the y-axis.

516
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,630
So marginal rate of substitution
is the rate at

517
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,650
which you're willing to
substitute between movies and

518
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,700
pizza, which is a function of
your marginal utilities.

519
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,360
If your marginal utility for
movies is very high, then you

520
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,560
need a lot of pizzas.

521
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,190
Then you wouldn't trade a movie
unless you get a lot of

522
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,450
pizza for it.

523
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,930
If your marginal utility of
movies is very low, you'd be

524
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,630
happy to give up a movie
even for a small

525
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,970
fraction of a pizza.

526
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,400
So that's the marginal
rate of substitution.

527
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,370
That's about preferences only.

528
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:48,170
At the same time, we're saying
that that marginal rate of

529
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:53,060
substitution is equal to--

530
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:56,610
this slope is equal to the
slope of the budget

531
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,570
constraint.

532
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,200
Well, the slope of the budget
constraint we call the

533
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,630
marginal rate of transformation,
which is the

534
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,880
price ratio.

535
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,960

536
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,940
The slope of the budget
constraint is the negative of

537
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,610
the price ratio.

538
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,900
That's where you were sort of
one step ahead of us here.

539
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,320
So preferences give us this,
the marginal rate of

540
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,410
substitution.

541
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,810
The mechanics of the market give
us the marginal rate of

542
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,310
transformation.

543
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:31,390
And utility maximization gives
us that those are equal,

544
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,100
because they're equal
at that tangency.

545
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:40,180

546
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,910
At that tangency is where you
get to the highest possible

547
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,490
indifference curve.

548
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:52,790
So at the optimum, you get that
the ratio of marginal

549
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,400
utility equals the
ratio of prices.

550
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,360
Now, I want to try to see you
understand this a bit more

551
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,170
intuitively, given
this mathematics.

552
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,590
The way I like to think about
this is, think about the ratio

553
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:07,170
of the marginal utilities
as the marginal benefit.

554
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:13,630
So it's the benefit of another
movie in terms of pizza.

555
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,560
The marginal rate of
substitution is the benefit of

556
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,840
another movie in
terms of pizza.

557
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,340
It's how much you like that
next movie relative to how

558
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,590
much you like that next pizza.

559
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,605

560
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,020
The marginal rate of
transformation, the cost, is

561
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,710
the price of that next movie
relative to the price of that

562
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,350
next pizza.

563
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:34,500
So what we're saying here is
we're setting benefits equal

564
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,260
to the costs.

565
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,410
In particular, we're setting
marginal benefits equal to

566
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,740
marginal cost.

567
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,690
The marginal benefit, the
benefit to that next movie in

568
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:50,540
terms of pizza, has got to be
equal to the marginal cost,

569
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,820
the cost to you in terms
of that next

570
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,230
movie in terms of pizza.

571
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,415
And this notion that the optimum
will be where marginal

572
00:25:56,415 --> 00:25:58,610
benefit equals marginal
cost will pervade

573
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,910
through the whole course.

574
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:02,670
When we do firm maximization,
it'll be the same thing.

575
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:07,690
Any maximization we'll do in
this course, any optimization,

576
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,460
will be about equating
these margins.

577
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,180
Setting the marginal benefits
equal to marginal costs.

578
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,500
Now, this is different than
benefits equals cost, because

579
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,850
it's about the next unit.

580
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:22,205
It's saying, how do we feel
about that next movie compared

581
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,150
to the price of that
next movie.

582
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,100
Now, prices here we have
being constant.

583
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,310
You could imagine prices of
movies changing as you see

584
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,710
more, but that gets
complicated.

585
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,600
We'll worry about that later.

586
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,030
For now, the price
is constant.

587
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,300
But the marginal utilities
are not constant.

588
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,980
Marginal utilities are obviously
changing the more

589
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,130
moves you see.

590
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,830
Once again, with intuition,
you have to

591
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,240
develop your own intuition.

592
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,220
The way that I like to think
about this intuitively is to

593
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,590
actually rewrite this a little
bit, and rewrite it as saying

594
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,560
that the marginal utility of
movies over the price of

595
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,390
movies equals the marginal
utility of pizza over the

596
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,640
price of pizza.

597
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,390

598
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,470
At the optimum, this'll
be true.

599
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,340
I like this because to me this
term sort of says, look, the

600
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,845
bang for the buck has to be
the same across all goods.

601
00:27:09,845 --> 00:27:12,470

602
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:16,110
For each dollar of movie
expenditure, what's it buying?

603
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,870
What's that next dollar of movie
expenditure buying you?

604
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,780
This is saying, what's that
next dollar of pizza

605
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,230
expenditure buying you?

606
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,720
And they've got to be equal.

607
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,120
If the next dollar of movie
expenditure buys you a lot

608
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,720
more happiness than the next
dollar of pizza expenditure,

609
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,180
then you're not at
the right place.

610
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,985
You should shift your money and
spend more on movies and

611
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,830
less on pizza.

612
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,080
If the next dollar of pizza
expenditure buys you a lot

613
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,610
more happiness than the next
dollar of movie expenditure,

614
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,000
then you're not in the
right place either.

615
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,200
You should see fewer movies
and buy more pizza.

616
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,720
So basically, it's where the
marginal benefit to you--

617
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,600
the bang for the buck of that
next movie is the same as the

618
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,830
bang for the buck of
that next pizza.

619
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:01,580
So to see this, let's go back
to figure 5-4 and let's

620
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,230
actually think through the
mathematics of a couple of

621
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,110
these points.

622
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:20,550
Let's take point A. At point
A, you have two pizzas and

623
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,820
five movies.

624
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:28,990
So pizza equals two, movies
equals five at point A. So

625
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:35,230
utility is equal to square
root of 10 at point A.

626
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:39,390
Now, in particular, your
marginal utility for pizzas at

627
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,360
that point--

628
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,680
what's the marginal utility
for pizzas?

629
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,760
Well, we can differentiate.

630
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,630
That's the derivative of the
utility function with respect

631
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:50,230
to prices, du/dp.

632
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:56,710
Which is going to be 0.5 times
movies over the square root of

633
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:02,540
p times m, which at these values
is going to be one over

634
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,650
the square root of 10.

635
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,740
That's your marginal
utility of pizzas.

636
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:14,350
Your marginal utility of movies
is going to be du/dm,

637
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:21,020
which is going to be 0.5 times
p over square root of p times

638
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:31,740
m, which is going to be 2.5
over square root of 10.

639
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,990
So the marginal rate of
substitution between

640
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:40,350
these two is 2.5.

641
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:47,130
The marginal rate of
substitution, 2.5.

642
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,570
What does that mean
intuitively?

643
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,040
Can someone tell me what that
means intuitively, the

644
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,070
marginal rate of substitution
is 2.5?

645
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,680
What does that mean?

646
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,580
Someone explain that like you'd
explain it to someone

647
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,330
who's speaking English.

648
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,220
What does it mean that
the marginal rate of

649
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,350
substitution is 2.5?

650
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:02,890
Yeah?

651
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,260
AUDIENCE: You'd give up one
pizza for 2.5 movies.

652
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:06,640
Yes.

653
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,820
No, actually, the opposite.

654
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,420
You'd give up two
and 1/2 pizzas--

655
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:14,746
the marginal rate of
substitution is 2.5--

656
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:17,662

657
00:30:17,662 --> 00:30:19,620
no, that's right.

658
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,320
You would give up 2.5--

659
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,440
one second, let's make sure
I have this right.

660
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,510

661
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:36,305
Right, so you would give up one
pizza to see 2 and 1/2--

662
00:30:36,305 --> 00:30:37,580
no, it's the other way around.

663
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:43,040

664
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,060
You're getting a lot of pizza
and not enough movies.

665
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,640
So you would give up two
and 1/2 pizzas to

666
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,890
get one more movie.

667
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,310
This is confusing, OK?

668
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:55,000
You'd give up two and 1/2 pizzas
to get one more movie.

669
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,070
That's what it means.

670
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,700
You would give up two and 1/2
pizzas to see one more movie,

671
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,100
and why is that?

672
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,150
Why at a point like A would you
give up two and 1/2 pizzas

673
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,120
to see one more movie?

674
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,597
Yeah?

675
00:31:04,597 --> 00:31:06,982
AUDIENCE: Well, if you just look
at the line tangent to

676
00:31:06,982 --> 00:31:09,844
the indifference curve
at A, it's really

677
00:31:09,844 --> 00:31:11,280
not a downward slope.

678
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,970
PROFESSOR: It's really steep,
which means what?

679
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,850
AUDIENCE: Which means you get
a lot more benefit--like you

680
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,530
don't care if you
give up a lot of

681
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,700
pizzas to see more movies.

682
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,820
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

683
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,470
Actually, that's a great way to
bring the graphics and the

684
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,830
intuition together.

685
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,990
Here's thinking of
it intuitively.

686
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,670
I'm getting a lot of pizza
at point A. I'm not

687
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,970
getting a lot of movies.

688
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,990
So I would happily give
up a lot of pizza

689
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,790
to get my next movie.

690
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,210
What you pointed out is the
tie to the graphics here.

691
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:43,940
The indifference curve is very
steep at that point through A.

692
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,310
A steep indifference curve in
that way means I don't really

693
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:53,150
care a whole lot at this point
about how many pizzas I get,

694
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,650
but I care a lot about
getting more movies.

695
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:02,010
So at a point like A where
it's very steep, you are

696
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:05,960
willing to give up two and 1/2
pizzas to see a movie.

697
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,050
But what do you have
to give up?

698
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,250
What's the market telling
you you have to

699
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:11,370
give up to see a movie?

700
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,910
How much pizza do you actually
have to give up to see a movie

701
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,340
in practice?

702
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,720
You're willing to give up two
and 1/2 pizzas to see a movie,

703
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,420
but how many pizzas do you
actually have to give up?

704
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,350
AUDIENCE: 1/2.

705
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,330
PROFESSOR: 1/2 a pizza
to see a movie.

706
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,140
So that can't be the optimum.

707
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,160
You're willing to give up two
and 1/2 pizzas to see a movie,

708
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,710
but you only have to give up
1/2 a pizza to see a movie.

709
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,890
So you can't be at
the right place.

710
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:33,260
You should be changing your
consumption bundle.

711
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,500
You should be changing your
consumption bundle, because

712
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,530
the market is only asking for
1/2 a pizza to see a movie,

713
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,846
but you're willing to
give up two and 1/2

714
00:32:39,846 --> 00:32:41,090
pizzas to see a movie.

715
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:45,470
So at a point like A, you're
clearly not at the optimum.

716
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:48,550
Because you are willing
to make a trade.

717
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,980
Remember, we talked about-- we
can go all the way back to the

718
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,170
first lecture.

719
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,690
The key point was-- the first
or second lecture--

720
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:58,390
inefficiency happens
when trades aren't

721
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:01,020
made that people value.

722
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,300
Here's a trade that you value.

723
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,030
You're willing to give up two
and 1/2 pizzas to see a movie.

724
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,590
The market only wants 1/2
a pizza to see a movie.

725
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,550
You're not making a trade you
value, so that's not the

726
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,200
efficient outcome.

727
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,740
Likewise, let's do the same
mathematics at point B. Well,

728
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,390
at point B, if you do the math
and work it out, you see that

729
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:22,190
the marginal utility of
pizza is five over

730
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,340
square root of ten.

731
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,160
The marginal utility of
movies is 0.5 over the

732
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,360
square root of 10.

733
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,250
So the MRS is 0.1.

734
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,960
At this point, you'd only be
willing to give up 0.1 pizzas

735
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,730
to see a movie.

736
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,835
At a point like B,
the indifference

737
00:33:36,835 --> 00:33:38,720
curve is very flat.

738
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,340
You're only willing to give up
0.1 pizzas to see a movie.

739
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,590

740
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:49,170
But remember, the market is
willing to say, look--

741
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,810
you can flip it around, the
market's willing to say, look,

742
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,060
you can get a movie.

743
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:57,235

744
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,670
You're only willing to give up
0.1 pizzas to see a movie.

745
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,720
Well, that means clearly that
you have too many movies and

746
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,190
not enough pizza.

747
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:12,010
You're clearly at that point
happy to say, wow, you mean

748
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:15,730
that I can gain a whole pizza by
just giving up two movies?

749
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:19,850
Heck, I'd be willing to give up
10 movies to get a pizza.

750
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,650
At the point I'm at right there,
I'd be willing to give

751
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,520
up 10 movies to get a pizza.

752
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,590
You're telling me we only
have to give up two

753
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,239
movies to get a pizza?

754
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:26,960
Great.

755
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,280
I'm going to do that trade.

756
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,380
I'm going to move back towards
point D. So that's why this

757
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:36,719
idea of what you're willing to
do, which is the MRS, and what

758
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,170
the market's making you do, you
want to equilibrate those

759
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:44,489
to decide how much you
want to consume.

760
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:47,570
Now, obviously a point like--

761
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:51,710
let's talk about point C.
Point C is interesting,

762
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:55,070
because at point
C, what's true?

763
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,139
The marginal rate of
substitution is equal to the

764
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:00,460
marginal rate of transformation
at point C. The

765
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,630
slope of the indifference
curve and the budget

766
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:05,980
constraint are equal.

767
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,160
That's why you have to check
two conditions for

768
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,330
optimization.

769
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,620
First of all, those slopes
have to be equal.

770
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,660
Second of all, you've got
to spend all your money.

771
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,040
So it's true there's a whole
host of points-- in fact,

772
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,330
there's a vector running through
CDE, all which are

773
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:25,520
points where the margin rate
of substitution equals the

774
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,880
margin rate of transformation.

775
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,630
But only D is optimal, because
you also have to

776
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,770
remember more is better.

777
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:33,700
You never want to leave
money on the table.

778
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,770
So the two conditions you have
to meet is that you're at the

779
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:42,190
point where your desired
trade-off between pizzas and

780
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:46,460
movies is the same as the
market's, and where you're

781
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,050
spending all your budget.

782
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,890
And that's the optimum.

783
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,140
OK, questions about that?

784
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,830

785
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:56,820
So that's basically how we
think about optimization.

786
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,980
That's how we think about
consumers making their

787
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,940
decisions deciding between
consuming pizzas and movies.

788
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,490
Now, let's come back-- however,
this is a particular

789
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,190
case we've looked at.

790
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,530
This is a case in particular
where we've imposed that

791
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:12,120
there's an interior solution.

792
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,910
In fact, in practice you could
end up in these kinds of

793
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,560
choices with corner solutions.

794
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:25,600
So let's take a look at the
last figure, figure 5-5.

795
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:31,480
We've chosen a case where your
optimal bundle includes both

796
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,730
pizza and movies.

797
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:37,080

798
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,920
But you could imagine
a situation where

799
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,370
your optimal bundle--

800
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:43,945
and once again, that should be
a p, not a c in figure 5-5,

801
00:36:43,945 --> 00:36:46,420
that should be p
on the y-axis--

802
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,960
where your optimal
bundle includes

803
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,470
only one or the other.

804
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:54,300
So this is a particular case--
we have the same budget line

805
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:59,560
as before, which is you're
trading off pizza and movies.

806
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,860
You have an income of 96, the
price of pizzas is 16, the

807
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,460
price of movies is 8.

808
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,400
So same budget line as before.

809
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,040
But now your indifference curves
look very different.

810
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,750
Now your preferences are such
that you've got these linear

811
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,180
difference curves of the
form I1, I2, I3.

812
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,720

813
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,030
You've got these linear
indifference curves.

814
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,780
What that means is
you've got--

815
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:25,930
these indifference curves mean
that you have a constant rate

816
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:28,580
at which you're willing to trade
off pizza for movies.

817
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,245
If we go back to figure 5.4,
the rate at which you're

818
00:37:31,245 --> 00:37:33,450
willing to trade off pizza
for movies changes.

819
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,390
Your preferences
are such that--

820
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,790
because the square root function
as pointed out--

821
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:41,960
your preferences are such that
you are willing to make

822
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,040
different rates of trade
at different amounts.

823
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,430
In figure 5-5, your preferences
are constant, no

824
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,000
matter how many movies or pizzas
you have. You're always

825
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,850
willing to make that trade-off
at the same rate.

826
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:00,230
Well, in that case you can end
up with a corner solution,

827
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:10,370
where in fact, you're going
to consume only six

828
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,540
pizzas and no movies.

829
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,580
And why is that?

830
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,930
That's because this is a
person who loves pizza

831
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:18,630
relative to movies.

832
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,460
It's a very flat indifference
curve.

833
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,520
They love pizza relative
to movies.

834
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:29,140
And they love pizza so much
relative to movies that given

835
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,950
the prices they face, they'll
just go ahead and choose six

836
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:35,380
pizzas and no movies.

837
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,330
So that's a corner solution.

838
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:39,330
So mathematically, as you'll
go through a section on

839
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:44,360
Friday, you're going to have to
check for corner solutions.

840
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,520
You may solve these problems
and end up with negative

841
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,640
quantities and be befuddled
about what happens.

842
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,030
Well, if an answer looks
wrong, it is wrong.

843
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,460
If you solve problems with
negative quantities, that's

844
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,670
probably because there's a
corner solution to the

845
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:59,330
problem, and actually the
optimal quantity is to have

846
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,230
zero of one thing and spend
your entire budget on

847
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:04,240
something else.

848
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,490
Questions about that?

849
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,870

850
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:15,700
So now let's think about
applying this to the kinds of

851
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,680
decisions that you
all have to make.

852
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,340
So I talked about this
particular example of pizza

853
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,270
and movies.

854
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:27,500
And in fact, you might say,
well, that's sort of

855
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,150
unrealistic.

856
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:33,120
Gee, I spend my budget
on lots of things,

857
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,960
and how do I do this?

858
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,460
Well, in practice, what you'd
have to do is you'd have to

859
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,060
draw a multi-dimensional
graph and solve a

860
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,840
multi-dimensional problem.

861
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,270
And that's a bear.

862
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:44,080
But in practice, in fact, we can
often think about breaking

863
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,220
down the choices we make
into pairs of choices.

864
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,920
In practice, you could think
about saying, look--

865
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:56,440
many people do what a lot of
psychologists call mental

866
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:06,400
accounting, where basically they
say, look, yes, I have a

867
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,550
whole budget and lots
of things I can buy.

868
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,810
But in fact, I like to think
of my budget in sort of

869
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:11,360
subcategories.

870
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,790
I think of a certain amount
I'm willing to spend on

871
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,720
entertainment and a
certain amount I'm

872
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,200
willing to spend on food.

873
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,610
And I take my budget and
I mentally put it

874
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,710
in different buckets.

875
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,030
And within each of those
buckets, you can then do the

876
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:29,240
same kind of optimization
problem that we've done here.

877
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:33,120
So even though in reality we
choose across a whole host of

878
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:38,200
goods, in practice what you're
going to see is that people

879
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:44,290
will do this kind of mental
accounting, where they sort of

880
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:48,150
divide their goods into
different buckets and optimize

881
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,400
within each of those buckets.

882
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,700

883
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:57,100
What this means in practice is
that in fact, if we now stop

884
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,640
for a second and think about
the government, and how it

885
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,370
affects our consumption
decisions, what this means is

886
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,870
that in practice,
the government--

887
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,100
so, one way we typically of
the government affecting

888
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:09,810
consumption decisions is through
the power of taxation.

889
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:13,120
So let's say for example,
the government decided

890
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,790
that pizzas were bad.

891
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:17,190
They caused obesity.

892
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,840
That there's too much obesity
because people are eating too

893
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:24,660
much pizza, and we need to
deal with that through a

894
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:28,550
government policy that
involves taxation.

895
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:31,130
Somebody talk me through the
analysis of how we'd think

896
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:36,460
about analyzing a tax on pizza
given these diagrams.

897
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,970
Let's go to figure 5-4.

898
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:43,480

899
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:49,780
And imagine I said that
we're going to place

900
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,920
a 50% tax on pizza.

901
00:41:51,920 --> 00:42:00,040
So we're going to say that every
dollar you pay on pizza,

902
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,150
you're going to have to pay
$0.50 to the government.

903
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,256
Because we're really
worried people are

904
00:42:04,256 --> 00:42:06,180
eating too much pizza.

905
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:09,210
What would that do the
budget constraint?

906
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:09,640
Yeah.

907
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,464
AUDIENCE: Well, effectively
you're increasing

908
00:42:10,464 --> 00:42:12,540
the price of pizza.

909
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,604
PROFESSOR: Effectively you're
increasing the price of pizza

910
00:42:13,604 --> 00:42:14,260
to the consumer.

911
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,484
AUDIENCE: The budget
constraint would

912
00:42:15,484 --> 00:42:17,260
shift down like this.

913
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,350
PROFESSOR: It's actually going
to have the same effect as we

914
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:20,920
saw in figure 5-2.

915
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,620
In fact, I've just replicated
figure 5-2.

916
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:32,640
Because in figure 5-2, the price
of pizza went up by 50%,

917
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:40,350
from $16 to $24.

918
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:43,020
That's the same thing that the
government's just done.

919
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,460
It's raised the price of pizza
effectively from $16 a pizza

920
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:49,140
to $24 because instead of paying
your $16, you're also

921
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,060
going to pay $8 to the
government in tax.

922
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,070
So what's that going to do?

923
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:58,440
That is going to, in general,
lower consumption of pizza.

924
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,260
So that kind of price increase
is going to, in general, lower

925
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,510
the consumption of pizza.

926
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:05,440
So the government has tried
to accomplish its goal by

927
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,750
shifting people away from pizza
towards movies, away

928
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:11,340
from pizza toward
other things.

929
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,240
Yeah?

930
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,520
AUDIENCE: Would it be meaningful
to say that it also

931
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,040
affects the utility curves?

932
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,870
PROFESSOR: It would not be
meaningful, actually--

933
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:24,830
it will affect your
optimal choice.

934
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:26,980
In general, you will choose
a different amount

935
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,570
of pizza and movies.

936
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:28,920
We'll talk about
that next time.

937
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,440
But it's very important, it
would not be right to say it

938
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,800
affects utility.

939
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,900
Utility is like what you're
born with, it's an innate

940
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,350
concept about your underlying
preferences.

941
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,730
However, you're actually getting
to my point, which is

942
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:44,880
in fact, the way economists
typically think about this is

943
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,230
the government can't affect
your preferences.

944
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:48,700
But in fact, if people do
mental accounting, the

945
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,040
government maybe can affect
your preferences.

946
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,410
So let's say that basically the
way I think about it is,

947
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:56,600
let's say I think I have a
budget for food and I have a

948
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,430
budget for entertainment.

949
00:43:58,430 --> 00:43:59,770
And let's say I think my budget
for entertainment's

950
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:00,870
pretty small because
I'm low income.

951
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:03,100
I've gotta have a
budget for food.

952
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,490
And so let's say I put pizza
in my budget for food, so I

953
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:09,000
allocate some of my budget
for food to pizza.

954
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,690
And the government can then
cause me to eat less

955
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,110
pizza by taxing it.

956
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:14,960
But what if somehow the
government could get me to

957
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,110
think of pizza differently?

958
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:18,670
What if somehow the government
could get me to think of pizza

959
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:20,590
as entertainment?

960
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:23,300
And suddenly I put it in that
bucket, where I'm trading it

961
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,050
off not against other food, but
against the fact that I

962
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:27,180
want to see a movie and I
want to download stuff

963
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,600
from iTunes, et cetera.

964
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,460
Maybe then I'd buy less pizza at
the same price because I'm

965
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,610
putting it in the bucket where
I have less money.

966
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:35,970
So in other words,
we've imagined a

967
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:38,750
world with two goods.

968
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,083
And the only way you can affect
the choice across those

969
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:42,880
two goods is to lower your
income or your price.

970
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:48,030
But in fact, if people have lots
of different bundles of

971
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:50,340
goods, somehow I could shift you
mentally from considering

972
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,820
pizza in a bucket where you have
a lot of money to putting

973
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,090
pizza in a bucket where you
don't have as much money.

974
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:57,490
I can lower your consumption
of pizza without affecting

975
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:02,240
prices, without an obtrusive
government tax policy.

976
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,020
This is the kind of thing
that we call in

977
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,340
economic policy a nudge.

978
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,990

979
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:13,660
And there's a new book called
Nudge by Richard Thaler, who's

980
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:16,440
a famous behavioral economist,
basically bringing psychology

981
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,610
into economics.

982
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:20,110
There's this very important
field now in economics called

983
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:27,770
behavioral economics, which is
all about, how can we bring

984
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:30,480
the lessons of psychology
into economics?

985
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,090
We don't do that in 14.01.

986
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:34,310
14.01's all about, we assume
everybody's these perfectly

987
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:37,630
rational people who would never
really be fooled into

988
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:38,800
thinking about pizza differently
just because of

989
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,220
what the government told them.

990
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,610
But in fact, in reality people
think about things differently

991
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:46,070
based on the kinds of
information they have. And

992
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:49,510
given that tax policies can feel
very intrusive-- imagine

993
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:51,820
some of you are like, wow,
they're raising my pizza to

994
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,670
$24, that seems very
intrusive.

995
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,680
If the government could somehow
through nudging you to

996
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,220
think about pizza differently
change your pizza consumption,

997
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:00,940
that might be a much more
acceptable and palatable

998
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,480
policy to many people.

999
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,110
And that's the kind of role the
government can play, or

1000
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:08,340
policy-makers can play, is not
just by changing your prices

1001
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,880
or income, but by actually
changing how you categorize

1002
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,160
things mentally, they can change
the choices you make.

1003
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,410
