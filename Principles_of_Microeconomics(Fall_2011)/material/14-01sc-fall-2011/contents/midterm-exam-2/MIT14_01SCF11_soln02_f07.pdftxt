1.  True/False Questions (TOTAL: 20  points): 

In  this  section, write whether  each  statement  is True or False.  Please  fully  explain  your 
answer, using a diagram if appropriate. No credit will be given for an answer without an 
explanation. 

(a)  (5  points)  As  long  as  the  marginal  cost  of  production  is  greater  than  the  average 
variable cost, then the average variable cost is increasing. 

True.  By  the  definition  of  the  average  variable  cost,  we  can  find  that  as  long  as 
MC AC ,  dAC  > 0 .
> 
dq 

(b)  (5 points)  In a perfectly competitive market with constant  long  run marginal cost,  the 
consumer will bear all the taxation burden. 

True.  This  is  because  the  supply  curve  is  a  flat  line,  no  matter  what  the  demand  is, 
supply is inelastic. 

(c)  (5  points)  In  a  perfectly  competitive  market,  firms  take  the  market  price  as  a  given, 
which implies that the market demand is infinitely elastic. 

False.  In a  competitive market,  firms are assumed  to be  very  small,  therefore  they are 
assumed  to  have  no  influence  on  the  market  price  –  like  if  they  faced  an  infinitely 
elastic  demand  at  the  market  price  level.  Nevertheless,  the  market  demand  can  be 
elastic or rigid. 

(d)  (5  points)  In  an  exchange  economy,  no  individual  will  ever  prefer  a  point  inside  the 
utility possibilities frontier to a point on the utility possibilities frontier.  

False. The points on the Pareto frontier are such that one cannot improve the situation 
of one  individual without making someone else worse off – we can move  to an  interior 
point and make one individual better off, just not the whole society.

Long Questions: 

2.  (15 points) Ricardo produces widgets, using as  inputs  labor  (L) and machines (K). His 
production function is given by the following equation: 

q = 10K2/3  + L1/2 

(a)  (4  points)  What  type  of  returns  to  scale  (increasing/constant/decreasing)  does 
Ricardo’s production function exhibit? 

The production function exhibits decreasing returns to scale: 

F(2K,2L)  =  10(2K)2/3  +  (2L)1/2  =  10*22/3K2/3  +  21/2L1/2  <  2*[10K2/3  + 
L1/2]=2F(K,L) 

At  the  end  of  last  year,  Ricardo  bought  his  only  machine  for  $1,000.  He  will  use  this 
machine  for  5  years,  after  which  the machine  will  have  no  value.  Ricardo  will  calculate 
depreciation  linearly  (depreciation  will  be  20%  of  the  total  value  of  the  machine  per 
year). This machine has no other use besides Ricardo’s production of widgets, and, at this 
moment, Ricardo cannot buy any more machines. 

(b)  (4  points)  What  is  Ricardo’s  annual  fixed  cost  of  production?  Is  the  fixed  cost 
sunk or not? Explain. 

FC = 0.2 * 1000 = 200 
All  the  fixed  cost  is  sunk,  as  Ricardo  already  paid  it  in  the  past  and  cannot 
recover  it.  There  is  no  opportunity  cost,  as  the machine  has  no  other  use  besides 
Ricardo’s production of widgets. 

(c)  (4  points)  What  is  Ricardo’s  demand  for  labor  as  a  function  of  the  quantity  he 
wants to produce annually? 

q = 10 * 12/3 + L1/2 

Ld 

⎧(q − 10)2 , if  q ≥ 10 
= ⎨ 
0, if  q < 10 
⎩ 

(d)  (3  points)  Assuming  that  wage  equals  1,  what  is  Ricardo’s  annual  total  cost 
function?
 
⎧q 2  − 20q + 300, if  q ≥ 10

TC  = ⎨

3.  (10  points)  Sally’s  firm  produces  granola  bars  with  a  fixed  cost  of  10  (this  cost  is 
already sunk). Her variable cost function is VC = q2 + 2q. 

(a)  (4  points)  Assuming  the  market  for  granola  bars  is  competitive,  derive  Sally’s 
supply function? 

Supply: P = MC ↔ P = 2qs + 2 

(b)  (6  points)  What  is  Sally’s  surplus  if  the  market  price  is  6?  What  is  her  profit? 
Does she want to stay in this market? Explain. 

If  P  =  6,  q  =  2.  Producer  surplus  =  Revenue  –  Variable  Costs  =  12  –  8  =  4.  
 
Profit = Revenue – Total Costs = 12 – 10 - 8 = -6. 
 
Sally would want  to stay  in  the market, even  though she makes a  loss, as  that will  
 
minimize  her  losses  –  she  will  be  able  to  cover  all  her  variable  costs  and  still  
 
make some extra money, which will lower the loss she would have due to her sunk 
 
costs.

4.  (24  points)  Suppose  the  demand  function  for  corn  is    Qd  = 10 − 2 p  ,  and  supply 
function  is  Qs  = 3 p − 5 . The  government  is  concerned  that  the market  equilibrium  price 
of  corn  is  too  low  and  would  like  to  implement  a  price  support  policy  to  protect  the 
farmers.  By  implementing  the  price  support  policy,  the  government  sets  a  support  price 
and  purchases  the  extra  supply  at  the  support  price.  In  this  case,  the  government  sets  the 
support price p s  = 4 . 

(a) 	  (4  points)  Calculate  the  original  market  equilibrium  price  and  quantity  in 
absence of the price support policy. 

The original equilibrium price is  p0  = 3 . And the equilibrium quantity is 4. 

(b) 	  (3 points) At the support price  p s  = 4 , find the quantity supplied by the farmers, 
the  quantity  demanded  by  the  market,  and  the  quantity  purchased  by  the 
government.  

When  the  price  is  ps  = 4  ,  the  demand  is  2,  and  supply  will  be  7,  so  the 
government need to buy 5. 

(c) 	  (3 points) Draw a diagram to show the change in the producer surplus due to the 
implementation of the price support policy. Calculate the change in the producer 
surplus. 

The producer's gain is

(d) 	  (3  points)  Draw  a  diagram  to  show  the  change  in  the  consumer  surplus  due  to 
the  implementation  of  the  price  support  policy.  Calculate  the  change  in  the 
consumer surplus.  

The  loss  to  consumer  is  2(4 − 3) + (4 − 2)(4 − 3) / 2 = 3 ,  which  is  area  A+B  in 
the following graph.

 (8  points)  Suppose  now  the  government  switches  from  price  support  policy  to

5.  (15  points)  Molly’s  company  produces  knee  warmers  according  to  the  following 
production function: 

q = (K-8)1/4L1/4 

(a)  (4 points) Assuming that the unit cost of capital (r) and the unit wage (w) are both 
equal  to 1, derive Molly’s demand for  inputs—capital and  labor, respectively—as 
a function of her choice of output (q). 

Cost minimization will lead to the following two conditions: 

K − 8

⎪

⎧  Ld  = q 2
⇔ ⎨K d  = 8 + q 2

⎩

(b)  (2  points)  Show  that Molly’s  long  run  total  cost  function  is  given  by  C(q)  =  8  + 
2q2. 

C(q) = C(Kd,Ld)=8 + 2q2 

The demand for knee warmers is given by P = 40 - Qd. There are no costs of entry or exit 
for  a  firm  on  the  market  for  knee  warmers.  Any  firm  in  this  market  will  have  access  to 
the same technology as Molly. 

(c)  (6  points) What  will  the  price  be  in  the  long  run  in  this market?  How much  will 
each firm produce in this market in the long run.  

In the long run, P = Min LAC 

Min LAC: LAC = LMC 
 
8/q + 2q = 4q 
 
qMin LAC = 2 

Price in the long run = Min LAC = 8 

(d)  (3 points) How many firms will there be in this market in the long run? 

If  Price  =  8,  looking  at  the  demand  function,  we  see  that  Q  =  32,  which  implies 
that on the long run, we will have 16 firms in this market.

6.  (15  points) Consider  a  two  person  economy  consisting  of Ann  and Bob  only. Both  of 
them only consume    x  and  y . Ann's utility over  these  two goods  is U A ( x A , y A ) =  x A y A 
2 
2 y B  .  Initially,  Ann  is  endowed  with  9  units  of x  , 
and  Bob's  utility  is U B ( x B , y B ) =  x B 
zero units of y , and Bob is endowed with 6 units of  y ,  zero units  of  x . 

(a)  (2  points)  Write  Ann’s  marginal  rate  of  substitution  in  terms  of  x A  and  y A  and 
Bob’s marginal rate of substitution in terms of	  x B  and  y B  .

(c)  (8 points) Find  the general equilibrium allocation of x and y among Ann and Bob 
of the above economy 

For Ann, her utility maximization problem is 
max x A y B 
2
s.t.  x A  +  py A  =  9 
it's ready to give the solution  x ∗ 
A  = 3  ;
 
For Bob, his utility maximization problem is 
 
max x B  y B 
2
s.t.  x B  +  py B  =  6 p 
∗ = 2  ;
 
this gives the solution  yB 
Thus the final solution for this is:
