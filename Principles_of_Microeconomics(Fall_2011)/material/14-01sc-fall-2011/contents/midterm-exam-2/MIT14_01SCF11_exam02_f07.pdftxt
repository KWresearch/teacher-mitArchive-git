1.  True/False Questions (TOTAL: 20  points): 

In  this  section, write whether  each  statement  is True or False.  Please  fully  explain  your 
answer, using a diagram if appropriate. No credit will be given for an answer without an 
explanation. 

(a)  (5  points)  As  long  as  the  marginal  cost  of  production  is  greater  than  the  average 
variable cost, the average variable cost is increasing. 

(b)  (5 points)  In a perfectly competitive market with constant  long  run marginal cost,  the 
consumer will bear all the taxation burden.

(c)  (5  points)  In  a  perfectly  competitive  market,  firms  take  the  market  price  as  a  given, 
which implies that the market demand is infinitely elastic. 

(d)  (5  points)  In  an  exchange  economy,  no  individual  will  ever  prefer  a  point  inside  the 
utility possibilities frontier to a point on the utility possibilities frontier.

Long Questions: 

2.  (15 points) Ricardo produces widgets, using as  inputs  labor  (L) and machines (K). His 
production function is given by the following equation: 

q = 10K2/3  + L1/2 

(a)  (4  points)  What  type  of  returns  to  scale  (increasing/constant/decreasing)  does 
Ricardo’s production function exhibit? Explain.  

At  the  end  of  last  year,  Ricardo  bought  his  only  machine  for  $1,000.  He  will  use  this 
machine  for  5  years,  after  which  the machine  will  have  no  value.  Ricardo  will  calculate 
depreciation  linearly  (depreciation  will  be  20%  of  the  total  value  of  the  machine  per 
year). This machine has no other use besides Ricardo’s production of widgets, and, at this 
moment, Ricardo cannot buy any more machines. 

(b)  (4  points)  What  is  Ricardo’s  annual  fixed  cost  of  production?  Is  the  fixed  cost 
sunk or not? Explain.

(c)  (4  points)  What  is  Ricardo’s  demand  for  labor  as  a  function  of  the  quantity  he 
wants to produce annually? 

(d)  (3  points)  Assuming  that  wage  equals  1,  what  is  Ricardo’s  annual  total  cost 
function?

3.  (10  points)  Sally’s  firm  produces  granola  bars  with  a  fixed  cost  of  10  (this  cost  is 
already sunk). Her variable cost function is VC = q2 + 2q. 

(a)  (4  points)  Assuming  the  market  for  granola  bars  is  competitive,  derive  Sally’s 
supply function? 

(b)  (6  points)  What  is  Sally’s  surplus  if  the  market  price  is  6?  What  is  her  profit? 
Does she want to stay in this market? Explain.

4.  (24  points)  Suppose  the  demand  function  for  corn  is  Qd  = 10 − 2 p  ,  and  supply 
function is Qs  = 3 p − 5 . The government is concerned that the market equilibrium price of 
corn is too low and would like to implement a price support policy to protect the farmers. 
By  implementing  the  price  support  policy,  the  government  sets  a  support  price  and 
purchases  the  extra  supply  at  the  support  price.  In  this  case,  the  government  sets  the 
support price p s  = 4 . 

(a) 	  (4  points)  Calculate  the  original  market  equilibrium  price  and  quantity  in 
absence of the price support policy. 

(b) 	  (3 points) At the support price  p s  = 4 , find the quantity supplied by the farmers, 
the  quantity  demanded  by  the  market,  and  the  quantity  purchased  by  the 
government.

(c) 	  (3 points) Draw a diagram to show the change in the producer surplus due to the 
implementation of the price support policy. Calculate the change in the producer 
surplus. 

(d) 	

 (3  points) Draw  a  diagram  to  show  the  change  in  the  consumer  surplus  due  to 
the  implementation  of  the  price  support  policy.  Calculate  the  change  in  the 
consumer surplus.  

(e) 	  (3  points)  Calculate  the  cost  to  the  government  to  implement  the  price  support 
policy. Draw a diagram to show the government cost.

(f)	

 (8  points)  Suppose  now  the  government  switches  from  price  support  policy  to 
subsidy  policy.  For  each  unit  of  corn  produced,  the  government  subsidizes  the 
farmer    s =  5
3  .  Find  the  new  equilibrium  price  under  this  subsidy  policy.  How 
much  money  will  the  government  have  to  spend  in  order  to  implement  this 
subsidy policy?

5.  (15  points)  Molly’s  company  produces  knee  warmers  according  to  the  following 
production function: 

q = (K-8)1/4L1/4 

(a)  (4 points) Assuming that the unit cost of capital (r) and the unit wage (w) are both 
equal  to 1, derive Molly’s demand for  inputs—capital and  labor, respectively—as 
a function of her choice of output (q). 

(b)  (2  points)  Show  that Molly’s  long  run  total  cost  function  is  given  by  C(q)  =  8  + 
2q2.

The demand for knee warmers is given by P = 40 - Qd. There are no costs of entry or exit 
for  a  firm  on  the  market  for  knee  warmers.  Any  firm  in  this  market  will  have  access  to 
the same technology as Molly. 

(c)  (6  points) What  will  the  price  be  in  the  long  run  in  this market?  How much  will 
each firm produce in this market in the long run.  

(d)  (3 points) How many firms will there be in this market in the long run?

6.  (15  points)  Consider  a  two-person  economy  consists  of  Ann  and  Bob.  Both  of  them 
only  consume  x   and  y .  Ann's  utility  over  these  two  goods  is U A ( x A , y A ) =  x A y A 
2  and 
2 y B .  Initially, Ann  is endowed with 9 units of x  and zero 
Bob's utility  is U B ( x B , y B ) =  x B 
units of y ; Bob is endowed with 6 units of  y  and  zero units  of  x . 

(a)  (2  points)  Write  Ann’s  marginal  rate  of  substitution  in  terms  of  x A  and  y A  and 
Bob’s marginal rate of substitution in terms of  x B  and  y B  . 

(b)  (5 points) Derive the equation for the contract curve.
