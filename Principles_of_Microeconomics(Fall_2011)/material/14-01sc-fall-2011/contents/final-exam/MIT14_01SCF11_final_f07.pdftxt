1.  True/False Questions (TOTAL: 20  points): 

In  this  section, write whether  each  statement  is True or False.  Please  fully  explain  your 
answer, using a diagram if appropriate. No credit will be given for an answer without an 
explanation. 

(a)  (5  points)  After  Professor  Wheaton  promises  that  no  one  would  fail,  students  never 
study  and  turn  in  problem  sets  again.  This  is  an  example  of  adverse  selection 
problem. 

(b)  (5  points)  When  a  firm  chooses  among  different  projects,  the  one  which  has  the 
highest present value is always the one with the highest yield rate.

(c)  (5 points) If the government guarantees a binding price floor for agricultural output 
by purchasing any surplus, then the demand for farm labor will be more elastic. 

(d)  (5 points) Exploitation Mining Co. is the only employer in the remote town of 
Uranium City and pays its workers $10.00/hour. If the government forces the 
company to raise its wage by a small amount—say to $10.10/hour—then it will hire 
more workers.

(e)  (5 points) A factory that pollutes a river has negative externalities on residents along  
the river. If the factory and residents can negotiate, an efficient result can be achieved 
only if the property right of the river is assigned to the residents.

Long Questions: 

3. (25 points) Suppose that Intel has a monopoly in the market for computer chips. In 
order to produce X computer chips, it costs Intel C(X) = 2X2 . 

(a)  (2 points) Find the marginal cost of producing a computer chip for Intel. 

(b)  (6  points)  The  demand  for  computer  chips  is  X D  = 12 − 0.25P .  Find  the  level  of 
output that maximizes Intel’s profits. What price is Intel charging?

(c)  (4 points) What level of output would maximize total surplus in the computer chip 
market? 

(d)  (4  points)  Suppose  the  government  knew  the  demand  and  production  functions. 
Find  a  price  regulation  the  government  could  impose  that  would  induce  Intel  to 
maximize total surplus, i.e., produce the efficient quantity from part (c).

(e)	  (6  points)  If  the  government  subsidized  Intel  s  for  every  unit  of  computer  chips 
produced,  what  quantity  would  Intel  choose?  Find  the  choice  of  subsidy  that 
maximizes  total  surplus,  i.e.,  induces  Intel  to  produce  the  efficient  quantity  from 
part (c). 

(f)	  (3  points)  Both  the  price  regulation  policy  from  part  (d)  and  the  subsidy  policy 
from  part  (e)  maximize  total  surplus.  Is  there  any  reason  someone  might  prefer 
one policy over the other?

4.  (25  points)  Firm  1  and  firm  2  are  the  only  producers  of  spring  water  in  the  market. 
The market demand  for spring water  is given by P = 70 − Q1  − Q2 . Firm 1 and  firm 2 
compete by choosing quantities Q1 and Q2  respectively. Each  firm has a marginal cost 
of 10 and no fixed cost. 

(a)  (5 points) Find out firm 1’s and firm 2’s reaction functions.  

(b)  (5  points)  Suppose  the  two  firms  choose  quantities  simultaneously. What  are  the 
equilibrium price, quantities, and profits of the two firms in this market?

(c)  (5  points)  Suppose  only  firm  1  has  a  chance  to  bribe  the  government  and  get  the 
right to choose the quantity first, what is the maximum amount of money that firm 
1 is willing to pay? If firm 1 gets to move first, what are the equilibrium quantities 
and  profits  of  firm  1  and  firm  2?  [Hint:  if  firm  1  does  not  bribe  the  government, 
the two firms will choose quantities simultaneously as in (b).] 

(d)  (5  points)  Now  back  to  the  situation  that  the  two  firms  choose  quantities 
simultaneously.  Suppose  the  two  firms  decide  to  collude  and  share  the  profit 
equally. Assume  that  both  firms  value  their  reputation  and will  behave  according 
to  their  agreement. What  are  the  quantities  they will  choose  for  each  firm? What 
is the profit of each firm?

(e)  (5  points)  Suppose  the  two  firms  decide  to  collude  and  share  the  profit  equally, 
but  both  firms  do  not  care  about  their  reputation  and might  try  to  take  advantage 
of  the other. Foreseeing  this,  they make a  legally  enforceable  contract  saying  that 
if  a  firm  does  not  produce  the  quantity  agreed,  it  has  to  pay  some  penalty  to  the 
other  firm.  What  is  the  minimum  amount  of  penalty  that  ensures  each  firm 
producing the right quantity agreed in part (d).

5.  	 (19 points) The country of Economia has  two  industries.  In  the Clothing  industry,  the 
marginal  product  of  labor  is  always  1.  In  the  Steel  industry,  the marginal  product  of 
labor  is12L− 
1 /  2   − 2 ,  where  LS  is  the  total  number  of  workers  employed  in  the  Steel 
S 
sector. The  total supply of  labor  in Economia  is  fixed at  LC  + LS  = 25 , and  the output 
price is 1 for both Clothing and Steel. 

(a)  (7  points)  Suppose  that  the  labor market  is  competitive. How many workers will 
be  employed  in  the  Clothing  sector,  and  how  many  in  the  Steel  sector?  What 
wage  rate will workers  in  each  sector  receive?  [Hint: Workers  can  switch  sectors 
at will. What does that imply about wages in the two sectors?]

(b)  (8 points) Suppose that workers in the Steel sector form a union, which acts as a 
monopolist in supplying labor to the Steel industry. The union chooses a level of 
employment that maximizes the total wages of its members (i.e., it maximizes 
wSLS). How many workers will the union allow to be employed in the Steel 
sector? How many will now be employed in the Clothing sector? What wage rate 
will workers in each sector receive? [You should assume that the prices of 
Clothing and Steel remain 1.]

(c)  (4  points)  If  workers  in  Clothing  had  unionized  in  order  to  increase  their  wage 
rate  instead  of  workers  in  Steel,  what  would  have  happened  to  employment  and 
wages  in  each  sector? Explain why.  [No  calculations necessary;  just describe  the 
outcome qualitatively.]
