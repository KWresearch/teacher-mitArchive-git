00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,940
PROFESSOR: I was an
undergrad at MIT.

3
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,400
And I majored in both economics
and management.

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,060
And while I was taking classes
in these subjects, I also had

5
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,300
the chance to tutor and teach
the subjects for a couple of

6
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,400
semesters over a couple
of years.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,450
And while I was tutoring and
teaching the subject, what I

8
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,070
noticed is that there were a
number of problems that would

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,850
always trip up students in
certain and specific ways.

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,600
And so what I'm hoping to do
in these problem-solving

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,200
videos is I'm hoping to take
some of the more difficult

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,600
problems from the PSETS, and
take you through the

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,790
solutions, so that these
problems that come up won't

14
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,170
affect you.

15
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,480
And what we're going to do is
I want you to not just take

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,870
away a quantitative solution
to the problem.

17
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,020
But more specifically, I want
you to be able to take that

18
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,430
quantitative solution, link it
to a conceptual understanding

19
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,710
through figures and diagrams,
and ultimately build a greater

20
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,960
intuition about economics
principles in general.

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,200
I hope you enjoy the videos,
and I look forward to

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,450
working with you.
