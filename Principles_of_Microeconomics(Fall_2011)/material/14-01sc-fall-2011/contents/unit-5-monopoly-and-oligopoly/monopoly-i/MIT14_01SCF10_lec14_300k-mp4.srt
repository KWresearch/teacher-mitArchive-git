JON GRUBER: All right, so today
we are going to continue

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,730
with our discussion of
producer theory.

12
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,310
And today we're going to move
beyond the unrealistic case of

13
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,460
perfect competition to the
somewhat more realistic case

14
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,570
of monopoly.

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,310
Now, we've been discussing
perfect competition thus far

16
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,590
as a form of market
organization, and that makes

17
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,010
sense in some context like fast
food and other things.

18
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,910
But in most contexts, we think
perfect composition is not the

19
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,480
way the world works.

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,080
There's some limits
on competition.

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,180
And we think that markets--

22
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,240
many markets, many of the goods
we consume have only a

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:05,450
few firms. Operating systems or
cars or a lot of things we

24
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,645
consume, typically have only
a few firms in them.

25
00:01:09,645 --> 00:01:14,260
So the most realistic model of
markets would be one which

26
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,180
accounts for the fact that
there's less than an infinite

27
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,210
number of firms, there's
only a few firms.

28
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,530
That turns out also to
be the hardest model.

29
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,090
So what we do is we sort
of iterate there.

30
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,590
We started with one extreme,
which is a competitive market

31
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,890
where there's an infinite number
of firms, that allows

32
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,750
us to draw some interesting
conclusions.

33
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,540
Now we're going to reverse field
and talk about the other

34
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,962
extreme, monopoly, which
is only one firm.

35
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,080
We'll talk about monopoly
markets with only one firm.

36
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,020
Then we'll talk about oligopoly,
that middle case,

37
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,950
which is multiple firms.

38
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,230
So let's talk about monopoly,
a market where

39
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,480
there's only one firm.

40
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,180

41
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,300
The key thing to remember for
monopolies is they're no

42
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,080
longer price takers, they're
now price makers.

43
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,680
Competitive firms are
price takers.

44
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,730
They were given a price
by the market and

45
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,795
they reacted to that.

46
00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:04,790
And as we saw in the long run,
that price settled at the

47
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,440
minimum of average cost. So
basically, they were given the

48
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,320
price which dictated production
efficiency.

49
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,130
They reacted to that in how
much they produced.

50
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,970
You got a flat long
run supply curve.

51
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,795

52
00:02:16,795 --> 00:02:19,480
However, in a monopoly market,
we don't meet the conditions

53
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,660
for perfect competition.

54
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,120
In particular, one condition was
that consumers had perfect

55
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,850
substitutes between your
good and other

56
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,010
goods they could buy.

57
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,530
That's not true in a
monopoly market.

58
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:36,850
So if we think about that era,
sort of maybe, I don't know, I

59
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,340
don't have my computer history
isn't as good.

60
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,420
Maybe 10 years ago when Macs
were sort of at the nadir of

61
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,580
their popularity.

62
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,670
And really you had to be a
pretty high tech guy to be

63
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,390
using Linux and things
like that.

64
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,150
That Windows had virtually a
monopoly on operating systems.

65
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,700
Not really, but virtually.

66
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,460
Certainly unless you were a
high tech guy who could do

67
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,880
Linux and things like that,
pretty much if you wanted an

68
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,090
operating system,
you got Windows.

69
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,440
Windows pretty much
had a monopoly.

70
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,420
And that's may be as close as
we've come in the modern

71
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,680
economy to thinking about
an example of monopoly.

72
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,540
In that case, Bill Gates
had to decide--

73
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,210
wasn't given a price, he had to
decide how much to charge

74
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,450
for Windows.

75
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,320
And that decision determined
in turn how

76
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,200
much he would produce.

77
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,990
And that's exactly what we'll
talk about today, is how does

78
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,930
a monopolist decide both what
to charge and how much to

79
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,990
produce of their good?

80
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,820
So to do that, we're going
to turn to a new concept.

81
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,340
Well, not a new concept, but a
different way of looking at

82
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,450
something we've talked
about before,

83
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,700
which is marginal revenue.

84
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,680

85
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,640
If you remember, the profit
maximizing condition that we

86
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,470
derived when we started our
competition lectures was that

87
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,430
marginal revenue equals marginal
cost. That was our

88
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,630
profit maximizing condition,
was that marginal revenue

89
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,670
equals marginal cost.

90
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,640
Now we're going go to--

91
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,050
in perfect competition.

92
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,810

93
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,340
And the way we thought about
this marginal revenue equals

94
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,290
marginal cost, remember the
logic was this notion of

95
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,090
climbing this profit hill.

96
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,780
You want to produce any unit.

97
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,290
Think of yourself as climbing
this profit hill.

98
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,709
You're deciding, do I produce
the next unit?

99
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,920
And I produce the next unit as
long as the money I make off

100
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,630
that unit exceeds what it cost
to produce that unit.

101
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,990
So I climb that profit hill.

102
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,010
If marginal revenue is greater
than marginal cost,

103
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,280
I keep going up.

104
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,060
At the peak, marginal revenue
will equal marginal cost. Once

105
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,420
I go beyond that peak, marginal
revenue will fall

106
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,030
down below marginal cost and
I'll stop producing.

107
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,090
So the notion is I climb this
hill, which in the peak is

108
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,430
dictated by marginal revenue
equals marginal cost.

109
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,600
Now for a competitive firm,
we said marginal

110
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,630
revenue was just price.

111
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,670
So in perfect competition, the
rule was set price equal to

112
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:55,090
marginal cost. But that
was a particular

113
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,440
case of marginal revenue.

114
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,460
So for example, to see that,
let's look at Figure 14-1.

115
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,475
This is another way.

116
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:04,125
Probably next year when I teach
this, I'll put this in

117
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,660
the lecture on competition.

118
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,750
Just a way to think about how
marginal revenue is priced.

119
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,160
Remember, a perfectly
competitive firm faces a

120
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,720
perfectly elastic
demand curve.

121
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,160
They face a perfectly elastic
demand curve.

122
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:24,360
So they have to think about what
the implications are of

123
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,850
the marginal unit they sell.

124
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,720
Well if they sell little q
units, their revenue's a.

125
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,390
If they sell one more unit,
their revenue is b.

126
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,950
And the marginal revenue is the
height of that rectangle B

127
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,650
times the base.

128
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,740
The base is 1 because it
goes from q plus 1.

129
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,390
The height is p.

130
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,240
So the marginal revenue
is price.

131
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,800
This is a pretty
basic diagram.

132
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,620
So marginal revenue
is price for the

133
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,430
perfectly competitive firm.

134
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,270
Now let's look at the
monopoly case.

135
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,320
The difference with a
monopolist, as you see in

136
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,900
Figure 14-2, is they no longer
face a perfectly elastic

137
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,080
demand curve.

138
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,840
They now face a downward-sloping
demand curve.

139
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,870
Why is that?

140
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,150
Well remember, this is the
graph for little q.

141
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,690
The reason the graph for little
q was perfectly elastic

142
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,430
with a perfectly competitive
case was not that we said the

143
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,080
demand for the entire good
was perfectly elastic.

144
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,070
It's just that the residual
demand facing anyway one firm

145
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,050
was perfectly elastic.

146
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,870
Well now, a monopolist is the
only firm in the market.

147
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,500
So their residual demand
equals total demand.

148
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,756
Their residual demand
equals total demand.

149
00:06:34,756 --> 00:06:37,030
So as long as total demand is
downward-sloping, as we

150
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,080
typically think it is,
then they'll face a

151
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,120
downward-sloping demand curve.

152
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,650
So unlike a perfectly
competitive firm, which faces

153
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,080
a perfectly elastic residual
demand curve, a monopoly firm

154
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,900
will face a downward-sloping
market demand curve.

155
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,632
They face the entire market
demand curve.

156
00:06:52,632 --> 00:06:53,910
So this is demand curve.

157
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,330
Now we're talking about big Q's
not little q's anymore.

158
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,110
Or we could say little
q equals big Q.

159
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,430
There's only one firm.

160
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,290
So little q's and the big
Q's are the same.

161
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,370
So now the firm reacts not to
its residual firm demand

162
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,330
curve, which is flat, but
the downward-sloping

163
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,050
market demand curve.

164
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,170
Now, we're going to make
one assumption

165
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:11,990
here that's very important.

166
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,080
We'll come back to this at
the end of the lecture.

167
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,540
We're going to assume that the
monopolist can only charge one

168
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,310
price for their good
to all consumers.

169
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,500
So most of this lecture we're
going to assume a non-price

170
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,775
discriminating monopolist. We're
going to say that Bill

171
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:28,980
Gates can't look at you and say,
look, you look like you

172
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,700
really want Windows.

173
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,460
I'm going to charge
you more than her.

174
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,180
He can't do that.

175
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,910
He has one price.

176
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,450
He sells it to the stores
at one price.

177
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,830
So it's a non-price
discriminating monopolist

178
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,520
we're going to work with for the
first 2/3 of this lecture.

179
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,910
That monopolist has
to set one price.

180
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,310
Now, for that monopolist, for
Bill Gates with Windows circa

181
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:53,900
10 years ago, let's think about
his decision to produce

182
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,260
another unit.

183
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:00,660
He's originally producing at
Q, big Q at a price p1.

184
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,010
He's originally producing
a big Q at a price p1.

185
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:07,090
If he wants to sell one more
unit, he's going to have to

186
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,400
lower the price.

187
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,350
Because he now faces a
downward-sloping demand curve.

188
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,640
So if he wants to sell one more
unit, he's going to have

189
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,070
to lower the price to P2.

190
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,350

191
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,240
I have a big cockatoo at home.

192
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,180
This is his feather.

193
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,580
So he's going to have to
lower the price to P2.

194
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,750
What's that going to do?

195
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,120
Well, on the one hand, what
that's going to do is that's

196
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,270
going to mean on that next unit
he's going to make p2.

197
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,850
So he's going to get the
rectangle B. On the other

198
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:43,400
hand, on all the units he was
selling at p1, he now gets a

199
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,000
lower price p2.

200
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,080
So he loses the rectangle C.
So the marginal revenue for

201
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:57,490
this monopolist, the marginal
revenue is equal to the

202
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:05,360
rectangle B minus the rectangle
C. The marginal

203
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,020
revenue is rectangle B
minus rectangle C.

204
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,640
Or alternatively, you could say
that if we just write that

205
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:18,590
out, write out what that
is, that's p2 minus p1

206
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,670
minus p2 times Q1.

207
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:27,790

208
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:33,550
Or rewriting, we could rewrite
this then as marginal revenue

209
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:42,260
equals p plus delta p delta q,
how much the price changes

210
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,640
when you change the quantity,
times the

211
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,010
original quantity Q1.

212
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:49,810

213
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,780
Or one more time, for those of
you who prefer calculus.

214
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:59,950
If revenue equals p times q, and
q is a function of p, then

215
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:04,770
marginal revenue,
differentiating that, is p

216
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:13,300
plus dp dq times Q. So marginal
revenue is the price

217
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,440
plus the change in price from
selling another unit times the

218
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,690
initial quantity.

219
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,940

220
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,860
Once again, the graphics
are in this graph.

221
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,550
The math is here.

222
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,213
We just differentiate the
revenue equation.

223
00:10:27,213 --> 00:10:30,320

224
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,210
This term is positive.

225
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,450
Price is always greater
than 0.

226
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,150
But this term is negative
because demand

227
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,370
curves slope down.

228
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,920
So there's now two effects.

229
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,750
There's a positive effect, which
is if I sell another

230
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,700
unit, I make money on
that other unit.

231
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,200
There's a negative effect, which
is to sell that other

232
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,790
unit, I have to lower the
price because I face

233
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,170
downward-sloping demand.

234
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,970
So there's two effects a
monopolist as he thinks about

235
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,790
wanting to sell another unit.

236
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,700
There's the money from that
unit, but the lower

237
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,260
willingness to pay for
all previous units.

238
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,790
And that's what makes a
monopolist a little more

239
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,210
interesting.

240
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,040
We basically think of the
monopolist as basically having

241
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,520
to work down the demand curve.

242
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,230
With a perfectly competitive
firm, they don't have to work

243
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:17,730
down the demand curve.

244
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,120
The demand's flat to them.

245
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,040
They can sell as much as they
want at that price because

246
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,350
they don't affect the price.

247
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,970
They want to sell 10 of that
price or a million at that

248
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,090
price, it doesn't matter.

249
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,280
Their demand curve's flat.

250
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,050
Not true for the monopolist.

251
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,890
If the monopolist wants to sell
more, he has to face the

252
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,780
wrath of the market.

253
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,832
And the wrath of the market is
such that if he wants to sell

254
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:36,370
more, he's going to have to
lower the price to do so.

255
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,990

256
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,940
Remember, once again assuming
he has to charge the same

257
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,520
price to everyone.

258
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,355
Assuming he's going to charge
the same price to everyone, if

259
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:45,695
he wants to sell more, he's
going to have to lower the

260
00:11:45,695 --> 00:11:46,945
price to do so.

261
00:11:46,945 --> 00:11:49,340

262
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,220
There's different ways
of [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

263
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,890
intuition on this.

264
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,100
I like to call this the
poisoning effect.

265
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,620
That's how I like to
think about it.

266
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,470
That basically, if I want to
sell another unit, I'm going

267
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,820
to poison the money I made
on all previous units.

268
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,020
Because if I want to sell
another unit, I have

269
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,220
to lower the price.

270
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,760
That's going to take away from
the money I was making on my

271
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,380
previous units.

272
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,990
So it's sort of a poisoning
effect is how I like

273
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:09,630
to think about it.

274
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:13,260
But you can have your own
intuition for it.

275
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,470
And basicallly, this poisoning
effect did not exist for the

276
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,610
perfectly competitive firm
because they couldn't affect

277
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,000
the price with their action.

278
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,030
They could sell however many
units they wanted at that flat

279
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,130
price and their actions did
not affect that price.

280
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,270
The poisoning effect only
exists with monopolists

281
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,880
because to sell that next
unit, they have

282
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,130
to lower the price.

283
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,670

284
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,890
Now, basically what that means
is to find equilibrium for a

285
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,640
monopolist, it's going to be
a little bit trickier.

286
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,380
And so let's go to Figure
14-3 and slowly walk

287
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,120
through Figure 14-3.

288
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,230
And we'll start walking
through.

289
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:52,770
What the monopolist is going
to want to do is draw a

290
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,810
marginal revenue curve.

291
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,160
With the perfectly competitive
firm, marginal revenue curve

292
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,590
was just a price, it
was given to them.

293
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,420
There was no marginal
revenue curve.

294
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,280
For a monopolist, there is
a marginal revenue curve.

295
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,155
So here I have a demand curve.

296
00:13:05,155 --> 00:13:07,160
The demand curve I've drawn
here in this example.

297
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,880

298
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,410
The demand curve I've drawn here
is q equals 24 minus p.

299
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,310
That's a typical demand curve,
downward-sloping.

300
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,250
As the price goes up, people
want less of it.

301
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,610
And now we're in
market demands.

302
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,520
Because remember, little
q equals pq.

303
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,160
There's only one firm
in the market.

304
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,870
Now, here's the trick with
monopoly: mathematics.

305
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,150
The first thing you're going to
want to do is you're going

306
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,780
to want to invert this.

307
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,330
You're going to want say, OK,
that takes q, but what takes

308
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,490
the price a monopolist
is going to charge?

309
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,560
The price a monopolist is going
to charge is therefore

310
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,850
going to be 24 minus q.

311
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,500
That's going to be the
price that the

312
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,750
monopolist is going to charge.

313
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,960

314
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:58,370
Therefore, revenues, pq,
is 24q minus q squared.

315
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,880
So we inverted the
demand equation.

316
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,160
We do this because we want to
write down a revenue equation.

317
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,050
So that's the trick.

318
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,970
This is the mathematical trick
here is to invert this, so

319
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,870
then you can write down
a revenue equation.

320
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,780
We then differentiate this
revenue equation to get that

321
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,430
marginal revenues equals
24 minus 2q.

322
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,080
That's marginal revenues.

323
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,940
The next unit you sell, you
make 24 minus 2 times the

324
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,190
amount you're now selling.

325
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,360

326
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:32,890
And that's the marginal revenue
curve graphed here.

327
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,990
Now, basically what you see is
in this case the marginal

328
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,450
revenue curve starts at the same
point as the demand curve

329
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,840
on the y-axis and
lies everywhere

330
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,150
below the demand curve.

331
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,060
Now that first fact, that it
starts at the same intercept,

332
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,870
is not always true.

333
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,940
That is true because in this
case we assumed a linear

334
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,510
demand curve.

335
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,180
With a nonlinear demand curve,
marginal revenue curves can

336
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,550
start at different points
on the y-axis.

337
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,810
The second point about the
marginal revenue curve always

338
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,700
being below the demand curve is
always true regardless of

339
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,590
the function.

340
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,840
The marginal revenue is
always below demand.

341
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,380
Marginal revenue is always
below demand.

342
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,350
So that marginal revenue curve
will always be below the

343
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,660
demand curve because of
this poisoning effect.

344
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,450

345
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,030
Now, what I want to highlight
here is this means there's a

346
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:24,410
very important relationship
between marginal revenue and

347
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,170
the elasticity of demand.

348
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,860
So let's take our marginal
revenue equation and put it

349
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:41,530
back in change terms. p plus
delta p over delta q times Q.

350
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:45,250
And let's multiply
and divide by p.

351
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:52,620
So marginal revenue you can
rewrite as p plus p times

352
00:15:52,620 --> 00:16:01,240
delta p over delta
q times Q over p.

353
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,350
So I just took this second term,
multiplied and divided

354
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,540
by p, the second term.

355
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,230
I just multiplied and
divided by p.

356
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,060
The reason I did that is because
that means you can

357
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,400
rewrite this.

358
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,245
This now starts to look like
an elasticity expression.

359
00:16:15,245 --> 00:16:17,820
Remember the expression
for elasticity.

360
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,420
This looks like the inverse of
an elasticity expression.

361
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,690
Remember what elasticity of
demand was, delta q delta p

362
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,400
times p over Q. So that's
the inverse to

363
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,950
the elasticity demand.

364
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,620
So we can rewrite this as
marginal revenue equals p

365
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,720
times 1 plus 1 over the
elasticity of demand.

366
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,800
Marginal revenue equals p
times 1 plus 1 over the

367
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,870
elasticity of demand.

368
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,520
Think about what this
means for a second.

369
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,070
What is the marginal
revenue in a

370
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,460
perfectly competitive firm?

371
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,430
Well, as a perfectly competitive
firm, what's the

372
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,670
elasticity of demand facing a
perfectly competitive firm?

373
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,110
Infinity.

374
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,210
Perfectly elastic.

375
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,061
So marginal revenue by
L'Hopital's rule equals p.

376
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:04,740

377
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,849
So for a perfectly competitive
firm where elasticity is

378
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:11,470
infinity, marginal
revenue equals p.

379
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:16,900
Now instead, if we took a firm
where the elasticity of demand

380
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,250
was minus 1, the electricity
demand was minus 1, the

381
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,950
marginal revenue would be 0.

382
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,589
Why is that?

383
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,550
What that says is, if you're
a monopolist facing an

384
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,820
elasticity of demand of minus
1, then you make no money by

385
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,420
selling the next unit.

386
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,020
Because these two effects
exactly cancel.

387
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,790
It turns out with elasticity of
demand of negative 1, these

388
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,110
two effects exactly cancel.

389
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,010
Exactly what you make by selling
one more unit is

390
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,170
offset by how much you have to
lower the price on all your

391
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,090
previous units.

392
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,430
So an elasticity of demand
of minus 1, marginal

393
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,650
revenue equals 0.

394
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,820
And as you can see as the
elasticity of demand gets

395
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,820
below minus 1, as it approaches
0 from below.

396
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,500
As the elasticity of demand
approaches 0 from below--

397
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,130
OK, I should have said perfect
competition, I'm sorry, was

398
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,500
negative infinity,
not infinity.

399
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,990
Negative infinity.

400
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:09,300
As the elasticity of demand
approaches 0 from below, then

401
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,100
you're going to see that
the marginal revenue--

402
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,830
as you approach 0 from below,
marginal revenue is going to

403
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,800
become negative.

404
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,270
So for example, if the
elasticity of demand equals

405
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:23,090
minus 0.5, then the marginal
revenue equals minus p.

406
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,700
So if this is minus 0.5, then
this becomes minus 2.

407
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,240
So marginal revenue
equals minus p.

408
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,260
You lose money.

409
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,270
So as that elasticity of demand
approaches 0, you're

410
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,740
going to have a negative
marginal revenue from selling

411
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,310
the next unit.

412
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,280
And why is that?

413
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,370
With a very inelastic good,
you have to push the price

414
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,940
down so much to sell the next
unit that you lose money.

415
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,850
Think about a very elastic
versus very inelastic good.

416
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,580
With a very elastically demanded
good, to sell another

417
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,710
unit you don't have to change
the price much.

418
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,580
Because the demand curve's
very flat.

419
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,440
So there's not much of
a poisoning effect.

420
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,490
dp dq is small, or
dq dp is big.

421
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,810
OK, this is the inverse.

422
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:14,560
So dq dp is big with elasticity,
so dp dq is small.

423
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,290
With a very inelastically
demanded good, to sell one

424
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,680
more unit you're going to lower
the price a ton, which

425
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,570
is going to poison the revenues
you get from selling

426
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,820
that extra unit.

427
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:35,840
So that's why marginal revenue
will be higher, or will be a

428
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,330
larger fraction of p
as this elasticity

429
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,580
becomes more negative.

430
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,630

431
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,902
Yeah.

432
00:19:45,902 --> 00:19:46,388
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

433
00:19:46,388 --> 00:19:50,762
elastic that means
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

434
00:19:50,762 --> 00:19:52,220
irrespective of the price.

435
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,622
So couldn't you just charge a
higher price and get marginal

436
00:19:55,622 --> 00:19:57,580
revenue [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

437
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,910
JON GRUBER: No, because
here's the thing.

438
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,460
You should have already been
charging that high price.

439
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,030
The point this is the margin.

440
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,920
So you go into a market
for insulin.

441
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,552
You say, look, these guys are
going to die without it.

442
00:20:07,552 --> 00:20:11,120
I'm going to charge
$500,000 a shot.

443
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,090
But now the question we're
asking about marginal revenue.

444
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,600
And at $500,000, you sell to
everyone who can afford it and

445
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,100
everyone else dies.

446
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,270
Now you want to ask, what's the
marginal revenue as you're

447
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,720
trying to sell that 500,000
and first unit?

448
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,560
Well to sell that, since it's
inelastically demanded, if

449
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,690
that person could afford
anything like $500,000, they

450
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,320
would have bought it already.

451
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:33,960
They can't.

452
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,450
They can only afford $400,000.

453
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,280
We have to lower the
price to $400,000.

454
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,720
You're going to sell one more
unit at $400,000 but lose

455
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,090
$500,000 on all those other
units you were going to sell

456
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,710
at $500,000.

457
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,870
The point is it's about the
margin not the level.

458
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,010
Yes, monopolists make a huge
profit when it's inelastic.

459
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,160
I'll talk about that
in a minute.

460
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,630
But that next unit they're
going to lose money on.

461
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:59,180

462
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,190
So that's actually a good point
to segue to now, let's

463
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,880
talk about with this in place,
let's talk about how

464
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,310
monopolists maximize profits.

465
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,970
Let's talk about monopoly
profit maximization.

466
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:16,960
Let's go to Figure 14-4.

467
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,630
Profit Maximization
for a Monopolist.

468
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,510
Now, this is a lot more
confusing than perfectly

469
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,310
competitive firms, so let's
follow along here.

470
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,950

471
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,300
This is a case the cost
function here

472
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,760
is 12 plus q squared.

473
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,200
So I'm doing the cost
function, which

474
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,440
is 12 plus q squared.

475
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,710
That's the cost function.

476
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,990
And the demand function,
as before, is Q

477
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,120
equals 24 minus p.

478
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,370
So that's what's graphed here.

479
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,800

480
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,840
Now, recall the rule that profit
is maximized where

481
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,390
marginal revenue equals marginal
cost. Well, we know

482
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,540
marginal revenue.

483
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,100
We know marginal revenue--

484
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,570
we derived that above--

485
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:01,660
is 24 minus 2Q.

486
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:07,110
What's marginal cost with
this expression?

487
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,030
Well, marginal cost,
differentiation of the cost

488
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,280
equation, which is 2Q.

489
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,350

490
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,220
So the optimization term for a
monopolist is going to where

491
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,300
marginal revenue, which is 24
minus 2Q, equals marginal

492
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,560
cost, which is 2Q.

493
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,190
Or Q equals 6.

494
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,460
That's going to be the optimal
production level for the

495
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,600
monopolist.

496
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:36,120
So we can see that graphically
that's where the marginal cost

497
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,400
curve hits the marginal
revenue curve.

498
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,490
If you go downward from that
point, you get that the sales

499
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,730
are 6 units.

500
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,200
So marginal revenue equals
marginal cost at 6.

501
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,740
You should be able to see that
graphically, it's just where

502
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,060
the curves intersect.

503
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,235
Mathematically I just
did it here.

504
00:22:51,235 --> 00:22:52,840
It's actually pretty
straightforward.

505
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,270
Here's the hard part.

506
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,180
What's the price?

507
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,640
We might say, well, gee,
marginal cost and marginal

508
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,590
revenue intersect at 6.

509
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,660
I'm going to draw the
dashed line over.

510
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,530
That means the price
is going to be 12.

511
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,150
Why can that not be the price?

512
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,320
Why is that wrong?

513
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,070
What would that violate
if the price was 12?

514
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,880
If you tried to sell
6 at a price of 12?

515
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,270
Yeah.

516
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

517
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,550
JON GRUBER: It's not on
the the demand curve.

518
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:19,460
The monopolist still has to
respect the demand curve.

519
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,370
So monopolists in setting
their quantity, gets the

520
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,580
intersection of marginal revenue
and marginal cost. But

521
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,740
then in setting the price, they
still have to read off

522
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,340
the demand curve.

523
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,440
They can't change
consumer tastes.

524
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,740
So they charge a price of 18.

525
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:37,010
That's where you sell
a quantity of 6.

526
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,270
So monopolists it's a little
bit trickier in a perfectly

527
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,990
competitive firm.

528
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,380
You set marginal revenue equal
marginal cost to derive Q. But

529
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,330
then to get p, you've got to go
back and plug that into the

530
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,540
demand curve.

531
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,250
So with a Q of 6, I
have my Q of 6.

532
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,410
Well, what's the p?

533
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,900
Well, to get that p, I've
got to go back and

534
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,690
plug this in here.

535
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:05,310
At Q equals 6, p is
24 minus q, or 18.

536
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,210
So I've got to respect
the demand curve.

537
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,320
The monopolist has to respect
the demand curve.

538
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,480
The monopolist picks both price
and quantity, but he has

539
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,150
to pick them such that you get
a point on the demand curve.

540
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,890
And the way we solve it, is
the monopolist chooses a

541
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,230
quantity to set marginal revenue
equal to marginal

542
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,980
cost, and then chooses the price
that's consistent with

543
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,230
demand for that quantity.

544
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:30,190

545
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,630
Questions about that?

546
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,270
Now one last thing.

547
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,950
In the short run, we still have
another condition for

548
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,740
profit maximization, which
is the shutdown rule.

549
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,340
Remember the shutdown rule
we talked about perfectly

550
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,530
competitive firms in the short
run, which is even if profits

551
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,390
are negative, you might
not shut down.

552
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,770
You only shut down if price is
less than average variable

553
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:53,450
cost. So there's still
the shutdown rule.

554
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,890

555
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:01,590
So you only shutd own if price
is less than average variable

556
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,920
cost.

557
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,840
Now in this case, what's
the monopolist profits?

558
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,430
Well, the monopolist made
a profit of 60.

559
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,660
How do we see that?

560
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:17,530
Well that's graphically the box,
the rectangle, that's the

561
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,320
difference between the average
cost curve and

562
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,420
the price they get.

563
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,130
So they're charging 18.

564
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,980
Now once again, marginal
revenue is gone.

565
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,870
Think about marginal revenue
like an imaginary concept.

566
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,610
Marginal revenue isn't something
that actually exists

567
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,390
in the market.

568
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,920
Marginal revenue is just
something the monopolist draws

569
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,420
to pick what they're
going to do.

570
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,400
But then it disappears.

571
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,920
What the monopolist cares
about then is price.

572
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:44,640
They're charging 18.

573
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,580
Their average cost for
that unit is only 8.

574
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,000
So they're making a profit of
10 per unit on 6 units.

575
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,660
So they're making
a profit of 60.

576
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,660
And what you can see, what you
should be able to demonstrate

577
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:00,040
to yourself is, if a monopolist
sold 5 units.

578
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,325
I'm sorry, selling 6 units.

579
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:04,650
If the monopoly sold that
seventh unit, what you'll be

580
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,640
able to see is they would lose
money on the seventh unit.

581
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,890
Because yes, if they sold that
seventh unit, what happened if

582
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:11,670
they sold the seventh unit?

583
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,470
Well then their price would have
to be what if they wanted

584
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:16,130
to sell a seventh unit?

585
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,520
The price would have to be 17.

586
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,080
The price would have to be 17.

587
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,970
So to sell a seventh unit,
they'd have to

588
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:30,760
have a price of 17.

589
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,040
So basically at a price of
17, the price was 17.

590
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,650
Then what would happen?

591
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,570
Well, they'd sell one
more unit at 17.

592
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,710
That'd be good.

593
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,470
But they'd lose $1
on the previous 6

594
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,760
units, which is bad.

595
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,000
So how much revenues
would they make?

596
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,550
What would be their
marginal revenue?

597
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:52,170
Well, the marginal revenue would
be they make 17 minus

598
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,020
the 6 poisoning effect.

599
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,730
So marginal revenue equals 11.

600
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,240
What's their marginal cost?

601
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,640
Their marginal cost is 2Q.

602
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,090
Marginal cost is 14.

603
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,060
So they lose money.

604
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,290
So you should be able
to walk through

605
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,770
this exercise yourself.

606
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:17,340
You might say, gee, the marginal
cost of that next

607
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,140
unit is only 14.

608
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,800
They sell it for 17.

609
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,620
Gosh, they should do it.

610
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,840
What you're missing is by
selling it for 17, they've

611
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,160
lost the dollar extra
they make on each of

612
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,610
the previous 6 units.

613
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:28,880
And that poisoning
effect makes it

614
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,630
unprofitable to do this.

615
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,700
And that's why the monopolists
stop short of what would be

616
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,790
the perfectly competitive
outcome.

617
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,580
What would the perfectly
competitive firm do?

618
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,390
The perfectly competitive
firm would set marginal

619
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,520
cost equal to demand.

620
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,370
And they would end up producing
where marginal cost

621
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,190
equals demand.

622
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:48,270
So demand here is 24 minus p.

623
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,040
Marginal cost is 2Q.

624
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:56,530
So they would end up producing
where marginal cost equals

625
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,080
demand at a much higher
level charging a

626
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,860
slightly lower price.

627
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,230
So what you see is the
monopolist ends up selling

628
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:08,490
fewer units at a higher price.

629
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,296
Questions about that?

630
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:10,230
Yeah.

631
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,755
AUDIENCE: How does this work
for Microsoft where their

632
00:28:11,755 --> 00:28:15,100
marginal costs are very
low or nonexistent?

633
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,640
JON GRUBER: Well, then what
would happen, if their

634
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,360
marginal costs were very
low or nonexistent.

635
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,990
Think of that marginal
cost curve then as

636
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,140
being much, much flatter.

637
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,860
It would intersect demand at
a much higher quantity.

638
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,110
Or it'd intersect marginal
revenue at a

639
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,820
somewhat higher quantity.

640
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,060
Not that much higher.

641
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,540
So if marginal cost is very
low, they produce more but

642
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,770
they make even more profits.

643
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,120
So it's a good question
actually, a good comparative

644
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,860
statics exercise.

645
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,520
You bring that marginal
cost curve down,

646
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,530
what's going to happen?

647
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:43,260
Quantity is going to go up, but
not as quickly as profits

648
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,390
are going to go up.

649
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,230
That's why Bill Gates is the
richest man in the world.

650
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,280
That's what happens.

651
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,540
You get really rich.

652
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,650
So basically, when you're a
monopoly, low marginal cost

653
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:53,900
you get really rich.

654
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,930

655
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,920
But that's a great thought
exercise to understand how

656
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,640
this monopoly example works.

657
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,920
Other questions about that?

658
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,770
So this is a good opportunity
to introduce an important

659
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:09,550
concept with monopolists, the
concept of market power.

660
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:14,040
What monopolists have, what Bill
Gates has that my local

661
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:18,830
McDonald's does not
is market power.

662
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:23,720
Or what he had, has less of
now, is market power.

663
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,010
Market power is the ability to
charge price above marginal

664
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:33,210
cost. The summary statistic of
how much power a monopolist

665
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:36,690
has is how much they can drive
their price above marginal

666
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,190
cost.

667
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,870
When Bill Gates marginal cost
dwindles to 0, his market

668
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,240
power gets bigger.

669
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,720
Price above marginal cost.

670
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,010
Now to think about this,
remember the condition for

671
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,540
profit maximization.

672
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:53,130
It was that marginal revenue,
which we wrote as p times 1

673
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:59,340
plus 1 over epsilon equals
marginal cost. So we can

674
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:05,430
rewrite this as marginal cost
over price equals 1 plus 1

675
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,680
over epsilon.

676
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,670

677
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,810
Now let's define the markup.

678
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:17,060
Let's define the markup as price
minus marginal cost, how

679
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,900
much money you make
on the next unit.

680
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,080
You sell for p, you get marginal
cost. It's money you

681
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,010
make the next unit.

682
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:25,700
If you define the markup, p
minus MC over p, that's the

683
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,370
percentage markup.

684
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,810
It's how much you make
on the next unit,

685
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,340
the percentage markup.

686
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:34,660
Then you can see that
that markup equals

687
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,580
minus 1 over epsilon.

688
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,000
So the markup for a monopoly
firm equals

689
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
minus 1 over epsilon.

690
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,840
This comes to the question
before about the insulin

691
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,430
example's sort of confusing.

692
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,180
Here we see your intuition
on insulin.

693
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:51,310
The lower its elasticity, the
more the monopolists can mark

694
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,170
up their price.

695
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,740
So your intuition
is shown here.

696
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,350
Yes, the monopolist
will charge an

697
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,550
incredible price for insulin.

698
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,820
They'll still lose a lot of
money if they try to raise

699
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,960
that price, if they try
to sell one more unit.

700
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,700
But the first initial price
they'll set will

701
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,170
be incredibly high.

702
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:11,850
Basically, what is the
constraint on Bill Gates?

703
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,040
What is the constraint
on Bill Gates?

704
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,640
It's Steve Jobs.

705
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,660
It's substitutes.

706
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,430
The only constraint on a
monopolist is the extent to

707
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,320
which people can sub--

708
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,980
actually, let me go back, that's
not a good example.

709
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,410
Let's [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

710
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,560
Bill Gates circa 10 years ago.

711
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,940
The constraint on Bill Gates
circa 10 years ago was a

712
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:34,650
mainframe or some other form
of doing a set of--

713
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,920
or 20 years ago it
was a typewriter.

714
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,790
It was basically the fact that
there was some other way to do

715
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:42,370
what Bill Gates was
letting you do.

716
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,680
If there was no other way to do
what Bill Gates was letting

717
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,460
you do, he would charge
an infinite price.

718
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,080
Clearly if there's
some other way--

719
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,200
and also, elasticity of course,
comes from substitutes

720
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,240
or one substitute is just
not to compute.

721
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,580
So if Bill Gates tried to charge
infinity for Windows,

722
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,500
people just wouldn't
own computers.

723
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,103
So the reason Bill Gates can't
charge infinity, and the

724
00:32:02,103 --> 00:32:04,520
reason he can't charge infinity
for insulin is that

725
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,720
there's some elasticity
of demand.

726
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,180
People at some point will
just stop buying.

727
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,980
Either because they'll choose to
use a typewriter instead or

728
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,060
they just won't compute.

729
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,140
They'll write by hand
or something.

730
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,770
So basically at some point,
there is some elasticity

731
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,550
because there's a market
demand curve.

732
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,870
And basically what's going to
determine how much market

733
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,940
power the monopolist has is
going to be how elastic it is.

734
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:27,200
Basically, how close the
substitutes are for that good.

735
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,880
If there's close substitutes,
the monopolist won't be able

736
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,510
to charge a very high markup.

737
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,900
If there's not close substitutes
as of Window circa

738
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:38,020
10 years ago, the monopolist can
charge a very high markup

739
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,910
and become very, very rich.

740
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:41,690
Yeah.

741
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,990
AUDIENCE: But if there are
substitutes for the market,

742
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:46,750
then it's not a monopoly
anymore.

743
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,190
JON GRUBER: No, no, this
is the key thing.

744
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,080
Substitutes for that producer.

745
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,140
So basically, that's why
I said Steve Jobs

746
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:53,980
is not a good example.

747
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,670
Because then it's not
a monopoly anymore.

748
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,390
But the typewriter is
a good example.

749
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,760
That's a different good, that's
a different market,

750
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,740
different good that
substitutes.

751
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:05,650
So my point is any given good,
insulin being an exception,

752
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,220
but any good there's always
something you can do instead.

753
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,410
Insulin there is something
you can do

754
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,340
instead, you can be sick.

755
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,710
There's always something
you can do instead.

756
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,200
We don't have only one
thing in life.

757
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,170
So the elasticity of demand is
never perfectly inelastic.

758
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,450

759
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,830
It seems silly 10 years ago, but
20 years ago it actually

760
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,700
was a legitimate decision
whether to have a PC or not.

761
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,770
A lot of people just didn't
have computers.

762
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:29,300
You could always just
not have one.

763
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,720
That gives you inelasticity
of demand.

764
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,465
So basically, it's important
to recognize when we talk

765
00:33:34,465 --> 00:33:36,740
about substitutes, I'm talking
about here not substitutes

766
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,790
within the market, but
substitutable activities,

767
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,970
other things you could
do with your money.

768
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,360
And the more other things are
you could do with your money,

769
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,360
the less markup that Bill Gates
can make on his Windows

770
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,110
operating system.

771
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,590
Questions about that?

772
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:58,570
OK, now we can ask, OK, gee,
John, this is all good and

773
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,186
interesting, but why did you
just waste the last lecture

774
00:34:00,186 --> 00:34:01,576
and a half teaching us about
welfare if you're just going

775
00:34:01,576 --> 00:34:03,150
to go back to producer theory?

776
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,050
Well, the reason is because
now we come to what the

777
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:06,720
welfare effects of monopoly.

778
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,480
And ask, what effects do
monopoly have on society?

779
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,170
And in fact, we can show you
that there's a deadweight loss

780
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,350
on society imposed
by monopoly.

781
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:18,659
To see that, let's go
to Figure 14-5.

782
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,900
And here we can show the
deadweight loss of monopoly.

783
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,830
And here's the same example
we were using.

784
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:29,489
Demand is Q equals 24 minus p.

785
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:31,139
Marginal cost is 2Q.

786
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,340
The cost function is
12 plus Q squared.

787
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,480
So marginal cost is 2Q.

788
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,880
As we saw before, the monopolist
chose to sell 6

789
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:43,460
units at a price of 18.

790
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:47,820
6 units at a price of 18.

791
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:54,420
The perfectly competitive firm
sets demand, which is 24 minus

792
00:34:54,420 --> 00:35:00,540
Q, sets price, I'm sorry, equal
to marginal cost. Well,

793
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,230
price comes to demand
curve as 24 minus Q.

794
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,830
Marginal cost is 2Q.

795
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:09,310
So the perfectly competitive
firm sets Q equal to 8.

796
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:13,400
The perfectly competitive
firm sets q equal to 8.

797
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,850
They choose to sell 8 units
at a price of 16.

798
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:20,680
So you get the competitive
quantity Q sub c is eight and

799
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,380
the competitive price
piece p sub c is 16.

800
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,830
That's where graphically demand
equals marginal cost.

801
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:29,960
Or price equals marginal cost.

802
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:35,320
The monopoly firm sells 6
units at a price of 18.

803
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,350
So what is the welfare
effects of monopoly?

804
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,600
What we see is we know
that the competitive

805
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,770
firm maximizes welfare.

806
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,490
We learned that last time.

807
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:47,650
We know that the best you can
do is to sell 8 units at a

808
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,180
price of 16.

809
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,780
What happens when you sell
6 units at a price of 18?

810
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:58,120
What happens is consumer surplus
falls from A plus B

811
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:07,770
plus C. So with perfect
competition, consumer surplus

812
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:14,980
is A plus B plus C. With a
monopoly, consumer surplus

813
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:21,330
falls to the area A. So you lose
B plus C with monopoly.

814
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:26,730
Producer surplus under perfect
competition was the area D

815
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:32,510
plus E. Now under a monopolist,
the producer

816
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:47,060
surplus is equal to D plus E
plus B. The monopolist , in

817
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:51,680
this case, gained the rectangle
B, but gave up the

818
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,760
rectangle E. The consumer lost
the rectangle B, that was a

819
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,180
transfer to the monopolist. So
there was a transfer of the

820
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,880
rectangle B from the consumer to
the monopolist. But C plus

821
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,260
E have disappeared.

822
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,060
They're a deadweight loss.

823
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,250
They're deadweight loss because
in the perfectly

824
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,840
competitive equilibrium these
are trades that would have

825
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,570
made both parties better off.

826
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,930
That is, these are trades which
socially should happen.

827
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:20,070
They are trades where the value
to the consumer exceeds

828
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,640
the cost of producing
that unit.

829
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,240
Those seventh and eighth
units are units--

830
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,940
so take the seventh unit.

831
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,700
What's that worth to someone?

832
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,380
Well, it's worth 17.

833
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,320
We can read that off
the demand curve.

834
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,260
That's a willingness
to pay curve.

835
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,950
People are willing to pay 17
for that seventh unit.

836
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,610
What's it cost to produce?

837
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,270
It cost 14.

838
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:44,210
So you have a unit which people
want more than it costs

839
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,180
to produce, yet it's
not getting sold.

840
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,890
That's deadweight loss.

841
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:52,190
So monopolists induce deadweight
loss because units

842
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,690
that people value above
their marginal

843
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:54,940
cost doesn't get sold.

844
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:00,500

845
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,110
Units people value above their
marginal cost don't get sold.

846
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,180
And that's because this
poisoning effect.

847
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,060
Because while it's socially
optimal to sell those units,

848
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:12,690
while society is better off,
it's privately sub-optimal.

849
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,740
From the monopolist's
perspective, it's bad to sell

850
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,620
that unit because of this
poisoning effect.

851
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,800
So basically, the monopolist
is underselling,

852
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,730
underproducing.

853
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:24,320
In general, monopolists will
underproduce goods.

854
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,560
They'll sell too few goods
because to sell the right

855
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,810
amount would not be
profit maximizing.

856
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:32,260
Because remember, what's the
profits for the perfectly

857
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,246
competitive firm?

858
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:36,060
Profits for the perfectly
competitive firm?

859
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,820
Well, we know the profits of
perfectly competitive firm.

860
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,500
We know cost if they
sell 8 units.

861
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,500
We know the cost function
is, the cost here

862
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,700
is 12 plus Q squared.

863
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:52,650
So if they sell 8 units, their
costs are 12 plus 64,

864
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:55,800
which equals 76.

865
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,620
Their revenues if they sell 8
units are 8 units times the

866
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:04,730
price of 16.

867
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:11,280
8 units time the price
of 16, which is 128.

868
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,560
So what are their profits?

869
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,770
Their profits are 52.

870
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,940
So their profits are 52.

871
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,380
The monopolist's
profits are 60.

872
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,330
So the monopolist is
better off than the

873
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,620
competitive firm would be.

874
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,330
The competitive firm would
only make profits of 52.

875
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,060
Obviously the short run.

876
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,670
The long run they
make no profits.

877
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:32,220
But in the short run they
make profits of 52.

878
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,180
The monopolist makes
profits of 60.

879
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,440
So the monopolist is better off
than the competitive firm.

880
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,220
The difference of course, is to
do so they cause a social

881
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,020
deadweight loss.

882
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,950
Questions about that?

883
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,930
Yeah.

884
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:49,870
AUDIENCE: Is that what the
OPEC is doing right now?

885
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,340
JON GRUBER: I'm going to
come to that actually.

886
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:51,780
Time out on that.

887
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,060
Because OPEC is more
of an oligopoly.

888
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,286
And we'll come to that when
we talk about that

889
00:39:54,286 --> 00:39:56,380
in a couple of lectures.

890
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,610
But I want to talk about one
more thing before we stop,

891
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,880
which is I want to talk about
the key assumption we made

892
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,130
here, which was the monopolist
could only charge

893
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,210
one price to everyone.

894
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,080
In fact, we know that's
not true.

895
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,880
In fact, we know in the world,
there's a large amount of what

896
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,730
we call price discrimination.

897
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,510
There's a large amount of
price discrimination.

898
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:20,185
We know that for many goods,
different prices get charged

899
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:21,390
to different consumers.

900
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,210
If you ever tried to book an
airline ticket the last

901
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:26,370
minute, you know exactly
what I mean.

902
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:29,570
Basically, different prices
in many, many contexts get

903
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,020
charged different consumers.

904
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,440
Everything from discounts for
senior citizens, to higher

905
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,110
price last-minute flights, to

906
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,770
specials, two for one specials.

907
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,770
People who buy two get
a special price on

908
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,410
the third, et cetera.

909
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,320
There's all sorts of price
discrimination just out there

910
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:45,870
in the world.

911
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,480
And in fact, there's very
few goods that are

912
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,760
sold at just one price.

913
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,330
McDonald's hamburger
is typically

914
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,340
sold at just one price.

915
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:56,820
They don't say like, fat people
got to pay more for

916
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,240
McDonald's hamburgers
or something.

917
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:03,190
But many, many goods we buy in
the real world are sold at

918
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,920
many prices.

919
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,580
And that's an example of a
price-discriminating firm.

920
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,810
And here's the crazy part.

921
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:10,990
Here's the crazy part.

922
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,530
It turns out that a
price-discriminating

923
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:17,220
monopolist maximizes
social welfare.

924
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,690
A price-discriminating
monopolist is as good as a

925
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,786
competitive outcome.

926
00:41:20,786 --> 00:41:22,470
How can that be?

927
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:27,210
Let's go to Figure 14-6.

928
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:28,280
Here's the price-discriminating

929
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,380
monopolist. Now, the
price-discriminating

930
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,550
monopolist, what does he do?

931
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,900
This is a perfectly
price-discriminating

932
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,300
monopolist, someone who can
charge a different price to

933
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,180
every single consumer.

934
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,440
Well, if you were a
price-discriminating

935
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,410
monopolist, perfectly
price-discriminating

936
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:46,390
monopolist and you could charge
a different price to

937
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:49,310
every consumer, what do you
charge the first consumer?

938
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:52,550

939
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,360
24.

940
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,350
What do you charge the
second consumer?

941
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,390
23.

942
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,700
Third consumer, 22.

943
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,050
You literally charge them their
willingness to pay.

944
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:04,660
If you're perfectly
price-discriminating, then

945
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,960
what you do is literally charge
every consumer exactly

946
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,210
their willingness to pay.

947
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:11,235
You say look, I know your
willingness to pay function.

948
00:42:11,235 --> 00:42:13,830

949
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:21,560
Your willingness pay function
is p is 24 minus Q. That's

950
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,120
your willingness to
pay function.

951
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,260
So I'm going to literally
charge you that.

952
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,650
I know that about you, it's
stamped on your head.

953
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,850
So I'm going to say, ah, you're
willing to pay 24 for

954
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,690
the first unit, 23 for the
second, et cetera.

955
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:39,990
In that case, what will the
perfectly price-discriminating

956
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:40,810
monopolist do?

957
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:44,140
Will they stop at 6 units?

958
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,380
No, they won't.

959
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,980
Because for that guy, there's
no poisoning effect.

960
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,970
There's no reason to
stop at 6 units.

961
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,910
That seventh unit, as we just
did the math, there's money to

962
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,490
be made on that seventh unit.

963
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:57,220
Because that seventh unit is
worth 17, but it only costs 14

964
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,460
to produce.

965
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,310
So the perfectly discriminating
monopolist will

966
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:02,460
sell it at 17.

967
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,720
Likewise the eighth unit, people
willing to pay 16 and

968
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,930
it cost 16 to produce.

969
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:08,780
So they'll sell it or not.

970
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,260
They're basically indifferent.

971
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,720
So we typically say
they'll sell it.

972
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,155
The point is, the perfectly
price-discriminating

973
00:43:15,155 --> 00:43:19,380
monopolist will work all the way
down the demand curve to

974
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,160
the competitive outcome.

975
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,810
They will move to the
competitive market outcome

976
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,560
because there's no
poisoning effect.

977
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,560
There's no reason not to.

978
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,020
No reason not to sell
as many units.

979
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,410
No reason not to climb the same
hill the competitive firm

980
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:39,930
climbs and sell any unit where
the price exceeds the marginal

981
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:41,950
cost.

982
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:45,110
Well, what's interesting is
let's ask what's happened to

983
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:47,730
social welfare with this
perfectly price-discriminating

984
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:53,260
monopolist. Well, consumer
surplus is what?

985
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,670
What's consumer surplus
with the perfectly

986
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:55,890
price-discriminating
monopolist?

987
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:56,540
Somebody raised their hand.

988
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,150
Yeah.

989
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,050
AUDIENCE: Zero.

990
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:58,380
JON GRUBER: Zero.

991
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,066
Why is it zero?

992
00:44:00,066 --> 00:44:01,726
AUDIENCE: Because they're
charged exactly

993
00:44:01,726 --> 00:44:02,560
how the value is.

994
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,070
JON GRUBER: Exactly.

995
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:05,490
Consumer surplus is defined
as willingness

996
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:06,790
to pay minus price.

997
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:08,980
But your price is set equal to
your willingness to pay.

998
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,470
So by definition, consumer
surplus is 0.

999
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:12,505
With a perfectly
price-discriminating

1000
00:44:12,505 --> 00:44:14,210
monopolist, there's no
consumer surplus.

1001
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:16,060
But what's producer surplus?

1002
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,360
Same person, what's
producer surplus?

1003
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,500
AUDIENCE: Everything else.

1004
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,340
JON GRUBER: Everything else.

1005
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:25,870
A plus B plus C plus D plus E.
There's no deadweight loss.

1006
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:30,850
You get exactly the same social
welfare as you got with

1007
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:31,810
perfect competition.

1008
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:33,760
It's just divided differently.

1009
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,600
With perfect competition,
consumers got A plus B plus C.

1010
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,840
Producers got D plus E.

1011
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,140
With a perfectly
price-discriminating

1012
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:44,220
monopolist, the monopolist
gets everything.

1013
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:48,890
But the total shaded
area is the same.

1014
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:51,970
So really fascinating because
here we have the ultimate

1015
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,570
screw on consumers.

1016
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:55,570
We think about competition
as being the

1017
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:56,940
best thing for consumers.

1018
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,380
Lots of firms selling goods at a
competitive market where you

1019
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,420
can shop and do what's
best for you.

1020
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,870
It's not surprising intuitively
that that's the

1021
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,120
best thing for society.

1022
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,410

1023
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:09,700
What's very surprising
intuitively is having a

1024
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,160
producer who can screw every
single consumer out of every

1025
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:17,680
penny they value something is
equally good for society.

1026
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,750
And why is that?

1027
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,390
That's because we've made a
particular assumption, which

1028
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,840
is social welfare is the sum
of producer surplus and

1029
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,430
consumer surplus.

1030
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:26,570
The linear sum.

1031
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:29,240
Since it's is sum, we don't care
in that function who gets

1032
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,130
the dollars.

1033
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:32,540
We just care about the total
amount of dollars, the total

1034
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,740
size of the pie.

1035
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,900
We don't care who gets what
slice of the pie, we just care

1036
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,310
about the total size
of the pie.

1037
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:40,280
And the total size of the pie
is the same with a perfectly

1038
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,680
price-discriminating
monopolist and

1039
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,030
a competitive firm.

1040
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:46,550
What this highlights is that
that's a pretty stupid way to

1041
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:49,400
think about social welfare.

1042
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,210
Clearly, we don't feel the same
way about a market where

1043
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:54,430
people get everything
they want and a

1044
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:54,910
market where people--

1045
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:57,080
all they're willing to pay is
sucked out of them by a greedy

1046
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,160
monopolist. Clearly we don't.

1047
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,550
And that's why we're going to
need to think more richly

1048
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,280
about equity and think more
richly about the division of

1049
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,170
resources in society.

1050
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:09,790
Because it turns out that you
can have equally good outcomes

1051
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:13,020
from an efficiency perspective
that are very, very different

1052
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,400
from an equity perspective.

1053
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,590
And this is the first example
we'll see of that.

1054
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:21,960
What we'll do when we get
towards the end of the course

1055
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,933
lectures, like 23, 24, lectures
like that, we're

1056
00:46:24,933 --> 00:46:26,230
going to start talking
about equity.

1057
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:28,570
And what are different rules we
can think of for dividing

1058
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:31,200
this pie that might give
us a different answer?

1059
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,790
OK, questions about that?

1060
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:36,040
All right.

1061
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:39,380

1062
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,130
OK, so anyway, we'll
stop here then.

1063
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:44,770
Let's remember that perfectly
price-discriminating

1064
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:47,440
monopolist is obviously also
a silly concept just like a

1065
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,140
perfectly competitive firm's
a silly concept.

1066
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,090
What we're going to do next
time is come back and talk

1067
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:53,670
about price discrimination in
reality and what firms do to

1068
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:55,830
try to approximate this
golden outcome.

1069
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:57,080
