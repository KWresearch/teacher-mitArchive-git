1.  True/False Questions (TOTAL: 20  points): 

In  this  section, write whether  each  statement  is True or False.  Please  fully  explain  your 
answer, using a diagram if appropriate. No credit will be given for an answer without an 
explanation. 

(a) (5 points) A risk averse individual that has to decide between two different lotteries 
will always prefer a lottery with less risk.  

False. A risk averse individuals dislike risk but not at “any price”. They will take into 
account the expected value of each lottery in their decisions.  

(b) (5 points) Steven only consumes two goods: X and Y.  If X is a Giffen good for 
Steven, then Y must be a normal good for Steven. 

True. A Giffen good is an inferior good. Since Steven only consumes two goods, they 
cannot both be inferior goods. Therefore, Y is a normal good. (Need to point out 
explicitly that Giffen goods are a special kind of inferior goods, or the negative income 
effect of  a Giffen good dominates the substitution effect. People who only say that the 
consumption of a Giffen good decreases with income without explanation lose partial 
points.) 

(c) (5 points) Ann and Bob consume clothes (C) and food (F) only. Ann’s utility function 
is U (C , F ) = a A  ln C + b A  ln F  , and Bob’s utility function is U (C , F ) = a B  ln C + bB  ln F  . 
a A , b A , a B , bB  > 0 . The price of clothes is PC  , and the price of food is  PF  . Ann and Bob 
must have the same marginal rates of substitution (MRS) of clothes for food at the 
optimal level of consumption. 

True. With utility functions in this form, we always have an interior solution, and 
 
hence Ann’s MRS and Bob’s MRS both equal the price ratio.  
 

(d) (5 points) If S and F are perfect complements you must be indifferent between these 
two bundles: 
i.  One unit of S and one unit of F 
ii.  Two units of S and one unit of F 

False. The line that goes through the kinks of the indifference curves doesn’t need to 
have slope 1. Consider a consumer that likes to consume both goods in a ratio 2:1. In 
that case the first bundle is in another indifference curve with a lower level of utility 
associated.

2. Short Answer Questions (TOTAL: 10 points): 

(a) (4 points) Mary’s demand curve for food is Q = 10 − 2P . Her price elasticity of

demand for food at price P* equals − 
. How much is P*?

⇒ 3P* = 10 − 2P * 
⇒ P* = 2 

(b) (6 points) Ann and Bob are a couple. They are the only people in the family. Bob’s 
1
inverse demand curve for shirts is P = 5 −  QB  . Ann’s inverse demand curve for shirts 
2 
is  P = 10 − 2Q A . What is their family demand function for shirts? Calculate their family 
consumption of shirts when the price is 4 and 6, respectively.  

1
Ann’s demand function is  Q A  = 5 −  P . When  5 ≤ P < 10 , only Ann buys shirts, and
2
 
when  P < 5 , both of them buy shirts. Therefore, the family demand function is

Long Questions: 

3. (15 points) Jane has utility function over her net income U ( I ) = 

I 

(a) (2 points) What are Jane’s preferences towards risk? Is she risk averse, risk neutral 
or risk loving? [Explain briefly your answer] 

We know that Jane is risk averse by the concavity of her utility function. She 
prefers an amount for sure than any lottery that has that amount as expected value 
but involves some risk.  

(b) (6 points) Jane drives to work every day and she spends a lot of money in parking 
meters. Many days the thought of cheating and not paying for parking crosses her 
mind. However she knows that there is a ¼ probability of being caught in a given 
day if she cheats, and that the cost of the ticket is $36. Her daily income is $100. 
What is the maximum amount of she will be willing to pay for one day parking? 
[Hint: by paying that amount she avoids the risk of getting a ticket!]. 

She will be indifferent between paying x for parking or facing the “cheating 
lottery” when the following equation holds: 
U(100-x) = 0.25*U(100-36)+0.75*U(100) 
√(100-x) =  0.25*√64 + 0.75*√100 
√100-x = 0.25*8 + 0.75*10 = 2 + 7.5 = 9.5 
100-x = 90.25 
x = 9.75 

(c) (2 points) Paul also faces the same dilemma every single day. But he has a utility 
function U(I)=I. His daily income is also $100. What are Paul’s preferences 
towards risk? Is he risk averse, risk neutral or risk loving? 

Paul is risk neutral since he has linear utility function over income.  

(d) (5 points) If the price of one day parking is 9.25, will Paul cheat or pay the 
 
parking meter? Will Jane cheat or pay the parking meter under this price? 
 

Paul will cheat since: 
 
U(100-9.25) < 0.25*U(100-36) + 0.75*U(100) 
 
90.75 < 16 + 75 = 91 
Jane will not cheat since the price of one day parking is lower than what she is 
willing to pay to avoid the risk of getting caught.

4. (25 points) In Country Faraway, cigarettes are forbidden, so people trade cigarettes in a 
black market. The cigarette demand is  QD  = 12 − P , and the cigarette supply is  Qs  = 2P . 

(a) (3 points) Find the equilibrium price and quantity in the black market. 

P=4, Q=8.

 

 

 (b) (6 points) The government becomes aware of the black market and reinforces the 
police so that half of the cigarette supply would be seized and destroyed. Under 
this circumstance, what are the demand and supply functions? What is the new 
equilibrium price and quantity? Show the change by using a supply and demand 
diagram. 

QD  = 12 − P ,  QS  = P , P=6, Q=6.

 (c) (4 points) How does the consumer surplus change between (a) and (b)? 

In (a), the consumer surplus is 32, and in (b), the consumer surplus is 18. The 
consumer surplus decreases by 14. 

(d) (8 points) Suppose that the government changes the policy and legalizes cigarette 
dealings. Now cigarettes are traded in an open market. However, for every unit of 
the cigarettes bought, the buyer has to pay tax T to the government. T is equal to 
the pre-tax price P. What are the demand and supply functions under this 
circumstance? What are the equilibrium (pre-tax) price and quantity? What is the 
after-tax price paid by buyers? 

QD  = 12 − (P + T ) = 12 − 2P , QS  = 2P , P=3, Q=6. The after-tax price is 6. 

(e) (4 points) Compare (b) and (d). Which policy do consumers prefer? Which policy 
does the government prefer? Why? 

The quantities and the (after-tax) prices paid by buyers are the same in both cases. 
Therefore, consumers feel indifferent. For the government, the policy in (b) 
requires extra expenditure on police and the policy in (d) brings tax revenue. 
Therefore, the government prefers (d).

5. (29 points) Eric receives utility from days spent traveling on vacation domestically (D) 
and days spent traveling in a foreign country (F) as given by the utility U(D, F) = DF. 
The price of a day spent traveling domestically is $160 and in a foreign country $200. 
Eric’s annual budget for traveling is $8,000. 

(a)  (5 points) Find Eric’s utility maximizing choice of days traveling domestically 
and in a foreign country. Find also his utility level from consuming that bundle.  

MRS = (∂U/∂D) / (∂U/∂F) = F/D 

 PD / PF = 160/200 
 
Ö  F = 4D/5 
 
160D + 200F = 8,000 
 
Ö  D* = 25  F* = 20 
 
Ö  U(25, 20) = 500  
 

(b)  (6 points) Suppose that the price of domestic traveling increases to $250 per day. 
Calling his budget for traveling x, (suppose by now that it is unknown) find the 
demand for D and F under the new prices as a function of x.  

MRS = (∂U/∂D) / (∂U/∂F) = F/D 

 PD / PF = 250/200 
 
Ö  F = 5D/4 
 
250D + 200 F = x 
 
Ö  D* = x / 500 
 
Ö  F* = x / 400 
 

(c)  (4 points) Find the income necessary to make Eric reach the same utility level as 
before the price change. 

U(D*, F*) = [( x / 500)*( x / 400)] = 500 
⇒  x = √100,000,000  = 10,000 

(d)  (2 points) Compute the quantities demanded with the new prices and the income 
you found in section c. 

Dc* = 10,000 / 500 = 20 
 
Fc* = 10,000 / 400 = 25 
 

(e)  (2 points) Compute the quantities demanded with the new prices and the original 
income.  

D** = 8,000 / 500 = 16 
 
F** = 8,000 / 400 = 20

(f)  (5 points) Using your previous answers tell us what is the total change in quantity 
of D due to the price increase in PD that the consumer experiences and what part 
of that change is due to income or substitution effects. Give definitions of what 
income and substitution effects mean.  

Initial bundle: D* = 25  F* = 20 
 
Final bundle: D** = 16  F** = 20 
 
Compensated bundle:  Dc* = 20  Fc* =25 
 
⇒  Substitution effect 20-25 = -5 
⇒  Income effect 16 – 20 = -4 

We can decompose the change in quantity generated by a price change in two 
effects. The substitution effect is the variation in quantity generated by a change 
in the price ratio but holding utility constant. The income effect is the remaining 
change in quantity and is the result of the change in the purchasing power of the 
consumer. 

(g)  (5 points) Draw a graph showing the income and substitution effects you found.
