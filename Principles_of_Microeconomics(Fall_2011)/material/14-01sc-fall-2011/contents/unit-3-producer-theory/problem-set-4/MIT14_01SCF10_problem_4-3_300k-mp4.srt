GREG HUTKO: Welcome
back to the 14.01

11
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,250
problem-solving videos.

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,830
Today we're going to work on
Fall 2010 Problem Set 4,

13
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,640
Problem Number 3.

14
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,220
And this problem is really
going to take

15
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,490
us through two scenarios.

16
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,660
We're dealing with producer
decisions.

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,780
So now instead of dealing with
utilities, we're going to be

18
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,690
working with cost functions.

19
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,790
And we're going to
first go through

20
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,510
the short-run scenario.

21
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,790
And then we're going to talk
about the long-run scenario

22
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,440
and the implications of
both of these cases.

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,670
Problem Number 3 says, suppose
the process of producing corn

24
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:58,050
on a farm is described by the
function q equals 8k to the

25
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,230
1/3 times quantity L minus 40
raised to the 2/3, where q is

26
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,430
the number of units of corn
produced, k is the number of

27
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,920
machine hours used, and
L is the number of

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,010
person-hours of labor.

29
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,940
In addition to capital and
labor, the farmer needs to pay

30
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,690
a $15 transportation fee to
deliver corn to downtown.

31
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,300
So the cost can be written as
total cost equals 15 times the

32
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,550
quantity produced plus the
rental cost of capital plus

33
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,740
the wage rate times the
quantity of labor.

34
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,980
Part A says, suppose in the
short-run the machine hours

35
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,670
rented are fixed at k equals 8,
and its rental rate equals

36
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,220
64, and the wage
rate equals 16.

37
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,510
Derive the short-run total cost
and the average costs as

38
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:50,010
a function of output level q.

39
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,560
So to start off this problem,
we're going to start by

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,025
working with the short-run
scenario.

41
00:01:54,025 --> 00:02:00,780

42
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,110
And typically, the only
difference between the

43
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,530
short-run scenario and the
long-run scenario in economics

44
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,880
problems is that in the
short-run, the amount of

45
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,600
capital that a firm can use
is going to be fixed.

46
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,660
It means that because machines
are a fixed cost in the

47
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,230
short-run, you can't actually
change how many machines or

48
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,340
how often you use
the machines.

49
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,850
So we're going to set that equal
to 8 for this scenario.

50
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,830
And we also know that each hour
that we use this machine

51
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,510
is going to cost us 64.

52
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:37,210
And we know that for each hour
that we're using labor, it's

53
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,600
going to cost us 16.

54
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,140
We also know that in addition to
the cost of the capital and

55
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,340
the cost of the labor, which
is represented in our total

56
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,500
cost function here, for each
unit q that we produce, we

57
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,490
have to transport
it to market.

58
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,370
So we also have this 15 times
q added into our total cost

59
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,810
function, which is something
that we might not always see

60
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,100
in all of our cost functions.

61
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,150
So let's start off by solving
for the total cost function.

62
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,090
And to do this, the first thing
that we're going to do

63
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,050
is we're going to plug in to our
production function here

64
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,680
what we know the capital
is fixed at.

65
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,150
And we're going to solve for
labor, or L, in terms of q.

66
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:35,570
So plugging in for k
we're going to be

67
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,290
left with this equation.

68
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,370
And from here, we can solve
for L in terms of q.

69
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,080
And this is going to be useful
for us because what we're

70
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,930
going to do is we're going to
take this L and we're going to

71
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,400
plug it into the total cost
function, so that our cost

72
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,270
function is no longer in terms
of k and L. But it's only

73
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,750
going to be in terms of q.

74
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,060
So isolating L in this equation,
we're going to have

75
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:15,220
that L equals 40 plus q/16
raised to the 3/2.

76
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,935
So now let's go to our
total cost function.

77
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:20,399

78
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,690
We're going to plug
in for k and r.

79
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:32,180
So we know that r is
64 and k is 8.

80
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,970
We're going to plug
in for w 16.

81
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,140
And now for L we're going to
plug in what we solved for

82
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,870
using our production function.

83
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:56,720

84
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,500
So from this equation when we do
the algebraic manipulation,

85
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,620
we're going to get the total
cost function in

86
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,720
terms of only q.

87
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,750
And solving out for this, we
find that the total cost--

88
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,360
and I'm going to denote that
this is in the short-run with

89
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,520
the capital fixed by a little
sr as a subscript.

90
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:34,070
The total cost is going to be
equal to 1,152 plus 15q plus

91
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,600
16 times quantity q/16
raised to the 3/2.

92
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,880

93
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,370
Now to find the average cost,
all the average cost is it's

94
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,750
the total cost divided by q.

95
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,290
So it's per unit, how much on
average does the producer have

96
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,500
to spend to actually
produce one unit?

97
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,300
So to find the average cost,
we're going to divide this

98
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,540
whole thing through by q.

99
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:07,600
And we're going to find the
average cost in the short-run

100
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:32,460
is going to be equal to 1,152
divided by q plus 15 divided

101
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:40,370
by q/16 raised to the 1/2.

102
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,130
In part B, what we're going to
do is we're going to take the

103
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,120
total cost function, we're
going to plug in a fixed

104
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,010
quantity, and we're going to
find, what is the actual

105
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,460
amount of money that a producer
would have to pay to

106
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,010
produce a fixed quantity?

107
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,500
Part B says, suppose
the farm wants to

108
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,300
produce 64 units of corn.

109
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,330
Based on the answer to
part A, what is the

110
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,715
total short-run cost?

111
00:07:06,715 --> 00:07:09,630

112
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:16,080
So using our solution from part
A, all you have to do now

113
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:24,040
for part B is you're going to
plug in for q the number 64.

114
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:52,340
So for part B, plugging in for
q, you're going to find that

115
00:07:52,340 --> 00:08:00,670
the total cost in the
short-run is going

116
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:06,140
to be equal to 2,240.

117
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,640
Now the more interesting part
of this problem is what

118
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,520
actually happens when instead
of having to fix the capital

119
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,650
at 8, what happens when the
producer can change the amount

120
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,900
of capital that they're
producing?

121
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,610

122
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,820
Part D says, in the long-run,
the farm can change its

123
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,810
capital level by minimizing
the cost subject to the

124
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,080
production function, derive the
cost-minimizing demands

125
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,220
for k and L as a function of
output q, the wage rates w,

126
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,820
and the rental rates
of machine r.

127
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,470
So now we're going to go back
to a similar problem like we

128
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,430
saw with consumer theory where
we saw the marginal rate of

129
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,510
substitution had to be equal
to the price ratio.

130
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,480
In this case, we're going to
use something called the

131
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,690
marginal rate of technical
substitution.

132
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,340
Simply put, the marginal rate of
technical substitution asks

133
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,440
us, how many machines or how
many people would we be

134
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,350
willing to basically lay off
for one additional machine?

135
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,540
And we call that the marginal
product of capital, or how

136
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,500
much we're actually getting
from each unit of capital,

137
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,080
divided by the marginal
product of labor.

138
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,070
We're going to set that equal
to the price of the capital

139
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,620
and the price of the labor.

140
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,960
To find these marginal products
of capital and the

141
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,360
margin marginal product of
labor, what we're going to do

142
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,780
is we're going to take the
derivative of our production

143
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,510
function with respect to q, or
with respect to k, and with

144
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,560
respect to L. And when we do
that, we find that the

145
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:55,300
marginal product of capital
is going to be equal to.

146
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:06,360

147
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,810
And we can also solve for the
marginal product of labor.

148
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:26,250

149
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,170
And we're simply going to divide
here and we can find

150
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:40,490
that L minus 40 over 2k
is going to equal r/w.

151
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,290

152
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,400
And finally, the last thing
we're going to do here is

153
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,370
we're going to solve for the
amount of labor and the amount

154
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:52,620
of capital rented in terms
of the other variables.

155
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,660
We're going to plug this back
into our production function

156
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,370
that we have over here in
the middle of the board.

157
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,560
And then we can solve for how
much capital and how much

158
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,490
labor is demanded in terms
of w and in terms of r.

159
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,830
So I'll go through this process
first for solving for

160
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,350
the demand function
for capital.

161
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,820
To start off, we're going to get
this equation in terms of

162
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:33,990
L. So we have that L is equal
to 2rk over w plus 40.

163
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,090
And then we're going to take
this L and we're going to plug

164
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:40,090
it back into our production
function.

165
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:59,630
And when we do this, we're going
to have that 8k to the

166
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:06,170
1/3 times quantity 2rk over
w raised to the 2/3.

167
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,570
And now we're just going to
solve through for rk.

168
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:15,670
And when we solve through for k,
we're going to find that k

169
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:29,540
equals q/8 w over 2r
raised to the 2/3.

170
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,020
This is our conditional
demand for capital.

171
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,030
And we call it the conditional
demand because it's dependent

172
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,360
on the price that we're going
to pay for labor, the price

173
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,690
that we're going to pay for
labor, the price we're going

174
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,050
to pay for capital, and
the quantity that

175
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,160
we're going to produce.

176
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,330
Now to do this same process
only solving for the

177
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,230
conditional demand for labor,
you're going to go back to

178
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:59,040
this equation right here.

179
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,070
And instead of solving through
for L, you're going to solve

180
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,630
through for k.

181
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:23,200
And when you solve through for
k, you're going to find that k

182
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,240
equals quantity L minus
40 times w over 2r.

183
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,930
You're going to take this k,
just like we did for labor

184
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,630
you're going to plug it back
into the production function.

185
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,900
And you can solve
through for the

186
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,710
conditional demand for labor.

187
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,050
And when you do that, you're
going to find that labor is

188
00:13:44,050 --> 00:14:06,140
just going to equal q/8 times
quantity 2rw raised to

189
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,090
the 1/3 plus 40.

190
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,130
So again, to summarize this
problem, we started off with

191
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,700
the short-run scenario.

192
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,240
And what we found with the
short-run scenario, we were

193
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,870
able to plug-in for the capital
that was fixed at 8.

194
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,250
We were able to find the
total cost and the

195
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,590
average cost functions.

196
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,410
Given a fixed quantity that
they wanted to produce, we

197
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,510
solved for the total cost
in the short-run.

198
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,900
And then finally we said, let's
let the producer change

199
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,840
how much capital they
are actually using.

200
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,500
And let's figure out based on
letting the wage rate and the

201
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,660
rental rate of capital change,
let's get a conditional demand

202
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,400
that lets those variables change
that would let us then

203
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,700
solve for the amount of capital
and the amount of

204
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,690
labor that would be needed
to produce a

205
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,940
certain amount of quantity.

206
00:14:52,940 --> 00:15:00,202
