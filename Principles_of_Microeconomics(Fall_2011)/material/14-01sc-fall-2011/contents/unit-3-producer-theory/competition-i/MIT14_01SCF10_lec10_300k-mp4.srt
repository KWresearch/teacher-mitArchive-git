9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:25,260
PROFESSOR: All right.

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,900
Let's get started.

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,520
Today we are going to talk
about competition.

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,480

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,490
Just, once again, I want you
guys to try to have in mind a

14
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,450
flowchart of where the
course is all going.

15
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,800
Where does this fit in?

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,350
We talked last time about how
firms decide on the cost

17
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,200
minimizing way to produce a
given level of output through

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,530
the tangency of the isoquant and
the isocost. And we talked

19
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,600
about how if we were consumers,
we'd be done then.

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,300
Consumers just find the tangency
and indifference

21
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,000
curve in the budget constraint,
and they're done.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,950
But firms aren't done.

23
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,720
Because the level of output,
unlike the budget which is

24
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,390
given to you as a consumer,
the level of output is not

25
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,140
given to the firm.

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,670
They get to choose it.

27
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,000
So with firms, we have to
go one step further.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,790
We actually have to choose
the level of

29
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,790
output that we produce.

30
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,420
We don't just choose the way to
produce it but actually how

31
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,690
much to produce.

32
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,830
So, for consumers, it would
be sort of like consumers

33
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,900
choosing what their budget
constraint is.

34
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,730
And the way we do that is we
bring in-- since we now have a

35
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,640
third variable, which is
how much to produce--

36
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,670
we have to bring in
a third equation.

37
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,930
And that equation we bring in
is essentially the market.

38
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,090
Essentially, we say the market
imposes conditions on the firm

39
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,340
which helps them figure out
how much to produce.

40
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,950
So we take all the stuff
we did before.

41
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,770
We then take that and put
that in a market.

42
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,500
And the market interacts
with the firm.

43
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,250
And from that market
setting, the firm

44
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,680
derives how much to produce.

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,230
So, basically, the level of
production for a given firm,

46
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,760
little q, will be derived from
how firms behave in different

47
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,530
market settings.

48
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,870
And the market setting we're
going to start with today is

49
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,800
the classic starting point for
economics which is the market

50
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,075
setting of perfect
competition.

51
00:02:10,075 --> 00:02:16,274

52
00:02:16,274 --> 00:02:18,750
We're going to start talking
about perfectly competitive

53
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,510
markets, a benchmark of
perfect competition.

54
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,550
With perfect competition, this
is basically a case where many

55
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,400
firms are selling goods
to many consumers.

56
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,890
We're then going to, in the next
few lectures, talk about

57
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,790
more realistic alternatives like
monopoly which is not a

58
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,930
game but rather a market
structure.

59
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,980
It is basically a case
where one firm

60
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,180
sells to many consumers.

61
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,080
Or oligopoly, my favorite word
in all of economics, not

62
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,005
because I like the
topic so much, I

63
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:48,730
think it's a cool word.

64
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,130
This is when several firms sell
to a large market, which

65
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,120
is probably the most realistic
setting of all.

66
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,800
And we're going to come
to talk about those.

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,510
But, today, we're going to start
with our benchmark of

68
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,160
perfect competition.

69
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,410
Now, what is perfect
competition?

70
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,500

71
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,830
I can give you a technical
definition.

72
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,330
Technically, perfect competition
exists whenever

73
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:16,240
firms are price takers on both
the output and input markets.

74
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,040
They're price takers on both the
output and input markets.

75
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,080
So perfectly competitive
firms are price takers.

76
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,300
That is no action that they
take can affect either the

77
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,260
price at which they sell their
goods or the price that they

78
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,060
pay for their inputs.

79
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,150
They're price takers.

80
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,110
They're not price makers.

81
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,080
No action they take affects
either the price at which they

82
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,710
sell their good.

83
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,810
No action the individual firm
takes affects either the price

84
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,880
at which they sell their goods
or the price they pay for

85
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,130
their inputs.

86
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,570
Well, when will this be true?

87
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,430
Go back to lecture one.

88
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,280
Technically this would be true
if a firm faced perfectly

89
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:06,730
elastic demand for their
goods, and if they had

90
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:12,440
perfectly elastic supply
of inputs.

91
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,400
Under those conditions, firms
will be perfectly competitive

92
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,709
if they face perfectly elastic
demand for their goods and

93
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,399
perfectly elastic supply
of inputs.

94
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,230
OK.

95
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,810
So let's focus on the first of
those which is perfectly

96
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,710
elastic demand.

97
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,270
Let's take a look
at Figure 10-1.

98
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,160
These should be little
q's by the way.

99
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,860
This isn't a market.

100
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,930
This is a firm.

101
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,380
These should be little q's.

102
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:40,350
So, basically, what you have
here is that you have a firm

103
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,815
facing a perfectly
elastic demand.

104
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:46,080

105
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,690
What that means is the firm's
quantity is pegged by their

106
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,500
supply curve.

107
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,860
Or, in other words, the point is
the firm cannot change the

108
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:00,456
price one iota from that level
P. So, in other words, if this

109
00:05:00,456 --> 00:05:04,000
is a supply shift, say the price
of the firm's inputs go

110
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,520
up, the firm doesn't
get to charge any

111
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,680
more for their goods.

112
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,860
They just sell fewer goods.

113
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,438
So the supply shift from S1 to
S2, the firm is going to be--

114
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,080
it should be little
q1 to little q2.

115
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,540
They're going to reduce the
quantity they sell, but they

116
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,720
cannot change the price.

117
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,550
They face perfectly
elastic demand.

118
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,180

119
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,150
So when does this make sense as
a description of the world?

120
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,170
Well, it makes sense as a
description of the world under

121
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,680
four conditions.

122
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,360
So there's four conditions
under which perfect

123
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,210
competition will exist.

124
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,060
The first condition is
identical products.

125
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:49,400

126
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,135
In a perfectly competitive
market, when the firms in that

127
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:56,860
market sell identical products,
now let's be clear.

128
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,200
They don't have to literally
be identical.

129
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,860
They have to be perceived by
consumers as identical.

130
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,280
So when I say identical
products, they don't have to

131
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,100
literally be identical.

132
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,360
But consumers have to consider
them identical for purposes of

133
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,710
their demand across firms.

134
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,804
So firms have to sell identical
products for there

135
00:06:13,804 --> 00:06:14,580
to be perfect competition.

136
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,610
Because if products aren't
identical, then firms will be

137
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,790
able to charge different prices
from each other because

138
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,190
they have something
different to sell.

139
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,300
So firms need to be identical.

140
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:33,240
Second of all, consumers have
to have full information on

141
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,490
all prices.

142
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,890

143
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,880
Well, let me write down the next
two conditions, because

144
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,950
they're related.

145
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:53,255
And the third is low transaction
or shopping costs.

146
00:06:53,255 --> 00:06:56,310

147
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,200
OK, these two are critical.

148
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,630
Because the way perfect
competition is going to work,

149
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,770
its consumers are going to
shop across firms selling

150
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,300
identical goods.

151
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,195
And they're going to buy
from the cheapest one.

152
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:14,430
And if there's any failure of
either of these, the consumers

153
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,670
might not know if you're the
cheapest. And, therefore, you

154
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,230
might be able to charge extra.

155
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,035
So perfectly elastic demand,
once again we're getting to

156
00:07:23,035 --> 00:07:25,570
the microfoundation of something
we discussed in the

157
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,690
second lecture.

158
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,780
We discussed perfectly
elastic demand.

159
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,880
Now we're talking about
where that comes from.

160
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,440
What conditions do you need?

161
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,540
Perfectly elastic demand is
going to require that

162
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,480
consumers know all the prices
and can cautiously shop across

163
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,380
all the options.

164
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,410
Otherwise, firms might have
some opportunity to charge

165
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,890
different prices.

166
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,900
And finally-- and we'll come
back to why this is

167
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,150
important--

168
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:55,580
there needs to be free entry and
exit of firms. This one I

169
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,210
can't really give you
intuition for yet.

170
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,000
Just take my word for it.

171
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,450
We'll come back to why
that's important.

172
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:04,390

173
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:08,920
So, basically, what you want for
an example of a perfectly

174
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,960
competitive market, you want a
market where producers are

175
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,910
selling homogeneous goods in
an easily informed, easily

176
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,070
shocked arena.

177
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,470
So I think the best example of a
perfectly competitive market

178
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,150
is those guys selling like
shlocky touristy things around

179
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:32,850
Port Authority in New York or in
any large open air market.

180
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:37,960
Basically, in that area, these
guys all sell the same crap.

181
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,809
You can go from one to
one quite easily.

182
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,440
And it's quite easy to find
out what the prices are.

183
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,550
That's not perfectly easy, but
it's quite easy to find out

184
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,440
what the prices are.

185
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,980
That is a condition for a
perfectly competitive market.

186
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,410
It's easy to shop, because
they're all in the same area.

187
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,320
Prices are pretty easy to
observe, and the products are

188
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,880
all, basically, identical.

189
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,580
There are only so many
little Statues of

190
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,880
Liberty you can buy.

191
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,720
So, basically, that's an
example of a perfectly

192
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,820
competitive market.

193
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,530
Now, in reality, no perfectly
competitive market exists.

194
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,260
There's never been a perfectly
competitive market.

195
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,680
But this is sort of as
close as we can get.

196
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,680

197
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,250
Questions about that?

198
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,940
Now that provides a good moment
to pause and talk about

199
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,560
Peter Diamond who just won the
Nobel Prize in Economics.

200
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,915
This is my MIT economics Peter
Diamond, MIT Econ Peter

201
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:30,640
Diamond shirt.

202
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,250
Peter Diamond just won the
Nobel Prize in Economics.

203
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,610
Peter Diamond is the greatest
economic theorist of his

204
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,290
generation, sort of the heir
of the Paul Samuelson, Bob

205
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,420
Solow generation that founded
this economics department and

206
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,290
made it great.

207
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,360
Peter Diamond was sort of the
next generation that led this

208
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,320
economics department forward
and kept it great.

209
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,200
And Peter has made contributions
throughout

210
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,990
economic theory.

211
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,860
He should have won the
Nobel 10 times over.

212
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,560
What they finally gave it to
him on Monday for was for

213
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,350
search theory.

214
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,230
And search theory is essentially
about what happens

215
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,720
when markets don't work like
these vendors around Port

216
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,810
Authority in New York, when
markets aren't perfectly

217
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,730
competitive.

218
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,240
Where, basically, you have
markets where there is some

219
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,360
mismatch and some search costs
that sellers have to pay to

220
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,600
find the right buyers, and
buyers have to pay to find the

221
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,120
right sellers.

222
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,400
So the best example here, and
the example of which they

223
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,560
really gave him the Nobel Prize,
was the labor market.

224
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,630
It was about search costs
in the labor market.

225
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,590
And what Peter Diamond and his
fellow co-winners talked about

226
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,840
was about how in the
labor market,

227
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,860
your firms have vacancies.

228
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,940
They have jobs they
want to fill.

229
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,080
Individuals have labor supply.

230
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,060
They want to provide themselves
to these jobs.

231
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,040
And so there's unemployment.

232
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,820
There's people out of jobs
looking for jobs.

233
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,760
But there's vacancies.

234
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,660
There's jobs that are empty.

235
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,590
And both exist at
the same time.

236
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,120
And how can that be?

237
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,890
In a perfectly competitive
market, that couldn't be.

238
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,450
You couldn't have both jobs
looking for people and people

239
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,900
looking for jobs.

240
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,960
But what Diamond wrote down,
and these other theorists

241
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,320
developed in their models, is
basically how you get these

242
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,850
frictions in the labor market.

243
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,360
Where since these jobs have
specific characteristics

244
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,200
employers are looking for,
you can't quite match the

245
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,640
vacancies to the unemployed
workers.

246
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,300
There's a sorting process where
some are easy to match.

247
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,430
You can take the high school
dropout and put him in

248
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:12,900
McDonald's.

249
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,980
That's easy.

250
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,280
But the job which requires some
computer skills, you have

251
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,070
to find the right guy
to take that.

252
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,490
And, basically, it's these
frictions that lead to what we

253
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,240
call the natural rate of
unemployment in our economy,

254
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,920
which is the notion that no
economy would ever get down to

255
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,770
0 unemployment.

256
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,130
That's impossible.

257
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,900
And the reason is because there
will always be some

258
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,490
frictions and some mismatch.

259
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,730
There will always be some
inability of people to find

260
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,580
the right people to fill
their vacancies.

261
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,290
Now, we don't know what
the natural rate is.

262
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,650
When I was in grad school, we
learned that the rate was 7%.

263
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,950
In the 1990s, the natural rate
seemed to fall to about 4%.

264
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,550
That is we got to about a
4% unemployment rate.

265
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,300
Now who the heck knows what the
natural rate is anymore.

266
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,470
And a big debate right now among
economists in macro is

267
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,340
how much of our 9.6% is an
increase in the natural rate,

268
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,030
which is something the
government can't really fix

269
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,710
very well, versus short-term
demand reductions, which the

270
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,520
government could fix by pumping
more resources into

271
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,610
the economy.

272
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,300
And all that is informed,
theoretically, by the work

273
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,360
that Peter Diamond did.

274
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,070
Now, I hope what I just
described sounded pretty

275
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,940
obvious to you.

276
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,460
And that's good, because that's
what great theory does.

277
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,720
Great theory ex-post
sounds obvious.

278
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,440
It's just ex-ante, before Peter
Diamond did this, people

279
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,150
always said, well,
we have these

280
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,150
perfectly competitive markets.

281
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,260
This is how they should
function.

282
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,130
And he's the guy who really
taught us how real markets

283
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,370
should function like this.

284
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,350
And that's why he gets
to go to Stockholm.

285
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,450
So that's very exciting for our
economics department, very

286
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,770
exciting for the profession.

287
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:43,670
And it's just a great moment,
really, in taking economics--

288
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,540
I saw it described very
well in one article--

289
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,480

290
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,690
these last few Nobel Prizes
are the beginning of

291
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,770
recognizing that economics is
not what we teach in this

292
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,460
course anymore.

293
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,230
You need what we teach in this
course to go on in economics.

294
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,020
But probably the first couple
dozen Nobel Prizes were for

295
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,670
about what we teach
in this course.

296
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,440
And the last few have been about
what you teach in the

297
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,650
subsequent courses.

298
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,110
And that's a real evolution of
Freakonomics, to understand

299
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,630
that we need to mature as a
science and move beyond the

300
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,820
basics that you learn in
14.01 and move beyond

301
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,560
to these other things.

302
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,630
So we're giving you
the basics here.

303
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:19,140
But the excitement happens
elsewhere.

304
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,090
So it's a very exciting time for
our department and for the

305
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,560
profession as a whole.

306
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,500
Now with that little diatribe
aside, let's go back.

307
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,180
So we have these.

308
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,450
So now, having said all
that, forget it.

309
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,620
Forget Peter Diamond existed.

310
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,340
We're now going back to
perfect competition.

311
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,340
And, once again, as I said
in the first lecture--

312
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,000
and Peter would be the first guy
to say it, this is how he

313
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,620
taught me to do economic
theory-- you've got to make

314
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,940
simplifying assumptions if
you want to get anywhere.

315
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,540
So we're going to make a
simplifying assumption of

316
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,640
perfect competition.

317
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,860
We'll weaken that
as we go along.

318
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,820
But, for now, imagine it's
perfect competition.

319
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,000
And we have the situation of
perfectly competitive firms.

320
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,745
Now a very important distinction
to draw-- and

321
00:13:54,745 --> 00:13:56,410
that's why it's important to
remember that these are little

322
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,890
q's not big Q's--

323
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:04,770
is the distinction between firm
demand and market demand,

324
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,890
firm versus market.

325
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,895
And this is something
which is confusing.

326
00:14:07,895 --> 00:14:09,230
It confuses me at times.

327
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,320
I may even get it
wrong at times.

328
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,570
I'll need you to correct me.

329
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,770

330
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,850
Even if a given firm faces
perfectly elastic demand, it

331
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,740
doesn't necessarily mean
that market demand

332
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,890
is perfectly elastic.

333
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:26,350
That is the overall demand for
little, fake Statues of

334
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:32,730
Liberty around Port Authority
in New York is

335
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,300
not perfectly elastic.

336
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,910
As the price goes up, fewer
people will buy them.

337
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,490
As the prices goes down, more
people will buy them.

338
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,425
But for any given vendor
selling them, it

339
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:41,670
is perfectly elastic.

340
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,750
Because there's always
someplace next

341
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,880
door you can go.

342
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,220
So it's very important to
distinguish between the demand

343
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,530
facing the firm being perfectly
elastic and the

344
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,070
demand facing the market not
being perfectly elastic.

345
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,680
And the way to think about this
is to think about the

346
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,370
concept of residual demand.

347
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:01,370

348
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,260
We have a demand function
for market D of p.

349
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:11,460
We have a demand function for a
market which is that as the

350
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,970
price goes up demand
goes down.

351
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,000
Now the demand function for a
given firm, we'll call the

352
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,420
residual demand D super r
of p, is equal to what?

353
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:31,150
It's equal to the demand for
the market minus the supply

354
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:35,730
that all other firms in the
market provide, S super 0 of

355
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,970
p, the supply that all other
firms in the market provide.

356
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,870
So the demand for my
product as a firm

357
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,450
is my residual demand.

358
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:49,810
It's the market demand minus
what other firms supply.

359
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:54,070
Well, if you differentiate this
with respect to price,

360
00:15:54,070 --> 00:16:04,620
you'll see that dDr/dp equals
dD/dp minus dS0/dp.

361
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:13,080

362
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,190
This first one is the
market demand curve.

363
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,040
We know that's a negative
number, because demand curves

364
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,640
slope down.

365
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,440
We're not assuming
Giffen goods.

366
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,670
We know that's a negative
number.

367
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,240
But this is a positive number.

368
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,930
Supply curves slope up.

369
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,450
The amount that other firms in
the market will supply as the

370
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,080
prices goes up is positive.

371
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,520
Supply curves slope up.

372
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,330
So this is a negative number.

373
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,270
But this is a positive number
which means, by definition,

374
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,840
this is a very negative
number.

375
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,465
The firm's residual demand
responds more to price than

376
00:16:42,465 --> 00:16:44,510
the market's demand does.

377
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,580
Because the firm's residual
demand is after all the supply

378
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,830
of other firms.

379
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:52,730
So we can rewrite this in
terms of elasticities.

380
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,470
So let's assume, for a second,
that all firms are identical.

381
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,100
Assume, for one second, that
we're in a market where all

382
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,700
firms are identical, that little
q equals big Q over N.

383
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,089
Assume that all firms
are identical.

384
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:10,140
And so, therefore, the amount
produced by other firms, Q

385
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:15,609
super 0 is (n - 1) x q.

386
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:20,230
So, basically, the amount that's
produced by other firms

387
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,920
is (n - 1) x q.

388
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,099
So the last is demand facing a
given firm, epsilon sub i is n

389
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:31,280
times the elasticity of demand
for the entire market minus (n

390
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,310
- 1) times the elasticity of
supply for the market.

391
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:38,300
So, for example, let's say
you've got a market with 100

392
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,632
firms in it.

393
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:43,860
It's a big market but not
outrageously big.

394
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,180
We have plenty of markets with
more firms than that.

395
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,430
And let's say that the
elasticity of demand for this

396
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,580
market equals minus 1.

397
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,560
So it's in between elastic and
inelastic, not a crazy number.

398
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,970
And the elasticity
of supply is 1.

399
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,320
Let's just say that's
the example.

400
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,540
Then what you get is that for a
given firm, if you used this

401
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,620
formula, the elasticity of
demand facing a given

402
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,350
firm is minus 199.

403
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,910
It's a huge negative number.

404
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:19,470
So even though the market demand
is modestly elastic,

405
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,330
minus 1-- it's elastic
but not crazy--

406
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,890
the demand facing the given
firm is crazy elastic.

407
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,080

408
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,800
So, basically, the point is that
even if a market does not

409
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,270
have super elastic demand, a
given firm can face very

410
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,360
elastic demand.

411
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,610
And that's what can lead
to perfect competition.

412
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,510
It's very important to
keep those distinct.

413
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,430
When we talk about demand, think
about demand at the firm

414
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,620
level versus demand at
the market level.

415
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,590
Demand at the market level,
that's about substitutability

416
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,300
with other goods and the things
we've talked about

417
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,670
deriving demand curves.

418
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,070
When we derive demand
curves, we're not

419
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,400
deriving firm demand curves.

420
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,840
We're deriving market
demand curves.

421
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,570
And so the demand curve was a
function of elasticities and

422
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:07,150
substitutability across goods.

423
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,640
The firm demand curve is a
function of all that but also

424
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,620
how many firms are
in the market.

425
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,220
If there are a lot of firms in
the market, it's going to be

426
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,650
very elastic in a perfectly
competitive market.

427
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,250
Questions about that?

428
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,130
It's an important distinction
to keep in mind.

429
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:25,350
Now, with that as background,
let's now come to profit

430
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,580
maximization which is what
this is all about.

431
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:33,220
Remember I said we assume that
every decision consumers make

432
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,160
is driven by utility
maximization.

433
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,680
Every decision producers make
is driven by profit

434
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,970
maximization.

435
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:45,730
So let's talk about profit
maximization in the short run.

436
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,780

437
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:54,200
How do firms maximize profits
in the short run?

438
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,290
Now, the first question
we have to

439
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:00,040
ask is what is profits?

440
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,060
Well, that seems pretty
straightforward.

441
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,760
I defined those already.

442
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,440
I said, the profits were equal
to revenue minus costs.

443
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,990

444
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,740
Profits are equal to revenue
minus costs.

445
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,740
Well, the trick is that there's
two different types of

446
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,100
people who measure costs.

447
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,970
Revenue is revenue.

448
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,220
It's just, basically,
the money you make.

449
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,070
And anybody can measure that.

450
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,310
But there's two different
ways of measuring costs.

451
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:36,110
There's accounting costs, and
there's economic costs.

452
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,910
And these are different
concepts.

453
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:48,880
Accounting costs are cash flow
costs what you actually pay.

454
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,700
So your accounting costs are
what you actually pay.

455
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,790
So if you buy something for
x dollars, that's your

456
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,710
accounting costs.

457
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:04,390
The economic costs are about
opportunity costs, which is

458
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:08,090
not about what you lay out in
cash, but what you could have

459
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:11,030
done with that cash.

460
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,140
It's not just about what you
lay out, but what you could

461
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,980
have done with that cash.

462
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,370
So to give you an
example, let's

463
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,870
just do a simple example.

464
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,630
Imagine that you graduate.

465
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,330
You're going to graduate.

466
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:24,720
I don't mean that.

467
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,750
You're going to graduate.

468
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,886
Imagine that after you graduate,
you decide you're

469
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:32,620
going to start a website design
firm on the side.

470
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,530
You're going to do this while
you decide what to do with the

471
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,095
rest your life.

472
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:35,858
You're trying to figure
out where to go to

473
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:36,340
grad school or whatever.

474
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,720
You'll start a website
design firm.

475
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,490
That seems easy.

476
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:42,010
Basically, how does the website
design firm work?

477
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,120
Basically, you work full-time,
and you hire some slave

478
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,450
programmer who works for you.

479
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,480
He does all of the grunt work.

480
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,680
And let's say that you have
to pay him $40,000 a year.

481
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,510
So it's going to be you working
full-time plus some

482
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:59,050
slave programmer you're going
to pay $40,000 a year.

483
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,960
And let's say that you have
a computer that's like six

484
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,000
months old, a year old.

485
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,900
It's still in pretty
good shape.

486
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,520
It's not brand new, but it's
still in pretty good shape.

487
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,450
And you just let the slave
programmer use that.

488
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,590
So you don't have to
buy a new one.

489
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,716
So you've got the programmer,
you're paying him $40,000.

490
00:22:12,716 --> 00:22:14,900
You're letting him use
your computer.

491
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,750
You buy some new computer
you're working on.

492
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,660
So you do your work,
and he does work.

493
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,760
You put it together.

494
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,250
At the end of the year, you
tally up all the receipts

495
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,500
you've had from your
website design,

496
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,820
and you've made $60,000.

497
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,310
So you sit back and say, well,
that's pretty good.

498
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,660
I put in $40,000.

499
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,130
I paid $40,000.

500
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,360
I brought home $60,000.

501
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,690
That's $20,000 in profit.

502
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,430
That's not a bad profit.

503
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:42,800
If we think about profit
margins, we'll often think

504
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,690
about profit relative
to revenue.

505
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,800
Well that's $20,000 of profit
on $60,000 of revenue.

506
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,520
It's a 33% profit margin.

507
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,995
Most companies would
kill for that.

508
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,230
So you say, that's not bad.

509
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,740
I made a 33% profit margin.

510
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,080
But what opportunity costs did
this calculation miss?

511
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,380
So if you were an accountant,
you'd stop there.

512
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,330
That's why accountants don't
make as much as economists.

513
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,710
Because we're better.

514
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,320
If you're an accountant,
you'd stop there.

515
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,280
But if you were an economist,
what do you recognize?

516
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,690
What did this calculation
miss?

517
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,820
What opportunity costs were
involved in running this firm

518
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,840
that the cash flow calculation
didn't capture?

519
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,400
Yeah?

520
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,835
AUDIENCE: If you plot your
grunt worker and your

521
00:23:17,835 --> 00:23:20,339
computer, you might have been
able to do more work, because

522
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:21,589
the computer might be
more efficient.

523
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:24,190

524
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,230
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

525
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:25,410
OK.

526
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,590
That's sort of a different
issue.

527
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,090
That's sort of about the fact
that you might not have

528
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,090
produced as efficiently
as possible.

529
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,510
I'm not asking that question.

530
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,960
I'm asking, given the numbers I
gave you, why did I misstate

531
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,620
your economic profit?

532
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,096
Yeah, in the back.

533
00:23:39,096 --> 00:23:39,792
AUDIENCE: You could have
gotten another

534
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:41,400
job that paid more.

535
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,970
PROFESSOR: I could have gotten
another job that paid more.

536
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:43,740
Here's another thing about it.

537
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,860
I just spent an entire freaking

538
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,580
year, and I made $20,000.

539
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,910
You're hoping you do better than
that with an MIT degree.

540
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,400
At least your parents are hoping
you do better than that

541
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,260
with an MIT degree.

542
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,890
So, basically, the first source
of opportunity cost

543
00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:00,950
that this has missed is the
value of your time.

544
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,250
That doesn't show up as an
accounting cost. But it's a

545
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,200
real opportunity cost,
because you could

546
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,150
have had another job.

547
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,780
So let's say you could
have gone out and

548
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,770
made $60,000 a year.

549
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:15,940
You could have easily
found a job making

550
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,170
$60,000 as an MIT graduate.

551
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:23,330
Well, then that's a cost of
running this website.

552
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,690
By spending the year setting
this up, you forgo--

553
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:29,730

554
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,920
I don't know what the past
tense of forgo is--

555
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,350
forgoed?

556
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:36,640
$60,000 in income you
could've earned.

557
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,330
You've forgone $60,000 you
could have earned.

558
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,980
That's a real cost. It's not an
accounting cost. It didn't

559
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,350
show up on anybody's books.

560
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,650
But it's an opportunity
cost. What else?

561
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,334
Yeah.

562
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:48,886
AUDIENCE: Also the $40,000 that
you gave the program, you

563
00:24:48,886 --> 00:24:49,582
could have invested
it somewhere else.

564
00:24:49,582 --> 00:24:51,438
And it could be growing.

565
00:24:51,438 --> 00:24:53,720
PROFESSOR: You could have
invested the $40,000.

566
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,810
You gave him the $40,000.

567
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,400
You paid it.

568
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:56,750
It's gone.

569
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,600
If you put it in the bank, you
could've earned interest on

570
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,580
that money.

571
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,550
That's an opportunity cost. And
we'll come back and talk

572
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,100
about capital markets
and interest later.

573
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,630
But that's opportunity
cost. What else?

574
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,190
There's one more.

575
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,560
AUDIENCE: You could have
sold the computer.

576
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,660
PROFESSOR: I could have
sold the computer.

577
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,980
I gave it to him, and
he used it for free.

578
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,980
But if I could have sold that
for $1,000, that's an

579
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,780
opportunity cost as well.

580
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,680
So, in fact, if I could have
worked for $60,000.

581
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,520
On the $40,000, I could have
made $2,000 of interest. And I

582
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,890
could have sold the computer
for $1,000.

583
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:27,170
Then, actually, my opportunity
costs were $63,000 plus the

584
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,820
$40,000 I paid the guy.

585
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,880
So, actually, the entire cost of
the operation was $103,000.

586
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,780
So I actually lost more than
$40,000 running my little

587
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,870
website business.

588
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,070
So opportunity costs represent
the fact that you could have

589
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,820
done other things with
your resources.

590
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,450
It's not just the fact
that your cash flow

591
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,680
said positive $20,000.

592
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,330
Your economic flow said
minus $43,000.

593
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,770
Because while you're plus
$20,000, you were minus

594
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,360
$60,000 that you could
have earned.

595
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,380
Now you're down to
minus $40,000.

596
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,830
You're minus $2,000 that you
could have earned in interest

597
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,350
on the money you paid
the programmer.

598
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,740
Now you're down to
minus $42,000.

599
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,465
And you're down another minus
$1,000 you could have made by

600
00:25:59,465 --> 00:26:00,890
selling that computer.

601
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,730
So you're at minus $43,000.

602
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,190
So you actually lost money.

603
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,770
So when we talk about profit,
we want to think about

604
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,680
economic profit, not
accounting profit.

605
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,850
Now, I'm not going to make that
distinction much now.

606
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:15,230
But I want you to keep that in
mind as you go out and think

607
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,740
about starting your business or
think about whether firms

608
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,710
are profitable, remember we use
an economic concept which

609
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,640
accounts for opportunity cost,
not just an accounting concept

610
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,740
which follows the dollars.

611
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,660
Question about that?

612
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:27,940
OK.

613
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:32,090
Now, armed with this, we now
say, OK, how does a firm

614
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,660
maximize profits?

615
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,680
Well, that's easy.

616
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,450
We say that profits is a
function of quantity produced.

617
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,960
Revenues is a function of
quantity produced minus cost

618
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,420
as a function of quantity
produced.

619
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,260
Remember, what was our goal when
we laid out the start of

620
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,070
this lecture?

621
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,790
It was to figure out what
little q a firm chooses.

622
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:52,640
Well, what little q a firm
chooses is dictated by

623
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,950
maximizing this equation.

624
00:26:53,950 --> 00:27:02,140
So a firm will choose little q
such that dR/dq equals dC/dq.

625
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,550
That's the profit maximizing
equation.

626
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:08,680
A firm will choose its quantity
such that dR/dq

627
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:15,490
equals dC/dq or, to put it in
economic terms, where marginal

628
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,190
revenue equals marginal costs.

629
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:22,110
The firm will choose to produce
a quantity q where its

630
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,200
marginal revenue, which is the
revenue made from selling the

631
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,160
next unit, equals it's marginal
cost, which is the

632
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,860
cost incurred by making
the next unit.

633
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:38,100
Well, in a competitive market,
we know what dR/dq is.

634
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,360
Because remember in a
competitive market, dR/dq is

635
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,380
given to the firm
by the market.

636
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,590
In a competitive market, dR/dq,
or marginal revenue,

637
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,520
equals the price.

638
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,610
The price is given
to the firm.

639
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,600
It comes from God in the
competitive market.

640
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,820
We'll talk later about
where it comes from.

641
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,890
But, for now, let's
consider it God.

642
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,610
They're price takers.

643
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:58,410
They just get some price
handed to them.

644
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,950
So in a competitive market, we
know what marginal revenue is,

645
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,850
it is price.

646
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:05,740
So what this says is that in a
competitive market, the profit

647
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:10,190
maximizing equation is price
equals marginal cost. Memorize

648
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,800
it, put it under your pillow.

649
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,970
In a competitive market, price
equals marginal cost is the

650
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,840
profit maximizing condition.

651
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,370
You will produce until the
marginal cost of producing the

652
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,350
next unit is equal to the price
you can sell that unit

653
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,600
for in the market.

654
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,990

655
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,960
So, to see that further, let's
look at an example.

656
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:37,390
Let's go to the next figure,
Figure 10-2a.

657
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,260
For the next few examples,
I'm going to use a

658
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,070
particular cost function.

659
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:45,440
The cost function I'm going to
use to make this all concrete

660
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:54,320
is C equals 10 plus
0.5q squared.

661
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,970

662
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,470
That's the cost function
I'm going to use.

663
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:03,040
So armed with that cost
function, let's say the price

664
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,310
in the market is 6.

665
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,010
Let's say the price
in the market 6.

666
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,650
I just pulled that
out of my hat.

667
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,640
It's a market for whatever.

668
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,340
We're just doing an example.

669
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:18,340
Now, what we have on this graph,
we have a cost curve

670
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,790
and a revenue curve.

671
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,010
The cost curve literally
graphs that function.

672
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:26,290
So, in other words, if you
produce two units, then your

673
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:30,440
cost is 10 plus half
of 2 squared or 12.

674
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,060
If you produce 2 units, your
costs are 12, and so on.

675
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,570
You've got this cost curve.

676
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,190
You've also got a
revenue curve.

677
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,860
Well, the revenue curve is just
6 times the number of

678
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,360
units produced.

679
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,930
Because the price
per unit is 6.

680
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:47,150
So it's just a straight line
with a slope of 6.

681
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:51,090
So each unit you produce,
you make 6.

682
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:59,800
Now, what you'll see here is
that for this cost curve,

683
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,290
what's marginal cost?

684
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,970
Well, if we differentiate this,
we see that marginal

685
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,380
cost equals q.

686
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,880
I made this an easy example.

687
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,230
If you differentiate that,
you'll see that

688
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,130
marginal cost equals q.

689
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,780
That is just differentiate
this cost equation.

690
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,400
Marginal cost equals q.

691
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:22,520
So what that says is that the
profit maximizing point is

692
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,640
going to be to set marginal
cost equal to price.

693
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,640
So that says set
q equal with 6.

694
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,080
And you're done.

695
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,460
That's how much the firm
should produce.

696
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,300

697
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,650
The firm should produce six
units, because it's marginal

698
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,250
cost function is q.

699
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,950
It's a linear function.

700
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:44,940
The price is six.

701
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,030
That's a horizontal line.

702
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:51,920
So they only intersect in one
point where quantity equals 6.

703
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,110
Now, what you notice in this
graph is that this happens to

704
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:59,400
be the point where the gap
between the revenue curve and

705
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,280
the cost curve is largest. These
are not marginal curves.

706
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,200
This is revenue and cost. But
notice that at 6 that's

707
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,770
exactly where the revenue curve
and the cost curve have

708
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,800
the largest gap between them.

709
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,160
I think a more intuitive way
to see this is to flip to

710
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,660
Figure 10-2b.

711
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:24,030
This shows the marginal profit
that you make on

712
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,510
every unit you sell.

713
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,860
So, in other words, if you sell
fewer than 2 units, you

714
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,050
lose money.

715
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:29,690
Why?

716
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:36,040
Because if you sell 1 unit, your
costs are 10 plus 10.5.

717
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,220
If you sell 1 unit, your
costs are 10.5.

718
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,420
Your revenues are 6.

719
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,400
You lose money.

720
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,150
You lose 4.5.

721
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,320
If you sell 2 units,
you make 0.

722
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,730
Your costs are 12, your
revenues are 12.

723
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,440
You make 0.

724
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:54,120
If you sell 3 units, your
costs are 14.5, 10

725
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,130
plus half of 9.

726
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,570
Your revenues are 18.

727
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,460
So you make money.

728
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,020
So each unit, you can calculate
how much you're

729
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,620
making on that next unit.

730
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,780
On the 3rd unit,
you made money.

731
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,340
4th unit, you make
even more money.

732
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,270
5th unit, even more.

733
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:13,230
6th unit, you make the most
money you can make.

734
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:17,290
In the 6th unit, your costs
are 10 plus half of

735
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:21,240
36, or 18, so 28.

736
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,690
Your costs are 28.

737
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,390
Your revenues are 36.

738
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:27,610
So you make a profit of 8.

739
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,860
You make a profit of
8 on that 6th unit.

740
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,700

741
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,870
Think of yourself as
climbing this hill.

742
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,730
In economics, optimization is
a hill climbing exercise.

743
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,820
Think of yourself as climbing
up this hill and asking

744
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,460
yourself, should I make
the next unit?

745
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,800
Does the hill keep going up?

746
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,610
Yes, it keeps going up.

747
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,120
Make that next unit.

748
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,090
Then you get to the top.

749
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,070
And now you say, well, should
I make the 7th unit?

750
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:52,560
Well if I make a 7th unit,
my costs are 10 plus

751
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:57,550
half of 49, so 34.5.

752
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:00,410
My revenues are 42.

753
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:03,220
So my profits are only 7.5.

754
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,810
I make less profit
on that 7th unit.

755
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:09,910
So I shouldn't make it.

756
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,240
Now, you might say,
wait a second.

757
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,700

758
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,790
Why wouldn't you make it?

759
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,830
You still make profits.

760
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,340
Why wouldn't you go ahead and
make all units all the way

761
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,050
down to 10?

762
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,330
You still make profits
on those units.

763
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,670
And the answer is because of
opportunity cost. The answer

764
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:31,260
is that yes, you make profits.

765
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,850
But given where your marginal
cost curve is, you could do

766
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:38,440
better by that point going and
producing other goods.

767
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,220
That's why I care about
accounting costs versus

768
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,310
opportunity costs.

769
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:44,050
Accounting costs says look,
you're going to make money

770
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,960
until you go to 10 units.

771
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,460
But opportunity cost says, no.

772
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,000
At that point, the opportunity
cost has gotten high enough

773
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,300
that you could do
better devoting

774
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,980
your resources elsewhere.

775
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,075
And that's why you want to stop
at the point where you're

776
00:33:58,075 --> 00:34:00,810
at the top of the hill, where
the price equals the marginal

777
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:04,250
cost.

778
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,540
So what are the profits you make
at the top of this hill?

779
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:11,830
Well, if you go to the next
diagram, we can see what the

780
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,719
profits you make are.

781
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:17,659
So this next diagram,
Figure 10-3,

782
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,600
illustrates this example.

783
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,030
So what we have here is an
example with cost curves for

784
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:26,290
this cost function, once again,
10 plus 0.5q squared.

785
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:30,389
Average costs is that line
in the middle there.

786
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:32,260
That's the average costs.

787
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:35,560
You have an average variable
cost that's a line, that's

788
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:40,350
linear, an average variable cost
that has a slope of one.

789
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,730
You have an average fixed cost
that's everywhere declining,

790
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,969
because your fixed costs of 10
is everywhere declining.

791
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:46,000
As you produce more
and more, your

792
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,120
fixed costs are declining.

793
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,409
And, as I said, you have
a marginal cost of q.

794
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:53,389
So your marginal cost
of 1 unit is 1.

795
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:57,420
Your marginal cost of 2
units is 2, et cetera.

796
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,290
So this draws out the cost
curves that correspond to that

797
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,200
cost function.

798
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,280
You see them drawn out here.

799
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,090
Now, we also, on this diagram,
have a demand curve.

800
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,910
The demand curve is perfectly
elastic facing this firm.

801
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,530
It's a perfectly competitive
market.

802
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:20,030
And that perfectly elastic
demand curve is horizontal at

803
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:23,520
price equals 6.

804
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,780
So what does the firm do?

805
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:33,720
It chooses to produce where
marginal cost equals price.

806
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,710
When it produces where marginal
cost equals price,

807
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,810
then what profits
does it make?

808
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:48,510

809
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,670
On each unit, it makes a
difference of the profits

810
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:53,870
between the price and average
cost. Now it's an important

811
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,780
distinction.

812
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,090
We went over this in lecture
and section.

813
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,490
But let me go through
it again.

814
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:00,420
Marginal cost is the cost
of the next unit.

815
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,265
Average cost is the average
cost of all the

816
00:36:02,265 --> 00:36:04,040
units you've made.

817
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,240
So if I make 6 units, what
profit do I make?

818
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:15,740
Well, on that 6th unit, I
make a profit of 1 and

819
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:25,700
1/8 or 1 and 1/4.

820
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:31,925

821
00:36:31,925 --> 00:36:36,380
I make profits of 1 and
1/4 on that 6th unit.

822
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:41,020
But I make those profits
on all 8 units I sell.

823
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,770
So what that means is, in total,
I'm going to make a

824
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,970
profit of 8.

825
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,330
The area of this rectangle
is eight.

826
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,790
Here's the key.

827
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:53,900
You cannot choose a production
level that produces a bigger

828
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,270
rectangle than this.

829
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:59,970
So if you produce 7, your
rectangle will be longer.

830
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,910
But the gap between price and
average cost will be smaller.

831
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:07,240
So your total rectangle
size would fall.

832
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,580
The largest rectangle
is produced at a

833
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,390
production level of 6.

834
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:15,610
That's the most efficient use of
your resources is when you

835
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:18,790
produce at a point where
marginal cost equals price.

836
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:21,060
Because when you produce at
marginal cost equals price,

837
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,620
that causes the maximum gap
between price and average

838
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,020
cost.

839
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:29,150
Flip back for a second
to the first figure.

840
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,980

841
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:35,380
Not the first figure,
I'm sorry, 10-2.

842
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,170
This relates back to 10-2.

843
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,510
As I noted, the largest
difference between your

844
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:45,110
revenue and your cost curve
was that 6 units.

845
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,510
That's where the gap is large
between revenue and cost.

846
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,770
That's where you produce.

847
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:52,510
Now we flip forward again
to Figure 10-3.

848
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:56,930
You see that corresponds to the
point of the largest gap

849
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:05,790
between price and average cost,
I'm sorry, the largest

850
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:09,260
of the points on the marginal
cost curve between price and

851
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,100
average cost. So if you produce
on the marginal cost

852
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:17,460
curve, if you produce 7 units,
then you're going to have a

853
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,500
smaller gap between price and
average cost. And, therefore,

854
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,100
even though you produced 1
more unit and are making

855
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,830
profit on it, your total
profits will fall.

856
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:29,090
The key point is that yes,
climbing back down that hill I

857
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,420
still make money.

858
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,670
But I make less and
less money.

859
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:36,670
And that, as a result, that
rectangle is being reduced as

860
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,230
I climb down that hill.

861
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,920
That rectangle is maximized
at the top of that hill.

862
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,680
That's the point at which
I make the most money.

863
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:54,750
So that's why we say profit
maximization occurs at the

864
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,970
point where price equals
marginal cost. Because that is

865
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:01,360
the point of greatest gap
between revenues and costs.

866
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,910
Where price equals marginal cost
is one of the greatest

867
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,220
gaps between revenues
and costs.

868
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,490
That's the profit maximizing
point where that rectangle is

869
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,260
largest. And you can demonstrate
for yourself, and

870
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,030
you should, that at any other
production level, that

871
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:13,970
rectangle will be smaller.

872
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:14,880
Questions about that?

873
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,820
Yeah.

874
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,856
AUDIENCE: What do you
do if you have

875
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,110
a linear cost function.

876
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:21,460
So that means marginal
cost is a constant.

877
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,960
Then how do you determine
the line?

878
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,210
PROFESSOR: You don't.

879
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,310

880
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,590
It's an indeterminacy.

881
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,490
That's right.

882
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,170
I'll try to avoid giving
you problems like that.

883
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,340
Basically you get a
corner solution.

884
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,890
In a perfectly competitive
market, you'd get an

885
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:36,920
indeterminate solution.

886
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,460
In a nonperfectly competitive
market, you will have a

887
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,900
determinant solution.

888
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,610
But in a perfectly competitive
market with a linear marginal

889
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,180
cost, you'd have an
indeterminate solution.

890
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,230
Either you produce
0 or infinity.

891
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,700
So you'd have an indeterminate
solution.

892
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,570

893
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:54,230
Now, just a further drill this
in, imagine, for a second,

894
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:57,140
there was a cost shock
to the firm.

895
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,110
Imagine there was a cost
shock to the firm.

896
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:03,590
Imagine that there's a tax on
the firm where the firm has to

897
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,170
pay a tax of an amount t.

898
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,590
Let's say t is $1.

899
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:13,740
The firm has to pay a tax of $1
on every unit they produce.

900
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,880
Well, what is their
new cost curve?

901
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,960
Somebody tell me what the
new cost curve is.

902
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,640
If you have a tax of $1 on
every unit you produce,

903
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,020
someone tell me the equation
for the cost curve.

904
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,440
I didn't write it down
here, did I?

905
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:24,890
No.

906
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,590
OK, what's the equation
for the cost curve.

907
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,320
Yeah.

908
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,160
AUDIENCE: Just add plus
tq to the top thing.

909
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:40,840
PROFESSOR: Exactly C equals 10
plus 0.5q squared plus tq.

910
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,660
Because for every unit you
produce q you pay a tax t.

911
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,550
And since t is $1, it would
just be plus q.

912
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:49,140
If t is $1, it would
just be plus q.

913
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,760
So the cost function
has now shifted.

914
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,660
So what we see is that it has
shifted average cost and

915
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:59,120
marginal cost both upwards.

916
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,520
Average cost has shifted
upwards by that amount.

917
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,870
And average cost has
shifted upwards.

918
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,950
And marginal cost has shifted
upwards by precisely $1.

919
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,590
It's just a linear shift of
marginal cost. Because

920
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:15,380
marginal cost is now q plus 1.

921
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:19,160
If you differentiate this with
respect to q assuming t is 1--

922
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,350
t is now $1--

923
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,500
if you differentiate this with
respect to q, marginal

924
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,320
cost is q plus 1.

925
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:29,060
So your marginal cost curve has
shifted up by $1 or by t,

926
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,790
in this case, in the
more general case.

927
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:36,570
Well, what does that do to the
first production decision.

928
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:40,910
Well, now it doesn't change
their maximization formula.

929
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:43,410
They still want to set marginal
cost equal to price.

930
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:47,730
So now they say, set q plus
1 equal to price.

931
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:49,590
Well, the price is 6.

932
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:53,100
So it says set q equal to 5.

933
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:58,450
Now the profit maximizing
level is 5 units.

934
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,600
The profit maximizing
level is 5 units.

935
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:05,270

936
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,450
What this is saying is because
the tax increases your

937
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:11,970
marginal cost, you are
now producing less.

938
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:14,310
And what we can see now, if we
flip to Figure 10-4, we can

939
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:16,260
see what that's done
to your profits.

940
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:24,580
Your profits have now fallen to
the dotted rectangle, the

941
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:27,750
much smaller dotted rectangle.

942
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,900
Your profits used to be
that entire slashed

943
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,160
rectangle plus the dots.

944
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,800
Now your profits are just
where the price exceeds

945
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,690
average cost which is just that
smaller dotted rectangle.

946
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,690
Your profits have fallen
dramatically.

947
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:47,140
So by imposing a tax on this
firm, we've dramatically

948
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,390
reduced their profits.

949
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:52,050

950
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:56,870
Now, this is the economics
behind why taxes can lower

951
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,960
production.

952
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,910
Now, you might say,
wait a second.

953
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,830
In reality, if we tax a
firm, the don't have

954
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:03,260
to lower their profits.

955
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:06,290
They just pass it on and charge
consumers higher prices

956
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:08,550
but not in a competitive
market.

957
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,660
In a competitive market,
they can't do that.

958
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:14,250

959
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,896
If you tax a firm in a
competitive market, it comes

960
00:43:15,896 --> 00:43:17,146
out of their profits.

961
00:43:17,146 --> 00:43:19,530

962
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,015
Because they face a perfectly
elastic demand, so they can't

963
00:43:22,015 --> 00:43:23,020
raise the price.

964
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,360
All they can do is just say,
well, the price is the same.

965
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,920
My marginal cost has gone up.

966
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,870
I'm going to produce less, and
I'm going to make less profit.

967
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,900
And that's life.

968
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,390
So a tax in a market like this
is just going to lower the

969
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:36,710
firm's profits, and it's going
to lower their level of

970
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:39,210
production from 6 to 5.

971
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:40,882
In noncompetitive markets,
different things can happen.

972
00:43:40,882 --> 00:43:42,000
We'll talk about that.

973
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,320
But in a competitive market,
this is what

974
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,710
happens with the tax.

975
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:48,260
You basically set the new
marginal cost equal to price,

976
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,940
and you get that they produce
5 units instead of 6 at a

977
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,630
lower profit level.

978
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,592
Yeah?

979
00:43:53,592 --> 00:43:54,772
AUDIENCE: Would that
be a good cause for

980
00:43:54,772 --> 00:43:56,424
entering the market--

981
00:43:56,424 --> 00:43:59,750

982
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:00,040
PROFESSOR: You're right.

983
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,530
That's an excellent point that
I should have pointed out.

984
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:04,770
What do I mean by short run?

985
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:07,420
What I mean by short run is
remember, labor is variable.

986
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,470
Capital is fixed.

987
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:09,650
What do I mean in
this context?

988
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,510
Think about the short run as
being the period over time

989
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,035
over which firms cannot
enter and exit.

990
00:44:13,035 --> 00:44:15,980

991
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,450
When we talk about competitive
markets in the short run, we

992
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:20,550
talked about short run
being the time in

993
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:21,780
which capital is fixed.

994
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,190
Now we're going to add
another condition.

995
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,090
We're going to say the short run
is the period of time in

996
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:31,830
which there's no firm
entry or exit.

997
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:32,520
That's the short run.

998
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,730
We'll come back and talk about
what entry and exit does.

999
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,510
And that's going to have
some funky effects.

1000
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,000
We'll talk about
that next time.

1001
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,920
But what we mean by short
run here is no

1002
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,680
firm entry and exit.

1003
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,510
Whichever firms are in the
market at the beginning of the

1004
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:46,040
short run people are in the
market at the end of the short

1005
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:46,430
run period.

1006
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:47,315
Yeah.

1007
00:44:47,315 --> 00:44:49,343
AUDIENCE: But in your
conditions, you had like free

1008
00:44:49,343 --> 00:44:51,250
and fluid entry and
exit of firms.

1009
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:51,910
PROFESSOR: Right, exactly.

1010
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:54,810
And that's why I said, don't
pay attention to that yet.

1011
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:56,190
In some sense, those are the
conditions of perfect

1012
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:56,670
competition.

1013
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,090
I didn't say if that was
short run or long run.

1014
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:00,270
Those are the full long
run set of conditions.

1015
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:02,220
That's why I said we're going
to ignore four for now and

1016
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,530
just focus on the first three.

1017
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:05,720
In the short run, only the
first three are relevant.

1018
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,790
Because in the short run there's
no firm entry or exit.

1019
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:09,670
In the long run, which we'll
talk about next time, that

1020
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:12,020
fourth one will be relevant.

1021
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:12,720
Good question.

1022
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,320
That's a good point.

1023
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,830
Thank you for pointing
that out.

1024
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:17,400
Other questions or comments?

1025
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,240
One other thing I want to cover
before we stop which

1026
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,970
relates to the long run, is that
in the long run, this is

1027
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:26,340
sort of the transition,
the bridge to talking

1028
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,840
about the long run.

1029
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,570
We also have to decide,
ultimately, whether or not we

1030
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:34,730
want to shut the firm down.

1031
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,890
So, in other words, we want to
set price equal to marginal

1032
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:38,530
cost. That's one condition.

1033
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:40,710
But, actually, short run profit
maximization has a

1034
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,040
second condition.

1035
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,720
Short run profit maximization
has two conditions.

1036
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,190
The first is to set price equal
to marginal cost. The

1037
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:51,490
second condition of short run
profit maximization is to

1038
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:53,920
check whether the firm
wants to shut down.

1039
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,860

1040
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,170
Why would a firm want
to shut down?

1041
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:02,080
It might want to shut down if
it actually loses money by

1042
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,330
continuing to produce.

1043
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:06,120

1044
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:12,540
And that's because firms may
lose money but not shut down.

1045
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,600
Firms may lose money
but not shut down.

1046
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,090
Or firms may lose so much
money they shut down.

1047
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:19,520
And we need to consider that.

1048
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,760

1049
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,700
Let's get rid of the tax.

1050
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,390
Let's go back to the marginal
cost with the tax.

1051
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:28,040
Imagine the price in this
market suddenly

1052
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,560
fell from 6 to 3.

1053
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:35,350
The price of the market is
now $3 per unit you sell.

1054
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:37,835
Well what would the
firm's profits be?

1055
00:46:37,835 --> 00:46:42,060
Well, if the price fell to 3,
the firm would choose to

1056
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,790
produce 3 units.

1057
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:46,480
You would still have this
condition, marginal cost

1058
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:46,970
equals price.

1059
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,580
Price is 3, and marginal
cost is q.

1060
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,960
So q is 3.

1061
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,650
You still produce 3 units.

1062
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:54,970
If you produce 3 units,
its costs are 10 plus

1063
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:58,530
4.5 which is 14.5.

1064
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:01,250
At a price of 3, it makes 9.

1065
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:05,360
So its profits are
negative 5.5.

1066
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,370
It would lose money from
this production.

1067
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:12,660

1068
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,640
Remember marginal cost
equals price.

1069
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,160
That doesn't vary with what
the price is or anything.

1070
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,680
This is a maximizing
condition.

1071
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,770
If a price changed, it's not
like you change which equation

1072
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:23,080
you follow.

1073
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,500
You always follow
this equation.

1074
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,800
The efficient production level
is always marginal cost equals

1075
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,330
price regardless of
what the price is.

1076
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:31,800
So if the price is 3, the
efficient thing to do would be

1077
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,710
to produce 3 units
and lose money.

1078
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,610
Now, you might say, well,
then that's stupid.

1079
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:41,300
If that goes negative, wouldn't
they just shut down?

1080
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:44,070
And the answer, is in
the short run, no.

1081
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,530
And the reason you wouldn't shut
down in the short run is

1082
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:51,270
what I talked about last time
which is about the notion of

1083
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:53,680
sunk costs.

1084
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,350
In the short run, the fixed
costs that you paid

1085
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:58,830
to produce are sunk.

1086
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,560
They're unchangeable
in the short run.

1087
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,040
In the long run, they're
changeable.

1088
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,390
You can just leave.

1089
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:06,430
But in the short run, you've
invested fixed costs of 10 in

1090
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:07,600
being in this market.

1091
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,520
You've paid a fixed cost of 10
to produce in this market.

1092
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:17,200
Given you're in this market, and
you've paid 10 to produce,

1093
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:22,010
you will not exit unless
you lose more than $10.

1094
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:27,670
You will not shut down unless
you lose more than $10.

1095
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,480
You will not shut down unless
you're losing so much money

1096
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,510
that you can't cover
your fixed costs.

1097
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,380
Because you've paid those fixed
cost. In the short run,

1098
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,280
they're sunk.

1099
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,180
So unless you're actually losing
more than your fixed

1100
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:44,740
costs, you will not shut
down your firm.

1101
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:45,770
OK.

1102
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:47,145
This is actually pretty
confusing, and

1103
00:48:47,145 --> 00:48:47,680
we're out of time.

1104
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,410
So what I'm going to do is we'll
pick it up on Monday

1105
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:51,870
exactly at this point.

1106
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:53,670
And I'll go through some more
of the intuition for this.

1107
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:56,180
And that will be our segue for
talking long run profit

1108
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,710
maximization which we'll
talk about on Monday.

1109
00:48:58,710 --> 00:48:59,960
