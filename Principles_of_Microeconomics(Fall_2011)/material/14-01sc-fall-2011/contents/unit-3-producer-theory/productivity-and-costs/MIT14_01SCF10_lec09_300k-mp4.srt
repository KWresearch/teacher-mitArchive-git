00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:24,690
JON GRUBER: At the beginning of
the lecture, we're going to

11
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,600
actually talk about
productivity, one of the most

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,600
important topics in economics.

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,920
And really one of the most
famous applications--

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,095
or, more generally,
misapplications--

15
00:00:34,095 --> 00:00:37,260
of the principles of diminishing
marginal product

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,540
in the history of economics.

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,400
Many of you may have heard of
a guy named Thomas Malthus.

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,620
He was a famous philosopher
who, in 1798, posited the

19
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,460
theory that we're all
in big trouble.

20
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,950
And he did so following the
basic tenets that I've taught

21
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,430
you so far.

22
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,910
Malthus pointed out
look, we've got--

23
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,290
he said, think about
production of food.

24
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,420
He said, with the production
of food you've got, as with

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,129
any other production process--
he didn't put it in these

26
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,640
terms, but basically he was
appealing to what we

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,330
learned last time.

28
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,890
He said, like any other
production process you've got

29
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,680
two inputs, labor and capital.

30
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,790
But with food, the
capital is land.

31
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,490
And unlike other kinds of
capital, it's fixed even in

32
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,870
the long-run.

33
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,960
That is, we talked about the
long-run being defined as the

34
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,240
period of time over which
all inputs are variable.

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,660
Well, land is never variable.

36
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,840
There's a certain amount
of land on

37
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,150
earth, that's not variable.

38
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,800
And at the end of the day,
production of food is

39
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,940
essentially just short-run,
there is no long-run.

40
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,880
At the end of the day,
production of food, capital's

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,300
fixed, it's only labor.

42
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,130
Moreover, in that situation
labor has diminishing marginal

43
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,810
product with a given
amount of land.

44
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,440
It doesn't matter how many
workers you have, there's only

45
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,290
so much you can grow on it.

46
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,320
Obviously, as you increase
workers you can grow more

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,010
originally.

48
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,110
But eventually, you'll run out
of useful use for those

49
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:00,170
workers, yet the demand for food
will not stop growing.

50
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,140
So basically, the demand for
food is going to continue to

51
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,140
grow unabated over time
as population grows.

52
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,850
Demand for food [? it fuels ?]
proportional to population, so

53
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,539
it's growing over time.

54
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,960
Yet the production of food
eventually has to slow down,

55
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,170
because there's a diminishing
marginal product of labor

56
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,100
without an increasing capital.

57
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,590
So basically what you've got is
a forever growing demand,

58
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,290
but a gradually slowing
production, because the

59
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,450
marginal product of labor's
diminishing with this fixed

60
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,230
capital or land.

61
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,145
The result is mass starvation.

62
00:02:31,145 --> 00:02:34,850
So Malthus predicted that by
about where we are now, if not

63
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,270
before, the world would
be suffering from mass

64
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,370
starvation.

65
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,590
Through the basic principles--

66
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,620
not because he's a
crazy nutcase--

67
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,950
but the basic principles
we've studied so far.

68
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,140
Which you've got ever-increasing
demand, but

69
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,270
diminishing marginal product
of producing food.

70
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,520
And in the end you get
mass starvation.

71
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,810
Well, as we all know
Malthus was wrong.

72
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,620
World population has risen about
800% since he wrote his

73
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,810
article at the end of the
18th century, and yet

74
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,220
we're fatter than ever.

75
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,790
Our problem is we eat too
much, not enough.

76
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,850
Now that's not true
around the world,

77
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,250
there's starvation elsewhere.

78
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,670
But there's clearly no more
starvation worldwide than

79
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,590
there was at his time despite
the fact that the world

80
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,790
population has grown
eight-fold.

81
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,340
So what did Malthus get wrong?

82
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,510
What Malthus got wrong is what
I haven't taught you yet.

83
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,410
Which is that aggregate
production is not just about k

84
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,530
and l, but also about
productivity.

85
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,090
It's also about productivity.

86
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,585
That the production function
really looks like-- the form

87
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:46,850
of the production function,
which we wrote last time as q

88
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,280
equals f of k and l.

89
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,250
Really more generally, can be
written as q equals A, times f

90
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,980
of k and l, where A is aggregate
productivity.

91
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,620

92
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,870
Really, let's say that this is
big Q. If we think about the

93
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,310
big Q for society, now let's
think of aggregate quantity

94
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,260
for society or else
we wouldn't talk

95
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,510
about a specific firm.

96
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,820
But if we think about aggregate
product, aggregate

97
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,830
quantity produced in society,
it's a function of the

98
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,329
aggregate capital and labor
of the society, but also a

99
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:20,470
function of productivity.

100
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,580
It's also a function of the fact
that we use our inputs

101
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,110
more effectively over time.

102
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,260
So for example, one thing
Malthus missed is that the

103
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,830
acreage of land-- it's an
empirical fact, the number of

104
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,930
acres of land on Earth
are fixed.

105
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,910
Earth is not growing--

106
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,940
but the arability of that
land is not fixed.

107
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,660
We get better and better at
figuring out how to grow more

108
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,230
and more stuff on the
same amount of land.

109
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,570
That's the factor A, that's a
productivity improvement.

110
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,640
Likewise, agricultural
technology has improved.

111
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,060
We have disease-resistant seeds,
we have better land

112
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,040
management.

113
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,760
The bottom line is we are making
more and more of a

114
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,770
given plot of land compared to
what Malthus saw in his time.

115
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:12,840
So while k if it's defined as
land may be fixed, and l

116
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,860
therefore there's diminishing
marginal product of a given

117
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,600
production function, the
production function itself is

118
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,120
improving over time because of
productivity improvements.

119
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,070
Productivity, the arability of
land, disease-resistant seeds,

120
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,540
and other things are making that
given quantity of land

121
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,460
more productive over time.

122
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,295
So effectively, in the long-run
if A goes up faster

123
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:41,400
than the marginal product of
labor diminishes, then overall

124
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,235
quantity can increase even
though k, the underlying level

125
00:05:44,235 --> 00:05:46,690
of land, is fixed.

126
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,720
That's what Malthus missed, is
that there's two factors going

127
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,090
on over time.

128
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,350
The marginal product of labor's
falling, it's true,

129
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,800
for a given plot of land.

130
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,800
But we're making each plot of
land so much more productive,

131
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,350
it's overcoming that.

132
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,230
And as a result, food production
is actually rising

133
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,950
per capita.

134
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:10,430
So since 1950, world food
consumption per capita has

135
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,170
gone up 40%.

136
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,370
Despite the fact that the
Earth's not gotten any bigger,

137
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,980
and despite the fact the
population's grown a

138
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,650
lot over that time.

139
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,020
And basically this huge increase
of agricultural

140
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,690
productivity has overcome
the diminishing

141
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,880
marginal product of labor.

142
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,410
There's actually a great little
box in the Perloff Text

143
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,980
about a single individual and
his contributions to that.

144
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,550

145
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,160
A scientist who led what's
called the Green Revolution.

146
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,470
He experimented in Mexico with
different methods of improving

147
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,900
agricultural productivity, and
then essentially brought those

148
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,870
to Southeast Asia--

149
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,260
India, Pakistan and
other places.

150
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,120
And they estimate, saved about
a billion lives through the

151
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,730
increase in agriculture
productivity he made possible

152
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:06,850
for this Green Revolution
in Southeast Asia.

153
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,080
Really, just changed the entire
trajectory of that part

154
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,580
of the world through the
agricultural productivity

155
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,830
improvements that
he put in place.

156
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,800
So it's very interesting putting
a personal face on

157
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,860
this impersonal letter A, how
one scientist can really make

158
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,020
a difference in that case.

159
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,630
This also leads to the larger
question which this course

160
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,330
doesn't spent a lot of time
on, but which is more of a

161
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,660
macro question, which is what
determines the overall

162
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,270
standard of living
in our country?

163
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,010
The standard of living in our
country, that is basically for

164
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:44,850
a given level of labor we
supply, what determines the

165
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,860
level of our utility, of our
social welfare, given how much

166
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,880
labor we can supply?

167
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,480
Well, ultimately, what's going
to determine-- or another way

168
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,030
to think of it is what
determines the amount of stuff

169
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:02,350
we can have for a given amount
of labor effort we put in?

170
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,790
Well, that's society's
productivity.

171
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:11,980
Society's productivity is how
much more we can have for each

172
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,940
given level of labor input.

173
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,280
So what determines how much
stuff we can have?

174
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:24,150
Well, it's k and A. Given a
fixed amount of labor input,

175
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,260
given how much we work, what
determines how much stuff we

176
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,000
can have, with how much capital
we have, and how

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,010
productively we make
use of it?

178
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:38,590
Now, productivity in the
US has followed a very

179
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,280
interesting trend.

180
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,200
So productivity, which is how
much we produce for a given

181
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,150
amount of inputs, has followed
an interesting trend.

182
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:50,800
From World War II until about
1973, productivity grew

183
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,880
rapidly in the US.

184
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,800
Productivity grew at about
2.3% per year--

185
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,720
2.4% per year--

186
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,580
from the end of World
War II through 1973.

187
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,400
That is, working no harder and
having no more machines, we

188
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,330
can consume 2.4% more stuff
every single year.

189
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,070

190
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,370
That's pretty impressive.

191
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,182
That means we can just sit
around, work no harder than we

192
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:15,120
were, and have no more machines,
and produce 2.4%

193
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,860
more per year.

194
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,500
Now, of course, over time we
worked harder and had more

195
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,850
machines, so overall output in
US economy grew much faster

196
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,820
than 2.4% a year.

197
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,050
It grew more like 7-10% a
year over that period.

198
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:31,860
Yet, the point is that a lot of
that we can get for free,

199
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,440
essentially, without any harder

200
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,340
work or any more capital.

201
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,090
However, starting in 1973
until the early 1990s,

202
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:43,530
productivity growth fell
dramatically to 1% per year.

203
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,940
That is literally we lost 1 1/2%
per year of stuff we were

204
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,990
getting before.

205
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,040
We were getting 2 1/2% a year
up to '73, all of a sudden

206
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,460
it's down to 1%.

207
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,280
That's 1 1/2% a year less stuff
we can get unless we

208
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,330
work harder to make up for it.

209
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,340
Why did this happen?

210
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,780
Well, we don't exactly know,
but there's two good

211
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,720
candidates.

212
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,940
We know the two candidates, we
just don't know the right

213
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,270
proportions.

214
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:11,410
One is that we have less capital
in our society because

215
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,530
savings fell.

216
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,610
The amount of savings US
households do fell

217
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,640
dramatically.

218
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,110
And the US has a very
low savings rate.

219
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,790
The US savings rate over this
period averaged about 3%.

220
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,640
That is, every dollar
we earned we saved

221
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,460
about 3% as a society.

222
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,760
Compared to countries
like Japan, where

223
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,560
it's more like 20%.

224
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,320
Every dollar they earn
they save about 20%.

225
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,430
Now why does that matter?

226
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,420
Well, we'll talk about this
later in the course, but

227
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,500
essentially the amount we save
determines the amount of

228
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,640
capital we have in society.

229
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,490
Because essentially, where
do firms get the

230
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,910
money to build machines?

231
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,000
They get it by borrowing from
households who save. And the

232
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,180
less we save, the less money
there is that firms could

233
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,460
invest in building machines.

234
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,420
And we'll talk about that at
length later in the semester.

235
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,900
But the bottom line is, the more
we save as a country, the

236
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,640
more money we have available,
the more firms can take that

237
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,960
money and build machines
that improve

238
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,150
our standard of living.

239
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,890
And that saving fell a lot,
and that's one reason.

240
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,530

241
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:14,020
And the other reason is that
productivity fell for reasons

242
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,590
we don't quite understand.

243
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,360
We know that productivity slowed
down, but we don't

244
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,410
quite understand why that is.

245
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:28,200
But then in the 1990s,
productivity shot up again.

246
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,020
So productivity went back up
towards our historic levels,

247
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,670
from 1% back up to
over 2% a year.

248
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,740
Why is that?

249
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,030
Well, it's unclear, but we think
it's basically the IT

250
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,660
revolution.

251
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,610
Essentially, we think that the
slow diffusion of computers,

252
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,670
which people were predicting
should increase productivity

253
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,560
as way back as the 1980s,
suddenly in the 1990s it

254
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,700
really happened.

255
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,920
And this IT revolution led to
a big productivity increase.

256
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,250
It's not clear if that's dying
down now again, or if it's

257
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,350
going to continue.

258
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,440
It'll be interesting
to see what happens

259
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,360
over the next 15 years.

260
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,250
So we have this period of high
productivity growth, slowed

261
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:08,870
down from '73 to the early '90s
and then picked up again.

262
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,990
We're not quite clear if that
year's coming to an end or

263
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:16,600
not, but that's sort of where we
are now in that time path.

264
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,100
What's very interesting--

265
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,675
so that's what happens to
productivity, that's all I'll

266
00:12:19,675 --> 00:12:21,820
talk about it for this course,
it's more of a macro topic.

267
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,150
But I will mention
an interesting

268
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,210
micro spin on that.

269
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,880
Which is, if society's more
productive, that's like found

270
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,060
money for society.

271
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,540
That's like saying with all our
resources we suddenly get

272
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,020
extra money.

273
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,730
Society then has to decide
what to do with that.

274
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,010
The US and Europe have followed
very different paths

275
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,260
in what to do with that money.

276
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,070
In the US, we've taken
that money and

277
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,120
bought a lot more stuff.

278
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,420
We have the highest standard
of living in the world.

279
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,900
We buy the most stuff per capita
of anyone the world.

280
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,330
In Europe, they took a lot of
that money and took more

281
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,790
leisure with it.

282
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,200
They decided we're not going to
quite have as much stuff,

283
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,710
but we're going to have six
weeks a year of vacation

284
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,710
instead of two weeks
a year of vacation.

285
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:06,140
So if we go back to our
discussion of what determines

286
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,240
labor supply is the choice
between leisure and

287
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,730
consumption, and you think of
the wage as the opportunity

288
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,290
cost of leisure, well, what
they've decided in Europe is

289
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,360
to choose more along the leisure
axis, and less along

290
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,460
the consumption axis.

291
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,490
In the US, we've chosen less
among the leisure axis-- we

292
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,000
work way harder than Europe--

293
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
but we have more stuff.

294
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,860
And the question is, how do
we feel about that choice?

295
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,610
Has that been ultimately a
welfare maximizing choice?

296
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,345
Now an economist will say of
course it's been, because it's

297
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:35,650
a choice we made.

298
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,750
Of course, it's been
welfare maximizing.

299
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,670
We talk about revealed
preference, and people's

300
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,800
choices reveal what
they prefer.

301
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,225
So our revealed preference, we
just prefer stuff more and

302
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:46,290
leisure less than Europe.

303
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,690
But in fact, it's not clear that
that is each individual's

304
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,340
optimal choice.

305
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,320
If a given individual says,
look, I'd rather have less

306
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,490
stuff and more time off, it may
be hard to find the job

307
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,260
that lets them do that.

308
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,170
So while that may be the choice
we've made as a society

309
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,180
with our social institutions,
that may not serve the

310
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,340
interests of every individual
in society.

311
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,380
And that's the kind
of trade-off we

312
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,870
need to think about.

313
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,725
So anyway, that's sort of
what I wanted to say on

314
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:09,220
productivity.

315
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:09,880
Yeah, question?

316
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,826
AUDIENCE: Does higher
productivity translate into

317
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:17,490
more income, or more income for
individuals who will buy

318
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,718
stuff [INAUDIBLE] taking
more leisure?

319
00:14:18,718 --> 00:14:21,510
JON GRUBER: Because basically
the point is think of our

320
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,750
economy as a pie.

321
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:29,280
That basically the idea is
let's think of you have a

322
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:36,170
start up, and your start up is
such that you can make this

323
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:40,640
product, and you could
make $1 million a

324
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,180
year with 10 workers.

325
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,230
You could make $1
million worth of

326
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,065
stuff with 10 workers.

327
00:14:46,065 --> 00:14:49,460
So each of your workers
takes home $100,000.

328
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,070
Now imagine that you discover
new technology which lets you,

329
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,470
with the same amount
of workers, make

330
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,100
$2 million a year.

331
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,180
Well, some of that you'll keep,
but some of it you'll

332
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,880
pay your workers more.

333
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,330
So suddenly they have more
money, because you've suddenly

334
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:07,020
managed to make twice as
valuable stuff with the same

335
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,050
amount of resources.

336
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,150
So that's the situation
which improves

337
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,850
our standard of living.

338
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,900
Other questions about that?

339
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,930
Comments?

340
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,370
OK, so the bottom line, coming
back to sort of micro-theory

341
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,960
we're talking about, is we have
to think about production

342
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,870
functions as having a
productivity adjustment.

343
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,385
Macro raises these big issues
about sort of ultimately what

344
00:15:23,385 --> 00:15:25,280
determines our standard of
living in this country, and

345
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,270
how do we want to spend
that money?

346
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:31,050
So, with that as background,
we're now going to stop

347
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,920
talking about production
and move on

348
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,050
to cost. Cost is--

349
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,150
quite frankly this is perhaps my
least favorite thing in the

350
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,660
whole course.

351
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,210
It's a little bit boring, but
you need to understand how

352
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,500
cost structure in a firm works
to understand how firms make

353
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,010
the decisions that ultimately
get to be a lot more

354
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,970
interesting again, so just
sort of bear with me.

355
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,030
Now, so we talked about costs,
let's start with a couple of

356
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,430
definitions.

357
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,510
Basically, let's back up, where
are we coming from?

358
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,550
I talked about what the firm's
decision is, the firm has to

359
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:08,860
maximize profits, which is
revenues minus cost. So we

360
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,040
have to ask what are costs if
we're going to make this

361
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,230
profit maximizing decision.

362
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,770
Well, costs are going to
have a few components.

363
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:19,450
The first component, costs are
going to have really two major

364
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,420
components--

365
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:26,355
fixed costs, and
variable costs.

366
00:16:26,355 --> 00:16:29,600

367
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,370
Fixed costs and variable
costs.

368
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,476
Fixed costs are the costs of
inputs that cannot be varied

369
00:16:35,476 --> 00:16:36,450
in the short-run.

370
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,280
Remember, I said that the
short-run is defined as a

371
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,570
period over time which only
some inputs can vary.

372
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,580
Well, fixed costs are the costs
of those inputs that

373
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,390
can't vary in the short-run.

374
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,090
Variable costs--

375
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,040
so that's like capital
in the short-run--

376
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,630
variable costs are the cost of
goods that can vary in the

377
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,770
short run, that's like labor.

378
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:04,440
So total costs is the sum of
these two, so total costs

379
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:09,900
equals fixed cost plus
variable cost.

380
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,869
Finally, another definition
that's important is marginal

381
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:20,849
cost, which is the change in
cost with a change in output.

382
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,520
So the marginal cost
is just like--

383
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,240
remember, we want to think in
terms of marginal decision

384
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,950
making in this course.

385
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,840
So the marginal cost is the
change in cost with the change

386
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,720
in-- actually, that should
be a little q.

387
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,050
The change in a firm's cost with
the change in the firm's

388
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,980
output is marginal cost.

389
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,800
And then finally, average cost
is just what it sounds like.

390
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:53,270
Average cost is just c over
q, it's just the average.

391
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,480
So the difference between
marginal and average cost, is

392
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,690
basically average costs is the
average over the whole set of

393
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,250
goods produced.

394
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,580
Marginal cost is the cost of
that next unit of production.

395
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,110
So those are our key
definitions.

396
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:08,300
Now with those in mind, let's
ask how do we get costs?

397
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,020
And the answer is we get them
from the production function.

398
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,730
Once we do a production
function, we can derive costs.

399
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:21,895
So if we have some production
function, q equals f of l and

400
00:18:21,895 --> 00:18:40,290
k, then we can say the cost of
producing q is equal to f of

401
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:43,930
wl plus rk.

402
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:49,160
Where w is the wage rate, or the
rate you pay per unit of

403
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:55,490
labor, and r is the rental rate,
or the rate you pay per

404
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,740
unit of capital.

405
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,650

406
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,830
Now, let me just pause here
for a second to talk about

407
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,840
pricing capital.

408
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,960
It's easy to think the cost of
an hour of labor, it's the

409
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,410
wage you pay for an hour.

410
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,410
It's harder to think about the
cost of a unit of capital.

411
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,100
Because we buy the
machines, right?

412
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,240
So how do we think
about the cost?

413
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,690
I'm going to cover this later in
the course, for now imagine

414
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,390
all machines are rented.

415
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,670
Imagine you rent every
machine you use.

416
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:24,530
And think of r as the rental
price of that unit of capital.

417
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,970
So with buildings it make sense,
firms often rent the

418
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,210
buildings they're in.

419
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,520
Think of r as the rental price
of that unit of building, or

420
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,620
that unit of machine.

421
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,260
We'll come back later to see why
that's a sensible way to

422
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,000
think about it.

423
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,200
The key point is, the reason we
have to do this is the wage

424
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,360
is a flow measure, every hour
I pay you a new wage.

425
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,020
If I use the cost of buying the
machine, that be a stock

426
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,800
measure, so you couldn't really
compare it to wages.

427
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,010
So we want to use
a flow measure.

428
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,656
The flow measures is what we
have to pay every period to

429
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:50,560
rent the machine.

430
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:50,990
Yeah?

431
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,421
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

432
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:55,283
just take the cost of the
machine and estimate the

433
00:19:55,283 --> 00:19:59,576
amount of time we want,
and then divide it?

434
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:00,465
JON GRUBER: Sure.

435
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:01,920
No, and I'll cover that later.

436
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,150
You could think of
the rental--

437
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:07,420
if I bought the machine today
and sold it tomorrow, that'd

438
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,940
be like I rented it.

439
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,160
And this would be the cost
difference between what I paid

440
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,750
for it and what I'd
sell it for.

441
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,420
But it's just easier to think
of it as the rental, because

442
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,310
the flow measure-- like the
wage-- is a flow measure.

443
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,030

444
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:25,540
Now, in the short-run,
capital is fixed.

445
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:34,950
So in the short-run, our
fixed costs are rk bar.

446
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,280
That's our fixed cost, the
rental rate times the fixed

447
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,210
amount of capital in
the short-run.

448
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:48,980
And our variable costs are
w times l, which is

449
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,280
a function of q.

450
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,860
That is, the more you produce
the more labor

451
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,390
you use in the short-run.

452
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,140
So total costs in the short-run,
short-run total

453
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:06,236
costs, are rk bar
plus wL of q.

454
00:21:06,236 --> 00:21:08,230
k is not a function of q because
k's fixed in the

455
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,350
short-run, but the amount of
labor used is a function of

456
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,600
how much you produce.

457
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,600

458
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,720
This implies that the marginal
cost, the key concept we want

459
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,880
to work with, marginal cost,
which is the derivative of

460
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,180
total costs with respect
to quantity.

461
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:34,500
So dc dq is going to
be equal to w--

462
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,260
or, let's do it in deltas,
because we're not doing

463
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:36,730
calculus here.

464
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:44,090
Delta c delta q is going to be
w times delta l over delta q.

465
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,490
That's going to be the
marginal cost.

466
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:49,290
The marginal cost-- so I'm just
differentiating the total

467
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,670
cost function--

468
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:54,420
is going to be the wage
times delta l delta q.

469
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,170
So the marginal cost of
producing the next unit is

470
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,840
going to be how much labor I
have to produce to produce the

471
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,450
next unit, times the wage
I pay per unit of labor.

472
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,460
Now, does anyone remember
what we call this?

473
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,990
I know this wasn't on the exam
last night, so you may not--

474
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,620
cast your mind back to the
lecture on Monday.

475
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,530
Do you remember what we call
delta l over delta q?

476
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:18,690
Anyone?

477
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,652
Bueller?

478
00:22:20,652 --> 00:22:21,460
No?

479
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,870
It's the marginal product
of labor.

480
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,020
Remember from Monday?

481
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:28,500
So this is the wage times the
marginal product of labor.

482
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:36,380
So what we say is that the
marginal cost is equal to the

483
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:42,380
wage times the marginal--

484
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,250
I'm sorry the wage over.

485
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,450
I'm sorry, it's one over.

486
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,180
That delta q does-- l was
the marginal product.

487
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,410
The wage over the marginal
product of labor.

488
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,240
So marginal cost is
the wage over the

489
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,490
marginal product of labor.

490
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,990
Marginal product of labor was
delta q delta l, so wage over

491
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:00,310
the marginal product of labor
is the marginal cost.

492
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,090
So think about this
intuitively.

493
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:07,030
What we're saying is the cost of
the next unit of production

494
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:10,550
is declining with the marginal
product of labor, it sort of

495
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,020
makes sense.

496
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,090
The more productive is a worker,
the less expensive is

497
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,090
producing the next unit.

498
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,600
The less productive is the
next worker, the more

499
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,710
expensive is producing
the next unit.

500
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,330
So it's an inverse relationship
between the

501
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:27,710
marginal cost and the marginal
product where the wage is the

502
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:32,870
constant that scales
that relationship.

503
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:37,370
So basically, when workers are
very, very high marginal

504
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,250
product, then it's going
to be cheap to

505
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,805
produce the next unit.

506
00:23:40,805 --> 00:23:42,886
When workers have a low marginal
product, it's going

507
00:23:42,886 --> 00:23:44,720
to be expensive to produce the
next unit, and that's going to

508
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,440
depend on what you actually
have to pay the worker.

509
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,330
Questions about that?

510
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,490
So basically, the first key
thing we want to derive here

511
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:58,000
is that the marginal cost is
directly related to the

512
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,780
marginal product of labor, and
the marginal product of labor

513
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,410
we saw last time comes out
of production function.

514
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:07,330
So if you're given a wage, and
given a production function,

515
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:11,006
you should be able to derive the
short-run marginal cost.

516
00:24:11,006 --> 00:24:14,230
You might someday be
asked to do that.

517
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,480
Now what about the long-run?

518
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,590

519
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,620
The short-run's no fun, what
about the long-run?

520
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,070
In the long-run, firms
can choose their mix

521
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,940
of labor and capital.

522
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,530
Remember, in the short-run the
capital is fixed, so fixed

523
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,320
costs rk bar.

524
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,010
The only thing they could
change was the amount of

525
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,610
labor, so we could derive
their marginal costs.

526
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,490
What about in the long-run?

527
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,630
Well, the long-run's a little
more interesting because in

528
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:43,350
the long-run firms get to choose
their input mix to

529
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,510
maximize their production
efficiency.

530
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:53,730
So input mix is chosen to
maximize production efficiency

531
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:57,970
which equates to minimizing
costs.

532
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:01,140
Maximizing production efficiency
equates to

533
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,130
minimizing costs.

534
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:08,310
So we talked last time about
isoquants, and the notion that

535
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:13,010
isoquants were combinations
of labor and capital that

536
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,960
delivered the same output.

537
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,635
Just like indifference curves
are combinations of pizza and

538
00:25:18,635 --> 00:25:22,400
movies that deliver the same
utility, isoquants are a

539
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,840
combination of labor
and capital that

540
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,270
deliver the same output.

541
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:31,150
The key point is that,
technologically, any choice of

542
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,930
labor and capital produces the
same q, so there's nothing

543
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,540
that tells you technologically
which of those to use.

544
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:41,000
We just know, technologically,
there's a set of choices which

545
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,080
deliver the same q.

546
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,400
Well, how do we tell
which to use?

547
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,710
Well, we want to choose the one
which is minimizing costs.

548
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,890
So to do that, we're going to
have to bring in the cost of

549
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:51,900
those inputs.

550
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,230
Just like we said there's a set
of pizza and movies, all

551
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,460
of which leave you
indifferent.

552
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,300
How do you decide which pizza
and movies to choose?

553
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,660
Well, you bring in the
relative price

554
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,800
of pizza and movies.

555
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,050
Here, we're going to bring in
the relative price of capital

556
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,980
and labor to determine
how we choose

557
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,340
between capital and labor.

558
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,840
So to do that, we're going to
draw isocost lines which are

559
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,530
going to be just like our
old budget constraints.

560
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:20,530
Isocost lines which represent
the cost of different

561
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:24,290
combinations of inputs, just
like our old budget constraint

562
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,390
represented the cost of
different consumption goods.

563
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:31,940
So if you look at figure 9-1,
here we're going to have

564
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,290
isocost curves which are
going to represent--

565
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:40,460
and we're going to assume here
that the wage is $5 an hour,

566
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,760
and the rental rate is $10
per unit of capital.

567
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,580

568
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,630
So, in other words, the $50
isocost line in figure 9-1

569
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:56,120
shows all combinations
of labor and

570
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,970
capital that cost $50.

571
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,970
So you could spend $50 in
production if you had 10 units

572
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,490
of labor, and no units
of capital.

573
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,620
Or five units of capital, and
no units of labor, or any

574
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,060
combination in between.

575
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,610
These are all the combinations
of labor and

576
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,270
capital that cost $50.

577
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:18,090
Likewise, the $100 isocost is
all combinations of labor and

578
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,920
capital that cost $100.

579
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:32,020
So each of these isocosts give
you the combination of inputs

580
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,150
that cost a certain amount.

581
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,740
Just like a budget constraint
gave you the combination of

582
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,640
pizza and movies on which
you spent your income.

583
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,520
Now, you may have said well,
wait a second, the difference

584
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,980
with consumers is we knew their
income so we knew what

585
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,230
their budget constraint is.

586
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:50,470
Here we don't know whether to
choose the $50 cost, the $100

587
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,140
cost, $150.

588
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,070
We don't know what the
total amount is.

589
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,510
That's what makes firms
hard, that's why we

590
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,700
have an extra step.

591
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,930
So hold that thought,
we'll come back

592
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,180
to that next lecture.

593
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,590
For now, let's just say there's
a set of trade-offs

594
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:05,720
that the firm can choose from,
and a set of isoquants that

595
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,430
they have.

596
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:10,030
And what's the slope of
this isocost line?

597
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:13,120
It's the negative of the
wage rental ratio.

598
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:19,210
The slope of the isocost
is minus w over r.

599
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,590
The slope is minus w over r.

600
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:26,170
It's basically the trade-off
between labor and capital's

601
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,180
going to be determined by the
relative prices of those

602
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:32,770
inputs, so slope is going
to be minus w over r.

603
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:35,790
So basically, how many units of
capital do you have to give

604
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,020
up to get the next
unit of labor?

605
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:42,600
Well, what this isocost tells
you is you have to give up 1/2

606
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,020
a unit of capital to get
a unit of labor.

607
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,440
So the slope is minus 1/2.

608
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,390
Likewise, you could say you have
to give up two units of

609
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,370
labor to get one unit
of capital.

610
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:56,490
So that's why the slope is minus
1/2, that's what it's

611
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,390
telling us.

612
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:00,170
Once again, budget constraints
are about opportunity costs.

613
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,230
How much labor do you have
to give up to get

614
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,280
another unit of capital?

615
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,010
Or how much capital do you have
to give up to get another

616
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,760
unit of labor?

617
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,860
Now, armed with isoquants, which
are like indifference

618
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,150
curves, and these isocosts
which are like budget

619
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:16,610
constraints, we can then
figure out what is the

620
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:20,080
economically efficient
combination of inputs for the

621
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,430
firm to use.

622
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:25,900
The economically efficient
combination of inputs for a

623
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,310
given level of output.

624
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:40,450
So the economically efficient
input combination for a given

625
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:45,980
level of output is going to be
determined by the tangency of

626
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:50,420
the isoquant with the isocost,
as you see in figure 9-2.

627
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,540

628
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,600
Here we're going to use our same
isoquant we had before,

629
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,610
which is we're going to assume
that q equals square

630
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,610
root of k times l.

631
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:06,820
So same production function we
had before, which gave a

632
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,285
series of isoquants
last lecture.

633
00:30:08,285 --> 00:30:11,420

634
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:16,560
So basically, what we see
is that the efficient--

635
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:30,270
if you want to produce a given
amount of q, then basically

636
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:33,170
what you're going to do is
you're going to look for the

637
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:39,060
tangency of that isoquant with
the isocost. And you're going

638
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:42,660
to say that the efficient way to
produce that is going to be

639
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:47,090
to use 2 1/2 units of capital
and 5 units of labor.

640
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,290
It's going to say look, given
the relative prices that are

641
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:52,260
given to us by this budget
constraint, the production

642
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,860
technology is given to us by
this production function from

643
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,070
which we derived isoquants
last time.

644
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:01,320
So the optimal combination of
inputs to get this level of

645
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,830
output is going to be 2
1/2 units of capital

646
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,370
and 5 units of labor.

647
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,070
And that will produce basically

648
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,270
square root of 12 1/2.

649
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:16,400
So basically the quantity will
be equal to the square root of

650
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,910
5 times 2 1/2, or the square
root of 12 1/2 units of

651
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:24,080
production.

652
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,130
So basically, that is
going to give us the

653
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,530
efficient way to do that.

654
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,470
Now, once again as always, we
want to think about things

655
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:34,420
intuitively, graphically,
and mathematically.

656
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:38,240
Let's think about for a second
the mathematics.

657
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:47,110
We know that the slope
of the isoquant--

658
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,460
we talked last time--

659
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,325
the slope of the isoquant
at any given point.

660
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:54,070
The isoquant slope was the
marginal rate of technical

661
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,880
substitution.

662
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,990
We defined that last time.

663
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,010
The slope of the isoquant was
the marginal rate of technical

664
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:05,240
substitution which is the
marginal product of labor over

665
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,310
the marginal product
of capital.

666
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,090
And what we're saying is we want
to set that marginal rate

667
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,730
of technical substitution
equal to the input costs

668
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,764
ratio w over r.

669
00:32:14,764 --> 00:32:17,370

670
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:20,740
That's what we're saying, the
efficient thing to do is to

671
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,770
set the marginal rate of
technical substitution equal

672
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,020
to the price ratio.

673
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,870
That's what happens when
the slopes are equal.

674
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,720
Now, once again, I
find it easier to

675
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,130
rewrite this equation--

676
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,160
once you've developed the
intuition, I find it easier to

677
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,190
think of it this way.

678
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,670
Rewrite this as the marginal
product of labor over the

679
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:41,140
wage, equals the marginal
product of capital over the

680
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,450
rental rate.

681
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:46,780
What this is telling us is the
efficient place is where

682
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:51,320
essentially for every dollar you
spent on workers, you're

683
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,400
getting the same return as a
dollar spent on machines.

684
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,430
The marginal product of labor
over the wage is sort of the

685
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,630
bang for buck of workers.

686
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,500
What are you getting for your
next dollar of wage?

687
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,220

688
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,250
The marginal product of capital
over r is the bang for

689
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:06,940
the buck of machines.

690
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,650
What are you getting for your
next dollar of rent?

691
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,760
And the efficient point is
where these are equal.

692
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,020
If they're not equal, then you
have too much of one and not

693
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,270
enough of the other.

694
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,300

695
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,440
So basically, what we
can do is we can

696
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,420
solve in this example--

697
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:31,060
in this example, we could say
the marginal product of labor

698
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:35,395
is 1/2 k over the square
root of k times l.

699
00:33:35,395 --> 00:33:38,570

700
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:41,120
The marginal product of capital
from this production

701
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,820
function is--

702
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,060
once again I'm using this
production function q equals

703
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,600
square root of k times l.

704
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,580
Marginal project of capital
is 1/2 l over square

705
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,010
root of k times l.

706
00:33:55,010 --> 00:34:01,480
So the ratio of the marginal
products is simply k over l.

707
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,470
The marginal rate of technical
substitution, given this

708
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,940
production function,
is k over l.

709
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,570
That's the marginal rate of
technical substitution.

710
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:11,659
So this says that given this
production function and these

711
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:19,699
prices, at the optimum you
should set k over l equal to w

712
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:22,710
over r, which equals 1/2.

713
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:25,810
So what this says is given
this production function,

714
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,480
these price ratios, the optimal
thing to do is to use

715
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,790
half as much capital as labor.

716
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:35,429

717
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:38,070
Half as much capital as labor
is the optimal thing to do,

718
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:41,480
and that's what we see in figure
9-2, is the optimal

719
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,460
thing to do is use half as
much capital as labor.

720
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,540
Now, in other words,
let's say, to

721
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,860
now develop the intuition.

722
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,600
Imagine you told me no, I should
use as much capital as

723
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,530
I should use labor.

724
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,429
As much capital as I
should use labor.

725
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:58,000
Imagine I told you that.

726
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,130
Imagine I said no, in fact, the
efficient thing to use is

727
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:03,470
why not have one machine
for every worker?

728
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:06,740
How would you tell me
intuitively why that's wrong?

729
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,600
Why would I be wrong
to say use one

730
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,850
machine for every worker?

731
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:13,020

732
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,290
Why would that be wrong,
given the prices

733
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,540
prevailing in the market?

734
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,260

735
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,536
Someone can tell me this.

736
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:21,012
Yeah?

737
00:35:21,012 --> 00:35:24,344
AUDIENCE: Well, renting
machines is a lot more

738
00:35:24,344 --> 00:35:26,730
expensive than paying
more workers.

739
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,529
JON GRUBER: Twice as
expensive to rent a

740
00:35:28,529 --> 00:35:29,144
machine as get a worker.

741
00:35:29,144 --> 00:35:32,100
AUDIENCE: So it would be more
cost-effective to have the

742
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,030
workers share machines rather
than get a whole new machine.

743
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:38,130
JON GRUBER: The key point is
the machine costs twice as

744
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:42,360
much, but the machine doesn't
do twice as much.

745
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,360
The machine and the worker
do the same thing.

746
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,450
The marginal rate of technical
substitution is one.

747
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,550
You're indifferent between one
more machine and one more

748
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:52,900
worker, but the machine cost
twice as much as the worker.

749
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,190
So you want more workers and
fewer machines, right?

750
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,590
Given the machines and workers,
this is a perfectly

751
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,000
substitutable production
function.

752
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,700
The marginal rate of technical
substitution is k over l.

753
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,360
You're perfectly indifferent
between these two, given

754
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,690
that-- not perfectly
substitutable, but at this

755
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,550
point you're indifferent
between the two.

756
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,870
So given that you're indifferent
and the machines

757
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,680
cost twice as much, why not
buy half as many machines?

758
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,588
Yeah?

759
00:36:18,588 --> 00:36:21,150
AUDIENCE: But then, if the
machines cost twice as much,

760
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,590
why buy any machines?

761
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,520
JON GRUBER: Oh, that's
very good point.

762
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,540
Because it's not a perfectly
substitutable function.

763
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,270
My bad.

764
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:30,250
If it was, if the production
function--

765
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:30,790
great question.

766
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:34,460
Let's say the production
function was of the form q

767
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,960
equals k plus l.

768
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,370
That's perfectly substitutable
production.

769
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:41,390
Then you're right, in that
situation you should only buy

770
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,360
workers because they do exactly
the same thing.

771
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,020
But that's not the case here.

772
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,880
This exhibits diminishing
marginal product.

773
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,180
So if you only bought workers,
eventually each worker would

774
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,070
do so much less that you'd be
better off getting a machine.

775
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:55,870
It's not perfectly

776
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,986
substitutable, I misspoke before.

777
00:36:57,986 --> 00:37:02,970
At the margin they have
an equal effect.

778
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,290
But as you get more and more
laborers, they'll be less and

779
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,968
less productive, so eventually
you're going to

780
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,870
want to buy a machine.

781
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:12,310
But you're only going
to buy half as

782
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,090
many machines as workers.

783
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,690
You never want to buy one
machine per worker.

784
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,140
But you also don't want no
machines per workers, because

785
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,470
the workers won't have
anything to do then.

786
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:21,010
Here you'd want no machines
per worker, right?

787
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:24,320
The optimal thing to do,
if you have a perfectly

788
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,550
substitutable production
function, you'd only just buy

789
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,280
the cheaper input.

790
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,080
But that's not the case when you
have diminishing marginal

791
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,630
products, then you're going to
use a combination of inputs.

792
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:37,100
But the combination used will be
determined by the prices in

793
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,670
the market.

794
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:42,740
Other questions about that?

795
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:46,630
So now we can ask, just as we
asked in consumer theory, how

796
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,000
does a price change in the price
of goods affect your

797
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,750
consumption decisions, we can
ask how does a change in the

798
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,380
price of inputs affect your
production decisions?

799
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:58,100
You could see that in the
next page, figure 9-3.

800
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:02,440
Imagine that wages went up.

801
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,650
So imagine now wages, instead
of being $5 an hour,

802
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,050
are $7.50 an hour.

803
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,610
They pass a new minimum
wage, and wages go

804
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,390
up to $7.50 an hour.

805
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,730
What does that do?

806
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:21,370
Well, that steepens the isocost.
Your trade-off is now

807
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:24,060
you're going to get fewer
workers for every machine you

808
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,270
give up, or more machines for
every worker you give up.

809
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:30,820
And so at the same isoquant,
that's going to shift you to

810
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:35,000
using less labor and
more capital.

811
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,920
By the same logic as before,
you're going to use less labor

812
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:42,760
and more capital, because you're
going to see this shift

813
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,200
in relative prices.

814
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,770
This figure shows why the
minimum wage leads to

815
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:49,010
unemployment.

816
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:49,890
We talked about it last time.

817
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,430
We did in a graph, we just said
supply and demand and

818
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:52,810
showed you.

819
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:55,060
But actually this is the
underlying mechanics of how

820
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,720
minimum wage leads
to unemployment.

821
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,930
Because the minimum wage,
by change, is

822
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,160
relative input prices.

823
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,680
If the only way you could
produce things was with labor,

824
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,050
there wouldn't be much
unemployment for a minimum

825
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,390
wage because basically you
wouldn't have anything else

826
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:08,820
you could do.

827
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,160
You'd still have to
hire the workers.

828
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,460
But, in fact, that's not the
only way to produce things.

829
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,270
You can substitute to capital.

830
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:17,380
As a minimum wage goes up, firms
will substitute towards

831
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,210
capital, and that's why the
minimum wage will lead to

832
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,520
unemployment.

833
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,310
So this is sort of the
underlying mechanics of how

834
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,280
that happens.

835
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,600
All right, now armed
with that--

836
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,800
so basically when we
did consumer theory

837
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,500
we were done here.

838
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,240
We basically said, look, we
now know you have a budget

839
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,510
constraint, you have
indifference curves, you're

840
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,340
fine with their tangent,
you're done.

841
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,020
The reason firms are one step
harder is you don't have a

842
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,610
budget constraint.

843
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:50,990
q is not given to you, q is
ultimately decided by you.

844
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,680
You the firm are going to
decide on little q.

845
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,500
With our example for consumers,
your parents gave

846
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,450
you $96, you had no choice.

847
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,680
Well here the firm isn't given
little q, it's going to

848
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,870
decide little q.

849
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,690
What that means is we're
not done yet.

850
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:07,360
There's one extra step we need
to do with firms, which is

851
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,030
figure out where little
q comes from.

852
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,990
So to do that, we're going to
have to then say well, how

853
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:18,190
does a firm think about the set
of choices of little q?

854
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:21,640
And how does it think about how
it changes production as

855
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,300
little q changes?

856
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,700
So to see that, go
to figure 9-4a.

857
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:29,290

858
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:33,850
This shows the long-run
expansion path for a firm.

859
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:39,780
This shows how, as it produces
different amounts of goods, it

860
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,540
will choose different
units of inputs.

861
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,980
So for the first level of
production, it chooses five

862
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,540
machines and 10 workers.

863
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,390
Then if it wants to double
production, it chooses 10

864
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,340
machines and 20 workers.

865
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:56,570
So if it wants to increase
production by another 50%, it

866
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:59,770
chooses 15 machines and
30 workers, and so on.

867
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,250
This is a linear
expansion path.

868
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,100
This says this firm is a
production function, and

869
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:08,040
prices are such that basically
they always want these inputs

870
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,260
in fixed proportions.

871
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,450
So it would be a fixed
proportional expansion path.

872
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:14,430
No matter how much you choose to
produce, you always want to

873
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,460
use twice as much labor
as capital.

874
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,775
However, that doesn't
have to be the case.

875
00:41:18,775 --> 00:41:22,940

876
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:26,360
So this long-run expansion
path is going to be what

877
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,680
becomes our underlying
cost curve.

878
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,703
This is where underlying cost
curves are going to come from,

879
00:41:32,703 --> 00:41:34,500
and hopefully where supply is
going to come from, is this

880
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,780
long-run expansion path.

881
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,780
This long-run expansion path is
going to show us how much

882
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,010
more we have to spend
to produce

883
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,270
different amounts of quantity.

884
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,890
Now in this case, what you see
here is that you have these

885
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:44,700
fixed proportions.

886
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,300
That as you increase quantity,
that the input portion stays

887
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,920
the same, but that doesn't
have to be.

888
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,675
For instance, figure 9b, you can
imagine a world where, as

889
00:41:53,675 --> 00:41:57,230
you produce more units,
capital becomes less

890
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,275
productive.

891
00:41:58,275 --> 00:41:59,990
So you want more and
more labor, but not

892
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,220
that much more capital.

893
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,230
So this might be the example
of like McDonald's.

894
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:08,610
If McDonald's wants to produce
more burgers, ultimately

895
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,420
there's only so many fryolators
it can use.

896
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,800
Ultimately, it needs more
people to package up the

897
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,100
burgers and sell them.

898
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,920
So you might think that capital
becomes less and less

899
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,710
productive.

900
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:22,670
And as a given McDonald's
franchise expands its sales,

901
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,830
it might want to increase the
ratio of labor to capital.

902
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,610
So this is a case where
capital's becoming less

903
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:28,350
productive.

904
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:31,990
And as you see, as you expand
production you're going to

905
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,350
more labor and less capital.

906
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,460
In other words, the marginal
product of labor is still

907
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,015
steep, and the marginal
product of capital is

908
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:38,650
flattening.

909
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:42,060
So you want more
and more labor,

910
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,340
and not as much capital.

911
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,630
That's one kind of
expansion path.

912
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:49,390
Figure 9c shows a different
kind of expansion path.

913
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:51,780
Here's one where labor becomes
less productive.

914
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:57,400
So this might be, for example,
something which is a mass

915
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,890
production process, like
producing automobiles.

916
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:06,350
Where basically as you produce
more and more automobiles, you

917
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,940
need more and more machines
to produce them.

918
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,680
The people just run
the machines.

919
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,120
So it's much more efficient to
have to do it through more

920
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:16,220
machines and less through more
workers in automobile

921
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,040
production.

922
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,230
So in that case you could have
a steeper expansion path,

923
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:22,900
where basically the marginal
product of labor is falling

924
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,990
relative to the marginal product
of capital, so you

925
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:28,280
want to increase the ratio of
capital to labor over time.

926
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,440
The bottom line is as firms
produce more, they may hold

927
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,950
constant or may change the ratio
of their inputs, but

928
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:37,400
they'll clearly use
more inputs.

929
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,720
They're going to use more
inputs, but the mix of the

930
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,890
inputs they'll use will change
with their production levels.

931
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,800
So the question we have to ask
is, well, what's going to

932
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,650
determine their production
level?

933
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:48,100
Where does q come from?

934
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,330
I'll have to leave that as
a teaser for next time.

935
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:53,080
Let me just say where q comes
from, is q is going to come

936
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,750
from market competition.

937
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:56,550
We're going to get q--

938
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,250
I'm not done, I have one
more thing to cover.

939
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:01,960
But we're going to get q from
market competition.

940
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,320
Now there is one other
thing I want to cover

941
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,660
though related to costs.

942
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,880
Which is an important concept
that we have to have in the

943
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,000
back of our mind, which when we
come back, we think about

944
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,100
competition.

945
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:14,720
Which is fixed versus
sunk cost. Fixed--

946
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,070
my wife always thought I was
saying some costs, I'm not.

947
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:19,330
I'm saying sunk costs.

948
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:26,910
Fixed versus sunk costs.

949
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,340
Fixed versus sunk costs.

950
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:35,550
Sunk costs are costs which are
fixed even in the long-run.

951
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:38,840
Fixed costs are costs which are
fixed in the short-run,

952
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,440
and variable in the long-run,
so capital.

953
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,420
Sunk costs are costs which are
fixed in the long-run.

954
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:49,520
That is, they're foregone
once you produce.

955
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,880
The minute you produce one unit,
those sunk costs are

956
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,330
gone forever, and
they cannot be

957
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:57,580
changed even in the long-run.

958
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:00,540

959
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:03,350
In other words, importantly,
they cannot be changed by how

960
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:04,750
much you produce.

961
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:09,680
So in the long-run, you can
change the cost of capital by

962
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,420
building bigger or
smaller plants,

963
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,860
producing more or less.

964
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,840
But some costs cannot
be changed.

965
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,400
So what's a classic example?

966
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,920
Well, the classic example for
example would be medical

967
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,090
education, or any professional
education.

968
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:26,690
Once you've gone to med school
and done all your grueling

969
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:30,380
years of staying up all night,
you've paid those costs.

970
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,800
They're now paid for, and it
doesn't matter if you see

971
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,740
three patients the rest of your
life or three million

972
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,200
patients the rest of your life,
you've already paid

973
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,950
those costs.

974
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,680
Think of that as the capital
of a doctor's office.

975
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,410
Now when you take your office
as a doctor, if you want to

976
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:46,910
see more patients in the
short-run, they might be

977
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,230
crammed into your office, and
in the long-run you might

978
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:49,350
build a bigger office.

979
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:52,590
So in the short-run, how hard
you work is variable.

980
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:55,110
In the long-run, how big your
office is is variable-- how

981
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:57,050
many secretaries you
hire, et cetera.

982
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:59,720
But your medical school
spending is gone.

983
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,460
That's not variable in the
long-run, that's sunk.

984
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:08,050
And that's a very important
distinction is between

985
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:13,040
basically these fixed costs,
what we call fixed costs.

986
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,970
Which are costs where, like the
costs of the office and

987
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:18,120
the machinery the physician
uses, which can be changed

988
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:22,090
over a 10-year period, versus
sunk costs which once paid are

989
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:24,020
gone forever.

990
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:27,170
And the key reason, just to
give you a hint about why

991
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:31,330
these will matter, is because
when firms set up this--

992
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:36,850
we may see firms in the
market losing money.

993
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,520
You may see firms in the
market losing money.

994
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,990
In fact, in any point in time
we see lots of firms in the

995
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:41,500
market losing money.

996
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,500
You might say, why don't they
go out of business?

997
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,250
The reason they don't go out of
business is because they've

998
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,980
already pay huge sunk costs.

999
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:50,510
It's not efficient to
go out of business.

1000
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:53,410
They've already invested
a certain amount.

1001
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,680
It's not going to be efficient
to go out of business, because

1002
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,680
then they'll give up the
cost they've invested.

1003
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,170
So if you're a doctor, and
you've spent all this money on

1004
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:03,705
med school, and you're not
making money as a doctor in

1005
00:47:03,705 --> 00:47:05,020
the first couple of years.

1006
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:07,370
If you quit and go do something
else, you've just

1007
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:10,460
given up all the investment
you made in med school.

1008
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,570
So if there's any prospect that
eventually you'll make

1009
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:15,820
money, you might want to hang
on and keep being a doctor.

1010
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:17,840
So that's the difference between
a fixed cost and a

1011
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,360
sunk cost.

1012
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,590
So I'm going to come back to
that, but it's important to

1013
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:23,205
remember that distinction when
we talk about competition.

1014
00:47:23,205 --> 00:47:25,930
So let me stop there, and
we'll come back on

1015
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:26,850
Wednesday, I guess.

1016
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:27,600
Have a good three-day weekend.

1017
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,450
We'll come back on Wednesday
and we'll talk about

1018
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:30,700
competition.

1019
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,000
