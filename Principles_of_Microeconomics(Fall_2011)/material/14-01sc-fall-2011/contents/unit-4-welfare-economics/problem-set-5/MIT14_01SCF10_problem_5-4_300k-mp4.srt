GREG HUTKO: Hi, welcome
back to the 14.01

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,110
problem-solving videos.

12
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,370
Today I'm going to be working
on Fall 2010 Problem Set 5,

13
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,990
Problem Number 4.

14
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,160
And I'm only going to be working
the last few sections,

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,150
E, F, G, and H in this video.

16
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,380
But if you need help with the
earlier sections, you should

17
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,810
go ahead and should look
at PSET Number 4,

18
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,280
Problem Number 3.

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,440
And in that problem, we work
through the production

20
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,530
function, and we go through and
we find conditional supply

21
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,700
and the conditional
demand curves.

22
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,420
But this problem is going to
have us looking at aggregated

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,390
supply in a market.

24
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,050
We have to consider what
production should be occurring

25
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,650
in the market given a set number
of firms in the market.

26
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,470
And then we're going to think
about the case of perfect

27
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,120
competition where firms have
to be operating at the

28
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,010
absolute best efficiency
possible.

29
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,280
And we're going to look
at how that affects

30
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,550
the production level.

31
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,520
Part E is introduced by saying,
consider now that r

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,070
equals 4 and w equals 1.

33
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,330
And that the market demand for
coffee is given by quantity

34
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,850
demanded equals 20 minus p.

35
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,930
There are eight other companies
operating in this

36
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,730
market and all companies have
the cost structures identical

37
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,230
to Sebastian's company, the
company that we've been

38
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,340
dealing with earlier
in the problem.

39
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,370
Part E asks us, what
is the aggregate

40
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,250
supply in this market?

41
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,220
And if you look back earlier
in this problem, the other

42
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,910
piece of information that we're
going to need is we're

43
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,130
going to need this cost function
that gives all of the

44
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,980
cost in terms of the rental rate
of capital or how much it

45
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,740
cost to use each machine per
hour, the wage rate or how

46
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,990
much labor cost per hour, and q,
the quantity, that's output

47
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,920
by a specific firm.

48
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,820
Now, to find the aggregated
supply, what we're first going

49
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,290
to find is we're going to first
find the supply curve

50
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,380
for one firm within
this market.

51
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:19,500
And then we're going to set the
demand or the supply curve

52
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,530
in terms of quantity
in terms of price.

53
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,160
We're going to multiply by
eight to aggregate it.

54
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,570
And then we'll have our
aggregated supply curve.

55
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,410
But before we do that, we also
have to think of a limiting

56
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,140
case as well.

57
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,180
When we're representing the
costs for a firm, we're going

58
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,550
to represent both the marginal
cost and the average cost. The

59
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:42,650
marginal cost is the cost of
one single additional unit,

60
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,840
while the average cost tells us
all the costs including the

61
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,670
fixed costs divided by the total
that we're producing,

62
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,920
what does that look like?

63
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,830

64
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,120
If the price in a market is
below the minimum of the

65
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,370
average cost of a firm in the
market, they're not going to

66
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,520
produce in the market.

67
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,320
So if the price is below this
critical p star, since the

68
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,570
firm, even if they're producing
right at the minimum

69
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,910
of average cost, they can never
recover their cost. So a

70
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,970
firm is only going to produce
if this p where the price

71
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,150
that's being charged is above
the p star, the minimum of

72
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,880
average cost. So we're going
to find the supply curve in

73
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,720
two cases, one where the price
is above this minimum of

74
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,560
average cost. And two, we're
going to find it when the

75
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,380
price is below that minimum.

76
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,330
Let's start off by finding the
marginal cost to get our

77
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,710
supply curve.

78
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,430
Taking the marginal cost, the
derivative with respect to q.

79
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,600

80
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,460
Or before we can take the
marginal cost, sorry, let's

81
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,750
plug-in for the variables
w and r.

82
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:55,800
We're going to find that our
cost curve is given by 4 plus

83
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,450
4q squared.

84
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,190
Now we can find the marginal
cost, which will be our supply

85
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,490
curve for a single firm.

86
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:09,320

87
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,120
So in most cases, we know that
this supply curve is going to

88
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,899
represent the supply for a
single firm where marginal

89
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:20,910
cost, the price, is
going to equal 8q.

90
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:28,350
So in most cases, this will be
our supply curve for one firm.

91
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:35,770
Putting it in terms of q,
we'll have q equals p/8.

92
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:43,750
Now since we have eight firms,
we multiply by 8.

93
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,860
And in this case, we're going
to have the aggregated

94
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,750
quantity, which we represent by
a capital Q. So that's the

95
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,270
quantity produced by all eight
firms in the market.

96
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,520
And that's going
to equal price.

97
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,630

98
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,370
So this is one part of
the supply curve.

99
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,980
And what we need to know is,
what's the critical price at

100
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,890
which this will represent
the supply curve?

101
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:14,290
So when the average cost curve
crosses the marginal cost

102
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,560
curve, that's the minimum of the
average cost. It's always

103
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,920
like that for all cost curves
for a producer.

104
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,670
So if we set marginal cost equal
to average cost, we find

105
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:31,840
this critical p star at which
the firm is going to produce

106
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,230
at any price above
that p star.

107
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,860
So we're going to go back to our
marginal cost. And what we

108
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,250
have to do is we have to find
the average cost as well to

109
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,520
set it equal.

110
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,980
To get the average cost, we're
just going to go back up to

111
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,970
our cost curve and we're going
to divide through the whole

112
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,660
thing by q.

113
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,600
So the average cost is going to
be 4 divided by q plus 4q.

114
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,260

115
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,210
Now we're going to set average
cost and marginal cost equal.

116
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,300

117
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,080
And when we set marginal cost
and average cost equal to find

118
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,830
the intersection point on our
graph, what we're going to

119
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:15,520
find is we're going to find that
critical p star is going

120
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,910
to be equal to 8.

121
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:24,680
So Qs is going to equal p for
any price that's greater than

122
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,470
or equal to 8.

123
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,280
But what happens in the
case where the price

124
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,660
is less than 8?

125
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:36,980
In that case, no single firm can
make a profit by being in

126
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,070
the market.

127
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:45,590
So for any price less than 8,
the production level is going

128
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,880
to be equal to 0.

129
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,340

130
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,280
Now we're going to move
on to the next case.

131
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,760
Now we're going to take the
demand curve that we're given

132
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,550
and we're going to calculate
the equilibrium price, the

133
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,740
aggregate quantity sold, and
the quantity sold by each

134
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,270
firm, and the economic
profit of each firm.

135
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,390
So let's start off in solving
this problem, we're going to

136
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,260
just assume that the price,
the equilibrium price, is

137
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:18,310
going to be greater than
or equal to 8.

138
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,260
And as we're solving through the
problem, if we end up with

139
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,980
a price that's less than 8, then
we're just going to go

140
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,980
back and we're going to say,
OK, there's going to be no

141
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,690
production, and we're done.

142
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,600
But let's work with the
assumption that we're working

143
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,390
with this supply curve
to begin with.

144
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,290
All we have to do in this case
is we're just going to set the

145
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,410
supply curve we just found
equal to the demand curve

146
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,660
that's given in the problem.

147
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:48,040

148
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,680
Solving through for p, we're
going to find that the price

149
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,860
in this market is going
to be equal to 10.

150
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,210
And plugging in the price back
into the demand curve, you can

151
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:03,640
find that the aggregate
quantity is going

152
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,960
to be equal to 10.

153
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,270
So the price for each unit is 10
and the aggregate quantity

154
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,660
is 10 as well.

155
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,940
Now to find the quantity
produced by each of the eight

156
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,650
firms, all the firms, since
they have identical cost

157
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,630
structures, are going to be
producing the same amount.

158
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,940
So we're just going to divide
this quantity by 8 to find the

159
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:36,820
quantity produced by the
individual firms. So each firm

160
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,600
in this case produces
5/4 of a unit.

161
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,799
The last thing that we have to
do is we have to calculate the

162
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,140
economic profits for each of
the single firms. So the

163
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,910
profit is going to be equal to
the revenue, which is just

164
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:56,350
price, times the quantity
for a single firm.

165
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,580
A big mistake here would be to
use the aggregated quantity.

166
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,310
And then you're going
to subtract out the

167
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,070
cost for each firm.

168
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,030
And we're just going to use
the cost function that was

169
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:09,140
given after plugging
in w and r.

170
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:41,920

171
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,670
And this is going to represent
the economic profit for each

172
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,630
of the firms. And this leads
right into the next part of

173
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,210
the problem.

174
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,850
It asks us, can this be a long
run equilibrium where we have

175
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,490
these prices, quantities,
and profits?

176
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,850
And why or why not?

177
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,760
And how will the supply
side of the market

178
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,000
adjust in the long run?

179
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,920
Now when other firms are
considering entering the

180
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,070
market, the only thing that
they're going to consider is

181
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,020
they're going to consider, is a
firm that's existing in the

182
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,720
market currently
making profit?

183
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,860
If they're not currently making
profit, then the firm

184
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,140
that's considering entering
would have to have a better

185
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,750
technology, a better way of
producing at lower cost, to

186
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,360
enter the market and
be able to actually

187
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,140
produce with a profit.

188
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,960
But if there is profit being
made, in this case 2.25 for

189
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,350
each firm, then more and more
firms are going to enter until

190
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,000
profits are driven down to 0.

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,240
So is this a long
run equilibrium?

192
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,680
The answer is no.

193
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,700
And why not?

194
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,410
More firms are going to enter on
the supply side until we're

195
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,980
driven to equilibrium.

196
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,680
The last part that we're going
to do is we're going to do

197
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,180
part H. Part H asks us, what
is going to be the price in

198
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,280
the long run?

199
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,940
How many firms will
be present in this

200
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,450
market in the long run?

201
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,300
And how much will each
firm produce?

202
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,700
Now in the long run, we know
that profits are going to be

203
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,170
driven down to 0, and that each
firm is going to have to

204
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,250
be leaner and meaner.

205
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,110
They're going to have to produce
at maximum efficiency

206
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,160
to be competitive within
the market.

207
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,360
So if we go back to the graph
that we started with, we can

208
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,730
look at, at which point are
firms operating optimally?

209
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,400
It's when marginal cost is equal
to average cost. It's at

210
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,120
this critical p star that
we calculated to

211
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,820
be equal to 8 earlier.

212
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,220
So in the long run, all the
firms are going to have to be

213
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,090
lean and mean.

214
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,540
They're going to have to operate
at a very low average

215
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,070
cost. And we're going to
calculate how many firms are

216
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,730
going to be in the market
producing at this point where

217
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,020
marginal cost intersects
average cost.

218
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:50,600
So to start off H, we know that
p is going to be equal to

219
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,650
the minimum of average cost,
which we calculated in one of

220
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,180
the earlier parts of the problem
to be equal to 8.

221
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,740
When we have this equal to 8,
we can plug-in to our demand

222
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,330
curve that price.

223
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,810
And we can find that the
quantity demanded is going to

224
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:21,250
be equal to 12.

225
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,700
Now what we can do now is we can
go back and we can look at

226
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,370
the individual supply
curve for each firm.

227
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,120
And each firm, when we had our
individual supply curves that

228
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,470
we calculated in the first part
of the problem, had a

229
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:42,370
supply function that was equal
to q equals p divided by 8.

230
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,240
And in this case, if we know
that the price when the firms

231
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:52,070
are operating optimally is equal
to 8, then we know that

232
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,980
each firm is going
to be producing

233
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,180
one unit of the good.

234
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,630
So to find the total number of
firms, we just have to take

235
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,880
this aggregated amount, the
total amount that's being

236
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,000
produced, and divide through
by the amount each firm is

237
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,050
producing to find out the number
of firms that have to

238
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,300
be producing.

239
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:31,080

240
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,930
So in the long run, we're going
to have 12 firms each

241
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,960
producing one unit at a price
of 8, which is the optimal

242
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,170
price where marginal cost is
equal to the minimum of the

243
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,870
average cost. So just to
summarize what this problem

244
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:49,180
had us look at, we looked at the
case where we had instead

245
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,990
of just one firm, we
had multiple firms

246
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,450
operating in a market.

247
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,740
We saw that when we have
multiple firms operating that

248
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,350
if there's any economic profit
that more firms are going to

249
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,930
enter until the firms that exist
in the market are forced

250
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,420
to operate optimally with
no economic profit.

251
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,300
I hope that you found this
problem helpful.

252
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,320
And go ahead and again, you can
do the earlier parts, and

253
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,980
you can look to PSET 4
Problem Number 3 for

254
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,730
help on those problems.
