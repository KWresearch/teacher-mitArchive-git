9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,710
PROFESSOR: Today we're
going to continue

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,180
discussing firm behavior.

11
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,830
But today we're going to deviate
from our fantasy land

12
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,580
of 14.01 to come to the real
world a little bit which is to

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,840
talk a bit about whether firms
actually maximize profits.

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,190
The whole presumption of
producer theory is just as we

15
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,130
think with consumer theory,
consumers maximize utility.

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,570
Except producers maximize
profits.

17
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,190
That turns out to be an
incredibly useful shorthand

18
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,780
for lots of things.

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,470
And it will turn out to be,
as with any simplifying

20
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:05,519
assumption, largely right and
largely will help us draw a

21
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,320
lot of interesting conclusions
about firms and markets.

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,550
Nonetheless, it's clearly
not right in

23
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,110
reality for every firm.

24
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:18,240
For example, we see lots of
firms doing things which look

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,940
pretty wasteful like big
corporate jets or

26
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,760
other things like that.

27
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,780
More relevantly, huge pay for
CEOs seems pretty wasteful.

28
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,920
So, for example, on 2004 the net
income of Eli Lilly, the

29
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,800
drug manufacturer,
fell by 29%.

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,940
Yet the CEO got a 41% raise to
to $12.5 million a year.

31
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,040
Or even more so in the financial
crisis, in 2009,

32
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,285
Citigroup and Merrill each lost
more than $27 billion.

33
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:46,830
It's a pretty bad year
for the financial

34
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,390
sector, you might think.

35
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,290
And yet their CEO's pay in each
company rose by more than

36
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,650
10% to about $15 million.

37
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:59,380
So in the worst year for the
financial system since 1929,

38
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,350
the CEO pay increased in
these two companies.

39
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,610
So you might think that this
sounds kind of off.

40
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,630
How could we explain that?

41
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,789
Well, there's two possible
explanations.

42
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,990
So one explanation is that
things which look wasteful

43
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,280
really aren't.

44
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,510
That is that we pay CEOs a
huge amount of money, but

45
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,070
they're worth it.

46
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,450
So, for example, even at his
ultimate salary of $33 million

47
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,600
per year, Michael Jordan
was vastly underpaid.

48
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,920
By any reasonable economic
analysis of the value he added

49
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,410
to the Chicago Bulls, it was
well in excess of $50 million.

50
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,380
So even though he was
paid $33 million,

51
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,020
Michael Jordan was underpaid.

52
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,860
Similarly, just because someone
gets paid a lot of

53
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,830
money, doesn't mean that
they're overpaid.

54
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,840
These CEOs are very
talented people.

55
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,090
They may be underpaid.

56
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,750
Now this is an argument you
might have made with a

57
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,930
somewhat straight face maybe
10 or 15 years ago.

58
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,890
It's hard to make that with
a straight face now.

59
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,150
It's hard to believe that these
CEOs of these companies

60
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,500
aren't overpaid given their
company performance and even

61
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,340
the kind of facts we
just talked about.

62
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,150
So a better explanation for
things like excessive CEO pay

63
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,340
is something which we call
the agency problem.

64
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:13,280

65
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,520
And that's what I want to
emphasize in today's lecture.

66
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:22,000
In reality, we think of a firm
as something where there's a

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,710
guy who's an owner.

68
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,340
He hires some machines
and some workers.

69
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,110
They make stuff that he thought
of, and you produce

70
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,270
it, and some profit is made.

71
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,110
So the model we have in mind
when we talked about the firms

72
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,720
so far in this course is the
model of what we might call a

73
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,890
sole proprietorship
or a partnership.

74
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,830
It's a model where one
individual, where there's

75
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,640
basically a commonality.

76
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,370
The key thing that we've
discussed so far is a

77
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,240
commonality of interest between
the owners who own the

78
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,740
company and the control
of production.

79
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,710
So the people who earn the money
from the company also

80
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,210
control the production.

81
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,310
So when you start your start-ups
when you graduate,

82
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,370
you will start them as a sole
proprietorship or a

83
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,870
partnership where you own the
company, and you control

84
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,410
what's done.

85
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,815
You're there 18 hours a day
making sure the guys are doing

86
00:04:14,815 --> 00:04:16,570
what they're supposed to do.

87
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,110
And you're who gets the money
if they succeed or lose the

88
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,070
money if they fail.

89
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,120
And that's the model we've had
in mind as we've thought about

90
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,610
corporations or firms
so far in our class.

91
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,230
But, in fact, most production
in the US

92
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,260
doesn't happen that way.

93
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,450
Most production in the US
happens through the guise of

94
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,700
corporations.

95
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,710

96
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,790
Corporations are marked
by a separation of

97
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,600
ownership and control.

98
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,140
What defines a corporation
is a separation of

99
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,240
ownership and control.

100
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,800
The owners of corporations are
the stockholders or what we

101
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,350
call the equity holders, people
who have invested money

102
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,850
in the corporation.

103
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,930
So the owners of the corporation
are its investors,

104
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,380
its stockholders, its
equity holders.

105
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,940

106
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,460
All of you, most of you,
probably somewhere--

107
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,050
if you're Jewish, it's in some
Bar Mitzvah gift you got, if

108
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,250
you're not, it's in some other
gift you got-- probably have

109
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,570
some equity ownership in
something somewhere.

110
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,230
OK.

111
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,360
You maybe have a little bond
which says you own five shares

112
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,830
of GM that someone gave you,
because they thought it'd be

113
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,420
cute or whatever.

114
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,260
That's now worthless, but maybe
some other company.

115
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,810

116
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,590
We're equity holders.

117
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,420
We invest in companies.

118
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,110
But we don't make the
production decision.

119
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,670
The production decision is made
by the firm's managers

120
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:47,230
who are employees of the owners,
the equity holders.

121
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,910
Now these managers may
have some ownership.

122
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,430
And we'll talk about that
in a little bit.

123
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,090
But, by and large, the primary
ownership of the firm is done

124
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,370
by people who do not control
the everyday decisions of

125
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:56,990
production.

126
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,260
And it sort of makes sense
it has to be that way.

127
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,830
When a company's as big
as Microsoft, you

128
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,190
couldn't have me.

129
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,570
Somewhere, I'm sure if you add
up my various stock funds I

130
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,830
own, I own 0.000000000001%
of Microsoft.

131
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,500
It'd be crazy to have
me involved with a

132
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,800
0.000000000001% of the
decision making.

133
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,620
I don't know anything about
anything that Microsoft does.

134
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,640
It makes sense that there's a
separation of ownership and

135
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,330
control once companies
get big enough.

136
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,240
But the fact that there is a
separation of ownership and

137
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,630
control can lead to this agency
problem and can lead to

138
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,690
firms not maximizing profits.

139
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:42,220
So, basically, the point is that
managers care not just

140
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,320
about the profits they
make but also how

141
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,310
happy their life is.

142
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,220
And things which make their life
happy may be things which

143
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,530
aren't profit maximizing.

144
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,850
The managers who are in charge
of production may have their

145
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,410
own agenda that deviates from
profit maximization.

146
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,630
And the problem is it may be
hard to figure that out if

147
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,950
you're the owner of the firm.

148
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,200
So the agency problem is the
first example of a problem

149
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,090
we'll talk about later in the
semester of imperfect

150
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,680
information.

151
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,610
This is the first time we'll
see imperfect information.

152
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,160
We've assumed in our class so
far, and we'll assume in our

153
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,780
class going forward that there's
perfect information

154
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,380
the world, that everyone knows
what stuff costs, that

155
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,540
everyone can shop costlessly
across providers, et cetera.

156
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,800
But, in fact, the world
is marked by imperfect

157
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,780
information.

158
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,070
As an owner of Microsoft, as a
trivial owner of Microsoft, I

159
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,960
don't know for sure that every
Microsoft employee is doing

160
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,630
what's profit maximizing
for the company.

161
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,150
I can't.

162
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,650
It's just impossible
for me to own that.

163
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,050
So that creates an
agency problem.

164
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,340
And the agency problem arises
because it's in the employees'

165
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,970
interest, perhaps, to do things
which aren't profit

166
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,590
maximizing.

167
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,130
So so as a simple example,
imagine that you're an

168
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,120
investor in the company that's
a medium-sized company.

169
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,910
And the head of that company is
jealous because all of his

170
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,840
friends at bigger companies have
their own jets, and he's

171
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,610
got to fly commercial.

172
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:12,375
He says, I want my own jet,
because I'm not cool enough.

173
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:16,370
There's this great episode of
the Simpsons where Burns goes

174
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,940
to the billionaires club.

175
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,130
And he's in the billionaires
club.

176
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,136
And then eventually his wealth
drops so low he gets thrown

177
00:08:21,136 --> 00:08:23,020
into the millionaires club, and
it's these yokels in the

178
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,580
millionaires club.

179
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,970
He's like, I want to be back
in the billionaires club.

180
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,980
The point is managers of
companies care about how they

181
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,300
look and who they
hang out with.

182
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,090
And you've got this manager of
a medium-sized company who

183
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:33,909
wants his own private jet.

184
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,820
But he knows that that's
not profit maximizing.

185
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,460
Because he knows that if he
figures out his travel, and

186
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,905
prices it out at competitive
prices, it'll be cheaper to

187
00:08:41,905 --> 00:08:43,270
just travel commercial.

188
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:43,900
So what does he do?

189
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:48,270
He puts together a glossy
PowerPoint which he presents

190
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,060
to you, the owner of the
company, showing that

191
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,780
financially it would be more
prudent to own a jet than to

192
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,005
fly commercial.

193
00:08:56,005 --> 00:08:58,186
What he doesn't point out and
put into that PowerPoint is

194
00:08:58,186 --> 00:09:00,270
that in putting together the
commercial prices he used, he

195
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,820
chose the highest rates from
flying from point A to point

196
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,990
B, not the lowest rates.

197
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,656
Now, unless you're an expert
on the cost of flying from

198
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:08,010
point A to point B, you
won't know that.

199
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,110
You'll say, well, that's
a pretty impressive

200
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,650
presentation.

201
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,640
Yes, you can show you've saved
20% by having your own plane.

202
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,630
Go get it.

203
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,640
But it turned out he
didn't save 20%.

204
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,050
He just cooked the numbers in
a way to make his life nicer

205
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,300
even if it wasn't profit
maximizing.

206
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,170
And that's an example of the
kind of problem that arises

207
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,420
with imperfect information.

208
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,420

209
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,070
And I could go through examples
all the time.

210
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,470
But I think you guys probably
all understand what I'm

211
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,930
talking about, which is there's
lots of ways employees

212
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,290
of companies might make their
lives nicer that aren't profit

213
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,300
maximizing.

214
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,450
Now, corporations have
recognized this from time

215
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,010
immemorial.

216
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,080
And they've recognized that
their owners are too diffuse

217
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,730
to monitor this.

218
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,350
So what corporations do
is they have set up an

219
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:52,430
intermediary between the owners
and the producers

220
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,680
called the board of directors.

221
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,710

222
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,570
The board of directors is a set
of individuals appointed

223
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,320
by the owners that are supposed
to actually pay

224
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,040
attention to what's going
on in production.

225
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,470
The owners say, look, we can't
afford to pay attention.

226
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,350
But we're going to appoint you,
the board of directors,

227
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,510
and we're going to pay you
quite a lot of money.

228
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,460
A typical director on the
Fortune 500 company will make

229
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,770
$100,000 plus a year.

230
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,330
It's a part-time job.

231
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,120
We appointed you to keep
an eye on the tools of

232
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,850
production.

233
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,470
The problem is the board
of directors aren't

234
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,180
that good at it either.

235
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,880
Because it turns out to be
really hard to figure out

236
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,600
exactly what's going on.

237
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,240
And this is made worse, because
the members of the

238
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,560
board of directors are often
chosen by management of the

239
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,900
company, by the people
running the

240
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,650
production, not by the owners.

241
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,190
So they'll make selections of
who's going to be on the board

242
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:42,720
of directors.

243
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,885
And they'll pack it with
their friends who

244
00:10:43,885 --> 00:10:45,040
will be nice to them.

245
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,010
So, for example, Richard Grasso
was the CEO of the New

246
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,610
York Stock Exchange.

247
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,320
He started out in the mail
room, worked his way up.

248
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,290
He became CEO of the New York
Stock Exchange and retired

249
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:59,120
with $187 million severance
package which was outrageous

250
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,520
and totally unearned.

251
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,570
But the board of directors were
a bunch of his buddies

252
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,070
who'd known him since
he was a kid.

253
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,250
And they said, he seems
like a nice guy.

254
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,300
Let's give him a
bunch of money.

255
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,810
And a lot of the board of
directors, when actually

256
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,780
grilled on it, didn't actually
know he'd gotten that much.

257
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,200
They were like, wow.

258
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,340
We didn't realize
his retirement

259
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,860
package was that big.

260
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,610
So it turns out having the board
of directors does not

261
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,040
solve the agency problem.

262
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,710
Because there's still too much
of an information imperfection

263
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,450
between the managers and the
board of directors, not to

264
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,150
mention the managers
and the owners.

265
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,170
So what do we do?

266
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,240
What do we do with this
agency problem?

267
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,110
Well, this was known
for a lot of years.

268
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:37,120
And about 25 years ago, the
thinking was, look, the way to

269
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,780
solve this problem is we need to
align the incentives of the

270
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,365
managers and the owners.

271
00:11:43,365 --> 00:11:45,270
If we're going to solve this
problem, we need to get the

272
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,480
managers, the producers, to
actually care about maximizing

273
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,440
profits enough that they'll do
that even if it makes their

274
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,300
life a little uncomfortable.

275
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,460
And how do we do that?

276
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,190
We turn the managers
into owners.

277
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,150
We give the managers, the
producers, an ownership stake

278
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,410
in the company.

279
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:05,670
We say look, your income is
going to be directly derived

280
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,620
from the profitability
of this company.

281
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,100
So now you'll have a direct
incentive to do what's profit

282
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,470
maximizing even if it makes
your life a little

283
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,500
uncomfortable.

284
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,596
Even if it means flying
commercial, you recognize if I

285
00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:19,530
have my own jet, then
I'm going to suffer.

286
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,050
So you align the incentives.

287
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,540
So we want to give
them an ownership

288
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,270
stake in the company.

289
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,820
Well, how do you do that?

290
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,360
How do you give managers
an ownership stake?

291
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,110
Well, there's two ways
you can do it.

292
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:31,460
One way is you can directly
give them stock.

293
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,840
So you can directly say, look,
instead of paying you in cash,

294
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,630
we are going to pay you
in company stock.

295
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:42,940
So your fortunes will directly
be tied to the performance of

296
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,180
this company if you
pay them in stock.

297
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,730
Or, alternatively, you can do
something which turns out to

298
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,790
be cheaper.

299
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,200
You can give them
stock options.

300
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,940
It turns out to be cheaper,
at least, in principle.

301
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,540
We can give them
stock options.

302
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,350
So let's talk about what
a stock option is.

303
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,840
And some of you may deal with
these along the way.

304
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,260

305
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,210
A stock is a piece of paper
which says you only 0.00001%

306
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,660
of the company.

307
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,730
A stock option is simply a piece
of paper which says we

308
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,610
are granting you the right to
buy the stock at some price.

309
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,180
Typically, it's today's price.

310
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,550
We're not giving you a
share of the company.

311
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,270
You have a piece of paper which
says if the value of

312
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,900
stock today is $100, you have a
piece of paper which says no

313
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,400
matter where the stock
ends up, you can

314
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,540
always buy it for $100.

315
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,860
Why is that valuable?

316
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,020
Well, that's valuable because
let's say you give a CEO of a

317
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,630
company a million options at
$100 each when the price of

318
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,240
the stock is $100.

319
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,690
Well, if the price of the stock
rises to $150, that CEO

320
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,290
can then take his million
options, say, I want to buy

321
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,400
the shares for 100, which I'm
allowed to by these pieces of

322
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,800
paper, and I'll turn around
and sell them for $150.

323
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,250
I've just made $50 million.

324
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,110
So a stock option is valuable
if the stock goes up.

325
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,180
But it's worthless if
the stock goes down.

326
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,980
So it's kind of the ultimate
incentive, if

327
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,440
you think about it.

328
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,890
Because what it says to the CEO
is, look, we're going to

329
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,240
incent you to do better.

330
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,190
And you make a lot of money
by doing better.

331
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,860
But if you do worse, you're
not going to get anything.

332
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,200
And as myself as the owner
it seems great,

333
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,380
because it's cheaper.

334
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,850
Because if the stock goes up,
I share some with the guy.

335
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:17,500
But I don't care.

336
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:17,860
I'm happy.

337
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,850
The stock goes up.

338
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,880
If it goes down, I don't have
to give him anything.

339
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,940
And, in fact, giving someone
a stock option costs,

340
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,060
effectively, about half as much
as giving them stock.

341
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,350
So if I say today's stock price,
if I instead of giving

342
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,170
you a share of stock, I give you
an option to buy a share

343
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,520
of stock at today's price, the
value to that, what it costs

344
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,930
me in the market is about half
of what it costs when I

345
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,670
actually give you the
share of stock.

346
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,210
So it seems like
the best deal.

347
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,700
You get all the incentives for
them to raise the price, but

348
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,240
it costs you half as much.

349
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,330
And, in fact, there's been
tremendous growth in use of

350
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,890
stock and stock options.

351
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:55,810
So if you look at Figure 12-1,
now, this sort of changes.

352
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,610
Before 1992, there's only
two categories.

353
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,250
And after '92, there's three.

354
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:06,750
So before '92, we just have to
divide into salary and bonus

355
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,170
versus options.

356
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,970
So you see there was essentially
no options in '84.

357
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,690
This is the mean CEO pay.

358
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,970
So the typical CEO in 1984 made
$500,000, and it was all

359
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,220
cash, all salary and bonus.

360
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,585
By 1992, they made about $1
million, and a decent share of

361
00:15:23,585 --> 00:15:25,520
it started to be
stock options.

362
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,000
Now, starting after '92, we
actually break into three

363
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,070
categories which is salary,
bonus, and options.

364
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,380
But that doesn't
really matter.

365
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,560
The main thing is to pay
attention to the option share,

366
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,590
which you see grew
astronomically.

367
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:41,000
And so by its peak, in about
2002, first of all, the

368
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,070
typical CEO was making
$3.5 million.

369
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,620

370
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,360
Second of all, the majority of
that was in stock options.

371
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,840
In fact, if you look at salary
and bonus, it didn't grow that

372
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,370
much over time.

373
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,660
If you look at 1992 versus 2002,
over that decade, salary

374
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,650
and bonus barely grew, but
options went through the roof.

375
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,660
So there's a huge increase
in use of these.

376
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,910
And the motivation is pretty
basic economic intuition.

377
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,420
What we're going to do is this
is a cheap way to align the

378
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,665
incentives of owners
and managers.

379
00:16:16,665 --> 00:16:19,490

380
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,790
And that was why
they took off.

381
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,880
And everyone thought
it was great.

382
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,800
And people like Michael Jensen
at Harvard Business School

383
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,890
made fortunes off having
suggested this, et cetera.

384
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,460
It was like we solved
the problem.

385
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:31,620
And, remember, we did pretty
damn well in the 1990s.

386
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,380
And a lot of it, people
attributed it to exactly

387
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,500
what's in this graph.

388
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,940
That by finally figuring out how
to align the incentives of

389
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,980
producers and owners, we'd
figured out a way to change

390
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,820
the economy.

391
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,540
And people thought we sort of
entered this new economic era

392
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,070
of massive productivity.

393
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,390
Well people, as we know
now, were wrong.

394
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,630
Things slowed down in the
2000s and then now have

395
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,020
completely crashed.

396
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,100
And why were they wrong?

397
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,270
Well, they're wrong because what
makes economics fun is

398
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,310
unintended consequences.

399
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:07,430
And these stock options had
two kinds of unintended

400
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,569
consequences.

401
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:12,869
The first unintended consequence
is that they lead

402
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,119
to excessive gambling.

403
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:25,200

404
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,660
And what I mean by that is that
once your stock option is

405
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,220
out of the money, once, if
you've got it for 100,

406
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,390
you're below 100.

407
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,740
You don't care how
low it goes.

408
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,020
If you're at 99 or 20,
you don't care.

409
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,630
All we care about is being
100 verses above.

410
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:45,410
What that means is as an owner,
as a manager, you'll

411
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:48,890
take excessive risks to go into
the positive territory.

412
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,600
Even if there's a huge
risk you'll get

413
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,850
nailed on the downside.

414
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,500

415
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,170
Contrast to guys working
for a company that's

416
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,616
currently worth $100.

417
00:18:01,616 --> 00:18:09,530
One is given stock, and one is
given stock options at $100.

418
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,060
Imagine they're both going to
leave the company in one year.

419
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,910
Because there's dynamics with
the long run issues.

420
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,880
Let's put that aside.

421
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,580
They're both going to
leave in one year.

422
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,720
One today is given a share of
stock, and one today is given

423
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,810
an option to buy at $100.

424
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,090
And then they're given the
choice of a risky investment.

425
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,130
Someone comes to them
and says, have I

426
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,880
got a deal for you.

427
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,140
I've got an investment that
has a 10% chance it will

428
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,860
double the value of your company
and a 90% chance the

429
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,060
value of your company
will fall by 20%.

430
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:51,040
So there's a 10% chance of a
100% return and a 90% chance

431
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,510
of a 20% decline in your
company's value.

432
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,910
Now, what is the profit
maximizing thing

433
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,190
to do in this situation?

434
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,800
Well, to do that, we have to
consider the concept of what

435
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,375
delivers the company the
highest expected value.

436
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,730

437
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,850
Expected value is a concept
we'll use-- and we'll come

438
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,910
back to this later when we
talk about uncertainty--

439
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,770
it's a concept we use to measure
how you value things

440
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,130
when there's uncertainty.

441
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,980
So the expected value of a
gamble is the probability that

442
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:27,470
you win times the value if you
win plus the probability that

443
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:32,320
you lose times the value
if you lose.

444
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,570
That's the expected
value of a gamble.

445
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,210
And the profit maximizing thing
to do would be to take

446
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,200
gambles of expected values
of greater than zero.

447
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,460
The expected value is
the summation of the

448
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,480
value of that gamble.

449
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:54,170
This gamble has an expected
value of 0.1 times 100--

450
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,650
100% return and a 10% chance--

451
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,590
plus 0.9 times negative 20--

452
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:06,790
a 90% of losing 20-- or an
expected value of minus 8%.

453
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,060
That is if you take this gamble,
and you took it an

454
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,450
infinite number of times,
you would end up

455
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,110
losing 8% on average.

456
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,710
Any one time might work out.

457
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,340
But by the law of large numbers,
if we took this

458
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,530
enough times, you'd lose
8% on average.

459
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,800
So you will lower the value
of your company.

460
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,840
You will reduce profits
by taking this gamble.

461
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,300
Your company is worse off
if you take this gamble.

462
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,810
Well, what would the person who
got the $100 in stocks do?

463
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,640
They won't take the gamble.

464
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,310
Because their $100 in stock will
be worth, on average, 8%

465
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,390
less if they take this gamble.

466
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,590
So I'm not taking the gamble.

467
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,000
This is stupid.

468
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,210
But now let's look at the
guy who got the option.

469
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,830
His gamble is a little
bit different.

470
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,496
Because he doesn't care whether
the value of the

471
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,410
company is 99 or 80.

472
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,370
He just cares about how much
it goes above 100.

473
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,400
So what is his calculation?

474
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,600
Well, his calculation is he
has a 10% chance of making

475
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,910
100% and a 90% chance of what?

476
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,880
Zero, ending up with zero.

477
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,030
He can't lose.

478
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,740
He has a 90% chance of zero.

479
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,350
So what is his calculation?

480
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:16,250
Well, he uses the positive
10% gamble.

481
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,135
He makes money on this gamble,
because head he wins, tails he

482
00:21:20,135 --> 00:21:21,590
walks away.

483
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,550
The guy who owns the stock loses
if it's tails with this

484
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:28,550
weighted coin that only hits
heads 10% of the time.

485
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,260
This guy only wins.

486
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,250
So he says, sure.

487
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,330
Any gamble which has a huge
upside, I'm going to take.

488
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:38,500
Because I get all the upside,
and I don't bear the downside.

489
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,070
So what this does is it leads
to excessive gambling,

490
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,990
excessive risk taking.

491
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,910
And that's exactly what we saw
in economy, was companies

492
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,820
gambling on things which sounded
very good, managers

493
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,970
gambling on things which sounded
very good, some of

494
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,890
which worked out very well
and some of which didn't.

495
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,660
And that's the first problem
we have with the

496
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,300
use of stock options.

497
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,690
And questions about that?

498
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:01,900
Yeah.

499
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,876
AUDIENCE: What about using a
package of options like a

500
00:22:04,876 --> 00:22:07,356
number of stock options
[INAUDIBLE PHRASE]

501
00:22:07,356 --> 00:22:10,332

502
00:22:10,332 --> 00:22:13,320
package of stock options
[INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

503
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,290
PROFESSOR: Certainly there are
more sophisticated ways you

504
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,260
can do that.

505
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,710
I mean, there's certainly
more sophisticated

506
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,600
ways you can do that.

507
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,180
But that's a great segue to the
second problem with these.

508
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,500
The second problem is who
decided the structure of the

509
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,950
stock options?

510
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,600
The managers.

511
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,060
So the managers had executive
compensation committees that

512
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,830
designed the stock options
the managers got.

513
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,360
So the second problem
was there was

514
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,460
just outright cheating.

515
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,670
So what you just described would
be a great structure

516
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,700
which would incentivize them
maximally, but it would not

517
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,470
make them the most money.

518
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,690
So the second problem we had
was outright cheating.

519
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,470
So there's a wonderful
investigation by the Wall

520
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,850
Street Journal that investigated
a whole list of

521
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,540
stock option arrangements.

522
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,470
And what they found was
companies would frequently do

523
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,140
what's called backdating
stock options.

524
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,363
What they'd say is, look, the
value of the company just went

525
00:23:01,363 --> 00:23:04,570
up from $100 to $15 last week.

526
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,240
We're going to give you
an option at $100.

527
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,990
And let's pretend it was issued
before the company

528
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,980
value went up.

529
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,400
We've just given you money.

530
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,360
You haven't done anything
to earn that.

531
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,700
We've just given you money.

532
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,480
And the Wall Street Journal
found incredible evidence of

533
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,040
backdating stock options.

534
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,910
So they had one CEO.

535
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:25,886
They Yeah, I'm sorry.

536
00:23:25,886 --> 00:23:28,251
AUDIENCE: Is the company
paying the money?

537
00:23:28,251 --> 00:23:30,150
I thought it was like the
market who gives it.

538
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:34,840
PROFESSOR: The owners are paying
the money, the owners.

539
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,560
AUDIENCE: People who are
buying the stock are

540
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,910
exercising the option to.

541
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:38,230
PROFESSOR: No.

542
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,270
But here's the thing.

543
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,460
When I gave it to you, then,
basically, I gave you

544
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,260
something of value.

545
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,050
I have to pay for that
thing of value.

546
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,010
Now, ultimately,
the transaction

547
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,250
happens in the market.

548
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,600
But, basically, in other words,
I give you this option

549
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,390
to buy the stock at $100.

550
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,840
This is an important point that
I wasn't clear enough on.

551
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,230
I give you an option to
buy a stock at $100.

552
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,750
The stock is now worth $150.

553
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:02,440
That means that stock I could
have had at $150 as an owner.

554
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:02,830
And it's worth $150.

555
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:08,530
But by letting you take it at
$100, I let you keep the extra

556
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,810
$50 instead of me getting it.

557
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,620
I have a share of stock
which [INAUDIBLE]

558
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,000
$150.

559
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,290
I've given that to you.

560
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,248
I've, essentially, transferred
to you $150.

561
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,638
AUDIENCE: So when companies
[INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

562
00:24:23,638 --> 00:24:28,900

563
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,700
PROFESSOR: They'll keep
some amount of shares.

564
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,910

565
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,450
The owners, they
will sell stock

566
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,430
and they'll do offerings.

567
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,070
But the owners own the majority
of the stock.

568
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,450
That's what makes
them the owners.

569
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,250
Maybe that's the right
way to put it.

570
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

571
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,310

572
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,530
PROFESSOR: No.

573
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:52,810
Well, in principle, the board
of directors approves stock.

574
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,510
They don't decide.

575
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,520
An executive management
committee decides.

576
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,240
The executive management
committee consists of all the

577
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,162
golf buddies of the CEO.

578
00:24:59,162 --> 00:25:00,090
They decide.

579
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,770
The board of directors is
supposed to make sure nothing

580
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,055
untoward happens.

581
00:25:03,055 --> 00:25:05,720
The board of directors, they're
just a bunch of

582
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,390
retired former executives
who are also golf

583
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,030
buddies of the manager.

584
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,580
So they don't really
get it right.

585
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,820
So there's outright cheating.

586
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:17,310
So, for instance, one CEO,
he got six stock options.

587
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:21,870
Each one happened to be issued,
happened to be issued

588
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,040
the day before-- at least on
paper-- was issued the day

589
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,900
before a huge increase
in the stock price.

590
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,655
Now, the CEO said he
was just lucky.

591
00:25:28,655 --> 00:25:31,030
But the Wall Street Journal
did a simulation and

592
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,080
calculated that there's a 1 in
1 billion chance he could've

593
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,400
been that lucky.

594
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,350
That, in fact, what clearly
happened was he got the stock

595
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,040
options later, and they were
backdated to make it seem like

596
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,980
he got them before the
price went up.

597
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,610
But that's not the
best example.

598
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,990
The best example
is Cablevision.

599
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,670
They granted and backdated
options to their vice chairman

600
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,080
from 1997 to 2002.

601
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,010
So from 1997 to 2002, they gave
them options and they

602
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,780
kept backdating them to
make them look good.

603
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:58,870
The only problem was that
he died in 1999.

604
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,380
So, basically, they were just
giving money away to this

605
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,000
guy's heirs.

606
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,350
Clearly they weren't
incentivizing his performance.

607
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,400
As the quote said, trying to
incentivize a corpse suggests

608
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,650
they were not complying with
the spirit of shareholder

609
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,840
approved stock option plans.

610
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,740
They were just giving money to
his heirs, because they felt

611
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,760
bad for him, because they
weren't keeping their yacht up

612
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,360
or whatever.

613
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,520
So, basically, this is an
example of a kind of cheating.

614
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,850
Of course, then you can
go further, and

615
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:24,030
there's outright fraud.

616
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,810
The backdating is sort
of cheating.

617
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:26,750
You can go even further.

618
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,860
I don't know what determines
fraud versus cheating.

619
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,050
You can just do what
Enron did.

620
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,040
What Enron did is the executives
there just lied

621
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,590
about how much money
they were making.

622
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,100
They just went public with
figures that were wrong.

623
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,710
The stock price went up.

624
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:44,480
They cashed in their
options and quit.

625
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,410
And as long as you don't get
caught, that's a great deal.

626
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:50,580
And if you do get caught, well,
they fine you for 1/3 of

627
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,640
what you made.

628
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,080
So who cares?

629
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,950
So basically it was
outright fraud.

630
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,630
And this was a lot
of what happened.

631
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,280
A lot of the wealth that we
thought was created in the

632
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,200
1990s in the stock market was
really just false wealth

633
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,160
created by people saying their
company's were worth more than

634
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,190
they actually were.

635
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,006
Yeah.

636
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:07,386
AUDIENCE: Who decides the salary
[INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

637
00:27:07,386 --> 00:27:12,370

638
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,690
PROFESSOR: No.

639
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:16,010
I mean, once again, it varies
by company to company.

640
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:19,260
But, basically, the dividend
payout would be something that

641
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,110
a different set of managers
would decide, once again,

642
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,410
subject to approval
of the owners.

643
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:27,710
But, once again, the point is
that the owners of a company,

644
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,880
of a big company, are just a
diffuse set of people who

645
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,570
don't know what they're doing.

646
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,790
The managers know exactly
what they're doing.

647
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,580
The board of directors is in
between and is half clueless,

648
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,960
half knows what it's doing.

649
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,390
And that's what leads to
the agency problem.

650
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,920
What's so interesting about
this example is it sort of

651
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,160
points out, like in many things
in economics, why we're

652
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,630
called the dismal science.

653
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:52,070
There is no right answer here.

654
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,340
On the one hand, if you don't
incentivize your owners, then

655
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,500
they might not do what's
profit maximizing.

656
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,000
On the other hand, if they
incentivize your owners, they

657
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,735
might do cheating to maximize
their profits as opposed to

658
00:28:02,735 --> 00:28:03,640
the company's profits.

659
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,390
And that's why you need
complicated structures, the

660
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,050
type that was suggested
in the back.

661
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,480
And that's why, for example,
they find that companies with

662
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,760
much more concentrated
ownership, the ones that

663
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,795
Warren Buffett owns 20% of, they
do a much better job in

664
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:17,110
their CEO compensation than
the ones where it's just a

665
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,480
bunch of people owning
a tiny, tiny percent.

666
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,460
So that's exactly the kind of
difficulty you face in setting

667
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,380
up executive compensation.

668
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,610
Now, this was a real departure
from the kind of things we

669
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,830
talked about, just
one example.

670
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,410
Partly what we want to do in
this course, I want to teach

671
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,300
you about basic economics.

672
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,450
I partly want to excite you
about what else you can go on

673
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,390
and do in economics.

674
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,820
What I've just done in the last
half hour is a microcosm

675
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,320
of the field of corporate
finance.

676
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,350
There's an entire field
in economics

677
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,100
called corporate finance.

678
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,890
We teach it in course 15.

679
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:48,950
And it's a terrific course.

680
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,690
15.401 and 15.402 are the
introductory courses.

681
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,670
And if you find this stuff
exciting, as I'm sensing some

682
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,930
of you are, that's a great
place to take what we're

683
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,110
learning in this course and go
on and actually dive in.

684
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,540
Realize that half the stuff
I've told you, I'm

685
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,300
talking out of my ass.

686
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,410
I don't really know for sure.

687
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,880
But those guys do
in course 15.

688
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,830
And you can really get into
these agency relationships and

689
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,100
understand our corporations work
and how you set up these

690
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,925
kinds of compensation
arrangements.

691
00:29:11,925 --> 00:29:14,970
So this is kind of just
a very exciting area.

692
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,460
Now, we're going to go back
after this and assume

693
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,390
corporations maximize
profits again.

694
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,200
And, once again, as with any
assumption we make, by and

695
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,910
large, it's right.

696
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:25,200
And by and large it will deliver
the kind of important

697
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,280
knowledge that we need to know
about how firms function.

698
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,710
But it's important to remember
that these kinds of

699
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,470
things are behind it.

700
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:32,110
What we do in this course
is teach you the basics.

701
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,540
Then you go on in these other
electives and actually learn

702
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,830
about this kind of more
interesting tweaks

703
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,930
and what we do here.

704
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:41,590
And other questions about
this before I move on?

705
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,250
OK.

706
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:46,840
Now we're going to stop with
that topic, and we're going to

707
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,380
move to sort of an
in between topic.

708
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,760
That is, we've been talking
about firms and firm profit

709
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,870
maximization.

710
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,660
And we talked about how that
depends on the structure of

711
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,030
the market and perfect
competition.

712
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:03,370
Starting in two lectures, we're
going to start talking

713
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,170
about alternative market
structures like

714
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,240
monopoly and oligopoly.

715
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,550
But in order to talk about them,
we need to introduce a

716
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,670
new concept we haven't
used before.

717
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,560
And that's what we'll
do the rest of this

718
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,010
lecture and next lecture.

719
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:19,490
We need to move from positive
economics to normative

720
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:27,080
economics, from positive
economics to normative.

721
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,670

722
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:35,540
Positive analysis is the study
of the way things are.

723
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,990
So positive analysis is
explaining why do firms

724
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,360
produce this many widgets?

725
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,080
Why do they hire this
many workers?

726
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,170
Why did I buy this many CDs?

727
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,050
That's a positive analysis,
trying to explain the way

728
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,570
things are.

729
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:49,150
That's what we've done,
by and large, so far.

730
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:52,130
Normative analysis is the
analysis of the way

731
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,100
things should be.

732
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,380
Is it good that I bought
that many CDs?

733
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,690
Is it good that the company
made that much profits?

734
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,430
Would be better if we have a
minimum wage or don't have a

735
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,250
minimum wage?

736
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,110
Normative analysis is the
analysis of the way things

737
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,690
should be as opposed to
the way they are.

738
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:12,780
So, for example, we showed in
the last lecture that in the

739
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,910
long run, with free entry and
exit, all firms are driven to

740
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:20,250
zero profit, and the supply
curve is horizontal.

741
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,860
Well, is that a good thing?

742
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,300
We don't know.

743
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,520
We just said it happened.

744
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,565
I described why it happened.

745
00:31:25,565 --> 00:31:26,230
But I didn't tell you
if it was a good

746
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,710
thing or a bad thing.

747
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,360
Zero profits, I make a lot of
money off the profits that the

748
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,800
companies I own make.

749
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,500
I don't know if I want to
work with zero profits.

750
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,910
I've got a lot of
stock and stuff.

751
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:39,010
And I'm making money because
these companies make profits.

752
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:39,975
I don't think I'd
be that happy to

753
00:31:39,975 --> 00:31:41,000
work with zero profits.

754
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,110
How do we think about whether
that's a good

755
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,550
world or a bad world?

756
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:46,240
How do we think about whether
we like these outcomes or

757
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,500
don't like them?

758
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,635
These are the tools of normative
economics or what we

759
00:31:51,635 --> 00:31:54,280
will refer to as welfare
economics.

760
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,150

761
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,010
Now, let me be clear here.

762
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,330
The term welfare, as you might
have heard it, often refers to

763
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,040
money you give to low
income populations.

764
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,250
And we'll talk about that
kind of welfare

765
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,700
later in the semester.

766
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,020
Here, when I say welfare,
I mean well-being.

767
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,350
Welfare is the term economists
use as the measure of

768
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,080
well-being.

769
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,330
We need to start talking about
welfare economics, measuring

770
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:19,170
the impact of economic outcomes
on well-being, not

771
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,540
just studying what happens when
firms maximize profits or

772
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,180
consumers maximize utility,
but measuring how we feel

773
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:30,760
about it, measuring whether
it's good or bad, and

774
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,460
measuring whether some
outcomes might be

775
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,240
preferred to others.

776
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,190
Because if we don't do that, we
can't ever talk about the

777
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,380
role of the government
in the economy.

778
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,480
Until you start talking about
welfare, you can't talk about

779
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,330
whether we should
have government

780
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,310
interventions or not.

781
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,960
You can only talk about
what happens, not

782
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,160
whether it should happen.

783
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,210
Now, the problem of welfare
economics is that it's a lot

784
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,670
harder because of something
I mentioned when we

785
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,550
talked about utility.

786
00:32:55,550 --> 00:33:00,200
Utility is an ordinal concept,
not a cardinal concept.

787
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,950
Utility is an ordinal concept,
not a cardinal concept.

788
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,660
That is, utils are
meaningless.

789
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,970
We use utility functions to
decide whether you prefer

790
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:09,830
package A or package B. But the
actual amount of utils you

791
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:14,100
get, unlike profits, is sort
of a meaningless concept.

792
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,060
It's just sort of an index.

793
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,500
So what we do to do welfare
economics is we turn from

794
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,920
utils to dollars.

795
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,810
We measure welfare in dollars
which is easy on

796
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,050
the corporate side.

797
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,520
That's profits.

798
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,650
How do we do it on the
consumer side?

799
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,730
We do it through the concept
that we call compensating

800
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:38,310
variation, which is one of these
things where economists

801
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,380
use fancy terms for something
which isn't that hard to

802
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,530
understand.

803
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,210
But you need to know the fancy
terms, because that's kind of

804
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,700
how we teach, compensating
variation.

805
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:53,510
That is instead of asking, how
sad are you about outcome x,

806
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:56,325
we ask, how many dollars
would it take?

807
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:59,110

808
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:03,590
Instead of asking, how sad would
you be to not have a CD,

809
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:06,680
we ask, how much would
you pay to avoid

810
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,930
being in that situation?

811
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:10,120

812
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:16,920
So instead of asking, how sad
are you that you end up with

813
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,639
this car instead of that car,
we don't want to measure the

814
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,980
utils of driving a Hyundai
versus a Lexus.

815
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,960
We can't measure those.

816
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,810
What we can ask, is how much
more will you pay to get the

817
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:29,730
Lexus than the Hyundai?

818
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:33,030
And that's $1 measure
of your utils.

819
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,260
That's a compensating
variation.

820
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:38,010
How much do you have
to be compensated?

821
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:41,719
So, in other words, instead of
asking you how sad are you

822
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:44,280
that you couldn't get tickets
to a Lady Gaga concert--

823
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,159
maybe that's not a good example
because no one's sad

824
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:46,580
about that.

825
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,630
But let's say you were.

826
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,560
Let's say I am because my
daughter wants to see her.

827
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,650
How sad are you?

828
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:56,050
I ask, instead, how much would
you pay to get the tickets to

829
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,300
the Lady Gaga concert?

830
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,630

831
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,140
That's a measure of how
sad you were you

832
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,310
couldn't get them.

833
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:05,490
Because you'll pay an amount to
compensate yourself for the

834
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,040
sadness of not getting them.

835
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,340
So it's a way of turning
utils into dollars.

836
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,750
And that leads to the concept
that we'll refer to throughout

837
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,000
the semester.

838
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,760

839
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,370
That leads to the concept
of consumer surplus.

840
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:24,890

841
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:30,620
Consumer surplus measures the
benefit that a consumer gets

842
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,740
from consuming a good above
and beyond what they

843
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,250
paid for the good.

844
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:50,110
So it's the benefit of
consumption beyond the price.

845
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,770
So your consumer surplus--

846
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,480
surplus means extra--

847
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,400
is how much you enjoy consuming
something above and

848
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,210
beyond what you had
to pay for it.

849
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:04,450
In other words, the idea is if
you have to pay exactly as

850
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:07,390
much as you'd enjoy the good,
there's no consumer surplus.

851
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,930
So let's do an example.

852
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:13,490
So consider my demand to
buy a Lady Gaga CD.

853
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:14,330
I've got to update
my examples.

854
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,400
You guys don't buy
CDs anymore.

855
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,680
How many of you have bought
a CD in the last year?

856
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,822
Wow.

857
00:36:20,822 --> 00:36:21,950
OK, let me ask another
question,

858
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:22,380
just one for the record.

859
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,980
Just because I have to decide
how hard a time to give my

860
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,090
16-year-old son.

861
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:29,283
How many of you typically
pay when you buy a song?

862
00:36:29,283 --> 00:36:30,610
Wow.

863
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:30,770
OK.

864
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:31,200
Let me ask another one.

865
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,790
How many of you typically don't
pay when you buy a song.

866
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,730
Well, when you get a song, when
you download a song, you

867
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,090
know what I mean, when
you download a song.

868
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,950
So the majority of you don't pay
when you download a song.

869
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:41,360
Interesting.

870
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,610
OK.

871
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,900

872
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,160
I'll update this next year.

873
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,440
But, for now, we're still
10 years ago.

874
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,810
Consider my demand for
Lady Gaga CDs.

875
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:53,310
I'm trying to decide whether
to buy the marginal CD.

876
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:58,380
And let's say that it's
worth $15 to me.

877
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,980
I'd be willing to pay $15
for the Lady Gaga CD.

878
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,890
And let's say the
price is $15.

879
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:07,850
In that case, there's
no surplus to me.

880
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,980
There's nothing extra.

881
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,005
I've paid what I was
willing to pay.

882
00:37:11,005 --> 00:37:14,000
So that's a case of a zero
consumer surplus.

883
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,940
The consumer surplus is how
much extra I got from

884
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,330
consuming it.

885
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,085
I've got no extra.

886
00:37:18,085 --> 00:37:19,460
It was worth $15.

887
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,850
I paid $15, no surplus.

888
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:27,730
Now let's say that the
price was $10.

889
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,130
Then I've got a surplus.

890
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,340
I've got $5 in surplus.

891
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,050
I was willing to pay $15.

892
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:36,410
It makes me $15 happier to
have this Lady Gaga CD.

893
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,170
But I only had to
pay $10 for it.

894
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,930
So I've derived some surplus.

895
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,670
Well, how do we know what
people's willingness to pay

896
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:46,680
for a good is?

897
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,320
The demand curve.

898
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,300
That's the definition
of the demand curve.

899
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,470
The demand curve measures
your willingness to pay.

900
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,530
So let's go to the
second figure.

901
00:37:55,530 --> 00:38:00,300
Think about the demand
curve for CDs.

902
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,740
There's some demand
curve for CDs.

903
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:07,880
What this measures is the
utility maximizing choice.

904
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,030
Every point in this demand curve
represents my utility

905
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:15,240
maximizing choice
at that price.

906
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,980

907
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:22,000
This is backwards.

908
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,830
That should be a $15 on the
y-axis and a $5 on the x-axis,

909
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:25,290
Sorry, guys.

910
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:29,130
It should be $15 on
the y-axis and a--

911
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:29,430
no.

912
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,030
Wait, hold on one second.

913
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,280
Time out.

914
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,190

915
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,910
At $5, I get no consumer
surplus.

916
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:45,072

917
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,580
Yeah, this graph is
kind of messed up.

918
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,830
Let me draw a new one here.

919
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:51,000

920
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,270
So you've got my demand
curve for CDs.

921
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,535
You've got the quantity
and the price.

922
00:38:54,535 --> 00:38:57,910

923
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:04,390
And I've got some utility
function that delivers this

924
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,580
demand curve.

925
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,210
And let's say the way this
works, this demand curve for

926
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:12,290
CDs, let's say the way this
works is that I am

927
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:16,280
willing to buy 1 CD.

928
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:21,500
I'm willing to buy if the
price is $20, I'm

929
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,160
willing to buy 1 CD.

930
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,200
So at a price of $20, I'm
willing to buy 1 CD.

931
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,290
So if I get that 1 CD at $20,
then basically that's my

932
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,540
willingness to pay.

933
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,020
It equals a price, so there's
no consumer surplus.

934
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,180
Really imagine it's right
next to that y-axis.

935
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:47,280

936
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,740
Now let's the price
falls to $15.

937
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,040
Sorry.

938
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,100
That's a 1.

939
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,510
That's the 1.

940
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,225
That's a 20.

941
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:57,340
At a price of $20, I'm
willing to buy 1.

942
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,290
At a price of $15, I'm
willing to buy 5.

943
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,540
I'm willing to buy 5 CDs.

944
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,440

945
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,680
Now, what is my consumer
surplus?

946
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,030
Well, let's ask.

947
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:12,290
For the first CD, I got
no consumer surplus.

948
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:17,410
But for the second, I
was willing to pay.

949
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,120
When the price was $20, I
got no consumer surplus.

950
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,270
Now let's say the
price is $15.

951
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:24,840
So what was I willing to
pay for the first CD?

952
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,460
$20.

953
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,363
So what's my consumer surplus
on the first CD?

954
00:40:27,363 --> 00:40:28,670
5.

955
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:32,150
So on that first CD, I got
a consumer surplus of 5.

956
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:35,780
The second CD, I was willing to
pay less because I've got

957
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,160
diminishing marginal utility.

958
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,190
But I was still willing
to pay more than $15.

959
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,170
So I've got some
surplus there.

960
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:43,790
Third CD here, et cetera.

961
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:47,870
But on the fifth CD, I derive
no surplus, because I was

962
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:51,535
willing to pay $15 for that
fifth CD, and I paid $15 for

963
00:40:51,535 --> 00:40:53,080
that fifth CD.

964
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:59,500
What that means is that all of
this is my consumer surplus.

965
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:05,640
Because on every unit, because
I paid a fixed price of $15,

966
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,640
and for my fifth CD, that
delivered no surplus, that was

967
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,330
indifferent.

968
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:13,470
But in my first through fourth
CDs, that made me very happy.

969
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,900
Because I was willing to pay
more than $15 for those.

970
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,800
So my consumer surplus is the
amount by which I derive

971
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,740
utility above what
I was willing to

972
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,400
pay, above the price--

973
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,580
I'm sorry-- the amount
that I was willing to

974
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,010
pay about the price.

975
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:31,070
The amount I'm willing to pay is
every point on this curve.

976
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:36,250
So anything I buy that I was
willing to pay more for the

977
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,710
price for, I derived
surplus on.

978
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:41,670
So this becomes my
consumer surplus.

979
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:46,380
So, basically, consumer surplus
is the area under the

980
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,000
demand curve above the price.

981
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,810
So, graphically, consumer
surplus is going to be the

982
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:56,960
area under the demand curve
above the price.

983
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,110
Intuitively, why is that?

984
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:04,510
Intuitively, what's going on is
that every unit above the

985
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:07,110
price under the demand curve
are units which I valued

986
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,350
higher than the price.

987
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:11,310
So I get surplus on them.

988
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,000
OK.

989
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,100
Question?

990
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:13,957
Yeah.

991
00:42:13,957 --> 00:42:15,556
AUDIENCE: If you're
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] this, would

992
00:42:15,556 --> 00:42:17,160
you start at zero?

993
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,050
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

994
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:21,070
Really, in some sense, you'd
want to start at zero.

995
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,620
It's really the integral
of this whole area.

996
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,660
The problem is it's discrete.

997
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,010
I should have a stepwise
curve here.

998
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:26,790
I made it discrete.

999
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:30,020
But, really, it's the integral
of this area.

1000
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,743
Yeah.

1001
00:42:30,743 --> 00:42:33,158
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

1002
00:42:33,158 --> 00:42:34,610
upward sloping demand curve?

1003
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:34,980
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry.

1004
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,860
AUDIENCE: With an upward
sloping demand curve.

1005
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,690
PROFESSOR: With an upward
sloping demand curve, well, as

1006
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,150
I said, we don't believe
in Giffen goods.

1007
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,870
We think they are a fantasy.

1008
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:46,650
So with an upward sloping
demand curve,

1009
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:47,900
how would that work?

1010
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,700

1011
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,300
So an upward sloping demand
curve, then that would say

1012
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:05,500
that if the price is here, then
you'd have an infinite

1013
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:05,990
consumer surplus.

1014
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:08,096
It wouldn't be well-defined.

1015
00:43:08,096 --> 00:43:09,590
It wouldn't be well-defined.

1016
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,660
So I don't know how
you'd do that.

1017
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,650
That's why we don't like upward
sloping demand curves.

1018
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:14,360
Yeah.

1019
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:14,640
Question?

1020
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,420
No?

1021
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:15,890
OK.

1022
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:19,930
So, basically, what you end up
with is this consumer surplus

1023
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,440
concept which, basically, as
pointed out mathematically, is

1024
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,820
the integral of this area.

1025
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,200
But we're not going to
make you integrate.

1026
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,480
It's basically this triangle
which is basically all the

1027
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,010
units above the price, all the
units for which you're willing

1028
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,290
to pay more than the price.

1029
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:37,990
And you get consumer surplus
on every unit you buy up to

1030
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,420
the point where your
willingness to

1031
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,230
pay equals the price.

1032
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:44,320
And that's our normative
measure of welfare.

1033
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,660
That's our normative measure
of how happy you are.

1034
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,510
And the key that drives this is

1035
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:50,370
diminishing marginal utility.

1036
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,540
That's why we don't like upward
sloping demand curves.

1037
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,280
What drives this is diminishing
marginal utility.

1038
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,860
It's that with each additional
unit I'm willing to pay less

1039
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,500
and less for.

1040
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,680
So I'm going to get less and
less surplus off each

1041
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,790
additional unit I buy.

1042
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,560
And that's going to
be the key thing.

1043
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,540
The key intuition that you guys
have to remember is that

1044
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:12,810
the last unit that I'm willing
to buy at that price, by

1045
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:21,100
definition, I get no surplus
on, or I get a $0.001 of

1046
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,510
surplus on.

1047
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:26,520
Because if I've got a lot of
surplus, I'd buy 1 more.

1048
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:30,670
So, by definition, the marginal
unit is the one where

1049
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,850
surplus is driven to 0.

1050
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:35,810
And units before that are the
ones with positive surplus.

1051
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:37,800
And that's why an important
intuition to have is the

1052
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,260
amount of surplus you're going
to get from a purchase is

1053
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:44,040
going to be about how far away
from the price point you are.

1054
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,680
Those first units are going
to give you more surplus.

1055
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,020
And that's going to dwindle as
you get to the actual last

1056
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,940
unit you buy at that price.

1057
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,860
Any questions about that?

1058
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:52,330
OK.

1059
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:53,310
Let me stop there.

1060
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:55,960
We will come back next time, and
we're going to spend the

1061
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,150
whole lecture talking about
welfare economics, we'll

1062
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,565
introduce producer surplus,
and talk about how we then

1063
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:02,720
think about whether changes
are good or bad.

1064
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,620
