Problem 1 (15 marks, 15 minutes) 
 
A  company  provides  you  with  the  following  information  about  their  inventory  purchases 
and sales:

A.  Using  the  FIFO  method,  calculate  the  company’s  cost  of  goods  sold  for  January 
2004 and the company’s ending inventory as of Jan. 31, 2004.  

 
FIFO COGS = 6units*$14/unit+6units*$14.25/unit + 14units*$14.25/unit + 1unit*$14.5/unit = 
$383.5 
 
FIFO Ending Inventory = 9 units * $14.5/unit = $130.5 
 
 
To double check, Cost of Goods Available for Sale = COGS + Ending Inv. = $514 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

B.  Using  the  LIFO  method,  calculate  the  company’s  cost  of  goods  sold  for  January 
2004 and the company’s ending inventory as of Jan. 31, 2004. 

 

 
LIFO COGS = 12units * $14.25 + 10units*$14.5/unit + 5units*$14.25/unit = $387.25 
LIFO Ending Inventory = 6units * $14/unit + 3units * $14.25/unit = $126.75 
 
To double check, Cost of Goods Available for Sale = COGS + Ending Inv. = $514

Problem 2 (30 marks, 30 minutes)   
(You may answer using journal entries, T-accounts, or balance sheet equation.)   
 
On January 1, 2005, Golf Tee Inc. will acquire a vehicle  from a car dealership  for $50,000.  
The  dealership  offers  to  lease  the  vehicle  to  Golf  Tee  Inc.  for  five  years  with  payments  of 
$12,462  due  on  December  31  of  each  year.    The  expected  resale  value  of  the  car  after  five 
years is $0, and the borrowing rate for Golf Tee Inc. is 12%. 
 
 

A.  By  simply  examining  the  terms,  do  you  believe  this  lease  qualifies  as  a  capital  lease 
or an operating lease?  Explain.   

 
 
Capital Lease, because “the expected resale value of the car after five year is $0”, which 
means that the useful life of the car is five years Golf Tee Inc. leases the whole useful life of 
the car. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
B.  What borrowing rate  is  the car dealership charging Golf Tee Inc.?   Is  it 10%, 12%, 
or 14%?  Explain.   

 
Answer 1) 12%. It is the borrowing rate for Golf Tee Inc. If the car dealership charges more than 
12%, then Golf Tee can go borrow the money from its bank and purchase the car. Therefore, 
12% is the highest rate the car dealership can charge Golf Tee. 
 
Answer 2) 8%. Since Golf Tee leases five years out of the five years useful life of the car, the 
market value of the car has to be equal to the present value of the lease payments. 
50,000 = $12,462 * PVOA(r,5 periods) 
PVOA(r,5 periods) = 4.0122 
r= 8% (approximately)

C.  Assuming  the  borrowing  rate  is  12%,  and  assuming  the  lease  qualifies  as  an 
operating  lease,  provide  the  journal  entrees  for Golf Tee  Inc.  for  the  first  two  years 
of the lease.

Problem 3 (25 marks, 25 minutes) 
 
Use  financial  statement  information  for  Coca-Cola  to  answer  parts  a,  b  and  c  of  this 
question.   
For this financial data, please see the Income Statement and Balance Sheet (pp. 51-53) 
from:  The Coca-Cola Company. “United States Securities and Exchange Commission  
Form 10-K.” 27 February 2004.  Available at: http://www.coca-cola.com/ (accessed July 
31, 2004). 

 
Use  financial statement  information  for Coca-Cola and PepsiCo  to answer parts d and e of 
this question.   
 

For this financial data, please see the Income Statement and Balance Sheet (pp. 58 and 
60) from:  PepsiCo. “PepsiCo 2003 Annual Report.” 9 February 2004.  Available at: 
http://www.pepsico.com/ (accessed July 31, 2004). 

A.  Using  information  from  the  financial  statements  for  Coca-Cola,  compute  the 
current ratio and the quick ratio for 2003.   

 
 
 

 

 
Current ratio = current assets / current liabilities = 8,396/7,886 =1.06 
Quick ratio = (cash + receivables) / current liabilities = (3,362+2,091)/7,886 = 0.69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

B.  What is your analysis of the short-term liquidity of Coca-Cola? 
 
 
From the class slides, we know that an adequate current ratio is around 2.  Coca-Cola’s 
current ratio is well-below that target ratio, therefore the company needs to improve its short-
term liquidity situation.  Nevertheless, Coca-Cola still meets the “minimum” current ratio of 
1; however, the quick ratio is well-below an optimum ratio of 1.  Given the company’s 
immense brand power, this might only cause slight concern among analysts and investors, 
but Coca-Cola’s management should take some actions to solidify its short-term liquidity.

C.  Using  information  from  the  financial  statements  for  Coca-Cola,  compute  the 
interest coverage ratio 2003. 

 
 
Interest coverage ratio = (Net income + interest expense + tax expense)/interest expense = 
(4,347+1,148+178)/178 = 31.8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
D.  Using  the  financial  statement  information  for  Coca-Cola  and  PepsiCo  for  2003, 
which company’s profit margin is higher?   

 
Profit margin = (Net income + interest expense (1-tax rate))/sales 
 
Coco-Cola profit margin = (4,347+178*(1-21%))/21,044 = 21.3% 
PepsiCo profit market = (3,568+163*(1-29%))/26,971 = 13.7% 
 
Coco-Cola’s profit margin is higher. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
E.  Using  the  financial  statement  information  for  Coca-Cola  and  PepsiCo  for  2003, 
which company is more efficient in using assets to generate sales?   

 

  
 
Asset turnover ratio (sales/average total assets) reflects how efficient a company uses its assets to 
generate sales. 
 
Coco-Cola asset turnover ratio = 21,044/(0.5*(27,342+24,501)) = 0.812 
PepsiCo asset turnover ratio = 26,971/(0.5*(25,327+23,474)) = 1.1 
 
PepsiCo uses its assets more efficiently.

G.  Given  a  20%  tax  rate,  calculate  the GAAP  tax  expense  and  the Net  Income  for  the 
year 2000. 
 
Income Before Taxes x Tax Rate = $650,000 x 20% = $130,000

H.  Tax  authorities  prescribe  an  accelerated  depreciation  schedule,  which  stipulates  a 
depreciation  of  60%  and  40%  of  the  assets  historical  cost  in  the  first  and  second 
year,  respectively,  and  no  depreciation  after  that  point.    Calculate  the  depreciation 
expense for tax accounting purposes for year 2000.   

Historical Cost of Asset x 60% = $1,500,000 x 60% = $900,000 

I.  Will  item H. cause the deferred  tax  liability  to  increase?   {For extra credit:   By how 
much?} 
 
Increase. 
 
The  higher  depreciation  expense  under  tax  accounting  will  result  in  a  lower  taxable 
income  than  income  before  taxes  for  financial  accounting  purposes.    As  a  result,  tax 
expense  will  be  higher  than  the  tax  payable  or  actually  paid.    To  balance  the  two 
accounts, a deferred tax liability account will be created. 
 
Change in deferred tax liability due to differences in depreciation expense = 
(Depreciation  Expense  for  Tax  Purposes  –  Depreciation  Expense  for  Financial 
Purposes) x Tax Rate = 
(900,000 – 200,000) x 20% = $140,000
