PROBLEM 5 (10 minutes, 15 marks)  

The press  release below was  issued by Applied  Industrial Technologies  (NYSE: AIT) on  

January 17, 2002. 


"Applied  Industrial  Technologies  today  reported  that  financial  results  for  its  second  

quarter ended December 31, 2001 were consistent with the company’s guidance provided  

in  a December  11,  2001  news  release.  The  company  has  taken  a  charge  of  $12,100,000, 

or $0.63 per share, for impaired goodwill associated with its fluid power businesses.  This 

non-cash  charge  is  being  recognized  on  the  company's  statement of  consolidated  income

as the effect of a change in accounting principle related to Goodwill and Other Intangible

Assets.    This  impairment within  the  fluid  power  businesses  is  primarily  attributed  to  the

downturn  in  the  industrial  economy  in  the  years  following  the  company’s  acquisitions.  

Regarding  the  goodwill  impairment  charge,  Applied  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  

Officer David L. Pugh commented,    'The charge was dictated by early adoption of a new  

accounting  principle  (SFAS  142).  This  new  accounting  standard  requires  goodwill  and  

intangible  assets  with  indefinite  useful  lives  to  no  longer  be  amortized  but  instead  be  

tested for impairment.' "

B.  What  is  the  impact  of  the  impairment  loss  on  the  operating  cash  flow  for 
the firm?

C.  Why do you think managers emphasize that this is a “non-cash” charge?
