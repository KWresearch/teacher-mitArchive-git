PROBLEM 2 (5 minutes, 5 marks) 

Answer ONE of the following two:   

A.  Why is conservatism important in accounting? 

OR 

B.  Why is objectivity important in accounting? 

A.  Why is conservatism important in accounting? 
- Accounting requires certain estimates and judgments.  Conservatism improves the 
process of estimation by allowing accountants to assign values to certain transactions. 
- Conservatism makes accounting numbers credible. 
- Lenders bear the downside risk without upside potential; therefore, lenders would like 
to get the bad news more timely.  Conservatism allows for this. 
- Conservatism improves investor believability of public companies’ financial 
statements.  

B.  Why is objectivity important in accounting? 
- Information produced by managers alone is not believable.  Outside investors demand 
independently audited financial information. 
- Allows investors to better trust the information contained in the financial statements. 
- Allows for consistency in financial information among the different firms.  Analysts 
and investors can then compare various companies on the basis of their financial 
statements and forward estimates. 
- Important for the auditors that review the financial statements.  
- Establishes the internal control system through which transactions are properly 
authorized, reported, and recorded.

+18,750 

B.  What effect does the taxes payable account have on cash flow from operating 
activities for 2003? (5 Marks) 

-1,000 

C.  Are  cash  flows  from  investing  activities  positive  or  negative  for  2003  and 
why? Assume no  loss or gain has  in  the disposal of PP&E.  (5 Marks)  (This  is  
difficult.  Attempt  to  get  the  direction,  positive  or  negative,  by  inspecting 
changes in the appropriate accounts from the balance sheet.) 

Negative. 

(A complete numeric answer would require detailed information on depreciation). 


Net Buildings: 
Net Equipment: 
Patent: 

13,000 = 23,750 + CAPEX – Depreciation – BV (Disposals) 

38,000 = 15,500 + CAPEX – Depreciation – BV (Disposals) 

5000 = 6250 + Purchase – Amortization – Sale 


Hence,  to  calculate CFI,  one  needs  information  on  depreciation.   Given  that  there  are  no  

gains  made  or  losses  incurred,  a  sum  of  CAPEX,  BV  (Disposals),  Purchases,  and  Sales  

would yield CFI. 

We  can  use  the  given  information  to  determine  that  the  CFI  is  negative.    CAPEX  on  

Equipment  is  at  least  22,500.    The  net  change  in  the  Buildings  and  Patent  account  is  at

most  10,750  and  1250,  respectively.  Thus,  the  maximum  proceeds  of  12,000  are  less  

than the lowest expenditure of 22,500. 


D.  [Extra  Credit]  What  is  the  effect  of  dividends  on  cash  flows  from  investing 
activities? (5 Marks) 

None. 

PROBLEM 4 (20 Minutes, 25 Marks) Financial Statement Analysis

For this financial data, please see the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and
Statement of Cash Flows (pp. 53-55) of:
 
      Intel Corporation. "2002 Annual Report." 2003. 
 
Available at: http://www.intc.com (accessed July 31, 2004). 

9 

Using the information for Intel, answer the following: 

A.  ROA can be defined as:  ROA = Profit margin x Asset Turnover 

Calculate  Intel’s ROA, profit margin,  and  asset  turnover  for  2001  and  2002. 
For  simplicity,  ignore  interest  income  and  interest  expense  in  your 
calculations.   

ROA = NI/(Average Total Assets) 

2001: 
2002: 

1291/.5(44395 + 47945) = 2.8% 
3117/.5(44395+44224) = 7% 

Profit Margin = NI/Sales 

2001: 
2002: 

1291/26539 = 4.9% 
3117/26764 = 11.6% 

Asset Turnover = Sales/(Average Total Assets) 

2001: 
2002: 

26539/.5(44395 + 47945) = 57% 
26764/.5(44395 + 44224) = 60.4% 

B.  What is your inference from the trends in these ratios?   

Intel  improved both  its profit margin and its asset turnover.   As a result, Intel was able  to 
generate a higher return on its total assets. 

C.  For  the  years  2001  and  2002,  calculate  one  ratio  each  year  that  is  indicative 
of Intel’s short-term liquidity.  Briefly comment on Intel’s liquidity.   

10 

Current Ratio = (Current Assets)/(Current Liabilities) 

2001: 
2002: 

17633/6570 = 2.68 
18925/6595 = 2.87 

Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Sec. + Accounts Receivable)/(Current Liabilities) 

2001: 
2002: 

(7970 + 2607)/6570 = 1.61 
(7404 + 2574)/6595 = 1.51 

Intel has very high liquidity. 

D.  For 2002 calculate  the Days Inventory held by Intel.    	What  is  the cost and/or 
risk of holding high inventory for Intel? 

Inventory Turnover = COGS/(Average Inventory) = 8650/.5(2276 + 2253) = 3.82 

Days Inventory Held = 365/(Inventory Turnover) = 365/3.82 = 95.6 days 

The  cost  or  risk  associated  with  holding  high  inventory  is  that  prices  drop  quickly, 
particularly  in  Intel’s  industry.    There  is  also  concern  for  the  obsolescence  of  finished 
goods.

PROBLEM 5 (10 minutes, 15 marks)  

The press  release below was  issued by Applied  Industrial Technologies  (NYSE: AIT) on  

January 17, 2002. 


"Applied  Industrial  Technologies  today  reported  that  financial  results  for  its  second  

quarter ended December 31, 2001 were consistent with the company’s guidance provided  

in  a December  11,  2001  news  release.  The  company  has  taken  a  charge  of  $12,100,000, 

or $0.63 per share, for impaired goodwill associated with its fluid power businesses.  This 

non-cash  charge  is  being  recognized  on  the  company's  statement of  consolidated  income

as the effect of a change in accounting principle related to Goodwill and Other Intangible

Assets.    This  impairment within  the  fluid  power  businesses  is  primarily  attributed  to  the

downturn  in  the  industrial  economy  in  the  years  following  the  company’s  acquisitions.  

Regarding  the  goodwill  impairment  charge,  Applied  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  

Officer David L. Pugh commented,    'The charge was dictated by early adoption of a new  

accounting  principle  (SFAS  142).  This  new  accounting  standard  requires  goodwill  and  

intangible  assets  with  indefinite  useful  lives  to  no  longer  be  amortized  but  instead  be  

tested for impairment.' "           - Press release courtesy of Applied Industrial Technologies 


A.	 What accounts would be affected as you  record  the goodwill  impairment of 
$12,100,000? Use the balance sheet equation below or make a journal entry.   

Assets  =  Liabilities  +  Contributed Capital  +  Retained Earnings  

(12,100,000) 	

(12,100,000) 

or Dr. Goodwill impairment charge  12,100,000 
 
Cr. Goodwill 
12,100,000 

12 

B.  What  is  the  impact  of  the  impairment  loss  on  the  operating  cash  flow  for 
the firm?   

Zero. 

Net Income was lower by 12,100,000; but this non-cash charge was added back to Net 
Income to get CFO. Therefore, there is no cash impact from the impairment loss. 

C.  Why do you think managers emphasize that this is a “non-cash” charge?   

Managers like to emphasize the non-cash aspect of this type of accounting entry to create 
the  impression  that  the  charge  does  not  really  affect  the  firm’s  valuation.    However,  the 
fact  that goodwill  is  impaired does affect  the  firm’s valuation.   We should not  forget  that 
at  some  point  in  the  past  the  company  paid  cash  to  acquire  firms.    The  fact  that  the 
company paid more than the fair value of the assets of the target implies that the company 
thought  the  acquisition would  create  additional  cash  flows  in  the  future. The  impairment 
today  indicates  that  the  hopes  of  creating  additional  cash  flows  have  disappeared.  So 
clearly, that affects how we view the future cash flow of the firm.
