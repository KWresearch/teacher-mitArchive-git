Accounting for Bonds 
- Calculations

(cid:134) Use market interest rate at issuance (r) to discount and 
calculate the interest expense. Coupon rate is ONLY used 
to calculate the coupon payment.

(cid:134) Proceeds from issuance = coupon payments * PVOA 
(r,n) + principal * PV(r,n)
(cid:134) Premium/Discount = proceeds from issuance – par value
(cid:134) Interest Expense = book value of bond (net bond 
payable) * r = (par value -/+ Premium/Discount 
balance) * r
(cid:134) Premium accrual = coupon payment – interest expense
(cid:134) Discount accrual = interest expense – coupon payment

Accounting for Leases

(cid:134) Terminology
Operating Lease: Lessee rents the property. Lessee charges rent expenses 
(cid:132)
as they become due in each period.
Capital Lease: Lessee essentially owns the property. Lessee records the 
leased asset in B/S together with the corresponding lease obligation. During 
the term of the lease, lessee charges depreciation expenses and interest 
expenses.

(cid:132)

(cid:134) Criteria for lease capitalization: a lease is considered a capital lease if 
ANY of the following conditions apply.
Essential transfer of ownership at the end of lease term: no payment for 
(cid:132)
leased asset, or Bargain purchase option (BPO) (payment below market value 
after the lease term).
Minimum present value of lease payments (including BPO, if any) at lease 
90% of asset’s market value.
Lease term is 75% of asset’s remaining useful life.

(cid:132)

Accounting for Leases
- Entries for capital leases

(cid:134) Accounting is similar to acquiring an asset with 100% debt financing.
(cid:134) Any payment in advance is recorded as an immediate reduction in the lease 
liability. 
(cid:134) During the lease term, interest expense and depreciation expense are 
recognized.
(cid:134) When the lease terminates, the Lease Obligation is zero and Leased Property –
Acc. Depre. = 0.

(cid:134) Lease inception: Dr. Leased Property  Cr. Lease Obligation
Leased Property = PV of Lease payments
(cid:132)
(cid:134) Each lease period:
Dr. Interest Expense Dr. Lease Obligation Cr. Cash
(cid:132)
Dr. Depreciation Expense  Cr. Accumulated Depreciation
(cid:132)
Interest Expense= interest rate * Beginning balance of Lease Obligation
(cid:132)

Deferred Tax

(cid:134) Permanent differences: Differences between pre-tax GAAP income and 
pre-tax taxable income that will never be reversed, e.g. Government 
Fines, Tax-Exempt Revenue.
(cid:134) Temporary timing differences: Differences between pretax GAAP 
income and pre-tax taxable income that will be reversed at some point 
in the future. Temporary differences create Deferred Tax Liabilities and 
Deferred Tax Assets.
(cid:134) Deferred Tax Liabilities (DTL)
Taxable Income < Pre-tax GAAP income, Tax Payable < Tax Expense
(cid:132)
Taxpayer pays lower taxes today. A liability must be recorded to account for 
(cid:132)
the added taxes to be paid at some point in the future.
(cid:134) Deferred Tax Assets (DTA)
Taxable Income > Pre-tax GAAP income, Tax Payable > Tax Expense
(cid:132)
Taxpayer pays higher taxes today. An asset must be recorded to account for 
(cid:132)
the value of lower taxes to be paid at some point in the future.

Deferred Tax – effective tax rate 
vs. statutory tax rate

(cid:134) (GAAP pre-tax income – income from tax-exempt investments 
– foreign income taxed at rate lower than 35% - inter-
corporate dividends received) * statutory rate = Tax expense
(cid:134) Tax expense / pre-tax GAAP income = effective tax rate
(cid:134) Taxable income (including not only the adjustments above, but 
also different accounting treatments such as depre. Method) * 
statutory rate = Tax payable
(cid:134) Conclusion: DTL/DTA does not contain permanent differences. 
However, the difference between effective tax rate and 
statutory tax rate is partially caused by permanent differences.
