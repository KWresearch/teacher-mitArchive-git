Recitation 3

Why do we need CF/S?

(cid:134) Accrual accounting is often based upon 
subjective judgments that can introduce 
measurement error and uncertainty into the 
reported earnings number.
(cid:132) Estimates of uncollectible receivables, useful life of 
assets, and future pension and health-care benefits, 
write-offs.

(cid:134) Managers can readily manipulate accrual 
income.
(cid:132) Postpone discretionary expenditures like R&D
(cid:132) Manipulate accounting estimates

Statement Format

(cid:134) Operating cash flows result from events or transactions that 
enter into the determination of net income, i.e., 
transactions related to the production and delivery of goods 
and services to customers. In effect, operating cash flows 
are the cash-basis revenues and expenses of a company.
(cid:134) Investing cash flows result from the purchase or sale of 
productive assets like plant and equipment, from the 
purchase or sale of marketable securities, and from the 
acquisition and divestitures of other companies.
(cid:134) Financing cash flows result when a company sells its own 
stocks or bonds, pays dividends or buys back its own 
shares, or borrow money and repays the amounts 
borrowed.

The indirect approach

(cid:134) The indirect approach begins with the accrual-basis net 
income and adjust for:
(cid:132) Items included in accrual-basis net income that did not affect 
cash in the current period, such as
(cid:134) Noncash revenues or gains (e.g., revenues earned but not 
received in cash, gains on disposal of fixed assets);
(cid:134) Noncash expenses or losses (e.g., depreciation and 
amortization, expenses accrued but not paid in cash, and 
losses on disposal of fixed assets);
(cid:132) Items excluded from accrual-basis income that did affect 
operating cash flows in the current period, such as
(cid:134) Cash inflows (revenues) received but not recognized as earned 
in the current period (e.g., rent received in advance and 
collections on account);
(cid:134) Cash outflows (expenses) paid but not recognized for accrual 
purposes in the current period (e.g, prepaid insurance and 
payments on account).

Why indirect approach?

(cid:134) The indirect approach is used by the overwhelming majority 
of public companies. Of the 600 companies included in the 
AICPA’s annual financial reporting survey, 589 (98.2%) 
used the indirect approach for Cash Flow from Operating 
Activities.
(cid:132) For cash flow from investing and cash flow from financing, the 
formats are the same for direct and indirect approach.
(cid:134) Two reasons
(cid:132) The indirect approach is easier for firms to implement because 
it relies exclusively on data already available in the accrual 
accounts.
(cid:132) The indirect approach is more familiar to many accountants 
because this format was widely used in the changes in working 
capital statement that preceded SFAS No. 95.

One way to understand the adjustments

(cid:134) Cash + N$A = L +SE
(cid:134) ∆Cash + ∆N$A = ∆L + ∆SE
(cid:134) ∆Cash = - ∆N$A + ∆L + ∆SE
(cid:134) Therefore, increase in N$A appears with negative 
signs; increase in Liabilities appears with positive 
signs; increase in Shareholder’s Equity appears with 
positive signs.

Another way to understand the adjustments (I)

(cid:134) Increase in A/R means that you collected less cash. 
Revenue overestimates the cash inflow from sales.
(cid:134) Increase in inventory means that you paid cash but 
didn’t recognize all of them into COGS. COGS 
underestimates the cash outflow for purchases.
(cid:134) Increase in prepaid insurance means you paid cash 
but didn’t recognize the payment as expenses yet. 
Expense account underestimates the cash outflow.
Increase in Assets = Decrease in Cash
(cid:134)(cid:134) Increase in Assets = Decrease in Cash

Another way to understand the adjustments (II)

(cid:134) Increase in A/P means you paid less cash for 
purchases or service received. COGS or Expense 
overestimates the cash outflow.
(cid:134) Increase in Salaries Payable, Tax Payable, etc. all 
means that you have not paid cash yet. However, the 
Expenses have been recognized. Expense account 
overestimates the cash outflow.
Increase in short--term financing = Increase in 
term financing = Increase in 
(cid:134)(cid:134) Increase in short
CashCash

Another way to understand the adjustments 
(III)

(cid:134) Increase in PPE, Land, and Intangible Assets means cash 
outflow. However, the Income Statement does not deal with 
them. The increases in Long-term assets are listed under 
Cash Flow from Investing Activities.
(cid:134) Increase in Bonds Payable, other Long-term Liabilities, and 
Common Stock means cash inflow. Again, Income 
Statement does not deal with them either. The increase in 
Long-term liabilities and Common Stock are listed under 
Cash Flow from Financing Activities.
(cid:134) Where do we put the increase in Retained Earnings?
(cid:132) Net Income is at the top of CFO and Dividend is under CFF.

Two ways to construct the CF/S 

(cid:134) Columnar Work Sheet
(cid:132) Step 1: calculate the change in each balance sheet 
item and enter the changes in non-cash items in the 
first column of the work sheet with the appropriate 
signs.
(cid:132) Step 2: classify the changes as an operating, 
investing, or financing activities and enter  them into 
the appropriate columns.
(cid:134) T-account Work Sheet 
(cid:132) Set up a big T-account for Cash. Set up T-accounts 
corresponding to every other items on the balance 
sheet and enter the beginning and ending balance 
carefully.
(cid:132) Analyze the change in each small T-account and post 
the changes into the big Cash T-account.

The choice

(cid:134) Use columnar work sheet if there is no 
extra info on the sale of assets.

(cid:134) Use T-account work sheet if there is extra 
info on the sale of assets other than the 
B/S, I/S.
(cid:132) It’s hard to tease out the impact from sales of 
assets on the operating section and investing 
section without the help of T-accounts.
