General principles
• Objectivity Principle
• Conservatism Principle
– Do we capitalize R&D or expense it?
– Do we recognize bad debt expense even if we do not 
know the exact number?
• Matching Principle
– COGS contains only the cost of the goods sold. The 
cost of the goods unsold sits in Inventory account.
– Adjusting entries: prepaid rent
• Revenue Recognition Principle
– Do we recognize revenue when we receive advances 
from customers? 

Financial Statements

– Net Income = Revenues – COGS – Expenses
– Ending balance of Retained Earnings = 
Beginning balance of Retained Earnings + 
Net Income – Dividends

in the balance of Cash on B/S
