Accounting for Long Lived Assets

(cid:134) The matching principle in action
(cid:132) What dollar amount to capitalize?
(cid:132) Over what time period should the asset be 
depreciated?
(cid:132) At what rate should the asset be depreciated?
(cid:134) Formulas
(cid:132) PPEEB = PPEBB + Acquisitions – Disposals
(cid:132) AccDepEB = AccDepBB + Depreciation – Acc 
DepDisposal
(cid:132) Proceeds from sale (cash) = Net Book Value + 
gain/loss

Time value of money
(cid:134) Cash flows arrive at different time periods. We 
cannot add cash flows today to cash flows 
tomorrow.

(cid:134) Key tool to add cash flows: The interest rate, 
also called discount rate, cost of capital or 
opportunity cost.

(cid:134) Interest rate is a convenient (standardized) 
way of expressing the cost of borrowing or 
profit of lending on a per-dollar and per unit of 
time basis.

Future value
(cid:134) Intuition: A dollar today is worth more than a dollar 
tomorrow. Why? 

(cid:134) Suppose you can invest at 10%:
(cid:132) In one year $1 will become $1.10.
(cid:132) Future value in one year of P invested today at rate of return 
r: P + rP = P(1 + r)

(cid:134) Future value = initial payment + accumulated interest

(cid:134) In general the future value in n years of P invested today 
is: FV = P(1 + r)...(1 + r) = P(1 + r)n
(1 + r)n is called the future value factor.

Future value
(cid:134) Example 1: Bank pays 8% interest on 5-year CD 
and you deposit $10,000. What will it be worth in 
5 years?
$10,000

$14,693

(cid:134) Example 2: Which would you rather be given? (r 
= 8%) (a)  $100 today; (b)  $125 one year from 
today.
Calculate the future value of (a):
$100*(1+8%) = 108

Present value

(cid:134) What is the value today of $100 received a 
year from now?

(cid:134) How much would I need to save today in order 
to get $100 in one year?

(cid:134) Consider saving P today. One year from now 
you receive: P*(1+r)=100

(cid:134) The present value of $100 received one year 
from now is: 100/(1+r)

6

Present value

(cid:134) With an interest rate of 6%, what is 
the PV of $100 received one year 
from now? 
(cid:132) PV=100/1.06=94.34

(cid:134) What is the PV if r=10%?
(cid:132) PV=100/1.1=90.91

7

Present value

(cid:134) With an interest rate of 10%, what is the PV of $100 
received two years from now?
PV
100/(1
10%)

(cid:134) In general the present value of F received n years 
from now is:

1/(1
r)
 
n+
(cid:132) The term              is called present value factor.

(cid:134) The higher the r, the longer the time horizon, the 
lower the present value.
