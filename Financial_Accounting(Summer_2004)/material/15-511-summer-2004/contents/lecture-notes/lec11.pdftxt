Keeping track of inventory quantities:
Perpetual vs. Periodic Inventory Systems
(cid:122) How do we know how much has been sold?

(cid:122) Perpetual system: tracks units sold directly
(cid:122) more accurate, more timely, potentially more costly

(cid:122) Periodic system: infer quantities sold by using 
purchases/production, beginning and ending 
inventories.
(cid:122) Units sold = Beg. Units + Production – End. Units
(cid:122) harder to detect inventory “shrinkage” (e.g., theft, 
spoilage) as well as management fraud

LIFO vs FIFO example
LIFO and FIFO are two assumptions about the 
physical flow of inventory used to determine 
cost of goods sold and the ending inventory
account balance.

The actual physical flow of inventory need
not correspond to these assumptions.

LIFO vs FIFO example

FIFO -- First In First Out

LIFO -- Last In First Out

22

LIFO vs FIFO example

Goods available for sale

The accountant must separate goods available
for sale into End. Inv. and COGS. This separation
is done based on the physical flow assumption.

$ 149,000

If purchases had been 500 units (i.e., equal to
current sales), then LIFO COGS would have
been $1,000,000 ($2 X 500).

If purchases had been 500 units (i.e., equal to
current sales), then LIFO COGS would have
been $1,000,000 ($2 X 500).  Pretax profits
would be zero.

Company seems to lose money by purchasing
inventory.  If we do not liquidate any of the
old inventory layers, we will have $149 less
income.  Thus, we had $149 of income 
resulting from LIFO liquidation.

48

LIFO Liquidation Profits

Another way to compute LIFO liquidation
profits (profits resulting from old costs
appearing on the income statement):

($2 - $1.2) X 30,000
+ ($2 - $1.1) X 50,000
+ ($2 - $1.0) X 80,000
= $149,000

[Units in beg. inv. sold]x[Current costs -

Old Costs]

49

LIFO vs. FIFO--Which is a Better 
Measure of Future Income

(cid:122) If one wants to predict future cost of 
good sold, one would prefer the most 
recent measure of inventory cost of 
goods sold.
(cid:122) LIFO provides a more recent measure 
of cost of goods sold than FIFO if no 
LIFO liquidation occurs.

50

Conversion from LIFO to FIFO --
The LIFO reserve
The LIFO reserve is the difference between
inventory value under FIFO and the value of
inventory under LIFO.

LIFO reserve = FIFO value - LIFO value

Companies using LIFO must disclose this
reserve.

The LIFO reserve allows for comparison of
LIFO and FIFO companies.

51

What is FIFO Inventory?
Beginning
2002: 30 units @$1.2 each
2001: 50 units @$1.1 each
2000: 100 units @$1 each
Purchase 340 units @ $2 each
Sell 
500 units @ $3 each
What is FIFO COGS?
Cumulative units

100  @ $1
150
+ 50  @ $1.1
180
+ 30  @ $1.2
320
+320  @ $1   
= $831,000

52

FIFO Inventory & LIFO reserve

(cid:122) FIFO Ending Inventory:
(cid:122) 20 units @ $2.00 = $40

(cid:122) Recall LIFO Ending Inventory:
(cid:122) 20 units @ $1.00 = $20

(cid:122) LIFO reserve: $40-$20 = $20

53

Conversion from LIFO to FIFO --
The LIFO reserve example
In the previous example, the company had
20 units of inventory at a LIFO value of
$1 each.  The FIFO value of these units
would have been $2 each.

LIFO reserve = [20 X $2] - [20 X $1]
= $20,000

If inventory prices do not decrease, a decrease
in the LIFO reserve indicates that old costs are 
appearing on the income statement.

54

LIFO versus FIFO COGS

Remember:
EndInv = BegInv + Purchases – COGS
=>
PurchasesLIFO = (EndInvLIFO – BegInvLIFO) + COGSLIFO
PurchasesFIFO = (EndInvFIFO – BegInvFIFO) + COGSFIFO

(cid:122) Key:  The  cost  of  “Purchases”  does  not  differ  across 
LIFO/FIFO =>
PurchasesLIFO = PurchasesFIFO

55

LIFO versus FIFO COGS
(cid:122) Equating right hand side of LIFO and FIFO 
equations,

COGSLIFO - COGSFIFO = 
(EndInvFIFO – EndInvLIFO) –
(BegInvFIFO - BegInvLIFO) + 
=
End LIFO reserve –
Beg LIFO reserve

Footnote Disclosures
(cid:122) Kmart, 2001
“Inventories  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or market,  primarily 
using  the  retail  method.  The  last-in,  first-out  ("LIFO")  method, 
utilizing  internal  inflation  indices, was used  to determine  the  cost  for 
$5,537,  $6,104  and  $6,690  of  inventory  as  of  fiscal  year  end  2001, 
2000 and 1999, respectively. 
Inventories  valued  on  LIFO  were  $269,  $194  and  $202  lower 
than  amounts  that  would  have  been  reported  using  the  first  in,  first 
out  ("FIFO")  method  at  fiscal  year  end  2001,  2000  and  1999, 
respectively.”

(cid:122) Vacu-Dry, 1996
“During  1996,  the  company  liquidated  certain  LIFO  inventories  that 
were  carried  at  lower  costs  prevailing  in  prior  years.  The  effect  of 
this  liquidation  was  to  increase  earnings  before  income  taxes  by $ 
642,000 ($384,000 increase in net earnings).”

Summary for Inventories

(cid:122) Inventories are carried on the balance sheet at lower 
of cost or market 

(cid:122) Alternative cost flow assumptions
(cid:122) FIFO and LIFO
(cid:122) FIFO shows balance sheet at relatively current values, but 
income statement cost of goods sold at stale values
(cid:122) Converse for LIFO
(cid:122) LIFO layer liquidation affects income and sometimes 
distorts incentives.
