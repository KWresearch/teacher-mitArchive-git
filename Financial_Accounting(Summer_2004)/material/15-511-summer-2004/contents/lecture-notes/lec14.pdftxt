Contingencies

A Contingency is defined as 

“… an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances 
involving uncertainty as to the possible gain (hereinafter, a 
gain contingency) or a loss (hereinafter, a loss contingency) 
to an enterprise that ultimately will be resolved when one or 
more future events occur or fail to occur.”

Resolution of uncertainty
Gain contingency                         Loss contingency
Acquisition of asset                            Loss or impairment of asset
Reduction of liability                            Incurrence of liability

Accounting guidelines on 
contingencies

The accounting treatment of a contingency depends on 
whether the contingency is:

Probable - the future event is likely to occur
Reasonably possible - the chance of occurrence of the 
future  event (or events) is more than remote but less than 
likely
Remote - the chance of occurrence of the future event 
(or events) is slight

In addition, the amount of the gain or loss must be  
reasonably estimable.
