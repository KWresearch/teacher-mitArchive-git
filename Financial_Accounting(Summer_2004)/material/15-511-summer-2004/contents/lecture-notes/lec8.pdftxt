(cid:131) What is ratio analysis?
(cid:131) The mechanics of and inferences from:
(cid:131) Profitability ratios
(cid:131) Risk ratios

What is Financial Statement 
Analysis?
(cid:131) A comprehensive analysis of:
(cid:131) Strategy
(cid:131) Competition, regulation, and taxes
(cid:131) Past, current, and projected financial performance
(cid:131) Fundamental valuation in relation to stock price
(cid:131) Planning for the future
(cid:131) Operations
(cid:131) Investments
(cid:131) Financing
(cid:131) Our objective in this course is somewhat limited and 
will focus on financial performance.

Analyzing Financial Statements:
Different Approaches
(cid:131) Ratio analysis
(cid:131) The process of examining various financial statement 
items with the objective of assessing the success of 
past and current performance and, perhaps more 
importantly, of projecting future performance and 
financial condition.
(cid:131) Analysis Approach
(cid:131) Comparisons across time
(cid:131) Trend and time-series analysis
(cid:131) Cross-Sectional Analysis
(cid:131) Within industry
(cid:131) Across sectors

Analyzing Financial Statements:
Analysis Techniques
(cid:131) Common-size financial statements
(cid:131) Common-size income statement – as a percentage of 
revenue
(cid:131) Common-size balance sheet – as a percentage of 
total assets
(cid:131) Year-to-year growth analysis
(cid:131) Ratio analysis
(cid:131) Enables inter-temporal and cross-sectional 
comparisons
(cid:131) Our primary focus

Why perform financial analysis?
(cid:131) As a business owner, what performance 
indicators would you like to have?
(cid:131) How fast are the revenues growing (Demand 
Analysis)? – Growth
(cid:131) What is the operating margin? – Profitability
(cid:131) What is the efficiency of asset usage? – Turnover
(cid:131) Do I have an optimal mixture of debt and equity 
financing? – Financial Leverage

6

Why perform financial analysis?
(cid:131) Historical, present, and future (expectations) 
ratios:
(cid:131) Pro forma financial analysis captures expectations
(cid:131) Expectations based on historical and current 
performance and market conditions
(cid:131) Useful for evaluation, planning, and valuation

Profitability Ratios
(cid:131) Objective
(cid:131) Assess a firm’s operating performance
(cid:131) Return on Assets
(cid:131) Measures a firm’s success in using assets to 
generate earnings, independent of the financing of 
those assets (i.e., debt v. equity).
(cid:131) The numerator is operating income after income 
taxes, excluding any financing costs.

9

Profitability Ratios:
Return on Assets (ROA)

(cid:131) ROA = (NI + (1 – T) I + MIE)/ATA
(cid:131) NI… Net Income
(cid:131) T… Tax Rate
Interest Expense
(cid:131) I…
(cid:131) MIE…  Minority Interest in Earnings
(cid:131) ATA… Average Total Assets

10

Profitability Ratios:
Return on Assets (ROA)

(cid:131) Gateway (NYSE:GTW) ROA
(cid:131) (-525,950)/(.5(2,028,438+2,509,407)) =
(cid:131) -0.23

(cid:131) Dell (NasdaqNM:DELL) ROA
(cid:131) (2,645 + (1-.29)(22))/(.5(19,311+15,470) =
(cid:131) 0.15

11

Profitability Ratios:
Return on Assets (ROA)
(cid:131) Adding (1 – Tax Rate)(Interest Expense) to
Net Income provides an estimate of income as if the 
company were not to have any debt.  For example:
W/out Debt
With Debt
(cid:131)
(cid:131) Revenues:
1,000
1,000
700

(cid:131) COGS:

(cid:131) Interest:
(cid:131) Inc b/ tax

(cid:131) Tax (@40%)
(cid:131) Net Income

180
120 + 60
(cid:131) NI + (1 – Tax)(Int Exp)

(cid:131) Thus, the effect of leverage on ROA is neutralized

12

Profitability Ratios:
Return on Assets (ROA)
(cid:131) Decomposition of ROA
(cid:131) ROA = Profit Margin x Total Assets Turnover

(cid:131) Profit Margin = (NI + (1 – T)(I) + MIE)/Sales
(cid:131) Gateway PM  =  -.15
=   .06
(cid:131) Dell PM 
(cid:131) Assets Turnover = Sales/ATA
(cid:131) Gateway AT =  1.50
=  2.38
(cid:131) Dell AT

13

Profitability Ratios:
Return on Assets (ROA)
(cid:131) Decomposition of ROA
(cid:131) Profit margin
(cid:131) Measures a firm’s ability to generate operating income from a 
particular level of sales.
(cid:131) One can identify reasons for changes in profit margin 
between years by studying relation between individual 
expenses and sales (i.e., by performing common-size 
analysis of the income statement).
(cid:131) Asset turnover
(cid:131) Measures a firm’s ability to generate sales from a particular 
investment in assets.
(cid:131) May be further decomposed to examine turnover ratios for 
individual assets.

14

Profitability Ratios:
Return on Assets (ROA)
(cid:131) Summary of ROA Analysis
(cid:131) Calculate ROA.
(cid:131) Decompose ROA into profit margin and assets 
turnover.
(cid:131) Decompose profit margin into expense rations for 
various cost items.
(cid:131) Decompose asset turnover into various individual 
turnover rates.

15

Profitability Ratios:
Return on Common Equity (ROE)
(cid:131) Measures the return to common shareholders.

(cid:131) ROE = (Net Income – Preferred Dividends)/
/(Average Common Equity)
(cid:131) ROE = Profit Margin x Turnover x Leverage
(cid:131) Leverage = Assets / Shareholders’ Equity

(cid:131) Gateway ROE
(cid:131) Dell ROE

Profitability Ratios:
Fixed Asset Turnover

(cid:131) Measures the relation between sales and the 
investment in property, plant, and equipment.
(cid:131) How efficiently is the firm using its fixed assets to 
generate sales?

(cid:131) Fixed Asset Turnover =
= Sales/(Average Fixed Assets)
(cid:131) Gateway Fixed Asset Turnover
=
=
(cid:131) Dell Fixed Asset Turnover

17

Profitability Ratios:
Fixed Asset Turnover
(cid:131) Changes in the fixed asset turnover ratio can 
signal:
(cid:131) A firm making investments in fixed assets in 
anticipation of higher sales in future periods
(cid:131) A low or decreasing rate of fixed asset turnover may be an 
indicator of an expanding firm that is preparing for future 
growth.
(cid:131) Alternatively, a firm might cut back its capital 
expenditures if the near-term outlook for its products 
is poor.
(cid:131) Such an action could lead to an increase in the fixed asset 
turnover ratio.

18

Risk Ratios:
Liquidity and Solvency
(cid:131) Short-Term Liquidity Ratios
(cid:131) Current Ratio
(cid:131) Quick Ratio
(cid:131) A/R Turnover
(cid:131) A/P Turnover
(cid:131) Inventory Turnover
(cid:131) Long-Term Solvency Ratios
(cid:131) Long-Term Debt Ratio
(cid:131) Debt/Equity Ratio
(cid:131) Liabilities Assets Ratio

19

Short-Term Liquidity:
Current Ratio
(cid:131) Sheds light on a firm’s ability to pay for obligations that 
come due during its operating cycle (i.e., wages, 
purchases of inventory, etc.).
(cid:131) Current ratio = 
=
(Current Assets)/(Current Liabilities)
1.67
=
(cid:131) Gateway Current Ratio
(cid:131) Dell Current Ratio
=
0.98
(cid:131) It matches:
(cid:131) The amount of cash and other current assets that will become 
cash within one year against
(cid:131) The obligations that come due in the next year.
(cid:131) Rule of thumb: A minimum current ratio of one.

20

Short-Term Liquidity:
Quick Ratio
(cid:131) A variation of the current ratio is the quick ratio, 
also known as the acid test ratio.
(cid:131) Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities +
+ A/R)/(Current Liabilities)
1.30
=
(cid:131) Gateway Quick Ratio
(cid:131) Dell Quick Ratio
=
0.81

(cid:131) The numerator includes only those current 
assets that the firm could convert into cash 
quickly.

21

Short-Term Liquidity:
Accounts Receivable Turnover

(cid:131) A/R Turnover measures how soon sales will 
become cash.

(cid:131) A/R Turnover = Sales/(Average A/R)
16.68
=
(cid:131) Gateway A/R Turnover
13.32
=
(cid:131) Dell A/R Turnover

22

Short-Term Liquidity:
Accounts Receivable Turnover
(cid:131) An intuitive measure of the rate at which receivables are 
being collected is the days receivable outstanding:
(cid:131) Days Receivable Outstanding = 365/(A/R T)
=  
(cid:131) Gateway Days Receivable Outstanding
=  
(cid:131) Dell Days Receivable Outstanding
(cid:131) Interpretation:
(cid:131) Sustained increases might indicate a deteriorating customer 
base and/or that some customers are experiencing financial 
difficulties.  It could also mean the credit department is doing a 
poor job.
(cid:131) Sustained decreases might indicated that the firm’s credit 
department is being too aggressive.

21.88
27.39

23

Short-Term Liquidity:
Accounts Payable Turnover
(cid:131) Measures how quickly a firm is paying its 
suppliers.

(cid:131) Accounts Payable Turnover =
= Purchases/(Average Accounts Payable)
8.54
=
(cid:131) Gateway A/P Turnover
5.10
=
(cid:131) Dell A/P Turnover

(cid:131) Purchases can be measured as Cost of Goods Sold plus the 
change in the Inventory account balance.

24

Short-Term Liquidity:
Accounts Payable Turnover
(cid:131) Days Payable Outstanding = 365/(A/P Turnover)
=     42.76
(cid:131) Gateway Days Payable Outstanding
(cid:131) Dell Days Payable Outstanding
=     71.60
(cid:131) Analysis
(cid:131) If the days payable outstanding is rising (i.e., A/P 
turnover falling) the firm is facing a financial difficulty.
(cid:131) Low days payable or high turnover rate might imply 
suppliers unwilling to offer credit (i.e., insist on cash 
payment).
(cid:131) Alternatively, it might be that the suppliers’ cash discounts for 
prompt payments are too good to pass up.

25

Short-Term Liquidity:
Inventory Turnover
(cid:131) How quickly is inventory being sold?
(cid:131) Inventory Turnover = COGS/(Average Inventory)
28.97
(cid:131) Gateway Inventory Turnover
=
(cid:131) Dell Inventory Turnover
=
107.08
(cid:131) Why is Dell’s inventory ratio so high?  

(cid:131) A more intuitive measure of the rate:
(cid:131) Days Inventory Held = 365/(Inventory Turnover)
12.60
=
(cid:131) Gateway Days Inventory Held
(cid:131) Dell Days Inventory Held
=
3.41

26

Short-Term Liquidity:
Inventory Turnover
(cid:131) Alternative interpretations:
(cid:131) A firm would like to sell as many goods as possible with a 
minimum of cash tied up in inventories.
(cid:131) An increase in the rate of inventory turnover between periods would 
suggest a more profitable use of the investment in inventory.
(cid:131) Alternatively, a firm does not want to have so little inventory on 
hand that shortages result, and the firm must turn away 
customers.
(cid:131) An increase in the rate of inventory turnover in this case may 
portend a loss of sales in future.
(cid:131) A low turnover rate might suggest that a portion of the firm’s 
inventory is becoming obsolete and thus not selling.
(cid:131) Firms must make trade-offs in deciding the optimum 
level of inventory to hold.

27

Long Term Solvency:
Solvency Ratios
(cid:131) Measure a firm’s ability to meet interest and 
principal payments on long-term debt (and 
similar obligations, like long-term leases) when 
the come due.

(cid:131) The best indicator for assessing long-term 
solvency risk is a firm’s ability to generate 
earnings over a period of years.

28

Long-Term Solvency:
Solvency Ratios
(cid:131) Long-Term Debt Ratio =
= (LT Debt)/(LT Debt and S.H.E.)
(cid:131) Gateway Long-Term Debt Ratio
=
=
(cid:131) Dell Long-Term Debt Ratio
(cid:131) Debt/Equity Ratio = (LT Debt)/(S.H.E.)
0.15
(cid:131) Gateway Debt/Equity Ratio
=
0.08
=
(cid:131) Dell Debt/Equity Ratio
(cid:131) Liabilities/Assets Ratio = (Total L)/(Total A)
(cid:131) Gateway Liabilities/Assets Ratio
=
0.64
0.67
=
(cid:131) Dell Liabilities/Assets Ratio

0.13
0.07

29

Long-Term Solvency:
CFO to Total Liabilities Ratio

(cid:131) Measure the firm’s ability to generate cash flows 
from operations to service debt.

(cid:131) CFO to Total Liabilities =
= CFO/(Average Total Liabilities)
=
(cid:131) Gateway CFO to Total Liabilities
(cid:131) Dell CFO to Total Liabilities
=

0.06
0.31

30

Long-Term Solvency:
CFO to Capital Expenditures

(cid:131) This ratio assesses a firm’s ability to generate 
cash flow from operations in excess of the 
capital expenditure needed to maintain and build 
plant capacity.
(cid:131) The “excess” cash flow can be used to service debt.

(cid:131) (Cash Flow Continuing Operations)/
(Capital Expenditures)

31

Long-Term Solvency:
Interest Coverage Ratio
(cid:131) Measures how many times a firm’s net income before 
interest expense and income taxes exceeds its interest 
expense.
Net Income + Interest Expense + Income Tax Expense
Interest Expense

(cid:131) Interest coverage ratios less that 2.0 suggest a risky 
situation.
(cid:131) If a firm must make other required periodic payments (i.e., 
pensions, leases) the analyst could include them as well.  If so, 
the ratio is referred to as the fixed charges ratio.

32

Long-Term Solvency:
Interest Coverage Ratio

(cid:131) A criticism of the interest coverage ratio:
(cid:131) Uses earnings, not cash flows
(cid:131) Firms pay interest and other fixed charges with cash, not 
earnings.

(cid:131) Interest coverage ratio using cash flows:
(cid:131) (CFO + Cash Payments for Interest + Cash Payments 
for Income Taxes)/(Cash Payments for Interest)

33

Long-Term Solvency:
Financial Leverage Ratios
(cid:131) Liabilities/(Book Value of Equity)
(cid:131) Liabilities/(Market Value of Equity)
(cid:131) (Liabilities + Equity)/Equity

(cid:131) Remember that market values can be and 
generally are quite different from book values.

(cid:131) Role of market-value-based leverage will 
become apparent in the finance courses in 
determining the cost of capital for a firm.

34

Long-Term Solvency:
Financial Leverage Ratios
(cid:131) Expected return increases in risk.
(cid:131) Equity has greater risk than debt, so
(cid:131) Expected return on equity is higher, so
(cid:131) Realized return, on average, must be higher, too.
(cid:131) i.e., interest rate paid to the lenders must be less than the 
rate of return earned by the owners or residual claimants

(cid:131) Financial leverage is a double-edged sword.
(cid:131) Good times will reward equity holders substantially.
(cid:131) Bad times may wipe out the capital.

35

Financial Analysis:
Other General Considerations
(cid:131) Earnings management using discretion allowed 
under GAAP:
(cid:131) Taking a bath:
(cid:131) Pre-booking expenses during bad times.
(cid:131) Creating hidden reserves:
(cid:131) Booking too many expenses during good times to avoid 
showing expenses during bad times.
(cid:131) Off-balance-sheet financing:
(cid:131) Undisclosed liabilities.
(cid:131) Overstating financial performance:
(cid:131) Aggressive accounting practices and fraud.

36

Financial Analysis:
Other General Considerations
(cid:131) Inherent GAAP Limitations:
(cid:131) Value of R&D, goodwill, and other self-created 
intangible assets are not reported:
(cid:131) Nobody stops a manager from providing estimates (legal 
liability).
(cid:131) No adjustments for inflation in U.S.:
(cid:131) Where inflation has not been a big issue.
(cid:131) Expected performance is not shown:
(cid:131) Except in cases of liabilities or losses through conservatism.
(cid:131) Most assets stated at historical costs:
(cid:131) Consistent with conservatism, objectivity, and verifiability.

37

Financial Analysis:
Concluding Remarks
(cid:131) Earnings power:
(cid:131) A company’s ability to increase its wealth through 
operations and generate cash in the future.
(cid:131) Earnings quality:
(cid:131) A measure of the extent to which reported earnings 
reflect “true” financial performance.
(cid:131) Earnings persistence:
(cid:131) The extent to which current income is a predictor of 
future income levels.
(cid:131) Solvency:
(cid:131) A company’s ability to meet its obligations.
