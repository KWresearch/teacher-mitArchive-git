Agenda – Long-Term Debt

(cid:132) Extend our understanding of valuation methods 
beyond simple present value calculations.
(cid:132) Understand the terminology of long-term debt
(cid:132) Bonds – coupon and zero-coupon bonds
(cid:132) At Par vs. Discount vs. Premium
(cid:132) Market interest rate versus coupon rate 
(cid:132) Mortgages – Interest plus Principal paid each period 
(cid:132) Practice bookkeeping for debt issuance, interest 
accruals, periodic payments, and debt retirement.
(cid:132) Understand how long-term debt affects financial 
statements over time.

Bonds

(cid:132)

(cid:132) Bonds
(cid:132) Periodic interest payments and face value due at maturity
(cid:132) Face value (amount)
(Principal) Amount due at maturity
(cid:132)
Interest payments
(cid:132) Coupon rate times the face value of debt
(cid:132) Coupon rate is the interest rate stated in the note.  It’s used to 
calculate interest payments
(cid:132) Market rate of interest
(cid:132) The rate of interest demanded in the market place given the 
risk characteristics of a bond 
(cid:132) Can be higher or lower than the coupon rate

Bonds

(cid:132) Consider a loan with 
(cid:132) principal of $10,000 
initiated on 1/1/01  
(cid:132)
(cid:132) The market interest rate is 6% 
(cid:132) Final payment is to be made at the end of the third year, i.e., on 
12/31/03.  
(cid:132) What annual payments are required under the following three 
alternatives?
(cid:132) Annual interest payment at the end of each year and repayment 
of principal at the end of the third year (typical bond terms).
(cid:132) A single payment (of principal and interest) at the end of year 3 
(Zero-Coupon bond). 
(cid:132) Three equal payments at the end of each year (mortgage / new 
car loan terms).

Accounting for a Zero-
Coupon Bond

(cid:132) The zero-coupon bond pays $10,000 at the end of 
three years.
(cid:132) How much will it sell for?  That is, how much cash 
proceed will the firm receive at the time of issuing 
the zero-coupon bond? 
(cid:132) What is the present value of such a bond at the time of 
issue? 
(cid:132) PV of $10,000, n = 3, r = 6%, Table 2
(cid:132) $10,000 x 0.83962 = $8396.20

Accounting for a Mortgage

(cid:132) In a mortgage, you make equal payments each 
period until maturity.  
(cid:132) Each payment represents interest and some 
principal repayment.  
(cid:132) PV of an ordinary annuity of three payments = 
$10,000
(cid:132) N = 3, r = 6%, Table 4
(cid:132) $10,000 = PVOA (n= 3, r = 6%) x Mortgage Payment
(cid:132) Mortgage Payment = $10,000/2.67301 = $3741.10

Does the Balance Sheet Represent

debentures, due April 2004                 $122,520,712    $112,580,014

1999               

1998

What is the effective interest rate Shoney has used?
Zero coupon bond valuet = valuet-1 × (1+r)
=> r
= 122,520,712 / 112,580,014 – 1
= 8.83%
What  is  the  market  interest  rate  of  the  debt? The  Wall  Street 
Journal reported in 1999 that Shoney’s debt was selling for 210 per 
thousand, with 5 years until maturity.
FVn = PV0 × (1+r)n
1000 = 210 × (1+r)5 

(1000/210)1/5 – 1 = 36.6%

Early Retirement of Debt

You repurchase Zero-Coupon bonds (Face Value = $ 11,190) in the 
open market at the start of 2002 (2 years to maturity) when the market 
rate is 5%.  
What is the market price of the bonds at that time?
