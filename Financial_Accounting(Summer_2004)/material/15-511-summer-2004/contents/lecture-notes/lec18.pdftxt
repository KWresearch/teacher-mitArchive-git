Investments and Acquisitions
Agenda

(cid:190) Understand that the accounting method used for 
acquisitions depends on the extent to which the 
investor exerts influence over the investee.
(cid:190) Understand the effects of dividends received and 
investee income on the financial statements of the 
investor under the equity method.
(cid:190) Understand the effects of consolidated accounting 
on the balance sheet and income statement of the 
investor.

Investments in the Stock of Other Companies

(cid:190) The accounting method for stock investments 
depends on the degree of influence the investing 
company has on the decisions of the investee.
(cid:190) Three methods of accounting for this investment:

Ownership:

<20%

Influence:

“passive”

Reporting 
Method:

Mark-to-
market

20-50%
“significant 
influence”

>50%

“controlling”

Equity

Consolidation

Equity Investment Accounting Rationale

(cid:190)For any company:
Ending RE = 
Beginning RE + Net Income – Dividends
(cid:190)Following the same logic =>
Ending value of investment on investing 
company’s books =
Beginning value of investment + investor’s 
share of investee’s net income – investor’s 
share of investee’s dividends

Significant Influence (cid:206) Equity Method

(cid:190) Assume the following events
1. Purchase: Investor acquires 48,000 shares amounting to 40% of EE
Corporation for $10 per share
2. Dividends:  EE Corporation pays a dividend of $60,000 or 50 cents 
per share
3. Affiliate earnings: EE Corporation Earns $100,000 in Net Income

(cid:190) Record these events on BSE of investor company.

Control (cid:206) Consolidation Method

(cid:190) When the investor controls the investee,
(cid:131) The investor corporation = parent.
(cid:131) The investee corporation = subsidiary.
(cid:131) The parent prepares consolidated financial statements that treat the 
parent and the subsidiary as a single economic entity even though 
they are separate legal entities.

(cid:190) Consolidated financial reporting brings together multiple sets 
of financial records at the time of reporting to outsiders
(cid:131) Each subsidiary maintains its own set of books that is independent of 
who owns it, whether it is one person/company or one million.
(cid:131) Parent has its set of books pre-consolidation.

What Happens To Goodwill in Subsequent 
Years?

(cid:190)After  goodwill  is  determined,  it  has  to  be 
“assigned”  to  specific  business  units  within 
the merged entity (FAS 142)
(cid:190)Before July 2001 (FAS 142), goodwill had to 
amortized over a maximum period of forty 
years
(cid:190)Now, goodwill does not have to be amortized
(cid:190) It is tested for impairment annually

Goodwill Impairment

(cid:190) What is goodwill impairment?
(cid:131) Reduction in value of goodwill
(cid:190) When does impairment occur?
(cid:131) Technically  speaking  when  “implied  goodwill”  from  fair 
value  of  business  unit  is  below  book  value  of  goodwill 
assigned to that unit.
(cid:131) Requires  accountants  to  value  unlisted  business  units  of 
the merged entity!
(cid:190) What happens when goodwill is impaired?
(cid:131) Company writes down the value of goodwill and 
recognizes a corresponding loss in the Income Statement

Goodwill impairment charges

(cid:190) In practice, what do you think will trigger goodwill 
impairment?
(cid:131) Decline in stock prices

(cid:190) In  2002,  American  companies  wrote  off  close  to 
$750  billion  (HUGE  write-downs  by  AOL  Time 
Warner, AT&T, Nortel, Corning, Blockbuster)

(cid:190) An additional $200 billion of goodwill impairment 
charges expected in 2003.

Issues In Goodwill Accounting

(cid:190)Under FAS 142, what exactly does goodwill 
capture?
(cid:131) The value of synergies
(cid:190)What does goodwill impairment imply?
(cid:131) Synergies lost
(cid:190)What else could they be the result of?
(cid:131) A desire to “clear the decks”, or, in other words, 
our old friend “the big bath”

Overall Idea Behind Consolidation 
Adjustments

(cid:190) Consolidation combines the financial statements of 
parent and subsidiaries, resulting in one set of F/S.
(cid:190) But there are numerous items that appear twice.
(cid:190) Adjustments correct for the double-counting that 
would result from simply adding the financial 
statements together.
(cid:190) Some other adjustments we haven’t addressed:
(cid:131) Inter-company receivables and payables
(cid:131) Inter-company sales, costs, and profits
(cid:131) Following through the adjustments of S’s net assets to FV

Summary

(cid:190) Accounting for long-term investments depends on degree of 
influence as determined by percentage holdings.
(cid:190) In equity method and consolidation, the investment account:
(cid:131) increases when investee earns profits and
(cid:131) decreases and when investee pays dividends.
(cid:190) Consolidation process:
(cid:131) Shows the combined F/S of parent and sub, and
(cid:131) Removes any double-counting
(cid:190) Acquirer records goodwill when it pays more than fair value 
of the investee’s net assets.
(cid:190) Goodwill accounting raises some fairly complicated issues
