Agenda
(cid:132) Understand how the matching principle 
influences 
(cid:132) the capitalization of long-lived assets
(cid:132) the expensing of capitalized costs to match 
revenues generated in the use of long-lived 
assets
(cid:132) Understand how differences in “book” vs. 
tax accounting for depreciation lead to 
deferred taxes

Review of Matching Principle

(cid:132) Capitalize versus Expense
(cid:132) Capitalized Costs means show it as an Asset on the 
Balance Sheet
(cid:132) Assets have future benefits
(cid:132) Expense (i.e., not capitalize) when 
(cid:132) benefits are immediate 
(cid:132) OR future benefits are too uncertain or immaterial (e.g., R&D)
(cid:132) Assets are consumed (in future) to generate future 
revenues
(cid:132) Current Assets like Inventory, Prepaid Rent, and Insurance
(cid:132) Non-current assets like Plant, buildings, machinery
(cid:132) NC Intangible assets like Patents, acquired goodwill

The case of non-current 
assets: PP&E

(cid:132) Accounting for Non-Current assets:
(cid:132) What is the acquisition cost?
(cid:132) What is the expected useful service life?
(cid:132) What is the salvage value?
(cid:132) What pattern of depreciation should be 
used to allocate expense over the useful 
life?
(cid:132) Note: Land is the only non-current asset 
that is never depreciated / amortized

Determining Acquisition Cost

(cid:132) What is given up to obtain the asset?
(cid:132) Include all costs required to bring the asset into 
serviceable or usable condition and location.  
(cid:132) Purchased Assets: Purchase price plus cost to 
prepare the asset for use (installation, transport)
(cid:132) Case 1: Cash
(cid:132) Case 2: Financing (down payment plus loan/note)
(cid:132) Self-Constructed Assets
(cid:132) Direct costs of construction
(cid:132) Financing costs (interest on funds borrowed to finance 
construction)

Determining the 
Acquisition Cost

(cid:132) Purchased Assets: Example 1
(cid:132) ABC, Inc. purchases new equipment on 1/1/03.  
The firm
(cid:132) pays $890,000 to the vendor of the machine
(cid:132) pays $51,000 to transport the equipment
(cid:132) pays $8,000 for insurance during transportation
(cid:132) estimates that maintenance will cost $4,000 in the first 
year, and will rise by about 20% annually for 10 years
(cid:132) What is the balance sheet effect on 1/1/03?
(cid:132) Asset, Equipment = $949,000 (= 890 + 51 + 8)

Determining the 
Acquisition Cost
(cid:132) Purchased Assets: Example 2
(cid:132) Seattle Manufacturing acquires a work-
station on 1/1/01.  The firm
(cid:132) pays a $30,000 down payment to the vendor
(cid:132) signs a 3-year note payable for $170,000 at an 
annual interest rate of 10%
(cid:132) pays employees $4,000 to configure the work-
station for daily operations and run appropriate 
tests
(cid:132) spends $11,500 to train the employees who will 
operate the work-station
(cid:132) What is the balance sheet effect on 1/1/01? 
(cid:132) Asset, Work station = $204,000 (= 30 + 170 + 4)

Determining the 
Acquisition Cost

Self-constructed Assets:  Example
(cid:132) Conglomerated Products is constructing a new 
production facility.  Expected completion date is 
6/1/2001. 
(cid:132) During 2000, the company
(cid:132) spends $1.7 million for materials
(cid:132) pays $2.1 million to architects and laborers
(cid:132) accrues interest payable equal to 10% of a $1.6 million 
construction loan
(cid:132) incurs fees related to zoning, inspection, etc. of $52,000
(cid:132) What is the balance sheet effect as of 12/31/00?
(cid:132) Asset, Factory building construction in progress = 
$4,012,000 (= 1,700 + 2,100 + 160 + 52)

Salvage Value and 
Useful Life
(cid:132) Determining Salvage Value 
(cid:132) Requires managerial judgment
(cid:132) SV = estimated proceeds at disposal, net of 
selling costs 
(cid:132) What factors can affect this estimate?
(cid:132) Depreciable basis = Acquisition cost - SV
(cid:132) Determining Useful life 
(cid:132) Requires managerial judgment
(cid:132) The time period over which the asset will be used
(cid:132) What factors can affect the estimate?
(cid:132) Choose depreciation method
(cid:132) What does GAAP allow?

GAAP Depreciation 
Methods

(cid:132) Production (Use) Method
(cid:132) Depreciation cost per machine-hour = depreciable 
basis/service life (in machine-hours)
(cid:132) Depr. Expense = Actual hours used * hourly rate
(cid:132) Example:  
(cid:132) A machine with depreciable basis of $50,000 is 
expected to provide 20,000 hours of service.  During 
Year 1, the machine is used for 2,500 hours.
(cid:132) What is the depreciation expense for Year 1?
(cid:132) $2,500*[50,000/20,000] = $6,250
(cid:132) What is the machine’s book value at the end of Year 
1?
(cid:132) $50,000 - $6,250 = $43,750

10

GAAP Depreciation 
Methods

(cid:132) Straight-line Depreciation
(cid:132) Annual Depreciation Expense = depreciable 
basis/service life (in years) =  (AC - SV) / Years
(cid:132) Used by an overwhelming majority of US firms
(cid:132) Example:  
(cid:132) Avis acquires cars for its rental fleet for $30,000 
each.   It expects to rent each car for 2 years, then 
sell them for $15,000 each.
(cid:132) What is the depreciation expense per car for Year 1?
(cid:132) ($30,000 - $15,000)/2 = $7,500
(cid:132) What is each car’s book value at the end of Year 1?
(cid:132) $22,500

(cid:132) At the time of acquisition of the asset:
Dr PP&E
30,000
Cr Cash
(cid:132) Say SV = 15,000
(cid:132) Depreciable basis = (30,000 – 15,000)
(cid:132) Depreciation = (Depreciable basis)/(useful life)
= 15,000/2 = 7,500

GAAP Depreciation Methods

(cid:132) Accelerated Depreciation
(cid:132) Mostly confined to tax reporting
(cid:132) Higher depreciation expense is recognized in the 
earlier years of an asset’s useful life
(cid:132) Differences between Tax depreciation 
deductions and Financial Reporting
depreciation expense give rise to Deferred 
Tax accounts
(cid:132) More on this at end of lecture

14

Depreciation Bookkeeping

(cid:132) What accounts does depreciation affect? 
(cid:132) Accumulated depreciation account, contra-
asset account 
(cid:132) Retained earnings account, depreciation 
expense
Which financial statements are affected?
(cid:132) Balance sheet and income statement
Does depreciation affect cash?
(cid:132) No
