LIABILITIES: Current 
Liabilities

(cid:132) Obligations that must be discharged in a short 
period of time (generally less than one year)
(cid:132) Reported on balance sheet at nominal value 
(cid:132) Examples:
(cid:131) Accounts payable
(cid:131) Short-term borrowings
(cid:131) Current portion of long-term debt 
(cid:131) Deposits
(cid:131) Warranties
(cid:131) Deferred Revenues / Income

LIABILITIES: Long-term 
Liabilities

(cid:132) Obligations spanning a longer period of time (generally 
more than one year)
(cid:132) Generally reported on the balance sheet at present value 
based on interest rate when initiated
(cid:132) Examples:
Bonds
Long-term loans
Mortgages
Capital Leases
(cid:132) How do we compute present values?  And interest 
expense?

Time Value Of Money

Interest = 10%

Time 1
$1.00

Time 1
$1.10

Time 0
$1.00

Future value of $ 1.00 today = $1.00 (1+10%) = $1.10 at the end of one year.
What is the present value of $1.10 to be received one year from now?

Present value of $1.10 one year from now = $1.10/(1+10%) = $1.00

What is the present value of $1.00 to be received one year from now?

Present value of $1.00 one year from now = $1.00/(1.10) = $0.91

T=2
$1.21

Future value of $1.00 two years from now = $1.00*(1+10%)*(1+10%)
= $1.00*(1.10)2 = $1.21

Present value of $1.00 to be received two years from now 
= $1.00/[(1.10)2] = $0.83

RECALL: PV of $1.00 to be received a year from now = $0.91

Calculating present values: An example

You have just won a lottery.  The lottery board offers 
you three different options for collecting your 
winnings:
(1)  Payments of $500,000 at the end of each year for 
20 years.
(2)  Lump-sum payment of $4,500,000 today.
(3)  Lump-sum payment of $1 million today, followed 
by $2,100,000 at the end of years 5, 6, and 7.

Assume all earnings can be invested at a 10 percent annual rate.
Ignoring any tax effects, which option should you choose and 
why?

Time Value of Money Terminology

(cid:122) Annuity:  a stream of fixed-dollar payments made at 
regular intervals of time
(cid:122) Ordinary Annuity (annuity in arrears): payments occur at the 
end of the period
(cid:122) Annuity due (annuity in advance):  payments occur at the 
beginning of the period

(cid:122) Formulas:
(cid:122) FV(a) = { [((1+r)^N) - 1] / r} * Fixed Period Cash Flow
(cid:122) PV(a) = { [(1 - (1+r)^(-N))] / r] } * Fixed Period Cash Flow

(cid:122) Compounded at interest rate r%
(cid:122) Multiply the dollar amount received by the factor in Row N,

(cid:122) FV of $1 annuity due (annuity in advance) = (FV of an
