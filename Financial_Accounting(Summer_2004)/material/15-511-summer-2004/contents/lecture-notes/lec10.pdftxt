ALLOWANCE FOR RETURNS 

If customer has the right to return the product, the seller must
estimate the dollar value of returns.
Revenue is reported net of the amount expected to be returned.  
Typically, seller sets up a contra-asset account, Allowance for 
Returns:   
• Analogous to Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
• When return actually occurs, reduce both Allowance and face 
value of Accounts Receivable (or Cash) by the invoice amount.
• Return has no effect on Net Income, nor on Net Assets, just as 
Write-off of Uncollectible has no effect on these amounts.
• BSE:     AR - Allowance for Returns = RE
Intel takes a slightly different approach: Deferred Income Liability.

A Quick Look at Intel’s 
Statements
(cid:122) Revenue recognition.  
(cid:122) The company generally recognizes net revenues 
upon the transfer of title. However, certain of the 
company's sales are made to distributors under 
agreements allowing price protection and/or right 
of return on merchandise unsold by the 
distributors. Because of frequent sales price 
reductions and rapid technological obsolescence 
in the industry, Intel defers recognition of 
revenues on shipments to distributors until the 
merchandise is sold by the distributors.

Interpreting Intel’s Revenue 
Footnote
(cid:122) The company generally recognizes net revenues upon the transfer of title.
(cid:122) means that when products ship to customers, Intel recognizes net sales revenue 
(net of allowances for bad debts).

(cid:122) However, certain of the company's sales are made to distributors under 
agreements allowing price protection and/or right of return on merchandise 
unsold by the distributors. 
(cid:122) means that some products are sold to distributors who will resell them.  Intel 
provides a safety net to distributors: returns and price protection.

(cid:122) Because of frequent sales price reductions and rapid technological 
obsolescence in the industry, Intel defers recognition of revenues on 
shipments to distributors until the merchandise is sold by the distributors
(cid:122) means that instead of recognizing sales revenue and related COGS when these 
products ship to distributors, Intel waits for the price/return uncertainty is 
resolved -- giving rise to a Deferred Income Liability.

Recognizing Revenue: 
Is additional service required?
(cid:122) Example of Warranty Coverage: Seller promises to repair or 
replace defective products for a specified period of time
(cid:122) Sales transaction commits seller to incur uncertain, but 
predictable, future costs: must be matched to sales revenues
(cid:122) Example:  
(cid:122) On 7/1, MicroSystems sells 30 laptops for $2,000 each on 
account. 
(cid:122) Warranty period of 1 year, parts and labor, applies to each unit.
(cid:122) Past experience indicates that warranty costs will average 
$40/unit and that 5% of credit sales will not be collected.
(cid:122) As of December 31, actual warranty costs incurred are $700.  
$50K has been collected from the customers, and one account 
of $2,000 has been written off.
