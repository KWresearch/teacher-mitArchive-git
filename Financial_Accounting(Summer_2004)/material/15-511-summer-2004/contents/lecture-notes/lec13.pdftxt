Changes in Depreciation 
Estimates 

  Caused by change in asset life or Salvage Value 
  Apply the change prospectively, i.e., to future years (no 
restatement of past years’ results) 
  Example:  Cost = $100K, SV = 0, Initial UL estimate of 5 
years.  After 2nd year, spend $30K on improvement that 
extends UL by 3 years (i.e., to total of 8). 
  What is annual depreciation expense for each of the first two 
years? 
  What is book value at the end of 2nd year? 
  How do we account for the improvement? 
  What is annual depreciation expense for years 3 and beyond?

	 Example:  Cost = $100K, SV = 0, Initial UL estimate of 5 years.  After 2nd 
year, spend $30K on improvement that extends UL by 3 years (i.e., to 
total of 8). 
	 What is annual depreciation expense for each of the first two years? 
	 $(100 – 0)/5 = $20K 
	 What is book value at the end of 2nd year? 
	 $[100 – (20*2)] K = $60k 
	 How do we account for the improvement? 
  Capitalize the improvement costs.  BV increases to $ (60+30) = 90K 
	 What is annual depreciation expense for years 3 and beyond? 
  Years left = (5-2) + 3 = 6 

  Therefore, depreciation expense = $90K/6 = $15

A brief review of the SCF 


  Cash From (Used by) Investing Activities: 

  Report Cash Used to Purchase PP&E 

  Report Cash Rec’d (if any) from Disposing off PP&E 


  Cash From (Used by) Financing Activities:  

  What if PP&E is purchased using borrowed funds?


  Cash From (Used by) Operating Activities: 
  Under the Indirect Method, firms start with Reported Net Income and 
remove non-cash effects 
  What non-cash effects of PP&E bookkeeping are embedded in Net 
Income?

An Application:  Inferring 
PP&E Events 

The change in Nike’s Accumulated Depreciation account is 
$666.5 - $503.4 = $163.1MM.  
What 1998 events probably accounted for this change? 

The change in Nike’s gross PP&E account is 
$1,819.6 - $1,425.8 = $393.8 MM.

An Application:  Inferring

Investing CF from disposals of property = $16.8 

But the PP&E account shows disposals = $112.1 and Acc Dep 
associated with disposals = $21.4 

Hence, BV of disposals = $112.1 - $21.4 = $90.7 

Loss on disposals = $90.7 - $16.8 = $73.9

Tax and Timing Effects


  Tax Depreciation 
  Accelerated depreciation 
  No judgment in determining depreciation expense 
  Tax Reporting ≠ Financial Reporting ==> timing 
differences in measurement of income 
  Why would a firm prefer accelerated depreciation for tax 
purposes? 
  Why does government allow this? 
  Why not use the tax method for financial reporting? 
	 Different depreciation for tax and financial reporting 
gives rise to Deferred Taxes

both financial and tax reporting.  The tax rate is 30%

Deferred Taxes over Time


Deferred taxes caused by timing differences are temporary; 
they reverse over time.

Summary

	 Depreciation is the systematic allocation of capital 
expenditures over the revenue-producing period 
of a long-lived asset (matching principle). 
	 Depreciation is a function of acquisition cost, 
economic life, depreciation rate, and salvage 
value. 
	 Depreciation does not involve cash. Only the 
acquisition and disposal of long-lived assets 
involve cash. 
	 Deferred taxes arise due to differences in book 
(GAAP) and tax depreciation.
