Why do we care about revenue  

recognition?


 Revenue has a BIG impact on bottom-line profitability ==> 
managers may be tempted to manage revenue 

  Large Sample Evidence: over 40% of SEC enforcement actions 
on accounting issues deal with Revenue Recognition 

2 

Criteria for revenue recognition

  Under accrual accounting, a firm recognizes revenue  

when it has:  

 Delivered goods and the title is transferred to the  

buyer 

 Performed all, or a substantial portion of, the services  

to be provided. 

 Incurred a substantial majority of the costs, and the  

remaining costs can be reasonably estimated.  

 Received either cash, a receivable, or some other  

asset for which

 a reasonably precise value can be assigned

 collectibility is reasonably assured.  

 Guidance on revenue recognition in SAB 101 (Details  

to those interested on the next slide)

Some Details of SAB 101

z	 Fuelled by recent accounting scandals 

z	

z 

Issued by SEC: SAB 101 took effect in calendar year 2000. 

In  general,  SEC  said  that  the  most  common  reasons  for  changes  in  revenue 
recognition policies to comply with SAB 101 were: 
z  Deferral of revenue on product sales until such products are delivered, and title 
transfers to the customer. 
z	 Deferral of various up-front, or prepaid, fees for which the company had not completed 
a separate earnings process. 
z	 Deferral of revenue until certain non-perfunctory seller obligations (such as equipment 
installation) were completed. 
z	 Deferral of revenue that is contingent on the occurrence of some future event (such as 
the achievement by a lessee of certain minimum sales thresholds) until that event 
occurs.

Joseph Weber. “Motives for Early Revenue Recognition: Evidence from SEC

Examples of revenue recognition events 
(common cases) 

z  At the time of sale 
z  Title passes to the buyer and delivery takes place 
z  Reasonable estimate of uncollectibles 
z  Reasonable estimate of sales returns 
z  Reasonable estimation of all other material expenses 
representing uncertain future outflows (e.g., warranty 
costs). 
z  Most common in retail, wholesale & manufacturing 
z  Even when right of return exists?

Revenue manipulation: 
Bill & Hold 
z  Hardware 
Revenue from hardware sales or sales-type leases  is recognized when the 
z 
product is shipped. 

z	 Recent experience of Sunbeam 
“….  In  the  fourth  quarter  of  last  year  Sunbeam  recorded  $50 million  in  sales  of 
cooking  grills  under  an  ‘early  buy’  program  …  some  $35  million  were 
categorized ‘bill and hold’ sales and never even left Sunbeam’s warehouses.” 
-- Laing,  Jonathan  R.  “Dangerous  Games:  Did  “Chainsaw  Al”  Dunlap  Maunfacture  Sunbeam’s  Earnings  Last 
Year?” Barron’s, 8 June 1998, 17. 

z	 Agco Corp – SEC investigating their accounting practices 
“Agco  stated  that  in  some  instances  it  recognizes  revenue  when  equipment 
remains  on  its  premises  after  having  been  invoiced  to  the  dealer.  These 
transactions occur at a dealer's  request, added Agco, usually  so  the  dealer  can 
arrange for its own transportation of the equipment.”

Is this accounting manipulation? – 

channel stuffing & price discounts

z	 Sunbeam 
“... Sunbeam  jammed as many sales as  it could  into 1997  to pump both  the 
top  and  bottom  lines.  ...  Sunbeam  either  sent  more  goods  than  had  been
ordered  by  customers  or  shipped  goods  even  after  an  order  had  been 
cancelled. …” 
-- Laing,  Jonathan  R.  “Dangerous  Games:  Did  “Chainsaw  Al”  Dunlap  Maunfacture 
Sunbeam’s Earnings Last Year?” Barron’s, 8 June 1998, 17. 

z  Recent experience of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. 
z  SEC  investigating “whether  it  improperly  inflated revenue  last year by as 
much  as  $1  billion  through  use  of  sales  incentives...Drug  makers,  like
many  other  manufacturers,  can  boost  near-term  sales  by  extending 
lower  prices  to  wholesalers,  encouraging  them  to  load  up.  But  such 
"channel-stuffing" hurts later sales.” 
-- Harris, Gardiner.  “Bristol-Myers  Faces  Inquiry  By  SEC  Into  Revenue  Problem.”  The 
Wall Street Journal, 12 July 2002, B6.

Examples of revenue recognition events 
(Uncommon cases) 
z  During production 
z  Establishment of firm contract price 
z  Reasonable assurance of collection 
z  Reasonable estimate of cost of completion 
z  E.g., defense and construction contracts. 
z  At Completion of Production 
z  Existence of deterministic or stable selling price 
z  No substantial cost of marketing 
z  E.g., precious metals, agricultural products

Examples of revenue recognition events 
(Uncommon cases) 
z  At the time of cash collection 
z  Impossible to value assets received with fair degree of 
accuracy. 
z  E.g., some real estate land development deals. 
z  Installment approach 
z  Profits recognized in proportion to cash collected 
z  Cost recovery approach 
z  No profit recognized until all the costs have been 
recovered.

Nuts & Bolts Hardware - sales

z	 Its  Year  1:  Nuts  &  Bolts  makes  sales  of  microwave 
ovens for $ 10,000 

z  Say customers paid $4,000 for these purchases with

cash, the rest with their Nuts & Bolts credit cards

Nuts & Bolts Hardware  (cid:173)
receivables 
z  When  Nuts  &  Bolts  makes  its  credit  sales,  it  estimates  from  past 
experience that 5% of its accounts receivables will never be collected 

z  What does this imply? 

z  What are its accounts receivables actually worth? 

z  What is the part of the sale it will actually see? 

z  One  option:  Nuts  &  Bolts  recognizes  an  expense  of  $300  and  writes 
down its accounts receivable to $ 5,700

z  Also, Customer Smith declares bankruptcy & defaults for $50 
z  Nuts  &  Bolts  has  now  identified  a  customer  who  has  defaulted:  It  can 
write off Smith’s Account Receivable 
z  Of  the  original  $300  Nuts  &  Bolts  had  expected  to  see  as  a  default, 
what is the amount it still expects to never recover in the future?
