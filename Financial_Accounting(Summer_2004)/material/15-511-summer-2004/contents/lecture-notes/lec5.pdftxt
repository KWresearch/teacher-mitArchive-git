Agenda for Today

(cid:131) Continue with the accrual process
(cid:131) Intuition
(cid:131) Mechanics
(cid:131) Too many slides and a lot of details!  
(cid:131) Some of these are for self-study and for 
recitations

Cash Flow Versus Accrual 
Accounting
(cid:131) Cash flow accounting 
(cid:131) Measures performance by comparing the cash inflows of a 
certain time period to the cash outflows of that period (e.g., 
cash flow from operations).
(cid:131) Accrual accounting 
(cid:131) Measures performance by comparing revenues (which are 
recognized when the earning process is complete) with 
expenses (which are recognized when assets are 
consumed or liabilities are created).
(cid:131) Geared toward periodic performance measurement that is 
not skewed by investment, financing, and long-horizon 
operational activities

3

Cash Flow Versus Accrual 
Accounting

(cid:131) Accrual accounting 
(cid:131) Based not only on cash transactions but also on 
credit transactions, barter exchanges, changes in 
prices, changes in form of assets or liabilities, and 
other transactions.
(cid:131) Records events that have cash consequences for an 
enterprise 
(cid:131) But does not require a concurrent cash movement in 
order to record a transaction.

4

Cash Flow Versus Accrual 
Accounting

(cid:131) Over the entire life of a corporation, total “income” 
under cash flow and accrual accounting is the 
same.
(cid:131) However, cash receipts in a particular period may 
largely reflect the effects of activities of the 
enterprise in earlier periods.
(cid:131) Similarly, many of the cash outlays may relate to 
activities and efforts to be undertaken in future 
periods.
(cid:131) The matching principle in accrual accounting 
addresses this limitation of cash flow accounting.

5

Cash Flow Versus Accrual 
Accounting
(cid:131) Isn’t cash flow more important than 
earnings?
(cid:131) What cash flows are important?
(cid:131) Future cash flows!
(cid:131) When compared to current cash flows, 
current earnings are more highly 
associated with future cash flows

6

Cash Flow Versus Accrual 
Accounting
(cid:131) Stock price = Present value of expected
future cash flows.
(cid:131) What is “Present Value?” 
(cid:131) Changes in stock prices = f(changes in 
expectations about future cash flows).
(cid:131) When compared to cash flows, earnings have 
a stronger association with stock prices.
(cid:131) Earnings are superior indicators of expected 
future cash flows.  

7

Accounting Earnings versus 
Stock Prices
(cid:131) Top management’s incentive compensation is 
usually linked to stock prices and accounting 
earnings.
(cid:131) Why not link it to stock prices alone?
(cid:131) Stock prices are affected by economic factors that are 
outside of a manager’s control (e.g., macroeconomic, 
political factors).
(cid:131) Consequently, stock prices may be a poor indicator of 
managerial performance.
(cid:131) Combining both mitigates this problem

8

Accounting Earnings versus 
Stock Prices
(cid:131) A second reason for using accounting earnings
(cid:131) Expected versus delivered performance
(cid:131) Firm X hires manager Y on December 31, 1997.
(cid:131) Stock price of X jumps by 10%!    Why?
(cid:131) Market’s expectations regarding the company’s future 
performance improve.
(cid:131) Accounting earnings of 1998 increases by 10%!  
(cid:131) Why?
(cid:131) Manager Y’s actions produce an actual improvement in the 
financial performance of X in 1998.  Stock prices 
anticipated this improvement in 1997 at the time of the 
earnings announcement.

9

Accounting Earnings versus 
Stock Prices
(cid:131) By combining stock prices and earnings to 
reward managers, a firm can reward a manager 
for his/her strategic planning and operational 
execution.
(cid:131) Of course, stock prices do reflect the delivered
performance of the manager as well.
(cid:131) But if payment is on the basis of expected 
performance, then what do you do if the manager 
shirks subsequently?  (Moral hazard problem)
(cid:131) Earnings provide a straightforward measure of 
delivered performance.

10

Accrual Accounting and 
Periodic Adjustments
(cid:131) Accountants record exchange transactions.
(cid:131) But this does not capture all economic activities.
(cid:131) Periodic adjusting 
(cid:131) Required to record activities that have taken place, but 
which have not yet been recorded.
(cid:131) To reduce accounting costs
(cid:131) Some economic activities may be continuous in nature.  
The effect of such activities are accumulated over a period 
and then recorded periodically rather than continuously, 
e.g., consumption of stationary.

11

Accrual Accounting and 
Periodic Adjustments
(cid:131) In many cases, assets and liabilities are 
created or discharged without the occurrence 
of a visible, documented exchange 
transaction
(cid:131) Interest is earned continually on a bank savings 
account as time passes
(cid:131) Machinery depreciates as it is used in a 
company's operations.
(cid:131) Periodically, adjusting journal entries are 
made to record these effects.

12

Accrual Accounting and Periodic 
Adjustments
(cid:131) Adjusting entries
(cid:131) Made whenever financial statements are  
prepared.  Why?
(cid:131) Adjusting entries are designed to
(cid:131) Correctly compute periodic income 
(cid:131) Correctly show balances of assets and liabilities at the 
end of the period 
(cid:131) Will there be a need for adjusting entries if a 
corporation prepares only one income statement 
for the period covering its whole life?

13

Periodic Adjustments

(cid:131) Characteristics of an adjusting journal entry:
(cid:131) matching of expenses and revenues
(cid:131) involves at least one temporary (revenue, 
expense, or dividend) account and at least one 
permanent (asset or liability) account.
(cid:131) never involves the cash account

Types of Periodic Adjustments
(cid:131)Expense or Revenue before Cash
(cid:131) Expense incurred today, but cash paid tomorrow.
(cid:131) Salary earned by employees but not paid at the end of 
accounting period.
(cid:131) Employees earn salary when they perform their duties, 
not when they receive payment.
(cid:131) Unpaid salary is a Salary Payable liability
(cid:131) Revenue earned today, but cash received 
tomorrow
(cid:131) Interest earned today, but cash received tomorrow.
(cid:131) Interest is a reward for lending money, so it is earned 
with passage of time
(cid:131) Interest receivable asset

17

Types of Periodic Adjustments
(cid:131) Cash before accruing Revenue or Expense 
(Cost Expirations or Revenue Expirations)
(cid:131) Cash paid yesterday, Expense incurred today.
(cid:131) 1998 rent paid in advance in 1997
(cid:131) Rent paid in advance asset
(cid:131) Cash received yesterday, revenue earned today 
(cid:131) Cash advance from customer for services not yet performed
(cid:131) Cash advance is Unearned Revenue liability
(cid:131) Matching is the guiding principle in periodic adjustments.
(cid:131) Objective: To match the revenue earned in a period (whether 
received in that period  in cash or not) with all the expenses 
incurred to earn that revenue (whether paid in that period  in 
cash or not).

(cid:131) Accrued Wages
(cid:131) Employees of Sloan Enterprises are paid at the end of 
each week.  
(cid:131) The total weekly payroll is $10,000, which is earned at a 
rate of $2,000 per day for each of the five working days.
(cid:131) Assume December 31 falls on a Tuesday
(cid:131) Books are closed (financial statements are prepared) on 
that December 31.
(cid:131) On December 31
(cid:131) Sloan Enterprises has incurred wage expense for two days
(cid:131) But will not pay it in cash until January 3rd of the next fiscal
year.

(cid:131) How to record depreciation expense?
(cid:131) Equipment                        Retained Earnings
(cid:131) -1,000                                    -1,000
(cid:131) One possibility is 
(cid:131) Dr Depreciation Expense (-RE)    1,000
(cid:131)
Cr Equipment (-A)                                1,000
(cid:131) However, this is not GAAP.
(cid:131) What might be the potential limitations of this

(cid:131) Consider two Companies
(cid:131)
Company A     Company B
(cid:131) Equipment                       10,000            10,000
(cid:131) Instead of this disclosure, let us consider an 
alternative approach
(cid:131) Equipment (cost)           100,000            20,000
(cid:131) (-) Depreciation to date  (90,000)          (10,000)
(cid:131) Net Book Value
10,000             10,000
(cid:131) What do you learn from the second approach?

(cid:131) How do accountants record depreciation?
(cid:131) Dr  Depreciation Expense (-RE)        1,000
(cid:131)
Cr Accumulated Depreciation (-A)          1,000
(cid:131) Acc. Dep. is a contra (negative) asset account
(cid:131) Decreases in assets are credits
(cid:131) So, Acc. Dep. has a credit balance
(cid:131) Represents the cumulative depreciation on an asset 
(cid:131) Informs the user about the age of the asset

years, how do we record it?
(cid:131) Eliminate it from the books
