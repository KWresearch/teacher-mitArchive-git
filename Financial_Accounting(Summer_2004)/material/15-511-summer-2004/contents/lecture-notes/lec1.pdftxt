World of a Sophisticated Financial

Financial Accounting = translates events 
into financial statements
Generally
Accepted 
Accounting
Principles (GAAP)

Events

Management selects 
from alternative rules 
and from allowable 
estimates under GAAP
16

Rules
&
Management
choice

Financial Statements

Three keys to becoming a sophisticated 
financial statement user
(cid:131)Understand the rules and management’s 
discretion

(cid:131)Understand what explains the rules and 
the type of management discretion 
(cid:131) Incentives

(cid:131)Understand how events affect firm value 

17

Understanding the genesis of 
the rules 
(cid:131) Demand for independence: Accounting enters 
objective, verifiable information into accounting 
records
(cid:131) Information produced by managers alone is not 
believable.  Outside investors demand 
independently audited financial information 
(cid:131) In the process, accounting misses out on forward-
looking information that might be valuable, but lacks 
objective evidence (e.g., research in progress)

18

Understanding the genesis of 
the rules 
(cid:131) Asymmetry
(cid:131) Asymmetric treatment of good and bad news
(cid:131) Faced with uncertain bad news, accounting 
tends to enter it into the records 
(cid:131) Faced with uncertain good news, tendency to 
ignore it
(cid:131) Why? 
(cid:131) Demand for bad news
(cid:131) Creditors with no upside, but all the downside
(cid:131) Investors believe bad news disclosed by 
management, but skeptical of good news unless 
supported by objective evidence 
(cid:131) Management incentives affect believability of their 
disclosures
