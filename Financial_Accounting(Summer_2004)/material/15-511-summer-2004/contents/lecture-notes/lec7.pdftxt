Statement of Cash Flows

(cid:122) Reports  operating  cash  flow  as  well  as 
other cash flow information.

(cid:122) Provides  important  information  to  investors 
and creditors. 
(cid:122) In particular, information about 
differences in the timing of revenue and 
expense recognition under GAAP and the 
associated cash inflows and outflows.

Statement of Cash Flows

(cid:122) The cash flow statement separates changes in 
cash into three categories: 
(cid:122) operating cash flow
(cid:122) investing cash flow
(cid:122) financing cash flow. 

(cid:122) The statement sums to the actual change in 
cash during the year 
(cid:122) The actual change refers to the difference between the 
beginning and ending cash balances reported on the 
balance sheet.

Why focus on a cash flow statement?

(cid:122) Net income reported on the income statement provides an 
important measure of performance. 

(cid:122) However, in the absence of cash flow, income does not pay 
the bills. 

(cid:122) Interest and dividend payments, required principal reductions 
on debt, and capital expenditures for plant and equipment 
and for expansion cannot be made without cash. 

(cid:122) Cash provided by operating activities, also known as 
operating cash flow, is a primary source of cash to meet 
these needs.

Why focus on a cash flow statement?

(cid:122) In the absence of operating cash flow, cash from other 
sources can be used to cover cash requirements. 

(cid:122) For example, cash can be obtained from on-hand balances 
or nonrecurring asset sales, new debt or equity financing.

(cid:122) These non-operating sources of cash flow can be relied 
upon only in the short run. 

(cid:122) In the long run, operating cash flow is the only reliable 
source of cash available to meet recurring needs.

Cash flow statement 
(cid:122) In  general,  differences  between  net  income  and  CFO  (cash  flow 
from  operations)  are  captured  in  operating  current  asset  and 
operating current liability accounts
(cid:122) Think  accrued  salaries  expense:  If  employees  have  not  been 
paid  for  the  last  three days of  the year,  the  journal entry made to 
recognize salaries expense is: 
Dr Wage Expense (-RE)
4,000
Cr Wages Payable (+L)
(cid:122) Thus, to arrive at CFO, adjustments that need to be made to Net 
Income: 
(cid:122) Subtract net increase in operating current assets other than cash itself
(cid:122) Add net increase in operating current liabilities

Indirect cash flow statement -
depreciation
(cid:122) What about depreciation?
(cid:122) Net  Income = Revenues  – Depreciation  expenses  – Other 
expenses

the  cash  consequence  of  recording  depreciation 

(cid:122) What 
is 
expense? 
(cid:122) How are depreciation expenses recorded? Quick tutorial!
(cid:122) Say, buy PP&E for $ 10 million at the beginning of Year 1 
(cid:122) Estimated life is 10 years 
(cid:122) Estimated scrap value after 10 years: 0
(cid:122) Depreciation method:  straight line
(cid:122) Depreciation expense every year: $(10 million / 10) = $ 1 million

19

Quick tutorial on depreciation 
– contd.
(cid:122) To record depreciation
$ 1 MM
Dr Depreciation (-RE)
Cr Accum. Depreciation (+XA)   
$1 MM
(cid:122) Accumulated  depreciation  is  a  contra-asset  account 
attached to long-term depreciable assets (like PP&E)
(cid:122) At the end of one year, on balance sheet
Gross value of PP&E: 
Less: accumulated depreciation: 
Net PP&E:
(cid:122) Therefore:
1. Depreciation expense affects Net income (negatively). 
2. The cash effect is zero
3. The difference is in the Accumulated Depreciation account, NOT 
an operating current asset or an operating current liability

To arrive at CFO from net 
income
(cid:122) Start with Net Income
(cid:122) Add depreciation expense
(cid:122) Subtract increases in operating non-cash current 
assets
(cid:122) Add increases in operating current liabilities
(cid:122) Arrive at CFO

To arrive at CFO from net 
income
(cid:122) Start with Net Income
(cid:122) Add depreciation expense
(cid:122) Add any  other  non-cash  (or  accrued)  expense  that  does  not 
affect operating current assets or current liabilities
(cid:122) Subtract increases in operating non-cash current assets
(cid:122) Add increases in operating current liabilities
(cid:122) Arrive at CFO
(cid:122) Some gray areas
(cid:122) What do you do with interest expense? 
(cid:122) Where  are  dividends  recorded  in  the  cash  flow 
statement?
(cid:122) What  do  you  do  with  marketable  securities?  (usually

recorded as current assets on the balance sheet)
