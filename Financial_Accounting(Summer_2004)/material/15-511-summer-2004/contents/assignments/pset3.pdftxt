15.511: Corporate Accounting 
Problem Set 3 
Revenue Recognition and Accounting for Account Receivables 

1.  Dove Company's balance sheet for Dec. 31, 1999 included the following information: 

Accounts Receivable (net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $25,200) .........   $462,700 


The  company  had  credit  sales  of  $870,000  during  FY2000.  Historically,  the  company's  credit 
manager has estimated that 4% of credit sales will not be collected.  

During  FY2000,  the  company  wrote  off  customer  accounts  with  a  face  value  of  $30,000.    At  the 
end  of  the  year,  a  newly  hired  analyst  presented  the  credit manager  with  the  following  breakdown  of 
outstanding accounts receivable and the probability of customer default: 

Age of Accounts Receivable
0 - 30 days 
31 - 60 days 
61 - 120 days 
More than 120 days 

 

Balance 
Receivable
$400,000 
90,000 
40,000 
20,000 

Probability 
of not being 
 Collected 
.005 
.010 
.100 
.700 

b.	

Required: 
If Dove Company continues to use its historical percentage-of-credit-sales approach, how much 
a.	
bad  debt  expense will  it  recognize  for  FY2000?   What will  it  report  as  the  ending  balance  for 
the book value of accounts receivable? 
If  Dove  Company  applies  the  aging-of-accounts  receivable  method,  using  the  credit  analyst's 
estimates  in  the  table  above, how much bad debt  expense will  it  recognize  for FY2000?   What 
will it report as the ending balance for the book value of accounts receivable? 
c.	 What  do  the  differences  between  the  numbers  you  computed  for  parts  a.  and  b.  above  suggest 
about the accuracy of Dove Company's past accruals for bad debt?  Has the company tended to 
over-estimate or under-estimate uncollectible credit sales?  Briefly explain.

2.	 The footnotes to Barnes & Noble's FY1999 financial statements include the following information: 

Revenue Recognition 
“Revenue  from  sales  of  the  Company's  products  are  recognized  at  the  time  of  sale.    The 
Company  sells  memberships  which  entitle  purchasers  to  additional  discounts.    The  membership 
revenue  is  deferred  and  recognized  as  income  over  the  12-month  membership  period.”  –  Source: 
Barnes & Noble’s 1999 Annual Report, page 42, 2000 

Suppose that B&N sold $240 worth of memberships, for cash, on December 1, 1999. 

Required: 
a.	 Show the effects on the Balance Sheet Equation (BSE) of the 12/1/99 transaction. 
b.	 Estimate  how  those  memberships  affected  revenue  for  FY1999  (which  ended  on  1/29/2000) 
and  show  the  BSE  effects  of  the  accounting  entry  B&N  would  have  had  to  record  on 
1/29/2000.1   Briefly explain how you derived your estimate. 

1  As a retailer, B&N has chosen to define its fiscal year as February through January;  FY1999 ends on 
1/29/2000.
