answer in question 1 by tabulating the depreciation assumptions used by the two airlines: 

Depreciation Life 
(yrs) 

Salvage value 

Annual Depreciation 

 

Delta: 
Before 01/01/1993 
After 01/01/1993 

Pan Am: 
Before 01/01/1993 
After 01/01/1993

Depreciation Calculation 

1.	 Dove  Company  acquired  a  new  machine  on  1/1/1999.    It  paid  the  vendor  $4,000  cash  and 
signed a promissory note for an additional $9,000, due in 3 years (10% interest annually).  In 
addition,  the  firm  spent  $400  to  transport  the  machine  to  its  factory,  $600  to  install  it,  and 
$1,200  to  train  employees  who  will  operate  it.    The  manufacturing  manager  expects  the 
machine  to  last  for  6  years,  over  which  time  it  will  provide  24,000  hours  of  service.    The 
estimated salvage value is $2,000. 

a.	 Calculate  the  depreciation  charge  for  each  of  the  first  three  years  using  the  straight-line 
method. 

b.	 Calculate  the  annual  depreciation  charges  under  the  activity  method.    Actual  machine 
usage  was  6,000  hours,  5000  hours,  and  4,000  hours  respectively  in  1999,  2000,  and 
2001. 

c.	 At  the  start  of  2002, Dove makes  an  improvement  to  the machine  that  extends  its  useful 
service  life  to  a  total  of  9  years.    The  improvement  costs  $6,000.    The  salvage  value 
estimate  is  unchanged.    For  the  straight-line  depreciation  method  only,  determine  how 
much depreciation expense Dove should recognize for this machine in 2002. 

d.	 Assume  that  after making  the  improvement  in  c., Dove  continues operating  this machine 
through  the  end  of  2005.  At  that  time,  a  new  generation  of  technology  is  available,  and 
Dove's managers decide  to replace  this machine.   They are able  to sell  it for $1,000 cash. 
Record the effects of this sale on the Balance Sheet Equation, assuming the company had 
continued to use straight-line depreciation.   

e.	 Specify how the PP&E-related bookkeeping entries for 2005 would affect Dove's income 
statement and statement of cash flows.

Inferring Cash Flows from Depreciation Disclosures 

The  balance  sheets  of  Wilcox  Corporation  at  the  beginning  and  end  of  the  year  contained  the 
following data: 

Property, Plant, and Equipment (at cost) 
Accumulated Depreciation 
Property, Plant, and Equipment (net) 

Beginning of 
Year 
$400,000 
180,000 
$220,000 

End of Year 

$550,000 
160,000 
$390,000 

During  the  year,  Wilcox  Corporation  sold  machinery  and  equipment  at  a  gain  of  $4,000.    It 
purchased  new  machinery  and  equipment  at  a  cost  of  $230,000.    Depreciation  charges  on 
machinery and equipment for the year amounted to $50,000.  

Calculate  the  proceeds  Wilcox  Corporation  received  from  the  sales  of  the  machinery  and 
equipment.
