Problem Set 2 
Chemalite 

The  following  questions  refer  to  the  Chemalite,  Inc  case  in  the  course  pack  (Wilson,  David  A. 
“Chemalite, Inc.” Boston, MA: Harvard Business School, 2003. Case No. 9-177-078). You should 
ignore the 5 questions at the end of the case and answer the following in their place. 

1.	 Record  the effects of Chemalite’s 1991 events on a Balance Sheet Equation  (BSE) worksheet, 
filling  in  appropriate  account  headings  at  the  top.  When  you  have  completed  the  event 
analysis,  compute  the  ending  balances  for  each  account.    Alternatively,  you  may  use  journal 
entries and T-accounts to do the problem. 

Note: 

(a)  Label  each  event  in  the  first  column,  using  a  “P”  prefix  for  those  transactions  that 
occurred prior to Chemalite’s start of operations (P1, P2, etc. for events during January 
2, 1991 through June 30, 1991); a “T” prefix for those transactions that occurred on the 
last  half  of  1991  (T1,  T2,  etc.)  and  an  “O”  prefix  for  the  other  remaining  events  (O1, 
O2, etc…) 
(b)  For  each  event  that  affects  Retained  Earnings  (RE),  provide  a  brief  description  in  the 
last column (i.e., Revenue, R&D expense). 

(c)  If an identified event does not affect the BSE, briefly (10 words or  so) explain why 

2.	 Several  of  the  events  you  recorded  in  Question  1  required  you  to  make  one  or  more 
assumptions.  Pick  two  such  events  and  briefly  (25  words  or  less  for  each)  explain  your 
rationale for the assumption(s) you made. 

3.	 Prepare  year-end  financial  statements  for  Chemalite,  Inc.  -  Balance  Sheet,  Income  Statement, 
and Statement of Retained Earnings. 

4.	 Refer  to  the  Cash  account  in  column  1.    Classify  whether  the  transaction  that  affects  cash  is 
related  to  the  firm’s  operations,  investments,  or  financing  activities.  Prepare  a  report  that  lists 
transactions  in  these  three  categories  and  the corresponding  amount of  cash  inflow or  outflow 
(this report is called the direct statement of cash flows).  How much of the total cash change is 
related  to  operations?    How  much  is  related  to  financing?    How  much  is  related  to 
investments? 

5.	 Based on  the  information  in 3) and 4), explain  the apparent contradiction  in Alexander’s mind 
on why Chemalite’s bank account fails to reflect his sense that the firm is “doing quite well”.
