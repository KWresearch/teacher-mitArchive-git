Introduction 

The  presence  of  inductance  in  an  electric  circuit  gives  the  current  an  “in­
ertia”  since  inductors  try  to  prevent  changes  in  the  ﬂow  of  current.  The 
presence  of  capacitance  in  a  circuit means  that  charge  can  ﬂow  into  one  side 
of  the  capacitor  to  be  stored  there,  and  later  on  this  charge  can  restore  the 
electric  current  as  the  capacitor  discharges.  These  two  properties  of  inertia 
and energy storage are analogous to the inertia and energy storage of a mass-
spring combination, which you studied in mechanics.  In a mechanical system 
viscous  friction  causes  damping  and  in  electric  circuits  resistance  causes  the 
damping.  If  a mechanical  system  that  has  a  natural  frequency  of  oscillation 
is “driven” by a periodic external  force whose  frequency matches the natural 
frequency  of  oscillations,  then  the  system  is  said  to  be  “in  resonance”  with 
the  driving  force  and  the  amplitude  of  oscillations  can  grow  very  large.  An 
electric circuit driven by a periodic external voltage exhibits the same behav­
ior.  In  this  experiment  you will  study  the  properties  of  circuits  consisting  of 
an  inductor,  capacitor  and  resistor  in  series.  You  will  observe  the  behavior 
near  resonance  and measure  the  resonant  frequency.

–  17-RLCCurrentVsVoltage.ds 

3  Experimental  Setup 

Take  your AC/DC  electronics  laboratory  and  the  100 µF  capacitor  and  con­
nect the capacitor in series with the coil on the electronics board.  Connect the 
Signal  Generator  of  the  Science Workshop  750  Interface  into  the  electronics 
board using  the banana plugs, Fig. 1,  and connect  the Signal Generator out­
put  in  series with  the  capacitor  and  the  coil.  Connect  the  Science Workshop 
750  Interface  to  the  computer  using  the  SCSI  cable. 

Connect  the  power  supply  to  the  750  Interface  and  turn  on  the  interface 
power.  Always  turn on  the  interface before powering up  the computer.  Turn 
on  your  computer.  The  Data  Studio  ﬁles  (17-RLC.ds,  17-RLCcurve.ds  and 
17-RLCCurrentVsVoltage.ds)  should  be  on  the  desktop.  If  any  are  missing, 
please  contact  the  instructor.  The  ﬁle  17-RLC.ds  has  a  Signal  Generator 
Display,  and  a  Scope  Display  2. 
In  the  Signal  Generator  dialog  box  choose  a  Sine  Wave  Function.  If 
necessary,  adjust  the  Amplitude  to  2.0  V,  the  Frequency  to  10  Hz  and  the 
Sampling  Rate  to  5000  Hz.  The  resistance  of  the  coil  is  5.4  ohms  and  its 
inductance  is  8.5 mH. 

1.  Draw  in  the  space  provided  below  a  circuit  diagram  showing  the  resis­
tance  of  the  coil  (inductor),  inductor,  capacitor  and  frequency  genera­
tor.

Measuring  the  resonant  frequency 

Click  “Start”  to  begin  collecting  data.  On  the  Scope  display  you  should  see 
two waveforms for the Output Voltage and the Output Current (if necessary, 
click  the  Trigger  control  on  the  Scope  display  to  stabilize  the  picture).  You 
can  adjust  the  display  using  the  controls.  Increase  the  frequency  of  the 
sine  wave  in  10Hz  steps  (you  change  the  frequency  in  the  Signal  Generator 
window).  Identify a  range of  frequencies where the Output Current seems to 
have  a  maximum.  Then  use  smaller  frequency  steps  (say,  2Hz)  in  order  to

locate  the  resonant  frequency more precisely.  Record  the  resonant  frequency 
at which  the Output Current  reaches  a maximum.  Record  your  answer  here 

� max = 

Hz 

Answer  the  following  questions: 

3.  Does your value agree with  the  theoretical value you calculated above? 

4.  How does the phase relation between Output Current and Output Volt­
age  change  as  you  increase  the  frequency  from  below  the  resonant  fre­
quency  to  above  it? 

5.  How  could  you  use  this  information  to  help  pinpoint  the  resonant  fre­
quency?  1 

Since  the  Output  Voltage  and  Output  Current  are  in  phase  with  each 
other  at  resonance,  the  output  power  P  varies  as  the  square  of  a  sinusoidal 
function.  The  maximum  value  of  the  output  power  is  P max  = I max V max  and 
the  average power  supplied, < P  > is  one half  of  the maximum  (because  the 
average  value  of  sin2  is  1/2.) 
Carry  out  the  following  calculations: 

6.  Compute  the  average  power  consumed  by  your  circuit  at  resonance. 

7.  The  power  lost  in  a  resistor  is  I 2R.  For  a  sinusoidal  current,  average 
value  of  I 2  is  1/2  of  I 2 
.  Compute  the  average  value  of  I 2R  at  the 
max 
resonant  frequency.  Compare  that  with  the  average  power  consumed 
by  the  circuit. 

1Use  the  Smart  Tool  to measure  the  amplitude  of  the Output  Current  at  the  resonant 
frequency.  NOTE  on  using  the  Smart  Tool  in  the  Scope  Display:  When  you  have  more 
than one  signal being displayed on  the Scope, you can have a Smart Tool  for EACH  trace. 
You need separate Smart Tools because each  signal can have a diﬀerent scale.  Look at  the 
right  side  of  the  display.  Click  the  name  of  the  signal  you  want  to make  active  and  a  box 
will  appear  around  it.  Then  click  on  the  Smart  Tool  button  and  a  Smart  Tool  cursor  will 
appear  in  the  color  of  that  trace.  You  can  do  the  same  for  the  other  trace.

5  Unknown  capacitors 

You  will  be  given  two  capacitors  of  unknown  values.  For  each  one,  put  it 
into  the  circuit  and  ﬁnd  the  resonant  frequency.  Use  this  frequency  to  ﬁnd 
the  value  of  each  capacitor.

6  The resonance curve and the Quality factor 

The  resonance  curve  and  the  “Quality  factor”  Now  examine  the  behavior 
of  the  circuit  near  resonance  in  more  detail.  For  this  purpose  it  is  more 
convenient  to  use  a  Graph  display  than  the  scope,  so  download  and  open 
the  ﬁle  17-RLCcurve.ds,  which  should  simplify  data  collection.  Starting  at 
20Hz  on  the  Signal  Generator,  click  Start  to  obtain  the  maximum  value  of 
the  output  current  for  this  frequency.  As  the  data  is  taken,  this  maximum 
value  is  automatically  calculated  and  placed  in  the  box  identifying  the  data 
run. 
Record  the maximum value of  the current  for  this 20 Hz  frequency  in  the 
Resonance Data Table on the right, in the ﬁrst row of the column to the right 
of the frequency column.  Then increase the frequency of the Signal Generator 
to the next value of the current in the Resonance Data Table and again record 
the  maximum  current  in  the  data  table.  As  you  enter  data  in  the  table  a 
curve will be drawn.  Continue doing this until you have taken measurements 
at  all  of  the  listed  frequencies  in  the  Resonance  Data  Table.  If  you  want  to 
better  deﬁne  the  shape  of  the  curve  around  the  resonance,  take  extra  data 
points  near  the  resonant  frequency  so  you  can  see  clearly  what  happens  to 
the  current  there  .  What  this  curve  tells  you  is  that  if  a  large  number  of 
diﬀerent  sine-wave  voltage  signals  were  all  added  together  and  connected  to

this  circuit,  only  those  with  frequencies  near  the  resonant  frequency  will  be 
able  to  produce  signiﬁcant  currents,  that  is,  the  circuit  would  be  tuned  to 
“hear”  only  those  signals  and  ignore  the  others.  Obviously,  something  of 
this  sort  occurs  in  the  tuner  of  a  radio.  The  quality  factor  of  a  circuit  is  a 
measure  of  how  sharp  the  resonance  curve  is.  It  is  deﬁned  as 
� o
�2  − �1 
where � o  is the resonant frequency and �1  and �2  are the frequencies for which 
the  output  power  drops  to  half  of  its  value  at  �o ,  Fig.  3.  (In  other  words, 
these  are  the  frequencies  for  which  the  output  current  drops  to  1/�2 �  0.7 
of  its  value  at  � o .)  In  a  radio  tuner,  Q  may  range  from  10  to  100  or  so. 
Compute Q  for  your  circuit.

Q= 

7  Phase  relationship 

An  interesting way  of  exploring  the  phase  relationships  between  current  and 
voltage in a resonant circuit is to graph the Output Current versus the Output 
Voltage.  You  can  either  do  this  following  the  instructions  below  using  the 
ﬁle  17-RLC.ds  (re-open  it),  or  you  can  download  a  diﬀerent  ﬁle  named  17-
RLCCurrentVsVoltage.ds  for which  the  display  is  already  set  up.  To  amend 
the re-opened 17-RLC.ds ﬁle, go to the Scope display click on the box labelled 
Output Voltage  and delete  it  from  the display.  Then  go  to  the Data window 
on  the  left  and  click  and  drag  the  icon  for  Output  Voltage  into  the  scope 
window  and  drop  it  on  the  time  setting  at  the  bottom  of  the  scope  display. 
Now  Start  observing  data,  using  either  this  amended  17-RLC.ds  ﬁle,  or  the 
newly  downloaded  17-RLCCurrentVsVoltage.ds  ﬁle.  Adjust  the  displayed 
signal so that it is wide enough and tall enough to be seen clearly.  Change the 
frequency  of  the  Signal  Generator.  Observe  what  happens  at  the  resonance 
frequency of the circuit.  When you are exactly at resonance, the scope should 
display  a  straight  line.  Can  you  explain  this  behavior?
