Introduction1 

Hertz ﬁrst generated electromagnetic waves in 1888, and we replicate Hertz’s 
original  experiment  here.  The  method  he  used  was  to  charge  and  discharge 
a  capacitor  connected  to  a  spark  gap  and  an  antenna.  When  the  spark 
“jumps”  across  the  gap  (once  per  0.13  milliseconds  in  our  experiment),  the 
antenna  is  excited  by  this  discharge  current,  and  charges  oscillate  back  and 
forth  in  the  antenna  at  the  antenna’s  natural  resonance  frequency.  For  our 
experiment  this  natural  resonance  frequency  of  the  antenna  is  very  high, 
about  2.4  ×109  cycles  per  second  or  2.4  GHz.  For  a  brief  period  around 
the breakdown  (“spark”)  the  antenna  radiates  electromagnetic waves  at  this 
high  frequency.  We  will  detect  and  ﬁnd  the  wavelength  �  of  these  bursts  of 
radiation.  Using  the  relation  f �  =  c  = 3 × 1010cm /s  ,  we  will  then  deduce 
the  natural  resonance  frequency  of  the  antenna,  around  2.4  GHz,  and  show 
that  it  is what we expect on the basis of the very simple considerations given 
below. 

The  Experimental  Method 

Here  in  broad  outline  is  how  the  experiment  works.  The  25  pF  capacitor 
shown in Fig. 1 is charged by a high voltage power supply on your electronics

board.  This voltage is typically 700 Volts, but this is a very safe level because 
the  current  is  limited  to  a  very  small  value  across  the  capacitor.  When  the 
voltage  is  high  enough  and  the  distance  between  the  conductors  in  your 
“spark  gap”  is  small  enough,  the  capacitor  discharges  across  the  gap.  This 
happens  when  the  electric  ﬁeld  in  the  gap  exceeds  the  breakdown  ﬁeld  of 
air  (about  a  10kV/cm).  The  radiation  we  are  seeking  is  generated  in  this 
discharge  (see  explanation  below).  After  discharging,  the  capacitor  charges 
up  again  through  a  4.5  �  resistor.  The  time  constant  is: 
ω  = RC  = (4.5 × 106�)(25 × 10−12F ) = 1.3 × 10−4 sec 
So  the  charging  and  breakdown  will  generate  a  spark  discharge  about  every 
0.13 msec. 

The  Resonant  Frequency  Of  The  Antenna 

During  the  discharge  across  the  spark  gap,  the  antenna  acts  as  an  LC  oscil­
lator  in  which  energy  sloshes  back  and  forth  between  magnetic  and  electric 
energy.  Initially, when the two halves of the antenna are charged up with op­
posites  signs  of  charge,  the  two  halves  of  the  antenna  act  as  capacitor  plates 
with energy stored in the electric ﬁeld between them.  When breakdown starts 
and  current  ﬂows  across  the  gap  to  discharge  the  antenna  halves,  energy  is 
transferred  from  electric  to magnetic  energy associated with  the ﬂowing  cur­
rent.  The  antenna  halves  discharge,  but  the  current  continues  on  in  the 
same  direction  (“overshoots”),  charging  up  the  two  halves  of  the  antenna 
to  the  opposite  polarity  from  the  original  conﬁguration.  The  current  then 
goes  to  zero,  but  the  recharged  antenna  (with  opposite  polarity)  now  drives 
current  in  the  opposite  direction,  discharging  the  antenna  halves  again  and 
then  recharging  them  back  to  the  original  polarity. 
This  process  continues  on  and  on  for  many  cycles  at  the  resonance  fre­
quency  �  = 1/�LC .  How  fast  do  these  oscillations  take  place?  Here  is  a 
crude  estimate  that  turns  out  to  be  right.  If  l  is  the  length  of  one  of  the 
halves  of  the  antenna  (about  31 mm  in  our  case),  then  the  distance  that  the 
charge  oscillation  travels  going  from  the  (+-)  polarity  to  the  (-+)  polarity 
and back again to the original (+-) polarity is 4l  (from one tip of the antenna 
to  the  other  tip  and  back  again).  The  time  T  it  takes  to  do  this,  assuming 
that  information  is  ﬂowing  at  the  speed  of  light,  is  T =  4l /c ,  where  c  is  the 
speed  of  light.  If  the  charges  are being  shaken  back  and  forth  at  a  frequency

transmitter,  the  thumb  tack  conductors  have  been  replaced  by  newer  half 
cylindrical  conductors.

of  1/T,  they  will  radiate  electromagnetic  radiation  at  this  frequency.  For  l 
=  31 mm,  this  estimate  of  the  frequency  radiated  is 
3 × 108m/s
0.124m 

= 2.4 × 109Hz = 2.4GHz. 
Electromagnetic waves with  this  frequency will  have  a wavelength  of  c/f ,  or 
4l. 

frad  = 1/T  = c/4l =

Thus  our  simple  picture  predicts  that  we  will  generate  electromagnetic 
radiation  with  this  antenna  with  wavelengths  of  about  12.4  cm,  and  that  is 
something  that  we  will  experimentally  conﬁrm  in  this  experiment. 
The  oscillations  of  the  charge  back  and  forth  between  the  two  halves  of 
the  antenna  damp  out  as  energy  is  dissipated,  and  the  antenna  is  ﬁnally 
discharged.  Then  the  25  pF-capacitor  starts  charging  up  again,  ultimately 
headed  toward  breakdown  in  another  0.13  millisecond.  The  antenna  will 
thus  emits  bursts  of  damped  radiation  at  frequencies  around  2.4  GHz  every 
1.3 × 10−4  sec.  The overall  time  series  looks  like Fig. 2 on a  long  time  scale: 
And,  if  we  blow  up  the  region  around  the  spark  discharge,  is  shown  in 
Fig.  3: 
The  curves  just  above  represent  the  current  ﬂowing  in  your  receiver  as  a 
result  of  the  oscillating  electric  ﬁelds  of  the microwave  radiation.  We  have  a 
diode  in  the  receiver  that  allows  current  to  ﬂow  in  only  one  direction,  and 
we  detect  that  current  using  the  ampliﬁer  and multimeter.

Setting  up  the  Apparatus 

WARNING:  DO  NOT  TOUCH  PARTS  ON  YOUR  ELECTRON­
ICS  BOARD  WHILE  OPERATING,  SINCE  THEY  MAY  BE­
COME  QUITE  WARM!!! 
Plug  the  power  supply  into  your  electronics  board  at  the  position  indi­
cated.  Plug  in  your  receiving  antenna  (which  looks  like  the  tube  to  the  left) 
to  the  remaining  input  jack  on  the  board.  Your  transmitting  antenna  is  the 
clothespin  assembly,  and  is  already  connected.  Once  you  have  connected  up 
the  power  supply,  turn  on  the  transmitter  (using  the  oﬀ-on  switch-the  LED 
will  light  when  it  is  on). 
Your  one  remaining  task  is  to  adjust  the  spark  gap  using  the  wing  nut 
on  the  clothespin  antenna  until  you  get  a  spark  discharge.  Once  you  get 
that  discharge,  and  learn  how  to  make  it  reasonably  steady,  you  can  use 
your  receiver  to  make  measurements  of  the  radiation  emitted.  Arrange  the 
transmitting antenna (Figure 4 above right) on your desktop as far away from 
metal  as  possible.  Put  your  electronics  boards  on  the  desk  and  somewhat 
back  so  that  you  can  explore  the  radiation  ﬁeld  with  the  receiver  (Figure 
4  above  left).  You  should  be  able  to  move  the  receiving  antenna  from  a 
few  inches  from  the  transmitter  to  as  far  as  the  shielded  wire  will  let  you

go  on  the  other  side  –  for  larger  distances,  move  the  ampliﬁer.  Now,  with 
your  power  supply  connected,  vary  the  distance  between  the  thumbtacks 
by  adjusting  the  nut.  You  will  be  able  to  see  the  spark  when  breakdown 
occurs.  To measure  the  characteristics  of  the  radiation  emitted,  you  explore 
the  radiation  generated  using  signals  from  your  receiver  that  are  ampliﬁed 
by  an  ampliﬁer  and  read  out  on  your  voltmeter. 

Exercise  1:  Measuring  The  Polarization 

Prediction  1-1:  The  radiation  we  are  generating  is  produced  by  charges 
oscillating back and forth between the two halves of your antenna (see Figure 
1  above).  If  you  hold  the  receiver  in  the  two  orientations  shown  in  Figure  4 
above,  which  should  produce  the  biggest  signal  on  the  voltmeter  connected 
to  your  receiver?  (Answer  before  starting  the  lab.) 

Receiver  wire  vertical 

Receiver  wire  horizontal 

Activity  1-1:  Measure  the  polarization  with  your  receiver  and  check 
this  prediction. 

Exercise  2:  Measuring  The  Angular  Dependence 

Prediction  2-1:  The  radiation  we  are  generating  is  produced  by  charges 
oscillating  back  and  forth  along  the  length  of  your  antenna.  If  you  move 
the  receiver  in  the  two  patterns  shown  above(Fig.  5),  which  should  show 
the  biggest  change  in  signal  on  your  voltmeter  over  the  range  of  motion?

Activity  2-1:  Measure  the  angular dependence  of  the  emitted  radiation 
with  your  receiver  and  check  this  prediction.  Record  the  voltage  on  at  �=0, 
30,  45,  60  and  90  degrees.  Plot  on  the  the  graph  paper  provided.  �  is  the 
polar  angle,  taking  the  antenna  along  the  ˆz  axis.  Does  you  plot  agree  with 
what  you  expect? 

Exercise  3:  Measuring  the  radial  dependence 

Prediction  3-1  Do  you  expect  the  reading  on  the  volt meter  to  go  like  1/r 
or  1/r2?  (Answer  before  starting  the  lab.) 
Activity  3-1  Measure  and  record  the  signal  strength  at  �=0  for  r  =10, 
20,  30cm,  ....  increments  as  far  out  as  you  can  and  plot  on  the  graph  paper 
provided.  Does  your  plot  agree  with  prediction? 

Exercise  4:  Measuring  The  Wavelength 

This  is  by  far  the most  challenging  part  of  the  experiment.  We will measure 
the  wavelength  of  the  radiation  from  your  transmitter  by  using  a  reﬂector 
to  reﬂect  the  radiation  so  that  it  returns  to  interfere  with  itself.  By  mea­
suring  the  distance  we  must  move  the  reﬂector  to  go  from  constructive  to 
destructive  interference  and back  again, we will determine  the wavelength  of 
the  radiation. 
First  adjust  your  gap  so  that  the  spark  produces  a  steady  reading  on  the 
meter.  Unless  you  can  perform  this  task,  you  will  have  a  hard  time  locating 
the  adjacent  maxima  and  minima  blow.  Then  set  up  one  of  the  reﬂectors 
you  are  given  in  the  positions  shown  below,  and  position  the  receiver  and 
transmitter  as  shown.  With  this  conﬁguration,  you  want  to  vary  the 
distance  between  the  reﬂector  and  transmitter,  holding  both  the 
transmitter  and  receiver  ﬁxed  in  space. 
Search  for  the  positions  for  constructive  and  destructive  interference  by 
moving  the  reﬂector  slowly  toward  or  away  from  the  transmitter,  watching 
the  voltmeter  scale  as  you  do  so.  The  clearest  signal  is  probably  obtained  in 
moving the reﬂector in the region from about 10 cm to about 24 cm away from 
the transmitter.  You hope to see the voltage rise and drop rhythmically with 
your  motion  as  you  move  along  this  distance.  Adjacent  maxima  should  be 
separated by  1 
2  wavelength.  A maximum and a minimum should be separated

1by  4  wavelength.  Make  a  number  of  diﬀerent  measurements  to  arrive  at  a 
reasonable  average  for  the  wavelength  of  your  wave  using  this method. 
Problems  In  Making  The  Measurement:  It  is  not  easy  to  get  a 
convincing result here unless the spark is cooperating.  Cleaning the tack faces 
with  a  scrap  of  paper  will  usually  calm  things  down,  at  least  for  a  fraction 
of  a  minute.  Mark  the  positions  of  the  antenna  that  give  meter  maxima 
(minima would do as well), performing the sweep several times to counteract 
the  spark’s  general  jumpiness.  Use  your  ruler  to  get  the  wavelengths.  It  is 
best  for  one  person  to  both  move  the  receiver  and  judge  the  meter  reading, 
a  subtle  feedback mechanism.  The  peaks  are  a  half- wavelength  apart.
