We  have  learnt  how   to  calculate   div � = limΔV →0 
F

we   will  now  work  out   the   divergence  for  simple  functions  in  cylindrical  and  spherical 
coordinates.  
Cylindrical:  consider  a  function  � =  F (ρ) ˆ

ρ,  where  ρ  is  the   radius  of   a  cylinder. 
F
Consider   a   cylindrical  shell  with  inner  radius  ρ,  outer  radius  ρ +  Δρ,  and  height  h.

Take  the  normal  on  the   inside   to  point  in,  that  of the   outside  to  point  out. (ﬁgure  2)


(a)  what  is   the  total  ﬂux  through  this  shell? 
(b) Divide  by the  volume  of the   shell,  take   the  limit  Δρ →  0. What  is  div �F ? 
Spherical:  consider   � =  F (r)ˆ
r,  where  r  is  spherical  radius.  Consider  a  spherical  shell 
F
with  inner  radius  r  and  outer  radius  r +  Δr .  Take   the   normal  on  the   inside  to  point 
in,  that  of the  outside  to  point  out.(ﬁgure  3)
