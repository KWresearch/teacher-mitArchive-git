Assignment  11:  Poynting  Vectors;  Electromagnetic  Waves  Continued 

1.  Wave  polarization:  An  Electromagnetic  wave  is  the  superposition  of   two  linearly  po(cid:173)
larized  waves   along  the  ˆ
z  directions  and  is  described  by  the   following   equation: 
y  and  ˆ

�
zE0 cos(ω t  −  kx). 
E  =  yE0 sin(ω t  −  kx) +  ˆ

(a) What  is  the  direction  of  propagation  of this  wave?  
(b) Describe  the  wave’s  polarization. 
(c)   Find  the  magnitude  of  the  electric  ﬁeld  at  all  points  of  space  for  all  times. 
(d) An  observer  stands   at  the   origin  of the   coordinate  system. 
(e) What  is  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  B ?

where,  ω/k  =  c.

(a) Show  that   �E  obeys  all  four  of  Maxwell’s  equations,  in  vacuum,  and  ﬁnd  the  asso(cid:173)
ciated  magnetic  ﬁeld.  
(b)  Calculate  the  Poynting  vector.  Average  �S  over  a  full  cycle  to  get  the  intensity 
vector  I�. 
(c) Integrate  I� ·  d�a  over  a  spherical  surface   to  determine   the  total  power  radiated. 

3.  Poynting   vector   and  capacitor:  A  current  I  =  dQ/dt   delivers  charge  to  a  capacitor. 
This   capacitor   has  radius  a,  and  the   plates  are  separated  by  a  distance  s. 
(a)Find  the  Poynting  vector  due  to  the  electric  ﬁeld  and  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  between 
the  capacitor   plates.  Give   both  the   magnitude  and  the  direction. 
�  �
(b) Calculate  the  total  power,  P  =  S  ·  d�a,  ﬂowing  into   the  capacitor.  Given  the 
Poynting   vector   found  in  (a),  what  is  the  correct  surface  to  use  for  the   integral?  
(c)Integrate  this   power  over   time. Assuming that  the  capacitor  has  charge  0 at  t  = 0 
and  has  some  charge  level  Q  at  a   later  time  t,  show   that  the  total  energy  that  ﬂows 
into  the  capacitor   is  given  by  U  =  Q2/2C . 

4.  Poynting   vector   and  coaxial  cable: 

A  coaxial  cable  transmits  DC  power  from  a  battery  to  a  load.  The  cable  consists  of 
two  concentric,  long,  hollow  cylinders  of  zero  resistance.  The  inner  cylinder  has  radius 
a,  the  outer  has  b,  and the  length of   both  is  l. The   battery  provides  an  EMF  E  between 
the  two  conductors  at  one  end  of   the  cable,  and  the  load   is  a  resistance  R  connected 
between  the  two  conductors  at  the   other  end. 

(a) How  much  power  is  dissipated  in  the  resistor? 
(b) What  are  �
E  and  �
B  in  the   cable? 

(c)   What  is   the  Poynting  vector  �S  in  the   cable? 
(d) Show  that  �  �S  ·  d�a  =  P [from  part  (a)]. 
(e)   Suppose  the  battery  is  now  reversed.  Does  the  direction  of  �S  change? 

5.  Radiation   of  from  the   Sun.  At  top  of   the  atmosphere  the  average  radiant  ﬂux  from 
the  Sun  is  N  = 1.35   ×  103W/m2 .  Although  this  radiation  consists  of  a   spectrum  of 
frequencies,  many  of  the  interesting  properties  do  not  depend  on  frequency  and  can 
therefore  be  calculated  by  using  the   methods  described  for  monochromatic  waves.  (a) 
What  is  the  average  energy  density  in   the  solar  radiation  at  the  top of the  atmosphere?  
(b) What  is  the  average  momentum  density? 
(c)   What  average  force  would  the   radiation  exert  on  a  completely  absorbing  surface 
with  an  area  of   1m2  oriented  perpendicular  to  the  Earth-Sun  line? 
(d) What  is  the  average  value  of   E0  in  the   wave?

(a) Find the  inductance  per  unit  length  L0  and the   capacitance  per  unit  length   C0  in  
terms  of  w ,s  and  constants. 
(b)  One  end  of   the  transmission  line  is  driven  by  a  voltage  V (t) =   V0f (zk  −  ω t),  Find 
the  electric  and  magnetic  ﬁelds  �
E  and  �
B  and  the  Poynting  vector  �
S  in  terms  of  w ,  s 
and  V0  and  constants.  (c)  Find  the  impedance  Z  of  the  waveguide   in  terms  of  w ,  s 
and/or   V0  and  constants. 
(d)  At  z=10cm  from  the  driven  end  of  the  waveguide,  the  waveguide  changes   to   width 
w  +  Δw  (Δw  ≪  w),  and  separation  s  +  Δs  ≪  s).   What  is  the  impedance  Z ′  of  the 
waveguide  for  z  >  10cm?  Use  a  Taylor  expansion  to   express   your  answer  as   a  linear 
function  as  Δs  and  Δw . 
(e) How   must  Δs  and  Δw  be   related  in  order  for  Z ′  =  Z ? 

7.   Review  Problem:  Conductivity 

A  cylindrical  glass  rod   is  heated  with  a  torch   until  it  conducts  enough   current  to   cause 
a  lightbulb to  glow. It   has  a  length  L,  a  radius  r,  and  its  ends  are   connected to  copper 
wires.  When   red   hot,  its  conductivity   varies  with  position   x   measured  from   the  center 

of  the  rod  as  σ(x) =   σ0L4/x4 . 
(a) What  is  the  resistance  of this  rod? 
(b) When  a  voltage  v  is  applied  between  the  two  ends,  what  is  the  current 
density  J�(x),  and  what  is   the  steady-state  electric  ﬁeld  �E (x)? 
(c)   In  steady   state,  what  is   the  volume  charge  density  ρ(x)  found  within   the   rod?
