Assignment  6:  Equivalence  of  fields;  Magnetic  Potential;  Biot-Savart  law

Due  date:  Friday,  Oct  29th 

1.  Purcell  6.4   Magnetic   ﬁeld  of   a   hairpin  shaped  wire. 

2.  Purcell  6.13  Helmholtz  coil. 

3.  Purcell  6.22  Magnetic  Moment. 

4.  Purcell  6.33  Field  of  moving  charges. 

5.  Magnetic  ﬁeld. 

(a) Find the  magnetic  ﬁeld at  the   center  of a  square  loop,  which carries  a   steady current 
I .  Let  R  be  the  distance  from  center  to   side. 

(b)  Find  the  ﬁeld  at  the   center  of  a  regular  n-sided  polygon,  carrying  a  steady  current 
I .  Again,  let  R  be  the  distance   from  the   center  to  any  side. 

(c)   Check  that  your  formula  reduces  to  the  ﬁeld  at  the  center  of  a   circular  loop,  in  the  
limit  of  large  n. 

6.  Vector  potential  of  an  inﬁnite  solenoid. 

Find  the  vector  potential  of  an  inﬁnite  solenoid   with  n  turns  per  unit  length,  radius 
R,  and  current  I . (Hint:  it  is  a   bit  hard to  use   Eq 35.  of  Purcell,  since  the  solenoid  is 
inﬁnitely  long   here.  Try  thinking   of

where  φ  is  the  magnetic  ﬂux  of   ~B  through the  loop in  question.) 

7.  Transformation  of  ﬁelds:  A   very  large  sheet  of   charge  lies  in  the  x  − y  plane  of  the 
frame  F . The  charge  per  unit area   of this  sheet  is  σ . In  the  frame   F  ′ ,  this  sheet  moves 
to  the  right   with  speed  v . 

(a) What  is  the  electric  ﬁeld  in  the  rest  frame  (above  and  below  the  sheet)?  

(b) What  is  the  electric  ﬁeld  in  the  frame  F  ′  (above  and  below  the  sheet)? 

(c) What  is  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  in  the   frame  F  ′  (above  and  below  the   sheet)? 

(d)  Show  that   the  results   of  (b)  and  (c)  are  consistent  with  the  general  Lorentz  trans(cid:173)
formations  for  electric  and  magnetic  ﬁelds,  Eq.  (60)  of   Purcell  Chapter  6. 

8.  Electric  and  magnetic  forces. 

Two   inﬁnite  lines   of  charges  with  charge  per  unit  length  λ0  in  their  rest  frame  are  
separated  by  a  distance  d.  These  charges  are   moving   in  a  direction  parallel  to  their 
length  with  speed  v . 

(a) In  the  rest  frame,  what   is  the  electric  force  per  unit  length  that  the  top  line   feels 
due  to  the  bottom  line?  Give   both  the  direction  and  the  magnitude. 

(b) Repeat  (a) in  the  lab  frame.  

(c) In  the  lab  frame,  what  is  the  magnetic  force  per  unit  length that  the   top line  feels  
due  to  the  bottom  line?  Give   both  the  direction  and  the  magnitude. 

(d) What   is  the  total  force  per  unit  length  in  the  lab  frame?
