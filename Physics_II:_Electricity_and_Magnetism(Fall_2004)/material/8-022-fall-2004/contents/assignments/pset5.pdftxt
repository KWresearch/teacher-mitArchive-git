1.  Lorentz  invariance  (10  pts).  A  quantity  that  is  left  unchanged  by  Lorentz  transforma(cid:173)
tions  is  a  called  a   “Lorentz  invariant”. 
a)Consider   two  events  described  in  the  laboratory  frame  by  (t1 , x1 , y1 , z1) and  (t2 , x2 , y2 , z2). 
Show  that 

Δs 2  =  −(cΔt)2 +  (Δx)2 +  (Δy )2 +  (Δz)2 . 

is  a  Lorentz  invariant. 

b)Energy-momentum  identity.  Show   that

where  p =  |~p|  is  Lorentz  invariant.

of  a  moving  frame  F ′ .  Frame   F ′  moves  with  speed  v  in  the   +x  direction  with  respect 
to  the  laboratory frame  F . 
(a)  Find  the  angle  that   the  velocity  vector  makes  with  x  axis  of  the  lab  frame.  
(b) What   is  this  angle  in  the  limit  | ~ | =  c?  Does  anything  weird  happen?

(c) Show  that   when  | ~ |  =  c,  |~u| =  c  –  the  speed  of   light  is  the   same   in  both  frames.

3.  Galilean  tranformations   (10  pts):  Prior  to  special relativity,  people  related coordinates  
between  diﬀerent  frames  with the  “Galilean  transformation”  – clocks  in  diﬀerent  refer(cid:173)
ence  frame  tick  at   the  same  rate,  spatial  positions  are   shifted  by  a  term  that  depends 
on  the  relative  velocity  just  as  you  would  expect.  For  example,  for  frames  that  are 
moving  with  respect  to  each  other  in  the  x  direction,  we   would  have 

t ′  = 
t 
x ′  =  x −  v t  

(3) 

Using the  binomial expansion  on  γ ,  show   that  for  small  v/c the  Lorentz  tranformations 
reduce  to  the  Galilean  tranformations.  At  what  value  of  v  does  the   next  term  in  the 
expansion  change  the  x  transformation  by 1%? 

4.  Relativistic  collisions  (15   pts).  A  particle  of   rest  mass  m1  and  velocity  v1  collides  with 
a  stationary  particle  of  rest   mass  m2  and  is  absorbed   by  it.  What  is  the   velocity  and 
the  rest   mass  of  the  ﬁnal  compound  system? 

5.  “Beating the  speed of  light” (15  pts). A  friend of  yours  says  he  can  beat  the   speed of  
light. His  idea  is  as  follows. He  will  make  a  cart roll across  the  ﬂoor  with  speed  v .  and 

then  puts  a  smaller  cart   on  top  of  that  cart,  and  roll  it  with  speed  v with  respect  to 
the  ﬁrst   cart,  and  in  the  same  direction  as  the  ﬁrst  cart.  he  puts  a  third  cart  on  this  
second cart; it rolls   with speed  v with respect  to  the  second cart. He  puts  a  fourth cart 
...  you  get  the  idea.  He  claims  that  there  is  some  n at  which  the  cart  must  be  going 
faster  than  the  speed  of  light. 
(a)  Prove  him  wrong.  Using  mathematical  induction,  prove  that  if  v < c,  then  v n  < c, 
where  v n  is  the  velocity  of   the   nth  cart.  Show  that  this  holds  even  for  extremely  large 
n. 
(b) Calculate  the  value  of  v n  given  v and  n. 

6.  Purcell  6.13   Helmholtz  coil  (15  pts). 

7.  Ampere’s  law  (15  pts).  A  steady  current  I ﬂows  down  a  long   cylindrical  wire  of  radius 
a.  Find  the  magnetic  ﬁeld,  both  inside   and  outside  the  wire   if 
a)  The  current   is  uniformly  distributed  over  the  outside  surface  of  the  wire. 
b)  The  current  is  distributed  in  such  a  way  that  J is  proportional  to  s,  the  distance 
from  the  axis. 

8.  Fields  of  a   thick  sheet  (10   pts).
