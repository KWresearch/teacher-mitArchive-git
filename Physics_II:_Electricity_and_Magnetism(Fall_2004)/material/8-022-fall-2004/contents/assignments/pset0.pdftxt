(Note that the symbol  ≡  means “is equivalent to" or “is defined as". The symbol  ∇ 
is 
the gradient operator or “del” operator; some of you may already be familiar with it. 
The rest of you will be very soon!)

(a) Suppose we work in SI units: the coordinates (x,y) are measured in meters, so that the 
particle moves l meters along each leg of the path; the force is measured in Newton. 
What must be the units of A? Express in terms of kg, m, and s. 
(b) Suppose we work in cgs units: the coordinates (x, y) are measured in centimeters, and 
the force is measured in dynes. What must be the units of A? Express in terms of g, 
cm, and s. 

(c) How much work does the force do when the particle travels around the path? (Your 
answer does not depend on the choice of units: express it in terms of the constants A 
and l, which are assumed to have units built into them). Is this a conservative force? 

(d) If we place a particle right at the origin, since the total force is zero, the particle will 
just stay there. Is this a stable situation? Give any argument  (mathematical, physical, 
intuitive) to justify the stability (or instability) of this situation. 

4.  Multidimensional integrals (20 pt)  

You wish to calculate the magnitude of the electric potential a distance z on axis above a 
circular disk that carries surface charge densityσ In a few weeks you will learn that the 
general formula for the potential in this situation is 
σ
φ= ∫  dA 
r 
where the integral is taken over the disk, and r is the distance from an element on the disk 
to the “field point" on the axis. Let us set up the integral in Cartesian coordinates. 

(a) What is the area element dA? 

(b) What is the distance r? 

(c) How many integrals do you need? 

(d) What are their limits of integration? Write out the integral. (Do not evaluate it though) 

Now let us now set up the integral in cylindrical coordinates. 

(e) What is the area element dA? 

(f) What is the distance r? 

(g) How many integrals do you need? What are their limits of integration? 

(h) Evaluate the integral. 

5.  Expansions (20 pt) 

(a) Take the answer you got for 3(h) and evaluate the result in the limit of large z. 
Keep only terms that go as 1=z. Given that σ times πb is the total charge on the disk,

interpret your answer. 

In a certain problem (which you'll see soon enough...), you work out a formula with 
the following dependence on the parameters l1 and l2 and the variable D: 
) = ln( l1  + D ) + ln( 
l 2  + D  )

( 
l1  + l 2  + D

(b) Show that, for large D,  D 
f 
) is proportional to D 2 .
