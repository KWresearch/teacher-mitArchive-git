1.  Purcell  8.9:  Eﬀects  of  resistance  on  RLC  frequency.  Note,  Q  =  ∞  corresponds  to 
R  = 0.  Also  the  percentage  change   is  just  the  fractional  change,

times  100. 

2.  Purcell  8.10  RL  in  parallel  in  C. 

3.  Purcell  8.16  An  inﬁnite  L-C  ladder. 

4. Quality factor   details. 

(a) For   the  series  RLC  circuit,  show   that  the  frequencies  ω1 and  ω2 at which the   average  
power  provided  by the  source  is  half the  maximum  are  given  by:

(b)  Show  that   the  AC  quality  factor

is  the  same  as   the  quality  factor  obtained  for  the  dumped  RLC   circuit.

Figure   1:  Two  capacitors  and  an  inductor. 

Consider  the   following circuit where   C1  is  initially charged to  75V.  Supposed that   C1  is 
10,000  µF , C2 is 3000 µF,  and L  is  15H. 
Explain  how  to   open  and close   the  switches  so  as  to  discharge  C1  and  charge  C2 . 
Starting   at  t  =  0,  you  should  give  explicitly   times  for   opening  and 
closing  each  switch.  What  is  the  ﬁnal  voltage  across  C2 

6.  Betatron  accelerator. 

A  particle  of  mass  M  and  charge   Q  is  constrained  by  a  magnetic   ﬁeld  B0 (R) to  move 
on  a  circle  of  radius   R  which  is  perpendicular  to  the   ﬁeld.  While  B0(r)  is  constant 
in  angle  around  a  circle,  the  magnitude  B0  may  depend  on  the  radius.  then   one  can 
deﬁne  an  average  ﬁeld  Bav  within  the  R-circle  by; 
�  R
0 
In  the  betatron  B0(R)  can  be  increased  with  time.  At  t=0,  B0 (R)  is  very  small  and 
particles  from  an  ion  source  are  injected  with  a  low  velocity  just  suﬃcient  to  follow 
a  circular  path.  Then   both  Bav  and  B0 (R)  are  increased  with  time,  accelerating  the 
particle  by Faraday induction  and  keeping  it  on  a   circular  orbit  by the  Lorentz  force.

(a) Find the  force  on  the  charge  Q due  to   the  changing  ﬁeld. 
(b)  Find  the  speed  of  the  particle   in  its  orbit  as  a  function  of  Bav (t) 
(c)   The  particle  will stay  in  the   orbit of radius  R so  long as  B0(r) and the   speed  v  have 
the  correct  relation.  However  for  the   accelerator  to  work  at  all  speeds,  Bav  and   B0 (R) 
must  have  the  proper   relationship.  What  is  this  relationship?  Can  it  be  satisﬁed  by  a 
uniform  B0 
′  ,  that  is,  one  which  does  not  depend  on  r? 
(This   problem  is   not very closely related to  this  chapter,  but  it  illustrated an  important 
principal.)  

7.  NB: the solenoid is positioned in such a way that its axis is perpendicular to the page 
and to the plane of the circuit. Not obvious from the picture…
