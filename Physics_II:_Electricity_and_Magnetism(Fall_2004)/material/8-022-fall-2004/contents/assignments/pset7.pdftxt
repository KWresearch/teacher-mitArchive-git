Assignment  7:  Faraday’s  law;  Inductance 
Due  date:  Friday,  Nov  5th 

1.  Faraday’s  Law. 

A  long   solenoid,  of  radius  a,  is  driven  by an  alternating current,  so  that  the  ﬁeld  inside 
is  sinusoidal:   ~
B (t) =   B0cos(ω t) ˆ
z .  A  circular  loop  of  wire,  of  radius  a/2  and  resistance 
R,  is  placed  inside  the   solenoid,  and  coaxial  with  it.  Find  the  current  induced  in  the 
loop,  as   a  functioin  of time. 

2.  Purcell  7.11  Mutual  and  self  induction  of  coils. 

3.  Purcell  7.14  A  metal  crossbar  in  the  magnetic  ﬁeld. 

4.  Purcell  7.17  LR  circuits. 

5.  Purcell  7.21  Mutual  inductance   of  coaxial  solenoids. 

6.  Purcell  7.22  Angular  momentum  and  electromagnetic  ﬁelds. 

7.  Toroidal  coil. 

Using two  approaches   to  ﬁnd the   self-induction  of a  toroidal coil with rectangular  cross  
section  (inner  radius  a,  outer  radius  b,  height  h),  which  carries  a  total  of  N  turns. 

8.  Second  Derivatives. 

Prove  the  identity: 

▽ × (▽ × A) =  ▽(▽ · A) − ▽
