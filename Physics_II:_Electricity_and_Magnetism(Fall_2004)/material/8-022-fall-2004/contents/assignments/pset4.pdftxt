Due  date:  Friday,  Oct  15th 

1.  Purcell  4.18:  Maximum  power  of  the   battery  (10pts). 

2.  Purcell  4.21:  Th´evenin  equivalent  circuits  (10pts). 

3.  Purcell  4.31:  Resistor  cube  (15pts).  

4.  Purcell  4.32:  An  inﬁnite  network  (15pts). 

5.  Purcell  4.33:  Minimum  power  dissipation  (10pts). 

6.  Conservation   of  energy  and  RC circuits  (10pts). 

Consider  the  simplest   RC  circuit.  Suppose  that  a  charge  Q0  is  stored  on  the  capacitor 
initially. Show  that   the  total energy dissipated  in  the  resistor  after  the  switch  is  closed 
equals  the  energy   that  was  stored  before  the   switch  was  closed.

7.  Circuit  network  (15pts). 

Consider  the  following   circuit: 

Suppose  that  the  capacitor  is  initially  discharged.  The  switch  is  closed  at  t  =  0.  ﬁnd 
the  current   IB (t) through the  battery  (i.e.,  in  the  middle  branch) as  a   function  of time, 
and the  charge  on  the   capacitor  Q(t). 

8.  Electric  potential,   charge  density,  and  Taylor  expansion  (15pts).
