Hint for Problem 3, Pset 6. 

vdt 

P 

A line charge λ traveling down a wire at speed v constitutes a current 
I  = λ v 
Because a segment of length vdt, carrying charge λ vdt, passing point P in a time interval 
dt,. Current is  

dq 
dt 

I  = 

= λ v

Force on a line segment is 
dq v × B = 
λ dl 
dF = 
c
c 
Since I and dl both point in the same direction,  
I
dF =  dl × B 
c 

v × B = 

dl
c 

I × B
