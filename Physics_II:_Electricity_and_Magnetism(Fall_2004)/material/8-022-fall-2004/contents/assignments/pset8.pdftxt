6.  Charge  in  series  RLC. 

In  this  problem,  we  will  look  at  the  behavior  of  q(t),  the  charge  on  the   capacitor  in  a 
series   RLC  circuit   driven  by  a  periodic  EMF   E  =  E0 cos(ω t). 

(a)  Derive  a   diﬀerential   equation  showing  the  time  evolution  of  the  charge  on  the  ca-
pacitor. Don’t  solve  it! 

dq 
(b)  Use  the  known  solution  for  I(t)  and  the  deﬁnition  I  =  dt  to  ﬁnd  an  expression  for 
q(t).  Give  the  complex  charge,  ˜q(t),  as  well  as  the   physical  charge   on  the  capacitor. 
What  is  the  amplitude  q0  of  q(t)? 

� 
(c) Show  that  the  maximum  charge   amplitude   is  at  ω  =  ω 2 −  R2/2L2 
0

(a)  What  is  the  complex  impedance  of  the  combination  of  the  circuit  elements,  R, 
L,  and  C  shown   in  Fig  1?  The  AC  voltage  is  given  as  V0cos(ω t) Please  rationalize 

the  expressiion  into  separate  real  and  imaginary  parts. (Note:  impedance  in  parallel 
behave  in  just  the  same   way  as  resistor  in  parallel.) 
(b)  What  is   the  current  I,  (the   actual  and  not  the  complex  current)  ﬂowing   through 
the  circuit?  Give  an  expression  for  the  phase   angle. 
(c)Explain  the  low  and  high  frequency  behavior  of  the  phase  shift  of  the  current  in 
terms  of  the  currents  through  each   of  the  circuit  elements. 

8.  Levitating  ring   demonstration. 

Figure  2:  Sideview  of the   loop in  the  B  ﬁeld. 

A conducting circular  loop of radius  a  is  levitated  by a  magnetic   ﬁeld  (created  by a  coil 
which  is  not   shown).   the  loop  is  centered  on  the  axis  of  symmetry  of  the  coil,  so   you 
may  consider  the  component  of  the  ﬁeld  pointing  radially  outwards  from  the   center  of 
the  loop,  Br ,  as  being  constant  around  the  loop.   Two  cases  are   sonsidered  here.  First 
you  will  consider  what  happens  when  the  ﬁeld  strength  is  increased  at a  constant  rate. 
Second,  you   will  determine   what  happens  in  the  AC  case. 

(a)  If   the  ﬁeld   strength  is  increasing  at  a  constant  reate,  a  current  will  start  to  ﬂow  in 
the  loop.  Draw  a  diagram   of  the  “top  view”  to  show  the  direction  of  the  current. 

(b)  The  increasing  magnetic   ﬁeld  creates  an  increasing  magnetic  ﬂux  dφ/dt  through 
the  loop. The  inductance  of the  loop   is  L,  and the  resistance  of the  loop  R.  Write  down 
the  correct  diﬀerential  equation  describing  the  current  ﬂow  in  the  loop.  Your  equation 
should  incolve  dφ 
dI 
dt  ,  dt  ,I,  L,R and  c. (Besides  the   external  magnetic  ﬂux,  the  current  will 
also  produce  a  magnetic  ﬂux  through  the  loop.) 

(c)   Write  down  the  value  for  the   current  around  the  loop  as  t  → ∞. 

(d)  Now  consider   that   the   magnetic   ﬁeld   oscillates  in  time.  This  means  that  the  ﬂux 
through  the  loop  oscillates  as  φ  =  φ0cos(ω t).   What  is  the  current  in  the  loop?  What 
is  the  phase  of   the  current   compared  to  the  phase  of  the  ﬂux?  (Hint:  Use   complex  

˜
˜
φ
number   and  note  that  φ  =  Re[φ0 eiωt ] =  Re[φ].Also  use  the  fact  that  d
dt 

=  iωφ˜. 

(e) What  is  the  force  on  the  loop?  Which way  does  it  point?  Use  the   expression  for  the 
current   that  you  derived  in  part  (d).  Remember  that  the   magnetic  ﬁeld  is  oscillating 
so  that  Bz  oscillates  as  Bz  =  Bz0 cos(ω t)  and  Br  oscillates  as  Br  =  Br0cos(ω t).  For 
what  value  of  hte  resistance  is  the  force  maximized?
