  First attempt:  
 Charge density λ0  = Q/L where L = length of the wire in Lab frame 
  In lab frame: λ−
ΜΟΤ  = Q/L= -λ0 
  In O (in rest with - charges), length of wire appears contracted: L’:L/γ 
REST  > λ −
REST  = Q/L’= Qγ/L= -γλ0  Æ λ− 
Æ λ− 
WRONG! 
ΜΟΤ
Why? There is no such thing as the wire. Just the length of + and – charges which 
happen to be the same in the Lab reference frame but not elsewhere. 
  Second attempt: 
  The electrons will think: our length in our own RF is L’-. In the 
reference frame of the lab, boosted wrt us by a velocity –v, this 
length will be contracted by a factor γ: L’-= γL

Thoughts on this problem 

	 Is the comparison fair? 
  In one RF we have a magnetic force, in the other an electric force 
  Are we comparing apples and oranges? 
	 No, on the contrary! 
	 This results proves that Electricity and Magnetism are intimately 
connected! 
	 Physics is consistent! 
  Principle of relativity demands that the 2 observers will come to 
the same conclusions 
  The details of the calculation (Electric? Magnetic?) are different in 
the different RF, but ultimately irrelevant.
