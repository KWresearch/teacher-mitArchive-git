Magnetic properties of materials 

We went through the whole E&M course without even understanding 
how a magnet bar works? 
Yes, so far. Let’s try to make up for this… 
☺ 
Very qualitative description: as far as we can go without quantum since 

(cid:132) 

(cid:132) 

Magnetic properties of materials are totally determined 
by quantum mechanical nature of their molecular structure 

In the discussion I assume we are al fami ar with some basic 
li
l 
properties of electrons and atoms 
Nucleus at the center, electrons rotating on orbits 
Electron is negatively charged 
Electron has an intrinsic angular momentum (spin)

Electrons in atoms produce magnetic field

There are lots of electrons, orbits are randomly oriented: 
cancellation 
What happens when we put the material in an external B? 
Lentz’s law: the orbits rearrange so that the magnetic fie
ld created 
by the orbits opposes the external magnetic field  
Net effect: the total magnetic field will be weaker

Effects due to electron’s spin


(cid:132)	 The intrinsic magnetic moment behaves very differently from the 
standard magnetic moment 
(cid:132)	 No Lentz’s law type behavior because this field is associated with the 
electron itself 
(cid:132)  What happens when we put the material in an external B? 
(cid:132)  A magnetic moment µ  placed in an external filed B feels a torque 
(cid:71)

(cid:132)	 See Purcell 6.22

What effect is stronger?  


(cid:132)  Summary of the situation so far: 
(cid:132)  Lentz’s law on the orbit of the electrons opposes B fields from entering 
material 
(cid:132)  Magnetic torque acting on individual electrons augments the B field in 
the material 
(cid:132)  Opposite behaviors! Who wins? 
(cid:132)  It depends on the properties of the material (chemical structure, how 
free electrons are, etc) 
(cid:132)  3 categories: 
(cid:132)  Diamagnetic materials 
(cid:132)  Paramagnetic materials 
(cid:132)  Ferromagnetic materials

Diamagnetic materials 


(cid:132)  Diamagnetic materials defined as materials in which the magnetization 
opposes the external magnetic field 
(cid:132)  When material is immersed in external B field, magnetic field inside the material 
is weaker than external B 
(cid:132)  Lentz’s law wins out on effect of spin 
(cid:132)  Diamagnetism is usually very weak and hard to see 
(cid:132)  Lentz’s law plays a role in all materials. Spin effect (if present) are stronger (cid:198)if 
preset it usually covers completely diamagnetic behavior 
(cid:132)  Examples of diamagnetic materials 
(cid:132)  Typically orbits filled with paired electron (cid:198)  orbit has no net magnetic moment 
(cid:132)  Most substances: H20, Cu, NaCl, etc 
(cid:132)  Consequence: diamagnetic substances will be expelled from B field

Paramagnetic materials 


(cid:132)	 Paramagnetic materials are defined as materials in which the magnetization 
augments the external magnetic field 
(cid:132)  When material is immersed in B field, magnetic field inside the material is 
stronger than outside 
(cid:132)  Effect of Spin wins out on Lentz’s law 
(cid:132)	 Examples of diamagnetic materials 
(cid:132)  Typically have several electron orbits that contain unpaired electrons (cid:198) 
orbit has a net magnetic moment 
(cid:132)  Exception: Oxygen O2  is paramagnetic. To see this property need to cool it to a liquid 
state, or random motion will wipe out effect 
(cid:132)	 Example: Na, Al, NiSO4, etc 
(cid:132)  Consequence: Paramagnetic materials are pulled into magnetic fields 
If paramagnetic behavior is “extra strong”: Ferromagnetic material

Magnetic susceptibility  


(cid:132)	 Many substances exhibit linear magnetization, e.g. the 
magnetization depends linearly on the external field applied 
(cid:71)
(cid:71) 
H = χ Mm 
(cid:132)	 Where χ m= magnetic susceptibility 
(cid:71)
(cid:71) 
(cid:71) 
(cid:132)	 Since  B = H + 4π M it follows that  
(cid:71)
(cid:71) 
B = H(1 + 4πχ m)

(cid:132)	 Classification of material based on magnetic susceptibility 
(cid:132)	 χ m<0: magnetic field B decreases when we immerse the substance in 
an external magnetic field B: diamagnetism 
(cid:132)  χ m>0: magnetic field B increases when we immerse the substance in 
an external magnetic field B: paramagnetism

Ferromagnetism


(cid:132)  “Ferromagnetism is paramagnetism on steroids” 
Prof. S. Hughes – 8.022 S-2004 
(cid:132)  Nonlinearity distinguishes it from paramagnetism 
(cid:132)  M and H do not have a simple linear relation 
(cid:132)  Magnetization remains after external field is turned off 
(cid:132)  This is how permanent magnets work! 
(cid:132)  Why nonlinear behavior? 
(cid:132)  Way beyond scope of 8.022 
(cid:132)  But it’s easy enough to describe qualitatively how it works…

Ferromagnetic domains 
Ferromagnetism is conceptually sim lar to paramagnetism 
i
Difference: magnetic moments of many atoms are tend to be aligned 
ons (domains) 
in small regi
Paramagnetic materials: moments are randomly arranged until external B 
aligns them 
Since domains are small (0.1 mm – few mm) and randomly oriented: 
overall M=0 
When material is put into externa  B, domains re-a gn // to B 
li
l
When external B is removed they stay aligned: permanent magnets!

8.022 – Lecture 22

Sizes of domains range from a 0.1 mm to a few mm. When an external magnetic 
field is applied, the domains already aligned in the direction of this field grow at the 
expense of their neighbors. If all the spins were aligned in a piece of iron, the field 
would be about 2.1 Tesla. A magnetic field of about 1 T can be produced in 
annealed iron with an external field of about 0.0002 T, a multiplication of the 
external field by a factor of 5000! 
Barkhausen effect: 
Domains are well modeled by the compass table, an array of about 
one hundred small compass needles used for showing fields of bar 
magnets, etc. When there is no strong external Bfield, sections of 
the array line up in different directions, each individual compass 
needle aligning itself with the local field. When the array is tapped 
sharply, it will be seen that the needles on the boundaries of the 
domains are the least stable (vibrate the most), and some of them 
realign causing one domain to grow at the expense of another. 
In the Barkhausen effect, a large coil of fine wire is connected 
through an amplifier to a speaker. When an iron rod is placed 
within the coil and stroked with a magnet, an audible roaring 
sound will be produced from the sudden realignments of the 
magnetic domains within the rod. A copper rod, on the other hand, 
produces no effect.

(cid:132) 

(cid:132) 

(cid:132)

In ferromagnetic materials B and H have a nonlinear dependence 
Let’s find out experimentally what that is

ferromagnetic material 
Start with value of H (H ), decrease to 0, flip the direction and reach –H
