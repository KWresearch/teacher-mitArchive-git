Abstract 

This  write-up  summarizes  the  derivation  and  use  of  the  Lorentz 
transformation  to  relate  two  inertial  frames.  The  main  results  are 
Lorentz  length  contraction  and  the  time  dilation.  The  derivation  of 
the  way  of  adding  velocities  is  also  given. 

Inertial  Frames  and  Einstein’s  Postulate 

Inertial  frames  are  frames  related  by  a  constant  velocity  along  any  axis.  An 
ob ject  is  at  rest  in  an  inertial  frame  when  its  position  in  space  does  not 
change  with  time.  We  consider  two  inertial  frames:  the  26-100  (S ) frame  in 
which  we  are  at  rest  and  the  Space  Shuttle  frame  (S (cid:1)
) which  moves  relative 
to  S  with  a  velocity  u  along  the  x  axis  and  in  which  the  Shuttle  is  at  rest. 
Newton postulated that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames; 
speciﬁc  predictions  made  in  one  frame must  also  be  true  in  all  other  inertial 
frames. 

Based on the result of the Michelson-Morley experiment, Einstein postulated: 
There   is   a   universal   constant,   c,   which   is   the   same   in   al l   inertial   frames. This 
velocity  corresponds  to  the  velocity  of  light,  c = 3 × 1010  cm/s.  We will  now 
investigate  the  implications  of  Einstein’s  postulate. 

Galilean Transformation 

Let the coordinates (x, t) denote the  location of an event  in  the 26-100 frame 
and  (x , t(cid:1)
(cid:1)
)  denote  the  location  of  the  same  event  in  the  Shuttle  frame.  The 
Galilean  transformation  which  relates  the  two  coordinate  systems  is: 

x  =  x − ut 
(cid:1) 
(cid:1) 
y  =  y 
(cid:1) 
z  =  z 
(cid:1) 
t =  t 

(1) 

which tells us we just need to take  into account the relative translation of the 
coordinate  systems  to  transform  the  coordinates  of  a  given  event  from  one 
frame  to  another.  Suppose  a  body moves  with  velocity  v (cid:1)  inside  the  Shuttle. 
What velocity  v  do we  in  26-100 see  it move with?  Using  the  transformation 
Eq.  1  from  Shuttle  coordinates  to  26-100  coordinates  gives: 
(cid:1)  + ut(cid:1) 
x  =  x 
→ dx  =  dx(cid:1)  + udt(cid:1) 
dx(cid:1) 
dt(cid:1) 
→ 
dx 
(cid:1)  + u 
=  v = 
dt(cid:1)  = v 
dt(cid:1)  + u 
dt 

This  just  says  we  in  26-100  see  the  body  moving  with  the  velocity  v (cid:1)  it  has 
in  the  shuttle  frame  plus  the  velocity  of  the  Shuttle  frame  (u)  with  respect 
to  26-100.  If   Einstein’s   postulate   that   the   velocity   of   light   is   the   same   in   al l  
inertial   frames   (based   on   the   result   of   the   Michelson-Morley   experiment)   is  
correct,  then  the  Galilean  transformation  is  not  the  correct  way  to  transform 
space-time   coordinates   between   two   inertial   frames.

Derivation   of   the   Lorentz   Transformation  

We  wish  to  ﬁnd  a  transformation  between  the  26-100  frame  (S ) and  the 
Shuttle  frame (S (cid:1)
) which  such  that  the velocity  of  light  c  is  the  same  in both 
coordinate  systems.  The  most  general  linear  transformation  (i.e.  depending 
on  x  and  t  ,  but  not  higher  powers  like  x2 , etc.)  1  is: 
(cid:1) 
x  =  Ax + B t 
(cid:1)  =  y 
y 
(cid:1)  =  z 
z 
t(cid:1)  =  Dx + E t 

(3) 

(2) 

remember  the  velocity  u  is  along  the  x-axis,  so  the  other  coordinates  must 
(cid:1) 
remain  the same:  y (cid:1)  = y , z = z .  We have chosen  at x = x(cid:1)  = 0 at  t = t(cid:1)  = 0. 
The  origin  of  the  S (cid:1)  frame  (x(cid:1)  =  0)  moves  along  the  tra jectory  x  =  −ut  in 
the  S  frame.  Putting  this  into  the  Eq.  2  above  gives 
0 = Aut + B t → B = −Au → x 
(cid:1)  = A(x − ut). 
In  the  frame  S (cid:1)  the  origin  (x = 0)  of  S  describes  a  tra jectory  along  x(cid:1)  = ut(cid:1) 
and  putting  this  into  equation  Eq.  2  above  gives  −ut(cid:1)  = A(x − ut). 
Substituting  this result  into Eq. 3 gives −u(Dx + E t) = A(x − ut) and x = 0 
implies  −uE t = −Aut → E  = A. Now  we  have 
x  =  A(x − ut) 
(cid:1) 
(cid:1) 
t =  Dx + At. 

(4) 
(5) 

Next,  we  apply  Einstein’s  Postulate:  The   velocity   of   light   is   the   same   in   al l  
inertial   frames.   A  pulse  of  light  emitted  at  t(cid:1)  = 0  along  the  x(cid:1)  axis  in  the  S (cid:1) 
frame  follows  the  tra jectory  x(cid:1)  = ct(cid:1) .  We  use  this  to  relate  Eqs.  4  and  5: 
A(x − ut) =  c(Dx + At). 
1 It   can   be   shown   that   transformations   involving   terms   like   x2  lead   to   transformations  
which are  not  invariant  for  translations  of the  coordinate  systems. 

(6)

The  same  pulse  of  light  would  be  seen  as  following  the  tra jectory  x  =  ct  in 
the  S  frame.  Use  this  to  eliminate  x  in  Eq.  6:  A(c − u)t  =  c(Dc + A)t  → 
D = −Au/c2  and we  have 

x  =  A(x − ut) 
(cid:1) 
t =  A(−  + t).

Finally, what happens  to  a  light pulse  emitted  along  the  y  axis  at  time  t = 0 
in  frame  S ?  It  follows  a  tra jectory  y  =  ct  and  x  = 0  in  frame  S  and  a 
tra jectory  x(cid:1)2  + y (cid:1)2  =  ct(cid:1)2  in  frame  S (cid:1) .  If  we  substitute  for  x
(cid:1) ,  t(cid:1)
using  Eq.  7 
and  8  and  y (cid:1)  = y = ct  , we  have:

Particle  at  rest  or  moving  at  constant  velocity 

Fig.  1  shows  the  coordinate  system  in  the  26-100  frame.  A  particle  at  rest 
at  the  point  xo  follows  a  tra jectory  in  a  coordinate  system  (called  a  world  
line)  as  shown  in  the  ﬁgure.  An  event   represents  an  occurrence  at  a  speciﬁc  
coordinate   and   time,  for  example  at  (xo , to )  in  the  ﬁgure.  Suppose  a  particle 
moves  with  velocity  u  along  the  x  axis  in  26-100  (frame  S ).  Fig.  2  shows 
the  world  line  for  a  particle  moving  in  26-100  frame  with  velocity  u  passing 
through  (xo , to ).  Now  suppose  a  particle  is  at  rest  in  the  Shuttle  (frame  S (cid:1)
) 
at  coordinate  x(cid:1)  =  0  .  To  the  people  in  the  shuttle,  the  coordinate  system 
appears  as  in  Fig.  3. 

We put  primes  to  indicate  this  is  the  rest  frame  in  the  Shuttle.  A particle  at 
rest  at  x(cid:1)  in  the  Shuttle  describes  the  world  line  shown.

Coordinate  systems 

What  does  the  Shuttle  coordinate  system  look  like  to  us  in  26-100  if  we 
arrange  for  the  shuttle  to go by  in  such  a way  that at  t = 0,  t(cid:1)  = x = x(cid:1)  = 0? 
(cid:1) 
The  x(cid:1)  axis  is  all  those  points  where  t(cid:1)  = 0,  so  to  see  what  the  x axis  looks 
like  in  the  26-100  frame,  put  t(cid:1)  = 0  into  the  Lorentz  transformations  Eq.  12:

Eliminating  x(cid:1)  gives  x  =  c2 t/u  which  is  the  equation  of  the  x axis  in  the 
26-100  coordinate  system.  The  t(cid:1)  axis  is  the  locus  of  all  points  such  that 
(cid:1)  = 0 and putting x(cid:1)  = 0  into  the Lorentz  equations and eliminating  t(cid:1)  gives

u  goes  to  c,  the  velocity  of  light? 

The   Lorentz   Contraction  

Suppose  there  is  a  2×4  2  located  of  length L  located  in  the  Shuttle  with  the 
(cid:1) 
left end located at x(cid:1)  = 0 and the right end located at x = L. At time t(cid:1)  = 0, 
the Shuttle Mission Specialist  in Wood Measuring measures the length of the 
2×4.  He  is  aided  by  a  light  on  each  end  of  the  2×4  which  ﬂash  at  the  time 
of  the  measurement,  t(cid:1)  =  0.  The  lights  deﬁne  two  events,  one  at  (0, 0)  and 
the  other  at  (L, 0)  in  the  Shuttle  rest  frame.  The  measurement  events  are 
shown  in  Fig.  5.  We  deﬁne  measuring  the  length  as  the  diﬀerence  in  spatial 
coordinates  of  two  simultaneous  events. 

In  the  26-100  frame,  we  see  the  Shuttle  come  roaring  through  26-100  at 
velocity  u  and  at  t  =  t(cid:1)  =  0  the  origin  of  the  Shuttle  coordinate  system 
corresponds  to  the  origin  of  the  26-100  coordinate  system.  We  can  use  the 
Lorentz  transformation  to  determine  the  coordinates  of  the  measurement 
events  on  board  the  Shuttle.  The  left  end  measurement  event  is  (0, 0)  in 
the Shuttle  frame and putting  into  the Lorentz  transformation gives  (0, 0)  in 
the  26-100  frame  as  well.  The  right  end  measurement  event  is  (L, 0)  in  the 
Shuttle  frame  and  the  Lorentz  transformation  to  the  26-100  frame  gives

Notice   that   it   appears   to   us   in   the   26-100   frame that   the   measurement   of   the  
right   end   appears   to   have   been   made   later   than   the   measurement   of   the   left  
end   while   on   the   Shuttle   they   were   both   made   at   t(cid:1)  =  0.  Diagrammatically, 
the  situation  in  the  26-100  frame  appears  as  in  Fig.  6. 
In the 26-100 frame, we measure the length of the 2×4 at t = 0 .  The left end 
coincides  with  the  origin  at  t = 0  .  The  right  end  follows  along  a  world  line

with slope 1/u and crosses through the point (L/  1 − u2/c2 , uL/  1 − u2/c2), 
� 
so  the  world  line  for  the  right  hand  end  in  the  26-100  coordinates  is  t  = 
x/u − L  1 − u2/c2/u.  If  we  in  the  26-100  frame  measure  the  length  of  the 
� 
2×4 at  t  =  0,  we  ﬁnd  the  length  to  be  L  1 − u2/c2 , which  is  shorter   by  a 
� 
factor  1 − u2/c2  than  the  length  in  the  Shuttle  frame,  in  which  the  2×4 is 
at  rest. 

Some  numbers:  the  Shuttle  orbits  the  earth  every  90  minutes  at  a  distance 
of 148 million km, which  gives  an average  velocity  of u = 7 × 105  cm/s.  This 
gives a contraction of L(1 − 2 × 10
−10  ), so a 1 meter long 2×4 would appear in 
the  26-100  frame  to  be  only  shorter,  about  5  atomic  radii!  The  point  here  is 
that c = 3 × 1010 cm/s  is a very  large compared with velocities we  experience 
in everyday  life.  You should be sure you can carry through this argument  for 
a 2×4  at  rest  in  the  26-100  frame  and measured  by  the  Shuttle  astronauts. 

Time  Dilation 

Suppose  now  the  Shuttle  commander  has  been  approved  to  take  a  1  hour 
nap  by  Mission  Control.  He  sets  his  alarm  clock  (situated  at  x(cid:1)  = 0)  to  go 
oﬀ  at  t(cid:1)  =  0  and  goes  to  sleep.  When  the  clock  goes  oﬀ,  Mission  Control 
approves  5  minutes  additional  rest  (the  commander  being  worn  out  from 
2×4 measurements),  so he hits the snooze button.  Then at t(cid:1) 
=300 s,  the 
snooze
alarm  goes  oﬀ  again.  The  situation  in  the  Shuttle  frame  is  shown  in  Fig.  7. 
As  before,  the  26-100  coordinates  and  the  Shuttle  coordinates  x  =  x(cid:1)  = 0 
correspond at  t = t(cid:1)  = 0.  We do we see  in 26-100?  Since  the coordinates cor-
respond at  t = t(cid:1)  = 0,  in 26-100 we  see  the ﬁrst alarm at (0, 0).  Applying  the 
� 
� 
Lorentz  Transformation  to  the  coordinates  of  the  second  alarm  in  the  Shut-
tle  rest  frame  gives  (utsnooze/  1 − u2/c2 , tsnooze/  1 − u2/c2).  Viewed  from 
� 
our  frame,  this  says  the  commander  slept  longer   by a  factor 1/  1 − u2/c2  of 
than  he  did  in  the  Shuttle  rest  frame.  In  the  26-100  frame,  the  alarm  clock 
describes  a  tra jectory  along  and  our  diagram  is  shown  in  Fig.  8. 

This  is  the  Lorentz  time  dilation.  Putting  in  the  same  numbers  as  before,

Addition   of   velocities  

Suppose  an  ob ject  moves  with  velocity  v (cid:1)  along  the  x  axis  of  the  Shuttle 
frame.  What  is  its  velocity  in  the  26-100  frame?  With  the  Galilean  trans-
formation  (which  we  know  is  not  correct),  we  would  say  the  velocity  in  the 
26-100  frame would  be  v = v (cid:1) + u. If  v = c, then  v = c + u > c  , which  con-
(cid:1) 
tradicts Einstein’s  postulate  that c  is the same  in all  inertial  frames.  How do 
we add velocities using the Lorentz transformation?  Take the total derivative 
of  each  of  the  equations:

Invariant  interval 

s = 

The Lorentz transformations  9 amount to a change of coordinates in Minkowski 
space;  the  space  of  position  and  time  ((cid:3)x, t)  (also  referred  to  as  spacetime). 
In  Euclidean  space,  we  can  rotate  the  coordinate  system  in  some  way,  yet 
the  distance  between  to  points  d  =  |(cid:3)x1  − (cid:3)x2 |  remains  the  same.  Similarly, 
the Lorentz transformations leave the interval   between two events inchanged. 
The  interval  between  two  events  is  just 
� 
c2(t1  − t2)2  − ((cid:3)x1  − (cid:3)x2 )2  . 
We  can  prove  the  invariance  of  the  interval  in  the  following  way:  start  with

−((γx1  + γβ ct1) − (γx2  + γβ ct2))2 
−(y1  − y2)2  − (z1  − z2)2 
and  expanding  and  collecting  terms  gives 
s  =  c  (t1  − t2)2  − (x1  − x2 )2  − (y1  − y2)2  − (z1  − z2 )2  = s.

So  s,  the  interval  between  two  events,  is  the  same  in  all  inertial  frames.  In 
spacetime,  s  ﬁlls  the  same  role  as  distance  does  in  Euclidian  space:  they  are 
both  invariant  quantities  under  coordinate  transformations.
