Abstract 

This   note   gives   the   derivation   of relativistic   momentum   and energy,  
as  well  as  the  transformation  of  momentum  and  energy  between  iner­
tial  frames.  The  transformations  are  then  used  to  derive  the  transfor­
mations   of forces   between   frames,   which is   necessary   for   understanding  
how   the   electric   and   magnetic   ﬁelds   are   related.  

In the last handout, we worked out how to transform events  from one inertial 
frame  to  another.  In  electricity  and  magnetism,  we  are  most  interested  in 
the  forces  (which  arise  from the ﬁelds)  and  (cid:1) = d(cid:1)
F 
p/dt, so we must  also  learn 
how momentum  and  energy  work  relativistically. 

Momentum 

If  the maximum  velocity  attainable  by  a  particle  of mass m  is  c,  then,  using 
the  (cid:1)p = m(cid:1)v  means  there  is  a maximum momentum  p = mc  and  a maximum 
kinetic  energy  T  =  mc2/2.  However,  think  of  the  following  experiment:  a 
particle  of  mass  m  and  charge  q  is  accelerated  by  some  means  to  a  velocity 
close  to  c  and  aimed  through  a  set  of  parallel  plates,  Fig  1.  Just  as  the 

particle  reaches  plate  1,  a  potential  of  strength  V  is  turned  on.  Traversing 
the  plates  gives  the  particle  an  additional  energy  ∆T  =  qV .  After  leaving, 
the  potential  is  turned  oﬀ.  Clearly,  it  is  always  possible  to  add  energy  to 
a  particle,  no  matter  what  its  velocity,  so  we  need  to  come  up  with  a  new 
deﬁnition  of  momentum.  In  coming  up  with  a  new  deﬁnition,  we  must  be 
sure  we  recover  the  (cid:1)p = m(cid:1)v  and  T  = mv 2/2 when  v << c. 

We  are  going  to  now  assume  that  inertial  mass  is  now  a  function  (as  yet 
unknown)  of  the  velocity,  m(v ).  We  will  work  out  the  function  by  doing  a 
thought  experiment.  Suppose  two  particles  of  equal  mass  collide  with  equal 
and  opposite  velocities  as  shown  in  Fig.  2a.  We  consider  the  problem  in 
frame  SA ,  Fig.  2b,  where  particle  A  moves  along  the  ˆy  axis.  Momentum  is 
conserved,  so 
√ 
m(uo )uo  =  m(  u2  + v 2)u 

(1) 

where  we  use  the  old  deﬁnition  of  momentum  with  the  modiﬁcation  that 
mass  is  a  function  of  velocity,  (cid:1)p = m(v )(cid:1)v . 

Frame  SB  moves  relative  to  frame  SA  with  velocity  v ˆx, Fig.  2c,  so  the  yˆ
component  of  the  velocity  of  particle  A  in  SB  is  gotten  from  the  velocity  of 
A  in  SA  by 
uo 
u =  γ 
where we have used the rule for ﬁnding velocities from the last writeup.  Using 
this  with  1,  we  have 
√ 
uo 
u2  + v 2) 
m(uo )uo  =  m( 
√ 
γ 
→ m(  u2  + v 2 ) =  γm(uo ). 
since  uo  is  arbitrary,  we  take  the  limit  uo  → 0, which  gives m(v ) = γm(0) = 
γmo . 

mo  is  the  rest  mass  of  the  particle  and  is  THE  mass  of  the  particle,  as,  in 
order  to  satisfy  Mr.  Einstein,  we  now  require  mass  be  a  function  of  energy. 
We  also  have  a  deﬁnition  of  momentum,  (cid:1)p =  γmo(cid:1)v .  From  now  one,  we  will 
write m  for  the  rest  mass,  dropping  the  subscript.

Now  we  want  to  know  the  energy  of  a  particle  moving  with  velocity  v . We 
work  this  out ﬁnding  the work necessary  to accelerate  a particle  from  rest  to 
velocity  v  over  some  path.  Then

From  the  last  line,  a  reasonable  interpretation  is  that  E  =  γomc2 , so when 
a  particle  is  at  rest,  γo  =  1  and  we  get  the  famous  E  = mc2 . 1  We  can  now 
also  prove  other  relations: 

E 2  =  p c  + m c

(cid:1)
Given  any  two  of  m, (cid:1) v  =  β c  and  E ,  we  can  ﬁnd  the  other  two  quantities. 
p, (cid:1)
The  relations  are  summarized  in  Fig.  3.  You  should  be  sure  you  know  how 
to  show  all  the  relations  in  the  triangle. 

Now we  have to make sure that we get  the old  expressions  for  kinetic  energy 
and  momentum  when  v <<  c.  Using  the  Taylor  expansion  for  γ  gives  γ  = 
1 + v 2/2c2 , so  we  have 

p  =  γmv ∼ mv 
E  =  γmc 2  ∼ mc  + mv  /2 
2
2
for  a  particle  moving  with  velocity  v .  Notice  that  the  total  energy  of  a 
particle  E  is  the  sum  of  the  kinetic  energy  and mc2 ,  which  is  called  the  rest 
energy. 

Transformation  of  energy  and  momentum  be-
tween  inertial  frames 

Suppose particle of mass m has momentum  (cid:1)p nd energy E  in  frame S . What 
? If we know  (cid:1)β (cid:1)  = (cid:1)v (cid:1)/c, then we can easily 
are the energy and momentum in S (cid:1)
ﬁnd (cid:1)(cid:1)  and E (cid:1)
β (cid:1)
, so we just need to work out  (cid:1)
p
, we will know everything.  From 
the  last  handout,  we  use  the  addition  of  velocities.  To  save  writing,  we  will 
use  β  =  u/v , where  u  is  the  relative  velocities  of  S  and  S (cid:1) ,  βx  =  vx/c  and 
β
y  = vy /c,  for  the  components  of (cid:1)v .  Then,

Transformation  of  forces 

The  electric  and magnetic  ﬁelds  create  forces  and  transforming  the  forces  is 
key  to  transforming  the  ﬁelds.  As  usual,  we  start  with  a  force  (cid:1)F  in  S  which 
moves  relative  to  S (cid:1)  with  velocity  (cid:1)u  =  β c  =  u ˆ

Some  examples 

When physicists talk about relativistic kinematics,  they usually express ener-
gies  in  electron  volts  or  eV .  This  is  just  the  energy  a particle  of one  electron 
of  charge  has  when  it  sits  at  a  potential  of  1  Volt;  1  eV=4.8 × 10
−10esu × 
1Volt/300Volts/statvolt  =  1.6 × 10
−12ergs.  Since  E  =  mc2 ,  we  can  express 
masses  using  units  of  eV /c2  = 1.8 × 10
−33g.  Thus,  the  electron,  which  has  a 
mass of 9.1×10
−28  g would have a mass of me  = 511, 000 eV/c2  or 511 keV/c . 
2 
Similarly, momenta  my  be  expressed  using  units  of  eV/c. 

Pion  decay 

The  lowest mass nuclear particle  is the charged pion or π . The π  is unstable, 
with a lifetime of 26 ns and decays to a muon (µ) and a neutrino (ν ), π → µν . 
The  pion  has  a  mass  of  mπ  =  140 MeV/c2 ,  the  muon  has  a  mass  mµ  = 
106 MeV/c2  and  the  neutrino  is massless. 

We start by asking:  if a π  decays at rest, what are the energies and momenta 
of the decay products,  the µ and the ν ?  To ﬁnd  the answer,  use the fact that 
energy and momentum are conserved  in the decay.  Notice that since mν  = 0, 
pν  = −(cid:1)
pµ , so  we  take  |(cid:1)
pµ | =  |(cid:1)
pν | = p. Energy 
Eν  = pν c.  Referring  to  Fig.  4,  (cid:1)

momentum  and  E  =  p2c2  + m2 c4  = 110MeV  for  the muon  energy.

. 

Next,  we  want  to  think  about  the  decay  of  a  pion  moving  with  velocity  v . 
When  it  decays,  the  momentum  and  energy  of  the  muon  and  neutrino  will 
depend  on  the  decay  angle  in  the  rest  frame  of  the  pion,  Fig.  4b.  We  can 
use  relativity  to  ﬁnd  out  the  energy  and  angle  in  the  lab  frame  in  which  the 
pion  moves  with  (cid:1)v  =  v ˆx.  In  the  pion  rest  frame,  after  the  decay,  the  muon 
has momentum 

px  =  p cos θ 
py  =  p sin θ 

where  p = 30MeV/c.  Using  Eq.  3-6  to  transform  into  a  the  lab  frame  gives 
(cid:1) 
p  =  γ p cos θ + β γE 
x 
(cid:1) 
py  =  p sin θ 
E (cid:1)  =  γE + β γ p cos θ. 
The range of possible energies  is γE − β γ p to γE + β γ p.  For example,  a pion 
� 
with kinetic  energy  of 500 MeV would  have  a  total energy  of Eπ  = 640 MeV. 
Then,  γ  =  Eπ /mπ  = 4.6 and  β  = 1 − 1/γ 2  = 0.98.  Then,  the  minimum 
muon  energy  is  371 MeV  and maximum  is  641 MeV.

Cutoﬀ  in  cosmic  rays 

There  is  a  very  interesting  eﬀect  in  cosmic  rays.  Very  high  energy  protons 
travel  vast  distances  without  losing  much  energy.  However,  above  a  certain 
energy,  a  new  loss  mechanism  becomes  important.  A  proton  can  absorb 
a  photon  and  make  a  ∆  particle,  the  next  lightest  nuclear  particle.  The 
reaction  is  p + γ  →  ∆.  The  ∆  is  unstable  and  quickly  decays  to  a  proton 
and  a  pion:  ∆ → p + π . 

The  universe  is ﬁlled with photons  emitted when  electrons  bound  to protons 
300,000  years  after  the  Big  Bang.  At  the  time,  the  photons  had  energies 
of  around  10eV.  Since  then,  the  expansion  of  the  universe  has  caused  them 
to  cool  to  about  200  µeV.  These  relic  photons  are  hit  by  very  high  energy 
protons to make ∆s.  If the mass of the ∆ is m∆  = 1150 MeV/c2 , what energy 
proton  is  necessary  to  produce  a ∆? 

In  order  to make  a ∆,  the  total  energy  of  the  proton  and  photon must  be  at 
least the m∆ c2 :  Ep + Eγ  = m∆ c .  In addition,  total momentum  is conserved: 
2 
γ /c + pp  =  p∆ .  Remember,  for  a  massless  particle  like  a  photon,  E  =  pc.

Inthe  universe  (unprimed)  frame,  the ∆  has  and  energy  E∆  and momentum

Once  produced,  the ∆ moves  with  essentially  the  proton  energy  and,  after  a 
very  short  time,  decays  to  a  proton  and  a  pion, ∆ → p + π .  The  interesting 
question  is  than:  what  is  the maximum  energy  the  ﬁnal  proton  can  have?

In  the ∆ rest  (primed)  frame, we have energy  conservation:  m∆ c2

Thus,  the production and decay of the ∆ by very high energy protons results 
in  a  limit  to  the  proton  energy  of  6 × 1020 eV.  Protons  with  higher  energies 
get  knocked  back  down  by  the  ∆  production  and  decay.  Interestingly,  some 
experiments claim to have observed cosmic rays above this limit, which either 
the  originate  nearby  (from  as  yet  unknown  sources)  or  they  are  not  protons 
or  nucleons.  Several  new  experiments  are  attempting  to  search  for  these 
unusual  cosmics  rays  with  higher  sensitivity.
