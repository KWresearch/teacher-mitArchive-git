REVIEW OF CLASSICAL MECHANICS 

(1) Kinematics
(a) Position vector, Description of the motion
We  describe the position of a particle by specifying its coordinates with respect to a frame S.  S is really 
a  point,  which  serves  as  the  origin,  i.e.  the  point  with  coordinates  ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) .  Thus,  for  a  Cartesian 
coordinate  system,  a  particle  at  a  point  P  is  described  by  three  numbers,  ( x , y , z ) ,  the distances of  P 
� 
from the origin along the three axes.  The vector from the origin to P is called the position vector, r  , of 
� 
the particle.  The position vector  contains  all  the  information  regarding  this particle.  If we know  r  as a 
function  of  time,  then we  know  everything we  always wanted  to know  about  this particle's  future.   Let 
� 
� 
� 
� 
r  =  r (t )  = x (t ) xˆ + y (t ) yˆ + z (t ) zˆ .  Then  the velocity,  v ( t ) , and the acceleration,  a (t ) , of the particle at 
time  t are given by

To  summarize: we can get  the position vector of a particle  (if we know  its velocity or acceleration as a 
function  of  time)  by  a  simple  integration,  if we  know  the  initial  conditions,  i.e.  the  velocity  and  position 
vector at some point in time (say  t=0).

(b) Motion in a straight line 
The above equations for the position vector can be applied to the case where the particle is moving in a 
straight line.  There are a few useful special cases: 
(a) particle moving with constant velocity in the vacuum (i.e. no friction) 
+ v  t where  r �  is  the  initial  position  of  the  particle.  In  one–dimensional motion,  say  along  the 
� 
� 
� 
r ( t ) =  r o 
o
x-axis, this equation becomes  x (t )  = x o 
+ v t  , i.e. our familiar equation from elementary kinematics. 
(b) particle moving with constant acceleration

, where  r o  and  v �  are  the  initial position and  velocity of  the
� 
v ( t )  = v o 
+ a t  and  r (t ) = r o 
+ v  t +  a t
o

particle, respectively.  Again, for motion only along the x-axis, we get: 
1 
+ v t +  at 2 
v ( t ) = v o 
+ at  and  x (t ) = x o 
o 
2 
Deceleration  is  a negative  acceleration.   Example:  a  car  is moving with  constant  speed  u.  At  time  t=0 
the  driver  uses  the  brakes  to  decelerate  uniformly.  The  car  comes  to  a  halt  after  a  distance  s.  What 
was the deceleration of the car? 
The velocity of the car, and the distance it  has traveled at time t are given by 
1 
v  = u  - at
x =  ut  - at 2 
 and 
2 
We  are  given  the  total  distance  it  travels  until  it  stops,  i.e.  until  v  = 0 .  From  the velocity equation,  this 
Substituting  this  value  of  time  in  the  distance  equation,  we  obtain 
will  take  t=u/a  sec.

Another  example:  a  gun  fires  a  particle  at  an  angle  q with  respect  to  the horizontal, with  initial velocity 
V .  How far from the gun does the bullet land?
o 
Decompose  the motion  along  two  independent  axes,  the horizontal  ( x )  and vertical  ( y ) .  We take the 
origin to be at the gun. 
Along  the  x -axis: motion with constant velocity  V  = V  cos q �  x  = V t .  Thus, we need to find how
x
o 
x 
long  it  will  take  the  bullet  to  strike  the  ground.    This  is  given  by  twice  the  time  it  takes  it  to  reach  its 
maximum height,  H.  Now  along  the y-axis, we have a particle that is moving with constant acceleration 
–g, and with  initial velocity  V  =  V  sin  q .  We have already computed the time it will take the bullet to

o 
reach  this  maximum  height  (i.e.  the  time  it  will  take  to  stop  moving  in  the  vertical  direction)  in  the

example  above with  the  decelerating  car:  t  = 
.  Thus,  the  total  travel  time  is  twice  that  (it  takes  the 
g 
bullet this much longer to come back down to the ground) and thus the horizontal distance from the gun 
will be

(c) Motion in a circle
Since  velocity  is  a  vector,  one  can  have  a  change  in  velocity  without  a  change  in  speed  (i.e.  the 
magnitude  of  the  velocity  vector).  A  particle  moving  with  constant  speed  in  a  circle  of  radius  R 
accelerates continually! 
With  our  origin  at  the  center  of  the  circle,  the  position 
� 
� 
vector  at  time  t   and  t + dt   is  given  by  r � and  r  + d r 
respectively. The velocity vector is  v � and  v +  d v .  To find 
� 
� 
the  acceleration,  we  need  to  compute  the  vector  d v � .

From the figure,  d v  » -v d  frˆ .  Therefore,

Example: a particle of mass m moving on a frictionless table with constant speed v.  It is connected to a 
string supporting a mass M.  What is the radius, R, of the circle? 

The  particle  is  moving  in  a  circle,  thus  it  is 
accelerating, and thus there must be a net force acting 
on it:  the tension from the string, T.

(2) Forces
(a) Newton and Gravity
According to Newton, force is the "thing" that causes the momentum of an object to change: 
�

d  �

F  = 
( p ) � p  = Constant when  F  = 0 .   From  this,  and  for  the  special  case  of  a  constant mass, we

get the familiar Force = mass·acceleration formula:

p  =  m v  = m
F  =

While we are on the subject of Newton, let us remember his third law also, i.e. that  Action = Reaction: 
� 
� 
� 
F  = - F  ,  i.e.  the  force  on  particle  2  from  particle  1,  F 2 1   ,  is  equal  and  opposite  to  the  force  on

already used this in the section on kinematics in the ballistics problem.

If  the  total  external  force  on  a  system  of  particles  is  zero,  then  the  total  momentum  of  the  system  is 
constant.  Applications:  two  colliding masses  m  and  m b  with  initial velocities  v  and  v b  respectively,

(3) Work and Energy
(a) Introduction
�  � 
Suppose we  know  the  total  force,  F( r , t ) , acting on a particle of mass m, as a function of the particle's 
position and  time.  Classical mechanics addresses  the problem of predicting  the motion of  this particle: 
given  this  force  and  some  initial  conditions  (e.g.  the  position  and  velocity  of  the  particle  at  some  time 
previous time) what is the velocity and position of this particle? 
Let's look at this problem in the one–dimensional case first, and let's assume that the force does not vary 
with time, i.e. F=F(x).  To solve for the motion, we integrate with respect to x   : 
F( x ) = m  � � x b  F ( x ) dx  = m 
� x b dv 
dx  =  m � t b dv

Thus,  if  we  know  the  velocity,  v o  ,  at  some  position  x  ,  the  velocity,  v ,  at  position x  is  given  by
o

In  general,  the  line  integral of a vector  function  A  along a path of integration, C is written as

(c) The idea of a field; Potential
The gravitational field due to a sphere of mass M and radius R, for distances r>R, is given by

rˆ  and the force on a mass  m  is  F = mEG
= -
EG 
2 r 
Note  that  in  the  above  equation  the  field  due  to  the mass  M  is  independent of  any other  field  sources! 
Thus, for any collection of point masses, we can claim that we know the total field due to gravity — by 
simply  applying  the  superposition  principle.  As  an example, given two masses a and b, what is the field 
at point m? 

ﬁ
r 2 

The field at the point m is the sum of the fields due 
to each mass separately: 
� 
� 
� 
EG (Total ) = EG  (M1 ) + EG  (M 2) 
GM1  �  GM2  � 
3  r1  -
= -
3  r2 
r 2 
r1 
� 
� 
The force on m  is thus  F = mE 
M2 
G (Total ) . 
The moral of the story is: given the field at any point, we can compute the force on any small "charge" of 
mass m   at  that point.  Given  that we know how  to get  from  the  force  to  the velocity of  the  test  charge 
(i.e.  through  the work–energy theorem) and then from the velocity to the position of the test charge as a 
function of time, we conclude that all we need to do to solve for the motion of a small test charge m is to 
find  the gravitational field at all points  in space.  (Note:  this is true only for the case where the mass m is 
itself very small or the field sources are fixed magically). 

Having  defined  the  field  in  this  way,  we  can  now  define  the  Potential  of  the  field,  f  ,  so  that  the 
potential energy,  U , of a particle of mass m in the field is given by U=mf.  Just like the field is the force 
per unit charge, the potential is the potential energy per unit charge.  (Charge in this case refers to mass, 
i.e.  the  "charge"  of  the  gravitational  field).    So  what  is  left  now?  To  establish  a  relationship  for 
calculating

thus 
the  force  also)  given

(4) Angular momentum, Torque
The  idea  is  simple:  there  are  cases  in  which  the  total  force  on  an  object  is  zero,  yet  the  object  is 
accelerating. 

F 

An  example  is  given  in  the  figure, where  two  forces are applied  to 
a  cylinder,  attached  to  a  frictionless  axis  through  it  center.  It  is 
clear that the cylinder will rotate with respect to its axis. 
We  define  the  angular  momentum  of  particle  with  respect  to  an 
� 
axis  to  be  L  = r � · p  ,  where  r � is  the  vector  from  the  axis  to  the

There  is one more quantity  that we need  to complete  the discussion of  rotations of  rigid bodies,  that of 
the  moment  of  inertia.  Suppose  a  body  is  rotating with angular velocity  w with  respect  to  some  fixed 
axis  O.  Then,  the  total  kinetic  energy  of  the  body  is  given  by  the  sum  of  the  kinetic  energies  of  the 
infinitesimal particles into which we can divide it: 
m r w = ( lim  � 1

The  quantity  in  parentheses  clearly  depends  only  on  the  geometrical  distribution  of  the  mass  on  the 
body.  The sum can be turned into an integral: 
r  dm  = � r  rdV  , where r is the density of the body and dV the element of volume.

(A) Multivariable Calculus
(1) Scalar Functions
For a function  f(x) of one variable x, the derivative is defined as 
f ( x + Dx ) - f ( x )
df 
=  lim
Dx 
dx 
D x ﬁ 0 
we know that the derivative at a point is the slope, i.e. the rate of change of the function with respect to 
x .  In other words, we can predict the change in the value of the function  f(x) in the immediate vicinity of 
a point xo  , provided we have the derivative of f  at that point:

What  if  the function  f   is  a  function  of  two  variables,  x  and  y, i.e. f=f(x,y) ?  Given a point  ( x o , y o ) , we 
would like to know the change in the function when we change simultaneously  x  by dx  and y by dy. 
To  compute  this  change, we  first  keep  the  variable  y fixed at the point  yo  and let the variable x change 
by dx ;  the change in  f  , df , is given by 
f  ( x + Dx , y o ) - f ( x o , y o  ) ø
Ø 
df  =

ºD x ﬁ0

Similarly, if we keep x fixed at x
and we change y by dy, the change in  f  is given by
o 
+ Dy , x o ) - f ( xo  , yo  ) ø 
Ø 
f  ( yo 
df  =

limŒD x ﬁ0

º 
we thus define a partial derivative for the function  f(x,y) with respect to one of the variables x or y as the 
derivative of  f  with  respect  to  x  or  y,  keeping  the  other  variable  (y or x )  fixed.  We denote this partial

derivative by

¶ f

¶x 
¶y 
Equipped  with  all  this,  we  can  now  ask  what  happens  when  both  x   and  y  change  by  dx   and  dy 
respectively: 
D f  =  f ( x  + D x , y + D y ) - f  ( x , y )  =  f  ( x  + D x, y + D y )  - f ( x , y  + D y ) +  f  ( x , y  + D y)  - f ( x , y ) 
=  D f ( y  constant at  y  +  D y ) +  D f  ( x  constant at  x )

(2) Vector Functions
� 
Let's  look  at  a  vector  function,  A( p ) , which  depends  on  only  one  variable,  p.  What  is  the change in 
this  function  as  p  changes  by  dp  ?  We  realize  that  this  vector  function  is  nothing  more  than  three 
independent functions  A x ( p ) , A y ( p ),  A  ( p ) .  Then,
z 
� 
� 
� 
d A  = A ( p + dp  ) - A( p ) 
= ( A  ( p + dp ) - A x ( p ) )xˆ  + (A  ( p + dp ) - A y ( p ) )yˆ  + ( A  ( p + dp ) - A  ( p ) )zˆ 
x 
y
z
z 
= dA  xˆ  + dA y yˆ  + dA z  zˆ 
x 
Now  since  A  ( p ) , A y ( p ),  A  ( p )   are  scalar  functions  of  only  one  variable,  we  already  know  how  to
x
z 
evaluate their differentials, namely  dA  = �� dA i 
� 
i ˛ {x, y , z}

The final answer is thus

Example:  the  position  vector  of  a  particle  is  given  by  r  = 3t 2 xˆ  + 6 tyˆ  + (3  - 4 t ) zˆ .  We  have  been 
through  this  before:  the  change  in  the  position  vector  due  to  an  infinitesimal  change  in  time  is  simply 
� 
d r  = (6 txˆ  + 6 yˆ  - 4 zˆ )dt  . 

xˆ  +

Finally,  we  investigate  vector  functions  of  several  variables.  For  illustration  purposes,  we  consider  a 
three-dimensional vector function of two variables, say  p and q  : 
� 
� 
A( p , q )  = A x  ( p , q ) xˆ  + A y ( p, q ) yˆ  + Az ( p , q ) zˆ �  d A  = dA  ( p , q )xˆ  + dA y ( p, q ) yˆ  + dA  ( p , q ) zˆ

z 
and the differential of the ith component  ( i  = x , y , z )  is given by 
¶Ai

dA i ( p, q )  =

We  now  know  how  to  compute  the  variation of any function, scalar or vector, i.e. 1–D or N–D (where 
2–D  for  example,  means  2-dimensional),  with  respect  to  variations  in  the  parameters  the  function 
depends on. 

A very interesting  — and physically meaningful  — case is when one has a vector function that depends 
on  position.  An  example  is  the  gravitational  field.  A  mass M  creates  a  field  around  it.  Any  mass  m 
brough  close  to  M  will  thus  experience  a  force.  We  define  the  field  so  that  it  is  dependent  only  on 
� 
GM
= -
rˆ .  Given the field, the
parameters  associated with  the  source.    In  other words, we  define  EG

force on  any mass  m   is given by  FG

as

so  this  is  a  vector  field  which  depends  on  three  variables,  x ,   y  and  z.  The  change  in  this  field  in  the 
neighborhood of  ( x , y , z )  i.e. when x ﬁ  x + dx ,  y  ﬁ  y  + dy ,  z ﬁ  z  + dz  is then

(3) The gradient operator
d
An  operator  is  a  "thing"  that  acts  on  an  object.  In  this  sense,  the  derivative  operator  is  equal  to  dx  . 
Given  any  function  f(x),  this  operator  acts  on  the  function  to  deliver  a  new  function,  the  derivative  of 
d 
df
f(x).  Thus, dx  f(x) = dx  . 
By the same token, we can think of the differential of a function of three variables as the dot product of 
two  vectors:  the vector  �� ¶ f 
¶ f  � 
� 
¶ f 
and the vector  ( dx , dy , dz ) .  Let us call the first vector  C  — the 
, 
, 
Ł ¶x  ¶y  ¶ z ł 
� 
�  .  Then,  df  = C  � d r 
�  .  In other words,  for  any  function  f  ( x, y , z )  we

We define an operator to be equal to the parenthesis that acts on  f :

we  call  this  operator  the  gradient  operator.  When  it  acts  on  a  function,  it  gives  as  a  vector  whose 
direction is the direction of maximum change of the function.  Its magnitude is equal to the rate of change 
of the function, in this direction of maximum change, with respect to changes in  x,y and z. 

15


This  is  but  a  generalization  of  everything we have done so far: The change in a function of one variable, 
df
df 
xˆ  � dx xˆ .  For  a  function  of  three  variables,
dx  = 
f  ( x ) ,  due  to  change  in  x ﬁ  x  +  dx   is  df  =

f  ( x, y , z ) , the equivalent change is  df  =  C  � d r  , where  C  ”  xˆ

¶ f

What  is  the meaning  of  the  gradient of a function? Remember, the gradient is a vector.  The direction of 
the  vector  is  the  direction  in  which  the  change  in  the  function  is  maximum.  And  the  magnitude  of  the 
vector is equal to the rate of change of the function in this maximal direction. 

Example: a fly is in a room whose temperature is given by  T ( x, y , z )  = 

z
x  +  y

we go up towards the ceiling, and warmer as we approach, say, the point (0,0) which is taken to be the 
middle  of  the  room. 
In  which  direction  should  the  fly  move  in  order  to  maximize  the  change  in 
temperature  it  will  experience?  This  direction  is  given  by  the  gradient  of  the  temperature:
