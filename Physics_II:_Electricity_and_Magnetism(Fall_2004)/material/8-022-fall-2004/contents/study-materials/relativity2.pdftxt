Abstract

This note gives the derivation of relativistic momentum and energy,
as well as the transformation of momentum and energy between iner-
tial frames. The transformations are then used to derive the transfor-
mations of forces between frames, which is necessary for understanding
how the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are related.

In the last handout, we worked out how to transform events from one inertial
frame to another. In electricity and magnetism, we are most interested in
the forces (which arise from the ﬁelds) and (cid:1)F = d(cid:1)p/dt, so we must also learn
how momentum and energy work relativistically.

Momentum

If the maximum velocity attainable by a particle of mass m is c, then, using
the (cid:1)p = m(cid:1)v means there is a maximum momentum p = mc and a maximum
kinetic energy T = mc2/2. However, think of the following experiment: a
particle of mass m and charge q is accelerated by some means to a velocity
close to c and aimed through a set of parallel plates, Fig 1. Just as the

particle reaches plate 1, a potential of strength V is turned on. Traversing
the plates gives the particle an additional energy ∆T = qV . After leaving,
the potential is turned oﬀ. Clearly, it is always possible to add energy to
a particle, no matter what its velocity, so we need to come up with a new
deﬁnition of momentum. In coming up with a new deﬁnition, we must be
sure we recover the (cid:1)p = m(cid:1)v and T = mv 2/2 when v << c.

We are going to now assume that inertial mass is now a function (as yet
unknown) of the velocity, m(v ). We will work out the function by doing a
thought experiment. Suppose two particles of equal mass collide with equal
and opposite velocities as shown in Fig. 2a. We consider the problem in
frame SA , Fig. 2b, where particle A moves along the ˆy axis. Momentum is
conserved, so
√

m(uo )uo = m(

u2 + v 2)u

(1)

where we use the old deﬁnition of momentum with the modiﬁcation that
mass is a function of velocity, (cid:1)p = m(v )(cid:1)v .

Frame SB moves relative to frame SA with velocity v ˆx, Fig. 2c, so the ˆy
component of the velocity of particle A in SB is gotten from the velocity of
A in SA by

u =

uo
γ

where we have used the rule for ﬁnding velocities from the last writeup. Using
this with 1, we have
√

m(uo )uo = m(
√

u2 + v 2)

uo
γ

→ m(
u2 + v 2 ) = γm(uo ).
since uo is arbitrary, we take the limit uo → 0, which gives m(v ) = γm(0) =
γmo .

mo is the rest mass of the particle and is THE mass of the particle, as, in
order to satisfy Mr. Einstein, we now require mass be a function of energy.
We also have a deﬁnition of momentum, (cid:1)p = γmo(cid:1)v . From now one, we will
write m for the rest mass, dropping the subscript.

Energy

Now we want to know the energy of a particle moving with velocity v . We
work this out ﬁnding the work necessary to accelerate a particle from rest to
velocity v over some path. Then

From the last line, a reasonable interpretation is that E = γomc2 , so when
a particle is at rest, γo = 1 and we get the famous E = mc2 .1 We can now
also prove other relations:

E 2 = p2 c2 + m2 c4

Given any two of m, (cid:1)p, (cid:1)v = (cid:1)β c and E , we can ﬁnd the other two quantities.
The relations are summarized in Fig. 3. You should be sure you know how
to show all the relations in the triangle.

Now we have to make sure that we get the old expressions for kinetic energy
and momentum when v << c. Using the Taylor expansion for γ gives γ =
1 + v 2/2c2 , so we have

p = γmv ∼ mv
E = γmc2 ∼ mc2 + mv 2/2
for a particle moving with velocity v . Notice that the total energy of a
particle E is the sum of the kinetic energy and mc2 , which is called the rest
energy.

Transformation of energy and momentum be-
tween inertial frames

Suppose particle of mass m has momentum (cid:1)p nd energy E in frame S . What
? If we know (cid:1)β (cid:1)
are the energy and momentum in S (cid:1)
= (cid:1)v (cid:1)/c, then we can easily
ﬁnd (cid:1)p(cid:1)
and E (cid:1)
, so we just need to work out (cid:1)β (cid:1)
, we will know everything. From
the last handout, we use the addition of velocities. To save writing, we will
use β = u/v , where u is the relative velocities of S and S (cid:1)
, βx = vx/c and
βy = vy /c, for the components of (cid:1)v . Then,

Transformation of forces

The electric and magnetic ﬁelds create forces and transforming the forces is
key to transforming the ﬁelds. As usual, we start with a force (cid:1)F in S which
with velocity (cid:1)u = (cid:1)β c = u ˆx and ﬁnd (cid:1)F (cid:1)

Some examples

When physicists talk about relativistic kinematics, they usually express ener-
gies in electron volts or eV . This is just the energy a particle of one electron
of charge has when it sits at a potential of 1 Volt; 1 eV=4.8 × 10
−10esu ×
1Volt/300Volts/statvolt = 1.6 × 10
−12ergs. Since E = mc2 , we can express
masses using units of eV /c2 = 1.8 × 10
−33g. Thus, the electron, which has a
mass of 9.1×10
−28 g would have a mass of me = 511, 000 eV/c2 or 511 keV/c2 .
Similarly, momenta my be expressed using units of eV/c.

Pion decay

The lowest mass nuclear particle is the charged pion or π . The π is unstable,
with a lifetime of 26 ns and decays to a muon (µ) and a neutrino (ν ), π → µν .
The pion has a mass of mπ = 140 MeV/c2 , the muon has a mass mµ =
106 MeV/c2 and the neutrino is massless.

We start by asking: if a π decays at rest, what are the energies and momenta
of the decay products, the µ and the ν ? To ﬁnd the answer, use the fact that
energy and momentum are conserved in the decay. Notice that since mν = 0,
Eν = pν c. Referring to Fig. 4, (cid:1)pν = −(cid:1)pµ , so we take |(cid:1)pµ | = |(cid:1)pν | = p. Energy

.

Next, we want to think about the decay of a pion moving with velocity v .
When it decays, the momentum and energy of the muon and neutrino will
depend on the decay angle in the rest frame of the pion, Fig. 4b. We can
use relativity to ﬁnd out the energy and angle in the lab frame in which the
pion moves with (cid:1)v = v ˆx. In the pion rest frame, after the decay, the muon
has momentum

px = p cos θ
py = p sin θ

where p = 30MeV/c. Using Eq. 3-6 to transform into a the lab frame gives
p(cid:1)
x = γ p cos θ + β γE
p(cid:1)
y = p sin θ
E (cid:1)
= γE + β γ p cos θ.
The range of possible energies is γE − β γ p to γE + β γ p. For example, a pion
(cid:4)
with kinetic energy of 500 MeV would have a total energy of Eπ = 640 MeV.
1 − 1/γ 2 = 0.98. Then, the minimum
Then, γ = Eπ /mπ = 4.6 and β =
muon energy is 371 MeV and maximum is 641 MeV.

Cutoﬀ in cosmic rays

There is a very interesting eﬀect in cosmic rays. Very high energy protons
travel vast distances without losing much energy. However, above a certain
energy, a new loss mechanism becomes important. A proton can absorb
a photon and make a ∆ particle, the next lightest nuclear particle. The
reaction is p + γ → ∆. The ∆ is unstable and quickly decays to a proton
and a pion: ∆ → p + π .

The universe is ﬁlled with photons emitted when electrons bound to protons
300,000 years after the Big Bang. At the time, the photons had energies
of around 10eV. Since then, the expansion of the universe has caused them
to cool to about 200 µeV. These relic photons are hit by very high energy
protons to make ∆s. If the mass of the ∆ is m∆ = 1150 MeV/c2 , what energy
proton is necessary to produce a ∆?

In order to make a ∆, the total energy of the proton and photon must be at
least the m∆ c2 : Ep + Eγ = m∆ c2 . In addition, total momentum is conserved:
Eγ /c + pp = p∆ . Remember, for a massless particle like a photon, E = pc.
Inthe universe (unprimed) frame, the ∆ has and energy E∆ and momentum
p∆ . Then

Once produced, the ∆ moves with essentially the proton energy and, after a
very short time, decays to a proton and a pion, ∆ → p + π . The interesting
question is than: what is the maximum energy the ﬁnal proton can have?
p + E (cid:1)
In the ∆ rest (primed) frame, we have energy conservation: m∆ c2 = E (cid:1)
p = −(cid:1)p(cid:1)

and momentum conservation: (cid:1)p(cid:1)

which gives a proton momentum of p(cid:1)
p = 144 MeV/c. If the ∆ has an energy
of 6 × 1020 eV, then γ = 5.2 × 1011 (and of course β = 1 to a very good
approximation). Then, the maximum energy the proton can have in the lab
frame is
p = γEp + β γ ppc = 5.6 × 1020 eV.
E (cid:1)

Thus, the production and decay of the ∆ by very high energy protons results
in a limit to the proton energy of 6 × 1020 eV. Protons with higher energies
get knocked back down by the ∆ production and decay. Interestingly, some
experiments claim to have observed cosmic rays above this limit, which either
the originate nearby (from as yet unknown sources) or they are not protons
or nucleons. Several new experiments are attempting to search for these
unusual cosmics rays with higher sensitivity.
