An  electric  charge  +Q  sits  at  one  of  the  corners  of  a  cube  of  side  a  as  shown  in  the  ﬁgure

above,  i.e,  through  the  face   of  the  cube  that  is  described  by  y  =  a? 

Seven  additional  charges  are  added  at   the  corners  of  the  cube  as  shown  in  the   next   ﬁgure  so 
that  the  system  now  has  a  total  of  four  positive  electric   charges  of  strength  +Q   each  and 
four   negative  ones  of  strength  -Q  each  distributed  on  the  cube   with  alternating  signs.   All  
eight  charges  are  ﬁxed  at  these   positions.

An  additional  electric  charge  q  is  inserted  at  the  center  of  the   cube  (the   eight  charges  on 
the  corners  of  the  cube  remain  ﬁxed  at   their  positions).

(25   points)  [3]  Image(s)  of  a   Charged  Wire  

An  inﬁnitely  long  wire  carries  static   electric  charge  of  line  density  λ. 

•	 (a) Find  the  electric  ﬁeld  �E  at   a  distance  r  from  the   wire.

We  now  bring  this  wire  in  the   vicinity  of  an  L-shaped  inﬁnite  conducting  surface  that  is 
grounded  (i.e.,  φ  =  0)  as  shown  in  the  ﬁgure.  The   wire  runs  parallel  to  the  z  axis  and  all  
its  points  are  equidistant  to  the  planes.  Let   us  name  this  distance  a.

(25   points)  [4]  Triple  Layer   Capacitor  System 

A  capacitor   is  made  of  three  conducting  concentric  spherical  shells  of  radii  a, 2a and   3a 
as  shown  in  the  ﬁgure  below.  
In  what  follows  we  will  assume  that   the   shells  are  thick 
enough  that   we  may  distinguish  the  inner  and  outer  surfaces,  but  thin  enough  that   we  do 
not  actually  need  to  know  what  their  thickness  is. 

3a 

2a 

a 

The  inner   and  outer  shells  are  grounded:  their  potentials  are  ﬁxed  to  be   zero  (φ =  0).  The 
middle  shell  carries  some  net   charge  Q.  This  charge  induces  a   charge  Qin  on  the  outer  edge 
of  the  inner  shell  and  a  charge  Qout  on  the   inner  edge   of  the  outer  shell.   Note  that  these 
charges  are  taken  from  ground,  so  the  inner   and  outer  shells  are  not  electrically  neutral. 

•	 (a) What  is  the  electric  ﬁeld  in  the  region  r < a? 

•	 (b)  What  is  the  electric   ﬁeld  in  the  region  a < r < 2a?  Your  answer  should  be 
expressed  in  terms  of  Qin . 

•	 (c)  What  is  the  electric   ﬁeld  in  the  region  2a < r < 3a?  Your  answer  should  be 
expressed  in  terms  of  Qin  and  Q. 

•	 (d)  What  is  the  electric  ﬁeld  in  the  region  r > 3a?  Using this  result,  ﬁnd  Qout  in  terms 
of  Qin  and  Q. 

•	 (e)  Find  the  potential  of  the   middle  shell  with  respect   to  the  ground  ﬁrst   by  going 
from  the  inner  shell  to  the   middle  shell  and  then  by  going  from  the  outer  shell  to  the 
middle  shell.  Leave  your  answers  in  terms  of  Qin  and  Q. 

•	 (f ) Using the  answer  to  part  (e),  ﬁnd  Qin  in  terms  of  Q. 

•	 (g) What  is  the  capacitance   of this  system? 

•	 (h)  What  is  the  potential  energy  of  this  system?
