S3 

R1=R 

-

V 

S2 

R2=2R 

C 

R3=3R 

Initially all switches are open and the capacitor C is discharged.  

a)  At time t=t0, we close S1 and S2 simultaneously.  

b)  At time t=t1 >> t0 we close S3 (with S1 and S2 still closed). 

c)  At time t=t2 >> t1 we open S1 (S2 and S3 still closed). 


Sketch how the following quantities vary over time:  
a) VC (potential across capacitor) 
b) IR2 (current flowing through R2) 
c) VR3 (potential across R3) 

NB: please specify asymptotic values and time constants. You do not need to solve 
differential equations or to write down the explicitly each function.

A wire bent into a semicircle with a radius r rotates with a constant angular velocity ω . 
The wire is connected to a resistor R through a conductor of dimensions a and b in the y 
and x direction respectively to form a closed loop. The loop is placed into a uniform 
magnetic field B //  ˆz (into the page). 

a) Find the total flux through the loop as function of time. 

b) Find the e.m.f. created in the loop. Indicate the direction of the current over time.

( )  = Be−λ  . Find the current I through the resistor as a function of time.
