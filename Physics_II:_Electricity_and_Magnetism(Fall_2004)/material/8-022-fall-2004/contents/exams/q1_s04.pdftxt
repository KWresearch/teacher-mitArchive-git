PROBLEM  1  (8  pts)

Answer  the  following  questions,  justifying  your  answers  with  one  short  sentence.

(a) A  house  has  two  lightning  rods  on  its  roof,  one with  a  sphere  on  the  end,  the  other with 
a  pointy  tip. 

Which  gets  struck  by  lightning more  often? 
(b)  A  charged  rod  is  brought  close  to  a  balloon  that  is  coated  with  a  conducting  foil.  The 
balloon  is  neutral.  Is  the  balloon  attracted,  repelled,  or  does  it  feel  no  force? 
(c)  A  soap  bubble  initially  has  a  net  positive  charge  smeared  uniformly  over  its  surface. 
Negative  charge  is  slowly  and  uniformly  added  to  the  bubble’s  surface,  reducing  the  charge 
until  it passes  through zero, and winds up with a net negative charge.  Describe  the bubble’s 
behavior  as  the  charge  is  added. 
(d) The  door  of  a microwave  over  contains  a  screen, which  is made  of  a  conducting material 
with  lots  of  small  holes.  The  size  of  these  holes  is  roughly  1  mm.  Given  that  you  can  look 
through this screen at your food without cooking your eyeballs, what can you conclude about 
the  wavelength  of  radiation  used  in  the  oven?

(a)  Find  an  expression  for  the  charge  density  λ(r),  valid  everywhere. 
(b) Sketch this charge density versus radius.  From this sketch, describe why the electric ﬁeld 
falls  to  zero  so  quickly  as  a  function  of  radius. 
(c)  Find  the  radius  r  at  which  the  charge  density  is  zero  (other  than  r = �). 
(d)  Find  an  expression  for  the  electric  potential  π  everywhere. 
(e)  Find  the  total  energy  stored  in  the  electric  ﬁeld.

Three  large,  square  conducting  plates  are  placed  parallel  to  one  another  as  shown.  The 
outer  plates  are  connected  by  a  conducting  wire.  A  total  charge  Q  is  placed  on  the  inner 
plate;  this  divides  in  an  amount  QT  on  the  top  of  the  inner  plate  and  QB  on  the  bottom  of 
the  inner  plate. 
The  side  length  of  the plates L  is  far  larger  than  the  separations  (L √ s, L √ x),  so you 
may  ignore  the  eﬀect  of  any  edge  eﬀects  in  this  problem. 
(a) Write  down  expressions  for  the  potential  diﬀerence  between  the  inner  plate  and  the  top 
plate,  and  between  the  inner  plate  and  the  bottom  plate. 
(b)  Calculate QT  and QB  in  terms  of Q,  x,  and  s. 
(c)  Calculate  the  total  energy  stored  in  the  electric  ﬁeld  of  this  conﬁguration  as  a  function 
of  x. 
(d)  Calculate  the  value  of  x  for  which  the  stored  energy  in  this  system  is  maximum.  (Hint: 
you can do  this with a  straightforward but moderately  tedious calculation.  Or, you can  look 
for  a  symmetry  and  think  about  what  happens  when  you  slightly  disturb  things  from  that 
symmetry.)

Consider  the  inﬁnitely  long  cylinder  below.  It  has  a  radius  R  and  a  thin  layer  of  charge 
per  unit  area  δ  pasted  to  its  surface.  This means  that  amount  of  charge  per  unit  length  on 
the  cylinder  is  � = 2�Rδ .  In  your  responses  below,  please  express  your  answers  in  terms  of 
�,  not  δ .

(c)  How much  work  does  it  take  to  squeeze  the  cylinder  so  that  its  radius  shrinks  by  �R?
