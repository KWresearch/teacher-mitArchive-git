Final  Examination 
Monday,  December  15,  2003,  09:00AM-11:00AM 

Total  points  in  the  exam  are  100.  ALL  problems  receive  equal  points  (25  each).  Work  on 
all problems.  Work  on problems  you  are most  comfortable with ﬁrst.  This  is  a  closed book 
and  closed  notes  exam.  An  equations  table  will  be  given  to  you. 

Problem  1 

You  come  across  a  spherically  symmetric  electric  ﬁeld  with  the  following  form: 
 r

�
0 � r � R 
rˆ

R − 2  rˆ
2R < r � 3R 
�2

3R < r � 4R 
rˆ
r 
r > 4R 

ωE (r) =  E0 
= 0 
=  E0 

=  E0 

= 0 

rˆ is  the  radial  unit  vector  in  spherical  coordinates. 

(a)  For  all  r,  what  is  the  charge Q(r)  contained  within  a  radius  r? 

(b)  Calculate  the  charge  density  �(r)  everywhere. 

(c)  Are  there  any  surface  charges  in  this  charge  distribution?  If  so,  identify  their  location 
and  give  the  magnitude  of  the  surface  charge density  �  at  each  such  location. 

(d)  The  charge  distribution  is  modiﬁed  in  some  way.  The  new  electric  ﬁeld  is

Compute  the  diﬀerence  in  energy between  this  and  the  old  conﬁguration, Unew − Uold .  Was 
work  done  on  the  system  or  did  the  system  do  work?

Problem  2 

The  circuit  illustrated  in  the  following  ﬁgure  is  driven  by  an  EMF  V 

= Vo ei�t 

. 

At  time  t1 ,  the  switch  is  closed  on A. 

(a)  Calculate  the  complex  impedance  ZX Y  of  the  circuit. 

(b) What  is  the  non-zero  frequency  �o  that  maximizes  the  average power  dissipated  in  the 
resistor R? 

3)  For  � = �o ,  what  is  the  average power  dissipated  in  the  resistor R? 

4) Calculate  IR ,  the  current ﬂowing  through  the  resistor R when � = �1  = 1/�2C L.  What

is  the  phase  between  IR  and  V  when  � = �1  = 1/�2C L?  Is  IR  leading  or  lagging V? 

At  time  t2 ,  the  switch  is  closed  on  B. 


5) What  is  the  complex  impedance  ZX Y  of  the  circuit  now? 

6) How  does  VR depend  on  the  frequency  �?  Draw  a  graph.
