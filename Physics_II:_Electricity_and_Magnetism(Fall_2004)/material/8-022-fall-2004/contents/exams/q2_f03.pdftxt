A  battery  E  with  internal  resistance   r,  two  resistors  R1  =  10r  and  R2  = 5r  and  two 
capacitors  C1  and  C2  with  C1  = 2C2  are  arranged  as  shown  in  the   ﬁgure  below.  The 
capacitors  are  initially  uncharged.  Express  all  your  answers  in  terms  of  E , r  and  C2 .

(a) At  t  = 0   the  switch  S  is  closed.  What   is  the   potential  at  A  with  respect   to  C  (i.e.,  
VAC   =  VA  −  VC )  and  what  is  the   potential  at  B  with  respect   to  C   (i.e.,  VBC  =  VB  −  VC )? 

(b)  After  inﬁnite  time  has  elapsed  (and  with  the  switch  S  remaining  closed)   what  is  VAC  = 
VA  −  VC  and  VBC   =  VB  −  VC ? 

(c) Write  down  a  set  of  independent  equations  that   will  yield the  solutions  for  the  currents 
ﬂowing in  the  three  branches  of the   circuit,  i.e.,  I0 (t), IR (t), IC (t).  Do  NOT   solve  them.  

We  now  short-circuit  points  A and  B of the  circuit  by connecting them  with a  resistanceless 
conducting  wire: 

(d)  Will  there  be  any  current  ﬂowing  through  it  (yes/no)   and  in  what  direction? 

(e) What  will  be  the  ﬁnal  VAC  =  VA  −  VC  and  VBC  =  VB  −  VC ? 

(f )  What  is  the  total  charge  that   ﬂew   through  the  short-circuiting  wire?   Is  this  consistent 
with  your  answer   in  (d)?

Square loop, each side L 

y 

x 

In  this  problem,  we  will  ﬁgure   out  how   conductivity transforms  between  frames  of reference. 

A  laboratory  is  ﬁlled with  a  material whose  conductivity is  σ .  An  electric  ﬁeld  of  magnitude  
E points  in  the  x direction. This  causes  a  current  to  ﬂow  normal to  a  square  loop with sides 
of  length  l. 

(a)  In  an  interval  of  time  Δt,  how  much  charge   Δq  ﬂows  through  the   loop?

This  laboratory  is  now  placed  on  a  large  train  that   is  moving  in  the  x direction  with  very  
large  velocity  v .  An  interval  of  time  Δt passes  on  the  train.  We   observe   all  of  this  as  the 
train  goes  past  us. 

(b) During  the  “train  time”  interval  Δt,  what  time  interval  Δt�  passes  according  to  us?  What 
area  A�  do  we  observe?  How  much  charge   Δq �  passes  through the   loop in  this  interval? 

(c) Using the  results  of  part  (b),  compute   the  current   density  J �  we  see. 

(d)  Using  the  result   of  part  (c)   plus  the   rule  for  transforming  electric  ﬁelds,  compute  the 
conductivity  σ �  that  we  measure. 

The  lab  is  now  taken  oﬀ  the  train  and  placed  on  an  elevator  which  climbs  upward,  in  the   y 
direction,  with the  same  very  large   velocity   v .  An  interval  of  time   Δt passes  on  the  elevator.  
We  observe  the  lab  go  past  us  while  standing  next   to  the   elevator  doors. 

(e)  During  the  “elevator  time”  interval   Δt,  what  time   interval  Δt�  passes  according  to  us? 
What area  A�  do  we  observe?  How   much charge   Δq �  passes  through  the  loop  in  this  interval? 

(f ) Using the  results  of  part  (e),  compute   the  current  density  J �  we  see. 

(g)  Using  the  result  of  part   (f )   plus  the   rule  for  transforming  electric  ﬁelds,  compute   the 
conductivity  σ �  that  we  measure.  Does  it   agree  with  your  result   for  part   (d)?  Should  it? 

(25   points) Problem  3 

A  coaxial  cable  consists  of  a   solid  inner   conductor  of  radius  R1  and  an  outer  concentric 
cylindrical tube  of  inner  radius  R2  and outer   radius  R3 . The  two  conductors  carry equal and 
opposite  currents  I0  which  however  are  not  uniformly   distributed  across  their  cross  sections,  
instead,  their   current  densities  J vary  linearly  with  distance   from  the   center,  i.e.,  J1  =  C1 r 
for   the  inner  one  and  J2  =  C2 r  for  the   outer   one   (where   C1  and  C2  are  constants).   Find 
the  magnetic  ﬁeld  at  a  distance   r from  the  axis  of the  cable  for  (a)   r < R1  (b)  R1  < r < R2 
(c)  R2  < r < R3  and  (d)   r > R3 .  Express  all  your  answers  in  terms  of  Io , R1 , R2  and  R3 .

A  conducting   ring  of  radius  R is  connected  to  two  exterior  wires  ending  at   the  two  ends  of 
a  diameter   as  shown  in  the  ﬁgure.  The  external  wires  are  straight  and  a  current   I  ﬂows 
through  them.  The   current  splits  into  unequal  portions  while   passing  through  the   ring  as 
shown  in  the  ﬁgure. What  is  the  �B ﬁeld  (magnitude  and  direction)   at   the  center  of  the  ring?
