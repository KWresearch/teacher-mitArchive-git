Solution  to  Quiz  #2 

PROBLEM  1  (9  pts)

Answer  the  following  questions,  justifying  your  answers  with  one  short  sentence.

(a)  Assume  that  lightbulbs  act  as  resistors  and  examine  the  following  two  circuits: 

V 

V 

C 

L 

Both  switches  are  closed  at  t  =  0.  Qualitatively  describe  the  behavior  of  the  lightbulbs  as 
time  passes. 
In the left circuit, current ﬂows until the charge builds on the capacitor, opposing 
the  battery.  In  the  right  circuit,  the  inductor  initially  opposes  current  ﬂow  — 
Lenz’s  law!  —  and  only  gradually  allows  the  current  to  ﬂow.  Hence,  the  left 
bulb  will  glow  brightly  and  then  fade  away.  The  right  bulb  will  start  out  dark 
and  gradually  get  brighter. 

(b)  A metal  ring  is  dropped  (feels  uniform  gravitational  acceleration  down)  into  a  region  of 
constant magnetic  ﬁeld,  pointing  out  of  the  page:

Describe  the  motion  of  the  ring  as  it  falls.  Be  sure  to  contrast  the  behavior  when  it  is  out 
of  the  ﬁeld,  when  it  is  partially  in  the  ﬁeld,  and  when  it  is  completely  in  the  ﬁeld. 
Lenz’s  law  tells  us  that  an  induced  current  will  ﬂow  when  there  is  a  changing 
magnetic ﬂux in the loop;  the direction of this ﬂow will be such that the magnetic 
force  on  the  current will  oppose  the  falling motion.  The  loop will  fall  freely  until 
it  starts  to  enter  the  magnetic  ﬁeld.  It  will  then  slow  down  very  suddenly  — 
falling  but  not  freely.  When  it  is  completely  inside  the  region,  it  will  again  fall 
freely  since  the  ﬂux  through  the  loop  no  longer  changes.  As  it  starts  to  leave  the 
region,  it  will  again  fall  slowly;  it  will  then  fall  freely  once  it  completely  leaves 
the  region. 
(c)  Is  ∂B  = B0zzˆ a  possible magnetic  ﬁeld?  If  so,  justify  your  statement.  If  not,  ﬁx  it. 
It  is  NOT  a  valid  ﬁeld:  Notice  that  ∂ B  ≥
∞ ·  ∂ = 0!  There  are  lots  of  ways  to  ﬁx  it. 
The  simplest  is  probably  to  include  a  component  along  the  x  or  y  directions  — 
e.g.,  put  ∂
B  = B0  (zzˆ − x ˆ
x). 

PROBLEM  2  (35  pts) 
In  this  problem,  you will  look  at  a  circuit  that  contains  a  constant  current  source:  the  total 
current  which  comes  out  of  this  device  is  always  I0  no  matter  what  EMF  is  required.  The 
switch  S  is  closed  at  t = 0. 
First,  this  source  is  hooked  up  to  a  pair  of  resistors  in  parallel: 

I0 

I1 

I2 

R1 

R2 

(a)  Find  the  EMF  E  produced  by  the  constant  current  source,  as  well  as  the  currents  I1

(ﬂowing  through  resistor  R1 )  and  I2  (ﬂowing  through  R2 ).

The resistors in parallel have an equivalent resistance given by 1/Req  = 1/R1+1/R2 ,

or  Req  = R1R2/(R1  + R2 ).  The  EMF  produced  by  the  current  source  is  thus


The  currents  through  the  two  resistors  are  given  by 

E  = 

I0R1R2
R1  + R2 

. 

I1  =

I2  =

E 
I0R2
= 
R1  R1  + R2 
E 
I0R1
= 
R2  R1  + R2 

. 

The  circuit  is  now  modiﬁed:  a  capacitor  and  a  switch  are  added.  The  capacitor  is  initially 
uncharged. 

S 

I0 

C 

I1 

I2 

R1 

R2 

The  switch  is  closed  at  t = 0. 
(b)  Find  the  initial  currents  I1 (t  =  0),  I2 (t  =  0),  and  the  late  time  currents,  I1 (t  ≤  �),

I2 (t ≤ �).  You should be able to do this with very little calculation.  (Express your answers

in  terms  of  I0  and  the  parameters  of  the  circuit.)

At  t  = 0,  there  is  no  charge  on  the  capacitor  and  it  behaves  identically  to  the

circuit  in  part  (a).  At  late  times,  the  capacitor  is  fully  charged  and  no  current

ﬂows  through  R2 . 

I1 (t = 0) = 

I0R2 
R1  + R2 
I1 (t ≤ �) = I0  , 

, 

I2 (t = 0) = 

I0R1 
R1  + R2 
I2 (t ≤ �) = 0  . 

(c) Use Kirchhoﬀ ’s  laws  to write down  two  equations  relating  I1 (t),  I2 (t),  I0 ,  and  the  charge 
on  the  capacitor Q.  Write  down  a  third  equation  relating Q  to  I2 . 

I0  = I1  + I2  ,

Q 
I1R1  − I2R2  − = 0  ,
C 

I2  = 

dQ
dt 

. 

(d)  Using  the  results  of  (c),  ﬁnd  the  late  time  charge,  Q(t ≤ �).  (Express  your  answer  in 
terms  of  I0  and  the  parameters  of  the  circuit.) 
For  t ≤ �  we  have  I2  = 0,  I1  = I0 .  Plugging  into  Kirchhoﬀ  and  solving  for  Q,  we 
ﬁnd 

Q
I0R1  − = 0 
C 
−≤ Q = I0R1C  . 

,  Q = F  + Ge−t/T3
(e)  Assume  I1 (t) = A + B e−t/T1 ,  I2 (t) = D + E e−t/T2 
from  parts  (b)  and  (c),  ﬁnd  A,  B , D,  E ,  F ,  and G. 

.  Using  your  results 

I1 (0) = A + B  =

I0R2
R1  + R2 

; 

−≤ A = I0  ,

I1 (�) = A = I0

I0R1
B  = −

I2 (0) = D + E  =

I2 (�) = D = 0 

−≤ D = 0  ,

E  = 

I0R1
R1  + R2 

Q(�) = F  = C I0R1 
Q(0) = F  + G = 0  ; 
−≤ F  = C I0R1  ,
G = −C I0R1 

(f )  Using  your  answers  to  parts  (c)  and  (e),  ﬁnd  T1 ,  T2 ,  and  T3 . 
Let’s  begin  with  I2  = dQ/dt: 

I2  = 

I0R1 
−t/T2
e 
R1  + R2 

; 

dQ 
dt 

= 

C I0R1
T3 

e −t/T3 

These  are  equal  at  t = 0  if 

T3  = C (R1  + R2 ) 

These  are  equal  for  ALL  t  if  T2  =  T3 .  Plugging  into  the  remaining  Kirchhoﬀ 
equation,  we  ﬁnd  that  everything  works  IF  we  also  choose  T1  = T3 .  So, 

T1  = T2  = T3  = C (R1  + R2 )  . 

(g) After  a  long  time,  the  switch  is  opened.  Find  the  total  energy  dissipated  in  the  resistors 
after  the  switch  is  opened.  Hint:  this  can  be  done  without  a  single  integral! 
It’s  the  energy  stored  in  the  capacitor:

PROBLEM  3  (20  pts) 
The  segment  of  wire  shown  below  is  oriented  along  the  x  axis,  has  a  total  length  L  and  a 
cross-sectional  area  A.  It  is  made  of  material  whose  conductivity  varies  along  the  wire  as 
�c (x) = �0 (L/x).  This segment of wire is connected to a battery using zero-resistance cables. 
The  battery  puts  out  an  EMF  V .

In what  follows,  assume  that  everything  is  in  a  steady  state  (φ �/φ t = 0),  and  that  the wires 
bring  current uniformly  to  and  from  the  ends of  the  segment.  ˆx points  from x = 0  to x = L. 
(a) What  is  the  resistance  R  of  the  wire  segment? 

Treat  the  segment  as  a  sequence  of  resistive  slabs  of  length  dx.  Each  slab  has

The  magnitude  of  the  current  density  is  J  = I /A.  Putting  all  this  this  together,

Consider  a  solid,  conducting  inﬁnitely  long  cylinder,  of  radius  R,  oriented  parallel  to  the  z -

zˆ and �ˆ are related by right-hand rule:  point your right-hand thumb along  ˆz , and your ﬁngers

Each line has charge/length 
λ0  in its rest frame 

Two  inﬁnite  lines  of  charge  with  charge  per  unit  length  σ0  in  their  rest  frame  are  separated 
by  a  distance  d.  These  charges  are moving  in  a  direction  parallel  to  their  length  with  speed 
v .  This  speed  could  be  close  to  the  speed  of  light!

the  bottom  line?  Give  direction  (up  or  down)  and magnitude. 
The  bottom  line  generates  an  electric  ﬁeld  of  magnitude
