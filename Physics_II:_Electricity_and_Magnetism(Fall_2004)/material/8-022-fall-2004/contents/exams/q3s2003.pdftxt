ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM 
QUIZ #3 from last year 
 
Problems on the final will be similar to those found here  – over 50% of the 
problems on the final will focus on material covered since the last quiz. For 
practice problems from earlier in the course, please refer back to practice 
exams 1 and 2 and the homework. 

Spring 2003 

 

 
There are five questions. Answer all of the questions. This is a closed book quiz 
 
Problem #1 (Magnetic Fluxes) (15 pts.) 
 
Find the total net magnetic flux from the small loop shown below that threads the large 
loop. The two loops have precisely the same center. The large loop has a radius b and the 
small loop has a radius a. You should consider a<<b. Hint: this problem does not involve 
doing any complicated integrals.

Problem #3 (Two capacitors and an inductor) (20pts) 
 
 
Consider the following circuit where C1 is initially charged to 75 V.  Suppose that C1 is 
10,000 mF, C2 is 3000 mF, and L is 15 H.  Explain how to open and close the switches so 
as to discharge C1 and charge C2.  Starting at t = 0, you should give explicitly times for 
opening and closing each switch.  What is the final voltage across C2 ?

Problem #5 (Poynting Vector in a Solenoid) (25pts) 
 
In the figure shown to the right, you are looking down the 
barrel of a solenoid. The solenoid is oriented so that a 
current I flowing in the coil produces a magnetic field 
pointing out of the page. Everywhere in this problem, you 
may use the assumption that the solenoid behaves as an 
infinite solenoid with infinitely tight windings.

a)   If the current running through the solenoid’s coil  is 
increasing at a constant rate, there will be an electric 
field inside the solenoid. Draw arrows in the figure above to represent the direction of 
this electric field.
