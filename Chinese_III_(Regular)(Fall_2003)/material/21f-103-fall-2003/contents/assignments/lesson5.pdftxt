Lesson 5: Weather and seasons

Classical Chinese – the original

sun behind-hills then rest 
Zài dì lǐ wā gè jǐng hē shuǐ,  at earth in dig a well drink water

translated into Modern Chinese 
 
 
 
 
Notice how Classical Chinese words not only often have different roots from their 
modern counterparts (yǐn – hē ‘drink,’ shí – chī ‘eat,’ both of which do survive in the 
common words for ‘drink’ and ‘eat’ in Cantonese), but they also tend more to single 
syllables (rì – tàiyang; zuò – gōngzuò; xī – xiūxi; hé - shénme). Almost all the words in 
the classical original above appear in the modern language, but often in compounds (yǐn 
> yǐnliào ‘beverages,’ xī > xiūxi ‘to rest’) or with different meanings (rì ‘day’ rather than 
‘sun’). 
 

 

 

A. Transitions 

 
 

We can’t rest because we still have lots 
of homework.  

1. Connecting sentences 
Conjunctions like kěshì, dànshì, and yīnwèi show logical relations between clauses: 
 
Wǒmen bù néng xiūxi, yīnwèi 
hái yǒu hěn duō gōngkè. 
 
 
When the subordinate clause (eg the yīnwèi clause) is placed first, the logical connection 
is often marked in the second clause as well. Here, we examine three such sets or paired 
connectors. 
 
a) Yīnwèi…suǒyǐ ‘because…so’ 
Yīnwèi is paired with suǒyǐ, whose literal meaning is ‘so’ or ‘therefore’; but in many 
cases, it has no explicit correspondence in an English translation. In the Chinese, when 
only one of the two connectors is present, it is more likely to be the second, eg suǒyǐ 
rather than yīnwèi. 
 
<Yīnwèi> tiānqì hěn rè suǒyǐ wǒmen  
dōu hěn lèi. 
 
 
 
 

Because the weather is so hot we’re all 
tired. 

 

122

They can’t buy a lot of things because they  
don’t have much money. 

Generally, conjunctions like yīnwèi and suǒyǐ precede the subject (yīnwèi tiānqi). But 
where a single subject persists through the sentence, then it may precede yīnwèi: 
 
Tāmen yīnwèi qián bú gòu suǒyǐ 
bù néng mǎi hěn duō dōngxi. 
 
b) Suīrán…kěshì / dànshì 
Roughly the same conditions apply to the pair suīrán … kěshì ‘although…but.’ And 
again, while English requires only the single conjunction ‘although’, Chinese often omits 
suīrán, leaving the only marking in the second clause. 
 
<Suīrán> fùmǔ shì Zhōngguó rén, dànshì   Although her parents are Chinese, she  
tā méi qù guo Zhōngguó. 
hasn’t been to China.  
 
 
 
Tā <suīrán> hěn è kěshì bù xiǎng chīfàn.  Although he’s hungry he doesn’t want to 
eat.  

 
c) Yàoshi…jiù 
The pair yàoshi …jiù ‘if…then’ is a little different. In the first place, jiù is an adverb and, 
unlike suǒyǐ or kěshì, has to be placed directly before a verb (or another adverb). In 
addition, jiù is more likely to be omitted (with slight change of nuance) than suǒyǐ or 
kěshì.  
 
Yàoshi qián bú gòu, nǐmen jiù yòng   
xìnyòngkǎ.  
 
 
 
 
 
Nǐ  yàoshi méi diànnǎo kěyǐ qù wǎngbā 
fā email. 
 
 
 
 
 
A slightly more formal alternative for yàoshi is rúguǒ: 
 
Rúguǒ nǐ bù xiǎng qù, nà jiù ràng wǒ qù. 
 
The conditional clause can also be implied either by the presence of jiù alone, or by the 
context: 
 
<Yàoshi> tiānqì bù hǎo, bù néng qù.   

If [you] don’t have enough money [cash], 
you can use a credit card.  

If you don’t have a computer, you can go 
to an internet cafe to send email.  

If you don’t want to go, then let me go. 

[If] the weather’s bad, [we] won’t be able to 
go. 
 
[If you] don’t have any money, use a credit 
card. 

<Yàoshi> méi qián jiù yòng xìnyòngkǎ. 

 
Both yàoshi and rúguǒ can be buttressed by the phrase de huà placed at the end of the 
clause. (Huà ‘word; speech’; cf. English ‘let’s say,’ or simply ‘say,’ used as a conditional 
in sentences such as ‘say it rains, then we meet inside’). 
 

 

123

If  you can’t go, then why don’t you phone. 

If you [happen to] have a computer, 
I have some Chinese software here. 

Yàoshi nǐ yǒu diànnǎo de huà, wǒ zhè lǐ 
yǒu yíge Zhōngwén ruǎnjiàn.  
 
 
Bù néng qù de huà, jiù dǎ ge diànhuà ba! 
 
Exercise.  
Choose a pair of conjoining words for the following sentences: 
 
1) Màikè Qiáodān shi ge dǎlánqiú de. Tā bù zěnme (‘so’) gāo. 
 
2) Tā hěn lèi. Tā bù néng gōngzuò (‘work’). 
 
3) Tā bú ràng (‘let’) wǒ kàn diànshì (‘TV’). Wǒ bú ràng tā tīng yīnyuè. (‘listen music’) 
 
 
  
4) Zhōngwén kè hěn nán. Zhōngwén kè hěn yǒu yìsi. 
 
5) Xuéshēng hěn duō. Lǎoshī hěn gāoxìng.  
 
6) Nǐ hē tài duō kāfēi. Nǐ yídìng hěn jǐnzhāng. 
 
2. Counting revisited 
English distinguishes countable nouns – those that can be counted directly – from mass 
nouns – those that are counted by way of measures. People, tables, occasions are all 
countable (as shown by the presence of the plural ‘s’) while air, vegetation, caffeine and 
research are not. The latter have to be measured out: ‘three canisters of air’, ‘four 
ampules of caffeine’ etc. In Chinese, all nouns behave like mass nouns and, when 
counted, have to be ‘measured out’ with ‘measure words’. Strictly speaking, one can 
distinguish measures and classifiers. The former, typically, have a counterpart in English: 
gallon (of water); slab (or butter); block (of apartments). The latter do not. For simplicity, 
we will refer to both as Measures. 
 

  

Measures follow numbers (as well as demonstratives such as zhè and nà), and can 
be followed by, or more typically can substitute for, a set of nouns. In Chinese, one 
measure, gè, is particularly versatile, occurring with a range of animate and inanimate 
nouns – almost as a default measure. In many cases, the selection of one measure over 
another can provide different shades of meaning, eg, with kè, mén ‘course’ versus táng 
‘class.’ 
 
yì mén kè, liǎng mén kè, sān mén kè 
kè:  
kè: 
yì táng kè, liǎng táng kè, sān táng kè 
person: yí ge rén, liăng ge xuéshēng, sān ge péngyou, sì ge dìdi 
 
qián:   yí kuài qián, liăng kuài, sān kuài; shí kuài, shísì kuài, èrshíyī kuài, yìbăi kuài qián 
lĭbài:  yí ge lĭbài, liăng ge lĭbài, sān ge lĭbài, sì ge lĭbài 
xīngqī: yí ge xīngqī, liăng ge xīngqī, sān ge xīngqī, sì ge xīngqī 
yuè: 
yí ge yuè, liăng ge yuè, sān ge yuè, sì ge yuè 

 

124

 
Not all measures have associated nouns. Tiān and nián  - but not lĭbài/xīngqī and yuè – 
are measures without nouns: 
 

tiān:  yì tiān, liǎng tiān, sān tiān, sì tiān 
nián:  yì nián, liǎng nián, sān nián, sì nián 

There are also measures that substitute not for nouns but for verbal events – these 
are called verbal measures, eg cì ‘times’ and biàn ‘time (viewed as a duration)’: 
 

yí cì   liăng cì   sān cì   sì cì   wŭ cì   liù cì   qī cì   bā cì 
yí biàn, liăng biàn, sān biàn.  [Qĭng zài shuō yí biàn.] 

 
 

 

 

‘one time’ 
 
‘once through’  

 
And cf. the ordinal series: 
 

‘first time’ 

 

dìyī cì, dì'èr cì, dìsān cì, dìwŭ cì 

 

 

Measure words are only occasionally encountered in these early lessons, so we 
can begin by simply reciting the phrases above and getting used to the form. Later, we 
will have more occasion to encounter them in discourse. 
 
 
3. How many; how much: 
The two words that question amounts – that are answered by a number - are duōshao and 
jĭ. They differ both in their syntax and meaning. Duōshao does not usually require a 
following measure word (such as gè); jĭ does. Duōshao does not anticipate a particular 
number; jĭ anticipates relatively few. Thus, asking about the number of students in a 
dormitory you would use duōshao; but asking about the number of siblings in a family 
you would use jĭge. Examples: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Tā zhù duōshao hào?   
 
What number does she live at? 
Jīntiān de kè yǒu duōshao xuéshēng? How many students in today’s class? 
 
Tā jĭ suì? 
 
Yǒu jĭ mén kè? 
Jīntiān yǒu jĭ táng? 

How old is he? [to a child] 
How many courses? 
How many classes today? 

There are some apparent exceptions to the use of jĭ. Sports scores, for example - 
even basketball scores, which involve high numbers – tend to be queried with jĭ: jĭ bǐ jĭ? 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

The special nuance of jĭ is reflected in its function as an indefinite, where it has 
gained a special meaning of ‘a few; several.’ 
 
 
 
 
 

I only have a few. 

Wŏ zhǐ yǒu jĭge.

4. Time words  
In earlier lessons we have encountered a number of time words, so here we enlarge the 
repertoire and present them in a synoptic table. Recall that, unlike in English, time words 
precede their associated verbs: 
 
 
 
qiántiān 
qiánnián 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. Shénme shíhou ‘when’ – more examples: 
 
Nĭ shénme shíhou dào Bĕijīng qu? 
Wŏ lĭbài’èr dào Bĕijīng qu, lĭbàiliù 
dào Tiānjīn<g> qù.  
 
 
 
Nĭ shénme shíhou shàng kè?   
Wŏ jīntiān méiyou kè.  
 
 
Nĭ shì shénme shíhou lái de?   
Wŏ shì shàngge xīngqīliù lái de. 
 

When are you going to Beijing? 
I’m going to Beijing on Tuesday and  
to Tianjin on Saturday.  

When does class begin? 
I don’t have any classes today. 

When was it you came? 
I came last Saturday. 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

In regions where Cantonese influence is strong (including Singapore and other 
parts of Southeast Asia), the Cantonese expression for ‘when’ gives rise to Mandarin jĭshí 
‘which time’: 
 
Tā jĭshí qù Jílóngpō?

‘have to; must’ [only in positive] 
‘needn’t’ 
[only in negative] 
‘ought; should; have to’ 
‘should; have to; need; to require’ 
‘need to’ 
‘need; obligatory; necessary’ [mostly in a few common phrases] 

 
7. ‘Ought’ and ‘must’ 
There are a number of common verbs that convey notions of obligation and necessity: 
 
 
děi  
búbì  
 
<yīng>gāi 
xūyào   
 
bìxū 
bìyaò 
 
 
Míngtiān wǒ děi qù Niǔ Yuē   
kàn mǔqin. 
 
 
 
 
Búbì dōu qù, yí ge rén qù jiù xíng le. No need for you all to go, one will do. 
 
Wǒ děi qù, kěshì nǐmen búbì qù. 
 
Nǐ yīnggāi xiūxi. 
 
Míngtiān yǒu kǎoshì, wǒ gāi   
qù túshūguǎn xuéxí. 
 
 
 
Zhōumò yǒu kèrén lái, wǒ xūyào qù  We’re having guests on the weekend, 
shāngdiàn mǎi chī de dōngxi.   
[so] I need to go to the store to buy s/t to eat.  
 
Rúguǒ nǐ yào xuéxí Zhōngwén 
nǐ bìxù yǒu yì běn zìdiǎn. 
 
 
Bú bìyào de máfan / shǒuxù.   
 
8.  Intensifiers 
Certain SVs occur in common phrases with intensifying adverbs such as tǐng ‘quite; very’ 
and mǎn ‘perfectly.’ Mǎn is pronounced on the low tone (as shown), and is usually 
written with the character for ‘full’ (滿), but in some cases it is written with a character 
that represents a word with rising tone, mán, meaning ‘fierce’ (蠻) [cf. English colloquial 
expressions such as ‘raining something fierce’]. The confusion may have come about 
because of the tone shift before common words like hǎo, which results in 
indistinguishable rising tones for both. Regardless of etymology (and character), usage 
for both tǐng and mǎn is rather idiosyncratic; expressions with mǎn or tǐng often show a 
final de (sometimes called situational-de): tǐng hǎo de ‘perfect; great.’ The two adverbs 
are most common with a few positively oriented SVs: 

If you want to study Chinese, you need to 
have a dictionary.  
 
 

Tomorrow [there’]s a test, I should 
go to the library to study 

Unnecessary bother / procedures. 

 

127

Măn hǎo de. 
 
Măn bú cùo de. 
Măn shūfu de.  

Great! 
Terrific! 
[It’]s really comfortable. 

Tǐng hǎo de! 
 
Tǐng lěng de.   
Tǐng yǒu yìsi de! 

Great! 
Freezing! 
Interesting! 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

Another intensifier is –jíle, added to a SV: Hǎo jíle! Rè jíle! Jí’s original meaning 
is an axis – cf. Běijí ‘North Pole’- but it was extended to mean ‘extreme’; thus ‘to the 
max!’ Jíle is quite productive and can follow almost any SV to mean ‘very SV.’  
 
 
 
 
 
 

Excellent! 
The weather’s hot! 
Delicious! 

Hǎo jíle! 
 
Tiānqì rè jíle!   
 
Hǎochī jíle! 

B. Dialogue on weather and seasons 
It is early summer in Beijing, and students are leaving for the break. Jiǎ is a student from 
abroad, studying in China. Yǐ is a resident.

C. Analysis 

 
1. Backing off: Yǒu yìdiǎnr SV 
Rather than answering a yes-no question with a clear positive response (Nǐ lèi ma? Hěn 
lèi!) or an intensified response (lèi jíle, mǎn shūfu), you may want to back off a bit and 
answer ‘quite’ or ‘a bit.. The construction is yǒu <yì>diǎnr + SV ‘have a-bit SV’ – the yi 
is often elided. Taiwan and other southern Mandarin regions, which have an aversion to 
the final ‘r’ sound, say yǒu yìdiǎn SV. [Note the presence of yǒu in the Chinese, with no 
direct correspondence in the English equivalent!] 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
2. The seasons 
Though not all parts of China enjoy four seasons, most parts do, and Chinese recognizes 
four seasons (sìgè jìjié or sìjì). Names for seasons end with –tian. 
 
 
 

I’m kind of busy today. 
It’s rather hot today. 
We’re a bit hungry. 
Summer’s a bit humid. 
(S)he’s a bit weird. 
[In] Xi’an, autumns are a bit cold. 
You look a bit like your wife.

Xī’ān, qiūtiān yǒu (yì)diǎnr lěng. 
Nǐ yǒu diǎnr xiàng nǐ tàitai. 
 

 

 
3. Yòu…yòu…(又…又) 
Yòu, with falling tone has a core meaning of ‘once again,’ but yòu reiterated before a pair 
of verbs – more commonly SVs – often translates as ‘both…and’ or simply ‘and’: 
 
Yòu kuài yòu shūfu. 
 
 
[It’]s fast and comfortable. 
Tired and anxious. 
 
Yòu lèi yòu jĭnzhāng.   
 
 
Yòu lèi yòu è.

Beijing[‘s] summer is hot, 
[and] winter’s cold. 

[In] Canton, the winter’s aren’t  
cold, the summers are hot and humid. 

Tianjin’s comfortable in spring 
[and] autumns not bad either. 

Kunming’s weather’s great - 
four seasons like spring. 

 
4. Bǐjiào + SV 
Bǐjiào (and colloquially, bǐjiǎo) is a particularly common adverb that appears mostly 
before SVs with the meaning of ‘rather; relatively [more]’: 
 

Fēijī bǐjiào shūfu. 
Planes are more comfortable. 
 
 
Báitiān bǐjiào rè, yèli bǐjiào liáng.  Days are relatively warm, nights rather cool.  

 
 
5. Weather  
China’s geographical configuration, with a vast continental mass to its west and a large 
body of water to the east results in high pressure air masses over Mongolia in the winter 
(where the cold air contracts and becomes denser) and lower pressure ones over the ocean 
(which retains heat longer).  As the continental land mass heats up through the spring, the 
high pressure is relieved (as air expands) while the air over the ocean (which is slower to 
heat) remains relatively higher density. These pressure differentials give rise to the 
monsoons (jìfēng in Chinese, ‘season-wind’): the winter monsoon bringing cold, dry air 
from the north and northwest, the summer monsoon, bringing warm, moist air from the 
ocean (and giving rise to heavy fogs along the northern coasts). As a result, winters in 
Beijing are cold and windy, but there is little snow.  
 

The effect of the two monsoons is mitigated by mountain ranges, which protect 
the south from the cold dry winter monsoon, and the north – and to some degree the 
northeast - from the moisture of the summer one. Rainfall in Beijing (in the northeast) 
varies considerably from year to year, but is heaviest in July and August. Southern 
regions, south of the Jīnlíng mountain range (which runs south of the Yellow River, and 
south of Xī’an), have heavier rainfall, much of it between May and October. South of the 
Nánlíng range (which runs along the northern boundary of Canton province) the weather 
is subtropical, with no real winter season. On the Tibetan plateau, on the other hand, the 
winters are long and summer virtually nonexistent.  
 
a) Weather 
The ordinary word for weather is tiānqì, composed of ‘sky’ plus ‘qì.’ The root qì is 
important in Chinese physiology and medicine, and is familiar to English speakers as the 
first syllable for the word qìgōng, the name of a system of breathing exercises. Qì is 
sometimes translated as ‘spirit’ or ‘essence.’ It appears in a range of words having to do 
with weather (tiānqì, qìhòu ‘climate’) and mood (qìfēn ‘ambiance’ and shēngqì ‘get 
angry’ – ie ‘give rise to qì’). 
 

Jīntiān tiānqì zěnmeyàng? 
 
Zuótiān tiānqì bú cùo.  
 
Bōshìdùn tiānqì hái kěyǐ! 
 
Lúndūn tiānqì bù lěng bú rè.   

What’s the weather like today? 
The weather’s not bad today. 
The weather in Boston is okay. 
The weather in London’s neither too 
hot, nor too cold. 
The weather’s very comfortable in Km.

b) Rain and precipitation 
Corresponding to English ‘it’s raining,’ Chinese has xià yǔ, literally ‘falls rain.’ English 
provides an ‘ambient’ subject (‘it’) and treats rain as a verb. Chinese, on the other hand, 
represents the same notion with a verb of motion, xià, and a noun, yǔ – the latter placed 
after the verb. Some other kinds of precipitation follow the same pattern: xià xuě ‘(fall 
snow) to snow,’ xià wù ‘(fall fog) to be foggy.’  
 

 
 

Look, it’s raining. 
Nĭ kàn, xià yǔ le! 
 
 
From June to August, it often rains 
Bĕijīng cóng liùyuè dào bāyuè  
chángcháng xià yǔ. 
in Beijing.  
 
 
Dōngtiān hĕn lĕng, dànshì bù cháng  The winter’s are cold, but it rarely snows. 
xià xuě.  
Yào xià yǔ ma? 
 
Jiùjīnshān cháng xià wù. 
 
Notes:  
Paradoxically – given the fact that Chinese frequently omits subject pronouns 
where English requires them - English ‘look’ is often rendered with the subject 
pronoun in Chinese: Nĭ kàn.  
The final le ‘new situation’ in the first example suggests either that (a) it is just 
starting to rain, or (b) the speaker is just becoming aware that it is raining. 
Cháng or chángcháng ADV ‘often’ 
Yào ‘want’ but in this context ‘will; be about to’ 

Is it going to rain? 
It’s often foggy in SF. 

 
c) Sun and wind 
Weather reports often mention the sun tàiyang, literally ‘the great yang’ – yáng being the 
counterpart to yīn, the male and female polarities. (While there is a regional word, tàiyīn 
‘the great yin’ for ‘moon, the standard word does not incorporate yīn. Rather it is 
composed of yuè ‘moon’ – familiar to you as the word for ‘month’ – and liàng ‘light’: 
yuèliàng.) Weather reports use tàiyang in the slightly extended meaning of ‘sunlight’ or 
‘sunshine’: tàiyang hěn hǎo ‘it’s sunny.’ However, expressions like méiyou tàiyang or 
yǒu hěn duō tàiyang, which seem natural enough in English, are rather awkward in 
Chinese and should be used warily (see below). In the dialogue, méi yángguāng ‘no 
sunlight’ is used instead.  
 

Wind is fēng. The semantic spread of the word fēng is interesting. It incorporates 
notions such as ‘landscape’ (fēngjǐng ‘scenery,’ as well as the geomantic practice known 
as fēngshuǐ) and ‘personal bearing’ (yǒu fēngdù ‘have poise’), ‘style’ (fēngliú 
‘notorious’, with the positive tone of ‘reknowned’ for men, and the negative tone of 
‘common’ for women), ‘custom’ (fēngsú ‘social customs’) and ‘taste’ (fēngwèi ‘flavor’). 
 
Examples 
Nánjīng, mĕitiān dōu hĕn rè kĕshì méiyou  
tàiyáng – shì huīmēngmēngde! 
 

It’s hot every day in Nanjing, but there’s 
no sun – it’s hazy.  

 

132

Bĕijīng chūntiān fēng hĕn dà, tù hĕn duō. 

 
Zuótiān tiānqì bú tài hǎo - fēng tài dà! 

In the spring, the wind’s strong and there’s a 
lot of dust. 

The weather wasn’t very good yesterday – 
too much wind.  
 

 
d) Hot and humid 
Winter temperatures in China show vast variation between north and south: thus the 
mean temperature in January for Beijing in the northeast is –4.6C/23.7F and for Canton 
in the southeast is 13.5C/56.3F. But mean summer temperatures in north and south differ 
rather little. The mean average in July in Beijing is 26.0C/78.8F, in Canton, it is 
28.3C/82.9F. Temperature is expressed in dù ‘degrees’ Celsius (Shèshì). In the summer, 
most of the heavily populated parts of China are hot and humid, or ‘muggy’: mēnrè, 
literally ‘close; stuffy (eg of a room)’ and ‘hot.’  
 
  
 
 
 
e) The order of sentence elements in Chinese 
 

Canton (city)’s very humid – 30 in the  
daytime, 25 at night! 
23C is 73F, right? 

Guǎngzhōu hěn mēnrè, báitiān 
sānshí dù, yèlǐ èrshíwŭ dù! 
 
Shèshì 23 dù shì Huáshì 73 dù ba. 

(time/place ~ subject) adverb--verb 

Jīntiān wǒ hěn máng.   
Wǒ jīntiān hěn máng.   

(about the situation today) 
(about the speaker) 

 
Time/place and subject may reverse positions, but the rest of the order is fixed. Typically, 
first position in a Chinese sentence introduces the topic: jīntiān tiānqì...let’s talk about 
today--what’s the weather like? The less frequently seen order, tiānqì jīntiān.... would 
suggest ‘we’re talking about weather--what’s today’s like’--contrasting it with 
yesterday’s, perhaps. Compare the following: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
f) Dialogue.  Talking informally about the weather: 
 
Jiǎ  
 
Yǐ  
 
 
 
Jiǎ  Wǒmen qù zǒuyizǒu ba. 
 

[It] is, the weather’s very good, 
neither [too] cold nor [too] hot, [it]’s 
[nice and] comfortable.  

(about him or her) 
[LE here, marks the change of state] 
(contrasting the two days) 

Tā zuótiān bù shūfu, jīntiān hǎo le. 
 
 
 
 
 
Zuótiān tā bù shūfu, jīntiān hǎo le. 

Shì a, tiānqì fēicháng hǎo, 
bù lěng bù rè, hěn shūfu. 
 
 
 
 

Jīntiān tiānqì zhēn bu cùo. 

Nice weather we’re having today! 

Why don’t we take a walk?! 

 
 

 

 
 
 

 

 

133

Aiya, bù xíng, wǒ tài máng le! 

Ei, máng shénme ya?!   
Lái xiūxi xiūxi ba! 
 

Hǎo, hǎo, zánmen zǒu ba. 

 
 

 

Oh, no way, I’m too busy! 

Hey, busy  [about] what? Come on, 
take a break. 

Okay, let’s go then! 

Yǐ. 
 
Jiǎ 
 
 
Yǐ 
 
fēicháng  
tài…le 

zǒuzou  

máng  

unusually; extremely; very (not-often)  
tài ‘very’ attracts le in the positive, the notion being that a boundary has 
been crossed – ‘a change of state.’ 
verbs of intentional action (zǒu, kàn, xiě but not yǒu, for example) can be 
reduplicated (without tone) for a casual or tentative effect: zǒuzou ‘take a 
walk’; kànkan ‘take a look; try [it] out.’ An intrusive yi ‘one’ restores the 
tone on the second syllable, but does not change the meaning: zǒuyizǒu 
‘(walk one walk) take a walk’; cf. zhuànyizhuàn ‘take a stroll.’ Xiūxi 
‘rest’ reduplicates as xiūxi xiūxi ‘take a break,’ but being a two-syllable 
verb, does not allow an intrusive yi. 
máng appears in some common expressions with an object, as here: Máng 
shénme? ‘Busy [with] what?’  

 
 
 

 
6. Future events 
It is clear from many of the examples in earlier lessons that neither past nor future events 
require explicit grammatical indication in Chinese: 
 

The weather was hot yesterday. 
It’s hot today too. 
Tomorrow I’m going to ‘Yellow Mountain.’ 

 
Zuótiān tiānqì hěn rè.   
 
Jīntiān yě hěn rè. 
 
Míngtiān wǒ dào Huángshān qù. 
 
 
 
 
 
English, on the other hand, usually registers a past event or state with the past 
tense form of the verb (was), while the future is often only implied (‘am going to,’ which 
has present tense form). However, in Chinese, there are some situations involving future 
events that do have to be explicitly indicated. The last of the three sentences above 
registers an intention – something the speaker has some control over. But that sentence 
had been about weather, then it would have been a prediction, something over which the 
speaker had no control. As such it would have required a huì: 
 
 
 
 

 
Míngtiān yě huì hěn rè. 
Huì bú huì xià yǔ? / Bú huì ba. 

Tomorrow will be hot too! 
Will it rain? / I don’t think so! 

Huì has a spread of meanings that includes ‘be skilled at,’ ‘to meet,’ and ‘be 
likely to.’ It is the last one that is associated with predictive sentences. Huì, once learned, 
tends to get over used, at least by speakers of English. It does not translate all cases of 
‘will’ and should be used warily. The notion of ‘prediction’ will help.  
 

The verb yào, with a root meaning of ‘want,’ can also be used with impending 
future events, in the sense of ‘about to; going to; soon.’ In such cases, it often attracts the 

 

134

new situation le. [The addition of adverbs to the yào pattern can moderate the sense of 
immediacy; yào alone (with or without le) suggests ‘soon’ but not right away. Kuài yào 
…le ‘quickly want’ suggests ‘very soon.’] 
 
 
 
 

We’re about to eat.  
 
Wǒmen yào chī fàn le. 
She’s getting ready for bed, can it wait 
 
Tā yào shuì jiào, míngtiān 
zài shuō, hǎo bù hǎo.    
until tomorrow? 
 
Wǒmen yào qù jīchǎng jiē tāmen le.  We’re leaving for the airport soon to meet 
 them.

7. More on DE 
We have seen DE used in a variety of contexts: wǒ de, zuótiān de, IBM de, něinián shēng 
de? (a special use). In this lesson DE shows up in the dialogue linking a modifying phrase 
(bú tài qīngchǔ) to a noun (tiānqì.) The modifying phrase is longer, but de functions in 
the familiar way. Notice that with modifiers, where English uses a that-phrase (or who-
phrase) the order of elements in the two languages is different; where English uses an 
adjectival phrase, the order is more or less the same. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The construction is not limited to SV modifiers. Phrases with de + nèige ‘that one; that’ 
are particularly common. Recall that the demonstratives zhè and nà change their form 
slightly when in combination with a measure word: nà > nèige; zhè > zhèige; and nǎ > 
něige. 
 
Qǐng wèn: 
 
 
 
 
- kàn bào de <nèige> rén shì shéi? 
 
- mǎi dōngxi de <nèige> rén shì shéi? 
- jiē xuéshēng de <nèige> rén shì shéi? 
 

Excuse me: 
who’s the person reading the paper? 
who’s the person buying stuff? 
who’s the person meeting the students? 

weather that isn’t clear 
ugly landscape 
teachers who aren’t strict 
smart students 

What sort of a person is the one playing bb? 

In principle – and particularly in colloquial speech - it is possible to place the 
demonstrative, nèige first: 
 
Nèi ge <dǎ lánqiú de> shì shénme rén? 
 
And in the right context, either nèige, or even nèige rén can be omitted: 
 
Dǎ diànhuà de shì wǒ de lǎoshī. 
Wánr diànnǎo de shì tóngxué.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The one telephoning is my teacher.  
The person playing with the computer is  
a classmate.

7. Interjections (cf. ejaculations, expletives, exclamations) 
Few textbooks – or grammars of Chinese – have much to say about interjections. 
However, they are quite frequent in informal speech, and need to be considered. The list 
below is tentative; as you observe Chinese speaking, you can add or amend it.  
 

Interjections are conventionalized carriers of emotion, typically providing context 
for a following sentence; cf. English: aha (recognition), yikes (surprise and fear), 
whoopee (happiness). Interjections sometimes employ sounds outside the regular 
linguistic system, such as the English alveolar clicks, conventionally spelled tsk tsk or tut 
tut (disapproval).  
 

Oh [I see] 

O (falling) 

A (falling) 

Ai (falling) 

Ng ~ M ~ uhn  (falling) 

weak assent; acknowledgement; uh huh 

Though they may occur elsewhere, interjections in Chinese are more frequent in 
initial position – or rather, prior position; though they often have a fixed intonation, it is 
not quite the same as the pitch and contour of the regular tones. Here are some examples: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Goodness; gosh; wow! [something unexpected] 
[A slightly stronger version.] 
Yikes; oh dear. Surprise, probably related to ai yo. 
Wow! [more southern, Taiwan?] 

Aiya  
 
Aiyo [yaw] 
 
Yo 
Wa 
 

Ah! Mild interest. 

resignation 

Wei ~ wai 

Ha! [satisfaction] 

Ha (falling, s/t abrupt)  

hello [telephoning; calling to someone] 

 
 
 
 
 
 
9. When in doubt:  
As noted earlier, Chinese differs from English is not requiring the presence of a form of 
the verb ‘to be’ to make adjectives into full predicates. Thus the meaning of lèi is 
‘be+tired’ not just ‘tired.’ 
 
 
 
 
However, responses of all kinds – whether involving a SV or ordinary Verb – can be 
questioned or reasserted by inserting shì or shì bu shi, as the following examples show: 
 

Nǐ lèi ma?  Nǐ lèi bu lei? 
Wǒ hěn lèi. 
 
 

Are you tired? 
I am.  

 

 

 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 

 

 
 

 

Nǐ shì bu shi hěn lèi?   
Shì, wǒ shì hěn lèi. 
 

 
 

Is it the case that [you]’re tired? 
Yes, I am. 

 

 

136

 
 
  
 
 
 

 

 

Míngtiān nǐ shì bu shì yǒu hěn 
duō gōngkè? 
 
 
 
Bù, míngtiān méiyou gōngkè.  

Do you [indeed] have a lot of  
homework tomorrow? 
No, [I] don’t have any home- 
work tomorrow. 

 
Shì bu shi in such sentences questions an underlying assumption: ‘They say she’s strict. 
Is she?’ Shì in the response confirms it. These ‘confirming’ shì’s are also common as a 
way of questioning adverbs:  
 

Wǒmen shì bú shì yídìng děi qù?  

Is it the case that we HAVE to go?’   

 

 

 
 
 

Wǒmen shì bú shì dōu děi qù? /  
Bù, nǐ yíge rén qù jiù xíng le.  

Do we ALL have to go? / 
No, it’s okay to go alone. 

 
Of course, if shì is the main verb of the sentence, then a yes-no question and 
corresponding answer may be formed in the usual way: 
 
 

Tā shì bushi nǐ gēge?   
Shì, tā shì wǒ gēge. 
 

 
 

Is he your brother? 
Yes, he is. 

D. More on names 

1. Jiào with two objects 
As noted in the last dialogue, jiào can take two objects with the meaning ‘call someone 
something’: 
 
 
 

 
Wŏmen jiào tā Chén lăoshī. 
 
Dàjiā dōu jiào tā lăo fūzĭ. 
 
Zhōngguó rén jiào tā fēirén. 
Nĭ jiào tā shémme? 
 
 
Péngyou dōu jiào wŏ xiăo Míng. 

We call him ‘Chen laoshi.’ 
Everyone calls him ‘the studious one.’ 
The Chinese call him the ‘Flying Man.’ 
What do you call her? 
Friends call me ‘young’ Míng. 

Wŏmen guăn tā jiào lăoshī. 
Tāmen guăn tā jiào fàntŏng. 

 
 

A more colloquial form of this construction makes use of the verb guăn whose 
root meaning (as a verb) is ‘be in charge of’: 
 
 
 
 
Exercise 
He’s very strict, so we call him ‘the boss.’ 
She’s my mother’s sister, so we call her ‘auntie.’ 
Because Mr. Chen’s a director, people call his wife ‘Madame’ Chen. 
Because he’s rather old, we call him ‘lǎodàye.’ 
Although she’s not a teacher, we still call her Professor Liào. 

We call her ‘teacher.’ 
They call him ‘rice bucket.’ (ie ‘big eater’) 

 

137

 

 

 

 

  Excuse me, sir/madame, how should 
  you be addressed? 
You can call me Prof. Yang.  

2. Finding out how to address someone. 
Frequently, in talking to someone with status, it’s not clear what form of address is 
appropriate. At such times a direct inquiry will help, using the verb chēnghu ‘call or 
address,’ or as is appropriate in this context, ‘be called; be addressed’: 
 
Jiă.  Qĭng wèn, nín zĕnme chēnghu? 
 
Yĭ   Nĭmen jiào wŏ Yáng lăoshī jiù hăo le. 
 
3. Xiăo, lăo and dà prefixed to names: 
a) Good friends may address one another with the friendly appellatives xiăo ‘(small) 
young’, lăo ‘old,’ and occasionally, dà ‘big,’ placed before a surname. In addition, 
families will sometimes use xiăo, and occasionally dà in front of the last syllable of a 
given name. Here are some examples: 
 
full name 
 
Bái Sùzhēn 
 
Zhāng Dàmíng 
 
Liáng Àimín 
 
Wáng Zhìzhì   
 

(xiăo Míng)   Zhāng jīnglĭ 

fem.  xiăo Liáng 

with title (formal) 

Wáng xiānshēng 

male  dà Wáng 

male 

lăo Zhāng 

sex 

informal 

xiăo Zhēn 

Bái lăoshī 

xiăo Mín 

Liáng zhŭrèn 

dà Zhì   

intimate 

 

fem.   xiăo Bái 

The choice of xiăo, lăo or dà depends on a number of factors, including age, 
physical appearance, and personality. Older males, and occasionally, older females can 
be referred to as lăo + surname: lăo Wáng; lăo Wèi. Younger males and females may be 
called xiăo + surname or, among family, xiăo + last syllable of míngzi: xiăo Máo; xiăo 
Míng; xiăo Zhēn. And a tall person, particularly to distinguish him from another (shorter) 
person with the same surname, may be called dà: dà Chén, dà Bái. But foreigners should 
be wary of using such appellatives, and use name + title, full name, or míngzi when 
addressing Chinese unless explicitly told to use a more informal or intimate form by a 
Chinese friend. 
 

E. Narrative 
Now that sufficient vocabulary is available, we can present narratives along with 
dialogues in each lesson. Narratives have the advantage of providing a lot of vocabulary 
in context, that makes it easier to recall.  
 

The following is a short narrative incorporating some of the vocabulary and 
sentence patterns from the first five lessons. Though restrictions on vocabulary make it a 
little stilted, the way phrases are simply juxtaposed to form strings is quite natural in 
colloquial speech (though less so in writing) and contrasts with English that usually 
requires more explicit marking. Once you have read the passage through a few times, you 
should translate it carefully, making sure that the English reads naturally. Once you are 

 

138

satisfied with your translation, use it to back-translate into Chinese and see if you can 
learn to retell the story with some fluency.

Yé hēn lěng    or 

Láo Lī yě | hén hǎo. 

Wó yě | hén xiǎng | dá dǔnr.      

 
3. More than two low tones in a phrase 
We have now gained enough low toned words to meet strings of more than two. Observe 
how the following are realized:  
 
1. Yě hěn lěng. 
 
2. Wǒ yě hěn kě. 
 
 
 
3. Lǎo Lǐ yě hěn hǎo.   
 
4. Wǒ yě hěn xiǎng dǎ dǔnr!   
    I  too  very  want  doze 
 
The second and fourth examples both have an even number of words (syllables). In such 
cases, the phrasing tends to be in pairs (as indicated) and the familiar tone shift takes 
place. But in (1) and (3), where the number of syllables is odd, there may be several 
options (as seen in the first example): either the phrase is divided into two moras (yě | hén 
lěng), in which case the regular rule applies to the second. Or – especially in fast speech - 
the three form a tonal unit, with the first rising (normally), the second staying high, and 
the third low – as shown.  
 
 
 
 
 
4. The r-suffix: 
A very few words in standard Mandarin always occur with an -r final: 
 
 
 
 
 

 
érzi  
èr 
 
ĕrduō    

‘child’ 
‘two’ 
‘ear’ 

Yé hēn lěng. 

 

 
 
 

 
 
 

However, a  large number of words occur with  the  r-final  in  the  speech of Beijing 
and  other  parts  of  the  northern Mandarin  speaking  area. Most  of  these  are  nouns:  kòngr 
‘spare time’; píngr ‘bottle’, wányìr ‘toys’, diànyĭngr ‘films’, ménkŏur ‘doorway’, xīnyănr 
‘heart;  cleverness’, wéizuĭr  ‘a bib’, xìngrénr  ‘almonds’, xìnpír  ‘envelope’  etc. And  a  few 
r-words are not nouns: shùnshŏur ‘easily; without problem’ (and wanr ‘have fun’.) 
 

One  historical  source  for  this  final  ‘r’  -  though  probably  not  the  only  one  -  is 
suggested  by  the writing  system which writes  it with  the  ér  of  érzi  ‘son.’  Supposedly,  ér 
was  originally  attached  to  nouns  in  certain  contexts  as  a  ‘diminutive,’  or  expression  of 
‘familiarity,’  but  with  time,  it  came  to  have  a  much  more  abstract  meaning,  ultimately 
ending  up  as  little more  than  a marker  of  nouns. As  noted  above,  very  few  verbs  appear 
with the r-ending.  
 
 
Some  words  -  particularly  those  with  single  syllables  -  have  forms  with  and  without  -r 
(and sometimes with tonal differences, as well) with distinct, though relatable meanings:

door 
 
empty   
unit 
 

ménr     
kòngr    
dānr 
  

way; knack 
empty space; spare time 
bedsheet; on one’s own 

mén 
 
kōng    
dān 
 
 
Southern  speakers  of  Mandarin,  who  often  regard  the  r-suffix  as  a  northern 
affectation, can - and do - avoid using it in all but those cases like èr ‘two’ where there is 
no choice: instead of yìdiănr ‘a bit’ they will say yìdiăn, instead of kòngr ‘free time’ they 
will say kòng, relying on only the tone (and context) to distinguish it from the level-toned 
kōng  ‘empty.’  In  reading,  they  will  usually  treat  the  r-suffix  as  a  separate  syllable,  -ér, 
reading mén-ér, for example, instead of ménr. But all the words cited above can be found 
with  the  r  pronunciation  indicated  in  dictionaries;  and  for  Beijing  and  other  northern 
speakers, the r-pronunciations are standard. 
 

Beijing  speakers,  on  the  other  hand  -  particularly  young  men  -  make  far  more 
extensive  use  of  the  r-flavoring  than  other  northern  speakers.  The  following  nursery 
rhyme, in which every last word has the r-suffix, illustrates. (This rhyme is found in Chen 
Zishi, compiler, Beiping Tongyao Xuanji, Taibei: Dà Zhongguo Guoshu Gongsi, 1969, p. 
94.)

Qióng tàitair 
 
 
 
Bàozhe ge jiānr, 
 
 
chīwán le fànr   
rào le ge wānr,  
 
 
yòu măi bīngláng yòu măi yānr. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Note 
Bīngláng  (derived  from  the  Indonesian/Malay  word  pinang)  is  the  areca  nut,  the  main 
ingredient  in  chewable  betel  quids  that  are  popular  in  Taiwan,  south  China,  and  in 
Southeast  Asia.  Chewing  betel  cleans  the  teeth,  helps  with  digestion,  and  provides  a 
pleasant  sensation  in  the  mouth  and  head.  It  also  makes  your  saliva  red  and  viscous  – 
something that leads to excess expectoration.  
 
a. Pronunciation 
You  will  have  observed  that  some  of  the  r-words  look  quite  unpronounceable, 
particularly  those  ending  in  ‘nr’  (yìdiănr,  yănr).  It  turns  out  they  are  not  pronounced  as 
written;  as  you  already  know,  yìdiănr  is  actually  pronounced  yìdiăr;  similarly,  píngr  is 
pronounced piér [pyuhr]. The pinyin convention  is  to leave  the syllables,  to which  the ‘r’ 
is added,  intact.  In  that way,  the original  syllable  can be  easily  identified,  and both  r  and 
r-less  versions  can  be  listed  together  in  a  dictionary.  This  practice  is  probably  also 
influenced  by  the  tendency  for  character  writing  to  preserve  syllables  and  ignore  sound 
changes. 
 

It  would  be  difficult  at  this  early  stage  of  our  study  to  present  all  possible  r-
syllables  in  the  way  that  we  have  done  for  other  rhymes.  Because  the  r-word  are  often 

 

142

regional,  colloquial  or  slangy,  relatively  few  are  encountered  in  beginning  textbooks. 
Here,  we  will  practice  only  a  selection.  The  following  examples  are  ordered  by  final 
consonant of the syllable; r seems to be especially compatible with roots ending in nasals 
in modern Mandarin - the last two columns: 
 

zìr  
cír  
shìr 
pír  
yìr  

[zèr]  huàr  gàir [gàr] 
wèir [wèr] 
[cér]  gēr 
[shèr]  xiàr 
kuàir [kuàr] 
huĭr [huěr] 
[piér] 
   
[yèr]      
 
 

 
bànr 
 
ménr 
 
diănr 
guăn [guăr] 
gùnr [guèr] 

píngr   [piénr] 
chóngr [chónr] 
kòngr   [kònr] 
yàngr   [yànr] 
huángr [huánr] 

 
Note  how  the  last  two  columns  are  pronounced. When  r  is  applied  to  an  n-final  syllable, 
the n  sound  is  lost completely: diăn > diăr; bàn > bàr. But when  the  r  is applied  to an ng 
final syllable,  the nasal endings survives as nasalization  (indicated by  the  superscript  -n), 
ie the vowels are pronounced nasally: kòngr > [kònr] etc. These rules are hard to apply, so 
for  now, we will  focus  on  r-word  that  are  frequently  encountered,  like  diănr,  yàngr,  huĭr 
and kuàir. 
 

F. reading practice 
Here  are  some  words  and  phrases  (many  of  them,  signs)  that  you  have  not  encountered 
before. Meanings are provided only to satisfy curiosity. With your developing knowledge 
of pinyin, you can try reading them aloud: 
 
 
hóngdēnglóng 

‘(red-lantern)’  Dàhóng  dēnglóng  gāogāo  guà  is  the  name  of  a 
fairly recent Chinese film, ‘Raise the Red Lantern.’

G. Written weather reports 
1. Weather reports in Chinese newspapers are usually limited to a brief description of the 
skies, the wind velocity and the high and low temperatures. The language is concise 
rather than colloquial, but otherwise fairly straightforward. Here are some examples, with 
glosses. The first is from a newspaper sold in Nanjing called Yángzi Wǎnbào (‘Yangtze 
Evening News’); the Arabic numbers are in the original. The second is taken, slightly 
edited, from the internet.  
 
(a) 
 

Yángzi Wǎnbào, 1999 nián, 7 yuè, 26 hào (unedited) 

Nánjīng shìqū tiānqì: jīntiān xiàwǔ dào yèli   duōyún, 
Nánjīng   city-region          afternoon to night many-clouds 

Internet, 1999 nián 10 yuè 25 rì (edited slightly)

 temp. 

míngtiān báitiān duōyún zhuǎnyīn

Běijīng:  duōyún        zhuǎnqíng,         piān xī fēng 3 jí, wēndù 20-24. 
 
   many-clouds becoming-clear towards west  wind  temp 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b) 
 
 
 
 
2. Below is a chart that shows the weather in the main Mainland (Dàlù) cities. From it, 
you can read off temperature, obviously, and with a little help from the glossary below, 
cloud and rain conditions. The temperatures, of course, you can characterize as lěng or rè 
etc. The other conditions (zhuǎnyín, duōyún etc.) will sound like what they are - weather 
report language; but in the context, that is acceptable.

Notes: 
*A large number of Mainland cities have zhōu as their second syllable: Sūzhōu, 
Hángzhōu, Xúzhōu, Lánzhōu, Fúzhōu, Chángzhōu, Yángzhōu, Guǎngzhōu, Gànzhōu etc. 
In old China, zhōu was an administrative unit, and the various cities that retain this 
syllable were once provincial centers. 
 
Phrases, with literal meanings: 
duōyún  
‘many clouds’  
‘turn overcast’ 
zhuǎn yīn  
‘turn clear’ 
zhuǎn qíng  
‘a shower of rain’ 
zhènyǔ  
yǔtiān   
‘rain day’ 
‘overcast day’ 
yīntiān  
qíngtiān

H. Rhymes 
 
1)  Here’s  a  bit  of  political  irony,  overheard  at  a  meeting  of  Chinese  teachers;  no  one 
wished to go on record, so it is cited anonymously.  
 

 

Néng hē yì jīn, hē bā liǎng: 
duìbùqǐ rénmín, 
 
 
duìbùqǐ dǎng.   

Néng hē bā liǎng, hē yì jīn: 
rénmín hé dǎng 
 
 
 
xīnliánxīn.  

 
 
 

 
 
 

Can drink 1 jin [but] drinks 8 ounces: 
apologies to the people, 
apologies to the party. 

Can drink 8 ozs. [but] drinks 1 jin: 
people and party, 
heart-linked-to heart. 

 
Notes: 
Jīn  is  a  Chinese  measure  equal  to  1/2  a  kilogram;  a  jīn  contains  16  liǎng  or  ‘ounces.’ 
Rénmín are ‘the people’ and dǎng is ‘the [communist] party.’ Xīn is ‘heart; feelings.’ 
 
2) And another nursery rhyme about insects: 
 

Chóng, chóng chóng, chóng 
 
insects… fly 
fly-to South Mountain to+drink dew 
dew drink-full LE 
turn-head then run LE 

 
 
 
 

Chóng, chóng chóng, chóng fēi, 
 
fēidào Nánshān hē lùshǔi, 
 
 
lùshǔi hēbǎo le 
huítóu jiù pǎo le!
