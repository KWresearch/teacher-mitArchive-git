The first two weeks of the course are referred to as "Transition." During these
weeks the students review what they learned in 21F.102. Below is detailed
information about what is covered during Transition.
Also see the daily_homework assigned for the course.
***** Transition *****
In order to effect a smooth transition from first to second year, and from one
type of materials to another, excerpts from the beginning course (complete with
exercises) will be made available on the Stellar site for review and
elaboration. Although it covers (mostly) familiar territory (words, grammar,
usage), and even though it is labeled with what sound like very early lesson
numbers (as low as 3, in fact) the material which you will be working with is
almost all novel (beginning with the dialogues) - even for students who took
101/102 last year. You can of course, skim right through the lessons (and do a
complete review of each with flashcube), but you are only being asked to focus
on the following parts.
Notes:
These lessons are numbered consecutively, so that each page is unique.
FlashCube allows dialogue material to be downloaded separately.
Exercises are for your own use â do them and note difficulties.
In the lists below, sections skipped are intentionally skipped (because we
judge them to be already familiar to you â but you may want to skim them to
be sure).
