A.  Transition 

1. Adverbs reviewed: 
Translate the following sentences into good English – noting the adjustments that are 
necessary; then try back-translating from English into Chinese. 
Zǒngcái bù yídìng hěn yǒu qián, kěshì yídìng hěn máng. 
Fùzǒngtǒng bù yídìng hěn yǒumíng, dànshì fùzǒngtǒng yídìng hen lei. 
Wǒmen yígòng zhǐ yǒu sān kuài qián – sān kuài bú gòu! 
Tā hěn máng; wǒ yě hěn máng, shì yīnwèi kǎoshì hěn duō. 
Zhēn lèi, zuótiān yǒu kǎoshì, jīntiān yǒu bàogào! 
Nǐ bú lèi, wǒ yě bú lèi, zánmen qù kàn péngyou, hǎo bù hǎo? 
Zhōngwén hěn nán, dànshì lǎoshī dōu bù yán 
     
Wǒmen dōu hěn è, hái méi chī fàn ne!   
 
Wǒ wèn tāmen è bú è. / Tāmen zěnme shuō? / Shuō dōu bú è. 
 
 
Wǒmen bù dōu hěn è: tāmen hái méi chīfàn; kěshì wǒ ne, wǒ yǐjīng (‘already’) chī le! 
 
Exercise: Provide rough equivalents in Chinese for the following: 
1. I’m really tired!   
 
2. We’re tired too.   
4. But none of us is nervous. 
 
3. We’re all tired. 
 
5. I’m still hungry.   
 
6. I’m tired and nervous. 
8. Cool.! 
 
 
7. He’s so cute.

10. I’m cold. 
12. I have exams today, and tomorrow too.   

9. What fun! 
 
 
11. Me too. [cold] 
 
 
13. I’ve read it and so has Mínmǐn. 
14. We have exams on Monday and Thursday. 
15. Not of all them are students; Zhāng Yīng is a teacher and so is Wáng Lìlì. 
 
2. Year, in dates, versus year of age 
a) Dates 
Years  in  dates  are  usually  expressed  as  strings  of  single  digits  (rather  than  large  numbers) 
placed before nián ‘year.’ The only exception is the millennium year, such as 2000, which is 
sometimes expressed as ‘two thousand’: 
2002 
èr líng líng èr nián 
yī jiǔ jiǔ bā nián 
1998 
1946 
yī jiǔ sì liù nián 
yī bā sì líng nián 
1840 
2000 
èr líng líng líng nián   
 

or 

liǎngqiān nián ‘2 thousand year ’ 

The question word used to elicit a year as a date is něinián ‘which year.’ [Něi is the 
combining  form  of  nǎ  ‘which,’  also  related  to  nǎr  ‘where.’]  Learning  this  phrase  makes  it 
tempting to ask questions about the year of certain events. But to do so, one encounters some 
grammatical complications, which will be discussed later in this lesson, after the dialogue.   
 
b) Age 
While  in  English  age  as  well  as  duration  are  both  given  in  ‘years,’  Chinese  makes  a 
distinction. Years of duration are counted with nián (originally ‘a harvest’ or ‘harvest year ’): 
sān  nián  ‘3  years’;  sānshí  nián  ’30  years.’  But  age  is  counted  with  the  measure  word  suì 
(originally used  for  the planet  ‘Jupiter ’  and a  cycle of 12 years –  its  revolutionary period – 
and later the cycle of seasons). Thus: shíbā suì ’18 years old,’ èrshíyī suì ’21 years old,’ jiǔ suì 
‘9 years old.’

How old is he (by now)? 
He’s only 8. 

Excuse me, how old are you (by now)? 
I’m 28. 

Because  age  is  crucial  to  status  in  China,  age  is  questioned  more  readily  that  in 
English speaking countries. Of the several ways of asking the question, the most neutral uses 
the phrase duō dà ‘(to+what+degree be+big) how old,’ often with a final le (‘change of state,’ 
suggesting ‘so far.’) If a verb is present to link the subject with duō dà, it is usually yǒu, not 
shì. Here are some examples: 
 
Qǐng wèn, nín duō dà <le>? 
Wǒ èrshíbā suì <le>. 
 
Tā duō dà <le>? 
 
Tā zhǐ yǒu bā suì <le>. 
 
Zhǐ, as adverb, requires a following verb, and the one used for age is yǒu (not shì).   
 
c) Year in school or college 
‘Year ’  or  ‘class’  in  school  or  college  is  niánjí,  a  compound  consisting  of  nián  ‘year ’  and  jí 
‘level’: yìniánjí ‘first year (‘freshman’), èrniánjí ‘second year (sophomore)’ etc. The question 
is formed with the low toned jǐ ‘how many; how much’; hence, jǐniánjí ‘what year.’ 
 
Qǐng wèn, nǐ shì jǐniánjí de <xuéshēng>? 
(…‘how+many levels DE student?) 
 
Wǒ shì sìniánjí de <xuéshēng>. 
 
Wǒ shì Qīng Huá sānniánjí de xuéshēng. 
 
 
Wǒ bú shì xuéshēng. 
 
 
Wǒ shì yánjiūshēng. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

I’m a fourth year student. 
I’m a 3rd year student at Qing Hua. 
I’m not a student. 
I’m a graduate student (‘postgraduate’). 
(‘research student’) 

May I ask your year in school, please?

Notice  that  cóng-dào  phrases  are  ‘time  when’  and  -  unlike  English  equivalents  –  they  are 
placed before their verb. 
 
5. Alternatives to the construction qù + place 
We have seen that destination can be expressed directly after the verb qù (or lái): qù Běijīng, 
lái Měiguó. This pattern  is probably  a  southern  feature of Mandarin,  since  it  is  common  to 
southern  regional  languages  such  as  Cantonese  and  Hokkien,  and  contrasts  with  another

92

   

pattern  commonly  used  in  Mandarin,  one  that  involves  the  prepositional  dào  ‘to,’  just 
introduced in the last section (and a final qu that is often toneless): 
Nǐ dào nǎr qu? 
> 
Nǐ qù nǎr? 
 
Wǒ qù Běijīng. 
> 
Wǒ dào Běijīng qu. 
 
Though stylistic factors may favor one pattern over the other in some contexts, for 
the most  part  the  two  seem  to  be  synonymous. The  following  examples  introduce  the  verb 
xiăng ‘think; think of; intend to; plan to; want to’ and the noun sùshè ‘dormitory’: 
 
 
 
Qĭng wèn: 
 
 
Nĭ xiànzài qù năr?   /    Wŏ qù sùshè. 
> 
Nĭ xiànzài dào năr qu?    / Wŏ dào sùshè qu. 
  . 
 
Jīntiān, wŏ bù xiăng qù túshūguăn, wŏ xiăng qù chéng lĭ kàn péngyou.        > 
Jīntiān, wŏ bù xiăng dào túshūguăn qu, wŏ xiăng dào chéng lĭ qu kàn péngyou.   

 
 
 

 

 
And some examples with the indefinite use of nǎr or nǎlǐ:     
Nǐ qù nǎr?    /    Wǒ bú qù nǎr!   
> 
Nǐ dào nǎr qu?    /    Wǒ bú dào nǎr qu.   

 

There is, in fact, an alternative to the prepositional form with dào that uses shàng 
‘ascend; on,’    but shàng in this context seems to carry with it a special nuance of    ‘setting 
off for someplace,’ and so is much more common in the question than in the answer: 
 
Nǐ qù nǎr? 
Where are you going? 
Nǐ dào nǎr qu?  Where are you going? 
Nǐ shàng nǎr qu?  Where are you off to? 

Wǒ qù túshūguǎn. 
Wǒ dào túshūguǎn qu. 
Wǒ shàng túshūguǎn qu. 

 
 
 

 

93

6. Follow up Qs, with final qu (often toneless):    Are you going there to [    ]? 
Hǎo, nà wǒ zǒu le, wǒ gāi qù túshūguǎn: 
[You] going [there] to do homework? 
Zuò gōngkè qu ma?  
Kàn bào qu ma? 
 
[You] going [there] to read the paper? 
Míngtiān děi qù Běijīng: 
Kāihuì qu ma? 
 
Kàn péngyou qu ma? 
Hǎo, wǒ xiànzài děi qù chéng lǐ: 
Qǔ yīfu qu ma? 
 
Mǎi dōngxi qu ma?  
Chīfàn qu ma?

C. Analysis 

 

you be which-country person 

a) Nĭ shì nĕiguó rén? 
    (Nĭ shì năguó rén?) 
b) Nĭ shì năr de rén? 
 
c) Nĭ shì shénme dìfang rén?   
d) Nĭ shì shénme dìfang lái de? 

1. Nationality 
 
There are several ways of asking about nationality; you should try to be familiar with them 
all. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the first (a), nĕiguó is preferred by teachers, but năguó is often heard. Options (b-d) do 
not, strictly speaking, ask about nationality, but about place, and can be answered with a city 
or town, as well as a country name. In fact (c) is often the follow up question to (a). The 
responses to these questions usually take the same form as the question, ie: 

you be where DE person 
you be what place person 
you be what place come one 

 

97

 
 
 
 

A. Nĭ shì shénme dìfang lái de? 
 
B. Wŏ shì Rìbĕn lái de. 

Where are you from? 
I’m from Japan. 

Some country names – mostly those with a history of independence and political 
power – are composed of a single syllable plus guó ‘country; nation,’ on the model of 
Zhōngguó ‘China (middle-country).’ For these countries the first syllable is chosen for its 
sound as well as meaning: Měiguó ‘(beautiful-country) the USA’; Yīngguó ‘(hero-country) 
England; Britain’; Fǎguó ‘(law-country) France’; Déguó ‘(virtue-country) Germany’; Tàiguó 
‘(peace-country) Thailand.’ Countries with close historical ties to China have often retained 
their old names. Nippon, a name that is cognate with the English name Japan, is the source of 
the Chinese name, Rìběn, literally ‘sun-root,’ ie from the Chinese perspective, ‘the rising 
sun.’ Miǎndiàn is an old Chinese name for Burma; the new name for that country, Myanmar, 
reveals the connection more clearly. Most other countries are simply transliterated: Jiānádà, 
Yìdàlì, Fèilǜbīn, Yìndù, Bāxī. City names, except for those in Japan and Korea, are almost all 
transliterated: Zhījiāgē, Bèi’érfǎsītè, Tèlāwéifū. A few are translated rather than 
transliterated, eg Salt Lake City, Yánhúchéng ‘salt-lake-city,’ and the two mentioned in an 
earlier lesson, Cambridge, Jiànqiáo and Oxford Niújīn. The appendix to this lesson provides 
an extensive list of country and city names. 
 
2. Xiàng versus xiǎng 
Xiàng, with falling tone, is a SV with the meaning of ‘be like; resemble’; it often occurs with 
yíyàng ‘the same’ (cf. zěnmeyàng, zhèiyàngr). Examples: 
Tā xiàng Zhōngguó rén <yíyàng>. 
She looks Chinese! 
He looks like his father. 
Tā hěn xiàng tā bàba. 
 
He’s like a bird, [he] can fly. 
Tā xiàng niǎo <yíyàng>, néng fēi! 
Tā hěn gāo, xiàng ge jùrén! 
 
He’s tall, like a giant! 

 
Xiǎng, with low tone, is quite a different word. Its core meaning is ‘think’, which is extended 
to the meaning of ‘think of ’ or ‘miss’:   

 

98

 
 

 
 

 
 

[I] miss you. 
You must miss China. 

Wǒ hěn xiǎng nǐ.     
Nǐ hěn xiǎng Zhōngguó ba! 
 
But more commonly still, xiǎng has the meaning of ‘intend to; feel like; want to’: 
 
Wǒ hěn xiǎng qù Zhōngguó.   
Nǐ xiǎng dào nǎli qù? 
 
 
3. The position of zài phrases 
In previous lessons, we have encountered phrases in which zài is a main verb: xíngli zài zhèr; 
as well as those in which the zài phrase appears before an associated verb: zài fēijī shàng chī 
fàn ‘to eat on the airplane.’ In lesson 3, it was noted that some verbs (shēng and zhù, for 
example) allow zài phrases to occur directly after them: shēng zài Běijīng ‘be born in 
Běijīng’; zhù zài Xī’ān ‘live in Xi’an.’As we will see below, on certain occasions, zài phrases 
may also occur before these same verbs. What determines these shifting positions? 
 

I want to go to China. 
Where are you thinking of going? 

In some cases, the difference in the two positions - before a verb versus after a verb 
– can be seen to reflect the notional difference between ‘location’ and ‘goal.’ Thus, with the 
verb fàng ‘put,’ which involves the movement of something from one place to another (‘a 
goal’), the zài phrase generally follows: fàng zài zhèr ‘put it here.’ While with chī ‘eat,’ on the 
other hand, an activity that takes place in a certain setting (‘a location’), the zài phrase 
generally precedes the verb: zài fànguǎnr chī fàn ‘to eat in a restaurant.’ So far so good. But 
what about verbs like zhù that, as we noted in the previous paragraph, allow both positions? 
 
 
 
 
Presumably with such verbs, the notion of location and goal get conflated. ‘Live’ can be seen 
as the action of ‘settling down in a place’ in which case the zài phrase is a goal, or it can be 
thought of as a state or situation, in which case the zài phase is a location. Rather than trying 

Wǒ zhù zài Táinán.  
Wǒ zài Táinán zhù.  

I live in Tainan. 
I live in Tainan. 

 

99

to see the logic, it is better to begin by remembering that the three common verbs zhù ‘live; 
stay’, shēng ‘be born’, and – we add here - zhǎng or zhǎngdà ‘grow up’ - all allow both 
positions, and then learn to distinguish the options from particular examples in the dialogues 
(or in later lessons, narratives).   
 
4. The shì… de pattern – first encounter: 
a) Něinián, shénme shíhou, with non-past events 
Earlier in this lesson, in the second section of the Transitions (A-2a), we noted that the year 
could be questioned with něinián ‘which year,’ but grammatical complications kept us from 
pursuing the topic further in the transitions section. Now, having had a chance to examine the 
dialogue, we return to it. Time-when phrases (unlike the location phrases of the previous 
section) are consistently placed before their associated verb in Chinese – we have seen 
examples such as: Wǒ míngtiān qù chéng lǐ kàn péngyou. And with a future (or unrealized) 
event, a question with něinián follows the same pattern: Qǐng wèn, nǐ něinián qù Běijīng? 
 

A more general expression than něinián is shénme shíhou ‘what time; when’:   
 
Q. Qǐng wèn, nǐ shénme shíhou qù Běijīng?   
A. Xīngqīliù qù. 
 
 
 
 
Q. Nǐ shénme shíhou dào chéng lǐ qu?   
A. Xiànzài bú qù le, hái děi xuéxí! 
 

May I ask when you’re going to Beijing? 
I’m going on Saturday. 

When are you going into town? 
I’m not going after all, I still have to 
study! 

b) Past events 
So much for unrealized events – those planned for, or just happening, in the future. But for 
events that have happened – those in the past – the presence of time phrases often has 
interesting grammatical consequences. When the associated verb is present (rather than 
omitted through ellipsis), a mysterious de – the familiar particle used in an unfamiliar way – 
may appear after the verb (after the object in some cases, but in front of it in others). And at 
the other end of the sentence, the time phrase may be introduced by shì ‘be’: 

 

100

Nǐ <shì> něinián lái de? 
Wǒ <shì> qùnián lái de. 
Qùnián. 
 
 

When was it you came? 
I came last year. 
Last year. (elliptical answer) 

 
 
 
 
 
This is the so-called shì…de construction. For now, we can simply note that it is found only 
with past events, and that it has the effect of highlighting the circumstances of the verbal 
event (the time and the place, for example). In this respect, it is similar in function (and to a 
degree, in form) to the so-called cleft construction of English, which also spotlights the 
circumstances (time, place etc.) by using the verb ‘be’ and the notional equivalent of de, 
‘that.’ The English constuction, however, is optional; the Chinese – at least in this case    – is 
required. 
 
 
 

It was in 1946 - that I was born. 
Wǒ shì 1946 nián - shēng de. 

I was born in 1946.  
              0   
 

> 
 

Practicing the example sentences in this section and in the dialogue will help us to 
get used to the rhythm of this pattern; in later lessons, we fill in the details and place it in a 
larger grammatical context. Here are some examples involving time:

c) Highlighting place 
Now let us turn to ‘place,’ and our three verbs shēng, zhù and zhǎng<dà>. In lesson 3, the first 
two appeared in the context of reporting on biographical information (one’s own, or other ’s) 
- rather than recounting a string of events in a story. This is a typical context for the zài phrase 
to appear after the verb. Thus a statement like the following is common and should – with 
one’s own data – be memorized.   
Wǒ shēng zai Tiānjīn<g>, 
 
zhǎng zai Běijīng, 
 
 
 
xiànzài zhù zai Bōshìdùn.   
 
However, in another context, such as that of a follow up question to the response ‘wǒ shì 
1946 nián shēng de’, the location phrase will be placed before the verb, and when in that 
position, it has to be cast in the shi…de pattern: 
Q 
Nǐ shì shénme dìfang shēng de? 
Wǒ shì zài Sūzhōu shēng de,   
A 
 
zài Sūzhōu zhǎng<dà> de, 
 
 
 
xiànzài yě zài Sūzhōu zhù. 
 
Note that (in all cases) the shi…de pattern (a) requires the time or place to appear before the 
verb (so does not appear with shēng zài Sūzhōu) (b) is appropriate only for events that have 
already occurred (so not in xiànzài yě zài Sūzhōu zhù), and (c) the shì, may be omitted, but 
the de is required (as in the second clause of shì zài Sūzhōu shēng de, zài Sūzhōu zhǎngdà 
de). 
 
Exercise. Provide a Chinese translation for the following conversation: 
“Hello. I’m a student at MIT. My parents were born in Canton City, but I was born in the US, 
in Chicago. I grew up in Chicago, but now, of course, I live in Boston. I have an older sister. 

Where was it that you were born? 
I was born in Suzhou. 
grew up in Sūzhōu, 
and I live in Sūzhōu now. 

 

102

Nǐ qù guo Zhōngguó ma? 
Have you been to China? 
Nǐ qù guo Zhōngguó méi<you>? 

She was also born in Canton.” 
“When did your parents come to the US?” 
“They came in 1982.” 
“Do they still live in Chicago?” 
“Yes, they do. But they’re coming to see me on Saturday.” 
 
5. VERB+guo 
Commonly, people will ask if you have ever been to a particular place, or ever done some 
particular thing –regardless of precisedly when. This meaning is achieved by placing guo 
(untoned in northern speech), whose root meaning is ‘pass; cross over,’ after the verb. Like le, 
guo is associated with yǒu/méiyou, but with a difference: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are parallels to patterns associated with the le: 
Nǐ chīfàn le ma? 
Q. 
 
Have you eaten? 
 
Nǐ chīfàn le méi<you>? 
 
A. 
 
 
 
Both constructions make use of the verb méi<you> in the negative, as well as in the V-not-V 
question. However, note the differences: while le itself only appears in the positive, guo 
remains in both positive and negative! 

 
 
Chī le. 
Méi<you> chī ne. 
 
Hái méi<you> chī ne. 

Wǒ qù guo. 
 
Wǒ méi<you> qù guo. 
Wǒ hái méi<you> qù guo. 

I’ve been there. 
I haven’t [ever] been [there] 
I still haven’t [ever] been [there]. 

I have. 
I haven’t.   
Not yet.   

 

103

Nǐ chī guo Zhōngguó fàn ma? 
Méi chī guo, hěn xiǎng chī. 
 

Have you ever eaten Chinese food? 
No I haven’t [but] I really want to. 

Nǐ zuò guo fēijī ma? 
Dāngrán zuò guo. 
 

Have you ever flown on an airplane? 
Of course I have.

6. Ellipsis of the second syllable of disyllabic verbs. 
As  we  have  seen,  two  syllable  SVs  such  as  jǐnzhāng  or  hǎochī  frequently  appear  in  the 
following pattern: 

Have you ever eaten hǎishēn? 
(‘seaslug, aka sea cucumber ’)  
Not yet, but I’d love to try some. 
Have you eaten yet? 
Not yet. 
Okay, let’s go and eat, we can have 
some seaslug. 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Jǐn bù jǐnzhāng? 
Hǎo bù hǎochī? 
Hǎo bù hǎokàn? 
Shū bù shūfu? 
 

 

104

This is also true of disyllabic non-stative verbs, such as kěyǐ, xǐhuān (‘like’): 
Kě bù kěyǐ? 
Xǐ bù xǐhuān? 
 
SVs that incorporate yǒu, form V-not-V questions with yǒu méiyǒu: 
Is [it] interesting? 
Yǒu méiyou yìsi? 
 
Yǒu méiyou yòng?   
Is [it] useful? 

 
b) Most of the verb-not-verb questions you have seen so far do not involve objects, eg Lèi bú 
lèi? But when an object  is  involved,  the negated verb may sometimes appear,  lightly  toned,   
after it: 

Shì bu shi xuéshēng? 
 
Yǒu méiyou yìsi? 

> 
> 

Shì xuéshēng bu shi? 
Yǒu yìsi méiyou? 

 
 
This pattern recalls the normal order for V-not-V versions of V+le or V+guo sentences: 
Chīfàn <le> méiyou? 
Chīfàn le ma?   
 
>   
Nǐ qù guo Zhōngguó ma?    >   
Nǐ qù guo Zhōngguó méiyou? 

 
Exercise. Write out the alternate form for the following (and, of course, be able to translate): 
1. Tā shì Měiguó rén ma? 
2. Ruǎnjiàn (software) yǒuyòng ma? 
3. Nǐ chī guo hǎishēn ma? 
4. Nǐ yào qù Cháng Chéng ma? 
5. Nǐ chīfàn le ma? 
 
7. Shàng and xià 
Shàng and xià are opposites, meaning ‘upper; go up, get on’ and ‘lower; go down, get off ’ 
respectively. Here are some typical examples: 
shàng chē ‘board a vehicle’ 
 
 
shàng kè ‘attend class’ 

xià chē ‘get off a vehicle’ 
xià kè ‘get out of class’ 

 

105

xià ge xīngqī ‘next week’ 
xià ge yuè ‘next month’ 

shàng bān ‘go to work’ 
(‘go+on shift’)

(but qùnián ‘last year’ 
and zuótiān ‘yesterday’ 
 
lóushàng ‘upstairs’   
 
Note: lóu ‘building’; shísìhào lóu ‘building #14’; dàlóu ‘multi-storied building’ 
 
8. Wánr 
Colloquial speech in Beijing and other parts of the northeast is notable for the presence of r- 
syllables, characterized by a final ‘r’ whose influence spreads though out the syllable. Certain 
of these r-syllables may be present in standard Mandarin, but Mandarin speakers from 
Taiwan and regions outside the northeast often avoid them. In order to provide a 
representation of r- and r-less speech, the pinyin convention is to take the r-less syllable as 
basic, and then add ‘r’ to indicate the possibility of the ‘r ’ option. Native speakers know how 
‘r ’ affects a syllable. Learners will have to internalize such rules more slowly. Wánr for 
example, can be written wán and be pronounced [wáhn] or it can be written wánr, in which 
case it is pronounced, roughly, [wáhr] – with no ‘n’ sound at all. Wánr symbolizes both 
possibilities.   
 

Wánr is interesting not only for it pronunciation, but also for its meaning. In 
dictionaries, it is glossed ‘play; have fun’ but in many cases an appropriate translation is 
difficult to find. In the Chinese world, wánr is the counterpart of ‘work’ (gōngzuò) – and 
notice that in English we do sometimes place ‘work and play’ in opposition. Here are some 
sample sentences: 

 

106

Yǒu kòng qǐng zài lái wánr.  If you have some time, come by again. 
(zài = ‘again’) 
 
(Have spare+time please again come play.) 
Nèi ge dìfang hěn hǎo wánr.  That place is very interesting. 
 
 
 
(That GE place very good play.) 
MIT xuéshēng hěn xǐhuān    MIT students love to fool around with   
wánr diànnǎo.   
 
computers. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note the last example, in which wánr is used not as a SV, but as a transitive verb; cf. máng ‘be 
busy’ and máng shénme ‘be busy at what.’

Notes 
Sūzhōu  An ancient city, west of Shanghai, close to Lake Tai (Tài Hú), known for its canals 
and stone bridges. Until the growth of Shanghai in modern times, Suzhou was an 
important cultural and administrative center of the region. Its earlier wealth is 
reflected in the great houses and gardens that belonged to merchants and officials; 
one of the best known has the quaint name of ‘The Humble Administrator ’s 
Garden’ (Zhuō Zhèng Yuán). Much of the old city has been obliterated in recent 
years by industrial growth and extensive building. Hángzhōu, mentioned in the 
saying that closes the dialogue, is another historically important city, southwest of 
Shanghai.

nĕi wèi is more polite that shéi ~ shuí. 
‘really good’ suggests more amazement than, say, hĕn hăo. A more 
colloquial alternative answer, especially popular in Taiwan, would be

E Pinyin and sounds 

1. The rhymes 
(a) Possible rhymes 
The  spoken  syllable,  or  rather,  its  pinyin  representation,  can  be  divided  into  an  initial   
consonant and a rhyme, the latter composed of a medial, a vowel, a final and a tone (eg –iào, 
uang.) You are already familiar with the inventory of initials, represented by the six-line chart 
beginning bo po mo fo. Now we look more closely at the rhymes. Here are some possibilities: 
 
 
 
 
Vowel+Tone: 
 
 
Medial + Vowel+Tone: 
Vowel + Ending+Tone 
 
 
Medial + Vowel + Ending+Tone:   
 
 
The most minimal written rhymes consist of only a vowel and a tone; one of a small number 
of medial sounds can precede the vowel, and one of an equally limited number of endings can 
follow. The vowels consist of a, e, i, o, u or ü. Medials are limited to i, u or ü, and endings to 
n,  ng,  i,  and  o.  (But  –  note  this  -  the  combination  oo  –  consisting  of  the  vowel  o  and  the 
ending o, is written ou rather than oo: dou; zhou etc.) 
 

tā, bǐ, kè, è, shū 
xiè, zuò, duì, xué, jiù, nué 
hěn, máng, hǎo, lèi, dōu 
jiàn, jiǎng, jiāo 

 

111

Exercise. Where to write the tone mark: 
It is useful to be able to place the tone mark correctly in those pinyin syllables that have more 
than one vowel letter, eg lèi, lǎo or jiào. To do this properly, you need to distinguish the vowel 
proper, V, from the medial (M) and the final (F) letters. The tone mark is placed over the V.     
 

To determine the V, you need to be able to rule out M and F.    There are only three 
possible M: i, u (the latter, pronounced u or ü) and the rare ü. If one of those is present before 
another vowel letter, it is an M, eg xiè, zhuō, xué, and the following vowel is the V. 
 

tie ( 1 ) 

 

guo ( 2 )       

hai ( 2 ) 

      xue ( 2 )           

There are four possible F: i, o, n and ng; ‘o+o’, you recall, is written ou, so in that 
one case, u is also a final. If there are two vowel letters (and you have ruled out any M), the 
latter will be a F, and the previous letter with be the V: dōu, lèi, hǎo, jiāo. 
 
Now  try  identifying  the  vowels  (V)  of  the  following  syllables--  and  add  the  indicated  tone 
mark accordingly: 
 
jiao ( 1 )              zuo ( 4 ) 
 
dou ( 1 )              jiu ( 3 ) 
 
b) A note on words beginning with y- or w-: 
Though syllables may begin with the vowels a, o, e (eg è, ān, ōu etc.), they do not begin with 
i or u. Where medial i and u might occur at the beginning of a syllable, they are written y and 
w, respectively. You might think of such cases as follows: 
 
 
 
* 
 

duo, shuo, drop the Ci:   
xie, bie, drop the Ci:   
xue, jue, drop the Ci 
 
 

qian ( 2 )        guo ( 2 )           

> wo 
> ye 
>yue   

bao ( 4 )     

gui ( 4 ) 

uo   
ie     
ue 

[Note the ü sound]

[ü]

[üe] 

you 
wei 
wen 

 
> 
> 
> 
> 
>

However, if i, u, ü are themselves vowels (as in nǐ, shū, nǚ), then dropping the Ci 
would  leave only  the vowels  i, u, and ü, and  if  these were simply rewritten as y and w, you 
would end up with rather curious looking syllables like ‘w’ (shu, drop the Ci to get u > w) or 
‘wn’ (shun > un > wn); or ‘y’ and ‘yng.’    So in such cases, instead of upgrading i and u to y 
and w as before, y and w are added to them: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ji, drop the j: 
 
i 
in 
 
jin, drop the j: 
 
 
jing, drop the j: 
 
ing 
u 
 
shu, drop the sh: 
 
u 
 
xu, drop the x: 
 
 
jun, drop the j: 
 
un 
 
ue 
 
xue, drop the x: 
 
There are a few exceptions to the neat pattern: 
 
 
 
 
iu > 
>> 
jiu, drop the j: 
ui > 
gui, drop the g: 
>> 
zhun, drop the zh:  un > 
>> 
 
c) The rhyme table 
A complete table of rhymes is given below. It is too long and complicated to be immediately 
internalized  like your chart of  initials, but you can practice reading  the rows aloud with  the 
help  of  a  teacher  or  native  speaker. You  should  return  to  this  chart  frequently,  and  practice 
reading  out  all  the  rhymes.  You  can  also  map  your  progress  through  the  chart  by  circling 
syllables, or adding examples  to  the  lines, as you  learn new vocabulary. The  table below  is 
organized by main vowel,  and  then  subcategorized by medial  and  final. Asterisks  (*) mark 
sets that need your special attention.

Notice that while the sound [ü] occurs after the initials of row 5 (j, q, x), it does not need to be 
marked as such since only the sound [ü] is possible after those intials. Thus we write ju, qu, 
and xu (not jü, qü, and xü). However, with initials n and l, both [ü] and [u] (‘yu’ and ‘oo’) are 
possible so each must be indicated. So nü and nu, lü and lu.

Notes on country and city names: 
Korea. The PRC calls (North) Korea Cháoxiǎn, while Taiwan and overseas communities call 
(South) Korea Hánguó. Cháoxiǎn is a Chinese version of what is usually rendered Choson in 
English, the name of the dynasty that came to an end in 1910. Hán (distinct from falling toned 
Hàn  of  Hànrén  ‘Chinese’)  is  also  a  traditional  name,  historically  applied  to  ‘states’  on  the 
south and western parts of the Korean peninsula. In the past, the name Gāolì was also applied, 
based on the same root that gave us the name Korea; cf. the Koryo dynasty. 
 
San  Francisco.  The  Cantonese  name,  pronounced  Sānfānshì  (shì  ‘city’)  in  Mandarin,  is 
obviously a transliteration of the English. The name commonly used in Mandarin, Jiùjīnshān 
means literally ‘old gold mountain,’ a reference to Gold Rush days, when numerous Chinese 
migrated to California from the coast of Canton province.

Huáshèngdùn. Also referred to in the US Chinese newspapers as Huáfǔ ‘national capital.’ 
 
Paris and Bali: If Paris is Bālí, you may wonder what the Chinese name for the island of Bali 
[Indonesia]  is.  It’s  also  Bālí.  The  distinction  is  made  by  adding  dăo  ‘island’  to  the  latter: 
Bālídăo. Cf. Hǎinándǎo ‘Hainan Island’ (off the southern coast of China). 
 
Philadelphia. Fèichéng. Chéng  is  ‘city’  (originally  ‘wall,’  a  feature  characteristic of  cities).   
Fèi is a rendering of the first syllable of Philadelphia; cf Africa, Fēizhōu (a different fei, cf. 
Nánfēi ‘South Africa’). 
   
Tokyo.  Dōngjīng,  literally  ‘eastern  capital.’  Cf.  Bĕijīng  ‘northern  capital,’  and  Nánjīng 
‘southern capital.’ There is no Xījīng. 
 
Russia.  Éluósī  or  Éguó  on  the Mainland,  but  often  Èguó  in  Taiwan.  The USSR was  called 
Sūlián - Sū from Sūwēi’āi ‘Soviet’ + lián meaning ‘unite.’ 
 
Canton,  Chungking,  Nanking,  Peking  etc.  English  spellings  of  Chinese  names  are  not  as 
irrational as they may at first seem. In an earlier transcription system, ‘ki’ was regularly used 
for what pinyin represents as ‘ji.’ In other transcriptions, the distinction between (pinyin) b, d, 
g  and  p,  t,  k  etc.  was  represented  as  p,  t,  k  and  p’,  t’,  k’  etc.  In  common  practice,  the 
apostrophes were omitted, hence Peking, Taipei, the Tao Te Ching (the Taoist classic) rather 
than pinyin Beijing, Taibei, Dao De Jing (the Daoist classic). The name ‘Canton’ is based on 
the name of the province, Guǎngdōng, rather than the city, Guǎngzhōu.

G. Rhymes 
 

a) A tale of betrayal and heartbreak: 
Tiào shéng 
 
 
Skipping rope 
Jiāngjiě, Jiāngjiě, hǎo Jiāngjiě,   
Sister Jiang, good Sister Jiang, 
nǐ shì rénmín de hǎo Jiāngjiě.  
You are the people’s good Sister Jiang; 
Pàntú, pàntú, Fǔ Zhìgāo, 
 
Traitor, traitor, Fu Zhigao 
Nǐ shì rénmín de ‘dà cǎobāo’.                  You are the people’s ‘great straw- 
   
 
 
 
bundle’ (‘good-for-nothing’). 
 
As  I  was  told  it,  Fǔ  Zhìgāo,  a  young  man,  and  Jiāng,  a  young  woman,  served  the  people 
together, but Fǔ Zhìgāo betrayed her to the Guómíndǎng (Kuomintang, KMT), who had her 
executed; later Fǔ Zhìgāo was caught by the Communists (Gōngchǎndǎng, CCP) and put to 
death. Not a happy story, but a salubrious one.   
 
b) Now something a little lighter, another nursery rhyme: 
  
moon goes, I also go 
Yuèliang zǒu, wǒ yě zǒu, 
 
I and moon make friends 
wǒ hé yuèliang jiāo péngyou,  
pocket in filled+with 2 item eggs 
dài lǐ zhuāngzhe liǎng zhī dàn, 
to present to moon as breakfast. 
song gěi yuèliang dāng zǎofàn. 
ǐ Yǒngyàn (Nanjing)
