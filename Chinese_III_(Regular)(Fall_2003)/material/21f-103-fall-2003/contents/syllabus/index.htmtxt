***** Course Description *****
This course is designed to consolidate the foundation built in Elementary
Chinese and continue developing students' skills in aural comprehension,
reading, and writing. Lab work required. Intermediate I and II form a sequence.
The Fall semester subject 21F103 is prerequisite for the Spring. Students who
have completed the streamlined sequence 21F107-108 are not normally eligible
for this subject.
Upon completion of the course, students should be able to speak Chinese with
some fluency on basic conversational topics, achieve a basic level of reading
competence within simplified and traditional characters learned plus common
compounds, and be able to write short compositions.
Classes consist of a combination of lecture, drill practice, discussion,
reading comprehension practice, listening comprehension practice, situational
dialogue practice.

89-86=B+
85-83=B
82-80=B-
79-76=C+
75-73=C
72-70=C-
60-69=D

Factors involved in the class grade include being on time and prepared,
completing written assignments carefully and on time, and participating
enthusiastically in class activities. Other factors may come in to play, e.g.:
improvement versus deterioration over the course of the semester, and progress
relative to starting level.
    * No make-up quizzes unless you have permission from the lecturer
      beforehand. If you are sick or unable to make to the class due to
      unexpected situation, you should contact the lecturer.
    * Homework or portfolios handed in late will be corrected but receive no
      credit.
    * Attendance in this class is extremely important. If you were absence
      without any permission from your lecturer, then your final grade would be
      affected.
    * You have to prepare a folder for collecting all of your written work
      which includes revisions of all your written homework assignments and
      quizzes. Turn in your portfolio once every two weeks.
***** Advice on Approacting the Class *****
Engaging in a foreign language class shouldn't feel like a chore that you
resent having to perform. If it does, you should probably do some serious
thinking about why you are enrolled. A foreign language is a discipline to be
studied with attention and dedication. It requires a high level of
concentration, and a systematic, steady approach. It is in fact a never-ending
process, which involves a consistent accumulation of data (vocabulary) to be
applied within a complex framework (grammar). As such, learning a foreign
language is often frustrating and so it should be dealt with patiently. But the
result of understanding of a foreign language provides lifelong satisfaction.
If you approach this course by wondering how little work you can do and still
get by, or if you approach this class by thinking only about what grade you are
getting instead of what you are learning, then you will not succeed. If,
however, you approach this class with dedication and a positive attitude, I
guarantee that you will be rewarded with the satisfaction that comes from the
genuine acquisition of knowledge and skill.
