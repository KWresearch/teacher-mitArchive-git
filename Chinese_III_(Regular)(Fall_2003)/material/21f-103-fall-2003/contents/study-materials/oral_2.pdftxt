Exercise 2.  	 Describe Dawei’s trip to Shanghai.   

After flying almost 20 hours, Dawei’s plane finally lands at Shanghai airport.  He 
hurries to get his luggage, and walks toward the exit because he thinks someone from 
Shanghai University is waiting for him outside.  He sees many people at the exit, either 
calling somebody’s name loudly or holding a board with someone’s name.  At the exit, 
he looks around, but doesn’t see any board with his name.  He feels so strange because he 
got a letter from the office of foreign students, Shanghai University indicating that 
someone would come and meet him.  He wonders whether he told the university a wrong 
arrival date or the university wrote down a wrong date.  He gets a feeling that he has to 
go to the university himself. Since this is his first time that he’s been to Shanghai, and 
Shanghai is such a big city, he has to take a taxi to get there because he thinks that a taxi 
driver would know where the university was.
