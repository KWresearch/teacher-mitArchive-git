PROBLEM  SET  8


Collaboration  policy:  You are encouraged to freely discuss homework problems with other 8.012 
students and teaching staﬀ.  However, you must write  up  your  solutions  completely  on  your 
own—do  not  simply  copy  solutions  from  other  students.  You  are  forbidden  from  consulting 
solutions  from  previous  years  or  from  the  web.  Violations  of  this  policy  may  result  in 
disciplinary  action.

8.  Rectangular  Symmetry.  [15  points]


A ﬂat, uniform rectangle with sides of length a and b is at rest in free space (there are initially 
no  external  forces  acting).  You  strike  two  opposite  corners  with  equal  and  opposite  forces  F�
as  indicated  for  a  short  time  period  Δt. 

(a)  [5 pts] Calculate the moments of inertia of the rectangle about horizontal ( ˆx) and vertical 
( ˆy)  axes  passing  through  its  center  of  mass.  Note  that  this  does  not  require  calculating 
the  moment  of  inertia  tensor.  Verify  your  answers  by  showing  that  these  moments  of 
inertia  satisfy  the  perpendicular  axis  theorem,  Ix  + Iy  =  Iz ,  where  Iz  is  the  moment  of 
inertia  about  an  axis  coming  out  of  the  page  ( ˆz )  through  the  center  of mass  (which  you 
should  also  calculate). 
[10  pts]  Calculate  the  spin  vector  (ω� )  and  angular  momentum  vector  (L� )  immediately 
after  the  strike.  Show  that  these  are  not  parallel,  and  that  the  spin  vector  points  along 
the  opposite  diagonal  from  where  the  forces  were  applied  if  a =�
b.

9.  Euler’s  Disk.  [15  points] 


If  you  spin  a  coin  (a  solid  uniform  disk)  about  a  vertical  axis  on  a  table,  it  will  eventually 
lose  energy  and  begin  to  wobble.  Wobbling  motion  can  basically  be  described  as  the  rolling 
of  the  coin  without  slipping  while  tilted  from  horizontal  by  an  angle  α.  Assume  that  once 
the  coin  starts  to wobble,  it  falls  suﬃciently  slowly  tht  you  can  assume α  is  constant  and  the 
center  of  mass  remains  at  a  ﬁxed  point.  Let  ωs  be  the  spin  frequency  of  the  coin,  and  Ω  be 
the  frequency  at  which  the  contact  point  traces  a  circle  on  the  table.

[5  pts]  Show  that  the  total  angular  velocity  vector  �ω  of  the  coin  has magnitude  Ω sin α 
and  points  in  a  direction  from  the  contact  point  up  through  the  center  of  mass  of  the 
coin. 
� 
[5  pts]  Show  that: 
g 
Ω = 2 
L sin α 
and  discuss what  happens  at  the  limits  of  α.  It  helps  to  verify  that  the  direction  of  �ω  is 
along  one  of  the  principal  axes  of  the  coin. 
� 
[5  pts]  Show  that,  when  viewed  from  above,  the  face  of  the  coin  appears  to  rotate with 
frequency 
Ω = 2(1 − cos α) 
g
L sin α
