PROBLEM  SET  6


Collaboration  policy:  You are encouraged to freely discuss homework problems with other 8.012 
students and teaching staﬀ.  However, you must write  up  your  solutions  completely  on  your 
own—do  not  simply  copy  solutions  from  other  students.  You  are  forbidden  from  consulting 
solutions  from  previous  years  or  from  the  web.  Violations  of  this  policy  may  result  in 
disciplinary  action.

8.012  Pro ject  Proposal:  The  8.012  Pro ject  is  a  design-your-own  pro ject  to  explore  some  of 
the  concepts  we’ve  been  learning  in  class.  It  is  free-form  in  the  sense  you  can  design  any  kind 
of  (reasonable)  pro ject  you  can  think  of  related  to  the  class,  but  in  the  spirit  of  Newton  should 
nevertheless be experimental  in design.  The pro ject  itself will be due on Wednesday,  November 
26th  in  your  recitation  section,  and  is  worth  5%  of  your  total  grade. 

Here  are  the  ground  rules  for  the  8.012  pro ject  (see  also  the  8.012  webpage):

The  pro ject must  an  experiment  based  on  principles  we  have  learned  in  8.012. 

The  pro ject  should  test  an  idea  (such  as  the  conservation  of  momentum),  verify  a  result 
from  the  psets  (such  as  conﬁrming  the  properties  of  the  capstan),  demonstrate  a  physical 
concept  (similar  to  the  classroom  demos)  or  examine  a  unique mechanical  situation  (such  as 
examining  the  motion  of  coupled-pendulum  system). 

The pro ject can be mechanical (i.e., building something), purely experimental (i.e., measuring 
the motion of a simple system) or numerical (i.e., simulating a physical problem on computer). 

Each pro ject is to be accompanied by a 3-5 page write-up, as well as any accompanying media 
(e.g.,  pictures,  video  or  computer  simulation). 

You  may  work  in  groups  of  up  to  4  people. 

Each  pro ject  will  be  graded  according  to  its  description  of  the  physics  underlying  the  ex­
periment,  design  and  execution  of  the  experiment  and  analysis/description  of  the  results. 
Creativity  will  be  rewarded!

The  ob jective  here  is  to  draft  up  a  pro ject  proposal  which  you  will  hand  in  during  your  recitation 
section  on Wednesday,  October  29th.  The  proposal must  include: 

•	 A  title  and  name(s)  of  those  working  on  the  pro ject; 
•	 A  brief  description  of  the  pro ject  itself  (general  idea,  design,  goals); 
•	 A  description  of  how  the  pro ject  is  speciﬁcally  related  to  the  physical  principles  discussed  in 
8.012; 
•	 A  description  of  the  resources  you  may  need  to  complete  the  pro ject  and  how  you  aim  to 
obtain  those  resources; 
•	 The  proposal must  be  no  longer  than  one  (1)  page,  single-spaced,  12-point  font. 

The instructors will assess your pro ject idea and either give you/your group the go-ahead or suggest 
a  revised  pro ject  plan.  No  8.012  pro ject  can  be  done  without  an  accepted  proposal,  and 
no  late  proposals  will  be  accepted,  so  be  sure  to  get  your  proposals  in  on October  29th.  Only 
one  proposal  per  group  needs  to  be  turned  in;  if  your  group  spans  multiple  recitations,  please 
designate  one  (responsible!)  member  of  your  group  to  hand  in  the  proposal. 

Some  examples  of  last  year’s  pro jects  are  on  the  8.012  website.  Have  fun  brainstorming  ideas!

7.  Hanging  Cylinder.  [10  points] 


A  cylinder  of  mass  M  and  radius  R  is  suspended  at  one  side  by  a  length  of  rope,  while 
the  other  side  rests  against  a  vertical  wall.  The  coeﬃcient  of  friction  between  the  wall  and 
cylinder  surfaces  is  µ.  The  rope  extends  oﬀ  at  an  angle  θ  relative  to  the  vertical  wall.  The 
whole  system  remains  at  rest.  Constant  gravity  acts  downward. 

What  is  the  minimum  angle  θ  for  which  this  setup  remains  stationary?  Explain  why  this  is 
a  minimum  angle  and  not  a  maximum  angle  (i.e.,  explain  what  happens  if  the  ball  is  placed 
higher  or  lower  on  the  wall).
