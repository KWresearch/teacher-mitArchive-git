Collaboration  policy:  You are encouraged to freely discuss homework problems with other 8.012 
students and teaching staﬀ.  However, you must write  up  your  solutions  completely  on  your 
own—do  not  simply  copy  solutions  from  other  students.  You  are  forbidden  from  consulting 
solutions  from  previous  years  or  from  the  web.  Violations  of  this  policy  may  result  in 
disciplinary  action.

10.  Moment  of  Inertia  of  a  Water  Molecule.  [15  points]


The  water  molecule,  H2O,  is  composed  of  2  atoms  of  hydrogen  (molecular  weight  1  amu  = 
1.66×10−27  kg) each bonded to one atom of oxygen (molecular weight 16 amu) in a triangular 
arrangement.  The  oxygen-hydrogen  bonds  have  a  length  r  =  9.6×10−11  m  and  are  set  apart 
by  an  angle  of  104.5o .  Treat  each  atom  as  a  point mass. 

(a)	

(b)	

[10  pts]  Determine  the  center  of  mass  position  of  the  water  molecule,  and  ﬁnd  the 
principal  axes  that  pass  through  this  center  of  mass.  Conﬁrm  these  axes  by  calculating 
the moment  of  inertia  tensor  in  the  principal  axes  frame.  You  can  write  your  answer  in 
terms  of  bond  length  r  and  hydrogen  mass mH . 
[5  pts]  About  which  axis  is  torque-free  rotation  unstable  (i.e,  will  lead  to  tumbling 
motion)?
