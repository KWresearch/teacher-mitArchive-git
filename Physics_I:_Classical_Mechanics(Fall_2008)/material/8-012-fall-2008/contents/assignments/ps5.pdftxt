Collaboration  policy:  You are encouraged to freely discuss homework problems with other 8.012 
students and teaching staﬀ.  However, you must write  up  your  solutions  completely  on  your 
own—do  not  simply  copy  solutions  from  other  students.  You  are  forbidden  from  consulting 
solutions  from  previous  years  or  from  the  web.  Violations  of  this  policy  may  result  in 
disciplinary  action.

10. 	 Solar  Energy.  [15  points] 

There  is  considerable  discussion  today  about  switching  over  to  renewable  resources  for  our 
energy needs—wind,  solar,  tidal, biofuel—for both conservation and economics.  In  this prob­
lem  you  are  to  examine whether  one  of  these  solutions—Solar  power—is  a  viable  solution  for 
Boston  using  estimation  and  order  of  magnitude  approximations.

[5  pts]  Estimate  the  average  electrical  power  used  by  people  in  Boston,  measured  in 
Watts.  There  are  roughly  6 million  people  in  Boston. 
[5  pts]  Now  estimate  the  amount  of  useable  solar  energy  in  the  Boston  area.  First 
estimate the incident  ﬂux of radiation on the surface of the Earth, measured  in W/m2 . 
Then  estimate  how  much  of  that  ﬂux  can  reasonably  be  captured  over  the  course  of 
the  year,  including  the  eﬃciency  of  solar  panels  (roughly  10%),  the  fact  that  the  Sun  is 
only  up  in  the  daytime,  the  inclination  of  the  Sun  in  the  sky,  the  scattering  of  sunlight 
by  the  atmosphere  and  clouds,  etc.  Some  important  numbers:  the  luminosity  of  the 
Sun  (radiant  power)  is  roughly  4×1026  W,  the  Sun-Earth  distance  is  1.5×1011  m = 1 
Astronomical  Unit,  and  the metro  area  of  Boston  is  11,000  km2 . 
[5  pts]  Based  on  part  (b),  what  fraction  of  Boston’s  land  area  would  need  to  be  set 
aside  for  solar  panels  to  provide  electricity  for  everyone?  Does  this  seem  like  a  feasible 
approach?  What  are  some  of  the  practical  impediments  to  doing  this? 
[5 pts] Redo the calculation but just for your dorm building.  Could solar panels covering 
your dorm roof provide enough energy to power the whole building?  What about for the 
case of a single family home (assume 4 residents)?  Would simply covering every building 
top  in  solar  panels  provide  suﬃcient  electrical  energy? 
[5  pts]  The World  Resources  Institute  estimates  that  the  total  energy  usage  per  capita 
in  the United  States  is  roughly  80,000  kiloWatt-hours  per  year  (what  is  this  in Watts?). 
What  accounts  for  the  diﬀerence  between  this  number  and  your  estimate  in  (a)?  With 
this  value,  could  solar  panels meet  all  of  the  energy  needs  of  Boston  in  the  near  future?
