10.  Spinning  up  Figure  Skater.


(a)  The  derivation  of  the  rotational  ﬁctional  forces  we  did  in  class  (coriolis  and  centrifugal) 
assumed that the spin vector �ω was constant in time.  Relax this constraint and derive an 
additional  ﬁctional  force  that  depends  on  the  ω�˙ (this  is  known  as  the  azimuthal  force). 
(b)  We  found  earlier  that  the  spin  up  of  an  ice  skater  as  she  brings  her  hands  in  can  be 
attributed  to  conservation  of  angular  momentum  (for  diﬀerent  moments  of  inertia). 
Let’s  examine  this  in  the  skater’s  frame  of  reference.  Assume  our  skater  has  hands  of 
mass M  extended  initially  at  a  radius  R  from  her  body,  attached  to  eﬀectively massless 
arms  and  an  eﬀectively  massless  body  (think:  spherical  cow).  She  is  initially  rotating 
with  spin  vector  ω� pointing  upwards.  Our  skater  moves  her  hands  slowly  toward  the 
center  of  her  body  at  a  rate  ˙r .  Based  on  the  fact  that  the  skater  does  not  spin  up  in  her 
own  frame  of  reference  (always  true!),  and  considering  all  ﬁctional  forces  in  her  rotating 
frame  of  reference,  derive  an  expression  for  ˙ω  in  terms  of  ω , R and  ˙r . 
(c)  Derive  this  same  expression  by  examining  the  evolution  of  angular  momentum  in  the 
inertial  reference  frame. 
(d)  If  the  skater  pulls  her  hands  in  to  half  their  original  radius,  by  how much  does  she  spin 
up?
