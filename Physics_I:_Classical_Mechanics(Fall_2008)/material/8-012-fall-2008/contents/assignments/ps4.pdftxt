Collaboration  policy:  You are encouraged to freely discuss homework problems with other 8.012 
students and teaching staﬀ.  However, you must write  up  your  solutions  completely  on  your 
own—do  not  simply  copy  solutions  from  other  students.  You  are  forbidden  from  consulting 
solutions  from  previous  years  or  from  the  web.  Violations  of  this  policy  may  result  in 
disciplinary  action.

9.  The  super-astro-blaster.  [15  points] 

In  class  we  demonstrated  how  the  astroblaster  (a  set  of  elastic  bouncing  balls  released  from 
rest and  rebounding  from  the ﬂoor)  can  launch  the  smallest and  topmost ball  to  considerable 
distance.  Let’s  push  this  to  the  test.  Assume  we  have  n  balls  of  mass  (left  ﬁgure  above) 
m1 , m2 , m3 ,  ...,  mn  where  m1  >>  m2  >>  m3  >>  ...  >  mn .  The  most  massive  ball  is  at 
bottom  and  starts  at  rest  at  a  height  H  =  1  meter  above  the  ground.  Assume  that  all  balls 
bounce  elastically,  that  constant  gravitational  acceleration  �g  points  downward,  and  that  air 
resistance  and  realistic  limits  in  the  elasticity  of  the  balls  can  be  ignored. 

(a)  (10  points)  In  terms  of  n,  to what  height  does  the  top  ball  bounce?  How many  balls  do 
you  need  to  reach  1  kilometer? 
(b)  (5  points)  How  many  balls  do  you  need  to  achieve  escape  velocity?	 You  will  need  to 
determine  an  expression  for  escape  velocity  from  the Earth, which  is  possible  (to within 
an  order  of  magnitude)  through  dimensional  analysis. 

10. 	 A  falling  chain.  [10  points] 

You hold a chain of mass M,  length L and uniform mass density λ  from one end above a ﬁxed 
table  (right  ﬁgure  above).  The  chain  falls  under  constant  gravitational  acceleration.  Ignore 
any swinging or bouncing  in the chain and assume  that  it moves purely  in a vertical direction 
until  it  comes  to  rest  hanging  straight  down  below  the  table. 
(10 points) What  is the support  force  from the table, FS , as a  function of time after the chain 
is  released?
