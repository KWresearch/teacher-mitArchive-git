Collaboration  policy:  You are encouraged to freely discuss homework problems with other 8.012 
students and teaching staﬀ.  However, you must write  up  your  solutions  completely  on  your 
own—do  not  simply  copy  solutions  from  other  students.  You  are  forbidden  from  consulting 
solutions  from  previous  years  or  from  the  web.  Violations  of  this  policy  may  result  in 
disciplinary  action.

11.  Bridge  Building.  (10  points) 


A mass M (perhaps a car) sits at the center of a bridge made up of three equilateral triangles of 
beams.  Assume  that  these  seven  beams  are  eﬀectively massless,  and  that  they  are  connected 
to  each  other  by  hinges  at  the  very  ends  (so  forces  only  act  at  the  ends  of  each  beam).  The 
supports  at  either  end  of  the  bridge  only  provide  vertical  forces  to  hold  the  bridge  the  car 
up.  Assume  constant  gravitational  acceleration �g  acts  downward. 

(a)  (10  points)  Find  the  forces  on  each  hinge  point  of  each  beam  (both  magnitude  and 
direction) and specify whether these  forces are compressive or tensive (i.e., do they push 
the  beam  in  or  stretch  it  out?).  It  is  helpful  to  draw  force  diagrams  for  each  beam  to 
work  out  where  each  force  originates. 
(b)  (10  points  EXTRA  CREDIT  CHALLENGE)  Find  the  forces  on  2n+1  beams  making 
up  an  n-triangle  bridge  (i.e.,  generalize  your  result  above). 

12. 	 Order  of  Magnitude  Estimates.  (10  points) 
Last week we introduced dimensional analysis as a means of estimating the functional forms of 
physical quantities from basic principles.  This week you are going to make order of magnitude 
estimates of some physical quantities.  Try to make these estimates without using a calculator! 
One  of  the  important  skills  of  a  physicist  or  engineer  is  to  be  able  to  calculate  on  the  spot. 

(a)  (2 points) The  entire population  of Earth  lines up,  holding  each  others hands with  arms 
outstretched.  How  many  times  would  this  human  chain  wrap  around  the  Earth?  The 
Earth’s  radius  is  roughly  6×106  m. 
(b)  (2  points)  Astronomers  typically  measure  the  angular  motion  of  nearby  stars  in  units 
of  arcseconds/year,  where  an  arcsecond  is  1/3600th  of  a  degree.  If  we  were  to  pro ject 
the  angular  motion  onto  the  Moon  (a  distance  of  4×108  m),  what  speed  would  that 
correspond  to?  Is  this  speed closest  to  that of a  snail,  an Olympic  runner or a  jet plane? 
(c)  (3  points)  Crumple  zones  in  cars  are  designed  to  reduce  the  acceleration  in  a  collision 
with  a  stationary  ob ject.  Estimate  a  relation  between  the  size  of  the  crumple  zone,  the 
initial  speed  of  the  car,  and  the  acceleration  on  the  car’s  occupants  using  dimensional 
analysis.  For  a  collision  at  30  miles  per  hour,  what  is  the  minimum  crumple  zone  size 
needed  to  keep  accelerations  below  (a  fatal)  acceleration  of  20g.  How  does  this  size 
compare  to  the  length  of  a  typical  car? 
(d)  (3  points)  The  nearest  star  to  the  Sun  is  about  4  lightyears  away.	 Knowing  that  the 
speed  of  light  is  3×108  m/s,  and  that  the  typical  mass  of  a  star  is  roughly  1030  kg, 
estimate  the  mass  density  of  stars  (kg/m3 )  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Sun.  How  does  this 
compare  with  the  density  of  air?
