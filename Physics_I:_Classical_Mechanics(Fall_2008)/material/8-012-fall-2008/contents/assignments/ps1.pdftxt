Collaboration  policy:  You are encouraged to freely discuss homework problems with other 8.012 
students and teaching staﬀ.  However, you must write  up  your  solutions  completely  on  your 
own—do  not  simply  copy  solutions  from  other  students.  You  are  forbidden  from  consulting 
solutions  from  previous  years  or  from  the  web.  Violations  of  this  policy  may  result  in 
disciplinary  action.

9. 	 Two  Trains  and  a  Bee.  (15  points) 
Consider  two  trains moving  in  opposite  directions  on  the  same  track.  The  trains  start  simul­
taneously  from  two  towns,  Aville  and  Bville,  separated  by  a  distance  d.  Each  train  travels 
toward  each  other  with  constant  speed  v .  A  bee  is  initially  located  in  front  of  the  train  in 
Aville.  As  the  train  departs Aville,  the  bee  travels  with  speed  u > v  along  the  track  towards 
Bville.  When  it  encounters  the  second  train,  it  instantaneously  reverses  direction  until  it 
encounters  the  ﬁrst  train,  then  it  reverses  again,  etc.  The  bee  continues  ﬂying  between  the 
two  trains  until  it  is  crushed  between  the  trains  impacting  each  other.  The  purpose  of  this 
problem  is  to  compute  the  total  distance  ﬂown  by  the  bee  until  it  is  crushed.  Assume  that 
the  bee  is  faster  than  the  trains. 
There  are  at  least  two  good  ways  to  solve  this  problem.  One  is  to  compute  the  distance  for 
each  ﬂight  leg  and  sum  the  resulting  series.  There  is  also  another  way  to  solve  the  problem 
with  very  little  calculation.  You  are  to  do  it  both  ways. 
(a)  (10  points)  Find  an  expression  for  the  distance  dn  covered  by  the  bee  after  its  nth 
encounter  with  a  train.  Deﬁne  d0  as  the  distance  traveled  during  the  ﬁrst  ﬂight  from 
Aville  towards  the  train  near Bville,  d1  the  distance  traveled  by  the  bee  during  the  ﬁrst 
trip  from  the  Bville  train  to  the  Aville  train,  etc.  Sum  the  resulting  series  to  get  the 
ﬁnal  answer. 
(b)  (5  points)  Devise  another  way  to  obtain  the  same  answer  using  very  little  calculation. 

10. 	 Dimensional  Analysis.  (15  points) 
You  can  often  derive  the  solution  of  a  problem  by  considering  the  dimensions  of  the  rele­
vant  variables,  including  all  related  fundamental  constants,  and match  the  dimensions  of  the 
quantity  you want  to  determine.  This  is  called  dimensional  analysis,  and  it  is  a  powerful  ap­
proximation  technique  as well  as  a method  of determining how  quantities  scale with diﬀerent 
variables.  The basic  idea  is to write the unknown quantity (X ) as a  factor of all your relevant 
variables  (Vn )  and  constants  (Cn ): 

e ...	
X  = V1 
dC2 
cC1 
bV3 
aV2 
and  then  solve  for  the  powers  a, b, c, d, e,  ...  so  that  the  dimensions  on  both  sides  of  the 
equation  work  out.

(a)  (3  points)  Derive  an  expression  for  the  vibration  frequency  of  a  star  of  mass 	 M  and 
radius  R,  if  that  vibration  is  caused  by  gravitational  instabilities. 
(b)  (4  points)  Derive  an  expression  for  the  drag  force  on  a  ball  of  radius  R  and  mass  M 
moving  with  velocity  v  through  a  medium  with  mass  density  ρ. 
(c)  (4 points) Derive an  expression  for  the  terminal velocity of a  falling ball of  radius R  and 
mass  M  close  to  the  surface  of  the  Earth,  when  it  experiences  a  drag  force  of  the  form 
F  = bv2 .  Can  you  ﬁnd  an  alternate  way  of  deriving  this  velocity? 
(d)  (4  points)  Derive  an  expression  for  the  frequency  of  a  pendulum  of  mass  M ,  hanging 
from  a  rope  of  length  L  near  the  surface  of  the  Earth,  released  from  rest  at  an  initial 
angle  θ0 .  Warning!  θ0  is  dimensionless.  Is  it  possible  to  constrain  how  the  frequency 
depends  on  this  variable?
