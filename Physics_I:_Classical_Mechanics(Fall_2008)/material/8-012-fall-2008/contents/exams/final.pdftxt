Problem 2: Atwood Machine [15 pts]

M 

d 

µ

2M 

α 

An Atwood machine consists of a fixed pulley wheel of radius R and uniform mass
M (a disk), around which an effectively massless string passes connecting two
blocks of mass M and 2M.  The lighter block is initially positioned a distance d
above the ground.  The heavier block sits on an inclined plane with opening angle 
α.  There is a coefficient of friction µ between the surfaces of this block and the
inclined plane. Constant gravitational force acts downwards, and assume that the
string never slips. 
(a) [5 pts] Determine two conditions on the angle α which allow the lighter block
to move up or move down. 
(b) [10 pts] Assuming that the lighter block moves down, determine its
acceleration.

Problem 3: Rocket in an Interstellar Cloud [15 pts] 

2R 

MR  + MF

N particles/m3 

A cylindrical rocket of diameter 2R, mass MR and containing fuel of mass MF is 
coasting through empty space at velocity v0.  At some point the rocket enters a
uniform cloud of interstellar particles with number density N (e.g., particles/m3),
with each particle having mass m (<< MR) and initially at rest.  To compensate for
the dissipative force of the particles colliding with the rocket, the rocket engines
emit fuel at a rate dm/dt = γ at a constant velocity u with respect to the rocket.
Ignore gravitational effects between the rocket and cloud particles. 
(a) [5 pts] Assuming that the dissipative force from the cloud particles takes the
form F = –Av2, where A is a constant, derive the equation of motion of the rocket
(F = ma) through the cloud as it is firing its engines. 
(b) [5 pts] What must the rocket’s thrust be to maintain a constant velocity v0? 
(c) [5 pts] If the rocket suddenly runs out of fuel, what is its velocity as a function
of time after this point? 
(d) [BONUS 5 pts] Assuming that each cloud particle bounces off the rocket
elastically, and collisions happen very frequently (i.e., collisions are continuous),
prove that the dissipative force is proportional to v2, and determine the constant A.
Assume that the front nose-cone of the rocket has an opening angle of 90º.

2M 

A uniform disk of mass M and diameter 2R moves toward another uniform disk of 
mass 2M and diameter 2R on the surface of a frictionless table.  The first disk has 
an initial velocity v0 and spin rate ω0 as indicated, while the second disk is initially
stationary.  When the first disk contacts the second (a “glancing” collision), they
instantly stick to each other and move as a single object. 
(a) [5 pts] What are the velocity and spin angular velocity of the combined disks
after the collision? Indicate both magnitudes and directions. 
(b) [5 pts] For what value of ω0 would the combined disks not rotate? 
(c) [5 pts] How much total mechanical energy is lost in this collision?

Problem 5: Cylindrical Top [15 pts] 

L 

M 

r 

COM 

Δp 

R 

µ = 0 

A cylinder of mass M, length L and radius R is spinning about its long axis with
on a frictionless horizontal surface.  The cylinder is
angular velocity 
given a sharp, horizontal strike with impulse Δp  at a distance r from its center of 
  
mass (COM). Assume that constant gravitational acceleration acts downward.
NOTE: you do not need to use Euler’s equations to solve this problem. 
(a) [5 pts] What is the translational velocity of the cylinder after the impulse
(magnitude and direction)? 
(b) [5 pts] The strike imparts an angular momentum impulse to the cylinder which
causes it to lift up at one end.  At what angle α will the cylinder be tilted after the
impulse and which end of the cylinder lifts up?  Assume that the angular
momentum impulse is much smaller than the spin angular momentum. 
(c) [5 pts] After the cylinder tilts up, it effectively becomes a top.  Determine its 
precessional rate and the direction of precession.  Assume that nutational motion is 
negligible (i.e., α remains effectively constant) and that R << L (i.e., that the
cylinder can be approximated as a thin rod for this part). 
(d) [5 pts BONUS] For a strong enough impulse, the cylinder will tilt high enough
to precess in the opposite direction.  What is the minimum tilt angle for this to
happen and what is the minimum impulse required? (Note that you cannot assume
R << L here. This problem is similar to the “tipping battery” trick pointed out by
one of the 8.012 students.)

Problem 6: Bead on a Spinning Rod [15 pts] 

ω 

M 

r0 

A bead of mass M is placed on a frictionless, rigid rod that is spun about at one end
at a rate ω.  The bead is initially held at a distance r0 from the end of the wire.  For 
the questions below, treat the bead as a point mass.  Ignore gravitational forces. 

(a) [5 pts] What force is necessary to hold the bead in place at r0?  Indicate both 
magnitude and direction. 
(b) [5 pts] After the bead is released, what is its position in the inertial frame (in
polar coordinates) as a function of time? 
(c) [5 pts] Now calculate the fictitious forces on the bead in a reference frame that
is rotating with the wire.  What real force must the rod exert on the bead in both the 
rotating and inertial frames?

Problem 7: Central Potential [15 pts] 

A particle of mass m moves within a region under the influence of a force of the
form 

The particle is initially at a distance r0 from the origin of the force, and initially
moves with velocity v0 in a tangential direction. 

(a) [5 pts] Derive and sketch the effective potential of this system as a function of
radius from the origin. Indicate all important inflection points.  Can the particle
pass through the origin of this reference frame? 
(b) [5 pts] Find the velocity v0 required for the particle to move in a purely circular
orbit at a radius r0 with this force law. 
(c) [5 pts] Compute the frequency of small oscillations about this equilibrium
radius.  How does the period of these oscillations compare to the orbital period?
