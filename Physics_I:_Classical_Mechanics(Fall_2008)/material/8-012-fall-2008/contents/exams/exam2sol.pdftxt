Problem 1: Quick Multiple Choice Questions [10 pts] 
For each of the following questions circle the correct answer. You do not need to 
show any work. 

(a) Which of the following is the result of an elastic
collision between the two isolated objects at right? 

This can be verified by examining conservation of momentum and energy (since it
is an elastic collision). 

(b) Which experiences the largest impulse? 
Fully inelastic 
Fully elastic
collision of 10 kg 
collision of 20 kg 
ball dropped 
ball dropped 
from 10 m 
from 10 m 

Fully elastic
collision of 20 kg 
ball dropped 
from 5m 

These all have 
the same 
impulse 

The first two choices experience the same impulse, which equals (1 or 2) 
The 3rd  option experiences the largest impulse by a factor of 

.

Quiz 2 

(c) A cart traveling at speed v on a frictionless track starts to leak sand.  What is
the cart’s speed at a later time? 
Less than v 
Greater than v 
Equal to v 
The sand experiences no force from the cart as it leaves, so it applies no force on 

the cart and cannot change the cart’s momentum.

(d) Consider the composite disk at right, with a main 

section of mass density ρ and radius d, and a

subsection of mass density 2ρ and radius d/2.  If O

marks the origin of our coordinate system, at the 

center of the composite disk, where is the disk’s

center of mass located?


d/2 to right of O  d/6 to right of O  d/10 to right of O 
at O 
This can be determined using the center of mass formula, adding together the 

centers of mass of two solid disks with density ρ (superposition).

(e) A block connected to a fixed wall by a spring 
oscillates back and forth on a frictionless surface. 
When it reaches its maximum extent, a piece of clay 
is dropped onto it and instantaneously sticks.  Which 
of the following is conserved in this collision? 

Horizontal 
momentum 

Total 
Total mechanical 
mechanical 
energy and horizontal
energy 
momentum 
When the clay sticks, in comes to rest so its mechanical energy is not conserved.

However, the collision does not affect its horizonal momentum, which is 0, nor

that of the block.


None of these

Problem 2: Collision [20 pts] 

Two balls, one of mass m and one of mass 2m, approach from orthogonal
directions with identical speeds v and collide.  After the collision, the more 
massive ball moves with the same speed v but downward (orthogonal to its original
direction) and the less massive ball moves with speed U at an angle θ with respect 
to horizontal.  Assume that no external forces act during the collision. 

(a) [10 pts] Calculate the final speed U of the less massive ball and the angle θ. 

(b) [10 pts] Determine how much kinetic energy is lost or gained by the two balls
during the collision.  Is this collision elastic, inelastic or superelastic?

Quiz 2 

[SOLUTION]

(a) Momentum in both horizontal (x) and vertical (y) directions must be conserved, 
hence: 

so: 

so 

(b) The change in kinetic energy is just the change in the kinetic energy of the
small mass (since the big mass has the same KE before and after the collision): 

the collision is superelastic.

Problem 3: Cube on a Sphere [20 pts] 

A small block starts from rest and slides down from the top of a fixed sphere of
radius R, where R >> size of the block. The surface of the sphere is frictionless and 
constant gravitational acceleration g acts downward. 
(a) [10 pts] Determine the speed of the block as a function of angle from the top 
while it remains in contact with the sphere. 
(b) [10 pts] At what angle does the block lose contact with the sphere?

Quiz 2 

[SOLUTION]

(a) Only conservative forces are present, so total mechanical energy is conserved.
Hence the KE of the block comes simply from extracting gravitational potential
energy: 

(b) The block loses contact when the normal force
acting on it disappears.  Using  polar coordinates and 
the force diagram at right, we can write down the radial
equation of motion:

Quiz 2 

µ 

A rocket of total mass M0, half of which is fuel, starts at rest on a long horizontal 
table.  The coefficient of friction between the rocket and table surfaces is µ.  At 
time t = 0, the rocket is ignited, ejecting fuel out at a constant rate γ = |dM/dt| with 
velocity vex  relative to the rocket.  Constant gravitational acceleration g acts 
downward. 
(a) [10 pts] What condition must be met for the rocket to start moving at t = 0? 
(b) [10 pts] Assuming that the rocket satisfies this requirement, what is the
maximum speed VMAX  achieved by the rocket? 
(c) [5 pts] How far does the rocket go after it runs out of fuel?  You can express 
your answer in terms of VMAX. 
(d) [BONUS 5 pts] How far does the rocket travel in total?  For this you will need 
to make use of the following integral: 

Page 8 of 14

Quiz 2 

[SOLUTION] 
(a) The condition is that the rocket thrust (γvex) must exceed the force due to 
friction (µM0g).  Hence 

(b) The maximum speed occurs when the rocket has used up all its fuel (note: since
the friction force is not velocity-dependent,  there is no “terminal velocity” in this 
case).  Applying conservation of momentum including the impulse from friction 
over a time dt (see figure): 

where we use the fact that a positive dm mass ejected corresponds to –dM lost 
from the rocket’s total mass.  The three terms can be separately integrated: 

Page 9 of 14

Quiz 2 

tmax  is the time it takes for the fuel to run out, which is (M0/2)/ γ. Hence, 

(c) After the rocket runs out of fuel, the problem reduces to a simple mass
accelerated by a constant friction force: 

We can also solve this using energy, since the work done on the rocket to reduce 
its kinetic energy to 0 is simply the friction force acting over the distance the
rocket travels: 

(d) For those who attempted it, we simply use the expression of velocity as a
function of time from our derivation of the rocket equation above, and integrate 
this to get the distance traveled: 

where we now explicitly put in the time dependence of the rocket mass.  To 
integrate the first term on the right, we make the substitution:

Quiz 2 

Using our substitution for tmax  for the limits of u and solving the left side and 
second term on the right side: 

The total distance traveled is then

Problem 5: Planet Orbit [25 pts] 

A small planet of mass m is in a circular orbit of radius r around a star of mass M
and radius R in otherwise empty space (assume M >> m so the star is stationary). 

(a) [10 pts] Determine the potential energy U(r), the kinetic energy K(r) and the
total mechanical energy E(r) of the planet in terms of G, M and r assuming U→0 
as r→∞. 

(b) [5 pts] Determine the minimum amount of mechanical energy that must be
added to the planet to cause it to escape from the star (i.e., r→∞).  By what factor 
must the speed of the planet be increased to cause it to escape? 

(c) [5 pts] Now assume that the planet in subject to a viscous force of the form 

is the direction of motion.  Compute the loss of
where A is a constant and 
mechanical energy in one orbital period in terms of G, M, r and A. Assume that
this loss is small enough that neither the orbital radius nor speed of the planet 
changes appreciably in one orbit. 

(d) [5 pts] Building from (c), compute the change in radius of the planet in one
orbital period due to the viscous force and the corresponding radial velocity based 
on the assumptions above, in terms of G, M, r and A.  Does the planet fall into the 
star or away from it?

Quiz 2 

[SOLUTIONS]

(a) The potential can be derived from the force law: 

In this case we know that the constant C = 0 since U(∞) = 0.  Hence: 

Note the m is a factor in this and other expressions (mistakenly neglected in the 
question). 
The kinetic energy is 

but we can substitute this using the force law in polar coordinates: 

the total mechanical energy E = K + U is then: 

(b) The work required to effectively bring the planet to r = ∞ is simply that needed 
to climb the potential well to U = 0.  In other words: 

Page 13 of 14 

8.012 Fall 2008 

Quiz 2 

So the kinetic energy must double, which means the speed must increase by a 
factor of 
.

(c) The loss of mechanical energy simply comes from the work done by the
frictional force over one orbit (note: this is formally true since the potential energy 
doesn’t change – work only acts to change kinetic energy).  Hence: 

where the substitution for mv2  from above is used 

(d) We can also write the change in energy as: 

to compute a velocity, we note that this change in r occurs over one orbit period for
which: 

Thus: 

Note that the radial velocity is negative, so the planet falls in to the star.
