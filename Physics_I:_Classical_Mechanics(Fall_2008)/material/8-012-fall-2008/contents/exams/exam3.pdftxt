Quiz 3 

Problem 1: Quick Multiple Choice Questions [10 pts] 
For each of the following questions circle the correct answer. You do not need to 
show any work. 
(a) [2 pts] A bicycle rider pedals up a hill with constant velocity 
v. In which direction does friction act on the wheels? 

Uphill 

Downhill	

Friction does not act while the 
bike moves at constant velocity 

(b) [2 pts] A gyroscope is set to spin so that its
spin vector points back to the mount.  The 
gryoscope is initially set at an angle α below 
horizontal and released from rest.  Gravity acts
downward.  In which direction does the 
precession angular velocity vector point once
the gyroscope starts to precess? 
Down 
Up	

Into the page 

Out of the page 

(c) [2 pts] A ball attached to rope is twirled around a stick as 
shown in the diagram at right.  Ignore gravity and friction. Which 
of the following quantities is conserved in the motion of the ball?
Be sure to write down all of the choices below that apply. 

Energy 

Momentum 

Angular 
Momentum 

None of these are 
conserved

Quiz 3 

(d) [2 pts] A force F is applied to two 
identical dumbbells, each comprised of
two masses separated by a thin rod.  The
force is applied at the center of mass for
the left dumbbell and directly on one of
the masses for the right dumbbell.  If the 
forces are applied for the same duration of
time, which dumbbell acquires the
greatest center of mass velocity? 

Left dumbbell 

Right dumbbell 

They both have the same
velocity 

(e) [2 pts] For the same dumbbells in part (d), which one acquires the greatest
kinetic energy from the applied force? 

Left dumbbell 

Right dumbbell 

They both have the same
kinetic energy

Quiz 3 

Problem 2: Catch Pendulum [20 pts] 

A pendulum consists of a ball of mass M attached to the end of a rigid bar of
length 2d which is pivoted at the center.  At the other end of the bar is a container 
(“catch”).  A second ball of mass M/2 is thrown into the catch at a velocity v where 
it sticks.  For this problem, ignore the mass of the pendulum bar and catch, and 
treat the balls as if they were point masses (i.e., neglect their individual moments 
of inertia). 
(a) [5 pts] What is the initial angular rotation rate of the pendulum after the
incoming ball is caught? 
(b) [5 pts] How much total mechanical energy is lost when the incoming ball gets
stuck in the catch? 
(c) [10 pts] What minimum velocity does the incoming ball need in order to invert
the pendulum (i.e., rotate it by 180º)?

Quiz 3 

Problem 3: Swinging bar [25 pts] 

A uniform bar of mass M and length d is pivoted at one end.  The bar is released 
from rest in a horizontal position and allowed to fall under constant gravitational
acceleration. 
(a) [5 pts] How much work does the contact force apply to the system as a function 
of angle? 
(b) [5 pts] What is the angular speed of the bar as a function of angle? 
(c) [5 pts] What is the angular acceleration of the bar as a function of angle? 
(d) [10 pts] What are the vertical and horizontal forces the bar exerts on the pivot 
as a function of time angle?

Quiz 3 

Problem 4: Atwood machine [25 pts] 

An Atwood machine consists of a fixed pulley wheel of radius R, a rim of mass M
and 6 spokes each with length R and mass M.  An effectively massless string 
passes around the pulley wheel and connects two plates of mass M and 2M.  The 
lighter plate is initially on the ground when the system is released from rest.
Constant gravitational force acts downwards, and assume that the string never
slips. 
(a) [5 pts] Calculate the moment of inertia of the pulley wheel. 
(b) [10 pts] Calculate the speed of the more massive plate when it hits the ground 
(there are multiple ways to solve this). 
(c) [10 pts] Assume that when it strikes the ground, the heavier plate sticks.
Furthermore, the string remains “stuck” to the wheel, so it continues to pull the
lighter plate up.  How high does the lighter plate go?

Problem 5: Rolling a coin [20 pts] 

M 
α 

2b 

R 

A coin (uniform solid circular disk) with mass M and radius b is set to roll in a
circular path of radius R on a table surface (R > b).  The coin is given a spin 
angular velocity ωS, and as it rolls it is found to tilt at a small angle α with respect 
to vertical.  Assume that the coin does not slip; constant gravity acts downward. 
(a) [5 pts] Determine the “precession” angular velocity of the rolling motion, Ω,
both magnitude and direction. 
(b) [5 pts] Determine the total angular velocity vector, 
, including both spin and 
precession terms, in a polar coordinate system centered on the center of the coin’s
trajectory. 
(c) [10 pts] Solve for the angle α in terms of the quantities given in the diagram 
above.  Be sure to examine all equations of motion! 

(d) [10 pts BONUS] Determine the total angular momentum vector, 
, in terms of 
the quantities given in the diagram above, in a polar coordinate system centered on 
the center of the coin’s trajectory.  For simplicity, assume that α is very small (i.e., 
only consider first order terms in α).
