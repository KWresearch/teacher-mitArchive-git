Quiz 1 

(c) You pull a brick of mass M sitting on 

a flat table using a thick rope of mass m.

Friction between the surface of the table

and the brick is sufficient so that the brick 

remains at rest.  Compared to the force with which you pull on one end of the rope,

the force that the other end of the rope exerts on the brick is:

The same 
Greater 
Less 

Zero 

(d) As a swinging pendulum passes through its lowest point, in which direction 
does the total net force act? 

Only in an 
angular direction 

Only in a radial
direction 

In both angular 
and radial 
directions 

There is zero net 
force at the 
equilibrium point 

(e) A pendulum with mass M and length L is released as a small angle off of
vertical and oscillates with period P.  If we double the mass and halve the length of 
the pendulum then the new period is

Problem 2: The Accelerated Atwood Machine [30 pts] 

Two blocks of masses M1  and M2  (M2  > M1) are stacked on top of each other and 
start at rest on the surface of a frictionless table.  The masses are connected via an 
ideal pulley (massless string and nearly massless pulley wheel), and the coefficient
of static friction (assumed equal to the coefficient of kinetic friction) between the 
block surfaces is µS. The pulley is accelerated to the right by a force 
, resulting 
in an acceleration of the pulley wheel of 
.  Assume that gravity acts with 
constant acceleration g downward. 
(a) [5 pts] Draw force diagrams for each of the blocks and the pulley wheel, clearly 
indicating all horizontal and vertical forces acting on them. 
(b) [5 pts] If the blocks do not slip relative to each other, what are their
accelerations? 
(c) [10 pts] Assume that the blocks do slip relative to each other.  Determine each 
block’s horizontal acceleration as a function of the parameters specified above
(i.e., M1, M2, µS, g, a and F).  Which block has a higher acceleration?  Be sure to 
work in an inertial reference frame! 
(d) [10 pts] What is the minimum force F required to cause one block to slip 
relative to the other?  Assume that the mass of the pulley is negligible compared to 
those of the blocks.

Problem 3: Hanging Rope [20 pts] 

Consider a rope of total mass M and length L suspended at rest from a fixed 
mount.  The rope has a linear mass density that varies with height as λ(z) = 
λ0sin(πz/L) where λ0  is a constant.  Constant gravitational acceleration g acts 
downward. 
(a) [5 pts] Determine the constant λ0. 
(b) [5 pts] What is the tension force at the free (bottom) end of the rope? 
(c) [10 pts] Calculate the tension along the rope as a function of distance z below
the mount.

Problem 4: Don’t Slip! [20 pts] 

M 

r 

µ 

An 8.012 student of mass M stands on a rigid disk at a distance r from the center
axis.  Assume that the coefficient of friction between the student’s shoes and the 
disk surface is µ.  At time t = 0, the disk begins to rotate with a constant angular 
acceleration rate 
.  Assume that gravity acts with constant acceleration g 
downward. 
(a) [5 pts] What is the maximum value of angular acceleration rate (αmax) such that 
the student does not immediately slip? 
(b) [10 pts] Assuming that α < αmax, what is the total friction force acting on the
student as a function of time (prior to slipping)?  Write your answer as a vector in 
polar coordinates. 
(c) [5 pts] Assuming that α < αmax, how long after the disk starts rotating will the 
student slip?

Problem 5: Will the LHC Destroy the World? [20 pts] 

There has been some speculation that the Large Hadron Collider (or LHC), a
particle accelerator experiment that will smash protons together at incredible 
energies, might create a small black hole that could devour the Earth.  Let’s
imagine that the LHC does create such a black hole of mass M (assume initially 
than M << MEartg).  Once it has formed (initially at rest), the black hole will 
immediately fall under the influence of gravity toward the center of the Earth.
Assume for this problem that the Earth has a constant volume mass density ρ, and 
that the black hole doesn’t eat that much of the Earth as it passes through it. 
(a) [5 pts] Using dimensional analysis, come up with an order-of-magnitude
expression for the oscillation period of the black hole as it passes through the Earth 
based on the relevant parameters of this problem. 
(b) [10 pts] Now show that the black hole undergoes simple harmonic motion 
(similar to spring motion) by determining its acceleration as a function of time, and 
derive an expression for the oscillation period.  How does this compare with your
answer in part (a)? 
(c) [5 pts] The Earth does not have a constant mass density but rather gets denser 
closer to its center.  Assuming that it is still spherically symmetric, would this fact
cause the oscillation period of the black hole to be shorter or longer?  Justify your 
answer. 
(d) [10 pts BONUS] Assume that the particle collision that creates the black hole 
converts the equivalent of an entire year’s worth of global energy production 
(about 5x1020  Newton-meters) into a single black hole at rest.  Also, the radius of a 
black hole is the distance at which the gravitational escape velocity exceeds the 
speed of light.  Based on these assumptions, use dimensional analysis to estimate
the mass and radius of the black hole to within an order of magnitude.  Based on 
these values, should we worry about an LHC black hole?  Some important 
numbers for this question are the gravitational constant, G ≈ 7x10-11  m3  kg-1s-2; the 
speed of light, c ≈ 3x108  m/s; and, for comparison, the radius of a proton, rproton  ≈ 
10-15  m, and the radius of the Earth, REarth  ≈ 6x106  m.
