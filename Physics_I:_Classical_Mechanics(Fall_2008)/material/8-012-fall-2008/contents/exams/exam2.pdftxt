Quiz 2 

Problem 2: Collision [20 pts] 

Two balls, one of mass m and one of mass 2m, approach from orthogonal
directions with identical speeds v and collide.  After the collision, the more 
massive ball moves with the same speed v but downward (orthogonal to its original
direction) and the less massive ball moves with speed U at an angle θ with respect 
to horizontal.  Assume that no external forces act during the collision. 

(a) [10 pts] Calculate the final speed U of the less massive ball and the angle θ. 

(b) [10 pts] Determine how much kinetic energy is lost or gained by the two balls
during the collision.  Is this collision elastic, inelastic or superelastic?

Problem 3: Cube on a Sphere [20 pts] 

A small block starts from rest and slides down from the top of a fixed sphere of
radius R, where R >> size of the block. The surface of the sphere is frictionless and 
constant gravitational acceleration g acts downward. 
(a) [10 pts] Determine the speed of the block as a function of angle from the top 
while it remains in contact with the sphere. 
(b) [10 pts] At what angle does the block lose contact with the sphere?

Quiz 2 

µ 

A rocket of total mass M0, half of which is fuel, starts at rest on a long horizontal 
table.  The coefficient of friction between the rocket and table surfaces is µ.  At 
time t = 0, the rocket is ignited, ejecting fuel out at a constant rate γ = |dM/dt| with 
velocity vex  relative to the rocket.  Constant gravitational acceleration g acts 
downward. 
(a) [10 pts] What condition must be met for the rocket to start moving at t = 0? 
(b) [10 pts] Assuming that the rocket satisfies this requirement, what is the
maximum speed VMAX  achieved by the rocket? 
(c) [5 pts] How far does the rocket go after it runs out of fuel?  You can express 
your answer in terms of VMAX. 
(d) [BONUS 5 pts] How far does the rocket travel in total?  For this you will need 
to make use of the following integral:

Problem 5: Planet Orbit [25 pts] 

A small planet of mass m is in a circular orbit of radius r around a star of mass M
and radius R in otherwise empty space (assume M >> m so the star is stationary). 

(a) [10 pts] Determine the potential energy U(r), the kinetic energy K(r) and the
total mechanical energy E(r) of the planet in terms of G, M and r assuming U→0 
as r→∞. 

(b) [5 pts] Determine the minimum amount of mechanical energy that must be
added to the planet to cause it to escape from the star (i.e., r→∞).  By what factor 
must the speed of the planet be increased to cause it to escape? 

(c) [5 pts] Now assume that the planet in subject to a viscous force of the form 

is the direction of motion.  Compute the loss of
where A is a constant and 
mechanical energy in one orbital period in terms of G, M, r and A. Assume that
this loss is small enough that neither the orbital radius nor speed of the planet 
changes appreciably in one orbit. 

(d) [5 pts] Building from (c), compute the change in radius of the planet in one
orbital period due to the viscous force and the corresponding radial velocity based 
on the assumptions above, in terms of G, M, r and A.  Does the planet fall into the 
star or away from it?
