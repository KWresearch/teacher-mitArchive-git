Problem 1: Quick Multiple Choice Questions [10 pts] 
For each of the following questions circle the correct answer. You do not need to 
show any work. 
(a) Which of the following is not a valid force law? 

where b has units of 
Newtons 

where G is the 
gravitational
force constant 

where b has units of 
kg 

where b has 
units of 
radians 

Both of these solutions are right, the first because it doesn’t satisfy Newton’s 3rd 
Law (switch 1 and 2 and you don’t get equal and opposite), the second because of 
units 

(b) A tire rolls on a flat surface with constant 
angular velocity Ω and velocity 
as shown in the 
diagram to the right.  If V > ΩR, in which direction 
does friction from the road act on the tire? 

Toward the left 

Toward the right 

Friction does not act 
on the tire 
The intention was to have friction spinning the wheel up, but because of the word 
“constant” in the question, we deemed this question to ambiguous so it wasn’t
counted in the final score

Quiz 1 

(c) You pull a brick of mass M sitting on 

a flat table using a thick rope of mass m.

Friction between the surface of the table

and the brick is sufficient so that the brick 

remains at rest.  Compared to the force with which you pull on one end of the rope,

the force that the other end of the rope exerts on the brick is:

Zero 
The same 
Greater 
Less 
There is no net force on the rope (or block), so there cannot be a difference in 
tension along the rope.  Hence the forces are the same at both ends. 

(d) As a swinging pendulum passes through its lowest point, in which direction 
does the total net force act? 

Only in a radial
direction 

Only in an 
angular direction 

There is zero net 
In both angular 
force at the 
and radial 
equilibrium point 
directions 
Because the mass is moving in circular motion, there must be a radial force.  At the 
lowest point there are no net angular forces, however. 

(e) A pendulum with mass M and length L is released as a small angle off of
vertical and oscillates with period P.  If we double the mass and halve the length of 
the pendulum then the new period is 

Doubling the mass does not affect the period but decreasing the length decreases

the period, which is 2π(l/g)^0.5

Problem 2: The Accelerated Atwood Machine [30 pts] 

Two blocks of masses M1  and M2  (M2  > M1) are stacked on top of each other and 
start at rest on the surface of a frictionless table.  The masses are connected via an 
ideal pulley (massless string and nearly massless pulley wheel), and the coefficient
of static friction (assumed equal to the coefficient of kinetic friction) between the 
block surfaces is µS. The pulley is accelerated to the right by a force 
, resulting 
in an acceleration of the pulley wheel of 
.  Assume that gravity acts with 
constant acceleration g downward. 
(a) [5 pts] Draw force diagrams for each of the blocks and the pulley wheel, clearly 
indicating all horizontal and vertical forces acting on them. 
(b) [5 pts] If the blocks do not slip relative to each other, what are their
accelerations? 
(c) [10 pts] Assume that the blocks do slip relative to each other.  Determine each 
block’s horizontal acceleration as a function of the parameters specified above
(i.e., M1, M2, µS, g, a and F).  Which block has a higher acceleration?  Be sure to 
work in an inertial reference frame! 
(d) [10 pts] What is the minimum force F required to cause one block to slip 
relative to the other?  Assume that the mass of the pulley is negligible compared to 
those of the blocks.

Quiz 1 

(a) The force diagrams are as shown below – note that the weight of the pulley is
specifically excluded here and the string tension assumed to be constant because
the string is massless (no points were taken off for not assuming these things).
Common errors were not matching up force pairs; i.e., Ff  (crucial!) and N1 

Note that the direction of the friction force takes some thought, but can be
determined if one considers the problem without friction.  In that case the smaller
mass M1  would move to the right faster (same tension force but smaller mass);
hence, friction acts to stop that relative motion by acting toward the left on M1. 
Newton’s 3rd  law then states that the same friction force acts toward the right on 
M2. 
(b) If the blocks do not slip, then their accelerations are exactly equal to that of the
pulley, a.  This can be shown formally through the constraint equation: 

and the condition 

Because F is also specified, one can also determine solve for the equations of
motion assuming that the two accelerations are the same and equally determine:

Quiz 1 

although care must be taken here since µ ≤ µS. 

(c) Based on the force diagram above, the equations of motion are: 

Because the pulley is effectively massless, MPaP  ≈ 0 and hence F = 2T.  This alone 
provides expressions for the two pulleys: 

We can also solve for the rope tension using the constrain equation: 

substituting back in one can derive

A third pair of valid expressions (in terms of F and a) are

. 

(d) There are number of ways to consider this problem, but the most obvious is to 
consider the point at which 
(prior the slipping both masses are 
accelerating with a).  This yields any of the following conditions based on the 
answers to part (c):

Problem 3: Hanging Rope [20 pts] 

Consider a rope of total mass M and length L suspended at rest from a fixed 
mount.  The rope has a linear mass density that varies with height as λ(z) = 
λ0sin(πz/L) where λ0  is a constant.  Constant gravitational acceleration g acts 
downward. 
(a) [5 pts] Determine the constant λ0. 
(b) [5 pts] What is the tension force at the free (bottom) end of the rope? 
(c) [10 pts] Calculate the tension along the rope as a function of distance z below
the mount. 

Page 8 of 15 

8.012 Fall 2008 

Quiz 1 

(a) The constant can be found by noting that the integral of the linear density over 
the length of the rope should equal the mass; i.e., 

(b) Because there is nothing hanging from the bottom end, the tension force is
simply 0. 

(c) There are two ways of determining this. First, you can consider that the tension 
at any height z is simply that required to hold up the mass below z; i.e., 

Alternately, one can set up a differential equation at any height z requiring that the
difference in tensions must support the differential mass at that point (note that z 
increases downward); i.e., 

which reduces to the same result.  Note that here we have used the result from (b) 
that T(L) = 0.

Problem 4: Don’t Slip! [20 pts] 

M 

r 

µ 

An 8.012 student of mass M stands on a rigid disk at a distance r from the center
axis.  Assume that the coefficient of friction between the student’s shoes and the 
disk surface is µ.  At time t = 0, the disk begins to rotate with a constant angular 
acceleration rate 
.  Assume that gravity acts with constant acceleration g 
downward. 
(a) [5 pts] What is the maximum value of angular acceleration rate (αmax) such that 
the student does not immediately slip? 
(b) [10 pts] Assuming that α < αmax, what is the total friction force acting on the
student as a function of time (prior to slipping)?  Write your answer as a vector in 
polar coordinates. 
(c) [5 pts] Assuming that α < αmax, how long after the disk starts rotating will the 
student slip?

Quiz 1 

(a) Recall that the force acting on the student in polar coordinates is expressed as: 

at t=0, 

, so the force expression reduces to: 

we want the case where the student doesn’t slip, so 

(b) Now we have to explicitly consider the angular rate as a function of time, 
although note that the radius does not change so 
while 
.  Then 

(c) Again we want to satisfy the condition:

Problem 5: Will the LHC Destroy the World? [20 pts] 

There has been some speculation that the Large Hadron Collider (or LHC), a
particle accelerator experiment that will smash protons together at incredible 
energies, might create a small black hole that could devour the Earth.  Let’s
imagine that the LHC does create such a black hole of mass M (assume initially 
than M << MEartg).  Once it has formed (initially at rest), the black hole will 
immediately fall under the influence of gravity toward the center of the Earth.
Assume for this problem that the Earth has a constant volume mass density ρ, and 
that the black hole doesn’t eat that much of the Earth as it passes through it. 
(a) [5 pts] Using dimensional analysis, come up with an order-of-magnitude
expression for the oscillation period of the black hole as it passes through the Earth 
based on the relevant parameters of this problem. 
(b) [10 pts] Now show that the black hole undergoes simple harmonic motion 
(similar to spring motion) by determining its acceleration as a function of time, and 
derive an expression for the oscillation period.  How does this compare with your
answer in part (a)? 
(c) [5 pts] The Earth does not have a constant mass density but rather gets denser 
closer to its center.  Assuming that it is still spherically symmetric, would this fact
cause the oscillation period of the black hole to be shorter or longer?  Justify your 
answer. 
(d) [10 pts BONUS] Assume that the particle collision that creates the black hole 
converts the equivalent of an entire year’s worth of global energy production 
(about 5x1020  Newton-meters) into a single black hole at rest.  Also, the radius of a 
black hole is the distance at which the gravitational escape velocity exceeds the 
speed of light.  Based on these assumptions, use dimensional analysis to estimate
the mass and radius of the black hole to within an order of magnitude.  Based on 
these values, should we worry about an LHC black hole?  Some important 
numbers for this question are the gravitational constant, G ≈ 7x10-11  m3  kg-1s-2; the 
speed of light, c ≈ 3x108  m/s; and, for comparison, the radius of a proton, rproton  ≈ 
10-15  m, and the radius of the Earth, REarth  ≈ 6x106  m.

Quiz 1 

(a) The important parameters are the mass of the Earth (ME  ~ [M]), the radius of 
the Earth (RE  ~ [L]), the density of the Earth (ρ ~ [M/L3]) and the gravitational 
constant (G ~ [L3T-2M-1]).  Note that the mass of the black hole shouldn’t matter 
based on our knowledge of the gravitational force law (i.e., we are looking for an 
aceeleration, which is independent of black hole mass).  We are seeking a period ~ 
[T], and the combinations that work are: 

3  are degenerate with each other, hence either expression is 

However, ρ and Me/Re
viable. 
(b) We want to compute the force on the black hole as a function of radius from the
center of the Earth using two important gravitational results: (1) the gravitational
force outside a spherical symmetric mass is equivalent to the force from a point 
mass and (2) inside a spherically symmetric shell an object feels no net
gravitational force.  Hence the black hole is only pulled in by the fraction of the
Earth’s mass that is interior to its radial position: 

where 

which has the form of a simple harmonic oscillator with period

Quiz 1 

(c) The period will generally be shorter since the force (and hence acceleration) on 
the black hole will be greater at a given radius as there is more total mass within 
that radius.  In the extreme case of a infinitesimal shell of mass the period can 
become very long as the BH will experience no acceleration past the thin shell (and 
that acceleration will be the same as the case of a constant density ball). 
(d) For the black hole mass we can use Einstein’s equation to relate energy to mass 
(an approximation to be sure), so m ≈ E/c^2 ≈ 5x1020  N-m/(9x1016  m2/s2) ≈ 5000 
kg, or about 5 tons. 
For the radius, the relevant quantities are the black hole mass ([M]), G ([L3T-2M-1]) 
and c ([L2/T2]), which can be combined as 

to give a quantity that has dimension length.  With the values given, this gives a 
radius of roughly 5x10-24  m – about 9 orders of magnitude smaller than a proton! 
So I won’t worry…
