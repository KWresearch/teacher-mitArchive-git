Problem 1: Masses and Rod [15 pts] 

A block with mass 3M connected to a massless rod of length L lies at rest on a
fixed frictionless table.  A second block of mass M impinges on the system with 
speed v0, strikes the opposite end of the rod at a right angle, and sticks.  For this 
problem, assume that the dimensions of the blocks are much smaller than the
length of the rod. 
(a) [5 pts] What is the final velocity of the center of mass of the block-rod-block
system? 
(b) [5 pts] What is the final angular velocity of the block-rod-block system about
its center of mass? 
(d) [3 pts] What is the initial velocity of the more massive block after the collision?
Be sure to indicate its direction and speed.

SOLUTIONS 

(a) Linear momentum of system is conserved (no external forces), so 

(b) Angular momentum of system is conserved (no external torques) so 

where 

is the distance from the center of mass (COM) to the end of the bar: 

and I is the moment of inertia of two point masses about the COM:

Problem 2: An Unusual Force Law [15 pts] 
Consider the following force law: 

for x > 0 , where m is the mass of the object, 
is a constant length and c is the
speed of light (Note: this force is related to the motion of a mass near a black hole). 
(a) [5 pts] Sketch the potential energy of this force law as a function of x.  What 
are the two finite equilibrium points for this force law (i.e., excluding 
)?
Which of these is stable? 
(b) [5 pts] Compute the period of small oscillations about the stable equilibrium
point. 
(c) [5 pts] An object of mass m, initially at rest at the unstable equilibrium point,
moves toward the stable equilibrium point.  What is its velocity at the stable
equilibrium point?

(a) First calculate potential energy: 

Now calculate the equilibrium points, where 

: 

(ignoring 

solution) 

so 
limits for x: 

are the finite equilibrium points. We can evaluate these points and the

By inspection, we can see that x=a is unstable and x=3a is stable.  We can also 
determine this from the second derivative of U: 

so x=3a is stable. 

(b) The effective spring constant about the stability point is 

The period of small oscillations is therefore: 

(c) At x = a, the total mechanical energy is 

At x = 3a, 

As this is a conservative force, total mechanical energy is conserved, so

Problem 3: Particle Collision [30 pts] 

A particle of mass m and velocity 
collides with a particle of mass 3m at
rest in the LAB frame.  The ensuing interaction creates two particles with identical 
masses 2m that scatter off with velocities 
and 
at angles 
and 
from the
 axis, respectively, in the LAB frame.  A mechanical energy Q is lost as a result
of the interaction.  Assume that there are no external forces at work. 

(a) [10 pts] What is the minimum kinetic energy (K0) of the incident particle
required for this interaction to take place? 

(b) [10 pts] Assume that the incident particle has initial kinetic energy K =  K0 
where 
> 1.  Write an expression relating the scattering angle 
in the LAB 
frame to the center of mass scattering angle 
(the deflection angle of the particles
in the center of mass frame) that depends only on 
. 
(c) [10 pts] One of the scattered particles is observed to emerge at an angle of 90º
with respect to the 
axis in the LAB frame. In the limit that the kinetic energy of
the incident particle is much larger than the minimum energy (i.e., 
>> 1), what 
is the maximum interaction scattering angle 
for which this could occur?  Note: 
this can be solved without doing part (b).

SOLUTIONS


(a) The minimum initial 
(in the LAB frame) occurs when the emergent
      
particles have zero velocity in the COM frame, or when they are moving together
in the LAB frame.  So there are two ways to calculate this.  First, move to COM
frame:

 and 
In both the LAB or COM frame, since there are no external forces: 

where the prime variables refer to after the collision.  Note that this equation only
works when we compare energies in the same frame!  If the emergent particles
have no velocity in COM frame, then 

then the minimum kinetic energy of the first particle in the LAB frame is 

We can also solve this entirely in the LAB frame by noting that if the emergent 
particles are at rest in the COM frame, they most both have velocity 
in 
the LAB frame; hence:

(b) Assume: 

 Quiz 2 

In the COM frame, the emergent particles scatter with velocities 
Since the total linear momentum in the COM frame is 0, 

and 

. 

and hence the magnitudes are: 

Conservation of energy in the COM frame gives: 

If the particles scatter with angle 

in the COM frame, then 

Moving back to LAB frame, the velocities of the scattered particles are just the 
COM velocities 
: 

The angle 

in the LAB frame can be then found as: 

where

(c) For 

, 

For particle 1 to be scattered off at 90º, this requires 

This is the maximum COM scattering angle for any one of the particles to scatter
through 90º in the LAB frame, since it requires  > 90º. If the second particle 
scatters through 90º in the LAB frame: 

which allows for  < 90º (assuming 
≤ 180º). 
An alternative derivation that doesn’t require a solution from part (b) is as follows:
Assuming that particle 1 scatters through 90º in the LAB frame, then 

if 

, then K >> Q, so in the COM frame: 

and hence

 Quiz 2 

A uniform hoop with mass M, outer radius R and inner radius R/2 is initially 
spinning with angular velocity 
0.  The hoop is placed onto a uniform disk, also
of mass M and outer radius R, that is initially at rest on a fixed frictionless table.
The hoop and disk are aligned along their centers of mass.  There is a coefficient of 
friction 
between the hoop and disk where their surfaces make contact.
Gravitational acceleration is assumed to be constant and points downward. 

(a) [10 pts] What is the initial torque (about its center of mass) acting on the disk?
What is the initial torque (about its center of mass) acting on the hoop? 
(b) [5 pts] The friction force between the hoop and disk cause them to eventually
spin at the same angular velocity.  What is this angular velocity? 
(c) [5 pts] How much time does it take for the disk and hoop to reach this common
angular velocity?

, where
(a) The torque on the hoop from the disk arises from friction 
 is the normal contact force between the disk and hoop. First consider a
small section where the hoop and disk make contact. 

where 
areal density 

is a small mass segment on the hoop with uniform
The total torque is an integral over the area of the loop: 

. 

but the mass of the hoop is: 

Hence the torque on the hoop as the result of frictional forces from the disk is 

Following Newton’s third law, the frictional force on the disk from the hoop is
equal and opposite to that of the hoop from the disk, and the force acts over the
same surface area.  Hence, the torques are equal and opposite:

 Quiz 2 

(b) There are no external torques on the disk/hoop system, so total angular
momentum is conserved, i.e., 

The moment of inertia of the hoop is: 

while 

Hence, 

(c) The time it takes for the hoop to spin down is given by the torque: 

setting 

to the value from part (b) gives: 

as a check we can compute the speed up time for the disk:

again, substituting the value from part (b) gives:

Problem 5: Spring-loaded Tube [20 pts] 

A block of mass M and velocity v0 is moving through a fixed tube with frictionless
walls.  At the bottom of a loop of radius R, the block collides perfectly inelastically
(i.e., it sticks) with a plunger of mass M connected to a long fixed spring with
spring constant k and equilibrium length πR.  As the plunger and block travel 
around the loop, they are also acted on by a drag force 
; i.e., a force
that acts opposite to the direction of motion.  Gravitational acceleration acts 
downward.  Assume that the dimensions of the block and plunger are much smaller
than R, so that their rotation about their centers of mass are negligible. 
(a) [10 pts] What is the incoming block’s velocity if the plunger and block come to
rest at  = π/2? 
(b) [10 pts] Continuing from (a), after the block/plunger pair stop at  = π/2, they
swing back around the loop and out into the straight, frictionless linear tube.  If 
there are no adhesive forces that keep the block and plunger bound to each other, at
what point does the block move away from the plunger and with what speed?

(a) The initial collision conserves momentum (no external forces acting in short
collision period), hence, 

The initial total mechanical energy is then 

(Assuming U = 0 at the bottom of the loop).  At an arbitrary angle 
down the total mechanical energy as: 

, we can write

where U is the potential energy and W the nonconservative work done on the
objects.  The potential energy arises from gravitational and spring forces: 

The work is done by the drag force: 

At  = π/2, the kinetic energy is: 

if the object is at rest at this point, then 

(b) The block and plunger separate at the bottom of the loop, for at this point the
plunger will be pulled back by the spring while the block can move on at the speed

of both objects at that point.  At the bottom of the tube, U = 0 and the total
mechanical energy lost is simply twice the work done by the drag force on the way
up:
