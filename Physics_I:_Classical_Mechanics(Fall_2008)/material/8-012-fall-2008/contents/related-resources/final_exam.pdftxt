1.  Problem  1  of  7 
Sliding  a  crate.   (15  points)


A  mover  is   trying  to  slide   a  uniformly  ﬁlled  crate  of  length  L and  height  H across  the  ﬂoor. 

There  is   friction  with   coeﬃcient  µ between  the  crate  and  the   ﬂoor.  The  mover  exerts  a

horizontal  force  F at  the  upper   back edge   of the   crate. If  µ > µ0 ,  the   crate  will tip over  before

it  slides.   Calculate  the  critical  friction  coeﬃcient   µ0 .  Gravity  is  directed  downward.


2.  Problem  2  of  7 
Reel  of  tape  on  a  frictionless  surface.  (15  points) 

A  long   length   of  tape   is  wrapped   around  a  reel  which  is  at  rest  on  a  frictionless   surface.  The  
tape  itself  has  negligible  mass,  but   the  reel  has  mass  M ,  radius   R,  and  moment  of  inertia  I0 
about  its   center.  The   end  of  the   tape  is  pulled  horizontally  with  a  constant  force  F ,  as  shown 
in  the  ﬁgure.  Calculate   x,  the  horizontal  displacement  of  the   reel  from  its  initial  position 
when  a  length  s  of tape  has  unwound  from  the   reel. 

3.  Problem  3  of  7 
Falling  rod.  (15  points) 

A  uniform   rod  of  length  L  and  mass   M  is   free  to  rotate   about  a  pivot  at  its  lower  end.  An 
attached   bead   of   negligible  mass  is  free  to  move  without  friction  along  the  rod,  but   a   massless 
collar  ﬁxed   on  the  rod   at  a  distance   h  from  the   pivot  requires  the  bead’s  distance  from  the 
pivot  to  be  ≥  h.  Initially,  the  rod  is   at   rest  and  nearly  vertical,  and  the  bead  is  resting  on 
the  collar.  The  rod   is  then  released  and  falls  over.  Compute  the  angle   θ  from  the  vertical 
at  which  the   bead  loses  contact  with  the  collar. (You  should  give  the  full  expression  for  any  
moment   of  inertia  in   your  answer.)   Gravity  is  directed  downward. 

4.  Problem  4  of  7 
Compound  gyroscope.  (15  points) 

A  compound  gyroscope   consists  of  four   identical  ﬂywheels  mounted  at  the  midpoints  of  the 
edges  of  a  rigid  square  frame  of  length  L.  Each  ﬂywheel  has  moment  of  inertia  I0  and  is 
spinning  rapidly   at  the  same  angular  velocity  ω ,  with  the   sense   of  rotation  shown  in  the  
ﬁgure.  The  entire  assembly  (frame  plus  ﬂywheels)  has   total  mass  M ,  and  the  center  of  mass 
is  at   the  geometric  center   of  the   square  frame.  One   corner  of  the   frame  is  attached  to   a 
frictionless  pivot,  so  that  the  entire  frame  is  free  to  rotate  about  the  pivot  in  any   direction. 
In  the  top-view  ﬁgure,  gravity is  directed  into  the  page. 

(a)  (10  points) Find the   frequency  of  uniform  precession  Ω  and  indicate  its  direction. 

(b)   (5  points)  Now  suppose  the  entire   compound  gyroscope  is   placed  inside  an  elevator. The  
elevator   accelerates   upward   (opposite   to  gravity,  so  out   of  the  page  in  the  ﬁgure)  with 
uniform  acceleration  A.  Find  the  new  frequency  of  uniform  precession. 

5.  Problem  5  of  7 
Particle  in  a  central  force  ﬁeld.  (15  points)


A mass  m  moves  under  the  inﬂuence  of an  attractive   central  force  Ar4  with angular  momentum

L,  where  A  and  L  are  positive  constants.  Deﬁne   the   potential  energy  to  be  zero  at  the  origin.

For  what  total energy will the   motion  be  circular,  and what  is  the  radius  of this   circular  orbit?


6.  Problem  6  of  7 
Colliding  blocks.   (10  points)


A  mass  M1  is  sliding  with   velocity  v0  along  a   frictionless   table  toward  three  masses  M2 ,  M3 ,

and  M4  which   are  sitting  at  rest   in  the  path  of  M1 ,  as  shown.  The  masses  get   successively

much  smaller,  so  that


M4  � M3  � M2  � M1 ,

where  the  symbol  “ � ”  means   “much  smaller  than”.  What  is  the  velocity  of  mass  M4  after

all   the  collisions   have  happened?  Assume  that   all  the  collisions  are  perfectly   elastic.


Hint:  This   problem   is   easiest   if  you  consider  each  collision  individually  and  make   a   judicious

choice  for  the  coordinate  frame  each  time.


7.  Problem  7  of  7 
Pro jectile  near  two  gravitating  spheres.  (15  points) 

Two  identical  spheres  of  mass  M  and  radius  R  are  held  ﬁxed  at  a  separation  distance  D ,  as 
shown.   A  small  pro jectile  of  mass  m  is   ﬁred  with  initial  velocity  v0  from  the   surface   of  one 
sphere  directly  toward   the   other. What  is  the  minimum  value  of  v0  such that  the  pro jectile   just 
reaches  the  second   sphere?   You   should  assume  that  the  pro jectile  is  attracted  gravitationally  
by  each   sphere,  and   that  no   other  forces  are  acting.
