The hoop is placed onto a uniform disk, alsoof mass M and outer radius R, that is initially at rest on a fixed frictionless table.The hoop and disk are aligned along their centers of mass.  There is a coefficient offriction  between the hoop and disk where their surfaces make contact.Gravitational acceleration is assumed to be constant and points downward.(a) [10 pts] What is the initial torque (about its center of mass) acting on the disk?What is the initial torque (about its center of mass) acting on the hoop?(b) [5 pts] The friction force between the hoop and disk cause them to eventuallyspin at the same angular velocity.  What is this angular velocity?(c) [5 pts] How much time does it take for the disk and hoop to reach this commonangular velocity?8.012 Fall 2006   Quiz 2Page 12 of 17SOLUTIONS(a) The torque on the hoop from the disk arises from friction , where is the normal contact force between the disk and hoop. First consider asmall section where the hoop and disk make contact. where is a small mass segment on the hoop with uniformareal density .  The total torque is an integral over the area of the loop: but the mass of the hoop is:Hence the torque on the hoop as the result of frictional forces from the disk isFollowing Newton’s third law, the frictional force on the disk from the hoop isequal and opposite to that of the hoop from the disk, and the force acts over thesame surface area.  Hence, the torques are equal and opposite:8.012 Fall 2006   Quiz 2Page 13 of 17(b) There are no external torques on the disk/hoop system, so total angularmomentum is conserved, i.e.,The moment of inertia of the hoop is:whileHence,(c) The time it takes for the hoop to spin down is given by the torque:setting  to the value from part (b) gives:as a check we can compute the speed up time for the disk:8.012 Fall 2006   Quiz 2Page 14 of 17again, substituting the value from part (b) gives:8.012 Fall 2006   Final ExamPage 21 of 28Problem 7: Spinning Bouncing Ball [15 pts]A uniform sphere of mass M and radius R spinning with angular velocity ! isdropped from a height H.  It bounces on the floor and recoils with the same verticalvelocity.  During the bounce, the surface of the ball slips relative to the surface ofthe floor (i.e., it does not roll) and in the process the ball is acted upon by a frictionforce with magnitude ƒ = µN, where N is the normal contact force between the balland the floor and µ is a constant. Hence, the ball experiences impulses in bothvertical and horizontal directions. Assume that the duration of contact, "t, is veryshort.(a) What angle # with respect to vertical does the ball recoil?(b) What is the final rotation velocity of the ball?(c) What value of H results in the ball bouncing off with no spin?8.012 Fall 2006   Final ExamPage 22 of 28(a) The angle # is related to the horizontal and vertical components of the ball’svelocity after the bounce.  The vertical component is straightforward, as it is statedin the problem that it rebounds with the same velocity as it struck the ground,which is:The horizontal component arise from the impulse due to friction acting at thecontact surface:This is related to the vertical impulse by:Hence:and:(b) The frictional force produces a torque that acts in the opposite direction as thespinning of the ball. This torque exerts a rotational impulse (change in angularmomentum):Hence,Using the momentum of inertia for a sphere:8.012 Fall 2006   Final ExamPage 23 of 28yields(c) For no spin after the bounce, ! = 0, so8.012 Fall 2006   Final ExamPage 6 of 28Problem 2: The Double Gyroscope [15 pts]A gyroscope consists of two identical uniform disks with mass M and radius Rmounted on a rigid axle with length 2D.  The axle is fixed to the outer disk, whilethe inner disk is allowed to spin freely but is constrained to remain at a distance Dfrom the pivot (at left) by a collar.  The axle spins about the pivot freely on africtionless mount.  The outer disk and axle are initially spun up to an angularfrequency !0.  Assume that the mass of the axle and pivot mount are negligible.Gravity points downward.  Ignore nutation.(a) Calculate the precession rate ! of the gyroscope assuming that the inner disk isnot spinning.  Assume that !0 is very large and the gyroscopic approximationapplies.(b) Friction between the axle and the disk closest to the pivot causes the latter tospin up.  Assuming that a constant torque " acts at the interface between the axleand inner hole of this disk, calculate the final spin rate ! of both disks and the finalprecession rate in terms of the initial precession rate.(c) How much energy is lost from the gyroscope system during the spinning up ofthe inner disk?8.012 Fall 2006   Final ExamPage 7 of 28(a) The net torque on the gyroscope with respect to the pivot point isThe gyroscope approximation is:The angular momentum of the first disk isHence(b) The constant frictional torque isHence:This is the result of the force from the axle acting on the inner wheel; Newton’sthird law tells us that an equal and opposite force acts on the axle + outer wheeland slows it down.  HenceThe frictional force ceases when the surfaces do not slide relative to one another,i.e., when , so8.012 Fall 2006   Final ExamPage 8 of 28To calculate the precession, note that the torque hasn’t changed, while themagnitude of the angular momentum vector isand is therefore also unchanged.  So the precession rate is the same:(c) Only the rotational kinetic energy of the system changes as a result of the innerwheel spinning up.  The initial rotational kinetic energy iswhere is the moment of inertia of the entire gyroscope rotating about the pivot.The final rotational kinetic energy isHence the total energy lost is:8.012 Fall 2007     Quiz 2 Page 5 of 21 Problem 2: The Bowling Ball [25 pts]    A bowling ball of radius R, mass M and uniform mass density is thrown down a lane with initial horizontal speed v0.  The ball is given some backspin – it is spun in the opposite direction of motion – with initial angular rate !0 as shown.  The maximum coefficient of friction between the ball and lane surfaces is µ.  Assume constant gravitational acceleration    points downward.  (a) [10 pts] Find the velocity and angular rotation rate ! of the ball as a function of time after it makes contact with the lane, and up to the point when it starts to roll without slipping.  Note: directions are important here!  (b) [10 pts] Find the “final” velocity and angular rotation rate of the ball when it starts to roll without slipping.  (c) [5 pts] How must the initial conditions, v0 and !0, be related for the ball to come to rest?     8.012 Fall 2007     Quiz 2 Page 6 of 21 Solutions   (a) This problem can solved by considering the translation of the center  of mass and rotation about the center of mass of the ball separately.  Referring to the force diagram to the right, the equations of motion are:        Note that torque is working to slow down the rotation of the ball in this case, so there must be a minus sign in the angle equation if we set !0 > 0.  A ball is a sphere, so    While the ball is slipping, the friction force is at its maximum (constant) value of Ff =  µN = µMg, so the equations are easily solved. Using the initial conditions:    8.012 Fall 2007     Quiz 2 Page 7 of 21  we find (note the specific direction of velocity):     (b) The condition of rolling without slipping occurs when  Note the minus sign – this is because we defined positive rotation in the initial conditions such that the object has backspin, but when it is not slipping it must have forward spin.  This condition can be used to find the time tf when the ball starts to roll without slipping:      Plugging this back into the expressions from (a) we find:     Note that after this point, the friction force ceases to act as the surfaces are no longer slipping relative to each other, and so the ball continues to roll/spin at these rates.  8.012 Fall 2007     Quiz 2 Page 8 of 21 (c) The object comes to rest when its final velocity goes to 0.  From the expression from (b) we find that this occurs if:    8.012 Fall 2007     Quiz 2 Page 13 of 21 Problem 4: A Ballistic Rotator [20 pts]                     A thin arrow with length R, mass m and uniform linear mass density ! = M/R is shot with velocity v into a circular target of radius R, mass M, uniform surface mass density " = M/!R2, and negligible thickness (i.e., it is essentially a thin disk).  The arrow head sticks into the target just off center by a distance x < R as shown above.  The target is mounted onto a central frictionless shaft, about which it can spin freely.  The target is at rest before it is struck by the arrow.  (a) [10 pts] Find the angular rotation rate of the target (with arrow embedded) after the arrow strikes it. You can express you answer in terms of IT, the moment of inertia of the circular target alone about the rotation axis shown.    (b) [5 pts] Show that if m << M then to first order the rotation rate depends linearly on both x and v.  (c) [5 pts] Derive an expression for IT in terms of M and R. Warning! This is a difficult problem, so save it for last! 8.012 Fall 2007     Quiz 2 Page 14 of 21 Solution   (a) The arrow hitting the target is an example of an inelastic collision, since the arrow does not rebound off of the target.  Hence energy s not conserved.  Translational momentum is also not conserved, as the vertical shaft provides an impulse to prevent the target from moving.  However, none of these forces present exert a torque on the arrow-target system during the collision (we can ignore gravity since it acts to slowly), so angular momentum is conserved.  Let’s measure angular momentum from the center of mass of the target.  Then the angular momentum prior to the collision arises solely from the translational motion of the arrow relative to this point, i.e.,     where  points downward.  After the collision all of the angular momentum is in rotation of the target and arrow about the shaft    (the direction of angular rotation should be such that L points downward) . The moment of inertia of the arrow can be found by successive applications of the parallax axis theorem, shifting from the center of mass of the arrow to its end, and then shifting from where the arrow sticks into the target to the rotation axis.  Putting this together:    So the angular rotation rate is:  8.012 Fall 2007     Quiz 2 Page 15 of 21    (b) It " MR2, Iarrow " mR2 + mx2  so if m << M, then It >> Iarrow, and the solution to (a) reduces to:    This depends linearly on both v and x, since It depends on neither of these quanitites.  (c) There are a number of ways of solving this, including using a fun trick the TA demonstrated in the review session.  However, the most direct way is to use the standard integral expression for I:    where the factors in the integral, in polar coordinates, are:        The volume integral is then:  8.012 Fall 2007     Quiz 2 Page 16 of 21     The integral over # can be computed by substituting the appropriate half-angle trig identity; an easier trick is to note that over 2! the integrals of cos2 and sin2 are the same (in both cases they are over a full period).  Hence:      so
