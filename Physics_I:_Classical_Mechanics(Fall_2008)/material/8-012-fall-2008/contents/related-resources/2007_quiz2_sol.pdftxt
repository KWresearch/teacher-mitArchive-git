Quiz 2 

Problem 1: Quick Multiple Choice Questions [10 pts] 
Answer all five problems. You do not need to show any work. Do not spend a 
long time on this section. 

(a) What are the dimensions of the universal gravitational constant G? Recall that
[M] = mass, [L] = length and [T] = time 
[M][L]2[T]-1

diameter R cut out of it.  The hole lies between the outer 
edge of the disk and the center of the disk, as shown to the

Quiz 2 

Problem 2: The Bowling Ball [25 pts] 

A bowling ball of radius R, mass M and uniform mass density is thrown down a 
lane with initial horizontal speed v0.  The ball is given some backspin – it is spun in 
the opposite direction of motion – with initial angular rate ω0  as shown.  The 
maximum coefficient of friction between the ball and lane surfaces is µ.  Assume 
constant gravitational acceleration  points downward. 
(a) [10 pts] Find the velocity 
and angular rotation rate ω of the ball as a function 
of time after it makes contact with the lane, and up to the point when it starts to roll
without slipping.  Note: directions are important here! 
(b) [10 pts] Find the “final” velocity and angular rotation rate of the ball when it
starts to roll without slipping. 
(c) [5 pts] How must the initial conditions, v0  and ω0, be related for the ball to 
come to rest?

Solutions 

(a) This problem can solved by 
considering the translation of the
center  of mass and rotation about 
the center of mass of the ball 
separately.  Referring to the force
diagram to the right, the equations
of motion are: 

Note that torque is working to slow down the rotation of the ball in this
case, so there must be a minus sign in the angle equation if we set ω0  > 0. 
A ball is a sphere, so 

While the ball is slipping, the friction force is at its maximum (constant) 
value of Ff  =  µN = µMg, so the equations are easily solved. Using the
initial conditions:

Quiz 2 

we find (note the specific direction of velocity): 

(b) The condition of rolling without slipping occurs when 

Note the minus sign – this is because we defined positive rotation in the 
initial conditions such that the object has backspin, but when it is not
slipping it must have forward spin.  This condition can be used to find 
the time tf  when the ball starts to roll without slipping: 

Plugging this back into the expressions from (a) we find:


Note that after this point, the friction force ceases to act as the surfaces
are no longer slipping relative to each other, and so the ball continues to 
roll/spin at these rates.

Quiz 2 

(c) The object comes to rest when its final velocity goes to 0.  From the
expression from (b) we find that this occurs if:

Problem 3: A Generic Potential [25 pts] 
Consider the following one-dimensional potential in which an object of mass m 
moves freely: 

where 
is a constant with dimensions of energy and s = x/x0 is a normalized 
dimension of length. 
(a) [5 pts] Sketch this potential as a function of x in the range -3x0  < x < 3xo. 
(b) [5 pts] Derive values for the equilibrium points and determine which of these
are stable. 
(c) [5 pts] Determine the period of small oscillations about the stable equilibrium
point. 
(d) [5 pts] If the mass starts from x = -∞ and moves toward positive x, what is the
minimum total mechanical energy it needs to reach the stable equilibrium point?
What is its velocity at the stable equilibrium point in this case? 
(e) [5 pts] What is the magnitude and direction of the force acting on the mass
when it is at x = 2xo?

Solution 

(a) A sketch of the potential is shown below: 

Quiz 2 

(b) At the equilibrium points the net force goes to zero, hence

Quiz 2 

The stable equilibrium points satisfy 


By inspection of the sketch, it should be clear that x=x0  (s=1) is  the 
stable equilibrium point.  Formally: 

for s=1, which is > 0 for U0  > 0. 
(c) Period of small oscillation about the stable equilibrium point is: 

where


from (b) we find that:

Quiz 2 

(d) Moving from x = -∞, the mass must make it over the unstable
equilibrium point at x=0, which has potential energy U(0) = -4U0. 
Hence 

The total mechanical energy remains constant, so the loss in potential
energy, U(x0) – U(0) where U(x0) = -5U0, goes into kinetic energy.  If 
the mass has effectively zero kinetic energy at x = 0, then 

(e) Using the expression for F from part (a) and setting x = 2x0  we find: 

The force must point toward negative x, since the potential barrier is

increasing here.

Problem 4: A Ballistic Rotator [20 pts] 

A thin arrow with length R, mass m and uniform linear mass density λ = M/R is
shot with velocity v into a circular target of radius R, mass M, uniform surface
mass density σ = M/πR2, and negligible thickness (i.e., it is essentially a thin disk).
The arrow head sticks into the target just off center by a distance x < R as shown 
above.  The target is mounted onto a central frictionless shaft, about which it can 
spin freely.  The target is at rest before it is struck by the arrow. 
(a) [10 pts] Find the angular rotation rate of the target (with arrow embedded) after
the arrow strikes it. You can express you answer in terms of IT, the moment of 
inertia of the circular target alone about the rotation axis shown. 
(b) [5 pts] Show that if m << M then to first order the rotation rate depends linearly 
on both x and v. 
(c) [5 pts] Derive an expression for IT  in terms of M and R. Warning! This is a 
difficult problem, so save it for last!

Solution 

Quiz 2 

(a) The arrow hitting the target is an example of an inelastic collision,
since the arrow does not rebound off of the target.  Hence energy s not
conserved.  Translational momentum is also not conserved, as the
vertical shaft provides an impulse to prevent the target from moving.
However, none of these forces present exert a torque on the arrow-target 
system during the collision (we can ignore gravity since it acts to 
slowly), so angular momentum is conserved.  Let’s measure angular 
momentum from the center of mass of the target.  Then the angular 
momentum prior to the collision arises solely from the translational
motion of the arrow relative to this point, i.e., 

where 
points downward.  After the collision all of the angular 
momentum is in rotation of the target and arrow about the shaft


(the direction of angular rotation should be such that L points
downward) . The moment of inertia of the arrow can be found by 
successive applications of the parallax axis theorem, shifting from the 
center of mass of the arrow  to its end, and then shifting from where the
arrow sticks into the target to the rotation axis.  Putting this together: 

So the angular rotation rate is:

8.012 Fall 2007 

Quiz 2 

(b) It  ≈ MR2, Iarrow  ≈ mR2  + mx2  so if m << M, then It  >> Iarrow, and the 
solution to (a) reduces to: 

This depends linearly on both v and x, since It  depends on neither of 
these quanitites. 
(c) There are a number of ways of solving this, including using a fun 
trick the TA demonstrated in the review session.  However, the most
direct way is to use the standard integral expression for I: 

where the factors in the integral, in polar coordinates, are:


The volume integral is then:

Quiz 2 

The integral over θ can be computed by substituting the appropriate 
half-angle trig identity; an easier trick is to note that over 2π the 
integrals of cos2  and sin2  are the same (in both cases they are over a full 
period).  Hence: 

so

Problem 5: The Continuous Multi-stage Rocket [20 pts] 

Consider a rocket of total mass 3M divided equally into payload (at top), rocket
shell, and fuel.  The rocket, initially at rest, ejects its fuel at a constant mass loss 
rate 
and with constant velocity 
relative to the rocket.  However,
for each bit of fuel ejected, the rocket also sheds part of its shell, with the same
mass loss rate as the fuel but with zero velocity relative to the rocket. 
(a) [10 pts] Derive the equation of motion for this rocket, assuming it is moving in 
free space (i.e,. there are no external forces).  Note: this is not necessary going to 
be the same as the standard rocket equation we learned in lecture. 
(b) [10 pts] Determine the final speed of the payload after the fuel and shell are
ejected in terms of M, u and 
.

Solution 

Quiz 2 

(a) Let’s simply the notation by letting 3M0  be the initial mass of the 
rocket.  As there are no external forces, we can apply conservation of 
momentum when each small piece of fuel is ejected/part of rocket shell
is lost: 

Because the rocket is losing mass, 

so 

We can divide both sides by 
and taking the limit for small
differences, this equation reduces to derive the equation of motion: 

Where we have used 

to eliminate the variable M(t).

Quiz 2 

(b) The solution from (a) can be integrated by multiplying both sides by 
: 

Note that this is just faster than final speed of a rocket of mass 3M that
burns M of its fuel but keeps its shell:
