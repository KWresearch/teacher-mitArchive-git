Problem 1: Quick Multiple Choice Questions [10 pts] 
For each of the following questions circle the correct answer. You do not need to 
show any work. 

(a) A block with mass M and contact area A slides down an inclined plane with 
friction, covering a distance L in time T.  How much time does it take another 
block with the same mass and composition, but twice the surface area, to slide
down the same length? 
0.5T 

2T 

T 

T2 

(b) A particle moves with constant speed from point A
to point E on the path shown to the right.  Among the 
points B, C and D, circle the point where the
magnitude of acceleration is greatest. 

(c) A tire rolls on a flat surface with constant angular 
velocity Ω and velocity 
as shown in the diagram to 
the right.  If V = ΩR, then in which direction does 
friction from the road act on the tire? 

Toward the left  Toward the right  Friction does not act on the tire

Quiz 1 

(d) You pull a brick of mass M sitting on 
a flat table using a thick rope of mass m
(see picture to right).  Friction between 
the surface of the table and the brick is 
sufficient to prevent the brick from moving.  Compared to the force you pull one
end of the rope, the force that the other end of the rope exerts on the brick is: 
Zero 
The same 
Greater 
Less 

(e) As a swinging pendulum passes through its equilibrium point, in which 
direction does the total net force act? 
Radially inward 
Radially outward 

There is zero net force

Problem 2: The Accelerated Atwood Machine [20 pts] 

An idealized Atwood machine (massless pulley and string) connected to two 
blocks of masses M and 2M sits initially at rest on a flat horizontal table. The
coefficient of static and kinetic friction (assumed equal) between the block and 
table surfaces is µ. The pulley is accelerated to the left with magnitude of
acceleration A.  Assume that gravity acts with constant acceleration g down 
through the plane of the table. 
(a) [15 pts] Find the distances each of the two blocks travel from their initial
resting points as a function of time. 
(b) [5 pts] What is the maximum acceleration A for which the block of mass 2M 
will remain stationary?  Is there any case for A > 0 in which this block moves to 
the right?

Problem 3: Oscillation through a Massive Disk [25 pts] 

A small block of mass m lies above a thin disk of total mass M, constant surface
density σ, and radius R.  A hole of radius R/2 is cut into the center of the disk,
allowing the mass to pass through.  The mass starts at a position along the central 
axis of the disk but is displaced a height ∆h from the plane of the disk, where ∆h 
<< R.  There are no other external forces at work on this system; i.e., the disk and 
block are far out in deep space.  Assume m << M. 
(a) [15 pts] Show that to first order in ∆h the block undergoes simple harmonic
motion with respect to the center plane of the disk, and compute the period of
oscillation of the block. 
(b) [10 pts] What is the period of oscillation of the disk, and what is the ratio of the 
amplitude of the disk’s oscillation to that of the block?

Problem 4: Rotating Spring [20 pts] 

A cylindrical mass M is placed on a post connected to a rotating shaft.  The post 
forces the mass to rotate with the shaft at constant angular velocity Ω.  The mass is 
connected to the shaft by a spring with spring constant k and rest length L.  Ignore 
friction and gravity. 
(a) [5 pts] What is the equilibrium distance of the mass from the central shaft? 
(b) [10 pts] At time t=0, the mass is struck, giving it an inward radial velocity VR. 
Derive the period of oscillation of the cylindrical mass and an expression for its
distance from the central shaft as a function of time t. 
(c) [5 pts] What happens when Ω2  > k/M?

Problem 5: The Flyball Governor [25 pts] 

A flyball governor is a device commonly used in steam engines to control the flow
of steam. In the simplified version shown above, a rotating shaft is connected to 
two hinges of mass M through rigid, massless rods of length L.  The rods are also 
attached at the bottom of the device to a larger block of mass 3M which can slide
freely up and down the shaft (in a practical flyball governor, this mass would be
attached to a valve closer to reduce fuel flow).  The shaft rotates at constant 
angular rate ω.  Assume constant gravitational acceleration g acting downward and 
ignore friction and viscosity effects. 
(a) [20 pts] Derive, as a function of ω, the height of the large block above its non-
rotating position. 
(b) [5 pts] Derive an expression relating the vertical speed of the block to the time
rate change in angular rotation rate of the shaft, and confirm that the block moves
upward as the shaft spins faster.
