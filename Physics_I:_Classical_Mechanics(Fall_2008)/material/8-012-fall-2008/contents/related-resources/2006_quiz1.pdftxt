Problem 1: Quick Multiple Choice Questions [10 pts] 
For each of the following questions circle the correct answer.  Note that each 
question is worth only 2 points, so do not spend a lot of time on this part! 
(a) Compared to the gravitational force with which the Earth pulls you, the
gravitational force with which you pull the Earth is 

Greater 

Less 

Equal 	

You exert no gravitational
force on the Earth 

(b) Given a force law  	
[M][L][T]-2 

, what are the dimensions of A? 
[M][L]-1[T]-2 
[L][T]-1 

[M][L]-2[T]-1 

(c) A metal hammer and rubber mallet of identical masses are swung at a nail with
identical speeds.  Which applies the greater impulse? 
Hammer	
Mallet 
The impulses are the same 

(d) A block with mass M and contact area A slides down an inclined plane with
friction, covering a distance L in time T.  How much time does it take another 
block with the same mass and composition, but contact area 2A, to slide down the
same length? 

(e) A pendulum of length L supporting mass M swings back and forth with period
P. 	 If the mass is doubled, what is the new period?

Problem 2: Blocks and Pulley on an Incline [20 pts] 

A block of mass M sits on an inclined plane, and is connected via a massless string
through a massless pulley A (that slide without friction on the plane) to a fixed
post.  This pulley is in turn connected via a massless string through a second
massless pulley B (attached to the top of the inclined plane and oriented to rotate
about a horizontal axle) to a second block of mass 2M that hangs above the
ground.  The coefficient of static friction between the inclined plane and block
resting on the inclined plane is 0 <  < 1.  Gravity is assumed to be acting in a
 
.  The inclined plane is tilted
vertical direction with constant acceleration 
to an angle  with respect to horizontal, and the masses are assumed to be initially
at rest.

 Quiz 1 

(a) [5 pts] Draw force diagrams for both masses and pulley A. Assuming that
pulley A is massless, derive a relation between the tensions of both massless
strings.

 Quiz 1 

(b) [15 pts] Derive a relation, as a function of 
alone, for the minimum angle
that the inclined plane can be tilted before the blocks start to move.  You are 
not asked to solve explicitly for 
in the final relation.

Problem 3: Saving Yourself from a Fall [25 pts] 

An intrepid student of mass 
walks onto a platform of mass 
that is attached 
to the side of a cliff of height H.  When the student reaches the center of the 
platform the support breaks and both the student and platform plunge to the ground
below.  However, just before impact, the student jumps off of the platform with
sufficient force that she reaches zero velocity with respect to the ground ( 
),
thereby saving herself from injury.  In this problem, assume that the acceleration
due to gravity is a constant 
, and that the viscosity of air is negligible.

 Quiz 1 

(a) [5 pts] What is the speed of the platform just as it is about to hit the ground?
What is the speed of the student?

 Quiz 1 

(b) [10 pts] Assuming that the student can jump with a velocity  with respect to
the platform (at the end of her jump), derive an expression for her speed, 
, with
respect to the (unmoving) ground.  Assume that the jump is instantaneous.

 Quiz 1 

(c) [10 pts] To the limit that the platform is much more massive than the student 
( 
), what is the maximum height the student can fall and still jump to
zero velocity with respect to the ground?  Assume that the student can normally
jump to a height of 1 foot from the ground.

Problem 4: Falling through the Center of the Earth (again) [20 pts] 

R 

M 

d 

A tunnel is built connecting two spots on the Earth that follows a straight trajectory
through the interior, but does not intersect the center of the Earth.  Our same poor
intrepid student wanders too close to the tunnel and falls in.  Assume that the Earth 
is a uniform spherical mass M with radius R, and that the medial point of the
tunnel passes to within a distance d of the center. Further assume that the walls of
the tunnel are frictionless, and that the mass excavated from the tunnel is negligible
as compared to the mass of the Earth.

 Quiz 1 

[20 pts] Show that the student will execute simple harmonic motion as she falls
through the tunnel.  Find the time it takes the student to return to her point of
departure and compare this to the time needed for a satellite to circle the Earth in a
low orbit with r ≈ R.  Ignore any effects due to the Earth’s rotation (N.B.: This is
similar to problem 2.26 in K&K).

Problem 5: Rocket on a Rod [25 pts] 

A rocket initially with mass 
is resting on a frictionless table and is connected
to a rigid rod that passes perpendicularly through its center of mass.  The rod is 
 
attached to a vertical post that spins freely without friction.  The rocket is initially
at rest a radius R from the post, which is much greater than the length of the rocket
(you can therefore neglect any torque acting on the rocket).  At t=0, the rocket 
begins firing and shoots out mass at a constant rate 
with velocity 
relative to the rocket 
.  The rocket is prevented from sliding outward by a 
bolt fixed to the rod that exerts a normal force 
.  For this problem, ignore any
forces due to gravity and assume that the rod is effectively massless.

the parameters specified above.  Which component of momentum is conserved
(assuming no net torque on the rocket)?

after the rocket has expended its fuel, equal to 1/2 of its initial mass?
