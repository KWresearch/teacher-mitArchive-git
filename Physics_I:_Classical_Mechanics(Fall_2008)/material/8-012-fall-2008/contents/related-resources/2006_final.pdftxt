Final Exam 

Problem 1: Short Answer Problems [2 pts each] 
(a) List Newton’s three laws (order is not important). 

(b) What are the units of impulse, using the notation [L] =  length, [M] = mass and 
[T] = time? 

(c) An archer in the northern hemisphere on Earth faces North and shoots an arrow 
at very high velocity.  Will the arrow veer off to the left or the right? Justify your
answer (note that the angular velocity vector of the Earth points away from the
North Pole). 

(d) Referring to the figure to the right,
how far from the mass on the left is the 
point at which a test particle feels equal
gravitational force from both spheres?
Assume L is much larger than the radii
of the spheres 

(e) A mass is at rest in an inertial frame at a distance R from the origin.  An 
observer sits at the origin of a rotating frame with angular velocity Ω that is 
initially aligned with the inertial frame.  Describe in words the motion of the object
from the observer’s perspective, and explain how that motion comes about in terms
of fictional forces (there are no real forces acting on the mass).

Problem 2: The Double Gyroscope [15 pts] 

A gyroscope consists of two identical uniform disks with mass M and radius R
mounted on a rigid axle with length 2D.  The axle is fixed to the outer disk, while
the inner disk is allowed to spin freely but is constrained to remain at a distance D
from the pivot (at left) by a collar.  The axle spins about the pivot freely on a 
frictionless mount.  The outer disk and axle are initially spun up to an angular 
frequency ω0.  Assume that the mass of the axle and pivot mount are negligible.
Gravity points downward.  Ignore nutation. 
(a) Calculate the precession rate Ω of the gyroscope assuming that the inner disk is 
not spinning.  Assume that ω0  is very large and the gyroscopic approximation 
applies. 
(b) Friction between the axle and the disk closest to the pivot causes the latter to 
spin up.  Assuming that a constant torque τ acts at the interface between the axle 
and inner hole of this disk, calculate the final spin rate ω of both disks and the final 
precession rate in terms of the initial precession rate. 
(c) How much energy is lost from the gyroscope system during the spinning up of
the inner disk?

Problem 3: Balanced Poles [10 pts] 

Two sticks are attached with frictionless hinges to each other and to a wall, as
shown above. The angle between the sticks is θ. Both sticks have the same 
constant linear mass density λ, and the horizontal stick has length L. Find the force 
(both horizontal and vertical components) that the lower sticks applies to the upper
one where they connect at point A.  Assume gravity points downward.

Problem 4: The Accelerated Atwood Machine [10 pts] 

An idealized Atwood machine, consisting of a two blocks of masses M and 3M
connected via a massless string through a massless pulley, sits on a flat horizontal
table. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and table surfaces is µ.
The pulley is pulled by a string attached to its center and accelerated to the left. 
Assume that gravity acts with constant acceleration g down through the plane of
the table. 
(a) What are the horizontal accelerations of the two masses in the frame of rest of
the table? 
(b) What is the maximum acceleration A for which the block of mass 3M will 
remain stationary?

Problem 5: Central Force Potentials [15 pts]


A particle of mass m is inserted into a central force field of the form


where r is the radial distance from the origin, and k and n are constants. 

(a) Show that the total angular momentum 
constant of the motion. 

about the origin of the system is a 

= L. 
(b) Derive the general effective potential for the system, assuming 
(c) Derive a general expression for the equilibrium point(s) for this potential. 
(d) For what values of n are stable orbits possible; i.e., for which the particle is
constrained to a finite range of r?  Show your results in detail (i.e,. do not simply 
state the answer).

Problem 6: Rolling Platform [15 pts] 

A platform of mass M and uniform density rests on three solid cylinders, each of
mass M, radius R and uniform density.  The whole structure is initially at rest on 
an inclined plane tilted at angle θ, and then released.  Assume that there is no 
slipping between the various surfaces and gravity points downward. 
(a) What is the acceleration of the platform along the incline? 
(b) If the solid cylinders are replaced with hollow cylinders, what is the resulting 
acceleration of the platform? 
(c) Based on the result of part (b), what are the optimal rollers for moving a heavy 
platform such as the one shown above: (1) solid uniform cylinders, (2) hollow
cylinders, or (3) cylinders with mass concentrated at their centers? Justify your
answer (This would have been an engineering consideration for the ancient 
Egyptians when they transported large blocks of stone to construct the Pyramids.)

Problem 7: Spinning Bouncing Ball [15 pts] 

A uniform sphere of mass M and radius R spinning with angular velocity ω is 
dropped from a height H.  It bounces on the floor and recoils with the same vertical 
velocity.  During the bounce, the surface of the ball slips relative to the surface of
the floor (i.e., it does not roll) and in the process the ball is acted upon by a friction 
force with magnitude ƒ = µN, where N is the normal contact force between the ball 
and the floor and µ is a constant. Hence, the ball experiences impulses in both 
vertical and horizontal directions. Assume that the duration of contact, Δt, is very 
short. 
(a) What angle α with respect to vertical does the ball recoil? 
(b) What is the final rotation velocity of the ball? 
(c) What value of H results in the ball bouncing off with no spin?

Problem 8: Orbiting Rope [10 pts] 

A uniform rope of mass m and length R orbits a spherical planet of mass M and 
radius R with constant angular velocity Ω, such that the rope remains straight and 
in a circular orbit by a balance of gravitational and centrifugal forces.  For this 
problem, ignore the effects of air resistance and assume that M >> m. 
(a) Derive an expression for the angular velocity Ω as a function of m, M and R 
(not all three quantities may be in the expression).  Hint: consider the tension in the 
rope as a function of radius. 
(b) What point on the rope experiences the greatest tension (and is thus most likely 
to break)? 
(c) An orbiting rope such as this is one concept for a space elevator, allowing 
material to be transported into orbit without the use of rockets.  What restrictions 
must be made on the angular velocity Ω and the anchor point of the rope on the 
Earth in this case?
