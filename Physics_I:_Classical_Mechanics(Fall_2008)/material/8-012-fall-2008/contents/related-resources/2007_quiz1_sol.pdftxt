Problem 2: The Accelerated Atwood Machine [20 pts] 

An idealized Atwood machine (massless pulley and string) connected to two 
blocks of masses M and 2M sits initially at rest on a flat horizontal table. The
coefficient of static and kinetic friction (assumed equal) between the block and 
table surfaces is µ. The pulley is accelerated to the left with magnitude of
acceleration A.  Assume that gravity acts with constant acceleration g down 
through the plane of the table. 
(a) [15 pts] Find the distances each of the two blocks travel from their initial
resting points as a function of time. 
(b) [5 pts] What is the maximum acceleration A for which the block of mass 2M 
will remain stationary?  Is there any case for A > 0 in which this block moves to 
the right?

SOLUTION 

Quiz 1 

Fig 5a 
(a) The geometry of the problem and force diagrams on for the blocks are shown 
above.  Note that because the pulley is accelerating, we must keep track of its
position in the inertial, one-dimensional coordinate system indicated above.
Friction acts in the negative x direction and is simply equal to the normal force of
the blocks on the surface of the table (their weight) time µ.  The tension force from 
the string is the same for both blocks since the string is massless.  Hence, the 
equations of motion for the two blocks are: 

The constraint equation is the length of the string, L, which must be constant.  The 
string length can be computed as (R is the radius of the pulley wheel): 

Taking the equations of motion, dividing by the lead mass terms and adding the
equations together gives us:

Quiz 1 

And hence: 

These are constant acceleration terms, so the positions of the two masses is readily 
determined (assuming x1(0) = x2(0) = 0 and that the blocks are initially at rest): 

This is only part of the solution, since if A is insufficient to accelerate the larger
block (see next part), then x2(t) = 0 
(b) Based on the equations above, the larger mass will not move if: 

The second mass cannot move backward – the friction forces exactly matches the 
tension from the string for A < µg/2.

Problem 3: Oscillation through a Massive Disk [25 pts] 

A small block of mass m lies above a thin disk of total mass M, constant surface
density σ, and radius R.  A hole of radius R/2 is cut into the center of the disk,
allowing the mass to pass through.  The mass starts at a position along the central 
axis of the disk but is displaced a height ∆h from the plane of the disk, where ∆h 
<< R.  There are no other external forces at work on this system; i.e., the disk and 
block are far out in deep space.  Assume m << M. 
(a) [15 pts] Show that to first order in ∆h the block undergoes simple harmonic
motion with respect to the center plane of the disk, and compute the period of
oscillation of the block. 
(b) [10 pts] What is the period of oscillation of the disk, and what is the ratio of the 
amplitude of the disk’s oscillation to that of the block?

SOLUTION 

Fig 2a 

(a) We break this problem up by considering the gravitational force acting on the
block from one part of the disk dM, and then integrating over the entire disk. From
the symmetry of the problem, we need only worry about the vertical component of
the gravitational force.  The geometry of the problem is illustrated above.  The 
vertical component of force acting from dM is: 

Now make the substitution 
integral can then be solved as: 

and hence 

, then

Quiz 1 

The problem asks to solve this problem to first order in ∆h so we can Taylor 
expand the solution to the integral as: 

Hence, the z-component of gravitation force acting on the mass is, to first order in 
∆h, 

Which is the equation of simple harmonic motion with period 

(b) The force exerted on the block by the disk must be equal and opposite to the
force exerted on the disk by the block; hence: 

The disk should have the same oscillation period as the block as it is always pulled 
back toward the block when the block is on either side.  There is no way for the
oscillations to be “out of phase” since there is no third body to induce a new
frequency.  The equation above does not quite look like it is going to give the same 
frequency.  However, the variables zdisk  and ∆h are not the same, describing the
offset of the disk with respect to some fixed midplane and the offset of the block 

Page 9 of 17 

8.012 Fall 2007 

Quiz 1 

with respect to the disk (we didn’t take into account the fact that ∆h is a non-
inertial coordinate above, but in fact the correction is very small if m << M) .  The 
maxima of ∆h and zdisk  are the amplitudes of oscillation for the block and disk, and 
are exactly 180º out of phase with each other. Hence for the above equation to give 
us the same harmonic motion, we must have: 

i.e., the amplitude of the disk is scaled by a factor m/M to the amplitude of the
block. 
Another way to approach this part is to note that the system is isolated so the center
of mass must remain fixed.  This means that the oscillations must be in phase (so 
the periods are the same) and that:

Problem 4: Rotating Spring [20 pts] 

A cylindrical mass M is placed on a post connected to a rotating shaft.  The post 
forces the mass to rotate with the shaft at constant angular velocity Ω.  The mass is 
connected to the shaft by a spring with spring constant k and rest length L.  Ignore 
friction and gravity. 
(a) [5 pts] What is the equilibrium distance of the mass from the central shaft? 
(b) [10 pts] At time t=0, the mass is struck, giving it an inward radial velocity VR. 
Derive the period of oscillation of the cylindrical mass and an expression for its
distance from the central shaft as a function of time t. 
(c) [5 pts] What happens when Ω2  > k/M? 

Page 11 of 17 

Quiz 1 

8.012 Fall 2007 

SOLUTION 

Fig 3a 

(a) Because of the constraint of the post, we are only interested in radial motion.
The only identifiable force acting on the system is the restoring spring force.
Hence, writing the equations down in radial coordinates, and assuming r is fixed at 
req, 

(b) As r is no longer fixed, the equations of motion become: 

Make the substitution 

and hence 

This is the general expression for simple harmonic motion where

and hence 

The solution with time is: 

The initial conditions are 
-Vr, so 

Quiz 1 

and 

, hence B=0 and Aω = 

(c) If Ω2  approaches k/M, the equilibrium length tends toward ∞ and the period 
tends toward 0, indicating a situation in which the spring becomes “fully 
stretched”.  This limit cannot be realized in nature; before this happens tension 
forces between the molecules of the spring will keep it intact, unless the system
rotates so fast that the spring snaps or detaches from the central shaft.

Problem 5: The Flyball Governor [25 pts] 

A flyball governor is a device commonly used in steam engines to control the flow
of steam. In the simplified version shown above, a rotating shaft is connected to 
two hinges of mass M through rigid, massless rods of length L.  The rods are also 
attached at the bottom of the device to a larger block of mass 3M which can slide
freely up and down the shaft (in a practical flyball governor, this mass would be
attached to a valve closer to reduce fuel flow).  The shaft rotates at constant 
angular rate ω.  Assume constant gravitational acceleration g acting downward and 
ignore friction and viscosity effects. 
(a) [20 pts] Derive, as a function of ω, the height of the large block above its non-
rotating position. 
(b) [5 pts] Derive an expression relating the vertical speed of the block to the time
rate change in angular rotation rate of the shaft, and confirm that the block moves
upward as the shaft spins faster.

Quiz 1 

8.012 Fall 2007 

SOLUTION 

Fig 5a 

(a) Force diagrams for each of the hinges are shown above.  Assume that the angle 
between the rods and the vertical is α, so that the height of the block is: 

and the radial distance of the hinges from the central shaft is 

We adopt a cylindrical coordinate system, ignoring the  direction.  For each hinge 
the equations of motion are identical: 

The unknown variable T’ can be found by dividing both equations though by the
appropriate trignometric function of α and adding them together, yielding: 

We are only concerned about the z component of motion for the block, and this 
equation of motion is:

Quiz 1 

hence 

**Note that this expression only applies for a minimum value of ω; i.e., h cannot
be negative. This minimum values corresponds to the rotation speed required for
the object to lift up. 
(b) An expression for the vertical speed of the block and be derived simply by 
taking the derivative of our solution to part (a): 

Since positive dh/dt corresponds to motion upwards, then an increase in spin rate
(dω/dt > 0) does correspond to lift in the block. 
** Note that this assumes slow increases in h and/or ω - if the block accelerates 
appreciably, the rods may also push out the hinges, and an oscillation may insue.
Note also that, again, ω cannot equal 0 so the infinite solution is avoided.
