Quiz 2 

Problem 1: Quick Multiple Choice Questions [10 pts] 
Answer all five problems. You do not need to show any work. Do not spend a 
long time on this section. 

(a) What are the dimensions of the universal gravitational constant G? Recall that
[M] = mass, [L] = length and [T] = time 
[M][L]2[T]-1 
[M][L][T]-2 

[M]-1[L]2[T]-1 

[M]-1[L]3[T]-2 

(b) A uniform disk of radius R has a circular hole of
diameter R cut out of it.  The hole lies between the outer 
edge of the disk and the center of the disk, as shown to the
right.  Mark with an “X” where the center of mass of this 
disk lies. 

(c) A hollow cylinder rolls up an incline without
slipping.  In which direction is the friction force
between the cylinder and incline surfaces acting? 

Down the incline 

Up the incline 

There is no friction force 
acting on the cylinder

Quiz 2 

(d) Consider the one-dimensional potential function shown below.  Assume that an 
object in this potential starts at x = xo  at rest.  Indicate on the plot the maximum
value of x the object can attain and circle the stable equilibrium points in this 
range. 

(e) A ball comes in from the left with speed 1 (in arbitrary units) and causes a
series of collisions.  The initial motion is shown below (the number in the circles
indicates the objects’ relative masses): 

All collisions are elastic.  Which of the following indicates the motions of the balls
after all of the collisions are completed? (circle the correct diagram)

Quiz 2 

Problem 2: The Bowling Ball [25 pts] 

A bowling ball of radius R, mass M and uniform mass density is thrown down a 
lane with initial horizontal speed v0.  The ball is given some backspin – it is spun in 
the opposite direction of motion – with initial angular rate ω0  as shown.  The 
maximum coefficient of friction between the ball and lane surfaces is µ.  Assume 
constant gravitational acceleration  points downward. 
(a) [10 pts] Find the velocity 
and angular rotation rate ω of the ball as a function 
of time after it makes contact with the lane, and up to the point when it starts to roll
without slipping.  Note: directions are important here! 
(b) [10 pts] Find the “final” velocity and angular rotation rate of the ball when it
starts to roll without slipping. 
(c) [5 pts] How must the initial conditions, v0  and ω0, be related for the ball to 
come to rest?

Quiz 2 

Problem 3: A Generic Potential [25 pts] 
Consider the following one-dimensional potential in which an object of mass m 
moves freely: 

where 
is a constant with dimensions of energy and s = x/x0 is a normalized 
dimension of length. 
(a) [5 pts] Sketch this potential as a function of x in the range -3x0  < x < 3xo. 
(b) [5 pts] Derive values for the equilibrium points and determine which of these
are stable. 
(c) [5 pts] Determine the period of small oscillations about the stable equilibrium
point. 
(d) [5 pts] If the mass starts from x = -∞ and moves toward positive x, what is the
minimum total mechanical energy it needs to reach the stable equilibrium point?
What is its velocity at the stable equilibrium point in this case? 
(e) [5 pts] What is the magnitude and direction of the force acting on the mass
when it is at x = 2xo?

Quiz 2 

Problem 4: A Ballistic Rotator [20 pts] 

A thin arrow with length R, mass m and uniform linear mass density λ = M/R is
shot with velocity v into a circular target of radius R, mass M, uniform surface
mass density σ = M/πR2, and negligible thickness (i.e., it is essentially a thin disk).
The arrow head sticks into the target just off center by a distance x < R as shown 
above.  The target is mounted onto a central frictionless shaft, about which it can 
spin freely.  The target is at rest before it is struck by the arrow. 
(a) [10 pts] Find the angular rotation rate of the target (with arrow embedded) after
the arrow strikes it. You can express you answer in terms of IT, the moment of 
inertia of the circular target alone about the rotation axis shown. 
(b) [5 pts] Show that if m << M then to first order the rotation rate depends linearly 
on both x and v. 
(c) [5 pts] Derive an expression for IT  in terms of M and R. Warning! This is a 
difficult problem, so save it for last!

Quiz 2 

Problem 5: The Continuous Multi-stage Rocket [20 pts] 

Consider a rocket of total mass 3M divided equally into payload (at top), rocket
shell, and fuel.  The rocket, initially at rest, ejects its fuel at a constant mass loss 
rate 
and with constant velocity 
relative to the rocket.  However,
for each bit of fuel ejected, the rocket also sheds part of its shell, with the same
mass loss rate as the fuel but with zero velocity relative to the rocket. 
(a) [10 pts] Derive the equation of motion for this rocket, assuming it is moving in 
free space (i.e,. there are no external forces).  Note: this is not necessary going to 
be the same as the standard rocket equation we learned in lecture. 
(b) [10 pts] Determine the final speed of the payload after the fuel and shell are
ejected in terms of M, u and 
.
