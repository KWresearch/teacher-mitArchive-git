Collaboration  policy:  You  are  encouraged  to  freely  discuss  your  homework  problems  with  other 
8.012 students and teaching staff. However, you must write up your solutions completely on your 
ownâ€”do  not  simply  copy  solutions  from  other  students.  You  are  forbidden  from  consulting 
solutions from previous years or from the web. Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary 
action.
