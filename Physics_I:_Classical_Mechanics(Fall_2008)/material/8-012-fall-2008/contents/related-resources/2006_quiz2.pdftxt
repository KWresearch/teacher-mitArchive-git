 Quiz 2 

Problem 1: Masses and Rod [15 pts] 

A block with mass 3M connected to a massless rod of length L lies at rest on a
fixed frictionless table.  A second block of mass M impinges on the system with 
speed v0, strikes the opposite end of the rod at a right angle, and sticks.  For this 
problem, assume that the dimensions of the blocks are much smaller than the
length of the rod. 
(a) [5 pts] What is the final velocity of the center of mass of the block-rod-block
system? 
(b) [5 pts] What is the final angular velocity of the block-rod-block system about
its center of mass? 
(d) [3 pts] What is the initial velocity of the more massive block after the collision?
Be sure to indicate its direction and speed.

 Quiz 2 

Problem 2: An Unusual Force Law [15 pts] 
Consider the following force law: 

for x > 0 , where m is the mass of the object, 
is a constant length and c is the
speed of light (Note: this force is related to the motion of a mass near a black hole). 
(a) [5 pts] Sketch the potential energy of this force law as a function of x.  What 
are the two finite equilibrium points for this force law (i.e., excluding 
)?
Which of these is stable? 
(b) [5 pts] Compute the period of small oscillations about the stable equilibrium
point. 
(c) [5 pts] An object of mass m, initially at rest at the unstable equilibrium point,
moves toward the stable equilibrium point.  What is its velocity at the stable
equilibrium point?

Problem 3: Particle Collision [30 pts] 

A particle of mass m and velocity 
collides with a particle of mass 3m at
rest in the LAB frame.  The ensuing interaction creates two particles with identical 
masses 2m that scatter off with velocities 
and 
at angles 
and 
from the
 axis, respectively, in the LAB frame.  A mechanical energy Q is lost as a result
of the interaction.  Assume that there are no external forces at work. 

(a) [10 pts] What is the minimum kinetic energy (K0) of the incident particle
required for this interaction to take place? 

(b) [10 pts] Assume that the incident particle has initial kinetic energy K =  K0 
where 
> 1.  Write an expression relating the scattering angle 
in the LAB 
frame to the center of mass scattering angle 
(the deflection angle of the particles
in the center of mass frame) that depends only on 
. 
(c) [10 pts] One of the scattered particles is observed to emerge at an angle of 90º
with respect to the 
axis in the LAB frame. In the limit that the kinetic energy of
the incident particle is much larger than the minimum energy (i.e., 
>> 1), what 
is the maximum interaction scattering angle 
for which this could occur?  Note: 
this can be solved without doing part (b).

Problem 4: Spinning Disk and Hoop [20 pts] 

A uniform hoop with mass M, outer radius R and inner radius R/2 is initially 
spinning with angular velocity 
0.  The hoop is placed onto a uniform disk, also
of mass M and outer radius R, that is initially at rest on a fixed frictionless table.
The hoop and disk are aligned along their centers of mass.  There is a coefficient of 
friction 
between the hoop and disk where their surfaces make contact.
Gravitational acceleration is assumed to be constant and points downward. 

(a) [10 pts] What is the initial torque (about its center of mass) acting on the disk?
What is the initial torque (about its center of mass) acting on the hoop? 
(b) [5 pts] The friction force between the hoop and disk cause them to eventually
spin at the same angular velocity.  What is this angular velocity? 
(c) [5 pts] How much time does it take for the disk and hoop to reach this common
angular velocity?

 Quiz 2 

Problem 5: Spring-loaded Tube [20 pts] 

A block of mass M and velocity v0 is moving through a fixed tube with frictionless
walls.  At the bottom of a loop of radius R, the block collides perfectly inelastically
(i.e., it sticks) with a plunger of mass M connected to a long fixed spring with
spring constant k and equilibrium length πR.  As the plunger and block travel 
around the loop, they are also acted on by a drag force 
; i.e., a force
that acts opposite to the direction of motion.  Gravitational acceleration acts 
downward.  Assume that the dimensions of the block and plunger are much smaller
than R, so that their rotation about their centers of mass are negligible. 
(a) [10 pts] What is the incoming block’s velocity if the plunger and block come to
rest at  = π/2? 
(b) [10 pts] Continuing from (a), after the block/plunger pair stop at  = π/2, they
swing back around the loop and out into the straight, frictionless linear tube.  If 
there are no adhesive forces that keep the block and plunger bound to each other, at
what point does the block move away from the plunger and with what speed?
