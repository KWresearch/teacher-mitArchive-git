Problem 1: Short Answer Problems [2 pts each] 
(a) List Newton’s three laws (order is not important). 

(b) What are the units of impulse, using the notation [L] =  length, [M] = mass and 
[T] = time? 

(c) An archer in the northern hemisphere on Earth faces North and shoots an arrow 
at very high velocity.  Will the arrow veer off to the left or the right? Justify your
answer (note that the angular velocity vector of the Earth points away from the
North Pole). 

(d) Referring to the figure to the right,
how far from the mass on the left is the 
point at which a test particle feels equal
gravitational force from both spheres?
Assume L is much larger than the radii
of the spheres 

(e) A mass is at rest in an inertial frame at a distance R from the origin.  An 
observer sits at the origin of a rotating frame with angular velocity Ω that is 
initially aligned with the inertial frame.  Describe in words the motion of the object
from the observer’s perspective, and explain how that motion comes about in terms
of fictional forces (there are no real forces acting on the mass).

(a) 
(i) An object at rest or in uniform motion tends to stay at rest or in uniform 
motion unless acted on by an outside force (e.g., inertial frames exist) 
- acceleration is proportional to force and inversely 
(ii)

- force exerted by one body onto a second body is equal 
(iii) 
and directed in the opposite direction to the force exerted by the second body onto 
the first 

(b) Impulse = FxΔt = Δp = [M] [L] [T]-1 

(c) The veering of the arrow results from Coriolis force and is directed toward the 
right. 
which is to the right when facing 
north. 

(d) Total forces cancel at a distance x from the left sphere when:

Final Exam 

This quadratic equation is solved for x = L/3 (the negative solution, x=-L, does not 
correspond to a point where there is zero net force). 

(e) To the observer in the rotating frame, the mass would appear to move in a circle 
of radius R about origin with velocity v = RΩ in the opposite sense of the rotation 
of the frame.  This is consistent with the fictional forces experienced by the mass 
as both centrifugal and coriolis accelerations contribute, giving 

This net (fictional) force provides the necessary centripetal acceleration to keep 
the object moving in a fixed radius circle.

Problem 2: The Double Gyroscope [15 pts] 

A gyroscope consists of two identical uniform disks with mass M and radius R
mounted on a rigid axle with length 2D.  The axle is fixed to the outer disk, while
the inner disk is allowed to spin freely but is constrained to remain at a distance D
from the pivot (at left) by a collar.  The axle spins about the pivot freely on a 
frictionless mount.  The outer disk and axle are initially spun up to an angular 
frequency ω0.  Assume that the mass of the axle and pivot mount are negligible.
Gravity points downward.  Ignore nutation. 
(a) Calculate the precession rate Ω of the gyroscope assuming that the inner disk is 
not spinning.  Assume that ω0  is very large and the gyroscopic approximation 
applies. 
(b) Friction between the axle and the disk closest to the pivot causes the latter to 
spin up.  Assuming that a constant torque τ acts at the interface between the axle 
and inner hole of this disk, calculate the final spin rate ω of both disks and the final 
precession rate in terms of the initial precession rate. 
(c) How much energy is lost from the gyroscope system during the spinning up of
the inner disk?

8.012 Fall 2006 

Final Exam 

(a) The net torque on the gyroscope with respect to the pivot point is 

The gyroscope approximation is: 

The angular momentum of the first disk is 

Hence 

(b) The constant frictional torque is 

Hence: 

This is the result of the force from the axle acting on the inner wheel; Newton’s 
third law tells us that an equal and opposite force acts on the axle + outer wheel 
and slows it down.  Hence 

The frictional force ceases when the surfaces do not slide relative to one another, 
, so 
i.e., when 

Page 6 of 27 

8.012 Fall 2006 

Final Exam 

To calculate the precession, note that the torque hasn’t changed, while the 
magnitude of the angular momentum vector is 

and is therefore also unchanged.  So the precession rate is the same: 

(c) Only the rotational kinetic energy of the system changes as a result of the inner 
wheel spinning up.  The initial rotational kinetic energy is 

where 
is the moment of inertia of the entire gyroscope rotating about the pivot. 
The final rotational kinetic energy is 

Hence the total energy lost is:

Problem 3: Balanced Poles [10 pts] 

Two sticks are attached with frictionless hinges to each other and to a wall, as
shown above. The angle between the sticks is θ. Both sticks have the same 
constant linear mass density λ, and the horizontal stick has length L. Find the force 
(both horizontal and vertical components) that the lower sticks applies to the upper
one where they connect at point A.  Assume gravity points downward. 

Page 8 of 27 

8.012 Fall 2006 

Final Exam 

The best way to approach this problem is to 
balance the forces and torques acting on the 
sticks, since the system is not accelerating 
and not rotating.  A force diagram is shown 
on the left, indicating forces acting on the 
horizontal stick as solid arrows and forces 
acting on the angled stick as dotted arrows. 
The objective is to determine Fh  and Fv. 

First measure the torque on the horizontal stick about point B (assuming torque is 
positive in a clockwise direction on the page): 

Now measure the torque on the angled stick about point B:

Problem 4: The Accelerated Atwood Machine [10 pts] 

An idealized Atwood machine, consisting of a two blocks of masses M and 3M
connected via a massless string through a massless pulley, sits on a flat horizontal
table. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and table surfaces is µ.
The pulley is pulled by a string attached to its center and accelerated to the left. 
Assume that gravity acts with constant acceleration g down through the plane of
the table. 
(a) What are the horizontal accelerations of the two masses in the frame of rest of
the table? 
(b) What is the maximum acceleration A for which the block of mass 3M will 
remain stationary? 

Page 10 of 27 

8.012 Fall 2006 

Final Exam 

This problem is straightforward if one works 
in the accelerated reference frame.  The force 
diagrams for the two masses are shown at 
left. Note the additional fictional forces, and 
the fact that the friction forces both act 
toward the right – this is because in the 
accelerated frame the table is sliding to the 
right, dragging the blocks with it.  The 
tension force acts via the massless string and is the same for both masses. 
The equations of motion for the two blocks are: 

The positions of the masses are constratined to x1  + x3 = constant due to the fixed 
length of rope connecting them; hence 

Replacing this expression in to the equations of motion yield: 

We move to the frame of rest of the table by adding the acceleration A to both 
equations of motion:

(b) Derive the general effective potential for the system, assuming 
(c) Derive a general expression for the equilibrium point(s) for this potential.

constrained to a finite range of r?  Show your results in detail (i.e,. do not simply 
state the answer).

(a) The torque on the mass about the origin is: 

Hence, the angular momentum vector about the origin is a constant of the motion. 

(b) The effective potential is

We can choose a zeropoint such that U(∞) = 0, which for n > 1 implies C = 0, and

Problem 6: Rolling Platform [15 pts] 

A platform of mass M and uniform density rests on three solid cylinders, each of
mass M, radius R and uniform density.  The whole structure is initially at rest on 
an inclined plane tilted at angle θ, and then released.  Assume that there is no 
slipping between the various surfaces and gravity points downward. 
(a) What is the acceleration of the platform along the incline? 
(b) If the solid cylinders are replaced with hollow cylinders, what is the resulting 
acceleration of the platform? 
(c) Based on the result of part (b), what are the optimal rollers for moving a heavy 
platform such as the one shown above: (1) solid uniform cylinders, (2) hollow
cylinders, or (3) cylinders with mass concentrated at their centers? Justify your
answer (This would have been an engineering consideration for the ancient 
Egyptians when they transported large blocks of stone to construct the Pyramids.) 

Page 16 of 27 

8.012 Fall 2006 

Final Exam 

(a) There are two main points to this problem that must be recognized to solve it. 
The first is that friction must act between the wheels and platform, and between the 
wheels and incline, and that the former modifies the acceleration of the platform. 
The second is that the no slipping constraint applies between the wheels and 
platform and the wheels and incline, so 

Where φ is the angular motion of the wheel. 

This problem can be solved in two ways: by solving the translational and rotational 
equations of motion and applying the constraint equations and using energy. 

The first solution is built upon the force diagrams shown above.  Note the 
matching of forces between the wheel and platform (ƒ and N).  Also note that we 
have not assumed ƒ = ƒ’, nor have we assumed a relation between ƒ and N based 
on the (unknown) coefficient of friction.  We can restrict analysis to the platform 
and one wheel, since the other wheels will experience the same motion.  The 
translational equations of motion for the platform are (note the directions of x and 
y from the figures): 

Page 17 of 27 

8.012 Fall 2006 

Final Exam 

The translational equations of motion for each wheel are 

The wheel also spins, so we need to calculate rotational equations of motion.  To 
do this we choose a fixed point parallel to the incline that is aligned with center of 
the wheel – we cannot chose the center of the wheel as our reference point because 
the wheel is accelerating down the incline.  Hence, 

where the xw  terms have dropped out based on the y-axis equation of motion of the

wheel above.

Now we apply the constraint equations to the xp, xw  and φ equations of motion,

and assume

giving: 

Using these equations to eliminate ƒ and ƒ’ yields: 

The alternate derivation of the solution involves computing the change in energy 
for the system, which is conserved since the friction forces do no work (the 
surfaces are not slipping relative to each other).  Assuming that the system starts 
from rest at xp  = xw = 0, then 

Page 18 of 27 

8.012 Fall 2006 

Final Exam 

where the constraint equations have been used in the last step.  Taking a time 
derivative of this equation, and again using the constraint equations gives: 

(b) Changing the moment of inertia to 
of motion in the first solution to: 

changes the rotational equation 

This results in ƒ = 0, so 

Similarly, we could replace the rotational energy term in the second solution and 
derive the same result. 

(c) This question is subjective, but one may consider that an optimal engineering 
choice is to obtain the most acceleration for the least force applied.  Since the force 
applied must also compensate for the motion of the rollers, the minimum moment 
of inertia for the rollers is optimal, which would be the case for those with mass 
concentrated at the center.

Problem 7: Spinning Bouncing Ball [15 pts] 

A uniform sphere of mass M and radius R spinning with angular velocity ω is 
dropped from a height H.  It bounces on the floor and recoils with the same vertical 
velocity.  During the bounce, the surface of the ball slips relative to the surface of
the floor (i.e., it does not roll) and in the process the ball is acted upon by a friction 
force with magnitude ƒ = µN, where N is the normal contact force between the ball 
and the floor and µ is a constant. Hence, the ball experiences impulses in both 
vertical and horizontal directions. Assume that the duration of contact, Δt, is very 
short. 
(a) What angle α with respect to vertical does the ball recoil? 
(b) What is the final rotation velocity of the ball? 
(c) What value of H results in the ball bouncing off with no spin? 

Page 20 of 27 

8.012 Fall 2006 

Final Exam 

(a) The angle α is related to the horizontal and vertical components of the ball’s 
velocity after the bounce.  The vertical component is straightforward, as it is stated 
in the problem that it rebounds with the same velocity as it struck the ground, 
which is: 

The horizontal component arise from the impulse due to friction acting at the 
contact surface: 

This is related to the vertical impulse by: 

Hence: 

and: 

(b) The frictional force produces a torque that acts in the opposite direction as the 
spinning of the ball. This torque exerts a rotational impulse (change in angular 
momentum): 

Hence, 

Using the momentum of inertia for a sphere:

yields 

(c) For no spin after the bounce, ω = 0, so

Problem 8: Orbiting Rope [10 pts] 

A uniform rope of mass m and length R orbits a spherical planet of mass M and 
radius R with constant angular velocity Ω, such that the rope remains straight and 
in a circular orbit by a balance of gravitational and centrifugal forces.  For this 
problem, ignore the effects of air resistance and assume that M >> m. 
(a) Derive an expression for the angular velocity Ω as a function of m, M and R 
(not all three quantities may be in the expression).  Hint: consider the tension in the 
rope as a function of radius. 
(b) What point on the rope experiences the greatest tension (and is thus most likely 
to break)? 
(c) An orbiting rope such as this is one concept for a space elevator, allowing 
material to be transported into orbit without the use of rockets.  What restrictions 
must be made on the angular velocity Ω and the anchor point of the rope on the 
Earth in this case? 

Page 23 of 27 

8.012 Fall 2006 

Final Exam 

(a) The best way to approach this problem is to take the hint and consider how 
tension varies along the rope.  Consider a small section of rope of length dr and 
mass dm at radius r, and assume a coordinate system that rotates with the rope. 
The forces acting on that piece of rope, including gravitational, centrifugal 
(fictional) and radius-dependent tension, are illustrated below.  Note that Coriolis 
force does not act because the rope has no velocity in the rotating frame of 
reference. 

The net force acting on this piece of rope must be equal to zero: 

where dT is the differential change in the tension along the rope.  Taking the 
intergral of this expression: 

The tension at the ends of the rope must vanish.  We have explicitly assumed that 
the T(0) = 0, so now consider that the tension at the far end T(R) = 0; then 

Page 24 of 27 

8.012 Fall 2006 

Final Exam 

(b) Extremum point in tension occurs when dT/dr = 0, or 

(c) For this kind of space elevator to work, the end point closest to the ground must 
stay at the same spot relative to the Earth on its own, otherwise it will be too hard 
to attach anything to the rope, and if the rope were anchored to the ground it would 
quickly get wrapped up and would likely fall to the Earth.  Hence, the angular 
velocity should match the angular rotation rate of the Earth.  Also, the anchor spot 
should be as close to the equator as possible, for otherwise the end of the rope will 
drift north to south as it completes a full orbit (this is why gyrosynchronous 
satellites tend to be above the equator).  Note that many effects limit the feasibility 
of a space elevator that we’ve ignored here, such air resistance and winds, nutation 
effects on spin axis of the Earth, deviations of the Earth’s shape from a perfect 
sphere and the tensile strength of the rope.
