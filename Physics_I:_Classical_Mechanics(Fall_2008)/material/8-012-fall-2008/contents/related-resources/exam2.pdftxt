1.	 Problem  1  of  5 
Two  railcars  and  a   cannon.  (15  points)


Two  railcars   are   moving,  unpowered,  in  the   same   direction  along  a  horizontal  track.  Car  B,

which  has   mass   MB  and  velocity  VB ,  carries  a   pro jectile   of  mass   m.


•  Initially,  car  B  is   being  overtaken  by  car   A,  which  has  mass  MA  and  velocity  VA ,  with 
V
A  > VB  (top  ﬁgure). 
•	 The  pro jectile  is   then   ﬁred   from  car  B  to  car  A   with  horizontal  velocity  of  magnitude  u 
relative  to  car  B,  after  which  car  B  moves   with  velocity  VF  (midd le  ﬁgure). 
•	 Finally,  the  pro jectile   comes  to  an  abrupt stop after   striking car   A,  after  which  both cars 
are  travelling  at  the  same  velocity  VF  (bottom  ﬁgure). 

You  may  neglect  any  vertical  motion  of  the  pro jectile  after  it  is  ﬁred. 

(a)  (7  points) Calculate  car  B’s   ﬁnal  velocity  VF  in  terms  of  VB ,  u,  and  the   masses.  

(b)   (8  points) Calculate   the  required  muzzle  velocity  u of  the  pro jectile  such  that   the   ﬁnal 
velocity  of  car  A  is  also  VF  .  Express   your   answer   in  terms  of  VA ,  VB ,  and  the   masses. 

2.  Problem  2  of  5 
Power   boat.  (20  points) 

A  jet  boat  propels  itself   by  taking  up  (stationary)  water  at  a  constant  mass   rate   dm/dt  =  a 
and  expelling  it  with   velocity  of  magnitude   u  with  respect  to  the   boat.  The  mass   M  of  the 
boat   is   constant  (you  may  neglect  the  fuel  used  to  power  the  engine). 

(a)  (12  points)  Neglecting  any  drag  force   due  to  the  boat’s  passage  through  the  water, 
calculate  the  velocity  of  the  boat  as   a  function  of  time,  assuming  it   starts  from   rest  at 
time  t  = 0. Sketch   v (t). 
(b)   (8  points) Now,  assume   the  boat  starts  from  rest  but   experiences  a  drag  force   Fd  =  −bv 
due  to  its   passage  through the   water,  where   v  is   the  boat’s  velocity vector. The   boat will 
eventually  reach   a  constant  terminal  velocity  vf .  Calculate  vf . [You  are  not  required to 
calculate  v (t) for  all  t.] 

3.  Problem  3  of  5 
Mass  on  a  sphere.  (25  points) 


A  mass   m  rests  on  top   of  a  ﬁxed  sphere  of  radius  R.  The  mass   is   released  with  negligible 

speed  to  the  right,  and  it  slowly  starts  to  slide  down  the  sphere  (with  increasing   angle  θ).  A

frictional  force  F0  sin  θ  opposes  the  motion  as  long  as  the  mass   is  in  contact  with  the  sphere.

Gravity  acts   downward.


(a)  (9  points)  Find the  total mechanical energy  E  as  a  function  of  θ,  taking   E  = 0 at  the  top 
of the  sphere  (where  θ  = 0). (Hint:  Your  answer  should  not  have  any explicit  dependence 
on  velocity.)  

(b)   (8  points) Find the  kinetic   energy  as  a  function  of  θ. 

(c)  (8  points) Calculate   the  angle   at  which  the  mass  loses  contact  with the  sphere. 

4.  Problem  4  of  5 
Particle  in  a  1-D  potential.   (20  points)


A  particle  of   mass   M  moves  in  one   dimension  along  the   x-axis.  Its  potential  energy  is  given

by  U (x) =  ax3 
− bx,  where  a  and  b  are  positive   constants.

(a)  (4  points) Calculate   the  force  on  the  particle,  F (x).  Find  the  position  of  all  equilibrium 
points,  and   identify them   as  stable  or  unstable. 

(b)   (4  points) Draw  an   energy  diagram  showing the  potential  energy  U ,  the   kinetic  energy 
K ,  and  the  total  mechanical  energy  E  for  bound motion. Show   the  location  of the  stable 
and  unstable  equilibrium   points  on  your  diagram. 

(c)  (4  points) What  is   the  minimum  kinetic  energy  required  for   the  particle  to  be  unbound? 

(d)   (4  points) Find the  period  of  small  oscillations  around  the  stable  equilibrium. 

(e)  (4  points)  Estimate  the   maximum  displacement  from  equilibrium  for   which  the  small 
oscillation  approximation   is  valid  to   1  percent  accuracy. 

5.  Problem  5  of  5 
Particle  proofs.  (20  points)  

(a)  Two-body  collision  in  two  dimensions.  (10  points) A  moving  particle  collides  elas(cid:173)
tically  with   an  equally  massive   particle  at  rest.  After  the   collision,  neither   of  the  two 
particles  is   moving  parallel  to  the   initial  velocity.  Assume  that  there   are  no   external 
forces   acting  on  the   particles.  Show   that  the  two  particles  must  move  at  right  angles 
to  one  another  after   the  collision  (i.e.,  show  that  in  the   ﬁgure  below,  θ1  +  θ2  = 90◦ ,  or 
equivalently  v1  ·  v2  = 0). 

(b)   Angular  momentum  of  a  system  of  particles.  (10  points) Show  that  if  the   total 
linear  momentum  of  a  system  of  particles  is  zero,  then  the  total  angular  momentum  of 
the  system   is  the  same   with   respect  to  all  origins. 

Useful  vector  relation:  (a  ×  b) × c  = (a  ×  c) +  (b  ×  c)
