2 views of preferences 

Economic vs. Psychological  


•  Economic view 
–  preferences are fixed, stable, precise 
–  labels don't matter (e.g., 10% fat = 90% lean) 
–  pairwise preferences do not depend on the other options 
in the choice set. 
•  Psychological view. 
–  preferences are easily manipulated, unstable, fuzzy 
–  preferences depend on how the choice is "framed" 
–  pairwise preferences sensitive to particular choice set. 

Do people have precise values?

I once paid $2.25 for a tiny cognac truffle at a Toiva candy store.  After I 
had eaten it, my friend asked me "Was it was worth the money?" 
I pondered his question.  I first considered what else I could have gotten 
for $2.25-- four Snickers bars, a copy of Sports Illustrated, or a nicer glass 
of wine at dinner later that night.  Or, I could have saved the money-- it's 
not much, but together with other small sacrifices, maybe I could get a 
nicer apartment next year.  Then I tried to imagine the value of those 
alternate experiences.  I recalled that Snickers taste pretty good too--
maybe not as good as this truffle, but pretty good-- and two Snickers would 
have lasted a lot longer.  And although a more spacious apartment would 
be great, it would be $100 more a month, and that would mean hundreds of 
such sacrifices over the course of a year.  I then began to evaluate those 
tradeoffs in a larger context of choices, and thought, Hell, if I'm going to 
give up anything, I should give up cable TV.  I don't watch TV that much 
anyway.  With the $32 a month I'd save, I could have all the truffles I want. 
But the NBA playoffs are coming up....hmm....  Finally, I turned to my 
friend and admitted "I don't know."

Ethical Rules

•  ARE DISTINCT FROM LEGAL RULES 
•  CHANGE OVER TIME 
–  e.g., men going topless 
•  DIFFER ACROSS SOCIETIES 
–  e.g., women going topless 
–  cannibalism 

•  SOMETIMES CONFLICT WITH ONE ANOTHER: 
–  e.g., "How do you like my new haircut?" 
•  What are the principles being weighed against one another? 

Ethics in Business:

Two concepts of corporate responsibility 

•  Profit Responsibility 
–	 "There is one and only one social responsibility of business --- to 
engage in activities designed to increase its profits." 
Milton Friedman 

•  Social Responsibility 
–  McDonald's voluntarily stopped using styrofoam containers 
–  Perrier voluntarily recalled 160 million bottles of water 

•  Do these two concepts conflict or coincide? 

"We wanted to remove any doubt, minimal as it might be, that would 
weigh on the image of the quality and purity of our product." 

Is marketing unethical?


deceptive packaging & advertising 
the creation of "false" needs 
"The trade of advertising is now so near to perfection, it is not easy 
to propose any improvement.  But as every art ought to be exercised 
in due subordination to the publick good, I cannot but propose it as 
a moral question whether [advertisers] do not sometimes play too 
wantonly with our passions."  (Samuel Johnson, 1759)

In 1990, the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company planned to 
test market Uptown cigarettes in Philadelphia. 
�	 Uptown was targeted at black male smokers, because tests 
showed that this segment had a much higher preference for 
menthol cigarettes than other segments. 
�	 Black men have a 58% higher incidence of lung cancer 
than white men. 
�	 Menthol cigarettes are no more dangerous than regular 
cigarettes. 

Is it unethical to market Uptown?:  3 views


"This brand is cynically and deliberately targeted toward black Americans 
… when our people desperately need the message of health promotion, 
Uptown's message is more disease, more suffering, and more death for 
a group already bearing more than its share of smoking-related illness 
and mortality" 
Louis Sullivan (HHS) 

"We regret that a small coalition of anti-smoking zealots apparently 
believes that black smokers are somehow different from others who 
choose to smoke" 

R.J. Reynolds Tobacco 

"Targeting is a standard procedure for marketing…this is a product that 
is deadly when used as intended; that's the real issue"
