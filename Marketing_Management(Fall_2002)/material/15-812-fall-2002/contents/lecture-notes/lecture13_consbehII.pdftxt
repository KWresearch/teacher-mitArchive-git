"Suppose you are considering buying a CD player and have 
not yet decided what model to buy.  You pass by a store that 
is having a 1-day clearance sale.  They offer a popular SONY 
player for just $99, [and a top-of-the-line AIWA player for 
just $169.  Both are] well below the list price."

"You are lying on the beach on a hot day.  All you have to 
drink is a bottle of water.  For the last hour you have been 
thinking about how much you would enjoy a nice cold 
bottle of your favorite beer.  A companion gets up to go 
make a phone call and offers to brink back a beer from the 
only nearby place where beer is sold -- (a fancy resort 
hotel) [a run down grocery store].  He says that the beers 
might be expensive and so asks how much you are willing 
to pay for the beer.  He says that he will buy the beer if it 
costs less than the price you state, but if it costs more, he 
will not buy it." 

What price do you state?  $______.___

Why study consumer behavior? 

•  Until now, we have focused on consumer needs 
–  identifying needs through market research 
–  satisfying needs through product design 
–  *make more profit by understanding what people want 

•	 Consumer behavior is about the psychological processes 
that underlie consumer choices. 
–  identifying the simplifying choice rules consumers use 
–  discovering how "framing" of a decision affects preferences 
–  *make more profit by understanding how they think 

The Sachet Lecture 

•	

1.  What is it used for?  What 
needs/wants does it satisfy?  Why 
would someone buy it? 

•  2.  What is the target market? 

•  3.  What are substitutes?

Should consumers be followed or led?  


•	

“Our plan is to lead the public with new products rather than ask them 
what kind of products they want.  The public does not know what is 
possible, but we do.  So instead of doing a lot of market research, we 
…try to create a market for a product by educating [the public about 
what the product can do for them]. ” 

(Akio Morita, CEO of Sony)

those within a group will respond similarly to a marketing 
action and those in different groups will respond differently.
