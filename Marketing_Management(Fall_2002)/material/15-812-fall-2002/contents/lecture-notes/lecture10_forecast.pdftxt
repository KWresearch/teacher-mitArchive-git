•  Market Size vs. Market Share 
•  Estimate total annual demand for plastic diapers 
•  "Hierarchy of Effects" model 
•  3 methods for forecasting demand 
–  historical trends 
–  surveys 
–  test markets

Promoting Primary Demand (market size)  

or Selective Demand (market share)


•	

in 1907, an advertising executive for Campbell's Pork and 
Beans found that 94% of housewives cooked their own 
beans from scratch. 
•	 Campbell's had 36% market share.  7 competitors 
collectively had 64% market share. 
In blind taste test, Campbell's got the highest ratings of all 
the brands 

•	

•	 Should Campbells run an ad that focuses on the time 
saving of using canned beans, or should it focus on the 
fact that it has a better product than its competitors?

What is the potential annual demand

for plastic diapers?


•  4 million babies delivered each year in U.S. 
•  Babies defecate about 10 times per day at birth 
•  Children defecate about 4 times per day at age 3 
•  Few kids are toilet trained before age 2 
•  But almost all are toilet trained by age 3

3 bases of demand forecasts: 

•  What people have done 
–  extrapolation (time series analysis) 
–  statistical demand analysis 
•  What people say they will do 
–  surveys 
•  What people actually do 
–  laboratory markets 
–  test markets

Simulated markets 

Laboratory market: 
•  respondents given $20 
•  complete initial survey (perceptions & preference) 
•  shown advertising for competing brands & new brand 
•  enter simulated retail store with, say, deodorants 
•  spend any amount of money from $0 to $20 
•  samples given to those who do not buy new product 
•  "purchasers" vs. "free samples" recorded 
•  follow-up telephone interview 

Test markets 


Actual test market: 
•  Product is actually "launched" in a limited way 
•  What types of cities are chosen? 
•  What is the benefit of a test market? 
•  For what types of goods are test markets not feasible? 
•  What are drawbacks to test marketing? 

Key Points or "Take Aways" 

•	 Company can grow by expanding market size or 
stealing market share 
•	 Size of the potential market depends on how broadly 
one thinks about the product (Are coffee and beer 
substitutes?) 
•  Often useful to decompose forecasts 
–  unawareﬁ aware 
–  aware ﬁ trial 
–  trial ﬁ repurchase 
•  3 methods of demand forecasts 
–  historical trends (dangers of extrapolation) 
–  surveys (dangers of trusting reports; answers "labile") 
–  test markets (dangers of competitors fiddling & stealing)
