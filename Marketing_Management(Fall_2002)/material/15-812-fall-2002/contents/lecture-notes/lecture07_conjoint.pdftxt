Measuring preferences is central to

market research:


•  Do consumers prefer glass bottles or plastic bottles? 
•  Would consumers pay 35 cents more for a plastic bottle? 
•  What is "more important" in yogurt:  taste or texture? 
•	 What proportion of consumers would be willing to have the 
weight of their laptop increased by 50% in order to double 
the processing speed? 
•	 How much more would a person be willing to pay for an 
acrylic aquariums if it were scratch proof ?  If it were algae 
resistant?  If it were 25% lighter?  40% stronger?  If it had 
curved corners? 
•	 Would the customer's value of this feature justify the cost of 
producing it?

Conjoint Analysis


•  products can be broken down into attributes 
•  marketers want to know relative importances 
•  difficult to express utility functions directly 
•  easier to choose between products or rate them 
•  attribute weights can be inferred from choices, 
these inferred attribute weights can then be used to 
•	
assign utilities to various products and to predict 
consumer preferences (& to segment markets)

Conjoint Analysis:

conceptual & operational problems


•	 Sometimes difficult to decompose products into more 
elementary attributes 
•  The task is not "ecologically valid" 
•  The attribute combinations are not believeable 
•  Task is tedious and boring 
•	 People don’t understand what the attributes or attribute 
levels refer to (e.g.,"Total Harmonic Distortion" = "5"?) 
results are sensitive to how many attributes are used, how 
many levels are used, whether rating or ranking tasks are 
used, and a whole bunch of other things 
•	 self explicated importance ratings can be ambiguous for 
continuous variables

SINGLE DIFFERENCE shown below, how 
important would THAT DIFFERENCE be? 

A:  Made in USA

B:  Made in Japan


4 = Extremely (I could not accept B, even if perfect in every other way) 
3 = Very (B would have to be outstanding in other ways) 
2 = Somewhat (But I would not base my decision on this) 
1 = Not important at all

4(2) = 4! ÷ [(4-2)!] (2!)


4(2) =
