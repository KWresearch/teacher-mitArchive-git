Southwest Airlines

Who was Southwest Airlines major competitor?

(cid:190) "We've always seen our competition as the car.  We've got 
to offer better, more convenient service at a price that 
makes it worthwhile to leave your car at home and fly with 
us instead." 

(Colleen Barrett, executive vice president)

Southwest Airlines

• Why did the president feel that the current level of 
usage underestimated potential demand? 

(cid:190)

Because the interstate carriers weren't doing the job in this market. 

(cid:190) it was difficult to get reservations (Why?)
(cid:190) poor record for punctuality (Why?) 
(cid:190) poor service (Why?)

Southwest Airlines
(cid:190) What were SW's innovations?
fun atmosphere 
no assigned seating
flight attendants required to clean airplane
turnaround an aircraft in 15 minutes

$20?

"Break-Even Analysis": "Pick a price at which 
you can break even with load factor that you can 
reasonably expect to get within a short period of 
time…the price ought to be as low as you can get 
it without running out of money"

Was the BEQ of 39 passengers per flight 
realistic, given the current market? 

• What was the daily demand for flights between Dallas and Houston, 
prior to Southwest's entry? (see Exhibit 1)

•

•

(p. 4) Southwest scheduled called for 12 daily round trips between 
Dallas and Houston.  That's 24 flights.

(p. 5) break-even load requirements = 39

• What proportion of the current market would SWA have to capture? 

• Southwest needed to not only take share from competition, but to
expand primary demand. 

• To expand primary demand via price cuts, demand for air travel 
between Dallas and San Antonio needed to be price elastic.  Was it?

Was demand elastic with respect to price?

Radio ad for Southwest Airlines

• Southwest Airlines half-fare flights.   Every 
flight between San Antonio and Dallas every 
day.  Only $13

• [Irate Male Voice] "Hey! If you people fly 
Southwest Airlines during this half-price sale, 
you're gonna have a lonely bus driver on your 
conscience.  Take the bus.  It only costs a little 
more and is just 4 hours longer."

Pricing strategies: a timeline

• June 1971 SW Opens.  Introduces $20 flights 
• July, 1971 Braniff and TI reduce price to $20
• July, 1972 SW raises basic fare from $20 to $26, but  
flights after 9:00 p.m discounted to $10.
• July, 1972 Braniff and TI raise price to $26; Braniff adds 
a $10 flight to Houston after 7:30 p.m.
• January 22, 1973 Announces a "60-Day Half-Price Sale" 
on all flights between Dallas and San Antonio. 
• February 1, 1973.  Braniff announces 60 Day "Get 
Acquainted Sale" between Dallas and Houston (H).

How should Southwest respond to Braniff's 
move?   What are their alternatives?

What did Southwest do?

•

• Offered people a choice between the low fare $13 or the 
normal fare of $26.
If they paid the $26, they received a thank you gift.
– Liquor
– Ice bucket (for the Mormons who claimed they don't drink)
Initiated a PR campaign in which they accused Braniff of 
predatory pricing
• Reminded customers what service was like before SW. 

•

Postscript

• When Braniff's 60 day sale was over, they 
returned prices to $26.  So did Southwest.  
• In 1975, a federal grand jury indicted Braniff and 
TI for predatory pricing 
• Both Braniff and Texas International Airlines are 
now defunct
• Southwest worth more than all other airlines 
combined (11 Billion).
• Successful business model for the east coast?
– More weather related delays
– People not as friendly or fun loving
