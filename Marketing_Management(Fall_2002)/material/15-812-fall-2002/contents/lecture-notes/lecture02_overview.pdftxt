What are examples of good [bad] marketing?


GOOD 
•  Coca cola:  People buy more coke even though Pepsi tastes better. 
•  Pepsi cola:  Because it features Britney Spears 
•	 Mountain dew: Marketed the product from a “hillbilly” drink to a hip, youthful 
drink 
•  7 up: “Obey your thirst”, because it captures our desire to be individuals 
•  Absolute Vodka ads (???) 

BAD 
•  AMD commercial in the middle of a classic film segment 
•	 Commercials that don’t tell you what the product is (like the commercial 
where the cowboys are herding housecats) 
•	 Amazon’s commercial with a group of old people singing a boring song; [this 
conveys] the idea that the on-line buying experience is boring. 
•  Tobacco Advertising

Do people understand their own needs? 


•  What products are common today, that were unheard of 15 years ago? 

•	 Would a good market research company have been able to identify 
these unmet needs 15 years ago? 

Intuitions about people’s needs are often wrong 


“I think there’s a world market for about five computers.” 
(President of IBM, 1943) 

“TV won’t be able to hold on to any market it captures after the first 
six months.  People will soon get tired of staring at a plywood box 
every night.” 

(President of 20th  Century Fox, 1946)

Should consumers be followed or led?  


•	

“Our plan is to lead the public with new products rather than ask them 
what kind of products they want.  The public does not know what is 
possible, but we do.  So instead of doing a lot of market research, we 
…try to create a market for a product by educating [the public about 
what the product can do for them]. ” 

(Akio Morita, CEO of Sony)

3 conceptions of marketing


•	 The production concept:  consumers will buy goods that 
are widely available and inexpensive; focus is on 
improving efficiency in production & distribution 
•	 The selling concept:  consumers will not buy enough of 
your product if you leave them alone; focus on advertising 
& contact with potential customers 
•	 The marketing concept:  consumers will buy your products 
if you identify their needs & satisfy those needs better than 
competitors.
