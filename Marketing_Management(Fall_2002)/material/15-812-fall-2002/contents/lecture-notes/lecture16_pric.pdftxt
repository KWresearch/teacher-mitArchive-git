Price can dramatically affect profits


Annual demand = 1,000,000 units 

Production costs = $1.96 
Current price = $2 

Suppose you increased price by 1%


By what percentage would profits increase? ______%


The demand curve shows the relation 

between price and demand

lowering price to steal market share:

the effect on profits

Annual demand = 100 units

Market Share = 50%

Production costs = $1.60 
Current price = $2 

Suppose you decreased price by 10%

This caused Market share to increase by 20%

By what % would profits increase or decrease?

50 units at 40 cents profit per unit = $20

70 units at 20 cents profit per unit = $14


More examples of price discrimination 

•  “peak load pricing” 
•  scholarships 
•	 A 60 milligram capsule of Prilosec costs more than 
twice what a 30 milligram capsule costs 
•  Quote regular rate, followed by “special” rates 
•  Quantity discounts 
•  “Step” discounts 
•  Manipulating product design 

Product Line Pricing


•  Crest & Gleem 
•  Fresh & Day Old Croissants 
•  Pentium III and Pentium IV computers 

• "Bracketing the Competition":  Price one product line 
just above the competition and one just below it.  This 
gives the consumer little reason to buy the competitor.

Penetrating vs. Skimming a market 

•  Penetration Pricing:  low margin but high volume 
–  good if "economies of scale" in production costs 
–  capture a large share of the market (first mover advantage) 
–  dissuades entry (but easily copied unless you have prod. adv.) 
–  dangerous if there is a strong price-quality association 
limits flexibility because consumers react more strongly to price 
–	
increases than price decreases 

•  Skimming (Prestige Pricing):  high margins at expense of volume 
–	 good early in product life cycle, because "early adopters" are less 
price sensitive 
–  good if there is little risk of competition 
–  good if there is a strong price-quality association 
–  more flexibility because price can be reduced 

Some psychological pricing issues 

1.  Remember Prospect Theory

2.  Signaling value of sale signs

3.  Hedonic efficiency vs. Financial efficiency

4.  Worry about fairness

5.  Manage price expectations

6.  Encourage favorable comparisons 

7.  Discourage unfavorable comparisons

8.  Pennies a day 


Prospect Theory applied: 

“cash discount” or “credit card surcharge”?


Gas Station A:  Sells gasoline for $1.60 per gallon 
and gives a $0.10 per gallon discount if buyer 
pays with cash 

Gas Station B:  Sells gasoline for $1.50 per gallon 
and charges a $0.10 per gallon surcharge if buyer 
pays with a credit card 

Prospect Theory applied: 

“regular tuition” or “scholarship”?


College A:  Charges $10,000 a semester with 
a $5000 “scholarship” if you are in a price sensitive 
category 

College B:  Charges $5,000 a semester, with a 
$5000 surcharge if you are in a price insensitive 
category
