What is a "brand"? 


•	 Brand:  name, term, sign, symbol, or design intended to identify the 
products or services and to differentiate them from the products 
offered by competitors. 
•  Brand:  a psychological concept (or set of associations) 
•	 Brand(ing): The art of taking something common and improving 
on it in ways that make it more valuable and meaningful.

"A product is no more than an artifact around which consumers have 
experiences….Nike could have spent millions preaching the value of 
encapsulated gas trapped within a thin pliable membrane.  Instead it 
communicated what the product meant…it transcended the 
product…"Just Do It" was not about sneakers, it was about values… it 
tapped into the wide range of emotional rewards that are uniquely 
Scott Bedbury 
relevant to sports and fitness."

1974 To cut cost, they reduced 
brewing time from 12 days to 4; 
began using corn syrup instead of 
barley malt. 
Image problem caused a slight 
decline in sales 
1976 To combat declining sales 
began aggressive discounting 
•	 Caused people to think of it as cheap 
beer, and sales dropped more

Shakespeare 

"Shakespeare was wrong.  A rose by any other name would not smell as sweet 
… which is why the single most important decision in the marketing of 
perfume is the name."
