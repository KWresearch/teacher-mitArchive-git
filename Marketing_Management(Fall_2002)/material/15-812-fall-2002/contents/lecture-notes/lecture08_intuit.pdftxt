The future of Intuit….. 

•	 "We are remaking Intuit into something very different 
from what it once was.  Today, the company can be 
viewed in one of two ways – either as a successful 
established software company with a huge Internet upside, 
or as a fast-growing Internet company that, unlike most 
others, already has an established base of customers, a 
brand name, revenues, and cash flow."

Consider a bad experience that you have had with a product or 

service – could they have learned from Intuit?


Importance of psychology 

•	 "Consumer adoption is driven much more by an 
understanding of the customer's psychology than it is by 
technology.  The technology is there…..what's [usually] 
missing is an understanding of how customers actually 
think and work in this space and how to build something 
that gets customers to want to use it."

Yeltsin, Clinton and Bill Gates were invited to have dinner with

God.  During dinner God told them "I need three important figures to 

send my message out to all people.  Tomorrow I will destroy the 

earth".


Yeltsin immediately called together his cabinet and told them "I have 

two really bad news items for you:

1.God really exists and

2.Tomorrow God will destroy the earth".


Clinton called an Emergency meeting of the Senate and Congress 

and told them "I have Good news and Bad News:

1. God really does exist; 
2. The bad news is tomorrow God's destroying the earth". 

Bill Gates went back to Microsoft and happily announced "I have 
two fantastic announcements: 
1.  I'm one of the three most important people on earth and 
2.  The Year 2000 problem is solved".
