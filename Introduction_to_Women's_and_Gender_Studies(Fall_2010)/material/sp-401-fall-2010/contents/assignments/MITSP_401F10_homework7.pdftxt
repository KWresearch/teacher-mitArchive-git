Write about question 1, 5 and another question of your choice. All three questions 
(together) should be a page to a page and a half, typed, double-spaced. 
 
QUESTIONS: The Yellow Wallpaper- Charlotte Perkins Gilman 
 
     1. What connections do you see between Rosenberg’s article (“Hysterical Woman…”) and Gilman’s 
fictional story? 
 

2.  What are the possible meanings of the title and the color of the wallpaper? Why 
did Gilman use first person narration? Why is the female protagonist unnamed 
throughout the text? 

6.  Gilman was very much an activist writer and authored texts in many different 
voices (the social scientist, the journalist, the utopian writer, the Gothic writer). 
What is she advocating in this story? What are the risks of this narrative strategy 
for a politically oriented writer? 

 
      7.   What contemporary issues does The Yellow Wallpaper evoke? Why do you think 
it has become one of the five most popular readings in college courses in a variety of 
different disciplines? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

3.  How would you describe the narrator’s voice in this text? How does that voice 
evolve over the course of the novella?  How does the fragmented style of the 
narrative influence you as a reader? 

4.  How does Gilman engage with traditional ideas of femininity (the “cult of true 
womanhood”) and masculinity in this story? What do the house and wallpaper 
symbolize? What does the woman/women in the wallpaper represent? 

5.  What is the meaning of the last scene? Has this woman, through her madness, 
liberated herself as an individual from the control of her husband or has she 
experienced the ultimate victimization?
