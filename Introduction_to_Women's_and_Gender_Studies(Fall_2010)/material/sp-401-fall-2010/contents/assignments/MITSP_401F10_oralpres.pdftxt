Current Events Analysis Oral Presentation Guidelines: 15 minutes 

 
      The current events presentation fulfills the oral presentation requirement of a HASS 
CI class. Students will work in pairs to research and present an interpretation of a current 
events article of their choice pertaining to the topic of a given week. Your task is to 
connect concepts in an assigned reading(s) with an example from the news. This 
assignment requires critical and close reading of your news item. Present your analysis 
in a dynamic way to the class, along with several follow-up questions. Pay attention to 
how the topic is presented as well as the content of the article in your analysis. It may be 
helpful to allocate 8-10 minutes to your talk and 5-7 minutes for discussion/questions. 
     
 
Tips for topic/article selection: 
 

•  Consult the list for topic suggestions. You are not limited to these topics, but the 
list suggests possibilities. 

 
•  Be selective in your choice of article. Find one that is substantive but not 
excessively long or complicated. Avoid tabloids, entertainment publications, and 
web sources that lack credibility. Ask me if you are unsure of your choice. 

 

•  Think contemporary. While your news article doesn’t have to have been 
published in the week of the presentation, pick something written in the past year. 

 
Summarize and analyze. Make connections between the issue/event you have chosen 
and concepts/arguments from one or more readings for the week. 
 
Pose critical questions. Ideally, your presentation will lead us into a discussion of our 
topic. Strongly suggested: provide a handout or write key questions on the board.  
 
Images (optional). Some articles may include images to analyze or discuss. Plan ahead if 
you want to use the A-V equipment in the room (check if it’s working the day before you 
present) or bring photocopies so your classmates can see what you are analyzing.  
 
Preparation: By email, submit an outline/plan (co-authored) for your presentation a 
week before you are scheduled to present. 
 
Write-up. Submit a 2-3 page written analysis the class by one week after your 
presentation.Your analysis should include an overview of the content of your presentation 
and an analysis of the quality of your presentation. This can be a co-authored document. 
Grades will be based on the quality of the presentation and write-up.
