Homework Assignment: Write about Ques. 3, 5 and one other.                
             1.Why do you think that the filmmaker (Connie Field) selected these five women                 
to tell the story of U.S. women during World War II? 
 
              2.How did the needs of the defense economy during World War II  
                 contribute to a rethinking of biological essentialist arguments 
                 about “women’s place” and the nature of masculinity and femininity? 
 
               3.What is the effect of viewing the contrast between the government 
                   propaganda and the women’s lives? How does the filmmaker use voice- 
                  over? 
 
                4. How does the postwar conservative shift in gender roles affect these 
                   women? What is the meaning of their World War II experience? 
 
                5. What connections do you make between Friedan’s first chapter of The  
                    Feminine Mystique and the film?
