SP. 401                          Essay #2              Fall 2010 
 

 
Length: 5-7 pages, typed, double-spaced (Times, New Roman, 12pt.) 
 
      Choose ONE of the following topics and write a 5-7 page essay in response to it. You 
will need to draw specific examples from the texts we have read to support your points; 
use parenthetical citations to document the sources you use. Be sure that you are 
introducing your quotes adequately, creating smooth transitions between your own 
writing and that of your sources. Your essay should include a clear thesis statement in 
which you foreshadow your argument. Be sure to append to the essay a “Works Cited” 
page; see the course handout on citation (also on website) for assistance. 
 
1.  Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique and Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s The 
Yellow Wallpaper are widely considered classic texts in American feminism.  
Compare chapter 1 of The Feminine Mystique and The Yellow Wallpaper in terms 
of:  their ability to reflect upon life experience, their engagement with ideologies 
of domesticity and gender roles, their persuasive and literary power within their 
genres, and their visions of individual and social change. In the contemporary era, 
do either or both of these texts continue to have personal and political relevance?  
If “yes”, in what way?  If “no”, why not? 

 

2.  Analyze the gender socialization of a person in your age range that you know 
well, using the following approach. First, describe this individual’s future vision 
of life 15 years from now. In other words, how does this person project 
her/himself into the future?  Some issues to include: future occupation/profession,                               
personal life, core values. What does this person imagine as a future occupation?  
Does this individual see himself or herself living alone, with 
a spouse/partner, with extended family, having a child (ren)? What values (moral, 
social, religious) are most important in this person’s life? Your analysis will 
explain the origins of this individual’s future vision in past gender socialization: 
e.g., influences of parents and other significant adults, socialization “props” (e.g. 
books, toys, games), schooling (including MIT), influence of peers, etc.  Draw 
explicitly upon at least FOUR course readings that address issues of gender 
socialization (e.g., Friedan, Lorber, Thorne, Kimmel, Richardson); you are 
strongly encouraged to find another reading that speaks particularly to the 
experience of the person you are analyzing. Please note that your socialization 
analysis may fit some patterns described in the readings, and contradict 
others.  Your role as a writer is to incorporate the readings explicitly into 
your essay, even if you are analyzing a person whose life narrative 
contradicts some of the gender roles described in the readings. Also keep in 
mind that “socialization” cannot be reduced to “gender socialization” and that 
gender socialization interacts with ethnicity, race and class.  
If you choose to write about yourself, be sure to use a pseudonym!
