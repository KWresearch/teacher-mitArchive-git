“Love and Gold”- Arlie Russell Hochschild 
 
We will do some in-class writing on “Love and Gold” in response to these questions. 
 
1.“But if First World middle-class women are building careers that are molded according 
to the old male model, by putting in long hours at demanding jobs, their nannies and 
other domestic workers suffer a greatly exaggerated version of the same thing. Two 
women working for pay is not a bad idea. But two working mothers giving their all to 
work is a good idea gone haywire. In the end, both First and Third World women are 
small players in a larger economic game whose rules they have not written.”  
 
2.“The notion of extracting resources from the Third World harkens back to imperialism 
in its most literal form: the nineteenth century extraction of gold, ivory and rubber from 
the Third World….Today, as love and care become the “new gold”, the female part of the 
story has grown in prominence. In both cases, through the death or displacement of their 
parents, Third World children pay the price.”  
 
3.“On the one hand, the First World extracts love from the Third World. But what is 
being extracted is partly produced or “assembled” here: the leisure, the money, the 
ideology of the child, the intense loneliness and yearning for one’s own children.”  
 
4.“… migration creates not a white man’s burden but, through a series of invisible links, 
a dark child’s burden.”  
 
5..“Just as the market value of primary produce keeps the Third World low in the 
community of nations, so the low market value of care keeps the status of women who do 
it—and ultimately, all women—low.”
