LANGUAGE AND THE GENDERED ORDER 
Homework Assignment: Due Wed. 10/20; Suggested length: 1 -1 ½ pg, typed, double-
spaced 
 
Comment on two of these examples, drawing upon the Richardson and Lorber readings.  
Have these students/worker been treated fairly or unfairly? Do you see these incidents as 
disrupting or reinforcing the gendered scripts that Lorber describes?  
How do your answers reflect your sense of the importance of language usage and 
particular styles of verbal communication to gender equality? 
 

1.  A student turns in a literature paper in which she refers to the human race as 
“mankind” and individuals as “he”. The paper is returned with a failing grade 
because the student did not use inclusive language, as the professor had requested 
in the assignment prompt. 

 

 

2.  An editor at a publishing house includes in her assistant’s job evaluation a 
negative comment about her assistant’s refusal to use inclusive language (e.g. 
humans, he/she) in her prose. 

3.  A female student receives a low grade  for her political science oral presentation   
because, in the instructor’s words, “She uses typical unassertive female speech 
patterns and a deferential style.” When the student questions the grade, the 
instructor tells her that the low grade will benefit her because it will inspire her to 
be a more assertive speaker, which will help her not only in school, but also in her 
            future professional life.
