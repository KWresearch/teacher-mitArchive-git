AFFIRMATIVE ACTION EXERCISE: WRITE FOR FIVE MINUTES 
         Write in bullet points; use back if necessary. 
 
              A large financial services company with branches in Chicago, New York and 
Los Angeles analyzes its employment profile and finds that it has only 2% female 
representation in top managerial positions.  Analysis of population distribution and 
education trends reveals that the company could easily have 25% female representation in 
these top positions. The company sets a 5 year goal of “full utilization” for women in 
these positions at 25% and creates a plan to help meet this goal. 
        The Affirmative Action plan includes proactive hiring strategies such as advertising 
open positions to organizations of women in business and financial services, visually 
portraying the company as diverse in gender, racial and age representation, and 
networking with female leaders and mentors in the corporate world. 
               When a top management position comes open, the search committee reviews 
the applicant pool of over a hundred applicants, and interviews six candidates (two 
women, four men). The committee selects two final candidates, one male and one female. 
Both candidates have earned MBAs from prestigious schools, have ten years experience 
in the field, and have excellent recommendations from supervisors. After a second round 
of interviews, the search committee deems them equally qualified. However, under the 
Affirmative Action plan, the company offers the open position to the female candidate, 
who then accepts the job.  
         The company informs the male candidate in a letter that, although he was not 
chosen for this position, his resume will be kept on file should another opening occur. 
The male candidate decides to sue the company on the basis of “reverse discrimination”; 
he claims that one’s sex should play no role in hiring decisions. Furthermore, in an 
interview with the press, he states that that he personally is not sexist so he should not 
have to miss a lucrative job opportunity because of the “sins of the past.”   
         Who do you side with in this case—the company or the male candidate?  What 
issues about Affirmative Action are raised by this case? 
 
Note: Since employment decisions are highly confidential, the only ones who know that 
preferential hiring played a role in this hiring are the members of the search committee. 
Neither applicant knows if preferential hiring was used in deciding upon the successful 
job candidate.
