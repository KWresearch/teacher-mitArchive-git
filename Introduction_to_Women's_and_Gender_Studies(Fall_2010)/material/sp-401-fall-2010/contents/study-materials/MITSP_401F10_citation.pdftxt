SUGGESTED CITATION STYLE FOR ESSAYS 

SP. 401 
 
         In citing sources, you acknowledge writers whose ideas and words appear in your 
work, and guide readers to additional materials. Our suggested citation style is MLA 
(Modern Language Association); other styles (e.g., APA, Chicago Manual of Style) are 
also acceptable. MLA style uses in-text citation with a “Works Cited” page appended to 
essays. For information supplementing source citation, use footnotes. In footnoting, use a 
superscript number and place additional information at the end of the page. 1  There is no 
expectation to use footnotes; however, the option is available. Examples of MLA citation: 
 
1. Author named in sentence: In “The Declaration of Sentiments,” Elizabeth Cady 
Stanton critiqued the powerlessness of women in marriage: “He has made her, if married, 
in the eye of the law, civilly dead.”  
 
Note: Our copy of “The Declaration of Sentiments” has no page numbers, so 
naming the author in the sentence with quotation marks around the “sentiment” 
from the text is fine. For a document with page numbers, the sentence would look 
like this: 
In  “The Declaration of Sentiments,” Elizabeth Cady Stanton critiqued the powerlessness 
of women in marriage: “He has made her, if married, in the eye of the law, civilly dead” 
(1).   
  
2. Author Not Named in Sentence: “The Declaration of Sentiments” critiques the 
powerlessness of women in marriage: “He has made her, if married, in the eye of the law, 
civilly dead” (Stanton). 
 
With page numbers: “The Declaration of Sentiments” critiques the powerlessness of 
women in marriage: “He has made her, if married, in the eye of the law, civilly dead” 
(Stanton 1). 
 
WORKS CITED PAGE: Append a “Works Cited” page to the end of your essay. 
Examples: 
  
Article in an edited book: 
Truth, Sojourner, “Ain’t I a Woman?” Feminist Frontiers, 7th ed. Ed. Verta Taylor,  
       Nancy Whittier and Leila J. Rupp. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2007. 33.

1 Explanatory footnotes are useful in providing additional historical information that 
may be of interest to some readers or in explaining at more lengths terms that you use.
