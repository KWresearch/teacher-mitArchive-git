Ques. 2: Analysis of “Victor Smith” 
 
Working Thesis Statement:  Victor Smith, currently 22 years old and a senior at MIT, 
envisions himself in the future as a pediatrician, husband and father living with his wife 
and (hopefully) three children in a major city on the East Coast.  Influenced by parents 
playing traditional gender roles and a more egalitarian culture in high school and at MIT, 
Victor expresses significant conflict in his definition of manhood and his future vision of 
himself. 
 

1.  Future Vision and Background (1 pg.) 
V’s future vision of himself: Imagines himself as chief family breadwinner, 
but questions this role (why is he taking on so much stress? Why is he assuming 
that his female partner would not have the same aspirations as he?).  Aspires to 
be a pediatrician but some male peers react to this as a “woman’s job” and 
encourage him to pursue a more “manly” specialty within medicine. 

 
2.  Analyzing V’s Conflict 
      Influence of parents- traditional gender roles (Father worked 2 jobs—
carpenter/electrician, mother worked in the home raising 4 children). 
       Connection with readings: Lorber (idea of opposite gender roles, 
             gender as “taken for granted”), Friedan –The idea of domesticity 
  as women’s domain; parallel concept of a “masculine mystique”  
 
3.  Influence of other adults- teachers, personal physician (female pediatrician). 
Models of alternative masculinity: teacher who took a paternity leave, 
uncle who works as a day-care teacher. Strong female professional as a role 
model: his pediatrician.  
Connection with readings: Kimmel (on different models of masculinity) 
 
4.  Influence of MIT: overall culture of meritocracy, friends, professors, courses. 
Egalitarian models of gender: female peers and professors who have serious 
professional commitments as well as families. Current girlfriend does not want 
children because of her professional aspirations. Victor experiences conflict 
between his family as a role model and a more egalitarian lifestyle. 
Connections with readings: articles on women in science; reference to Stone-
Blackwell marriage contract. 
 
5.   Conclusion: Summarize analysis of V’s life and future vision; implications of 
this individual case.
