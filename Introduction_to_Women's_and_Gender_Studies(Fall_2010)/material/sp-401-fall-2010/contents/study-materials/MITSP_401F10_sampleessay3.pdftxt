Note: THIS IS A SAMPLE FIRST PARAGRAPH WRITTEN BY A STUDENT FOR A 
SIMILAR EXHIBIT ON MARRIAGE. THE SAMPLE ILLUSTRATES A TONE 
APPROPRIATE FOR A MUSEUM EXHIBIT.  HOWEVER, I DO NOT EXPECT YOU 
TO MODEL YOUR PROSE EXACTLY ON THIS PARAGRAPH. BELOW THE 
PARAGRAPH IS A LIST OF EXHIBIT ARTIFACTS. THE BOLDED SENTENCE IS 
A “MAPPING STATEMENT” OR “INFORMATIONAL THESIS STATEMENT”. 
 
 THE POLITICS OF MARRIAGE: A MUSEUM EXHIBIT  
 
           How do we view marriage—as a lifelong contract to stay together “in sickness and 
in health” or a more flexible commitment to remain wedded as “long as we both shall 
love”?  Do we envision marriage as including same-sex unions as well as partnerships 
between women and men?  Does marriage have a primary purpose such as the rearing of 
children or the happiness of the spouses?  How does the ideology of romantic love 
influence attitudes toward marriage and divorce? How does a “love marriage” contrast 
with an arranged marriage? This exhibit examines these and other questions through 
exploring the changing face of American marriage in light of transformations in: 
law and gender roles, marriage patterns, divorce rates and attitudes toward 
sexuality and same-sex unions.
