                Social Constructionism-  
                            transsexualism as a manifestation of: 
     (a) performative freedom in gender roles 
     (b) logical outcome of rigidly defined categories of 
           gender and sexual orientation 
     (c)  gender dysphoria—logical outcome of gender 
                                  stereotyping and homophobia- sense of 
                                  “being born into the wrong body” 
                            (d) Solutions to issue of extreme gender dysphoria— 
                                   social change, legal advocacy, counseling/therapy/education, 
                                   not surgery or hormonal treatment 
       
      b.   Psychiatric Definition of Gender Dysphoria/Transsexualism 
            (a) Deeply rooted psychic split between gender identity of the mind 
                  and body—clinically distinct from normal curiosity about the 
                  bodily differences between the sexes—source may be             
                   social/familial or biological 
             (b) Part of a spectrum of body dysmorphic disorders 
              (c) Not necessarily connected to other mental health issues  
              (d) Hormonal treatment and sex reassignment surgery treatment are  
                    effective in many cases 
               (e) Counseling post-surgery is often necessary to deal with trans- 
                      formations in individual identity and negative      
                      reactions/discrimination in various spheres of society. 

 
                     c. Biological Essentialism 
                   (a) Asserts idea of a core gender identity  
Sees transsexualism as caused by hormonal problems in fetal 
development resulting in a gender split between body/mind 
(b) Optimal treatment: hormonal, surgical
