 1920) for Women’s and Gender Studies 
 
The Yellow Wallpaper as a “bridging text” between 1st and 2nd Waves of American 
women’s rights activism 
 

a.  Critiquing the “Lenses of Gender”—(Sandra Bem) 
1.Biological Essentialism-The notion of gendered roles/hierarchy and male        
domination as rooted intrinsically in biology 
       2.Androcentrism (male-centeredness)- defines males and male experience 
as the norm and females and female experience as a deviation from that norm.  
       3 Gender polarization- assumes male and females are opposite in nature; 
             This lens may be superimposed on many aspects of dress, behavior, 
              work and sexuality. 
b.  Articulating a critique of the gender system as one of performance and 
power; Describing a model of a system in which the parts (social/cultural, 
legal/economic) work together to maintain a gendered hierarchy 
c.  Identifying contradictions within the political, economic and familial system 
to promote change 
d.  Establishing a model of social change that involved diverse methods,  
participants and goals: prefigurative and pragmatic approaches 
e.  Questions of the meaning of equality: sameness or difference? 
               f.    Creating connections and affirming differences among various subgroups of  
                      women; questions of theorizing race/gender/ethnicity
