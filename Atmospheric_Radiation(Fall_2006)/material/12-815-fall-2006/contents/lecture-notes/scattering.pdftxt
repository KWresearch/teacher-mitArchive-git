3. Scattering of Radiation by Molecules and Particles 

a. Introduction 
 
Here, we’ll deal with wave aspects of light rather than quantum aspects. 
 
Consider components of electric field in 2 mutually perpendicular directions, 
parallel and perpendicular to the plane of propagation and propagating in the z 
direction:

Let us first consider Single Scattering. We may consider a single particle or a 
small volume of particles such that scattering events will all be single scattering 
events.

 (cid:71)
P  is the phase matrix and provides the angular distribution and polarization of 
the scattered light. For our purpose here, lets consider the total intensity of the 
11p
radiation whether polarized or not. Then the term, 
, is the phase function or 
scattering diagram which defines the probability for scattering of unpolarized 
 is normalized such that:

 where α is the scattering angle (see Fig.

<cos α> = anisotropy parameter (or asymmetric parameter) and can vary 
between +1 and -1. <cos α> = 0  for isotropic scattering. 
 
We define analogous terms for particle absorption and we have:

This special case is valid for: 
 
(1)  randomly oriented particles, each of which has a plane of symmetry 
(2)  randomly oriented asymmetric particles, if half the particles are mirror 
images of the others. 
(3) Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering.

For water,  rn  = 1.33 across the visible and near infrared. And ni will depend on 
the kinds of materials dissolved in the water drops. It will therefore be much 
more of a function of wavelength. 
 
Returning to the analytical expression for the electric field as a beam of radiation 
passing through a single particle: 
 
 
 
The intensity of radiation varies as the square of the E-field. So, we have:

E(z, t) E e

Due to the complexities of evaluating the integrals in Eq. 4, a number of techniques 
have been used to generate numerical results: 
 

1.  Discrete Ordinates 
2.  Doubling or Adding Method 
3.  Successive Orders of Scattering 
4.  Iteration of Formal Solution 
5.  Invariant Embedding 
6.  Method of X and Y Functions 
7.  Spherical Harmonics Method 
8.  Expansion in Eigenfunctions 
9.  Monte Carlo Method 

 
We will focus some attention on the Discrete Ordinates Method and apply an 
available computer program to some exercises.

Let us now digress for a moment and examine the properties of Legendre 
polynomials (which come to play in a variety of ways in radiative transfer 
problems). 
 
We may consider writing the phase function in terms of Legendre polynomials 
in the form: 
 

P(cos α) = 

N
∑ (cid:65)

C P (cos )
(cid:65)
(cid:65)

properties:

In order to determine the unknown coefficients,  m
jL , aq, boundary conditions 
must be imposed. 
 
In the discrete-ordinates method for radiative transfer, analytical solutions for 
the diffuse intensity are explicitly given for any optical depth. Thus the 
internal radiation field can be evaluated without additional computational 
effort. And furthermore, useful approximations can be developed from this 
method for flux calculations. 
 
Advantages of Discrete Ordinate Method 
 

a)  In principle - numerical computations can be done for any order of 
approximation. 
b)  The internal radiation field is determined - not just the Reflection & 
Transmission. 
c)  Accurate results (to about 1%) are achievable with only a few streams 
(3-4) for most cases. 

We will utilize the Discrete Ordinate computer program to do a few 
excercises.

Multiple Scattering Computational Techniques 

1.  Discrete Ordinates (We’ll discuss in detail in a few minutes.) 
2.  Doubling or Adding 
Principle: If reflection and transmission is known for each of two layers, the 
reflection and transmission from the combined layer can be obtained by 
computing the successive reflections back and forth between the two layers. 
If the two layers are chosen to be identical, the results for a thick 
homogenous layer can be built up rapidly in a geometric (doubling) manner. 
3.  Successive Orders of Scattering 
Principle: Intensity is computed individually for photons scattered once, twice, 
three times, etc. with the total intensity obtained as the sum over all orders. 
If the intensity is expanded in a Fourier series, the high frequency terms arise 
from photons scattered a small number of times. Therefore, most Fourier 
terms can be obtained with some accuracy by computing a few orders of 
scattering. 
4.  Iteration of Formal Solution 
Direct solution of integral over source function by dividing atmosphere into 
layers with small optical thickness. 
5.  Invariant Imbedding 
Differential Equations are developed which give the change of reflection and 
transmission matrices when an optically thin layer is added to the atmosphere. 
It is a special case of the Doubling or Adding technique. 
6.  Method of X and Y Functions 
Involves the determination of integral equations for functions which depend 
upon only one angle and are directly related to Reflection and Transmission 
matrices. The integral equations need to be solved numerically. The integral 
equations are completely specified by a character function depending on the 
particular phase function. This method is due to Chandrasekhar. 
7.  Spherical Harmonic Method 
Intensity is immediately expanded into a finite number of spherical harmonics 
and then the Phase Function is expanded in Legendre polynomials similar to 
the Discrete Ordinate method. 
8.  Expansion in Eigenfunctions 
Standard technique for solving differential equations. Find homogenous 
solution and particular solution. Apply boundary condition. Direct application 
to complete RTE is ponderous. Discrete Ordinates technique depends on this 
approach for solving discretized set of equations. 
9.  Monte Carlo Method 
Scattering of an individual photon can be considered to be a stochastic 
process, with the Phase Function being the probability density function for 
scattering at a given angle. Photons are allowed to play a game of chance in a 
computer and by recording the history of a sufficient number of photons, the 
radiation field can in principle be determined to an arbitrary accuracy. The 
basic simplicity of this method allows great flexibility, and hence it can be 
applied to complicated problems which would be virtually insoluble by other 
methods.
