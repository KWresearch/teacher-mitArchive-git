ENERGY BALANCE IN THE CLIMATE SYSTEM

WHAT ARE THE VERTICAL FLOWS OF ENERGY
THAT DETERMINE GLOBAL TEMPERATURES?

THE FUNDAMENTAL UNITS WE  WILL USE
TO MEASURE FLOWS ARE WATTS/(METER)2

HUMAN & OTHER INFLUENCES ON CLIMATE

HOW IS THE COMPOSITION OF THE 
ATMOSPHERE CHANGING?

HOW HAVE THE ENERGY FLOWS
CHANGED SINCE PRE-INDUSTRIAL TIMES?

RADIATIVE FORCING (watt/m2) IS THE CHANGE 
IN THE VERTICAL ENERGY FLOW 
(at the tropopause) INDUCED BY CHANGES
IN GREENHOUSE GASES, AEROSOLS, 
& OTHER CLIMATE FORCING PROCESSES

ACTIVITIES FORCING CLIMATE CHANGE
IN THE INDUSTRIAL ERA (1850-2000)?
