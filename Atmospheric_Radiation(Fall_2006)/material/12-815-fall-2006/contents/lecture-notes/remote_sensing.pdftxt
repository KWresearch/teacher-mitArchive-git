4. Remote Sensing 
 
A. Introduction 
 
Electromagnetic waves, interacting with a medium leave a signature dependent on the 
composition and thermal structure of the medium. 
 
Let M=Medium and S=Signal respectively. Then, we have: 
 
 
 
Where F represents a function that is not necessarily linear. The function will generally relate to 
absorption, scattering, emission and polarization. In turn, absorption and scattering will depend 
on composition (molecular and particulate) and emission will depend on composition and 
temperature. Polarization will depend on scattering properties including the size, shape and 
orientation of particulates. 
 
The inverse of Eq. 1 gives: 
 
 
 
Where F-1 represents the inverse of the function F. 
 
A fundamental obstacle in all inverse problems of remote sensing is the uniqueness of solution. 
The non-uniqueness arises because the medium under investigation may be composed of a 
number of unknown parameters whose various physical combinations may lead to the same 
radiation signature. There are also mathematical problems associated with the stability of 
solution. 
 
We will need to consider both active and passive remote sensing: 
 
Active Remote Sensing uses a radiation source generated by artificial means – e.g., lasers used 
for LIDAR or microwaves used in RADAR. Generally a beam of radiation is sent out and a back-
scattered signal is measured, although it would also be possible to have the source and receiver 
located at different places. Range-gating enables the user to determine the location of 
scatterers. 
 
Passive Remote Sensing uses natural radiation sources such as the sun or the emission of the 
earth and atmosphere itself. Thus, wavelengths of the solar spectrum from the UV to the IR are 
accessible and thermal emission by the earth atmosphere system is available from about 4 μm 
to the far infrared and microwave region. 
 
B. Scattered Sunlight as a Means of Remote Sensing 
 
Consider sunlight incident on the top of the atmosphere with a measurement system located at 
the earth’s surface. We have:

where we have introduced the optical depths associated with Rayleigh and Mie extinctions as τR 
and τM respectively. 
 
Let us consider the example of seeking the total ozone concentration in the atmosphere so that 
k(λ) is the absorption coefficient due to ozone at wavelength λ and ρ(λ) is the density of ozone 
at altitude z. The total ozone concentration will then be:

Let us also simplify our problem by recognizing that ozone is concentrated in a layer centered 
near 22 km, so we can set θo = Z where Z = the solar zenith angle at 22 km. Otherwise, we’ll 
use m = sec θo. 
 
If we now select two wavelengths (λ1 and λ2) in the Hartley-Huggins ozone absorption band 
where there is little absorption by other atmospheric molecules and if we assume that the 
aerosol optical depths are about the same at these two wavelengths we can evaluate Eq. 4 for 
each wavelength. Subtracting the equation for λ2 from the equation for λ1 then enables a 
solution for Ω.

The determination of this quantity is routinely measured via a standard instrument known as a

Turbidity Detection
 
Turbidity is a measurement of atmospheric aerosols, both natural and manmade. Let us write 
Eq. 3 for the situation where molecular absorption is ∼ 0. The solution of Eq. 4 then becomes:

Water Vapor Determination
 
Measurement of incoming solar flux at two wavelengths in a near infrared water vapor band can 
be used to determine the total amount of precipitable water in the path from sun to ground. In 
this case, Eq. 4 outside of the water band becomes:

Reflected Sunlight
 
Extinction can also be used to determine the amount of an absorbing gas in the atmosphere by 
making measurements at two wavelengths, appropriately spaced in an absorption band and 
outside of the absorption band. However, in this case we will consider the scenario of a satellite 
θs
viewing the earth at the angle 
 whereas the sunlight is incident on the atmosphere at angle 
θo
. The solution to Eq. 3 now requires slight modification as indicated in Eq. 12:

Remote Sensing of Cloud Optical Depth and Particle Size 
 
1.  Cloud covers more than 50% of the earth. 
 
2.  Many variables involved: 
 
a) Particle size distribution 
b) Complex index of refraction 
c) Particle phase 
d) Particle shapes 
e) Cloud optical depth 
 
3.  Some General Principles: 
 
a) Reflection from clouds at a wavelength with little absorption (e.g. – visible wavelength) is 
primarily a function of their optical depth. 
 
b) Reflection from clouds in the near infrared is largely dependent on particle size. 
 
c) The measurement of polarization represents an additional technique for separating the 
several variables associated with the scattered radiation field.

Summary
 

1.  The upwelling radiance has 2 components 
a) Surface term 
b) Atmospheric term 
 
2.  Temperature information is included in the Planck function whereas, absorbing gas 
profile information is included in the atmospheric transmission. 
 
3.  Observed radiances relate in a complex and inter-related way to the temperature and 
molecular constituent profiles in the atmosphere.

Redundancy – because each spectral radiance measurement comes from a range of 
altitude, we can get redundancy. 
 
D. Temperature Sounding using the 15 μm CO2 Band 
 
Let us specialize our problem to temperature sounding and the use of a CO2 band for this 
purpose. And let us assume a spectral measurement over a 10 cm-1 bandpass. We can 
reasonably assume that carbon dioxide is uniformly mixed in the atmosphere in the altitude 
regime we’re interested in (0-40 km). This means that

let us define a weighting function as

similar to z. And let us consider vertical viewing so we can for now ignore the  μ  dependence. 
 
In order for the average transmission over 10 cm-1 to be significant (say transmission between 
0.1 and 0.9), individual absorption lines will generally be completely absorbed at their centers 
and can be associated with the limiting case of strong absorption. As we showed earlier (See 
MODTRAN Lecture notes), for this

E. Retrieval of Atmospheric Temperature Profiles 
 

a)  Direct Inversion 

 

 

We can invert the radiative transfer equation directly in the following manner. In the 11 
μm “window”, 85% of observed intensity is from the ground (depending on atmospheric 
humidity). Use an initial guess profile 
pT , to obtain Ts:

t Δν  which is not available from first principles (due to a lack of knowledge of atmospheric

our efforts to retrieve the temperature profile by direct inversion will likely result in 
failure.

F. Remote Sensing Exercise 
 
A 2-part Remote Sensing Exercise will be handed out here. The first part deals with 
temperature retrieval by empirical regression. The second part asks you to again use the 
MODTRAN code to examine weighting functions in the 15 μm band of CO2 and use the 
information to design a system for temperature sounding. 
 
 
G. Temperature Retrieval Based on Iteration 
 
The retrieval procedures we’ve discussed so far are linear and empirical. The problem we face 
here is that the radiative transfer equation (a Fredholm equation with fixed limits) may not 
always have a solution. The radiances contain experimental uncertainty and so do the 
calculated transmission results. Furthermore, it is necessary to approximate the integral by a 
sum, again introducing errors in the computed radiances. 
 
We should instead consider a non-linear approach. Re-writing the solution to the equation of 
radiative transfer, we have:

Using the mean value theorem, the radiance can be approximated by Eq. 29.

This approach was pioneered by M. Chahine and is referred to as the relaxation equation. A 
number of variants of this procedure have been developed and are used operationally today. 
 
Here is the recipe for applying this kind of procedure. The quantity, n, is used here to represent 
the order of iteration. 
 
1.  Make an initial guess for the temperature profile: 
 
2.  Substitute T(n) into Eq. 28 and use an accurate quadrature formula to compute the expected 
( )n
upwelling radiance 
 for each sounding channel.

3.  Compare the computed radiance values

T(n) is a solution. If not, continue the iteration. 
 
4.  Apply the relaxation equation (Eq. 32) M (where M = number of spectral channels, and we 
have the same number of pressure levels as spectral channels) times to generate a new 
guess for the temperature values T(n+1)(pi) at the selected i pressure levels, i.e., force the 
temperature profile to match the observed radiances.  
 
Since the Planck function can be written as Eq. 33 with a = 2hc2 and b= hc/k 
 

 are less than a preset small value (e.g., 10-4) for each sounding channel, then

5.  Carry out the interpolation between the temperature value at each given level, pi, to obtain 
the desired profile. 
 
6.  Finally, go back to step 2 and repeat until the residuals are less than the preset criterion. 
 
 
How well will the relaxation method converge to the correct solution? Or will it fail to converge? 
A variety of testing has led to variants of this procedure that are used in practice.

If the temperature profile has been retrieved through measurements in one of the CO2 bands, 
then the remaining unknown is the transmission. We can then select spectral channels in an 
appropriate water vapor absorption band (e.g. – the 6.3 micrometer vibration-rotation band) 
and attempt to retrieve the concentration of water along the path. 
 
Empirical procedures have been used with some success and more recently, iterative 
procedures are being applied. However, the accuracy of retrieval is poorer than for temperature 
retrieval and is generally in the range of 10-20%. Higher spectral resolution measurements of 
the future are thought to enable measurements somewhat better than 10%.

1.  Useful for measuring trace constituent profiles of the middle atmosphere 10 ≤ Z ≤ 60 km. 
 
2.  Can look at transmission (absorption) or emission. Transmission measurements are limited 
by availability of the sun and so only occasional occultations are observed. 
 
3.  Emission measurements (in thermal infrared) can be made any time of day or night. 
 
a) Emission originates in the few km immediately above tangent point due to rapid decrease 
of atmospheric density and pressure. This, coupled with low-altitude cut-off leads to an 
inherent high vertical resolution of measurement. 
 
b) All radiation comes solely from atmosphere – no surface boundary contribution. 
 
c) Horizontal (tangent) path leads to high opacity (x37). Thus, it is good for minor gas 
detection. 
 
d) Disadvantages: 1) High clouds; and 2) Horizontal region sounded is large (~ 100-200 
km).

For determining gaseous composition as a function of height (z), we must change variable from 
x to z (using spherical geometry). We then have:
