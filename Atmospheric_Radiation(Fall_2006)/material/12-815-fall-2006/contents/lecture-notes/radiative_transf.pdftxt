In an interval ds, we lose intensity by extinction (scattering and absorption) and gain it by 
emission and scattering. 
 
Lambert’s Law: The extinction process is linear, independently in the intensity of radiation and 
in the amount of matter, provided that the physical state (i.e. temperature, pressure, 
composition) is held constant. 
 
From Lambert’s Law, the change of intensity along a path ds is proportional to the amount of 
matter in the path and to the intensity of radiation:

The argument that the extinction process is linear in the amount of matter applies with equal 
force to the emission process. Therefore, we write: 
 
 
 
where we have defined the source function,  Jν . 
 
The extinction coefficient can be expressed as the sum of an absorption coefficient  (
scattering coefficient  (

Let us also be reminded that the atmosphere in general contains both gases and particulates 
(aerosols). Each has scattering and absorption properties that we need to consider. Thus we

There are many cases where the physical situation enables the neglect of one or more of these 
terms and a related simplification of the Radiative Transfer Equation. We will now examine a 
few such cases. 
 
Let us first apply Kirchoff’s Law to our Radiative Transfer Equation. “The ratio of emission and 
fractional absorption in any direction of a slab of any thickness in thermodynamic equilibrium 
equals the black body intensity.” So – in a non-scattering atmosphere, we have

A lot of work has been done to develop methods for computing this mean transmission and we

Case II:
 
Let us consider a cloudless atmosphere and the infrared portion of the electromagnetic 
spectrum. Due to the approximate separation of the solar emission spectrum and planetary 
emission spectrum (as discussed previously by Prof. Prinn), we now have:

Lets consider the upward intensity at a level, z (μ > 0). The origin of optical depth is at the top 
of the atmosphere and we will need to integrate from the level, z, to the surface. It is therefore 
convenient to change the variable of integration to 
'τ = τ − τ  as we must integrate over optical 
z
depths ranging from zero to the optical depth at the surface of the earth. Thus, we have Eq.

In these equations we’ve dropped the frequency specification for simplification. But – we’ll need 
to keep in mind that optical depth, Planck function and radiation intensity always depend on 
frequency (or wavelength). 
 
If the temperature is known throughout the atmosphere, an exact solution is possible: i.e. –

The solution to this problem requires knowledge of the distribution of scatterers, the optical 
properties of the scatterers and their Phase Function (the probability that a photon incident 
from a particular direction will be scattered into another specific direction). In general, we must 
also deal with the complex problem of multiple scattering. We’ll investigate the process of Mie 
Scattering and Absorption by spherical particles, having specified sizes and optical properties. 
We’ll use a computer program that provides exact solutions for Mie Scattering and Absorption. 
Then, we’ll be dealing with a computer model capable of computing the radiation field for 
multiple scattering, using a procedure known as Discrete Ordinates which divides the radiation 
field into Fourier components and integrates the set of independent equations using Gaussian 
quadrature. 
 
 
2. Radiation Intensity and Radiation Flux 
 

a.  Radiation Intensity – amount of energy per unit time contained in an element of solid 
angle which flows through a cross section of unit area perpendicular to the direction of 
the beam. 
 
Let us consider that we have isotropic radiation of intensity Io falling on one face of a 
horizontal slab:

For Isotropic Radiation, the flux is π times the intensity of a straight beam.
 
Applications using Radiation Intensity 
1.  Remote sounding 
2.  Satellite measurements 
3.  Target detection over horizontal/vertical paths 

 
Applications using Flux: 
1.  Heating/Cooling of atmosphere 
2.  Radiation effects on climate.
