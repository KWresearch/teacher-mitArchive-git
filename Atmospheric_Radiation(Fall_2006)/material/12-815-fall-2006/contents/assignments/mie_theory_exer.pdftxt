Mie Scattering Program: The Mie scattering program calculates quantities such 
as the single scattering albedo a and the asymmetry parameter g. the program 
outputs columns of numbers that can be plotted using standard plotting routines. 
To obtain the program and the necessary documentation, follow the steps 
outlined in detailed instructions. After these steps have been followed, you should 
have seven files in a directory called Mie. The file descriptions are: 
 
(1) Compile_Run describes the process of compiling and running the source code 
for the exercise. 
(2) MIEV.doc is the documentation for the Mie scattering code. This is 
recommended reading. 
(3) MIEV0.f is the main subroutine which the user calls.  
(4) ErrPack.f is a set of 4 error-handling routines needed by MIEV0.f.  
(5) qscat.f is the driver for exercise 2.  
(6) phs_fnc.f is the driver for exercise 3.  
(7) g.f is the driver for exercise 4. 

 
 

Only minor modifications to the drivers are required for the exercises. The 
important driver inputs are: 
(1) XX is the Mie size parameter.  
(2) CREFIN is the complex index of refraction.  
(3) NUMANG is the number of angles at which quantities are output.  
(4) XMU(N) is the array of the cosines of the angles at which quantities are 
output. 

 
The important output quantities are:  
(1) QEXT is the extinction efficiency. 
(2) QSCA is the scattering efficiency.  
(3) GQSC is the asymmetry parameter times QSCA.  
(4) S1 and S2 are the Mie scattering amplitudes, and are related to the 
normalized phase function P by the following: 

P = (4/XX2QSCA) (|S1|2 + |S2|2)/2

Exercise 2 Calculate and plot Qscat, Qabs, Qext, and a (where a = single scattering

Qscat curves in light of the van der Hulst theory of anomalous diffraction. Why does 
the large-scale oscillatory structure disappear as  ′%n → 1? Why does the asymptotic 
value of Qscat for large x go from ~2 to ~1 as  ′%n  goes from 10-3 to 1? Explain the 
trend of the single scattering albedo as a function of  ′%n  for x = 100?

in the output, they are due to resonances.
