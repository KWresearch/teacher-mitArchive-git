Problem Set #4 
Due: Tuesday, April 15 by 5:00 PM 

1.  A  non-planar  dislocation  loop  is  shown  in  the  diagram  below.	 Each  of  the  dislocation  seg­
ments  lies  parallel  to  one  of  the  coordinate  axes.  The  segment  AB  is  a  left-handed  screw 
dislocation. 

(a)  Identify  the  character  (positive  edge,  negative  edge,  right-handed  screw  (RHS),  left-
handed screw (LHS)) of each segment of the dislocation loop. 

Solution:  Since  we  are  told  AB  is  LHS,  we  know  the  burgers  vector  b  is  parallel  to 
the  line vector s but  in an opposite direction.  This sets s  for  the other segements  in  the 
loop;  it  goes  counterclockwise  around  the  loop.  The  burgers  vector  for  the  loop  does 
not  change.  This  gives  The  convention  for  a  positive  and  negative  edge  dislocation  is

arbitrary  in  any  real  sense;  we  can  choose  to  deﬁne  a  positive  edge  with  a  Burgers 
vector  to  the  right  for a dislocation  line direction  into  the page,  but we  cannot  choose 
to  make  these  vectors  non-orthogonal  (that  is  the  deﬁning  property  of  the  edge  dislo­
cation).  Which  ones  you  choose  to  call  positive  and  negative  are  immaterial,  as  long 
as  you  recognize  that  DE  and  GH  are  opposite;  and  BC  and  HA  are  the  same  and 
opposite from DE and FG. 
(b)  A positive shear stress τzx  = τxz  is applied.  Indicate the direction of the Peach-Koehler 
force for each segment, and list those segments for which the force is zero.

Let’s  look at BC which has a  line  vector  ζ  =  [100]¯

So  there are no  forces acting on BC due  to  the applied  stress  state.  If we do a  similar 
analysis for DE, FG, and HA we ﬁnd that these segments also experience no force.

Therefore  the  force  acting  on  this  segment  is  in  the  negative  y-direction.  A  similar

2.  Solute strengthening includes a point defect-based obstacle to dislocation motion, where this 
obstacle  is an  impurity or solute atom  in  the ”host” or ”matrix” crystal  lattice.  Those  taking 
3.21 in parallel have already considered the equilibrium situation of a solute atom interacting 
with  an  edge  dislocation  self-stress  ﬁeld  (Ballufﬁ,  Allen  &  Carter,  Kinetics  of  Materials; 
Section 3.5.2). Here, we will continue the kinetic consequences of this analysis. 

(a)  Assume  a  point  defect  to  be  well-represented  by  an  elastic  sphere  of  effective  radius 
r(1 + δ),  where  r  is  the  radius  of  the  host  lattice  (or  matrix)  atom  and  δ  is  the  posi­
tive/negative difference between the solute and matrix atomic radii.  Note that δ  is pos­
itive if the solute atom exceeds the host atom in size; and negative if the solute atom is

smaller. Assuming the atomic size mismatch is sufﬁciently small, let the solute atom be 
a substitutional  impurity  in  the  lattice,  and express  the change  in volume at  that  lattice 
site ΔV  due to replacing a lattice vacancy (the volume of the missing atom in the host 
lattice) with a solute atom, in terms of the solute atom radius and induced strain �. 

4 πr3  and  the  volume  of  the  solute  atom  is 
Solution:  The  volume  of  the  vacancy  is  3
4 πr3 (1 + δ)3 .  In this case, δ  is the strain due to putting an atom in the vacancy �.  The 
3 
change in volume is thus written as 

ΔV  =

3 πr3 (1 + �)3  − 
3 πr3 
Because � is small, higher order terms from the expansion of (1 + �)3  will be negligible 
and we can write 

4
ΔV  =  πr3 �

(b)  Cottrell considered  the equilibrium position or “atmosphere” of  the solute atom due  to 
the  self-stress  of  a  dislocation,  as  a  function  of  distance  from  the  dislocation  core.  In 
general,  the  elastic  strain  energy  Ue  of  the  crystal  increases  as  a  pΔV  term,  where  p 
is  equal  to  the  hydrostatic  stress  acting  on  that  point-defected  volume ΔV .  Using  the 
elastic solutions to dislocation self-stress and the deﬁnition of hydrostatic stress, graph 
the hydrostatic isostress contours as a function of (x, y) or (r, θ) distance around both an 
edge dislocation core and around a screw dislocation core.  (Mathematica, Matlab, etc. 
are handy rendering programs for analytical equations.)  Here, you can use the required 
structural and elastic  constants  for bcc  (also called α-phase) Fe.  Cottrell combined  all 
these  structural/elastic  terms  into  a  constant,  such  that  Ue  was  reduced  to  a  material-
dependent constant modifying a dependence on just θ! and r . 

Solution:  The elastic strain energy normalized by line length L is

For a screw dislocation, Ue/L = 0 because there is no hydrostatic component in its self 
energy.  In the case of an edge dislocation however, we substitute the hydrostatic stress

Although  we  can  plot  the  elastic  strain  energy  in  a  cartesian  coordinate  system  using

Writing it in this way, we condense all the material parameters in the factor K  and can 
therefore  calculate  the  elastic  strain  energy  at  any  point  (r,θ)  around  the  dislocation 
core. For Fe, G ∼ 70 GPa, b ∼ 0.3 nm, ν  ∼ 0.3, r ∼ 0.15 nm, and

=  0.43, 

making k = 1.4 × 10−29  N m2 .  The graph of the hydrostatic isostress contours around 
an edge dislocation  is shown  in Hull and Bacon, Fig.  10.11 very schematically (this  is 
the ﬁg reproduced in KOM), and the normal stress component σzz  is shown in Hull and 
Bacon, Fig.  9.10 
(c)  From  the above graphs,  show  the most energetically stable  location of a smaller solute 
atom like C in terms of θ , the angular position deﬁned by your coordinate system at the 
edge and screw dislocation cores.  (Aside: Note that the above analysis was for a substi­
tutional atom, but C is in fact an interstitial defect in Fe;  this point is usually neglected 
in analysis of point-line defect interactions, but does affect the number of lattice points 
available to both species.) 

Solution: A small atom like C is stable at (0,-b) (below the dislocation core) because the 
largest tensile stress state is located there.  The C atom, which has a compressive stress 
state associated with it, can reduce the energy of the system by moving to this position. 

(d)  The equilibrium or steady-state concentration of solute atoms as a function of distance 
from the dislocation core can be predicted from thermodynamics, based on an Arrhenius 
dependence  on  the  core-distance-dependent  energy  barrier Ue .  Predict  this  concentra­
tion  at  a  location  (0,  -b)  from  the  core  of  a  positive  edge  dislocation  in  Fe  at  room 
temperature  (300 K), assuming  that  the concentration of C solute  far  from  the disloca­
tion  is  0.1%  and  that  the  binding  energy  of  C  to  the  edge  dislocation  core  is  0.5  eV. 
Explain implications in terms of distribution of the C solute within the Fe lattice. 

Solution:  An Arrhenius  relationship  for  the  steady-state  concentration  gradient  based 
on the energy barrier Ue  (we are now ignoring writing the L and calling this the elastic

(given as 300 K), and kB  is Boltzmann’s constant. At (0,-b) 
Ue  = 10−29  sin(0)  = 0

Therefore,  c(0, −b) =  c  = 0.001,  which  implies  that  all  the  carbon  will  be  at  the

dislocation  core  (which  is  given  by  (0,-b)).  This  is  nonsensical.  Suppose  instead  that

which gives us c = 3.6 × 10−7  = 3.5 × 10−5%.  This means that all the carbon atoms 
are not actually at the dislocations, or stated another way, only a fraction of the carbon 
atoms are at the dislocation core. 

(e)  Cottrell considered these interactions even before dislocations were observed, so he an­
alyzed the effect of any applied pressure on the solute atom. Use Peach-Koehler to take 
the  opposite  view:  What  is  the  driving  force  for  glide  and/or  climb  due  to  the  hydro­
static pressure created by  the solute atom  that  is  located at (0,  -b) from a positive edge 
dislocation core and from a positive screw dislocation core?

In  the  case  of  a  screw  dislocation,  we  can  say  ζ  =  [100]  and  b  =  [100].  With  the 
same Σ¯ as above, we ﬁnd that all forces are zero. 

(f)  Now  as  the  dislocation  glides  under  applied  shear  stress  on  its  slip  plane,  the  role  of 
C  in  solute  strengthening  depends  on  a  competition  between  solute  diffusion  (keep­
ing  up  with  the  core)  and  maintained  dislocation  velocity.  For  example,  if  diffusion 
times/distances  are  comparable  to  glide  times/distances,  the  C  will  keep  up  with  the 
core  and  continue  to  impede  glide.  This  is  called  dynamic  strain  aging,  and  leads  to 
serrated  yielding  in  unaxial  tension  (stress  above  yield  point  dropping  as  dislocations 
break free of solute; and increasing as solute diffuses back to the core).  How fast/far is 
that?  Here, we make analogy to Cottrell’s classic strain aging argument, which showed 
scaling between  the time required for a moving solute atom  to diffuse into a stationary 
dislocation core  (opposite case  to our dynamic  strain aging),  show how  the concentra­
tion  or  number  of  solute  atom  obstacles  at  the  bcc  Fe  dislocation  core  depends  on  the 
diffusion time t of the C solute (see BAC’s KoM). Then compare this time for a solute 
atom to diffuse a distance |b| with the time it takes for a dislocation to move a distance 
|b| for a typical metal (see your Orowan strain rate solution from PS3). 

Solution:  See KoM pg.  73 Ex 3.9, which gives a development of these equations based 
on our stated assumptions.  You can reproduce this series of steps, but the point here is 
to translate the symbols and terms into those we’ve used in 3.22 so that you can be sure 
you understand the result in both contexts (one with an emphasis on kinetics,  the other 
with an emphasis on mechanics). 

The  key  result  is  that  carbon  diffuses  along  tangents  to  the  isostress  contours  around 
the  dislocation  –  a  roughly  circular  loop  that  is  everywhere  tangent  to  the  isostress 
lines.  This results in a velocity v related to the diffusion distance R by 

v ∼

R2 

Therefore,  the  diffusion  time  is  simply  the  diffusion  distance  2πR  around  that  tangent 
contour, or 
2πR

To determine a glide time, we can recall from PS3 that typical dislocation velocities are 
10 cm/s, so for a glide distance of one Burgers vector = 0.3 nm (estimate), t = b/v = 3 
ns. 

To  determine  a  diffusion  time,  we  could  assume  steady-state  diffusion  such  that  t  = 
x2/4D , where x  is diffusion distance of one Burgers  vector and D  is  the diffusivity of 
C  in bcc Fe.  This has been  tabulated  in  various papers and  textbooks;  I adopt  the  ex­
pression  listed  in Tibbets, J. Appl.  Phys.  51:  4813 (1980), which I  found via a Google 
Scholar search and then conﬁrmed on the journal site: D = 0.47exp(−1.6C )exp([−37, 000−
6600C ]/RT )cm2/sec where C  is  at.%  carbon.  Then  for  b =  0.3  nm  (an  estimate),  T 
=  300  K  (room  temp),  and  0.1  at.%C  (given),  D  =  1.8x10−28 cm2/s,  and  thus  t  = 
2.9x1011s.  This  is  a  very  long  time,  in  fact  it  would  require  precisely  9218  years  to 
attain  this  diffusion  distance  at  room  temperature.  Indeed,  we  need  to  deform materi­
als like this simple steel at temperatures T  ∼ Tmelt  to observe this dynamic strain aging. 

The  temporal  mismatch  between  glide  and  diffusion  at  room  temp  here  is  real,  and 
underscores the strong Arrhenius dependence of diffusion required for serrated yielding 
and dynamic strain aging to be observable. 

3.  We discussed how two edge dislocations could intersect, resulting in an edge-type jog in one

of them.  Show whether it is possible for pure (edge or screw) dislocations to intersect in such

a way that would result in formation of a sessile kink in either of the two dislocations.  These

could be two edges, two screws, or one edge/one screw.


Solution:  See  ﬁgure  below  (note  that  s  represents  the  line  vector  ζ ).  When  the  edge  and 
screw dislocations intersect, a jog with edge character and length |bS | is created in the edge 
dislocation. A kink is created in the screw dislocation with edge character and length |be |.  If 
a stress is applied that moves the screw dislocation in its original slip plane, that same stress 
will  cause  the  edge-character  kink  to move  in  the  same  slip  plane.  Therefore  the  kink  does 
not make the dislocation (with the kink) sessile.  However, if the screw components cross-slip 
to another slip plane, the kink will become a jog and make the dislocation sessile. We should 
this in recitation.

4.  You are given an Al- 2 at.% Cu alloy where the Cu is in solution with the Al.  Your boss then 
asks you to make the material as strong as possible. 

(a)  Before  you  do  anything  to  the  material,  ﬁrst  estimate  the  amount  of  solute  (in  at.%) 
necessary to put one solute atom at each site along all of the dislocations in the sample. 
This will give you an idea of how much solute is necessary to strengthen the material by 
solute alone. 

Solution:  Assume  that  1  mm3  of  well  annealed  metal  contains  about  106  mm  of  dis­
location per line length.  In 1 mm3  of Al (FCC with a lattice parameter a � 4 ˚A), there 
�
� 
are 
10−3  m 
3
4 atoms × 
4 × 10−10  m 
Next  we  must  calculate  the  spacing  between  adjacent  atoms  on  one  edge  dislocation. 
The closest spacing is a/2 = 2  ˚A. Therefore on 106  mm of dislocation line there are 

= 6.3 × 1019  atoms

= 5 × 1012  atoms 

106  mm 
2 × 10−10  m/atom 
The composition is therefore 
5 × 1012  solute atoms  = 10−7 
6.3 × 1019  total atoms 
or 10−5%. Note that anything similar to this is acceptable. 
(b)  If  you  anneal  the  alloy  at  400  ◦C,  schematically  show  a  plot  of  temperature  vs.  time, 
particle size r vs.  time, particle spacing L vs.  time, and yield strength vs.  particle size. 
(Treat any additional equilibrium phases in a continuum manner ignoring interfaces and 
atomic structure.)  In the last plot, describe the different strengthening mechanisms,  in­
cluding relative magnitudes, the would be the effective mechanisms at different times. 

Solution:  The  ﬁrst  thing  we  have  to  realize  is  that  the  Al-Cu  phase  diagram  tells  us 
that  at  2  at.%  Cu  and  400  ◦C,  the  equilibrium  phases  are  Al  and  Al2Cu.  Therefore, 

3.22 Mechanical Behavior of Materials 

8 

Prof. K.J. Van Vliet 

(e)(S)(S)(e)ssssbebS,sSse|be||bS|bebSwhen we heat the sample to 400 ◦C, the Cu will precipitate out of solution to form Al2Cu. 

The  ﬁgure  below  are  the  four  plots  (schematically)  requested  for  this  problem.  The 
particle  size  r-time  t  plot  assumes  diffusion  limit  growth,  therefore  I  assumed  that  r 
goes as  t1/2 .  Because  the  volume  fraction of Cu  is  constant,  as  the particles grow  (by 
coalescence) the spacing between the particles L must also increase with time; and will 
do so at a rate similar to the change of r with t. 

The  yield  strength  resulting  from  this  precipitation  is  shown  schematically  in  the  last 
plot.  Because Cu is a substitutional solute in Al, the yield strength of the solid solution 
Al-Cu  will  only  be  slightly  higher  than  the  yield  strength  of  pure  Al.  As  precipitation 
begins and r  increases,  the dislocations will have  to either cut  through or bow around 
the precipitates. We noted in class and recitation that in the case of cutting, the strength 
of  the  material  goes  as  r1/2 ,  and  that  for  bowing  it  goes  as  L−1 ,  which  is  related  to 
r−1  as  noted  above.  Plotting  these  two  curves  schematically  we  note  that  they  cross 
at  a  critical  precipitate  size  r  .  At  this  point  is  where  the  maximum  yield  strength  is 
◦
observed. At r < r  , it will be easier for dislocations to cut through the precipitates. At 
◦
r > r  however, bowing is preferred. 
◦ 

(c)  Suppose  instead  of  an  alloy,  you  started  with  a  composite  of  Al  with  Al2O3  particles 
dispersed  in  it.  (Assume  the  volume  fraction  of  the  particles  is  the  same  as  the  parti­
cles in part (b).)  How would you expect the maximum yield strength to change and the 
particle size r at which this maximum occurs to change relative to the metal alloy case? 
Show this on a yield strength vs.  particle size graph for both materials. 

Solution:  The  Al2O3  particles  are  stiffer  (have  a  larger  shear  modulus  G)  than  the 

3.22 Mechanical Behavior of Materials 

9 

Prof. K.J. Van Vliet 

cuttingbowingrσyσsσmaxrorttTto400 oCLtAl2Cu  precipitates.  Thus  for  the  same  particle  size,  the  line  tension  (=  Gb2/2)  of  a 
dislocation  in an Al2O3  particle will be  larger  than  that  in an Al2Cu precipitate.  This 
implies a  shift upwards of  the  cutting  curve  (see ﬁgure below).  Therefore using Al2O3 
particles  instead  of  precipitation  hardening,  we  can  achieve  a  higher  maximum  yield 
strength (τ �
�◦ 
), but we must note that it occurs at a smaller radius (r
).

team will present a 15 minute discussion of the special topic during  lecture at  the end of the 
term, summarizing key mechanical behavior topics covered in the wiki over the term.  Three 
of  these  topics  will  be  chosen  at  random  to  be  included  on  Quiz  3,  and  you’ll  answer  2  of 
them (one cannot be from your own team). You may want to start discussing how you’ll plan 
to do this short presentation.
