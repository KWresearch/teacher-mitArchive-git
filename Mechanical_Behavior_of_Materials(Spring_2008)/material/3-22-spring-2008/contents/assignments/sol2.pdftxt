Problem Set #2 
Due: Tuesday, March 4 by 5:00 PM 

1.  You did such an outstanding job in the engineering department at Unique Unicycles that they 
gave you a promotion to the R&D department.  Your ﬁrst assignment there is to study a new 
material  developed  by  your  competitors  Un-Unique  Unicycles.  The  material  is  a  compos­
ite  composed  of  unidirectional  ﬁbers  in  a  polymer  matrix  (Fig.  1).  While  another  research 
scientists  determines  what  the  ﬁbers  and  matrix  are,  your  boss  Dr.  Van  Vliet  asks  you  to 
determine  the stiffness  tensor components  for such a structure  in  terms of Young’s Modulus 
and Poisson’s ratio. 

Figure 1: A composite material comprised of unidirectional ﬁbers in a matrix. 

Solution:  From Fig.  1 we  see  that  there  is  some  symmetry  to  this  structure.  In particular,  it 
is composed of three orthogonal axes with four-fold rotational symmetry along the x axis and 
two-fold  rotational  symmetry  along  the  y  and  z  axes.  Therefore  this  structure  is  tetragonal 
and has six independent elastic constants. 

Consider  the  strain  if  the  composite  is  loaded  by  a  force  F  along  the  x  axis  (which  I  will 
refer  to  as  the  1-direction).  If  the  ﬁber  and  the matrix  are well  bonded,  they  experience  the 
same strain such that 

�11  = �M11  = �F11 
where �11 , �M11 ,  and �F11  is the strain in the composite, matrix and ﬁber, respectively. 

However, the resulting stress in the ﬁbers is different because of the different Young’s moduli 
in  the  ﬁbers  and  matrix.  (Note  that  because  we  know  nothing  of  the  ﬁber  or  matrix  mi­
crostructures we are treating them as isotropic.)  The stress in the ﬁber σF11  and matrix σM11 
are therefore 

σF11  = EF �11  and σM11EM �11 
where EM  and EF  are the Young’s moduli of the matrix and ﬁber, respectively. 

The  total  applied  force must  be  in  equilibrium with  the  total  force  due  to  the  stresses  in  the 
ﬁber and matrix.  The internal force is given by multiplying the stress by the area of the ﬁber 
or matrix  it  acts  on.  If  the  total  cross-sectional  area  of  the  composite  is A,  then  the  cross-
sectional  area  of  the  ﬁbers  and matrix  are  given  by  the  total  area multiplied  by  the  volume 
fraction of ﬁber or matrix.  Thus the force acting on the ﬁbers and matrix is given by 
F11  = VFAσF  + VMAσM

yxzSubstituting our deﬁnitions of strain and dividing by A gives 

σ11  = (VFEF  + VMEM )�11 

From this equation, we can see that the modulus of the composite along the x axis E1  is 

E11  = VFEF  + VMEM 

Now  consider  if  the  composite  is  loaded  along  the  y  axis  (which  I  will  refer  to  as  the  2­
direction).  The ﬁbers and matrix will experience different strains.  The total strain �2  will be 
the sum of the strain in each component (multiplied by the volume fraction) such that 

�22  = VF �22F  + VM �22M 

The stress applied σ will be distributed equally over both the ﬁbers and matrix and therefore 
we can write 

�22  =

σVF 
EF 

+ 

σVM
EM 

From this equation, we see that the modulus along the y axis E2  is 

EFEM
VMEF  + VFEM 
Futhermore, because the “unit cell” of the composite is the same along the y and z direction 
(e.g.  the composite has a tetragonal structure), E22  = E33 . 

E22  = 

We can also do a similar analysis to determine the shear moduli G12  and ﬁnd 

GFGM
VMGF  + VFGM 
where GM  and GF  are the shear moduli of the matrix and ﬁbers, respectively. Again because 
of symmetry, we know that G12  = G13 . 

G12  = 

For  the  shear  modulus G23 ,  we  know  that  the  yz  plane  (or  23  plane)  is  an  isotropic  plane. 
Therefore 

E22
2(1 + ν23 )

where ν23  is Poisson’s ratio that relates the strain in the 2 and 3 direction.


G23  = 

There will also be other Poisson effects in the composite. For example, the �22  and �33  will be 
equal to −ν12 �11  for an applied strain �11  =  σ11  .  (Note that because of symmetry ν12  = ν13 .)

Note  the  factors  of  two  in  S44 , S55  and  S66 .  These  are  a  consequence  of  converting  from 
mathematical strain to engineering strain. 
With  the  exception  of  our  Poisson  ratios,  the  other  terms  in  this  tensor  are  in  terms  of  the 
component properties and volumes.  Let us now do this for the Poisson ratios.

Consider  a  sample  section  of  the  composite  (Fig.  2)  with  a  stress  applied  along  the  x  axis. 
The sum of the change in length of the ﬁbers (δF ) and matrix (δM ) in the y direction will equal 
the change  in  length of  the composite  (δC ) along  this direction.  We can write  these changes 
as 

δF  =  tF �22F  = −tFνF �11F 
δM  =  tM �22M  = −tMνM �11M 
δC  =  tC �22  = −tCν12 �11 

We know that along the x axis, �11F  = �11M  = �11  and therefore

Once again, because of symmetry ν12  =  ν13  as we have implied already in writing the com­
pliance tensor as we did. 

The Poisson ratio for the isotropic plane ν23  is a little more complicated but if similar princi­
ples are used, we ﬁnd 

ν23  =

With all the composites elastic constants now deﬁned in terms of the volume fraction, Young’s 
moduli, shear moduli, and Poisson’s ratios of the matrix and ﬁber, we can compute the stiff­
ness  tensor  Cij  by  taking  the  inversion  of  the  compliance  tensor  Sij .  This  can  be  done  by 
hand, but would be more easily done using some mathematical software such as Mathematica 
or Maple. As you have found, the inversion is a large messy matrix which I will not present.

2.  Two  isotropic  materials  (A  &  B)  are  being  considered  for  use  in  shoe  insoles.  When  used 
as insoles the average strain with respect to time �(t) of the materials is that presented in the 
spreadsheet posted on the MIT Server ( 2-2.xls).

plied stress. 

Solution:  Material  A  has  an  immediate  response  to  the  stress  and  strain  is  constant 
with  time.  We  recognize  this  behavior  as  characteristic  of  a  linear  elastic  solid.  An 
appropriate model for its stress/strain behavior is therefore Hooke’s Law (� = σ/E ). 

For Material B, we  see  that  there  is  an  instantaneous  response with  the  applied  stress 
followed  by  a  strain  that  is  dependent  on  time.  This  appears  to  be  a  linear  viscoelas­
tic material.  The  constitutive models we have  for  these materials  include  the Maxwell 
Solid,  Kelvin/Voight  Solid,  and  Standard  Linear  Solid.  We  can  eliminate  the Maxwell 
Solid because it cannot very accurately predict this type of strain response with time, as 
discussed in lecture.

where  σ  is  the  initial  stress,  E  is  the  Young’s modulus,  t  is  the  time,  and  τ  is  the  re­

laxation  time.  If we plot  this with our data  for Material B  (Fig. 3), we see  that we can 
accurately predict the strain at later times, but not at earlier times especially the instan­
taneous strain we observe at t = 0 s. We therefore must consider another model. 

Because  the  Maxwell  Solid  can  accurately  model  instantaneous  strains,  how  about  a

where τ�  and τσ  are the relaxation times for ﬁxed strain and stress, respectively, and ER

◦
(b)  Characterize  these materials,  focusing  on  their  elastic moduli  and  the  relaxation  time. 
Without having handled the materials, what class would each fall into? 

� = 

Solution:  Using  our  models,  we  know  we  can  calculate  the  moduli  of  the  two  mate­
rials as  long as we know  the strain and stress.  The strain  is given  to us  from our data. 
The  stress we will  estimate based on  the weight of a person and  the “cross-sectional” 
area of a  foot.  For my estimations,  I assumed a 170  lb.  (∼700 N) person and  for sim­
plicity treated a leg as a rod with a three inch diameter. 

Because  Material  A  is  a  linear  elastic  solid,  its  Young’s  modulus  can  be  calculated 
from Hooke’s Law. Doing so, we ﬁne EA  = 40 GPa. The Young’s Modulus for Material

B  is  obtained  from  our  model.  At  t  = 0  s,  the  strain  �  is  equal  to  the  instantaneous 
strain �  . Using the values we are given, we can solve for E  in the same way we did for 
◦
Material A  to ﬁnd EB=4 GPa.  (Note  that depending how  you deﬁned  your  stress,  you 
may get very different answers.) 

The relaxtion time τ  for Material A is zero because it is a linear elastic solid and reach 
maximum strain instantaneously.  The relaxation time for Material B was determined to 
be τ  = 2 s when we ﬁtted the data. 

Based  on  the  moduli  and  strain  behavior  of  these  materials,  we  can  categorize  Ma­
terial A  as  a  linear  elastic  solid  that  is most  likely a metal  and Material B as  a  linear 
viscoelastic solid such as a polymer. 

(c)  Which material is better suited for the job? Explain by showing the σ (t) (given that you 
take a step every second) and the resulting strain for each material. Deﬁne a quantity for 
judging the effectiveness of each material in this application.  What would this quantity

Solution:  We  can model  the  stress  applied  in  one  foot while we  are walking  as  a  sine 
wave such that 

σ = σ  sin ω t 
◦ 

where  ω  is  the  angular  frequency.  In  a  linear  elastic  solid,  such  as  Material  A,  the 
strain would mirror the strain (with a reduced magnitude equal to the stress divided by 
the modulus) because the response is instantaneous.  It can therefore be written as 

� = �  sin ω t. 
◦ 

What  about  the  strain  in  Material  B?  Using  a  sine  wave  complicates  the  problem  in 
this  situation,  so  let’s model  our  steps  as  a  block  wave.  This means  that  the material 
is  loaded  at  a  constant  stress  σ  for  a  time  t  = 1  s.  If  we  look  at  our  strain  data  for 
◦
Material B from t = 0 to 1 s (you should plot it in smaller time steps than 0.5 s to better 
resolve  this),  we  see  that  the  strain  instantaneously  increases  to  �  before  increasing 
◦
nearly linearly with time. 

When  the  stress  is  removed  (e.g.  you  step  with  the  other  foot),  the  material  will  in­
stantly  recover  �  and  then  recover  all  the  remaining  strain  over  the  next  second  (the 
◦
time to take the other step). 
So what metric can we use in determining each material’s utility in shoe insoles?  Con­
tinuing  with  our  block  wave  approximation,  let’s  plot  the  stress  versus  strain  in  each 
material  for  one  step  (Fig.  5).  Material A  reversibly  follows  a  line  between  the  origin 
and  (σ  ,  �  ) while Material B  follows a circuit.  The energy dissipated  in  this circuit  is 
◦
◦
just the area inside the circuit. For Material A, this energy is zero, so clearly Material B 
is better suited for use in shoe insoles because it can dissipate some of the energy from 
walking. 

Ideally  the  perfect material  for  an  insole would  dissipate  as much  energy  as  possible. 
Since σ  is set within the range of a human’s weight, to do this we would want the mate­
◦
rial to reach maximum strain �
in the time it takes to take one step.  The material must 
∞
also be able to fully recover the strain in the same amount of time. 
(d)  A  similar  concept  can  be  applied  to measure  the  natural  frequency  of molecular  chain 
rotation  at  the  glass  transition  temperature  of  a  polymer.  Explain  how  you  do  this  ex­
perimentally and the results you would expect. 

Solution:  At  the  glass  transition  temperature  in  polymer  there  is  a  large  increase  in 
the free volume, allowing for molecular motion to occur more easily. When a frequency 
similar  to  the  natural  frequency  of  the  molecular  chain  rotation  is  applied,  (nearly) 
complete damping will occur.  If the applied frequency is too high,  the chains will have 
insufﬁcient time to move and the polymer will seem stiff.  If the applied frequency is too 
low, the chains will have more time to move and the polymer will seem soft.

3.  You  are  responsible  for  performing  uniaxial  tensile  tests  on  three  very  different  materials: 
a  316  stainless  steel  alloy,  alumina  (Al2O3 ),  and  high  density  polyethylene  (HDPE).  How­
ever,  before performing  the  actual  tests,  you  are  asked  to predict  the  elastic  stress vs.  strain 
responses of each of the materials based on the mechanical properties of these materials doc­
umented  in  the  literature  (e.g.,  material  property  databases  such  as  matweb.com,  linked  on 
the MIT Server.)

(a)  Graph  the  engineering  and  true  stress  (MPa)  versus  engineering  and  true  strain  (%) 
response  for  all  three materials  on  a  single  graph,  up  to  an  applied  engineering  strain 
value of .01 (or 1%) in strain increments of 0.0005. 
Solution:  The  Young’s  elastic  moduli  for  these  materials  are  approximately  210  GPa 
(steel); 370 GPa (alumina); and 1 GPa (HDPE); data source = matweb.com.Graphically, 
we need only plot the stress-strain response with these values as the slope.  There is no 
measureable difference between the true and engineering stress and strain during purely 
elastic  deformation,  though  technically  the  Poisson’s  effect  does  slightly  decrease  the 
cross-sectional area from which the true stress is calculated. 

(b)  Remark on the differences in behaviors seen for each of the three materials as related to 
their  relevant mechanical  properties.  Also,  looking  at  the magnitude  of  the  stresses  at 
the maximum applied  strain,  do you expect  all of  these materials  to deform elastically 
up  to  these  strains?  If not, what was  the  fallacy  in  solely using Hooke’s  law  to predict 
the stress-strain behaviors for each of the materials? 
Solution: The requested maximum strain of 0.01 would induce the following stress mag­
nitudes: 2.1 GPa (stainless steel); 3.7 GPa (alumina); 10 MPa (HDPE). The reasons for 
the  differences  among  the  values  of E  and  the  corresponding  stress  generated  are  at­
tributable to the resistance to bond stretching in metal alloys (nondirectional) vs. oxides 
(ionic/covalent) and to organic polymer chain displacement (HDPE). At these levels of 
stress, the stainless steel would no longer behave elastically (yield stress at which plas­
ticity commences is approximately 1 GPa); the alumina would fracture (tensile fracture 
stress  is  0.3  GPa,  and  compressive  fracture  stress  is  3  GPa);  and  the  HDPE  would 
likely plastically deform (tensile yield stress is on order of 10 MPa).  The fallacy is that 
Hooke’s Law cannot be assumed for any arbitrary strain level; it applied only in a stress 
state that corresponds to a state of elastic (reversible) deformation.

cm  length  and  2  cm  diameter.  Show whether  a  uniaxial  load  frame  of maximum  load 
capability =  100  kN  (standard  capabilities  of  load  frames  such  as  Instrons  available  at 
MIT) will be sufﬁcient to deform all three materials to the requested engineering normal 
strain of 1%. Here, neglect the possibility that the materials might not remain intact (all 
in one piece) to that applied strain. 
Solution:  The initial cross-sectional area of the cylinder is 
Ao  = πr2  = 3.14x10−4 m 2 
If we neglect the above consideration that the material may yield or fracture at a strain 
of 0.01, we can compute the required force as F  =  σxAo .  This would correspond to a 
required  force of 6.6 x 105  N (stainless steel); 1.2 x 105  N (alumina); and 3.1 x 103  N. 
As 100 kN = 1 x 105  N, it is clear that such a load cell could only deform the HDPE, but 
not  the  SS  or  alumina.  Luckily  for  us,  none  of  these materials  behave  linearly  elastic 
manner up to these strains.

4.  Atomic interactions can be modeled using a variety of potential energy approximations.  One 
very common potential form is the Lennard-Jones 6:12 potential: 
U (r) = 4�[(σ/r)12  − (σ/r)6 ] 

where � and σ are constants speciﬁc to a given material (note:  these terms are NOT equivalent 
to  stress  and  strain,  but  this  is  the  standard  notation  for  the  L-J  parameters).  Here,  r  is  the 
interatomic  spacing  given  in  units  of Angstroms,  and U (r)  is  given  in  units  of  eV  atom−1 . 
A molecular  dynamics  simulation was  performed  by  Zhang  and  coworkers  [1]  to  study  the 
properties  of  Al  thin  ﬁlms  in  which  the  authors  proposed  a  Lennard-Jones  potential  of  the 
form  above  to model Al-Al  interactions.  The  values  used  for  the material  parameters were: 
� = 0.368 and σ = 2.548 (we’ve rounded off the values in the paper for your problem set). 

(a)  What are the assumed units of � and σ in Zhang and coworkers’ potential for aluminum? 
Solution:  As discussed  in class,  � must have units of energy  in  [kJ/mol] or  [eV/atom]; 
and σ must have units of [m]. 
(b)  Using  the  given  material  parameters  and  the  form  of  the  interatomic  potential  energy 
curve,  plot  U (r)  for  aluminum  from  r  = 0  to  3.5  Angstroms  in  increments  of  < 
0.25 Angstroms. 
Solution: Using Excel, the following plot of U(r) was generated.  The scale of the x-axis 
was set so that it ranged from 2.25 to 4 angstroms, while the scale of the y-axis was set 
so  that  it ranged  from  -0.4  to 1eV  in  increments of 0.2 eV. This  is much  less preferable 
to graphing in Mathematica, MATLAB, or Maple! 
(c)  Determine  the  equation  for  and  graph  the  interatomic  forces  F  as  a  function  of  inter­
atomic separation r  for Al over the same range of r used in part (a), indicating units of 
F (r). Also, analytically and graphically determine the equilibrium interatomic spacing, 
ro . Mark this point on both the graphs produced in parts (a) and (b). 
Solution: The interatomic forces between atoms can be determined from the interatomic 
potential energy function given the relationship: F = dU/dr. Taking the derivative of the 

3.22 Mechanical Behavior of Materials

Lennard-Jones 6:12 form of U(r) with respect to r gives the following relationship: 
F  = −24�{2(σ12/r13  − σ6/r7 

(2) 

This  function  is  then  plotted  for  the  same  range  of  r  values  used  in  part  (a)  to  obtain 
The  equilibrium  interatomic  spacing  can  be  determined  by  setting  F(r)  equal  to  zero 

and  solving  for  r  (this  can  be  easily  done  using  a  computer  program  or  a  graphing 
calculator).  Doing  this,  one  obtains  an  equilibrium  interatomic  spacing  of  ro=2.86 
Angstroms  (0.286 nm).  This point  is marked as a  red dot on both  the graphs  for parts 
(a) and (b). Notice that the equilibrium interatomic spacing corresponds to the minimum

the interatomic force curve F(r). 
(d)  Compare  this  equilibrium  interatomic  spacing  to  the  literature  value  of  atomic  radius 
for aluminum, and from that comparison explain what you think Zhang and coworkers 
assumed in choosing the constants � and σ  that made ro  come out this way. 
Solution:  This is exactly twice the atomic radius of Al (0.143 nm).  Zhang et al.  actually 
chose  the  LJ  constants  so  that  this  equilibrium  interatomic  spacing  would  reﬂect  the 
interatomic distances in the close-packed or ¡110¿ direction of this fcc metal. 
(e)  Figure 6 shows interatomic energy curves [V (r) is equivalent to our U (r)] for Mg that 
were  calculated  by  Chavarria  [2]  (squares)  and  McMahan  and  coworkers  [3]  (dotted 
and  solid  curve).  These  data  are  shown  in  arbitrary  units  (a.u.)  which  is  typical  of 
computational/experimental results  that have funny units peculiar  to  the computational 
programming units, but r  turns out  to be expressed  in ∼  2 × Angstroms  (i.e., 9 a.u.  = 
4.5 Angstroms).  Comparing these curves with that calculated in part (a) for Al, explain 
whether  you would  expect magnesium  to  have  a  lower  or  higher  elastic modulus  than 
aluminum?  Is  this conﬁrmed by  the  literature values of elastic properties and physical 
properties of Al and Mg? 
Solution:  From  consideration  of  the  atomistic  basis  for  linear  (small  strain)  elasticity 
we derived  the  following  relationship  in class, E  =  dU /dr2/ro , where  the  term  in  the 
numerator  represents  the  curvature  of  the  interatomic  potential  energy  curve  at  r  = 
ro ,  and  the  term  in  the  denominator  represents  the  interatomic  equilibrium  spacing. 
Thus,  if  and  only  if  we  assume  the  U(r)  of  two  materials  had  the  same  curvature  at 
the  energy  minimum,  we  see  that  a  larger  equilibrium  interatomic  spacing  leads  to  a 
smaller  elastic  (or Youngs) modulus.  Since magnesium  is  seen  to have an  equilibrium 
interatomic  spacing  of  about  3  Angstroms  (0.32  nm)  which  is  larger  that  calculated 
for aluminum  (  ro  =2.8 A or 0.28 nm), we would  expect magnesium  to have a  smaller 
elastic  modulus  (i.e.,  magnesium  is  more  compliant  than  aluminum).  The  increase  in 
equilibrium interatomic spacing can be attributed to the fact that Mg has a much lower 
density  compared  to  Al,  which  in  turn  means  larger  interatomic  separations  between 
atoms.  In  fact,  if  we  look  up  the  actual  values  for  Youngs modulus  using MatWeb  we 
ﬁnd  the  moduli  of  aluminum  and  magnesium  to  be  68  GPa  and  44  GPa,  respectively. 
This is a pretty signiﬁcant difference for two elements which lie right next to each other 
on the periodic table and have essentially the same melting temperatures!!! 
(f)  Again,  considering  the  relationship  between  the Young’s modulus,  the  equilibrium  in­
teratomic spacing, and U (r) curvature, what effect do you think temperature has on the 
measured Young’s modulus?  Provide  a  conceptual  explanation of your  answer.  (Hint: 
Think about what happens to atoms inside of a material as you heat it up.) 
Solution: As temperature increases, atomic vibrations are caused which cause the equi­
librium  spacing  between  atoms  to  increase.  Since  the  Youngs modulus  decreases with 
increasing equilibrium spacing, an  increase  in  temperature causes  the elastic modulus 
to decrease.  To see this another way, we can also note that the modulus is proportional 
to  the slope of  the  interatomic  force, F(r), curve.  Taking our calculated F(r) graph  for 
aluminum, we see that if we move our original equilibrium spacing from ro=2.86 A to a 
higher value (lets say ro ’= 3.1 A), the slope of the curve greatly decreases which repre­

sents a decrease in the elastic modulus. Additionally, the atoms will vibrate more about 
this ro , which means that the curvature at the bottom of the U(r) well will be decreased 
(the  well  gets  wider),  so  the  2nd  derivative  of  U(r),  which  is  directly  proportional  to 
E,  will  decrease.  Physically,  the  resistance  to  bond  stretching  decreases  as  the  well 
curvature decreases.

5.  The Worm  Like  Chain  (WLC)  model  of  rubber  elasticity  has  been  used  to  analyze  the  de­
formation of DNA under uniaxial  loading.  Bouchiat and coworkers used magnetic  tweezers 
to  extend  lambda-DNA  (λ-DNA)  and  applied  the WLC model  to  infer  its  structure  and  re­
sistance  to  bending.  Table  1  is  a  subset  of  the  experimental  data  Bouchiat  and  coworkers 
reported, with additional points  (Bouchiat et al.,Biophys  J.  (1999) Fig.  2).  Apply  the WLC 
model to determine the following: 

(a)  Graph these experimentally measured data as force on the chain vs.  stretch of the chain, 
Fc  vs.  λc  =  r/r where r  is  the distance between chain ends before  force  is applied, 
◦
◦
and  indicate  the  region  over which  the  experimentally measured  data  is  ﬁt  reasonably 
well by the WLC model. 

Solution:  One  could  note  the  values  of  Lp  and  Lc  from  the  authors’  ﬁt  to  these  data, 
and/or obtained your own ﬁt to these data by executing a ﬁt with these values as initial 
guesses of Lp  and Lc . The better your “starting guess” for these values, the closer your

ﬁt will approximate the authors’.  The solution below assumes ignorance of Lc  and Lp , 
and  compares  the  values  obtained with  that  of  the  authors.  Note  that,  in  practice,  Lc 
can actually be calculated from knowledge of the structure of a polymer chain; Lp  can 
only be  estimated  from  experiments  like  this one,  or  from measurements of  the  lengths 
over  which  thermal  ﬂuctuations  of  the  chain  are  uncorrelated  in  space  and  time.  (We 
did  not  cover  the  latter  approach  in  class,  but  it  is  consistent with  the  deﬁnition  of Lp 
that we discussed in class.) 

The  WLC  model  covered  in  class  assumes  a  Gaussian  distribution  of  chain  end-end 
distances  r, and  thus predicts a  fairly  linear  relationship between F and  r.  This  linear 
relationship is observed only true for the low extension region and the high extension re­
gion, as the experimental data is highly nonlinear in between. The Gaussian assumption 
holds best in the low-extension region, however, because it is in this region that there is a 
”normal” distribution of chain end-end distances, unbiased by the application of force 
to  these chains.  For  these data,  the  limit of a reasonable  linear ﬁt  to  the  low extension 
data is at about the third data point, or F = 0.18 pN and r= 10 µm. 

Note that this ﬁt was achieved by identifying the values of Lc  and Lp  that minimized the 
error between  the WLC-predicted  force and  the experimental value of  force over  these 
three points (Lc  = 8.6 µm; Lp  =  25.6 nm) for kB  = 1.38x10−23  J/K and T  =  298 K 
(room  temp).  As  this was  linear,  the  value  of  r  was  then  identiﬁed  via  linear  extrap­
◦
olation  (r  = 1.95  µm).  This  is  an  interesting  deviation  from  our  prediction  that  the 
◦
force = 0 when r = 0, because although the time-space average value of r = 0 (if there 
is a  statistical distribution of  r),  r was not  equal  to  zero at  the  instant  sampled by  this 
experiment;  the DNA  chain  ends  were  about  1 micron  apart.  Strictly  speaking,  r  = 0 
should be deﬁned to either mean < r >= 0, the time-averaged, Gaussian value of most 
likely chain end-end distance in the absence of applied force; or as dr = 0, where dr is 
the change in chain end-end distance. 
(b)  The number of nucleotides in this λ-DNA. 

Solution:  The  number  of  nucleotides  that  comprise  this  DNA  is  governed  by  the  con­

tour  length or  fully extended  length of  this DNA  sample.  According  to  the above WLC 
ﬁt to the low- extension region of the F-r response, Lc  = 8.6 µm.  We know right away 
that this is a poor estimate of Lc  due to the Gaussian distribution P(r, n)dr, because the 
WLC  force should  tend  toward  inﬁnity as r  =  Lc , and  the experimental data  indicates 
that this occurs at about 15 µm. Visually, the data indicate that Lc  ∼ 15 m. 

The number of nucleotides in this polynucleotide is then equal to the number that can ﬁt 
in this length; if we assume this is single stranded DNA, we divide Lc by the size of one 
nucleotide, and if we assume this is double stranded DNA, wed multiply that answer by 
two  (2 nucleotides  in one basepair).  Youd need  to check out  the paper  to be  sure  (as  I 
didnt give you that information in the problem). 

The  length  of  a  single  nucleotide  (and,  for  that  matter,  a  single  basepair)  is  0.33  nm 
[Mandelkern M, Elias J, Eden D, Crothers D (1981).  ”The dimensions of DNA in solu­
tion”.  J Mol Biol 152 (1):  15361.] 

Thus,  the  number  of  nucleotides  in  ssDNA  would  be  8600 nm/0.33 nm = 26,060  nu­
cleotides; the number in dsDNA would be 52,121 nucleotides or 26,060 basepairs (bp). 

Note  that  this  is  in  contrast  to  the  estimates  from  the  authors  of  the  paper,  as  they  as­
sumed the nonlinear form of the WLC model and found from their ﬁt that Lc  = 15.6 µm 
(which gives 47,272 nucleotides (for ssDNA); or 94,545 nucleotides or 47,272 basepairs 
(for dsDNA). 

(c)  The  number  of  nucleotides  that  comprise  a  segment  of  the  DNA  that  is  signiﬁcantly 
resistant to bending. 

Solution: This length is equivalent to the persistence length Lp , which my ﬁt in (a) deter­
mined to be 25.6 nm. The number of nucleotides in ssDNA would be 25.6 nm/0.33 nm = 77 nucleotides 
(rounding down to integer values), and would be 155 nucleotides in a dsDNA segment.

Contrast this with the authors estimate: Lp  = 51 nm 154 nucleotides for ssDNA; again, 
we underestimate by a factor of two by ﬁtting to only the Gaussian/low extension region. 
(d)  The effective entropic spring constant of λ-DNA, ks .  Note  that  this  is often deﬁned as 
the  resistance  to  extension  at  large  forces  –  why  is  this?  Compare  your  value  to  that 
stated by  the Bouchiat and coworkers, and explain why  they expressed  this stiffness  in 
units of [N] instead of [N m−1 ]. 

Solution: Although we could deﬁne the spring constant as the slope of the linear region 
in the low-extension region, the forces are so low in this region that they are essentially 
at  the  limit  of measurable  forces  with  existing  instrumentation.  As  a  result,  there  is  a 
tendency to use more reliable data at higher forces/extensions. The entropic spring con­
stant or slope to my ﬁt shown in (a) is 2 × 10−8  N/m. 

At  low  forces/extensions,  the  linear  term  r/Lc  dominates;  at  high  forces/extensions, 
though, note that the quadratic term in our WLC equation dominates, or F  ∼ kT /Lp [4(1r/Lc )]−
2, which can be rewritten as [F /(kT /Lp )] − 1/2  =  4(1r/Lc ), where you can see  that 
the  LHS  of  the  equality  is  unitless  [N  *  m  /  N-m/K  *  K]  and  the  units  on  the  RHS  of 
the  equality  are  also  unitless  [m/m].  Thus,  one  can  obtain  Lp  and  Lc  via  a  linear  ﬁt 
to  these data  so plotted.  Smith/Bustamante did  this  to demonstrate  the  linearity of  the 
relationship at high force, and as a check on their ﬁt.  If one plots force [N] vs.  extension 
ratio r/ro or as r/Lc  [m/m], the slope to the linear portion of this response, k, is in units 
of only [N], not [N/m].  This is often presented as such to compare the effective stiffness 
of chains of different contour length Lc . 

To compare with Bouchiat  et al.s estimate of k  (1.3 pN, stated on  the graph), we could 
multiply  our  k  by  our  Lc ,  so  k  =  2E(-8)  N/m*8.6E(-6)  m  =1.72E(-13)  N  =  0.172  pN. 
Our ﬁt to the low-extension region underestimates their k by an order of magnitude, but 
of course wed expect that because we can visually see in (a) that the rate of change of F 
vs.  r is much greater at large forces/extensions (and, also, our Lc  is  2x too small  like 
the Grinchs heart). 

(e)  The minimal  force required  to break  the phosphate ester bonds  that  join nucleotides  in 
DNA? 

Solution:  Here, we know that the force applied up to the contour length Lc  only serves 
to  uncoil  the  coiled  DNA,  and  no  force  is  transferred  to  the  primary  bonds  like  the 
phosphate  ester  bonds.  The  force  required  to  load  and  break  these  primary  bonds 
must  be  greater  than  the  force  required  to  achieve  the  fully  extended  polynucleotide, 
so Fmin  = F (r = Lc ) or  10 pN. 
(f)  The  stretch  λc  =  r/r at which  the WLC  prediction  diverges  from  that  of  the  Freely 
◦
Jointed Chain (FJC) model, by graphing the FJC prediction on the graph in (a), and the 
reasons for this divergence. 

Solution:  Here,  both  WLC  and  FJC  predict  a  linear  relation  between  F  and  r,  so

both  only  ﬁt  reasonably  well  to  the  ﬁrst  few  points  given  in  the  experimental  data  ta­
ble.  Below,  the best ﬁt of  the FJC equation  to  these 3 points  is given  in orange  (where 
Lc  =  10 µm and b = 92 nm).  The WLC and FJC diverge  from each other  for  increas­
ing  extension,  r.  Mathematically,  this  is  because  the  quadratic  r/Lc  term  in  the WLC 
equation dominates.  Physically, this is because the WLC incorporates the resistance to 
segment  BENDING  and  ROTATION  that  the  FJC model  disallows  (all  segments  rigid 
and straight over length b, between frictionless joints).
