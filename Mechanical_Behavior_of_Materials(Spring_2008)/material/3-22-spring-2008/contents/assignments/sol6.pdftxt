Problem Set #6 
Due:  Friday, May 9 by 5:00 PM 
1.  Describe  thoroughly  yet  concisely  three  (general)  toughening mechanisms  in materials.  Be 
sure to include an example of each, and not to confuse (yield) strengthening with toughening. 
For one mechanism, show a fractograph and brieﬂy note features  in  the fracture surface  that 
illustrate how the mechanism works. 

Solution:  The  theme  of  toughening mechanisms  is  energy  dissipation.  The more  energy  the 
material  can  dissipate  through  other means  besides  crack  growth,  the  tougher  the material 
can be.  Examples of  this  include phase  transformations, crack deﬂection, and second phase 
pull-out. 
•	 Phase transformations – The energy put into the material by an applied stress/strain is 
dissipated when the material at the crack tip (where the stress concentration is highest) 
undergoes a phase transformation. 
•	 Crack  deﬂection  –  If  the  crack  is  deﬂected  around  tougher  precipitates/particles  (in 
small  volume  fraction)  or  along  grain  boundaries  (intergranular  cracking  as  opposed 
to transgranular cracking), the crack must travel a longer distance, which requires more 
energy. 
•	 Fiber pullout – This toughening mechanism operates in composite materials where the 
reinforcement  phase  is  in  ﬁber  form  and  the  ﬁbers  are  tougher  than  the  ﬁber/matrix 
interface.  In this scenario, a propagating crack will be arrested at the ﬁber.  Eventually 
enough energy will be applied such that the ﬁber will be pulled out of the matrix.

nisms named slightly differently  in  the context of bone  fracture and  fatigue  failure discussed 
in Lecture 20. 

2.  Lowhaphandu and Lewandowski [Scripta Mater.  38, 1811(1998)] studied the effect of crack 
tip  radius  on  the  stress  intensity  factor  at  failure  for  a  speciﬁc  material,  as  summarized  in 
the graph below.  (Note that they call crack tip radius “notch root radius” and stress intensity 
factor at failure “fracture toughness”.) 

(a)  Using Inglis’s analysis of stress at the tip of an elliptical hole, calculate the stress at the 
crack  tip  (as  a  function  of  applied  stress)  for  the  largest  and  smallest  crack  tip  radius 
considered.  (This is an single edge-crack with initial crack length a of 25 mm.)

Solution:  Inglis’s  analysis  for  the  stress  σ  at  the  tip  of  a  crack  with  length  a  and  ra­
dius of curvature R is 
a 
1 + 2 
R 
where σ    is the applied (global or far-ﬁeld) stress. Using this relation with a = 25 mm,
◦
we ﬁnd  that σ  =  21σ  	 for R  =  250 µm and σ  =  20001σ  for R  =  2.5 A. ˚
(Note  that

I assumed an “atomically sharp” crack tip radius for the second example, even though 
it is known that the crack is NOT atomistically sharp.  Anything ≤  1 µm is acceptable, 
however.)

(b)  Are your  results  from part  (a)  consistent with  the  results  in  the graph below  (i.e.,  con­
sistent with the fact that at the largest crack tip radius we measure has the largest stress 
intensity factor)? Explain why they are or are not consistent. 

Solution:  Yes  these  results  are  consistent.  These  results  suggest  that  a  sharper  crack 
tip acts as a stronger stress concentrator than a more blunt crack tip. Therefore it would 
will take less stress to reach the “critical stress intensity” needed to fracture the mate­
rial. 

You should also consider whether this answer will be dinfferent when you treat the stress 
concentration as the prefactor magnifying the applied stress in the Inglis solution.  This 
prefactor can be called the stress concentration or stress intensity factor, but mean dif­
ferent things depending on whether the person is assuming an atomistically sharp crack 
(linear elastic solutions that gave us KI ) or not (like the prefactor of the hole in a plate 
discussed in PS5.)

3.  For a single material (which follows Paris Law steady-state crack propagation with m = 2
), 
you  have  tested  three  components  with  initial  crack  sizes  a  which  failed  with  ﬁnal  crack 
◦
sizes af  (listed in the table below). 
(a)  Assume the fatigue conditions of all components are uniaxial loading with R = −1 at a 
maximum stress of 100 MPa and a frequency f  of 10 Hz.  Draw σ(t) for two complete 
loading cycles, and also draw the representative volume elements and associated stress 
states at the minimum and maximum σ(t). 

Solution: 

Figure 1: Uniaxial fatigue loading to σmax  = 100 MPa at f  = 10 Hz. 

(b)  Compare  the  differences  in  fatigue  lifetimes  for  the  three  components.  Explain  your 
ﬁndings in terms of crack growth rates.  From this, what do you infer about how growth 
of cracks should be monitored in a material component put into application?

Solution:  By  integrating  the  Paris  Law  for  steady-state  fatigue  crack  growth,  we  ﬁnd 
that  the cyclic  lifetime of a material Nf  is proportional  to  the  initial crack size a  and

Assuming  the  stress  range  is  the  same  for  each  component,  from  this  we  see  from  the 
case where the initial crack lengths are different but the ﬁnal crack lengths are the same 
(components A & B), an  initial  crack  four  times  smaller  results  in a 375%  increase  in 
cyclic  lifetime.  However  in  the  case  where  the  initial  crack  lengths  are  the  same  but 
ﬁnal crack lengths are different (components A & C), a ﬁnal crack length 4 times longer 
results only in a 19% increase in cyclic lifetime. These results show that crack growth is 
faster for larger cracks and that cyclic lifetime is most sensitive to the initial crack size. 
Mathematically, one can see this in the natural log dependence of initial/ﬁnal crack sizes 
on Nf  for  the m  = 2  solution  of Paris’ Law.  Therefore,  when  a material  experiences 
fatigue  loading  in  an  application  and  a  crack  is  visible  to  the  eye,  it  must  be  closely 
monitored because most of the cycles to failure will have been used to grow the crack to 
a visible size. 

(c)  Comment on  the average  stress applied  to  this material,  and why  this  is not counter  to 
the reality that fatigue failure still occurs in all of these components. 
Solution:  The  average  stress  for  R  =  −1  is  necessarily  zero,  since  you  are  cycling 
the material  between  equal/opposite  tensile  and  compressive  stress.  However,  a  time-
averaged stress of zero still results in fatigue failure because the crack will open a por­
tion  da  for  every  incremental  cylce  dN  if  the  crack  growth  conditions  are  within  the 
Paris  law,  steady-state  crack  growth  regime.  For  every  maximum  tensile  load  cycle 
achieved, the crack will be under a driving force to open the crack faces. Also, although 
it  may  seem  counterintuitive,  it  has  been  shown  experimentally  that  cracks  can  also 
propagate  under  compressive  loading  because  the  plastic  zone  ahead  of  the  crack  tip 
can be sufﬁciently strained to attain the compressive fracture stress. 

4.  With your special  topic group, please prepare slides for a short presentation of your  topic  to 
the  class,  to  be  delivered  on  Tuesday,  May  13.  A  template  will  be  posted  for  your  conve­
nience on the wiki.  Be as creative as you like, but please adhere to the guidelines to provide 
uniformity of details and keep to our time constraints. 
Reminder  that you will need  to  respond  to 2 of 3 wiki questions on  the  last quiz  (i.e., 2  that 
are  not  your  own  special  topic).  The  questions  will  be  based  on  content  delivered  in  these 
presentations  and  related  lecture/pset material  from  the  semester.  However,  you  will  likely 
ﬁnd it helpful and enjoyable to peruse the wiki pages of your colleagues to see more than they 
will have time to share in class.
