Problem Set #2 
Due: Tuesday, March 4 by 5:00 PM 

1.  You  did  such  an  outstanding  job  in  the  engineering  department  at  Unique  Unicycles  that 
they  gave  you  a  promotion  to  the R&D  department.  Your  ﬁrst  assignment  there  is  to  study 
a  new  material  developed  by  your  competitors  Un-Unique  Unicycles.  The  materials  is  a 
composite  composed  of  unidirectional  ﬁbers  in  a  polymer  matrix  (Fig.  1).  While  another 
research scientists determines what the ﬁbers and matrix are made of, your boss Dr. Van Vliet 
asks you to determine the stiffness tensor components for such a structure in terms of Young’s 
Modulus and Poisson’s ratio. 

Figure 1: A composite material comprised of unidirectional ﬁbers in a matrix. 

2.  Two  isotropic  materials  (A  &  B)  are  being  considered  for  use  in  shoe  insoles.  When  used 
as insoles the average strain with respect to time �(t) of the materials is that presented in the 
spreadsheet posted on the MIT Server  ( 2-2.xls). 

(a)  Derive a model that accurately describes each material’s response the the applied stress. 
Plot the result of your model and the given data. 
(b)  Characterize  these materials,  focusing  on  their  elastic moduli  and  the  relaxation  time. 
Without having handled the materials, what class would each fall into? 
(c)  Which material is better suited for the job? Explain by showing the σ (t) (given that you 
take a step every second) and the resulting strain for each material. Deﬁne a quantity for 
judging the effectiveness of each material in this application.  What would this quantity 
be for a material ideally suited for this application? 
(d)  A  similar  concept  can  be  applied  to measure  the  natural  frequency  of molecular  chain 
rotation  at  the  glass  transition  temperature  of  a  polymer.  Explain  how  you  do  this  ex­
perimentally and the results you would expect. 

3.  You are  responsible  for performing uniaxial  tensile  tests on  three very different materials:  a 
316 stainless steel alloy, alumina (Al2O3 ), and high density polyethylene (HDPE). However, 
before performing  the actual  tests,  you are asked  to predict what  the elastic  stress vs.  strain 
responses of each of the materials based on the mechanical properties of these materials doc­
umented  in  the  literature  (e.g.,  material  property  databases  such  as  matweb.com,  linked  on 
the MIT Server.) 

(a)  Graph  the  engineering  and  true  stress  (MPa)  versus  engineering  and  true  strain  (%) 
response  for  all  three materials  on  a  single  graph,  up  to  an  applied  engineering  strain 
value of .01 (or 1%) in strain increments of 0.0005.

yxz(b)  Remark on the differences in behaviors seen for each of the three materials as related to 
their  relevant mechanical  properties.  Also,  looking  at  the magnitude  of  the  stresses  at 
the maximum applied  strain,  do you expect  all of  these materials  to deform elastically 
up  to  these  strains?  If not, what was  the  fallacy  in  solely using Hooke’s  law  to predict 
the stress-strain behaviors for each of the materials? 
(c)  All three samples were given to you as cylinders with identical initial dimensions of 10 
cm  length  and  2  cm  diameter.  Show whether  a  uniaxial  load  frame  of maximum  load 
capability =  100  kN  (standard  capabilities  of  load  frames  such  as  Instrons  available  at 
MIT) will be sufﬁcient to deform all three materials to the requested engineering normal 
strain of 1%. Here, neglect the possibility that the materials might not remain intact (all 
in one piece) to that applied strain. 

4.  Atomic interactions can be modeled using a variety of potential energy approximations.  One 
very common potential form is the Lennard-Jones 6:12 potential: 
U (r) = 4�[(σ/r)12  − (σ/r)6 ] 

where � and σ are constants speciﬁc to a given material (note:  these terms are NOT equivalent 
to  stress  and  strain,  but  this  is  the  standard  notation  for  the  L-J  parameters).  Here,  r  is  the 
interatomic  spacing  given  in  units  of Angstroms,  and U (r)  is  given  in  units  of  eV  atom−1 . 
A molecular  dynamics  simulation was  performed  by  Zhang  and  coworkers  [1]  to  study  the 
properties  of  Al  thin  ﬁlms  in  which  the  authors  proposed  a  Lennard-Jones  potential  of  the 
form  above  to model Al-Al  interactions.  The  values  used  for  the material  parameters were: 
� = 0.368 and σ = 2.548 (we’ve rounded off the values in the paper for your problem set). 

(a)  What are the assumed units of � and σ in Zhang and coworkers’ potential for aluminum? 
(b)  Using  the  given  material  parameters  and  the  form  of  the  interatomic  potential  energy 
curve,  plot  U (r)  for  aluminum  from  r  = 0  to  3.5  Angstroms  in  increments  of  < 
0.25 Angstroms. 
(c)  Determine  the  equation  for  and  graph  the  interatomic  forces  F  as  a  function  of  inter­
atomic separation r  for Al over the same range of r used in part (a), indicating units of 
F (r). Also, analytically and graphically determine the equilibrium interatomic spacing, 
ro . Mark this point on both the graphs produced in parts (a) and (b). 
(d)  Compare  this  equilibrium  interatomic  spacing  to  the  literature  value  of  atomic  radius 
for aluminum, and from that comparison explain what you think Zhang and coworkers 
assumed in choosing the constants � and σ  that made ro  come out this way. 
(e)  Figure 2 shows interatomic energy curves [V (r) is equivalent to our U (r)] for Mg that 
were  calculated  by  Chavarria  [2]  (squares)  and  McMahan  and  coworkers  [3]  (dotted 
and  solid  curve).  These  data  are  shown  in  arbitrary  units  (a.u.)  which  is  typical  of 
computational/experimental results  that have funny units peculiar  to  the computational 
programming units, but r  turns out  to be expressed  in ∼  2 × Angstroms  (i.e., 9 a.u.  = 
4.5 Angstroms).  Comparing these curves with that calculated in part (a) for Al, explain 
whether  you would  expect magnesium  to  have  a  lower  or  higher  elastic modulus  than 
aluminum?  Is  this conﬁrmed by  the  literature values of elastic properties and physical 
properties of Al and Mg?

han and coworkers [3] (dotted and solid curves). 

(f)  Again,  considering  the  relationship  between  the Young’s modulus,  the  equilibrium  in­
teratomic spacing, and U (r) curvature, what effect do you think temperature has on the 
measured Young’s modulus?  Provide  a  conceptual  explanation of your  answer.  (Hint: 
Think about what happens to atoms inside of a material as you heat it up.)

5.  As  discussed  in  lecture,  the Worm  Like  Chain  (WLC)  model  of  rubber  elasticity  has  been 
used  to  analyze  the  deformation  of  DNA  under  uniaxial  loading.  Bouchiat  and  coworkers 
used  magnetic  tweezers  to  extend  lambda-DNA  (λ-DNA)  and  applied  the  WLC  model  to 
infer  its  structure  and  resistance  to  bending.  Table  1  is  a  subset  of  the  experimental  data 
Bouchiat  and  coworkers  reported,  with  additional  points  (Bouchiat  et  al.,Biophys  J.  (1999) 
Fig.  2). Apply the WLC model to determine the following: 

(a)  Graph these experimentally measured data as force on the chain vs.  stretch of the chain, 
Fc  vs.  λc  =  r/r where r  is  the distance between chain ends before  force  is applied, 
◦
◦
and  indicate  the  region  over which  the  experimentally measured  data  is  ﬁt  reasonably 
well by the WLC model. 
(b)  The number of nucleotides in this λ-DNA. 
(c)  The  number  of  nucleotides  that  comprise  a  segment  of  the  DNA  that  is  signiﬁcantly 
resistant to bending. 
(d)  The effective entropic spring constant of λ-DNA, ks .  Note  that  this  is often deﬁned as 
the  resistance  to  extension  at  large  forces  –  why  is  this?  Compare  your  value  to  that

stated by  the Bouchiat and coworkers, and explain why  they expressed  this stiffness  in

DNA?
