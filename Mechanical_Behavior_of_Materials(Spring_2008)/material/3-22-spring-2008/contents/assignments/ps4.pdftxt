Problem Set #4 
Due: Tuesday, April 15 by 5:00 PM 

1.  A  non-planar  dislocation  loop  is  shown  in  the  diagram  below.	 Each  of  the  dislocation  seg­
ments  lies  parallel  to  one  of  the  coordinate  axes.  The  segment  AB  is  a  left-handed  screw 
dislocation. 

(a)  Identify  the  character  (positive  edge,  negative  edge,  right-handed  screw  (RHS),  left-
handed screw (LHS)) of each segment of the dislocation loop. 
(b)  A positive shear stress τzx  = τxz  is applied.  Indicate the direction of the Peach-Koehler 
force for each segment, and list those segments for which the force is zero. 

2.  Solute strengthening includes a point defect-based obstacle to dislocation motion, where this 
obstacle  is an  impurity or solute atom  in  the ”host” or ”matrix” crystal  lattice.  Those  taking 
3.21 in parallel have already considered the equilibrium situation of a solute atom interacting 
with  an  edge  dislocation  self-stress  ﬁeld  (Ballufﬁ,  Allen  &  Carter,  Kinetics  of  Materials; 
Section 3.5.2). Here, we will continue the kinetic consequences of this analysis. 

(a)  Assume  a  point  defect  to  be  well-represented  by  an  elastic  sphere  of  effective  radius 
r(1 + δ),  where  r  is  the  radius  of  the  host  lattice  (or  matrix)  atom  and  δ  is  the  posi­
tive/negative difference between the solute and matrix atomic radii.  Note that δ  is pos­
itive if the solute atom exceeds the host atom in size; and negative if the solute atom is 
smaller. Assuming the atomic size mismatch is sufﬁciently small, let the solute atom be 
a substitutional  impurity  in  the  lattice,  and express  the change  in volume at  that  lattice 
site ΔV  due to replacing a lattice vacancy (the volume of the missing atom in the host 
lattice) with a solute atom, in terms of the solute atom radius and induced strain �. 
(b)  Cottrell considered  the equilibrium position or “atmosphere” of  the solute atom due  to 
the  self-stress  of  a  dislocation,  as  a  function  of  distance  from  the  dislocation  core.  In 
general,  the  elastic  strain  energy  Ue  of  the  crystal  increases  as  a  pΔV  term,  where  p 
is  equal  to  the  hydrostatic  stress  acting  on  that  point-defected  volume ΔV .  Using  the 
elastic solutions to dislocation self-stress and the deﬁnition of hydrostatic stress, graph 
the hydrostatic isostress contours as a function of (x, y) or (r, θ) distance around both an 
edge dislocation core and around a screw dislocation core.  (Mathematica, Matlab, etc. 
are handy rendering programs for analytical equations.)  Here, you can use the required

ABCDEFGHzxystructural and elastic  constants  for bcc  (also called α-phase) Fe.  Cottrell combined  all 
these  structural/elastic  terms  into  a  constant,  such  that  Ue  was  reduced  to  a  material-
dependent constant modifying a dependence on just θ! and r . 
(c)  From  the above graphs,  show  the most energetically stable  location of a smaller solute 
atom  like  C  in  terms  of  θ ,  the  angular  position  deﬁned  by  your  coordinate  system  at 
the  edge  and  screw  dislocation  cores.  (Aside:  Note  that  the  above  analysis  was  for 
a  substitutional  atom,  but  C  is  in  fact  an  interstitial  defect  in  Fe;  this  point  is  usually 
neglected  in  analysis  of  point-line  defect  interactions,  but  does  affect  the  number  of 
lattice points available to both species.) 
(d)  The equilibrium or steady-state concentration of solute atoms as a function of distance 
from the dislocation core can be predicted from thermodynamics, based on an Arrhenius 
dependence  on  the  core-distance-dependent  energy  barrier Ue .  Predict  this  concentra­
tion  at  a  location  (0,  -b)  from  the  core  of  a  positive  edge  dislocation  in  Fe  at  room 
temperature  (300 K), assuming  that  the concentration of C solute  far  from  the disloca­
tion  is  0.1%  and  that  the  binding  energy  of  C  to  the  edge  dislocation  core  is  0.5  eV. 
Explain implications in terms of distribution of the C solute within the Fe lattice. 
(e)  Cottrell  considered  these  interactions  even  before  dislocations  were  observed,  so  he 
analyzed  the  effect  of  any  applied  pressure  on  the  solute  atom.  Use  Peach-Koehler  to 
take  the  opposite  view:  What  is  the  driving  force  for  glide  and/or  climb  due  to  the 
hydrostatic pressure created by the solute atom that is located at (0, -b) from a positive 
edge dislocation core and from a positive screw dislocation core? 
(f)  Now  as  the  dislocation  glides  under  applied  shear  stress  on  its  slip  plane,  the  role  of 
C  in  solute  strengthening  depends  on  a  competition  between  solute  diffusion  (keep­
ing  up  with  the  core)  and  maintained  dislocation  velocity.  For  example,  if  diffusion 
times/distances  are  comparable  to  glide  times/distances,  the  C  will  keep  up  with  the 
core  and  continue  to  impede  glide.  This  is  called  dynamic  strain  aging,  and  leads  to 
serrated  yielding  in  unaxial  tension  (stress  above  yield  point  dropping  as  dislocations 
break  free of solute;  and  increasing as solute diffuses back  to  the core.  How  fast/far  is 
that?  Here, we make analogy to Cottrell’s classic strain aging argument, which showed 
scaling between  the time required for a moving solute atom  to diffuse into a stationary 
dislocation core  (opposite case  to our dynamic  strain aging),  show how  the concentra­
tion  or  number  of  solute  atom  obstacles  at  the  bcc  Fe  dislocation  core  depends  on  the 
diffusion time t of the C solute (see BAC’s KoM). Then compare this time for a solute 
atom to diffuse a distance |b| with the time it takes for a dislocation to move a distance 
|b| for a typical metal (see your Orowan strain rate solution from PS3). 
3.  We discussed how two edge dislocations could intersect, resulting in an edge-type jog in one 
of them.  Show whether it is possible for pure (edge or screw) dislocations to intersect in such 
a way that would result in formation of a sessile kink in either of the two dislocations.  These 
could be two edges, two screws, or one edge/one screw. 

4.  You are given an Al- 2 at.% Cu alloy where the Cu is in solution with the Al.  Your boss then 
asks you to make the material as strong as possible. 

(a)  Before  you  do  anything  to  the  material,  ﬁrst  estimate  the  amount  of  solute  (in  at.%) 
necessary to put one solute atom at each site along all of the dislocations in the sample.

This will give you an idea of how much solute is necessary to strengthen the material by 
solute alone. 
(b)  If  you  anneal  the  alloy  at  400  ◦C,  schematically  show  a  plot  of  temperature  vs.  time, 
particle size r vs.  time, particle spacing L vs.  time, and yield strength vs.  particle size. 
(Treat any additional equilibrium phases in a continuum manner ignoring interfaces and 
atomic  structure.)  In  the  last  plot,  describe  the  different  strengthening  mechanisms, 
including relative magnitudes, the would be the effective mechanisms at different times. 
(c)  Suppose  instead  of  an  alloy,  you  started  with  a  composite  of  Al  with  Al2O3  particles 
dispersed in it.  (Assume the volume fraction of the particles is the same as the particles 
in  part  (b).)  How  would  you  expect  the  maximum  yield  strength  to  change  and  the 
particle size r at which this maximum occurs to change relative to the metal alloy case? 
Show this on a yield strength vs.  particle size graph for both materials. 

5.  No new wiki work before Quiz 2; will resume  in PS5.  Where are we going with  this?  Each 
team will present a 15 minute discussion of the special topic during lecture at  the end of the 
term, summarizing key mechanical behavior topics covered in the wiki over the term.  Three 
of  these  topics  will  be  chosen  at  random  to  be  included  on  Quiz  3,  and  you’ll  answer  2  of 
them (one cannot be from your own team). You may want to start discussing how you’ll plan 
to do this short presentation.
