Problem Set #3 
Due:  Friday, March 21 by 5:00 PM 

1.  Because metallic glasses have an amorphous atomic structure, many researchers believe they 
cannot “strain harden” like their crystalline counterparts (a topic we will cover in depth later). 
At present, you can understand  this  to mean  that  the stress required  to continue deformation 
of  the  material  to  strains  greater  than  the  yield  strain  �(σy )  increases  monotonically,  often 
modeled as a power-law of the form σ = K �n
p  where �p  is the plastic strain, n is the material 
strain  hardening  exponent,  and K  is  a material  constant  related  to σy .  In  other words,  after 
yielding  the  material  becomes  “harder  (i.e.  more  difﬁcult)  to  strain.”  Regardless  of  this 
assumption, you decide to have a UROP in your group conduct some experiments to consider 
whether strain hardening does occur in a particular metallic glass you have synthesized.  You 
have  the UROP  compress  a  cylindrical  sample  of  bulk metallic  glass  that  is  6 mm  long  and 
3  mm  in  diameter  to  failure.  After  the  tests,  the  UROP  excitedly  presents  the  data  to  you 
(which  can be  found  in 3-1.xls ),  claiming  to have proven with  these data  that  strain 
hardening  in  metallic  glasses  is  possible!  As  she  hyperventilates  talking  about  the  Nature 
article she wants to write, you realize that she is wrong (most likely because she did not have 
the opportunity to yet take 3.22). 
(a)  Explain why she is wrong.  Do this by calculating and discussing the σ − � response(s) 
and the strain hardening exponent n for the material. Compare your results with what is 
expected of a material that does strain harden. 
(b)  Determine the elastic and plastic strain at failure. 
(c)  Not  one  to  give  up  easily,  you  think  that  you may  be  able  to  get  the metallic  glass  to 
strain harden by applying a cyclic load (with the minimum load being 0 N) through the 
plastic region. Show what the resulting stress-strain curve would look like if you applied 
three cycles before failure. 
2.  You are given a material and told that it is elastically isotropic and exhibits a yield strength σy 
������� 
������� 
of 950 MPa.  The material  is being used  in an application where  it experiences a stress state 
of

(a)  According to the von Mises and Tresca criteria, respectively, does the material yield? 
(b)  Plot the yield surfaces (on the same graph) of the material based on the von Mises and 
Tresca criteria. 
(c)  You decide to examine the material more closely by performing your own uniaxial ten­
sion and compression tests. The stress-strain data for these tests are found in  3-2.xls . 
Plot  these data on  the same graph as you made  in  (b).  Discuss how  the von Mises and 
Tresca criteria predict yielding  in  the material.  Is  there a better criterion  to use for  this 
material? Explain.

3.  Noting  that  the  von  Mises  and  Tresca  criteria  deviate  for  speciﬁc  stress  states  in  the  yield 
surface considered above, determine the following:

(a)  The stress tensor σij  corresponding to the stress state(s) at which there is maximal dif­
ference between  these  two yield  criteria,  expressed  as  a matrix  and  as  a  representative 
volume  element  (RVE)  of  the material.  This will  correspond  to  the  biggest  gap(s)  be­
tween these two predictions in the graphical yield surface. 
(b)  The  magnitude  of  this  difference,  expressed  ﬁrst  in  terms  of  an  algebraic  expression 
including the σy  of the material and second in terms of a percentage basis [%]. 
(c)	 Which  of  these  two  criteria more  accurately  predicts  the  stress  states  corresponding  to 
material  yielding  in  pure metals  and metallic  alloys,  and  why  does  this  tend  to  be  the 
more accurate predictor? To answer this, you will need to rely on and show/cite experi­
mental data for selected materials. 

4.  The yield strength σy  of many materials  is poorly described by von Mises and Tresca;  these 
include porous materials, glassy polymers, granular media, and biological materials. For such 
materials, σy  depends  in part on  the state of hydrostatic stress σii  and  thus  the ﬁrst  invariant 
of σij , I1 . Here, you will explore some of these pressure-sensitive yield criteria. 

(a)  Mohr  and  Coulomb  discussed  continuum mechanics  and  particle  interactions,  respec­
tively.  Their  ideas  enabled modiﬁcation  of  the  yield  criteria  to  reﬂect  the  fact  that  σy 
may  differ  in  uniaxial  tension  vs.  compression.  This  criterion  is  commonly  used  for 
bulk metallic glass and soils, which fail at lower applied stresses in tension than in com­
pression.  It  linearly  relates  the  effect  of  superposed  normal  and  shear  stresses  on  the 
stress state  required  to yield  the material, and Mohr’s circle helps us easily understand 
this.  Assume an  imposed principal stress state  in a material plane; Mohr-Coulomb ex­
presses  the  yield  criteria  in  terms  of  the  stress  state  at  maximal  shear  stress  resulting 
from σ1  and σ3 , and can be expressed as the material yielding when: 

τ  =< σ > sin  α	

(1) 

where < σ >  is  the  average  normal  stress  corresponding  to  τ ,  and  (τ , <  σ  >)  is  the 
coordinate on Mohr’s circle deﬁned at the point of max shear stress for deﬁned σ1  >  0 
and σ3  >  0, and α  is  the friction angle.  Physically, α  is  the angle  that would naturally 
arise  if  you  poured  the  granular  material  onto  a  surface  due  to  friction  between  the 
particles, and is usually between 15o  and 50o .  In terms of Mohr’s circle,  it is the angle 
between  the  vertical  line  connecting  (τ , < σ  >)  to  the  τ  = 0  horizontal  axis,  and  the 
tangent of  the circle  that  intersects  the point (τ  = 0, σ  =  0).  Draw  this Mohr’s circle, 
and  restate  the Mohr-Coulomb  yield  criterion  only  in  terms  of  these  normal  principal 
stresses and the material friction angle. 
(b)  Drucker and Prager developed the creatively named Drucker-Prager yield criterion orig­
inally  for soil mechanics and  it  is often applied  to composite materials such as cement 
� 
or concrete.  It accounts for normal and shear stresses, and can be stated as: 
f  =  J2  − αI1  − k	
where J2  is the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor sij  and α and k are mate­
rial properties that reﬂect the friction angle and cohesion, respectively. When f  reaches 
a critical value corresponding to yielding under a uniaxial stress state, the material will

yield.  Express  f  in  terms  of  the  stresses  σij  that  deﬁne  I1  and  J2 ,  and  determine  the 
value of f (α, k) that corresponds to yielding under an applied uniaxial stress state. 
(c)  Mohr-Coulomb  and Drucker-Prager  are  similar  in  relation  to  each  other  as Tresca  and 
von  Mises.  Both  account  for  superposed  normal  and  shear  stresses,  but  one  is  more 
conservative  than  the  other.  Graphically  represent  the M-C  and D-P  yield  locii  on  the 
same σ1/σy  vs.  σ2/σy  graph, and state why one  is more conservative  than  the other  in 
predicting yielding of pressure-sensitive materials. 

5.  Material stiffness and strength are very different properties attributed to very different atom­
istic  mechanisms.  In  60  words  or  less  (think  elevator  conversation),  clearly  and  accurately 
state the difference between these two concepts in a way that should be perfectly clear to any 
engineer, physicist, or chemist. 

6.  We have discussed that dislocations move in response to shear stresses less than the theoretical 
shear  strength  of  a  crystal,  and  that  the  motion  of  each  dislocation  contributes  unit  slip  of 
magnitude |b|. 
(a)  Express the plastic shear strain γ p  that would result from a single edge dislocation glid­
ing  along  its  slip  plane  all  the  way  to  the  free  surface.  Here,  consider  a  rectangular 
single crystal block of height h, width across the page w and depth into the page L; ﬁrst 
express γ p (b, h) and then express γ p (A, V ) where A is the glide plane area and V  is the 
volume of the block. 
(b)  Now  consider  a  single  edge  dislocation  in  the  center  of  the  perfect  rectangular-prism 
box, gliding by an  incremental slip  inside  the block dx.  Express  the  incremental shear 
strain dγ p  in terms of b, L, dx and V . 
(c)  Now  consider  the  case  of  n  dislocations,  and  express  this  incremental  shear  strain  in 
terms of  dislocation density ρ  (which  is  always deﬁned  as  total dislocation  line  length 
per unit volume of material), b and the incremental slip dx. 
(d)  Finally,  express  the  time  derivative  of  dγ p  in  terms  of  the  time  derivative  of  displace­
ment  dx/dt.  You  will  have  derived  the  Orowan  equation,  which  predicts  the  plastic 
shear strain rate possible in a material of known dislocation density, Burgers vector, and 
dislocation velocity v. 
(e)  Assume  dislocation  velocity  is  equivalent  to  the  speed  of  sound  in  Cu,  and  determine 
the plastic shear strain rate magnitude for annealed, single crystal Cu.
