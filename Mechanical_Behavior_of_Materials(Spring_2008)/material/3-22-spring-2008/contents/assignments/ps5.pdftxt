Problem Set #5 
Due:  Friday, May 2 by 5:00 PM 

1.  The data  in  the supplementary spreadsheet	 5-1.xls  is obtained  from creep experiments on 
a polycrystalline oxide with a grain size of 10 µm. 

(a)  Make  a  plot  of  log  (strain  rate)  versus  log  (stress)  for  the  three  temperatures.  Identify 
on your plot  the regions  that correspond  to diffusional creep and  those  that correspond 
to power-law creep. At what stress and temperature does the transition from dislocation 
climb to a mechanism that does not require dislocations occur? 
(b)  Does  the mechanism  that does not  require dislocations correspond  to Nabarro-Herring 
creep or to Coble creep? 
(c)  Plot  the  strain  rate  versus  stress  at  1700 K  for  this material  at  the  grain  size  of  1  µm, 
10  µm  and  100  µm.  How  does  the  change  in  grain  size  affect  the  transition  point  be­
tween dislocation climb and the mechanism you named in part (b)? 
(d)  Using  the  constitutive  equations  for  Nabarro-Herring  and  Coble  creep,  show  how  the 
barrier  in  a  deformation  mechanism  map  between  the  two  would  change  with  grain 
size. 
(e)  Schematically  draw  a  deformation mechanism map  (σ/G  vs.  T /Tm )  for  this material 
with a grain size of 10 µm.  Clearly label the mechanism that dominates in the different 
regimes.  Using the information you learned in parts (c) and (d), show on this deforma­
tion mechanism map  how  the  boundaries  between  these  regimes would  change with  a 
change in grain size to 1 µm and 100 µm. 
(f)  How would the creep activation barrier change (higher or lower?)  and the deformation 
mechanism map  change  in  this material  if  it was  an  amorphous  oxide?  Explain.  How 
would the activation barrier (higher or lower?) be different between an amorphous oxide 
and amorphous metal? Explain. 

2.  Ice  is  a  hydrogen-bonded  crystalline  material  that  creeps  appreciably,  especially  under  the 
high stresses and potentially high temperatures characteristic of polar ice caps and glaciers. 

(a)  Consider a portion of a polar  ice cap  that  is under an  in-plane equibiaxial compressive 
stress of 10 MPa at -50oC. What is the maximum shear stress imposed on the ice by this 
stress state? 
(b)  Referring  to  the  deformation  mechanism  map  below,  what  is  the  strain  rate  dγ /dt  we 
would  expect  this  polar  ice  cap  region  to  exhibit  under  the  conditions  deﬁned  in  (a)? 
Clearly  state  any  assumptions  of  ice  cap  geometry  and  relevant  physical/mechanical 
properties.  (A  cool,  relatively  recent  paper  on  ice  mechanics  is  Elvin  et  al.,  J.  Eng. 
Mech.  Jan (1998); check out the author afﬁliations.) 
(c)  Assuming the applied stress on the ice cap remains constant, and the polar ice cap ambi­
ent temperature increases to the highest magnitude currently predicted by climatologists, 
what is the % difference in creep rate with respect to a current temperature of -50oC? 
(d)  Assuming the ice cap is already in stage II creep in 2008 and this worst-case temperature 
is  achieved  this  year,  how  long  will  it  take  for  a  polar  ice  cap  of  this  grain  size  and 
thickness of 50 cm to shrink in in-plane dimensions by 50%?

3.  What are  the units for energy release rate?  Explain  thoroughly, yet concisely, what  is meant 
by “rate”  in  this context?  Explain how  this  relates  to  the material property of  toughness.  In 
general,  rank  the classes of materials  (metallic,  ceramic,  and polymeric)  from  the highest  to 
lowest energy release rate by using speciﬁc, cited examples from literature.

4.  Calculation of the stress as a function from distance from an elliptical through-thickness crack 
a ). 
tip  of width  2a  and  tip  radius R was  given  in  class  but  not  derived,  as  σ  =  σo (1 + 2  R
The  derivation  includes  solution  of  a  biharmonic  equation  of  elasticity,  the  wise  selection 
of  an  appropriate  Airy  stress  function  χ  that  maintains  continuity  and  strain  compatibility 
across the crack face, and complex variables; this is the same approach used to solve the self-
stress  around  an  edge  dislocation.  You  could  do  it,  but  it’s  typically  treated  in  an  advanced 
mechanical  behavior  class.  To  put  things  in  perspective,  this was  solved  in  1913  by  Inglis, 
when analytical elastic mechanics was the only game in town. 

(a)  The  solution  is  a  twist  on  the  so-called  Eshelby  inclusion  problem,  or  the  effects  of 
stress due  to  a  spherical hole  (or particle) of  radius R  =  a  inside  a material deformed 
under unaxial stress σo .  It  is derived  in polar coordinates r  (distance from hole center) 
and  θ  (in-plane  angle  around  hole  center),  and  has  the  nice  result  of  being  bounded  at 
the  maximum  to  some  ﬁnite  stress.  Let’s  work  on  part  of  this  to  understand  why  the 
stress concentration  is bounded  to be  lower  than  inﬁnity  for a circular ﬂaw:  The stress 
distribution σij  given by this internal defect is:

Given  that  you  expect  the  stress  to  be  maximized  along  the  equator  of  the  hole  (i.e., 
orthogonal  to  the  loading axis), use  the above expressions  to ﬁnd  the magnitude of  the 
maximum stress component in terms of only the applied stress σ .  In other words, what is 
the numerical, maximum stress concentration factor due to this circular ﬂaw? Graphing 
σij  may help illustrate this. 
(b)  Now let us assume the crack is a through-thickness, sharp crack as Grifﬁth considered, 
and the material is amorphous silica for which others have reported γsurf  and E . What 
is the fracture stress σf  if this silica initially contained defects of length 2a = 1 mm? 
(c)  If your application required a fracture strength of 1 GPa and you could chemically mod­
ify  any  internal  ﬂaw  surfaces  in  the  above  silica  via  chemical  vapor  deposition,  what 
would the target surface tension be?  Is this reasonably achievable? 

5.  Please see comments and address new questions related to special topics wiki, which will be 
posted  by  Friday  4/25  night  (after DMSE  social).  Also  note  that  this will  be  the  ﬁnal wiki 
pset  assignment.  Next  week  you  will  be  preparing  a  short  presentation  for  the  class,  to  be 
delivered on May 8 (R) or May 13 (T).
