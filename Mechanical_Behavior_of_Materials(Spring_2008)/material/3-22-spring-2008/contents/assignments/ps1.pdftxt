3.22  Mechanical  Behavior  of  Materials  (Spring  2008) 

Problem Set #1 
Due: Monday, February 25 by 5:00 PM 

1.  The beauty of a bicycle wheel design  is that the spokes  (narrow cylindrical wires connecting 
the wheel center to the perimeter) are loaded in tension, despite the compressive force exerted 
via  the bicyclist’ s weight.  Consider  a stainless  steel  spoke with a diameter of 2 mm, under  a 
1000 N (224 lbf) load. 

(a)  What is the (tensile) stress on the spoke? 
(b)  What  is  the  elastic  strain  in  the  spoke,  given  that  approximation  of  the  stainless  steel 
as  a  linear  elastic  continuum  is  a  reasonable  approximation?  If  the  spoke  is  initially 
25.50 cm long, what is the spoke length under the maximum applied load? 
(c)  Why  would  it  be  a  bad  idea  to  place  the  spoke  under  a  compressive  load  of  1000  N? 
Explain this quantitatively, using the elastica. 
(d)  The  company  that  employs  you,	 Unique  Unicycles,  has  designed  a  new  bicycle  that 
requires  the  spokes  be  loaded  in  compression.  Design  an  alternative  circular  spoke 
made  of  stainless  steel  that  is  able  to  carry  the  same  load  and  yet  is  a  reasonable  size 
and weight for the bicycle (e.g., within 25% of the initial spoke weight). 

2.  Spokes  are  typically  made  by  drawing  a  billet  of  stainless  steel  through  a  die  to  reduce  its 
diameter.  During this type of processing  it is common for a preferred  crystallographic  orien­
tation  to develop  (e.g.  a texture), which is a speciﬁc  microstructural  term meaning alignment 
of  the  unit  cells’  orientation.  Assume  that  the  two  most  common  orientations  to  form  are 
<111> and <100>, aligned parallel to the long axis of the spoke (i.e., either the (111) or the 
(100) is aligned normal to the spoke long axis. 

(a)  Suppose  for  a  bicycle  wheel,  it  is  desirable  to  maximize  the  stiffness  of  the  spokes. 
Which  crystallographic  orientation  is preferable?  (For simplicity,  use material  data  for 
Fe, the major element in stainless steel). 
(b)  Is  your  answer  to  part  (a)  the  same  if  you  were  to  manufacture  the  spokes  from Mo? 
Why or why not? 
(c)  In  a  unit  cell  of  Fe,  if  the  stress  calculated  in  question  1(a)  is  applied  in  a  direction 
normal to the (111) plane, what are the components of the stress on the {100} family of 
planes? 
(d)  To calculate the strain along these <100> directions, what other information would you 
need? 

3.  X-ray  diffraction  is  a  technique  commonly  used  to  measure  microscopic  elastic  strains  in 
crystalline metals.  These elastic strains alter the atomic plane spacing which can be measured 
by  Bragg’ s  Law.  Recently  Poulsen  and  coworkers  [Poulsen  et  al.,  Nature  Materials  4, 33  
(2005)]  have  shown  that  elastic  strains  in  amorphous  materials  can  also  be  measured  using 
similar methods.  However,  these materials  do not  have  atomic  planes,  so  instead  strains  are 
measured  by  the  pair  correlation  function,  which  is  a  measure  of  nearest-neighbor  atomic 
spacings.

of the two-dimensional diffraction pattern collected  [Poulsen et al., Nature Materials 4, 33 (2005)]. 
The broad  halo  is  indicative  of  scattering  from  an  amorphous  material.  Taking  a one-dimensional 
slice  from  the  center  of  the  pattern  out  to  the  edge  yields  a plot  of  intensity  as  a  function  of  radial 
distance  as  shown  in  (C)  [Poulsen  et  al.,  Nature Materials  4,  33  (2005)].  The  position  of  the  ﬁrst 
peak is related to the nearest neighbor distances. 

(a)  Derive  a  strain  equation  for  this  technique,  analogous  to  the macroscopic  deﬁnition  of 
engineering  strain. 

(b)  Suppose  you  load  a  cylindrical  piece  of  Zr-based  metallic  glass  3  mm  in  diameter  in 
compression up to a load P  = 7500 N, stopping at speciﬁc 
ﬁx ed loads to record diffrac­
tion  data.  The  incident  beam  is  monochromatic  (E  =  80  keV)  and  the  scattering  is 
conducted  in a transmission  geometry with a two-dimensional  detector placed 400 mm 
downstream  from  your  sample  (Fig.  1A).  Figure  1B  is  an  example  of  the  diffraction 
patterns you collect.  The broad halo  is indicative of scattering  from an amorphous ma­
terial.  Because  you  used  high-energy  x-rays  and  a  two-dimensional  detector,  you  are 
able  to  differentiate  the  strain  along  ((cid:2))  and  normal  (⊥)  to  the  direction  of  loading  by 
measuring  the  radius  of  the  halo  along  these  two directions  (Fig. 1C). Table 1  lists  the 
peak radii along these directions  as a function of load.  Graph the strain as a function of 
applied stress along these two directions.  How could you extend this test to conﬁrm  that 
the deformation was purely elastic?

(c)  Compare  the  true vs.  engineering  strain  and  the  true  vs.  engineering  stress  at  the  state 
of maximum applied  load. 
(d)  Calculate  the Poisson’ s  ratio ν  and  the Young’ s  elastic modulus E of  the metallic glass 
continuum. 
(e)  What are the strains along the principle stress axes σi  during the peak compressive load? 
How would  you  construct  a  complete  strain  tensor  using  x-ray  diffraction?  Write  out 
the full small-strain  tensor ij  under uniaxial loading using as few variables as possible. 
(f)  What  would  the  resulting  diffraction  pattern  look  like  if  you  applied  a  shear  stress  τ ? 
a  hydrostatic  compressive  stress  σii?  (Please  show  this  by  drawing  a  schematic  XRD 
pattern, and comparing  it to the given, unstressed  state.)

4.  A plate of metallic glass is subjected  to the following plane strain state:  11 
23  = 13  = 33  = 0.  Determine  the  ratio of  the  stress  components  σ33 /σ11  in  terms of  the 
shear elastic modulus G and Poisson’ s ratio ν . 

5.  We  know  that  elastic  constants  are  expressed  as  4th  rank  tensors,  but  can  be  reduced  to  a 
matrix  of  only  36  components.  A  cubic  crystal  (simple  cubic,  body  centered  cubic,  or  face 
centered cubic) has three independent elastic constants, for example given as the stiffness ma­
trix elements C11 , C12 , and C44 . An isotropic continuum, which is what we’ ve approximated 
the stainless steel and amorphous metal to be in the above problems, has only two independent 
elastic constants, for example given as E and ν . By exerting stresses and symmetry operations 
on  such  a cubic  crystal,  prove how 3  independent  elastic  constants  can be  reduced  to only  2 
if the material is elastically  isotropic.
