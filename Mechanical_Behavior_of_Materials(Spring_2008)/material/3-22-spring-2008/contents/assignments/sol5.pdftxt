Problem Set #5 
Due:  Friday, May 2 by 5:00 PM 

1.  The data  in  the supplementary spreadsheet 
is obtained  from creep experiments on 
5-1.xls
a polycrystalline oxide with a grain size of 10 µm. 

(a)  Make  a  plot  of  log  (strain  rate)  versus  log  (stress)  for  the  three  temperatures.  Identify 
on your plot  the regions  that correspond  to diffusional creep and  those  that correspond 
to power-law creep. At what stress and temperature does the transition from dislocation 
climb to a mechanism that does not require dislocations occur? 

Solution:  The  plot  of  log  (strain  rate)  versus  log  (stress)  for  the  three  temperatures 
is  shown  below.  We  see  that  there  are  two  regimes  that  are  each  linear  but  that  have 
different slopes.  By plotting the data this way,  the slope is equal to the exponential de­
pendency n of the strain rate on stress.  In the lower stress regime, n = 1 corresponding 
to either Nabarro-Herring or Coble creep.  In  the higher stress regime, n  = 4.3 which 
suggests  power  law  creep  (or  dislocation  climb).  At  all  temperatures,  the  transition 
between the two regimes occurs at a stress of ∼ 40 MPa. 

(b)  Does  the mechanism  that does not  require dislocations correspond  to Nabarro-Herring 
creep or to Coble creep? 

Solution:  The steady-state creep rate of  these  two mechanisms differs  in activation en­
ergy and dependency on grain size.  Since we are not given any information about grain 
size, we should consider the activation energy, which is found from the slope of a plot of 
log  (strain rate) T−1  (shown below).  However  this only gives us a value of  the activa­
tion energy  for  this  regime.  In order  to  identify  it as Nabarro-Herring or Coble creep, 
we must  compare  it  against  a  value  of  a mechanism we  know,  such  as  the  dislocation 
climb  region  in  the  plot  of  part  (a).  The  activation  energy  for  dislocation  climb  is  the 
activation energy necessary to diffuse atoms through the lattice. This is the same activa­
tion energy  for Nabarro-Herring creep.  As shown  in  the plot below, we ﬁnd  the slopes 
of  these  two  regions  are  the  same,  so  we  can  say  that  this  regime  is  Nabarro-Herring 
creep.

10  µm  and  100  µm.  How  does  the  change  in  grain  size  affect  the  transition  point  be­
tween dislocation climb and the mechanism you named in part (b)? 

Solution:  See  the  graph  below.  We  assume  that  by  changing  the  grain  size we  remain 
within  the Nabarro-Herring creep regime.  Because  the strain rate of Nabarro-Herring 
goes  as  d−2  (d  =  grain  size),  the  Nabarro-Herring  portion  of  the  curve  will  increase 
or  decrease  100  fold  for  an  order  of  magnitude  decrease  or  increase,  respectively,  in 
grain  size.  The  dislocation  climb  region  however  will  remain  unchanged  since  it  has 
no  dependency  on  grain  size.  Therefore  the  stress  at  which  the  dominant  mechanism 
transitions from Nabarro-Herring creep to dislocation climb increases with decreasing 
grain size. 

(d)  Using  the  constitutive  equations  for  Nabarro-Herring  and  Coble  creep,  show  how  the 
barrier in a deformation mechanism map between the two would change with grain size. 

Solution:  This question  is  really asking how  the  temperature and  stress where  the  two 
mechanisms are the same varies with grain size. We can ﬁnd this by equating the strain

Therefore,  if  we  increase  the  grain  size,  the  boundary  between  these  two  regimes  will 
move to lower temperatures. 

We  also  see  from  this  analysis  that  the  stress  terms  cancel,  which  means  the  bound­
ary  is  a  vertical  line  and  therefore  the  grain  size  has  no  affect  on  the  position  of  the 
barrier along the stress axis. 
(e)  Schematically  draw  a  deformation mechanism map  (σ/G  vs.  T /Tm )  for  this material 
with a grain size of 10 µm.  Clearly label the mechanism that dominates in the different 
regimes.  Using the information you learned in parts (c) and (d), show on this deforma­
tion mechanism map  how  the  boundaries  between  these  regimes would  change with  a 
change in grain size to 1 µm and 100 µm. 

Solution:  In part (c), we showed that the boundary between Nabarro-Herring creep and 
dislocation  climb  shifts  to  higher  stresses with  decreasing  grain  size  (and  vice  versa). 
(This  is also  true  for Coble  creep).  In part  (d), we  showed  that  the boundary between 
Nabarro-Herring  and  Coble  creep  shifts  to  higher  temperature  with  decreasing  grain 
size (and vice versa).  Therefore the deformation mechanism map for 1 µm, 10 µm, and 
100 µm schematically looks similar to the one show below (taken from M.F. Ashby, Acta 
Metall.  20, 887 (1972))

CobleN-H(f)  How would the creep activation barrier change (higher or lower?)  and the deformation 
mechanism map  change  in  this material  if  it was  an  amorphous  oxide?  Explain.  How 
would the activation barrier (higher or lower?) be different between an amorphous oxide 
and amorphous metal? Explain. 

Solution: The activation energy is related to the difﬁculty associated with “rearranging” 
atoms  locally  in  the  structure.  It  is  easier  to  rearrange atoms  in amorphous materials 
because  of  the  higher  free  volume.  Therefore  the  activation  energy  in  an  amorphous 
oxide would be lower than that in a crystalline oxide with the same chemical composi­
tion.  Similarly, in an oxide the bonding is covalent, which is stronger than the metallic 
bonds found in a metal.  Therefore the activation energy in the amorphous metal would 
be lower than that in an amorphous oxide. 

With  regards  to  the  deformation  mechanism  map,  we  would  no  longer  see  regions  of 
power-law,  Nabarro-Herring,  or  Coble  creep;  regimes  associated  with  atomic  move­
ments in a polycrystalline atomic structure.  Instead, other mechanisms will be activated 
that contribute to the viscous ﬂow of the amorphous glass. 

2.  Ice  is  a  hydrogen-bonded  crystalline  material  that  creeps  appreciably,  especially  under  the 
high stresses and potentially high temperatures characteristic of polar ice caps and glaciers. 

(a)  Consider a portion of a polar  ice cap  that  is under an  in-plane equibiaxial compressive 
stress of 10 MPa at -50oC. What is the maximum shear stress imposed on the ice by this 
stress state? 
Solution:  Using  Mohr’s  circle,  the  maximum  shear  stress  is  the  average  of  10  and  0 
MPa, or 5 MPa. 
(b)  Referring  to  the  deformation  mechanism  map  below,  what  is  the  strain  rate  dγ /dt  we 
would  expect  this  polar  ice  cap  region  to  exhibit  under  the  conditions  deﬁned  in  (a)? 
Clearly  state  any  assumptions  of  ice  cap  geometry  and  relevant  physical/mechanical 
properties.  (A  cool,  relatively  recent  paper  on  ice  mechanics  is  Elvin  et  al.,  J.  Eng. 
Mech.  Jan (1998); check out the author afﬁliations.) 
Solution:  From  the  given  paper  and  other  sources,  G  of  ice  is  approximately  3  GPa. 
Interestingly, this is similar to the stiffness of amorphous, glassy polymers. The normal­
ized shear stress is then 5 MPa/3 GPa = 10−3.  At the given temperature, the ice is in a 
regime of power-law creep dominated by dislocation climb. 
(c)  Assuming the applied stress on the ice cap remains constant, and the polar ice cap ambi­
ent temperature increases to the highest magnitude currently predicted by climatologists, 
what is the % difference in creep rate with respect to a current temperature of -50oC? 
Solution:  The  creep  rate  at  the  given  temp  is  about  10−8/s.  If  the  polar  regions  of 
the Earth warmed by 10oC, a severe prediction by climatologists,  the creep rate would 
increase about an order of magnitude and could shift into the diffusional ﬂow regime. 
(d)  Assuming the ice cap is already in stage II creep in 2008 and this worst-case temperature 
is  achieved  this  year,  how  long  will  it  take  for  a  polar  ice  cap  of  this  grain  size  and 
thickness of 50 cm to shrink in in-plane dimensions by 50%?

Solution: For a total strain of 0.5 and a creep rate of 10−9/s, it would take about 109 s, 
or about 64 years. 

3.  What are  the units for energy release rate?  Explain  thoroughly, yet concisely, what  is meant 
by “rate”  in  this context?  Explain how  this  relates  to  the material property of  toughness.  In 
general,  rank  the classes of materials  (metallic,  ceramic,  and polymeric)  from  the highest  to 
lowest energy release rate by using speciﬁc, cited examples from literature. 

Solution:  The  units  of  energy  release  rate  are  MPa  m  (or  more  generally,  energy  per  unit 
distance).  The  energy  release  rate  is  not  a  change  of  energy  with  respect  to  time,  but  is 
instead  the  rate  of  change  in  potential  energy  with  crack  area.  It  is  therefore  a  value  that 
represents the energy required to extend the crack.  If this energy is small, the potential energy 
to  increase  the  crack  length  is  small,  and  thus  the  toughness  of  the material  is  low.  Metals 
will have the highest energy release rate followed by polymers and then ceramics.

4.  Calculation of the stress as a function from distance from an elliptical through-thickness crack 
a ). 
tip  of width  2a  and  tip  radius R was  given  in  class  but  not  derived,  as  σ  =  σo (1 + 2  R
The  derivation  includes  solution  of  a  biharmonic  equation  of  elasticity,  the  wise  selection 
of  an  appropriate  Airy  stress  function  χ  that  maintains  continuity  and  strain  compatibility 
across the crack face, and complex variables; this is the same approach used to solve the self-
stress  around  an  edge  dislocation.  You  could  do  it,  but  it’s  typically  treated  in  an  advanced 
mechanical  behavior  class.  To  put  things  in  perspective,  this was  solved  in  1913  by  Inglis, 
when analytical elastic mechanics was the only game in town. 

(a)  The  solution  is  a  twist  on  the  so-called  Eshelby  inclusion  problem,  or  the  effects  of

stress due  to  a  spherical hole  (or particle) of  radius R  =  a  inside  a material deformed 
under unaxial stress σo .  It  is derived  in polar coordinates r  (distance from hole center) 
and  θ  (in-plane  angle  around  hole  center),  and  has  the  nice  result  of  being  bounded  at 
the  maximum  to  some  ﬁnite  stress.  Let’s  work  on  part  of  this  to  understand  why  the 
stress concentration  is bounded  to be  lower  than  inﬁnity  for a circular ﬂaw:  The stress 
distribution σij  given by this internal defect is:

Given  that  you  expect  the  stress  to  be  maximized  along  the  equator  of  the  hole  (i.e., 
orthogonal  to  the  loading axis), use  the above expressions  to ﬁnd  the magnitude of  the 
maximum stress component in terms of only the applied stress σ .  In other words, what 
is the numerical, maximum stress concentration factor due to this circular ﬂaw? Graph­
ing σij  may help illustrate this. 

σrθ  = 

Solution:  There  are  several  approximations  of  this  type,  based  on  the  assumed  dis­
placement ﬁeld u(r)  from which  the  strain  tensor  �ij  and  then  the  stress  tensor σij  are 
computed.  The  stress  intensity  factor  that magniﬁes  the applied  stress σo  can be  eval­
uated  at  R  =  r  =  a  (i.e.,  at  the  perimeter  of  the  hole)  and  θ  =  φ  =  0  (for  assumed 
coordinate axes centered at the hole center), such that σθθ  = 2σo  and σrr  = 0, for the 
case of biaxial tension applied to a thick material containing a through-thickness hole. 

For the uniaxial applied stress case above, σθθ  = 5σo  for R = r = a and θ = 0: 
1 
σθθ  =  σo (1 + 1){1 + (1 + 3) ∗ 1}
2
and  σrr  =  σrθ  = 0.  Other  estimates  of  the  maximum,  taken  as  the  derivative  with 
respect  to  r  or  θ  give  σθθ  = 3σo .  Both  approaches  for  uniaxial  and  biaxial  tension 
show  that  the  stress  at  a  blunted  crack  or  a  hole  is  not  inﬁnite,  but  only  a  couple  or  a 
few  times  the applied stress.  This  is why sharp cracks are much more deleterious  than 
blunted cracks, in terms of applied stress required to fracture a defected material. 

(b)  Now let us assume the crack is a through-thickness, sharp crack as Grifﬁth considered, 
and the material is amorphous silica for which others have reported γsurf  and E . What 
is the fracture stress σf  if this silica initially contained defects of length 2a = 1 mm? 

Solution:  The  Grifﬁth  solution  simply  balances  the  energetic  penalty  of  new  surface 
area to the energetic beneﬁt of relieved strain energy.  The values I found for γsurf  and 
E  of silica are 3.5  to 5.3 J/m2  [S.M. Wiederhorn.  J. Am.  Ceram.  Soc.  52:  99  (1969)] 
and 68 GPa (my own measurements, but also handbook values), respectively.  I assumed

a value of 4.25 J/m2  for surface tension, as this is the average of reported values.  With 
� 
these  values  and  initial  internal  crack  of  half-length  0.5  mm,  the  fracture  stress  σf  is 
computed as:

Note  that  surface  tension  is actually often computed by applying Grifﬁth’s criterion  to 
fracture experiments, rather than measuring γs  directly!

(c)  If your application required a fracture strength of 1 GPa and you could chemically mod­
ify  any  internal  ﬂaw  surfaces  in  the  above  silica  via  chemical  vapor  deposition,  what 
would the target surface tension be?  Is this reasonably achievable? 

Solution:  To  attain  a  100-fold  increase  in  fracture  stress,  we  can  compute  the  target 
γs  from the same equation: 

γs  = 

= 11, 550J/m2  = 12kJ/m2  = 12kN/m.

This  is  far  greater  than  the  surface  tensions  typically  measured  for  synthetic  materi­
als,  and  suggests  that  the  only way  to  achieve  such  high  fracture  strengths  in  silica  is 
to  make  the  material  ﬂaw-free  or  change  the  environment  from  ambient  air  in  a  way 
that  increases  the  effective  surface  tension  with  the  surrounding  ambient  ﬂuid.  Both 
approaches are attempted in practice.
