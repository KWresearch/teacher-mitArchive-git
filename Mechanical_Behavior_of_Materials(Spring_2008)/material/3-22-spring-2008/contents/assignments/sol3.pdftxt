Problem Set #3 
Due:  Friday, March 21 by 5:00 PM 

1.  Because metallic glasses have an amorphous atomic structure, many researchers believe they 
cannot “strain harden” like their crystalline counterparts (a topic we will cover in depth later). 
At present, you can understand  this  to mean  that  the stress required  to continue deformation 
of  the  material  to  strains  greater  than  the  yield  strain  �(σy )  increases  monotonically,  often 
modeled as a power-law of the form σ = K �n
p  where �p  is the plastic strain, n is the material 
strain  hardening  exponent,  and K  is  a material  constant  related  to σy .  In  other words,  after 
yielding  the  material  becomes  “harder  (i.e.  more  difﬁcult)  to  strain.”  Regardless  of  this 
assumption, you decide to have a UROP in your group conduct some experiments to consider 
whether strain hardening does occur in a particular metallic glass you have synthesized.  You 
have  the UROP  compress  a  cylindrical  sample  of  bulk metallic  glass  that  is  6 mm  long  and 
3  mm  in  diameter  to  failure.  After  the  tests,  the  UROP  excitedly  presents  the  data  to  you 
),  claiming  to have proven with  these data  that  strain 
(which  can be  found  in 
3-1.xls
hardening  in  metallic  glasses  is  possible!  As  she  hyperventilates  talking  about  the  Nature 
article she wants to write, you realize that she is wrong (most likely because she did not have 
the opportunity to yet take 3.22). 
(a)  Explain why she is wrong.  Do this by calculating and discussing the σ − � response(s) 
and the strain hardening exponent n for the material. Compare your results with what is 
expected of a material that does strain harden. 

Solution:  We  can  plot  these  data  as  engineering  and  true  stress  strain.  Engineering 
stress  σe  and  strain  �e  can  be  easily  calculated  from  the  given  data  using  the  initial 
cross-sectional area A  and length l  of the specimen such that

where d is the displacement.  The true stress σt  and strain �t  can then be calculated by 

σt  =  σe (1 + �e ) 
ln(1 + �e ). 
�t  = 

The ﬁgure below is the plot of the true and engineering stress-strain curves based on the 
given data. Notice that the plastic regions in each curve are different.  In the engineering 
stress-strain curve, the plastic region appears to have a positive slope suggesting some 
level  of  strain  hardening while  in  the  true  stress-strain  curve  that material  appears  to 
act as perfectly plastic (e.g.  no strain hardening). 

A  measure  of  the  strain  hardening  in  a  material  is  the  strain  hardening  exponent  n

given  the  equation  σ  =  K �p
n .  This  exponent  can  be  determined  by  plotting  the  log  of 
stress  against  the  log  of  strain  in  the  plastic  region.  The  slope  of  a  line  ﬁtted  to  these 
data  yields  n.  For  our  data,  the  graphs  and  ﬁts  are  shown  below.  We  ﬁnd  that  n  in 
the engineering stress-strain data is ∼ 0.09 and nominally zero in the true stress-strain 
data.  Therefore we conclude that the UROP must have analyzed the engineering stress-
strain  data  and  thought  she  observed  strain  hardening  in  the  material.  To  avoid  this 
error, the true stress-strain data should always be utilized when actual properties of the 
material are  calculated,  as  these measures of  stress and  strain more accurately  reﬂect 
the deformation state of the material (not just what is easiest to measure) 

(b)  Determine the elastic and plastic strain at failure. 

Solution:  The  results  of  this  problem  depends  on  whether  you  used  the  true  or  engi­
neering stress-strain data.  The method  is  the same  for each, but since we  just  lectured 
about the importance of using true stress-strain, we will stick with that. 

The  total  strain  �tot  is  the  sum  of  the  elastic  strain  �el  and  �p .  From  our  data,  we

region  up  to  the  yielding  point,  which  in  our  data  occurs  at  �el  � −0.3.  Therefore 
�p  = (−0.19) − (−0.03) = −0.16. 

(c)  Not  one  to  give  up  easily,  you  think  that  you may  be  able  to  get  the metallic  glass  to 
strain harden by applying a cyclic load (with the minimum load being 0 N) through the 
plastic region. Show what the resulting stress-strain curve would look like if you applied 
three cycles before failure. 

Solution:  When  a  material  is  loaded  into  the  plastic  region  (but  before  failure)  and 
then the load is released, the material will recover all the elastic strain (in most cases). 
The  plastic  strain  however  is  permanent  deformation  and  therefore  the  strain  at  zero 
applied stress will be equal to the plastic strain.  If the material is then loaded again, it 
will initially strain elastically (following σ/E ) until the yield stress is reached and then 
the strain will be plastic.  See the ﬁgure below.

The von Mises criterion is given by

(σI  − σII )2  + (σII  − σIII )2  + (σIII  − σI )2

which  yields  σ  =  866 MPa.  Since  σ  < σy  =  950 MPa,  the material will  not  yield

according to the Von Misses criterion. 

σ  =
◦ 

The Tresca criterion is 

σ  = σI  − σIII 
◦ 
and yields σ  =  1000 MPa, which is larger than σy .  Therefore according to the Tresca 
◦
criterion, the material would fail. Note that we get two different answers. 

(b)  Plot the yield surfaces (on the same graph) of the material based on the von Mises and 
Tresca criteria. 

Soution:  See the ﬁgure below.  For simplicity, only a slice of the yield surface is shown. 
Accurate representation of each surface in three dimensional can be found under “Yield 
Surfaces” on Wikipedia and MechE-geared textbooks on continuum plasticity.  In order 
to  draw  the  entire  surface,  we must  assume  that  the material  is  isotropic  (an  inherent 
assumption  in  von  Mises  and  Tresca),  and  thus  the  yield  stress  of  the  material  is  the 
same in tension and compression. 

(c)  You decide to examine the material more closely by performing your own uniaxial ten­
. 
sion and compression tests. The stress-strain data for these tests are found in 
3-2.xls
Plot  these data on  the same graph as you made  in  (b).  Discuss how  the von Mises and 
Tresca criteria predict yielding  in  the material.  Is  there a better criterion  to use for  this 
material? Explain. 

Solution:  The  yield  stress  in  tension  and  compression  can  be  determined  from  a  line 
drawn  with  a  strain  offset  of  0.002  and  slope  equal  to  the  Young’s  Modulus  (see  ﬁg­
ure  below).  Where  this  line  intersects  the  strain-stress  curve  is  the  the  yield  stress.

σy,C  = 2 GPa.  These points are plotted on the graph in the solutions to part (b). 
We see that both the von Mises and Tresca criteria do not accurately predict the asym­

metry in the yielding stress observed in the tests. A yield criterion that accounts for this 
asymmetry should be used.  Examples  include  the Mohr-Coulumb and Drucker-Prager 
criteria that are discussed in more detail in the following problems. 

The  data  used  in  this  problem were  taken  from  a  paper  by  A.C.  Lund  and C.A.  Schuh 
(Acta Mat.  51,  2399  (2003)) where  they  simulated  yielding  in metallic  glass  to  exam­
ine the yield surface.  In their analysis,  they choose to use the Mohr-Coulumb criterion 
because they were only interested in the non-shear terms that contributed to yielding. 

3.  Noting  that  the  von  Mises  and  Tresca  criteria  deviate  for  speciﬁc  stress  states  in  the  yield 
surface considered above, determine the following: 

(a)  The stress tensor σij  corresponding to the stress state(s) at which there is maximal dif­
ference between  these  two yield  criteria,  expressed  as  a matrix  and  as  a  representative 
volume  element  (RVE)  of  the material.  This will  correspond  to  the  biggest  gap(s)  be­
tween these two predictions in the graphical yield surface. 
Solution:  The  maximum  difference  between  the  von  Mises  and  Tresca  surfaces  occur 
when σ1  =  −σ2  or σ2  =  −σ1  (see  the ﬁgure below).  From Mohr’s circle,  this state  is 
������� 
�������

equivalent to one of pure shear or 
(b)  The magnitude of this difference, expressed ﬁrst in terms of an algebraic expression in­
cluding the σy  of the material and second in terms of a percentage basis [%].

(c)	 Which  of  these  two  criteria more  accurately  predicts  the  stress  states  corresponding  to 
material  yielding  in  pure metals  and metallic  alloys,  and  why  does  this  tend  to  be  the 
more accurate predictor? To answer this, you will need to rely on and show/cite experi­
mental data for selected materials. 

Solution: Considering several published yield surfaces, it is clear that von Mises better 
predicts yield  in ductile metals  that  fail via  shear.  This  is because all  three  stress axes 
play a role in deforming the lattice and contributing to the magnitude of shear stresses 
on slip planes. 

4.  The yield strength σy  of many materials  is poorly described by von Mises and Tresca;  these 
include porous materials, glassy polymers, granular media, and biological materials. For such 
materials, σy  depends  in part on  the state of hydrostatic stress σii  and  thus  the ﬁrst  invariant 
of σij , I1 . Here, you will explore some of these pressure-sensitive yield criteria. 

(a)  Mohr  and  Coulomb  discussed  continuum mechanics  and  particle  interactions,  respec­
tively.  Their  ideas  enabled modiﬁcation  of  the  yield  criteria  to  reﬂect  the  fact  that  σy 
may  differ  in  uniaxial  tension  vs.  compression.  This  criterion  is  commonly  used  for 
bulk metallic glass and soils, which fail at lower applied stresses in tension than in com­
pression.  It  linearly  relates  the  effect  of  superposed  normal  and  shear  stresses  on  the 
stress state  required  to yield  the material, and Mohr’s circle helps us easily understand 
this.  Assume an  imposed principal stress state  in a material plane; Mohr-Coulomb ex­
presses  the  yield  criteria  in  terms  of  the  stress  state  at  maximal  shear  stress  resulting 
from σ1  and σ3 , and can be expressed as the material yielding when: 

τ  =< σ > sin  α	

(1) 

where < σ > is the average normal stress corresponding to τ , and (τ , < σ >) is the co­
ordinate on Mohr’s circle deﬁned at the point of max shear stress for deﬁned σ1  > 0 and

if you poured the granular material onto a surface due to friction between the particles, 
and  is usually between 15o  and 50o .  In  terms of Mohr’s circle,  it  is  the angle between 
the vertical line connecting (τ , < σ  >) to the τ  = 0 horizontal axis, and the tangent of 
the circle that intersects the point (τ  = 0, σ  =  0).  Draw this Mohr’s circle, and restate 
the Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion only  in  terms of  these normal principal  stresses and 
the material friction angle. 

Solution:  See  the  ﬁgure  below  for  the  Mohr’s  circle.  Note  that,  more  generally,  the 
tangent  to  this  circle  need  not  intersect  (σ  = 0,  τ  = 0);  it  needs  only  cross  the  line 
deﬁned as σ = 0, and then the y-intercept deﬁnes a ﬁnite k, the value of τ  deﬁned as the 
cohesion strength of the material.  The Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion is thus restated as 
(σI− < σ >)2  + (σIII− < σ >)2  = 2 < σ >2  sin2 α 

(b)  Drucker and Prager developed the creatively named Drucker-Prager yield criterion orig­
inally  for soil mechanics and  it  is often applied  to composite materials such as cement 
� 
or concrete.  It accounts for normal and shear stresses, and can be stated as: 
f  =  J2  − αI1  − k 
where J2  is the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor sij  and α and k are mate­
rial properties that reﬂect the friction angle and cohesion, respectively. When f  reaches 
a critical value corresponding to yielding under a uniaxial stress state, the material will 
yield.  Express  f  in  terms  of  the  stresses  σij  that  deﬁne  I1  and  J2 ,  and  determine  the 
value of f (α, k) that corresponds to yielding under an applied uniaxial stress state.

(c)  Mohr-Coulomb  and Drucker-Prager  are  similar  in  relation  to  each  other  as Tresca  and 
von  Mises.  Both  account  for  superposed  normal  and  shear  stresses,  but  one  is  more 
conservative  than  the  other.  Graphically  represent  the M-C  and D-P  yield  locii  on  the 
same σ1/σy  vs.  σ2/σy  graph, and state why one  is more conservative  than  the other  in 
predicting yielding of pressure-sensitive materials. 

Solution:  See below for the Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager yield “surfaces”.  Be­

cause  Drucker-Prager  consider  σI , σI I ,  and  σI I I  (similar  to  von  Mises)  and  Mohr-

Coulomb considers only σI  and σI I I  (similar  to Tresca), Drucker-Prager  is more con­

servative in predicting yielding of pressure sensitive materials.


5.  Material stiffness and strength are very different properties attributed to very different atom­
istic  mechanisms.  In  60  words  or  less  (think  elevator  conversation),  clearly  and  accurately 
state the difference between these two concepts in a way that should be perfectly clear to any 
engineer, physicist, or chemist. 

Solution:  Stiffness  is  resistance  to  reversible  bond  stretching,  and  reﬂects  macroscopic  re­
sistance  to  elastic  deformation.  Strength  is  resistance  to  irreversible  bond  rearrangement 
and defect motion, and reﬂects macroscopic resistance to plastic deformation.

shear  strength  of  a  crystal,  and  that  the  motion  of  each  dislocation  contributes  unit  slip  of 
magnitude |b|. 
(a)  Express the plastic shear strain γ p  that would result from a single edge dislocation glid­
ing  along  its  slip  plane  all  the  way  to  the  free  surface.  Here,  consider  a  rectangular 
single crystal block of height h, width across the page w and depth into the page L; ﬁrst 
express γ p (b, h) and then express γ p (A, V ) where A is the glide plane area and V  is the 
volume of the block. 

Solution:  If edge moves entirely thru the crystal on its slip plane then

γ p  = =

(b)  Now  consider  a  single  edge  dislocation  in  the  center  of  the  perfect  rectangular-prism 
box, gliding by an  incremental slip  inside  the block dx.  Express  the  incremental shear 
strain dγ p  in terms of b, L, dx and V . 

Solution:  If the dislocation only moves incrementally by dx then 

dγ p  =

(c)  Now  consider  the  case  of  n  dislocations,  and  express  this  incremental  shear  strain  in 
terms of  dislocation density ρ  (which  is  always deﬁned  as  total dislocation  line  length

Dislocation density ρ is equal to the line length over volume (nL/V ).  Therefore,

(d)  Finally,  express  the  time  derivative  of  dγ p  in  terms  of  the  time  derivative  of  displace­
ment  dx/dt.  You  will  have  derived  the  Orowan  equation,  which  predicts  the  plastic 
shear strain rate possible in a material of known dislocation density, Burgers vector, and 
dislocation velocity v.

(e)  Assume  dislocation  velocity  is  equivalent  to  the  speed  of  sound  in  Cu,  and  determine 
the plastic shear strain rate magnitude for annealed, single crystal Cu. 
Solution:  Let  sound  velocity =  2300 m  s−1  in  Cu  [Kumar  et  al.;  Acta Mat  51:  2417 
(2003)]  and  dislocation  density  =  1013  m−2  (annealed)  and  Burgers  vector  = 3 ×
10−10  m  (these  could  all  be  determined more  precisely  and/or  values  cited  from  liter­
ature).  For  these  values,  plasticity  shear  rate  due  to  dislocation  glide  is  the  product, 
7 × 106  m s−1 , or 7 × 108  cm s−1 . Note that this solution assumes that all the disloca­
tions are equally mobile at  the  same  time, and  that  the dislocations are  in  fact moving 
at  the  shear wave velocity  inside  the material.  In actuality,  only a  fraction of  the  total 
dislocations may be under sufﬁcient stress to move, and the velocity of these dislocations 
will be  less  than  the shear wave  (phonon) velocity;  a  typical experimental observation 
in annealed fcc metals is 101  cm s−1 .
