1.  The beauty of a bicycle wheel design is that the spokes (narrow cylindrical wires connecting 
the wheel center to the perimeter) are loaded in tension, despite the compressive force exerted 
via the bicyclist’s weight.  Consider a stainless steel spoke with a diameter of 2 mm, under a 
1000 N (224 lbf) load. 

(a)  What is the (tensile) stress on the spoke? 

Solution: Using linear continuum, the tensile stress σ  is then simply 

σ  = 

Forces 
Area 
1000 N 
= 
π0.0012  m 
=  318 MPa 

(b)  What  is  the  elastic  strain  in  the  spoke,  given  that  approximation  of  the  stainless  steel 
as  a  linear  elastic  continuum  is  a  reasonable  approximation?  If  the  spoke  is  initially 
25.50 cm long, what is the spoke length under the maximum applied load? 

Solution:  Again,  using  linear  elastic  continuum  we  can  calculate  the  strain  �  using 
Hooke’s Law and Young’s Modulus E . For a stainless steel E  = 195 GPa and thus 

�  = 

σ 
E 
0.318 GPa 
= 
195 GPa 
= 0.0016 

We can then calculate the length of the spoke under the maximum applied load by using 
our engineering deﬁnition of strain: 

�  = 

δ l 
◦ − 25.5 
l 
lf 
0.0016  = 
25.5 
lf  =  25.54 cm 

(c)  Why  would  it  be  a  bad  idea  to  place  the  spoke  under  a  compressive  load  of  1000  N? 
Explain this quantitatively, using the elastica.

Solution:  If  the  maximum  force  F  is  applied  in  compression,  the  spoke  will  buckle. 
To show this using the elastica, we look at the critical load Pc  for buckling, 
π2E I 
l2 
where l  is the length of the spoke, E  is the Young’s Modulus of stainless steel, and I  is 
the moment of inertia for a circular cross section given by 

Pc  = 

I  = 

πr4 
4 
Substituting  I  into  Pc  we  ﬁnd  Pc  =  23  N  which  is  far  less  than  F .  The  spoke  will 
certainly buckle if it is compressively loaded to 1000 N. 
(d)  The company that employs you, Unique Unicycles, has designed a new bicycle that re­
quires the spokes be loaded in compression.  Design an alternative circular spoke made 
of  stainless  steel  that  is  able  to  carry  the  same  load  and  yet  is  a  reasonable  size  and 
weight for the bicycle (e.g., within 25% of the initial spoke weight). 

Solution:  Upon  examining  the  equation  for  buckling,  we  see  that  there  are  two  ways 
of increasing Pc : By decreasing l or increasing I  (by increasing the radius of the spoke 
r).  Since  we  assume  l  is  ﬁxed  (nobody  wants  small,  stubby  wheels),  we  will  have  to 
increase r. 

To carry F  = 1000 N in compression, r would have to be 

4F l2 
r 4  = 
π3E 
r  =  2.6 mm 

according to the buckling formula.  This increases our radius by 250%.  By mass m, the 
change is larger

or 555% increase!!! 

Is  there a more efﬁcient way?  What about a hollow  tube?  The moment of  inertia  for a 
tubular cross section It  is 

It  = πr3 t ◦ 
where r  and t  is  the outer radius of  the  tube and  the wall  thickness respectively.  Sub­

stituting this into our buckling equation we ﬁnd 

3 r t =

From this we ﬁnd that the lowest possible mass increase is 37% when r  = 3.9 mm and 
◦ 
t = 0.18 mm.  This thickness however may be too thin to prevent other forms of failure 
like local buckling. A more reasonable minimum thickness would be 0.5 mm. Using this 
as t, we ﬁnd r  = 2.8 mm which results in a weight increase of 153%.

2.  Spokes  are  typically  made  by  drawing  a  billet  of  stainless  steel  through  a  die  to  reduce  its 
diameter.  During this type of processing it is common for a preferred crystallographic orien­
tation to develop (e.g.  a texture), which is a speciﬁc microstructural term meaning alignment 
of  the  unit  cells’  orientation.  Assume  that  the  two  most  common  orientations  to  form  are 
<111> and <100>, aligned parallel to the long axis of the spoke (i.e., either the (111) or the 
(100) is aligned normal to the spoke long axis. 

(a)  Suppose  for  a  bicycle  wheel,  it  is  desirable  to  maximize  the  stiffness  of  the  spokes. 
Which crystallographic orientation  is preferable?  (For simplicity, use material data for 
Fe, the major element in stainless steel). 
�

Solution:  Young’s Modulus E  of a speciﬁc crystallographic plane can be given by

= S11  − 2 (S11  − S12 ) − 
2 S44  α2β 2  + α2γ 2  + β 2γ 2 
Ehkl 
where  Sij  are  components  of  the  compliance  tensor  and  α,  β ,  and  γ  are  the  direction 
cosines of the [hkl] direction and the [100], [010], and [001] directions, respectively. 

We can ﬁnd S11 , S12 , and S44  for several elements in Courtney.  For Fe and Mo (which 
we examine in part (b))

0.86 × 10−11 
0.91 × 10−11 
S44 (Pa−1 ) 
The  direction  cosines  for  the  (111)  and  (100)  planes  are  α  =  β  =  γ  = 0.577  and 
α = 1, β  = γ  = 0, respectively. For Fe, these values give us 
E111  =  276 GPa 
E100  =  129 GPa 

Since  we  want  the  stiffer  direction,  we  would  want  the  (111)  family  of  atomic  planes 
aligned normal to the loading direction. 
(b)  Is  your  answer  to  part  (a)  the  same  if  you  were  to  manufacture  the  spokes  from Mo? 
Why or why not? 

Solution: We do a similar analysis for Mo.  Because Mo is cubic (BCC), the directional 
cosines are the same as Fe (FCC). Thus 
E111  =  291 GPa 
E100  =  357 GPa

In  this  case,  the  stiffer  planes  are  the  (100)  family  of  planes.  The  reason  for  the  dif­
ference is because of the electron structure of these two materials.  You will learn more 
about this in later lectures. 
(c)  In a unit cell of Fe, if the stress calculated in question 1(a) is applied in a direction nor­
mal  to  the  (111)  plane,  what  are  the  components  of  the  stress  on  the  {100}  family  of 
planes? 

Solution:  This  is  a  simple  matrix  transformation  problem.  Stress  on  the  new  axis  σij 
is given by 

σij  = aikajlσkl 
where aik  and ajl  are direction cosines  for matrix  transformations and σkl  is  the stress 
along  the old axis.  First we deﬁne our old axis as normal  to  the (111) plane  (which  in 
a cubic material such as Fe is the [111] direction) and our new axis as along the [100] 
direction.  The  stress  is  applied  along  the  (111)  direction  and we will  deﬁne  it  as  σ11 . 
The new stress is then given by 

σ1� 1�  = a1� 1a1� 1σ11 

because all the other σij  are equal to zero.  The direction cosine α1� 1  is the cosine of the 
angle between our old direction (111) and our new direction (100).  In a cubic materials, 
the angle between  two atomic planes φ with  indices  (h1 , k1 , l1 ) and  (h2 , k2 , l2 )  can be 
calculated by 
�

This angle is also the angle between the [111] and [100] directions because Fe is cubic. 
Therefore the stress along the (100) direction σ1� 1�  is

(d)  To calculate the strain along these <100> directions, what other information would you 
need? 

Solution:  To  calculate  the  strain  �  along  the  <  100  >  directions  we  would  need  the 
compliance tensor Sij  since 

�i  = Sijσj 

3.  X-ray  diffraction  is  a  technique  commonly  used  to  measure  microscopic  elastic  strains  in 
crystalline metals. These elastic strains alter the atomic plane spacing which can be measured 
by  Bragg’s  Law.  Recently  Poulsen  and  coworkers  [Poulsen  et  al.,  Nature  Materials  4,  33 

3.22 Mechanical Behavior of Materials 

4 

K.J. Van Vliet 

(2005)]  have  shown  that  elastic  strains  in  amorphous materials  can  also  be measured  using 
similar methods.  However,  these materials do not have atomic planes,  so  instead  strains are 
measured  by  the  pair  correlation  function,  which  is  a  measure  of  nearest-neighbor  atomic 
spacings. 

(a)  Derive  a  strain  equation  for  this  technique,  analogous  to  the macroscopic deﬁnition of 
engineering strain. 

� = 

� = 

Solution:  The macroscopic deﬁnition of strain � is 
lσ  − l 
◦ 
l ◦ 
where  lσ  is  the  length  of  the  object  under  a  stress  σ  and  l  is  the  length  under  zero 
◦
stress.  In  the  case of  crystalline metals,  the “length” we are measuring with  x-rays  is 
the atomic plane spacing d and the microscopic strain becomes 
dσ  − d 
◦ 
d ◦ 
where, analogous to our macroscopic deﬁnition, dσ  and d  are the atomic spacing under 
◦
stress σ and zero stress, respectively.  Although metallic glasses have no atomic planes, 
it has been recently shown by Poulsen and coworkers [Poulsen et al., Nature Materials 
4,  33  (2005)]  and  conﬁrmed  by Hufnagel  and  coworkers  [Hufnagel  et  al.,  Phys.  Rev. 
B73,  064204  (2006)]  that  strains  in  these  materials  can  be  measured  and  calculated 
using  the  same  equation  where  d  is  redeﬁned  as  the  nearest  neighbor  spacing.  For  a 
more  detailed  description  of  this,  the  reader  is  directed  to  the  paper  by Hufnagel  and 
coworkers. 
(b)  Suppose  you  load  a  cylindrical  piece  of  Zr-based  metallic  glass  3  mm  in  diameter  in 
compression up to a load P  = 7500 N, stopping at speciﬁc ﬁxed loads to record diffrac­
tion  data.  The  incident  beam  is  monochromatic  (E  =  80  keV)  and  the  scattering  is 
conducted in a transmission geometry with a two-dimensional detector placed 400 mm 
downstream  from  your  sample  (Fig.  1A).  Figure  1B  is  an  example  of  the  diffraction 
patterns you collect.  The broad halo is indicative of scattering from an amorphous ma­
terial.  Because  you  used  high-energy  x-rays  and  a  two-dimensional  detector,  you  are 
able  to  differentiate  the  strain  along  (�)  and  normal  (⊥)  to  the  direction  of  loading  by 
measuring  the  radius of  the halo along  these  two directions  (Fig. 1C). Table 1  lists  the 
peak radii along these directions as a function of load.  Graph the strain as a function of 
applied stress along these two directions. How could you extend this test to conﬁrm that 
the deformation was purely elastic? 

Solution:  The  broad  halo  is  a  scattering  maximum  generated  by  coherent  scattering 
from  the  short  range  order  (e.g.  ﬁrst  nearest  neighbors)  in  the metallic  glass.  This  is 
analogous  to  the sharp peaks produced by scattering  from atomic planes  in crystalline 
metals.  Coherent  scattering  is  only  possible  when  Bragg’s  Law  is  satisﬁed.  Solving 
Bragg’s Law for d, gives 

d = 

λ 
2 sin Θ

of the two-dimensional diffraction pattern collected [Poulsen et al., Nature Materials 4, 33 (2005)]. 
The broad halo  is  indicative of  scattering  from  an  amorphous material.  Taking  a one-dimensional 
slice  from  the center of  the pattern out  to  the edge yields a plot of  intensity as a  function of  radial 
distance  as  shown  in  (C)  [Poulsen  et  al., Nature Materials  4,  33  (2005)].  The  position  of  the  ﬁrst 
peak is related to the nearest neighbor distances. 

where λ is the wavelength of the x-ray photons given by λ = hc/E with h being Planck’s 
constant, c the speed of light, and E  the energy of the photons, and Θ is half the Bragg 
angle.  Using basic geometry we ﬁnd  that 2Θ  =  arctan(R/L) where R and L are  the 
radius  of  diffraction  halo  and  the  sample-to-detector  length,  respectively.  Given  the 
information in Table 1 and the above equations, we can now calculate the strain along 
and normal to the direction of loading.  The engineering stress σ  is given by the applied 
load P  divided by the cross-sectional area of the sample.  The resulting plot should look 
similar to Fig. 2.  If the deformation is all elastic, then performing the same experiment 
as you unload and reload the sample will yield nominally identical results. 

(c)  Compare  the  true vs.  engineering strain and  the  true vs.  engineering stress at  the state 
of maximum applied load. 

Solution:  The  true  stress  σtrue  is  less  than  the  engineering  stress  σeng  because  after 
application of the maximum load, the cross sectional area is larger than the initial cross 
sectional  area.  The  engineering  stress  is  simply  the  load P  divided  by  the  initial  area 
A; σeng = −1061 MPa. To calculate the true stress at maximum applied load, we must 
ﬁnd the cross-sectional area at this point. From our answer in part (b), we see the strain 
�  in  the  direction  normal  to  the  applied  load  is  0.004  at  the  maximum  applied  load. 
The new diameter D  is therefore equal to �D  + D  where D  is the original diameter 
◦
◦ 
◦
(3 mm). From these we ﬁnd σtrue  = 1053 MPa.

continuum. 

Solution: The graph in part (b) is just an inverted stress-strain curve of elastic deforma­
tion.  If we plot  the data as stress against strain,  the slope will be equal  to  the Young’s 
Modulus E .  This  is  valid  because  the metallic  glass  is  isotropic.  Poisson’s  ratio  ν  is 
then  calculated  from  the  deﬁnition  of  the  Poisson  effect,  ��  =  −ν �⊥ .  The  calculated 
values should be nominally E  = 84 GPa and ν  = 0.35. 
(e)  What are the strains along the principle stress axes σi  during the peak compressive load? 
How  would  you  construct  a  complete  strain  tensor  using  x-ray  diffraction?  Write  out 
the full small-strain tensor �ij  under uniaxial loading using as few variables as possible. 

Solution:  Because  the metallic  glass  is  isotropic,  we  can  take  our  principle  directions 
as the loading direction and two directions normal to this. We’ve calculated the strains 
at different loads along the loading direction (�1 ) and one direction normal to this (�2 ) 
(Fig.  3A).  These  are  given  in  the  answer  to  part  (b).  By  deﬁning  these  two  principle 
directions,  the  third  direction  must  be  along  that  of  the  incident  beam.  The  transmis­
sion geometry used however does not give us any  information about  strains along  this 
direction.  To explicitly obtain strain in this direction (�3 ),  the sample would have to be 
rotated 90◦  around the loading axis (Fig. 3B). Doing this would conﬁrm what we could 
have assumed due to the isotropic nature of the glass; that �2  =  �3 .  (Note that rotating 
the  sample  such  that  the  loading  axis  is  along  the  direction  of  the  incident  beam,  as 
in Fig. 3C,  is also an acceptable  solution,  although more  challenging  experimentally.) 
Because we have deﬁned  the  strains along  the principal directions,  there are no  shear 
������� 
������� 
strains, so our strain tensor written in as few variables as possible is 
(f)  What would  the  resulting  diffraction  pattern  look  like  if  you  applied  a  shear  stress  τ ? 
a  hydrostatic  compressive  stress  σii ?  (Please  show  this  by  drawing  a  schematic XRD 
pattern, and comparing it to the given, unstressed state.)

Solution: In the unstressed state, the amorphous diffraction ring appears a circle (Fig. 4). 
Under  the  uniaxial  compressive  stress  in  part  (b),  the  ring will  be  a  oval  elongated  in 
a  direction  normal  to  loading  direction.  Under  a  shear  stress,  the  diffraction  pattern 
will  also  be  an  oval with  the  elongated  axis  45  from  the  loading  axis.  If  a  hydrostatic 
compressive  stress  is  applied,  the  pattern  will  again  be  a  circle  because  the  metallic 
glass is isotropic.  The radius however will be larger than that from the unstressed state.

5.  We  know  that  elastic  constants  are  expressed  as  4th  rank  tensors,  but  can  be  reduced  to  a 
matrix  of  only  36  components.  A  cubic  crystal  (simple  cubic,  body  centered  cubic,  or  face 
centered cubic) has three independent elastic constants, for example given as the stiffness ma­
trix elements C11 , C12 , and C44 . An isotropic continuum, which is what we’ve approximated 
the stainless steel and amorphous metal to be in the above problems, has only two independent

elastic constants, for example given as E and ν . By exerting stresses and symmetry operations 
on such a cubic crystal, prove how 3  independent elastic constants can be  reduced  to only 2 
if the material is elastically isotropic. 
Solution:  Let  us  consider  a  state  of  equibiaxial  strain  (�xx  =  �yy  =  −�).  We  know  from 
Mohr’s  circle  that  this  is  exactly  equivalent  to  a  state  of  pure  shear  strain  (�xy  =  �)  at  an 
angle 45 degrees rotated in plane. 

The  shear  strain  in  the  new  axis  set  (45  degree  rotation)  can  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the 
old axis set (original equibiaxial strain) as: 
�x� y�  = ax� xay� x �xx  + ax� y ay� y �yy 
� 
�
√
√
2)(−1/  2))(−�) + (1/
�x� y�  = (1/
2)(1/  2))(�) = � 

which is: 

τxy  = 

In the same way, the shear stress in the new axis set is: 
−
1 
1 
σxx  + 
σyy 
2
2
Since we know that for a cubic material, Hooke’s law relates the normal stresses in the orig­
inal axis set to the Cij  matrix: 
σxx  = C11 �xx  + C12 �yy  = −�(C11  − C12 ) 
and in the same way, σyy  = −�(C12  − C11 ). 

Finally,  we  can  express  the  isotropic  elastic  constant  G  in  terms  of  the  new  axis  set  or  the 
original axis set.  In the new axis set, 

G = τx� y� /γx� y�  = τx� y� /2�x� y�  = C44 

and if we replace �x� y�  with our above expression in terms of � in the original axis set, we ﬁnd: 
1 
�(C11  − C12 ) 
G = 
2�
Thus, C44  =  C11  − C12  for a material that is isotropic, one fewer elastic constants than for 
a cubic material.
