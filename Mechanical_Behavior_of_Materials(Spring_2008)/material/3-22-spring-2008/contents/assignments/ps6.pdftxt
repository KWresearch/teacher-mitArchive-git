Problem Set 
#6 
Due:  Friday, May 9 by 5:00 PM 

1.  Describe  thoroughly  yet  concisely  three  (general)  toughening mechanisms  in materials.  Be 
sure to include an example of each, and not to confuse (yield) strengthening with toughening. 
For one mechanism, show a fractograph and brieﬂy note features  in  the fracture surface  that 
illustrate how the mechanism works. 

2.  Lowhaphandu and Lewandowski [Scripta Mater.  38, 1811(1998)] studied the effect of crack 
tip  radius  on  the  stress  intensity  factor  at  failure  for  a  speciﬁc  material,  as  summarized  in 
the graph below.  (Note that they call crack tip radius “notch root radius” and stress intensity 
factor at failure “fracture toughness”.) 

(a)  Using Inglis’ analysis of stress at the tip of an elliptical hole, calculate the stress at the 
crack  tip  (as  a  function  of  applied  stress)  for  the  largest  and  smallest  crack  tip  radius 
considered.  (This is an single edge-crack with initial crack length a of 25 mm.) 
(b)  Are your  results  from part  (a)  consistent with  the  results  in  the graph below  (i.e.,  con­
sistent with the fact that at the largest crack tip radius we measure has the largest stress 
intensity factor)? Explain why they are or are not consistent.

3.  For a single material (which follows Paris Law steady-state crack propagation with m = 2
), 
you  have  tested  three  components  with  initial  crack  sizes  a  which  failed  with  ﬁnal  crack 
◦
sizes af  (listed in the table below). 
(a)  Assume the fatigue conditions of all components are uniaxial loading with R = −1 at a 
maximum stress of 100 MPa and a frequency f  of 10 Hz.  Draw σ(t) for two complete 
loading cycles, and also draw the representative volume elements and associated stress 
states at the minimum and maximum σ(t). 
(b)  Compare  the  differences  in  fatigue  lifetimes  for  the  three  components.  Explain  your 
ﬁndings in terms of crack growth rates.  From this, what do you infer about how growth 
of cracks should be monitored in a material component put into application?

(c)  Comment on  the average  stress applied  to  this material,  and why  this  is not counter  to 
the reality that fatigue failure still occurs in all of these components. 

4.  With your special  topic group, please prepare slides for a short presentation of your  topic  to 
the  class,  to  be  delivered  on  Tuesday,  May  13.  A  template  will  be  posted  for  your  conve­
nience on the wiki.  Be as creative as you like, but please adhere to the guidelines to provide 
uniformity of details and keep to our time constraints. 
Reminder  that you will need  to  respond  to 2 of 3 wiki questions on  the  last quiz  (i.e., 2  that 
are  not  your  own  special  topic).  The  questions  will  be  based  on  content  delivered  in  these 
presentations  and  related  lecture/pset material  from  the  semester.  However,  you  will  likely 
ﬁnd it helpful and enjoyable to peruse the wiki pages of your colleagues to see more than they 
will have time to share in class.
