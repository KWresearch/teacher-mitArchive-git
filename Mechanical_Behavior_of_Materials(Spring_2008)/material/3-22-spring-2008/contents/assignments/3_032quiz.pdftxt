A soccer player was slide-tackled by an opponent, which unfortunately caused her tibia (large 
lower leg bone) to fracture. In this quiz, you will analyze the deformation and repair of this bone 
as an idealized case of forces applied to a simply-supported solid cylinder made of an isotropic, 
linearly elastic material in static equilibrium.

1. (a) Idealizing the supports as shown in the above figure, determine the location and 
magnitude of the maximum bending moment. Full shear force and bending moment diagrams 
V(x) and M(x) are not required, but are likely helpful. 

(b) Determine the magnitude of maximum tensile stress on the bone at this location of 
maximum bending moment, which is her tibia’s flexural strength.

2.  To repair the bone fracture, her leg will be placed under compressive force in the simple pin-
jointed traction device shown below, by applying a vertical force FB at pin B.

(a) Determine force in the member FAB in terms of any required reaction forces and 
moments at A and C and the angle θ, and indicate whether the applied force at B, FB, should 
be in the +y or –y direction, as indicated in the x-y axes of the figure, in order to maintain this 
bone in compression within this device. 

(b) The normal stress required to heal bone fracture in static compression is 15 MPa. Determine 
the magnitude of the axial force in the bone, member AC, that must be applied to achieve 
this stress if the fracture is oriented as shown:

(c) The critical buckling load of the members AB and BC is 10 kN. Does this limit the amount 
of compressive force that this device can apply to the bone, which is member AC? Discuss 
fully but concisely.

3. To reduce swelling of the leg while in the traction device, a hydraulic pressure sleeve (like a 
blood pressure armband) is applied. This exerts compressive pressure of 10 MPa normal to the 
bone cylindrical surface:

(a) For the above tibia, express the full tensor representation of the stress state σij of a 
representative volume element (tiny cube) of the bone, according to the axes orientation 
indicated in the figure. 

(b) Determine the magnitude of the normal strain component εyy under this multiaxial stress 
state for this isotropic linear elastic continuum. 

(c) X-rays show that the fracture line in the bone is inclined 30o counterclockwise from the bone 
cross-section over which the force FAC acts, as shown. Consider just the x-y plane, and determine 
the normal stress on this crack face resulting from the above σij.

1(b). Using concepts covered in 3.032, list at least three (3) key features of the tibia structure 
and material that we neglected when we chose to model this problem as a simply-supported 
solid cylinder made of an isotropic, linearly elastic material.

1. Wiki modifications 

(a) Correct this entry: 

“Precipitation Hardening 

Main article: Precipitation strengthening 

In most binary systems, alloying above a concentration given by the phase diagram will cause the 
formation of a second phase. A second phase can also be created by mechanical or thermal treatments. 
The particles that compose the second phase precipitates act as pinning points in a similar manner to 
solutes, though the particles are not necessarily single atoms.” 

(b) This entry is true, but explain the atomistic origin of this increased strength in amorphous polymers: 

“Mixing polymers is another method of increasing strength, particularly with materials that show crazing 
preceding brittle fracture such as atactic polystyrene (APS). For example, by forming a 50/50 mixture of 
APS with polyphenylene oxide (PPO), this embrittling tendency can be almost completely supressed, 
substantially increasing the fracture strength [5].” 

(c) How can the following statement be true, when we know that a perfect single crystal has theoretical 
strength on the order of GPa? 

“As shown in Figure 1 and the equation above, work hardening has a half root dependency on the number 
of dislocations. The material exhibits high strength if there are either high levels of dislocations (greater 
than 1014 dislocations per m2) or no dislocations. A moderate number of dislocations (between 10-7 and 
10-9 dislocations per m2) typically results in low strength.”

2. Samuel Evans’ family attempted to cook a turkey in their oven on Thanksgiving Day 2007, but the heating 
element suspended at the bottom of the oven catastrophically failed. It shattered into several pieces when the 
element dropped to the oven floor, making it difficult to determine the cause of material failure. Here you will 
determine the most likely cause and mechanism of fracture in the heating element. Relevant properties of the 
materials are listed on the board. 

(a) Idealizing the heating element as a simply supported beam (Fig. 1a) that is loaded by the force due to gravity 
(i.e., distributed load due to its mass), determine the static shear force and bending moment at the cantilever support. 

Fig. 1a. Heating element of length L = 20 
cm and mass = 200 g/cm. 

(b) The heating element is comprised of three materials: a copper wire core, an oxide-based ceramic jacket, and a 
conductive steel jacket (Fig. 1b). Determine the magnitude and orientation of the maximum normal stress and the 
maximum shear stress due to thermal heating to a typical turkey-cooking temperature of 350oF (177oC or 450K) in 
the Cu core, idealizing Cu as a linear elastic, isotropic continuum. Assume the heating element is at room 
temperature when not in use. 

Fig. 1b. Heating element cross-section of diameter D = 5 mm. 

Center = Cu core; white jacket = oxide; outer rim = steel jacket. 


(c) Rank these three materials in terms of the maximum stress generated in each, due to heating the element, 
justifying your answer with calculations as needed. 

3


(d) Which of these materials is the stiffest, and why? Which of these materials is the strongest, and why? Which of 
these materials is the toughest, and why? Here, “why” means “what is the atomistic origin of this mechanical 
property?”. 

(e) If Fig. 1d represents the deformation mechanism map of the copper wire core, is creep a likely source of failure? 
Here, the stress on the Cu is due to the total weight of the element and the thermal stress due to heating.

similar microstructure and processing to Cu core 
of heating element.

(f) Based on your identification of the dominant deformation mechanism under static stress, and how would you 
propose to modify the Cu microstructure to decrease the rate of creep deformation in the core? 

(g) Identify the material best modeled by Griffith’s fracture law, and determine whether this combined stress due to 
mass and temperature was sufficient to fracture this material.

(h) In actuality, the heating element undergoes cyclic heating that of high amplitude and low frequency. Let’s 
assume the oven is used once a week to cook a large piece of meat or casserole.  Graph the cyclic stress σ(t) for 
each of the three materials on the same graph. Clearly identify values of σa, Δσ, and ν. 

(i) What is the stress at the outer surface of the steel jacket, and why is it that value? 

(j) Idealize the cyclic heating as sinusoidal with the stress amplitude identified in (h). Let us assume that the Cu 
core was visually inspected for surface cracks before the heating element was constructed, and that these thermal 
stresses are sufficient to propagate a pre-existing crack. Determine the expected lifetime of the Cu wire core due to 
this thermal fatigue, in units of weeks. 

(k) Sketch a representative fracture surface that you would expect to see if the Cu core of the heating element failed 
via fatigue.

(l) Explain why the Cu might fail via thermal fatigue even if the applied stresses due to weight and temperature 
were below the fracture stress of Cu measured under uniaxial tension. 

(m) Briefly describe one of the two concepts of designing materials and structures to extend fatigue failure lifetimes 
(one being more conservative than the other). According to this material design principle, describe how you would 
redesign the heating element materials and/or structure to increase Nf. 

(n) The failure surface of the heating element is available for you to view in class. Based on your observations and 
above calculations, justify your identification of the most likely failure mechanism of this heating element. Note 
that you may decide creep, fracture, or fatigue failure was not the cause, but must present a well-justified alternative 
mechanism.
