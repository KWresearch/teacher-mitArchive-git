Dislocation Pile-up in Ge (MPG) (Courtesy Francois Louchet. Used with
permission.) â In situ TEM was used to capture this movie of dislocation
pile-up in a semiconductor. Note the dislocation glide is much more restricted
in semiconductors, due to both the crystal structure and bonding peculiarities
of these materials, as compared to metals. As a result, bulk silicon and other
semiconductors are brittle and do not exhibit any significant plastic yielding
prior to fracture. In class, we noted that conclusive observations of this
pileup mechanism have not been documented in ductile metals that exhibit Hall-
Petch strengthening.
***** Q&amp;A *****
Beam Bending Moment (PDF) â One student asked why the cross-section used to
define the moment of inertia in beam bending is the one that is parallel to the
axis of loading. By definition, I = double integral of y, the distance from the
neutral axis of bending. By definition, neutral axis defines the plane in the
bent beam in which there are neither tensile nor compressive stresses. In a
beam of rectangular cross-section, this is the "middle" of the beam height.
Class_Forum â This page contains questions and answers on a variety of
topics, mostly about the problem sets. These discussions originally took place
in the course forum between students, the teaching assistant, and the
professor.
