Examining a material's response to nanoindentation can lend insight to the
microstructural and molecular determinants of its mechanical properties. (Image

***** Course Description *****
Here we will learn about the mechanical behavior of structures and materials,
from the continuum description of properties to the atomistic and molecular
mechanisms that confer those properties to all materials. We will cover elastic
and plastic deformation, creep, fracture and fatigue of materials including
crystalline and amorphous metals, semiconductors, ceramics, and (bio)polymers,
and will focus on the design and processing of materials from the atomic to the
macroscale to achieve desired mechanical behavior. We will cover special topics
in mechanical behavior for material systems of your choice, with reference to
current research and publications.
