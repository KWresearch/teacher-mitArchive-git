3.22 Mechanical Behavior of Materials

May 2008

Big Picture
• Phenonmenon: Failure of viral capsids
• Viral capsids = proteinaceous outer shell of viruses that enclose highly-
packed genetic material under high pressure
• Capsomers = subunits that make up the capsid

Capsomer

• Material Class: Proteinaceous biological materials
• Motivation:
• Understanding viral release of genetic materials
• Gene therapy
• Biomimetic nanocontainers for drug delivery
• Antiviral Vaccines

3.22 Mechanical Behavior of Materials

Microscopic mechanism
•Lennard-Jones Potential Model
• Explains the equilibrium structure of viral capsids.
• Force Balance: R<R(eq.): Repulsive force = Compressive stress
R>R(eq.): Attractive force = Tensile stress

•Asymmetric L-J potential explains the stress states seen in Figure b). 
•Compressive stress at R<R(eq.) decreases faster with R than the  tensile stress does 
at R>R(eq.)
•Mechanical probing of virus capsids
•Atomic force microscopy (AFM) used to strain the capsid
until yielding and then fracture occur. Toughness and 
yield stress can be calculated.

Prediction & Optimization
• Predictions:
• Equilibrium capsomer spacing (cid:198) Equilibrium capsid
radius, R
• Asymmetric LJ potential (cid:198) Easier (smaller required σ) to 
stretch than compress by a given ΔR
• Capsids more easily fail by bursting/rupture than 
by compression!
• LJ potential between capsomers (cid:198)
• Max tolerable force (+ accompanying radius) found 
from potential’s flex point
• 5-10% radius expansion before bursting
• With increasing thermal fluctuations at increasing T (cid:198)
• Capsids fail before flex point radius and stress at 
higher T

• Optimization:
• To enhance bursting (genetic material delivery):
• Increase T
• Adjust pH & salt concentrations of ambient 
environment to increase differential osmotic pressure
• i.e. decrease ambient pressure

Upon bursting, small crack develops 
which propagates catastrophically 
until it rips across capsid surface

As in intergranular fracture, the crack 
propagates most easily at the 
interface between adjacent 
capsomers
