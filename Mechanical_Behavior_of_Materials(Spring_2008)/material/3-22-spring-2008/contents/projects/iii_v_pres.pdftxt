Big Picture: III-V Devices
•Applications: high speed electronics, optical (GaAs: red; GaN: blue; green?)
•Mechanical properties:
•Substrate handling
•Avoid delamination
•Importance of defects:
•Point defects: electronic properties
•Line defects: 
•electronic properties
• mechanical properties
•Temperature effect 
•processing 
•during device operation
•Avoid in active region
•Thin films: graded buffers often used
•Avoid dislocations in substrate

Microscopic mechanism
GaAs thin films:
•Anisotropy of the stiffness tensor: 
Crystal structure, 3 independent 
constants

•Thickness dependence of K_IC :
Nanoindentation : mixed mode loading.
Thin film: insufficient thickness

•Interaction matrix

Prediction & Optimization
• Prediction:
Growth of thin films along <111> direction
Thickness beyond which K_IC is constant.

• Optimization
Strong substrate for ease of handling
Inherent difficulty: 2+ element basis
Graded buffers: threading dislocations glide to wafer edge
