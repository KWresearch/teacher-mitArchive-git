Big Picture
• Defect nucleation plays an important role in defect-free material volumes or if system 
size is reduced to the submicron level
• The stress required to nucleate a dislocation homogeneously sets an upper bound for the 
effectiveness of our strengthening mechanisms
• Understanding defect nucleation is part of the puzzle for understanding the breakdown 
of Hall-Petch scaling in nanocrystalline materials

Microscopic mechanism

• When a bond breaks in shear, a new 
bond will usually form immediately 
afterwards between the new atomic 
neighbors. This process of bond 
breaking and reformation controls 
defect nucleation.

• The stress needed to cause such an 
event should correspond to the 
theoretical shear strength we 
calculated in class.

• A defect should nucleate when this 
stress is reached to relieve the high 
strain energy built up at this point

Prediction & Optimization
Defect nucleation should occur when our shear stress is maximum 
and near the theoretical shear stress.

2D material analogs (bubble raft models), molecular dynamics simulations, 
and in-situ TEM indentation all support the predicted result.
