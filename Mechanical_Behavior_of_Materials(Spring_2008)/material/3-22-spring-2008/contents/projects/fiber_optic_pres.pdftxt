3.22 Mechanical Behavior of Materials

May 13, 2008

Big Picture
• Macroscopic mechanism : stress-corrosion cracking
• Subcritical crack growth in silica in the presence of 
water or water vapor
• Stress-enhanced corrosion reaction

➔ Decrease in fiber resistance
from 4.1 GPa to 2.9 GPa
over 4 weeks at 85°C 
and 85% humidity1

• Applications :
• Telecommunications
• Medical imaging

Microscopic mechanism
Slow fracture model by Michalske and Bunker
• Microscopic advancement of this 
crack cannot occur by simultaneous  
bond cleavage. 
• Kinked front allows for localized bond 
rupture process. Kink can spread 
laterally to advance the crack front.  
• Atomic site becomes 
reactive in step 4, where 
the Si are forced to give up 
their tetrahedral molecular 
orbital configuration.

To optimize mechanical properties we need to minimize flaw size 
and control exposure to water.

Prediction & Optimization 
• Prediction :

orders of magnitude ≠
between H20 and N2

σ = 100MPa, c = 150 nm
(cid:198) v = 5 nm/s

• Optimization :
– Careful handling
– Hermetic coating
• Diffusion of H+ and OH- ions into fiber (cid:198) cracks & attenuation
• Cu tubes, water-repellant jelly, water-absorbing powder
• Coating depends on environment : indoor, under water…
