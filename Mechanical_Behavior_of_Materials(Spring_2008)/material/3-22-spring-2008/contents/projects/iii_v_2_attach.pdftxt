PS2  part  b  work  detailing  calculations  of  Young’s modulus 

We  use  the  following  equation  to  solve  for  Young’s modulus  in  the  diﬀerent  directions: 

1
E[hkl] 
From  the  review  article  we  see  that 

1 
= S11  − 2[(S11  − S12 ) −  S44 ][α2β 2  + α2γ 2  + β 2γ 2 ]
2 

E<100>  = 

1 
S11 

= 8.547x1010Pa 

and  using  α = β  = γ  =  √1
3 

for  α = β  =  √1
2 

E<111>  = 1.422x1011Pa 
in  the  < 110 >  direction 

E<110>  = 1.22x1011Pa 
We  conclude  that  the  <  111  >  direction  is  the  direction  with  the  highest  Young’s  modulus, 
hence  it  will  be more  resistant  to  stretching  in  the  direction.
