May 2008

What does radiation DO?
•Material Focus: High strength steels such as T91 (Fe-9Cr-1Mo : 0.2 at% C)
•Application of interest
-Nuclear reactors

•Forms of radiation, flux in materials measured in #/(cm2*sec) ‏
-Alphas, Betas, Other Charged Particles
-Gamma Rays

•Effects on materials
•Creates defects everywhere!
(cid:190)Increased Yield Strength
(cid:190)Decreased toughness
(cid:190)Increased Rate of Surface Corrosion
(cid:190)Increased Creep Rate

Steady State Creep Rate - Coble Creep

RT

• Coble Creep
-Grain boundary diffusion
-Strongest in fine-grained materials – our steels!
-Proportional to:
•Stress
•1 / (grain size)3
•Vacancy to grain-boundary diffusion activation energy
•Typically half that for lattice diffusion

•Processing and Design to avoid Coble Creep:
-Anneal to increase grain size
-Decrease stress on components

BUT…this reduces yield strength as shown by Hall-Petch:
SO…..

Increasing strength...

...increases creep!

Graphs Constructed in Maple with 
Coble Creep Rate increases by d-2.5 faster than strength.

• Prediction – Example Decision in Reactor Design
(cid:122)Picking grain size for steel
(cid:122)Determine maximum creep rate from allowable thinning
(cid:122)Determine minimum grain size from creep rate
(cid:122)Check other parameters – strength, UTS...
