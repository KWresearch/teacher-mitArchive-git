3.22 Mechanical Behavior of Materials

May 2008

Big Picture
• Macroscopic description of the phenomenon 
(including which classes of materials exhibit this mechanical behavior)
• Engineering/scientific application of this mechanical behavior
(including why you and the rest of us care about how this works)

Use helpful graphics and/or graphs.
List concise form of key continuum-level equations.
Do not overanimate, but use if helpful.
List full citation of any work that is not your own1.

Microscopic mechanism
• Microscopic of the phenomenon 
(including how material is designed or processed to optimize mechanical 
behavior)

Use helpful graphics re: atomic, crystal, or molecular structure.
Do not overanimate, but use if helpful.
List full citation of any work that is not your own1.

Prediction & Optimization
• Prediction
(use preceding equations and knowledge to make a prediction; you’ve done 
this in the pset wikis)
• Optimization
(based on what you know now, predict structural/processing/environment 
changes to optimize your mechanical behavior of interest. This could also be 
sharing of already optimized structures, and explaining why that is the 
optimum.

Use helpful graphics.
Do not overanimate, but use if helpful.
List full citation of any work that is not your own1.
