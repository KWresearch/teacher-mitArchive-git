3.22 Mechanical Behavior of Materials

May 2008

Big Picture
• Macroscopic description of the phenomenon
• Very high tensile strength, but buckles 
easily in compression (11-63 GPA, 100-
1000x better than ASTM 1040 steel) [1]
• Very high Young’s Modulus (~1 TPa)
• Buckling behavior very similar to 
deformation of cylindrical shells [2]

Microscopic mechanism
• Microscopic behavior of Carbon Nanotube Failure
•Failure proceeds via breaking of C-C bonds
•Fracture propagation direction is a function of chirality [4]
•Sword-in-Sheath Failure predominant in MWCNT structures [5]

Prediction & Optimization
• Prediction
• Resonance can be modeled as a thin-
walled cylindrical cantilever beam [2]

• Optimization of CNT Mechanical Properties
• Minimization of crystalline defects is 
critical
• Chirality has a lesser influence on 
strength [4]
