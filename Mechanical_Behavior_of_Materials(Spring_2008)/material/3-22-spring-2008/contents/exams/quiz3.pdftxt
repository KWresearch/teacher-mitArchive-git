3.22 Mechanical Behavior of Materials 
Spring 2008 
 
Quiz 3 
 

•  Show all your work on the sheets included in this stapled document. 
•  Use partial credit to your advantage. If you're running short on time, solve algebraically and 
then solve numerically (plugging in numbers) later. 
• 
If there is not much space given for you to provide an answer, I want you to be brief. 
•  You may not need to use all the information given (e.g., dimensions) to reach your 
conclusions. 
•  Enjoy your fruit/nut mixture before getting started! Nuts and dried fruits reduce low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, decrease oxidative damage to tissues, and improve indices of 
cardiovascular disease associated with stress.

1.  In addition to predicting the mechanical responses of linear viscoelastic materials like amorphous 
polymers, springs and dashpots can be used to created models of creep and recovery in crystalline 
materials. 
 
(a) Although springs and dashpots are used to predict the behavior of amorphous polymers and 
crystalline materials in response to mechanical loading, they are predicting two very different 
ways of dissipating mechanical energy. Explain the difference, precisely but concisely, in terms 
of elasticity, plasticity, and atomic / molecular mechanisms. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b) Below is a model that accurately captures the creep and recovery response of several microcrystalline 
materials. For a step-stress applied at t=0 and removed after a long time t=t1 >> 0, 
draw how strain in the microcrystalline material evolves as a function of time, up to times much 
greater than t1 (i.e., tending toward infinity).

Your answer must be in terms of the model’s spring and dashpot values Ei and ηi, and you must 
indicate the magnitude of strain at: 
• t = 0+ (i.e., just after the stress is applied); 
• t = t1− (i.e., right before the stress is removed), 
• t = t1+ (i.e., just after the stress is removed), and 
• t = 1.

2. I am often reminded, and with good reason, that MIT students should not be treated like “brains on 
sticks”. Fair enough, but let’s consider for a moment the mechanical consequences of this mental 
picture: 
 

My first impulse is to wonder what such a stick should be made of, so that it should not buckle 
he 
under the weight of a human brain (mass = 1.4 kg). Let’s assume the stick is stuck firmly in t
ground, is 180 cm in height (approximately 6’), and is cylindrical in cross-section with the 
radius of a rat femur (1.9 mm; Horcajada et al., J. Endocrin. 165: 2000. Strangely, much 
easier to find documented rat femur radii than human femur radii.) 
 
 
(a) Motivated by the aesthetics of the human body, I decide to make these sticks of solid 7075 
T6 aluminum alloy rod with a radius of 6 mm (about that of the human spinal cord). Show 
whether the rod will buckle or not, noting the rod boundary conditions.

(b) I then realize that, because I can only fit so many brain-sticks in a lecture hall, I’ll probably 
be making cyclic use of these sturdy brain-sticks, taking off a tired brain and putting on a fresh 
brain once per week. Luckily, I know the steady-state crack growth behavior of this alloy under 
these conditions, as indicated in the graph below. 
 What is the value of R for this cyclic loading?

(d) I decide I can visually inspect each brain-stick to detect cracks on the surface that are about a = 100 
μm in length. For the cyclic stress involving the stress of one brain per brain-stick, am I in the steady-state 
crack growth regime? In other words, is my ΔK sufficient to enter the Paris law regime? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(e) Since I did not acquire these da/dN vs. ΔK data myself, I decide to figure out if I need a safety 
factor by measuring the fatigue life of one such aluminum brain-stick for a stress range of 1000 
MPa. Show exactly how I would determine how many lecture weeks can I use each brain-stick under this 
loading scheme before I should retire it for fear of fatigue failure. State any additional, needed data about the 
material required for the calculation, and how I would obtain/calculate these data. You do not have to complete 
the calculation to obtain Nf or tf. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(f) As the brain-stick is made of 7075 Al and is under cyclic axial loading, sketch how you expect the 
fatigue failure surface to appear. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i) This material is already an alloy, but I want to further extend the fatigue lifetime of the brain-stick. 
Briefly but completely describe one option to increase the fatigue life of this specific 
alloy (i.e., further alloying is not an option).

3. Choose 2 of the following 3 special topics to address briefly. Neither can be from the special topic you 
considered during the semester. 
 

(a)  In Li-based materials used for battery electrodes, mechanical failure results from cyclic stresses generated via 
repeated delithiation (phase transformation). This team estimated the failure stress from lattice mismatch strain 
and an elastically isotropic Hooke’s law. If the phases were cubic (which they are not), this prediction of critical 
stresses would be a bit more complicated due to reduced symmetry. Show how lattice mismatch strain would be 
used to compute the effective (von Mises) stress in a battery material for which both the lithiated and nonlithiated 
phases are body centered cubic. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

(b)  In semiconductor materials used for III-V device applications, cyclic stresses result from thermal cycling during 
microelectronic device application. Given a difference between a III-V thin film and its substrate to differ by 10%, 
compute the temperature required for homogeneous nucleation of a dislocation in the III-V semiconducting film. 
Estimate and justify any required physical and mechanical properties, based on knowledge of similar materials. 

(c)  In amorphous oxide glasses used for fiber optics, a model was suggested that showed water reacting with Si-O-Si 
bonds to produce 2SiOH. From models of interatomic interactions, show how uniaxial tensile stress on a defect-
free SiO2 glass could reduce the energetic barrier to hydrolysis (water breaking of Si-O bonds).
