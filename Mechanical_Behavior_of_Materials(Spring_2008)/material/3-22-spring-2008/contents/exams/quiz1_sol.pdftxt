Figure 1:  Schematic of crane used to complete construction along the Charles River, indicated with 
the  horizontal  element  of  the  crane  (a  trussed  beam)  parallel  to  the  ground.  (a)  Entire  crane;  (b) 
Hook-end of the horizontal element. 

1.	

(a)  Draw a free body diagram of the horizontal element of the crane (the horizontal span in 
Fig.  1a), treating it as a beam and indicating all known and unknown applied / reaction 
forces. You will need to make assumptions about how the crane is connected to the real 
world, and these should be brieﬂy justiﬁed. 

Solution:  The purpose of  this question  is  to conﬁrm  the basics of structural mechanics 
required to implement understanding of material mechanical behavior in context of de­
vices.  The moment about the vertical support point v, Mv  equals zero if we treat it as a 
pin.  However it does not equal zero if we treat it as a clamp.  We deﬁnitely know that it 
is not a roller because it is not free to translate. 

(b)  Consider  the  hook-end  of  the  crane’s  horizontal  element  (Fig.  1b),  now  loaded  by  the 
weight of the steel I-beam. Can member AC be made from a thin steel cable (essentially

counterweighthook (~ no mass)40 m10 mgroundq = beam weight/length = 1 kN/m30 mABCD(a)(b)weight due to hoisted I-beaman  elastic  rope)?  Here,  you’re  considering  the  elements of  the  truss  explicitly,  so  their 
weight as a whole beam structure (i.e., q ) can be neglected. Explain your answer fully. 

Solution:  Because  of  the  tensile  applied  load  at  the  hook,  segment  AB  is  in  tension. 
The sum of the forces in the y-direction must be balanced at node A (see ﬁgure below). 
Therefore,  the  force  along  segment  AC  is  in  compression  to  balance  the  tensile  force 
on AB. Since buckling may occur when the thin steel cable is loaded in compression, it 
would not be advisable to make the AC member out of cable.

(a)  We know σij  and �ij  can be expressed as quadrics,  three-dimensional  surfaces deﬁned 
by a cubic polynomial equation of σp  or �p . Explain concisely, but fully and accurately, 
what this fact immediately implies about tensorial stress and strain. 

Solution: The equation deﬁning the quadratic has three principal roots (principal stresses 
or strains) along the axes deﬁning normals to planes on which no shear components ex­
ist.  This  absence  of  shear  components  in  the  principal  stress  state  is  one  of  the  most 
important  concepts  in  stress/strain  tensor  transformations,  and  is  deﬁned  explicitly  by 
the  quadric  or  principal  root  equation  that  includes  the  invariants  I1 ,  I2 ,  and  I3 .  (It 
is also  true  that  the quadric  form demonstrates symmetry of shear elements  in  the 2nd 
rank stress and strain tensors.) 

(b)  You  are  asked  to  conﬁrm  that  your  thesis  advisor’s  following  calculations  are  correct. 
(He  is  an  expert  in  electromagnetic material  behavior,  and  often  leans  on  you  for  help 
with mechanical behavior.)  He has fabricated a metal  interconnect  line from vapor de­
posited Cu,  and x-ray diffraction has  indicated  that all  the grains  in  the polycrystalline 
line are oriented with all grain boundaries inclined 45o  with respect to the Si substrate. 
When the device is heated, your advisor expects the material at the center of the line to 
expand uniformly in all directions (neglecting the edge effects at the substrate and free 
surface).  He  therefore  predicts  that  this means  the  line  will  probably  fail  because  the 
grains will shear apart at their boundaries. Respectfully explain to him why this predic­
tion is incorrect, even if we allow for neglect of edge effects. 

Solution:  In  thermal  expansion,  a hydrostatic  strain/stress  (depending on  the material 
constraints) forms if edge effects are neglected. By deﬁnition, a hydrostatic strain/stress 
has  no  shear  components.  Therefore,  the  grains  will  not  be  under  a  driving  force  for 
shear failure. 

Some students noted  that elastic  isotropy  is unlikely  in  this case, which  is  true because 
the lines are likely textured (have the same unit cell orientation within each grain). That 
is probably true,  though not explicitly stated.  Even so,  the shear component for an lin­
ear elastic / anisotropic material would be minimal under an isotropic thermal ﬁeld. 

(c)  He  then asks you  to check a stress  transformation onto  the grain boundary planes, cal­
culated  by your  labmate,  as  shown  below.  Is  this  transformation  correct?  (You do  not 
������� 
�������
������� 
������� 
need to repeat the transformation to answer this.) 
Solution: No. The trace or ﬁrst invariant I1  of the original “tensor” and the transformed 
“tensor”  (which  is  also  asymmetric)  are  not  equal.  Also,  the  original  stress  tensor  is 
not actually a tensor in the ﬁrst place because it is asymmetric (e.g.  σij  =� σji ).

3.  A  polycrystalline,  pure  silver  (Ag)  slug  is  placed  in  a  rigid  die  as  shown,  to  create  custom 
jewelry.  Uniaxial  compressive  stress  σzz  =  σo  is  applied  normal  to  the  slug  face.  We  will 
assume the die is well lubricated at the material/die interface. 

Figure 2: Ag slug compressed within rigid die. 

(a)  Determine the orthogonal stresses σxx  and σyy  in terms of the applied stress and appro­
priate  elastic  constants  of  the  material.  Here,  note  that  there  are  constrained  and  free 
surfaces created by  the geometry of  the die,  such  that  the applied stress  is uniaxial but 
the stress state in the material is more complex. 

Solution:  The  applied  stress  σ  is  compressive.  The  slug  is  constrained  in  what  I  as­
◦
signed to be the y-direction.  Therefore, the strain in the y-direction �y  and the stress in

the x-direction σx  are zero. We can then determine the stress in the y-direction by

stants of the material.

 zzAgrigid steel die(c)  This material will deform under conditions of high shear stress.  Predict the orientation 
and magnitude of maximum shear stress resulting from this applied stress state with re­
spect to the given axis-set, being sure to indicate the plane (xy, xz, or yz) on which this 
maximum shear stress occurs. 

Solution:  This can be determined by constructing a Mohr’s circle  for each plane.  The 

maximum shear is on the xz-plane and equal to σ /2.  The orientation θ = 45◦  is given 
◦
by 2θ = 90◦  and is counter-clockwise to the original axes on the xz-plane.

(a)  When  discussing  the  atomistic  basis  of  linear  elastic  deformation,  we  considered  an 
approximate  derivation  that  related  the  Young’s  elastic  modulus  E  to  the  internal  en­
ergy U  as  a  function of  strain  �,  and  then  a more  rigorous deﬁnition  in  terms of U (r). 
In  contrast,  for  a  rubber  elastic  / hyperelastic material, we only discussed  the  rigorous 
atomistic basis  in  terms of a spring constant.  Brieﬂy explain  the difference between E 
and k  in terms of units and properties of the material. 

Solution: For a spring constant k , we deﬁne it as a force F  per unit distance x such that 

k =

and this reﬂects interatomic bond stiffness (2nd derivative of U (r) evaluated at the equi­
librium  interatomic  spacing or bond  length r  .  In  the case of Young’s elastic modulus

E , we deﬁne it in terms of bond length r and internal energy U  such that

(b)  Now  provide  the  approximate  derivation  of  the  following  elastic  constants  in  terms  of 
thermodynamic  state variables U  and S ,  and  the applied  strain �ij :  K ,  the bulk elastic 
modulus indicating resistance to dilatation (volumetric strain change) under an applied 
stress  σij  =  σii ;  and E ,  the Young’s  elastic modulus.  Give  your  solution  in  terms  of 
K (U, S, V , �) and K (U, S, V , �), where V  is the unit volume of material. 

Solution:  Under  volumetric  strain  �xx  =  �yy  =  �zz  =  �  ,  an  elastomer  expands  uni­
◦
formly  without  changing  conﬁguration  among  networked  chains  or  in  overall  shape.

Under uniaxial loading, large conﬁgurational changes occur as molecular chains stretch 
and align , resulting in a mostly entropic contribution.  Therefore

(c)  For an elastomer, state whether you expect K  to be large or small in magnitude; and E 
to be large or small in magnitude. 

Solution:  K  would  be  large  (resistant  to  dilation  or  expansion/contraction  under  hy­
drostatic stress) and E would be low (not resistant to unaxial extension as compared to 
metals).

(d)  The Poisson’s ratio of a material can be expressed in terms of K , E and G. For example,

Based  on  this  relation, what  is  the  expected  lateral  strain  resulting  from  an  axial  com­
pressive strain of 100% imposed on an elastomer? 

ν  = 

− 

Solution:  Because we expect large K  and small E , we can say that E /K  tends to zero. 
Therefore ν  = 1/2 and the material will be 50% wider if it becomes 100% shorter. 

(e)  Besides the cis-isoprene latex example discussed in class, give the name of at least one 
other actual material  that  is expected  to exhibit elastomeric behavior at  room  tempera­
ture of 22oC. 

Solution:  The purpose of  this question  is  to conﬁrm  that you know which actual mate­
rials can be analyzed as elastomers, and to conﬁrm a difference between a single chain 
capable of large reversible extensions (e.g., WLC) and an elastomeric network that can 
be  used  in  engineering  applications.  For  an  elastomer,  the material must  have  kinked 
chains  that  confer  an  entropic  penalty  upon  unkinking  (which,  individually,  could  be 
WLCs), a network with crosslinks to establish a restoring force upon removal of stress, 
and a glass transition temperature less than room temperature to confer sufﬁcient molec­
ular  mobility.  An  example  of  such  an  elastomer  is  PDMS,  or  poly(dimethylsiloxane), 
which is basically silly putty.
