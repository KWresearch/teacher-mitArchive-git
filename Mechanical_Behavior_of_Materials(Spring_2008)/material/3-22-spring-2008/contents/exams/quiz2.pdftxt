3.22 Mechanical Behavior of Materials 
Spring 2008 
 
Quiz 3 
 

•  Show all your work on the sheets included in this stapled document. 
•  Use partial credit to your advantage. If you're running short on time, solve algebraically and 
then solve numerically (plugging in numbers) later. 
• 
If there is not much space given for you to provide an answer, I want you to be brief. 
•  You may not need to use all the information given (e.g., dimensions) to reach your 
conclusions. 
•  Enjoy your fruit/nut mixture before getting started! Nuts and dried fruits reduce low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, decrease oxidative damage to tissues, and improve indices of 
cardiovascular disease associated with stress.

1. Material stiffness and strength are very different properties attributed to very different atomistic mechanisms. In <60 
words, clearly and accurately state the difference between these two concepts in a way that should be perfectly clear to 
any engineer, physicist, or chemist.

2. We have discussed that dislocations can be challenging to view via TEM because they tend to “anneal out”, or glide to 
the free surface of a thin foil (circle of D ~ 3 mm, punched from a 100 μm-thick sheet of the material). This can be 
understood with use of image forces, imaginary dislocations outside the material that exert a stress Σ according to the 
self-stress of a dislocation that is of opposite Burgers vector (but same slip plane) to the one inside the material. It is 
“upside down” outside the crystal, so it looks like an inverted mirror image:

(a) In the above diagram, two dislocations (one real and one imaginary) are shown with a common slip plane. Determine 
the forces (in terms of all appropriate variables) on the real dislocation due to its image force dislocation. To determine the 
position of the image force, consider the magnitude of stresses at a free surface. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b) Due only to the Σ imposed by the image force dislocation, under what conditions will this dislocation inside the crystal 
glide, and under what conditions will this dislocation climb? As a result, do you expect this dislocation to maintain a 
stationary location within the crystal? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(c) Why is the real dislocation “attracted” toward the surface? It may help to think of this as a composite problem. (The 
answer is NOT that there is an opposite dislocation nearby, because this is an imaginary dislocation that reflects the 
physics of the attractive forces.) 
 
 
 
 
 
(d) A foil has been prepared at room temperature, with a dislocation located a distance δ from the free surface of the foil. 
Draw what you expect the dislocation to look like when in a TEM foil in plan view, and in cross-section.

3.  
(a) For the following material, compare the magnitudes of increased strengthening (Δτ ~ Δσy) for the major strengthening 
mechanisms we’ve discussed. Estimate any required structural and mechanical properties of the phases of this material, 
based on your knowledge of similar materials. 
 
REFERENCE MATERIAL: 100% Cu of grain size d = 10 μm and dislocation density 109/cm2. 
 
ALTERED MATERIAL: 75 vol%Cu / 25 vol%Ni of grain size d = 5 μm, containing 5 vol% Cu2O3 particles of radius r = 0.1 
μm and particle/matrix surface tension of 0.1 J/m2, as well as a dislocation density of 1011/cm2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b) The main application of this material is for US coins. How would you further modify the above structural and 
mechanical properties of the ALTERED MATERIAL to reduce the energy consumption required to stamp the coins?

4. A thin sheet of amorphous polymer, shown below, has been deformed and halted prior to fracture. Using your 
knowledge of yield surfaces and energy dissipation mechanisms in such materials, clearly state the stress tensor 
components (relative value and sign, referenced to your choice of coordinate axes) that must have been imposed to result 
in such a final appearance that is visible to the eye.
