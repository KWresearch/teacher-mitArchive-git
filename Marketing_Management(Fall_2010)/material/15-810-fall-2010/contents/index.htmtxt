***** Course Description *****
15.810 Marketing Management is designed to serve as an introduction to the
theory and practice of marketing. Students will improve their ability to
develop effective marketing strategies and assess market opportunities, as well
as design strategy implementation programs. In addition, students will have the
opportunity to communicate and defend their recommendations and build upon the
recommendations of their peers. We will explore the theory and applications of
marketing concepts through a mix of cases, discussions, lectures, guest
speakers, individual assignments, and group projects. We will draw materials
from a variety of sources and settings including services, consumer and
business-to-business products.
