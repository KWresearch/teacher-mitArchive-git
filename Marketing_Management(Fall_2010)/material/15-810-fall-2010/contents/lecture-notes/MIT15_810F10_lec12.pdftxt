Compromise Effect 
The share of a product is enhanced when it is the 
intermediate option in the choice set and is diminished 
when it is an extreme option. (Simonson 1989)

November 15, 1876: Expert committee’s response to 
Hubbard & Bell’s telephone patent application

“Technically, we do not see that this device will be ever capable of sending 
recognizable speech over a distance of several miles…” 

“The idea is idiotic on the face of it. Furthermore, why would any person want 
to use this ungainly and impractical device when he can send a messenger to 
the telegraph office and have a clear written message sent to any large city in 
the United States?” 

“Mr. G.G. Hubbard's fanciful predictions, while they sound rosy, are based on 
wild-eyed imagination and lack of understanding of the technical and economic 
facts of the situation, and a posture of ignoring the obvious limitations of his 
device, which is hardly more than a toy.”

market

The Famous “Getting out of the box”

Puzzle


Image by MIT OpenCourseWare. 
• In the 70’s only 20% solved this riddle 
• In a replication (1989), participants have received 
further instructions: "In order to solve the riddle 
intersections of lines out of the imaginary square should 
be created.“ Only 25% solved it with instructions

Preschoolians Shoes 


Young children can not tell us that their shoes are too tight and the age old method of 
pressing on toes does not work. Preschoolers curl their toes when their toes are pressed on, 
making it seem that shoes are larger than they are. A study conducted by the Glasgow 
Caledonian University reveals that 83 percent of preschoolers are wearing shoes that are too 
small. This problem might seem minor, but unfortunately, tight shoes lead to foot problems 
later in life. 
A breakthrough invention by Preschoolians allows a parent to make sure shoes are never too 
tight. Preschoolians shoes look like ordinary children's footwear except for one thing: they 
have see-through bottoms to help ensure proper fit. Like the rest of the sole, the viewing 
window is made of durable polyvinyl acetate, and the parts are heat fused to prevent cracks or 
splits.

15.828 Design and Marketing New Products 

New product development may be the greatest source of profitability in the next 10 years as growth 
returns to the world’s economy. Innovation earns extra profits and ROI by filling new customer needs with 
products that command premium margins. However the process of new product development is fraught
with risk. 
In this course we study the process of design and marketing new products and how new analytic methods
can reduce risk and improve innovation. We organize our learning around the basic steps of development:
1. opportunity identification, 2. product design, 3. testing, 4. launch and life cycle management. We study
the process in the context of large, startups, consumer, and industrial companies. 
In addition to lectures and guest speakers, the course uses an intensive project on designing an
alternative fuel vehicle. The problem is how to design and market a car people “need” (low emissions and 
high efficiency), but may not “want” (most buyers want large size and power).  The obvious solution is to 
build and economy car, but this market is small (Prius sells 150,000 of over 10 million autos sold in the 
USA and most people do not buy it because it is “green”, but because it gives better mileage).  Your 
problem is to build an alternative fuel vehicle (hybrid plug in, all electric, or hydrogen) that people will buy
at a premium price. Teams will define an entry strategy (type of fuel and car type – SUV, sports car,
sedan, economy, truck, etc), design a vehicle (target segment, brand, product positioning, specs, price
dealers, etc), test it with consumers (real concept test will be done during the course), and develop a
launch plan (advertising, selling/distribution, price, etc) Your goal is to repr esent Ford, GM, or Toyota and
build a line of green cars that create a business of 500,000 vehic les by 2017 and of one million vehicles a 
year by 2022.  You are given assumptions that make this feasible, but this is a deep dive into new product
design and marketing.  Do not take this course unless you want an intensive active learning project 
course.  Each team will meet with Professor Urban each week.
