Taxonomy at the Pump: Mobil’s Five Types of Gasoline Buyers 

Road Warriors: 
Generally higher 
income middle-aged 
men who drive 25,000 
to 50,000 miles a 
year…buy premium 
with a  credit 
card…purchase 
sandwiches and drinks 
from the convenience 
store…will sometimes 
wash their cars at the 
carwash. 

16% of buyers 

True Blues: Usually 
men and women with 
moderate to high 
incomes who are loyal 
to a brand and 
sometimes to a 
particular 
station..frequently buy 
premium gasoline and 
pay in cash 

Generation F3: (for 
fuel, food and fast): 
Upwardly mobile men 
and women - half 
under 25 years of age-
who are constantly on 
the go…drive a lot and 
snack heavily from the 
convenience store 

Homebodies: 
Usually housewives 
who shuttle their 
children around 
during the day and 
use whatever 
gasoline station is 
based in town or 
along their route of 
travel.

Price Shoppers: 
Generally aren’t 
loyal to either a 
brand or a particular 
station, and rarely 
buy the premium 
line…frequently on 
tight 
budgets…efforts to 
woo them have been 
the base of marketing 
strategies for years.

Product Differentiation & 

Positioning

  Differentiation can be achieved on 
 product attributes 
 service factors 
 Image

of target consumers

product does from the consumers’ point of 
view) 

Relative to (competitive alternatives)

Shoppers’ feelings about eight stores 
helped researchers place those stores 
on a ‘map’ of perceptions. On this 
map, the vertical axis ranges from 
tradition to innovation; the horizontal, 
from luxury to thriftiness. Other 
qualities shoppers associated with one 
or more stores appear near those 
stores, revealing shoppers’ relative 
perceptions.

Developing a Positioning 

Strategy: Guiding Questions 


	 Which positions are of greatest value to our target customers, 
given their needs? 
	 Which of these positions are “taken,” and which positions are 
relatively free of competition? 
	 Which of the available positions fits best with our objectives 
and our distinctive capabilities, i.e., can we back up the 
chosen positioning by demonstrable product attributes or 
benefits? 
 	 Can we “change the rules” of the game by discovering new 
critical points of differentiation?
 	 Are all our positioning messages consistent?

Conclusion: 

STP as Marketing Strategy 

  Segmentation 
  Identify segmentation bases and segment the market 
  Develop profile of resulting segments 

  Targeting 
  Evaluate attractiveness of each segment based on 3Cs 
  Select target segments 

  Positioning 
  Use perceptual map to identify current positions 
  Identify positioning concepts for each target segment 
  Select, develop, and communicate the chosen concept

An Afterward: 

  What about personalization? And mass 
customization? 
  Information technology lowers the cost of 
  Gathering information about consumers 
  Changing the product 
  But there is still the trade-off: 
  Finer, smaller segments are expensive 
  Must produce increase in loyalty, satisfaction, and 
ultimately profits
