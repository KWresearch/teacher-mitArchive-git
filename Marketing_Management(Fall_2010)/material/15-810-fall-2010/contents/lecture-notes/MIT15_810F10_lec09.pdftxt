any other name would smell as sweet.”

most important decision in marketing of perfume is 
the name. 

- Al RiesandJack Trout,Marketing Warfare

Building Brand Equity 

. . . Response to a product due to brand 
name over and above other aspects of the 
product offering. 

	 Having it is good (we know this), but how do 
you build it (we don’t know this so well)? 

Geo Prizm & Toyota Corolla are

“twin cars”

Both are manufactured in the same 

factory in Fremont California. The 

Toyota costs $400 more and sales are 

5 times higher for the Corolla. Toyota 

earns 108M dollars more than GM.

EXAMPLE: (COLD path of pyramid) 
Building utilitarian associations with a brand
  Cadillac transforming image via performance 
  From Car and Driver Review: 
  “With a folding hardtop that completely disappears at the touch of a 
button, the XLR presents a sleek and clean profile” 
  “Under the XLR’s hood lies its most significant major mechanical 
distinction – the 4.6 liter Northstar V-8…upgraded in a variety of ways 
for improved performance, emissions, and fuel economy” 
  New ad strategy is to move from heritage—classic 
Caddies morphing into models—to performance 
(engineering and speed) 
  Benefits to revitalizing the Cadillac brand 
  Average age of buyers has dropped 
  Resale values are rising

EXAMPLE: (HOT path of pyramid) 

Building Imagery and Feelings to a Brand 


  MasterCard and the Priceless Campaign 
  Visa and American Express were targeting high end 
  Yet – there was an increase in purchasing power of “Middle
Class” Americans. 
  THEME: “Living the good life…was not the accumulation of
material things, but the sharing of meaningful moments
with loved ones and close friends.” 
  CATCH PHRASE: “There are some things money can’t buy.
For everything else there’s MasterCard.” 
  BENEFITS: 
  Global Reach: Variations in 96 countries / 45 languages 
  Accepted at more locations around the world than any
other card 
# of Cards in US: MasterCard 319 Mil  >  Visa (270 Mil)

Resonance: Brand 
Communities
  3 core components of a community 
Shared consciousness : members feel they sort of know each 
other 
  “Who else drives Broncos: Guys like myself and guys who like 
engines…” 
Rituals and traditions: way in which meaning of community is 
reproduced 
  “If you drove a Saab, whenever you passed someone else driving a 
Saab on the road, you beeped or flashed your lights.” 
Sense of moral responsibility: sense of duty to community as 
a whole 
  “we see another Saab on the road, we pull over and help, no 
matter what it is”

Extending a brand name may . . .
  Provide a point of differentiation

(less expensively)

  e.g., Hershey pudding,  

  Starbucks ice cream, instant

  Aid in communication of complex idea 
  Induce trial/reduce risk 
  Increase favorability of evaluation

Brands are 

Important and Powerful, 

but

The trouble with Brand Equity is 
that it has no consistent meaning…. 
No one knows how to measure it…

Millward Brown “Top 100 Lists”

Published in the Financial Times in April


Brand Finance “The World’s 500 Most Valuable Brands”
