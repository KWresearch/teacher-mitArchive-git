1. Economic Value to 
Customers
	 EVC  is the total (life-cycle) cost savings from using a 
new product in place of a current product. 

	 EVC = (Total ownership cost of existing product)  

– (Total ownership cost of new product) 

	 Maximum Willingness to Pay = Total 
lifecycle savings from new product compared 

with old product

Example 


	 A new synthetic motor oil is about to be 
introduced with the primary benefit that it needs 
to be changed less frequently, specifically once 
every year regardless of the mileage.  Assuming 
current oils need to be changed every 3,000 
miles at a cost of $30 per change (oil at a dollar 
a quart or a total of $5 per car, labor $20, 
disposal of oil $5) for an average car.  What is 
the EVC of the new oil to a car driver who drives 
15,000 miles per year?

Issues in Using EVC
  Customer differences 
  High vs. low mileage drivers. 

  Convincing customers 

  Other (fuzzy) benefits ignored 

  BUT, EVC can be useful in 
  Pricing 
  Segmentation 
  New product introduction

What is Customer Lifetime 

Value (CLV aka LTV)? 


• Customer Lifetime Value

is the net present value of all 
future streams of profits that a 
customer generates over the life 
of his/her business with the firm 

Prof. Natalie Mizik – 2010 MIT 15.810

Creating or Destroying 

Value? 

“In the United States, top executives 
lose their jobs when their companies 
sell too little.  In Britain, it can happen 
when their companies sell too much.” 

—The New York Times, March 31, 1993

Value of Tennis Club 

Member 

You own a tennis club where the annual membership 
fee is $300.  The average club member spends about 
$100 dollars a year at the club (in balls, drinks, snacks, 
etc.).  The annual cost of these miscellaneous goods 
(the balls, drinks, snacks, etc.) to you is $40 per 
player.  On average people who join a tennis club have 
a playing career of 7 years.  Historically, 65% of the 
members in a given year rejoin the following year. 
Investing capital at the going rate would earn a return 
of 8% a year.  Based on this information, what is the 
long-term value of a customer?

this  mktg  elective  is for YOU: 

Consumer Behavior 

15.847

Professor Joshua Ackerman 

Time is 
running 
out! 

Act 
NOW! 

How do we know what to buy? What information captures our attention? When 
are we most susceptible to being persuaded? What shapes our decisions? 
This class will help you develop a basic understanding of cognition and 
decision making as they apply to marketing contexts, and become familiar 
with the major research methods for analyzing consumer behavior 

Topics include:

this  mktg  elective  is for YOU: 

15.840: Customer Analytics Using Probability Models
  Professor Michael Braun. 
  Most of what drives customer behavior is unobservable 
  Still, there are regular patterns in activity that managers can exploit, even 
when we know nothing about specific customers 
  “Probability” lets us incorporate what we know, and don’t know, about 
these patterns, in a rigorous, systematic way 
  Goal of this class:  mastery of cutting-edge quantitative methods 
that enable you to analyze customer data correctly 
  Structured thinking, not wild, assumptions 
  Decision-making under uncertainty:  doing it well 
  Build models from the ground up (going “under the hood”), so you 
understand exactly what’s going on. 
  Full disclosure:  it’s hard-core quant. 
  Designed to be accessible to any Sloan MBA who did well in DMD. 
  Still, it’s not for everyone.  See Prof. Braun if you have question
