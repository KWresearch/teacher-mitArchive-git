Earthworks not only feeds people in an

it is helping to change the character

raise inner-city employment. Crouch,

FOUNDER: 
NORTH HAVEN FARMS 
DALLAS 

Leslie Halleck was one of the first in her 
neighborhood to start raising chickens in her 
backyard. This shift from consumption to 
production in households across America is part 
of a more self-reliant lifestyle, where thousands 
of people across the country have started to 
produce their own eggs for safety and profit. 
Halleck went one step further, creating a business 
to train and supply the growing number of locals 
who raise birds and collect eggs every day. 
Her first Saturday class drew over one hundred 
people. With the parking lot overfilled, cars 
spilled onto the shoulder.

confirms, public libraries have 
become training centers for those 
who need to brush-up on skills, 
conduct a job search, or get free 
instruction in English as a second 
language. Miriam created a series of 
networking seminars, job-retraining 
and continuing education programs. 
Once thought to be roadkill from the 
internet, Library use reached record 
levels during the recession as people 
sought education and community. 
Today sixty-eight percent of 
Americans now have a library card, 
the highest percentage ever.

To build trust with their loyal fans who had been 
hit hard by the recession, The San Francisco Giants 
developed a ‚Äúdynamic pricing‚Äù model on the belief 
that not all games are created equal. A weekend 
battle with a pennant contender or a long time rival 
like the Dodgers is worth more to a fan than a 
mid-week night game involving a cellar-dwelling 
opponent. With this in mind ticket prices were 
scaled according to demand. ‚ÄúDynamic pricing,‚Äù 
is not a new concept, says Russ Stanley, who is in 
charge of client relations for the Giants. ‚ÄúI think 
the Romans did it at the Coliseum, setting prices 
according to the quality of the lion.‚Äù

Co-founder Lynn Jurich and her partner Ed 
Fenster solved the basic problem in rooftop solar 
energy ‚Äî upfront cost ‚Äî by offering homeowners 
fixed leases on all the equipment they need to get 
off the grid. Her San Francisco firm, SunRun, gives 
homeowners guaranteed fixed energy costs for 
thirty years along with free maintenance with little 
or no initial investment. The customer signs a long-
term agreement which sets a fixed cost for power. 
If the house is sold, the contract passes on to the 
next owner. At the end of the term the owner can 
renew it, buy the system outright, or have it 
removed. SunRun‚Äôs customer base has increased 
by over four hundred percent in 2010 and has

GREAT BARRINGTON, MA 

In Western Massachusetts locals have created their 
own currency called Berkshares (named after the 
Berkshire Mountains) to help local retailers, 
restaurants and service people survive competition 
from national chains that were moving into small 
mountain towns. Thirteen bank branches, along 
with many businesses in the community, agreed to 
exchange dollars and local artists designed the 
Berkshares as elegant bills, in denominations from 
one to fifty. Tom Levin accepts them at Tom Toys, a 
shop that offers what chain stores do not: carefully 
selected stock from a worldwide network of

Some public/private partnerships are actually 
working to make life better in the post recession 
economy. A prime example is the recycling boom 
made possible by the technology and business 
model of a new start-up called RecycleBank. Using 
truck-mounted scales and bins with electronic 
identification tags, the company weighs the paper, 
glass, and metal left on the curb by individual 
households and rewards them with shopping 
discounts. Everett city recycling manager Jon Norton 
reports a big increase in recycling, a dramatic drop 
in landfill expenses, and a savings of more than $1 
million per year for local taxpayers. RecycleBank, 
meanwhile, is expanding its business across the
