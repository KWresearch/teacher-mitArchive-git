What is Marketing?

offerings that have value for
customers, clients, partners,
and society at large (AMA
2007) 

 	

 	

 	

“Everything starts with the customer”
Lou Gerstner, CEO of IBM 1993-2002
 	

“Creating shareholder wealth is not the 
purpose of the business. It is the reward 
for creating customer value”
Tracy and Wiersema in CFO magazine
 	

“My own biggest mistake in the last 20 
years was that sometimes I designed 
solutions for problems that people didn't 
yet know they had. That's why some of 
the things that could've made a 
difference couldn't find a market”
Bill Joy the ‘Edison of the Internet’
 	

	 Marketing is an organizational
function and a set of processes
for creating, communicating, and
delivering value to customers
and for managing customer
relationships in ways that benefit  	 To achieve organizational goals by 
determining the needs and wants of 
the organization and its
customers and delivering the desired 
stakeholders (AMA 2004) 
benefits more effectively and efficiently 
than competitors
