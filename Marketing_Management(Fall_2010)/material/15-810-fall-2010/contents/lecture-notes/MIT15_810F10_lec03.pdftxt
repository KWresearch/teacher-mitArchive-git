The Consumer Quiz 


 	 Asked you to estimate common marketing 
statistics

 	 Measured your confidence in these 
estimates

 	 Results?

Key Learning 


 	 You are not alone: Executives, MBA students 
in other schools make similar errors.

 	 Why do people make these “mistakes”?
 False consensus: believe that the others 

are more like yourself than they really are 

 Overconfidence: people believe that they 
are right more often than they really are

Implications for Marketing: 


 	 You are a member of 
(at most) one 
segment

 Possible Solution: 
 Customers must
provide the data, do 
not rely just on your 
intuitions 
 Globally, mktg 
research is essential

 Overconfidence keeps 

you from seeing this 


 Possible Solution:
 Diverse teams and 
involving customer 
inputs  at every stage

Motivational Approaches 


 People are less than rational, driven by 
unconscious and uncontrolled motivations
 Best  studied by observation
 Examples of motivational approaches
 For the ladies: Diet Coke (USA)
 For the fellas: Tuborg beer
 Fear appeal: Aussie underpants
 Fear appeal: More Australian underpants (Underdaks)
 Fear appeal: Philippines anti-smoking

Behavioral Approaches

 	 People, because of limited processing 
capacity, use simplified ways of making 
decisions

Prof. Natalie Mizik – 2010 MIT 15.810

12 12

Behavioral Approaches: 

Prospect Theory 

 Value is  judged 
Value 
relative to a 

reference point 


 Losses loom 
larger than gains
(estimates range 2.0-2.5) 

loss 

 Diminishing 

sensitivity 


Reference 
point can be 
shifted 

gain 

Prof. Natalie Mizik – 2010 MIT 15.810

“Value” function (similar to utility function)

Three concepts from PT 


 Reference pricing 

 Framing 

 Loss aversion 


Do these apply to you?

A beer at the beach……....
Reference Price Matters 

You are lying on the beach on a hot day.  All you have to drink is ice water.  For 
the last hour you have been thinking about how much you would enjoy a nice 
cold bottle of your favorite brand of beer.  A companion gets up to go make a 
phone call and offers to bring back a beer from the only nearby place where beer 
is sold, [a fancy resort hotel] [a small, run-down grocery store].  He says that the 
beer might be expensive and so asks how much you are willing to pay for the 
beer.  He says that he will buy the beer if it costs as much or less than the price 
you state.  But if it costs more than the price you state he will not buy it.  You 
trust your friend and there is no possibility of bargaining with the [bartender] 
[store owner].  What price do you tell him?

Applications of Prospect 

Theory 


 Reference Price 

 Defaults (Status Quo effects) 

 Framing (“Mental Accounting”) 


Prof. Natalie Mizik – 2010 MIT 15.810

18 18

Applications of PT: Reference 

price 

 Price increases hurt more than price decreases help
 Dannon yogurt
40% off !!!
Impact of the List Price: 
Bad behavioral marketing: Teach people a reference 
price of zero, as did many dot-coms.
 Comparisons in infomercials

Applications of PT: 

Rebates 

 	 Rebates are particularly good because 
at the time of purchase they are seen as a 
gain, instead of the reduction of a loss 
(framing effect)

 	 Yet while they are almost as effective as price 
cuts in boosting sales, they have ‘modest’ (20-
30%) redemption rates

 	 What does PT tell us about duration of 
promotion campaigns?

Prof. Natalie Mizik – 2010 MIT 15.810

20 20

Real Estate 


 	 What happens when 
real estate prices 
decrease?
 People are hesitant to 
realize the loss.
 Asking prices are too 
high
 Sales slow down
 Economic Theory?

 Evidence:
 Boston condos, 1990’s 
and mid-2000s
 Asking prices were 25-
35% higher than 
selling prices
 Sell more slowly
 Happens to owners 
more than investors.

Prof. Natalie Mizik – 2010 MIT 15.810

21 21

Applications: Defaults 

(Status Quo Bias) 

 Loss aversion contributes 
to a tendency to favor 
stability over change, the 
status quo is (too) often 
chosen:
 Privacy policy on web sites
 Pension plans
 Insurance choices and right 
to sue in NJ (opt-in full tort; 
21%) and in PA (opt-out; 
75%). Annual savings of 
$500. 

Prof. Natalie Mizik – 2010 MIT 15.810

22 22

Applications of PT: 

Mental Accounting 

 	 Mental accounting is categorization of money 
and spending.  Money mentally coded as gain 
or loss in a category.
 Mental accounting affects behavior
 Pay more with credit cards (like not paying)
 People pay high% interest on credit cards while keeping 
money in their saving accounts 

 Examples from your own experience? 


Prof. Natalie Mizik – 2010 MIT 15.810

Examples of Mental Accounting 

What would you do under Scenario I and Scenario II?
Scenario I:
 	 You are on your way to see a play and have a ticket which cost 
$40.  When you arrive at the theater, you discover that you have 
lost your ticket.  Would you buy another?
Scenario II:
 	 You are on your way to see a play and are about to purchase a 
ticket which cost $40.  As you step up to the box office, you 
discover you have $40 less in you pocket than you thought when 
you left home.  Would you still buy the ticket?

 	 Jackie is shopping with a friend. She need to buy a calculator.  The 
store offers a price of $50.  A friend tells her that another store, 
which is 10 block away is selling the same calculator for $40. 
Jackie decides to go to the other store.    Jane goes to a store to 
buy a TV.  The store offers a price of $500.  Jane’’s friend tells her 
that another store, which is 10 blocks away, is selling the same TV 
for $490.  Jane decides it is not worth walking 10 blocks for $10 
savings.

Summary
 How do Customer think?
 Customers think differently (than what standard 
economic theory predicts), but systematically.
 They judge value:
 Relative to a reference level.
 Losses loom larger than gains.

 How do you think about customers?
 They are more different than you realize
 You are overconfident of it
