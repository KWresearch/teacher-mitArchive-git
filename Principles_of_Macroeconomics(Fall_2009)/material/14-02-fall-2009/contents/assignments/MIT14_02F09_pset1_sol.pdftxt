1 True/False/Uncertain [40 points]

Please state whether each of the following claims are true, false or uncertain,
and provide a brief justi(cid:133)cation for your answer.

1. "An increase in the price of a good that is imported into the US - holding
all other prices and quantities (cid:133)xed - will tend to increase the GDP de(cid:135)ator
in the US" [ 8 points]
ANSWER. False. The GDP de(cid:135)ator uses information from nominal and
real GDP, which means it only takes into account good produced in the
US. The imported good was produced abroad.

2. "In an economy with only two goods, the choice of the base year (b) will
not a⁄ect the growth rate of real GDP with base year b, as long as the
relative price between the goods (that is, the ratio of the price of one good
to the price of the other) is constant over time" [ 8 points]
ANSWER. True. Proof

y b
t = p1b q1t + p2b q2t
p1b q1t+1 + p2b q2t+1
t+1 (cid:17) y b
t+1 =y b
g b
p1b q1t + p2b q2t (cid:0) 1
t (cid:0) 1 =
q1t+1 + (p2b =p1b ) q2t+1
=
q1t + (p2b =p1b ) q2t (cid:0) 1
But if relative prices are constant, that means p2b =p1b = p2 =p1 which is
t+1 is also independent of b.
independent of b. Hence, g b
3. "An increase in the stock of capital of an economy tends to increase the
real wage" [ 8 points]
ANSWER. True. A higher stock of K increases the marginal product
of labor, which increases labor demand, which tends to increase the real
wage.

4. "The shorter the duration of a given increase in the real wage, the stronger
the income e⁄ect is" [ 8 points]
ANSWER. False. It is exactly the other way around. See page 82 of
textbook.

5. "Skill-biased technical change, through its e⁄ect on labor supply, can gen-
erate an increase in wage inequality" [ 8 points]
ANSWER. False. Skill biased technical change a⁄ects the demand for
skilled and unskilled workers. Not the labor supplies. See page 91 of the
textbook.

2 Macro Data [40 points]

Suppose that there are only 2 goods in the economy (denoted by A and B). We
have yearly data on prices (p) and quantities produced (q) for each good for the
period 2001-2004

1. Compute the nominal GDP for each year [8 points]
ANSWER.
Y2000 = 1 (cid:3) 1 + 2 (cid:3) 2 = 5
Y2001 = 2 (cid:3) 2 + 4 (cid:3) 2 = 12
Y2002 = 2 (cid:3) 3 + 3 (cid:3) 1 = 9
2. Compute, for each year in the sample, the real GDP with base-year 2000.
Do the same using 2001 and 2002 as base years [8 points]
ANSWER.
y00
00 = 1 (cid:3) 1 + 2 (cid:3) 2 = 5; y00
01 = 1 (cid:3) 2 + 2 (cid:3) 2 = 6; y00
02 = 1 (cid:3) 3 + 2 (cid:3) 1 = 5
01 = 2 (cid:3) 2 + 4 (cid:3) 2 = 12; y01
00 = 2 (cid:3) 1 + 4 (cid:3) 2 = 10; y01
y01
02 = 2 (cid:3) 3 + 4 (cid:3) 1 = 10
01 = 2 (cid:3) 2 + 3 (cid:3) 2 = 10; y02
00 = 2 (cid:3) 1 + 3 (cid:3) 2 = 8; y02
y02
02 = 2 (cid:3) 3 + 3 (cid:3) 1 = 9
3. Compute the GDP de(cid:135)ator for each year in the sample, using 2001 as base
year. Compute the corresponding in(cid:135)ation rate for each year. Would you
get a di⁄erent value for in(cid:135)ation if instead you used 2000 as a base year?
[8 points]
ANSWER.
00 = 0:5, P 01
01 = 1; P 01
P 01
02 = 9=10 = 0:9
De(cid:133)ne in(cid:135)ation as the growth rate in prices, that is (cid:25) t+1 = (Pt+1 (cid:0) Pt ) =Pt
0:5 = 100% ; (cid:25)2002 = 0:9(cid:0)1
(cid:25)2001 = 1(cid:0)0:5
1 = (cid:0)10%

4. Suppose that the basket of goods used by the Government to compute
the CPI consists of 1 unit of good A and 4 units of good B. Using 2001
as the base-year, compute the CPI and also the CPI based in(cid:135)ation rate
for each year. How do the numbers for CPI based in(cid:135)ation compare with
the numbers for GDP de(cid:135)ator based in(cid:135)ation obtained above? Do you get
more or less de(cid:135)ation between 2001 and 2002? Explain brie(cid:135)y. [8 points]
ANSWER.
2(cid:3)1+4(cid:3)4 = 0:5, C P I01 = 1 ; C P I02 = 2(cid:3)1+3(cid:3)4
C P I00 = 1(cid:3)1+2(cid:3)4
2(cid:3)1+4(cid:3)4 = 0:78 ;
02 = 0:78(cid:0)1
01 = 100% ;(cid:25)CP I
(cid:25)CP I
1 = (cid:0)22%
Note that we get the same number for in(cid:135)ation between 2000 and 2001,
but we get a bigger level of de(cid:135)ation between 2001 and 2002. This is
because the Government(cid:146)s basket has a lot of good B, which is the one
whose price is falling.

5. Compute the growth rates of the chain-weighted real GDP for 2000-2001
and 2001-2002. For the growth rate between 2000 and 2001, does it make
a di⁄erence to use the chain index as opposed to the growth rate of real
GDP with base year, say, 2000? Why? [8 points]
ANSWER. For the growth rate between 2000 and 2001, we have

Note that for the growth rate between 2000 and 2001, g00
01 . That is,
01 = g01
the base year is irrelevant. Thus, the chain index doesnt make a di⁄erence.
The reason is that relative prices did not change between 2000 and 2001.

3 Production functions [20 points]

Suppose there are two factors of production: capital (K) and labor (N). Let A
be a technological parameter (take it as given)
Answer the following:

1. Does any of the following production functions exhibit constant returns
to scale? Justify your answer with a one-line proof [10 points]

(a) Y = AK 0:4N 0:6
(b) Y = AK (cid:11)N (cid:12) , with (cid:11) + (cid:12) > 1
(c) Y = min (K; N )
ANSWER. Only (a) and (c) have constant returns. Proof: Let (cid:21) (cid:21) 1
a. (cid:21)Y = A ((cid:21)K )0:4 ((cid:21)N )0:6

b. A ((cid:21)K )(cid:11) ((cid:21)N )(cid:12) = A(cid:21)(cid:11)+(cid:12) K (cid:11)N (cid:12) > A(cid:21)K (cid:11)N (cid:12) (if we increase each
input by a factor of (cid:21), output increases by a a factor bigger than (cid:21)). This
function has increasing returns to scale.
c. min ((cid:21)K; (cid:21)N ) = (cid:21) min (K; N )

2. Suppose that the production function is given by Y = C + K (cid:11)N 1(cid:0)(cid:11) ,
where C is a positive constant. Does an increase in C a⁄ect the marginal
product of any factor? Will it a⁄ect labor productivity? [10 points]
ANSWER. No, an increase in C will not a⁄ect the MPK nor the MPN.
Yes, it will a⁄ect labor productivity:

Y =N = C + K (cid:11)N 1(cid:0)(cid:11)
