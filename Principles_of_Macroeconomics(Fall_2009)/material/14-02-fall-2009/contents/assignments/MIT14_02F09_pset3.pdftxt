1 True/False/Uncertain [30 points]

1. "In the Solow model, an economy that starts with a higher stock of capital
per capita will reach a higher steady state level of capital per capita" [7
points]

2. " In the money market, a decrease in real income will tend to decrease the
equilibrium interest rate (abstracting from the goods market)" [7 points]

3. "If prices adjust inmediately, then monetary policy will have no e⁄ect
whatsover" [8 points]

4. "Fiscal policy cannot a⁄ect output in the long run" [8 points]

2 Solow Model [ 40 points]

Consider the basic solow model. Assume total labor is (cid:133)xed at L = 1. Time is
discrete, and indexed by t = 0; 1; 2; ::: The production function is Cobb Douglas:

yt = f (kt ) = Ak(cid:11)
t

where yt is per capita income at time t and kt is capital per capita at time t.
The law of motion for the capital stock is

kt+1 = (1 (cid:0) (cid:14)) kt + it
where it is per capita investment. The economy consumes a constant fraction
of output:

(1)
ct = (1 (cid:0) s) yt
where s 2 (0; 1). Assume that the economy starts with initial capital k0 > 0:

1. Show that equation (1) implies that per capita investment is also a con-
stant fraction of per capita income. Which equation, which was not stated
in the set up of this question, do you need to show this? [4 points]

2. Using the previous result, state a law of motion for capital per capita.
This is, an equation relating kt+1 to kt . [4 points]

3. Compute the steady state capital per capita in this economy. Call it k .
Also, compute the level of investment per capita (i) and income per capita
(y) in the steady state. [6 points]

4. We will now derive an analytical expression for the evolution of the per
capita capital stock in this economy. Assume from now on that (cid:14) = 1,
that is, that the capital stock fully depreciates in one period.

(a) Write k1 as a function of k0 : [2 points]
(b) Write k2 as a function of k1 , and, using (a), as a function of k0 .
points]
(c) Write k3 as a function of k0 . [2 points]
(d) Now, in light of the 3 previous answers, write an equation that gen-
eralizes to any t. That is, write kt as a function of k0 for any t (cid:21) 01 .
[7 points]
(e) Show that the limit (as t ! 1) of the expression you just got is
exactly k (the steady state level of capital derived in point 4). That
is, show limt!1kt = k . [Hint: Recall that for any constant x 2 (0; 1):
P1i=0 xi = 1
1(cid:0)x ] [3 points]
5. Using the analytical expression derived in point 5 (d), plot the evolution
of the per capita capital stock in this economy. Take s = 0:2, A = 1,
(cid:11) = 0:5 (and of course, (cid:14) = 1). That is, plot kt as a function of t. Do this
graph for both the case in which k0 = 1 and k0 = 0:01:[10 points]

3 IS-LM [30 points]

Consider the following version of the IS-LM model, where expected in(cid:135)ation is
zero ((cid:25)e = 0). Assume net exports (NX) are zero.

C = c0 + c1 (Y (cid:0) T )
I = b0 + b1Y (cid:0) b2 i
M d=P = d1Y (cid:0) d2 i
M s = M

where all the variables are as de(cid:133)ned in class, and T represents taxes.

1. Find the I S relation. What assumption on the parameters do we have
to impose to ensure that the goods market reaches an equilibrium? Show
graphically happens to this relation when taxes increase. [6 points]

2. Derive the LM relation. What happens when M increases? Explain the
intuition. [6 points]

3. Find the short-run equilibrium (i.e. (cid:133)nd the pair (Y ; i) that makes the
goods and money markets both be in equilibrium at the same time) [6
points]

4. What happens to equilibrium output and the interest rate as taxes in-
crease? Use your results from the previous part, as well as the IS-LM
graph to illustrate your answer. [6 points]

5. What happens to equilibrium output and the interest rate as money supply
increases? [6 points]
