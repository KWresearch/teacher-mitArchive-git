1 True/False/Uncertain [20 points]

Please state whether each of the fol lowing claims are True, False or Uncertain,
and provide a brief justi(cid:133)cation for your answer.

1. "An increase in the real interest rate makes current consumption relatively
cheaper than future consumption" [6 points]
ANSWER. FALSE. It is the other way around. By increasing the return
on savings, an increase in the real interest rate makes future consumption
relatively more attractive.

2. "The Keynesian consumption function, which implies that agents consume
a constant fraction of their income, does not match short run household
data" [7 points]
ANSWER.FALSE. Agents consume a constant fraction of an extra dollar
of income. However, the average propensity to consume (C=Yd ) falls with
income (rich people save more). The part about not matching short run
data is correct.

3. "If an agent is liquidity constrained, then an unexpected increase in tran-
sitory income of $100 can result in the agent(cid:146)s current consumption in-
creasing by $100" [7 points]
ANSWER. TRUE (or Uncertain). Without liquidity constraints we
know that agents will only consume a fraction of the $100 and save the
rest. But if agents are liquidity constrained, and are consuming less than
what they would want to smooth consumption, then they will consume
the extra income 1 to 1"

2 Labor market [40 points]

Consider an economy in which the labor market is competitive. There is a large
number of (cid:133)rms each with technology given by the following production function

Y = AK (cid:11)N 1(cid:0)(cid:11)

1

where Y denotes the (unique) consumption good, K denotes capital stock, and
N denotes labor input (in hours) in production.
There is also a large number of agents who supply labor, with preferences
given by

u (c; l) = log (c) + (cid:17) log (l)
where l denotes leisure and c denotes consumption. Each of these agents has T
hours of time (monthly) to allocate between leisure and labor. The only source
of income for the agents is labor income.
Assume that the price of the consumption good (denote it by P ) is exoge-
nously given and equal to 2. Use W to denote the hourly nominal wage in the
economy

1. What is the marginal product of labor (MPN)? How does MPN change as
N increases? Explain brie(cid:135)y why. [4 points]
ANSWER.

K (cid:11)
M P N = (1 (cid:0) (cid:11)) A
N (cid:11)
MPN is decreasing in N. The reason is that there is a (cid:133)xed factor of
production, capital (K). As we add units of labor output increases but
each time by less, since the additional units of labor need to share the
(cid:133)xed amount of capital available.

2. What is the optimal amount of labor that each (cid:133)rm will demand? Sketch
the labor demand as a function of the real wage (using the y-axis for the
real wage, and x-axis for labor) [4 points]
ANSWER.

(1 (cid:0) (cid:11)) A

M P N = W=P
K (cid:11)
N (cid:11) = W=2
N = (cid:18) (1 (cid:0) (cid:11)) A2
(cid:19) 1
(cid:11)
W
3. Now suppose that the Government introduces a labor tax: for each hour
of labor hired, the (cid:133)rm needs to pay (cid:28) to the Government. Find the new
optimal demand for labor. Is it higher or lower than in the absence of the
tax? [4 points]
ANSWER.

K

(1 (cid:0) (cid:11)) A

M P N = (1 + (cid:28) ) W=P
K (cid:11)
N (cid:11) = (1 + (cid:28) ) W=P
N = (cid:18) (1 (cid:0) (cid:11)) A2
(1 + (cid:28) ) W (cid:19) 1
(cid:11)
For each W/P, the amount of labor demanded by the (cid:133)rm is lower.

4. Consider now the decision problem of the agents. Let n denote the number
of hours per month that an agent works. Write an equation relating n and
l. Write the agent(cid:146)s budget constraint. Express the budget constraint in
terms of c and l. State the agent(cid:146)s maximization problem. [4 points]
ANSWER

n + l = T
nW = P c(cid:0) > T W = P c + W l

log (c) + (cid:17) log (l)

max
c;l
s:t:
T W = P c + W l

5. Use the fact that the marginal utility of consumption and leisure is given
by

M U (C ) = 1=c
M U (L) = (cid:17)=l

to (cid:133)nd an equation that characterizes the optimal behavior of the agent
regarding consumption and leisure. This should be an equation on c and l
as a function of the real wage. Use this equation, and the budget constraint
of the agent to (cid:133)nd the optimal amount of leisure. Use the equation
relating n and l from the previous question to (cid:133)nd the optimal number of
hours n. [4 points]
ANSWER. From p. 21 in the lecture notes:

M U (L) =M U (C ) = W=P

6. Suppose that the real wage increases. Does the agent work more, less or
the same? Explain why. [2 points]
ANSWER. The last equation shows that the agent works the same. La-
bor supply is independent of the real wage. This is just a very particular
example in which income and substitution e⁄ects just cancel out.

7. Suppose that (cid:17) increases. What is the e⁄ect on the agents labor supply?
[2 points]
ANSWER. n decreases. (cid:17) measures how much the agent cares of leisure.

8. Suppose that there are Ma agents in the economy (where Ma is a very
large number). What is the total labor supply? (denote it by N s ) Suppose
that there are Mf (cid:133)rms in the economy (where Mf is a very large number).
What is the total labor demand in the economy? (denote it by N d ) (we
continue to assume that the Government is taxing labor). [4 points]
ANSWER.
(1 + (cid:28) ) W (cid:19) 1
N d = Mf (cid:18) (1 (cid:0) (cid:11)) A2

9. Assume that Mf = Ma . Find the real wage that makes total labor supply
and total labor demand exactly equal to each other (this is called, the
equilibrium real wage). Find the equilibrium number of hours worked in
this economy.[4 points]

10. For each of the following cases, explain what is the e⁄ect on the equilibrium
wage and number of hours worked. Provide a brief sketch showing how
labor supply and demand shift. Also provide intuition. [8 points]

=

a. Increase in T
ANSWER. The equilibrium wage decreases and the equilibrium number
of hours worked increases, when T goes up. The reason is that labor
supply goes up.
b. Increase in K
ANSWER. An increase in K increases labor demand (due to comple-
mentarities between inputs, K increases M P N ). Thus the equi-
librium wage goes up, and the equilibrium number of hours stays
constant (since supply is vertical).

4

c. Increase in (cid:28) .
ANSWER. An increase in (cid:28) decreases the real wage (and has no e⁄ect
on the number of hours worked) since it decreases labor demand ((cid:28)
increases the e⁄ective cost of workers faced by (cid:133)rms).

3 Consumption [40 points]

Consider an economy with two periods (current and future). There are 2 agents
(call them agent A and agent B). There is only one good in the economy1 .
Suppose that agent i 2 fA; B g has an income of y i in the current periods
and y i
f in the future period. Note that we are allowing income endowments to
be di⁄erent for di⁄erent agents and periods. Both agents are foward looking
(which just means they care about the present and the future). In particular,
they consume according to the following rule

ci
1 = (cid:11)iP V LRi

where ci is consumption in the current by agent i, PVLR is the present value of
lifetime resources, and (cid:11)A ; (cid:11)B are numbers such that (cid:11)i 2 (0; 1) for i = A and
i = B . Note that we are allowing the consumption rule to vary across agents.
Denote consumption in the future period for agent i by ci
f and the real interest
rate by r .

1. Let si denote agent i(cid:146)s savings in the current [In the lecture notes, this is
just the leftover after consumption]. Write the budget constraint for each
period for agent i. These are called "(cid:135)ow" budget constraints. Show how
you can obtain an intertemporal budget constraint for agent i out of the
two (cid:135)ow budget constraints. [Basically just substitute out "si " to obtain
an equation that relates the PVLR with ci and ci
f .] [5 points]
ANSWER. For i 2 fA; B g
ci + si = y i
f = (1 + r) si + y i

3. For a given interest rate r, plot the combinations of ci and ci
f that the
agent can choose. The set you just plotted is called the budget set.
[5
points]
ANSWER. See the graph on page 12 in Lecture notes.

4. Show graphically the e⁄ect of an increase in the interest rate on the budget
set of agent i. [5 points]
ANSWER. See page 33 in lecture notes.

5. Express ci ; ci
f as functions of (cid:11)i ; y i ,y i
f and r . [6 points]

6. Write an equation that states that the total demand for the good in the
current period equals total supply [total demand is the sum of consumption
by each agent, and total supply is the sum of each agent(cid:146)s income]. We call
this equation the goods market clearing condition. Find the equilibrium
interest rate in this economy, and denote it by r* [this is just the interest
rate that makes supply and demand coincide] [7 points]

7. Suppose yA = yB
f = yB = 4 and (cid:11)A = (cid:11)B = 1=2. Find the
f = 2 ; yA
equilibrim interest rate, and the levels of consumption for both periods for
each agent. Relate your numerical answers to the concept of consumption

this economy? [7 points]

4 = 3 = cB

Both agents are able to perfectly smooth consumption over time. In the
(cid:133)rst period A is borrowing 1 unit of the good from B. In period 2, A
returns that unit of the good to B so that both agents consume 3 in each
period.
