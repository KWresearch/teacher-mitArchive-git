1 Intergenerational altruism and Ricardian Equivalence (50
points)

The country of Bequestia has only two consumers, Joe Senior and Joe Junior. At time t = 0; Joe
Senior is young, and Joe Junior has not been born yet. At time t = 1; Joe Senior is old and Joe
Junior is born, and at t = 2 Joe Junior is old and Joe senior is dead. They are both PIH consumers
with preferences given by:

U (cyoung ; cold ) = ln cyoung + (cid:12) ln cold
where (cid:12) 2 [0; 1]: Both Joes have an income of yyoung = 10 when young and yold = 10 when old. The
interest rate is r > 0:

1. (5 points) Write both consumers(cid:146) intertemporal budget constraints.

ANSWER: They are the same for both:

10
1 + r (cid:21) cyoung +
2. (5 points) Using the optimality condition cold = (cid:12) (1 + r)cyoung and the budget constraint, (cid:133)nd
each consumers(cid:146) consumptions as a function of r and (cid:12) :

1 + r

ANSWER: It(cid:146)s the same for both:

3. (6 points) Find the aggregate consumption Ct and savings St of the economy at times t = 0; 1; 2:

C2 =

10 (2 + r)
(1 + (cid:12) ) (1 + r)

S0 = Y0 (cid:0) C0 = 10 (cid:0)

10(cid:12) (2 + r)
(1 + (cid:12) )

S1 = 20 (cid:0)

S2 = 10 (cid:0)

4. (7 points) Now assume that the government of Bequestia decides to spend G = 5 at t = 0 and
give it as gift to Joe Senior. The gift will be (cid:133)nanced by lump-sum taxes T at t = 2. Since the
government must satisfy its intertemporal budget constraint,

T
(1 + r)2 = 0:
Find the level of consumption and saving for the economy at t = 0; 1; 2 as a function of r and
(cid:12) :

G +

ANSWER: Now Joe Senior(cid:146)s income at t = 0 is 10 + G = 15 and Joe Junior(cid:146)s income at t = 2
(when he(cid:146)s old) is 10 + T = 10 (cid:0) 5(1 + r)2 : The consumption of Joe Senior is given by:
10 + (1 + r)15
cyoung =
(1 + r) (1 + (cid:12) )
10 + (1 + r)15
(1 + (cid:12) )

cold = (cid:12)

and the consumption of Joe Junior is

cyoung =

10(1 + r) + 10 (cid:0) 5(1 + r)2
(1 + r) (1 + (cid:12) )
10(1 + r) + 10 (cid:0) 5(1 + r)2
(1 + (cid:12) )

cold = (cid:12)

Therefore,

C0 =

10 + (1 + r)15
(1 + r) (1 + (cid:12) )
10(1 + r) + 10 (cid:0) 5(1 + r)2
10 + (1 + r)15
(1 + (cid:12) )
(1 + r) (1 + (cid:12) )
10(1 + r) + 10 (cid:0) 5(1 + r)2
(1 + (cid:12) )

+

C1 = (cid:12)

C2 = (cid:12)

10 + (1 + r)15
S0 = Y0 (cid:0) C0 = 15 (cid:0)
(1 + r) (1 + (cid:12) )
10(1 + r) + 10 (cid:0) 5(1 + r)2
10 + (1 + r)15
S1 = 20 (cid:0) (cid:12)
(cid:0)
(1 + (cid:12) )
(1 + r) (1 + (cid:12) )
10(1 + r) + 10 (cid:0) 5(1 + r)2
S2 = 10 (cid:0) 5(1 + r)2 (cid:0) (cid:12)
(1 + (cid:12) )

5. (6 points) Does Ricardian equivalence hold in this economy? Why?

ANSWER: It doesn(cid:146)t. Consumption has gone up at t = 0 and down at t = 2 after a rise in
government spending (cid:133)nanced with future taxes. This is because there is no intergenerational
altruism.

From now on, assume Joe Senior cares about Joe Junior(cid:146)s future, and his utility function is
now

U (cyoung ;sr ; cold;sr ; cyoung ;j r ; cold;j r ) = ln cyoung ;sr + (cid:12) ln cold;sr + (cid:12) ln cyoung ;j r + (cid:12) 2 ln cold;j r

where cyoung ;sr is Senior(cid:146)s consumption when young, cyoung ;j r is junior(cid:146)s consumption when
young and so on. Junior does not solve a consumption problem, he simply follows the con-
sumption path that Senior picks for him. Income of Senior and Junior remain the same as
before. Government spending and taxes are zero in all periods.

6. (5 points) Find the consumption of Joe Senior and his bequest to (consumption of ) Joe Junior.
[Hint: with (cid:12) = 1; r = 0 you need to do very little math. Why?]

ANSWER: By symmetry,

cyoung ;sr = cold;sr = cyoung ;j r = cold;j r :

Together with the budget constraint

40 = cyoung ;sr + cold;sr + cyoung ;j r + cold;j r

gives

cyoung ;sr = cold;sr = cyoung ;j r = cold;j r = 10:

7. (5 points) How does Senior(cid:146)s consumption pattern in part 6 compare to that in part 2?

ANSWER: For part 2

cyoung = cold = 10;

that is, Senior smoothes completely as he is a PIH consumer. For part 6, he also smoothes
completely across his consumption and Junior(cid:146)s consumption. There is no change in the con-
sumption patterns.

8. (5 points) Now the government implements the same spending pattern as in part 4, with G = 5
at t = 0 (cid:133)nanced by taxes at time t = 2: Find Senior and Junior(cid:146)s consumption pattern.

ANSWER: We still have cyoung ;sr = cold;sr = cyoung ;j r = cold;j r ; and since the budget con-
straint remains unchanged, consumption is the same as in part 7:

9. (6 points) Does Ricardian equivalence hold in this economy? Why?

ANSWER: Yes, Ricardian equivalence holds. Aggregate consumption and savings did not
change when the government implemented the spending and tax policy. The key assumption
that gave us this result was that Senior cares about Junior(cid:146)s future consumption.

BONUS (10 points) Would Ricardian equivalence hold if Senior(cid:146)s utility function is

a) U (cyoung ;sr ; cold;sr ; cyoung ;j r ; cold;j r ) = ln cyoung ;sr + (cid:12) ln cold;sr + (cid:12) 2 ln cold;j r ?

What about

b) U (cyoung ;sr ; cold;sr ; cyoung ;j r ; cold;j r ) = ln cyoung ;sr + (cid:12) ln cold;sr + (cid:12) ln cyoung ;j r ?

ANSWER: In general, it won(cid:146)t hold in either case. For the particular G and T picked in this
question, it would hold for a) but not for b):

2 Rules of thumb and Ricardian Equivalence (50 points)

Consider an economy where savings follow the rule of thumb that they are a constant fraction s of
income, i.e. St = sYt with s 2 (0; 1): The production function is Yt = AtL1=2 ; and the labor force
is (cid:133)xed at L = 1: The growth rate of productivity is g ; i.e. At+1 = (1 + g)At ; with A0 = 1: The
government spends Gt each period and collects a lump-sum tax of Tt : The economy exists for three
periods t = 0; 1; 2:

t = Yt (cid:0) Tt (cid:0) Ct and public savings S gov
1. (8 points) Find the path for private savings S pvt
t = T (cid:0) G
if Gt = Tt = 0 for all t:
t = St (cid:0) S gov
ANSWER: S pvt
t = St = sYt = s(1 + g)t :
2. (8 points) Find the path for private savings if government spending is (cid:133)xed at a fraction
p 2 (0; 1) of GDP and the government is running a balanced budget every period.
ANSWER: The since the government is running a balanced budget, T = G and thus

t = St (cid:0) S gov
S pvt
t = St = sYt = s(1 + g)t

3. (8 points) Now consider the case where the government spends G0 = pY0 and zero in all other
periods, and collects taxes T2 = pY2 in period 2: Find private and public savings. Find the
path for consumption.

0 = s (cid:0) p

1 = s
= S2 (cid:0) S gov
2 = (s (cid:0) p)(1 + g)2

4. (8 points) In order to implement the policy in part 3, the government borrows in period 0
and re-pays its debt in period 2 using the money collected from taxes. Find the maximum
per-period interest rate r that the government is willing to pay.

ANSWER: The government borrows p and can repay up to (1 + g)2p;so r = g :

5. (8 points) Is there Ricardian equivalence in this economy? Explain. [Hint: Ricardian equivalence
has to do with aggregate savings and consumption].

ANSWER: No. Income is exogenous and aggregate savings are a constant fraction of income,
thus neither income nor aggregate savings are a⁄ected by government spending or taxes. How-
ever, since Y = C + I + G and I = S; changes in G must be completely o⁄set by changes in
C; so changes in G are re(cid:135)ected one-to-one into changes in C: The mechanism whereby agents
decide to consume less and save more in anticipation to a future increase in T is not present
in this model.

6. (10 points) Now assume that aggregate savings S is allowed to depend on G (as well as Y as
before.) Find a dependence that S must have on G so that Ricardian equivalence holds in this
economy.

ANSWER: We must have that changes in G do not a⁄ect the desire to consume or save.
Assume S is a function of G; for example S = sY + f (G): We will solve for f (G):

S = sY + f (G) = Y (cid:0) G (cid:0) C
C = Y (cid:0) G (cid:0) sY (cid:0) f (G)
If we want to have C unchanged for any value of G; then f (G) = (cid:0)G: This means that when
the government increases government spending by one dollar, savings decrease by one dollar.
