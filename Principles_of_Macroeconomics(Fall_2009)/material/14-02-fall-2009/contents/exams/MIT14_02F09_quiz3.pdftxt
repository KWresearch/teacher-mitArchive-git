1 Multiple Choice (30 points)

1. [6 points] An increase in domestic prices:

(a) Depreciates the domestic currency.

(b) Appreciates the domestic currency.

(c) Has an ambiguous e⁄ect on the domestic currency.

2. [6 points] In the short run, a contractionary monetary policy in an open economy...

(a) Contracts output and generates a depreciation.

(b) Contracts output and generates an appreciation.

(c) Expands output and generates a depreciation.

3. [6 points] There is a 30% tax levied on income above $15,000. A person with income of $18,000
faces:

(a) A marginal tax rate of 30% and an average tax rate of 30%.

(b) A marginal tax rate of 30% and an average tax rate of 25%.

(c) A marginal tax rate of 30% and an average tax rate of 5%.

4. [6 points] Consider a 2 country world, countries A and B. If under autarky the interest rates
satisfy rA > rB , after integration:

(a) Savings and investment in country A decrease.

(b) Savings decrease in country A and country B.

(c) Savings in country A and investment in country B decrease.

5. [6 points] Deposit insurance...

(a) Is a succesful tool in preventing bank runs but it is costly for the government.

(b) Is a succesful tool in preventing bank runs and it may not be costly for the government.

(c) Has not proven to be a succesful tool in preventing bank runs.

2 Barro 1979 (35 points)

Consider the 2 period consumption model. Denote ct consumption and yt income at time t = 1; 2.
Consumers and government may save and borrow at period t = 1 at a given interest rate r: Each
period, the government collects lump sum taxes tt and government expenditures are gt : Income,
taxes and government expenditures are exogenous for the consumer. Utility for consumers is given
by U (c1 ; c2 ) = u (c1 ) + (cid:12)u (c2 ) : Assume (cid:12) (1 + r) = 1:

1. [2 points] Obtain the intertemporal budget constraint for the consumer.

2. [2 points] Obtain the intertemporal budget constraint for the government.

2

3. [6 points] Combine the previous expressions to sketch a proof of the statement "The timing of
taxes does not a⁄ect consumption choices as long as the present value of consumption is not
a⁄ected".

4. Let us consider the case in which taxation is no longer a one-to-one transfer of purchasing power
from consumers to the government. In particular, assume that when taxes tt are collected, an
t of income is wasted, where b is a positive constant. We may think of this
amount (cid:13) (tt ) = bt2
as collection costs or "deadweight losses." The marginal loss given by (cid:13) 0 (t) = 2bt is increasing
in t:

(a) [3 points] Obtain the intertemporal budget constraint for the consumer.

3

(b) [2 points] Obtain the intertemporal budget constraint for the government.

(c) [5 points] Does the Ricardian equivalence still hold? Explain.

4

(d) [4 points] Suppose that the consumer could choose the timing of taxes sub ject to the
intertemporal budget constraint for the government. Recall that under the assumption
(cid:12) (1 + r) = 1; c1 = c2 : State the maximization problem to determine the optimal choice
of t1 and t2 : No need to solve.

(e) [2 points] Interpret the following two conditions that determine optimal tax collection.

2bt(cid:3)1 = 2bt(cid:3)2
g2
= t(cid:3)1 +
1 + r

t(cid:3)2
1 + r

g1 +

5

(f ) [4 points] Solve for the optimal tax path.

(g) [5 points] Use your results to justify how a government should (cid:133)nance a temporary increase
in government expenditures (e.g. wartime).

3 Open Economy (35 points)

Consider a world economy with two countries. The home country is characterized by:

C = c0 + c1Y

I = c2
d1 ~Y
e

X =

M
e

= d2Y

where C; Y ; ~Y ; I ; M ; X; e denote aggregate consumption, domestic output, foreign output, investment,
imports, exports and the real exchange rate, respectively. Assume c0 ; c2 > 0; 0 (cid:20) c1 (cid:20) 1; 0 (cid:20) d1 (cid:20) 1,
1 (cid:0) c1 + m > 0, 0 (cid:20) d2 (cid:20) 1.
The foreign country is characterized by

~C = ~c0 + ~c1 ~Y
~I = ~c2
fM
~e
~X =

= d1 ~Y

d2Y
~e

Assume that parameters in the foreign economy satisfy assumptions analogous to the ones for the
domestic economy.
We will assume throughout the question that the real exchange rate (e) is exogenously given.

1. [5 points] Find the equilibrium level of output in the domestic goods market as a function of
e; G; ~Y and parameters: Find the multiplier. Find equilibrium in foreign goods market as a
function of ~e; ~G; Y and parameters.

7

2. [3 points] How do net exports depend on the real exchange rate in this model?

3. [3 points ] State a condition relating e and ~e.

8

4. [6 points ] Solve for domestic output as a function of e; G; ~G and parameters.

5. [6 points ] How is domestic output a⁄ected by a real depreciation of the home goods relative
to the foreign goods? What about foreign output? Explain.

9

6. [6 points ] Suppose that each country may either "not act" or "attempt to depreciate." If a
country attempts to depreciate and the other country does not act, then the depreciation is
achieved. However, if both countries attempt to depreciate, there is no change in the real
exchange rate. Show that each country will choose to "attempt to depreciate".

7. [6 points ] In light of the previous result, interpret the following paragraph of the article
"Currency war fears after Swiss devaluation" (12th March 2009)

Analysts have warned of the emerging threat of currency wars fol lowing a Swiss market inter-
vention. The Swiss franc fel l by as much as 3.2 per cent against the euro to 1.53 - the biggest
decline since 1999 - after the country(cid:146)s central bank said it was taking deliberate measures to
weaken its currency. The move raises fears of retaliatory measures by other countries seeking
to give their exporters a competitive edge.

[Hint: if prices are sticky, the real and nominal exchange rates move together]
