2. (6 Points) When we characterize labor supply as an upward sloping relationship between hours
worked and wages, we assume that

(a) the substitution e⁄ect dominates the income e⁄ect.

(b) the income e⁄ect dominates the substitution e⁄ect.

(c) the income and the substitution e⁄ect cancel out making the relationship between hours
worked and wages unambiguous.
Remember that the budget constraint of an worker is wT = pc + wl where T
is the total number of hours available to distribute between leisure and work,
w is the hourly wage rate, p is the price of the consumption good, c id the
consumption of the consumption good, and l is hours of leisure consumed by
the agent.
Notice that an increase in the wage, w has two e⁄ects: on the one hand it
increases the left-hand side of the equation, which makes the agent consume
more c and enjoy more leisure, hence work less. On the other hand, an
increase in w makes the price of leisure more expensive, hence making leisure
decrease.
When we assume that hours worked increase with the wage we assume that
the second e⁄ect is stronger than the (cid:133)rst one, making a the correct answer.

3. (6 Points) According to the Solow growth model, which of the following statements is FALSE?

(a) A country which experiences higher population growth than another will have a lower
output per worker in steady state.

(b) Steady state consumption in a country which saves more will always be higher than steady
state consumption of a country with a lower savings rate.

(c) Capital accumulation alone can not sustain long run growth in capital per worker.

We know from the Solow model that population growth depreciates capi-
tal per worker which causes countries with high population rate to have low
levels of capital per worker. This makes the statement in a correct.
We also know that if there is no technological growth, in the long run (in stead
state) capital per worker will stop growing, which makes the statement in c
correct.
Finally notice that the statement in b is false. To see this, compare the steady
state consumption of a country with the maximum level of savings, s = 1: This
country will have a steady state level of consumption c(cid:3) equal to
c(cid:3) (s = 1) = (1 (cid:0) s)AF (k(cid:3) ; 1) = 0

2

However a country with a smaller savings rate, s < 1 will have a consumption
level of

as long as k(cid:3) > 0:

c(cid:3) = (1 (cid:0) s)AF (k(cid:3) ; 1) > 0

4. (6 Points) Consider a consumer who follows a PIH consumption rule and who is a saver in the
(cid:133)rst period (i.e., in the (cid:133)rst period he consumes less than his current income). Which of the
following statements is TRUE?

(a) An increase in the interest rate in the (cid:133)rst period will have no e⁄ect in the (cid:133)rst period(cid:146)s
consumption since current consumption only depends on current income.

(b) An increase in the interest rate will make the price of the (cid:133)rst period(cid:146)s consumption
compared to the second period(cid:146)s consumption more expensive, which means that the (cid:133)rst
period(cid:146)s consumption will decrease unambiguously.

(c) An increase in the interest rate makes the price of the (cid:133)rst period(cid:146)s consumption com-
pared to the second period(cid:146)s consumption more expensive but makes the consumer richer,
hence the e⁄ect of the (cid:133)rst period(cid:146)s consumption after an increase in the interest rate is
ambiguous.

Statement a is false because the consumption of a PIH consumer is a function
of current an future income.
Statement b is false. Notice that the budget constraint of a PIH consumer is

(1 + r)y1 + y2 = c1 (1 + r) + c2

This means that an increase in the interest rate will have two e⁄ects. The
(cid:133)rst e⁄ect is that it makes future consumption cheaper compared to current
consumption (substitution e⁄ect) which makes the current consumption de-
crease. However, there is a second e⁄ect, the increase in the interest rate
makes the agent richer (since he is a saver) making him want to consume
more in both periods. Hence the e⁄ect of an increase in the interest rate on
consumption is ambiguous.

5. (6 Points) The relationship between investment and the interest rate will be negative:

(a) Only for (cid:133)rms who (cid:133)nance investment through borrowing.

(b) Because the interest rate determines the opportunity cost of investing, and is a component
of the user cost of capital.

3

(c) Because the interest rate decreases the marginal product of capital making (cid:133)rms want to
install less capital.

Remember that the user cost of capital is pk (r + (cid:14)); where pk is the price
of capital goods, r is the real interest rate, and (cid:14) is the depreciation. The
optimal capital choice of the (cid:133)rm comes from the optimality condition

M P K = user cost of capital

where M P K is Fk (K; N ): This implies that the e⁄ect of the interest rate on
investment works through the user cost of capital.

2 Consumption with Borrowing Constraints (35 points)

Consider a PIH consumer, Anna, who receives an income of $4 when she is young and an income of
$10 when old. Anna is born with no assets, so a = 0: The real interest rate that Anna faces for
borrowing and saving is equal to r:

1. (7 points) Write down Anna(cid:146)s intertemporal budget constraint, i:e: the budget constraint that
relates Anna(cid:146)s lifetime income with Anna(cid:146)s lifetime consumption. Explain brie(cid:135)y what this
budget constraint tells us.

Anna(cid:146)s intertemporal budget constraint is

4 +

10
1 + r (cid:21) cy +

co
1 + r

This intertemporal budget constraint tells us that the lifetime present value of
Anna(cid:146)s income has to be greater or equal than the present value of Anna(cid:146)s con-
sumption.

5

2. (7 points) Assume that preferences are logarithmic, that is U (cy ; co ) = ln cy + (cid:12) ln co , where
(cid:12) 2 [0; 1]. Use Anna(cid:146)s optimality condition, co = (cid:12) (1 + r)cy ; and the budget constraint you
found in part 1 to (cid:133)nd Anna(cid:146)s consumption when young and old as a function of the discount
factor, (cid:12) ; the real interest rate, r; the income in period 1 and the income in period 2. Calculate
Anna(cid:146)s savings (or borrowing) when young. Under what condition will Anna be a borrower in
the (cid:133)rst period? Explain brie(cid:135)y how Anna(cid:146)s consumption when young di⁄ers from an agent
who follows a Keynesian consumption rule, where consumption at time t is equal to ct = 0:9Yt ;
where Yt is income at time t:

Using the optimality condition and the budget constraint we can write the Anna(cid:146)s
consumption when young as

1 + (cid:12) (cid:20)4 +
1 + r (cid:21)
10
1
1+(cid:12) of her present value life-
which implies that young Anna consumes a fraction 1
time income. This consumption is higher the the lower (cid:12) and the lower r:

cy =

Anna(cid:146)s consumption when old will be
1 + (cid:12) (cid:20)4 +
(cid:12) (1 + r)

co =

1 + r (cid:21)
10

Notice that Anna(cid:146)s savings will be

s = 4 (cid:0) cy
1
=
(1 + (cid:12) ) (1 + r)

(4(cid:12) (1 + r) (cid:0) 10)

This implies that Anna will be a borrower in the (cid:133)rst period if

which holds if

s < 0

(cid:12) (1 + r) <

5
2

6

3. (7 points) Suppose that Anna(cid:146)s income when young increases by " but her income when old
remains constant. Calculate the increase in Anna(cid:146)s consumption when young, (cid:1)cy ; and
calculate Anna(cid:146)s marginal propensity to consume when young ((cid:1)cy =(cid:1)yy ): Compare this to
the marginal propensity to consume of a Keynesian consumer and brie(cid:135)y comment on the
di⁄erential response of the two consumers to transitory shocks.

The change in Anna(cid:146)s consumption will be

(cid:1)cy =

1
1 + (cid:12)

"

which implies that her marginal propensity to consume will be

(cid:1)cy
(cid:1)yy =

1
1 + (cid:12)

Notice that the Anna(cid:146)s marginal propensity to consume will be smaller than that
of a Keynesian consumer if

(cid:12) >

1
9

Notice that the more weight Anna puts on future consumption the less she will
respond to transitory shocks when young in order to smooth consumption between
periods.

7

4. (7 points) Now suppose that Anna faces liquidity constraints, which means Anna can save but
is unable to borrow when she is young. Draw the budget constraint in the cy ; co axis. Using the
same income stream as above and setting r = 0; (cid:12) = 1, calculate Anna(cid:146)s optimal consumption
decision when young. Explain brie(cid:135)y how this compares to the consumption when Anna is
young and faces no liquidity constraints.

Anna(cid:146)s budget constraint will be the intersection of the following two restrictions

co (cid:20) 10 + (4 (cid:0) cy )
cy (cid:20) 4

Notice that Anna(cid:146)s decision if she could borrow would imply

cy = 7

This however can(cid:146)t be attained because of Anna(cid:146)s inability to borrow. This will
imply that Anna(cid:146)s consumption rule will be
cy = ( yy if yy (cid:20) yo
yy +yo
if yy > yo
2
Anna(cid:146)s problem is that expecting to be richer in the future, Anna would like to
consume more today than her current income. That is, Anna would like to be a
borrower, but she is unable to do so.

8

5. (7 points) Suppose as above that Anna faces liquidity constraints when young and her income
when young increases by " but her income when old remains constant. Calculate the increase
in Anna(cid:146)s consumption when young, (cid:1)cy and calculate Anna(cid:146)s marginal propensity to consume
when young ((cid:1)cy =(cid:1)yy ): How does Anna(cid:146)s marginal propensity to consume compares to the
marginal propensity to consume of a Keynesian consumer? Comment.

Notice now that as long as " < 6 Anna(cid:146)s liquidity constraint will still bind. This
implies that Anna(cid:146)s consumption when young will vary one to one with yy : This
implies that Anna(cid:146)s marginal propensity to consume of both permanent and tran-
sitory shocks will be 1 when " < 6: This highlights that under liquidity constraints
PIH agents behavior becomes closer to that of a Keynesian consumer.

3 Technological Change and the Labor Market (35 points)

In country B there is a (cid:133)rm that produces the unique good of the economy using the following
production function:
u (cid:17)2
Y = F (Ls ; Lu ) = (cid:16)AL1=2
s + L1=2
where A is a technological parameter; Ls is the number of hours of skilled workers the (cid:133)rm hires
monthly, and Lu is the number of hours of unskilled workers the (cid:133)rm hires monthly.
There are two groups of agents in the economy, one group is composed of skilled agents and
the other group is composed of unskilled agents. Both groups are equally sized (N S = N U = N )
and have the same preferences over consumption and leisure which are represented by the following
utility function

U (c; l) = ln c + (cid:17) ln l

where (cid:17) is a positive constant. The only source of income of the consumers is their wage income,
and the two groups of consumers only di⁄er in the wage they receive, which is wS for skilled workers
and wU for unskilled workers. The monthly time endowment of a worker is T : Both the (cid:133)rm and
the consumers are price takers, meaning they take the wages, wS ; wU ; and the price of the (cid:133)nal good,
P ; as given.

1. (3 points) Show that the production function satis(cid:133)es constant returns to scale in the two labor
types.

Notice that if we multiply the two labor types by a constant k we have that
F(kLs ; kLu ) = k (cid:16)AL1=2
u (cid:17)2
s + L1=2
hence, the production function exhibits constant returns to scale.

2. (5 points) Using the (cid:133)rm(cid:146)s optimality condition we have seen in class, and using the fact that
the marginal product of worker of type s is
u (cid:17)
(cid:16)AL1=2
s + L1=2
and the marginal product of labor of a worker of type u is
u (cid:17) ;
(cid:16)AL1=2
s + L1=2
(cid:133)nd the relative demand of skilled workers to unskilled workers (LS =LU ) as a function of the
relative wage (wS =wU ) and the technological parameter.

The maximization problem of the (cid:133)rm is

Ls ;Lu (cid:26)P (cid:16)AL1=2

and the optimal demand of the two types of labor satisfy the following two equa-
tions:
(cid:16)AL1=2
u (cid:17) = ws
s + L1=2
u (cid:17) = wu
(cid:16)AL1=2
s + L1=2
The wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers will be

3. (4 points) Using the time constraint T = n + l; where n is number of hours worked,write the
budget constraint of a consumer of type s and the budget constraint of a consumer of type u
as a function of leisure, consumption, the wage rate of the type, the price P ; and T :

The budget constraint is

T wi = P c + wi l

12

4. (5 points) Using the time constraint T = n + l; the budget constraint, and the fact the marginal
utility of consumption and the marginal utility of leisure are given by

M U (c) = 1=c

M U (l) = (cid:17)=l;

(cid:133)nd the optimal labor supply of individuals and the optimal demand of the (cid:133)nal good for
skilled and unskilled consumers.

The optimality condition for the consumer is

M U (c)=M U (l) = P =wi
P
wi

l =

c(cid:17)

Using this in the budget constraint we (cid:133)nd

c =

T wi
P (1 + (cid:17))

The leisure choice of an individual is

l =

(cid:17)
1 + (cid:17)

T

And using the time constraint this implies that the hours worked are

n =

1
1 + (cid:17)

T

13

5. (5 points) Using the labor supplies for the two groups of consumer and the relative labor
demand of the (cid:133)rm, (cid:133)nd the equilibrium relative wage (wS =wU ).

Labor supply for the skilled workers is

ns = N s

1
1 + (cid:17)

T

and the labor supply for the unskilled is

nu = N u

1
1 + (cid:17)

T

Using the equilibrium condition ni = Li we have that the wage must solve

wS =wU = A

14

6. (5 points) What is the e⁄ect of a technological increase (an increase in A) in the wage gap
between skilled and unskilled workers? Explain brie(cid:135)y what happens to the labor demand of
the two types of workers.

We can see from the equilibrium conditions that both wages must go up as A
increases. However, because the wage rate of the skilled workers goes up by more,
the relative wage goes up.

15

7. (4 points) Now imagine that as a result of a national trend, more and more people go to college
so the ratio of skilled to unskilled workers rises (a rise in N s =N u ). What will happen to the
relative wage between skilled and unskilled workers as a result of this national trend?

Notice that the relative supply increases to N s =N u : Using the relative demand
from part 2, we know that the equilibrium relative wage will be
N u (cid:19)(cid:0)1=2
= A (cid:18) N s
which implies that an increase in the ratio of skilled to unskilled workers will
decrease the relative wage.

ws
wu

16

8. (4 points) Finally assume that the current technological level, A; is endogenous and is a function
of the ratio between skilled and unskilled workers. In particular, assume A = (N s =N u )(cid:12) ; (cid:12) > 0.
What will happen to the wage ratio as a result of the national trend mentioned before?

Now the wage rate will be

ws
wu

N u (cid:19)(cid:0)1=2
= A (cid:18) N s
= (N s =N u )(cid:12)(cid:0)1=2

which means that the relative wage will increase following the increase in relative
supply if (cid:12) > 1=2:
