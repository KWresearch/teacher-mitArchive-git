1 Multiple choice (30 points)

1. (6 points) The increase in use of ATMs decreases the currency/deposit ratio (cu). According
to the Keynsian theory of sticky prices:

(a) output increases and the interest rate goes down,

(b) output increases and the interest rate goes up,

(c) output decreases and the interest rate goes up.

2. (6 points) In the standard IS-LM model, an increase in Government spending (G) without
changing taxes has

(a) a positive e⁄ect on equilibrium consumption,

(b) a negative e⁄ect on equilibrium consumption,

(c) an ambigous e⁄ect on equilibrium consumption.

3. (6 points) According to the misperception theory, an expected increase in money supply

(a) increases output and increases interest rate,

(b) increases output and decreases interest rate,

(c) has an e⁄ect on neither output nor interest rates.

4. (6 points) Consider a fractional reserve banking system with a legally required reserve-deposit
ratio of m. Suppose that an individual deposits ID dollars in one bank. Then, the economy-
wide change in total deposits

(a) will be at most ID = m;

(b) will be equal to ID = m;
(c) will be equal to m (cid:1) ID :
5. (6 points) According to the Taylor rule, a positive output gap (i.e. real GDP above potential
real GDP) will most likely result in

(a) the Fed adjusting its estimate of potential real GDP,

(b) the Fed decreasing the nominal federal funds rate,

(c) the Fed increasing the nominal federal funds rate.

1. (7 points) Explain the minimum value that the real interest rate, r , can take.

2. (7 points) Derive the IS curve.

4. (7 points) What are the equilibrium interets rate and output level in the economy? What is
the condition for the equilibrium interest rate to be positive?

3

5. (7 points) Suppose that the economy described above is going through a recession and the
government is trying to stimulate the economy. When will monetary policy be e⁄ective in
stimulating the economy? Explain why under certain conditions monetary policy fails to be
e⁄ective as a policy instrument.

3. (5 points) Take prices p as given. Consider the case in which the government introduces
a minimum nominal wage (cid:22)w = 50:Explain in words the qualitative e⁄ects of this policy on
equilibrium wages and employment as a function of p: (Hint: consider three cases p (cid:21) 5; 5
