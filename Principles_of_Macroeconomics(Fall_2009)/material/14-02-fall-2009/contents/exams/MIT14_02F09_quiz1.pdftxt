1 Multiple Choice (30 points)

Answer the following questions. You DO NOT need to justify your answer.

1. (6 Points) Consider an economy with two goods and two periods. Data are

Good 1

p1
t = 1

p1
t+1 = 1

q1
t = 1

q1
t+1 = 1:1

Good 2

p2
t = 1

p2
t+1 = 1:4

q2
t = 1

q2
t+1 = 1:3
t stands for the quantity of
t stands for the quantity of good 1 produced in period t; q2
where q1
good 2 produced in period t; p1
t stands for the price of good 1 in period t and p2
t stands for the
price of good 2 in period t:

The o¢ ce of national accounts wants to calculate the real GDP growth rate in this economy
using the chain index and they hire you to do so. What is the correct growth rate you should
report to the o¢ ce of national accounts?

(a) 19.7%

(b) 20.8%

(c) 20.1%

2. (6 Points) When we characterize labor supply as an upward sloping relationship between hours
worked and wages, we assume that

(a) the substitution e⁄ect dominates the income e⁄ect.

(b) the income e⁄ect dominates the substitution e⁄ect.

(c) the income and the substitution e⁄ect cancel out making the relationship between hours
worked and wages unambiguous.

3. (6 Points) According to the Solow growth model, which of the following statements is FALSE?

(a) A country which experiences higher population growth than another will have a lower
output per worker in steady state.

(b) Steady state consumption in a country which saves more will always be higher than steady
state consumption of a country with a lower savings rate.

(c) Capital accumulation alone can not sustain long run growth in capital per worker.

4. (6 Points) Consider a consumer who follows a PIH consumption rule and who is a saver in the
(cid:133)rst period (i.e., in the (cid:133)rst period he consumes less than his current income). Which of the
following statements is TRUE?

(a) An increase in the interest rate in the (cid:133)rst period will have no e⁄ect in the (cid:133)rst period(cid:146)s
consumption since current consumption only depends on current income.

(b) An increase in the interest rate will make the price of the (cid:133)rst period(cid:146)s consumption
compared to the second period(cid:146)s consumption more expensive, which means that the (cid:133)rst
period(cid:146)s consumption will decrease unambiguously.

(c) An increase in the interest rate makes the price of the (cid:133)rst period(cid:146)s consumption com-
pared to the second period(cid:146)s consumption more expensive but makes the consumer richer,
hence the e⁄ect of the (cid:133)rst period(cid:146)s consumption after an increase in the interest rate is
ambiguous.

5. (6 Points) The relationship between investment and the interest rate will be negative:

(a) Only for (cid:133)rms who (cid:133)nance investment through borrowing.

(b) Because the interest rate determines the opportunity cost of investing, and is a component
of the user cost of capital.

(c) Because the interest rate decreases the marginal product of capital making (cid:133)rms want to
install less capital.

2 Consumption with Borrowing Constraints (35 points)

Consider a PIH consumer, Anna, who receives an income of $4 when she is young and an income of
$10 when old. Anna is born with no assets, so a = 0: The real interest rate that Anna faces for
borrowing and saving is equal to r:

1. (7 points) Write down Anna(cid:146)s intertemporal budget constraint, i:e: the budget constraint that
relates Anna(cid:146)s lifetime income with Anna(cid:146)s lifetime consumption. Explain brie(cid:135)y what this
budget constraint tells us.

3

2. (7 points) Assume that preferences are logarithmic, that is U (cy ; co ) = ln cy + (cid:12) ln co , where
(cid:12) 2 [0; 1]. Use Anna(cid:146)s optimality condition, co = (cid:12) (1 + r)cy ; and the budget constraint you
found in part 1 to (cid:133)nd Anna(cid:146)s consumption when young and old as a function of the discount
factor, (cid:12) ; the real interest rate, r; the income in period 1 and the income in period 2. Calculate
Anna(cid:146)s savings (or borrowing) when young. Under what condition will Anna be a borrower in
the (cid:133)rst period? Explain brie(cid:135)y how Anna(cid:146)s consumption when young di⁄ers from an agent
who follows a Keynesian consumption rule, where consumption at time t is equal to ct = 0:9Yt ;
where Yt is income at time t:

4

3. (7 points) Suppose that Anna(cid:146)s income when young increases by " but her income when old
remains constant. Calculate the increase in Anna(cid:146)s consumption when young, (cid:1)cy ; and
calculate Anna(cid:146)s marginal propensity to consume when young ((cid:1)cy =(cid:1)yy ): Compare this to
the marginal propensity to consume of a Keynesian consumer and brie(cid:135)y comment on the
di⁄erential response of the two consumers to transitory shocks.

5

4. (7 points) Now suppose that Anna faces liquidity constraints, which means Anna can save but
is unable to borrow when she is young. Draw the budget constraint in the cy ; co axis. Using the
same income stream as above and setting r = 0; (cid:12) = 1, calculate Anna(cid:146)s optimal consumption
decision when young. Explain brie(cid:135)y how this compares to the consumption when Anna is
young and faces no liquidity constraints.

6

5. (7 points) Suppose as above that Anna faces liquidity constraints when young and her income
when young increases by " but her income when old remains constant. Calculate the increase
in Anna(cid:146)s consumption when young, (cid:1)cy and calculate Anna(cid:146)s marginal propensity to consume
when young ((cid:1)cy =(cid:1)yy ): How does Anna(cid:146)s marginal propensity to consume compares to the
marginal propensity to consume of a Keynesian consumer? Comment.

3 Technological Change and the Labor Market (35 points)

In country B there is a (cid:133)rm that produces the unique good of the economy using the following
production function:
u (cid:17)2
Y = F (Ls ; Lu ) = (cid:16)AL1=2
s + L1=2
where A is a technological parameter; Ls is the number of hours of skilled workers the (cid:133)rm hires
monthly, and Lu is the number of hours of unskilled workers the (cid:133)rm hires monthly.
There are two groups of agents in the economy, one group is composed of skilled agents and
the other group is composed of unskilled agents. Both groups are equally sized (N S = N U = N )
and have the same preferences over consumption and leisure which are represented by the following
utility function

U (c; l) = ln c + (cid:17) ln l

where (cid:17) is a positive constant. The only source of income of the consumers is their wage income,
and the two groups of consumers only di⁄er in the wage they receive, which is wS for skilled workers
and wU for unskilled workers. The monthly time endowment of a worker is T : Both the (cid:133)rm and
the consumers are price takers, meaning they take the wages, wS ; wU ; and the price of the (cid:133)nal good,
P ; as given.

1. (3 points) Show that the production function satis(cid:133)es constant returns to scale in the two labor
types.

AL(cid:0)1=2
s

2. (5 points) Using the (cid:133)rm(cid:146)s optimality condition we have seen in class, and using the fact that
the marginal product of worker of type s is
u (cid:17)
(cid:16)AL1=2
s + L1=2
and the marginal product of labor of a worker of type u is
u (cid:17) ;
(cid:16)AL1=2
s + L1=2
(cid:133)nd the relative demand of skilled workers to unskilled workers (LS =LU ) as a function of the
relative wage (wS =wU ) and the technological parameter.

L(cid:0)1=2
u

3. (4 points) Using the time constraint T = n + l; where n is number of hours worked,write the
budget constraint of a consumer of type s and the budget constraint of a consumer of type u
as a function of leisure, consumption, the wage rate of the type, the price P ; and T :

10

4. (5 points) Using the time constraint T = n + l; the budget constraint, and the fact the marginal
utility of consumption and the marginal utility of leisure are given by

M U (c) = 1=c

M U (l) = (cid:17)=l;

(cid:133)nd the optimal labor supply of individuals and the optimal demand of the (cid:133)nal good for
skilled and unskilled consumers.

11

5. (5 points) Using the labor supplies for the two groups of consumer and the relative labor
demand of the (cid:133)rm, (cid:133)nd the equilibrium relative wage (wS =wU ).

12

6. (5 points) What is the e⁄ect of a technological increase (an increase in A) in the wage gap
between skilled and unskilled workers? Explain brie(cid:135)y what happens to the labor demand of
the two types of workers.

13

7. (4 points) Now imagine that as a result of a national trend, more and more people go to college
so the ratio of skilled to unskilled workers rises (a rise in N s =N u ). What will happen to the
relative wage between skilled and unskilled workers as a result of this national trend?

14

8. (4 points) Finally assume that the current technological level, A; is endogenous and is a function
of the ratio between skilled and unskilled workers. In particular, assume A = (N s =N u )(cid:12) ; (cid:12) > 0.
What will happen to the wage ratio as a result of the national trend mentioned before?
