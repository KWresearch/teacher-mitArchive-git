to fall, and hence from the equilibrium in the good market, I and C rise! 

•  Prices affect the demand side of the economyy throu ggh interest rates. 

•  Recall: prices do not affect C (if wages change 1 for 1 with prices PVLR will not change!)   

The AD curve comes directly from the IS-LM equilibrium.  So, in essence, the AD curve 
is a representation of BOTH the IS curve AND the LM curve.

What Shifts the AD curve? 
•  As the IS, the AD curve represents the demand side of the economy:  Y = C+I+G+NX 

• Anyythingg that causes the IS curve to shift to the rigght cause the AD curve to shift to the rigght 

•  Anything that causes the LM curve to shift to the right (except price changes) causes the AD 
curve to shift to the right. 

Example:  Nominal money (M) increases,  r will fall, I will increase, AD will shift right. 

     
With increase in money: 	 LM shifts right 
Move along the IS curve 
Interest rates fall 
C and I increase 
AD shifts right. 

A change in prices cause the LM to shift, but cause only a movement along the AD curve.

change their behavior. 

The Equilibrium is not constant:  Changes to A, K and N* change Y*, and 
hence shift the LRAS.  Y* trends upward in most countries (because A and K 
and population grow over time - shifting out N*).  Many economists believe its 
 
growth rate is fairly stable.

Long-run Equilibrium 

Equilibrium is a point of attraction for the economy: 
Most macroeconomists believe that, in the absence of shocks, the economy 
 
would reach equilibrium after perhaps 5 years.  Thus the economy is in

i
equilibrium in the “long run” (after 5 years).  

Is the economy ever in long run equilibrium? 
Given that shocks are always hitting, the economy is not likely to be in long 
run equilibrium at any point in time.  Yet the force of attraction of 
equilibrium keeps the economy hovering around the equilibrium. 

Whyy is the lon gg run eqquilibrium ppoint attractive? 
Because at this point the labor market clears.  Away from Y* workers are 
not on their labor supply curve (and firms may be off their labor demand 
curve)).  Maximizingg behavior b yy workers and firms  ppush the economyy 
 
towards long run equilibrium.  Shocks push the economy away 
 
temporarily.

Aggregate Supply: Short Run versus Long Run 

1)	
 Long Run: labor market is in equilibrium ,N=N* 

2)	 Short Run: labor market is not in equilibrium: cyclical unemployment may 
occur (N adjusts, but it need not be at N*, K is fixed) 

 Version 1: Firms cannot adjust prices nor wages, that is, all prices are
1.	
“sticky”! 
Firms are always willing to produce extra output to meet the increased demand 

2.  Version 2: nominal wages are “sticky”. Then W is fixed, but not W/P! 
Firms can change somehow prices in the short run in reaction to changes in 
demand, but cannot change wages 

13 

SRAS: Version 1 
Some Macro  Economists  believe  that  prices  are  fixed  in  the  short  run. It
• 
is  costly  to  keep  changing  your  prices when  faced with  every  given  shock.  As  a 
result, prices in the market tend to change slowly (price of milk at Dominick’s!) 

 

Firms  keep  prices  and  wages  fixed  and  just meet  demand  by  requiring 
• 
workers  to work a  little harder sometimes and a  little  less hard during other 
times.  This is how they meet changes in demand without changing prices.

SRAS: Version 2 

•  The Short Run Aggregate Supply Curve (the relationship between output 
and prices) in the short run is positive 
SRAS is upward sloping! 
      

If there is a positive demand shock, firms may chose to produce more (at a 
• 
given fixed nominal wage) to satisfy demand.  To take advantage of the higher 
 
demand, firms may raise prices (optimally) which drives down W/P.  The lower 
 
real wages causes firms to optimally hire more labor - causing output to increase. 

 
•  However, Nd  has not shifted!  Firms decide to meet the increase in demand 
for their product by hiring more workers because of the lower short run real wage. 
Firms remain on their labor demand curve, while workers are off their labor 
supply curve temporarily (workers have little bargaining power, options in the 
short run). 

• 

there is disequilibrium in the labor market!

Notes on SRAS (Version 2) 

If  firms get a positive demand  shock  (demand  for goods  increase),  firms will

raise  prices,  but  wages  stay  fixed.  Hence  real wages  will  decline making  firms

What Shifts the SRAS 
We  will  work  with  both  the  horizontal  (Version  1)  and  the  upward  sloping 
(Version 2)  SRAS curves. 

What Shifts any SRAS curve? 

SRAS = F(A, K, N, raw  materials).  

•  K is fixed 
•  an increase in A shifts the SRAS down 
•   an increase in price  of  raw materials  shifts  the SRAS up. For given  labor and 
capital,, if the pp crice of raw materials get more ee pxpensive,, firms will pproduce less

The Self Correcting Mechanism 

•  When the economy is in disequilibrium for a while (Y not equal Y*), the economy will
naturally move towards Y*. 

•  Reason:  Labor market will  eventually  clear.  The  reason  that Y  does  not  equal Y*
is because N does not equal N*.  As soon as the labor market clears, we will be back at N*.

But, as W increases, the short run AS will shift in (higher cost of production). 

The exact opposite will work when N < N*. 

As the labor market starts to clear  the SRAS will adjust to bring us back to Y*.
