Goods Market 
•  IS curve represents the equilibrium in the goods market: 

(1) 
(1) 

Y = C + I + G + NX  
 
     
 
 
 
   
 
= 
Y 
C + I + G + NX

•  Recall the definition of private savings S (hh) = Y – T – C 

•  Recall the definition of national savings S = S (hh) + T – G 
 

•  Combining them 

(2)  

S = Y – C – G  
 

•  F

From (1) and (2) the demand side of the economy can be written as: 
b 
 
d  id 
(1)  d (2) th  d 
f th 
 
 

S = I + NX 

The IS curve is named as it is because it documents the relationship between Investment

and Saving (holding NX constant).

Demand side : the IS curve 

C	
 is a function of PVLR (Y, Yf, W), tax policy, expectations, etc. 

I 

is a function of r, Af, K, and investment tax policy. 

G	
 
y (we will discuss this shortly)
 is a function of ggovernment policy
 
 
p
(
 
y)

 

NX  we will model in the last lecture of the course (for the U.S., NX is small) 

  The IS curve relates Y to r.  How do interest rates affect Y? 
•	
 

•	
  As r falls, Investment increases (due to firm profit maximization behavior). 

•	
  Also Consumpption increases ((substitution effect dominates)) 

IS curve is downward sloping in {r, Y} space.

Suppose r is set by the Fed at the level of r* (we will explore this in depth later in the course).  
For a given r, we can solve for the level of output desired by the demand side of the economy.

What shifts the IS curve 

What shifts the IS curve to the right? 

Anything that increases C, I or G  (or NX when we model it): 

• higgher exppected income or wealth  
ggher C 
       
higgher PVLR 
• higher conusmer confidence            higher PVLR         higher C 
hi
• higher Tr or lower T (if the Ricardian equivalence fails)        higher C 
•• higher expectations about Af 
higher MPKf 
 
 
 
 
 
higher expectations about A 
higher MPK 
higher I
higher I 
• higher business confidence          higher MPKf 
higher I 
• lower δ or mm, or lower tK 
lower adjusted user cost of K         higher I 
• higher G 

Changges in r WILL NOT cause IS curve to shift 
(causes movement along IS curve)

The Money Market is in Equilibrium when 

Ms/P = Ld(Y, r + πe) 

Ms/P = Real Money Supply 

L (Y  r + πe) =  Real Money Demand
Ld(Y, r + πe) Real Money Demand 
 
 
 
 

The money supply is decided by the Fed and does not change with interest rates 

What shifts real money supply:  M, P 
What shifts real money demand:  Y, πe 

LM curve is named as it is because it documents the relationship between Liquidity and
Money

What shifts the LM Curve 

LM Curve: represents the relationship of Y and r through the money market 

As Y increases - Ld  shifts upwards - causing real interest rates to rise (increase in 
transactions demand increases the demand for money).  

What shifts the LM curve to the right? 

• Higher nominal money supply           higher Ms/P 

• Lower pprices

Summing Up 

1)  MARKET I : GOODS MARKET 

• goods demand = C + I + G (+NX) = Y = goods supply (set by maximizing firms) 
• as the interest rate increases, I and C fall and the demand for goods falls 
• IS curve is downward slopingp g  

2)  MARKET II : MONEY MARKET 

• money demand = Ld(Y, r + πe) = Ms/P = money supply (set by the Fed) 
•	
 as output increases, money demand increases and the interest rate has to increase 
to bringg the demand back to the su pppp
lyy 
 
• LM curve is upward sloping

Short Run 

  SHORT RUN: equilibrium given by intersection of IS and LM 
•	

  When aggregate demand for goods rises, assume that firms are willing 
•	
to hire more workers  in the short run to produce the extra output and 
 
meet the exppanded demand 

  LONG RUN: also labor market is in equilibrium and full employment: 
•	
Y* = f((N*,K,A)
 
,
,
)
 

•	
  In the long run, if there is higher demand, firms will increase prices 
until theyy  hire the opptimal amount of workers and pproduce the ppotential 
level of output.

Anything that affects the labor market will affect Y*! 

If N* increases, Y* will shift to the right. 

If N* decreases, Y* will shift to the left. 

For example, Y* will shift right if:

A iA increases 
K increases 
population increases 
labor income taxes fall (and income effect is small relative to substitution effect)

Long Run 

•	
  The short run equilibrium is an equilibrium in the sense that the 
aggregate quantity of goods produced is equal to the quantity 
demanded 

  It is not an equilibrium in the sense that to meet the aggregate 
•	
demand of ggoods,, firms have to pproduce more ((or less)) out pput than 
their potential level Y*! 

•	
  Y* is the level of output that maximizes firms’ profits. Hence, firms are 
producing more (or less) than what they would like. 

  This will induce at some point firms to change prices. If M
