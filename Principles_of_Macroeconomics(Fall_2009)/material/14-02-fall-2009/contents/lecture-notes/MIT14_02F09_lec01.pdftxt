What is a Recession? 

  “Official Rule of Thumb” - 2 or more quarters of negative real GDP growth 
•	
NOT NECESSARY THE CASE! 

•	  Most Economies are usually not in recession 

–	
 U.S. average postwar expansion:  50 months 

–	
 U.S. average postwar recession:  11 months 
   

 The 1990s experienced the longest expansion since 1850 (the second longest was 106 months ; 
–	
1961
1961-1969)
1969) 

  Great Moderation: after the mid-’80s, expansions have become more stable and
•	
recessions less frequent and less severe 

•	  What about the current recession? Is the Great Moderation ended?
