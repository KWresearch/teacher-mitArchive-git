An Introduction to Consumption

a = ‘subsistence’ level of Consumption
b = marginal propensity to consume = MPC

 MPC

Key: Consumption is based solely on current income.

• Based on cross-country and long run time series data: a ~ 0 , MPC = ΔC/ ΔY ~ 0.90

•

•

Problem:  In Micro Data (household data) over short term, MPC << 0.90
(
)
,

People run a regression: ΔC = β0 + β1 ΔY + error. With household data β1 around 0.40!

• Keynesian consumption function does not seem to match short run (household) 
data, although it does match long run (country level) data.

What is missing?

• Drawbacks to Keynesian Consumption Functions (aside from not matching 
data):)

– Does not Include Expectations <<this is important!>>
– Does not Distinguish Between Different Types of Income Changes (one-time
Does not Distinguish Between Different Types of Income Changes (one-time 
increase vs. permanent increase)
– Does not allow for the role of interest rates
– Does not result from optimizing household behavior

Is there another theory which allows us to look at household Consumption 
Behavior?
Behavior?

• Yes  - Lifecycle/Permanent Income Hypothesis!

Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH)

Milton Friedman/Franco Modigliani:

– Consumers like Smooth Consumption
Consumers like Smooth Consumption

– Optimize ‘lifetime’ utility (over consumption and leisure)

Today, you plan your consumption based upon what you observe today and 
what you expect to happen tomorrow!

– People like to smooth ‘marginal utility’ across seasons, business cycles and 
life cycles.

– Think about it:  Retirement, Job Loss, Summer Vacations, etc.

– Does much better at matching data – (although not perfect)

7

Model Set-Up

•

Assumptions:

1. Time horizon = 2 periods (think at working age and retirement)

2. Current income, future income, and wealth are given

3. Agents can borrow and lend at the same given real interest rate r

•

Notation:
Notation:

y = current real income
yf = future real income
y
a = real assets (wealth) at the beginning of the current period
c = current real consumption
cf = future real consumption

•

Question: How c and cf are chosen?

8

The Budget Constraint

• How much the consumer can afford?

For gi en reso rces c rrent cons mption affects f t re cons mption!
• For given resources, current consumption affects future consumption!

• Current resources: y + a

• Leftover after consumption: y + a – c 

• Total resources in the future: (y + a – c)*(1 + r) + yf
)
)*(1
(
h f
i
l
f

• The future period is the last period, then consume all resources! 

cf = (y + a – c)*(1 + r) + yf

• This is the budget constraint = combination of current and future consumption 
that the agent can afford for given current, future income and wealth

c

Downward sloping: trade-off between current and future c

Slope = 1 + r (1 unit increase in consumption reduces savings by 1 unit and
Slope 
 1 + r  (1 unit increase in consumption, reduces savings by 1 unit and 
hence future consumption by 1 + r units !)

10

In terms of present value …

The present value measures the payment to be made in the future in terms of 
today dollars. It depends on the interest rate!

If you have to pay $110 tomorrow and the interest rate is 10%, then 
you have to save $100 today! The present value of x is x / (1 + i)

If payments are measured in nominal terms you use the nominal interest rate i, 
if in real terms (as in our model) then you use r!

PVLR = present value of lifetime resources PVLC = present value of lifetime
PVLR = present value of lifetime resources, PVLC = present value of lifetime 
consumption

PVLR = a + y + yf /(1+r)

PVLC =  c + cf /(1+r)

Consumer Preferences

•

•

Given the available combinations of current and future consumption, what is 
the one preferred b the agent?
the one preferred by the agent?

Utility describes the satisfaction of an agent!

U(c , cf) represents the utility Veronica gets from consuming c units of current 
consumption and cf units of future consumption

For simplicity forget about leisure!

Indifferences curves = graphical representation of all the combinations of 
current and future consumption that yield the same utility level

An Example (continued)
• Maximize Utility. We get

∂U(c)/∂c

∂U(c)/∂c =  (1/c) - β (1+r) (1/cf) = 0
(1/c) β (1+r) (1/c )

<<Process:  

a) Use budget constraint and substitute out cf from utility function (utility 
function is only a function of c now (not c and cf).
b) Take derivative of utility function with respect to c 
c)  Set derivative equal to zero (this is how we maximize!)
d)  Substitute cf  back into the second term using the budget constraint. >>

Unexpected One Time Increase in Wealth

• Suppose today I find out that my wealth increased by $2 prior to period 1 (a 
one time unexpected stock market gain) What is the new consumption plan
one-time unexpected stock market gain).  What is the new consumption plan 
associated with this unexpected increase in a?

•

•

c = cf = 6
6

s1 = -5 (y – c),  s2 = 3 (increase in PVLR due to wealth = 2)

• Consumption increases today (and in future), and saving falls.

• One time increases in wealth are identical to one time (transitory) changes in 
income.

26

Some Evidence Consistent with PIH Behavior

• Business Cycles are likely to be associated with temporary shocks to income. 

– We find consumption to be more stable than income over the business cycle.
– And the saving rate is procyclical.

• Micro studies find the MPC out of income changes to be much less than 0.9
(C does not track Y one for one)

• Micro Studies find a MPC out of changes in wealth of about 0.05.  
(Unexpected capital gains in housing/securities are like one time increases in 
income).

• Household consumption responds more to permanent shocks to income

27

However……

If the PIH theory is true, consumption of the economy should not respond
that much during recessions

Why?

1.

recessions have little effect on our lifetime incomes

2. we should prepare for recessions and as a result, have savings to
2. we should prepare for recessions and as a result, have savings to

Refinements to Consumption Theory

• These are refinements to consumption theory that we will not spend much 
time on (there is a lot of active research on that)

– Liquidity Constraints  << borrowing constraints - maybe cannot 
smooth income!!!!!!!!!!!>>

– Uncertainty (Precautionary Savings)
Uncertainty (Precautionary Savings)
– Little is known about preferences (time preference rates - β and risk 
aversion).
– Bequests explain a large portion of wealth accumulation
– Portfolio Choice makes a difference
– Large variation in wealth accumulations across individuals (we will 
discuss this more).
– Life Cycle Shocks.
Lif C l Sh k
– Home production (including shopping for bargains)

30

Liquidity Constraints

• Liquidity Constraints refer to the fact that sometimes a household (or a 
firm) optimally wants to borrow to smooth consumption (or for 
) p
y
p
(
investment), but lenders are unwilling to lend to that household.

– Why will lenders refuse to lend?  Lender may be afraid of default.

•

In recessions, in order to smooth consumption, households who receive a negative 
income shock either have to draw down savings or borrow.  If they are prevented 
from borrowing, household will have no choice but to cut their consumption. As a
from borrowing, household will have no choice but to cut their consumption.  As a 
result, C will fall during recessions.

• Liquidity constraints make households look Keynesian when income falls (C falls 
when Y falls – for those with no savings and who cannot borrow).

• However, when Y is high, households look like PIH households – nothing prevents 
them from saving.  If Y is temporarily high, households would want to save some of

that income.  Liquidity constraints prevent borrowing NOT saving…….

Consumption and Interest Rates

•

•

•

The real interest rate affects the consumption/saving decision

The price of current consumption in terms of future consumption is 
1 + r

If you increase consumption today by 1 unit you are saving 1 unit less and 
you will be consuming 1 + r units less in the future!

Increase in Interest Rates

Substitution effect:
Higher r lowers C.  Think of people saving more to reap the higher return, or people 
borrowing less b/c it is more expensive.  Higher interest rate today, makes saving 
more beneficial (price of future consumption falls). Households will switch away
more beneficial (price of future consumption falls). Households will  switch away 
from consumption today (i.e., C today falls, C tomorrow increases, and S today 
increases)

consumption tomorrow.  As a result, you can save less and get more of both.  
(C today increases, C tomorrow increases, and S today falls) 

Net Borrowers: they have to pay higher interest payments! They are poorer. 
Then C today will fall C tomorrow will fall and S today will increase
Then  C today will fall, C tomorrow will fall and S today will increase.

Consumption and Income Taxes

Assume households maximize U(C, L), where C is consumption and L is the fraction of
time spent on leisure. Households are happier by consuming more and working less.

The budget constraint has to hold:

(1)

PC * C = W * (1 – t) * (1 – L),

where (1-L) is the fraction of time worked, t is the income tax rate and W is the Wage.

The foc is:
The foc is:

(2) MUL / MUC = PL / PC, 

h MU
d P / P W(1 t)/P
where MU = marginal utility and PL / PC =W(1-t)/P
tilit

i

This is the equilibrium condition for all utility optimization over two goods.

37

Consumption and Income Taxes (continued)
Suppose income taxes fall. What happens to consumption and leisure?

Income Effect (Equation 1)

When income taxes fall – all else equal, households will be richer [i.e., W(1-t) will increase].
When households are richer, they will buy more of the things they like, that is, both C and L.

So, according to income effect, C and L will increase when income taxes fall.

Substitution Effect (Equation 2)

When income taxes fall, all else equal, after tax wages will increase [i.e., W(1-t) will increase].
As the price of leisure increases, MUL must increase AND/OR MUC must fall.  
As L falls MU increases (law of diminishing marginal utility of L) As C increases MU must fall
As L falls, MUL increases (law of diminishing marginal utility of L). As C increases, MUL must fall

So, according to substitution effect, C will increase and L will fall when income taxes fall.

Putting two effects together:   Effect on L is ambiguous.    C will definitely increase!

Some Caveats

Investment takes time to plan.

Investment tends to be ‘irreversible’ (costly to change if you over invest).
(
y
g
y
)

Firms - like individuals - are forward looking.  If interest rates fall today, I may not 
invest today because I believe interest rates can be even lower tomorrow.

Investment returns are uncertain (returns are in the future - which is unknown).
As economic uncertainty increases, investment decisions can become delayed.  

Firms, like individuals, may be financially constrained.  
The role of banks in the economy may be important.  Financial constraints means 
that it is costly to access external finance.

Current Recession

Other components of Investment

•

So far, focus on business fixed investment (I by firms in structure,
equipment and software)

• Other 2 components of Investment:

1. Inventory Investment = increase in firms’ inventories of unsold goods,

Same concepts of future marginal product and user cost of capital apply!

• Example: apartment building
Future marginal product = real values of rents – taxes and operating costs

Part III: Goods Market

Supply and Demand of Goods

• C

I 

• G

is a function of PVLR (Y, Yf, W), taxes, expectations, liquidity constraints…

is a function of r, d, Af, K, expectations, investment taxes…

is government spending (we will discuss fiscal policy later in the class)

• NX we will model this at the end of the course (for the U.S., NX is small)

• We are moving towards a model of Goods Aggregate Demand:

C(.) + I(.) + G + NX

(We will get to NX later in the course)

•

In the previous lectures we have studied the Goods Aggregate Supply:
In the previous lectures we have studied the Goods Aggregate Supply:

Y = AF(K,N)

Goods Market

• The Good Market is in equilibrium when the quantity of goods supplied is 
equal to the quantity of goods demanded:

(1)

Y = C + I + G + NX

• For the moment assume there is no other country and NX = 0

• Recall the definition of national savings:

(2)
(2)

S Y C G
S = Y – C – G 

• From (1) and (2) the equilibrium in the goods market can be represented by:

S = I

• The interest rate will adjust to bring the market in equilibrium!
