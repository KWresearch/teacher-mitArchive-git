The forms of money have been very different: from shells to gold to cigarettes!

• Most prices are measured in units of money → understanding the role of money is 
important to understand inflation

• Many economists believe that money has also impact on real variables (we will talk 
about that!)

3 Functions of Money

1. Medium of exchange: Money permits to trade at less cost in time and effort!

Barter is inefficient because is difficult and time-consuming to find the 
trading partner.
Other benefit: allows specialization (and rises productivity)

to express economic value in terms of money

Caveat: In countries with volatile inflation, money is a poor unit of account 
because prices must be changed frequently. More stable units of account used 
(dollars or gold), even if transactions use local currency.

3. Store of Value: money is a way of storing wealth.

Measures of Money

•

•

•

The distinction between monetary and non-monetary assets is controversial.

Example: MMMFs (money market mutual funds) are organizations that sell 
shares to the public and invest in short-term gov and corporate debt. Low 
return and allow for checks (with fee)…Are they Money?

There are two main official measures of money stock, called monetary 
aggregates:

1. M1: the most narrow definition, includes mainly currencies and balances 
held in checking accounts.
g

2. M2: includes everything in M1 plus less “moneylike” components: saving 
deposits, small time deposits, MMMFa, MMDAs (money market deposit
deposits, small time deposits, MMMFa, MMDAs (money market deposit 
accounts).

Money Supply

• Money supply is the amount of money available in an economy

•

In modern economies, money supply is affected by:

1. The Central Bank (the Federal Reserve System in the United States) is 
(
y
)
the government institution responsible for monetary policies

2. Depositary Institutions (Banks) are privately owned banks and thrift
2. Depositary Institutions (Banks) are privately owned banks and thrift 
institutions that accept deposits from and make loans directly to the public

3 The public includes every person or firm (except banks) that holds money
3. The public includes every person or firm (except banks) that holds money 
in currency or deposits.

The Fed
• Federal funds are the deposits of private banks with the Fed.

• The federal funds market consists of private banks borrowing and lending their 
federal funds amongst each other overnight.

• The federal funds rate is the interest rate on these overnight loans. It is set by 
supply and demand not by the Fed
supply and demand, not by the Fed.

• The Fed can change the supply of federal funds through open market

operations, exerting a powerful indirect effect on the fed funds rate.

• The Fed targets the federal funds rate and carries out open market operations to 
keep the actual rate near the target rate.

7

What are Open Market Operations?

Open market operations  =  Central Bank purchases and sales of government 
securities on the open market.

Open market purchase (sale)  = Central Bank purchases (sells) government 
securities.  The seller (buyer) receives (uses) federal funds as payment.

Back to Money Supply

• For now, assume that the Money Supply is purely affected by the Fed

• Standard Monetary policy = Open Market Operations

•

If the Fed conducts an Open Market Purchase = inject Money in the system!

• Money Supply increases
• Money Supply increases

•

In a few lectures, we will see that the Money Supply is also affected by Banks and 
households…

Money Demand

•

•

Agents decide how much wealth to keep as money:  Portfolio allocation decision

4 main characteristics of assets matter:

1. Expected Return: the higher the expected return the higher consumption the
1. Expected Return: the higher the expected return the higher consumption the 
agent can enjoy!

2. Risk: agents are risk-averse, hence to hold a risky asset, it must have a higher 
expected return

3. Liquidity: the easier is to exchange the asset for goods, services or other assets, 
the more attractive is the asset. Money is highly liquid!
the more attractive is the asset. Money is highly liquid!

Money is the most liquid BUT has a low return!

Money Demand (continued)

• Nominal money demand is proportional to the price level. For example, if prices go up    
b 10% th
by 10% then individuals need 10% more money for transactions.
i di id l
d 10%
f
t

• As Y increases, desired consumption increases and so individuals need more money for 
the increased number of desired transactions This is the liquidity demand for money
the increased number of desired transactions. This is the liquidity demand for money. 

• As the nominal interest rate on non-money assets (bonds), i, increases the opportunity 
cost of holding money increases and so the demand for nominal money balances
cost of holding money increases and so the demand for nominal money balances 
decreases. 

• Since i = r + πe, we can decompose the effects on an increase in i into real interest rate 
,
p
increases (holding expected inflation fixed) and expected inflation increases (holding the 
real interest rate fixed).

Money Demand Function

Our model for the demand for nominal money balances takes the following form

Md = P·Ld(Y, i)

where 

Md = demand for nominal money balances (demand for M1) 

Ld = demand for liquidity function 

P = aggregate price level (CPI or GDP deflator) 

Y = real income (real GDP) 

i = nominal interest rate on non-money assets 

13

Real Money Balances

The demand for real balances

Since the demand for nominal balances is proportional to the aggregate price level, we can 
divide both sides of the nominal money demand equation by P. 

This gives the liquidity demand function or the demand for real balances function: 

Md/P = Ld(Y, r + πe)

The left-hand-side of the above equation is the demand for nominal balances divided by 
the aggregate price level or the demand for real balances (the real purchasing power of 
money). 
)

The right-hand side is the liquidity demand function. The demand for real balances is 
decomposed into a transactions demand for money (captured by Y) and a portfolio demand
decomposed into a transactions demand for money (captured by Y) and a portfolio demand 
for money (captured by r and πe).

Money Market

The Money Market is in Equilibrium when

Real Money Demand = Real Money Supply

where  Real Money Supply = Ms/P
Real Money Demand = Md/P = Ld(Y, r + πe)

Note:  The money supply curve does not change with interest rates (it is verticle)

What shifts real money supply:  M, P
What shifts real money demand:  Y, πe

The Quantity Theory

Definition: V = velocity = PY/M 

M/ P =k*Y

M = money supply, P = the GDP deflator, Y = real GDP

Quantity theory: k is constant and hence V=k is constant!
Quantity theory: k is constant and hence V k is constant!

However, it seems that V is not so constant over time…

Money Growth and Inflation
If in equilibrium demand = supply, then if Central Bank doubles M, the result is a 
doubling of P

Inflation is caused by too much money chasing too few goods i e by M rising
Inflation is caused by too much money chasing too few goods, i.e. by M rising 
relative to Y (controlling for how much M we need to transact PY, which is V).

• Note inflation could rise despite fixed M because of falling Y or rising V Across
• Note inflation could rise despite fixed M because of falling Y or rising V. Across 
countries, however, most differences in inflation are associated with differences in 
M growth: correlation between M growth and inflation is above .95.

Money Growth and Inflation

•
V is not fixed in reality.  V rises with financial innovation and with i (the 
nominal interest rate)
nominal interest rate). 

• Recall that i =  r +π. For given r, then higher inflation translates one-for-one 
into higher i.  Implication:  V rises with the rate of inflation.

p

•
Thus taking into account that V is not fixed only makes the channel from M 
growth to P growth stronger

• When M growth is high it generates inflation , which raises V, which in 
turn raises inflation further.  This is a big deal in hyperinflations.

Hyperinflations are ...

usually characterized by accelerating inflation (wage indexation)

caused by rapid M growth (the Central Bank creating new reserves at a rapid rate)
