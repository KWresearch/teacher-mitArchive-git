Bank Runs

Fall 2009

1 Bank runs

(cid:15) Diamond and Dybvig (1983)

(cid:15) Three periods T = 0; 1; 2

(cid:15) Continuum of agents

(cid:15) Preferences

u (c1 + (cid:17)c2)

where (cid:17) idiosyncratic shock
(cid:17) = ( 0
with probability (cid:28)
1 with probability 1 (cid:0) (cid:28)

((cid:147)early consumer(cid:148))
((cid:147)late consumer(cid:148))

(cid:15) Agents have an endowment normalized to 1

(cid:15) At time 0, each agent invests without knowing his shock (cid:17)

(cid:15) No aggregate uncertainty: exactly (cid:28) fraction of agents will have (cid:17) = 0

(cid:15) Technology: if an agent invests 1 at time 0, he can get:
1. x if he chooses to liquidate a fraction x at time 1

2. R (1 (cid:0) x) (cid:21) (1 (cid:0) x) if he liquidates 1 (cid:0) x at time 2

Autarky:

(cid:15) single agent will choose how much to consume in two periods
max
E [u (c1 ((cid:17)) + (cid:17)c2 ((cid:17)))]
x;c1 ;c2
c1 ((cid:17)) (cid:20) x
c2 ((cid:17)) (cid:20) R (1 (cid:0) x)

(cid:15) optimal to choose

c1 (1) = 0; c2 (1) = R
c1 (0) = 1; c2 (0) = 0

Banks:

(cid:15) risk sharing arrangement
max

E [u (c1 ((cid:17)) + (cid:17)c2 ((cid:17)))]
E [c1 ((cid:17))] (cid:20) x
E [c2 ((cid:17))] (cid:20) R (1 (cid:0) x)

(cid:15) optimal

and

c1 (1) = 0; c2 (0) = 0

u0 (c1 (0)) = Ru0 (c2 (1))

Assumptions

(cid:15) Assumption 1: high coe¢ cient of relative risk aversion

(cid:15) Assumption 2: avoiding liquidation is more pro(cid:133)table
R > 1

Optimal liquidation policy

(cid:15) use C1 for c1 (0) and C2 for c2 (1)

(cid:15) resource constraint at time 2 imposes
(1 (cid:0) (cid:28) C1) R = (1 (cid:0) (cid:28) ) C2

(cid:15) (cid:133)nd C1 s.t.

u0 (C1) = Ru0 (cid:18)R
(cid:15) Result: under A1 and A2

1 (cid:0) (cid:28) (cid:19)
1 (cid:0) (cid:28) C1

1 < C1 < C2 < R

(cid:15) Some, but not complete, insurance for the early consumers

(cid:15) ! autarky is suboptimal

(cid:15) check that A2 is needed: with u (c) = log c, then C1 = 1 and C2 = R
works
1 = R (cid:18)R
1 (cid:0) (cid:28) (cid:19)(cid:0)1
1 (cid:0) (cid:28) C1
C (cid:0)1
1 (cid:0) (cid:28) (cid:19)(cid:0)1
1 = R (cid:18)R
1 (cid:0) (cid:28)
(cid:15) but not with CRA>1, e.g. u (c) = c1(cid:0)(cid:13) = (1 (cid:0) (cid:13) ), then
1(cid:0)(cid:13) > R (cid:18)R
1 (cid:0) (cid:28) (cid:19)(cid:0)(cid:13)
1 (cid:0) (cid:28)
if (cid:13) > 1

How do we implement a banking allocation?

(cid:15) O⁄er all consumers the option to withdraw C1 in the (cid:133)rst period: demand
deposit contract

(cid:15) incentive compatibility:
1. for the early consumers is trivial:

u (C1) (cid:21) u (0 + 0C2) = 0
2. for the late consumers:

u (C1) (cid:21) u (C2)
because C2 > C1 (from result above)

Unique implementation?

(cid:15) Given that the bank o⁄ers to all consumers the possibility to withdraw there
exists an equilibrium where only early consumers withdraw (IC ensures that)

(cid:15) but is that the only equilibrium?

(cid:15) with a demand deposit contract NO

Bad equilibrium

(cid:15) All consumers apply for C1 in (cid:133)rst period

(cid:15) The bank only has 1 unit of asset to liquidate

(cid:15) Some consumers are rationed (the ones last in line)

(cid:15) Why late consumers do not wait?

(cid:15) If you do not apply for C1 you get
max f1 (cid:0) ~(cid:28) C1; 0g
~C2 = R
1 (cid:0) ~(cid:28)
where ~(cid:28) is the number of consumers who apply for C1

(cid:15) So if ~(cid:28) = 1 then ~C2 = 0

(cid:15) If you expect everyone to run, running is a best response

Suspension of convertibility

(cid:15) The bank announces:
I(cid:146)ll give C1 to the (cid:133)rst (cid:28) people that show up in
period 1, 0 to the rest of them

(cid:15) Now it is optimal to wait for a late consumer

(cid:15) Equilibrium is unique

(cid:15) But now introduce some aggregate uncertainty about (cid:28) : (cid:28) is a random
variable with CDF F ((cid:28) )

(cid:15) sometimes there is more early consumers, sometimes less

(cid:15) Now optimum has
u0 (C1 ((cid:28) )) = Ru0  R

1 (cid:0) (cid:28) C1 ((cid:28) )
1 (cid:0) (cid:28)

!

(cid:15) This optimum is incentive compatible but it cannot be implemented if
the bank is facing a sequential service constraint : You can only assign
consumption to consumers who show up in period 1 on the basis of their
position in the line

Simple alternative: Demand deposits + deposit insurance

(cid:15) Historically this combination has proved very succesful

(cid:15) Now is the government that takes care of making C1 state contingent: if
too many people show up, everyone is taxed so that they get paid and the
late consumers are protected

(cid:15) The government e⁄ectively has a way of intervening after (cid:28) is realized

(cid:15) In this way the bad equilibrium is ruled out

(cid:15) Important principle: the gov(cid:146)t does not actually intervene in equilibrium

(cid:15) Just announcing intervention o⁄-the-equilibrium path, eliminates the bad
equilibrium

(cid:15) These are very desirable policy interventions: no actual intervention (no
tax levied, no distortion created), very big e⁄ects (sometimes too good to
be true?)

Repo market: reinterpreting a bank run

(cid:15) The bank borrows short term from the consumers to invest in long run
project and at the same time sells equity shares

(cid:15) Promises to repay rate of return C1=1 > 1 with expectation that the loan
will be rolled over

(cid:15) If consumers decide to roll over they will get C2=1 > C1=1

(cid:15) If loan not rolled over the bank won(cid:146)t be able to o⁄er positive return to
consumers C2=1

(cid:15) Bad equilibrium: banks refuse to roll over ! (cid:147)run(cid:148) followed by bankruptcy

(cid:15) The model can be reinvented to better match the competitive determina-
tion of interest rates in repo markets (and the role of collateral)

(cid:15) But the underlying logic is there
