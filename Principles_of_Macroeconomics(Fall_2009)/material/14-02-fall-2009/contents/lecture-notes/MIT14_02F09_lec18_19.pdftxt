Fiscal Policy

• Fiscal policy is the use of government spending G and taxes T

• Objective: stabilize the economy

• Governments can have:

– Output targets
Output targets
– Price targets
– Unemployment targets

•

•

•

Stabilizing the economy means moving the economy towards its targets.  We will ignore 
price targets for now (we have no prices in our model yet).

Suppose the government has an output target and suppose that target is Y* (we will

also explain why Y* is a good target later in the course).

Fiscal policy then would be the manipulation of G and T to move the economy towards 
Y*.  (Assumes government knows where Y* is - we will discuss other drawbacks to

fiscal policy later in the course).

Government Deficit (some approximations)

Let us make the following linear approximations:

1. Tax Revenues = T0 + t Y
1. Tax Revenues  
 T + tnY

1. Transfers  = Tr0 – g Y

When Y increases, Taxes increase (more earnings in economy)

When Y increases, Transfers fall (less people on welfare)

Actual Government Deficits

= G + Tr + Interest - T

G + (T 0
(T0 + t Y )
=  G + (Tr0 – g Y) + Interest – (T0 + tnY )
t
Y) + I t

= G + Tr0 + Interest – T0 – (tn+g) Y 

13

Automatic stabilizers
For now, assume T0 = Tr0 = Interest = 0

Actual Deficit = G – (t +g) Y
Actual Deficit
 G 
(tn+g) Y 

Automatic stabilizers: budget systems that cause G to rise or T to fall
automatically when Y fall!
y

Side effect: government budget deficits tend to increase in recessions!

Structural Budget Deficits (or full-employment deficit) is the deficit that would
exist in the economy if the economy was at Y*, given the current policies.
It eliminates the effect of stabilizers!

Structural Budget Deficits = G – (tn + g)Y*

Cyclical Deficits: Actual Deficits - Structural Deficits
Cyclical Deficits:  Actual Deficits - Structural Deficits

14

Types of Deficits

•

In general:   Deficits are countercyclical! (They rise when Y falls and fall 
when Y rises))

• Even if the government has a policy (combination of G and T) that would lead 
to no deficits at Y*, deficits still occur (Y does not always equal Y*!).

• Welfare Payments, Unemployment Insurance, and Tax System dampen the 
effects of consumption over the business cycle.

– T goes up when times are good (like in the late 1990s).
– G/Tr goes up when times are bad (welfare payments).

• Given Automatic Stabilizers (and potentially proactive governmental fiscal 
policies), cyclical deficits seem to be an inherent part of our economy.

15

Graphing Deficits When Policy Is Constant 

Assume the fiscal policy is constant = G, T0, Tr0, g, tn are fixed.
Even when the structural deficit is close to zero, actual deficits can be large when Y < Y*!

Governments Debt
• The Government Debt (B) is the total value of government bonds outstanding 
at any particular time.

•

Important distinction: government deficit is a flow variable, government debt a 
stock variable! 

• A given year deficit = new borrowing that the government must do = change in 
the debt that year

ΔB = change in the nominal value of gov bonds outstanding = nominal budget deficit

• Debt/GDP is useful measure of indebtedness, given that a country with high 
GDP has more resources to pay interests on gov bonds!

Δ(Debt/GDP) = deficit/GDP – Debt/GDP * (ΔGDP)/GDP

Should Governments Try To Prevent Deficits?

• Examples:  U.S. Balanced Budget Amendment.   Criteria for entry to EMU that 
deficit/GDP be 3% or less and that debt/GDP be 60% or less.

• Benefits: limit spending.   If spend today, government must:
1)  Raise Taxes Now       
2)  Raise Taxes in Future
)
3)  Print Money In Future  (will lead to Inflation)
Solutions (2) and (3) may be more costly from an economic point of view but are 
politically more appealing!

• Costs: balanced budget amendments can make recessions worse. Think at the current 
recession. As Y falls, tax revenues fall.  As tax revenues fall, (cyclical) deficit 
i
increases. If the government has to balance the budget, it would either have to cut G/Tr 
t G/T
If th

Conclusion : it may be bad to have policies requiring governments to eliminate all deficits
Conclusion : it may be bad to have policies requiring governments to eliminate all deficits, 
but there may be some benefits from eliminating structural deficits.

Costs and Benefits of Government Spending

Consumption G

Governments can provide services that may be inefficiently provided in private sector
(i.e., police protection, parks, post office, etc).

Investment G: Physical Capital

Governments can provide investment that is used as an input into other production
(i.e., highway and transportation infrastructure, bridges, enforce property rights).

Investment G: Training and Education

Governments can train the work force 
(i e student loan programs public education state colleges etc)
(i.e., student loan programs, public education, state colleges, etc).

Must compare the benefits to the costs of government spending!

21

after the year of purchase. 
It amounts to about 2% of GWP (gross world product).

Public Debt:  A Burden on Future Generations ?

Case for Yes: 
Higher deficits mean higher consumption G and/or (through lower T) higher 
C. Thus higher deficits potentially mean lower national saving S. Lower S 
results in lower I (S=I).  Lower I today  results in lower K for the next 
generation. All else equal, higher government deficits today could reduce the

Case for No:

that create higher future A.  Higher future A could make future generations 
better off even if future K is lower.

24

Does the Debt Payback Hurt Future Generations ?

•

If we run deficits today, future generations will have to pay for our spending.  
Policy makers often say that our spending today will decrease the consumption of our 
children by X%y

• When government borrows to finance a deficit, they borrow from the current 
generation (give bonds to me and you).  Eventually, these bonds will end up in the 
hands of the future generation (we will leave them to future generation directly or
hands of the future generation (we will leave them to future generation - directly or 
indirectly).  When government repays the debt - it will take taxes from the future 
generation and pay off the same future generation - they own the debt! (caveat - some 
debt is held by foreign citizens and distributional issues). 

•

Summary: when we leave a deficit to our children, we leave them both the assets and 
the liabilities associated with the debt. The paying back of debt is a zero sum game (just 
a reshuffling in the economy)!
g
y)

• Are Deficits bad for future generations?  Could be (see previous slide) - but, it has 
nothing to do with the fact that the deficit has to be repaid , unless a large proportion is 
held by foreigners
held by foreigners.

25

Ricardian Equivalence

Ricardian Equivalence:  Theory that states that consumers behavior is equivalent
regardless if the government finances G through increased taxes or through
increased debt. 

•

If the government floats debt to finance spending today, consumers realize that, 
g

,
at some time in the future, it will have to raise taxes to pay back the debt.

• As a result, a reduction in taxes today (an increase in G today) will be seen as
As a result, a reduction in taxes today (an increase in G today) will be seen as 
being accompanied by higher taxes in the future.  Households will save today 
to fund the future tax increases. National Saving would remain unchanged.

• Does this theory hold empirically?  NO!  Private Savings was falling during 
the large deficits of the 80s.  People, when asked, tend not to think this way.

This randomization allows them to identify the causal effect of the rebate by 
comparing the spending of households that received the rebate earlier to that of 
households that received it later.

Supply Side Economics: Incentives

• Fiscal policies affect the macroeconomics also through the supply side: tax 
policies affect incentives!

• Average tax rate = total amount of taxes paid by a person divided by the 
person’s before-tax income

• Marginal tax rate = fraction of an additional dollar of income that must be 
paid in taxes

• Example: Tax of 25% levied on income above $10,000. Person with income of 
$18,000 pays $2,000. Average tax rate = 11.1%. Marginal tax rate = 25%.

•

•

Increase in average tax rate, with constant marginal, will increase labor supply. 
Income effect!

Increase in marginal tax rate, with constant average, will reduce labor supply. 
Substitution effect!
36

Supply Side Economics

Emphasize substitution effects of marginal tax rates.

Common idea: people would work more if tn were lower and
would save more if ts were lower.

Where it may be wrong: Tax cuts (lower tn/ts and lower T) 
have income effects which can potentially dominate.  N falls (and S falls).

Where it may be right: Tax Reforms (lower t but T=0)
do not have income effects, but only substitution effects:  N and S rise.

Another margin where it may be right: Positive effects on human capital
investment?  Becker and Lucas of the U of C think so.

37

Notes on Supply Side Economics

By Tax Reform economists mean revenue-neutral reform in the way taxes are collected.  
In some Flat Tax proposals this involves eliminating tax deductions (e.g. home mortgage 
interest) and lowering income tax rates To see how this can be revenue-neutral
interest) and lowering income tax rates.  To see how this can be revenue neutral, 
suppose T = tn*(Y - D) where D = tax deductions.  One can lower tn and D so that, for a 
given Y, T will be unchanged.   Tax reforms that lower tn’s have substitution effects, 
but no income effects since T=0.  Such Tax Reforms have positive effects on labor 
supply and on private saving (with no negative effects on government saving).

Why is increasing N and S efficient?  Because, relative to an efficient tax code, the 
existing tax code discourages N and S(household).  The most efficient (but not

has positive marginal tax rates and lots of deductions.  Moving from the current tax code
