PART I: GDP

Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

• GDP is a measure of output! 

• Why Do We Care?  

– Because output is highly correlated (at certain times) with things we care about 
(standard of living, wages, unemployment, inflation, budget and trade deficits, value 
of currency, etc…) 

• Formal Definition:  

– GDP is the Market Value of all Final Goods and Services Newly Produced on 
Domestic Soil During a Given Time Period (different than GNP)

4

Three ways of measuring GDP

• Production Method:   Measure the Value Added summed across all
firms (value added = sale price less cost of raw
firms  (value added 
 sale price less cost of raw 
materials)

•

Income Method:
Income Method: 

Labor Income (wages/salary) +
Labor Income (wages/salary) + 
Capital Income (rent, interest, dividends, profits)+ 
Government Income (taxes)

• Expenditure Method:  Spending by consumers (C)  +  Spending by businesses 
(I)  + Spending by government (G)  + Net Spending by 
foreign sector (NX)
g
(
)

• Fundamental identity of national income account: 

total production = total income = total expenditure

What is the total value (in dollars) of the economic activity generated by these 2 firms?

Production Method (value added: sales – intermediate good): 35K  + (40K– 25K) = 50K

Income Method (Wages + Profits + Taxes) = 15K + 10K + 15K + 3K + 5K + 2K = 50K
Income Method (Wages + Profits + Taxes)  
 15K + 10K + 15K + 3K + 5K + 2K 
 50K

Expenditure approach (expenditure by final users): 10K + 40K = 50K 

6

“Production” Equals “Expenditure”
• GDP (for us Y) is a measure of Market Production!
Market value = how much you have to spend to buy

• What is produced in the market has to show up as being purchased or held by 
some economic agent; 

• Who are the economic agents we will consider on the expenditure side?

– Consumers (refer to expenditure of consumers as “consumption”)
(
p
p
)
– Businesses (refer to expenditure of firms as “investment”)
– Governments (refer to expenditures of governments as “government spending”)
– Foreign Sector (refer to expenditures of foreign sector as “net exports”)

• For us, we will predominantly spend our time working with the Expenditure 
Approach:

*******

Y = C + I + G + NX

Defining the Expenditure Components

• Consumption (C):  

– The Sum of Durables, Non-Durables and Services Purchased Domestically by Non-
Businesses and Non-Governments (ie, individual consumers).
– Includes Haircuts (services), Refrigerators (durables), and Apples (non-durables).
– Does Not Include Purchases of New Housing.

– Land purchases are NOT counted as part of GDP (land is not produced!!)
– Stock purchases are NOT counted as part of GDP (stock transactions do NOT 
represent production – they are saving!)

For the U.S., 2/3 of this is at the state level (police and fire protection, school 
teachers, snow plowing) and 1/3 is at the federal level (President, Post Office, 
Missiles).  

• NOTE:  Welfare and Social Security are NOT Government Spending.  These 
are Transfer Payments.  Nothing is Produced in this Case.

More on Expenditure Components
• Only include expenditures for goods that are “produced”.

– If I give $10 to a movie theater to watch a movie, it is counted as expenditure.
– If I give $10 to my friend for a birthday present, it is not counted as expenditure.
– If I give $10 to the ATM machine to put in my savings account, it is not counted as 
expenditure

• The second example would be considered a “transfer” (once I give $10 to my 
friend, he can go to the movies if he wants to – once that $10 is spent, it will

show up in GDP).

– “Transfers” are defined as the exchange of economic resources from one economic 
agent to another when no goods or services are exchanged.

Preview: Accounting vs Economics
Y = C + I + G + NX

• Macroeconomics studies the determinants of Y (= aggregate supply) and 
C+I+G+NX (aggregate demand), and shows how, in equilibrium, 
prices/wages/interest rates/exchange rates have to adjust such that 
AS = AD.
– Classic economics believes prices/wages move immediately to attain 
equilibrium.
– Keynesian economics sticky prices/wages give rise to unemployment 
and an active role to monetary policy.

• With this basic setup we can understand how changes in the determinants of 
aggregate demand and supply affect growth and prices in an economy.

and that of one’s loved ones.

PART II: Inflation

Real versus Nominal variables
• Using current market values allows summing different types of goods and 
services, but how to compare variables over time? 

Production today
20 computers 
20 bicycles

Production tomorrow
20 computers 
20 bicycles

• If prices of computers and bicycles double between today and tomorrow, the 
current market value of GDP (i.e., nominal GDP) also doubles. However, the 
amount of physical production remains unchanged.

• What’s wrong? Nominal GDP today is expressed in terms of dollars of today 
and nominal GDP tomorrow is expressed in terms of dollars of tomorrow. If 
there is inflation, the purchasing power of the dollar has changed over time.

• By looking at the current market value of goods changes over time, you can’t 
tell whether this change reflects changes in the goods produced or in their 
prices. That is why we need to look at the “real” GDP or at constant prices.

20

Prices and Inflation
• To compare the market value of output over time, we need to know how does 
the purchasing power of 1$ change over time. For that we need a price index.

Ho Are Prices Meas red?
• How Are Prices Measured? 

• Price Indexes measure the cost of a fixed ‘basket’ of goods over time

22

Using Prices to distinguish between Nominal and Real Variables

• Nominal GDP is output valued at Current Prices

• Comparing Nominal GDPs over time can become problematic

– Confuses changes in Output (production) with changes in prices

• Real GDP is output valued at some Constant Level of Prices (prices in a base 
year).

Real GDP(t)  = Nominal GDP(t) / Price Index (t)

• Growth in Real GDP:
% Δ in Real GDP =  [Real GDP (t+1)  - Real GDP (t)] / Real GDP (t)
or (approximately)
% Δ in Real GDP =  % Δ in Nominal GDP - % Δ in P

course, we will assume everything is real unless otherwise told.

The Mechanics of The Course (1)

The Demand Side

• The aggregate demand (AD) curve represents the expenditure (demand) side of 
the economy. 

• Aggregate demand curve will relates price changes with changes in ‘real’
• Aggregate demand curve will relates price changes with changes in  real
expenditures.

• Demand side of the economy will be the expenditure side of the economy!

Y = C + I + G + NX  (what we learned above)

• We will prove later in the course that the AD curve slopes down (take my word 
for it now).  As prices increase, aggregate demand in the economy will fall.

The AD curve does not need to slope down linearly - it could have some curvature.  
We draw it linearly for simplicity.

The AD curve only shifts when C, I, G, or NX changes.

41

The Mechanics of The Course (2)

The Supply Side

• The aggregate supply (AS) curve represents the production (supply) side of the 
economy. The supply side of the economy is determined by firm production.

• Aggregate supply curve relates price changes with changes in production.

• The focus of next week’s lecture will be on the aggregate production function 
gg g
p
for the economy.  

Y = f(inputs in the economy; land, labor, machines, oil, etc)

• We will prove later in the course that the short run AS curve slopes upward 
(take my word again!).  As prices increase, aggregate production in the 
economy will rise.

The short run AS curve is not linearly sloped.  We usually draw it linearly for 
simplicity.  In the real world, the SRAS curve is flatter at lower levels of GDP.

The AS curve only shifts when the price of factors of production change (things like 
oil prices, wages, and such) or the means of production change (technology) – wait 
43
for next week!

LONG RUN: Potential Output (Y*)

• Potential Output (Y*) is going to be the level of output in the economy where 
the economy is in long run equilibrium.  In other words, if no shocks hit the 
economy, the economy will stay at Y* (or it will gravitate towards Y*).
h
ill
Y* (
i
ill
i
d Y*)

(ok, that definition is kind of technical, what does Y* really mean?)

• Think of it this way, Y* is the level of economic activity that the economy was 
designed to sustain:
g

– People are working the ‘right’ amount given labor market conditions (not 
working too much not working too little)
working too much, not working too little),
– Machines are working the right amount given profit maximizing conditions 
(not working too much, not working too little)

• We will formalize this (and all concepts) as the course progresses.

Demand Shocks

The relationship between inflation and output when aggregate demand shifts: 
Suppose we are in long run equilibrium at point (a) (AD = SRAS = LRAS)

If the economy receives a negative aggregate demand shock short run equilibrium
If the economy receives a negative aggregate demand shock, short run equilibrium 
will move from point (a) to point (b).  Output will fall (from Y* to Y’).  Prices will fall 
(from P to P’).

Demand shocks cause prices and output to move in the same direction.
(You should be able to illustrate a positive demand shock)

Supply shocks cause prices and output to move in opposite directions.
(You should be able to illustrate a positive supply shock)

Reinterpreting the Business Cycle Data 1970-2001

1970 recession:

1981 recession:

1990 recession:

Inflation increasing at start of recession! 
High Increasing Inflation (supply shock: rising oil prices)

Dramatic decrease in inflation at start of recession
No inflation (demand shock: Fed induced recession)

Little increase in inflation/but low level of inflation (demand 
shock:  fall in consumer confidence/oil price increase)

Rapid growth in mid 1990s: No inflation (supply shock:  IT revolution)

2001 recession:
2001 recession:

No inflation (demand shock: over confidence by firms:
