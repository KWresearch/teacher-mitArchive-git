Production Function

The Production Function
• GDP (Y) is produced with capital (K) and labor (N):

Y = A F(K,N)
Y 
 A F(K,N)

where A is Total Factor Productivity (TFP) 
= an index of efficiency in the use of inputs (technology)
y
p
(
gy)

• Sometimes, I will modify the production function as follows:

Y = A F(K,N, other inputs) 

where other inputs include energy/oil!

• Realistic Example is a Cobb Douglas function for F(.):

Y =A Kα N1- α
Y =A K N

with 0< α <1

4

Measurement

• Y is GDP (it is measured in dollars).  As noted above, we want to measure Y 
in “real” terms.<<you should know what this means from lecture 2>>.
y

• For our Cobb Douglas production function, N is measured in number of 
workers and K in dollars:

– K often is measured as the replacement cost of capital
– N often is measured in number of workers

• N can also be measured using 
total hours worked = number of workers × hours per worker
p

• Wage differentials can help to measure “effective labor supply”, taking into 
account “skill” differentials.

N.B.: sometimes we will use N to denote total population (e.g. income per capitaY/N)

Cobb-Douglas:

2Y = AF(2K,2N)
2Y 
 AF(2K,2N)

2Y = A (2K)α (2N) 1- α = 2A K α N 1- α

CRUCIAL: α + (1- α) = 1!

Aggregate Production Function: Fact 2

2.

Diminishing Returns to N and K

Define MPN = Marginal Product of Labor = dY/dN
Define MPK = Marginal Product of Capital = dY/dK

FACT 2: MPN decreases with N and MPK decreases with K
FACT 2: MPN decreases with N and MPK decreases with K

Cobb-Douglas:





MPN (1
) A (K/N)α
MPN =  (1- α) A (K/N)α

Fixing A and K, MPN falls when N increases

MPK = α A (N/K)(1- α)

Fixing A and N, MPK falls when K increases

Aggregate Production Function: Fact 3

3.

Complementarities between A, K and N

FACT 3: The higher the level of capital (or technology), the higher 
the marginal product of labor (and symmetrically for capital!)

Cobb-Douglas:
g





MPN = (1- α) A (K/N)α

Increasing A or K increases MPN
Increasing A or K, increases MPN

MPK = α A (N/K)(1- α)

Increasing A or N, increases MPK

Aggregate Production Function: Fact 4

4.

Elasticities and Income Shares



Elasticity is the percentage increase in Y (dependent variable) resulting from a 
1% increase in X (independent variable), everything else constant

N = % change in Y / % change in N = (dY/Y)/ (dN/N) = MPN / (Y/N)

FACT 4:

Labor Elasticity ~ .7
Capital Elasticity ~ .3

Cobb-Douglas:

N = (1- α) and K = α
 (1 α)   and   K  α
N
That’s why we pick α = .3 !!




Share of labor income out of total GDP is about 70%
Share of labor income out of total GDP is about 70%
Share of capital income out of total GDP is about 30%

Driven by A and K/N

• Total Factor Productivity (TFP) = Y/F(K,N) = A

The Labor Market

Part I: Labor Demand

•

In a competitive market, a firm can sell as much Y as it wants at the going 
price p, and can hire as much N as it wants at the going wage w.

• Facing w and p, a profit maximizing firm hires N to the point where

output, must equal the cost of hiring him).  <<This is straight from micro>>

Why? MPN is decreasing in N, hence:
– If MPN > w/p then the firm can increase profits by increasing N.  
– If MPN < w/p then the firm can increase profits by decreasing N.

• With Cobb-Douglas:  MPN = .7 Y/N = .7 A (K/N).3
If firms maximize profits:  w/p = .7 Y/N = .7 A (K/N).3

• Nd slopes downward : Nd = MPN = .7 A * (K/N).3

• Nd shifts up with A and K (complementarity)

Labor Supply (Ns) Results from Individual Optimization Decisions

Households compare benefits of working (additional lifetime resources) with 
cost of working (forgone leisure + effort) 

How much labor an household will choose to supply as the real wage 
(before taxes) w/p varies?

2 effects:

1.

Substitution effect: higher real wage means higher reward to working,

hence you want to work more! 

Income effect: higher real wage means you are richer, hence you need 
to work less to consume the same goods!

Refresh your memory from Micro!

Think of an agent who gets utility from consuming apples and bananas

From the utility maximization problem you get

MU(apples)/ MU(bananas) = P(apples)/P(bananas)
MU(apples)/ MU(bananas) 
 P(apples)/P(bananas)

If P(apples) increases:

1.

2.

Substitution effect: you want to increase MU(apples )/ MU(bananas). 
By the law of diminishing marginal utility you need to consume less 
apples and more bananas! You subsitute away from apples towards 
pp
y

bananas

Income effect: you spend more for the apples that you buy, so you are 
poorer. You will consume less apples AND bananas!

20

From Micro to Macro…

The two goods that the household can consume are now consumption (C) and leisure (L)

(L) th t i N + L 1
The household can spend 1 unit of time either working (N) or having fun (L), that is N + L = 1

The budget constraint is WN = PC (and P(C)=P for simplicity) with N=1-L. Then we can 
write a static version of the maximization problem as:

Max U(C,L)
s.t. W = PC + WL

The price of leisure is the foregone wages that is P(L) = W Then
The price of leisure is the foregone wages, that is P(L) 
 W. Then

MU(L)/ MU(C) = W/ P

If W/P increases:

Substitution effect: you want to increase MU(L)/ MU(C). By the law of diminishing 
marginal utility you need to subsitute away from leisure towards consumption goods. Then 
you need to work more!

Income effect: you have higher wages, so you are richer. You will consume more C and 
L. To consume more L you need to work less!
21

Back to the Labor Supply

•

In reality the household problem is not static. Define PVLR = present value of 
life time resources, that determines the household income.
life time resources, that determines the household income. 

• For simplicity to graph the Labor Supply we separate income and 
substitution effects by separating PVLR from the current real wage w/p
substitution effects by separating PVLR from the current real wage w/p.

• PVLR represents the income effect and w/p the substitution effect.

• SHORTCUT: if w/p increases permanently PVLR increases as well, BUT if 
w/p increases temporarily only, then PVLR increases just a tiny bit so that we 
assume that PVLR does not change!

22

The Labor Supply Curve

• Factors Affecting Labor Supply

– The Real Wage (w/p)
– The Household’s Present Value of Lifetime Resources (PVLR)
– The Marginal Tax Rate on Labor Income (tn)
– The Marginal Tax Rate on Consumption (tc)
– Value of Leisure (reservation wage) - non-’work’ status (VL) 
– The Working Age Population (pop)

• Labor Supply (N ) shows the relationship between real wages and hours
• Labor Supply (Ns) shows the relationship between real wages and hours 
worked holding everything else constant (included PVLR!)

• The Real Wage - HOLDING PVLR fixed:  A higher w/p encourages individuals to

substitute away from leisure toward work (leisure becomes more expensive).  This is a 
substitution effect.  <<This is why the labor supply curve slopes upwards>>

• Estimating this substitution effect is difficult since PVLR is not easily held constant
• Estimating this substitution effect is difficult since PVLR is not easily held constant.    
Estimates range from 0 - 2 (For a 1% increase in after-tax w/p holding PVLR fixed, 
labor supply either increases between 0% and 2%).  Very Wide Range – little 
consensus.  

•

PVLR = initial wealth + present discounted value of earnings

• A higher PVLR induces individuals to work less (lower N ) for a given after-tax wage
A higher PVLR induces individuals to work less (lower Ns) for a given after tax wage, 
allowing them to enjoy more leisure (If leisure is preferred to work – as I get richer, I 
can afford to work less).  <<This is represented by a shift of the supply curve >>

• Marginal tax rate on consumption - see above

• Value of Leisure - If leisure/no-work becomes more/less attractive, 
households will work less/more (think about welfare programs, child care,…)

Labor Force Participation Rates)

Higher A countries have higher w/p and lower N/pop.

Implications:

Adjusting for pop, higher A goes with lower N.
Higher A reduces Nd and destroys jobs? - NO! Labor Demand Increases.
Higher A increases PVLR and reduces N It is Labor Supply that falls
Higher A increases PVLR and reduces Ns. It is Labor Supply that falls.

Labor Market Equilibrium (Long Run)

• We define Long Run Equilibrium in macroeconomics as occurring when the 
labor market clears.

•

•

•

•

By definition, long run macro equilibrium exists when N = N*.

At N*, labor demand = labor supply.  So, by definition, all workers who want a 
job (the suppliers) are able to find a firm looking for a worker (the demanders).

Long run equilibrium is characterized by zero cyclical unemployment!

It is an equilibrium such that there is no incentive for real wages to change at N*

Real wages have 2 components: nominal wages (w) and the price level (p).

Define Y* as the long run equilibrium level of output (output when labor market is 
in equilibrium):

Y* = A K.3(N*).7 

41

Long Run Aggregate Supply

In terms of equilibrium nothing happens!
In terms of equilibrium, nothing happens!
Increasing prices have no effect on labor demand (A and K do not change).
Increasing prices have no effect on labor supply (taxes, population, etc. do not 
change).

You may ask “Doesn’t PVLR change when prices increase???” No!

•

•

•

As long as nominal wages adjust real wages will be unchanged when p
As long as nominal wages adjust, real wages will be unchanged when p 
increases.
The % change in prices will be matched exactly by the % change in 
nominal wages – real wages will not change (so PVLR will not change).

As a result, there will be no change in N* and hence, no change in Y*.

Leads to a vertical LRAS curve.  Prices do not affect production in the long run!
43

What shifts Y*? (the LRAS)

•

•

•

•

Anything that affects the labor market will affect Y*!

If N* increases, Y* will shift to the right.

If N* decreases, Y* will shift to the left.

Summary:  Y* will shift right if:

Preview: Disequilibrium in Labor Markets

• When do we get cyclical unemployment in our models? So far NO unemployment! We 
need some frictions in the labor market to get cyclical unemployment.

• Cyclical unemployment occurs when labor demand is smaller than labor supply at 
current wages (one story: nominal wages do not adjust to clear the labor market).

• Cyclical unemployment occurs only in disequilibrium!
