Money Supply

• We have mentioned before that money supply is affected by:

1. The Central Bank (the Federal Reserve System in the United States) is 
the government institution responsible for monetary policies

2. Depositary Institutions (Banks) are privately owned banks and thrift 
institutions that accept deposits from and make loans directly to the public

3. The public includes every person or firm (except banks) that holds money 
in currency or deposits.

3

The Banking System: An Introduction

Bank Assets and Liabilities:

Assets:
Liabilities:

Loans (TL) + Reserves (TR)
Deposits (TD).

Reserves =  liquid assets held by the bank to meet the demand for
withdrawals by depositors or to pay checks
withdrawals by depositors or to pay checks

How do banks make money?      They Lend.

How much do they lend?   Must keep a minimum amount of reserves 
(required by law)
(required by law).

The Banking System: An Introduction

Fractional reserve banking: banks hold only a fraction of their deposits 
in  reserve.

Reserve-deposit ratio =  required reserves/deposits = m

Fractional reserve banking → m<1 (100% reserve banking → m=1) 

Assume banks lend all they can: TR = m*TD
Assume banks lend all they can:   TR = m*TD, 

TD = TL + TR

(money held within the banking system)

•

ΔTD = ΔTL + ΔTR

The Banking System: An Example
Suppose I put $500 in the bank (remove it from under my mattress).
We call the $500 that starts the process the ‘Initial Deposit’ (ID)
*** Suppose that no one else in the economy holds cash
 Suppose that no one else in the economy holds cash.
*** Suppose banks lend to their limit.
Suppose that m = 0.1.

What happens in the banking system (assume nobody wants to hold currency):

Step 1:   Deposits increase by $500 (initial deposit).
Step 2:   Then, Deposits increase by another $450.
Step 3: Then Deposits increase by another $405
Step 3:   Then, Deposits increase by another $405.
Step 4: 
………….(keep increasing)
Step infinity:  ………….(keep increasing)

Why do deposits keep increasing?  LOANS!!!!

6

The Banking System: An Example

Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Assets
TR $ 500

Liabilities
TD $500

TR* = .1*500 = 50 →

ΔTL = TR – TR* = 450

Assets
TR $ 500
TL $ 450

Liabilities
TD $950

TR* = .1*950 = 95 →
TR  
 .1 950 
 95 →

ΔTL = TR – TR* = 405
ΔTL 
 TR  TR  
 405

Assets
TR $ 500
TL $ 855
TL $ 855

Liabilities
TD $ 1355

TR* = .1* 1355 = 135.5

→

ΔTL = TR – TR* = 364.5

Loans and deposits expand up to a point TR* = TR, that is, TD = TR / m = 5000 !

7

The Money Multiplier

Total Change in Deposits:

= ID + ID (1-m) + ID(1-m)2 + …
= ID (1 + (1-m) + (1-m)2 +
 ID (1 + (1-m) + (1-m) + … )
)
= ID (1/m)

Money Multiplier μm = 1/m

Some caveats:

TD = (1/m) ID

– There are holding of currency out of the banking system
– Banks may hold excess reserves

8

Money Supply and Monetary Base
• MS = Money Supply

•

•

TC = Total Currency in Circulation (outside banking system)

BASE = Monetary base

• MS = TC + TD

ΔMS = ΔTC + ΔTD
S
C

→ ΔMS = ΔTC + ΔTR + ΔTL

•

BASE = TC + TR 

(liabilities of the Central Bank that can be used
as money + currency hold by the public)

Central Bank controls directly the monetary base BUT not the money supply!

Money Supply and Monetary Base

Combining the two definitions we get

MS/BASE = (TC + TD) / (TC + TR)

TC/TD = cu = currency/deposit ratio depends on the amount of money the

Recall TR/TD = reserves/deposits ratio determined by the banks + regulation

Notes on Central Banks

• The Central Bank is The Banks’ Bank.  The Central Bank operates a clearinghouse for 
bank checks.  Each member bank has an account with the Central Bank.  In the U.S. the 
deposits that banks have with the Fed are called federal funds
deposits that  banks have with the Fed are called federal funds.

• A closely related term, which is not specific to the U.S., is banks’  reserves (which consist 
of federal funds plus “vault cash”, or currency in the bank’ s cash machines, teller drawers, 
p
,
y
,
,
and vault). 

• A check written against private bank A and deposited with private bank B reduces bank A’s 
federal funds and increases bank B’s federal funds.  Thus banks want federal funds so they 
can honor check withdrawals.  They want vault cash to honor cash withdrawals.  
Upshot:  banks need reserves to honor withdrawals.

• Neither the Fed nor other major Central Banks target growth rates of the money supply
(which consists of currency plus various measures of liquid assets like deposits).   

• Fed targets the Federal Funds rate.

13

What is the federal funds rate?
• Federal funds are the deposits of private banks with the Fed.

• The federal funds market consists of private banks borrowing and lending their 
federal funds amongst each other overnight.

• The federal funds rate is the interest rate on these overnight loans. It is set by 
supply and demand not by the Fed
supply and demand, not by the Fed.

• The Fed can change the supply of federal funds through open market 
g
pp y
g
p
operations, exerting a powerful indirect effect on the fed funds rate.

• The Fed targets the federal funds rate and carries out open market operations to 
keep the actual rate near the target rate.

14

What are Open Market Operations?

Open market operations  =  Central Bank purchases and sales of government 
securities on the open market.

Open market purchase (sale)  = Central Bank purchases (sells) government 
securities.  The seller (buyer) receives (uses) federal funds as payment.

Federal Funds

Central Banks

Governments Bonds

Private Banks

Reserves

borrow, so a lower federal funds rate.  (An increase in the supply of federal

new zero interest earning reserves into loans (which in turn creates more deposits, 
raising the money supply).  To get people/firms to borrow more (take the new 
loans they are offering), banks lower the interest rate on the loans.

Bottom Line:  A Fed purchase of government securities lowers i.

Notes on FOMC directives

The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets every 6 weeks and issues a 
directive to the trading desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.        

Fed Time: the Desk carries out open market operations between 11:30 and 11:45 ET each trading 
day to keep the actual fed funds rate near the target.  

The FOMC directive is also asymmetric or symmetric:
Symmetric:
No bias.  Neutral stance.  Just as likely to raise as to lower the target next.
Asymmetric:
A bias toward easing (more likely to lower than raise the target next) or a bias toward

tightening (more likely to raise than lower the target next).

The federal funds rate vs. the discount rate

21

The Fed’s Balance Sheet

• The Fed receives interest on its assets (U.S. government securities + loans to 
banks).

• The Fed pays no interest on its liabilities (currency and fed funds).

• The Fed is highly profitable, which fosters its independence.  The Fed returns 
Th F d i hi hl
fi bl

i
i d
d
Th F d
its profits to the Treasury.  

• Hence the interest that the Treasury pays on securities held by the Fed is not a 
cost for the Government: that portion of public debt is effectively monetized
(pays 0 interest)
(pays 0 interest)

22

Monetizing Government Debt

The Central Bank buys public debt with reserves.

• When public debt is growing faster than GDP, there is political pressure on the 
Central Bank to monetize some of the government debt b/c

– public debt pays interest, reserves do not;
– fixed nominal debt is easier to pay off the higher is P.

• Large budget deficits are the underlying cause of hyperinflations.  The debt and 
deficit limits in Europe’s EMU are meant to prevent member countries from 
pushing for higher inflation.

• Central Bank independence from fiscal authorities can insulate it from 
pressure to monetize the public debt.

Summing Up 

Nominal Money Supply (Ms):

Affected By the Fed (and by the public and by other banks)

Fed conducts monetary policy to increase Money Supply:

O M k t P
- Open Market Purchases
h
- Decrease the reserve ratio
- Decrease the Discount Rate

27

Goals of the Fed

• The Fed wants to set r so that
– output/unemployment target: Y = Y* or U = U*
– inflation target:  =  * (2% inflation).

• The Fed wants to raise r when
– Y > Y* U < U* N > N*
Y > Y , U < U , N > N
–  >  *

• The Fed wants to lower r when the opposite conditions hold.

28

Rules vs. Discretion

• Should a central bank have a specific policy rule?

• Rules may be explicit and mandated by law

– Money should grow at 4% per year (Friedman preferred rule).

• Rules may be implicit and known by all economic agents

– The Fed will target the inflation rate at 2-4% per year and 
Th F d ill
d
2 4%
i
h i fl
naturalunemployment rate.  

• The Fed uses a discretionary rule.  The members of the bank vote on a 
monetary policy at each meeting.  Policy is not dictated by some explicit rule.
29

Benefits of Rules

• If the Central Bank is committed to keep inflation under control…

• Inflation Temptation is powerless!

• Creates a more stable economic situation:  individuals and firms can 
anticipate the central bank actions.   No surprises!

• Discretion may help the Central Bank to be more flexible …

• BUT allows the Bank to think too much - the economy is so complex that 
Fed policy can have delayed impact and is usually initiated too late!  
Central Bank actions can often be ‘destabilizing’ (Freidman, Lucas:  both 
prefer simple rules)

30

The Taylor Rule

John Taylor of Stanford University said that the Fed’s behavior under Greenspan (1987-
2006) and Bernanke (today) is well-described by:

Taylor Rule: i = r* + πe + a *(πe π*) + a *(Y Y*)/Y*
Taylor Rule:  i   =  r* + πe + aπ*(πe - π*) + ay *(Y - Y*)/Y*

with aπ  + ay =1. In particular Taylor assumes aπ  = ay =.5.

i = the nominal federal funds rate 
r* = the real fed funds rate target (this is the r consistent with Y=Y*)
πe = expected inflation
π* = target inflation
Y = real GDP
Y* = potential real GDP 

(Y-Y*)/Y* is the output gap or GDP gap.  A positive output gap means overheating and 
potentially rising inflation (labor markets will demand higher wages).

Taylor used r* = 2%  and π* = 2%.  The Taylor Rule explains about 2/3 of quarterly 
variation in the fed funds rate since 1987.

31

Notes on the Taylor Rule

• This does NOT mean that Bernanke uses this ‘rule’, it is just that Fed behavior 
looks very similar to this rule.

• Furthermore, Fed tends to smooth interest rates relative to the Taylor Rule:

i  = .6*(last quarter’s actual i) + .4*(Taylor Rule i)

Studies have found that other G7 Central Banks (e.g., the Bundesbank)   have 
( g
)
•
also followed versions of a smoothed Taylor Rule

Hawks and Doves
• How does the Fed balance price stability ( =  *) and full employment (U = 
U*) when they conflict?  (when  >  * and U > U* at the same time)

• Hawks put more weight on  * (and have lower values for it):
– U.K., Canada, New Zealand.
U.K., Canada, New Zealand.
– Bundesbank before; European Central Bank now!

• Doves put more weight on staying near U* (and have higher  *)

• Greenspan and Bernanke tend to put the same “weight” on each
Greenspan and Bernanke tend to put the same  weight  on each

• Current Recession: unusual shock to y           for almost any weight, i goes to 0! 
(Liquidity Trap)

34

Did the Fed do something wrong?

• During the expansion after 2001, the economy did not seem to overheat, 
output was around potential Y* and inflation was stable

• However, at the same time, housing prices were rising steadily ….

• Greenspan did not do anything, according to the Taylor Rule: i should not 
change if output and inflation are around target.

•

Should the Fed have reacted to the housing bubble? Should the Taylor 
rule include asset prices (S)? 

i   =  r* + πe + aπ*(πe - π*) + ay *(Y - Y*)/Y* + aS *(S - S*)

B
NO!
• Bernanke and Gertler answer: NO!

35

Housing Bubble

• Bernanke and Gertler argument: 

•
•

•

the Fed should care about asset prices only if they have macro effects
if the housing bubble had macro effects you should see output or 
inflation react (standard demand shock)
but then standard Taylor rule would suffice

• However it seems that the hosing bubble had macro impact when it burst!
However, it seems that the hosing bubble had macro impact when it burst!

•

•

It could be that asset price bubbles are problematic because agents tend to 
leverage too much and then a crisis can occur if the bubble bursts
leverage too much and then a crisis can occur if the bubble bursts

Is monetary policy the right tool to control a bubble? Can you even do it?

36

Worries about Deflation

• Deflation can make borrowers - either consumers or firms, worse off.

• As we saw early in the course, unexpected inflation makes borrowers better 
off. They expected to pay a certain real rate and when inflation is higher and the 
nominal rate is fixed, the real rate they pay is lower

If the economy experiences unexpected deflation, the opposite happens:  
•
borrowers are paying more in terms of real purchasing power.
borrowers  are paying more in terms of real purchasing power.  

• Borrowers, both consumers and firms, will essentially be poorer (even though, 
there is another side of the market this could have large effects on C and I)
there is another side of the market, this could have large effects on C and I)

• This demand side effect of deflation is called ‘debt overhang’ or ‘debt 
deflation’ <<E en the go ernment pa s higher than e pected rates on their debt>>
deflation’. <<Even the government pays higher than expected rates on their debt>>
