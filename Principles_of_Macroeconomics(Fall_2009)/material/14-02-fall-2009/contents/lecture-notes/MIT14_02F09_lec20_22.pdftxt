 What is the exchange rate?

 NX back!! What is the link between the exchange rate and net 
exports?

 What is the trade deficit?

 How do different shocks affect the exchange rate and net exports?

Nominal exchange rates
The nominal exchange rate is the rate at which two currencies are 
exchanged!

Example: the nominal exchange rate between the US dollars and the Japanese 
Yen is 110 yen per dollar

It means that 1 dollar can buy 110 yen in the foreign exchange market (the 
market for international currencies)

•

•

•

• More technically:

The nominal exchange rate, enom, between two currencies is the number 
of units of foreign currency that can be purchased with 1 unit of 
domestic currencies.

3

Real Exchange Rates
If you know that enom = 110 yen, do you know if it is cheaper to leave 
in Japan or in the US?

•

• NO! You need more information about prices …

• The real exchange rate is the price of domestic goods relative to 
foreign goods

• More technically

The real exchange rate,  e, is the number of foreign goods that can 
be obtained in exchange for 1 unit of the domestic good:

e = (enom* P) / Pf

4

Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
• How are nominal and real exchange rates related?

•

Imagine two countries produce the same goods and goods are freely 
traded.

• Then trade is possible only if real exchange rates are equal to 1!

• PPP = the price of the domestic good must equal the price of the 
foreign good, in terms of the domestic currency:

P = Pf / enom  → enom = Pf / P

• Empirical evidence: PPP tends to hold in the long run, but not in the 
short run. Why? Different goods, non-traded goods, trade tariffs,…

5

Why does the real exchange rate matters?

• Real exchange rate represents the rate at which domestic goods (and services) 
can be traded for those produced abroad  (terms of trade)

• Why an increase in the real exchange matters?

1. people are able to obtain more foreign goods in exchange for a given 
amount of domestic goods

2. Net export is going to be lower (substitution effect!)

•

Example: US cars costs twice as much as a Japanese cars. Then Americans 
a p e: US ca s cos s w ce as
uc as a Japa ese ca s.
e
e ca s
will demand more Japanese cars, so import will increase. Japanese will 
demand less US cars, so export decrease. It follows that NX decrease!

• Real exchange rate is the relative price of a country’s good. If it 
increases, people will switch towards other countries’ goods.

6

Real exchange rate decreases: J curve

NX

time

Japanese cars are more expensive than US ones.
Substitution effect can take time to kick in …
On Impact: Americans import the same amount of Japanese cars, but they are more 
expensive. Then, the nominal value of import increases and NX decreases
Later: American stop importing Japanese cars and NX increases.
From now on assume that a decrease of e increases NX!

7

Different exchange rate systems

•

•

In a flexible (or floating) exchange rate system, exchange rates are 
determined by demand and supply in the foreign exchange market
y
pp y
g
g

In a fixed exchange rate system, exchange rates are set at officially 
predetermined levels. The central bank commits to buy and sell its own 
currency at that rate (e.g. gold standard, Bretton Woods)

• We focus on flexible exchange rate system and think about two 
countries: the domestic (US) and the foreign country (Japan)

•

•

I refer always to the nominal exchange rate, when I do not specify otherwise

Increase in the real exchange rate = appreciation (revaluation in peg system)

• Decrease in the real exchange rate = depreciation (devaluation in peg 
system)

8

How is the exchange rate determined?

Value of dollars

Demand of dollars

Supply of dollars

Dollars traded

Number of dollars

Nominal exchange rate = value of the dollar (yen/dollars)

9

Demand and Supply
Supply for dollars is upward-sloping: when the value of the dollar is higher (you get 
a lot of yen for 1 dollar), then people supply more dollars

Demand for dollars is downward-sloping: when the value of the dollar is higher 
(you have to pay a lot of yen to get 1 dollar), then people demand  less dollars

The amount of dollars traded in equilibrium and the equilibrium exchange rate is 
determined by the intersection of demand and supply (as in any market!)

•

•

•

• Why do Japanese demand dollars? 
1. To buy US goods and services (US exports)
2. To buy US real and financial assets (US financial inflows)

• Why do Americans supply dollars (to get yen)? 
1. To buy Japanese goods and services (US imports)
2. To buy Japanese real and financial assets (US financial outflows)

dollar may appreciate or depreciate (we assume the second!)

Trade Balance

• Trade balance = NX.

•

i
If trade balance is positive, we say there is a trade surplus.  If trade balance is 
If t d b l
l
t d
i
If t d b l
i
iti
th
negative, we say there is a trade deficit.

• When the real exchange rate appreciates, the value of the dollar is higher. 
Hence, domestic exports are more expensive (for Japanese) and imports are 
cheaper (for Americans). 

• Other things constant, a real exchange rate appreciation reduces NX

•

In other words, if the dollar appreciates, we would expect the trade surplus 
to fall (trade deficit to rise).  If the dollar appreciates, imports will increase 
and exports will fall.

22

Current Account
The current account balance equals payment received from abroad in 
exchange for currently produced goods and services minus analogous 
payments made to foreigners by the domestic economy
p y
g
y
y

Three components:

•

•

1) net exports of goods and services
2) net income from abroad (mainly interest payments on net asset positions)
3) net unilateral transfers

• When a current account balance is negative (as in the US since 1980s), US 
g
(
),
receipts of payment from foreigners are not sufficient to cover US payments 
to foreigners

• Hence, US has to borrow from foreigners or sell to foreigners some US assets

23

Global Imbalances
• Current Account is equal to NX + other stuff

Us all other st ff is relati el small so se CA ≈ NX
• Usually other stuff is relatively small so use CA ≈ NX

• Crucial identity: trade in assets compensates for trade in goods

•

If we buy more foreign goods than we sell, we must sell more assets than we 
buy

• United States: current CA deficit about 4% of GDP

• Always 2 sides of a CA deficit: a portfolio side and an import/export side!

24

Global Imbalances

25

Are Global Imbalances to Blame?
• One story:

•

Emerging economies want to accumulate safe assets:
g g

1. Demographics/Lack of Social Insurance
2
Protection for capital flights
2. Protection for capital flights

•

They buy US Treasuries (CA deficit increases) pushing down interest rates

• Banks search for yield: increase demand for AAA-rated assets with 
higher returns (MBS,…)

•

This saw the seeds for the current crisis

• Bernanke recognized the imbalances in 2005 (but not the crisis 
unfortunately!)

26

Low saving rates before the crisis

In the 4 years before the crisis, the US has experienced 
low interest rates and low savings. 

What explains this?

a. Can the negative wealth effect of the stock market crash explain this?

b
Can the positive wealth effect of the real estate boom explain this?
b. Can the positive wealth effect of the real estate boom explain this? 

c. What about China???

d. What about the  Fed ? …

Two views (and my comments)

1. Sachs: who really made interest rates low is the Fed, not Asian countries, 
so the Fed is to blame 

BUT
•
•

but the Fed objective is to keep Y=Y* if there is no inflation
So the Fed was right to keep r low if NX drops! 

2. Krugman: the problem of the story is that bankers are greedy

Open-Economy IS-LM Model
LM not affected

FE not affected

IS affected by NX!! Still downward sloping: as r increases, e appreciates 
and NX decreases!
and NX  decreases!

•

•

•

• Remember: in an open economy, the good market equilibrium is now

Y = C + I + G + NX
or
S – I = NX

•

The excess of national savings over investment is the amount US residents
The excess of national savings over investment is the amount US residents 
want to lend abroad and net export is the amount that foreigners (Japanese) 
want to borrow from US.

International Transmission of the Business Cycle

and NX is one of the principal reason why cycles are transmitted 
internationally

If US is in recession, Japan net export decrease and a negative demand shock 
can generate a recession!

Let’s see now the effect of fiscal and monetary policies when US is an 
open economy …

Monetary Policy in Open Economy
• With an expansionary monetary policy, r decreases and P and Y increases.   
All of these increase the supply for dollars and decrease the demand for 
dollars
dollars

• The dollar depreciates!

• Dollar depreciation decreases imports and increase exports (NX increase)

•

•

•
•

In an open economy, AD will shift out further than it does in a closed 
economy  (because of I and NX!) + the IS shifts to the right!

In the short run, the monetary policy is more effective in an open economy.  

In the long run money is still neutral!!!
In the long run, money is still neutral!!!

Fiscal Policy in Open Economy

•

Suppose the US government increases G or decreases T.  How will this affect 
goods market, money market, labor market and exchange rate market?

• G increases, hence demand for goods increases

• Demand for goods increases and firms rise prices and real money supply 
decreases  (+ money demand increases), increasing the interest rate

not predict any change in their PVLR)

If the interest rate effect dominates, the dollar appreciates, and NX will 
unambiguously decrease!

International crowding out : in an open economy, the increase in imports 
crowds out some of the effects of expansionary fiscal policy.

• Hence, the fiscal policy is less effective in the short run!
