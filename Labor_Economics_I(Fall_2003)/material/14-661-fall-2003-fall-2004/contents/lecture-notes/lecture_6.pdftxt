1 Introduction

A core topic in labor economics is ‘self-selection.’ What this term means in theory is that

rational actors make optimizing decisions about what markets to participate in — job, location,

education, marriage, crime, etc. What it means in practice is that observed economic relation-

ships should generally be viewed as endogenous outcomes of numerous optimizing decisions,

rather than as exogenous causal relationships. Understanding self-selection should make you

skeptical of treating ecological correlations as causal.

The starting point of formal treatment of this topic in economics is Roy’s (1951) “Thoughts

on the Distribution of Earnings,” which discusses the optimizing choices of ‘workers’ selecting

between ﬁshing and hunting. Roy’s key observation is that there are three factors that aﬀect

this choice:

1. Fundamental distribution of skills and abilities

2. The correlations among these skills in the population

3. The technologies for applying these skills

4. Consumer tastes that impact demand for diﬀerent types of outputs

At the time of Roy’s writing, the presumption was that the distribution of income that arises

from economic processes is arbitrary. Hence, if we compare the mean earnings of hunters and
ﬁshermen, ¯yh and ¯yf , then ¯yh− ¯yf is an estimate of the earnings gain or loss that an individual
would receive from switching from ﬁshing to hunting. Roy’s article explains why this view is

incorrect.

The essential departure of Roy’s model from previous work is that it is a multiple-index

model (in this case, 2 indices): workers have skills in each occupation, but they can only

use one skill or the other. Hence, workers self-select the sector that gives them the highest

expected earnings. Equilibrium in each market equates supply and demand, while a self-

selection condition means that the marginal worker is indiﬀerent between the two sectors.

Roy’s 1951 paper is amusing to read to a contemporary economist because it so awkwardly

straddles the line between older-style narrative economics and modern mathematical economics.

2

Roy is clearly writing with equations and distributions in mind (probably all written out), but

he writes mostly about rabbits and ﬁsh — only occasionally interjecting that ‘therefore’ earnings

will be log-normal. This is very hard to follow. Borjas’ 1987 AER Paper on “Self-Selection and

the Earnings of Immigrants” is the ﬁrst paper that I know that writes down a simple, parametric

2-sector Roy model. The enduring contribution of Borjas’ paper is this model (sometimes called

a Borjas selection model) rather than the empirical ﬁndings. As a labor economist, you should

be well versed with this model.

2 Borjas 1987: Self-Selection and the Earnings of Immigrants

Who chooses to immigrate to the United States? One ready-made answer is that workers from

low wage countries will immigrate. This may be true on average, but it’s probably too simple.

The workers immigrating to the United States are probably not a random subset of the Mexican

workforce. Rather, we should expect that potential migrants make some rough comparison of

their wages in the home country and their expected wages in the U.S. On average, we’d expect

those who immigrate to have higher expected earnings in the U.S. than Mexico and vice versa

for those who stay.

• Consider two countries 0 and 1, denoting the source and host country.
• Log earnings in the source country are given by

w0 = µ0 + ε0 ,

where ε0 ∼ N (0, σ2
0 ) . It’s useful to think of εo as the de-meaned value of worker’s ‘skill’
in the source country.

• If everyone from country 0 were to migrate to the host country, their earnings would be
(ignoring any general equilibrium eﬀects!):

where ε1 ∼ N (0, σ2
1 ) .

w1 = µ1 + ε1 ,

3

• Assume that the cost of migrating is C , which Borjas puts into ‘time equivalent’ terms
as π = C/w0 . Borjas further assumes that π is constant, meaning that C is directly
proportional to w0 .

• Assume further that each worker knows C, µ0 , µ1 and his individual epsilons: ε0 , ε1 .
• You, the econometrician, only observe a worker in one country or the other, and hence
you only know ε0 or ε1 for any individual.

• What can you infer about what wages for immigrants in the United States would have
been had they stayed in their source countries? What would wages in the United States

be for non-migrants had they come to the United States? The Roy Model answers these

questions.

• The correlation between source and host country earnings is
σ01
,
ρ =
σ0σ1

where σ01 is cov(σ0 , σ1 ) .

• To implement this model, we need to know ρ, although we do not need to know both
ε0 , ε1 for any worker.

• A worker will choose to migrate if
(µ1 − µ0 − π) + (ε1 − ε0 ) > 0,
(Borjas deﬁnes the indicator variable I , equal to 1 if this selection condition is satisﬁed,

(1)

0 otherwise).

• Now, deﬁne ν = ε1 − ε0 . The probability that a randomly chosen worker from the source
country chooses to migrate is equal to

where z = (µ0 − µ1 + π) /σν , and Φ (·) is the CDF of the standard normal. Notice
that the higher larger is z , the lower is the probability of migration. This is because

z is rising in the mean earnings of the home country and the cost of migration. So

∂P /∂µ0 < 0, ∂P /∂µ1 > 0, ∂P /∂π < 0.

• These are mean eﬀects. It’s useful to assume from here forward that µ1 ≈ µ0 , so we can
focus on self-selection rather than mean diﬀerences.

• Let’s examine the self-selection properties.
2.1 Selection conditions

• What is the expectation of earnings in the source country for workers who choose to
immigrate?

• Notice that this equation depends on three things:
1. Mean earnings in the source country

2. Both error terms (ε0 , ε1 ) through ν .

3. Implicitly, it also depends on the correlation between the error terms.

• We want to know the expectation of ε0 given some value ν . Given the normality of ε0 , ε1 ,
this is simply equal to the regression coeﬃcient

E (ε0 |ν ) =

Notice that due to the normalizations, the covariance cov(ε0 , ε1 ) is reduced by 1/σ0σ1
and the variance of ν /σν is 1.

• Hence, we can rewrite (2) as

where φ (z ) / (1 − Φ (z)) is the Inverse Mills Ratio, equal to the conditional expectation
of a standard normal random variable truncated from the left at point z . The IMR is

(3)

sometimes referred to as a ‘hazard ratio.’ This is because a hazard function answers

the question ‘what is the probability of an event given that the event has not already

occurred.’ Similarly, the IMR answers the question: what is the expectation of epsilon

given that epsilon is greater than or equal to z?

• We can calculate the expected wage in the source country of workers who do migrate as:

= µ0 + ρ0ν σ0 µ φ (z)

So, this substitution works.]

• Deﬁne Q0 = E (ε0 |I = 1) , Q1 = E (ε1 |I = 1). We now have three cases:

7

2.2.1 Positive hierarchical sorting

• This is a case where immigrants are positively selected from the source country distribu-
tion and are also above the mean of the host country distribution: Q0 > 0, Q1 > 0. This
will be true iﬀ

> 1 and ρ >

σ1
σ0
• What do these conditions mean? First, σ1

σ1
between the skills valued in the host and source country is suﬃciently high. If you were

.

a skilled worker in the source country, you would not want to migrate to a host country

with a very high return to skills if the skills valued in the host country were uncorrelated

(or negatively correlated) with skills value in the home country.

• This case embodies the canonical American view of immigration:
brightest’ leave their home countries for greater opportunity (that is, higher return to

‘The best and the

skill) in the U.S.

• One way of restating this type of migration is: a source country with low earnings variance
‘taxes’ the earnings of high skill workers and insures the earnings of low skill workers. High

skill workers may want to emigrate, accordingly. But this is not the only possibility.

2.2.2 Negative hierarchical sorting

• This is a case where immigrants are negative selected from the source country distribution
and are also below the average of the host country distribution: Q0 < 0, Q1 < 0. This
will be true iﬀ

σ0
σ1

σ0
• This is simply the converse case. Here, the source country is unattractive to low earnings
workers because of high wage dispersion. Again assuming that wages are suﬃciently

> 1 and ρ >

.

correlated between the source and host country, low skill workers will want to migrate

8

to take advantage of the ‘insurance’ provided by a narrow wage structure in the host

country.

• So, this is the potentially unattractive case (certainly from Borjas’ perspective) where a
compressed wage structure ‘subsidizes’ low skill workers, thus attracting low skill workers

from abroad.

2.2.3 ‘Refugee’ sorting

• A third case is where Q0 < 0, Q1 > 0, that is, immigrants are selected from the lower
tail of the home country distribution but arrive in the upper tail of the host country
distribution. This can only occur if
σ1 ¶ ,
ρ < min µ σ1
σ0
σ0
meaning that the correlation between earnings in the two countries is suﬃciently low

,

(could be negative).

• This might occur, for example, for a minority group whose opportunities in the host
country are depressed by prejudice. Or for the case of migration from a non-market

economy where the set of skills rewarded is quite diﬀerent from the economy in the

receiving country (e.g., European Jews in the ﬁrst case, intellectuals from the former

Communist block in the second).

2.2.4 A fourth case?

• Note that there is not a fourth case where Q0 > 0, Q1 < 0. Why not? This would suggest
irrational migration, where people leave the upper tail of the source country income

distribution to join the lower tail of the host country distribution. This is inconsistent

with income maximization.

• Mathematically, this case would require that
σ1 ¶ ,
ρ > max µ σ1
σ0
σ0
which would imply that ρ > 1, which cannot be true for a correlation coeﬃcient.

3 Relevance?

• How relevant is the Borjas/Roy selection model to the problem he studies in the 1987 pa-
per, self-selection of immigrants? The evidence is not overwhelming. There are probably

more relevant applications of this model.

1. One is Borjas’ recent NBER paper on self-selection into government employment in

the U.S. Though the returns to skills/education rose rapidly in the U.S. during the

1980s, the wage structure in government jobs was stable, meaning that in relative

terms, the public sector wage structure became compressed. You would therefore

expect a negative hierarchical sorting case to become potentially relevant: high skill

workers leave the government for the private sector and low skill workers remain

in government jobs to be sheltered from falling wages. This is what Borjas’ paper

purports to show, and casual empiricism suggests that this is likely to be right.

2. A closely related application, but one I’ve not applied, is the changing selection of

workers into the teaching profession. The teaching profession probably used to of-

fer relatively high ‘returns to skills’ for educated women. For many women, it was

the only profession open. This has changed considerably in the U.S. Teaching now

probably provides a high ﬂoor and a low ceiling for wages for college educated fe-

males. This would suggest growing adverse selection into teaching over time. Worth

exploring.

• The enduring contribution of Borjas’ paper for labor economists is its simple and useful
formulation of the Roy model. (Note that one limitation of this model is that it ignores

general equilibrium eﬀects whereby large immigrant ﬂows would actually change the wage

structure parameters in the source and host countries.)

• The growing focus of empirical economists on applying instrumental variables to causal
estimation is in large part a response to the realization that self-selection (i.e., optimizing

behavior) plagues interpretation of ecological relationships. Hence, understanding the

importance of self-selection has vastly improved empirical work.

10

• But instrumental variables are not the only answer to testing cause and eﬀect with ob-
served data. Self-selection also points to the existence of equilibrium relationships that

should be observed in ecological data (i.e., those who immigrate should in general do

better in the host country than the source country), and these can be tested without an

instrument. In fact, there are some natural sciences that proceed almost entirely without

experimentation — for example, astrophysics. How do they do it? Models predict non-

obvious relationships in data. These implications can be veriﬁed or refuted by data, and

this evidence strengthens or overturns the hypotheses. Many economists seem to have

forgotten this methodology.
