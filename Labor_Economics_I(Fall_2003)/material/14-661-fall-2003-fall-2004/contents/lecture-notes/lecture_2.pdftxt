1 Agenda

We’ve so far discussed general human capital, but ‘speciﬁc capital’ ﬁgures prominently in

Becker’s original Human Capital theory and in empirical and theoretical work on this topic. It’s

trivial to add speciﬁc capital to our stylized model, and we’ll do this in a moment. But whether

speciﬁc capital truly exists and whether it’s important component of wage determination is still

a sub ject of debate. This lecture will explore the theory and empirics of speciﬁc capital. The

agenda is:

1. Adding speciﬁc capital to our two period training model.

• A general stochastic approach
• A contracting and observability approach: Speciﬁc capital is a bilateral holdup prob-
lem

2. Empirical evidence on the importance of speciﬁc capital.

• Non-experimental approaches
• Quasi-experimental evidence
3. Speciﬁc capital as general capital — a market thickness interpretation (Lazaer, 2003, NBER

Working Paper)

2 Adding specific capital to the two period training model

• In our stylized model two period, it’s easy to add speciﬁc capital to the equation.
• If we rewrote our productivity and outside wage functions, f (·) and ν (·) , each with two
arguments, g , and s for general and speciﬁc training, we would have the following:

y = f (g , s) with f1 (g , s) > 0 and f2 (g , s) > 0,

w = ν (g , s) with ν 1 (g , s) > 0 and ν 2 (g , s) = 0.

Since speciﬁc capital in its canonical form has only one buyer, the outside wage cannot

rise with speciﬁc capital accumulation.

2

• Does this mean that the worker’s wage will not rise with speciﬁc capital accumulation?
Clearly, there is a contracting problem here. Speciﬁc capital investment generates a ﬂow

of quasi-rents, and it’s not clear to whom they should accrue. If either party severs the

relationship, both lose the ﬂow of rents. So, this is typically a case where some form of

Nash Bargaining seems plausible.

• Here’s one way to think about it: Worker departures are stochastic — determined in part
by exogenous shocks that increase the worker’s outside opportunity. Examples might

include (idiosyncratic) wage oﬀers, life events, spousal job opportunities, etc. The higher

the wage the worker receives relative to their outside opportunity, the lower the likelihood

that the worker will leave in response to an exogenous shock. Since the ﬁrm earns quasi-

rents on the workers speciﬁc capital, which are lost if the worker leaves, the ﬁrm may ﬁnd

it optimal to share some of these rents with the worker.

• More speciﬁcally, write the PDF of the worker’s exogenous shock function as h (z ) where
z represents the monetized value of outside opportunities that arise randomly in period 2.

Workers depart in period 2 if they receive a shock z that exceeds their wage w. Now, the

ﬁrm’s maximization problem for wages — taking speciﬁc capital as given for convenience

and ignoring general capital — becomes

(π |s) = H (w) [f (s) − w] ,
where H (·) is the CDF of z . So, if the ﬁrm paid w = zmax , no worker would ever quit.
The FOC becomes

max
w

h (w∗ ) [f (s) − w∗ ] − H (w∗ ) = 0.
It’s clear that even though v2 (g , s) = 0, the ﬁrm will optimally choose w∗ > 0, which
implies that ∂w/∂ s > 0.

• So, it’s not hard to generate the implication that wages should rise with speciﬁc capital
investment. But this leaves two questions unanswered:

1. Is such speciﬁc capital investment occurring?

3

2. Do these investments raise wages in practice as theory suggests they might?

• Truth be told, we’ll never answer the ﬁrst question. But if we could prove that job tenure
causes wages to rise, we might take this as evidence that speciﬁc capital investment is

occurring.

• How do we test this? We’ll come to that in a minute
2.1 A contracting approach: Prendergast (1993, QJE)

• If you believe in the idea of speciﬁc capital, there is a hold up problem, and it’s worse
than in the case of general human capital. As Prendergast, points out, this is a ‘dual hold

up problem:’

— The ﬁrm has an incentive to renege on any wage commitment once the worker has

sunk a speciﬁc capital investment.

— Recognizing this, the worker has an incentive not to obtain these skills in the ﬁrst

place.

— (Note the assumption is that the worker bears the psychic cost.)

— So again, contracting problems and skills investments decisions are linked.

• This problem is severe in the case of speciﬁc capital because speciﬁc capital is arguably ‘ob-
servable’ but not ‘veriﬁable.’ That is, a ﬁrm and a worker can plausibly observe whether

a worker has obtained speciﬁc capital, but a court could not verify this information.

• So we must consider the set of contracts that are self-enforcing, that is, where commit-
ments are enforced by subgame perfect mechanisms after training investments sunk.

• The details of this model are quite straightforward. I’ll just sketch the simplest version
given in the intro of the paper:

1. A risk neutral worker with reservation utility r is employed in a risk neutral ﬁrm for

a single period.

4

2. r must be earned in expectation in both periods.

3. Worker can be assigned to one of two jobs, Easy or Diﬃcult: D or E .

4. Before job assignment, a worker can acquire speciﬁc skills s = {0, 1} .
5. Worker utility is U = w − sc, where w is the wage and c is the psychic cost of
acquiring speciﬁc skills.

• Will the ﬁrm be able to induce the worker to acquire s?
— If the ﬁrm promises a higher wage conditional on skill acquisition, is promise credible?

— If the worker committed to acquire skills in exchange for up front payment in 1st

period, is this committment credible?

— So, there is no simple feasible contract here, even if skills acquisition is eﬃcient.

• Now, assume that the ﬁrm can commit to wages as a function of job tasks (D or E ). Why
is this commitment credible? Presumably, actual job assignment/tasks are veriﬁable by

a third party, although speciﬁc capital is not.

• We need a key assumption now: task D is diﬀerentially sensitive to speciﬁc capital in-
vestment s. More restrictively, let yi (s) be output as a function of job assignment and
speciﬁc skill. We want

yD (0) < yE (0) < yE (1) < yD (1) .

This implies that:

1. Training is productive in both jobs (actually, this is not necessary — in fact, it makes

the problem less likely to have a solution.)

2. Eﬃcient assignment requires that trained workers go to job D.

• Assuming ﬁrms can commit to a wage schedule associated with job assignment, then they
will promote workers iﬀ:

yD (1) − wD ≥ yE (1) − wE ,

5

and workers will train if

wD − wE ≥ c.
Putting these together, the two-sided holdup is solved if yD (1) − yE (1) ≥ wD − wE ≥ c.
• Note a nice subtlety. If training is eﬃcient, this implies that yD (1) − yD (0) ≥ c. But this
does not imply that yD (1) − yD (1) ≥ c. In other words, once the worker is trained, it’s
not clear that the ﬁrm would be willing to reimburse her the cost of training in exchange

for doing the more diﬃcult job.

• Hence, there is still a strong incentive for appropriation, and this tendency constrains
the set of feasible contracts. It’s plausible that no speciﬁc capital investment will occur

in equilibrium, even if this investment is eﬃcient. I don’t think there is any case in this

setup where speciﬁc capital investment will occur where it should not.

• The rest of the paper formalizes this set of insights.
• What is useful here?
1. Useful exposition of the two-sided hold up problem; shows that it will probably not

have a solution that is both eﬃcient and feasible.

2. Endogenizes the idea of ‘a job.’ Economists have little to say about why job titles

exist and why wages are attached to them directly (see Baker, Gibbs and Holmstrom,

QJE, 1994). This paper provides one possible explanation for why ﬁrms would use

this policy. See Gibbons and Waldman, QJE, 1999, for a rich elaboration of related

ideas.

3. Also shows when the necessary conditions are unlikely to be met. Titles cannot be

purely nominal in this model; ﬁrm must directly beneﬁt from assignment of workers

to new tasks (why?). This model would not be relevant in a setting where every

worker at a ﬁrm did the same job (academics, lawyers). In this case, speciﬁc capital

investment must occur (if at all) for alternative reasons (e.g., up or out contracts).

6

• Can the Prendergast model be linked to our omnibus model of incentives for human
capital investment? (Yes, draw a diagram)

2.2 Evidence for a tenure effect on wages

• See column (1) of Tables 4a and 4b of Abraham and Farber (AER, 1987).
• The OLS estimated return to experience is 3.5 log points, and the OLS return to tenure
(net of experience) is an additional 1.1 log points. If this latter point estimate is causal

and half of the tenure return is shared between workers and ﬁrms, then the true value of

speciﬁc capital investment is 2.2 log points, or two thirds at large as the value of general

human capital accumulation. That’s big!

• The ‘tenure eﬀect’ was historically been interpreted as evidence of accumulation of ﬁrm
‘speciﬁc human capital.’ What is the source of identiﬁcation for these comparisons?

Comparison of endogenous stayers versus endogenous movers.

• Possible interpretations of the ‘tenure eﬀect:’
1. Return on speciﬁc human capital

2. High wage jobs last longer — so there will be composition bias in cross-sectional

estimates

3. More able workers tend to keep their jobs longer — also will yield composition bias

• What are the testable implications of these three views:
1. Return on speciﬁc human capital: High tenure workers who are exogenously sepa-

rated from their current employer will have earnings losses.

2. High tenure workers who are exogenously separated from their current employer will

have earnings losses. BUT these jobs were high wage at the start. So even low tenure

workers would also have substantial job losses.

3. More able workers tend to keep their jobs longer. No earnings loss in this case — it’s

a return to ability.

7

• How have economists attempted to sort this out?
2.3 Abraham and Farber (1987)

• This was quite an inﬂuential paper.
• It might also helpfully remind you — or inform you if you never knew — how economists were
thinking about identiﬁcation and IV problems prior to the current era of transparency.

It’s all about epsilons and correlations among disturbances rather than anything about

exogenous variation. By the standards of its day, this paper was at the frontier.

• Abraham and Farber want to tackle the composition bias problem posited above: high
wage jobs last longer and so the returns to tenure from an OLS will be averaging over

short-low-wage jobs and long-high-wage jobs. This will make it appear that longer tenure

gives rise to high wages, when if we could look back in time, we would ﬁnd that the high

tenure jobs were high wage from the get-go.

• It seems that one could actually investigate this implication directly using panel data:
taking the cross-section of job spells originating in period t, is the case that those jobs

unexpectedly high wages in t have a greater probability of lasting to t + 1? But this is

not their approach.

• They note that:
— In the cross-section, we should be observing workers at the mid-point of their current

employment spells.

— So, if we had data on the starting point of jobs, we could predict their eventual

completed length using their length up to the present. In other words, we could

instrument for eventual length using current length. [Note the distinction between

maximum likelihood and frequentist estimation here...]

— Then, we could control for predicted completed length in a regression of wages on

experience and tenure.

8

— The composition bias hypothesis would predict that eventual length rather than

current length would explain high wages in high tenure jobs.

— Better still, if we knew ultimate length, we could control for that directly.

— In fact, AF do a combination of the two since they have completed spell length in

their data for a ma jority of jobs.

• Incidentally, when they run the current tenure S as a function of completed tenure D,
they obtain

R2 = 0.61 ,
so the expectation is generally right but statistically far from perfect. In fact, current

Sij t = −2.24+ 0.534 · Dj
(.18)
(.007)

spells are more than 1/2 way complete on average.

• Their main results are seen in Tables 4a and 4b. Once they control for expected or actual
completed tenure, the contemporaneous return to tenure is essentially zero (positive for

white collar, inﬁnitesimal for blue collar).

• The ReStud paper by Altonji and Shakotko (1987) does something similar in spirit and
reaches a similar conclusion.

2.4 Topel, 1991, JPE

• In reading these papers, one wonders if their IV strategies are ‘biased’ by design in the
direction of attributing wage growth to things other than tenure.
In general, instru-

menting one covariate will aﬀect the estimates of other covariates if there is correlated

measurement error. If ﬁnal tenure is purged of measurement error by the IV strategy but

contemporaneous tenure is not, it’s plausible that much of the wage variation will load

on the better measured variable, i.e., ﬁnal rather than current tenure. If we overestimate

the return to ﬁnal tenure, we have to underestimate the return to current tenure.

• For neither the ﬁrst nor last time in his career, Robert Topel rides in on the JPE to
rescue the neoclassical model. In this case, the title says it all: “Wages Rise with Job

Seniority.”

9

• Table 1 of Topel’s paper has a ma jor intraocular impact. Of our three explanations for
the empirical link between tenure and earnings

— return on speciﬁc human capital;

— high wage jobs last longer;

— more able workers tend to keep their jobs longer,

...only the ﬁrst two now appear appear plausible. The earnings loss associated with

job loss is strongly increasing in seniority. So this cannot just be heterogeneity in

skill that is carried from job to job.

• [One question not answered: Is Topel somehow imputing a low log earning number for
workers who have not yet found reemployment? This would substantially change the

interpretation.]

• Topel’s idea:
1. Let’s look at real wage growth within jobs.

2. With some further assumptions, this growth can be interpreted as a convex combi-

nation of returns to experience and returns to tenure.

3. Now, attempt a decomposition to ﬁnd a lower bound on the share of this growth

that is explained by tenure.

• Write the model

• Rewrite the error term as

yij t = β 1Expij t + β 2T enureij t + εij t .

(1)

εij t = φij t + µi + ν j t ,

µ is not a ma jor concern since a person speciﬁc eﬀect can be diﬀerenced away. ν is also

not a concern if it’s a market wide phenomenon — we can get it with time eﬀects.

10

• The main concern for identiﬁcation is that φij t is some measure of ‘match quality’ that is
correlated with Exp and T enure. Speciﬁcally, write the auxiliary regression

φij t = b1Expij t + b2T enureij t + υ ij t .

(2)

OLS estimates of (1) will yield E ˆβ 1 = β 1 + b1 , E ˆβ 2 = β 2 + b2 . So, if high tenure jobs
are due to better matches — i.e., higher wages from the outset — then ˆβ 2 will be biased
upward.

• Topel has an extensive discussion rooted in search theory of whether we should in fact
expect that b2 > 0. He makes the points that:

— Given stochastic arrival, good job oﬀers will cumulate with labor market experience.

— If tenure really does increase earnings (β 2 > 0 in (1)) then workers will only switch
to jobs that compensate them for foregone returns to tenure (i.e., when a new job

with, by deﬁnition, zero tenure but high φ come along).

— In this case, the OLS returns to tenure will be biased downward. Why? The tenure

coeﬃcient in a wage regression compares movers to stayers:
∗ Stayers: Some workers who would have left due to the arrival of a higher φ will
stay due to β 2 , meaning that observed within-job wage growth among stayers is
dampened relative to movers. We don’t get to see their actual loss of the wage

beneﬁts of tenure because they don’t move.
∗ Movers: Those who do move will only do so in response to really good wage
oﬀers. This will raise the estimated return to experience instead of the return

to tenure.
∗ Hence, by both arguments, E (y |X, T + 1) − E (y |X, T ) < β 2 . This is clever.
• Implementation of the 2 stage estimator: We observe that
yij t − yij t−1 = β 1 + β 2 + εij t − εij t−1 .
Notice that this β 1 , β 2 are not separately identiﬁed in a standard regression — just their
sum — since Exp and T enure increase by the same amount in each year (∆EX P =

(3)

∆T EN U RE = 1 in each year).

11

• If we had an extraneous, unbiased estimate of ˜β 1 , the return to experience, then we could
calculate ˜β 2 = (β 1 + β 2 ) − ˜β 1 .
• Topel proposes to use the estimated return to prior experience at the start of a job as an
estimator of ˜β 1 . So

ij t = ˜β 1X 0
y0
ij t + ω ij t .

This estimator may not be entirely free of bias due to matching considerations, but
by the arguments above, it will overstate the return to experience if β 2 > 0. Hence,
˜β 2 = (β 1 + β 2 ) − ˜β 1 should put a lower bound on the return to tenure.
• So, this is pretty much rabbit-out-of-a-hat kind of technique. You didn’t see it coming,
but once the rabbit is there, it seems real enough.

• Without belaboring the details, Table 2 gives estimates of the combined β 1 + β 2 from
equation (3) .

• Applying estimates of ˜β 1 to the Table 2 results yields Table 3, which shows very large
returns to tenure indeed. In fact, they are on the same order of the Table 1 results —

which implies (under this model) that there is little bias in the cross-sectional returns to

tenure.

• Much more follows, but it doesn’t change this basic story.
• This is an impressive paper, well worth understanding from an econometric standpoint.
There is lots of sensible, well exposited technique in this paper, and you would be wise

to spend some time mastering it.

• Topel also carefully replicates and critiques both Altonji and Shakotko and Abraham and
Farber. This is what good labor economists are supposed to do. This paper represents

the best of a labor tradition that is less commonplace now than 10 years ago. A shame.

12

2.5 Jacobson, LaLonde and Sullivan (AER, 1993)

• But to many economists, Topel’s paper would appear too clever by half. It is clearly
devastating to its competition. But to many skeptics, no amount of savvy econometric

manipulation is going to stand in for a good experiment.

• Jacobson, LaLande and Sullivan’s 1993 AER paper ﬁnds this experiment. They explore
the value of speciﬁc capital with data on job losses for high tenure workers from distressed

ﬁrms in Pennsylvania in the 1980s.

• This paper is quite far ahead of its time. The techniques used are very familiar to
contemporary labor economists — so much so that I won’t really discuss them — but that

was not true in 1993. You should be certain you understand everything they are doing.

• JLS Figure 1
• Key ﬁndings:
— Displaced workers relative earnings begin to decline almost 3 years prior to job loss

— They drop by almost 50% in quarter of loss

— Rise rapidly over 6 quarters

— Then level out at 25% below pre-displacement earnings

• Huge, clear cut.
• Critiques. (See Table 2: Primary metals).
2.6 The Lazaer critique of the concept of ‘specific capital.’

• Could speciﬁc capital plausibly be as important to earnings growth as is experience?
(Remember that returns are shared between worker and ﬁrm — implying that OLS returns

to tenure understate the productivity of speciﬁc capital).

• An alternative interpretation: ‘Market thickness.’ Speciﬁc capital as a case of the thinnest
possible market — one buyer.

13

• Worker has a vector of skills, not all of which are equally productive at every ﬁrm.
• Think of wage as inner product of worker’s skills and ﬁrm’s weights on those skills.
• Then the ‘tenure’ eﬀect is a function of:
— Diﬀerence between value that incumbent and new ﬁrm places on these skills

— This in turn aﬀected by worker’s investment decisions among skills

— A function itself of probability of job separation

— And distribution of weights at other ﬁrms

2.7 Small model (Lazaer)

• 2 periods, 2 skills
• Workers invest in period 1, receive returns in period 2
• Two skills A and B that worker can acquire at cost C (A, B ) .
• Worker with skill set {A, B} has potential earnings at ﬁrm i of
yi = λiA + (1 − λi)B ,

where λi ∈ [0, 1] .
• Let probability of staying into period 2 be ρ.
• Let density of λ be f (λ).
• Worker employed at ﬁrm 1 chooses A, B to maximize
= ρ [λ1A + (1 − λ1 )B ] + (1 − ρ) Z 1
[λA + (1 − λ)B ] f (λ) dλ − C (A, B ),
max
A,B
0
with FOCs

ρλ1 + (1 − ρ)¯λ − CA = 0,
ρ (1 − λ1 ) + (1 − ρ) ¡1 − ¯λ¢ − CB = 0.
14

• Let A∗ , B ∗ solve this problem. Investment is a weighted average of relevant skill-weights
inside ﬁrm and outside, where weights depend on probability of separation and distribu-

tion of outside opportunities. Notice that if ρ = 1, investment only depends on λ1 .

• Can calculate a stylized ‘tenure eﬀect.’
• Wages in period 1 are assumed 0.
• Wages of stayers are

y1 = λ1A∗ + (1 − λ1 )B ∗ .

• Wages of leavers are

y2 = λ2A∗ + (1 − λ2 )B ∗ .
• Tenure coeﬃcient is that part of wage growth that is not common to stayers and leavers:
∆ = λ1A∗ + (1 − λ1)B ∗ − λ2A∗ − (1 − λ2 )B ∗
= (λ1 − λ2) (A∗ − B ∗ ) .

• So, tenure eﬀect is

E (∆) = E [(λ1 − λ2 ) (A∗ − B ∗ )] .
• Experience eﬀect is what stayers and leavers have in common, which is the wage of stayers
minus the tenure eﬀect

Exp Eﬀect = E [λ1A∗ + (1 − λ1 )B ∗ − (λ1 − λ2 ) (A∗ − B ∗ )]
= E [λ2A∗ + (1 − λ2 )B ∗ ] .

• Some intuitive comparative statics:
1. Is tenure eﬀect always positive? No, but usually. Why? Because investment is

directed towards period 1 ﬁrm.

2. If probability of staying ρ larger, investment more idiosyncractic, losses greater in

expectation

15

3. Market thickness has 2 eﬀects:

— Less expected loss conditional on given skills

— Little trade-oﬀ between investing in own ﬁrm and market

— These are complementary — interesting

• Who pays for training? Lazaer asserts that under skill weights approach, ﬁrms in a thin
market have incentive to pay for skills training — because worker will almost surely lose

by leaving.

• Is this correct? I’d say yes. So long as E (∆) = E [(λ1 − λ2 ) (A∗ − B ∗ )] > 0, ﬁrm has
incentive to increase A, B .

• A number of other implications are stated very loosely. Do these follow?
1. “Market Thickness: The implications of market thickness distinguish between the

two theories. In the skill-weights approach, tenure eﬀects should be smaller in thick

markets than in thin markets. No such implication comes from the traditional view.”

2. “Firm Size: When a worker leaves a large ﬁrm, tenure eﬀects should be large. When

a worker joins a large ﬁrm, tenure eﬀects should be smaller. If large ﬁrms have lower

turnover rates and can better cater to a worker’s endowed skills, then workers from

large ﬁrms are likely to be less diversiﬁed in their choice of skills than those from

small ﬁrms. Thus, departures from large ﬁrms should result in larger wage losses.

Conversely, when a worker joins a large ﬁrm, there is a better chance that the worker

will ﬁnd a job that suits his pattern of prior investment because within the ﬁrm there

is a larger range of specialization. This is not an implication of the traditional view

of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital.”

3. “Idiosyncratic Firms: The more idiosyncratic is a ﬁrm’s skill-weights, the larger is

the loss associated with a move. New and unusual technologies, even though general

in the traditional sense, probably have more idiosyncratic weights. As a result,

tenure eﬀects should be

16

4. larger in new and unusual industries. Newness is straightforward to measure, but it

may be more diﬃcult to obtain empirical analogues of “unusualness” in the sense

that few ﬁrms attach signiﬁcant weight to the skill required at the initial ﬁrm.”
