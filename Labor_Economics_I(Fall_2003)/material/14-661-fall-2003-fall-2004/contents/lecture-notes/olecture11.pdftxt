Lecture 11 
Education  
 
Today we start a three series lecture on education.  The general outline is as follows: 
 
The Human Capital Model 
Heterogeneity in returns to schooling 
 
Instrumental Variables Approaches 
Liquidity Constraints 
Sub-optimal Individual choice 
Evidence of Signalling (Acemoglu) 
 
It’s  hard  to  know  where  to  start  with  covering  education.    There  has  been  so much  written  about  it, 
and  not  just  in  economics.    It’s  a  hot  topic  because  it’s  an  easily  identifiable public policy  issue, with 
tons  of  data  available  for  looking  at  it.    The  correlation  between  wages  and  schooling  is  one  of  the 
most  striking  relationships  in  labor  economics.    We  spend  10  –  25  years  in  school.    It’s  well  worth 
understanding  individual’s  reasons  for schooling,  its  impact on  individuals,  the wage distribution, and 
externalities. 
 
The standard human capital earnings function, or Mincerian model takes on the following form:

schooling.    The  U.S.  census  and  BLS  stopped  asking  number  of  years  of  school  and  switched  to 
highest  degree  completed  in  1990.    Often  this  new  definition  is  converted  to  years  of  schooling  by 
guessing  time  to  completion  for  each  degree.   
iX   is  experience,  often  measured  as  the  number  of 
predicted  years  in  the  labor  force based on  school attainment.   This  is  ‘potential experience’, usually 
age – years of school – 6.  This may not be an accurate measure as, more recently, individuals move

in  and  out  of  the  labor  market.    The  model  assumes  the  same  experience  profile  for  all  education 
levels.  Recent research uses a quartic term for experience: 
iX  and 
iX

The Mincer equation assumes schooling only affects  the experience profile  in  levels, and that the  log 
earnings increases with schooling at a linear rate.  This does not have to be the case, but empirically, 
these two functional form specifications seems to hold up reasonably well (e.g. see Card’s Handbook 
Chapter). 
 
Several issues arise in relation to this equation and the interpretation of b.   
 
What is b? 
1) an increase in productivity? 
2) a signal of productivity?: employers use schooling to derive productivity expectations 
3) omitted variables bias, measurement error? 
 
Does b differ by: 
4) SES background? 
5) school quality? 
6) level? (is the process really linear?) 
 
7) How do people choose S? 
8) Are there constraints in choosing S? 
9) Are there externalities from choosing S? 
 
The U.S. government spends about 4.5 percent of GDP on elementary and secondary education and 
1  percent  of  GDP  on  post-secondary  education.    The  U.S.  spends  about  6.5  percent  of  GDP  on 
education  annually.    That’s  a  lot  of money.    An  important  role  in  research  of  education  is  to  answer 
the questions above  to help determine how public  funds might affect short and  long run outcomes of 
interest.

Grilliches, 1977 Econometrica 
Card’s  Model:  (Econometrica,  Handbook  Chapter,  and  ‘Earnings,  Schooling,  and  Ability 
Revisited, ‘Research in Labor Economics, Vol. 14, pp 23-48, 1995) 
  
Grilliches’s  classic  paper  covers  many  of  the  central  issues  underlying  the  human  capital  earnings 
model:  ability  bias  (both  positive  and  negative),  measurement  error,  and  interpretation  of  the 
Mincerian  returns  to  schooling.   Card builds on  this, and  focuses on what measures of  the effects of 
schooling  are  we  interested  in,  what  does  OLS  measures,  IV,  measure,  and  other  empirical 
approaches.

The model’s been written up with earnings not a function of age.  W ith schooling additively separable 
in  age  we  can  ignore  earnings  growth  that  does  not  depend  on  schooling.    This  is  just  a  simplifying 
assumption. 
 
As  I’ve written  it, s does not appear in the utility function.  Therefore, the education decision  is simply 
to  choose  how  much  to  maximize  the  budget  set:  choose  education  to  maximize  income.    The  first 
order conditions are:

Which states  that  individuals  invest  in schooling until  the marginal  return  is equal  to  the  interest rate.  
This  expression  is  where  the  term  ‘returns  to  schooling’  comes  from.    The  left  hand  side  of  this 
expression  is  the marginal benefits  from an  investment  in schooling  (per dollar of  foregone earnings) 
and  the  right  hand  side  as  the  marginal  cost  (the  opportunity  cost  of  the  dollar  investment,  in  this 
case)

marginal benefits or marginal costs of school to avoid corner solutions.

Heterogeneity  in  the  levels  of  initial  earnings  will  tend  to  lower  optimal  schooling.    Think  Bill  Gates, 
Mick  Jagger,  pro-athletes.    This  functional  form  is  admittedly  messy,  but  it  does  get  across  one  of 
Grilliches’  main  points,  which  is  that  there  are  two  forms  of  ability  bias  –  differences  in  ability 
endowments (in  the  levels) which  tends  to  lower optimal education attainment, and differences  in the 
interaction between ability and schooling (in the slopes) which tends to raise optimal education. 
 
There is no apriori reason for believing one dominates over the other, but most researchers are more 
ib .  As Card does, I will ignore the importance of ability 
concerned with ability bias from differences in 

differences in the levels. 

                                                 
1 The relationship between log earnings and schooling does not appear, at first blush, to be linear, as in the 
Mincer equation.  Sub in for S*, however, and notice that the ability bias in b leads to convexity in logy and 
S, while the quadratic expression leads to a concave relationship.  The two may offset each other to 
generate a linear cross-section relationship with a heterogeneous population.  See Card (95) for another 
paragraph and figure about this.

We  can  also  introduce  heterogeneity  in  costs.    Let’s  modify  the  lifetime  utility  function  to  include

I’ve  also  introduced  heterogeneity  in  the  interest  rate.    A  high 

iR   is  often  used  to  proxy  for  liquidity 
constraints.  Individuals that need to borrow to attend school but cannot easily do so can be modelled 
as individuals facing high values of 
iR .

Loosely  speaking,  variation  in 

ib   corresponds  to  variation  in  ‘ability’,  whereas  variation  in 
ir  
corresponds  to  variation  in  ‘access  to  funds’  or  ‘tastes  for  schooling’.    Note  again  that  we  are  not 
looking  at  innate  ability  differences,  independent  of  schooling  (e.g.  athletic  ability),  rather  we  are 
focussing on ability differences in the slope of the returns to schooling. 
 
What are  the main  reasons  for schooling differences? Note special case: when

evaluate  a  particular  schooling  intervention  that  affects  a  specific  sub-population.    We  might  be

Suppose  the  drop  in  college  expenses  leads  to  a  fall  in  r  and  an  increase  in  S,  but  mostly  among 
persons with high B.    If B  is higher  for people who  tend  to have high  values of  r,  such an  instrument 
will identify higher than average B (LATE).  Lang (93), and Card refer to this as discount rate bias.

Card  suggests  this  as  a  reason  why  IV  estimates  from  supply-side  variation  tend  to  be  higher  than 
OLS estimates.   (Measurement error might also be a possibility, but generally IV>OLS more than me 
would suggest). 
 
Example:  Card:  Using  Geographic  Variation  in  College  Proximity  to  Estimate  the  Return  to 
Schooling 
 

Card  takes  data  from  the  U.S.  National  Longitudinal  Survey  of  Young  Men  (NLSYM),  which  began 
with  5525  men  aged  14-24  in  1966  and  occasionally  interviewed  them  later  .    83%  of  these 
individuals  were  interviewed  in  1976.    The  NLSYM  contains  some  geographic  information,  including 
an indicator variable for whether an accredited 4-year college (university) is located close by.  70% of 
individuals did live close by to such a college. 
 
Card’s first stage equation is:

where 

iX   is a dummy  variable  for  the presence of a nearby  college.   For  this  instrument  to be valid, 
this  variable must be  correlated with education attainment, but uncorrelated with v, other  factors  that 
could affect both schooling and Y.   Card’s  idea  for  this  instrument  is  that students who grow up  in an 
area  without  a  college  face  a  higher  cost  of  college  education,  since  the  option  of  living  at  home  is 
precluded.    Once  would  expect  this  higher  cost  to  reduce  investments  in  higher  education,  at  least 
among children from relatively low-income families.

I want  to emphasize here  that we are estimating  the average effect of schooling on earnings only off 
of  the variation  in schooling  from  living close  to or  far away  from a 4-year college.   Therefore, we are 
only estimating  the average effect off of  those affected by  the  instrument, and not  the average effect 
for the entire sample.  Who are the people affected by this instrument?  Likely those from low-income 
parents who  can’t  afford,  or  don’t want  to,  send  their  children  to a  school out of  town.   Thus,  for  this 
group,  the  marginal  cost  to  attend  school  may  be  higher  than  the  average  marginal  cost  if  liquidity 
constraints  play  a  role.    The  marginal  benefits  from  education  may  also  differ  compared  to  the 
average  in  the  sample,  or  for  individuals  under  other  circumstances.    Instrumental  variable 
approaches  estimate  causal  effects  only  off  of  a  particular  group  affected  by  the  instrument.    We 
therefore  can  only  draw  conclusions  from  our  results  for  this  group,  and  not  for  the  rest  of  the 
sample. 
 
What does Card find? Tables 3 and 4. 
 
The  potential  problem with  an  instrumental  variables  strategy  you  should  always  first  consider  is  the 
validity  of  the  instrument.    Is  it  really  true  that  college  proximity  is  unrelated  to  unobservable  factors 
that correlate with Y?  College proximity is obviously related to geography – in particular urban versus 
rural  location.    If  innate  ability  or  demographic  characteristics  that  impact  education  attainment 
choices  (but  not  through  residence  costs)  are  related  to  being  in  an  urban  or  rural  area,  than  this 
instrument  is  invalid  –  we  still  face  omitted  variable  problems,  and  cannot  draw  definite  conclusions 
from the results. 
 
Card  realizes  this,  and  argues  that  if  this  instrument  explains  schooling  differences  only  through  the 
effect of  lowering costs  to some  in attending school,  then we should expect to see a first stage effect 
among individuals with low-income family background versus high-income family background. 
 
See  Figure  1:  This  is  what  he  shows:  The  presence  of  a  nearby  college  has  its  strongest  effect  on 
men  with  lowest  propensities  to  continue  their  education  (men  from  single  headed  families  with  low 
parental education in rural southern areas). 
 

Philip Oreopoulos Labor Economics Notes for 14.661 Fall 2004-05 Lecture 11

Is  this  convincing proof  that  the  instrument  is  valid?    If average  family background characteristics  for 
those  living  in  rural  or  urban  areas  are  the  same  regardless  of  income-class,  then  we  would  expect 
the  same  omitted  variables  bias  when  examining  the  effect  of  schooling  from  individuals  of  low  or 
high  income  groups  with  this  instrument.    The  finding  that we  do  not  suggests  the  omitted  variables 
bias could be small, and we are, indeed, estimating the effect of schooling off of living away from a 4-
year  college.    However,  if  differences  in  urban/rural  background  characteristics  vary  themselves  by 
income group,  then we may still  face omitted variable bias  in  these estimates.    If  low  income  families 
living in urban areas are more likely to place a strong emphasis on education than those living in rural 
areas, but  this  is not  true  for high  income  families  in urban and  rural areas, Card’s  robustness check 
does  not  work.    He  tries  to  add  additional  controls,  such  as  AFQT  ability  measures,  and  broader 
region controls.  You decide. 
 
Card finds that the IV estimates for the return to schooling are larger than the OLS results.   
 
Possibilities: 
 
1) heterogeneous  returns  to education, and marginal  returns higher  to  those  that obtain more school 
from being close to college 
2) Measurement Error in OLS 
3) OLS ability bias downwards (Grilliches argument) 
 
More ‘sinister’ reasons:
