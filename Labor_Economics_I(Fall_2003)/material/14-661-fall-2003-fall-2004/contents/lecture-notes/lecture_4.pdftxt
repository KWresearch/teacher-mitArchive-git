1 Introduction

There have been a number of notable eﬀorts to test eﬃciency wage models in the Shapiro-Stiglitz

vein. These include:

1. Krueger (1991, QJE) “Ownership, Agency and Wages: A Study of the Fast-Food Indus-

try.”

2. Cappelli and Chauvin (1991, QJE): “An Interplant Test of the Eﬃciency Wage Hypoth-

esis.”

3. Holzer, Katz and Krueger (1991, QJE): “Job Queues and Wages.”

I will discuss each of these papers brieﬂy. Why did these all appear in the QJE? Chicago

economists don’t believe in eﬃciency wages.

But in this literature, there is a persistent sense that the neoclassical story is somehow

missing the mark, even if it seems to ﬁt the facts. There is an intuition that norms and fairness

are an important part of the eﬀort equation. Akerlof ’s 1982 (QJE) paper on Gift Exchange is

the ﬁrst to articulate this formally. The 1986 AER article by Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler

presents startling evidence that perceptions of fairness have little to do with opportunity cost

— which is exactly the point where the neoclassical and the gift exchange views part ways.

Economists have been so troubled by the suspicion that the neoclassical models are wrong,

they’ve actually taken to asking business managers what they think. Three papers/books that

do this are:

1. Blinder (AER, 1991), Blinder and Choi (QJE, 1990).

2. Campbell and Kamlani, QJE 1997.

3. Bewley, 2000, Harvard University Press (an entire book of survey evidence from a theo-

rist!)

All of these authors appear less convinced of the neoclassical view after talking to non-

economists about it.

2

Most recently, a combination of theory and laboratory work has begun to structure an

alternative view of fairness and cooperation.

2 Neoclassical evidence

2.1 Krueger, 1991: “Ownership, Agency and Wages: A Study of the Fast-Food
Industry.”

• Q: How do you go about testing eﬃciency wage theory? Many empirical angles are
possible:

— Shirking and wages

— Monitoring and wages

— Existence of involuntary unemployment

— Worker ﬂows and shirking behavior

— Survey evidence on employer motivations

• Krueger 1991 explores the notion that monitoring and wages are substitutes.
• Franchising in the fast food industry:
— Identical products

— Diﬀerent ownership structures

— Franchising: Closer monitoring, few agency problems

— Company stores: Greater agency problems

• See evidence in Table I that supervision less adequate in company jobs.
• Q: What would eﬃciency wage model predict for wages across these two settings?
• Aside: Greenberger and Steinberg (1986) cited by Krueger found that 62% of ﬁrst time
workers in Orange county did at least one of the following in ﬁrst 9 months of employment:

— Gave away goods

3

— Falsely claimed to be sick

— Stole

— Damaged property

— Worked while intoxicated

• Shirking could be even more important in managerial jobs where there is more opportunity
to exercise discretion.

• Perhaps for line jobs, shirking is easier to detect and less costly in terms of foregone
output.

• Note: Bonding model would predict back-loaded compensation (i.e., Lazear contracts).
Hence, the Present Value of contracts would be the same at both types of jobs. See

Krueger Figure I.

2.1.1 Findings

• The Present Value of wage diﬀerences at company-owned versus franchise stores is $1,250
for assistant managers, $75 for full-time workers.

• Company owned restaurants more likely to start part-time workers above the minimum
wage.

• Company owned restaurants also more likely to give free meals, paid vacation, paid sick
leave, paid holidays, and health insurance.

• An alternative interpretation: Agency problems — “expense preference.” Maybe managers
make their own lives easier by paying higher wages at the expense of the company. This

has the same empirical implications as eﬃciency wages except for what? It’s not eﬃcient.

2.2 Cappelli & Chauvin: An Interplant Test of the Efficiency Wage Hypothesis

• Krueger tested implication that ∂ ˆw
∂ q < 0, i.e., better monitoring technology ⇒lower wages
set by ﬁrm.

4

• Another implication we’d like to test: ∂ e
∂ ˆw > 0 ? Do workers shirk less if they are paid
more?

• This question has identiﬁcation problem: Higher wages could be the cause or the result
of higher productivity.

• The test here: Internal wages at a large manufacturing company, 1982:
— All workers in United Auto Workers, which standardizes work and wages across

plants. Same labor agreement for all.

— All production workers in identically speciﬁed jobs within categories.

— Personnel policies on shirking and discipline virtually identical across plants and

centrally adjudicated by unions.

— Wages set by company-wide collective bargaining. Hence, cannot be aﬀected by

plant level productivity.

— Wages can however cause diﬀerences in productivity across plants.

— Premiums 0-100 percent above local wages. Note: may not be eﬃcient “eﬃciency

wages” but should still impact shirking.

— Shirking measure: Rate of dismissal across plants for disciplinary reasons.

• These results sign that the wage-eﬀort elasticity is positive. They do not tell us:
— Magnitude of wage-eﬀort elasticity

— Whether ﬁrms actually take this into account when setting wages. Variation we see

here is due to ﬁrm not having control of its wage policies

— What share of variation in observed wages this explains — if any.

• Yet, this is about as good as it gets
• [Also see Ichino and Riphahn working paper on “Employment Protection and Worker Ef-
fort.” This paper is an odd type of ‘experiment’ because workers are eﬀectively ‘investing’

5

in good behavior in the hopes of securing a ﬂow of quasi-rents in the near future. So, this

does not tell use what shirking would be in the absence of employment protection. But

it again suggests that eﬀort is a choice variable aﬀected by rents at jobs.]

2.3 Efficiency Wages: Holzer, Katz and Krueger

2.3.1 Motivation

• Evidence in Krueger and Summers (1988) — not discussed in class — suggests the existence
of ex post rents in certain jobs: lower turnover, longer tenure in high wage ‘premium’ jobs.

• Evidence on ex ante rents would potentially be more convincing. Do we see applicants
behaving as if some jobs oﬀer rents?

• Idea: Use binding minimum wages as source of rents. Do applicants queue for these jobs?
• Problem: This approach may be less than compelling. Employers may oﬀset some or all
of the minimum wage impact with cuts in beneﬁts and/or non-pecuniary aspects of work

(e.g., safety, working conditions).

• But if wages and beneﬁts are imperfect substitutes, many eﬃciency wage models suggest
that employers will not fully oﬀset mandated wage increases with cuts in other forms of

compensation. In this case, employment rents will increase where minimum wages bind.

2.3.2 Setup

• Consider the following basic competitive wage model:
• The worker’s value of compensation is:

u(w, b) = w + v(b),

(1)

where:

— w is the wage paid.

— b is the ﬁrm’s expenditures on non-wage compensation.

6

— v() is increasing, concave with v 0 (0) > 1 (i.e., the ﬁrst dollar of beneﬁts more valuable
than wages).

• In the absence of minimum wages, ﬁrms choose: w∗ , b∗ such that v 0 (b∗ ) = 1 and w∗ + b∗
is the market clearing compensation level (i.e., worker’s marginal productivity).

2.3.3 Introduction of a binding minimum wage in a basic competitive model

• Assume the government imposes a binding minimum wage such that wm > w∗ .
• If ﬁrms increased wages without reducing beneﬁts we would have w = wm + v(b∗), which
would attract too many applicants. Queues form.

• So ﬁrms will choose beneﬁts b∗∗ < b∗ until the market clears.
• This implies that v(b∗∗ ) > 1.
• Note the ineﬃciency. Employees would gladly trade a $ in wages for a $ dollar in beneﬁts,
but they are unable to do so. ⇒ Minimum wage unambiguously reduces welfare.
2.3.4 Introduction of a binding minimum wage in a model with costly turnover

Competitive case

• The ﬁrm has a quit rate of Q(w + v(b)) where Q0 < 0, Q00 > 0. Turnover is declining in
wages at a decreasing rate.

• Firms’ net cost of turnover is T .
• Firms will therefore choose w to minimize the cost per eﬃciency unit of labor:
c = w + b + T Q(w + v(b)).
min
w,b

(2)

and the FOCs are:

∂ c
∂w
∂ c
∂ b

= 1 + T Q0(w∗ + ν (b∗ )) = 0,

= 1 + T Q0(w∗ + ν (b∗ )) · v 0 (b∗ ).

7

• Simplifying:

T Q0 (w∗ + ν (b∗)) = −1
−1
v 0 (b∗) =
= 1
T Q0(w∗ + ν (b∗ ))

(3)

(4)

• Substituting (3) into (4) gives

v 0 (b∗) = 1.

At the unconstrained optimum, a $1 increase in either wages or beneﬁts reduces turnover

costs by $1.

Adding binding minimum wage

• Now consider imposition of wm > w∗ .
• The ﬁrm will still want to choose b to satisfy 4, i.e.,
v 0(b∗∗ )T Q0 (wm + ν (b∗∗ )) = −1.

(5)

• In other words, it is still equating the marginal costs of non-wage beneﬁts with the
marginal gains in eﬃciency units of labor.

• Notice if the ﬁrm fully oﬀsets the minimum wage such that bm = b∗ − (wm − w∗ ), then
this gives

and

T Q0 (wm + bm) = −1,

v 0 (bm ) > 1,

(6)

which means that 5 would not be satisﬁed.

• If the ﬁrm had chosen bm , it would ﬁnd that the next $1 in beneﬁts would more than pay
for itself with a reduction in turnover.

• Hence, to satisfy 5, it must be the case that b∗ > b∗∗ > bm , which implies that:
ABS |T Q0(w∗ + ν (b∗∗ ))| < 1,
v 0 (b∗∗ ) > 1.

8

• In other words, the ﬁrm does not ful ly oﬀset minimum wage increases with one-for-one
beneﬁt reductions. If it did, the next dollar in beneﬁts would have reduced turnover costs

by more than a dollar.

• These implies that worker utility in minimum wage jobs has unambiguously increased.
Wages rise, beneﬁts fall, but the total attractiveness of the job is higher:

wm + v(b∗∗ ) > w∗ + v(b∗ ).

• What is happening here is the following:
— Wages are forced to rise by some amount by the binding minimum.

— Fully oﬀsetting the ensuing rents would be ineﬃcient because this would induce too

much costly turnover.

— The reason is that the beneﬁts and wages are imperfect substitutes. The ﬁrst dollar

of beneﬁts costs the ﬁrm less than workers value it. If the beneﬁts function were not

concave with v 0 (0) > 1, this result would not hold.

2.3.5 Implications

• Workers earn rents at binding minimum wage jobs ⇒ Queues of applicants.
• Other possible reasons why minimum wages induce rents in the labor market:
— Fairness/equity. Employers are constrained by fairness from ‘taking back’ the entire

wage increase with beneﬁt reductions.

— Non-negativity constraints on beneﬁts.

— Non-excludability. Cannot reduce beneﬁts to minimum wage workers without harm-

ing other workers too, e.g., shutting oﬀ the heat.

• Assume that job oﬀer odds are equal to one over the application rate p.
• Applicants will want to equate expected utility across jobs i, j , so pi [wi + v(bi)] = pj [wj +
v(bj )]

9

• So, jobs paying rents will attract longer queues.
• Note that if a job is paying compensating diﬀerentials, this would not necessarily be true.
• Caveat: If high wage jobs also attract many unqualiﬁed applicants, this would also give
rise to queues in the absence of eﬃciency wage considerations.

• But it’s not clear why this queuing would cluster at minimum wage jobs.
• Another caveat: Let’s say ﬁrms did fully oﬀset minimum wage hikes with beneﬁts cuts.
Workers might not realize this, and so still queue for minimum wage jobs in incorrect

expectation that they’ll receive rents.

2.3.6 Results on minimum wages

• Table I
— More applicants at minimum wage jobs than jobs slightly above or below.

— Characteristics of applicants at minimum and subminimum jobs are similar.

— Firms paying subminimum are smaller.

• Table II
— Regression estimates of minimum wage diﬀerential are large and signiﬁcant (about

25%).

— Robust to inclusion of geographic, ﬁrm size and industry dummies.

— Would have been great to do this across jobs within companies.

2.3.7 Are industry and/or union premia also rents?

• Let A equal ln applicants per job. We’d like to estimate
A = W αw + X αx + (cid:18)A ,

where

W = AβA + Z β Z + X βX + (cid:18)W ,

10

and

plim Z 0(cid:18)A = 0.

In this system of equations, αw is the elasticity of applications with respect to the wage,
and Z is a vector of (valid) instruments.

• Since W and A are simultaneously determined in this system, we want to instrument W
with Z.

• Table III
— Surprisingly weak evidence that industry wage premia are rents.

— Minimum wage dummy remains robust.

• Figure I:
— Relationship between wage premia and apps appears quite visible.

— Notice the Mining industry. What’s going on here? Possibly a compensating diﬀer-

ential.

• Table IV
— Use union and ﬁrm size dummies along with industry dummies as wage instruments.

— Firm size fails the over-ID test, suggesting that it’s not a good instrument.

— Using industry and union as instruments while including ﬁrm size in the applications

equation gives weak results.

• “A larger proportion of the interindustry wage structure than previously believed may be
attributable to compensating wage diﬀerentials for non-wage conditions of work.”

11

2.3.8 Conclusions

• Some evidence of rents in labor market.
• Interindustry wage structure looks more or less robust depending on the approach used
(Krueger/Summers vs. HKK).

• Is HKK a high power test of rents? No. But works surprisingly well.
3 Theory and evidence on norms, reciprocity and effort

3.1 Fehr and Gachter, 2002, “Do Incentive Contracts Undermine Voluntary
Cooperation

Once you begin to suspect that “fairness” regulates labor market contracts, you are theoretically

at sea. Economists know a great deal about opportunity costs as a normative concept and little

about other possible regulators of behavior. Therefore, norms are going to be hard to “test”

in observational setting — it’s not exactly clear what to look for. This is why a laboratory

experiments so useful: can specify what types of incentives are to be used (standard economic

incentives, and non-incentive-comptabile alternatives) and see how these contracts perform in:

1. Eliciting eﬀort

2. Generating proﬁts.

Fehr and Gachter’s smart and subtle paper (2002, AER forthcoming) performs some tests.

3.1.1 The setup.

Two types of contracts: Incentive and Trust. In both contracts:

1. The buyer’s oﬀer labor contracts — Specifying a price and a quality

2. Sellers accept or refuse contracts. No other negotiations are possible.

3. These are one shot deals transacted anonymously. There is no possibility of developing

an individual reputation.

12

4. After agreement, the seller ‘produces’ by generating output at some quality level.

In

practice, this just means selecting a quality level to deliver.

5. The buyer’s gain: rising in quality and declining in price

6. The seller’s gain: only a function of price, not of quality

7. There is always an excess supply of sellers (more sellers than buyers); sellers do not have

power to hold up buyers for a contract

8. In the Trust Treatment, there is no opportunity for punishment if the seller ‘shirks’ by

producing less than the agreed quality.

9. In the Incentive Treatment, buyer can penalize seller if seller is detected shirking. Shirking

is detected 1/3rd of time.

3.1.2 Trust Treatment (TT)

Buyer oﬀers a contract {p, ˆq} where p is the price and ˆq is the desired quality level. In this
treatment, ˆq is never enforceable. Buyer’s proﬁt is
π = n vq − p
o ,
0
with v = 100, 0 ≤ p ≤ 100,and q {.1, .2, ..., 1}. q is delivered quality.
Seller’s payoﬀ is
¾ .
u = ½ p − c(q)
0
where the cost of quality is

If contract accepted
If no contract

If contract accepted
If no contract

In this treatment, there is no subgame perfect incentive to provide any level of quality

exceeding q = 0.1. Given this, there is no reason to oﬀer a price exceeding p = 1 (or potentially
p = 0). So, the incentive compatible equilibrium of this game is {1, .1}.
This is not socially eﬃcient. Given that the marginal cost of q to the seller less is always

less than its marginal value to the buyer, eﬃciency requires that q = 1.

13

3.1.3 Incentive Treatment (IT)

The basic diﬀerence between TT and IT is that in IT, the seller can be punished if caught

shirking. Shirking is detected with probability s = 1/3, and the shirker is ﬁned the amount
f ∈ [0, 13], speciﬁed in the contract, which is now stipulated as {p, ˆq , f }. Hence, the payoﬀs
become:
) ,
π = ( vq − p
if contract accepted and q ≥ ˆq
if contract accepted and q < ˆq
vq − p + sf
if no contract
0
and similarly for the buyer
) .
u = ( p − c(q)
p − c(q) − sf
0
A selﬁsh seller will accept the contract if the participation constraint is met

if contract accepted and q ≥ ˆq
if contract accepted and q < ˆq
if no contract

p ≥ c(q∗ ),
where q∗ is the quality level that maximizes the seller’s payoﬀ. The seller will provide quality
ˆq if the No Shirking Constraint (NSC) is satisﬁed:

c( ˆq) ≤ sf
Assuming linearity of buyer utility, the highest quality level that can be enforced (using f = 13)

is c ( ˆq∗ ) = 4.33, which corresponds to ˆq∗ = .4. The price associated would be 5 (or 4 depending
on the assumption about what an indiﬀerent seller does). So, the highest power incentive
compatible contract is simply {p = 5, ˆq = .4, f = 13} .
Notice that this contract is ineﬃcient for the same reasons as above. But it would be

predicted to outperform TT given that it is enforceable.

3.1.4 The Bonus Treatment (BT)

A concern is that ﬁnes f designed to elicit high quality levels may be perceived as hostile per

se. More generally, explicit incentives may be viewed as a sign of distrust — and if that is viewed

as unkind, it may generate an adverse response. So, re-frame the issue: Bonus Treatment (BT)

instead of IT:

14

• In the IT, a seller pays a ﬁne f if caught shirking.
• In the BT, a buyer pays the seller a bonus if he is detected not shirking. That is, in
2/3rd of cases where q ≥ ˆq , the seller pays b ∈ [0, 13], which is stipulated in the contract
{p0 , ˆq , b}.
• Hence, these contracts are isomorphic with p = p0 + b.
Note that they F/G do not use value laden language in the experiment framing. In the IT,

the ﬁne is called “A potential price deduction.” In the BT, it’s called a “potential supplementary

price.”

3.1.5 A tiny behavioral model

F&G discuss ‘reciprocal’ and ‘inequity averse’ sellers. These concepts probably have similar

predictions but diﬀerent behavioral mechanisms. Reciprocal sellers play tit-for-tat strategies.

Hence, two reciprocal players who meet will outperform two purely selﬁsh players. But the

behavior is still arguably selﬁsh. Inequity averse sellers get direct disutility from outcomes that

do not beneﬁt both sides equally.

A simple inequity averse utility function might look like:

Ui (x) = xi − αi max {xj − xi , 0} − β i max {xi − xj , 0} ,
with αi ≥ β i and 0 ≤ β i ≤ 1. In this formulation, i places negative weight on any deviation
from an ‘equitable’ outcome for either party. But αi ≥ β i means that i weakly prefers inequity
favoring herself. Assuming α = β = 0.5, seller utility is maximized when

π = 100q − p = p − c(q) = u,
(assuming p is high enough to support an equilibrium with both players beneﬁting).

Notice that

∂ q/∂p = 2/ (100 + c0 (q)) > 0.

Higher oﬀered prices yield higher quality from inequity averse players. Hence, if you were a

selﬁsh buyer facing inequity averse players, you might rationally oﬀer a price above pmin = 5.

Denote the ‘payoﬀ equalizing’ quality level as qe .

15

This model is developed further in the paper, but it turns out not to be too relevant.

Why? Even where sellers are oﬀered non-incentive compatible contracts in the IT, they still

perform like selﬁsh players in general. Moreover, when the IT payoﬀs are re-framed as a “bonus

treatment” instead of a “punishment treatment” later in the study, sellers behave much less

selﬁshly in the IT with punishment treatment. This suggests that something about framing —

threats are perceived as slights even if not carried out — rather than inequity aversion is a better

explantation for oﬀ-equilibrium-path behavior in both treatments. In other words, sellers don’t

act as if they are inequity averse when faced with incentive contracts.

3.1.6 Results

The results here are quite rich. It’s a credit to the authors that they are as good as extracting

deductions from experiments as at designing them.

1. In the TT, buyers oﬀer on average higher prices and demand higher quality than in the

IT.

2. The average ﬁne in the IT is close to the maximum of 13 (and the median is 13).

See Table 2

See Figure 2

3. Quality and voluntary cooperation are lower in the IT than the TT. This is because

• A fraction of sellers shirks in the IT even when the NSC is met! (risk loving?)
• Voluntary cooperation (q − q∗ > 0) vanishes almost completely in the IT. Almost no
one performs beyond the minimum.

— In 62 percent of NIC (non-incentive compatible) IT contracts, sellers
deliver the minimum quality.

— In 69 percent of TT contracts, they deliver above minimum.

• If the NSC is violated, sellers generally select the minimum quality
• In the TT, voluntary cooperation responds strongly to the price level. In the IT,
there is no gradient.

16

See Table 3.

See Figure 3.

4. Total surplus is on average higher in TT than IT, whether comparing to IC or NIC

incentive contracts.

5. But the proﬁt for buyers is highest for incentive compatible IT contracts, second highest

for TT-contracts, and lowest for NIC incentive contracts.

See Table 6.

6. It appears that the reduction of voluntary cooperation in the IT was not caused by

low price oﬀers. Rather, low price oﬀers were a response to a lack of sellers’ voluntary

cooperation in the IT. Even in the 1st period — where sellers did make oﬀers well above

pmin , the vast ma jority of buyers still provided only q∗ .
See Figure 4.

See Figure 5A, 5B

7. When the problem was re-framed using the Bonus Treatment (BT), cooperation was

much higher than in the IT (though still lower than the TT), and there was a signiﬁcant

quality-price gradient.

See Figure 6.

3.2 Conclusions

In my assessment, the eﬃciency wage literature speaks positively about the intellectual health

of the Economics profession. Although economists might have concluded ‘problem solved’ af-

ter Shapiro-Stiglitz was published (and some did), apparently many other economists suﬀered

from a troubled conscience. The problem was suﬃciently important — and the proposed solu-

tion suﬃciently unsatisfactory — that they kept pushing. Akerlof was early — of course. But

twenty plus years after publication of Akerlof ’s Gift Exchange article, experimental economists

are providing rigorous evidence potentially supporting what Akerlof intuited as an alternative

explanation for Shapiro-Stiglitz. A healthy tendency in labor economics in particular has been

the close interaction between theory and facts, and this has served both disciplines well.

I

17

suspect that a considerable amount of empirical work in labor economics over the next decade

will explore how norms shape labor market interactions, and this will change our conception of

‘eﬃcient’ labor contracts.
