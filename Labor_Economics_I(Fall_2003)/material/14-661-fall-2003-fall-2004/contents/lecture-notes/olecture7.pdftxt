Minimum Wage (I won’t discuss in class) 
 
Card and Krueger and Neumark, AER 
 
If  the  supply  curve  for  labor  is  not  completely  inelastic  (vertical),  then  labor demand  helps determine 
the  equilibrium  wage  that  workers  obtain.    This  theory  was  developed  as  far  back  as  Hicks’  work  in 
the  1930s,  so  note  there  was  no  data  to  really  examine  the  initial  discussion  of  labor  demand  at  the 
time.    In many  cases, economists  are  interested  in  the  demand  for  labor  for  the  sake  of  knowing  the 
expected response to wages from a change in labor demand from things such as a technology shock, 
unionization, and business cycle fluctuations.   
 
The theory of two-factor labor demand 
 
Suppose  there  are  two  factors  used  to  produce  Y .    The  usual  approach  is  to  consider  these  factors 
be labor,  L , and capital,  K , although the analysis also applies when considering high skill versus low 
skill, old versus young, and immigrant versus non-immigrant workers. 
 
The  production  function  is:

The first order conditions are:

where  λ  is  the  Lagrangean  multiplier.    The  ratio  of  the  two  conditions  shows  the  familiar  statement

A crucial parameter of interest in the labor demand framework is the elasticity of substitution between 
K and L, holding output constant.  This is the rate of change in the use of K to L from a change in the 
relative price of w to r, holding output constant.  The definition of this elasticity is:

Intuitively,  this  elasticity measures  the  ease  of  substituting  one  input  for  the  other  when  the  firm  can 
only respond to a change in one or both of the input prices by changing the relative use of two factors 
without changing output. 
 
If σ approaches infinite, the two factors become perfect substitutes, while as σ approaches zero, the 
two  factors  cannot  be  substitutes.    A  low  σ  is  desirable  from  a  worker’s  perspective,  because  it 
implies a firm cannot replace the worker easily with another factor input.    
 
This elasticity can also be expressed more intuitively as follows:

Equation  (1)  shows  that  σ  is  always  non-negative.    The  value  of 
LKF   depends  on  the  shape  of  the 
production  function,  but  is  always  positive  under  usual  production  function  assumptions.    It  is  by  no 
means  trivial  to derive (1).   You should go  through  it at  least once.   I provide a proof at  the end of my 
notes. 
 
We are also, of  course,  interested  in  the  straightforward  response  to  the  change  in demand  for  labor 
from a change in its wage.  This is the constant output labor demand elasticity:

.   When output  requires  substantial amounts of

Y
labor for production, the constant output labor demand elasticity will be smaller, because the possible 
change  in spending on other factors  is small relative  to the amount of  labor being used.  See proof at 
the back of the notes. 
 
The  constant  output  cross-elasticity  of  demand  for  labor  describes  the  response  to  labor  from  a 
change in the price of the other factor, in this example, capital:

Finally, we need to take into account the possibility that output will change as a response to a change 
in the price of labor, and that in turn may affect the overall demand for labor, we can take into account

the  ‘scale  effect’.   When  the  wage  rate  increases,  the  cost  of  producing  a  given  output  rises.    In  a 
competitive product market, a 1 percent rise in a factor price raises cost, and eventually product price, 
by  that  factor’s  share.    This  reduces  the  quantity  of  output  sold.    The  scale  effect  is  thus  the  factor’s 
share times the product demand elasticity.  Thus, the total response from a change in the wage is:

Equation  (4)  is  the  fundamental  factor  law  of  demand.    It  divides  the  labor  demand  elasticity  into 
substitution  and  scale  effects.    The  environment  for  which  this  elasticity  holds  is  one  with  constant 
returns  to  scale  production,  perfect  competitive,  and  every  firm  faces  the  same  production  function 
and output demand elasticity. 
 
Both  (2)  and  (4)  are  helpful  to  try  estimate  the  elasticity  of  labor  demand,  depending  on  the 
assumptions one wishes to make about the problem under study. 
 
The  alternative  approach  derives  the  elasticity  of  labor  demand  from  the  cost  function:  total  cost 
expressed  as  a  function  of  optimized  demand  for  factors  of  production.    If  a  firm  maximizes  profits, 
this also implies they minimize costs. 
 
A  firm  chooses  L  and  K  to  minimize: 
,( KLFY =
 
)
 
After  solving  for  L  and  K  from  the  first  order  conditions,  we  can  get  express  costs  that  minimize  a 
certain level of production, subject to w, r, and Y:

Estimating Elasticities of Labor Demand 
 
The  game  of  estimating  these  elasticities  is  to  propose  a  production  function  that  ameliorates  the 
estimation  process.    For  example,  forget  using Cobb-Douglas:  the elasticity  of  substitution  is  fixed at 
one.    As  another  example,  another  production  function  is  the  Constant  Elasticity  of  Substitution 
function  (CES),  which,  as  you  might  guess  from  the  name,  the  elasticity  of  labor  demand  does  not 
depend on current production, or costs.  The CES function is:

And we  can  try  to  estimate  this,  adding  an error  term.   And estimate  of  the  constant-output  elasticity 
ˆβ.    Unfortunately,  this  specification  seems  grossly  unrealistic:  the 
of  labor  demand  is  therefore

elasticity does not depend on the current level of production, or the current relative use of each factor. 
 
Note, if the price of capital is constant, we are in effect estimating a regression equation similar to one 
we’ve seen before for labor supply: 
 
log
 
But  the  interpretation  of  the  coefficient  is  entirely  different.    This  gives  us  some  idea  of  the 
complexities  of estimating  these elasticities.   We  need  some way  of determining whether  the  reason 
for  the  wage  fluctuations  are  due  to  exogenous  changes  in  labor  supply,  or  exogenous  changes  in 
labor demand.  We also need to assure no omitted variables bias.  As you can imagine, the credibility 
of these estimates depends crucially on the research design of the analysis.

Perhaps the most popular method of estimating the elasticities of labor demand is to use the translog 
cost  function,  which  is  often  interpreted  as  a  second-order  approximation  to  an  unknown  functional 
YrwCC =

form.    One  way  to  derive  it  is  as  follows:  From  the  unknown  function,

variables  by  dividing  by  their  respective  sample means.   The  interesting  elasticities  in  this model are 
unaffected by the normalization”.

An Application Using the Estimated Elasticity of Demand for High/Low Skilled Workers 
 
The rise  in relative wage  inequality  in  the United States, beginning  in  the  late 1970s, seems  to match 
the  pattern  on  the  rise  in  the  college  premium  (dummy  variable  for  college,  or  rise  in  the  return  to 
education).    This  rapid  increase  in  the  college  premium  is  widely  interpreted  as  evidence  that  labor 
market  forces  were  driving  up  the  price  of  skills.    The  argument  is  reinforced  by  the  fact  that  the 
increase  in  the  college  premium  was  also  accompanied  by  a  rise  in  the  relative  college  labor  force.  
Ceteris paribus, the increase in the supply of college graduates should have led to a reduction in their 
relative wages.  Ergo, a shift in the demand for college graduates seems likely. 
  One obvious explanation  for what caused a shift  in  the  relative demand  for college graduates  is a 
change  in  productivity.    A  Skill  Biased  Technological  Shock  to  a  particular  labor  group’s  level  of 
productivity  can  raise  their  relative  wages,  thus  producing  predicted  changes  to  the  labor  market 
which match what is observed empirically.

  OK,  moving  on.    Empirically,  we  know  that  relative  labor  supply  of  college  graduates  has  risen, 
while  relative  wages  for  college  grads  has  also  increased.    If  we  substitute  skilled  labor  for  college 
labor, and unskilled labor for high school labor, then from (5), we see that for this relationship to hold, 
there  must  have  been  a  productivity  shock  for  college  grads  (σ  is  almost  always  assumed  greater 
than  one,  based  on  econometric  estimation  –  see  Hamermesh’s  book  on  labor  demand,  chapter 
three).    It  is  perhaps  better  to  speak of  college  vs.  high  school  rather  than  skilled  vs.  unskilled.   This 
helps  us  understand  exactly  what  kind  of  technological  shock  we  need  to  explain  the  data  –  a  kind 
which  raises  the  relative  productivity  for  college  graduates  compared  to  those  of  high  school 
graduates. 
 
The  rise  in  the  rate  of  return  to  education  is  compelling  evidence  that  there  was  indeed  such  a 
productivity  shock.    This  is  what  led  many  economists  to  investigate  the  possibility  of  skill  biased

inequality.    One  crucial  problem  to  keep  in  mind  with  this  research  is  that  we  are  dealing  with  two 
vague  concepts:  changes  in  skill and  changes  in  technology, both of which are hard  to measure and 
hard  to clearly define.    In order  to assess  the SBTC hypothesis, we need  to quantify  these concepts,

which  is  easier  said  than  done.    There  are  what  I  would  call  three  approaches  to  empirically 
investigating  whether  SBTC  was  the  main  contributor  for  rising  wage  inequality:  the  residual 
approach, the case study approach, and the ‘it must be the computer’ approach.

annum  (Johnson  JEP  1997).    This  value  is  considered  quite  large.    Note  that most  estimates  for  σ 
1>σ   for SBTC 
run  between  1  and 2.   Some  particular  forms  of  the CES production  function  require 
to exist.  Also, the value of σ is subject to some debate. 
 
This  approach  has  been  applied  using  more  empirically  intensive  methods.    The  most  commonly 
refered  to  papers  in  this  area  are  Berman,  Eli,  Jon  Bound,  and  Zvi  Griliches.  1994  “Changes  in  the 
Demand  for  Skilled  Labor within U.S. Manufacturing  Industries:  Evidence  from  the  Annual  Survey  of 
Manufacturing.” Quarterly Journal of Economics (May): 367-397, Bound and Johnson (AER, 92), and 
Katz  and Murphy  (QJE  92).    In  very  general  terms,  these  papers apply  a  similar  ‘residual’  approach, 
but for finer data, looking at a larger number of worker group classes, and for different industries.  The 
finding  that  no  factor  outside  of SBTC  seems  to  have  changed  enough  to  observe  the magnitude  of 
change in relative wages, however, is consistent among all three.  They then conclude that some sort 
of technological shock must be the culprit. 
 
Application 1: The effect of immigration on native wages and employment 
 
One of the more interesting applications to labor demand theory is to examine the comparative statics 
of  equilibrium wages  and employment  after a  change  in  immigration.   George  Johnson  (ILRR,  1980) 
provides  a  nice model  that  describes  the main  predictions,  which  end  up  depending  crucially  on  the 
elasticities of both supply and demand.

When  labor  demand  for  unskilled workers more  elastic  (can  substitute  other  inputs more  easily with  unskilled 
labor  ), wages will  less.   This  is  just  from  a  shift  in  the overall  labor  supply  curve when  labor demand  curve  is 
flat (draw on board).  Also, if labor supply more elastic (work less if wage increases), the wage will change less.  
This is because the firm has less ability to adjust wages without losing workers that are currently at the firm.

Immigrants affect the labor market of natives only to the extent that they affect wages. 
 
If  labor demand  for unskilled perfectly  elastic, no displacement.   Firms  are use  all new  immigrants plus  all old 
natives. 
 
If labor demand perfectly inelastic, perfect displacement.  E.g. firms must use X unskilled workers.  Immigrants 
mdE1   are  used  to 
have  inelastic  labor  supply  and  are willing  to work  at  any wage.   Wage  adjust  downwards  as 

replace natives. 
 
Perfect  displacement  also  if  labor  supply  of  native  unskilled workers  perfectly  elastic.   Natives  respond  to  any 
change in wage by a big fall in employment (they all stop working in this extreme case).  
 
Assumptions of model: 
 
1)  natives and immigrants perfect substitutes 
2)  natives and immigrants get same wage 
3)  All immigrants work 
4)  No interaction with other inputs (no complemtarity) 
5)  Immigrants don’t buy anything (no demand effects) 
 
Relaxing  this  last  assumption  can  change  the  predictions  dramatically.    If  demand  for  goods  within  a  city 
increases  the  same  rate  as  immigration,  constant  returns  to  scale  implies  no  impact  from  immigration  (Card 
calls  this  ‘the Krueger  conjecture’).   We may be more  interested, however,  in  the  short  run  impact, which may 
still last some time before demand effects mitigate the wage impact (and perhaps only partially).

For  a  model  that  considers  demand  effects,  see  Altonji  and  Card,  “The  effects  of  immigration  on  th  elabor 
market outcomes of natives’. 
 
Empirical Evidence of Effects of Immigration 
 
A. Mariel boatlift 
 
Summer of 1980, Castro let people leave for a few months: let prisoners, hospital patients, any ‘scum’ 
who wants to leave Cuba to go or forever hold their peace. (See Scarface) 
 
More  than  125,000  Cubans  arrived  to  the  port  of  Mariel,  and  most  settled  in  Miami.    Increased  the 
labor  force  (adult  working  pop)  by  7%!,  unskilled  working  pop  increased  more),  Increased  Cuban 
population by 20%. 
 
What’s nice is we have an exogenous shock to labor supply not likely do to response in local demand 
factors.   
 
Compare  with  similar  cities:  Atlanta,  Los  Angelas,  Houston,  and  Tampa-St.  Petersburg,  who  also 
have large Black and Hispanic population. 
 
Provides  a  simple  but  clear  diff  in  diff  study.   What  happened  to  wages  and  employment  in  Miami, 
relative to ‘counterfactual’ control group where supply shock did not occur. 
 
Figure 1 in Angrist and Krueger 
 
General results suggest large increase in labor supply from immigrants had minimal impact on wages 
and labor supply of natives. 
 
Concerns with diff in diff strategy: control groups are not the same as Miami. 
Total population in city may have changed: natives may have moved out.

Most native population don’t compete with natives.  
 
B. Card (JoLE 2001) 
 
Another  approach  to  test  the  effects  of  immigration  is  to  treat  cities  as  separate  economies  and 
examine the correlation between native wages and the fraction of immigrants in a city.

cny   is  the mean outcome  for native group N  in city  c.   Clearly  there  is an omitted variables bias concern 
if  the  fraction of  immigrants  is  somehow  correlated with unobservables  related  to city wages.    Just considering 
demand factors along, we would expect immigrants to move to cities that pay relatively more, which would bias 
the elasticity estimate upwards.  
 
Some have tried differencing over two time periods:

with  the  idea being  that  the  first differences  approach  removes  city  specific  factors  that  are  constant over  time.  
Transitory effects will still lead to bias. 
 
One  approach  has  been  to  instrument 

cf∆   with  the  fraction  of  immigrants  in  the  city  at  the  start  of  the  initial 
period.    The  motivation  is  that  immigrants  are  mainly  attracted  to  cities  with  large  concentrations  of  previous 
immigrants  from  the  same  country.    The  first  difference  approach  is  also  more  likely  to  capture  short  run 
effects. 
 
The coefficient for  δ with  this approach is about -.1.  A 10 percent point increase in the fraction of immigrants 
in  a  city  decreases  wages  by  1  percent.    This  evidence  seems  to  coincide  with  the  mariel  boatlift  paper 
suggesting the labor market impact of immigration is small.

2 major concerns with the cross-city approach: 
 
1)  natives may move out, and this is not reflected in estimates: labor supply may not be changing (denominator 
in f is getting smaller). 

 
2)  upward  bias  may  still  remain  if  instrument  (initial  fraction  of  immigrants  in  city)  correlated  with  demand 
shock trends or other factors.

Notice, we  haven’t  yet  brought  immigrants  into  the  picture.   A  exogenous  change  in  the  city-occupation  labor

perfectly substitutable – we would expect no effect from immigration). 
 
Estimating occupation populations.  For the sample working, estimate probability of being in occupation group j

Empirical  Application  to  Labor  Demand:  The  Effect  of  Raising  the  Minimum  Wage  on 
Employment 
 
Most of us learn in 1st year undergraduate economics the theoretical implications of a minimum wage 
in  a  perfectly  competitive  setting.    Graphically,  it’s  easy  to  describe  the  argument:  if  authorities 
impose  a minimum wage  for workers  above  the market  clearing wage,  competitive  firms will  choose 
to  hire  less  labor.    How  large  the  response  will  depend  on  the  elasticity  of  demand  for  labor:  if  the 
elasticity  is  high,  firms  will  substitute  away  from  low  skilled  /  low  paid  workers  for  other  factors  to 
produce Y. 
 
In  early  1990,  the  State  of  New  Jersey  passed  a  bill  to  raise  the  state minimum  wage  from  $4.25  to 
$5.05.   The  law  change was not  to happen until 1992,  two  year  later.   David Card and Alan Krueger 
decided  to  test  the  theory  of  minimum  wages  and  measure  the  response  in  employment  from  this 
change.    A  few  months  before  the  change,  they  telephoned  managers  and  assistant  managers  at  
hundreds  of  fast-food  chains  in  New  Jersey.    They  asked  about  the  wages  paid  to  employees,  and 
how  many  each  restaurant  employed  (number  of  full-time  and  part-time  workers).    They  picked  the 
fast  food  industry  because  these  stores  obviously  pay  employers  low-wages,  they  comply  with 
minimum wage regulations, and the set of skills, and tasks of non-manger employees are similar. 
 
One possible empirical strategy  is  to simply compare  the average employment  rates before and after 
the change.  Consider the following regression analysis

1=gtT
gtH   is  the  average  labor  supply  for  group  g,  in  period  t, 
for  group  1,  zero  otherwise.    The  analysis  is  over  time.    Let  t=1  the  year=1991  (before  the  change) 
and  t=2  if  the  year  =  1993  (after  the  change).    Note  the  authors  have  not  control  over  how  large  or 
small the change is: they are only able to examine the effect from the change in New Jersey. 
 
Key  here  is, what  is  the  counterfactual??   We’d  like  to  know  the  treatment  effect  relative  to  a  similar 
group that was not eligible. 
 
The  estimate  of  B1  from  the  above  equation  is  equivalent  to  taking  the  difference  between  H  before 
and  after  the  change.    What  is  our  estimate  for  B1?    Well,  the  above  equation  just  has  two 
observations  for  G=1  (the  group  of  all  fast  food  chains).    The  OLS  estimate  for  B1  is  equal  to  the 
difference between H before and after the change: 
 
H
 
By  construction, 

11v   =  0.  
12v   or 
gtv   =  0  over  both  periods  combined,  but  this  does  not  mean  that 
Notice we are comparing means over two different time periods.  Any underlying trends in labor force 
participation  or  hours  of  work  between  1991  and  1993,  or  any  economic  shocks  that  affect  labor 
market  outcomes will  affect H  differently  over  the  time  frame  examined.    In other words, we  attribute 
any difference over this 2 year time period to the change in the minimum wage, but any effect to labor 
supply over the same time period examined cannot be separated by the minimum wage’s effect. 
 
To  get  around  this,  Card  and  Krueger  take  what  is  know  as  a  ‘difference  in  differences’  strategy.  
They  try  to  find  a  ‘control’  group  that was  not  affected  by  the minimum wage  shock being examined, 
but was affected by other shocks or trends that are not controlled for. 
 
Card  and  Krueger  decide  also  to  collect  data  for  fast-food  employment  in  the  neighboring  state, 
Pennsylvania.   Pennsylvania did not experience a change  in  the minimum wage  that New Jersey did

gv   and 
tv   are  ‘fixed  effects’.    This  is  just  a  fancy  word  for  dummy  variables.   We  include  a  dummy 
variable  for  whether  the  individual  is  from  group  1  or  2,  to  control  for  the  time  invariant  mean 
difference  in  H  between  the  two  groups,  and  the  group  invariant  mean  difference  in  H  between  the 
two  periods.    Including  these  dummy  variables  is  equivalent  to  estimating  B1  from  the  difference  in 
differences of H: 
 
(
 
The  estimate  of B1  is  unbiased  if  (

affect  the  two groups over  the  time period  the  same way,  then  taking  the difference between  the  two 
groups will absorb those shocks. 
 
The  difference  in  differences  strategy makes  2  crucial  assumptions:  1)  the  time  effects  are  common 
between  the  groups,  2)  the  composition  of  both  groups  remains  stable  before  and  after  the  policy 
change. 
 
The smaller the time range examined, the less likely other factors will explain the differences. 
 
Note,  essentially  the way  I’ve  described  this  analysis,  there  are  only  4  observations:  the mean  labor 
supply  for  the  2  groups,  before  and after  the  change.    If we  can  observe  other  factors  for  individuals 
that  could  affect  labor  supply  (that  could  change  between  periods),  we  may  be  able  to  get  more 
efficient  estimates  by  controlling  for  these  observables  and  working  at  a  smaller  level  of  data  than 
means.

number of  teenagers affected: between 8% and 30% of  jobs held by  teenagers pay within 5  cents of 
the  adult  minimum  wage.    More  able  to  look  account  for  long-run  adjustments  because  longer 
bandwidth.    Card  and Krueger  only  look  at  the  year  before  and  after.    If  adjustments  take  time,  they 
may  miss  this.    Short  differences  may  prematurely  censor  the  adjustment  in  employment.    BBS 
suggest examining changes over a 4 year period at  least.   BBS find  in Table 1 a significant and clear 
minimum  wage  effect,  lowering  teen  employment  with  province  and  year  fixed  effects.    The 
independent  variable  is  the minimum  wage  divided  by  the  average  provincial  wage.    Table  4  shows 
that as the time difference increases, the estimate of the negative elasticity becomes more clear.
