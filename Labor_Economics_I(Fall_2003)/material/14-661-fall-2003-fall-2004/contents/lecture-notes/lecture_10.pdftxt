1 The economics of immigration

A large and contentious literature studies immigration and the labor market. There are at least

four central questions in this literature:

1. Who decides to immigrate, and how do they decide where to go? This is the topic of the

Borjas 1987 AER article.

2. How do immigrants fare in the labor market relative to natives?

3. What aﬀect do immigrants have on natives (use of public resources, wage structure

changes, contributions to aggregate or per-capita GDP)?

4. What aﬀect do immigrants have on the wage structure?

The last question is actually just a subset of the third, but it’s the most contentious of the

literature. We’ll focus on this question for this lecture. But ﬁrst some background.

See Table 1 of Friedberg and Hunt (1995, Journal of Economic Perspectives ). Immigration

is a ma jor feature of Western economies. Immigrants range from a low of 0.7 percent in Finland

to a high of 28.4 percent in Luxembourg. The U.S. in 1991 was 7.9 percent, which puts it above

the median but below the mean.

Many countries have also seen large increases in immigration in recent decades, and much

more can be expected. Figure I from Friedberg and Hunt (1995) shows the incredibly sharp

changes in ﬂows in the United States. Starting in the 1980s, immigrant ﬂows to the U.S. rose

dramatically. See Table 1 of Borjas JEL 1994. Although the share of U.S. population that

is foreign born was much lower in 1990 than in 1890, immigration ﬂow as a percentage of

population growth (births + immigrants - deaths - emigrants) in 1990 was at its highest level

in 1990 since 1911. Immigration is understandably a sub ject of public debate and economic

analysis.

Adding to the U.S. controversy, recent wave of immigrants are distinctly diﬀerent from

the large waves of European immigrants at the turn of the century. As Table 2 of Friedberg

and Hunt shows, there has been a sharp increase in immigration from less-educated countries

(Mexico, and South America) but also Asia, which is relatively highly educated. The education

2

gap between Mexican and South American immigrants and average U.S. citizens is probably

fairly large, even relative to the European immigration wave of a century ago. (Europeans were

not especially educated, but nor were Americans at that time.) In fact, a striking statistic is

that is not given in any of these articles is that a very large share of the less educated U.S.

work force is not native born.

In 2000, 36 percent of U.S. high school dropouts who were

participating in the labor market were foreign born (my calculations from the 2000 CPS). If

the sample were restricted to high immigration states like New York, Texas, California and

Florida, these shares would be far higher.

It’s thus no surprise that economists have focused analysis on the question of how immigrant

ﬂows aﬀect native wages. The diﬃculty in analyzing these eﬀects is that this is a general

equilibrium question. How might ﬂows of immigrants into a given area aﬀect wages of natives?

Depends upon:

• Size of immigrants ﬂows
• Substitutability between natives and immigrants
• Relative abundance of natives in diﬀerent skill, education, occupation and/or experience
groups

• Integration of the ‘host’ labor market with other markets. In the extreme case, perfect
integration with other labor or product markets can mean that there are no local eﬀects

of local immigration since these aﬀects are entirely mediated through general equilibrium

impacts on the larger market (this follows from trade theory; if economies are perfectly

integrated, then local quantities are unrelated to local prices — the law of one world price

for all factors will prevail).

So, this is not a standard ‘program evaluation’ problem. Moreover, the endogeneity problems

typically associated with program evaluation are at a greater level of aggregation here. “The

locational choices of immigrants and natives presumably depend on expected labor market

opportunities. Immigrants tend to move to cities where the growth in demand for labor can

accommodate their supply. Even if a new immigrants cluster in only a few cities (as they do

3

in the United States), inter-city migration of natives will tend to oﬀset the adverse eﬀects of

immigration.” (Card, 1990, ILRR). Hence, simply correlating immigrant densities with native

wages is unlikely to be informative about causal parameters.

2 Card 1990, ILRR

Card’s inﬂuential 1990 study uses the ‘natural experiment’ (a term that has since gone out of

vogue) of the arrival of 125,000 Cuban immigrants in Miami between May to September 1980 to

study the labor market impacts of immigrant ﬂows. This increased the size of the Miami labor

force by 7% in a remarkably brief period of time. Card’s idea is a simple diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence

comparison of wages and unemployment rates of ethnic groups between Miami and four other

high immigration cities: Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles, and Tampa-St. Petersburg. (In fact,

there are no regression equations in the paper, and few actual regression coeﬃcients.)

• Table 1 shows that, based on education and occupation, Cubans are more likely to com-
pete with Hispanics and blacks than whites.

• Table 2 shows that Mariel Cubans are much less educated and earn substantially less (34
log points) than other Cubans. Note that there are only 50 Cubans in this special 1985

CPS supplement.

• Tables 3 - 5 show simple means.
• Table 6 shows raw and regression adjusted comparisons of wages, employment/population,
and unemployment among all and low-educated blacks in Miami relative to the 4 other

chosen cities. There is evidence that black wages, emp/pop, and unemployment in Miami

all take a turn for the worse relative to blacks in other cities. But, this does not start

until 1982 and has reversed by 1985. So, this makes it doubtful that it can be attributed

to Mariel.

• Two general problems here: 1) there is almost no ‘pre’ period to get a baseline prior to
Mariel. This is because the CPS MORG does not become available until 1979; 2) the U.S.

experiences a severe recession from 1980 to 1983, and this makes all wage and employment

4

numbers highly variable. Hence, we don’t have a good sense of what magnitude of causal

eﬀect we could reliably detect.

• Table 7 examines the eﬀects of the Mariels on wages of Cubans. The real wage of Miami
Cubans falls by 9 log points between 1979 and 1985. But, regression adjustment predicts

a fall of 6 log points simply due to composition. So, the remaining 3 points could be a

price eﬀect, but it is small.

• The ﬁnal column of Table 7 compares Miami Mariels to Cubans in the rest of the U.S.
The wage gap between Miami Cubans and other Cubans does increase by 14 log points.

Regression adjusted, this is still 9 log points. But the big jump is from 1984 to 1985!

Ignoring 1985, any other diﬀerence between Miami and rest-of-U.S. Cubans appears to

be due to compositional changes; Mariel Cubans were less educated and so earned lower

wages. Adjusting for these diﬀerences, the gap is quite stable from 1979 to 1984.

2.1 Interpretations

Card’s results were quite striking and unexpected — certainly to the black Miami residents who

rioted in 1980, in part because of grievances over labor market competition from Cubans. Card’s

paper moved the literature. It shifted priors on the eﬀect of immigration on labor markets and

it helped to popularize the use of natural experiments and diﬀ-in-diﬀ techniques.

Why did immigration not have an eﬀect in the Mariel ‘experiment’ — or at least not a

detectable one?

1. One possibility is a reduction in native inﬂows to Miami. From 1970 to 1980, the Miami

population grew at 2.5% per year while the rest of Florida grew at 3.9%. After April 1,

1980, the growth rate in Miami slowed to 1.4% per year, while the rest of the state declined

to only 3.4%. Notably, Miami still received a disproportionate share of new immigrants

in this time. Thus, it appears that natives and older immigrants were deterred from

migrating to Miami. So, this is a type of general equilibrium response that would mute

the local impact of native inﬂows. It implies that a national impact may have occurred,

but would have been undetectable.

5

2. Another explanation is that Miami was extremely well set up to absorb Cuban immi-

grants. There are numerous Cuban employment and social networks in Miami; the indus-

try/occupation structure has high demand for their skills (endogenous to the fact that so

many are already there); and the city has been doing this kind of thing for decades.

3. A third possibility is that this is not a high-powered test. As noted above, we don’t really

have a good sense of how much these variables (employment, unemployment wage levels)

bounce around from year to year, especially in small samples, so we may have less ability

to detect small eﬀects than we might assume. Moreover, the diﬀ-in-diﬀ assumption — i.e.,

that the other four cities would have behaved similarly to Miami but for the Mariel boat

lift — is not infallible. What if those other cities experienced other shocks? Or, if there

is enough normal city-level variation in these outcomes that we cannot be comfortable

making the ‘but for’ assumption.

Some evidence on this point is provided in Angrist and Krueger’s (excellent) 1999 Hand-

book of Labor Economics chapter. They consider the ‘Mariel Boat Lift that Didn’t

Happen.’ In the summer of 1994, tens of thousands of Cubans boarded boats destined for

Miami for a 2nd boatlift. Wishing to avoid the political fallout, the Clinton administra-

tion interceded and had these intended immigrants diverted to Guantanamo Bay. Angrist

and Krueger perform an ‘event study’ like Card’s study using the non-event to evaluate

the diﬀ-in-diﬀ counterfactual: absent the inﬂux of immigrants, these cities would have

otherwise moved similarly. The disturbing answer is that the data come perilously close

to showing that the ‘Mariel Boat Lift that Didn’t Happen’ raised the black unemployment

rate in Miami by 6.3 percentage points (t = 1.70). See A&K Figure I, Table 4, and Table

7.

4. A ﬁnal possibility is that Miami cannot realistically be treated as an autarkic labor market.

Labor or product market integration between Miami and the rest of the U.S. may dissipate

any local eﬀects through general equilibrium adjustments. In fully integrated economies,

local factor supply changes have no eﬀect on local goods prices — rather, the law of one

price prevails for each good. In this case, there is no strong presumption that the Mariel

boat lift should aﬀect the Miami labor market more than it aﬀects the four comparison

6

cities; there is no ‘control’ city that can be used for the diﬀ-in-diﬀ.

This ﬁnal criticism — that the Mariel experiment is unsuitable for learning about the eﬀects

of immigration on the labor market — sparked a lively debate between proponents and critics

of ‘area studies’ analyses. The Card paper takes the ‘area studies’ approach. But many econo-

mists, most vocally Borjas, have argued that general equilibrium spill-overs make these results

meaningless. One of the arguments levied against the area studies analyses is that natives will

out-migrate in response to immigration, meaning that the net eﬀect of immigration on factor

supplies could be zero (even ignoring product market integration). Card refers to this idea

sardonically as the ‘skating rink mobility model,’ whereby each immigrant who skates into an

area knocks one native oﬀ the ice.

Card acknowledges this possibility in his ILRR paper. But his 2001 AER P&P paper

with John DiNardo takes a direct whack at this argument. Figures 1 and 2 of that paper

show that, to a ﬁrst approximation, a 1 immigrant increase in the low-skill population in an

MSA (Metropolitan Statistical Area) increases the total low-skill population by about 1 over

the 1980-1990 period. This suggests that area studies analyses are not completely (or even

mostly) ‘undone’ by out-migration. This does not exclude GE eﬀects through product market

integration, however.

The counterpoint to area studies are analyses that attempt to a more explicitly GE approach.

One well know example is Borjas, Freeman and Katz (1997) in Brookings. But these studies

are not so much empirical analyses as simulations: given a production function and an estimate

of the elasticity of substitution between immigrants and natives, what does an increase in

immigration of size X imply for native wages? With some justiﬁcation, Angrist calls this

approach ‘feeding the numbers to the theory.’ Can we do better?

Yes. The two recent studies on immigration and the labor market in the QJE, one by

Friedberg in 2001 and the second by Borjas in 2003, both present compelling GE ‘experiments.’

Surprisingly, they reach quite diﬀerent conclusions.

7

3 Friedberg, 2001, QJE

Immigration increased Israel’s population 12 percent between 1990 and 1994 after emigration

restrictions were lifted in the Soviet Union. (See Figure I.) This seems another great possibility

for an event study. Unlike the Mariel case, this inﬂux was large relative to the national labor

market. So, there could easily be a measurable GE eﬀect. But we still have the problem of ‘no

control group.’

Idea: use occupations as unit of analysis. Did the occupations that Russian Jews diﬀeren-

tially entered experience diﬀerential declines in wages? The assumption needed to make this

work is that there is limited occupational mobility so that workers don’t simply enter a new

occupation when wages fall.

Friedberg takes three approaches to estimating this relationship:

1. Estimating cross-section correlations between immigrant occupational penetration and

wage levels. This is not likely to be satisfactory since immigrants might diﬀerentially

enter low-wage occupations.

2. Estimate ‘change’ regressions: ∆Wagej = α + β∆Immigrantsj + εj , where j indexes oc-
cupations. This seems much more appealing, especially over a short time interval. But

occupational choice could be endogenous.

3. To purge endogeneity, use self-reported occupation in the Soviet Union as an instrument

for occupation in Israel. This seems like a reasonable idea.

• See Table II. The ﬁrst two approaches yield large, negative associations between immi-
grant occupational entry, r, and wages. The ﬁrst (cross-sectional) estimate is not too

convincing, but the latter seems plausible enough.

• The 1st column shows the 1st stage relationship between Russian occupation and Israeli
occupation. It’s not especially strong. The coeﬃcient of 0.24 (t = 2.8) shows a surpris-

ingly weak relationship between source and host country occupation (note that if this

relationship were perfect, the coeﬃcient would be 1.0).

8

• More puzzlingly, the reduced form relationship is positive. That is, entry into Israel of
immigrants who were employed in a given occupation while in Russia is associated with

rising wages in the Israeli occupation. This would almost seem to suggest endogenous

self-selection of Russians to Israel based on trends in occupational wages within Israel.

Or it’s possible that wages in these occupations were already rising. It would be nice to

control for pre-period trends (or ‘diﬀerence’ these out).

• Given this positive reduced form, the IV estimates are also positive, albeit insigniﬁcant.
• Table III conﬁrms these ﬁndings using individual level data.
• Table IV presents some robustness checks.
• Table V checks for native disemployment eﬀects by occupation. These go the same way
as the wage estimates: negative for OLS, positive for IV.

Hence, the conclusion is that large immigrant ﬂows do not harm either wages or employment

of natives. I ﬁnd this set of results intriguing but quite puzzling. We would normally expect

the opposite:

immigrants would tend to endogenously select into occupations with growing

wages and employment. This simultaneity would attenuate the estimated negative impact of

immigration on native wages or employment. By this logic, the IV estimates should be more

negative than OLS estimates. What is the source of endogeneity that causes OLS estimates to

be more negative than IV estimates?

4 Borjas, 2003, QJE

The Friedberg potentially addresses the general equilibrium concern posed by ‘area studies’

papers. In theory, it also addresses the endogeneity concern: forward looking immigrants enter

labor markets where their skills are in demand, and hence migration decisions are endogenous.

On the other hand, this study uses kind of a strange instrument. Occupations are not labor

markets, and depending upon elasticities of substitution/complementarity, it’s not entirely clear

how ﬂows into one occupation should aﬀect wages in another. With only two occupations, this

is easy. With numerous occupations, it is not.

9

It might be nice to have a GE ‘experiment’ where we do not have to instrument labor

force categories (such as occupation) because these categories are arguably exogenous. For

example, immigrants cannot readily change their education and potential experience (i.e., age

minus education minus 6) in response to labor market conditions. So perhaps the education

and experience of immigrants can be viewed as exogenous. But that brings us back to the

‘feeding numbers to the theory’ problem. With a small number of education categories, we’re

not going to get any meaningful identiﬁcation from exploiting changes in immigrant supplies

by education. Which brings us to Borjas 2003.

Borjas makes use of the observation that workers of the same education but of diﬀerent

age or experience are unlikely to be perfect substitutes. For example, Welch (1979, JPE ) and

Card and Lemieux (1999, QJE ) both present evidence that within an education group, young

workers are closer substitutes for one another than are young and old workers. Hence, if it

were the case that the immigrant ﬂow is not only concentrated among certain education groups

(high school dropouts in recent years), but also concentrated among experience groups within

education groups, we would potentially have many more quasi-independent data points with

which to achieve identiﬁcation. Based on this idea, Borjas conducts an analysis of the impact of

immigration on native earnings in cells deﬁned by decade (1960 - 2000), education (4 groups),
and 5-year-potential-experience groups. Hence, there are 5 × 4 × 8 = 160 cells.
• Figure I of Borjas tells an important part of the story:
1. During the 1980 - 2000 period, immigrants became an increasingly signiﬁcant share

of U.S. labor supply.

2. The growth was most concentrated among high school dropouts. By the year 2000,

50 percent of young high school dropouts were foreign born.

3. Immigrants tend to be younger than other workers, and this is particularly true for

recent and less educated immigrants. (Note that experience is calculated as potential

rather than actual experience.)

• Borjas’ basic immigrant labor supply measure is:
Mij t
pij t =
Mij t + Nij t

,

10

where M refers to weeks of labor supply by immigrant workers, N is weeks of labor supply

by native workers, and i, j, t index education group, experience, and time.

• Table II makes the case that experience groups are imperfect substitutes. Within educa-
tion groups, immigrants and natives have far more similar occupational distributions if

they are at the same experience level than if they are at diﬀerent experience levels. (This

similarity index is like a correlation coeﬃcient.)

• Figure II lends support to the basic story of a negative sloping relationship between
immigrant supply and native wages. This ﬁgure summarizes the identifying variation of

the entire paper, and it strengthens the argument considerably.

• The basic regression model is as follows

yij t = θpij t + si + xj + π t + (si × xj ) + (si × π t ) + (xj × π t ) + εij t .
This model contains main eﬀects for schooling, experience, and time, plus a full set

2nd order interactions for schooling by experience, schooling by time, and experience
by time. The (si × xj ) interactions control for diﬀerences in the experience proﬁle by
schooling group; the (si × π t ) terms control for changes in the return to schooling; and
the (xj × π t ) terms control for changes in the overall return to experience. Hence, what
is left for identiﬁcation is immigration and wage changes within education-by-experience

cells over time. You can think of this as a triple-diﬀerence strategy.

• Table III has initial results. These coeﬃcients are diﬃcult to interpret b/c they don’t
have a natural scale as parameterized. What they give is

So, deﬁne

∂ ln wij t
∂ (Mij t/ (Mij t + Nij t ))

= ˆθ

mij t = Mij t/Nij t ,

which is the ratio of immigrants to natives in a cell. Then, ∂ ln wij t/∂mij t is the percentage
changes in wages associated with a percentage point change in the immigrant/native ratio.

Some algebra:

¶−2
= ˆθ µ Nij t + Mij t
ˆθ
= ˆθ · (1 + mij t )−2 =
(1 + mij t )2 ,
Nij t
which is a convoluted way to get a readable point estimate. But that’s how the paper is

written.

• Page 1349 says that 1/ (1 + mij t )2 ≈ 0.7. So the Table III coeﬃcients imply that a 10
percent increase in immigrant labor supply reduces native weekly earnings by 4.0 log
points (−0.572 ×0.7), reduces the fraction of time worked by 3.7 log points, and reduces
total native earnings by 6.4 log points.

• Notice also that the eﬀect on log annual earnings is the eﬀect on log weekly earnings
plus the eﬀect on log weeks. Thus, a 10 percent increase in immigrant labor supply must
native reduce weeks worked by 6.4 − 4.0 = 2.4 log points. This is a large disemployment
eﬀect.

• This result also suggests that immigrant labor supply could also potentially be endoge-
nous. Footnote 8 discusses this concern and gives results when immigrant LF participa-

tion is instrumented by immigrant population shares in the relevant education/experience

groups. The point estimates given corroborate the main results. This is an important

ﬁnding and probably deserves more than a footnote.

• Footnote 9 documents that results are roughly similar (though much less precise) when
estimated separately for each pair of decades. This also deserves a table.

• Table IV shows that these results hold within education groups — though not for college
grads.

12

4.1 Link to ‘area studies?’

• A good labor economist takes the literature seriously enough to want to reconcile prior
ﬁndings with her own. In this spirit, Borjas applies his education/experience technique

to a state level wage analysis in Table V. This is the ‘area studies’ approach where the

state is the assumed closed-market geographic area. To the degree that there is interstate

arbitrage of labor market impacts through labor mobility or trade, these estimates should

be smaller in absolute magnitude than those in Table III.

• And they are only 1/3rd of the size! This is a very nice result. Given the presence of sub-
stantial measurement error in the state × education × experience × time cells, however,
it would have been valuable if Borjas had instrumented labor supply with populations

shares as above. As estimated, we cannot tell if the ‘area studies’ estimates are much

smaller because of arbitrage or attenuation.

• A second notable pattern: the point estimates get larger in absolute magnitude when ﬁxed
eﬀects are added for experience × education × time (2-way interactions). This indicates
that the identiﬁcation is coming from the within education-experience over-time compo-

nent of the data. So, it’s speciﬁcally by honing in on the imperfect substitutability of

experience cohorts within education group that this paper obtains such striking ﬁndings.

4.2

Summing up

• The remaining sections of the paper deal ﬁrst deal with the issue of measuring potential
experience among immigrants and then estimate a more ‘structural’ model that speciﬁ-

cally calculates substitution elasticities across education and experience groups. The big

payoﬀ to this work is Table IX, which contains the implied eﬀects of immigration on

native wages. I won’t go through the model in this case due to time, but I will cover a

closely related model by Card and Lemieux (QJE, 2001) in the spring.

• The implied eﬀects on native wages are quite large in this table: −0.089 log points for
high school dropouts, −0.049 for college grads, and −0.032 overall (Q: Is everyone worse
oﬀ ?). It would have been nice to separate these eﬀects further into the 1980s and 1990s,

13

since it was during the 1980s that wages fell particularly rapidly for less-skilled workers,

whereas it appears that high skill immigration was most pronounced in the 1990s.

5 Conclusion

The analysis of the impact of immigration on wages of natives illustrates how a healthy labor

literature evolves. Over the last 15 years, there has been a steady accumulation of good work

on this topic. The ﬁndings have been highly contentious. But the debate has been solidly

grounded in theory and methodology, and not ideology (for the most part). And the scrutiny

each paper has received has advanced the literature. Like the literatures on ‘speciﬁc capital’

and biased-technical change (which we’ll read in the spring), the economics of immigration

literature has made factual, conceptual, and methodological progress on its topic. This is good

for economic understanding, policy, and graduate education...
