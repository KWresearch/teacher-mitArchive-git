1 Why don’t labor markets clear?

• Why is there unemployment?
• In the absence of minimum wages, why aren’t wages bid down suﬃciently by job seekers
so that everyone who wants a job ﬁnds one?

• Can the neoclassical paradigm explain involunary employment?
An answer to these puzzles was famously proposed by Shapiro-Stiglitz in 1984: Unemploy-

ment is driven by the information structure of employment.

Two basic observations undergird their analysis:

1. Unlike other forms of capital, humans can choose their level of eﬀort.

2. It is costly for ﬁrms to determine how much eﬀort workers are exerting.

1.1 Sketch

1. Consider a situation where all workers can receive the market wage and there is no

unemployment.

2. In this case, the worse thing that can happen to a worker is that she will be ﬁred and

instantaneously rehired.

3. There is therefore no penalty for not exerting eﬀort (‘shirking’).

4. To induce workers not to shirk, ﬁrms pay above-market wages. Therefore, job loss imposes

a penalty.

5. But if one ﬁrm pays above-market wages, then presumably they all will.

6. In this case, the incentive not to shirk disappears.

• But unemployment results since wages are above the natural equilibrium level.
• Unemployment creates its own penalty for shirking.

2

7. Hence, the model implies that unemployment and monitoring are substitutes.

8. Consequently, wages serve two functions: allocating labor and providing incentives for

employee eﬀort conditional on employment. As is usually the case when one instrument

is used to solve two problems, this is likely to lead to ineﬃcient outcomes.

1.2 Basic setup

• N identical, risk neutral workers.
• Instantaneous utility is a function of wages and eﬀort ‘normalized’ as:

u(w, e) = w − e.

• e is either 0 or a constant e > 0 (binary, not continuous).
• Unemployed workers receive w ≥ 0 and e = 0.
• b is the exogenous separation rate per unit time.
• r is the intertemporal discount rate.
• The workers ob jective function is therefore
u(w(t), e(t)) exp(−rt)∂ t¸
E ∙Z ∞
0
• The workers choice at any point in time is to exert eﬀort or not. That’s it.
• The odds of getting caught if shirking are q .
• If ﬁred, the worker enters unemployment, waits for a new job.
• Question: What are the odds of ﬁnding a new job if ﬁred (per unit time)?
Answer: Endogenous outcome of the model.

1.3 Asset equations

• Consider a short, discrete time interval: [0, t]. The asset value of employment is

Ve = wt + (1 − rt) [btVu + (1 − bt)Ve ] .

(1)

• Notice that we are for now taking Vu as given. The wt term is the ﬂow of wages, and
the second expression is the discounted value of future outcomes, bearing in mind that
(1 − rt) ≈ exp(−rt).
• Rewriting 1, we have

Ve =

wt + (1 − rt)btVu
1 − (1 − rt)(1 − bt)
wt + btVu − rbt2Vu
rt + bt − rbt2
• Allowing t → 0 (moving into continuous time) gives
w + bVu
r + b ⇒ rVe = w + b(Vu − Ve).
Notice that value of employment is the ﬂow value of the wage minus the capital loss of

=

Ve =

unemployment scaled by its probability.

• We now want to consider this problem separately for a shirker versus non-shirker:
e = w + (b + q)(Vu − V s
rV s
e ),
rV n
e = w − e + b(Vu − V n
e ).

• Rearranging:

and

e =

w + (b + q)Vu
r + b + q

V n
e =

(w − e) + bVu
r + b

(r + b + q).

(3)

• Comparative statics on eﬀort supply and wages. The critical wage must be higher when:
— Eﬀort is more expensive in utility terms (e higher).

— Utility of unemployment is higher.

— Lower probability of being caught shirking (q lower).

— Higher is the interest rate.

— Higher is the exogenous quit rate (b). Why? If you are going to lose your job soon

anyway, why not cheat?

1.5 The firm side

• M identical ﬁrms.
• Production at the ﬁrm level is Qi = f (Li).
• Aggregate production is Q = F (L).
• Assume each worker contributes one until of labor unless she shirks.
• Firms compete by oﬀering wage packages only. No other variables.
• Assume F 0(N ) > e, full employment is eﬃcient.
• The monitoring technology q is exogenous.
• The only way to punish shirkers is therefore to ﬁre them.

1.6 Equilibrium concept

• In equilibrium: Each ﬁrm takes wages and employment levels at other ﬁrms as given, and
ﬁnds it optimal to oﬀer the going wage.
• Firms will obviously pay no more than the NSC wage: w∗ = bw.
• Hence, we’ll have f 0 (Li) = F 0(L) = bw.
• Wages high, workers value jobs for two reasons:
— High wages increase utility.

— Low employment due to high wages, leads to long unemployment spells.

— Firms will lower wages until NSC binds.

• Wages low, workers shirk for two reasons:
— Wages are low, workers only moderately prefer work to unemployment.

— High employment, leads to shorter unemployment spells.

— Firms will raise wages until NSC satisﬁed.

1.7 Endogenizing unemployment

• Now return to the worker’s problem, considering Vu , which we endogenize:

rVu = w + a(Ve − Vu) ,
where a is the job acquisition rate, and w is the unemployment beneﬁt.

(4)

• Q: Where does a come from? Endogenous.
• Q: What must Ve be equal to in equilibrium? V n
e . (It can never be eﬃcient for ﬁrms to
hire workers who shirk. If they shirk ever, they shirk always, so they are unproductive.)

6

• We can now solve 2 and 4 together:
rVe =

(w − e)(a + r) + wb
a + b + r

and

(w − e)a + w(b + r)
a + b + r
• Q: Where did q go? It’s not visible because no one is shirking in equilibrium. But it will
still aﬀect the wage, as will be shown.

rVu =

.

• Plugging back into to the NSC (3), we get
bw ≥ w + e +
• Two additional implications follow:
— Higher unemployment beneﬁt, higher critical wage (of course).

(a + b + r).

(5)

— Higher ﬂows out of unemployment (a), higher critical wage (a critical result).

• Q: Since a is the instantaneous hazard of job acquisition, what is expected time to hire?
A: 1/a.

• Now, a can be solved in terms of parameters of the model.
• What is the equilibrium condition for a?
A: In equilibrium, it must be the case that ﬂows out of unemployment equal ﬂows in.

Hence:

a(N − L) = bL ⇒ a =
• Substituting back into 5, we get
bw ≥ w + e +
• Note that a + b = bL+b(N −L)
N −L = bN
N −L .

• See Figure 1.
• Equation 6 becomes a quasi-labor supply function (really an eﬀort supply function). As
the unemployment rate approaches 0, the critical wage tends toward inﬁnity.

(6)

• See Figure 2.
• In equilibrium, F 0 (L) = bw = w∗ , i.e., where labor demand (MPL) intersects quasi-labor
supply.
• This is a Nash equilibrium because:
— From the ﬁrm’s point of view, there is no point in raising wages. Workers are

providing eﬀort e, and ﬁrm can obtain all the workers it wants at wage w∗ . But
lowering wages would yield shirking.

— From the worker’s viewpoint, unemployment is involuntary. Job seekers strictly

prefer work to unemployment. Would be happy to work at wage w∗ or lower (any
w > e) but cannot credibly commit to work at a lower wage than w∗ .

• Question: What is the core ineﬃciency here? (Costly monitoring)
1.8 Some key results

1. Wages don’t fall enough during recessions to prevent unemployment from rising.

If labor demand shifts inward, this lowers wages. But because wages have fallen, the

probability of shirking has risen. If employment levels (and hence unemployment) remain

the same, workers will therefore shirk. Wages cannot fal l enough to maintain employment

levels at previous state. So, unemployment must rise during recessions.

2. Possible corollary: Wage sluggishness. Moving from one w∗ to another w∗∗ will require
each ﬁrm to repeatedly re-optimize wages in response to shifting unemployment rate.

Firms cannot cut wages until unemployment rises suﬃciently (a coordination problem).

1.9 Welfare analysis: Overview

The outcome solved above is never Pareto eﬃcient. Why not?

1. Each ﬁrm employs too few workers because it faces private cost of hiring w∗ rather than
the social cost — which is equal to what? e. And w∗ > e in all cases.

2. There are also negative externalities. Each ﬁrm increases Vu for all other ﬁrms by hiring.

But the ﬁrst problem clearly dominates since the ‘natural rate of unemployment’ is always

too high.

A subtle point. This second problem is a pecuniary externality (i.e., my demand raises your

prices).

• We don’t normally worry about pecuniary externalities at competitive equilibria. Why
worry here?

• Pecuniary externalities are second order at a Pareto eﬃcient equilibrium (this follows
from the envelope theorem for constrained problems).

• Because this equilibrium is not Pareto eﬃcient, these externalities are ﬁrst order.
1.10 Social planner’s problem

• The social maximization for the problem here is what? (Constrained Pareto eﬃciency.)

:

max(w − e)L s.t.
w ≥ N SC,
wL ≤ F (L).

• Show Figure 4.
• Provided that F 0 (L) > e (as we have assumed), more employment is always socially
eﬃcient.

9

• Hence, the socially eﬃcient equilibrium has
w∗ =

F (L)
L

,

which will correspond to a point where the average product of labor intersects the NSC

quasi-labor supply function.

• But the market equilibrium has F 0 (L) = w∗ .
• Unless F (L) has constant returns to scale, i.e., F 0 (L) · L = F (L), market equilibrium will
not be constrained Pareto eﬃcient and employment is too low.

1.11 Social planning problem: Another surprise

To get to the constrained Pareto eﬃcient outcome, the social planner would have to tax away
pure proﬁts to subsidize wages until w∗ = F (L)
L . But:

• The social planner’s solution will be more socially eﬃcient but will not generate a Pareto
improvement.

• Taxation will make ﬁrms strictly worse oﬀ and workers better oﬀ.
• Unless workers and ﬁrms are the same people, this welfare improvement requires redistri-
bution.

• Hence, this model suggests a violation of the Second Welfare Theorem: eﬃciency and
distribution are not separable problems in this economy.

1.12 Summary

This is a brilliant paper that generated a huge literature. With a simple and sensible set of

assumptions—workers can choose eﬀort; ﬁrms cannot monitor them costlessly—it can potentially

explain:

• Involuntary unemployment (workers seeking jobs at prevailing wages but wages are not
bid down).

10

• Wage rigidity and sluggishness.
• Why recessions raise unemployment.
It also introduce into labor economics a set of tools that reappear in many places, particu-

larly the equilibrium unemployment search models of Mortensen and Pissarides.

Of course, the ‘cost’ of this model is the assumption that workers are ‘rational cheaters’—only

punishment and wages motivate them. A large literature has assessed both the predictions of

the model and the assumptions made on worker maximands. A variety of alternative ‘eﬃciency

wage’ models oﬀer similar predictions but diﬀerent operative assumptions on human behavior.

The Akerlof gift exchange model is an inﬂuential alternative.
