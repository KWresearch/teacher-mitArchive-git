Today  I  introduce  instrumental  variables  in  the  context  of  Angrist  and  Evan’s  AER  paper 
looking at the effects labor supply of women from additional children. 
 
As  in  the  example  presented  last  class, we  can  frame  today’s  question  in  terms  of wanting  to 
know counterfactual outcomes, this time from having an additional child.    
 
Let 

1=iD
0=iD
  indicate  woman  i   has  ‘kids’  and 
conditional  variable  here,  which  leads  to  a  more  intuitive  way  of  interpreting  the  results  as 
iD  can take on more than 2 values.  For 
causal (or not).  Later, I’ll come back to the case when 
iY1   is  woman    i ’s  circumstances  (or  universe)  with 
iY0   is her circumstances without.   To be concrete, suppose  this outcome variable  Y  
is  weeks  worked  in  the  year  i   is  age  40.    So  we  are  looking  at  the  effect  of  children  on 
women’s labor supply.

independent of any other circumstance.  Think of it like a stork randomly dropping off kids off at 
different households: the woman has no choice in this allocation for the purpose of considering 
the  independent  effect).    We  don’t  want  to  mistake  the  analysis  with  reverse  causality:  a 
change in circumstances leads also to a change in the decision to have kids.  
 
The  causal  effect  is  individual  specific.    There  is  no  reason  for  the  effect  to  be  the  same  for 
everyone  and,  indeed,  it  likely  is  not.    Our  static  model  from  last  lecture  suggests  different 
preferences,  opportunity  costs,  and  reservation  wages  will  lead  to  different  changes  in 
behaviour.

Drawing  causal  inferences  from  data  is  the  central  focus  in  applied  labor  economics:  so 
central,  that  most  labor  economists  that  make  causal  conclusions  from  a  set  of  results  use 
more  than  half  the  paper  or  presentation  trying  to  convince  us  that  the  research  design  is 
credible and in fact the omitted variables bias  is negligible.  Most papers are scrutinized on the 
basis  of whether  or  not  this  argument  seems  correct.    Failing  to  account  for  omitted  variables 
bias  or  not  accounting  for  it  well  enough  comes  up  time  and  time  again,  almost  everywhere

conditions  in  social  sciences when we  can  draw  causal  conclusions.    Freeman’s  shoe  leather 
paper provides an excellent critique of this and you are encouraged to read it. 
 
One of the most common approaches  to dealing with  the omitted variables bias  is to add more 
control  variables  to  the  regression.   W ithout  loss of generality,  consider one additional  control. 
Suppose  we  had  a  measure  of  woman  i ’s  years  of  schooling 
iS .    Let’s  again  suppose,  for 
now,  that schooling  is a binary variable  for  the purposes of simplifying what  is being estimated 
and  for  causal  interpretation.    Schooling  is  likely  related  to  the  possible  wage  a  woman  could 
earn  if  she  did work,  and  so may  affect 
iD   negatively.    The  omitted  variable 
iY   positively  and 
iS  out of the regression is negative.  The multivariate regression equation is:

assigned conditional on 

The now weighted omitted variable bias is conditional on the additional control variable.  A bias 
remains  in  estimating  the  (weighted)  average  causal  effect  from  kids  if  any  additional  factors 
are related to having kids and hours worked, among women with the same level of education. 
 
A key question in any regression study is whether selection on observables is enough to make 
the  remaining  OVB  zero.    The  approach  would  clearly  be  acceptable  if 
iD   is  randomly 
iS .   Whether you win  the Green Card  lottery,  for example depends on 
your  nationality,  since  some  nationalities  are  not  eligible.    But  conditional  on  nationality, 
winning  the  Green  Card  is  supposed  to  be  random.    Even  without  random  assignment,  a 
multivariate  regression  approach  might  be  plausible  if  we  know  a  lot  about  the  process 
generating  the  regressor  of  interest,  and we  have  accurately measured  variables  that  capture 
factors behind  this process.   Often, however,  it  is not realistic  to believe we understand human 
behaviour enough  to map out an accurate functional form for 
iD .    In this case, without actually 
having detailed  knowledge of  the process  that determines whether a woman has  kids, we  can 
never be sure we’ve controlled for other factors by adding more covariates.3   
 
The  analysis  for  the  continuous  variable  case  is  analogous.    From  our  original  regression

3 Showing that the estimate of 
 does not change substantially after adding another control variable is 
sometimes used as evidence that the OVB is negligible because umobserved factors correlated with this 
additional variable will be partially accounted for (if the correlation was 1, the left out variable would be 
fully accounted for).  If unobserved variables correlated with the control contributed to a significant 
1β
omitted variables bias, we might expect the estimate of 
 to change after adding the observed control.  
Not seeing this is reassuring, but there could still be other factors not correlated with the added control or 
only weakly correlated that lead to OVB.  For more on this, see Altonjii, Elder, and Taber: “Selection on 
observed and unobserved variables” (unpublished).

And  let me  define

iD   here  as  the  total  number  of  children  woman  i   has.    Angrist  and  Evans 
(1998  AER)  adopt  an  instrumental  variables  approach  to  estimating  the  causal  impact  of 
having kids on women’s labor supply.  An ‘instrument’ is a variable that affects the independent 
variable  of  interest  (in  this  case, 
iD ),  but  that  variable  is  unrelated  to  any  unobserved  factor 
that  we  are  worried  about  which  could  affect 
iY .    Angrist  and  Evans  note  that  when  parents 
often desire  to raise boys and girls.   Parents with  two sons or  two daughters are more  likely  to 
have a  third child (with  the hope  that the  third one will be of  the opposite sex).   This can easily 
be verified and is done in their Table 3. 
 
Suppose we can write this relationship down as: 
 
D

where 

iZ  is equal to 1 if the mother has two boys or two girls,

In  practice,  we  also  would  like  a  strong  correlation  between 

iD and 
iZ .    If,  for  example  fewer 
than 1% of  the women  in our  sample had an additional  child because  their  first  two were both 
girls,  it  could  be  very  hard  to  detect  the  effect  from  the  additional  child  off  of  such  a  small 
sample.   The estimated effect will  tend  to be imprecisely measured.   Weak correlations  lead  to 
measurement error problems (see below).

This  is  called  the  Wald  estimator,  which  provides  a  very  intuitive  way  of  thinking  about  the 
1β  is  simply  the  difference  in 
instrumental  variables  approach.    It  says  the  IV  estimate  for  the 
mean  hours  worked  between  women  with  their  first  2  children  of  the  same  sex  and  those 
without, divided by the difference  in the total number of children between women with their first 

Philip Oreopoulos Labor Economics Notes for 14.661 Fall 2004-05 Lecture 3 

10 

2  children  of  the  same  sex  and  those  without.    If  having  two  same  sex  siblings  is  associated 
with  a  change  in  labor  supply,  and  having  same  sex  children  only  leads  to  an  increase  in  the 
likelihood  of  having  another  child,  then  dividing  this  change  in  labor  supply  by  the  average 
increase  in  children  associated with  having  initially  same  sex  children will  give  us  an  estimate 
of the increase in labor supply from having one additional child. 
 
Causal interpretation of IV 
 
The  IV  estimate  has  an  important  causal  interpretation.  if  we  allow  for  one  more  additional 
assumption.    The  monotonicity  assumption  says  the  instrument  works  only  in  one  direction.  
While an  instrument may have no effect on some  individuals, for those  that do react, either  the 
variable  being  instrumented  becomes  always  larger,  or  always  smaller.    In  our  example,  the 
monotonicity  assumption  clearly  holds,  because  it’s  not  possible  to  have  fewer  children  as  a 
response to having the first 2 children the same sex. 
 
If a valid  instrument and  the monotonicity assumption,  IV estimates capture  the average effect 
of  treatment  on  those  who  change  state  in  response  to  a  change  in  the  instrument.    In  this 
example,  the  IV  approach  estimates  the  average  effect  of  having  an  additional  child  for  those 
women  who  respond  to  having  an  additional  child  because  their  first  2  children  were  of  the 
same sex.  Imbens and Angrist (JASA 94) call this the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE). 
 
Note  that  the  LATE  may  be  very  different  from  the  average  treatment  effect  (ATE)  for  the 
whole population.   While we may be  interested  in  the  labor supply effects  from children  from a 
more  general  population,  IV  allows  for  causal  estimates  among  a  very  particular  subset of  the 
population:  those  affected  by  the  instrument.    It  is  not  correct  to  extrapolate  that  this  average 
effect is also the same for other women in the whole population. 
 
Often,  however,  the  individuals we wish  to  know  the  treatment  effect  for  are  those  affected  by 
the instrument.

This might not be  the case here.   What group of women are we estimating  the LATE for here?  
These  are  women  who  want  both  sex  children  and  are  willing  enough  to  have  an  additional 
child solely for this reason.  Angrist and Evans estimate that, at most,  7% of American women 
had an additional child as a result of sex preferences (table 3).  We are not able to estimate the 
effect  of  children  on  labor  supply,  for  other  93%.    For  example,  the  results will  not  identify  the 
effect  from  ‘accidental’  additional  children.    And  the  results  do  not  identify  the  effect  from  not 
having  any  children  versus  one  child  (this  is  obvious  in  this  example,  because  Angrist  and 
Evan’s sample only looks at families with at least 2 children).  
 
Proof of LATE 
 
We  only  observe  whether  an  individual  has  kids  or  not,  and  whether  the  binary  instrument  is 
zero or not.   For example,  for a woman with a  third child and  the  first  two children of  the same 
sex, we don’t know whether she would have had  that  third child  if  the  first  two children were of 
opposite sex.  Let 
iD1  and 
iD0  denote potential outcomes for 
iD  depending on whether the instrument 
is assigned or not.  We can express the observed outcomes as:

Pitfalls with Instrumental Variables 
 
1) Is the instrument valid? 
 
The assumption  that

cov(

  is  just an assumption  .   Often  in when using  this approach,

i eZ
,
)
the  credibility  of  the  results  will  rest  on  this.    Angrist  and  Evans  show  that  same  sex 
composition  is  uncorrelated with many  observable  background  characteristics  (Table  4).    This 
doesn’t  show  conclusively  that  other  unobserved  variables  are  uncorrelated  with  this 
instrument, but it helps. 
 
2) a ‘weak’ instrument 
 
An  instrumental  variable  is  said  to  be  ‘weak’,  if 

is  small.    We  can  rewrite  the

If there is ANY remaining correlation between the instrumental variable and unobserved factors 
affecting  the  outcome,  then  this  omitted  variables  bias  will  be  exacerbated  by  a  weak 
instrument.    That  is,  a  weak  correlation  between  the  instrument  and  the  independent  variable 
will make the omitted variables bias (if it exists) larger.  Compared to the OLS estimate, if there 
instrument  is  not  completely  valid,  it  is  not  clear whether  the OLS  estimate  or  the  IV  estimate 
will be less biased.  In fact, OLS will give less biased results if:

Thus,  when  using  instrumental  variables,  it  is  always  important  to  justify  your  instrument 
(convince  us  that  it  is  uncorrelated  with  possible  omitted  variables)  and  show  that  the 
relationship between the instrument and the independent variable of interest is significant.   
 
A quick note about using IV with multiple regression. 
 
The  IV  estimator  for  the  simple  regression model  is easily  extended  to  the multiple  regression 
case.   One  key  thing  to  remember  is  that all of  the  independent  variables  (except  the one  you 
are  instrumenting)  must  be  used  in  the  First  Stage.    For  example,  if  the  equation  being 
estimated was:

We  must  include  these  controls  when  estimating  the  effect  the  instrument  has  on  influencing 
the independent variable of interest. 
 
What do Angrist and Evans find? 
 
Table 5 shows results with no additional controls. 
 
Table 7 shows results with controls, and compares OLS results with IV results. 
 
Note,  they also use having  twins after  the  first  child as an  instrument  for having 3  kids  instead 
of 2, but I will not talk much about this. Feel free to read more about it in the paper.
