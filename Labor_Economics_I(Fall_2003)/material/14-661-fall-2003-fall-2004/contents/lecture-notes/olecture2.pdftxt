 
Labor Supply 
 
Where we’re going: 
 
I’m going  to spend about 4 lectures talking about labor supply.  Along the way, I’m going to 
introduce  some econometric  issues and  tools  that we commonly use.   Today’s  lecture and 
probably  some  of  the  next  lecture  will  cover  the  theory  of  static  and  intertemporal  labor 
supply.   
 
You  should  read  Blundell  and  Macurdy’s  Handbook  chapter,  as  well  as  David  Card’s 
critique  of  intertemporal  labor  supply.    The  chapter  in Cahuc  and  Zylberbeg might  also  be 
helpful.  The empirical papers I hope to cover over the next few lectures are: 
 
Eissa and Liebman (QJE 96) (on the earned income tax credit) 
Angrist and Evans (AER 96) (on labor supply of women) 
Card and Robbins (NBER5701) (self sufficiency project experiment) 
And  a  couple  of  papers  on  the  intertemporal  labor  supply  of  cab  drivers  and  bicycle 
couriers 
Gelbach (AER 02) will be covered in the first problem set. 
 
Questions before I start?

Decomposition  of  labor  supply  in  term  of  substitution,  income,  and  endowment 
effects 
 
The  static  (one  period)  model  of  labor  supply  you’ve  seen  before,  probably  in  terms  of  a 
graph, with leisure on the x axis and consumption on the y axis. 
 
The set-up is straightforward: 
 
max
 
where  C  is  consumption,  L  is  leisure  (any  time  spend  not  working),  and  X  are  individual 
attributes. 
 
Utility is quasi-concave, so:

subject to: 
 
w  is  the  wage  rate,  Y  is  non-labor  income,  and  T  is  the  total  time  available,  and  a  single 
sonsumption good is taken as the numeraire (the price of consumption is one). 
 
The ‘price’ of one unit of not working is the wage (opportunity cost). 
 
Note  that  it’s not clear  in  the static model over what  length of  time  is being examined.   Are 
we looking over a week, or a year?  Also, it’s not clear how an individual decides to allocate 
their  time:  by  hours,  or  by  days?    For  now,  let’s  think  of  T  in  terms  of  a  one week  period, 
with the individual deciding whether not to work, or to work in jobs that pay the same wage, 
but for different hours (e.g. part-time or full-time).

Many  studies  in  labor  focus  on  the  response  time  worked  from  changes  in  the  wage.  
Easier  to  go  through  the  response  to  leisure  from  a  change  in wage,  because  leisure  is  a 
‘good’, whereas hours worked is a ‘bad’.  For interior solution:

negative  –  if  the  price  of  leisure  goes  up,  holding  utility  constant,  people  buy  less  leisure.  
We  also  usually  assume  leisure  is  a  normal  good.    If wages  increase,  the  total  amount  of 
things  an  individual  can  ‘buy’  –  consumption  of  leisure,  goes  down.   So  this  income  effect 
is  negative.    Both  effects  are  negative,  so  this  gives  us  the  standard  result  that  the

We  have  the  substitution  effect,  the  income  effect  and  the  endowment  effect.    The 
endowment effect leads individual to take more leisure, since a rise in the wage rate makes 
them overall richer (the income effect is smaller than the endowment effect). 
 
Note  the  difference  between  this  result  and  that  from  conventional  demand  theory,  which 
only  includes  income  and  substitution  effects  (which  are  both  negative  if  the  good  with  a 
price  increase  is  a  normal  good).    The  conventional  case  concerns  goods  that  are 
consumed, not  sold – no endowments.   Here, an  individual not only consumes  leisure, but 
also may ‘sell’ it to obtain a wage, to obtain consumable goods. 
 
The  main  point  of  the  static  model  is  to  show  that  the  response  from  a  wage  change  is 
ambiguous  –  there  is  both  a  positive  and  a  negative  effect,  and  it  is  not  clear  which  one 
dominates, and under what circumstances. 
 
For  prime  age  men,  most  evidence  indicates  that  the  income  effect  dominates  (men  tend 
to  work  less  from  an  increase  in  wage).    For women  and  others with  currently  lower  labor 
force  participation,  the  response  to  an  increase  in  wage  tends  to  generate  more  of  a 
response towards working more hours.   
 
Note,  the  response  is  not  ambiguous  if  an  individual  is  currently  not working.   An  increase 
in the wage will lead to a zero or positive increase  in hours worked.  Individuals that work a

5 

little are more likely to have the substitution effect dominate the income effect.  The less an 
individual works, the smaller the income and endowment effects are. 
 
This is useful to know in practice, because many empirical studies suggest that movements 
in  labor  supply  are  principally  owing  to  variations  in  the  participation  rate,  and  that  the 
elasticity  of  the  supply  of  female  labor,  especially  that  of  married  women,  is  greater  than 
that of men.

with  respect  to  wages.    Note  the  endogeneity  problem  (or  the  omitted  variables  problem): 
clearly  there may  be many  factors  that  affect  both wages  and  hours worked.   We will  look 
at some ways of addressing this shortly. 
 
A  few  interesting  points  arise  from working with  this  simple model  –  you  can  just as easily 
realize these points by working through the graphical version of the static model. 
 
1)  the  elasticity  of  supply  of  labor  depends  individually  on  preferences  for  leisure  and 
consumption, as well as individual circumstances (e.g. with children, without). 
 
2) Differences in responses to wage changes may be driven purely by differences in tastes 
(because the indifference curves take on different shapes). 
 
3)  static  model  assumes  wages  are  parameters  (that  don’t  change  when  other 
characteristics  change),  but  clearly  this  is  not  the  case.    Perhaps  as  a  first  approximation,  
or for simplification, it’s OK.

Incorporating taxes, transfers, welfare, and lump sum costs to working into model: 
 
If  taxes  and  transfers  do  not  affect  the  shape  of  indifference  curves  (a  reasonable 
assumption,  but  one  discussed  more  by  Killingsworth),  then  introduction  of  taxes  or 
transfers  merely  alters  the  shape  of  the  individual’s  budget  line.    Similarly,  we  might  also 
consider  one  time  costs  associated  with  working  or  not  working  (e.g.  transportation  costs, 
day  care  costs,  welfare,  …).    If  additions  only  affect  the  budget  line,  the  analysis  is  the 
same as before, except the budget line looks slightly different.  Specifically,  
 
=
YC
 
where welf  is welfare payments if not working, τ is the tax rate of work, and LC is the labor 
costs  with  working.    Since  the  budget  constraint  is  now  discontinuous,  it’s  a  pain  to  derive 
the  first  order  conditions.    It’s  a  lot  easier  just  to  consider  how  these  changes  affect  the 
budget constraint graphically (see Killingsworth for a discussion) 
 
Note,  the  response  to  a  transfer  or  tax  depends  both  how  the  revenue  raised  via  those 
taxes  is  used.    Even  if  we  focus  on  situations  where  revenue  raised  to  make  transfer 
payments  to  other  individuals,  the  effect  of  a  tax  on  individuals  is  still  ambiguous  because 
of  substitution  and  income/endowment  effects.    Just  as  the  effect  from  lowering  the wage 
was  ambiguous,  so  too  is  the  effect  from  increasing  taxes.   On  the  one  hand,  the  price  of 
leisure is reduced, making it more likely to reduce employment.  On the other hand, income 
is  reduced,  making  leisure  less  attractive  (if  leisure  is  a  normal  good).    The  response  will 
also depend on people’s tastes. 
 
Therefore,  the  aggregate,  overall,  response  from  a  change  in  the  budget  constraint  will 
depend  on  many  things,  and  the  overall  (average)  effect  on  labor  supply  is  a  priori 
unknown.  It’s an empirical question, one that we will look at shortly below.

Transfer  programs  tend  to  generate  disincentives  to  work.    Introducing  a  guaranteed 
welfare  amount  has  an  unambiguous  affect  on  the  incentive  to  work.    Suppose  we

The marginal tax rate for a non worker,  in this case,  is 1.  For those affected by introducing 
the guarantee, the effect in unambiguous in leading these workers to stop working. 
 
An  example  of  a  program  not  as  extreme  is  a  negative  income  tax.    The  general  set-up 
considers both a guarantee and a subsidy to work.  The subsidy is: 
 
−

We  can  describe  the  effects  of  the  NIT  graphically,  or  we  can  sign  the  effects  more 
explicitly  from  the slutsky equation (show  first on graph).    In effect, what’s happened  is  two 
simultaneous  changes:  a  shift  in  Y  by  G,  and  a  fall  in  wages  by  –tw  (for  those  with

both  terms  are  negative  if  leisure  is  a  normal  good.    The  effect  is  unambiguous  because

Empirical Example 1: 
The Self-Sufficiency Project Experiment 
 
The  self-sufficiency  project  was  started  in  1991  designed  to  explore  such  a  program.    In 
1991,  the SRDC collected a  list of all long-term single parent welfare recipients (on welfare 
for  at  least  1  year)  in  Vancouver  and  rural  New  Brunswick  (in  Canada).    They  randomly 
selected  half  of  these  people  on  this  list  and  invited  them  to  participate  in  a  work  subsidy 
program.    The  SSP  offered  a  temporary,  but  generous  earnings  supplement  to  these 
selected single parents.   To  take advantage of  the supplement offer,  the  individuals had  to 
begin  working  full  time  (30  hours  or  more  per  week)  and  stop  receiving  welfare  within  a 
year  of  being  offered  the  supplement.    The  supplement  was  paid  on  top  of  earnings.  
Those who were eligible to receive it could do so for up to three years after finding full-time 
work, as long as they were still working full time and not recieiving welfare. 
 
The  supplement  is  calculated  as  half  the  difference  between  a  participants  earnings  from 
employment  and  $37,000.    So  the  supplement  is  reduced  by  50  cents  for  every  dollar  of 
increased earnings: 
 
++
wC
 
<draw on board> 
 
As  an  example,  a  single  parent with  two  children  in  Vancouver  received  $17,111  annually 
in  social  assistance  (welfare)  in  1991.    If  they  obtained  a  job  working  35  hours  at  $7  an 
hour  and  worked  52  weeks,  their  annual  income  would  be  $12,740,  much  less  than 
welfare!!  Unless there was utility from working, static model predicts unambiguously parent 
would  not  work.    The  work  subsidy  from  the  program  is  $12,130,  so  if  the  parent 
participated  in  the program, she would earn  instead $24,870.  In general, most participants 
faced  incomes  $3,000-$7,000  higher,  when  including  the  subsidy,  compared  to  welfare 
incomes.

One  thing  we  might  like  to  know  is  the  effect  of  the  program  on  every  participant.    Let’s 
iD   as  an  indicator  for  whether  a  participant  i   was  selected  to  receive  the  subsidy, 
define 
1=iD
0=iD
,  or  not, 
.    Let 
iY1   be woman  i ’s  circumstances  (hours worked, welfare  status, 
1=iD
iY0   be  her 
  (say,  for  example,  3  years  into  the  program),  and 
family  health,  etc…)  if 
circumstances  otherwise.    Assume  both  these  potential  outcomes  are  well  defined  for 
everyone.   The problem  is, only one  is ever observed  for each woman.   Formally,  this  can 
be expressed by writing the observed outcomes, 
iY , as:

We  cannot  know  the  counterfactual  outcome  for  each  woman  without  being  able  to 
observe  alternate  universes  (which  we  can’t).    Instead,  the  Self-sufficiency  project  tries  to 
estimate  the  average  effect  on  participants  using  observed  outcomes  only.    If  we  simply 
take the difference in mean outcomes between those selected and those not, we get:

and  because  participants  are  randomly  assigned,  which  means 

iD   is  independent  of  any

participants  selected  is  the  same  as  the  expected  outcome  for  participants  not  selected  .  
Expected  outcomes  are  the  same  for  both  groups,  conditional  on  program  assignment.

Assignment  to  T  is  random,  so  there  is  no  omitted  variables  bias:  v  is  independent  of  T, 
and  the  sample  is  conditional  on  being  a  single  parent,  and  on  welfare  for  at  least  one 
year. 
 
The  counterfactual  is  obvious:  what  would  have  happened  had  the  treatment  not  been 
given, and the average effect for the population is identified. 
 
Expected effects: 
 
The  wage  rate  for  working  full  time  is  being  subsidized.    The  anticipated  effect  over  the  3 
year  period  the  program  is  offered  is  unambiguously  zero  or  positive,  since  there  is  no 
short-run income effect among the population.  But here’s where the intertemporal model is 
useful:  it  reminds  us  that  the  program  is  short  term,  and  the  effect  of  the  program  is 
transitory.    Lifetime wealth  increases  as  a  result  of  the  program,  for  those  that  participate.  
The  effect  of  labor  supply  after  the  subsidy  runs out  is ambiguous,  since  there  is a  (small) 
wealth  effect  spread  out  over  the  lifetime.    What  is  interesting  is  that  the  model  predicts 
once the subsidy goes away,  individuals that did change their  labor supply should reduce it 
once the subsidy has ended, maybe even to levels lower than the control group.

It is interesting to note that only 30% of those treated decided to switch to working full time, 
compared  to 15% of the control group in the first year of the study.  Therefore, many in the 
treatment  group  did  not  take  up  the  subsidy,  and  analyzing  the  labor  supply  dynamics  of 
the program are  confounded by  including  the part of  the  treatment group  that was eligible, 
but did not participate. 
 
Another way  to examine  the experiment  is  to  focus on  the  ‘Treatment of  the  treated’.   That 
is,  to  focus  on  just  the  effects  of  those  that  did  take  up  the  program,  among  those  who 
were  eligible.    It’s  crucial  to  note  that  the  characteristics  of  this  group  are  unlikely  to  be 
similar  to  the  characteristics  of  the  control  group,  so  any  analysis  of  the  treatment  of  the 
treated must be treated with this understanding of likely omitted variables bias. 
 
Figure  3.4  shows  the  effect  of  the  treatment  on  the  treated  over  time.    Obviously  the  full 
time  employment  for  this group will  initially  increase  to almost 100%, by definition of  those 
who  took  up  the  program.    But  now  notice  how  quickly  the  fall  in  full  employment  among 
them  occurs  –  almost  20  percentage  points  over  the  3  years,  compared  to  a  slow,  but 
steady  rise  for  those  that  did  not  take  up  the  program.    Note,  the  slower  change  in 
employment  between  the  control  group  and  the  treated  group  that  did  not  take  up  the 
program indicates the potential that these groups are different. 
 
Figure  6.1.   What  is  interesting  is  how  relatively  small  the  labor  supply  decrease  occurred 
following  immediately  after  the  drop  in  subsidies.    I  would  have  expected  to  see  a  larger 
reaction.    On  the  other  hand,  by  the  time  the  subsidy  was  removed,  the  treatment  group 
had no different employment rates than the control group, which is generally what would be 
expected  from  the  theory,  if  wealth  effects  were  small.    It  seems  the  overall  effect  of  the 
program was to increase the speed at which welfare parents took up full-time employment. 
 
Analyzing  the  program.   Should  this  program  be  adopted?    Tables  7.4  and  7.5  look  at  the 
benefits  and  costs  of  the  program.    For  individuals  that would  have  stayed  on welfare, but

instead  work  with  the  subsidy,  the  cost  is  less  to  subsidize  than  for  welfare.    But  the 
program also subsidizes  individuals  that would have started  full  time employment anyway - 
for  these  individuals  (wind-fall  recipients),  the  program  cost  even  more.    Targeting  only 
long-term  welfare  recipients  and  requiring  fulltime  employment  for  take-up  helps minimize 
the  number  of  wind-fall  recipients,  but  the  study  reveals  that  overall,  this  program  costs 
more  –  the  5-year  per  program  group member  cost  for  the  treatment  group  was  $40,000, 
whereas  for  the  control group  it was $37,000  (ignoring administrative  costs).    If we  include 
additional earnings as a benefit (payment for value added), then we might be able to justify 
program – earnings were, on average, about $4,000 higher for the treatment group than for 
the  control.    But  this  analysis  completely  ignores  redistributional  issues:  the  earnings  are 
received  by  the  participant,  the  subsidy  is  received  by  the  participant,  and  the  costs  are 
born by the tax-payer. 
 
A  variation  of  this  program  might  lower  overall  costs  if  it  could  do  a  better  job  targeting 
those that would have stayed on welfare otherwise.  It would be interesting to see the same 
program set up  for only  those with at  least 2 years on welfare (not clear what results would 
show,  however).    Another  consideration  is  that  if  this  program  was  introduced,  it  might 
provide  incentive  to  stay  on  welfare  longer.    A  separate  sample  for  the  SSP  was  carried 
out,  where  a  random  sample  from  a  group  of  welfare  recipients  with  less  than  1  year  on 
welfare was  told  they would  be  eligible  for  the  program  if  they were  still  on welfare  after  a 
year.  Interestingly, Card, Robins, and Lim find minimal effects. 
 
 
 
 
What were  the effects of  the self-sufficiency project?    Introducing  the program  led  to about 
a 25 percentage point rise  in  full-time employment rate relative to the control group (from 5 
to  30%).   Note  that  about  70%  of  those  on welfare  didn’t  react  to  the  program  at  all.   Five 
years  into  the experiment,  the control group had caught up: about  the same percentage of 
welfare  recipients  were  employed  full  time  in  both  groups  (about  30%).    So  the  program 
seems  to  have  had  a  very  large  effect  in making  some welfare  recipients  start work  early,

but  little  long-run  effect.    Strong  tendency  to  stay  on  welfare  even  if  offered  very  large 
financial incentive to work.  Interesting to know why.
