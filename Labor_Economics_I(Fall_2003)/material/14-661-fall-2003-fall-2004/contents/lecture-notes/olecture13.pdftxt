Compulsory Schooling, Dropout Behavior, and Alternatives to the Human Capital Model 
 
Compulsory  school  laws  mandate  the  minimum  length  of  time  a  child  must  spend  in  school  before 
having  the  option  to  leave.    These  laws  have  been  around  for  a  long  time.    Many  industrialized 
countries  introduced  them  more  than  a  hundred  year  ago,  and  since  then,  they’ve  been  updated 
often.    Most  recently,  for  example,  many  states  have  implemented  or  are  considering  raising  the 
minimum  school  leaving  age  to  18.    A  number  of  papers  have  used  compulsory  schooling  as  an 
instrument to measure the causal effects of education.  They seem to be potentially good instruments 
in that they seem likely to be correlated with schooling (by definition, they are intended to raise school 
attainment)  and  not  be  correlated  with  ability  or  other  cost  factors,  since  they  are  imposed  on 
everyone, whether or not they want to leave school early. 
 
There are two types of compulsory school law instruments. 
 
1) Day of birth 
 
Angrist  and Krueger  (1991)  exploit  differences  in  school  starting ages  together with  a  fixed minimum 
school  leaving age  to  identify potentially exogenous variation  in  the minimum exposure  to class  time.  
In  states  with  a  December  31st  cutoff  for  starting  school,  children  born  near  the  end  of  a  year  enter 
school  at  5 ¾  while  students  born  near  the  start  of  the  year  enter  school  around  6 ¾.   Students  are 
typically  allowed  to  leave  as  soon  as  they  reach  their  16th  birthday.    Therefore,  students  differ  in  the 
minimum  length of  time  they must  spend  in school before having  the option  to  leave  (between 0 and 
12 months). 
 
Figure  1  of  Angrist  and  Krueger  JEP  Fall  2001  shows  nicely  their  identification.    They  estimate 
Mincerian returns to education of about 8 – 10%  
 
2) State/regional dropout ages

Changes  to  the  dropout  age  may  also  provide  an  instrument  for  estimating  causal  effects  of 
education.    If  all  states  raised  the  dropout  age  at  the  same  time,  we  would  have  a  discontinuity  in 
education  restrictions, but might have a hard  time discerning whether changes or  trends  in schooling 
and earnings around the time of the increase were actually due to the law changes or something else. 
 
Luckily,  many  states  changes  the  school  laws  at  different  times,  allowing  controls  for  time  fixed 
effects and state fixed effects. 
 
Angrist and Acemoglu have used US variation  in state compulsory school  laws  to estimate  returns  to 
education ranging from about 7 to 10%. 
 
A number of recent papers have now branched off and used  these instruments  to examine outcomes 
other than earnings: 
 
Llearas Muney: mortality 
Lochner and Moretti: likelihood of ending up in jail. 
 
 
I  started my project wondering whether  I  could detect an effect of education on  subjective well-being 
(‘happiness’). 
 
No  luck  with  General  Social  Survey:  results  too  imprecise,  and  only  had  current  state  of  residence 
rather than residence of birth. 
 
I  heard  about  Harmon  and  Walker’s  paper  that  estimated  returns  to  education  off  of  a  compulsory 
school law change in Britain, and knew there were happiness data available with the British Data. 
 
Amazing first stage!

IV results also hold up, even for ‘happiness’ 
 
Table 2, 3, 4 
 
Specification checks hold up very well too: 
 
Tables A3 A4 A5 
 
 
Rather than turn the paper into a ‘returns to education on happiness’, it occurred to me that there was 
a more interesting point to all of these results. 
 
What  is  the  LATE  from  these  estimates?   Who  are  those  affected  by  compulsory  schooling?   We’re 
really looking at the returns to compulsory schooling. 
 
If  the  instrument  is  valid,  compulsory  schooling  identifies  the  effects  of  additional  schooling  for 
individuals that otherwise would not have continued on. 
 
Who are these people that prefer not to continue? 
 
Consider in the context of a human capital model: 
 
In  year  zero,  an  individual must  decide whether  to  dropout,  s=0,  or  not,  s  =  1.   Assuming  her  period 
consumption utility is logC, her lifetime utility, extending to year T and conditional on school choice is:

Compulsory  schooling  prevents  drop  out  behaviour.    In  the  context  of  our  human  capital  model 
above,  compulsory  schooling  compels  individuals  for  which  (*)  holds  to  go  from  S=0  to  S=1.    Since 
they are already optimizing, compulsory schooling should lower lifetime utlity.1  From a human capital 
perspective,  compulsory  schooling  is  a  very  strange  policy  to  advocate  and  enforce!    Very  little  has 
been  said  in  economics  about  this  policy  that  has  been  around  for  at  least  a  hundred  years.    I’ve 
come  across  only  2  papers  that  acknowledge  the  welfare  decreasing  implications  of  compulsory 
                                                 
1 In Chiswick’s (1969) words, ‘while those compelled to over-invest [in school] experience an increase in their 
annual post-investment income, they experience a decrease in their marginal and average internal rates of return’.

schooling  under  a human  capital model,  but  note  that  it may  still  reduce  earnings  inequality  (even  at 
the expense of  lowering welfare).  Another paper mentions this anomaly can occur in the presence of 
education externalities. 
 
Why were compulsory school laws introduced in the first place?  Why do people continue to advocate 
raising  the  school  leaving  age?    Motivations  behind  this  policy  often  relate  to  paternalistic 
assumptions  that children wishing  to  leave school early are,  in  fact, better off  from staying on, or  that 
positive externalities exist from raising a population’s overall education attainment. 
 
It  occurred  to  me  that  this  instrument  might  provide  an  interesting  way  to  test  the  human  capital

to prefer to dropout.

The  equation  is  very  similar,  but  the  individual’s marginal  cost  from  an  additional  year  of  school  now 
includes her disutility from less consumption instead of disutility from foregone earnings.

2) Uncertainty 
 
Heckman  suggests  the  reason why  returns  to  education  are  higher  than  the  interest  rate  is  because 
an  education  investment  is  risky.    Analogous  to  other  financial  investments,  risk  leads  to  a  higher 
return  demanded.    To  see  this  in  the  context  of  our  model,  suppose  the  time  preference  discount 
factor, δ, equals the financial discount factor,  R .  This assumption leads to the well-known result that 
a student attempts to smooth consumption over her lifetime.  Suppose also that the student is liquidity

future  earnings  to  convert  income-streams  into  present  value,  researchers  often  correct  for 
uncertainty with a discount rate higher than the risk-free rate.   
 
The appropriate financial discount rate to use is similar to that for treating education as an investment 
decision.    A  better  depiction  of  the  school-choice  model  involves  choosing  between  alternative 
earnings  distributions.    If  a  student  is  risk-neutral,  then  only  differences  in  expected  returns  matter 
and  a  risk-free  financial  discount  rate  to  convert  future  expected  returns  to  present  value  should  be

used.  If a student is risk-averse, higher expected returns from additional schooling may matter less if 
the variance in expected earnings is also higher. 
 
A  small  literature  that measures  riskiness  of education  involves  comparing  variances  of  log  earnings 
among  different  education  groups  for  students  with  similar  characteristics.    The  previous  literature 
focuses  on  whether  earnings  uncertainty  increases  when  extending  schooling  beyond  high  school 
(e.g.  Levhari  and  Weiss,  1974  and  Chen,  2002).    The  uncertainty  from  extending  a  student’s 
minimum  education  attainment  level  by  one  year,  however,  is  not  comparable  with  these  earlier 
estimates since additional high school is unlikely to contribute to human capital specialization. 
 
I  find  evidence  that  additional  high  school  is  less  risky  than  without.    I  also  find  dropouts  that  faced 
more  restrictive  school-leaving  ages  are  less  likely  to  be  unemployed.    Among  15  and  16  year  olds 
not  in  school  from  the  1950  U.S.  census,  less  then  half  recorded  are  in  the  labor  force  (41  percent) 
and 89 percent still live with parents.  Fifty years later, the pattern has not changed much.  Among 17 
year-olds not  in school in the 2000 U.S. Census, for example, 90.4 percent  lived with parents, and 45 
percent  were  not  in  the  labor  force.    The  results  support  a  preference  for  using  a  risk-free  financial 
discount  rate  to  make  present  value  comparisons.    For  sensitivity  analysis,  I  consider  a  range  of 
possible  rates:  3  percent,  5  percent,  and  8  percent.    All  three  assumptions  generate  similar 
conclusions.    But  there  doesn’t  seem  to  be  any  strong  reason  for  a  case  that  additional  high  school 
leads to high probability of lower wages. 
 
 
3) Hyperbollic Discounting: 
 
Students  value  the  future,  but  when  making  decisions,  they  value  the  present  temporarily  more.  
Following  Laibson  (1997)  and  O’Donoghue  and  Rabin  (1999),  one  way  to  incorporate  immediate 
impatience into the school choice model is to add a second discount rate placing more relative weight 
on the current period versus all other periods:

A  student discounts all  consequences  beyond  the  first  period  from  the  school  choice decision  by  the 
factor  β.  If 
1<β , this quasi-hyperbolic discount factor changes the discounting of this period relative 
to  the  entire  future.    If  students  could  make  school  choice  decisions  before  facing  any  imminent 
opportunity  cost,  they would  place  less weight  on  these  costs  than when  facing  them at  the  time  the 
decision  is actually made.   Preferences under such behavior are  time  inconsistent.   The condition  for 
dropping out is if:

The more  the  individual  discounts  the  future,  the  larger  the weight  placed on her  disutility  from effort 
at  school.    Furthermore,  a  hyperbolic  discount  rate  also  lowers  the  significance  placed  on  the  non-
pecuniary portion of education’s relative benefits.   
 
4) Identity, peer effects: 
 
Deviating  from  behavior  common  to  one’s  social  group  may  evoke  anxiety  and  discomfort  in  one’s 
self  and  in  others,  even  if  such  behavior,  without  considering  self-image,  would  raise  lifetime  utility.

A student whose social group considers dropping out acceptable (and even expected)  is more 

likely  to  drop  out  in  the  identity  model  for  two  reasons.    First,  deviating  from  her  social  group’s 

expectations  and  attitudes  would  likely  generate  an  immediate  disutility.    Second,  she may  perceive 

this disutility to continue in the future.     

If  the  discomfort  a  student  gets  from  exceeding  her  social  groups’  school  attainment  norm 

predominates her reason for dropping out, then raising the minimum school leaving age may increase 

her lifetime utility.  She no longer would receive discomfort from her decision, since her social group’s 

school  attainment  norm would  also  adjust  from  the  law  change.   Her  peers would  also  face  the  new 

dropout  age.    Increasing  the  school  leaving  age  would  also  prevent  her  from  projecting  her  current 

state  over  her  future.    A  student  that  would  choose  to  continue  schooling,  where  it  not  for  concerns 

over how doing so affects her self-image, would be better off under a higher minimum school  leaving 

age policy.

Students may systematically mispredict expected gains  from additional education.   Students may not 
make  correct  present  value  calculations  of  future  returns,  or  may  underestimate  the  real  gains  from 
school.    Dominitz  and  Manski  (2000)  find  substantial  variation  among  high  school  students  in

earnings expectations conditional on a bachelor degree.  While expectations about the returns from a 
degree were positive,  it  seems questionable whether would-be-dropouts  can anticipate  lifetime gains 
from  one  more  year  of  school.    The  annual  gains  may  seem  insignificantly  small  and  ignored  when 
comparing  them  to  a  large  initial  burden  from  staying  in  school  (Rubinstein,  1988).    Guidance  from 
parents who themselves dropped out or peers that do not care for school may also  lead to misguided 
expectations of returns to school.
