1 Goal of this lecture

• Review basic Becker story
• Consider stylized model of general skills training in a competitive labor market.
• Add various labor market perfections to the model to consider how they alter ﬁrms’
training decisions:

— Search costs and other wedges

— Search costs that diﬀer by worker skill level

— Exogenous turnover

— Nash bargaining

— Minimum wages
— Asymmetric information→Adverse selection
• Goal is to understand who pays for general skills training, and what are the eﬃciency
consequences. As it turns out, market structure and training provision are tightly linked,

an insight originally due to Becker. Deviating from either the perfectly competitive or

pure monopsony cases studied by Becker gives rise to interesting and general insights

about wage structure, market institutions, private information, and training provision.

• An interesting feature of the modern literature is its implicit focus on the limitations
of contracting. Becker considered one speciﬁc contracting problem — holdup of ﬁrm by

workers. It turns out, this problem is richer than Becker may have seen at that time.

1.1 Basic model

Deﬁnition 1 Generals skil ls — Skil ls useful to many employers (“many buyers”).

Deﬁnition 2 Speciﬁc skil ls — Skil ls with exactly one buyer.

• Timeline

2

1. t = 1. Training and production (human capital investments sunk). Workers produce

output y and receive training τ at cost c(τ ).

2. t = 1.5. Workers face option to leave ﬁrm.

3. t = 2. Production takes place again. Worker produces output y + f (τ ) at any ﬁrm

(general training).

• Assume: f 0(τ ) > 0, c(0) = c0 (0) = 0 and c0 (τ ) > 0, c00 (τ ) > 0, c0(τ )
τ →∞ → ∞.

1.2 Basic Becker insight: Holdup

• FOC social optimum for training? c0 (τ ∗ ) = f 0 (τ ∗ ).
• How do we know that τ ∗ > 0?
• Can ﬁrm pay worker w1 = y , w2 = y + f (τ ) − c(τ )?
• Basic insight of Becker model: In a competitive labor market, employers will not pay
for general human capital. The problem is “holdup.” Since the worker’s opportunity

(outside) wage rises by f (τ ) with training, ﬁrm must pay w2 = y + f (τ ) or lose employee
to a competitor.

• Q: Since employers unwilling to fund socially productive training, is this a market fail-
ure? A: Worker is full residual claimant to returns from training investments ⇒ Eﬃcient
incentive for worker to make the investments.

• Two canonical solutions to this problem:
1. Direct investments by workers — School, training programs, etc.

2. Indirect payment to employer: Training wage. Hence:
w1 = y − c(τ ∗ ), w2 = y + f (τ ∗ ).
• Just to check intuition:

3

— How do high rates of labor turnover aﬀect training investment incentives? Not at

all.

— How do worker credit constraints impact this model? Quite a bit.

∗ Cannot typically borrow against future stock of human capital (except from
government, e.g., student loans).
∗ Wages may not go low enough (e.g., negative) to cover eﬃcient training expen-
ditures.

• How relevant is this model?
— Clearly, covers considerable territory: College education is paid for by families, soci-

ety; Professional schools do not generally subsidize tuition: Law, medicine, business.

— What about the case of military education? Military ﬂight education costs multiple

millions to provide. The skills are completely portable (to commercial aviation).

1.3 Is that all there is to it?

• A persistent suspicion that there is more going on — employers are paying for general skills
training.

— German apprenticeships: Acemoglu and Pischke QJE (1998) Table 1.

— BLS 1994 study of employer training. Found that employers spent $3.4 billion in

1994 on direct tuition reimbursements and outside training funds (almost certainly

general). Was all of this paid for by workers?

— Example of Temporary Help Supply (THS) ﬁrms. Demonstrably clear that THS

ﬁrms do pay up-front costs of training (about $150 per trainee) prior to job assign-

ment, without any contractual obligation to perform work.

• These examples have spurred continued interest in the provision and payment of general
skills training.

4

• There are 2 seminal papers that give rise to discussion of modern theories of training.
One is Grout (1984) Econometrica, the second is Greenwald (1986), Review of Economic

Studies. I’ll touch on results from both of these papers later on.

• Continue with the setup from above with.
— f (τ ) is productivity with f 0 (τ ) > 0 and f 00 (τ ) < 0, and c(τ ) is as above.

— Denote ν (τ ) as the outside wage paid to a person with training τ .

— Assume for now that for whatever reasons, workers do not obtain outside training.

Hence τ = 0 < τ ∗ initially.

1.3.1 Case 1: Constant wedge

• See Figure 1.
• Take a case initially where f 0 (τ ) = ν 0(τ ) and f 00 (τ ) = ν 00 (τ ).
• Consider ﬁrm’s maximization problem:

π(τ ) = f (τ ) − ν (τ ) − c(τ )
max
τ
Q: What does perfectly competitive market about relationship between f (τ ) and ν (τ )?

(1)

Q: Why ν (τ ) not f (τ ) in the ﬁrm’s maximization?

• FOC for (1) is

c0 (τ ) = f 0(τ ) − ν 0 (τ )
which is satisﬁed at τ ∗ = 0. This echoes the Becker model.

(2)

• Now instead assume that f (τ ) − ν (τ ) = ∆(τ ) = ∆ > 0. Can think of ∆ as a search
friction. How does this search aﬀect τ ∗ in (2)? Why?

1.3.2 Case 2: Increasing wedge

• See Figure 2.

5

• Now consider a new search friction whereby
f (τ ) > ν (τ ) and f 0 (τ ) > ν 0(τ ).

Continue to assume concavity of f (·) and ν (·) .
• Assume for now:
— No exogenous turnover. All workers remain with the ﬁrm in period 2 if receive v(τ ).

— All bargaining power rests with the ﬁrm — that is, ﬁrm is the full residual claimant
of any surplus (f (τ ) − ν (τ ) − c(τ )).
• First order condition is the same as (2) , f 0 (τ ) − ν 0(τ ) = c(τ ), but now there will be an
interior solution at τ ∗ > 0. This follows because ∆(τ ) > 0 and ∆0(τ ) > 0 (and recall that
c0(·), c00 (·) > 0).
• So notice that this search friction raises training, whereas the other does not. How does
the assumption that f 0 (τ ) > ν 0 (τ ) change the holdup problem?

• Q: Is this solution socially eﬃcient? A: No, ineﬃciently low.
• Social maximization is f 0 (τ ) = c(τ ), whereas ﬁrm only maximizes (f 0 (τ ) − ν 0 (τ )) = c(τ ).
In other words, ﬁrm maximizes ‘the wedge,’ not output net of costs.

• So, ﬁrm would only choose the social optimum if ν 0(τ ) = 0, i.e., wage invariant to training
level.

• This is something of a paradox: More ‘ineﬃcient’ market structure — greater wedge be-
tween productivity and wages — encourages greater ﬁrm training. (Echoes Becker result on

labor market monopsony, or ﬁrm speciﬁc capital also has the feature that ν 0 (τ specif ic ) = 0.)

• Let’s look at two other wrinkles on this result: Nash bargaining and exogenous post-
training turnover.

6

Nash bargaining and turnover

• Nash bargaining: A fraction of the surplus β ∈ [0, 1] goes to the worker.
• Nash bargaining corresponds to the absence of contracts. The assumption is that ex
ante wage agreements are not feasible, so ﬁrms and workers bargain over the surplus ex

post. Each demands at least its threat point: for workers, that’s ν (τ ), for ﬁrms, that’s

also ν (τ ), since they could hire identical workers to produce f (τ ) at wage ν (τ ) if these

workers quit.

(3)

• So the maximization is now
c0(τ β ) = (1 − β ) £f 0 (τ β ) − ν 0(τ β )¤ ,
with the worker’s wage set by
w(τ β ) = ν (τ β ) + β £f (τ β ) − ν (τ β )¤ ,
π(τ β ) = (1 − β ) £f (τ β ) − ν (τ β )¤ − c ¡τ β ¢
• Now, some important questions raised by the Grout article:
1. Why doesn’t c(τ ) enter (3) in parallel to f (τ ) or ν (τ )?

and proﬁts

• Answer: Because c(τ ) is sunk. And this bargain is set ex post.
• That is, wages are determined by worker’s outside opportunity ν (τ ) and her claim
β on ﬁrm’s quasi-rents, which are f 0 (τ β ) − ν 0 (τ β ).
• Q: Why is f 0(τ β ) − ν 0(τ β ) a quasi rent?
2. Are workers necessarily better oﬀ with β large?

• Notice that with τ constant, it is clearly the case that

ν (τ ) + β [f (τ ) − ν (τ )] > ν (τ ).

7

• But τ is not constant. As Grout’s article demonstrates (not for this case), since
since τ β that satisﬁes c0 ¡τ β ¢ = (1 − β ) £f 0(τ β ) − ν 0(τ β )¤is strictly less than τ 0 that
satisﬁes c0 (τ 0 ) = [f 0 (τ 0 ) − ν 0(τ 0 )] .This follows because in the β > 0 case, workers
are expropriating part of the ﬁrm’s quasi-rents from the sunk training investment.

Anticipating this fact, the ﬁrm invests less in training.

• Note that this result also depends upon the convexity of the training cost function.
By reducing scale of training, ﬁrm increases marginal returns.

• As β rises, workers get a larger share of a smaller pie. In the extreme case where
β = 1, we have τ β = 0, no training occurs.

• This brings up a key point from Grout’s article (Theorem 3.2):
∂π(·)
∂w
∂β
∂β

−
that is, the fall in proﬁts for an increase in worker bargaining power is strictly less

>

,

than the gain in worker wages — so the bargaining solution reduces social eﬃciency.

• How do we know this to be true? The change in proﬁts for an increment to β is:
= −f (τ β ) + ν (τ β ) + £(1 − β ) (f 0 (τ β ) − ν 0 (τ β )) − c0 ¡τ β ¢¤ ∂ τ β /∂β ,
∂π(τ β )
∂β
whereas the increase in wages is
= f (τ β ) − ν (τ β ) + β £f 0(τ β ) − ν 0 (τ β )¤ ∂ τ β /∂β .
∂w(τ β )
∂β
Putting these two together, the total social gain/loss is
= £f 0 (τ β ) − ν 0 (τ β ) − c0 ¡τ β ¢¤ ∂ τ β /∂β < 0,
∂w(τ β )
∂β
since ∂ τ β /∂β < 0 and f 0(τ β ) − ν 0 (τ β ) − c0 ¡τ β ¢ > 0 as long as tβ is below the social
optimum, which will always be true here. Notice that the social loss here is exactly
the contraction in the pie caused by the reduction in training ∂ τ β /∂β (the rest is a

∂π(τ β )
∂β

+

transfer from ﬁrm to worker).

8

• So, as soon as we deviate into a case where contracts are not enforceable and costs
are sunk, the 2nd welfare theorem no longer holds — there is a direct conﬂict between

eﬃciency and distribution. This is a primary insight from Grout’s article.

• Also brieﬂy consider the case of exogenous worker turnover at rate q . From the ﬁrm’s
perspective, this works exactly like an increase in bargaining power. The FOC is

c0(τ q ) = (1 − q) [f 0(τ q ) − ν 0(τ q )] .
Training again drops with a rise in q . The reason is that there are fewer trainees around

in the 2nd period from whom the ﬁrm can capture the returns from training.

1.3.3 Summary so far

The discussion of training in the “increasing wedge” case gives rise to three perverse comparative

statics. Training is increasing in:

1. The degree of distortion in the wage structure. The greater is ∆0(τ ), the more ﬁrms train.

2. The more bargaining power that rests with the ﬁrm. The smaller is β (worker’s bargaining

power), the more ﬁrm trains.

3. The lower is worker mobility. Less turnover q ↓, more training.
Hence, anything that increases ﬁrm’s marginal share of returns to training also increases

training in this setup. Yet, you should not think this is a complete accounting; a higher training

economy is not necessarily globally more eﬃcient:

• Training is closer to optimal
• But labor supply is sub-optimal due to ineﬃcient wage incentives (workers paid below
marginal product).

• The limited monopsony present when turnover is low may dampen eﬃcient reallocation
of workers to jobs (speaking loosely).

9

1.4 Structure of wages and investment in general training

• It is a commonplace belief that worker turnover is inimical to employer training. And
indeed, industries with low turnover also have high training.

• Is it the simple duration of the attachment between workers and ﬁrms that gives rise to
this pattern?

• Consider the constant wedge case, where ∆(τ ) > 0 and ∆0 (τ ) = 0. The ﬁrm’s FOC, as
above, is

which is satisﬁed at tq = 0.

c0(τ q ) = (1 − q) [f 0(τ q ) − ν 0(τ q )] ,

• Hence, the commonplace assertion that “labor market frictions” are suﬃcient for ﬁrm
investment in training is incorrect. A “frictional” labor market is not necessarily a high

training labor market.

• Frictions must be of a specialized kind: The compression of the wage structure — that is,
the gap between wages and marginal products — must be greater for more skilled/trained

workers.

• If f (τ ) − ν (τ ) = ∆, then there is no ﬁrm-sponsored training, even with zero exogenous
turnover and no worker bargaining power (q = 0, β = 0).

• This is a key insight because it directs your gaze towards features of the labor market
that might give rise to a situation where f (τ ) − ν (τ ) is increasing in τ , that is ∆0 (τ ) > 0.
This point is made in full generality by the Acemoglu-Pischke (1999) JPE paper.

• Now, we want to consider a two possible reasons why the wage structure might be com-
pressed as needed to generate incentives for ﬁrm investment in general skills: 1) Minimum

wages; 2) Adverse selection.

10

1.4.1 Minimum wages and investment in general training

• It is a standard view that minimum wages will reduce training. Why? Function like a
credit constraint — reduce workers’ ability to take a pay cut to pay for general training.

• This result has been “veriﬁed” in papers by Blackburn and Neumark among others — but
this work does not exploit within-state variation in minimum wages, so it’s hard to have

great conﬁdence in these papers.

• Consider a case as depicted in Figure 3. Here ∆0(τ ) = 0 by assumption, so normally
not an incentive for ﬁrm investment in worker training (however, we still assume that

∆(τ ) > 0 , which is not standard).

• Imposition of a binding minimum wage compresses wage distribution below the minimum,
but leaves it unaﬀected above. If the following things are true:

— Firms don’t shut down

— Positive proﬁts are still made on these workers
— c(τ min) < [f (τ min ) − ν (τ min)] − (τ min) < [f (0) − wmin )]
...ﬁrms will want to increase training.

• A table from the Acemoglu-Pischke (1999) paper on minimum wages and general training
provides some evidence that this might be going on.

• At a minimum, their paper does not support the contention that the impact of binding
minimum wage on training provision is negative.

1.4.2 Adverse selection, monopsony, and training

• Greenwald’s seminal 1986 ReStud paper oﬀered the general observation that if workers
are heterogeneous and potential employers cannot observe this heterogeneity perfectly,

incumbent employers are likely to have an informational advantage over their employees

relative to outside employers. This informational advantage can give rise to adverse

selection.

11

• This insight is directly analogous to the Akerlof 1970 “Market for Lemons” paper applied
to the labor market — where it could easily be more relevant. (Q: Unlike used cars, workers

can tell you about their ‘quality.’ Why doesn’t this solve the problem?)

• Let’s embellish the current model to incorporate the case of worker heterogeneity and see
how it gives rise to adverse selection. Assumptions:

1. Two types of workers: η ∈ {H, L} . Pr(η = H ) = ρ.
2. Type H produces f (τ ) , type L produces 0 (a normalization).

3. Ability η is unknown to employers at time of hire. ρ and f (τ ) are common knowl-

edge.

4. Ability for each employee is observed by incumbent employer in 1st period

5. There is exogenous turnover after end of 1st turnover. A fraction q of all workers

turns over immediately after training.

6. In addition, there is endogenous turnover if w < ν (τ ) .

• Time line is as above:
1. t = 0 : Training and production

2. t = 1.5 : Turnover

3. t = 2: Production

• What are equilibrium wages and training in this model? Solve by backward induction.
— Consider wages in 2nd period assuming that τ ∗ > 0.

— The expected productivity of trained type H workers is f (τ ∗ )

— The expected productivity of trained type L workers is 0.

• How are wages set in the outside labor market? Our outside wage concept is ν (τ ∗ ). This
is the opportunity wage for a trained worker (remember, we are assuming all workers are

trained).

12

• Since outside ﬁrms cannot distinguish H from L workers, it must be the case that ν (τ ∗ )
is independent of η . So ν (τ ∗) must equal the expected productivity of workers available
for hire at wage ν (τ ∗ ). (This is the Perfect Bayesian equilibrium concept that is normally
applied to models with information uncertainty).

• It’s easiest to think about the expected productivity of workers who have turned over,
since they are in the market (but we can generalize to the case of ‘raids’ on ﬁrms).

Expected productivity of departed workers is

(#H separators)
E (f (·) |separate) =
#H separators + #L separators · f (τ ∗)
• What is the composition of the outside pool:
— Exogenous turnover q of H workers → qρ
— Exogenous turnover q of L workers → q(1 − ρ)
— All type L workers who don’t turn over by themselves will be oﬀered a wage of 0 by

their incumbent employer after the 1st period (this is the informational advantage).
This fraction is (1 − q)(1 − ρ). These group of endogenous separators will ‘pool’ with
the exogenous separators. Hence, productivity of outside pool is
qρ
qρ + (1 − ρ) · f (τ ∗ )
• Consequently, the incumbent employer need only pay ν (τ ∗ ) to retain its type H workers.
Incumbent employer beneﬁts from “ex post monopsony” stemming from private informa-

ν (τ ∗ ) =

(4)

tion.

Why? Because this is the wage that they would command if they quit the ﬁrm (in equi-

librium, they do not, of course). Moreover, if an outside ﬁrm tried to bid them away, the

incumbent employer could simply match wage oﬀers up to f (τ ∗ ) for its H workers while
not matching this wage for its L workers. Hence, the outside ﬁrm would always overpay

for workers it poached (‘winner’s curse’).

• Now, return to ﬁrm’s maximization for training in 1st period,
π = (1 − q) ρ [f (τ ) − ν (τ )] − c (τ ) ,
max
τ
13

with FOC

c0 (τ ∗ ) = (1 − q) ρ [f 0 (τ ∗ ) − ν 0 (τ ∗ )] .
Since ν 0 (τ ) < f 0 (τ ) , this maximization will have a solution with τ ∗ > 0.

• In this example, adverse selection compresses the wage structure. Why does this work?
Due to private information, the expected productivity of the pool of separators is below

the expected productivity of the randomly drawn hire during the 1st period. That’s

because good workers predominately stay with their own ﬁrm, while the bad ones turnover

after their low productivity is discovered by incumbent employer. Although good workers

would like to earn f (τ ∗ ) , their actual productivity, rather than ν (τ ) , the opportunity
wage, they would be cursed by adverse selection if they turned over. Hence, incumbent

employer has limited monopsony power.

• Q: The model has a hidden assumption — unrelated to the information structure of the
model — that made this result work. What is it? There is a complementarity between
training and ability; speciﬁcally, ∂ 2f (·) /∂ τ ∂ η > 0: H workers get ∂ f (·) /∂ τ > 0 from
training, whereas L workers get ∂ f (·) /∂ τ = 0.
• Consider instead if we had assumed that f (τ ) = η + γ (τ ) . Then equation (4) becomes
qρ
(5)
qρ + (1 − ρ)
and so f 0 (τ ) − ν (τ ) = 0, and no general training is provided.
• So, this assumed complementarity between training and ability (positive cross-partial
derivative) was necessary to generate the “increasing wedge” that makes it proﬁtable for

+ f (τ ),

ν (τ ) =

ﬁrms to fund general training. Whether this assumption is reasonable — in addition to

being necessary — is a question that the model cannot answer.

• In fact, there is considerable evidence that better educated and better paid workers — in
addition to more “able” workers within education cells — receive more training. Is this

evidence convincing for existence of complementarity? If you believed in complementarity,

how would you explain the fact that Instrumental Variables (IV) returns to education are

14

higher than OLS returns? IV returns, after all, are identiﬁed from behavior of less-

educated workers.

1.4.3 Testing the adverse selection model

• For many economists, the adverse selection model has something of the ring of truth. That
is, incumbent employers do have better information about their own employees than do

other potential employers — this is hard to dispute. And this informational advantage

might make it rational to invest in their general skills if it gave rose to some type of

wedge between productivity and outside wages.

• Problem: A model that is inherently about unobservable information is diﬃcult to test
using standard data sources.

• One idea: Look for exogenous shocks to employment that break adverse selection equilib-
rium.

1. Gibbons and Katz (1991) Journal of Labor Economics (not about training). Layoﬀs

versus plant closings. It follows very generally from the adverse selection argument

that workers who separate from a ﬁrm endogenously (layoﬀs) should be worse than

workers who separate due to exogenous shocks (plant closings — not necessarily ex-

ogenous, but aﬀect bad and good workers in the plant simultaneously).

Hence, G&K compare these two groups, show that in fact the laid oﬀ workers do

considerably worse (esp. for white collar workers). This is particularly striking be-

cause you might assume that workers losing jobs in plant closing would fare worse

due to concentrated job loss in one geographic area.

2. Acemoglu and Pischke (1999, QJE ). They view “military quitters” as a group like

those who experience plant closings. Exogenously separate, not cursed by adverse

selection. So, even though military quitters are lower in ability than average workers,

their post-military wages are higher. This is interesting, though perhaps not a strong

est.

• Another idea: Study a labor market where...
15

— Lots of general training given.

— Essentially no ﬁrm-speciﬁc capital (since workers sent to multiple client sites), so

training most likely “general.”

— High turnover. (An outlier in the industry plot of training versus turnover.)

— Training provided up-front during unpaid, non-production hours and is not con-

tracted. Hence, there is no opportunity for ﬁrms to pay a training wage that is

below marginal product.

— Heterogeneity of policies — not all ﬁrms train (but the ‘high quality’ ones do).

• Autor, 2001 QJE attempts to understand why this training is proﬁtable for THS ﬁrms.
Motivations for training (interviews):

1. ‘Recruitment’ — Attract skilled/motivated workers

2. Testing — Training is a skill screen

3. Skills development — Human capital acquisition, particularly in oﬃce software

• Insight of this model is that if training and ability are indeed complements, oﬀering
training should induce positive self-selection on unobserved ability — that is, high ability

workers value training more than low ability workers since it is complementary with

ability. (See Salop and Salop 1976 QJE for a similar structure applied to a diﬀerent

beneﬁt.)

• Setup of model. Building on previous information model, but now giving workers some
ex ante knowledge of own ability (necessary for self-selection to be relevant):

1. Workers have some private information about own ability.

— η = {H, L} = {1, 0} . Pr(η = H ) = ρ.
— Workers have beliefs about their own ability ex ante: b = {H, L}
— Pr(η = H |b = h) = δh > ρ. Pr(η = H |b = l) = δ l < (1 − ρ). So 1 > δh > ρ >
δ l > 0. Beliefs are informative but not infallible.

16

2. Firms learn about ability by training. That is, training incorporates testing, but it

is not only testing.

3. Ability and training are publicly observed in 3rd period. So, period of monopsony is

brief.

4. Production f (τ ) = η (1 + τ ). Training and ability are complements.

• Time line of this model:
— t = 1 : Workers select a ﬁrm (training versus non-training) and receive any training

oﬀered.

— t = 1.5: Exogenous + endogenous turnover

— t = 2 : Deployed by THS ﬁrm to client site

— t = 3: Hired into non-THS sector (monopsony ends)

• To ﬁnd equilibrium, backward induction. Start at 3rd period. Assume we are at separating
equilibrium. H workers go to training ﬁrms, L workers do not.

• Third period:

w3 = η(1 + τ ).

Since ability and training are publicly observed in 3rd period, workers are paid their

marginal product, which depends on η and where they worked in 1st period and hence

how much training they received.

• Second period:

w2 = ½ ν (0) = δ l
if b = h ¾ .
if b = l
ν (τ ) = qδh (1+τ ∗ )
qδh+(1−δh )
Notice that there is no adverse selection for low ability workers (who go to non-training
ﬁrms); since non-training ﬁrms don’t train, don’t get private information. So, wage of

workers at non-training ﬁrms is simply the share who are in expectation high ability,

which is δ l .
By contrast, wage of trainees ν (τ ) is set by adverse selection due to private information.

17

• Comparison of ν (0) ≶ ν (τ ) : Could easily be the case that ν (0) > ν (τ ) , even though
ability, productivity higher at training ﬁrms (since high ability share is δh > δ l ). Why?
Consider comparison with “military quitters.”

• Now, we can get separating condition for low ability to choose non-training ﬁrms, high
ability to choose training ﬁrms. Expected earnings are:
ω3
ω2
ω1

No train
Train
• For high ability, expected earnings are:
ω1

0
0

ν (0)
ν (τ ∗ )

δ l
δ l (1 + τ ∗ )

ω2

ω3

No train
ν (0)
δh
0
Train
ν (τ ∗ )
δh(1 + τ ∗ )
0
• So, the separating condition under which high ability workers choose training ﬁrms and
low ability workers choose non-training ﬁrms is simply,

δ l τ ∗ < ν (0) − ν (τ ∗ ) < δhτ ∗ .
The expected gain to training for high ability workers exceeds short term wage costs in

period 2, and vice versa for low ability workers.

• Testable empirical implication: Wages lower (post-training) at training establishments,
despite up-front training. This is particularly surprising since wages of trainees should be

higher ex post in Becker setup — and this is almost universally found in literature. This

would be true in general even if workers were paying for training if ability and training

are complements. (See tables from QJE 2001)

• So, in this model, training is not solely a human capital formation mechanism. It also
elicits otherwise unobservable information about worker (beliefs about) ability, which

ﬁrms can use proﬁtably (for a short period) while they hold information privately.

• (A contribution of this paper: May help to understand the role that THS industry plays
as an information broker in labor market, rather than as simply a provider of spot market

labor services.)

18

1.5 Conclusions

• View of general training has come some ways since Becker, though its fair to say that
these models are standing on Becker’s shoulders rather than standing Becker on his head.

• View of training has to some extent caught up with what economists probably once
believed but did not have tools to express: private information, poor contracting, distorts

costs and beneﬁts of training. It is neither wholly paid for by workers nor necessarily

eﬃciently provided by ﬁrms.

• Does this literature have a future? It’s possible to argue that training has been over-
studied by labor economists. It’s no longer interesting to ask what are the ‘returns to

training.’ However, it is interesting to ask about how market structure aﬀects training

provision (the question implicitly raised by the A&P models on wage compression and

training provision).

• Interesting example: training provision and AIDS in Africa. How would you expect AIDS
to aﬀect training investment? Overall? By age group? By geography?
