Lecture 9 
Imperfect Markets 
 
Today we consider wage determination  that depends on more  than  just expected productivity.  
We  develop  a  model  that  shows  how  individuals  with  the  same  productivity  and  the  same 
tastes can end up earning different wages at different firms in a monopsony setting. 
 
Basic Monopsony Model 
 
In  a  perfectly  competitive  labour  market,  the  labour  supply  curve  for  an  individual  firm  is 
perfectly  inelastic,  meaning  the  labour  supply  curve  is  horizontal.    Firms must  take  wages  as 
given.    There  is  no  need  to  raise  the wage,  because  they  can  hire  any  number  of workers  at 
the going wage, and if they lower the wage (by even a penny) all workers will want to leave.  In 
equilibrium,  firms  the  going wage  is  driven up  to  the marginal product of  the worker.   Thus,  in 
equilibrium,  workers  in  a  perfectly  competitive  market  are  paid  their  marginal  product:  what 
they contribute to the profit of a firm.

Profit of a  firm  is:

input),  and w  is  the wage  rate.    The  first  order  condition  is:

A  monopsonist  firm  does  not  take  the  wage  the  wage  as  given.    A  monopsonist  not  only 
chooses  how  much  labour  to  hire,  but  what  wage  to  pay.    However,  the  monopsonist  is 
constrained  by  the  labour  supply  to  the  firm.    It’s  just  that  this  labour  supply  is  no  longer 
s =
perfectly  inelastic.  A firm’s labour supply  is: 
, a function of the wage.  This is not the

same  as  the  individual’s overall  labour  supply.    If a  firm  raises  it’s wage,  relative  to  the  rest of

the  market,  more  workers  will  want  to  work  there: 
  (labour  supply  is  no  longer

perfectly elastic).

how much labour to hire, the monopsonist takes into account, that when he increases one unit

most  important  insight  from  the monopsony model  for our purposes  is  that profit will no  longer 
be  zero.    The  marginal  product  from  a  worker  will  be  greater  than  the  wage  paid:

The classic example of Monopsony is where there exists a large firm that dominates hiring in a 
region  (such as a mining company  in a small  town), or an organization  that regulates all hiring 
(such  as  the  nurses  association,  or  the  NCAA).    But  a  more  general  interpretation  of 
monopsony  occurs  for  ANY  firm  that  faces  an  upward  sloping  labour  supply  curve.    We  will 
see  below  a model where  there  are many  firms,  but  all  face  an  upward  sloping  supply  curve.  
This  leads  to  a  labour  market  that  works  strikingly  different  from  the  perfectly  competitive 
situation.  
 
Manning’s Model of Monopsony 
 
Set-up: 
 
The basic set-up follows Manning’s Chapter 2 model of monopsony, which follows Burdett and 
Mortensen,  “Wage  differentials,  Employer  Size,  and  Unemployment,”  International  Economic 
Review, 1998.

Employers.  
 
There  are

Wage Determination 
 
Employers  set  wages  once  to  maximize  steady-state  profits.    All  workers  in  the  firm  are  paid 
the  same  wage.    The  cumulative  distribution  function  of  wages  across  employers  is

eλ.  I like this feature, because some other models require search to only take 
place  while  unemployed.    Clearly  that  is  less  realistic  than  this  case  here.    It  simplifies  the 
model a lot if we assume both employed and non-employed obtain job offers at the same rate, 
λ.   Burdett  and Mortensen  consider  the  case when  these  rates  are  different.1    Job offers are 
drawn at random from the set of firms (from the distribution 
).  Workers leave for reasons 
(wF

unrelated  to getting a higher paying  job at  rate

At  least  some  workers  are  willing  to  work  for  less  than  their  marginal  product  if  the  only 
alternative is unemployment.  This occurs when there exists some wage where w<p (the wage 
paid  is  less  than productivity) and w>b  (there are  some people  in  this world where  for a given 
wage lower than productivity, they value leisure less than that wage). 
 
Note,  the  assumption’s  we’ve  made  so  far  may  seem  restrictive,  but  are  relaxed  in  later 
chapters  of  Manning’s  book:  workers  have  identical  productivity,  no  mobility  costs,  workers 
care only about  the wage,  firms are  identical, constant returns, wages set once-and-for-all,  job 
offers drawn at random. 
 
The main  difference  between  this model and one of perfect  competition  is  that a worker does 
∞→λ ,  this  model 
not  receive  job  offers  by  every  firm  at  once.    In  this  special  case  when 
collapses to the perfect competition model, as we will see.  
 
Behavior or workers: 
 
A  worker  accepts  another  job  if  the  wage  offer  is  above  her  current  wage.    An  unemployed 
worker accepts a job if the wage offer is above her reservation wage, r.  Since job offers arrive 
at  the  same  rate  whether  employed  or  non-employed,  the  decision  to  accept  a  current  offer 
has  no  consequences  for  future  job  opportunities.    The  reservation  wage  thus  does  not 
depend  on 
,  but  is  only  equal  to  b,  the  value  of  leisure.    As  long  as  the  wage  offer  is 
(wF
)
higher than this amount, the worker accepts the offer.2

, which is found in most estimates, then the reservation wage will be below b as taking any job improves future 
e
employment prospects which means that a worker may want a job even if it makes them worse-off in the short-term.

The employers decision 
 
this  model  is  to  choose  a  wage  to  maximize  profits:

a wage w when  the  firm distribution of wages as a whole  is F.   An employer who pays a wage 
w will recruit workers from the nonemployed (as long as w greater than b), and from workers in 
other  firms  which  pay  less  than  w.    The  employer  will  lose  workers  who  exit  to  non-
employment or leave the labour force or who quit to other firms which pay higher wages.  In

Proof  by  contradiction: Suppose  a mass  of  firms  try  to  offer  the  same wage, w.   Consider  the 
perfectly competitive situation where w = p, then all these firms must be making zero profits.  If 
there  is  some  ‘stickiness’  in  the  speed  at  which  workers  can  find  jobs  paying  higher  wages 
(separation  rate  is  finite and recruitment rate  is positive), a  firm  that  lowers  its wage can make 
profit.  Its quit rate will now be higher and recruitment rate  lower, but the recruitment rate is not 
zero and its quit rate not infinite so it will still have some workers in steady-state.  For example, 
an  unemployed  worker  gets  a  wage  offer  from  this  firm  that  is  above  their  reservation  wage, 
and  decides  to  accept  the  offer,  since  she  can  always  look  for  a  better  job  while  she  is 
working. 
 
Now suppose a mass of firms try to offer the same wage, w, where w < p.  If a firm deviates by 
paying  an  infinitesimally  higher wage  (w+e),  profit  per worker  is only  inifitesimally  reduced but 
0>λ )  as  recruits 
the  all  workers  from  the  other  firms  want  to  work  for  that  firm,  (as  long  as 
now  come  from  workers  in  all  the  firms  who  continue  to  pay w.   Hence,  profits must  rise  and 
the initial situation could not have been an equilibrium. 
 
This  means  firms  will  offer  different  wages  over  a  distribution  between  b  and  p  to  identical 
workers.    This  is  a  striking  feature  of  the  Burdett  and  Mortensen  model.    We  are  left  still  to

∆λ  is the expected number of job offers for a single individual over period  ∆ .  A single offer is

distributed  randomly  across  all  individuals,  so  the  probability  of  receiving  that  offer  is 
wM/1
wMQ /∆=∆λ
Let  Q∆   be  the  total  number  of  offers  per  period.   
.    If  we  normalize  the  total 
number  of  offers  per  period  to  1,  then  we  can  interpret  λ  as  the  probability  an  individual 
receives an offer.  Burdett and Moretensen do this, but it may not be intuitive to think about the 
model this way with only ‘one’ firm offer per period.   
 
The  analysis  is  the  same  regardless  of  the  value  for  λ  if  we  consider  continuous  time,  as 
∞→∆
.    λ and  δ may  take on any  finite value (includes  those greater than 1).  The values of 
these parameters determine  the highest steady state wage.   These values are offer  rates and 
exogenous exit rates.  The interpretation is analogous to interest rates in continuous time.

The  wage  distribution  does  not  look  like  anything  we  see  in  the  data.    Evidence  of  the  wage 
distribution  for  the  average  worker  (across  firms)  seems  follow  more  of  a  log-normal 
distribution.    The  model  presented  here,  however,  is  highly  stylized  model.    Allowing  for 
heterogeneous  productivity  for  firms  help  generate  wage  distributions  that  follow  more  of  a 
hump shape (see, for an introduction to this, Mortensen, cited below). 
 
Now, take a step back to realize what we’ve done.  We’ve constructed a model where workers 
with the same productivity and tastes are paid different wages.  Why?  We’ve assumed market 
friction: Workers must search employers  for a  job, and don’t get offers from everyone at once.  
This causes workers  to stay at a  firm while searching  for a  job  that pays a higher wage.   Each 
employer  chooses a wage given  this search behaviour of workers.   The  labour  force available 
to  an  employer  is  constantly  changing.    There  is  a  nice  balancing  act,  because  there  is  a 
tradeoff  between  offering  a  higher  wage  and  having  a  more  stable  labour  force  (fewer  quits) 
and lower profit.   
 

λ
Note,  as  the  relative  rate  of  new  offers,  δ
,  becomes  infinite,  we  arrive  back  at  the 
perfectly  competitive  situation.    Thus,  the  assumption  that  not  all  firms  offer  jobs  to  a 
single  worker  at  once  leads  to  monopsony  power,  and  the  general  result  that  wages 
differ even though everyone is equally productive. 
 
λ
  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  the  market-friction  parameter.    It  determines  the  steady  state 
δ
unemployment  rate,  and  helps  determine  both  the  location  and  spread  of  the  wage 
distributions. 
 
“It  is  important  to  correct  the  impression  that  those  who  believe  that  employers  have  some 
market  power  over  workers  are  extremists  –  the  reality  is  that  those  who  believe  in  perfect 
competition  are  the  fanatics  as  perfect  competition  is  one  point  at  the  edge  of  the  parameter 
space  and  every  other  point  in  the  parameter  space  gives  employers  some  monopsony 
power.” (from Manning).

Note,  another  implication,  because  workers  only  switch  employers  in  response  to  a  higher 
wage offer, workers that have been in the labour market longer are more likely to be earning a 
higher wage (and be at the firm longer). 
 
For  more  introduction  on  this  elegant  model  and  interesting  extensions,  see  Manning’s  book 
and also 
 
Dale T. Moretnsen, ‘Wage Dispersion: Why are similar workers paid differently?”, MIT press. 
 
 
Main interesting implications of model: 
 

1)  wages rise with experience 
2)  exogenous  (involuntary?)  unemployment  shocks  assumed  and  necessary  for  solving 
model 
3)  Identical workers at firms with same technology paid differently 
4)  Firms have monopsony power and make profit 

 
Empirical Evidence? 
 
An  implication  of  the  Burdett-Mortensen  model  is  that  luck  may  play  a  role  in  labor  market 
success.    Identical  workers  randomly  assigned  an  initial  job  potentially  end  up  with  very 
different  lifetime earnings.  It’s an empirical question whether this,  in fact, occurs, and sceptics 
don’t  find  the  current  evidence  convincing.    The  existence  of  firm  fixed  effects,  controlling  for 
individual  fixed  effects  may  reflect  an  interaction  between  high  productivity  workers  and  high 
productivity  firms,  or  unobserved  changes  in  individual  productivity  that  are  not  controlled  for 
by  the  average  individual  fixed  effects.    Francis  Kramarz  and  John  Abowd  are  doing  a  lot  of 
interesting  work  in  this  area  to  try  and  uncover  the  interactions  of  the  firm  using  French  and 
U.S.  panel  employer/employee  data.    These  are  powerful  datasets  that  open  up  a  lot  of 
possibilities for future research.

Jacobson  Lalonde,  and  Sullivan  (AER  93)  exploit  employer-employee  data  to  examine  the 
wage  dynamics  from  unexpected  job  loss.    The  Burdett-Moretensen  model  predicts  job  loss 
lower wages for those that lose their jobs, as they end up trying to climb the wage ladder again 
from  the  bottom.    In  a  perfectly  competitive  setting,  workers  should  be  able  to  obtain  similar 
paying  jobs  at  other  firms,  and  we  shouldn’t  observe  a  long  run  impact.    There  are  other 
reasons  to expect a prolonged  impact  from  job  loss, especially  in  the presence of specific  firm 
capital.   But  the analysis  is  informative  in  that mild and  temporary  impact  from  job  loss shocks 
would be evidence against the Burdett-Moretensen model. 
 
JLS  have  quarterly  data  over  15  years  from  government  administrative  records  in 
Pennsylvania.   
 
Sample is: workers at same firm for 6 years between 1974-80. 
 
‘Treated’  Group:  workers  that  left  firm  in  quarter  where  at  least  30%  of  firm’s  labor  force  left 
(e.g. mass layoff or firm closure).  This is an attempt to identify exogenous job loss. 
 
‘Control’ Group: The rest of the sample 
 
Note,  data  limitation  is  that  can’t  identify  workers  with  zero  earnings  as  those  unemployed  or 
those  that  left  the state.   JSL drop 25% of  the sample of separators  that no  longer show up  in 
the sample after displacement.  They also restrict sample so that every worker in it has at least 
some wage or salary earnings in one quarter per year.  They do this to focus on wage loses do 
to  lower  paying  jobs  rather  than  to  unemployment.    They  argue  this  sample  selection  likely 
biases the effects of unexpected job loss downwards. 
 
Figure 1 
 
An omitted variables bias concern is that displaced workers are not the same in productivity as 
retained workers.  JSL estimate the following model:

coefficients indicating the average effect of displacement  k  quarters since displacement.  W ith 
the panel data, we  can estimate  the effect even prior  to displacement actually occurring.   The 
fixed effect captures average earnings  for each  individual prior to displacement.  So to identify 
this,  we  need  to  observe  earnings  of  at  least  some  displaced  workers more  than  m   quarters 
before  displacement.    JSL  has  at  least  6  years  of  predisplacement  data.    In  effect,  the 
individual fixed effects are average (age-adjusted) earnings over roughly these six years. 
 
Finally,  to account  for  the possibility  that  individual productivity  is changing over  time, and  that 
change is correlated with displacement, JSL add individual linear time trends:

Even 6 years after displacement, quarterly wages are $1,600 lower than the control group’s. 
 
Relative  wage  differences  begin  even  before  displacement,  which  is  a  bit  disturbing.    JSL 
suggest  (exogenous)  events  leading  up  to  the  displacement  also  lead  to  lower  wages  before 
displacement.    They  suggest  the  rate  of  temporary  layoffs may  increase  prior  to mass-layoffs 
or  firm  closures.    Slower  wage  growth  in  these  firms  may  also  have  this  effect.    The  finding 
that the wage diversion prior to displacement does not continue past 4 years prior is somewhat 
assuring. 
 
Figure  3  shows  the  same,  but  for workers  that  leave,  but  not  from  a mass-layoff  firm.    These 
workers are more likely to be leaving voluntarily, and catch up occurs.

These tables are similar to the JSL analysis, but with a sample of Canadian workers. 
 
The  sample  is  all  older  workers  (around  40)  in  same  firm  between  1978-80.    The  ‘treated 
group’  was  at  a  firm  that  closed  in  1980.    The  control  group  was  never  at  a  firm  that 
experienced a closure the year they were working there, between 78-88. 
 
The data also tracks individuals even if they are not working, but filing taxes (unlike JSL). 
 
Canada experienced a particularly bad recession in 82-83. 
 
The  last  table  shows  the  coefficients  on  log  earnings  marked  by  the  year  since  firm  closure 
(including  individual  fixed  effects  and  individual  time  trends).    There  is  some  slippage  in  the 
timing  because  a  closure  is defined as  the  firm does not  file employment  reports after  year 0, 
so the closure could have taken place over a 2 year window.

That wages never catch up is surprising (disturbing?).   
 
This  is  a  sample  of  fathers.    The  dataset  contains  matched  children  who  were  11-14  when 
father’s  lost  their  job.    I  have  earnings  data  of  the  children  when  they  are  25-30  and  am 
examining  whether  there  are  differences  between  earnings  fathers  from  the  bankruptcy 
sample to fathers from the ‘control’.
