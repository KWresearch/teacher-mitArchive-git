1 Evidence on economic discrimination

There is a large empirical literature testing for the presence of discrimination in market and

non-market settings. Studies can be roughly broken into the following categories:

1. Regression studies. These models attempt to interpret the meaning of a race or gender

coeﬃcient in an OLS model, typically a wage model. These studies often use a Oaxaca-

Blinder decomposition to interpret the magnitude of ﬁndings. These analyses do not for

the most part meet contemporary standards of evidence. The 1996 JPE paper by Neal

and Johnson is a rare exception of a contemporary regression study that had a ma jor

impact.

2. Audit studies and ‘kindred’ ﬁeld experiments. These studies attempt to ‘randomize’ race

to evaluate if minorities are treated diﬀerently in job application, housing search, vehicle

purchases, etc. Thanks to the Bertrand-Mullainathan innovation of using resumes to

randomize applicant characteristics, this literature is enjoying a resurgence.

3. Lab experiments. In a non-market setting, experimenters look for evidence of disparate

treatment of members of race or gender groups.

4. Quasi-experiments where race/gender is alternatively revealed or concealed. There are

few studies in this genre. The Goldin-Rouse paper in the AER in 2001 is a nice one.

5. Learning models: Apply structural models to make inferences about what employers

believe initially and how they update beliefs as productivity is revealed over time. The

key tool here is to use information known to the econometrician at market entry (such as

test scores) but not known by employers except through its revealed eﬀect on productivity

or its correlation with other observables.

2 Experimental studies: Fershtman and Gneezy (2001, QJE)

There are numerous experimental studies of discrimination. This is a particularly nice one.

Basic idea: Randomize the ethnic identity of player faced in a series of games. Look for disparate

2

treatment in games that attempt to isolate taste-based and statistical motives for possible

discrimination.

Question: Do Ashkenazic and Eastern Jews appear to discriminate against one another.

Four questions:

1. Is there diﬀerential treatment based on ethnic aﬃliation?

2. Does the discrimination reﬂect group bias in that each player favors members of his own

group — or is there systematic discrimination by all against some?

3. Is discrimination simply taste-based or does it reﬂect the players’ assessments of the

diﬀering reactions of members of groups to their actions (i.e., retaliation).

4. Are these assessments (stereotypes) accurate?

On this fourth point, note that statistical discrimination based on bad statistics (i.e., in-

accurate assessments) is notionally distinct from simple taste-based discrimination, but unlike

‘accurate statistical discrimination,’ it’s not a ‘rational’ economic response to group diﬀerences.

All experiments involve transfers of money between players. Transactions are done without

personal contact, but names are written on paper, and are identiﬁably ethnic. All transactions

occur over several days — so, the expectation of immediacy that might act like a disciplinary

device for cooperation is absent. All results focus on males until end of paper.

Findings:

• Trust game:
• Transfer money to a player. Experimenter triples it. Recipients decides how much to
return.

• Figure I: Male A Jews receive much larger transfers on average than male E Jews. In
fact, 60% get the full amount (approximately equal to $25 × 3).
• Figures IIIa and IIIb: Remarkably, E and A Jews treat E and A Jews similarly. In other
words, neither group appears to ‘trust’ E Jews as much as A Jews.

3

• Is this statistical discrimination — i.e., are E Jews less ‘trustworthy?’ See Table II. There
do not appear to be any diﬀerences in average amounts returned by E and A Jews (would

be interesting to see distributions as well as means).

• Taste for discrim: Dictator Game.
• Same as trust game — transfer money, experimenter triples — but in this case, Player B is
completely passive. No money can be returned. So, it’s just taste for generosity.

• See Figure IV. Here, the average transfers to each ethnic group are similar but the distri-
butions are not. More A Jews received zero, more E Jews received 5. Again, the ethnicity

of the sender was not predictive of the amount sent — only the ethnicity of the recipient.

• Stereotypes: Reaction to unfair treatment. Ultimatum game
• There is a belief that E Jews are more likely than A Jews to act harshly in response to
a perception of unfairness, i.e., have a greater sense of honor/humiliation.

• Test this with Ultimatum game. Here, Player A proposes a division. The amount given
to Player B is tripled. Then Player B can accept or refuse.

• See Figure V. In this case, E Jews generally receive more. The modal A Jew receives 5
of 20 NIS (which will be tripled to 15, so this is an equal division ex post). The modal E

Jew receives 10 of 20 NIS, which will be tripled to 30, so he gets a larger share of pie.

• One interpretation: Honor. A second interpretation (not in paper): Pandering. Players
may not believe that E Jews will correctly understand that ‘5’ is an equal division — and

hence will reject.

• Is this discrimination rational? No evidence that E Jews systematically more likely to
reject an oﬀer...

• Gender diﬀerences:
• Women do not appear to take ethnicity or gender into account.

4

• Conclusions
• A puzzling mix.
1. There are clearly ma jor diﬀerences in how males treat other males by ethnicity.

2. But, this disparate treatment is not own-group biased. Both E and A Jews treat E

Jews diﬀerently from A Jews. It appears they trust E Jews less.

3. But E Jews do not appear less trustworthy conditional on receiving a transfer.

4. Does not appear motivated by animus. In the Dictator game, groups receive roughly

equal treatment.

5. In the ultimatum game, behavior of proposers is consistent with beliefs that other

group will conform to stereotype of honor/humiliation.

6. But no evidence that groups do behave this way.

• Appears to be statistical discrimination based on bad statistics...
• Question: How much can we learn from lab experiments about the importance of dis-
crimination in markets at the margin (as opposed to on average). One can choose to

draw strong inferences from these ﬁndings or dismiss them entirely based because they

are ‘artiﬁcial.’

3 ‘Market’ studies: Orchestrating Impartiality, Goldin and Rouse (AER,
2001)

This is a very creative study that attempts to isolate the importance of gender preference in

a more natural, market-like (albeit rareﬁed) setting: orchestra auditions. Very simple idea:

During the 1970s since 1990s, some orchestras started using screens during solo auditions to

hide the identity of auditioners. Women were historically viewed as unsuitable for orchestras.

Did the use of blind screens improve their chances of getting a job?

• See Table 1 for summary on the implementation of screens
• See Figure 3 for long-term trends in female hiring
5

• Table 4: On average, women do worse on blind rounds. But this could be due to changing
composition of female pool. Possible that only the very best women competed when the

game was lopsided.

• Table 5: Models limited to musicians (male and female) who auditioned both blind and
non-blind suggest that women did relatively better in blind rounds (diﬀ-females minus

diﬀ-males).

• Table 6 gives the main estimates.
• All of these models exclude orchestra ﬁxed eﬀects because there is no ‘within’ variation
in orchestra blind policies.

• Table 7 estimates models for the 3 orchestras that switch policies, can include musician
and orchestra ﬁxed eﬀects. Results are similar to Table 6, but less precise.

• Conclusion: Fascinating. Hard to generalize.
4 Audit studies and field experiments: Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003)

Limitation of canonical audit studies:

1. Tiny samples b/c expensive

2. Not double-blind. Experimenters may have an agenda.

3. Artiﬁcial setting: Experimenters do not intend to complete the transaction (e.g., take the

job, buy the car, rent the apartment...)

4. Do not necessarily measure discrimination at the margin

Great idea: Apply for jobs by sending resume by mail or fax. Manipulate perceptions of

race by using distinctively ethnic names. Otherwise, hold constant resume characteristics. Are

‘callback’ rates lower for distinctively black-named applicants?

• Table 1: Short answer is yes. Callback rates are lower for black sounding names.

6

• Table 2: In most cases, names receive equal treatment (a point James Heckman made
about audit studies in his JEP article in the symposium on race listed on your syllabus).

But that’s because in most cases, applicants are not called back.

• Table 4: Black names appear to beneﬁt less from resume enhancements (such as hon-
ors, more experience) than do whites. Authors view this as evidence against statistical

discrimination — should work in opposite direction they believe. Is this true?

• See also Table 5
• Table 6: Discrimination based on zip-code characteristics appears quite important, and
does not systematically diﬀer between white and non-white names. (Authors also view

this as evidence against statistical discrimination.) This does not seem to greatly reduce

importance of racial ‘soundingness’ of names.

• Table 11: Considerable overlap in distributions of outcomes between white and black
sounding names

Conclusion: Controversial paper that will spark a great deal of other work in this vein.

Questions remaining: How do we translate call backs into outcomes we care about? What is

the model of statistical discrimination they are contrasting their ﬁndings too?

4.1 Responses

There are already two response papers to B-M.

One is by Levitt and Fryer, who show using detailed birth records data that non-white

names not substantially correlated with life outcomes once one conditions ﬁnely on mother/birth

characteristics. B-M response: Not a surprise; it’s not the name, and that’s name is taken as

proxy for race when race is shielded.

The paper by Figlio presents some fascinating initial evidence that names do matter. Within

families, children who receive distinctively black names appear to have slightly lower test scores,

are less likely to be labeled as ‘gifted,’ and are more likely to be labeled ‘learning disabled.’

5 Regression Studies: Neal and Johnson (1996)

• This is the rare modern regression study that had a ma jor impact. Why? Because what
it give up in cleverness it more than compensates for in substance.

• This work is related to Bel l Curve (1994), which generate a huge response literature by
economists and sociologists in the late-1990s.

• See also Heckman’s superb review of this book in the JPE.
• Basic question: How much of the B/W earnings gap is explained by diﬀerences in skills
that are formed prior to market entry? This is a great question because so much of

literature is focused on market discrimination. Is this focus misplaced. NJ say yes.

• Ideal test: Look at identically skilled teens before market entry and then again later in
life: What is the initial earnings gap and does it grow over time. Assuming there are

no diﬀs in tastes or costs of skill investment, one could attribute diﬀs to discrimination.

(Idea is akin to randomly assigning race.)

• Since can’t do that, use NLSY. Sample 15 to 23 years old, who took AFQT prior to age
18. Regress age eﬀects out of AFQT.

• See Table 1: The basic result. ‘Pre-market’ skill appears to explain a large part of racial
earnings gap for currently employed workers.

• This is the main message of the paper. Now, they ask a bunch of good questions.
5.1 Is AFQT racially biased?

• Military has done validation studies using ob jective performance measures. Finds no
evidence that test systematically under-predicts performance of blacks.

5.2 Do blacks underinvest in skills b/c return is lower?

• This is exceedingly diﬃcult to test.

8

• In Table 2 and 3, no evidence of diﬀerences in return to AFQT. But this is an endogenous
comparison — conditional on having attained a given level of skill.

• Moreover, return may have been lower in prior eras, and this could aﬀect beliefs of black
parents, who choose how much to invest in kids’ skills.

• How would you convincingly test this? What does this imply that we should see for IV
estimates of returns to school for blacks versus whites?

5.3 Selection into labor market participation

• See Figure 1. Low scoring blacks noticeably less likely to participate in labor market.
• How do we deal with this? Two approaches:
• 1. Median regressions. If nonparticipants have wage oﬀers less than median for group
with similar observables (race, test score) and at least half participate, then the median

is identiﬁed. Bingo. See Table 4. This table suggests that less is explained of the gap

once we condition on participation.

• 2. Smith and Welch method (this is kind of cool):
E (w) = LF P R · E (w|participate) + (1 − LF P R) · E (w|don’t participate) .
Therefore

=

,

where

E (wi)
E (wj )

LF P Ri · E (wi |participate) + (1 − LF P Ri) · E (wi |don’t participate)
LF P Rj · E (wj |participate) + (1 − LF P Rj ) · E (wj |don’t participate)
(1 − kj ) LF P Rj + kj ¸ ,
= ∙ E (wi |participate)
E (wj |participate) ¸ · ∙ (1 − ki ) LF P Ri + ki
E (wi)
E (wj )
E (wi |don’t participate)
.
ki =
E (wi |participate)
So, can adjust the observed earnings ratio by a selection factor. Notice that OLS wage
gap is −0.072 and median gap is −0.134, implying
E (wj |participate) ¸ = 0.93
∙ E (wi |participate)
9

and

(1 − kj ) LF P Rj + kj ¸ = 0.875.
= ∙ E (wi |participate)
E (wj |participate) ¸ · ∙ (1 − ki) LF P Ri + ki
E (wi)
E (wj )
Using kb = kw = 0.1 and noting that LF P Rb = 0.91 and LF P Rw = 0.94, we have
∙ (1 − 0.1) · 0.91 + 0.1
(1 − 0.1) · 0.975 + 0.1 ¸ = 0.94,

and

0.93 · 0.94 = 0.874.
So, by making a very conservative assumption on potential earnings of non-employed,

we get back the observed ratio. Of course, this calculation does not account for AFQT

scores (it’s treated as unconditional). If score gap is much larger among non-employed,

this suddenly does not seem so conservative.

5.4 Determinants of AFQT scores

• Figures 2 and 3.
• Figures 5 and 6.
• There is a 1.0 SD test score gap. This is very large. (But both groups have gained more
than this amount over century due to ‘Flynn eﬀect.’)

• Adding a bunch of family background, home environment, and school quality covari-
ates reduces this considerably. Suggests that pre-market factors have a lot of potential

explanatory power for this gap.

• Bel l Curve argued these score diﬀerences are genetic — inherent ability.
• But score gap is larger in older cohorts, suggesting skills investment (Table A3)
• When quarter-of-birth used as instrument for schooling, signiﬁcantly increases AFQT
(not shown). Again suggests some part of cognitive skill acquired.

6 Learning Models: Farber and Gibbons (1996)

Though it may not seem immediately related, the 1996 QJE paper by Farber and Gibbons con-

tributes to economic understanding of how information is resolved over time in labor markets.

The follow-up paper by Altonji and Pierret, QJE 2001, shows exactly how the tools developed

by F&G can be used to test for the presence of statistical discrimination (something Farber

and Gibbons may have overlooked).

Basic idea:

• When a person enters the labor market, some things about productivity are known to
employers, but much is not yet known.

• Given the right data, there may be things about productivity known to econometrician
that cannot be known to employers (like AFQT scores).

• Employers should learn this productivity information as they gather information about
workers’ productivity.

• Question: What does this learning process imply about wage dynamics?
Two strong initial assumptions:

1. Wages equal expected output at each date (no long term contracts).

2. “The stochastic component of a worker’s output has a time invariant distribution, so

human capital acquisition is deterministic, and both innate ability and acquired skill

have the same value in all jobs.” [Translation: error distribution for individual wages is

stable at all times, so expected output at any give data is all we need to know for wage

determination.]

11

6.1 Theory: Time invariant worker characteristics

• Let η i and si describe worker’s time-invariant ability and (ﬁxed) schooling.
• Assumption: η i not observed by employers directly
• Let Xi be a vector of time-invariant worker attributes (race, gender, date of birth) ob-
servable to employers and included in data.

• Let Zi be a vector of time-invariant worker attributes that are not included in data.
• Let Bi be a vector of time-invariant worker characteristics that are observed in data but
not by employers (such as test scores).

• Write the joint distribution of these attributes as F (η i , si , Xi , Zi , Bi) .
• Let yit be the output of worker i in the tth period in which she is labor market.
• Assume that outputs {yit : t = 1, ..., T } are independent draws from conditional distrib-
ution G (yit |η i , si , Xi , Zi ) Note that Bi does not appear in this expression, meaning that
it only aﬀects productivity through its relation to other variables (such as η).

• Now assume
1. All employers know the joint distribution F (η i , si , Xi , Zi , Bi) and conditional distri-
bution G (yit |η i , si , Xi , Zi ).
2. All observe schooling si and other worker characteristics Xi , Zi .
3. All observe the sequence of outputs {yi1 , ..., yiT }. This last assumption is not mild:
‘public learning.’

• Given these assumptions, wage paid to a worker is expected output given all available
information

wit = E (yit |si , Xi , Zi , yi1 , ..., yit−1 ) .
• The rest of the theoretical part of the paper develops implications. These arguments are
subtle, but intuition is pretty accessible.

12

6.2 Three predictions: (1) Effect of schooling on wages

• Consider a cohort of workers entering the labor market simultaneously. For each worker,
we observe si , Xi and the wage, but not output.

• We estimate the following equation for the level of earnings (one thing that’s unusual
about the theory: written in levels not logs, which therefore requires them do the analysis

in levels).

wit = αt + β tsi + Xiγ t + εit .

Estimated coeﬃcients from this regression are coeﬃcients from linear pro jection of wit on
si and Xi . A linear pro jection is analogous to a conditional expectation function (CEF)
except that we have constrained the relationship to linearity. [It could be that the true

conditional expectation of structural equation is a non-linear function of independent

variables.] Most of us use this terminology loosely, but the F&G usage is more precise.

• Denote linear pro jection as E ∗ (·).
E ∗ (wit |si , Xi ) = ˆαt + ˆβ tsi + Xi ˆγ t ,
where the dhats denote estimated coeﬃcients. Now, iterate expectations:
E ∗ (E ∗ (y |X, Z )|X )) = E ∗ (y |X ) .
So, although Zi , Bi are not included in the data, employers will still be able to form
unbiased estimates of expected worker productivity just using the X 0s. Why? Because
the estimated coeﬃcients ˆα, ˆβ , ˆγ eﬀectively contain the implicit regression of Z , B , on X .
So, the omitted variable bias formula says that the coeﬃcients obtained from estimating

(1)

(1) account for the direct eﬀect of X on w plus the covariance between X and Z, B and

the eﬀects of Z, B on w. [You should review/remind yourself of the omitted variable bias

formula if you are not already intimately familiar with it. See any intro econometrics

text.]

• Some additional iterations gives you
E ∗ (wit |si , Xi) = E ∗ (yit |si , Xi) ,
13

meaning that the regression equations gives expected output (equal to the wage by as-

sumption).

• Now, given the assumption that outputs are identically distributed, this arguments says
that the eﬀect of schooling on the level of wages is independent of experience.

• Intuition (badly needed...). Assumption that wages equal expected output implies not
only that 1st period wage wi1 is expectation of ﬁrst period output given si , Xi but also
that no part of ‘innovation in wages’ between periods 1 and 2, wi2 − wi1 , can be forecast
from the information used to determine wi1 . This does not necessarily mean that wages
are not expected to grow between these two periods (although, in this version of the

model, they are not — but see below). They key condition is that the ‘surprise’ element of

this growth cannot be forecasted from time invariant characteristics. So this means that

education’s eﬀect on wages is the same in all periods. (Note, in this version of the model:

current age and experience are not included in Xi because they are not time invariant.).

• Thus, wi2 is equal to wi1 plus a term that depends on yi1 but is orthogonal to si , Xi ,
wi2 − wi1 . This means that the estimated coeﬃcients for β , γ are the same in all periods.
Note that this does not necessarily apply to α.

6.3 Three predictions: (2) Effect of unobserved characteristics

• This second prediction is most important of model.
• Recall that Bi is observed by econometrician but not by employers.
• Other observed variables X, Z, s could be correlated with B , however. So let’s purge this
correlation using the following procedure:

B ∗i = Bi − E (Bi |si , Xi , wi1 ) .
Note that we are including wi1 because it contains (by assumption) employers’ expectation
of productivity at market entry, so by conditioning this out, we are in theory purging

everything about Bi that employers may observe.

14

• Now augment previous regression equation
wit = αt + β tsi + Xiγ t + B ∗i π t + εit .

• Question: How will π t vary with experience? (This is the ‘learning’ part of the model.)
Take B to be scalar. Since B ∗ is orthogonalized from other regressors, we know that

ˆπ t =

cov (B ∗i , wit )
var (B ∗i )

.

Now, note that

ζ it ,

TPt=2
wit = wit−1 + ζ it = wi1 +
where ζ it is equal to the ‘innovation’ in wages in each period following the 1st.
• Since B ∗i is orthogonal to wi1 by construction, ˆπ0 = 0. Therefore
TPt=2
cov (B ∗i , ζ it ) .
cov (B ∗i , wit ) =
In general, this term cov (B ∗i , ζ it ) will be positive for all t > 0. If that regularity condition
is satisﬁed, then ˆπ t will be rising in t. This is the key result: as experience accumultes,
employers will learn about η , and this makes B ∗i increasingly (important) for wage deter-
mination.

• Intuition: B ∗i
is correlated with ability, and ability aﬀects output. Employers do not
observe B ∗i at market entry, but they will learn about output over time. Therefore, the
eﬀect of ability — and hence B ∗i — should be rising with market experience. This is quite
a nice prediction. It’s sensible enough to be intuitive, but suﬃciently non-obvious that

testing it has power to aﬃrm/reject the plausiblity of the model. Notice: there is no

experiment, but still a good test of theory.

6.4 Three predictions: (3) Wage residuals are a martingale

• A martingale is a generalization of a random walk. A random walk has the following two
properties:

E (wit+1 |wit ) = wit ,
15

(2)

var (E (wit+1 |wit )) = σ2 ,
where σ2 is not time varying. Note that unconditional variance of wit rises unboundedly
with t.

(3)

• Like a random walk, a martingale has the the ﬁrst conditional expectation property. But
the second property is more general:

var (E (wit+1 |wit )) = σ2
t .
That is, the variance of ‘innovations’ is not necessarily constant. So, a random walk is a

martingale, but a martingale may not be a random walk.

• The martingale property applies readily to the F&G model. Because wages are assumed
to incorporate all contemporaneous information on expected productivity, the expected

innovation in each period is zero:

which implies that

E (ζ it |wit−1 ) = 0,

E (wit |wit−1 ) = wit−1 .
Since successive observations of the wage can be written as
TPt=2
where ζ it are uncorrelated due to the independence of draws assumption. Therefore,
TPt=2
Var(wit ) =Var(wi1 ) +
t . This implies that wages (or at least their residuals) are a
σ2
martingale.
6.5 Productivity that grows with experience

wit = wi1 +

ζ it ,

• The problem so far is that they’ve not really allowed for productivity growth.
• Assume now that productivity grows over time due to experience, human capital, etc.:

Yit = yit + h(t),

16

where t is time, and h(t) is the component of output growth due to acquired skill (yit is
the part due to ﬁxed characteristics like ability).

• Continue to assume that {yi1 , ..., yiT } are iid draws from G (yit |η i , si , Xi , Zi ).
• Of course, {Yi1 , ..., YiT } are not iid, but if h(t) is deterministic or deterministic plus white
noise, then the regression equation becomes something like

wit = α0 + α1 t + β 0si + β 1si t + εit .

So, by conditioning on a trend in experience and education, we can get back to a (condi-

tional) iid case.

6.6 Farber and Gibbons: Results

• F&G use the NLSY to examine the earnings dynamics of a cohort of workers. The key
features of the NLSY for this analysis:

1. Panel data — can observe wage dynamics

2. AFQT — correlated with productivity, probably not initially fully observed by em-

ployers

3. Can measure actual experience rather than potential experience.

• First step is to construct B ∗i as

B ∗i = Bi − Xi ˆγ − ˆδwi0 .
By regressing out other observables and the 1st period wage, will have orthogonalized this

measure to components that are presumably not known at labor market entry. Though

if there is measurement error in wage or if wage does not perfectly reﬂect expected pro-

ductivity, this is not going to be quite perfect.

• Table 2 tests their two of three of their main hypotheses:
1. Estimate eﬀect of education on level of wages does not vary with experience

17

2. Estimated eﬀect of variables correlated with ability but not observed by the market

increases with experience (this is the most important prediction of the paper).

• Since regressions are in levels, hard to read. But the estimated return to education is
roughly 9 percent, which is plausible in this time period, 1981 - 1990.

• There is no evidence that the relationship between education and earnings varies with
time, exactly as the learning model predicts. (This is tested by interacting education with

experience; experience is almost synonymous with time within a cohort.)

• This ﬁnding is sensitive to inclusion/exclusion of education × year eﬀects; when these are
excluded, interaction is signiﬁcant. This is not surprising given the very rapid rise in the

return to education during this period; this will look like an ‘age’ eﬀect if we don’t make
it into a ‘time’ eﬀect by adding education × time.
• Most striking are the ‘returns’ on the AFQT (and library card) residuals. The interactions
between these variables and experience is positive, signiﬁcant and large in all speciﬁca-

tions. This suggests that employers learn about these variables over time, and so they

become ‘priced’ into the wage.

• One concern here is that result could be contaminated by a rise in the return to ability
over this period — again, the general identiﬁcation problem in distinguishing age from

time eﬀects. But F&G results are robust to addition of interactions between calendar

dummies and the AFQT and library card variables. This suggests that they have found

something real.

• The ﬁnal question that F&G address is whether wages are a martingale. This is of great
technical interest if you do optimal minimum distance (OMD) estimation and/or error

components models. This material (which draws on seminal 1984 work by Chamberlain),

is deeply important if you want to work on dynamic problems with panel data. The

martingale result is probably not of great substantive import to us, however, and so I will

not spend class time on it.

18

6.7 Conclusion: Farber and Gibbons

This is an original and important paper that presents a rigorous way to think about a diﬃcult

problem — wage dynamics with employer learning. The key result (in my mind) is that unmea-

sured skill becomes increasingly important to wage setting over time, as employers’ learn about

ability. The intuition for this result is quite natural, and that makes the ﬁnding all the more

powerful.

Digression: A note on age, time, and cohort eﬀects

• Write the wage of a person

wiatm = γ a + δ t + θm + εit ,

where a indexes age, t indexes calendar time, and y indexes the year of i0s labor market
entry. In this notation, γ is an age eﬀect, δ is a time eﬀect, and θ is a cohort eﬀect.

• In theory, all of these ‘eﬀects’ can be said to exist. That is, there can be a pure wage
eﬀect of age (or experience), a pure eﬀect of time (operating through price changes, for

example), and a pure eﬀect of being a member of a given cohort (if that cohort has special

attributes or, equivalently, if cohorts are imperfect productive substitutes).

• However, there is a fundamental identiﬁcation problem in measuring these three eﬀects
simultaneously. Conditional on year of market entry, age and time are perfectly linearly

related — that is, calendar time is simply year of market entry plus age minus age at

market entry. So, although we can write this decomposition, we can never estimate all

three components simultaneously.

• This identiﬁcation problem arises repeatedly in labor economics. In particular, if wages
are rising for a group of workers, is it because they are getting older (an age eﬀect) or

because prices are rising (a time eﬀect)? We’ll talk more about this issue in the spring

semester.

19

7 Learning Models: Altonji and Pierret (2001)

Altonji and Pierret pick up a thread that Farber and Gibbons left hanging. F&G considered

how employer learning aﬀects the evolution of the wage loading of variables that employers

do not originally observe. They did not consider what this implies about the evolution of
coeﬃcients for variables that: employers do originally observe and which are correlated with

observables variables that they do not observe.

In fact, their estimation strategy precludes

investigating this possibility because they purge Bi of correlations with all observables and the
1st period wage.

Here’s where A&P come in. Let’s say, for example, that race is correlated with AFQT

score, and that employers know this. If employers value AFQT score (because of its link to

productivity) and use race (or education) as a statistical signal of expected AFQT (that is,

they statistically discriminate), this has an immediate implication for the evolution of both the

AFQT and race (or education) coeﬃcient. Speciﬁcally, AFQT should become more important

in wage setting over the workers’ career, whereas conditional on AFQT, race (or education)

should become less important. This is what Altonji and Pierret test.

There are a few important diﬀerences between A&P and F&G:

1. A&P do their analysis in logs, which is slightly easier to deal with.

2. Unlike F&G, they do not orthogonalize Bi with respect to Xi , wi0 . This is crucial. If
B is orthogonal to other covariates, changes in its loading on wages over time cannot by

construction aﬀect the coeﬃcients on variables in X such as schooling. Hence, their test

requires them not to orthogonalize.

3. They look at statistical discrimination on education and race.

• I won’t develop their model, but the intuition is stated succinctly on page 321, “As
employers learn about the productivity of workers, s [which is an observable variable,

such as schooling] will get less of the credit for an association with productivity that

arises because s is correlated with z [variable like AFQT that is initially unobserved, but

is positively correlated with both s and output], provided that z is included in the wage

equation with a time-dependent coeﬃcient and can claim the credit.”

7.1 Results for education as a signal of ability

• See Tables I, II, III. Results here are quite striking.
• In Table I, ﬁrst column shows that both education and AFQT have an important eﬀect
on wages, and that the eﬀect of education declines insigniﬁcantly with time.

• In column (2), they add AFQT × time/10. Coeﬃcients imply that AFQT has essentially
zero eﬀect on wages in year of market entry but by year 10, a one standard deviation

higher AFQT raises earnings by 7 log points.

• Most strikingly, addition of this measure dramatically changes the eﬀect of education on
earnings. In the ﬁrst year, the ‘return’ to education is now 8.3 log points (up from 5.9 in
the model excluding AFQT × time).
• But the education × time interaction is strongly negative. After 10 years in the market,
the eﬀect of education is only 6.0 log points.

• This suggests that employers are ‘statistically discriminating’ on education — that is, they
are initially using education as a proxy of unobserved ability, and they rely on this less

as ability becomes known.

• Results using sibling wage and father’s education work similarly. All can be thought of
correlates of underlying productivity that become know to employers with time.

7.2 Is race used for statistical discrimination

• A&P report a 1.1 standard deviation black/white mean diﬀerence on the AFQT in their
sample — large, but consistent with Neal and Johnson.

• Let’s say employers statistically discriminate on race as a proxy for AFQT.
• Absent the AFQT × time measure, we would expect race to be negative.
• Adding AFQT × time should make the race main eﬀect more negative, but make the time
interaction more positive. That is, if race is taken as a (negative) productivity signal early

21

in the career, it should become less important as actual productivity is revealed.

[This

does not mean that expectations are inaccurate, but that they are coorborated by AFQT

latter — and so AFQT eventually becomes the determinant, not race.]

• Table I shows that the opposite occurs. That is, the race main eﬀect becomes substan-
tially larger when the AFQT × time interaction is added, and this time interaction is
signiﬁcantly negative. This does not support the inference that employers are using race

as a s variable like schooling.

• In fact, a more likely interpretation is the opposite: employers are not ‘accounting’ for
racial diﬀerences in expected productivity at hire (witness: the race intercept is insignif-

icantly positive in year 0 of market entry) and then are learning about this over time.

They appear ‘surprised.’

• This suggest that employers are obeying the legal prohibition on statistical discrimination.
• Other explanations?
