Credit Constraint Effects 
 
There  are  substantial  differences  in  college  participation  rates  across  family  income  classes  each 
year.  
 
(e.g. see Carneiro and Heckman, EJ 2002, Figure 1).   
 
Children  from  families  in  the  highest  income  quartile  are  much  more  likely  to  attend  college  than 
children from families in the bottom quartile (about 75% versus 45%).  There are two, not necessarily 
mutually  exclusive  interpretations  of  this  evidence.    I  will  add  a  third  later  on.    The  common 
interpretation and  the one that guides much policy  is that credit constraints facing families in a child’s 
adolescent  years  affect  the  resources  required  to  finance  a  college  education.    If  families  face 
difficulties or are averse  to borrowing  to pay  for college,  than children  from  lower  income  families will 
be  less  likely  to  go  to  college,  even  if  facing  the  same  benefits  from  it  as  others  from  higher  income 
families. 
 
A  second  interpretation  emphasises  more  long  run  factors  associated  with  higher  family  income.  
Families  with  high  income  in  the  adolescent  years  may  also  be  more  likely  to  have  high  income 
throughout  the  child’s  life  at  home.    Better  family  resources  in  a  child’s  formative  years  may  be 
associated  with  higher  quality  of  education  and  better  environments  that  foster  cognitive  and 
noncognitive skills. 
 
Both  interpretations  of  the  evidence  are  consistent  with  a  form  of  credit  constraint.    The  first,  more 
common,  interpretation  is  clearly  consistent  with  this  point  of  view.    But  the  second  interpretation  is 
consistent  with  another  type  of  credit  constraint:  the  inability  of  the  child  to  buy  the  parental 
environment  and  genes  that  form  the  cognitive  and  noncognitive  abilitites  required  for  success  in 
school.    Relaxing  borrowing  constraints  at  the  college  level  will  only  have  an  impact  under  the  first 
case and not the second.

Card argues  that a possibility explaining why instrumenting education with college costs yields higher 
returns than OLS suggests credit constraints may be important in school attainment decisions. 
 
 
College Proximity: 
 
Is  it  a  valid  instrument?    College  proximity  only  affects  costs  of  attending  college.    Underlying 
assumption  is  that  ability  distribution  across  regions  are  the  same.      If  you  think  it  helps,  Card  also 
adds city  indicators,  race, and  family background controls.   Living near a college  raises education by 
.32 years. 
 
Concerns: 1) family selection across regions 
 2) college proximity also related to primary and secondary school quality 
 
 
 
 
3) unobserved wage premiums by location 
 
Card  suggests  if  these  omitted  variables  were  correlated  with  college  proximity,  they  the  instrument 
should affect college attendance for all family backgrounds similarly. 
 
Whereas,  for  the  instrument  to  behaving  as  we  think,  where  it  affects  costs  more  for  those  liquidity 
constrained, the first stage should be stronger for lower income families. 
 
(of course, if the unobserved selection also varied by family background, we’d still get this result).

Two ways to come to this conclusion: 
 
First, everyone has the same marginal returns to education, which are declining with more school. 
 
We  can  proxy  an  individual  affected  by  credit  constraints  as  facing  a  higher  discount  rate,  or, more 
generally, higher costs associated with school. 
 
The existence of credit constraints will cause those affected to obtain less education. 
 
An  instrument  for  schooling  that  lowers  college  costs will  lead  to  a  larger  drop  in  costs  for  the  credit 
constrained.

If no one was credit constrained,  the  instrument should  identify  the ATE, since every one affected by 
the cost the same way. 
 
A  similar  conclusion  arises  without  declining  marginal  returns  if  we  have  heterogeneous  ability  and 
individuals that are credit constrained have, on average, higher marginal returns from school 
 
Note, Heckman points out  that  if psychic costs of going  to school are higher  for  those  that  tend  to be 
credit  constrained,  the  response  from  tuition  changes  or  geographic  mobility  does  not  necessarily 
have to be greater for them than non-constrained.

At  the  margin,  reducing  direct  college  costs  affects  credit-constrained  students  more  than  reducing 
foregone earnings by the same amount.

A  fall  in  college  costs  leads  to a greater  increase  in schooling  for credit constrained  individuals more 
than non credit constrained individuals. 
 
A  fall  in  foregone  earnings  by  the  same  amount  affects  schooling  outcomes  constrained  and  non-
constrained individuals the same. 
 
Cameron  and  Taber  suggest  using  these  predictions  as  a  test  for whether  the  IV>OLS  finding  really 
does imply credit constraints. 
 
Cameron  and  Taber’s  suggestion  is  that  IV  using  distance  to  college  >  IV  using  foregone  earnings 
only if credit constraints present. 
 
Cameron  and  Taber  use  a  sample  from  the  NLSY  between  1979  and  1994  to  estimate  returns  to 
schooling  using  college  proximity  and  foregone  earnings  as  instruments.    College  proximity  is 
computed  as  the  presence  of  a  two  or  four  year  college  in  the  county  of  residence  at  age  17.    
Foregone  earnings  are  computed  as  the  average  log  earnings  in  service/agriculture,  and  wholesale 
and  retail  trade  industries by county.   Both are  related  to schooling.   The authors discuss  the validity 
of these instruments in the text: the evidence of validity seems very shaky.   
 
There  main  results  come  from  Tables  3  and  4.    They  find  higher  IV  estimates  than  OLS  when 
instrumenting  foregone earnings, which  is not  consistent with a  liquidity constrained story.   They  find 
smaller  IV  estimates  than  OLS  when  instrumenting  college  proximity  while  controlling  for  foregone 
earnings  (relative  to  average  earnings  in  the  county).    They  also  do  not  find,  as Card  does,  that  the 
college  proximity  variable  matters  more  for  individuals  with  low  income  family  backgrounds.    They 
conclude  there  is no evidence  that  individuals  induced  to  take more school by  lowering college costs 
are credit constrained. 
 
Other Empirical Evidence against credit constraints 
 
Carneiro and Heckman simply argue that the instruments are not valid.

Table 1: 
Proximity  to college  is strongly related  to AFQT (taken before high school), so  is  local unemployment 
rate, which Cameron and Taber use. 
provide  a  critique  of  the  IV  versus  OLS  strategy  to  test  for  credit  constraints.    They  also  accuse  the 
instruments,  such as distance  to college, as being correlated with ability measures  taken during high 
school. 
 
The  paper  cites much work  by Cameron  and Heckman  that  compare  the  estimated  effects  of  family 
background and family income in the child’s adolescent years on college attendance with and without 
controlling for scholastic ability (AFQT).  “Measured scholastic ability is influenced by long-term family 
and  environmental  factors,  which  are  in  turn  produced  by  the  long-term  permanent  income  of 
families.    to  the extent  that  the  influence of  family  income on college attendance  is diminished by  the 
inclusion  of  scholastic  ability  in  an  analysis  of  college  attendance,  one would  conclude  that  long-run 
family  factors  crystallised  in AFQT  scores  are  the driving  force behind  schooling attainment, and not 
short-term credit constraints.   Fitting a  lifecycle model of schooling  to a subsample of  the NLSY data 
on youth with AFQT measured before high school graduation, Cameron and Heckman examine what 
portion of  the gap  in school attendance at various  levels between minority youth and whites  is due to 
family  income,  during  the  adolescent  years,  to  tuition  costs  and  to  family  background.    They  find 
when  not  controlling  for  ability  measured  at  an  early  age,  about  half  of  the  11  point  gap  between 
black  and  white  college  attendance  rates  is  due  to  family  income.    When  scholastic  ability  is 
accounted  for,  less  than  half  of  one  point  of  the  11  point  black  white  gap  is  explained  by  family 
income.    They  conclude  that  ability,  and  not  financial  resources,  in  the  teenage  years  accounts  for 
the pronounced minority majority differences in schoolin attainment.” 
 
Carmeron and Heckman’s idea: the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) was administered to 15-
18 year olds in the NLSY before high school graduation and proxies for the stock of human capital up 
until high school graduation.   
 
Heckman’s  approach  is  essentially  to  compare  the  predicted  ethnic/race  gap  in  college  attendance 
with and without family background controls.

Using  a  subsample  of  the  NLSY  data  on  youth  with  AFQT  measured  before  high  school,  C  and  H

family  income,  to  tuition  costs,  and  to  family  background.    Not  controlling  for  ability measured  at  an 
early  age,  about  half  (5  points)  of  the  11  percentage  point  gap  between  black  and  white  college 
attendance  rates  is  due  to  family  income.    More  than  half  of  the  difference  between  Hispanics  and 
whites  is  due  to  family  income.   When  scholastic  ability  is  accounted  for,  only  about  one  half  of  one 
point  of  the  11  point  black  white  gap  is  explained  for  family  income.    Equalizing  AFQT  scores 
accounts for much of the minority-majority college attendance gaps.

The  disincentive  effects  of  college  tuition  on  college  attendance  are  considerably  weakened  when 
AFQT is added as a control.

Conceptual experiment, vary lottery winners by age of child and observe child outcomes. 
 
Counter argument: Ellwood Kane  
 
Heckman  continues  to  push  hard  on  this  evidence  and  others  to  argue  that  human  capital 
investments  after  young  ages  are  worth  spit.    Ellwood  and  Kane  are  the  only  ones  I  know  that  put 
forth a counter argument: 
 
“Including  parental  education  almost  certainly  captures  more  than  differences  in  parental  tastes  for 
education.    Parental  education,  probably  artificially  picks  up  some  of  the  income  effects  due  to 
measurement error in income and probably more closely measures a family’s long term wealth than a 
single year of  income does.   Moreover,  if children  from poorer  families believe  they are unlikely  to go 
to  school  (because  of  financial  constraints)  they  do  not  work  as  hard  in  school  and  ahieve  lower 
scores and grades, further obscuring the true impact of family income.  Second, even after controlling 
for parental education,  the remaining differences  in college-going by family income are hardly ‘small’.  
Our  results  imply  that  even  when  two  youngsters  have  identical  school  grades  and  test  scores  and 
equally well educated parents,  if one  is poor and one  is well  to do,  their odds of attending school will 
differ by nearly 10 percentage points. 
 
 
How to promote access to college?

Kane,  NBER  WP#5164:  goes  over  more  experimental  evidence  of  effects  of  tuition  and  means-
tested programs on college participation. 
 
Suppose  we  did  decide  that  removing  credit  constraints  were  an  important  policy  objective.    We 
could  do  this  by  subsidizing  tuition  for  everyone  (we  currently  do  a  lot  of  this)  or  we  can  consider  a 
means tested financial aid or scholarship program.  our goal is to lower direct college costs to reduce  
sb τ   for  low  income  families,  subsidizing  tuition  is  an  expensive  way  to  do  it.    Much  of  these 
X
,(

subsidies  are  pure  transfer  from  tax  payer  to  students  that  would  have  attended  college  in  the 
absence  of  public  support.    Why  should  I  subsidize  your  education  if  I  get  nothing  from  it  and  you 
simply  end  up  receiving  the  transfer?    It  is  the  marginal  group  we  are  more  concerned  with:  those 
who  not  have  entered  college  without  the  subsidy.    Kane  estimates  only  11  to  30  percent  of  the 
money  invested  in  keeping  public  tuition  low  goes  to marginal  entrants,  although  it’s  not  clear  to me 
how he gets this number. 
 
“In  theory, means  tested  programs  are  better  targeted  at marginal  youth,  “but  an  important  piece  of 
evidence  should  give  one  pause.    After  the  establishment  of  the  Pell  Grant  program  in  the  mid-
1970s,  there  was  no  disproportionate  growth  in  enrolment  by  low  income  youth.    Since  Pell  Grants 
represent  the  primary  source  of  means-tested  grant  aid  in  the  country,  this  is  troubling.    One  might 
offer  several  different  hypotheses  to  reconcile  the  results.    For  instance,  the  establishment  of  Pell 
Grants  coincided with  an  increase  in  college enrolment by minorities.   Supply  constraints  in  colleges 
and universities may have muted the enrolment response of low-income youth.  The marginal student 
may  simply  have  been  unaware  of  the  process  of  applying  for  Pell  Grants.    Marginal  youth may  be 
more  aware  of  the  ‘sticker  price’  published  in  the  newspapers  than  they  are  capable  of  anticipating 
their financial aid eligibility.” 
 
Kane concludes, “rising college costs do seem to be related to the growing gap in enrolment between 
high  and  low-income  youth  and  between  white  an  minority  youth.    But  the  states  cannot  afford  to 
continue  paying  three-quarters  of  the  cost  of  attendance  at  a  public  university.   Means  tested  aid  is 
abetter targeted but, it seems, less effective in promoting college enrolment.”

Dynarski: 2003 (AER): Does Aid Matter? 
 
This was Sue’s MIT job market paper. 
 
Starting  in  1965,  the  Social  Security  Administration  subsidized  18-22  year  old  children  of  deceased, 
disabled, or retired SS beneficiaries monthly payments while in college full time.  The subsidy worked 
out to be about $6700 in 1980 dollars.  At the program’s peak, 12 percent of full time college students 
received these benefits. 
 
In  1982,  the  program  was  stopped,  with  arguments  that  there  was  already  federal  aid  from  other 
programs and the Pell Grant program had been introduced.

Note, effect is intent to treat: effect from eligibility, rather than from receipt. 
 
Population  of  eligible  children  are  children  with  a  father  that  passed  away  before  turning  18.  
Disabled  or  retired  children  dropped:  parents  have  some  ‘choice’  on  becoming  disabled  or  retired, 
and these incentives go away after 82, so there could be sample selection. 
 
Data from NLSY and identify these variables of interest.  (why not look at earnings?) 
 
Note,  Dynarski  did  look  at  retired  father’s  as  eligibility,  and  footnotes  results  were  similar.    Probably 
her advisors said the results were redundant and not as clearn.

This paper uses  regression discontinuity  to  identify  the effects of  the CalGrant program  in California.  
Eligibility  of  these  grants  required  students  to meet minimum  thresholds,  one was  for GPA.   No  one 
knew  the GPA  threshold when  they applied.   Kane uses data from all people that applied to examine 
whether  there  was  a  discontinuous  change  in  college  enrolment  at  the  point  of  the  GPA  threshold.  
(show  table).    Note,  this  evidence  does  not  test  whether  credit  constraints  exist  –  only  tries  to 
examine effectiveness in program in raising enrolment.   
 
Could apply, but didn’t know GPA threshold.  Those with GPA’s around the threshold would not have 
had a good sense of whether they would get the scholarship or not.
