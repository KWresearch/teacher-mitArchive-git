1 Economic models of discrimination

An enormous literature, starting with Becker’s 1957 book The Economics of Discrimination,

explores the economics of discrimination. Economic models of discrimination can be divided

into two classes: competitive and collective models. Competitive models study individual max-

imizing behavior that may include discrimination. In collective models, groups acts collectively

against each other. Almost all economic analysis has focused on competitive models, and we’ll

do similarly here. Competitive models can further be divided into taste-based and statistical

models of discrimination. Becker’s’ model studied the former case, and we’ll start with that.

First, we need to deﬁne discrimination. For our purposes, discrimination is when members

of a minority are treated diﬀerently (less favorably) than members of a ma jority group with

identical productive characteristics. Let the wage Y be equal to

Y = X β + αZ + e,

(1)

where X is a vector of exogenous productivity characteristics and Z is an indicator variable

for membership in a minority group. Assuming that X β fully captures the set of productive

characteristics and their returns and/or Z is uncorrelated with e, then discrimination is a case

where α < 0.

We already face diﬃculties just using this simple deﬁnition.

1. ‘Productivity’ may directly depend on Z — for example, in the entertainment industry

or a market in which customers value Z in workers (e.g., discriminating customers). If

customers will pay more to see a white actress or a black athlete, is this a legitimate

component of productivity?

2. There is also a question of whether β — the production technology — is truly exogenous.

For example, ﬁre ﬁghting equipment requires considerable physical strength and zie to

operate, an argument against the entry of women should not enter this profession. But

these requirements are engineered attribute and probably could be altered. If humans

were 20% less physically strong, presumably we could still ﬁght ﬁres. It’s likely that in

Japan, ﬁre-ﬁghting equipment demands a smaller physical stature.

2

3. The X 0s could also be endogenous. Pre-market discrimination — or expectations of future
discrimination — could reduce X 0s for members of the minority group. (Examples: poor
schools, or a rational belief among minorities that education will not be rewarded by the

market.)

Point (1) is one we may be able to examine directly. Point (2) and (3) are much harder to

test. But whether or not these are relevant, it can still be the case that α < 0 conditional on

both X and β , which would constitute discrimination.

2 Taste-based discrimination

Becker’s 1957 book introduced the ﬁrst economic model of discrimination. In this model, em-

ployers hold a ‘taste for discrimination,’ meaning that there is a disamenity value to employing

minority workers. Hence, minority workers may have to ‘compensate’ employers by being more

productive at a given wage or, equivalently, by accepting a lower wage for identical productivity.

The basic insights of this model require almost no formalization, but we will formalize slightly.

• Let A denote ma jority group membership and B denote minority group membership.
• Employers will maximize a utility function that is the sum of proﬁts plus the monetary
value of utility from employing members of particular groups.

• Let d be the taste parameter of the ﬁrm, which Becker called the “coeﬃcient of discrimi-
nation.”

• Firms will maximize

U = pF (Nb + Na) − waNa − wbNb − dNb ,
where p is the price level, F is the production function, Nx is the number of workers of
group x = {a, b}, and wx is the wage paid to members of each group.
• Employers who are prejudiced (d > 0) will act as if the wage of b group members is wb + d.
Hence, they will only hire b group members if

wa − wb ≥ d.
3

• Let G (d) denote the CDF of the prejudice parameter d in the population of employers.
• The optimal number of workers hired at each ﬁrm is determined by the solutions to
pF 0 (Na) = wa ,

pF 0 (Nb ) = wb + d.

• Treating p as ﬁxed and aggregating across ﬁrms in the economy leads to the market
b (wa , wb , G (d)) for each worker type. Wages are
demand functions N d
a (wa , wb , G (d)) , N d

determined by

a (wa , wb , G (d)) = N s
N d
a (wa),

a (wa , wb , G (d)) = N s
N d
a (wd ),

where N s (·) are the supply functions for the worker types.
• Notice the main point that comes out of this setup is this: A wage diﬀerential wb < wa
will arise if and only if the fraction of discriminating employers (or discriminating jobs)

is suﬃciently large that the demand for B workers when wb = wa is less than the supply.

• In other words, discrimination on average does not mean discrimination at the margin.
If there are enough non-discriminating employers, then discrimination is competed away.

This also implies that minority workers don’t work for discriminating employers.

• If the share of prejudice employers is suﬃciently large, then some b group members will
work at d > 0 employers, and this implies that wb < wa . In this case, the strength of
prejudice at the margin (that is d for the marginal employer of b workers) is what aﬀects

determines the size of the wage gap.

• With free entry or constant returns to scale (CRS), these employers may be competed out
of business. In a competitive market, each worker must earn his marginal product. Under

CRS, non-discriminating ﬁrms would simply expand to arbitrage the wage diﬀerential

born by minority workers. In equilibrium, discriminating employers must fund the cost

4

of their distaste out of their own pockets; they cannot past the cost onto the minority

worker.

So, to summarize:

• In partial equilibrium, minority workers must ‘compensate’ employers by being more
productive at a given wage or, equivalently, accepting a lower wage for equivalent pro-

ductivity.

• These tastes create incentives for segregation.
minority workers to work in their own businesses and similarly for ma jority workers —

It is potentially Pareto improving for

then no one bears the cost of the distaste.

• In general equilibrium, these tastes can only be indulged at a positive cost to the employer.
Key testable implications of this model are:

• Wage diﬀerentials: Minority workers earn less than ma jority workers of identical produc-
tivity.

• Preferential hiring: Employers are less likely to hire minority workers of identical produc-
tivity.

• But these implications may not apply in equilibrium at the margin — so it’s not clear that
we should observe them.

Is it a necessary implication of this model that ﬁrms employing minority workers have higher

productivity? Not necessarily.

• Must distinguish: Discrimination at the margin from mean diﬀerences.
• Let’s say minorities are on average less productive than ma jority workers, and employ-
ers engage in taste-based discrimination. Then the marginal minority hire is underpaid

relative to a ma jority hire, but it could still be the case that productivity is higher at

non-minority workplaces.

5

• However, proﬁtability — that is output minus wages paid to factors — should be higher at
ﬁrms with greater minority employment.

• This again assumes that competition is not so ‘strenuous’ that all taste-based discrimi-
nation is eliminated.

2.1 Worker and customer discrimination

• Assume that some members of the a group are prejudiced against b workers and demand
a premium to work alongside them. This is similar to the case above, and leads to

segregation.

• Assume instead that customers discriminate against b workers and so get lower utility
from purchasing services from a ﬁrm if they have to interact with a b worker. This will

lower the labor market return to b workers to working in jobs with customer contact.

• In this case, it is not clear that consumer discrimination will be competed away by the
market. This is because there is not an obvious way for one consumer to arbitrage the

prejudice of another. Yes — consumers who are prejudiced may have to pay higher prices

for goods. But this can be true in equilibrium; customers may be willing to bear these

costs.

• Hence, this model suggests that customer prejudice may actually present a more enduring
source of labor market discrimination than employer prejudice. The intriguing paper by

Holzer and Ihlanfeldt on your syllabus presents evidence on this point. Ashely Lester will

discuss the evidence on customer discrimination in Recitation on Friday.

2.2 Statistical Discrimination

Most economic analyses of discrimination since Phelps (1972) and Arrow (1973) have focused

on the statistical theory of discrimination, rather than taste-based discrimination. The premise

of the statistical discrimination literature is that ﬁrms have limited information about the skills

of job applicants. This gives them an incentive to use easily observable characteristics such

as race or gender to infer the expected productivity of applicants (if these characteristics are

6

correlated with productivity). The Aigner and Cain (1977) article on your syllabus is the classic

reference on this topic.We’ll develop the statistical discrimination model, and then talk about

its implications.

Statistical discrimination is the solution to a signal extraction problem.

If an employer

observes a noisy signal of applicant productivity and also has prior information about correlates

of productivity (let’s say a group-speciﬁc mean), then the expectation of applicant productivity

should place weight on both the signal and the mean. Two cases are commonly exposited,

and we’ll also look at a third. We’ll use normal distributions for simplicity, but this is not

substantively important.

2.2.1 Case 1: Difference in means

• Assume that when workers apply for jobs, the employer sees race of the applicant x =
{a, b} and some error-ridden signal ˜η of productivity.
• Assume that employers have learend from experience that
ηx ∼ N (¯ηx , σ2
η ) with
¯ηa > ¯η b , and σ2
η identical for a and b.

Hence, b group members are less productive on average, but the dispersion of productivity
is the same for both groups. Notice that we can write η i = ηx + εi .

• The productivity signal is error ridden in the following sense:
˜η i = η i + ιi where
ι ), with σ2
ι ∼ N (0, σ2
ι > 0.

Hence:

˜η i = ¯ηx + εi + ιi ,
and E (˜η i |η i) = η i , meaning that the signal is unbiased.
• What is the expectation of η given ˜η and x? This is simply the regression equation,
E (η |eη , x) = ηx (1 − γ ) + eηγ ,
= ηx + (eη − ηx ) γ .
7

(2)

ι / ¡σ2
ι ¢, which is the coeﬃcient from a bivariate regression of η on ˜η
where γ = σ2
η + σ2
and a constant (estimated seperately by group). Note that γ a = γ b in this example; all
that diﬀers is that ¯ηa > ¯η b .

• This equation immediately implies that the for a given ˜η , the expected productivity of b
applicants is below a applicants — even though ˜η is an unbiased signal for both workers.

In particular

E (η |eη = k , x = a) − E (η |eη = k , x = b) = (ηa − η b ) × (1 − γ ) .
This expression will always be positive provided that σ2
i > 0. (Draw yourself a picture.)
Two key points

• Notice the main insight/paradox of statistical discrimination:

E (˜η i |η i , x) = η i
but E (η i |˜η i , x)
6= η i (unless ˜η i = ¯ηx ).

• Is there equal pay for equal productivity in this model? No, not in general. There is equal
pay for equal expected productivity.

• Consider an a and b group worker who both have productivity η = k . So, E (˜η i |η i , x) = k
for both workers. But, using equation (2), it is clear that E (η |˜η i = k , x = b) < E (η |˜η i =
k , x = a).

• Hence, for some workers, statistical discrimination is ‘discrimination’ in the sense of equa-
tion (1).

• But this will not be true on average within each group; expected productivity equals true
productivity on average. Be certain that you are clear on this point.

8

2.2.2 Case 2: Different variances

• Now take a case where ¯η b = ¯ηa and σ2
η . So, the groups are identical in
ηb = σ2
ηa = σ2

• But consider that the signal ˜η may be more informative for one group or another. This
would arise if for example a group managers were inaccurate judges of b group ability (or
you could assume the reverse). This means that σ2

ιa 6= σ2

• It follows that γ a 6= γ b since

γ x =

η

η

.

• For whichever group has lower σ2
ιx , ˜η will be more informative; employers will put less
weight on the mean for this group and more weight on the signal. See Figures 1a and 1b

of Cain and Aigner.

• Depending on whether you are above or below the mean of your group, you are diﬀeren-
tially helped or harmed by a steeper γ x . If you are above the mean, you want the signal
to be as informative as possible. If you are below the mean, you prefer an uninformative

signal.

• Contrasting groups a and b as is done in the Cain and Aigner ﬁgures, you will see that
the expectation of η given ˜η will cross at ¯η for the two groups, and the relative steepness

2.2.3 Case 3: Risk averse employers

• Cain and Aigner also discuss a third plausible case that is rarely examined in the literature:
Employer risk aversion.

• Here, there are diminishing returns to worker ability. Perhaps bad workers tend to destroy
machines by accident, but really good workers are only slightly more productive operatives

than average workers.

2.2.4 Testing statistical discrimination

It’s diﬃcult to test statistical discrimination because it may be impossible to observe how

employers form expectations. Almost any observed racial/gender diﬀerence in pay or hiring

can be attributed to statistical discrimination (which is a problem for the theory, not a virtue).

Almost all tests of statistical discrimination are therefore indirect. We’ll talk about these in

the ‘Evidence’ lecture.

2.2.5 Statistical discrimination: Efficiency, Legality, Fairness,

Eﬃciency It’s interesting to speculate on why economists have focused so much more atten-

tion on statistical than taste-based discrimination. My guesses:

1. The Becker model employs a modeling trick that many economists consider the last refuge

of scoundrels — adding arguments to the utility function. This is a pretty undisciplined

technique. By changing the utility maximand, you can pretty much get whatever you

want. Arguably, however, it is also the most natural approach here. Casual empiricism

says that much prejudice takes the form of ‘distaste.’

10

2. Unlike taste-based discrimination, statistical discrimination is not competed away in equi-

librium. So, we can be reasonably conﬁdent that we should be able to ﬁnd it in a general

set of cases.

3. Closely related to (2), statistical discrimination is ‘eﬃcient.’ That is, statistical discrim-

ination is the optimal solution to an information extraction problem. Economists would

generally say that employers ‘should’ statistically discriminate. It is proﬁt-maximizing, it

is not motivated by animus, and it is arguably ‘fair’ since it treats people with the same

expected productivity identically (though not necessarily with the same actual produc-

tivity). Hence, many economists might endorse statistical discrimination as good public

policy.

Legality That said, statistical discrimination is generally unlawful. It is illegal in the U.S.

to make hiring, pay or promotion decisions based on predicted performance where predictions

are based on race, sex, age or disability. Because minorities, women, those over age 40, and the

disabled are ‘protected groups,’ employers are not permitted to hire and ﬁre them ‘at will.’ (An

employer presumably can statistically discriminate among non-disabled, white males under age

40.) Statistical discrimination is probably diﬃcult to detect, however, and so it is plausible

that despite the law, it occurs frequently.

Fairness Leaving aside legality, it is worth asking whether statistical discrimination accords

with most commons notions of fairness. Here it’s useful to take a loaded example: racial

proﬁling. Say you are the New Jersey State Police, and there are some number of drug runners

who travel on your highways. You have a limited amount of resources to expend on stopping

cars, so you want to maximize your productive resources.

• Let’s go back to statistical discrimination Case 1: Diﬀerence in means. We are going to
recast η as a latent index of criminality.

• Assume that when police oﬃcers observe cars on the highway, they see the race of the
driver x = {a, b} and some error-ridden signal ˜η , corresponding to a latent index that
that the driver is running drugs. For simplicity, deﬁne this assessment on the real line

11

˜η ∈ [−∞, ∞]. A lower value of ˜η corresponds to a lower likelihood, and a higher value to
a higher likelihood. (If you like, you can map these latent index values, ˜η , into the CDF

of the normal to get probabilities.)

• Assume that experience has taught the police that
ηx ∼ N (¯ηx , σ2
η ) with
¯ηa < ¯η b , and σ2
η identical for a and b.

b group members are more likely to be running drugs, though the variance of the latent
index is the same for both groups. As above, η i |xi can be written as η i = ηx + εi .
• The signal for any given car/driver is error ridden.
˜η i = η i + ιi where
ι ), with σ2
ι ∼ N (0, σ2
ι > 0,

which is noisy but unbiased.

• How should the police allocate enforcement resources? The optimal decision rule will
involve a threshold value of η∗ . Police will stop cars with E (η) ≥ η ∗ . One can formalize
this rule with a tiny search model, but I will not. The key point is that the police would

ideally like to stop only the highest probability cars. But waiting has an opportunity
cost, so it would be foolish to await only for cars with ˜η i → ∞. Hence, the optimal
decision rule will choose some η ∗ cutoﬀ lower than ∞: Stop any car that meets a critical
value η∗ . The threshold depends on the distribution of η , the arrival rate of cars, and
the opportunity cost of waiting. We’ll assume (with justiﬁcation) that η∗ will exist, and,
with somewhat less justiﬁcation, that the New Jersey State Police can solve for it.

• Assume that η∗ > ¯ηa , ¯η b. Hence, only a minority of cars from either group should be
stopped.

• Since the police do not observe η for any car, they must form an expectation for this
value. Using the equations above, the expected value of η given ˜η and x is:

E (η |eη , x) = ηx + (eη − ηx ) ¡σ2

• The variance of the expectation of η given x is the variance of true productivity minus
estimation error. Deﬁne ν = ε − e. We have,
η − σ2
e − 2Cov (ε, e) = σ2
η + σ2
V (E (η |eη , x)) = V (ν ) = σ2
e .
This expression underscores a crucial point. So long as σ2
ι > 0 (the signal is error-ridden),
the expectation of η given eη , x has lower variance than η . Therefore, this estimate ‘shrinks’
the true range of the underlying variable. (Draw a picture.)
• This is the essence of ‘racial proﬁling.’ Since the police know from experience that group
b members are more likely to be running drugs than group a members, it is eﬃcient to

use this information in determining which cars to stop. You can demonstrate that this is

eﬃcient by conﬁrming that the marginal η stopped is the same for both a and b. In fact,

this is the decision rule.

• Note that for an individual with a ιi = 0, xi = x, the police will necessarily under- or
overestimate her true criminality unless η i is equal to the group speciﬁc mean ¯ηx .

• Two important points follow from this rule.
1. The share of b cars stopped exceeds the share of a cars stopped. This can be seen

as follows:

where Φ (·) is the cumulative density function of the standard normal distribution,
and the quantity in parentheses (η∗ − ¯ηx ) /σν is the ‘eﬀective screening threshold’
for group x. This quantity is the standardized diﬀerence between the group’s mean

and the threshold, scaled by screening precision. The lower is screening precision,

the smaller is σν , and the larger is the eﬀective screening threshold.

— Diﬀerentiating (4) with respect to the group mean gives

∂ Pr(Stop|x)/∂ ¯ηx = (1/σν ) φ µ η ∗ − ¯ηx
where φ (·) is the pdf of the standard normal distribution. Since φ (·) > 0, a
higher value of ¯ηx implies greater odds of being stopped.
— So, drivers from the b group are stopped more often.

2. The average η of b cars stopped exceeds that of a cars stopped. In other words, the

level of criminality (or the fraction of criminals) is higher among stopped b cars. You

can see this as follows:

— Diﬀerentiating this expression with respect to ¯ηx gives

∂E (η |Stop, x)/∂ ¯ηx = 1 − λ0 (·) .

14

— Since λ0 (z) < 1 for ﬁnite z , the expected criminality of those stopped is increas-
ing in, ¯ηx , the group mean.
— The reason is that the optimal stopping rule equates the marginal return to

stopping an a versus b driver. Because there is more mass to the right of η∗ for
the b group, this means that the average criminality of stopped b drivers will be

higher than a drivers .

• Most economists would view this stopping rule as ‘fair.’
— The marginal car stopped has the same expected criminality for both groups.

— There is no animus motivating these choices (i.e., taste-based discrimination).

— Moreover, the average criminality is actually higher among the b group than the a

group, despite the higher frequency of stops of b members.

— Resources are eﬃciently deployed.

• So, why do civil libertarians complain? And why do b group members get upset about
being stopped for “DWB” (‘Driving While Black’)?

• One possible answer is that well-intended liberals don’t understand basic statistical prin-
ciples.

• Another answer is that this system will seem demonstrably unfair to group b members
who are not criminals.

• Consider two citizens, one from group a, the other from group b, who have the same
η = k . Assume that k < η ∗ , so neither ‘should’ be stopped. What is the likelihood that
each is stopped?

15

• Notice that the expectation of the left-hand side of this expression is identical for both a
and b since η = k . But the right-hand side is not. Because the eﬀective screening treshold
is declining in the group’s mean ¯ηx , the b group driver with η = k is more likely to be
stopped than the a group driver η = k .

• Another way to see this: For any true level of criminality k , E (˜η |η = k , x = a) = E (˜η |η = k , x = b)
is identical for a and b. But E (η |˜η = k , x = b) > E (η |˜η = k , x = a): the police will not
treat these individuals identically. The b driver is more likely to be viewed as a criminal.

• Substantive point: Although racial proﬁling is an eﬃcient way to apprehend criminals, it
does impose a cost on all group b members, including the innocent. There are more Type

I errors for group b, i.e., more innocent motorists stopped. If you are a b group member,

that may seem patently unfair.

• Though this is rarely discussed, statistical discrimination does pose an equity-eﬃciency
trade-oﬀ.

• This may explain why economic and lay intuitions on the virtues of statistical discrimi-
nation are typically at odds: I suspect that most economists might favor statistical dis-

crimination as policy, but it is illegal.

• One possible contibutor to this discrepancy: Economists may not generally recognize that
statistical discrimination is inequitable on average, even if it is ‘fair’ at the margin.

• Another point of this example: Many important economic decisions are up/down, yes/no
decisions (stop or not, hire or not, promote or not). In these cases, the crucial choice

variable is whether some expectation exceeds a critical value, and this can have large
distributional consequences. Imagine for example in our racial proﬁling model that ¯ηa <
η∗ < ¯η b and σ2
i → ∞. That is, the signal ˜η is uninformative and so the decision rule
