Lecture 5: Intertemporal Labor Supply 
 
Labor  supply  is  clearly  part  of  a  lifetime  decision  making  process.    There  are  some 
obvious,  but  important  stylized  facts  about  the  pattern  of wages  and  employment  over  the 
lifecycle: 
 
1) Earnings and wages rise with age after schooling, then decline before retirement. 
 
2) Hours worked generally rises with age,  then  falls before retirement,  then goes  to zero at 
retirement. 
 
3) Individuals have been retiring earlier, on average, over the last 20 years 
 
4) female labor supply has increased dramatically in the last 40 years. 
 
Variations  in  health  status,  family  composition  and  real  wages  –  anticipated  or  otherwise, 
provide  incentives  for  individuals  to  vary  the  timing  of  their  labor  market  earnings  for 
income-smoothing  and  taste  purposes.   But  these  responses  are  not  adequately  captured 
in  the  static model.    Let me  just  emphasize  here  that  this  does  not make  the  static model 
useless.    Indeed,  I  think  the  static model  is  far more  helpful  in  thinking  about  labor  supply 
issues than the intertemporal model. 
 
The intertemporal model of labor supply makes the point that there are three types of wage 
shocks:  permanent,  transitory,  and  anticipated,  and  the  supply  response  (elasticity)  will 
depend  on  what  type  of  shock  occurs.    We  must  be  clear  what  type  of  shock  we  are 
examining when interpreting empirical results that measure the response. 
 
My  take  on  this  model  is  that  it  is  not  very  testable,  and  there  are  a  lot  of  assumptions 
required to estimate the different types of shocks.  Furthermore, the intertemporal model of 
requires the assumption of time seperability – a dubious assumption.

β    is  a  time  preference  factor.    Note:  already  we’ve  assumed  lifetime  utility  is  time 
separable:  leisure  taken  in  one  period  does  not  affect  the  utility  in  another  period.    This  is 
not a  realistic assumption,  since clearly human capital decisions when young affect wages 
(price  of  leisure),  and  therefore  utility  in  other  periods.    You  might  prefer  to  think  of  this 
model beginning after  school,  since  it will have problems explaining  labor supply decisions 
driven by education reasons separable by time period, rather than period t utility dependent 
on next period’s consumption or leisure. 
 
Borrowing  and  lending  is  permitted,  and  so  the  budget  constraint  essentially  summarizes 
the  time path of wealth  (or assets).   Note, we’ve assumed non-labor  income  is zero.   Let’s 
also assume an interior solution, so L<T always.   
 
The  model  is  a  bit  more  involved  to  solve  with  uncertainly,  but  be  need  uncertainty  to 
derive the more interesting implications.  There are several ways to solve.  Here’s one.   
 
Define  expected  wealth  in  period  t,

We use the Bellman equation to solve the dynamic programming problem.  The approach 
is to consider the maximization problem into two parts.  From the standpoint of date t, an 
individual must maximize lifetime utility in date t+1 subject to the future wealth level 
produced by today’s consumption and leisure decisions (If not, the individual could raise

These  are  called  the  Frisch  demand  functions.    Whereas  the  marshallian  function  holds 
income  constant  and  hicksian  function  hold  utility  constant,  frisch  functions  hold  the 
marginal utility of wealth constant.

What’s  interesting  is  that  current  period  labor  supply  can  be  decomposed  into  only  3 
components:  X,  w,  and  lamda,  which  summarizes  the  relevant  information  from  all  other 
periods.    Variables  such  as  future  wealth,  wages,  or  personal  characteristics  affect 
consumption and labor supply decisions only by changing the value of lambda.

The  change  in  labor  supply  consists  of  a  component  due  variation  in  wages,  differences 
between  real  interest  rate and  time preference, and  component due  to any updating  in  log 
of marginal utility of wealth. 
 
In  stochastic  environment,  response  of  individual  hours  to  observed  change  in wages  has 
twlog∆η
,  as  in  the  perfect  foresight  model.  The  second  is  the 
two  parts  –  the  first  is 
change  in  labor  supply  generated  by  the  change  in  the  marginal  utility  of  wealth.    The 
realization  of  wages  provides  new  information  that  generates  an  update  in  the  distribution 
of  future wages and brings about a  revision  in  the  forecast of  lambda.   Unfortunately  there 
tλ  in  an  uncertain  environment.  Thus,  the  component 
are  no  closed  form  expressions  for 
of  the  change  in  labor  supply  attributable  to  wealth  effects  is  usually  treated  as  a 
‘nuisance’, and is eliminated by an instrumental variables procedure.

When  estimating  labour  supply  effect,  need  to  be  clear  what  type  of  variation  we  are

But  looking  at  changes  in  log  labor  supply  requires  positive  hours worked  in  both  periods.  
Some studies restricted to looking at prime age males: not very interesting.

In general, we need instrument for wages, or exogenous variation in wages where we know 
what type of wage variation occurs.

to  precisely  which  controls  one  includes  in  the  vector  Q  and  which  of  these  controls  are 
treated as exogenous.

But,  if  consumers  adjust  behaviour  to  account  for  factors  in  future  periods,  the  coefficient 
on  log  wage  lacks  economic  meaning:  no  matter  what  econometric  methods  are  applied.  
That  is,  if  the  labor  supply  decision  has  any  lifecycle  elements,  static  regressions  confuse 
shifts of wage profiles with movements along wage profiles and  thus yield parameters  that 
lack economic interpretation.

1β  is  intertemporal  substitution  elasticity,  which  holds  marginal  utility  of  wealth  constant, 
and  describes  how  changes  in  wages  induced  by  movements  along  an  indivudal’s  wage 
profile  influence hours of work.      Individuals  fully anticipate  these  changes, and  this  is why 
wealth remains fixed.  This is evolutional wage changes we are looking at. 
 
To  look  at  unanticipated  shifts  of  individual  wage  profiles,  must  complete  model  and 
provide empirical specification of evolution of wages. 
 
Generally, to do this, anticipate wage profile using average profiles of individuals in group:

So looking at deviations around this. 
 
Most  appropriate  elasticity  to  examine  for  policy  evaluation,  since  most  tax  and  benefit 
reforms  like  once-and-for-all  unanticipated  shifts  in  net-of-tax  real  wages  today  and  in  the 
future. 
 
Note,  if  preferences  equal  interest  rate, only  taste  shifters or unanticipated  shocks  change 
labor supply.

Criticisms with this model: 
 
See  Card’s  critique:  model  doesn’t  hold  up  well  when  looking  at  the  data  and  comparing 
model’s implications. (But see Heckman for a defense of Card’s critique). 
 
Time separation assumption seems unlikely. 
 
Liquidity constraints also may limit usefulness of these models. 
 
Model  ignores  training/firm  relationships  that  see  wages  changing  over  tenure  (e.g. 
unions). 
 
Many assumptions required to estimate all relevant parameters. 
 
We’ve  simplified  to  look  at  interior  solutions,  but most  of  action  seems  to  be  coming  from 
whether individuals work or don’t (see Heckman).
