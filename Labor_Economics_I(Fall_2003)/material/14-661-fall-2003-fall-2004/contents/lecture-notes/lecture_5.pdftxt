1 Introduction

So far, we have toyed with issues of contracting in our discussions of training (both general

and speciﬁc), holdup and shirking. The goal of this lecture is to make this set of issues more

precise. We’ll take three cuts at the contracting problem

1. The canonical Principal-Agent problem, which formalizes the trade-oﬀ between risk and

incentives (review). This model is about uncertainty of outcomes with no uncertainty

about appropriate actions.

2. The Principal-Agent problem with uncertainty about appropriate actions and asymmetric

information (Baker, 1992).

3. The Principal-Agent problem with uncertainty about appropriate actions and asymmetric

information: the choice of input- versus output-based contracts (Prendergast, 2002)

2 Canonical Principal-Agent problem

• An optimal compensation scheme must accomplish two things:
1. Induce a given worker to put forth the appropriate level of eﬀort (incentive compat-

ible)

2. Induce the ‘right workers’ to accept the contract (selection, individual rationality)\
• Under risk neutrality, the optimal contract is linear.

w = α + β q ,

where w is the wage, q is output, and α, β are chosen contracting parameters.

• Output depends on eﬀort and luck. Normalize eﬀort e so that one unit of eﬀort produces
one unit of output in expectation,

where ν is luck or measurement error.

q = e + ν ,

2

• Workers cost of eﬀort is c (e), with c0 (·) , c00 (·) > 0.
• Worker’s labor supply function is

max
e

E [α + β (e + ν ) − c (e)] ,

with FOC

• Firm’s problem is therefore

c0 (e) = β .

E (q) − (α + β e) = max

= 0

(2)

• Combining (1) with (2) implies that β ∗ = 1. The ﬁrm pays the worker the entire residual
proﬁt. Given this, the optimal α — which is generally negative — is chosen to satisfy the

IR constraint.

• Hence, ﬁrm rents the worker the job at price α, and pays piece rate 1.
• However, if the worker is risk averse, then this result must be modiﬁed: There is now a
trade-oﬀ between incentives and risk:

— A ﬂat rate contract where w = E [α + β (e + ν ) − c (e)] provides the best insurance
and the worst incentives

3

— A pure piece rate contract with w = α + q provides the best incentives and worst

insurance

• For any concave utility function, we’ll therefore have 0 ≤ βRA < β RN = 1, where RA and
RN stand for Risk Averse and Risk Neutral respectively, where BRA is declining in the
agent’s risk aversion (and α will therefore be increasing).

• The only “agency problem” in this setup is that a ﬁrm cannot simultaneously provide
eﬃcient incentives and eﬃcient insurance to a risk averse agent.

• The important comparative static in this model is that, holding agent risk aversion con-
ν ), the lower is βRA . Although risk has
stant, the ‘riskier’ is the environment (greater σ2
no eﬀect on the optimal β for a risk neutral party, higher risk makes the contract less

attractive to a risk averse agent, and the ﬁrm may have to compensate the agent heavily

(though α) to satisfy the IR.

• Notice that you can think of this trade-oﬀ in terms of input versus output monitoring.
— The extreme case of input monitoring is when you pay the worker if he sits at his

desk, regardless of what he produces.

— The extreme case of output monitoring is that you pay him q , regardless of what he

does.

• The PA model implies that output monitoring is the ideal case for a risk neutral agent.
3 Adding imperfect output monitoring to this model

• It in its canonical form, the PA model takes the problem of incentives as purely a problem
of mitigating the impacts of random noise. This suggests that the problem might be

relatively solvable. For example, if the principal knew the agent’s cost function c (e) and

could monitor eﬀort perfectly, she could write an optimal ‘input contract’ based on the

agent supplying e∗ that solves c (e∗ ) = 1. So, in this simple form, perhaps it’s not such a
deep problem.

4

• In fact, the only distortion in the equilibrium of the PA model is that incentives might
be insuﬃciently ‘strong’ for ﬁrst best output given that agents are risk averse.

• Could a contract be ‘too strong,’ in that it generates too much output? In the PA model,
the answer is no so long as β ≤ 1, which will always be true (and this is a strict inequality
of the agent is risk averse).

• But intuition — and many colorful examples — suggest that the answer must be yes. See
for example the ﬁgure from Oyer, 1999, QJE on quarterly sales at competing Tandem

and Stratus computer companies. Even though their ﬁscal years end in diﬀerent quarters,

each has large sales jumps at end of ﬁscal year. Clearly, this is not business cyclicality.

Most likely explanation: gaming by managers.

• This idea was ﬁrst formally articulated in a management journal article by Steven Kerr,
1975, “On the Folly of Rewarding A, While Hoping for B.” At the time of its publication,

economists did not have a language for Kerr’s idea. Baker’s 1992 JPE formalizes Kerr’s

insight.

3.1 Sketch:

• There are numerous tasks that the agent could engage in at any time.
• These tasks, in aggregate aﬀect the thing that the principle wishes to maximize V (e, (cid:18)).
• Which activities will have the highest marginal product is unknown ex ante (a random
variable, function of (cid:18)).

• But these values are observed privately by the agent at the time of production.
• This would not create an incentive problem except that a contract cannot be written for
V (e, (cid:18)).

• Instead, a contract must be written for P (e, (cid:18)), which is observable/veriﬁable.

5

• [Why? We can only reward what we can measure. We cannot measure ‘maximizing
shareholder value.’ We can measure ‘burgers ﬂipper per hour.’ So, that’s what you will

paid for.]

• This disjuncture between V (e, (cid:18)) , P (e, (cid:18)) gives rise to a set of contracts that can be either
too weak or too strong, even with risk neutral agents.

• [Note that if we assumed there was no private information, this would be equivalent to
assuming that the principal could contract directly over V (e, (cid:18)), since would be able to

specify optimal eﬀorts given the opportunity set.]

3.2 Setup in full

• P’s ob jective f ’n V (e, (cid:18)) is not contractible.
• It is a f ’n of e, agent’s actions, and (cid:18), a set of random variables that completely characterize
the state of the world (‘SOW ’).

• Assume an arbitrary contractible performance measure P (e, (cid:18)), which is also a f ’n of e
and SOW .

• Assume risk neutrality — complicates without added insight. Key point is that we may
get β < 1 despite risk neutrality.

• Consider only linear incentive contracts:

w = α + βP (e, (cid:18))

(3)

• Neither P nor A knows (cid:18) before signing contract.
• Information: Agent is asymmetrically well informed about (cid:18) when actions are to be
performed, and this aﬀects her optimal action choice. (Seems sensible: Agent directly

observes opportunity set at time actions must be taken; Principal is on a lounge chair

gazing out at the Caribbean sea.)

• This setup implies that eﬀort is a random variable, a function of (cid:18).
6

• Non-triviality: At least some elements of (cid:18) aﬀect marginal product of eﬀort on both
V (·) , P (·) .
• Contracts are binding — cannot be reneged (otherwise IR constraint also random)
• The standard deviation of Ve (the marginal product of eﬀort) with respect to (cid:18), deﬁned as
σve is a measure of the amount of valuable information that the agent possesses. When
σve low, variations in opportunity set observed by agent are not particularly important
for the principal’s ob jectives. And v.v. when σve high. Be clear: marginal product of
eﬀort could be high or low in either cases, but if σve is low, there is little reason to vary
eﬀort.

• Similarly σpe is a measure of valuable info A has about performance measure P (·) .
• Consider e as a unidimensional variable, although could be written as vector.
• Time line:
1. Agent signs binding contact specifying P (·) , α, β .
2. (cid:18) is unknown, but its distribution is known

3. After signing, before choice of e, all elements of (cid:18) revealed to agent.

3.3 Maximization

• Normalize P (·) so that the average dollar value of an incremental unit of performance
measure is 1. Hence, optimal piece rate is 1 under a ﬁrst-best contract:

E [Pe (e, (cid:18))] = E [Ve (e, (cid:18))] .

(4)

The expected marginal product of eﬀort on performance measure equal to expected mar-

ginal product of eﬀort on value.

• Standard assumptions on eﬀort cost: c0 > 0, c00 > 0.

w = α + βP (e, (cid:18)) − c(e).

• Substituting the IR constraint into the maxmization gives
E [V (e∗ , (cid:18)) − H + βP (e, (cid:18)) − c(e) − βP (e, (cid:18))] ,
and diﬀerentiating WRT β yields
E £Vee∗β ¤ − E £c0 (e)e∗β ¤ = 0,

where e∗β = ∂ e∗/∂β .

• Substituting in equation (7) for c0 (e∗ ) and rearranging yields β ∗ ,
E £Vee∗β ¤
E £Pee∗β ¤ .
Notice that if there were no random variables involved — that is optimal eﬀort is not a
function of (cid:18) — then β ∗ = 1, and there is no contracting problem.

β ∗ =

• Now, substitute back into (9) to get

β ∗ =

E hVe ³ Pe
c00−βPee ´i
E hPe ³ Pe
c00−βPee ´i .
Assuming (c00 − βPee ) is constant (‘2nd order Taylor approximation’) reduces this to
E [VePe ]
β ∗ =

E [P 2

• Assume WLOG that E [Pe ] = E [Ve ] = 1 at e∗ and recalling that E [A · B ] = E [A] ·
E [B ] + cov(A, B ), we can write

β ∗ =

1 + cov(Ve , Pe )
1 + var(Pe )

.

The correlation coeﬃcient between two variables a, b is deﬁned as

ρab =

σab
σaσb

(12)

(13)

Using this, we can rewrite as (12)
σve σpe ¶ σve σpe + 1
β ∗ = µ σve pe
1 + σ2
pe
• This the coeﬃcient from a bivariate regression without an intercept...
• Key observations
1. If σve = σpe and ρ = 1, then β ∗ = 1.That is, if Ve , Pe are perfectly correlated with
identical variances, then we are back in the ﬁrst-best world. (Measures don’t need

ρσve σpe + 1
1 + σ2
pe

(14)

=

.

to be identical for this to be true, just proportional.)

2. Correlation of Ve , Pe is a key determinant of optimal piece rate.
product of eﬀort on a performance measure is strongly correlated with the marginal

If the marginal

product of eﬀort on value, then the agent, who chooses eﬀort level based on the value

of Pe , will choose high levels of eﬀort when Ve is high and low levels when Ve low.

3. The piece rate β serves two functions:

— One is to get the agent to exert eﬀort on average

9

— Two is to get the agent to use her superior information in choosing her eﬀort

level.

4. This means that the piece rate can still be positive even when Ve , Pe are negatively
correlated (so long as the marginal product of eﬀort is positive on average).

Example, from Baker: 2 states of world, equally likely. In one state, Pe = 5, Ve = 10
and in the other Pe = 10, Ve = 5. So, the measures are perfectly negative correlated.
Would you want β < 0 in this case? No, because you still want positive eﬀort on

average. Marginal products are 7.5 on average, and optimal piece rate is 0.8.

• Comparison with standard PA model:
— If A risk neutral, there is no conﬂict of interest between P and A; ﬁrst best achievable.

— Here, a conﬂict of interest arises — even with risk neutrality — because the piece rate

does not perfectly align A’s incentives with P’s ob jectives (unless the correlation is

one).

— So, even risk neutral agent facing a β of 1 could be induced to work too hard if the

marginal value of eﬀort for P is lower than the marginal value of eﬀort for V . This

would be ineﬃciently costly for the agent and principal. (Note that if c00 = 0, this
would not be true. Convexity of eﬀort function means that marginal cost of eﬀort

eventually rises faster than marginal product.)

— Trade-oﬀ: the Principal will reduce eﬀort variation by reducing piece rate — reduces

incentives for eﬀort but this is eﬃcient.

3.4 Observable effort case

• When eﬀort is observable, Principal could condition the agent’s payoﬀ on her eﬀort choice.
• In the standard PA model, this would be ﬁrst best eﬃcient.
If the Principal exerted
ﬁrst-best eﬀort and this could be veriﬁed, pay could be independent of actual output —

could oﬀer full insurance and full incentives. So, an input contract with monitoring solves

incentive and participation constraint perfectly.

10

• In the Baker model, that result will not hold. Because of the information asymmetry, the
Principal still will not know the optimal level of eﬀort because does not observe realization

of (cid:18). Can still reward e on average if observable, however.

• Consider this contract

w = α + β 1E [P |e] + β s (P − E [P |e]) .
This contract pays two separate piece rates: one for expected output conditional on eﬀort,

(15)

the other for the realization of output. Each piece rate serves a purpose.

1. β 1 causes the principal to exert the right level of eﬀort on average

2. β 2 provides incentives to adjust eﬀort level according to superior information about
marginal productivity (due to observation of (cid:18)).

• Optimal solutions for these parameters is
β ∗1 =

E [Ve ]
E [Pe ]
σve pe
σve
σve pe
σve
σve σpe ·
σ2
σpe
σpe
ve
which are the intercept and slope coeﬃcients from a regression of V on P and a constant.

β ∗2 = ρ

= 1,

=

=

,

• So, observing eﬀort allows the principal to improve the contract. (This contract would
produce shirking if eﬀort was not observable.)

• How do we know that this contract is more eﬃcient than (14)?
— In the prior example, we could never have β ∗ < 0, if the marginal product of eﬀort

was positive on average. That’s even true if Ve and Pe are perfectly negatively
correlated.

— In this example, β ∗1 provides incentives for average eﬀort and β ∗2 provides incentives
for marginal eﬀort. So, we could easily have a case where β ∗1 > 0 and β ∗2 < 0. And
if we did, this would dominate the single instrument case where one β must trade

oﬀ between solving these two problems simultaneously.

• This is an insightful and important paper (and elegant).
11

4 Prendergast 2002 JPE

• I will not develop the details of this paper. But it provides another insight into why the
PA model is too parsimonious (and also an empirical failure).

• The contrast here is again between input and output monitoring. Recall from the PA
model that input monitoring is preferred where there is high risk to the risk-averse agent

and output monitoring when there is low risk.

• In the Prendergast model, there is again a large dimensional action space and again
private information observed by the Agent about marginal products. Another key idea:

input monitoring is cheaper than output monitoring. Why would this be true? Seems

that the answer will vary with context.

• Under these assumptions, input monitoring will be preferred by Principal when she has
a clear idea of the right actions to take. This reduces monitoring costs at not a great loss

in eﬃciency.

• Problem: precisely in the ‘riskiest’ settings where Principal does not have good informa-
tion about what actions to take (e.g., sending a sales representative to a foreign country

to develop a new line of business versus siting a McDonalds on the interstate).

• In these uncertain cases, the principal may choose output monitoring so as not to constrain
agents’ superior information about actions. But this will shift risk to agents when risk is

high — opposite of PA model.

• The details of this model are not especially elegant but the point seems good. If you need
references on “order statistics,” please ask me.

5 Conclusion

As this lecture may underscore, the contracting issues we visited in the lectures on training

investment and eﬃciency wage incentives are fairly rudimentary relative to the depth of the

sub ject. As a labor economist, you should understand the fundamentals of incentive and

12

mechanism design, at least at the introductory level here. If you want further depth, I highly

recommend the Organizational Economics and Contract Theory classes taught by Bob Gibbons.
