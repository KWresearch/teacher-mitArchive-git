Labor Demand: Lecture 8 
 
Empirical Evidence of Effects of Immigration, continued 
 
Today we pick up where we left off on our discussion of the effects of immigration on labor supply and 
wages of natives.   Recent  immigration  in  the U.S.  is  concentrated  in  certain occupations, particularly 
low skilled occupations and agricultural work.

Educational Attainment, United States and California.

Note, we have not mentioned immigration in the model yet.  But consider two skill groups: skilled and 
unskilled.    Suppose  immigration  leads  to  an  increase  in  the  population  of  unskilled  labor.    Implicitly, 
this  assumes  immigrants  and  unskilled  natives  are  perfect  substitutes.    To  the  extent  that  this  is  not 
true, the implied increase in the population of unskilled labor is less, and the implied effect is less. 
 
The model predicts a decrease in wages if the elasticity of labor supply or the elasticity of substitution 
are not  infinite  (similar  to  the Johnson model).    Ignoring demand  (as  this model does), an  increase  in 

Philip Oreopoulos Labor Economics Notes for 14.661 Fall 2004-05 Lecture 8 

3 

the unskilled labor allows firms to lower the wage and still hire the same number to produce the same 
output.    How  much  of  a  decrease  depends  on  how  sensitive  the  current  native  workers  are  to  that 
change.   
 
If  unskilled  labor  is  a  substitute  for  other  inputs  in  production,  firms  can  take  advantage  of  lower 
wages  for  unskilled  workers  also  by  substituting  the  use  of  other  inputs  and  using  more  unskilled 
labor.    The  more  unskilled  labor  is  a  substitute  for  other  inputs,  the  more  unskilled  workers 
demanded, putting pressure to drop the wage by less. 
 
Native  unskilled  labor  employment  only  changes  from  immigration  to  the  extent  that  immigration 
affects wages. 
 
 A  number  of  papers  define  j  simply  in  terms  of  2  groups:  skilled  and  unskilled.    The main  empirical 
approach therefore  is  to regress wages and unemployment  levels of unskilled natives at  the city  level 
on the city immigration level: 
 
log
 
(note: most studies switch to using f instead of logf to ease interpretation). 
 
We can’t use city fixed effects because  f    is measured across only one or two skill groups.  Even  if f 
is  the  fraction  of  unskilled  immigrants,  we  can’t  include  the  skilled  worker  observations  becase

 (first difference) 

 
e.g. Altonji and Card (1991), Butcher and Card (1991), LaLonde and Topel (1991), Schoeni (1997). 
 
The main advantage with  the  first difference analysis  is  that  it eliminates bias  from not  including  time 
invariant  city  specific  fixed  effects.    Transitory  effects  (associated  with  transitory  fluctuation  in  the

demand  for  the  output  of  specific  cities  remain).    Altonji  and  Card  suggest  instrumenting  with  the 
initial period level of immigration. 
 
Note,  if  short  and  long  run  differences  exist,  the  first  difference  approach  measures  more  short  run 
effects. 
 
<Altonji and Card, Table 7> 
 
 
The  general  conclusion  with  this  approach  has  been  that  immigration  has  had  little  or  no  significant 
negative effect on native wages and employment. 
 
Main concerns with this approach: 1) the possibility that mobility offsets immigrant inflows 
 
2)  the  possibility  of  remaining  downward  bias  from  local  demand 
 
 
 
 
shocks  
 
Card,  defines  skill  groups  as  occupations.    This  allows  him  to  include  city  fixed  effects  in  the  cross 
sectional  regressions.    Also,  grouping  by  occupation  allows  for  more  specific  labor  supply  increase, 
and may allow more precision in estimation, and more useful variation.

(multi-nomial logit).  X includes race, education, age, marital status, ethnicity, and city. 
 
Use prediction equation  to estimate probability of being  in occupation  j  for entire  sample  (even  those 
not working).  
cjP  is the sum of the probabilities:

Cities  with  more  immigrants,  individuals  with  less  education,  will  have  higher 

cjP   for  low  skill 

occupations. 
 

Finally,  Card  instruments  the  city  occupation  labor  supply,

Philip Oreopoulos Labor Economics Notes for 14.661 Fall 2004-05 Lecture 8

City  specific  variation  in 

jcSP   arises  only  from  a  variable  that  is  measured  before  85.    Thus, 
jcSP   is 
independent of any city specific demand shock between 85 and 90 that would have led to differences 
in immigration composition.

 on 

jcSP  is about 5. 

 
Even  though  the  analysis  is  at  the  occupation/city  level,  the  LATE  is  the  effect  of  wages  and 
employment  from  an  increase  in  the  city-occupation  labor  force  due  to  immigration  between  85  and 
90. 
 
Approach generates more precise results, but conclusion that immigration effects on labor market are 
small remains. 
  
Concern about mobility  remains.   Card  tries  to  address  this by  actually measuring  population  inflows 
and  outflows  of  cities,  in  response  to  city  specific  immigration.    The  census  provides  information  on 
location 5 years ago.  Can use to calculate city-occupation population inflows and outflows.

Borjas  takes  the  mobility  concern  seriously.    He  argues  strong  forces  exist  to  equalize  economic 
conditions across cities.   (Note, see Schoeni who  takes Altonji and Card and adjusts for cost of  living 
by city). 
 
Borjas’ approach is analogous to Card’s, but uses variation by experience and education group rather 
than city, to measure impacts of immigration at the national level. 
 
Output is time specific, rather than city specific:

Eσ   is  the  eslaticity  of

substitution  across  these  education  groups.   Borjas  normalizes  the  skill  augmentation  factors  to  sum 
to one:  
 
Now he goes one step further to allow for workers with same education but different experience not to 
be perfect substitutes:

Borjas uses m = .168, the fraction of immigrants in the labor force in 2000, for the comparison. 
 
Note,  comparison  between  Card  and  Borjas  is  made  difficult  by  Borjas  using  education-experience 
shares, and Card using occupation shares.
