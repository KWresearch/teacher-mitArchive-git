Problem Set 2

You  may  work  in  groups,  but  you  must  do  the  coding  and  write-up  on  your  own.    Include  your  code 
with your writeup.  Do not submit STATA output in raw form. 
 
This problem set provides an introduction and summary to issues related to intergenerational mobility.  The

You  only  have  sons  and  father’s  earnings  data  for  one  year.    Show  that  a  linear  regression  of  annual  sons

3) Assume no serial correlation in log earnings across periods. What is the attenuation bias using an average 
of  father’s  log  earnings  over T  years?   Assuming  the  share  of  the  variance  in  annual earnings  is  accounted 
by  permanent  factors  by  .5,  transitory  factors  by  .3,  and  measurement  error  by  .2,  how  much  is  the  bias 
reduced averaging over 5 years compared to just using one year? What about over 10 years? 
 
Bonus: Assume serial correlation:  
 
w
0
 
What  is  the  attenuation  bias,  and  how much  is  the  attenuation  bias  reduced  by  averaging  over  5  years  and 
8.=ρ   (you  need  to  recall  rules  of  summation  to  do  this).    Ignore  the  fact  that  persistence  in 
10  years  if 
annual  shocks  affects  the  average  lifetime  earnings  if  the  shocks  do  not  die  off  over  the  course  of  an 
individual’s working life. 
 
4) The model  above  assumes  log  earnings  differs  by  level  rather  than  growth.   Everyone  has  the  same  age 
profile, and so we can detrend by age without any concern.  For any given age, the variance in log earnings 
is  the same.   Now consider  the  implications if sons differ in earnings growth.   This  is a natural extension  if 
we believe wage growth differs by initial skill or education level.  To contrast with above, suppose there are 
0 =
y
y
,  and  that  initial  son’s  log 
no  transitory  shocks  and  no measurement  error.   Father’s  earnings  are

Part II 
 
Part II provides a brief example of a regression discontinuity design. 
 
The  dataset  bw_educ_data.dta  contains  cell mean  data  for  all  births  in Texas  and California  between  1989 
and  2001  among mothers  aged  23  years  or  less  (see McCrary  and Royer  for  details).   Data  are  aggregated 
by birth day of mother (365 cells). 
 
Variable definitions 
 
Rel_bdate:  number  of  days  born  before  or  after  the  closest  school  entry  day  cut-off  (December  1st  in 
California, September 1st in Texas). 
Educ_cal: mean years of schooling for mothers from the California sample 
Educ_texas: mean years of schooling for mothers from the texas sample 
Bw_cal: fraction of children born low birth weight from the California sample 
Bw_texas: fraction of children born low birth weight from the texas sample  
 
Children age  6  a  day  before  the  school  entry  law  are  required  to  enter Grade  1, while children  age  6  a day 
after the entry law do not enter Grade 1 until the following school year.  These latter children typically have 
one year less education before having the legal option to drop out of high school.

iy   is  birthweight  of child  from

We  are  interested  in  estimating  the  following model: 
i
i

iS   is  years  of  schooling  for  mother  i.    Suppose  relative  birth  date, 
ix ,  is  small  enough  an 
mother  i,  and 
xi ≤
*x
*x .  Children with 
 enter school 
interval that we can treat it as continuous.  A discontinuity exists at: 
xi >
*x
.   A  child  is  legally  allowed  to  leave  school when  they  turn  16.  
one  year  earlier  than  children with 
*x   
Thus, assuming the existence of left and right limits at 
 
S
 
Around birth dates arbitrarily close to

1) Estimate  the  ‘first  stage’, 
,  by  assuming  schooling  is  a  polynomial  function of date  of  birth and 
xi >
*x
.   Assume  the polynomial  takes on  the same functional form  to  the  left and right of 
an  indicator for 
the discontinuity (you may also consider other functional forms or kernel estimators if you choose).   Graph

the fitted first stage on scatter graph, with 95 percent confidence regions around the predicted fit, and a line 
at the discontinuity. 
 
2) Do the same for the reduced form. 
 
3)  What  is  your  IV-regression  discontinuity  estimate  for  the  effect  of  schooling  on  child’s  birth  weight?  
Interpret this as a LATE. 
 
4)  Why is it useful that we have both Texas and California data? 
 
 
Part III 
 
The  dataset  repeat_educm.dta  contains  observations  from  the  1%  samples  of  the  1960,70,  and  80  U.S. 
Censuses.   The sample  includes all children ages 7  to 15 born in  the United States matched  to mothers also 
born in the United States.      
 
Variable definitions 
 
State: current state of household residence 
Bpl2mom: birth state of mom 
Year14m: year mom was age 14 
Dropagem: minimum school leaving age at state mom was born in, when mom was age 14 
Age: age of child 
Censyear: census year 
Clmom:  predicted  number  of  years mom  required  to  stay  in  school  based  on  state  of  birth,  and  year mom 
was 14 
Agemom: age of mom 
Iwagemom: mom’s wage and salary income 
Higr2mom: mom’s highest grade completed 
Ftotinc: mom’s total family income 
Famsize: number of own family members in household 
Blac: black indicator for child 
Female: female indicator for child 
Repeat:  indicator  whether  child  behind  at  least  once  grade  (based  on  school  entry  age  at  current  state  of 
residence and age of child) 
Higrres50: indicator for whether child’s grade below median for age/state group 
Regionm: region of mom’s state of birth (defined on IPUMS web site) 
 
We’re  interested  in  examining  the  intergenerational  effect  of  mother’s  compulsory  schooling  on  the 
probability that a child repeats a grade. 
 
1) Estimate  the first stage, both with  the individual sample and with aggregated cell means (if STATA runs 
out of RAM, find another computer to work on): 
 
MothEd
 
MothEd
  represents mother’s  education  level  for  the  group  of  youths  observed  in  census  year  y, 
where 
ylm
with  mothers  from  state  l   born  in  year  m ,  and  X   is  a  vector  of  variables  that  capture  the  child  group’s 
average    race, gender and age.   CL7, CL8, and CL9 which are dummy  variables  that denote  required years

of  schooling  prior  to  obtaining  a  work  permit  of  7,  8,  or  9  or  more  years.    You  may  use  an  alternative 
compulsory  schooling  measure  using  the  dropagem  variable  or  assuming  a  linear  single  variable  for 
CLmom or dropagem.    
 
How  are  the  concerns  about  the  validity  of  the  instrument  similar  to  concerns  that  arise  from  a  difference-
in-differences analysis?  What are the advantages with working with aggregated cell means? 
 
2) Produce a table that shows the first stage and reduced form for the full sample and the sample of mothers 
with more than 12 years of school.  Why does the second sample provide a sensitivity check to the analysis? 
 
3)  Produce  a  table  that  shows  the  OLS  and  IV  results  for  the  dependent  variables  repeat,  log  mother’s 
income, and  log  family  income, with and without regional  trends.   (If you’re working with cell means, you 
will have to aggregate up to include mother variation by higr2mom in order to run the OLS). 
 
4) We  can  examine whether  a  discontinuous  break  in  average  schooling  and  the  probability  of  repeating  a 
grade  occurs  the  year  after  a  compulsory  school  law  restriction.   The  dataset  leadlag.dta  contains  indicator 
variables  for whether an  increase  in  the CL  variable  occurred  or  is  about  to  occur.   The  variable m10, m9, 
m8, …, are indicator variables  that a  the CL variable will  increase 10 years from  the year a mother was 14, 
9  years,  8  years,  etc…    The  variables  p1,  p2,  p3, …  are  indicator  variables  that  the  CL  variable  increased 
the  year  a mother was  age  14,  1  year  earlier,  2  years  earlier,  etc…   The  data  include  years  and  states  only 
for  20  year  ranges where  one  change  occurred.   Thus,  if  there was  no  law  change  in  a  20  year  period,  the 
lead lag indicators were dropped. 
 
Merge  the  leadlag  data  to  your  collapsed  dataset.    Plot  or  make  a  table  of  the  lead  lags  using  mother’s 
schooling  and  the  repeat  variables  as  the  dependent  variables,  including,  at  least,  fixed  effects  for  birth 
cohort and mother’s  state of birth.   Try  this  just for  the  sample of mothers with at  least 12 years of  school.  
Why is this a good check on the validity of the instrument?  Do you find these results convincing? 
 
5) summarize your findings in Part I and Part II in one paragraph.
