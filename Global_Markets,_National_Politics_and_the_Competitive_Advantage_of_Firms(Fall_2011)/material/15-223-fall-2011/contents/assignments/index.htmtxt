The case write-ups should be brief, no more than 3 double-spaced pages. You may
choose any 2 cases to analyze. Cases include both the traditional HBS cases and
company/industry issues discussed in some of the readings. Write-ups are due
before class on the day the case is to be discussed. They are intended to be
analytic discussions of some issue central to the case. Please do not write a
precis of the case or repeat case facts except to bolster your argument. Based
on the information provided in the case materials, please be analytically
judgmental and evaluative. You should propose alternate managerial views and
action plans whenever appropriate and discuss the relevance and applicability
of the frameworks proposed in the readings and lectures. In short, you should
write what you think of the situation in the case and not merely what the
author of the case says. Be original. These case write-ups are individual
assignments.
