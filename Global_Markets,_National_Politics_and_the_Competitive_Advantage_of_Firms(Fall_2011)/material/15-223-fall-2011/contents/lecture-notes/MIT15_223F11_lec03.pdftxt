Porter’s diamond provides an easy way to think about the entire system of elements involved in 
determining what a country will produce – and which sectors or specific activities will be 
“competitive”.  In this context, “competitive” means that one or more firms has a sustainable 
advantage relative to firms in other countries, i.e., the country “wins” in international 
competition, most obviously through exporting. 
 
This helps us understand the pattern of trade and how this may change over time.  It also gives us 
a concrete way to think about what helps or hinders specific firm strategies – for example, 
demanding local consumers can become a source of competitive advantage (e.g., British tea). 
 
The more lasting determinants of competitive advantage are those that cannot be easily copied 
elsewhere.  “Factor conditions” may have some historical basis – like very strong universities 
with particular specialties – that are hard for others to emulate (e.g., IITs in India, aerospace in 
Brazil).  Related and supporting industries can be critical in many parts of manufacturing, e.g., 
autos (e.g., just-in-time production in Japan), but also in software (think about Silicon Valley). 
The extent of domestic rivalry always matters, with the interesting irony being that the 
development of a successful export industry may be more likely when there is intense local 
competition between several strong players (e.g., Korean chaebol). 
 
Porter also encourages us to think about how scarcity can become an advantage, e.g., lacking 
domestic energy supplies can encourage energy efficiency (or France’s nuclear power).  Also if a 
country has one compelling natural asset – like Singapore’s port – what is the best way to build 
dynamic firms around that? 
Porter pushes us to think about trade more broadly than just in terms of real wages – competing 
just on having the lowest price is often not sustainable.  New competition is always developing. 
 
Be careful with Porter’s framework, however, because it does not necessarily tell you, (a) where 
productivity is high, (b) where productivity will grow fast, or (c) what will be the real exchange 
rate (the latter was what we called competitiveness in 15.015 during H1).  One way to think 
about these issues is to think forward 10-15 years and ask: If we have this competitive advantage 
and it persists, what will happen to productivity levels? 
   
We can also augment Porter’s framework with additional considerations.  One element often 
stressed by other analysts is politics, including the various kinds of relationships between 
government and business.   
In many countries, government tries to help at least part of the business sector – for example with 
various kinds of advantages.  But that also slants the playing field against other firms and, 
particularly, against potential new entrants.  Protecting incumbents is not necessarily the best 
way to promote productivity growth (e.g., when protected behind tariff barriers or quotas, 
established firms tend not to be dynamic). 
If human capital is such a critical determinant of output per worker, as well as national 
competitive advantage, why can’t we just invest more in education for all Americans? 
Would “lifetime employment” help the US today?  Why not? 
How does Porter’s diamond help us think about potential economic growth in Africa? 

1US Financial Sector 
The US financial sector is an interesting case – and one that also has broader implications for 
both the domestic economy and the way the world works. 
At least traditionally, the US government has been relatively “hands-off”.  In theory, it sets rules 
and enforces laws, allowing the market place to take care of the rest.  In practice, politicians have 
close connections with business, through political contributions and other mechanisms.  At the 
end of the 19th century, the US Senate was known as “The Millionaire’s Club.”  The libertarian 
ideal may be attractive but it is hard to achieve in practice – the development of western parts of 
the US was very much a government strategy (and source of revenue), and railroads in particular 
relied on government decisions over land use. 
With the rise of “trust busting” at the start of the 20th century, the government took a more 
intrusive but somewhat selective role in determining when markets did not have enough 
competition.  The role of the federal government expanded from the 1930s and, particularly, 
after World War II – but most of this was (a) military related, and (b) transfers through social 
insurance programs (including healthcare in the 1960s). 
The financial sector was quite fragmented for a long time, but a process of consolidation 
gathered pace from the 1980s.  In part the motivation was creating a sector that could compete 
with large non-US banks, e.g., from Japan and Europe (and now China). 
Porter’s concern, expressed in the early 1990s, was that the system of incentives around traded 
US firms was too short-term oriented.  He is surely right to emphasize the importance of investor 
preferences – including the way investment managers are compensated. 
Porter may have overstated the attractions of “long-term” finance oriented systems.  The 
financial sector advantages of, for example, Germany and Japan look less compelling now than 
they did 20 years ago.  However, within those specific production systems, the domestic 
financial arrangements make sense to powerful participants and continue to persist. 
 
Emerging economies have struggled with both “arms-length” and “relationship-based” financial 
systems.  Best practice today is to prevent banks from being too close to their borrowers – and 
definitely to limit the extent of “self-dealing”.  But this is hard, particularly when there is a great 
deal of regulatory capture. 
The greatest instance of regulatory capture on record may be that of the US financial sector 
which, over the past 30 years, convinced policymakers that firms could manage macro-sized 
risks without jeopardizing the real economy.  Executives are often paid based on their return-on-
equity, unadjusted for risk. 
If a firm is seen by insiders and by credit markets as “too big to fail”, there is a strong incentive 
to borrow heavily relative to shareholder equity – high leverage means high returns on equity 
when things go well.  Of course, when things go badly, there is a problem – but if there is an 
implicit government guarantee of some kind, it is largely someone else’s problem. 
Porter is exactly right that changing one part of an integrated structure, like the US financial 
system, is hard.  Mostly the problems are about the political power of rich incumbents; they can 
lobby and buy a great deal of favor – from politicians, regulators, intellectuals.  Other parts of the 
private sector are unfortunately reluctant to stand up to the big banks.  
Is this a doom loop or the road to fiscal ruin?
