This section features the daily_assignments for the course. All the assignments
rely heavily on texts available in readings and audio files available in study
materials. For Part 1, review materials from Chinese III can be found in
readings, but more comprehensively at 21F.103Â (the Chinese III site).
***** Overview *****
The term is divided into five cycles. In all five, three sets of readings (from
Learning Chinese, Making Connections, and Strange Stories from a Chinese
Studio) are intermeshed. (Please see the abbreviations key below.) During
Cycles 2, 4 and 5, you also work towards a class presentation along the lines
described in the syllabus. All 5 cycles also have a written test, usually about
30 minutes long, and involving reading in characters and writing in pinyin.
There is no final examination.
***** Abbreviations Key *****
The assignments below make reference to sections within three particular
texts.Â "Unit" refers to the units of Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in
Mandarin (Part 4).Â  The listening text, Making Connections, is cited as "Conn-
1 (Greetings)", etc. And the reader, Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio, is
cited as "Story-1 (å«å¥å¿)", etc. Please refer to readings for more
information about these texts.
Note that the assignments are for the next day's class, regardless of how many
days intervene. "Home" assignments are in preparation for the next day's class;
"Class" assignments are in-class activities.
