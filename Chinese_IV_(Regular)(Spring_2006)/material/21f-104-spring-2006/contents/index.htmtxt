This course features a downloadable textbook (J. K. Wheatley's Learning
Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin) available in readings and includes
audio files of its main conversational and narrative material, available in
study_materials.
***** Course Description *****
This is the last of the four courses (Chinese I through IV) that make up the
foundation level (four semesters over two years in the normal curriculum) of
MIT's regular (non-streamlined) Chinese program. Chinese IV is designed to
consolidate conversational usage and grammatical and cultural knowledge
encountered in the earlier courses, and to expand reading and listening
abilities. It integrates the last part of Learning Chinese (two units designed
primarily for review of grammatical concepts and vocabulary growth) with
material from Madeline Spring's Making Connections, designed to bolster
listening skills, and Linda Hsai and Roger Yue's Strange Stories from a Chinese
Studio, a collection of traditional stories that has been a favorite of
students of Chinese for many decades and is used here to focus on reading.
Reading for this course is primarily, but not exclusively, in the simplified
character set that is the standard on the Mainland; readings in the traditional
set that is standard in Taiwan are also assigned.
Students who have advanced through Chinese I, II, and III to reach this level,
as well as those entering at Chinese IV, should review at least the late
material in Chinese III before proceeding.
***** Chinese Sequence on OCW *****
MIT OpenCourseWare now offers a complete sequence of four Chinese language
courses, covering beginning to intermediate levels of instruction at MIT. They
can be used not just as the basis for taught courses, but also for self-
instruction and elementary-to-intermediate review.
The four Chinese subjects provide the following materials: an online textbook
in four parts, J. K. Wheatley's Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in
Mandarin; audio files of the main conversational and narrative material in this
book; and syllabi and day-by-day schedules for each term.
