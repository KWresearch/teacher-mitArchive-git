Overview: In your essay, analyze an ethical situation from as many angles as possible, 
and then argue for a particular course of action. Assume your readers are skeptical about 
the course of action you are recommending, so you must use evidence and logical 
demonstrations and appeals to various tools in the “Ethical Tool Chest” handout in order 
to prove that your position is ethical and practical. 
 
Workshop Variation: Instead of doing a traditional workshop, each rhetor will present 
his/her case orally to the class; then class members will make suggestions about the ideas 
etc. So come to class prepared to give a speech about the case and to explain and defend 
your position. 
 
Organization: Follow this rhetorical arrangement (for this assignment, though, do not use 
headings): 
• A brief Introduction that establishes kairos (why should we—students and teacher of 
21W.747—be interested in this particular case at this particular time?) and that gives a 
forecast. 
• A Background section that briefly explains the major details of the case 
• An Ethical Analysis section which examines the ethical situation from as many angles 
as possible, explaining where and how various ethical elements from the “Ethics Tool 
Chest are in conflict; the more ethical elements you consider, the better the analysis will 
be. 

o If there is not enough relevant information given in the scenario, use the rhetorical 
“what if” technique 
o “If x were true, the moral implications would be…” and “If y were true, then the 
moral implications would be….” 
• An Ethical Argument section in which you explain the course of action that should be 
pursued and then prove that your position is the most ethical (usually this means that your 
position satisfies more principles etc. than any other, or that it partially satisfied more 
without ignoring others). 
o Note, if there are several participants involved, you need to discuss the best course 
of action for each of them as it relates to the overall “best” course of action you 
recommend. 
• A brief conclusion that states your thesis explicitly for the first time. The thesis of such 
an essay does not state the “right answer” (since there isn’t one); rather, the thesis might 
say something like: “Although the principles of utilitarianism (“greatest good”) and 
community suggest a different course of action, the principle of character growth, the 
Golden Rule, and participant K’s obligations to x and y show that participant K should do 
W.” Note too that the thesis in this essay should be in the conclusion rather than in the 
Intro. 
 

Directions: 
• After reading all 7 of the cases listed below from Chapter 10 in ETHICS, select one: 
o Case 10.4 (What was that again?”) 
o Case 10.9 (“Rent Battle”) 
o Case 10.10 (“Suicidal?”) 
o Case 10.11 (“With Charity Toward All”) 
o Case 10.12 (Contemporary Social Problems: Who Cares?”) 
o Case 10.13 (“Freedom of Religion?”) 
o Case 10.16 (“A Second Chance?”) 
• Use the terms and concepts from the “Ethics Tool Chest.” 
• Do not focus exclusively on the practical “consequences,” although those can certainly 
be part of your analysis. 
• The questions at the end of each Case raise important issues—try to include 
considerations of as many of these as fit comfortably in your analysis and argument. 
• This should be a coherent, thoughtful essay (and use no headings).
