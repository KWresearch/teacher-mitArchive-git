Overview: Write an analysis of 3-5 articles that deal with a controversy. This Project is 
NOT an argument about the controversy. It is an analysis and evaluation of the 
effectiveness of the authors’ use of ethics, rhetoric, and assumptions. Only in your section 
“My Position” should we learn your position on the controversy and a brief explanation 
of your reasons for believing so. Explicitly use the terminology and concepts from the 
“Ethics Tool Chest” and the “Rhetoric Tool Chest.” Quote Crowley where appropriate. 
You should include quotations from each article and your explanation of their relevance 
to your points. 
 
Directions: 
1. Identify a controversial issue that has been written about in various sophisticated 
sources. The issue must have an ethical component as well as a rhetorical component. 
a. The controversy might be a past or present controversy. 
b. The controversy might come from a profession (e.g., doctor, lawyer, chemist, civil 
engineer). 
c. The controversy might be one that has simply caught your interest. 
2. Locate 3-5 articles in sophisticated sources (e.g., journals, books, authoritative web 
sites). These articles must argue different positions on the controversy. Don’t take the 
first 3 articles you find. 
a. You need to evaluate the articles in terms of their covering a large range of techniques, 
ethical appeals, positions on the controversy, etc. In other words, part of the assignment is 
your selecting fruitful sources. 
b. Use the services of the reference librarians in the Haydn Library (14S-100) 
3. Select a controversy about which you can understand both sides. 
4. With most topics, one of the things you will need to discuss (and include as an 
appendix) is the Code of Ethics or Code of Conduct for members of whatever profession 
would be faced with that issue. 
5. Use the terminology and concepts from the “Ethics Tool Chest” and the “Rhetoric 
Tool Chest.” 
6. Suggested Topics: Here are some possible topics, but feel free to create your own: 
a. Select an issue from your future career (medicine, chemistry, engineering, law, etc.) 
b. You may select a real issue (e.g., Dr. Kevorkian, a law suit against a company or 
industry such as the tobacco industry, a case against a particular engineer or scientist) 
c. The Internet has useful sites for ethical issues confronting most major professions and 
explaining their Codes of Ethics or Codes of Conduct. 
7. Or you might select a current or past controversy that interests you. For instance, 
a. The rhetoric and arguments about invading Iraq before the war happened (a past 
controversy) 
b. The rhetoric and arguments about pulling out of Iraq (current controversy) 
c. The rhetoric and arguments surrounding any governmental plan or action (e.g., 

curtailing civil rights for safety, privatizing social security, the Patriot Act) 
d. The rhetoric surrounding racial or class bias (current or past)—e.g., read articles 
written in the 1850s supporting and attacking slavery, or articles about affirmative action 
8. Several Internet sites discuss or link to ethical controversies. One good place to start is 
http://www.ethicsweb.ca/resources/  
9. The more focused your topic is, the better able you will be to find sophisticated sources 
a. Sophisticated sources include journals and books written for specialists (e.g., 
Biomedical Ethics) and those written for well-informed lay readers--e.g., Harpers, 
Atlantic Monthly, New Yorker, The Nation (liberal), The National Review (conservative), 
Scientific American, Nature. Articles and editorials or columns from such sources would 
be good choices. 
b. Avoid less sophisticated sources such as Time, Newsweek, US News and World 
Report.
