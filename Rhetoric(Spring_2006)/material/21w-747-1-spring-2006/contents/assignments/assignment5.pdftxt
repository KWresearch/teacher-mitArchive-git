Due: 15th class, 4/6 (T)—bring 4 copies to class 
Mandatory Revision Due: 16th class, 4/11 (R)-- EMAIL me a copy before class 
Optional Revision Last Possible Date: 5/16 (R) 
Length: 1500-2500 words, ~6-12 double-spaced pages each). 
 
Directions: Systematically examine the theme and 2-4 units of analysis in a text in order 
to determine if that text succeeds in its stated (or implied) purpose(s) and to explain how 
rhetoric works. 
o A Unit of Analysis is one significant rhetorical element (see “Rhetoric Tool Chest”) 
 
Procedure: 
• Select 1 of the 4 essays below to analyze: 
• Dillard’s “Living Like Weasels” (245-251) 
• Hazlitt’s “On the Pleasures of Hating” (365-376) 
• Porter’s “The Necessary Enemy” (603-608) 
• Singer’s “Animal Liberation” (handout) 
• Develop a Research Question about rhetoric. Your Research Question should not 
mention the particular text by name—e.g., for King’s “Letter,” one Research Question 
might be: “How does a rhetor use metaphors to develop an appeal to pathos and to 
reinforce his/here text’s theme?” 
• You have unique analytical and ethical insights to offer, but you have to do the 
exploration and thinking required to develop those insights into a convincing and 
compelling way. 
• Read the text carefully, noting various units of analysis and deciding on the theme(s). 
• Select 2-4 units (no more), and go through the text again, looking for and listing all 
examples of each unit. (e.g., you would make a list of all the metaphors in the text). 
• Then categorize them (e.g., metaphors of light, of modern vs. old-fashion, of salvation). 
• The list and categories, however, are merely raw data. You need to answer, “So what?” 
Decide/ discover the impact that unit has on the meaning and effect of the whole text . 
 
Structure:  
Your essay should have the following 6 sections (use the headings). Remember that each 
section has its own purpose, so don’t evaluate in the analysis section, etc. Here are the 
sections: 
• Intro –an Intro does the following: 
o Names the author and the document and its original source. 
o Establishes kairos—why should we particular readers care about this particular text 
at this particular time? Your Research Question should be a big help with this task. 
o Explain the rhetorical situation (audience, context, occasion, where the document 
was first published or delivered as a speech, etc.). The Credits (ESSAYS, 829 ff) will 
give you most of that information. Don’t assume that an older text no longer applies 
to our modern world. 
o Use internal evidence within the text to describe the implied (ideal) audience. 
o This audience analysis should include a forecast of the next 2 sections of your essay 
(“Author X’s theme, his/her use of units q and y indicate that the implied audience for 

this text would be people who … (e.g., already agree with him/her; people who are 
skeptical about his/her thesis; people who do not initially see the relevance of the 
thesis to themselves; people who are curious; people who share characteristics K and 
V with the author, etc.”) 
• Summary of the rhetor’s purpose, thesis, theme, and major points (1-2 paragraphs). 
• Analysis—1-4 paragraphs dedicated to analyzing each unit of analysis (use a 
subheading for each unit of analysis). The paragraph(s) should explain that unit’s 
effect/effects (intended by author and felt by you). Explain not only what the effects are 
but why the unit of analysis causes those effects. 
• Insight: 1-4 paragraphs that explain what this text reveals about rhetoric and, if 
applicable, ethics. 
• Evaluation: 1-4 paragraphs that explain what you thought of the author’s argument and 
presentation and why. 
• Reflection: 1-4 paragraphs that answer such questions as: What is the text’s relevance to 
my work and my intellectual life? Whose interests are being served by the composition 
and preservation of this text?
