- A little bit of it even in “flexible ” exchange 
rates systems; “commitment ” to E rather 
than M

Note: There is a shift in the IS as well… but 

this is small, especially in the short run 

Building the Aggregate Supply


	 The labor market 
	 Simple markup pricing

	 Long run (Natural rate: Aggregate demand 
factors don’t matter for Y) 
	 Short run 

–  Impact: Same as before but P also change 
(partial) 
–  Dynamics (go toward Natural rate)

Real wages 
Nominal wage setting 

Bargaining power 
Fear of unemployment 

Unemployment insurance 
Hiring rate (reallocation)

* The price level    	

vs 

The inflation rate


P(t)  =  P (t)  (1+ µ) F(u(t), z) 
e


Note that: 
P(t)/P(t-1) = 1 + (P(t)-P(t-1))/P(t-1)


e
e

P(t)/P(t-1) = 1 + (P(t)-P(t-1))/P(t-1) 

Let 

π(t)  = (P(t)-P(t-1))/P(t-1) 


• Then 


(1+π(t))  = (1+πe(t)) (1+ µ) F(u(t), z) 

but

ln(1+x) ≈ x 

if x is “small”

Let also assume that  


ln(F(u(t), z)) =  z –  αu(t)
