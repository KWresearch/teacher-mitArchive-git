Demand Determined Output


•  Aggregate demand (Z): 
Z = C + I + G + (X-Q) 
– 
•  Aggregate supply: 
  fixed P
 
–  as much as needed to satisfy demand 
•  Model: 
–  behavioral equations 
–  equilibrium conditions

Behavioral Equations


(for now) 
•  X-Q  =  0   
•  G and I: constant 
•  C = c0 + c1*YD;
•  YD =  Y - T,  

 0<c1<1

 c0>0 ;
T  constant 

Z = (c0 - c1*T + I + G) + c1*Y 

Equilibrium
