accumulation / Technological progress 
•  Y  = F(K,NA)   h.d. 1

y= (Y/NA) =  F(K/NA,1) = f(k)

Solow’s Growth Model

A = 1, N = 1


Y= y  =  f(k) 


S  = sY 


I = S 


K(t+1) = (1-d) K(t) + I(t) 

=> 

k(t+1) - k(t) = s f(k(t)) - d k(t) 


Figures 11-1, 11-2 


Steady State and the Saving Rate

In steady state: k(t+1)=k(t)=k*


k(t+1) - k(t) = s f(k(t)) - d k(t) 

=> 

sf(k*) = d k* 


g_y* = 0 

(if n>0,  g_y*=0 => g_Y=g_K=n>0)


In steady state, the saving rate does NOT matter for per-capita growth. 

It does matter, however, for the level of per-capita output and transitional 
dynamics

Some numbers

• Y = (KN)0.5   =>  y = (K/N)0.5 =k0.5 
• k(t+1)-k(t)= s k(t)0.5  - dk(t)  
	 St.St:   k*=(s/d)^2   ;  y*=(s/d) 
s0=d=0.1;  s1=0.2  => 
	 k* goes from 1 to 4 and y* from 1 to 2. 

	 Higher saving=> need to maintain more 
capital 

c* = y*- dk*
