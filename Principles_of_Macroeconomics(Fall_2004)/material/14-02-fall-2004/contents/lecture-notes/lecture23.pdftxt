Bond Prices and Yields


•  Two dimensions”
–  Default Risk (not all issuers are alike! e.g. 
Argentina vs Switzerland) … poor Italian 
grandmothers … 
–  (*) Maturity (length of time over which the 
bond promises to make payments) 
•  The Yield Curve (term structure of interest rates) 
–  Figure 15-1 



Bond Prices 


	 A bond that promises one payment of a 
$100 in n year is worth P_n(t) at time t: 

P_n(t) = $100/((1+i(t))..(1+ie(t+n-1))) 
If  i is constant, 

P_n(t) = $100/(1+i)n 

•
The Yield Curve


• The  yield to maturity on an n-tear bond is the 
constant interest rate that makes the bond price 
today equal to the present value payments of the 
bond (sort of an  “average ”): 
$100/(1+i_n(t)) = $100/((1+i(t))..(1+ie(t+n-1))) 
Approx:  i_n(t)  ≈ (i(t) + ie(t+1)+ …)/n 

Easy example: If ie(t+s) = i => i_n(t) = i

	 P(t) = de(t+1)/(1+i(t)) + 
de(t+2)/((1+i(t))(1+ie(t+1))+…

Bubbles

	 Fundamental vs Bubbles 
P(t) = (de(t+1)+P(t+1))/(1+i(t)) 
	 Tulipmania: 1,500 guineas in 1964 … to 7,500 by 
1967 (the price of a house) … a few years later, 
10% of the the 1967 price. 
	 MMM Pyramid in Russia: Sold shares promising a 
rate of return of  3,000% per year! In six months, 
P went from 1,600 rubles to 105,000 rubles … … 
the company didn ’t produce anything! It 
crashed … and Mavrody became a politician …
