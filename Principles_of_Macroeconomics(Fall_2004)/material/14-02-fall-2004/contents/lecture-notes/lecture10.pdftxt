Z  =  C  +  I  +  G  +  X - e Q 

C(Y-T) + I(Y,I) + G 

Q  =  Q(Y,e)

X  =   X(Y*,e)

The J-Curve


	 eQ(Y,e)  : increase or decrease with e? 

In the very short run: it may increase!

	 And if strong enough: X(Y*,e) - eQ(Y,e) 
may do the same.

depreciation; fig 19-6

Interest parity 

Two IS caveats:

Y

E


a)  Multiplier is smaller 
b)  Interest rate affects aggregate demand through the E as well.
