Lecture 4: Financial Markets


	 Goal: Determine equilibrium interest rate 

	 Short run 
	 Main cyclical instrument (Central Bank) 

	 Monetary policy (as opposed to fiscal 
policy) -- both are (primarily) aggregate 
demand policies

Financial Assets


	 Money, bonds, stocks, mutual funds, 
derivatives … 
	 Reduce to two: 
	 Money: transaction (liquidity) role. 
	 Bond: investment -- pays an interest rate: i 
	 Key question: How much of each? 
–  Tradeoff: transaction services vs return.

Money Demand


Fix (nominal) wealth at: PWealth


d 
d 
M  +  B  =

 PWealth 

=>  determine only one of them 


d 
M  = P Y L(i)

High U.S. nominal interest rates during  late 70s (cid:173)
early 80s  => sharp decline in   M/PY 

Equilibrium Interest rate


	 Simple model: 

–  Money supply is constant (i.e. it doesn ’t depend 
on  interest rate or P or Y) 
	 Equilibrium: 

M  =  P Y L(i) 
	 Our interest is to determine the interest rate, 
so we fix  P and Y.

Open Market Operation


•  Central Bank buys bonds in the open market

	 As a result, price of bonds rises 

=>  interest rate falls 

i  =
