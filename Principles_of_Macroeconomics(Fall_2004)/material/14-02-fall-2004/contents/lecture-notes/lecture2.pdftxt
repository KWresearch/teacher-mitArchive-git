Lecture 2: Basic Definitions


•  GDP 
•  Inflation Rate 
•  Unemployment Rate 
•  Trade and Budget Deficits 


Gross Domestic Product


•  First thing we look at (its rate of growth)

•  Aggregate output: Not easy! 
–  Sum of apples and oranges 
–  Double-counting 
• Example  

• 

A Simple Economy 

Steel Company 
–  Revenue from sales 
–  Expenses (wages) 
– Profit  

• 

Car Company 
–  Revenue from sales 
–  Expenses 
• Wages  
•  Steel purchases 
– Profit  
•  What is this economy ’s GDP?

Calculating GDP


	 Method 1: GDP is the value of the final 
goods and services produced by the 
economy during a given period 
	 Method 2: GDP is the sum of valued added 
produced …. 
	 Method 3: GDP is the sum of incomes in the 
economy...

Nominal vs Real GDP


	 Nominal GDP: sum of final goods produced 
times their current price 
–  Growth due to quantity (production) 
–  Growth due to prices 
	 Real GDP:  … times their  base year price 

	 Example (next trp.) 
	 GDP Growth: (Y(t)-Y(t-1))/Y(t-1)

The Inflation Rate

	 More than one…. (P(t)-P(t-1))/P(t-1)

	 GDP deflator and CPI 
	 GDP deflator = Nominal GDP / GDP 
– P0 = 1  
–  P1 = 230,000/210,000 = 1.1 (approx.) 
	 NGDP growth = GDPg + Inflation (defl)

The Unemployment Rate 

	 Labor force (L) = Empl. (N) + Unemployed (U) 

	 Unemployment Rate (u) =  U/L 
	 Willing to work? Looking for work?   L < Pop. 

	 Not in the labor force 
	 Discouraged workers (recessions) 
	 High unemployment often comes hand on hand 
with low participation rate : 
L/Pop of working age 
	 U.S.  (u = 4%, pr = 80% )  France  (u=13%, pr = 65%)

	 Why do we care?   Too high and ….  too low??

Deficits


	 Expenditure  >  Income 
	 Trade Deficit : 
–  Imports  >  Exports 
–  U.S. today (FED, Treasury, Japan) 
	 Budget deficit 
–  Gov. Expenditure > Gov. Revenue 
	 Why do we care? Smoothing; Argentina … 
the US
