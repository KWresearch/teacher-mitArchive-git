Lectures 19-20:  Savings and 

Technology 


• Review  

•  Cont.: Change in Saving rate


•  Technological progress 

Solow’s Growth Model

A = 1, N = 1


Y= y  =  f(k) 


S  = sY 


I = S 


K(t+1) = (1-d) K(t) + I(t) 

=> 

k(t+1) - k(t) = s f(k(t)) - d k(t) 

Steady State and the Saving Rate

In steady state: k(t+1)=k(t)=k*


k(t+1) - k(t) = s f(k(t)) - d k(t) 

=> 

sf(k*) = d k* 


g_y* = 0 

(if n>0,  g_y*=0 => g_Y=g_K=n>0)


In steady state, the saving rate does NOT matter for per-capita growth. 

It does matter, however, for the level of per-capita output and transitional 
dynamics 

Figures 11-3, 11-4 

Some numbers

• Y = (KN)0.5   =>  y = (K/N)0.5 =k0.5 
• k(t+1)-k(t)= s k(t)0.5  - dk(t)  
	 St.St:   k*=(s/d)^2   ;  y*=(s/d) 
s0=d=0.1;  s1=0.2  => 
	 k* goes from 1 to 4 and y* from 1 to 2. 

	 Higher saving=> need to maintain more 
capital 

c* = y*- dk*  
	 The Golden Rule: Table 11-1

Dynamics


•  Dynamics: k(1) = 1+0.2-0.1 = 1.1>1 

… and so on

Technological Progress


• Table 12-2  
•  Y = F(K,N,A)   …..  Y=F(K,NA) 
•  y = Y/NA = F(K/NA,1) = f(K/NA) = f(k)

•  I/AN = s Y/AN 
•  In order to maintain a given k, we need to 

invest at least: 

(d+g_A + g_N) K 


Technological Progress


I/AN  >  (d+g_A + g_N) (K/AN)  
=>  k grows

A Decline in g_A


•  Table  12-2
•  Table  12-1
•  (use) Figure  12-2
•  Why? (we don ’t know …) 
–  Measurement error? 
–  The rise of the Service Sector? 
•  Figure  12-5

–  Decreased R&D Expenditure?
