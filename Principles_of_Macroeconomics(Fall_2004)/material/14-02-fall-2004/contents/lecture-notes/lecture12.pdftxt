Lecture 12: Building the 

Aggregate Supply  

•  Current Events 
•  Wage and price determination 

•  The natural rate of U 
–  From natural U to natural Y 

•  Aggregate Supply 

Building the Aggregate Supply


	 The labor market 
	 Simple markup pricing

	 Long run (Natural rate: Aggregate demand 
factors don’t matter for Y) 
	 Short run 

–  Impact: Same as before but P also change 
(partial) 
–  Dynamics (go toward Natural rate)

Wage Determination


•  Bargaining and efficiency wages


e
W  = 
  P F(u,z) 

Real wages 
Nominal wage setting 

Bargaining power 
Fear of unempllyment 

Unemployment insurance 
Hiring rate (reallocation) 
Bargaining 

Price Determination


•  Production function (simple)


Y  = N 

=> 

P  = 

(1+µ) W 

The Natural Rate of 

Unemployment

P = P 
“Long Run”

•  The wage and price setting relationships:


W  =  F(u,z) 
P 

P  =   1+ µ 
W 

=> 
The natural rate of unemployment 

F(u,z)  =  1
