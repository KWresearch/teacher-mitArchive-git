Lecture 15:  The Phillips Curve 


From AS to the Phillips Curve


* The price level    	

vs 

The inflation rate


P(t)  =  P (t)  (1+ µ) F(u(t), z) 
e


Note that: 
P(t)/P(t-1) = 1 + (P(t)-P(t-1))/P(t-1)

e

P(t)/P(t-1) = 1 + (P(t)-P(t-1))/P(t-1) 

Let 

π(t)  = (P(t)-P(t-1))/P(t-1) 


• Then 


(1+π(t))  = (1+πe(t)) (1+ µ) F(u(t), z) 

but

ln(1+x) ≈ x 

if x is “small”

Let also assume that  


ln(F(u(t), z)) =  z –  αu(t)
