Lectures 21:  Technological Progress 

and Unemployment 

	 Y = F(K,A N) … simplify to 

	 Y = AN   => 
• N = Y/A  
	 Does employment rise or fall with an 
increase in A? (Technological U  – The 
Luddites -- France today) 
–  The long run 

–  The short run

In the short run, there could be insufficient 
demand…

A?

Back to Price and Wage Setting


•  Price setting 

P = (1+ µ ) W/A   

•  Wage setting 

W = Ae  Pe  F(u,z) 

Back to the Natural Rate


•  Natural:  Expected = Actual 

PS: 

W/P = A/(1+µ ) 

WS: 

W/P = AF(u,z) 

AF(un,z) = 1/(1+ µ )
