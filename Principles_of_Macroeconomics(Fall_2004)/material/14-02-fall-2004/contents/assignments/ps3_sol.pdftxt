Justify your answer with a short argument. 

1. 	 Suppose interest rates for a one-period deposit are 5% in the US (the home country) and 2% 
in Canada. Assume that the risk premium in Canada is the same as in the US. This implies 
that the investor should invest in the US.

Canada. Here, i=5% and i*=2%.  Therefore, if the dollar is expected to depreciate by more

depreciate by less, then she should invest in the US. (See page 388.)

2. 	 Dan (a US citizen) pays $160,000 in cash to a US Mercedes Benz dealer for a 2005 SL500 
Roadster. The dealer then pays $150,000 to Mercedes Benz of Germany. Mercedes deposits 
$150,000 in its US bank account. This transaction has increased the US capital account 
surplus. (Assume there is no statistical discrepancy.) 

True.  Mercedes cars are US imports. Therefore, Dan’s purchase is recorded as -150,000 in 
the US current account. Why not $160,000?  It is because the dealer is also a US agent.  
Thus, the $10,000 that the dealer keeps after the transaction does not affect the current 
account. On the other hand, +150,000 is recorded in the US capital account. (Mercedes has 
increased its holding of US currency.) 

3. 	 Following a real depreciation, the trade balance improves. 

Uncertain.  We need to distinguish between what happens in the short-run vs. what happens 
in the long-run. If we look at the effects of a real depreciation over time, we see that it 
initially increases the trade deficit, because ε rises, but neither IM nor X changes right away. 
Thus, in the short run, the trade balance actually worsens. As time passes, however, exports 
begin to increase and imports decreases, reducing the trade deficit. (Recall that the trade 
balance or net exports is NX = X(Y*,ε) –  εIM(Y,ε).) The real exchange rate, ε, enters the 
right-hand side of this expression in three places. As a result of an increase in ε (a real 
depreciation), exports, X, increase; imports, IM, decrease; and the relative price of foreign 
goods, ε, increases. Thus, for the trade balance to improve following a real depreciation 
exports must increase enough and imports must decrease enough to compensate for the

way to arrive at the approximation.)  If you were to use the exact version, this number would be 2.94%. 

increase in the price of imports.  The condition under which a real depreciation leads to an 
increase in net exports is known as the Marshall-Lerner condition. (Note, however, that this 
condition is satisfied in reality.) (See page 406.) Therefore, eventually the trade balance 
improves beyond its initial level. This adjustment is referred to as the J-curve. (See pages 
408-410) 

4.	 Consider the Mundell-Flemming model of a small open economy. If the government 
increases taxes, the exchange rate will depreciate.  (Assume taxes are lump-sum, not 
proportional.) In order to bring the exchange rate down to its original level, the Fed should 
expand the money supply. 

False.  The first part of the statement is true: by increasing taxes, the government enacts 
contractionary fiscal policy. This shifts the IS curve to the left, which implies that the interest 
rate declines.  According to the interest rate parity condition, the exchange rate increases 
(depreciates). (See page 425.)

However, the last sentence is false. Expansionary monetary policy, that shifts the LM 
curve down and to the right, decreases the interest rate even further, leading to an even 
larger depreciation of the exchange rate.

5.	 Compared to the closed economy, a given increase in government spending will cause a 
larger increase in output in the open economy with flexible exchange rates. (Assume that the 
two economies start in equilibrium.) 

False.  An increase in government spending will, indeed, cause an increase in output in the 
open economy.  However, because the multiplier is smaller in the open economy, this 
increase in output will be smaller than in closed economy. This is because imports are an 
increasing function of domestic output.  As income rises due to the increase in government 
spending, consumers buy more imports, as well as more domestic goods, and therefore some 
of the positive effect on domestic output is lost. (See page 401 and answer to Part II, question 
6.) Another reason for why the increase in output will be smaller comes from the exchange 
rate. An increase in government spending raises the interest rate and leads to an 
appreciation, which lowers net exports and offsets part of the positive effect on Y (see page 
424). 

6. 	 In an open economy, fiscal policy is more effective than (or at least as effective as) monetary 
policy (in terms of changing output). 

False.  In an open economy with fixed exchange rates, fiscal policy is, indeed, more effective 
than monetary policy. In fact, monetary policy has absolutely no effect.  (See pages 429-430.) 
However, in an open economy with flexible exchange rates, monetary policy should actually 
be more effective, since there is an additional channel through which it can affect output. 
Consider monetary vs. fiscal contraction.  If the central bank decreases money supply, 
domestic interest rates increase and output decreases. But as the interest rates rises relative 
to the interest in the rest of the world, more investment comes in from abroad (because the 
return on it is higher at home), and this increases the demand for the home currency. Thus, it 
will appreciate making the domestic goods relatively more expensive than in the rest of the 
world, which will lower exports and increase imports. This will decrease US output even 
more.  On the other hand, fiscal policy is less effective in this case. Suppose the government 
decreases spending (or increases taxes).  People will consume less, but part of this will be 
manifested in lower imports.  So, part of the contraction will be felt abroad. 

Part II.   The Goods Market in a Two-Country Model 

Consider two open economies, Blanchardostan and the Republic of Caballeria.  Assume that 
these countries only trade with each other. Variables with subscript B and variables with 
subscript C correspond to Blanchardostan and the Republic of Caballeria, respectively. The 
two economies are characterized by the following set of equations: 

Ci = c0i + c1i(Yi -Ti) where i = B or C (B for Blanchardostan and C for Caballeria) 
Ii = I 
Gi = G i 
Ti = tiYi 
IMi = im0i + im1iYi 
ε = 1 

1. 	 Derive the expression for equilibrium output YB as a function of GB and YC (Note that YC is 
exogenous from the perspective of Blanchardostan.) Similarly, derive the expression for YC. 

Note that XB = εIMC =ε( im0C + im1CYC) = im0C + im1CYC (since ε=1).

YB = CB + IB + GB + XB - εIMB

YB = c0B + c1B(YB – t BYB) +  I  + G + im0C + im1CYC - im0B - im1BYB

YB (1- c1B(1-tB) + im1B) = c0B +  I  + G + im0C + im1CYC - im0B

YB =1000

YC =620 


3.  Calculate the trade balance (i.e. the current account) for each country.  Is there a trade/current 
account deficit or surplus in Blanchardostan? In the Republic of Caballeria? 
XB  –  εIMB = XB – IM B =IMC – IM B = im0C + im1CYC - im0B - im1BYB =0.3(620)-0.05(1000) =136 

So, Blanchardostan has a trade surplus of 136 million. Caballeria has a trade deficit of 136 
million.

Note that the increase in government spending increases Blanchardostan’s output. Because 
of this, its imports increase as well.  But since Blanchardostan’s impor ts are exports of the 
other country, this expansionary fiscal policy also has positive effects on the output of the 
Republic of Caballeria. 

An alternative and more explicit way of finding the multiplier in this open economy is the 
following: 

YB =4/3 (constant + GB + 0.3YC) and we know that YC =570+0.05YB

Thus plugging YC into YB, we get that:

YB )

So, notice that this is our exogenous multiplier (that we find in part 6) times a multiplier 
which comes from the fact that exports are endogenous (intuitively, this multiplier

1 − im1B im1C


.)


6. 	 Assume that exports are exogenously given from now on. What is the open economy 
government spending multiplier in Blanchardostan? Suppose the two economies decide to 
close.  What is the government spending multiplier in Blanchardostan now, assuming all the 
other figures remained the same? Compare the different multipliers that you found in parts 5 
and 6.

≈  43.1


The closed economy multiplier is the largest, because the effect of an increase in government 
spending is only felt at home. (Imports do not increase.)  In an open economy, part of the 
effect of the fiscal expansion is felt in the foreign country, because domestic imports rise, and 
therefore domestic output rises by less than it would in a closed economy. That’s the end of 
the story if exports are fixed, as we have assumed in part 6. However, if exports are not given 
exogenously, (part 5), as the foreign economy (i.e. Caballeria) expands (due to the rise of its 
exports), it begins to demand more of Blanchardostan’s exports.  That’s why the multiplier is 

larger in this case and the effect of expansionary fiscal policy is greater.  In our case, this 
End . X  and  m B 
Exog . X
feedback mechanism is given by the difference between  m B 
. So, higher 
government spending in Blanchardostan increases its output and imports.  Since 
Blanchardostan’s imports equal  Caballeria’s exports, this fis cal expansion also increases 
Caballeria’s output.  But this means it impor ts more from Blanchardostan, and so on. 

When is it okay to assume that exports are exogenous, and when are they endogenously 
determined?  Typically, we assume that exports are exogenous when we deal with small open 
economies. Intuitively, it makes sense to assume that Luxembourg’s policy choices do not 
affect the US economy, for example.  However, if we are analyzing two large economies, 
such as the US and the UK, we need to account for endogeneity of exports.  

Part III.   Fixed Exchange Rates 

Consider a small open economy (call it Mundellia) which obeys our Mundell-Flemming 
model and is the domestic country. Assume that it has a credible fixed exchange rate regime 
and starts out in equilibrium. Assume that for Mundellia, US represents “the rest of the 
world.” 

1.	 Use intuition and diagrams to explain what happens in Mundellia as a result of the 

following changes. 


a.	 There is an increase in consumer confidence in Mundellia.

output would settle at Y1
an appreciation of the exchange rate in 
Mundellia. But under the fixed regime, the 
central bank cannot allow the currency to 
appreciate. As the increase in output leads 
to an increase in the demand for Mundellian 
money, the central bank must accommodate 
this increase demand for money by 
increasing the money supply. (What if it 
didn’t increase the money supply? Then, we 
would have i>iUS and there would be 
infinite capital inflows. The fixed exchange 
rate would not be sustainable.) Thus, the LM curve will shift down and to the right, so 
that the interest rate and, therefore, the exchange rate do not change. The equilibrium

Mundellia 

As the US Fed decreases money supply, US interest rates increase, because the LM curve 
shifts up and to the left.  Through the uncovered interest rate parity, the dollar 
appreciates.  But, because Mundellian currency is pegged to the dollar (EM = EUS), it 
also must appreciate and the interest rates in Mundellia rise as well.  The central bank 
must accommodate this increase. (If the central bank didn’t decrease money supply, we 
would have i<iUS and there would be infinite capital outflows. Again, as in the previous 
part, the fixed exchange rate would not be sustainable.) Thus, the LM shifts up and to the 
M to Y1  .

2.	 Discuss the pros (if any) and cons (if any) of the Mundellian fixed exchange rate regime. 
(Use intuition and your analysis in part 1 to answer this question.) 

We know that under a fixed exchange rate and perfect capital mobility, the Mundellian 
interest rate must equal to the US interest rate. This condition implies that under fixed 
exchange rates, the central bank gives up monetary policy as a policy instrument.  (See 
pages 428-429.) We have seen from part 1, that all the Mundellian central bank can do is 
be a passive accommodator, never a policymaker. This can be very dangerous.  In part 
1b, the Mundellian interest rate increased following rising interest rates in the US, which 
brought Mundellian output down.  We can imagine a scenario, where the US Fed enacts 
contractionary monetary policy to cool down a booming economy, which is an 
appropriate response.  However, this also increases interest rates and decreases output 
in Mundellia, where the economy is not necessarily booming.  The increase in interest 
rates has an additional adverse effect of lowering Mundellian investment. Thus, if the US 
and Mundellian economies do not have similar “boom-bust” cycles, pegging the 
exchange rate to the dollar may be detrimental.  

On the other hand, as we have seen in part 1a, Mundellian fiscal policy is more effective 
under a fixed exchange rate system. On the surface this seems like a pro for pegging the 
exchange rate to the dollar – fiscal expansi on increases output by more than under 
flexible exchange rates (all else equal) because it triggers monetary accommodation. 

	
However, one policy instrument is not enough. The large impact on output due to 
expansionary fiscal policy comes at a cost of a larger trade deficit. (See page 430.) 

So far, we have focused primarily on the negative side of a fixed exchange rate system.  
To stay within the scope of Chapter 20, we will only mention some of the pros.  If the 
Mundellian economy closely followed the US economy in terms of its recessions and 
booms, it would not suffer that much from inability to enact monetary policy.  Essentially, 
it would surrender that role to the US Fed. What would it gain?  It would gain credibility 
that is associated with the US.  Political considerations play a major role in a country’s 
decision whether or not to adopt a fixed exchange rate regime. To learn more about the 
pros and cons of a fixed exchange rate regime, refer to Chapter 21.
