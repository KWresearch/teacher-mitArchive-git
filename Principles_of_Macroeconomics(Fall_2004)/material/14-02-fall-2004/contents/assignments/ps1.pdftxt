Due in class:  Wednesday, September 22, 2004 

Part I.  	True/False/Uncertain 
Justify your answer with a short argument. 

1. 	 From 1960 to 2000, the US, EU, and Japan all have experienced similar rates of 
unemployment.   

2. 	 GDP is the value of all goods and services produced in the economy. 

3. 	 The Phillips Curve describes the negative relationship between the change in unemployment 
rate and inflation. 

4. 	 Inflation is bad for the economy because goods and services are more expensive. 

5. The multiplier (Keynesian multiplier) is always greater than 1 if T = 0 and G = 0.   

Part II.  	NATIONAL ACCOUNTS  (GDP, GDP DEFLATOR & CPI)

   For part II, assume the following: 
1.	 MIT is an autonomous country.   
2.	 The only good/service produced at MIT is undergrad (freshmen) education. 

1. 	 Fill in the following: 

year 

1950 
2000 
2001 
2002 
2003 
2004 

# of MIT 
freshmen 

Price  
(Tuition) 

Nominal GDP 

Real GDP 
(1950 $) 

Real GDP 
(2000$) 

300 
900 
1,000 
1,100 
1,000 
1,200 

2,000 
20,000 
21,000 
23,000 
25,000 
28,000 

2. 	 Find the growth rate of nominal GDP for 2002, 2003 and 2004. 

3. 	 Find the growth rate of real GDP (using 2000 $) for 2002, 2003 and 2004. 

4. 	 Find the growth rate of real GDP (using 1950 $) for 2002, 2003 and 2004. 

5. 	 Why are your answers in 2, 3 and 4 different/same? 

6. 	 Compute inflation using GDP deflator (using 2000$) for 2002, 2003, 2004.   

7. 	 Beside GDP deflator what other price indices are used in measuring inflation? 

8.	 Which one is the best?  Why? 

Part III.  THE GOODS MARKET 
(All units are millions of US dollars) 

C =  500 +(0.5)YD 
I  =  100 
T =  80 
G = 200 

1.	 Solve for the goods market equilibrium.  (Find equilibrium Y, Z, C, and YD.) 

2.	 Graph (with correct labels) equilibrium Y and Z. 

3.	 Solve for private saving and public saving.   

4.	 What is the value of marginal propensity to consume (mpc)?  What does it mean? 

5.	 What is the value of marginal propensity to save (mps)? 

6.	 What is the relationship between mpc and mps? 

7.	 Find the multiplier and autonomous spending.  Explain what they mean.  

8.	 Now, the government is facing a reelection and increases G from 200 to 240.  (Fiscal 
expansion)  Why would the government want do so?  Find the equilibrium demand, 
output, consumption, and disposable income, then graph.
