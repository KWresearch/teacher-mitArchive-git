Part I.  True/False/Uncertain 
Justify your answer with a short argument. 

1. 	 In an economy with technological progress, the saving rate is irrelevant in the long-run. 

False.  It is true that the rate of capital and output growth in steady state is independent of 
the saving rate. However, the saving rate does affect the steady-state level of output per 
effective worker. Suppose there is an increase in the saving rate.  Then, capital per effective 
worker and output per effective worker will increase for some time as they converge to their 
new higher level. Their growth rate will eventually return to the sum of the population 
growth rate and the technological growth rate (gA + gN). (See pages 250-251.) 

2. 	 The rate of technological progress declined in the mid-1970s due to the rise of the service 
sector. 

Uncertain. Why the rate of technological progress declined in the mid-1970s is one of the 
unanswered questions in economics. The explanation that involves the rise of the service 
sector is only one of a few different hypotheses that have been proposed. Other explanations 
include decreased R&D spending (a decline not in the amount, but rather in the fertility of 
R&D) or measurement error (that, in fact, there was no slowdown in the rate of 
technological progress at all). (See pages 256-258.) 

3. 	 There is much theoretical and empirical support for the idea that faster productivity growth 
leads to higher unemployment. 

False.  In the short-run, there is no reason to expect, nor does there appear to be, a 
systematic relationship between movements in productivity growth and movements in 
unemployment. In the medium- /long-run, if there is a relation between productivity growth 
and unemployment, it appears to be an inverse relationship. Lower productivity growth leads 
to higher unemployment and vice versa. (See pages 277-278.) 

4. 	 Increased globalization and technological progress can both be blamed, at least to some 
extent, for the increase in wage inequality in the United States. 

True. An increase in globalization leads to an increase in international trade. Those firms 
that employ higher proportions of low-skilled workers are increasingly driven out of the 
market by imports from similar firms in low-wage countries, according to this argument.  
The other line of argument focuses on skill-biased technological progress. New machines 
and new methods of production require higher-skilled workers. (See pages 280-281.) 

5. 	 The Fisher hypothesis states that, in the short-run, the nominal interest rate increases one for 
one with inflation, while the real interest rate remains unchanged. 

False.  In the short-run, the increase in nominal money growth leads to an increase in the 
real money stock. This translates into a decrease in the real, as well as in the nominal, 
interest rate. (See page 302.) The Fisher hypothesis states that in the medium-/long-run the 
nominal interest rate increases one for one with inflation, while the real interest rate remains 
unchanged. 

Part II.   The Solow Model Revisited  

The Republic of Solowakia has the following production function: 
Y  = 
) =  AK αN 1−α , where α<1. 

,
(
N K F 
Let gA be the growth rate of A, gN be the growth rate of N, and δ be the rate of depreciation in 

this economy.


1. 	 Interpret the parameter A.  Empirically, what has happened to A over time? 

A is a technological parameter. It tells us how much output can be produced from given 
amounts of capital and labor at any time. (See page 244.) Although the book does not 
directly provide us with data on the parameter A, we see that the rate of growth of A (the rate 
of technological progress) given in Table 12-2 has been positive at least for years 1950-1987 
for France, Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US.  Over a longer period of time, the increase 
in A has been even more dramatic, taking into account the Agricultural Revolution and the 
Industrial Revolution. 

2. 	 Verify that the above production function has the property of constant returns to scale. 

We must verify that f(λK, λN) = λf(K, N), that is, if you multiply all inputs by a scalar, you 
will end up multiplying output by the same amount.

3. 	 Verify that the above production function is concave in capital (which means that the second 
derivative is negative). What does that mean in economics terms? 

∂

For this we must take the partial derivative of F(.) with respect to K.

( 
2∂K 
This means that this production function exhibits diminishing returns to capital (increases in 
capital lead to smaller and smaller increases in output as the level of capital increases). 

< 0  because α<1.  Therefore, F(.) is concave in K. 

4. 	 What is effective labor in this economy? 

Let’s rewrite the production func tion in the following fashion: 

1

1−α N )1−α

(
, 
N K F 
1 
~ 
Let’s redefine the technological parameter as  A =  A 1−α . (Note that we can do that, because A 
is just a constant in this model.) 
~ 
Then, effective labor is  N A 
. 

5.  At what rate do output and capital grow in Solowakia in the long run? (Hint: use  g A 
~  for the 
transformed gA.) 

We will first calculate the growth rates mathematically (you didn ’t have to do this). Let ’s 
~ 
) = K α (  N A  )1−α and take logarithms
(
, 
start with the transformed production function, 
N K F 
of both sides: 

~ 
A +  1(  − α log 
log Y  = α log K +  1(  − α log 
) 
) 
N


Taking the time derivative of the above equation, we get the following expression: 

~ 
∂ log Y  = α∂ log K  +  1(  − α ) 
∂ log A +  1(  − α ) 
∂ log N 
∂ t 
∂ t 
∂ t 
∂ t 
~ 
∂ log A 
∂ log Y 
~ 
is the growth rate of  A ,  g A 
~  ;
But 
∂ t 
∂ t 
∂ log N
∂ log K 
is the growth rate of capital (K), gK; and 
∂ t 
∂ t 

is the growth rate of output (Y), gY; 

is the population growth rate, gN. 

So, we have the following decomposition of output growth into growth driven by inputs and 

growth driven by technology: 


g  = α g  +  1(  − α )( g ~  + g N  )

Y
K 
A 

Because in steady-state we are on a balanced-growth path, we know that gY must equal gK. 

So we have, 

g  = α g  +  1(  − α )( g ~  + g N  )

Y

Output and capital both grow at the rate  g A 
~  + gN .  Intuitively, this is because the growth 
~  + gN . It cannot be gA+ gN , because we have transformed 
rate of effective labor equals  g A 
the A parameter. In the long run steady state, in this economy, what is constant is not output 
but rather output per effective worker. This implies that output grows at the same rate as 
effective labor. Same logic applies to capital. (See pages 247-248.)

As gN decreases (gN2 <gN1 ), less capital is required per effective worker, and therefore we

9. 	 Starting at the steady state in part 7 (point A), suppose the saving rate increases and the 
depreciation rate decreases at the same time. Use a diagram to analyze what happens in

state as point C.

Here we have a double shift.  A higher saving rate shifts the investment relation up. It follows 
that the steady-state level of capital per effective worker increases. A lower depreciation rate 
shifts out the required investment relation, which also leads to a higher steady-state capital 
per effective worker.

10. Starting at the steady state in part 7 (point A), suppose a neighboring country gives 
Solowakia a gift of new capital equipment. Use a diagram to analyze what happens in the 
long run. Label the new steady state capital per effective worker k4*. Label the new steady 
state as point D. 

If we were given a gift of capital, capital would (immediately) jump up to a level such as k ’ in 
the short-run.

However, in the long run, the dynamics will bring the economy back to the original steady-
state level of capital per effective worker, k1*. Why? When we receive the gift of capital, we 
end up at point D’, where
+δ
~  +
( 
g A
investment per effective 
worker equals the vertical 
D’ • 
distance OD’. The 
amount of investment 
required to maintain that 
level of capital per 
effective worker is clearly 
greater than the amount 
OD’. (Note that for all k> 
k1* the line 
(δ+ g ~  + g  )k  is above
N 
A
α 
the curve sk
.) Because 
investment that is 
required to maintain the 
existing level of capital 
per effective worker exceeds actual investment at D’, k decreases. Hence, starting from k’, 
the economy moves to the left, with the level of capital per effective worker decreasing over 
time. This continues until investment per effective worker is just sufficient to maintain the 
existing level of capital per effective worker, that is until we return to the initial steady-state, 
A.  (See page 248.) So, the effect of the gift will only be temporary (because nothing 
happened to investment or required investment).

Part III.   Expected Present Discounted Values  

1. 	 Suppose that the interest rate is 5% today and is expected to stay at 5% for the next three 
years. Calculate the present discounted value of a security that pays $10,500 in one year, 
$11,025 in two years, $23,152.5 in three years, and nothing thereafter.

It is not 10,500 + 11,025/1.05 +… because the security pays $10,500 not today, but a year 
from now. 
Note also that the fact that this security stops making payments after the first three years 
means that its maturity is 3 years. 

2. 	 Suppose the security in part 1 sells for $38,342.08 today. Would its discount rate need to be 
smaller or higher than 5%? Answer without computing it first. Then calculate the discount 
rate. Assume again that the interest rate is expected to remain the same for the next three 
years. 

If the security is sold at $38,342.08 (which is less than $40,000), the discount rate is higher 
than 5%.  Recall that the price of a bond (which is basically the same as present discounted 
value) and the interest rate move in opposite directions.

Note that this discount rate is called yield to maturity. It is the rate of return on cash flow of 
a security that is held until it matures (3 years). 

3. 	 What is the constant payment required to achieve the same present discounted value over 
three years as in part 2 (i.e. $38,342.08), at the same constant interest rate as you found in 
part 2?
