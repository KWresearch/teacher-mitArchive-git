14.02 Principles of Macroeconomics 

Problem Set 1   *Solution* 

Fall 2004


Part I.  True/False/Uncertain 
Justify your answer with a short argument. 

1.  From 1960 to 2000, the US, EU, and Japan all have experienced similar rates of 
unemployment.   

False.    

All three regions have experienced drastically different rates of unemployment.      
[Tables 1-1, 1-2, 1-3] tell us that the US average unemployment rate for 1960-2000 was 
6.1%, that of EU was 6.5%, and that of Japan was 2.0%.  Even though the average rates 
of unemployment were similar in the US and EU, figure 1-5 shows that the 
unemployment rates were actually very different over this period.   

2.	 GDP is the value of all goods and services produced in the economy. 

False.  (See page 22) 

GDP = Gross Domestic Product   

GDP = Value of * FINAL* goods & services produced in the economy.


3. 	 The Phillips Curve describes the negative relationship between the change in unemployment 
rate and inflation. 

False. 

Phillips Curve (Modified Phillips Curve) (page 32-33) → negative relationship between 
the unemployment rate & the CHANGE in inflation (When the unemployment rate is 
low, inflation tends to increase.) 

(We will revisit the Phillips Curve in chapter 8 again.) 

4. 	 Inflation is bad for the economy because goods and services are more expensive. 

Uncertain.  (page 33) 

Inflation usually leads to distortions because all prices and wages do not rise 
proportionately during inflationary periods.   So, inflation affects income distribution and 
may lead to uncertainties about the future which is considered not good.  (If all prices rise 
proportionally it is called pure inflation and it would just be a minor inconvenience.)  

5. The multiplier (Keynesian multiplier) is always greater than 1 if T = 0 and G = 0.   

True.  (page 52)

Goods Market Eqm  →  Y = C + I + G 

Y = [c0 + c1 Y - c1 T] + I + G 

1

Y =  [ 
1 − c1

]  [c0 +  I + G - c1 T ]

multiplier  → 

[

1
1 − c1

]

]  >1 

If 0 <  c1  < 1  → 

1
[ 
1 − c1
If the marginal propensity to consume is less than 1, it means that people consume less 
than 100% of their disposable income.   It also implies that the multiplier is greater 1.   
The fact that T = 0 and G = 0 is irrelevant. 

Part II.   NATIONAL ACCOUNTS (GDP, GDP DEFLATOR & CPI)

5.  Why are your answers in 2, 3 and 4 different/same? 

The answer to 2 differs from that of 3 and 4.  (page 24-26) 

Nominal GDP is the sum of quantities of final goods produced times their current price.  
Therefore, nominal GDP increases over time for 2 reasons.   
(1)  The production of goods increases over time (Quantity goes up) 
(2)  The price of most goods also increase over time (Prices goes up). 

Real GDP is constructed as the sum of the quantities of final goods times *constant* 
prices. (A base year is chosen).  So, it tells us how the quantity of finals goods changes 
over time.  Only the change in quantity affects real GDP.   

The answers to 3 and 4 are identical.  The base year chosen is sort of like a choice of unit 
of measurement.  For example, whether one measures one’s weight in pounds or 
kilograms does not affect one’s actual weight.   Therefore, the choice of base year, does 
not affect the growth of real GDP.    

6.  Compute inflation using GDP deflator (using 2000$) for 2002, 2003, 2004.

7.  Besides GDP deflator what other price indices are used in measuring inflation? 

(page 31-32) 

GDP Deflator = 

gives the average price of output  
(the final goods produced in the economy) 

CPI = 

Consumer Price Index 
Average price of consumption (goods people consume) 

PPI =  

 

Producer Price Index 
Prices of domestically produced goods in manufacturing, mining, 
agriculture, fishing, forestry, and electric utility industries.   

8.  Which one is the best?  Why? 

It is hard to say which one is better or more “correct ” in measuring inflation.  Each index 
gives us different information.  It depends mostly on what you are interested in knowing. 
If one wants to know how the price level of goods produced in the US is changing, then 
the GDP deflator would give the most accurate picture.  On the other hand, if one was 
interested in knowing how the price level of consumer goods was changing over time, 
then CPI would be the best.   

Part III.  THE GOODS MARKET 
(All units are millions of US dollars) 

C =  500 +(0.5)YD 
I  =  100 
T =  80 
G = 200 

1.  Solve for the good market equilibrium.  (Find equilibrium Y, Z, C, and YD.) 

Total demand:  

Good market equilibrium: 

So,  

Remember, 

Z = C + I + G 
Y = Z 
Y = C + I + G 
YD = Y – T 
( Y D = disposable income)  

Substituting in: 	
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Y = 500 + (0.5) (Y – 80) + 100 + 200 
Y = (0.5) Y + 760 
Y = 1520  (equilibrium output) 

YD = 1520  – 80 = 1440 

(disposable income) 

C = 500 + (0.5) (1440) 
C = 1220 (equilibrium consumption) 

Z = 1220 + 100 + 200  
Z = 1520 (total demand) 

2.  Graph (with correct labels) equilibrium Y and Z.

Y = Z (slope = 1)

3.	 Solve for private saving and public saving.   

(page 58-60) 

Private Saving :  

S = YD – C  = 1440 – 1220 = 220 

Public Saving :  

(T – G ) = (80 – 200) = -120  (Budget Deficit) 

Investment :  

I = S + (T – G ) = sum of private and public saving 
I = 220 – 120 = 100 

4.	 What is the value of marginal propensity to consume (mpc)?  What does it mean? 

(page 48-49) 
mpc = marginal propensity to consume gives the effect of an additional dollar of 
disposable income on consumption.  For example, if mpc = c1 = 0.3, this means that 
$0.30 of an additional $1 of disposable income will be consumed, and $0.70 will be 
saved. 

In this problem, mpc = c1 = 0.5.  For every $1 additional disposable income increase, 
$0.50 will be consumed. 

5.	 What is the value of marginal propensity to save (mps)? 

(page 59) 

mps = (1 – c 1) = marginal propensity to save  


6.	 What is the relationship between mpc and mps? 

mpc = 1- mps 

7.	 Find the multiplier and autonomous spending.  Explain what they mean.

Autonomous Spending  →  [c0 +  I + G - c1 T ] = 760 


Multiplier  → 

]  [c0 +  I + G - c1 T ]

Autonomous  spending  is  the  part  of  demand  for  goods  that  does  not  depend  on  output. 
The  multiplier  tells  us  how  much  equilibrium  output  will  change  for  a  given  change  in 
autonomous spending.  For example, if investment increases by 500, then the equilibrium 
output will rise by 1,000  (500 *2).   Why?   First,  investment  increases by 500.   Then,  this 
increase  in  I  increases  Z  (total  demand).   When  demand  increases,  production must  also 
increase  to  maintain  equilibrium.    This  means  that  Y  increases.    When  Y  increases,  Yd 
will  increase.   When  disposable  income  increases, C  increases.   C  increase will  result  in 
yet  a higher Z  since C  is a part of Z  (total demand).   But, when Z  increases, Y must also 
increase  to  match  it  if  in  equilibrium,  and  so  on.    This  process  continues.    (Please  see 
page 55 for detailed description) 

8.	 Now, the government is facing a reelection and increases G from 200 to 240 (Fiscal 
expansion).  Find the equilibrium demand, output, consumption, and disposable income, 
then graph.  Why would the government want to do so? 

When G increases by 40, then autonomous spending increases by 40.  Since the 
multiplier is 2, the equilibrium output will increase by 80.  Therefore, disposable income 
will rise by 80 and consumption will rise by 40 since mpc is 0.5.   

In an election year, the government might increase G since fiscal expansion leads to 
higher income (and higher disposable income) and this gives an impression of favorable 
economic performance which might win more votes.
