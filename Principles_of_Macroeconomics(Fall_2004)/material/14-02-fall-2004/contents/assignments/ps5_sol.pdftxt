Problem Set 5 Solutions 
Fall 2004 

Part I.  True/False/Uncertain 
Justify your answer with a short argument. 

1.  A higher saving rate alone can sustain higher growth of output forever. 

False.  A higher saving rate alone cannot sustain higher growth of output forever.  When the 
saving rate increases, output per worker increases until a new steady state is reached. Once the 
higher level of output per worker is reached (the new steady state), growth is equal to zero.  (See 
pages 225-228)   

2.  The golden-rule level of capital tells us that the highest level of consumption in steady-state is 
achieved when the saving rate is equal to 0. 

False.  An economy in which the saving rate is zero is an economy in which capital is equal to

zero.  In this case, output is also equal to zero, and so is consumption.   As saving rate increases, 

values of capital per worker, output per worker, and consumption per worker will also increase. 

However, if the saving rate is equal to 1, people save all their income, and consumption is also

equal to zero.  Therefore, the saving rate that maximizes the steady-state level of consumption is

somewhere between 0 and 1.

(See pages 229-230)   


3.  A flexible exchange rate regime is superior to a fixed exchange rate regime. 

Uncertain. (See chapter 21) 

Reasons against fixed exchange rate regime: 
First, countries that operate under fixed exchange rates and perfect capital mobility give up two 
macroeconomic instruments, the interest rate and the exchange rate (they give up monetary 
policy).  This not only reduces their ability to respond to shocks, but may also lead to exchange 
rate crises.  Second, the anticipation that a country that operates under a fixed exchange rate may 
have to devalue leads investors to ask for very high interest rates, making the economic situation 
worse, and putting more pressure on the country to devalue. 

Reasons for fixed exchange rate regime: 
When a group of economies are highly integrated, then adopting a common currency (fixed 
exchange rate regime) may be the right thing to do.  Even though countries ’ give up independent 
monetary policy (control of its own domestic interest rate), adopting a common currency (like 
the EU) maybe be advantageous since it cuts transaction costs of exchanging money.  In 
addition, international trade is much easier for buyers and sellers since goods are priced in the 
same currency.  This may spur competition among firms which benefits the consumers.  Another 
reason for adopting a fixed exchange rate is when a country needs to limit its own ability to use 
monetary policy in order to convince the market (the investors) to invest in within its borders.  

When a currency depreciates a lot, then, investors lose out since the return to their investment  

denominated in that currency loses value.  So, in order to attract investment, a country with a  

high inflation (which leads to real depreciation) may want to adopt a fixed exchange rate scheme  

such as a hard peg.


Reasons against flexible exchange rate regime:

Under a flexible exchange rate regime, the exchange rate may move a lot which may destabilize  

the economy too much.  Also, because of the J-curve effect, the adjustment process to medium-

run (long-run) equilibrium may take a while.  So, monetary or fiscal policies ’ effects may be 

delayed.  For example, when the central bank increases the nominal money supply to increase

output, in the short-run, Y may actually decrease before it starts to increase since NX may drop  

initially.   


Reasons for flexible exchange rate regime:

Independent monetary policy which allows the country to control its own domestic interest rate.

1. 
Suppose the economy is at point A where Y0 < YN.  If  E =  E , what happens to Y, NX, P, 
and  ε over time? Explain the intuition and also show graphically using IS-LM, AS-AD, and 
interest-rate parity curves.

At point A, Y0 < YN, so u0 > uN.  This means that the economy is not performing at its capacity.

So, people expect the price level to decrease in the near future.  When Pe decreases, W decreases

since the wage setting relation tells us that W = Pe  F(u,z).  A decrease in W decreases P since the

price setting relation tells us that P = (1+ µ ) W.  As Pe decreases AS shifts to the right and down.


What is happening to the IS-LM curves?

When P decreases, real exchange rate increases if E is fixed.  Real depreciation leads to a NX

increase.  This shifts the IS curve to the right.  Notice that at point C, the domestic interest rate 

has increased.  This means that E will have to decrease if interest-parity condition holds. 

However, the original premise of the question was that we were in a fixed exchange rate regime.

So, something must happen in order to preserve E at  E  when domestic demand increases as a  

result of real depreciation.  


A decrease in P also shifts LM curve down since a decrease in P increases the real money

supply.  (If the increase in real money supply due to a decrease in P is not enough to offset the

increase in interest rate, then the central bank has to increase the nominal money supply in order

to shift LM to LMMR.) 


This process continues until the economy reaches the MR/LR equilibrium where Y=YN and  

u=uN.  Point B is the medium-run (long-run) equilibrium.  Note that NX increase in this case.  A 

decrease in P is the same as an increase in the real exchange rate.  By Marshall-Lerner condition,

an increase in real exchange rate increases NX.


This is what happens if the central bank or the government does nothing (or only accommodates  

the change in IS) to speed up the process of adjustment to the medium-run equilibrium.  The

problem with this is that this adjustment may take a long time.  So, in the meanwhile, the 

economy is performing at under-capacity and the unemployment is high.  Therefore, there is an

incentive for the central bank and/or the government to act so that the adjustment process is

faster.  


2.  Now, suppose the central bank wants to intervene to speed up the adjustment process from 
point A to point C, the medium-run (long-run) equilibrium.   What can it do?  Explain with 
words and also show graphically. 

If a country has a credible fixed exchange rate system, then its announcement of a one-time 
devaluation is also credible.  So, the central bank can announce a one-time devaluation of its 
currency and is believed by the investors.  Credibility means that investors expect the exchange 
rate of this country to increase and be fixed at its new level.  So, Ee increases by the amount of 
the announcement.  This shifts the interest-rate parity condition curve to the right/up.  Since the 
central bank has not changed its money supply, today’s exchange rate increases to  E 2. 

When the exchange rate increases, then NX increases due to the Marshall-Lerner condition.  This 
means that the IS curve will shift to the right.  This also shifts the AD curve to the right and P 
starts to rise.  In a fixed exchange rate regime, monetary policy must accommodate.  The central 
bank now must increase the money supply so that the exchange rate does not change from  E 2. 
Notice how the central bank actually increases the money supply, so that the LM curve shifts to 
LM1, but the increase in P reduces the real money supply to LMMR curve level.
 (Note that if the 
central bank does nothing to the money supply, then the interest rate will change.)

Start at point A where P=Pe and Y=YN.  When G increases, IS shifts to the right.  In order to 
maintain a fixed exchange rate at E0, the central bank must increase Ms  when G increases.  There 
are two separate things happening here.  The central bank increases the nominal money supply. 
This shifts the LM curve to the right/down to LM1.  But, the IS curve is shifting to the right, 
which also shifts AD to the right.  This increases P.  This in turn decreases the real money supply 
and shifts the LM to the left a little (to LM2).  So, the short-run equilibrium is at point B where 
the IS1 and LM2 curves intersect. 

At point B (the short-run equilibrium), the economy is at over-capacity since YN < Y1.  This 
means that people expect the price level to increase.  This, in turn, increases W, which increases 
P.  When Pe  increases, 3 separate things happen all at once.  First, the AS curve shifts up and to 
the left.  Second, the LM curve shifts up and to the left also since the real money supply 
decreases as P increases. (The central bank has to decrease the nominal money supply if the 
decrease in the real money supply due to an increase in P is not enough to keep the domestic 
interest from changing.)   Third, the real exchange rate decreases (US dollar increases in value) 
even though E (the nominal exchange rate) is fixed when P increases.  By the Marshall-Lerner 
condition, we know that NX decreases.  This shifts the IS curve to the left.  (Note:  This shift of 
the IS curve does not affect AD since it was caused by the change in P.  P is on the axis of the 
AS-AD diagram, so this is a movement along the AD curve.).  So, the medium-run equilibrium is 
at point C where the AD1 and AS1  curves intersect and the IS0 and LM0 curves intersect. 

Part III.

 Solow Model of Growth 

Suppose that the production function is given by  Yt = 0.5  K t  N  .  

Assume that the size of the population, the participation rate, and the unemployment rate are all  

constant.    


1. 

Is this production function characterized by constant returns to scale?  Explain. 

Yes. 

If  λY = F(λK, λN), where λ is an arbitrary parameter, then we say that the production function 
is characterized by constant returns to scale.  This means that if we triple both the number of 
worker and the amount of capital in the economy, the output will triple also.

F (K, N) =  0.5
