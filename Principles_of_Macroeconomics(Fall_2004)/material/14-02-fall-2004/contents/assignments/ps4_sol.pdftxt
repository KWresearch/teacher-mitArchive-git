Part I.  True/False/Uncertain 
Justify your answer with a short argument. 

1. 	 High unemployment implies that the labor market is sclerotic. 

Uncertain.  The unemployment rate reflects two very different realities.  It may well point to 
a stagnant unemployment pool – a sclerotic market  with few separations and few hires.  
However, it may also reflect an active labor market, with many separations and many hires 
and with many workers entering and exiting unemployment. (See page 115.) 

2. 	 Patty lives in the US, and her salary at Widgets-R-Us is $25,000 per year. Suppose she is 
offered to move to France to work at a Widgets-R-Us franchise in Paris. Her new salary 
would be $35,000. Assume over the course of her move inflation in both countries will be 
zero, and Patty will not incur any moving costs or any other costs associated with going to 
France.  Assume also that the two jobs she will be doing are completely identical. Patty 
should move, because she is going to get a higher salary. 

Uncertain. People care about real wages, not nominal wages. What matters is not Patty ’s 
salary in dollars, but how much she can buy with what she earns in each country.  This is 
determined by the price level. If the price level in France is sufficiently higher than that in 
the US, Patty should stay. Note also that what matters is the expected price level.  Even 
though this problem assumes that inflation will be zero over the course of Patty’s transition 
to France, it is not known whether it will be zero thereafter.  If Patty expects the price level 
to increase more in the US relative to France in the future, she should go to France, even if 
the actual price level in France today is high relative to the US price level. 

3. 	 When output is below the natural level of output, the actual price level is lower than the 
expected price level. 

True.  The actual price level equals the expected price level when output is equal to the 
natural level of output. (See page 138.)  Because the AS curve is upward-sloping, if output is 
below its natural level, the actual price level is lower than expected.  See diagram:

4. 	 Suppose there is a decrease in the price level from P to P ’. Given the stock of nominal money, 
M, this leads to an increase in the real money stock, M/P, which shifts the LM curve down.  
This implies that the AD curve shifts to the right. 

False.  The first part of the statement is true: the decrease in the price level results in an 
increase of the real money stock, which leads to a decrease in the interest rate. (The LM 
shifts down and to the right, while the IS does not shift.)  The decrease in the interest rate 
leads to an increase in the demand for goods and an increase in output (Y to Y ’). Thus, 
because there is no shifts in the IS curve, the AD curve does not shift.  All we are doing here 
is moving along the AD curve.

5. 	 In terms of changing output, monetary policy is relatively more effective when the AS curve 
is relatively flat, while fiscal policy is more effective when the AS curve is relatively steep. 

False.  Monetary and fiscal policies affect the AD curve, not the AS curve.  Monetary and 
fiscal policies are both more effective in changing output when the AS curve is flatter and 

less effective when the AS curve is steeper. In the extreme case, when the AS curve is vertical, 
neither policy has any effect on output (the only effect of monetary and fiscal policy in this 
case is a change in the price level). 

6. 	 The neutrality of money means that monetary policy cannot affect output. 

False.  It is true that in the medium run, the increase in nominal money is reflected entirely 
in a proportional increase in the price level, and therefore the increase in nominal money 
has no effect on output or on the interest rate. However, the neutrality of money in the 
medium run does not mean that monetary policy cannot or should not be used to affect 
output: a monetary expansion can, for instance, help the economy move out of a recession 
and return faster to the natural level of output. In fact, in the short run, an increase in the 
money supply leads to an increase in output, an increase in the price level, and a decrease in 
the interest rate. What the term implies is that monetary policy cannot sustain higher output 
forever. (See page 147.)

Intuitively, for an increase in the price level, there is a decrease in the real money stock, 
which leads to an increase in the interest rate. The increase in the interest rate causes a 
decrease in the demand for goods, which leads to a decrease in output.  This implies that the 

relation between output and price is negative, which is exactly what the AD curve captures. 
(See page 139.)

4.  Suppose the aggregate supply takes the following form: P =

P=1. Assume we are in the short-run for now. What is the equilibrium output, Y*? What is 
the expected price level, Pe? Draw the AS-AD diagram.

Note that there was a typo in the expression for the AS curve here.  If the AS curve is

P = 
P  +  1(  /

)5.1(

when Y equals Yn. The AS curve should have been  P = P  +  1(  / 
)(50  Y  − Y  ) . Then, in the
e
n 
above calculation, P e  = 2 , and when Y=Yn, P=Pe=1. (If you used the AS as it is given to 
you, you will get full credit.)

The short-run equilibrium in this economy 
is at point A, where AS and AD intersect. 
At this point, the goods market, the 
financial market, and the labor market are 
all in equilibrium. If the equilibrium level 
of output equaled the natural level of 
output (and if the actual price level 
equaled the expected price level), the 
equilibrium would be at point B. Note that 
the equilibrium level of output is actually 
below the natural level of output in this 
economy (at point A). 

5. 	 The Keynesian government is up for reelection soon, and so it wants to achieve the natural 
level of output.  (We are still in the short run.) Propose two different policy options that 
would do the job.  For each policy option, draw the IS-LM and the AS-AD diagrams, and 
show how the first translates into the second. Calculate by how much the government must 
increase/decrease government spending to achieve the natural level of output. 

Policy Option 1: Expansionary Fiscal Policy 
If the government increases spending, the IS curve shifts right. Because price increases, the 
LM curve shifts up, and the interest rate increases even further. As a result of the fiscal 
expansion, the AD curve shifts out, and output increases to its natural level. The 
equilibrium is now at point B, where the actual price level equals the expected price level.

We know that at point B, Pe = 4/3 and the natural level of output we want to achieve is 550. 

Plugging into the AD equation: 

550 = (200+300+100+∆G)-200+100/(4/3) 

∆G = -50+200-75 

∆G = 75 

Government spending must increase by 75 million to close the gap. 


Again, if we use the proper expression for the AS here, we would have the following: 
550 = (200+300+100+∆G)-200+100/2 
∆G = -50+200-50 
∆G = 100 
Government spending must increase by 100 million to close the gap. 

Policy Option 2: Expansionary Monetary Policy

If the central bank increases the money supply, the LM curve shifts down from LM0 to LM1. 

But because the price has increased, the LM shifts back up from LM1 to LM2. As a result of 

the monetary expansion, the AD curve shifts out, and output increases to its natural level. 

The equilibrium is at point B, where the actual price level equals the expected price level.

Note that the only difference between the two policies is in their effect on the interest rate. 
Expansionary fiscal policy increases the interest rates, while expansionary monetary policy 
decreases it. (This difference is seen in the IS-LM diagrams – the AS-AD diagrams are 
identical for the two policy options.)

6. 	 The Keynesian government decides not to listen to you, and raises government spending by 
more than would be required to achieve the natural level of output. Its argument is that higher 
output is better. The voters apparently think so too, and the government gets reelected.  What 
happens as time passes and we get to the “medium run”? (You do not have to do any 
calculations, just draw diagrams and give some intuition.) 
When government spending increases 
by more than would be required to 
achieve the natural level of output, 
equilibrium output rises above the 
natural level of output (from Y0 to Y1). 
In the short-run, equilibrium goes from 
point A to point C. The actual price 
level is above the expected price level. 
So, the benefit of the fiscal expansion is 
that output has increased by more 
(instead of going from Y0 to Yn, it went 
from Y0 to Y1). On the flip side, the 
price level has also increased by more.

What happens in the medium run? As output exceeds the natural level of output at point C, 
the price level is higher than wage setters expected. They revise their expectations, causing 
the AS curve to shift up over time. Since agents expect higher prices in the future, nominal 
wages rise, which causes an increase 
in the actual price level. This higher 
price level leads to a decrease in the 
real money stock.  When the real 
money stock decreases, the interest 
rate rises, such that there is 
equilibrium in the money market. This 
results in a decrease in output.  This 
process continues until we go back to 
the natural level of output (until we are 
at point D). So, the increase in output 
over the natural level was only 
temporary. The only thing that the 
Keynesian government has 
accomplished is an even further 
increase in the price level. If it listened to us, the price level would have remained at Pe. 
(Note that in the medium run, output would have gone from Y0 to Yn even if the government 
did not enact any expansionary policy. In this medium-run model, the only thing the 
government can do is prevent the price level from rising even further.) (See pages 143-146.)

In this analysis, we will assume that the AD curve does not shift, as in the book (page 155). 
In the short run, the AS curve shifts up and the economy moves from point D to point E 
(remember that we are starting at 
point D, picking up from where we 
left off in part 6).  Output decreases 
from Yn1 to Y2. The increase in the 
price of oil leads firms to increase 
their price which decreases demand 
and output.
What happens over time? While 
output has decreased, the natural 
level of output has decreased even 
more (see pages 153-154) (Y2 is still 
above Yn2). Thus, the AS curve 
continues to shift up. (The fact that 
the actual price, P, is rising changes 
the expected price level, Pe, which in 
turn changes P and so on. That is why the AS is shifting up and to the left and that is why the 
natural level of output has decreased from Yn1 to Yn2.) The final equilibrium is at point F. 
We can conclude that bad macroeconomic policies adopted by the Keynesian government, 
coupled with the worldwide increase in the price of oil, led to a decrease in output and a 
dramatic increase in the price level in the Republic of Keynesia (a phenomenon that is 
typically referred to as stagflation).

Part III.   The Phillips Curve 

Suppose the Phillips curve is given by π = π  +  2.0  − 5u t where π

t − 1

1. 	 What is the natural rate of unemployment in this economy? 

The natural rate of unemployment is defined as the rate of unemployment when the actual 
price equals the expected price, Pt = Pt  , or alternatively, πt = πt . 

e	
e
Therefore, we have 0=0.2 - 5un.

So, un=4%.


2. 	 For now assume that θ=0. (What does that mean?) Suppose that the government decides to 
lower unemployment to 3% and keep it there forever.  What is the rate of inflation for t=100? 
Is this realistic? Why? 

Since θ=0, πt  =0. (This means that agents in the economy ignore past inflation and assume 
e
that this year’s price level is  roughly the same as last year’s pr ice level.  This is a reasonable 
assumption as long as inflation is low and not very persistent. (See page 167.)) 

πt =0.2-5(0.03) Îπt =0.05 

So, if unemployment is kept at 3% forever, inflation will be 5% forever. In particular, it will 
be 5% in t=100. This is not a very realistic model.  Inflation expectations are zero in every 
period, but actual inflation is 5%.  This means that every period people underestimate the 
rate of inflation.  It would be more realistic if expectations changed, depending on what the 
actual inflation rate is. 

3. 	 Assume that only for the first three periods (t=1, t=2, and t=3) people form their expectations 
using θ=0. After the third period, from t=4 on, they start using θ=1 forever. Also, the 
government still wants to keep unemployment at 3%.  What is the rate of inflation for t = 4, 5, 
and 6? What is the expected rate of inflation for t=4, 5, and 6? Is this setup more realistic? Why? 

πt  –  π t-1 =0.2 – 5(0.03)=0.05 (Inflation goes up every period by 5%.) 
π3 =0.05 
π4 = 0.1 Îπ4 
e=0.05 
π5 =0.15Îπ5 
e=0.1 
π6 =0.2Îπ6 
e=0.15 
This is a more realistic setup, because expectations adapt to inflation behavior.  For 
example, in period 4, people expect inflation to be 0.05, but it is actually 0.1.  So, for the next 
period, people adjust their expectations to be 0.1. However, inflation expectations are always 
lagging behind actual inflation, and people are still constantly underestimating inflation.
