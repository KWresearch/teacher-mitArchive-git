Part I.  True/False/Uncertain 
Justify your answer with a short argument. 

1. 	 Suppose interest rates for a one-period deposit are 5% in the US (the home country) and 2% 
in Canada. Assume that the risk premium in Canada is the same as in the US. This implies 
that the investor should invest in the US. 

2. 	 Dan (a US citizen) pays $160,000 in cash to a US Mercedes Benz dealer for a 2005 SL500 
Roadster. The dealer then pays $150,000 to Mercedes Benz of Germany. Mercedes deposits 
$150,000 in its US bank account. This transaction has increased the US capital account 
surplus. (Assume there is no statistical discrepancy.) 

3. 	 Following a real depreciation, the trade balance necessarily improves. 

4. 	 Consider the Mundell-Flemming model of a small open economy. If the government 
increases taxes, the exchange rate will depreciate.  (Assume taxes are lump-sum, not 
proportional.) In order to bring the exchange rate down to its original level, the Fed should 
expand the money supply. 

5. 	 Compared to the closed economy, a given increase in government spending will cause a 
larger increase in output in the open economy with flexible exchange rates. (Assume that the 
two economies start in equilibrium.) 

6. 	 In an open economy, fiscal policy is more effective than (or at least as effective as) monetary 
policy. 

Part II.   The Goods Market in a Two-Country Model

   Consider two open economies, Blanchardostan and the Republic of Caballeria.  Assume that 
these countries only trade with each other. Variables with subscript B and variables with 
subscript C correspond to Blanchardostan and the Republic of Caballeria, respectively. The two 
economies are characterized by the following set of equations: 

Ci = c0i + c1i(Yi -Ti) where i = B or C (B for Blanchardostan and C for Caballeria) 
Ii = I 
Gi = G i

Ti = tiYi

IMi = im0i + im1iYi

ε = 1 


1. 	 Derive the expression for equilibrium output YB as a function of GB and YC (Note that YC is 
exogenous from the perspective of Blanchardostan.) Similarly, derive the expression for YC. 

2. 	 Let: c0B = c0C = 200 
c1B = c1C = 0.5 

I  = 250 

GB= 114 

GC=120 

tB= tC = 0.4 

im0B = im0C = 40 

im1B = 0.05 

im1C = 0.3 

ε = 1 

All figures are in millions of US dollars. 


Calculate the equilibrium levels of output in the two countries. 

3. 	 Calculate the trade balance (i.e. the current account) for each country.  Is there a trade/current 
account deficit or surplus in Blanchardostan? In the Republic of Caballeria? 

4. 	 Draw a diagram to show equilibrium output and net exports for Blanchardostan. Label the 
B and the output at which there is trade balance, YTB . 
B
equilibrium output Y0

5. 	 Suppose the government of Blanchardostan wants to increase government spending by 147 
million.  What will be the new equilibrium output levels in the two economies?  What is the 
multiplier in Blanchardostan? 

6. 	 Assume that exports are exogenously given from now on. What is the open economy 
multiplier in Blanchardostan? Suppose the two economies decide to close.  What is the 
multiplier in Blanchardostan now, assuming all the other figures remained the same? 
Compare the different multipliers that you found in parts 5 and 6.  

Part III.   Fixed Exchange Rates 

Consider a small open economy (call it Mundellia) which obeys our Mundell-Flemming 
model and is the domestic country. Assume that it has a credible fixed exchange rate regime 
and starts out in equilibrium. Assume that for Mundellia, US represents “the rest of the 
world.” 

1.	 Use intuition and diagrams to explain what happens in Mundellia as a result of the following 
changes. 
a.	 There is an increase in consumer confidence in Mundellia. 
b.	 The US Fed decreases money supply. 

2.	 Discuss the pros (if any) and cons (if any) of the Mundellian fixed exchange rate regime. 
(Use intuition and your analysis in part 1 to answer this question.)
