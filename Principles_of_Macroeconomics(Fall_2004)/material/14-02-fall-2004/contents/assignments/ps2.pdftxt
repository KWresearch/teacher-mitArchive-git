Part I.  True/False/Uncertain 
Justify your answer with a short argument. 

1. 	 Paradox of saving occurs when the attempts by people to save more lead to a decline in output 
and an increase in saving.   

2. 	 When mpc increases and investment decreases, goods market equilibrium output increases. 

3. 	 If investment is really sensitive to changes in the interest rate (b1 large), then IS is flatter and 
fiscal policy is more effective.  (assume:   I = b0 – b 1i ) 

4. 	 The price of bonds increases when the interest rate rises. 

5. 	 Monetary contraction and fiscal expansion together lead to an increase equilibrium output and 
interest rate.   

6. 	 The money multiplier is always less than 1.  

Part II.   THE MONEY MARKET 
(all units are trillions of US $) 

Money Demand:    Md = $Y (0.2 – i) 
$Y = 2000 
Nominal Income:  
Ms = 300 
Money Supply: 

1. 	 Find  Md  for i = 10% and i = 5%. 

2. 	 What is the relationship between i and Md. 

3. 	 Graph Ms  and Md and calculate the equilibrium i. 

4. 	 Alan Greenspan decreases Ms by 50.   
What happens to money market equilibrium?  (solve  &  graph ) 

5. 	 Describe how the Fed changes i in the US.   

Part III.  Money Multiplier 

Checkable deposits:  Dd  = $900 billion 
Total money supply:  Ms = $1800 billion 
θ = 0.2 
Reserve ratio:   
Ratio of (CUd / Md) :  c = 0.5 

1. 	 Find CUd , Rd and Dd. in equilibrium.   
2. 	 Find the money multiplier. 

3. 	 Describe 2 different ways the Fed can decrease money supply. 

4. 	 If the Fed wants to decrease the money supply by $500 million (in order to raise i), what 

amount of bonds would it have to sell/buy? 

Part IV.  IS - LM 
(All units are millions of US dollars) 

C =  200 +(0.25)YD 
I  =  150 + 0.25Y - 1000 i 
T = 200 
G =  250 
(M/P)s  =  1600 
(M/P)d  =  2Y – 8000 i 

1.	 Find the equation for aggregate demand (Z). 

2.	 Derive the IS equation. 

3.	 Derive the LM equation. 

4.	 Solve for equilibrium real output, interest rate, C and I. 

5.	 Graph the IS-LM diagram of the above with correct labels. 

6.	 Monetary expansion:                                                                                                            
Let Ms (nominal money supply) increase to 1840.  Find equilibrium Y, i, C and I.
 What 
happens to Y, i, C and I when the Fed increases money supply through open market 
operations? 
7.	 Graph part 6 (a new graph starting from part 5). 

8.	 Fiscal expansion:  (Continue from part 5) 
Let G increase to 400.  Find equilibrium Y, i, C and I.  What happens to equilibrium Y, i, 
C and I when government spending increases? 

9.	 Graph part 8 (a new graph starting from part 5).  

10.  There is a sudden drop in consumer confidence and c0 drops from 200 to 100.  How can 
the government counterbalance the drop in GDP using government spending as a policy 
instrument?
