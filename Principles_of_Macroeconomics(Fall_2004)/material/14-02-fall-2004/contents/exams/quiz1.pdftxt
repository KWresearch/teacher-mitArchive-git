7:30 PM – 9 PM  


Please,  answer  the  following  questions. Write  your  answers  directly  on 
the  quiz.  You  can  achieve  a  total  of  100  points.    There  are  10 multiple-
choice  questions,  followed  by  2  free  response  questions  (one  weighted 
50/100  points  and  one  weighted  20/100  points).  You  should  read  all  of 
the questions first.  There is a blank page attached at the end of the quiz 
to be used for scratch paper. 

Good Luck!

Multiple-Choice Questions (30/100 points) 

Please, circle the correct answer for each of the following 10 multiple-choice questions.  
For each question, only one of the answers is correct.  Each question counts 3/100 points. 

1)  Consider two economies that are identical, with the exception that one has a high 
marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and one has a low MPC.  If the money supply is 
increased by the same amount in each economy, the high MPC economy will experience 

A)  A larger increase in output and a smaller decrease in the interest rate. 

B)  A smaller increase in output and a smaller decrease in the interest rate. 

C)  A larger increase in output and a larger decrease in the interest rate. 

D)  A smaller increase in output and a larger decrease in the interest rate. 

E)  None of the above. 


2)  Which of the following policy options would simultaneously increase interest rates 
and decrease output? 

A)  The Federal Reserve Board sells bonds through open market operations. 

B)  The federal government increases its defense purchases. 

C)  The Federal Reserve Board expands the money supply.

D)  The federal government increases the tax rate. 

E)  Actions described in both A) and D). 


3)  Suppose an economy is running a government budget deficit. Assume that C = c0 + 
c1(Y-T).  Which one of the following will cause this deficit to become larger? 

A)  Expansionary monetary policy. 

B)  An increase in exports.

B) The pound is expected to appreciate with respect to the dollar. 

C) The interest rate in the US is expected to increase. 

D) The interest rate in the US is expected to decrease.

5)  Consider a small economy where the total population is 10,000. The size of the labor 
force is 8,000, while the number of people employed is 7,000. What is the unemployment 
rate in this economy? 

A)  10% 

B)  12.5% 

C)  20% 

D)  30% 

E)  37.5% 


6)  Assume that C = c0 + c1(Y-T). Suppose that taxes increase and money supply 
increases in such a way that output is constant in equilibrium (assume c1<1). These policy 
changes will produce: 

A)  An increase in investment and a decrease in private consumption. 

B)  An increase in investment and a decrease in government spending. 

C)  An increase in investment and an increase in private saving. 

D)  A decrease in investment and an increase in public saving. 

E)  Uncertain. 


7)  In 2000, the nominal GDP growth of a country was 8% and the real GDP growth was 
4%.  What was the rate of inflation for this country? 

A)  - 4% 

B)  2% 

C)  4% 

D)  8% 

E)  12% 


8)  Suppose the United States has no exports. The only imports of the US are 200 
Mercedes Benz cars worth US$50,000 each from Germany. Germany has no imports and 
only exports those 200 cars to the US. Neither the US nor Germany trade with any other 
countries or engage in any transactions with other countries. Which one of the following 
statements must be true? 

A)  The US has a capital account deficit. 

B)  Germany has a current account deficit. 

C)  Germans are buying US assets. 

D)  The exchange rate of US Dollars per Euros (the currency in Germany) is 

bigger than 1. 

E)  None of the above.

9)  Suppose that investment (I) in the goods market is not responsive to the interest rate 
(that is, I does not depend on the interest rate at all). Then 

A)  The IS curve is a vertical line and monetary policy is very effective in raising 
output. 
B)  The IS curve is a horizontal line and monetary policy is very effective in 
raising output. 
C)  The IS curve is a vertical line and monetary policy does not affect output in 
the IS-LM model. 
D)  The IS curve is a horizontal line and monetary policy does not affect output in 
the IS-LM model. 
E)  The IS curve still has a negative slope, but monetary policy monetary policy 
does not affect output in the IS-LM model. 

10)  An increase in the money supply and a drop in consumer confidence will lead to 

A)  A decrease in output with an ambiguous effect on the interest rate. 

B)  An increase in output and a decrease in the interest rate. 

C)  A decrease in output and an increase in the interest rate. 

D)  An ambiguous effect on output and an increase in the interest rate. 

E)  An ambiguous effect on output and a decrease in the interest rate.

Free Response Question I (50/100) 

The Republic of Keynesia is a closed economy and obeys our short-run IS-LM model. 
Assume it starts out in equilibrium in both the goods market and the money market.  
Keynesia’s economy is described by  the following set of equations: 

Goods market: 
•	 C = c0 + c1(1-t)Y, where C is consumption; Y is income; t represents a 

proportional tax; and c0 and c1 are positive constants 

I = b0 – b 1i, where I is investment; i is the interest rate; and b0 and b1 are positive 
constants 
__ 
__ 
•	 G =  G , where  G  is a positive constant  

•	

Money market: 
•	 Md = P(m0 + m1Y – m 2i), where Md is money demand; P is the price level; m0 (a 
positive constant) represents exogenous changes to Md; and m1 and m2 are also 
positive constants 
•	 Let Ms represent money supply 

1.  Combine the goods market equations to derive an expression for Y as a function 
of i (i.e. derive the IS curve). Give the definition of the IS relation. (7 points)

2.	 Use the money market equations to express i as a function of Y (i.e. derive the 
LM curve).  Give intuition for why the LM curve slopes upward/downward. (7 
points) 

3.	 Graph the IS and the LM curves on the same diagram, putting i on the vertical 
axis and labeling the curves.  Label the equilibrium interest rate and output, i0 and 
Y0, respectively. (7 points)

4.	 Suppose the government increases its spending by ∆ G . Which curve will shift, if 
any?  Calculate by how much it will shift and draw a diagram that shows the 
impact of this policy. (9 points) 

i 

Y 

5.	 What will happen to investment as a result of the government policy described in 
part 4? (You do not need to calculate anything, just give intuition.) (5 points)

6.	 Suppose that the government decides to cut taxes instead of increasing spending. 
Analyze the effects of this expansionary fiscal policy using a diagram. (You do 
not need to calculate anything, just draw the diagram.) (5 points)

Y

7.	 Using the IS-LM model, explain what can be done to offset the changes in the 
interest rate caused by increased government spending and, at the same time, keep 
output from declining. (In other words, suggest a way to bring the interest rate 
back to the level it was at before the policy in part 4 took place without causing a 
reduction in output). (10 points)
