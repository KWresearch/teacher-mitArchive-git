Please, answer the following questions. Write your answers directly on the quiz. You 
can achieve a total of 100 points.  There are 5 multiple-choice questions, followed by 
2 long questions (both weighted 40/100 points).  You should read all of the questions 
first.    There  is  a  blank  page  attached  at  the  end  of  the  quiz  to  be  used  for  scratch 
paper. 

Good Luck!

Multiple-Choice Questions (20/100 points) 

Please, circle the correct answer for each of the following 5 multiple-choice questions.  
For each question, only one of the answers is correct.  Each question counts 4/100 points. 

1)  Consider the wage-setting and price-setting equations we studied in class. Suppose the 
markup, µ, equals 0.25, and F(u,z) = 1-u. What is the natural rate of unemployment in 
this economy? 

A)  0.2 

B)  0 

C)  0.25 

D)  0.1 

E)  0.5 


2)  In the medium-run/long-run, a decrease in the budget deficit will produce:  

A)  No effect

B)  An increase in investment 

C)  An increase in consumption 

D)  A decrease in output 

E)  No effect on the price level


3)  Suppose that workers in the Republic of Communia are highly unionized, while 
workers in the Republic of Individuela are not. In all other respects, the two countries are 
exactly the same. Which statement is true? 

A)  Communia is likely to have a higher natural level of output than Individuela. 

B)  Communia is likely to have a higher natural rate of unemployment than Individuela. 

C)  Wages are probably lower in Communia than in Individuela. 

D)  In the short-run, the price level is always lower in Communia than in Individuela. 

E)  In the short-run, output is always higher in Communia than in Individuela.

that only for the first two periods (t=1 and t=2) people form their expectations using θ=0. 
From t=3 on, they start using θ=1 forever. Assume that the government still wants to 
keep unemployment at 2%.  What is the expected rate of inflation for t=4? 

A)  2% 
B)  4% 
C)  8% 
D)  12% 
E)  16% 

5)  You observe that the domestic interest rate increases from 5% to 15%, and you are in 
a credible fixed exchange rate system, then this implies that 

A)  The level of the international interest rate increased by 5% 
B)  Agents are expecting a nominal appreciation of 5% 
C)  Agents are expecting a nominal depreciation of 5% 
D)  Both A) and B) 
E)  Both A) and C)

Long Question I (40/100 points) 
Open Economy IS-LM 

Assume that the economy is described by the following model: 

•	

•	 C = c0 + c1(Y–T), where C is consumption; Y is  income; T represents taxes; and 
c0 and c1 are positive constants 
I = b1Y– b 2i, where I is investment; i is the interest rate; and b1 and b2 are positive 
constants 
__ 
__ 
•	 G =  G , where  G  is a positive constant  
•	
IM = im1Y, where IM is imports; and im1  is a positive constant 
•	 X = x1Y* , where X is exports; Y* is foreign income (exogenous); and x1 is a 
positive constant 
•	 The LM equation in this economy is i = (1/m2)(m1Y – M s), where Ms is money 
supply; and m1 and m2 are positive constants 
•	 Let P*=P=1 

Assume that the Marshall-Lerner condition is satisfied (that is, following a depreciation 
of the exchange rate, the trade balance improves). 

Part I. Fixed Exchange Rate. 

Assume for now that the real exchange rate is fixed at one (ε = 1). Assume that the 
interest rate parity condition holds, and the interest rate in the foreign country is i*. 

1.	 Find the expression for equilibrium income. (3 points)

2.  Calculate the change in output (Y), net exports (NX), the domestic interest rate (i), 
and the real exchange rate if taxes increase by ∆T. Also, draw a diagram. (6 points) 

3.	 Calculate the effect of a change in foreign output (Y*) on domestic output (Y), net 
exports (NX), the domestic interest rate (i), and the real exchange rate. (Assume 
+ b  < 1 .) (6 points)

4.	 Suppose the Central Bank implements expansionary monetary policy. What effect 
will this have on output (Y), net exports (NX), the domestic interest rate (i), and the 
real exchange rate. Also draw a diagram. (5 points) 

6 

Part II. Flexible Exchange Rate. 

Assume that the exchange rate is allowed to float, the interest rate parity condition holds, 
and that Ee =1. 

5.	 What is the effect on output (Y), net exports (NX), the domestic interest rate (i), and 
the real exchange rate if taxes increase? Use intuition and draw a diagram (no 
calculations required). (5 points) 

7 

6.	 What is the effect of an increase in foreign output on domestic output (Y), net exports 
(NX), the domestic interest rate (i), and the real exchange rate? Use intuition and 
draw a diagram (no calculations required). (5 points) 

7.	 What is the effect of an increase in the money supply on output (Y), net exports (NX), 
the domestic interest rate (i), and the real exchange rate? Use intuition and draw a 
diagram (no calculations required). (5 points)

8.	 Suppose that investors’ expectations of the future exchange rate increase (E e increases). 
However, the Central Bank does not want the exchange rate to depreciate today. What 
effect will this have on the economy (no calculations required)? Draw a diagram.        
(5 points)

Explain. (5 points)
