Fall 2004 

Multiple-Choice Questions 

1)  According to the article, what is the main reason investors in US government bonds 
grow less optimistic? 

A)  They are concerned about the decline (depreciation) of the dollar, which, in the 
long run, leads to an increase in the price level. 
B)  They are expecting high inflation due to rising oil prices, which would lead to a 
fall in real interest rates in the future, despite the Fed ’s tightening. 
C)  Because the Fed is in “tightening mode, ” due to reports of higher job creation and 
evidence of low inflation, and thus they expect the price of bonds to decrease. 
D)  Because the Fed is in “tightening mode, ” due to reports of higher job creation and 
evidence of low inflation, and thus they expect the price of bonds to increase. 
E)  Both A) and D). 

Answer: C). The investors are growing more bearish because the Fed is likely to keep 
raising interest rates despite the decline of the dollar.  The fact that job creation has 
picked up and that inflation is not a problem at the moment points to the 
strengthening of the economy.  So, there is no reason for the Fed to stop tightening.  
What happens if interest rates rise? We know from the textbook chapter on valuation 
of securities that bond prices are inversely related to interest rates. As interest rates 
increase, treasuries lose their value (their prices decrease).  This might seem good 
from a perspective of a buyer of a bond.  But remember that the treasuries investors 
in the articles are already holding the securities!  Obviously, they are not happy 
about the decrease in the value of their holdings. 

2)  The report says that “A Bloomberg News survey last week showed that most experts 
expected the Fed to raise the target level for overnight loans between banks to 2.25 
percent from 2 percent on Dec. 14. A month ago, only a few forecast an increase in 
the federal funds rate.” This  information implies the valuation of any assets (hint: use 
the formula for EPDV discussed in class and assume nothing else changes in reaction 
to what the Fed does): 

A)  Will decrease on Dec. 14 if the Fed increases the target level to 2.25 percent. 

B)  Will decrease on Dec. 14 if the Fed raises the target level to 2.50 percent. 

C)  Have decreased from last month to today.

D)  Both A) and C). 

E)  Both B) and C). 


Answer: E). V is a negative function of ie(t+s). The report suggests that ie has 
increased during the last month and is expected to increase on Dec. 14, therefore V 
has decreased during the last month (thus, option C) is correct) , if the Fed increases 
the interest rate as expected nothing else will change (therefore A) is not correct). 

And if the Fed increases the interest rate by more than expected, assets prices will 
decrease again (thus B) is also correct). Then, the correct answer is E). 

3) 	 The article reports that the dollar weakened 3.9% against the euro over the last month. 
If the dollar continues to weaken, we should expect (assume that the Marshall-Lerner 
condition holds) 

A)  Exports from the US to Europe to increase. 

B)  US imports from Europe to increase. 

C)  The US trade balance with Europe to deteriorate. 

D)  Both A) and C). 

E)  Both B) and C). 


Answer: A). The depreciating dollar will weaken the purchasing power of US 
consumers vis-à-vis European goods, which w ill lead to a decline in imports. The US 
trade balance will improve under Marshall-Lerner conditions as a result of higher 
exports and lower imports. 

4) 	 The article mentions the  “China Scare, ” stating that “US government bonds fell on 
Nov. 26 after China Business News reported Yu Yongding, a Chinese central bank 
official, said China had cut its holdings of U.S. debt. Why did the price of US 
government bonds fall as a reaction to the news from China? 

A)  The demand for dollars declined which has to lead to an increase in current US 
interest rates. 
B)  The demand for dollars declined which has to lead to an increase in current and 
future US interest rates. 
C)  US interest rates are expected to rise to prevent the US from running into 
problems with financing its trade deficit. 
D)  The Fed will have to raise interest rates to prevent the US government from 
selling its bonds. 
E)  Bankers in New York were worried that the report was actually distorted which 
leads to uncertainty about the true demand for dollars. 

Answer: C). When a country has a trade deficit, it needs to borrow funds from abroad 
to finance this deficit. The fact that China holds U.S. government bonds helps to 
finance the U.S. trade deficit. For example, the U.S. buys more goods from China 
than China buys from the U.S. and thus transfers more dollars to China than the 
Chinese need to buy U.S. goods. China accepts these additional dollars since they use 
them to buy U.S. government bonds (that is the U.S. borrows this money from China 
since bonds are just IOUs). If China suddenly decides that it wants to buy fewer U.S. 
government bonds, the U.S. won’t be able to borrow as much from China, unless the 
U.S. increases the interest rate on government bonds. Increasing the interest rate 
would make U.S. government bonds more attractive as an investment since they 
would pay a higher return. 

Long Question I (35/100 points) 
Open Economy AS-AD and Growth 

Assume that the economy is described by the following set of equations.

Wage Setting:        W = Pe Ae F(u,z) 

AD: 

Y= C(Y, T) + I (Y,i) + G + NX (Y, Y*,  ε ) 

Assume that the Marshall-Learner Condition is satisfied. 

1.	

 Suppose the economy is at a place where u < uN (point Q).   Assume that A and Ae 
are constant. Without fiscal policy and monetary policy interventions, what happens 
over time?  Show graphically.  Label all curves.   Label the medium-run equilibrium 
as point M clearly.

At point Q, Y0 > YN, so u0 < uN.  This 
means that the economy is at a level 
that is beyond its capacity.  So, people 
expect the price level to increase in the 
near future.  When Pe increases, W 
increases since the wage setting 
relation tells us that W = PeAeF(u,z). 
An increase in W increases P since the 
price setting relation tells us that P = 
(1+ µ ) (W/A).  As P increases, the AS 
curve shifts to the left and up.  At the 
same time, LM shifts up, because an 
increase in P decreases the real money 

supply even though the Fed is not decreasing nominal money supply.  This process 
continues until the economy reaches point M which is the medium-/long-run 
equilibrium where Y=YN and u=uN. 

2.	

If the central bank announces a one-time revaluation of its currency that is credible, 
what happens over time?  Still, assume that A and Ae are constant. Show graphically.  
Label all curves.   Label the medium-run equilibrium as point M clearly.

If a country has a credible fixed 
exchange rate system, then its 
announcement of a one-time 
revaluation is also credible.  So, if the 
central bank announces a one-time 
revaluation of its currency, it is 
believed by the investors.  Credibility 
means that investors expect the 
exchange rate of this country to 
decrease and be fixed at its new level.  
So, Ee decreases by the amount of the 
announcement.  This shifts the 
interest-rate parity condition curve to 
the left/down.  Since the central bank 
has not changed the nominal money 
supply, today’s exchange rate increases to  E 1 and i=i*.

When the exchange rate decreases, net exports (NX) decrease due to the Marshall-
Lerner condition. This means that the IS curve will shift to the left.  This also shifts 
the AD curve to the left, and P starts to fall.  In a fixed exchange rate regime, 
monetary policy must accommodate.  The central bank now must decrease the money 
supply so that the exchange rate does not deviate from  E 1.  Notice that the central 
bank actually decreases the money supply, so that the LM curve shifts to LM1, but the

3.	 What is the advantage of government intervention, namely one-time revaluation of 
the domestic currency in question 2, if the speed of adjustment from point Q to the 
medium-run equilibrium was the same as in question 1? Limit your answers to a few 
sentences. 

The main difference between the medium-run equilibrium of question 1 and 2 is the 
equilibrium price.  Even if the speed of adjustment is the same (usually the adjustment 
in question 2 is faster), the medium-run equilibrium price is higher if the government 
(and the central bank) does not intervene.  This means that inflation is higher under 
the scenario in question 1.  This problem of inflation does not exist with one-time 
revaluation. 

4.	 Now, the economy is at the medium/long-run equilibrium (point M) but it 
experiences an increase in productivity.  What happens to its natural rate of 
unemployment if people’s expectations a bout prices and productivity are correct? 
Why? Show graphically.  Label all curves.

When this economy experiences 
an increase in productivity, 
nothing happens to its natural rate 
of unemployment.  This is because 
both the PS schedule and the WS 
schedule shift up by the same 
amount.  Why by the same 
amount?  It is because people’s 
expectations of productivity are 
equal to the actual productivity 
improvement.  The WS curve shifts 
up because an increase in Ae 
increases W and this increases the 
real wage (W/P).  The PS curve 
shifts up because an increase in A 
means that P decreases since less labor is required for production.  The decrease in P 
increases the real wage.

experiences an increase in productivity which does not affect AD.  If people’s 
expectations about productivity are always correct, what happens in the short- and 
medium-run?  Show graphically.  Label all curves.  Label short- and medium-run

In the short-run: 
When productivity increases (an increase in A), the AS curve shifts down and to the right.  
This lowers P which has 2 effects.  First, the real money supply increases even though the 
nominal money supply has not changed.  This shifts the LM curve down.  At the same 
time, a decrease in P leads to a real depreciation of the domestic currency.  This 
increases net exports due to the Marshall-Lerner condition.  So, the IS curve shifts to the 
right also.  The intersection of IS-LM must be at point M’.  Why?  A fixed exchange 
regime means that i = i* and E =  E .  (Note:  If the decrease in P is not enough (or too 
much) to increase real money supply which would correspond to LMSR, then the central 
bank must either increase (or decrease) nominal money supply so that i=i* is 
maintained, since that’s what it means  to be in a fixed exchange regime. ) 

Another important point here is that with a higher A (productivity), does not change the 
natural rate of unemployment since people ’s expecations were correct.  However, u=1-
(Y/AL).  So, even though uN is constant, YN increases.   

Short-run to medium-run: 
At point M’, the economy is performing at a level below that of  the natural level of 
output.  So, people’s expectations of prices start to decrease.  As P e decreases, the AS 
curve starts to shift to the right/down until it reaches point M’
’.  As the AS curve moves 
toward point M’
’, the actual  price level also drops.  This increases real money supply 
(the LM curve shifts down) and the real exchange rate (IS shifts right).  Again, since i=i* 
at all times, we know that at point M ’
’, th e IS and the LM curves must intersect, and the 
AS and the AD curves must also intersect.

economy, and s is the saving rate.

This says that the optimal level of savings is equal to the share of capital in the 
production function, α . The intuition is that diminishing returns reduce the usefulness 
of additional units of capital, so investing more is not always optimal. 

4. 	 Suppose that at time t there is a one-time inflow of foreign workers into the country, so 
that N jumps from N0 to N1. (Assume that this does not affect gN.) Draw two diagrams: 
one showing what happens to the investment and required investment schedules, 
including dynamics, and one depicting the effects of this inflow on capital per worker 
over time. 

An inflow of foreign workers is equivalent to an increase in N.  Therefore, K/N 
decreases (k decreases).  So, in this case, capital per worker would (immediately) 
jump down to a level such as k’ in the short-run. However, in the long run, the 
dynamics will bring the economy back to the original steady-state level of capital per 
effective worker, k1*. Why? When there is an increase in N, we end up at point E’, 
where investment per worker equals the vertical distance E’k’. The amount of 
investment required to maintain that level of capital per worker is clearly smaller 
than the amount E’k’ (distance Dk’). Bec ause actual investment exceeds investment 
that is required to maintain the existing level of capital per worker at E’, k increases. 
Hence, starting from k’, the economy moves to  the right, with the level of capital per 
worker increasing over time. This continues until investment per worker is just 
sufficient to maintain the existing level of capital per worker, that is until we return to 
the initial steady-state, E.  (See page 248.) So, the effect of immigration will only be 
temporary (because nothing happened to investment or required investment).

The figure on the left depicts the evolution 
of capital per worker over time.  Prior to 
time t, capital per worker is at the level k*. 
At time t, when there is an inflow of 
workers into Solowakia, capital per 
worker immediately drops to k’.  Then, 
over time, capital per worker increases 
back to the original steady-state level, k*.

5. 	 Suppose Solowakia (S) and Macronesia (M) have identical production functions and 
same δ , gN, and s. However, AS>AM.  Which country will have a higher steady-state 
capital per worker? Prove your answer mathematically and with a diagram.

Therefore, as A increases, k* increases. So, the country with a higher technological 
parameter, A, will have a higher steady-state level of capital per worker (which, in 
this case, is Solowakia). Intuitively, this follows from the fact that this technological 
change increases the marginal product of capital at every level of per worker capital 
stock.

6. 	 Assume that all countries are heading towards the same steady state (that is, in the 
long run, all countries have access to the same technology and have the same 
preferences as manifested in the same saving rate and population growth rate). Does 
the model predict growth for poorer countries should be faster, slower, or the same as 
richer countries?  Show mathematically.  (Hint: Define the growth rate of capital 
∆ k t
as g  = 
K 
k t 

.)

In this model, a poor country is poor because its capital per worker (k) is further 
below the steady-state value than is the capital per worker of a rich country (i.e. the 
marginal product of capital is greater in the poor country). This also means that its 
income per worker (y) is further below the steady-state income per worker. 

Countries that are approaching the steady state from below (which is true for poor 
countries) grow according to the excess of actual investment over investment that is 
required to maintain existing level of capital. The greater the difference, the faster is 
growth.  That is, countries that start out with lower k (“poor countries”) grow faster 
than countries with k closer to the steady state k (“ri cher countries”).

7. 	 Suppose that α =0.5 in the given production function.  Assume that the level of 
technology in the country depends on capital per worker, in particular A=kβ .  Discuss 
convergence and growth in an economy with β =0.5 and compare it to an economy 
with β <0.5.  Use diagrams and words. 

β + 0.5 
For this economy, yt= kt 
Convergence therefore will depend on the value of β . If the investment function, that 
β 
+ 0.5
is sk
, is concave in capital per worker, then there exists a steady state towards 
which economies with similar saving rates, technology growth rates, and 
depreciation rates will eventually converge. If it is convex, we will not converge to the 
steady state (the steady state will be unstable). 
For what values of β will the function be concave/convex? We can look at the second 
partial with respect to capital per worker, as we did on the problem set:

If the country starts out at the level of capital per worker such as k0, it will grow 
forever.  This is true for any starting level of capital per worker.  In this sense, the 
economy will never converge to a steady state.  The reason is that the production 
function is linear in capital, and therefore it does not exhibit diminishing returns to 
capital. 
What about growth in this economy?  We can use the same logic as in part 7 to 
answer this question.

This shows that k grows at a constant rate. So, this is a model of endogenous growth, 
because it generates steady growth even without technological progress. In contrast 
to the Solow model, growth depends, even in the long run, on the saving rate.

For β <0.5, there exists a steady state to which economies will eventually converge.

We have the standard diagram. (See solution to part 4.) 
In this model, just as in the standard Solow model, there is convergence to the steady-

The rest of the solution is just F.Y.I. 

What about when β >0.5? Then the diagram becomes:

k ’ 0
The steady state C is locally unstable. That is, if we start at any level of capital per 
worker below k**, the economy will shrink to nothing (illustrated by the move from k0 
to zero). So, this is like a poverty trap –  the country that starts out very poor not only 
stays poor, but grows poorer over time. Why? Because at k0, the amount of investment 
required to maintain that level of capital per worker exceeds actual investment. 
Therefore, k decreases, and the economy moves to the left, with the level of capital 
per worker decreasing over time.  
However, if the economy starts at a level of capital per worker above k**, then the 
economy will grow forever. This is because at k’ 0, actual investment exceeds the 
amount of investment required to maintain that level of capital per worker. Therefore, 
k increases, and the economy keeps moving to the right, with the level of capital per 
worker increasing over time.  
In this sense, there is no convergence for an economy with β≥  5.0
