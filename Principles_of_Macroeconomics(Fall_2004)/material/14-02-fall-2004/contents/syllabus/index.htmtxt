***** Overview *****
This course will provide an overview of macroeconomic issues: the determination
of output, employment, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation. Monetary
and fiscal policies are discussed, as are public debt and international
economic issues. It introduces basic models of macroeconomics and illustrates
principles with the experience of the United States and other economies.
***** Two Alternative Formats *****
The course has two alternative formats. Both formats will cover the same
topics, use the same textbook, and have the same required assignments,
including quizzes and problem sets. As we receive more information on class
enrollment, there may be changes in the number of sections and recitations.
   1. Lecture-Recitation: You attend one-hour lectures on Mondays and
      Wednesdays, given by Professor Caballero. You also attend a one-hour
      recitation on Fridays, run by the head TA. During Friday recitations -
      - which are not optional -- instructors will go over weekly problem sets,
      review materials from the lectures. If you elect the Lecture-Recitation
      option, you may choose one of theÂ one-hour Friday recitations.
   2. All-Section: You attend one-hour sections on Mondays, Wednesdays, and
      Fridays, run by a TA.
As we receive more information on class enrollment, we may need to make changes
in recitations or sections. (If any one section is too large, we may ask
students to move to different times.)
***** Readings *****
The text for the course is the third edition ofÂ Macroeconomics, by Olivier
Blanchard. Please get the last edition.Â In addition, it is also suggested that
students get into the habit of browsing the daily newspaperÂ The_Wall_Street
JournalÂ orÂ The_Financial_Times, or the weekly magazineÂ The_EconomistÂ at
least a couple of times a month; all offer good (and well-written) coverage of
economic events, and will provide some context for the course.
[Buy_at_Amazon] Blanchard, Olivier. Macroeconomics. 3rd ed. Upper Saddle River,
N.J.: Prentice Hall, 2003. ISBN: 0130671002.
***** Assignments, Exams, and Grades *****
The course grades will be based on three quizzes and 6 weekly problem sets. The
grade will be primarily determined by the average of the three quiz scores. You
will hand in the problem sets to your TA in class or to the head TA if you
choose to take Professor Caballeroâs lecture.Â  The problem sets can count in
the final grade for border line cases.Â  A necessary condition for the problem
sets to help you in these border line cases is that all 6 problem sets have
been handed in.Â  For students who are on the border between two grades,
performance on the problem sets can result in the higher grade, while failing
to hand in problem sets can result in the lower grade.Â Problem sets are due on
the due date. We will not accept late problem sets.
