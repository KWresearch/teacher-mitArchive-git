Introduction

Congratulations! You are now a member of an exper t design team. Your col­
lective task will be to design a new residence suitable for inhabitants of the imagi­
nary Deltoid plane. These written materials, provided to help you prepare for this 
task, are organized in four sections. 

The next section provides an overview of life on the Deltoid plane, DeltaP as it is known to the 
natives.  The  following  section  describes  your  team,  and  the  ﬁnal,  your  design  task.  A  second 
handout,  different  for  each  team member,  provides  the  speciﬁc 
information  you  will  need  to  per­
form  the  role you have been assigned within your  team. Each  team member will contribute differ­
ent  exper tise  to  the  project,  and  each  has  different  design  responsibilities  to  fulﬁll.  All must work 
together for your team to create a  ﬁrst-r ate design. 

1.2  Life on DeltaP 

Life  on DeltaP,  residential  and  otherwise,  is  quite  different  from what  you  have  grown  accus­
tomed to here on Ear th. First off, DeltaP is a plane, not a planet, so your team will be designing in 
two-dimensional  rather  than  three-dimensional  space.  If  your  design  “meets  spec”  and  is  consid­
ered attractive and functional by your Deltan clients, one view on a single sheet of paper will con­
vey to those responsible for constructing it all the information they need to do so.

Life on DeltaP 

The view on this single sheet may not be quite what you expect, however, because in addition 
to lacking a z axis, Deltoid space has unfamiliar relations between the x and y axes as well. What 
we  think  of  as  “per pendicular”  is  hopelessly  skewed  to  a  Deltan,  and  vice-versa.  In  our  units,  a 
right angle on DeltaP measures 60o or  π
/3  radians. Thus all  sides of an equilateral  triangle  form 
lines  considered  perpendicular  to  all  others.  If  there were  such  a  thing  as  a  “circle ”  on DeltaP,  it 
would be composed of only 4π
/3 radians. 

But there is no such thing as a “circle”  on DeltaP, nor even the concept of continuity embodied 
therein. In this  ﬂat  though angular world, residents construct their ar tifacts strictly with discrete tri­
angular forms. Of these, the equilateral triangle -- with its three perpendicular sides (!)-- is consid­
ered  the  most  pleasing.  Accordingly,  your  team  will  design  the  residence  by  assembling  into  a

cluster the most prized building materials on DeltaP, equilateral triangular components called “del­
tas.”  Deltas come in red and blue versions and always measure 2 lyns per side. Four “quar ter-del­
tas”,  QDs, triangular units of area measure with sides of 1 lyn,  ﬁt within a delta. 

Lyns?  QDs?  Not  surprisingly,  Deltan  systems  of  measurement  are  as  unfamiliar  as  that  for 
spatial coordinates. Table 1 summarizes the measurement schemes on DeltaP that you will need 
to know to carry out your design task. 

All of DeltaP’ s units of measure share the divisibility and extensibility conventions of the metric

system; in the measure of time, for example, there are both microwex (µ wx) and megawex (Mwx). 
In relation to the attention-and life-spans of Deltans, these units are roughly equivalent to seconds 
and years, respectively, here on Ear th. 

As  building  components,  deltas  have  functional  and  aesthetic  characteristics  that  are  more 
complex than their simple form and even dimensions would suggest. Especially when assembled 
into  a  cluster,  as  you will  be  doing,  they  behave  in  interesting ways. Deltas  conduct  heat  among 
themselves,  radiate heat  to outer space, melt  if  too hot, and grow  if  too cool. Red deltas produce 
heat.  All  deltas  are  subject  to  DeltaP’ s  two-dimensional  gravity  (which  is  itself  subject  to  axial 
shifts during DeltaP’ s not-infrequent gravity waves). Three different kinds of cement are needed to 
join them together, and joint alignment with respect to gravity affects ease of production as well as

structural  integrity.  Different  colors  and  different  quantities  of  deltas  cost  different  amounts  of 
money per delta, and can be assembled in clusters that are either exceedingly ugly or very attrac­
tive to the Deltans. Your task will be to create a design that meets prescribed goals for all of these 
characteristics. 

1.3  Design Team Roles & Responsibilities 

Your  design  team  is  organized  such  that  each  of  you  will  be  responsible  for  a  subset  of  the 
design goals. One of you will be PROJECT MANAGER. Your main concerns will be with cost and 
schedule, the interpretation and reconciliation of performance speciﬁcations , and negotiations with 
the  contractor  and  client.  You  want  to  keep  costs  and  time-to-build  at  a  minimum,  but  not  at  the 
expense of quality. When your  team submits  its  ﬁnal  design,  the project manager must  repor t  the 
estimated cost (in zwigs) and the time (in wex) that it will take to build. 

Another  of  you will  be  the STRUCTURAL ENGINEER. Your main  concern will  be  to  see  that 
the design  “holds  together ”  as a physical structure under prescribed  loading conditions. You must 
see to it that the two points at which your structure is tied to ground are appropriately chosen and 
that  continuity  of  the  structure  is maintained. When  your  team  submits  its  ﬁnal  design,  the  struc­
tural engineer must attest  to  its  integrity by  identifying  the  strongest and weakest  joints, and esti­
mating the average load on all joints expressed as a percentage of the failure load. 

Another  of  you  will  be  the  THERMAL  ENGINEER.  You  will  want  to  insure  that  the  design 
meets  the  “comf or t-zone”  conditions speciﬁed  in  terms of an average  temperature. You must also 
ensure  that  the  temperature  of  all  individual  deltas  stays within  cer tain  bounds. When  your  team 
submits  its  ﬁnal  design,  the  thermal engineer must estimate  internal  temperature and  identify  the 
hottest and coldest deltas. 

Finally, one of you will be the ARCHITECT. Your concern is with both the form of the design in 
and  of  itself  and  how  it  stands  in  its  setting.  You  must  see  to  it  that  the  interior  of  the  residence 
takes  an  appropriate  form  and  that  egress  is  convenient.  You  should  also  develop  a  design  with 
character. When your  team submits  its  ﬁnal  design,  the architect should be prepared  to present a 
sketch and discuss generally how and why  the Deltans will  ﬁnd  the residence attractive and  func­
tional. The architect will also be asked  to estimate a  few more quantitative measures of architec­
tural performance. 

The  following section describes  the speciﬁcations  that your design must meet  to be accepted 
by your clients on DeltaP. Familiarize yourself with these speciﬁcations . Then, for schooling in your 
specialty, turn to the separate primer you have received that discusses the science and technology 
of  your  domain.  The  primer  contains  the  knowledge  and  heuristics  you  will  need  to  estimate  the 
design parameters for which you are responsible. If you have questions that it does not answer, do 
not hesitate to ask. You should be exper t in your role before your team begins the design phase. 

1.4  The Design Task 

Your Deltan clients have cleared the space shown on the site map and come to your team with 
their  need  for  the  design  of  a  new  residential  cluster.  The  cluster  itself  must  meet  the  following 
speciﬁcations . 

The client wants the cluster to provide a minimum interior area of 100 QDs (Each diamond on 
your girded site map deﬁnes  an area of  two QDs). The shape of  this space, which can of course 
exceed  the  minimum,  is  a  matter  of  design.  The  client  has  expressed  enthusiasm  for  the  newer 

DELTA DESIGN

The Design Task 

mode of segmenting interior space, a mode that breaks with the two-equal-zone tradition and val­
ues the suggested privacy of nooks and crannies. Still the space must be connected,  i.e. no  inte­
rior  walls  can  cut  the  space  into  completely  separate  spaces.  There  must  be  one  and  only  one 
entrance/exit. 

The client is known to be color sensitive blue; too much blue brings on the blues, so to speak. 
No more  than  60%  blue  ought  to  be  allowed;  cer tainly  blue  deltas  are  not  to  exceed  70%  of  the 
cluster. 

The residence, as all clusters, must be anchored at two points and two points only. There is a 
limit to the amount of force each anchor can suppor t, as well as to the amount of internal moment 
each  joint  can  withstand.  Exceeding  either  limit  would  cause  catastrophic  failure  and  send  the 
unwary  residents  tumbling  into  the  void. The  cluster  should be designed  for a  life of  thir ty mega­
wex. Gravity waves, rare but always possible, should be considered. 

The  average  interior  temperature  must  be  kept  within  the  Deltan  comfor t  zone,  which  lies 
between  55  and  65  oNin.  The  temperature  of  the  elements  themselves  must  be  kept  above  the 
growth  point  of  20  oNn  and  below  the melt-down  point  of  85  oNn. Delta  temperatures  outside  of 
this range will result in catastrophic structural failure with little more warning than excessive load. 

All  of  this  -- design,  fabrication  and  construction  -- must  be  done  under  a  ﬁ xed  budget  and 
within  a  given  time  period.  At  your  team  meeting  you  are  to  develop  a  conceptual  design  that 
meets or exceeds all design goals. When each team submits their design, individual members will 
be asked to repor t design performance on parameters for which they are responsible.

1.1 

Introduction 

As thermal engineer, you are responsible for the comfor t and thermal stability 
of your team’ s design. This primer will review some basics of heat transfer on 
DeltaP, then cover methods you may use to estimate the average temperature and 
extreme values for individual deltas. It assumes you have read the introduction to 
the exercise. 

To insure the comfor t of prospective residents, you want the average temperature of all deltas 
in the cluster, a good proxy for interior temperature, to fall between 55 and 65 degrees Nn. For sta­
bility, you want the temperature of each delta to stay above 20 oNn and below 85 oNn , as they melt 
at 85 oNn and begin to grow at 20 oNn . Either event would have catastrophic consequences, with 
your clients tumbling down the plane amidst the wreckage of their dwelling. When your team sub­
mits  its  ﬁnal  design, therefore, you will be asked to estimate  internal temperature and the  location 
and temperature of the hottest and coldest deltas. 

1.2  Deltan Basics of Heat Transfer 

Deltas, the building elements your team will use to design the residence, come  in two  ﬂ avors: 
red  and  blue. Red  deltas  are  heat  sources, while  blue  deltas  are  passive,  neither  a  source  nor  a 
sink. 

The  red sources produce heat continually over  time, at a  rate, q0  measure  in Deltan Thermal 
Units  per  microwex  (dtu/ µ wx).  While  q0  varies  from  supplier  to  supplier  and  even  from  batch  to 
batch  due  to  manufacturing  irregularities,  your  project  manager  has  found  a  supplier  willing  to 
guarantee minimal variance around the value: 
q0 = units of heat produced by each red delta per unit time = 160 dtu/µ wx 

All  deltas,  red  and  blue,  conduct  heat  to  and  from  adjacent  elements  in  the  cluster.  The 
amount of heat conducted per unit time is determined by three things: 

• the temperature difference between the adjacent deltas; 

• the length of the joint between the adjacent elements;

• a coefﬁcient of conductivity , kc 

The coefﬁcient  kc also varies by supplier, though because of differences in the cement used to 
join  the  deltas  rather  than  in  the  deltas  themselves. Your  supplier  has  agreed  to  provide  cement 
with conductivity that varies minimally around the value: 

kc =heat conducted per unit length, per unit time, per unit temperature difference 
= 2 dtu/lyn/ µ wx/oNn 

Deltas  of  either  color  also  radiate  heat  into  the Deltoid  outer  plane,  but  only when  they  have 
outward-pointing, free nodes on the exterior wall, as indicated in the  ﬁgure belo w.

Like the rate of conductivity, the rate of heat transfer by radiation is propor tional to: 

• the temperature difference between the radiating element and the outer 
plane;  since  the  plane’ s  temperature  is  0  degrees  Nn,  this  term  simply 
becomes the element’ s temperature 

• the  length  of  exposed  edges  on  both  sides  of  the  free  node,  known  as 
radiant length; 

• a coefﬁcient of r adiative transfer, kR 

The coef ﬁcient  kR is ﬁx ed. Deltas with free nodes will radiate heat at the rate: 

kR = heat radiated per unit radiant length per unit time per unit temperature difference 
kR = 1 dtu/lyn/µ wx/oNn 

The ﬁgure  shows a simple cluster to illustrate. Deltas #1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10,12 and 13 are red: each 
produces 160 dtu/ µ wx, together adding 1280 dtu/ µ wx to the structure. This heat will be conducted 
through  the cluster at  rates dependent upon  the  length of  the  joints, which, star ting with  the  joint

between #1 and #2 and working up,  look  to be about 1, 1, 1/2, 1 1/2,....  lyn respectively. Remem­
ber that the side of the delta is 2 lyns long. 

Regardless of conduction  ﬂo ws,  looking at all of  the deltas  together as a single ensemble, all 
of the heat generated by the 8 red deltas must be radiated away at the same rate at which it is pro­
duced  through  the 9  free nodes  indicated  in  the  ﬁgure . Deltas #1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, and 14 have 
free,  outward  pointing  nodes,  and  thus  will  radiate  heat  into  the  plane  at  rates  dependent  upon 
their  radiant  lengths.  (Note  that  #12  has  two  free,  outward  pointing  nodes).The  radiant  length  for 
#1 looks to be about 3 lyns, allowing for the addition of an adjacent delta with fur ther construction; 
#3 shows a radiant  length of again 3  lyns; #4, a  full 4  lyns; #6, 2.5  lyns and so on. (We anticipate 
that  with  fur ther  construction,  #15  will  be  left  with  no  free  node  and  show  no  radiating  length). 
Along with  the  basics  just  discussed,  this  is  all  the  information we will  need  to  estimate  the  clus­
ter’ s thermal proper ties. 

1.3  Estimating Average Temperature 

To  determine  whether  your  team ’ s  design  will  provide  the  Deltans  with  a  comfor table  living 
space, you should estimate the average temperature of all deltas in the cluster as a best guess of 
interior temperature. The easiest way to calculate this average is to ﬁrst  estimate the average tem­
perature of the subset of radiating deltas from a steady-state heat balance. The following equation 
describes  this  equilibrium,  where  the  heat  generated  by  the  red  deltas  is  balanced  by  the  heat 
radiated by all deltas with free nodes: 

NR • qo = T* • N* • L* • kR 

where: 

NR is the number of red deltas


 N* is the number of radiating deltas;


 L* is the average radiant length of deltas with free nodes;


T* is the estimate of average temperature of the radiating deltas. 

Solving for T* gives us: 

T* = (NR • qo) / (N* • L* • kR) 

and plugging in the values from the sample cluster on the previous page gives us: 

T* =(8•160) / (8• 3.5• 1) = 45.7 oNn 

In this I have taken the average radiating length as 3.5 lyns. 

One  could at  this point  take T*,  the average  temperature of  the  subset of  radiating deltas, as 
the estimate of the average temperature of the entire cluster. That would be an adequate estimate 
as  long as  the deltas  that are not  in  the subset of  radiating deltas,  — 
i.e., #2, #5, #9, #11, #13  — 
are blue, not red. We see this is not the case; #5 and #13 are red, heat generating elements.

Estimating Maximum Temperature 

In  this  case we  proceed  to  estimate  the  temperature  of,  let  us  call  them  the  interior  reds, as  
follows: 

• Set up the heat balance for the interior red with its adjacent deltas. (We use #5 as an 
example). The heat in must balance the heat out. 

Heat in through generation 

qo = (T5-T4)•l5,4•kc + (T5-T6)•l5,6•kc

Heat Conducted from #5 out to #6 
Heat Conducted from #5 out to #4 

• Assume the temperatures of the adjacent, radiating deltas are all equal to the aver­
age temperature of the subset, T*, i.e., 45.7 oNn. 

• Estimate the overlap lengths i.e., l5,4 ~1.5 lyns; l5,6 ~ 1 lyn. 

• Given qo = 160 dtu/mwx and kc = 2 dtu/mwx/lyn, solve for the temperature of the 
interior red, i.e., 

160 = (T5 - 45.7)•1.5•2 + (T5 - 45.7)•1•2 

giving: 

T5 = 77.7 oNn. 

In  a  similar way,  the  temperature  of  the  other,  interior  red  delta  is  estimated  to  be  the  same, 
T13 = 77.7 oNn. 

The other,  interior but blue deltas are all  taken as T*,  the average of  the radiating deltas. Our 
estimate of  the average  temperature of  the entire cluster of 15 deltas, with 2  interior  reds at 77.7 
and the remaining 13 at T* = 45.7 is just 

T ~ [2• 77.7 + 13• 45.7]/(15) = 50 oNn. 

This  estimate  is  within  5%  of  the  value  (52.36  oNn)  predicted  by  a  sophisticated  computer 
model of the cluster, and is cer tainly good enough for our purposes. We see that interior tempera­
ture is below the comfor t zone, and hence that the design needs either another red or less radiant 
length. 

Keep your calculations as simple as possible. Work only  in  integers and don’t  be  reluctant  to 
“e yeball”  your  estimates  of  average  radiant  length.  It  may  be  easier  just  to  add  up  total  radiant 
length, rather than ﬁgur ing N* • L*. 

1.4  Estimating Maximum Temperature 

The most  likely  “hot  spot”  occurs  where  there  is  an  interior  red,  or  where  three  or more  red 
deltas  are  placed  in  sequence,  as with  elements  #5-7  in  the  ﬁgure .  As  a  general  rule  to  prevent 
catastrophic overheating, you should avoid joining more than two red deltas in an unbroken string 

8

   DELTA DESIGN 

Estimating Maximum Temperature 

and  be  very  careful with  interior  reds.  For  example,  if  an  interior  red were  added  to  the  structure 
adjacent to #9, 

7 

8 

10 

16

too high a  temperature  is  liable  to result. An estimate of  the  temperature of  the additional,  interior 
red is again obtained from a heat balance, namely 

qo ~ (T16 - T 9)• l16,9• kc 

with kc = 2, estimating l16,9 ~ 1.5 and taking T9 = 45.7 = T* we obtain: 

T16 = 99 oNn 

which  is above  the  limit  —  meltdown  is  inevitable. Alocal  ﬁx  would  require ensuring a broad  con­
ductive path (good overlap) through #9 and #8 out to the radiating deltas. If the latter were blue as 
well as radiating, it is possible to keep the temperature of an interior red with spec 

In  a  like  manner,  If  your  team ’ s  design  does  call  for  three  reds  in  sequence,  then  you  again 
must be careful: you ought  to  insist  that at  least  two have  free, outward pointing, nodes, as do #6 
and  #7.  Even  so  you  are walking  on  thin  ice. Recall  our  estimate  of  T5  was  but  3  oNn  below  the 
meltdown limit. 

We might wonder about  the  temperature of #6.  It no doubt  is greater  than T*,  the average of 
the  subset  of  radiating  blue  as  well  as  red  deltas.  An  estimate  of  its  temperature  follows  from 
assuming that all heat generated by this middle element is radiated away and none is conducted to 
(or ﬂo ws in from) adjacent deltas. Thus we obtain: 

T6 = qo /(L*•kR) 

where L- is  the radiant  length of  the delta  in question. Plugging  in  the radiant  length shown  in 
the example gives us: 

T6 ~ 160/(2.5•1) = 64 oNn 

which is high, but tolerable. 

The  computer  model,  however,  gives  the  temperature  of  #6  as  greater  than  85  degrees,  no 
doubt because #5 can’t  radiate and hence adds heat to #6. All of this merely reinforces the general 
rule: don’t  place more than 2 red deltas in sequence if you can help it, and arrange for ample radi­
ant heat loss if you can’t a void doing so.

Estimating Minimum Temperature 

1.5  Estimating Minimum Temperature 

A  long  string  of  radiating  blue  elements  can  result  in  very  low  temperatures.  Consider,  for 
example,  the  case where  #5  and  #6  of  our  original work  in  progress  are  blue  instead  of  red. We 
can estimate the temperature of such a string, shown in the  ﬁgure belo w, as follows: 

4 lyns 

4 

2.5 lyns 

3 lyns 

3 

6 

7

5 

3.5 lyns

The temperature of the blue string will stabilize when the amount of heat radiated by the string 
balances the amount of heat conducted into it. The red elements that bound the string will conduct 
this heat into the string at some rate ql + qr where ql and qr are the rates of heat conducted into the 
string by the left and right red deltas respectively. This heat will radiate out of the string at the rate 
T4• 4 lyns • kr + T6 • 2.5 lyns • kr. 

If we take the sum ql + qr  to be on the order of qo, that is, half of the heat generated by each of 
the  two bounding  reds  is available  to heat  this  sequence of  three blues and  if we  fur ther  take T4 
equal  to T6, we obtain 24.6 oNn as an estimate  for  the  temperature of #4 and #6. This  is border­
line.  In  fact,  the  computer  program  gives  the  temperature  of  all  three  blues  to  be  just  below  20 
oNn: Note that once below 20 degrees Nn, the string would star t to grow, the dwelling would dete­
riorate  rapidly,  and  the  clients  and  the  insurance  company  would  not  be  happy.  You ’ d  probably 
hear from their lawyer. 

This  completes  the  thermal  engineering  primer.  These  rules  are  not  hard  and  fast,  nor  are 
they complete. But they should be sufﬁcient  to guide you in your task of assuring the comfor t and 
thermal stability of your team’ s design.
