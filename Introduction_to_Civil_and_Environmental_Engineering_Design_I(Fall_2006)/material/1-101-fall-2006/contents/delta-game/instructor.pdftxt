Introduction 

Delta Design is a team exercise created for undergraduate education in engi­
neering. It requires approximately 3-4 hours —  all in one sitting or spread out over 
several session. The major goal of the exercise is to have students learn  — b y 
doing  — that design in volves, not just technical exper tise, but extensive negotia­
tion among specialists working to reconcile divergent views and conﬂicting agen­
das. 

Par ticipants learn that design in teams -- the kind of design they will do most often in the work­
place  -- is a social process as well as a  technical process, and  that excellence  in design  requires 
simultaneous attention to both. Along the way, the exercise impar ts or reinforces basic knowledge 
about the modeling of physical systems, the application of heuristic reasoning, the costing of differ­
ent options and the like. It has the additional beneﬁt of being fun. 

The exercise replicates in microcosm the sometimes uncomfor table reality that no matter how 
hard designers on a team try to work independently, to decompose a task into separate phases, or 
to deﬁne  clean interfaces, they still ﬁnd  it impossible to avoid the intersection of interests, the fram­
ing  of  tradeoffs,  and  the  compromising  of  requirements,  speciﬁcations ,  and  goals.  Delta  Design 
brings these characteristics of process front and center with deliberate collisions between domains 
and a  task so  tightly coupled  that design changes  in any dimension affect all others.  It does so  to 
help students understand the true nature of engineering design, to give them a feel for what engi­
neers really do1. 

Students  assume and  learn  one  of  four exper t  roles,  join  a  team  in which  all  roles  are  repre­
sented,  and  design  together  a  residence  for  the  inhabitants  of  an  imaginary world. The  roles  are 
architect, project manager, structural engineer, and thermal engineer. Their domains are not as simple 
as might be inferred from an exercise engaged with ordinary equilateral triangles. Nor are the ten­
sions  and  tradeoffs  between  them  straight  forward;  the  ar tiﬁcial  design  space  has  been  con­
structed  to  capture,  yet  clarify,  the  kinds  of  tradeoffs  that  exist  in  the  real  world  of  engineering 
design.

Introduction 

The  design  itself,  an  assemblage  of  elemental  components  called  deltas  that  acquire  varied 
aesthetic, ﬁscal,  structural and thermal characteristics when assembled, must satisfy performance 
criteria in each dimension, for each role. Teams whose members get beyond mastery of individual 
domains  and  develop  effective  strategies  for working  together  can  produce  designs  that meet  or 
exceed spec. Dysfunctional groups have more dif ﬁculty , even if individual members are exception­
ally  gifted  in  their  specialties.  Par ticipants  are  keenly  aware  of  this  by  the  end  of  the  exercise, 
when they present their work to the class. 

While  the  central  lessons  of  Delta  Design  are  unchangeable,  the  instructor  never theless 
retains considerable  leeway  to  tailor  the exercise as he or she sees  ﬁt,  to  teach different  lessons 
about  design.  This  tailoring  can  be  done  by  tinkering  with  the  “science ”  of  the  design  space,  or 
simply  by  establishing  context with  introductory  remarks,  post-exercise  discussion,  and  the  point 
where the exercise is embedded in the syllabus. Possible variations include: 

• Design  constraints  and  performance  speciﬁcations  can  be  adjusted  to 
make  tradeoffs  tight  and  complex  or  they  can  be  relaxed  to  avoid  them. 
Multiple  plays  of  the  exercise  under  these  different  conditions,  either  in 
time by  the same group or simultaneously by more  than one group, pro­
vides substance for comparison, discussion and learning. 

• The exercise can stress the need to think broadly about design, to real­
ize  that  fulﬁlling  one’ s  own  obligations  on  a  project  is  not  suf ﬁcient 
to 
ensure a good outcome. One must work with, and trust in, others. 

• It can serve as a basis for a discussion of the problem of evaluating dif­
ferent  design  outcomes: What  is  a  “good”  design?  Is  quality  a matter  of 
meeting specs at minimum cost? What  is a  “rob ust”  design? What  if  two 
out  of  four  par ticipants  are  satisﬁed  but  the  others  uncomfor table  with 
their  contribution?  Does  the  integrity,  enthusiasm  and  vitality  of  the 
design process tell us anything about the quality of a design product? 

• Delta Design can be used to emphasize communication skills, both dur­
ing  interactive  play  and  in  post-play  presentation  of  group  results.  In  the 
process of designing, par ticipants realize the need to provide reasons for 
their recommended design moves clearly and succinctly and in terms the 
others, not schooled in their specialty, can understand. 

• Ideally,  multiple  teams  play  the  game  simultaneously  and  when  done, 
present their design to the others. The instructor can use the occasion to 
critique communication skills.1 

This is a list of some of the educational goals that can be addressed with the Delta Design. It 
is by no means an exhaustive one, as  in  the authors’  experience, play corresponds so closely  to 
design in the “real  world”  that par ticipants and observers alike add new suggestions and observa­
tions after each round. At the same time, it is game-like in many respects — 
in asking par ticipants 
to play a role, in the intensity with which they do so, in the competitive quality of their interactions, 
and in competition between teams. 

1.  The exercise works best if there is more than one team engaged in the play. Five to ten teams 
going at it in the same room engenders a lively session.

The Design Task 

2.  The Design Task 

The task assigned in Delta Design is described as the design of a residence 
for the inhabitants of an imaginary world, but more precisely, it is to assemble red 
and blue triangles into an envelope anchored in two-dimensional space. 

The triangles, called  “deltas”,  generate and/or conduct and/or radiate heat, are acted upon by 
gravity,  and  cost  money,  as  does  the  glue  that  holds  them  together.  The  envelope  must  be  spa­
cious,  structurally  sound,  thermally  balanced,  aesthetically  pleasing,  and  able  to  be  constructed 
within budget and schedule. The task is a challenge as well as abstract. 

It was made abstract for several reasons, the most general being to moot the previous experi­
ence of par ticipants and generate a  “pure”  design process untainted by prior knowledge, a design 
process  in which  the design product  is equally unfamiliar  to all. The abstraction  controls  the  con­
text  in which  par ticipants work  and  emphasizes  the  point  that while  there  is  one  design,  different 
par ticipants have very different visions of what it is and what it means. 

Abstractness  also  allows  par ticipants  with  differing  backgrounds  and  levels  of  experience  to 
interpret and read into the exercise different things. The exercise has been engaged by undergrad­
uates,  (freshmen  to  seniors),  graduate  students,  and  practicing  engineers  alike,  with  different 
dynamics  but  equal  satisfaction.  While  the  abstractness  of  the  task  disconnects  it  from  the  real 
world,  the  open  form  of  the  design  problem  is  all  too  familiar  to  practicing  designers. There  is  no 
single  “r ight  answer,”  nor  even  a  ﬁnite  set  of  solutions.  There  are  speciﬁcations 
to  meet,  and 
assor ted ways to assess performance, but the authors themselves have little idea just how good a 
design a team can create. 

The  design  task  is  also  malleable,  in  the  sense  that,  as  previously  discussed,  the  instructor 
can  modify  it  by  changing  either  the  context  or  the  speciﬁcations .  We  caution  that  changing  the 
specs should not be done lightly, lest the task become too easy or too dif ﬁcult,  and that instructors 
should observe a  few  rounds before doing so. On  the other hand, we have  left a powerful  “le ver”, 
the  overhead multiplication  factor,  completely  at  the  instructor ’ s  discretion.  This  factor,  which  the 
project  manager  needs  to  know  at  the  outset,  should  be  speciﬁed  somewhere  between  1.0  and 
2.0. At the lower bound, coming in under budget is trivial, while at the upper bound cost becomes 
a heavy constraint. We have occasionally relaxed or tightened this factor midway through the exer­
cise when teams appear to be paying too much or too little attention to cost. 

For more  information  on  the  design  task,  refer  to  the  introductory  handout  for  all  par ticipants 
and the primers for each role. 

3.  The Exercise 

Delta Design has four phases requiring a total time commitment of three to 
four hours. In the  ﬁrst phase , par ticipants are given an overview of the exercise 
and an introductory handout to read, then assigned and taught their roles. In the 
second phase, teams design. In the third, they present and defend their work,. 
The four th and ﬁnal phase is f or review and discussion. 

The instructor should allow an hour for the ﬁrst  stage, or alternately, assign roles and distribute 
materials  beforehand;  instructors  taking  this  approach  should  request  that  students  not  discuss 
their roles before the actual act of designing begins. 

One hour should be  reserved  for design, with a  ten minute warning given near  the end of  the 
hour so  that  teams can  ﬁnaliz e  their designs and prepare  for presentation. Five minutes per  team 
is sufﬁcient  for presentation. A matrix summary of each team ’ s performance measures is useful for

comparison purposes —  but make sure the architectural qualities of the design are included in this 
comparison. 

Closing discussion can  last  from 10  to 30 minutes. These are  recommended minimums; any 
or all can be lengthened at the instructor ’ s discretion. 

3.1 

Instruction 

Par ticipants need to learn their roles. Training is done best by having four tutors, one for each 
role, take the students aside after they have familiarized themselves with their primers, to indoctri­
nate them in the lore of their trade. The tutors should lead discussion, answer questions, and basi­
cally conduct a shor t course in project management, structural mechanics, or the like. The  ﬁdelity 
of the design phase is deeply affected by the depth of knowledge and strength of role identiﬁcation 
impar ted during training, so don’t skimp; as in lif e, the more training the better. 

Thermal engineers must  learn  to estimate average  temperature. The method described  in  the 
primer works quite well and is relatively straightforward once the notions of free, outward-pointing, 
node  and  radiating  length  are  grasped.  Estimating  the  temperature  of  individual  deltas,  on  the 
other  hand  —  whether  too  hot  or  too  cold  — 
is  a  cruder,  less  sure  affair.  The  primer  describes 
some  situations  to  avoid  but  these  are  not  absolute  nor  do  they  represent  all  cases  where  one 
could get  into  trouble. The player must develop and appropriate  the  information provided  for  their 
own use. 

Structural  engineers  need  to  know  the  impor tance  of  symmetry  in  distributing  gravitational 
loads.  They  should  see  that  the  best  situation  is when  both  suppor t  points  carry  the  same  load. 
This will  be  the  case  if  the  two are equidistant  (remember  the  skewed measure)  from a  line  run­
ning in the direction of the inplane gravitational force passing through the cluster’ s center of grav­
ity.  Estimating  internal moments  is more  dif ﬁcult  but  the  primer  provides  the means  to  carry  this 
out. Having  the student experiment with a conﬁgur ation of deltas  layed out on  the grid, exploring 
with  the role  instructor,  the magnitude of  the  internal moment as one moves around  the structure 
is a very useful, warm-up exercise. 

Project  managers  have  to  ﬁgure  out  which  cost  components  are  critical,  what  will  make  or 
break  the schedule. The  instructions,  tables and graphs  in  the primer provide  the basis  for  these 
calculations. Note that though the project manager has responsibility for cost and schedule but  is 
not “in  charge”  of the team. During training, make sure that they understand this point so that team 
leadership style and authority relationships can develop naturally during the exercise. 

Architects  need  to  develop  conﬁdence 
in  their  knowledge  that  they  know  what  constitutes  a 
good design. The  individual playing  this  role,  the  “softest” 
in an otherwise  “hard”  exercise, needs 
to develop an aesthetic for the imaginary world. The primer provides a star t, but more elaboration 
of what the clients value or disdain should be encouraged. This can be spontaneously constructed 
by the player, or representative “good”  and “bad”  designs might be provided. It is essential that the 
architect speak conﬁdently  when confronted with the more  instrumental mindsets of other par tici­
pants. During the design stage, architects that rely more on “hard”  measures from the primer than 
on their innate sense of what the design  “should look lik e” are not doing the job as the y should. 

It  is  desirable  that  students  be  exper t  in  their  roles  before  design  begins,  which  in  practice 
means  that  the  engineers  need more  time  to  prepare  than  the  architect  or  project manager. We 
have observed, however, that even if a par ticipant does not fully understand all of the intricacies of 
their role, once play begins they are the exper t.

The Exercise 

3.2  Designing 

We  have  traditionally  star ted  the  exercise  by  having  the  architect  layout  a  preliminary  design 
for their team. This serves several purposes. First, it helps architects develop their aesthetic sense 
in  a  way  that  training  cannot; more  than  the  other  roles,  they  need  to  learn  by  doing.  Second,  it 
gives  the  architects  something  to  do  while  the  engineers  complete  their  more  lengthy  training. 
Finally,  it  is  impor tant  to  get  something  out  quickly  for  the  teams  to  work  with,  and  experience 
shows  that  when  all  par ticipate,  initial  designs  are  slow  to  materialize.  Once  they  have  an  initial 
conﬁgur ation in front of them, all can take par t in designing, critiquing, recommend adjustments or 
even “let’ s star t all over again.” 

Alternatively, designing could begin by presenting the team with an existing design, say of last 
year’ s model,  or  of  a  block  house  style  which  clearly  won’t  meet  the  performance  speciﬁcations . 
The most impor tant point is to get the team going with a concept on the board, whatever its origins. 

Once  design  is  underway,  the  one  rule  for  instructors  is  to  not  intervene  or  interfere.  At  their 
discretion,  the  instructor can answer questions,  —  a  team might be charged a  few zwigs or so  for 
an outside consultant’ s  input  —  but by and  large,  the  teams should be  left  to  fend  for  themselves. 
Take note of questions asked and cover them during training in the next round of the exercise. Our 
one exception to this rule has been to change the overhead factor if attention to cost seems inap­
propriately high or low. 

Finally,  the  instructor should give a 10 minute warning  to  let  teams know  they need  to  ﬁnaliz e 
their design and calculate the performance measures requested in their handouts. 

3.3  Presentation & Evaluation 

At  ﬁrst  glance,  the  teams’  ﬁnal  designs  are  easy  to  evaluate  and  compare;  each  par ticipant 
has  the  tools  to  analyze  the  design  along  their  dimensions  of  responsibility,  and  the  primers  tell 
them that they will be asked to repor t hard performance measures at the end of the exercise. Even 
the architect can marshal numbers  to discuss  the mix and dispersion of colors,  internal area, etc. 
Sometimes  it  works  best  to  have  a  panel  (perhaps  made  up  of  the  tutors  as  judges)  review  the 
designs of different teams. But the repor ting and comparison of specs should be regarded as only 
the ﬁrst step in e valuation. 

The ﬁrst  point to be raised at this juncture is that the evaluation of design is not a simple matter 
than can be  reduced  to numerical cer tainty.  If a design  is engineered  to perfection but  falls  ﬂat  in 
the market place, is it a “good”  design? What if it sells like hotcakes but is shoddily constructed? In 
the immediate context of the exercise, what if the clients really would have been happier with a big­
ger  home  and  a  cost  overrun?  Would  they  have  willingly  traded  off  slight  thermal  discomfor t  for 
aesthetic  delight,  or  vice  versa?  What  about  the  innate  sense  par ticipants  may  have  of  which 
design simply looks better? There are many aspects of design quality that defy measurement. 

The  second  point  to  be  made  is  that,  in  this  exercise  anyway,  the  process  of  design  is  as 
impor tant as the product, and that the two are closely linked. The purpose of Delta Design is not to 
learn how to best assemble triangles -- a skill in limited demand -- but to learn what transpires, and 
how  to manage what  transpires, when exper ts view a common goal  through different  lenses, and 
try  to move  towards  it  from different star ting points. A key strength of  the exercise  is  that  the rela­
tionship between the quality of this process and the quality of the product  is almost always strong 
and  transparent.  Teams  that  do  the  best  job  of  mitigating  conﬂicts  and  identifying  complements 
between domains produce higher performance designs. If one is thinking of grading students’  per­
formance,  we  recommend  that  their  work  process  be  considered  as  impor tant  as  the  product  of 
their effor ts.

The Exercise 

To  surface  these  issues,  we  ask  teams  to  present  their  own  designs  to  the  group,  open  the 
ﬂoor  for questions and critique, and  rapidly move  the discussion  from  talking simply abut product 
to  talking  about  process  and  the  relationship  between  product  and  process. From  there,  the  dis­
cussion usually takes on a life of its own and can be dif ﬁcult to stop .
