Introduction

Congratulations! You are now a member of an exper t design team. Your col­
lective task will be to design a new residence suitable for inhabitants of the imagi­
nary Deltoid plane. These written materials, provided to help you prepare for this 
task, are organized in four sections. 

The next section provides an overview of life on the Deltoid plane, DeltaP as it is known to the 
natives.  The  following  section  describes  your  team,  and  the  ﬁnal,  your  design  task.  A  second 
handout,  different  for  each  team member,  provides  the  speciﬁc 
information  you  will  need  to  per­
form  the  role you have been assigned within your  team. Each  team member will contribute differ­
ent  exper tise  to  the  project,  and  each  has  different  design  responsibilities  to  fulﬁll.  All must work 
together for your team to create a  ﬁrst-r ate design. 

1.2  Life on DeltaP 

Life  on DeltaP,  residential  and  otherwise,  is  quite  different  from what  you  have  grown  accus­
tomed to here on Ear th. First off, DeltaP is a plane, not a planet, so your team will be designing in 
two-dimensional  rather  than  three-dimensional  space.  If  your  design  “meets  spec”  and  is  consid­
ered attractive and functional by your Deltan clients, one view on a single sheet of paper will con­
vey to those responsible for constructing it all the information they need to do so.

Life on DeltaP 

The view on this single sheet may not be quite what you expect, however, because in addition 
to lacking a z axis, Deltoid space has unfamiliar relations between the x and y axes as well. What 
we  think  of  as  “per pendicular”  is  hopelessly  skewed  to  a  Deltan,  and  vice-versa.  In  our  units,  a 
right angle on DeltaP measures 60o or  π
/3  radians. Thus all  sides of an equilateral  triangle  form 
lines  considered  perpendicular  to  all  others.  If  there were  such  a  thing  as  a  “circle ”  on DeltaP,  it 
would be composed of only 4π
/3 radians. 

But there is no such thing as a “circle”  on DeltaP, nor even the concept of continuity embodied 
therein. In this  ﬂat  though angular world, residents construct their ar tifacts strictly with discrete tri­
angular forms. Of these, the equilateral triangle -- with its three perpendicular sides (!)-- is consid­
ered  the  most  pleasing.  Accordingly,  your  team  will  design  the  residence  by  assembling  into  a

cluster the most prized building materials on DeltaP, equilateral triangular components called “del­
tas.”  Deltas come in red and blue versions and always measure 2 lyns per side. Four “quar ter-del­
tas”,  QDs, triangular units of area measure with sides of 1 lyn,  ﬁt within a delta. 

Lyns?  QDs?  Not  surprisingly,  Deltan  systems  of  measurement  are  as  unfamiliar  as  that  for 
spatial coordinates. Table 1 summarizes the measurement schemes on DeltaP that you will need 
to know to carry out your design task. 

All of DeltaP’ s units of measure share the divisibility and extensibility conventions of the metric

system; in the measure of time, for example, there are both microwex (µ wx) and megawex (Mwx). 
In relation to the attention-and life-spans of Deltans, these units are roughly equivalent to seconds 
and years, respectively, here on Ear th. 

As  building  components,  deltas  have  functional  and  aesthetic  characteristics  that  are  more 
complex than their simple form and even dimensions would suggest. Especially when assembled 
into  a  cluster,  as  you will  be  doing,  they  behave  in  interesting ways. Deltas  conduct  heat  among 
themselves,  radiate heat  to outer space, melt  if  too hot, and grow  if  too cool. Red deltas produce 
heat.  All  deltas  are  subject  to  DeltaP’ s  two-dimensional  gravity  (which  is  itself  subject  to  axial 
shifts during DeltaP’ s not-infrequent gravity waves). Three different kinds of cement are needed to 
join them together, and joint alignment with respect to gravity affects ease of production as well as

structural  integrity.  Different  colors  and  different  quantities  of  deltas  cost  different  amounts  of 
money per delta, and can be assembled in clusters that are either exceedingly ugly or very attrac­
tive to the Deltans. Your task will be to create a design that meets prescribed goals for all of these 
characteristics. 

1.3  Design Team Roles & Responsibilities 

Your  design  team  is  organized  such  that  each  of  you  will  be  responsible  for  a  subset  of  the 
design goals. One of you will be PROJECT MANAGER. Your main concerns will be with cost and 
schedule, the interpretation and reconciliation of performance speciﬁcations , and negotiations with 
the  contractor  and  client.  You  want  to  keep  costs  and  time-to-build  at  a  minimum,  but  not  at  the 
expense of quality. When your  team submits  its  ﬁnal  design,  the project manager must  repor t  the 
estimated cost (in zwigs) and the time (in wex) that it will take to build. 

Another  of  you will  be  the STRUCTURAL ENGINEER. Your main  concern will  be  to  see  that 
the design  “holds  together ”  as a physical structure under prescribed  loading conditions. You must 
see to it that the two points at which your structure is tied to ground are appropriately chosen and 
that  continuity  of  the  structure  is maintained. When  your  team  submits  its  ﬁnal  design,  the  struc­
tural engineer must attest  to  its  integrity by  identifying  the  strongest and weakest  joints, and esti­
mating the average load on all joints expressed as a percentage of the failure load. 

Another  of  you  will  be  the  THERMAL  ENGINEER.  You  will  want  to  insure  that  the  design 
meets  the  “comf or t-zone”  conditions speciﬁed  in  terms of an average  temperature. You must also 
ensure  that  the  temperature  of  all  individual  deltas  stays within  cer tain  bounds. When  your  team 
submits  its  ﬁnal  design,  the  thermal engineer must estimate  internal  temperature and  identify  the 
hottest and coldest deltas. 

Finally, one of you will be the ARCHITECT. Your concern is with both the form of the design in 
and  of  itself  and  how  it  stands  in  its  setting.  You  must  see  to  it  that  the  interior  of  the  residence 
takes  an  appropriate  form  and  that  egress  is  convenient.  You  should  also  develop  a  design  with 
character. When your  team submits  its  ﬁnal  design,  the architect should be prepared  to present a 
sketch and discuss generally how and why  the Deltans will  ﬁnd  the residence attractive and  func­
tional. The architect will also be asked  to estimate a  few more quantitative measures of architec­
tural performance. 

The  following section describes  the speciﬁcations  that your design must meet  to be accepted 
by your clients on DeltaP. Familiarize yourself with these speciﬁcations . Then, for schooling in your 
specialty, turn to the separate primer you have received that discusses the science and technology 
of  your  domain.  The  primer  contains  the  knowledge  and  heuristics  you  will  need  to  estimate  the 
design parameters for which you are responsible. If you have questions that it does not answer, do 
not hesitate to ask. You should be exper t in your role before your team begins the design phase. 

1.4  The Design Task 

Your Deltan clients have cleared the space shown on the site map and come to your team with 
their  need  for  the  design  of  a  new  residential  cluster.  The  cluster  itself  must  meet  the  following 
speciﬁcations . 

The client wants the cluster to provide a minimum interior area of 100 QDs (Each diamond on 
your girded site map deﬁnes  an area of  two QDs). The shape of  this space, which can of course 
exceed  the  minimum,  is  a  matter  of  design.  The  client  has  expressed  enthusiasm  for  the  newer

mode of segmenting interior space, a mode that breaks with the two-equal-zone tradition and val­
ues the suggested privacy of nooks and crannies. Still the space must be connected,  i.e. no  inte­
rior  walls  can  cut  the  space  into  completely  separate  spaces.  There  must  be  one  and  only  one 
entrance/exit. 

The client is known to be color sensitive blue; too much blue brings on the blues, so to speak. 
No more  than  60%  blue  ought  to  be  allowed;  cer tainly  blue  deltas  are  not  to  exceed  70%  of  the 
cluster. 

The residence, as all clusters, must be anchored at two points and two points only. There is a 
limit to the amount of force each anchor can suppor t, as well as to the amount of internal moment 
each  joint  can  withstand.  Exceeding  either  limit  would  cause  catastrophic  failure  and  send  the 
unwary  residents  tumbling  into  the  void. The  cluster  should be designed  for a  life of  thir ty mega­
wex. Gravity waves, rare but always possible, should be considered. 

The  average  interior  temperature  must  be  kept  within  the  Deltan  comfor t  zone,  which  lies 
between  55  and  65  oNin.  The  temperature  of  the  elements  themselves  must  be  kept  above  the 
growth  point  of  20  oNn  and  below  the melt-down  point  of  85  oNn. Delta  temperatures  outside  of 
this range will result in catastrophic structural failure with little more warning than excessive load. 

All  of  this  -- design,  fabrication  and  construction  -- must  be  done  under  a  ﬁ xed  budget  and 
within  a  given  time  period.  At  your  team  meeting  you  are  to  develop  a  conceptual  design  that 
meets or exceeds all design goals. When each team submits their design, individual members will 
be asked to repor t design performance on parameters for which they are responsible.

1.1 

Introduction

 As architect, your concern is with the intrinsic form and function of your 
team's design, as well as how it relates to the site. When your team submits its 
ﬁnal  design, you should be prepared to discuss how and why the Deltans will ﬁnd 
the residence attractive and functional. You will also be asked to repor t some 
more quantitative architectural measures discussed below. 

1.2  Function Follows Form 

As simple as  the  fundamental building elements appear, quite complex,  intricate and angular 
form can be composed out of deltas. As architect, it is your responsibility to create design that not 
only meets  the clients' physical needs but  in some way stands as an expression of  their vision of 
themselves and their community.

You  read  this  vision  as  a  vision  of  progress  and  innovation.  You  imagine  a  form  that,  while 
rooted  in  tradition, suggests a reaching out  toward  the unknown. Tradition has valued  the angular 
exterior  facade.  You  want  to  experiment  with  the  smooth.  Perhaps  a  rhythmic  alternation  of  a

Coming more into vogue is the angular interior. There is some kind of reversal going on here. 
The interior traditionally has been made smooth, to maximize interaction ad communication. Now­
adays privacy has become a common word in architectural discourse. While an argument can be 
made  that  the use of deltas  to shape  interior nooks and crannies  is an  inefﬁcient  use of  this one 
resource, you think that this  is a shor t-sighted view even though  it  is a view  “ rationally”  argued by 
your engineering colleagues. 

Your  clients want  to  go  even  fur ther.  They  seem  to want  some  kind  of  “fr actal”  interior  -- not 
just  one  space  with  nooks  and  crannies  but  sub-spaces  which  themselves  suggest  nooks  and 
crannies.  This  is  all  very  fuzzy  in  your  mind  but  you  are  keen  to  experiment  and  have  star ted 
sketching. 

At  the  same  time,  you  are  keen  to  economize  on  space  designated  for  circulation within  the 
interior.  You  want,  in  other  words,  to  maximize  functional  space.  Note  that  a  quar ter-delta  is  an 
area within which three inhabitants could stand and talk comfor tably, one to another. Several lyns 
are then required for circulation cross-section, not only within the interior but also at the entrance. 

The  single  entrance/exit  is  conventionally  aligned  with  the  force  ﬁeld  and  “upstream”  as 
viewed from outside; that is, one enters the cluster moving forward, in the direction of gravitational 
pull.  This  is  so  because  Deltans  are  themselves  subject  to  gravity.  They  have  evolved  over  the 
many gigawex of their existence to the point where they now are able to maneuver in any direction 
without conscious attention to the force  ﬁeld.  However, the entrance to most clusters is located so 
that the residents would fall  into rather than out of the cluster  if they were to  lose this sense. This 
orientation is essential during passage of a gravity wave. 

As noted in the description of the design task, your client is blue sensitive. While the allowable 
dosage of blue deltas in the environs is no set number, you conjecture that the blues ought not to 
constitute more than 60% of the elements. Dispersion of the blues is preferred as well, so that res­
idents are not confronted with seemingly endless blue vistas when viewing the interior. 

1.3  Some Quantitative Measures 

Although the Deltans will ultimately  judge the quality of your work by stepping back and cast­
ing  a  critical  eye  at  the  overall  design,  they  have  also  requested  that  you  provide  some  simple 
measures of design quality. These measures, and  the methods  to use  to  ﬁgure  them, are as  fol­
lows:

   DELTA DESIGN 

Some Quantitative Measures 

• Internal Area: Estimate the internal area (in QDs) by using the grid on the site map. 
Each diamond has an area of 2 QDs. 

• Blueness: Calculate the blueness of your design by ﬁgur ing out how many of the del­
tas used are blue, expressed as a percentage of the total. 

• Blue Dispersion: Count the total number of joints between deltas where either or 
both are blue. Now count how many of these do not join two blues, and express the 
result as a percentage of the total. 100% would mean you had achieved perfect dis­
persion. 

• I/E Perimeter Ratio: Measure the interior and exterior wall lengths in lyns and divide 
the interior length by the exterior. Because a craggy wall will be longer than a smooth 
one, the higher this ratio is, the better you have met the clients desires discussed 
above. Cer tainly this ratio should be greater than 1. 

A  ﬁnal  note:  unless  told  by  the  instructor  that  you  will  be  remodeling  the  clients' existing  resi­
dence rather than designing an entirely new one, you as architect are responsible for putting forward 
an initial conﬁguration f or consideration by your design team.
