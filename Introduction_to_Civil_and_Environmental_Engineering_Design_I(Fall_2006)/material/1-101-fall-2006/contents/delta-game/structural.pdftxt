Introduction 

Copyright 1991 MIT 

Congratulations! You are now a member of an exper t design team. Your col­
lective task will be to design a new residence suitable for inhabitants of the imagi­
nary Deltoid plane. These written materials, provided to help you prepare for this 
task, are organized in four sections. 

The next section provides an overview of life on the Deltoid plane, DeltaP as it is known to the 
natives.  The  following  section  describes  your  team,  and  the  ﬁnal,  your  design  task.  A  second 
handout,  different  for  each  team member,  provides  the  speciﬁc 
information  you  will  need  to  per­
form  the  role you have been assigned within your  team. Each  team member will contribute differ­
ent  exper tise  to  the  project,  and  each  has  different  design  responsibilities  to  fulﬁll.  All must work 
together for your team to create a  ﬁrst-r ate design. 

1.2  Life on DeltaP 

Life  on DeltaP,  residential  and  otherwise,  is  quite  different  from what  you  have  grown  accus­
tomed to here on Ear th. First off, DeltaP is a plane, not a planet, so your team will be designing in 
two-dimensional  rather  than  three-dimensional  space.  If  your  design  “meets  spec”  and  is  consid­
ered attractive and functional by your Deltan clients, one view on a single sheet of paper will con­
vey to those responsible for constructing it all the information they need to do so.

Life on DeltaP 

The view on this single sheet may not be quite what you expect, however, because in addition 
to lacking a z axis, Deltoid space has unfamiliar relations between the x and y axes as well. What 
we  think  of  as  “per pendicular”  is  hopelessly  skewed  to  a  Deltan,  and  vice-versa.  In  our  units,  a 
right angle on DeltaP measures 60o or  π
/3  radians. Thus all  sides of an equilateral  triangle  form 
lines  considered  perpendicular  to  all  others.  If  there were  such  a  thing  as  a  “circle ”  on DeltaP,  it 
would be composed of only 4π
/3 radians. 

But there is no such thing as a “circle”  on DeltaP, nor even the concept of continuity embodied 
therein. In this  ﬂat  though angular world, residents construct their ar tifacts strictly with discrete tri­
angular forms. Of these, the equilateral triangle -- with its three perpendicular sides (!)-- is consid­
ered  the  most  pleasing.  Accordingly,  your  team  will  design  the  residence  by  assembling  into  a

cluster the most prized building materials on DeltaP, equilateral triangular components called “del­
tas.”  Deltas come in red and blue versions and always measure 2 lyns per side. Four “quar ter-del­
tas”,  QDs, triangular units of area measure with sides of 1 lyn,  ﬁt within a delta. 

Lyns?  QDs?  Not  surprisingly,  Deltan  systems  of  measurement  are  as  unfamiliar  as  that  for 
spatial coordinates. Table 1 summarizes the measurement schemes on DeltaP that you will need 
to know to carry out your design task. 

All of DeltaP’ s units of measure share the divisibility and extensibility conventions of the metric

system; in the measure of time, for example, there are both microwex (µ wx) and megawex (Mwx). 
In relation to the attention-and life-spans of Deltans, these units are roughly equivalent to seconds 
and years, respectively, here on Ear th. 

As  building  components,  deltas  have  functional  and  aesthetic  characteristics  that  are  more 
complex than their simple form and even dimensions would suggest. Especially when assembled 
into  a  cluster,  as  you will  be  doing,  they  behave  in  interesting ways. Deltas  conduct  heat  among 
themselves,  radiate heat  to outer space, melt  if  too hot, and grow  if  too cool. Red deltas produce 
heat.  All  deltas  are  subject  to  DeltaP’ s  two-dimensional  gravity  (which  is  itself  subject  to  axial 
shifts during DeltaP’ s not-infrequent gravity waves). Three different kinds of cement are needed to 
join them together, and joint alignment with respect to gravity affects ease of production as well as

structural  integrity.  Different  colors  and  different  quantities  of  deltas  cost  different  amounts  of 
money per delta, and can be assembled in clusters that are either exceedingly ugly or very attrac­
tive to the Deltans. Your task will be to create a design that meets prescribed goals for all of these 
characteristics. 

1.3  Design Team Roles & Responsibilities 

Your  design  team  is  organized  such  that  each  of  you  will  be  responsible  for  a  subset  of  the 
design goals. One of you will be PROJECT MANAGER. Your main concerns will be with cost and 
schedule, the interpretation and reconciliation of performance speciﬁcations , and negotiations with 
the  contractor  and  client.  You  want  to  keep  costs  and  time-to-build  at  a  minimum,  but  not  at  the 
expense of quality. When your  team submits  its  ﬁnal  design,  the project manager must  repor t  the 
estimated cost (in zwigs) and the time (in wex) that it will take to build. 

Another  of  you will  be  the STRUCTURAL ENGINEER. Your main  concern will  be  to  see  that 
the design  “holds  together ”  as a physical structure under prescribed  loading conditions. You must 
see to it that the two points at which your structure is tied to ground are appropriately chosen and 
that  continuity  of  the  structure  is maintained. When  your  team  submits  its  ﬁnal  design,  the  struc­
tural engineer must attest  to  its  integrity by  identifying  the  strongest and weakest  joints, and esti­
mating the average load on all joints expressed as a percentage of the failure load. 

Another  of  you  will  be  the  THERMAL  ENGINEER.  You  will  want  to  insure  that  the  design 
meets  the  “comf or t-zone”  conditions speciﬁed  in  terms of an average  temperature. You must also 
ensure  that  the  temperature  of  all  individual  deltas  stays within  cer tain  bounds. When  your  team 
submits  its  ﬁnal  design,  the  thermal engineer must estimate  internal  temperature and  identify  the 
hottest and coldest deltas. 

Finally, one of you will be the ARCHITECT. Your concern is with both the form of the design in 
and  of  itself  and  how  it  stands  in  its  setting.  You  must  see  to  it  that  the  interior  of  the  residence 
takes  an  appropriate  form  and  that  egress  is  convenient.  You  should  also  develop  a  design  with 
character. When your  team submits  its  ﬁnal  design,  the architect should be prepared  to present a 
sketch and discuss generally how and why  the Deltans will  ﬁnd  the residence attractive and  func­
tional. The architect will also be asked  to estimate a  few more quantitative measures of architec­
tural performance. 

The  following section describes  the speciﬁcations  that your design must meet  to be accepted 
by your clients on DeltaP. Familiarize yourself with these speciﬁcations . Then, for schooling in your 
specialty, turn to the separate primer you have received that discusses the science and technology 
of  your  domain.  The  primer  contains  the  knowledge  and  heuristics  you  will  need  to  estimate  the 
design parameters for which you are responsible. If you have questions that it does not answer, do 
not hesitate to ask. You should be exper t in your role before your team begins the design phase. 

1.4  The Design Task 

Your Deltan clients have cleared the space shown on the site map and come to your team with 
their  need  for  the  design  of  a  new  residential  cluster.  The  cluster  itself  must  meet  the  following 
speciﬁcations . 

The client wants the cluster to provide a minimum interior area of 100 QDs (Each diamond on 
your girded site map deﬁnes  an area of  two QDs). The shape of  this space, which can of course 
exceed  the  minimum,  is  a  matter  of  design.  The  client  has  expressed  enthusiasm  for  the  newer 

DELTA DESIGN

mode of segmenting interior space, a mode that breaks with the two-equal-zone tradition and val­
ues the suggested privacy of nooks and crannies. Still the space must be connected,  i.e. no  inte­
rior  walls  can  cut  the  space  into  completely  separate  spaces.  There  must  be  one  and  only  one 
entrance/exit. 

The client is known to be color sensitive blue; too much blue brings on the blues, so to speak. 
No more  than  60%  blue  ought  to  be  allowed;  cer tainly  blue  deltas  are  not  to  exceed  70%  of  the 
cluster. 

The residence, as all clusters, must be anchored at two points and two points only. There is a 
limit to the amount of force each anchor can suppor t, as well as to the amount of internal moment 
each  joint  can  withstand.  Exceeding  either  limit  would  cause  catastrophic  failure  and  send  the 
unwary  residents  tumbling  into  the  void. The  cluster  should be designed  for a  life of  thir ty mega­
wex. Gravity waves, rare but always possible, should be considered. 

The  average  interior  temperature  must  be  kept  within  the  Deltan  comfor t  zone,  which  lies 
between  55  and  65  oNin.  The  temperature  of  the  elements  themselves  must  be  kept  above  the 
growth  point  of  20  oNn  and  below  the melt-down  point  of  85  oNn. Delta  temperatures  outside  of 
this range will result in catastrophic structural failure with little more warning than excessive load. 

All  of  this  -- design,  fabrication  and  construction  -- must  be  done  under  a  ﬁ xed  budget  and 
within  a  given  time  period.  At  your  team  meeting  you  are  to  develop  a  conceptual  design  that 
meets or exceeds all design goals. When each team submits their design, individual members will 
be asked to repor t design performance on parameters for which they are responsible.

1.1 

Introduction 

As structural engineer, you are responsible for the physical integrity and 
robustness of your team ’ s design. You must insure that the residence you propose 
will hold together under prescribed loading conditions. You should see to it that 
the two points at which your structure is anchored to the plane are appropriately 
chosen, that all joints are sufﬁciently  strong, and that the overall shape of the clus­
ter does not violate sound structural engineering practice. You should also strive 
for an elegant and ef ﬁcient design, one that pro vides the requisite strength and 
durability with minimum costs and materials. 

When your team submits its  ﬁnal  design, you will be asked to attest to its quality by explaining 
the location of the anchors, identifying the strongest and weakest joints, and estimating, as a mea­
sure of robustness,  the average  load on all  joints expressed as a percentage of  failure  loads. You 
may be asked  to predict what will happen  to your design during  the next gravity wave.This primer 
will give you the tools, essentially the methods of static equilibrium analysis, with which to do your 
work. It assumes you have read the introduction to the Delta design exercise. 

1.2  The Gravitational Field — The Center of Gra vity 

A uni-directional, gravitational  force  ﬁeld  acts on each delta  in  the plane. The direction of  this 
force is parallel to the y axis shown on the site map and in the  ﬁgures .

The Gravitational Field — The Center of Gra vity 

Each  delta  experiences  a  force  of  one  din.  Thus  for  the  cluster  of  24  elements  shown  in  the 
ﬁgure , we can say 

• that it has a total weight of 24 dins, and 

• that the resulting force due to Deltan gravity acts in the plane along a line parallel to 
the y axis and running through the cluster ’ s center of gravity, as shown. 

The  structure  is  kept  stationary  despite  this  force  by  offsetting  reaction  forces  at  the  anchors, 
marked in the  ﬁgure as points  A and B. 

The  ﬁrst  step in structural analysis is to locate the cluster’ s center of gravity (CG). For our ini­
tial purposes, we actually only need the CG’ s x coordinate, which gives us the line of action of the 
gravity force shown on the previous page. We do not need to know the y coordinate until we con­
sider DeltaP ’ s recurrent gravity waves, which ﬂip  gravity between axes, and when the time comes, 
you  can  determine  it  by  similarly  ﬂipping 
the  following  moment  equilibrium  calculation.  You  may 
also use the moment equilibrium technique to locate the CG of any subsection of a cluster. 

There are two things to keep in mind throughout your calculations. First, keep them as simple 
as possible. Work only  in  integers, always  rounding up or down and estimating distances,  forces 
and moments to the nearest lyn, din, or lyn-din respectively. 

Second,  keep  in mind  the  peculiarities  of  Deltan  space,  where  “per pendicular”  describes  an 
arc measuring only 60 degrees or π
/3 radians in our units, and where distance measurements are 
made only along  lines parallel to the axes. On DeltaP, the distance between anchors A and B, for  
example, measures 10 lyns, as shown in the previous  ﬁgure . 

This  distinction  is  critical  in  the  calculation  of  moment,  the  turning  effect  of  a  force  about  a 
point. As on Ear th, moment is still the product of the force and its distance from the point, but the 
distance must be measured in Deltan space. The moment that force RFA exer ts about point B, for  
example,  is  the  product  of  the  distance  in  lyns,  measured  parallel  to  the  x  axis,  from  the  line  of 
action of RFA  to anchor B (10  lyns), and  force RFA measured  in dins. Not surprisingly, moment, 
M, is measured in lyn-dins, abbreviated LD: 

M (RFA about B), in lyn-dins = 10 lyns XRFA dins 

Now,  ﬁnding  the CG. Using our knowledge that, in static equilibrium, all moments around any

given point will sum  to zero, we can  ﬁnd  a cluster’ s CG  in  reference  to any delta, call  it  the  ith, by

equating the sum of moments around it generated by gravity acting on each individual delta to the 
moment of the entire cluster around it: 

N 

(  f  ×  D i j
j  = 1 

)  =  N  ×  f  ×

, D i c g

where: 

• N is the number of deltas in the cluster ; 

• f is the gravity force experience by each delta, equal to 1; 

• Dij, is the distance between the ith and each other delta; 

• Di,cg is the distance between the  ith delta and the CG’ s line of action du to gravity. 

Simplifying and solving for Di,cg gives us:

∑  D i j

, 

So  ﬁnding  the CG’ s x coordinate is as simple as summing up the distances between any delta 
and all others, dividing by  the  total number of deltas, and adding  the  result  to  the  x  coordinate of 
the  delta  used  as  a  reference.  Just  be  sure  to  adhere  to  Deltan  measurement  technique,  and 
express distances  to  the  left and  right of  the  reference as negative and positive numbers  respec­
tively. 

In  the example shown  in  the  ﬁgure ,  the distances  from  the  ith  delta sum  to 102  lyns. Dividing 
by N=24 gives us 4 lyns, which we then count over, and viola, we have the location of the CG’ s line 
of action of the force due to gravity. Call this the CG LOA. 

1.3  Estimating Support Loads 

Each of the two anchors has sufﬁcient  strength to suppor t a load of 20 dins. They can resist no 
twisting effect, no moment, about  their axes,  i.e.  they act as  frictionless pins holding  the cluster  in 
place. To estimate the suppor t loads that they will be subject to,  ﬁrst  sum up the total force due to 
gravity acting on all deltas  in  the cluster. We know  that  this  force, measured  in dins as discussed 
above, is equal to the total number of elements N since each element experiences a force of 1 din. 
We also know that, for equilibrium, the two reaction forces at the anchors, marked on the  ﬁgure  as 
RFA and RFB must also sum to this total force: 
RFA + RFB = N X f = 24 dins 

We need a  second equation  to  solve  for  the  reaction  forces, which we  can get by  calculating 
the moment equilibrium of  the entire cluster with reference to either anchor. We will use anchor B

as a  reference.  In Deltan equilibrium analysis  lingo  —  we  take moments about point B. Referring

to the ﬁgure , assume that a positive moment acts to rotate the cluster counter-clockwise. Measure 
the  distance  from  the CG  LOA  to  anchor  B:  these  3  lyns  are  the  distance  over which  the  24  din 
gravity force acting on the entire cluster creates a moment about B. 

Since we  know  that,  in  equilibrium,  the  (positive) moment  of RFA  about  anchor  B must  bal­
ance the (negative) moment of the entire cluster about B, we have that: 

10 lyns X RFA - (24 dins X 3 lyns) =0 
We solve for RFA 
RFA = 72 lyn-dins/ 10 lyns = 7 dins 
And, with the  ﬁrst equation, f or RFB 
RFB = 24 - RFA= 17 dins 

Since anchors can withstand 20 dins, anchor A  is  in  ﬁne  shape. Anchor B, however, only has 
a safety margin of 20/17, or roughly 1.2. This is ok, but you won’t  win awards for robustness. Can 
you see how to relocate the anchors for a better balance of reaction forces? 

1.4 

Internal Moments and Fastener Requirements 

Adjacent elements are held together by cement. The cement is necessary because otherwise 
the  structure  could not  suppor t  the  internal  forces and moments, again due  to gravitational  load­
ing.  T  internal moment  is  the most  critical  of  these. Although  the  strength  of  the  cement  varies  by 
supplier, your source has cer tiﬁed  hers at 20 LD per  lyn of  contact,  resulting  in  the  linear  relation­
ship between length and strength shown in the  ﬁgure  below. A fully overlapped joint fastened with 

Joint Length = 0.5 lyn 
Maximum Moment = 10 LD

this cement will have a maximum allowable internal moment of 40 lyn-dins.

   DELTA DESIGN 

Internal Moments and Fastener Requirements 

Given  this  length-strength  relationship,  how  do we  estimate  the  actual  internal moments  that 
joints will experience and must withstand? Simply treat each joint as the boundary of a subcluster, 
and derive the moment at the joint from the equation for moment equilibrium of this subcluster. For

the subcluster shown  in  the  ﬁgure  the moment at  the  intersection of deltas  i and  j, denoted Mij  is 
found in the following steps: 

• ﬁnd  the sub-cluster’ s CG LOA and its distance from the joint: here, about 2 or 3 lyns; 

• ﬁnd  the force exer ted due to gravity by the subcluster, a quantity equal to the number 
of deltas in t: here 8 dins; 

• ﬁnd the product, which giv es us the moment of the subcluster about the joint; 

•if the subcluster contains any anchor points, ﬁgure  the moments of resulting reaction 
forces around the joint; in this case, we know that RFA=7 dins, and measure the dis­
tance as 4 lyns; 

• taking moments about the joint as positive if they tend to rotate the section clock­
wise, express the fact that for equilibrium the sum of all the moments must be zero: 

Mij + (moment of subcluster about joint) - (moment of RFA about joint) =0 

• solve for Mij 

Mij = (moment of RFA about joint) - (moment of subcluster about joint) 

So in our case, we get 

Mij =(7din x 4 lyn)-(8 dn x 2 or 3 lyn) = 12 or 4 LD. 

This sounds pretty tame, since the joint is fully overlapped and can withstand 40 LD. In fact, it 
sounds like a waste of cement, because a joint 25% shor ter would still provide a hefty safety mar­
gin. 

With  these  same  six  steps,  we  can  estimate  the  internal  moment  at  any  joint  we  choose  to 
examine, and compare it to the strength of the joint.

Gravity Waves 

1.5  Gravity Waves 

Finally, although  the gravitational  force across  the Deltoid plane  is  forever constant  in magni­
tude,  the  rare  but  inevitable  gravity  wave  will,  when  it  comes,  instantaneously  shift  its  direction 
or thogonally;  from  that of  the y axis shown on  the site map  to  that of  the x axis. Gravity will  then 
retain  that  direction  until  the  next wave  arrives  and  causes  it  to  shift  back.  The  ﬁgure  shows  the 
change in internal moment that the joint just discussed would undergo in the event of such a wave. 
We now obtain 

Mij = (12 dins X 4 lyns) - (7 dins X 3 lyns) = 27 LD 

which is signiﬁcantly  greater than the value previously obtained. Note that the reaction force at the 
anchor point has changed as well.

The  last  gravity  wave  passed  through  about  40  megawex  (Mwx)  ago,  causing  widespread

a  Poisson  process  with  a 
mean  arrival  time  of  80  Mwx.  The  statistics  are  generally  considered  “good ”  only  for  the  past 
gigawex or so, and myths of old suggest that but ten Mwx separated two waves at the time of the 
ﬂood. Should y ou worry about it?
