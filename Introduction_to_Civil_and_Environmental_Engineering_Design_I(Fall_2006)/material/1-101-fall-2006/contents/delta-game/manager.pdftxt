Introduction 

Copyright 1991 MIT 

Congratulations! You are now a member of an exper t design team. Your col­
lective task will be to design a new residence suitable for inhabitants of the imagi­
nary Deltoid plane. These written materials, provided to help you prepare for this 
task, are organized in four sections. 

The next section provides an overview of life on the Deltoid plane, DeltaP as it is known to the 
natives.  The  following  section  describes  your  team,  and  the  ﬁnal,  your  design  task.  A  second 
handout,  different  for  each  team member,  provides  the  speciﬁc 
information  you  will  need  to  per­
form  the  role you have been assigned within your  team. Each  team member will contribute differ­
ent  exper tise  to  the  project,  and  each  has  different  design  responsibilities  to  fulﬁll.  All must work 
together for your team to create a  ﬁrst-r ate design. 

1.2  Life on DeltaP 

Life  on DeltaP,  residential  and  otherwise,  is  quite  different  from what  you  have  grown  accus­
tomed to here on Ear th. First off, DeltaP is a plane, not a planet, so your team will be designing in 
two-dimensional  rather  than  three-dimensional  space.  If  your  design  “meets  spec”  and  is  consid­
ered attractive and functional by your Deltan clients, one view on a single sheet of paper will con­
vey to those responsible for constructing it all the information they need to do so.

Life on DeltaP 

The view on this single sheet may not be quite what you expect, however, because in addition 
to lacking a z axis, Deltoid space has unfamiliar relations between the x and y axes as well. What 
we  think  of  as  “per pendicular”  is  hopelessly  skewed  to  a  Deltan,  and  vice-versa.  In  our  units,  a 
right angle on DeltaP measures 60o or  π
/3  radians. Thus all  sides of an equilateral  triangle  form 
lines  considered  perpendicular  to  all  others.  If  there were  such  a  thing  as  a  “circle ”  on DeltaP,  it 
would be composed of only 4π
/3 radians. 

But there is no such thing as a “circle”  on DeltaP, nor even the concept of continuity embodied 
therein. In this  ﬂat  though angular world, residents construct their ar tifacts strictly with discrete tri­
angular forms. Of these, the equilateral triangle -- with its three perpendicular sides (!)-- is consid­
ered  the  most  pleasing.  Accordingly,  your  team  will  design  the  residence  by  assembling  into  a

cluster the most prized building materials on DeltaP, equilateral triangular components called “del­
tas.”  Deltas come in red and blue versions and always measure 2 lyns per side. Four “quar ter-del­
tas”,  QDs, triangular units of area measure with sides of 1 lyn,  ﬁt within a delta. 

Lyns?  QDs?  Not  surprisingly,  Deltan  systems  of  measurement  are  as  unfamiliar  as  that  for 
spatial coordinates. Table 1 summarizes the measurement schemes on DeltaP that you will need 
to know to carry out your design task. 

All of DeltaP’ s units of measure share the divisibility and extensibility conventions of the metric

system; in the measure of time, for example, there are both microwex (µ wx) and megawex (Mwx). 
In relation to the attention-and life-spans of Deltans, these units are roughly equivalent to seconds 
and years, respectively, here on Ear th. 

As  building  components,  deltas  have  functional  and  aesthetic  characteristics  that  are  more 
complex than their simple form and even dimensions would suggest. Especially when assembled 
into  a  cluster,  as  you will  be  doing,  they  behave  in  interesting ways. Deltas  conduct  heat  among 
themselves,  radiate heat  to outer space, melt  if  too hot, and grow  if  too cool. Red deltas produce 
heat.  All  deltas  are  subject  to  DeltaP’ s  two-dimensional  gravity  (which  is  itself  subject  to  axial 
shifts during DeltaP’ s not-infrequent gravity waves). Three different kinds of cement are needed to 
join them together, and joint alignment with respect to gravity affects ease of production as well as

structural  integrity.  Different  colors  and  different  quantities  of  deltas  cost  different  amounts  of 
money per delta, and can be assembled in clusters that are either exceedingly ugly or very attrac­
tive to the Deltans. Your task will be to create a design that meets prescribed goals for all of these 
characteristics. 

1.3  Design Team Roles & Responsibilities 

Your  design  team  is  organized  such  that  each  of  you  will  be  responsible  for  a  subset  of  the 
design goals. One of you will be PROJECT MANAGER. Your main concerns will be with cost and 
schedule, the interpretation and reconciliation of performance speciﬁcations , and negotiations with 
the  contractor  and  client.  You  want  to  keep  costs  and  time-to-build  at  a  minimum,  but  not  at  the 
expense of quality. When your  team submits  its  ﬁnal  design,  the project manager must  repor t  the 
estimated cost (in zwigs) and the time (in wex) that it will take to build. 

Another  of  you will  be  the STRUCTURAL ENGINEER. Your main  concern will  be  to  see  that 
the design  “holds  together ”  as a physical structure under prescribed  loading conditions. You must 
see to it that the two points at which your structure is tied to ground are appropriately chosen and 
that  continuity  of  the  structure  is maintained. When  your  team  submits  its  ﬁnal  design,  the  struc­
tural engineer must attest  to  its  integrity by  identifying  the  strongest and weakest  joints, and esti­
mating the average load on all joints expressed as a percentage of the failure load. 

Another  of  you  will  be  the  THERMAL  ENGINEER.  You  will  want  to  insure  that  the  design 
meets  the  “comf or t-zone”  conditions speciﬁed  in  terms of an average  temperature. You must also 
ensure  that  the  temperature  of  all  individual  deltas  stays within  cer tain  bounds. When  your  team 
submits  its  ﬁnal  design,  the  thermal engineer must estimate  internal  temperature and  identify  the 
hottest and coldest deltas. 

Finally, one of you will be the ARCHITECT. Your concern is with both the form of the design in 
and  of  itself  and  how  it  stands  in  its  setting.  You  must  see  to  it  that  the  interior  of  the  residence 
takes  an  appropriate  form  and  that  egress  is  convenient.  You  should  also  develop  a  design  with 
character. When your  team submits  its  ﬁnal  design,  the architect should be prepared  to present a 
sketch and discuss generally how and why  the Deltans will  ﬁnd  the residence attractive and  func­
tional. The architect will also be asked  to estimate a  few more quantitative measures of architec­
tural performance. 

The  following section describes  the speciﬁcations  that your design must meet  to be accepted 
by your clients on DeltaP. Familiarize yourself with these speciﬁcations . Then, for schooling in your 
specialty, turn to the separate primer you have received that discusses the science and technology 
of  your  domain.  The  primer  contains  the  knowledge  and  heuristics  you  will  need  to  estimate  the 
design parameters for which you are responsible. If you have questions that it does not answer, do 
not hesitate to ask. You should be exper t in your role before your team begins the design phase. 

1.4  The Design Task 

Your Deltan clients have cleared the space shown on the site map and come to your team with 
their  need  for  the  design  of  a  new  residential  cluster.  The  cluster  itself  must  meet  the  following 
speciﬁcations . 

The client wants the cluster to provide a minimum interior area of 100 QDs (Each diamond on 
your girded site map deﬁnes  an area of  two QDs). The shape of  this space, which can of course 
exceed  the  minimum,  is  a  matter  of  design.  The  client  has  expressed  enthusiasm  for  the  newer

mode of segmenting interior space, a mode that breaks with the two-equal-zone tradition and val­
ues the suggested privacy of nooks and crannies. Still the space must be connected,  i.e. no  inte­
rior  walls  can  cut  the  space  into  completely  separate  spaces.  There  must  be  one  and  only  one 
entrance/exit. 

The client is known to be color sensitive blue; too much blue brings on the blues, so to speak. 
No more  than  60%  blue  ought  to  be  allowed;  cer tainly  blue  deltas  are  not  to  exceed  70%  of  the 
cluster. 

The residence, as all clusters, must be anchored at two points and two points only. There is a 
limit to the amount of force each anchor can suppor t, as well as to the amount of internal moment 
each  joint  can  withstand.  Exceeding  either  limit  would  cause  catastrophic  failure  and  send  the 
unwary  residents  tumbling  into  the  void. The  cluster  should be designed  for a  life of  thir ty mega­
wex. Gravity waves, rare but always possible, should be considered. 

The  average  interior  temperature  must  be  kept  within  the  Deltan  comfor t  zone,  which  lies 
between  55  and  65  oNin.  The  temperature  of  the  elements  themselves  must  be  kept  above  the 
growth  point  of  20  oNn  and  below  the melt-down  point  of  85  oNn. Delta  temperatures  outside  of 
this range will result in catastrophic structural failure with little more warning than excessive load. 

All  of  this  -- design,  fabrication  and  construction  -- must  be  done  under  a  ﬁ xed  budget  and 
within  a  given  time  period.  At  your  team  meeting  you  are  to  develop  a  conceptual  design  that 
meets or exceeds all design goals. When each team submits their design, individual members will 
be asked to repor t design performance on parameters for which they are responsible.

1.1 

Introduction 

As project manager, your main concerns are cost and schedule, the interpre­
tation and reconciliation of performance speciﬁcations , and negotiations with con­
tractor and client. You want to keep costs and time-to-build at a minimum, but not 
at the expense of quality. When your team submits its ﬁnal design, y ou must 
repor t the cost and time that you estimate will be required to build it. These esti­
mates will be in zwigs (!) and wex, respectively. 

As  an  experienced  project manager,  you  know  that  all  speciﬁcations  are  prone  to  slip  during 
the conceptual design phase, and that budget and schedule, your speciﬁc  responsibilities, are the 
most  vulnerable. You have already  realized  that both are  likely  to be binding  constraints, and  fur­
ther,  that  the Deltans  are  tight with  a  zwig  and  anxious  to move  in.  Like  clients  everywhere,  they 
desire a better residence then they can comfor tably afford. 

1.2  Estimating Project Costs 

Your  job of estimating project cost has been greatly simpliﬁed  by  ﬁnding  a supplier-contractor 
that  quotes material  costs  inclusive  of  delivery  and most  assembly  charges.  The  cost  schedules 
presented below for buying deltas and the cement needed to glue them together thus reﬂect  near-
ﬁnal  costs, with  two  impor tant exceptions. One source of additional cost comes  from  the modular 
construction  techniques  used  on DeltaP: material  prices  cover  the  labor  cost  to  assemble  deltas 
into modules, which is done at the factory, but not the on-site cost of positioning and joining these 
modules  into  the  ﬁnal  structure.  The  second  additional  cost  is  overhead,  which  covers,  among 
many other things, the cost of paying your design team. 

To estimate the cost of your team’ s design: 

• ﬁgure the cost of the deltas used; 

• ﬁgure the cost of the cement needed to joint them; 

• ﬁgure  the number of modules and the cost to join them; sum all these up and multiply 
by the overhead rate. 

To estimate how long it will take to construct your design:

• identify the separate modules; 

• determine how long it will take to construct each one; 

• determine how long it will take to assemble them at the site; 

• sum these up. 

1.3  Delta Costs 

The cost of deltas varies by color and quantity purchased. The price break for blue deltas is at 
16 units: blues cost !10 apiece  if fewer than 16 are purchased, !6 for 16 or more. The price break 
for  red  deltas  is  at  20  units:  reds  cost  !8  each  if  fewer  than  20  are  purchased,  !6  for  20  or more. 
These costs are shown in Schedule 1.

Schedule  2  illustrates  how  the  total  cost  of  deltas  purchased  varies  with  color  composition. 
The y axis shows total ! cost and the x axis show the number of red deltas used. The three graphs 
show the color-mix variance in total delta costs for structures using a total of 30, 40, and 50 deltas, 
respectively.  This  schedule  can  help  you  calculate  the  most  economical  color  mix  for  a  given 
structure size.

1.3.1  Cement Costs 

You will need to purchase three different types of cement, at three different costs, to assemble 
deltas into your structure. Three types --R2, B2, and RB -- are required because different types of 
joints require different types of cement. R2  (pronounced  “r  squared”)  is the red-red binder needed 

6

   DELTA DESIGN 

Delta Costs 

to  bond  one  red  delta  to  another  red  delta.  RB,  the  most  expensive,  is  the  red-blue  binder  that 
bonds a red delta to a blue delta. Finally, B2  is the least expensive and bonds two blue deltas. The 
following costs apply; 

TABLE 1. 

Cement Costs 

Cement Unit Costs 
R2 
!10 / lyn 
!20 / lyn 
RB 
B2 
!5 / lyn 

Note that the cost of fastening one delta to another will be determined by the length of contact 
between  elements  as  well  as  by  their  respective  colors:  the  longer  the  joint,  the  more  glue  is 
required. A  fully overlapped 2  lyn  joint between a  red and a blue delta will cost  !40; hardly pocket 
change.

1.3.2  Module Joining Costs 

Should  your  team’ s  design  be  selected,  construction  will  proceed  in  two  stages.  In  the  ﬁrst 
stage, individual deltas are joined into modules. This takes place at the factory, where the supplier 
ﬁr m has developed  jigs and  ﬁxtures  that simplify the task, allowing them to accurately predict and 
therefore include the costs in the quoted prices for deltas.

The  individual  modules  into  which  a  given  structure  will  be  decomposed  and  constructed  at 
the factory are easy to identify, because the boundaries between them are deﬁned  by the orienta­
tion of the joints relative to gravity. To an ear thly eye, any intersection of two deltas that runs left to 
right, across the page, is a module boundary. The  ﬁgure  shows how this works. The design has 3 
such joints, and therefore 4 modules. 

When  all  modules  are  complete,  they  are  transpor ted  to  the  site,  joined  together,  and 
anchored  to  the plane. This on-site work  is more dif ﬁcult  to  cost out  in advance,  so  the  client will 
essentially  have  to  pay  whatever  costs  are  incurred.  Your  experienced  contractor,  however,  has 
told you that her rule of thumb for predicting them is to  ﬁgure  the cost of glue needed for the mod-

ule-to-module  joints and double  it. Thus  the approximate on-site cost  to  joint Modules 1 and 2  in 
the  ﬁgure  could  be  estimated  as  1  lyn  of  length  times  !5  per  lyn  of  BB  cement  times  2,  or  !10. 
These module-joining costs are in addition to the cost of cement used in joining Module 1 to Mod­
ule 2. 

1.3.3  Total Cost 

The  total  cost  to  execute  your  design  may  be  estimated  by  summing  up  the  cost  of  deltas, 
cement, and module joinery, and multiplying the result by an overhead factor K: 

Total Cost = K x (delta cost + cement cost + module cost) 

Because K takes into account the cost of living on DeltaP and must be updated frequently, it is 
not included in this primer. Refer to the earlier handout entitled  “The  Design Task”  for its value, or 
ask the instructor. 

1.4  Estimating Time-to-Build 

Estimating time-to-build is inexact, at best, but again your contractor has supplied some rules 
of  thumb.  Rough  results  are  shown  in  the  graph,  but  you  will  do  better  to  ﬁgure 
them more  pre­
cisely. 

For each module consisting of three deltas or fewer, allow 2 wex;


For each module consisting of more than three deltas, allow 3 wex;


For each module-to-module joint, allow 4 wex;


Sum all of these up and double the result.
