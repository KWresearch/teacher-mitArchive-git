***** Course Description *****
In this sophomore design course, you will be challenged with three design
tasks: a first concerning water resources/treatment, a second concerning
structural design, and a third focusing on the conceptual (re)design of a large
system, Boston's Back Bay. The first two tasks require the design, fabrication
and testing of hardware. Several laboratory experiments will be carried out and
lectures will be presented to introduce students to the conceptual and
experimental basis for design in both domains.

This course was based in large part on the Fall 2005 offering of 1.101,
developed by Prof. Harold Hemond.
