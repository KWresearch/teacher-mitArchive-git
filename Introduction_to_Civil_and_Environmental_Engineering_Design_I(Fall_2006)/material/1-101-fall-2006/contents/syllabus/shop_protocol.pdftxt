CEE Shop Protocol 

This  document  is  specific  to  the  “Undergraduate  Instructional  Shop”.

The  information  given  here  is  in  addition  to  the  “Hand  and  Power  Tool  Safety”

guidelines.  Please read that document as well before working in the shop.


No  one  is  required  to  use  machinery,  power  tools,  or  hand  tools.   We  encourage  you  to 
learn but if you do not feel comfortable, ask a team member or instructor to help you or to 
do it for you. 

There  is  a  right  and  a wrong way  to  use  every  tool  or machine.   Using  it  the wrong way 
may result in: 
•	 Working inefficiently. 
•	 Causing harm to the tool or machine. 
•	 Causing personal injury to you or someone else. 

Procedures 

•	 The shop may only be used when it is opened and supervised by 

an instructor.

•	 Use of the shop outside of class hours must be prearranged. 
•	 Safety glasses are to be worn at all times in the shop even if no 

machines are running.

•	 Do not use any machine without first checking with an instructor, 

even if you know how to use it.

•	 Do not assume that once you have been shown how to use a par­

ticular machine you can now use it for other applications without 

checking with the instructor.  Different materials may require dif­

ferent speeds or cutting tools.

•	 Turn machines off as soon as you are finished.  Do not leave them 

running while you figure out your next cut.

•	 The miter saw is a very aggressive and dangerous tool.  It is only 

to be operated by the instructors.

•	 Tools must be returned to their storage areas as soon as you are

finished using them.

•	 Everyone is responsible for cleaning the machines and work area 

they use.
