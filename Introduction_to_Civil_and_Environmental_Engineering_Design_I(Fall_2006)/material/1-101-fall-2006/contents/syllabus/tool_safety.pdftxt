Hand and Power Tool Safety 

We  use  tools  frequently  in  everyday  life.    From  a  simple  pair  of  scissors  or  a  screwdriver  to  a  complex 
metal-working machine,  tools  make  our  work  easier.    But  no matter  how  simple,  a  tool  used  incorrectly 
can  cause  serious  bodily  harm.    It  is  important  to  think  before  using  any  tool  and  consider  the  potential 
hazards.  Make SAFETY a priority. 

There are two areas of concern when dealing with the proper use of tools – in this 
order: 
1) Personal Safety – no one gets injured. 
2) Tool Care – tools are not damaged. 

General Practices 
•	 Never work alone! 
•	 Before working in a lab, know where the phone, fire alarm and emer­

gency exit is.

•	 Use the right tool for the job. 
•	
If you don’t know what a tool is or how to use it, DON’T. 
•	
If you don’t know what tool to use for a task, ASK. 
•	 Return tools to their proper storage area when you are finished. 
•	 Do not use paint (spray or brushed) or anything that gives off fumes in a 

closed room, go to a room with proper ventilation or outside.

•	 Dispose of sharp or potentially sharp objects in a designated container; 

this includes knife blades, glass (broken or whole), needles, nails, etc.

•	 Do not put your hand behind anything you are working on with hand or

power tools.

•	 Nothing is a ladder except a ladder; make sure ladders are stable. 
•	 Be sure to keep good footing and maintain good balance. 

Personal Preparation 

•	 Hair – long hair should be tied back out of your way. 
•	
Jewelry – remove rings, chains and other jewelry. 
•	 Clothing – change loose or baggy clothing or make sure it is securely fas­

tened.

•	 Eyes – wear safety glasses at all times in a work area. 
•	 Ears – wear ear protection if in a noisy area. 
•	 Hands – wear leather gloves when handling rough wood and other materi­

als, do not wear gloves when operating power tools.

•	 Lungs – use a respirator if in a dusty area or if vapors are present. 
•	 Feet – do not wear sandals or open-toed shoes.

•	 Mind – do not use power tools when you are ill, taking strong 
medications, fatigued or consuming alcoholic drinks. 

Work Area 
•	 Lighting – make sure there is enough lighting to see what you are 
doing. 
•	 Footing – make sure the floor is not slippery; no water or dust. 
•	 Clamping – make sure your work piece is on a firm surface or 
securely clamped. 
•	 Space – keep the work area clear and uncrowded. 

Tools – do not leave tools lying on the floor. 

Hand Tools 

•	 Do not use a screwdriver or pliers on electrical equipment unless 
is it certified for electrical use. 
•	 Never use a screwdriver as a hammer, chisel or pry bar. 
•	 Use the correct hammer for the work being done. 
•	 Have an unobstructed swing when using a hammer (overhead 
clearance and other people). 
•	 When using a wrench, make sure it is the correct size. 
•	 Always pull on a wrench, if it slips you won’t crush your fingers. 
•	 Do not use wrenches or bars as extensions for hand tools. 
•	 When using a knife, cut away from your body keeping hands and 
body away from the knife stroke. 
•	 Make sure tools are sharp, dull tools can actually be more danger­
ous. 
•	 Cover sharp tools when not in use. 

Power Tools 

•	 Do not operate power tools in damp or wet locations without 
Ground Fault Circuit Interrupt (GFCI) protection (the type of out­
let found in kitchens and bathrooms). 
•	 Never carry a tool by the cord. 
•	 Never yank the cord to unplug it. 
•	 Make sure the cord is not in the cutting path. 
•	 Do not operate a power tool if the cord or tool is damaged.

•	 Unplug the tool before making any adjustments and when it is not 
being used. 
•	 Use two hands on a power tool whenever possible. 
•	 Place fingers so there is no danger they will slip into moving 

parts.

•	 Keep your finger off the trigger of a power tool when you aren’t 
actually using it. 
•	 Give your job your full attention, do not look away or talk to oth­
ers. 
•	 Never startle someone who is using a power tool. 
•	 Observers and helpers should stand back, use the proper protec­
tive gear and follow the instructions of the tool operator. 
•	 Parts that are being worked on can get very hot, be careful han­
dling them. 

Electrical Safety 

•	 Be sure power is off before working on electrical equipment or 
circuits. 
•	 Do not defeat grounding plugs on equipment. 
•	 Two-pronged plugs are usually polarized – it is dangerous to

reverse polarization.

•	 Only use an extension cord when necessary and make sure it is 
the proper size for the current draw of the equipment. 
•	 Do not use multiple power strips chained together. 

If you don’t feel comfortable using a tool, ask someone to do it for you!
