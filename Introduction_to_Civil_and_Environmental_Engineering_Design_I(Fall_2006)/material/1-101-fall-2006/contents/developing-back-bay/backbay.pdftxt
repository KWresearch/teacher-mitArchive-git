Developing Back Bay 
 
Pre-Handout 
 
Scope and Background 
 
This  is  your  third  project  and  substantially  different  from  the  first  two.    It  is 
actually  a  large  scale  planning  project  and  as  such,  it  is  open  ended.    Its 
complexity  requires  that  the  design  is  done  by  a  team  with  each  team  member 
concentrating  on  a  specialty.    You  should  follow  the  design  process  as  given  to 
you in the lectures. 
 
The  intent  of  this  project  is  to  have  you  define  the  constraints  (boundary 
conditions) as part of  the problem  formulation.    While  it may be unusual  to have 
such  a  “wide  open”  project,  it  is  a  good way  to  start with  any  planning  or  design 
project  to  assume  very  relaxed  boundary  conditions.    This  will  give  you  the 
freedom to come up with innovative solutions even when you add constraints. 
 
In  this  particular  exercise  you  will  not  only  have  the  opportunity  to  plan  and 
design  a  different  “Back  Bay”  but  you will  be  able  to  compare what was  actually 
done with what one (you!!) could have done. 
 
Imagine Boston in the topographical shape of the late 18th century! 
 
When the first settlers founded Boston, its topography looked much different from 
what it looks now.    At that time Boston was a pear-shaped peninsula, which was 
connected to the mainland only through a narrow neck.    (Figure 1). 
 
The  peninsula  was  bordered  by  large  tidal  flats  and  had many  inlets  and  coves.   
One  of  these,  North  Cove,  was  cut  off  by  a  mill  dam/causeway  already  in  1640 
(Figure  2).    On  a  small  scale,  the  shoreline  was  changed  more  or  less 
continuously  from  that  time  onwards.    However,  changes  on  a  larger  scale  did 
not occur until the beginning of the 19th century. 
 
Design Task 
 
You  are  charged  with  the  development  of  the  Back  Bay  area  based  on  the 
topography  as  it  existed  around  1800  (Figures  3,  4)  but  using  modern 
construction  technology  and  satisfying  present  day  requirements.    You  have  to 
create  a  mixed  residential-commercial  area  with  50,000  inhabitants.    You  are 
completely  free  in  your  choice  of  buildings,  access  (transportation),  utilities, 
providing foundations and so on.

The  result  of  your  work  should  be  in  form  of  a  rough  plan  indicating 
residential/commercial  zones,  major  streets  or  other  access. 
 
In  an 
accompanying  report  (max.  4  pages,  double-spaced)  you  should  explain  how 
your  design  satisfies  the  boundary  conditions  and  how  it  addresses  structural, 
aesthetic  and  environmental  concerns.    You  should  also  indicate  if  what  you 
propose will end up with medium or with high costs.    More specific comments on 
the deliverables are given on the next page. 
 
Very  important:    Do not assume  that what has been done,  i.e.  the present Back 
Bay, is the best solution! 
 
 
Topography 
 
 
The  topography of Boston you have  to work with  is as shown  in Figures 3 and 4.   
[For  your  information,  a  map  of  the  present  Back  Bay  with  the  late  18th  century 
shoreline is presented in Figure 5.]    1.    The Charles River was a tidal basin with 
the  tides  varying  between  el.  100.8  ft.  (mean  low  water  level)  and  el.  110.2  ft. 
(mean high water level). The highest reported tide occurred in 1851 with el. 116.6 
ft.    The  elevation  of  the  adjacent  land  is  approximately  117  feet.    (See  next 
section  for  explanation  of  elevations.)    As mentioned  above,  part  of  the Charles 
River  bottom  was  exposed  during  low  tide,  forming  so-called  tidal  flats.   
Conversely,  during  high  tides,  the  water  level  in  Boston  Harbor  may  be  such  to 
cause considerable backflow into the Charles River.    If this occurs in conjunction 
with  major  rainfall  and  large  flows  in  the  Charles  River,  the  shore  areas  can  be 
flooded. 
 
While you are completely free to plan “your Back Bay” in the Charles River Basin, 
you  should  not  include  the  original  peninsula  in  your  design,  except  for  the 
connections to your new Back Bay. 
 
Geology, Rules of Thumb for Foundations 
 
A typical soil profile of the present Back Bay is shown in Figure 6.    Note:    There 
was no  fill when  the original Back Bay was developed.    So you have  to decide  if 
you  want  to  fill  and  how  much.    One-story  buildings  can  be  placed  directly  on 
the  fill  without  basements,  3-5  story  buildings  can  be  placed  on  the  fill  with  a  1-
story  basement.    Higher  buildings  require  correspondingly  more  basements.   
High  rises  up  to  15  stories  can  be  put  on  piles  reaching  into  the  till;  higher 
buildings have to put on piles reaching the bedrock.    Clearly deeper foundations 
cause higher costs.

As  indicated  earlier,  you  should  work  with  the  most  modern  construction 
technology  and  materials.    If  you  want  to  fill  the  area  with  soil  before  building, 
you can either use gravel  from gravel pits  in  the Needham area or  from dredging 
in  the  Charles  River  next  to  Back  Bay.    (You  need  to  think  about  the 
consequences using these material resources, however.) 
 
Protection from High Tides 
 
One  of  the  options  you  may  consider  is  to  close  off  the  Charles  River  from 
Boston  Harbor  (as  it  is  done  now).    Keep  in  mind,  however,  that  what  you 
propose will have some environmental impacts, which you have to address. 
 
Several other cities have  installed  facilities  to protect  themselves  from high  tides.   
Here are some examples: 
 
London: Complete.    The  Thames  barriers  are  open  during  normal  operation  but 
closed during surge tides (see Figures 7 – 8). 
Venice:  Being built.    To protect the lagoon from high tides, a new barrier system 
is being built (see Figure 9). 

 
 
Environmental Issues 
 
You might replace some of  the  tidal basin with  fill.    This will have several effects 
that  you  need  to  consider:    Less  available  volume  for  tidal  inflow,  less  available 
volume  for  rainwater  accumulation  (both  locally  and  from  upstream).    Also, 
buildings,  streets,  etc.  will  have  an  effect  on  the  groundwater  and  vice  versa.   
Your  design  should  minimize  negative  environmental  effects  or,  even  better, 
have positive effects.     
 
 
Cost 
 
No  detailed  cost  calculations  are  required.    You  have  to  estimate,  however,  if 
your  scheme  will  involve  medium  or  high  costs.    You  have  to  provide  some 
arguments of how you get your estimates. 
 
Deliverables 
 
•  Land use plan with transportation network, building type both re. use and 
height , and other land usage.    (You can use something like Figure 10 as a 
framework for your plan.)    This is part of the report below.
