Structures - Experiment 3A 
1.101 Sophomore Design - Fall 2006 
The Tension Test. 
Our objective is to measure the Elastic Modulus of steel. 

You will subject a steel rod speciman to a tension test using an Instron testing machine designed 
specifically for that purpose.  An "extensometer" will be used to obtain a measure of strain and a 
"load cell" used to obtain a measure of stress. 

You will use the pages that follow in reporting your results.   This then is your report. 
 

2.1 Tension Test of a steel rod. 

The INSTRON machine is built specifically to sub-
ject structural elements to tension or compression. 
The schematic at the right indicates how it works. 

A double acting piston drives the table up, or 
down, when pressurized hydraulically. The test 
specimen is fixed relative to the top bar and the 
shaded cross bar by the grips; the shaded cross bar 
is fixed in space. Hence, the specimen is subject to 
a tensile load as the table moves downward.

Parameters for determining tensile stress. 

The load is sensed by a load cell at the top bar. It puts out a voltage proportional to the load. For 
our purposes, all you need know is the scaling factor for converting the voltage to tensile force.  
This is obtained from a "full scale" setting, the "automatic calibration" of the load cell.  At full 
scale, the signal output is_____ Volts; the corresponding load is ____KN or ___________ Kips1. 

The load factor is then:    

  Load factor = 

  KN/volt

Knowing the cross-sectional area of the test specimen, we can, knowing the load, compute the ten-
sile stress in the bar. We record that the diameter of the specimen as: 
mm 

Diameter = 

So the cross sectional area is 

Area  =

mm2 

The bar, made of ___________steel, has a  (ask) 
  yield stress of   ______   Mpa   and  an ultimate stress of   ________  MPa

For our specimen then, we expect large deformations at a load of 
Expected yield  ~  _________________ KN 

This suggests that our output voltage will range from zero  to above 
  volts. 

Anticipated load voltage at yield  = 

Our goal is to graph how the tensile stress varies with the tensile strain.  We need, then to go one 
step further and construct the factor for tensile stress in terms of voltage.  Dividing the force by the 
area we obtain2: 

Stress factor = 

MPa/volt 

To compute the corresponding values of the strain, we need to measure the change in length of the 
specimen.  The strain is then the ratio of the change in length to the original length.

Parameters for determining tensile strain. 

An extensometer will be used to measure the change in length between two points located on the 
surface of the cylindrical specimen.  The two knife edges, which are held in place against the spec-
imen by simple elastic bands,  are initially spaced a preset distance apart.  This "gage length" is 

Gage Length  = 

mm 

The gage factor is determined from "full scale" conditions.  The extensonmeter we will use can 
accomodate a full scale displacement of +/- ____ mm. Full scale output voltage is _______volts. 
Hence, the scale factor for displacement is 

Displacement factor  =

mm/volt 

The strain factor is then, dividing by the gage length 

Strain  factor  =

 mm/mm/volt   

Data Collection and Analysis 

Data will be recorded via the computer (equipped with analogue to digital conversion hardware).  
An ASCI text file will be produced in three column format. The first dozen or so readings will 
show negative values for the displacement and load as the speciman "takes up the load".

Process your raw data as we did the first class of the semester, using a spread sheet. You will be 
able to download the text data file from our Stellar site almost immediately. 

Results 
Once we have a plot, we determine the slope in the elastic range.  This slope, if taken directly from 
the graph, will have the units of volts/volts. We follow the trail back through all the scale factors to 
compute the slope as a ratio of tensile stress to tensile strain. We obtain in this way the following 
experimentally determined value for E, the elastic, or Young’s modulus: 
+/- ? psi or 

E, the elastic, or Young’s modulus  = 

+/-?  Pascals 

Ebook value = 30 x 106 psi = 207x109 Pa 

Import the graph from your spread sheet or simply, physically cut and paste it into this document 
on the next page.
