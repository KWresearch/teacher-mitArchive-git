What does all this have to do with the picture shown? 

Here, Mo is the applied moment at the end of the beam.  
Within the beam, 0<x<L, the bending moment is con-
stant and equal to the applied moment. It is positive 
according to our convention.

 Engineering Beam Theory 

Engineering beam theory shows that the most 
significant stress is the normal stress compo-
nent on an “x face”; σx  in the example at the 
right. It is related to the applied loads by 

M y
⋅ z 
=  --------------
I 

σ x 

where z is the distance from the “neutral 
axis” which, for a doubly symmetric beam, is 
at the center of the cross-section and I is the 
moment of inertia of the cross section. 

I  =  ∫ z 2 dA 
A 

For a rectangular cross-section of width b 
and height h, this is  I = bh3/12 

The applied loads come in through the bend-
ing moment My. The convention for positive 
shear and bending moment is shown in the 
figure.

The extensional strain, from the stress/strain 
relations is just  ε x  =  σ x  ⁄ E  where E is the Elastic Modulus. In terms of the geometry of 
deformation, the extensional strain is given by ε x  =  z R    where R is the radius of curvature of 
⁄ 
the neutral axis. (1/R) is the curvature. The “bending stiffness” is defined as the product E I as it
