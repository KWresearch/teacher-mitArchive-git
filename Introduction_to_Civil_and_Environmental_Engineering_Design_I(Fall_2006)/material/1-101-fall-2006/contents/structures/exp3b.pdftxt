Linear elastic behavior of a beam. 
The objectives of this experiment are to experimentally study the linear elastic behavior of beams 
under four point bending - in particular. 
•	 To compare the stiffness of the beam with the results of engineering beam theory. 
•	 To measure the extensional strain in the top and bottom fibers of the beam  and com-
pare the strain/stress with the prediction of engineering beam theory. 
The beam specimen, made of Aluminum and 24 inches long, will be simply supported near its ends 
and loaded at two points symmetrically disposed with respect to midspan, This “four point bend-
ing” produces “pure bending” (no shear) over the midspan section.  Two strain gages are mounted 
on the top and on the bottom near midspan, within the range of pure bending. A dial gage, at center 
span, is employed to measure deflection.  The beam will be loaded using dead weights. You will 
compare bending strain/stress and beam stiffness obtained experimentally to engineering beam 
theory predictions.

and the bending moment of inertia, the second moment of area about an axis into/out of the paper, 
are (See Appendix on beam bending). 

IIbeam  =  _____________in4 

Now mark off two points, three inches to the left and right of the no-lead end of the strain gages. 
Mark both the top and bottom flanges of the beam at these load points. The three inches need not 
be “exact” but the two load points should be symmetrically disposed with respect to the point you 
choose as center of the beam. This center point should not lie atop a strain gage but an eighth of an 
inch or so off the gage. 

Position the dial gage probe on center, midway between the two load points without resting on the 
strain gage but as close as possible to the end of the gage away from the leads. Now adjust the end 
supports so that  this point is truly midspan. 

Loop the thin cables with eye hook ends over the beam at the two symmetrically disposed loading 
points, three inches off center. Connect the cables to the horizontal bar below the test bed with s 
hooks.  Add the empty bucket. Let this be your “no load” condition. (Our interest is in the linear, 
behavior of the beam so what we designate as “no load” condition is arbitrary - within limits).

With the power supply disconnected from the circuit board, set the +20v supply to +10v and ver-
ify that the - 20v supply is set to -10v (with the full tracking nob turned all the way clockwise). 
Turn off the power supply. 

Connect the +10v  and the -10v supply leads to terminal block H2 as indicated in the figure.  Make 
sure the positive goes to the positive terminal. Connect the common to the terminal block H1 at the 
terminal marked “gnd”,  also as indicated in the figure. 

After having an instructor check your connections, turn on the power supply and, with the Digi-
tal Multimeter, check the voltages at the strain gage input terminals nodes a, b, c and d on the ter-
minal blocks G1, G2, G3, and G4.  One should read +10v, node c, two others approximately +5v, 
nodes a and b, and the fourth should read ~0v, (ground) node d. 

Now connect the leads of the voltmeter to measure the voltage difference of e1 and e2.  You should 
see two bare wires sticking up from about the middle of the circuit board. (See diagram, last page). 
The polarity - which lead you attach to which wire - doesn’t matter.

You should see some positive or negative voltage difference, different from zero - indicating that 
the bridge is “unbalanced”.  Adjust the 2 Kohm potentiometer setting using the small screwdriver. 
If you can not bring the difference of e1 and e2 to zero, see your instructor. 

Now attach the 2nd voltmeter  to measure the output of the op-amp, i.e., to the terminal block H1. 
This voltage will probably be different from zero. Proceed as follows. 

Measuring the op-amp Gain. 

Reset the bridge balancing pot, the 2Kohm pot, so that the output of the bridge (which is the input 
to the amplifier) is on the order of 10 mv, then measure the output of the amplifier to obtain the 
gain.  

Repeat this for a op-amp input, the difference of e1 and e2, of approximately 20mv. Repeat for op-
amp inputs of the same magnitude but of opposite sign. Record all of this data, 4, or 5 points, in the 
table and fit a straight line. The slope of this line is the amplification, the Gain.

The bending test. 

Press down lightly on the beam to verify setup. Op amp output should be on the order of 10 mv. 

Now load the beam in increments of 6 pounds (the “big” weights), placing the weights carefully 
into the bucket. Do not exceed 48 pounds.  Take data during unloading as well.

 Column 1 is the applied load in pounds. Column 2 is the measured op-amp output in volts or mil-
livots; the latter the preferred units. Column 3 is the dial gage reading.  Note. The gage will run 
“backwards” if located on top of the beam.  Make sure you develop a good sense of what the read-
ings mean, how you will use them to deduce the vertical displacement before you start the test. But 
record the reading shown by the gage at each load value. 

Columns 4 and 5 are computed from your input values.  (If you measured displacement from zero, 
column 4 will be the same as column 3). The stress at the top of the beam is compressive, that at 
the bottom, tensile and they are equal for a doubly symmetric cross-section as we have here, 
according to engineering beam theory. Both values are computed from the product of the strains at 
top and bottom - also equal - and the elastic modulus, E. See the appendix on the strain gage bridge 
to see how to compute strain value from the op-amp output.

Make a plot showing how the load (ordinate axis) varies with displacement (abscissa). Fit a 
straight line through the points (by eye will suffice). What is the “stiffness” of the beam (for this 
loading condition and geometry) - the slope of the line. On this same plot, show the result from 
engineering beam theory, using the analysis in the appendix.

Appendix 1:  Engineering Beam Theory 
Engineering beam theory shows that the most 
significant stress is the normal stress compo-
nent on an “x face”; σx  in the example at the 
right. It is related to the applied loads by 

M y  ⋅ z 
σ x  =  --------------
I 

where z is the distance from the “neutral 
axis” which, for a doubly symmetric beam, is 
at the center of the cross-section and I is the 
moment of inertia of the cross section. 

I  =  ∫ z 2 dA 
A 

For a rectangular cross-section of width b 
and height h, this is  I = bh3/12 

The applied loads come in through the bend-
ing moment My. The convention for positive 
shear and bending moment is shown in the 
figure.

The extensional strain, from the stress/strain 
relations is just  ε x  =  σ x  ⁄ E  where E is the Elastic Modulus. In terms of the geometry of 
deformation, the extensional strain is given by ε x  =  z R    where R is the radius of curvature of

Appendix 2.  Strain-gage Circuit. 
The bridge circuit produces an output voltage, |e1 -e2| 
proportional to the change in resistance of the active 
strain gages. This voltage signal, in turn, is input to an 
operational amplifier which boosts the (dc) signal by 
the Gain factor, G. 

The two strain gages fixed tothe specimen subject to 
loading are positioned in the bridge circuit on the right. 
A positive change in resistance of a gage indicates ten-
sion, negative indicates compression. Note: It does 
not matter if you switch the location of the two 
active gages in the bridge circuit. This will simply 
change the polarity of the voltage difference e1 - e2 . 

The gages on the passive beam, the one not loaded, 
provide a measure of temperature compensation.

It can be shown (and I probably will) that the output of the bridge is related to the small change in 
resistance, ∆R/Rg by:

 [1] 

e1 - e2 = (Vsupply /2)(∆R/Rg)  where Vsupply  is 10 volts.

 The strain as a function of change in resistance is given by

 [2] 

 
ε  =  (1/Fgage)(∆R/Rg) 

where Fgage  is the "gage factor" stated by the manufacturer1  to be

 Fgage  =2.07 +/- 0.5% 

With these, you can compute the strain in the member, given the voltage difference e1-e2. 

I.E., The voltage difference e1 - e2 is obtained from your measured values at the op-amp output by 
dividing by the amplifier gain.  


Then you compute  (∆R/Rg) from [1].


Then compute  ε, the strain, from [2].


The stress is obtained from the linear stress/strain relationship:  σ = E ε
