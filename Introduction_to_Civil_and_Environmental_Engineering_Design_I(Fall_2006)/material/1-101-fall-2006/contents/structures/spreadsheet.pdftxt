Spreadsheet Example 
1.101  Fall 2006 

In a structures lab scheduled for the third week in October, we will subject a specimen in the form of 
a steel rod to tension using an Instron testing machine designed specifically for that purpose. The 
figure below shows the Instron machine and the approximate shape of the steel specimen.

Our objective will be to observe how the specimen extends as the tensile load is gradually 
increased - until, ultimately, the steel breaks. An “extensonmeter” will be used to obtain a measure 
of extension and a “load cell” used to obtain a measure of the applied tensile force. The output of 
both of these transducers will be a voltage. 

Today, at this session, we will take a sample of data taken last fall and convert these values in our 
spreadsheet to values of strain and stress. We will use the spreadsheet first to plot the raw data - 
load voltage versus extension voltage - then to plot stress versus strain. Our purpose is not to 
explain how a tension test is conducted nor even to discuss the results of that test in any great 
detail. You will have the opportunity to learn all about these matters the third week of October. 
Rather our aim is to give you the opportunity to work with the spreadsheet processing and plotting 
of test data. But note that what we do today as a spreadsheet exercise will serve as a template for 
data reduction, analysis and plotting when you do conduct the test in October. 

Most of you, I imagine, are familiar with and have used Microsoft’s spreadsheet. We will use “Xess”, 
which is available on Athena. Most all of the important points I want to make today carry over 
directly to Microsoft Works. 

To launch Xess: 

athena% add xess 

athena% xess & 

We import our 05 data file: 

Xess menu: File>Import 

Filter Window: File Format>Tab Separated Values 

Files > tensile.tsv [Note: This is available at Stellar 1.101>Materials>General] 

OK 

We carry on via overhead display.
