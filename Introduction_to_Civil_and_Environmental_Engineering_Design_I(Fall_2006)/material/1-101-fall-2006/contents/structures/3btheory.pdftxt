1.101 Sophomore Design - Fall 2006 
The objective of the experiment is to compare engineering beam theory with experiment.  In par-
ticular, we want to compare what theory says about mid span deflection and the normal stress due 
to bending and what experiment tells you. 

The theory is summarized in the section appropriately titled Engineering Beam Theory. There 
you find an equation for the mid-span displacement, namely     

w 

m i d s p a n  

⎛  P a   ⎞ 
=  –  ------------
⎝ 24E I⎠ 

⋅ ( 3 L 2 – 4 a  )
2 

You have measured the lengths, L and a, and the applied load P.  NOTE THAT P IS ONE HALF 
THE WEIGHT IN THE BUCKET.  E is the elastic modulus of Aluminum, which if you have not 
already looked it up, is 

E = 10 x 106 psi.

 (one third of the value for steel). 

I is the moment of inertia of the cross-section. I refer you to the second page in Appendix 1. 

You need only compute one value for the mid-span displacement, (w, P) one point to plot on your 
graph of Load P versus displacement, since the variation of w with P (or P with w) is linear.  Draw 
the line and compare the slope you obtain with that obtained from plotting the experimental points 
and fitting a straight line through the latter.  This slope is the “siffness”, K,  at midspan, i.e., 

P= K w|midspan   So compare the two slopes. 

In this same Appendix 1, you will find an expression for the 
distribution of the normal stress due to bending over the 
cross-section, namely 

M ⋅ zy 
σ x  =  --------------
I 

You measured the strain in the top and bottom fibers of the 
beam. The top fiber is in compression, the bottom, in ten-
sion. So take the z in the above to be  z = h/2. 

z 

“top fiber” 

h

compression 
x
tension 
σx ,  εx

“bottom fiber”

The I you have already computed. The My is the bending moment at the point along the beam 
where the gages are located. (Or any point within the load points since the section is in pure bend-
ing). You express this in terms of P and a as we did in lab. Evaluate this at maximum load P. 

The experimental values for stress and strain are obtained by following the steps stated in Appen-
dix 2. Strain-gage circuit.  You can plot these values at each load to see if the variation is linear but 
you need only compare theory and experiment at the maximum loading condition.
