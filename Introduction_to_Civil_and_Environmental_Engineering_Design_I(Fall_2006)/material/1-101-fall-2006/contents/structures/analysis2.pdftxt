Recall that this was obtained from an engineering beam theory analysis of the deflection of the 
beam. Insisting that the slope of the beam is zero at x = L gave us the following relationship 
between the “applied” force F and the end moment Mo, namely 

Mo, = F(L/2) 

We use this later in figuring the bending stresses acting at the left end of the beam. 

∆, the transverse displacement at the end, can be expressed in terms of the angle of rotation of the 
top plate as ∆ = Rθ  so 

F  =  KB  ⋅ R θ 

The torque required to rotate the top plate about its central axis for the case when there are n iden-
tical shafts, under bending (but no torsion) is then: 

T  =  nKB  ⋅ R2 θ

•	  If we do anything to destroy the rotational symmetry, all bets are off. In particular if we slit 
a hollow tube lengthwise we dramatically decrease the torsional stiffness of the tube. 
For the design task, with “n” shafts, we have 

T  =  nKT  ⋅ θ 

where

KT  =  (G J ) ⁄ L 
 

For combined bending and torsion, we have, superimposing the two resistances to rotation:

Structure Stiffness 

In class, we let  KT  =  λ ⋅ KBR 2  where if λ =1, torsion and bending of the shafts contribute 
equally to the overall stiffness.  Expressing the K’s in terms of the physical properties and geome-

With this, we figured the torque T in terms of θ to be for λ = 1:

We put this stiffness in terms of L, rather than R, if you like, using the above, and obtain

1.  Note: The prior edition of this handout had an error in this relationship; the lambda was missing (it only applied 
for λ =1).  Note in this “corrected” edition, the second form was still in error. Again it was missing a lambda in the 
denominator. So this, hopefully final, revision has corrected that mistake.

Stress considerations 

Due to Bending 
The normal stress due to bending varies lin-
early over the cross section, reaching a maxi-
mum value at a distance r from the axis of 
the shaft. It is related to the bending moment

σ =  -------
I 
distribution is shown in the figure. The maxi-
mum bending moment occurs at the ends of 
the shaft

(or at the bottom of  the beam, at the other end).

Due to Torsion 
If the shafts are fixed at their ends to the top 
plate, then the shaft rotates about its axis the 
same amount as the whole structure (assuming 
small displacements and rotations so the tor-
sion doesn’t “couple” with the bending). The 
shear stress distribution does not vary along 
the shaft but does vary (linearly) over the cross 
section, reaching a maximum at the outer 
radius, e.g., at point A. From prior notes on tor-
sion:

you can verify by eliminating L2 from the first form.

paper must all vanish because the surface of the shaft is “stress free”.  (This means also that the 
“transverse shear stress due to bending” which is represented by the component σ13, must also 
vanish at point A).

Mohr’s Circle 
We are concerned with the possibility of the onset of plastic flow, of yielding. We apply the Tresca 
criteria which states that yielding will occur at a point in our material when the maximum shear 
stress at that point reaches the value of the maximum shear stress in a uniaxial tensile test. This is 
just one-half the yield stress observed in the tension test.(Top figure below). 

Tresca criteria for onset of plastic flow:
 τmax = σyield/2 
Mohr’s circle is a graphical representation, 
NOT OF THE CROSS SECTION OF THE 
SHAFT OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT 
COULD BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE 
MATERIAL SUBSTANCE, but of the math-
ematical relationships describing the way 
the components of a (two-dimensional) state 
of stress at a point change as you change 
your reference system at the point. Each 
point along the circumference of the circle 
gives the values of the normal and shear 
stress components acting at a different orien-
tation of our reference system. 

We are interested in finding the maximum 
value for the shear stress component - so we 
can apply the Tresca criteria. That point is at 
the top (or at the bottom of the circle) Its 
value equals the radius of the circle: 

i.e.  τmax  =  Rm o h r   =

Mohr’s circle also depicts how much you 
must rotate your reference system to get to 
the plane whereupon the shear stress attains 
this value. It also shows how much you must 
rotate your reference system to get to the 
plane(s) of maximum normal stress, the 
“principle” components of stress at the 
point, σI and σII.
