Where to start?....
                      What’s given?....  What info. do I need? 
What’s  do I want to get out, to “size”? 

Start: read the “requirements” 
•	
pH of the water delivered at the tap is to be 7 or higher. 
•	 Decrease in flow rate at the tap (or shower head) is to be tolerable, if not go 
unnoticed. 
•	 Pressure drop is not to exceed 15% of the supply pressure. 
•	 System should not leak 
•	 Space needs should not be excessive

Deduce, construct a list of “specifications” 
•	
pH of the water delivered at the tap is to be 7 or higher. 
What is the pH of the water at the source?  Test protocol says pH = 5. (See Prof. Gsch-
wend’s lecture also). 
•	 Decrease in flow rate at the tap (or shower head) is to be tolerable, if not go 

unnoticed.

What does this mean?  What is a household flow rate? Estimate (guess), measure, look up. 
•	 Pressure drop is not to exceed 15% of the supply pressure. 
What is an ordinary supply pressure? How high is Payson Park holding resevoir relative to 
Cambridge? Look up. Note that test protocol specifies 40-60 psi. 

Design parameters: 

Q: the flow rate <L3/T>  Specified - a user requirement, a “given” 
Tr: residence time <T> Crudely Specified - a system requirement 
n: material porosity 
Specified - a material(s) property. 
K: 	 conductivity <L/T>  Specified - a material(s) property. 
 
A: 	 pipe xsect. area  <L2>  To be determined, chosen. 
 
L: 	 pipe length  <L>  To be determined, chosen. 
 
D: pipe diam <L> To be determined, Note: Choose from 4 options 
h: total “head” <L>  ∆h is specified to be less than some number.
 a user requirement. 
z: height of in, out. <L>  To be determined, chosen. 
ρg: weight density of water <M/(L2T2)>  A given value. 
p: water pressure <M/(LT2)  Given at inlet.

“Sizing” the system. 
A popular method:


Choose a material, e.g., C33.  This sets the porosity, n, and residence time (roughly) Tr

  

nAL
With a flow rate, Q, specified, from  Q  =  -----------  find the volume of pipe required = AL
TR 

Choose a diameter, D, one of 4 discrete options. 

Determine A, then form above, the required length L. 

If L> 1000 meters, check for errors (units?, calculations?).  


If L> what you think is reasonable but not outlandish, try another material, or try a 

smaller residence time. (Remember, only crudely specified). Or try a bigger pipe area (if 

available).


Not finished; need to make sure pressure drop is below 15% of source pressure.


From 

Q  =  KA

⋅ ------∆ h -
 
L 

determine ∆h the system will experience.


If too big, check for errors, etc.


If ok, check cost.  Any other options?  


A more “complete” method. 

From 

Q  =  KA

⋅ ∆------h -
 
L

“solve” for L. 

L  =  KA

⋅ ∆------h -
 
Q 

Now specifiy our user friendly flow rate as some minimum value, Qmin 

So we want Q > Qmin  and at the extreme situation when ∆h is at maximum tolerable 
value (15% of supply pressure) ∆hmax 

This two settings and Darcy’s equation give  an upper bound on the length L
