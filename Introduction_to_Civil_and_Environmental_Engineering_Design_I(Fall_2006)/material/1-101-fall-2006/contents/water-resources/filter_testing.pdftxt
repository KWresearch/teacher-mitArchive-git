Water Filter Testing Protocol 
1.101 Fall 2006 
Water filters will be tested at three different flow rates.  Below are the steps you will be using to 
test, broken into two parts: connection and testing. 

Connection 

1. Connect the filter to the inlet and outlet connections provided at the water source, 
making sure that all connections are tight. 
2. Make sure the outlet valve is turned off and then open the inlet valve. 
3. Open the outlet valve slowly to allow the air out of the system.  It may be best to orient 
the filter so the outlet is at the top during air purging.  Make sure someone holds on to 
the outlet hose as outlet hoses under pressure can whip around causing a mess and 
injury. 
4. Once the air has been purged from the system, orient the filter as per your design.  
5. You will want to start the test with the system at full pressure, so run the water until 
the pump turns on, then close the outlet valve and wait for the pump to shut off. 

Testing 

1. Mechanical pressure gages may have a small discrepancy so you will want to check 
the readings of both the inlet gage and outlet gage while the system is equalized.  The 
pressure of the system should be around 50 psi.  Record the reading of each gage and 
note the difference if any. 
2. Due to the fact that the stationary water in the filter will be neutralized, you will need 
to run the water for at least two volume changes.  Open the outlet valve until the flow 
meter reads 3 gal/min and let run for at least two volume changes.  Record the inlet and 
outlet pressure.  Fill the first beaker with the filtered water. 
3. Close the outlet valve until the flow meter reads 2 gal/min and let run for at least two 
volume changes. Record the inlet and outlet pressure.  Fill the second beaker with the 
filtered water. 
4. Close the outlet valve until the flow meter reads 1 gal/min and let run for at least two 
volume changes. Record the inlet and outlet pressure.  Fill the third beaker with the fil-
tered water. 
5. Close the inlet valve and let the water drain from the filter. 
6. Disconnect the filter from the system. 
7. Run some water from the auxiliary tap and fill the fourth beaker with water. 
8. Measure the pH of the three flow rate samples and the supply and record the readings.

If there is a difference between the inlet pressure and outlet pressure in the no flow 
condition, the flow pressure drops should be adjusted accordingly.
