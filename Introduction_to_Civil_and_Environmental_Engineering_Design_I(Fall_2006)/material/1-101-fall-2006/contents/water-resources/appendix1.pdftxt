 Appendix 1: The Glass Electrode


The key component of our pH sensor system is the Glass Elec-
trode, shown in a schematic lifted from the article authored by 
Petr Vanysek posted on our Stellar site - an article worth read-
ing. The glass bulb, approximately 0.1mm thick, contains a 
solution of hydrochloric acid with constant concentration of 
chlorine ions. Because it is sealed, the pH inside the bulb is 
constant. 

When the glass membrane, the bulb, is immersed in water an 
ion exchange of “hydronium” (H+) between the solid, amor-
phous silicon dioxide membrane, and the surrounding solution 
produces a potential difference across the glass membrane/ 
solution interface. Theory says that this potential difference is 
directly proportional to “the activity of hydronium, a(H3O+)” 
and is given by:

where R is the gas constant, T the solution temperature in degrees kelvin, and F is Faraday’s con-
stant. (2.303 is a factor accounting for a conversion from natural to common logarithms. i.e. 
e2.303=10). “a(H3O+)...the activity of hydronium... at lower concentrations (can be) equated with 
its (aqueous) concentration” which we will write as [H+]. At room temperatures, the leading factor

The output of the device depends on an overall potential 
difference. The latter is that between the AgCl electrode 
in contact with the internal solution, (electrode 1 in the 
figure), and a second reference electrode, (electrode 2) 
immersed in the solution whose pH we seek to measure. 
(In our device, the reference electrode is positioned 
within a collar surrounding the sealed electrode).   

In addition to Einterface - the difference generated at the 
interface of the external surface of the membrane with 
the solution - other potential differences exist around 
this circuit. For example, there is a (constant) contribu-

tion to the output due to the (constant) potential difference at the interface of the internal HCl solu-
tion and the membrane. Other potential differences exist but, because they are all constant (we 
presume), changes in output of the device is due only to changes in the concentration of hydro-
nium. These other constant voltage differences only contribute a constant “offset” to our measured 
output. We write: 

V  =  V o  + 0.059 ⋅ log [H+ ] 

The pH is defined as the negative of the common logarithm of the concentration of hyrdronium in 
solution, that  is 

so we have 

pH ≡ – log [H+ ] 

V  = – ( s l o p e ) ⋅ pH  + V o f f s e t  

where, in theory, the slope should be approximately 0.059. But we will obtain a value from our cal-
ibration procedure.
