Ten second, two point line fit, time axis intercept 

This is a crude measure of neutralization time. 
It’s advantage is that it standardizes your 
measurements enabling a comparsion across 
groups. 

In your design, you must decide upon a 
residence time which will be, no doubt, of 
longer duration. Just how long depends upon 
how “conservative” you choose to be.
