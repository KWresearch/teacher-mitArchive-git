Water Resources Design Task 
1.101   Fall 2006 

Background 
In certain regions, well water tends to be acidic. In eastern Massachusetts, for example, the pH of 
precipitation can be as low as 4 or even lower, and in the absence of enough neutralization by soils 
the resulting groundwater will also be acidic. It is also possible for local geologic conditions to 
contribute acidity to groundwater, as when organic acids are produced in wetlands. 

One result is that water drawn from wells and springs can be acidic enough to dissolve metals from 
distribution pipes. If the distribution pipes are of lead, or-as is much more common nowadays-are 
of copper with connections soldered together with solder containing lead, significant amounts of 
lead can be dissolved into the drinking water that passes through the pipes. Although quantitative 
measures of the dissolution of lead require chemical analysis of the water, evidence for the corro-
sion of piping may be revealed by the presence of blue-green stains on plumbing fixtures beneath 
water taps or shower heads. The color is due to copper in the water; where copper is being dis-
solved, it is a good bet that lead from lead-based solder is also. [See MWRA, A Report on What’s 
New about your Drinking Water, p. 5, Stellar posted as MWRA Annual Report 05]. 

One way to limit the dissolution of metals from the piping is to eliminate the metals from the pip-
ing system. In fact, in Massachusetts it is now required that copper pipes in new houses be sol-
dered with lead-free solder. This, however, is of no help to the vast majority of older homes that 
have lead-based solder. In these cases, raising the pH of the water to make it less corrosive can be 
a way to mitigate the problem. 

Design Task 
Your job is to design, fabricate, assemble and test a system, (a column) that neutralizes the acidity 
and hence much of the corrosivity of water in a residential water system. Market surveys reveal 
that residents notice the effects of acidity when their water source has a pH of 5 or less. These 
same surveys also show that family size clusters in the range 3 to 5 and the typical residence is a 
single family, three bedroom, two bath unit. Your boss has set out the following requirements. 

Requirements 
•	
pH of the water delivered at the tap is to be 7 or higher. 
•	 Decrease in flow rate at the tap (or shower head) is to be tolera-

ble, if not go unnoticed.

Pressure drop is not to exceed 15% of the supply pressure. 
System should not leak 
Space needs should not be excessive.

Other Considerations 
•	 Cost 
•	
Service & Maintenance - Time to recharge. 
•	 Transient Conditions 

Resources 
A listing of available component resources - pipes, valves, couplings, pressure gages, and the like 
- will be provided in lab. Ground calcium carbonate of three partical size distributions will be pro-
vided. 

Test Plan 
Your system will be tested to prove its worth. Water, with a pH approximately equal to 5 and at a 
pressure in the range 40 to 60 psi, will be provided as a supply. The figures on the next page show 
the interface geometry. 

You will measure the following variables in steady flow conditions: 
•	
the pressure drop in psi 
•	
the flow rate in gallons/minute 
•	
the pH delivered 
Further details of the recommended test procedure will be provided as needed. 

Report 
Your effort is a group effort. But each individual is responsible for documenting their contribution 
in their lab notebook. Your are to produce a single, group report. It’s contents should include: 
•	
Summary of design task as given with requirements. 
•	 A drawing of suitable detail such that one responsible for fabrica
-
tion of parts - e.g., someone familiar with your work like Stephen 

Rudolph - could do so without coming to you with too many

questions.

•	 A parts list - including specification of porous material. 
•	
Performance measures - pressure drop, flow rate, pH delivered. 
•	 Reflections on design process & on your product. 
•	 An Appendix with an analysis justifying your choice of design

parameters built upon the results of your experimental determina
-
tion of residence time and flow conductivity.(NOTE: THIS  

APPENDIX IS TO BE PREPARED FOR DISTRIBUTION AT

YOUR FIRST DESIGN REVIEW).
