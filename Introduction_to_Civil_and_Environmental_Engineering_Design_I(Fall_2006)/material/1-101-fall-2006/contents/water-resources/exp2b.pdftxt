Estimation of Hydraulic Conductivity and Porosity. 

In lecture we developed the following ideas and equations to describe the storage and flux 
of water in a porous (granular) media. 

Porosity: The porosity, n, is the fraction of volume occupied by pore spaces. Only the 
pore spaces are available to hold or pass water.   For total volume, V, and pore volume, VP, 
 
n = VP / V. 
(1) 
Darcy’s Law: Flow in a porous medium is driven by gradients in hydraulic head, 

(2) 

h = z + p/ρg. 

Here z indicates elevation above a 
specified datum, p is the pressure, ρ is 
the density of the fluid (for water at 69 
deg. F, ρ = 0.998 grams/cubic 
centimeter) and g is the gravitational 
constant. The volumetric flow rate, Q, is 
then given by Darcy’s law, 

(3) 

Q  =  K A

where A is the cross-sectional area of the 
flow domain and K is the hydraulic 
 
conductivity.  In the system shown the 
hydraulic gradient is ∆h/∆x = (h3-h4)/L, 
so that the volumetric flow through the 
column is Qout = KA (h3-h4)/L.

The hydraulic conductivity will vary with grain size, d, and porosity, as well as with the 
fluid viscosity, µ. The Kozeny-Carmen Equation captures these dependencies,

Laboratory Tasks: Determine the Porosity and Hydraulic Conductivity for each 
Material 

Repeat the following procedure for each of the three test materials, and report the porosity 
and hydraulic conductivity, with uncertainty, for each material. 

You will have a re-usable test column made from a short piece of tubing, with cross-
section A.   Fill the column with one of the grain types and set it vertically in the ring-stand 
provided, as shown in the figure below. Place a mesh at the top of the column. To record 
the length of sediment, L, remember that some of the sediment column is hidden behind 
the end cap.

Porosity: 
The first task is to fill the column with water and eliminate trapped air. To do this you 
must fill the column from the bottom, by connecting the hose and funnel as shown above.   
Before you begin filling, mark two positions on the column with rubber bands at 
approximately 1/3 L and 2/3 L, as shown above. When you begin filling water through the 
funnel, watch the wetted front climb up the column. Stop when the front reaches rubber 
band 1. As you continue to add water, carefully note the volume of water added, Vw, to 
raise the wetted front to band 2. The volume of water added between rubber bands 1 and 2 
fills the pores in this region, i.e. VP=Vw. The total volume of this region is V = AL1. Now 
you can calculate the porosity of this material using equation (1).

Hydraulic Conductivity: 

Move the rubber bands to a position about 4 inches above the top of the sediment. This 
position  is  the  target  for  the  water  level.  Continue  filling  the  column  from  below  until 
water  reaches  the  rubber  bands.  Then,  close  the  valve  at  the  base  of  column.  Using  a 
bucket  to  catch  the  water,  carefully  remove  the  funnel  and  hose  from  the  base  of  the 
column. Place a beaker beneath the column. 
Now chose the group member with the greatest eye-hand coordination to be the water 
level monitor  (WLM).  This  person will  be  responsible  to maintain  the water  level  at  the 
rubber  band  marking  through  out  the  experiment.  She/he  should  fill  a  large  beaker  with 
water and stand ready to pour it into the top of the tube. Now, open the valve at the base. 
At the same time, WLM should begin filling water from top, filling at just the right rate to 
maintain  the water  surface  at  the  rubber  band. Once  this  is  perfected,  you  can  determine 
the  flow  rate  Q  by  capturing  a  measured  volume  of  effluent,  Vol.,  over  a  fixed  time 
interval, T, i.e. Q = Vol./T.  Repeat the measurement to find four estimates of Q.  Use the 
four  estimates  to  determine  a  mean  and  standard  deviation.    The  standard  deviation 
represents the uncertainty in the measured quantity Q.   Finally, use equation 3 to estimate 
 
the hydraulic conductivity.  Compare the order of magnitude of your result to the Kozeny-
Carmen Equation (4).
