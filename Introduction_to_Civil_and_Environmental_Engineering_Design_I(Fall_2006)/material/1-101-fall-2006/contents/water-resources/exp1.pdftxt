  Measuring pH  

Calibration of the glass electrode to measure the pH of water. 

Because this project is about pH control, it will be necessary to measure pH, both to test the perfor­
mance of the treatment system that you design and build and to develop design curves that will 
help in the design process. We will use a “glass electrode” to measure pH. An appendix to this 
brief description of lab procedure explains in more detail the function of this instrument. (See also 
the two page article “The Glass pH Electrode” by PetrVanysek posted on our Stellar site). 

The glass electrode, when the tip is submerged in water, produces a voltage linearly related to the 
pH of the water, i.e., 

V  =  ( s l o p e ) ⋅ pH  + V o f f s e t  

where Voffset is a constant for the particular device you have in hand. 

Supplied with three standard calibration solutions (pH buffers) at pH 4, 7, and 10, you can deduce 
measures of the values of the two parameters, the slope and Voffset, by recording the three voltages, 
V, seen when the electrode is submerged into each of these three solutions and fitting a straight line 
to a plot of the Voltage-pH pairs. (Two measurements - say at pH 4 and pH 10 is all one needs - but 
take the three measurements and compare the straight line fit with a two-point, direct determina­
tion of the slope and intercept). 

To obtain a good measure of the glass electrode output signal, V, requires signal conditioning. The 
electrode simply can not deliver the amount of current required to operate most data readout 
devices - a digital voltmeter in our case. The circuit includes an electronic device - an operational 
amplifier or “op-amp” for short - whose input impedance is much higher than the electrode’s and 
whose output is proportional to the op-amp’s input. The op-amp, powered externally, is capable of 
delivering adequate current to a data readout device. See the Appendix for a detailed description of 
this circuit. Your lab instructor will help you make the appropriate connections and explain how 
the circuit functions. 

Record your voltage measurements and do the calculations of the slope and Voffset 
in your lab 
notebook. Summarize the results of your calculation of the slope and Voffset on the next page. You 
will hand in this one page at the end of lab. Include any observations you find of significance. In 
particular, how many significant figures can you claim? What uncertainty, expressed as +/-%, 
would you associate with each parameter?
