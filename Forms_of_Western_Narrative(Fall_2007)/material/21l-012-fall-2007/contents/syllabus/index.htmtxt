Each student will write 3 essays, minimally 7 double-spaced pages apiece; one
of these must be revised after consultation with me.

***** Class Schedule *****
The following schedule shows the reading you should have done by a given day;
it's designed to spread your reading fairly evenly across the semester (for
example, if four class sessions are devoted to a novel, you should read at
least a quarter of the work for each of those sessions). In class, however,
I'll go slower over some parts, faster over others. The schedule is subject to
change, so if you miss a class, check to make sure what's coming next.
***** Special Feature *****
The day before Ses #14, the novelist and short-story author Vikram Chandra will
be visiting MIT for a late afternoon seminar and an evening public reading.
Students of 21L.012 will read Chandra's story "Kama" (from his collection Love
and Longing in Bombay) and are strongly encouraged to attend the seminar and
reading.

***** Student Work *****
As a HASS-D / CI-H class, 21L012 requires substantial practice in analytical
writing and speaking.
   1. 3 take-home essay exams (minimum 7 double-spaced pages each) on Homer,
      Cervantes, and Shelley (respectively). Please use Courier 12-point font
      for all your writing in this class.
   2. A 4th (and last) essay exam, consisting of a substantially revised
      version of one of the previous three. Outside of class, you will work
      with me and with a class partner on your revision; when submitted it must
      be accompanied by a one-page statement reflecting on what you found
      necessary to change, what improvements you attempted to make, why, and so
      forth.
   3. Two oral reports, approximately 10 minutes each, on topics to be
      assigned. Your function on the first of these will be to inform your
      fellow students about a topic relevant to our readings, to do so in the
      clearest and most concise manner, to show you have selected the most
      important information to convey, to deliver your report with a
      professional demeanor and authority. The second report will be a joint
      presentation with your revision partner about the original and final
      versions of your revised papers.
   4. There will be an in-class quiz on Conrad's Heart of Darkness as soon as
      we have finished discussing that work.
***** Guidelines *****
   1. Written work is due either at the beginning of class or, if on a Friday,
      before 5 pm at the Literature office. Hard copies, please; electronic
      versions are acceptable only in special circumstances and if approved by
      me.
   2. Extensions may be arranged, but only if you ask for them in advance of
      the original due date.
   3. No more than two unexcused absences. Beyond that, you will fail the
      course.
          o If you are sick or have to be away for another legitimate reason,
            e-mail me.
          o I may charge you an unexcused absence if you frequently arrive late
            or without your book.
   4. Unannounced quizzes on readings at my discretion.
***** Grading Policy *****
                   Grading criteria.
ACTIVITIES                                   PERCENTAGES
Written work (including quiz)                75%
Oral presentations                           20%
Overall helpfulness of attitude and demeanor 5%

***** Principles of Assessment *****
I expect written work of the same caliber as the work required in your other
MIT subjects. This means carefully composed and proof-read (no sloppy errors),
thorough, well thought-out, sufficiently supplied with supporting material
quoted or paraphrased from the text(s). I make no distinctions between
"content" and "quality of writing." How you decide to state something, how you
assemble an argument, how you construct each and every sentence â these
things constitute your argument and are thus indistinguishable from its
"content." Also, more richly detailed essays, those that take the trouble to
respond very fully to the text and to the questions posed in the assignment,
will receive higher marks than those that give minimal or very general
responses. I will distribute a sample "A" paper (from another class, of
course!) to illustrate the qualities I have described above.
On oral presentations, students will be judged on pertinence, clarity, and
organization of the information presented, as well as on delivery style (the
"professional demeanor and authority" mentioned above).
***** On Plagiarism *****
Plagiarismâuse of another's intellectual work without acknowledgementâis a
serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who
plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will
forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all
information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated
in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken
from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations
from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own
work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution, consult the
style guides available at the MIT's Writing and Communication Center and useful
citations links located here.
