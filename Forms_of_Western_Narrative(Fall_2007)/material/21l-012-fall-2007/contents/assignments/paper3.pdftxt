Remember to observe the guidelines specified on the assignment for exam #1.  Don’t 
forget the signed pledge.  And make sure to review the several pieces of advice I gave 
with assignment #1. 

There is a change to the syllabus: we will NOT have a quiz on Heart of Darkness on 
Tues. Dec. 11. 

This essay will focus on Frankenstein but will also touch on Heart of Darkness. 
Since we will finish discussion the latter work on Dec. 6, your discussion of it may be 
brief, but it should adequately address the questions posed below. 

Choose one of the following: 

1)  A literary work is not like a box with a meaning inside, and reading one is not like 
opening the box and taking out the meaning.  On the contrary, a work of literature 
uses its form to put readers through a certain kind of experience in relation to the 
content it delivers.  Form and content are intimately interrelated, and the way a 
work is told matters as much (or more) as what it tells about.   

So: how does the structure of the narrative in Frankenstein (the way the narrative 
is organized and delivered to us) relate to the ideas with which the novel is 
preoccupied?  What parallel can you see between the structure of Frankenstein 
and that of Heart of Darkness?  What does it mean to regard both works as 
involving a “contest of voices”? 

2)  When people try to describe unprecedented experiences, they usually draw upon 
familiar patterns to try to make sense of them.  Both Frankenstein and Heart of 
Darkness take us to places and types of experience far beyond the common or 
everyday – to say the least.  What patterns derived from the literary and 
mythological traditions of the Western world – in other words, what kinds of prior 
stories – do they draw upon in seeking a template that can adequately encompass 
their new (and terrifying) material?  How adequate are these established patterns 
to their new purposes?
