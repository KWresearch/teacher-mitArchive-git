Topics for paper #1: minimum of 7 pages 
Due Thurs. 10/4, in class 

GUIDELINES ON FORMAT for all papers in this class (retain for future reference): 

1)  Attach a cover sheet to your essay giving a title (a good one), your name, and a 
signed pledge that the paper is entirely your own work.  You should not need to 
consult any outside sources, just your memory and notes.  Now would be the time 
to review the section on Plagiarism on the class syllabus. 

2)  Double space and use a size-12 Courier (or Courier New) font, with margins of 
about 1 inch.  Quotations of longer than 5 lines should be set in on both sides and 
should be double-spaced.  They do NOT need quotation marks around them (the 
setting-in indicates that it’s a quotation). 

3)	 Number your pages.  The cover page should not be numbered.  By convention the 
first page of your text should not show a number, although it is counted as page 1; 
the next page should show 2, and so on. 

4)  Staple the pages in the correct order.  Yes, past experience tells me I have to 
specify this. 

5)  When you quote, follow your quotation with a parenthetical citation giving the 
work’s name (the first time; after that, if you’re quoting only one work, it’s not 
necessary) and the page number.  You don’t need footnotes or endnotes, or a 
“Works Cited” list or bibliography.  When you are quoting from a work divided 
into separate books and marked with line numbers, give the book and line 
numbers as well, after the page number (for example: Odyssey, p. 222, Book XIV, 
lines 66-68). 

ADVICE for all papers written for this class: 

1)  Don’t assume that you can’t use the first-person voice.  “I think” or “it seems to 
me” is OK, as long as you have reasons to back up what you think.  I’d rather 
have you sound like a distinct individual than an impersonal bureaucratic 
committee.   

2)  Quote from and/or paraphrase portions of the text to support your claims as much 
as possible.  Unlike experimental scientists, who seek to arrive at knowledge by 
eliminating variables and narrowing the field of possibilities, we in the humanities 
are looking for responses that seek to take in more, that don’t just identify an issue 
of importance but attempt to see how it plays out in a variety of different settings 
in a literary work or historical context.  Don’t think of your task as one of arriving 
at the tersest statement of a book’s “meaning”; think of it as one of engaging with 
some issue raised by the book in sufficiently satisfying detail.

3)  Don’t assume that your essay has to conform to some ideal model of the 5-
paragraph essay (opening paragraph, 3 paragraphs of “body,” closing paragraph).  
Rather than helpfully providing a structure, this model can become a cage, and it 
encourages a boredom-inducing level of repetition (here’s what I will say, here I 
am saying it, here’s what I have said).  You want to persuade your readers, not hit 
them over the head. 

4)	 Don’t write for the professor.  Write for an imaginary reader who is somewhat 
familiar with the text you’re discussing but needs some reminding about what 
happens when and so forth.  When you discuss a particular passage or incident in 
the text, make sure to contextualize it for this imaginary reader.  When you move 
from one part of the text to another, help the reader move with you by providing a 
sufficient transition.  Explain any foreign-language terms (e.g. biotos, etc.). 
Always be asking yourself if what you’re saying will be clear and persuasive to 
the imaginary reader. 

5)  Keep your opening paragraph focused on the specific claim your paper is making.  
Don’t begin with vast generalizations (e.g. “Throughout the history of Western 
literature”) when your real subject is something specific about a particular text. 

6)  People often think that academic writing is unlike the kind of writing they might 
need to do in the “real world.”  But one way in which the writing in this class is 
exactly like the writing you might do in a professional context is that it is being 
read by someone busy who has a lot of other things to read and who will hold you 
responsible for what you present.

Possible topics for paper #1: choose one. 

1.	 Explain what it means to say that a central theme of the Odyssey is the conflict 
between Poseidon and Athena.  Make sure to consider, along with other things, 
Athena’s behavior at the beginning of book 3 and what difference that makes to 
our sense of this conflict.  Is it a conflict that is likely to end in one side’s victory? 
How does Teiresias’s description, in Book XI, of the final journey that Odysseus 
will have to make help us answer this question? 

2.	 Write about the significance of Odysseus’s trick of naming himself “Nobody” in 
his encounter with the Cyclops.  By “significance” I do not mean simply “what 
that trick leads to in the Cyclops encounter itself,” but what it suggests about all 
of Odysseus’s adventures in books 9-12 and the epic as a whole.  How does the 
encounter with the Cyclops offer a prototype for all of Odysseus’s adventures in 
attempting to get home?  Separate out the various important elements of the 
encounter that help establish it as prototype. 

3. Write about the ways in which the Odyssey exhibits an ancient people’s tendency 
to “externalize” things (like ambivalence, guilt, remorse, recklessness, etc.) that 
we modern folks would tend to represent by reference to “internal” individual 
psychology.  What might this tendency have to do with the oral origins of 
Homer’s epic?
