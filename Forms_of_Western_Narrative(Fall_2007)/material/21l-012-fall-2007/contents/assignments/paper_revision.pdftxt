Revision project (for paper 1 or 2) 

Revisions are due Tuesday, Dec. 11 

Your revision should include a cover page describing the improvements you attempted to 
make, the main problem areas you identified, and the steps you took to address them.  
Limit: 1 double-spaced page. 

You should conceive of the revision process as an opportunity to rethink everything 
about your original essay; do not limit yourself to “fixing” only those things I marked as 
problematic.  You may decide that many things about your original essay are the way you 
want to keep them, but you should have a justification for that decision, just as you 
should have one for any changes you make.  There is no guarantee that a revised essay 
will receive a higher grade than the original.  The grade on the revision will completely 
replace that given to the original. 

In class on Tuesday, Nov. 27, we will form teams of 3 to work collaboratively on the 
revision process.  It will be your responsibility to read each other’s work and meet to 
strategize about the revision process.   

 I will be available, by appointment, to meet with teams during the week of Dec. 3-7; you 
should have met as a team before coming to see me. 

On the final day of class, Tuesday, Dec. 11, each team will make a 10-minute 
presentation on its revision process.  You can elect a team spokesperson or divide the 
time as you see fit.  Remember that you should address your remarks to the rest of the 
class, not just to me.  You should emphasize those aspects of your revision process that 
might be illuminating for the other students. 

Please note: it is imperative that you treat your team members with respect.  Everyone 
can stand to improve, so please make your comments on each other’s work constructive.
