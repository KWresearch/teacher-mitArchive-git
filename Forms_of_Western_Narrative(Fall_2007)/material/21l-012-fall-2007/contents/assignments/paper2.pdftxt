Topics for paper #2 
At least 7 pages, due Tuesday, Nov. 13 

Remember to observe the guidelines specified on the assignment for exam #1.  Don’t 
forget the signed pledge.  And make sure to review the advice I gave with assignment #1. 

Choose one of the following: 

1)  In “The Knight of the Cart,” we have a romance of chivalry that may (some 
readers think) work to undercut or treat with irony some of the ideals of romance 
and chivalry.  In Don Quixote, we have a novel that professes itself devoted to the 
debunking of romance conventions and illusions (see the prologue) yet which 
seems at times to revalidate some aspects of the romance ideals to which Quixote 
devotes himself.  Discuss the possibility that these two works may express 
ambivalence about their ostensible purposes.  Support your claims with analysis 
of specific passages from both texts. 

2)  Focusing on chapter 20 of Don Quixote Part I, write about how we might best 
conceive of the pairing of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.  Draw liberally upon 
passages from other chapters in the text to support your observations, and be as 
specific as possible in developing the relationship between the two. 

3)	 Write about how some tensions or contradictions in Don Quixote’s words and 
behavior may help us feel the “historical moment” of Don Quixote as a time of 
protracted transition from a courtly or feudal society to a market-driven one.  
Quote liberally from the text to support this claim.
