***** Course Description *****
This course examines some leading examples of major genres of storytelling in
the Western tradition, among them epic (Homer's Odyssey), romance (from the
Arthurian tradition), and novel (Cervantes's Don Quixote). We will be asking
why people tell (and have always told) stories, how they tell them, why they
might tell them the way they do, and what difference it makes how they tell
them. We'll combine an investigation of the changing formal properties of
narratives with consideration of the historical, cultural, and technological
factors that have influenced how tales got told. In keeping with its CI-H and
HASS-D label, this course will involve substantial attention to students'
writing and speaking abilities.
