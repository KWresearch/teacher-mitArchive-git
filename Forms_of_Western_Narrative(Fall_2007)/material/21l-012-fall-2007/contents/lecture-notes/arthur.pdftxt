21L.012, Arthurian romances 
 
(4 October) 
 
King Arthur: 
•  1000 year span (5th century – 15th century) of Arthurian legend developing 
•  Note “medieval”: much social change during time 
If Arthur did exist, likely in the 4th century as Romans withdrew 
• 
•  Britain changed significantly after Norman conquest (1066); French was spoken 

 
 
The Art of Courtly Love 
•  Why would the book The Art of Courtly Love catch on? 
•  Marie among the most powerful women in France 
•  Question to reader: was courtly love in “Knight of the Cart” what you expected? 
•  Author does not explain how Lancelot fell in love, because that was widely 
known at the time 
•  Jarring that love was sexual (included adultery); 19th century version of courtly 
love celibate 
•  Pg. 291: she intends to continue affair 

 
 
In “The Knight of the Cart,” what is experience of being in love like? 
•  Pg. 211: the knight gets into cart, which disgraces him; contaminated 
•  Purity important: needed noble spirit to be worthy of love; love is noble 
phenomenon, not among dirty peasants 
•  There’s battle between love and reason 
•  Love triumpths over other concerns (disgrace didn’t matter) 
•  Pg. 225: his reaction to hair almost silly 
•  Medieval Catholicism developed cult around relics; he treats her hair like a relic; 
love takes him over as religion does to many; suggests that love is competition to 
religion 

 
 
Role of women 
• 
In Bible 
o  woman is downfall of man (Eve) 
o  Mariolatry: Mary elevated to semi-divine, merciful 
•  Courtly love: secularizes Mariolatry 
•  Pg. 207: author acknowledges her power, flatters her 
o  Emphasis that she wants him to write distances author from writing 
o  Author may not have believed ideas in story 

 
Overarching tale: Lancelot on quest to rescue other
