(student presentation on Amadis of Gaul) 
 
 
Don Quixote Part 1: 1605, published by itself; 
later, a different author wrote a follow-up, which prompted Cervantes to publish Part 2 in 
1615 
 
Epic: The Odyssey 
 
Romance: Arthurian Romance 
•  characters idealized, contrary to a novel’s realistic characters 

 
novel: Don Quixote 
•  supernatural events occur (e.g., Don Quixote blames enchanter) 

 
novel: new, modern 
•  opposed to romance (Don Quixote mocks romance) 

 
 
In a prologue, what’s the relationship between the author and the addressee? 
•  Cervantes addresses reader 
•  Cervantes’s prologue is less formal than Chretien’s prologue 
•  Chretien distances himself from his patron 
•  Cervantes refers to the idle reader, lowers expectations 
•  Cervantes’s audience: the public, whom he didn’t know, in contrast to Chretien’s 
audience 
•  Cervantes is open about the difficulty of writing prologue; he mocks prologue 
conventions 
•  pg. 15: book mocks chivalry books 
•  pg. 26: Don Quixote deranged by chivalrous books 
•  another interpretation: Don Quixote should be admired for dreaming of something 
better instead of settling for normal life (romantic)

•  Why did Cervantes attribute? 
•  distances author from writing 

 
pg. 76: Arabs are liars
