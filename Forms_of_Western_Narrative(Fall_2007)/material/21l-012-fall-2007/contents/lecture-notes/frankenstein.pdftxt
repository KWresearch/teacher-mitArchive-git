•  Don Quixote: note vision of comic acceptance: tied to worse side of nature 
regardless of efforts: our ability to improve things is limited 

 
recall beginning of Frankenstein 
• 
letters 
•  Walton adds to credibility of story 
•  Walton observed monster 

 
narrative 
Mrs. Saville (cid:205) Walton (cid:205) Frankenstein (cid:205) monster 
•  progressive steps away from social solidarity 
•  Walton can provide pathway to isolation 
•  opening and closing landscapes: barren 

 
What constitutes beautiful and sublime? 
•  Burke: beautiful an experience of happiness; calm and peaceful 
•  sublime: parts of nature that seem indifferent to humans; can make us feel 
insignificant, unimportant (e.g., stormy sea) 
•  beautiful: world we’re at home in 
•  sublime: monster’s experience; world hostile, indifferent 
•  Poseidon: sublime force 
•  Don Quixote’s lower side of human nature 

 
Frankenstein suggests that some part of our soul could be alien to us 
 
Shelley’s perspective 
•  women keep men in touch with social world 

 
the night Frankenstein succeeded 
•  Frankenstein exhausted 
•  has dream 
o  divided between his love of Elizabeth, respect for father and pursuit of 
monster 
o  Elizabeth morphs into dead mother; before mother died, she said to 
Elizabeth, “Elizabeth my love, you must supply my place,” undone in 
dream; mother died after helping Elizabeth 
o  Frankenstein may be motivated subconsciously to render women obsolete 
monster embodies Frankenstein’s side that he does not understand

Alone, alone, all all alone, 
Alone on the wide wide sea 
And never a saint took pity on

My soul in agony. 
-S. T. Coleridge 
“The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” 
 
(student presentation on film versions of Frankenstein) 
 
Coleridge’s work influenced Shelley’s writing 
•  The passage above expresses despair—beyond the redemptive power of God 
•  a recurring theme in Frankenstein 

 
recall the trial of Justine 
•  consider the role of Victor during trial 
•  vol. 1 ch. 8, pg. 86 

 
 
What is the book’s attitude toward Victor? 
•  vol. 1, ch. 4: if everyone stays within the bounds of the familiar, progress is 
slowed 
•  admiration for striving for something new, but needs tradition to balance 
• 
tension between 2 forces 

 
Start of vol. 2: Victor exalts himself in perverse way 
•  exempts himself from advice 
•  monster challenges the primacy of Victor’s misery 
•  competition of who’s most miserable 
•  consider Oedipus the King 
o  goes from best to worst 
o 
tragic hero 
o  retains grandeur during fall 
o  contest between Victor and the monster to be tragic hero of story 
o  vol. 2, ch. 2 

 
Why can Victor in the book Frankenstein inspire sympathy but not Victor in the film 
versions? 
in 1st person narrative (book), tendency to slide from explanation to justification 
• 
•  vol. 2, ch. 1 
“qui s’accuse, s’excuse” he who accuses himself excuses himself
