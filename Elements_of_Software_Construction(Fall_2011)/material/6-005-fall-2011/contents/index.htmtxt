[Several measures of a Bach fugue, with three voices each highlighted in a
different color.]
In Project 1, students design and build a player for abc music notation, which
is capable of synthesizing a multi-voiced Bach fugue like this. (Adapted from
an image by Matt.kaner on Wikipedia.)

***** Course Description *****
This course introduces fundamental principles and techniques of software
development. Students learn how to write software that is safe from bugs, easy
to understand, and ready for change.
Topics include specifications and invariants; testing, test-case generation,
and coverage; state machines; abstract data types and representation
independence; design patterns for object-oriented programming; concurrent
programming, including message passing and shared concurrency, and defending
against races and deadlock; and functional programming with immutable data and
higher-order functions.
The course includes weekly programming exercises and two substantial group
projects.
