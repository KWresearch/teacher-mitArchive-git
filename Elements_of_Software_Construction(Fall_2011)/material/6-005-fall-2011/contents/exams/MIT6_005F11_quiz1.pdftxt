Regular Expressions and Grammars 
 
Consider the following grammar: 
 
F ::=  B? E N* M 
B ::=  > 
E ::=   :  |  ;  |  8 
N ::=   -  |  ^   
M ::=  D | O | P 
 
(a) [8 pts] Which of the following strings could be legally and entirely recognized by the 
grammar? (circle all that apply) 
 
 

 ;P     
 
:-^[     
 
>8O 
 
:^OD 
 
B:^D 
 
<3     
 
O^:         
 
:---D 

 
 
(b) [4 pts] Write a regular expression for this grammar.  You can use any operators from 
common regular expression syntax.  Quoting or escaping is unnecessary if your meaning 
is clear.

State Machines and Testing 
 
Before  going  to  bed  every  night,  Ben  Bitdiddle  turns  on  his  alarm  clock.    It  rings  in  the 
morning  to wake him up, and he  turns  it off.   Sometimes  – not often – he wakes up early 
and turns the alarm off before it has a chance to ring. 
 
(a)  [12  pts]  Draw  a  state  machine  for  the  alarm  clock  below.    Label  the  states  and  the 
transitions,  using  only  the  labels  shown  at  the  right.   Some  labels  may  be  used  more 
than once, and some may be unused.

(b) [3 pts] Devise one or more test cases that together achieve all-transitions coverage for 
this state machine.  Write each test case below, not as Java code but as an event trace -- a 
sequence of event labels from the state machine above.

Specifications  
 
Write good  specifications  for  the  following methods. Do not  change  the  parameter  types 
or  return  type  of  the method,  but  you may  change  other  parts  of  the method  signature  if 
you feel it’s necessary to write a good spec.  
 
/** Compute the square root of a number. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 */ 
public static int squareRoot(int x); 
 
 
// IntSet represents a set of integers. 
public class IntSet { 
    ... // other fields and methods here 
    /** Find the smallest element in the set.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    */ 
    public int smallest();
} 
 
/** Double every number.

public static List<Integer> doubleAll(List<Integer> lst);

Abstract Data Types 
 
Consider the following code. 
 
 1 /** Text is an immutable data type representing English text. */ 
 2 public class Text { 
 3     private final String text; 
 4     private final String[] words; 
 5      
 6     // Rep invariant: 
       //    text != null; words != null; 
 7     //    concatenation of words (words[0]+words[1]+...+words[words.length-1]) 
 8     //       is the same as text with spaces and punctuation removed 
 9     // Abstraction function: 
10     //    represents the English text in the string variable text 
11      
12     /** 
13      * Make a Text object. 
14      * @param sentence a sentence in English.  Requires sentence != null. 
15      */ 
16     public Text(String sentence) { 
17         this.text = sentence; 
18         this.words = sentence.split(" "); 
19     } 
20      
21     /** @return the words in the sentence */ 
22     public String[] getWords() {  
23         return words; 
24     } 
25      
26     /** @return the sentence as a string */ 
27     public String toString() { 
28         return text; 
29     } 
30      
31     /** concatenates this Text to that Text. Requires that != null. */ 
32     public Text add(Text that) { 
33         return new Text(this.text + that.text); 
34     } 
35 
 
36     /** @return true if and only if the word w is in the sentence.  
37           Requires w != null */ 
38     public boolean contains(String w) {  
39         for (String v : words) { if (w.equals(v)) { return true; } } 
40         return false; 
41     }

(a) [5 pts] For each constructor and method above, write in the box next to it: 
C for creator 
 
 
 
 
P for producer 
O for observer 
 
 
 
 
M for mutator 
 
(b)  [18  pts] The  code  above was  code-reviewed,  producing  the  comments below.   Circle 
AGREE  or  DISAGREE  depending  on  whether  the  comment  is  correct  or  incorrect,  and 
add  your  own  one-sentence  comment  explaining  your  answer.   The  right  explanation  is 
worth more than the right circle.

WordSet = Base(t:Text) + Intersect(left:WordSet, right:WordSet) 

Recursive Data Types 
 
In this problem you will implement a recursive data type representing sets of words and 
intersections of those sets.  The datatype definition is: 
 
 
 
(a) [15pts] Write Java code below that implements this datatype. Include the reps (fields) 
and creators (constructors), but no other methods.  You don’t need to write specs for 
your methods in this problem.  Note that you will need to use the Text datatype defined 
in the previous problem; assume that all its implementation bugs have been fixed so that 
it behaves according to its spec.

 Name:  

(b) [15pts] Define a function over your datatype: 
contains: WordSet ws, String w => boolean 
 
// requires: w is a word, with no spaces or punctuation 
 
 
// returns: true if and only if w is an element of the  
 
 
//               set of words represented by ws  

 
Implement the function using the Interpreter pattern.  Write your Java code below.  
Again, you don’t need to write specs for this problem.  You also don’t need to repeat the 
code you wrote above, but if you need to insert methods into classes you wrote above, 
just put a brief outline around it with the name of the class, e.g. 
   ClassName { 
       public void myNewMethod() { 
 
... 
 
       } 
   }
