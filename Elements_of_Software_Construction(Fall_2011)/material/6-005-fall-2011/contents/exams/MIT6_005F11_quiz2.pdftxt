Design Patterns [20 pts] 
 
For each of the following statements, name the design pattern that it best describes, from the list 
below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You may use a design pattern more than once in your answers.  If you’re torn between two best 
answers, you can give both, but in that case you should justify both answers. 
 
 

Interpreter 
Visitor 
Event Listener 
Map/Filter/Reduce 
Client/Server 
Model/View/Controller 
Composite 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

  
 
 

(a)  This design pattern produces tree-like data structures. 

(b)  This design pattern is used for operating over sequences of elements. 

(c)  This design pattern uses higher-order functions. 

(d)  This design pattern is used to separate concerns in user interfaces.  

(e)  This design pattern is used for message passing over a network.

 Name:  

Interpreter/Visitor [16 pts] 
 
You want to write a program to perform operations on all your Foos.   
 
A Foo can perform lots of different tricks, like bazzle and glibble.  
 
There are (and will always be) exactly 4 types of Foo, each of which does something different 
when they bazzle or glibble.  
 
But every so often your Foos learn a new trick, and you must update your program to include the 
new operation.  
 
For example, last week your Foos learned how to joople. 
 
 
a) Would it be better to use the interpreter pattern or the visitor pattern  for implementing the 
datatype representing a Foo? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) Assuming you designed your program according to your choice in part (a) , now you want to 
add the joople operation.  Explain what classes and methods you will change, or what classes 
and methods you would add, in order to support the joople operation.

 Name:  

Map/Filter/Reduce [12 pts] 
 
Suppose you want to rewrite the following Python code using map, filter, and reduce:  
 
def ssp(list):     # sum of squares of positive numbers in list 
    result = 0 
    for x in list: 
        if x > 0: 
            result += x*x 
    return result 
 
 
 
Fill in the blanks in the map/filter/reduce version below.  
 
 
def ssp(list):     # sum of squares of positive numbers in list 
    return reduce(r, map(m, filter(f, list)), 0) 
 
 
def f(                                      ): 
 
 
    return                                          .                                       
 
 
 
def m(                                      ): 
 
 
    return                                          .                                       
  
 
 
def r(                                      ): 
 
 
    return                                          .

Concurrency [16 pts] 
 
Read the following code: 
 
    public static void main() { 
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new Runnable() { 
            public void run() { 
                System.out.print("O"); 
                System.out.print ("Y"); 
            } 
        }); 
        Thread t2 = new Thread(new Blue()); 
        System.out.print("R"); 
        t1.start(); 
        System.out.print("G"); 
        t2.start(); 
        System.out.print("I"); 
        t1.join(); 
        System.out.print("V"); 
        t2.join(); 
        System.out.print("K"); 
    } 
 
    public static class Blue implements Runnable { 
        public void run() { 
            System.out.print("B"); 
        } 
    } 
 
Assume that print() is threadsafe and atomic. Which of the following sequences can be printed by 
this code?  Circle possible or impossible.

 Name:  

Deadlock [16 pts] 

You have two threads (T0 and T1) and two locks (X and Y).  Which of the following situations can 
lead to deadlock?  If deadlock can occur, circle the method call in each thread where the thread 
would stop in the event of deadlock.  If deadlock is impossible, circle “no deadlock.” 

a) 

 

 

b)  

 

 

c) 

 

 

T0:  
X.acquire();  
Y.acquire(); 
Y.release(); 
X.release(); 

T1: 
X.acquire();  
Y.acquire(); 
X.release(); 
Y.release(); 

 

 

no deadlock 

T0: (same as T0 above) 
X.acquire();  
Y.acquire(); 
Y.release(); 
X.release(); 

T1: 
Y.acquire();  
X.acquire(); 
X.release(); 
Y.release(); 

 

 

no deadlock 

T0: (same as T0 above) 
X.acquire();  
Y.acquire(); 
Y.release(); 
X.release(); 

T1: 
Y.acquire();  
Y.release(); 
X.acquire(); 
X.release();

Thread Safety [20 pts] 
 
Consider the following code, and answer the questions on the next page. 
 
public class Widget extends Thread { 
    public static List<String> strings = new ArrayList<String>(); 
    public int count; 
    public List<Integer> numbers; 
 
    public Widget() { 
        count = 0; 
        numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>(); 
    } 
 
    public void run() { 
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) { 
            synchronized (this) { 
                count++; 
                synchronized (numbers) { 
                    numbers.add(i); 
                } 
                synchronized (Widget.strings) { 
                    Widget.strings.add(“x”); 
                } 
            } 
        } 
    } 
 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        List<Widget> widgets = new ArrayList<Widget>(); 
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) { 
            Widget w = new Widget(); 
            widgets.add(w); 
            w.start(); 
        } 
        for (Widget w : widgets) { 
            synchronized (w) { 
                w.count++; 
                synchronized (w.numbers) { 
                    w.numbers.add(1000); 
                } 
            } 
            synchronized (Widget.strings) { 
                Widget.strings.clear(); 
            } 
        }

            w.join(); 
        } 
    }

You are reviewing a concurrency argument about this code.  Circle whether you agree or 
disagree with each of the following statements in the concurrency argument, and add a brief (1 
sentence) justification of your answer.  
 
 
(a) Accesses to the widgets list are safe because the list is confined to the main thread.
