Amendment

The design amendment is to incorporate a typing status for each user in a conversation. This 
functionality is implemented in Google Talk; the UI alerts you when your conversation partner 
is currently typing, or has entered text.

Each user should be in one of three states: no_text, is_typing, has_typed. no_text is the start 
state. A user can transition into is_typing by starting to type into the UI corresponding to the 
given conversation. A user transitions into has_typed if a certain amount of time has elapsed. 
This time window is up to you to decide. A user can re-enter the is_typing state from 
has_typed by typing again, or by backspacing over text they have already typed. Sending the 
current message will get you back to no_text. It is up to you to decide if deleting all the text 
can also get you back to no_text. 

You can display this information as a change in the UI of the conversation (e.g. Alice is 
typing...), or into the buddy list UI (by changing the color of the user, or making the user 
italics, or ...). All three states should be easily distinguishable in your UI, regardless of how 
you choose to display this information to the user. This information has to be pushed to users 
by the server; it is not acceptable for users to be forced to click a button in order to get their 
partner's typing status.

Note that if user A is typing to user B in a conversation between only them, it shouldn't 
appear to user C that user A is in the is_typing state. Stated another way, user A should only 
be seen as typing by user C if user C is involved in a conversation with user A where user A is 
typing. Thus, you should logically have a state machine corresponding to each (user, 
conversation) pair.
