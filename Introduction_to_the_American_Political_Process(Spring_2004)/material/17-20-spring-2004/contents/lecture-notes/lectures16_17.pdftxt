The Structure of Public Opinion

(cid:122) What structures public opinions?
(cid:123)Ideology?
(cid:122)Zaller – top of the head
(cid:122)People do not have a single “true attitude” on an 
issue
(cid:122)More fractured view
(cid:123)Look to multiple bases of structure --
considerations

Kinder’s Model

(cid:122) What determines individual opinion?

matter
(cid:123)Draft
(cid:123)Women’s issues
(cid:123)School desegregation
(cid:123)Gun control laws

Self Interest vs. Symbolic Politics

(cid:122) Vote Choice
(cid:123)Individual’s personal economic situation does 
not determine the vote
(cid:123)Perception of national economic situation is 
important
(cid:122) Importance of mediated reality
(cid:122)Ex: 1992 Election

Social Groups

thinking
(cid:123) Group utility heuristic?
(cid:123) Contextual cues?
(cid:123) Example: Race (more next week)

groupings.
(cid:123)Example: WWII

**=p<.01 *=p<.01

† Question Wording:
In the United States the Jews have the same standing as any other people, and they 
should be treated in all ways exactly as any other Americans
Jews are in some ways distinct from other Americans but they make respected and 
useful citizens so long as they don’t try to mingle socially where they are not wanted
Jews have somewhat different business methods and therefore some measures should 
be  Taken to prevent Jews from getting too much power in the business world
We should make it a policy to deport Jews from this country to some new homeland as 
fast as it can be done without inhumanity
