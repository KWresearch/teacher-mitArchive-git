***** Course Overview *****
Welcome to Introduction to the American Political Process. This course, as the
title implies, is intended to present you with an introduction to American
government and the political system. This is not a history course, nor is it a
class on current affairs (though both of these subjects are critical to the
study of political science). Instead, we will focus on currents of thought
among social scientists about the workings of U.S. politics and develop a
systematic way to think about political institutions, behaviors, and traditions
in the United States.
***** Requirements and Expectations *****
You are expected to attend lecture and sections. You are further expected to
come prepared to discuss the issues raised in the readings. Please read the
assigned materials before class on the date they are listed. Feel free to ask
questions about current events, assigned readings, or lecture material during
or after lecture.
To meet the purpose of the course, you will be expected to both consume and
digest readings from scholarly and journalistic sources. You are also expected
to be aware of current events, especially relating to American politics. I
highly recommend that you subscribe to and read a national newspaper, such as
the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times.
Lectures are an important part of the class. However, in two hours a week, I
can only hope to provide you with an introduction to the material. The lectures
will attempt to give you a framework for thinking about the readings.
Hopefully, they will help you build a more comprehensive picture of each week's
topic from the assigned texts.
Grading
This is a communication intensive course. As such you are required to write at
least 25 pages and participate in class discussions. Your grade will be
determined as follows:
   1. 20 percent participation: Regular attendance and participation in class
      discussion is required.
   2. 20 percent weekly assignment: Each Tuesday, you will be given a short
      assignment to complete by the Thursday class. These assignments will help
      prepare you to write the three papers due during the course of the
      semester.
   3. 45 percent papers: Over the course of the semester, you will write three
      6-8 page papers. The papers are due onÂ Lecture 7,Â Lecture 11,
      andÂ Lecture 14. Details concerning these assignments will be handed out
      in class two weeks before the paper is due. The first paper will be
      rewritten based on comments form your TAs and turned in onÂ Lecture 11.
   4. 15 percent observation paper. During the first month or so of the course
      I would like you to attend the meeting of a local governmental bodyÂ â
      city council, school board, state legislature, or court. You are to write
      a paper at least five pages in length on your observations. What is the
      authority of the body you observed? Who is on this body and how is it
      organized? What issues or cases did the organization address at the
      meeting you attended? Who attended the meeting and who participated in
      the meeting? How did the deliberations go (that is, who spoke about
      what)? What decisions were made and how? Finally, offer observations
      about what you learned about decision-making within this body (even if
      obvious).
I expect that all papers will be turned in on time: no exceptions; no excuses.
In addition, plagiarism is entirely unacceptable. Should you turn in a
plagiarized paper, appropriate University sanctions will be pursued. If you are
unclear what constitutes plagiarism, please talk to me. Finally, grades for
your paper will be based on both substance and style. The papers will be graded
on the quality of thought and analysis, the research you do, and the quality of
writing. Use proper grammar, appropriate language and (please, please, please)
proofread and spell-check the final copy of you paper before turning it in.
