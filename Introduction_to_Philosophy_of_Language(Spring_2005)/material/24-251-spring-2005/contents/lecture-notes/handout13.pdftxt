XIII  GRICE: IMPLICATURE 

The  temptation  to  multiply  senses,  and  the  effects  on  this  on  the  attempt  to  give  a 
straightforward  account  of  the  semantics  of  Engl ish.  The mean ing of  ‘and’: They  had  a  child 
and  go t  married.  They  got  marr ied  and  had  a  child .  The  meaning  of  the  indicative 
conditional. 

Conversational and Conventional Implicature 
Conventional implicatures : ‘therefore’; ‘bu t’.

Conversational implicature: not res iding in the lex ical meaning of the words  involved.


The Cooperative Principle 
Make  your  conversational  contribution  such  as  is  required,  at  the  stage  of  the  conversation  at 
which  it  occurs,  by  the  accepted  purpose  of  direction  of  the  talk  exchange  in  which  you  find 
yourself.  In particular : 

Quantity:	

Quality	

Make your contr ibution as informative as requ ired 
? Do not make it more informative 

Don’t say what you believe to be false 
Don’t say that for which you lack evidence. 

RelationBe relevant (subsumes the second quantity rule?) 

Manner	

Avoid obscurity, ambiguity, prol ixity, disorderliness. 

Why? Contractual bas is?  Precondition for any communication? 

Could  there be societies  in which these maxims are not met?  (In  particular, manner  seems  less 
secure) 

The origins of conventional implicatures 
Conventional  Impl icature  ar ising  from  apparently  flouting  (not  just  violating)  one  or  more  of 
these  maxims,  whilst  still  being  cooperative.  The  need  for  an  argument  
in  cases  of  a 
conversational  impl icature.

Other features of conventional implicatures 
Cancellability (un like conventional impl icature)

Nondetachability  (unlike conventional implicature)

Implicature is not part of the meaning  (unl ike conventional implicature)

Implicature  is  not  part  of  what  is  said,  or  part  of  the  truth  conditions  (l ike  conventional

implicature)


Does this help w ith the Kr ipke explanation of  the Donnellan cases?


Indicative Conditionals 
How do we understand the ind icative conditional in English?


Problem:  if  the  ind icative  cond ition  is  interpreted  as  the mater ial  conditional,  then  from B we

can infer If A then B; and from not-A we can infer If A then B, for arbitrary B.


Grice’s  response:  the  problem  is  that,  if  you  are  in  a  pos ition  to  assert  B,  you  shouldn’t  asset

the weaker If A then B.


Problem: but that is so  regard ing the inference B to A or B.  Yet that doesn ’t seem an incorrect

inference.  Moreover,  whilst  in  some  cases  the  explanation  citing  conversational  impl icatures

does seem to do the job, in others it doesn’t.  Contrast:


I’ll come to the party if my ex-wife  is there (and I ’ll come if she isn ’t)

I’ll come to the party if I sustain ser ious injur ies on the way (since I won’t)


Jackson ’s response: the  conditional br ings a  conventional  implicature  that P(A→B/A)  is  high.

(The indicative  cond itional  indicates the robustness of  the corresponding mater ial cond itional

with respect to its antecedent.)
