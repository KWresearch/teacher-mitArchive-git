II  ‘ON SENSE & REFERENCE’ 

The Metalinguistic Approach to Identity 

Frege starts by explain in g the approach th at he used to take to identity, in which 

a = b 

is held  to be, not about a and b d irectly, but rather about the terms ‘a’  and  ‘b ’.  In other words  it 
is equ ivalent to: 

‘a’  and ‘b’ co-refer 

in which  ‘a ’  and  ‘b ’  are mentioned  and  not used. Frege  now  rejects this  account s ince  it wou ld 
h ave  the  consequence  that  an  identity  sentence  wou ld  express  ‘no  genu ine  knowledge ’.  He  is 
not deny in g  th at  it wou ld  express  no knowledge; but  it wou ld  be knowledge  about words,  not 
about the world.  To  see this, cons ider  a  case  in which  I  introduce  a  new  term,  let’s  s ay  ‘T iger 
Town ’ to refer to Pr inceton.  Then 

Tiger Town is Pr inceton 

doesn ’t  tel l  you  an ythin g  about  Pr inceton,  but  it  is  n onetheless  true  ( and  l in gu istica l l y 
informative) that 

‘Tiger Town ’ and  ‘Pr inceton ’ co-refer 

In contrast an  identity sentence l ike 

The Morn in g Star is the Even in g Star 

gives us real information about the Morn in g Star. 

There are other problems with the metal in gu istic approach : 
(i ) where does it stop?  ( ‘a is the same size as b’) 
(i i) what about mixed uses? ( ‘a and b are both planets, and  in fact are identical ’) 
(i ii ) what happens with trans l ation? 

Sense 

Now  it is plau sible to  connect with a sign not only the designated object, which may be 
called  the  refe rence o f  the  sign, but also  the  sense o f  the  sign, in which is  contained the 
manne r and context of pre sentation. (200) 

In  the  ca se  of  genuinely  proper  name s  like  ‘A ristotle’,  opinions  a s  to  the  sense  may 
differ … (n.2)

Different terms  can  h ave  d ifferent  senses  but the  same  reference;  they  can  h ave the  same  sense 
and  the same reference; but they cannot h ave the same sense and  d ifferent reference.  What  are 
senses?  Modes of presentation?  Descriptions? 

Sense without Reference 

Frege s ays that this is poss ible, and g ives examples from astrology  and mathematics. A sentence 
contain in g  an  empty  n ame  wil l  l ack  a  truth-value.  But  the  sentence  does  not  assert  that  the 
n ame  has  a  reference.  Rather  it presupposes  it  (p.  206)  [Question :  wh at  account  can  now  be 
given of negative existenti a ls? ] 

Indirect Discourse 

Words  in  ind irect d iscourse  are held  to h ave  as  their reference what  is stand ard l y their sense. 
Then  we  can  mainta in  the  thesis  that  the  substitution  of  co-referr in g  express ions  does  not 
chan ge the truth value of a sentence; it is just th at, in ind irect d iscourse, sameness of reference is 
on ly given when we would norma l l y have sameness of sense. 

Distinguish senses from images (ideas) 

Ideas are subjective. (Worry: Can we keep senses d istinct from ideas?  The Third Realm.) 

The Sense and Reference of a Sentence 

The proposition  is the sense of a sentence.  (For ‘proposition ’ Frege uses the term ‘der Ged anke’, 
which  is normal l y trans l ated ‘thought ’)  So what is the reference? 

We  have  realized  that  we  are  to  look  fo r  the  refe rence  of  a  sentence  wheneve r  the 
refe rence  o f  the  sentence-components  a re  the  thing  that matter s;  and  that  is  the  case 
wheneve r and only when we ask fo r the truth value. 
Thu s  we  find  our selves  per suaded  to  accept  the  truth-value  of  a  sentence  as  it s 
refe rence. (203) 

Isn ’t the truth-va lue a property of a proposition?  No; to ascr ibe truth to a proposition to just to 
say what is said by the sentence that expresses that proposition. 

What  intere st s  u s  can  therefo re  never  be  me rely  the  refe rence;  but  the  p ropo sition 
alone doe s not give knowledge; only  the p ropo sition  together  with its  refe rence,  i.e. its 
truth-value,  does.  Judging  may  be  viewed  as  a  movement  f rom  a  propo sition  to  its 
refe rence, i.e. its truth-value. (203)

Ind irect discourse 

Other propositiona l attitudes ( and rel ated constructions): 
X fears th at he wil l never see the Morn in g Star aga in 
Columbus  inferred  from  the  round ness  of  the  E arth  th a t  he  cou ld,  travel ing  West, 
reach Ind i a 
He opened the window so that he cou ld see the Even in g Star 
She commanded that he shou ld seek the Morn in g Star 

Sentences contain in g subord in ate clauses 
He who d iscovered  the  elliptical shape  of  the  planetary orbits d ied  in misery 
The squ are root of four whi ch  is smaller  than  zero 

Dependent clauses that involve impl icit conjunction 
Napoleon,  who  recogn ized  the  d an ger  to  his  r ight  f lan k,  person al l y  led  his  troops 
aga in st the enemy’s position 

Other truth functiona l connectives 
If, then 
Although, but, yet (“il lumin ate [the sense] in a pecu l i ar fashion”) 

Factives and Anti-F actives 
Bebel  imag ines th at Fr ance’s des ire for vengeance cou ld be assu aged by the restitution 
of Als ace-Lorraine (German verb is ‘wähnen ’ ) 
Bebel knew that France had  lost the war of 1870 

Caus a l sentences 
Napoleon person a l l y led his troops aga inst the enemy’s pos ition because he recogn ized 
the dan ger to his right fl ank 
Because ice is l ighter than water, it floats on water 

The  clau se,  while it  does denote  a  truth-value,  is not  re stricted  to  this  function  in  that 
its sen se comp ri se s, be side one propo sition, also part of anothe r . (210)
