XII  AUSTIN ON PERFORMATIVES 

The Nature of a Performative Utterance 
Utterance in which we do something rather than simply say something 
Not a report on the action bu t a performance of the action 
Not true or false 

Infelicities 

Misfire (act not performed): 
The convention does no t exist 
Circumstances are no t right 
Act is not performed fully and correctly 

Insincerity (act performed ins incerely, etc): 
Agents lack the necessary mental states 

Misunderstanding (act performed but no t taken up) 

Duress (act performed, bu t no responsibil ity) 

Pretence (act not really performed) 

Marks of Performatives 
Distinction  between  first  person  present  use  (‘I  apologize)  and  second  or  third  person  ( ‘He 
apologizes ’), and past or future tense use (‘I w ill apologize’) 

Explicit  performative  markers.  Can  all  performatives  be  reduced  to  these?  According  to 
Austin,  such  markers  are  not  to  be  understood  as  providing  statements  that  you  are 
performing the actions, but as indicators that you are. 

Problems 
I apologize; I ’m sorry; I feel awful about  it  (cf. I am apologizing) 
The rul ings of juries and umpires .

Are  statements  so  d ifferent  to  performatives?  Isn’t  the  act  of  stating  a  kind  of  performative? 
Parallels  to  infelicities :  ‘The  cat  is  on  the  mat  bu t  I  don’t  bel ieve  that  it  is ’;  ‘I  promise  that  I 
shall be there , but I haven ’t the least intention of being there.’ 

Austin’s other work 
How to Do Things with Words 

Locutionary act: to utter a sentence w ith a given sense and  reference 

Illocutionary  act:  to  perform  an  act  in u tter ing  a  sentence  (e.g.  to  threaten);  this  is  no t  caused 
by the u tterance bu t is rather part of what the utterance is. 

Perlocu tionary  act:  to  achieve  something  by u tter ing  a  sentence  (e.g.  to  persuade;  to  frighten); 
this  is a causal effect of the utterance. 

The  performatives  are  a  subset  of  the  illocutionary  acts;  a  proper  subset,  since  asserting  is  an 
illocution.  Illocutionary  acts  can  be  achieved  non-verbally;  but,  Austin  thinks,  they  must  still 
be conventional.
