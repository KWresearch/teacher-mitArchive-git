XVII  PROPOSITIONAL ATTITUDES: FREGE & DAVIDSON 

Frege’s account 
Words  in  the  complement  sentence  of  a  propositiona l  attitude  report  refer  to  what  i s 
customar il y their sense. 

Worries for Frege 
Wh at happens to interated reports?

Wh at  h appens  to  an aphor ic  dependence  and  qu antif ication  into  or  out  of  proposition a l

attitude reports?

Are  there  such  thin gs  as  senses  to  do  the  job?  In  particu l ar,  the more we  are  pushed  toward s

id io lects, the more problematic the var ious an aphor ic relations become.

How do we make the substitutions th at we regu l ar l y make, e.g. replacin g  index ica ls with n ames

or other index icals ?


Davidson’s Paratactic Analysis 
(1)  Gal ileo said th at the Earth moves. 
(2)  Gal ileo said th at. The Earth moves. 
(3)  ∃x (Gal ileo’s utterance x and my next utterance make us samesayers). The Earth moves. 

Some n ice (?) features :

No need for Fregean senses, propositions or the l ike.

Words  in the complement perform their stand roles.

Words  in the complement are used not mentioned.

We can keep to the surface gr ammar  (?)


Worries for Davidson 
Is  the  complement  ‘th at ’  real l y  a  demonstrative  (notwithstand in g  the  OED pass age);  wh at  of

other lan gu ages?

Cla ims about sentences th at wou ld h ave been uttered.

Cla ims  about  never  uttered  sentences  (Kr ipke)  ‘No  one’s  ever  said  th at  aardvarks  make  good

attorneys ’

The countin g problem (McFetridge):

The E arth moves.

Gal i leo said th at.

The E arth moves.

Th at ’s another thin g Gal i leo said.


How innocent is the samesaying relation?

Can we genera l ize to belief and other proposition al attitud e reports?
