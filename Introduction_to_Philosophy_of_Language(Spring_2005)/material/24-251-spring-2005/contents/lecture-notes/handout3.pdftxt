III  RUSSELL ON DENOTING 

Knowledge by Acquaintance and by Description 

Know ledge of  ind ivid u a ls  comes  in  two forms.  We can  know  an  ind ivid u a l  by being  d irectly 
acqu a inted with it. Or we can know it (or know of it, as we might s ay ), via  a descr iption. Russel l 
makes it clear that he thinks knowledge by acqu aintance is primar y: 

All thinking has to  start from acquaintance (212) 

Every  p ropo sition  which  we  unde r stand  mu st  be  compo sed  wholly  of  constituents 
with which we are acquainted (Problems of Philosophy p. 32) 

Much  of  Russel l ’s  l ater  work  cons ists  in  tryin g  to  an a l yze  the  ways  th at  this  ground in g  is 
supposed  to  work:  reducin g  each  proposition  to  its  constituents.  (Russel l  u ltimately  thought 
that the on ly thin gs we were tru ly acqu ainted with were momentary sense d ata.) ‘On Denoting ’, 
however,  is  concerned  w ith  the  prior  question  of  how  express ions  of  lan gu age  can  come  to be 
about  things  th at  we  know  on ly  vi a  descr iption.  This  relation  is  the  relation  of  denotation;  it 
contrasts with the re ference rel ation which obtains between terms and objects with which we are 
d irectly acqu ainted. 

Quantifiers 

Russel l wanted  to make do with  just one qu antif ier : the  un ivers al.  He does  it here by  a  r ather 
cumbersome metal in gu istic method : 

C (everything ) means  ‘C (x) is always true’

C (nothin g) means ‘ “C(x)  is false” is alw ays true’

C (something ) means  ‘It is false that “C (x) is false” is always true’


(Russel l says that ‘C(x)  is alw ays true’ is to be understood as  ‘u ltimate and  indef in able’; but we 
can  get  some gr ip on  it by  think ing  that  ‘always ’  here  (p.213) means  somethin g  l ike:  ‘for  every 
instanti ation of the var i able’). 

We wou ld now do it rather d ifferently, sayin g (rough l y) th at a sentence of the form 
∀x C(x) 
is true just in case every object in the domain s atisf ies ‘C’ ( a n object α s atisf ies ‘C’ iff α is C), an d 
then defin ing the existenti al quantif ier in terms of the un iversal : 
∃x C(x) =def ~∀x ~C(x)

Definite Descriptions 
On Russel l ’s account 
The father of Char les II was executed 
becomes: 
It is not alw ays  f alse of x that x fathered Ch ar les II, and  that x was executed, and  th at 
‘if y fathered Char les II, y is identica l with x ’ is alw ays true of y 
Or, simpl if ied, and without the problematic metal in gu istic component: 

∃x (x fathered Char les II, and x was executed, and ∀y if y fathered Char les II then y = x) 

Informativeness of Identity 
How shou ld we an a l yze 
George IV wanted to know whether Scott was the author of Waver ley? 

Not as 

But as 

George IV wanted to know whether a = b 

George IV wanted to know whether ∃x (x wrote Waverley, and ∀y if y wrote Waverley 
then y = x and x = Scott) 
Note that  if  you  think  of  Frege’s  senses  as  being  g iven  by  defin ite  descr iptions,  then Russel l ’ s 
theory here is a vers ion of Frege’s not an  altern ative to it. 

Note too that Russel l d istin gu ishes his solution from 
∃x  (x wrote Waver ley, and ∀y  if y wrote Waverley then y = x, and George IV wanted 
to know whether x = Scott) 
In  this  sentence  the  defin ite  descr iption  has  a  pr imary  occurrence  (or  as  we  wou ld  more 
normal ly  s ay today, has w ide scope).  Compare Russel l ’s ex ample of the touchy yacht owner (p. 
217). 

Excluded Middle 
The Law of the Exclu ded M id d le states that al l sentences of the form 
(Fa v ~Fa) 
are val id. (This  is actu a l l y  subtly d ifferent from the claim that either  ‘F a’ or ‘~F a ’ must be true, 
which  is  wh at  Russel l  gives;  this  l atter  is  now  usu a l l y  ca l led  ‘bivalence’.  Accord in g  to  some 
theories (most notably supervalu ation) the two come apart sometimes.)

But we don ’t want to assert: 
E ither the Kin g of France is bald, or The Kin g of France is not bald 
However,  on  Russel l ’s  account,  that  is  not  natur a l l y  read  as  an  instance  of  the  Law  of  the 
Exclu ded M id d le.  The  natur a l  read in g  is one  in which the  defin ite descr iption  in  the second 
conjunct has wide scope over the negation : 
∃x  (x  rega l l y  ru les over France, and ∀y  if y regal l y ru les over France then y = x, and  x 
is bald ) or ∃x  (x regal l y ru les over France, and ∀y  if y rega l l y ru les over France then  y 
= x, and ~x is bald ) 
In  contrast, the  instance of the Law of the Exclu ded M id d le  is one  in which  the  negation  h as 
wide scope over the 
∃x  (x  rega l l y  ru les over France, and ∀y  if y regal l y ru les over France then y = x, and  x 
is bald ) or ~∃x  (x  rega l l y  ru les over France, and ∀y  if y rega l ly  ru les over France then 
y = x, and x is bald ) 
or, as we might put it in (r ather stilted) En g l ish 
E ither  the  Kin g  of Fr ance  is  bald,  or  it  is  not the  case  that  there  is  a  u n ique  Kin g  of 
France who is bald 

Empty terms 
Al l mean in gfu l  terms do refer. But mean in gfu l descr iptions need not denote.  If they h ave wide 
scope, they w il l  alw ays  be  false.  But  if  they h ave  narrow  scope, they may be true ( as  in  the  l ast 
conjunct  of  the  last example).  There  is  no  need  for  a Meinon gi an  notion  of  subs istence. (But 
wh at of terms?)
