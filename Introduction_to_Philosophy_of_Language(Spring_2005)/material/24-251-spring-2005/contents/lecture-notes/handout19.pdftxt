XIX  PROPOSITIONAL ATTITUDES: CRIMMINS & PERRY 

Problems with the naïve view 
(i )  straightforward  u n intu itive consequences.  So un intu i tive that  it might seem that we’ve lost 
track of the idea that mean in g is use. 
(i i)  if  the  explan ation  of  the  un intu itive  consequences  is  supposed  to  be  in  terms  of 
conversation al 
impl icature,  do  we  get  the  stand ard  Gr icean  features :  Cancel l abil ity, 
Nondetachabil ity? 

Two theses it would be nice to maintain 
Semantic Innocence 
(1) 
(2) 
Direct Reference (M il l i an ism) 

Is  it  possible  to  mainta in  these  two  theses  and  yet  stil l  think  that  substitutin g  coreferenti a l 
n ames  in  proposition a l  attitude  ascr iptions  can  ch an g e  truth-va lue.  In  effect  Davidson ’ s 
account  ach ieved  th at; or  cou ld  h ave  done,  depend in g  on  qu ite  how  the  samesayer  relation  i s 
u nderstood.  The tr ick was to find  some other part of the ascr iption sentence (i.e. other th an the 
complement sentence) whose reference ch an ges when coreferenti al  terms  are substituted  in  the 
complement  sentence.  For  Davidson  this  is  the  complementizer  ‘th at ’.  But  th at  approach  r a n 
into var ious problems. Is it possible to attribute the job to some other part of the sentence? 

Crimmins and Perry 
For Crimmins and Perry the job is done by ‘u n articu l ated constituents ’. Compare sentences l ike 
‘It  is  three o’clock’  or  ‘It  is  r a in in g ’.  To  determine  the  fu l l  semantic  content  of  these  sentences 
they  need  to  be  supplemented  w ith  a  reference  to  place.  Typica l l y  this  wil l  be  the  place  of 
utterance;  but  it  need  not  be  (cons ider  how  they  might  be  used  in  a  phone  convers ation  to 
someone a long way aw ay). We can think of the reference as being achieved by an u n articu l ated 
constituent, which, if articu l ated, wou ld g ive r ise to somethin g  l ike ‘It is three o’clock at p’, where 
‘p’ ran ges over places. (It is an  interesting question, on which Cr immins and Perry remain open, 
as to whether these ‘un articu l ated constituents’ are real l y present in some way in the sentence.) 

The  next  step  is  to  real ize  that  the  reference  of  such  u n articu l ated  constituents  can  be  a 
l in gu istic entity. To see how this works it is helpfu l to start with Cr immins ’ d iscuss ion  (in Talk 
About Belie fs) of Qu ine ’s famous example 

(1)  Giorgione was so cal led because of his s ize. 

Clear ly  here  the  term  ‘Giorgione’  refers  to  Giorgione;  but  equ al l y  clear ly,  substitutin g  the 
coreferenti a l  term ‘B arbarel l i ’ ch an ges  the truth-va lue of the sentence.  Crimmins su ggests that 
‘so’ functions as a demonstrative denoting a n ame, so that (1) can be par aphr ased as 

(2)  Giorgione was cal led th at because of his size.

Crimmins points out that whilst in  a typica l use of (1) ‘so’ wil l refer to the name ‘Giorgione ’ th at 
is used ear l ier in the sentence, in the right context it need not.  Cons ider the (false!) sentences 

(3)	 Both Giorgione and Titi an were known as ‘The Giant ’.  Giorgione was so-
cal led because of his size; in Titi an ’s case it was his towerin g skil l th at gave 
r ise to the name. 

Here  ‘so’  is  n atur a l ly  taken  as  referr in g  to  the  n ame  ‘Th e  Gi ant’  which  is  mentioned  in  the 
prev ious sentence;  it seems th at it can refer to any name that  is made contextu al l y s al ient (which 
is wh at we wou ld  expect of  a demonstrative).  Crimmins  and  Perry’s  ide a  is  that bel ief reports 
h ave  much  in  common  with  sentences  contain in g  ‘so-cal led ’;  however,  in  a  bel ief  report  the 
element  that  wou ld  do  the  work  of  ‘so -ca l led ’  is  u n a rticu l ated.  In  essence  (and  much 
s impl if ied), the proposal  is that a report of the form 

(4)  Ju d ith believes that Giorgione was a painter 

can be understood as expressin g the same proposition as is expressed by 

(5)  Ju d ith believes that Giorgione was a painter by means of that notion and th at 
ide a 

where the  notion  in  question  is  a  representation of the  ind ivid u a l G iorgione  and  the  ide a  is  a 
representation of the property of being  a painter.  This gives r ise to opacity in the fol lowing way. 
Suppose Ju d ith has two notions of the ind ivid u a l G iorgione, one of which  inclu des the feature 
that  he  is  cal led  ‘G iorgione’ whilst  the  other  inclu des  the  feature that  he  is  cal led  ‘B arb arel l i ’. 
Let  us  further  suppose  that  she  bel ieves  the  first  of  these  notions  (her  Giorg ione-notion)  to 
concern  an Ital i an  l andscape painter; and  that she bel ieves the second  (her Barbarelli-notion) to 
concern  an  En gl ish  cond uctor.  One  of  these  notions  w il l  be  denoted  by  the  expression  ‘th at 
notion ’ in (5).  Which one?  That w il l depend on which of them is made s al ient by the context; 
as w ith  ‘so-cal led ’  there  is  no  s imple ru le that determines  this.  However, aga in  par a l lel in g  the 
case of  ‘so-cal led ’,  a typical way of makin g  a  representation  s a l ient wil l  be by means  of the very 
words used  in the ascr iption.  So typical l y (5) w il l be used to ascr ibe to Ju d ith the bel ief that the 
person  denoted  by  her G iorgione-notion  h as  the property of being  a pa inter  (I  h ave  descr ibed 
this  bel ief meta- l in gu istical l y, but this  can  be  avoided).  Now we can  see  how this  gives  r ise to 
opacity.  Suppose  we  substituted  ‘B arbarel l i ’  for  ‘Giorgione’  in  (5).  The  n ame  wou ld  sti l l 
function  to  denote the  s ame  person.  However,  typica l l y  the  denotation  of  ‘that  notion ’  wou l d 
chan ge.  Rather  than  denoting  Ju d ith ’s  G iorgione-notion,  it  wil l  now  typical ly  denote  her 
B arbarel l i - notion.  For Cr immins and Perry the notions and  ide as are concrete particu l ars : the 
particu l ars th at make up beliefs.  But they cou ld think of them as more abstract.
