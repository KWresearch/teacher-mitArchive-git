VI  NAMING & NECESSITY, LECTURE TWO 

The Modal Argument 
If the descr iption g ives  the  meaning of a n ame, then it wil l be a necessar y truth th at the bearer of 
the n ame fits the descr iption. But  it isn ’t. Ar istotle might n ot have tau ght Alex ander the Great. 
Moving  to  the  cluster  theory  makes  no  d ifference:  Ar istotle  might  h ave  h ad  very  few  of  the 
properties for which he is famous. 

Perhaps the use of the descr iption  is to fix  the  re ference of the n ame. And maybe there are some 
cases  for which  this  is  true  ( ‘ Jack  the Ripper’).  But Kr ipke  has  a  battery of  arguments  aga inst 
the idea th at this is norma l case: 

The Epistemic Argument 
If  the  descr iption  f ixes  the reference of the  name then whoever  is competent with the  n ame wil l 
know  a  priori  th at  that  the  bearer  of  the  n ame  fits  the  descr iption  (or  f its  most  of  the 
descr iption).  But we don ’t know this a  priori, s ince there is somethin g th at we cou ld f ind out, a 
posteriori,  th at wou ld  make  us  den y  th at  they  f itted  the  descr iption. So  the knowledge  th at we 
h ave concern in g the bearer of the name is held a posteriori. 

The Semantic Argument 
Th is broadens the point made above.  Suppose it turned ou t that someone other th an the Gödel, 
Schmidt,  d id  the  thin gs  stand ard ly  attr ibuted  to  Gödel.  By  the  descr iption  theory,  ‘Gödel ’ 
wou ld  then  refer to Schmidt.  But  it wou ld n ’t;  ‘Gödel ’ wou ld  stil l  refer to Gödel  (w itness  how 
we  descr ibed  the  example).  Simil ar l y,  if  the  descr iption  appl ied  to  no  one,  ‘Gödel ’  wou ld  stil l 
refer to Gödel. 

The Paucity of Information Argument 
Very often we simply don ’t h ave enough bel iefs to un iquely identify an yone as the bearer of the 
n ame (Feynman/Gel l-M ann, p.81). 

Some Possible Responses by the Description Theorist 
(i ) Be carefu l about which descr iption you use: ‘The person cal led “Ar istotle”’; ‘The person who 
actu al l y taught Alex ander, etc.’;  ‘The person who  is widel y bel ieved  to have tau ght Alexander, 
etc.’’ Kr ipke has a var iety of responses here (pp. 87–91).

(i i) Hold th at n ames are descr iptions th at always take wid e scope. Kr ipke objects th at his cl aims 
apply equa l l y to names in s imple sentences (pp. 10–12). 

The Causal ‘Picture’ 
In  contrast  to  the  descr iption  theory  Kr ipke  offers  an  al tern ative  picture:  n ames  refer  to  the 
object they refer to in virtue of an  in iti al baptism, fol lowed by a caus a l ch a in  in which the n ame 
is  ‘passed  from  l ink  to  l ink ’.  E ach  person  who  learns  the  n ame  intends  to  use  it  to  refer  to 
whoever  the person  they  learn  it  from uses  it to  refer  to. The  account  is  fu nd amental ly  soci a l, 
u n l ike the descr iption theory (p. 91). Why does  Kr ipke in s ist th at this is  a pic ture not a theory? 
Is  it  just  to  avoid  refutation?  Or  to  avoid  mak in g  the  descr iption  theory  trivi a l l y  true  (see  n. 
38)?  Or is there some deeper reason?
