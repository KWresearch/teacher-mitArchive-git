Metaphysical Possibility and Epistemic Possibility 
A  statement  is  metaphys ica l l y  poss ible  iff  there  is  a  poss ible  world  in  which  it  is  true.  A 
statement  is  epistemica l l y  possible  iff  there  is  a  world  in  which,  as  f ar  as  our  exper iences  go, 
words  seem to be  used  the  same way,  but  in which  an  utterance of the  sentence that  expressed 
that statement wou ld express a true statement (that’s rough ; but the idea is th at there are worlds 
in  which  an  utterance  of  the  sentence  ‘Hesperus  is  Phosphorous ’  wou ld  express  a  truth). 
Although  identity  statements  involvin g  r igid  terms  are,  if  true, metaphys ical ly  necessar y  (i.e. 
their den i a l  is not metaphys ica l l y poss ible) they need not be epistemical l y necessary.  We often 
mark  our  talk  of  epistemic  poss ibil ity  by  the  locution  ‘It  might  h ave  turned  out  that  … ’ 
Apparent  counterexamples  to  the  necessity  of  identity  ar e  often  cases  of  epistemic  poss ibil ity. 
( ‘E l iz abeth II might h ave turned out to be the dau ghter of the Trumans.’) 

Natural Kind Terms 
Terms  l ike  ‘Gold ’  and  ‘Tiger ’ work  l ike proper  n ames.  They  are  r igid  des ign ators  (of kinds), 
and their reference is not fixed by descr iption but by somethin g  l ike ostention.  The descr iptions 
we  give  of  them  cou ld  be  rad ical l y  wrong.  Cf.  Putn am:  ‘Mean ings  a in ’t  in  the  head ’.  The 
H2O/XYZ ex ample.  The l in gu istic d ivis ion of labor.  The  index ica l element in n atur a l kin d 
terms. 

Non-Natural Kind Terms 
‘Yel low’:  a  term  whose  reference  is  f ixed  as  the  phys ical  property  that  g ives  r ise  to  the  visu a l 
impress ion  of  yel low.  (Contrast  with  a  pure  d isposition a l  view  on  which,  in  each  poss ible 
world, the yel low thin gs are those that look yel low.) 

The Argument for Dualism 
Contrast  identity  statements  th at  contain  r igid  n ames  ( ‘Hesperus  is  Phosphorous)  and  those 
that  contain  a  r igid  n ame  and  a  descr iption  ( ‘Benjamin  Frank l in  is  the  inventor  of bifocals ’). 
The  former  are  necessar y,  but  the  l atter  are  contin gent  (u n less  the  descr iption  h appens  to  be 
r igid ) ;  on  the  Russel l i an  approach,  they  are  not  even  central ly  identity  statements.  If  an 
identity statement is necessar y, then there wil l be no poss ible work in which the entity n amed by 
the term on  one  side  of  the  identity  h as  a property  that  is  not had  by  the entity  n amed  on  the 
other  s ide.  Accord in g  to  Kr ipke,  the  identity  theor ist  about  mental  states  wants  to  aff irm 
identities us in g r igid  n ames. There are two kinds.  The token-token theorist (pp. 145-8) wants 
to say th at each ind ivid u a l pain  is identica l w ith a particu l ar neur a l state; the type-type theorist 
(pp. 148–55) wants to make the stronger cl aim th at every mental  type is  identical w ith  a neur a l 
type  ( ‘P a in  is  identical  with  C-f iber  fir in gs ’).  Kr ipke  argues  that  both  fal l  to  the  same  bas ic 
worry:  there  are  possible worlds  in  which  the  neur al  type  l acks  the  property of  being  pa infu l ; 
whereas it is an essentia l property of pain that it is painfu l.
