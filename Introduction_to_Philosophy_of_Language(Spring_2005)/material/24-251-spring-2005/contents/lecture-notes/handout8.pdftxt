VIII	 STRAWSON & DONNELLAN ON REFERRING & 
DENOTING 

Strawson’s Distinctions 
(i )  a sentence (i.e. understood as a particu l ar strong of Engl ish terms) 
(i i)  a use of  a sentence (i.e. with  a l l  of  its  index ical  expressions—whether  impl icit or expl icit— 
ass igned a reference) 
(i ii ) an utterance of a sentence (i.e. some particu l ar concrete utterance). 

An a logous d istinctions are to be made for terms. 

Mean ings  attach to sentences and express ions.  They are akin to d irections for use.  But it is the 
use of a sentence that is either true or false, not a sentence itself ; and  it is the use of an express ion 
that either does or does not refer. 

Wh at h appens then in cases in which the use of a descr itption fai ls to denote?  The descr iption 
h as mean in g, which  is  given by the  descr iptive content.  But  in  us in g  the  descr iption  in  subject 
position, the speaker does not assert that the descr iption is instanti ated.  Rather she presupposes 
( ‘s ign a ls ’  ‘impl ies ’) that it is.  Where this presupposition is not met, the speaker’s utterance lacks 
a  truth  value.  (Or,  perhaps,  sometimes,  the  speaker  fai ls  to  say  an ythin g:  “Th is  is  a  f ine  red 
one”) 

How much does Strawson end up d is agreeing with Russel l? 

Donnellan 
Two d ifferent uses of descriptions : referenti al  and attributive. 

(i ) Attr ibutive use: Smith ’s murderer is ins ane =Whoever murdered Smith is ins ane 
Both Strawson ’s account and Russel l ’s account apply primar il y to this. 

(i i) Referenti al use: Smith ’s murderer is ins ane = He is ins ane.
