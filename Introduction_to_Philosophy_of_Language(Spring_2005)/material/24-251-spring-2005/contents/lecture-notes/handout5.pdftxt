V  NAMING & NECESSITY, LECTURE ONE 

The Frege-Russell view of ordinary names 
There  has  been  much  d iscuss ion  as  to  whether  Kr ipke  represented  the  views  of  Frege  an d 
Russel l accur ately.  We shan ’t review this.  It is enough to note th at the view he cr iticizes u nder 
this  he ad in g  has  been  w idely  held ;  and  that  it  is  u nclear  whether,  if  the  views  of  Frege  do 
d iverge, they can escape his criticisms. 

The  Frege-Russel l  theory:  the  referent  of  a  n ame  is  wh atever  is  denoted  by  the  defin ite 
descr iption associ ated with it. 

The cluster theory (W ittgenstein ; Sear le): the referent of a n ame is wh atever is denoted by most 
or enough of the cluster of defin ite descr iptions associ ated with it. (31) 

Some advantages of both the Frege-Russel l account and the cluster account:

it  explains  how  n ames  can  refer  to  thin gs,  and  in  particu l ar,  how  they  can  refer  to 
thin gs with which we are not acqua inted. (27-8) 
it explains how identity statements can be informative (28); 
it expl ains how an ex istenti al cl a im can be informative, and how it can be poss ibly fa lse 
(28) 

To  understand  a  n ame  is  to  gr asp  the  descr iption  (cluster  of  descr iptions)  th at  is  ( are) 
associ ated with it.  So someone who is competent with a n ame wil l know a  priori th at the bearer 
of the name (if there is one) fits the description (most of the descr iptions). (64) 

W i l l  someone who  understand  the  name  also  think  that the cl aim th at the bearer of the n ame 
(if  there  is  one)  f its  the  descr iption  is  necessary?  Th at  depends  on  whether  the  descr iption 
(cluster of descr iptions) is ( are) being used to give the mean in g of the n ame, or to fix its referent. 
To see wh at this means,  and wh at  is  at  issue here we need  to get clearer on wh at  is meant by  ‘ a 
prior i ’ and  ‘necessar y’. 

A priori 
At  base  an  epistemic  notion :  a  sentence  is  a  priori  iff  it  cou ld  be  known  independently  of 
experience. (Note: it cou ld  in fact be known a posteriori thou gh) 

Necessary 
At base a metaphys ica l notion : a sentence is necessar y iff it is true in every poss ible world. Some 
people  have  cl aimed  th at  necess ity  is  rel ative  to  (and  is  an  artifact  of)  l an gu age.  As  it  is 
sometimes  said :  al l  necess ity  is  de  d ic to:  ‘It’s  on ly  a  statement  or  a  state  of  affairs  th at  can  be

either  necessar y or contin gent! Whether  a particu l ar  necess ar i l y or contin gently  h as  a  certai n 
property  depends  on  how  it  is  descr ibed ’  (40).  (Qu ine,  in  so  far  as  he  accepts  necess ity  at  al l, 
says  somethin g  alon g  these  l ines.) Kr ipke  is r ad ica l l y opposed  to this.  (Note the cla ims  in  the 
par agr aph  on  p.  40,  from  which  the  above  quotation  is  taken,  are  put  in  the  mouth  of  some 
imag ined  opponent;  Kr ipke  is  not  endors in g  these  cl aims.)  He  thinks  th at  there  are  man y 
necessar i l y true sentences th at are true independently of l an gu age. They  are necessar y de  re. In 
particu l ar :  he  thinks  th at ord in ar y  n ames  are  rig id  designators,  in  the  sense that  they pick  out 
the  same thin g  in  every poss ible world  in  which  they pick out  anythin g.  But then  an  identity 
sentence,  a=b,  contain in g  two  rig id  des ign ators  w il l  be  necessar i l y  true.  One  source  of  the 
suspicion of de  re necess ity comes, Kr ipke suggests,  from a  confus ion  about the role of poss ible 
worlds  in understand in g necess ity. (42–8) 

Analytic 
Kr ipke  doesn ’t  give  a  fu l l  account.  He  says  that  he  wil l  u nderstand  an a l ytic  sentences  to  be 
those that  are  true  in  virtue of mean in g,  and  true  in  virtue of mean in g  in  every poss ible world 
( ‘Th at ’s sort of stipu l ative’) (39) 

Sentences that are necessary but not a priori 
Man y identity sentences concern in g phys ical objects.

True mathematical  statements  that  l ack proofs (perhaps :  ‘Every even  number  greater  than  2  is

the sum of two primes’ — Goldbach ’s conjecture).


Sentences that are a priori but not necessary 
The meter  stick  is  one meter  long.  (The meter  stick  is  used  to  fix  the  reference of  the term  ‘one

meter’)

I am here now.

The actu a l F is F (The actu al  inventor of the zipper is the inventor of the zipper)


So, if a theory cl aims s imply that the description is used to fix the reference of the n ame, speakers

wil l not need to think that it is a necessar y truth th at the bearer of the name fits the descr iption.
