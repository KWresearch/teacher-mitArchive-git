X  PRESUPPOSITION AND EMPTY NAMES 

Non-Catastrophic Presupposition Failure 
Frege  and early-Strawson argued  that sentences contain ing terms (names or descr iptions) that 
fail  to  refer  lack  tru th-values. Russell  thought that those containing non-denoting descriptions 
are  false.  But  even  those  who  embrace  the  Frege/Strawson  line  have  to  concede  that  there 
seem  to  be  a  class  of  sentences  with  non-denoting  descriptions  that  are  simply  false;  and 
moreover  in  some  way  their  falsity  doesn’t  stem  d irectly  from  the  fact  that  they  contain  non-
denoting terms.  Contrast: 

(1) The King of France is bald 

(2) My fr iend went for a drive last week w ith the King of France 

Following  Yablo,  call  cases  l ike  (2)  case  of  ‘non-catastrophic  presupposition  failure’;  it  is  non-
catastrophic in the sense that it doesn’t wreck the commun icative  intent of the speaker. 

Three tests 
Traditionally,  the  test  for  presuppos ition  is  lack  of  truth-value  if  it  is  not  met.  But  that  test 
begs  the  question  against  the  phenomenon  we  are  considering  here.  So  we  need  some  other 
tests : 

Sentence: ‘I’m picking my guru up at the airport’; Presupposition : ‘I have a guru’; tests : 
(i)  ‘Hey, wait a minute, I didn’t know that you had a guru’; 
(ii) what  is  den ied,  hoped,  regretted  etc:  ‘I  hope  I ’ll  pick  my guru  up  at  the  airport’  doesn’t 
entail ‘I hope I have a guru’; 
(iii) pro jection : ‘I don ’t have to pick up my guru after all’ still entails  ‘I have a guru’. 

We  might  think  that  our  intu itions  about  the  truth  and  falsity  of  certain  sentences  are  direct 
evidence  for  their  truth  or  falsity. Or we might  think  that  our  intuitions  are  too  unreliable  for 
that. Nevertheless  they need  some  explanation;  we  need  some  explanation  of what  von  Fintel 
cal ls  ‘a pragmatics of  assent  and  rejection’. When we talk  about  truth  and  fals ity from now on , 
we’ll mean it  in this weak sense, not assuming that this is ‘deep’ tru th and falsity. 

Topic 
One poss ibil ity: the difference between (1) and (2)  is that in the  former ‘The King of France’ is 
in  topic  position  (it  is what  the  sentence  is  about), whereas  in  the  latter  ‘My  friend’  is  in  topic 
position. Maybe only non-deno ting descriptions  in  topic position  give r ise  to  tru th-value  gaps . 
But consider : 

(3) The King of France is s itting in that chair

Von Fintel 
Intuitive  idea:  a  sentence  with  a  false  presuppos ition  is  false  if  we  would  judge  it  false  even  if 
we  came  to  bel ieve  that  the  presuppos ition were  true.  (NB  this  isn’t  the  same  as  saying  that  it 
would be  false even  if  the presuppos ition were true: maybe that  chair  is  the French Throne, so 
if  the  King  of  France  d id  exist,  that  is  just  where  he’d  be  sitting.)  More  precisely:  consider  a 
sentence S with a presupposition π . Suppose that the speaker is speaking against a background 
of  information  D,  according  to  which  π  is  false.  In  determin ing  the  truth  value  of  S,  we  f irst 
revise  D,  and  then  we  see  whether  D  would  entail  the  falsehood  of  S.  Von  Fintel  cons iders 
four proposals for how to do the revis ion: 

(i)	

remove not-π from D 
remove any proposition from D that is logically incompatible with π 
add π to D 
close under logical consequence 

Problem:  suppose  I  have  examined  all  of  the  existing  kings,  and  have  concluded  that  they  are 
all not-bald.  So D contains ‘All kings are not bald’.  Then  (1) would come out false. 

(ii)	

remove not-π from D 
remove any proposition from D that is logically incompatible with π 
remove any proposition from D that was in D just because not-π was  in D 
add π to D 
close under logical consequence 

Problem:  ‘The King of France  is on  a state visit to Austral ia this week ’ is  typically judged  false. 
But having  removed  so  much  from D,  I  have  no thing  left  there  that  rules  it  false.  So we  have 
to  restr ict the  set of  things  that we took ou t of D : von  Fintel’s  proposal  is  to  leave  in  the  set o f 
judgments that we could get by cons idering some salient (existing) entities : 

(iii)	

remove not-π from D 
remove any proposition from D that is logically incompatible with π 
remove  any  proposition  from D  that  was  in  D  just  because  not-π was  in  D,  unless  it 
could  be  shown  to  be  true  by  examining  the  [intr insic]  properties  of  a  contex tually 
salient entity 
add π to D 
close under logical consequence 

Nice  consequence:  ‘The King of  France  is  one  of  the  bald  people  in  this world’ now  gets  ruled 
false, s ince this makes the class of bald people in this world  into a sal ient entity. 

Problem:  why  couldn’t we  now  show  that  (1)  is  false,  by  examin ing  France,  and  showing  that 
it is true that it has no king.  So, mod ify again:

(iv)	

remove not-π from D 
remove any proposition from D that is logically incompatible with π 
remove  any  proposition  from D  that  was  in  D  just  because  not-π was  in  D,  unless  it 
could  be  shown  to  be  true  by  examining  the  [intr insic]  properties  of  a  contex tually 
salient entity w ithout at the same time show ing that π is false. 
add π to D 
close under logical consequence 

Yablo 
Don’t  try  just  to  capture  the  false  sentences with non-denoting descriptions.  Try  to  explain  a 
host  of  d ifferent  sentences  that we  take  to  be  false  or  true  despite  failing  presuppositions  (e.g. 
the Donnellan sentences).  But focus just on the false: 

A  The lodger next door offered me twice that sum—False (there is no lodger next door)

B  The au thor of Pr incipia Mathematica also wrote Pr incipia Ethica—False

C  All  ten solar planets are  inhabited—False

D  The man drinking a martini is a philosopher—False (the man  in question is an engineer)

E  My cousin is not a boy any more—False (my female cousin is eight years old)


Bas ic  idea:  what  is  true  or  false  is  that  which  is  said  in  addition  to  the  presuppos ition.  Or  in 
other  words,  in  evaluating  what  is  true  or  false  in  a  sentence  S  independently  of  the 
presupposition π, think what would have to be added  to the presupposition to entail S. 

So if the presuppositions are 

A  There is exactly one lodger nex t door

B There is exactly one author of Principia Mathematica

C There are exactly ten solar planets

D  That man (Dan iels) is the man drink ing a martini

E  My cousin is a male human being


The asserted contents are: 

A  Some and all lodgers nex t door offered me tw ice that sum

B  Some and all Pr incipia Mathematica au thors also wro te Principia Ethica

C  All solar planets are inhabited

D  That man (Dan iels) is a philosopher

E  My cousin is an adult.


All of these are false.  Might we say then  that we judge a sentence S w ith a false presupposition 
π to be false just in case its asserted content  is false; and we judge  it true just in case  its asserted

content  is  true?  That would  be  too  quick,  s ince  then  it  seems  that  every  such  sentence would 
be  either  true  or  false:  in  arguing  that  there  is  non-catastrophic  presuppositional  failure,  we 
seem  to  have  reached  the  conclus ion  that  there  is  no  catastrophic  presuppos ition  failure.  Yet 
our starting po int was  that there is:  it is what is exhibited in (1). 

Yablo’s  response  is  to  do  things  in  two  stages .  A  sentence  S  makes  a  claim  just  in  case,  if  its 
asserted  content  is  true,  then  the  asserted  content  of  ~S  is  false.  Otherw ise  it  fails  to  make  a 
claim.  Statements  that fail  to make  a  claim  suffer  catastrophic presuppos ition  failure.  That  is 
what  happens  to  (1):  its  asserted  content  is:  ‘Any  French  Kings  are  bald ’;  and  the  asserted 
content  of  its  (narrow  scope) negation  is :  ‘Any French Kings  are  no t-bald’. But  those  are  both 
true.  So (1) is neither true nor false. 

In  contrast,  sentences  that do  make  a  claim will  be  judged  true  or  false  depending on whether 
their  asserted  content  is  true  or  false.  Or  more  precisely,  since  there might  be more  than  one 
sentence  that  could  serve  the  role  of  asserted  contented,  depending  on  whether  the 
conjunction  of  asserted  contents  are  true  or  false.  (That ’s  not  quite  the  terminology  that 
Yablo uses : he calls  the con junction  the asserted content, and calls  the con juncts  from which  it 
is constructed the π–free ex tens ions; but the idea should be reasonably clear.)
