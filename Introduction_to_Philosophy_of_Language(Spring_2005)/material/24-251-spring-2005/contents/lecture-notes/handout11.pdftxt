INDEXICALS & DE SE ATTITUDES 

Propositions and Indexicals 
So  far we  have  treated  the  objects  of  belief  and  assertion  as  propositions;  and we  have  treated 
indexicals  as  though  they  were  singular  terms  like  any  other.  But  consider  the  difference 
between: 
(1) I am in a mess 

And 

(2) NN is in a mess 
Where  ‘NN’  is  a name  for  you.  It  seems  that one  can  believe  either of  these without believing 
the other.  So, on a Fregean doctrine, we must take ‘NN’ and ‘I’ to have d ifferent senses.  What 
is  the  sense  of  the  latter?  Any  description  that  we  try  to  put  in  that  doesn’t  itself  contain  an 
indexical  will  no t  do  the  job.  Indeed  it  is  unclear  that  there  is  any  concept  that  we  have  that 
corresponds  to  ‘I ’.  (This  is  clearer  if  we  consider  ‘now ’.)  But  if  we  cannot  come  up  w ith  a 
sense  for  the  indexical,  how  are  we  to  understand  the  proposition  in  which  is  supposedly 
appears? 

In general: No amount of bel ief  abou t the world w ill enable one to  locate oneself  in  the world . 
(Lingens ;  the  two Gods.) But  if  propos itions  are ways  of  descr ibing  the world  (this  comes  out 
most  clear ly  if  one  understand  them  as  classes  of  possible  worlds),  then  no  self-locating  bel ief 
will  be  a  propos ition.  In  Lewis’s  terminology,  the  de  se  (the  self-locating)  does  no t  reduce  to 
the  de  d icto.  This  applies  equally  to  other  attitudes  than  belief  (e.g.  desire);  and  to  temporal 
location as well as spatial (the insomn iac;  ‘Thank goodness  that’s over ’). 

De Re 
Does  it help if we move  to de re bel ief ascr iptions?  No: one can still have a belief  about oneself 
(understood de re) that one is  in a mess, without believing (1). 

Limited Access 
This is Frege ’s own solution. ‘Everyone is presented to himself  in a special and pr imitive way in 
which he  is presented  to no-one else’ (‘The Thought’,  p. 359) What does  it mean? How do we 
manage  to  communicate? How  do we  make  sense  of  what  two  people,  each  of  whom  bel ieves 
(1), have in common? 

Lewis 
Take the basic form of  a belief ascription  to be the self-ascription of a property.  Al l beliefs are 
thus de se. De dicto is a special case of de se, where what one self-ascribes is world membership.

Note  that  there  are  two  moves  here:  first  Lewis  takes  the  pr imitive  relation  to  be  self-
ascription. So  there  is no need  to get the de se element  into  the  content of  the attitude; rather  it 
goes  into  the  attitude  itself  (i.e.  the  attitude  that  is  the  attitude  to  the  content). Second, Lew is 
takes the contents of the attitudes  to be properties rather than propositions . 

Most of Lewis’s discuss ion focuses on the second of these two moves. Perhaps this was because 
he was already assuming the first  in his account of de re belief (one self-ascribes membership of 
a  world;  to  see  the  significance  of  this ,  imagine  coming  up  with  a  vers ion  of  the  two  gods 
example  in  which  the  gods  don’t  even  know  which  world  they  are  in).  But  the  f irst  is  equally 
sign ificant.  It  is  very  d ifferent  to  the  Fregean  approach,  which  doesn’t  think  of  bel ief  as  any 
kind of self-ascr iption . 

Perhaps  we  can  leave  self-ascr iption  as  pr imitive ,  but  it  would  be  good  to  know  a  bit  more 
about  it.  In  particular,  what  is  the  relation  between  self-ascription  of  a  property  and  the 
ascription of that property to a particular physical or mental entity? Is self-ascribing a property 
p the same  as  thinking  ‘I  am p’. If so, what  is  it  that  is denoted by  ‘I ’? Do we have  independent 
access to it, or is it, so to speak,  the shadow of the self-ascriptions?
