XV  LANGTON: UNSPEAKABLE ACTS 

Background: MacKinnon’s claim that pornography is subordination, and  that it is s ilencing. 

Subordination 
Subordination  may  be  a  perlocutionary  act:  by  mak ing  various  judgments  or  rulings  certain 
people  may  come  to  be  subordinate.  But  might  it  also  be  an  illocutionary  act?  Certainly  we 
have  no  formulation  ‘I  hereby  subordinate ’.  But  then  there  are  other  clearly  illocu tionary  acts 
that have no  correspond ing form of words ( ‘I hereby threaten  you’?)  Langton  argues  that  it  is. 
She  classes  it  with  other  verd ictives  ( ‘Fault! ’)  and  exercitives  (orderings,  authorizings  etc.):  it 
ranks  women  and  legitimates  certain  behavior  towards  them.  A  crucial  issue  here:  what 
authority does pornography have? 

Compare pornography with advertizing. 

Silencing 
Silencing  again may be  locu tionary (a gag), or  perlocutionary (no one  listens).  Bu t might  it be 
illocutionary?  Certain  words  s imply  might  no t  count  For  instance,  blacks  in  apartheid  Sou th 
Africa;  the  participants  in  a  gay  marriage  ceremony  in  a  state  in  which  gay  marr iage  is  not 
allowed ; a woman saying ‘no’ to unwanted sex. 

Presuppositional Accommodation 
Accommodation seems  to be a device whereby claims go into the background  in order to make 
sense of what  is said. Is  it more effective that straight out assertion? The boot example. People 
misunderstanding  their  own  responses.  Is  this  pecul iar  to  sexual  responses?  Cons ider 
advertizing again. 

Truth in Fiction 
We  take  from  fiction  var ious  lessons  about  how  things  actually  are.  What k ind  of  things  can 
be  fals ified  in  fiction?  Laws  of  physics  seem  more  eas ily  broken  that  rules  of  morality.  Does 
that mean  that,  if  there  is an  implicit moral stance  in  a piece of  literature, we are more  likely to 
see it as endorsed by the writer?
