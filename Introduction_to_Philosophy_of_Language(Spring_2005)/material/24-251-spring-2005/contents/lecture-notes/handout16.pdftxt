Philosophy of
Language 

XVI  LEWIS: LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES 

Wh at  is  the  relation  of  a  l an gu age  u nderstood  as  a  formal  ch ar acteriz ation,  and  l an gu age 
u nderstood  as  a  certain  soci al  phenomenon?  Or  to put the  point  in  another way :  in  virtue of 
wh at  is  it  correct  to  use  a  certain  abstract  object  ( a  formal  l an gu age)  to  ch ar acterize  the 
l in gu istic  behavior  of  a  certain  popu l ation?  Lewis ’s  idea  is  th at  a  l an gu age  is  used  by  a 
popu l ation  iff  there  is  a  convention  to  use th at  l an gu age;  and  a  convention  to  use  it  is  in  turn 
spel led out as  a convention to do certain  thin gs w ith  it. Bu t before explorin g wh at those thin g s 
are, we need to have some take on the idea of a convention. 

Conventions  (rough  an a l ys is) :  regu l ar ities  to  which  people  conform  because  their 
belief that others conform gives them pragmatic reason to conform. 

Conventions (more precise an a l ys is) regu l ar ities to which people conform because their 
belief th at others conform gives them pragmatic reason to conform, and where: (i) there 
must be other regu l ar ities  that cou ld  do  the  job (or else the regu l ar ity  th at  is  fol lowed 
wou ld  be  forced  upon  the people  involved, rather  th an  bein g  fol lowed  as  convention ) ; 
(i i)  the  people must  h ave  a  genera l  preference  th at  others  conform  (or  else  we wou l d 
h ave  dead locked  conf l ict),  and  (i ii )  al l  of  these  facts  must  be  mutu a l  knowledge 
amongst those involved. 

A  g iven  l an gu age  L  (u nderstood  formal l y)  can  then  be  sa id  to  be  used  by  a  popu l ation  of 
speakers ( a concrete group of people), just in case there is a convention of truthfulness and trust in 
L:  truthfulness,  in  that  the  speakers  utter on ly  true  sentences of L;  and  trust in  that  they bel ieve 
others to be truthfu l  in L, and  so come to believe wh at they say. And  s ince the formal semantics 
work  in  terms  of  truth  cond itions,  it  is  a  straightforward  matter  to  see wh at  it wou ld  be  for  a 
sentence to be true. The formal is connected to the social. 

Does  this  account  fu l l y  determine  the  l an gu age  th at  is  used  by  a  popu l ation?  There  are  two 
issues  here.  First, knowing  th at there is  a convention of truthfu lness  and  trust to use  a certain 
l an gu age  leaves  open  the  mechan isms  by  which  the  interpretation  of  th at  l an gu age  is  f ixed. 
T ake the relation of n ames to their bearers. It cou ld be, for instance, th at we h ad  a convention of 
us in g  a Lagadon i an  l an gu age  in which objects n ame themselves, and  so are related by identity. 
Or  it  cou ld  be  th at  we  use  a  l an gu age  in  which  n ames  are  rel ated  to  their  bearers  by  caus a l 
cha ins ; or one  in which  they  are  rel ated by descr iptions. We  need  to know how thin gs  are  for 
En gl ish,  and  for  the other  n atur al  l an gu ages  in  which  we  are  interested. These  are the  issues 
that we h ave been d iscuss in g up til l  now : whether Frege’s theory of name is correct etc. Second, 
there  is  the  issue  of  whether,  even  given  this  information,  the  l an gu age  is  fu l l y  determined : 
whether  there  is  semantic  indetermin acy,  perh aps  of  the  innocuous  kind  in  which  our 
conventions  s imply  do  not fix whether some particu l ar word  is properly  ass igned  one sense or 
another ; or of a more systematic and d isturbin g k ind, for instance as d iscussed by Qu ine, or by 
Goodman  and by W ittgenstein, as  interpreted by Kr ipke.  We ’l l  return  to this  issue  at the end 
of the course.
