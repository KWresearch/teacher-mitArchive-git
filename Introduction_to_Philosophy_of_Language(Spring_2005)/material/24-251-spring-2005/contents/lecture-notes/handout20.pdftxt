XX  TRUTH: THE LIAR 

Disquotational accounts of truth 
Frege  held  that,  for every  sentence  p,  p  is  equ ivalent  to  the sentence  ‘p’  is  true.  Frege  also  held 
that  truth  is  a  pr imitive  and  indefin able  notion.  But man y  Twentieth  Century  philosophers 
h ave contended that Frege shou ld h ave  pushed his bas ic ins ight further : th at one understand s 
a l l that there is to know about truth once one understands  that equ iva lence.  We sh a l l cons ider 
that idea further on Thursd ay. But f irst we sh al l cons ider another problem: the par adox of the 
l i ar. 

Paradox of the Liar 
Distingu ish  the  truth  operator  It  is  true  that  (tak in g  sentences  to  sentences)  from  the  truth 
pred icate is true (tak ing n ames to sentences).  The l i ar is a problem for the latter: 

The stand ard  l i ar : 
Th is sentence is false 

The strengthened l i ar : 
Th is sentence is not true 

‘Contin gent ’ l i ars : 
Father : Everythin g your mother says is true 
Mother : Everythin g your father says is false 

Jones : Most of Nixon ’s assertions about Watergate are false

N ixon : Everythin g th at Jones said about Watergate is true


The strengthened l i ar shows th at the problem cannot be escaped by moving to a den i a l of truth. 

The  problem  ar ises  if  the  l an gu age  can  ach ieve  self-reference,  and  if  the  l an gu age  is 
semantical l y  closed,  i.e.  if  there  is  a  truth  pred icate  which  can  be  appl ied  to  the  n ame  of  an y 
sentence of the l an gu age to form a sentence that itself receives a truth-va lue. (Actu al l y even self-
reference isn ’t needed ; cons ider Yablo’s par adox  in which  each premise in  an  inf in ite sequence 
of premises says th at al l the premises after it are false.) 

Tarski 
B as ic idea : in pl ace of a s ing le lan gu age contain ing  its own truth pred icate, think of a hier archy 
of  l an gu ages,  each  of  which  contains  a  truth  pred icate  th at  appl ies  to  express ions  in  the 
l an gu ages below it in the hierarchy, but not to itself.  (T arski was actua l l y skeptical about do ing 
this  for  En gl ish,  which  he  took  to  be  simply  contrad ictory.  Qu ine  was  more  optimistic.)  The 
Liar wil l now be simply un gr ammatical.

Kripke 
B as ic  idea :  think of  the truth pred icate  as  a parti a l l y  def ined  pred icate,  i.e. one th at  is  def ined 
for  some  sentences  and  not  for  others.  Start with  the  sentences  th at  do  not  contain  any  truth 
pred icate.  Ass ign  each  of  them  to  class  of  true  or  false.  Now  see  which  of  the  remain in g 
sentences  h ave their  truth values  determined  as  a  resu lt of this  ass ignment:  ass ign  them to the 
cl ass  of  the  true  or  of  the  false  accord in g ly.  Now  apply  this  procedure  aga in.  Continue 
applyin g  it until each  appl ication resu lts  in  no more sentences being  ass igned  to either the true 
or the false.  The Li ar w il l not have been ass igned to either the true or the false; it is, in Kr ipke’s 
termino logy, un grounded.  Simil ar l y un grounded  is the Truthtel ler : 

Th is sentence is true. 

Priest 
Simply  embrace  the  contrad iction.  (Bo ld )  But  we  now  need  to  block  the  idea  th at  from  a 
contrad iction everythin g fol lows.
