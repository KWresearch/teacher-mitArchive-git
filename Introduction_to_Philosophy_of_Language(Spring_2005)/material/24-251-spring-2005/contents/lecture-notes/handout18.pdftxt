XVIII  PROPOSITIONAL ATTITUDES: KRIPKE 

Millian v. Fregean Accounts 
Accord ing  to  the  M il l i an  account,  the  semantic  value  of  a  n ame  is  just  its  referent,  and  so 
substitution  of  coreferenti al  terms  wou ld  maint ain  not  just  truth  value  but  also  mean in g.  In 
Naming  and  Necessity Kr ipke  suggested  a M il l i an  accoun t of  names  th at  occur  in  extens ion a l 
contexts  and  w ithin  mod al  operators.  (Note  that  some—e.g. M ich ael  Devitt—held  him  to  be 
proposin g  a  caus a l  account,  accord in g  to which  the caus a l  ch a in  is  part of the mean in g of  the 
n ame:  same  referent  +  d ifferent  caus a l  ch a in  =  d ifferent  mean in g ;  Kr ipke’s  comments  here 
suggest  that  that  interpretation  is  mistaken).  But  Kr ipke  himself  seemed  to  reject Mil l i an ism 
about  n ames  in  proposition al  attitude  contexts:  he  held  th at  Hesperus  is  Hesperus  can  be 
known  a  priori,  but  Hesperus  is  Phosphorous  cannot;  th at  surely  entails  that  knowin g  th at 
Hesperus  is Hesperus  is  not the  s ame  as  knowing  the Hesperus  is  Phosphorous ;  and  so  that 
n ames are not Mil l i an within knowledge ascr iptions. 

Th at might su ggest th at the Fregean theory is correct for proposition al  attitude contexts, even if 
it  is  wrong  elsewhere.  But  as  Kr ipke  points  out,  there  are  d iff icu lties  in  think ing  th at  it  wil l 
solve al l of our problems 

(i )  Do  we  go  for  commun ity  w ide  senses  or  id io lectic  senses?  The  former  don ’t  seem  fine 
gr a ined enough; the l atter give r ise to al l kinds of problem ( ‘Everyone knows th at Ar istotle was 
a philosopher ’) 

(i i) Iterated attitudes seem to provide substitution problems even for synon yms :

Assumption :  ‘attorney’  is  synonymous  w ith  ‘l awyer ’  (if  you  doubt  that,  substitute  two  terms

that you do think are synon ymous).  Then contrast:


Whoever believes that attorneys are wealthy bel ieves that attorneys are wealthy 
Whoever believes that attorneys are wealthy bel ieves that l awyers are wealthy 

Mar y doubts th at whoever believes the attorneys are wealthy bel ieves that attorneys are wealthy 
Mar y doubts th at whoever believes the attorneys are wealthy bel ieves that lawyers are wealthy 

However, Kr ipke isn ’t tryin g to refute the Fregean  account d irectly.  Rather he is trying to show 
that  problems  about  bel ief  ( and—or?— about  bel ief  ascr iption)  ar ise  without  invoking  an y 
M il l i an  pr inciple of substitution. The  upshot  is  th at puzz les  about belief cannot by themselves 
be used aga inst the M il l i an  account; or at least, not until we find out just wh at is generatin g the 
puzz le in each case. 

Pierre 
D isquotation princ iple, D : If a norma l En gl ish speaker, on reflection, sincerely assents to ‘p’, then 
he believes that p.

Strengthened  d isquotation  princ iple,  SD :  A  normal  En g l ish  speaker  who  is  not  reticent  wil l  be 
d isposed to sincere reflective assent to ‘p’ if and on ly if he bel ieves that p. 

Translation  princ iple,  T : If a  sentence of one l an gu age expressed  a truth  in  th at  l an gu age, then 
an y trans l ation of it into an y other l angu age also expressed a truth (in that other lan gu age). 

B y D and T, (i) Pierre believes that London is pretty and bel ieves that London is not pretty.

B y  SD  and  T,  (ii )  Pierre  bel ieves  th at  London  is  pretty  and  does  not  bel ief  that  London  is

pretty.


Some responses : 
(i )  is  f alse  because  Pierre  doesn ’t  real l y  u nderstand  ‘London ’  (or  ‘Londres ’);  but  then  nor  do 
very man y other speakers.  (We risk rais in g the stand ard so high th at man y don ’t fal l under it). 
Simil ar problems ar ise if we accept that he knew wh at the terms meant, but deny that he had the 
relevant bel iefs. (Thou gh might we deny th at he bel ieves both?  Compare what we’d s ay  about a 
recogn ition al capacity.) 

(i )  is true, since Pierre believes a contrad iction.  But there is no logical mistake that he makes. 

(i )  is  fa lse  because  ‘London ’  isn ’t  real l y  a  trans l ation  of  ‘Londres ’  (A ga in  we  risk  ra is in g  the 
stand ard too high, and mak in g the trans l ation principle trivia l.) 

Peter 
Now  we  don ’t  even  need  the  trans l ation  pr inciple  (or  at  least,  al l  we  need  is  a  homophon ic 
trans l ation principle). 

Naïve Theorist 
Na ïve  theorists  (most  notably  Nathan  S almon  and  Scott  Soames)  conclu de  that  n ames  are 
M il l i an  even  w ithin  bel ief  contexts.  They  expla in  the  apparent  un acceptabil ity  of  man y 
coreferenti a l substitutions by means of pragmatic ru les on wh at a good ascr iption wou ld be l ike 
(bas ical l y:  keep  the  words  as  close  to  the  orig in a l  as  you  can );  devi atin g  from  these  ru les  by 
makin g  u nw arr anted  substitutions  gives  r ise  to  ascr iptions  that  are  strictly  true,  but 
pragmatical l y un acceptable. 

Presupposition 
Shou ld we be  able to  ‘answer  the origin a l  question ’  as  Kr ipke  ins ists?  Compare someone who 
ins isted  to  an  innocent:  ‘Have  you  stopped beatin g  your  wife or  not?  Yes or No?  Answer  the 
question!”  If  that  is  the  correct d i agnos is, what  are  the presuppositions  of our  bel ief  ascr ibin g 
practice?
