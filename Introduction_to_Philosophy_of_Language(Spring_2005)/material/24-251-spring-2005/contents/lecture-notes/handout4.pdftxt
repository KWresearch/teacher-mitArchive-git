IV  QUINE’S TWO DOGMAS 

Overview 
Sections I – IV: Looking for a reductive account of the an a l ytic synthetic d ivide (the existence of 
which  is the F irst Dogma), and fa il in g to find one.  The best th at can be given is a tight circle of 
interdefin itions involvin g an a l yticity, mean ing, synonymy, substitutabil ity, necessity. 

Section  V :  Rejecting  the  Second  Dogma,  that  every  mean in gfu l  (synthetic?)  statement  is 
reducible to experience. 

Section VI: Sketchin g an empir icist altern ative. 

Section I 
An an a l ytic statement is true in virtue of its mean in g.

Wh at is mean in g ?

Distingu ish mean in g from extens ion for both terms and pred icates

[Digress ion on essence]

Make do with sameness of mean in g, rather than tryin g to identify mean ings themselves.

Distingu ish  logica l l y  true  statements  ( ‘E ither  Harry  is  a  bachelor  or  it  is  not  the  case  that

Harry  is  a  bachelor ’)  from  those  that  are  an a l ytic  but  not  logica l l y  true  ( ‘B achelors  are

u nmarr ied ’ ).

The l atter class pose the problem.


Section II 
Perhaps we can turn a l l  an a l ytic statement into logica l truths by defin ition. 
But who gives the defin itions?  Not the lex icographers : they merely report them. So there h ave to 
be preexistin g  synonymy  relations  for  them to report on.  (Un important class  for which  this  i s 
not true: stipu l ative defin itions) 

Section III 
Perhaps two terms are synon ymous iff they can be interch an ged in a l l contexts salva veritate. 
But  is this suff icient for synonymy? Mere sameness of extens ion  is not sufficient: creature with 
a  he art and creature with kid neys h ave the s ame extens ion .  But  in order to h ave a test to dr aw 
these apart we need to cons ider sentences l ike 
Necessar il y a l l creatures with a heart are creatures with a kid ney 
But  that  is  just  tantamount  to  the  cl a im  th at  ‘Al l  creatures  with  a  heart  are  creatures  w ith  a 
kidney’ is an a l ytic.

Section IV 
Cou ld  we  define  an a l yticity  in  terms  of  logical  ru les?  Th at  is  ok  for  an  artif ici a l  formal 
l an gu age.  But it doesn ’t help with n atur al  l an gu age? No. 

Genera l  worry  about  Qu ine ’s  approach  so  far :  why  does  our  in abil ity  to  give  an  an a l ytic 
reduction  of  a  concept  show  that  it  is  somehow  il legitimate?  (Compare  knowledge)  Does 
Qu ine have some independent reason for think in g th at the notion of the an a l ytic is worr isome? 

Some  hint  is  g iven  from  the  passage  at  the  end  of  Section  IV.  There  Qu ine  concedes  th at 
whether  a  g iven  statement  is  true  is  a  function  both  of  what  its  words  mean  and  of  how  the 
world  is. However, he asks whether these two contributions can be neatly d ivided.  If they cou ld, 
we cou ld  identify  the cl ass  of sentences  for which  the contr ibution of  the world was  zero;  an d 
these  wou ld  be  an a l ytic.  So  this  throws  doubt  on  the  supposition  th at  we  can  d ivide  the 
contr ibution of mean in g from the contr ibution of the world. 

Section V 
Rad ical reduction ism (the Second Dogma ) 
Word vers ion : every word must correspond to an experience 
Sentence  version :  every  sentence  must  be  reducible  to  an  experience  (or  set  of 
experiences which wou ld verify it, and a set that wou ld confirm it. 

Problem: 

Ou r  statements  about  the  external  wo rld  face  the  tribunal  of  sen se  experience  not 
individually but only as a co rpo rate body. (57) 

For example: what experience wou ld verify the sentence tha t there are centaurs (r ather than th at 
we are ha l lucin atin g ) ?  Compare Hume on mir acles. 

There  is  no  d ivid in g of the  factu al  and  l ingu istic component  in  an y one sentence.  At best the 
d istinction needs to be drawn for the whole of science. 

Section VI 
The web of bel ief: a network of cl aims, some of which we are more l ikely to revise in response to 
evidence than others, but al l of which cou ld be revised  (except perh aps the un important class of 
stipu l ative  defin itions ;  Qu ine  does  not  return  to  them).  No  sentence  is  entirely  empir ical. 
Houses  are  just  as much  theoretical  pos its  as  electrons. Fin a l l y  there  is  a  br ief endorsement of 
pragmatism.  Wh at does Qu ine mean by this : th at it is up to us how to revise our theor ies in the 
l ight of recalcitr ant experience? ( ‘A question not of matters of fact, but of choosin g  a conven ient 
l an gu age form’ 59) That there is nothing more to truth than h avin g a theory th at works?
