XIV  LEWIS: SCOREKEEPING 

Presupposition 
Two approaches : 

Semantic :  presuppositions  are ,  in  the  first  place,  properties  of  sentences:  one  sentence 
presupposes another  (Frege) 
Pragmatic: presuppositions are , in  the first place, properties of people, or, at least, of people’s 
attitudes:  people  believe,  or  otherwise  accept,  a  certain  set  of  sentences,  and  these  are  the 
presuppositions of a conversation (Stalnaker, Lewis) 

The  rule  of  accommodation  for  presupposition.  No te  its  limit:  we  might  fill  a  void  by  a 
presuppositionally required sentence, bu t do we reject pr ior beliefs? 

Permissibility 
Note  the  different  forms  that  the  master ’s  orders  might  have:  ‘You  are  requ ired  to  shu t  the 
door’;  ‘You  w ill  shut  the  door’;  ‘Shut  the  door’.  Do  all  come  out  as  true  on  Lewis’s  account? 
And do we also accommodate speakers’ authority? 

Vagueness 
The  account  here  is  basically  supervaluational  (a  vague  sentence  is  true  iff  it  is  true  on  all 
precis ifications),  but  w ith  the  additional  feature  that  a  sentence  can  count  as  true  if  it  is  ‘true 
enough ’,  where  this  is  understood  as  obtain ing  when  it  is  true  in  a  large  enough  set  of 
precis ification.  But  then  context  w ill  determine  what  is  meant  by  large  enough;  and  this  in 
turn  will  be  governed  by  a  rule  of  accommodation.  Note  the  tendency  of  standards  to  go  up 
easily as a result of accommodation , but to  come down is harder. 

Relative Modality 
‘Can ’ and ‘Must’ as relative to certain worlds. Again the tendency to change is asymmetric. 

Special  application :  knowledge.  To  know  something  is  to  exclude  its  falsity  from  all  of  the 
relevant  possibilities.  A  possibility  is  no t  relevant  iff  it  is  properly  ignored.  Lewis ’s  rules 
governing when a poss ibil ity is properly ignored (a selection from ‘Elusive Knowledge’): 

Rule of Actuality (the actual world  is never properly ignored)

Rule of Belief (what you believe to obtain  is not properly ignored, even  if it is false)


PHI 24.251  SPRING 2005  RICHARD HOLTON 

Rule  of  Resemblance  (a  world  which  is  saliently  like  one  which  is  not  properly  ignored  is

not properly ignored)

Rule of Attention (a world which is not ignored is not properly ignored)


Performatives 
Against  Austin,  Lew is  holds  that  declarative  performative  sentences  (e.g.  ‘I  promise  to  be 
there’) have truth conditions in a straightforward way. ‘I promise to be there’ is  true just in case 
I  promise  to  be  there;  and  since,  typically,  there  is  no  more  to  promising  than  utter ing  the 
appropr iate  sentence  with  the  appropr iate  intent,  such  utterances  will  typically  make 
themselves  true.  (Note  that  this  doesn ’t  make  all  performatives  true  just  in  virtue  of  uttering 
them;  ‘I  command  you  to  open  the  door ’  is  perhaps  true  whenever  I  sincerely  assert  it,  bu t  ‘I 
legitimately command  you  to open  the door’ requ ires much more  if  it  is  to be true;  and  ‘I marry 
you’ requires all sorts of  things.)  If  this  is r ight though, why does  it sound  so odd  to  say  that  a 
performative  is true?
