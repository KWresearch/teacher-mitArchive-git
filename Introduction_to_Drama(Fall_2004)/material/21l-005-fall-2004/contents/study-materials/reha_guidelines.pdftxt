GUIDELINES/CHECKLIST for scene rehearsal and class leadership. 


In rehearsal: 

Assign roles.  

Discuss conceptual questions (script analysis; themes; structure; characterization; 

language; style) 

Discuss production questions (how to realize the concepts visually using costume, props, 

setting; how to use the space, block movements, create sound effects, etc.) 

Read through and discuss, respond to each otherâ€™s approach. 


On your own (as well as in rehearsal): 

Read through and memorize your lines and blocking. 

Do the research needed to provide sufficient context for understanding the play. 

Get the props, do the production work necessary for your scene. 


When you come to lead the class and perform:

Feel confident about your scene presentation. 

Be organized as to the way in which you will frame the discussion and the scene 

presented. 

Have specific questions and topics you wish the class to address.
