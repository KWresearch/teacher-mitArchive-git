21L005 Introduction to Drama 
Thesis statement worksheet: correct and/or improve, as you see fit: 

1. People from different backgrounds often have varying beliefs regarding suicide, with some feeling 
it brings honor and others believing it is barbaric. 

2. The Bride as a symbol for life in death: as Elesin dies, the Bride must turn her mind to the unborn, 
as Iyaloja remarks. 

3. The play “Translations” by Brian Friel uses characterization to portray the layers that underlie a 
culture and how translation is not just a change of words, but also a change in the interpretation and 
representation of characters and understanding of the surrounding world. 

4.Through tone, the character Goods embodies the vanity of secular life, causing the audience 
members to fear for their souls.

Discussion: 
1. People from different backgrounds often have varying beliefs regarding suicide, with some feeling 
it brings honor and others believing it is barbaric. 

[Claim is not specific to, or even applied to, a particular play. Is this arguable or capable of being 
shown invalid? If not, it may accurately describe the world but not lead to a focused analysis with an 
argumentative edge.] 

2. The Bride as a symbol for life in death: as Elesin dies, the Bride must turn her mind to the unborn, 
as Iyaloja remarks. 

[Rephrase first topic phrase into thesis.  Is the sentence that comes after the colon reporting a moment 
in the play, serving as “evidence” of a larger claim, or what?] 

3. The play “Translations” by Brian Friel uses characterization to portray the layers that underlie a 
culture and how translation is not just a change of words, but also a change in the interpretation and 
representation of characters and understanding of the surrounding world. 

[Too general: huge (and important) topics, but too big a focus even for a longer essay.  Not a clear 
sense of direction for the reader: are we going to talk about all the characters—and then the 
surrounding world as well?] 

4.Through tone, the character Goods embodies the vanity of secular life, causing the audience 
members to fear for their souls. 

[Always tricky to speculate on effects, although one can argue rationally that the text provides clues.  
The challenge will be to capture exactly how “tone…embodies the vanity of secular life”—if that is 
precisely what it does.]
