During the fall of 2004, two sessions of 21L.005 were recorded especially for
OpenCourseWare. These sessions feature students' discussion and performance of
Luigi Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author and Bertolt Brecht's
Galileo.Â The students formed two groups, the Pirandellans and Brechtians, each
with the task of performing scenes from the selected play and leading the class
discussion and analysis of that particular work. Below are links to the videos.
