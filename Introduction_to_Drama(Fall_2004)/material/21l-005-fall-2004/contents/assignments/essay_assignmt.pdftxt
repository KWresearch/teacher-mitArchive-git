Introduction to Drama 
Research Essay Assignment: some reminders and guidelines 

The essay is due by 5 p.m. on Friday, December 3; if you do not give the essay to me in 
person, leave it in my mailbox and make sure you have a clean back-up copy. 

Your research is meant to provide you with a context for locating a particular play, within 
its time and place of production.  I ask that you examine at least five different sources of 
information so as to distinguish generally accepted “facts” from scholarly hypotheses, as 
well as to encourage you to consider a variety of perspectives on or facets of the dramatic 
context.  Depending on the play and country you have chosen, you may need to narrow 
your area of focus (e.g., not trying to learn about all French drama if you are looking at a 
particular era) or you may need to widen it (e.g., if the country’s political history or 
religion informs the drama).  The research provides another way to understand the 
dramatic text, to supplement—not replace—your careful, close reading of the play. 

Your essay should focus on analyzing some dimension(s) of the play within its cultural 
context, national and/or artistic.  I do not expect or desire a “laundry list” of possible 
topical allusions or ways the play fits conventions; rather, I ask that you develop a main 
argument or thesis that addresses a particularly interesting aspect of the play in 
relationship to its cultural location.  Use specific textual evidence from the play, as well 
as the research you have done, to support your claims.   

The essay should be double-spaced with standard margins, and should include a title and 
a bibliography.  Proofread carefully, editing the essay in accordance with the guidelines 
provided in any standard composition handbook available (many are in the Writing 
Center). 

I hope the experience of doing research and studying a play on your own has been, and 
will continue to be, both educational and enjoyable.  Please feel free to come see me if 
you want to discuss the work in progress.  Best of luck!
