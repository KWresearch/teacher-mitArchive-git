***** Projects *****
You'll complete three small software development projects, each of which goes
all the way from specification and design to coding and testing. All projects
will be done in teams of three students. Projects 1 and 2 have a deliverable
after one week (usually involving exploring the problem and working on design
issues), and a second, final deliverable after the second week. Project 3 is a
three-week project, with three deliverables.
Each project will be preceded by a lab assignment to help you get up to speed
with the project's technology. Lab assignments will be done individually.
                                Project files.
