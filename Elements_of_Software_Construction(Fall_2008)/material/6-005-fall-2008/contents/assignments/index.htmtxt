***** Explorations *****
A series of three case studies will be presented in lecture, in order to
illustrate the concepts being taught on substantial examples. Before each case
study, you will implement a solution to the case study problem yourself, both
to give you practice coding in Java, and to introduce you to the case study.
To use the supporting files in Eclipse, choose the folder containing the
unzipped files, using File >> Import >> Existing Project into Workspace.
                               Assignment files.

***** Problem Sets *****
To consolidate your understanding of the lecture ideas, you'll do three problem
sets, one on each paradigm. Like projects, problem sets will involve both
design and implementation work, but the problems will be smaller and less open-
ended.
               Assignment files.
PROBLEMÂ SETS
Problem set 1: The state machine paradigm (PDF)
Problem set 2: The symbolic paradigm (PDF)
Problem set 3: The relational paradigm (PDF)
