Problem Set 3: The Relational Paradigm 

6.005 Elements of Software Construction | Fall 2008 
Problem Set 3: The Relational Paradigm 

The purpose of this problem set is to give you practice in the basic techniques of the 
relational paradigm. You'll construct a variety of object models, and code one of them using 
standard patterns. You'll also do a small exercise to check that you understand some of the 
complexities of of mutable datatypes. 

Mutable Datatypes 

Investigating Java's Set. The specification of java.util.Set says that a set should not 
contain itself. Write a JUnit test for one of the standard Java library implementations of Set 
that violates this rule and fails; explain what's happening carefully and succinctly; and explain 
how the principles of the lecture on mutable types address this issue. 

Object Modeling 

For each of the following problems, construct (1) a graphical object model, accompanied by 
(2) designations that give a crisp and precise one sentence meaning for each set and relation 
name, and (3) three object diagrams showing interesting cases of instances satisfying the 
model. 

Sudoku. Model the state of a puzzle, allowing for both completed and incomplete grids, and 
making explicit the grouping into rows, columns and subgrids. 

Slide Animation. Model a slide containing textual and graphical elements, along with 
settings for animation. Include grouping of elements, and appearance order and effects. 

Domain Name System (DNS). Model domain names and the architecture for resolving 
them. Your model should include the structure of the domain names, their relationship to IP 
addresses, the network of domain name solvers, and caches (and little else!). For an 
explanation of DNS, see the wikipedia article. Do not worry about the low level structure of 
DNS records; your model should show the structure of the system (and the state of the 
servers) at an abstract level. 

Problem Set 3: The Relational Paradigm 

Social Network. Model a social network (as found, for example, in Facebook, MySpace and 
LinkedIn) that includes the following features: members, friendship, groups, profiles, posted 
objects, tagged photos, recent activity feeds, pending invitations. 

Election Ballots. Model the voter input in a US federal election, consisting of a set of marked 
ballots, containing sufficient information to determine the outcome of the presidential 
election, senate and congressional races, and state ballot questions. 

Address Book. Model an email address book that associates user-defined names with email 
addresses, and includes the ability to distinguish home and work addresses, forming groups 
of multiple addresses, and using indirection to allow groups to contain groups and user-
defined names. 

Object Model Implementation 

Implement an address book, based on the object model that you constructed. Your address 
book should provide an API, as a class AddressBook, that provides key operations for 
entering and editing entries, displaying entries, and for resolving a user-defined name to the 
email addresses it represents. Indicate precisely which object model implementation patterns 
you used, and how they were applied to derive the implementation structure from the object 
model. Construct a suite of test cases based on partitioning that gives reasonable coverage of 
the specification of the API, and make sure to include the three sample instances that you 
devised for your object model. 

Your solution will be judged on the clarity of structure of your code, on how well you mapped 
the model to the code, on the quality of design of your API, and on quality of the testing you 
performed. 

Infrastructure 

No code is provided for this problem set. A directory called ps3 will be created for you in your 
personal repository, containing a copy of this file. In addition to your code and test cases, you 
should commit your solutions to the exercises as a single PDF file.
