S is a set 

abstract 
S 

S is an abstract set: 
all its elements are contained 
by subsets that extend it 

Multiplicity symbols 
*  any number (default) 
?  zero or one 
!  exactly one 
+  one or more 

S is a set with multiplicity m 

S is a set with multiplicity m ; 
if present, m must be ? or ! 
and defaults to ! if missing

S1 and S2 are subsets of S,

and are disjoint;

no label means extends


S1 and S2 are subsets of S 
and are not necessarily disjoint 
from each other (or from other sets 
that extend S) 

S 

m R n 

T


R is a relation from S to T with multiplicities m and n 
Maps m atoms in S to each atom in T, and each atom in S to n atoms in T 
Corresponds to the textual constraint R: S m -> n T 
R may be any relational expression 

S 

m <A>.R n 

T


R is a ternary relation from A to S to T 
for each atom a in A, a.R is a relation with multiplicities m and n 
Corresponds to the textual constraint all a: A | a.R : S m -> n T
