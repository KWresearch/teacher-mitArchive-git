Guidelines for Evaluating Participation
(Acknowledgement: Prof. John Tyler at Brown University) 

 
Outstanding Contributor (5 points): Contributions in class reflect exceptional preparation. Ideas offered 
are always substantive, provide one or more major insights as well as direction for the class. Challenges 
are well substantiated and persuasively presented. If this person were not a member of the class, the 
quality of discussion would be diminished markedly.  
 
Good Contributor (4 points): Contributions in class reflect thorough preparation. Ideas offered are usually 
substantive, provide good insights and sometimes direction for the class. Challenges are well 
substantiated and often persuasive. If this person were not a member of the class, the quality of discussion 
would be diminished.  
 
Adequate Contributor (3 points): Contributions in class reflect satisfactory preparation. Ideas offered are 
sometimes substantive, provide generally useful insights but seldom offer a new direction for the 
discussion. Challenges are sometimes presented, fairly well substantiated, and are sometimes persuasive. 
If this person were not a member of the class, the quality of discussion would be diminished somewhat.  
 
Non-Participant (0 points): This person says little or nothing in class. Hence, there is not an adequate 
basis for evaluation. If this person were not a member of the class, the quality of discussion would not be 
changed.  
 
Unsatisfactory Contributor (negative points): Contributions in class reflect inadequate preparation. Ideas 
offered are seldom substantive, provide few if any insights and never a constructive direction for the 
class. Integrative comments and effective challenges are absent. If this person were not a member of the 
class, valuable air-time would be saved.
