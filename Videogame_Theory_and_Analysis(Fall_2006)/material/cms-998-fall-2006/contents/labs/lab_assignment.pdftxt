Analysis Assignment 
Videogame Theory & Analysis Course 
Monday Night Game Lab 
 
Each Monday night in lab, up to five students will present moments in their games to the rest of 
the class. These presentations should meet and often exceed the expectations laid out below. 
Undergraduate students will be expected to complete this assignment three times throughout the 
semester; graduate students will present more often. 
 
Goals and Expectations 
This analysis assignment is meant to give you practice and experience with presenting your 
theories, analyses, and ideas to a friendly audience. It is my hope that as you read and consider 
the materials we discuss during the week, you will begin to connect those ideas to your 
experiences with your game. If there are particularly interesting moments, ideas, concepts, 
happenings, etc. with your game that you think are relevant to class discussions, readings, and 
course materials, you are encouraged to sign up for a Monday night analysis. You will then bring 
your game (or recorded moment in the game) to class and present your analysis in lab. 
 
Analyses can be either a close reading of a particular moment in a game or else a broader (but 
focused) discussion of a particular game rule, narrative structure, character model, social 
phenomenon, etc. that you consider relevant and meaningful. For example, you may wish to 
present the WoW community’s reactions and dealings with Chinese farmers; or the way that 
Halo’s tutorial level expertly teaches players the game’s “design grammar” (Gee) in a safe way; 
or perhaps you want to show KoToR’s innovations with game ethics. Whatever your choice, you 
are free (indeed, encouraged) to discuss it with me first so that I can help you focus the 
presentation. 
 
Logistics and Parameters 
You are responsible for recording and preparing the moment in your game that you are 
analyzing. For help, ask friends, colleagues, others in the class. 
You are required to provide a handout to go along with your presentation. The handout can be in 
the form of a short paper, a multimedia video, a transcript of an in-game discussion or 
interaction, an outline of a longer paper you’ll write for your midterm and/or final project, etc.  
Presentations should take about 20-30 minutes. 
Presentations should reference and connect to readings in the course.  
Presentations are conducted individually, but you may consult others in your preparation and 
collaborate with others who are playing your same game or have experience with your topic. 
Presentations are not necessarly arguments for your particular approach to your game; instead, 
they should take the form of analyses, connecting theory to the text or experience you’re 
examining. Tell us what you notice, what you observe, what’s interesting to you and for what 
reasons. Criticism and arguments will begin to form later in the semester, but toward the 
beginning, we’re just looking for focused, detailed observations, themes, and connections 
between reading and gameplay.

Evaluation Criteria 
Analyses will be evaluated according to the following: 
(cid:137)  Your ability to connect an idea or concept brought up in class and/or through the theories 
presented in the reading and show how your game reflects, complicates, enhances, or 
demonstrates a topic from game studies. 
(cid:137)  Your detail with regard to the moment or topic of your presentation. These should be 
tight, focused, in-depth analyses of particular moments or game phenomena. I’ll be 
looking for evidence that you’ve thought critically about the game moment/phenomenon 
you’ve chosen to present. 
(cid:137)  Clarity and polish of the presentation and handout.  

 
I will provide you with written feedback and a final grade on your presentation. Students are 
encouraged to consult with me prior to and following an analysis, as each of these presentations 
should be considered a possible springboard toward future work in the course.  
 
It is my hope that as you work through your analyses presentations you’ll use them as an 
opportunity to brainstorm and think through ideas for your final project. I imagine that you will 
use these presentations as an opportunity to apply what knowledge you’ve gained from reading 
and discussing the game theory we read. Evaluations will ultimately based on how well you 
show your ability to connect your reading to your gameplay experiences.
