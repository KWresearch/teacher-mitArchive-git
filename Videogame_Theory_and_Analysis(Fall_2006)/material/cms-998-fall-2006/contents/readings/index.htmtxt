L4-L5 Narratology    **** Notes ****
      and Ludology   The topics range from the relationship between story and game to the relationship
                     between developers and academics, with discussion of the institutional situation of
                     game studies programs as well. Henry has some great comments about spatial story and
                     the relationship of games to other narrative-evoking environments; Espen's
                     discussion of the need for a diversity of approaches - not just "narratology" and
                     "ludology" - is also quite good to hear. Espen even explains how game studies should
                     take literary studies as a model! You'll have to watch the video yourself to find
                     out what the context is for this suggestion - it's about 49 minutes in.
