Short Writing Assignment 
MMOGs 
9/26/06 
DUE: Friday, 9/29/06 to the class website 
 
This week you read several accounts of MMOGs from the current emerging scholars in game 
studies: Constance Steinkuehler, Edward Castronova, Nick Yee, and TL Taylor. Each provided 
an account of their observations and analyses of MMOGs from their disciplinary perspectives—
cognitive psychology and linguistics, economics, statistical psychology, and sociological 
anthropology. These readings are great models for the level of analysis I’d like you to attempt in 
this essay. 
 
In particular, many of these writers talked specifically about what James Gee refers to as the 
“external design grammar” of games—the collection of activities that players engage with 
outside of and around gameplay itself. In a short essay, I would like you to write about your own 
game and its surrounding culture. How does the community talk about your game? Specifically, 
how would you characterize the nature of the player community surrounding your game? 
Critical? Analytical? Descriptive? Organizational? Inquisitive? How can you account for the 
community’s character? How does it relate to the game and the way the game is structured and 
organized?  
 
It is important here that you don’t simply describe the player community for your game but that 
you also analyze it. Analyses require some sort of observations that go beyond simple 
descriptions: you should attempt to synthesize the patterns you observe, categorize them, talk 
about trends, conceptual ideas, etc. Descriptions can be used to support your analysis, but they 
should not be guiding framework for it. 
 
Essays should be at least 5 typed, double-spaced pages, 1” margins, Times New Roman font. 
Please put your last name and page number on each page.  
 
Electronic copies may be submitted to the course website, but file names should follow this 
structure: LAST NAME, DATE.  
 
*Essays will be evaluated on the depth of your analysis and the degree to which you are able to 
connect what you describe and observe to some sort of conclusion or account for why you think 
what you observe is happening. In other words, if you write that your game community is largely 
critical, you should attempt to describe what it is about the game that you think enables and 
encourages this critical community to emerge.
