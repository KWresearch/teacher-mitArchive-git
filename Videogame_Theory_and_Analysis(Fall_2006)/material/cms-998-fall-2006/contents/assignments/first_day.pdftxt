Assignment: CMS 998/600 
Due: Thursday 9/14/06 
 
First assignment: choose a game. 
 
For your first assignment, I’d like you to choose the game you’ll play this semester. It can be a PC or 
console game, but it must be a contemporary commercial videogame, the kind you could buy at a game 
store today. 
 
But before you choose your game, I’d like you to do a little research and then write a brief, one-page 
thought piece on what the research told you, why you valued the sources you chose, and why you chose 
the game you did. Then, I’d like you to add a few sentences (bullet points are acceptable too) stating what 
you hope to learn, accomplish, or achieve by playing your game.  
 
You are encouraged to choose a game that you think will be satisfying and motivating, but it MUST be a 
game that’s NEW to you. In other words, if you’re already a World of Warcraft player, you can’t just re-
roll. You need to choose a new MMO or a different genre of game altogether. 
 
For your research, you are required to consult the following sources (and please cite them using either 
MLA, Chicago, or APA format—consult the Writing Center for help on that if you need it): 
 
At minimum: 
 

•  THREE human beings (can be cited as “personal interviews”) 

 

 

 

•  FIVE online sources  

•  TWO print sources  

•  ONE “other” (cid:197)your choice 

 
Warning: it might take you a while to do this! Be sure to leave time for proper formatting for your cited 
sources. A good resource is http://www.wisc.edu/writing/Handbook/Documentation.html if you need an 
online reference guide. 
 
Please submit all of this in writing to me next THURSDAY at the start of class. Usual formatting rules 
apply: Times New Roman 12 point font, one-inch margins, double-spaced, name on paper, staple pages, 
etc.
