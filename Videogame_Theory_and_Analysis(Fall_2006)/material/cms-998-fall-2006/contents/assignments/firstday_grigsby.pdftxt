"Choosing a Game"Assignment

Mainstream media and cultural studies typically associate video games with adolescence, 

particularly male adolescence.  When gamers are represented in film and television, they are 

almost exclusively teen boys or emotionally immature men, as with friends Seth and Ryan on 

The O.C., the boyish Los Angelinos in Swingers, or the title character of The 40 Year-Old Virgin.  

Folklorist Sharon R. Sherman attempts to explain the appeal of games to adolescents in an 

analysis of Super Mario Bros. as monomyth: "Like ritual, the adventure game represents a 

transitional state which must be overcome" (251). She then links this state to adolescence's own 

liminality.  But for a medium so theoretically bound to the adolescent life stage, game narratives 

have had relatively few recognizably teen heroes when compared to TV, literature, and film.  

Where are the medium's Holden Caulfields, the Buffy Summerses, the Ferris Buellers? 

 

I intend to play through a historical survey of teen characters in games.  A friend has 

loaned me the fighting game Rival Schools, which pits stereotypical teens against each other and 

a common enemy in order to save the world.  What I did not know, according to the Wikipedia 

entry for the game, is that the Japanese version of the second disc included a dating sim.  

Japanese dating sims have only rarely been ported to the English language but represent perhaps 

the only game genre which consistently offers representations of teen school life.  My survey 

should include a title from this genre.  The Dating Sim FAQ at Megatokyo.com cites Tokemeki 

Memorial as the most popular series.  Konami is finally releasing an Americanized version of the 

genre with Brooktown High: Senior Year co-designed by a CMS alum (In Media Res, 14).  

Unfortunately, it's PSP only, but the discourse around it is likely to be evocative. 

 

Conversations with knowledgeable friends about teens in games yielded some additional 

recommendation.  Kristina Drzaic was enthusiastic to recommend Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of 

Time, which involved the eternally childlike hero Link being unnaturally aged to late 

adolescence.  Ivan Askwith advised, "Psychonauts  is great at taking a weird look at adolescent 

issues through a sort of twisted filter."  Stefan Werning, a visiting game scholar, previously 

brought to my attention the Japanese "raiser" game Princess Maker, in which the player guides 

the development of an adopted teenage daughter. 

 

The 400lb gorilla of teen games, however, is yet to be released.  Bully from Rockstar 

Games, makers of the Grand Theft Auto series, is scheduled for release this October, a year after 

its original release date.  Controversy has surrounded the game, with anti-gaming litigator Jack 

Thompson calling it a "Columbine simulator" before anyone has actually played it (qtd. in 

Jones).  An early article described the plot in this way: "it’s now your turn to rule the school 

through intimidation and—when needed—muscle" (Intihar).  In short, you are the titular bully.  

After the year-long delay, some believe Rockstar was modifying the plot to appease parents and 

interest groups (Totilo).  A new trailer for the game indeed suggests that the main character is 

now an underdog kid who, in part, protects the weak from bullies.  "This school is filled with 

bullies and maniacs!" he exclaims incredulously to a teacher (Rockstar Games, Bully Trailer 1). 

 

I shall occupy myself during the first half of the semester with Rival Schools, Tokemeki 

Memorial or another relevant dating sim, Princess Maker 2, Psychonauts, and Ocarina of Time.  

When and if Bully is finally released, I'll hopefully be able to use skills acquired through 

hundreds of hours of playing Grand Theft Auto to complete the game in a timely manner.  I'll be 

looking for how the medium of video game transforms conventions from adolescence narratives 

in other media, and critically examine this implicit link between the experiences of gaming and 

adolescent development.
