[Image showing ways of structuring knowledge representations using directed
networks.]
Human learning and reasoning is founded on multiple knowledge representations
with different kinds of structures, such as trees, chains, dominance
hierarchies, neighborhood graphs, and directed networks. This class uses
probabilistic inference methods from machine learning and Bayesian statistics,
operating over different kinds of structured representational systems, to
explain how people's domain knowledge can support a wide range of learning and
reasoning tasks, and how these knowledge structures may themselves be learned
from experience. (Image by Prof. Joshua Tenenbaum.)

***** Course Description *****
This course is an introduction to computational theories of human cognition.
Drawing on formal models from classic and contemporary artificial intelligence,
students will explore fundamental issues in human knowledge representation,
inductive learning and reasoning. What are the forms that our knowledge of the
world takes? What are the inductive principles that allow us to acquire new
knowledge from the interaction of prior knowledge with observed data? What
kinds of data must be available to human learners, and what kinds of innate
knowledge (if any) must they have?
