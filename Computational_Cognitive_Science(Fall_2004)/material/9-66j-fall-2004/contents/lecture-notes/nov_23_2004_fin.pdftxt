A Bayesian dream

Prior based on mutations over tree structure 
addresses all the challenges to traditional 
Bayesian concept learning (Mitchell, 
Tenenbaum, etc.) 
– Assign a reasonable prior over all logically 
possible concepts (labelings) in a potentially 
unbounded domain, with natural Occam’s razor. 
– Efficiently integrate over all logically possible 
concepts consistent with the training data. 
– Robust with respect to label noise. 
– PAC-style guarantees of generalization.

uncomfortable with typicality effects & exceptions. 
•	 New story: Typicality & exceptions compatible with 
rational statistical inference over hierarchy.

Conclusions 

•	 Beyond classic dichotomies of  “domain-specific vs. 
domain-general”, or “structured theories vs. statistical 
learning”. 
–	 Bayes provides a powerful domain-general statistical engine for 
generalizing reliably from limited data. 
–	 Theories generate structured domain-specific priors that provide 
crucial constraints for Bayesian induction. 
•	 Advantages of Theory-based Bayesian models:

–	 Strong quantitative models of generalization behavior, with 
minimal free parameters or arbitrary assumptions. 
–	 Flexibility to model different patterns of reasoning that arise 
with different kinds of properties, using differently structured 
theories (but the same general-purpose Bayesian engine). 
–	 Framework for explaining why inductive generalization works.

Theory-based Bayesian framework


•  The big questions:

– How are new properties learned, guided by a 
T0 theory? 
– How is a T0 theory learned, guided by a T1 
level theory? 
– How are T1 theories learned?  


Theory-based Bayesian framework


•  The big questions:

– How does a T0 theory generate a hypothesis 
space of properties? 
– How does a T1 theory generate a hypothesis 
space of T0 theories? 
– What does the hypothesis space of T1 theories 
look like? (i.e., what are the T2 and higher-
level theories?) 

Theory-based Bayesian framework


•  The big questions:

– How do we figure out which theory to use for 
which properties? 
– What structures and relations exist between 
properties? 
•  Clusters, hierarchies

•  Ordered dimensions  

•  Causal networks 
– How do structures over properties relate to 
structures over classes?
