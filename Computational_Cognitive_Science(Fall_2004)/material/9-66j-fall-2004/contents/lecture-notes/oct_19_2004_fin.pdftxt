Problem sets

• Late policy  (5% off per day, but the 
weekend counts as only one day).  E.g.,
– Friday: -5%
– Monday: -15%
– Tuesday: -20%
– Thursday: -30%

Outline

• Final thoughts on hierarchical Bayesian 
models and MCMC
• Bayesian classification
• Bayesian concept learning

MCMC methods
• Gibbs sampling
– Factorize hypotheses h = <h1, h2, …, hn>
– Cycle through variables h1, h2, …, hn
– Draw hi
(t+1) from P(hi|h-i, evidence)

• Metropolis-Hastings
– Propose changes to hypothesis from some 
distribution Q(h(t+1)| h(t))
– Accept proposals with probability 
P(h(t+1)|evidence) Q(h(t)| h(t +1))
A(h(t+1)| h(t)) = min{ 1,                                            }
P(h(t)|evidence) Q(h(t+1)| h(t))

Why MCMC is important 

• Simple
• Can be used with just about any kind of 
probabilistic model, including complex 
hierarchical structures
• Always works pretty well, if you’re willing 
to wait a long time

(cf. Back-propagation for neural networks.)

A model for cognitive 
development?
• Some features of cognitive development:
– Small, random, dumb, local steps 
– Takes a long time
– Can get stuck in plateaus or stages
– “Two steps forward, one step back”
– Over time, intuitive theories get consistently 
better (more veridical, more powerful, broader 
scope). 
– Everyone reaches basically the same state 
(though some take longer than others).

Topic models of semantic structure: e.g., Latent 
Dirichlet Allocation (Blei, Ng, Jordan)
– Each document in a corpus is associated with a 
distribution θover topics.
– Each topic t is associated with a distribution φ(t) 
over words.

Darker words are more likely to have been generated from the
topic-based “semantics” module:

Outline

• Final thoughts on hierarchical Bayesian 
models and MCMC
• Bayesian classification
• Bayesian concept learning

Concepts and categories

• A category is a set of objects that are treated 
equivalently for some purpose. 
• A concept is a mental representation of the 
category.
• Functions for concepts:
– Categorization/classification
– Prediction
– Inductive generalization
– Explanation
– Reference in communication and thought

• Classical view of concepts (1950’s-1960’s): 
Concepts are rules or symbolic 
representations for classifying.
• Examples
– Psychology: Bruner et al.

"Striped and Three Borders":
Conjunctive Concept

Learning
• Hypothesis space of possible Gaussians:

Images removed due to copyright considerations.

• Find parameters that maximize likelihood of 
examples.
jµr
= mean of examples of class j.
–
iσ
= standard deviation along dimension i, for 
–
examples in each class.

Relevance to human concept 
learning
• Natural categories often have Gaussian (or 
other simple parametric forms) in 
perceptual feature spaces.
• Prototype effects in categorization (Rosch)
• Posner & Keele studies of prototype 
abstraction in concept learning.

Unseen prototype (“Schema”) classified as well as memorized
variants, and much better than new random variants (“5”).

Limitations

• Of this empirical paradigm?
• Of this computational approach?

Limitations
• Is categorization just discrimination among mutually 
exclusive classes?  
– Overlapping concepts? Hierarchies?  “None of the above”? 
Can we learn a single new concept?
• How do we learn concepts from just a few positive 
examples? 
– Learning with high certainty from little data.
– Schema abstraction from one imperfect example.
• Are most categories Gaussian, or any simple 
parametric shape?  
– What about superordinate categories?
– What about learning rule-based categories? 

Limitations
• Is prototypicality = degree of membership?
– Armstrong et al.: No, for classical rule-based categories
– Not for complex real-world categories either: “Christmas 
eve”, “Hollywood actress”, “Californian”, “Professor”
– For natural kinds, huge variability in prototypicality 
independent of membership.
• Richer concepts? 
– Meaningful stimuli, background knowledge, theories?
– Role of causal reasoning? “Essentialism”?
• Difference between “perceptual” and “cognitive” 
concepts?
