GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR REFERENCES 
IN HISTORY RESEARCH PAPERS 

I. FOOT/ENDNOTES. 
 
Notes can be either at the bottom of the page (footnotes) or collected at the back 
of the paper, after the main text (endnotes). 
 
The general form for first references to books is as follows:  Robert M. Fogelson, 
Downtown: Its Rise and Fall, 1880-1950 (New Haven, 2001), 10.  Sometimes references 
also include the name of the publisher, i.e. (Yale University Press: New Haven, 2001).   
If the next source cited is the same, it should be cited as “Ibid.” or, if the page changes, 
“Ibid, 32.”  If you cite the same book later, after citing other works, use a short version, 
i.e. “Fogelson, Downtown, 73.”  A “p.” or “pp.” for “page” or “pages” can be inserted 
before the page number.  Sometimes authors use roman numerals for volumes and Arabic 
numbers for pages, as in the next example.  
Articles in professional journals are cited as follows: Winthrop D. Jordan, 
“Familial Politics: Thomas Paine and the Killing of the King, 1776,” Journal of American 
History, LX (1973), 294-309.  Again, if you refer to the same article in the very next 
reference, use “Ibid.” or “Ibid., 300.”  If you want to cite an article again after having 
cited other sources in intervening notes, use a shortened version of the first reference as 
follows: Jordan, “Familial Politics,” 300. 
Articles in newspapers can be cited as follows: “Rioters Ravage Chicago,” New 
York Times, July 15, 1919, p. 1.  Thereafter you normally use “Ibid.” or cite the 
newspaper, date, and page.   Where the author is important, he or she should be included:  
Samuel Adams, “What I Saw at the Boston Massacre,” Boston Gazette, April 5, 1770, p. 
2.  A subsequent citation where “Ibid.” is inappropriate might be Adams, “Boston 
Massacre” or Boston Gazette, April 5, 1770, p.2.    If you use a quotation from a 
secondary account, say that: Chicago Tribune, April 1, 1890, cited in Fogelson, 
Downtown, 51.   
Documents in printed (or website) collections must be identified: Virginia Bill of 
Rights, June 12, 1776, in Samuel Eliot Morison, ed., Sources and Documents Illustrating 
the American Revolution…, 2nd ed. (Oxford and New York, 1929), 149-51.  Here, as in 
all foot/endnotes, the rule of thumb is that you should give what information your readers 
will need if they want to find your source and check it out themselves.  
II. BIBLIOGRAPHIES. 
Where possible, separate primary and secondary sources.  Bibliographies are 
arranged alphabetically by the authors’ last names, for example: 
Primary Sources: 
Dumpty, Humpty, “My Rise and Fall,” Newsweek, August 10, 2000, pp. 12-13.  
The New York Times, August 15- September 30, 1998. 
   (Do NOT cite articles separately here; you do that in footnotes, as you use them.) 
Washington, George, The Papers of George Washington, Colonial Series, I, 1748-August 
1755.  W.W. Abbot, ed.  Charlottesville, Virginia, 1983. 
Secondary Sources: 
Fogelson, Robert M., Big-City Police.  Cambridge, 1977.  (OR Harvard University Press; 
Cambridge, 1977.) 
Harris, George, “The End of the World,” Journal of Catastrophes, XII (2000): 1-50.
