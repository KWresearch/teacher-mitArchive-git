Mathew Brady and the Civil War  

When civil war erupted between the United and Confederate states in 1861, few 

expected a conflict of such length which would claim over 600,000 American lives.1  The 

extent and violence of the Civil War cannot be pinned to any single cause—but may be 

well explained by the technological and methodological state of warfare at this point in 

history.  Such devastating losses had never before been seen in warfare, and that this 

conflict became one of the first captured by photography appears, at first glance, rather 

unfortunate.  But a connection between the ghastly photographs of countless casualties 

and the mismatch of weapons and tactics cannot be ignored.  Photography had advanced 

to the point of portability, but could not yet capture the rapid motion inherent in battles.  

What was left for Mathew Brady and his team of war photographers?  Still life: portraits, 

landscapes, and the motionless dead.  Mathew Brady built his fame on photographing the 

political heroes of the day, chose to photograph the Civil War, and fell to professional 

ruin after the war ended.  The length and destruction of the Civil War forever changed the

face of American heroism, and Mathew Brady cemented his own professional demise by 

capturing the horrific effects of this “modern” war, replacing lists of dead and reports of 

violence with stunning photographic images.  While his images create a sad record of the 

death in the Civil War, his rise to and fall from fame expose another powerful image: that 

of an entire nation wounded and forever changed by the Civil War.   

No clear record exists of Brady’s birth or early life.  He claimed a county in 

upstate New York as his birthplace, and an unverifiable birth date of 1823.2  He arrived in 

New York City in 1839, an uneducated young man seeking work.  His immediate interest 

in the new field of photography allowed him to become one of the first professionals of 

the process.  That he learned the trade from Samuel Morse did not hurt: Brady met his 

first famous customers through this man of distinction.3  His reputation as an excellent 

portraitist snowballed throughout the 1840s and 1850s, and he began realizing his dream 

to capture the history of America through his professional medium.  Brady quickly set up 

a studio and began photographing the rich and famous.  Rapid success offered Brady the 

luxury of picking his own subjects, and he “tirelessly sought to make as complete and 

true a record as possible of all the great personages of his time.”4  Brady commented that 

“the camera is the eye of history.”  His future mission to photograph the civil war was for 

him a logical extension of this historical record-keeping. 

In 1858 his pursuit of the historical heroes of the day led Brady to Washington 

D.C., the place which more than anywhere else “cherished memories of the past and of its 

first illustrious citizens, the Founding Fathers.”5  His work was well accepted.  One critic 

wrote that Brady’s collection “concentrates and embalms the greatness of an era,” and

another “seemed to suggest that the mere exposure to a portrait could preserve and 

convey the full personality of a man like John C. Calhoun to one who had never known 

him.”6  In a time of such political unrest, the portraits of deceased political heroes 

displayed alongside those of active politicians offered comfort to a troubled public.  

Looking upon current politicians in Brady’s studio allowed citizens to see them as future 

political heroes, not the group of men threatening governmental collapse.  Here the 

stunning power of Brady’s portraiture is most evident.  His talent allowed him to create 

images of politicians on the brink of disunion that emanated strength and power 

equivalent to those historical heroes of generations past, men like Calhoun, Adams, and 

Jackson, whom Brady photographed before their deaths.7 

However calming, Brady’s images of Washington in the late 1850s made little 

attempt to cover the political dissention of the day.  In 1860 Brady released a large 

composite image in which he “combined individual portraits of all 250 members of the 

House and Senate into two enormous panels three by five feet.”8  The panels represented 

far more than the portraits they contained.  Patching together individual portraits— 

instead of photographing the Thirty-sixth Congress as a group—offered a subtle 

visualization of a faltering political body.  At this time the House and Senate represented 

a group of individuals consumed by “sectional loyalties,” not a single body of 

government.9  Whether intentional or not, Brady captured this shattered government mere 

months before southern secession cemented the issue.   

With war now imminent, Brady made a personal decision to photograph the 

approaching conflict.  He later commented on the decision to document the war, “I felt

8 Ibid., p. 99 
9 Panzer, Mathew Brady and the Image of History, 101 

4 

that I had to go.  A spirit in my feet said ‘Go,’ and I went.”10  What drove Brady from his 

successful studios in Washington D.C. and New York City?  Why did he leave his 

international fame—his position of “society photographer supreme”11—for the 

dangerous, largely anonymous fields of battle?  War photography was a new enterprise, 

as was all photography, but Brady was not the first.  Roger Fenton’s work on the Crimean 

war of 1855 would have been readily available at this time.  His work combined with the 

portability of new photographic methods provided for a “universal and immediate” 

connection “between war and the camera.”12  Brady’s drive also surely represents “an 

extension of his earlier efforts to accumulate portraits of men who could claim some 

significance for the present, and for posterity,”13 yet exposes a deeper connection 

between Brady and his quest than earlier works suggest.  Amassing wealth and fame 

collecting images of the rich and famous in a comfortable studio is one thing, but 

securing “permission from Washington officials to photograph the ‘coming 

unpleasantness’—at his own expense”14 represented an entirely different level of 

dedication.  Brady truly viewed his art as “the eyes of history” and felt photographers 

held the duty of collecting such history.  He collected, trained, and funded entire teams of 

photographers to follow him into the war.  One thing is certain: Brady exhibited 

peculiarly keen insight into the coming change in American heroism.  Politics failed to 

avert the Civil War—the conflict’s resolution would emerge on the field of battle.  

Military leaders would replace the politicians in public esteem, and Brady positioned 

himself to capture these new heroes.

Many believed that the Civil War would end within a few months, but as the 

“rebellion” became a full scale war both sides made haste in acquiring the most powerful 

and effective new weaponry.  These new rifles represented a significant improvement 

over older muskets, decreasing the time required to load the weapon and increasing both 

firepower and accuracy.  Soldiers armed with rifles could accurately attack enemies up to 

one hundred yards away and fire many times while marching before actually reaching 

enemy troops.  In musket warfare of the past, soldiers could not expect to inflict damage 

past fifty yards, and might fire two or three times before engaging their opponents in 

direct combat.  Because the Civil War was the first major military engagement to employ 

the new rifles as standard equipment, no tactics were available regarding their use on a 

large scale.  Top military commanders of the time, such as Robert E. Lee and George B. 

McClellan, were well taught in the tactics of musket warfare and immediately applied 

these tactics on the first battlefields of the new rifle era.  These engagements would prove 

a bloody testing ground for modern war:  “This change [in weapon technology] made 

attacking more difficult and defense more effective.  It took military officials some time 

to figure out what was going on and to change their tactical manuals accordingly.”15  This 

new technology, paired with aged tactics, created a dangerous situation where casualties 

from single battles reached levels before seen only over entire wars.  One might consider 

the photographic documentation of the Civil War unfortunate—the most experienced 

military leaders had not witnessed violence of this level, yet Brady and his 

contemporaries provided such images to all of America. 

This new level of warfare contained an interesting connection to the 

documentation of this violence: technology.  The decades prior to Southern secession 

15 Maier, et all, Inventing America 522 

6 

provided not only vast improvements in military technology but show a paralleled 

rapidity in civilian technological advancement.  The invention and development of 

photography is an excellent example of this civilian progress.  In the late 1830’s, when 

Mathew Brady arrived in New York City looking for work, a French inventor released 

“one of the first methods of capturing an image by chemical means.”16  The process 

involved no negative, instead directly producing a single image, or “daguerreotype.”  

Brady mastered the process.  But the daguerreotype might be said to represent “musket” 

photography, and quickly became obsolete.  A professional could only produce images 

approximately three by three inches in size, and each exposure created a single 

photograph—the lack of a negative meant no additional copies could be printed.  By the 

1850s a new method of photography replaced the old daguerreotype.  A new “rifle” of 

photography, the collodion process created a glass negative that could be used to produce 

limitless copies of various sizes, including occasional life sized prints.17  Brady quickly 

adapted to the change in equipment and mastered collodion, or glass-plate photography, 

as he had daguerreotypy. 

The colloidon process offered huge advancements to portrait photography, but 

was limited in a non-studio setting by the time a glass-plate negative needed to be 

exposed to light.  In the best of conditions, the chemical processes required four second 

exposures.  For portrait photography before the Civil War, a subject would have no 

problem remaining motionless for such a short length of time.  On the battlefield, 

however, soldiers were much less willing to stop and remain motionless for a four second 

exposure—the accurate weapons of their enemies could prove deadly in that time.  Brady

and his contemporaries did amazing work with the technology of the day, yet leave us 

with a skewed memory of the Civil War in which battles remain conspicuously absent.  

One photograph displays blurred masses approaching one another on the fields of 

Antietam, obscured by smoke from their own weapons.  Yet in this image, the sole 

photograph of Civil War battle, “the viewer feels the battle rage—but does not really see 

it.”18  Brady and his contemporaries risked everything to collect images of the Civil War, 

but the technology of the time forced an odd, partial record of the war in which conflict 

could not be directly photographed.  The subjects remaining for war photographers 

included landscapes, portraits of generals and armies, and the dead.  This incomplete 

account of the Civil War serves as our only visual description of the event, and has a 

great effect on how the conflict is remembered.  Gone are the notions of glorious warfare, 

majestic battles, and honorable commanders depicted in paintings of ancient battles.  

Photography of the time replaced these glorifications with the darker reality of war’s 

aftermath: shattered cities, trampled fields, and piles of dead strewn about like discarded 

dolls. 

An interesting connection between these horrific images and the conditions which 

produced such scenes exposes why Brady’s Civil War collection contains so many tragic 

photographs.  In the late 1850s, both the military and photography sat in precarious 

developmental positions.  New rifle technology vastly increased the power of weaponry, 

yet the leading generals of the age were instructed and experienced in tactics suited for 

musket warfare.  Photography had become portable, freeing it from the confines of a 

studio—yet could not capture the action inherent in most non-studio situations.  Had the 

war occurred before rifles became mainstream weapons, one might imagine a much less 

18 Kunhardt, Mathew Brady and His World.  226 

8 

destructive war—a war that would have produced no photographs.  If the war was 

delayed until generals educated in the use of rifle technology replaced their elder 

commanders, one might expect tactics designed to limit exposure of soldiers to enemy 

gunfire, thus drastically reducing casualties.  Such a delay would also allow photography 

the time needed to develop processes capable of capturing rapid motion—and war 

photographers would most likely concentrate on the battles themselves, not the aftermath.  

Yet the reality of the Civil War is much different: war broke out in an unstable period 

between these two points.  Soldiers fell dead in great numbers, and photography offered 

no means of capturing battle—only through photographing the excessive death and 

destruction of the Civil War could Brady and his contemporaries adequately describe the 

conflict. 

While the Civil War eventually destroyed his source of business, Brady’s 

experience in the war matured his photographic art, which reached a level unmatched by 

his pre-war photographs.  Brady became one of the first individuals to embrace 

photography as art, not simply a means of capturing images.  His early portraits differ 

little from paintings, with regally positioned figures in formal studio settings.  This 

phenomenon is quite prevalent in the history of invention: the first automobiles looked 

nearly identical to horse drawn carriages, early motion pictures resembled plays, and the 

first computers might be confused for typewriters with screens.  Over time, inventions 

such as these gain their own identities. 

Photography made such advancements largely as a result of war documentation.  

Once Brady took his equipment into the field, he was forced to re-examine how he 

photographed portraits.  He and his teams found limitless new backdrops to replace blank  

9

Photography offered no  reason  to avoid  transitory details, but Brady’s early work did 
not  explore  these  strengths.  The  art  of  photography  had  yet  to  emerge  from  the 
shadow  of  painting.  Brady  and  his  team  explored  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of 
photography  throughout  the Civil War, when  studios were  rarely  convenient.    Image

studio walls: campsites, forests, and landscapes.  The settings of his wartime portraits 

represent only a small change in his art form.  In the painted portraits of the past, “the 

ideal quality of a portrait depended upon the portraitist’s ability to separate the essential 

from the circumstantial.”19  Brady could duplicate this separation in carefully controlled 

studio settings.  But when he and his teams entered the business of photographing war, 

they were confronted with a change in the very nature of their work.  No longer did they 

capture only the makers of history—taking their equipment into the field allowed the 

photographers to capture history itself, as it unfolded.  And they found that in the field, 

the circumstantial details became essential.  The soldiers and locations so prominent in 

Brady’s war collection would never have made it to his pre-war studio, because “these 

figures occupy a distinct place and time; the location of the camp, the hour of the day, the 

very objects that surround the sitter all fix the subject within a particular historical 

moment.”20  Without the circumstantial surroundings, such photographs carried little 

weight.  Through exercising the portability of photography and its distinct ability to 

capture transient details, Brady pushed his portraiture from a replication of painting 

techniques to an original form of art and documentation.  This advancement in his art 

alone did not provide enough momentum for his professional survival after the war 

ended. 

War offered another change in portraiture, the photography of the dead.  

Gruesome images of lifeless bodies strewn carelessly about by rifle fire—or worse, lined 

up in neat rows for burial—provided civilians across the North a direct view into the 

horrors of war.  The public viewed these images with “a terrible fascination” during the

11 

Campsites  and  battlefields  of  the  Civil  War  offered  countless  new  backdrops  for 
Brady  and his  team.   The use of  these backdrops and a  lack of complete control over 
simple details changed Brady’s photography.   For example, notice  the man on  the  far 
left who has a pipe in his mouth and a cigar in his hand—such a mistake in the posing 
of  subjects  in  the  studio  would  not  occur.    Instead  of  photographing  the  makers  of 
history,  Brady  was  photographing  history  itself.    Image  Source:    Garrison,  W.

war and rejected them completely afterwards.21  Warfare always produced casualties, yet 

never on this scale—and never delivered such images directly to the public.  An 1862 

21 Panzer, Mathew Brady and the Image of History, 109 

12 

New York Times review of Brady’s work at Antietam commented that war casualties 

appeared “like a funeral next door… We recognize the battle-field as a reality, but it 

stands as a remote one,” and “our sensations might be different if the newspaper carrier 

left the names on the battle-field and the bodies at our doors instead.”  The review 

continues to claim that Brady’s photographs did just this: “If he has not brought bodies 

and laid them in our door-yards and along the streets, he has done something very like 

it.”22 

These photographs captivated the public while war raged on, yet in the end 

contributed to a larger shift in American heroism during and after the Civil War.  By 

producing such images, Brady aided in the downfall of his old political “hero,” offering 

visualizations of the destruction which these politicians only temporarily evaded through 

compromise.  The post-war public, which five years earlier held such compromisers in 

great regard, saw such political tactics as a direct cause of the Civil War, and afterwards 

“their ideals of moderation and compromise inspired no one.”23  Brady offered images of 

a new hero to the American people: military leaders of Mexican War fame who firmly 

took sides on the secession issue and bravely fought for their beliefs.  The public 

voraciously consumed images of “the glamour and pomp of Scott and McClellan.”24  One 

reporter remarked that such military leaders “are as brilliant but as distant from us as 

planets; it is a pleasure to have these planets photographed and be upon whispering terms 

with the Generals who are now to the nation as gods.”25  But the war dragged on, and 

these majestic fighters met with little success, a new breed of military leaders took their 

place.  These men—men like Sherman and Grant—provided the tactics and force 

22 Ibid., p. 106-107

13 

required to bring about an end to the civil war.  Yet they were no heroes.  They won 

battles through “ruthlessness and efficiency,” and sacrificed great numbers of lives in the 

pursuit of victory.26  When war finally ended, the public was left with no true heroes who 

might stand up to the ideal heroism which America subscribed to before conflict broke 

out.  A new “hero” arose from the common, anonymous soldier.  These men represented, 

for post-war Americans, the only figures in the war not marred by playing a role in 

secession or directing the deaths of so many.  Brady’s work not only exposed the 

brutality of military leaders, but also supported this new private hero.  His photographs 

“allowed viewers to see the war through the eyes of their loved ones,”27 and provided 

images in which “the private soldier has just as good a likeness as the General.”28 

During the war, the photographs which facilitated changes in American heroism 

met with great success and increased Brady’s fame.  Images of battlefields, soldiers, and 

generals provided an exciting look into the conflict that words simply could not 

reproduce.  Landscapes supplied “a screen on which [viewers] could project a private 

version of the battle.”29  Even the photographs of dead produced a sense of wonder in the 

minds of people who knew casualties as lists of names and no more.   

Yet Brady fell from fame and fortune in the years after the Civil War ended.  He 

returned to his studios in New York expecting to amass a fortune on selling his Civil War 

collection, after which he could return to photographing the distinguished leaders of the 

day.  “For Brady and his generation, the nation’s past was still almost within reach of 

personal memory, and the future stretched ahead, a long, continuous procession of great 

men,” even though his own personal work helped destroy the foundations of this 

26 Ibid., p. 110 
27 Ibid., p. 110 
28 Ibid., p. 106 
29 Panzer, Mathew Brady and the Image of History, 109 

14 

“continuous procession.”30  The New York Times offered a more successful prediction, 

expecting Brady’s images to “make common mortals of many a… living idol.”31 

However, the use of Brady’s images as news reporting died with the war, and would only 

re-emerge as historically important documentation decades later.  In addition, the men 

returning home needed no reminder of their experiences: “the truth of the war was too 

much to bear for those who had suffered through those four horrible years.”32  The 

conditions in which Brady rose to fame involved a society willing to pay high prices for 

high quality photographs of political heroes.  War effectively destroyed the heroism in 

politics and offered no replacement—post-war Americans preferred photographs of 

family members to political heroes, and Brady could make no money in such an 

enterprise.  America now desired low cost, low quality personal photographs.  In the 

words of Rose Greenhow, a Confederate spy, the pre-war years seemed “to belong almost 

to another state of being,” than the post-war society.33  Brady fell into poverty under such 

conditions, and sacrificed much of his collection to fund the storage of what remained. 

Why was Brady able to follow the changing trends of heroism into the Civil War, 

yet unable to predict or prepare for the eventual destruction of the “hero” on which he 

built his fame?  Brady was reluctant to sacrifice the belief that a “continuous procession 

of great men” would stretch out from the Civil War. 34  He obviously understood—as he 

struck off to photograph the war—that his beloved political heroes would give way to 

new definitions of heroism.  Yet his belief in photography as an art form, and his love for 

capturing the images of rich and famous Americans must have inflicted him with a

Brady’s  Civil  War  collection  remains  one  of  the  few  sources  of  images  relaying  the 
devastation  of  the  war.  While  the  photographs  of  fallen  soldiers  were  often  staged  by 
Brady’s  teams,  even  those  untouched  by  the  photographers  had  been  “posed”.    The 
bottom  photograph,  taken  after  the  battle  of Antietam,  is  one  of many  lines  of  dead men 
captured  on  film.    Note  the  visual  likeness  to  the  top  image,  a  photograph  of  officers 
observing  a  court martial  hearing.    But  the  posing  of  the  dead  in  the  bottom  photograph 
was  not  done  by  photographers—these  men  were  arranged  for  burial.  Brady 
photographed  battlefields  after  truces  between  opponents  allowed  for  the  burial  of  fallen 
men,  nearly  eliminating  the  chances  of  completely  untouched  scenes  of  death.    Image

stubborn blindness  to  the approaching elimination of his  trade.  How else could a man of 

such  insight  into  heroism  emerge  from  the  war  unable  to  remain  out  of  debt?   Perhaps 

Brady was simply unwilling  to give up his artistic pursuits  in conjunction with  the public 

desire  for  inexpensive  “portraits  for  their  family  albums,  showing  men  and  women  who 

inspired  more  private  memories.”35    He  felt  an  unexplainable  draw  to  historically 

significant  images,  and  “an  old  [photograph]  sent  home  by  a  soldier,  or  the  frank  charm 

of a picture of an actress,”36 hardly satisfied his understanding of the camera as “the eyes 

of  history.”  In  this  time where  photography  of  historical  importance  drifted  from  public 

interest, so did Brady “slip into quiet obscurity.”37 

Yet in some way this fall from fame represents no blindness or false judgment at 

all, but instead another stride in Brady’s attachment to the historical significance of his 

Civil War collection.  Just as he sacrificed his life and fortune to follow United States 

armies into battle against the Confederacy to collect photographs, Brady surrendered his 

chances at emerging from poverty for the protection of as much of his collection as 

possible.  He slowly auctioned off single negatives to fund the storage of those 

remaining, saving as many as he could until Congress eventually purchased what was left 

of the collection.38  Brady suffered ten years of poverty to preserve his precious historical 

photographs when he might have easily moved to other, more profitable measures and 

allowed his collection to fall into ruin.  While only a fraction of his original ten thousand 

photograph collection survived until the present, history owes a debt of gratitude to 

Brady: that any images survived is amazing, given the circumstances.

Mathew Brady quietly passed away in 1896, leaving the world in the same 

obscurity with which he entered.  For a brief period in history Brady enjoyed great fame 

that he sacrificed in the pursuit of his desire to photograph the Civil War.  But Brady’s 

intuition into the historical importance of photography, while providing his eventual 

demise, cemented his position as a great historical figure.  His images expose the horrific 

violence of the Civil War in a way with which words could not hope to compete.  

Furthermore, Brady’s rapid rise to fame before the war and even quicker fall after the 

conflict ended exposes much about the societal and political changes which the Civil War 

created in America.  An analysis of the work and life of Mathew Brady offers an 

interesting, original view of a traumatic time in American history.  While Brady’s 

photographs provide direct images of moments in time, his life exposes a grander image 

of the entire historical period in which he lived.
