AMERICAN CLASSICS: Suggestions on Paper Topics.  Spring 2006. 
 
The final obligation in this subject is the preparation of a final paper, about 10 pages in 
length, “on a notable historical work that was not assigned as required reading,” as the 
syllabus puts it.  The paper can, however, take a work that was assigned as required 
reading and examine it in a different way, using sources beyond those assigned.  For 
example, Frederick Douglass wrote three autobiographies, of which we read only the 
first.    Students could look at the other two and compare them, or perhaps compare those 
parts of them that addressed the same or similar topics. 
 
We did not read The Federalist Papers, which surely are an “American Classic.”   Often it 
is treated as an official manual on the Constitution.  In fact, the Federalist Papers were 
originally newspaper essays written to defend the Constitution against its critics during 
the ratification controversy.  The Constitution’s critics also wrote notable essays, and 
sometimes they’re more fun.  Bernard Bailyn collected some of the more notable 
speeches, articles, and letters of the ratification controversy in The Debate over the 
Constitution (Library of America; New York, 1993).  Several other collections are 
available, too. 
 
Remember the story of Washington and the cherry tree?  It comes from Mason Weems’s 
Life of Washington, first published around 1800 and reprinted, with an introduction by 
Marcus Cunliffe, by the Harvard University Press.  Weems’s book was overtop: it 
repeated anecdotes more to teach readers moral or political “lessons” than to recover 
Washington’s life, and it made Washington a figure like Moses or Christ (depending on 
which passages you consider).  But this is where the adoration of the founders started.  
And parts made their way into the schoolbook McGuthrie’s Reader---another good topic 
for a paper.  
 
This year some of Lincoln speeches beyond the Lincoln-Douglas debates were listed on 
the syllabus, but we had little time to discuss them.  So I think students could write on 
Lincoln---his oratory, and the development of his message, for example, in the course of 
the Civil War.  Someone wrote an entire book on the Second Inaugural.  And how much 
has been written on the Gettysburg Address?  Surely there’s a paper in there. 
 
Skipping to the late 19th century, Jane Addams, Forty Years at Hull House (orig. 1910) 
on her experiences in a settlement house (which offered services to immigrants), or Jacob 
Riis, How the Other Half Lives (1890) on the lives of the poor in American cities.  Riis 
was himself an immigrant, but from Denmark, not southern or eastern Europe, which 
produced the mass of immigrants of the time.  He was also a photographer.  Or Edward 
Bellamy’s Looking Backward, 2000-1887 (1888), which predicted what the United States 
would look like in 2000!  Similarly, a Populist named Ignatius Donnelly published 
Caesar’s Column in 1890 that purported to describe New York city in 1988 with its 
oppressive conspicuous wealth, its insurgent workers….  But then you might prefer to 
write on L. Frank Baum’s The Wizard of Oz (1900)---no, not the movie, though you 
could do both.  Baum’s book is available on the internet:

Have a look at the introduction.  Some say it was a contemporary political allegory, not 
just the “modernized fairy tale” Baum said he was producing. 
 
The spring 2006 rendition of AMERICAN CLASSICS is a bit light on the 20th century.  
You can make up for that with your paper.  There are more possibilities than I can begin 
to list.  You might, for example, like Helen Keller’s The Story of My Life (orig. 1903).  
You could examine and write on the Depression era photographs of Dorthea Lange (or, 
earlier, Mathew Brady’s Civil War photographs), though we have confined ourselves 
largely to works in words.  You could write on Margaret Mitchell’s Gone with the Wind 
(1936)---and/or the movie of three years later, although both are gargantuan.  Have you 
ever wanted to read Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring (1962)?  A 40th anniversary edition 
was published in 2002.  The 1960s also produced a rash of landmark books by black 
Americans. Another of an earlier time, The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (1912) 
by James Weldon Johnson, is in Three Negro Classics.   
 
The possibilities are almost endless.  The examples mentioned here are to get you 
thinking.   A good topic for a paper must be 1) a work that has attracted considerable 
attention or had a notable impact and 2) provides an interesting vantage point on the time 
it was produced or perhaps on the author, if he or she is independently interesting.  Most 
appropriate topics are works of nonfiction: novels are studied intensively in other 
subjects.  That’s not to say The Great Gatsby isn’t worth reading historically, but you’ve 
probably read it already.  The same is true of Huckleberry Finn.  Johnson’s 
Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man is a novel, but I don’t think you’ll find it in many 
American literature courses; its interest is largely historical.   The same is true of Gone 
with the Wind.  In short, find a work that interests you, that has historical interest, and 
that you haven’t already read.  And, assuming the topic isn’t on this list, check it out with 
the instructor.
