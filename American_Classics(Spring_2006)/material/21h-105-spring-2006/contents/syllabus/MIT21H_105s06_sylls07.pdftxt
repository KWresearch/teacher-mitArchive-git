21H.105.  AMERICAN CLASSICS.  Spring 2007. Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2-3:30.
Instructor: Prof. Pauline Maier. 
  
Course Description:   
This subject is devoted to reading and discussing basic American historical texts 
that are often cited but often remain unread, understanding their meaning, and assessing 
their continuing significance in American culture.  Since it is a "Communications 
Intensive" subject, 21H.105 is also dedicated to improving students' capacities to write 
and speak publicly.  It requires a substantial amount of writing, participation in 
discussions, and individual presentations to the class. 
 
Requirements:  
1) Regular attendance, completion of readings, and participation in discussions.  
This constitutes a significant component of students' performances in the subject. 
2) Completion of three papers of 4 to 5 pages based on the readings assigned for a 
specific week.  Students will be divided into three groups.  The members of each group 
will submit three papers, due at three-week intervals during the early part of the term.  
The papers of group I will be due on weeks 2, 5, and 8; of group II on weeks 3, 6, and 9; 
of group III on weeks 4, 7, and 11 (because there’s no reading for week 10).  Papers must 
be turned in at the Tuesday class in the week when they fall due.  (On week 3, when there 
is no Tuesday class, students should submit papers electronically if possible so they can 
remain on the same writing and revision schedule.)  Papers are usually returned on 
Thursday, and those students asked to rewrite the papers should see the writing tutor as 
soon as possible thereafter.  Rewrites must submitted within two weeks, i.e. no later than 
the week before the next paper is due. 
Students sometimes find that they have a paper due in 21H.105 just when they 
have heavy obligations in other subjects.  They can, of course, prepare their papers ahead 
of time.  They can also exchange places with students in other groups.  Such 
arrangements must, however, be announced to the instructor before the week in which the 
first paper is due, and they last for only one cycle. 
3) On the Tuesday of the week in which students have papers due they make a 
brief presentation to the class on the subjects of their papers.  During the final weeks of 
the term, when students are no longer obliged to write papers on the assigned readings, 
these presentations will continue.  That is, students in group 1 should be prepared to 
speak about the readings on May 1; group 2 on May 8, and group 3 on May 15.  In some 
cases the format for those classes might be changed, however. 
4) Preparation of a final paper, roughly 10 pages in length, on a notable historical 
work that was not assigned as required reading.  A list of possible topics will be provided, 
but students can propose others not on the list.  However, topics not on the suggested list 
must be approved by the instructor.  Students will be asked to submit their topics in the 
class on April 12, and the topics will be discussed in class on April 18.  The paper is due 
at the final meeting of the class on May 17. 
ALL papers must be double-spaced, written in clear and correct English, and 
identify the source and page numbers of all direct quotations.  Final papers must include 
footnotes or endnotes (or, where citations are drawn entirely or predominately from a 

 

3

single text, page citations within the text) and a bibliography.  There will be no final 
examination. 
Readings: 
 
Most readings are available in paperback books.  Others are accessible as 
electronic reserves, on the 21H.105 course website.  Those paperbacks ordered for 
purchase are designated below by an asterisk. 
 
Week 1.  Feb. 6- 8.  Introduction; the Puritans. 
 
John Winthrop, "A Modell of Christian Charity," a sermon of 1630, from Perry 
Miller and Thomas H. Johnson, eds., The Puritans: A Sourcebook of Their Writings,  I 
(rev. ed.; New York, 1963), 194-99. 
 
William Bradford, Of Plymouth Plantation, 1620-1647, esp. chapters 4 and 9, pp. 
23-27 and 58-63 in the edition edited by Samuel Eliot Morison (New York, 1979), which 
has adapted the language for modern readers (see his comments on this and on Bradford's 
history, pp. vii-xii). 
 
Week 2.  Feb. 13-15.  "The First Famous American": Benjamin Franklin.
* 
Franklin, The Autobiography and Other Writings.  Bantam Classic paperback  
(ISBN 0-553-21075-0), vii-xiii, 3-230, 270. 
 
NOTE: Discussion will focus particularly on Franklin's autobiography, but not all 
parts of it are worth equal attention.   Sections toward the end that describe in detail 
Pennsylvania politics and the Seven Years War need not be followed closely, but note pp. 
108, 111-19, and 150-51. 
 
Tuesday, February 20: Monday Schedule. 
 
Week 3.  Feb. 22.  Paine's "Common Sense" and the Declaration of Independence.  
* 
Thomas Paine, Common Sense and Related Writings, Dover Thrift edition (ISBN 
0-486-29602-4). 
 
The George Mason draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights as it appeared in 
the Pennsylvania Gazette, June 12, 1776. 
The committee or "Jefferson" draft of the Declaration of Independence, with 
Congress's editings (June -July 1776). 
 
Week 4.  Feb. 27- March 1.  The Constitutional Convention.  
* 
Adrienne Koch, ed., Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787 
Reported by James Madison.  The Norton Library (ISBN 0393304051).  Start wit the 
Introduction, Madison's preface, and  pp. 21- 166.  This includes the convention's 
opening; the presentation of the Virginia plan, and the delegates’ consideration of its 
provisions while acting as a Committee of the Whole, including the presentation and 
rejection of the alternative New Jersey plan.  On June 19 the Committee of the Whole 
reported the convention (i.e.the same delegates wearing different hats) the resolutions on 
pp. 148-51, which the meeting proceeded to discuss---again---in its official capacity as a 
convention.  (Note how the designation for June 20 differs from that of June 19, i.e. “IN 
CONVENTION” rather than “IN COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE.”)  Skim the make-
or-break debates on resolutions 7 and 8 that runs from pp. 220-98, with the little 

 

4

additional flare-up on 299-302.  Thereafter, debates proceeded with less fireworks, and 
you can pick and choose which issues to follow.  Discussion over whether Congress 
should veto state laws, as Madison insisted, is on 304-05; debates over the presidency, 
which many said was the hardest issue the convention faced, are on pp. 306-14, 322-35, 
356-72.  As a result of these discussions, the convention produced a revised set of 
resolutions (pp. 379-85), which a Committee of Detail made into a draft constitution 
while the convention adjourned from July 26-August 6 (see pp. 385-96).  Then the 
convention debated the draft, revisiting issues it had decided earlier in the light of other 
decisions.  Note the predictions of the future that emerged during a discussion of 
suffrage, pp. 402-04; and the discussions of slavery and the slave trade on pp. 409-13, 
502-08.  In late August the convention set up a Committee of Eleven to propose solutions 
to several problems it hadn't solved.  The committee's recommendations opened another 
round of debates, especially on the executive (see 573-79, 582-97, and 605-66 on 
impeachment).  Finally, on September 12, a Committee of Style set up to incorporate 
changes into the draft constitution and refine its wording presented its report (616-27).  
That led to what was, in effect, the delegates’ fourth time through the plan of government 
(i.e. the first was the Committee of the Whole’s consideration of the Virginia resolutions, 
to June 19; the second was the convention’s consideration of the resolutions from the 
Committee of the Whole, from June 19 to July 26; the third was the convention’s debates 
on the draft Constitution produced by the Committee of Detail, August 6- September 12, 
and the fourth its debates on the polished Constitution proposed by the Committee of 
Style, September 12-17).  In this final phase, George Mason raised the issue of a bill of 
rights (630).  Read also the record of the convention's closing days, 650-59. 
 
Friday, March 2: Possible optional tour of the Lewis and Clark exhibit at Harvard’s 
Peabody Museum. 
 
Week 5. March 6-8.  Exploring the West. 
Jefferson’s instructions to Capt. Meriwether Lewis, June 20, 1803, available at: 
http://www.mt.net/~rojomo/landc.htm and also (in a somewhat better format) 
http://www.library.csi.cuny.edu/dept/history/lavender/jefflett.html
* 
Gary E. Moulton, ed., The Lewis and Clark Journals; University of Nebraska 
Press pb. (ISBN0-8032-8039-4)  Read the preface, introduction, “editorial principles,” 
and afterword.  Feel free to skim, and don't be surprised if it takes some time to get into 
the story.  There are memorable passages in the book, which tells the tale of a great 
adventure and a lot about the country and its peoples at that time, but the "good parts" are 
scattered, which makes it difficult to define just which pages to read.   
This edition provides an extensive introduction, which should make navigating 
the journals easier.  However, papers should be based on the journals themselves, not 
those parts supplied by the editor. 
 
Week 6.  March 13-15.  Slave Narratives: Frederick Douglass and/or Harriet Jacobs. 
You have a choice:: 
Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass…, with an introduction by David 
* 
Blight. Bedford/St. Martins paperback, 2nd edition (2002). ISBN: 0312257376.  Read the 
introduction and supplementary documents as well as the autobiography.

OR 
 
* 
Harriet Jacobs, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Signet Classes paperback.  
ISBN: 0451527526.  If you choose Jacobs, read also Douglass’s speech, “What to the 
Slave is the Fourth of July,” available at: 
http://douglassarchives.org/doug_a10.htm
  
Week 7. March 20-22.  "The Little Lady Who Caused This Big War." 
* 
Harriet Beecher Stowe, Uncle Tom's Cabin.  Penguin Classics pb. (ISBN 
0140390030)  This is a long book, but it's easy reading.  Start early. 
 
March 27-28: Spring Vacation. 
 
Week 8.  April 3-5.  The Lincoln-Douglas Debates; Lincoln. 
Lincoln’s “House Divided” speech at Springfield, June 16, 1858, when he 
accepted the Republicans’ nomination for senator (read this before reading the Lincoln-
Douglas debates), his First Inaugural (1861), the Gettysburg Address (1863), and his 
Second Inaugural Address (1865),  reliable versions of which are available at 
http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/speech.htm
* 
Harry Holzer, ed., The Lincoln-Douglas Debates: The First Complete, 
Unexpurgated Text (Fordham University Press paperback; ISBN 0-8232-2342-6).  Read 
the Preface, Introduction, descriptions of “the scene” for each of the debates, all of which 
were held in 1858, and the appendix as well as the debates themselves, much of which 
you can skim.  The speeches are long, but include many repetitions since the speakers 
went over the same issues, sometimes reading passages from previous speeches, again 
and again.  Much of the content was pretty well established after the first three debates, 
but it’s useful to ask who you think came out best in the various debates, and, more 
important, whether the speakers' positions changed.  For example, does Lincoln state his 
position differently in Ottawa and Freeport, in the northern part of Illinois, which was 
settled by migrants from free states, than in Charleston or Alton, which were settled by 
people from the South who were in general more pro-slavery?  As this edition (do not 
accept substitutes!) makes clear, the debates took place outside, without microphones, to 
audiences that often interrupted the speakers.  Even the audience’s interjections and the 
speakers’ responses, which Holzer scrupulously includes, are interesting. 
 
Week 9.  April 10-12. Ulysses S. Grant and the Civil War. 
* 
U. S. Grant, Personal Memoirs,  Penguin pb. (ISBN 0140437010), esp. pp. xiii-
xxvi, 3-54, 92-133, read about some battle of the Civil War (Shiloh, 177-99, for example; 
Vicksburg was more important, but the account is also much longer), 376-82, 525 
(bottom) -35, 558-61, 580-640. 
 
Tuesday, April 17: Patriot's Day Holiday; no class.
