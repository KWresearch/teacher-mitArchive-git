***** Course Requirements *****
**** Attendance and Participation ****
Regular attendance, completion of readings, and participation in discussions is
required. This constitutes a significant component of students' performances in
the subject.
**** Assignments ****
Students are expected to complete three papers of 4 to 5 pages based on the
readings assigned for a specific week. Students will be divided into three
groups. Additional details can be found in the assignments section.
**** Oral Presentations ****
On the first session of the week in which students have papers due they each
present to the class a brief summary of their papers. During the final weeks of
the term, when students are no longer obliged to write papers on the assigned
readings, these presentations will continue. That is, students in group 1
should be prepared to speak about the readings in first session of Week# 12;
group 2 in first session of Week# 13, and group 3 in first session of Week# 14.
In some cases the format for those classes might be changed, however.
**** Final Paper ****
Preparation of a final paper, roughly 10 pages in length, on a notable
historical work that was not assigned as required reading. Additional details
are available in the assignments section.
There will be no final examination.
