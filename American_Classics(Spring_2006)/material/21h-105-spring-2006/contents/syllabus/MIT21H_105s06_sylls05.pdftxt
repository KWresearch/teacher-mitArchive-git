21H105.  AMERICAN CLASSICS.  Spring 2005.  1-2:30. 
Instructor: Prof. Pauline Maier 
 
Course Description:   
This subject is devoted to reading and discussing basic American historical texts 
that are often cited but often remain unread, understanding their meaning, and assessing 
their continuing significance in American culture.  Since it is a "Communications 
Intensive" subject, 21H105 is also dedicated to improving students' capacities to write 
and speak well.  It requires a substantial amount of writing, participation in discussions, 
and individual presentations to the class. 
 
Requirements:  
1) Regular attendance, completion of readings, and participation in discussions.  
This constitutes a significant component of students' performances in the subject. 
2) Completion of three papers of 4 to 5 pages based on the readings assigned for a 
specific week.  Students will be divided into three groups.  The members of each group 
will submit three papers, due at three-week intervals during the early part of the term.  
The papers of group I will be due on weeks 2, 5, and 8; of group II on weeks 3, 6, and 9; 
of group III on weeks 4, 7, and 10.  Papers must be turned in at the Tuesday class in the 
week when they fall due.  However, in weeks when there is no Tuesday class (February 
22 and April 19), they can be turned in on Thursday.  Papers are usually graded and 
returned on Thursday, and those students asked to rewrite the papers see the writing tutor 
on Friday.  Rewrites need to be done quickly, normally before two weeks have passed, 
and in any case before the next paper is due. 
Students sometimes find that they have a paper due in 21H105 just when they 
have heavy obligations in other subjects.  They can, of course, prepare their papers ahead 
of time.  They can also exchange places with students in other groups.  Such 
arrangements must, however, be announced to the instructor before the week in which the 
first paper is due, and they last for only one cycle. 
3) On the Tuesday of the week in which students have papers due they each 
present to the class a brief summary of their papers.  During the final weeks of the term, 
when students are no longer obliged to write papers on the assigned readings, these 
presentations will continue.  That is, students in group 1 will give brief presentations on 
the readings for the week on April 26; group 2 on May 3, and group 3 on May 10.  In 
some cases the format might be changed into a panel discussion. 
4) Preparation of a final paper, roughly 10 pages in length, on a notable historical 
work that was not assigned as required reading.  A list of possible topics will be provided, 
but students can propose others not on the list.  However, topics not on the suggested list 
must be approved by the instructor on or before April 12, which is a month before the 
final meeting of the class on May 12, when the paper is due. 
ALL papers must be double-spaced, written in clear and correct English, and 
identify the source and page numbers of all direct quotations.  Final papers must include 
footnotes or endnotes (or, where citations are drawn entirely or predominately from a 
single text, page citations within the text) and a bibliography. 
There will be no final examination.

Readings: 
 
Most readings are available in paperback books.  Others are accessible on the 
Internet, and those that cannot be so accessed will be collected in a course packet at the 
Humanities Reserve Room from which students can make Xeroxed copies for their 
personal use.  Those paperbacks ordered for purchase are designated below by an 
asterisk. 
 
Week 1.  Feb. 1-3.  Introduction; the Puritans. 
John Winthrop, "A Modell of Christian Charity," a sermon of 1630. 
 
 
William Bradford, Of Plymouth Plantation, 1620-1647, esp. chapters 4 and 9, pp. 
23-27 and 58-63 in the edition edited by Samuel Eliot Morison (New York, 1979), which 
has adapted the language for modern readers (see his comments on this and on Bradford's 
history, pp. vii-xii). 
 
Week 2.  Feb. 8-10.  "The First Famous American": Benjamin Franklin.
* 
Franklin, The Autobiography and Other Writings.  Bantam Classic paperback  
(ISBN 0-553-21075-0), vii-xiii, 3-230, 270. 
 
NOTE: Discussion will focus particularly on Franklin's autobiography, but not all 
parts of it are worth equal attention.   Sections toward the end that describe in detail 
Pennsylvania politics and the Seven Years War need not be followed closely, but note pp. 
108, 111-19, and 150-51. 
 
Week 3.  Feb. 15-17.  The Constitutional Convention.  
* 
Adrienne Koch, ed., Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787 
Reported by James Madison.  The Norton Library (ISBN 0393304051).  Introduction, 
Madison's preface, pp. 21- 166, and some of the subsequent pages described below.  The 
opening section includes the convention's opening; presentation of the Virginia plan; 
presentation and rejection of the alternative New Jersey plan; and resumption of debate 
based on the resolutions Virginia had proposed.  Note the resolutions on pp. 148-51, 
since the debates immediately thereafter are keyed to them.  Skim the make-or-break 
debates on resolutions 7 and 8 that runs from pp. 220-98, with the little additional flare-
up on 299-302.  Thereafter, debates proceeded with less fireworks, and you can pick and 
choose which issues to follow.  Discussion over whether Congress should veto state laws, 
as Madison insisted, is on 304-05; debates over the presidency, which many said was the 
hardest issue the convention faced, are on pp. 306-14, 322-35, 356-72.   
As a result of these discussions, the convention produced a revised set of 
resolutions (pp. 379-85), which a Committee of Detail made into a draft constitution 
while the convention adjourned from July 26-August 6 (see pp. 385-96).  Then the 
delegates went over the draft, revisiting issues it had discussed before in the light of other 
decisions.  Note predictions of the future that emerged during a discussion of suffrage, 
pp. 402-04; and discussions of slavery and the slave trade on pp. 409-13, 502-08.  In late 
August the convention set up a Committee of Eleven to propose solutions to several 
problems it hadn't solved.  The committee's recommendations opened another round of 
debates, especially on the executive (see 573-79, 582-97, and 605-66 on impeachment). 
Finally, on September 12, a Committee of Style, which had been asked to 
incorporate changes into the draft constitution and refine its wording, presented its report

(616-27).  That led to still more debates, in the course of which George Mason raised the 
issue of a bill of rights (630).  Read also the record of the convention's closing days, 650-
59. 

 
Tuesday, February 22: Monday Schedule. 
 
Week 4.  Feb. 24.  .  Paine's "Common Sense" and the Declaration of Independence.  
Thomas Paine, Common Sense and Related Writings, Dover Thrift edition (ISBN 
* 
0-486-29602-4). 
 
The George Mason draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights as it appeared in 
the Pennsylvania Gazette, June 11, 1776. 
The committee or "Jefferson" draft of the Declaration of Independence, with 
Congress's editings (June -July 1776). 
 
Week 5. March 1-3.  Exploring the West. 
* 
Gary E. Moulton, ed., The Lewis and Clark Journals; University of Nebraska 
Press pb. (ISBN0-8032-8039-4)  Read the preface, introduction, “editorial principles,” 
and afterword.  Of the actual journals, students in previous years---who used a different 
edition (the Moulton abridgement was first published in 2003)--- gave the following 
advice:  Feel free to skim, and don't be surprised if it takes awhile to get into the story.  
Long entries are generally more worthwhile than short ones.  There are memorable 
passages in the book, which tells the tale of a great adventure and a lot about the country 
and its peoples at that time, but the "good parts" are scattered, which makes it difficult to 
define just which pages to read.   
This edition provides an extensive introduction, which should make navigating 
the journals easier.  However, papers should be based on the journals themselves, not 
those parts supplied by the editor. 
 
Week 6.  March 8-10.  Frederick Douglass; Abolitionism. 
Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave, Written by 
* 
Himself.  Dover Thrift edition (ISBN 0486284999).  
 
William Lloyd Garrison, The Liberator, first issue, January 1, 1831, at 
http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=576
and “On the Constitution and the Union,” December 29, 1832, at 
http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=570
 
Also, start Stowe. 
 
Week 7. March 15-17.  "The Little Lady Who Caused This Big War." 
* 
Harriet Beecher Stowe, Uncle Tom's Cabin.  Penguin Classics pb. (ISBN 
0140390030)  This is a long book, but it's easy reading; start early. 
 
March 21-25: Spring Vacation. 
 
Week 8.  March 29-31.  The Lincoln-Douglas Debates; Lincoln.

* 
Harry Holzer, ed., The Lincoln-Douglas Debates: The First Complete, 
Unexpurgated Text (Fordham University Press; New York, 2004 [lst ed. 1993])  ISBN 0-
8232-2342-6.  Read the Preface, Introduction, descriptions of “the scene” for each of the 
debates, and the appendix as well as the debates themselves, much of which you can 
skim.  The speeches are long, but include many redundancies since the speakers went 
over the same issues, sometimes reading passages from previous speeches, again and 
again.  The debates’ contents was pretty well established after the first three debates, but 
it’s useful to ask who you think came out best in the various debates, and, more 
important, whether the speakers' positions changed.  For example, does Lincoln state his 
position differently in Ottawa and Freeport, in the northern part of Illinois, settled by 
migrants from free states, than in Charleston or Alton, settled by people from the South 
who were in general more pro-slavery?  As this edition (do not accept substitutes!) makes 
clear, the debates took place outside, without microphones, to audiences that often 
interrupted the speakers.  Even their interjections, which Holzer scrupulously includes, 
are interesting.  
Also read Lincoln’s “House Divided” speech at Springfield, June 16, 1858, when 
he accepted the Republicans’ nomination for senator (you should probably read this 
before reading the Lincoln-Douglas debates), his First Inaugural (1861), the Gettysburg 
Address (1863), and his Second Inaugural Address (1865),  reliable versions of which are 
available at http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/speech.htm
 
Week 9.  April 5-7. Ulysses S. Grant and the Civil War.

xxvi, 3-54, 92-133, read about some battle of the Civil War (Shiloh, 177-99, for example; 
Vicksburg was more important, but the account is also much longer), 376-82, 525 
(bottom) -35, 558-61, 580-640. 
 
Week 10.  April 12-14.  Making Money---and Giving it Away. 
(Review Franklin, "The Way to Wealth," in Autobiography and Other Writings,
