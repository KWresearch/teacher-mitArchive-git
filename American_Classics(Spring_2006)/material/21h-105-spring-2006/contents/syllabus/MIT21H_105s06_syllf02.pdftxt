Professor Christopher Capozzola 
 
Fall 2002 
 
“What then is the American, this new man?” asked J. Hector St-John de Crèvecoeur in his Letters from an 
American Farmer in 1782. This subject takes Crèvecoeur’s question as the starting point for an 
examination of the changing meanings of national identity in the American past. We will consider a 
diverse collection of classic texts in American history to see how Americans have defined themselves and 
their nation in politics, literature, art, and popular culture. As a communications-intensive subject, 
students will be expected to engage intensively with the material through frequent oral and written 
exercises. 
 
Requirements: The success of this class depends on the active participation of all students. Classroom 
participation (20%) represents a substantial portion of the grade, and will be evaluated in terms of 
preparation, participation in large and small group discussion, active listening, collaboration, and overall 
contributions to the class experience during the term. Needless to say, if you do not attend a class it is 
impossible for you to contribute to it. All students will do a short presentation (10%) about a document 
that you find that relates to the readings for a particular class. Signups will follow. 
 
Writing assignments in this subject are frequent. Everyone will write three 3-5pp. essays (15% each), of 
which at least one must be revised. In addition, each student will write a longer 8-10pp. essay (20%) on 
an additional work or works not on the syllabus. Various preparatory writing exercises (5%) will help 
students develop a topic, a bibliography, and an argument in advance of the final paper itself. 
 
Writing assignments are due on paper in person at the beginning of the class in which they are due. 
Extensions will be granted only for good reasons explained well in advance; computer malfunctions are 
never an acceptable excuse for a late submission. Adherence to standards of academic honesty is required; 
if you have any questions about how to go about your writing or cite your sources, don’t hesitate to ask. 
 
Books: Required books are available at the MIT Bookstore. Additional copies of all books have also been 
placed on reserve in the Humanities Library. A number of readings will also be made available through 
the library’s electronic reserve system (accessible through the class website) or by handout. Readings 
should be completed by the beginning of the class under which they appear, unless otherwise stated.
