***** Course Description *****
This subject is devoted to reading and discussing basic American historical
texts that are often cited but often remain unread, understanding their
meaning, and assessing their continuing significance in American culture. Since
it is a "Communications Intensive" subject, 21H.105 is also dedicated to
improving students' capacities to write and speak well. It requires a
substantial amount of writing, participation in discussions, and individual
presentations to the class.
