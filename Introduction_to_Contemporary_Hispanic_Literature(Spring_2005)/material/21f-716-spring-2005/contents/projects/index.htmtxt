***** Teaching Groups *****
Each student will participate in a teaching group. The group will be
responsible for generating thought questions to guide the class reading of the
text at hand before that work is assigned. Students will have access to the
archive of El PaÃ­s and can use the newspaper, books, journals, and on-line
materials for presentations. In addition, the teaching group will lead
discussion for that particular class. I will meet with the group to discuss the
presentation before it is given. Power point presentations are often
interesting to the class. If you use slides or any information from the
internet, be sure to acknowledge your sources.
***** Student Presentations *****
During the spring of 2005, student presentations were recorded especially for
OpenCourseWare. Below are links to the videos.Â  TheÂ video in this section
