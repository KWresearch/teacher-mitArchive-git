Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session
***** Prerequisite *****
MIT students are required to get the permission of the instructor.Â  No prior
training or experience in physical planning or urban design is assumed,
although it is advantageous. Some exposure to imaging software and Geographic
Information System (GIS) is helpful.
***** The "Envisioning Needham Street" Plan *****
The City of Newton's Department of Planning and Development has engaged the
Community Growth and Land-Use Planning course of MIT (11.360) to envision
redevelopment along the Needham Street Corridor and recommend implementation
strategies to make the plan a reality. As a gateway to the city of Newton,
Needham Street has the potential to be an inviting place that encourages people
to work, shop, enjoy civic interaction, and live. The city is interested in
reconstructing the street in the near future, and the project with MIT is
designed to assist in improving its appearance and transportation options, and
inspire economic development.
***** Course Overview *****
This subject explores the techniques, processes, and personal and professional
skills required to effectively manage growth and land use change. While
primarily focused on the planning practice in the United States, the principles
and techniques reviewed and presented may have international application. This
course is not for bystanders; it is designed for those who wish to become
actively involved or exposed to the planning discipline and profession as it is
practiced today, and as it may need to be practiced in the future.
The fundamentals of the land use planning and growth management system are
explored. Discussion and review of both traditional and innovative approaches
to land use planning and growth management will occur, with emphasis on
participatory processes and performance-based systems. Examples of the tools
and techniques utilized at the local, regional, and state level of government
will also be presented and evaluated.
A major focus of the course involves student work on a client-based land use
planning project in Newton, Massachusetts. The project will enable students to
draw upon and apply a variety of approaches and interventions explored in the
course and readings.
***** Format *****
Class sessions employ lectures, discussions of readings, case materials, role-
playing exercises, and student presentations. Readings include journal
articles, papers, and other written works relevant to contemporary planning
practice and the evolution of the discipline. These readings supplement class
session topics and discussion. Where appropriate to specific topics, guest
speakers will present to the class and join in class discussion. There is no
final examination required for completion of the course. In addition to
classwork, each student will be required to participate, as a project team
member, in the preparation of a project for an actual client.
***** Evaluation *****
Student evaluations will be principally based upon contributions to the
community planning project, including the preparation of the final plan report,
participation in mid-term and final presentations of the plan to the client and
others, and submission of a short "synthesis paper" about the planning project.
Participation in class discussion will also be a significant factor in final
grade evaluations.
