The term 6.xxx is used in the syllabus to jointly refer to the undergraduate
(6.803) and graduate (6.833) versions of the course. A calendar of topics is
presented below.
***** Purpose *****
6.xxx is designed to help you learn about progress toward the scientific goal
of understanding human intelligence from a computational point of view. The
foundations for 6.xxx were developed by a group that styles itself as The_Human
Intelligence_Enterprise, from which this subject draws its name.
6.xxx complements 6.034, because 6.xxx focuses on long-standing scientific
questions, whereas 6.034 focuses on existing tools for building applications
with reasoning and learning capability.
***** Why You Should Take 6.xxx *****
    * You should take 6.xxx if you want to learn about the enterprise of
      explaining intelligence from a computational point of view. When you have
      finished the subject, you will understand the powerful ideas behind an
      optimistic view of what will be discovered in the next decade.
    * You should take 6.xxx if you want to develop a foundation for making
      personal contributions toward reaching the goal of understanding
      intelligence. When you have finished the subject, you will know about
      intriguing ideas begging for extension.
    * You should take 6.xxx if you want to learn how to dig the salient ideas
      out of a research paper without distraction by minutiae. When you have
      finished the subject, you will have learned to identify big ideas and
      ignore detritus.
    * You should take 6.xxx if you want to learn to present complex ideas
      effectively, as if you were presenting a thesis, delivering a job talk,
      chatting with a high-ranking official at breakfast, or making a
      presentation to a potential customer or venture capitalist. When you have
      finished the subject, you will have learned about heuristics that will
      improve your ability to do all these.
***** Why 6.xxx can be Viewed as a Humanities Subject *****
    * 6.xxx is about computational theories of human thinking. Hence, 6.xxx can
      be viewed as a special kind of psychology subject.
    * 6.xxx is about ferreting big ideas out of original sources through
      thoughtful reading, writing, and discussion. Hence, 6.xxx can be viewed
      as a special kind of literature subject.
    * 6.xxx is about packaging ideas into a variety of formats, including
      abstracts, conclusions, slide shows, press releases, proposals, reports,
      letters, and conversation. Hence, 6.xxx can be viewed as a subject in
      communication.
    * 6.xxx is about how to empower ideas through a clear statement of vision,
      an enumeration of concrete steps toward the vision, an articulation of
      new results with clarifying details, and a statement of contributions.
      Hence, 6.xxx can be viewed as a subject in persuasion and leadership.
***** Why You Should Avoid 6.xxx *****
    * You should avoid 6.xxx unless you can commit to on-time attendance and
      committed reading.
Because of the emphasis on reading and discussion, and the limitation on
enrollment, regular attendance is obligatory, along with commitment to reading
the papers. If you cannot picture yourself in class at 9:30 am, every Monday
and Wednesday, you should not register, so as to make room for others who would
otherwise be excluded because of the enrollment limitation. A corollary is that
you probably should not register for 6.xxx if you are taking five subjects or
course equivalents, such as UROP. You definitely should not register if you are
involved in a startup or you are taking six or more subjects or subject
equivalents.
    * You should avoid 6.xxx if you are not interested in understanding human
      intelligence from a computational point of view.
Believing that both mind-stretching and near-miss learning are educationally
useful, some of the papers I have selected are boring, stupid, or nearly
unintelligible. One goal of the subject is to develop the skill of gleaning
useful ideas from such papers, but if you have little or no interest in
understanding human intelligence, you should not subject yourself to the
necessary reading. For more detail on what you will need to read, have a look
at the readings section.
    * You should avoid 6.xxx if you already know everything you need to know
      about communication.
About one-third of the subject is devoted to discussing how to package ideas
orally and in writing. You need to be enthusiastic about practicing the skills
taught with a positive attitude. For more detail on what will be covered in the
communication dimension, have a look at the assignments section.
    * You should avoid 6.xxx if you are enrolled in another limited-enrollment
      AI subject or an AI subject whose enrollment should be limited.
Alas, advanced AI subjects are scarce, and fairness dictates that they should
be offered as broadly as possible. This fairness goal must be balanced,
however, against the need to keep some of them small. If you are just generally
interested in AI, you should take one of the graduate lecture-based subjects.
***** Level *****
6.803 is the undergraduate version of 6.xxx, and 6.833 is the graduate version.
The two differ in that 6.833 may require you to attend some extra classes and
will require you to complete a substantial term project. Both meet together
ordinarily.
The graduate, H-level subject forms a bridge between 6.034 and design/project/
thesis work in Artificial Intelligence.
***** Content *****
The content of 6.xxx is largely based on papers identified in an informal
survey of representative AI leaders, who were asked what has most influenced
the way they think about human intelligence. The papers mentioned tend to fall
into the following categories, ranked by frequency:
    * Visionary Thinking by the Giants
    * Computational Models of Perception and Cognition
    * Powerful Computational Ideas
    * Neuroscience and Human Behavior
***** Style *****
    * You read parts or all of one or two papers for each class.
    * You discuss the content of those papers in class, occasionally with the
      authors.
The following mechanisms are used to ensure that you read the papers and absorb
the material:
    * Homework, consisting of either short answers to questions about the
      papers or the preparation of abstracts, slide shows, and other forms of
      communication.
    * Verbal questions, often asked of random students during class.
***** Limit on Enrollment *****
Because of the emphasis on reading, discussion, and presentation, enrollment is
limited.
***** Credit and Projects *****
Doing a substantial project is required for graduate H credit. More details are
available in the projects section.
Calendar
"Discussion" refers to the introductory first half hour of class that is spent
discussing communication heuristics.
