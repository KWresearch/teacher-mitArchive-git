Sample Projects from Previous Years 

Looking over my pile of past term projects, and picking a few, more or less at random, I 
see the following. The mere existence of a topic in the list does not, incidentally, prevent 
you from undertaking the same topic. No two people or groups will produce the same 
contributions, and yours might be much better.

Research proposal 

If we are to 
understand what we 
can communicate in 
language, we should 
understand what can 
be communicated in 
the languages of other 
animals. 

If we are to 
understand how we 
benefit from 
precedents, we first 
need to understand 
how to represent the 
knowledge conveyed 
in stories. 

If we are to 
understand the 
contribution of vision 
to describing 
trajectories, we must 
develop a 
representation capable 
of expressing what a 
vision system sees in 
terms of change and 
motion.

about chimp

Speculate on how well 
Borchardt's language 
would work as a 
representation for 
everyday stories of the 
sort that you would 
find in a child's reader. 

Speculate on how well 
Borchardt's language 
would work as a 
representation for 
visual events, such as 
size and position 
changes, so as to help 
enable the formation of 
hypothesis such as prey 
running away, person 
approaching, or wheel 
spinning.

system, we should 
develop an 
understanding of how 
people describe what 
they see. 

If we are to 
understand 
developmental 
phenomena, such as 
observed in Spelke's 
experiments, we must 
first learn how to 
describe those 
phenomena in a 
precise technical 
language. 

If we are to fully 
understand human 
communication, we 
have to understand 
not only emotion-
expressing body 
language, but also 
how we learn to 
express emotion in 
body language. 

learn to describe scenes 
consisting of a few 
geometric figures. 

Speculate on how 
Borchardt's or 
Jackendoff's language 
could help describe 
developmental 
phenomena, thereby 
more precisely 
cataloging what a 
developing child, at 
various stages, can 
know in terms of 
transition types or path 
types. 

Build on the work on 
the Kismet robot to 
understanding how 
emotional cues are 
learned. 

If we are to 
understand how our 
brains's various 
faculties work 
together, we have to 
understand how they 
learn to communicate. 

Blend the best of K-
lines and Kirby's 
survival-of-the-smallest 
idea to develop a 
theory of how our 
various faculties might 
learn to communicate. 

If we are to 
understand how 
language evolves, we 
need to experiment 
with systems such as 
Kirby's. 

Build a system that 
allows us to perform 
parameter-variation 
experiments; then, 
experiment.
