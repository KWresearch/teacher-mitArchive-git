Assignment: Endorsement Letter 

 
Paper  
Finlayson, Mark A., and Patrick H. Winston. “Analogical Retrieval via Intermediate 
Features: The Goldilocks Principle.” MIT CSAIL Technical Report 2006-071. 
Assignment  
On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following.  

Finlayson evidently believes that research on analogical reasoning is a sine qua non of 
any research enterprise focused on human intelligence.  

Part A  

You are Catherine Miller. Mark has asked you to evaluate his paper as if it were a 6.xxx 
assignment. Write the critique.  

Part B  

Finlayson has goaded his “supervisor,” Professor Winston, into submitting a proposal to 
the National Science Foundation for work on the next steps: matching promising 
precedents to situations of interest and then using the matched precedents to provide 
explanations or predictions. Again, they will focus on data sets describing various 
conflicts.  

They decide to solicit two letters of support, one from Dedre Gentner and one from 
Shimon Ullman. Both say they would be delighted to help, but, alas, each asks for talking 
points in the form of a draft letter.  

Supply the draft letters. So as to get everything in under the one-page limit, omit 
letterhead, date, salutation, closing, and signature, leaving only the letter bodies.
