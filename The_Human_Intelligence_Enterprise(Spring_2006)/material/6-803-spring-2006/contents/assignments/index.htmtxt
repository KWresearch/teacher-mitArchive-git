Communication assignment refers to the form that the student's written
assignment should take. For example, if the assignment refers to "press
release," the student's submission should be in the form of a press release.
Some of the assignments refer to "WRT," which stands for "Winston's Reading
Time." This refers to the length of time the professor needed to read the
paper, which students can use to estimate their reading time, once they have
calibrated themselves against the professor on the first few assignments.
