On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following.  

Part I  

Coen has applied for a faculty job at Carnegie-Mellon. Recently, after Winston made a 
phone call, he was invited to give a talk, which one Carnegie-Mellon faculty member 
characterized as the best faculty-candidate talk he had heard in a decade.  

Now the department chair wants letters of recommendation, and she has asked Winston 
to write one. He is busy beyond description, this being the end of the term, so he asks you 
to write up a draft.  

Supply the draft.  

Part II  

List a few questions to ask Coen in case he shows up at class.
