Assignment  
On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following.  

In yet another moment of temporary insanity, Winston has agreed to be the “respondent” 
to a talk given by John Laird at the 2nd Cognitive Systems Conference sponsored by 
DARPA in late May. Foolishly, he is listed as defending the “Core Competences” side of 
a debate in which Laird is defending the “General Purpose Architecture” side.  

Winston has no clue about what he will say, but the session chair has begged him to say 
things that will stimulate vigorous debate. No good being namby-pamby—potential 
sponsors will appear in abundance at the conference and real money is at stake.  

Having a few other things to do, Winston asks you for help because he knows you have 
had almost all of a 6.xxx experience. He asks you to first read the overview paper by 
Langley and Laird and the ACT paper by Anderson, and then to come up with some 
strategic and tactical talking points for him to use in the debate. His goal, of course, is to 
promote the work of people in the Genesis Group and other like-minded researchers, so 
he may end up wanting to cite various papers in the 6.xxx reading list.  

Prepare the required talking points.
