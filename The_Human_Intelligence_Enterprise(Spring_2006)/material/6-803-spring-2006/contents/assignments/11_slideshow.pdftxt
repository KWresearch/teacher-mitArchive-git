Paper  
Vaina, Lucia, and Richard Greenblatt. “The Use of Thread Memory in Amnesia Aphasia 
and Concept Learning.” AI Working Paper 195, Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1979. 

Be brief, but on this assignment, you are exempted from the one page requirement. 
If practicable, provide your slides two or three to the page.  

Where you think explanation for me is needed, of the sort you would provide orally 
in a talk, enclose what you write in parentheses.  

You may borrow freely from illustrations that appear in the paper. Do not fight with 
slide making software or fret about not having such software. You may cut and 
paste or roughly trace material from the paper or provide your own rough sketches 
of what you have in mind.  

•  Create about six key slides for this work, including the following:  
o  A slide labeled Vision (or Context).  
o  A slide labeled Key Example.  
o  A slide labeled Contributions.  
Identify and mark in your slides those elements that you think would best serve as 
the following:  
o  The slogan (handle, verbal)  
o  The symbol (handle, visual)  

• 

You may find what you want in the paper or you may have to invent what you 
need.  

• 

Identify in your slides or express in a sentence or two the following:  
o  The salient  
o  The surprise  

You may find what you want in the paper or you may have to invent what you 
need.  

Also, for classroom discussion, be prepared to explain how threads are similar to and 
different from ordinary property lists.
