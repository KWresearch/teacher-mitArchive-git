Papers  
Geiger, Gad, Jerome Y. Lettvin, and Olga Zegarra-Moran. “Task-determined strategies of 
visual process.” Cognitive Brain Research 1 (1992): 39-52. 

If you are interested in balancing your reading of the classic work by reading something 
recent, see the following:  

Geiger, Gad, and Jerome Y. Lettvin. “Developmental Dyslexia: a Different Perceptual 
Strategy and How to Learn a New Strategy for Reading.” Child Development and 
Disabilities 26, no. 1 (2000): 73-89.  
Assignment  
On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following.  

The subject of dyslexia turns up in a conversation you are having with friend who 
happens to be dyslexic. “Well,” says the friend, “I recently heard about an article 
appearing in that eminent scientific journal, The Boston Globe, that says MRI studies on 
dyslexics demonstrate that my brain is, regrettably, defective, and that accounts for my 
inability to read.”  

•  Having read the paper, write a letter to the scientists mentioned, commenting on 
the conclusions reached, based on what you have learned in Geiger's paper.  
•  Because you presume that the authors have not read the Geiger paper, include a 
VSN-C summary.  
•  Also, plainly state the goal you are trying to achieve in your letter.  
•  Circle and label the VSN-C and the goal. If you forget this step, you will be 
marched through building 10 in Winston's next dream.
