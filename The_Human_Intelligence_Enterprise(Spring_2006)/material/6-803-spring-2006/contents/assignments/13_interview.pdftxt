Prof. Patrick H. Winston 
Assignment: Interview 

Paper 
Hermer-Vazquez, Linda, Elizabeth Spelke, and Alla S. Katsnelson. “Sources of 
flexibility in human cognition: dual-task studies of space and language.” Cognitive 
Psychology 39 (1999): 3-36. 

WRT 1.5 hours  

You might also, for guidance in how to do the assignment, look at a 2050 interview with 
Sarah Winston, former President of the United States.  
Assignment  
On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following.  

You have a nightmare in which you have just landed a job as a reporter for Popular 
Psychology. Your boss has commanded that you interview Spelke for the next issue, but 
you learn that she is summering in a remote village in France. Eventually, you get 
through to her, but as she is about to dine, she declines to answer your questions. Instead, 
she asks you to draft up how you think she would respond to your questions. She will use 
your draft as a starting point for framing her own answers.  

•  Produce the requested interview. Be sure to cover V-S-N and contributions.  
In your interview, be sure to extract from Spelke a few words explaining in what 
• 
way humans are different from other animals.  
•  Also, as the interviewer, inject some comments of your own, in the form of a 
sidebar, speculating on how language facilitates thought from a computational 
point of view.  

When you think you are finished, go back over your report to be sure that you have 
provided a few interesting, specific details.
