Assignment: Cover Letter 

Paper  
Rao, Sajit. Visual Routines and Attention. PhD Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, 1998. 

Read what you need to answer the questions in the assignment.  
Assignment  
On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following.  

You are Rao. Since your graduate days, you have worked for a while in industry and you 
have worked on applied robotics research in Italy, but now you want to return to your 
true passion, science-side AI research, with Winston. You think it would a good idea to 
send Winston a copy of your thesis (he probably lost his copy when he moved from Tech 
Square) along with a cover letter to refresh his memory on what you accomplished in 
your thesis research.  

Construct a brief cover letter, including in it the following:  

•  Vision, step(s), and news.  
•  An enumeration of your contributions. In one of your items, include a word such 
as complement, contest, supersede, extend, refine, or support to explain the 
relation between your work and Ullman's and explain your word choice.  
•  An explanation of the extent to which your work is grounded, directly or 
indirectly, if at all, in system neuroscience and cognitive science.  

Also, separately but still on one page:  

•  A discussion of the influence of Winston and Brooks, as reflected in the first and 
final chapters, explaining which was written for Winston and which for Brooks.  
•  An explanation of which comes first in the first chapter: the discussion of 
motivation or the discussion of accomplishment? What is the principle danger 
associated with the order given?
