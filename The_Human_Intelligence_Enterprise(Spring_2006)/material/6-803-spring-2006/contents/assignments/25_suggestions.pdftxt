Assignment  
Option I  

Your assignment for the classes devoted to project presentations is to provide 
constructive advice to the presenters, using forms to be provided.  

Option II  

If you are unable to come to class, you are to prepare a comprehensive review of western 
thought, starting with Aristotle, clearly identifying the slogan and symbol best associated 
with each significant thinker, as well as a synopsis of that thinker's most salient ideas. 
Identify all surprizes and comment on whether the thinker's site was helpful in getting the 
message out.  

Option III  

If time permits, I may prepare another alternative for those who cannot come to class.
