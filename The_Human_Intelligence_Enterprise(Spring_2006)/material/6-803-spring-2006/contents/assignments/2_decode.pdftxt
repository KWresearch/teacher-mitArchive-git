Assignment: Paper Decoding 

Paper  
Turing, A. M. “Computing Machinery and Intelligence.” Mind 49: 433-460 (1950).  

WRT: 1.5 hours  
Assignment  
You are to limit your response to the questions posed in this assignment to one side of 
one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with reasonable interline spacing and 
margins.  

Note that there are two reasons we insist on the one-page limit.  

•  We want you to learn to be concise.  
•  We scan your papers before annotation for distribution and after annotation for 
posterity. Our scanner does not handle staples, nor does it handle two sides.  

Before you start writing, read the Style Guide carefully. We are very picky about the 
points listed, so you should review every paper you write to be sure that you have 
adhered to the commandments. Otherwise, you will drive us crazy with rage.  
Part I—Preparation  
Read the 6xxx style guide carefully. See the study materials section. 
Part II—Decoding a Paper  
Imagine that you have partied all weekend. 6.xxx is to meet in fifteen minutes, and you 
have not read the assigned paper yet. You are afraid Winston will call on you at random 
to summarize the important ideas. Explain how you would use your fifteen minutes to 
prepare for that possibility. Do not limit yourself to techniques suggested by the Turing 
paper.  
Part III—The Turing Paper  
Note: Turing's paper was originally published in 1950.

•  What question is Turing attempting to answer in his paper? How does he 
transform the question? Why?  
•  What is Turing's answer to his question? What is his prediction regarding the 
creation of intelligent machines? Was his prediction accurate? Why or why not?  
•  What presumptions does Turing make with respect to the importance of our 
learning, visual, linguistic, and motor capabilities? Do his presumptions reflect his 
mathematical background?  
•  Turing provides various arguments against arguments against the possibility of 
machine intelligence. Which is the strongest? Which is the weakest?  
Part IV—Go back over your paper  
Check your paper carefully for style infringements as defined by the Style Guide, 
especially quote misuse. Do this as if such an infringement would expose you to public 
ridicule or an F in the subject.  
Part V—Go back over your paper again  
This time make absolutely sure you have not committed the quotation crime identified in 
the style guide.
