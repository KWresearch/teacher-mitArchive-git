6.803/6.833 The Human Intelligence Enterprise 
Prof. Patrick H. Winston 
Assignment: Textbook Chapter Opening 

 
Paper  
Yip, Kenneth, and Gerald Jay Sussman. “Sparse Representations for Fast, One-Shot 
Learning.” Technical Report 1633, MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, May 1998. 
Also known as “A computational Model for the Acquisition and Use of Phonological 
Knowledge.”  
Assignment  
You have decided you are so thrilled by 6.xxx, you will write a textbook covering the 
material. You arrange an appointment with Professor Winston, during which you go into 
such matters as dealing with publishers, handling reviewers, structuring royalty rates, and 
handling international sales. Winston mutters something about maybe talking about the 
same sort of stuff in class at some point.  

Then, you turn to the writing of the book itself and Winston explains that it is extremely 
important to do a good job on the chapter openings. Unfortunately, your time is up just 
when he is about to explain the standard components in his chapter-opening template.  

On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following.  

•  Reverse engineer the sample chapter openings and exhibit the slots that seem to 
constitute Winston's chapter-opening frame, where "slot" and "frame" are used in 
the 6.034 sense, whatever that means. Consult with a colleague who has taken the 
right version of 6.034 if you are clueless. Add any other slots that seem especially 
important to you.  
•  Write an introduction to a chapter on Yip and Sussman's work, as reported in their 
paper, demonstrating use of whatever frame slots seem appropriate for the 
material.  

Then, be prepared to discuss issues such as the following in class:  

•  How is the Yip/Sussman approach to AI similar to and different from that of 
Brooks?  
•  Which parts of the Yip/Sussman system are most and least believable?  
•  Yip/Sussman argue that sparse spaces make learning possible; are their any other 
virtues to sparse spaces?
