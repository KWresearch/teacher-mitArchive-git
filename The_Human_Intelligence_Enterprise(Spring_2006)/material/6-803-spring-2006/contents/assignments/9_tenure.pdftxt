Dear Professor You:  

We are considering the application of Professor Gary Borchardt for a tenured 
appointment here at MIT. To help us in this process, we would like to have your critical 
evaluation of Professor Borchardt's qualifications. In particular, we would appreciate any 
comments you can provide concerning:  

•  His major contributions, their significance, and how they have influenced others;  
•  His standing in his field (an indication of the worldwide leaders in the field, 
together with your assessment of his relative position in that group, would be 
especially helpful);  
•  His abilities as a teacher;  
•  The quality and stature of his former graduate students;  
•  His qualities as an intellectual leader;  
•  His potential for further professional growth and leadership.  

The more specific you can be in your comments, the more helpful your evaluation will 
be. For your reference, we are enclosing Professor Borchardt's CV and some of his recent 
papers.

An essential component of the evaluation process at M.I.T. is the solicitation of written 
assessments from persons familiar with the individual's character, research and teaching 
capabilities, and academic qualifications. In order to assure the most candid and useful 
evaluations, we have traditionally accorded such assessments the highest degree of 
confidentiality.  

In order to meet our deadlines, we will need your reply by Wednesday, March 8. I very 
much appreciate your help and look forward to hearing from you.  

 
Sincerely yours,  
 
Patrick Henry Winston  
Head, HIE Department  

 

You are to respond to this letter as best you can, having lost the CV and all the papers 
except for Causal Reconstruction.  

Following your usual practice, you totally ignore requests for information you cannot 
supply, so you will not say anything, for example, about teaching or former graduate 
students.  

Based on your reading of his paper, however, you do have an opinion on the merits of the 
appointment. You know that your opinion will not count much unless you demonstrate a 
genuine familiarity with the candidate's work via a clear statement of the candidate's 
vision, buttressed by a detailed assessment of some of the candidates work, including 
contributions.
