Winston's Reading time: 35 minutes  
Supplement  
The following is the MEng thesis on which the paper, with the same title, was based. The 
thesis includes a description of the algorithms uses in map adjustment, growing, 
clustering, and cross-domain cluster association.

MEng Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2003.  
Assignment  
On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following.  

Imagine that you are a graduate student working in Artificial Intelligence at MIT. Your 
research supervisor, , Patrick Winston, says, roughly, “I would like you to go to this 
conference on symbol grounding to see what this stuff is all about. Put together a little 
trip report for me when you get back.” Because the conference is to be held in Sveti 
Stefan, a beautiful medieval town, converted into a resort, on the Adriatic Sea, you 
instantly agree.  

Unfortunately, the talks are boring beyond description, except for Larson's, which closely 
followed the content of the material in his paper.  

•  Produce the requested trip report. Start with something like "The conference 
involved little of interest, except for the paper presented by Larson..." Use what 
you have learned about presentation in the way you structure your report.  

Note: I happened to be the thesis supervisor for the work reported, but you are to ignore 
that connection.

Update: On finishing his MEng thesis, Larson went to work in Wall Street, at Morgan 
Stanley, but two years later, in 2005, he went back to graduate school at UCSD, where he 
is in a neuroscience graduate program.
