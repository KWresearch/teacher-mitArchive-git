Assignment 
On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following.  

Money is tight, and you failed to get the summer UROP job you wanted. Luckily, you did 
land a job as an intern working in Barbara Stowe's office. On your first day at work, she 
sends you the following message by email, just before leaving for the airport:  

President Hockfield had dinner with Pat and Lore McGovern last night. As you know, the 
McGoverns have put a huge pile of money into MIT.  

At dinner, the McGoverns said they want to learn more about what Sur does, whose name 
came up in a conversation with Winston at a soirée, and whether Sur's work could be an 
important bridge between the brain and computer sciences. Hockfield wants us to 
produce a draft letter to the McGovern's describing Sur's work, including a paragraph or 
two on why they should spend even more of their fortune at MIT. Lore mumbled 
something about supporting some West Coast place closer to home.  

Unsure about how to proceed, you send a note to Winston, your 6xxx instructor:  

Who are Pat and Lore McGovern? Where can I find Sur? How soon do you think 
Hockfield will need it? How long should it be?  

And he replies:
