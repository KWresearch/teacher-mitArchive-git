Assignment: Proposals 
 

Paper  
Yuret, Deniz. “Lexical Attraction Models of Language.” MIT Artificial Intelligence 
Laboratory, Cambridge, MA, 1998. 
Assignment  
On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following.  

You are Deniz Yuret. Some years ago, you finished your PhD at MIT and wrote a short 
paper based on that work. Since then, you started up a company, AnswerFriend, during 
the internet craze and after that, returned to Turkey where you have become an assistant 
professor at the highly regarded Koç University in Istanbul (nee Constantinople, nee 
Byzantium). You learn that, come tenure time, obtaining a research grant to support a 
sabbatical in the United States could be a balance-tipping element in your tenure case. 
Also, you have been itching to take the next step beyond your thesis, now on the shelf for 
many years, taking full advantage of the ideas emerging from 6xxx, which you frequently 
access through MIT's OpenCourseWare program.  

Meanwhile, Winston, during a period of temporary insanity, has taken a leave from MIT 
to spend two years at the National Science Foundation, where he has started a program 
titled “Computational Psychology.”  

You can't believe it is the same Winston who supervised your thesis, so you suppose that 
this one has never heard of you or your work.  

•  You decide to write a so-called letter proposal to Winston. Construct a list 
defining what you think you should accomplish in your letter so as to persuade 
Winston to ask for a formal proposal.  
•  Write a letter based on your list.
