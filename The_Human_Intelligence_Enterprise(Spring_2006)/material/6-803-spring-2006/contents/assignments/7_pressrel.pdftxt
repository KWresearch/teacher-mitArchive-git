Prof. Patrick H. Winston 
Assignment: Press Release 

Paper  
Ullman, Shimon, Michel Vidal-Naquet, and Erez Sali.  “Visual features of intermediate 
complexity and their use in classification.” Nature Neuroscience 5, no 7 (July 2002): 
682-687. 

WRT: 1.0 hours  
Assignment  
You are to write an MIT press release for the Ullman et al. work as if it had been 
completed at MIT in CSAIL.  

Your press release should have the elements suggested in the attached sample, including 
the usual journalistic requirement for who, what, where, when, and how, all of which are 
illustrated in the first paragraph.  

Include in your press release, and label for our easy identification, the following:  

•  Your choices for the vision, steps, and contributions.  
•  Your sense of the potential impact of the work.  

Note: This assignment seems to invite humor, and if you feel like writing something 
funny, do so. But also be sure to take the paper seriously, and interdigitate a serious 
assessment with your jokes.  

Also, prepare for classroom discussion by reflecting on similarities and differences in 
Ullman's two papers with respect to goals and methods.

For Immediate Release 

STUDENTS DEMONSTRATE COLD FUSION TO SATISFY SUBJECT 
REQUIREMENT  

CAMBRDIGE, MA, April 1, 2005. Susan Hockfield, president of MIT, announced that a 
group of computer-science students has demonstrated a way to produce abundant energy 
through cold fusion at essentially zero cost. Dr. Hockfield indicated that the student 
group serendipitously stumbled across the essential ideas during the past month while 
working on a term project.  

Blah, blah, blah, ... vision, contribution, what was actually done, surprises, potential 
impact, ... blah, blah, blah  

A spokesperson for the student group explained that some of the members were upset that 
they would not benefit financially from the discovery, because of MIT's recently 
announced intellectual-property policy, which establishes MIT ownership of all 
patentable ideas and copyrightable material developed by students, their ancestors, and 
descendants.  

When asked if the new MIT policy would withstand legal challenges, Provost Rafael Reif 
explains that innovation is not limited to science and technology. "Law is the next 
frontier for creative minds," he said, "and this new policy really is the only way we can 
close the gap in the operating budget."  

According to reliable sources, other members of the group worried about whether their 
project would be viewed as A-level work by their instructor Professor Patrick H. 
Winston. As the project was presented to him, he was heard to say, "I don't care how 
important it is, it's not AI."  

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology educates men and women of high potential 
through degree programs in engineering, science, business, architecture, and the 
humanities. The Institute is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
