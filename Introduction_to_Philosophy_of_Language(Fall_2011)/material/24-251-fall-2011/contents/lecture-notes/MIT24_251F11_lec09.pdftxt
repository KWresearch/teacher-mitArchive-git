Truth-Conditional Theories 

10/12/11 

Looking at foundational theories of meaning––theories of how meaning emerges out of lower level phenomena.  
For Grice, the phenomena are individual intentions.  For Lewis, they're social conventions. 

“[N]o one is able to persuade me that the correctness of names is determined by anything besides convention… 
No name belongs to a particular thing by nature, but only because of the rules and usages of those who establish 
the usage and call it by that name” (Plato, Cratylus, 384c-d), 

Can this be right?  Language does seem like a system of conventions.  But, one might think conventions are things 
we sit down and agree to, and that never happened with language. Bertrand Russell: “[w]e can hardly suppose a 
parliament of hitherto speechless elders meeting together and agreeing to call a cow a cow and a wolf a wolf” 
(1921, p. 190) 

Take the convention that one drives on the right (not on the left), or that the original caller will re-call if a phone 
conversation is interrupted, etc.  What do these have in common?  They solve coordination problems. 

A coordination problem is a situation where our interests do not conflict, but what it makes sense for you to do 
depends on what I do and vice versa.  We might sit down and discuss it.  But we might equally hit on a solution by 
trial and error, or dumb luck.  

Conventions (roughly): regularities in behavior to which people conform because they think others do too, and 
because it's better if are all on the same page. 

Conventions (more precise analysis): a regularity R in behavior is a convention in population P iff 

(i)  everyone conforms to R 
(ii) everyone believes others conform to R 
(iii) this belief about others gives everyone a good reason to conform to R him- or herself 
(iv) everyone prefers this to salient alternatives (compare deadlocked conflict, e.g. nuclear deterrence) 
(v) R is not the only possible regularity meeting these conditions 
(vi) all this is common knowledge in the population. 

Thesis. A language is a formal object, a mapping from sentences σ to propositions (intensions) p. 
Antithesis. Language is a rational, rule-governed activity, to do with how people use words. 

Synthesis:  A language £ is indeed a formal mapping.  But when we ask, what mustP be like for £ to be the 
language they speak, the answer is they must use words in a certain sort of rule-governed way. What way? 

A sentence of £ is true iff the proposition £ maps it to is true, that is, it contains the actual world. 

£ is used by a population of speakers Just in case a convention of truthfulness and trust prevails, sustained by a 
common interest in communication. 
o 
o 

truthfulness, in that the speakers try to utter only true sentences of £; 
trust,  in that they believe others to be truthful in £, and so come to believe what they say. 

Note, none of this tells us what exactly happens in P to associate the right propositions with the right sentences. 
Take names.  Maybe Kripke is right that it's matter of causal connections.  Maybe Frege is right and it's a matter of 
how we conceive the referent.  This suggests there could be two communities, both speaking £,  such that Kripke 
 
is right about one and Frege is right about the other.   Is that a problem for Lewis's definition? 

Objections. 

(1) The picture is too simple.  What about ambiguity; indexicals; imperatives, questions, etc?  (661ff) 

(2) What  about the meanings of words?  What about compositionality? This is crucial if languages are going to be 
learnable by finite beings like ourselves.  (664ff).....see Davidson. 

(3) Can't I speak a language all by myself?  (669) 

(4) Can't a community of inveterate liars nevertheless speak a language? (669ff)
