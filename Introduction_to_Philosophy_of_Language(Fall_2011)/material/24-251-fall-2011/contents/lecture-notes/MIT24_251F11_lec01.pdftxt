Language is special 
⇒  Word magic, tiny causes for huge effects. 
⇒  Action at a distance, sentences true here because of events there. 
⇒  Human vs non-human animals 
⇒  Infinite scope, compositionality. 

Language is not special 
⇒  Just one more form of intelligent collaboration––games, family, hunting 
⇒  Natural meaning exists, too; spots means measles, etc. 
⇒  Atoms have an infinite range of possible combinations. 

Syntax, Semantics, Pragmatics 

Syntax: how words relate to other words.  'John is easy to please' vs 'John is eager to please.'
 
Semantics: how words relate to their meanings.
 
Pragmatics: how words relate to their uses.  “X has neat handwriting and is always punctual.”
 

Syntax:  Use and mention 

Fish have gills, ‘Fish’ has four letters, ‘Fish’ is a word of English, ‘'Fish’' names a word of English 

Syntax: The subject/predicate analysis 

Aristotle was a philosopher 
No one lives forever 
Whales are mammals 
The mullet is a fish 

Kenyans are good long distance runners 
More than 90% of animals are insects 
The bridge collapsed because a bolt snapped 
June said to stop 

Semantics: The ‘Fido’-Fido theory theory of meaning. A word means what it stands for. 

⇒  Phrases, sentences, texts have meaning, not just words. 
⇒  Not every word is a term; ‘or,’ ‘of,’ ‘however,’ ‘very,’… 
⇒  Not obviously right even for terms 
⇒  7 = the square root of 49; Superman = Clark Kent (identity) 
⇒  Santa Claus is supposed to have a beard (non-referring terms) 
⇒  Santa Claus doesn’t exist (negative existentials) 
⇒  Lois loves Superman, not Clark Kent (attitudes) 

Pragmatics:  Implicature 

⇒  The captain was sober today. 
⇒  I am too 5’ tall. 

Pragmatics: Indirect speech acts 

⇒  Can you file this? 
⇒  I want you to file this. 
⇒  You should file this.
