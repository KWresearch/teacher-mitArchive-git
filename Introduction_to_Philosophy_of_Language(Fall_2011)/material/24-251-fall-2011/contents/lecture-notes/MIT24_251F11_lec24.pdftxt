Semantic Pretense & Attitude Ascriptions

12/5/11

Frege: “identity challenges reflection.” Russell: “you are halfͲtempted to think that there are two
people…., and they happen to be the same. That is obviously absurd, but that is the sort of way one is
always tempted to deal with identity.”The temptation runs deep. “They are identical.” “Hesperus is
the Evening Star, not the Morning Star.” “Of the ten things on this list, which are distinct?” Similar
temptation with existence.

If we think a certain way, but can’t take it ultimately seriously, that sounds like a job for pretense. If
we’re nevertheless making genuine assertions about the world, that sounds like a job for propͲoriented
pretense, or what Crimmins calls semantic pretense.

Compare (3): Ann is as clever as Holmes and more modest than Watson. The fictional truthͲcondition
is the how Ann has to be for this to be fictional. Semantic pretense occurs when the real truthͲ
condition = the fictional truthͲcondition.

Try it on (11) Hammurabi thought Hesperus was brighter than Phosphorus. How does Hammurabi
have to be for this to be fictional?....Well, what is the fiction? “There are two things referred to as ‘H’
and ‘P’; when a thought involves the HͲmode (the PͲmode), it’s directed at the first thing (the second
thing). “ (5) is fictional if Hammurabi thinks [mH] is brighter than [mP], that is, he thinks Venus is
brighter than Venus, thinking of it the first time via mH and the second time via mP.

This synthesizes Frege and Russell! In the makeͲbelieve we’re Russellians; no need to mention modes
of presentation because there’s a different object for each. The serious content by contrast is partly
Fregean; we pretend Hammurabi is thinking about two very fineͲgrained objects to really express that
he is thinking via the modes of presentation to which they correspond.

(a) Empty names. (13) Elijah believes Santa is overworked. Just as we talk as if each mode of
presentation has its own object, we talk as if each has an object.

(b) Simple sentences. (17) Hammurabi’s way was lit more often by H than by P. This is fictional if his
way was lit more often by Venus when he conceived it via mH than via mP.

(c) Existence. (33) Santa does not exist. Existence is really an indiscriminate property; it attaches to
everything. But we pretend that existence is a discriminating property, applying to some things but not
others. We pretend a thing exists just on the condition that the corresponding mode of presentation
refers. So we pretend that Santa does not exist, since mS does not refer. The fictional (hence real)
truthͲcondition is that mS is empty.

(d) Identity. (31) When two things are identical, the one has the same properties as the other.
Identity is really a celibate property, but we pretend it’s promiscuous, in the sense of obtaining
between distinct things. The rule is to pretend that A = B iff really mA coͲrefers with mB. The fictional
(hence real) truthͲcondition of ‘H = P’ is that mH and mP coͲrefer, but it “feels” like we’re saying that the
corresponding fineͲgrained objects, though two in number, stand in the relation of identity.
