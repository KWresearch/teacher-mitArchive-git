Attitudes, the Pragmatic Theory

11/23/11

Belief attributions state relations between believers and the propositions they believe.
A dilemma about those propositions.

Individual truthÍ²value judgments suggest they should be extremely fineÍ²grainedâ€“â€“since
for almost any two sentences S and S', one can rationally believe that S without
believing that S'. E.g. one can believe the Pope will arrive in a fortnight without believing
he will arrive in a couple of weeks.

General theory of belief content suggests belief should be a relation to something
coarseÍ²grainedâ€“â€“for beliefs get their content from the kind of external condition they
covary with, and necessarily equivalent conditions (ones holding in the same possible
worlds) covary with the same things.

Four assumptions create this conflict: (0) belief is a relation thinkers bear to
propositions;
(1) necessarily equivalent objects of belief are identical (propositions are
sets of worlds), (2) sentences P and Q are necessarily equivalent, (3) it is possible to
believe that P while doubting whether Q.

The most common response (Frege) is to reject (1) and treat belief contents as finerÍ²
grained than sets of possible worlds. The second most common response is to reject (3)
and insist we believe P iff we believe Q (Salmon, Soames). The third most common is to
reject (0) and conceive belief as a threeÍ²place relation between believers, contents, and
beliefÍ²states (Crimmins and Perry). Stalnaker has a new response: accept (0), (1), and
(3), but reject (2). Insist that P and Q are not in context necessarily equivalent. Hesperus
is Mars for instance is not in context (after X believes that) necessarily equivalent to
Hesperus is Mercury.

Suppose Daniels says O'Leary thinks Hesperus = Mars, and I say O'Leary thinks Hesperus
= Mercury. A two part strategy.

(A) Ask yourself in which worlds, intuitively speaking, is O'Leary correct. as Daniels sees
it? In which worlds is O'Leary correct, as I see it? The first set P1 is the proposition
expressed by Hesperus = Mars in O'Leary believes that Hesperus = Mars, the second P2
is the one expressed by Hesperus = Mercury in O'Leary believes that Hesperus =
Mercury. (B) Look for a semantic mechanism that maps Hesperus = Mars sentence to P1
and Hesperus = Mercury to P2.

Now clearly, (A) P1 is the set of worlds where HesperusÍ²appearances are due to Mars.
P2 is the set of worlds where they're due to Mercury. But (B) is harder. P1 and P2 sound
a lot like the diagonal propositions expressed by Hesperus = Mars/Mercury.

But that can't be quite right, because the diagonal proposition is defined only on

worlds in the context set; and the context set I share with Daniels contains no P1Í²worlds
or P2Í²worlds. Daniels and I agree that HesperusÍ²appearances are due to Venus. "There
are no possible worlds compatible with the background presuppositions of our
conversation in which the solar system is arranged so that Mars appears where [we
agree] Venus in fact appears" (M, 466). Something has to give.

"We ask something like the following question: If Daniels were to utter the sounds he is
uttering in a world compatible with O'Leary's beliefs, what would the content of those
sounds be?....If we extend the propositional content in this way, defining it for the
situations that might, for all Daniels and I are presupposing, be compatible with
O'Leary's beliefs, then the diagonal of that propositional concept will be the proposition
that seems, intuitively, to be the one O'Leary is said to believe" (M, 466).

So, our utterance of "O'Leary believes that S" is true iff O'Leary stands in the belief
relation to the proposition that S expresses, not in the world as it is, but in the world as
O'Leary thinks it is. This is basically to say that S after "O'Leary believes that" expresses
what O'Leary would have asserted had she uttered S in a world in her context set.

"What if O'Leary speaks a language other than English?" "The propositional concept we
construct is the one not for the sentence as O'Leary would use or understand it, but for
the sentence as the speaker and addressee would understand it if they were in the
possible worlds relative to which the propositional concept is being defined." Try this
out on examples.
