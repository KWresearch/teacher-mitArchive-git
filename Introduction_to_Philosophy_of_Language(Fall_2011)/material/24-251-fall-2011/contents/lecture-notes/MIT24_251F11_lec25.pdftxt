Pragmatic Pretense & Frege Problems

12/7/11

oon starts where Crimmins does, with the conflict between Fregean truthͲconditions and Russelliam
Kr
ph
enomenology.

egean thesis: The contribution made by the name is not exhausted by its referent; the name
Fr
ntributes what the referent is supposed to be like. “’Hamlet does not exist’ is (used to say something)
co
ue without ‘Hamlet’ denoting anyone” (523). It says that no one is the way Hamlet is supposed to be.
tr

ssellian antithesis: The truth of these statements turns on the properties of the referent. “It is
Ru
be
cause of Hamlet’s not existing that ‘Hamlet does not exist’ is true…it is because of the distinct beliefs
ammurabi had about these two celestial bodies––identical bodies, as it turns out––that ‘Hammurabi
H
be
lieves that only Hesperus, not Phosphorus as well, was visible in the evening” (523).

H
e sees two problems with the semantic pretense account. One is about modality. Crimmins says
‘H
esperus exists’ expresses its fictional truthͲconditions, viz. that mH presents something. But then it
sh
ould be true in a possible world w iff mH presents something in w. However this fails in both
di
rections; Hesperus exists in worlds where mH doesn’t exist, say because life never evolved. And mH
m
ight well present something (e.g. Mars) even in worlds where Hesperus doesn’t exist. Again, Hamlet
guably couldn’t have existed; but our HamletͲidea could have referred. Similarly Hesperus is
ar
ne
cessarily identical Phosphorus but it holds only contingently that mH presents the same thing as mP.

Th
e second problem is that ‘exists’ and ‘is identical to’ mean one thing in the game, a completely
di
fferent thing outside it. Postulating an ambiguity is the lazy person’s approach to philosophy. Better if
w
e could explain Frege cases without departing from the literal meaning of ‘exists’ (it’s true of
ev
erything) or ‘identical to’ (the relation a thing bears to itself).

H
e structures his own theory around an analogy between ‘Hamlet doesn’t exist’ and quasiͲparadoxical
di
sclaimers like ‘That woman isn’t a woman.’ His story about the latter: “The interpretive tension
ge
nerated by the utterance tells his audience that he is only pretending that his means of securing
re
ference with ‘that woman’ singles out a woman….What the speaker then asserts is that, construed
fr
om outside the pretense, this [phrase] singles out an individual who is not a woman, thereby asserting
of
the individual referred to that this individual is not a woman” (530).

Si
milarly ‘Hamlet doesn’t really exist’ creates an “interpretive tension” which the speaker uses to assert
th
at (12) Outside of the pretense that the underlying reference determiner secures reference to an
in
dividual, it fails to secure reference to any individual (532). ‘Those two famous celestial bodies are
id
entical’ “involves a contradiction inside the pretense…” This leads the audience to “look beyond [the]
ev
ident, graphic falsity to other claims which are thereby made salient.” Part of what the speaker
as
serts is (4) Outside the scope of the pretense that ‘H’ and ‘P’ secure reference to two celestial bodies,
th
ey secure reference to a single object only (531).

H
ow does this help with the modal problem? How does it help with the ambiguity problem? See p.

H
ow convincing is Kroon’s pragmatic pretense account? There are jillions of ways to resolve
“i
nterpretive tension.” Why should the resolution take the form Kroon wants? The tension created by



‘That woman is not a woman’ could also be relieved by taking the predicate to be uttered in a spirit of
make believe (is not out of the pages of Cosmopolitan). Likewise one could resolve the tension brought
on by an utterance of ‘Hamlet does not exist’ by lightening up on the predicate: we have disowned him,
or he has disappeared from the official records.

Kroon seems to underestimate the gap between showing that his proposed mechanism could churn out
the desired reading and showing that it would churn out the desired reading. Not unlike what we saw
with Grice, the mechanism is too close to a black box stipulated to produce the correct results.
