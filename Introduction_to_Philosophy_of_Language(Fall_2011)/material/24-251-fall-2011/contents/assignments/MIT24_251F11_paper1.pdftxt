Write an 8 page paper on one of the following topics.  
 
(1) Hempel's "contemporary empiricist" recognizes two ways for a sentence to be cognitively 
significant. What are they?  Hempel considers two versions of the testability criterion:  complete 
verifiability and complete falsifiability. Explain his objections to each.  Does Hempel think one can do 
better by focusing on a sentence's constituent terms?  Why or why not?  How optimistic is Hempel 
about the prospects for an empiricist criterion of meaningfulness?   
 
(2)  What are Quine's two dogmas of empiricism?  Explain why he thinks that denying the second 
dogma forces one to reject the first dogma as well.  What positive theory does Quine ofer in place of 
reductionism? What methodological consequences (e.g., consequences for belief acceptance and 
revision) does Quine draw from his denial of the second dogma? 
 
(3) Explain Grice's distinction between natural and non-natural meaning.  He suggests an analysis of 
what is involved in my meaning that p by my utterance x: 
 

(*)  I intend x to bring my audience to believe that p, not for any old reason, but because they 
recognize that I intend x to have this result.  

 
Explain, through a discussion of one of Grice's examples, why he thinks that an intention to produce a 
belief by means of the recognition of this intention is so important. One might question whether (*) is 
really necessary for non-natural meaning.  Why should the intended effect have to be a belief, for 
instance?  Do you agree with Grice that (*) is sufficient?  Try to think of a case where (*) is satisfied, 
but I don't see myself as meaning that p.  Or,  explain why such a case cannot be found.
