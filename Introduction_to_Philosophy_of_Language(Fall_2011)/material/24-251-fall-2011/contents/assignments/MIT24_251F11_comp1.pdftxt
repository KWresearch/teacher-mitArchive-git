24.251 Comprehension Exercise 
Fall 2011 

 
Russell in 'On Denoting' says, ‚ÄúA logical theory may be tested by its 
capacity for dealing with puzzles‚Äù (p233 in Martinich).  He lists ‚Äúthree 
puzzles which a theory as to denoting ought to be able to solve.‚Äù 
 
 
1. What are the puzzles and how does Russell propose to solve them?  This 
should take about 2 pages. 
 
2. Pick one of the puzzles and say, very briefly, whether you think that 
Russell‚Äôs solution is satisfactory. If you have an objection, present it 
concisely. If you have more than one, just give what you take to be the most 
decisive. Do not devote more than one page to this task.
