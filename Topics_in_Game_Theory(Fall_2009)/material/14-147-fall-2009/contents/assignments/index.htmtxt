***** Referee Reports *****
Students are required to write three referee reports due in Ses #3, Ses #5, and
Ses #7. A referee report evaluates the paper on its readiness for publication
by commenting on the results, the structure, and the exposition of the paper.
For details, please refer to William Thomson's article:
Guidelines on writing referee reports ([This resource may not render correctly
in a screen reader.]PDF)
The suggested articles for the three referee reports are listed below.

***** Research Paper *****
A short 2-3 page progress report on the research paper is due one week after
Ses #7, and the final paper is due 6 weeks later at the end of the January
Independent Activities Period (IAP). The goal of the research paper is to lay
the foundation for dissertation work. The paper may be empirical or theoretical
in nature. I will meet with students in the middle of January to check the
progress of the paper.
