***** Course Meeting Times *****
Lectures: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session
***** Description *****
This course is an advanced topics course on market and mechanism design. We
will study existing or new market institutions, understand their properties,
and think about whether they can be re-engineered or improved. Topics discussed
include mechanism design, auction theory, one-sided matching in house
allocation, two-sided matching, stochastic matching mechanisms, student
assignment, and school choice.
***** Prerequisites *****
This course assumes knowledge of the first year economics Ph.D. sequence,
especially of microeconomic theory: 14.121-14.124 Microeconomic Theory I-IV,
14.451 Dynamic Optimization Methods with Applications, 14.452 Economic Growth,
14.453 Economic Fluctuations, and 14.454 Economic Crises. 14.126 Game Theory
and courses from the industrial organization sequence (14.271 Industrial
Organization I and 14.272 Industrial Organization II) are helpful but not
essential background.

***** Course Organization *****
**** Course Goals and Expectations ****
The aim of this course is to get students to the research frontier. We will
spend most of the course reading and discussing research papers. The first few
classes I will have lectures on some important background material. Once the
basics are covered, we will develop some of the recent themes of market design
with an emphasis on areas where there has been recent activity, and where I
think there is scope for additional work. Some of this will be open-ended and
the idea is to spur discussion. It will be critical that students read the
papers in this class to facilitate the discussion and depending on enrollment
and participation, we may ask students to present papers.
**** Course Requirements ****
The requirements for this course are to write three referee reports and a
research paper. The referee reports are due on Ses #3, Ses #5, and Ses #7. The
papers students may write referee reports on are labeled in the readings. If
there is a paper that you think is relevant which is not on the list, please
come see me.
A short progress report on the research paper is due one week after Ses #7, and
the final paper is due at the end of the January Independent Activities Period
(IAP), with no exceptions. The hope is that good papers form a foundation for
dissertation work. I will meet with students in the middle of January to check
the progress of the paper.
