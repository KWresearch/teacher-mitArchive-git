Let  V  and  W  be  two  F-vector  spaces.  Then  there  is  a  natural  structure 
of  vector  space  on  V  × W  = {(v , w)  : v ≤ V , w ≤ W },  as  follows 
(v1 , w1 ) + (v2 , w2 )  := (v1  + v2 , w1  + w2 ) 
k(v1 , w1 ) := (kv1 , kw1 ), 
for  any  v1 , v2  ≤ V ,  w1 , w2  ≤ W ,  k  ≤ F.  It  is  easy  to  check  that  the  axioms 
in  the  deﬁnition  of  a  vector  space  (deﬁnition  1.2.4.)  hold. 
V  can  be  viewed  as  the  subspace {(v , 0)  : v  ≤ V } of V  × W  and W  as  the 
subspace  {(0, w)  : w ≤ W }. 
Assume  V  is  n-dimensional,  with  a  basis  BV  =  {v1 , . . . , vn}  and  W  is 
m-dimensional,  with  a  basis  BW  =  {w1 , . . . , wm }.  Then  a  basis  for  V  × W 
is  given  by  BV ×W  =  {(vi , 0)  :  1  �  i  �  n} � {(0, wj )  :  1  �  j  �  m},  which 
implies  that  the  dimension  of  V  × W  is  m + n.  Let  us  check  that  B V ×W  is 
indeed  a  basis. 
linear independence:  Consider the linear relation �n  ai (vi , 0)+�m
j=1 bj (0, wj ) = 
i=1 
n 
(0, 0).  This implies (�n  aivi , �m
=1 aivi  = 
j=1 bj wj ) = (0, 0) and therefore �i
i=1 
0  and  �m 
=  0.  Since  {v1 , . . . , vn }  in  V ,  respectively  {w1 , . . . , wm }
j=1 bj wj 
in  W  are  linearly  independent,  it  follows  that  a i  =  0,  for  all  1  �  i  �  n, 
respectively  bj  = 0,  for  all  1 � j  � m.  This  proves  the  linear  independence. 
spanning  set:  Let  (v , w)  be  an  element  in  V  × W .  Then  v  ≤  V  can  be 
�n
written  as  a  linear  combination  v  = 
i=1 vi  because  {v1 , . . . , vn }  span  V . 
j=1 wj .  Then  (v , w) = �n  ai (vi , 0) + 
= �m
Similarly w  can  be written  as w 
i=1 
�m  bj (0, wj ).  This  implies  that  BV ×W  is  a  spanning  set  for  V  × W .
j=1 
Also  remark  that  if  V  is  a  subset  of  some  Fk  and  W  is  a  subspace  of  an 
Fp ,  then  V  × W  is  a  subspace  of  Fk+p . 

A homework  exercise  asked  to  show that  if V  and W  are  subspaces of  the 
same  vector  space  U ,  then  V  + W  =  {v + w  :  v  ≤ V , w  ≤  W }  and  V  � W 
are  also  subspaces  of  the  same  vector  space  U .  Note  that  V  � W  is  not 
a  subspace  in  general.  For  example,  if  V  and  W  are  two  lines  containing 
the  origin  of  R3  (so  they  are  subspaces),  V  � W  is  the  union  of  the  two 
lines,  so  it  is  not  a  subspace  (there  are  vectors  v  ≤ V  and w ≤ W  such  that 
v + w  /≤  V  � W ).  In  this  example  V  + W  is  the  plane  containing  the  two 
lines,  and  V  � W  is  just  a  point,  the  origin. 
Let  us  show  that  if  V  and  W  are  ﬁnite  dimensional  (of  dimensions  n, 
respectively  m)  than 
dim(V ) + dim(W ) = dim(V  � W ) + dim(V  + W ). 
In  the  example  above,  this  is  1 + 1 = 2 + 0. 
Since  V  � W  is  a  subspace  of  V  (or W ),  it  is  ﬁnite  dimensional.  Assume 
its  dimension  is  p  � min{n, m}  and  let  {v1 , . . . , vp}  be  a  basis  for  V  � W . 
The  set  {v1 , . . . , vp}  is  linearly  independent  as  a  subset  of  V ,  so  it  can  be 
extended  to  a  basis  of  V ,  {v1 , . . . , vp , vp+1 , . . . vn}.  Similarly  there  is  a  basis

of W ,  {v1 , . . . , vp , wp+1 , . . . , wm }.  The  claim would  follow  if we  showed  that 
the  set  {v1 , . . . , vp , vp+1 , . . . , vn , wp+1 , . . . , wm }  were  a  basis  for  V  + W . 
linearly  independent:  consider  the  linear  relation  a 1v1  +  · · ·  +  apvp  + 
. . . anvn  + bp+1wp+1  + . . . bmwm  =  0.  This  implies  that  a1v1  + . . . anvn  = 
−(bp+1wp+1  +  . . . bmwm ).  Call  this  element  x.  The  left  hand  side  implies 
that  x  ≤  V  and  the  right  hand  side  that  x  ≤  W .  So  x  ≤  V  � W  and 
therefore  x  can  be  expressed  as  a  linear  combination  of  the  basis  vectors  of 
V  � W :  x = c1 v1 + · · · + cpvp .  Then a1v1 + · · · + apvp + ap+1vp+1 + . . . anvn  = 
c1v1 + · · ·+ cpvp , and so (a1 − c1 )v1 + · · ·+ (ap − cp)vp + ap+1 cp+1 + . . . an cn  = 0. 
Since {v1 , . . . , vn}  is a  basis  for V ,  and  in particular  linearly  independent,  it 
follows  that  a1  = c1 , . . . , ap  = cp  and  ap+1  = · · · = an  = 0. 
Going  back  to  the  relation  we  started  with  and  using  a p+1  =  · · · = an  = 
0,  it  implies  that  a1 v1  +  · · ·  +  apvp  +  bp+1wp+1  +  . . . bmwm  =  0.  Since 
{v1 , . . . , vp , wp+1 , . . . , wm }  is  a  basis  of W ,  it  follows  that  a1  = · · · = ap  = 0 
and bp+1  = · · · = bm  = 0.  In conclusion all scalars in the linear relation must 
be  zero,  and  therefore  {v1 , . . . , vp , vp+1 , . . . , vn , wp+1 , . . . , wm }  is  linearly  in­
dependent.
