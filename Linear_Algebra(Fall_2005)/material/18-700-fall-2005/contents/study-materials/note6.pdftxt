Linear  operators  of  R2 .  November  7,  2005 

The purpose of this note is to illustrate the notion of  linear  operators,  by looking 
at some examples of  linear transformations of  the plane, T  : R2  � R2 . We will con­
sider the standard basis of R2  and all matrices associated to a linear transformation 
will  be  written  with  respect  to  this  basis. 

into  the  vector 

1.  Rotations:  Let  R�  be  the  linear  transformation  given  by  rotation  counter­
clockwise  by  the  angle  �.  The  matrix  associated  to  R�  is 
 
 
[R� ] =  cos(�)  − sin(�) 
�


. 
cos(�) 
sin(�) 
This  is  clearly  an  invertible  transformation  and  the  inverse  is  the  rotation  by  � 
clockwise,  or  R −� .  The  composition  of  two  rotations  R�1  � R�2  is  again  a  rotation 
R�1 +�2 .  Note  that  the  composition  of  rotations  is  commutative  and  that  the  rota­
tions  form  a  group  (the  unit  element  is  the  identity  operator,  or  the  rotation  by 
angle  0).  This  group  is  called  the  special  orthogonal  group  of  R2 ,  and  it  is  denoted 
by  SO(2). 
2.  Dilations:  For  a, b  >  0,  let  Da,b  denote  the  linear  transformation  which

.  Since  a =  0  and  b  =  0,  Da,b  is  invertible  and  the  inverse  is  the

dilation Da−1 ,b−1 . 
3.  Shear  transformations:  typical  examples  are  the  shear  transformations

moves  the  tip  of  a  vector  v  parallel  with  the  x-axis  (in  general  parallel  to  a  line) 
and  ﬁxes  the  vectors  in  the  x-axis.  They  are  invertible  transformations  and  the 
 
 
inverses are given by the  opposite shear transformation, e.g.  in  this case  1  −a

4.  Pro jections:  having  ﬁxed  a  line  L,  the  map  PL  deﬁned  by  pro jecting  a 
vector  v  on  the  line  L  is  a  linear  transformation.  Denote  the  pro jection  on  the 
x-axis  by  Px  and  similarly,  the  pro jection  onto  the  y -axis  by  Py .  The  pro jections

5.  Reﬂections:  the map SL  deﬁned by taking the symmetric of a vector v  about 
a  ﬁxed  line  L  is  a  linear  transformation.  They  are  invertible  transformations,  in

We  should  remark  that  the  translations,  i.e.  T (v) =  v + v0 ,  for  some  ﬁxed  v0 , 
are  not  linear  transformations.

Proposition.  Any  nonzero  linear  transformation  of  R2  can  be  obtained  as  a 
composition  of  linear  transformations  of  types  1-5. 
Proof.  The  heart  of  the  proof  is  the  following  decomposition  of  2 × 2  invertible 
matrices  (it’s  actually part  of  a more  general result):  any  invertible  2 × 2 matrix A

(x  and  z  cannot  both  be  zero,  since  A  is  invertible).

Verify  by  a  direct  calculation  that  the  decomposition  above  (with  b =  a−1 )  holds. 
The  case  of  general  invertible  A  follows  easily,  by  multiplying  the  diagonal matrix 
with  det(A).  We  hope  to  treat  this  decomposition  in  a  more  conceptual  way  later 
in  the  course. 
In  this  decomposition,  the  ﬁrst  matrix  corresponds  to  a  rotation,  the  diagonal 
matrix  to  a dilation Da,b  or  a  composition of  a dilation with  a  reﬂection  (if  a  and  b 
are not both positive), and  the  third matrix corresponds to a shear transformation. 
Therefore  the  invertible  linear  transformation  with  matrix  A  can  be  realized  as  a 
composition  of  a  rotation,  a  reﬂection,  a  dilation,  and  a  shear  transformation. 
Now, consider a general (maybe noninvertible) linear transformation with matrix 
B  =  0.  Then  B  =  U R,  where  U  is  an  invertible  matrix  and  R  is  the  row-reduced 
→echelon form.  We know  the  transformation corresponding to U  can be decomposed 
as above, so  it remains  to analyze the  transformations corresponding to all reduced 
echelon  forms.  If  R  is  the  identity  (the  case when B  is  invertible),  there  is  nothing

It means  that  the  corresponding transformation is a composition between a pro jec­
tion  and  a  shear  transformation.

so  it  is  the  composition  of  Px  with  the  reﬂection  about  the  line  x = y . 
This  concludes  the  proof.
