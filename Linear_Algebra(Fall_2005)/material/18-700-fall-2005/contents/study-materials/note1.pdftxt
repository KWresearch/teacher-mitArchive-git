Notes  on  Lecture  3  (September  12,  2005) 

1.  In  class,  I mentioned  the  following  exercise: 

Proposition.  Fix  the  positive  integer  m.  If M  is  an  n × n  matrix  with  the 
property  that 

for  al l  m × n  matrices  A, 
A · M  = A, 
then  M  = In  (the  identity  matrix). 
Proof.  A · M  =  A  for  all  A.  The  idea  is  to  choose  some  particular  A.  Let 
A = E1q ,  where  E1q  is  the  m × n  matrix  whose  entries  are  all  zero,  except 
the  (1, q)-entry,  which  is  1.  Check  that,  if  M  = (m ij ),  then  E1,q M  is  the 
matrix  whose  rows  are  all  zero,  except  the  ﬁrst  row,  which  equals  the  q -th 
row  of M.  For  example,  for  3 × 3 matrices,

Since we  require  that E1q M  = E1q ,  it  follows  that mql  = 0  for  all  l  �= q ,  and 
mqq  =  1.  Varying  q ,  1  �  q  �  n,  we  ﬁnd  that  all  oﬀ  diagonal  entries  of  M 
have  to  be  zero  and  all  diagonal  entries  are  1.  This  implies M  = I n .

A(i, j )B (j, k)C (k , l) = 

2.  In  the  proof of  associativity  for matrix multiplication,  the key  step  are 
the  equalities:

B (j, k)C (k , l). 
A(i, j ) 
j=1 
k=1 
For  the  second  equality,  note  that A(i, j )  does  not  depend on  k ,  so  it  can 
p 
be  factored  outside  the  sum 
k=1 . 
⎞
The  ﬁrst  equality  comes  from  changing  the  order  of  summation.  This  is 
correct,  since  we  have  ﬁnite  sums.  For  inﬁnite  sums  (a.k.a.  series),  one  can 
change the order of summation only  in series which converge absolutely.  For 
example,  one  can  sum  the  terms  of  the  series 
1

1 +  +  +  + . . .

in  any  order,  and  the  result  would  still  be  �

But  for  the  alternating  harmonic  series

which  converges  to  ln 2  (but  it  is  not  absolutely  convergent),  changing  the 
order of the summation will aﬀect  the result (in  fact,  if we pick any constant 
1

c,  it  is possible to change  the order in which we sum terms in this series such 
that  the  resulting  sum  is  c).
