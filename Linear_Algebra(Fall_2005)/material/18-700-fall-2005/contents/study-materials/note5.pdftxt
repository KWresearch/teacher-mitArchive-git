Permutations.  November  5,  2005 

The  purpose  of  this  note  is  to  summarize  some  properties  of  the  permutations. 
Recall  that  a permutation  of  n  is  a string � = (�1 , . . . , �n ), where �i  � {1, 2, . . . , n} 
and �i  �
= �j  is i  �
= j .  A better deﬁnition is to say that a permutation �  is a bijective 
function 

�(i) = �i . 
�  : {1, 2, . . . , n} � {1, 2, . . . , n},
Denote  the  set  of all permutations of n by Sn .  A distinguished  element  of Sn  is  the 
identity  permutation,  � = (1, 2, . . . , n). 
If � = (�1 , . . . , �n ) � Sn , we say that (�i , �j ) is an inversion  if �i  > �j  and i < j . 
Denote  by  �(�)  the  number  of  inversions  in  the  permutation  � .  Then  the  sign  of  � 
is  sg(�) = (−1)�(�) ,  and  we  say  that  �  is  an  even  (odd)  permutation  if  sg(�) = 1 
(respectively, −1). 

Example.  In  S6 ,  consider  � = (5, 6, 4, 2, 3, 1).  Then  �(�) = 10,  and  sg(�) = 1. 
We  record  some  properties  of  permutations. 

1.  It  is  possible  to  deﬁne  multiplication  of  two  permutations.  This  is  clear  if  we 
think  of  permutations  as  functions;  then  the  multiplication  is  the  composition  of 
functions.  In  the  other  notation,  if  �  = (�1 , . . . , �n )  and  �  = (�1 , . . . , �n )  are  two 
permutation, deﬁne the product � ·�  to be the permutation � ·�  = (��1 , ��2 , . . . , �� ). n 
For  example,  if  �  =  (4, 2, 3, 1)  and  �  =  (3, 1, 2, 4),  then  �  · �  =  (3, 4, 2, 1),  and 
�  · �  =  (4, 1, 2, 3).  Note  that  multiplication  of  permutations  is  not  commutative, 
but  it  is  associative  (because  the  composition  of  functions  is). 

2.  Every  permutation  has  an  inverse.  If  �  �  Sn  is  a  permutation,  then  there 
exists  a  permutation  �−1  � Sn  such  that  � · �−1  =  �−1  · �  = 1n ,  where  by  1n  we 
denoted  here  the  identity  permutation  in  Sn .  Again,  this  statement  is  clear  if  we 
think  of  permutations  as  bijective  functions.  For  example,  in  S4 ,  the  inverse  of  the 
permutation  �  =  (4, 2, 3, 1)  is  �−1  =  (4, 2, 3, 1)  (so  �  · �  = 14)  and  the  inverse  of 
�  = (3, 1, 2, 4)  is  � −1  = (2, 3, 1, 4).  In  general,  the  inverse  of  a  permutation  �  has  i 
on  the  �i  position. 
3.  From 1 and 2, we see  that the set of permutations Sn  has an  identity element, 
a multiplication  of  elements  and  every  element  has  an  inverse.  In  general,  a  set G, 
together with  an  operation  σ,  which  satisﬁes  the  axioms: 
(1)  σ  is  associative; 
(2)  there  exists  a unit element  e � G,  such  that  x σ e = e σ x = x,  for  all x � G. 
(3)  if x � G,  there exists x−1  � G  (the  inverse) such that x σ x−1  = x−1 σ x = e. 
is  called  a  group.  So  Sn  is  the  group  of  permutations  of  n  (or  the  symmetric 
group). 

4.  One  homework  exercise  asked  you  to  identify  a  connection  between  the  per­
mutation of n and n × n permutation matrices, i.e.  matrices which have a 1 on each 
row  and  column  and  zeros  everywhere  else.  If  � = (�1 , . . . , �n )  is  a  permutation  of 
n,  deﬁne  the  permutation matrix  P�  to  be  the matrix  such  that 
P� (�j , j ) = 1 
and  P� (i, j ) = 0,  if  j  �= �i . 
That  is,  in  the  column  j , we  put  one  on  the  �j  position,  and  zeros  elsewhere.  Note 
that,  a  priori,  one  could  deﬁne  the  permutation  matrix  by  applying  the  procedure

to  rows  instead  of  columns.  But  that  deﬁnition  will  not  behave  well  with  respect 
to multiplication. 
Verify  that  sg(�) =  det(P� )  and  P� ·�  =  P�  · P� .  From  this,  it  also  follows  that 
sg(� · � ) = sg(�)sg(� )  and  that  sg(�−1 ) = sg(�).  In  particular,  the  product  of  two 
even permutations  is  an  even permutation,  and  the  inverse of  an  even  permutation 
is  also  even.  So  the  even  permutations  form  a  subgroup  of  Sn  (note  that  the  odd 
permutations  don’t). 
5.  An  important  class  of  permutations  is  the  transpositions.  A  permutation �  is 
called  said  to  be  a  transposition  (ij ),  if  �i  = j ,  �j  =  i  and  �k  = k ,  for  all  k  �=  i, j. 
Note  that  each  transposition  is  its  own  inverse.  Their  importance  comes  from  the 
fact  that  every  permutation  can  be  written  as  a  product  of  transpositions.  This 
fact  is  not  hard  to  prove  by  induction.  The  idea  is  that,  given  a  permutation  �  of 
n,  the  number  n  appears  in  some  position  in  � ,  say  �j  =  n.  Then  by  multiplying 
�  by  transpositions  we  can  move  n  to  the  nth  position  and  regard  the  resulting 
permutation  as  a  permutation  of  n − 1.  Then  apply  the  induction.  It  would  be  a 
good  exercise  to  try  to  write  down  this  idea  into  a  formal  proof. 
For  example  � = (4, 2, 3, 1) = (14)  and  �  = (3, 1, 2, 4) = (23) · (12). 
There  are  many  other  beautiful  and  important  properties  of  permutations  (for 
example,  the  cycle  decomposition  of  a  permutation),  but  we  will  leave  them  for 
some  other  time.
