At  = 

This  is  a  slightly  diﬀerent  proof  of  the  fact  that  an  invertible  matrix  is 
necessarily  square  without  using  explicitly  the  rank.  Let  A  be  an  m × n 
matrix.  Recall  that  A  is  invertible  if  there  exists  a  matrix  B  such  that 
BA = In  and  AB  =  Im .  We  showed  in  class  that,  if  it  exists,  the  inverse  is 
unique. 
The  transpose  of  A  is  the  matrix  At  deﬁned  as  follows  At (i, j ) = A(j, i).

If  A  is  m × n,  then  At  is  n × m.  For  example,  if  A  =

Exercise  1.  A  is  invertible  if  and  only  if  A t  is  invertible. 
Solution.  Using  the  fact  that  (AB ) t  = B tAt ,  show  that  B  is  the  inverse 
of  A  if  and  only  if  B t  is  the  inverse  of  At . 
Exercise  2.  If  A  is  invertible,  then  A  is  a  square matrix. 
Solution.  Assume A is m×n.  Consider the linear system AX  = b.  Since A 
is invertible, we know the system has a unique solution.  One of the exercises 
in PSet  1  asked  to  show  that  if m < n,  and  the  system  is  consistent,  then  it 
has  inﬁnitely many  solutions.  This  implies  that  in  our  case,  m � n. 
Now,  apply  the  same  argument  for  A t .  At  is  invertible,  so  the  system 
AtX  = b  has  a  unique  solution.  But  At  is  n × m,  and  so  n � m. 
Therefore m = n. 
The  result  proven  in  class  and  this  fact  imply  the  following  characteriza­
tion. 

Proposition.  A  matrix  is  invertible  if  and  only  if  it  is  square  and  it  has 
ful l  rank.
