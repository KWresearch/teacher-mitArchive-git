Let  F  be  a  ﬁeld  and  K � F  be  a  subﬁeld  i.e., K  is  a  ﬁeld  and  also  a  subset  of  F. 
In general, given a ﬁeld F,  then K  is a subﬁeld of F  if  it  is a subset containing 0 and 
1,  closed  under  addition,  multiplication  and  taking  inverses.  The  last  requirement 
says  that  if  x =  0  is  an  element  in  K,  then  the  inverse  x−1  (which  we  know  exists 
in  F)  must  be  in  K. 
A  typical  example  is  F = C  and  K = R.  R  is  a  subﬁeld  of  C.  Other  subﬁelds  of 
{a + b�

are  for  example 
� Q},

2 : a, b 
Q(i) = {a + bi : a, b � Q}. 
An  example  from  ﬁnite  ﬁelds:  recall  the  ﬁeld  of  3  elements,  F3  = Z/3Z,  and  the 
ﬁeld  of  9  elements  F9  = {a + bi : a, b � Z/Z3}.  Then  F3  is  a  subﬁeld  of  F9 . 
If  K  is  a  subﬁeld  of  F,  then  naturally  F  is  a  vector  space  over  K.  We  regard 
the  elements  of  F  as  vectors,  they  have  the  addition  from  F.  Since  K � F,  we  can 
multiply  the  elements  of  F  by  elements  of K.  This  is  the  scalar multiplication.  It’s 
not  always  true  that  F  is  ﬁnite  dimensional  over K. 

Example  1.  C  is  an  R-vector  space.  It  has  dimension  2,  a  basis  is  {1, i}.  This 
is  nothing  else  than  the  usual  representation  of  complex  numbers  as  z  =  a + bi, 
where  a  is  the  real  part  of  z  and  b  is  the  imaginary  part. 
Moreover,  if  V  is  a  complex  vector  space,  then  it  is  a  real  vector  space  as  well. 
This  is  because,  if  V  has  scalar multiplication  by  complex  numbers,  it  has  in  par­
ticular,  scalar  multiplication  by  real  numbers.  If  V  is  ﬁnite-dimensional  over  C, 
of  dimension  n  and  a  basis  {e1 , . . . , en},  then  V  is  ﬁnite  dimensional  over  R,  of 
.  In particular the  space Cn 
dimension 2n  and with  a basis {e1 , . . . , en , ie1 , . . . , ie
n}
is an n-dimensional complex vector space, but  an 2n-dimensional real vector space.

over 

Example 3.  R is a vector space over Q.  It is inﬁnite dimensional (this statement 
is  equivalent  to  the  fact  that  R  is  uncountable,  while  Q  and  therefore  any  ﬁnite 
dimensional  vector  space  over Q  are  countable). 

Example  4.  Let  F  be  a  ﬁnite  ﬁeld.  Consider  the  set  S  =  {1, 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 
1, . . . , 1 + 1 + 1 +  + 1 , . . . }.  Since  this  is  a  subset  of  F,  it  must  be  ﬁnite.  But

this  means  there  exists  an  positive  integer  n  such  that  1 + 1 +  + 1  =  0.  Let  n

n 
be the smallest integer with  this property.  It  is called  the characteristic  of the ﬁeld. 
If  no  such  n  exists,  in  particular  F  would  be  inﬁnite,  we  say  F  has  characteristic  0. 
To  simplify  notation,  we  will  denote  by  k 1  the  element  1 + 1 +  + 1.

The  claim  is  that  for  a  ﬁnite  ﬁeld  the  characteristic  is  a  prime  number.  Assume 
it  is  not:  then  there  exists  n1 ,  n2  positive  integers  such  that  n1 n2  =  n  and  1  < 
n1 , n2  < n.  But  then  0 = n · 1 = (n1  · 1) · (n2  · 1).  Since  F  is  a  ﬁeld,  it  doesn’t  have 
zero  divisors,  and  thus  we  get  a  contradiction  since  both  n1  · 1  and  n2  · 1 = 0  (this 
is  because  of  the  minimality  of  n).

Now,  let  us denote  by  p  (a  prime number)  the  characteristic of  the  ﬁnite  ﬁeld  F. 
The  set  K  =  {0, 1 1, 2 1, . . . , (p − 1) · 1}  is  a  subﬁeld  of  F.  One  needs  to  check

this  claim,  in  particular  the  existence  of  inverses, but  it  is  completely  analogous  to 
the  proof  that  Z/pZ  is  a  ﬁeld,  so  we  will  not  reproduce  it  here.  But  then  by  the 
considerations  above,  F  is  a  vector  space  over K.  Since  F  is  ﬁnite  to  begin  with,  it 
has  to  be  a  ﬁnite  dimensional  K-vector  space,  so  it  is  similar  to  K�  for  some  �. 
The  consequence  is  that  the  number  of  elements  in  any  ﬁnite  ﬁeld  is  a  power  of 
a  prime  number  p  (and  p  is  the  characteristic  of  F).
