18.700.  Problem  Set  7 

Due  date:  November  18  (Friday)  in  lecture  or  in  my  oﬃce 
before  noon  on  due  date.  Late  homeworks  will  be  accepted  only  with 
a medical note or  for some  other MIT  approved  reason.  You may work 
with  others,  but  the  ﬁnal  write-up  should  be  entirely  your  own  and 
based  on  your  own  understanding. 

Each problem is worth 10 points (for the total homework score, there 
will  be  a  normalization,  so  that  all  psets  count  equally). 
Problem  1:  3.4.10 
Problem  2:  3.4.13. 
Problem  3:  3.4.14. 
Problem  4:  3.5.2.  (a),(b),(e) 
Problem  5:  3.5.4. 
Problem  6:  3.5.12. 
Problem  7:  3.5.14. 

The  following  problems  are  recommended  for  additional  practice. 
They  should  not  be  turned  in  with  the  homework  and  they  will  not 
count  towards  the  homework  score.  Section  3.4:  1,2(some  examples), 
5,  7,  11,  12.  Section  3.5:  1(some  examples),  5,  8,  9,  10,  11.
