18.700.  Problem  Set  6 

Due  date:  November  7  (Monday)  in  lecture  or  in my  oﬃce 
before  noon  on  due  date.  Late  homeworks  will  be  accepted  only  with 
a medical note or  for some  other MIT  approved  reason.  You may work 
with  others,  but  the  ﬁnal  write-up  should  be  entirely  your  own  and 
based  on  your  own  understanding. 

Each problem is worth 10 points (for the total homework score, there 
will  be  a  normalization,  so  that  all  psets  count  equally). 
Problem  1:  3.1.7.  in  addition:  “Is  the  converse  true?  (prove  or 
give  a  counterexample)” 
Problem  2:  3.1.10. 
Problem  3:  3.2.1.(b)  and  3.2.2.(b) 
Problem  4:  3.2.9. 
Problem  5:  3.2.14. 
Problem  6:  3.3.4. 
Problem  7:  3.3.13. 

The  following  problems  are  recommended  for  additional  practice. 
They  should  not  be  turned  in  with  the  homework  and  they  will  not 
count  towards  the  homework  score.  Section  3.1:  some  examples  of 
linear  transformations  as  in  1,  8,  and  9;  3a,  4c,  5,  12,  13  .  Section  3.2: 
12,  16,  17,  21,  25,  26.  Section  3.3:  1c,  2c,  5,  6,  9,  10  (choose  some 
examples),  12,  14.
