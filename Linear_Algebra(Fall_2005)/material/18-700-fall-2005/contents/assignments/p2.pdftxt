18.700.  Problem  Set  2 

Due date:  September 26 (Monday) in lecture or in my oﬃce 
before  noon  on  due  date.  Late  homeworks  will  be  accepted  only  with 
a medical note or  for some  other MIT  approved  reason.  You may work 
with  others,  but  the  ﬁnal  write-up  should  be  entirely  your  own  and 
based  on  your  own  understanding. 

Each  problem  is  worth  5  points. 
Problem  1:  0.4.6.(c)  and  (d) 
Problem  2:  0.5.2.(d) 
Problem  3:  0.5.6.  (if  true,  brieﬂy  explain  why;  if  false,  give  a 
counterexample) 
Problem  4:  0.6.11. 
Problem  5:  Show that any 3 × 3 upper triangular matrix with zeros 
on  the  diagonal  is  nilpotent.  Generalize. 
Problem  6:  0.6.12. 
Problem  7:  0.6.16.  (check  only  the  multiplicative  inverse  and  give 
an  example  showing  that  the multiplication  in H  is  not  commutative) 

The  following  problems  are  recommended  for  additional  practice. 
They  should  not  be  turned  in  with  the  homework  and  they  will  not 
count  towards  the  homework  score.  Section  0.4:  4,8,9,12  .  Section  0.5: 
4,7.  Section  0.6:  1(d)(e),4,5,10,17,19,22,23.
