18.700.  Problem  Set  1 

Due  date:  September  16  (Friday)  in  lecture  or  in my  oﬃce 
before  noon  on  due  date.  Late  homeworks  will  be  accepted  only  with 
a medical note or  for some  other MIT  approved  reason.  You may work 
with  others,  but  the  ﬁnal  write-up  should  be  entirely  your  own  and 
based  on  your  own  understanding. 

Each  problem  is  worth  5  points. 
Problem  1:  0.2.2.(c) 
Problem  2:  Are  the  following  systems  of equations  row  equivalent? 
 
 
3X  −  Y  = 0 
X  +  Y  = 0 
�
�
X  + 2Y  = 0 
2X  −  Y  = 0 

Problem  3:  0.2.8. 
Problem  4:  Prove  that any consistent  system  of m linear equations 
in  n variables,  with  m < n,  has  inﬁnitely  many  solutions.  Write  your 
argument  clearly. 
Problem  5:  0.3.6. 
Problem  6:  0.3.10. 
Problem  7:  0.4.2.(d) 

The  following  problems  are  recommended  for  additional  practice. 
They  should  not  be  turned  in  with  the  homework  and  they  will  not 
count  towards  the  homework  score.  Section  0.2:  1-2  (choose  some 
examples),  6,  10,  11,  14.  Section  0.3:  1  (choose  some  examples),  3,  5, 
7,  11,  13.
