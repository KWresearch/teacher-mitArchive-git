18.700.  Problem  Set  8 

Due  date:  December  9  (Friday)  in  lecture  or  in  my  oﬃce 
before  noon  on  due  date.  Late  homeworks  will  be  accepted  only  with 
a medical note or  for some  other MIT  approved  reason.  You may work 
with  others,  but  the  ﬁnal  write-up  should  be  entirely  your  own  and 
based  on  your  own  understanding. 

Each problem is worth 10 points (for the total homework score, there 
will  be  a  normalization,  so  that  all  psets  count  equally). 
Problem  1:  Find the  (upper-triangular) Jordan  form J  and a tran­
sition matrix  P  such  that A = P J P −1 ,  where

They  should  not  be  turned  in  with  the  homework  and  they  will  not 
count  towards  the  homework  score.  Section  4.1:  2,  4,  7,  13.  Section 
4.2:  3,  6,  8,  9,  10.  Section  4.3:  5,  6,  7,  8,  11,  12,  13.
