Due  date:  October  3  (Monday)  in  lecture  or  in  my  oﬃce 
before  noon  on  due  date.  Late  homeworks  will  be  accepted  only  with 
a medical note or  for some  other MIT  approved  reason.  You may work 
with  others,  but  the  ﬁnal  write-up  should  be  entirely  your  own  and 
based  on  your  own  understanding.
