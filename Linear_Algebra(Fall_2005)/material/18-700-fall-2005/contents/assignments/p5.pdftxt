18.700.  Problem  Set  5 

Due  date:  October  24  (Monday)  in  lecture  or  in  my  oﬃce 
before  noon  on  due  date.  Late  homeworks  will  be  accepted  only  with 
a medical note or  for some  other MIT  approved  reason.  You may work 
with  others,  but  the  ﬁnal  write-up  should  be  entirely  your  own  and 
based  on  your  own  understanding.

Problem  2:  2.2.4.  (b)

Problem  3:  2.2.8.

The  following  problems  are  recommended  for  additional  practice. 
They  should  not  be  turned  in  with  the  homework  and  they  will  not 
count  towards  the  homework  score.  Section  2.2:  4(c),7,9.  Section  2.3: 
more  determinants  (as  in  1,2,7),  8,9,10.
