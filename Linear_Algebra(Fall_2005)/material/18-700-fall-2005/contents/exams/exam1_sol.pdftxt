From  the  reduced  echelon  form  on  A,  we  see  that  the  ﬁrst  three 
columns  have  the  leading  ones,  so  the  basis  for  the  column  space  is

Problem  3(28  points)  Answer  the  following  questions  “True”  or 
“False”.  Give  clear  and  concise  explanations  of  your  answers  or  show 
counterexamples.

(a)(7 points)  If  a  vector  space  V  is  n-dimensional,  then  every  subset 
of  V  with more  than  n  elements  is  a  spanning  set  for  V . 
False.  Counterexample:  V  = R2  is 2-dimensional over R, but the  set

, 
is  not  a  spanning  set  for  V .  The  key  observation 
0 
0 
0 
is  that  a  set  with  more  than  n  elements  may  not  contain  n  linearly 
independent  vectors. 

(b)(7 points) The set of polynomials {f1 (X ), f2 (X ), . . . , fr (X )} is lin­
early independent if  the set of polynomials {X f1 (X ), X f2 (X ), . . . , X fr (X )} 
is  linearly  independent. 

True.  Let  a1 f1 (X ) + a2 f2 (X ) +  · · · + ar fr (X )  =  0  be  a  linear  re­
lation  (here  )  means  the  zero  polynomial).  We  want  to  conclude  that 
necessarily  a1  =  a2  =  · · ·  =  ar  =  0.  Then  a1X f1 (X ) + a2X f2 (X ) + 
· · · + ar X fr (X ) =  X  · 0  =  0.  Since  {X f1 (X ), X f2 (X ), . . . , X fr (X )} 
are  linearly  independent,  necessarily  a1  =  a2  =  · · ·  =  ar  =  0,  which 
concludes  the  proof. 

(c)(7  points)  Let  v  be  a  ﬁxed  vector  in  Rn .  The  set  of  m × n  real 
matrices  A  with  the  property  that Av = 0  form  a  real  vector  space. 

True.  Note  that  the  set  in  question  is  not  the  nullspace.  We  verify 
the  axioms  for  the  vector  (sub)space.  The  zero  matrix  0  is  in  the  set, 
since  0  ·  v  =  0.  If  two  matrices  A1  and  A2  have  the  property  that 
A1v = A2 v = 0,  then  (A1 + A2 )v = 0 + 0 = 0,  so A1 + A2  is  in  this  set. 
Also  if  AV  =  0  and  k  is  a  real  scalar,  (kA)v  =  k(Av ) =  k(0)  =  0,  so 
kA  is  also  in  the  set. 

(d)(7  points)  (Recall  that  F2  =  Z/2Z  =  {¯ ¯0, 1}  is  the  ﬁeld  with 
two  elements)  There  exists  a  vector  space  V  over  F2  with  exactly  18 
elements. 

False.  One of the corollaries  to “coordinates with  respect  to a basis” 
was  that  any  n-dimensional  F-vector  space  is  similar  to  Fn .  Since  F2 
here has 2 elements, we conclude that an n-dimensional F2 -vector space 
must  have  2n  elements.  But  18  is  not  a  power  of  2.
