b)  A  basis  of  the  column  space  is  given  by  the  columns  of  A  which  correspond 
to  the  leading  1’s  in R,  so  the  ﬁrst,  second  and  fourth  columns.  A  basis  of  the  row 
space  of  A  is  given  by  the  rows  containing  the  leading  1’s  in  R.  Recall  that  A  and 
R  have  the  same  row  space,  but  not  the  same  column  space  in  general  (note  that 
the  particular  matrix  A  in  this  problem  is  a  bad  choice  for  illustrating  this,  since 
the  rows  are  independent  and  the  column  space  is  all  of  R3 ;  I  apologize).

of  the  matrix.  We  already  have  the  row  reduced  form  of  A,  so  a  basis  for  the

Problem 4.  a) We need to ﬁnd a maximal subset of linearly independent vectors

c) C is a set of three independent vectors in P4 , so by the basis extension theorem, 
we  can  ﬁnd  two  vectors  in  P4  that  complete  C  to  a  basis  of  P4  (dim(P4 ) = 5).  For 
example  w1  = 1  and  w2  = X 3  work.

Problem  5.  By  your  favourite method,  the  determinant  is  7  (for  example,  one 
can  expand  about  the  second  row  and  then  compute  the  resulting  3 × 3  determi­
nants). 

Problem  6.  a) A  is 5 × 5 with even integer entries.  By the permutation formula 
for  the  determinant,  we  see  that  det(A)  is  an  alternating  sum  of  terms  indexed  by 
permutations  of  5,  such  that  every  term  in  the  sum  is  a  product  of  5  even  integers. 
Therefore,  each  term  is  divisible  by  32,  and  so  det(A)  must  be  divisible  by  32.  So 
there  are  no  such matrices  with  determinant  120. 
b)  Assume  the  determinant  of  A  is  160  (note  that  this  is  divisible  by  32).  Then 
A−1  =  det(A) adj (A).  Every  entry  in  adj (A)  is  ±  a  determinant  of  a  4 × 4  matrix 
1
with  all  entries  even  integers,  so  by  a),  16  divides  every  entry  in  the  adj (A).  It 
follows  that  the  largest  possible  denominator  in  A−1  is  10.  An  example  in  which 
this maximum  is  attained  is  for  the  diagonal matrix  A  with  entries  10, 2, 2, 2, 2. 

Problem 7.  Compute T (vi ), i = 1, 3 and write the results as linear combinations 
of  {w1 , w2 , w3 },  e.g.,

Problem  8.  The characteristic polynomial of A is CA (X ) = (X − 2)2 (X + 1), so 
the  eigenvalues  of  A  are  2  (algebraic multiplicity  2)  and −1  (algebraic multiplicity 
1).

Problem  9.  Since  S  is  real  symmetric,  it  is  diagonalizable  and  it  has  real

that  is  S  = QDQt .  The  characteristic  polynomial  of  A  is  Ca (X ) = X (X − 3)2 ,  so

Problem  10.  To ﬁnd  the QR-decomposition of A, we  apply  the Gram-Schmidt 
algorithm  to  A  (note  that  A  is  invertible),  and  keep  track  of  the  coeﬃcients  which 
appear  in  the  (recursive)  formulas. 
Denote  by  v1 , v2 , v3  the  columns  of  A,  w1 , w2 , w3  the  unnormalized  vectors  ob­
tained  in  the  Gram-Schmidt  algorithm,  and  by  u1 , u2 , u3  the  corresponding  nor­
malized  vectors.  u1 , u2 , u3  are  the  columns  of  Q.
