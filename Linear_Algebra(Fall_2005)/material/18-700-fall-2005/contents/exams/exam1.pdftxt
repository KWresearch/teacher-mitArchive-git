“False”.  Give  clear  and  concise  explanations  of  your  answers  or  show 
counterexamples. 
(a)(7 points)  If  a  vector  space  V  is  n-dimensional,  then  every  subset 
of  V  with more  than  n  elements  is  a  spanning  set  for  V .

(b)(7 points) The set of polynomials {f1 (X ), f2 (X ), . . . , fr (X )} is lin­
early independent if  the set of polynomials {X f1 (X ), X f2 (X ), . . . , X fr (X )} 
is  linearly  independent.

(c)(7  points)  Let  v  be  a  ﬁxed  vector  in  Rn .  The  set  of  m × n  real 
matrices  A  with  the  property  that Av = 0  form  a  real  vector  space. 

(d)(7  points)  (Recall  that  F2  =  Z/2Z  =  {¯ ¯0, 1}  is  the  ﬁeld  with 
two  elements)  There  exists  a  vector  space  V  over  F2  with  exactly  18 
elements.
