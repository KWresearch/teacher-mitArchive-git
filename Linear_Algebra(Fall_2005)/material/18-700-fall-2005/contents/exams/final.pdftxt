Instructions:  The  exam  is  closed  book,  closed  notes  and  calculators  are 
not  allowed.  You  will  have  170  minutes  for  this  exam.  The  point  value  of 
each  problem  is  written  next  to  the  problem  - use  your  time  wisely.  Please 
show  all  work,  unless  instructed  otherwise.  Partial  credit  will  be  given  only 
for  work  shown. 
Good  luck!
