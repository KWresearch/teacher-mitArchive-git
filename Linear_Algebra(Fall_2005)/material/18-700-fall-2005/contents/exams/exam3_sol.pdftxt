18.700.  Exam  3.  Fall  2005. 

Problem 1(30 points) Let V  be the vector space of real-valued func­
tions  on R  spanned  by  the  four  functions: 

f1 (x) = sin x,  f2 (x) = cos x,  f3 (x) = x sin x,  f4 (x) = x cos x. 

Let  B  be  the  ordered  basis  (f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 )  of  V  and  consider  the  linear 
transformation 

T  : V  � V , 

T (f (x)) = f (x + � ) + f (−x). 

Recall:  sin(x + � ) = − sin x; 

cos(x + � ) = − cos x. 

(a)  (10  points)  Compute  the matrix  [T ]B . 

We  also  use  that  sin(−x) = − sin x  and  cos(−x) = cos x.

T (sin x) = −2 sin x;

T (cos x) = 0;

T (x sin x) = −�x sin x;

T (x cos x) = −� cos x − 2x cos x.

Then  [T ]B  =

T  is  diagonalizable  if  and  only  if  [T ]B  is  diagonalizable.  CT (X ) = 
(X  +  2)2X 2 ,  so  the  eigenvalues  are  −2  and  0,  both  with  algebraic 
multiplicity  2.

Since  the  geometric  multiplicities  equal  the  algebraic  multiplicities,

T

2 ) sin x, cos x},  and  [T ]C  is  the  diagonal matrix  (−2, −2, 0, 0). 

(c)  (5  points)  Is  T  one-to-one? 

The  kernel  of T  is E0 , which  has dimension  2,  therefore  kerT  ≤= {0}, 
and  T  is  not  one-to-one. 

(d)  (5  points)  Is  the  function  cos x  in  the  image  of  T ?

The image of T  is spanned by {(x+ �

2 ) cos x, sin x} and it is impossible 
to get cos x as a linear combination of these functions, therefore, cos x  /

A = 

(a)  (10  points)  Find  the  values  of  the  parameter  t  � R  for  which  A 
is  not  diagonalizable  over  R. 

We  compute  the  characteristic  polynomial:  CA (X ) = X 2  − tX + 9, 
which  has  discriminant  t2  −  36.  If  |t|  <  6,  CA (X )  doesn’t  have  real 
roots,  so  A  can’t  be  diagonalizable  over  R.  If  |t| >  6,  CA (X )  has  two 
distinct  real  roots,  so  A  is  diagonalizable. 
It  remains  to  analyze  t = ±6.  In  this  case  A  has  a  single  eigenvalue 
with multplicity 2.  We know that such a matrix could be diagonalizable 
only  if  it  is  already  diagonal,  so  A  is  not  diagonalizable. 
The  answer  is:  −6 � t � 6.

(c)  (10 points) Let B  be  a  2 × 2 matrix with  real  entries.  Prove  that 
if B  doesn’t  have  real  eigenvalues,  then  B  is  diagonalizable  over  C. 
Since  the  characteristic  polynomial  must  have  real  coeﬃcients,  by 
the  quadratic  formula,  the  eigenvalues  of B  are  of  the  form  a + bi  and 
a − bi,  with  b  ≤= 0.  Since  B  is  2 × 2  and  has  two  distinct  eigenvalues 
(geom.  mult=alg.  mult.=1),  B  must  be  diagonalizable. 

so  P  = 

Problem  3  (25  points)  Prove  the  following  assertions. 
(a) (9 points) Let A and B  be n × n matrices  such that AB  = A − B . 
If  2  is  an  eigenvalue  of B ,  then  −2  is  an  eigenvalue  of A. 
Let  v  ≤=  0  be  an  eigenvector  of  B  with  B v  = 2v .  Then  AB v  = 
(A − B )v  implies  that  2Av = Av − 2v ,  so Av = −2v ,  which  says  −2  is 
an  eigenvalue  of A. 

(b)  (8  points)  If  N  ≤=  0  is  a  nilpotent  matrix,  then  N  is  not  diago­
nalizable. 
If  N  is  nilpotent,  by  deﬁnition,  there  exists  k  >  0  such  that  N k  = 
0.  Assume  N  is  diagonalizable,  i.e.,  there  exists  P  invertible  and  D 
diagonal, such  that N  = P DP −1 .  Note that D  ≤
= 0, since N  ≤
= 0. Then
0 = N k  = P DkP −1 ,  so Dk  = 0,  contradiction. 

(c)  (8  points)  If  the  operator  T  :  V  �  V  is  diagonalizable,  then  so 
is  the  operator  p(T ),  for  any  polynomial  p(X ). 
Let  B  be  a  basis  of  V  such  that  [T ]B  is  diagonal.  If  p(T ) =  a0 I  + 
a1T  + · · · + anT n ,  [p(T )]B  = a0 In  + a1 [T ]B  + a2 [T 2 ]B  + · · · + an [T n ]B  = 
a0In  + a1 [T ]B  + a2 [T ]2  + · · · + an [T ]B ,  so  [p(T )]B  is  also  diagonal.

There  exists  an  invertible  matrix  P  such  that  A  =  P J P −1 .  Then
