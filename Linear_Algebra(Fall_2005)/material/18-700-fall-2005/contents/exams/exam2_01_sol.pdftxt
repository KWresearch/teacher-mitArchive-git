EXAM  2 

Instructions:  You  will  have  approximately  50  minutes  for  this  exam.  The  test  is  closed 
book, closed notes and calculators are not allowed.  The point value of each problem is written 
next  to  the  problem  –  use  your  time  wisely.  Partial  credit  will  be  given.  You may  use  either 
pencil  or  ink.  If  you  need  extra  paper,  raise  your  hand  (I  also  have  a  stapler  and  paper  clips 
for  attaching  extra  sheets).  If  you  have  any  questions,  raise  your  hand.  Please  show  all work 
unless  instructed  otherwise. 

Problem  1(20  points)  In  each  of  the  following  cases,  you  are  given  a  matrix  with  real 
coeﬃcients.  Calculate  the  determinant  of  each  matrix.  You  do  not  need  to  show  all  steps, 
but  do  say  what  method  you  are  using  to  calculate  the  matrix  (row  reduction,  cofactor 
expansion,  or  by  the  equation  using  permutations).  ⎞

Solution:  Because  this  is  an  upper  triangular  matrix,  the  determinant  is  simply  the 
product  of  the  entries  on  the main  diagonal,  namely  1 × 4 × 6 = 24.

Solution: 
Here  cofactor  expansion  works  well.  We  ﬁrst  expand  in  the  second  column,  since  that  has 
only  one  non­zero  entry.  This  gives  us  that  the  determinant  is  +2det(B [2, 2])  where  B [i, j ] 
is  the  matrix  obtained  by  deleting  the  ith  row  and  j th  column.  For  B [2, 2]  we  notice  that 
the  second  column  (the  third  column  in  our  original matrix)  has  only  one  non­zero  entry.  So 
det(B [2, 2])  =  +1det((B [2, 2])[2, 2]).  Now  (B [2, 2])[2, 2]  is  a  2 × 2  matrix  with  determinant 
11 × 0 − 3 × 4.  So,  altogether  we  have  det(B ) = −1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = −24.

EXAM  2 

Solution:  Here we notice that the fourth row is 3 times the second row.  By n­linearity, we 
may factor the 3 out of the fourth row.  By the alternating property, the resulting determinant 
is  zero.  Thus  det(C ) = 3 × 0 = 0.

5 6 
, B  = 
. 
3 4 
7 8 
These are invertible matrices.  Showing all work and explaining the steps, calculate det(A†B †A−1B−1 ). 
Solution:  We  use  the properties  of  the determinant.  First  of  all,  for  any  2 × 2 matrices C 
and D ,  we  have  det(CD) = det(C )det(D).  Applying  this  three  times,  we  conclude  that 
det(A†B †A−1B−1 ) = det(A† )det(B † )det(A−1 )det(B−1 ). 

A = 

(4) 

(5) 

Now  we  use  the  fact  that  for  any  square  matrix  C ,  we  have  det(C † )  =  det(C ).  Applying 
this  twice,  we  get 
det(A† )det(B † )det(A−1 )det(B−1 ) = det(A)det(B )det(A−1 )det(B−1 ). 
(6) 
−1 . 
Next  we  use  the  fact  that  for  any  invertible  matrix  C ,  we  have  det(C −1 )  =  (det(C ))
Applying  this  twice,  we  get 
−1  (det(B ))
−1  . 
det(A)det(B )det(A−1 )det(B−1 ) = det(A)det(B ) (det(A))
(7) 
But  when  we  gather  terms,  the  factors  det(A)det(A)−1  cancel  to  give  1,  as  do  the  factors 
det(B )det(B )−1 .  Thus  we  ﬁnally  conclude 
det(A†B †A−1B−1 ) = 1.

EXAM  2 

Problem  4 Recall  that  a  permutation  of  n  is  an  ordered n­tuple  σ = (i1 , i2 , . . . , in ) where 
i1 , i2 , . . . , in  are distinct integers with 1 ≤ ij  ≤ n for each j  = 1, . . . , n.  Recall that the sign  of 
a  permutation  σ  is  the  number  sgn(σ)  of  inversions,  i.e.  pairs  (j, k)  such  that  1 ≤ j  < k ≤ n 
and  also  ik  < ij . 
(a)(15  points)  Suppose  that  σ  = (i1 , i2 , i3 )  and  σ �  = (i1

� )  are  two  permutations  of  3.

Form  the  permutation  of  6  which  is  τ  = (i1 , i2 , i3 , 3 + i1
sgn(τ ) = sgn(σ)sgn(σ � ).

Show  all  work  and  justify  your  answer. 

Solution:  Suppose  that  after  applying  a  sequence  of  r  transpositions,  say  (aj , bj ),  then  σ 
has the form (1, 2, 3).  Suppose that after applying a sequence of s transpositions, say (ck , dk ), 
then  σ �  has  the  form  (1, 2, 3).  Then  after  ﬁrst  applying  the  r  transpositions  (aj , bj )  and  then 
applying  the  s  transpositions  (3 + cj , 3 + dj ),  τ  will  have  the  form  (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).  By  the 
axioms  for  sgn,  we  know  that  sgn(σ) =  (−1)r , sgn(σ � ) =  (−1)s  and  sgn(τ ) =  (−1)r+s .  Thus 
we  conclude  that  sgn(τ ) = sgn(σ)sgn(σ � ).

Now  from  the  form  of  C  above,  we  see  that  ci,j  =  0  unless  we  are  one  of  the  two  cases 
1 ≤  i, j  ≤ 3  or  4 ≤  i, j  ≤ 6.  So  the  only  monomials  in  the  formula  of  determinant  which  are 
nonzero  are  those  enumerated  by  permutations  τ  =  (i1 , . . . , i6 )  such  that  1 ≤  ij  ≤  3  for  1 ≤
j  ≤ 3 and 4 ≤ ij  ≤ 6  for 4 ≤ j  ≤ 6.  In  this  case we  see  that  τ  = (i1 , i2 , i3 , 3 + i1

for  unique  permutations  σ  = (i1 , i2 , i3 )  and  σ �  = (i1

Solution:  With  the  same  notation  as  in  (a)  above,  after  performing  the  transpositions 
(3 + ai , 3 + bi )  and  (ci , di ),  we  have  that  τ  is  in  the  form  (4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3).  Now  we  perform 
the  three  permutations  (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)  and  we  get  (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).  Therefore  sgn(τ ) =

Solution:  This  is  similar  to  case  (b)  above,  except  that  now  the  monomial  in  the  deter­
