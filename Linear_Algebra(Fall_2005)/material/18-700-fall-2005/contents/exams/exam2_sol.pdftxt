(the ij th entry of Mn  is the minimum of i and j , n is arbitrary, positive 
integer). 
There  are  two  ways  to  compute  the  determinant  by  row-reduction. 
The  ﬁrst  method  is  to  apply  row  operations  Ri  �  Ri  − Ri−1  starting 
with  the  nth  row  and  moving  up.  In  this  way,  one  ends  up  with  an 
upper  triangular  matrix  with  1’s  everywhere,  including  the  diagonal. 
Therefore  the  determinant  is  1. 
Alternatively,  substract  the  ﬁrst  row  from  all  other  rows  and  then 
expand with respect to the ﬁrst column.  In this way, detMn  = detMn−1 , 
and  by  induction,  since  detM1  = 1),  it  follows  that  detMn  = 1.

Problem 3(27 points) Let P n  be the real vector space of polynomials 
in  the  variable X  of  degree  � n,  with  real  coeﬃcients.

and  C  = {X + 1, X − 1, X 2  + 2X }.  Find  the  change  of  basis matrix  A 
such  that

(f )C  = A · (f )B , 
for  any  polynomial  f  � P 2 . 
A  is  the  change  of  basis  matrix  from  the  basis  C  to  the  basis  B . We 
express that polynomials in B as linear combinations of the polynomials

T (f (X )) = X f �(X ) + f (X ).

Find  the  matrix  associated  to  T  with  respect  to  the  standard  basis  of

P
The  standard  basis  of P n  is  {1, X, X 2 , . . . , X n} .  For  each monomial 
j ,  T (X j ) = (j + 1)X j ,  j  = 0, n. The matrix  [T ]  is  a  (n + 1) × (n + 1) 
X
diagonal matrix  then  with  1, 2, 3, . . . , n + 1  on  the  diagonal.

Problem  4(10  points)  Let  A  be  an  n × n  matrix,  with  odd  integer 
entries  on  the  diagonal  and  even  integer  entries  everywhere  else.  Show 
that A must  be  invertible. 
The  easiest  way  to  prove  this  is  by  the  formula  for  the  determinant 
 
��Sn  sg (� )a1�1 a2�2  . . . an�n . 
in  terms  of  the  permutations.  detA = 
⎜
The  term  corresponding  to  the  identity  permutation  is  the  product 
of  the  diagonal  entries,  so  it  is  odd.  Any  other  term  will  contain  oﬀ-
diagonal  terms,  which  are  even,  and  therefore,  any  other  term  in  the 
sum  is  even.  This  argument  implies  that  detA  is  an  odd  integer,  so 
nonzero.  A  is  invertible.
