PRACTICE  EXAM  FOR   EXAM  3 

Instructions:  Exam   3  will   be  in  lecture   on  Monday,  November  22.  It  will  be  closed  book, 
closed  notes,   and  calculators   will  not  be  allowed.  You   will  have  approximately  50  minutes 
for  the   exam.  You  should  show  all  work,  unless  instructed  otherwise;  partial  credit  will  be 
given  only  for  work  shown.  When  asked  for  justiﬁcation,  your  argument   need  not   be  100% 
rigorous,  but  it  should   be   convincing.

Problem  1(15   points)  For  each  angle  0   ≤ θ <  2π ,  consider   the  matrix  Aθ  ∈ M2×2 (C).

(a)(10  points)  For  each  θ  other  than  θ  = 0,  θ  =  π ,  ﬁnd  the  Jordan  normal  form  of   Aθ . You 
need   not  give  a  transition  matrix  which  puts  Aθ  into  the  Jordan   normal  form,  but  do  justify 
your  answer.

Solution:  We  calculate  the  characteristic  polynomial  cAθ  (X ).   It   is 
cAθ  (X ) = (X   − cos  θ)2  +  sin  θ2  =  X 2  − 2 cos   θ  +  cos   θ2  +  sin  θ2  =  X 2  − 2 cos   θX  +  1. 
Notice  that  if  λ  is  a   solution   of  cAθ  (X ),   then  we  have  (λ  − cos  θ)2  +  sin  θ2  = 0,  i.e. (λ  − 
cos  θ)2  = (i sin  theta)2  .  So  we  must   have  λ  − cos  θ  =  i sin  θ  or  else  λ  − cos  θ  =  −i sin  θ .  This 
gives  two  distinct  eigenvalues,   unless  sin   θ  =  0.  But,  except   for   θ  = 0,  θ  =  π ,  we  have  that 
sin   θ  = 0  (in  our  range  0  ≤ θ <  2π).  Since  we  have  two  distinct  eigenvalues,  by  our   criterion  
� 
� 
for  diagonalizability   we   conclude  that   Aθ  is   diagonaliable,  and  the  Jordan  normal  form  is

not  give  a  transition  matrix  which  puts   Aθ  into  the  Jordan  normal  form,  but  do  justify  your

Solution:  Since  B  is  triangular,   its  characteristic  polynomial  is  simply  cB (X )  = (X  +

Solution:  For  all   operators  C ,  the  characteristic  polynomial  of   C †  equals  the  characteristic 
polynomial   of  C . 
(c)(3  points)   What  is  the  dimension  of  the  eigenspace  E3? 
Solution:  The  eigenspace  E3  is  the  kernel  of  C  − 3I8 .  By  inspection,  this  is  spanned  by 
the   vectors  corresponding   to  the   columns   of  C  where  there  is   a  single  nonzero  entry  of   3,  i.e. 
by  e3  and   e4 .  So   E3  has  dimension  two.

(d)(3  points)  What  is  the  dimension  of  the  eigenspace  E2? 
Solution:  The  eigenspace  E2  is  the  kernel   of  C  − 2I8 .  By  inspection,  this  is  spanned  by 
the   vectors  corresponding   to  the   columns   of  C  where  there  is   a  single  nonzero  entry  of   2,  i.e. 
by  e6  and   e8 .  So   E2  has  dimension  two.

By  inspection  we  conclude  that  the  kernel  is  spanned   by  e2 ,  e3  and  e4 . Thus   ker   ((C  − 3I8 )2 )

Problem 4(30   points)  Let  n  ≥  1  be  an   integer.  A  matrix  E  ∈ Mn×n (C),  E  = (ai,j  ),  is  a

stochastic  matrix  if,  
(i)  for  every  1  ≤ i,  j  ≤ n,  the  entry  ai,j  is   a  nonnegative  real  number,  and 
(ii)  for  every  1   ≤ i  ≤ n,  
n 
=1  aj,i  =  1,  i.e.,   the  sum  of  the  entries  in   every  column   equals 
j
1. 
If  E1  and   E2  are  stochastic  n  × n  matrices,   then  also  the  product  E1E2  is   a  stochastic  n  × n 
matrix.  In  particular  if  E  is  a   stochastic  matrix,  then  for   every  integer   n  ≥  0,  E n  is   also  a 
stochastic  matrix.  
(a)(5  points)  For   every  matrix  E  ∈ Mn×n (C),  for  every  λ  ∈ C,  for  every  λ­eigenvector  for 
E ,  v  ∈ Cn ,  and  for  every  integer  r  ≥ 0,  show  that  v  is   a  λr ­eigenvector   for   E r  . Your   argument 
need   not  be  100%  rigorous,   but  it  should  be  convincing.

Solution:  We  prove  this  by  induction   on  r .  For  r  =  1  the  statement   is  a  tautology.  
Suppose,  by  way  of  induction,   that  the  statement   is  known   for   r  − 1.  Then  we  have 
Ar  v  =  A(Ar−1 v) =  A(λr−1 v) =  λr−1Av  =  λr−1 (λv) =  λr  v .

So  we  conclude  the  result  holds  for   r .  Thus   the  result  is   proved  by  induction  on  r .

Of  course  we  have  Ei,j  vj =  Ei,j  ||vj .  And  since  E  is   stochastic,  each  Ei,j  |  is   at  most  1.

So  we  have  �E v�  ≤

|λ|�v� =  �E v� ≤ n�v�
.
Since  �v�  is  positive,   we  can  factor  it   out  and  we  have  λ ≤ n  as  required.

(c)(15  points)  You   may  assume  (a)  and  (b)  above.  For  every  stochastic   matrix  E  ∈
Mn×n (C),  for  every   eigenvalue  λ  ∈ C  of  E ,  show  that   λ ≤ 1.

Solution:  Suppose  that  v  is  an  eigenvector   of  E  with  eigenvalue  λ.  Suppose,  by  way  of  
contradiction,   that   λ >  1,   say  λ = 1 + �.   Then   for   some  large   integer,  say  M  ≥  �  ,  we  have

that  |λ|M  > n.  Now  by  part  (a),  we  have   that  v  is   an   eigenvector   of  EM  with  eigenvalue  λM  .
