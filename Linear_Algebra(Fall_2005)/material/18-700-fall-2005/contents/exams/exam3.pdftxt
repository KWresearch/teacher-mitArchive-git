Instructions:  The exam is closed book, closed notes and calculators 
are  not  allowed.  You  will  have  50  minutes  for  this  exam.  The  point 
value  of  each  problem  is  written  next  to  the  problem  - use  your  time 
wisely.  Please show all work, unless instructed otherwise.  Partial credit 
will  be  given  only  for  work  shown. 
You may  use  either  pencil  or  ink.  Good  luck!

Problem 1(30 points) Let V  be the vector space of real-valued func­
tions  on R  spanned  by  the  four  functions: 
f1 (x) = sin x,  f2 (x) = cos x,  f3 (x) = x sin x,  f4 (x) = x cos x. 
Let  B  be  the  ordered  basis  (f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 )  of  V  and  consider  the  linear 
transformation 
T  : V  � V , 

T (f (x)) = f (x + � ) + f (−x). 

Recall:  sin(x + � ) = − sin x; 

cos(x + � ) = − cos x. 

(a)  (10  points)  Compute  the matrix  [T ]B . 

(b)  (10  points)  Show  that  T  is  diagonalizable  and  ﬁnd  a  basis  C  of 
V  such  that  [T ]C  is  diagonal.

(c)  (10 points) Let B  be  a  2 × 2 matrix with  real  entries.  Prove  that 
if B  doesn’t  have  real  eigenvalues,  then  B  is  diagonalizable  over  C.

Problem  3  (25  points)  Prove  the  following  assertions. 
(a) (9 points) Let A and B  be n × n matrices  such that AB  = A − B . 
If  2  is  an  eigenvalue  of B ,  then  −2  is  an  eigenvalue  of A. 

(b)  (8  points)  If  N  �=  0  is  a  nilpotent  matrix,  then  N  is  not  diago­
nalizable. 

(c)  (8  points)  If  the  operator  T  :  V  �  V  is  diagonalizable,  then  so 
is  the  operator  p(T ),  for  any  polynomial  p(X ).
