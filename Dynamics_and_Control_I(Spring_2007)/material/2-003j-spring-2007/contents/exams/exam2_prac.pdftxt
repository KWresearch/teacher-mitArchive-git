Exam  2 
2.003 Dynamics  and Vibrations 
This is  a closed book  quiz.  Each student  may  bring  two, sides of an 8;  x 11 inch 
sheet of  self-prepared notes. 

Problem 1 (lOpts) 
Collar B  c a n  slide along rod AC and is attached by  a pin t o  a block  that can slide 
in  the vertical  slot  shown.  The  block  is  acted  upon  by  a  force  P  and  a  torque  M 
is  applied t o  the rod  AC  at  the  pivot  point  A.  All  sliding  and   rotating  contacts  are 
frictionless. 
(i)  Determine the  generalized force conjugate t o  the generalized coordinate 0 .  
( i i )   State t h e  principle  of  virtual  work  and  apply this ;  princi 
determine t h e  
torque M  required  t o  maintain equilibrium.

Problem 2  (10 p t s )  
-  - 
A cart of mass ,V is attach( 
le wall by a spring k. A T-shaped body consisting 
ld  length  L is  pinned  to   thc   center  of  the  cart ,  
of  two  long,  thin  bars  of  mas 
as shown  in  figure  2.  Find   th e   equations of  motion  of  the   system  in terms   of  t ,he  
generalized coordinates x and 3 using  Lagrange's equations.
