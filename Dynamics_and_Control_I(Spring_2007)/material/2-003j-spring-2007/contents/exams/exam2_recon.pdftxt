1.	 A  mass  m  slides  without  friction  along  a  horizontal  guide  as  shown  in  ﬁgure  1.  Motion 
is  restrained  by  a  linear  spring  of  stiﬀness  k  and  unstretched  length  L/2.  Determine 
the  equation  of motion  for  the mass  using  its  horizontal  displacement  x  as  a  generalized 
coordinate.

2.	 A uniform rod of length L and mass m2  is attached by way of a frictionless pin to a sliding 
collar of mass m1  (ﬁgure 2).  The collar slides without friction on a horizontal guide and is 
further restrained by two identical springs of stiﬀness k/2 (x is the extension/compression 
of  the  left/right  springs  respectively).  A  force  of  magnitude  F  is  applied  to  the  rod  in 
such  a  way  that  it  is  always  perpendicular  to  the  rod.  Derive  the  equations  of motion.

3.	 A  uniform  rod  of  length  L  and  mass  m1  is  attached  to  a  cart  of  mass  m2  by  means  of 
a  spring  with  spring  constant  k  (ﬁgure  3).  There  is  a  constant  force  F  that  is  always 
applied perpendicular to the free end.  The nonlinear equations of motion for this system 
in  terms  of  the  generalized  coordinates  θ  and  x  are:

Identify  the  equilibria  and  derive  the  linearized  equations  for  small  perturbations  about 
the  equilibria  (you  do  not  have  to  solve  these  equations).
