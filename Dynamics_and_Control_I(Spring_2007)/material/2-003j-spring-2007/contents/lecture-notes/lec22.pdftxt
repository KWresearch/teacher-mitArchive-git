Motivation


Figure  1:  2  degrees  of  freedom.  Spring  with  mass  on  end.  The  mass  rotates  in 
both counterclockwise and clockwise directions.  The spring extends and retracts 
by  varying amounts.  Sometimes  only  the  spring moves with  the mass  relatively 
still;  sometimes  only  the  mass  rotates.  What  is  happening?  Figure  by  MIT 
OCW.

and  Two  Masses

System  is  equivalent  to  a  single  4th  order  equation. 

Rather  than  solving  this,  we  prefer  to  keep  a  system  of  equations.  Use  matrix 
notation  as  this  then  allows  us  to  use  to  use  tools  from  linear  algebra.

To make  the  system nontrivial, we make the  equations  linearly dependent  (they 
say  the  same  thing). 

If: 

(k1  + k2  − mω 2 ) 
−k2 
, 
(k1  + k2  − mω 2 ) 
−k2 
Then  the  two  equations  are  just  multiples  of  each  other.

This  sets  a  ratio  of  c1  and  not  absolute  values.

which  is  just  the  determinant  of  the  matrix.

We  will  not  prove  this,  but  number  of  degrees  of  freedom  equals  the  number  of

natural  frequencies.


To  ﬁnd  c1  and  c2  for  each  frequency,  we  use  equations  (4)  and  (5).
