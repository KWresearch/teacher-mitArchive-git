The  angular  velocity  of  the  rigid  body: 

ω  is  a  property  of  the  body. 

ω = 

dθ

dt 

ω  is  independent  of  the  choice  of  ’painted  line’  or  the  reference  ﬁxed  direction

Body

For  any  point  on  the  body  P: 

v = ω × r

More  generally,  for  any  vector R  on  the  body: 

R = r2  − r1

Often  we  have  a  combination  of  rotation  and  translation:

Bar CD:  Motion  is  a  combination  of  rotation  and  translation.

At  any  point  in  time,  we  may  locate  CD  by  locating  the  point  C.  (Covers  the

translation)  and  identify  the  angle  θ  the  CD makes with  the  horizontal.

Angular  velocity  is  ωCD  =  dθ eˆz
dt 

ωCD  is  independent  of  choice  of  point  C.  Bar  has  intrinsic  rotation. 

The  motion  of  a  rigid  body  is  expressed  as  a  combination  of  translation  of  a 
point  ﬁxed  on  the  body  and  rotation  about  an  axis  passing  through  this  point 
→  need  (x,  y ,  θ).


(In  a  rigid  body,  particles  are  constrained  to  be  the  same  distance  apart.)

Aside: 

Figure  6:  Angular  velocity  is  not  aﬀected  by  location  of  direction  line  and 
painted  line.  Although  the  direction  line  and  painted  line  are  diﬀerent  than 
those  in  Figure  5,  the  angular  velocities  are  the  same.  Suppose  you  had  a 
diﬀerent point E, with  a  direction  line  and painted  line  as  shown.  The  relation-
dθ 
dθ 
ship  is  ω  =  dt eˆz  =  dt eˆz .  This  independence  of  the  angular  velocity  from  the 
choice  of  direction  line  and  painted  line  is  explained  in Williams,  James H.,  Jr.

of  the  body  needed  for  the  angular momentum  principle.

We  can  express  the motion  of  any point  on  a  rigid  body  in  terms  of  translation 
of  another  point  on  the  body  and  a  rotation  about  that  point.

Figure  7:  A  rotating  rigid body with  two  selected points P  and G. The  velocity 
at  point  P  can  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the  velocity  at  point  G  plus  a  term 
to  represent  the  rotation  of  the  point  P  around  the  point  G.  The  term  is  the 
cross product of  the  angular velocity with  the  vector r , which  is position vector 
pointing from G to P. The angular velocity is set by the ﬁxed reference direction, 
the painted line, and the rate at which the angle between those two lines changes.

If  you  have  (xG ,  yG ,  θ),  then  the  state  of  your  rigid  body  is  uniquely  deﬁned. 
Complete  set  of  coordinates. 

A  complete  set  of  coordinates  may  not  be  independent;  however,  due  to  geo ­
metric  constraints.

Example:  Rolling  Hoop 

Figure  12:  Rolling  hoop.  Hoop  rolls  without  slipping.  Mass  m  is  attached  to 
the  hoop.  Figure  by MIT OCW. 

Want  to  specify  the  position  of  the  mass. 

Pick  c  as  the  reference  point. 

xm  = xc  − r sin θ 
ym  = yc  − r cos θ 
xc ,  yc ,  θ  form  a  complete  coordinate  system. 
But  there  are  2  constraints  on  the  surface. 
1.  Rolls  on  surface 
2.  Rolls  withoug  slipping  (no  sliding) 

3  coordinates,  2  constrained.  Therefore,  only  1  generalized  coordinate  is  re ­
quired  to  describe m. 

1.	 Rolls  on  surface 

2.	 No  Slip: 

yc  = r 

= 0  for  no  slip

vB  = vC  + ω × rCB

Figure  13:  Hoop  rolls  along  x-direction  where  distanced  travelled  equals  rθ. 
Figure  by MIT  OCW. 

This  statement means  the  displacement xc  is  equal to  the part of the  hoop’s 
circumference  rθ. 
Thus,  we  can  choose  a  single  generalized  coordinate  to  describe  the  state  of 
the  system.  θ  chosen! 

xM  = rθ − r sin θ 

yM  = r − r cos θ 

This  completely  deﬁnes  the  system. 

Note:  If  slipping  is  allowed, need xc  and  θ  to  describe  state  of  the  system.  This 
is  because  the  hoop  could  slide  (translate without  rotation).
