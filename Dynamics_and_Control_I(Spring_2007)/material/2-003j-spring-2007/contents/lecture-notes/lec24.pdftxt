{c1}  and  {c2}  are  vectors  describing  the  modes  shapes  for  the  free  response.

ω1  and  ω2  are  the  two  natural  frequencies  of  oscillation.

Constants A1 ,  A2 ,  φ1 ,  and  φ2  are  set  by  the  initial  conditions.

For more  information  on  free  response,  see  lectures  21,  22,  and  23.

For  the  particular  solution,  we  will  restrict  the  guess  further.

This guess assumes phase change of 0 or π .  Acceptable, because  the  system has 
no  damping.  Justify  with  a  1-D  example.

x = Re  Xe(iωt) =  |X| cos(ω t − φ) 
This allows 0 < φ < π because cx˙ term however, in the case mx¨+ kx = F0 cos ω t, 
one  is  restricted  to  guessing  x = X cos ω t.

Cart  1  is  stationary  and  only  Cart  2 moves.  Figure  by MIT  OCW.

As  ω  goes  over  ω2 ,  starts  at −∞,  then  decays  to  0.

Cart  2  still  exhibits  oscillatory behavior.  Figure  by MIT  OCW.

As  ω → ω1 ,  increase without  bound.

As  ω → ω2 ,  but  just  above  ω1 ,  negative.  As  ω → ω2 ,  approach −∞.

As  ω → ω2 ,  comes  from ∞  down  to  0.

At  ω3 ,  ﬁrst  cart  is  stationary.  Anti-resonance  (mass  2  sees  mass  1  as  a  rigid

wall).


Figure  4:  m  is  not  moving  so  mass  2  sees  a  “wall”  at  mass  1.  How  does  this 
occur?  The  forcing  is  equal  and  opposite  to  the  forces  provided  by  the  strings. 
Figure  by MIT  OCW. 

Adding  damping  will  make  the  matrix  inversion more  complicated. 

Real  life  examples  of  dynamics  and  vibrations  include  the  Tacoma  Narrows 
bridge collapse, nonlinear deep sea ocean wave formation and breaking, and dy ­
namic pattern formation in nature (for  example, shifting  formations of starlings 
in  ﬂight).
