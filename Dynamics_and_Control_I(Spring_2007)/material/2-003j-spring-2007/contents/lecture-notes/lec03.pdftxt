Example  2:  Particle  on  String  Pulled  Through

Hole


Figure 1:  Particle on string pulled  through hole.  Tabletop with hole B. A string 
comes  out  with  an  attached  mass.  The  particle  is  traveling  around  with  an 
angular  velocity  θ˙.  Figure  by MIT  OCW. 

Assume:  Frictionless  surface.  Inextensible  String. 

Pull  string  through  hole  at  B  such  that: 

r(t0 ) = L 
r(t1 ) = L/2 

dr 
dt (t0 ) = 0

dr
 (t1 ) = 0 
dt 

If  θ˙(t0 ) = θ˙ 0 ,  what  is  θ˙(t1 ) = θ˙ 1 ?

Discussion 

If  we  use  linear momentum,  will  need  to  describe  forces  between m  and  string. 
Thinking  about  angular momentum  about  the  point  B: 

τ B  = h˙

B  + vB  × mv ←  Angular momentum  principle 
hB  = r × mv =  Angular Momentum 

Now: 

τ B  = r × F  ←  Forces  acting  on  particleτB  = 0  because  r  � F 

τB  = h˙
B  + vB  × mv ⇒  Angular momentum  about  B  is  constant  h˙

B  = 0. 

τ B  = 0  (from  above)

vB  = 0  because  B  is  not  moving

∴ hB  =  Constant


In  Cartesian Coordinates 

r = r cos θˆ
ı + r sin θjˆ
r = −mrθ˙ sin θˆı + mrθ˙ cos θjˆ
p = mv = m ˙
a.  hB (t0 ) = r × p = LmLθ˙ 0kˆ(kˆ is  unit  vector  in  z-direction:  out  of  page). 
2 θ˙ 1kˆ

2 m L 
b.  hB (t1 ) =  L 
2 4θ˙ 0  = 2Lθ˙ 0 .

Setting  (a) =  (b):  θ˙ 1  = 4θ˙ 0 ,  and  velocity  of  particle  v1  = 2v0  =  L 

Energy  is  not  conserved:  why?  The  pulling  force  (tension)  does  work.


Dynamics  of  systems  of  particles 

Forces  on  each  particle  may  be  composed  as  follows


F i

= F ext  + F int
