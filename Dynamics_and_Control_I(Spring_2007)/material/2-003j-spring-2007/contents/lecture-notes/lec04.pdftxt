τ ext :  Total  External Torque

From  now  on,  τ ext  = τ B .
B 

If  τ B  =  0  and  vB  = 0  or if  B  is  the  center  of  mass  or  if  vB  �  vC  then  H B  = 
constant  (Conservation  of  Angular Momentum). 

You may  be  familiar  with  τ B  =  d  H B  (only  valid  if  vB  = 0  or  vB  � P ).

Angular momentum H B  of  a  collection  of  particles  about  point  B  is  given  by: 

H B  =

where  hBi  = r i  × miv i . 

If  (H B )  is  the  sum  of  the  angular  momenta  of  the  individual  particles  about 
point  B,

Therefore, we  write: 

� 
H B  = H C  + rc  × P 
Notice  that  vB  does  not  appear  in  this  equation. 

The  angular momentum  about B  is  the  angular momentum  about  the  center  of 
mass (C) plus the moment of the system linear momentum (M vC  = P ) about B. 

We  will  use  these  equations  for  rigid  bodies.  With  rigid  bodies  will  need  to  use 
moments  of  inertia.

Therefore, W int  must  be  0  (or  if  you  show  that  internal  forces  do  no  work).

No  rotations  involved.  Probably will  not  need  angular momentum. 

Kinematics 

Describe  the  motion  (kinematics) without  forces 
Knowing  the  location  of  A  is  equivalent  to  knowing  the  location  of  the  center 
of mass  of M.

rB  = xˆı + seˆs  = xˆı + s cos θˆı + s sin θjˆ

rA  = xˆı
r˙B  = x˙ ˆı + ˙s cos θˆı + ˙s sin θjˆ

r˙A  = x˙ ˆı
r¨B  = x¨ˆı + ¨s cos θˆı + ¨s sin θjˆ

r¨A  = x¨ˆı
Note:  Generalized  coordinates.  ˆı  and  ˆes  are  not  ⊥. 
Important  to  deﬁne  coordinates.

move  horizontally  without  friction.  If  mass  (m)  is  released  from  rest  at  the  l 
position,  ﬁnd  the  velocity  of mass  (M )  at  the  moment  (m)  reaches  the  bottom 
of  the  incline.  Figure  by MIT OCW.
