Learning  Ob jectives 

You might comment, “I’ve seen this material before in 18.03, 8.01.”  You will use 
knowledge from previous courses including diﬀerential equations and mechanics. 
After  this  course,  you will  be  able  to: 

1.  Apply  knowledge  to  new  problems 

2.  Deﬁne  coordinate  system 

3.  Obtain  equations  of motion 

4.  Solve  equations

Inertial  Frame  of  Reference

I.  1st  Law  - A  particle  remains  at  rest  or  continues  to  move  in  a  straight  line 
with  constant  velocity  if  there  is  no  resultant  force  acting  on  it. 

II. 2nd Law - A particle acted upon by a resultant force moves in such a manner 
that  the  time  rate  of  change  of  its  linear momentum  is  equal  to  the  force. 

�
where  F  is  the  force, m  is  the  mass,  and  a  is  the  acceleration. 

 
F  = ma  for  a  single  particle. 

III. 3rd Law - Forces that result from interactions of particles and such forces be ­
tween two particles are equal  in magnitude,  opposite  in direction, and collinear.

Inertial  Frame  of  Reference 

dp 
Newton  II:  Requires  the  concept  of  an  ”internal  frame  of  reference” because  dt 
depends  on  reference  frame  in which motion  is  observed (this  is  not  so  for mass 
of  particle  or  the  force  applied  to  the  particle.) 

An internal reference frame must be non-accelerating.  What is non-accelerating? 
(Newton  I) 

Absolute  inertial  frame  is  where  Newton  I  holds  and  is  an  idealized  situation. 
Surface  of  earth  is  good  enough  (for  short periods  of  time:  ∼minutes).  Earth  is 
rotating.  If  particle  followed  long  enough,  will  curve.  (Fictitious  force,  coriollis 
eﬀect). 

Deﬁnitions  of  Velocity  and  Acceleration 

The  velocity  of  a  particle  B  is  the  time  rate  of  change  of  its  position.

Velocities  and  accelerations  can  be  expressed  using  a  variety  of  diﬀerent  coor ­
dinate  systems.  Here  are  two  examples. 

In  Cartesian  (rectangular)  coordinates  (x,y):
