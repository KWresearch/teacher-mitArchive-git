Example:  Rolling  Cyinder  with  a  Hole 

Find  the  equation  of motion  for  a  cylinder with  a  hole  rolling without  slip  on  a 
horizontal  surface.  In  the  hole  with  center  A,  R2  = R/2.

Kinematics 
2  Constraints:  1.  Rolling  on  surface  2.  No  slip  condition 
Use  1  generalized  coordinate  θ  to  describe  the  motion 
Only  need  1  equation. 
For  this  example,  we  wil l  use  the  work-energy  principle  to  obtain  the  equation. 

1.  Gravity  is  a  potential  force. 
2.  Normal force on ob ject:  At point of contact, velocity  is zero so no work done. 

No  work  done  by  external  forces  therefore  T  + V  =  constant. 

2 IC |ω |2 .  Need  center  of  mass.  Where  is  the  center  of  mass?

Kinetics 
Center  of  Mass  Calculation 

First  ﬁnd  position  of  center  of mass. 

We  know  the  center  of  mass  of  disc  without  hole:  Point  O.  Can  think  of  the 
hole  to  be  “negative mass.”

We  want  to  ﬁnd  IC

First  ﬁnd  I cwh  around O.  Then  shift  to  C  with  the  Parallel-Axis Theorem.

Equation  of motion:  motion  is  complicated. 

Alternative Approach:  Using Angular Momentum (Sketch) 
Angular momentum  about moving  point  B. 

B  is  not  on  cylinder.  B  is  not  on  ground.  B  is  contact  point  between  ground 
and  cylinder.

τ B  =  H B  + vB  × P

τ B :  Torque  due  to  gravity

P  = M vC 

1.  Still  have  to  ﬁnd  velocity  and  location  of  center  of mass. 
2.  Still  have  to  ﬁnd  IC . 
3.  But,  even more  work  because  need  to  take  torques.
