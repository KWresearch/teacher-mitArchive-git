Alternative  Method  to  Derive  Linearized  Perturbation  Equations  4 

For θe  = arccos (  g  ),  the  equilibrium point  exists  for  g  = Ω2  and  then  θ  grows 
aΩ2 
a 
as  Ω2  increases.  The  equilibrium  point  is  stable. 
This  system exhibits  stability behavior known as a pitchfork bifurcation.  At 
ﬁrst,  the  mass  oscillates  about  θ  =  0.  As  Ω  is  increased  towards  Ω2  =  g/a 
those  oscillations  continue  until  Ω2  >  g/a.  At  that  point,  the  mass  rises  to 
arccos g/aΩ2  on  one  side  of  the  hoop.  θ  continues  to  increase  but  it  will  not 
reach  π  or  −π .  Because  perturbation  can  cause  the  mass  to  rise  either  at  θ  or 
−θ,  the  behavior  is  called  a  bifurcation. 

Alternative Method to Derive Linearized Perturbation 
Equations 

This  method  makes  approximations  at  the  level  of  the  Lagrangian.  Then  one 
diﬀerentiates  to  obtain  linearized  equations  of motion.  Do  not  use  this  method 
if  there  is  any  uncertainty  about  the  equilibrium  points.  This method  does  not 
give  the  nonlinear  equations  of motion  needed  to  ﬁnd  the  equilibrium  points.

Alternative Method: 
1.  Assume  equilibrium  solution  is  known. 
2.  Consider  small  changes  to  the  variables. 
3.  Expand  L  up  to  its  quadratic  terms. 
4.  Use the approximate L in Lagrange’s Equations to obtain linearized quations 
for  stability  analysis.

Changes  in  the  control  parameter  determine  what  will  happen. 

Bifurcations:  Turn  up  often  in  nonlinear  dynamics.
