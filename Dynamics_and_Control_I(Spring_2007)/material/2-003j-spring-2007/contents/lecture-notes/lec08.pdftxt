Instant  Centers  or  Instantaneous  Centers


“Point  on  a  rigid  body  whose  velocity  is  zero  at  a  given  instant” 
Instantaneous:  May only have zero velocity at the instant under consideration. 
Idea:  If  we  know  the  location  of  an  instant  center  in  2D  motion  and  we  know 
the  angular  velocity  of  the  rigid  body,  the  velocities  of  all  other  points  are  easy 
to  determine. 

Figure  1:  Rigid  body  where  I  is  the  instant  center.  Figure  by MIT  OCW. 

vA	 =  vI  + ω × r IA 
=  0 + ω × r IA 

(1) 

vA  = ω × r IA 
So  body  is  undergoing  rigid  body  rotation  about  I. 

How  to  locate  an  instant  center? 
1.  Draw  lines  in  direction  of motion  of  two  points  on  a  rigid  body. 
2.  Draw  perpendiculars  to  both  these  lines  at  points.

3.  I  is  the  intersection  of  perpendiculars.

Proof 

vI  = vA  + ω × rAI 
(ω  is  angular  velocity  of  rigid  body.) 

ω × rAI :  Vector  is  ⊥  to  rAI .  Direction  of motion  is  parallel  to motion  of A. 

v I  = vB  + ω × rBI 
ω × rBI :  Vector  is  ⊥  to  rBI .  Direction  of motion  is  parallel  to  motion  of B. 
Cannot  satisfy  both  of  these  unless  vI  = 0.  (I  is  the  instant  center.) 

Note:  The  instant  center  may  not  actually  be  a  point  on  the  rigid  body.  This 
simply means that the body is instantaneously rotating about an external point. 
The  instant  center  can  change  in  time. 

Example:  Rolling  Disk 
What  is  the  velocity  of  point  A? 

Assume  no  slip.

Point  I  marks  the  contact  with  disk  and  ground:  no  slip,  not  moving  for  an 
instant  because  ground  is  still.

vB  = vA  + ωAB  × rAB
