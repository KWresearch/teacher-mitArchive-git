Admissible  Variations/Virtual  Displacements


Virtual Displacement:

Admissible  variations:  hypothetical  (not  real)  small  change  from  one  geometri­
cally  admissible  state  to  a  nearby  geometrically  admissible  state.

Generalized  Coordinates 
Minimal,  complete,  and  independent  set  of  coordinates 

s  is  referred  to  as  complete :  capable  of  describing  all  geometric  conﬁgurations 
at  al l  times. 
s  is  referred  to  as  independent :  If  all  but  one  coordinate  is  ﬁxed,  there  is  a 
continuous  range  of  values  that  the  free  one  can  take.  That  corresponds  to  the 
admissible  system  conﬁgurations.

attached to  it.  On  the  cart  is  a pendulum  that has a  torsional spring  (kt ) and a 
torsional  dashpot  (ct ).  There  is  a  force  applied  to  m  that  is  a  function  of  time

4  degrees  of  freedom:  2  constraints.  Cart  moves  in  only  1  direction.  Rod  ﬁxes 
distance  of  the  2  particles. 

Thus, there are a net 2 degrees of freedom.  For 2.003J, all systems are holonomic 
(the number of degrees of freedom equals the number of generalized coordinates).
