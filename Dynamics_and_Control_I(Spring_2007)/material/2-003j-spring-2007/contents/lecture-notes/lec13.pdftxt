Lecture  Outline 

Solve  one  problem  by  Newtonian  and  Lagrangian Methods. 
“Lagrangian approach  is  simple  but  devoid  of  insight.” 
Both methods  can  be  used  to  derive  equations  of motion.

Critique  of  Newton’s  Method 

Critique: 
Did  the  reaction  forces  do  any  work?  Did  the  reaction  force move? 
N  did  not move.  F  applied  but  point  did  not  move  at  point  of  contact. 
No  work  done  by  those  forces. 

1.  Had  to  explicitly  deal  with  non-contributing  forces.  Newton’s  Laws  are  de ­
rived  in  cartesian  coordinates,  but  problem’s  answer was  not  in  cartesian. 
2.  Newton’s  laws are written  in Cartesian coordinates, but we  really care about 
conﬁgurational parameters. 
3.  Had  to  write  several kinematic  constraints  to  reduce  unknowns  x  and  y . 

Schematic  of  Newton  versus  Lagrangian  Approach

Generalized  Coordinates


Figure  4:  Left.  Generalized  coordinate  for  bead  on  wire.  For  a  bead  moving 
along  a  wire,  one  generalized  coordinate,  the  distance  along  the  wire,  can  be 
used  to  describe  the  position  instead  of  the  two  Cartesian  coordinates  x  and 
y.  Right.  Generalized  coordinate  for  a  two  beam  system.  In  the  system  of 
connected  bars  OP  and  PQ  driven  by  a  motor  at  Q,  there  is  only  one  degree 
of  freedom.  Thus,  an  angular  coordinate  such  as  theta,  angle  of  OP  with  the 
x-axis,  or  phi,  angle  between OP  and  PQ,  completely  describes  the  coordinates 
of  the  rigid body.  If  one was not  using  generalized  coordinates,  one would  need 
x,y-coordinates  at  points  O,  P,  and Q.  Figure  by MIT  OCW. 

Only  1  degree  of  freedom  in  both  cases 

Newton:  x,  y  for  each  of  points  O,  P ,  and  Q.  φ  would  also  work.  θ  is  a 
generalized coordinate;  it  naturally,  completely,  and  independently  describe  co ­
ordinates  of  the  rigid  body. 

The  generalized  coordinates  of  a  system  (of  particles  or  rigid  body  or  rigid 
bodies)  is  the  natural,  minimal,  complete  set  of  parameters  by  which  you  can 
completely  specify  the  conﬁguration  of  that  system. 

Lagrange  Method 

We  have  already  seen  a  generalized  force.  Where?  Torque.

#  coordinates = #  degrees  of  freedom

Non-Contributing  Force  Comments 

Lagrange  leads  to math  for  2  and  3  degrees  of  freedom  problems. 

Figure  6:  Block  sliding  along  incline.  Two  forces  are  present,  a  reaction  force, 
R,  and  a  gravitational  force, mg .  Figure  by MIT OCW.

Closing  Comments 

Lagrange  is  used  when  forces  are  all  conservative.  We  can  also  use  Lagrange 
when  there  is  friction,  for  example,  but  then  the  equations  involve more  math. 
Lagrange works best  for  systems where  all  contributing  forces  are  conservative. 

Notice that Lagrange ignores noncontributing forces; the coordinates are natural 
instead  of  Cartesian,  and  it  was  not  necessary  to  supply  additional  equations 
as  kinematic  constraints,  so  all  of  the  critiques  of  Newton  were  answered  by 
Lagrange.
