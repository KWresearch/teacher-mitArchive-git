Impulses 

Large  forces  acting  over  a  short  period  of  time


Impulsive  forces  result  in  an  instantaneous  change  of  velocity  (linear  momen­
tum)

Key  Points 

All other forces (e.g.  gravity, dashpot damping) are considered negligible during 
impact. 

As  the  time  interval  shrinks,  the  eﬀect  of  these  ﬁnite  forces  becomes  negligible. 

By  direct  analogy,  for  rotational  systems  one  can  have  torques  of  an  impulsive 
nature.  The  impulsive  torque  changes  the  angular momentum. 

τ  = ΔH δ(t) 

 

t=0+ 

�
t=0− 

ΔH δ(t)dt = ΔH  where ΔH  is  the  change  in  angular momentum  of  the  system.

Forces  between  the  colliding  spheres  are  impulsive  (all  other  forces  make  no 
contribution).

Impulse  on m1  (acts  to  the  left):  m1 (v1  − v1 ). 
� 
Impulse  on m2  (acts  to  the  right):  m2 (v2  − v2 ). 

By  Newton’s  Third  Law  (Impulse  given  to  m1  is  equal  and  opposite  to  the 
impulse  on m2 .  Action  and  reaction  are  equal  and  opposite.) 

� 
� 
m1 (v1  − v1 ) = m2 (v2  − v2 ) 

� 
� 
m1v1  + m2v2  = m2v1  + m2v2

Linear momentum  is  conserved. 

Note that this  is not enough to solve for the  result of a collision (Two unknowns

v1 ,  v2 ;  but  only  one  equation).


We  need more  information.  Obtained  from  experiment.


Is  energy  conserved?  →  Yes,  energy  is  conserved  in  universe!


Is mechanical  energy  conserved?  → Not  in  general.


Typically K Eaf ter  < K Ebef ore :  Where  does  it  go?

Let  tA  be  the  time  that  they  ﬁrst  impact.  Then  they  will  deform  slightly  and 
at  time  tB  their  centers  of mass  will  be  in  closest  proximity.


At  time  tB  the  relative  velocity  of  the  centers  of  mass  is  zero;  they  both  have

velocity  vB .


The  ob jects  move  apart  at  time  tC .

Collision  in  the  Reference  Frame  of  Center  of

It  is  interesting  to  view  the  collision  in  the  reference  frame  of  center  of mass.

Velocity  of  center  of mass  is  the  same;  does  not  change  during  collision.

In  the  center  of mass  frame  p = 0. 

What  do  we  see  in  the  center  of mass  frame?

As  a  result  of  the  collision,  masses  change  direction  and  velocities  reduce  by  a

factor of e.  For e = 0, the masses stick together and remain stationary  in center 
of mass  frame.
