a  frictionless  surface  and  the  ramp  also  acts  on  a  frictionless  surface  as  well.

Free  Body  Diagrams  (FBDs) 

System: 

Figure 2:  Free body diagram of block on ramp.  The forces present are a reaction 
force, R,  and  the  forces  due  to  gravity  on  both  bodies, M g  and mg .  Figure  by 
MIT OCW. 

Separately: 

Because we are not trying  to  calculate each  force, apply  linear momentum prin­
ciple  so  that  N  does  not  appear.  Use  system. 

Linear  momentum  principle 

To  system: 

d 
F  =  P 
dt 
No  forces  in  x-direction.  (F )x  = 0  ⇒  Linear  momentum  in  the  x-direction  is 
conserved. 

M x˙ + m( ˙x + ˙s cos θ) = constant = 0 

(1) 

constant =  0  because  system  initially  at  rest. 

We  recognize  that  our  system  momentum  equation  is  a  consequence  of  taking

each  individual  equation  together.


We  have  two  variables  x  and  s.  So  we  need  2  equations  using  x˙ and  s˙ .  (An

expression  for  velocities).

Note:  For  individual masses,

Figure 3:  Free body diagram of block on ramp analyzed seperately as individual 
components.  A  normal  force  N  acts  on  both  bodies.  The  force  due  to  gravity 
mg  acts on the block  and the  force due  to gravity M g  acts on the  ramp.  Figure

Already used  linear momentum,  now must  either  choose  conservation of  energy 
or  angular momentum.  Try  conservation  of  energy  ﬁrst. 

We  can  use  conservation  of  energy  because  all  external  forces  are  potential  or 
do  no  work.  (No  friction,  gravity, R  does  no  work  because  ⊥  to motion). 
And  interntal  forces  (N)  do  no  work.

This  is  the  general  relation  for  the  system  in  any  conﬁguration  after  the  mass 
m  has  been  released  from  rest  at  y = 0. 

Combine  Linear  Momentum  Principle  and  Conservation  of  Energy 

Our  particular  interest  is  for  s = 0.

We  need  another  equation  because  we  have  two  variables.  Could  consider  con­
servation of energy, but instead, we will use the principle of angular momentum.

Angular Momentum  Principle  Apply  about point A.  Any  forces at A will 
generate no torque.  N  generated no torque either because it acts through center 
of mass  A.
