For  2-D  motion,  ω · ρ  =  0  because  the  vectors  are  ⊥.  For  3-D,  this  term  does 
i 
not  have  to  be  0.

If  one  takes  angular momentum  about  the  center  of mass:

H c  = Icω 

(Angular  Momentum  about  B)  =  (Angular  Momentum  about  C)  +  (Moment

Therefore:

Cue  hitting  a  pool  ball 

A  pool  ball  of  radius  R  and  mass  M  is  at  rest  on  a  horizontal  table.  It  is  set 
in motion  by  a  sharp  horizontal  impulse  J  provided  by  the  cue.  Determine  the 
height  above  the  ball’s  center  that  the  cue  should  strike  so  that  the  subsequent 
motion  is  rolling without  slipping. 

Figure  4:  Cue  ball  diagram.  Diagram  shows  cue  ball  when  force  if  ﬁrst  applied 
and  after  being  hit.  Figure  by MIT  OCW.

Satisfying  Constraints 

If  there  is  no  slip,  one  needs  ω (0+ )R = vC (0+ )
