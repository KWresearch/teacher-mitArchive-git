Not  conservative.  m  experiences  same  force  as  long  as  velocity  is  same. 
Position  independent.  The  constant  c  meanst  this  is  linear  dashpot  behavior. 
If  all  forces  are  potentiall  or  the  ones  that  are  not  do  work  (e.g.  always 
perpendicular  to  motion)  we  call  the  particle  motion  ”conservative”  because 
mechanical  energy  (kinetic  +  potential)  is  conserved. 
Discussion: 

F  = F conservative  + F non−conservative 
Using  conservation  of mechanical  energy  can  be  useful 
1.  Scalar  Equation 
2.  Need  not  account  for  forces  that  do  no  work 

Example  1:  Vehicle  Falling  on  a Curve 
A  small  vehicle  is  released  from  rest  at  the  top  of  a  circular  path.  Determine 
the  angle  θ0  to  the  position  where  the  vehicle  leaves  the  path  and  becomes  a 
pro jectile. 

(Neglect  friction  and  treat  vehicle  as  a  particle.) 

Problem  relates  to  driving  a  car  down  a  hill. 

Whenever  you  solve  a  problem, make  sure  that  you  draw  a  good  diagram.

Figure  6:  Free  body  diagram  of  vehicle  falling  along  curve.  The  two  forces  on 
the vehicle  are  the normal  force, N ,  and  the  force due  to  gravity mg .  Figure by 
MIT OCW. 

When  does  this  car  become  free?  When  N  is  zero,  the  vehicle  has  left  the 
surface.  How  does  the  point  of  departure  (θ)  depend  on  R  or m?

Vehicle  will  leave  track when  N  = 0 

−mg cos θ0  = −mR θ˙2 
Rθ˙2  = g cos θ0 
(This  is  true  only  when  N  = 0.  We  want  to  know  θ˙2  = f (θ)?) 

Could use Equation  (2)  to  get  information about  θ˙2  by  integration, but  instead

we  will  use  conservation  of  energy  to  get  a  relation  θ˙2  = f (θ)

Forces:

Gravity  - Conservative

No  Friction

Normal  Force:  N  is  always ⊥  to motion.  Does  no  work.


We  have  a  conservative  system.

Apply  conservation  of mechanical  energy.
