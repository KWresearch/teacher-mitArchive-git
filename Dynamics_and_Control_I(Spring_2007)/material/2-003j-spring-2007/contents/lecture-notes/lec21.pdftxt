What  actually  happens  is  set  by  ζ  and  ωn . 

xp  can  be  thought of  as  the  steady  state  response  once  the  transients die  down. 

So  we  will  now  focus  on  the  steady  state  response.  Of  particular  interest  is  the 
frequency  response  (i.e.  response  amplitude  and  phase  as  a  function  of  forcing 
frequency.

Analysis  For  ω → ∞ 

If  one  forces  the  system  too  fast,  system  cannot  respond. 
|X| → 0,  limω→∞  tan φ = 0

completely  out  of  phase.  Cart moves  in  opposite  direction  from  forcing.  Figure

Notice  ωmax  is  less  than  ωn . 

Figure  5:  Summary  graph  of  X  vs.  (ω/ωn)  for  forced  response.  X  starts  out  at 
1  when  (ω/ωn)  equals  zero,  and  φ  equals  0.  Then  X  goes  through  a  maximum 
at  (ωmax/ωn ), which  is  less  than  1.  At  (ω/ωn)  equals  1, φ  equals π/2, X  equals 
F0/k .  X continues to diminish and approaches zero for large (ω/ωn) and φ equal 
to  π .  The  dotted  line  is  the  observed  behavior  when  ζ  =  0,  which  corresponds 
to  no  damping.  Figure  by MIT  OCW.
