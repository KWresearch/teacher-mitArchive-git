These  equations  are  highly  non-linear. 

In  general,  the  equations  of  a  real-world  system  will  be  highly  nonlinear,  what 
can  we  do  analytically?

Equilibrium  Analysis 
Let  us  look  for  equilibrium  points.

Finding  Equilibrium  Points 
Set  velocities  and  acceleration to  zero  (Remaining  generalized  coordinates have 
values  constant  in  time). 

x˙ = x¨ = θ˙ = θ ¨ = s˙ = ¨s = 0 

For  (1),  0 = 0 
For  (2),  g sin θ = 0 
For  (3),  −mg cos θ + k(s − l) = 0 

In general, the equations can be much more complex:  3 nonlinear coupled equa ­
tions  to  be  solved  simultaneously  (can  try  fsolve  in MATLAB) 

Solve:

Explaining  their  physical  meaning 

θ0  = 0:  Spring  and  pendulum  hanging  vertically  down

0 = 0 means  cart  can  take  any  x  value  as  long  as  the  cart  is  at  rest.

Analyzing  Their  Stability 
Close  to  their  equilibrium  points,  nonlinear  systems  behave  like  linear  systems. 
Thus,  if  we  linearize  the  equations  of  motion  about  those  static  equilibrum 
points  and  analyze  the  linearized  system  mathematically,  we  can  draw  conclu­
sions  about  the  nonlinear  system’s  behavior  and  stability.

If  we make  a  small  disturbance,  what  happens? 

Imagine  x <<  1,  θ0  <<  1,  s =  s0  + �  where  � <<  1.  �  is  a  small  perturbation 
away  from  s0 . 

Linearize  by  keeping  only  linear  terms.
