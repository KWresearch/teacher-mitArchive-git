Coordinate  System:  x,  θ:  Generalized  coordinates.  Chosen  to  describe  system 
well. 

Kinematics 

rB  = (x + L sin θ)ˆı − L cos θjˆ

rA  = xˆı
r˙B  = ( ˙x + Lθ˙ cos θ)ˆı + Lθ˙ sin θjˆ

r˙A  = x˙ ˆı
r¨B  = ( ¨x + Lθ ¨ cos θ − Lθ˙2  sin θ)ˆı + (Lθ ¨ sin θ + Lθ˙2 cos θ)ˆj

r¨A  = x¨ˆı
Do  not  want  to  introduce  unknown  forces. 

Kinetics 

Linear Momentum  in  x  direction 

−kx = M x¨ + mx¨ + mL θ ¨ cos θ − mL θ˙2  sin θ 

(1) 

(Fspring  = FM ,x  + Fm,x ) 
Need  another  equation:  Angular  momentum  for  this  case.  Could  also  use  con­
servation  of  energy. 
Angular Momentum:  Choose A  because  only  mg  has moment  about  A. 

d 
τ A  =  H A  + vA  × P 
dt 

τ A  = −mgL sin θkˆ
No moment  for M  about  A  because  A  is  the  center  of mass  of M . 

H A	 =  AB × mr˙B 
= (L sin θˆı − L cos θjˆ) × m[( ˙x + Lθ˙ cos θ)ˆı + (Lθ˙ sin θ)]ˆj 
= (mL2 θ˙ + mL x˙ cos θ)kˆ

vA  × P	 =  x˙ ˆı × (M x˙ ˆı + m( ˙x + Lθ˙ cos θ)ˆı + m(Lθ˙ sin θ)ˆj) 
=  mL x˙ θ˙ sin θkˆ

Notice:  All  torques  in  kˆ direction. 

Substitute  and  simplify.

Discussion 
Now  we  have  2  equations  in  2  unknowns.  How  do  we  solve?  Simulate  with

MATLAB.  This  system  has  certain  vibrations.

Equations  are  nonlinear.


Examples  of  Linear Terms:  x˙ ,  θ˙,  x¨,  θ¨,  x,  θ

Combinations  of  variables:  Nonlinear

Operations  of  variables:  cos θ,  sin θ,  θ2 ,  θ˙2  (Nonlinear)


In  Equation  1:  Nonlinear  terms  are Lθ˙ cos θ  and −Lθ˙2  sin θ

In  Equation  5:  Nonlinear  terms  are mLx¨ cos θ  and mgL sin θ


Equation  1  and  Equation  5  contain  intricate  dynamics.


1965:  Edward  Lorentz  at  MIT  - made  a  breakthrough  in  equations  predicting

weather.  Ran  simulations  on  3  equations.


He  could  never  get  the  same  results  twice.  Uncertainty  with  initial  conditions,

especially  due  to  vacuum  tubes  used  then.

Any  small  uncertainties  can  be  ampliﬁed  by  equations.  “Butterﬂy  eﬀect.”

How deterministic  is  the  universe.  Not  fully  deterministic.  Cannot  know  initial

condition  exactly.  H.U.P.  (Heisenberg  Uncertainty  Principle).  Then  nonlinear

equations  come  in  and  give  diﬀerent  results.


Simulation 

To  simulate,  reorganize  equations  1  and  5.  First  rewrite  (5)  as 

¨  −1 
( ¨x cos θ + g sin θ)
θ = 
L 

.

Then  substitute  into  Equation  1:


x¨(M  + m + m cos 2  θ) + mg sin θ cos θ − mL θ˙2 sin θ + kx = 0 
Use  Equation  6  to  substitute  for  x¨ in  Equation  5  and  obtain: 
 
 
mL θ˙2  sin θ − kx − mg sin θ cos θ 
�
�
θ¨(mL2 ) + mL cos θ 
+mgL sin θ = 0 
M  + m + m cos2 θ 
To  solve  these  numerically:

Simplest  is  Euler  step-method  for  solving. 

In MATLAB,  you will  use:

Rest of course:  Will have some mathematical analysis of the equations of motion 
to  acquire  understanding  separate  from MATLAB.
