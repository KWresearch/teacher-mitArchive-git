Kinematics 

Rigid  Body  Dynamics  - 2.003J 
Eﬀects  of Newton’s  Laws  on  particles 
Particles  attached  rigidly  (constrained  to move  together) 
2.005,  2.006:  Flow 
Continuum Mechanics  (Heat:  Vibration  of  particles) 
2.001 
Connected  but  not  rigid 
Change  distance  elatically 

Kinematics  underlies  dynamics. 

Newton’s  Laws 

F  = ma →  Single  Particles →  Multiple  Particles


action =  reaction


Kinematics 
No  gravity.  Newton’s  Laws  do  not  apply. 
Related  to  geometry  (in  cartoonland).  Geometry  without  Newton. 

Standing  on  ﬂoor.  Do  not  move  because  ﬂoor  stops  you.  Still  have  gravity 
though.  Kinematic  constraint. 

Figure  1:  Standing  in  a  corner,  one  throws  a  frisbee.  The  bug  crawls  along  the 
frisbee.  Figure  by MIT  OCW.

What  is  its  velocity  and  acceleration? 

What  do  you  need? 
Need  to  know  how  fast  frisbee  is  moving  (Initial  Velocity  and  Angular  Ve ­
locity).  Air  drag  is  dynamics  (force). 
Why  do  we  care? 
Spaceship  spinning,  revolving  around  earth,  astronaut  stuck  by  magnetic 
boots 
Need  to  know  center  of mass movement  in  time. 

Figure 2:  x(t) and y (t) describe the frisbee position as a function of time.  Figure 
by MIT  OCW. 

x(t), y (t), l(t), θ(t) What  is  the  velocity?  Acceleration? 

Find  position  function,  then  diﬀerentiate. 
Use  vectors. 

r C F  = ˆıx(t) + ˆjy (t)  Corner  to  Frisbee 
r F S  = ˆıl cos θ + ˆj sin θ  (Stop  writing  (t)) 
Suppose  x(t) =  y (t)  =  0.  rC F  =  rF S .  Frisbee  spinning  on  ﬁgure.  Suppose 
drF S 
x(t), y (t)  �
0  then  dt

would  give  velocity  of  bug  as  v  � were  hovering  over

C F 
frisbee  as  it  moves.  r
is  position  of  frisbee  center  of  mass.  dt ˆı  = 0.  ˆı  is 
d
stationary  because  room  is  stationary.  (Frame  is  stationary). 

C S  = ˆı[x + l cos θ] + ˆj[y + l sin θ] 
r 
Derivative  of which  equation?  Depends  on  frame  of  reference.

2l˙θ˙ sin θ:  Coriolis.  Earth  is  spinning.  If  run  fast,  inexplicable  drift  to  right. 
“Fictitious  force.”  Hurricanes  only  spin  1  way  in  northern  hemisphere.

lθ˙2 cos θ:  Centripetal Acceleration 

Just  found  acceleration  and  velocity  of  this  frisbee  and  bug.

Physicists  took  200  years  to  solve  this,  because  they  would  leave  out  terms.


Naval  Battles:

- Gunners  noticed  guns  would  be  oﬀ. 
- Got repointed when gunners crossed equator 250 - 300 years ago.  Discovery 
of  coriolis  eﬀect.
