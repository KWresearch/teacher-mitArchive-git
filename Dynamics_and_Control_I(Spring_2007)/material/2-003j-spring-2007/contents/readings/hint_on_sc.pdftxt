Hint on Spherical Coordinates

There is a reference to spherical coordinates Problem 2 in Problem Set #1. Here is a 
clarification on how to proceed. 

The problem gives you the velocity of the aircraft in the x direction. The dimensions are 
given to you in Cartesian coordinates, which are natural for the pilot. However, the plane 
is being tracked by a radar. The natural coordinates for a radar are spherical. The problem 
asks you to express the velocity of the aircraft in terms of unit vectors attached to the 
spherical coordinate system. 

Here’s something that might help you. The diagram 
θ  and  e$
R  ,  e$
below shows e$
φ , the unit vectors in the 
spherical system, with respect to those in 
Cartesian coordinates, namely  i$ ,  $j and  k$ . The two 
can be related to each other with some basic 
trigonometry and projections. For example: 

$j  =  e$ R  cos θ cos φ−  e$
φ cos θ sin φ+  e$
θ  sin θ . 

You can come up with similar expressions for  i$ and  k$  in terms of  e$
you do, you have the necessary machinery to answer Question 2.
