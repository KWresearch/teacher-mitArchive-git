Computation Lab Structure
(1) Lab Assignments – you will be given an exercise
to do during laboratory period.  You must email
the TA the solutions before you leave the lab.  It 
is vital that you first read the assigned reading
before the lab session.  We are here to
help but not write the codes for you.  
(2) Computation based homework problems

(3) Project – In 4 lab sections, you will write a
comprehensive program to perform simulation
of the dynamics of a system.  A list of possible
projects with explanations will be posted later
in the semester.

The computation assignments are a significant
Portion of your homework grade!!!
