***** Course Meeting Times *****
Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session
Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session
Laboratories: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session
***** Description *****
We will start by applying Newton's Laws and Work-Energy principles to the
motion of single particles, systems of particles and rigid bodies in planar
motion. Then we use virtual displacements and virtual work to introduce
Lagrange's formulation of the equations motion for systems of particles and
rigid bodies in planar motion. We will uncover a system's equilibrium points
and perform linear stability analyses. Lastly, we consider free and forced
vibrations of linear multi-degree of freedom models of mechanical systems.
Throughout the course, we will use MATLABÂ® to practice numerical methods for
solving dynamics and vibrations problems.
***** Goals *****
After this course you will be able to:
    * Apply knowledge of 8.01 and 18.03 to new problems
    * Define a coordinate system for the system under consideration
    * Derive equations of motion using either Newton's momentum principles or
      Lagrange's equations
    * Analyze the equations of motion for the existence of equilibrium points
      and characterize the stability of those points
    * Solve the equations of motion
***** Prerequisites *****
The prerequisites are Physics I (8.01) and Differential Equations (18.03).
***** Related Courses *****
After this course, related courses include:
2.004 - Dynamics and Control II
2.050J/12.006J/18.353J - Nonlinear Dynamics I: Chaos
2.032 - Dynamics

***** Examinations *****
There will be two mid-term exams (1.5 hours each) scheduled 2 days after Ses
#L12 and 5 days after Ses #L19. The final exam is 3 hours long.
All the exams (including the final) will be closed book. One sheet of
handwritten notes will be allowed at the first mid-term exam, two sheets at the
second mid-term exam, and three sheets at the final exam.
There will be two optional review sessions, one before each mid-term exam.
***** Recitations *****
The purpose of the recitations is to give students experience in the subject by
working out examples and expanding on the material presented in the lectures.
Attendance and participation in the recitations is obligatory.
***** MATLABÂ® *****
There will be MATLABÂ® sessions on Friday, covering material relevant to the
course and problem sets. In addition there will be MATLABÂ® office hours to
help with the homework materials. Typically, the MATLABÂ® problem to be worked
through on Friday will be distributed through the course website earlier in the
week.
***** Homework *****
Homework problems will typically be assigned every Monday and will be due at
the beginning of lecture on Monday of the following week. The problem sets will
be provided in the assignments section. No late homework will be accepted. You
may discuss the problems with others in class, but you must (a) write up your
eventual solution independently, and (b) list the names of students with whom
you discussed the problem set. Problem sets may contain a MATLABÂ® component.
