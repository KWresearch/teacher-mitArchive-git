no longer than 2 pages, exclusive of resumes, and should outline the team’s preliminary 
plans for the project.  Bidders will be notified by October 12 if they have made the short 
list, and successful bidders will be asked to submit a full technical plus cost proposal by 
December 7, 2007.  Details of the proposal follow. 
 
 
BACKGROUND – PURE HOME WATER 
 
Pure Home Water (PHW) is a social enterprise and legally registered non-profit 
organization in Ghana founded in 2005 and supported with two-year start-up funds by the 
Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. PHW’s first goal is to provide safe drinking water to 
people through dissemination of household drinking water treatment and safe storage 
(HWTS) products in Ghana, with a special focus on low-income households in Northern 
Ghana, where drinking water conditions are the most dire in the country. PHW’s second 
goal is to become locally self-sufficient and financially self-sustaining. PHW is the first 
organization of its kind in Ghana.  In broadest terms, PHW intends to learn, by trial and 

 

1

error, the process of scale up of HWTS in an extremely challenging environment 
(multiple tribes and local languages, strong religious identities  - Christian, Moslem, 
traditional-  poverty, water scarcity, low population densities).   
 
In Year 1, PHW began by selling a range of HWTS, but it soon became apparent that 
because of our limited capacity (2 full-time local staff in Year 1 with no prior experience 
of HWTS -- these products barely existed in Ghana at the time), we could promote and 
disseminate one product well, or many products poorly, so we narrowed our focus to the 
ceramic Potters for Peace-type pot filter, which PHW has locally branded as the Kosim 1  
filter. We focused solely on the Kosim filter in Year 2 because in our judgment the Kosim 
filter is currently a good choice, culturally, technically, financially, socially,  also given 
the challenging conditions of the particular water sources, such as dugouts and river 
water, which are commonly used as drinking water sources by people in Ghana, 
especially in the North.  While we currently promote and market the Kosim filter, MIT 
teams, which support PHW with research and development studies and monitoring and 
evaluation assessments, have actively researched additional water treatment and storage 
products to add to PHW’s product line. This research can be accessed at:  
http://web.mit.edu/watsan/meng_ghana.html.  PHW’s mid-term goal is to market a range 
of household or community scale water treatment and storage products successfully – this 
RFP’s individual projects support that effort.  
 
 
CONDITIONS IN GHANA 
 
Three documents provide the reader with a good overview of the conditions in Ghana: 
 
Introduction to Ghana – presents key information and data on the environment, 
population demographics, culture, economics, water/sanitation and health as it pertains to 
Ghana generally and the Northern sector of Ghana specifically – this is provided in the 
accompanying PowerPoint Show. (Annex A). 
 
Ghana and the Millennium Development Goals for Water/Sanitation  - reviews the 
current status of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for water and sanitation 
(Goal 7, Target 10) in Ghana. This is provided through an excerpt from Michael Forson 
of UNICEF-Ghana (Annex B) and Table 1 below: 
 
 
 
 
 

                                                 
1 Kosim is a Dagbani work meaning “water from a ceramic pot” and “the best water.” It is the drinking 
water that is served to guests.

3.3 Water Quality of Dugout Water in Northern Region, Ghana). This is a “Photo Tour” 
of the dams/dugouts and the people whose drinking water comes from these sources, 
together with a map of the locations in Tamale District only (Annex C). 
 
The water quality conditions of surface waters in Northern Ghana are difficult for those 
who have not witnessed them to appreciate. Dams/dugouts and other surface waters 
manifest typical high coliform concentrations seen in many developing country situations, 
but atypically, they manifest extremely high turbidities, which are a big challenge to 
effective water treatment. While the WHO recommends that the median turbidity should 
ideally be below 0.1 NTU for effective disinfection, the turbidities of surface water 
supplies that are consumed as drinking water by the many people in Ghana and especially 
the Northern Sector of Ghana are frequently above 50 NTU, and turbidities can reach as 
high as 1,000 NTU to 2,000 NTU. Moreover, these surface water supplies are also 
contaminated with coliform and other microorganisms. Tables 2a and 2b gives data on 
these water quality conditions.

These data indicates that one cannot simply disinfect the water as a sole treatment step, 
for example via chlorination or solar disinfection, because such applications typically 
assume low source water turbidities. A particle removal step via sedimentation, 
coagulation/flocculation and/or filtration is essential when treating such waters. This has 
been an important realization of the PHW team, as we have sought to provide safe 
drinking water through products that “do the job.” The Kosim filter is one such product.

MASTER OF ENGINEERING PROJECTS 
 
Now in its third year of existence, Pure Home Water has a good foundation regarding 
local environmental and social conditions, as well as a grasp of the viable and promising 
household and community-scale water treatment and safe storage options. This RFP 
seeks to expand the knowledge base of water treatment and storage options. All projects 
will involve interface with local hosts and users who have varying degrees of knowledge 
and experience with PHW products, and also potentially with Sloan School of 
Management’s Global Entrepreneurship team(s), and/or MIT’s Poverty Action Lab.  A 
successful bid on this project can be on project topics provided below and/or the bidders 
are encouraged to propose their own specific projects based on their interests and talents. 
High priority projects #3, #4 and #10 are designated as such in the individual project 
titles below.  
 
CHARACTERIZATION AND MAPPING 
 
1.  Physical, Chemical and Microbiological Water Quality Characterization of 
Dugouts 
 
Dugouts (also known locally as dams) are water supply structures that collect rainwater 
and intermittent stream flow water. They were reputedly built by Peace Corps and other 
international aid groups, beginning in the 1960s, to supply water in the water-scarce 
savannah and Sahel environments of Sub-Sahara Africa and elsewhere. Dugouts are a 
primary drinking water supply source in many Northern Region districts of Ghana. For 
example, in Savelugu and Tolon Districts, more than 50% of water to households is 

 

5

obtained from dugouts. Although originally introduced from outside, these structures 
have become widely embraced by local people as a readily available water source. 
Despite their acceptance, there are several dramatic unintended consequences of this 
intervention. First, dugouts are breeding grounds for the Cyclops that is the vector of 
guinea worm. Second, they supply water not only for human domestic use but also water 
for cattle and other animals. Third, their high turbidity makes this source difficult to treat. 
This project would involve a study of the physical, chemical and microbiological 
characteristics of these water structures.  
 
2. GIS Mapping of Unimproved Water Sources including Dugouts and Kosim Filter 
Dissemination among Communities Using those Sources in Northern Region, Ghana   
 
Several M.Eng and other students working on this project, Jenny VanCalcar, Rachel 
Peletz, Sophie Johnson, Kelly Doyle and Mathilde Lerminiaux, have collected GPS data 
and/or created maps of various aspects of water quality and PHW Kosim filter 
dissemination in the Northern Region of Ghana. This project would entail expansion of 
the work of mapping improved and unimproved sources of water, including dugouts as 
well as Kosim filter and other water treatment dissemination efforts. The researcher 
would be teamed with a local translator and guide who would travel from village to 
village. This sub-project would potentially entail living under challenging local 
conditions in traditional villages (sleeping in huts, eating local food, potential exposure to 
insects, unsanitary food and poor quality drinking water). The researcher electing this 
project should read the thesis of VanCalcar (http://web.mit.edu/watsan -> Ghana and 
discuss the capacity to handle the challenges, especially potential health consequences, 
with the project supervisor. Alternatively, this project could be performed in conjunction 
with several of the other studies listed below. 
 
 
DESIGN, TREATMENT, ASSESSMENT 
 
3. *** PRIORITY PROJECT ***    
Performance, Consumer Preference, Proper Use and Sustained Use of the Ceramic 
Pot (Kosim) filter + Chlorine Disinfection with Aquatabs. 
 
A technically “ideal” household drinking water treatment system would take out turbidity 
and disinfect. One of the current best household options for achieving this under the 
environmental conditions of Northern Ghana is the ceramic pot (Kosim) filter combined 
with the household chlorine product, Aquatabs, by manufactured by Medentech. This 
project will look at several major aspects of this “ideal” household treatment system for 
Ghana – its technical performance via water quality testing, consumer preference for 
either product, both products together or neither product, and product sustainability 
including proper use and adherence (“sustained use”).

Two distinctly different demographics will be considered: urban (modern) households 
and rural (traditional) households. Modern homes in Ghana are typically of concrete or 
brick construction, have a concrete or other floor and tin or tile roof, and have access to 
some form of “improved” water supply and adequate sanitation facility. Traditional 
households are of mud-brick, thatch roofs, with dirt floors. Traditional households often 
do not have access to an “improved” water supply and, lacking any sanitation facility, 
practice open defecation. 
 
A randomized study design may be applied to this project, following the guidance of 
MIT’s Poverty Action Lab. 
  
4. *** PRIORITY PROJECT *** 
Comparison of Two Chlorine Products - Aquatabs vs. HTH Calcium Hypochlorite 
for Application in Ghana 
 
In order to ensure microbiologically safe drinking water, a disinfection process needs to 
accompany a particle separation process (sedimentation and/or coagulation and/or 
filtration are the three simplest particle separation options)  In prior research by Master of 
Engineering (M.Eng) and Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) Masters students, 
solar disinfection options which were innovative variations on SODIS (solar disinfection 
in PET plastic bottles) have been  investigated and dismissed as viable household-scale 
disinfection approaches on account of challenging local conditions: high turbidity source 
waters and Harmattan dust storms from November - March and rainy season conditions 
from June – August both of which are substantially blocking in-coming solar radiation 
(See Master thesis work of Iman Yazdani and Melinda Foran at: 
http://web.mit.edu/watsan/meng_ghana.html) 
  
The logical disinfection approach in Northern Ghana that can complement filtration of 
water, via ceramic filtered water via Pure Home Water’s Kosim filter, the biosand filter, 
or some other product,  is chlorination. There are two potential products available in 
Ghana at this time. One is Aquatabs, which utilize the active ingredient sodium 
dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC), also known as sodium troclosene and sodium dichloro-s-
triazine trione. The other is HTH dry calcium hypochlorite, packaged in granular form, 
(chlorine content of 68%), manufactured by Arch Chemicals and locally distributed by 
Dagyeis Co.  
 
This project would entail a comparison of these two products on the basis of performance, 
cost and appropriate application. Whereas Aquatabs can be applied either at the 
household scale,  HTH calcium hypochlorite is designed for community-scale 
applications only. This project could potentially interface with a similar project currently 
underway in Western Kenya, lead by a team from Harvard and UC-Berkeley.

5. Comparison of Indigenous Practices of Sedimentation and Alum Coagulation 
with Proctor and Gamble’s PuR. 
 
Indigenous practices embody local knowledge regarding methods to improve water 
quality. The two chief indigenous methods of water treatment observed in Ghana include 
sedimentation by gravity settling in large clay storage vessels, and alum coagulation on a 
seasonal basis using a local alum product. This project would entail detailed investigation 
of the advantages and disadvantages of the local practices versus application of the 
Proctor & Gamble product, PuR. Performance, proper use, social acceptability and 
willingness to pay are the key factors of interest in this project.   
 
6. Design Modification of the Biosand Filter for Treatment of High Turbidity 
Waters 
 
International Aid is a Christian charity involved in dissemination of an injection-molded 
plastic biosand filter in Ghana and several other countries. The biosand filter has proved 
to be efficacious in numerous settings, however, it has not been proven under the 
challenging conditions of high turbidity waters in Northern Ghana. Slow sand filters, of 
which biosand filters are a sub-category, are meant to handle turbidities no greater than 
50 NTU.  No known data exists on the performance of biosand filters under high turbidity 
conditions. 
 
Multi-stage filtration is a drinking water treatment process successful in handling high 
turbidity water. This project could entail one or two parts: an investigation of the 
performance of the International Aid biosand product under turbid conditions and/or the 
design, pilot testing and comparison of a variation on the biosand filter that draws design 
insight from centralized multi-stage filtration systems applied in Peru and elsewhere, but 
never yet adapted to household scale. The researcher who selects this project will be 
offered specific guidance and also put in touch with the work of a Geraldo Galvis (2004).  
 
 
OPERATION AND MAINTENCE, MONITORING AND EVALUATION 
 
7. Standardizing Training on Proper Operation and Maintenance of the Ceramic 
Filter 
 
The Potters for Peace type ceramic pot filter, of which Pure Home Water’s locally 
branded Kosim filter is one example, has expanded its reach into eight countries over the 
past ten years. Locally manufactured versions can now be found in the following 
countries: Cambodia, Ecuador, Ghana, India, Nepal, Nicaragua, Thailand, Vietnam 
 
Moreover, early stage pilot manufacturing and dissemination is occurring in the 
following seven additional countries: Colombia, Dominican Republic, Indonesia, 

 

8

Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, Yemen.  
 
While a manual has been written and while training materials have been freely shared 
among implementers, to date there has not been any systematic attempt to standardize 
instruction and training in proper operation and maintenance. This project would begin 
with a literature review and collection of training materials, proceed with a field survey 
of the O&M methods used to train users of the Kosim filter and would then determine 
best practices for ceramic pot filter disseminators. This project would entail extensive 
contact with ceramic pot filter implementers around the world. It would also involve the 
development of training materials that would be posted on the MIT water/sanitation 
and/or the Potters for Peace Web sites.    
 
8. Monitoring and Evaluation Framework for Household Drinking Water 
Treatment and Safe Storage Dissemination 
 
This project could interface with the Global Monitoring and Evaluation of Household 
Drinking Water Treatment and Safe Storage M.Eng.team project. It will propose a 
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework for household drinking water treatment and 
safe storage (HWTS) in Ghana, and pilot test a set of monitoring and evaluation 
indicators. It will apply this framework and set of indicators to the Kosim filter, Aquatabs, 
cloth filter and biosand filter dissemination efforts to date in Ghana. This will be a 
potential model for other HWTS M&E efforts beyond Ghana, especially those by the 
World Health Organization’s International Network to Promote Household Drinking 
Water Treatment and Safe Storage.  
 
9. Rainwater Harvesting in Northern Region, Ghana  
 
This project would be offered in collaboration with the Rwanda team’s rainwater 
harvesting project. Northern Ghana is located in a savannah zone, which is a semi-arid 
area receiving between 900 – 1100 mm/year.  Rainwater harvesting has been promoted in 
Northern Ghana by the Presbyterian Church, with whom our project has a close working 
relationship. The exact nature of this rainwater harvesting project is “to be determined.” 
Background to rainwater harvesting in Ghana in terms of this season’s conditions is as 
follows:  Ghana experienced poor rainfall from the onset of the rains during June.  In mid 
July rainfall became very heavy, causing localized flooding in Northern Ghana and 
throughout West Africa. While precipitation has lately become significantly reduced, 
there are now concerns of widespread crop failures beginning to emerge from Northern 
Ghana. This erratic pattern of rainfall clearly has a bearing on the role of rainwater 
harvesting structures in supplying or supplementing water for domestic and/or 
agricultural purposes. One potential project would be to survey the households using the 
newly installed rainwater harvesting systems to find out what role rainwater plays in their 
water supply usage patterns.

IMPLEMENTATION  
 
10. *** PRIORITY PROJECT ***   
Consumer Choice of a Wide Range of Household Drinking Water Treatment 
Systems 
 
This project is a consumer choice study related to perceived comparative value and actual 
comparative value/cost of various household drinking water treatment and safe storage  
options in Ghana.  It will entail a baseline survey of two urban and two rural communities, 
choices of products offered at various prices and users followed over a six-month period. 
This project would be conducted with Pure Home Water staff and potentially with others 
(MIT’s Poverty Action Lab, Sloan G-Lab and/or Harvard Economics Dept). The person 
selecting this project will be the team engineer, responsible for water quality testing of a 
range of product choices, which will include a subset of the following: 
 
Disinfection-Only Options 
•  Aquatabs (household or community scale) 
•  Dagyeis (Arch Chemicals) calcium hypochlorite (community-scale only) 
•  Solar disinfection 
Particle Removal Options 
•  Sedimentation  
•  Alum and/or Natural Polymer Coagulation 
•  Biosand Filter – International Aid Plastic Version 
•  Doulton Candle Filter  
•  Okay Candle Filter 
•  Ceramic Pot Filter (Pure Home Water’s Kosim filter) 
•  Guinea Worm Cloth Filter 
Combined System (Particle Removal + Disinfection) Options 
•  PuR 
•  Bagged water (a.k.a. “sachet water”)  
•  Mission Filter 

 
11. Guinea Worm Cloth Filter Dissemination (G-Lab) 
 
A cloth filter has been disseminated for free to users in Ghana as part of the Guinea 
Worm Eradication Program (GWEP). Using randomized, controlled methods, this project 
will investigate the success of this free dissemination model and compare it to the Pure 
Home Water social enterprise model, in which filters are sold at two different prices, 
depending on whether the customer is from an urban or rural household. Does free 
dissemination undermine long-term sustained use, and if so, does charging a price 
increase a sense of ownership and personal responsibility. It will answer the question – 
which model – free distribution or a social marketing model (or other?)  - will quickly 
and effectively reach millions of people in Ghana and throughout West Africa?
