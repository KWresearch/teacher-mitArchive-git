***** Course Description *****
This class is one of the core requirements for the Environmental Masters of
Engineering program, in conjunction with 1.133 Masters of Engineering Concepts
of Engineering Practice. It is designed to teach about environmental
engineering through the use of case studies, computer software tools, and
seminars from industrial experts. Case studies provide the basis for group
projects as well as individual theses. Recent 1.782 projects include the MMR
Superfund site on Cape Cod, appropriate wastewater treatment technology for
Brazil and Honduras, point-of-use water treatment and safe storage procedures
for Nepal and Ghana, Brownfields Development in Providence, RI, and water
resource planning for the island of Cyprus and refugee settlements in Thailand.
This class spans the entire academic year; students must register for the Fall
and Spring terms.
