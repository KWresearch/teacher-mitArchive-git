***** Course Information *****
The Civil and Environmental Engineering Department's Master of Engineering
(MEng) program differs from most other one-year masters programs in its
requirement of both a group project and an individual thesis linked to the
project. These provide a valuable real-world experience to complement the
extensive coursework students receive.
1.782 is the project subject for students in the Environmental track of the
MEng program. Analogous subjects for the High Performance Structures (HPS)Â and
Information Technology tracks are 1.562 and 1.120, respectively. Students in
the Geotechnical track usually join with students in the HPS or Environmental
tracks for their project.
The project / thesis is a yearlong effort designed to mimic professional
practice. In September, participating faculty and staff present a number of
potential projects and a mock "request for proposal" (RFP) is provided for
each. The goal is to offer sufficient choices that students are able to choose
a project within their specialty. Students respond to the RFP by forming
"companies," or units within companies, usually of 3-5 students each. The
process begins with a written "letter of intent" submitted in early October. In
November teams submit a draft proposal and present it orally to their
companies' "upper management," consisting of project supervisors who critique
the proposed work plan. In December they present their final proposal (in
written and oral forms) to their "client" (a mock government agency or large
engineering firm). These final proposal presentations are tape-recorded and
students are asked to critique their own presentationâand that of a
classmateâas an assignment in their Concepts of Engineering Practice subject
(1.133). During January, when there are few formal classes, students work
intensively on their project, usually visiting their project site. Final oral
presentations are made to the public in April, and students spend their last
month finishing their individual theses, which are developed from the group
project. The final project report, due along with the theses in May, can either
be an integration of the individual theses or a condensed exposition suitable
for publication in a journal or conference proceeding.
Recent 1.782 projects include the MMR Superfund site on Cape Cod, appropriate
wastewater treatment technology for Brazil and Honduras, point-of-use water
treatment and safe storage procedures for Nepal and Ghana, Brownfields
Development in Providence, RI, and water resource planning for the island of
Cyprus and refugee settlements in Thailand.
Representative RFPs, proposal presentations, and final presentations are
presented on this site.
