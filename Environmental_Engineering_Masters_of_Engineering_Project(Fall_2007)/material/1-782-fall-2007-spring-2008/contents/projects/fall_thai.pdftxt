PART I: DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM 
Objectives: 
1.  Collect elevation & additional system data 

|  Handheld GPS units to add data to GIS Map 

A
2.  Create EPANET distribution model

|  Link GIS Map and flow data to EPANET 

A
3.  Calibrate model

|  Salt or rhodamine testing                                                        

a
4.	 Suggest potential improvements 
|	 Pumping energy and cost, impact of new sources, contaminant 
tracing 

INTERMITTENT FLOW 

|  Supply ≠ Demand 
y  Pressure-driven analysis 
y  Network charging; pipes not always full 
|  Variation of flow and roughness coefficient as expels air 
|  Quality concerns 
y  Groundwater ingress and microbial regrowth while stagnant 
y  Pressure/velocity peaks allow for biofilm detachment 
|  Social effects 
y  Take more than necessary: “just in case” & non-metered 
y  Leave collector beneath tap to get every drop

EPANET: PRINCIPLES & COMPONENTS 


|  Principles 
y  Hydraulics - Conservation of mass & energy 
y  Quality - Continuity of flow & reaction kinetics 
|  Components 
y  Nodes, pumps, pipes, reservoirs, tanks 

EPANET: CAPABILITIES


| No size limit 
| Time-varying demand 
| Pressure driven nodes 
| Bulk reactions and pipe-
wall reactions 
Nth order reactions, Michaelis-Menton 
| Head-loss equations and 
mixing tank models 
| Use of ArcGIS data 

EXISTING DATA


| Microsoft Excel file 
| Pipe lengths & diameters 
| ~10 sections broken up by 
feeder tanks 
| No obvious joint 
information 
| Some missing or 

confusing data


PART II: WATER QUALITY 

|Goal: provide higher quality spring-water 
using appropriate treatment processes 

|Existing situation 
y  Known elevated turbidities 
y  Various disconnected storage tanks and 

distribution systems 
y  Chlorination
