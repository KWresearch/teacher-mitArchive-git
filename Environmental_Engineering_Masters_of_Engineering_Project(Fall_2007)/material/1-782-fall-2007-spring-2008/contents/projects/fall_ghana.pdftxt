Description of Survey Instrument 
Designed to define customer groups with distinct behaviors and preferences, 
desired HWTS product features will then be assessed for each segment 

Goal 

Household Profile 

	 Define actionable market segments 
for HWTS products in Northern Ghana 

Conjoint Analysis 
 Understand product feature 
preference 

 Assess differences behavior and 
beliefs cross market segments. 

 Assess variations in ideal HWTS 
product by customer segment 

Research 
Questions 
Addressed 

 Demographics – Gender? Age? Family 
size? Number of children under 5? 

 Purchaser identification - Who makes 
the buying decision? Who influences? 
Where are products bought? 

	 Ability to pay - Profession?  Fuel type? 

 Water treatment, sanitation and health 
practices and beliefs - Source?  
Current treatment system? 
Satisfaction? Amount filtered daily 

	 What features of an HWTS 
product are most important to 
Ghanaian customers? 

 How much would they pay for 
each feature? Existing products? 

	 Which existing product is most 
attractive to customers?  

	 How could existing products be 
improved to be more attractive to 
customers / better meet needs?
