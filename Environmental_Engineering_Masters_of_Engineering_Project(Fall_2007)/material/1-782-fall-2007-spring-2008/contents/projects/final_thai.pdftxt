ERROR ANALYSIS


|  Previous AMI tap stand location data and corresponding 
elevation error from DEM 
| Mostly: 1-2m elevation change per 15m on land 
|  Closer to mountains: 10-15m change per 15m 

HOME DISTANCE TO TAP STAND 
HISTOGRAM 

|  Assumes everyone gets water from closest tap 
|  Nearly 50% of homes within 30-60m range 
|  Some large outliers with distances >200m (many in SP2 
region) 

WATER CONSUMPTION AND TRAVEL 
TIMES 
| Trip travel times less than ~3 mins. Æ increased

WATER CONSUMPTION AND TRAVEL 
TIMES 

| 93% of homes have tap within 115 meters

| Excluding SP2 region, over 95% of homes


WATER VOLUME DISTRIBUTION


|  Recommended minimum water consumption:  7.5 
 
liters/capita/day (WHO) 
|  Assuming 6 people/home Æ 50 liters/home/day 

|  Use EPANET model results which provides flow 
estimation for 88 of 129 viable tap stands 

WATER VOLUME DISTRIBUTION


|  360 homes (7%) under-serviced 
|  6 of 88 tap stands 

TIME TO COLLECT 50 LITERS 


|  Compare to available collection time/home 
|  Based on taps/stand and population density 
|  Under-serviced: 
additional 180 homes 
|  Increase to 10% of homes (from 7% volume)

EXISTING WATER TREATMENT 

| Disinfection by chlorination 
y  Effective chlorination requires low turbidity levels 
y  Treatment goal:  Turbidity ≤ 10 NTU 

| Horizontal-flow roughing filter at Spring 10 

WATER TREATMENT OBJECTIVES 

|  Study effectiveness of existing filter 
y  Improve the filter 

|  Design a general filter for other springs 

|  Determine necessary maintenance
