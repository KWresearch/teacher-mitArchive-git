What is Pragmatics? 

1 

Hypothesis: there is a dedicated cognitive system – a semantic system – that plays a 
central role in an account of the meaning of linguistic expressions (the way they can be 
used in thought and communication). 

Semantics: The study of the semantic system 

Pragmatics: The study of other things that might influence meaning besides the semantic 
system.  

It might be useful to conceptualize things sequentially: 

LF ---- semantic system -----> SEM1---- pragmatics -----> SEM2 

A few examples 

Non-Semantic Inferences (Implicatures) 

Letter of recommendation for a philosophy job: “Dear Sir, Mr. X’s command of English 
is excellent, and his attendance at tutorials has been regular. Yours, Prof. Y, etc.” This 
letter leads to the inference that Mr. X is a pour philosopher (in Prof. Y’s opinion). 
However, we seem to have a clear intuition that this inference does not follow directly 
from the semantic representation.  

Non-linguistic Meaning 

The meaning of many expressions depends on extra-linguistic knowledge. This is most 
obvious when very specific contextual factors can be identified: personal pronouns, 
demonstratives, domain restriction for quantifiers, etc. 

But similar conclusions have been argued for many other expressions: e.g., natural kind 
terms. 

Presuppositions 

Certain expressions are acceptable only if certain contextual pre-conditions are met… 

It is not yet obvious what the role for pragmatics is here. In the first semester intro we 
talk about presuppositions as definedness conditions determined by the semantics. If this 
is true, the question for pragmatics is how to relate definedness conditions to conditions 
on what is taken for granted in a conversation. We will also discuss various theories of 
“presupposition projection” that are directly tied to attempts to relate the two notions.

1. Letter of Recommendation 

Implicatures 

2 

(1)  S(peaker): 
Mr. X’s command of English is excellent, and his attendance at tutorials has been 
regular. 

Addressee: 
a. If S believed that X was a good philosopher, S would have said so.  
Hence, it’s not the case that S believes that X is a good philosopher. 
b. There is reason to believe that S has an opinion with respect to X’s philosophical skills.
 
  Hence, S believes that X is not a good philosopher. 

Addressee*: 
a*. If S believed that X was a bad philosopher, S would have said so.  
Hence, it’s not the case that S believes that X is a bad philosopher. 
Hence (given b), S believes that X is not a bad philosopher. 

Question: What blocks the inference of Addressee*? 

Plausible answer: There is a known convention for letter writing. Write only good things.  


But, why would we draw slightly different conclusions from the following?  


(2)  S(peaker): 
Mr. X is either a bad philosopher or a good philosopher (or a mediocre 
philosopher). 

2. Ignorance Inferences 

(3)  S: John talked to Mary or Sue. 
Ignorance Inferences: 
 
S has no opinion as to whether or not John spoke to Mary. 
S has no opinion as to whether or not John spoke to Sue. 

Addressee: 
a. 	 If S believed that John spoke to Mary, S would have said so.  
Hence, it’s not the case that S believes that John spoke to Mary. 
b. 	 If S believed that John spoke to Sue, S would have said so.  
Hence, it’s not the case that S believes that John spoke to Sue. 
c. 	 If S believed that John didn’t speak to Mary, S would have believed that John spoke 
to Sue (given that S believes the disjunction). But we’ve shown that conclusion to be 
false in b.

d. 	 If S believed that John didn’t speak to Sue, S would have believed that John spoke to 
Mary (given that S believes the disjunction). But we’ve shown that conclusion to be 
false in a.

3.4. The Exhaustivity Generalization 

But this is a bad proposal for three reasons: 

a. 	 It doesn’t capture the full range of scalar implicatures  
b. 	 It makes the wrong predictions for ellipsis (Tamina Stephenson, p.c.) 
c. 	 It misses a generalization 

3.4.1  Lexical Ambiguities are empirically insufficient  

In downward entailing contexts the relevant inferences are reversed: 

(16) 

John didn’t do all of the homework. 

 

 

Implicature: 
John did some of the homework.

a.  John did much of the homework. 
 
Implicature: John didn’t do all of the homework.

John has 2 children. Bill does, too. In fact, Bill has 3 children. 

(20)  A: How many children does John have? 
B: He has 2 children. 
A: That’s interesting none of his friends does.  

(21)  A: How many of the problems did John solve? 
B: He solved 4 of them.  
A: I wonder if Bill did, as well. 
B: Of course Bill did. Bill always solves all of the problems 

3.4.3. The Generalization: 

The phenomenon we are dealing with is pretty general, and multiplying meanings at will 
misses the generalization:

a. It’s warm outside.  (Likely inference: It is not hot outside) 
b. If it’s warm outside, you don’t need to take a sweater. 
(≠If it’s warm but not hot outside, you don’t need to take a sweater). 
a. Mary is as tall as John is.  (Likely inference: Mary is not taller than John is.) 
b. Mary is as tall as John is. 	 For all I know, she might be taller 
(≠Mary is exactly as tall as John is.  For all I know, she might be taller.) 

a. It’s possible that there is a sneak in the box.  
 
 
 
(Likely inference: It’s not necessary…) 
b. You shouldn’t open the box if it’s possible that there is a sneak inside. 

a. John started working on his experiment.  
 
 
 
(Likely inference: he didn’t finish) 
b. If you start working on your experiment, we will all be happy.

The generalization refers to a class of lexical entries (quantifiers, numeral expressions,  

truth conditional operators, comparatives, modal operators…), which are members of 

postulated sets of alternatives, Horn Scales.1


6 

Quantifiers: {Some, Many/Much, Most, Every/All} 

Numerals: {one, two, three,…} 

Truth conditional operators {or, and} 

Comparative operators {as, er}

Various gradable adjectives {warm, hot}, {small, tiny} {big, huge}, etc 

Modal operators {possible, necessary} 

… 


(26) 	 The Exhaustivity Generalization: utterance of a sentence,  S, as a default, licenses 
the inference that (the speaker believes that) all of the scalar alternatives of S that 
are logically stronger than S are false (Henceforth, the Exhaustivity Inference). 
The Scalar Alternatives of a sentence S, Alt(S), are the set of sentences that can 
be derived from S by replacing scalar items in S by their scale-mates. 

(27) 

	Example: 
John bought 4 houses is a Scalar Alternative of John bought 3 houses .  Since 
John bought 4 houses is logically stronger, The Exhaustivity Generalization tells 
us that utterance of John bought 3 houses, as-a-default, licenses the inference that 
(the speaker believes) that John didn’t buy 4 houses.  

Question: Is there a way to state the generalization without reference to arbitrary sets of 
alternatives? We will see an argument in a recent paper by Katzir that there is.  

1 I represent Horn-Scales as unordered sets for reasons discussed in Sauerland (2004). In particular, the 
generalization needs to make reference to an ordering relation among sentences, which makes it 
unnecessary to order the lexical items.

4.  The (neo)-Gricean Account (Horn, Sauerland,…)2 

The Exhaustivity Inferences do not follow from the semantics of sentences but rather 
from pragmatic reasoning about the belief-states of speakers. 

4.1. The short version (which doesn’t really work) 

(28)  	

John bought 3 houses. 

(29) 

	Hearer’s reasoning: 
If John bought 4 houses, that would have been relevant information. s did not 
provide me with this information. It is therefore reasonable to assume that s thinks 
that John did not buy 4 houses. 

4.2. The formal nature of the set of alternatives 

Why not the following: 

(30) 

	*Addressee’s reasoning: 
If John bought exactly 3 houses, that would have been relevant information. S did 
not provide me with this information. It is therefore reasonable to assume that S 
thinks that John did not buy exactly 3 houses. 

After all: John bought 3 houses is equivalent to John bought exactly 3 houses or more 
than 3 houses. 

If the exhaustivity inference is to follow from reasoning about the alternative utterances 
that the speaker avoided, something needs to be said in order to insure that we have the 
right set of alternatives. 

(31)a.  John bought 4 houses ∈ {S: Addressee considers S as a possible alternatives when hearing (28)} 
b.  John bought exactly 3 houses ∉ {S: Addressee considers S as a pos. alt. when hearing (28)} 

(32)	

(33) 	

 Standard Maxim of quantity: If S1 S2 are both relevant to the topic of 
conversation and S1 is more informative than S2 the speaker should utter S1 rather 
than S2. 

 Neo-Gricean Maxim of quantity: If S1 S2 are both relevant to the topic of 
conversation and S1 is More informative than S2  and S1∈Alt(S2) the speaker 
should utter S1 rather than S2. 

2 The presentation in this subsection is based on class notes of Kai von Fintel and Irene Heim. 

24.954, Spring 2010

(34) 	 Alt(S) =  
{S': S' can be derived from S by successive replacement of lexical items with their 
lexically specified alternatives.}  

8 

(35) 	 Alt(four) = {one, two, three, four, five,… }  
Alt(some) = {some, (many), all}  
 
 
Alt(or) = {or, and} … 

4.3. As it stands the hearer is only justified in making a weaker inference  
(Soames 1982:455-456; Groenendijk and Stokhof 1984) 

(29) 

	Addressee’s reasoning: 
If John bought 4 houses, that would have been relevant information. S did not 
provide me with this information. It is therefore reasonable to assume that S 
thinks that John did not buy 4 houses. 

Wait a second. That was a little hasty. All I can conclude at the moment is that S 
is not in a position to claim that John bought 4 houses. The reason for this could 
be that S thinks that John didn’t buy 4 houses. But it could just as well be the case 
that S doesn’t know whether or not John bought 4 houses. 

Necessary assumption (opinionated speaker): When S is uttered by a speaker, s, the 
hearer’s default assumption is that for every member of Alt(S), s has an opinion as to 
whether or not S is true. 

It is sometimes suggested that we get implicatures only when it is presupposed that the 
speaker is opinionated. Not obvious that this is true. 

(29)  	

John collected 50 leaves in this bag. 

4.4. The long version (which does work) 

Hearer’s assumptions: 

1.	 NG Maxim of Quantity (NG-MQ): speakers know that they have to make the most 
informative relevant contribution to a conversation given a formally defined set of 
alternatives.   
2.	 Alternative Set: the relevant set of alternatives is constructed with reference to Horn 
Scales; it is Alt(S). 
3.	 Opinionated Speaker (OS): (as a default) speakers are assumed to have an opinion 
regarding the truth-value of members of Alt (S). 

(36) 	 Context: A speaker s utters the sentence, John bought 3 houses. 

1. 	 Given NG-MQ, we can infer that it’s not the case that s thinks about one of 
the stronger alternatives in the designated set that it is true. 

9 

24.954, Spring 2010 
Danny Fox 
2. 	 The set of alternatives contains  John bought 4 houses, which is logically 
stronger than the speaker’s utterance. Hence given 1 it’s not the case that 
speaker thinks that this sentence is true.  
3. 	 Given OS the default assumption is that the speaker has an opinion as to 
whether John bought 4 houses is true or false. Given 2 (the conclusion that it’s 
not the case that the speaker thinks that the sentences is true), we can conclude 
that the speaker thinks that it is false.  
So we do not derive the conclusion that S is false, but only the conclusion that the 
speaker thinks S is false. This might be good enough. If a speaker utters a sentence and 
by that conveys her belief that a certain proposition, p, holds, it is natural that we will 
accept p whenever we accept the speakers utterance, and that p will seem to be an 
inference of the sentence. (However, much of the philosophical literature tries to derive 
something stronger, something like “mutual knowledge” of the speaker’s belief that the 
stronger alternatives in Alt (S) are false.) 
4. 5. What is the derived generalization? 

Does this really derive the Exhaustivity Generalization? 

Not quite, instead: 

(37) 	 The Pragmatic Exhaustivity Generalization: utterance of a sentence,  S, as a 
default, licenses the inference that (the speaker believes that) all of the scalar 
alternatives of S that are pragmatically/contextually stronger than S are false  

To understand the type of fact that might distinguish between the two generalizations, 
consider the following: 

(38) 	

John has an even number of kids. He has three kids. 

The second sentence of (38), arguably, should not have an exactly 3 implicature. Once 
the first sentence is accepted, the second sentence is not contextually stronger than the 
alternative which is supposedly responsible for the implicature. For further discussion, 
see the papers on implicatures and encapsulation (on the website). 

Homework: What implicatures is the second sentence of (38) predicted to have by the 
Neo-Gricean account we’ve outlined? 

So (38) appears to argue in favor of the Exhaustivity Generalization in (26) and against 
the Pragmatic Exhaustivity Generalization in (37). The following is sometimes taken to 
argue for the opposite conclusion: 

(39) 	 Did you mail the letter? 
 
 
I typed it. 
Implicature: I didn’t mail the letter.

Standard terminology: 
“Implicatures”: inferences from sentences based on reasoning about speakers beliefs. 
“Scalar Implicatures”: Implicatures that rely on the Maxim of Quantity, Horn-
Alternatives, and the assumption of an Opinionated-Speaker. 

We will use the term “Scalar Implicatures” extensionally to refer to the type of 
“problematic inferences” we’ve looked at, even when we will consider grammatical 
theories under which these inferences are not the result of reasoning about speakers 
beliefs.
