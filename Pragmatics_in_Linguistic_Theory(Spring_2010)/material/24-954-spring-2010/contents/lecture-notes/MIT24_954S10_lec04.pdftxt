Economy and Embedded Exhaustification  

Danny Fox and Benjamin Spector  


Background: Putative cracks in the Neo-Gricean Framework (mostly reviewed in 
Cheirchia, Fox and Spector, in press; henceforth, CFS) 

1.	 Obligatory implicatures (Cheirchia, Magri) 
2.	 NPI licensing: Intervention effects in NPI licensing (Cheirchia, Gajewski, 
Homer) 
3.	 Modularity: Evidence that implicatures are computed by a modular system 
encapsulated from various propositions we know to be true (Fox, Fox and 
Hackl, Magri, Singh) 
4.	 Cummulativity: Implicatures of sentences in which numerals receive 
cumulative interpretations (Landman) 
5.	 Free Choice Phenomena (Chemla, Fox, Klinedinst) 

6.	 Embedded Implicatures (Chierchia, Cohen, Landman, Levinson, passim) 

Question: Are there embedded implicatures? 
As we will see: there is conflicting evidence. 

Proposal: 

A. 	 There are embedded implicatures. implicatures are derived by an operator exh, 
which, in principle, can be applied in any scope position (CFS, Fox, Landman, Sevi, 
and others). Hence, there have to be embedded implicatures.  

Given this account, we will use a more transparent term, namely Embedded 
Exhaustification, EE. 

B. 	 Economy: EE is not always visible due to the effects of an economy condition which 
restricts application of exh. 

Problem #1: The Relevance of Focus 

Evidence in favor of embedded implicatures: 

(1)  John didn’t do the reading OR the homework. He did both. 

Evidence against embedded implicatures: 

(2)  #John didn’t do the reading or the homework. He did both. 

2 

More specifically, 

a. If there are embedded implicatures, why is (2) bad  

(a question raised most forcefully by Horn 1989)?  

b. If there are no embedded implicatures, why is (1) good? 

(a question raised by many: Cohen, Kempson, Levinson, passim)


The Implicature Focus Generalizations: implicatures can be embedded under a 
downward entailing (DE) operator only if the (relevant) scalar terms bear pitch accent.1 

Problem #2: Gajewski and Sharvit’s Problem: 

(3)  a.  John talked to Mary or Sue, or both. 
b. 	 *John didn’t talk to Mary or Sue, or both 

We will see that the acceptability of (3)a requires EE. But then why is (3)b bad? 

Problem #3: Singh’s Problem: 

(4)  a.  John talked to Mary or Sue, or to both Mary and Sue. 
b. 	 *John taked to both Mary and Sue or to Mary or Sue 

Similarly, why is (4)b bad? 

Structure: 

1.	 Explain the nature of the arguments in CFS for EE based on sentences such as 
(3)(=(4)). 
2.	 Present a simplified version of the Economy condition that deals with Singh’s 
observations (problem #3) and makes additional predictions. 
3.	 Extend the condition to disallow EE in DE contexts, thus accounting for G&S’s 
problem (Problem #2), with an additional prediction. 
4. 	 Discuss certain assumptions about the nature of scalar alternatives and their 
relationship to focus that will allow us to further extend the proposal to a solution 
of Problem #1. 

1. HC and EE (background) 

(5)  a.  #John was born in France or Paris. 
b. 	 #I have a dog or a German Shepard. 

1 The following alternative Generalization is sometimes presupposed, but argued against in CFS: 
An alternative (false) Implicature Focus Generalizations: implicatures can be 
embedded only if the (relevant) scalar terms bear pitch accent. 

3 

Hurford’s constraint (HC): a disjunction p or q is unacceptable when one of the 
disjuncts entails the other.2 

(6) 

But 

(7)a. 
John talked to [Mary or Sue] or both.(Hurford 1974) 
b.  John did some or all of the homework. 
c.  John read 3 books or more. 
(Gazdar 1979) 

Our Claim: 

(8)  	

(7)'	

EE is the culprit: The sentences in (7) must receive the parse in (7)', which does 
not violate HC. 

a.  [Exh(p ∨q)] ∨ (p ∧q) 
b.  [Exh(Some)] ∨ (ALL) 
c.  [Exh(Three)] ∨ (more than 3) 

Where 
Exh(p ∨q) ≡ (p ∨q)] ∧¬ (p ∧q) 
Exh(Some) ≡ Some ∧¬ ALL
Exh(Three) ≡ Three ∧¬ More than three 

 
 

If we are right, these are cases where implicatures are computed locally (i.e. cases of EE) 
without any pitch accent on the relevant scalar item. 

Evidence that we are right: cases where the form of EE needed to obviate HC has global 
consequences for meaning and we argue that these consequences are correct (see CFS for 
details). 

2.  Basic Strategy for Singh and G&S 

(9)  Singh’s Asymmetry 
a.  John either talked to Mary or Sue or to both (Mary and Sue). 
b. 	 *John either talked to both Mary and Sue or to Mary or Sue. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Singh 2007) 

 

 

(10) 	 Gajewski & Sharvit’s restriction 
*John didn’t talk to Mary or Sue or to both. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

(Gajewski and Sharvit 2007) 

Basic Idea: Exh cannot appear in the position required for (9)b and (10) to obviate HC. 

2 See Singh 2008, for arguments that the constraint should be strengthened, arguments, which as Singh 
mentions, do not bear on our conclusions. 

4 

(11)  Ruled out by Economy 
a. 	 (p and q) or Exh(p or q) 
b. 
¬[Exh(p or q) or (p & q)] 

(12)  Ruled out by HC 
a. 	 (p and q) or (p or q) 
b. 
¬[(p or q) or (p & q)] 

3. An Economy Condition on Exh insertion (first version) 

(13) 	 Economy Condition: *S(Exh(A)), if Exh is incrementally vacuous in S. 
(In a sense very close to that of Schlenker 2008) 

(14) 	

a.  An occurrence of Exh is globally vacuous in a sentence S if eliminating it 
doesn’t change truth conditions, i.e., if S(Exh(A)) is equivalent to S(A) 

b. 

Exh which takes A as argument is incrementally vacuous in a sentence S if 
Exh is globally vacuous for every continuation of S at point A. 

c. 	 S' is a continuation of S in point A if S' can be derived from S by replacement 
of constituents that follow A. 

d. 	 Y follows A if all the terminals of Y are pronounced after all the terminals of 
A. 

4. The Singh Asymmetry 

(15) 	

The Hurford Case: 
a1.  [Exh(p or q)] or (p and q)    √Economy: Exh is not incrementally vacuous 
a2.  * (p or q) or (p and q) 
*Hurford’s constraint

 

 

 

The Singh Case: 
b1. *(p and q) or exh[(p or q)] 
b2. *(p and q)] or (p or q) 

*Economy: Exh is incrementally vacuous 
*Hurford’s constraint 

4.1. On the reality of the effect (from Google) 

(16) 

a.  	 “some or many” 206,000 vs. “many or some” 11,400 
b. 	 “many or all”  573,000 vs. “all or many” 112,000 

So there is a clear asymmetry in Singh’s direction, but it doesn’t seem to be absolute. We 
want to argue: the numbers are to be accounted for by an absolute constraint (Economy) 
which is obviated in certain environments.   

In particular… 
(17) 
“some or all” 494,000 vs. “all or some” 457,000 

	
	
	
5 

We hope to be able to make some sense of these numbers, once we examine some further 
predictions of our proposal 

4.2. Further Predictions 

The basic logic:  
•	 Singh’s asymmetry shows up because exh is globally vacuous in standard Hurford 
disjunctions. 
•	 For this reason, there is an asymmetry between the first and the second disjunct: 
exh on the first disjunct is globally vacuous but not incrementally vacuous, 
whereas exh on the second disjunct is incrementally vacuous. (On a final 
constituent global and incremental vacuity are equivalent). 
•	 But this is not a necessary property of entailing disjunct, as we will see.  
•	 There are cases where one disjunct entails another yet exhaustifiying one is not 
globally vacuous. In such cases, it will not be incrementally vacuous on either of 
the disjuncts (because global non-vacuity entails incremental non-vacuity). 
Singh’s asymmetry should thus not hold. 

We can thus construct cases where Exh is not incrementally vacuous even when it 
appears in a second disjunct and needed to obviate Hurford’s constraint. We predict that 
such cases would be acceptable (in contrast to Singh, who designed a system where the 
asymmetry is a primitive). 

4.2.1. Distant Entailing Disjunctions (DEDs) 

(18) 	

Ingredients: 
Take two sentences p and q, such that: 
	q entails p 
a. 
b. 	 this entailment can be obviated by exhaustification: there is a way to 
strengthen p by Exh, S(p), such that p doesn’t entail S(p)
	q or S(p) is stronger than (q or p). 

c. 

 

Strengthening of p by exh will be licensed by Economy (since it is not vacuous), q or p 
will receive the parse q or S(p), which will not violate HC: 

ALL or Some 

(19)  	

Did John do most of the homework? 
No. He did all of it or some of it. 

Free Choice Effect in the second disjunct 

(20) 	

a.  *John (either) did both the reading and the homework or the reading or the 
homework. 

6 

b.	 We are either required to do both the reading and the homework or we’re 
required to do the reading or the homework. 

Not (incrementally) vacuous because of the free choice effect: 

Exh (cid:0)(p ∨ q) ⇔ (cid:0)(p ∨ q) ∧¬(cid:0)p  ∧¬(cid:0)q 
⇒ ◊q ∧ ◊p 
Hence stronger than (cid:0)(p ∨ q) & ¬(cid:0)(p∧q) 
(See: Fox, Sauerland, Spector, among others) 

Exh in an embedded position within the second disjunct 

(21) 	 Either every student solved all of the problems, or every student solved most of 
the problems 

Predicted to be fine, but only under the (a) parse for the second disjunct, in which 
exh is embedded under ∀: 

a. 	 “…or  every student solved exh(most) of the problems” 
(entails uniformity among the students: either they all solved all of the 
problems, or none of them did) 
Under this parse, Exh is not globally weakening, since it leads to the exclusion 
of situations in which some students solved all of the problems while others 
solved most but not all. 

b. * … or exh(every student solved most of the problems) 
Exh is globally vacuous, hence locally vacuous because it occurs on the 
second disjunct 

By contrast, reversing the disjunct should not necessarily carry the same entailment 
(since incremental non-vacuity is ensured on the first disjunct): 

(22) 	 Either every student solved most of the problems, or every student solved all of 
them 

In this case, the following parse should be ok: 

exh(every student solved most of the problems) or every student solved all of thm 


This is so because exh is not incrementally vacuous (though it is globally 

vacuous) 


In other words, we predict (22), in contrast to (21), to be ambiguous. 

7 

4.2.2. Embedding under Matrix exh 

Making use of Free Choice 

(23) 	 We are required to do all or some of the homework 

This is predicted to be good under the parse: Exh((cid:0) (all) or Exh(some))  

Under this parse, none of the instances of exh are globally vacuous. (Eliminate any 

instance of exh and you loose the Free Choice entailment ¬(cid:0)[Exh(some)].) 


Similar Fact with Universal Quantifiers: 

(24) 

 

 

a.  *The student solved all or most of the problems. 
b.  Each student solved all or most of the problems 
 
Exh(∀x (ALL…x…) or Exh(Most…x…)) 

Possibly relevant examples from Google: 

(25) 	 A new Harris Poll finds a plurality of Americans want all or most abortions to be 
illegal 

(26) 

 

	What are all or some of the differences and similarities between Roman 
Architecture and Egyptian Architecture? 
Similar to: Tell me all or some of the differences and similarities between Roman 
Architecture and Egyptian Architecture 

5. 	

Gajewski and Sharvit and version 2 of the Economy Condition 

(27) 

¬[Exh(p or q) or both] 

Problem: Exh is not (incrementally) vacuous, although it is globally vacuous. 

Proposal: exh cannot be incrementally weakening (a sentence with exh cannot be 
entailed (incrementally) by a sentence without exh). 

Possible precedents: various strongest meaning hypotheses (work on reciprocals and 
plurality Dalrymple et. al., Winter, etc., Chierchia on implicatures) 

Possible Functional Motivation (Fox 2007): The role of exh is to eliminate unwanted 
ignorance inferences derived by Gricean reasoning. If exh is weakening, it 
cannot eliminate ignorance inferences. 

(28) 	 Economy Condition: *S(Exh(A)), if Exh is incrementally weakening in S. 

(29) 	

a.  An occurrence of Exh is globally weakening in a sentence S if eliminating it 
strengthens truth conditions, i.e., if S(A) entails S(Exh(A)). 

	
8

 (*special case when S is equivalent to S(Exh(A)); i.e. when exh is 
vacuous*) 

b. 

	Exh which takes A as argument is incrementally weakening in a sentence S if 
Exh is globally weakening for every continuation of S at point A. 

c-d as before 

This modification does not affect the results of the previous section, since in 
that section all of the cases of non-vacuity involved strengthening (hence, of 
course, non-weakening).. 

Further Prediction: We can construct cases where Exh is not incrementally weakening 
even when it appears in the scope of a DE operator. 

(30) 

a. 
b. 

*John didn’t hand in the first or second assignment or both. 
Everyone who didn’t hand in the first or second assignment or both failed the 
class. 

(31) 

a. 
b. 

*I would go to the movies without John or Bill or both. 
I wouldn’t go to the movies without John or Bill or both. 

But we will have additional predictions... 

6. 	 Towards a solution of Problem #1: deriving The Implicature Focus Generalizations, 
basic ingredients 

Our solution to Problem #1 will contain two independent ingredients: 

a. 	 An observation that embedding exh below a DE operator need not be weakening 
if there is another exh above the DE operator, as in: Exh(¬Exh(p or q)) 

b. 	 A generalized version of the economy condition which compares possible domain 
restrictions for exh (and is needed on independent grounds). 
As such, the generalized condition can rule out certain patters of focus marking, 
because focus marking, we will claim, is directly correlated with choice of 
alternatives. 

We will start with (b) 

9 

7. Economy as a condition on the domain of exh 

7.1. Santorio’s problem 

Santorio (2008) presents the following challenge to our account of Singh’s asymmetry. 

(32) 	

a.  Some or many of the students were in the room. 
b. 	 ?? Many or some of the students were in the room. 

Why isn’t (32)b good under the parse in  (32)'? 

(32)'	  Exh(Many) or Exh(Some) 
Many and not all 
or Some but not many 

After all: 

a.	 Both occurrences of exh are globally strengthening (hence, of course, 
incrementally strengthening). [If either occurrence of exh were dropped, the 
sentence would be true if all the students were in the room.]  
(32)' does not violate HC. [The two disjuncts are incompatible.]  

b.	

7.2. Comparison Class for Economy – The basic intuition 

Our Economy condition looks at a constituent exh(ϕ) in a given syntactic context and 
checks how it fares relative to its competitor ϕ. (It shouldn’t yield a weaker meaning) 

We would like to maintain our proposal but to add additional competitors. Santorio’s case 
is problematic because Exh[Some], (= some but not many) does yield a stronger meaning 
than what we get from its competitor without exh, as we’ve seen. However, it does not 
yield a stronger meaning from what we get from another potential competitor, some but 
not all. 

(33) 	 Previous Competition: exhmany(some) [= some but not many] competes with 
some 
New Competition: some but not many competes not only with some but also with 
some but not all 

(34) 

	a.  Previous Intuition: exhaustification is vacuous if it doesn’t yield something 
stronger than what we would get without exhaustification. 
New Intuition: exhaustification is vacuous if it doesn’t yield something 
stronger than what we would get with less exhaustification. 

b. 

The proposal up to now was that exhmany(some) is blocked if the weaker competitor some 
yields a result which is globally just as strong. In such a case we said that exh is 
weakening relative to this competitor. 

	
10 

Now we will say that that exhmany(some) is blocked if one of the weaker competitors 
exhall(some) or some yields a result which is globally just as strong. In such a case we can 
say that exh is weakening relative to one of these competitors. 

In other words, in Santorio’s example the exahaustified meaning of the second disjunct 
needed to obviate HC, some but not many, is blocked by the weaker competitor: some but 
not all. If the second disjunct were to receive the meaning of this weaker competitor 
(some but not all) the meaning of the matrix sentence would be the same.  

7.3. The Actual Proposal 

Let C bet a set of sentences. And let ExhC(X) be the exhaustified LF of X where C is the 
domain restrictor for Exh. 

(35) 

	Meaning ExhC(X) is true iff X is true and all members of C not entailed by X are 
false.3 

(36)  Comparison-Class (ExhC(X)) = {ExhC'(X): C' ⊂ C}  


A sentence equivalent to S is always in the Comparison-Class: S ⇔ Exh∅(S) 


If C' is a proper subset of C, ExhC(X) will entail ExhC'(X) 


The Economy condition will not allow the use of the stronger sentence ExhC(S) if it leads 

to (incremental) weakening relative to ExhC'(X). 

(37) 	 Economy Condition: *S(ExhC(A)), if ExhC is incrementally weakening in S. 

(38) 	

a.  An occurrence of ExhC  is globally weakening in a sentence S if choosing a 
proper subset of C strengthens truth conditions, i.e., if there is a proper subset 
of C, C', such that S(ExhC'(A)) entails S(ExhC(A) 

b-d as before 

Easy to see that if ExhC  is (incrementally) weakening by (13), then it is also 
(incrementally) weakening by (38). [Just let the empty set be C'.] 

3  There are various reasons to modify (35), which, we think, can be made consistent with the eventual 
proposal. What is needed is to define the comparison class as follows: 
(i) 
Comparison-Class (ExhC(X)) = {ExhC'(X): I-E(C',p) ⊂ I-E(C,p)} 
See Fox 2007. 

11 

7.4. Solving Santorio’s problem 

(32)''  a.  *Exh{all}(Many) or Exh{many, all}(Some) 
b.  *Exh{all}(Many) or Exh{all}(Some) 

Economy 
Hurford’s Constraint 

7.5. Complication 

(32)''  Exh{all}(Many) or Exh{many}(Some) 

 

Claim: This is plausibly ruled out by an independently needed condition on domain 
restriction. The domain restriction, C, must be a contextually salient sub-set of the 
formally defined alternatives (which we will specify shortly). The fact that all is a 
member of the set for the first instance of exh tells us that it is contextually 
salient. Hence it should be a member of the alternatives for the second exh. 

8. Exh in DE contexts 

How can exh in a DE context satisfy Economy? 

(39) 

a.  John didn’t talk to Mary OR Sue. He talked to both. 
b. 	 Every boy who did the reading OR the homework got an A. 

Every boy who did both got an A+. 


8.1. Answer a-la Horn 

Exh cannot be inserted in a DE context! 

Things appear otherwise because of various meta-linguistic strategies that are associated 
with pitch accent. 

This will be a boring answer to Problem#1 consistent with our proposal for Problem#2 
and Problem#3. 

But we think we should try to do better. In particular, what are these meta-linguistic 
strategies? Originally, Horn suggested meta-linguistic negation, but examples such as 
(39)b should convince us that there is a more general operator. But, then we’re back to 
the original dilemma. Why can the operator be freely inserted in various embedded 
positions (as we learn from Huford’s constraint), and why is its insertion in DE contexts 
associated with specific focus marking? 

8.2. Sketch of our proposal 

8.2.1 The presence of a higher exh 

Exh can be inserted in a DE context, only if there is another exh outside the DE context. 

12 

(40) 

ExhC1 [¬[ExhC2(p or q)]  


An example that is licensed by the Economy condition:


C1 = {¬(p or q)}  

C2 = {(p and q)} 

(41) 

Exh{¬(p or q)} (¬[Exh{p and q) (p or q)] )= 
¬[Exh{p and q}(p or q)] & ¬¬ (p or q) = 

 

 

p or q and ¬[(p excl-or q)], i.e., p and q. 

Evidence that Exh [¬[Exh(p or q)] = p & q 

(42)  Each of our students studies both of these fields or none of them.  
a. 	 John is no exception. He doesn’t study phonology OR morphology: he studies 
both. 
b.  	 (#)John is no exception. He doesn’t study phonology OR morphology: he 
either studies both or none. 

(43)  None of our students studies phonology OR morphology. 
Every one studies either both of these fields or none of them.  

(to be understood shortly) 


8.2.2. The connection with pitch accent 

We will see that ExhC2 is incrementally weakening if C2 has additional members besides 
p and q. So if p and q is a member of C2, it must be the only member.  

But then an independently needed condition on focusing (namely Minimize Focus, 
Schwarzschild 1999) will require narrow focus on or, thus solving #1. 

	
13 

9. The proposal 

9.1. The relevance of pitch accent 

Pitch accent enters into the determination of alternatives.  

If a scalar item is focused, we get the appropriate alternatives for exhaustification: 

(44) 

	ExhALT[CP John talked to Mary ORF Sue] 
ALT is determined by the focus value of the prejacent CP, which includes  
John talked to Mary and Sue. 

So why is pitch accent not required on or? 

Answer: there can also be broader focus with the default pronunciation, e.g.: 

(45) 

	ExhALT[CP John talked to [Mary or SUE]F] 
ALT is determined by the focus value of the prejacent CP, which includes  
John talked to Mary and Sue, as well as some other alternatives, for example: 
John talked to Dick. 

If we have broad focus, there will be at least one alternative which is not generated by 
narrow focus. This is fairly standard for the theory of focus sensitivity, and we will 
assume that it follows from the combination of following two principles: 

(46) 

 

b. 

	a.  Association with Focus (AF): The set of alternatives for a focus sensitive 
operator must be a subset of the focus value of the prejacent.
	Minimize Focus (MF): A sentence can’t have a focus value F, if it would 
satisfy AF with another focus value F' (derivable by a different distribution of 
focus marking), and F' ⊂ F. 

Consequences: 
a. 	 AF allows M&S to be a member of ALT in both (44) and (45).  
b. 	 But if M&S ∈ALT[(45)], there must, by MF, be at least one member of ALT 
distinct from M&S (let’s say D), else the sentence would be licensed with the 
focus value of (44). 
c. 	 Consequently, if (45) yields the “not and” inference, it must yield an 
additional exclusive inference that would make it stronger than (44), e.g. ¬ D. 

(47) 	 More Generally: Let Snarrow be a sentence that contains one scalar item with 
narrow focus on the scalar item, and let not S1  be its SI. Let Sbroad be identical to 
Snarrow with the sole exception that focus is on a constituent that properly 
dominates the scalar item.  

a. 	 AF allows Sbroad to have not S1 as an SI. 
b. 	 But then it must have an extra SI, call it not S2 

14 

9.2. A key assumption (based on Katzir 2008, Fox and Katzir in press) 

In the parse in (48), the relevant alternative for the matrix exh is the prejacent without 
exhaustification, i.e.,  not (S) 

(48) 

	Exh  [not exh (S)] 
Relevant alternative for Matrix Exh: not(S) 

Generalized to all (DE) operators 

(49) 

	Exh  [OP exh (S)] 
Relevant alternative for Matrix Exh: OP(S) 

9.3. Consequences for a non-DE context 

(50) 

	ExhC [John talked to [Mary or Sue]F] 

Phonlogy: pitch accent on Sue 
Focus value: 
{John talked to Mary or Sue, John talked to Mary, John talked to Sue, John 
talked to Mary and Sue, John talked to Fred…} 

(51) 

	ExhC [John talked to Mary orF Sue] 

Phonlogy: pitch accent on or 

Focus value: 

{John talked to Mary or Sue, John talked Mary and Sue} 


C= any salient sub-set of the focus value that satisfies Minimize Focus. 

So, by MF, one cannot select C = {John talked Mary and Sue} with pitch accent on Sue. 

But both representations can yield the exclusive or inference, hence no expectation that 
narrow focus will be needed in upward monotone contexts. 

9.4. Consequences for a DE context 

9.4.1. Negation 

(52) 	

Exh{¬(p or q)} (¬[Exh{p and q) (p orF q)]F )= 
¬[Exh{p and q}(p or q)] & ¬¬ (p or q) = p & q 

Neither exh is (incrementally) weakening 

15 

(53) 

a. 
b. 

*Exh{¬(p or q)} (¬[Exh{p and q) (p or q) F]F ) 
*Exh{¬(p or q)} (¬[Exh{p and q, d) (p or q) F]F ) 

violates minimize focus 
The lower exh is incrementally weakening 

Exh{¬(p or q)} (¬[Exh{p and q, d} (p or q)] ) = 
¬[Exh{p and q, r} (p or q)] & ¬¬ (p or q) = 
 
 
 
 
 
 

p or q and 
either (p and q) or r. 

9.4.2.  Generalizing to other DE operators 

(54) 

Exh{OP(p or q)} (OP[Exh{p and q) (p orF q)]F )= 
 
 
OP[Exh{p and q}(p or q)] & ¬OP (p or q) 
Neither exh is weakening. 

Explanation: For each exh showing that it is not weakening involves comparision with 
the representation without exh (the empty set as restrictor). The proof is trivial 

It’s also easy to see that if the lower exh would have the extra-alternative needed for 
broad-focus the result would be weaker. 

10. A new theory of alternatives 

Based on Fox and Katzir (in press). Some other time…

	Exh{¬(p or q)}[¬[Exh {p and q} (p or q) or both]] 

Here Matrix exh is (incrementally) weakening. (Note: embedded exh is globally 

weakening but not incrementally weakening.) 


Two DED disjuncts. 


(56) 	 We did not invite the first year students or all of the students. We invited 
the first year students and the second year students. 

If [S (P) or Q] is stronger than [P or Q], then ¬(P or Q) is stronger than ¬[S (P) or Q]. 

We thus get: 

(57) 

	Exh{¬(P or Q)}[¬[S (P) or Q]]   =  ¬[S (P) or Q] & [P or Q] 

(58) 	 We did not introduce every boy to Mary or Sue or every boy to Mary and Sue. 
We introduced every boy to Mary. 

(59) 	 We did not introduce every boy to Mary or Sue or every boy to Mary and Sue. 
We introduced some boys to Mary or Sue and some boys to Mary and Sue.

12. Summary: 

Hurford Disjunctions provide important evidence for the existence of EE. 

We thus need to understand why EE is restricted, in particular why it cannot occur in DE 
contexts without special pitch accent (problem 1). 

The distribution of Hurford disjunctions is a good probe for studying an independently 
needed constraints on EE (problems 2 and 3). Our hope was that the solutions to these 
problem will resolve problem 1 as well.  

Problems 2 and 3 motivated an economy condition that ruled-out incremental weakening. 
We tried to argue that a particular version of this condition which compared alternative 
domain restrictions extended to problem 1 as well.
