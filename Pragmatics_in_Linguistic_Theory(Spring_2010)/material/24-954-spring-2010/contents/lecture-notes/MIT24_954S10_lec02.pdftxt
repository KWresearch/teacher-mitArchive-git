Hurford Disjunctions 
(based on work in progress by Cheirchia, Fox and Spector, as well as Fox and Spector) 

(1) 	

a.  John talked  to [Mary or Sue] or both. 
b. 	 John did some or all of the homework. 
c. 	 John read 3 books or more. 

With the aid of exh we can keep to a simple definition of Hurford’s constraint. 

(2)  	 Hurford’s constraint (HC): a disjunction p or q is unacceptable when one of the 
disjuncts entails the other. 

Are there any new predictions? 

If HC is right, (3)a should be rejected in favor of the parse in (3)b 

(3) 	

a.  [p or q] or [p and q] 
b.	 exh[p or q] or [p and q] 

The problem is that the two parses are logically equivalent, so how can we distinguish 
between them. 

Two methods: 
a.	 Although here the two parses are equivalent. Can we construct cases where the 
two parses are not equivalent? 
b. 	 Although the two parses are equivalent they have different alternatives, which 
could have consequences for implicatures. Can we investigate those? 

1.  	 New meanings predicted by HC 

a. 	 q entails [p…], 
b. 	 this entailment can be obviated by exhaustification: there is a way to strengthen p by 
Exh, S(p), such that p doesn’t entail S(p) 
c.  (p or q) is not equivalent to S(p) or q  where S(p) is the relevant strengthening of p 

For such cases, (2)  makes new predictions which appear to be corroborated: 
 

(4)  a. 	 John has 3 or 6 children. 
b. 	 Either every boy did some of the homework or Joey did all of the homework and 
every other boy did just some of it. 

2. New Implicatures predicted by HC: 

(5) 	

a.  John did some of the homework. 
b. 	 John did some or all of the homework.
