(1) The S-Exhaustivity Generalization (predicted by Sauerland’s Theory): utterance of a 
sentence,  S, as a default, licenses the inference that (the speaker believes that) every 
sentence is false if it is Sauerland-Excludable given S and Alt(S). 
p is Sauerland-Excludable given S and C if p∈C, p is stronger than S and 

¬∃q∈C [(q is stronger than S) and  (S∧¬p entails q)]. 


Homework: 

Prove that the Sauerland-Exhaustivity Generalization is indeed predicted by Sauerland’s 
theory. 

Solution to question 1: 

Let p be Sauerland-Excludable given S and Alt(S). We need to prove that  

Bs(S) ∧ IPI ∧ Bs(¬p) is not contradictory 
Assume otherwise: 
 
 
 

(a) Bs(S) ∧ IPI ∧ Bs(¬p) is contradictory. 
We conclude: 

(and try to derive a contradiction) 

(b) Bs(S) ∧ Bs(¬p) entails ¬IPI 
(c) Bs(S) ∧ Bs(¬p) entails U¬PI 
(d) Bs(S) ∧ Bs(¬p) entails U{Bs(q): q∈Alt(S) and q stronger than s}

Let w0 be a world in which s believes nothing but S and ¬p (and their logical consequences). 


(De Morgan) 

(e) w0 satisfies U{Bs(q): q∈Alt(S) and q stronger than s}.  (given the entailment in (d))

For a world to satisfy a disjunction, it must satisfy one of the disjuncts.  


So  


(f) there must be a qi ∈Alt(S), stronger than s such that q' is a logical consequence of S and ¬p. 


Hence, 


(g) p is not Sauerland-Excludable. 

(cid:0) 

Note: it is easier to prove the other direction, i.e. ∀p∈ALT(S)(Bs(¬p) is a Secondary Implicature 
of S by Sauerland’s algorithm → p is Sauerland Excludable given S and ALT(S)).
