***** Squib *****
Enrolled students are required to write a squib due at the end of the semester.
In the unmarked case, the squib consists of critical discussion of an article
(or a group of related articles) which is relevant to the topics covered in
this class. It should include:
    * a clear and self-contained presentation of the main claims and arguments
      in the article(s)
    * an explanation of why and how they bear on issues discussed in class
    * problems, possible amendments, or further extensions and applications
Students are strongly encouraged to make appointments to talk about their
thoughts throughout the semester (not just when squibs are due). A short squib
proposal is due one month before the end of term, and the squib itself is due
on the last class.
