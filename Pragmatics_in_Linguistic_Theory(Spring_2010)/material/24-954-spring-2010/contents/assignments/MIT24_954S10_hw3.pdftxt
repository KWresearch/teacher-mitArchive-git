Homework for spring break: 

1.  Consider the sentence in (1). 

(1)  John is required to do the reading or the homework 

a.	

In class we computed the implicatures of this sentence in Sauerland’s system under the 
assumption that disjunction has the Sauerland alternatives as its Horn‐Set, and no other phrase 
in the sentence is a member of a Horn‐Set. Redo this computation both in Sauerland’s system 
and using the exhaustivity operator from Fox (2007). 

b.	 Explain why our results cannot be maintained in Fox’s system if we assume that require and 
allowed are members of a Horn set? 

c.	 What distinguishes the two systems in this respect? In particular, should we modify Fox’s system 
so that it agrees with Sauerland’s in this respect? Are there considerations that go in the other 
direction? 

d.	

e.	

f.	

Is it reasonable to claim that there is no Horn‐set with allowed and required as members? 

Is it reasonable to claim that even if allowed is a formal alternative of required (members of a 
Horn‐set), allowed may be ignored in a particular context, by something akin to the general 
process of contextual domain restriction? 

Can you think of an alternative solution to the problem given the theory of alternatives

proposed in Fox and Katzir’s paper?


2.	 Discuss similar questions for the following: 

(2)  Few students did any of the readings. 

a.	 Compute implicatures (in the two systems) under the assumption that few has no in its Horn‐
Set, and no other phrase in the sentence is a member of a Horn‐Set. 

b.	 Explain why the results cannot be maintained in Fox’s system if we assume that any and all are 
members of a Horn set? 

c.	

d.	

Is it reasonable to claim that there is no Horn‐set with any  and all as members? 

Is it reasonable to claim that if all is a formal alternative of any (members of a Horn‐set), all may 
be ignored in a particular context, by something akin to the general process of contextual 
domain restriction? 

e.	 Can you think of an alternative solution to the problem given the theory of alternatives

proposed in Fox and Katzir’s paper?
