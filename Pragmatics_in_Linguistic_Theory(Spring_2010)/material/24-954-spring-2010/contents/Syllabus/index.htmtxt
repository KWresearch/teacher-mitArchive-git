***** Overview *****
This course is the third and final part of our graduate introduction to
semantics. The other two classes are 24.970 Introduction to Semantics and
24.973 Advanced Semantics. The semester will be divided into somewhat
independent units. One unit will be devoted to conversational implicatures
(mainly scalar implicatures) and another to presupposition. In each unit, we
will discuss basic concepts and technical tools and then devote some time to
recent work which illustrates their application.
***** Prerequisites *****
24.970 and 24.973 or approximately equivalent background. I will presuppose
technical material more or less on the level of [Amazon_logo] Heim, Irene, and
Angelika Kratzer. Semantics in Generative Grammar. Malden, MA: Blackwell
Publishers, 1998, pp. 1-32. ISBN: 9780631197133. You should be familiar with
possible world semantics of modal and attitude constructions, as well as basic
concepts from syntactic theory.
***** Course requirements *****
**** Homework Exercises ****
Occasionally you will be assigned short homework assignments based on the
topics covered in lectures.
**** Squib ****
A squib consists of critical discussion of an article (or a group of related
articles) which is relevant to the topics covered in this class. Students will
choose a topic of interest, and turn in a squib on the last day of class. You
will also be required to turn in a short proposal during the semester.
**** Reading Assignments ****
Only a few papers will be required reading for the whole class. This will leave
you plenty of time to browse through related literature and find things to
write your squib about, and you should begin with that immediately.
