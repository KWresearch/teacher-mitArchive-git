Good match between present-day distribution of active eolian dune fields and worldwide

Aridity is define as P/ETp where P = precipitation and ETp = ability of solar radiation and 
vegetation to return moisture to the atmosphere by evaporation and evapotranspiration

Correlation between aridity and eolian landforms make eolian deposits attractive candidates 
for paleoclimate studies.
Complicating issue: Inherited source of wind blown sediment.  These sources of sediment can 
overwhelm potential substrate stabilization by plants.

Relatively unique aspect of eolian system: fluid is very thick/deep (atmosphere) and 
excursion lengths for small particles can be very long (e.g., breadth of Atlantic Ocean).

Erg = genetically related assemblage of draas

Interdraa and interdune areas can be dry or wet and in some cases be sites of flowing 
water.

In many cases there is not sufficient wind-blown sediment to completely cover landscape.

Barchan dunes develop under these sediment-limited conditions.

Great debate about whether inter-draa horizons represent:
1. Regional water-table surfaces (Implying preservation is connected to climate-
change), or
Bedform climb.

2.

Climb model requires a lot of sediment coming into the depositional system.

Foreset stratification associated with eolian dunes is the product of grain-flow and air-fall deposits.  
Air-fall sedimentation produces the tangential strata at bounding surfaces.

Translatent ripple stratification is common in eolian ripple deposits. Stratification is produced 
by ripples climbing at angles << stoss-side angle.

Collision Stokes Number

Interparticle collision of natural sediment grains in water, Water 
Resources Research, v. 37 (9), p. 2377–2391, Sept. 2001
When a saltating particle contacts a bed particle, the result may be either a partially 
elastic rebound or viscous damping by the fluid that must be expelled from the gap 
between the two particles.

The appropriate physical scaling of this problem is a collision Stokes number:
Measure of the inertia of the particle relative to the viscous pressure force 
(hydrodynamic force) exerted on the particle by the fluid.

where ρs is the sediment density, D is particle diameter, u is 
the velocity of approach between the two particles, and µ
is the dynamic viscosity of the transporting fluid.  

If St is small, < ∼ 39 Viscously damped collision: viscous pressure will stop the particle before 
significant elastic energy can be stored in the deformation of the particles. 
In this case, there will be no initial rebound velocity.

St is large, > ∼ 105 Partially elastic collision: rebounding particles not significantly affected by 
interstitial fluid.

If transporting fluid is water, St is small for all sand particles.

If transporting fluid is air, St is large for all sand particles.

Impact or ballistic ripples
Kinetic energy of the impacting grain > energy necessary to raise a similar grain out of its 
pocket in the bed against the force of gravity.

saltation

Bagnold estimated 6x as many grain moved 
by surface creep than by saltation.

Hypothesis: Tight distribution of particle-ejection velocities translates into tight 
distribution of characteristic grain-excursion lengths, setting ripple wavelength.
