            DOWNSTREAM SORTING OF SEDIMENT 
(additional control on channel width, depth and slope)

As the gravel gets finer, it is transported at lower slopes.  The result is 
tendency to strengthen the upward concavity of a river profile.

The image shows a) the long profile of the Kinu River, Japan and b) the 
profile of median grain size in the same river. The river undergoes a 
sudden transition from gravel-bed to sand-bed before reaching the sea.

Stratification often defines bar 
topography.

The shingled arrangement of adjacent particles is called imbrication and is most easily seen in 
gravelly deposits.  Studies of clast imbrication can be used to constrain paleocurrent directions.

Do not be fooled: Many contacts between adjacent particles may not be observed in a 2D 
cut through the grain framework.

These deposits preserve shallow topography of channels on the fan 
through time.  Conglomerates are buried beneath a volcanic flow (white 
bed) and the whole section is rotated by younger faulting. [P. Heller]

Overbank sedimentation

Rates of overbank sedimentation are greatest near channel margins, producing natural levees.

Debris Flows: A  class of flows containing so much sediment that the particles are nearly 
touching.  Their water component is interstitial and behaves as a pore fluid.  

Debris flow mobility can be facilitated by:
1. Elastic collisions causing grains to vibrate enough for particles can move past each other.  
Inertial effect – typically associated with large surface slopes (i.e., grain flows)

2.  Mixture of fine-grained sediment suspended in the water increases the viscosity of the fluid.  
Viscous effect – hinders motion of fluid around grains and effectively combines sediment +water so 
that for some period of time they move down slope as approximately a single phase.

3.  Densification of the sediment framework by shear strain, transferring part of the vertical normal 
stress onto the pore fluid.  High pore pressures – promote liquefaction of mixtures.

The Herschel-Bulkley
constitutive equation is 
commonly used to describe 
the steady and uniform flow 
of debris flows.
