Stratigraphy = Study of rock strata
These strata preserve an integrated response of depositional systems to tectonics, 
sediment flux, sea level, subsidence, climate, and other environmental forcings.

Strata are classified with respect to any one of many characteristics. 
For example: classification based on:
Lithology (cid:198) “lithostratigraphy”
Fossil content (cid:198) “biostratigraphy”
Age (cid:198) “chronostratigraphy”
Chemical composition (cid:198) “chemostratigraphy”
Magnetic properties (cid:198) “magnetostratigraphy”
Stratal geometries (cid:198) “sequence stratigraphy”

Facies = Body of rock with specified characteristics

Physical/chemical attributes (cid:198) “lithofacies”

Fossil assemblages (cid:198) “biofacies”

Tectonic significance (cid:198) ‘tectofacies”

For sedimentary rocks, “homogeneous” means relatively constant facies.

Formation = Lithologically distinctive, relatively homogeneous succession of strata that is 
mappable at 1:25,000 scale

History of Stratigraphic Concepts

Superposition:  Steno, 1669
Law of superposition:  In any succession of strata, not subsequently disturbed or overturned 
since deposition, younger rocks lie above older rocks.

Unconformities:  Hutton, 1788
Surfaces separating strata that are not in immediate order of age (i.e. represent missing 
time). 
1.
Angular unconformity
2. Disconformity
3.
Paraconformity
4. Nonconformity

Faunal Succession: Smith, 1800
Law of faunal succession: Rocks formed during a particular interval of geologic time 
can be recognized and distinguished by their fossil content from rocks formed during 
other time intervals.

Facies Succession: Walther, 1893
Walther’s Law: Facies occurring in conformable vertical succession must have occurred
in laterally adjacent environments.

Sequence Stratigraphy:  Wheeler, 1950s; Sloss, 1960s; Vail et al., 1970s

Motivation:  Utility of the sedimentary record to the study of long-term landscape and seascape 
evolution depends on an ability to distinguish between various forcing functions. 

Requires the separation of
Autogenic Processes (intrinsic variability within the depositional system driven by the nonlinear 
coupling between fluid flow, sediment transport, and surface morphology)

from

Allogenic Processes (initial and boundary conditions for the system)
qs = sediment discharge,  qw = water discharge   (initial conditions)
σ = subsidence rate,  H = base level  (boundary conditions)
