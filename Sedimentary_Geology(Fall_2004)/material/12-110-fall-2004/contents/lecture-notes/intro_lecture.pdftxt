Earth’s surface is “the environment” that supports all life and human activity. 
 
Surface is the interface between solid-Earth, ocean, and atmosphere. 
 
The  stratigraphic  record – a  time  sequence of depositional  surfaces –  is our window  to  the  long view of 
surface dynamics. 
It allows us to; 
1.  image alternative surface states and configurations on planetary time scales,  
2.  measure rates of change both abrupt and gradual,  
3.  study large-scale connections that are only weakly expressed on human time scales, and 
4.  give context to the snapshot that is the Earth’s surface today.  
Known  major  features  of  the  Earth-surface  system  include  self-organization,  localization,  autogenic 
fluctuations, strong history dependence, and strong interconnections. 
Fortunately,  we  have  the  nearly  four-billion  year  stratigraphic  record  and  its  numerous  realizations  of 
the  behavior  of  the  surface  system.  Only  in  the  long  record  of  Earth  history  can  we  measure  the 
variability, and thus the predictability, of the planetary surface system. 
 
 
Grand Challenges 
 
1.  Understand how surface processes operate across the full range of planetary length scales, time 
scales, and conditions, including extreme states. 
As  we  move  from  human  to  planetary  time  and  length  scales  our  conceptual  framework  changes:  the 
rare event becomes commonplace; slow but powerful  tectonic sources and sinks become  important; and 
the full array of Earth-system configurations emerges. 
Our  planet’s  history  includes  a  remarkable  array  of  extreme  events  and  states  (e.g.,  superwarming, 
snowball Earth, oceanic anoxia, CO2 enrichment and elevated weathering, and changing composition of 
diversity and life). 
 
2.  Understand  the  resolution,  biasing,  and  filter  properties  of  the  stratigraphic  record.  Because 
the  stratigraphic  record  filters  information  about  earth-surface  conditions,  our  ability  to  image  past 
states of the Earth is limited by our ability to quantify these filters in terms of both their deterministic 
and  statistical  components.    For  example,  stratigraphic  sequences  control  patterns  of  species’  first 
and  last  occurrences,  affecting  the  reliability  of  biostratigraphic  correlations,  evolutionary 
interpretations  and  paleoecological  reconstruction.    Similarly,  the  same  processes  that  control  time-
averaging  and  stratigraphic  architecture  also  modify  geochemical  and  other  proxy  data  for 
ecological, climate and other environmental analyses. 

 
3.   Determine  the  roles  of  organisms  in  Earth-surface  dynamics.  Research  in  surface  dynamics  on 
all  time  scales  demonstrate  the  myriad  ways  in  which  organisms  influence  and  are  influenced  by 
surface conditions and processes. 
The evolution of life has had major impacts on Earth’s surface at several scales, such as the colonization 
of land by plants. 
Among  organisms,  humans  have  affected  Earth-surface  systems  through  the  introduction  of 
greenhouse gases, overturning and mixing of surface materials, modifications of stream flow and runoff,

and  elevation of  solute  and  solid  loads  to  the  seas.   Geohistorical  records  are  the  only means  to  acquire 
the baseline information on natural variability against which anthropogenic effects must be measured. 
 
4.  Use the sedimentary record to develop and evaluate Earth-system models. Theoretical modeling 
of  surface  dynamics  is  developing  rapidly.  But  Earth’s  surface,  with  strong  nonlinearity  and  many 
interacting parts, can behave  in unexpected ways  that make  theoretical modeling futile unless paired 
closely with observation. 
If  the  Earth’s  surface  were  simple  enough,  we  could  test  surface-process  models  in  the  modern  world 
over short time scales and then just extend them to long times to reproduce Earth history. But everything 
we know about complex, nonlinear  systems  suggests  that  this would be a very naïve approach. System-
scale models must  be  tested  on  the  time  and  space  scales  over  which  whole-system  behavior  is  played 
out.    In  the  case  of  the  Earth’s  surface  this  means  model  testing  on  planetary  time  scales.  The  only 
surface data available on these time scales are those recorded in stratigraphy. 
Ultimately,  we  must  try  to  “break”  our  models  by  taking  them  to  their  limits.  Any  reliable 
general model must reproduce the behavior of non-analog worlds as well the singular modern world. To 
do  that,  we  need  data  from  the  Earth  at  its  limits:  periods  of  crisis  and  extremes  such  as  anoxia,  biotic 
crises, and climatic extremes. 
 
 
The  fundamental  challenge  of  sedimentary  geology:  developing  an  analytical  understanding  of  Earth-
surface history. 
Analytical = estimating paleovariables quantitatively rather than settling for qualitative descriptions. 
 

 

 

 

Sedimentary rocks only make up 5% of the Earth's crust, but cover about 75% of the surface of the 
earth. 

Sedimentary rocks have an average thickness of about 1800 m on the continents.  This 
thickness is quite variable, however, with some areas, like the Canadian Shield having no cover 
of sedimentary rocks, and other areas, like the Louisiana and Texas Gulf coasts, having more 
than 15,000 m of sedimentary rock cover.  About 66% of all continental areas have a cover of 
sedimentary rocks. 
Because sediment gets buried, and if exposed is subjected 
to erosion, older sedimentary rocks show less exposed 
outcrop area than younger sedimentary rocks. Over 40% 
of the exposed sedimentary rocks are younger than 
Cretaceous in age.
