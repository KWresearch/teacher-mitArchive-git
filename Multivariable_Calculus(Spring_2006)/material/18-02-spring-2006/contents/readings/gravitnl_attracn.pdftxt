G .   Gravitational Attract ion  

We  use  triple  integration  t o  calculate t h e  gravitational  a t t r a c t ion  t h a t   a  solid body  V  of 
mass M  exerts on  a  unit  point  mass  placed  a t   t h e  origin. 

If  t h e  solid  V  is  also  a  point  mass,  then   according  t o   Newton's  law  of  gravitation,  t h e  
force  i t   exerts is  given by 

where R is t h e  position  vector  from  t h e  origin  0 t o  th e  point  V ,  and  t h e  
unit  vector  r = R/IRI  is  i t s  direction.

If  however  t h e  solid body  V  is no t   a  point  mass, we  have  t o  use  integration.  We  concen- 
t r a t e   on  finding  just  t h e   k  component  of  t h e   gravitational  a t t r a c t ion  - all  our  examples 
will  have  t h e   solid  body  V  placed  symmetrically  so  t h a t   i t s  pull  is  all  in   t h e   k  direction 
anyway. 

To calculate th is  force, we  divide up  t h e  solid V  in to  small pieces having volume  A V  a n d  
mass  Am .   If  t h e   density  function  is  S (x ,  y , z ) ,  we  have  for  t h e   piece  containing  t h e   point 
(5 , Y ,  z )  

Thinking  of  th is   small  piece  a s  being  essentially  a  point  mass  a t   (x ,  y ,  z ) ,  t h e   force  A F  i t  
exerts on  t h e  unit  mass  a t  t h e  origin  is  given by  ( I . ) ,   and  i t s   k  component  AF,  is  therefore

If  we  sum  all t h e  contributions t o  t h e  force from  each of  t h e  mass  elements A m  and  pass t o  
t h e  limit, we  get  for  t h e   k-component  of  th e  gravitational  force

If  t h e   integral  is  in   spherical  coordinates,  then   dV  = p 2 s i n 4 d p d 4 d 0 ,   and   t h e   integral 
becomes

Example  1. 
F ind   t h e   gravitational  a t t rac t ion   of  t h e   upper  half  of  a  solid  sphere  of 
radius  a  centered  a t  t h e  origin,  if  i t s  density  is  given by  6 = Jw. 
Solution. 
Since  t h e   solid  a n d   i ts   density  a r e  symmetric  abou t   t h e   z-axis,  t h e   force 
will  be  in  t h e   k -direction,  and  we  can use  (3) or  (4 ) .   Since 

t h e  integral is 

F,  = G JdZn Jdni2 Jda  p  sin2 $ cos $ d p  dm do 
which  evaluates  easily  t o  r rGa2 /3  . 

Example  2 .   Let  V  b e   t h e   solid  spherical  cap  obtained  by  slicing  a 
solid sphere of  radius  a f i   by  a  plane a t  a  distance a  from t h e  center of  t h e  
sphere.  F ind   t h e  gravitational  a t t rac t ion   of  V  on  a  unit  point  mass  a t  t h e  
center  of  t h e  sphere.  (Take  t h e  density  t o  be  1 . )  

Solution.  To  take   advantage  of  t h e   symmetry,  place  t h e   origin  a t   t h e   center  of  t h e  
sphere, and   align  t h e   axis of  t h e  cap  along  t h e  z-axis  (so t h e  flat  side of  t h e   cap  is  parallel 
t o  t h e  xy-plane) . 
We  use  spherical  coordinates; t h e  main  problem  is  determining t h e   limits  of  integration. 
If  we  fix $ a n d  8  and   let  p  vary, we  get  a  ray which  enters V  a t  i t s  flat  side 

and   leaves  V  on  i t s   spherical  side,  p  = a f i .   Th e   rays  which  intersect  V  in  th is   way  a r e  
those for which  0 5 $ 5 ~ / 4 ,a s  one  sees from t h e  picture.  Thus   by  (4 ) ,  

which  after  integrating with  respect  t o  p  (and 8) becomes 

Remark.  Newton  proved  t h a t  a solid sphere of  uniform  density  a n d  mass M exerts t h e  
same force on  an  external  point  mass  a s  would  a  point  mass M  placed  a t  t h e   center  of  t h e  
sphere.  (See Problem  6 a ) .  

This does  no t  however generalize  t o  o the r  uniform  solids of  mass M - i t   is  not  t r u e  t h a t  
t h e   gravitational  force  they  exert  is  t h e   same  a s   t h a t   of  a  point  mass  M  a t   the i r   center 
of  mass.  For  if  th is   were  so,  a  un i t   tes t   mass  placed  on  t h e   axis  between  two  equal  point 
masses  M  and   M'  ought  t o  b e   pulled  toward  t h e  midposition,  whereas  actually  i t   will  be 
pulled  toward  t h e  closer of  t h e  two masses.
