TA.  The Tangent Approximation 

1.  Partial  derivatives 
Let  w  = f  (x ,  y)  be  a  function  of  two  variables.  I t s   g raph   is  a  surface  in  xyz-space,  a s  
pictured. 
w 

F ix  a  value y = yo  and  just  let x  vary.  You  get  a  function  of  o n e  variable,

w = f  (x ,  yo ) ,  

t h e  pa r t ia l  func t ion  for  y = yo. 

I t s  g raph  is a  curve in t h e  vertical plane y = yo, whose slope a t  t h e  
point  P where  x  = xo  is  given  by  t h e  derivative

We  call  (2) t h e  pa r t ia l  der ivat ive  of  f  with  respect  t o  x  a t  t h e  point  (xo, yo ) ;  t h e  right  side 
of  (2)  is  t h e  s t and a rd  no ta t ion  for  i t .   T h e  pa r t ia l   derivative  is  just  t h e   ordinary  derivative 
of  th e   pa r t ia l   function  - i t   is  calculated  by  holding  one  variable  fixed  and   differentiating 
with  respect  t o  th e  other  variable.  O the r  notations for  th is  pa r t ia l   derivative  a r e

t h e   first  is  convenient  for  including  t h e   specific  point;  t h e   second  is  common  in  science 
a n d   engineering,  where  you  a re   just  dealing  with  relations  between  variables  and   don't 
mention  t h e   function  explicitly;  t h e   th i rd   and   fou r th   indicate  t h e   point  by  just  using  a 
single  subscript. 
Analogously, fixing x  = xo  and   letting  y  vary, we  get  t h e  pa r t ia l   function  w  = f  (xo, y ) ,  
whose g raph  lies in  t h e  vertical plane  x = xo ,  and  whose slope  a t  P is  t h e  partial   de r iva t ive  
o f f   w i t h   respect   t o  y ;  th e  notations  a r e  

Th e  pa r t ia l  derivatives d f  l d x  and   d f  l d y  depend  on  ( x o ,  yo) and  a r e  therefore  functions of 
x  a n d y .  

Written  as  a w / d x ,   t h e  partial  derivatrive  gives  t h e   r a t e  of  change  of  w  with  respect  t o  
x  alone, a t  t h e  point  ( x o ,  YO): i t  tells  how  fast w  is  increasing as x  increases, when  y  is  held 
cons tan t .  
For  a  function  of  th ree  or more  variables,  w = f  (x ,  y ,  z ,  . . . ) ,  we  canno t  draw graphs  any 
more,  bu t   t h e   idea  behind  partial  differentiation  remains  t h e   same:  t o   define  t h e   partial 
derivative with  respect  t o  x ,  for  instance, hold  all th e  other  variables cons tan t  and  take  t h e  
ordinary  derivative with  respect  t o  x ;  t h e  notations  a re  t h e  same a s  above:

Your  book  has   examples  illustrating  th e   calculation  of  partial  derivatives  for  functions  of 
two  and  th ree  variables. 

2.  The  tangent  plane. 
For  a  function  of  one variable, w = f ( x ) ,  t h e  tangen t   line  t o  i t s  g raph  a t  a  point  ( X O ,  W O )  
is  th e  line  passing  th rough   (xo ,  wo) and  having  slope  ($1  . 
For  a  function  of  two variables, w = f ( x ,  y ) ,  t h e  n a tu r a l  analogue  is  t h e   t a n g e n t  p l a n e   t o  
th e  g raph ,  a t   a  point  ( x o ,  yo, wo ) .  Wha t 's  t h e  equation of  th is   tangen t   plane?  Referring t o  
t h e  picture of  t h e  g raph  on  t h e  preceding page,  we  see t h a t   t h e  tangen t   plane 
(i) must  pass  through  (xo ,yo, W O )  , where  wo  = f (xo,YO ) ;  
(ii)  must  contain t h e  tangen t   lines  t o  t h e  graphs of  t h e  two pa r t ia l   functions - th is  will 
hold  if  t h e  plane has  t h e  same slopes  in  t h e   i  and   j  directions  a s  t h e  surface does. 
Using  these  two  conditions,  i t   is  easy  t o   find  t h e   equation  of  t h e   tangen t   plane.  Th e  
general equation of  a  plane  through  (XO ,  yo, wo)  is 

Assume  t h e  plane  is  no t   vertical;  th en   C  # 0,  so we  can  divide th rough   by  C  and  solve for 
w - wo,  getting 

w - wo  =  a ( x  - $0) + b(y - yo ) ,  
(3) 
Th e  plane  passes  through  ( x o ,  yo, wo ) ;  what  values  of  t h e   coefficients a  a n d   b  will  make  i t  
also  tangen t   t o  t h e  g raph  there?  We  have 
a  =  slope of  plane  (3)  in  t h e   i -d i rec t ion  
=  slope of  graph  in  t h e   i-direction, 

(by  pu t t ing   y = yo  in   (3 ) ) ;  
(by  (ii)  above) 

a  = A IC ,   b  = B I C .  

(by  t h e  definition of  pa r t ia l   derivative); 

similarly, 

Therefore t h e  equation of  t h e  tangent  plane t o  w = f ( x ,y )   a t   ($0, yo)  is 

Your  book  has  examples of  calculating  tangen t   planes,  using  (4 ) .  

3 .   The  approximation formula. 
T h e  most  impo r tan t   use  for  t h e   tangen t   plane  is  t o   give  a n   approximation  t h a t   is  t h e  
basic  formula  in  t h e   s tudy   of  functions  of  several variables - almost  everything follows in 
one way  or  another  from  i t .  

T h e  intuitive idea  is  t h a t   if  we  s tay  near  ($0, yo, wo), t h e  g raph  of  t h e  tangen t   plane  (4) 
will  be  a  good  approximation  t o   t h e   g raph   of  t h e   function  w  = f (x, Y ) .   Therefore  if  th e

T h e  function  on  t h e  right  side of  (5) whose graph  is  t h e  tangen t  plane  is  often  called  t h e  
linearization of  f (x ,  y)  a t  ( x o ,  yo):  i t   is  t h e  linear  function which  gives t h e  best  approxima- 
tion  t o  f (x ,  y)  for  values  of  ( x ,  y)  close to   (50 ,  YO ) .  
An  equivalent form  of  t h e  approximation  (5)  is  obtained by  using  A  no ta t ion ;   if  we  pu t  

then   (5) becomes 

This  formula  gives  t h e  approximate  change  in w when  we  make  a  small  change  in  x  and  y. 
We  will  use  it  often.

Unfortunately,  for  functions  of  th ree  or more  variables, we  can't use  a  geometric  argument 
for  t h e  approximation  formula  (7); for  th is   reason,  it's best  t o  recast  t h e   argument  for  (6) 
in  a  form which  doesn't  use  tangent  planes  and  geometry, and  therefore  can  be  generalized 
t o  several  variables.  Th is   is  done  a t  t h e  end  of  this  Chap te r  TA;  for  now  let's  just  assume

Here  a r e  two  typical  examples of  t h e  use  of  t h e  approximation formula.  O th e r  examples 
a r e  in  t h e  Exercises.  In  t h e  rest  of  your  s tudy  of  partial  differentiation, you will  see how  t h e  
approximation formula is  used  t o  derive  t h e  impo r tan t   theorems  and  formulas. 
Example  1.  Give  a  reasonable  square,  centered  a t   (1 ,  I ) ,   over  which  t h e   value  of 
w = x3y4 will  no t   vary  by  more  t h a n  f .1 . 
Solution.  We  use  (6).  We  calculate for  t h e  two partial  derivatives 

and  therefore,  evaluating t h e  partials  a t   ( 1 , l )  and  using  (6), we  get 

Thus  if  1 Ax1  5  .Ol  and  Ay 1  < .Ol, we  should have 

which  is within  t h e  bounds.  So t h e  answer  is  t h e  square with  center  a t   ( 1 , l )  given  by

thu s  i t  is most sensitive t o  small changes in  side a ,  since A a  occurs with t h e  largest coefficient. 
(Th a t   is,  if  one  a t   a  t ime   t h e  measurement  of  each  side were  changed  by  say  .01,  i t   is  t h e  
change  in  a  which would  produce  t h e  biggest  change  in  V ,  namely  .06  .) 

Th e   result  may  seem  paradoxical  - t h e   value  of  V  is  most  sensitive  t o   t h e

abou t   how  t h e  box  looks.

corresponding p a r t i a l  derivative w,,  w,,  . . . h a s   the  largest  absolute  value  a t  th e  po in t .  

4.  Critique of  the  approximation formula. 
First  of  all, t h e  approximation formula  (6) is no t   a precise ma thema t ica l  s t a t em en t ,  since 
th e  symbol NN  does no t   specify exactly how close t h e  quan t i t i tes  on  either side of  t h e  formula 
a r e  to  each other.  To fix  this  up ,  one would have  t o  specify t h e  error  in  t h e  approximation. 
(This can be  done,  bu t   it  is  not  often  used.) 
A  more fundamental objection  is t h a t  our discussion of  approximations was based  on t h e  
assumption  t h a t   t h e   tangen t   plane  is  a  good  approximation  t o  t h e   surface  a t   ( x o ,  yo, wo). 
Is  th is   really  so? 

Look  a t  i t   th is  way.  T h e  tangent  plane was  determined a s  t h e  plane which  has  t h e  same 
slope  a s   t h e   surface  in  t h e   i  and   j directions.  This  means  t h e   approximation  (6)  will  be 
good  if  you  move  away  from  (xo, yo)  in  t h e   i  direction  (by  tak ing   Ay  = 0 ) ,  or  in  th e   j 
direction  (pu t t ing  A x  = 0 ) .   Bu t   does  t h e  tangen t  plane have  t h e  same slope  a s  t h e  surface 
in  all  t h e  other  directions  a s  well? 

Intuitively,  we  should  expect  t h a t   th is   will  b e   so  if  t h e   g raph   of  f ( x ,  y )   is  a  "smooth" 
surface  a t   ( s o ,  yo) - i t   doesn't have  any  sha rp  points,  folds,  or  look  peculiar.  Here  is  t h e  
mathematical  hypothesis  which  guarantees this. 

S m o o t h n e s s  h y p o t h e s i s .   We  say  f (x ,  y)  is  smooth  a t   ( xO ,  yo) if 

f,  a n d  f,  a r e  continuous in some rectangle centered  a t  ( xO ,  yo ) .  

(8) 
If  (8) holds,  t h e  approximation formula  (6) will  be  valid. 

Though  pathological  examples can be  constructed, in general  t h e  normal  way  a  function 
fails  t o  be  smoo th   (and  in  t u r n   (6) fails t o  hold)  is  t h a t   one  or bo th   pa r t ia l   derivatives  fail 
t o  exist  a t   ( x o ,  yo).  Th is  means  of  course  t h a t   you  won't  even be  able  t o  write  t h e   formula 
(6 ) ,  unless  you're  sleepy.  Here  is a  simple example. 
E x a m p l e  3.  Where  is  w = Jwsmooth?  Discuss.

These a r e  continuous  a t  all  points  except  (O,O), where  they   a r e  undefined.  So t h e   function 
is  smooth  except  a t   t h e  origin;  t h e   approximation  formula  (6)  should  be  valid  everywhere 
except  a t  t h e  origin. 
Indeed, investigating  t h e  g raph  of  this  function, since w = d

w says t h a t  

height  of  g raph  over  (x ,  y )   =  distance of  (x ,  y )   from w-axis, 

/--
t h e   graph  is  a  right  circular  cone,  with  vertex  a t   (0, O),  axis  along  t h e   w-axis,  and   vertex 
angle a  right angle.  Geometrically t h e  g raph  has a  sh a rp  point  a t  t h e  origin, so the re  should 
be  no  tangen t   plane  the re ,   and   no  valid  approximation  formula  (6) - the re   is  no  linear 
function  which  approximates  a  cone  a t  i t s  vertex. 
A  non-geometrical argument  for  the  approximation formula 

We  promised  earlier  a  non-geometrical approach  t o  t h e  approximation  formula  (6) t h a t  
would  generalize  t o   higher-dimensions,  in  particular  t o   t h e   bv a r i ab l e   formula  (7).  This 
approach will  also  show  why  th e  hypothesis  (8) of  smoothness is  needed.  T h e  argument  is 
still  imprecise,  since  i t   uses  t h e  symbol  z ,  bu t   it  can  be  refined  t o  a  proof  (which  you  will 
find  in your  book,  though  it's not  easy  reading). 
I t   uses  t h e  one-variable approximation formula  for  a  differentiable function  w = f (u )   : 

We wish t o  justify -without  using reasoning based  on b s p a c e  -t h e  approximation formula 

We  a re  trying  t o  calculate  t h e  change  in w  as we  go from P t o  R  in  t h e  
picture,  where  P = ( x o ,yo ) ,   R = (xo  + Ax ,  yo + Ay ) .   Th is   change can  be 
thought  of  as  taking  place  in  two  steps: 

X0+&

t h e   first  being  t h e   change  in  w  as  you  move  from  P t o   Q ,   t h e   second  th e   change  as  you 
move from Q  t o  R.  Using  th e  one-variable  approximation formula  (9)  : 

similarly, 

if  we  assume  t h a t   f y  is  continuous  (i.e., f is  smoo th ) ,  since  t h e  difference between  t h e  two 
terms  on  t h e  right  in  t h e  last  two  lines will  then   b e   like E  Ay ,  which  is  negligible  compared 
with  either  te rm   itself.  Subs t i tu t ing   th e   two  approximate  values  (11)  and   (12)  in to   (10) 
gives us  t h e  approximation formula  (6 ) .

18.02  NOTES  

To make th is  a proof, t h e  error te rms  in t h e  approximations have t o  be analyzed, or more 
simply, one has t o  replace t h e  z symbol by  equalities based  on t h e  Mean-Value  Theorem of 
one-variable  calculus. 

This argument readily generalizes t o  t h e  higher-dimensional  approximation formulas, such 
a s   (7);  again  t h e   essential  hypothesis  would  be  smoothness:  t h e   th ree   partial  derivatives 
w,,  w,,  w,  should  be  continuous  in  a  neighborhood  of  t h e  point  (so ,  yo, 20).
