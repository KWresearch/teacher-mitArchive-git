we  have by  the  F.T.C.  for  line  integrals,

This  difference  on  the  right-hand  side  is  maximized  if  s i n x l  cos yl  is  maximized,  and 
sin xo  cos yo  is  minimized.  Since  I sin x cos yl  = I sin X I   I cos yl  5 1, the   difference on  the  right

(For  example,  a C running  from  ( - ~ / 2 , 0 )  t o   (7r/2,0) gives  this  maximum value.)

4C-5 a )  F is  a  gradient  field  only  if  My  = N,, 
t h a t   is,  if  2y  = a y ,  so a = 2. 
By inspection, th e  potential  function  is  f (x , y) = xY 2+ x2 + c ;   YOU  can check t h a t   F = V f .  
b )  T h e  equation M y  = Nx becomes ex+Y(x+a) = x e x + ~ + e x + Y ,which = ex+Y(x+ 1 ) .  
Therefore a = 1 .  

To find  t h e  potential  function f (x , y ) ,  using Method  2 we  have 
f z  = eYex(x+ 1 )   + f (x, y) = eYxex + g(y). 
Differentiating,  and  comparing t h e  result  with  N ,  we  find 
f y   = eYxex + g l (y )  = xeX+y;therefore  g l (y )  = 0 ,  so g (y )  = c  and   f ( a , y)  = x ex+Y + c. 

4C-6 a )   ydx - xdy  is  not  exact,  since M y  = 1bu t   N ,   = -1. 
(2x + y )  dx  + x(2y + x )  dy  is  exac t ,  since  M y  = 2x + 2y  = N,. 
b) 
Using Method  1 t o  find  t h e  potential  function  f ( x , y),  we  calculate t h e  
line  integral over  t h e  s t and a rd  broken  line  p a th   shown,  C  = 9+ C2 .  

On  C1  we  have y = 0  and  dy  = 0, so L F . d r  = 0. 
On  C 2 , we  have x  = x l   and   dx = 0 ,  so  J c , ~ . d ~= l y 1 x 1 ( 2 y+ x l ) d x = x l y :   + x ? y l .  
Therefore,  f (x , y) = x2y  + xy2 ;  t o  get  all  possible  functions,  add   + c   .

4E-2  All  t h e   vectors  of  F  have  length  f i  and   point  no r theas t .   So  t h e   flux  across  a  line

4G .   Simply-connected Regions 
4 G - 1   Hypotheses:  t h e   region  R  is  simply  connected,  F  =  M i  + N j   has  continuous 
derivatives in  R ,  and   curl F = 0  in  R .  

Conclusion:  F is  a  gradient  field  in R 

(o r ,  M dx + N  dy  is  an   exact  differential). 
a )   curl F = 2y - 2y  = 0, a n d  R  is  t h e  whole xy-plane.  Therefore  F = Vf  in  t h e  plane. 
b)  curl F = -y  sin x  - x sin y # 0, so t h e  differential  is  no t   exac t .  
c)  curl  F = 0,  bu t   R  is  t h e   exterior  of  t h e   unit  circle,  which  is  no t   simply-connected; 
criterion  fails. 

d )   curl F = 0, and   R  is  t h e   interior  of  th e  unit  circle, which  is  simply-connected,  so  t h e  
differential  is  exact. 

e )   curl  F = 0  and  R  is  th e  first  quad ran t ,  which  is  simply-connected,  so F is  a  gradient 
field. 

c)  Using Method  1 ,  we  take  t h e  origin a s  t h e  s ta r t ing  point  and  use  t h e  s t ra igh t  line 
t o   (X I ,y l )   a s  t h e  p a t h   C.  In   polar  coordinates, x l   = T I   cosO1,  yl  = T I   sin e l ;  we  use  T  a s  
t h e  pa rame te r ,  so  t h e  p a t h   is  C  : x  = T cos e l ,  y = T sin e l ,  0 5 T  5 1-1. Th en

i t s  center  of  mass  is  on  t h e  y-axis,  hence %  = 0  and   so J& x dA = 0.

a)  continuously  differentiable  for  x ,  y  > 0;  thus   R  is  t h e   first  quad ran t   without  t h e   two

b)  continuous  differentiable  if  r  <  1; thus   R  is  t h e   interior  of  t h e   unit  circle,  and   is 
simply-connected. 
c)  continuously differentiable  if  r  > 1; thus  R  is  t h e  exterior  of  t h e  unit  circle,  a n d  is no t  
simply-connected.
