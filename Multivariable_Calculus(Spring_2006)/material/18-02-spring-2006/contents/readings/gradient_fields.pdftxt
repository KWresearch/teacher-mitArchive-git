V12.  Gradient  Fields in Space 

1.  The  criterion for  gradient  fields.  The  curl  in space. 
We  seek  now  t o   generalize  t o   space our  earlier  criterion  (Section V2)  for  gradient  fields 
in  t h e  plane.

Th e   two  mixed  partial  derivatives  a r e  equal  since  they   a r e   continuous,  by  t h e   hypothesis 
t h a t   F is  continuously  differentiable.

For  theoretical purposes, i t  can b e  expressed more elegantly by  using t h e  three-dimensional 
vector  curl F.

V.  VECTOR   INTEGRAL   CALCLUS 
In  dealing with  a  plane vector  field  F = M ( x ,  y) i  + N ( x ,  y) j , we  gave  t h e  name  curl F 
t o   t h e   scalar  function  N,  - M y ,  whereas  for  a  vector  field  F  in  space,  curl  F  is  a  v e c t o r  
function.  However,  if  we  th ink   of  t h e   two-dimensional  field  F  a s   a  field  in  space  (i.e.,  one 
with zero  k -component  and  not depending on z) , then  using  definition  (3)  you  can compute 
t h a t  

curl F  =  (N,  - M y )  k  . 

Thus  curl F has only  a  k -component, so if  we  a r e  dealing just  with  two-dimensional fields, 
i t   is  na tu ra l   t o   give  t h e   name  curl  F just  t o  th is   k -componen t .   Th is   is  no t   a  universally 
accepted  terminology, however; some call  i t  t h e   "scalar curl",  o the rs  don ' t  use  any  name a t  
all for  N,  - M y .  

Naturally,  t h e   question  arises a s  t o  whether  t h e  converse of  (1')  is t r u e  - if  curl F = 0 ,  
is  F  a  gradient  field?  As  in  two  dimensionas,  th is   requires  some  so r t   of  restriction  on  t h e  
domain,  and   we  will  r e tu rn   t o  th is   point  after  we  have  studied  Stokes' theorem.  For  now 
we  will  assume t h e  domain  is  t h e  whole three-space,  in which  case i t   is  t rue :  

Theorem.  If  F  i s  continuously differentiable  for all x ,  y ,  z ,  

(4) 

cu r l  F  = 0 

F  =  V f ,  

for some differentiable f (x ,  y ,  z ) .  

We  will  prove  th is   la te r .   If  F  is  a  gradient  field,  we  can  calculate  t h e   corresponding 
(mathematical) potential  function  f (x, y, z )   by  t h e  three-dimensional  analogue of  either of 
t h e  two methods  described  before  (Section V2).  We  illustrate  with  a n  example. 
Example 1.  For wha t  value(s),  if  any, of  c will  F  =  y i + (x + cyz) j + (y2+ z 2 )  k  be 
a  conservative (i.e.,  gradient) field?  For  each  such c, find  a  corresponding potential  function 
f (x1y1 z ) .  
Solution.  Using  (1) a n d   (4), we  calculate t h e  relevant  pa r t ia l   derivatives: 

Thus   all  th ree   equations  in  (1)  a r e  satisfied  H  c  = 2.  For  th is   value  of  c,  we  now  find 
f (x, y ,  z )  by  two methods. 

M e t h o d  1.  We  use  t h e  second fundamental theorem  (Section V11,  ( l l ) ) ,  tak ing   (O ,0 ,0 )  
a s  a  convenient  lower  limit  for  t h e  integral, a n d  using  t h e  subscript  1 on  t h e  upper  limit  t o  
avoid  confusion with  t h e  variables  of  integration.  This  gives 

Since  t h e   integral  is  path-independent  for  t h e   choice  c  = 2,  we  can  use  any  p a th .   T h e  
usual  choice  is  t h e   p a t h   illustrated,  consisting  of  th ree   line  segments  C1 ,  C2  and   C3.  T h e  
parametrizations  for  them   a r e  (don't  write  these ou t   yourself - we  a r e  only  doing  it  here 
th is  first  t ime  t o  make  it  clear  how  t h e  line  integral is  being  calculated): 

C 1 :   x = x ,   y =O ,   z = O ;  
C 2 :   x = x l ,   y = y ,   z = O ;  
C 3 :   x = x 1 ,   y = 91,  Z = Z ;  

thus   dx  = dx ,   dy  = 0,  dz = 0; 
thus  d x = O ,   dy  = d y ,   d z = 0 ;  
thus  d x = O ,   dy  = 0 ,   dz  = d z .

Using  these, we  calculate t h e  line  integral  (5) over each  of  t h e  Ci in  tu rn :  

Dropping  subscripts, we  have  therefore  by  (5 ) ,  

where  we  have  added  an   a rb i t ra ry   constant  of  integration  t o  compensate  for  our  a rb i ta ry  
choice of  (O,0, 0)  as  t h e   lower  limit  of  integration - a  different  choice would  have  added  a 
constant  t o  t h e   right  side of  (6 ) .  
T h e  work  should  always be  checked; from  (6) one sees easily  t h a t   V f  =  F, t h e  field we 
s t a r t ed  with. 

Me thod  2.  Th is  requires  no  line  integrals,  bu t   t h e  work must  be  carried ou t   systemati- 
cally, otherwise  you'll get  lost  in  a  mess  of  equations. 
We  a re  looking  for  an   f (x ,  y, z )   such t h a t   (f,,  f,, f,)  =  (y,  x + 2yz,  y 2  + z 2 ) .  Th is   is 
equivalent  t o  t h e  th ree   equations 

From  t h e  first  equation,  integrating with  respect  t o  x  (holding y  and   z  fixed), we  get

f ( x , Y , z ) = x Y + g ( Y , z ) ,  

g  is  an   a rb i t ra ry   function

2 .   Exact  differentials 
J u s t   as  we  did  in  t h e   two-dimensional  case,  we  t rans la te   t h e   previous  ideas  into  t h e  
language  of  differentials. 

T h e  formal  expression 

which  appea rs  as t h e  integrand  in  our  line  integrals  is  called  a  differential.  If  f ( x ,  y ,  z )   is  a 
differentiable function,  th en   i ts  t o t a l   differential  (or just  differential)   is  defined  t o  be 

T h e  differential  (10) is  said  t o  be  e x a c t ,  in some domain  D  where  M ,  N  and  P a r e  defined, 
if  i t   is  t h e  to t a l  differential  of  some differentiable  function  f ( x ,  y ,  z )  in  th is   domain, t h a t  is, 
if  the re   exists  a n  f ( x ,  y ,  z )   in D  such  t h a t  

Criterion for  exact  differentials.  Let D  be a  domain  in  which M ,  N ,  P a r e  continu- 
ously differentiable.  Then in D ,  

(13) 

M d x + N d y + P d z  

i s e x a c t   j P y = N z ,   M z = P x ,   N,  = M y ;  

if D  i s  all of  3-space,  then  th e  converse i s  true: 
P y = N z ,   M z = P z ,   N z = M y   +  M d x + N d y + P d z  

(14) 

i s e x a c t .  

If  t h e  tes t   in  th is  criterion  shows t h a t  t h e  differential  (10) is exac t ,  t h e  function  f (x ,  y ,  z )  
may  be  found  be  either  method  1 or  method  2.  Th e   converse  (14)  is  t r u e   under  weaker 
hypotheses  abou t  D ,  which we  will  come back  t o  after we  have  taken   up  Stokes' Theorem.
