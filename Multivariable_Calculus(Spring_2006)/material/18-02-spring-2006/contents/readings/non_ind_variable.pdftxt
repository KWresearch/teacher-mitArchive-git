N .   Non-independent Variables 

1.  Partial  differentiation with  non-independent  variables. 
Up t o  now  in calculating partial  derivatives of  functions like w = f (x ,  y )  or w = f (x ,  y, z ) ,  
we  have  assumed  t h e   variables  x ,  y  (or  x ,  y , z )   were  independent.  However  in  real-world 
applications th is  is frequently not so.  Computing pa r t ia l  derivatives then  becomes confusing, 
bu t   i t   is  be t te r   t o   face  these  complications  now  while  you  a r e   still  in  a  calculus  course, 
t h a n   wait  t o   be  hit  with  them   a t   th e   same  time  t h a t   you  a r e   struggling  t o   cope with  t h e  
thermodynamics  or  economics or whatever  else  is  involved. 

For  example,  in  thermodynamics,  th ree   variables  t h a t   a r e   associated  with  a  contained 
gas  a r e  i ts  

p  =  pressure, 
T  =  tempe ra tu re ,  
v  =  volume, 
and  you  can  express  o the r  thermodynamic  variables  like t h e  internal  energy  U a n d  entropy 
S in  te rms   of  p ,  v ,  and  T .  

However, p ,  v,  and  T  a r e  not  independent  variables.  If  t h e  gas  is  a  so-called  "ideal  gas" ,  
they   a r e  related  by  t h e  equation 

(n,R  cons tan ts ) .  
pv  =  nRT 
( I )  
To see wha t  complications th is  produces,  let's  consider first  a purely ma thema t ica l  example. 
E x a m p l e  1.  Let  w = x2  + y2 + z 2 ,  where  z  = x2 + y 2 .   Calculate - .

( a )   If  we  th ink   of  x  and  y  a s   t h e   independent  variables,  th en   we  can  calculate -ax  by 
two  different  methods: 
( i )   using  z  = x2  + Y 2   t o  get  rid  of  z ,  we  get 
w  =  x2 + y2 + (x2 + y2)2 
=  x2 + y2 + x4  + 2x2y2+ y4 ;  

( i i )   or  by  using  t h e  chain  rule, remembering z  is  a  function  of  x  a n d  y ,  
w  =  x 2 + y 2 + z 2  

so  t h e  two methods  agree. 

(b)  On  t h e   o the r   h and ,   if  we  th ink   of  x  and   z  a s  t h e   independent  variables,  using  say 
method  (i) above, we  get  rid  of  y  by  using  t h e  relation  y 2  = z - x 2 ,  a n d  get 
w  =  x2  + y2 + z2   =  z2+ (2 - x 2 )  + z 2  
=  Z  + z 2 ;

These  answers  a re  genuinely  different - we  cannot  convert  one  in to   t h e   other  by  using 
th e   relation  z  = x2 + y 2 .  Will  th e   right  d w l d x  please  s t a n d  up? 
T h e  answer is, t h a t  the re  is no one right answer, because t h e  problem was no t  well-stated. 
When  t h e  variables  a r e  n o t  independent, a n  expression  like d w l d x   does no t  have a  definite 
meaning. 

To  see why  th is   is  so, we  interpret  t h e   above example  geometrically.  Saying t h a t   x ,  y ,  z 
satisfy  t h e  relation  z  = x2  + y 2  means t h a t   t h e  point  (x, y ,  z )   lies  on  t h e  paraboloid  surface 
formed  by  ro ta t ing  z  = y2 abou t   t h e  z-axis.  T h e  function 
I  z 
I 

w  =  x2 + y 2   + z 2  

measures  t h e   square  of  t h e   distance  from  th e   origin.  To  be  defi- 
nite,  let's  suppose we  a r e   a t   t h e   s ta r t ing   point  P = Po  : ( 1 , 0 , 1 )  
indicated, and  we  want  t o  calculate  d w l d x  a t  th is   point. 

If  we  take   x  and   y  t o   be  t h e   independent  variables,  th en   t o   find 
Case  (a )  
d w l d x ,  we  hold  y  fixed  and   let  x  vary.  So P moves  in  t h e   xz-plane  towards  A ,  
along t h e  p a t h   shown. 

As  P moves  along  th is   p a t h ,   evidently  w,  t h e   squa re  of  i t s   distance  from  t h e  
dw
origin,  is  steadily  increasing:  - >  0  and   in  fact  t h e  calculations  for  ( a )   on

t h e  previous page  show  t h a t   - =  6.
d x  
Case  (b )   If  we  take   x  and   z  t o   be  th e   independent  variables,  th en   t o   find 
d w l d x ,  we  hold  z  fixed  and   let  x  vary.  Now  P moves  in  t h e   plane  a  = 1, along 
t h e  circular  p a th   towards  B. 

As  P moves  on  th is   p a th ,   t h e   square  of  i t s   distance  from  t h e   origin  is  not

changing, and  therefore  - = 0, 
a x  
To sum up ,   th e  value of  dw / d x   depends on which variables we  take   t o  be  independent, 
because  we  a r e   actually  measuring  different  ra tes   of  change,  a s   P  moves  along  different 
pa ths .  

The re  is only one way  ou t  of  our difficulty. When we  ask for d w l d x ,  we must  a t  t h e  same 
t ime  specify which variables a r e  t o  be taken  as t h e  independent ones.  Th is  is done by  using 
t h e  following notation: 
Case  ( a ) :   x ,  y  a r e  t h e  independent  variables:  (E) 
Case  ( b )  : x ,  z  a r e  t h e  independent variables:  (E) 
These a re  read,  " the  partial  of  w  with  respect  t o  x ,  with  y  (resp.  z )   held  cons tan t" .  

Note  how  in  each  case  t h e   two  lower  letters  give you  t h e   two  independent  variables.  If  we 
had  more  variables, we  would use  a  similar notation.  For  instance if 

(2 )  

w  =  f (2 ,  y ,  z ,  t ) ,  

where  xy  = z t ,  

then   only  three  of  t h e  variables x ,  y ,  z ,  t  can be  independent; t h e  fou r th  is  th en   determined

by  t h e  equation on  t h e  right  of  (2 ) .  Thu s  we  would  write expressions like

in  t h e  first, x ,  y ,  t  a r e  t h e  independent  variables; in  t h e  second, x ,  y ,  z  a r e  independent. 

"partial  of  w with  respect  t o  x ;  y  and   t  held  constant"; 

"partial  of  w with  respect  t o  y ;  x  a n d  z  held  cons tan t" ;  

2.  Differentials  vs.  Chain Rule 
An  alternative way  of  calculating pa r t ia l  derivatives uses to t a l  differentials.  We  illustrate 
with  an  example,  doing i t  first  with  t h e  chain  rule,  then   repeating  i t  using  differentials.  By 
definition, t h e  differential  of  a  function  of  several  variables, such a s  w = f (x ,  y ,  z )  is 

where  t h e   th ree   pa r t ia l   derivatives  f x ,   f,,  f,  a r e   t h e   formal pa r t ia l   derivatives,  i.e.,  t h e  
derivatives calculated as if  x ,  y ,  z  were  independent.

,  where  w = x3y - z 2 t   and  

xy  = z t .  

S o l u t i o n   1.  Using  t h e  chain  rule  and   t h e  two equations in  t h e  problem,  we  have 

S o l u t i o n  2 .   We  take  t h e  differentials  of  bo th  sides of  t h e  two equations in t h e  problem: 

Since t h e  problem  indicates t h a t  x ,  y ,  t  a r e  t h e  independent  variables, we  eliminate dz from 
t h e  equations  in  (4)  by  multiplying  t h e   second  equation  by  22,  adding  i t   t o   t h e   first,  then  
grouping  t h e  te rms ,  which  gives 

Comparing  th is  with  (3) - after  replacing  z  by  t  in  (3) - we  see t h a t  

(The   ac tua l   pa r t ia l   derivatives  a r e   t h e   same   as t h e   formal  pa r t ia l   derivatives  w,,  w,,  wt 
because  x ,  y, t  a r e  independent  variables.) 

Notice  t h a t   t h e  differential  method  here  takes  a  bit  more calculation, bu t   gives us  th ree  
derivatives, no t   just  one; th is   is  fine  if  you  want  all  th ree ,  bu t   a  l i t t le  wasteful  if  you  don't. 
T h e  main  th ing  t o  keep  in mind  for  t h e  method  is  t h a t  differentials  a r e  t r e a t ed  like vectors, 
with  t h e  dx, dy,  d z ,  . . .  playing  t h e  role  of  i ,  j , k , .  . . . T h a t   is:

1.  In  Example  2,  Solution  2,  we  used  t h e  operations  in  D l  t o  do   t h e   calculations.  We 
used  D2  in  t h e   last  s tep ,  taking  advantage of  t h e  fact  t h a t   t h e  x ,  y ,  t  were  independent. 
We  could have  done t h e  calculations using  D3  instead, by  solving t h e  second  equation in 
(4) for  dz  and   subs t i tu t ing  i t  into t h e  first  equation.  D3  is  a  consequence  of  t h e  chain  rule. 
Illustrations of  i t s  use  will  b e  given in  t h e  next  section. 

2.  T h e  main  advantage  of  calculating  with  differentials  is  t h a t   one  need  not  take   into 
account  whether  t h e   variables  a r e   dependent  or  no t ,   or  which  variables  depend  on  which 
o the rs ;  t h e  method  does  this  automatically for  you.  Examples will  i l lus t ra te .  

3.  If  t h e  variables a r e  no t   independent, D2 is emphatically  not t ru e ;  t h e  second  equation 
in  (4) gives  a  counterexample. 
Note  also  t h a t   in  D l ,  the re   is  no  a t t emp t   t o   include  a  "multiplication"  or  "division"  of 
differentials  t o   t h e   list  of  operations.  If  u  and   v  a r e   functions  of  several  variables,  then  
their  "product"  d u d v   makes  no  sense  a s   a  differential,  nor  does  the i r   "quotient"  d u l d v ,  
which  despite  appearances  is  not  in  general  related  t o  any  derivative,  or  function,  or  even 
defined.  (The re  is no elementary analogue of  t h e  dot and  cross product  of  vectors,  though  in 
advanced  differential  geometry  courses  a  certain  typ e  of  product  for  differentials  is  defined 
and  used  for  multiple  integration.) 
Let  w  =  x 2  - yz  + t 2 ,   where  x ,  y ,  z ,  t  satisfy  t h e   two  equations 
xy  = z t .  
and  
z 2 = x + y  
Using  these  equations,  we  can  express  first  z  and   then   t  in  te rms   of  x  and   y ;   th is   means 
t h a t   w  can  also  be  expressed  in  te rms   of  x  and   y.  W i thou t   actually  calculating  w (x ,  y) 
explicitly,  find  i t s  gradient  vector  Vw (x ,  y) . 

E x a m p l e   3. 

S o l u t i o n .   Since  we  need  bo th   pa r t ia l   derivatives  (dw ldx ) ,   and   ( dw l d y ) , ,   i t   makes 
sense t o  use  t h e   differential  method.  Taking  t h e   differential  of  w  and   of  t h e  two  equations 
connecting  t h e  variables gives  us 
( 6 )   dw  = 2xdx - zdy - ydz + 2 td t ,  
We want  x  and  y t o  be t h e  independent variables;  using t h e  operations in  D l ,  first  eliminate 
d t  by  solving for i t  in t h e  second equation, and  subs t i tu t ing  for i t  in to  t h e  first equation; then  
eliminate dz  by  solving  for  i t   in  t h e   last  equation  and   subs t i tu t ing   in to   t h e  first  equation; 
t h e  result  is 

xdy + ydx = zd t  + tdz ,  

2zdz = dx + 2ydy. 

Since x  and  y  a r e  independent, comparing  t h e  two expressions  for  dw  in  (7) and   (3)  (using 
x  and  y ) ,  and  then   using  D2, shows t h a t  t h e  two coefficients in  (7) a r e  respectively t h e  two 
pa r t ia l   derivatives w,  and  w,,  i.e., t h e  two  components of  t h e  gradient  Vw.

Example  4.  Suppose  th e  variables  x ,  y, z  satisfy  a n  equation  g (x ,  y ,  z )  = 0.  Assume 
th e  point  P : ( 1 , 1 , 1 )  lies on  t h e  surface  g = 0  and   t h a t   (V g ) p  = ( -1 ,1 ,2 ) .  
Let  f (x ,  y, z )   be  another  function,  and   assume  t h a t   (Vf ) p  = ( 1 , 2 , 1 ) .  
F ind   t h e  gradient  of  th e  function w = f (x ,  y ,  z ( x ,  y ) )  of  t h e  two  independent  variables x 
and  y,  a t  t h e  point  x = 1, y = 1. 

Solution.  Using  differentials,  we  have,  by  (3)  and  our  hypotheses, 
(dg )p  = -dx  + dy + 2dz = 0, 
(dw )p  = dx + 2dy + dz; 
eliminating  dz  by  solving  t h e   second  equation  for  i t   and   subs t i tu t ing   in to   t h e   first,  or  by 
dividing t h e  second  equation by  2  and  substracting  i t   from  t h e  first, we  get 

since  dg = 0  for  all x ,  y, z ;  

3.  Abstract  partial differentiation; rules relating partial derivatives 
Often  in   applications, t h e   function  w  is  not  given  explicitly,  nor  a re   t h e   equations  con-
necting  t h e  variables.  Thus   you  need  t o  be  able  t o  work  with  functions  and   equations just 
given abstractly.  T h e  previous  ideas work  perfectly well, as we  will  i l lus t ra te .   However, we 
will  need  (as in  section  2)  t o  distinguish  between 
formal pa r t ia l   derivatives, w r i t ten  here  f x ,   f y ,  . . .  (calculated  as if  all t h e  variables were 
independent), and  
actual pa r t ia l  derivatives, w r i t ten  af / a x , .  . . , which take account of  any  relations between 
th e  variables. 

Example  5 .   If

while  three  of  t h e  many possible  ac tua l  pa r t ia l  derivatives a re   (we use  t h e  chain  rule) 

Rules  connecting partial derivatives.  These  rules a r e  widely  used  i n  t h e  applications, 
especially  in  thermodynamics.  Here we  will use  them   as a n  excuse  for fu r the r  practice with 
th e   chain  rule  and  differentials. 
W i th   a n   eye  t o   thermodynamics, we  assume  a  set  of  variables  t ,  v ,v ,  w, x ,  y ,  z ,  . . .  con-
nected  by  several equations in  such  a  way  t h a t  
any  two  are  independent; 
any  three a re  connected by  a n  equation. 
Thus ,   one  can  choose  any  two  of  them   t o   be  th e   independent  variables,  a n d   th en   each  of 
th e  o the r  variables can be  expressed  in  te rms  of  these  two.

We  give  each  rule  in  two  forms-the 
second  form  is  t h e   one  ordinarily  used,  while  t h e  
first  is  easier  t o  remember.  (Th e  first  two  rules  a r e  fairly  simple in  either  form.)

Note  how  t h e  successive factors in  th e  cyclic  rule  a r e  formed:  th e  variables  a r e  used  in  t h e  
successive orders  x ,  y ,  z;  y ,  z ,  x;  z ,  x ,  y ;   one  says  they   a r e  permuted  cyclically, and   th is  
explains t h e  name.

Proof of  the rules.  T h e  first  two rules  a r e  simple:  since z  is being held  fixed th roughou t ,  
each variable  becomes  a  function  of  just  one other  variable,  and   (9) is just  t h e  one-variable 
chain  rule.  Then   (8)  is just  t h e  special case of  (9) where  x  = t .  

The  cyclic rule  is  less obvious - on t h e  right  side i t  looks almost  like t h e  chain rule, bu t  
different variables  a r e  being held  constant  in each of  t h e  differentiations, and  th is  changes i t  
entirely.  To prove  i t ,  we  suppose  f (x, y ,  z )  = 0 is  t h e  equation satisfied  by  x ,  y, z ;  tak ing  y 
and  z  as t h e  independent  variables and  differentiating  f ( a ,  y ,  z )  = 0 with  respect  t o  y gives:

Permuting  t h e  variables  in  (11) and  multiplying  t h e  resulting  th ree   equations gives  (10a):

therefore

terms  of  formal  pa r t ia l  derivatives  of  w  a n d  r .  

Solution.  Evidently  t h e   independent  variables  a re   t o  be  r  and   8 ,   since  these  a re   t h e  
ones t h a t  occur  in t h e  lower p a r t  of  t h e  partial  derivative, with x  dependent  on  them .   Since 
8 is  viewed  as a  cons tan t ,  t h e  chain  rule  gives 

by  th e  reciprocal rule  (8 ) .  and  therefore  finally,

4.  Changing  the  independent  variables.*  For  those  of  you  who  will  s tudy  
thermodynamics,  a  ma jo r   use  of  t h e   rules  of  t h e   preceding  section  is  t o   change  physical 
laws expressed in t e rm s  of  one pair  of  independent  variables t o  ano the r  pair  which  is be t te r  
adap ted   t o  t h e  particular  problem  a t  hand .  

In thermodynamics, some of  t h e  variables  associated with a  confined gas a r e  p (pressure), 
V  (volume),  T  ( tempe ra tu re ) ,   U  (internal energy),  S (entropy), a n d   H  (enthalpy).  Any 
two  a r e  independent,  and  the i r   values  then   determine all  t h e  others. 
To  avoid  confusion,  i t   is  be t te r   t o   s t a t e  our  general  problem  in  te rms   of  a  neu t ra l   list 
derivative  (g) is given, where  t h e  A, B ,  C  a r e  th ree  of  these variables,  and  we  want  t o  
of  variables - we  will  use  u ,  v, w, x ,  y.  Then   we  can  s t a t e  t h e  problem  th is   way:  a  pa r t ia l  
use  x  and   y  as  t h e   new  independent  variables;  i.e.,  we  want  t o   express  (g)cin  terms 
C 
of  pa r t ia l   derivatives  t h a t   look  like  (g) and   (g)where  r  s t and s   for  any  of  t h e

variables. 

I t  looks like the re  will be many  cases, bu t   outside of  t h e  trivial ones, t h e  most  commonly 
occurring  ones  a r e  all  handled  by  t h e  rules  of  t h e  previous  section. 
T h e  trivial  cases  a r e  when  two  of  A, B ,  C a r e  equal: 

A  = B; 
A = C; 
undefined,  B = C. 

Two more  "trivial"  cases  a r e  when  B  and  C  a r e  x  and  y,  in  either  order,  since  then   t h e  
pa r t ia l   derivative is  already  in  th e  desired  form. 

T h e  rest  of  th e  cases  a r e  non-trivial, bu t   a r e  covered by  t h e  rules.  Remembering  t h a t   x 
and  y  a r e  t o  b e  t h e  new  variables, t h e  commonly  occurring  cases  a r e  these  two: 
(8 )=  ( a s j a y ) . ,  
(aA'ay)x 

(chain rule  (9)) 

In  th e  above, x  a n d  y  can  be  interchanged;  A, B ,  C  s t a n d  for any  variables;  u ,  v, w  a r e  any  
variables  o the r   than   x  o r  y.  The  reciprocal  rule  can  be  used  a s  a preliminary s t ep   to  p u t   a 
given p a r t i a l  derivative in to  one of  th e  above forms. 

Example  7.  One of  t h e   laws of  thermodynamics is  expressed  by  t h e  equation 

Wh a t   is  t h e  equation  for  th is   law when  V  and  T a r e  t h e  independent  variables?

Solution.  Looking  a t  each  derivative  in   t u r n ,   t h e   first  has   t h e   form  (13)  and   needs  t h e  
chain  rule;  t h e  second  has  t h e   form  (14)  and  needs  t h e  cyclic  rule;  t h e   last  needs  only  t h e  
reciprocal  rule.  Using  these,  t h e  equation  is  transformed  in to  

T h e  subscripts a r e  unnecessary,  if  i t  is known  t h a t  T and  V  a r e  t h e   independent  variables; 
however  the re  is no h a rm  in  including them  and  removing  t h e  common denominator, which 
(E),-
T  (2);  P  =  0

5 .   Additional rules.*  For t h e  sake of  completeness, we  add  two more rules which will 
enable  you  to  make even  uncommon  selections  of  independent  variables. 

To  s t a t e  these  last  two  rules,  we  need  a  determinant  called  t h e   Jacobian.  We  give  t h e  
no ta t ion   and  definition  for  two  functions u ( x ,  y)  a n d  v (x ,  y ) :

two-Jacobian  rule 

We  leave t h e  proof  of  t h e  Jacobian rule  (16b) a s  a good exercise in t h e  use of  differentials; 
t h e  form  (16a) follows from  i t  by  applying  t h e  chain  rule  (9b) a n d  t h e  definition  (15). 

T h e   two-Jacobian  rule  can  be  proved  directly  either  with  differentials  or  t h e   s t and a rd  
chain  rule  for  functions  of  several variables.  I t  is  t h e  mother  of  all rules:  t h e  o the r  four  can 
be  derived  from  i t  by  making  some of  th e  variables  equal t o  each other. 

As  in   section 4,  these new  rules  allow  t h e  remaining  choices of  independent  variable:
