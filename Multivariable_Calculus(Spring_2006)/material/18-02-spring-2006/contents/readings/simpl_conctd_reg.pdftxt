V5.  Simply-Connected Regions 

1.  The  Extended  Green's Theorem. 
In  t h e   work  on  Green's theorem  so  fa r ,   it  has   been  assumed  t h a t   t h e   region  R  has  as 
i t s   boundary  a  single  simple  closed  curve.  Bu t   th is   isn't  necessary.  Suppose  t h e   region 
has  a  boundary  composed  of  several  simple  closed  curves, like  t h e  
ones  pictured.  We  suppose  these  boundary  curves  C 1 , .  . . , C,  all 
lie within  t h e  domain where F is  continuously  differentiable.  Most 
importantly,  all  t h e  curves must  be  directed  so t h a t   t h e  normal  n 
points  away from  R. 

Extended  Green's  Theorem  With  th e  curve orientations a s  shown, 

In  other  words,  Green's theorem  also  applies t o  regions  with  several bounda ry   curves, pro-
vided  t h a t   we  take   t h e   line  integral  over  t h e   complete  boundary,  with  each  p a r t   of  t h e  
boundary  oriented so  t h e  normal  n points  outside R. 
Proof.  We  use  subdivision;  t h e   idea  is  adequately  conveyed  by  a n   exam-
ple.  Consider  a  region  with  th ree   boundary  curves  as  shown.  T h e   th r e e   cu ts  
illustrated  divide  up  R  in to   two  regions  R1 and   R 2 ,  each  bounded  by  a  single 
simple  closed  curve,  and   Green's  theorem  in  t h e   usual  form  can  be  applied  t o  
f  F  dr  = u,curl F dA  h2F . dr  =  IS,,curl F dA 
each piece.  Letting B1  and  B2  be t h e  boundary  curves shown, we  have therefore 
B1 
Add  these  two  equations  together.  Th e   right  sides  add   up   t o   t h e   right  side  of 
(1 ) .   T h e  left  sides  add   up  t o  t h e   left  side  of  (1)  (for m  = 2 ) ,  since  over  each  of 
t h e   th ree   cu ts ,   the re   a r e  two  line  integrals  taken  in  opposite  directions, which 
therefore  cancel  each  other  ou t .

2 .   Simply-connected and  multiply-connected regions. 
Though  Green's  theorem  is  still  valid  for  a  region  with  "holes"  like  t h e   ones  we  just 
considered, t h e  relation  curl F = 0  + F = V f  is  no t .   T h e  reason  for  th is   is  a s  follows. 
curl  F  =  0  + 
We  a r e   t ry ing   t o   show  t h a t  
for  any  closed  curve  lying  in  R.  We  expect  t o   be  able  t o   use  Green's 
theorem.  Bu t   if  t h e  region  has  a  hole,  like t h e  one pictured,  we  canno t   ap -
ply  Green's theorem t o  t h e  curve C  because t h e  interior  of  C  is no t   entirely 
.  contained  in  R. 
To  see wha t   a  delicate  affair  th is   is,  consider  t h e  earlier  Example  2  in   Section V2.  T h e  
field G  the re   satisfies  curl G  = 0  everywhere  bu t   t h e  origin.  T h e  region  R  is  t h e  xy-plane 
with  (0,O) removed.  Bu t   G  is  not  a  gradient  field, because  fc G . dr  #  0  a round   a  circle 
C  surrounding t h e  origin. 

,,.,-. 

Th is   is  clearer  if  we  use  Green's  theorem  in  normal  form  (Section  V4).  If 
t h e   flow  field  satisfies  div  F  = 0  everywhere  except  a t   one  po in t ,   t h a t   doesn't

guarantee  t h a t   t h e   flux  through  every  closed curve will  be  0.  For  t h e  spo t  where 
div  F is  undefined  might  be  a  source,  through  which  fluid  is  being  added  t o  t h e  
flow. 
In  order  t o   be  able  t o  prove  under  reasonable  hypotheses  t h a t   curl F = 0  + F = V f ,  
we  define our  troubles  away by  assuming  t h a t   R  is  t h e   so r t  of  region  where  t h e   difficulties 
described  above cannot  occur-i.e.,  we  assume  t h a t  R  has  no holes;  such  regions  a r e  called 
simply-connected. 
Definition.  A two-dimensional  region D  of  t h e  plane  consisting of  one connected  piece 
is  called  simply-connected  if  i t   has   this  property:  whenever  a  simple  closed  curve  C lies 
entirely  in  D ,  then   i t s  interior  also lies  entirely  in  D .  
As  examples:  t h e  xy-plane, t h e  right-half plane where  x  2 0, and  t h e  un i t   circle with i t s  
interior  a re  all  simply-connected  regions.  Bu t   t h e  xy-plane  minus  t h e  origin  is  no t   simply- 
connected,  since  any  circle  surrounding t h e  origin  lies in  D ,  yet  i t s  interior does no t .  

As  indicated, one can think of  a simply-connected region a s  one without  "holes".  Regions 
with  holes  a r e  said  t o  be  multiply-connected, or  not  simply-connected. 
Theorem.  Let  F  = M i  + N j   be  continuously  differentiable  in  a  simply-connected 
region  D  of  th e  xy-plane.  Then   in  D ,  
curl  F = 0  +  F = V f ,  

in  te rms  of  components,

for  some f (x, y ) ;  

Proof.  Since  a  field  is  a  gradient field  if  i t s  line  integral around  any  closed  p a th   is 0, i t  
suffices t o  show 
curl F = 0  + 

for  every  closed  curve C in D .  

F . dr  = 0 

We  prove  (4)  in  two  steps. 

Assume first t h a t  C is a simple closed curve; let R be i t s  interior.  Th en  since D is simply- 
connected, R will  lie entirely  inside D .   Therefore F will be continuously differentiable in R ,  
and  we  can use  Green's  theorem: 

Next  consider  t h e  general case, where  C is closed bu t   no t   simple--i.e.,  i t   intersects  itself. 
Then  C can  be  broken  in to  smaller  simple closed  curves for which  t h e  above argument will 
be  valid.  A  formal  argument  would  be  awkward  t o   give,  bu t   t h e   examples  illustrate.  In 
bo th   cases,  t h e  p a t h  s t a r t s  and  ends a t  P, and  

k ~ . d ~ = L ~ ~ . d ~ + k ~ . d ~ + L ~ ~ . d r
In  bo th  cases, C2 is a  simple closed p a th ,  and  also Cl +C3 is a simple closed 
pa th .   Since D  is  simply-connected, t h e  interiors  automatically  lie  in  D ,  so 
t h a t  by  t h e  first  p a r t   of  t h e  a rgumen t ,

Adding  these  up ,  we  get 

T h e  above argument  works  if  C intersects  itself  a  finite number  of  times.  If  C intersects 
itself  infinitely  often, we  would  have  t o  resort  t o  approximations t o  C; we  skip  th is   case. 

We  pause now  t o  summarize  compactly  t h e  central result,  bo th   in  t h e  language of  vector 
fields and   in  t h e  equivalent language  of  differentials. 

Curl  Theorem.  Let  F  = M i   + N j  be  a  continuously  differentiable  vector  field 
in   a  simply-connected  region  D  of  t h e   xy-plane.  Th en   t h e   following  four  s ta temen ts   a r e  
equivalent - if  any one is  t r u e  for  F in D ,  so a r e  t h e  other  three: 
1 .   [F - d r  is  path-independent 
1.'  J 6 )  M dx + N dy  is  path-independent 
for  any  two  points P,Q  in D ;  

3.  F = V f 
for  some  f  in  D 
4.  curl F = 0 
in D 

for  any  simple  closed  curve C lying  in D ;  
3 .'   M dx + N dy  = df 
4.'  My = N ,  
in  D. 

for  some  f  in  D 

Remarks.  We  summarize  below  what  still  holds  t r u e   even  if  one  or  more  of  t h e  
hypotheses  doesn't  hold:  D  is  no t   simply-connected,  or  t h e   field  F  is  no t   differentiable 
everywhere in  D .  

1.  S ta temen ts   1 ,  2,  and   3  a re   equivalent  even  if  F  is  only  continuous;  D  need  no t   b e  
simply-connected.. 
2 .   S ta temen ts   1, 2,  and   3  each  implies  4 ,   if  if  F  is  continuously  differentiable; D  need 
no t   b e  simply-connected.  (Bu t  4  implies  1 ,  2,  3 only  if  D  is  simply-connected.) 

Example  1.  Is  F = xy i  + x2j  a  gradient field? 
Solution.  We  have  curl F = x  # 0,  so t h e  theorem  says i t   is  no t .  

ydx  - xdy
Example 2 .   Is 
an  exact differential?  If  so, find all possible  functions  f (x ,  y)
y2
for which  i t   can be  written  df  . 
Solution.  M = l l y  and   N  = -z ly2   a r e   continuously  differentiable  wherever  y  # 0 ,  
i.e.,  in   t h e   two  half-planes  above  and   below  t h e   x-axis.  These  a r e  bo th   simply-connected. 
In  each  of  them ,  

My = -llY2= N ,  
Thus  in each half-plane t h e  differential is exac t ,  by t h e  theorem, and  we  can calculate  f (x, y) 
by  th e  s t and a rd  methods  in  Sction V2.  They  give

where  c  is  an   a rb i t r a ry  cons tan t .   This  constant  need  no t   be   t h e  same  for  t h e   two  regions, 
since they   do no t   touch.  Thus   t h e  most  general function  is

Y  > 0

Example  3.  Let  F = r n ( x i  + y j ) ,   r = d
R . For  which  integers  n  is  F conserva-
tive?  For  each  such, find  a  corresponding  f (x ,  y)  such  t h a t   F = V f  . 
Solution.  By  t h e  usual  calculation, using  t h e  chain  rule  a n d  t h e  useful  polar  coordinate 
relations  r,  = x l r ,   ry  = y / r ,   we  find  t h a t   curl F = 0.  The re   a r e  two  cases. 
Case  1:  n  > 0.  Then   F is  continuously  differentiable  in  t h e  whole  xy-plane,  which  is 
simply-connected.  Thus   by  t h e  preceding  theorem, F is  conservative,  a n d  we  can  calculate 
f (x ,  y)  a s  in  Section V2. 
We  use me thod  1 (line integration).  Th e  radial  symmetry  suggests using  t h e  ray  C from 
(0,O)  t o   ( X I ,  y l )   a s  th e  p a t h  of  integration, with  t h e  pa rame t r iza t ion  

also,  let 

x  = x l t ,   y = y l t ,   0 5 t  5 1; 
r ~ = d G ;then  
and  we  g e t ,  by  method  1 for  finding  f (x ,  y ) ,  

r n = r ; t n ,  

~ d x + ~ d y = r ~ t d t  

so t h a t  

(7) 

rn+2 
f ( z , y )   =  n+2, 

F  =  V f ,   n 2 O .  

Case  2:  n  < 0.  T h e   field  F is  not  defined  a t   (0, O),  so  t h a t   i t s   domain,  t h e  xy-plane 
with  (0,O) removed,  is  no t   simply-connected.  So even  though   curl  F = 0 in  th is   region,  (3) 
is  not  immediately  applicable. 
Nonetheless, if  n  # -2,  one  can  check by  differentiation  t h a t   (7) is  still  valid. 
If  n = -2,  guessing,  inspection,  or method  2 give  f (x ,  y)  = l n r .  

We  conclude  t h a t   t h e  field in all cases is  a gradient  field.  Note  in  pa r t icu la r   t h a t   t h e  two 
force fields given in  section V1, representing  respectively  ( ap a r t  from a  cons tan t  factor) t h e  
fields arising from a positive  charge a t   (0,O) and  a  uniform positive  charge along t h e  z-axis, 
correspond t o  t h e  respective  cases n  = -3  and  n  = -2,  and   a r e  bo th   gradient  fields:
