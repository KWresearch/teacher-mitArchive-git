V4.  Green's Theorem in Normal Form 

1.  Green's theorem  for  flux. 
Let F = M  i + N j represent  a two-dimensional  flow field, and  C a simple 
closed curve, positively  oriented, with  interior  R. 

According  t o  t h e  previous  section, 

(1) 

flux  of  F  across C  = 

Notice  t h a t  since t h e  normal vector  points outwards, away from R ,  t h e  flux is positive where 
t h e  flow  is  ou t  of  R ;  flow  in to  R  counts  a s  negative  flux. 

We  now  apply  Green's theorem  t o   t h e   line  integral in  (1 ) ;  first  we  w r i te   t h e   integral  in 
s t and a rd  form  (dx first, th en   dy): 

This  gives  us  Green's theorem  in the   normal  form 

Mathematically th is  is t h e  same theorem a s  t h e  tangential form of  Green's theorem - all 
we  have  done is  t o  juggle  t h e  symbols M  and  N  a round ,  changing t h e   sign  of  one  of  them .  
Wh a t   is different  is t h e  physical  interpretation.  Th e  left  side represents  t h e  flux of  F across 
t h e  closed curve C.  Wh a t   does t h e   right  side  represent? 

2 .   The  two-dimensional  divergence. 
Once  again,  let  F = M i  + N j . We  give a  name  t o  and   a  no ta t ion   for 
t h e  integrand  of  t h e  double integral on  t h e  right  of  (2): 

d N
d M  
div  F  =  -+ -, 
d x  
dy 

t h e  divergence of  F  . 

Evidently div F is a  scalar function of  two variables.  To get a t  i t s  physical  meaning,  look 
a t  t h e  small rectangle pictured.  If  F is continuously  differentiable,  th en  div F is a continuous 
function,  which  is  therefore  approximately  constant  if  t h e   rectangle  is  small  enough.  We 
apply  (2)  t o   t h e   rectangle;  t h e   double  integral  is  approximated  by  a  p roduc t ,   since  t h e  
integrand  is  approximately  constant: 
(E  Y)  

flux across sides  of  rectangle  z  -+ --- AA   , 
Because  of  t h e  importance  of  th is  approximate relation, we  give a more direct  derivation 
of  i t   which  doesn't  use  Green's  theorem.  T h e   reasoning  which  follows  is  widely  used  in 
mathematical  modeling  of  physical  problems. 

AA   =  a rea  of  rectangle.

Continuing  our  search  for  a  physical  meaning  for  t h e  divergence,  if  t h e   to t a l   flux  over  t h e  
sides  of  t h e  small  rectangle  is  positive,  th is  means  the re   is  a  net  flow  o u t  of  t h e   rectangle. 
According  t o   conservation  of  m a t t e r ,   t h e   only  way  this  can  happen  is  if  the re   is  a  s o u r c e  
adding fluid directly to  t h e  rectangle.  If  t h e  flow is taking place  in  a  shallow t ank  of  uniform 
d ep th ,   such  a  source  can  be  visualized  a s   someone  standing  over  t h e   t ank ,   pouring  fluid 
directly  in to   th e   rectangle.  Similarly,  a  net  flow  i n t o  t h e   rectangle  implies  the re   is  a  s i n k  
withdrawing fluid from t h e  rectangle.  I t  is best  t o  think of  such a sink a s  a  "negative source". 
T h e  ne t   r a t e   (positive  or  negative)  a t  which  fluid  is  added  directly  t o  t h e   rectangle  from 
above may  be  called  t h e   "source  rate"  for  t h e  rectangle.  Thus ,  since m a t t e r   is  conserved, 

flux over sides of  rectangle  = 

source  r a t e  for  t h e   rectangle; 

combining  th is  with  (4) shows t h a t  

source r a t e  for  th e  rectangle  z

We  now  divide  by  AA  and  pass  t o   t h e  limit, getting  by  definition 
t h e  source r a t e   a t   (x ,  y)  =  (  + ) 
=  div  F 
The  definition  of  t h e  double  integral a s  t h e  limit  of  a  sum shows  in  t h e  usual way  now  t h a t  
source r a t e  for R  =  /Ldiv  F d~  . 
These two relations  (6) and   (7) interpret  t h e  divergence physically,  for a  flow field, and  they 
interpret  also Green's  theorem in  t h e  normal form: 

to t a l  flux  across  C  =  source r a t e  for R

Since  Green's  theorem  is  a  ma thema t ica l   theorem,  one  might  think  we  have 
"proved"  t h e   law  of  conservation  of  m a t t e r .   This  is  no t   so,  since  th is   law  was 
needed  for  our  interpretation  of  div  F a s  t h e  source r a t e   a t   (x ,  y ) .  

We  give  side-by-side  t h e   two  forms  of  Green's theorem,  first  in  t h e   vector  form, then   in 
th e  differential  form  used  when  calculations  a r e  t o  be  done.

3.  An  interpretation  for  curl  F. 
T h e  function  curl F can be  thought  of  a s  measuring  t h e  ro ta t iona l  tendency of  t h e  vector 
/ ( x ~ ~ ~ d  (s
field:  either  a s   a  force  field  or  a  velocity  field,  F will  make  a  tes t   object  placed  a t   a  point 
Po spin  abou t   a  vertical  axis  (i.e., one  in  t h e   k -direction), and   t h e   angular  velocity  of  t h e  
spin will  be  proportional  t o   (curl F)O. 
To  see th is   for  t h e   velocity  field  v  of  a  flowing 
liquid, place a paddle wheel of  radius a so i ts  center 
is  a t   (xo ,  y o ) ,  and  i ts   axis  is  vertical.  We  ask  how 
rapidly  t h e  flow  spins th e  wheel.) 
If  t h e  wheel had  only  one blade,  t h e  velocity  of 
6(+,yo)
t h e  blade would be F . t ,  t h e  component of  t h e  flow 
I 
velocity  vector  F perpendicular  to   t h e  blade,  i.e.,

paddlewheel

Since  F . t  is  no t   constant  along  th is   circle,  if  t h e   wheel  had   only  one  blade  i t   would 
spin  around  a t   a n  uneven  r a t e .   Bu t   if  t h e  wheel  has many  blades,  th is   unevenness  will  be 
averaged  ou t ,   and   i t   will  spin  around  a t  approximately th e   average value of  t h e   tangential 
velocity  F . t  over  th e   circle.  Like  t h e   average value  of  any  function  defined  along  a  curve, 
this average tangential velocity can be found by  integrating F . t  over t h e  circle, and  dividing 
by  t h e   length of  t h e  circle.  Thus ,  
1  h F . d r  
F - t d s   = 
speed of  blade  = 
-- & / L ( c u r l   F )o  dx dy, 
by  Green's theo rem ,  

where  (curl  F ) o  is  t h e   value  of  t h e   function  curl  F  a t   (xo ,  y o )   T h e  justification  for  t h e  
last  approximation  is  t h a t   if  t h e   circle  formed  by  t h e   paddlewheel  is  small,  th en   curl  F 
has  approximately  t h e  value  (curl F ) o  over  t h e   interior  R  of  t h e  circle,  so t h a t  multiplying 
this  constant  value  by  th e  a rea  n u 2  of  R  should give approximately t h e  value  of  t h e  double 
integral.

From  (8) we  get  for  t h e  tangential  speed of  t h e  paddlewheel: 

a
tangential  speed  z  - (curl F ) o  .

We  can  get  rid  of  th e   a  by  using  t h e   angular  velocity  wo  of  t h e   paddlewheel;  since  t h e  
tangential  speed  is  awo , (9) becomes 

1 
wo  z  - (curl F ) o  .

As  t h e  radius  of  t h e  paddlewheel  gets smaller, t h e  approximation becomes  more exact,  and  
passing  t o  t h e   limit  a s  a  + 0, we  conclude  t h a t ,  for  a  two-dimensional  velocity  field  F, 
I  curl F = twice  the  angular  velocity of an  infinitesimal paddlewheel  a t   (x ,  y)  . I 

(11) 

T h e  curl thus  measures  t h e   "vorticity"  of  t h e  fluid flow - i ts  tendency  t o  produce ro ta t ion .  

A  consideration  of  curl F for  a  force field would  be  similar,  interpreting  F as  exerting a 
to rque  on  a  spinnable object - a  little  dumbbell  with  two  unit  masses  for  a  gravitational 
field, or with  two  unit  positive  charges  for  a n  electrostatic force field.

Example 1.  Calculate and  in te rp re t   curl  F for 
Solution.  (a) curl F = 0; th is  makes sense since t h e  field is radially outward and  radially 
symmetric, the re   is  no  favored  angular  direction  in  which  t h e  paddlewheel  could  spin. 

(b )  curl F = 2w  a t  every point.  Since th is  field represents a fluid ro ta t ing  abou t  t h e  origin 
with  constant  angular  velocity  w  (see section V l ) ,  i t  is  a t  least  clear  t h a t   curl F should  be 
2w  a t  t h e  origin;  it's no t   so clear  t h a t   i t   should  have  th is   same value  everywhere, bu t   i t   is 
t rue .
