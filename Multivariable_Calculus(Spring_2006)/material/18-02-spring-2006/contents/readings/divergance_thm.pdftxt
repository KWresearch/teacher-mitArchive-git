V10.  The Divergence Theorem 

1.  Introduction; statement  of  the  theorem. 
Th e  divergence  theorem  is abou t   closed surfaces, so let's s t a r t  the re .   By  a  closed surface 
S we will mean  a surface consisting of  one connected piece which doesn't intersect itself, and  
which  completely  encloses  a  single  finite  region  D  of  space  called  i ts   interior.  T h e   closed 
surface S is  then   said  t o   be  t h e   boundary  of  D ;  we  include  S in  D.  A  sphere,  cube,  and  
torus  (an  inflated bicycle inner tub e )  a r e  all examples of  closed surfaces.  On  t h e  o the r  hand ,  
these  a r e   not  closed  surfaces:  a  plane,  a  sphere with  one  point  removed,  a  t in   can  whose 
cross-section  looks  like a  figure-8  ( i t  intersects  itself),  a n  infinite  cylinder.

A  closed  surface  always  has  two  sides,  and   i t   has  a  n a tu r a l   positive 
direction - t h e  one for  which  n points  away  from  t h e  interior, i.e.,  points 
toward  t h e  outside.  We  shall always understand  t h a t  t h e  closed surface has 
been  oriented  this  way, unless  otherwise specified. 

We  now  generalize  t o  3-space t h e  normal  form  of  Green's  theorem  (Section V4). 
Definition.  Let  F ( x ,  y ,  z )  = M i   + N j  + P k  be  a  vector  field  differentiable in  some 
region  D.  By  t h e   divergence of  F we  mean  t h e   scalar  function  div  F  of  th r e e   variables 
defined in D  by 

The  divergence  theorem.  Let  S be  a positively-oriented  closed surface with  interior 
D,  a n d  l e t  F  be a  vector field continuously differentiable  in  a  domain  con ta t in ing  D.  Then 

We  write  dV  on   t h e   right  side,  ra the r   t h a n   dxdy  dz  since  t h e   t r ip le   integral  is 
often  calculated  in  o the r   coordinate  systems, particularly  spherical  coordinates. 
T h e  theorem  is  sometimes called  Gauss'  theorem. 

Physically,  t h e   divergence  theorem  is  interpreted  just  like  t h e   normal  form  for  Green's 
theorem.  Th ink  of  F as a  three-dimensional flow field.  Look first  a t  t h e  left  side of  (2).  Th e  
surface integral represents t h e  mass t ranspo r t   r a t e  across t h e  closed surface S ,  with flow ou t  
of  S considered  as  positive,  flow  in to  S a s  negative. 

Look  now  a t   t h e  right  side of  (2).  In  wha t   follows, we  will  show  t h a t   t h e   value  of  div  F 
a t   (x, y ,  z )  can be  interpreted  a s  t h e  source  ra te  a t   (x ,  y, z ) :  t h e  r a t e  a t  which  fluid  is being 
added t o  t h e  flow  a t  this  point.  (Negative r a t e  means fluid  is  being  removed  from t h e  flow.) 
Th e  integral on t h e  right of  (2) thus  represents t h e  source rate fo r  D.  So wha t  t h e  divergence 
theorem  says  is: 

(3) 

Aux  across S = source r a t e  for D ; 

i.e.,  t h e  net  flow outward  across S is  t h e  same a s  t h e  r a t e  a t  which  fluid  is  being  produced 
(or added  t o  t h e  flow)  inside  S .

To  complete t h e  argument  for  (3) we  still  have  t o  show  t h a t  

div  F  =  source r a t e  a t  (x, y ,  z )   .

Consider  a  l i t t le   rectangular  box, with  edges  Ax ,  Ay ,  A z  parallel  t o   t h e   coordi- 
n a t e   axes,  and   one  corner  a t   Po .   We  take   n  t o   be  always  pointing  outwards,  a s  
usual; thus   on  t o p  of  t h e  box  n = k ,   bu t   on  t h e  bo t tom   face,  n = - k .  
T h e  flux  across t h e  top   face  in  t h e  n direction  is  approximately 
F (xo ,  yo, zo  + Az)  . k  AxAy   =  P ( x o ,  yo, zo  + Az )   A xA y ,

while  t h e  flux  across t h e  bo t tom   face  in  t h e  n  direction  is  approximately 

F (x0 ,  Y o ,  zo)  . - k  AXAY  =  -P (xo ,   Yo, zo)  AXAY  . 

[P (xo ,  YO ,  zo + A z )  - ~ ( x o ,  ZO ) ]  AxAy   =

So t h e  ne t   flux  across t h e  two  faces  combined  is  approximately

Since  t h e   difference  quotient  is  approximately  equal  t o   t h e   pa r t ia l   derivative,  we  get  t h e  
first  line  below; t h e  reasoning for  t h e  following two  lines  is  analogous: 
n e t  Aux  across  top  and   bottom  =  (')o ~ x ~ y ~ z ;

Adding  up   these  th ree  net  fluxes, and  using  (3 ) ,  we  see t h a t

Using  this, we  get  t h e  in te rp re ta t ion  for  div F we  a r e  seeking:

On  t h e  other  side,  div  F = 3,

Example  2 .   Use  t h e  divergence  theorem  t o  evaluate t h e  flux  of  F = x3  i  + y 3 j  + z3 k 
across t h e  sphere p = a. 
Solution.  Here  div  F = 3 (x2  + y2 + z 2 )  = 3p2 . Therefore  by  (2 ) ,  

we  did  t h e  triple  integration  by  dividing up  t h e  sphere in to  th in   concentric  spheres, having 
volume  dV = 47rp2 dp. 

Example  3.  Let  S1 be  t h a t   portion  of  t h e   surface  of  t h e   paraboloid  z  = 1- x 2  - y 2  
lying  above t h e  xy-plane,  and  let S2be  t h e  p a r t   of  t h e  xy-plane lying  inside t h e  unit  circle, 
directed  so t h e  normal  n points upwards.  Take F = yz i  + x z  j  + xy k ; evaluate t h e  flux  of 
F across S1by  using  t h e  divergence  theorem  t o  relate  i t   t o  t h e  flux  across S2. 
Solution.  We  see  immediately  t h a t   div  F  = 0.  Therefore,  if  we  let  Si  be  t h e   same 
surface  a s   S 2 ,   bu t   oppositely  oriented  (so  n  points  downwards), t h e   surface  S1+ Sh  is  a 
closed surface, with  n pointing outwards everywhere.  Hence by  t h e  divergence  theorem, 

Therefore,  since we  have  n = k  on  S 2 ,  

by  integrating  in polar  coordinates (or by  symmetry).

2 .   Proof of  the  divergence  theorem. 
We  give  a n   argument  assuming  first  t h a t   t h e   vector  field  F  has   only  a  k -componen t :  
F = P ( x ,  y , z )  k  . T h e  theorem  then   says 

T h e   closed  surface  S projects  into  a  region  R  in  t h e   xy-plane.  We 
assume S is  vertically simple, i.e.,  t h a t  each vertical  line over t h e  interior 
of  R  intersects  S just  twice.  ( S  can  have  vertical  sides,  however - a 
cylinder would be  a n  example.)  S is  then   described  by  two  equations: 

(5) 

z  = g ( x ,  y) 

(lower surface); 

z  = h ( x ,  y) 

(upper  surface) 

T h e   s t ra tegy   of  t h e   proof  of  (4) will  be  t o   reduce  each  side  of  (4)  t o   a 
double  integral over R ;  t h e  two  double  integrals  will  then   t u r n  ou t   t o  be 
t h e  same. 

We  do  th is   first  for  t h e   triple  integral on  t h e  right  of  (4 ) .   Evaluating  i t   by  i te ra t ion ,  we 
get  as t h e  first  s tep   in  t h e  i te ra t ion ,

V.  VECTOR   INTEGRAL   CALCLUS 

To calculate th e  surface integral on th e  left  of  (4 ) ,  we  use t h e  formula for  t h e  surface a rea  
element  dS  given  in V9,  (13): 

where we  use  th e   + sign  if  the   normal  vector  t o  S has  a  positive  Ic-component, i.e.,  points 
generally  upwards  (as  on  t h e   upper  surface  he re ) ,   and  t h e   - sign  if  i t   points  generally 
downwards  (as  i t   does  for  t h e  lower  surface here). 
This gives for t h e  flux of  t h e  field P k  across th e  upper  surface S2,on  which  z = h (x ,  y ) ,  

while  for  t h e  flux  across  t h e  lower  surface S1,where  z  = g (x ,  y)  and   we  use  t h e   - sign  as  
described  above, we  get 

adding u p  t h e  two  fluxes t o  get  t h e  to t a l  flux  across S ,  we  have 

which  is  the   same as  th e  double integral  in  (6).  Th is  proves  (4). 
In  t h e  same way,  if  F = M ( x ,  y, z )  i  and  th e  surface  is  simple in  t h e   i  direction, we  can 
prove 

while if  F = N ( x ,  y ,  z )  j  and   th e  surface is  simple  in  th e   j direction, 

Finally,  for  a  general  field  F = M i  + N j  + P k  and   a  closed  surface S which  is  simple  in 
all  th ree   directions, we  have  only  t o  add  up  (4 ) ,  (4'),  and (4").  and   we  get  t h e   divergence 
theorem. 

If  th e  domain D  is not  bounded  by  a closed surface which is simple in all th ree  directions, 
i t   can  usually  b e   divided  up   into  smaller  domains D i   which  a r e  bounded  by  such  surfaces 
S i .   Adding  these  up  gives  t h e  divergence  theorem  for  D  and  S ,  since  th e   surface integrals 
over  th e  new  faces introduced  by  cutting  up  D  each  occur  twice, with  t h e  opposite  normal 
vectors  n ,  so t h a t  they  cancel ou t ;  after  addition, one ends up just  with  t h e  surface  integral 
over t h e  original S .
