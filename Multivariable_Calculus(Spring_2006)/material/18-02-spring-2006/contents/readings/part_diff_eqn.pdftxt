P.  Partial Differential Equations 

An  impo r t an t  application of  t h e  higher  pa r t ia l   derivatives is t h a t  th ey   a r e  used  in pa r t ia l  
differential  equations  t o  express  some  laws  of  physics  which  a r e  basic  t o  most  science  and  
engineering  subjects.  In   th i s   section, we  will  give  examples  of  a  few  such  equations.  T h e  
reason  is  pa r t ly   cu l tu ra l ,   so  you  meet  these  equations  early  and   learn  t o  recognize  them ,  
and   pa r t ly   technical:  t o  give  you  a  l i t t le  more  practice w i th   t h e   chain  rule  and   computing 
higher  derivatives. 

A  partial  differential  equ a t ion ,   P D E  for  sho r t ,  is  a n   equa t ion   involving  some  unknown 
function  of  several variables  and  one o r  more  of  i t s  p a r t i a l  derivatives.  For  example, 

is  such  a n  equation.  Evidently here  t h e  unknown  function  is  a  function  of  two variables 

we  infer  th is  from t h e  equation,  since only  x  and  y  occur  in  i t   as  independent  variables.  In  
general a  solution  of  a  pa r t ia l   differential equation  is  a  differentiable  function  t h a t   satisfies 
i t .   In  t h e  above example, t h e  functions 

w  =  xnyn  

any  n 

all  a r e   solutions  t o   t h e   equation.  In   general,  PDE 's   have  many  solutions,  far  t o o   many 
t o  find  all  of  them .   T h e  problem  is  always  t o  find  th e   one  solution  satisfying  some  ex t r a  
conditions, usually called  either  boundary  conditions or  in i t ia l  conditions depending on the i r  
n a tu r e .  

Ou r  first  impo r t an t  P D E  is  t h e   Laplace  equ a t ion   in  th r e e  dimensions: 

Any  s teady -s ta te  tempe ra tu re   d is t r ibu t ion  in  three-space 

(2) 

W  =  T ( x , Y , ~ ) ,  

T  = tempe ra tu re   a t  t h e  point  (x , y ,  z )  

satisfies Laplace's equation.  (Here  steady-state means  t h a t   i t   is  unchanging over  time,  here 
reflected  in  t h e  fact  t h a t   T  is  not  a  function  of  t ime .   For  example,  imagine  a  solid  object 
made  of  some  uniform  heat-conducting  ma te r ia l   (say  a  solid  metal  ba l l ) ,   a n d   imagine  a 
s teady   t emp e r a tu r e   distribution  on  i t s   surface  is  maintained  somehow  (say with  some  ar- 
rangement  of  wires  and   the rmos ta ts ) .   Th en   after  a  while  t h e   t emp e r a tu r e   a t   each  point 
inside  t h e   ball  will  come  t o  equilibrium - reach  a  s teady   s t a t e  - and   t h e   resulting  tem- 
pe ra tu re   function  (2) inside  t h e  ball  will  then   satisfy  Laplace's equa t ion .  

As  ano the r  example, t h e   gravitational potential

resulting from some arrangement of  masses in space satisfies Laplace's equation in any region 
R  of  space not  containing  masses.  T h e   same  is  t ru e   of  t h e   electrostatic potential  resulting 
from some collection of  electric charges in space:  (1) is satisfied in any region which  is free of 
charge.  Th is   potential  function  measures  t h e  work  done  (against t h e   field)  carrying a  unit 
tes t   mass  (or  charge)  from  a  fixed  reference  point  t o  t h e  point  ( x ,  y, z )   in  t h e  gravitational 
(or electrostatic) field.  Knowing  4 ,  t h e  field  itself  can be recovered  a s  i t s  negative  gradient: 

All  of  th is   is  just  t o   stress  t h e   fundamental  character  of  Laplace's equation - we  live  our 
lives surrounded  by  i ts  solutions. 

T h e   two-dimensional  Laplace  equation  is  similar  - you  just  d rop   t h e   te rm   involving 
z .   T h e  s teady -s ta te   tempe ra tu re   distribution  in  a  flat  metal  p la te   would  satisfy  t h e   two- 
dimensional Laplace equation, if  th e  faces of  t h e  p la te  were kept  insulated and  a s teady -s ta te  
tempe ra tu re   distribution  maintained  around  t h e  edges of  t h e  p la te .  

If  in  t h e   tempe ra tu re   model  we  include  also  heat  sources  and   sinks  in  t h e   region,  un- 
changing over  t ime ,  t h e  tempe ra tu re   function  satisfies  th e  closely  related  Poisson equation 

where  f  is  some given function  related  t o  t h e  sources  and  sinks. 

Another  impo r tan t   P D E  is  t h e  wave  equation; given below  a r e  t h e  one-dimensional and  
two-dimensional  versions;  t h e   th ree   dimensional  version  would  add   a  similar  t e rm   in  z  t o  
t h e   left: 

Here x ,  y, . . . a r e  t h e  space variables, t  is th e  t ime ,  and  c is t h e  velocity with which t h e  wave 
travels - th is  depends on t h e  medium  and  th e  type  of  wave  (light, sound ,  e tc . ) .   A solution, 
respectively 

W  =  w ( x , Y , ~ ) ,  
W  =  w ( x , t ) ,  
gives  for  each moment  to  of  time  t h e  shape  w (x ,  t o ) ,  w (x ,  y ,  to)  of  t h e  wave. 

T h e  th i rd  P D E  goes by two names, depending on t h e  context:  hea t  equation or diffusion 
equation.  T h e  one-  and   two-dimensional  versions  a re  respectively 

I t   looks  a  lot  like t h e  wave equation  ( 4 ) ,  bu t   t h e  right-hand  side th is   t ime  involves only  t h e  
first derivative, which gives i t  mathematically  and  physically  a n  entirely  different  character. 

When  i t   is  called  t h e   (one-dimensional)  hea t   equation,  a  solution  w(x, t )   represents  a 
time-varying tempe ra tu re  distribution in  say a uniform  conducting metal rod ,  with insulated 
sides.  In   t h e   same way, w ( x ,  y ,  t )  would  be  t h e   time-varying  tempe ra tu re   distribution  in  a 
flat  metal  p la te   with  insulated  faces.  For  each  moment  to   in  t ime ,   w (x ,  y , t o )  gives  t h e  
tempe ra tu re   distribution  a t  t h a t  moment. 

For  example,  if  we  assume  th e  distribution  is  steady-state,  i.e.,  not  changing with  t ime ,  
then  

a w
- = O  
a t  

(steady-state  condition)

and   t h e  two-dimensional  hea t   equation would  tu rn   into t h e   two-dimensional Laplace equa- 
tion  (1). 

When  (5)  is  referred  t o   a s   t h e   dzfluszon  equation,  say  in  one  dimension,  then   w ( x , t )  
represents  t h e   concentration  of  a  dissolved  substance  diffusing  along  a  uniform  tub e   filled 
with  liquid,  or of  a  gas  diffusing down  a  uniform  pipe. 

Notice  t h a t  all of  these PDE's a r e  second-order, t h a t  is, involve derivatives no higher  th an  
t h e   second.  The re   is  an   impo r tan t   fourth-order  P D E  in  elasticity  theo ry   ( th e   bilaplacian 
equa t ion ) ,  bu t   by  and   large t h e  general  rule seems t o  be  either  t h a t  Na tu re   is  content  with 
laws t h a t  only require second pa r t ia l  derivatives, or t h a t  these a r e  t h e  only laws t h a t  humans 
a r e  intelligent  enough  t o  formulate.
