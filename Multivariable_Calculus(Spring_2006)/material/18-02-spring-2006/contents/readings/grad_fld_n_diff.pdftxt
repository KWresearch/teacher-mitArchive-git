V2.  Gradient Fields 
and Exact Differentials 

(1)  F = V f  H 

1.  Criterion for  gradient  fields. 
Let  F  =  M ( x ,  y) i  + N ( x ,  y) j  be   a  two-dimensional  vector  field,  where  M  and   N  a r e  
continuous  functions.  The re  a re  th ree  equivalent  ways  of  saying t h a t   F is  conservative, i.e., 
a  gradient  field: 
R 
F . d r   is  path-independent  H 
Unfortunately, these  equivalent  formulations  don't  give  us  any  effective way  of  deciding 
if  a  given  field  F  is  a  conservative  field  or  not.  However,  if  we  assume  t h a t   F  is  not  just 
continuous  bu t   is  even  continuously  differentiable  (meaning:  M,  ,M y ,N,  ,Ny  all  exist  and  
a r e  continuous), then   the re   is  a  simple and   elegant  criterion  for  deciding whether  or  no t   F 
is  a  gradient field  in  some region. 
C r i t e r i o n .   Let  F = M i  + N j  be  continuously  differentiable  in  a  region  D.  Then ,   in 
D ,  

F . d r  = 0  for  any  closed C

(2) 

F = V f  for  some f ( x , y )  

M y  = N, 

. 

P r o o f .   Since F = V f ,  th is  means 

M  = f, 
M y = f x y  

and  
and  

N  = f y   . 
N , = f y , .  

Therefore, 

Bu t   since  these  two  mixed  pa r t ia l   derivatives  a r e   continuous  (since  M y   and   N,  a re ,   by 
hypothesis), a  s t and a rd   18.02 theorem  says they  a r e  equal.  Thus  M y  = N,. 

Th is  theorem may be  expressed  in a slightly different form, if  we define t h e  scalar function 
called  t h e  two-dimensional  curl of  F by 

(3) 

Then   (2) becomes 

curl F  =  N,  - M, 

Th is   criterion  allows  us  to   tes t   F  t o   see  if  it  is  a  gradient  field.  Naturally,  we  would  also 
like t o  know  t h a t   t h e  converse is  t rue :   if  curl F = 0, then  F is  a  gradient field.  As  we  shall 
see, however,  th is   requires  some  additional  hypotheses  on  th e   region  D.  For  now,  we  will 
assume D  is  t h e  whole plane.  Then  we  have 
C o n v e r s e   t o  C r i t e r i o n .   Let  F = M i  + N j  be   continuously differentiable for  all  x ,  y. 
F = V f  for  some differentiable f  a n d  all  x ,  y. 
My  = N,  for  all  x ,  y 

(4) 

Th e  proof  of  (4)  will b e  postponed until we  have more technique.  For  now we  will i l lus t ra te  
t h e  use  of  t h e  criterion  and   i t s  converse.

from th is ,  we  see immediately  t h a t  

t h e  two  equations in  t h e  last  line  show  respectively  t h a t   F and  G  satisfy  t h e   criterion  (2 ) .  
However, neither  field  is  defined a t   (O,O), so  t h a t   t h e  converse  (4) is  not  applicable.  So t h e  
question  cannot  be  decided just  on t h e  basis  of  (2) and   (4 ) .  In  fac t ,  i t   tu rn s  ou t   t h a t  F is a 
gradient field,  since  one can  check  t h a t  

On  t h e  o the r   hand ,   G  is  no t   conservative, since if  C  is  t h e   un i t   circle  x  = c o s t ,   y  = sin t ,  
we  have

2.  Finding the  potential  function. 
Example  2  above raises  t h e  question  of  how  we  found  t h e   function  a ln (x2  + Y ~ ) .More 
generally,  if  we  know  t h a t   F = V f   - for  example  if  curl  F = 0  in  t h e  whole  xy-plane -
how  do   we  find  t h e   function  f ( x , y ) ?   The re   a r e   two  methods;  some  s tuden ts   prefer  one,

Read  from  left  t o   right,  (5)  gives  us  an   easy  way  of  finding  t h e   line  integral  in  terms  of 
f (x ,  y ) .   B u t   read  right  t o  left, i t  gives us  a  way  of  finding  f (x ,  y)  by  using  t h e  line  integral:

On C2 ,  we  have  x = x l ,   dx = 0, so  t h e  integral is 

Since  t h e   integral  is  path-independent,  we  can  choose  any  p a th   we  like. 
Th e  usual  choice is  t h e  one on  t h e  right,  a s  i t   simplifies t h e  computations.

These a r e  two equations involving pa r t ia l  derivatives, which we  can solve simultaneously by

Comparing  these  two  expressions, we  see t h a t   g l (y )  = 3y2 ,  so g (y )  = y3  + c.  P u t t i n g  i t  all 
together,  using  (8),  we  get  f (x ,  y)  =  $ x2  + y2x  + Y3  + C, as before. 
In t h e  first me thod ,  t h e  answer  is written  down immediately  a s  a  line  integral; t h e  rest  of 
th e  work  is  in  evaluating t h e   integral, which  goes  quickly, since  on  a  horizontal  or  vertical 
p a th   either  dx = 0 or  dy = 0. 

In   t h e   second  me thod ,   t h e   answer  is  obtained  by  an   algorithm  involving  several  steps 
which  should  be  carried ou t   in  t h e  right  order. 

Th e  first method  has t h e  advantage of  reminding you each t ime  how f (x ,  y )  is defined and  
what  i t   means,  facts  of  theoretical  and   practical  importance.  T h e   second method  has  t h e  
advantage of  requiring no knowledge of  line integrals, which makes  i t  popular  with s tuden ts ;  
on  t h e  o the r  hand ,  when  done in  th ree  dimensions, t h e  bookkeeping  gets more complicated, 
whereas in  t h e  first method  i t   does no t ;  overall,  t h e  first method  is fas te r ,  provided  you  a r e  
confident  enough  t o  do  some of  t h e  work  mentally. 

3 .   Exact  differentials. 
T h e  formal  expressions  M ( x ,  y) dx + N ( x ,  y) dy  which  have  appea red   as  t h e   integrands 
in  our  line  integrals  a r e  called  differentials.  In   some applications, most  no tab ly   thermody-
namics,  one  usually  works  directly  with  t h e   differential  M dy  + N  dy  and   i ts   line  integral 
J M  dx + N  dy,  without  considering  or  using  t h e   associated  vector  field  F  = M  i  + N j . 
Therefore  i t   is  impo r tan t   t o  have  t h e  results  abou t  gradient fields  in  th is   section  t rans la ted  
in to  t h e  language  of  differentials.  We  do  this  now. 

If  f (x ,  y)  is  a  differentiable function,  i ts  t o t a l   differential  df  (or simply  d i f fe ren t ia l )   is by 
definition  t h e  expression 

For  example,  if  f ( x , y)  = x2y 3 ,  then   d (x2y3) = 2xy3dx + 3x2y2dy . 
We  call  t h e  differential  M dx + N  dy  e x a c t ,   in  a  region  D  where M  a n d  N  a r e  defined, 
if  i t  is  t h e  to t a l  differential  of  some function  f (x ,  y)  in  th is   region,  i.e.,  if  in  D ,  

(10) 

M = f x  

and  

N = f y ,  

fo r som e   f ( x , y ) .  

From  this  we  see t h a t   t h e  relation  between  differentials  and  vector  fields is 
is  exact  &  M i  + N j 
M dx  + N  dy 
is  a  gradient  field 
M d x + N d y   =  df  &  M i + N j   =  V f .  

In  this  language, t h e  criterion  (2) and   i ts  pa r t ia l  converse  (4) become  t h e  

Exactness  Criterion.  Assume M  a n d  N  a r e  continuously differentiable in  a  region  D 
of  th e  plane.  Then  in  this  region, 
M d x + N d y   exact  +  M y = N x ;  
(11) 
i f  D  is  th e  whole xy-plane,  My  = N,  +  M dx + N  dy  exact. 
(12) 
If  t h e  exactness  criterion  shows  t h a t   M  dx + N  dy  is  exac t ,   then   t h e   function  f ( x ,y )   may 
be  found  by  either  of  t h e  two methods  previously  described.
