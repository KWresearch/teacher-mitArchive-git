V6.  Multiply-connected 
Regions;  Topology 

In  Section V5, we  called  a  region  D of  t h e  plane  simply-connected  if  i t  had   no holes  in  i t .  
Th i s  is a typical example of wha t  would be  called  in ma thema t ics  a  topological property,  t h a t  
is, a p rope r ty  t h a t  can be  described without  using measurement.  For a curve, such properties 
a s   having  length  3 ,   o r   being  a  circle,  o r   a  line,  o r   a  triangle  - these   a r e   not  topological 
properties,  since  they   involve  measurement,  whereas  t h e   p rope r ty   of  being  closed,  o r   of 
intersecting  itself  once, would  be  topological. 

T h e   impo r tan t   th ing   abou t   topological  properties  is  t h a t   th ey   a r e   preserved  when  t h e  
geometric  figure  is  deformed  continuously  without  adding  o r   sub t rac t ing   points,  whereas 
non-topological  properties  change  under  such  a  deformation.  For  example,  if  you  deform  a 
circle, i t  will  not  s t ay  a  circle,  bu t   i t  will  still remain  a  closed  curve t h a t   does no t   intersect 
itself. 

Topology  is  t h a t   branch  of  ma thema t ics  which  studies  topological  properties  of  geomet- 
rical  figures;  it's  a  kind  of  geometry,  b u t   a t   t h e   opposite  pole  from  Euclidean  geometry, 
which  emphasizes measurement  ("congruent  triangles"  "right  angles",  "circles").  Topology 
is  a  large  and   active branch  of  ma thema t ics   today,  one which  is  a t t r a c t ing   a t t en t ion  from 
o the r   disciplines,  like  theoretical  physics  and   molecular  biology.  Most  s tud en t s  have  never 
heard  of  i t ,   because  topological  properties  don't  en te r   very  often  in to   t h e   first  few  years 
of  ma thema t ics .   However,  th ey   do   right  here,  and   in  fac t   i t   was  just  in  t h e   s tudy   of  t h e  
possible  values  of  a  line  integral  a round   a  closed  curve  t h a t   t h e   cen t ra l   ideas  of  modern 
topology  first  entered  in to  ma thema t ics ,   in  t h e  middle  of  t h e   1800's. 

So let  F be   a  continuously  differentiable vector  field  in  a  multiply-connected  - i.e.,  no t  
simply-connected  - region  D  of  t h e   xy-plane,  and   suppose  curl  F = 0.  W h a t   values  can 
F.jcF  d r   have? 
We  begin  by  considering  a n   earlier  example  (Section  V2,  Examp le   2)  in  g rea te r   detail, 
because  i t   gives  t h e   key  t o   t h e   general  case.  Consider  t h e   vector  field  representing  t h e  
electromagnetic field  of  a  wire  along t h e   z-axis  carrying  a  cons tan t   cu r ren t :  

we  know  t h a t   curl F = 0  (see  t h e  cited  Example.) 
To evaluate jcF  d r ,  where C does no t  pass th rough  t h e  origin, we  use  polar  coordinates 
and   t  a s  pa rame te r :  

As  you  move  a round   C ,  t h e  polar  angle  8 must  vary  continuously;  t h u s  we  allow  i t   t o  take  
on all values, and  do not  restrict  i t  t o  lie in t h e  interval  [ 0 , 2 ~ ] .  Using  (2 )  and  t h e  chain rule 
for  several variables, we  get 
dx  =  x,dr  + xsd8   =  cos 8 d r  - r sin 8 d8 
;, 
dy  =  s i n 8 d ~ + ~ c 0 ~ 8 d 8

V.  V E C T O R   INTEGRAL   CALCLUS 

We  calculate t h e   line  integral  as  usual; everything  cancels,  and  we  ge t  

t h e  ne t   change  in  polar  angle 0 as  you move  a round  C - since C  is closed, th i s  must  b e  an  
integer  multiple  n  of  27r.  I t   is  called  t h e  winding   number  of  C  a round   t h e  origin. 

By way  of  i l lus t ra t ion ,  t h e  value  of  t h e  winding  number n  is given  for  a  few closed  curves 
C  below;  t h e   origin  is  indicated  by  a  d o t ,  and   i t 's   unde rs tood  t h a t   a s  t  runs   from  to t o  t l ,  
t h e  curve C  is  t raced   o u t  just  once,  in  t h e  direction  shown. 

Intuitively,  t h e   winding  number  is  t h e   to t a l   number  of  times  t h a t   C  goes  a round   t h e  
origin,  counting + l  each  t im e  i t  goes  a round  counterclockwise, a n d   -1  when  i t  goes a round  
clockwise.  T h e  winding  number  of  C  a round   any o the r   point  no t   on  C  is  defined  t h e  same  
way, by  t ak ing  t h e  point  t o  b e  t h e  origin  of  a  polar  coordinate  system. 

T h e  winding number abou t  t h e  origin (or a round  any given point)  is a topological p rope r ty  
of  t h e  oriented curve C, since if  C  is deformed  continuously without  ever crossing t h e  po in t ,  
t h e   winding  numbers  mus t   also  vary  continuously,  b u t   t h e   only  way  a n   integer  can  vary 
continuously  is  t o  always  s t ay  t h e   same. 

Here  is  a  simple way  of  finding t h e  winding  number  of  C  a round   t h e  origin:  th e  winding 
number  is  t h e   to t a l   number  of  times  t h a t   C  crosses  th e   positive  x-axis,  counting  + l  each 
time  C  crosses  from below,  a n d   -1  each  t im e   i t   crosses  from  above. 

Ins tead   of  t h e   positive  x-axis,  you  can  use  any   directed  ray   from  t h e   origin, 
counting  + l  when  C  crosses  t h e   ray   in  t h e   countercloswise  direction,  a n d   -1 
when  i t   crosses  in  t h e  clockwise direction. 
\. 
Example  1 .   For  t h e   curve  shown,  a n d   t h e  th ree   choices  of  ray  given, 
calculate t h e  winding  number  using  each  in  t u r n ,   and  find  jC d r .
F 
Solution.  Each   ray  gives n  = -1  as   t h e   winding  number.  T h u s   jcF  d r   =  -27r, 
according  t o   (4)  above. 

So fa r ,  we  have  shown  by  explicit  calculation for  t h e  pa r t icu la r   field F given  by  ( I ) ,t h e  
value  of  jC  d r   depends  only  on  t h e   winding  number  of  C  a round   t h e   origin.  We  now 
F 
consider  t h e  general  s i tua t ion .  
Let  F  b e   a  vector  field  which  is  continuously  differentiable  in  a  region  D ,  and   assume 
t h a t   cu r l   F = 0  in  D .   We  will  show  now  t h a t   t h e   value  of  jCF  F.  d r   depends   only  on  t h e  
topological  properties  of  C ,  a n d  no t   on  i t s  exac t  position  o r   length. 

To  see th i s ,  we  will  assume t h a t  D  consists of  one  connected region  having  k  holes.  T h e  
holes  come f rom  removing po r t ions  of  t h e  region - we might remove a po in t ,  a line segment, 
t h e  interior  of  a  circle,  t h e   l e t t e r  Y ,  e tc .   We  could  no t   remove  a  circle, however,  since  th en  
wha t   was  left  would  no t   b e  one connected  piece.

V6 .   MULTIPLY-CONNECTED   REGIONS ;   T O P O L O G Y  
Draw  a  simple closed curve C l ,  directed  counterclockwise,  around  t h e  i - t h  hole,  a n d  let 
Ai  =  hlF . d r .  
Then   for  any  closed curve C  in   t h e  region,  we  claim  t h a t  
h F . dr
=  n l A l   + . . . + n k A k ,  
where  n i   is  t h e  winding  number  of  C  a round   t h e  i - t h   hole  (i.e.,  t h e  winding  number  of  C 
a round  any point  inside  t h a t   i - th  hole).

(6) 

We  shall  indicate  how  th e   argument  goes  in  a  few  cases;  t h e   general  case  would  take  
us  farther  in to   topology  t h a n   we  a r e   able  t o   go  a t   present.  T h e   essential  tool  is  Green's 
theorem. 
Example  2 .   Suppose  C  is  a  p a th   like  th e  one  pictured  (k = 3  in  t h e  picture,  bu t   th is  
isn't significant.)  Let  Ci  be t h e  curve Ci  with  i t s  direction  reversed.  Th en  F  is continuously 
differentiable  in  t h e   region  between  C  a n d   t h e  C l ,   and   also  curl  F  = 0.  Therefore by  t h e  
extended form of  Green's theorem  (Section V5 ) ,  we  get 

F . d r   +  . . .  + 

F . d r   =  0 ,  

so t h a t  

h F . d r  =  A1  + . . . +  Ak, 

proving  (6)  in  th is  case. 

Example 3 .   If  the re  is just  one hole,  Example 2  shows t h a t  for  any simple closed curve 
going counterclockwise  around  t h e  hole, 

(In  t h e  first  example  (4) discussed,  A1  = 2 r . )  

C  = 

C,  +  C,

Suppose  now  t h a t   C  is  a  closed  curve  going  around  twice,  as  in  t h e   illustration.  Break 
C  in to   t h e   sum  of  two  simple closed curves  as  shown, using  a  point  where  i t   crosses  itself; 
then  

Example  4.  This example combines t h e  two above.  If  C  is  as shown  (here k = 2 ) ,  then  
C  = D l   + D 2 ;  let  D i   be  D i   with  t h e   direction  reversed.  Then   D l   + D;  is  a  simple curve 
having  only  hole  number  1 in  i ts   interior.  Therefore 

One final  remark.  If  F  is  a s  above, with  curl F  = 0 ,  and  we  t r y  
t o  find  a  function  f (x ,  y )   for which  F  = A f ,  by  defining 

th is   won't  work  because  t h e   value  of  f ( a ,  y)  depends  not  just  on  (x ,  y )   bu t   also  on  t h e  
p a th   of  integration  used.  However, equation  (6) shows t h a t   two  different  values  for  t h e  line 
integfral always differ by  a  number  of  t h e  form  n l A l  + . . . + n k A k ,  because  if  C1 and  Cz a r e  
two  different  choices of p a th   from  (a ,b)  t o   ( a ,  y ) ,  then   C1 + C;  is  a  closed p a t h ,   and  thus

Here  n i   is  t h e  winding  number  of  t h e   p a th   C1 + C;  a round   t h e   i - th   hole. 
Therefore 

J C I  

Now  if  (x ,  y)  is moved a  little, and t h e  pa ths  C1 a n d  C2 a r e  moved accordingly, t h e  numbers 
n l ,  . . . ,nk  will  not  change since they  a r e  winding numbers.  Thu s ,  even  though  t h e  function 
f (x ,  y)  defined by  ( 7 )  is multiple-valued, according t o   (8) t h e  different  determinations  of  i ts  
value  differ  by  a  cons tan t ,   and   therefore  all  have  t h e   same  derivative.  Thus   we  can  claim 
t h a t   t h e  multiple-valued  function  f (x ,  y)  is  differentiable,  and  

Our  conclusion  is  t h a t ,  if  curl F = 0  in  a  multiply-connected  region,  even  if  t h e  field  is  not 
conservative  we  can  still  view  i t   as t h e  gradient field of  a  multiple-valued  function  f (x ,  y ) .  

For  example, going back t o  our first  significant  example, equation  (3) shows t h a t  we may 
take   f ( a ,  y) = 8 (x ,  y ) ,  t h e  multiple-valued  polar  angle.  No  m a t t e r   which  determination  of  8 
you  pick,  i t   is  still  t r u e  t h a t   for  some n ,  
8  =  tan - 1 -Y  +  2 n r ,
