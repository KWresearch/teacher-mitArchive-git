Given a square array A of  numbers, we  associate with i t  a number  called th e  determinant 
For 2 x 2 and  3 x 3 arrays, th e  number  is defined  by

or 
of  A, and written  either

Do  not  memorize these as formulas 
learn instead  the  pa t te rns  which give th e  terms.  Th e  
- 
2 x 2 case is easy:  the  product  of  the  elements on one diagonal  (the "main diagonal"), minus 
th e  product  of  the  elements on  th e  other  ( the  "antidiagonal"). 
For  the  3  x  3 case,  three products  get  th e  + sign:  those  formed from  th e  main diagonal, 
or  having  two  factors  parallel  t o   the   main  diagonal.  Th e   other  three  get  a  negative  sign: 
it.' 
Try  th e  following example 
those from the  antidiagonal, or  having two factors parallel  t o  
on  your  own,  then  check  your  work against  the  solution.

expansion. 
Though  th e   letters  a ,  b, c, . . .  can  be  used  for  very  small  determinants,  they  can't  for 
larger  ones;  it's  important  early  on  t o   get  used  t o   th e   s tanda rd   notation  for  th e   entries 
of  determinants.  This  is  what  th e   common  software  packages and  th e   literature  use.  The  
determinants  of  order  two and  three would  be written  respectively

In  general,  t h e   ij-entry, w r i t ten   a i j ,  is  t h e  number  in  t h e  i - th   row  and  j - t h   column. 

I t s   ij-minor, w r i t ten   IAij 1,  is  t h e   determinant  th a t ' s  left  after  deleting  from  IAl  t h e   row 
and  column  containing  aij. 
I t s  ij-cofactor, w r i t ten  here A i j  , is given a s  a  formula by  Aij  = (- l ) j + j  lAij 1.  For  a  3 x 3

Laplace  expansion  by  co fac to rs  

Th is  is ano the r  way  t o  evaluate a  de te rm inan t ;  we  give th e  rule for a  3 x 3.  I t  generalizes 
easily  t o  a n  n  x  n  de te rm inan t .  

Select  any row  (or  column)  of  the  determinant.  Multiply  each  entry a i j   in  tha t   row  (or 
column)  by  i t s  cofactor A i j ,   and  add  the  three  resulting numbers; you  get  the  value  of  the 
determinant. 

As  practice with no ta t ion ,  here  is  t h e  formula for  t h e  Laplace expansion  of  a  th i rd   order 
(i.e.,  a  3 x  3) determinant  using  t h e  cofactors of  th e  first  row: 

and  t h e  formula  using  t h e  cofactors of  th e  j - t h   column:

In   each  case, choose t h e  sign which makes  t h e  left  side non-negative. 
Proof of  (5 ) .   We  begin  with  two  preliminary  observations. 
Let  8  be  t h e   positive  angle  from  A  t o  B ;  we  assume  i t   is  < 7 r ,  
so  t h a t  A  a n d  B have  t h e  general positions  illustrated. 
Let  8' = 7r/2  - 8 ,  as  illustrated.  Then   cos 8' = sin 8. 

Draw  t h e   vector  B '  obtained  by  ro ta t ing   B  t o   t h e   right  by  7r/2.  T h e  
p ic tu re  shows t h a t  B' = (b2, -bl),  and   JB'J= J B J .  

To prove  (5) now, we  have  a  s t and a rd  formula of  Euclidean  geometry,

This proves t h e  a rea  in te rp re ta t ion  (5) if  A  and  B have t h e  position  shown.  If  the i r  positions 
a r e  reversed,  then   t h e   a rea  is  t h e  same, bu t   t h e  sign  of  t h e  determinant  is  changed,  so t h e

18.02  NOTES 

For  n  x  n  determinants,  t h e   analog  of  definition  (1 )   is  a  b i t   complicated,  and   no t   used 
t o   compute  them ;   t h a t ' s  done  by  t h e   analog  of  t h e   Laplace  expansion,  which  we  give  in 
a  moment,  or  by  using  Fact  D-4  in  a  systematic  way  t o  make  t h e   entries  below  t h e  main 
diagonal  all  zero.  Generalizing  (5) and   (6),  n  x  n  determinants  can  b e   interpreted  a s   t h e  
hypervolume  in  n-space of  a  n-dimensional  parallelotope. 
For n  x n  determinants,  t h e  minor  lAij I  of  t h e  en t ry  aij is defined  t o  be  t h e  determinant 
obtained  by  deleting  t h e  i - t h  row  and  j - t h   column; t h e  cofactor Aij  is  t h e  minor,  prefixed 
by  a  + or  - sign  according  t o   t h e  n a tu r a l   generalization  of  t h e   checkerboard  p a t t e rn   ( 2 ) .  
Then   t h e  Laplace  expansion  by  t h e  i - th   row would  be 

This  is  a n   inductive  calculation  - i t   expresses  t h e   de te rm inan t   of  order  n  in  te rms   of 
determinants  of  order n - 1.  Thus ,  since we  can  calculate  de te rm inan ts  of  order 3, i t  allows 
us  t o  calculate  determinants  of  order  4;  then   de te rm inan ts  of  order 5 ,  and  so on.  If  we  take  
for  definiteness  i = 1 ,  then   t h e   above Laplace  expansion  formula  can  be  used  as  t h e   basis 
of  a n  inductive  definition  of  t h e  n  x  n  de te rm inan t .
