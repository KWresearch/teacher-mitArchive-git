CV.  Changing Variables 
in Multiple Integrals 

1.  Changing variables. 
Double  integrals  in  x ,  y  coordinates which  a re  taken  over  circular  regions,  or  have  inte- 
grands  involving  th e  combination  x 2  + y2 ,  a re  often  b e t t e r   done in  polar  coordinates: 

Th is   involves  introducing  t h e   new  variables  r  and   19,  together  with  t h e   equations  relating 
them   t o  x ,  y  in  bo th   t h e  forward  and  backward  directions: 

Changing  t h e  integral t o  polar  coordinates th en  requires  th ree  steps: 

A .   Changing t h e  integrand  f (x ,  y)  t o  g ( r ,  8 ) ,  by  using  (2); 

B .   Supplying t h e  a rea  element  in  t h e  r ,  I9  system:  dA =  r d r  dB  ; 
C .   Using  th e  region  R  t o  determine t h e  limits  of  integration  in  t h e  r ,  I9  system. 

In  t h e   same  way,  double  integrals  involving  other  types   of  regions  or  integrands  can 
sometimes be  simplified by  changing  t h e  coordinate system  from x ,  y  t o  one be t te r   adap ted  
t o   t h e   region  or  integrand.  Let's  call  t h e   new  coordinates  u  and   v ;   th en   the re   will  be 
equations introducing t h e  new  coordinates,  going in  bo th   directions: 

(often  one  will  only  get  or  use  t h e   equations  in  one  of  these  directions).  To  change  t h e  
integral  t o   u,v-coordinates,  we  then   have  t o   carry  out  t h e   th ree   s teps  A ,  B ,  C  above.  A 
first  s tep  is  t o  picture  t h e  new  coordinate system; for this we  use  t h e  same idea  a s  for polar 
coordinates, namely,  we  consider  t h e  grid  formed by  t h e  level  curves  of  t h e  new  coordinate

functions:

(4) 

u ( x ,  y )  = UO, 

v ( x , y )  = vo  . 

Once  we  have  th is ,   algebraic  and   geometric  intuition  will  usually  handle 
steps  A  and   C ,  bu t   for  B  we  will  need  a  formula:  i t   uses  a  determinant 
called  t h e  J a cob i an ,  whose notation  and  definition  a r e  

v=v2  

Using i t ,  t h e  formula  for  t h e  a rea  element  in  t h e  u ,  v-system  is 

2 

18.02  NOTES  

so t h e  change of  variable  formula  is 

where  g (u ,  v)  is  obtained  from  f (x ,  y)  by  subs t i tu t ion ,  using  th e  equations  ( 3 ) .  
We will  derive  t h e  formula  (5)  for  t h e  new  a rea  element  in t h e  next  section; for  now  let's 
check t h a t  i t  works  for  polar  coordinates. 

Example 1.  Verify  (1)  using  t h e  general formulas  (5)  and   (6) 
Solution.  Using  (2 ) ,  we  calculate: 

so t h a t   dA  =  r d r  dB,  according t o   (5)  and  (6); note t h a t  we  can omit  t h e  absolute value, 
since by  convention, in  integration  problems  we  always assume r  2 0, a s  is  implied  already 
by  t h e  equations  (2). 

We  now  work  a n   example  illustrating  why  t h e   general  formula  is  needed  a n d   how  i t   is 
used;  i t   illustrates  s tep  C  also - pu t t ing   in  t h e  new  limits  of  integration.

Solution.  Th is  would  be a  painful  integral  t o  work ou t  in rectangular  coordinates. 
Bu t   t h e  region  is  bounded  by  t h e  lines

and  t h e  integrand also contains  t h e  combinations x - y a n d  x + y.  These powerfully  suggest 
t h a t   t h e   integral will  be  simplified  by  t h e   change  of  variable  (we  give  i t  also  in  t h e   inverse 
direction, by  solving t h e  first  pair  of  equations  for  x  and  y): 

We  will  also need  t h e  new  a rea  element; using  (5)  and   (9)  above.  we  get 

note  t h a t  i t   is  t h e  second  pair  of  equations in  (9)  t h a t   were  used,  no t   t h e   ones  introducing 
u  and  v.  Thu s  t h e  new  a rea  element  is  (this time we  do  need  t h e  absolute value  sign in  (6)) 

We  now  combine  s teps  A  and   B  t o   get  t h e   new  double  integral;  subs t i tu t ing   into  t h e  
integrand  by  using  t h e  first  pair  of  equations  in  (9), we  get

In  uv-coordinates,  t h e   boundaries  (8) of  th e   region  a r e   simply  u  = f1 ,   v  = f1 ,   so  t h e

We  have

2.  The  area element. 
In   polar  coordinates, we  found  t h e   formula  dA  =  r d r  dB  for  t h e   a r e a  element  by 
drawing  t h e   grid  curves  r  = ro  and   6'  = Bo  for  t h e  r , 6'-system, a n d   determining  (see 
t h e  picture)  t h e  infinitesimal  a rea  of  one  of  t h e  little elements  of  t h e  grid. 

For  general  u,v-coordinates,  we  do   t h e   same  thing.  T h e   grid  curves  (4)  divide  up   t h e  
plane in to  small regions AA  bounded  by these contour curves.  If  t h e  contour curves a r e  close 
together,  they  will be approximately parallel,  so t h a t  t h e  grid element will be approximately 
a  small parallelogram,  and

v = v 0

u = u o  

P : ( u o , v o ) ,   Q : ( u ~ + A u , v o ) ,   R : ( u o , v o + A v ) ;  

In  t h e  uv-system,  t h e  points  P ,  Q ,  R  have  t h e  coordinates

t o  use  t h e  cross-product  however  in  (13), we  need  P Q  a n d  P R  in  i j  - coordinates. 
Consider  P Q  first; we  have 

P Q   =  A x i  + A y j   , 
(14) 
where  Ax  and  Ay  a r e  t h e  changes in x  and  y  a s  you  hold  v = vo  and  change uo  t o  uo + A u .  
According  t o  t h e  definition  of  pa r t ia l  derivative, 

so t h a t   by  (14 ) ,  

In  t h e  same way, since in moving  from  P t o  R  we  hold  u  fixed a n d  increase vo  by  Av ,  

We  now  use  (13); since t h e  vectors a r e  in  t h e  xy-plane,  P Q  x P R  has  only  a  k -component, 
and  we  calculate from  (15) and   (16) t h a t

where we  have first taken  t h e  transpose of  t h e  determinant  (which doesn't  change i t s  value), 
and   then   factored  t h e   A u   and   Av  ou t   of  t h e   two  columns.  Finally,  tak ing   t h e   absolute 
value,  we  get  from  (13)  and   (17 ) ,  and   t h e  definition  (5) of  Jacob ian ,  

passing  t o   t h e   limit  a s  A u ,  Av  + 0  and   dropping  t h e  subscript  0  (so  t h a t  P  becomes  any 
point  in  t h e  plane), we  get  t h e  desired formula  for  t h e  a rea  element, 

3 .   Examples  and  comments; putting  in  limits. 
If  we  write t h e  change of  variable  formula a s  

(18) 
where 

i t   looks  a s  if  t h e  essential  equations we  need  a r e  t h e  inverse  equations: 

ra the r   t h a n   th e  direct  equations we  a r e  usually  given: 

If  i t   is  awkward t o  get  (20) by  solving  (21) simultaneously for  x  and   y in  te rms   of  u  and  v, 
sometimes one  can  avoid  having  t o   do  th is   by  using  t h e   following relation  (whose  proof  is 
an  application  of  t h e  chain  rule,  a n d  left  for  t h e  Exercises): 

Th e   right-hand  Jacobian  is  easy  t o  calculate  if  you  know  u (x ,  y)  and   v ( x ,  y ) ;  then   t h e  left- 
hand  one - t h e   one  needed  in  (19) - will  be  i t s   reciprocal.  Unfortunately,  i t   will  be  in 
te rms   of  x  and   y  instead  of  u  and   v,  so  (20)  still  ought  t o   be  needed,  bu t   sometime 
gets  lucky.  T h e  next  example illustrates. 

Example  3.  Evaluate 
d x d y ,  where  R  is  t h e   region  p ic tu red ,   having 
x 
as boundaries  t h e  curves x2  - y2 = 1,  x2  - y2 = 4,  y = 0,  y = x / 2   . 
Solution.  Since t h e  boundaries  of  t h e   region  a re  contour  curves of  x2  - y2  a n d   y /x   , 
and  t h e  integrand  is  y l x ,  th is   suggests making t h e  change  of  variable

We  will  t ry   to   get  through  without  solving these  backwards  for  x ,  y  in  te rms   of  u ,  v.  Since 
changing t h e  integrand  t o  t h e  u ,  v variables  will give no  trouble,  t h e  question is whether  we 
can get  t h e  Jacobian  in  te rms  of  u  and  v  easily.  I t   all works ou t ,  using  (22): 

according t o   (22). We  use  now  (18 ) ,  put  in  t h e  limits,  and  evaluate; no te  t h a t   t h e  answer  is 
positive,  as i t   should  be,  since  t h e  integrand  is  positive. 

Putting in the  limits 

In  t h e  examples  worked  ou t   so  fa r ,  we  had   no  trouble  finding  t h e   limits  of  integration, 
since  t h e  region R was  bounded  by  contour  curves  of  u  and  v, which  meant  t h a t   t h e  limits 
were  constants. 

If  t h e  region is not bounded  by  contour curves, maybe you should use a different change of 
variables,  bu t   if  th is  isn't possible, you'll  have t o  figure ou t  t h e  uv-equations  of  t h e  boundary 
curves.  T h e  two  examples  below  illustrate. 
Example  4.  Let  u  = x  + y ,   v  = x - y ;   change  l1 lx dy dx  t o   a n   i te ra ted   integral 
du dv. 

Solution.  Using  (19)  and   (22 ) ,  we  calculate - =  -112,  so  t h e   Jacobian  factor

in  t h e  a rea  element will  be  112. 

To  pu t   in  t h e   new  limits,  we  sketch  t h e   region  of  integration,  a s  shown  a t   t h e  
right.  T h e  diagonal boundary  is t h e  contour curve v = 0; t h e  horizontal a n d  vertical 
boundaries  a r e  not  contour  curves - wha t   a r e  their  uv-equations?  The re  a r e  two 
ways  t o   answer  th is ;   t h e   first  is  more  widely  applicable,  bu t   requires  a  sepa ra te  
calculation  for  each  boundary  curve. 

Method 1 Eliminate x  a n d  y from  th e  three simultaneous equations  u  = u ( x ,  y ) ,  v = v (x ,  y ) ,  
and   th e  xy-equation  of  th e  boundary  curve.  For  t h e  x-axis  and  x  = 1 ,  th is   gives 

Method  2  Solve for x  a n d  y  in  terms of u ,  v;  then  sub s t i tu t e  x  = x ( u ,  v ) ,   y = y ( u ,  v)  in to  
th e  xy-equation  of t h e  curve. 

Using th is  me thod ,  we get  x  = $ ( u + v ) ,   y = i ( u - v ) ;   subs t i tu t ing  in to  t h e  xy-equations:

To  change  t h e   integrand,  we  want  to   express  x2   in  te rms   of  u  a n d   v;  th is   suggests 
eliminating  y  from  th e  u ,  v  equations; we  get

From  Example  3 ,  we  know  t h a t   th e   Jacobian  factor  is

absolute value  sign.  So by  (18) our  integral becomes 

Finally,  we  have  t o   pu t   in  th e   limits.  T h e   x-axis  and   th e   left-hand  bounda ry   curve

boundary  curve xy  = 1 .   To  change  this  t o  u - v  coordinates,  we  follow Me thod   1: 

T h e   form  of  this  upper  limit  suggests  t h a t   we  should  in teg ra te   first  with 
respect  to   u.  Therefore  we  hold  v  fixed,  and   let  u  increase;  th is   gives  t h e

Th e   rays we  use  a r e  those  intersecting  R:  they  s t a r t   from  t h e   lowest  ray,  corresponding 
to  v = 0 ,  and  go t o  t h e  ray  v = a ,  where  a  is  the  slope of  OP. Thus  ou r   integral  is

To  complete  t h e   work,  we  should  determine  a  explicitly.  Th is   can  b e   done  by  solving 
xy  =  1 and   x2  - Y 2   =  1 simultaneously  t o   find  t h e   coordinates  of  P.  A  more  elegant 
approach  is  t o  add  y = a x   (representing  t h e  line  O P )  t o  t h e  list  of  equations,  and   solve all 
th ree   simultaneously  for  t h e   slope  a .   We  subs t i tu te   y  = a x   into  t h e   o the r   two  equations, 
and  get

4.  Changing coordinates  in  triple  integrals 
Here  t h e  coordinate change will  involve th ree  functions 

bu t   th e  general  principles  remain  t h e  same.  T h e  new  coordinates u ,  v ,  and  w  give  a  three- 
dimensional grid, made  up   of  t h e   th ree   families  of  contour  surfaces  of  u ,  v,  and  w.  Limits 
a r e  pu t   in  by  t h e  kind  of  reasoning  we  used  for  double  integrals.  W h a t   we  still  need  is  t h e  
formula for t h e  new  volume  element  dV .  

To  get  t h e   volume  of  t h e   l i t t le   six-sided  region  AV   of  space  bounded  by  th ree   pairs  of 
these  contour  surfaces,  we  note  t h a t   nearby  contour  surfaces  a r e   approximately  parallel, 
so  t h a t   AV   is  approximately  a  parallelepiped,  whose  volume  is  (up  t o   sign)  t h e   3  x  3 
determinant  whose rows  a r e  t h e  vectors  forming t h e  th ree  edges of  AV  meeting  a t  a  corner. 
These vectors  a r e  calculated  a s  in  section  2;  after  passing  t o  t h e   limit  we  get

dV  =  l a ( x ' y ' Z )   d u d v dw   ,

where  t h e  key  factor  is  t h e  Jacobian 

As  a n  example,  you  can  verify  t h a t   th is   gives  t h e   correct  volume  element  for  t h e   change 
from  rectangular  t o  spherical  coordinates: 

while th is   is  a  good  exercise,  i t   will  make  you  realize  why  most  people  prefer  t o  derive t h e  
volume  element  in  spherical coordinates  by  geometric  reasoning.
