G is called a vector  potential for F .  A suitable region is one with  th is  property:  whenever P 
lies in  t h e  region,  t h e  whole line  segment  joining  P t o  t h e  origin  lies in  t h e  region.  (Instead 
of  t h e  origin,  one  could  use  some other  fixed  point.)  For  instance,  a  sphere,  a  cube,  or  all 
of  3-space would  be  suitable regions. 
Suppose for  instance t h a t   V .F = 0 in all of  3-space.  Th en  G exists in all of  3-space, and  
is  given by  t h e  formula 

G  = 

t F ( t x , t y , t z )  x  R d t ,  

R = x i  + y j  + z k  

Th e   integral means:  in teg ra te  separately each  component  of  t h e   vector  function  occurring 
in  th e  integrand,  and  you'll  get t h e  corresponding component  of  G. 

We shall not prove th is  formula here; t h e  proof  depends on  Leibniz' rule for differentiating 
under  a n  integral sign.  We  can however  t r y  ou t   t h e  formula. 
a )   Let  F = y i  + z j  + x k  . Check  t h a t   div  F=O,  find G from  t h e  formula  (** ) ,  and  
check your  answer  by  verifying  t h a t   F = curl G. 

b)  Show  t h a t   G is  unique  up   t o  t h e  addition  of  a n   a rb i t ra ry   gradient  field;  i.e.,  if 
G is one such  field, then   all others  a r e  of  t h e  form 

for  an  a rb i t ra ry   function  f (x ,  y ,  2). (Show t h a t   if  GI has  t h e  form  ( * **), th en  F = curl GI; 
then   show  conversely  t h a t   if  G'  is  a  field  such  t h a t   curl  GI  = F ,  th en   GI  has   t h e   form 
(***).I

6H-10  Let  B be  a  magnetic field produced  by  a moving  electric field  E.  Assume  there  a r e  
no  charges in  t h e  region.  Th en  one  of  Maxwell's equations in  differential  form  reads 

Wh a t  is t h e  integrated  form of  this law?  Prove your  answer, a s  in t h e  notes; you can assume 
t h a t   t h e  partial  differentiation  can be moved  outside of  t h e  integral  sign. 

6H-11*  In  t h e   preceding  problem  if  we  also  allow  for  a  field  j  which  gives  t h e   current 
density  a t   each  point  of  space,  we  get  Ampere's  law in  differential  form  (as  modified  by 
Maxwell) : 

Give  t h e   integrated  form  of  th is   law,  and   deduce  i t   from  t h e   differential  form,  a s  done  in  
t h e  notes.
