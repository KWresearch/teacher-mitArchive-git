V8.  Vector Fields in Space 

Ju s t   a s  in  Section V1 we  considered  vector  fields in  th e  plane, so now  we  consider  vector 
fields in  three-space.  These a r e  fields given by  a  vector  function  of  t h e  typ e  

Such  a  function  assigns  th e   vector  F ( x o ,  yo, zo )  t o  a  point  ( s o ,  yo, zo )  where  M ,  N ,  and   P 
a re  all defined.  We place t h e  vector  so i t s  ta i l  is a t   ( s o ,  yo, zo ) ,  and  in th is  way  get  t h e  vector 
field.  Such  a  field  in  space looks a  l i t t le  like t h e  interior  of  a  haystack. 

As  before,  we  say  F  is  continuous  in  some  domain  D  of  3-space  (we  will  usually  use 
LLdomain"r a th e r  t h a n   "region"  , when  referring t o  a  portion  of  3-space)  if  M ,  N ,  and  P a r e  
continuous  in  t h a t   domain.  We  say  F  is  continuously  differentiable  in  t h e   domain  D  if  all 
nine  first  pa r t ia l   derivatives 

M z ,  My,  Mz;  Nx,  N y ,  Nz ;   Px,P Y ,  pz 

exist  and   a r e  continuous  in  D. 

Again  a s  before, we  give two physical  in te rp re ta t ions  for  such  a  vector  field. 

T h e  three-dimensional  force  fields  of  different  so r ts  - gravitational,  electrostatic,  elec- 
tromagnetic - all give rise t o  such a vector field:  a t  t h e  point  ( s o ,  yo, zo )  we  place t h e  vector 
having  t h e  direction  and  magnitude  of  t h e  force which  t h e   field  would  exert  on  a  unit  tes t  
particle placed  a t  t h e  point. 

T h e  three-dimensional  flow  fields  and   velocity  fields  arising  from  t h e  motion  of  a  fluid 
in  space  a r e  t h e  o the r   s t and a rd   example.  We  assume  t h e  motion  is  s teady -s ta te   (i.e.,  th e  
direction  and  magnitude  of  t h e  flow  a t   any  point  does  not  change  over  t ime ) .   We  will  call 
this  a  three-dimensional flow. 

As  before,  we  allow sources and  sinks - places  where fluid  is being  added   t o  or  removed 
from  t h e   flow.  Obviously,  we  can  no  longer  appeal  t o   people  s tand ing   overhead  pouring 
fluid  in  a t  various  points  (they  would  have  t o  be   aliens  in  four-space),  bu t   we  could  think 
of  th in   pipes  inserted  into  t h e  domain a t  various points  adding or  removing fluid. 

T h e  velocity  field  of  such  a  flow  is  defined  just  as  it  was  previously:  v ( x ,  y ,  z )  gives  th e  
direction  a n d  magnitude  (speed) of  t h e  flow  a t   (x ,  y ,z ) . 
T h e  flow  field  F = dv ,  where  d(x, y ,  z )  is  t h e  density) may  be   similarly  interpreted: 

dir  F  =  t h e  direction  of  flow 
IF1  =  mass  t ranspo r t   r a t e   (per unit  a rea )   a t   (x ,  y ,  z )  in  th e  flow  direction; 

( 2 )  

t h a t   is,  IF1  is  t h e   r a t e   per  unit  a r e a  a t   which  mass  is  t ranspo r ted   across  a  small  piece  of 
plane  perpendicular  t o  t h e  flow  a t   t h e  point  (x ,  y ,  z ) . .  

T h e  derivation  of  this  interpretation  is  exactly  a s  in  Sections V1  and   V3,  replacing  th e  
small  line  segment  A1  by  a  small plane a r e a  AA  perpendicular  t o  t h e  flow. 
Example  1 .   Find  t h e  three-dimensional  electrostatic  force  field  F arising from  a  unit 
positive charge placed  a t  th e  origin, given t h a t  in suitable un i ts  F is directed radially outward 
from t h e  origin and  has magnitude  l l p 2 ,  where  p  is t h e  distance  from  t h e  origin.

S o l u t i o n .   T h e  vector  x i  + y j  + z k  with  ta i l   a t   (x ,  y ,  z )   is  directed  radially  outward 
and  has magnitude  p.  Therefore 

E x a m p l e  2.  a )  F ind  t h e  velocity  field  of  a  fluid ro ta t ing  with  cons tan t  angular velocity 
w a round   t h e   z-axis,  in  t h e   direction  given  by  t h e   right-hand  rule  (right-hand  fingers  curl 
in  direction  of  flow  when  thumb  points  in  t h e   k -direction). 

b)  F ind   t h e  analogous field  if  t h e  flow  is  ro ta t ing   abou t   t h e  y-axis. 

S o l u t i o n .   a )  T h e  flow doesn't depend on z - i t  is really just  a two-dimensional  problem, 
whose  solution  is  th e   same  a s  before  (section V1,  Example 4): 
F ( x ,  y , z )   =  w ( -y i   + x j )  . 
b)  If  th e  axis of  flow  is  th e  y-axis, t h e  flow will have no  j -component  a n d  will not  depend 
on  y.  However,  by  t h e   right-hand  rule,  t h e   flow  in  t h e   xz-plane  is  clockwise,  when  t h e  
positive  x  and  z  axes  a r e  drawn  so as t o  give  a  right-handed  system.  Thu s  

E x a m p l e  3.  F ind   th e   three-dimensional  flow  field  of  a  gas  s t ream ing  radially  outward 
with  constant  velocity  from  a  source  a t  t h e  origin  of  constant  s t reng th .  

S o l u t i o n .   This is like th e  corresponding two-dimensional  problem  (section V1, Example 
3 ) ,   except  t h a t   t h e   area  of  a  sphere  increases  like  t h e   square  of  i ts   radius.  Therefore,  t o  
maintain  constant  velocity,  th e   density  of  flow  must  decrease  like  llp2a s  you  go  ou t   from 
t h e  origin; le t t ing  6  be  t h e  density  and  ci  be  constants, we  get 

Notice  t h a t   in  t h e  three-dimensional  case, th is   field  is  t h e  same  as  t h e  one in Example  1 
above, with  t h e  magnitude  falling  off  like  l / p 2 .   For  t h e  two-dimensional  case,  th e  analogue 
of  a point  fluid  source a t  t h e  origin  is  not  a point  charge a t  th e  origin, bu t   a  uniform  charge 
along a  vertical  wire;  bo th   give t h e  field whose magnitude  falls  off  like  l l r  .
