Part  B 

(18  points) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate,  solutions 
must  be written  up  independently.  It  is  illegal  to  consult materials  from  previous  semesters.  With 
each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 

Problem  0.  (not  until  due  date;  2  points) Write  the  names  of  all  the  people  you  consulted  or 
with whom  you  collaborated  and  the  resources  you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no  consultation”.  (See 
full  explanation  on  PS1). 

Problem  1.  (Thursday  7  points:  2+2+1+2) 

a)  Find  the  position  vector  of  the  tra jectory  of  circular  motion  in  the  plane  around  the  origin 
starting  at  (−1, 0)  going  clockwise  at  unit  speed. 

b)  Find  the  position  vector  of  the  tra jectory  of  circular  motion  in  the  plane  around  the  origin 
starting  at  (10, 0)  going  counterclockwise  at  speed  60. 

c)  Do  part  (b)  again  but  this  time  at  speed  60  rpm  (t measured  in minutes). 

d)  Find  the  position  and  velocity  vectors  of  the  tra jectory  with  initial  position  (at  time  t = 0) 
r0  = jˆ,  initial  velocity  v 0  = − ˆi,  and  acceleration  a = (cos t)ˆi − (sin t)jˆ + ˆk. 

Problem  2.  (Friday  9  points:  2  +  2  +  2  +  3) 

a)  Show  that  if  a  tra jectory  is  on  a  sphere  centered  at  the  origin,  then  its  velocity  is  tangent  to 
the  sphere.  (Write  the  equation  for  the  distance  squared  to  the  origin  and  diﬀerentiate.) 
b)  Show  that  the  tra jectory  with  position  vector  r  =  cos t sin(2t)ˆi + sin t sin(2t)jˆ + cos(2t) ˆk  is 
on  the  unit  sphere  centered  at  the  origin. 

c)  Find  the  velocity  vector  of  the  tra jectory  in  part  (b). 

d) Find the angle this tra jectory makes with the equator (intersection of the sphere with z  = 0).
