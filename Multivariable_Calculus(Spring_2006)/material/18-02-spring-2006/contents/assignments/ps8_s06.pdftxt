Part  B 

(22  points) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate, 
solutions must  be  written  up  independently.  It  is  illegal  to  consult materials  from  previous 
semesters.  With  each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 
Problem  0.  (not  until  due  date;  3  points) 
Write  the  names  of  all  the  people you  consulted  or with whom you  collaborated and  the 
resources  you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no  consultation”. 

b) Compute 

Consider  the  vector  ﬁeld  F (x, y) = 

F  · dr , where C2  is  the  triangle in  the ﬁrst quadrant formed by  the  axes 

Problem  1.  (Thursday;  5  points:  2 +  3)  Let  F  = y 2ˆı + x2yˆ� 
a)  Let  C1  be  the  ellipse  x2  + 4y2  = 4  traced  (once)  counterclockwise.  Compute  the  line 
�
F  · dr .  (The  circle  in  the  integral  is  new  notation.  It  is  optional:  its  purpose  is 
integral 
C1 
to  emphasize  that  the  integral  is  around  a  loop,  that  is,  a  closed  curve.) 
�
C2 
and  the  line  x + y = a  traced  counterclockwise.  (a > 0.) 
Problem  2.  (Friday;  8  points:  1 +2 +  2 +  3) 
−y ˆı + x ˆ� 
. 
x2  + y2 
a)  Show  that  F  is  the  gradient  of  the  polar  angle  function  �(x, y) = tan−1 (y/x)  deﬁned 
over  the  right  half-plane  x > 0. 
b)  Suppose  that  C  is  a  smooth  curve  in  the  right  half-plane  x  >  0  joining  two  points 
A : (x1 , y1 )  and B  : (x2 , y2 ).  Use  the  fundamental  theorem  of  calculus  (for  line  integrals)  to 
ˆ
express 
F  · T  ds  in  terms  of  the  polar  coordinates  (r1 , �1 )  and  (r2 , �2 )  of  A  and B .  Find


C 
an  example  of  a  curve  C  in  the  right  half-plane  for  which  the  line  integral  is  −�/2. 
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
F  · T  ds and 
F  · T  ds,
c) Calculate directly  the  integrands F  · T  and  the  integrals  C1 




C2 
where  C1  is  the  upper  half  of  the  unit  circle  running  from  (1, 0)  to  (−1, 0),  and  C2  is  the 
lower  half  of  the  unit  circle,  also  going  from  (1, 0)  to  (−1, 0).

d)  Since  curl F  =  0  at  any  point  of  the  plane  where  F  is  deﬁned,  the  vector  ﬁeld  F 
ought  to  be  conservative  (path-independent).  This  is  true  in  some  regions,  but  not  in 
others.  Consider  three  regions,  the  punctured  plane  R1 ,  deﬁned  as  the  whole  plane  except 
the  origin  (0, 0),  the  slit  plane  R2 ,  deﬁned  as  the  whole  plane  except  the  negative  x-axis 
((0, x)  where  x  �  0),  and  the  right  half-plane  R3 ,  as  deﬁned  in  part  (a).  In  which  of  the 
regions R1 ,  R2 ,  and/or R3  is  F  conservative?  Even  though  F  is  not  conservative  in  one  of 
these  regions,  this  does  not  contradict  the  fundamental  theorem.  Explain. 

Problem  3.  (Tuesday;  3  points:  1 +  2) 
a)  Calculate  the  curl  of  F  = rn (x ˆı + y ˆ� ). 
b)  For  each  n  for  which  curl F  =  0,  ﬁnd  a  potential  g  such  that  F  =  �g .  (Hint:  look 
for  a  potential  of  the  form  g =  g(r).  Watch  out  for  a  certain  negative  value  of  n  for  which 
the  formula  is  diﬀerent.) 
Problem  4.  (Tuesday;  3  points:  1 +  1 +  1) 
a)  Verify  that  F  = y 2ˆı + x2 yˆ�  from  Problem  1  is  not  a  gradient  ﬁeld. 
b)  Try  to  ﬁnd  a  potential  function  by Method  1  in  Notes  V2.  What  goes wrong? 
c)  Try  to  ﬁnd  a  potential  function  by Method  2  in  Notes  V2.  What  goes  wrong?
