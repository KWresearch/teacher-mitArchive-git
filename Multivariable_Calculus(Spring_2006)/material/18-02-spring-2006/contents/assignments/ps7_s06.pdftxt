Part  B 

(47  points  +  5  extra  credit) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate, 
solutions  must  be  written  up  independently.  It  is  illegal  to  consult materials  from  previous 
semesters.  With  each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 
Problem  0.  (not  until  due  date;  5  points)  Write  the  names  of  all  the  people  you 
consulted  or with whom  you  collaborated  and  the  resources  you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no 
consultation”. 

Problem  1.  (Thursday,  5  points:  2  +  3) 
a)  Calculate  the  probability  density  of  r ,  the  distance  to  the  origin,  for  a  point  selected 
uniformly  according  to  area  in  the  disk  of  radius  10  around  the  origin.  In  other words,  ﬁnd 
�  b 
f (r)  such  that  if  0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10, 
a 

P (a < r < b) = 

f (r)dr 

(f (r)  is  called  the  probability  density  of  r ;  see  the  notes  on  probability.) 
b)  Calculate  the  probability  density  of  the  distance  from  the  origin,  r ,  for  points  (x, y) 
�  � 
selected  according  to  the  density  in  Problem  4  (PS  6  Part  B),  that  is, 
R 

P ((x, y)  in  R) = 

δ(x, y)dxdy ,

M 

where  R  is  any  portion  of  the  half­disk  y > 0,  x2  + y2  < 1,  δ(x, y) = y2 ,  and M  is  the  total 
mass  of  the  half  disk. 

Problem  2.  (Thursday,  6  points:  4  +  1  +  1) 
a)  Find  the  average  distance  between  a  point  on  the  circumference  of  a  circle  of  radius 
a  and  a  point  inside.  Assume  the  point  on  the  circumference  is  the  origin  and  the  circle 

1 

is  centered  at  (a, 0).  Set  up  the  integration  both  in  polar  coordinates  and  in  rectangular 
coordinates,  but  only  carry  out  the  computation  using  polar  coordinates. 
b)  Find  the  probability  density  of  the  distance  from  a  point  in  the  disk  of  radius  a  to  a 
point  on  the  circumference  of  the  disk. 
c)  Find  the  probability  density  of  the  cube  of  the  distance  from  a  point  in  the  disk  of 
radius  a  to  a  point  on  the  circumference  of  the  disk. 
Problem  3.  (Friday,  6  points:  4  +  2  +  extra) 
a)  Suppose  that  a  point  (x, y , z )  is  chosen  with  uniform  probability  in  the  region  0  < 
x < y < z < 1  (a  tetrahedron).  Find  the  average  value  and  probability  density  of  x. 
b)  The  probability  density  and  average  value  that  you  found  in  part  (a)  describes  the 
behavior of a number x found by the following recipe:  pick three numbers at random between 
0  and  1  and  then  choose  the  smallest  of  the  three.  What  is  your  chance  of  winning  if  you 
bet  that  the  number  obtained  is  less  than  1/2?  less  than  1/4? 
c)  Extra  credit  (5  points;  added  at  the  end  of  the  term  separately  from  al l  other  scores) 
Find  the  average  value  of  x1  if  the  point  (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )  is  chosen with  uniform  probability 
in  the  region  0 < x1  < x2  < · · · < xn  < 1  in  n­dimensional  space. 
Problem  4.  (Friday,  13  points:  4  +  3  +  6) �  1 �  1 
dxdy  in coordinates u = x, v = 2x− y
a) Change variables to express the integral 
0 
0
in  the  order  dvdu.  Draw  a  picture  of  the  region  of  integration  in  the  uv ­plane.  (Get  started 
by  ﬁnding  what  the  corners  and  sides  of  the  square  in  the  xy ­plane  correspond  to  in  the 
uv ­plane.)  Check  your  integral  to  be  sure  it  has  the  value  1. 
b)  Express  the  same  integral  in  the  order  dudv  in  three  parts.  (You  can  doublecheck 
your  answers  by  computing  each  integral  directly  in  uv  coordinates  and  in  xy ­coodinates.) 
c)  Suppose  that  two  numbers  (x, y)  is  chosen  uniformly  according  to  area  in  the  unit 
square  0 ≤ x ≤ 1,  0 ≤ y ≤ 1.  (See  Notes  on  conditional  probability.) 
i) What  is  the  conditional  probability  that  x ≤ 1/4,  given  that  2x − y2  = −1/2? 
ii) What  is  the  conditional  probability  that  x ≥ 1/2,  given  that  2x − y2  = −1/2? 
iii)  Answer  the  same  two  questions  if  2x − y2  = 1/2.

Problem  5.  (Friday,  4  points)  This  problem  is  a  classic.  Find  the  volume  of  the  solid 
formed  by  the  intersection  of  two  cylinders  of  radius  1  that meet  at  right  angles.  Make  the 
axis  of  one  of  the  cylinders  the  x­axis  and  the  other  the  y ­axis. 

Problem  6.  (Tuesday,  4  points)  Find  the  average  distance  from  a  point  of  a  solid  ball 
of  radius  a  to  a  point  on  the  surface  using  spherical  coordinates.  Put  the  point  at  South 
Pole  of  the  ball  and  use  that  point  as  the  origin. 
Problem  7.  (Tuesday,  4  points:  2  +  2)  Set  up,  but  do  not  evaluate,  integrals  in 
spherical  coordinates  for  the  following. 
a)  The  center  of  mass  of  a  solid  ice  cream  cone  with  uniform  density  δ ,  vertex  at  the 
origin,  axis  along  the  z ­axis,  height  h,  and  a  ﬂat  top  formed  by  a  disk  of  radius  a. 
b)  The  moment  of  inertia  of  a  ball  of  radius  a  with  a  cylindrical  hole  of  radius  b  bored 
through  the  center  (along  the  z )  axis.  (See  20.6/5  for  the  case  of  cylindrical  coordinates).
