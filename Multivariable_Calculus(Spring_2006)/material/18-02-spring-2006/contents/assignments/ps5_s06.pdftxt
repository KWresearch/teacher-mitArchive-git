Part  B 

(16  points) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate, 
solutions  must  be  written  up  independently.  It  is  illegal  to  consult materials  from  previous 
semesters.  With  each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 
Problem  0.  (not  until  due  date;  2  points) 
Write  the  names  of  all  the  people  you  consulted  or with whom  you  collaborated  and  the 
resources  you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no  consultation”. 

Problem  1.  (Thursday,  6  points:  2  +  4) 
a)  We  seek  a  more  precise  answer  to  PS4/Problem  6b.  Use  the  method  of  Lagrange 
multipliers  to  write  down  the  system  of  equations  satisﬁed  by  the  point  closest  to  (2, 1, 10) 
at  which  z − 2x2  − y2  = 0 
b)  Solve  the  equations  to  get  a  numerical  approximation  to  four  decimal  places  for  the 
location  of  the  point.  Compare  your  answers  with  the  approximation  in  6b.  Was  each 
coordinate  of  the  approximate  answer  in  6b within  1/100  of  the  exact  answer?  (Suggestion: 
Express  x,  y ,  z  as  a  function  of  the  Lagrange  multiplier  λ,  then  substitute  these  formulas 
into  the  constraint  equation.  After  clearing  the  denominator,  the  constraint  equation  leads 
to  the  quintic  equation  4λ5  + 92λ4  + 253λ3  + 242λ2  + a1λ + 2 = 0  —  you  ﬁnd  a1 .  Use  a 
calculator  to  solve  this  equation.  Alternatively,  in Matlab,  roots([4, 92, 253, 242, a1 , 2]) ﬁnds 
the  roots.  Decide  which  root  is  the  right  one.) 
Problem  2.  (Friday,  8  points:  4  +  2  +  2) 
a) Suppose  that  g(x, y) = c a  constant and w = f (x, y , z ).  Which of  the  following makes 
sense  as  the  derivative  ∂w/∂x?  (If  so,  compute  it  in  terms  of  the  formal  derivatives  fx ,  fy ,

fz ,  gx ,  and  gy .  If  not,  explain  why  not.)

b)  Suppose  that  sin(x + y) = 4t  and  w = xyt − 2.  Find  (∂w/∂ t)x . 
c) Consider  the  curve  of  points  (x, y , z )  satisfying  x3 − zyx = −7  and  x − y2 z + z 3  = 49. 
Use  the method  of  total  diﬀerentials  to  ﬁnd  dz/dy  at  (x, y , z ) = (1, 2, 4).
