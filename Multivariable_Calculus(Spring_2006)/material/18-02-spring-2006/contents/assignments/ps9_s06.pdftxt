Part  B 

(17  points)  

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve   each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate, 
solutions  must  be  written  up  independently.  It   is  illegal   to  consult  materials  from  previous 
semesters.  With  each  problem  is  the   day   it  can  be   done. 

Problem  0.  (not  until  due  date; 3  points)  

Write  the  names  of  all  the  people   you  consulted  or  with  whom  you  collaborated  and  the  
resources  you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no  consultation”. 

Problem  1.  (Thursday;  4   points:   2  +  2) 


R,  then  Area(R) = 

a) Show  that,  if a   simple,  closed  (positively oriented) curve  C  is  the  boundary of a  region

b) Use  this  result  to  calculate  the  area  of the  region  between  the  x-axis  and  one   arch  of 
the  cycloid  with  parametric  equations  x  =  a(t  −  sin  t),  y  =  a(1  −  cos  t). (Hint:  the  second 
line  integral  leads  to  easier  calculations.)  

x  dy  = 

−y  dx. 

Problem  2.  (Thursday;  5  points:  3  +  2)


a) For   what simple,  closed  (positively oriented) curve   C  in  the  plane  does  the   line  integral

(x 2  y  +  y  −  y ) dx  +  (3x  +  2y  2 x  +  ey ) dy  have   the  largest   positive   value?   (Use   Green’s

theorem.) 

b) Determine  what  this  value  is. 

Problem  3.  (Thursday;  5   points:  3  +  2)  Conﬁrm  Green’s  theorem  for  the  line  integral 
of  F  =  y 2ˆı +  x2 yˆj around the  loops  from  PS8,   Part   B  Problem  1. 

a)  C1  is  the  ellipse  x2  +  4y 2  = 4  traced  counterclockwise   (=   positively  oriented). 

b)  C2  is  the  triangle  in  the   ﬁrst  quadrant  formed  by  the  axes  and  the  line  x  +  y  =  a 
traced  counterclockwise.
