Part  B 

(29  points) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate, 
solutions must  be  written  up  independently.  It  is  illegal  to  consult materials  from  previous 
semesters.  With  each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 
Problem  0.  (not  until  due  date;  3  points)  Write  the  names  of  all  the  people  you 
consulted  or with  whom  you  collaborated and  the  resources you used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no 
consultation”. 

Problem  1.  (Thursday,  13  points:  2 +  1 +  4 +  1 +  2  +  3) 
a) Express the line through P0  = (x0 , y0 , z0 ) in the direction of v = �a, b, c≤ in parametric 
form  using  the  parameter �z = z − z0 ,  the  change  in  z .  What  condition  on  v  is  required  in 
order  that  this  parametric  representation  be  possible? 
b) Denote  r = �x, y , z ≤,  and �r = ��x, �y , �z ≤ = �x − x0 , y − y0 , z − z0 ≤.  Find �r/�z 
and  dr/dz  at  P0  along  the  line  in  part  (a). 
c)  Consider  the  functions  u  =  x − y + z  and  v  =  −2x + y + 3z .  Find  a  parametric 
representation  for  the  line  formed  by  the  intersection  of  the  planes  u  =  1,  v  =  2,  through 
the  point  (1, 1, 1),  and  use  the  method  of  part  (b)  to  compute

d)  What  is  the  relationship  between  the  line  in  part  (c)  and  lines  formed  by  the  inter­
section  of  planes  u  =  c1 ,  v  =  c2  for  other  values  of  c1  and  c2 ?  Use  your  answer  to  give  a 
reason why  the  answers  to  part  (c)  would  be  the  same  at  any  base  point,  not  just  (1, 1, 1). 
e)  Let  w = f (x, y , z ).  Use  the  chain  rule  to  express,  in  terms  of �w = �fx , fy , fz ≤,

intersect  in a curve  through the point P1  = (1, 2, 4).  Find  a  tangent vector at  (1, 2, 4)  to  the

curve,  and  use  it  to  compute  dw/dz  and  dw/dx  at  (x, y , z ) = (1, 2, 4)  in  terms  of �w.  How 
are  dw/dz  and  dw/dx  written  in  partial  derivative  notation? 
(Compare  your  answer  here  for  dw/dz  to  the  one  on  PS5,  Part  B/2c.  They  should  be 
the  same  if  w  =  y .  In  general,  partial  derivatives  are  ordinary  derivatives  along  curves  in 
disguise.  In  order  to  identify  the  curve,  you  need  to  specify  which  variables  are  being  held 
ﬁxed.  When  computing  any  rate  of  change you  are,  at  least  implicitly,  ﬁnding  the  direction 
of  the  curve,  as  in  part  (b)  and  (c)  of  this  problem.) 

Problem  2.  (Friday,  4  points)  The  rectangular prism  pictured  below  has  a  rectangular 
base  and  a  top  that  is  a  portion  of  the  plane  z  =  ax + by + c.  The  four  vertical  edges  can 
have  diﬀerent  lengths.  Show  by  double  integration  that 

volume  of  prism  = (area  of  base) × (average  of  the  lengths  of  vertical  edges) 

This  formula  can  be  thought  of  as  generalizing  the  formula  for  the  area  of  a  trapezoid. 

Problem  3.  (Friday,  3  points:  1 +  2)  Evaluate

b) Use part (a) to rewrite the integral you wish to evaluate as a double integral.  Evaluate 
the  double  integral  by  exchanging  the  order  of  integration. 

Problem  4.  (Tuesday,  6  points)  Compute  the  mass,  centroid,  and  moments  Ix ,  Iy  and 
I0  of  the  half-disk  y > 0,  x2  + y2  < 1  with  density  �(x, y) =  y 2 .  (Use  the  integral  formulas 
in  3B,  if  needed.)
