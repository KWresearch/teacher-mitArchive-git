Part  B 

(48  points) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate, 
solutions must  be  written  up  independently.  It  is  illegal  to  consult materials  from  previous 
semesters.  With  each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 
Problem  0.  (not  until  due  date;  4  points) 
Write  the  names  of  all  the  people you  consulted  or with whom you  collaborated and  the 
resources  you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no  consultation”. 

Problem  1.  (Thursday,  13 points:  2 +  1 +  4 +  4 +  2) Consider  the  function  f (x, y) = 
x3  − 3x2  + xy − y 2  + x + y  in  the  square  S  given  by  0 � x � 2,  0 � y � 2. 
a)  Find  the  critical  points  of  f  in  S . 
b)  Knowing  the  location  of  the  critical  points,  what  can  you  say  about  the  points  in  S 
where  f  attains  its maximum  and minimum? 
c)  Find  the  maximum  and  the  minimum  of  f  in  S  and  the  points  at  which  these  values 
are  achieved. 
d)  Classify  the  critical  points  according  to  the  second  derivative  test,  and  sketch  the 
level  curves  near  each  such  point. 
e)  What  additional  information  beyond  what  you  found  in  part  (a)  does  the  type  of 
the  critical  points  tell  you  concerning  the  location  of  the  maximum  and  the  minimum?  If 
you  had  carried  out  the  classiﬁcation  of  the  critical  points  in  part  (d)  before  part  (c),  what 
computation(s)  would  you  have  been  spared?  (Hint:  something,  but  not  much.) 
Problem  2.  (Thursday,  12  points:  3 +  1 +  4 +  4) 
a)  Use  the  contour  plot  below  to  determine  whether  fx  and  fy  are  >  0,  =  0,  or  <  0  at

through  (1 1)  is

b)  The  function  plotted  on  the  ﬁgure  is  the  function  from  Problem  1. 

f (x, y) = x(x − 1)(x − 2) + (y − 1)(x − y) = f (x, y) = x 3  − 3x  + xy − y 2  + x + y

Calculate the actual values of the partial derivatives at (1, 1/2) and (1, 1).

c) Go to the applet “Functions of two variables” on our web page. The program will load
with the function graph of the function f pictured in part (a). Read brieﬂy the directions
on the web page, and familiarize yourself with the controls. Choose “Level curves” from
the “show” menu, and move to slider to see how the highlighted contour line moves on both
the 2-D and 3-D pictures. Experiment with it in order to perfect your understanding of
the contour plot. Use the slider to locate (approximately) the critical points and maximum
and minimum points. Report all these (approximate) locations and the values of f at these
points.

d) Choose “Partial derivatives” from the menu and see how, by clicking on and moving
the point in the small contour plot you can see x- and/or y -slices of the graph. [You can use
this to check your answers to (b) and to Problem 1.] Find the two points where fx = fy = 0,
and give their approximate coordinates. What happens to the level curves of f through these
points? For each of the two points, describe what happens when you move towards North,
South, East, West: does the value of f go up, down, or does it stay exactly the same?

Problem 3. (Friday, 3 points: 1 + 2)

The electrical resistance of a piece of wire is given by the formula R = � L/S , where
the resistivity � is a constant depending only on the material, L is the length and S is the
cross-section area.

b)  The  electrical  resistance  of  a  copper  wire  of  length  100  m  and  cross-section  1  mm2 
is  equal  to  1.5  ohm.  Using  the  diﬀerential,  approximate  the  resistance  when  the  length 
becomes  105 m  and  the  cross-section becomes  1.1 mm2 .  Compare your approximation with 
the  actual  value.

Problem  4.  (Friday,  8  points  2 +  1 +  2  +  2 +  1;  See  also,  2E/5,7) 
a) Suppose  that w = w(x, y),  x = x(r, �)  and y = y(r, �).  Express the  chain rule  formula 
for  wr  and  w�  in  terms  of  wx ,  wy ,  xr ,  yr ,  x� ,  y�  in  matrix  notation:

(In  other  words,  ﬁnd  the  2 × 2  matrix  A.) 
b) Calculate A in the case of polar coordinates x = r cos �, y = r sin �, writing the entries 
of  A  as  functions  of  r  and  �. 
c)  Next  suppose  that  u  =  u(r, �).  Use  the  formulas  r  =

d) Compute A−1  using the Notes (M, page 6) and change variables to show that B = A−1 . 
e)  If  at  r = 5,  � = −�/2,  ur  = 1,  u�  = 20,  then  what  are  ux  and  uy ? 
Problem  5.  (Tuesday,  8  points:  2 +  1 +  1 +  4) 
a) Continuing with  the  same  function  f  as  in Problems 1 and  2, Find  the maximum and

  at  (1, 1/2).

b)  Say  in  which  directions  u  the  maximum  and  minimum  occur.

d)  Go  to  the  applet  and  choose  the  “Directional  derivatives”  from  the  menu.  Click  to 
move  the  point  in  the  contour  plot  as  close  as  you  can  to  (1, 1/2).  ((1.01, 1.51)  is  ok,  but 
record the actual values of x and y  that you use.)  Rotate the direction u = �cos �, sin �� and 
ﬁnd  the  numerical  values  the  applet  computes  for  df /ds  and  �  answering  questions  (a)-(c) 
above.  In  (b)  and  (c)  state  the  geometric  relationship  between  the  yellow  direction  of  the 
directional  derivative  u,  the  blue  contour  line  (f  = −1/4),  and  the  purple  gradient  vector 
on  the  contour  plot.  (The  value  of  the  directional  derivative  is  on  the  lower  right  in  red.) 
Problem  6.  (Tuesday,  5  points:  2 +  3) 
a)  Find  the  direction  from  (2, 1, 10)  in  which  g(x, y , z ) = z − 2x2  − y decreases  fastest.

b)  Follow  the  line  in  the  direction  you  found  in  part  (a)  to  estimate,  using  linear  ap­
proximation,  the  location  of  the  point  closest  to  (2, 1, 10)  at  which  g  =  0.  Do  not  use  a 
calculator.  Express your answer using fractions.  Next, use a calculator to evaluate g  at your 
point.  (The  value  should  be  reasonably  close  to  1.  Next  week,  we  will  get  a  more  precise 
answer  using  Lagrange multipliers.)
