Part  B 

(29  points) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate, 
solutions must  be  written  up  independently.  It  is  illegal  to  consult materials  from  previous 
semesters.  With  each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 
Problem  0.  (not  until  due  date;  3  points) 
Write  the  names  of  all  the  people you  consulted  or with whom you  collaborated and  the 
resources  you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no  consultation”. 

Problem  1.  (Thursday,  3  points) 

Notes  6B/7. 

Problem  2.  (Thursday,  8  points:  2,  4,  2) 
Consider a  tetrahedron with vertices at P0  = (0, 0, 0), P1  = (0, 1, 1), P2  = (0, 1, −1), and 
P3  = (1, 1, 0).  Orient  each  face  so  that  the  normal  vector  points  out  of  the  tetrahedron. 
a) For  each  of  the  four  faces, determine  geometrically  (without  calculation) whether  the 
ﬂux  of  the  vector  ﬁeld  F = xˆ�  is  positive,  negative,  or  zero. 
b)  Calculate  the  ﬂux  of  F  =  xˆ�  through  (out  of )  the  tetrahedron,  directly  from  the 
deﬁnition  of  ﬂux.  (Use  symmetry  to  reduce  the  amount  of  calculation.) 
c)  Verify  the  answer  you  found  in  part  (b)  by  using  the  divergence  theorem. 

Problem  3.  (Thursday,  6  points)  Conﬁrm  the  divergence  theorem  in  the  region  0  �

z  � 10 −  x2  + y2  for  the  vector  ﬁeld  F = xˆı + yˆ�  by  calculating  each  side  of  the  formula 
directly. 
Problem  4.  (Thursday,  9  points:  2,  1,  1,  3,  2)

A  function  u  is  called harmonic  if �2 u = 0.  (The  same notations  are used  in V15  (5)). 
We  will  prove  the mean  value  property  for  harmonic  functions:
