Part  B 

(27  points) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate,  solutions 
must  be  written  up  independently.  It  is  illegal  to  consult materials  from  previous  semesters.  With 
each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 
Problem  0.  (not  until  due  date;  4  points) 
Write the names of all the people you consulted or with whom you collaborated and the resources 
you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no  consultation”. 

Problem  1.  (Friday  3  points)  Let  f  be  the  height  function  on  the  map  on  the  next  page,  of 
part  of  the  Presidential  range  in  the  White  Mountains  of  New  Hampshire.  Pretending  that  the 
mountains  are  smooth  rather  than  rough  and  irregular,  estimate  the  value  fx  and  fy  at  the  point 
on  the  contour  line  half  way  between  the  “O”  in  Osgood  and  the  “o”  Howker.  The  scale  is  2000 
feet  per  inch  and  the  contour  lines  are  at  100  foot  intervals.  Use  these  (very  approximate)  values 
of  fx  and  fy  to  estimate  the  direction  of  steepest  ascent  in  degrees  counterclockwise  from  north, 
the  vertical  direction  on  the  map.

Problem  2.  (Thursday, Feb  23,  6 points:  2+1+1+1+1) This problem  is designed  to  introduce 
you  to  Matlab,  which  is  a  standard  computational  tool  in  many  courses  and  engineering  and 
consulting  ﬁrms. 
An  economist  modeling  the  ISP  wars  in  the  early  21st  century  has  for  convenience  divided  up 
the companies into four components:  AOL, EarthLink, MSN, and Other.com (1stUp.com, NetZero, 
Prodigy,  AT&T Worldnet,  Freei.Net,  Juno,  etc,  etc,  etc). 
The entries xi  of the column vector x = [x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ]�  represent the market share  in millions of 
subscribers of the  four “companies”  listed above  in order;  for example x2  = 4 means  that Earthlink 
has  4  million  subscribers. 
Suppose  that  after  one  year,  as  a  result  of  consumer  swiching,  50%  of  AOL  customers  have 
remained loyal, 10% of of Earthlink customers have switched to AOL as have 5% of MSN customers 
and  15%  of  others.  If  y1 ,  y2 ,  y3  and  y4  represent  market  shares  after  one  year,  then  we  can  write 
y1  = .5x1  + .1x2  + .05x3  + .15x4 
Assuming  various  switching  rates  among  brands,  we  get  a  matrix  equation 
y = M x 
which  we  will  write —  changing  the  names  of  the  column  vectors  –  as 
(1)  = M x(0)
x
(The  original  market  share  vector  x  is  labelled  as  x(0) ,  and  we  change  y  to  x(1)  to  show  that  it 
represents  the  new  value  of  x  after  one  year.)  Let’s  say  that  our  economist,  on  the  basis  of  data

We are supposing  for simplicity that the  total number subscribers stays  the same — a zero­sum 
game  for  the  ISPs. 
Assume  that  the  switching  matrix  remains  the  same  year  after  year,  so  that  x(2)  = 
M x(1) ,
x(3)  =  M x(2) ,  and  so  on.  The  column  vector  x(n)  summarizes  the  number  of  subscribers  after  n 
years.  The  initial market shares  in  the year 2000 are x1  = 22, x2  = 4, x3  = 2.6, and x4  = 25.  Using 
Matlab  (instructions  on  page  5), 
a)  Calculate  x(n)  for  n = 1,  2,  8  using M ˆn  (round  to  two  decimal  places). 
b) What  are  the  ﬁnal  market  shares  after  many  years  have  gone  by?  (rounded  to  two  decimal 
places)  What  is  the  ﬁrst  year  in  which  these  ﬁnal  market  shares  appear?  (to  within  100,000 
subscribers) 
c) Pretend instead that all 53.6 million subscribers started with Earthlink.  What will the market 
shares  be  after many  years? 
d)  Explain  brieﬂy  why  the  columns  of M  all  have  1  as  their  sum. 
e)  How  would  you  modify  this  model  to  take  into  account  nonsubscribers?  (Be  brief;  don’t 
complicate matters  by worrying  about  households with more  than  one  service  or  about  population 
growth.) 
Problem  3.  (Friday  3  points:  2+1)  Assume  that  b2  − 4c > 0  so  that  x2  + bx + c = 0  has  two 
roots.  Let  r  denote  the  larger  root.  Then  r  is  a  function  of  b  and  c. 
a)  Give  an  approximate  formula  for  the  small  change  Δr  in  the  value  of  r  produced  by  small 
changes  Δb  and  Δc  in  the  coeﬃcients.  Use  this  to  calculate  an  approximate  value  for  the  larger 
root  of  the  equation  x2  − 7.01x + 11.98 = 0. 
b)  Starting  from  the  equation  x2  − 7x + 12 = 0,  is  r  more  sensitive  to  small  changes  in  b  or  c? 
(Give  a  reason.) 

Problem  4.  (Tuesday,  11  points:  2+0+3+2+3+1)  –  Least  squares  and  data  analysis. 
a)  Parts  (b)­(f )  of  this  problem  will  involve  the  use  of  Matlab.  Before  going  to  the  terminal, 
study LS and do  the  following.  Let x = [x1  x2  . . . xn ], y = [y1  y2  . . . yn ] and u =  [1 1 . . . 1]  (n ones). 
Let  y = ax + b  be  the  best­ﬁtting  line  for  the  n  points  (xi , yi ).  Translate  LS  (4)  into  a  single  2 × 2 
matrix  equation 
z = [a, b]� 
Az = r , 
� 
Write the entries of A and r  in Matlab­ready form.  Don’t use summations, instead use, for example, 
x ∗ u� 
for
xi . 
You  will  be  able  to  conﬁrm  that  your  formulas  are  correct  by  testing  them  on  a 
concrete  example  using Matlab  in  part  (c). 
b)  The  following  data 

x  = 
y  = 

[94, 97, 100, 104, 109, 112, 115, 118, 121, 125] 
[2353, 2601, 2781, 3169, 3547, 3947, 4649, 5050, 5865, 6583]

are  taken  from World  Health  Organization  statistics  about  the  cumulative  number  of  SARS  cases 
reported  (worldwide)  from  the  beginning  of  the  epidemic  to  a  given  date,  over  the  period  from 
April  4  to  May  5,  2003  (source:  http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/en/).  The  variable  x 
represents  the  number  of  days  since  the  beginning  of  the  year,  and  the  variable  y  represents  the 
total  number  of  cases  reported  to  that  date.  Look  at  the Matlab  directions  for  plotting  at  the  end 
of  this problem  set and make a  scatter plot of  these data points marked with ∗’s.  (Nothing  to hand 
in;  you  will  do  this  over  again  with  part  (d).) 
c)  Use  Matlab,  the  data  from  (b)  and  the  formulas  you  found  in  part  (a)  to  ﬁnd  the  best  line 
y = ax + b ﬁtted  to  the points.  Compute  the diﬀerence between  the actual value of  the data y  with 
the  predicted  value  y = ax + b.  Report  a,  b  and  the  worst  case  (largest  error). 
(Optional,  but  recommended:  check  that  your  answer  for  a  and  b  agrees  with  the  Matlab 
operation  polyﬁt(x,y,1),  which  computes  the  coeﬃcients  of  the  best  polynomial  of  degree  1  ﬁtting 
the  data  x  and  y .  If  c = polyﬁt(x, y , 1)  then  c = [a, b] = z �  is  the  transpose  of  the  column  vector 
z  in  part  (a).  In  this  way  you  can  conﬁrm  that  you  did  part  (a)  correctly.) 
d)  In  its  initial  phase,  an  epidemic  usually  spreads  exponentially,  not  linearly.  Use  Matlab  to 
ﬁnd  the  best  ﬁt  of  the  form  log(y) = a1x + b1 .  (Use  natural  log,  not  log  in  base  10.)  Report  your 
values  of  a1 ,  b1 .  If  you  exponentiate  this  equation,  you  get 

a1 x 
y = e b1 e 

Compute the diﬀerence between y  and the predicted value according to this  formula and report the 
worst  case  (largest  error). 
e)  Hand  in  a  printout  that  shows  on  the  same  plot:  the  scatter  plot  of  (x, y)  labelled  with  ∗’s, 
the straight line ﬁt, (x, ax + b) as a dashed line, and the curve (x, eb1 ea1 x ), connected by an ordinary 
line. 
f )  According  to  the  exponential  best  ﬁt,  how  many  cases  were  there  on  January  1,  2003?  (the 
order  of  magnitude  is  realistic).  How  many  cases  would  there  have  been  on  July  1,  2003  if  the 
epidemic  had  remained  out  of  control?  On  December  31,  2003?  (fortunately,  the  epidemic  was 
successfully  contained  and  the  total  number  of  cases  stabilized  around  8400).

Matlab


Matlab  calculates  with  matrices  and  vectors  and  draws  graphs  in  2D  and  3D.  Skip  the  Intro­
duction  and  Help  documents;  as  preliminary  practice,  just  read  and  carry  out  the  following. 
Entering  matrices  and  vectors.  In  Matlab  the  variables  represent  matrices  and  vectors. 
The  symbol  =  assigns  the  value  on  the  right  side  of  the  equation  to  the  symbol  on  the  left.  Type 
each  of  these  lines  in  order,  and  see what  you  get.  (Always  hit  [return]  to  end  a  line  or  command.) 
(you  can  use  commas  instead  of  spaces:  1,2,3;) 

A  =  [1  2  3;  4  5  6;  7  8  9] 
b  =  [5  2  1] 
(transpose:  gives  the  column  vector  which  Matlab  cal ls  [5;2;1]) 
b’ 
(eye  =  I,  the  identity  matrix) 
eye(3) 
Try  making  a  mistake:  C  =  [1,2,3;  4,5].  To  edit  the  mistake,  press  any  of  the  four  arrow 
keys  to get  the  line back.  (You  can also prepare your  commands  in a  text  editor  such as  emacs and 
copy  them  with  the  mouse  onto  the Matlab  command  line.) 
Operations  with  matrices  and  vectors

Array  operations.  Recall  that  *  and  ^  are  product  and  power  operations  for  matrices.  Adding 
a  dot  before  *  or  ^  makes  these  operations  act  component­wise.  So,  if  x = [x1  x2  . . .  xn],  then 
exp(x)  =  [exp(x1 )  . . .  exp(xn )]  (similarly  with  sin,  cos,  log,  etc.)

x+y  =  [x1  + y1  . . .  xn  + yn]  (similarly  with  ­)

x.*y  =  [x1y1  . . .  xnyn]

(m  can  be  zero) 
m

x.^m  =  [x
. . .  xn  ]

Colon  operator.  This  generates  a  vector  with  equally  spaced  entries;  for  example, 
[2  : −.1 : 1.6] = [2.0  1.9  1.8  1.7  1.6] 
[0  : 2  : 12] = [0  2  4  6  8  10  12]; 
2D  plot  directions.  Given  x = [x1  x2  . . .  xn ],  y = [y1  . . .  yn ]  , 
plot(x, y)  plots  the  n  points  (xi , yi ),  joined  by  solid  line  segments. 
plot(x, y ,� −−� )  plots  the  n  points,  joined  by  dashed  line  segments. 
plot(x, y ,� ∗� )  plots  the  n  points  as  individual  stars  (or  dots  or  circles,  etc). 
hold  toggles between on and oﬀ (at the start  it’s oﬀ ); when oﬀ, a new plot erases the previous 
one;  when  on,  the  new  plot  is  superimposed  on  the  old  one. 
print  gives  a  print­out  of  the  current  screen  plot. 
Try  in  order  (press  [return]  after  each  command): 
x=[0:.1:2]

plot(x,sin(x))

plot(x,cos(x),’*’)

hold

plot(x,sin(x),’­­’)

hold

(this  plots  y = 4x3 ;  note  the  need  for  the  array  operator)

plot(x,4*x.^3) 
You  can  also  put  graphs  and  scatter  plots  together  without  the  hold  command.  The  commands 
below graph the three functions 10x, 10x1/2 , 2x5/3 .  (With the semicolon at the end of each command 
Matlab won’t  print  out  all  the  numbers.  The  semicolon  also  permits  you  to  put  several  commands 
on  one  line.) 

x  =  [2:40:400]; 
w  =  [1:1:500]; 
plot(x,10*x,  ’*’,w,b,w,c,  ’­­’);


b  =  10*(w.ˆ.5); 

c  =  2*(w.ˆ(5/3));
