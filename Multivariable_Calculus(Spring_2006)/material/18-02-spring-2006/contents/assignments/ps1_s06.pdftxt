Part  B 

(56  points) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate,  solutions 
must  be written  up  independently.  It  is  illegal  to  consult materials  from  previous  semesters.  With 
each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 

Problem  0.  (not  until  due  date;  4  points) 

This  question  will  be  assigned  with  every  problem  set.  The  purpose  of  this  exercise  is  to  make 
sure  that  you  acknowledge  (to  yourself  as  well  as  others)  what  kind  of  help  you  require  and  to 
encourage  you  to  pay  attention  to  how  you  learn  best  (with a  tutor,  in a  group,  alone).  It will  help 
us  by  letting  us  know  what  resources  you  use. 

Write the names of all the people you consulted or with whom you collaborated and the resources 
you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no  consultation”.  This  includes  visits  outside  recitation  to  your 
recitation  instructor.  If  you  don’t  know  a  name,  you  must  nevertheless  identify  the  person,  as  in, 
“tutor  in  Room  2-106”,  “the  student  next  to  me  in  recitation.”  Optional:  note  which  of  these 
people  or  resources,  if  any,  were  particularly  helpful  to  you. 

Problem  1.  (Tuesday,  5  points:  2+1+2)


The  eight  vertices  of  a  cube  centered  at  (0, 0, 0)  of  sidelength  2  are  at  (±1, ±1, ±1).

a)  Find  the  four  vertices  of  the  cube,  starting  with  (1, 1, 1),  that  form  a  regular  tetrahedron.

Conﬁrm  your  answer  by  ﬁnding  the  length  of  an  edge  and  explaining  why  all  edges  have  the  same 
length. 

b)  Find  the  angle  between  two  adjacent  edges  (sharing  a  common  vertex)  of  the  tetrahedron. 

c)  (On  Thursday)  Find  the  angle  between  two  adjacent  faces  of  the  tetrahedron  (sharing  a 
common  edge).  The  angle  between  two  faces  is  known  as  a  dihedral  angle. 

Problem  2.  (Thursday,  11  points:  3+2+3+3) 

a) Find the vector equation  for the set of points Q in the plane through the point A with normal 
N ,  and  ﬁnd  the  distance  between  parallel  planes  P  and  P �  with  normal N  through  A  and A � . 
b)  In  part  (a),  let  N  = 1, 2, 1→,  A  =  (0, −2, 1),  A �  =  (1, 1, 0).  Write  the  equation  for  each  of 
�
the  planes  P  and  P �  in  the  form  ax + by + cz  = d  and  ﬁnd  the  distance  between  them. 
c)  Consider  the  line  L  in  3-space  through  the  points  B 1  and  B2  and  the  line  L�  through  the 
points  B �  and  B2
� .  If  the  lines  are  not  parallel  but  do  not  meet,  they  are  called  skew.  Assuming
1 
the  lines  are  skew,  ﬁnd  vector  formulas  for  parallel  planes  P  and  P �  containing  L  and  L� . 

2 

d)  Find  the  planes  P  and  P �  in  part  (c)  in  the  case  B1  =  (1, − 1, 0),  B2  =  (1, 2, − 1),  B �  = 
1 
(0, 3, − 1),  B �  =  (4, 0, 1).  Then  use  the  preceding  parts  to  ﬁnd  the  (nearest)  distance  between 
2 
points  on  the  two  lines  L and  L � . 

Problem  3.  (Thursday,  10  points:  5+5)  Do  you  see  red? 
The  ray  from  a  point  Q0  in  the  unit  direction  u  is  the  set  of  points  Q such  that  −−� 
Q0Q =  tu, 
t > 0.  (It  is  also  legal  to  write  this  equation  as  Q =  Q 0  + tu.)  Suppose  you  are  wearing  virtual 
reality  headgear  at  position  Q0 .  If  you  look  in  the  direction  u,  then  you  see  the  ﬁrst  ob ject  you 
meet  along  the  ray  Q0  + tu,  that  is,  the  point  with  the  least  t  >  0.  The  collection  of  all  unit 
directions  u  forms  a  sphere.  When  viewed  from  Q 0 ,  a  plane  P  looks  like  a  hemisphere.  In  other 
words,  the  family  of  directions  u  for  which  the  ray  Q + tu  meets  P  is  a  hemisphere  in  the  sphere 
of  all  unit  directions  u. 

a)  Suppose  that  the  universe  has  two  ob jects  in  it,  namely,  the  plane  P  from  2(d)  colored 
red  and  the  plane  P �  colored  blue.  What  do  you  see  from  the  point  Q0 ?  First  describe  in  words 
(geometrically)  what  happens.  Split  into  cases  according  to  where  Q 0  is  and  say  whether  you 
see  a  blue  hemisphere,  a  red  one,  both,  neither,  etc.  Then  describe  these  hypotheses  on  Q 0  and 
conclusions  about  what  u  you  see  in  terms  of  vector  inequalities  (not  coordinate  formulas).  For 
extra  credit,  discuss  what  you  see  in  the  exceptional  cases  in  which  the  point  Q 0  is  on  one  of  the 
planes. 
b) Next  consider  a  universe  in which  the  only  two  ob jects  are  the  lines  L and L �  of  2(d).  What 
do  L and  L�  look  like  from  a  given  point  of  view  Q0 ?  First  describe  in  words  (geometrically)  what 
each  line  looks  like  in  the  sphere  of  directions  u.  Then  give  a  set  of  rules  to  decide  whether,  from 
the  point  of  view  of  Q0 ,  L and  L�  cross  and,  if  so,  which  one  is  in  front.  Carry  this  out  explicitly 
from  three  viewpoints:  Q0  = (1, 0, 0),  Q1  = (5, 10, − 10),  and  Q2  = (1/100, 0, 0). 

4.  (Friday,  8pts;  2+2+2+2)  Rotations 

 

A�  = 

cos �  − sin � 
sin � 
cos � 

a)  In  2-dimensional  space,  rotations  are  given  by 
 
�


Find  u = A� ˆi  and  v = A� jˆ and  draw  a  picture  of  u  and  v  for  � = �/3. 
b) Use  the  addition  formulas  for  sine  and  cosine  to  deduce  that A �1 A�2  = A�1 +�2 .  Say  in words 
what  this  matrix  formula  means  about  rotations.  (Unlike  many  matrices,  these  two-dimensional 
rotations  do  commute:  A�1 A�2  = A�2 A�1 .) 
c)  Calculate  A−1  by  the  formula  on  page  6  of M  in  the  Notes. 
� 
d)  Give  a  geometric  reason  (in  terms  of  the  idea  of  a  rotation)  why  A−1  =  A−� .  You  found 
� 
a  diﬀerent-looking  formula  for  A−1  in  part  (c).  The  fact  that  the  two  formulas  are  equal  implies 
� 
what  properties  of  the  sine  and  cosine  functions? 

5.  (Friday,  10pts;  4  +  6)  Orthogonal  matrices 

 
�
�
Recall  from 1F/9  that  orthogonal matrices  are matrices A that  satisfy  the  identity A 
= I 
AT
(I  is  the  identity  matrix).  An  equivalent  deﬁnition  of  the  orthogonal  matrix  property  is  that 
 
 
�
�
AT  A =  I because  the  left  and  right  inverses  of  a  square  matrix  are  the  same;  see  1G/9b.)  The 

 

3


equation  AAT  =  I  says  that  the  rows  of  A  are  perpendicular  to  each  other  and  of  unit  length, 
whereas  the  equation  AT A = I  says  that  the  columns  of  A  are  perpendicular  to  each  other  and  of 
unit  length. 

The geometric signiﬁcance of orthogonal matrices is that multiplication by an orthogonal matrix 
preserves  lengths  of  vectors  and  the  absolute  values  of  angles  between  them: 

| 
�  (Av , Aw) =  �  (v , w)
|Av =  v and

There  are  two  types  of  orthogonal  matrices,  rotations  and  reﬂections. 
a)  Find  the  four  orthogonal  2 × 2  matrices  with  ﬁrst  entry  a 11  = 1/�2.  Hint:  Try  diﬀerent 
signs.  (See  1F-9  and  1F-10.) 
b)  Next  to  each  of  the  four matrices,  list  the  following 

i)  a  picture  of  what  the  matrix  does  to  the  letter  F , 

ii)  whether  this  is  a  rotation  or  a  reﬂection, 

iii)  the  determinant  of  the matrix 

What  is  the  pattern? 

6.  (Tuesday  8pts;  1,  5,  2)  Consider  the  system  of  equations 

− 
y 
2x
= 1
x  +  y  + 3z  = 1 
+ 2z  = 0 
x 

a) Write  the  system  in matrix  form. 

b)  Find  the  inverse  of  the matrix  following  the method  of minors,  and  solve  the  equation  using 
this  inverse  matrix. 

c)  Solve  the  system  directly  using  subsitution.
