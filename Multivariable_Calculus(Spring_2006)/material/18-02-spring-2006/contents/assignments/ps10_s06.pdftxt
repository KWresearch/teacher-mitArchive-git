18.02  Problem   Set  10  Spring  2006 

Due  Thursday 4/27/06,  12:55  pm 

Part  A 

(15  points)  

Hand  in  the  underlined problems  only; the  others  are  for  more  practice. 

Lecture  28.  Fri  Apr  21 
Read:  Notes  V3,  V4. 
Work:  4E/  1ac,  2,  3,  4,  5;  4F/4. 

Flux,  normal  form  of  Green’s  theorem. 

(In  4E/4,  orienting  C  clockwise  means  the  normal  ˆn  points  into   the  square.  In  4E/5,  don’t  
use   Green’s  theorem.) 

Lecture  29.  Tue  Apr  25 
Read:  Notes  V8,  V9. 
Work:  6A/ 1,  2,  3,  4; 6B/ 1,  2,  3,  4,  6,  8. 

Vector  ﬁelds  in  3D;  surface   integrals  and  ﬂux. 

(There  is  a  misprint  in  Notes  V9:  the  formula  on  page  5  should  have  the   label  (13�)  not  
(13),  and  likewise  in  the   answer  to  6B/6.)  

Part  B 

(22  points)  

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve   each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate, 
solutions  must  be  written  up  independently.  It   is  illegal   to  consult  materials  from  previous 
semesters.  With  each  problem  is  the   day   it  can  be   done. 

Problem  0.  (not  until  due  date; 4  points)  

Write  the  names  of  all  the  people  you  consulted  or  with  whom  you  collaborated  and  the  
resources  you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no  consultation”. 

Problem  1.  (Friday,  9  points:  3  +  1  +  3  +   2) Here  is  a  proof  of  the  formulas  in  3B 
using Green’s  theorem.

sin 2n  θdθ.  Prove  the   recurrence   formula


a) Deﬁne  An  = 

2π


An  = 

2n  −  1 
2n 

An−1 

(*)  

by  writing   Green’s  theorem  in  normal  form  for  the  vector  ﬁeld  F  =  y 2n−1 j  in  the   unit  disk 
x2  +  y 2  <  1  and  evaluating  each  of the   integrals  separately. (Use  polar  coordinates,  but   do 
not  use  the  formula  at  the  top  of  3B.) 

b)  Compute  A0  and  derive,  using  (*),  the   formula   for  An . (Compare   with  3B  to  make  
sure   you  have  it  right.  Remember  that  the  integrals  there  are  from  0  to  π/2,  not   2π .)

c)  Find  and  prove  a   recurrence   formula  similar  to  (*)  for  Bn  = 

sin 2n+1  θdθ  using the  

π 

half-disk  y >  0,  x2  +  y 2  <  1  and  the  vector  ﬁeld  G  =  y 2n j . 

d)  Compute  B0  and  use  the  recurrence   in  (c)   to  ﬁnd  the  formula  for  Bn  .  We  used  the 
half  disk  instead  of  the  disk  in  part  (c).  It   would  have  been  easier  to  derive   the   recurrence

sin 2n+1  θdθ  using  the  whole  disk.  But  this  is  useless.  Why?

Problem  2.  (Tuesday;  4  points:  2  +   2)  

a)  What   percentage,  rounded  to  the   nearest  percent,   of  the  Earth’s  surface  is  south  of 
Rio   de  Janeiro?   The   latitude  there   is  23  S,  that   is,  23◦  south  of  the   Equator. 

b)  Find  the  average   latitude  of  all   points  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere.  Our  latitude  in 
Boston  is  42◦  .  Are  we  above  or   below   average?   Optional:  Identify  a  city  whose  latitude   is 
within  one  degree  of  the   average. 

Problem  3.  (Tuesday;  5  points)  Compute  the   ﬂux  of  F  =  xi  +  yj  +  zk  out   of  the  
cylinder  x2  +  y < a2 ,  0  ≤  z ≤  1  directly  from  the   deﬁnition  of  ﬂux.  (Do   not  use  the 
2
divergence  theorem,  which  we  will  learn  soon.)
