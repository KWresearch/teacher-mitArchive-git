wx  =  −6x  − 4y  +  16  = 0	
4x  +  2y  +  12   = 0  ⇒

wy  =  −4x  − 2y  − 12 = 0 
Therefore  there   is  just   one   critical  point  at  (−20,  34).  Since

wxxwyy  − wxy  = (−6) (−2) − (−4)2  = 12  − 16  =  −4  <  0, 
2 
the  critical  point   is  a  saddle  point.

x  =  −20 
y  = 34 

b)  There  is  no  critical   point  in   the  ﬁrst  quadrant,  hence  the  maximum  must  be   at  inﬁnity  or  on 
the  boundary  of   the  ﬁrst  quadrant. 

The   boundary  is  composed   of  two  half-lines: 
•	 x  = 0  and  y  ≥ 0  on  which  w  =  −y2  − 12y .  It  has  a  maximum  (w  = 0)  at  y  = 0. 
=  0  and  x  ≥ 0,   where   w  =  −3x2  +  16x. (The  graph  is  a  parabola   pointing  downwards). 
•  y 
Maximum:  wx  =  −6x  +  16  = 0 
w  =  −3(8/3)2  +  16  8/3  = 64/3  >  0. ⇒
x  = 8/3.  Hence  w  has  a  maximum  at  (8/3,  0)  and 
·
We  now  check  that  the  maximum   of  w  is  not  at  inﬁnity: 
•  If  y  ≥ 0  and  x  → +∞ then  w  ≤ −3x2  +  16x,  which  tends  to  −∞ as  x 
→ +∞
.
•  If  0  ≤ x  ≤ C  and  y  → +∞,  then  w  ≤ −y2  +  16C ,  which  tends  to  −∞ as  y  → +∞. 
We  conclude  that   the  maximum   of  w  in  the  ﬁrst  quadrant  is  at  (8/3,  0).

Problem  4.  a)  

Problem  5.  a)   f (x,  y ,   z ) =  x; the  constraint  is  g(x,  y ,  z ) =   x4  + y4  + z 4  + xy + yz  + zx  = 6. The 
Lagrange   multiplier  equation  is: 
⎧ ⎨ 
1 =  λ(4x3  +  y  +  z ) 
0 =  λ(4y3  +  x  +  z )
⎩  0 =  λ(4z 3  +  x  +  y) 
b)  The  level   surfaces   of  f  and  g  are  tangent  at  (x0 ,  y0 ,  z0 ),  so  they have  the  same  tangent  plane. 
The  level  surface  of  f  is  the  plane  x  =  x0 ; hence  this  is  also  the  tangent  plane  to  the  surface  g  = 6 
at  (x0 ,  y0 ,  z0 ).

Problem  6. 
a)  Taking  the  total   diﬀerential  of  x2  + y − z 4  = 1,  we  get:  2x  dx + 3y2  dy − 4z 3  dz  = 0. Similarly, 
3
from  z 3  +  zx  +  xy  = 3,  we  get:  (y  +  z ) dx  +  x  dy  +  (3z 2  +  x) dz  = 0. 
b) At  (1,  1,  1)   we  have:   2 dx  +  3 dy  − 4 dz  = 0  and  2 dx  +  dy  +  4 dz  =  0.   We  eliminate  dz  (by 
adding  these  two  equations):  4 dx  +  4 dy   = 0,  so  dy  =  −dx,  and  hence  dy/dx  =  −1.
