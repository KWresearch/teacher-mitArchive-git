1.  Let  ( ¯ y)  be  the  center  of  mass  of  the  triangle,  with  vertices  at  (−2, 0), 
x, ¯
(0, 1),  (2, 0)  and  uniform  density  � = 1. 
a) Write an integral  formula for  ¯y .  Do not evaluate the integral(s),  but write 
explicitly  the  integrand  and  limits  of  integration. 
b)  Find  ¯x. 

2.  Find  the  polar  moment  of  inertia  of  the  unit  disk  with  density  equal  to

3.  Let  F =  (ax2 y + y3  + 1)i + (2x3  + bxy2  + 2)j  be  a  vector  ﬁeld,  where  a 
and  b  are  constants. 
a)  Find  the  values  of  a  and  b  for  which  F  is  conservative. 
b)  For  these  values  of  a  and  b,  ﬁnd  f (x, y)  such  that  F = �f .

7.  Consider  the  region  R  enclosed  by  the  x-axis,  x = 1  and  y = x 3 . 
Travelling  in  a  counterclockwise  direction  along  the  boundary  C  or  R,  call 
C1  the  portion  of C  that  goes  from  (0, 0)  to  (0, 1),  C 2  the  portion  that  goes 
from  (1, 0)  to  (1, 1)  and  C3  the  portion  that  goes  from  (1, 1)  to  (0, 0). 
a)  Find  the  total  work  of  F =  (1 + y 2 )i  around  the  boundary  C  of  R,  in  a 
counterclockwise  direction. 
b)  Calculate  the  work  of  F  along  C1  and C2 .
