c)  In  the  matrix  A,  replace  the  entry  2  in  the  upper­right  corner  by  c.  Find  a  value  of  c  for 
which  the  resulting matrix M  is  not  invertible. 
For  this  value  of  c the  system  M X  =  0  has  other  solutions  than  the  obvious  one  X  =  0:  ﬁnd 
such  a  solution  by  using  vector  operations.  (Hint:  call  U ,  V  and  W  the  three  rows  of  M ,  and 
observe  that M X = 0  if  and  only  if  X  is  orthogonal  to  the  vectors  U ,  V  and W .) 
Problem  4.  (15  points) 
The top extremity of a ladder of length L rests against a vertical wall, while the bottom is being 
pulled  away.  Find  parametric  equations  for  the  midpoint  P  of  the  ladder,  using  as  parameter  the 
angle  θ  between  the  ladder  and  the  horizontal  ground.
