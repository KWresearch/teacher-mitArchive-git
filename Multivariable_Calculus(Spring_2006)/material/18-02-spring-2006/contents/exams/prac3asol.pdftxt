b)  fx  = 6x2 y  +  y +  1  =�  f  = 2x3 y  +  xy3  +  x  +  c(y).  Therefore,

fy  = 2x3 + 3xy2 + c� (y).  Setting this equal to N , we have 2x3 + 3xy2 + c� (y) = 
2x3  + 3xy2  + 2  so  c� (y) = 2  and  c = 2y  (+constant).  In  all,

b) For  the work  through C1 ,  we  have  F · i = 1 + y 2  = 1 + 0 = 1.  The  length 
of  C1  is  1,  so  the  total  work  through  C1  is  1. 
The work  through  C2  is  zero  because  F · j = 0.
