Problem  2.  a)  Find  the  mass M  of  the  upper  half  of  the  annulus, 
y
1 < x2  + y2  < 9  (y � 0)  with  density  � = 
x2  + y2 . 
b)  Express  the  x-coordinate  of  the  center  of  mass,  x,  as  an  iterated  integral.  (Write 
¯
explicitly  the  integrand  and  limits  of  integration.)  Without  evaluating  the  integral,  explain 
why  ¯x = 0. 

Problem  3.  a)  Show  that  F = (3x2  − 6y2)ˆi + (−12xy + 4y)jˆ is  conservative.

Problem  5.  Consider  the  rectangle  R  with  vertices  (0, 0),  (1, 0),  (1, 4)  and  (0, 4).  The 
boundary  of  R  is  the  curve  C ,  consisting  of  C1 ,  the  segment  from  (0, 0)  to  (1, 0),  C2 ,  the 
segment  from  (1, 0)  to  (1, 4),  C3  the  segment  from  (1, 4)  to  (0, 4)  and  C4  the  segment  from 
(0, 4)  to  (0, 0).  Consider  the  vector  ﬁeld 
F = (cos x sin y)ˆi + (xy + sin x cos y)jˆ
a)  Find  the  work  of  F  along  the  boundary  C  oriented  in  a  counterclockwise direction. 
b)  Is the  total work along C1 , C2  and C3 , more than,  less than or equal to the work along 
C ? 

Problem  6.  Find  the  volume  of  the  region  enclosed  by  the  plane  z = 4  and  the  surface 
z = (2x − y)2  + (x + y − 1)2 . 
Suggestion:  change  of  variables.
