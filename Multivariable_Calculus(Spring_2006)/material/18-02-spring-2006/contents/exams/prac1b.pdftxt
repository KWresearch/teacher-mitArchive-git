Problem  1. 
Let P , Q and R be the points at 1 on the x-axis,  2 on the y -axis and 3 on the z -axis,  respectively.

a)  (6)  Express  QP  and  QR  in  terms  of ˆi,  jˆ and  ˆk. 
b)  (9)  Find  the  cosine  of  the  angle  P QR. 
Problem  2.  Let  P  = (1, 1, 1),  Q = (0, 3, 1)  and  R = (0, 1, 4). 
a)  (10)  Find  the  area  of  the  triangle  P QR. 
b)  (5)  Find  the  plane  through  P ,  Q  and R,  expressed  in  the  form  ax + by + cz  = d. 
c)  (5)  Is  the  line  through  (1, 2, 3)  and  (2, 2, 0)  parallel  to  the  plane  in  part  (b)?  Explain  why  or 
why  not. 
Problem  3.  A  ladybug  is  climbing  on  a  Volkswagen  Bug  (=  VW).  In  its  starting  position,  the 
the  surface of  the VW  is  represented by  the unit semicircle  x 2 + y2  = 1,  y � 0  in the  xy -plane.  The 
road  is  represented  as  the  x-axis.  At  time  t = 0  the  ladybug  starts  at  the  front  bumper,  (1, 0),  and 
walks  counterclockwise  around  the  VW  at  unit  speed  relative  to  the  VW.  At  the  same  time  the 
VW  moves  to  the  right  at  speed  10. 
a)  (15) Find the parametric  formula  for  the tra jectory  of  the  ladybug, and ﬁnd its position when 
it  reaches  the  rear  bumper.  (At  t = 0,  the  rear  bumper  is  at  (−1, 0).) 
b) (10) Compute the speed of the bug, and ﬁnd where it  is  largest and smallest.  Hint:  It is easier 
to  work  with  the  square  of  the  speed.
