Problem  2. 

(a)	 Py  = 0 = Qx  (compatible).

Pz  = ax = Rx  = 2x  =→  a = 2.

Qz  = −2bz = Ry− = −2z  =→  b = 1.

ANSWER:  a = 2,  b = 1.


(b)	 fx  = 2xz  =→  f  = x2 z + g(y , z ) =→

fy  = gy  = −1 − z 2  =→  g = −y − yz 2  + h(z ).  Therefore,  f  = x2 z − y − yz 2  + h(z ).

fz  = x2  − 2yz + h� (z ) = x2  − 2yz + 4  =→  h�  = 4  =→  h = 4z (+const).

f  = x 2 z − y − yz 2  + 4z (+const)
