The  reason why  one knows  that  ¯
x = 0 without  computation  is  that x  is  odd with  respect 
to the y -axis whereas the region and  the density are symmetric with respect to  the y -axis: 
(x, y) � (−x, y)  preserves  the  half  annulus  and  �(x, y) = �(−x, y).

3.  a) Nx  = −12y = My ,  hence  F  is  conservative. 
b)  fx  = 3x2  − 6y2  →  f  =  x3  − 6y2x + c(y)  →  fy  =  −12xy + c� (y) =  −12xy + 4y .  So 
c� (y) = 4y ,  thus  c(y) = 2y 2 
(+  constant).  In  conclusion

c)  The  curve  C  starts  at  (1, 0)  and  ends  at  (1, 1),  therefore

b)  On  C4 ,  F = sin y  i,  whereas  dr  is  parallel  to  j.  Hence  F · dr = 0.  Therefore  the  work
