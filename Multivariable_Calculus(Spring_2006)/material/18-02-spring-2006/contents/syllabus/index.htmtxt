***** Homework *****
There are twelve problem sets.
Collaboration on problem sets is encouraged, but
    * Attempt each part of each problem yourself. Read each portion of the
      problem before asking for help. If you don't understand what is being
      asked, ask for help interpreting the problem and then make an honest
      attempt to solve it.
    * Write up each problem independently. On both Part A and B exercises you
      are expected to write the answer in your own words.
    * Write on your problem set whom you consulted and the sources you used. If
      you fail to do so, you may be charged with plagiarism and subject to
      serious penalties.
    * It is illegal to consult materials from previous semesters.
***** Exams *****
There are four in-class 50-minute exams, and one final exam.
If a student misses or fails an exam, he or she may take a make-up exam at
certain arranged times. Make-ups for failed exams can boost the student's grade
only up to the lowest passing score.
***** Grading *****
Grading is based an a 900 point scale, where the homework is worth 250 points,
the four exams are worth a total of 400 points, and the Final Exam is worth 250
points.
