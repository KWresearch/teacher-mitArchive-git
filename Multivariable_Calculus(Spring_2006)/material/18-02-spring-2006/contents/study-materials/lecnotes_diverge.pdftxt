18.02 Notes on Divergence and Partial Diﬀerential Equations 

This section describes the role played by the divergence theorem in  the study of heat ﬂow 
and motion  in  liquids  and  gases.1 

We  will  illustrate  using  the  example  of  smoke  in  the  air.  The  same  principles  apply  to 
a  dye  in  water  or  a  drug  in  the  bloodstream.  We  distinguish  two  factors  contributing  to 
the  motion  of  the  smoke.  The  ﬁrst  is  called  diﬀusion,  the  spreading  of  the  smoke,  and  the 
second  is  called  convection,  the  transport  of  the  smoke  by  the  wind. 

The  smoke  is  modeled  by  a  function  u(t, x, y , z )  that  represents  the  density  or  concen­
tration  of  smoke.  For  example,  if  we  assume  that  all  the  smoke  particles  are  of  equal  size, 
then  we  can  deﬁne  u  as  the  number  of  smoke  particles  per  cubic  centimeter.  The  quantity 
u depends  the variables representing  time  t  and  space  (x, y , z ).  Suppose  that  the movement 
of  particles  of  smoke  is  represented  by  a  ﬂow  rate  F.  The  starting  place  is  the  equation

u dV  = − 
for  any  surface  S  enclosing  a  region  D.  This  equation  says  that  the  net  rate  of  change  of 
the  amount  of  u  in  D  equals  minus  the  amount  of  u  that  ﬂows  out  through  S  (ﬂux  of  F 
through  S ).  The minus  sign  comes  from  the  convention  that  dS = ndS  is  chosen  so  that  n 
points  outward,  so  that  the  ﬂux  is  positive  when  smoke  is  ﬂowing  out  through  S .

Formula  (1)  is  the  integral  form  of  an  equation  that  has  an  equivalent  diﬀerential,  or 
inﬁnitesimal,  form  given  by

The  diﬀerential  form  is  easier  to  deal  with  than  the  integral  form  for  both  practical  and 
theoretical  reasons.

The divergence theorem  is used  to show that  (1) and  (2) are equivalent,  as follows.  First, 
to  see  that  (2)  implies  (1),  integrate  (2)  over  the  region  D,  then  apply  the  divergence 
theorem,

Rewrite  the  left-hand  side  of  (1)  by  exchanging  the  order  of  diﬀerentiation  and  integration.

(Diﬀerentiation  under  the  integral  sign  was  explained  in  an  earlier  note.  It  is  analogous  to 
diﬀerentiating  a  sum  term  by  term.)  Combining  (3)  with  (4)  yields  (1).

In  other  words,  the  partial  diﬀerential  equation  (2)  is  valid. 

Example  1.  The  diﬀusion  equation.  In  the  case  of  diﬀusion  alone,  that  is,  when 
there  is  no motion  of  the  air,  the  smoke  spreads  slowly  and  lazily  according  to  the  formula 

F = −k�u 

To  explain  this  physical  law,  consider  a  screen  or  membrane  and  the  net  ﬂow  of  particles 
across the  screen.  The ﬂow  is  from higher  concentration to  lower concentration, so  it points 
in  the  direction  of  −�u.  The  ﬂow  rate,  the  magnitude  |F|,  is  faster  when  the  diﬀerence 
in  concentrations  is  greater.  The  simplest  such  relationship  is  ordinary  proportionality: 
|F| = k |�u|.  Together these formulas for the direction and magnitude of F give F = −k�u. 

Combined  F = −k�u  with  (2)  one  ﬁnds

= −div  F = −div  (−k�u) = k�2 u 

In  other  words,

This  is  known  as  the  diﬀusion  equation.  It  is  also  known  as  the  heat  equation  because  it  is 
also satisﬁed when u  is  interpreted as a  temperature rather than as a concentration of a dye 
or  of  smoke.

Example  2.  Convection  or  Advection.  Not  only  does  smoke  diﬀuse  in  the  air  it  is 
also  carried  by  the  wind.  The  motion  of  a  velocity  v  is modeled  by 

(8) 

F = uv 

This  expresses  the  idea  that  the  entire  quantity  of  u  at  a  given  position  is  moved  by  the 
velocity  vector  v.  The  convection  equation  is  then

Next,  let  us  us  show  how  this  convection  or  transport  equation  reinforces  our  physical 
intuition  for  what  the  notion  of  divergence  means.  Consider  the  case  of  constant  density 
u  =  c  at  time  t  =  0.  When  we  say  that  a  ﬂuid,  such  a  water,  is  incompressible,  we  mean 
that  the volume of ﬂuid does not change with  time.  Put  another way,  if  the density u starts 
out  constant  then  it  should  remain  constant  for  all  time.  For  u =  c,  � u/� t =  0.  It  follows 
from  (9)  that 

(10) 

div  v = 0 

A  ﬂow  v  satisfying  (10)  is  known  as  incompressible.  Although  the  word  refers  only  to  com­
pression not expansion,  its physical meaning is  that  the ﬂuid neither expands nor contracts. 

For  an  incompressible  ﬂow  v,  equation  (9)  simpliﬁes,  because  by  the  product  rule 

div  (uv) = �u · v + u div  v = v · �u 

The  transport (or convection) equation for incompressible ﬂow takes the more familiar form

Example  3.  Convection-diﬀusion.  Combining  the  eﬀects  of  diﬀusion  with  convec­
tion  yields  the  equation  governing  the  motion  of  smoke  (and  also  of  heat  in  a  traditional 
convection  oven).  To  do  this,  just  add  together  diﬀusion  and  convection: 

F = −k�u + uv  �� 

� u 
� t 

= −div  F = k�2 u − div  (uv)  �� 

� u 
� t 

+ div  (uv) = k�2 u 

The  convection-diﬀusion  equation  (also  called  advection-diﬀusion)  governs  the  concentra­
tion  of  smoke  u  blowing  in  the  wind  with  given  velocity  v.  A  traditional  oven  is  called 
a  convection  oven  because  the  heat  is  transported  near  the  food  by  the  circulation  of  the 
air.  (When  the  oven operates on  the  broiler setting,  however, radiant heat  does most  of  the 
cooking.) 

Example  4.  Navier-Stokes  Equation. 

To  determine  the  velocity  ﬁeld  v  of  the  air,  a  further  system  of  equations  is  required. 
These equations are known as the Navier-Stokes equations.  In  the  incompressible case,  they 
are 
 


�
+ v · �  v = ��2 v − �p
Here �  is a physical constant known as the viscosity.  It plays the  same mathematical role as 
the diﬀusion contant k for smoke.  The letter p denotes a scalar function intepreted physically 
as  pressure.  The  Navier-Stokes  equation  says  that  v  itself  satisﬁes  a  convection-diﬀusion 
equation  with  an  extra  pressure  term.
