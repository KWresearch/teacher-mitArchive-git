18.02  EXAM  3  SUMMARY  Spring  2006 

A.  Topics  on  Exam  3  will  be 
1.  Evaluate  an  iterated  integral;  sketch  the  region  of  integration;  exchange  order  of 
integration. 
2.  Find a moment of inertia or a (weighted) average value.  Average value includes center 
of  mass  as  a  special  case. 
3.  curl 0 test for conservative ﬁelds; ﬁnding potential functions; applying the fundamental 
theorem  of  calculus  for  line  integrals. 
4.  parametrize  curves  so  as  to  compute  line  integrals  directly;  compute  them  indirectly 
using Green’s  theorem. 
5.  change  of  variables  in  double  integrals;  use  this  to  calculate  integrals. 
B.  Topics  that  will  not  be  on  this  exam,  but  you  will  see  later  are:  probability;  triple 
integrals;  spherical  and  cylindrical  coordinates 
C. The  table of  integrals from Notes 3B will be printed on  the  front of  the  exam.  We are 
not  aiming  to  give  you  complicated  integrals  to  evaluate.  On  this  exam  and  the  ones  that 
follow,  you  should  look  out  for  the  possibility  that  symmetry  may  show  that  an  integral  is 
zero.  Also,  you  should  feel  free  to  quote  a  known  fact  such  as  the  total  area  of  a  disk  of 
radius  a  is  �a2 ,  without  carrying  out  an  integral. 
When you substitute, say u = sin �, remember to do so on an interval on which the change 
of  variables  does  not  double  back  on  itself.  0 � � � �  does  not  work,  but  −�/2 �  � � �/2 
does.
