18.02 Supplementary Notes on Lagrange Multipliers


RING  ON  A  STRING.1  Consider a ring on  a string held ﬁxed at  two ends  at  (0, 0) and 
(a, b).  The  ring  is  free  to  slide  to  any  point.  Find  the  position  (x, y)  of  the  ring. 

Physical  principle.  The  ring  settles  at  the  lowest  height  (lowest  potential  energy): 

minimize  f (x, y) = y 

Constraint.  Length  L  of  the  string  is  ﬁxed:

�
g(x, y) =  x2  + y2  + (x − a)2  + (y − b)2  = L 
The  curve of  all possible positions was drawn on blackboard using  string:  This  is  an  ellipse, 
but  knowing  that  does  not  help.

This equation expresses tangency of the constraint curve g = L with the level curve (straight 
horizontal line)  y = c.  (The  second equation 1 = �gy  contains no extra  information because 
one  can  just  choose  �  = 1/gy .)  The  equation  gx  =  0  can  be  interpreted  as  the  equality  of 
the  cosines  of  two  angles.

Physical  and  geometric  conclusions:  The  angles  �  and  �  are  equal.  Using  vectors  to 
compute  the  force  exerted by  gravity on  the  two halves  of  the  string,  one  ﬁnds  that  there  is 
equal  tension  in  the  two  halves  of  the  string  –  a  physical  equilibrium.  (From  another  point 
of  view,  the  equal  angle  property  expresses  a  geometric  property  of  ellipses:  Suppose  that 
the  ellipse  is  a  mirror.  A  ray  of  light  from  the  focus  (0, 0)  reﬂects  oﬀ  the  mirror  according 
to  the  rule  angle  of  incidence  equals  angle  of  reﬂection,  and  therefore  the  ray  goes  directly 
to  the  other  focus  at  (a, b).) 

Formulas  for  x  and  y .  We  did  not  yet  solve  the  problem  all  the  way  for  the  location 
of  (x, y).  We  will  now  show  that

Adding  these  two  equations,

�
�
x2  + y2  + (x − a)2  + (y − b)2  cos � = L cos �  =�  cos � = a/L 
The  corresponding  calculation  with  y  is  (noting  that  y < 0) 
 
 
�
�
−y =  x2  + y2  sin �; 
b − y = (x − a)2  + (y − b)2  sin � 
Adding  these  two  equations,

Use  the  relation  cos �  =  a/L  to  express  L sin �  =  L  1 − a2/L2  =  �L2  − a2  as  a  function 
�
of  L  and  a.  Then  the  formula  for  y  is 
 
 
 
�
�
�
b −  L2  − a2 
Finally,  to ﬁnd  the (simplest way to express) the formula for x use the similar right triangles

Thus  we  have  formulas  for  x  and  y  in  terms  of  a,  b  and  L.  While  it  is  nice  to  derive 
the  complete  solution,  we  got  all  of  our  physical  intuition  and  understanding  out  of  the 
problem  from  the  balance  condition  that  was  the  immediate  consequence  of  the  critical 
point  computation,  which  we  carried  out  using  the  Lagrange  multiplier  method.  This  is 
why  I  omitted  the  derivation  of  the  formulas  for  x  and  y  in  lecture.

Final  Remark.  Any  two-variable  constrained  max/min  problem,  such  as  this  ring 
problem  can  also  be  solved  by  one-variable  calculus  methods  using  the  idea  of  implicit 
diﬀerentiation.  Namely,  consider the  constraint g(x, y) = L  as  the  implicit deﬁnition  of y  as 
a  function  of  x.  Diﬀerentiate  with  respect  to  x: 

dy 
gx  + gy  = 0 
dx 

dy
We  are  minimizing  y ,  so  the  condition 
=  0  substituted  into  the  equation  above  yields 
dx 
gx  = 0.  This  is  the  same  as  the  Lagrange multiplier  equation  used  above.
