18.02  MINIMAL  LIST  OF  TOPICS  AND  TECHNIQUES


UNIT  1 

cross  product,  dot  product,  lines,  planes,  angles,  parallel,  perpendicular 

solve  a  3  by  3  system  using  an  inverse  matrix;  know  when  this  procedure  works 

velocity,  acceleration,  speed,  arclength 

UNIT  2 

linear  approximation,  tangent  plane,  chain  rule,  directional  derivative 

contour  plots,  especially  direction  of  the  gradient 

max/min;  evaluate  function  at  critical  points,  boundary  points  (including  inﬁnity) 

diﬀerentiate  with  constraints;  Lagrange  multipliers 

UNIT  3 

evaluate  multiple  integrals;  exchange  order  of  integration 

evaluate  line  integrals  directly 

Green’s  theorem  in  work  form  and  in  ﬂux  form  (2-D  ﬂux  deﬁnitely  will  be  tested) 

change  of  variable  (Jacobian  factor) 

UNIT  4 

volume/mass  or  average  value 

ﬁnd  potential  functions  and  use  them  to  evaluate  line  integrals  (fundamental  theorem) 

3-D  ﬂux  and  divergence  theorem
