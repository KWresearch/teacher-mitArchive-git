1.  Triple  integrals;  surface  integrals  (dV  and  dS ) 

Exercise.  In  each  of  rectangular,  cylindrical  and  spherical  coordinates,  ﬁnd  the  coordinate  de­
scription  of  the  following  surfaces.  Also  ﬁnd  dS  and  dS  for  these  surfaces.  (This  extra  exercise  is 
provided  not  because  this  topic  is  emphasized  over  the  others,  but  rather  because we  studied  these 
coordinate  systems  a while  ago.  Recall  that  equations  for  surfaces  are  used  as  limits  of  integration 
in  triple  integrals  as  well  as  in  setting  up  surface  integrals.) 

a)  the  sphere  around  the  origin  (�  =  a);  b)  planes  x  =  a,  y  =  a,  z  =  a;  c)  the  cylinder  r  =  a;  d) 
the  cone  π = π0 ;  e)  the  sphere with  origin  at  the  South  Pole  (� = 2a cos π). 

Example.  x  =  a  ≤�  r cos �  =  a  ≤�  r  =  a/ cos � .  If  0  �  a  <  b,  then  the  description  of  the 
“vertical  slab”  a < x < b  in  cylindrical  coodinates  is 

a/ cos � < r < b/ cos � ;  −�/2 < � < �/2;  −� < z < � 

(The  limits  on  �  come  from  cos � > 0.) 

Evaluation  of  integrals.  You  will  be  provided  with  the  usual  table  of  powers  of  sine  and  co­
sine.  Know  how  to  integrate  using  substitution,  such  as  the  substitution  u  =  sin �  to  integrate 
sinn � cos � d� . 
Types  of  integrals.  You  are  expected  to  know  the  formula  for mass  and moments  of  inertia,  and 
average  value.  Questions  on  Exam  4  in  probability,  if  any,  are  limited  to  the  all-important  average 
value  and  probability  as  a  ratio  of  masses,  areas,  or  volumes,  as  in 

Probability = 

mass(part)
mass(whole) 

2.  Line  integrals  in  3-D,  gradient  ﬁelds,  curl,  ﬁnding  potential  functions. 

Test whether F  is a gradient ﬁeld by computing curl  F .  Use a systematic method (your choice) 
to  ﬁnd  a  potential  function.  Use  that  potential  function  to  compute  line  integrals  (Fundamental 
theorem  of  calculus  for  line  integrals). 

3.  Stokes’  theorem.  If  the  curve C  is  the boundary of  the  surface S  and  they are  compatibly 
oriented  then

4.  Divergence  theorem.  If  the  surface  S  encloses  the  solid  region  D ,  then
