***** Welcome to 20.109! *****
For many of you this will be the first time in a research lab and for others it
will not, but it is our goal to make this class a useful and fun introduction
to experiments and techniques in biological engineering. There is not time
enough to show you everything you'll need to know if you go on to do research,
but after taking this class you should feel confident and familiar with some
fundamental experimental approaches and lab protocols. You will develop good
habits at the bench, ones that will increase the likelihood of success in your
work and ensure the health and safety of you and those around you. By the end
of the semester, you should also be aware of good scientific practice, having
had some experience with report writing, notebook keeping and publicly
presenting your data. All of us involved in teaching 20.109 hope you will find
it a satisfying challenge and an exciting experience that has lasting value.
***** Prerequisites *****
    * Biology GIR (One of 7.012, 7.013, or 7.014)
    * Chemistry GIR (One of 3.091, 5.111, or 5.112);
    * 6.00_Introduction_to_Computer_Science_and_Programming
    * 18.03_Differential_Equations
    * 20.110J_Thermodynamics_of_Biomolecular_Systems or 20.111J Physical
      Chemistry of Biomolecular Systems
***** How 20.109 Varies from Term to Term *****
20.109 is offered twice per year in the fall and spring semesters, with
rotating instructor responsibilities. Reflecting the instructors' specific
expertise and the evolving biological engineering field, the topics covered
will change over time. The fall_term_classes, led by Natalie Kuldell, emphasize
her molecular genetics, microbiology, and synthetic biology expertise. The
spring term reflects Agi Stachowiak's biomaterial and tissue engineering
background.
***** Coursework Requirements *****
You will perform three series of experiments (called "modules") over the course
of the semester. The modules differ in both intellectual and experimental
content, and in the ways that your learning will be assessed.
You will be working as pairs throughout the semester in lab, but you must
submit individual written work (for both daily homeworks and major assignments)
and give individual journal club presentations. You will close out the course
by developing and presenting a novel research idea as a two-person team. Please
read the 20.109 statement_on_collaboration_and_integrity for more detail about
academic honesty in our class.
We appreciate that time management can be a difficult skill to develop, and
that learning takes place on many time-scales. However, when assignments are
turned in at wildly disparate times, it creates additional logistical burdens
for the teaching faculty. Therefore, late work (both daily and culminating
assignments) will be penalized 1/3 of a letter grade for each day late and will
not be accepted after a week. We strongly recommend that you plan ahead and
space out your work when possible.
**** Assignments and Grading ****
See the Assignments page for more details on these items.
                     Course assignments and grading.
MAJORÂ ASSIGNMENTS
MODULE TOPICS              ASSIGNMENTS                %Â OFÂ FINALÂ GRADE

In addition to the module major assignments listed above, there are several
other forms of required coursework.
    * Daily Lab Quizzes (5% of final grade)
    * Homework Assignments (8% of final grade)
    * Laboratory Notebooks (5% of final grade)
    * Participation (2% of final grade)
**** OpenWetWare Wiki ****
Since 20.109 is a lab class, we think the students, TAs and instructors would
benefit from having a shared space in which to discuss experimental protocols
and results. By putting all the course materials on an OpenWetWare wiki, they
can be updated and improved instantly by everyone (not just the instructors).
