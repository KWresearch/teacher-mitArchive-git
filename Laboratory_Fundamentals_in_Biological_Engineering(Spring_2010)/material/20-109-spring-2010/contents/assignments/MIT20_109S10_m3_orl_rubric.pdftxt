Elements of a strong presentation 
relates proposal to topics covered in 20.109 when
• 
appropriate 
sufficiently explains concepts/ methods/etc. not 
covered in 20.109
the what, why, and how (are you going to do it) of 
the idea are each clear and compelling 
the project scope is reasonable 
• 
•  exhibits novelty/creativity
•  clear and concise description of the central question
to be investigated, and its significance
sufficient for intelligent non-experts to understand
• 
the proposal 
•  describes/credits relevant prior art
•  well-defined hypothesis and goals
staged roadmap for investigation 
• 
the experiments address the central question and
• 
include good controls 
•  methods needed to understand the predicted
outcomes are explained, without unecessary detail
show sample data if experiment works (summarize in
tabular form, make mock graphs, show published
images from similar work, etc.) 
•  describe alternate assays, questions, and/or 
information still gained if experiment does not work
•  consider specialized resources needed (e.g., plasmids,
cell lines, access to large/costly equipment) 
•  detail is good, but not needed for every resource, nor 
is detailed budget info. required
reiterate question, detail its importance to science and
• 
society
•  answers that convey understanding 
•  admit when you lack knowledge, tell how you would 
approach the question based on what you know
•  content introduced in logical, easy-to-follow 
sequence 
•  main points emphasized, repeated 
transition statements between ideas 
• 
slide titles convey key message 
• 
•  good balance of text and figures 
text/figures large enough to be seen 
• 
•  considered use of color 
•  not too many or too few slides

Talking points 

•	

all elements of a good individual presentation
(effective use of voice, body, and language), plus: 
collaborative effort: partners speak for equal times,
don’t interrupt each other, take turns being “on stage” 
overall appears rehearsed, with smooth transitions
between speakers, talk is cohesive 
review/preview structure of talk 
•	
12’ length (+/- 0.5 min)
•	
•	 main points to be made during talk (can be
incomplete sentences) 
•	 well thought-out transitions 
best work will include supporting detail, in case
•	
needed for Q&A
