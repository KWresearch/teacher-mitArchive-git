***** Overview *****
You will perform three series of experiments (called "modules") over the course
of the semester. The modules differ in both intellectual and experimental
content, and in the ways that your learning will be assessed. Links to the
experiments and assignments are provided below.
You will be working as pairs throughout the semester in lab, but you must
submit individual written work (for both daily homeworks and major assignments)
and give individual journal club presentations. You will close out the course
by developing and presenting a novel research idea as a two-person team. Please
read the 20.109 statement_on_collaboration_and_integrityÂ for more detail about
academic honesty in our class.
We appreciate that time management can be a difficult skill to develop, and
that learning takes place on many time-scales. However, when assignments are
turned in at wildly disparate times, it creates additional logistical burdens
for the teaching faculty. Therefore, late work (both daily and culminating
assignments) will be penalized 1/3 of a letter grade for each day late and will
not be accepted after a week. We strongly recommend that you plan ahead and
space out your work when possible.

***** Daily Work *****
In addition to the module assignments listed above, there are several other
forms of required coursework.
    * Daily Lab Quizzes (5% of final grade)
          o These are intended to refresh your memory about the experiment you
            are performing. They will not be hard and should take no more than
            5-10 minutes at the beginning of lab.
    * Homework Assignments (8% of final grade)
          o These will vary considerably in content and points associated with
            each assignment. You may be asked to perform a calculation, draw a
            conclusion, and/or make a figure using the data you have collected.
            The homeworks can be found in the "for next time" section of each
            lab day. You can work with your lab partner, friends and teaching
            assistants on these assignments but you will hand in individual
            assignments unless otherwise specified.
    * Laboratory Notebooks (5% of final grade)
          o You will record your data on the white pages of a bound notebook.
            The yellow, duplicate pages will be collected and evaluated by the
            teaching assistants. Notebooks will be evaluated according to these
            guidelines.
    * Participation (2% of final grade)
          o As a student in 20.109, you are expected to be an active
            participant in a scientific community. Your student colleagues, the
            teaching faculty, and especially your lab partner, are all your
            collaborators. They rely on you for timely posting of your data,
            and for your unique and thoughtful contributions during class. Your
            participation grade will ultimately be reviewed by all the teaching
            faculty, but as a starting point, you should fill out the self-
            assessment rubric once per module. (PDF)
