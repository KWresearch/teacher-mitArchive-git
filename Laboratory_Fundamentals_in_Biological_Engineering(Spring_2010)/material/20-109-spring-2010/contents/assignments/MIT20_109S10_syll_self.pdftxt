Rubric for Participation, Self-Assessment 

Read the rubric below at the beginning of each module, and keep it in mind throughout (e.g., you 
might carry a copy in your lab notebook). For each module, evaluate your experience both 
numerically and – briefly – in writing. (A few sentences will suffice.) Be sure to explain any 
extra credit awarded. The evaluation will be due on the first day of the next module.

The statement that best describes my lab/class
sessions for Module ____ is… 
•  My partner and I discussed why we were doing
what we did, worked effectively together, and
asked questions when we wanted to learn more. 
I mostly (7) or sometimes (8) just went through the
motions in lab. However, I basically know what’s
going on, and have made minimal errors. 
I didn’t understand the protocols but didn’t ask for
help, or was excessively sloppy, and made a big,
avoidable error or created a safety hazard. 
I was attentive and contributed at least once every
2-3 lectures (answering and/or asking a question). 
I mostly paid attention, but rarely (8) or never (7)
actively participated in lecture. 
I missed more than one lecture. 
I was attentive and made regular contributions
during (all or nearly all) pre-lab lectures. 
I mostly paid attention, but rarely (8) or never (7)
actively participated in lecture. 
I was late and disrupted lecture more than once. 
• 
•  My group posted our clearly labeled data to the
Talk pages in a timely fashion. 
•  During journal article discussions in class, I was
prepared and substantially participated. 
•  After journal club or oral proposal talks, I asked 
questions of my peers. 
I investigated and shared some interesting research
related to a topic we discussed. 
I asked a sophisticated question that spurred an
interesting follow-up, which was later shared with
the class.
