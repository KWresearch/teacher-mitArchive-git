“Blob-level” protein design

• Basic idea is to combine protein units of deﬁned function (domains) to
engineer a fusion protein with novel functionality
• Examples include sensors, signal transduction components,
transcription factors, therapeutics, etc.

Can you think of other sensors one could construct
based on this design strategy?

What knowledge is required for “blob-level” protein engineering?:
 • rough geometry of protein domains (low resolution structure)
 • secondary structure, if insertions or disruptions are planned
 • desired linker properties (length, ﬂexibility, hydrophilicity)

What weve called “blob-level” design is useful for combining
functionalities associated with individual protein domains–but what if
we want to create new functionalities or make subtle manipulations?

Protein engineering at high resolution

10

• Alter/tune properties of proteins by making structurally or
computationally informed changes at the amino acid level
• In some cases, produce entirely new proteins based on predictions of
structure and function from amino acid sequence
• Can be “rational” when combined with structural information and/or
computational modeling approaches
• Can be “irrational” when combined with high throughput screening and
random mutagenesis (to be discussed later in the module)

This is what we are doing in the lab for this module!
1.  We looked at the CaM & GFP structures and made predictions about
which point mutations would shift the calcium afﬁnity of pericam.
2.  We are now going to produce the mutant genes and proteins, and 
assay puriﬁed molecules for desired properties.
3.   If we had more time, we might then go on and make a new round of
predictions/mutant proteins, to continue the process of tuning the
calcium afﬁnity.

improvement of function/utility

The “holy grail” of rational engineering is to design entire proteins de
novo to fold into a deﬁned shape (and ideally carry out a function)

13

Simplest task is to design peptides with deﬁned 2° structure

What knowledge is required for “high-resolution” protein engineering?:
 • determination of 3D structure, for mutagenesis-based engineering
 • knowledge of protein folding rules for de novo engineering
 • computational modeling techniques usually required

16

Computational methods important for protein engineering:
 • modeling & visualization
 • energy/thermodynamic calculations
 • searching conformation and sequence spaces
 • comparison with known protein structures/sequences

The basis of more automated analysis of structural perturbations than
our own “inspect and try” approach involves use of an energy function
to evaluate plausibility of candidate structures:

Etot = Ebond + Eangl + Edihe + Eimpr + EVDW + Eelec + EHbond + ...

This may be evaluated using a force ﬁeld (e.g. CHARMM19) and
atomic coordinates available from simulation or modiﬁed PDB ﬁle.

Computational techniques for investigation of speciﬁc structures:
 • molecular dynamics:  simulate physically plausible movements of a 
 protein, with a “rule” that describes probability of motions in 
 conjunction with the energy function at a given temperature
 • energy minimization:  gradually perturb a model protein structure to
 ﬁnd a locally favorable structure (energy minimum) in the neigh-
 borhood of a starting structure
 • both techniques can be applied after in silico mutagenesis, e.g. to 
          anticipate the effect of mutation on stability or ligand binding
