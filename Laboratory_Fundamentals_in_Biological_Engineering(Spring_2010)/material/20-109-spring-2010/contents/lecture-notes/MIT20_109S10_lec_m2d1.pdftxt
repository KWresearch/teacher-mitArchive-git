Calcium indicators can be used to detect signaling in individual cells and
multicellular ensembles. Two purposes:
 • learn what stimuli trigger calcium ﬂuctuations and how calcium 
 behaves in context of an organism or system
 • use calcium as a “handle” on cell-cell interaction (e.g. neural activity) 

Calcium is important to cellular signaling
in the immune system.  Activation of B-
cells can be detected by calcium imaging
in lymph nodes (Qi et al., 2006, Science).

Pericam is a second generation calcium sensor, based on design 
strategies originally developed by Roger Tsien and colleagues. Tsien
won a 2008 Nobel Prize for engineering novel forms of GFP.

Calmodulin (CaM) facts and ﬁgures

9

• 16-18 kD (depending on species), ~20 x 40 Å protein
• highly conserved among eukaryotes (vertebrate and yeast calmodulin
are functionally interchangeable)
• binds four Ca2+ ions using EF hand amino acid sequence motifs
• Ca2+-CaM binds short segments of target proteins, modulates activity

N- and C-terminal 
domains of CaM 
both contain two EF 
hand motifs

Ca2+-saturated CaM binds to peptides by “grasping” target sequences, 
in helical conformation, between N- and C-terminal domains.  In many
cases, this activates an enzyme by sequestering an inhibitory domain
(e.g. M13 from MLCK).  Interactions between CaM and targets involve
hydrophobic contact area and charge-charge interactions.

Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)

from the jellyfish Aequoria victoria is a protein fluorophore and compo-
nent of genetically-encoded calcium indicators.  The molecular structure 
(1996) shows a chromophore formed by spontaneous cyclization and
oxidation of three amino acids (Ser/Thr65, Tyr66, and Gly67).

Mutations can also affect calcium sensitivity; both Kd (afﬁnity) and
cooperativity (slope/shape of transition) can be affected.  Miyawaki et
