Methods for generating mutant protein libraries:
     • site-directed mutagenesis with degenerate primers
     • error-prone PCR
     • gene shufﬂing

• not all combinations of AAs possible at each position
• number of combinations expands exponentially
• degenerate primers synthesized by split-pool method
• standard primer design criteria must be considered

PCR polymerase and conditions may be chosen to promote mutations

normal PCR

error-prone PCR

error rate = mutation load ÷ template doublings

some mutations are
more likely than others

Gene shufﬂing techniques mimic diversity due to meiotic recombination:
 • fragments of homologous genes combined using “sexual PCR”
 • diversity may arise from error prone PCR or multiple genes

How are libraries of mutant proteins screened?

8

All major methods include a strategy to keep DNA sequence info 
associated with the proteins that are being screened.

Phage display is a versatile high throughput method to do this:

protein “displayed” on the coat
of a bacteriophage, by fusing to
a natural phage coat protein

M13 phage 
(contains DNA)

Yeast display:  similar to phage
display, but with proteins fused to
a Saccharomyces cell wall protein
(DNA in yeast)

What would you expect advantages to
be, compared with phage display?

In this example, a po-
pulation of scFvs was
screened for binding to an
antigen

Ribosome display:  mRNA and synthesized proteins held together non-
covalently on a ribosome

11 

What are advantages of this
technique over phage/yeast
display methods?
 • screening not in the 
 presence of large particles
 • incorporation of unnatural 
 amino acids

What about properties other than afﬁnity?

12

A simple example:  screen for dsRed variants with different excitation and 
 emission wavelengths–how could this be done?
