Observations can inspire new research!

•" Experimental design 

Boston!

Denver!

•" Analysis 

Geographical temperature-tracking 
experiment: quantication!

•" Which data suggest a real difference? How can we know?

•" Ultimately, data means little without a mechanism and 
novel predictive ability 

Conception and pregnancy: what does all
 
this have to do with 20.109?!

•" Posing a good question: 
–" Seek out prior knowledge 
–" Consider interest and impact 

–" Develop good controls 

•"

Interpretation of data: 

–" Understand each collection step  

–" Perform quantitative analysis 
–" Be aware of biases and assumptions 

–" Peer review

Scientic writing must tell a story!

•" Archimedes, Newton, Kekulé 
–" Stories help us remember 

•" You discover the narrative that the data tell 
•" Then convince an audience of your findings 
–" Step-by-step explanations 

–" Repetition of central ideas 
–" Clear visuals  

Your data should be true even if your story is wrong 

~ Darcy Kelley, Columbia (from The Canon, N. Angier)!
