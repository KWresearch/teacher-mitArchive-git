Suppose alleles A and B each occur in 50% of the population and 
segregated independently, what are the chances that a randomly 
chosen individual displays the AB phenotype?

How many biallelic polymorphisms would have to be considered
for each genotype to have a 1:1,000,000 chance of occurring,
assuming equal prevalence of each?

How does sequencing work?
Perform PCR on template to be sequences; each PCR reaction is 
terminated by a nucleotide analog that can be incorporated, but not 
added to.  Terminated PCR products must be labeled in some way.
