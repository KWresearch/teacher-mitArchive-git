How can proteins be produced?

7

1.  Purify from natural source
advantages:  no chemistry or DNA manipulation required, proteins 
likely to fold properly, assemble with native cofactors, etc.
disadvantages: usually only practical for high abundance proteins,
source-speciﬁc puriﬁcation method required

2.  Synthesize de novo 
advantages: no DNA manipulation required, synthesis methods 
well established, proteins produced are relatively pure
disadvantages:  relatively expensive, becomes extremely difﬁcult
for polypeptides > 50 amino acids

3.  Express and purify from a dedicated expression system
advantages: cheap and frequently high-yield, versatile expression
systems already established
disadvantages: cloning required, troubleshooting often needed to
obtain high expression and proper folding

Solid phase peptide synthesis is a reliable technique for generating
short polypeptides
