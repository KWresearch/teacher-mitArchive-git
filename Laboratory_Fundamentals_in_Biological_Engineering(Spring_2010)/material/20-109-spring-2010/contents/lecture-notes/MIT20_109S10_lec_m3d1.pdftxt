Biomaterial Engineering!

Module 3, Lecture 1!

20.109 Spring 2010!

 1!
Topics for Lecture

g"

•! Introduction to tissue engineerin
–! motivation"
–! basic principles + examples"
•! Introduction to Module 3"
–! background: cells and materials"
–! experiment: purpose and structure"

Ability to repair tissue is limited!

•! Severe trauma (acute or disease-state)
 
challenges tissue repair capacity"
•! Donor tissue"
–! scarcity, immune response (graft or host)"
•! Autologous tissue"
–! availability, donor site morbidity"
•! Permanent synthetic substitute"
–! inammation, mis-match, failure "
 
•! A new approach: promote regeneration
of ~native tissue"

Scaffolds provide a framework!
•! Why a porous, degradable scaffold?"
–! mechanical support"
–! allow ingrowth, avoid inammation "
–! promote nutrient+oxygen diffusion"

•! How is the scaffold made degradable?"
–! cross-links susceptible to cleavage"
–! e.g., West JL & Hubbell JA, Macromolecules  32:341 (1999)"

collagenase exposure!

collagen peptide"

5!

Cytokines promote cell functions!
•! Types of cytokines"
–! growth factors (FGF, TGF, BMP)"
–! angiogenic (VEGF)"
–! chemokines (attract cells)"
•! Delivery of cytokines"
–! release from scaffold or transplanted cells"
•! Example: CCL21 promotes T cell migration "
     Stachowiak et al., J Immunol 177:2340 (2006)."

Cells make up tissues!

•! Progenitors vs. differentiated cells"
–! scarcity, function"
•! Transplanted vs. in situ cells"
–! scarcity, safety"

•! Example: tumor-inltrating 
lymphocytes (TIL)"
–! T cells lose function in tumors"
–! expand TIL ex vivo, treat with 
cytokines, and transplant"
–! tested in mice!

tumor regression!
