Scientific writers need to control the 
rhetoric of scientific writing.

According to Aristotle, rhetoric is "the art of 
finding in any given case the available means 
of persuasion."

The goal of scientific writing is to court 
your audience. 

Michael Halloran on Watson & Crick’s 
1953 “The Structure for DNA” 
“The April 1953 paper, then, 
is really just the initial move 
in a rhetorical strategy aimed 
at gaining and holding the 
attention of an audience. As 
such, it presumes an 
understanding of science as a 
human community in which 
neither facts nor ideas speak 
for themselves, and the 
attention of the audience 
must be courted.” 	Photo removed due to copyright restrictions.

1.0 Introduction 

By obtaining a more profound understanding of all aspects of DNA repair pathways, it may be easier for 
future breakthroughs in creating chemotherapeutic strategies that specifically and effectively attack 
cancers, and thus radically change modern cancer treatment. In order to contribute to this understanding 
of homologous recombination, we have created an assay that will enable us to determine when 
homologous recombination has taken place. 

What features of this paragraph identify it as belong to the  

Introduction?   


The introduction provides a framework for the story you are about to 

tell, and thus serves two main purposes. For one, you must provide 

sufficient background information for a reader to understand the 

forthcoming results. Just as importantly, you must motivate the 

audience to keep reading! How? Reveal the significance of the work 

through connections to both prior scientific accomplishments and 

future applications.

2.0 Methods 

In order to perform bacterial transformation, 5 µl of each purification ligation reaction was added to 50 µl 
of competent bacterial cells, also a positive control was prepared with an uncut pCX-EGFP plasmid. These 
solutions were then heat shocked in a 42ºC bath for 90 seconds so that the competent cells could uptake 
the DNA. 0.5 ml of LB media was then added to each reaction, and 200 µl of each tube was plated onto 
separate LB + AMP plates using a sterile spreader. Each plate was then incubated at 37ºC overnight. 

What features of this paragraph identify it as belong to the  

Materials & Methods?    


The methods section should allow an independent investigator to 
repeat any of your experiments. Use sub-section headings to allow 
readers to quickly identify experiments of interest to them (e.g., 
"Protein conjugation to hydrogels" and "Cell culture and fluorescent 
labeling"). When commercially available kits were used, it is sufficient 
to cite the name of the kit and say that it was used according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol. The key to a good methods section is 
developing your judgment for what information is essential and what 
is extraneous. Note that the methods section should be written in the 
past tense, since your experiments are completed at the time you 
are writing your paper. This section should also be written in 
complete sentences and paragraphs, not in bullet point form. 
From http://openwetware.org/wiki/20.109%28S10%29:Guidelines_for_writing_up_your_research 

Your research article should contain a 
Methods Section, not a Protocol. 

A Protocol is . . . 
 A series of steps to 
be carried out. 
 Written in sequential 
or temporal order. 
 Intended for the 
reader to achieve a 
final result. 

A Methods Section is 
 A series of steps 
already completed 
and is written in past 
tense. 
 Written in logical 
order. 
 Intended for the 
reader to replicate 
the experiment.

3.0 Results 

As expected the digestion of plasmid backbone (Lane 2) displayed a band of about 4.8 kbp in length, as 
digesting with SalI would linearize the DNA. However, two other bands were seen in addition to the 
expected band, which could be due to poor enzyme efficiency. Lanes 3-5 in Figure 6 also confirm the 
projected length fragments of 3.7 kbp and 1.6 kbp (from Figure 5). This result indicates that the candidate 
clones were indeed the desired construct. 

What features of this paragraph identify it as belong to the  

Results?

The purpose of the results section is to present your data in a relatively unbiased way, but with some 

guiding framework. Begin with a short description of the goal and strategy of your overall experiment, 

and then delve into specific sub-sections that describe each piece of the work.  

To write the results section, use the figures and tables as a guide. . . . . Present the data as fully as 

possible, including stuff that does not quite make sense at first glance. Ultimately, each sub-section 

should begin with an overview sentence that introduces the present experiment and end with a 

sentence stating the primary conclusion reached from that experiment. (Sub-section headings and 

figure caption titles can also emphasize said conclusion.) The overview and/or concluding sentences 

should also provide a transition to the previous/next piece of data when possible. . . . 

Note that verbs in the results section are usually in the past tense. Only established scientific knowledge

is written about in the present tense, “the world is round,” for example. You cannot presume that your 

own data are part of the body of established scientific knowledge, and so when you describe your own 

results, use the past tense, “a band of 1.3 kb was seen,” for example. There are, however, exceptions to

this general rule. It is acceptable to say, “Table 3 shows the sizes of the DNA fragments in our 

preparation.” It is also acceptable to say, “In a 1991 paper, Ebright and coworkers used PCR to 

mutagenize DNA.”

What Differentiates Results from 
the Methods? 

Methods = How 
the data were 
accumulated.	
 

Results = What 
data were 
accumulated.	
 

Readers expect to find the “answers” to your 
research questions in your Results section.

What Differentiates Results from 
Discussion? 

Results = Data Presentation 
(“Experiments showed that . . . .”)	
 

Discussion = Data Interpretation 
(“Experiments suggest that . . . .”)	
 

However, you still need to choose which data 
to present in your Results Section (an act of 
interpretation!).	
 

4.0 Figure Caption 

Results of gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel. Lane 1-4 contain the pCX-NNX backbone. In Lane 
1 the vector is uncut. In Lane 2 the plasmid is cut with XbaI (? 4.8 kbp), while in Lane 3 it is cut with 
EcoRI (? 4.8 kbp). Lane 4 shows the backbone double digest with XbaI and EcoRI (?4.7kbp). Lane 5 is the 
10Kb DNA Ladder. Lanes 6-7 contain the ?5-EGFP (PCR Product) insert. Lane 6 is the double digest (?0.66 
kp), and Lane 7 shows the uncut insert. Lane 8 is the negative PCR-no template control. (Yellow Group W/ 
F) 
What features of this paragraph identify it as belong to a 
Figure caption?   

Legends to the figures and tables explain the elements that appear in 
the illustration. Conclusions about the data are NOT included in the 
legends. As you write your first draft, you might state in a short 
simple sentence what the point of the figure or table is. In later 
drafts, make sure each element of the figure or table is explained. 
Your figure legends should be written in the present tense since you 
are explaining elements that still exist at the time that you are 
writing the paper.

5.0 Discussion 

With regards to the results obtained from flow cytometry, several unexpected results were observed. To 
begin with, all the negative controls had some cells that fell to the right of the diagonal line (greater 
FL1:FL2 ratio), suggesting that they expressed EGFP. This is likely due to the MES cells having background 
fluorescence or that there was contamination in the samples. However the most surprising result was the 
almost complete lack of homologous recombination in the ?3+?5SgrAI samples. This was surprising as we 
hypothesized that an increase in distance of a double strand break would decrease HR; however, we still 
believed that it would be greater than having no double strand breaks. 

What features of this paragraph identify it as belong to the  

Discussion?   


The purpose of the discussion section is to interpret and contextualize your 

data. You should begin by reiterating the purpose of your research and your 

major findings. Then you might do any or all of the following: connect your 

findings to other research (published or that of your peers); describe any  

ambiguities and sources of error in the data, and suggest future experiments 

to resolve uncertainties; explain where you expect your work may lead, and 

suggest specific experiments for extending your findings; describe any  

conceptual or technical limitations of the research. Finally, you should explain  

the significance of your findings to basic science and to engineering 

applications. Like the previous sections, the discussion should have a clear 

organization and narrative flow, whether or not you use sub-sections.
