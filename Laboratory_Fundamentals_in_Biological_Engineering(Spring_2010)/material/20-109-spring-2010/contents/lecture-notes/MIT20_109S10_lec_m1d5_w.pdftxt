Presentation Basics 

According to The Book of Lists, 
public speaking is the Number One human fear. 

Outline 

• Before you begin … 
• Structuring the presentation 
• Principles of effective visual support 
• Delivering the presentation 

Before you begin… 

Oral vs. written communication 
• Challenge for the presenter: 
•  Must communicate in “real time” 
• Challenge for the audience: 
•  Can’t control rate of presentation to match their 
comprehension 
•  Can’t re-read sections 

Ask yourself... 
• What is the main point I want to make to my
audience? 
• Why is this interesting or important? 
• How do the data support my main point? 
• What part of my story can I tell with the data in
the allotted amount of time? 

Know your material and its 
message 
Content is the key! 
• Collect more information than you will use 
• Anticipate problem areas 
• Research unfamiliar words, methods, etc. 
•  If possible, get a broader context 
•  Read a review of paper 
•  Read later paper by the same group 

Know your audience 
• Who are they? 
• What do they know? 
• What might some of them not know? 
• What do they want to know more about? 

A journal club has a distinct 
audience and purpose 
Purpose 
Audience 
•  Get acquainted with 
•  Fellow researchers 
research project 
(peers) 
•  Understand research in 
•  Similar (not identical) 
technical backgrounds 
context 
•  Consider limitations of 
•  Not experts on this 
particular research 
research 
project 
•  Learn how it might apply 
to future projects, work 
in 20.109 

Structuring the Presentation 

Tell a story 
• Narrative Structure 
•  Beginning: 
introduction 
•  Middle: 
data 
•  End: 
summary 
• Show how each section relates to and builds 
upon the one before it 
• Engage the audience’s interest as they follow 
the narrative 

Structuring the Presentation 

Preview and Review 
•  Map out goals of the talk in advance 
•  Use topic sentences in body of the talk 
•  Summarize 
•  at end of your talk 
•  at end of each section

Time 

Guide your audience through the 
logic of the scientific process 
Arrange ideas in a logical 
sequence 
•  Most important point first 
•  Emphasize key points as you 
make them 
•  Provide explicit transitions 
between points

Introduction 
•  Introduce yourself 
•  Give the title (+ author, journal) of your 
article 
•  In one sentence, introduce the central 
question or problem of the experiment 
•  State significance of experiment; why 
should we care? 
•  Briefly explain necessary background 
•  Give audience a preview of approach to 
problem 

Data 
•  Forms bulk of presentation 
•  Drawn from Methods, Results and 
Discussion of paper 
•  keep explanation of methods to a 
minimum -- only as much as needed to 
understand results 
•  integrate discussion as you go 
•  Data are only worth presenting insofar as 
they relate to your central question 

Summary 
•  What do you want your audience to remember 
about your talk? 
•  Remind your audience of primary findings 
•  Explain what these findings contribute to the field 
•  Emphasize the potential interest/utility of 
findings to your specific audience 

Q & A 
•  Anticipate questions not covered in the
presentation 
•  OK to bring extra slides 
•  OK to acknowledge gaps in expertise 
•  Explain what you do know 

Principles of Visual Support 

Or: Why use slides at all? 
Advantages: 
Disadvantages: 
• can convey a point quickly 
• disruptive -- pull 
audience’s attention 
• add variety and interest 
away from the speaker 
• audience recall increases 
and onto the screen 
dramatically when the 
speaker uses effective slides 

Ask yourself: What specific message are you trying to 
convey with your visual? 

Direct the audience’s focus

•  Hea
dings should clarify the main 
nt of each slide

Use clear, explanatory 
labels for charts and 
diagrams 
•  Make sure to label axes!

Less is More 
Limit number of slides 
Say more than you show 
•  show primary points on slide; flesh out secondary points verbally 
Minimize text 
•  Don’t crowd your slides with a lot of text.  Especially, avoid using 
complete sentences -- or worse, complete paragraphs.  Either the 
audience will become engrossed in trying to read the text, and will 
stop paying attention to you, or else they’ll wonder why you didn’t 
just give them a handout already and save yourself the trouble of 
reading to them. 
Avoid potentially annoying animation 
• Really. 

More Design Principles 

Color 
• Be easy on the eyes; don’t distract from content 
• Avoid low-contrast combinations

• Sans serif headings
• Serif bullets

ease of reading)

Using graphics in a presentation 

What story does this 
picture tell? 
“As shown in Fig. 2, the 
loss of neuraminidase 
activity from the super-
natant coincides with 
the disappearance of 
this 66-kDa protein. 
This indicates that 
neuraminidase activity is 
precipitated via the 66-
kDa protein.”

Delivering the Presentation 

Rehearse! 
•  Practice at least 3 times 
•  Practice with a colleague for feedback 
•  Is your content clear? 
•  Do you rock, squirm, gesture too much? 
•  Is there room for improvements/adjustments? 
•  Time yourself 
•  What 3 questions will your audience likely ask? 

On Presentation Day... 

•  Arrive early 
•  Check equipment and voice projection 
•  Bring a backup of your presentation 

How to Connect with the Audience 

Put yourself in the audience’s place 
•  Explain novel ideas/terms or references 
•  Use everyday language and terms 
•  Clarify connections that may be obvious to you but not them 
Engage the audience 
•  Establish eye contact; look at people 
•  Convey enthusiasm; if you aren’t excited about your subject, 
your audience won’t be either 
A presentation is two-way communication 
•  Pay attention to audience reaction; modify your talk as needed 

Standing 

•  Don’t block the screen! 
•  Stand at a 45-degree 
angle to the audience 
•  Keep weight evenly 
dispersed on both feet

Gesture and Movement 

•  Make non-verbal behavior deliberate; avoid extraneous 
motion 
•  Some walking adds variety; too much is distracting 
•  Use gestures that complement your speech’s content and are 
natural for you 
•  Know what your body language says

Vocal Issues 

Volume 
•  Project to back of room: 
support voice from diaphragm 
Rate 
•  Speak at appropriate rate for 
audience comprehension

•  Slow down for especially complex or important content 
•  Incorporate strategic pauses at key points 
Pitch 
•  Keep pitch of your voice at a natural level 
•  Avoid “uptalk” 

Handling Anxiety 

•  Practice and prepare 
•  Focus and center yourself 
•  Breathe 
•  Have a conversation

•  Get acquainted with the research 
•  Design your slides 
•  Practice your talk 
•  Deliver your talk
