Standards in Scientic 
Communities II; Cell Viability!

Module 3, Lecture 4!

20.109 Spring 2010!

Lecture 3 review!

•! What can you learn from a 
condence interval? A t-test?"

•! What three general engineering 
principles might help make biology 
more “engineerable”?"

Systems
'Can I have three inverters?'

Devices

'I need a few DNA binding proteins.'

'Get me this DNA.'

Parts

How valued are TE standards?!

•! 2007 strategic plan for TE clinical success by 2021#

!! 24 int"l leaders in TE 
listed high-priority areas#
!! 1/3 named standards#
•! Analysis#
!! concept dominance#
!! progress so far#
! standards 7th of 14#
!

Eng 13:2827 (2007)#

4. Cell sourcing/characterization.#

How useful are TE standards?!

•! See 2005 editorial by A. Russell "
–! proposes need for standards "
–! in data collection and sharing"
•! Choose and respond to a student excerpt (~10#)"
•! Pros/cons/etc… ? "

Can we standardize this TE construct?!

Module progress: week 2!

•! Day 3: viability/cytotoxicity testin
g"
•! Groups generally found "
–! mostly live"
–! mostly round"
–! some clustering"
•! How do we explain the results?"
•! How can we improve the assay?
"
•! What conditions killed cells?"

•! How can we make thick tissues?"
!! in vitro: dynamic/perfusion culture"
!! in vivo: promote rapid angiogenesis!

Modeling cell viability in TE constructs!

A! Cells in odd layers

!

•! Porous PLGA scaffolds"
•! Seeded cells as in (A) or (B)"
•! Observed after 10 days"
•! Model includes"
–! Diffusion"
–! O2 use"
–! Cell growth"
•! Model assumes"
–! [O2]bulk is constant"
–! Quasi-steady state "

Lecture 4: conclusions!

•! Strategies besides standardization may 
take precedence in some BE elds."

•! Cell viability in TE constructs is affected 
by cell, material, and soluble factors."

•! Modeling can elucidate nutrient diffusion 
and cell viability proles."

Next time: transcript and protein assays; 
advice for module 2 report revision."
