Q:  Our design task is to alter calcium sensitivity of pericam
derivatives. We chose mutants to make, but how will we determine 
the results of our perturbations?

3

A:  We will measure titration curves, by adding ﬁxed amounts of
calcium to samples of mutant pericam and measuring an indicator of
binding (in this case ﬂuorescence).  From these data, we will extract 
estimates of binding parameters.

What is going on during a titration measurement? 

4

We want to measure Kd from ﬂuorescence.  Pu and Pb are ﬂuorescent 
to different degrees, so that the total ﬂuorescence is equal to the sum 
of contributions from the two species:

F = Fu

[P

F/Fmax is equal to the fractional saturation of pericam calcium binding
sites, often abbreviated .  can be expressed as a function of
calcium concentration as follows:

[Ca2 + ]4
(EC50 )4
+ [Ca2 + ]4

EC50 = (Kd)1/4 is the calcium concentration at which half-maximal 
binding and ﬂuorescence change occurs.

Calcium sensing could realistically be performed for calcium
concentrations near the EC50, and our design goal is equivalent to
shifting the EC50 of the pericam derivatives.

If we had ﬂuorescence data over a range of calcium concentrations, 
and assuming these equations accurately describe calcium binding to 
pericam, we could determine the EC50 and Kd using a variety of 
methods:

6

1.  Look for midpoint of the ﬂuorescence change

(simulated data)

7

2. Hill analysis
 • substitute  = F/Fmax
 • set y = log[/(1 - )]
 • plot y vs. x = log([Ca2+]) for  
 transition region 
 • slope tells number of cooperative  
 binding sites, “Hill coefﬁcient” 
 • x intercept is log(EC50)

=

3. Curve ﬁtting
 • consider the equation we derived:
[Ca2 + ]4
F
Fmax
+ [Ca2 + ]4
(EC50 )4
• express as y = x4/(c4 + x4)
 • use Matlab or related to determine
 value of c that best ﬁts the data
 • could leave the exponent as a free
 parameter n, equal to Hill coeff.

Hill coefﬁcient reﬂects cooperativity, a phenomenon of binding to 
multiple binding sites on an individual target: positive cooperativity
means that binding to one site promotes binding to other sites; 
negative cooperativity means that binding to one site depresses 
binding to other sites.

8

For comparison with pericam, consider (noncooperative) calcium 
binding to BAPTA, a commonly used calcium-speciﬁc chelator:

In this case, the equation that describes a titration curve (fraction of 
bound sites vs. calcium concentration) is:

Simulated binding curves for BAPTA and pericam compare as follows:

pericam: sharper transition
BAPTA: broader transition

pericam: sigmoidal transition
BAPTA: smooth transition

pericam: greater slope (Hill
coefﬁcient)
lesser slope
BAPTA:

The titration behavior weve been discussing for pericam is idealized, 
because we have been assuming complete cooperativity among the
calcium binding sites (all four Ca2+ ions bind at once).  In fact, binding
to individual sites can occur independently, but each sites apparent
afﬁnity depends on whether the other sites are occupied.

10

No titration curve provides enough detail (features) to accurately ﬁt all
the independent equilibrium constants in the “full picture.”  One
possibility is to settle for a compromise that ﬁts data from CaM-based 
sensors:

11

F
Fmax

= f1 

[Ca2 + ]n1
K d1 + [Ca2 + ]n1

+ f2 

[Ca2 + ]n2
K d2 + [Ca2 + ]n 2

n1 and n2 are the Hill coefﬁcients associated with the transitions from 
Pu to P  and from Pi to Pb, respectively. f1 and f2 are the fractional
i
ﬂuorescence changes associated with these two steps.

Why is modeling pericam with two calcium-dependent transitions 
particularly appropriate?

• your mutations in pericam may affect the apparent Kds (or EC50s)and
Hill coefﬁcients for two transition steps
• the “resolution” of the two steps may be affected–note that the parent 
pericam appears to have a single transition, in part due to the
E104Q mutation (cf. curve with black circles above)
• in some cases, your mutations may affect the relative ﬂuorescence 
changes of the two transition steps

Note on calcium concentrations

13

How is a range of known calcium concentrations be produced?
 • note that EC50s are typically around 1 μM; the most useful calcium
 concentrations will be near the EC50
 • you may need > 1 μM protein to make robust measurements
 • need to make sure that we know the concentration of unbound 
calcium, as opposed to total calcium concentration

Fmax

= f1 

[Ca2 + ]n1
K d1 + [Ca2 + ]n1

+ f2 

[Ca2 + ]n2
K d2 + [Ca2 + ]n 2

We will solve this problem by using a calcium buffer
 • analogous to a pH buffer, with pCa2+ determined by afﬁnity of the 
          buffer (in our case EGTA) and absolute amount of Ca2+ present

[Ca2 + ] =

[Ca2 + - EGTA ]
[EGTA ]  K a

• with 10 mM Ca2+-EGTA/EGTA mixtures, the amount of pericam 
          present is unlikely to have much effect


Binding may be quantiﬁed using methods other than ﬂuorescence

14

Other techniques for titration curve measurement:  

• absorbance spectroscopy 
e.g. O2 binding to Hb ,

• circular dichroism, e.g. Ca2+
binding to TrC fragments
