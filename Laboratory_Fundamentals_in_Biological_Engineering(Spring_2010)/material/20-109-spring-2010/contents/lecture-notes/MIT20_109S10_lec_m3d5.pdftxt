Topics for Lecture 5!

•! Measuring protein levels"
•! Measuring transcript  levels"

•! Module 2 report revision "

Module overview: 2nd half!

1.! Enzymatic digestion"

est for collagen 
T
roteins (by ELISA)!
p

rate dissolution!
2. EDTA-cit

Purify mRNA from cells!

Amplify collagen cDNAs!

Compare collagen I and II transcript  levels, 
normalized to GAPDH!

3!

Antibodies are specic and diverse!

•! Specicity"
–! variable region binding, KD ~ nM"
–! linear or conformational antigens"
•! Diversity"
–! gene recombination"
•! Production"
–! inject animal with antigen, collect blood"
–! hybridomas (B cell + immortal cell)"

Day 5-7: protein analysis by ELISA!

•! ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay"
–! specic"
–! sensitive"
–! multiple ki
nds"

       of interest"

Common protein-level assays!

•! PAGE "
–! simple and low cost"
–! Coomassie detection limit ~ 0.3-1 ug/band 
(2-5 ng/band for silver staining)"
–! cannot distinguish two proteins of same M
• Western blot
!
"
–! identies specic protein"
–! detection limit ~1 pg (chemiluminesce
nt)"
–! only simple for denatured proteins"
•! ELISA"
–! detects native state proteins"
–! quantitative"
–! high throughput"

Common transcript-level assays!

•! RT-PCR (end-point)"
–! simple, low cost"
–! can be semi-quantitative"
•! Microarrays (end-point)"
–! high cost, need specialty equipment "
–! complicated and fraught analysis"
–! high throughput "
•! q-PCR (real-time)"
–! some special equipment, medium cost"
–! highly quantitative"
–! multiplexing potential"
–! require optimization (primers)"

"

•! Real-time tracking of DNA production"
•! Uses probes that uoresce"
–! when bind to any DNA"
–! when bind to specic DNA (FRET)"
•! Why does PCR plateau?"
•!
Several analysis methods"
–! threshold cycle CT"
–! relative standard curve: fold-change 
of a transcript (normalized)"
–! efciency-correction: compare genes"
–! absolute levels by radiolabeling"

Module 2 revision: small but 
important points!
•! Words have precise meanings"
–! e.g., “signicantly”"

•! Numbers imply a claim"
–! excess digits often reported"

•!

In results, be descriptive, not jargony or methods-oriente
d "
–! e.g., “lysis solution” vs. “BPER”"
–! e.g. “aligned sequence with WT” vs. “used BLAST”"

–! e.g., explain “diagnostic digest gel”"

•! Avoid wiki language: "
–! 1) it#s plagiarism, and 2) it has a different purpose/audience than 
your report (most egregious e.g., “protein behavior assay”) "

•!

Italicize enzyme names (e.g., AccI)"

10!

Module 2 revisions: writing and
 
analytical examples !

•! Data analysis"
–! Subtleties in SDS-PAGE data"

•! Read excerpts demonstrating"
–! Appropriate abstract content"

–! Sufcient narrative in a results section"

–! Concise but thorough analysis"

–! Effective opening for discussion section"

Lecture 5: conclusions!

•! Antibodies to diverse targets (e.g., proteins) can 
be made and used for detection/measurement."

•! Trade-offs exist (e.g., between simplicity and 
accuracy)  for different transcript-level assays."

Next time: cartilage TE, from in vitro and 
in vivo models to the clinic; imaging."
