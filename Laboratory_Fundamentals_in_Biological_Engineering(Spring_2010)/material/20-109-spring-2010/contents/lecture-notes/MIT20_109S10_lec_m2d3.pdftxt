Introduction to ﬂuorescence     

6

Fluorescence arises from transitions among molecular energy levels:     

Jablonski diagram

• electronic energy levels correspond to visible wavelengths, 
• vibrational energy levels correspond to infrared wavelengths, with
• rotational energy levels are coupled to vibrations and account for
 the smooth appearance of absorption/emission spectra

• small organics like ﬂuorescein are the most common ﬂuorophores
• in general, the larger the aromatic ring system, the longer the 
 wavelength for excitation and emission 
• quantum dots are ~10 nm particles that exhibit narrower emission 
 bands and less “bleaching” than organic dyes 
• some atoms (lanthanides) exhibit ﬂuorescence as well

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) can take place when 
the absorption spectrum of an “acceptor” overlaps with the emission
spectrum of a “donor,” and geometry favors dipolar coupling between
the ﬂuorophores.

donors are deexcited by the FRET
mechanism is deﬁned as the Förster

Fluorescent calcium sensors

A wide variety of ﬂuorescent calcium dyes are available. They differ
along several axes:
• calcium afﬁnity
• absorbance and emission properties 
• structural properties (e.g. protein vs. small molecule, membrane 
permeability, binding and localization) 

Indicators with each set of properties may be suitable for speciﬁc
experiments.

A typical calcium sensor consists of a calcium sensitive component 
attached to one or more ﬂuorescent moieties:

18

Suppose you measure ﬂuorescence intensity from a cell, but you dont
know either how much dye is present or what the calcium concentration 
is; you have one equation in two unknowns ([L]tot and [Ca2+]):

measurements at another wavelength, to get a second equation:

Genetically-encoded calcium sensors:
 • FRET-based CaM-XFP fusions (CaMeleons)
 • CaM + single XFPs (pericams, camgaroos, GCaMPs)
 • troponin C based

Advantages of genetically-encoded calcium indicators:
 • noninvasive delivery (expression within cells)
 • constant resynthesis (limited effect of bleaching)
• targeted expression

Protein sensors genes can be introduced by making transgenics, or
by in vivo transfection (viral, electroporation, “biolistics,” etc.).
