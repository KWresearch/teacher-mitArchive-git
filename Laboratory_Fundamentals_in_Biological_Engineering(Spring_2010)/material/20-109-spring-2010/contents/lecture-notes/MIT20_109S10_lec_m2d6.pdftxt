Tags may be chosen because they
 • interfere minimally with protein structure/function
 • improve recombinant protein expression or solubility

     • offer most convenient puriﬁcation methods

All tags may be cleaved from expressed proteins using speciﬁc
proteases, if desired.

use Beer-Lambert law: 
A280 = ε280cl 
ε280 is the extinction 
coefﬁcient; it can be 
determined rigorously, 
or estimated: 
ε280  ~  nW  x 5500
 + nY  x 1490
 + nC  x 125

Assessing proteins for identity and purity 
Most standard technique is sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE):
 • basis is the tendency of proteins to unfold in SDS and bind a  

 ﬁxed amount SDS per protein (1.4 g/g)

 • negative charge of SDS overwhelms protein charges
 • proteins have same charge to mass ratio, but are differentially  

 retarded by the separation gel

 • stacking layer “focuses” proteins before separation layer 
glycine ions

Coomassie brilliant blue staining 

13 

• binds proteins primarily via aromatic
residues and arginine 
• undergoes absorbance shift from 465
nm (brownish) to 595 nm (blue) 
• basis for Bradford Assay; can be used
to quantify proteins over ~3 kD

SDS-PAGE gives an approximate MW and purity estimate, but how can
we be sure the protein weʼve puriﬁed is the correct one?
 • activity assay if one is available
 • knowledge of exact mass (mass spectrometry)
 • N-term. sequencing and AA analysis, if necessary

N-terminal sequencing (Edman degradation)

15

• products identiﬁed by chroma-
 tography or electrophoresis
• typically ~5 cycles practical for
 routine N-term. sequencing
