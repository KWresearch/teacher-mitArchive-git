Day 5-6: image analysis!

•!

Imaging data is often high throug
hput"
–! 4D: time, x-y-z "
–! requires computation, and!
–! human design/interpretation"
•! Many available analysis package
s"
–! some ~ $20-30K"
–! NIH ImageJ = free"
•! Your analyses"

Scaffold-free in vitro cartilage TE!
Static!

•" Method: rotational culture of rabbit 
chondrocytes with no cytokines!
•" Results!
–" Mostly dynamic culture gave best resul
ts: 
low apoptosis, very rigid disc!
–" Fresh ECM made: primarily CN II and 
PG !
–" Organized architecture, similar to in viv

•" A scaffold-free method is inherently
 
biocompatible!

Advantages of working in vivo!

•! Ability to mimic human disease-state"

•! Ability to mimic therapy/surgery applied to humans"
–! especially true for large animal models"

•! Can compare results to “gold standard” treatment"

•! The construct interfaces with an actual wound, the 
immune system, etc. - more realistic environment"

•! Toxicity studies more meaningful"

15!

Cartilage pathology!

•! Cartilage has little regeneration capacity – why? "
• Early damage can promote later disease
"
!
•! Osteoarthritis pathology"
–! PG and collagen loss, PG size !"
–! " water content, ! strength"
–! chondrocyte death"
•! Symptoms"
–! loss of mobility"
–! pain"

Lecture 6: conclusions!

•! Both in vitro and in vivo models of cartilage repair
 can 
reveal valuable insights, but have different strengt

•! Cell-based therapies have come to market for car
tilage 
TE, and scaffold-based therapies are on the horiz
en."
