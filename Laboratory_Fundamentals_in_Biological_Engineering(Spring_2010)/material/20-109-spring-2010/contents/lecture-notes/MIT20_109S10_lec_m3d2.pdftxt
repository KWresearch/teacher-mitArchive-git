Interlude: what (if any) should 
be off-limits to science?!
1.! “Hallucinogens have doctors tuning in again” 
NY Times April 2010"

"Researchers from around the world are gathering this week in San Jose, Calif., 
for the largest conference on psychedelic science held in the United States in 
four decades. They plan to discuss studies of psilocybin and other psychedelics 
for treating depression in cancer patients, obsessive-compulsive disorder, end-
of-life anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and addiction to drugs or alcohol.!"

drugs by the healthy” Nature 456, 702-705!
