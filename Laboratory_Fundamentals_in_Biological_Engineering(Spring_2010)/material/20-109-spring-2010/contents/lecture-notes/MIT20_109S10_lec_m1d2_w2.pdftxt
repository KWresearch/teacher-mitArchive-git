Meeting Scientific Language Goals 

Accuracy and accessibility 

3 

Accuracy

  Deliver objective data and ideas accurately 
- Concise description of context, including theory

- Forecast of expected results

- Clear sketch of methodology and experimental setup

- Explanation of results

- Discussion of findings


  Discuss your analysis of the results accurately

- Explain what you think about your findings

- Convey sense of discovery to the reader


4 4

Accessibility 
  Analyze potential readers for your report 
- Assume broader readership than fellow 20.109 students 
- Make reports accessible to the broad scientific community 
- Remember that readers may include generalists or professionals from 
other fields with partial knowledge of the field and your work 

  Respect expertise of multidisciplinary readers 
- Understand what the various categories of readers bring with them when 
they read your report 
- Recognize that making a report broadly accessible is NOT “dumbing it 
down”

Eliminating Jargon 

“The greatest possible merit of style is, of course, to make the words absolutely disappear into the thought” 

Nathaniel Hawthorne qtd. in Alley, 128

Beware of word choice

  Use concise, concrete words readers understand 
- Test wording

- Keep it simple (KIS)

- Use Webster’s Dictionary to check nouns converted to verbs

- If you are unsure whether your readers will understand an expression,

define it in the text, a footnote or a glossary 

  Define acronyms on first mention 
- Spell out the entire expression, capitalizing proper nouns and adjectives 
- Put the acronym in parenthesis after the full expression 
- After defining an acronym, use it

Addressing Mechanical Matters 

English grammar is dynamic because the language is alive

Verbs and technical reports

Present 
Past 

Future 

  Present tenses 
- Simple present: action takes place now or is habitual: i.e., the theory behind 
scientific work 
- Present progressive: action ongoing right now 
- Past present: action that started in the past and is repeated in the present or that 
just ended 
- Past present progressive: action has been ongoing since a past time 

11 11

Verbs and technical reports 
  Past tenses 
- Simple past: a discrete action that started and ended in the past: commonly used 
for your experimental methodology and setup as well as your results 
- Past progressive: action has been ongoing since a past time 
- Past perfect: If two discreet past actions were sequential, the first belongs in the 
past perfect 
- Past perfect progressive: action took place continuously before another past 
action 
  Future tenses 
−  Simple future: action that is predicted: less common in technical writing

Thoughts on proofreading

  Really hard because it is tedious, 
perhaps even boring 
  Use, but do not overuse, the software 
- Works best for binary issues 
- Find mistakes and then search for 
them 
- Be very judicious in taking software 
grammar advice 

  Do not leave proofreading for late at 
night 

  Always proofread from a print out

Being Brief 

”...brevity is the soul of wit ...” 
Polonius to King Claudius and Queen Gertrude, Shakepeare’s Hamlet, II.ii.90

Readability and brevity go hand-in-hand


	 The Flesch Readability Scale 
(FRS) quantifies what makes a text 
easier to read 
	 FRS = 
- 206.835 - (1.015 X ASL) - (84.6 X ASW) 
- Where 
- ASL is average sentence 
length in words 
- ASW is average syllables per 
word

	 Abstract:  In order to further understand the mechanism by which the 
ki
gi
nas n region of EnvZ 
protein functions, and more broadly the family o
inases that share such conserved 
istidin
hf 
 ke
regions, the optimization of a Bacterial Photography System was pursued through the selection 
of mutants of a fusion Cph1-EncZ protein that exhibited increased Kinasing activity. 
Characterization of the amino acid changes causing the K+ phenotype revealed steric and 
electrostatic influences of mutations in key residues that could be responsible for the ultimate 
increase i
g
bn
eta alactosidas activity, or more broadly, the system’s output signal.

−	 Notes:  Webster views kinase as a noun without verb or adjective forms, “an enzyme 
capable of activating a zymogen or one causing the transfer of the terminal phosphate 
group, generally from ATP (defined by Webster as a nucleotide, C10H16P3O13N5, present in 
and vital to the energy processes of all living cells) to a receiving molecule.” 
−	 Webster views histidine as a noun without verb or adjective forms, “a nonessential amino 
acid, C3H3N2CH2CH(NH)2COOH, that is essential for growth in infancy.” 
−	 betagalactosidase: Not explicitly defined in Webster
