SDS‐PAGE preparation 
Acrylamide ‐ toxic 
•  You will make whole cell extracts with equal cell #s

–  Based on OD600  reading, normalize 
(1) OD = 1.0  (2) OD = 0.5 
Vmax = 15mL

(1)7.5mL + 7.5mL H20

(2)15mL

•  Gel separates proteins based on size, 
•  Sample preparation 
–  SDS:  coat proteins with negative charge 
–  β‐Me:  breaks S‐S bonds 
–  Boiling:  denature higher‐order structures 
–  Sample Buffer has SDS, β‐Me, plus 

glycerol, BPB dye

SDS‐PAGE visualization, analysis 
•  Visualization: Coomassie stain (binds certain AA) 
•  Two ladders: visualization, quantification 

in real‐time, 
pre‐stained

Today in Lab

•  Lyse cell pellets in BPER 
–  BSA “carrier,” protease inhibitors 
–  Add 4 mL lysis enzymes 
•  Run a 25 µL aliquot through SDS‐PAGE

–  Two ladders also Æ boil these too 
–  Stick with equal volumes if you have < 25 
•  Purify IPC protein from the rest (long!)

–  Immediately take 10 µL aliquot and 
measure concentration 
–  The rest is stabilized w/BSA, to be titrated 
against calcium next time
