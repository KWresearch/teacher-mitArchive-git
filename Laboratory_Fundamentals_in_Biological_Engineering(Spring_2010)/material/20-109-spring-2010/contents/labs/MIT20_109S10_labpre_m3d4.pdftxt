Day 4: RT-PCR recap 


•	 RT = reverse transcriptase 
–	 what does this enzyme do? 
•	 Unique primer design needs 
–	 how to isolate transcript... 
–	 … but not genomic DNA? 
•	 RT and PCR can be done in one 
reaction or two 
–	 enzyme de/activation by temperature 
–	 hot start enzymes in general 
•	 What kinds of controls are desired?

internal control with a co-amplified
housekeeping gene Æ control for starting amount(s)

Module overview: 2nd  half


1.  Enzymatic digestion


Test for collagen 
proteins (by ELISA) 

RNAse‐free 
technique! 

2. EDTA-citrate dissolution 
(1)  lyse (RLT+B‐Me) 
(2) homogenize (reduce viscosity) 
in hood 
Amplify collagen cDNAs 
Purify mRNA from cells 

Next time run a gel to compare collagen I and II 
transcript  levels, normalized to GAPDH
