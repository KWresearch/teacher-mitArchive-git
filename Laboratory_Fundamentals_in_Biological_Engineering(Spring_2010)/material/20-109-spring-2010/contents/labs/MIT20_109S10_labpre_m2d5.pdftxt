lac operon 
These three genes encode metabolic enzymes


lacI 

control

lacZ 

lacY 

lacA 

promoter + operator 

Encodes a  repressor protein 
that binds to control area 
turning it OFF. 

In turn, if lactose binds to the 
repressor, it is made inactive, 
turning ON expression of Z, Y, A. 

Induction of a chosen protein


lacI 

control

T7RNAP 
(polymerase) 

lacZ

T7RNAP gene is expressed in presence of lactose or analogue. 
[IPTG]0  = [IPTG]t 

bla promoter is constitutively on. 

T7 promoter is turned on in presence of 
T7RNAP. 

BL21(DE3) bacterial strain


n

g

p l a

o m e 
DE3: bacteriophage (virus) used to integrate 
lac/T7RNAP into E. coli


s m i d 
pLysS: protein that produces lysozyme, which 
binds to T7RNAP, reducing “leaky” expression. 
Retained by chloramphenicol selection. 

Sequencing reactions

different fluorophore 
Dideoxy method: no 3’ OH Æ can’t elongate 
ddA′, A′′, C′′′, T′′′′ 
Run 4 rxns: (d)dT, dA, dG, dC and 3 others 

* = radioactive or fluorescent label


Today in Lab: Samples


•	 Start with four DE3 samples carrying plasmid

–	 WT 
–	 M124S 
–	 X#Z candidates 1 and 2 
•	 After gel and sequencing analysis, pick just 
one X#Z to continue working with 
•	 End of day, “hand in” 6 pellets, or (3 pellets, 3 
cultures, and 3 eppendorfs) to teaching 
faculty
