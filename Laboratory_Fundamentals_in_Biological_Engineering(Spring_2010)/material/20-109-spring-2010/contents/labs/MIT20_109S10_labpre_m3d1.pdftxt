Tissue Culture (TC) Environment 

•  What will “feel” physiological to a cell? 

T = 37°C

pH ~ 7.2 – 7.4 

[salts] (don’t shrink)

*cell density

surface/3D

ambient O2 
humidity 

CO2  (5%)


* sterility

Tissue Culture (TC) Medium 

•  What do cells need to survive? 
Food and/or cell life: 
energy: glucose and/or L‐glutamine 
(optional: Na Pyr) 

essential amino acids 
optional: non‐ess. aa 
vitamins, minerals, lipids 

co‐factors, reaction 
building blocks 

serum: cytokines 
Non-food:	 antibiotics  pen/strep

(optional: antimycotic, AmphB)

‐phenol red (track pH)


Components of a TE construct


scaffold/matrix 	
Õ  usually degradable, porous	

soluble factors 
Õ  made by cells or synthetic 
Õ  various release profiles 

cells 
Õ  precursors and/or 

differentiated

Õ  usually autologous


integrated implantable or 
injectable device

Today in Lab: Research + Design 
•  Practice cell culture with mouse cell line 
•  Skim >=3 out of 8 articles 
– Read abstract 
– Skim methods:  find typical alginate %, cell density,   etc. 
– Skim results/discussion: summarize in 1‐2 sentences 
– Goal: finding  what you need (not deep/close reading)
•  Make your own plan 
– Vary one parameter: simple or sophisticated 
– Check cell availability with teaching faculty 
– Request unique materials/equipment needed 
– Goal:  choose an experiment goal, conceive design
