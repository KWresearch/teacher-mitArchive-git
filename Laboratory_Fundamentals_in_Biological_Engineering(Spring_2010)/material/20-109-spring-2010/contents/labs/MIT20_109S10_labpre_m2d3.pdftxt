•  Lab notebooks: need reasoning and 

interpretation, not just protocol

•  Questions about Quiz 1?

plasmid 

Ca2+ 

primers for SDM (5’ ‐>)

reverse complements 


Polymerase error rates


•  Taq polymerase  ~ 1 in 105 
errors in #bp 
– Standard version has no proofreading capability 
(exconuclease) 

•  Pfu polymerase ~ 1 in 106 
– Standard version requires longer extension times 

DNA EP: Shape‐dependence


Plasmid versus linear samples 

say, 4 Kbp plasmid 
linear DNA runs with ladder 

restriction site Æ 2‐cut: sums to 4 

uncut plasmid: supercoiled – fast  
circular – slow 

+ high MW dimers, etc. 

Remember to wear nitrile gloves.


Bacterial transformation


(keep cold, don’t vortex) 

1) chemical 
treatment 

competent cells 

other methods (1‐step) 
•electroporation 
•ballistics

2) heat 
shock 

DNA Amplification in Bacteria


Why grow/test multiple candidates? 
some plasmids may be incorrect 

cells that pick up plasmid Æ multicellular colonies 

Troubleshooting SDM


•  After 2 years of working, suddenly no colonies

in teaching sample! What could be wrong?

•  Master Mix problem or changed composition 
•  primers – 125ng 
•  thermal cycler conditions, issue 
•	 template – 5 ‐ 50ng Æ problem with [template] 
or inhibitory component 

SDM: control and class data


kit control 
digested 

undigested 

primers! 

SDM: titration data


1:300 IPC 
gave 
50 – 100  colonies 

1:100 IPC 
sometimes gave 
a few colonies 

Red 

Blue 

why would lower [template] be good? 
•competing for other reagents (primers, etc.) 
•or inhibitor diluted 

Today in Lab


•  Set up gel: runs 45 min, we will photograph it.

– Mark your area with coloured tape 
•  Meanwhile, notebooks/hw/etc. 
•  Finally, bacterial transformation – be gentle!
