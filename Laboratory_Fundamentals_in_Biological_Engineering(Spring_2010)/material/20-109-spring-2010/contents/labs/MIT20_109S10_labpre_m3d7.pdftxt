– Afterward, lab party at  12 ‐1:30 pm (RSVP) 
•  Final self‐assessment 
– Optional (due to term regs), but would be nice to 
hear your input 
– Can hand in by email, by Thursday the 13th 

ELISA analysis 

unknowns 

CN II/I ratios; also absolute values potentially. 
if latter very small, former is meaningless. 

Final assignments, etc.


•	 Report: what do I need to know to understand and 
repeat your experiment, given OWW access? 
¾  Experimental plan – alginate, cells (type/#) 
¾  Amount and quality of RNA 
¾  RT-PCR analysis method 
¾  ELISA level of replicate agreement

¾  (Not an exhaustive list!)

•	 Research proposals 
¾  Rubric is online (Assignments page) 
¾  Specify a question and experiments to address it 
¾ Make clear what is novel aspect(s) 
•	 Clean-up!

Optional discussion of data 

•	 Looking at live cell count vs. live cell % 
•	 Understanding transcript assay mechanics 
•	 What if protein and transcript assays suggest 
different conclusions? 
low absolute conc.; differentiated 
�  technical reasons	
degradation rates for I vs. II; 
�  biological reasons	
pepsin rates for I vs. II; 
snapshot vs. cumulative; processing/export 

•optimized for ~100ng template 
•ELISA – absolute [protein] 
•RT‐PCR – relative to benchmark/each
