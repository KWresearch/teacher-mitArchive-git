•	 Obtain DE3 in mid‐log phase, make 
competent 
–  1 hour incubation  0.4 – 0.6 OD 
(keep in mind 1:10)

•	 Extract DNA from two mutant candidates 
•	 Transform DE3 with the extracted DNA 
–	 ½ hour incubation 
•	 During incubation(s): count mutant colonies, 
set up diagnostic digests and sequencing rxns 
–  digest 1+  hour, we will stop digests if end past 5 pm
