Lab work is divided into three modules of eight sessions each. Learning
materials for each lab session (linked below under 'Lab Materials') include an
introduction, experimental protocol, and a reagents list, followed by a "for
next time" homework assignment. A short pre-lab lecture preceeds most of the
lab sessions.
Selected results from some labs are included courtesy of the students and used
with permission.

First Day: Lab Orientation
There are ten stations for you and your lab partner to visit on your lab tour
today. Some will be guided tours with a TA or faculty there to help you and
others are self-guided, leaving you and your partner to try things on your own.
Your visit to each station should last ~10-15 minutes. It doesn't matter which
station you visit first but you must visit them all before you leave today.
Afterward, you should have some time remaining to begin the For Next Time
assignment, and are strongly encouraged to do so. Your lab practical next time
will assess your mastery of a selection of these stations - all are fair game,
as is the lab safety material covered in today's pre-lab lecture.

Module 1: RNA Engineering
Instructors: Jacquin Niles and Agi Stachowiak
In this module you will investigate RNA aptamer selection. You may already be
familiar with peptides or proteins, such as antibodies, that bind to specific
molecules. Short fragments of RNA â called RNA aptamers - can have secondary
structures that also allow them to bind a target molecule with good affinity
and specificity. Normally, RNA aptamers that bind particular targets are found
by screening many candidates at random in a process called SELEX, or systematic
evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment; however, predictive
computational tools can also be used. In the coming weeks, you will essentially
perform one round of SELEX. Because SELEX typically takes several rounds to
isolate target-binding aptamers, you will start with a known aptamer mixture
rather than than a completely random library. Your goal will be to explore what
experimental parameters affect the enrichment of a heme-binding RNA aptamer
from a mixture of heme-binding and non-binding RNAs.

discussions and for acquiring funding for module development.

Module 2: Protein Engineering
Instructors: Alan Jasanoff and Agi Stachowiak
In this experiment, you will modify a protein called inverse pericam (developed
by Nagai,_et_al.) in order to affect its functions as a sensor. Inverse pericam
(IPC) comprises a permuted fluorescent protein linked to a calcium sensor. The
"inverse" in the name refers to the fact that this protein shines brightly in
the absence of calcium, but dimly once calcium is added. The dissociation
constant KD of wild-type IPC with respect to calcium is reported to be 0.2 Î¼M
(see also figure below). Your goal will be to shift this titration curve or
change its steepness by altering one of the calcium binding sites in IPC's
calcium sensor portion. You will modify inverse pericam at the gene level using
a process called site-directed mutagenesis, express the resultant protein in a
bacterial host, and finally purify your mutant protein and assay its calcium-
binding activity via fluorescence. In the course of this module, we will
consider the benefits and drawbacks of different approaches to protein design,
and the types of scientific investigations and applications enabled by
fluorescently tagged biological molecules.

Engineered_to_Sense_Ca2+." PNAS 98, no. 6 (March 6, 2001): 3197-3202. [Open

We gratefully acknowledge 20.109 instructor Natalie Kuldell for helpful
discussions during the development of this module, as well as for her prior
work in developing a related_module in the Spring 2007 course.

Raw titration curve for IPC. Shown here is sample data from the teaching lab:
normalized fluorescence for wild-type inverse pericam as a function of calcium
concentration. As you will later learn, an apparent KD can be estimated from
such a plot: it is the point on the x-axis where the curve crosses y = 50%, or
~0.5 Î¼M here
[labs_m2_fig2.jpg]
Fitted titration curve for IPC. A more sophisticated analysis using curve-
fitting reveals KD to be ~ 0.3 Î¼M, closer to the reported value for inverse
pericam.

Module 3: Cell-Biomaterial Engineering
Instructor: Agi Stachowiak
What makes a cell become one type and not another? How can we influence this
process, and why would we even want to? When faced with conflicting information
â in our own experiments, or in the broader scientific literature â how do
we determine what is credible? These are just some of the questions you will
explore in the third and final module, all in the context of tissue
engineering. The goal of tissue engineering (also called regenerative medicine)
is to repair tissues damaged by acute trauma or disease. Repair is stimulated
by insertion of a porous scaffold at the wound or disease site; the scaffold
may carry relevant mature or progenitor cells, and in some cases also soluble
growth factors. In cartilage tissue, mature cells are called chondrocytes, and
their progenitor cells are mesenchymal stem cells. Tissue regeneration shares
many characteristics with natural tissue development, including the importance
of appropriate cell differentiation and phenotype maintenance. You will perform
a hypothesis-driven investigation of the effects of environmental manipulations
on primary chondrocytes and/or mesenchymal stem cells. In particular, you will
assess cell viability, genotype, and protein production, but the specific
experimental question is up to you.
I gratefully acknowledge Professor Alan Grodzinsky and several members of his
lab group (particularly Rachel Miller and Paul Kopesky), for their technical
advice and stimulating discussions during the development of this module.
