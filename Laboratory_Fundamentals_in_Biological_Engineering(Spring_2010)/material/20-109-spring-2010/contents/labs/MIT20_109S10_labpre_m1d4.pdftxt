M1D4 Workflow

Remember to use RNase-free equipment and technique! 
Keep all RNA on ice when not in use. 

1.  DNase treatment (30’), 
prepare spin columns 

We will check your HW calcs 
and let you know if correct. 

5. Run RNA through column 
6. Begin RNA  precipitation 

2. Measure [RNA] using spec. 
Calculate if you have enough 
to proceed – talk to us if not! 

3. Dilute and denature RNA 
Goal: start by ~ 2:30-3 

4. Incubate RNA with beads 
Goal: start by ~ 3-3:30 
Add tRNA to “cover” agarose 
(RNA binds non-specifically)
