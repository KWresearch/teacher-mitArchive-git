The materials in this course offer a mixture of discursive and narrative texts
dealing with a variety of evolutionary issues. In this class, we read what many
thinkers and writers have had to say about one of the great human questions:
how the realm we call nature defines our existence. Your reading and discussion
of authors who have considered this question will help provide you with a
historical foundation for understanding a rich literary tradition, as well as
many assumptions held by people in many contemporary cultures. There will be
about 100 pages of weekly readings â sometimes less, sometimes more.

                                                           1. To what extent, if any, do you think Malthus's concept of the Natural
                                                           Inequality holds in an age of advanced technology? Does technology have the

                                                           2. According to Adam Smith, selfâinterest drives the development of an economy
                                                           that benefits everyone by providing more opportunity. This selfâinterest could
                                                           be argued to be instinctual, unâselfâconscious behavior. In Malthus's system,
                                                           instinct, which may lead to the development of an economy, leads also to the
                                                           production of excess population. Can the views of Smith and Malthus be

                                                           2. To what extent do Hyde's personality traits draw on instincts all primates,
                                                           including humans, share?

                                                           4. Are there any Darwinian interpretations we can place on the JekyllâHyde

                                                           1. Huxley speaks of the State of Nature (Section 1, pp. 1â5)) and the Human
                                                           State of Art (Section 2, pp. 9â11), and the two in a state of conflict with
                                                           each other (Section 3, pp. 11â3). Is this a valid way of thinking about the
                                                           human relationship with its conditions of existence?
21      Huxley, Prolegomena to Evolution and Ethics.       2. What are some of the implications of Huxley's analogy of human culture and the
                                                           colony (Section 5, pp. 16â7).
                                                           3. On p. 20, Huxley states that humans compete in evolutionary terms not by
                                                           struggling with each other but by controlling their conditions of existence. What
                                                           are the implications of this human strategy?
                                                           4. In Section 7 (pp. 20â1), Huxley identifies the serpent in the human Garden
                                                           of Eden. What is the serpent and how integral a part of human existence is this
                                                           force?
                                                           5. In Section 10 (pp. 26â30), Huxley expands on the human condition as one in
                                                           which humans carry within themselves the seeds of their own destruction. Does
                                                           this view share anything with the view of Voltaire in Candide? How is Huxley's
                                                           view different from that of Voltaire?

22      H. G. Wells, The Time Machine.                     1. Compare the dystopian visions of Wells and Butler. Both use evolutionary
                                                           themes, but in very different ways.
                                                           2. Could human society regress in the way that Wells suggests in his
                                                           characterization of the Eloi and Morlocks?
                                                           3. Are Wells's creatures reminiscent of Stevenson's Jekyll and Hyde in any way?
                                                           4. Does Wells's novel reflect any of the problems of Huxley's Evolution and
                                                           Ethics?
