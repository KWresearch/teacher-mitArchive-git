***** Course Description *****
This course introduces the fundamental Lean Six Sigma principles that underlay
modern continuous improvement approaches for industry, government and other
organizations. Lean emerged from the Japanese automotive industry, particularly
Toyota, and is focused on the creation of value through the relentless
elimination of waste. Six Sigma is a quality system developed at Motorola which
focuses on elimination of variation from all processes. The basic principles
have been applied to a wide range of organizations and sectors to improve
quality, productivity, customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, time-to-
market and financial performance.
This course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is
a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the
end of the month.
