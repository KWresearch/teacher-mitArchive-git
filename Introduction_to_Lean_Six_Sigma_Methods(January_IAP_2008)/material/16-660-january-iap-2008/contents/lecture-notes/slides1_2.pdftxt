Lean Journey 

Learning Objectives 

At the end of this module, you will be able to: 
• Explain the origins of lean and six sigma

• Explain the “5S” lean tool 
• Define Lean, lean enterprise and

stakeholders

• Recognize why lean six sigma principles 
are being implemented in aerospace. 
• Express that lean is a “journey” not a

“state”

Lean and Six Sigma 
• Transformation initiatives are often based on elements of 
Lean and Six Sigma 
•	 Lean optimizes flow and strives to eliminate waste 
•	 Six Sigma stresses quality through the elimination of variation 
in all enterprise processes 
•	 A unified framework called Lean Six Sigma has emerged 
•	 Enterprises usually adopt their own name. Some examples: 
•  US Air Force - AFSO21 
•	 Textron - Textron Six Sigma 
•	 Pratt & Whitney - ACE 
•  Boeing - Lean+ 
•	 Rockwell Collins - Lean Electronics

5S Exercise - 1

•	 We will apply 5S to a workplace and measure 
the improvement in executing our job. 
•	 During each 30 second shift, your job is to 
strike out the numbers 1 to 49 in order 
•	 The first page of numbers represents our 
current workplace 
•	 Ready… Set…

•	 The first “S” is Sort 
•  We have removed 
numbers between 50 and 
90 which are not needed
