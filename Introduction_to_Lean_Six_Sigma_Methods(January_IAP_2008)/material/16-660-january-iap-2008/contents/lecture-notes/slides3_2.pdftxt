•	 System processes chips 
(each time period, move a quantity of chips from one person to the next) 
•	 Roll of dice determines how many chips are moved 
•	 CANT PASS MORE CHIPS THAN YOU HAVE IN YOUR 
“IN” BIN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ROUND 
•	 Let’s work through a couple cycles

What Should happen?


•  Consider 20 time periods, or “days” 
•	 Each day, 3.5 chips are processed on 
average (the average of  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) 
•  Intuitively, what  should be the average

throughput? Over 10 days?  Over 20?

•  What is the ideal flow (elapsed) time? 

Let’s find out what really happens…

Accounting

•	 After 20 days, each person should add the 
appropriate columns to carry out the 
calculations at the bottom of their tally 
sheet 
•	 The customer does slightly more complex 
calculations (use calculator if needed) 

Let’s tabulate some results 

Variability Simulation V6.2- Slide  12

Questions

•	 Why are fewer jobs processed than 
expected?  Why is flow time longer? 

•	 How might the performance of this system 
be improved?

Computer Simulation

•  We can more rapidly gather experimental data

with a computer simulation of the dice game

•	 We can easily change customer input (invoice 
arrival) and process step variation to see the 
impact. 
•	 Look at the impact of input and process 
variability on cycle time after 20 and 216 days 
•	 For each simulation, write down the following 
data 
•	 Invoices/day, WIP, Cycle time 
•	 Then multiply (Invoices/day) x (Cycle time)

Takes about 8 cycles to work through the system

Using Little’s Law:

Cycle Time = WIP / (Throughput Rate ) = 8.3

Simulation: Summary


•	 Simulated the system to examine behavior 
over a longer time period, more replications 
•	 We made several improvements that 
demonstrate the power of a lean philosophy: 
•	 Reduced INPUT variability 
•	 Reduced PROCESS variability 
•  Less variability and some “excess” capacity

allowed response to customer need - Pull

•  Eliminating variability allowed straight-through 
flow to customer demand - Perfection

Take Aways 
•	 Lean thinking and tools apply to office 
processes 
•	 A structured process analysis can lead to 
identifying many opportunities for 
improvement 
•	 Changing the theoretical process is not the 
only change required for successfully 
transforming an organization (management 
practices and structure determine behavior!) 
•	 Variability reduces expected process 
performance
