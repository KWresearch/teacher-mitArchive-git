Five Lean Thinking 
Fundamentals 

•	 Specify value: Value is defined by customer in terms of 
specific products and services 

•	

Identify the value stream: Map out all end-to-end linked 
actions, processes and functions necessary for 
transforming inputs to outputs to identify and eliminate 
waste 
•	 Make value flow continuously: Having eliminated waste, 
make remaining value-creating steps “flow” 
•	 Let customers pull value: Customer’s “pull” cascades all the 
way back to the lowest level supplier, enabling just-in-time 
production 
•	 Pursue perfection: Pursue continuous process of 
improvement striving for perfection

Value Stream Map (VSM)

•	 A tool used to improve a process by identifying 
added value and eliminating waste 
•	 A process map with process data added 
•	 Some examples of process data 
•	 Times: processing, wait, cycle 
•	 Quality: number of rejects 
•	
Inventory 
•	 Resources 
•  Number of people 
•  Space 
•  Distance traveled 
•  Whatever else is useful for analyzing the process 

Only value-added data and graphics should be used!

Steps for Creating a VSM


1.	 Define customer value 
2.	 Create a “current state” map 
•	
“Walk” the process to identify tasks and flows 
•	 Gather data on resources, time, quality for each 
3.	 Analyze map to determine opportunities for 
improvement 
•	
Identify value-added and waste 
•	
Brainstorm actions to eliminate waste and add value 
4.	 Create “future-state” map to visualize the desired 
state 
5.	 Create action plans to move towards future-state

Summary - S&A Value Stream 
Analysis (VSA) 
•	 Current production (50 customers) is a little below 
current capacity (64 customers) of Andy and Sasha 
•	 Process improvement needed to meet growing 

demand

•	 Andy and Sasha are both underutilized 
•	 But utilization is not balanced between them 
•	 Cycle time of 7.43 min per customer too long 
•	 Should be able to shorten cycle time to meet

demands of customers for faster service


Bottom Line

Bottom Line
Sasha and Andy should implement process

Sasha and Andy should implement process
improvement for week 3 to meet growing demand!

Improvement Brainstorm


Sasha 

Andy 

•	 Help Sasha and Andy figure what to improve 
•	 How can utilization be improved? 
•	 How can cycle time be reduced? 
•	 What has to be done to serve 75 customers? 
•	 What has to be done to serve 100 customers? 
•	 Spend 10 minutes with teams and then discuss 
with class

Why is VSM a Useful Tool?


•	 Helps visualize interactions and flows 
•	 Shows linkages between information and product 
flows 
•	 Provides a common language for talking about a 
process 
•	 Helps to identify: 
•	 the constraint(s) - any resource whose capacity is 
less than customer demand; 
•	 wastes as well as their sources

Tips for Creating a VSM


•	
Involve entire team 
•	 Actually walk the process - follow the material 
and information through the process, starting 
at the beginning 
•	 Use Post-it notes and butcher paper 
•	 Use symbols or icons that are meaningful to 
the process but common enough to be 
understood by all involved
