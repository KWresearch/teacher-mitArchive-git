What is a Process?


Inputs 

Set of actions 
which transform 
inputs to outputs 

Outputs 

Process: A series of actions, changes, or 
functions bringing about a result 

Ref: http://www.dictionary.com, Jan. 8, 2003

Identify the Customer


•  What happens to the outputs of a process? 


They go to a CUSTOMER!

•	 External customers - are outside an organization, 
money is typically exchanged with external customers 
•	 End users are customers who pay for an 
operational or consumable product or service 

•	

Internal customers - are inside an organization, 
money is typically not exchanged directly with 
internal customers 
•	 Customers also drive the inputs to a process through 
their needs and requirements

•	 Only understood processes can be improved 
•	 Understanding a process is easier when it can be 
visualized 
•	 A Process Map is an organized visualization of all the 
interrelated activities which combine to form a process

Process Wrap Up


•	 Processes underlay everything we do 
•	 The fundamentals of lean thinking provide 
the foundation to modern process 
improvement 
•	 Understanding and improving processes is 
the key to improving productivity

Five Lean Thinking 
Fundamentals 
•	 Specify value: Value is defined by customer in terms 
of specific products and services 
•	

Identify the value stream: Map out all end-to-end 
linked actions, processes and functions necessary for 
transforming inputs to outputs to identify and 
eliminate waste 
•	 Make value flow continuously: Having eliminated 
waste, make remaining value-creating steps “flow” 
•	 Let customers pull value: Customer’s “pull” cascades 
all the way back to the lowest level supplier, enabling 
just-in-time production 
•	 Pursue perfection: Pursue continuous process of 
improvement striving for perfection

Value Added and Non Value 
Added 

Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull 

Perfection


Value Added Activity 
•	 Transforms or shapes material or information or people 
•	 And it’s done right the first time 
•	 And the customer wants it 

Non-Value Added Activity – Necessary Waste 
•	 No value is created, but cannot be eliminated based on current 
technology, policy, or thinking 
•	 Examples: project coordination, regulatory, company mandate, law 

Non-Value Added Activity - Pure Waste 
•	 Consumes resources, but creates no value in the eyes of the 
customer 
•	 Examples: idle/wait time, inventory, rework, excess checkoffs

Making Value Flow


Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull 

Perfection 

Flow requires: 
•  Understanding of time 
•  Process control 
•  Eliminating bottlenecks and stoppages 
•  Eliminating unplanned rework 

Creating flow: 
•  Focus on the product or service that is flowing 
through the process 
•  Don’t be limited by organizational or functional 
boundaries

Perfection 
•	 Time is an essential metric for lean 
improvement 
•	 There are different ways to measure time

•	 Wait time 
•	 Processing time 
•	 Cycle time

Sasha
Andy
•	 Calculate the time in seconds for the 11 process steps 
and the total cycle time. 
•	 Note: make sure to convert everything to time per 
order 
•	 Allocate the work to each member of the team (balance 
the workload - a lean practice!); e.g. 
•	 1 member to record results on flip chart 
•	 1 person calculate T/O for steps 1-3, another for 4-6, a 
third for 7-9 and the fourth for steps 10-11. 
•	 Give calculated T/O to recorder to calculate CT

What is a Pull System?


Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull 
Perfection 
•	 Pull means that no one produces a good or 
service or processes material or information until 
someone downstream has requested it 
•	 All value is pulled by the end customer or user of 
the product or service 

•	

Inherently, there is very little waste in a pull 
system 
•	 Pull systems are agile and responsive to 
customer demand

Moving from Flow to Pull 


Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull 

Perfection 

Pull requires Flow plus predicable cycle time, using

•	 Takt time 
•	 Balanced work 
•	 Standard work 
•	 Single piece flow 
•	 Kanban system 
•	 Just in time delivery of all material and information 

Creating Pull: 
•	 Start with the customer and work backwards through the 
system 
•	
If  cycle time <=  lead time  then Pull can be

accomplished

•	
If  cycle >  lead time  then buffer inventory is used that 
can be pulled immediately

“OPTIONS DECISIONS” on-line or via phone 
•	 Credit Card  # Initiates the “Pull” Process 
•	 Suppliers are on-line with DELL re: Order 
Placement / Computer Configuration 
•	 Production Of 27,000 Computers / Day 
•	 Orders Shipped in 1 Day 
•	 Zero Inventory carry costs

Takt Time -
Measure of Customer Demand 
Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull 
Perfection 

Takt Time is… 
•	
from the German word for 
meter which establishes the 
pace or beat 
•	 a reference number that 
provides a drum beat for the 
process 

available time 

Takt Time = 
customer demand 
rate for available time 

Example:

The available time is a year or 235 days.

There are 40 orders for this year.


What is the Takt time?


235/40 ~  6 days

•	 Processing multiple 
units at the same time 
•	 Number of units in work 
optimizes the efficiency 
at each step in the 
process 
•	 High inventory levels

Perfection 

Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull 
•	 Visual control helps identify the 
status of the process at a glance 
•	 Makes the process apparent 
to everyone involved with or 
observing it 
•	 Only valuable if used for active 
process management 

Photograph of work control board removed
due to copyright restrictions.

•	 Andon is a specific visual control device, typically a group 
of lights indicating the current status of the process 
•	 Each step has a set of lights which indicates whether the 
step is proceeding as planned, needs monitoring, or 
requires immediate attention 
In a pull system, if action is required, the entire process 
stops to correct the problem

5 Whys Example:

It gets washed all the time. 

Why? 
Why? 
It always has bird droppings on it. 

Why?  The birds come into the monument to feed on spiders.

Why?  The spiders are there feeding on gnats.

Why?  The gnats are there because the lights are left on all 

the time.
