Why Do We Care About Quality?


Hidden Costs of Non-Conformance = 6 to

50X Measured Costs

•  Direct Measured Costs: 
•  Scrap/rework 
•  Service calls 
•  Warranties/concessions 

Photo by Earll Murman 

Indirect/Hidden Costs: 
•  Excess inventory 
•  Overtime 
•  Non-value added steps 
•  Queues and delays 
•  Reputation/image

Problems with Inspection 
Based Quality Control 

•	

•	

Inspection does not add 
value to the customer – it 
simply screens or detects 
(most of the time) defective 
products from leaving the 
factory. 
Inspection is subject to 
multiple errors 
•	
Inspector skill and attention 
•	 Measurement capability 
•	 Environment (Human Factors)

Inspection Exercise


1.  This exercise will be timed.


2.  Task:  Circle all of the fs or Fs  on a page of text.


3.  After 30 seconds – “STOP” and count up the

total number of fs and Fs that you found! 


4.  Take out the “F” Exercise from the student folder


5.  When I say “GO” you may begin.

Product and Process Quality 
Defined 
•	 Product Quality is the conformance to customer 
specifications within a tolerance band 
•  The upper and lower values that the customer 
is willing to accept are known as upper and 
lower specification limits (USL and LSL) 
•  Process Quality is a measure of the capability of

a process to produce to its expected capability

•  The upper and lower values between which the 
process must be controlled are known as 
upper and lower control limits (UCL and LCL)

Statistical Process Control


•	 Control charting is the primary tool of SPC 
•	 Control charts provide information about the 
stability/predictability of the process, 
specifically with regard to its: 
•	 Central Tendency (to target value) 
•	 Variation 
•	 SPC charts are time-sequence charts of 
important process or product characteristics

Types of Process Variation 
•	 Common Cause Variation is the sum of many 
‘chances causes,’ none traceable to a single 
major cause. Common cause variation is 
essentially the noise in the system. When a 
process is operating subject to common cause 
variation it is in a state of statistical control. 
•	 Special Cause Variation is due to differences 
between people, machines, materials, methods, 
etc. The occurrence of a special (or assignable) 
cause results in an out of control condition. 

Control Charts provide a means for distinguishing between

Assessing Process 
Capability 
Cp, a term used to define 
process capability, is 
mathematically 
expressed by: 

Cp = 2 
Cp = 1.33 
Cp = 1 
Cp = .67

distributions with various 
C levels.  Note C s less

outside the acceptable 
limits.

Non-Centered Distributions 

Center 

If the distribution is off 
center, the probability of a 
bad result drastically 
increases.  In this case Cpk 
is used. It is the smaller  of 

Cpk = 1.5 
Cpk = .83 
Cpk = .50 
Cpk = .17 

LSL 

USL

or 

Very Bad 

This figure shows the same 
distributions off-center by 
1.5σ.  The Cpks are smaller 
than the corresponding 
C s.  This illustrates the
p
need to both control 
variation and accurately hit 
the desired mean.

Cp versus Cpk 

In this case, the 
shooter (archer) has a 
bad eye – the shots are 
widely dispersed and 
slightly off-center 

Cp is high 
Cpk  is high 

C  is low 
p
Cpk  is low 

In this case, the 
shooter (archer) has a 
good eye, but all the 
shots are off-center 

In this case, the shooter 
(archer) has a good eye, 
and has now adjusted the 
gun (bow) sight to bring 
the shots on target 

Cp is high 
Cpk  is low

Process Capability


•	 Once we have a process in control then we can 
answer the question of whether the process is 
capable of meeting the customer’s 
specifications. 
•	 “Process Capability is broadly defined as the 
ability of a process to meet customer 
expectations” (Bothe, 1997)

Strategy for Using Control 
Charts 

•	

In early stages, control charts (usually on 
output variables) are used to understand the 
behavior of the process 
•	 After corrective actions, place charts on 
critical input variables 
•	
If a chart has been implemented, remove it if it 
is not providing valuable and actionable 
information 
•	 The goal: Monitor and control inputs and, over 
time, eliminate the need for SPC charts by 
having preventative measures in place

What is Six Sigma? 

Strategy… a data driven philosophy 
and process resulting in dramatic 
shifts in way a company behaves, 
treats its customers, and produces 
products/services. Measurement… 
Measurement of the variation of a 
process…standard deviation. 
Translates into process 
performance…defects per million 
(DPM). 

The goal of Six Sigma is to reduce process variation

Defects


•	

Improving quality means reducing the defects 
per million opportunities (DPMO).  There are 
two attributes to this metric that can be 
controlled: 
•  Opportunities – reducing the number of parts, 
joints, fasteners, and other “opportunities” will 
help improve quality – lean engineering 
•  Defects – reducing the number of defects by 
reducing the amount of process variation – Six 
Sigma

When Can Six Sigma Be Used?

•	 There are two major forms of Six Sigma, 
each of which apply to specific phases 
within a product’s lifecycle: 
•	 Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) 
• Used to analyze and improve a product’s 
(or service’s) key quality characteristics 
and to develop robust processes to 
produce the product (or service) 
•	 “Traditional” Six Sigma Methodology 
• Typically used throughout the production 
stages of a product’s lifecycle 

Quality Tools and Topics V6.3- Slide 34 
© 2008 Massachusetts  Institute of Technology 

Six Sigma Methodology 
•	 There are five fundamental steps in the Six Sigma 
DMAIC process: 
•	 Define – 
•	 Who are the customers and what are their problems? 
•	 Identify key characteristics important to the customer. 
•	 Measure – 
•	 Categorize key input and output characteristics, verify 
measurement systems 
•	 Collect data and establish the baseline performance 
•	 Analyze – 
•	 Convert raw data into information to provide insights into the 
process 
Improve – 
•	 Develop solutions to the problem and compare the results to 
the baseline performance 
•	 Control – 
•  Monitor the process to assure no unexpected changes occur

What is DFSS?


Design for Six Sigma 
•  A methodology for designing new products 
and/or processes 
•  A methodology for re-designing existing 

products and/or processes 

•  A way to implement Six Sigma methodology as 
early in the product or service life cycle 
•  A way to “design in” quality when costs are 
lowest

Comparison of Lean & Six 
Sigma Approaches 

Six Sigma 

Lean 

Reduce variation 
1. Define 
2. Measure 
3. Analyze 
4. Improve 
5. Control 

Problem focused 
•  A problem exists 
•  Figures and numbers are 
valued 
•  System output improves 
if variation in all 
processes inputs is 
reduced 

Remove waste 
1. Identify Value 
2. Identify Value Stream 
3. Flow 
4. Pull 
5. Perfection 

Flow focused 
•  Waste removal will 
improve business 
performance 
•  Many small 
improvements are better 
than system analysis

Lean and Six Sigma… 
Merging Process Improvement Approaches 
•	 Lean And Six Sigma are merging into a unified 
framework for enterprise change 
•	 Lean optimizes flow, reduces cycle time, and 
eliminates waste (including the waste of poor 
quality) 
•	 Six Sigma provides a means for measuring quality 
•	
for improving individual processes 
•	
for measuring performance improvement across the

enterprise

•	 Lean strives for speed through continuous “drum-
beat” flow… Six Sigma strives for quality through 
elimination of variation 

Continuous flow cannot be achieved without 
Continuous flow cannot be achieved without
high quality processes

Discussion and Take Aways 

•	 Quality is essential to lean – not a competitor 
Why? 
•	 Process and product quality are linked 
How? 
•	 A variety of tools are available for determining 
and improving quality 
What are some? 
•	 Six sigma is a valuable concept in achieving 
customer satisfaction 
Why?
