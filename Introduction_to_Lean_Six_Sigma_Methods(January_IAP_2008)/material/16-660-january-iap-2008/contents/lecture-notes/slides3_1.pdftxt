Value Stream Mapping 

Learning Objectives


At the end of this module, you will be able to: 
•	 Use a case study to practice applying 
concepts 
•	 Apply lean thinking and analysis tools to an 
office process 
•	 Sketch a future state value stream map 
•	 Recall the impact that variability has on 
process performance

Steps for Creating a VSM 

1.	 Define customer value 
2.	 Create a “current state” map 
•	
“Walk” the process to identify tasks and flows

•	 Gather data on resources, time, quality for

each 

3.	 Analyze map to determine opportunities for 
improvement 
•	
Identify value-added and waste 
•	 Brainstorm actions to eliminate waste and add 
value 
4.	 Create “future-state” map to visualize the desired 
state 
5.	 Create action plans to move towards future-state

AP Future State VSM

•	 Regroup with your team and sketch a future 
state process map for Accounts Payable 
using postits. 
•  Identify what some of the unknowns are that

you would need information on to finish the

process map and add data to make a VSM


•	 The class will conclude with discussion of a 
candidate future state VSM

General Tips for Creating 
Future State VSM 
•	 Visualize what the “ideal state” would be 
•	 Reflect on the goals and constraints given by your 
sponsor 
•	 Consider what from that can be achieved in the “future 
state” 
•	 Maybe there are constraints which limit what can be 
done now 
•	 What is the expected takt time? Can you achieve it? 
•	 What is the expected lead time? Can you achieve it? 
•	 Are process and information flows clear and visible? 
•	
Include actual or estimated times, resources, etc.

Wrap Up


•	 Case studies are a useful approach for 
learning how to apply lean tools for “beyond 
the shop floor” activities. 
•	 A data driven VSM approach can identify 
where the real bottlenecks are. 
•	 Drawing a future state VSM requires insight 
into what is possible in any given situation.
