Learning Objectives 

At the end of this module, you will be able to: 
•	 Explain how lean principles and practices 
apply to  engineering 
•	 Explain why customer value and the “front 
end” of engineering are critical to product 
success 
•	 Describe how lean engineering enables lean 
in the enterprise and throughout the product 
lifecycle 
•	 Describe tools for lean engineering

Seven Wastes Revisited 


1. Over-production 

Creating too much material or information 

2. Inventory 

Having more material or information than 
you need 

3. Transportation 

Moving material or information 

4. Unnecessary Movement 

5. Waiting 

6. Defective Outputs 

7. Over-processing 

Moving people to access or process 
material or information 
Waiting for material or information, or 
material or information waiting to be 
processed 
Errors or mistakes causing the effort to 
be redone to correct the problem 
Processing more than necessary to 
produce the desired output

• Time is wasted

VSM Applied to Product 
Development 
•	 Same basic techniques apply 
•	 Flows are knowledge and information 
flows rather than physical products 
•	 Process steps may overlap or involve 
planned iterations 
•	 Value added steps add or transform 
knowledge, or reduce uncertainty 
(role of analysis steps) 
•	 Quantifies key parameters for each 
activity  (cycle time, cost, quality 
defects, inventory, etc.) 
•	 Provides systematic method to 
improve a process by eliminating 
waste

Engineering Drives Cost!


80% of a product’s cost is determined by the 
engineering design: 
•  Number of parts / tolerances 
•  Assembly technique (fasteners, EB welding, co-cure)

•  Processes (heat treat, shot peen, etc.) 
•  Tooling approach (matched metal dies, injection 

molding, etc.)

•  Materials (titanium, aluminum, composites, etc.) 
•  Avionics / software 
•  Design complexity 
•  Design re-use

•  Integrated Product Teams (IPTs): Incorporates 
knowledge about all lifecycle phases

Part Count Reduction: DFMA


•	 Why reduce part count? 
•	 Reduce recurring & non-recurring cost

• Reduce design, manufacturing, 
assembly, testing and inspection work 
•	 Reduce inventory 
•	 Reduce maintenance spares 
•	 Sometimes requires “performance” trades, 
but not always – and cost and schedule 
savings are typically significant

Lego Simulation DFMA 
Exercise 

Redesign the airplane!  Rules: 
•  Satisfy customer 
•  Moldline (outside shape) must remain exactly the same 
•  Landing gear (and only landing gear) must be brown 
•  In-service quality must improve 
•  Increase delivery quantities 
•  Reduce manufacturing costs 
•  Part count ($5/part) 
•  Less parts = more capacity 
•  Incorporate suppliers 
•  Innovations 
•  Reduced part diversity (?) 

Present your design to your facilitator 
Demonstrate it satisfies all criteria
