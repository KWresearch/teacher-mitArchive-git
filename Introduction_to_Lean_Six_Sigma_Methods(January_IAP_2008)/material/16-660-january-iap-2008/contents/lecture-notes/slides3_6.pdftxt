Implementing Lean 

Change?, Ha!


“I’ve learned three things about new programs:

•  Never oppose them; if you do you will get 
fired. 
•  Never do any work on them. 
•  In three months you will never hear about 
them again. 
I’ve been here 23 years, and I’ve seen 23 of

these things come and 23 of them go.”


(Auto Supplier Supervisor) 

D.V. Landvater, 1997.  World Class Production and Inventory Management, p.11

Success Requirements 
for a Journey 

Leadership


Commitment


The challenges of implementation: 
• Lean principles are simple - “a focused 
application of common sense1” 
• The challenge is implementing them -

and sustaining the transformation

• Transforming thinking into behavior and 
action is complex 
• Every journey is unique

Counterrmeasures  :
•Create continuous  flow  in  through Weld and Assembly
•Establish  Takt Time: Base the pace of work through Weld and Assembly on
customer demand
•Set new Weld-assembly cell as pacemaker for entire value stream
•Establish EPEX build schedule  for stamping based on actual use of pacemaker
cell and pull steel coils from supplier based on actual usage by Stamping.
•Reduce Changeover  time  in Stamping and Weld
•Improve uptime  in Weld
•Establish material handling  routes  for  frequent withdrawal and delivery
•Establish new production  instruction system with Leveling Box

Acme Stamping Steering Bracket Value Stream Improvement

Background
• Product: stamped-steel steering brackets  (left- and  right-hand drive).
• 18,400 brackets/month; daily shipments  in pallets of 10  trays of 20 brackets.
•Customer State Street Assembly  is requesting price cuts and tightening delivery
requirements.

Current Situation
•Production Lead  time:23.6 days
•Processing  time: only 188 seconds.
•Large  inventories of material between each process.
•Long changeover  times; downtime  in welding.

Analysis
•Each process operates as  isolated  islands, disconnected  from customer.
•Push system; material builds up between each process.
•Each process builds according  to  its own operating constraints  (changeover, downtime,
etc.
•Plans based on 90 and 30-day  forecasts  from customer.  Weekly schedule  for each
department. System  is  frequently  overidden  to make delivery.

A3 Exercise

•	 Join your team that prepared the Accounts 
Payable Value Stream Map 
•	 Develop an A3 plan to respond to Question 8 -
“Suppose your are the RPI team leader and 
have to report back to Joanie.  What will you 
recommend?” 
•	 Spend 20 minutes preparing your A3 plan 
•  Verify that the provided information is correct

•  Complete the additional information blocks

•	 Present the A3 to the class as if you were 
meeting with Joanie.

Project Selection


•	 Projects are identified from the Value Stream Map

•	 Determine the possible impact of each project on 
the enterprise 
•	 Do the anticipated results lead to the envisioned 
future state? 
•	 Possible analysis tools: 
•	 PICK charts  - simple and intuitive prioritization 
•	 Pareto charts - data driven prioritization 
•  Cost/Benefit analysis - prioritization based upon 
return on investment
