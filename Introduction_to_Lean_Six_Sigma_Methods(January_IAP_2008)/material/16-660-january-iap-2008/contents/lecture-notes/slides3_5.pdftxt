People: The Heart of Lean 

“There are two major distinctive features of these 
[Toyota Production and Kanban] systems. 

One of these is ‘just-in-time production’, an 
especially important factor in an assembly 
industry such as automotive manufacturing.… 

Second…is the ‘respect-for-human’ system 
where the workers are allowed to display in full 
their capabilities through active participation in 
running and improving their own workshops” 

Ref::Y. Sugimori, K. Kisunoki, F. Cho, S. Uchikawa,”Toyota Production System and 
Kanban Systems - Materialization of Just-In-Time and Respect-For-Human Systems”, 
International Journal of Production Research, Vol. 15, No. 6 (1977), pp. 553-64

Organizational Competency


“In this book I argue that 
Southwest’s most powerful 
organizational competency… 
is its ability to build and 
sustain high performance 
relationships … characterized 
by shared goals, shared 
knowledge, and mutual 
respect.  Although these 
relationships appear simple, 
appearances are deceptive.”

Relational Coordination

•	 Shared Goals aligns employees to prioritize 
organizational success over “just doing my job” 
•  SWA: Safety, Satisfied Customers, On-time Departure 
•	 Shared Knowledge enables visibility of the overall 
work process, and the linkages between different jobs 
•	 SWA: Functional groups help each other; Pilots help 
flight attendants, gate agents help baggage handlers,… 
•	 Mutual Respect reduces barriers between employees 
and employee groups 
•	 SWA: No one employee group is more important than 
another 

Supported by effective communication

From The Southwest Airlines Way 
•	 “With frequent, timely communication, 
Southwest employees could respond quickly to 
changing circumstances in a coordinated way.” 
•	 “…Southwest employees communicate about 
the problem itself, rather than assigning blame 
when difficulties occur.”

large and statistically significant.  This means you can be 
confident of achieving improved performance results if 
you can increase relational coordination.”

Relational Coordination 
Applies to Other Work Settings 
•	 Work setting characteristics where relational 
coordination applies 
•  Task interdependence - handoffs may require 
feedback and iterations 
•	 Uncertainty - adjustment of plans and updating 
•	 Time constraints - time buffers not feasible 
•	 Example work settings where relational

coordination applies

•	 Product development 
•	 Production 
•	 Operations 
•	 Can you think of others?

•  Leadership plays a key role at all levels 
•  What are characteristics of leadership and

how they related to management?

•  What are the roles of leadership and

management in a lean organization?

Three Elements of Collaboration 


•	 Task - What is being done together 
•	 Conceptualizing, problem solving, 
implementing 
•	 Process - How the task will be 
accomplished 
•	 Division and scheduling work, 
coordination, managing time and 
meetings, draft and revisions 
•	 Affect - Feelings about the work 
based upon: 
•	 Prior experiences, culture, biases 
•	 Current experience

How to Meet the Challenges 
of Collaboration 
•	 Elaborate key ideas in writing and 
verbally 
•	 Consider alternate ideas/solutions 
•	 Don’t jump to consensus prematurely 
•	 Pay careful attention to process 
•	 Voice disagreements constructively, 
directly, and explicitly 
•	 Give positive feedback directly and 
explicitly
