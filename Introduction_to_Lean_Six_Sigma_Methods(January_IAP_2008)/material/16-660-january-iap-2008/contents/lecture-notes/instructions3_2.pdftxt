Instructions for Using the Variability Simulation Spreadsheet 
The spreadsheet file “vari_sim3-2.xls” accompanies Slides 14-18 
in Module 3-2 and may be used for live simulations of  the performance of the 
accounts payable system due to variation of input arrivals and process 
performance. The sim tracks inventory at each in-box. It calculates average jobs 
complete per day, WIP, and cycle time after 20 and 216 days.  The plot shows 
the Inventory at each station by day for the 216 days. Note that every result is 
different and there is no steady pattern. 

1. 	 Open the spreadsheet. 
2. 	 Hit the Control or Command & = buttons to execute a simulation 
3. 	 The pink cells have pull down menus that allow you to change the die 
table 

The notes below go with each slide: 

Slide 14 – Usually, the sort of pattern seen here appears - jobs/day climb as the 
WIP grows (intuitively, as all of the inboxes fill, no capacity is ever lost to the die 
roll being greater than the inventory) but the cycle time gets terrible. The “luck” 
box is just a check on the random number generator - in this case, at 20 days, 
luck may make some difference (the computer generated die rolls have run 10% 
below expected average); by 216 days the bad luck continues but only accounts 
for 4% of the results, not enough to say that the mess we are seeing is due to 
“bad luck”. Usually the luck factor is even less significant (1-2%) as the computer 
rolls A LOT of simulated dice. 

Slide 15 - A bottleneck is created by having PFR Check use the 0,1,2,3,4,5 die. 
Masses of inventory accumulate there; WIP and Cycle Time grow without limit. 
Note this is unsubtle; Accounts Payable indeed does not have this sort of 
monster bottleneck. 

Slide 16 - Reducing input variation helps a little…  Its also worth trying a fully 
predictable input (all 3s) and a random but lower input level 0,1,2,3,4,5 - these 
help even more, but do not make the variability go away. 

Slide 17 - Reducing variability EVERYWERE helps A LOT 

Slide 18 - Finally, when customer demand is leveled AND variability is low, 
“perfection” is reached - a flow system!
