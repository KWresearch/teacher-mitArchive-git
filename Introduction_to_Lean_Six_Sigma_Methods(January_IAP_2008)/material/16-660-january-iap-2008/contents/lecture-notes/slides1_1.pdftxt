Why Icebreakers?


•	 Provides a common starting point – the

shared experience

•	 Gets everybody communicating 
•	 People tend to speak more “freely” amongst

people once they “know” – drives better

results

•	 Relieves tension 

Ref: Ice Breakers for all situations, William Wahlke, Benjie Gualco, Andrew Donlen, 
Boeing Lean Enterprise Conference, Fall 2005, Seattle.
