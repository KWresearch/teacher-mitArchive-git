S & A Hot Dogs


Sasha and Andy have opened a hot dog stand at their local park.  They offer a hot dog with choice of
fresh fruit and beverage to walk up customers between 10 AM and 2 PM. Customers put on their own
condiments. Customers say their hot dogs are good, but the wait is a little long. 
After two weeks, they have a brisk, and growing business. Andy and Sasha notice they are barely
keeping up with the customer demand, and making a little money after buying their supplies at the end
 
of each day.  They would like to improve their process to meet growing customer demand.  They
collected the following data for their business processes and need help analyzing it. 
T/O*
Data for average day 
Process step 
1  Sasha takes orders, collects
60 sec spent taking customer order customer
the money, and chats with the
50 customers per day
Average order is for 2 dog/fruit/beverage combos
walk up customers. 
2  Sasha tacks order-in on 
Order-in spends 30 sec on board 
Andy’s board. Andy takes
order from board. 
3  Andy gets a cooked hot dog.
If one isn’t already cooked,
Andy adds more dogs to the
grill trying to estimate
upcoming demand 
4  Andy puts dog in bun, wraps
it in foil, adds fruit of choice
and puts in serving container. 
If order isn’t complete, Andy
repeats steps 4-5. Otherwise
goes to step 2. 
6  Andy puts completed order on
Sasha’s counter 
7  Sasha checks the order 
8  Sasha adds beverage 
9  Sasha calls customer to stand,
delivers order and chats a bit 
10  Andy sets up his work area,
keeping it clean and stocked 
11  Sasha fills up condiments,
keeps serving counter clean,
and bags trash 

Order spends 30 sec on counter 
10 sec per order
10% of the orders returned to Andy
10 sec per order 
30 sec per customer 
10 min each hour 
10 min each hour 

Time spent to produce a cooked hot dog is 50 sec 

5 

Takes 20 sec per dog, about half the time spent
adding fruit and putting in serving container. 
10 sec per dog 

Cycle Time 

* T/O = Time per order in seconds.  Include rework time. 
As a first step, they have asked that you draw a process map for the above 11 Process Steps listed in the
left hand columns. Later you will work with the data.
