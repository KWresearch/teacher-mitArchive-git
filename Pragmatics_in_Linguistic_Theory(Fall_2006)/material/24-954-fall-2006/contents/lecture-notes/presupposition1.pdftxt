Notes on Presupposition 

[this  handout  largely  follows  Kai’s  notes  (on  the  website)  with  some  additions  and 
changes.  Most  of  the  examples  are  taken  from  there.  Parts  of  the  handout  follow  the 
discussion in Heim 1990.]

Introduction 

Two properties of presupposition: 

(i) 

(ii) 

“Taken for granted” 

Generally – but not always– inherited by complex containing structures. 

Property 1 

1) 

It was Sam who broke the typewriter. 

Presupposes:  Somebody broke the typewriter 
Asserts: Sam broke the typewriter. 

2) 

The mathematician who proved Goldbach’s conjecture is a woman. 

• 

3) 

Presupposes: there is a unique mathematician who proved Goldbach’s conjecture. 
Asserts: She is a woman. 

The “Hey, wait a minute” test (von Fintel, inspired by Shannon 1976).

Generalization:

(i)	
(ii)	

If A presupposes that p then A & B will also presuppose that p. 
If B  presup po ses  that  p,  then A & B and  will also  presup pose  that  p,  unless  A 
entails p ( together with assump tions in the context). 

Conditionals 

21) 
22) 
23) 

If this dish wasn’ t catered, then Harry’s wife is a great cook. 
If Harry is married,  then Harry’s wife is a great cook. 
If Harry’s wife is a great cook,  then Thanksgiving will be a success. 

Generalization 

(i)	
(ii)	

If  A presup po ses  that  p,  then  then if A, then B  will also presup po se that  p. 
If B presup po ses  that  p,  then if A, then B, then will also presup po se that  p, unless 
A entails p (together with assump tions in  the context.) 

Questions 

(i)	 What is the nature of presuppositions? 
(ii)	 How  can  we  account  for  the  inheritance  patterns?  The  Projection  Problem  for 
Presuppositions (= the Compositionality Problem for Presuppositions). 

2.	

The Stalnaker/Karttunen approach. 

Question (i) 

Presuppositions are admittance conditions. 

[Stalnaker (1973, 1974, 1979); Karttunen (1974).] 

•	

•	

Presuppositions are requirements on the common ground: B is a presupposition of S 
iff S can be felicitously uttered only in contexts whose common ground entails B. 

Roughly,  the  common  ground  of  a  context  is  the  set  of  propositions  that  the 
interlocutors take for granted in that context.

Accommodation. 

11/18/06 

24)	

I am sorry I am late. My car broke down (Heim 1990) 

"[...] it's not as easy as you might think to say something that will be unacceptable for
lack  of  required  presuppositions. 
Say  something  that  requires  a  missing 
presupposition,  and  straightway  that  presupposition  springs  into  existence,  making
what  you  said  acceptable  after  all.  (Or  at  least,  that  is  what  happens  if  your 
conversational partners tacitly acquiesce -- [...])".  (Lewis 1979)

Ease of accommodation 

25) 

I am sorry I am late. My helicopter broke down. 

26)  Oh dad. I forgot  to  tell you  that my fiancée and I are going to Seat tle for the 
weekend. 
(von Fintel, 2005 LSA lectures). 

• 

“Hard triggers”


27)  John lives in NYC too.


(see discussion in Heim 1990, and references therein).


Question 2: The Projection Problem 

•	

As Heim  1990  puts  it,  viewing  presuppositions  as  admittance  conditions  allows  us 
to formulate the projection problem in the following way: 

Given  a  sentence  like  if Harry  is married,  then Harry’s wife  is a good  cook, we 
don’t  ask  “how  can  the  presupposition  of  Harry’s  wife  is  a  good  cook  be 
blocked from ‘projecting up’?”, but rather “what in the utterance guarantees that the 
admittance condition is met?” 

How  come  a  context  that  doesn’t  entail  the  presupposition  of  Harry’s  wife  is  a 
good cook  can become good enough if you first utter if Harry’s is married.

Cf. context-dependency (examples from Heim 1990). 

28)	 She paid the rent. 

[requires  a  context  in  which  there  is  some  unique  maximally  salient  female 
individual] 

29)	

I shared the room with a police officer, and she paid the rent.

[can  be  uttered  in  a  context  where  there  is  not  a  unique  maximally  salient  female 
individual.] 

General  idea:  The  inheritance  properties  or  presuppositions  are  explained  by  the 
way the context  changes in a discourse. 

Stalnaker on conjunction: 

“Once  a  proposition  has  been  asserted  in  a  conversation,  then  (unless  or  until  it  is 
challenged)  the  speaker  can  reasonably  take  it  for  granted  for  the  rest  of  the 
conversation,  In particular, when a speaker says something of  the form A and B, he 
may  take  it  for  granted  that  A  (or  at  least  that  his  audience  recognizes  that  he 
accepts  that  A)  after  he  has  said  it.  The  proposition  that  A  will  be  added  to  the 
background  of  common  assumptions  before  the  speaker  asserts  that  B.  Now 
suppose  that  B  expresses  a  proposition  that  would,  for  some  reason,  be 
inappropriate to assert except in a context where A, or something entailed by A, is 
presupposed.  Even  if  A  is  not  presupposed  initially,  one  may  still  assert  A  and  B 
since by  the time one gets to saying  that B, the context has shifted, and  it is by  then 
presupposed that A.” 

Stalnaker on conditionals: 

“Here  we  need  first  the  assumption  that  what  is  explicitly  supposed  becomes 
(temporarily) a part of the background of common assumptions in 
subsequent 
conversation, and second that an if clause is an explicit supposition.” 

In  order  to  carry  out  the  Stalnaker/Karttunen  program,  we  need  “to  characterize 
somehow,  directly  or  indirectly,  how  the  context  is  changed  by  the  utterances  of 
complex  sentences  of  all  kinds,  what  each  component  of  the  utterance  contributes 
to  this  change,  and  which  stage  in  the  step-by-step  evolution  of  the  context  is  the 
relevant  one  for  the  admittance  of  each  elementary  constituent?”  (Heim  1990:  29-
30)

Issues 

(i)	

•	

Explanatory adequacy: 

Can the program above be carried out without stipulation?  Stalnaker’s 
explanation for and makes it seems so, but things are less clear for  other 
connectives (see discussion in Heim’s work; also Beaver 1993). 

Karttunen: 

30) 

If  the  local  context  for  “A  and  B”  is X,  then  the  local  context  for A  is X  and  the 
local context for B is X ∪ {A} 

31) 

Either John came, or Bill came too. 

Presupposition ‘projects’ 

32) 

Either John didn’t come, or Bill came too. 

Presupposition ‘doesn’t project’. 

33) 

•	

(ii) 

34) 

If  the  local  context  for  “A  or  B”  is  X,  then  the  local  context  for  A  is  X  and  the 
local context for B  is X ∪ {~ A} 

What’s  the  connection  between  the  inheritance  facts  in  sentences  involving 
connectives and the truth-conditional content of those connectives? 

Going below the level of the clause:


Every nation cherishes its king.


Next up:  Heim’s proposal, which addresses both concerns above.
