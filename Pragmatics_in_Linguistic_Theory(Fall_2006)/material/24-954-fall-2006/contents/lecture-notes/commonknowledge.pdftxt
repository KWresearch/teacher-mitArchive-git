Implicatures and common knowledge 

1.	

Background: informativeness with respect to shared assumptions

1)

Common  ground  (roughly!):  set  of  propositions whose  truth  is  taken  for  granted 
as part of the background of the conversation. 

Context set: set of worlds in which all  the propositions in  the common ground are 
true (represents the shared beliefs of the participants in the conversation.) 

Adding  a  proposition  p  to  a  common  ground  c  amounts  to  kicking  out  of  the 
context set the worlds where p is false. 

p + cg = p ∩ cs 

Informativeness: 

A proposition p is more informative than a proposition q given a context set c iff 
(p ∩ c) ⊂  (q ∩ c) 

A proposition p is as informative as a proposition q given a contex set c iff 
(p ∩ c) = (q ∩ c) 

Cases where p logically entails q, but p is not more informative than q given a 
context set c. For instance:

Shared assumption:  When John bakes pies, he always bakes 4. 

(a)	

(b) 

Yesterday, John baked some cakes.


Yesterday, John baked 4 cakes.


[[(b)]]  ⊂ [[(a)]], but it is not the case that  ([[(b)]] ∩ c) ⊂  ([[(a)]]  ∩ c)

Gricean reasoning and informativeness 

From  a  Gricean  perspective,  we  would  expect  the  computation  of  quantity 
implicatures  to  be  sensitive  to  contextual  information  (Heim  1991,  Fox,  Percus 
2006) 

Suppose that 

The speaker said p. 

There  is a proposition q which  (i)  is a  scalar  alternative of  q  (ii)  is  relevant  to  the 
topic  of  the  conversation  (iii)  asymmetrically  entails  p  and  (iv)  is  not  more 
informative than p given the context set. 

Then: 

If the hearer reasons based on the Maxim of Quantity, she shouldn’t conclude that 
the  speaker  is  convinced  that  not  q.  Given  the  set  of  assumptions  that  hearer  and 
speaker share uttering q wouldn’t have been more informative than uttering p. 

Magri  2006:  we  find  cases  where  1  and  2  obtain,  and  where  we  nevertheless 
derive the implicature that q is false. 

[Given that p and q are equivalent with respect to our shared assumptions, p & ~ q 
(plain  meaning  +  implicature)  is  a  contradiction  with  respect  to  our  shared 
assumptions  (i.e.,  the  intersection  of  the  strong  meaning  of  the  assertion  with 
the context set is empty). 

As a result, we get oddness (Magri’s First Condition for Oddness: a sentence p 
sounds  odd  if  its  strengthened  assertion  is  a  contradiction  given  common 
knowledge). ] 

•	

These cases support the proposal that scalar  implicatures are not derived via 
Gricean reasoning.

A couple of examples 

Type 1:  common knowledge provided by previous discourse. 

3)	

John assigned the same grade to all his students… He gave the same 
grade to some of them.  (E. Chemla, p.c. to Schlenker) 

[same structure as Danny’s prime numbers example] 

John assigned the same grade to all his students. 
John gave the same grade to some of  his students. 
John gave the same grade to all of his students. 

Assume  that  before  uttering  r  we  have  no  beliefs  about  how  John’s  grades  are 
distributed. Then when we update c with r, we get: 

r = 
p = 
q = 

•	

Type 1 worlds: 
Type 2 worlds: 
Type 3 worlds: 
Type 4 worlds: 
Type 5 worlds: 

John assigned an A to all of his students. 
John assigned a B to all of his students. 
John assigned a C to all of his students. 
John assigned a D to all of his students. 
John assigned an F to all of his students. 

•	

•	

•	

Given  this  context  set,  p  and  q  are  equally  informative  (p ∩  c = q ∩  c  =  Type  1 
worlds). 

Hence,  no  implicature  is  expected  if  implicatures  are  derived  via  Gricean 
reasoning. 

But,  in  fact,  we  understand  the  last  sentence  in  (3)  to  convey  that  John  gave  the 
same grade to some but not all of his students (p & ~ q). 

[Hence,  the discourse  in  (3)  expresses a  contradiction with  respect  to our  context 
set.]

Type 2: “true common knowledge” 

A variation on Hawkins 1991 

4) 

5) 

•

(4)	

(5)	

? Some parents of the victim got married in the Spring of 1972. 

The parents of the victim got married in the Spring of 1972. 

Intuition:  (4)  suggests  that  the  victim  has more  than  two  parents.  This  conflicts  ` 
with common knowledge. 

Proposal: (building on Hawkins 1991): (4) implicates that (5)  is false.  Implicature 
+ assertion contradict common knowledge and, as a result, (4) is odd. 

(i)	

(5) asymmetrically entails (4). 

[[Some parents of the victim got married]] = 
λw. ∃x [parents-of-the-victim’ (x)(w) & got married’ (x)(w)] 

[[The parents of the victim got married]] = 
λw. got married’(σ*x parents-of-the-victim’ (x)(w))(w)) 

In all the worlds where the group of parents of the victim got married, there is an 
individual that satisfies the property [[parents of the victim]] and that got 
married. 

In a world where the victim had three parents and two of them got married, (4) is 
true and (5) is false. 

(ii)	

Given common knowledge, (4) and (5) are equally informative. 

In all of the worlds of our context set, the victim has two parents. In all of those 
worlds, (4) is true iff (5) is true. 

(iii)	

(iv)	

Given (ii) no implicature is expected on the Gricean view. 

Claim: However, (4) implicates that (5) is false. 

[Assumption: the and some are scale-mates.] 

Strong  meaning  of  (4):  There  are  some  parents  of  the  victim  that  got 
married  in  the  Spring  of  1972,  and  it  is  not  true  that  the  maximal 
individual  that satisfies the property [[parents of  the victim]] got married

[(iv)  Hence, the strengthened meaning of (4) is a contradiction with respect to 
our context set. This explains why (4) sounds odd.]

Hawkins 1991 cases 

6) 

? John has interviewed a father of the victim. 

•

7) 

8) 

• 

9) 

•	

(i)	

9)	

Intuition: (9) is odd because it suggests that the victim had more than one father. 

First shot: the indefinite article triggers an antiuniqueness presupposition. 

No: 

Robert caught a 20 ft. long catfish 

(Heim 1991) 

Every candidate should send a paper of his  (Sauerland 2003) 

Hawkins derives the effect as a scalar implicature: (9) implicates that (12) is false. 

John has interviewed the father of the victim. 

Implementing Hawkins’ proposal: 

Sentences containing presuppositional items are partial function from worlds into 
{0,1} (cf. Heim and Kratzer) 

[[John has interviewed the father of the victim]] 

λw: ∃!x (father-of-the-victim (x) (w).  interviewed’ (j)(ιx(father-of-the-victim 
(x)(w))(w) 

12)	

[[John has interviewed a father of the victim]] = 

λw. ∃x (father of the victim’(x)(w) & interviewed’ (j)(x)(w)) 

(ii)	

(iii)	

(iv)	

the presupposition of (9) asymmetrically entails the presupposition of (12). 

the assertion of (9) asymmetrically entails the assertion of (12) 

the assertion of (9) is as informative as the assertion of (12) given our shared 
assumptions (i.e., that people only have one father).

(v)	

(vi)	

Assumption: Hawkins 1991, a and the are scale mates. [Cf. Gazdar 1977: scalar 
alternatives must share selectional restrictions and item-induced presuppositions.] 

From here, we can derive antiuniqueness by (a) strengthening the presupposition 
and (b) strengthening the assertion. 

Strenghthening the presupposition: 

Ps(9) = {w: there is a unique father of the victim in w}

Ps (12) = W


Strengthening ps (9) = W - {w: there is a unique father of the victim in w} 

[[John  has  interviewed  a  father  of  the  victim]]  will  be  defined  only  in  worlds 
where  the  victim  doesn’t  have  a  unique  father  (a  contradiction  given  common 
knowledge). 

[Note:  an  additional  source of  oddness?  In  some of  the worlds  in  the domain,  the 
victim will have no father. ] 

Strengthening the assertion: 

Assertion of (9) =  {w: there is an x such that x is the father of the victim and John 
interviewed x} 

Assertion  of  (12)  =  {w:  the  victim  has  a  unique  father  y  in  w  and  John 
interviewed y in w} 

Assertion of  [[John has interviewed a father of the victim]] = {w:  there is an x 
such that x is the father of the victim and John interviewed x} - {w: the victim has 
a unique father y in w and John interviewed y in w} = 

{w:  there  is  not  a  unique  father  of  the  victim  in  w  and  there  is  a  father  of  the 
victim that John interviewed in w} [contradiction given common knowledge} 

•	

•	

We  have  already  seen  that  the Gricean  set  up  predicts  that  no  implicature  should 
be derived in cases like the above. 

What  about  strengthening  the  presupposition?  Percus  (2006),  Sauerland  (2006): 
strengthening  the  presupposition  is  incompatible  with  Gricean  reasoning.  But 
see Schlenker (2006).

The mystery of resistant implicatures. 

•	

•	

•	

•	

•	

•	

Magri’s  generalization:  a  sentence  sounds  odd  if  its  strengthened  meaning  (plain 
meaning + implicature) is a contradiction given common knowledge. 

This  seems  right.  Furthermore,  we  don’t  seem  to  be  able  to  recover  from  this 
effect. 

But  why  should  this  be?  In  principle,  we  might  expect  the  weak  meaning  to  be 
accessible.  Why  can’t  we  ‘reanalyze’  the  odd  examples  above?  [Cf.  cases  of 
implicature cancellation.] 

A  related,  but  different  puzzle:  mismatching  alternatives  arise  also  when  not 
relevant. 

Magri suggests that mismatching alternatives are not optional (see  section  1.5.2. 
for discussion, implementation and problems). 

Consequences for theories of NP licensing: 

In order  to account for  the distribution of NPIs, Krifka (1995) proposes that NPIs 
are  ruled  out  in  contexts  where  the  implicatures  they  trigger  contradict  the 
assertion (see also Lahiri 1998). 

10)	 Mary saw anything. 

(a)	

(b)	

Implicates that Mary didn’t see anything. 

Asserts that Mary saw something. 

Common  criticism:  implicatures  that  contradict  the  assertion  should be  cancelled. 
As  Chierchia  puts  it:  “implicatures  that  clash  with  the  assertion  do  not  generally 
yield ungrammaticality; they are simply removed (exploiting clashes of this  sort  is, 
in fact, the way implicatures are typically cancelled).”  (Chierchia 2005: 22). 
In  light  of  the  facts  we  have  been  looking  at,  this  line  of  reasoning  sounds  much 
more plausible…
