Review of Groenendijk & Stokhof (1982) 

Question intension: relation between worlds 

[[which cats ate]] = 

λwλw’ [λx [cat(x)(w) & ate (x)(w)] = λx [cat (x)(w’) & ate (x)(w’)]] 

Question extension: proposition 

[[which cats ate]](w0) = 

λw [λx [cat(x)(w0) & ate (x)(w0)] = λx [cat (x)(w) & ate (x)(w)]] 

Some question embedding verbs combine with question extensions, e.g., know: 

John  knows  which  cats  ate  is  true  in  w0  iff  in  all  of  the  worlds  that  are 
compatible with what  John believes  in w0  the  set  of  cats  that  ate  is  the  set  of  cats 
that ate in w0. 

Some  question  embedding  verbs  combine  with  question  intensions,  e.g.,  agree 
[example not discussed in G & S 1982] 

Pat  and Mary agree on which  cats ate  is  true  in w0  iff  Pat’s and Mary’s belief 
worlds  in  w0  give  the  same  answer  to  the  embedded  question  (that  is,  the  set  of 
ats  that  ate  is  the  same  in  all  of  Pat  belief  worlds  as  in  all  of  Mary’s  belief 
worlds). 

Prediction:  when  the domain  is  fixed ?xPx  and ?x¬Px  (the positive  should  come 
out as  equivalent. 

Counterexamples:

Scenario: Mary, Peter, and John were at  the party. Sally wasn’t.  I expected Mary,

Peter, John and Sally to be at the party.

I was better at predicting who would show up  than I was at predicting who would 
show up (Beck & Rullmann 1999: 282) 

Beck & Rullman’s scenario: You predicted of 10 people that  they would show up 
and 8 of them  actually  did.  And  you  predicted  of  10  people  that  they  wouldn’t 
show up, and only 5 of them did.

The video shows which of those animals the man didn’t feed. 

(Kratzer 2005) 

Scenario  (not  in Kratzer’s handout): There  are  four  animals  in  the  animal  shelter: 
a  cat,  a dog,  a hamster  and  a parrot. The  cat  and  the dog were  fed by  a man. The 
hamster  and  the parrot were fed by  a woman,  in  a different room. We videotaped 
the man feeding the cat and the dog. 

Kratzer 2005  (Part 1) 

Claim: The problem posed by examples like (5) through (7) disappears if G & S’s 
theory is implemented within a semantics based on events/situations. 

[Kratzer also  discusses  another  apparent  problem  with  G  &  S’theory  – 
quantificational variability in questions. We won’t talk about this today.] 

2.1.	

Background: 

Kratzer’s situation semantics  (Kratzer 1989) 

•

Some crucial assumptions: 

Sentences denote propositions. 

Propositions are sets of possible situations. 

Possible situations are parts of possible worlds 

“possib le  situations  are  par ticulars.  Consider  this  sh irt.  It  is  str iped  in  a  very  particu lar  way.  This 
very particu lar way of being str iped  is an actual state of my  shirt.  It  is a state so par ticular that  it  is a 
state  that  only  my  sh irt  can  be  in .  Its  particu lar  way  of  being  striped  is  just  one  of  the  states  of  my 
shirt.  There  are  others.  Its  very  particular  way  of  being  cotton,  its  very  particular  way  of  being  as 
long  as  it  is , and  its very  particu lar way  of  being  from  Italy. All of  those states are  fairly  permanen t. 
But  there  are  also  more  fug itive  states  that  my  sh irt  might  be  in .  I ts  very  par ticular  spinn ing  in  the 
washing machine this morn ing. Its very particular drying on the line. Its very particular way of being 
folded  and  placed  in  the  drawer.  Particular  states  like  these,  whether  actual  or  merely  possible,  I 
suggest, are the k ind of situations that are in S”  (Kratzer 2002: 659-660)

Situations stand in part-whole relations to each other. 

For all s ∈ S there is a unique s’ ∈ S such that s ≤ s’  and for all s’’ ∈ S , if s’ ≤  s’’, 
then s’ =  s’’ 

(Every possible situation s is related to a unique maximal element, the world of s. 
Thus, no possible situation can be part of more than one world.) 

Counting situations: What are the truth-makers? 1 

•	

Counting  situations  is  hard  due  to  the  part-whole  structure  of  the  domain  of 
situations: 

8)	

John climbed Mt. Holyoke twice. 

“This  sentence should  obviously  not be  true  in  a world where John  only  climbed Mt. Holyoke once. 
But  clear ly,  even  if  John  climbed  Mt.  Ho lyoke  only  once,  there  will  be  many  situations  in  wh ich 
John  climbed  Mt.  Ho lyoke.  For  examp le,  there  is  the  situation  that  contains  John’s  climb ing  Mt. 
Holyoke  and  the  celebratory  dinner  he  had  afterwards.  To  correctly  coun t  Mt.  Holyoke-climbing 
situations,  we  have  to  get  r id  of  all  sorts  of  irrelevant  junk.  What  we  wan t  is  to  retrieve  the  truth-
makers  the  situations  that  make  the  proposition  that  John  climbed  Mt.  Holyoke  true.”  (von  F intel 
1997/2005: 2) 

•	

•	

Berman  1987,  Heim  1990:  we  need  to  count  minimal  situations  in  which  John 
climbed  Mt.  Holyoke  (situations  that  have  no  proper  parts  in  which  John  also 
climbed Mt. Holyoke). 

But:  there  are  propositions  that  do  not  seem  to  have  minimal  situations  (Kratzer, 
p.c.  to  von  Fintel):  atelic  propositions,  e.g.,  that  John  runs.  And  “even  if  we  are 
lucky  and  end  up  with  some  very  small  undividable  running  situations,  those  will 
not be what we are counting” (von Fintel 1997/2005: 5): 

9)	

Often, when John runs, he wears his old tennis shoes. 

Here, we seem to be counting situation “in which John starts to run, runs and stops” 
(von Fintel 1997/2005). 

10)	 Whenever Hans drinks beer, it’s always a whole liter (Schwarz) 

1  This discussion follows very closely  the d iscussion  in von F intel (1997/2005) and Angelika Kratzer’s 
2005 LSA slides.

A new tool: Situations that exemplify a proposition (Kratzer 1998, 1990, 2002): 

s  is a situation that exemplifies p  iff 
(i) p is true in s and 
(ii) any subsituation of s in which p is not true can be extended to a subsituation of s
that is a minimal situation in which p is true. 

Consider: 

12) 
13) 

There are teapots. 
It is raining. 

•	

•	

So what are we counting? 

Not:  Maximal situations that exemplify the proposition. 

Since  we  can  put  together  two  situations  to  form  a  bigger  situation,  in  a  given 
world  there  will  be  only  one  maximal  situation  that  exemplifies  any  given 
proposition. Thus, sentences like (14) below will never come out true. 

14)	

John ran twice. 

•	

Better:  Maximal  spatiotemporally  connected  situations  that  exemplify  the 
proposition. 

[this  is  still  too  simplistic  –  see  von  Fintel  1997/2005  for  discussion  and 
references. But we don’t need to worry about it here]

The  embedded  complement  of  show  is  transparent  (all  examples  below  from 
Kratzer 2005): 

The  video  shows which  animals  the man  fed. The man  is  the  director  of  the  zoo. 
Therefore the video shows which animals the director of the zoo fed. 

The  video  shows  which  animals  the  man  fed.  Those  animals  are  precisely  the 
animals  the  Gazette  wrote  about  yesterday.  Therefore  the  video  shows  which  of 
the animals the Gazette wrote about yesterday the man fed. 

The  video  shows  which  of  those  animals  the  man  fed.  What  the  man  fed  the 
animals  contained  poison.  Therefore  the  video  shows  which  of  the  animals  was 
poisoned. 

Comparison with direct perception reports

21)	

The  complement  of  show  behaves  exactly  like  the  complement  of  direct 
perception reports. 

Direct  perception  reports,  a  construction  illustrated  in  (19),  contrast  with  direct 
perception reports, such as (20) (examples from Kratzer 2006). 

Beryl saw Meryl feed the animals. 

Beryl saw that Meryl feed the animals. 

Direct  perception  reports are  epistemically neutral;  indirect  perception reports are 
not epistemically neutral (examples from Kratzer 2005). 

The  librarian  actually  saw Trudy  steal  the book,  but  she had no  idea  that  she was 
witnessing a theft.

#  The  librarian  actually  saw  that  Trudy  stole  the  book,  but  she  had  no  idea  that

The  embedded  complement  of  indirect  perception  reports  can  be  transparent  or 
opaque.  The  first  premise  in  (23)  has  a  reading  that  renders  the  argument  below 
invalid. (examples from Kratzer 2006).

_________________________________________________________________ 

Beryl saw that Meryl sprinkled the most deadly powder on Cheryl’s dinner. 

The  embedded  complement  of  direct  perception  reports  can  only  be  transparent, 
as illustrated by the validity of (24).

Where situations come in:

26)

27)	

Barwise  1981:  direct  perception  reports  like  (25)  should  be  analyzed  along  the 
lines of (26). 

Beryl saw Meryl feed the animals. . 

There  is  an  actual  past  situation  s  that  Beryl  saw  and  s  supports  the  truth  of 
the proposition that Meryl feed the animals. 
The  situation  semantics  of  Barwise  &  Perry  (1983)  is  very  different  from  the  one 
proposed by Kratzer. But the result carries over: 
There  is  an  actual  past  situation  s  that  Beryl  saw  and  s  exemplifies  the 
proposition that Meryl feed the animals.

Since the positive and the negative question extensions are not exemplified by  the 
same situations, (34) and (35) come out as having different truth-conditions. 

Tricky: what situations exemplify the negative embedded question?

Consider the following quote from Kratzer 2006: 

(51)  a.  There is no teapot. 
b. λs ¬∃x teapot (x)(s) 

“51(b)  is  exemp lif ied  by  the  situations  in  which  it  is  true.  This  makes  the  situations  exemp lify ing 
negative  sentences  a  rather  d isparate  batch  that  do  not  resemble  each  other  in  any  in tuitive  sense. 
Negative  propositions  like  51(b)  are  unfit  for  stating  generalizations ,  or  saying  anything  contentful 
for  that  matter,  un less  they  are  used  to  make  claims  about  particu lar  situations.  If  we  want  to 
quantify  over  situations exemplifying  the propositions  expressed  by  negative sen tences , as we do  in 
(52) below (…), contextual restrictions for the topic situation must play a major role, includ ing  those 
contributed  by  the  topic-focus  articu lation  and  presuppositions  (Kratzer  1989,  von  Fintel  1994, 
2004a). (….) 

(52)  Whenever nobody showed up, we canceled  the class. 

(Kratzer 2006: 27-28)

What can we say about:

(b)	

It surprised me who was at the party 

It surprised me who was not at the party. 

37)	

I was better at predicting who would show up  than I was at predicting who would 
not show up. 

More  of my  positive  predictions were matched with  actual  truth-makers  than my 
negative predictions were.
