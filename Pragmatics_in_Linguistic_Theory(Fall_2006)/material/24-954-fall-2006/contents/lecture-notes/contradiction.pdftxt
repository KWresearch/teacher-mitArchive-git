Implicatures and contradictions : wrapping up (inconclusively) 

•	

•	

•	

Giorgio’s  examples:  Cases where  an  assertion  p  triggers  a  scalar  implicature  ~  q 
despite  the  fact  that  p  and  q  are  equally  informative  given  common  knowledge. 
This is unexpected if scalar implicatures are derived via Gricean reasoning. 

Suppose that you are a neo-Gricean: could you fight back? How? 

Emmanuel’s idea: 

Let's say that you hear some in a context where it is equivalent to all. 

You recognize a scalar item. 
i)	
You recognize that it was in an upward monotonic context. 
ii)	
iii)	 You then go and inspect alternatives obtained replacing some with a stronger term 
on the scale. 
all is such a term so you inspect the alternative with all instead of some. 
iv)	
v)	
The alternative seems absolutely equivalent so you don't derive any implicature. 
vi)	 BUT you wonder why the speaker didn't use this alternative because it would 
have saved you a lot of time, you could have stopped at step 3). 

So in the end, you don't derive an implicature but... you feel that the sentence 
is somewhat odd (i.e. could have been better)!

What do you think? 

If  we  accept  that  Giorgio’s  cases  involve  an  implicature,  the  following  question 
arises: (from last class) 

Why can’t we cancel implicatures that contradict common knowledge? 

Let’s us assume  a version of  the  syntactic  account  according  to which  a  sentence 
A that contains a scalar item has two alternative representations, as in 1). 

1)	

(a) 
(b)	

Exh (A) 
A 

Let’s  say  (a)  is  the  default  structure.  But  presumably,  the  structure  in  (b)  would 
still  be  available  to us.  In  cases where  the  structure  in  (a)  denotes a  contradiction 
wrt common knowledge, why can’t we access (b)? Why can’t we recover?

2) 

Two moves you guys suggested: 

Let’s revise our theory: 

Exh  is always obligatory. 

(Danny) 

Let’s reconsider the data:  We ARE able to recover. 

(Alan) 

The exhaustive operator is obligatory. 

Exh(A): A is true and all the alternatives to A that are not entailed by A are either 
false or irrelevant. 

[the d ifferences between th is def. and  the one in Giorg io’s paper are irrelevant at the moment.] 

3) 

The relevance relation satisfies these two axioms 

(a)	

If p and q are equivalent with respect to c. k., then R (p) = R (q). 
(relevance is closed under equivalence wrt common knowledge) 

(b)	

For any p, R (p) = 1. 

Example 1:


4) 

A:  Who is usually available after dinner?

John is usually available after dinner. 
B:	

B  is  not  taken  to  convey  that  John  is  not  always  available  after  dinner  because 
John is always available after dinner is not relevant (standard explanation). 

Example 2: 

5) 

6)	

? Some parents of the victim got married in 1972 

The parents of the victim got married in 1972. 

Given  3),  when  5)  is  asserted,  both  5)  and  6)  are  relevant.  Given  2),  5) 
conveys that 6) is false.

(Clash between the intuitive notion of relevance – essentially tied to what the 
of the conversation is – that we need to account for 4) and the axioms in 3)?]

Cancellation is possible. 

John  assigned  the  same  grade  to  all  of  his  students.  #He  gave  an  A  to  some  of 
them. 

John  assigned  the  same  grade  to  all  of  his  students.  He  gave  an  A  to  some  of 
them. Thus, he must have given an A to all of them. 
(Alan) 

We noted  that (i) we need  an explicit continuation  that  triggers reanalysis and  (ii) 
this strategy does not seem to be available always: 

9)	

? Fred lost a nose in the war. 

•	

•	

Suppose that we maintain that Exh is not obligatory and we accept that, at least in 
some  cases,  the  offending  implicature  just  can’t  be  cancelled.  Is  this  an 
insurmountable problem for Giorgio’s proposal? 

Not necessarily. Analogy with garden-path cases: 

10)	

The horse raced past the barn fell. 

[reanalysis very very hard. Cf. with 11)] 

11)	

The girl knew the answer to the question was hard. 

•	

We would need  to  explain why reanalysis  is very hard  (impossible?)  in Giorgio’s 
cases.

Can  we  find  other  constructions  that  meet  the  following  conditions: 
(i)  are 
structurally  ambiguous  (ii)  one  structure  is  preferred  over  the  other  (iii) 
the 
preferred  structure  denotes  a  contradiction  given  common  knowlege  (iv)  the 
construction is odd beyond recovery? 

Not sure – a case to look at; 

12)	

John showed a picture to every photographer 

(forward scope (a> every) preferred – see experiments by Tunstall,  Kurtzman & 
MacDonald, Bader). 

Cases where the forward scope denotes a contradiction wrt common knowledge? 
Examples?
