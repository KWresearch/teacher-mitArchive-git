The neo-Gricean account of scalar implicatures: 

If  a  speaker  utters a  statement S  that  contains a  scalar  item,  then,  for  all S’  that (i) 
belong to the set of scalar alternatives of S and (ii) are relevant to the topic of 
conversation and (iii)  are more informative than S, the hearer can conclude that 
the speaker does not have evidence that S’ is true. 

Given the assumption that the speaker is opinionated with respect to the truth value 
of  the  scalar  alternatives  of  S,  the  hearer  can  conclude  further  that  the  speaker 
believes  that  all  the  scalar  alternatives  S’  that  are  both  relevant  to  the  topic  of 
conversation and more informative than S are false. 

Sauerland  (2004)  makes  explicit  a  procedure  for  deriving  scalar  implicatures  for

proposing that the hearer assumes that the speaker is opinionated only in 
cases where that assumption does not lead to the conclusion that the 
speaker has contradictory beliefs.

Computing scalar implicatures: first shot 

• 

Getting scalar alternatives. 

3)  A  sentence  ψ  is  a  one-step  scalar  alternative  of  φ  if  the  following  two  conditions 
hold: 

a. 
b. 

φ is not equal to ψ 
there  are  scalar  expressions  α  and  α’  which  both  occur  on  the  same  scale  C 
such that ψ  is the result of replacing one occurrence of α in φ with α’. 

4)  A sentence ψ is a scalar alternative of φ  if  there is a sequence (φ0  ,  .  . . , φn  ) with n 
≥ 0 and φ0  = φ and φn  = ψ such  that,  for all  i with 1 ≤ i ≤ n, φ  i  is a one-step  scalar 
alternative of φi −1 . 

5) 

Prediction: Crossing scales. 

Let X  be  an  element  of  quantitative  scale QX  and Y  an  element  of  the  quantitative 
scale QY. Let ψ  (X, Y)  be  a  sentence  that  contains both X  and Y. The  set  of  scalar 
alternatives of ψ (X, Y) will be 

6) 

{ φ (X’, Y’)  = X’ is an element of QX andY’ is an element of QY} 

• 

7) 

Computing scalar implicatures


¬ψ’  is an scalar implicature of ψ if the following three hold:


a. ψ’  is a scalar alternative of ψ 
b. ψ’  entails ψ 
c. ψ’ does not entail ψ 

[Note: (i) no reference to relevance; (ii) no reference to epistemic state of speaker]

Examples


It is not the case that Paul ate all of the eggs.


scalar item 

Scale = {some, all}

Scalar alternatives = {It is not the case that Paul ate some of the eggs}

Implicature = Paul ate some of the eggs.

The speaker doesn’t know whether Mary went to UMass.


The speaker doesn’t know whether Mary went to UConn.

Problem 2: scalar items in the scope of disjunction1. 

12)  Mary read War and Peace, or Love in the Times of Cholera, or Hopscotch. 

W ∨ (L ∨ H)


We  want:  Mary read exactly one of the three books. That is,


~ (W & L) & ~ (W & H) & ~  (L & H)


1  The  puzzle  posed  by  a  disjunction  in  the  scope  of  disjunction  was  hin ted  at  by  McCawley  (1993)  in  an 
exercise  (p.  324)  and  later  discussed  by  Lee  (1995,  1996)  and  Simons  (1998).  The  problem  in  its  full 
generality was d iscussed by Schwarz (2000) and Chierch ia (2002).

Part 2: The epistemic status of implicatures 

•	

•	

•	

The  implicatures  generated  by  Gricean  reasoning  are  of  the  form  “the  speaker 
is not convinced that p”. 

In order  to get  implicatures of  the  form “the  speaker  is convinced  that  not  p” we 
need  to  assume  that  the  speaker  is  opinionated  with  respect  to  the  truth-value  of 
the alternatives. 

But  sometimes  that  assumption would  lead  to  the conclusion  that  the  speaker  had 
contradictory beliefs. 

22)	

A or B 

The speaker doesn’t believe that A

The speaker doesn’t believe that B.




The speaker doesn’t believe that A or B. 

•	

•	

Proposal:  Hearer  assumes  that  the  speaker  is  opinionated  only  in  cases  where 
this  assumption  doesn’t  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  speaker  has  contradictory 
beliefs. 

Implicatures are generated in two steps: 

First step: Primary (Gricean) implicatures (“the speaker is not convinced that”) 

Second  step:  Secondary  implicatures  (“the  speaker  is  convinced  that  not”).  This  step  is 
only licensed if it doesn’t give rise to a contradiction: 

23)	

If  ~ K  ψ  is  a  primary  implicature  of  φ  and  K  ~  ψ  is  consistent  with  the 
conjunction  of  φ  and  all  primary  implicatures  of  φ,  then  K~ψ  is  a  secondary 
implicature of φ.

But… embedded implicatures 

Evidence  for  locally  computed  implicatures  (examples  galore  in  last  class’s 
handout). 

31) 

If  John  owns  three  cars,  the  fourth  outside  the  house  must  belong  to  someone 
else. 

32)  You should buy the car with four doors rather than the one with two; it’s  more 
useful and the price is good. 

33) 

A teacher who is sometimes late is preferable to one who is always late. 

(Levinson 2000) 

•	

•	

“There are a number of constructions, dubbed intrusive constructions, where the 
truth-conditions of the whole expression depend on the implicatures of some of its 
constituent parts” 
(Levinson 2000: 214) 

Sauerland’s neogricean approach can give us implicatures embedded under 
disjunction, but it is unclear  how it would deal with examples like the above.

The exhaustivity operator approach (Fox) 

Fox 2004, 2006:  the source of scalar  implicatures is a silent operator akin to only, 
(exh)  which is syntactically projected (see also Chierchia,  Groenendijk 
and 
Stokhof  1984, Krifka 1995, Landman 1998, van Rooy 2002). 

Very roughly: 

34)	

John did [some]F  of the homework. 

Exh [John did [some]F  of the homework. 

John only did [some]F of the homework. 

•	

•	

Allowing  this  operator  to  project  at  embedded  sites  will  give  us  embedded 
implicatures. 

Background: a Rooth-style semantics for overt only. 

35)  Mary only introduced [Bill]F  to Sue. 

(Rooth 1985) 

Intuitively: 

(i) Mary introduced Bill to Sue 
(ii) Mary didn’t introduce anybody else to Sue. 

•	

First shot: 

36)	

[[only]] = 

λC<st,t> λpλw (p(w) & ∀q ((C(q) & q(w)) → p =  q)) 

[i.e,  only  is  a  function  that  takes  a  proposition  p  (in  our  example,  the  proposition  that  Mary 
introduced  Bill  to  Sue),  and  a  set  of  propositional  alternatives  C  (here,  the  set  of  propositions  of 
the form ‘ that Mary  in troduced x  to Sue’), and y ields the proposition  that  is  true  in  a world w  iff p 
is true in w 2  and no o ther proposition  in C is true in w. ] 

•	

How do we get the relevant alternatives?  (Rooth 1985, 1992) 

Let  us  assume  that  the  structure  of  35)  is  37)  below,  where  C  is  an  implicit 
argument of type <<s,t>,t> (see von Fintel 1997). 

2  The  question  of  whether  p  is  part  of  the  tru th-conditions,  or  merely  presupposed  (or  imp licated)  is  the 
subject of much debate. See, e.g., Horn (1992, 1996), and Atlas (1993).

37)  3 
onlyC  Mary only introduced [Bill]F  to Sue 

Following Rooth (1992), we can take C to be a contextually relevant subset of the 
focus value of  the  sister  of  only  containing  at  least  the denotation of  the  sister  of 
only and one other element. 

Informally,  we  get  the  focus  value  of  a  sentence  by  making  substitutions  in  the 
position corresponding  to  the focused phrase. For  instance,  in  the example above, 
the focus value of Mary introduced [BillF] to Sue is the set of propositions of the 
form ‘Mary introduced x to Sue’. 

•	

A concern: 3 

38)	 Mary only introduced [Bill and John]F  to Sue. 

According to 36), 38) will be true in a world w iff 

(i) Mary introduced Bill and John to Sue in w and 
(ii) all the relevant alternatives are false in w. 

But  if  it is true that Mary  introduced Bill and John  to Sue some of  the alternatives 
must be true as well, namely the ones that are logically entailed by the proposition 
that Mary  introduced Bill  and  John  to Sue  (i.e.,  that Mary  introduced Bill  to Sue, 
that Mary introduced John to Sue.) 

•	

Second shot (see von Fintel 1997 for discussion): 

39)	

[[only]] = 

λC<st,t> λpλw (p(w) & ∀q (C(q) & q(w)) → (p ⇒  q)) 
p ⇒ q = def  ∀w (p(w) → q(w)) 

[i.e., only  is a function that takes a set of propositions C and a proposition p and  yields 
the 
proposition  that is true in a wor ld w  iff p  is true in w and no proposition  in C is true in w  unless  it 
is  logically en tailed by p 4.] 

•	

This is the denotation that Fox adopts for his silent only, exh 

40)	

[[exh]] = 

λC<st,t> λpλw (p(w) & ∀q (C(q) & q(w)) → (p ⇒  q)) 
p ⇒ q = def  ∀w (p(w) → q(w)) 

3  See Rooth 1992, foo tnote 2.

4  An alternative would be to assume that the propositions en tailed by p do no t constitute leg itimate

alternatives to p (see von F intel 1997).

The proposal 

41) 

(a) 

John did [some]F  of the homework. 
(b)  Exh (John did [some]F  of the homework) 

(d) 

John did some of the homework and John didn’t do all of  the homework. 

• 

Note parallel with questions/answer pairs (G & S 1984) 

42)  A: Who came to the party? 
B:  James and Pete 

Exhaustivity inference: “and nobody else came” 

“A  weakly  exhaustive  answer  provides  a  complete  list,  a  strongly  exhaustive 
answer contains in addition the closure condition stating ‘and that’s all, folks.’  (G 
& S 1997: 1110) 

Several alternatives (from Fox 2004, see more discussion on Fox 2006) 

New ambiguity hypothesis 

All sentences are systematically ambiguous: 

(a)	
(b)	

Exh (John did some of the homework) 
John did some of the homework 

When  a  sentence  is  ambiguous,  the  default  interpretation  is  the  strongest 
alternative (“Chierchia’s pragmatic principle”) 

Assertions  are  always understood  as answers  to questions,  and  they  always  come 
with  an  exhaustive operator.  Implicature  cancellation  is  the  result  of  addressing  a 
different question (Irene, p.c. to Danny) 

A: 

A’:	

B:	

How many chairs  do you have? 

I need four chairs 

I have four chairs. 

•	

(i)	

(ii)	

43)	

(iii)	

Exh  is completely optional. But  if absent, we will get conclude that  the speaker  is 
ignorant  about  the  stronger  alternatives  (by  regular  Gricean  reasoning).  In  many 
cases this will be implausible, hence, exh is preferred (see Fox 2006).

•	

Fox  presents  a  battery  of  arguments  for  his  proposal  that  we  will  not  go  into 
today. But note that we can already see a clear advantage over the  neo-Gricean 
system: it allows us to compute implicatures in embedded positions. 

44)	

If [Exh  (John  owns  three  cars)],  the  fourth  outside  the  house  must  belong  to 
someone else. 

•	

•	

Do we still need the Gricean system? 

Yes.  The  exhaustivity  operator  does  not  deliver  ignorance  inferences.  (In  fact, 
what it gives us is stronger than Sauerland’s secondary implicatures.) 

Sauerland,  “On  embedded  implicatures”:  Differences  between  embedded  and 
global (only primary?) implicatures.


Claim: embedded  implicatures  are  optional;  primary  implicatures  cannot  be

cancelled.

Anyone who saw Elvis or Bobby Fisher must be blind. But those who saw both of 
them must have good eyes. 

46) 

# John saw Fisher or Elvis. He definitely saw Fisher 

(cf. with # The cat is on the mat, but I don’t believe it) 

47)

# They played many of Beethoven’s symphonies, and definitely all. 

They played many of Beeethoven’s symphonies and possibly all. 

What about..? 

49) 

John saw Fisher or Elvis. In fact, he saw Fisher. 

In fact seems to be used to express corrections:

B:
