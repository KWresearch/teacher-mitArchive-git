Questions 1 

Questions and pragmatics 

Why look at questions in a pragmatics class? 

“…where  there  are  questions,  there  are,  fortunately,  also  answers.  And  a 
satisfactory  theory  of  interrogatives  will  have  to  deal  with  those  as  well”. 
(Groenendijk and Stokhof 1984: 25) 

But questions may be successfully answered in several different ways. 

Who did John kiss at the party last night? 

A1:  Mary 
A2: 
The girl from next door. 
A3:  A redhead. 

(information-independent, complete answer) 
(information dependent, complete answer) 
(partial answer)j 

(Groenendijk and Stokhof 1984: 27) 

A:  Who came to the party? 
James and Pete 
B: 

(… and nobody else) 

A:  Where can one buy Italian newspapers? 
B:	
At Harvard Square. 

G  &  S’s  take  on  this:  what  constitutes  a  good  answer  to  a  question  cannot  be 
determined by the semantics of the question alone. ¨Within the semantic limits set 
by  the  denotation  of  a  question,  what  counts  as  a  good  answer  is  determined  by 
pragmatic factors”  (G & S 1982: 155) 

1  This  presentation  owes  a  lot  to  Pau l  Hagstrom’s  overv iew  article  on  questions  (Hagstrom  2003),  and  to 
Angelika Kratzer’s lecture notes for her Fall 2004 seminar. Of course, all errors are my own .

The agenda for today 

Two questions about questions: 

(i)	

(ii)	

What  do  questions  mean?  That  is,  what  do  we  know  when  we  know  the 
meaning of a question? 

How do we compute the meaning of questions from the meaning of their 
parts? (Compositionality) 

Today,  we  will  (mostly)  focus  on  (i):  We  will  discuss  and  evaluate  several 
proposals for question-denotations. 

Hamblin 1958 2 

The challenge:  how to handle questions in a truth-conditional semantics. 

•	

•	

•	

•	

Truth-conditional semantics is designed to handle statements. 

To  know  the  meaning  of  a  statement  is  to  know  the  conditions  under  which 
it is true (its truth-conditions). 

If  we  know  the  meaning  of  a  statement,  we  will  be  able  to  determine  whether 
it  is  true  given  a  particular  state  of  affairs.  This  intuition  can  be  captured  by 
taking  statements 
to  denote  propositions,  constructed  as 
(characteristic 
functions) of sets of possible worlds. 

But questions are not true or false! 

How  can  a  theory  that  pairs  sentences  with  their  truth-conditions  handle 
questions?

Hamblin to the rescue 

•	

•	

Hamblin  (1958)  takes  up  the  challenge  by  investigating  the  relation  between 
questions and statements. 

Three postulates: 

Postulate I:	

An answer to a question is a statement. 

Postulate II:	

Knowing what counts as an answer is equivalent to knowing the 
question. 

Postulate III:	

The possible answers to a question are an exhaustive set of mutually 
exclusive possibilities. 

• 

4) 

5) 

•	

•	

Postulate I: ‘fragment’ answers stand for whole statements. 

A: Who arrived? 
B:  James. 

B has expressed the proposition that James arrived. 

A: Did James arrive? 
B:  Yes.


B has expressed the proposition that James arrived.


Postulate  II:  to  know  the  meaning  of  a  question  is  to  know  its  answerhood 
conditions.  A  question  picks  out  a  set  of  propositions,  those  that  count  as  an 
answer. 

Postulate III: the possible answers are an exhaustive set (their union equals the set 
of  all  possible  worlds),  and  are mutually  exclusive  (in  any  given  world  only  one 
of  the  propositions  in  the  set  is  true).  That  is,  the  set  of  possible  answers  is  a 
partition of the set of possible worlds. 

6)	

Did James arrive?

Intro to Pragmatics (Fox/Menéndez-Benito) 

10/12/06 

Possible answers =  {Yes (that James arrived), No (that James didn’t arrive)} 

Type 1 worlds 

Type 2 worlds 

Yes 
(he 
did) 

No (he 
didn’t) 

7)	

Who arrived? 

Suppose that Marta, Pedro and Juan are all the people there are. 

Possible  answers  =  {that  only  Pedro  arrived,  that  only  Marta  arrived,  that  only  Juan 
arrived,  that  only  Marta  and  Pedro  arrived,  that  only  Juan  and  Marta  arrived,  that  only 
Juan and  Pedro arrived, that Marta, Pedro and Juan arrived, that nobody arrived} 

•	

3.	

•	

So: To ask a question is to present a way of partitioning the set of possible worlds, 
and to request information about which cell in the partition the actual world is in. 

Hamblin 1973 

Hamblin 1973 proposes a slightly different view: a question still picks out a set of 
propositions  (its  possible  answers),  but  those  propositions  are  not  mutually 
exclusive. 

8) 

[[Who ate?]]w0  =


λp∃x[human(x)(w0) & p = λw ate(x)(w)]


Suppose  that  the  only  people  there  are  in  the  actual  world  are  James,  Pete  and  Sally. 
Then:

[[Who ate?]]w0  =  {λw ate(James)(w), λw ate(Pete)(w), λw ate(Sally)(w)} = 

{that James ate, that Pete ate, that Sally ate} 3 

•	

Goal: give a compositional semantics for questions. 

In a nutshell: 

Interrogative pronouns denote sets of individuals. 

[[who]]w0  = {x: x is a person in w0} = {Juan, Pedro, Marta…} 

In  order  to  combine,  e.g.,  [[arrived]]w0  with  [[who]]w0,  we  apply  the  function 
denoted by arrived to each of the individuals in [[who]]w0. So: 

[[Who arrived?]] w0  = {λw arrived (Juan)(w), λw arrived (Pedro)(w), λw arrived 
(Marta)(w)…} = {that Juan arrived, that Pedro arrived, that Marta arrived…}

Karttunen 1977 

Karttunen builds on Hamblin 1973 by considering embedded questions:


John knows which of my pets ate.


John asked whether it is raining.


•	

The advantage of this move: 

The  denotation  for  embedded  questions  must  enter  into  the  compositional 
calculation of truth-conditions for sentences that embed them. 

And,  as  Groenendijk  and  Stokhof  (1982)  note,  while  we  lack  intuitions  about 
what  kind  of  semantic  object  is  to  be  associated  with  direct  questions,  “we  do 
have  some  intuitions  about  the  semantics  of  declarative  sentences  in  which  they 
occur embedded under such verbs as know, tell, wonder.” (G &S 1982: 175). 

So:  “What  kind  of  semantic  object  we  may  choose  to  associate  with  wh-
complements  is  restrained  by  various  facts  about  the  semantics  of  these 
sentences” (G &  S 1982: 175).

• 

Karttunen’s proposal: embedded questions denote the set of their true answers. 

12) 

[[which pets ate]]w0  = λp[p(w0) & ∃x[pet(x)(w0) & p = λw ate(x)(w)]] 

Suppose that the actual pets are Yoli, Piti, and Moti, and the pets who actually ate 
are Piti and Moti.  Then, 

13)	

[[which pets ate]]w0  = {λw ate(Piti)(w), λw ate(Moti)(w)} = 
{that Piti ate, that Moti ate} 

14)	

[[whether it is raining]] w0  = 

{that it is raining}, if it is raining in w0

{that it is not raining}, otherwise.


•	

Motivation:  intuition  that  Mary  knows  which  pets  ate  implies  only  that  I  know 
the true answers to the question which pets ate? 

15)	 Mary knows which of my pets ate. 

15) is true in w iff, in w, Mary believes every proposition in [[which of my pets 
ate]]w 

[Note  1:  A  substan tial  part  of  Karttunen’s  paper  is  devoted  to  der ive  these  question-denotations 
compositionally. We will not talk about this today. 

Note 2: What about d irect questions? While Karttunen  focuses on  embedded  questions , at  the beg inning  of 
the  paper  he  mentions  prev ious  proposals  that  treat  matrix  questions  as  semantically  equivalent  to  a 
declarative  sen tence  con taining  the  corresponding  indirect  question  embedded  under  a  performative  verb 
(see Aqvist, Hinttikka, Lewis and Cresswell): 

(i)	

(ii)	

(a) 
(b)	

(a) 
(b)	

Is it raining? 
Which book d id Mary read? 

I ask you ( to tell me) whether it is raining. 
I ask you  (to  tell me) wh ick book Mary read. 

Karttunen  thinks  these  analyses  are  on  the  right  track.  Thus,  he  rejects  Hamblin’s  analysis  of  matrix 
questions as sets of propositions.]

Problems for Karttunen 

5.1.1.	 Intrusion of false beliefs 

•	

Suppose  that Yoli,  Piti  and Moti  are my pets,  and  that Yoli  and Piti  ate,  but Moti 
didn’t. 

16)	

[[which of my pets ate]]w0  = {that Yoli ate, that Piti ate} 

Assume further that Laura correctly believes that Yoli and Piti ate, but mistakenly 
believes that Moti ate too. 

•	

17) 

Yoli ate, Piti ate, 
Moti ate. 

w0 

•	

Is the sentence in 18) true  in the scenario above? 

18)	

Laura knows which of my pets ate. 

PREDICTION: 

18) is true 

(Laura believes all the propositions in [[which of my pets ate]]w0) 

INTUITION: 

18) is false

Strong vs. weak exhaustiveness: 

•	

G & S: We can distinguish different degrees of exhaustiveness of  complements” 
Karttunen’s  question  denotations  are  exhaustive  “to  the  lowest  degree”.  To 
account  for  the  meaning  of  embedded  questions,  we  need  a  stronger  notion  of 
exhaustiveness. 

“A  weakly  exhaustive  answer  provides  a  complete  list,  a  strongly  exhaustive 
answer contains in addition the closure condition stating ‘and that’s all, folks.’  (G 
& S 1997: 1110) 

5.1.2.	 De dicto and de re readings 

•	

G & S: 19) has two readings. 

19)	

Danny knows which spies came to the party. 

•	

•	

Consider the following scenario (inspired by Hagstrom 2003). 

There are several spies infiltrated in the MIT Linguistics department. Their names 
are Zoch, Vloch and Poch. Danny hosted  a departmental party  last night, and  two 
of  the  spies,  Zoch  and  Vloch,  attended.  Danny  knows  exactly  who  came  to  the 
party, but has no idea that Zoch and Vloch are spies. 

Is 19) true in the scenario above? Yes and no… 

Yes:	

de re reading 

Suppose  that  Agent  Jones,  from  the  FBI,  knows  who  the  spies  are  and  wants  to 
find out whether  they came to  the party. He still might ask Danny because Danny 
knows which spies came to the party, despite not knowing who the spies are. 

No:	

de dicto 

The other (more natural) reading of 19) is the de dicto reading. There is a sense in 
which  Danny  doesn’t  know  which  spies  came  to  the  party:  If  you  asked  him 
directly  Which  spies  came  to  the  party?  he  wouldn’t  be  able  to  tell  you.  On  this 
reading,  part  of  what  someone  when  he  knows  which  spies  came  to  the  party  is 
which individuals (at least among the attendees) are spies.

Karttunen only predicts the de re reading. 

On Karttunen’s  analysis,  the  only  thing  necessary  for  19)  to  be  true  in  the  actual 
world  is  that Danny  believes  the  propositions  in  {Zoch  came  to  the  party,  Vloch 
came  to  the  party}.  The  information  that  these  individuals  are  spies  in  the  actual 
world is not encoded in those propositions. 

5.2.	 G & S’s proposal 

20) 

[[which pets ate]]w0  =


λw[λx[pet(x)(w0) & ate(x)(w0)] =λx[pet(x)(w) & ate(x)(w) ] ]


=	

the proposition that is true in a world w iff the set of pets that ate in w is 
the same as the set of actual pets that ate in the actual world. 

[Note:  the extension of  an embedded question  is now a proposition. This gives G & S  an 
advantage  in  accounting  for  coordination  cases  like  John  knows  that  Peter  has  left  and 
whether Mary has gone with him] 

21)	 Mary knows which of my pets ate. 

is true in the actual world iff, in the actual world, Mary believes that the set of 
pets that ate is the set of pets that actually ate. 

•	

Note that this can be considered a return to Hamblin 1958 (see Hagstrom 2003) 

For  Hamblin  1958,  the  set  of  answers  to  which  of  my  pets  ate?  would  be  the 
partition {that  only Yoli  ate,  that  only  Piti  ate,  that  only  Moti  ate,  that  only Yoli 
and Piti ate, that only Yoli and Moti ate, that only Piti and Moti ate, that Yoli, Piti 
and Moti ate} 

For G & S 1982, knowing which of my pets ate amounts to knowing which cell in 
this  partition  the  actual  world  belongs  to.  (G  &  S  1984  view  questions  as 
partitions  on  the  set  of  worlds,  “a  perspective  which  is  different  from,  though 
equivalent with  the  propositional  concepts view  taken  in G & S  (1982)”  (G & S 
1984: 214).

Back to the problems 

•	

•	

Protection against false beliefs 



G & S’s question denotation guarantees that 21)  comes out false  if Mary believes 
a false answer to the embedded question even if she also believes true ones. 

De dicto and de re readings. 



The  de  dicto  reading  is  accounted  for  in  a  direct  manner.  Knowing  which  spies 
attended  the  party  amounts  to  knowing  the  extension  of  the  set  of  spies  who 
called  in  the  actual  world.  This  includes  information  about  the  spy-status  of  the 
attendees. 

G & S  take  the de  dicto  reading  to be  the basic one,  and derive  the de  re  reading 
by quantifying-in.  I won’t go  into the quantifying-in mechanism here, because we 
are not discussing the compositional derivation of these readings. What we get is: 

22)	

[[which pets ate]]w0  = λw∀x[pet(x)(w0) → [ate(x)(w0) ↔ate(x)(w) ] ] 

5.3.	

Too strong? 

•	

23)	

Are the arguments below valid? 

I know who ate 
John didn’t eat 
_________________ 

I know that John didn’t eat

This type of argument is only predicted to be valid if I know who the people are. 

“There  seems  to be  only one  type  of  situation  in  which knowing who walks may 
not  turn  out  to  be  the  same  as  knowing  who  doesn’t  (…).  This  is  the  type  of 
situation  in which  the subject of  the propositional attitude is not fully  informed as 
to which  set  of  individuals  constitutes  the domain  of  the discourse  (…).”  (G & S 
1982) 

“Strong Exhaustiveness, thus, should not be confused with the requirement that an 
answer specify both  the positive and  the negative extension of a relation.” (G & S 
1997) 

“…  the  equivalence  of  interrogatives  of  the  form  ?xPx  and  ?x¬Px  holds  only  if 
we assume that the domain from which the instances are drawn are fixed.” (G & S 
1997) 

•	

25)	

This  is  good.  Consider  the  following  examples  (due  to  Angelika  Kratzer,  class 
notes. Some names changed.) 

I  can  tell  you  which  students  were  admitted,  but  I  can’t  tell  you  which  students 
weren’t. That’s confidential information. 

26)	

Irene has posted the list of the new students admitted to the graduate program. 

Has she informed us which students were admitted? 

Has she informed us which students were not admitted? 

•	

•	

In  all  worlds  compatible  with  the  information  Irene  gave  us  the  set  of  admitted 
students is the same as the set of actually admitted students. 

Not predicted to be valid: 

27)	

Irene informed us who was admitted. 

Spencer Hubbard was not admitted.

Feymann example. 

29)	 Feynman knew which elementary particles had been discovered by 1978, but he 
didn’t know which ones hadn’t (Bromberger, p. c. to Lahiri) 

In all of Feynman’s belief worlds the elementary particles discovered by 1978 are 
the same as those discovered by 1978 in the actual world. 

Feynman didn’t know what the complete set of elementary particles was. Hence his 
belief worlds differed among themselves as to the  complete inventory of 
elementary particles. 

And therefore, there were at least some of Feynman’s belief worlds, where the not 
yet discovered elementary particles were not the same as those in the actual world. 

But… 

•	

30)	

However,  there  are  cases  where  the  domain  is  fixed,  and  still  the  negative 
extension and the positive extension come out as different. 

(a) 
(b)	

It surprised me who was at the party. 
It surprised me who was not at the party 

It seems that (a) can be false and (b) true, regardless of whether the domain is fixed 
or not.  Consider a situation in which everyone who was at 
the 
party  was 
expected to be there by the speaker, but some people who were  also  expected  to  be 
there did not show up. (Judgments?).
