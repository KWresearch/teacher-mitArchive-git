Schlenker 2006 

1 

For Schlenker (like Heim and Stalnaker), the problem of projection is the following: 

Given an atomic sentence, S, with presupposition p (henceforth Sp), define constraints on 
the CG for the assertion of various sentences that dominate S.   

1. Generalization 

(1) 	

1 is assertable in a 
Schlenker’s Generalization: A sentence, X, that dominates Sp
context C iff, X[Sp/p∧Sp] is not assertable in C. 

Evidence: 

(2) 
 

Context: Mary just announced that she is pregnant.  
  Mary’s Husband: 
a.  ?She is pregnant and she is happy about the fact that she is pregnant. 
b.  She is happy about the fact that she is pregnant. 

(3)  a.  ?If Mary is pregnant, she is pregnant and she knows that she is pregnant.   
b.  If Mary is pregnant, she knows that she is pregnant. 

(4)  a.  ?Mary is pregnant and she is pregnant and she knows that she is pregnant.   
b.  Mary is pregnant and she knows that she is pregnant. 

2. Proposal-first version2 

Schlenker’s Generalization is entirely expected in Heim’s framework (Schlenker pc). 
However, Schlenker observes that one can have a predictive statement of the 
environments in which X[Sp/p∧ Sp] is not assertable, and subsequently a predictive 
statement of the projection properties. 

(5) 	

Constraint on Conjunction (version 1) 
A sentence, X, which dominates p∧q, is not assertable in C if: 

∀r [X[p∧q/ p∧r] ⇔C X[p∧q/ r]] 

(the first conjunct is idle no matter what the second conjunct is) 

Let’s see how this deals with a few basic cases 

1 and does not dominate other presupposition bearing atomic sentences. The more general statement is the 
following: 

(i) 	

A sentence, X, that dominates a set of presupposition triggers Si
pis is assertable in a context C iff, 
for every i, X[Si
pi/pi∧ Si
pi] is not assertable in C. 

2 What I present is the proposal developed in sections 4.2.-5.1 (“Global Presuppositional Transparency”), 
rather than the proposal presented in greater detail at the beginning of the paper (“Incremental 
Presuppositional Transparency”).

3. Some of Heim’s Results 

3.1. Unembedded Sp 

2 

Sp is assertable in C iff p∧Sp is unassertable in C.  

p∧Sp is unassertable in C (given (5)), iff [p∧r] ⇔C r, for any choice of r, i.e., iff C⇒p. 

Hence Sp will presuppose p. 


3.2. ¬Sp 

¬Sp is assertable in C iff ¬[p∧Sp] is unassertable in C.  

¬[p∧Sp] is unassertable in C (given ( 5)), iff ¬[p∧r] ⇔C  ¬r, for any choice of r, i.e., iff  

C⇒p. Hence ¬Sp will presuppose p.  


3.3.  S1∧Sp 

S1∧Sp is assertable in C iff S1∧(p∧Sp) is unassertable in C. 

S1∧(p∧Sp) is unassertable in C (given ( 5)), iff S1∧(p∧r) ⇔C S1∧r, for any choice of r, i.e., 

iff C∧S1⇒p. 

Hence S1∧Sp will presuppose S1→p. 


3.4. S1→Sp 

S1→Sp is assertable in C iff S1→ (p∧Sp) is unassertable in C. 
S1→ (p∧Sp) is unassert. in C (given ( 5)), iff S1→ (p∧r) ⇔C S1→r, for any choice of r, i.e., 
iff C∧S1⇒p. 
Hence S1→Sp will presuppose S1→p. 

4. Symmetry in Disjunction 

4.1. S1∨Sp 

S1∨Sp is assertable in C iff S1∨ (p∧Sp) is unassertable in C. 
S1∨ (p∧Sp) is unassertable in C (given ( 5)), iff S1∨ (p∧r) ⇔C S1∨r, for any choice of r, 
i.e., iff C∧¬S1⇒p. 
Hence S1∨Sp will presuppose ¬S1→p. 

This seems to be a good result: 

(6)  Either this house has no bathroom, or the bathroom is well hidden.

4.2. Sp∨S1 

 

3 

Sp∨S1 is assertable in C iff (p∧Sp)∨ S1 is unassertable in C. 

(p∧Sp)∨ S1 is unassertable in C (given ( 5)), iff (p∧r)∨ S1 ⇔C r ∨ S1, for any choice of r, 

i.e., iff C∧¬S1⇒p. 

Hence Sp∨S1 will presuppose ¬S1→p. 


This also seems to be good result: 


(7)  Either the bathroom is well hidden, or there is no bathroom. 

5. [¬Sp]→S1 

[¬Sp]→S1 is assertable in C iff [¬(p∧Sp)]→S1 is unassertable in C. 
[¬(p∧Sp)]→S1 is unassertable in C (given ( 5)), iff [¬(p∧r)]→S1 ⇔C [¬r]→S1, for any 
choice of r, i.e., iff [¬S1→ (p∧r)]→ ⇔C [¬S1→ r], i.e., iff C∧¬S1⇒p. 

Hence [¬Sp]→S1 will presuppose ¬S1→p (i.e, the same presupposition as that of a 
disjunction of Sp or S1). 

This presupposition is radically different from that of Heim, and Philippe presents 
evidence in its support: 

(8) 

a. If Mary is pregnant, her doctor knows that she is pregnant. 
b. If Mary’s doctor doesn’t know that she is pregnant, she isn’t pregnant. 

We want to generalize these results. Schlenker discusses this in a separate paper that I 
haven’t read…A naïve first step: 

6. ¬A when A presupposes p and dominates a single atomic Sq. 

A presupposes p. Hence A[Sq/q∧Sq] is unassertable in C iff C⇒p. Given ( 5), C⇒p iff for 
any choice of r A[Sq/q∧r] ⇔C A[Sq/r]. Since X ⇔C Y iff ¬X ⇔C ¬Y, we derive 

C⇒p iff for any choice of r ¬A[Sq/q∧r] ⇔C ¬A[Sq/r]. I.e., we derive that ¬A 
presupposes p. 

Homework (optional): see what happens with the other connectives, and when you allow 
for more than one presupposition trigger ☺ 

7. Symmetry in Conjunction? 

Sp∧S1: Sp∧S1 is assertable in C iff (p∧Sp)∧S1 is unassertable in C. 
(p∧Sp)∧S1 is unassertable in C (given ( 5)), iff (p∧r)∧S1 ⇔C r∧S1, for any choice of r, i.e., 
iff C∧S1⇒p.

This doesn’t seems to be good result: #Sp∧p 

(9)  #The king of France is bald and France has a king. 

8. Proposal

(10) 	 Constraint on Conjunction (version 2) 
A sentence, X, that dominates p∧q is not assertable in C if one of the following 
holds: 
a.  ∀r [X[p∧q/ p∧r] ⇔C X[p∧q/ r]] 
b. 
[X[p∧q] ⇔C X[p∧q/ p]] 

(the first conjunct is idle no matter what the second conjunct is) 
(the second conjunct is idle given the first conjunct) 

9. Further Evidence 

9.1. No presupposition when p ⇒ Sp 

(11) 	

(12) 	

a.  The king of France exists. 
b.  ?France has a king and the king of France exists 

a.  The king of France doesn’t exist. 
b.  ?It’s not the case that France has a king and the king of France exists 

9.2. Sp∧S1 where S1 is more informative than p. 

(13) 	

a.  I can tell you that John knows he is sick and that he has cancer. 
b.  Is it true that John knows he is sick and that he has cancer? 
c.  It’s not the case that John knows he is sick and that he has cancer. 

10. Disjunction (potential problem) 

(14) 	 Either this house has no bathroom, or it has a bathroom and the bathroom is well 
hidden. 
(Schlenker pc, attributing to Heim pc) 

We get the right projection for disjunction based on our constraints on conjunction, but 
the constraints on conjunction seem to give the wrong results.  

Basic fact 


(p∨q) ⇔ (p∨([¬p]∧q)) 


Could we capitalize on the following fact?  


¬[(p∇q) ⇔ (p∇([¬p]∧q))] 


See our discussion of Hurford’s constraint.

a.  Every one of these ten boys drives his car to school. 
b. 	 At least one of these ten boys drives his car to school. 

(16) 	 Every A [λx.[B(x)]p(x)]. 
For transparency we will write  
∀x[A(x) → Bp(x)] 

∀x[A(x) → Bp(x)] is assertable in C iff ∀x[A(x) → p(x)∧ Bp(x)] is unassertable in C. 
∀x[A(x) → p(x)∧Bp(x)] is unassertable in C (given ( 5)), iff  
∀x[A(x) → p(x)∧R(x)] ⇔C  ∀x[A(x) →  R(x)], for any choice of R, i.e., iff 
C ⇒ ∀x[A(x) → p(x)]. 

Proof (of the last iff statement): 

1.  Assume C ⇒ ∀x[A(x) → p(x)], then 
2. 
	Assume ∀x[A(x) →  R(x)]. It automatically follows that  
∀x[A(x) →  p(x)∧R(x)]

 

 
 
 

1. 
	Assume ∀x[A(x) →  R(x)] ⇔C  ∀x[A(x) →  p(x)∧R(x)] 
2. 	 Choose for R the tautological preidicate (λx. x=x).  

We now get in C

∃x[A(x)∧Bp(x)] is assertable in C iff ∃x[A(x)∧ p(x)∧ Bp(x)] is unassertable in C. 

∃x[A(x)∧ p(x)∧ Bp(x)] is unassertable in C (given ( 5)), iff  

∃x[A(x)∧ p(x)∧ R(x)] ⇔C  ∃x[A(x)∧R(x)], for any choice of R, i.e., iff

Proof (of the last iff statement):

∃x[A(x)∧ p(x)∧ R(x)] 

1.  Assume ∃x[A(x)∧ p(x)∧ R(x)] ⇔C  ∃x[A(x)∧R(x)] 
2.  Let a∈A, and choose for R the predicate λx. x=a (if A is empty, we’re done) 
3.  Since ∃x[A(x)∧x=a], we conclude by 1, ∃x[A(x)∧p(x)∧x=a]. 
4.  This x can only be a, hence p(a). 
5.  This hold for any a∈A, hence ∀x[A(x) → p(x)] 

Note: As pointed out by Heim (1983), and later by Beaver, this prediction seems too 
strong. 

A few of these 10 women are pregnant. (?) Furthermore, at least one of these 10 women 
is pregnant and happy to be pregnant.  

Each of these 10 women is pregnant. (?) Furthermore, at least one of these 10 women is 
pregnant and happy to be pregnant.  

(18) 	 Constraint on Conjunction (speculation, will be too weak for what follows) 
A sentence, X, that dominates p∧q is not assertable in C if one of the following 
holds: 
[X[p∧q/ p∧r] ⇔C X[p∧q/ r]]  where r is a tautology 
a. 
 
(the first conjunct is idle given a  tautological second conjunct) 
[X[p∧q] ⇔C X[p∧q/ p]] 
(the second conjunct is idle given the first conjunct)

Universal Quantifiers 

(19) 	 Among these ten boys  
a.  Every one who likes his car bought this policy. 
b.  At least one person who likes his car bought this policy. 

(20) 	 ∀x[NP(x)∧RCp(x) → B(x)] 

∀x[NP(x)∧RCp(x) → B(x)] is assertable in C iff ∀x[NP(x)∧p(x)∧RCp(x) → B(x)] is 
unassertable in C. 
∀x[NP(x)∧p(x)∧RCp(x) → B(x)] is unassertable in C (given ( 5)), iff

3.  Let x∈NP∩R. Given 1, x∈p or x ∈B. If x∈p (by 2) x∈B, hence in either 
case x∈B. Hence ∀x[NP(x)∧R(x) → B(x)]

1.  Assume ∀x[NP(x)∧p(x)∧R(x) → B(x)] ⇔C  ∀x[NP(x)∧R(x) → B(x)] 
2. 	 Let R be the complement of p, we derive:  
∀x[NP(x)∧p(x)∧¬p(x) → B(x)] ⇔C  ∀x[NP(x) )∧¬p(x) → B(x)] 
3. 	 Since the left hand side is a tautology, C ⇒ ∀x[NP(x)∧¬p(x) → B(x)] 
⇒ ∀x(NP(x) → [p(x) ∨ B(x)]) 

This is very different from what is commonly assumed, but is it necessarily a bad result? 

Not obvious to me: 

( 19)a suggests that every boy has a car, but that might be an artifact of the particular 

example (of our particular choice for the predicate B): buying the (relevant) policy 

suggests owning a car. Things don’t seem very different in ( 21).  


(21) 	 Among these ten boys everyone who didn’t buy this policy doesn’t like his car. 

Consider the following: 

(22) 	 Among these ten boys  
a. 	 Everyone who is sick knows that he is sick. 
b.  	 Everyone who doesn’t know he is sick isn’t sick. 

(23) 	 Among these ten boys, everyone who doesn’t have a car is a friend of mine. 
Also everyone who hates his car is a friend of mine. 

Existential Quantifiers 

(24) 	 ∃x[NP(x)∧RCp(x)∧B(x)] 

∃x[NP(x)∧RCp(x)∧B(x)] is assertable in C iff ∃x[NP(x)∧ p(x)∧ RCp(x)∧B(x)] is 
unassertable in C. 
∃x[NP(x)∧ p(x)∧ RCp(x)∧B(x)] is unassertable in C (given ( 5)), iff  
∃x[NP(x)∧ p(x)∧ RCp(x)∧B(x)] ⇔C  ∃x[NP(x)∧ p(x)∧ RCp(x)∧B(x)], for any choice of 
R, i.e., iff 
∃x[NP(x)∧ B(x) ∧ p(x)∧ RCp(x)] ⇔C  ∃x[NP(x)∧B(x)∧ RCp(x)], 
i.e., iff 
C ⇒ ∀x(NP(x)∧B(x)  → p(x)) 

This is again very non-traditional, but is it obviously bad?

 (25) 	 a. Among these ten boys, at least one person who likes his car is a friend of mine. 
b. Among these ten boys, at least one person who is a friend of mine likes his car.
