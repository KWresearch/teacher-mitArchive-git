Part 1 

1. 

1) 

Go back to Irene’s objection briefly and present Angelika’s reply. 

Discuss Emmanuel’s example and Angelika’s reply. 

A  cursory  glance  to  Quantificational  Variability  Effects  in  questions  (just  the 
facts!) 

Kratzer  also  discusses  a  second  puzzle:  Quantificational  Variability  Effects 
in  questions.  We  won’t  discuss  her  account  in  class.  But  I  will  present  the 
phenomenon  in  case  you  guys  want  to  work  your  way  through  the  rest  of  the 
handout. 

Reminder: Kratzer’s proposal 

The video shows which of those animals the man fed 

The  video  shows  an  actual  situation  s  that  exemplifies  [[which  of  those 
animals the man fed]] (w0). 

[[which of those animals the man fed]] (w0)= 

λs [λx  [fed(x)(the man)(s) &  animals(x)(s)]  = λx  [fed(x)(the man)(w0) &  animal 
(x)(w0)]] 

2) 

The video shows which of those animals the man didn’t feed 

The video shows an actual situation s that exemplifies [[which of  those  animals 
the man didn’t feed]] (w0). 

[[which of those animals the man didn’t feed]] (w0) = 
λs
[λx  [~  fed(x)(the  man)(s)  &  animals(x)(s)]  =  λx  [~  fed(x)(the  man)(w0)  & 
animal (x)(w0)]]

Since the positive and the negative question extensions are not exemplified by  the 
same situations, (1) and (2) come out as having different truth-conditions. 

Irene’s objection 

The positive and the negative extension of the question are the same proposition! 

We  assumed  that  the  set  of  relevant  animals  was  {a,  b,  c,  d}  and  replaced  the 
condition ‘animal(x)(s)’ by ‘x ∈ {a, b, c, d}’ 

[[which of those animals the man fed]] (w0)= 
λs
[λx  [fed(x)(the  man)(s)  &  x  ∈  {a,  b,  c}]  =  λx  [fed(x)(the  man)(w0)  &  x 
∈{a,  b, c, d} & x in w0] 

[[which of those animals the man didn’t feed]] (w0) = 
λs [λx [~ fed(x)(the man)(s) & x ∈ {a, b, c, d}] = λx [~ fed(x)(the man)(w0)  &  x 
∈ {a, b, c, d} &  x in w0] 

(5)  and  (6)  are  indeed  equivalent.  [exercise:  show  this].  To  get  an  intuitive 
understanding, suppose that the man fed a and b and didn’t feed c and d, 

[[which of those animals the man fed]] (w0)= 
λs [λx [fed(x)(the man)(s) & x ∈ {a, b, c}] = {a, b} 

[[which of those animals the man didn’t feed]] (w0) = 
λs [λx [~ fed(x)(the man)(s) & x ∈ {a, b, c, d}] = {c, d} 

and  consider  the  following  types  of  situations  (courtesy  of  Angelika  Kratzer,  in  email 
correspondence). 

a.	

Possible  situations  in  which  the  man  fed  only  a.  Both  (5’)  and  (6’)  are  false. 
The negative one  is  false  too  (note:  the  set  of  animals  that  the man didn’t  feed  in 
these  situations  is  {c,  d,  b}.  Here  is  where  I  think  I  got  confused  last  time.  “the 
man didn’t feed b in s” can be true even if b doesn’t exist in s.] 

(same for situations in which the man fed only b).

Possible  situations  in which  the man  fed  a  and  b and  no  other  animals.  Both  (5’) 
and (6’) are true. 

Possible  situations  in  which  the  man  fed  no  animals  whatsoever. Both  (5’)  and 
(6’)  are  false  [note:  the  set  of  animals  that  the man didn’t  feed  in  those  situations 
is {a, b, c, d}] 

Possible situations in which  the man fed  a, b, and  c, but not d.  Both (5’) and (6’) 
are false. (There’s just one animal that didn’t get fed.) 

Possible situations in which the man fed a, b, c, and d. Both (5’) and (6’) are false. 

… etc. 

Angelika’s reply 

We  shouldn’t  have  replaced  the  condition  ‘animal(x)(s)’  by  ‘x  ∈  {a,  b,  c}’.  The 
condition  ‘animal(x)(s)’  is  to  be  read  as  ‘x  is  an  animal  that  exists  in  s’  (cf. 
Emmanuel’s suggestion). This is crucial for the proposal to work. 

[[which of those animals the man fed]] (w0)= 

λs [λx  [fed(x)(the man)(s) &  animals(x)(s)]  = λx  [fed(x)(the man)(w0) &  animal 
(x)(w0)]] 

the proposition that is true in a situation s if the animals that exist  in s and that the 
man fed  in s are the same as the animals that exist in  the actual world and  that the 
man fed in the actual world. 

8) 

[[which of those animals the man didn’t feed]] (w0) = 
λs
[λx  [~  fed(x)(the  man)(s)  &  animals(x)(s)]  =  λx  [~  fed(x)(the  man)(w0)  & 
animal (x)(w0)]] 

the proposition that is true in a situation s if the animals that exist  in s and that the 
man didn’t feed  in s are the same  as the animals that exist  in  the actual world and 
that the man didn’t fed in the actual world.

Now: 

• 

(7) and (8) are NOT logically equivalent. 

11/14/06 

Again, suppose that the actual animals are a, b, c and d, and that the man fed a and 
b but didn’t feed c and d. 

Consider  a  situation  s2  that  contains  the  man  feeding  a  and  b,  poor  c  lies  about 
unfed and nothing else happens. 

(7) is true in s2: the set of animals that exist in s2 and that are fed in s2 is {a, b} 
(7) is false in s2: the set of animals that exist in s2 and that are not fed in s2  is {c} 
≠  ({c, d}) 

• 

• 

(7) and (8) are exemplified by different situations. 

But what about

8’)  Which of a, b and c the man didn’t feed.

In class, we decided we need:

Part 2.	

Emmanuel’s question 

Scenario: The Fake Feeding. 

Suppose  that  there  are  four  relevant  animals,  a,  b,  c,  and  d.  In  the  actual  world, 
the man fed  three of  those animals, a, b and  c. The video depicts the man  feeding 
a,  b  and  c,  but  it  also  depicts  the man  feeding  a  fourth  animal,  d. The  only  thing 
that the video shows are these four feedings. 

Intuition:	

the sentence in (9) is false in this scenario.  (do people agree? Is it possible 
to judge (9) true in this scenario?) 

9)	

The video shows which of those animals the man fed. 

Prediction (of what we have so far): (7) is true in this scenario. 

The  video  shows  a  situation  in  which  the  man  feeds  a,  b,  c  and  d.  But  the  video 
ALSO  shows  a  situation  where  the  man  fed  a,  b,  c  and  nothing  else  happens. 
Thus,  the  video  shows  a  situation  that  exemplifies  [[which  of  those  animals  the 
man fed]] (w0). 

First try: 

•	

But  the  complete  situation  that  the  video  shows  is  not  an  actual  situation  (in  the 
actual world,  there is no situation  in which the man fed a, b, c and d). Thus, no part 
of  that  situation  is  an  actual  situation  (remember  that  the  part-whole  relation  only 
holds  between  situations  in  the  same world).  So  it  is  not  true  that  the  video  shows 
an actual situation that exemplifies [[which of those animals the man fed]] (w0). 

Yes, but… 

•	 What if we record the actual feeding, and then we film a fake feeding, and the video 
shows  the  two  feedings  (actual  and  fake)  in  succession?  Then  (7)  will  come  out 
true… 

[question: does the judgment change if we set up the scenario this way?] 

Angelika’s reply (see slide 22)

informational content. 

The  video  shows  a  situation  that  exemplifies  Q(w0)  and  in  all  possible  worlds 
compatible with the content of the video, Q(w0)  is true in the counterpart of s.

•	

As we  saw  last  time,  in Kratzer’s  situation  semantics  no  given  possible  situation 
can be  part of more than one world. 

Here, Kratzer  follows David Lewis,  according  to  whom  individuals  are  world-
bound:  no  individual  can  exist  in  more  than  one  world  (see  Lewis  1968,  1973, 
1986). 

To replace the relation of identity between entities that are not in the same worlds, 
Lewis introduces counterpart relations between individuals. 

Crucially, there is not just one fixed counterpart relation: 

“Things  resemble  and  d iffer  from  one  another  in  many  different  respects.  There  are 
countless  ways  to  amalgamate  similar ities  and  differences  in to  a  resultant  relation  of 
overall  similar ity .  Hence  we  are  not  stuck  with  one  fixed  counterpart  relation.  Our  daggers 
[PMB: Lewis is d iscussing an examp le in wh ich Macbeth the hallucinatory sees a 
dagger] 
can  be  noncounterparts  in  one way  and  counterparts  in  another,  and  so  can  be  a multitude  in 
one way and a def inite indiv idual in another”  (Lewis 1983: 7-8) 

(see Lewis 1983 for lots of discussion. ) 

Back to our example:


11) 

12) 

•	

•	

•	

•	

The video shows which animals the man fed.


The  video  shows  a  situation  that  exemplifies  Q(w0)  and  in  all  possible  worlds

compatible with the content of the video, Q(w0)  is true in the counterpart of s. 

Angelika:  The  most  natural  counterpart  relation  is  one  where  the  complete  actual 
feeding  situation  (THE  feeding)  is  related  to  the  complete  feeding  situation  (THE 
feeding) in the accessible worlds. 

If  the  counterpart  relation  is  such  that  the  complete  actual  feeding  situation  is 
related  to  the  complete  feeding  situations  in  the  worlds  compatible  with  the 
information in the video, then (9) comes out as false in Emmanuel’s scenario. 

If  (9)  can  be  judged  true  in  Emmanuel’s  scenario,  that’s  good  news.  Even  if  we 
assume  that  show  always  contributes  informational  content  (unlike  direct 
perception  see), we  could  account  for  the  two  intuitions by  the  two  salient ways of 
construing the counterpart relation. 

But  if  (9)  is  always  judged  as  false  in  Emmanuel’s  scenario,  it’s  not  clear  (at  least 
to me!) how we could account for this in the account above.

Part 3: 

Quantificational Variability Effects 

The Phenomenon 

(here,  I  will  follow  closely  the  presentation  in  Lahiri  2002:  63-65.  All  the  examples 
below are taken for there.)

15)	

In many  languages,  indefinites  exhibit  quantificational  variability  effects  (QVEs) 
when  combined with adverbs of quantification: 

(a) 
(b)	
(c)	
(d)	

A man rarely loves his enemies. 
A man usually hates his enemies. 
A man sometimes loves his enemies. 
A man hates his enemies 

We can roughly state the truth-conditions of the sentences above as: 

(a) 
(b)	
(c)	
(d)	

Few(x) [man (x)] [x loves x’s enemies] 
Most(x) [man (x)] [x hates x’s enemies] 
∃(x) [man (x)] [x hates x’s enemies] 
GEN(x) [man(x)] [x hates x’s enemies] 

Kamp  1981,  Heim  1982  (building  on  Lewis  1975):  in  these  sentences  the 
indefinites  do  not  have  any  quantificational  force  of  their  own.  They  introduce  a 
variable  together  with  a  restriction,  and  get  their  quantificational  force  from  the 
adverb  of  quantification  (in  (d)  the  presence  of  a  covert  generic  operator  is 
assumed). 

Berman  1987  and  many  others:  these  sentences  involve  quantification  over 
situations. 

Berman 1991, 1994: some sentences with embedded questions exhibit QVEs: 

Sue mostly remembers what she got for her birthday. 
(a) 
Bill knows, for the most part, what they serve for breakfast at Tiffany’s. 
(b)	
(c)	
Mary largely realized what they serve for breakfast at Tiffany’s. 
(d)	 With few exceptions, John knows who likes Mary. 
To a considerable extent, the operating system lists what bugs might 
(e)	
occur. 
The school paper recorded, in part, who made the dean’s list. 
The conductor usually/seldom finds out who rides the train without 
paying. 

(f)	
(g)	

Quantificational force derived from the adverb of quantification. Berman:

(a)  cannot  mean  ‘for  most  x  such  that  Sue  got  x  for  her  b-day…’;  (b)  and  (c) 
barely make sense. 

An analysis of QVE  in questions must (i) derive the truth-conditions of sentences 
like (36) and (ii) explain the lack of QVE in (17). 

There  are  several  accounts  of  QVE  in  the  market  (see,  e.g.,  Lahiri  2002,  and 
references therein). We won’t go through them. At this point, just think
