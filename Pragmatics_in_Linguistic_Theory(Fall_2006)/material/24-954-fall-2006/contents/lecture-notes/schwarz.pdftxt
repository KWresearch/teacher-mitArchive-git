General questions 
When  are  presuppositions  computed?  How  quickly  are  they  accessible  to  the 
parser? (late process vs. on-line computation) [note similarity with debate  on 
implicatures].  From  an  update  semantics  perspective:  when/where  do  context
updates take place? 
Do  presuppositions  interact  with  other  factors  relevant  in  parsing  (i.e.,  syntactic 
preferences.)  Cf.  Crain  and  Steedman  (1985)  [see  Schwarz  paper  for  more 
recent  references] 
The horse raced past  the barn fell

(a)	
[[the horse] [raced pas t the barn ]] 
(b)	
[the horse raced past the barn] 
Analys is in (a)  is preferred to the analysis  in (b); strong garden pa th effect. 
Garden-path  theory:  (i)  analysis  (a)  is  preferred  to  analysis  (b)  on  the  grounds  of 
structural  stra tegies  (e .g.,  Fodor  &  Frazier’s  Minimal  Attachmen t:  use  as  few  new 
nodes as possible) Serial model: only pre ferred ana lysis is  initially computed . 
C & S’s  explana tion :  (b)  is  presuppositionally  more  complex  than  (a):  (b)  “includes 
several horses rather than one, and a number o f further fac ts  about  the  basis  on 
which  they  can  be  distinguished”  [measure  o f  complexity?].  Parallel  model:  several 
analyses  are compu ted at the same time . 
The Principle of Parsimony:  If  there  is  a  reading  that  carries  fewer  unsatisfied  bu t 
consisten t  presuppositions  or  entailments  than  any  other,  then,  o ther  criter ia  of 
plausibility being equal,  tha t reading will be adop ted as most plaus ible by  the hearer, and 
the presuppositions  in question will be incorpora ted in h is or her  model. 
•  C  &  S  1985 :  Sentences  like  (3m)  judged  gramma tical  more  often  than  sentences 
like  (1) [o ff-line s tudy; results ac tually compatible with both theories]

Why do experiments on presuppositions? 
[see Schwarz ’s slides at http://people.umass.edu/florian/] 
Provide new data for semantic theory 
Questions of timing may be crucial: local vs. global issue. 

Inform theory of semantic processing 
We know little about when/how semantic processing takes place. 

Processing  of  presuppositions  provides  insights  about  an  important  part  of 
semantic process: integration with the context. 
Experiments 
How can we test the effects of presuppositions in processing?

When auch is  present  the otherwise dispreferred  choice of paraphrase  is chosen 
more  frequently  than  when  it  is  not,  presumably  because  this  order  yields 
satisfaction  of  the  presupposition.  Effect  significant  in  both  clause  orders  but 
stronger in the RC-MC order.

Assume a serial model of processing  in which perceivers  initially pursue only one 
analysis, the one that is syntactically preferred. 
Perceivers  will  go  for  the  SO  interpretation  of  the  ambiguous  clause.  Upon 
realization  of  the  presupposition  failure,  they  wil l  reanalyze,  at  least  in  some  of 
the trials. 
Reanalysis  eas ier  when  RC  is  ambiguous.  Harder  when  the  MC  is  ambiguous, 
since  this  requires  that  the  initial  DP  wil l  be  interpreted  as  topic,  which  is  not 
supported by the context. 

In  order  to  in terpre t  the  firs t  DP  as  topic,  its  re ferent  would  have  to  have  been 
mentioned  previously  –  and  (roughly)  the  d iscourse  should  be  “about”  that 
ind ividual. 
One possible way of licens ing topics  is by means o f a contrastive topic : 
We saw a man and a boy today. The man I talked  to. 
General poin t: in order  to have an ob ject DP in sentence initial position, some non-de fault 
context  is needed . But  these sen tences are  read  in  isolation , so  the spec ial  requirements 
for ob ject top ics, wha tever that may be, can't be sa tisfied. 

Practice  effect:  increase  in  the  percentage  of  OS  paraphrases  in  second  half  of 
questionnaire.  In  the  RC-MC  order  there  was  only  a  small  numerical  increase, 
not  significant.  Supports  the  conclusion  that  it  is  harder  to  get  the  OS  I 
interpretation  in  the  MC-RC  order.  “Apparentely,  perceivers  become  more  likely 
to  choose  the OS-interpretation after  having been  exposed  to a  number  of  these
constructions  and paraphrases  for  the MC-RC order, whereas  they  start  out  as  a 
fairly high level for the other clause order”.

Asymmetry between RC and MC.  This tells us that: 

•	
(i) 
The differences between MC and RC are not due to parallelism 
What does this mean? 

Processing  advan tage  for  parallel  struc tures  (NP  coordination  (Fraz ier  et  al.,  2000), 
sentence  coordina tion  (Frazier  e t  al.,  1984) ,  and  gapping  and  ellipsis  (Carlson ,  2002 ; 
Mauner e t al., 1995) . 
Terry wrote a long novel and a short poem during her sabbatical. 
a. 
b.	
Terry wrote a novel and a shor t poem during her sabba tical 
Frazier e t a l. 2000 , eye-movement s tudy: 
Total RTs  for  the  underlined  region were  faster  in  (8a),  where short poem is  coordinated 
with  a  syn tactically  paralle l  noun  phrase  (a  long  novel),  than  in  (8b),  where  it  is 
coordinated with a syn tactically non-parallel phrase . 
In the firs t four conditions : 

•	
C1: OS in the MC . So choosing the OS order  in the RC would give us a para llel struc ture. 
Die Frau , d ie das Madchen sah , hatte auch der Mann gesehen
C1: 
The womanN /A whoN/A the girlN /A saw had a lso the manN gesehen 
C3: SO in the RC. So choosing the OS order in the MC would give us a non-parallel s tructure. 
Die Frau , sah das Madchen , auch das auch den Mann gesehen ha tte
C3: 
The womanN /A saw the girl N/A who N /A a lso the manA seen had. 
Thus, we could hypo thesize that the asymmetry between RC and MC is due to parallelism. 
But  in  C5 ,  choosing  the  OS  order  in  the  RC  doesn ’t  yield  a  para llel  s tructure  [on  the 
reading where the presupposition is satisfied] 
Die Frau , sah das Madchen , auch die LehrerinN /A gesehen ha tte 
The womanN /A saw the girl N/A who N /A a lso the teacherN/A seen had . 
OS order  in the RC:

The woman saw the g irl tha t the teacher had also seen .

This  asymmetry  also  helps  fend  off  another  alternative  hypothesis:  higher 
percentage  of  OS  interpretation  for  RC-MC  order  is  due  to  the  obligatory  OS 
interpretation of matrix clause. [no obligatory OS order of MC in C5] 
Overall conc lusion: 
Presupposition interacts with other parsing factors .

Auch region  read  faster  in  the  OS  condition  –  ps  satisfied  –  than  in  the  SO

Additional effect: auch is faster than vorher in OS.

Big  s lowdown  when 
that 
the  presupposition 
follow-up 
presupposition is computed online [but see caveat  below 
and 
experiment] 
The  advantage  of  the  auch  condition  in  the  OS  version  might  be  that 
presupposed  content  facilitates  the  integration  of  new  content  into  contextual 
information,  by  connecting new and old  information (But  it could also be due  to a 
lexical effect) 

Theoretical implications 
The RC in C1 (SPR) satisfies the presupposition of auch. 

Die Frau 
/  hatte auch der Mann gesehen. 
/  die der Junge sah 
The womanN/A who N/A the boyN saw/  had also the manN seen. 
The woman that the boy saw had also been seen by the man. 

The  context  with  respect  to  which  the  auch presupposition  is  evaluated  must 
already inc lude the content of the RC. 
So the initial context must be updated with the content of the initial DP.

propositions with free variables in them.

c’ + x was also seen by the man 
{g: g verifies woman (x) & boy (y) & see (x)(y) & man (z) & see (x)(y )} 

The  semantics  has  to  update  the  sentence  bit  by  bit,  so  that  auch  is 
evaluated with respect to the local context c’. 
“The  more  general  picture  (…)  is  that  in  process ing,  the  context  is  updated  as
soon  as  possible.  Since  noun  phrases  have  context  change  potentials  of  their
own,  the  processor  can update  the  context  as  soon  as  it  has  been  given  a  noun
phrase” 
Results  show  that  the  processor  goes  about  interpreting  a  sentence  in  steps 
much like the ones assumed by dynamic semantic  theories. 
Do we have conclusive evidence that update happens on the fly? 

NOT YET.

The critical region in the SPR is sentence final. So: the update could 

take place on the fly. 
Be applied to the whole sentence in the end.

Significant interaction: Difference between C1 and C2 significantly bigger  than 
difference between C3 and C4. 
RTs  slower  when  presupposition  is  not  satisfied  (and  effect  can’t  be  due  to 
parallelism.) 
Evidence  that  update  happens  on  the  fly:  effect  shows  up  right  away  (in  a  non-
final region). 
Other notes: 

RTs  much  more  normal  –  ununsually  slow  in auch study  –  probably  due  to  the
questions  that  were  asked  after  experimental  items  (hard  to  figure  out  who  did
that to whom). 
There was a highly significant main effect for relative clause order, with subject 
relative clauses being over 250ms faster than object relative clauses. This 
indicates that we are at a speed where we see normal online effects.

In  the auch study,  the auch region  was  read  faster  than  the vorher region  when 
the  presupposition  was  satisfied.  Hypothesis:  when  the  presupposition  is 
satisfied,  this  speeds  up  integration  of  new  information.  But  this  could  also  be  a 
lexical  effect.  To  rule  out  that  possibility,  different  types  of  adverbs  were  used  in 
the control  conditions  of  the English  study. But:  no significant  difference between 
adverb and also in this study.

Representational vs. non-representational theories. 

Questionnaire:  presupposition  failure  triggers  reanalysis.  “The  fact  that  this 
revision  is  even  considered  indicates  that  the  meaning  of  the  relative  clause  is 
already  accessible  to  the  parser  at  the  time  it  encounters  the  presupposition. 
With  respect  to  this  point,  representational  theories  such  as  DRT  might  have  an 
advantage  over  non-representational  theories  such  as  update  semantics.  When 
the  parser  considers  the  revision  of  the  analysis  of  the  relative  clause,  it  must
somehow  see  that  the  reversal  of  the  roles  of  the  subject  and  object  yields  an
interpretation  that will  just  be of  the  right kind  to satisfy  the presupposition of too. 
This  is  easily  imaginable  if  the  parser  has  access  to  the  representations  such as 
see(x,y),  but  possibly  problematic  if  all  the  parser  can  see  is  syntactic  structure
and propos itons. Since there is no obvious connection or relation between the set 
of  worlds  in  which  x  sees  y  and  the  set  of  wor lds  in  which  y  sees  x,  having
access  to  the  propos itional  meaning  only  does  not  seem  to  be  enough  to  trigger
reanalys is” (pp. 31-32). 
If we  were  really  operating  on  the  representations , we  would  expect  a  difference 
between  the  first 12 sentences and  the  last 12 sentences.  If we don’t,  this shows 
that we are targeting a deeper level of representation. 
In  fact,  there  is  no  significant difference between  the cases  where  the same  verb 
was used and the cases where different verbs were used. 
[caveat: this argument only works if VP focus is not possible].
