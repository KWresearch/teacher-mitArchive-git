Too Many Alternatives: density, symmetry and other predicaments

Danny Fox, MIT  


Goals 

1.  	 To review the argument for density (and modularity) made in Fox and Hackl (in press) 
2. 	 To provide evidence that the core generalizations we argued for are attested in areas for 
which an account in terms of density is not available  
3. 	 To suggest that our account might nevertheless be right: density is a special case in which 
exhaustivity fails, but other cases are predicted as well 
4. 	 To characterize a broader generalization about the shape of alternatives that yields the effects 
we observed 
5. 	 To speculate about additional cases that might fall under the broader generalization. 

1. The proposal in F&H 

(1) 	

(2) 	

The Universal Density of Measurements (UDM): Measurement Scales that are needed for 
Natural Language Semantics are formally dense (though contextually might be discrete).  

a.  The Intuitive Claim: Scales of height, size, speed, and the like are dense.  
b.  The Radical Claim: All Scales are dense; cardinality in not a concept of NLS. 

1.1. A constraint on Implicatures and only: 

1.1.1. Density as an intuitive property of scales 

THE BASIC EFFECT 

(3)  a.  	 John weighs more than 150 pounds. 
*Implicature: John weighs exactly S(150) pounds. Where S is the successor function  
b. 	 John weighs very little. *He only weighs more than 150. 

UNIVERSAL MODALS CIRCUMVENT THE PROBLEM 

(4)  a.  	 You're required to weigh more than 300 pounds (if you want to participate in this fight). 
Implicature: There is no degree greater than 150, d, s.t. you are required to weigh more than d pounds. 
b. 	 You're only required to weigh more than 150 pounds. 

EXISTENTIAL MODALS DO NOT

 (5) a.  	 You're allowed to weigh more than 150 pounds (and still participate in this fight).  
*Implicature: There is no degree greater than 150, d, s.t. you are allowed to weigh more than d pounds. 
b. 	 *You're only allowed to weigh more than 150 pounds.

1.1.2. Density as a formal property 

THE BASIC EFFECT 

(6)  a. 	 John has more than 3 children. 
*Implicature: John has exactly 4 children. 
b. 	 John has very few children. *He only has more than THREE. 

UNIVERSAL MODALS CIRCUMVENT THE PROBLEM 

(7)  a. 	 You're required to read more than 30 books. 
Implicature: There is no degree greater than 30, d, s.t. you are required to read more than d books. 
b. 	 You're only required to read more than 30F books. 

EXISTENTIAL MODALS DO NOT
 (8) a. 	 You're allowed to smoke more than 30 cigarettes.  
*Implicature: There is no degree greater than 30, d, s.t. you are allowed to smoke more than d cigarettes. 
b. 	 *You're only allowed to smoke more than 30F cigarettes. 

1.2. A Constraint on Questions and Definite Descriptions (Negative Islands) 

1.2.1. Density as an intuitive property of scales 

THE BASIC EFFECT 

(9)  a.  	 *How much does John not weigh? 
What is the successor of John’s weight (the minimal amount d, such that he doesn’t 
weigh d much)?
	*I have the amount of water that you don't. 
cf. I have the amount of water that you do.  

I have an amount of water that you don't. 


b. 

 

UNIVERSAL MODALS CIRCUMVENT THE PROBLEM 

(10) 	

a.  How much are you sure that this vessel won’t weigh? 
b.  	 How much radiation are we not allowed to expose our workers to? 
c. 	 The amount of radiation that we are not allowed to expose our workers to is greater 
than we had thought. 
d.  	 The amount of money that you are sure that this stock will never sell for is quite high. 
(Are you sure that your estimation is correct.)

1.3. The Generalization 

(20) 

	We call ϕ<d,st> an N-open property if: 
∀w,d[(ϕ(d)(w) = 1] Æ ∃d'[(ϕ(d')(w) = 1 & ϕ(d') asymmetrically entails ϕ(d)]. 

(21) 	 Examples of an upward monotone N-open property.  

ϕ = λd. John weighs more than d  

ϕ = λd. John has more than d children 

ϕ is false 

ϕ(d) =0 

ϕ is true 

(22) 	 Examples of a downward-monotone N-open property 
ϕ = λd. John doesn’t weigh d pounds 
ϕ = λd. John have d children 

ϕ is true 

ϕ(d) =0 

ϕ is false 

(23)  Constraint on Interval Maximization (CIM): N-open properties cannot be maximized by 
MAXinf.

  MAXinf (ϕ<α,st>)(w) = the x∈Dα, s.t., ϕ(x)(w) =1 and ∀y(ϕ (y)(w)=1 Æ ϕ(x) entails ϕ(y) 


 

Lexical entries2 

(24)  	

a. [[exh]] (ϕ)(d)(w) ⇔ d = MAXinf(ϕ)(w). 
b. [[ only]] (ϕ)(d)(w) ⇔ d = MAXinf(ϕ)(w), when defined. 
c. [[ ?]](ϕ α,st) = λw:∃d[d= MAXinf(ϕ)(w)].{ϕ (x): x ∈ Dα } 
d. [[the]] (ϕ)(w) = MAXinf (ϕ)(w) 
(von Fintel, Fox, Iatridou) 

2 The lexical entries for only and exh in (24) presuppose a movement theory of association with focus. In the next 
section, I presuppose a Roothian theory of association with focus: only and exh take a proposition p and a set of 
alternatives A (usually the focus value of the “prejacent”). The Roothian statements translate in an obvious way to 
(24)a and b as long as [p=ϕ(d)] & ∀q∈A[∃d [q=ϕ(y)] & ∀d [∃q∈A [q=ϕ(y)]. Under such circumstances, 
onlyRoothian(A)(p) = only(ϕ)(x).

(25) 

	Basic Consequence: If ϕ expresses an N-open monotone property of degrees, then the 
following should be unacceptable.3 
a. *exh (ϕ)(d) 
b. *only (ϕ)(d) 
c. *whd (ϕ) 
d. *the (ϕ) 

(26) 	 Basic Logical facts. 
a. 	 A universal modal can close interval: If ϕ is an N-open monotone property of 
degrees, [λd.☐ ϕ (d)] is not.
Proof: Let the modal base for ☐ in w0 be {w:ϕ(d*)(w)=1}. It is now easy to see that 
MAXinf([λd.☐ ϕ (d)])(w0) = d*. 
b. 	 An existential modal cannot close interval: If ϕ is an N-open monotone property of 
degrees, so is [λd. ◊ ϕ (d)] is not. 
Proof: Assume otherwise, and let MAXinf([λd. ◊ ϕ (d)])(w0) = d*. 
◊ ϕ(d*) is true in w0. Hence, 

There is a world, w* in MBw0(◊), s.t. ϕ(d*)(w*) =1]. Since ϕ is N-open 

There is a degree d**, s.t. [(ϕ(d**)(w*) = 1 & ϕ(d**) asymmetrically entails ϕ(d*)], 

Hence, [◊(ϕ (d**))](w0) =1 and d*≠MAXinf([λd. ◊ ϕ (d)])(w0). 


(27) 	 Consequence for universal modals: A universal modal can close an interval; hence even 
if ϕ  is an N-open monotone property of degrees, the following should be acceptable 
a. exh ([λd.☐ ϕ (d)])(d') 
b. only ([λd.☐ ϕ (d)])(d') 
c. whd ([λd.☐ ϕ (d)])
d. the ([λd.☐ ϕ (d)]) 

(28) 	 Consequence for existential modals: An existential modal cannot close an interval. 
Hence, if ϕ  is an N-open monotone property of degrees, then the following should be 
unacceptable 
a. *exh ([λd.◊ϕ (d)])(d') 
b. *only ([λd.◊ϕ (d)])(d') 
c. *whd ([λd.◊ϕ (d)]) 
d. *the ([λd.◊ ϕ (d)]) 

The fact that the CIM plays an explanatory role in accounting for the status of expressions in 
natural language can be taken as evidence that natural language has N-open properties, i.e. for 
The Intuitive Claim, (2)a.  

The fact that the CIM seems to be at work in all degree constructions (even those that putatively 
make reference to cardinality) constitutes our argument for the universality of the UDM, i.e. for 
The Radical Claim, (2)b.  

3 In Fox (2006), I argued for a contradiction-free meaning of exh and only (weaker than that of Groenendijk and 
Stokhof). These arguments are not in conflict with F&H; in all relevant cases where exhaustification leads to 
contradictions under (24), it would be vacuous under my definition.

2. Evidence of a Missed Generalization 

The same pattern observed in F&H is attested when a sentence p with an implicature ¬q is 
connected with q by disjunction. However, F&H’s account does not extend to such disjunctions.4

THE BASIC EFFECT 

(29) 	

a.  John has 3 or more children. 
*Implicature: John has exactly 4 children. 
b.  John has very few children. *He only has 3 or MORE. 

(30) 	

John talked to Mary or Sue, or both. 
*Implicature: John didn’t talk to both Mary and Sue. 

UNIVERSAL MODALS CIRCUMVENT THE PROBLEM 

(31) 	

a.  You're required to read 30 books or more. 
Implicature: There is no degree greater than 30, d, s.t. you are required to read more than d books. 
b.  You're only required to read 30 books or MORE. 

b'.  You're only required to read 30 or MORE books. 


(32) 	

John is required to talk to Mary or Sue, both. 
Implicature: John is not required to talk to both Mary and Sue. 

EXISTENTIAL MODALS DO NOT
 (33) 	 a.  You're allowed to smoke 30 cigarettes or more.  

*Implicature: There is no degree greater than 30, d, s.t. you are allowed to smoke more than d

cigarettes. 

b.  *You're only allowed to smoke more than 30F cigarettes. 

(34) 	

John is allowed to talk to Mary or Sue, both. 
*Implicature: John is not allowed to talk to both Mary and Sue. 

4 This pattern was pointed out to us by Gennaro Chierchia, Nathan Klindinst, Philippe Schlenker, and Bemjamin 
Spector.

3. Hurford’s Generalization and Symmetric Altenatives5 

Hurford’s Generalization (HG): A or B is infelicitous when B entails A.6 

(35) 

a.  ??John is an American or a Californian.  
b.  ??I was born in France or Paris. 

Hurford used this generalization to argue for a strong meaning for disjunction (ExOR): 

(36) 

I will apply to Cornell or UMASS or to both. 

One can extend this argument to other scalar items (cf. Gazdar 1979): 

(37) 

a.  I will read two books or three. 
b.  I will do some of the homework or all of it. 

(36)' 
 
 

[Exh(I will apply to Cornell orF UMASS)] or [I will apply to Cornell and UMASS]
(p∇q)∨(p∧q) 

Further argument for such a representation (developed together with G. Chierchia):  

(38)  	 It’s either the case that each of the kids did some of the homework or that John did all of it 
and every other kid did just some of it 

Important: In the first disjunct in (38) Exh would have to be below a universal quantifier for 
Hurford’s constraint to be satisfied. This is a good result since the sentence is false/odd if there is a 
kid other than John who did all of the homework. The sentences thus provide independent evidence 
for Hurford’s constraint. 

Computing Implicatures for (36)': 

ALT (36)' includes at least the following and excluding the stronger members leads to a 
contradiction: 

(p∇q) ∨ (p∧q) 
 
 
 
 

(p∧q) 

(p∇q) 

5 Proposed in Spector 2005, with an extension to part of the core paradigm mentioned above (see sections 4 and 5 
below), as well as to sentences with at least (however with no reliance on Hurford’s constraints). I made the 
proposal for the Hurford cases in my (2004) class on implicatures, but I argued for a totally different account for 
 
sentences involving at least, which is closely tied to superlative morphology (and to arguments by Nouwen 2004
that at least has a modal component).

4. Spector 2005 

Extend the Hurford cases to comparatives. (See also Russell in press.) 

(39) Alt(more than 3) = Alt(4 or more) = {more than 4, exactly 4} 

Questions/Problems: 

1.	 Why should we have the alternatives in (39)? 
2.	 Would we still need density to account for the constraints on questions and definite 
descriptions? Are we missing a generalization here? 
3.	 Empirical arguments against an identical account of more than n and n+1 or more 

(34) 	

a.  You are allowed to smoke more than 5 cigarettes. I am luckier, I am allowed to 
smoke more than 6. More specifically, exactly 7. 
b. 	 You are allowed to smoke 6 or more cigarettes. I am luckier, I am allowed to 
smoke 7 or more. #More specifically, exactly 7. 

The oddness of (34)b is the result of “free choice permission” which follows on many 
accounts from the shape of the alternatives (Kratzer and Shimoyama, Alonso-Ovalle, Fox, 
Klindinst). 

(40) 	

a.  You're only required to read more than THREE books. I.e., you're not required to 
read more than 4. To be more precise, you're required to read exactly 4 (i.e, you're 
not allowed to read 5)

b. 	 You're only required to read 4 or MORE books. I.e., you're not required to read 
more than 4. #To be more precise, you're required to read exactly 4 (i.e, you're not 
allowed to read 5) 

Tentative Conclusion: The source of the similar behavior for the cases discussed by F&H, and 
for the Hurford cases is at least partially different. In all cases an exhaustive operator leads to a 
contradiction. The reason for the contradiction, however, could different. In the Hurford case, 
contradiction results from a symmetric set of alternatives. In the other case, it’s the result of the 
UDM. Al least with questions and definite descriptions the UDM is (right now) the only account. 

5. A Broader Generalization 

Are we missing a real generalization. 

Not necessarily! 

Independent evidence for a broader generalization: 

(41)  Every student in this department has to have 3 professors on his committee. 
a. 	 #Mary is the only professor on John’s committee. 
b. 	 Mary is the only professor that John is certain to have on his committee. 
c. 	 #Mary is the only professor that John might have on his committee. 

 

a. 	 #Which professor did John have on his committee?
b. 
	Which professor is John certain to have on his committee? 
c. 	 ??Which professor might John have on his committee? 

Neither Density nor Symmetry is involved in (41). Still, the same generalization seems to hold. 
Clearly, we need something broader. 

Let p be a proposition and A a set of propositions (possibly infinite). We will say that p is merely 
Locally exhaustifiable given A [MLE(p, A)] if every proposition in A can be denied consistently 
with p, but the denial of all alternatives is inconsistent with p.  

∀q∈A[p&¬q is consistent], but p&I{¬q: q∈A} is inconsistent. 
[∀q∈A[(p&¬q) ≠∅], but [p&I{¬q: q∈A}]=∅.7 

[MLE(p, A)] 

(42) 

⇔ 

If MLE(p, A) 

EX(A)(p) is inconsistent, where EX(A)(p) ⇔ [p & ∀q∈A[q → (p ⇒ q)]  


Let p be a proposition and ϕ a property of type 〈α, st〉, s.t. 

7 Taking into account the phenomena discussed in Fox (2006), we would need to strengthen the definition as 
follows: MLE(p,A) ⇔ [∀q∈A[(p&¬q) ≠∅], but [¬∃q∈A, s.t. q∈IE(p,A)].

THE BASIC EFFECT 

Fact #1 


Only(A)(p) and Ex(A)(p) are both contradictory. 


Prediction #1 

a. 	 We should expect Only S to be unacceptable if p is the denotation of S and A is the focus 
value of S. 
b. 	 We should expect S to lack a scalar implicature if p is its denotation and A is the set (of 
denotations) of the relevant alternatives. 

c. 	 We should expect whϕ to be an unacceptable question. 
d. 	 We should expect theϕ to be an unacceptable definite description. 

UNIVERSAL MODALS CIRCUMVENT THE PROBLEM 

Fact #2 

EX((cid:0)A)((cid:0)p) is consistent 

             

(where  (cid:0)A = {(cid:0)p: p∈A)}) 

Proof: by constructing the following modal base 

{w: p(w)=1 & ∃q∈A(q(w)=0)} 

Prediction #2 

a. 	 We should expect Only (cid:0)S  to be acceptable if (cid:0)p is the denotation of S and (cid:0)A is the focus 
value of S. 
b. 	 We should expect (cid:0)S  to have a scalar implicature if p is its denotation and (cid:0)A is the set (of 
denotations) of the relevant alternatives. 
c. 	 We should expect whλx(cid:0)ϕ(x) to be an acceptable question. 
d. 	 We should expect theλx(cid:0)ϕ(x) to be an acceptable question. 

EXISTENTIAL MODALS DO NOT 

Fact #3 

EX(◊A)( ◊p) 
(where  ◊A = {◊p: p∈A)}) 
is inconsistent 
 Proof: Assume otherwise, and let MB be the modal base which satisfies EX(◊A)( ◊p). Since ◊p 
is true, there is w∈MB, s.t. p(w)=1, wp. For each q∈A, such that p ⊄ q, q(wp)=0 since 
[¬◊q](w)=1. But this means that all members of A could be denied consistently, contrary to 
assumption.

d. 	 We should expect theλx◊ϕ(x) to be an unacceptable question. 

6. Other Weak Islands 

Some “weak islands” obey the generalization that we identified, others do not: 

(43) 	

(44) 	

a. *(I know) how you did not [behave t]. 
b. (I know) how you are not allowed to [behave t]. 
c. *(I know) how you are not required to [behave t]. 

a. *(I know) why you did not [behave well t]. 
b. *(I know) why you are not allowed to [behave well t]. 
c. *(I know) how you are not required to [behave well t]. 

(45) 	 Hypothesis: All Questions that obey negative islands with obviation by universal 
quantification (above negation or existential quantification below negation) share the 
following property: ∀xα[MLE (ϕ〈α, st〉, (x), {ϕ(y): y∈Dα}], where ϕ is the question 
property. 

Speculation about (43) (far from an account): The domain of manners is not closed under sum 
formation (Szabolcsi and Zwarts).  

Possible prediction (see Fodor 1972, Gajewski 2005, and Szabolcsi and Haddican 2004):  

(46) 	

(47) 	

a.  He didn’t talk to John and Bill. 
b. 	 He didn’t behave sensibly and kindly.  

(neg > &; & > neg) 
(neg > &; (?)& > neg) 

a.  He  doesn’t believe that I talked to John and Bill.  
(neg > &; & > neg) 
b. 	 He  doesn’t believe that I behaved sensibly and kindly. 

 (*)&  >
 >
(neg
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 &;
 neg)


 (48) 	 a.  You will be punished twice because he doesn’t believe that you did the reading and 

the homework. 
b. 	 (#)You will be doubly fined because he doesn’t believe that you drove slowly and 
carefully.
