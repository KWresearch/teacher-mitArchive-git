Accommodation – the proviso problem  


Suppose we know nothing, what will we accommodate when hearing the following?


(1) 

If John arrived late, his daughter was sick. 


We would probably add ( 2) to the CG.  


(2) 

John has a daughter. 


But, why? After all, we’ve learned that the presupposition of ( 1) is ( 3). 


(3) 	

If John arrived late, he has a daughter. 


Beaver (2001) and von Fintel (2006) [henceforth BvF]: this is not necessarily a problem. 

Basic idea, when H hears S’s utterance of ( 1), H must take ( 3) to be part of CG. If ( 2) is 
part of CG, so is ( 3). Hence assuming that ( 2) is part of CG is a way to satisfy the 
presuppositional requirements of (1).  

But why ( 2) rather than the minimal ( 3). BvF: If the belief in ( 3) is forced upon us, it 
would be more reasonable to believe in ( 2) than not to.

  Acc: someone solved the problem 

Beaver (2006) [Comments on von Fintel (2006)] 

a.  	 Bart Geurts’ strongest argument against conditional presuppositions depends on a 
reasonable (though unstated) requirement on the relation between these two theories: if 
two sentences presuppose exactly the same propositions, we should expect the 
accommodation theory to predict the same contextual adjustments. 
b.  	 Accordingly, Geurts found a recipe for creating pairs of sentences that apparently have 
the same presuppositions, but lead to different accommodation.

c.  	

I am suggesting that Geurts’ recipe creates pairs of sentences with slightly different 
presuppositions. S2, i.e.“X factive-verb if A then P,” presupposes relevance of A to P, but 
this is not presupposed by S1 “if A then BP.”

a.  If the problem was difficult, it wasn’t John who solved it. 
Hey wait a minute, I didn’t know that someone solved the problem.  
b.  The president’s daughter is coming to town.   
Hey wait a minute, I didn’t know that the president had a daughter.  
#Hey wait a minute, I didn’t know that the president had a white daughter.
