X1 , X2  are  uniformly  distributed  between  0  and  a.  Let  G(a)  ∗  E [max(x 1 , x2 )3 ]  and  consider

G(a + �)  when X1 , X2  are  uniformly  distributed  between  0  and  a + �,  where  �  is  very  small.


Suppose  a < X2  ≈  a +  �  and  0  ≈  X1  ≈  a.  Then  we  know  that  max(x1 , x2 ) =  x2 .  There­ 

fore  E [max(x1 , x2 )3 ]  ∗  E [x2
3 ].  Since  X1  and  X2  are  independent,  G(a + �)  for  this  case  can  be

computed  as  follows:


G(a + �) = E [max(x1 , x2 )3 ] = E [x2
3 ] =

a 
where  fX2 (x2 )  is  the  probability  density  function  of  X2 .  Because  X2  is  uniformly  distributed  over 
1 .  Thus,

By  symmetry  we  have  G(a + �) � a3  as  � � 0  when  0 ≈ X2  ≈ a  and  a < X1  ≈ a + �. 

Finally, we  do not have  to  compute G(a + �)  for  the  case where a < X 1  ≈ a + � and a < X2  ≈ a + � 
because  the  associated  probability  is  negligible.

If  � � 0,  we  have  the  following  diﬀerential  equation: 

+ 2a 2  . 

2G(a) 
G∩ (a) = − 
a 
Seeing  the  2a2  term,  a  “judicious”  guess  for  the  form of G(a)  is B a 3  (keeping  in mind that G(0)=0 
and  therefore  there  is  no  constant  term  in  G(a)).  Assuming  G(a) =  B a 3  we  have  G∩ (a) = 3B a2 . 
Plugging  these  values  into  our  diﬀerential  equation  gives  us: 
3B a2  = −2B a2  + 2a2 
→ 5B  = 2 
→ B  =  2

This  gives  us  the  following  solution:

(Bjarnad´ottir,  2003) 
Let assume v4  is at some distance k  from the given point, with out loss of generality, we can assume 
k  =  1  (then  we  do  not  have  to  carry  k  through  our  calculations).  Then  we  know  that  there  are 
three  other  vehicles  inside  a  circle  of  radius  1,  which  are  uniformly  distributed  over  the  area  of  the 
circle. 

Let  A  be  the  event  that  v4  >  4v1  and  let  B  be  the  event  that  v4  >  2v2 .  We  want  to  ﬁnd  the 
joint  probability  of  these  events,  that  is  P (A � B ) = P (A) ∩ P (B |A). 

1 .  The  compliment 
P(A)  is  the  probability  that  at  least  one  vechicle  is  within  a  circle  of  radius  4

of  A  is  the  event  that  no  vehicle  is  within  radius  4

(Bjarnad´ottir,  2003) 
(i)  When  considering  the  diﬀerent  probabilities  for  Mendel  of  entering  in  intervals  of  diﬀerent 
4  =  4  chance of entering 
lengths, we need to  take  into account  random  incidence:  Mendel has 
4+5+6 
15 
5
6
in  an  interval  of  length  4,  15  of  entering  in  an  interval  of  length  5  and  15  of  entering  in  an  interval 
of  length  6.  Given  the  Mendel  enters  in  an  interval  of  a  certain  length,  his  arrival  is  uniformly 
distributed  over  that  interval.  We  can  therefore  compute  the  probability  that  he  waits  between  4 
and  5  minutes  for  the  next  train  as  follows: 

1  +  15  ∩  6
6 
1 
5
4
P(Mendel  waiting  between  4  and  5  minutes)=  15  ∩ 0 +  15  ∩  5

2
15 = 

(ii)  If the Lemon Line  became  less  variable  and all  intervals  between  trains were  exactly  5 minutes, 
the  probability  would  go  from  2  to  1 ,  since Mendel  would  always  arrive  in  an  interval  of  length  5 
15 
5 
and  therefore  the  chance  to  wait  between  4  and  5  minutes  is  always  1/5. 

Intuitively,  why  does  the  answer move  in  that  direction?  (Barnett,  2003)

We  see  in  the  ﬁrst  part  of  the  problem  that  the  chance  of  waiting  between  4  and  5  minutes  is

higher  (20%)  given  an  interval  of  length  5  than  either  one  of  length  4  (0%)  or  of  length  6  (16.7%).

Thus,  if  intervals  of  lengths  4  and  6  disappear  in  favor  of  5’s,  the  chance  of  waiting  between  4  and

5  minutes  must  go  up.  (The  average  wait  goes  down  under  the  change,  because  the  possibility  of

waiting  more  than  5  minutes  evaporates.)

The  small  factory  has  3 machines,  therefore  the  total  population  is  three.  Our Birth-and-death 
chain  has  therefore  only  a  4  states,  that  is  all  machines  can  be  running,  one  can  be  broken  down, 
two  can  be  broken  down  or  all  can  be  broken  down.  The  following  picture  shows  our  queueing 
system.
