(a)  One  is  tempted  to  say  yes  by  setting  ρ =  N µ  =  2×2  =  2 . But  λ = 2  is  not  the  rate  at  which 
customers  are  accepted  into  the  system  because  we  have  a  loss  system.  Thus  the  answer  is 
no,  and  we  must  derive  the  correct  ﬁgure.  We  can  use  the  following  aggregate  birth-death 
process  (state  transition  diagram  for  an  M/M/2  queueing  system  with  no  waiting  space)  to 
compute  the  workloads:

The  balance  equations  and  the  normalization  equation  are 

2P0  = 2P1 
2P1  = 4P2 
P0  + P1  + P2  = 1 

Solving  the  equations,  we  obtain

(c)  The mean  travel  time  to  a  random  served  customer,  T ,  is  obtained  by 

¯T = f11 T1 (sector  1) + f22 T2 (sector  2) + f12 T1 (sector  2) + f21 T2 (sector  1) . 

Since  the  travel  speed  is  constant,  let  us  ﬁrst  compute  the mean  travel  distance  to  a  random 
¯
customer,  D .


¯
D = f11 D1 (sector  1) + f22 D2 (sector  2) + f12 D1 (sector  2) + f21 D2 (sector  1) . 

Using  the  knowledge  of Chapter  3,  we  have

Hence  the  mean  travel  time  to  a  random  served  customer  is  T =

hr = 3.0  sec.  This

means  that  changes  in  total  service  time  due  to  changes  in  travel  time  are  insigniﬁcant  and 
¯
therefore  the Markov  models  applies.  Note  that  another  way  to  compute  D  is 

D¯ = 

2 ( 2 ) +  2 ( 1  ·  4  +  1  ·  2 )
P00 ( 2 ) + (P01  + P10 )( 1  ·  2  +  1  ·  4 )

In  fact,  we  can  obtain  this  form  by  simplifying  the  formula  for  D  above.  However,  think 
¯
about  how  we  can  obtain  this  directly  without  using  the  formula  for D  above. 

(d)  Consider  a  long  time  interval  T .  In  the  steady  state,  the  average  total  number  of customers 
served  is  λT (1 − P11 ).  Server  1  is  sent  to  sector  2  in  the  following  cases: 

(1)  A  customer  arrives  from  sector  2,  server  2  is  busy,  and  server  1  is  idle. 

(2)  A  customer  arrives  from  buﬀer  zone  2,  server  2  is  idle  outside  buﬀer  zone  2,  and  server 
1  is  idle  inside  buﬀer  zone  1. 

The average  number of customers  served by  the ﬁrst case  is  λ2T P10 .  To compute  the average 
number of customers served by the second case,  let us ﬁrst ﬁnd the probability that server 2 is 
idle outside buﬀer zone 2 and server 1 is idle inside buﬀer zone 1.  Using geometrical probability 
and the independence of the two servers, we know that the probability  is ( 3
4 )( 1
4 )P00 . Since the 
arrival  rate  from  buﬀer  zone  2  is  λ
2 ,  the  average  number  of customers  served  by  the  second

4 
T ( 3
4 )( 1
case  during  time  interval  T  is  λ
4 )P00 . 
2 
4 
Using  these  quantities,  we  obtain  the  fraction  of  dispatch  assignments  that  send  server  1  to 
sector  2  under  the  new  dispatch  policy  as  follows: 

f (cid:2)

= 0.1367 .


f (cid:2) 
12  is  greater  than  f12  = 0.125  as  expected.  Note  that  the  state  transition  diagram  does  not 
change  under  the  new  dispatch  policy  (Why?  Invoke  symmetries). 

(e)  Let T1  be the travel  time of server  1 to a random customer  and T2  be the travel  time of server 
2  to  a  random  customer.  Similar  to  (c),  the  mean  travel  time  to  a  random  customer  under 
the  new  dispatch  policy  is  given  by 

T¯(cid:2)  =f (cid:2) 
11 E [T1  | server  1  has  been  dispatched  into  sector  1] + 
f (cid:2) 
E [T2  | server  2  has  been  dispatched  into  sector  2] + 
22 
f (cid:2) 
E [T1  | server  1  has  been  dispatched  into  sector  2] + 
12 
f (cid:2) 
21 E [T2  | server  2  has  been  dispatched  into  sector  1] .

But  the  existence  of buﬀer  zones  complicates  matters.  One  way  to  handle  this  is  as  follows: 

•  Break  up  f (cid:2) 
(and  f (cid:2) 
21 )  into  its  two  constituent  parts  and  compute  a  conditional  mean 
12 
travel  distance  for  each 
•  Do  the same for  f (cid:2) 
11  and  f (cid:2) 
22 .
•  Combine  the  results  for  the  ﬁnal  answer. 

The  numerical  value  is  less  than  that  of part  (c),  because  we  tend  to  dispatch  the  closer 
available  server  (not  always  successful,  though). 

Although  it is not required in the question,  let us compute T¯(cid:2)  exactly.  We deﬁne the following 
events: 

•  CB:  A  customer  is  in  a  buﬀer  zone. 

•  SAB:  Server  of the  adjacent  sector  is  in  its  buﬀer  zone. 

•  SHB:  Server  of home  sector  is  in  its  buﬀer  zone. 

Let  us  denote  by  CBc  the  complement  event  of CB,  which  means  that  a  customer  is  not 
in  a  buﬀer  zone.  Other  complement  events  are  deﬁned  similarly.  Then  in  the  state  where 
both  servers  are  available,  with  probability  P00 ,  we  have  eight  mutually  exclusive,  collective 
exhaustive events:  (CB ∩ SAB ∩ SHB),  (CBc ∩ SAB ∩ SHB),  (CB ∩ SABc ∩ SHB),  (CB ∩ SAB ∩ 
SHBc ),  (CBc ∩ SABc ∩ SHB),  (CBc ∩ SAB ∩ SHBc),  (CB ∩ SABc ∩ SHBc ),  and  (CBc ∩ SABc ∩ 
SHBc ). 

Let  us  abbreviate  these  events  in  binary,  for  example,  (CB ∩ SAB ∩ SHB)  =  (111),  (CBc  ∩ 
SAB ∩ SHBc ) =  (010),  etc.  Then  we  can  write,  using  the  techniques  from  Chapter  3  for  the 
conditional  mean  travel  distances,

Plugging  all  numbers,  we  obtain  D¯ (cid:2)  =  1271  = 0.82747  < D¯ =  5  = 0.83333.  The  mean  travel 
1536	
6 
D¯�	
¯(cid:2) 
¯
time  to  a  random customer  is  T =  1000  = 2.9789  sec < T = 3  sec.  So, we do get  an  expected 
improvement  in  mean  response  distance  (time),  but  not  a  large  one.  The  fact  that  we  have 
more  inter-sector  dispatches  does  not  necessarily  mean  that  mean  response  distance  (time) 
will  increase. 

(f )  First, do not use Carter, Chaiken,  and  Ignall  formula  (Equation  (5.18)).  It only applies when 
¯
server  locations  are  ﬁxed.  The  best  option  is  to  compute  T (x),  where  x is  the  location  of 
a  boundary  line,  and  use  calculus  to  ﬁnd  an  optimal  value  of  x (as  we  did  in  the  2-server 
numerical example  in the book and in class).  The problem with Equation (5.18)  is that T1 (B ) 
and  T2 (B )  depend  on  the  location  of the  boundary  line  separating  sectors  1  and  2.  This  is 
because  each  available  server  patrols  uniformly  its  sector  while  it  is  idle  and  thus  its  travel 
time  in  B depends  on  sector  design. 

Problem  2  (Odoni,  2001) 

(a)  There  are  several  possible  ways  to  deﬁne  the  system’s  state.	 All  of them  lead  to  essentially 
the  same  state-transition  diagram.  One  possible  deﬁnition  of state  is  (i, j ),  where 

•  i is  the  number  of people  being  serviced  by  or  waiting  for  Vincent, 

•  j is  the  state  of Al  (either  idle  or  busy). 

Then  we  have  the  following  state-transition  diagram:

(b)  Let  N  denote  the  number  of customers  served  by  Vincent  per  hour.  All  customers  who,  on 
arrival, ﬁnd the system  in  state  (0, 0),  (1, 0),  (0, 1),  or  (1, 1)  are served by Vincent.  Therefore, 

E [N ] = λ(P00  + P10  + P01  + P11 ) . 

From  the  service  rate  point  of view,  we  can  also  write  E [N ]  as  follows: 

E [N ] = µ1 (P10  + P20  + P11  + P21 ) . 

This  follows  from  the  following  balance  equations: 

λP00  + λP01  = µ1P10  + µ1P11 
λP10  + λP11  = µ1P20  + µ1P21 

(c)  Since  we  have  just  observed  a  customer  enter  the  barbershop  and  sit  Al’s  chair,  the  system 
is  now  in  state  (2, 1).  If one  of the  following  two  events  happens,  the  next  customer  who will 
enter  the  shop  will  be  served  by  Vincent: 

(1)  Vincent  ﬁnishes  his  service  for  the  customer  in  his  barber  chair  before  Al  does. 

(2)  Al  ﬁnishes  his  service	 and  then  Vincent  ﬁnishes  his  service  before  the  next  customer 
arrives.

Problem  3  (Odoni,  2001) 

(a)  There are many possible minimum spanning trees,  some better  than others  for getting a good 
TSP  solution.  The  following  is  one  good  minimum  spanning  tree,  where  the  dashed  lines 
indicate  a matching  of odd-degree nodes, A − D  and H − M .  This  results  in  a  tour  (skipping 
nodes  already  visited,  if possible)  that  looks  like 

{A,  B , D ,  E ,  F , G,  H,  G, M ,  L,  K,  J,  I ,  C,  A} . 

The  only  edge  covered  twice  in  this  tour  is  (G, H ).
