d) 

The chance that a passenger arriving at the taxi stand actually leaves it in a cab is: 
2 π0 , 0  = 3
π0 ,1  + 1

The chance that a taxi stops is: 
π0 , 0  + π1, 0  = 3
5 
This is the same as b) because  λT 
= λP   which implies that taxis and customers 
reach the stand at the same rate.  Because, over the long run, the number of cabs 
that leave with customers is the same as the number of customers who leave in 
cabs, the FRACTION of  arrivals that leave happily must be the same for taxis 
and customers. 

To find the average waiting time for passengers who leave by taxi, determine the 
expected waiting time for passengers and divide by the chance that an arriving 
passenger leaves by taxi:

e) 

For two passengers in a row to leave by taxi and have zero waits, we must be in 
state (0,1) when the first passenger arrives.    Then, another taxi must arrive 
before the next passenger, in which case the taxi will wait for the passenger and 
  
the passenger’s wait will be zero.   The chance of the first of these events is 2/5; 
the conditional probability of the second given the first is 1/2 (because lambda is 
the same for taxis and passengers) :

Note: Dx (the distance from B to demand along x axis) is not independent of Dy 
x and σD 
(the distance along y axis), therefore, we cannot simply add σD
