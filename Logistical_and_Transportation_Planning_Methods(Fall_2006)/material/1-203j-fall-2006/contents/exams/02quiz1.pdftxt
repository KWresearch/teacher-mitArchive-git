Problem #1.  50 points 
 
(a) [25 points] Consider the square that is 1.0 km on a side shown in Figure 1.  Two points X1 
and X2 are uniformly independently located on the perimeter of the square.  The location X1 
represents a police car and X2 an emergency incident.  Travel can only occur on the perimeter 
of the square.  That is, there are no roads internal to the square. 
 

(i) Find the probability density function (pdf) for the travel distance between X1 and 
X2, assuming the police car follows a shortest path on the perimeter of the square and 
can make U-turns. 
 
(ii) Repeat part (a)(i) assuming that the police car cannot make U-turns and must 
travel only in the one direction that it is currently traveling to reach point X2. 
 

 
(b) [25 points] Now consider the more complex square that is 2.0 km on a side shown in 
Figure 2. This figure depicts four city blocks, each 1.0 km on a side.  Two points X1 and X2 
are uniformly independently located on the 12 kilometers of streets of Figure 2 (i.e. they can 
occur only along the lines drawn in Figure 2, and NOT in the interiors of the city blocks).  
Again the location X1 represents a police car and X2 an emergency incident.  Travel can only 
occur on the streets of Figure 2.  We assume that the police car can make U-turns anywhere 
and that the police car follows a shortest path.  We are given the conditional information that 
the police car, at the moment of dispatch to an emergency incident, is located randomly (i.e., 
according to a uniform pdf) on the interior link shown.  Find and carefully sketch the 
conditional pdf for the travel distance from the police car, conditionally located on the link 
shown, to the emergency incident.  (Hint:  Systematically use conditioning and explain your 
work.)

Problem #2.  50 points 
 
 
Two kinds of customers arrive at a single-server queuing system, under independent 
 
Poisson processes with rates λ1 and λ2.   Service times for all customers are exponential with 
parameter µ.      Initially, there is no priority scheme for handling customers.  Assume that µ 
is large enough that the queuing system is stable. 
 
 
(i) 

 
(9 points) If the server has just finished an idle period, what is the average time until 
he is next idle? 

 
(ii) 

(9 points) What is the probability that the server will handle exactly one customer 
during a busy period? 

 
 
  Now, suppose that type-1 customers get non-preemptive priority over type-2 customers.   
Under that arrangement, no type-2 customer starts service when there are any type-1 
customers present.    However, when a type-2 customer enters service, she cannot be 
interrupted before completion even if a type-1 customer arrives. 
 
(iii) 

(9 points) Under this arrangement, what fraction of the time does the server spend 
busy? 

 
(iv) 
(9 points) What is the server’s average busy period under this arrangement?    (HINT:  
It doesn’t matter whether the busy period starts with a type 1 or type 2 customer.)  Explain. 
 
(v) 
(14 points) Suppose that Mendel is a type-1 customer, and let random variable z be the 
amount of time he spends in the system while a type-2 customer is being served.     Find:
