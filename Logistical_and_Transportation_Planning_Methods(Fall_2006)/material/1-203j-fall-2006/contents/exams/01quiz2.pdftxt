Problem #1.  Two Server Hypercube Problem  (50 points) 

Consider a 1-mile-by-2-mile homogeneous service region served by two mobile patrolling 
servers as shown in Figure 1.  Here are the assumptions of the model: 

1. 	 Customer locations are uniformly independently located over the entire rectangular service 
region. 
2. 	 Over time, customers arrive as a homogeneous Poisson process at aggregate rate �=2 customers 
per hour. 
3. 	 While not busy serving customers, each server patrols its sector (sector 1 or 2, respectively).  
Under this circumstance, the server’s location at  a random time is uniformly distributed over its 
sector.  Each sector is a one-mile-by-one-mile square. 
4. 	 Travel distance is right-angle (“Manh attan metric ”), with speed  equal to 1000 mi./hr.  
5. 	 The on-scene time to serve a customer is a random variable having a negative exponential 
probability density function with mean equal to 30 minutes.  Upon completion of service of a 
customer at the scene, the server resumes random patrol of his/her sector. 
6. 	 This is the dispatch strategy: For a customer from sector i (i=1,2), dispatch server i if available. 
Else dispatch the other server if available; Else the customer is lost forever.

(a)  Is it true that the workload (fraction of time busy) of each server is equal to 1/2?  If true, briefly 
explain why.  If false, derive the correct figure. 
(b)  Determine the fraction of dispatches that take server 1 to sector 2. 
(c)  Determine the mean travel time to a random served customer. 

Now consider the situation as shown in Figure 2.  Assumptions 1 through 5 above remain 
correct.  However, Assumption 6 is altered as follows:  
Case in which both servers are available: For a customer from a part of sector i not in 
Buffer Zone i, dispatch server i.  For a customer in Buffer Zone i, dispatch the other 
server only if that other server is within its own buffer zone and server i is not within its 
buffer zone; else dispatch server i to that customer. 
Case in which only one server is available: Dispatch that server. 
Else the customer is lost forever. 

(d)  Under this new dispatch policy, determine the fraction of dispatch assignments that send server 1 
to sector 2. 
(e)  Without doing the detailed calculations, describe briefly how you would compute the mean 
travel time.  How would the magnitude of the numerical answer compare to that of part (c)? 
(f)  Suppose under the simpler dispatch policy #1 above, we find that the workload of Sector #1 is 
twice the workload of Sector 2, while � remains the same at � = 2.  Without doing the 
calculations, briefly explain how you would find an optimal boundary line separating Sectors 1 
and 2, where  ‘ optimal ’  means minimizing mean travel time.  Would it be to the left of right of x 
= 0?  Why?

Problem 2: Markov Queues  (25 points) 

Vincent ’ s barbershop is very modest in size.  It consists of two barber’ s chairs where 
Vincent and his newly-hired other barber Al serve customers and one other chair for 
waiting customers.  Prospective customers arrive at the barbershop in a Poisson manner 
at the rate of � per hour.  Those who find the barbershop full (both barber’ s chairs and the 
waiting chair are all occupied) go to other barbershops and are lost forever.  Those who 
see an empty chair (barber’ s or otherwise) will walk into the store and will eventually be 
served by Vincent or Al. 

It takes Vincent 1/�� hours, on average, to complete service to a customer while Al takes 
1/�� hours, on average, per customer.  The pdf’ s for both Al ’ s and Vincent’ s service 
times are negative exponential.  

The following interesting behavior of barbershop customers has been observed.  Because 
Vincent is considered a great barber and Al is not very popular, any customer who finds 
both Al and Vincent idle will immediately choose to sit at Vincent ’ s chair.  Moreover, 
customers who upon arriving at the barbershop find Vincent busy and Al idle and the 
waiting chair empty, will choose to sit at the waiting chair and wait for Vincent, rather 
than be served immediately by Al.  Customers occupying the waiting chair will wait as 
long as it takes to be served eventually by Vincent.  In fact, the only customers that poor 
Al serves are those who find Vincent busy and the waiting chair occupied.  

All questions below refer to steady-state conditions. 

(a)  Carefully draw a state-transition diagram for this queuing system.  	DO NOT 
WRITE THE CORRESPONDING EQUATIONS OR SOLVE FOR THE 
STEADY STATE PROBABILITIES. 

(b)  How many customers per hour will Vincent actually serve on average in this 
situation?  Your answer should be in terms of ��and/or��� and/or �� and the 
steady-state probabilities of some of the states you have defined.  (Assume you 
know these steady-state probabilities and use symbols for them, such as Px.) 

(c)  We have just observed a customer enter the barbershop and sit in Al ’ s chair (to 
receive a haircut from Al).  What is the probability that the next customer who 
will enter the shop will have his hair cut by Vincent? 

Problem 3:  Networks  (25 points) 

We wish to find a tour that visits every node of the network shown in Figure 3 at least 
once, starting and ending at node A.

(a)  Find such a tour by (i) applying the Christofides heuristic and (ii) improving on 
the resulting tour by not visiting again, unless you have to, nodes that have 
already been visited.  Give your answer either in the form of a clear sketch or in 
the form of a listing of the sequence in which nodes are visited in the tour.  The 
list should look like {A,  “ node name ” , “ node name” , …
., A}. 

(b) With the insight gained from part (a) try to find an optimal solution to the TSP.  
Non-optimal, but reasonably good solutions will be given partial credit.
