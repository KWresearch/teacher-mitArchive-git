Problem 1 (30 points): Queuing in Pairs 

[Note:  This problem is a variation of Problem # 4 in Quiz 1.  Several things have, 
however, changed in this problem:  Type 2 customers are described differently; the 
queueing capacity of the system is 2 instead of 0; and some of the questions are 
different, as well.] 

Consider a queueing system with two parallel servers and two spaces for queueing (in 
addition to the two servers). 

This facility serves two types of customers.  Type 1 customers are of the conventional 
type.  They arrive in a Poisson manner at a rate of λ1  per minute.  The service time to 
these customers has a negative exponential pdf with a rate of µ1  per minute for each 
server.  Any arriving Type 1 customers who find the system full (i.e., 4 customers in the 
system) are lost. 

Type 2 customers are unusual.  They, too, arrive in a Poisson manner at a rate of λ2  per 
minute, but they arrive IN PAIRS.  [Think of a restaurant, where some of the customers 
(Type 1) arrive individually, and others (Type 2) arrive in pairs.]  Moreover, when 
service to each one of these pairs begins, the pair occupies simultaneously TWO servers 
(i.e., both of the servers).  The servers work together on each of these Type 2 pairs.  The 
service time to the pair has a negative exponential pdf with a rate of µ2  per minute.  (Note 
that this means that the two servers begin and end service to each Type 2 pair 
simultaneously and, together, can serve µ2  Type 2 pairs per minute if working 
continuously on Type 2 pairs.)  Type 2 customers who do not find at least TWO available 
spaces upon arrival are lost. 

[Please note:  A Type 2 pair cannot occupy the servers, unless both servers are available.  
Thus, in the case where one Type 1 customer is in service and the only customers waiting 
are one Type 2 pair, the Type 2 pair must still wait in queue and the second server 
remains idle.] 

(a)  (20 points) Please draw carefully a state transition diagram that describes this 
queueing system.  Please make sure to define clearly the states of the system. 

[Note:  You can answer part (b) without answering part (a); but, it will be easier to 
answer (b), if you have answered (a).] 

(b) (10 points) Suppose that there are currently four Type 1 customers in the system.  
(Obviously, two of them are receiving service and the other two are in queue.)  
Write an expression for the probability that exactly 3 state transitions later, there 
will be exactly two Type 1 customers and one Type 2 pair in the system.  Your 
expression should be solely in terms of λ1, µ1, λ2  and µ2. [A state transition takes 
place whenever there is a new actual arrival (not a lost arrival) to the system or 
whenever there is a service completion.  The arrival of a new Type 2 pair counts 
as one transition and so does the completion of a service to a Type 2 pair.]

Problem 2 (28 points): Dial-a-Ride 

[Hint:  This problem’s two parts can be answered independently.  The questions are 
not difficult.] 

The single-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (DARP) in a Euclidean metric can be described as 
follows:  Consider a vehicle, located at point 0.  The vehicle has to serve (pick up and 
deliver) n customers and return to point 0 by covering as little distance as possible.  
Customer i (i = 1, 2, …, n) goes from a known origin (labeled node +i) to a known 
destination (node –i).  The distances between any pair (i, j) of the (2n + 1) points of this 
problem (i, j = -n, …, -1, 0, +1, +2, …, +n) are known.  There are no vehicle capacity 
constraints. 

Consider then the following simple heuristic for solving DARP: 

Step 1:  Without distinguishing origins from destinations, use the Christofides heuristic 
to construct a Traveling Salesman tour T0 through the (2n + 1) points of the problem.  In 
completing the heuristic, we make sure not to visit any point twice. (Please note: At the 
conclusion of this step, we have a tour, T0, that visits each of the 2n customer-related 
points exactly once before returning to point 0.  However, some customer destinations 
may be visited before the corresponding origins.  An example of T0 for a 3-customer 
problem is shown in Figure 2a.) 

Step 2:  Starting from node 0, move on T0 in some direction (say clockwise) until all 
nodes are visited.  While doing this, skip any node that has been previously visited and 
any destination whose origin has not been previously visited.  Call this DARP tour T1. 
(An example of T1 is shown in Figure 2b and it corresponds to the example for T0 shown 
in Figure 2a.) 

(a) (16 points) Argue in a few statements that  

L(T1 ) 
L(DARP) 

< 3  ,

where L(T1) is the length of T1 and L(DARP) is the length of the optimal DARP  tour. 
Please explain your reasoning briefly but clearly. 

(b) (12 points) Suppose that after completing Step 2 of the above algorithm, one decided 
to use a 2-exchange heuristic in order to improve the solution.  Specifically, assume that 
one takes T1 and tries to replace repeatedly 2 edges of T1 with 2 other edges which were 
not previously in T1.  [This process is illustrated in Figure 2c for a traveling salesman 
problem where edges (5, 6) and (1, 7) in the tour on the left are replaced by (5, 7) and 
(1, 6) in the tour on the right.]  Please discuss briefly, possibly with a simple example, 
how the precedence constraints in the DARP complicate the application of the 2-
exchange heuristic to the DARP. [Hint: Tour T1 satisfies all precedence constraints, i.e., 
customer origins are visited before their destinations.  Could this be a problem with the 
exchange?]

Problem 3 (42 points): Locating Facilities for Condo Complexes in a small town 

Consider the 5 node network shown bellow. The nodes in condo city represent condo 
complexes, and the weights on each node represent the number of families living in each 
complex (thus the node weights must all be integral), while the arcs represent the distance 
between the complexes.   

Thus A,3: Node A with weight 3

1. 	 (5 Points) We are trying to locate a mail facility for the town.  Find an optimal 
location of the mail facility such that the total weighted travel distance from the 
complexes to the facility is minimized. 

2. 	 (5 Points) What is the minimum number of additional families that must move 
into complex E in order to make E an optimal location for the mail facility? 
Please explain your answer briefly.

3. 	 (9 Points) Assume we never built the mail facility in part 1.  Assume also that we 
now wish to house 4 additional families somewhere on this network, all at one 
point.  All 4 of these families are physically challenged and need to be located at 
an optimal point on the network, i.e., a point that would coincide with the mail 
facility.  The obvious answer is, of course, to locate these 4 families at the 
location you identified in response to Part 1 of this problem.  Unfortunately, this 
location happens to be the only point on the entire network where no additional 
families (beyond the ones originally in the complexes) can be located.  With the 
exception of this restriction, there are two types of places where these four 
families can be located: either at an existing complex (e.g., if we located the four 
families at node A, the weight of A would be increased to 7), or at a point on 
some arc of the network (i.e., by building a new complex F on some arc with 
weight 4). Identify on the network ALL locations (nodes and points along arcs) 
where we can locate this complex; such that an optimal location for the mail 
facility will indeed co-incide with the complex where the four additional families 
will be housed. 

4. 	 (5 Points) Return to the original network of Part 1.   Now 50 additional families 
 
would like to move into the town. However, currently the complex where you 
located the mail station in Part 1 is filled to capacity.  However, the rest of the 
complexes have infinite capacity.  Is it possible to allocate these additional 50 
families in the remaining 4 complexes in such a way that the optimal location of 
the mail center is not changed?  If so state one way this can be done (i.e., how 
many additional families should move into each complex); if not, give a short 
proof of why not. 

Now let us only consider Complexes A, D and E, and the two arcs that connect them 
(each with length equal to 1 mile).  In other words the “network” consists only of nodes 
 
A, D and E and of the arcs (A, D) and (D,E).  Let the number of families living in each 
complex be as follows: A = a, D = d and E = e. We are interested in locating a private 
warehouse with one delivery truck somewhere on this route. Assume the following: 

• 	 The weights are proportional to the number of families at each node (i.e.,. the 
fraction of calls for deliveries arising from node A is a/(a+d+e). 

• 	 Once the facility is located, it serves all three complexes and calls are handled in a 
FIFO order, one at a time. 

• 	 The delivery truck travels to each delivery point at speed v = 1 mile per hour and 
returns to the facility at speed v=1 mile per hour. 

• 	 The delivery truck stays at the delivery point for a length of time which is 
exponentially distributed with a mean of 1 hour, i.e.,  f T  (t ) = 1 ⋅ e −1⋅t  for
t ≥ 0. 

Our goal in each part is to find the location that minimizes the expected total response 
time.  Total response time is defined as the sum of (i) the waiting time until the truck is

dispatched and (ii) the service time, i.e. the time needed for the truck to travel to the 
delivery point, spend the required time at the delivery point and then travel back to the 
facility.   

• 	 For Part 5, let the total rate of calls for deliveries be very small, i.e., λ = 0+ calls 
per hour. 

5. (5 Points) If a = e and d = 0, is it true that every point on the network is an 
optimal location for the facility?   

•  For parts 6 and 7, let the total rate of calls for deliveries is λ = .04 calls per hour. 

6. (5 Points) .If a = e = 4 and d = 5, where is the optimal location for the facility to 
minimize expected response time? 

7. (8 Points) If a = 3, e = 0 and d = 8 and we have located the facility at 0.5 miles 
from A, what is the expected total response time?  Please state your answer in 
terms of units of distance away from complex A (for example, the facility is 
located at x = 0.5.)
