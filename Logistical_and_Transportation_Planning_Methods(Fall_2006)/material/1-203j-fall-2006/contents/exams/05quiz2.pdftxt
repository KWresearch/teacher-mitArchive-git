Problem 1 (36 points) 

In the tree network shown below, demands are generated uniformly along the edges of 
the network in a Poisson manner at the rate of λ per unit of time. (Think of the edges as 
city streets, with houses located along the streets.)   
(a)  (9 points) Find a solution to the 3-absolute-center problem on this network, i.e., 
locate three facilities in a way that minimizes the maximum distance between any 
demand and its nearest facility.  What is the maximum distance associated with 
your solution? (Any answer that finds the correct maximum distance will receive 
full credit.) 
(b)  (9 points) Find a solution to the 4-absolute-center problem on this network.  	What 
is the maximum distance associated with your solution? (Any answer that finds 
the correct maximum distance will receive full credit.) 
Suppose now that we wish to locate a station for a single ambulance on this network in a 
way that minimizes expected response time to calls from the network.  Assume that the 
station is located at some point X on the network.  Response time then consists of the 
sum of (1) the round-trip travel time between X and the demand and (2) any waiting time 
until the ambulance is dispatched from point X.  Specifically, assume that the speed of 
the ambulance during its travel to and from each demand is equal to 1 and that the time it 
spends on the scene of the demand is exactly 1 unit. Service to demands is provided in a 
first-come, first-served way. 
(c)  (9 points) Identify the optimal location for the ambulance station when λ is very 
small λ≈ 0 +  .  Please justify your answer briefly. 
(d)  (9 points) What is the largest value of λ for which this queueing system will be 
stable?  Where should the station be located for this value of λ?  Please provide a 
clear justification for your answer.

We consider a 2-server spatial queue for ambulances that operates like the traditional 
Hypercube queueing model.  See the symmetric figure above to understand the geometry.  
Calls for ambulance service are uniformly independently distributed over the 
circumference of the circle of radius 1, as shown in the figure.  There are two primary 
response areas, A and B.  Response area A is the half circumference of the circle to the 
right of the vertical diameter drawn in the figure.  Response area B is the half 
circumference to the left of the vertical diameter drawn in the figure.  When idle, i.e., not 
serving customers, ambulance A is equally likely to be stationed at any one of the three 
parking stations, A1, A2 or A3. When idle, ambulance B is equally likely to be stationed 
at any one of its three parking stations, B1, B2 or B3. 

Calls for ambulance service arrive in accordance with a homogeneous Poisson process 
with rate λ =1.0 call/hour.  Travel speed is very fast, so virtually all of the service time is 
on-scene time.  An ambulance always travels the shortest circumferential distance 
between its location and the call for service to which it is dispatched.  Upon completion 
of service at the scene, the ambulance virtually immediately returns to one of its three 
parking stations, picking one of the three at random.   

We model the service time for each customer as being distributed according to a negative 
exponential pdf with mean (1/μ) = 1.0 hour.  The ambulance dispatcher always 
dispatches ambulance A to any customer in response area A, if ambulance A is available.  

3 

Otherwise a customer in response area A is serviced by ambulance B, if ambulance B is 
available.  Symmetrically, the ambulance dispatcher always dispatches ambulance B to 
any customer in response area B, if ambulance B is available.  Otherwise a customer in 
response area B is serviced by ambulance A, if ambulance A is available.  Customers 
  
who arrive when both ambulances are busy are lost forever, i.e., not served.   Thus, we 
have a zero queue capacity system, a ‘loss system.’ 

(a)  Carefully draw the 2-server hypercube state space and transition rate diagram, 
showing all the upward and downward transition rates. 
(b)  Find the utilization factor (i.e., the fraction of time busy serving customers) for 
each ambulance. 
(c)  Compute the mean response distance traveled by an ambulance to a random 
customer. 

Now assume that the dispatcher has an automatic vehicle location system so he knows the 
parking station at which each available ambulance is located.  The dispatch strategy is 
now changed so that when both ambulances are free, i.e., not serving customers, the 
dispatcher will dispatch the closer ambulance to the customer.  For instance, if a customer 
calls in from response area B, near the top of the circle and just to the left of the vertical 
diameter drawn, if ambulance B is available and located at B2 or B3 and if ambulance A 
is located at A1, then ambulance A is closer and is dispatched to the customer.   The other 
 
parts of the dispatch strategy remain unchanged. 

(d)  Carefully draw the 2-server hypercube state space and transition rate diagram, 
showing all the upward and downward transition rates. 
(e)  Find the utilization factor (i.e., the fraction of time busy serving customers) for 
each ambulance. 
(f)	 Compute the mean response distance traveled by an ambulance to a random 
customer.

Problem 3 (22 points) 
Consider the transportation network shown below.  All the link lengths are equal 
to 1 mile.  The two numbers in parentheses next to each node indicate, respectively, the 
rate of demands per hour generated at each node for a repair service from midnight to 
noon (“Period 1”) and from noon to midnight (“Period 2”).  Demands at each node are 
generated independently and in a Poisson manner.  Please note that total demand in each 
period is equal to 25 and that only two nodes have demand rates different from 1 during 
each period. 
The service’s administrator now wishes to locate a facility on the network to 
minimize the average “cost” of travel time from the facility to a random demand.  The 
cost of travel for period i (i = 1 or 2) from point x to node j is equal to  wi  ⋅ hi , j  ⋅ d ( x,  j ) , 
where d(x,j) is the distance between x and j, wi (0≤wi≤1) is the “weight” assigned to 
period i and  hi , j  is the weight of node j during period i.  (For example,  h1,5  = 9 .)  The 
administrator will assign weights w1 and w2 such that w1 + w2 = 1. 

a)  (11 points) Find the optimal location for the facility if w1= w2 = 1/2.  Please 
provide a clear justification for your answer. 

b)	 (11 points) Can node 16 be the optimal location for a facility for some 
combination of w1 and w2?  If yes, please find one such combination.  If no, 
please explain why.
