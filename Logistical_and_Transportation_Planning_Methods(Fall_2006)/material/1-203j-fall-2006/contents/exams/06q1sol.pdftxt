Solutions


Problem 1.  Patrolling Police Car. 

A patrolling police car is assigned to the rectangular sector shown in the figure.  The 
sector is bounded on all four sides by a roadway that requires 50% of the police car’s 
patrolling time.  The other 50% of the time, the car patrols the inner rectangular part of 
the sector.  Thus, at a random time when the police car is available for dispatch, the 
police car’s location is equally likely to be drawn from a uniform distribution over the 
bounding roadway or by a uniform distribution over the rectangular part of the sector 
inside the bounding roadway.  Travel is right-angle or the Manhattan metric, with 
directions of travel parallel to the sides of the rectangle.  911 calls for service are also 
distributed randomly over the rectangular sector, in the same way as the police car and 
independently of the location of the police car.  That is, 50% of the 911 calls are 
uniformly distributed over the bounding roadway and 50% uniformly distributed over the 
inner rectangular part of the sector.  Given a random call for service at a give location, 
the police car will follow a minimum distance right-angle path from its current location 
to the location of the call.  Thus, we assume that the police car can exit the bounding 

2 km 

bounding roadway 

1 km 

roadway at any point, and – as is usual with the right angle metric, we ignore the 
complication of ‘city blocks’, assuming instead an infinitely divisible right-angle travel 
space within the region. 

(a)  Find the mean distance traveled by the police car in response to a random call for 
service. 

Key methods:	

- “Divide & Conquer”

- Expected distance between two random points


Logistical and Transportation Planning


The police car can either be on the highway or in the inner part of the sector, and it is 
the same for the random call for service. Therefore, we have four different cases. The 
probabilities of those events are summarized in the table:

Part 

Case 3: 1/4 

Case 4: 1/4 

For each case, we will determine the expected distance. 

•	 Case 1: 
We have to use the method “Divide and Conquer” again. If the call and the car 
are on two opposite portions of the highway, then the car has to cross the inner 
rectangular region, whereas if they are on the same portion of the highway, the 
car does not have to travel across that region. Thus, the expected distance 
depends on which part of the highway the call and cars are. 
Note: the car can go off the highway, therefore, the problem cannot be reduced to 
a 1-D problem.

(b)  Now assume we have a barrier to travel that rises vertically from the midway 
point on the lower boundary of the sector to 1/2 km inside the sector.  (See figure 
on next page.)  The barrier does not stop travel along the bounding roadway near 
the barrier.  It only prohibits east-west and west-east travel through the barrier 

Logistical and Transportation Planning


within the interior of the sector.  Now find the mean distance traveled in the 
presence of the barrier. 

There are a lot of cases to consider when computing the expected distance. In order to 
reduce the computations we have to make, we will use the “perturbation” method: 
E [D ] = E [Dnormal  ] + E [D perturbation ] . 
The barrier creates a perturbation when the call and the police car are on both sides of 
it. An example is given on the figure below: 

1

The police car might go round the barrier from the top or the bottom. 
Thus, we can define four areas of interest:

•	 The cases were the car and the call are in I and II, or III and IV are similar. 
Let’s consider the case where they are in III and IV, then the extra travel distance 
is D perturbation  = 2 min [Y1 , Y2 ] . Therefore, the expected perturbation distance is:

Problem 2.  Halloween Treat. 

Halloween pumpkins are planted in parallel straight-line rows on a very big field on 
a farm in New England.  The field is so big that we ignore any boundary effects.  The 
parallel rows are two meters apart.  Research has shown that the planter of pumpkin 
seeds was a sort of random fellow, and that we can accurately model the spatial 
distribution of pumpkins along any row as a homogeneous spatial Poisson process 
with parameter γ = 1 pumpkin per meter.  Any given pumpkin has one chance in ten 
of becoming a giant pumpkin for Halloween.  A giant pumpkin weighs more than 30 
pounds!  Otherwise it is a regular sized pumpkin, weighing less than or equal to 30 
pounds.  The sizes of pumpkins are mutually independent. 

(a)  If we walk along any given row of pumpkins, what is the probability that in a walk 
of 100 meters we will have passed 3 or more giant pumpkins on that row? 

The giant pumpkins can also be modeled as a homogeneous spatial Poisson process, with 
γ 

parameter ν = 
10 
Therefore, the probability of passing 3 or more giant pumpkins in a walk of 100 meters is 
P = P(k  in 100 m ≥ 3) 
P = 1 − (P(0 in 100 m ) + P(1 in 100 m) + P(2 in 100 m)) 
2  (100 ν ) k e −100 ν 
P = 1 − (∑ 
k! 
k =0 
P ≈ 0.997 

= 0.1  pumpkin per meter. 

) 

(b)	 If we are standing at the location of a random giant pumpkin, what is the 
probability that at least 3 additional giant pumpkins are within a right-angle 
distance of 10 meters from our location?  (This question includes pumpkins in 

Logistical and Transportation Planning


near-by parallel rows.)


20m long 

16m long 

12m long 

8m long 

4m long 

10m 

We are considering a total of 100 meters. 
Therefore, because we are considering a Poisson process, we can use the result to the 
previous questions where we were also considering a total of 100 meters:  P ≈ 0.997 

Problem 3 

Consider the operation of a government office with a single clerk.  For all practical 
purposes, the office constitutes a queueing system with infinite queue capacity (there are 
lots of chairs to accommodate all those waiting for service).  This operation can be 
modeled as a M/M/1 system with one complication.  The clerk, a capricious person, keeps 
a record of the time when every person seeking service arrives at the office.  Whenever 
there are two or more people waiting at the time when a service is completed, the clerk 
selects the next person to be served in the following way: with probability 0.6 she selects 
the person with the earliest arrival time (i.e., the person who has been waiting the 
longest) and with probability 0.4 the one with the latest arrival time (i.e., the one who 
arrived most recently).  The arrival rate at the office, λ, is equal to 4 per hour and the 
service rate, µ, is 6 per hour. 

(a)  Please draw the state transition diagram for this queueing system, with the state of 
the system indicating the number of people in the office (waiting or being served). 

The state transition diagram of this system is:

(b) Consider the expected values L, W and B (respectively, the average number of 
persons at the office, the average total time spent there, and the average length of a busy 
period for the clerk).  Which, if any, of these three quantities for this queueing system is 
different from the corresponding quantities for a first-come, first-served (FCFS) M/M/1 
system?  Please explain briefly. 

None of the expected values L, W or B changes. To derive those expected values, we 
never had to consider the type of queueing discipline used. Therefore, the expressions are 
independent of the queueing discipline. 

(c) How would the variance of W compare between this office and the FCFS M/M/1 
system?  Please explain briefly. 

However, the variance is not independent of the queueing discipline. On a FCFS system, 
one knows that in order to be served, all the people in front in the queue have to be served 
th 
first. In our system, being the n person in the queue does not mean that we have to wait 
th 
for n-1 people to be served first. If there is nobody behind in the queue, the n person can 
be the next person to be served, or if there is someone, that person could go first and then 
all the other people in front in the queue. Therefore, the variance is greater in our system 
than in the FCFS M/M/1 system. 

Numerical answers should be provided to questions (d) – (f) with brief explanations. 

(d) Person A arrives to find exactly four other persons present at the office, including the 
one being served (but not counting the clerk).  What is the probability that A will be the 
next person to be served? 

If A is the next to be served, then it means that the clerk chose to serve the person with 
the latest arrival and that A is that person. A is the person with the latest arrival in the 
queue if no other persons arrive before the completion of the ongoing service. 

Logistical and Transportation Planning


That probability is the probability that the event following A’s arrival is the service 
completion rather than an arrival. It is given by: 
P( service completition in time iterval  Δt ) 
µ⋅ Δt 
µ 
= 
(µ+ λ) ⋅ Δt  µ+ λ 
P( service completition or  arrival  in time iterval  Δt )
Thus, the probability that A will be the next person to be served is

(e) Person B arrives to find only one other person at the office, i.e., the person being 
currently served by the clerk.  What is the probability that B will be the next person to be 
served by the clerk? 

B will be the next person to be served by the clerk if no one else arrives, or if other 
people arrive but the clerk chooses to serve the person with the earliest arrival time. 
Therefore, the probability is of B being the next one to be served is:

(f) For a randomly chosen person, C, who enters this office (and assuming steady state 
conditions), what is the probability that he will be the next customer served?  [HINT: 
Consider, all the possible states that C may find the office in, and think of what will 
happen for each state.] 

If there are no customers in the system, C is the next one to be served with probability 1. 
If there is one person, C is the next one to be served if:
