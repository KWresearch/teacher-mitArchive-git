1.  P rob lem   1 

P a r t   (a)  
Let  A  = Area  of  i n n e r   region   of  coverage .  

P a r t ( b )  
Let  variance  of  A  = (r2 = E [ A 2 ]- E [A I 2 .Therefore, 

Here 

Thus 

P a r t ( c )  

Prob lem   2 

P a r t  ( a )  
Answer  = 

This  is  the   probability  th a t   a  new  customer  will  arrive  before  service  to   the   first  customer  in  the

busy  period  is  completed. 

Part  (b )  The re  are two  ways  th is   can  happen. 

Prob l   After  first  customer  arrives:  new  customer  arrives  - new  customer  arrives  - three 
service  completions. 

Prob2 After first customer arrives:  new  customer arrives -i service completion - new customer 
arrives  - two  service completions. 

Therefore,  answer  is 

Prob (1 ) + P rob (2 )  

Part  ( C )  Answer  is  'Yes.'  This  is  sufficient.  T h e   condition  X  <  p  prevents  th e   queue  born 
becoming  infinitely  long.  Even  if  X  >> p l ,  all  th a t   will  happen  is  tha t   th e   probability  of  having 

busy  periods   w i th   more  t h a n   one  customer   will  b e   high. 

P a r t   ( d )  Let   a  s t a t e  with   a  prime   (1 ' ,2 ' ,3 '...)  indicates   a  s t a t e  in which  t h e   first  customer   after   a n  
idle  period   is  still   receiving  service.  S t a t e s   1 ,2 ,3...  a r e   s t a t e s   in  which  t h e   first  customer   a f t e r  a n  
idle  period   has  already   left  t h e  system .  

Problem  3 

Part  (a )  Suppose  we  have  cd f  Fx(x)a n d  pdf  f ,(x)   a n d  we  are   to ld   t h a t   Y  = a x , where  a  > 0 .  
Here  Y  = 200X1  i.e.,  a = 200.  T h a t   is, we  have  scaled  all  distances  from  1 t o  200. 

T h u s ,  

So ,  before  t runca t ion ,  we  have  

1 
1 
f y  (Y )= ZGr  1+ (y/200)2  
for  all  values  of  y.  T runca t ion   event  = T = -200  < Y  < 200. 

So ,  we  can   finally  write ,  

f y l T ( ~ l T )= ~ Y ( Y ) / ~ T ( ~ )= ( l / l o h )  

1 
1+ ( ~ / 2 0 0 ) ~  

for  - 200  < y  < 200 

Part  (b )  Mean  = 0  by  symme t ry   a n d  finiteness  of  t h e  pdf.  Variance  is  finite  by  bounded  pdf. 

Part  ( c )  Question   asks   for
