True, but please answer all questions on your own, showing all work.  Good luck. 

Problem 1 (20 points) 

Mendel arrives at a bus stop at which busses appear under a Poisson process with rate λ 
per minute.    Let random variable h be the length in minutes of the interval in which he 
arrives.
 What is the mean of h?    Explain.   (There is more than one way to do this 
problem.) 

Problem 2 (20 points) 

Suppose that x1 and x2  are U(0,a) and independent, and let z = x1x2. 
 Use Crofton’s 
method to find the mean of z. 
(Hint:    To what power of ‘a’ do you think z would be 
proportional? 

Problem 3 (30 points) 

Consider a square city of side 1, with (0,0) as its lower left corner.   The city has a barrier 
at x = 1/2 that extends across the city, and another at y = 2/5.  At the intersection of these 
two barriers is a point through which vehicles can pass.   All travel must be on 
North/South and East/West grids, and all travel must take place within the city (i.e., there 
can be no shortcuts involving the suburbs). 

If two points are picked at random in the city: 

(i)	

What is the probability that the barriers will increase the shortest grid distance 
between them? 

(ii)	 What is the maximum possible increase in grid distance caused by the 

barriers?  Briefly explain.


(iii)	 What is the mean travel distance between two points in the city for which the 
grid distance is greater because of the barriers? 

Problem 4 (30 points) 

Consider a queueing system with two parallel servers and no space for queueing. 

This facility serves two types of customers.  Type 1 customers arrive in a Poisson manner 
at a rate of λ1  per minute.  The service time to these customers has a negative exponential 
pdf with a rate of μ1  per minute for each server.  Note that any Type 1 customers who 
find both servers busy are lost. 

Type 2 customers are more unusual.  They too arrive in a Poisson manner at a rate of λ2 
per minute.  However, each one of these customers occupies simultaneously TWO 
servers (i.e., both of the servers).  The servers work together on each of these Type 2 
customers.  The service time to these customers also has a negative exponential pdf with 
a rate of μ2  per minute.  (Note that this means that the two servers begin and end service 
to each Type 2 customer simultaneously and, together, can serve μ2  Type 2 customers per 
minute if working continuously on Type 2 customers.)  Type 2 customers who do not 
find two available servers upon arrival are lost. 

(a)  (6 points) What is the condition for this system to reach steady state? 

(b)  (12 points) Please draw a state transition diagram that describes this queueing 
system.  Please make sure to define clearly the states. 

(c)  (6 points) Write expressions for the fraction of Type 1 customers and for the 
fraction of Type 2 customers who are lost by this system, assuming that the 
system is in steady state.  Your expressions should be in terms of λ1, μ1, λ2  and μ2. 

(d)  (6 points) What is L, the expected number of Type 1 customers in this queueing 
system in steady state?  Once again your expression should be in terms of λ1, μ1, 
λ2  and μ2.
