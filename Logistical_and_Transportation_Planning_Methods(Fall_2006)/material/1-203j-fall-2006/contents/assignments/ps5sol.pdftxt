a)  We are in the case of congestion pricing.  
1λ = 30 /hr and  1c = $2/min = $120/hr 
Type 1 customers: 
2λ = 24 /hr and 
2c = $3/min = $180/hr 
Type 2 customers: 
1λ + 2λ = 54/hr. 

Thus λ=

The external cost is the same because the service time for the two types of customers is the same.

2S  be service time of Type 2 customers: E[

Now, the external costs are different. The external cost is higher for Type 2 customers because 
their service time is higher.  
 

e) Type 1 customers should be assigned priority because the ratio

f) Let’s compute the total cost of waiting at the facility per hour, given that Type 1 customers 
have the priority over Type 2 customers.

This is a 14.7% improvement compared to the cost in c).

g) We have the two rations 1f = 4 $/min and 
2f , Type 1 customers 
1f > 
2f = 1.85 $/min. Since 
should be assigned priority, in order to minimize the expected cost of the total time that the all 
customers spend in the system.  
 
h) The service times are no longer deterministic. Therefore, the expected waiting times will 
increase.
