qW is lower than in part 1 and part 9 because we are now giving the priority to 
In this new case, 
the customers with the shortest expected time.  
A corollary takes advantage of this phenomenon ( p239 of the textbook):   
To minimize the average waiting time for all users in the system, assign priorities according to 
the expected service times for each user class: the shorter the expected service time, the higher 
the priority of the class.

This time, Class B customers have the priority. They have the greatest expected service time. 
qW  increases.  
Therefore, the overall

Problem 4 
 
(a)  A state is defined by (a,b,c) where:   
a = the type of the customer(s) (0, 1, or 2) currently in service (you cannot have 
one server occupied by a Type 1 customer and the other server occupied by a 
Type 2 customer at the same time),  

b = the number of Type 2 customers (0, 1, or 2) in the system,  

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
The corresponding state transition diagram for the system is:   

 

 

c = the number of Type 1 customers (0, 1, 2, 3 or 4) in the system.

(b)  The event of interest can happen only by having a set of three consecutive transitions from 
state (1,0,4) to (1,0,3) to (1,0,2) to (1,1,2). We have:

Problem 5 
 
 
 
(c)  A state is defined by (a,b) where  a describes the first facility and b the second one.  
 
  a = 0 if there are no customers 
1 if there is one customer  
 
 
 
 
2 if there are 2 customers
