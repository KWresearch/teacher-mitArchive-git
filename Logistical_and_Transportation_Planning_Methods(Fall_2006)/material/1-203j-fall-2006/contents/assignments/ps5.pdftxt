Problem 5 

Consider a service facility at which Type 1 and Type 2 customers arrive in a Poisson 
manner at the rate of λ1= 30 per hour and λ2= 24 per hour, respectively.  Service at the 
facility is FIFO and service times are constant and last exactly 1 minute for either type of 
customer.  The cost of waiting in the queue per minute is $2 and $3 per Type 1 and Type 
2 customers, respectively.  Assume steady state conditions throughout the problem. 
Numerical answers are expected in all parts. 

(a)  What is the total expected cost of waiting time at this facility per hour? 
(b)  Find the internal cost and the external cost associated with a marginal Type 1 
customer and repeat for the internal and external cost associated with a Type 2 
customer.  How do the external costs compare and why? 

Assume now and for parts (c) – (f) of this problem that service to Type 1 customers lasts 
exactly 0.5 minute and to Type 2 customers exactly 1.625 minutes.  The cost of waiting 
per minute is still $2 and $3 per Type 1 and Type 2 customers, respectively, and service 
is still FIFO. 

(c)  Repeat part (a).  A numerical answer is expected once again. 
(d)  Repeat part (b) and comment on differences you see with the results of part (b). 

Suppose now that you were asked to assign non-preemptive priorities to the two types of 
customers in a way that will minimize the total expected cost of waiting at the facility. 

(e)  Which type of customer should be assigned higher priority and why? 
(f)  Under the priorities assigned in part (e), what is the total expected cost of waiting 
at this facility per hour?  How does this cost compare with the cost you found in 
part (c)?

Suppose now that the service times for Type 1 customers are negative exponential with 
an expected value of 0.5 minute and for Type 2 customers negative exponential with an 
expected value of 1.625 minutes.  As for parts (e) and (f), the cost of waiting per minute 
is still $2 and $3 per Type 1 and Type 2 customers, respectively, and you are asked to 
assign non-preemptive priorities to the two types of customers in a way that will 
minimize the total expected cost of waiting at the facility. 

(g) Which type of customer should be assigned higher priority and why? 
(h)  Under the priorities assigned in part (g), what is the total expected cost of waiting 
at this facility per hour?  How does this cost compare with the cost you found in 
part (c) and part (f)?
