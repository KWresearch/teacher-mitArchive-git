Problem 1 

P  = 1 − ρ with  ρ =

(a)  If Bo did not have to wait, then he arrived while the system was empty. For an M/M/1 
queueing system, the probability to be in the state with no customer is: 
λ 
.
µ 
If Alvin had to wait, then Bo was still in service when he arrived, since no customer 
can go into the building between Bo and Alvin’s arrivals. The probability that Bo’s 
service is longer than 2 minutes is  e −2µ . Therefore, the probability that Bo did not 
have to wait at all for the service but that Alvin did have to wait is:

(b) The probability that Bo finds 8 customers is the steady state probability of their being 
8 customers in an M/M/1 system at a random point in time. This is just  ρ8 (1 − ρ) . If 
only one customer is in service when Alvin arrives, then it must be Bo. This means 
that in the two minutes between Bo and Alvin’s arrivals exactly 8 departures must 
have occurred from the system. Since we are talking about the departure process of 
customers already in the system we can think of them as departing according to a 
Poisson process of rate  µ . 
Therefore the probability of exactly eight customers leaving during the two minutes is 
the probability of having 8 poisson occurances in two minutes which is given by: 
(2µ)8 e −2µ 
8! 
µ = 1  customer per minute. We get that the probability of the event described in part 
(b) is: 

. Plugging in our known values of λ = 0.4  customers per minute and 

ρ 8 (1 − ρ) (2µ)8 e −2µ
8! 

= 3.39 ⋅ 10 −7

no difference whether all k mgchanics finish reparing the first bus  to  break down 
before starting work  on the second  bus to  break  d m ,  or whether  they split up 
when  the  second  bus  breaks dmm.  Since pi  is constant, this  is  equitdent  to  an 
l I / k i / l   queue,  for  which  = A/(p - A )   = 1/[5/2 - 1) = 2 / [ k  - 2 )   (thus,  k 
has  to  be  a t  least  three  far  stability), sa 

Differentiating w i th   respect  to k  and setting equal  t o  zero  we  get 

Thus  the  optimal number  of  mechanics must be either four or five.  13% have

E [ q l k = 8= 80 and  E[Cll,=,  = 76-3 
so k* = 5 minimizes cost  per hour.

Problem 5 

For each scenario, the total cost per minute is  TC i  = 1 ⋅ Li  + C i  with  i = 1 or  2 . We have 
to find the expected number of cars for each scenario. 

If there is only one server, the system can be modeled as an M/M/1 system with infinite 
capacity. According to the formula derived in class we have

L  =
1  µ1  − λ  1 15 − 1 40 

= 0.6 .

If there are two parallel servers, the system can be modeled as an M/M/2 system with 
infinite capacity. The corresponding state transition diagram is the following:
