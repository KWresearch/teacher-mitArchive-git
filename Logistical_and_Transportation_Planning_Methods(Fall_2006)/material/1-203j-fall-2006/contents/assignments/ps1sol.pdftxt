With plan  i , we would pay at the end of the month:  Di  + C i  max (Ttot  − M i ,0) . 
We would choose the plan that minimizes the expected value of this expression.

Thus, we are interested in:

arg i  min( E[Di  + C i  max (Ttot  − M i ,0)]) = arg i  min{ Di  + C i  ⋅ E[max (Ttot  − M i ,0)]}

We can use the Central Limit Theorem to approximate the distribution of  Ttot . We would have to

use the Central Limit Theorem again to simulate the expected value of the maximum, and then

choose the appropriate plan from the analysis of the different simulations.


(f). The advocate’s statement may not be true. Consider the following counterexample in which

there are only 2 plans available.  (D1 , C1 , M 1 ) = (1,1,1)  and  (D2 , C 2 , M 2 ) = (99,0.5,10 5 ) . Let T

be the r.v. representing the customer’s talk time in a month. Suppose we have that

P(T  ≥ M 2 ) = 0 and  P(T  ≥ 100) = 1 . Then, the customer will always spend at least $100 on plan 
1 but never more than $99 on plan 2, even though he/she never uses all  M 2  minutes in plan 2. 
So, plan 2 is actually cheaper for this customer.

Problem 4 
Pedestrian Crossing Problem, revisited 

There is no single correct answer to this problem. 

The goal is to design a system that takes into account both the pedestrians, who do not want to 
wait too long before the light turns green for them, and the drivers, who do not want to stop too 
often. 

We are therefore mainly interested in: 
the expected time that a randomly arriving pedestrian must wait; 
1. 
2. 
the expected time between dumps. 
One of these two measures can be fixed. Let’s say we first want the expected waiting time for a 
pedestrian to be a constant for the three rules. The parameters of the rules (T, To and N) required 
to achieve such a goal could then be determined, and the other measure, the expected time 
between dumps, computed. That could be repeated for different values of the arrival rate of 
pedestrians λ .  The arrival rate of cars should not be neglected either. We do not want traffic

jams in front of 77 Mass. Ave.

That would be one way of comparing the different rules.

Not all the rules are easy to implement. Rule A and Rule C are more systematic and reliable than 
Rule B. 

From that analysis, we can assign one rule to each particular situation (defined by the arrival rates 
of the pedestrians and the cars). 

Once that we have a list of all the different types of situations, with their corresponding arrival 
rates and suggested rule, we can determine in which categories falls each time slot of the week. A 
schedule could then be proposed to our two sponsors.
