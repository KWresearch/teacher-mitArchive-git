Congestion pricing: 

The basic observation

•	 The congestion costs due to any specific user 
have 2 components: 
(1) Cost of delay to that user (internal cost) 
(2) Cost of delay to all other users caused by that user 
(external cost) 

•	 At congested facilities, this second component 
can be very large 

•	 A congestion toll can be imposed to force
users to experience this cost component  (to
“internalize the external costs”) 

Economic principle 

Optimal use of a transportation facility cannot be 
achieved unless each additional (marginal) 
user pays for all the additional costs that this 
user imposes on all other users and on the 
facility itself.  A congestion toll not only 
contributes to maximizing social economic 
welfare, but is also necessary to reach such a 
result.  (Vickrey, 1967, 1969; Carlin + Park, 
1970) 

Two hard technical problems 

•  In practice it is very hard to: 
(1)	 Estimate external marginal delay costs  
(extensive data analysis and/or simulation 
have been typically needed – subtle issues); 

(2) 	 Determine equilibrium  congestion tolls (trial-
and-error approach that may take long time to 
converge) 

• Queueing theory has much to offer (especially
with regard to the first problem) under certain
conditions. 

Computing Internal and External 

Costs

Consider a queueing facility with a single type of users in 
steady-state. Let 
c = delay cost per unit time per user 
C = total cost of delay per unit time incurred in the system 
C  = cLq  = cλWq 
Then: 
and the marginal delay cost, MC , imposed by an 
additional (“marginal”) user is given by: 
dW q
dC	
= c W + cλ
MC =
q

Numerical Example 

•	 Three types of aircraft; Poisson; FIFO service 
_  Non-jets:  λ1  = 40 per hour; c1 = $600 per hour 
_  Narrow-body jets:  λ2  = 40 per hour; c2 = $1,800 per hour 
_  Wide-body jets:  λ3  = 10 per hour; c3 = $4,200 per hour 
_  Total demand is: λ = λ1  + λ2  + λ3  = 90 per hour 
•	 pdf for service times is uniform 
_  U[25 sec, 47 sec] 
_  E[S] = 36 sec = 0.01 hour;  μ = 100 per hour

= 

90 ⋅ [(0.01) 2  + 3.11213 × 10 −6 ]

Generalizing to m types of users…

[ i ] ;
μ−1  = E S

i 
i 
cost per unit of time in the system  c i 

• For entire set of facility users, we have

Generalization (continued) 

• As before:  C  = cL = cλ W
q
q 
dW q 
dC  = ciW q  + cλ 
dλ i 
dλ i

giving:  MC ( i ) = 

• When we have explicit expressions for Wq, we 
can also compute explicitly the total marginal 
delay cost MC(i), the internal (or private) cost 
and the external cost associated with each 
additional user of type i 

Example 

For  an M/G/1 system: 

MC (i ) = 

λ E[S 2 ]
2 ] +
(1 − ρ)E[S i

λ⋅ E[S  ]

= ci  2(1 − ρ) 
+ cλ

• Can extend further to cases with user priorities 

Finding Equilibrium Conditions 
and Optimal Congestion Tolls! 
We now generalize further: let  xi  be the total cost 
    
perceived by a user of type i for access to a congested 
facility and let           λi ( xi )  be the demand function for type i 
users. 
x i  = IC i  + CTi  + K i 
ICi  = internal private cost; it is a function of the demand 
rates, λi ( xi ) 
CTi  = congestion toll imposed; equal to 0 in absence of 
congestion tolls; can be set arbitrarily or can be set as a 
function of the λi ( xi )under congestion pricing schemes 

Ki  = any other charges that are independent of level of 
congestion 

Finding Equilibrium Conditions and 

Optimal Congestion Tolls! [2]


•  With m types of users, the equilibrium conditions for  

any set of demand functions, can be found by solving  

simultaneously the m equations: 

dW  [λˆ (xˆ )] 
)⎞
⎛ m
c  ⋅λ (

where λˆ ( xˆ ) = {λ1 ( x1 ),λ2 ( x2 ),...,λm ( xm )} .

∀i

The missing piece: Demand functions can 

only be roughly estimated, at best!

Important to note… 

•	 The external costs computed in the absence 
of congestion pricing give only an upper
bound on the magnitude of the congestion-
based fees that might be charged 
•	 These are not necessarily “equilibrium 
prices” 
•	 Equilibrium prices may turn out to be
considerably lower than these upper
bounds 
•	 Equilibrium prices are hard to estimate, 
absent knowledge of demand functions 

Case of LaGuardia (LGA) 

•	 Since 1969: Slot-based High Density Rule (HDR) 
_  DCA, JFK, LGA, ORD; “buy-and-sell” since 1985 
•	 Early 2000: About 1050 operations per weekday at LGA 
•	 April 2000: Air-21 (Wendell-Ford Aviation Act for 21st Century) 
Immediate exemption from HDR for aircraft seating 70 or fewer pax
_	
on service between small communities and LGA 
•	 By November 2000 airlines had added over 300 movements per
day; more planned: virtual gridlock at LGA 
•	 December 2000: FAA and PANYNJ implemented slot lottery and 
announced intent to develop longer-term policy for access to LGA 
•	 Lottery reduced LGA movements by about 10%; dramatic reduction 
in LGA delays 
•	 June 2001:  Notice for Public Comment posted with regards to 
longer-term policy that would use “market-based” mechanisms 
•	 Process stopped after September 11, 2001; re-opened in 2004

Issues that arise in practice 

-- Toll may vary in time and by location 
-- Facility users may be driven by “network” 
considerations 
-- “Social benefit” considerations 
-- Political issues 
-- What to do with the money?
