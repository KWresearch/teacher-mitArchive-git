Congestion Pricing and Queueing Theory 

Congestion Pricing 

Congestion costs due to any specific user have 2 components: 

(1) Cost of delay to that user (internal) 

(2) Cost of delay to all other users caused by that user (external) 

--At congested airports (and congested facilities, in general) this second 
component can be very large 

--A congestion toll can be imposed to force users to experience this cost 
component  (to internalize the external costs) 

Economic principle 

Optimal use of a transportation facility cannot be achieved unless each additional 
(marginal) user pays for all the additional costs that this user imposes on all other users 
and on the facility itself.  Thus, a congestion toll not only contributes to a socially 
desirable result, but is necessary to reach such a result.  (Vickrey, 1967; Carlin + Park, 
1970) 

Congestion Pricing and Queueing Theory 

In practice it is very hard to: 

(1) 	 Estimate external marginal delay costs (extensive data analysis or difficult simulation 
is typically needed); 

(2) 	 Determine equilibrium  congestion tolls (trial-and error approach that may take long 
time to converge is used sometimes). 

Queueing theory has much to offer in these two respects under certain conditions.

The Principal Observation 

Consider a queueing facility with a single type of customer in steady-state. 

Let 

c = delay cost per unit time per customer 

C = total cost of delay per unit time incurred in the system at equilibrium 

Then: 

C  = cLq  = cλWq 

and the marginal delay cost, MC, imposed by an additional (“marginal”) customer is 
given by: 

MC  = 

dWq 
dC 
= c  Wq  + cλ 
dλ 
dλ 
Note that the first term on the right is the “internal cost” experienced by the marginal 
customer and the second term is the “external cost” (s)he imposes! 

These ideas can be extended to cases with multiple types of customers and to systems 
with priorities.

-expected queueing time per customer at  
equilibrium 
-total cost of delay per unit time incurred in the  
system in equilibrium 

Generalization of (1) (for a system with no priorities among customer types) 

Assume now that we have m types of customers, with customers of type i having: an 
arrival rate λi ; a service time S i with service rate μi   and expected service time 
−1  = E [
]S i  ; and delay cost per unit of time  ci . 
μi 

Then, using the definitions provided above, we can still write for a queueing system in 
equilibrium (need  ρ< 1 ): 

Lq  = λWq 

 

 

[Little’s Law] 

Therefore, 

C  = cLq  = cλWq 

and 

MC (i ) =

dC 
dλi 

dWq
= ciWq  + cλ 
dλi 

Implication of (1) and (2) 

(2) 

For many types of queueing systems explicit expressions for Wq  are available.  In such 
cases, (1) or (2) can be used to compute MC and marginal external costs.  The lecture 
notes (Lecture 6) provide a couple of examples for M/G/1 systems. 

Extension 1 

• A similar analysis can be applied (and closed form results can be obtained) in cases in 
which customers are assigned priorities for service depending on their type. 

• Note that in this case, each type of customer i experiences a different expected time in 
the system, W qi , depending on their priority. 

• Many important practical applications.

Extension 2 

• Let λi ( xi )  be the demand rate by type i  customers when the total cost of using the 
facility (internal costs plus external costs) is equal to  xi . 

• If the functions λi ( xi )  are known for all i, then we can compute the equilibrium 
congestion tolls by solving a system of m equations of the form

Some Additional Issues 

Toll may vary in time and by location 

Facility users may be driven by  “network” considerations 

“Social benefit” considerations 

May have to achieve revenue targets
