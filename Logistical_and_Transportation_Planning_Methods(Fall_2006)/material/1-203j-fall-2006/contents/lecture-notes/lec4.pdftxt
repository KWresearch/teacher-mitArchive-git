1.  The R.V.’s

(cid:139) Y = distance from the center of the 
needle to closest of equidistant parallel 
lines   0< y < d/2
(cid:139)Φ= angle of needle wrt horizontal       
0< φ< π

3.  Joint Probability Distribution

(cid:139) Want fY,Φ(y,φ)
(cid:139) Think about that tricky phrase,            
“At random”
(cid:139) fΦ(φ) = 1/π   0 < φ < π
(cid:139) fY (y) = 2/d 0 < y < d/2
(cid:139) Independence implies
fY,Φ(y,φ) = fΦ(φ) fY (y)= constant = 2/(π d)

Three correct answers:  1/3, 1/4 and 1/2  !!!!
Be very careful about that ambiguous word, "random".
