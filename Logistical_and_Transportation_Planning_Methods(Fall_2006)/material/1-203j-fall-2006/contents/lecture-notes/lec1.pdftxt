A Jogging Problem.

•  Joggers enter the circular jogging loop shown in
the figure as a homogeneous Poisson process
with rate parameter λ joggers per hour. 
•  Immediately upon entry to the jogging loop each
runner flips a fair coin.  Outcomes of flips are
mutually independent.  If the outcome for a 
particular jogger is Heads, she jogs around the
loop in a clockwise manner.  If the outcome is 
Tails, she jogs around the loop in a counter-
clockwise manner. 
•  The loop is 1/4 mile in length.  All joggers run at
the same high speed, running at a rate of 8-
minute miles.  Thus each completes one loop
around in 2 minutes. 
•	 Just before completion of a loop, each jogger
again flips a fair coin – while running.  If the 
outcome is Heads, she completes her daily run
and immediately exits the jogging loop.  If the 
outcome is Tails, she continues without any
delay (in the same direction) for at least one
more loop.  This coin flipping process is
continued near the completion of each successful
loop until the jogger eventually exits the jogging
loop.

•	 Find the mean distance jogged by a random
jogger.  What is the probability that a jogger will
jog more than 3 miles on a given day? 
•	 Assuming the system has been operating for a
long time, find the probability that at a random
time the entire jogging loop contains j joggers, j
= 0, 1, 2, 3, …. 

•	 Clyde is standing at 12:00 o’clock with a
stopwatch.  Each time instant that any jogger
jogs past him is called a PASS.  He is recording
the ‘gap times’ between successive PASSes,
regardless of a jogger’s direction of travel and
regardless of how many times a jogger may have
passed him before.  Thus the ith  gap time that
Clyde records is the time (in minutes) between
the i+1st  PASS and the ith PASS, i = 1, 2, 3, ….
Suppose he records these inter-PASS gap times
for 1,000 joggers and plots those times in a
histogram.  Please characterize the likely
description of this histogram, as to shape and
mean value.  Do this for 
λ = 500 joggers per hour and for 
λ =  1.0  jogger per hour. 

SOLUTIONS. 
Key is to realize that sums of independent Poisson 
processes are Poisson.  Poisson events in disjoint 
time intervals are independent.  Bernoulli erasers of 
Poisson events yield Poisson events. 

Let L = number of loops that a jogger jogs. 
(a)	
P{L=k} = (1/2)k , k=1,2,3,…; E[L] = 2
The mean distance jogged by a random jogger =
(1/4)E[L] = (1/4)2 = 0.5 mi.
The probability that a jogger will jog more than
3 miles on a given day =
P{L > 12} = (1 / 2)13  + (1 / 2)14 +(1 / 2)15  + ... = (1 / 2)13 [1 + (1 / 2) + (1 / 2) 2  + ...] 
P{L > 12} = (1 / 2)13  /[1 − (1 / 2)] = (1 / 2)12 
We could have written this by inspection, 
realizing that to jog more than 3 miles requires 
12 Tails in a row at end of each of the first 12 
loops. 

(b)	
The number of joggers on the track at a 
random time is equal to the number who arrived 
within the last 2 minutes (a Poisson r.v. with 
mean 2λ/60), plus the number who arrived in the 
previous 2 minutes and who are jogging their 2nd 
loop (a Poisson r.v. with mean λ/60), plus the 
number who arrived in the previous 2 minutes 
and who are jogging their 3rd loop (a Poisson r.v. 

€

€

with mean λ/(2*60)), plus etc., etc.  Sums of 
independent Poisson r.v.’s are Poisson with 
mean equal to sum of the means.  Thus the total 
number of joggers on the track at a random time 
is a Poisson r.v., with mean 
(2λ + λ + λ / 2 + λ / 4 + ...) / 60 = 2λ(1 + [1 / 2] + [1 / 4] + ...) / 60 = 4λ / 60 .

 Thus,  P{J =  j} = (4λ / 60) j e−4 λ / 60  / j!,  j = 0,1,2, ... 
(c)  For λ = 500 joggers per hour Clyde is ‘seeing’ 
Poisson passes at a rate of 1000 PASSES per 
€
hour [see part (b) above].  1000 PASSES per 
hour is 1000/60 = 16.67 PASSES per minute, 
corresponding to a mean gap of 0.06 minutes or 
3.6 seconds.  The histogram would resemble a 
negative exponential curve with mean 3.6 
seconds. For λ =  1.0  jogger per hour we have 
two types of PASSES:  those of a newly arriving 
jogger who is on her first loop and repeat joggers 
who are on other than first loop.  This 2nd 
category is important here as the time between 
repeats is only 2 minutes (and deterministic) 
whereas the time between new 1st loop joggers is 
one hour and is exponentially distributed. 
Roughly half the PASSES will be joggers on 
their first loop and the other half will be joggers 
on 2nd or later loops.  Thus approximately half of 
the inter-PASS gaps will be negative exponential 

with mean one hour and the remainder will be 
deterministic at 2 minutes.  The histogram would 
thus resemble a negative exponential curve with 
mean one hour with an added spike or impulse at 
2 minutes, with approximately 50% of the area 
under the total curve.
