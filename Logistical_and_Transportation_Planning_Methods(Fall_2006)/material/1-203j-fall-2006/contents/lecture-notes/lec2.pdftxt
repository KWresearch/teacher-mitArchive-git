4  Steps:

1.  Define the Random Variables
2.  Identify the joint sample space
3.  Determine the probability law over the         
sample space
4.  Carefully work in the sample space to 
answer any question of interest

4  Steps: Functions of R.V.s

1.  Define the Random Variables
2.  Identify the joint sample space
3.  Determine the probability law over the         
sample space
4.  Carefully work in the sample space to 
answer any question of interest
4a.  Derive the CDF of the R.V. of interest, working 
in the original sample space whose probability
law you know
4b  Take the derivative to obtain the desired PDF

– X1 = location of the accident
– X2 = location of the ambulance
– D = response distance = | X1 - X2 |
(cid:139) 2.  Joint sample space is unit square in 
X1 X2 plane
(cid:139) 3.  PDF over square is uniform
