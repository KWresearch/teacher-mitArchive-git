***** Course Description *****
The class will cover quantitative techniques of Operations Research with
emphasis on applications in transportation systems analysis (urban, air, ocean,
highway, pick-up and delivery systems) and in the planning and design of
logistically oriented urban service systems (e.g., fire and police departments,
emergency medical services, emergency repair services). It presents a unified
study of functions of random variables, geometrical probability, multi-server
queueing theory, spatial location theory, network analysis and graph theory,
and relevant methods of simulation. There will be discussion focused on the
difficulty of implementation, among other topics.
