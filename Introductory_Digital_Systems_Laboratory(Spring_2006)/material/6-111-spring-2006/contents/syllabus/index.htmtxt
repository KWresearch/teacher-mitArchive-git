***** Recommended Books *****
[Amazon_logo] Katz, Randy, and Gaetano Borriello. Contemporary Logic Design.
2nd ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2004. ISBN: 9780201308570.
There are plenty of good VerilogÂ® books and online resources. We recommend the
following book for a basic introduction to VerilogÂ®:
[Amazon_logo] Palnitkar, Samir. VerilogÂ® HDL. 2nd ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:
Prentice Hall, 2003. ISBN: 9780130449115.
***** Component Pinouts/Data *****
Pinouts for most components are easily available through the Web (e.g., do a
Googleâ¢ search to locate the appropriate data sheet). Relevant sheets needed
for the labs are available in labs section.
***** Conduct of the Subject *****
**** Classes ****
In the first couple of weeks of the term, there will be lectures on Friday (to
quickly ramp up on material needed for lab 1). Then, Fridays will be used for
recitations (three parallel recitation sections). Lectures and recitations are
discontinued at the end of the term so you can focus on the final project (see
course schedule for details). We will meet in the lecture hall for project
group presentations after the block diagram conferences.
**** Laboratory Assignments ****
All laboratory exercises must be completed; these are intended to prepare you
for the term project. In doing these exercises, each student works
individually. We strongly recommend that you use a computer-based drawing
package to draw block diagrams and schematics for the lab reports and final
project.
**** Problem Sets ****
Three problem sets will be issued. The problem sets will emphasize the material
covered in lectures and recitations and the primary goal is to help you prepare
for the labs.
**** Quiz ****
There will be one quiz during the term before Drop Date.
**** Term Project ****
The most important assignment is the Term Project, about which you will receive
more detailed instruction later. In doing this assignment, you will work with
one or, at most, two partners. You should begin finding your partner(s) early
in the term.
**** Grading Policy ****
The Lab 1 checkoff sheet is to be initialed by a TA or LA and included with
your report. Note that the checkoff sheet is not the report. Lab 1 report
template is available in the labs section.
Lab 2 report will be used for part of the CIM requirement. More details will be
provided in lecture.
Lab 3 will only include the checkoff. There is no need to write a detailed lab
report for lab 3. The lab will have instructions on what is to be turned in.
Lab 4 has an intermediate checkoff (not graded) and the final checkoff. There
is virtually no modification required to a report depending on the working of
your lab implementation. However, reports with no lab effort will receive a
zero.
The term project requirements must be completed in accordance with the schedule
given in the instructions. You must make a presentation of your part of your
project to the rest of the class after the logic diagram conference. You must
demonstrate (i.e., present) your term project even if it does not fully
function, and you must submit the written report in order to receive a passing
grade.
An approximate breakdown for final grades is as follows:
                          Grading criteria.
ACTIVITIES                                                 PERCENTAGES
Quiz                                                       10%
Three problem sets                                         3%
Lab 1                                                      9%
Lab 2                                                      10%
Lab 3                                                      7%
Lab 4                                                      11%
Writing (Lab 2 revision - part of CIM requirement)         10%
Participation (Lecture, recitation, project presentations) 3%
Final project                                              37%

***** Late Penalties *****
Late work will be penalized. Lateness of the lab assignments will result in a
20% per day penalty for work completed 1-5 working days after the due date. No
point credit will be given for unexcused lateness exceeding 5 days. The final
project must be done on time.
***** Collaboration *****
You may discuss labs with anyone (staff, former students, other students,
etc.), but then do the work on them individually. Do not copy anything,
including computer files, from anyone else.
Collaboration with your partners on the project is desirable. Project reports
should be joint with individual authors specified for each section. You may
copy anything you want, with appropriate attribution, for your project report.
