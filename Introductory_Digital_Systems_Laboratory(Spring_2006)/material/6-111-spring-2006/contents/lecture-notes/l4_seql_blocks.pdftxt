(cid:131) Combinational logic circuits are memoryless
(cid:131) No feedback in combinational logic circuits 
(cid:131) Output assumes the function implemented by the 
logic  network, assuming that the switching 
transients have settled
(cid:131) Outputs can have multiple logical transitions 
before settling to the correct value

(cid:131) Sequential circuits have memory (i.e., remember the past)
(cid:131) The current state is “held” in memory and the next state is 
computed based the current state and the current inputs
(cid:131) In a synchronous systems, the clock signal orchestrates the 
sequence of events

(cid:131) Flip-flop refers to a bi-stable element (edge-triggered registers are also 
called flip-flops) – this circuit is not clocked and outputs change 
“asynchronously” with the inputs

Implementing D FF with a J-K FF:
1) Start with K-map of Q+ = ƒ(D, Q)
2) Create K-maps for J and K with same inputs (D, Q)
3) Fill in K-maps with appropriate values for J and K 
to cause the same state changes as in the original K-map

Design Procedure (cont.)

Implementing J-K FF with a D FF:
1) K-Map of Q+ = F(J, K, Q)
2,3) Revised K-map using D's excitation table
its the same!  that is why design procedure with D FF is simple!

Resulting equation is the combinational logic input to D 
to cause same behavior as J-K FF.  Of course it is identical
to the characteristic equation for a J-K FF.
