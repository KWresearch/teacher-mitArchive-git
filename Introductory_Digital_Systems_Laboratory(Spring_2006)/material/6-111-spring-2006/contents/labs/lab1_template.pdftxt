Lab 1: Checkoff Sheet 

Be  prepared  to  show  relevant  diagrams  as  requested  in  each  problem. You may  get  checked  off 
per problem, rather than the whole lab at once. Collect initials for each problem on this sheet and 
turn it in with your report.

Lab 1: Report Template 

This report template is useful to prepare for each exercise â€™s checkoff. Fill in answers for the ques(cid:173)
tions requested by exercise; you may use a different sheet of paper if more convenient, but be sure 
to follow  the  template. Be sure  to prepare relevant diagrams as  requested by each problem. Turn 
in this report after completing the lab 1 checkoff. 

Exercise 1: TTL/CMOS Static Electrical Characteristics 

Low Voltage Measurement (In = 1) for 74LS00:


High Voltage Measurement (In = 0) for 74LS00: 


Low Voltage Measurement (In = 1) for 74HC00: 


High Voltage Measurement (In = 0) for 74HC00:


For  each  of  these  measurements,  does  the  output  satisfy  the  ranges  specified  in  the  appropriate 

datasheets? Explain.


What problems could arise from using the LS series with the HC series (at +5V supply)?

Exercise 2:  Build your own ring oscillator 

Please  draw  out  the  waveform  showing  the  output  for  the  5-inverter  oscillator  ring.  Be  sure  to 
label the maximum and minimum voltages, and label the appropriate time intervals. 

What is the average TTL inverter propagation delay? Show calculations and briefly explain. 

Estimate  the  period  of  oscillation  for  a  3  inverter  ring,  rather  than  5?  Explain.  What  was  your 
measured result? 

3 

What happens  if you add  a  long piece of wire  to  the 3  inverter  ring? Explain what causes  this  to 
happen. 

What  is  the voltage measurement when you  connect  the  output  to  the  input of  a  single  inverter? 
What is the significance of this voltage? 

Exercise 3: Glitches 

What is the length of the glitch measured in this exercise? 


Why does this glitch occur, and what is the lesson learned from this exercise?  


Under what conditions is it a bad idea to use a glitchy signal as an input?


4 

Exercise 4: Asynchronous Counters 

Please  draw  a  diagram  showing  the  flip-flop  arrangement  of  a  typical  asynchronous  counter, 
emphasizing the source of each clk input for each flip-flop. 

What  is your measurement for the clk to MSB delay? From this measurement, show calculations 
for the clk-to-q delay for a typical flip-flop in the LS393, and explain the derivation. 

5 

Exercise 5: Synchronous Counter 

Draw a diagram showing the flip-flop arrangement of a typical synchronous counter, emphasizing 
the source of each clk input for each flip-flop. 

How long does it take, after the rising edge of the clock, for one of the flip-flops to change state? 
Does it matter which output bit you choose? Explain 

Show the logic analyzer output to your TA. Can you observe any glitches on RCO? Explain under 
what circumstance you might expect RCO glitches to occur. 

6 

Explain why  the RCO  and ENT  are  connected  between  the  two  counters,  and  explain  how  they 
work. 

What is the difference between the ENT and ENP inputs on a 74LS163? 

Explain  some  differences  between  the 74LS163  and  the 74LS393  in  terms of design and perfor(cid:173)
mance. How many flip-flops and how much logic is required to implement the counter? 

7 

Exercise 6: Set-Reset Latch Construction 

Draw your circuit diagram for the SR Latch. 

Draw the truth table for the SR Latch. 

Explain the functionality of the SR Latch and give an example on how it may be used. 

8 

Exercise 7: Setup Time Measurement of a D Edge-triggered Register 
Explain your solution using relevant diagrams and explanations. 

Explain  the  main  sources  of  error  in  the  measurement  technique  and  potential  differences  with 
datasheets. 

9 

Exercise 8: Writing Combinational Verilog code 

Print out your code for the combinational Verilog code, and be sure to have it ready for checkoff. 
Draw  out  the  7  Karnaugh  maps  corresponding  to  the  different  outputs,  and  generate  the  mini(cid:173)
mized equation, that is, either MPS or MSP as appropriate. Write down the equations below each 
Karnaugh map.
