Problem 4: Transistor/Gate Level Synthesis 
1)  Transistor implementation 

 
2)  NAND gate implementation 

 

 

      

 
 
Problem 5: Setup and Hold times for D Flip-Flop 
1)  The setup time is twice the delay of the inverter, the hold time is zero. 
2)  The new memory element is a negative edge triggered flip-flop. 
3)  The setup time is 2tinv, the hold time is zero, and the clock to Q delay is 2tinv.
