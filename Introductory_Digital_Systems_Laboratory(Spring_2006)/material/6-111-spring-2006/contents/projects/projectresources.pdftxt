Pro ject  Resources 

Pro ject  resources  are  allocated  on  a  per  student  basis.  This  means  that  a  two-person 
pro ject  has  twice  the  resources  that  an  individual  pro ject  has,  etc.  You  have  already  been 
issued a kit and a quantity of ICs.  The following items are available on an individual sign-out 
basis.  Note  that  the  quantities  listed must  suﬃce  for  the  entire  class.

Proto-boards  which  do  not  have  switches,  lights,  or  power  supplies. 
Suitable  5  volt  power  supplies  are  mounted  on  the  lab  benches.  Each 
proto-board  will  hold  about  one-half  the  number  of  ICs  that  can  be 
mounted  on  your  kit. 
50  pin  3M  ribbon  cables  for  kit  to  kit  connections 

The  following  items may  have  to  be  shared.  Cables  for  the  TVs must  be  signed  out  and 
returned  daily. 

14  Monochrome  TV Monitors  with  BNC  cable

15  Color  TV Monitors  with  cable
