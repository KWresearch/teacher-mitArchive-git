Technical Considerations

(cid:132) Synchronization of data
(cid:133) ADV7185 clock vs lab kit 27 MHz clock
(cid:132) Displaying data in VGA
(cid:133) Acquire 240 X 240 real time video
(cid:132) Write data to block memory then continuously read 
from it
(cid:132) Memory Controller
(cid:133) Write a frame worth of data into block memory 
for encoding and transmission

Wireless Transmission
(cid:132) Data is sent serially from the 
labkit to the wireless kit

(cid:132) Data is assembled into packets 
and sent from camera-end to 
fixed-end via CC2420 radio

(cid:132) Data is then sent serially from 
receiver wireless kit to the 
receiver labkit
