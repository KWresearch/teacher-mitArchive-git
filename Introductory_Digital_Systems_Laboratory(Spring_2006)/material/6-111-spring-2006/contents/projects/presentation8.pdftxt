Making the “Smart Flight Vest”

(cid:122) Mount two angular 
rate sensors onto 
the upper body of 
the flight vest
(cid:122) Separate device 
will measure 
throttle

Controlling Throttle

(cid:122) Want functionality of being able to adjust 
and set throttle
(cid:122) Will mount a handle onto resistor arm to 
imitate a throttle lever

ADXRS300 - Angular Rate Sensor

(cid:122) Contains an internal Gyroscope
(cid:122) Output voltage proportional to the 
angular rate about the axis perpendicular 
to the surface of the chip
(cid:122) Range of rate: +/- 300 o/sec
(cid:122) Zero movement: outputs 2.5 V

Getting an Angle from Angular Rate

(cid:122) AngleRate = K * (ADCVoltage-ZeroVoltage)

(cid:122) K is some constant (Degs/sec/volt)

(cid:122) Angle = Angle + AngleRate*deltaT

(cid:122) May need calibration for ZeroVoltage

Interfacing the ADXRS300

(cid:122) Will use an analog to digital converter 
AD7895AN-2
(cid:122) Output of the AD7895 is 12 bits
(cid:122) Uses a reference potential of 2.5 volts  
(cid:122) Serial Output

Interfacing the ADXRS300

(cid:122) Bandwidth of the ADXRS300: 400Hz
(cid:122) Minimum sampling rate for ADC is 
800Hz
(cid:122) We’ll use 10 KHz sampling rate

Timing Operation Diagram

Data Read Operation

(cid:122) AD7895 uses 16 clock cycles to output 
the digital data bits resulting from the 
conversion
(cid:122) It outputs 4 leading zeros, then the 12 
bits of actual data, starting with the 
MSB(DB 11)

determined in Minor FSM

Displaying the State of the Flight

(cid:122) The pilot flying the plane stands in front 
of a monitor that displays the main 
features of an airplane console, including 
an attitude indicator and a display for 
altitude, ascent rate, and velocity.

Displaying numbers

(cid:122) Approach 1- Instantiate rectangles to 
form numbers (similar to how MIT logo 
was made in the Pong game)
(cid:122) Approach 2- Create and store table of 
ASCII characters in memory and render 
characters when they are needed

Attitude Indicator

(cid:122) The Attitude Indicator Module 
takes in two angles (pitch and 
roll).
(cid:122) The roll of the airplane determines 
the slope of the white line 
(horizon) .
(cid:122) The area above is colored blue 
(sky).
(cid:122) The area below is colored brown 
(earth).
(cid:122) The pitch determines the position 
of the horizon.

Attitude Indicator – Algorithm 

(cid:122) The goal is to make 
the horizon shift and 
rotate in response to 
pitch and roll.
(cid:122) When airplane is 
flying “sideways,” a 
different equation is 
used to draw the line 
representing the 
horizon.
