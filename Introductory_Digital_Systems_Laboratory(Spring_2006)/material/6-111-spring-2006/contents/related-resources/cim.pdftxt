Importance of Documentation
(cid:132) Clarifies and fixes ideas and procedures
(cid:132) For designers
(cid:132) For others
(cid:132) Record of project
(cid:132) For further modifications and adaptations
(cid:132) For troubleshooting
(cid:132) For avoiding needless repetition of work

Importance of Precision

(cid:132) Sloppy facts and lack of precision can also 
destroy things
(cid:132) Confusion over units of measure destroyed 
the Mars Lander
(cid:132) Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
thought they were dealing in metricunits -- or 
newtons per second -- when calculating 
spacecraft thrust, 
(cid:132) The Lockheed Martin Corp. team that built the 
system had programmed the measurements in 
English pounds per second. 
(cid:132) The difference took the craft about 60 miles 
off course and into oblivion.

What is a document?
(cid:132) Like your 6.111 Project, a document is 
an artifact that is designed and 
produced
(cid:132) It is created  
(cid:132) For specific purposes
(cid:132) For specific audiences
(cid:132) For specific uses
(cid:132) It is modular

Sample Overview IA
In any business or multi-user environment where 
phone service charges are made on a per call basis, 
it is desirable to keep a log of phone calls so 
individual calls may be charged to the actual callers. 
In addition, it is convenient to be able to dial 
frequently called numbers easily and to redial the last 
number that was dialed. The intent of this project is 
to demonstrate a system which performs these 
functions.

these functions.

Sample  Overview  IB  – User 
Perspective

The user of this system sees an ordinary telephone with a few additional 
switches and indicator lights. The attached keypad produces the 
standard telephone tones. When the user picks up the receiver, she is 
prompted by a light to enter her two digit identification code to gain 
access to the phone system before being prompted to dial a phone
number.  The user may, if she wishes, turn on the “set” switch to set a 
short code. She is then prompted to enter a one digit short code. After 
entering this digit, the user enters a normal phone number. When she is 
done, she turns off the “Set” switch.  The user may dial normally, 
automatically redial the last regularly dialed number by entering a *, or 
may use the autodial function by entering # followed by the short code 
digit. The user may hang up at any time. If the user wishes to place 
another call without reidentifying herself, she may press the pre-redial 
switch.

Sample  Overview  IC  – Additional 
Functions

At any time when the phone is not in use, the phone call 
log may be produced. The “Bill” switch is depressed, 
causing a complete output of all previous calls. The record 
contains the user’s identification code, the date the call 
was made, and the actual number dialed. The day can be 
set to a number from 1 to 366, which specifies the day of 
the year. Two switches are available to change the date: 
one to simply increment the day by one, and the one 
which rapidly increments the counter while the switch is 
depressed.

Sample  Overview  1D  – Summary  of 
Design

The project is divided into two main modules, called the “master” and 
the “slave”. The master monitors the actions of the slave and regulates 
the flow of information to and from the slave. The slave is responsible 
for all the interactions with the use, including auto-dial functions. A key 
element in the project is modularity. The master and the slave can be 
thought of as two semi-independent systems. For instance, the master 
has no way of knowing whether normal dialing or auto-dialing has 
produced a digit. A simple “ready-acknowledge” handshake is used to 
send digits to from the slave to the master. The two modules are in 
reality asynchronous, although for convenience they happen to run off 
the same clock. Because the two systems are modular and 
asynchronous, they can be tested independently.

Sample Overview IE – Advanced 
Organizer

This  document  describes  the  device's  design  and 
performance  specifications  followed  by  the  testing 
and  debugging  procedure  used  in  its  development.  
Two  minor  technical  problems  are  then  noted  and 
recommendations 
for 
further  development  are 
offered.
