Problem Set 5E
Please download the .zip archive for this problem set, and refer to the README.txt ﬁle for
instructions on preparing your solutions.
You will need to submit the grading explanation by Thursday, November 3rd, 11:59PM.
Your grade for Problem 1(p) in Problem Set 5 will be based on both your solutions and the grading
explanation.

Problem 5E-1. Please write a short explanation of your pseudo-code for Problem 1(p) in Problem
Set 5. Assume the grader is familiar with the problem and with the staff solution. If your solution
is very similar to the ofﬁcial solution, please state that, and point out and explain any differences.
If your solution is correct, but very different from the ofﬁcial solution, write a brief explanation to
convince the grader that your solution is correct. If your solution is partially correct, point out the
parts that you got right, and explain your mistakes.
