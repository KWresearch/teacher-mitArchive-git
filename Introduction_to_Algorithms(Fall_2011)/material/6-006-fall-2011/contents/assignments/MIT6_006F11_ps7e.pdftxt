You will need to submit the ps7e_answer.tex ﬁle containing your grading explanation to the
Stellar assignment “Problem Set 7E – LaTeX Template” by Thursday, December 8th, 11:59PM.
Your grade for Problem 2(t) in Problem Set 7 will be based on both your solutions and the grading
explanation.

Problem 7E-1. Please write a short explanation of your pseudo-code for Problem 2(t) in Problem
Set 7. Assume the grader is familiar with the problem and with the staff solution. If your solution
is very similar to the ofﬁcial solution, please state that, and point out and explain any differences.
If your solution is correct, but very different from the ofﬁcial solution, write a brief explanation to
convince the grader that your solution is correct. If your solution is partially correct, point out the
parts that you got right, and explain your mistakes.
