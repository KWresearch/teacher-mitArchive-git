***** Course Description *****
This course covers the fundamental principles, practices and tools of Lean Six
Sigma methods that underlay modern organizational productivity approaches
applied in aerospace, automotive, health care, and other sectors. It includes
lectures, active learning exercises, a plant tour, talks by industry
practitioners, and videos. One third of the course is devoted to a physical
simulation of an aircraft manufacturing enterprise or a clinic to illustrate
the power of Lean Six Sigma methods.
The course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is
a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the
end of the month.
