Department of Emergency Medicine 
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 
Harvard Medical School 

Education: 
MD from University of Copenhagen, Denmark 
Residency in Emergency Medicine at Mayo Clinic, MN 
Fellowship in International Health and Emergency 
Medicine at BIDMC 
MPH from Harvard School of Public Health 

My academic interests include: 
- LEAN implementation in health care organizations 
- Quality improvement and assurance in health care 
- Standardization of health care delivery 
- Development and measurement of performance indicators in Emergency Medicine 
- Development of emergency medicine in countries where the specialty does not exist. 

Internationally we are currently studying the impact of implementing Emergency 
Medicine as a practice model. At BIDMC Iâ€™m actively involved in the LEAN efforts in the 
Emergency Department and have found LEAN to be an incredibly effective tool for 
waste reduction and process standardization.
