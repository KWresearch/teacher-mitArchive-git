***** Course Description *****
This course introduces the fundamental Lean Six Sigma principles that underlay
modern continuous improvement approaches for industry, government and other
organizations. Lean emerged from the Japanese automotive industry, particularly
Toyota, and is focused on the creation of value through the relentless
elimination of waste. Six Sigma is a quality system developed at Motorola which
focuses on elimination of variation from all processes. The basic principles
have been applied to a wide range of organizations and sectors to improve
quality, productivity, customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, time-to-
market and financial performance.
The curriculum corresponds to 24 hours spread over 3 days. The almost 600
slides given to the students, video tapes of many of the lectures, and some of
the active learning exercises are available on MIT OpenCourseWare. Fifty
percent of the contact hours involve hands-on exercises and simulations, most
of which are not available from OCW. An instructor's disk of the complete
curriculum is available for purchase from the LAI_Educational_Network. Other
course supporting materials, including the LegoÂ® enterprise simulations, are
also available for purchase. The course was originally developed for an
aerospace audience at the upper class undergraduate level. Over 10 years, it
has been refined and delivered to over 1,600 students from undergraduate
through professional graduate degree programs, and to seasoned industry
veterans from a diverse range of application domains. It assumes no prior
knowledge of the subject material. For those interested in taking the entire
course, including all of the active learning exercises, it is available through
MIT_Professional_Education for interested groups.
