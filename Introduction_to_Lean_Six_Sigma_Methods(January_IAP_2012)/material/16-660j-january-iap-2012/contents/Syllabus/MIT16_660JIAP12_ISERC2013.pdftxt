Abstract 

 
This  paper  reports  on  a  decade-long  undertaking  to  develop  and  widely  deploy  an  introductory  Lean  Six  Sigma 
curriculum. The  origins,  objectives  and  history  of  the  effort  are  summarized,  as  is  the  content  of  the  core  three-day 
short  course.    Versions  of  the  curriculum  have  been  offered  to  over  1600  participants  in  60  short  course  and 
semester  long  subjects  taught  by  45  different  instructors  in  the  US  and  Latin  America.    Over  180,000  visits  have 
been made  to  the  curriculum  posted  on MIT’s  Open  Courseware.  Findings  on  the  learning  outcomes  are  presented 
based upon the extensive database complied from student feedback and self-assessment.

1. Introduction 
Education  and  training  of  the  workforce  are  essential  enablers  for  the  transformation  and  sustainment  of  any 
enterprise.   Enterprises often develop  their own  internal  training, and may partner with  local or national educational 
institutions  for  development  and  deployment  of  curriculum  relevant  to  their  current  and  future  needs.  In  this  paper 
we  report  on  a  ten  year  undertaking  to  develop  and  deploy  curriculum  in  the  basics  of  lean  thinking  for  audiences 
from  multiple  academic,  industry  and  government  enterprises  spanning  college  through  continuing  education  and 
training.  Although  measuring  the  success  such  an  effort  is  highly  subjective,  instructor  experience  and  student 
feedback  indicates  that participant expectations were met or exceeded. This paper  reports on what was done, why  it 
was done, and what has been learned from this interesting undertaking. 
 
In December 2000, General Lester Lyles, who was then head of the US Air Force Material Command, addressed the 
Lean Aerospace Initiative (LAI) Executive Board. The LAI (later to become the Lean Advancement Initiative) was a 
consortium  of  industry,  government,  and  labor  union  members  funding  MIT  to  help  research  and  enable 
implementation of  lean  thinking  in  the aerospace sector. After noting  the great progress being made on  research and 
implementation  of  lean  thinking  in  the  defense  aerospace  sector,  he  remarked  that  current  and  future  college 
graduates  needed  basic  education  in  this  topic.    His  remarks  were  captured  in  the  following  directive  from  the 
Executive Board to the LAI program leadership, which the lead author directed at that time: 
 

“A curriculum should be developed so that lean principles could be taught at key universities, businesses and 
military institutions across the country and be used for training new members of the acquisition community” 

  
A directive this broad and coming without resources posed a considerable challenge. 

1Murman, McManus, Weigel 

 
LAI’s  response was  to  form  an Educational Network  (EdNet)  comprised of universities with  faculty  that  shared  the 
objective  of  this  directive,  and  who  were  interested  in  pooling  their  resources  to  develop  and  deploy  basic  lean 
thinking  curriculum.   Each EdNet member  signed  a No Cost Collaborative Agreement with MIT,  pledging  to  share 
intellectual  property  and  agreeing  to  some  basic  governance  principles.  Initially  there  were  6-8  US  members.  By 
2013 there were 70 member schools with 50% being international. 
 
At  their  initial  meeting  in  March  of  2003,  the  EdNet  members  agreed  to  collaborate  on  developing  a  “Lean  101” 
short  course,  and  deploying  it  as  quickly  as  possible  to  audiences  of  summer  interns  in  the  LAI  member 
organizations.  The approach would be for faculty to pool their knowledge, instructional exercises, exhibits and time 
to  develop  a  common  course  which  they  would  then  collaboratively  teach  each  summer.  Each  faculty  member 
would  integrate  this curriculum, or  fragments of  it,  into  their campus offerings  in whatever way made  sense  to  their 
local  situation.  The  course  would  be  five  days  in  duration  to  give  about  the  same  contact  hours  as  a  semester  on 
campus. The  first  offering was  to  20  summer  interns  at Rolls Royce  Indianapolis  in  June  2003. By  the  end  of  2012 
there  have  been  60  courses  offered  to  over  1600  participants  in  four  countries  involving  45  instructors  from  27 
institutions.    This  rest  of  this  paper  presents  an  overview  of  this  undertaking,  a  summary  of  the  main  course,  and 
what has been learned from the experience. 
 
2. LAI Lean Academy Overview 
The  principles  and  tools  of  lean  thinking  emanate  from 
actual  practices  observed  in  organizations  that  strive  for 
customer  satisfaction,  continuous  improvement,  worker 
involvement,  and  respect  for  people.   John  Shook  of  the 
Lean  Enterprise  Institute  depicts  the  appropriate  roles  of 
classroom  and  On  the  Job  Training  (OJT)  or  On  the  Job 
Doing  (OJD)  for  lean  learning,  as  shown  in  Figure  1  [1].  
Basic  lean  knowledge  is  best  gained  in  the  classroom. 
This  can  provide  scaffolding 
for  building  one’s 
knowledge  through  more  experiential  OJT  learning.  
Higher  levels  of  ability  can  be  aided  by  classroom 
experiences,  with  decreasing  effectiveness  for  increasing 
learning  levels.  Classroom  curriculum  and  pedagogy 
requires appropriate experiential content  to contribute  to higher  levels of ability.   Although Shook’s figure appeared 
well  after  the LAI Lean Academy  effort  started,  it  accurately  portrays  the  underlying  philosophy  of  the  curriculum, 
which is learner centric and rich with experiential learning content.

learning modes 

The  core  of  the  LAI  Lean  Academy  curriculum  is  a  day-long  Lego™ 
aircraft  production  simulation  that  provides  a  carefully  designed  “practice 
field”  to  apply  lean  principles  for  improving  enterprise  performance.  
Outcome data presented in Section 4 supports the learning effectiveness of 
this  hands-on  experiential  representation  for  grasping  and  applying  the 
basic  lean  thinking  concepts  and  tools.  Other  modules  in  the  course 
introduce  various  lean  concepts,  some  of  which  are  applied  in  the  Lego 
simulation  and  others  that  are  not.    Through  experience  with  various 
versions of the curriculum, it was found that a 50/50 mix of active learning 
and  didactic  lecture  material  provided  good  learning  outcomes.    The 
overall  time  budget  for  the  current  version  of  the  course  presented  in 
Section  3  is  shown  in  Figure  2.    Other  than  the  Lego  simulation,  active  learning  content  of  modules  ranges  from 
33%  to  66%  of  the  contact  time.  The  effectiveness  of  these  simulations  and  exercises  has  been  reported  earlier  by 
McManus  et  al  [2,  3]  and  Candido  et  al  [4].   Other  best  practices  from  the  learning  literature  such  as  carefully 
constructed learning objectives and reflective assessments have been utilized throughout the course. 
 
The LAI Lean Academy  effort  started  soon  after  publication  of  Lean Enterprise Value  [5]  by  the LAI  team.  In  that 
work,  the  authors  articulate  that  the  application  of  lean  thinking  can  achieve  its  full  potential  only  if  lean  principles 
are  applied  across  all  enterprise  functions.    This  finding  drove  the  content  of  the  LAI  Lean  Academy  towards  an 
enterprise perspective. There are many courses on lean manufacturing or lean supply chain management, but few on

lean  enterprise  principles.    Being  an  introductory  course,  a  careful  balance  needed  to  be  struck  between  high  level 
enterprise topics and lower level hands on tools and techniques to meet the needs of the intended audiences – college 
level  students  and  professionals  who  had  no  prior  Lean  exposure.   The  curriculum  resulting  from  the  effort  was 
branded  as  the  LAI  Lean  Academy™  and  trademarked  for  quality  control  purposes.  The  initial  examples  and 
simulations  in  the course reflected  the aerospace basis of  the LAI.   As  the course became more widely deployed  the 
content was broadened.   Starting  in 2009, a  thrust was  initiated  to develop a healthcare version. The current version 
of  the  course  covered  in  Section  3  is  a  balance  of  healthcare  and  aerospace  with  examples  from  other  fields  when 
appropriate exhibits or exercises can be found.  The course has proven effective to a wide range of audiences.  
 
2.1 Evolution of the LAI Lean Academy 
 

2012 
 
After  a  very  positive  outcome  from  the  first  offering  in  2003,  the  instructors  decided  to  aggressively  pursue 
curriculum  improvement and expanding  the  instructor corps  to prepare  for  future summer offerings.   During 2004 – 
2006,  yearly  courses  were  offered  in  January  for  future  instructors  who  would  teach  the  course  the  following 
summer.  These  participants  were  then  involved  in  improving  the  curriculum  they  would  be  delivering.  Through 
developing  and  then  teaching  the  course,  they  took  ownership  of  the  content  and  started  to  deploy  it  in  their  home 
institutions. Several of  the LAI member companies offered  the courses, mostly  to  their newly hired staff  rather  than 
to  summer  interns. A  yearly Deming-type  improvement  cycle was  established;  leading  to  seven  distinct  versions  of 
the course over the ten years it has existed.  
 
There were  two major  changes  that  occurred  in  2007.    The  first was  numerous  requests  to  shorten  the  course  from 
five days to three. The second was LAI members’ declining interest in offering the full course; instead, they favored 
using  internal  training materials  (in some cases augmented by LAI materials).    In addition,  the many  teams  that had 
developed  different  parts  of  the  curriculum  led  to  inconsistencies  in  module  organization,  terminology,  formatting 

3Murman, McManus, Weigel 
and  fonts,  and  speaker  notes.  From  2007  to  2008,  emphasis  shifted  to  redevelopment  and  testing  of  a  three-day 
course  with  consistency  across  all  modules,  full  instructor  notes,  and  examples  broadened  beyond  aerospace.  
Deployment  strategy  shifted  from  LAI  companies  to  campus  venues,  often  led  by  instructors  who  had  taught  the 
courses during the first three years. The course was offered through MIT’s continuing education summer program to 
practicing  professionals,  and  academics  seeking  access  the  curriculum.  The  course  was  offered  to MIT  students  in 
January 2008, which made it eligible for posting on MIT’s Open Courseware the following year.   
 
During  2009,  a  lean  healthcare  course  was  developed  and  successfully  tested  with  an  audience  of  40  Veteran 
Administration  professionals. This  eventually  led  to  a  new  version  of  the LAI Lean Academy,  described  in  Section 
3,  which  can  be  taught  as  separate  or  integrated  Healthcare  or  Enterprise  versions.  2009  also  saw  the  first  offering 
outside  the  US  in  Puebla,  Mexico.    Two  years  later,  a  full  Spanish  translation  of  the  curriculum  was  made  by 
Seminarium Internacional and Universidad Católica de Chile. 
 
By  the  end  of  2012,  versions  of  the  LAI  Lean  Academy  curriculum  had  been  offered  60  times  to  over  1600 
participants  by  45  different  instructors.  The  three  authors  have  collectively  instructed  versions  of  the  course  58 
times,  some  as  a  team  and many with  other  instructors.  The Open  Courseware website  [6]  had  184,376  visits  in  3-
1/2 years, with over 200,000 viewings of the module videos.  Version 7 of the course described in Section 3 contains 
600  PowerPoint  slides  with  speaker  notes,  a  dozen  simulations  or  exercises,  a  video  plant  tour  and  several  video 
lectures by enterprise leaders, as well as a full suite of instructor notes, course evaluation tools, and other supporting 
materials.  The  accompanying  glossary  has  105  entries  for  terms  introduced  in  the  curriculum.  A  full  Spanish 
Enterprise version  is available.   The LAI Lean Academy has been  taught as a  three-day  short course and a  semester 
long  campus  course  to  audiences  of  up  to  67  participants.  A  separate  Lean  Product  Development  course  has  been 
offered  at  MIT,  and  one-day  workshop  versions  of  the  health  care  and  product  development  courses  have  been 
tested. Intellectual property licenses allow the curriculum to be deployed for any non-commercial educational use. 
 
2.2 VALUE and VALUE PIL Self Assessments 
It  quickly  became  apparent  that  a  method  was  needed  to  assess  and  articulate  student  learning.  Traditional  graded 
assessment  methods  are  not  suitable  for  short  courses,  nor  did  the  Six  Sigma  colored  belt  credentials  seem 
appropriate. Instead, an easily administered self-assessment method was introduced, the Virtual Assessment of Lean 
User  Experience  or  VALUE.  A  version  called  the  VALUE  PIL  (Proficiency  Index  Level)  was  introduced  for  the 
healthcare  option.    Both  follow  the  same  methodology,  but  have  some  detail  differences  in  the  knowledge  areas.  
The  self-assessment  is  administered  before  and  after  the  course.    The  tool  is  also  suitable  for  measuring  increased 
proficiency as the participant applies their learning in the workplace.  However, it has not been possible to track this 
progress  due  to  the  dispersion  of  participants  after  taking  the  course.    One  attempt  was  made  to  get  such  data  for 
participants all within a single company, but even that was not possible.

Participant  proficiency  is  divided  into  the 
six levels shown in Table 2.  Five are akin 
to  Shook’s  five  levels  (Fig.  1).  A  sixth 
UNAWARE  level  was  included  to  aid  in 
  Advancing  to 
pre-course  evaluation. 
higher 
levels  of  proficiency 
takes 
progressively  greater  exposure  to,  and 
experience with the subject matter. 
 
The  assessment  is  applied  to  knowledge 
areas  representing  clusters  of  the  course  content:  twelve  for  the  VALUE  and  ten  for  the  VALUE  PIL  tool.  The 
actual  VALUE  worksheet  is  shown  in  the  Appendix.  On  the  left  are  rubrics  for  each  proficiency  level.  The  right 
column displays knowledge area clusters and topics covered in the course. Three pages of instruction accompanying 
the  tool  were  designed  to  help  mitigate  the  possibility  that  participants  might  have  deflated  or  inflated  opinions  of 
their proficiency. Outcome data from this self-assessment will be presented in Section 4.   
 
The  LAI  Lean  Academy  assumes  the  participant  has  no  prior  knowledge,  i.e.  is  UNAWARE.    Learning  objectives 
are designed for a participant to complete the short course with a proficiency of at least READY but not higher than 
CAPABLE. This is in line with Shook’s assessment (Fig. 1) that application is needed for greater proficiency.

3. LAI Lean Academy Curriculum 
The curriculum progresses  from  introduction of  lean  fundamentals  on day 1,  to application of  lean  fundamentals on 
day  2,  to  quality  and  six  sigma  basics,  an  accounts  payable  case  study,  and  implementation  on  day  3.  Several 
concepts  are  reinforced  throughout  the  curriculum:  value  stream  mapping  and  analysis  (VSMA);  identifying  and 
eliminating  waste;  continuous  improvement  Plan-Do-Study-Act  (PDSA)  cycles;  data  driven  structured  problem 
solving; respect for people; and that Lean is a journey.  
 
3.1 Day 1 – Basic Lean Fundamentals of Continuous Process Improvement and Respect for People 
The  first  day’s  topics  cover:  the  origins  and  basics  of  Lean  and  Six  Sigma;  implementation  examples  from  various 
sectors;  the  five  fundamental  principals  of  lean  thinking  [7]  including  various  forms  of  waste;  process  mapping; 
VSMA;  topics  such  as  kanban,  5/6S,  5  whys,  balanced  work,  takt  time;  relational  coordination  [8,9];  integrated 
teams,  and more. The  day  includes  a  plant  tour  to  see Lean  in  action.  If  the  logistics  overhead  of  this  precludes  the 
preferred actual tour, a video tour of the New Balance shoe factory in Lawrence MA is used.   
 
Besides  the plant  tour, active  learning  includes: a short and effective 6S exercise  in  the opening module; analysis of 
a  hot  dog  stand  operation  which  includes  process mapping,  waste  identification,  takt  time,  cycle  time,  value  added 
and  non  value  added  time,  balanced  work,  and  VSMA;  an  exercise  on  job  satisfaction;  and  a  team  building  class 
debate on early vs. “fast follower” adoption of lean. Emphasis is given to fundamental concepts and tools rather than 
training  on  a  specific  approach.  This  is  illustrated  in  Figure  3  which  shows  hot  dog  stand  process  maps  from  four 
different teams, making the point that there is no “right way” to do the map.  Overall, 47% of the contact time on the 
first day is devoted to active learning.

3.2 Day 2 – Application of Lean Fundamentals with Lego™ simulations 
The Lego simulation with accompanying lecture materials for the second day result in over 60% of the contact hours 
being devoted to active learning. The basic version of the course (called the Enterprise version) utilizes a Lego 
airplane production enterprise while the Healthcare version adopts clinics that treat Lego patients. The simulations 
are structurally similar. Participants are process owners and the simulation mechanics constrain them to achieve 
performance improvement through process improvement, rather than through personal heroism or gaming the 
system.  Process capability is represented with sand timers, and variability is introduced through die rolls. In the first 
segment of each simulation, participants are given a poorly performing enterprise with multiple sources of waste and 
unbalanced work.  After a round to learn the simulation mechanics, just-do-it improvements can be made using 
techniques such as 6S, standardizing, visual control, and some pure waste elimination. The second segment of each 
simulation utilizes VSMA and structured root cause analysis to redesign their enterprise process to eliminate 
bottlenecks and non-value-added steps. The final segment of each simulation addresses ”enterprise” issues outside 
the immediate control of each group.  For both simulations, budgets are allocated for process improvement options 
selected by the team from multiple possibilities, and metrics are tracked to monitor 
performance improvement.   
 
During the enterprise Lego aircraft production simulation, 5-6 participant teams 
comprise four assembly plants at a single table, and a supplier representative who 
procures parts from a remote supplier located across the room.  In the first 12 
minute round, enterprises can only produce 1-2 aircraft (Fig. 4), even after simple 
6S and process standardization improvement. Difficulty in getting the right parts at 

Figure 4 - Lego airplane

Figure 5 - Lego patients  

Murman, McManus, Weigel 
the right time leads into a 45 minute lecture and exercise on Lean Supply Chain Basics (kanban, paperless ordering, 
supplier involvement) which are then applied during the second segment, along with work rebalancing and 
standardization driven by a simplified VSMA exercise.  Further improvement requires parts reduction which tees up 
a 45 minute lecture and exercise on Lean Engineering basics, emphasizing the point that only so much progress can 
be made before one encounters constraints external to one’s part of the organization. Airplanes undergo a 
constrained redesign, and further efficiencies are introduced with balanced and standard work. In the final 12 minute 
round, enterprises produce 10-12 aircraft to meet customer demand. They and their supplier report on their financial 
performance as well as implementation lessons learned. 
 

Clinics of 5-6 participants process Lego patients (Fig. 5) in the healthcare 
simulation, moving them from registration through triage, examination, diagnosis 
and discharge.  The color of patients’ heads, torso and legs determine treatment 
pathways.  Simulation mechanics are learned in the first segment and just-do-it 
improvements are implemented, but only 1-2 patients can be treated in a 12 
minute round, even with allowed “overtime.” Lecture material and exercises 
between the first and second segments cover structured problem solving based on 
Sobek and Smalley [10] and VSMA. Improvements are implemented and 
evaluated in the second simulation segment, but some patients remain untreated 
due to lack of diagnostic capability in each clinic. For the third segment, groups 
of clinics must work together as a healthcare system to treat all the patients, and a 
Lego version of electronic medical records are also introduced. Instructional 
material on Rapid Process Improvement Workshops (RPIW) and Daily Management Systems provide the means to 
implement the needed process improvements. Networks of 2-3 clinics are able to treat 10 patients/clinic in the final 
round, without overtime or untreated patients, while reducing errors and patient wait times.  
 
3.3 Day 3 – Case Study, Quality and Six Sigma Basics, Variation, and Lean Implementation 
Day 3 provides an opportunity to explore several additional topics to further build the participants’ understanding of 
Lean and Six Sigma.  An opening module uses case study pedagogy to learn that VSMA, RPIW and other lean 
concepts apply equally well to office processes, using a real accounts payable processes from an LAI member 
company. The case study is quantitatively rich, which can be a difficult change of pace after the tactile Lego 
simulations the previous day. Two additional modules build upon the case study. One introduces A3 problem 
solving with an exercise to complete an A3 sheet for implementing the case study recommendations.  Another 
module focuses on the impact of variation on throughput, using a dice and poker chip simulation of a variable, but 
otherwise perfectly balanced and linear, process.  An equivalent computer simulation and queuing theory formula 
help deepen the participant’s understanding of the impact of variation. 
 
Finding the right level of depth for modules addressing 
quality and six sigma basics proved to be a challenge 
given the constrained amount of time available in a 
three day course.  The final versions of these modules 
have been well received by beginners in these areas. 
Quality Tools and Topics uses a simple exercise to 
illustrate the difficulty of inspecting in quality, and then 
turns to the relationship of Lean and TQM before 
introducing the seven quality tools.  Six Sigma Basics 
has an extensive statistical process control (SPC) 
simulation in the context of a pharmacy dispensing 
doses of a white bean “medicine.” This rich, but 
facilitation-intensive exercise covers control charting 
and cause and effect root cause analysis (Fig. 6) in an 
engaging way. The day concludes with one or more 
capstone talks from invited speakers, recounting their enterprise’s lean journey. These talks are sometimes replaced 
with a video, although students generally find this much less engaging than the chance to talk to a real enterprise 
leader. Not including these talks, 52% of the contact hours on the third day are devoted to active learning exercises.

4. LAI Lean Academy Outcomes 
The  outcomes  presented  in  this  section  are  all  based  upon  structured  student  assessments  and  feedback  forms.  As 
such,  they  represent  the  effectiveness  of  the  learning  as  perceived  by  the  students.  Although  there  are  limits  to 
judging  outcomes  based  on  student  assessments,  the  large  amount  of  information  that  has  been  amassed  over many 
offerings to multiple audiences is rich source of data. 
 
4.1 Self-assessed Student Learning 
VALUE  self-assessment  data  (see Sec.  2.2) was  collected  since 
2004  for  all  3  and  5  day  courses,  on-campus  semester  long 
offerings,  and  two  train-the-trainer  versions.  Each  participant 
was  requested  to  submit  a  pre  and  post  course  assessment  for 
each  of  the  12  knowledge  areas. Collected  data was  incomplete 
for some of  the courses and was  lost for others.   However, even 
with  that,  a  large  amount  of  very  useful  data  is  available.

One  would  expect  that  offering  the  same  curriculum 
spread  over  a  regular  semester  course  would  lead  to 
deeper  understanding  and  greater  proficiency.    Figure 
10  compares  outcomes  for  6  semester  offerings  at USC, Northeastern,  and MIT  to  192  students with  8  short  course 
offerings  to  211  Rolls  Royce  interns,  MIT  and  U  of  Missouri  Rolla  students.    The  semester  long  offerings  were 
taught  by  veteran  short  course  instructors,  and  had  additional  homework  and  project  assignments.  The  statistically 
significant  data  (p<0.05)  shows  that  students  perceived  a  significantly  greater  gain  in  proficiency  from  a  semester 
long offering.

4.2 Instructional Effectiveness 
Students  fill  out  a  simple  survey  each  day  responding  to  the  statement  "The  instruction  helped  me  to  achieve  the 
learning  objectives  of  the  module,”  with  possible  responses  of  Strongly  Disagree,  Disagree,  Neutral,  Agree,  and 
Strongly Agree.    They  are  also  asked  for  comments  on  “What could we have done better  today?”  and  What did we 
do  really well  today?”  Survey  results  have  been  used  to  highlight  problems,  improve  (or  in  some  cases  eliminate) 
underperforming modules, and identify successful  instruction strategies.   Some findings are discussed here based on 
survey results from all 18 three-day courses for which data was available.  Of the 550 students in these classes, 97% 
provided data for at least one module. 
 
Figure  11  shows  the  responses  divided  by  various modes  of  instruction. The Lego™  simulations were  judged  to  be 
highly effective. Lectures with varying levels of active learning content were judged less effective, but still excellent 
with  about  90%  of  the  responses  in  the  top  two  choices. No  correlation was  found  between  level  of  active  learning 
content  and  perceived  module  effectiveness.  No  statistical  difference  was  found  between  students'  reception  of 
experienced  based  talks  by  experts  and  regular  lecture  modules,    nor  was  any  statistical  difference  found  between 
hearing such  talks by  live experts versus hearing  them on video.   On  the other hand, factory  tours were perceived  to 
be more effective  than  lectures at  the p<0.05  level of  significance, while video  tours were not.   Figure 12  illustrates 
that students perceive the overall instruction to be more effective than professionals (p<0.1) and young professionals 
(p<0.01). This is not surprising given that they were the original targets of the course.

learning objectives, by instruction type.

learning objectives, by cohort. 

 
This  data  has  been  used  as  part  of  the  continuous  improvement  of  the  curriculum.  Figure  13  shows  the  aggregate 
effectiveness of the various modules, using the percent of Strongly Agreed responses as an approximate metric. This 
kind  of  chart  is  used  to  monitor  the  effectiveness  of  the  modules  and  identify  problem  areas.  Figure  14,  which 
include  data  from  the  earlier  5-day  version  of  the  class,  tracks  the  performance  of  an  individual module  (the  VSM 
module)  over  time.  The  VSM  module  was  selected  for  this  illustration  as  it  was  found  to  be  a  difficult  subject  to 
teach  in  limited  time,  and  was  continuously  worked  on  by  the  instructors  in  the  early  years  of  the  academy.  
Improvements  are  seen  from  2005  to  2006,  when  more  time  was  dedicated  to  the  subject,  but  in  2007  it  was 
disrupted by compression of  the material  into a 3-day format.   This was successfully overcome by a retooling of  the 
module  around  an  active  learning  exercise.    The  trend  since  then  has  been  a  steady  decline,  indicating  the  module 
may now need a refresh.

5. Summary 
This  paper  summarizes  a  decade-long  undertaking  to  develop  and  widely  deploy  introductory  Lean  Six  Sigma 
curriculum.    A  2001  directive  from  the  Lean  Aerospace  Initiative  Executive  Board  to  accomplish  this  was  met  by 
engaging  a  large  number  of  academics  and  practitioners  in  the  LAI  Educational  Network.  Various  versions  of 
curriculum  they  developed  (Enterprise,  Healthcare  and  Product  Development)  have  been  offered  to  over  1600 
college  through  professional  participants  during  60  short  courses  and  semester  offerings  in  the  US  and  Latin 
America  taught  by  45  different  instructors.    The  core  three-day  curriculum  is  comprised  of  a  dozen  exercises  or 
simulations,  600  PowerPoint  slides,  a  case  study,  several  videos  and  a  robust  set  of  instructor  notes  and  supporting 
materials.  The  Enterprise  version  of  the  curriculum  presented  in  this  paper  has  been  translated  into  Spanish.  An 
earlier Enterprise version posted on MIT’s Open Courseware has had 184,376 visitors in 3-1/2 years. 
 
Student self-assessments of lean proficiency before and after the course as well as feedback on each module provide 
a  large  database  to  extract  findings  from  this  undertaking.  These  can  be  useful  for  future  curriculum  development, 
including those directed towards online versions.  Highlights from the presented findings include: 
•  An  overall  50/50  mix  of  active  learning  and  didactic  lecture  contact  hours  provided  effective  learning. 
Some  exercises  may  be  easily  adapted  to  online  delivery,  and  could  possibly  be  enhanced  with  larger 
audience  participation  such  as  through  instantaneous  class  polling  or  self-organized  local  study  groups. 
However team simulations using Legos or other physical devices and live plant tours will be a challenge for 
online learning. Yet they have proven to be the most effective of all the learning modalities employed. 
•  Student  lean  proficiency  after  completing  the  short  course  achieved  the  targeted  level  based  upon  the 
learning  objectives,  and  adequately  prepared  them  for  participating  in  lean  improvement  projects  in  their 
current  or  future  employment.  The  post-course  proficiency  was  statistically  the  same  for  both  the  current 
three-day  course  and  the  original  five-day  course.    Post-course  proficiency  was  statistically  the  same 
whether  the  participant  was  an  on  campus  undergraduate  or  graduate  student,  a  recent  graduate,  or  a 
seasoned professional.  
•  Versions of  the course offered on campus over a  full  semester with additional homework and projects  lead 
to  statistically  significant greater post  course proficiency,  as would be  expected. Data presented provides  a 
quantitative  measure  of  this  increased  learning.  This  data  might  be  valuable  to  those  deciding  whether  to 
offer or take a short course versus a semester course for credit.
