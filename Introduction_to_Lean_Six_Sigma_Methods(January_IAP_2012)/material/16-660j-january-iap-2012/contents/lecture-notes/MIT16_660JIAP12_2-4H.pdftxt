Improving the Enterprise 

Learning Objectives 
At the end of this module, you will be able to: 
• Recognize that enterprise improvement requires more 
than “local lean thinking” 
• Describe how lean organizations are able to adapt to 
external constraints and disruptive events 
• Participate in a Rapid Process Improvement 
Workshop to achieve larger-scale lean improvements 
• Implement a Daily Management System  
• Describe some of the difficulties of large-scale change 
• Explain a future state map for a process

Enterprise Issues 

• HC operations are often impacted by 
decisions made at higher enterprise levels 
• Regulations, insurance, billing… 
• Resource constraints and performance 
demands 
• HC networks need (ultimately) to be optimized 
at an enterprise level 
• With poor coordination, local optimization may 
sub-optimize the enterprise (and vice-versa) 
• Done right, enterprise resources and removal of 
enterprise constraints may allow much greater 
efficiencies at the local level

Constraints and 
Disruptions 
• Higher level decisions and systems may 
appear as constraints to local attempts at lean 
• Billing and paperwork requirements 
• Hiring rules, credentialing requirements 
• Budget cutbacks 
• Higher level improvements may appear as 
disruptions to local attempts at stable process 
• EMR 
• Consolidations, HC networks 
• Changes in insurance or law

Living with change 
• Lean organizations are, by their nature, 
adaptable to change 
• Process orientation allows efficient process 
change and quicker stabilization 
• Standardization means fewer things have to 
change (i.e. change and train the standard, not 
many individual processes) 
• Rapid cycle time means changes take effect 
quicker 
• Continuous improvement culture means people 
are practiced at change, know how to minimize 
disruptions, quickly stabilize the new state 
Higher level change requires greater levels of 
organization and planning

Stakeholder Value 

  “Value - how various stakeholders find particular 
worth, utility, benefit, or reward in exchange for 
their respective contributions to the enterprise.”  
Murman et al., Lean Enterprise Value, Palgrave, 2002

Visualizing: The Ideal State 

• “Giving customers exactly what they want, 
when they want it, is a core principle of an ideal 
state. As you observe work in progress, note 
the delays in care created by caregivers waiting 
for necessities from their suppliers (…). It is 
easy to see the delay passed onto the patient 
and the costs passed onto the organization”* 
 
• An Ideal State Map is often a useful exercise for 
determining what directions improvements 
should follow. 
* Cindy Jimmerson, Value Stream Mapping for Healthcare Made Easy

Rapid Process Improvement 
Workshop (RPIW) 

• Focused on a specific improvement 
opportunity 
• Chartered by a sponsor who gives 
improvement goals and organizational 
constraints, and provides resources 
• Lean coaches & facilitators provided 
• Event is up to a week in duration 
• Several months preplanning 
• Involves all important stakeholders 
• Data driven process 
• Ends with implementation plan 
• Implemented outcomes measured
