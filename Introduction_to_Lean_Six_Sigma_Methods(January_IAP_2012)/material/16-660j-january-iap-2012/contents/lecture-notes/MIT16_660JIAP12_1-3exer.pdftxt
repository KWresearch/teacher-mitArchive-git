 

S & A Hot Dogs 
 
Time Exercise
  
 
Sasha and Andy have opened a hot dog stand at their local park.  They offer a hot dog with 
choice of fresh fruit and beverage to walk up customers between 10 AM and 2 PM. Customers 
put on their own condiments. Customers say their hot dogs are good, but the wait is a little 
long.  
 
After two weeks, they have a brisk, and growing business. Andy and Sasha notice they are 
barely keeping up with the customer demand, and making a little money after buying their 
supplies at the end of each day.  They would like to improve their process to meet growing 
customer demand.   They collected the following average data for their business processes 
and need help analyzing it.  
 

T/O*  

 
* T/O = Time per order in seconds.  Include rework time.  
 
As a first step, they have asked that you draw a process map for the above 11 Process Steps 
listed in the left hand columns. Later you will work with the data.
