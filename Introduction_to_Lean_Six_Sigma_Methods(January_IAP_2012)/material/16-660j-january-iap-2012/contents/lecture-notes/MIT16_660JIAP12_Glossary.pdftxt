LAI Lean Academy Glossary v7.6
 

 

 
Description 
A process of asking “why?” five times in a row to get to 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
the root cause for something. Five is a guideline or rule 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of thumb. Sometimes fewer or more questions are 
needed. 5 Whys is not a unique process. Different 
 
 
 
   
   
people may arrive at different root causes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sort, Straighten, Scrub, Standardize, Sustain. 
  
 
 
 
 
A disciplined approach to improve workplace efficiency 
 
 
 
 
 
by eliminating non-value added clutter and materials, 
 
 
 
 
making it easy for workers to find just what they need, 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
just when they need it.  The original Japanese 5S terms 
 
are Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu, and Shitsuke. 
 
 
 
 
 
Various translations into English are found, each 
 
 
 
 
 
keeping S as the first letter. There is an implied 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
progression to start with the first S and move towards 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the final S. 
 
 
Americans added Safety to 5S, and there are various 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
versions of where Safety fits and its actual verbiage. 
 
 
 
 
 
The LAI Lean Academy uses Sort, Safe, Straighten, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Scrub, Standardize, and Sustain. 
  
 
 
 
Categories of waste (muda) used to help identify non-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
valued added activities: overproduction, inventory, 
transportation, unnecessary movement, waiting, 
 
 
 
 
defective outputs, over processing, unused employee 
 
 
 
 
 
creativity. The first seven originated from Toyota. The 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
eighth was added, realizing that non-engagement of 
 
 
 
employees in continuous process improvement was a 
 
 
 
waste of human resources. Variations of these 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
wordings are found. 
Named for the A3 size of paper (approx 11” x 17”) used 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to capture an improvement plan.  A3 is both a tool (a 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
formatted piece of paper) and a way of thinking about 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
continuous process improvement. 
Another name for processing time, the time that work is 
 
 
 
 
 
 
being done on a task. 
   
 
 
 
A specific visual control device, usually a set of red-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
yellow-green lights, to show the current status of a 
process station. 
    
 
Having the time for each step of a multistep process be 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
approximately the same as the overall takt time to 
enable smooth flow with no bottlenecks.

Description 
 
 
The practice of a given work station processing multiple 
 
 
 
 
 
 
units at one time (a batch), placing the outputs into a 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
buffer (a queue) for the next step in the workflow. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An activity of visiting operations external to the 
organization to observe their work practices to help in 
 
 
 
 
 
 
determining best practices. 
 
 
 
 
The activity with the greatest utilization or load. In a 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
balanced work process, there are no bottlenecks. 
 
 
 
 
 
The maximum sustainable flow rate or throughput of an 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
activity.  Actual capacity takes into account detractors 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
that reduce the theoretical throughput. 
A graphical technique used on value stream maps that 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
has alternating high and low flats, thereby looking like a 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rampart. Touch times for an activity are put on the low 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or high flat and wait times between activities on the 
 
 
 
 
other flat. It is both a visual display as well as an 
 
 
 
 
   
   
enabler for rapid calculation of total end-to-end touch 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and wait times for a process. 
A root cause analysis tool to help identify the cause(s) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of a particular event. The event is put at the “head” of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the fishbone and the spines are used to group possible 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
causes into categories.  Frequently used categories are 
Measurement, Personnel, Materials, Methods, 
 
 
 
 
Environment, and Machines. Also called Ishikawa or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fishbone diagrams. 
 
 
 
A production unit organized so that the separate 
 
 
 
 
 
 
workstations for each production step are organized in 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a U shape layout to enable communication and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
coordination. Workers can visually see the whole 
 
 
 
 
 
production flow. The output of one step is immediately 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
delivered to the next step, which is adjacent. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Check sheets are structured tools for collecting data in 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
a disciplined way.  A typical format is a matrix with cells 
 
 
 
 
 
for entering data for the particular row/column 
 
 
 
 
instances, e.g. temperature (column A) and blood 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
pressure (column B) for a patient at hour H (row).  A 
checklist is a simplified check sheet with even more 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
structure.  Listed items are ticked off as they are 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
executed to assure that no steps have been omitted.

Description 
 
 
The sum of many “chances causes,” none traceable to 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a single major cause. Common cause variation is 
 
 
 
 
 
essentially the noise in the system. When a process is 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 
 
operating subject to common cause variation it is in a 
state of statistical control. 
 
 
 
 
 
The use of plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles to 
 
 
 
 
continuously improve a given process in the pursuit of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
perfection. 
A plot of a measured quantity (input or output) versus 
   
 
 
 
 
 
time (hour, day, month, etc. or sample number), 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
together with the average or mean value and Upper and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lower Control Limits (UCL, LCL). Control charts provide 
 
 
 
 
 
 
information about the stability/predictability of the 
 
 
 
 
 
process, specifically with regard to its central tendency 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(to target value) and variation. 
 
 
An enterprise (see definition) and other entities tightly 
 
 
 
 
integrated through direct or partnering agreements. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The cost associated with poor quality, including direct 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
costs (scrap & rework, service calls, warranties & 
 
 
 
concessions) and indirect costs (excess inventory, 
 
 
 
overtime, non valued added steps, queues & delays, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
loss of image or reputation). 
A term used to define the capability of a centered 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
process. It is mathematically expressed 
 
   
 
 
by: 

A term used to define the capability of an off centered

See definition for continuous process improvement 
 
The “as is” state of a given process as represented by a 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
current state value stream map. 
 
 
 
The recipient of the output of a process. An external 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
customer generally pays for the deliverable. For an 
 
 
 
 
 
internal customer, the output becomes the input for a 
 
 
 
 
 
 
downstream process. 
 
 
Coefficient of variation defined as the standard 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
deviation divided by the average value.

LAI Lean Academy Glossary v7.6
 
 
Description 
 
 
The time required to execute all the activities in a 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
process.  Other names include lead time or span time 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or throughput time. Cycle time includes processing time 
 
 
 
 
 
and wait time. 
 
Any process output that does not meet the customer’s 
 
 
 
 
 
specifications. 
 
Design for manufacturing and assembly – a set of 
 
 
     
 
 
 
 
practices used during design to assure the component 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or product can be economically manufactured and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
assembled. One DFMA practice is reduction of part 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
count. 
 
Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control. DMAIC is 
 
 
 
the six sigma process improvement cycle.

supplier to the customer’s customer. 
 
 
 
Another name for cause and effect diagram. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) Specify value; (2) Identify the value stream; (3) 
 
 
 
 
Make value flow continuously; (4) Let customers pull

A diagram representing a process or algorithm, showing 
 
 
   
 
 
 
each process step in a {box, triangle, diamond, 
 
   
 
 
bubble…} connected to other {boxes…} with lines 
 
 
 
showing flow of {material, information}.  Incoming 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
{material, information} is from “suppliers” while outgoing 
 
 
 
{material, information} is sent to “customers” for the 
 
 
 
 
 
process. 
A desired new state of a given process. 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
The place where work is being done. 
 
 
 
The act of going to the gemba to observe the actual 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
work being done and talking to the actual people doing 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the work. 
 
A graphical representation of the distribution of a set of 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
data in ranges of the independent variable, or “bins”, 
 
 
 
 
 
with rectangles above the bin whose height represents 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the number of instances or “frequencies” or “count” of 
 
 
 
the dependent variable for that bin.

Description 
 
 
An ideal future state for a given process that might not 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be achievable with current constraints, resources or 
 
 
 
 
knowledge. The ideal state represents a “stretch goal”. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Integrated product or process team composed of 
representatives from all the functional stakeholder 
 
 
 
 
groups for a particular product or process. 
 
 
 
 
Another name for cause and effect diagram, derived 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from its creator Kaoru Ishikawa. 
 
 
 
Just in Time – the practice of delivering supplies to a 
   
   
 
 
 
 
 
customer just as the customer needs then. The contrast 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
would be having supplies stored in inventory until the 
customer needs them. JIT is a specific example of 
 
 
 
 
 
maintaining flow. 
 
 
The Japanese word for continuous improvement. It 
   
 
 
means constant improvement in an unending series of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
small steps. 
 
 
Another name for a Rapid Process Improvement 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Workshop. Ironically, Kaizen means continual 
 
improvement using small steps, where a Kaizen event 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
is a focused workshop introducing a significantly larger 
   
 
 
 
improvement. 
 
 
Visual cuing system to indicate material, parts, and/or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
information is/are authorized to move downstream. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Combining all relevant material, parts, and/or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
information into a single package that can be delivered 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
to the point-of-use in a process to reduce unnecessary 
 
   
 
 
 
movement. 
 
 
An integrated entity that efficiently creates value for its 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
multiple stakeholders by employing lean principles and 
practices. 
 
 
 
The dynamic, knowledge-driven, and customer-focused 
 
 
 
process through which all people in a defined enterprise 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
continuously eliminate waste and create value. 
 
 
 
 
A conservation law for process flow expressed as WIP 
 
 
 
 
= (throughput rate) x (cycle time) = (cycle time)/(takt 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
time).  Given any two of these three variables, the other 
is determined by Little’s law.  Little’s law strictly applies 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
to long term averages of stable systems, i.e. ones 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
which are not starting, stopping or surging. However, it 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is a useful relationship for normal systems.

The use of process or design features to prevent errors 
 
 
 
 
 
or the negative impact of errors. A simple example is a 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gas cap tether to prevent leaving the gas cap at the gas 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
station. 
Waste, or activities that do not add value (see 8 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
wastes). 
 
Unevenness, or irregular or fluctuating production or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
workload due to poor planning, staffing, inoperative 
 
 
 
equipment, missing supplies, or irregular demand. 
 
 
 
 
Overburden of people or equipment, often leading to 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
muda. 
 
Something that does not create value for the customer. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
See definition of “value added”. 
 
 
 
 
 
The time in a process allocated to non valued added 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
activities. 
A chart named after Vilfredo Pareto which displays 
 
 
 
 
 
instances or counts of a (process) variable versus 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
{categories, causes} of the variable in vertical 
rectangles above the {category, cause} name. The data 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is arranged with the tallest bar on the left hand location, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
with the next tallest bar next, etc.  Often a 
 
 
 
   
 
 
superimposed line of cumulative instances is potted 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from left to right. 
 
 
Plan Do Check Act – a variant of the name for PDSA. 
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
Plan Do Study Act – the basic Deming improvement 
 
cycle used for continuous improvement. 
 
 
 
A two by two matrix chart where one axis represents 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the effort or resources for an action and the other axis 
 
 
 
 
 
 
represents the impact of valued added of an action. The 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
name of each quadrant characterizes the combination 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the axis variables: Possibly implement, Implement, 
 
 
 
 
 
Consider, Kill.  Candidate actions to address a need are 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
placed in one of the four quadrants during a 
 
 
brainstorming event. 
 
 
 
The location where supplies, tools, information, human 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
resources are needed to execute a task. 
 
The Japanese word for mistake proofing 
 
 
 
 
Broadly defined as the ability of a process to meet the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
customer’s expectations. Mathematically defined by Cp 
 
 
 
 
 
or Cpk.

Description 
 
 
A flow chart showing all the steps or activities in a 
 
 
 
   
process with the output of each step/activity being 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
connected to the input of a downstream step/activity. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The time that activities are being performed on work in 
 
 
 
 
 
 
process (WIP). Processing time may consist of Value 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Added Time (VAT) and Non Valued Added Time 
 
 
 
 
(NVAT) activities. Other names are: Touch Time (TT), 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In Process Time (IPT), Response Time (RT). 
 
 
 
 
 
A system where a signal from downstream activity for 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
an input results in the upstream activity delivering an 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
output.  In a pure pull system, an end customer order 
 
cascades upstream with each process delivering one 
 
 
 
 
 
 
unit to its downstream customer. A pure pull system has 
 
 
 
 
 
 
no buffers or inventory. 
   
 
 
A system where an upstream activity delivers output as 
 
 
 
 
 
completed into a buffer or inventory for the next 
 
 
 
   
 
downstream activity. 
 
 
A broad term that represents the fitness of a product or 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
service for the customer’s expectations. 
 
 
 
The act or instance of waiting in lines or queues for 
 
 
 
 
 
some action to take place. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A three to five day workshop focused on a specific

Term 
 
Single piece flow 
 
 
 

 
Description 
 
 
The practice of having only one unit of work in each 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
process step of a flow line. If there were only one 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
worker, s/he would complete all the steps in the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
production process for one unit, before starting the next 
 
 
 
 
 
 
unit. In a flow line with multiple workers, the output from 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
one workstation is immediately worked on by the next 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
workstation; i.e. there are no buffers between workers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Six Sigma is a data driven philosophy and methodology 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to eliminate variation from all enterprise processes, 
 
 
 
 
 
named after sigma, the term for standard deviation.

Description 
 
 
The available time for performing work divided by the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
customer demand rate for the product or services from 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the work unit; e.g. if there are 40 orders that need to be 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
filled in an 8 hour day, the takt time would be (8 x 
60)/40 = 12 min.  Takt time represents the drumbeat or 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
pace that the flow line needs to operate at in order to 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
meet the customer demand. It comes from the German 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
word Taktzeit. “takt” translates as “stroke” and “zeit” as 
“time.” 
 
A provider of logistics support between a supplier and a 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
customer; e.g. FedEx might provide all shipping 
services between a supplier and customer. 
 
 
   
 
Go to the actual place, see the actual work being done, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and talk to the actual people doing the work – another 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
name for genschi genbutsu 
 
 
 
The number of {units, patients, documents,…} 
 
 
 
processed during a standard unit of time; e.g. a 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
throughput of 20 patients in a day 
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
The number of {units, patients, documents,…} being 
 
 
 
processed per unit of time; e.g. a throughput of 20 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients per 8 hour day would be a throughput rate of 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.5 patients per hour. Throughput is the inverse of takt 
 
 
 
 
 
time; i.e. throughput = 1/takt time. 20 patients per 8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hour day would correspond to a takt time of 24 min per 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
patient. 
 
Another name for wait time. 
 
 
A horizontal bar chart for a process broken into 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sequential segments showing periods of wait time 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(usually in red) and process time (usually in yellow for 
 
non value added time and green for value added time). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
See definition for process time. 
 
 
A set of practices or management system focused on 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
continuously improving the quality of products or 
 
 
 
services. TQM is based on the assumption that 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
everyone involved in the production and delivery of the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
products or services is responsible for their quality. 
TQM practices are a subset of Lean practices. 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
Upper (Lower) Control Limits are horizontal lines drawn 
 
 
 
   
 
on a process control chart at the distance of +/- 3σ  from 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the mean or average of the data.

Description 
 
 
Upper (Lower) Specification Limits are the customer 
 
 
specified tolerances or variations for a specific process 
 
 
or product; e.g. a hole diameter specified to be 1 inch 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
+/- .01 inches would have its USL = 1.01 inch and LSL -
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
.99 inch.  Or for patient falls per month, the LSL = 0, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
while an USL might be set from benchmark data or 
 
mandates. 
 
The ratio of work demand to work capacity, a number 
 
 
 
 
   
between 0 and 1.  For example if demand for work is 13 
 
   
 
   
  
 
hours and there are 2 workers who have 8 hours 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
available, their utilization would be 13/(2x8) = 0.8125 
 
 
 
 
 
A broad definition is the features of a product or service 
 
 
   
 
 
 
divided by its cost. Specific definitions can be 
 
 
 
 
 
developed for a particular product or service, but 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
generally value is a relative term that is evaluated by 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the customer, or “value is in the eyes of the beholder.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An activity in the value stream that directly contributes 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to customer value, and which satisfies three criteria (1) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the customer wants it, (2) the activity transforms or 
 
 
shapes material or information or humans and (3) it is 
 
 
 
 
done right the first time. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The part of the processing time when value added 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
activities are being performed. 
 
 
 
 
The linked end to end activities of a process which 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
transform input {material, information, people) to output 
 
 
 
 
 
 
{product, components, data, services, people, …}. A 
 
 
 
 
value stream can consist of valued added and non 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
value added activities, as well as wait time. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A process map with quantitative data added for each 
 
 
 
 
 
process step, including wait times and inventory. Data 
 
 
 
 
 
 
might include: processing, wait or cycle times; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inventory; quality or yield data; labor hours; distance 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
traveled, or more. Only valued added data should be 
 
 
 
collected and included. 
 
 
 
 
 
The differences in the output of an activity for a given 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
input due to Common Cause or Special Cause 
variation. 
 
Inventory in a facility that is monitored and replenished 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
by the vendor. An example would be items on a 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
supermarket shelf that are replenished by the supplier’s 
 
 
 
 
staff rather than the store’s staff.

Description 
 
 
Practices that make the state or steps in a process 
 
 
   
visible to the workforce. Examples include status 
 
 
 
 
 
boards, lights, colored sections of the floor for storing 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
different items, and more. 
Diagrams or graphic displays that show the instructions 
 
 
 
 
to produce a part or subassembly. Assembly 
 
 
 
   
instructions for IKEA products represent good examples 
 
 
 
 
of visual work instruction. The opposite would be the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
often frustrating wordy instructions of “insert tab A into 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
slot B” type. 
 
 
A value stream map 
 
 
Value stream mapping and analysis – the act of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
creating a value stream map and then performing 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
analysis of the data to identify bottlenecks, throughput, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cycle time, etc. 
 
The time that whatever is flowing in a value stream is 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
sitting idle with no value added or non-value added 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
work being done. 
 
Any activity that does not add value. 
 
 
 
 
 
Work in Process – the quantity of work that is flowing in 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a value stream.
