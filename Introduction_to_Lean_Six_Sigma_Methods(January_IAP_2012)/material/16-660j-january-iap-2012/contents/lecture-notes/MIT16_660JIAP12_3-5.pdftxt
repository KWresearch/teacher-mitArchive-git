Why Do We Care About Quality? 

Hidden Costs of Non-Conformance  
 =  2 to 3 Times Measured Costs 

Direct Measured Costs: 
• Scrap/rework  
• Service calls 
• Warranties/concessions 
 
Indirect/Hidden Costs: 
• Excess inventory  
• Overtime 
• Non-value added steps 
• Queues and delays 
• Reputation/image

Problems with Inspection 
Based Quality Control 

• Inspection does not add 
value to the customer – it 
simply screens or detects 
(most of the time) defective 
products from leaving the 
factory. 
• Inspection is subject to 
multiple errors 
• Inspector skill and attention 
• Measurement capability 
• Environment (Human Factors)

Inspection Exercise  

This exercise will be in two 30 second sessions 
Task: Find all of the fs or Fs  on a page of text 
• Take out the Inspection Exercise from the 
student folder and turn it face down. 
• On “GO”, circle all the fs or Fs you find    
• On “STOP”, and turn over your sheet and  pass 
the sheet to the person on your right. 
• On “GO”, mark Xs all the other fs or Fs you find    
• On “STOP”, count up the number of fs and Fs 
that are circled and the number with Xs.

Flow Charts 

• Flow Chart examples 
• Process maps 
• S/W program flow 
• Medical algorithms

Myocardial Infarction (aka heart attack) 
• Why are Flow Charts a quality tool? 
• Visual  description improves comprehension 
• Helps assure process steps are done in the right 
sequence 
• Ties outputs to inputs 
• Assists with data collection

Histograms 

Shows  
• Frequency of 
occurrence  
• Frequency distribution: 
normal, random, … 

Useful to see 
• The spread of a distribution 
• Changes over time 
• Quantitative inputs/outputs 
• Comparison to customer requirements

What product attribute does the Mars Company control 
variation of to deliver a quality to its customers? 
 
• Open your bag of M&Ms – don’t eat them yet! 
• Count the number of M&Ms in your bag by color. 
• Fill in your data on the Check Sheet for your table. 
• Contribute table data when asked by instructor.

Scatter Diagrams 

• Plots of (x,y) pairs of numerical data 
• Can show whether a correlation exists 
• Useful starting point for root cause analysis 

Uncorrelated data 

Correlated data

• Inspection is an ineffective way to produce 
high quality products and services 
• Total Quality Management and Lean Thinking 
are closely related 
• Lean Thinking and TQM both utilized simple, 
structured, quantitative and qualitative tools 
to achieve quality 
• There are seven basic quality tools 
• But remember – capable people are the most 
important factor in achieving quality
