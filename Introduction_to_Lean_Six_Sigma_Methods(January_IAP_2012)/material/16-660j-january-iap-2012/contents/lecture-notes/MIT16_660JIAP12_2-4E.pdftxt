Eight Engineering Wastes 

1. Over-production 
2. Inventory 
3. Transportation 

4. Unnecessary Movement 

5. Waiting 

6. Defective Outputs 

7. Over-processing 

8. Unused employee 
creativity 

Analysis, reports, tests not needed 
Unfinished analysis, reports, tests 
Handoffs, complex validations 
“Stop & Go” tasks. Working on too many 
projects at one time. 
Waiting for decisions or waiting for input. 
Rework due to wrong requirements or 
input. Errors causing the effort to be 
redone to correct the problem. 
Unneeded “bells & whistles” for analysis, 
communications. Re-invented solutions. 
Not engaging engineers in process 
improvements for engineering

• 30% of PD charged time “setup and 
waiting” (aero and auto industry survey ) 
 
• Time is wasted 
• 62% of tasks idle at any given time  
(detailed member company study) 
• 50-90% task idle time found in 
Kaizen-type events

VSM Applied to Product 
Development 
• Same basic techniques apply 
• Flows are knowledge and information 
flows rather than physical products 
• Process steps may overlap or involve 
planned iterations 
• Value added steps add or transform 
knowledge, or reduce uncertainty  
(role of analysis steps) 
• Quantifies key parameters for each 
activity  (cycle time, cost, quality 
defects, inventory, etc.) 
• Provides systematic method to 
improve a process by eliminating 
waste

Lean Thinking Needs to Start With Engineering

Customer Defines Product 
Value

Principle in Military Aerospace Product 
Development”, LAI RP99-01-16, Jul 1999. 
web.mit.edu/lean 

Product Value is a function of the product 
Features and attributes to satisfy a customer need 
•
• Quality or lack of defects 
Availability relative to when it is needed, and  
•
Price and/or cost of ownership to the customer 
•
Lean Engineering Basics V7.6 - Slide 12

Engineering Drives Cost 
   80% of a product’s cost is determined by the 
engineering design: 
• Number of parts / tolerances 
• Assembly technique (fasteners, EB welding, co-cure)  
• Processes (heat treat, shot peen, etc.) 
• Tooling approach (matched metal dies, injection 
molding, etc.) 
• Materials (titanium, aluminum, composites, etc.) 
• Avionics / software  
• Design complexity 
• Design re-use 

Engineers must make the right choices, early in the process, 
to insure customer satisfaction and low lifecycle costs.

Integrated Product and 
Process Development - IPPD 
• Preferred approach to develop producible 
design meeting value expectations 
• Utilizes: 
• Systems Engineering: Translates customer needs 
and requirements into product architecture and set 
of specifications 
• Integrated Product Teams (IPTs): Incorporates 
knowledge about all lifecycle phases 
• Modern Engineering tools: Enable lean processes 
• Training: Assures human resources are ready 

Capable people, processes and tools are required

Tools of Lean Engineering 
• Integrated digital tools reduce wastes of handoffs 
and waiting, and increase quality 
• Mechanical (3-D solids based design) 
• VLSIC (Very Large Scale Integrated Circuit) toolsets 
• Software development environments/Model-Based 
Engineering 
• Production simulation (and software equivalents) 
• Common parts / specifications / design reuse 
• Design for manufacturing and assembly (DFMA) 
• Dimensional/configuration/interface management 
• Variability reduction 
• Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) software 

All of these tools enabled by people working 
together in Integrated Product Teams (IPTs)

Part Count Reduction: DFMA 

• Why reduce part count? 
• Reduce recurring & non-recurring cost 
• Reduce design, manufacturing, 
assembly, testing and inspection work 
• Reduce inventory 
• Reduce maintenance spares 

 
• Sometimes requires “performance” trades, 
but not always – and cost and schedule 
savings are typically significant

Lego Simulation DFMA 
Exercise 

Redesign the airplane!  Rules: 
• Satisfy customer 
• Moldline (outside shape) must remain exactly the same 
• Landing gear must be (and only landing gear can be) brown 
• In-service quality must improve 
• Increase delivery quantities 
• Reduce manufacturing costs 
• Part count ($5/part) 
• Fewer parts = more capacity 
Incorporate suppliers 
• Innovations 
• Reduced part diversity (?)

Present your design to your facilitator 
Demonstrate it satisfies all criteria
