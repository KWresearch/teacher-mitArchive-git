Lean Supply Chain 
Basics 

Impact of Supply Chain 
Management  
 

“Only 7% of companies today are 
effectively managing their supply 
chain. However, these companies are 
73% more profitable than other 
manufacturers.” 

Deloitte & Touche Study, October 2003

Key Attributes of a Lean 
Supply Chain 
1. Alignment of supply chain design with 
product characteristics 
2. Supplier participation in material flow 
and logistics 
3. Supplier involvement in design and 
development 
4. Seamless information flow

1 - Matching Supply Chains 
with Products 
• “Push” supply chain is focused on efficiency for 
meeting predictable demand at lowest cost. 
• Typically for long product lifecycle and mature or 
commodity items  
• “Pull” supply chain is focused on responsiveness for 
unpredictable demand to avoid inventory & stock outs. 
• Typically for shorter product life cycle, custom 
items 
• The reality is that a given product may have 
components of both the efficient and responsive 
supply chain designs.  This approach has been labeled 
the Hybrid Supply Chain.

2 - Supplier Participation in 
Material Flow and Logistics 
• Just-in-time deliveries 
Eliminates inventory - but parts must show up on time!  
• Kitting for point-of-use 
Eliminates unpacking, looking for parts - requires 
supplier involvement in production system design 
• Vendor-Managed Inventory 
Vendor owns it, keeps track of it, until it is used  
• Third Party Logistics 
Have FedEx handle these?   

Different supply chain designs  
require different practices

Old Method 

New Method 

• Parts shipped in re-usable shadow 
boxes direct to point-of-use 
• Empty box returned, triggers re-order 

• Parts individually ordered 
• Shipped in bubble wrap and 
peanuts 
• Unpacked at dock – wrapping 
discarded 
• Shelved (using good 5S) 
• Fetched when needed – often 
missing or damaged 
• Reordered by schedule or when 
stock-outs discovered

EXOSTAR Facilitates Supply 
Chain Management Streamlining 
At Rolls-Royce the eProcurement implementation has 
produced a number of quantitative and qualitative 
benefits, including: 
 
• Rationalizing the direct supplier base from more than 
5,000 to several hundred 
• Reduction in cost of goods of up to 20%; 
• Reduction in inventory value levels as much as 80%; 
• Reduction in errors due to the elimination of manual re-
keying of buying data; 
• Reduced cycle time, in some cases by up to 80%; 
• Near-elimination of paper and fax processes. 
• Improved relations with suppliers, who have benefited 
from reduced transaction costs and improved efficiency.
