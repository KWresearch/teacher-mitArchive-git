•	 This talk presents an overview of the teaching simulation 
used in 16.660 / 16.853 / ESD.62J Introduction to Lean Six 
Sigma Methods 
It cannot replace the simulation experience, but outlines 
the goals, process, and basic lessons of the simulation 
It was written for a conference on “Conceive, Design, 
Implement, and Operate” (CDIO) teaching methods, and
the second half of the talk relates the simulation 
experience (and this course in general) to the CDIO
method.

Organize  Activity 

Lean  Principles 
5S, Visual Control, 
Standard  Work 

Typical Student  Actions 
Clean up worksite, organize 
inventory, standardize 
sequence of ordering, 
assembly,  and  paperwork  
Move work between plants to 
balance work at 120 sec and 
12-13  parts 

Takt time, Single-piece Flow, 
Balanced  Work 

Balance Workload between 
Facilities – this requires an 
“engineering request” 
(approved by instructor )  
Change (improve, eliminate, 
or move) facilities – this 
requires “corporate approval” 
(also by instructor)  
Modernize parts order system 
by eliminating paperwork – 
requires  “corporate  approval” 

Eliminate Unnecessary Tasks, 
Single-piece Flow, Just-in-
Time  Delivery 

Demolish “warehouse;” freed 
student moves  orders  and  parts 

Eliminate Unnecessary Tasks, 
Standard  work 

Upgrade parts ordering system 
and standardize orders to 
single-plane  sets 

Students use Lean Process Improvement Tools 
to make Simulation Process Effective

Lean  Principles 
Lean Engineering, DFMA , 
Supplier Integration 

Typical Student  Actions 
Reduce part count by 10 (to 28 
per plane) using large Lego 
blocks  available  to  suppliers 
Move work between plants to 
balance work at 60 sec and 7-9 
parts, including using excess 
capacity at final assembly to 
install some exterior parts 
(e.g.  landing gear)  
Students find they must 
increase capacity at some 
manufacturing plants (but can 
now justify it  economically)

Simulation-Based Learning

and our Learning Objectives 

Increased comprehension of the curriculum 
•	 Controlled studies show increased comprehension using
“games” vs. lectures or static web-based learning 
•	 Controlled studies also show improved outcomes 

measured by behavior 

•  Better understanding of context and holistic,

system-spanning nature of lean changes

•	 Learning through experience - a practice field
for lean change 
•	 Supported as goals, improved outcomes unproven 
Increase student involvement and excitement 
•	 Observed! 
Most literature on computer-based simulations

Non-computer Peer Efforts

•  Simple simulation to make one learning point

•  Beer game 
•  Dot games 
•  Dice games 
•  Lean Manufacturing Simulations 
•  Timewise clock manufacturing 
•  Various lego games - cars, etc. 
•  Lean Shipbuilding 
•  Design and Analysis Simulations 
•  Requirements and concept design 
•  Engineering processes 
Mostly simple systems designed 
to teach specific lessons

CDIO and Continuous 

Process Improvement

•	 Typical Continuous Process Improvement
methods have structures very similar to CDIO! 
•	 Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) 
•  Shewhart, Deming 
•	 Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control (DMAIC) 
•  Six-Sigma 
•	 Mobilization-Diagnosis-Redesign-Transition 
•  Hammer (Re-Engineering) 
•	 CPI is about designing and operating
business systems! 
•	 We avoid favoring any one camp 
Course CONTENT resembles CDIO 

lean.mit.edu/ednet

CDIO and 
Simulation-Based Learning 
•	 Course methods puts students through a 
CDIO cycle in the simulated world 
•	 Comprehend: the existing system and its weaknesses,
using lean tools and quantitative data found in the
simulation 
•	 Design: the new system, using standard design 

techniques, and constrained by the “physics” and

finances of the simulation 

•	
Implement: the new system; facing practical challenges
(mostly organizational) above and beyond the design 
•	 Operate (and Iterate): keep the new system working, face
new practical challenges and start the process over
again to take it to the next level 

Course METHOD is CDIO

Simulations allow CDIO on 
complex systems 
•	 Most complex systems are not available for 
students to manipulate for teaching purposes 
•	 Students can get a CDIO experience from 
manipulating a simulation if: 
•	 Complex enough to capture the key features of the 
emergent behavior of the system 
•	 Simple enough to have an acceptable learning curve 
•	 Fast enough to allow multiple change cycles within 
teaching period 
•	 Credible and Fun 

Simulation ENABLES CDIO

Evaluation


•	 Students asked if Lean 
Academy Modules
“provided positive
reinforcement of the 
concepts” 
•	 Six academies, N=194 
•	 Circle = 90% confidence 
•	 Bars = extremes between 
means within categories 

Simulation assessed significantly higher than other 
types of learning in ALL cases

Comments Indicate 
Simulation Goals Met 
Increased comprehension of the curriculum 
… helped with application of what we learned in lecture 
It took a while to get the concepts but it finally clicked during the 2nd  segment [of the 
simulation] 
•	 Learning through experience - a practice field for lean
change 
Hands on – Excellent.  Telling someone how something works is fine.  Having 
someone do it teaches it 
LOVED the simulations.  Figuring stuff out yourself makes things make much more 
sense 
Increase student involvement and excitement 
I really enjoyed the simulations with the Legos.  This made time fly. 
… SO good and SO cool.  One of the most enlightening engineering experiences I've 
had. 
•	 Team Building 
Created a good sense of camaraderie

•	 Types of answers to
open question “what

Caveats 

•	 Evaluation based on satisfaction, not outcomes 
•	 Outcome data for Lean Academy positive, but does not 
differentiate between modules 
•	 Cost and Time 
•	 Significant upfront expense (Legos, etc.) 
•	 Need 6 trained facilitators 
•	 Simulations are vulnerable to disruption 
•	 Logistic and facilitation errors degrade experience 
•	 Cannot satisfy all learning styles 
•	 Students asked for more and less simulation time 
•	 Real stress from simulated process difficulties, competition 

Typical issues for teaching simulations

Conclusions

•	 Unique simulation of an aerospace enterprise created 
•	 Subset used in Lean Academy 
•	 Teaches use of lean process improvement tools 
•	 Gives context and hands-on experience 
•	
Increases student involvement and enthusiasm 
•	 Simulation provides a laboratory for CDIO of complex 
systems
