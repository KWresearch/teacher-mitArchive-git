Mortality Amenable to Health Care 
Mortality from causes considered amenable to health care is deaths before age 75 
that are potentially preventable with timely and appropriate medical care

Inflexibility is the greatest barrier to 
successfully applying Lean in health care 
and it is best overcome by Genchi 
Genbutsu 

20Lesson 9 

Standardization must occur before 
you can have innovation and 
improvement 

21“It is impossible to improve any process until it is 
standardized.  If the process is shifting from here 
to there than any improvement will just be one 
more variation that is occasionally used and 
mostly ignored.  One must standardize the 
process before improvements can be made.”  
Masaaki Imai 

 

22The first step in improving the treatment of any 
disease is standardizing its care.  If the treatment 
of an acute or chronic condition within our system 
is variable, any effort at improvement will just be 
one more variation that is occasionally used and 
mostly ignored.  We must standardize our care 
using evidence- or consensus-based pathways 
before we can improve it using discovery and 
innovation.
