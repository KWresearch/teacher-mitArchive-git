Creating flow:
•  Focus on what is flowing through the process
•  Don䇻䇻t be limited by organizational boundaries 
•  Eliminate bottlenecks, minimize buffers

Time 


 
 
 
 
 
Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull  Perfection 
•  Time is an essential metric for improving flow
 
 
•  There are different ways to measure time 
•  Wait time 
•  Processing time
•  Cycle time 
•  Customer demand or lead time 
•  The key is to understand the local definition of 
 
how time is measured

Wait and Process Time 

 
 
 
 
 
Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull  Perfection 
•	  Wait time 
•	  The time Work in Process (WIP) is idle - in queues, 
buffers or storage 
 
•	  Other Names: queue time, delay time 
 
 
•	  Processing time
•	  The time that activities are being performed on WIP 
 
•	  Processing time may consist of Value Added Time 
 
(VAT) and Non Valued Added Time (NVAT) activities. 
•	  Other names: Touch Time (TT), In Process Time 
 
 
(IPT), Response Time (RT), Activity time

Value  Value Stream 
•	  The time required to execute activities in a process
 
 
•	  It can be measured for: 
 
•	  A single task or activity 
 
•	  A group of tasks or activities 
•	  A single process 
 
•	  A group of processes, e.g., customer order to customer 
 
delivery 
•  Cycle time includes processing time and wait time
 
 
•  Other names: lead time or span time or throughput

•	  Calculate the time in seconds for the 11 process steps 
 
and the total cycle time.
•	  Make sure to convert everything to time per order 
 
•	  Don䇻䇻t forget effects of rework 
•	  Sum times to calculate an average cycle time for the 
customer to get a hotdog (order to delivery) 
 
•	  Use the sheet provided
 
•	  You will be reporting your total cycle time to the instructor 
 
•	  Record all times on a flip chart for presentation to the class 
if instructed to do so

 Let Customers Pull Value 

 
 
 
 
 
Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull  Perfection 
•	  Push system – each activity delivers its output 
 
when it is done 
•	  Results in build up of batches with lots of 

inventory; defective goods pile up 

•	  Pull system – each activity delivers its output just 
 
 
 
as the next activity needs its input 
•	  Triggered by the customer (external & internal) 
 
 
•	  Results in smooth flow with no batches or voids 
 
•	  Minimizes inventory and rework due to defects 
 
•	  Inherently, there is very little waste in a pull system
 
 
 
•	  Pull systems are agile and responsive to customer 
demand

Moving from Flow to Pull 

 
 
 
 
 
Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull  Perfection 
Pull requires flow plus predictable cycle time, using 
•	  Takt time 
 
•	  Balanced work 
 
•	  Standard work 
 
•	  Single piece flow
 
•	  Kanban system 
 
•  Just in time delivery of all material and information 
 
 
Creating pull:
 
•	  Start with the customer and work backwards through 
the system 
•	  If cycle time <= customer expectation time then pull 
can be accomplished 
•	  If cycle time > customer expectation time then buffer 
 
inventory is needed (or cycle time must be reduced!)

Pull System: 
Dell Computer 

 
 
 
 
 
Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull  Perfection 
•	  Dell developed the selling highly customized 
computer systems direct to customers 
 
•  Customer order initiates the pull process 
•  Orders can ship same day 
  
•	  Partnerships with suppliers allow very quick 
 
replenishment of vendor-owned Dell inventory 
 
•	  Dell ships 110,000 systems/day with very low 
 
 
 
 
inventory costs 
Aspects of the Dell system have become standard  
practice for many consumer products

Takt Time -
Measure of Customer Demand 
 
 
 
 
 
Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull  Perfection 
Takt Time is… 
•	  From the German word 䇾Taktzeit䇿 
•	 䇾takt䇿 is German for 䇾stroke䇿 
• 䇾zeit䇿 is German for 䇾time䇿 
•	  A reference number that provides 

 
a drum beat for the process
 

Available time 
Takt time =  Customer demand 
 
rate for available time 

Example: 

 
The available time is a year or 235 days. 

There are 40 orders for this year.  


What is the takt time?  


 
235/40 ~  6 days

Hot Dog Stand Takt Time 


 
Sasha 

 
Andy
 

•  What is the takt time for  S&A Hot dogs for 

•  50 customers? 
•  75 customers? 
•  Time available is 4 hours (240 minutes)
 
•  50 customers – takt time is 240 / 50 = 4.8 min 
•  75 customers – takt time is 240 / 75 = 3.2 min

Little䇻䇻s Law
 
•	  For most systems, average values of work in 
progress (WIP), cycle time and takt time 
satisfy Little䇻s Law 
 
WIP =  Cycle Time 
 
= (Throughput  Rate ) X (Cycle Time)

Takt Time 
•	  For example, for a specified takt time, large 
amounts of WIP implies a long cycle time, as 
each article spends a lot of time in inventory! 
 

Cycle time, WIP and takt time or 
throughput rate  are 
interdependent.

Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull  Perfection 
Takt time example, continued… 

 

To meet takt time, a product has to be delivered 
every 6 days.  But if it takes 30 days to build, how is 
 
 
this possible?

Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull  Perfection 
•	  Best process currently known, understood, 
 
and used today (evidence based) 
 
 

•	  Tomorrow it can be better based on 
 
continuous improvement 

•	  Standard work is the key to repeatability and

Single Piece Flow 

 
 
 
 
 
Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull  Perfection 

Single Piece Flow
 
 
•	  Processing one unit at a 
time through all the 
steps to completion 
 
•	  Only one unit in work at 
any step in the process 
 
•	  Low inventory levels 
 
 
•	  Defects immediately 
 
found 


Batch and Queue
 
 
•	  Processing multiple units 
at the same time 
•	  Optimizes the efficiency at 
 
each step in the process 
•	  High inventory levels 
 
•	  Leads to larger scrap and 
rework

Visual Control and Andon 

 
 
 
 
 
Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull  Perfection 

•	  Visual control helps identify the  
 
status of the process at a glance
 
•	  Makes the process apparent  
 
 
to everyone involved with or 
observing it 
•	  Only valuable if used for 
 
active process management 
•	  Andon is a specific visual control device, typically a group 
 
of lights indicating the current status of the process
 
•	  Each step has a set of lights which indicates whether the 
step is proceeding as planned, needs monitoring, or 
requires immediate attention
•	  In a pull system, if action is required, the entire process 
 
stops to correct the problem

  Perfection 
5 whys can be used to help determine the root 
cause of mistakes 
 

Example: The Jefferson Monument is deteriorating!
 
Why?  It gets washed all the time.
 
 
 
  
Why?  It always has bird droppings on it.
 
 
Why?  Birds come into the monument to feed on spiders.
 
 
  
Why?  The spiders are there feeding on gnats.
 
  
  
Why?  The gnats are there because the lights are left on all 

time. 
Five is only a 䇾䇾rule of thumb䇿 – use as many 䇾whys䇿 as 
 
 
needed to get to root cause.
