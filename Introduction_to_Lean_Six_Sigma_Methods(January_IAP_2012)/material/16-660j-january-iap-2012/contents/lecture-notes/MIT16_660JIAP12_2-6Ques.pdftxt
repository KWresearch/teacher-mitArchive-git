You are given a partial VSM for the Accounts Payable Process.  It includes 
average processing times and volumes, but does not include information on 
capacity utilization.  
 
Prepare answers for questions 1-4 before class tomorrow.  
 
1.  How much time in processing does an average item take once it reaches an 
analyst in AP?  Do not include waiting times in queues ---just include actual time 
spent processing (often called “touch time”).  
 
2.  Compute the workload in minutes per year for the entire team of accounts 
payable analysts.   
 
3.  Compute the available work time in minutes per year for the entire team of 
accounts payable analysts.  Assume that analysts normally work a 5 day week 
with time off for holidays and vacations in addition.  What is the average analyst 
utilization?

erroneous PFR items?  On the duplicate PFR check?
