A3 Thinking 

Learning Objectives 

At the end of this module, you should be 
able to: 
• Recognize that A3 is a way of thinking and not 
just a tool 
• Use the A3 chart as a standard tool for 
implementing lean projects

A3 Thinking 

The thought process used is paramount to 
the tool (A3 Report) 
It is a collaborative problem-solving method 
It promotes: 
• Logical, objective (data-driven) thinking 
• Results and process 
• Synthesis, distillation, and visualization 
• Alignment 
• Coherence within and consistency across 
• Systems perspective

Current Situation 

Diagrams  
• Efficient means for 
communication 
 
Useful questions*: 
 
• Are activities clearly 
specified with regard to 
content, order, and 
intended outcome? 
• Are the connections 
between entities clear & 
explicit?

Recommendations 
• Directly address the root 
cause 
• Should move the process 
from the current toward 
the ideal state 

 
Plan 
• Define steps to correct 
each cause  
• Identify responsibilities, 
dates, details 
• Use GANTT Charts, 
tables

Acme Stamping Steering Bracket Value Stream Improvement 
Background 
• Product: stamped-steel steering brackets (left- and  right-hand drive). 
• 18,400 brackets/month; daily shipments in pallets of 10 trays of 20 brackets.   
•Customer State Street Assembly  is requesting price cuts and tightening delivery 
requirements. 
    

Current Situation  
•Production Lead time:23.6 days 
•Processing time: only 188 seconds. 
•Large  inventories of material between each process.  
•Long changeover  times; downtime in welding.

Analysis 
•Each process operates as isolated islands, disconnected from customer.  
•Push system; material builds up between each process.  
•Each process builds according to its own operating constraints (changeover, downtime, 
etc.  
•Plans based on 90 and 30-day  forecasts from customer.  Weekly schedule for each 
department. System is frequently overidden  to make delivery.   

Goals: Improve profitability while meeting tougher customer demands:  
•Reduce lead time – 23.6 days to <5 days 
•Reduce inventories: Stamping – <2 days 
   Welding – Eliminate 
   Shipping – <2 days 

A3 Example 
12/6/01 
Shook/Verble 
Counterrmeasures :  
•Create continuous flow in through Weld and Assembly 
•Establish Takt Time: Base the pace of work through Weld and Assembly on 
customer demand 
•Set new Weld-assembly cell as pacemaker for entire value stream  
•Establish EPEX build schedule for stamping based on actual use of pacemaker 
cell and pull steel coils from supplier based on actual usage by Stamping.  
•Reduce Changeover  time in Stamping and Weld 
•Improve uptime in Weld 
•Establish material handling  routes for frequent withdrawal and delivery 
•Establish new production  instruction system with Leveling Box

Recommendations:   
• Add XXXXX to PFR invoices 
• Use document imaging for invoices received 
• Establish queued call center using Lotus Note 
• Train purchasing, receiving, AP personnel 

Background 
• Switched to PFR system in 1993 
• 80% of suppliers on PFR 
• Problem is processing remaining invoices  
Current Situation 
• 6.4 wks avg cycle time for invoices & growing 
• 12% past due payments and growing.  
• Mailroom does not catch all PFR invoices 
• 16 AP staff each have own groups of suppliers

Analysis 
• AP staff workload is 95.8% 
• 42.7% analyst time spent on PFR related tasks 
• Activity Time/Total Flow Time = 0.0014 
Goal: Process invoices  in 10 days or less 
• No staff increase, no new software systems 
• Establish training & communication plans

Join your AP Case Study team 
Develop an A3 plan to respond to Question 8 
• “Suppose your are the RPI team leader and have to 
report back to Joanie.  What will you recommend?” 
Spend 20 minutes preparing your A3 plan 
• Recall the management constraints (next slide) 
• Consider what RC groups would participate in RPI team 
• Verify that the provided information is correct 
• Complete the additional information blocks 
• Use postit notes on large A3 for draft plan elements 
• Record final recommendations on large A3 sheet  
Be ready for class review of your A3 plan

Management Constraints 
Recall the constraints given by management 
• Main objective is reduction of cycle time 
• Invoice resolution less than 10 days, shorter is even better 
• Establish a training program for everyone effected by 
the change 
• Formalize communication requirements for invoice 
payment with suppliers 
• Changes must be accomplished within current SAP 
system 
• Use already available in house software or IT 
technology 
• Action items to be completed within 30 days 
• No additional staff can be authorized

• A3 is both a way of thinking and a 
tool. 
• A3 process can be used to initiate 
a discussion around problems & 
possible solutions  
• A3 thinking can anchor a 
continuous improvement – and a 
continuously learning – culture 
 
• A3 represents a standard problem 
solving process that can be used 
by all workers to become problem 
solvers all the time.
