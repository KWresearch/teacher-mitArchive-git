Five Lean Thinking 
Fundamentals 

•

• Specify value: Value is defined by customer in terms of 
specific products and services 
 
Identify the value stream: Map out all end-to-end linked 
actions, processes and functions necessary for 
transforming inputs to outputs to identify and eliminate 
waste 
 
• Make value flow continuously: Having eliminated waste, 
make remaining value-creating steps “flow”  
 
• Let customers pull value: Customer’s “pull” cascades all 
the way back to the lowest level supplier, enabling just-in-
time production 
 
• Pursue perfection: Pursue continuous process of 
improvement striving for perfection 

Ref: James Womack and Daniel T. Jones, Lean Thinking (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1996).

Value Stream Map (VSM) 
• A tool used to improve a process by identifying added 
value and eliminating waste 
 
• A process map that follows the value creation process 
• “strap yourself to the product (or service)  
and see where you go” 
 
• A process map with data added 
• Times: processing, wait, cycle 
• Quality: number of rejects 
• Inventory 
• Resources 
• Number of people 
• Space 
• Distance traveled 
• Whatever else is useful for analyzing the process

Steps for Creating a VSM 

1. Define customer value and the process 
“Walk” the process to identify tasks and flows 
•
Identify value-added and waste process steps 
•
2. Create the “current state” VSM 
• Gather data on resources, time, quality for each step 
3. Analyze map to determine opportunities for 
improvement 
Identify bottlenecks and other flow impediments 
•
Brainstorm actions to eliminate waste and add value 
•
4. Create a “future-state” map to visualize the 
desired and realistic next state  
5. Create action plans to move toward future state

• Value added time 
• Non value added time 
• Wait time 
• Calculate the total “touch time” that Sasha and 
Andy spend on a single order 
• Be ready to report your answers to the class

Summary - S&A Value Stream 
Analysis (VSA) 
• Current production (50 customers) is a little below 
current capacity (64 customers) of Andy and Sasha 
• Process improvement needed to meet growing 
demand 
• Andy and Sasha are both underutilized 
• But utilization is not balanced between them 
• Cycle time of 7.43 min per customer  
(or even 5.8 min) too long 
• Should be able to shorten cycle time to meet 
demands of customers for faster service 
Bottom Line 
Sasha and Andy should implement process 
improvement for week 3 to meet growing demand!

• Help Sasha and Andy figure what to improve 
• How can utilization be improved? 
• How can cycle time be reduced? 
• What has to be done to serve 75 customers? 
• What has to be done to serve 100 customers?

Why is VSM a Useful Tool? 

• Helps visualize interactions and flows  
 
• Shows linkages between information and product  
flows 
 
• Provides a common language for talking about a 
process 
 
• Helps to identify:  
• the constraint(s) - any resource whose capacity is 
less than customer demand;  
• wastes as well as their sources

Tips for Creating a VSM 

• Involve entire team 
 
• Actually walk the process - follow the material 
and information through the process, starting 
at the beginning 
 
• Use Post-it notes and butcher paper 
 
• Use symbols or icons that are meaningful to 
the process but common enough to be 
understood by all involved
