On the Way to Lunch. 
 
 
“Just a week to go until the Accounts Payable RPI2 event kicks off”, thought 
Joanie Meyer, Manager of Disbursements at Rockwell Collins, as she made her 
way to the lunchroom with her colleague, Tom Bednar. As Manager of 
Disbursements, Joanie oversaw four departments within accounting:  The Sales 
and Use Tax Department; the Payroll, Time, and Expense Reporting 
Department; the Accounts Payable Department; and the International Accounting 
Department.  Joanie had joined Rockwell Collins after graduating from college 
with her accounting degree and had worked for the company ever since.  When 
Rockwell Collins had been spun off from Rockwell International in 2001, Joanie 
had wondered how well the spin-off would work. Although initially Rockwell had 
faced some cash-flow problems, the company had successfully dealt with those 
issues and was now rapidly gaining market share from its competitors in 
commercial and military avionics. 
 
 
Joanie recalled how Rockwell’s new CEO, Clay Jones, had developed and 
pushed Rockwell’s “Lean Electronics” initiative not long after he had taken over.  
After first seeing some successes in applying lean principles to the 
manufacturing floor, Rockwell had begun trying to apply the same principles to 
 
other functional areas. 
 
“I remember our first RPI event in 1999”, thought Joanie to herself.  “We 
managed to reduce the cycle time on payout of expense reports from 5 weeks to 
1 week, but after six months we were right back where we started. Whatever we 
do this time”, decided Joanie, “We’ve got to follow through to make sure any 
 
improvements are lasting.” 
 
Rockwell Collins Background 
 
 
Rockwell Collins is a leading provider of commercial and military avionics 
systems and information technology.  Key customers include aircraft 
manufacturers, airlines, and government.  The company was founded as Collins 
Radio Company in 1933 by Arthur Collins who had invented, developed, and 
 
produced innovative short wave radio equipment that was made famous through 
providing a communications link for Admiral Richard Byrd’s 1933 expedition to 
the South Pole.  In 1973, Collins Radio was acquired by Rockwell International.  
Today, Rockwell Collins is once again an independent company with 
approximately 17,000 employees in over 60 locations in 27 countries. 
 
Joanie’s Accounts Payable Department was currently staffed with 16 full-time 
personnel.  Rockwell had begun implementing its invoice-less PFR3  system in

1993 with the goal of eventually using PFR on any purchase involving the receipt 
of some type of material and had started its SAP4 implementation in 1999.  To 
  
date, about 80% of transactions have been converted to PFR status; the 
remainder, however, require some manual processing and approval, and it is 
those that had been giving the greatest problems. 
 
 
A simplified description of how Rockwell’s PFR system pays vendors breaks the 
mechanics into three parts.  First, the purchasing department enters a PO5 into 
the SAP system.  Second, the receiving department enters data into the SAP 
system upon receipt of the material.  Third, the SAP system triggers a vendor 
payment when the PO and the receipt information are reconciled.  One feature of 
Rockwell’s PFR system is that vendors do not bill Rockwell for either freight or 
sales tax.  Instead, vendors charge Rockwell’s freight account directly for freight 
charges and Rockwell self-assesses sales taxes.  
 
 
A Meeting with Don 
 
 
Joanie recalled her meeting with Don Doudna, the Assistant Controller to whom 
Joanie reported.  “Just look at this”, Don had said as he had pointed to a column 
of numbers in a spreadsheet.  “We’ve got over 10% of our accounts overdue, 
and our suppliers are not happy campers.  In some cases, it’s even impacting 
further shipments of parts, causing our manufacturing plant to miss shipping due 
 
dates.”
 
 “Additionally”, Don had continued, “our cycle time through the Accounts Payable 
process has been running at about 6 weeks, a pretty big increase over last year. 
 
Somehow, you’ve got to get a handle on this.”  
 
 
Collaborating with Colleen 
 
Following that meeting, Joanie had spent some time with Colleen Kelly, the 
manager of her Accounts Payable Department to better understand the process. 
In an initial walk-through, Joanie wondered if there was anything obvious she 
could see that would help pinpoint a problem.  Although no single thing really 
jumped out at her, Joanie couldn’t help but notice that everyone seemed very 
busy.  Five of the 16 analysts were examining microfilm records at the microfiche 
readers when she started her walkthrough, and there seemed to be a constant 
parade of analysts between their work areas and the microfiche readers.  Eight of 
the remaining 11 analysts were on the phone, talking with suppliers who had 
called in to inquire either about getting paid or about why they were paid 
incorrectly.  The remaining three were all engaged in combing through the 
massive stacks of paper computer printouts that covered the desks of all the 
analysts.  Throughout her walkthrough, ringing phones provided a constant 
 
distraction from her discussion with Colleen.

Thanking her lucky stars that she had instructed Colleen to begin tracking some 
processing metrics last year, Joanie noted, “You folks certainly keep busy down 
here, Colleen.  You remember the AP6 quarterly metric analysis we developed 
last year?  Can you grab the summary sheets for the past 4 quarters and meet 
me in my office in 15 minutes?  (See Table 1)  We need to take a close look at 
where we are with this and in particular, see if there are any noticeable trends.” 
 
After completing their discussion of the summary sheets, Joanie and Colleen 
agreed that a good next step would be to complete a formal VSM7 of the 
 
Accounting Invoice Resolution Process. 
 
 “We need to start the VSM at the point that we receive incoming mail from 
 
suppliers”, said Joanie. 
 
“Sounds right to me”, said Colleen.  “I’ll set up a quick meeting next week with 
the mailroom people and some of our AP folks who have been heavily involved in 
the process. It’d help out if you’d come to kick off the VSM meeting to let our 
 
folks know what level of detail you’re looking for.” 
 
 
The VSM Meeting. 
 
At the VSM kickoff, Joanie explained that she wanted the VSM to start with the 
event of receiving incoming mail, and continue until the invoice is resolved and 
 
the resolution is recorded to microfilm. 
 
At the VSM meeting, Bill Hutchins from the mailroom patiently explained what 
 
happened to incoming mail. 
 
“After it’s received”, said Bill, “it’s got to be opened and examined to determine 
whether or not it belongs to AP.  If it’s not, then we have to re-route it to the right 
 
department.” 
 
“What happens next if it doesn’t have to be re-routed?” asked Colleen.  
 
“Well, in that case”, commented Bill, “we have to check to see if it has a 
Purchase Order (PO) or not.  If it doesn’t, then we have to follow up with a call to 
the vendor contact person to straighten that out.  On the other hand, if it does 
have a PO (or once we get the PO issue straightened out with the vendor), we 
next have to check to see whether or not the Purchase Order is for an item on 
 
the PFR system.” 
 

 

“Okay”, Colleen said, “I get the picture.  If it is a PFR item, then you just toss it 
since it’s already been paid for off the PFR system.  If not, then it goes to the

appropriate analyst.  Since we’ve assigned companies to analysts alphabetically, 
that should be pretty straightforward”.  
 
 
“Yes”, said Bill, “it is.  Companies whose name starts with an Aa through Be go to 
Sullivan, and so on.  What gets me though is why we get all those invoices for 
PFR items.  The vendors know they’re on the PFR system and we don’t need an 
 
invoice to pay them.” 
 
“You’re right”, asserted Colleen.  “The problem is that some of the vendors are 
running accounting software that forces them to generate and send an invoice. 
We’ve talked to some of them about this, but it’s just too expensive for some of 
them to change systems to meet the needs of only one customer.  Still, it’d sure 
 
be nice to do something about that.” 
 
“Anyway”, continued Colleen, “let’s try to nail down what happens once the PO 
gets to the analyst.  Nicole, you’ve been working as an analyst for 5 years, how 
 
do you see the process?” 
 
“Well, said Nicole, “the first thing I have to do is check to see whether it’s a PFR 
 
item or not.” 
 
“Why on earth is that?” asked Bill.  “We’ve already checked for that in the 
 
mailroom.” 
 
“Yes, and you do a good job of catching almost all of them”, agreed Nicole. 
“Still”, she observed tactfully, a PFR item does slip through from time to time, so 
 
we still have to check.” 
 
“Nicole, how long does it take to check whether or not an item is PFR?” asked 
 
Colleen. 
 
“Well”, said Nicole, you know that we have to get into the SAP system to look it 
up.  Probably, on average, that takes about 6 to 7 minutes.” 
 
 
“Okay”, said Colleen.  “And if it is a PFR item, you toss it just like they do in the 
mailroom and otherwise it gets processed.  So how do you see the rest of the 
process going?” 
 
 
“What happens next”, stated Nicole “is that I determine whether or not it is ready 
to pay.  If it is, I send it to Input where it is paid and the records are batched and 
microfilmed.  If it isn’t ready to pay, then I put it in a pile on my desk to work on 
later.  When the issue is resolved, it goes to input where it is paid, and then the 
records are batched and microfilmed.” 
 
 
“Why do you put it in a pile to work on later?” asked Colleen.  “Couldn’t you just 
 
work on it immediately?”

“Well, sure”, said Nicole.  “Whether I work on it immediately or not, it takes about 
a minute to resolve.  But the thing is, if I do work on it immediately, it throws me 
completely off my stride in checking for Ready to Pay.  All of us analysts have 
tried completing the resolution before continuing on with the Ready to Pay 
checks, but it just doesn’t seem to work---it slows us up way too much.  So 
setting the items needing resolution aside until we complete the entire batch of 
Ready to Pay checks seems to be the only way to go.” 
 
 
The meeting continued for several more hours.  At the end of that time, Colleen 
had painstakingly collected the data shown in Tables 2 and 3.  Colleen and 
Joanie met once more to discuss the results of the VSM and decided based on 
the VSM to initiate an Accounts Payable RPI to determine how best to improve 
the process.  The RPI event was scheduled for 3 days and would require 12 
team members, 2 RPI workshop leaders, and 5 on-call “experts”.  
 
 
Continuous Collaboration with Colleen 
 
 
After the VSM working group had completed mapping the Invoice Resolution 
Process Joanie met once more with Colleen to discuss the results. 
 
 
“Colleen”, Joanie sighed, “Good job on the Value Stream Map.  Looking at it 
reminds me of something you said during our walk-through. It’s been nagging at 
me, and I hope you can clear this up for me.  You said that some of the people 
on the phones were responding to inquiries from vendors who had been paid 
incorrectly.  I thought our payment procedures were pretty good, and it surprises 
me that there would be a significant number of payment errors.  Do you have any 
idea what our error percentage is and what is causing these errors?” 
 
 
“Well”, said Colleen, “I’m not sure of the exact error percentage, but I’d estimate 
it as around 5 percent.  Even worse, that’s 5% of our PFR items, not 5% of our 
non-PFR items.  So every time we have an error, one of my analysts has to 
spend a bunch of time running down what the right amount is and making the 
appropriate corrections.” 
 
 
“How much time”, asked Joanie, “is that chewing up?” 
 
 
“The analyst can spend anywhere from a few minutes to several hours 
researching a given issue”, noted Colleen, “but 30 minutes is a reasonable 
average figure”. 
 
 
“As you know”, mused Joanie, “payment on PFR items is based on combining a 
PO with a recorded receipt by receiving and the whole process is automated, so 
there should never be any errors on our (Rockwell’s) end unless one of the two 
inputs is fouled up.”

“Why should either of those inputs be wrong?”, asked Colleen. 
 
 
“I’m not sure”, noted Joanie, “but it’s something I want you to pay close attention 
to in the RPI event once we get it off the ground.  Even if you can’t nail every 
possible cause down exactly, you should be able to come up with some pretty 
 
reasonable ideas that we can follow up on.” 
 
“In addition”, Joanie continued, “I’m really curious about how much of our total 
analyst capacity is tied up in dealing with  these erroneous PFR items. 
Furthermore, if we could eliminate doing so, what impact would there be on our 
total flow time?  As you know, right now it’s running over 6 weeks which is 
completely unacceptable.” 
 
 
To gain approval for the RPI, Joanie had to meet with her management one more 
time. 
 
 
 
 Another meeting with Don and (this time) Dave 
 
 
“We’re going to approve your proposed RPI”, said Don. 
 
Don had told Joanie her main objective with the accounts payable RPI had to be 
to reduce cycle time on paying accounts.  
 
 
“It’s key”, he had emphasized, “that we develop a standard process for document 
invoice resolution that doesn’t exceed 10 days.  If you can get it shorter, then so 
much the better. You should also make sure that you establish a training plan for 
everyone whose work is affected by anything you change.  Finally, we need to 
formalize how we are going to communicate requirements for invoice payments 
 
to our suppliers.” 
 
In the same meeting, Don’s supervisor Dave Brehm who was VP, Finance and 
 
Corporate Controller had given Joanie some additional input. 
 
“Whatever you do”, Dave had emphasized, “it’s got to be accommodated within 
our new SAP system.  Any software or information technology you think you 
 
need has got to be based on systems already available inside the company.   
Additionally, all action items need to be completed within 30 days.  Finally, 
there’s no way I can authorize any additional staff.  I want you to know, however, 
that I’m impressed with the thoroughness of your planning and follow-through on 
this.” 
 
 
Finally Making it to Lunch. 
 
 
As they ate lunch, Tom and Joanie discussed what Joanie had learned since 
meeting with Don and Dave.

“Tom, I wonder”, mused Joanie, “why it is that our total flow times are so long.  
Just looking at the average processing times for each individual step, it seems 
like we ought to get things done quicker than we do.” 
 
 
“That is a real non-plusser”, agreed Tom.  “Maybe we can raise that question at 
next week’s RPI.  At first, I thought it might be because our assignment of 
companies to analysts might be unbalanced, but looking at the yearly totals, it 
seems that you’ve split the workload pretty evenly amongst the analysts.” 
 
 
“Maybe”, continued Joanie, “it has something to do with the fact that the analysts 
are spending a lot of their time responding to vendor inquiries.  They sure do 
spend a lot of time on the phones with vendors.  What makes it worse is when an 
analyst is sick or goes on vacation.” 
 
 
“What do you mean?” asked Tom. 
 
 
“Just to give you an instance”, responded Joanie, “last month Rhonda was out for 
3 weeks on her annual vacation.  During those three weeks nothing got done on 
any of the accounts for the companies she handles.  Part of the problem is that 
every analyst uses a completely different filing system.  Nobody could find the 
information to let any of Rhonda’s vendors know what their status was on any of 
 
their past due invoices when they called.” 
 
 
“I see,” said Tom.  “And so stuff just piles up on their desk while they’re gone.”  
 
“It’s even worse than that”, Joanie observed as she finished off her cream of 
vegetable soup and started in on her salad.  “In a few cases, vendors called and 
nobody could find any record of their invoice having ever been entered into the 
system.  We had to tell them to re-send the invoice; and when it arrives we’ll 
have to start the whole process from scratch.” 
 
 
“Well,” observed Tom, it sounds like the RPI event has some good issues to go 
to work on.  Let me know if I can help.”
