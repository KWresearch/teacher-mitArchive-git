Lean Healthcare Simulation 
Segment I: 
Baseline Performance 

Learning Objectives 

At the end of this module, you should be able 
to: 
• Explain the mechanics and rules of the simulation 
• Execute the process in the simulation 
• Experience the difficulties and convey the 
frustrations inherent in a relatively uncontrolled 
process 
• Apply several simple lean tools to improve clinic 
performance

 US Healthcare - A Value Crisis 

• Lean Six Sigma can increase healthcare value delivery by: 
• Improving healthcare quality 
• Decreasing healthcare costs 
• It is one piece of a puzzle to solve the US healthcare crisis

Creating flow: 
• Focus on what is flowing through the process 
• Eliminate bottlenecks, minimize buffers

 Let Customers Pull Value 

• In a Push system, each activity delivers its output 
when it is done. 
• Results in build up of batches with lots of 
inventory.  Defective goods pile up 
• In a Pull system every activity delivers its output 
just as the next activity needs its input. 
• Triggered by the end customer 
• Results in smooth flow with no batches or voids 
• Minimizes inventory and rework due to defects. 
• Pull systems can be implemented in material flow 
using a Kanban approach. 
• Implementation for people flow is more challenging

Lean is not a set of tools. It is a continuous 
improvement mindset using multiple PDSA cycles.

Simulation Progression 
• Segment I: Baseline performance 
• Learn and practice the rules  
We are here 
• Use simple lean tools to improve legacy process 
• Segment II: Applying Lean locally 
• Create a process map and add data for a simple VSM 
• Find waste and bottlenecks 
• Devise clinic process improvement plan 
• Execute and stabilize the improved process 
• Segment III: Applying Lean across clinics 
• Face external disruptions and enterprise issues 
• Improve enterprise performance with Rapid Process 
Improvement and Daily Management System

Learn the simulation 

• The simulation rules are straightforward but 
interact in complex ways 
• It is important that you execute the basic rules 
correctly so that you can concentrate in future 
rounds on the simulated process 
• Your table facilitators will walk you through 
the simulation rules

Metrics and Visual Control 

• Create an Easel chart to 
record your progress 
• On the x-axis, put 6 
rounds 
• On the y-axes, put  
0 to 10 patients, and  
0 to +15 minutes 
• Track patients treated, 
errors (patients 
untreated or treated 
incorrectly) and cycle 
times (average and 
worst)

6S and Standard Work 

• Sort, Safe, Straighten, Scrub, Standardize, 
Sustain 
• Goes beyond clean-ups and neatening 
 
• Standardization is particularly important in 
environments with high variation and 
creative/skilled work 
• Standardize the steps and NVA tasks so that 
time and effort can be concentrated on the VA 
tasks 
• Eliminate unneeded decisions to lower the 
“Chaos” level

Standardizing your 
process 
• Take a few minutes with your table to attempt 
to standardize your process execution  
• Make sure you understand and execute your 
individual process correctly 
• Standardize interactions with other parts of the 
clinic? 
• Sort, Straighten, Scrub and Safe your work 
area 
• Are there any simple visual controls to 
improve your process flow?

Segment 1 Thinking Points  

 
• Could you see the process? 
 
• Could you see the bottlenecks? 
• Queuing/Inventory/Waiting 
• Transport, Complexity, etc. 
 
• Do simple lean tools help you execute the process 
(even if it has problems that the simple tools  
cannot fix)? 
 
• We will return to the sim to fix some of these 
problems after we learn a bit more…
