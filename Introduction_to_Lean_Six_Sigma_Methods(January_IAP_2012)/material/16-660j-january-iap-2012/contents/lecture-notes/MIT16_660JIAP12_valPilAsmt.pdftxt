1. Introduction 
 
 
 
1.1 Purpose 
The LAI Lean Healthcare Academy™ Virtual Assessment of Lean User Experience 
(VALUE) Proficiency Index Level (PIL) assists LAI Lean Healthcare Academy students 
in quantitatively assessing their level of proficiency in ten Knowledge Areas before and 
after taking the course. By providing a quantitative measure of proficiency, an individual 
may communicate their capability to others using a simple metric characterizing their 
lean knowledge at any point in time. 
 
1.2 Usage 
 
VALUE PIL has several usages, including: 
 
•	  Assessing a student’s proficiency before enrolling in a LAI Lean Healthcare 
 
Academy course. 
 
 
•	  Assessing a student’s proficiency at the completion of a LAI Lean Healthcare 
 
Academy course. 
 
•	  Assessing the LAI Lean Healthcare Academy graduate’s continuing growth in 
proficiency, e.g. during a summer internship, after a period of employment, or 
 
after continuing education. 
 
•	  Communicating to other stakeholders the material covered in a LAI Lean 
Healthcare Academy course and the expected level of proficiency achieved by 
 
the graduates. 

 
VALUE PIL is not intended to be a “grade report” or other device for evaluating the 
 
performance of a student taking the LAI Lean Healthcare Academy course. 
 
1.3 Expectations 
It is expected that students completing a LAI Lean Healthcare Academy will have a 
 
VALUE PIL level of at least 2 in all the Knowledge Areas, and to have reached a level 3 
for some Knowledge Areas.  This would give an over all VALUE PIL level in the mid 2 
 
range for a typical LAI Lean Healthcare Academy graduate. 
 
Entering LAI Lean Healthcare Academy students will have a range of VALUE PIL levels 
depending on their previous exposure to, and experience with Lean principles. In some 
cases students may have had no exposure at all and will have an entering VALUE PIL 
level close to zero. This is quite acceptable, as the LAI Lean Healthcare Academy 
curriculum assumes no prior knowledge in the subject area. On the other hand, if an 
entering student has a VALUE PIL level higher than 2.5, they should consider if their 
time will be well spent by enrolling in the course.

2. Lean Enterprise Knowledge Areas 
 
 
 
 
 
The topics covered in the LAI Lean Healthcare Academy curriculum are grouped into 
the ten Knowledge Areas. These do not represent specific modules as the topics are 
interspersed across 15 instructional modules, 2 guest speakers, and an A3 exercise. 
 
The Knowledge Areas are: 
 
 
1  Context for Lean in healthcare 
 
 
2  Healthcare enterprises 
 
 
3  Lean six sigma fundamentals 
 
 
4  Process and value stream fundamentals 
 
 
5  Fundamental principles of lean thinking 
 
 
6  Lean sigma methods 
 
 
7  Lean six sigma tools 
 
 
8  Lean six sigma applications in healthcare 
 
 
9  People and organizations in healthcare 
 
 
10  Implementing lean in healthcare 
 
 

 
 
3. Proficiency Levels 
 
 
 
Proficiency levels used in the VALUE PIL are based upon MIT’s CDIO Proficiency 
Levels1. They are: 
 
 
 
 
 
0  UNAWARE To have no exposure to or knowledge of 
 
 
 
To have experienced or been exposed to 
1  AWARE 
 
 
 
2  READY 
To be able to participate in and contribute to 
 
 
 
3  CAPABLE  To be able to understand and explain 
 
 
 
4  SKILLED  To be skilled in the practice or implementation of 
 
 
 
5  EXPERT  To be able to lead or innovate in 

 
4. Instructions for VALUE usage 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The VALUE PIL is a guide for YOU to use to track your progress on gaining and using 
Lean Healthcare knowledge.  It is important that you be careful and thoughtful when 
deciding on your proficiency level in each area to accurately represent your capability. 
Be honest with yourself as you think about your capability. It is better to err on 
understating your capability rather than misleading yourself, thinking that you are more 
proficient than you really are. A fundamental tenant of Lean is continuous improvement. 
Everyone – even the experts – can always improve.

The CDIO Approach, Springer, New York. See pp 63-66. The CDIO model has five proficiency 
 
 
levels. Proficiency level zero as been added since entering LAI Lean Healthcare Academy 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
students may have no proficiency in a given Knowledge Area.  Each level has also been given a 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
name.

The recommended approach for using the VALUE PIL is to complete the self-
assessment on your own. Start by going through the Knowledge Areas one at a time, 
using the worksheet and referring to the rubrics on the left to gauge your level of 
proficiency.  Each knowledge area contains many topics and you will have to “integrate” 
your knowledge over these topics to arrive at a single measure of proficiency for that 
area.  Thoughtfully reflect on the proficiency levels, asking yourself questions such as 
those listed on the worksheet.  When you arrive at a measure of your proficiency, write 
it in the appropriate box. You may use a first decimal, but don’t go beyond that level of 
detail. For example, if you think your knowledge is close to a 2 in some topics of the 
Knowledge Area, but at a 3 in others, you might write down 2.4 on the worksheet.  
 
 
After you have evaluated yourself in each of the ten knowledge areas sum up your total 
and divide by 10.  Write this down as your “Average Level”.  You will be asked to turn in 
your pre and post LAI Lean Healthcare Academy proficiency levels.  A separate Score 
 
Sheet is provided for that purpose.  Keep the original worksheet for your own records. 
 
 
Suggestion 
 
After completion, take time to discuss this with someone as a closure step to your self-
assessment.  Also discuss with your reviewer ways to improve your proficiency levels 
such as: participating in a Lean improvement activity; obtaining more instruction; 
reading literature from the LAI Lean Healthcare Academy module Reading Lists; or 
attending a Lean workshop. Keep the self-assessment for future reference, and 
 
occasionally revisit it to see how your proficiency has changed.
