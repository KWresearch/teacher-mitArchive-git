What is Plan-Do-Study-Act 
(PDSA)? 

PDSA is: 
 
• Part of a continuous 
improvement culture 
• A problem-solving 
process intended to 
improve the overall 
system 
• A process intended to 
improve the problem 
solving skills of its 
practitioners

Problem: Patients are being incorrectly 
charged for their visits. 
 
• Why?  The charges of another patient with a 
 
similar name may be captured incorrectly 
• Why?  Confusion when more than one name is 
 
used for the patient (i.e., nicknames) 
• Why?  Patient is not admitted with his/her 
registered Medicare name 
 
• Why?  Admissions doesn’t always ask for the 
 
patient’s insurance card 
• Why?  Admission activity is not clearly specified

5 Whys Pitfalls 

Possible pitfalls to be aware of when 
conducting a 5-Whys analysis 
 
• 5 maybe too many or not enough Whys. It is a 
guideline, not a strict requirement 
 
• Results will likely not be repeatable – different 
people may identify different causes for the 
same problem 
 
• Difficult to explore / identify all possible causes 
– you can’t find causes that are outside your 
current knowledge level

Capacity: A Formal Definition 

• Theoretical Capacity: 
Maximum sustainable 
flow rate at an activity 
 
• Effective Capacity: 
Capacity of the activity 
accounting for 
detractors

Process 

• Example: Rework (defects) as a detractor 
 
 
5 patients 
 
per hour 
 
20% rework 
 
• Other detractors include unevenness and 
unreasonableness, multitasking, 
equipment downtime…

• Take 10 minutes to do a root cause analysis 
for your clinic’s operation 
• Identify the causes that can be remedied 
using lean principles and tools introduced 
yesterday.  
• Capture results on an easel chart, and present 
your results to your table facilitator 

Devise Root Cause Treatment 
Options 

• Brainstorm possible options 
• Avoid jumping to solutions 
• Consider multiple options 
• Seek to prevent recurrence of the problem 
• Avoid “workarounds” 
• Consider cost and resource constraints 
• PICK charts  - simple and intuitive prioritization 
• Pareto charts - data driven prioritization 
• Cost/Benefit analysis - prioritization based 
upon return on investment

Visualize Future State 

• Visualize the new process with a Future State 
Value Stream 
• New process may have similar  
value stream but different operations or  
resources OR 
• A different work flow which can be best 
visualized with a new value stream 
• Future State Value Stream can also be an 
exploratory tool 
• Extreme is to consider the Ideal State Value 
Stream – what would the best possible process 
look like?

• Create an Implementation Plan 
• A road map that outlines our movement from 
the current state to the future state 
• Identifies who will do what and by when 
• Develop a Follow Up Plan 
• How will results be verified? 
• When will the results be verified? 
• What data will be collected? 
• Who will the results be shared with? 
• Obtain Stakeholder Buy In 
• For now, you need the approval of your table 
facilitator for your improvement plan

Lean Healthcare Introduction PI.22s - Slide 20 © 2009 Massachusetts Institute of Technology Title:  What you are talking about. Background Current Situation Goal Analysis Plan Follow - up Why you are talking about it.                        What is the business context? Where do we stand? Where we need to be? Where we want to be? What is the specific change you want to accomplish now? -What is the root cause(s) of the problem? -What requirements, constraints and alternatives need to be considered? Recommendations What is your proposed countermeasure(s)?   What activities will be required for implementation and who will be responsible for what and when? How we will know if the actions have the impact needed? What remaining issues can be anticipated? Toyota A3 Sheet APDSTeam Exercise 

You will devise a change plan for the simulated 
clinic, following the CPI framework 

 
• Devise “treatment” (improvement) options 
 
• Create implementation plan 
 
• Present it to your table facilitator  
to obtain “stakeholder buy-in” 

Simulation Progression 
• Segment I: Baseline performance 
• Learn and practice the rules 
• Use simple lean tools to improve legacy process 
• Segment II: Applying Lean locally 
• Create a process map and add data for a simple VSM 
• Find waste and bottlenecks 
• Devise clinic process improvement plan 
We are here 
• Execute and stabilize the improved process 
• Segment III: Applying Lean across clinics 
• Face external disruptions and enterprise issues 
• Improve enterprise performance with Rapid Process 
Improvement and Daily Management System

Notes on Value  
in the Simulation 

• Value is created by admitting and discharging 
patients with correct treatment 
• Correct Treatment is defined as having all dots in 
the right order on the chart  
• Dots = testing or treatments 
• Patients are happiest if this happens in minimum 
time 
• Other stakeholders (insurers, clinic, other 
caregivers) require all paperwork to be done 
correctly

Notes on Process Changes  
in the Simulation 
• Sorry, can’t change the hourglass speed  
(or skip them) 
• This is the details of the Value Added tasks, which we 
NOT addressing 
• Correct treatment is defined as having all dots in 
the right order on the chart - can’t change this 
• Dots = testing or treatments 
• CANNOT change who administers which dots 
• Steps, including routing decisions, must be made 
by qualified personnel 
• Paperwork must be completed  
• May change its form (in a later round), but information 
must be captured for records and billing 

Continuous Process Improvement V7.6 - Slide 29

What goes where 

• Patients need to be in a waiting room or 
process location (treatment, exam, etc.) 
• Can’t queue in the hall 
• You can make more waiting rooms… 
• Paperwork needs to be in a file room or 
process location (same capacity as 
patients) 
• Can’t be left “out” or in the waiting room due 
to confidentiality  

 
  

Continuous Process Improvement V7.6 - Slide 30 
© 2012 Massachusetts  Institute of Technology 

Process Change 

• Almost always involves routing  
• Can’t omit hourglasses or operations involving dots 
• Personnel must be qualified to make decision 
• Not free (fee noted on chart) 
• New process must be written on index card and 
retained for audit  
 
  

Continuous Process Improvement V7.6 - Slide 31

Cross- 
Training 

• Cross-training allows personnel to get 
outside of their usual roles 
• For now, cross-training allows 
• Admins to do either admit or discharge work 
• RNs to do Admin work, and/or make certain 
routing calls currently done by MDs  
(but only if no red dots are involved) 
• MDs to do Triage work 
• We will consider Teamwork (which also 
requires cross-training) later 
 
  

Continuous Process Improvement V7.6 - Slide 32

Hiring 

• Can hire more of the same type of people, 
plus some special ones 
• Patient Advocate helps Admin’s and Triage 
with difficult cases 
• Extern - helps MD  
 
  

Continuous Process Improvement V7.6 - Slide 33

Purchasing 

• Can buy more equipment 
• Resource cards (same, or improved models) 
• Bins, Timers - 10 each 
• Biometric ID tags - 50 
 
  

$950 each 

$10 each  $50 set of 60

Wrap Up 

• PDSA anchors a continuous improvement – 
and continuously learning - culture 
• Use a structure problem solving process like 
the Continuous Process Improvement 
Framework 
• Lean Thinking concepts and tools can 
improve process flow when thoughtfully 
applied 
• Change plans should be carefully selected and 
documented
