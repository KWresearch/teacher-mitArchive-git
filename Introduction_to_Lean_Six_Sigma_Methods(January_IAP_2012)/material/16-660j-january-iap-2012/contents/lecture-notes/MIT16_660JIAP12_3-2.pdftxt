The Impact of Variation 

• Variation impacts 
• Cycle time & throughput 
(Accounts Payable module) 
• Cost of Quality  
  (Quality module) 
• Process capability  
(Six Sigma module) 
• Reducing process  
variation is a key step in 
implementing lean 
practices

Learning About Variation 
• In this module, we will gain understanding 
about impact of variation through two 
simulations 
• Dice game will give experiential encounter 
• Computer simulation will rapidly show impact of 
process changes 
• We’ll discover some important connections 
between variation and WIP, cycle time, 
throughput and utilization 
• The Quality and Six Sigma Modules will 
introduce tools for controlling variation and 
its impact on process capability

A “Perfect” System? 

• Imagine a system that is perfectly balanced, has 
no rework, and has just enough capacity to meet 
customer demand 
• This module uses labels from the AP case study and/or the 
Clinic Lego® simulation, but this could be any system! 
• The only imperfection we allow is variability in 
both input and process 
• How will this system behave?  Let’s find out…

PFR Check rolls a ‘5’, passes 3 chips to Analyst 
Analyst rolls a ‘1’, passes 1 chip to Pay 
Pay rolls a ‘6’, passes 3 chips to the Archive

Accounting Example – 
Analyst  
• Each round, record invoices 
completed and Work In Progress 
(WIP) level on your sheet 
• From our example 
• Analyst at start of 
Day 1 had 3 WIP 
• Rolls a 1 and 
completes 1 invoice 
• Receives 3 invoices 
from PFR check and 
ends day with 5 WIP

What Should happen? 

• Consider 20 time periods, or “days” 
• Each day, 3.5 chips are processed on 
average (the average of  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) 
• Intuitively, what  should be the average 
throughput? Over 10 days?  Over 20? 
• What is the ideal flow (elapsed) time? 
 

Let’s find out what really happens…

Accounting 

• After 20 days, each person should add the 
appropriate columns to carry out the 
calculations at the bottom of their tally 
sheet 
 
• The customer does slightly more complex 
calculations (use calculator if needed) 
 

Let’s tabulate some results

Questions 

• Why are fewer jobs processed than 
expected?  Why is cycle time longer? 
 
• Statistical fluctuations 
 
• Information that cannot be precisely predicted, 
varies from one instance to the next  
 
• System dependencies 
 
• Doing one task depends on having done another  
 
• Can’t make up for lost capacity 
 
 
• How might the performance of this system 
be improved?

Computer Simulation 

• We can more rapidly gather experimental data 
with a computer simulation of the dice game 
 
• We can easily change customer input and 
process step variation to see the impact. 
 
• Look at the impact of input and process 
variability on cycle time after 20 and 216 days

Queue  Time 

• Based on the equation for queue time, 

 
• CVa is input variation  
• Which we may not control 
• CVp is process variation 
• Which we want to minimize 
• Utilization is demand/capacity 
• Note to be “efficient” this should be 1… 

Time_in_Queue = Wait time     Activity_Time = Processing time 

Variability Simulation V7.6 - Slide 21

• Heroic 
reductions in 
variability 
required if 
utilization is 
high 
• This is the 
motivation 
behind the 
6-Sigma 
approach 

 

Controlling Variability 

Utilization 

Variability Simulation V7.6 - Slide 22 
© 2012 Massachusetts  Institute of Technology 

• For any variation 
level, some level 
of utilization 
makes queue 
time explode 
• This is muri and 
mura in action 
• Often, slight 
easing makes a 
dramatic 
difference 

Controlling Utilization

Simulation: Summary 

• Simulated the system to examine behavior 
over a longer time period, more replications 
 
• We made several improvements that 
demonstrate the power of a lean philosophy: 
• Reduced INPUT and PROCESS variability 
• Reduced average utilization of system slightly 
• Less variability and some “excess” capacity 
allowed response to customer need - Pull 
• Eliminating variability allowed straight-through 
flow to customer demand - Perfection

Take Aways 

• Variability reduces expected process 
performance. 
 
• Variability can occur in all processes across 
an enterprise, from manufacturing to 
engineering to administrative functions to 
patient care.
