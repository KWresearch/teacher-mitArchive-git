The Start of Your  
Lean Journey 
 

Learning Objectives 

At the end of this module, you will be able to: 
• Explain the origins of Lean and Six Sigma 
• Explain the “6S” lean tool  
• Define Lean, lean enterprise, stakeholders 
• Recognize why lean six sigma principles are 
being implemented in aerospace, healthcare 
and other sectors 
• Express that lean is a “journey” not a “state”

Lean emerged from post-WWII Japanese automobile industry as 
a fundamentally more efficient system than mass production.  

Lean thinking is the dynamic, knowledge-driven, and customer-
focused process through which all people in a defined enterprise 
continuously eliminate waste and create value. 

Adapted from Murman, et. al, Lean Enterprise Value,, Palgrave, 2002.

Comparison of Lean & Six Sigma 
Six Sigma was developed by Motorola in the 1980s to 
systematically improve quality by elimination of defects.

• Waste removal will

Six Sigma is a data driven philosophy and process resulting in dramatic 
improvement in products/service quality and customer satisfaction.

Lean and Six Sigma 
• Lean and Six Sigma are synergistic 
• Lean optimizes flow and strives to eliminate waste 
• Six Sigma stresses quality through the elimination of variation 
in all enterprise processes 
• A unified framework called Lean Six Sigma has emerged 
• Enterprises usually adopt their own name. Some examples: 
• Textron – Textron Six Sigma 
• US Air Force – AFSO21 
• Pratt & Whitney – ACE 
• Boeing – Lean+ 
• New York City Health & Hospitals Corp – Breakthrough 
• Virginia Mason Medical Center – Virginia Mason 
Production System 
 
The LAI Lean Academy® curriculum focuses on 
the fundamental concepts which underpin these 
and other transformation initiatives.

Two major pillars of lean thinking: 
 
1. Continuous Improvement 
2. Respect for People 
 

 

Workers are encouraged to use 
their full capability to improve 
their own work environment

Six Aims for Healthcare 
Improvement 
“Health care should be: 
•Safe 
•Effective 
•Patient -centered 
•Timely 
•Efficient 
•Equitable 
These aims are not new….  
Yet American health care fails 
far too often with respect to 
these aims, despite enormous 
cost and dedication and good 
efforts of millions of American 
healthcare workers”

What are the Boundaries of an

• The enterprise boundaries 
need to be identified: 
Definition is contextual 

• Core enterprise: Entities 
tightly integrated through 
direct or partnering 
agreements. 

• Extended enterprise: 
From customer’s 
customer to supplier’s 
supplier.

that system.
