What is a Process? 

Inputs 

Outputs 

Customer 

Set of actions 
which transform 
inputs to outputs 

 
Suppliers 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Process: A series of actions, changes, or 
functions bringing about a result 

Ref: http://www.dictionary.com, Jan. 8, 2003

Identify the Customer 

• What happens to the outputs of a process? 
 
They go to a CUSTOMER! 
• External customers - are outside an organization,  
money is typically exchanged with external customers 
• End users are customers who pay for an 
operational or consumable product or service 

 
• Internal customers - are inside an organization, 
money is typically not exchanged directly with 
internal customers 
 
• Customers also drive the inputs to a process through 
their needs and requirements

• Only understood processes can be improved 
• Understanding a process is easier when it can be visualized 
• A process map is an organized visualization of all the 
interrelated activities which combine to form a process

No “Right” Answer 

Photo by Earll Murman 
• A process map is a 2-D visualization of a process 
taking place in 3-D space and time 
• Many ways to map even a simple process 
• Goal is to capture and communicate the key 
features of the process 
• Avoid unneeded details of each step

Process Wrap Up 

• Processes underlay everything we do 
 
• Understanding and improving processes is 
the key to improving productivity 
 
• The fundamentals of lean thinking are the 
foundation of modern process improvement

Five Lean Thinking 
Fundamentals 
• Specify value: Value is defined by customer in terms 
of specific products and services 
 
• Identify the value stream: Map out all end-to-end 
linked actions, processes and functions necessary for 
transforming inputs to outputs to identify and 
eliminate waste 
 
• Make value flow continuously: Having eliminated 
waste, make remaining value-creating steps “flow”  
 
• Let customers pull value: Customer’s “pull” cascades 
all the way back to the lowest level supplier, enabling 
just-in-time production 
 
• Pursue perfection: Pursue continuous process of 
improvement striving for perfection 

Ref: James Womack and Daniel T. Jones, Lean Thinking, New York, Simon & Schuster, 1996

Specify Value 
Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull  Perfection 

Value Added Activity  
• Transforms or shapes material or information or people 
• And it’s done right the first time  
• And the customer wants it 

Non-Value Added Activity – Necessary Waste 
• No value is created, but cannot be eliminated based on current 
technology, policy, or thinking 
• Examples: project coordination, regulatory, company mandate, law  

Non-Value Added Activity - Pure Waste 
• Consumes resources, but creates no value in the 
  eyes of the customer 
• Examples: wait time, inventory, rework, excess checkoff, accidents

Is inspection a value added, non value added

activity?

Identify the Value Stream 
Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull  Perfection 

• A value stream is… 
• ALL the linked end-to-end activities that take place 
to deliver value 
• Starts with raw materials or initial information  
• Ends with the end customer/user 
Customer needs/requirements, schedules 

 Material or information or people 

Product or 
service 
valued by 
the 
customer

What Moves In a Value Stream? 
Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull  Perfection 

 In manufacturing… material flows 

 In design & services…information flows 

 In human services…people flow

Analyzing the Value Stream 
Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull  Perfection 
• Muda – Non value added 
• Look for the eight wastes (next slide) 
• Muri – Overburden of people or equipment 
• Results in safety and quality problems 
• Mura – Unevenness  
• Irregular or fluctuating production or workload due 
to poor planning, staffing,  
inoperative equipment,  
missing supplies, or  
irregular demand. 

Mura 

 
• Mura is a root cause 
Muda is an outcome 
Ref: J. Liker, The Toyota Way

1. Over-production 

Eight 
Seven Types of Waste 
Value  Value Stream  Flow  Pull  Perfection 
Creating more material or information or 
tests or treatment than needed 
2. Inventory 
More material or information than needed 
3. Transportation 
Moving material or information or people 
4. Unnecessary movement  Moving employees to access or process 
material or information or patients 
Waiting for material, information or treatment - 
or work in process waiting  to be processed. 
Errors or mistakes causing the effort to 
be redone to correct the problem 
Processing more than necessary to 
produce the desired output 
Losing improvement opportunities by not 
engaging or listening to employees

• “Mistake-proofing is the use of process or design 
features to prevent errors or the negative impact 
of errors” 
Vacuum 
• Healthcare examples: 
• Wristbands 
• Self blunting syringes 
• Automatic wheel chair brake 
• Others: 
• “Left” and “right” side wires 
with different connectors 
• Asymmetric mounting points 
• Break-away gas nozzle with  
auto-shutoff

Andy 

• With your team, take 10 minutes to Identify with 
colored dots the  
Value added process steps 
 
Necessary waste process steps

• Be ready to report your answers to the class, 
including your questions

Go to the Gemba 
Gemba* - the actual place 
• Basic tenet of lean thinking – go to the 
place where work is being done and 
observe first hand the process in action 
• Japanese call this genchi genbutsu, or 
go see for yourself 
• Honda calls this the three actuals 
• Go to the actual place 
• Talk to the actual people 
• Doing the actual work 
• Relying on data and observations 
produced by others does not give a 
complete understanding

* Sometimes the alternate transliteration genba is used.
