What is Six Sigma? 

• A Strategy to improve process quality by 
identifying and eliminating defects and 
minimizing variation in process outputs 
• A data driven approach based on Measurement 
of the process variation  using Statistical 
Process Control 
• A structured Implementation approach based 
on a DMAIC cycle and certified experts 

The goal of Six Sigma is to reduce process variation

Some notable qualities of the 
normal distribution: 
• The mean is also its mode and 
median.  
• 68.27% of the area (green) is 
within one standard deviation of 
the mean. 
• 95.45% of the area (green & 
yellow)  is within two standard 
deviations. 
• 99.73% of the area (green & 
yellow & red) is within three 
standard deviations

Defects 

• “Defect” is defined as any process output that 
does not meet the customer‟s specifications.  
• Improving quality means reducing the defects 
per million opportunities (DPMO).  There are 
two attributes to this metric that can be 
controlled: 
• Opportunities – reducing the number of steps, 
handoffs and other “opportunities” will help 
improve quality 
• Defects – reducing the number of defects for 
each process step through continuous process 
improvement will help improve quality

Statistical Process 
Control 

• Control charting is the primary tool of SPC 
• Control charts provide information about the 
stability/predictability of the process, 
specifically with regard to its: 
• Central tendency (to target value) 
• Variation 
• SPC charts are time-sequence charts of 
important process or product characteristics

 Class 
Exercise 

• Pharmacy wants to monitor the dispensing of doses of 
White Bean Medicine 
• A 3 cup sample will be taken each day and weighed and 
recorded on a check sheet 
• Data will be entered into two control charts (one for means 
or averages and one for range) 
• Data for the first twenty days will establish the current 
process capability 
• From then on, the pharmacy will monitor the dosages by 
entering daily samples into the control chart 
• Process improvements will be made as needed, based 
upon data collected.

• Select three cups with the same 
sample number (day) 
• Weigh each on the digital scale 
• Record the data on the check 
sheet form and calculate the mean 
(average) and report the results to 
the instructor 
• Also report the lowest and highest 
weights for each day. Calculate 
range = highest - lowest

 Six Sigma Process - DMAIC 

• Define  
• Who are the customers and what are their requirements 
• Identify key characteristics important to the customer 
• Measure  
• Categorize key input and output characteristics, verify 
measurement systems 
• Collect data and establish the baseline performance 
• Analyze  
• Convert raw data into information to provide insights 
into the process 
• Improve  
• Develop solutions to improve process capability and 
compare the results to the baseline performance 
• Control   
• Monitor the process to assure no unexpected changes 
occur

• DMAIC is easy to see in process control applications 
• The same steps can be used to analyze more complex 
systems, often in tandem with lean tools

Types of Process Variation 

• Common Cause Variation is the sum of many 
„chances causes,‟ none traceable to a single 
major cause. Common cause variation is 
essentially the noise in the system. When a 
process is operating subject to common cause 
variation it is in a state of statistical control.  

  
• Special Cause Variation is due to differences 
between people, machines, materials, methods, 
etc. The occurrence of a special (or assignable) 
cause results in an out of control condition.  
Control charts provide a means for distinguishing between 
common cause variability and special cause variability

What To Do 
Phase II Process Monitoring 
• Draw control limits on your chart 
based on the first 20 samples. 
• Weigh a new sample (3 cups), 
record the data on the 2nd check 
sheet and calculate the average 
and range. 
• Plot the average and range on 
the charts, and decide if the 
process is in control. 
• If the process goes out of 
control, stop and investigate the 
cause using a fishbone diagram.

Input 

Measurement System 

• In early stages, control charts (usually on output variables) 
are used to understand the behavior of the process 
• After corrective actions, place charts on critical input 
variables

Measurement System 

• The goal: Monitor and control inputs and, over time, 
eliminate the need for SPC charts by having 
preventative measures in place 
• If a chart has been implemented, remove it if it is not 
providing valuable and actionable information

Process Capability 

• “Process Capability is broadly defined as the 
ability of a process to meet customer 
expectations” (Bothe, 1997) 
 
• Once we have a process in control then we can 
answer the question of whether the process is 
capable of meeting the customer‟s 
specifications.

Customer and Process 
Quality Defined  
• Process Quality is a measure of the capability of 
a process to produce to its expected capability 
• The upper and lower values between which the 
process must be controlled are known as 
upper and lower control limits (UCL and LCL) 
• Customer Quality is the conformance to 
customer specifications within a tolerance band 
• The upper and lower values that the customer 
is willing to accept are known as upper and 
lower specification limits (USL and LSL) 

 

How can we assure Process Capability?

Assessing Process Capability 

Cp, a term used to define 
process capability,  is 
mathematically expressed 
by: 

The figure shows centered  
distributions with various 
Cp levels.  Note Cps less  
than two have visible tails 
outside the acceptable limits.

Bad 

Bad 

Non-Centered Distributions 

Center 

If the distribution is off center, 
the probability of a bad result 
drastically increases.  In this 
case Cpk is used. It is the 
smaller  of 

or 

This figure shows the same   
distributions off-center by 
1.5.  The Cpks are smaller 
than the corresponding Cps.  
This illustrates the need to 
both control variation and 
accurately hit the desired 
mean.

Cp versus Cpk 

In this case, the shooter 
(archer) has a bad eye – 
the shots are widely 
dispersed and slightly off-
center 

Cp is high 
Cpk is high 

Cp is low 
Cpk is low 

In this case, the shooter 
(archer) has a good eye, 
but all the shots are off-
center 

In this case, the shooter 
(archer) has a good eye, 
and has now adjusted the 
gun (bow) sight to bring the 
shots on target 

Cp is high 
Cpk is low

Implications of a Six Sigma 
Process 
Six Sigma is defined as 3.4 defects per  million 
opportunities, or a first pass yield of 99.9997% 

With a Six Sigma process even a significant shift 
in the process mean results in very  few defects

• Six Sigma is an effective quality system 
• Widely deployed in manufacturing 
• Actively being pursued in healthcare 
• Control charts are an effective visual aid in 
monitoring process capability 
• Other SPC analysis tools are available 
• If “customer” specifications for process quality 
(USL, LSL) can be established, Six Sigma 
methods can help achieve desired outcomes.
