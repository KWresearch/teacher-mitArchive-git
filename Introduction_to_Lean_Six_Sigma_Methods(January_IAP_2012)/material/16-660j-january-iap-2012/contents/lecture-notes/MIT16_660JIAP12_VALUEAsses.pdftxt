1. Introduction 
 
 
1.1 Purpose 
The LAI Lean Academy™ Virtual Assessment of Lean User Experience (VALUE) 
assists LAI Lean Academy students in quantitatively assessing their level of proficiency 
in twelve Lean Enterprise Knowledge Areas. By providing a quantitative measure of 
proficiency, an individual may communicate their capability to others using a simple 
metric characterizing their lean knowledge at any point in time. 
 
1.2 Usage 
 
VALUE has several usages, including: 
 
•	  Assessing a student’s proficiency before enrolling in a LAI Lean Academy. 
 
 
 
 
•	  Assessing a student’s proficiency at the completion of a LAI Lean Academy. 
 
•	  Assessing the LAI Lean Academy graduate’s continuing growth in proficiency, 
e.g. during a summer internship, after a period of employment, or after continuing 
 
education. 
 
•	  Communicating to other stakeholders the material covered in a LAI Lean  
 
Academy and the expected level of proficiency achieved by the graduates.  

 
VALUE is not intended to be a “grade report” or other device for evaluating the 
 
performance of a student taking the LAI Lean Academy course. 
 
1.3 Expectations 
It is expected that students completing a LAI Lean Academy will have a VALUE level of 
at least 2 in all the Lean Enterprise Knowledge Areas, and in many of these to have 
reached a level 3.  This would give an over all VALUE level in the mid 2 range for a 
 
typical LAI Lean Academy graduate. 
 
Entering LAI Lean Academy students will have a range of VALUE levels depending on 
their previous exposure to, and experience with Lean principles. In some cases 
students may have had no exposure at all and will have an entering VALUE level close 
to zero. This is quite acceptable, as the LAI Lean Academy curriculum assumes no prior 
knowledge in the subject area. On the other hand, if an entering student has a VALUE 
level higher than 2, they should consider if their time will be well spent by enrolling in the 
 
course. 
 
1.4 Scope and Organization 
The Lean Enterprise Knowledge Areas used in the VALUE are covered in Section 2. 
 
Proficiency Levels that measure student capability in each Lean Enterprise Knowledge 
 
Area are described in Section 3. 
 
Section 4 contains instructions for individuals to complete a self-assessment of their 
 
proficiency in the Lean Enterprise Knowledge Areas using the score sheet.

3. Proficiency Levels 
 
 
 
Proficiency levels used in the VALUE are based upon MIT’s Conceive Design 
Implement Operate (CDIO) Syllabus1. They are2: 
 
 
 
0  UNAWARE To have no exposure to or knowledge of 
 
 
 
 
To have experienced or been exposed to 
 
1  AWARE 
 
To be able to participate in and contribute to 
 
 
2  READY 
3  CAPABLE  To be able to understand and explain 
 
 
 
4  SKILLED  To be skilled in the practice or implementation of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5  EXPERT  To be able to lead or innovate in 

 
4. Instructions for VALUE usage 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The VALUE is a guide for YOU to use to track your progress on gaining and using Lean 
Enterprise knowledge.  It is important that you be careful and thoughtful when deciding 
on your proficiency level in each area to accurately represent your capability. Be honest 
 
with yourself as you think about your capability. It is better to err on understating your 
capability rather than misleading yourself, thinking that you are more proficient than you 
really are. A fundamental tenant of Lean is continuous improvement. Everyone – even 
 
the experts – can always improve.

2  The CDIO Syllabus contains five proficiency levels. Proficiency level zero as been added since  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
entering students may have no proficiency in a given Lean Enterprise Knowledge Area.  Names  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for each level have also been added.

The recommended approach for using the VALUE is to complete the self-assessment 
on your own, and then subsequently discuss your results with a person such as a 
supervisor, mentor, LAI Lean Academy instructor, or peer. Start by going through the 
Lean Enterprise Knowledge Areas one at a time, using the worksheet and referring to 
the rubrics on the left to gauge your level of proficiency.  Each knowledge area contains 
many topics and you will have to “integrate” your knowledge over these topics to arrive 
at a single measure of proficiency for that area.  Thoughtfully reflect on the proficiency 
levels, asking yourself questions such as those listed on the worksheet.  When you 
arrive at a measure of your proficiency, write it in the appropriate box. You may use a 
first decimal, but don’t go beyond that level of detail. For example, if you think your 
knowledge is close to a 2 in some topics of the knowledge area, but at a 3 in others, you 
might write down 2.4 on the worksheet. 
 
 
After you have evaluated yourself in each of the 12 knowledge areas sum up your total 
and divide by 12.  Write this down as your “Average Level”.  You will be asked to turn in 
your pre and post LAI Lean Academy proficiency levels.  A separate Score Sheet is 
 
provided for that purpose.  Keep the original worksheet for your own records. 
 
 
Suggestion 
 
After completion, take time to discuss this with someone as a “closure” step to your self-
assessment.  Also discuss with your reviewer ways to improve your proficiency levels 
such as: participating in a Lean improvement activity; obtaining more instruction; 
reading literature from the LAI Lean Academy module Reading Lists; or attending a 
Lean workshop. Keep the self-assessment for future reference, and occasionally revisit 
 
it to see how your proficiency has changed.
