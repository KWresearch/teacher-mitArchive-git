1Lean does not light a fire 
under people…it lights a fire 
within them 

Matthew May 

2Why Lean? 

 It is a philosophy – a set of principles 
 It’s a great fit for healthcare 
 It produces meaningful, useful, 
important results 
 It provides the power to change an 
organization’s culture 

3You must ask… 

Is there a better way?

4Lean is 

 The systematic pursuit of perfection 
 A discipline of incremental changes

5Lean transformation happens over 
time – 4, 5, 6 years or more 

 There is no quick, easy way 
 Lean is learned through experiences 
 Clinical and Operational 
 It takes practice, practice, and more 
practice 

6In order for Lean to succeed 
 The entire healthcare team has to 
own it 
 Administrators 
 Middle Managers 
 Staff 
 It must be evident in everyday work 
 It must be embraced and practiced 
by everyone in the organization 
 It must be expected 
 It is not just one or two activities 

7“The significant problems we face cannot be 
solved at the same level of thinking we 
were at when we created them.” 
Albert Einstein 
 

8Why the Toyota Production 
System Model? 
 Most successful auto manufacturer in the world 
 But, can it work for healthcare? 
 Best record of introducing new technology 
 Healthcare has a technological imperative 
 Best record of employee satisfaction 
 Important to have good employee retention in hc 
 Relentless commitment to eliminating waste 
 We have LOTS of waste in healthcare 
 One million suggestions a year/ 90% implemented 
 Who better to tell us what needs fixing than 
healthcare’s front line workers? 

9

9Features of TPS 
 Management is not top-down 
 The traditional healthcare model is “command and 
control” 
 Employees are on the value side of the ledger 
(no lay-offs) 
 When there are budget issues in healthcare, usually 
   
the first thing that is cut is positions 

Very few long meetings! 

10

10Recognize people who do the work as 
experts and allow them to create!

11Imagine what would happen if a hospital 
empowered all of it’s employees 

 to identify problems/issues 
 to identify barriers to good work 
 to allow them to make the needed 
changes 

The power of 1000!! 2000!!! More!! 

12Lean gives employees 

 A purpose 
 A direction 
 A sense of belonging 
 A sense of contributing 
 A different way to think and work 
 An opportunity to build a better 
work environment 

13Why Lean for healthcare? 
 Largest industry in America 
 Cost in 2002: $1.76 trillion 
 Cost in 2009: $2.5 trillion 
 Projected to be $4.5 trillion in 
2019* (19.3% of GDP) 
*Due to job losses and increased
Medicaid recipients and growth in 
Medicare recipients as Baby 
Boomers retire. Medicare spending
will grow 7.4% annually from 2011 
to 2019

16Why does Lean work for healthcare? 

 Massive waste in healthcare 
 Rock solid common sense 
 Easy to learn/teach to frontline workers 
 Easy to apply at the frontline where the 
work is really happening 
 Improvement occurs with the first 
application 

17

17“Everything must be made as simple as possible…but not one bit simpler” 
A. Einstein 

18What can we do with Lean in healthcare? 
 Produce more DEFECT FREE healthcare 

 Reduce/eliminate WASTE and have 
more time to take care of patients 

 Improve WORKPLACE APPRECIATION 
 better staff retention 

 STRENGTHENS LEADERSHIP 

19

19Lean Strengthens Leadership 

 Consistent and reliable tools for 
middle and senior management 

 Consistent communication of 
improvement efforts 

20Ask yourself… 

 Are there things happening to 
patients that should not be 
happening? 

 Are there things not happening to 
patients that should be happening? 

21Defect Free 

 Exactlywhat the patient needs when 
s/he needs it 
 Without errors 
 Safe for everyone 

22

22The 7 Mudas 

 Confusion 
 Motion 
 Waiting 
 Processing 
 Inventory 
 Defects 
 Overproduction 

23

23Confusion 

Clarifying physicians orders 
Medication reconciliation 
Wrong site surgery 

24Motion 

Looking for supplies 
Trying to find a chart 
Multiple tests in various locations 
Nonsensical staffing assignments 
Not having all the equipment you need 

25Waiting 

Waiting for appointments 
Waiting for transport to arrive 
Waiting for the surgeon to arrive 
so the case can start 
Waiting in an ED waiting room 
Waiting for discharge orders 
Waiting for meds to arrive 

26Processing 

Not having meds you need in the Pyxis 
Complex and redundant paperwork 
Insurance nuiances 

27Inventory 

Too much 
Too little 
Not the right things 
Not in the right places 

28To Err Is Human 
Building a Safer Health System

PRESS Washington, D.C. 

29Defects  a.k.a. ERRORS 
  

Over 100,000 hospital deaths due to 
errors each year 

Medication errors 
Failure to rescue errors 
Incorrect identifications 
Wrong site surgeries 
Falls 

30Errors 

Two large studies, one 
conducted in Colorado 
and Utah and the 
other in New York, 
found that adverse 
events occurred in 2.9 
and 3.7 percent of 
hospitalizations, 
respectively. 

31Overproduction 

Different people asking the same questions 
Multiple forms requesting similar 
information 

32IDEAL HEALTHCARE 

 Exactly what the patient needs – no 
more, no less 
 On demand, exactly as requested 
 No waste 
 An immediate response to problems or 
changes 
 Physically, professionally, emotionally 
safe for patients and staff 

33

334 Rules in Use 

Rule 1: All activities of work 
are specified according to: 
 Content 
 Timing 
 Sequence 
 Outcome 

34

344 Rules in Use 

Rule 2: 
All connections in 
the request for a 
service or activity 
are simple and 
direct 

35

354 Rules in Use 
Rule 3: Pathways in the process of 
delivering the request are simple and 
involve as few steps and people as 
possible 

36

364 Rules in Use 

Rule 4: Improvement 
 Direct response to a problem 
 As close to the problem as possible 
(in time and person) 
 All change is first tested as an 
experiment 
 All redesign is done by those doing 
the work 
 Supported by a coach 

37

37The Scientific Method 

 All work redesign is based on DIRECT 
OBSERVATION OF THE WORK 

 Changes done first as experiments 

38

38Socratic Method 

 Observation includes asking the 
worker many questions: 

 How do you know how to do your work? 

 Are there clear signals that cue the 
work? 

 Do all workers do a task the same way? 

39

39A Basic Tenet of TPS 

Deeplyunderstanding how 
work currently happens is 
essential before trying to 
fix it! 

40

40To understand deeply, 
you must observe 

41

41GEMBA* WALKS – GO LOOK AND SEE 

 See the situation with your own 
eyes 
 Use your senses to absorb the 
qualitative side of the problem 
 Experience the environment 
 Immerse yourself in the issue 

Gemba – The actual place; the real place
 

42 Use an Observation Sheet
 
 Draw Spaghetti Diagrams
 

43

4344 The more 
spaghetti, like the
diagram, the
clearer the need 
for redesigned
work! 
 Easy to see wasted

The New Way 

46Understanding the Work 

Value Stream Mapping 
 The view from 10,000 feet 
 Looking at a specific process 
 All activities are recognized as value 
added or non-value added 
 Identifies wherethere are areas of 
inconsistency 
 A springboard for a future state map 

47The Value Stream Map 

 As soon as the request and process 
boxes are drawn we can start to see 
the flowof the work 

 The objective is to fix problems with 
flow 

48The Value Stream Map 

 VSMs identify everyway that a 
request can be made 

49

49Trauma patient coming to ED 

50

50The Value Stream Map 

 When drawing a VSM, it is essential to 
follow the process at least once to 
understand how it really happens 

 Validate your map with other workers 
to assure accurate mapping 

51

51Trauma Patient Flow in ED 

52

52Ways to use Value Stream Maps? 

 To understand each step of a process 
 To identify wherethere are problems 
 To launch specific problem solving 
 To orient new staff to the process 
 To clearly describe the process to 
other departments/authorities 

53

53Takes too long 

54

54Future State Map 

 Use your CURRENT STATE VSM as 
a springboard for drawing your 
FUTURE STATE VSM 
 What do you want the process to look 
like?

57A3 Problem-Solving 

“If you can’t get your thinking 
on one page, you haven’t 
really done your thinking.” 
M May 

58Ask the right questions and the answers 
will come easily

60Frontline Workers and A3S 

 Allows your organization to experiment more 
 Get faster, meaningful results 
 Learning occurs in the course of work 
 Generator of ideas  clusters and 
possibilities 
 Opportunities to cluster ideas into bigger 
ones 
 A3s can be organization-changing 

61Selecting A3 Topics 

 Select first priority area from 
value stream (current state) map 
 Observe! 
 Identify specific issues 
 Prioritize and begin! 

62The A3 Process 
 A view with a microscope 

 A tool for “drilling” down into 
variation in the process 

 Documentation of problem
solving activity 

 It tells the story visually 

63

63Common sense may be your enemy 

 Always temper immediate “knee jerk” 
action with root cause analysis 
 Resist drawing conclusions based on 
emotions 
Question hear-say 
 Draw from experience, but do not 
rely on it 

Taiichi Ono, 
Toyota 

64The A3 and The Pencil 

 Lead is erasable. It gives you the 
opportunity to look at what you drew 
and make changes quickly 

 You can focus on problem solving - not 
on how to use the tool 

 It’s non-threatening when used as a 
boundary tool 

65

65Selecting A3 Topics 

 Select from your current state map 
or… 
 As soon as possible after a problem 
occurs 

66© Lean Healthcare West 2009
 

67The Issue 

Always state the issue through the 
eyes of the customer/patient 

68

68Background 

Explain why this is an  issue 
Include some measurements 

69

69The Current Condition 
Draw how the work happens now, from your observations 
Validate your drawing with affected parties for accuracy and buy-in 

70Add storm clouds as close as possible to  
where they appear on the graphic 

What’s  wrong with the way this work happens now? 
What about this work is not Ideal? 

71Problem (Root Cause) Analysis 

 Review the storm clouds; Consolidate the ones that 
are related to each other 
 Use outline format and ask WHY? 5 times to get 
to the root cause 
PROBLEM ANALYSIS_____________________________________ 
 
1.Anesthesiologists waste time searching for fiber optic  endoscopes
 
a. Why? Fiber optic endoscopes are not always available 
Why? FEs broken when slammed in drawers, dropped on floor, etc. 
 
Why? No designated place for endoscopes 
b. Why? They are placed on top of cart before and after procedures 
Why? There is no way to tell if they are clean or dirty 
Why? No designated location for clean scopes and dirty scopes 

2. Potential danger to patients 
Why? Confusion as to which endoscopes are clean and which are dirty
 
Why? No designated location for clean scopes and for dirty scopes 
 

72Root Causes 

Root causes are actionableitems 

Most of the time root causes can be 
attributed to something not being 
specified (Lean Rule #1) 

73Why the left side is completed first 

 Stupidity is having and answer for 
everything 
Wisdom is having a question for 
everything 

74Thousands of people saw the apple fall…

only Newton asked “Why?” 

7576Where you can use A3 thinking 

1.  Specific problem-solving 
2.  Process redesign 
3.  Documentation of changes for
regulatory bodies 
4.  Capital equipment purchase justification 
5.  Lean meetings 
6.  Employee evaluations 
7.  ????

“Try to figure out a way to do 
something better that is has ever 
been done before.” 
                   
Dan Needham 
Former CEO Jet Blue 

91Identify Leadership Champions 

 Senior Leadership Team member 
responsible for Lean activities 
 Who on your team will ownthis work? 
 Physician champions 
 An Individual? A Committee? 
 Informal Leaders 
 Managers, Supervisors, Staff 

92The Ideal Lean Coordinator 

 Coordinates all Lean activities 
 Based in the Quality/PI Department 
 Has a deep understanding of the 
organization’s philosophy, strategic plan, 
administration and management styles 
 Communicates to SLT/Middle 
Managers/Staff 
 Has great coaching 
and interpersonal 
skills 

93Instead of saying 

“JUST FIX IT” … 

Say, “No one knows this job 
better than you do! How can I 
help?” 

94Ideal Leadership Behaviors 

•  Coach and engage in the work 
•  Respect for all people 
•  Focus on the process 
•  Recognize and reward staff 
•  Lead by example 
•  Create a vision and make it happen! 
•  Commit to achievement of Ideal 
•  Stick to it for the long run 
•  Ignite a culture change in the organization
