<p>Professor Kedlaya provided answers to some of the questions commonly asked by students in the class. The questions, as well as their answers, are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#hypotheses">Are the hypotheses of Hartshorne exercise II.2.18(d) (PS 3) all necessary?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#compactification">Help! I'm stuck on the Stone-Cech compactification (PS 3, problem 2).</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#morphism">For f: X -&gt; Y a morphism and y in Y a point, what is the definition of the scheme-theoretic fibre X_y?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#notation">What does the notation M(n), for M a graded module over a graded ring, mean? I couldn't find the definition in Hartshorne.</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#Theorem">Does the proof of Theorem II.5.4 in Hartshorne work without the noetherian hypothesis?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#compact">Does the definition of "locally compact" used in this course include the Hausdorff condition?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#generated">Let S be a graded ring generated in degree 1. Do the D_+(f) (called D(f) in class) for f in S_1 form a basis of Proj S?</a>

<p>The most difficult part is probably (c). Everything can be found in Bourbaki's <em>Topologie Generale</em>, section 1, or the English translation of same, but you might find that difficult to read because it uses the language of <strong>filters</strong> and <strong>ultrafilters</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is a translation of a key lemma: if f: X -&gt; {point} is proper, then X is quasicompact. Proof sketch: suppose that {U_i} is an open cover of X. Topologize Y = X union {y} with a basis consisting of all subsets of X, plus sets of the form (X - U_{i_1} - ... - U_{i_n}) union {y}. Show that if the closure of {(x,x): x in X} in X x Y has closed image under f x id_Y, then the original cover of X must admit a finite subcover.</p>

<p><strong>Does "stable under base change", for a <a id="property" name="property"></a>property of morphisms of schemes, imply "local on the base"?</strong></p>
<p>It implies only part of that. For a property P of morphisms of schemes, we say P is <strong>stable under base change</strong> if for any morphism f: Y -&gt; X with P, and any morphism Z -&gt; X at all, the morphism Y x_X Z -&gt; Z has P also. If we take Z to be an open subscheme of X, then Y x_X Z is just the inverse image f^{-1}(U) viewed as an open subscheme of Y. So stability under base change implies that if f has P, then so do the maps f^{-1}(U_i) -&gt; U_i for any open cover U_i of X. We say f is <strong>local on the base</strong> if this is true <strong>and</strong> you can go the other way: for any open cover {U_i} of X, if f^{-1}(U_i) -&gt; U_i has P for each i, then f itself has P.</p>

<p><strong>Does the category of schemes admit <a id="arbitrary" name="arbitrary"></a><a id="arbitrary" name="arbitrary"></a>arbitrary (small) colimits?</strong></p>
<p>No, it does not even admit finite colimits. It does admit (small) coproducts via the disjoint union, but in general one cannot construct coequalizers, i.e., colimits of diagrams consisting of two morphisms from X to Y. In the category of sets, the coequalizer of f_1, f_2: X -&gt; Y is defined by taking the equivalence relation generated by the pairs (y_1, y_2) in Y x Y with the property that for some x in X, f_1(y_1)= f_2(y_2); the coequalizer is then the quotient by this equivalence relation. Unfortunately, in the category of schemes, it is possible to have equivalence relations (defined in the appropriate categorical fashion) for which the quotient does not exist. Any Moishezon manifold which is not a scheme gives an example; see the appendices to Hartshorne. (More precisely, an equivalence relation on Y is a scheme R carrying two maps R -&gt; Y satisfying the usual three axioms for an equivalence relation, and such that the induced map R -&gt; Y x Y is an immersion. The quotient by R if it exists is the coequalizer of the two maps R -&gt; Y.) By contrast, the category of <strong>affine</strong> schemes does admit equalizers (and in fact arbitrary small colimits), because the category of rings has arbitrary small limits (reflected from the category of sets).</p>

<p><strong>Can you <a id="explain" name="explain"></a>explain in more detail what the map Spec (B tensor_A B) -&gt; Spec B is in PS 6, problem 4(a)?</strong></p>
<p>Recall that we were given initially a homomorphism f: A -&gt; B of rings. View that as a map of A-algebras, and then tensor over A with B using f. Let's say we're doing this on the right side; you now have a map A tensor_A B -&gt; B tensor_A B computed by a tensor b --&gt; f(a) tensor b. Then identify A tensor_A B with B by identifying 1 tensor b with b.</p>

<p><strong>I'm still having <a id="trouble" name="trouble"></a>trouble with PS 6, problem 4(a) (faithful flat descent along B -&gt; B tensor_A B).</strong></p>
<p>In fact, the argument is the same for any faithfully flat morphism B -&gt; C which admits a splitting C -&gt; B in the category of rings; this might simplify your notation. To wit, let M be a C-module equipped with a descent datum. We claim that the underlying B-module is M tensor_C B; to establish this, we must (among other things) exhibit an isomorphism M -&gt; (M tensor_C B) tensor_B C. We get it from the descent isomorphism M tensor_C (C tensor_B C) -&gt; M tensor_C (C tensor_B C), in which on the left side C operates on the first copy of C in C tensor_B C, and on the right side C acts on the second copy of C in C tensor_B C.</p>
<p>The two sides of the descent isomorphism are modules over C tensor_B C; using the right action of C on C tensor_B C, we view them both as C-modules. What happens if we now tensor with B? The left side of the isomorphism simply becomes (M tensor_C C) tensor_B (C tensor_B B) = M tensor_B B = M. The right side is a bit trickier: we can pull the first C of C tensor_B C all the way to the outside to get C tensor_B (M tensor_C C tensor_C B) = C tensor_B (M tensor_C B). In other words, the descent isomorphism gives us the map M -&gt; (M tensor_C B) tensor_B C that we were looking for.</p>
<p>There is more to do, but I'll leave it to you. You must use the cocycle condition to check that the operation M -&gt; (M tensor_C B) tensor_B C is <strong>functorial</strong> in M. If you get confused, you might want to keep in mind the example k -&gt; k[x] -&gt; k.</p>

<p><strong>How do I show that a finite <a id="surjective" name="surjective"></a>surjective morphism between nonsingular algebraic varieties over an algebraically closed field is finite (Hartshorne exercise III.9.3)?</strong></p>
<p>Note that if x is a nonsingular point on the k-variety X, then the map from the local ring O_{X,x} to its completion is faithfully flat, and the latter is isomorphic to a power series ring k[[x_1, ..., x_n]] by the Cohen structure theorem. Using this, one can reduce to checking: if f: R -&gt; R is a finite morphism for R = k[[x_1, ..., x_n]], then f is flat. To prove this, you may want to use the Auslander-Buchsbaum formula (Hartshorne Proposition III.6.11A); you will need to know that if A -&gt; B is a finite injective morphism of local rings, the depth of a B-module M is the same as the depth of M considered as an A-module.</p>

<p>Suppose the point z in P^n_k has more than one point in its inverse image. Let Z be the closure of z in P^n_k, let y be any point in the inverse image of z, and let Y be the closure of y in X. Since phi is proper, it is a closed map, so phi(Y) is a closed subset of P^n_k contained in Z (by continuity) but containing z (since phi(y) = z). We must thus have phi(Y) = Z. That is, for each point y in phi^{-1}(z), the closure of y in X surjects onto Z. So now we hit trouble: if y_1, y_2 are distinct preimages of Z with closures Y_1, Y_2, then any closed point of Z has one preimage in Y_1 and one in Y_2, which must then coincide. Since closed points are dense in both Y_1 and Y_2 (closed points are dense in any quasiprojective scheme over a field; I think that was an exercise a while back), this forces Y_1 = Y_2. But then y_1 = y_2 since they are the generic points of Y_1 and Y_2, contradiction.</p>

<p><strong>Again in the <a id="proof" name="proof"></a>proof of Hartshorne Proposition II.7.3, while we are trying to prove that phi is projective, Corollary II.5.20 is invoked. But doesn't that statement require phi to be projective already, not just proper?</strong></p>
<p>Yes it does! This is a real problem with the argument. Corollary II.5.20 turns out to be true for a proper morphism, but some proof is required. It can be deduced from Chow's lemma (exercise II.4.10) as follows. (I think this is the approach used in EGA III but I haven't checked yet.)</p>
<p>Namely, if f: X -&gt; Y is proper, then we can find g: X' -&gt; X a birational regular morphism such that X' -&gt; Y is projective. Here birational means that there is a dense open subset U of X over which g is an isomorphism. If F is a coherent sheaf on X, then g^* F is a coherent sheaf on X', so Corollary II.5.20 implies that f_* g_* g^* F is a coherent sheaf on S. There is an adjunction map F -&gt; g_* g^* F which is an isomorphism over U, so the kernel H is supported on X-U. If I can show that f_* H is coherent, then I'll be done because f_* F will then be trapped in an exact sequence between the coherent sheaves f_* H and f_* g_* g^* F. I do this by finding a closed subscheme Z supported on X-U such that H is the pushforward of a coherent sheaf on Z. (What this is saying on affines is that if you have a finitely generated module M over a noetherian ring R, and it is supported entirely on V(I) for some ideal I, then there is another ideal I' with the same support as I such that I'M = 0.) Now I can replace X -&gt; Y with Z -&gt; Y and argue by induction on the dimension of Z.</p>

Then take generators for this ideal and multiply by a suitable power of a to obtain generators of some ideal in k[x,y,z,a]. That only gives you the desired I if k[x,y,z,a]/I is flat over k[a], or equivalently torsion-free. That will fail precisely if there is a-torsion in the quotient, i.e., if you can form a combination of generators of the ideal which is divisible by a, but the result is no longer in the ideal. Once you "saturate" to eliminate the a-torsion in the quotient, you have a flat family.</p>

<p>Suppose your curve has an affine part of the form Spec k[x,y]/(y^2 - P(x)) with P of odd degree 2g+1 having no repeated roots. Then dx/y = 2 dy/P'(x); these two representations together give a section of omega defined everywhere in the affine part where either y or P'(x) are nonzero. But since P has no repeated roots, this is all of the affine part. Moreover, you can compute the order of vanishing of x, y at the unique point at infinity (by rewriting the defining equation in terms of 1/x and 1/y, which are both regular there) and see that dx/y is holomorphic also at infinity.</p>

<p><strong>How do I <a id="compute" name="compute"></a>compute the cohomology in Hartshorne exercise III.2.7(b)?</strong></p>
<p>You may want to use the fact that any open cover can be refined to a finite cover by open intervals, and then further refined by replacing each interval with a subinterval whose closure is contained in the original interval. Then use partitions of unity.</p>

<p><strong><a id="Should" name="Should"></a>Should I be using cohomology to solve Hartshorne III.3.2?</strong></p>
<p>You can do it either with or without cohomology. In both cases, what you should be trying to prove is: if X is reduced and noetherian, and is the union of two disjoint closed subschemes X_1, X_2 which are both affine, then X itself is affine (then argue by induction on the number of components).</p>
<p>For a cohomological argument: one must show that the higher cohomology of a coherent sheaf F on X is zero. Use the ideal sheaves defining X_1 and X_2 to put F in the middle of a short exact sequence.</p>
<p>For a direct argument: put X_1 = Spec R, X_2 = Spec S, X_1 cap X_2 = Spec T; we then have surjective ring homomorphisms R -&gt; T and S -&gt; T. Let U be the kernel of R oplus S -&gt; T; then there is a map X -&gt; Spec U by adjunction, which we want to be an isomorphism. But now we have a claim that we can check locally on Spec U.</p>

<p><strong>I <a id="gather" name="gather"></a>gather that Hartshorne exercise II.1.16(b) requires Zorn's Lemma, but I don't quite understand how to apply it here.</strong></p>
<p>Recall that the statement is: if F is a flasque sheaf on a topological space X, and 0 -&gt; F -&gt; G -&gt; H -&gt; 0 is an exact sequence of sheaves (of abelian groups, say), then Gamma(X, G) -&gt; Gamma(X, H) is surjective. To prove this, choose a section s in Gamma(X, H). We know that X is covered by open sets U such that s lifts to Gamma(U, G). Consider the collection of such open sets U; it has the property that every chain of such open sets has an upper bound (namely its union, by the sheaf axiom). So Zorn's lemma implies that there is a maximal element U, i.e., an open set U such that s lifts to Gamma(U, G) but not to Gamma(V, G) for any open set V properly containing U.</p>
<p>We claim this forces U = X. Suppose the contrary; pick a point x in X not in U. We can then find an open subset V of X containing x such that s lifts to a section t_2 in Gamma(V, G). We already know that s lifts to a section t_1 in Gamma(U, G). After restricting to Gamma(U \cap V, G), we have t_1 - t_2 = 0; so by exactness, this difference lifts to a section u in Gamma(U \cap V, F). By flasqueness of F, this section extends to a section u in Gamma(X, F). So now the restrictions of t_1 and (t_2 + u) to Gamma(U \cap V, G) agree, which means we can glue them to get a section of Gamma(U \cup V, G). This maps to s in Gamma(U \cup V, H) because u maps to 0 as a section of H by exactness of the sequence. This contradicts the choice of U, so we must indeed have U = X.</p>
<p>If you know about ordinals, you might prefer to argue using transfinite induction instead. The idea is the same: if U_i is an increasing sequence of open subsets over which s lifts to a section of G, we can always extend it unless it has a last element equal to X. At nonlimit stages we do this as in the previous argument; at limit stages we do it by taking the union.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a simple solution of PS 9, exercise 1 not using <a id="spectral" name="spectral"></a>spectral sequences?</strong></p>
<p>Yes; here is a solution suggested by Fucheng Tan. Let 0 -&gt; F -&gt; G -&gt; H -&gt; 0 be a short exact sequence of sheaves on U with F as given and G flasque. Claim: the sequence 0 -&gt; F(U) -&gt; G(U) -&gt; H(U) -&gt; 0 is exact, or equivalently, any section s in H(U) lifts to G(U). Proof: we know that U admits a cover by basic open subsets V_i such that the restriction of s to V_i lifts to a section s_i in G(V_i). For each pair i, j, the difference s_i - s_j is the zero section of G(V_i cap V_j), so comes from a unique element f_{ij} of F(V_i cap V_j). Moreover, the f_{ij} form a Cech 1-cocycle for the covering by the V_i, so by our hypothesis on F, they also form a 1-coboundary. That is, there exist g_i in F(V_i) such that g_i - g_j = f_{ij}. Now the sections s_i - g_i in G(V_i) glue to a section in G(U) lifting s.</p>
<p>It follows that 0 -&gt; C-cech(U, F) -&gt; C-cech(U, G) -&gt; C-cech(U, H) -&gt; 0 is exact (since we need only work with basic open coverings). If we take the long exact sequence in cohomology, the first connecting homomorphism is zero (because H-cech^0 = H^0 always and we just checked that the H^0 give an exact sequence) and the higher G terms vanish because G is flasque. Hence H also satisfies the input hypothesis (i.e., it is Cech-acyclic on any basic open). We can now perform a dimension shifting argument: we get the isomorphism H-check^1(U, F) -&gt; H^1(U, F) = 0 by comparing long exact sequences, and the higher ones by comparing to H.</p>
<p>We now know that F is sheaf-acyclic on each basic open U. By the Leray theorem (and the niceness of the basis), it follows that the Cech cohomology of F for any basic open covering computes sheaf cohomology.</p>

<p><strong>Is a coherent sheaf necessarily (locally) <a id="finitely" name="finitely"></a>finitely generated?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that is part of the definition.</p>
<p>^ <a href="#top" class="top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><strong>How do I <a id="get" name="get"></a>get started on PS 11, problem 5(a)?</strong></p>
<p>Remember that the property of a sheaf being finitely generated is by definition a <strong>local</strong> property. So we can check the finite generation of ker(phi) locally. In particular, we need only check it on an open set U for which F itself is generated by finitely many sections over U. We can then add phi to a surjection O_X^m -&gt; F to get another surjection, and proceed from there.</p>

<p><strong>If A is a coherent ring, is the structure <a id="sheaf" name="sheaf"></a>sheaf on Spec A necessarily coherent?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. This follows from the fact that if A is a coherent ring, then so is the localization A_f for any f in A. That can be checked directly from my definition, or it can be deduced by establishing an alternate criterion: a ring is coherent if and only if any finitely generated ideal is finitely presented.</p>

<p><strong>I'm confused about the Hilbert <a id="function" name="function"></a>function (PS 10, problem 11(b)).</strong></p>
<p>That's because I was confused about it too. The classical definition is not the one I gave: if X is a closed subscheme of P^r_k = Proj S for S = k[x_0, ..., x_n], and I is the saturated ideal defining S, then the Hilbert function is n -&gt; dim_k (S/I)_n. For n large, this agrees with the Hilbert polynomial and hence with the number I wrote down, but not for small n; e.g., if X is zero-dimensional, then my Hilbert function is constant but the classical one is not.</p>
