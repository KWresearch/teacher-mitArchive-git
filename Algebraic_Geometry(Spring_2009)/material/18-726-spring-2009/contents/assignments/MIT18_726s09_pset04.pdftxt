18.726:  Algebraic  Geometry  (K.S.  Kedlaya,  MIT,  Spring  2009) 
Problem  Set  4  (due  Friday,  March  6,  in  class) 

Please  submit  exactly  twelve  of  the  following  exercises,  including  all  exercises  marked 
“Required”. 

1.  Eisenbud-Harris  II-11  and  II-20.	 (If  you  need  more  examples,  I  recommend  some  of 
the  other  exercises  in  Eisenbud-Harris,  chapter  II.) 

2.  Here  is  a  slightly  stronger  version  of  the  third  fundamental  theorem  of  aﬃne  schemes. 
Let A be a ring and let V  be a quasicompact open subset  of Spec(A).  Prove  that every 
quasicoherent  sheaf on OSpec(A) |V  has  the  form M˜ |V  for some A-module M .  (If you get 
stuck,  see  EGA  1,  Th´eor`eme  1.4.1.) 

3.	

(a)  Prove  that  a morphism  f  : Y  � X  is  aﬃne  if  and  only  if  it  occurs  as  the  relative 
Spec  of  a  quasicoherent  sheaf  of OX -modules. 
(b)  Prove  that  a morphism  f  : Y  � X  is  ﬁnite  if  and  only  if  it  occurs  as  the  relative 
Spec  of  a  quasicoherent  sheaf  of OX -modules  which  is  locally  ﬁnite  over  OX . 
(Hint  for  both:  view  f�OY  as  an  OX -module  via  f � .) 

4.  (Required)  Hartshorne  II.4.1. 

5.  Hartshorne  II.4.2. 

6.  (Required)  Hartshorne  II.4.3. 

7.  Hartshorne  II.4.6. 

8.  (Required)  Hartshorne  II.4.8.  (For  the  record,  this  is  EGA  Remarque  1.5.5.12.) 

9.  (Not  required,  but  strongly  recommended)  Let	 f  :  X  �  Y  be  a  continuous  map  of 
topological  spaces.  We  say  f  is  closed  if  the  image  of  every  closed  subset  of  X  is  a 
closed  subset  of Y .  We  say  that f  is  proper  if  for any  topological  space Z ,  the  induced 
map  f  × idZ  : X × Z  � Y  × Z  is  closed. 

(a)  Show  that  if	 f  is  injective,  closed  implies  proper.  Then  exhibit  an  example  to 
illustrate  that  closed  may  not  imply  proper  in  general. 
(b)  Show  that  properness  is  local  on  the  target,  i.e.,  if  {Ui}  is  a  cover  of  Y  by  open 
subsets,  and  f −1 (Ui ) � Ui  is  proper  for  each  i,  then  f  is  proper. 
(c)  Show  that  f  is  proper  if  and  only  if  f  is  closed  and  for  each  y  �  Y ,  f −1 (y )  is 
quasicompact. 
(d)  Suppose  X  is  Hausdorﬀ  and  Y  is  locally  compact.  Show  that  f  is  proper  if  and 
only  if  for  every  compact  subset  K  of  Y ,  f −1 (K )  is  compact. 

(For more  along  these  lines,  see  Bourbaki,  Topologie  Generale,  §1.6.)

11. (Required) Show that each of the following properties of morphisms satisﬁes the axioms 
of the strong collater, when deﬁned in the na¨ıve way over an aﬃne base. 

(a)  Locally  of  ﬁnite  type. 
(b)  Locally  of  ﬁnite  presentation.

is quasicompact (every open cover has a ﬁnite subcover).  Show that this 
of
notion satisies the axioms of the strong collater, so that we obtain a notion of 
quasicompactness of morphisms which is local on the base and stable under base 
change.  (This  is  essentially  Hartshorne  II.3.2.) 
(b) Prove that any morphism which is aﬃne is quasicompact. 
(c) Prove that a morphism is of ﬁnite type if and only if it is locally of ﬁnite type 
and quasicompact. (This is Hartshorne II.3.3(a). The other parts of that exercise 
should  be  obvious  by  now.) 

13. Prove that a composition of morphisms of ﬁnite presentation is again of ﬁnite presen-
tation. This is tricky because a closed immersion need not be of ﬁnite presentation 
(unless  the  target  is  locally  noetherian).

stable  under  base  change. 

15. Prove that the category of abstract algebraic varieties over the algebraically closed ﬁeld 
is equivalent to the category of schemes which are reduced and locally of ﬁnite type

over Spec( ). (Hint: most of this proof is written out in Hartshorne.)
