18.726:  Algebraic  Geometry  (K.S.  Kedlaya,  MIT,  Spring  2009) 
Problem  Set  10  (due  Friday,  April  24,  in  class) 

Please  submit  nine  of  the following  exercises (counting  with  multiplicities  as indicated), 
including  all  items  marked  “Required”.  More  exercises  than  usual  this  week  are  from 
Eisenbud-Harris;  let  me  know  if  you  need  access  to  a  copy. 

1.  Recall  that  a  paracompact  topological  space  is  a  Hausdorﬀ  space  on  which  every  open 
covering  admits  a  locally  ﬁnite  reﬁnement.  Prove  that  if  X  is  paracompact,  then  for 
every  locally  ﬁnite  open  covering  U =  {Ui}i∈I  of  X ,  there  exists  another  open  covering 
V =  {Vi}i∈I  of  X  with  the  same  index  set,  such  that  for  each  i  ∈  I ,  the  closure  of  Vi 
in  X  is  contained  in  Ui .  (I  include  this  mostly so  that  you  may  assume  it  for  the  next 
exercise.  See  Bourbaki’s  Topologie  generale.) 

2.  Let  X  be  a  paracompact  topological  space. 

(a)  Let  U,  V  be  as  in  the  previous  exercise.  Let  F  → G  be  a  surjective  morphism 
of  sheaves  of  abelian  groups  on  X .  Prove  that  for  any  open  subset  T  of  X ,  any 
element  s  ∈  Γ(Cˇ i (U, G ), T ) lifts  to  Γ(Cˇ i (W, F ), T ) for  some  reﬁnement  W  of  U. 
(Hint:  for  each x ∈  X ,  one  can  ﬁnd  an  open  neighborhood  Wx  of  x meeting  only 
ﬁnitely  many  of  the  Ui .  Show  that  you  can  choose  Wx  so  that  x  ∈  Ui  implies 
Wx  ⊆  Ui ,  x ∈  Vi  implies  Wx  ⊆  Vi ,  Wx  ∩ Vi 
6=  ∅  implies  x ∈  Ui ,  and  x ∈  T  implies 
s  lifts to  Wx .) 

(b)  Use  this  to  show  that  the  functors 

F 

7→  lim Cˇ ·  (U, F )
−→ 
U 

are  exact,  and  so  conclude  that  ˇCech  cohomology  and  sheaf  cohomology  coincide 
on  a  paracompact  space.

5.  (Counts  as  two) Hartshorne  III.5.8. 

6.  (Required) Hartshorne III.5.10. 

7.  (Counts as two) In this exercise,  we classify vector bundles on  P1 
k , for  k an algebraically 
closed  ﬁeld;  this  is  due  to  Grothendieck,  based  on  ideas  of  Serre.  Throughout,  let  F 
denote a  ﬁnitely generated locally free quasicoherent  sheaf  on  P1 
k ; let d denote the rank 
of  F ,  and  deﬁne  the  degree  of  F  as  the  unique  integer  n  such that  ∧dF ∼=  O(n); this 
exists  and is  unique by  Corollary  II.6.17.  (Compare Hartshorne  exercise V.2.6 (sic).)

(a)  Suppose  that


0  → O(n1 ) → F  → O(n2 ) →  0


is  a  short  exact  sequence  of  quasicoherent  sheaves  and  that  n1  < n2 .  Prove  that 
there  exists  a  rank  1  subbundle  of  F  of degree  > n1 .  (Hint:  twist  to  reduce  to 
the  case  n1  =  −1,  then  take  cohomology.) 
(b)  Suppose  that


0  → O(n1 ) → F  → O(n2 ) →  0


is  a  short  exact  sequence  of  quasicoherent  sheaves  and  that  n1  ≥  n2 .  Prove  that 
the  exact  sequence  splits.  (Hint:  twist  to  reduce  to  the  case  n2  =  0,  then  take 
cohomology  again.) 

(c)  Prove  that  F  contains  a  subsheaf  isomorphic  to  O(n) for  some  n; deduce that  F 
admits  a  “composition  series” 

0 =  F0  ⊂ F1  ⊂  · · ·  ⊂ Fd  =  F 

by  subsheaves  with  Fi/Fi−1  locally  free  of  rank  1  for  i = 1, . . . , d.  (Hint:  if F  is 
nonzero,  then  it  admits  a  rational  section.) 

(d)  Prove  that  the  set  of  degrees  of  rank  1  subsheaves  of  F  is  bounded  above.  (Hint: 
compare to a  ﬁltration as in (c).) 

(e)  Prove  that  F  admits  a  composition  series  with 

deg(F1/F0) ≥  deg(F2/F1) ≥  · · ·  ≥  deg(Fd/Fd−1). 

(Hint:  take F1  to  be  a  subsheaf  of  F  with  degree  as  large  as  possible.) 
(f )  Prove  that  F ∼ ⊕i
d 
=1O(ni ) for  some  integers  n1 , . . . , nd .

8.  (Required) Let  X  be  a  nonempty  closed  subscheme  of  Pr
k , for  k  an  algebraically  closed 
ﬁeld.  Prove  that  for  a  generic  hyperplane  H ,  we  have  dim(X ∩ H ) < dim(X ); that is, 
the hyperplanes  H  for which  this fails correspond  to the points of  a closed  subscheme of 
the  Grassmannian.  (This  Grassmannian  is  itself a  pro jective  space,  in  the  coeﬃcients 
describing  H  in  terms  of  x0 , . . . , xn .) 

9.  (Eisenbud-Harris III-58) Let  A  be  a  noetherian  ring.  Let  X  be  a  closed  subscheme  of 
Pr  for  some  r ≥  1.  Prove  that  for  any  nonnegative  integer  n, the function 
A 

t  7→  dimκ(t) Γ(Xt , O(n)) 

is  upper  semicontinuous;  that  is,  for  each  m ∈  Z,  the  set  of  points  where  the  function 
has  value  at  least  m  is  closed  in  Spec A. 

10.  Eisenbud-Harris  III-60. 

11.  (Required) The  Hilbert  function  of  a  closed  subscheme  X  of  a  pro jective  space  over  a 
ﬁeld  k  is  the  function  on  nonnegative  integers  deﬁned  by  n  7→  dimk  H 0(X, O(n)).

(a)  Find  the  Hilbert  polynomial  and  the  Hilbert  function  of  all  subschemes  of  the 
plane  of  length  3  over  an  algebraically  closed  ﬁeld. 

(b)  Give  an  example  of  two  schemes  with  the  same  Hilbert  polynomial  but  not  the 
same Hilbert function.

13.  Check  the  numerical  criterion  for  ﬂatness  explicitly  for  Hartshorne  Example  III.9.8.4.
