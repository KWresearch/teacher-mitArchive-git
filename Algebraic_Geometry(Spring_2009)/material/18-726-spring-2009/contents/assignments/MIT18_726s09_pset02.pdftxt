18.726:  Algebraic  Geometry  (K.S.  Kedlaya,  MIT,  Spring  2009) 
Problem  Set  2  (due  Friday,  February  20,  in  class) 

Please  submit  exactly  twelve  of  the  following  exercises,  including  all  exercises  marked 
“Required”. 

1.  (Required) Prove  that  Set  and  its  opposite  category  are  not  equivalent,  by  ﬁnding  an 
arrow-theoretic property  satisﬁed by  Set  but  not by  its  opposite,  or  vice  versa.  (Many 
solutions  are  possible.) 

2.  Prove  that  the  sheaﬁﬁcation  functor  from  presheaves  on  a  topological  space  X  to 
sheaves  on  X ,  and  the  forgetful  functor  from  sheaves  to  presheaves,  form  an  adjoint 
pair. 

3.  (Required) 

(a)  Complete the proof  of  the basis lemma (“sheaves”  handout)  in the  case  of  a  nice 
basis. 

(b)  Complete  the  proof  of  the  basis  lemma  in  general. 

4. 

X→֒Z:iLet
be an inclusion of topological
topology.  Let  F  be  a  sheaf  on  X . 

spaces in which

Z

carries the subspace

(a)  If  Z  is  open,  prove  that  i−1F  may  be  canonically  identiﬁed  with  the  restriction 
F |Z . 
(b)  If  Z  =  {x}, prove that  i−1F  may  be  canonically  identiﬁed  with  the  stalk  Fx . 

5.  (Required  if  you’ve  never  done  it  before)  Prove  the  ﬁve  lemma  (“abelian  sheaves” 
handout). 

6.  (Required  if  you’ve  never  done  it  before) 

(a)  Complete the proof  of  the  snake lemma (“abelian  sheaves”  handout). 

(b)  Let

be  a  commutative  diagram  in  which  the  rows  are  exact  and  the  columns  are 
complexes.  Use  the  snake  lemma  to  show  that 

ker(f1) 
im(f0 )

ker(g1) 
im(g0)

ker(h1 ) 
im(h0 )

ker(h2 ) 
im(h1 ) 

is exact, where  δ  is deﬁned  as in the snake lemma, and  the other maps are induced 
naturally by  the horizontal  arrows.  (This will later give us the long exact sequence 
in  homology.) 

7.	

(a)  Let  f ∗  :  C1  → C2  and  f∗  :  C2  → C2  be  an  adjoint pair  of functors,  where  C1  and  C2 
are  abelian  categories.  Prove  that  f ∗  is  right  exact  and  f∗  is  left  exact. 

(b)  Use  this  to  prove  that  as  functors  from  ModR  to  itself  (for  any  given  ring  R), 
Hom(X, ·) is  left  exact  and  X  ⊗R  ·  is  right  exact.  (I.e.,  prove  that  these  two  form 
an  adjoint  pair.) 

8.  The  Taylor  series  map  gives  a  ring  homomorphism  from  the  germs  at  0  of  the  sheaf 
of  holomorphic  functions  on  Cn  to  C�x1 , . . . , xn �.  Prove  that  this  map  is  injective, 
and  that  its  image  consists  of  the  power  series  which  converge  on  some  open  polydisc 
around 0. 

9.  Do  Hartshorne  II.1.3,  but  for  (b),  instead  of  the  example  given  in  class,  make  an 
example  on  the  space  {1,  2,  3} with  topology generated by  {1,  2},  {2,  3}. 

10.  (Required) 

(a)  Prove Hartshorne II.1.7 by  checking  that formation of kernel, image, and  cokernel 
of  a  morphism  of  abelian  sheaves  commute  with  passage  to  stalks. 

(b)  Prove  that  abelian  sheaves  on  a  ﬁxed  topological  space  form  an  abelian  category 
in  which  the  categorical  kernel,  image,  and  cokernel  coincide  with  the  notions  we 
deﬁned. 

11.  Prove that a preadditive category  with  ﬁnite products is additive, that is, the product 
can  be  naturally  equipped  with  a  biproduct  structure. 

12.  A  topological  space  is  quasicompact  if  every  open  cover  admits  a  ﬁnite  subcover.  (The 
term  compact  is  usually  reserved for  a  space  which is  not just quasicompact but  also 
Hausdorﬀ.) 

(a)  Recall  that for any  ring  R, Spec(R) is quasicompact.  (We did this in class,  so you 
don’t  have  to  write  anything  here.) 
(b)  Prove  that  if  R  is  a  noetherian  ring,  then  any  subset  of  Spec(R) is quasicompact. 

(c)  Prove  that (b)  can fail if  R  is  not  noetherian.  (Hint:  construct  a  ring  in  which 
Spec(R) contains  an  inﬁnite  subset  carrying  the  discrete  topology.)

13.  (Required) Describe Spec Z  by  listing: 

(a)  the  points; 

(b)  the  open  sets; 

(c)  the  sections  of  the  structure  sheaf  over  each  open  set. 

14.	

(a)  What is the maximum number of  elements of  Z which do not have the same value 
at  any  point  of  Spec(Z)? 
(b)  Same  question  with  Z  replaced  by  the  ring  Z[i] of  Gaussian  integers? 

15.  (Required) Hartshorne II.2.1  and II.2.2 (these  count  as  one  exercise). 

16.  This exercise is an arithmetic analogue of  the fact that the complement  of  the origin in 
A2  is  not  an  aﬃne  algebraic  variety.  Let  X  be  the  locally  ringed  space  obtained  from 
Spec Z[x] by  removing  the point (2, x). 

(a)  Prove  that  Γ(X, OX ) =  Z[x].  (Hint:  cover X  with  the  distinguished  opens  D(2) 
and  D(x) of  Spec Z[x].) 

(b)  Use (a)  to  show that  X  is  not  aﬃne. 

17.  Hartshorne  II.2.10  or  Hartshorne II.2.11 (but  not both).
