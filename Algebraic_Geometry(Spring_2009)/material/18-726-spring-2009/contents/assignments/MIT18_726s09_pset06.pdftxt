18.726:  Algebraic  Geometry  (K.S.  Kedlaya,  MIT,  Spring  2009) 
Problem  Set  6  (due  Friday,  March  20,  in  class) 

Please  submit  exactly  eleven  of  the  following  exercises,  including  all  exercises  marked 
“Required”.  Note  that  the  Hartshorne  exercises  are  now  coming  from  both  chapters  II  and 
III;  read  closely! 

1.  Eisenbud-Harris  II-25  and  II-26. 

2.  Eisenbud-Harris  II-31. 

3.  (Required)  Let	 A  �  B  be  a  homomorphism  of  rings.  Prove  that  B  is  faithfully  ﬂat 
over A  in  the  sense  of  commutative  algebra  (i.e.,  for  any  A-module M ,  the  adjunction 
map  M  �  M  �A  B  of  A-modules  is  injective)  if  and  only  if  A  �  B  is  ﬂat  and 
Spec(B )  �  Spec(A)  is  surjective  (i.e.,  the  morphism  is  faithfully  ﬂat  in  the  sense  of 
schemes). 

4.  (Required)  Prove  faithful  ﬂat  descent  for  quasicoherent  sheaves,  as  follows. 

(a)  Let	 f  :  A  �  B  be  a  faithfully  ﬂat  ring  homomorphism.  Prove  descent  for  the 
morphism  Spec(B  �A  B )  �  Spec B  induced  by  f  �  idB ,  as  follows.  Let  µ  : 
B  �A  B  �  B  denote  the  multiplication  map.  Given  a  (B  �A  B )-module  M 
equipped  with  a  descent  datum,  recover  the  underlying  B -module  by  forming 
M  �µ  B . 
(b)  Prove  descent  for  any  morphism  between  aﬃne  schemes,  as  follows.	 Let  M  be  a 
B -module  M  equipped  with  a  descent  datum.  Let  �1 , �2  :  B  �  B �A  B  be  the 
two  embeddings.  Let  �  :  M  ��1  (B �A  B )  �  M  ��2  (B �A  B )  be  the  descent 
isomorphism.  Construct the A-submodule N  of M  consisting of those n  for which 
� (m � 1) = m � 1.  Show  that  the map N  �A  B � M  is  an  isomorphism.  (Hint: 
since  A  �  B  is  faithfully  ﬂat,  we  may  replace  A  and  B  by  B  and  B  �A  B , 
respectively.  Then  use  (a).) 
(c)  Prove  descent  for  any morphism  of  schemes,  by  reducing  to  the  aﬃne  case. 

5.  Deduce  Galois  descent  from  faithful  ﬂat  descent  for  quasicoherent  sheaves,  without 
using  Theorem  90. 

6.  Prove  that  the  following  properties  of  a  morphism  of  schemes  can  be  checked  after  a 
faithfully  ﬂat  quasicompact  base  change. 

(a)  Universally  closed. 
(b)  Separated. 
(c)  Proper. 

7.  A  morphism  is	 quasiﬁnite  if  it  is  of  ﬁnite  type  and  has  ﬁnite  ﬁbres  (i.e.,  the  inverse 
image  of  each  point  consists  of  ﬁnitely  many  points.)

(a)  Prove  that  the  property  of  being  quasiﬁnite  is  stable  under  base  change. 
(b)  Prove  that  a morphism  is  ﬁnite  if  and  only  if  it  is  proper  and  quasiﬁnite. 
(c)  Prove	 that  the  properties  of  being  quasiﬁnite  or  ﬁnite  can  be  checked  after  a 
faithfully  ﬂat  quasicompact  base  change.  (You  may  use  the  previous  exercise 
whether  or  not  you  submit  it.) 

8.  Let  f  :  X  �  S  be  a  morphism  of  schemes,  and  put  �i  =  → i  �X/S  (the  exterior 
X/S 
OX 
product).  Show  that  for  each  i �  0,  there  is  a  unique  f −1 (OS )-linear  homomorphism 
d : �i  � �i+1  satisfying
X/S 
X/S 

d(g dh1  → · · · → dhi ) = dg → dh1  → · · · → dhi 

for  any  open  aﬃne  U  ≥  X  and  any  g , h1 , . . . , hi  ⊗ O(U ).  (The  hard  part  is  well­
deﬁnedness.)  Show  moreover  that 

d

d
0 � OX  � �1  � �2  � · · · 
X/S 
X/S 

is  a  complex  of  f −1 (OS )-modules  (the  terms  are  actually  OX -modules  but  the  maps 
are  not  OX -linear).  This  complex  is  called  the  de  Rham  complex  of X  relative  to  S . 

9.  Here  is  a  simple  example  of  computing  the  cohomology  of  a  de  Rham  complex.	 Let 
k  be  a  ﬁeld  of  characteristic  zero.  Let  P (x)  be  a  polynomial  with  no  repeated  roots, 
and  put  A = k [x, y ]/(y 2  − P (x)).  Show  that  the  cokernel  of  the  map  d  : A � �A/k  is 
ﬁnite-dimensional, and exhibit a basis.  (You may wish to separate into cases depending 
on  the  parity  of  deg(P ).) 

10.  Hartshorne  II.8.5. 

11.  (Recommended)  Hartshorne  II.8.6. 

12.  Hartshorne  II.8.8. 

13.  Prove  directly  (i.e.,  without  using  the  characterization  of  smoothness  in  terms  of  ﬂat­
ness  and  regularity)  that  the morphism  Pn 
Z  � Spec Z  is  formally  smooth. 

14.  Hartshorne  III.9.2. 

15.  (Required)  Hartshorne  III.9.3. 

16.  Hartshorne  III.10.1. 

17.  (Required)  Hartshorne  III.10.6.
