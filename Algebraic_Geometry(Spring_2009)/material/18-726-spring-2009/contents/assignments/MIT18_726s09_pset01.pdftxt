18.726:  Algebraic  Geometry  (K.S.  Kedlaya,  MIT,  Spring  2009) 
Problem  Set  1  (due  Friday,  February  13,  in  class) 

Since  I  didn’t  do  so  earlier,  let  me  take  space  here  to  enunciate  the  collaboration  policy 
for  this  class.  You  may  and  should  collaborate  freely  with  others  in  the  class  in  attempting 
to  solve  the  problem  sets.  You  may  also  consult  outside  references  (textbooks,  web  sites, 
people  not  in  the  class,  etc.).  However,  you  must: 

•	 write  up  your  solutions  independently; 

•	 acknowledge all  collaborators and  outside references (a single list for the whole problem 
set  will  suﬃce).  Exception:  you  need  not  acknowledge  anything  on  the  course  web  site 
(class  notes,  virtual oﬃce  hours,  etc.),  Hartshorne’s  book,  or  me.  (Also,  you  may not 
cite  a  statement  in  EGA  which  immediately  implies  the  statement  of  a  problem.) 

Okay,  back  to  work.  Please  submit  exactly  eleven  of  the  following  exercises,  including 
all  exercises marked  “Required”.  (If you work in a group, you are encouraged not to submit 
the  same  subset  of  problems!) 

1.	 (Required) Prove  Yoneda’s  lemma  as  stated  in  lecture. 

2.  (Required)  Describe  a  left  adjoint  of  the  forgetful  functor  on  each  of  the  following 
categories.  (You don’t  need to justify your  answers.) 

(a)  Vector  spaces  over  a  ﬁeld  K . 

(b)  Rings. 

(c)  Topological  spaces. 

3.  (Required)  A  preadditive  category  is  a  category  in  which  each  homset  Hom(X, Y ) is 
equipped  with  the  structure  of  an  abelian  group  in  a  functorial  way,  and  composition 
is distributive  over this group  structure.  For instance, there is  an  obvious  way  to  view 
Ab  as  an  additive  category. 

(a)  Reformulate  this  deﬁnition  rigorously  using  a  natural  transformation. 
(b)  Deﬁne  a  kernel  and  cokernel  of  a  morphism  X  →  Y  in  a  preadditive  category. 
(Hint:  each  of  these  consists  of  an  object  plus  a  morphism  satisfying  a  certain 
universal property.) 

(c)  Show  that  for  any  ﬁeld  K ,  if  we  take  the  category  of  ﬁnitely  generated  modules 
over  K [x],  and  the  full  subcategory  of  ﬁnite  free  modules  over  K [x],  then  both 
categories admit  cokernels, but the image of  a cokernel  under the inclusion functor 
may  not  be  a  cokernel. 

(d)  You might think  that if  a category  admits a faithful functor to Ab, then this gives 
it  the  structure  of  a  preadditive  category.  Give  a  familiar  example  where  this 
fails.

We  will  use  this  exercise  later  to  deﬁne  the  concept  of  an  abelian  category. 

4.  (Required) Here  is  a  variant  on  the  product  which  we  will  be  using  extensively  later. 
Given  two  morphisms  Y  →  X  and  Z  →  X  in  a  category,  a  ﬁbre product  of these two 
morphisms  is  a  limit  of  the  diagram

We  usually  denote  a  ﬁbre  product  by  Y  ×X  Z .


(a)  Show that  ﬁbre products exist in the category of  sets, and describe them explicitly. 
(b)  Prove  that  X  →  Y  is  a  monomorphism  if  and  only  if  the  induced  map  X  → 
X ×Y  X  is  an  isomorphism. 
(c)  Suppose  X  →  Y  is  a  monomorphism,  and  let  W  →  X  and  Z  →  X  be  two  other 
morphisms.  Show  that  W  ×X  Z  and  W  ×Y  Z  are  canonically  isomorphic. 

5.	

(a)  Prove  that  inverse  limits  exist  in  the  category  of  topological  spaces.  (Hint:  the 
underlying  set  of  the inverse limit is the same as the inverse limit  of the underlying 
sets.  Figure  out  what  the  right  topology  should  be.) 

(b)  Prove  that  an  inverse  limit  of  compact  topological  spaces  is  compact.  You  may 
use without proof  Tikhonov’s theorem :  any product  of  compact topological  spaces 
is  again  compact. 

6.  (Required) Hartshorne II.1.2. 

7.  Hartshorne  II.1.4. 

8.  (Required) Hartshorne II.1.8. 

9.  Hartshorne II.1.10  and II.1.12 (they  count together  as  one problem). 

10.  Hartshorne  II.1.11. 

11.  Hartshorne  II.1.13. 

12.  Hartshorne  II.1.14. 

13.  Hartshorne  II.1.16. 

14.  Hartshorne  II.1.17. 

15.  (Required) Hartshorne II.1.18. 

16.  Hartshorne  II.1.19.
