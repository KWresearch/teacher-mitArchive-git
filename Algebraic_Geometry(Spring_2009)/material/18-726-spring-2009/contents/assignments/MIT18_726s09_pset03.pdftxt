18.726:  Algebraic  Geometry  (K.S.  Kedlaya,  MIT,  Spring  2009) 
Problem  Set  3  (due  Friday,  February  27,  in  class) 

Please  submit  exactly  thirteen  of  the  following  exercises,  including  all  exercises  marked 
“Required”. 

1.  (Required) Use  the  fact  that  the  structure  sheaf  on  Spec(R) is  a  sheaf  to  recover  the 
Chinese  remainder  theorem  in  R. 

2.  Let  S  be  any  set.  Prove  that  X  = Spec FS 
2  (the  product  of  copies  of  F2  indexed by 
S )  can  be  equipped  with  a  map  f  :  S  →  X  such  that  for  any  function  g  :  S  →  Y 
with  Y  a  compact  topological  space,  there  exists  a  unique  continuous  map  h  :  X  →  Y 
In  other  words,  X  is the  Stone- ˇ
with  g  = 
h ◦  f . 
Cech  compactiﬁcation  of the discrete 
topological  space  on  S . 

3.  (for  those  who  know  about  elliptic  curves)  Let  k  be  an  algebraically  closed  ﬁeld.  Let 
E  be  an  elliptic  curve  over  k .  Let  P , Q ∈  E (k) be  two  points  such  that  the  diﬀerence 
P  − Q  is  not  a  torsion  point  under  the  group  law  on  E (k).  Prove  that  E  \ {P , Q} is 
an  open  subscheme  of  E  which  is  aﬃne  but  not  distinguished. 

4.  Hartshorne  II.2.3. 

5.  (Required) Read  the  discussion  of  graded  rings  and  Pro j,  then  do  the  following.

A

deﬁnition  of  it  as  Pro j A[x0 , . . . , xn ].


(b)  Do parts (a)-(c)  of Hartshorne II.2.14.

8.  Hartshorne  II.2.15. 

9.  (Required) Hartshorne II.2.16  and II.2.17 (these  count  as  one  exercise).

12.  Verify  that  for  Y  →  X  and  Z  →  X  morphisms  of  schemes,  the  ﬁbre  product  Y  ×X  Z 
in  the  category  of  schemes  is  also  a  ﬁbre  product  in  the  category  of  locally  ringed 
spaces.  (Hint: 
imitate  the  construction  of  the  ﬁbre  product,  starting  with  the  case 
where  X, Y , Z  are  all  aﬃne.) 

13.  Which  of  these  properties  of  a  morphism  of  schemes  is  stable  under  arbitrary  base 
change? 

(a)  injectivity (on points) 

(b)  surjectivity (on points) 

(c)  bijectivity (on points) 

14.  (Required) Hartshorne II.3.9. 

15.  Hartshorne  II.3.10. 

16.  (Required) Here  is  a  device  we  will  use  over  and  over  again  to  construct  properties  of 
morphisms  of  schemes.  (I’ll need  a  name  for  this;  call  it  the  weak  col later.)  Let  P  be a 
property  of  morphisms  of  schemes  f  :  Y  →  X  which  is  only  deﬁned  when  X  is  aﬃne. 
Suppose  that  the  following  condition  holds. 

(i)  Let  f  :  Y  →  X  be  a  morphism  with  X  aﬃne.  Let  D(g1), . . . , D(gn)  be  a  ﬁnite 
covering  of  X  by  distinguished  open  subsets.  Then  f  has property  P  if  and  only 
if  the  induced  morphisms  Y  ×X  D(gi) →  D(gi ) all  have  property  P . 

Prove that for  f  :  Y  →  X  an  arbitrary  morphism,  the  following  are  equivalent. 

(a)  For  a  single  open aﬃne cover  {Ui}i∈I  of  X , each induced  morphism  Y  ×X Ui  →  Ui 
has property  P . 
(b)  For each  open aﬃne cover  {Ui}i∈I  of  X , each induced  morphism  Y ×X Ui  →  Ui  has 
property  P .  (In  other  words,  for  every open  aﬃne  U  ⊆  X ,  the  induced  morphism 
Y  ×X  U  →  U  has property  P .) 

(If these  hold,  we  say  that  f  also has property  P .  A  property  constructed  this  way  is 
automatically  local  on  the  target.) 

17.  (Required)  Add  the  following  hypothesis  to  the  previous  exercise.  (I’ll  call  this  the 
strong  col later.) 

(ii)  Let  f  :  Y  →  X  be  a  morphism  with  X  aﬃne, having property  P .  Then  for  any 
morphism  g  :  Z  →  X  with  Z  also  aﬃne,  f  ×  g  :  Y  ×X  Z  →  Z  has property  P . 

Then deduce that (a)  and (b)  in the previous  exercise  are  equivalent to this  condition. 

2 

(c)  For  every  morphism  g  :  Z  →  X  with  Z  aﬃne,  f  ×  g  :  Y  ×X  Z  →  Z  has property 
P . 

Then prove  also that property  P  (for  an  arbitrary morphism)  is  stable  under  arbitrary 
base  change.  Almost  all  properties  of  morphisms  that  we  will  consider  are  both  local 
on  the  target  and  stable  under  base  change. 

18.  (Suggested by Kaloyan)  Give  an  alternate proof  of  the (ﬁrst)  fundamental  theorem  of 
aﬃne  schemes,  as  follows.  Let  R  be  a  ring  and  let  M  be  an  R-module. 

(a)  Put  M =  Γ(  ˜ , Spec(R)).  (I  leave  it  to  you  to  deﬁne  the  sheaﬁﬁcation  of  a 
′ 
M +
presheaf  speciﬁed  on  a  basis.)  Describe  the  natural  R-module  structure  on  M ′ 
and  the  natural  R-module homomorphism  M  →  M ′ . 

′  is  an  isomorphism. 
(b)  Show  that  for  each  prime  ideal  p,  the  induced  map  Mp →  Mp 
(c)  Deduce  that  M  →  M ′  is  an  isomorphism.  (Hint:  consider  the  annihilators  of the 
kernel  and  cokernel  of  the  map.) 

19.  Let  L/K  be a  ﬁeld  extension  of degree  d. Prove that Spec L ×Spec K  Spec L has at  most 
d  points,  with  equality  if  and  only  if  L  is  Galois  over  K . 

20.  (Required) Let  X  →  S  be  a  morphism  of  schemes.  We  say  X  is  a  group  scheme  over 
S  if for each  S -scheme  Y  →  S ,  the  set  XS (Y ) of  Y -valued points of  X  →  S  (i.e.,  maps 
Y  →  X  commuting  with  the  other two)  comes  equipped  with  a group  structure  which 
is functorial in  Y . 

(a)  Write  this  deﬁnition  in  terms  of  natural  transformations. 
(b)  Write  this  deﬁnition  directly  in  terms  of  X  →  S . 
(c)  Describe explicitly a group  scheme  Ga  over Spec Z such  that for any  ring  R,  Ga (R) 
is  the  additive  group  of  R. 
(d)  Describe  explicitly  a  group  scheme  Gm  over  Spec Z  such  that  for  any  ring  R, 
Gm (R) is  the  multiplicative  group  of  units  of  R.
