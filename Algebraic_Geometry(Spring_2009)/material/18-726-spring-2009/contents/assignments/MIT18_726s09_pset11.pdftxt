18.726:  Algebraic  Geometry  (K.S.  Kedlaya,  MIT,  Spring  2009) 
Problem  Set  11  (due  Friday,  May  1,  in  class) 

Please  submit  eight  of  the following  exercises (counting  with  multiplicities  as indicated), 
including  all  items  marked  “Required”. 

(This  depends  on  Hartshorne  III.2.3,  which  was  a  nonrequired 

1.  Hartshorne  III.2.4. 
problem previously.) 

2.  Hartshorne  III.4.6. 

3.  Hartshorne  III.9.8. 

4.  Hartshorne  III.9.9  (you  may  assume  the  previous  exercise  for  this  even  if  you  don’t 
turn it in). 

5.  (Required) 

(a)  I  gave  the  wrong  deﬁnition  of  coherent  sheaves  in  lecture.  The  correct  one  is  the 
following.  Let  F  be  a  sheaf  on  a  ringed  space  (X, OX ).  Then  F  is  coherent  if 
⊕n  → F ,  not  necessarily 
for  any  open  subset  U  of  X  and  any  morphism  φ  :  OU 
surjective,  the  kernel  of  φ  is  ﬁnitely  generated. 

(b)  Let  0  → F1  → F  → F2  →  0  be  an  exact  sequence  of  quasicoherent  sheaves  on 
X .  Prove  that  if  any  two  of  F ,  F1 ,  F2  are  coherent,  then  so  is  the  third. 

6.  Compute  the  ˇCech  cohomology  of  the  twisting  sheaves  O(n) on the analytic pro jective 
space  P˜
r  using  the  usual  cover  by  r  + 1  aﬃne  spaces.

7.  (Required) In Serre’s  ﬁniteness theorem, suppose that we don’t  assume that the ring  A 
is  noetherian,  but  we  do  assume  that  A[x1 , . . . , xn ] is  coherent  as  a  module  over  itself 
for  each  nonnegative  integer  n,  and  the  sheaf  F  is  coherent.  Prove  that  the  conclusion 
of Serre’s theorem still holds.  (Hint: prove that the H i (X, F ) are coherent  A-modules.) 

8.  (Counts  as  two)  Let  X  be  a  proper  scheme  over  C,  with  analytiﬁcation  h  :  X˜ →  X . 
Using  Chow’s  lemma  to  reduce  to  the  pro jective  case,  show  that  GAGA  still  applies 
to  X  in  the  following  senses. 

(a)  Any  coherent  sheaf  on  X˜ is  the  pullback  of  a  unique  coherent  sheaf  on  X . 
(b)  If  F ,  G  are  coherent  sheaves  on  X ,  then  any  morphism  h∗F →  h∗G  of  coherent 
sheaves  on  X˜ is  the  pullback  of  a  unique  morphism  F  → G  of  coherent  sheaves 
on  X . 

(c)  For  any  coherent  sheaf  F  on  X ,  there  are  natural  isomorphisms  H i (X, F )  → 
H i (X, G ) for  all  i  ≥  0.

(a)  Formulate  an  analogue  of  Grothendieck’s  analytiﬁcation  theorem,  giving  a  “vari­
etiﬁcation”  functor  from  reduced  separated  schemes  of  ﬁnite  type  over  an  alge­
braically  closed  ﬁeld  k  to  abstract  algebraic  varieties  over  k .

(b)  Check  the  assertion  of (a)  explicitly  for  A
k
of  the proof  of  the theorem you  stated in (a), but you don’t have to turn it in.) 

10.  Let  j  :  X  →  Pr  be  an  immersion.  Prove  that  the  following  are  equivalent. 
C 

(a)  X an  is  compact. 

(b)  j  is  a  closed  immersion. 
(c)  X  →  Spec C  is proper. 

11.  Read the handout on spectral  sequences, then verify that the construction of the derived 
exact  couple  does  indeed  give  an  exact  couple. 

12.  Read  the  handout  on  spectral  sequences,  then  write  out  explicitly  what  the  eﬀect  of 
p,q .  You  don’t  have  to  check  that  your  recipe  is  well-deﬁned, 
the diﬀerential  dr  is  on  Er
as long  as you indicate how your  answer  agrees with  the general  construction (which is 
already  well-deﬁned  given  the  previous  exercise).  You  might  want  to  check  Bott  and 
Tu,  but  I’d  beware  of  the  signs  if  I  were  you.
