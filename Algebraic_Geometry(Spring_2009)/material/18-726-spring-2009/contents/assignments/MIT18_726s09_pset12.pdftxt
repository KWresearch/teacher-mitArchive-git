18.726:  Algebraic  Geometry  (K.S.  Kedlaya,  MIT,  Spring  2009)

Problem  Set  12  (due  Friday,  May  8,  in  class)


Please  submit  eight  of  the  following  exercises,  including  all  items  marked  “Required”. 

1.  Do  PS  8,  problem  9  if  you  didn’t  submit  it  then.	 (A  related  problem  is  Hartshorne 
III.6.1.) 

2.  Hartshorne  III.6.2. 

3.  Hartshorne  III.6.3. 

4.  Hartshorne  III.6.6. 

5.  Hartshorne  III.7.2(a). 

6.  Hartshorne  III.8.1 and III.8.2.  (You may use  spectral sequences  on III.8.1 if you wish.) 

7.  (Required)  Let  A  be  a  ring,  and  put  X  =  Pn  for  some  n  ∩  1.  For  each  integer 
A 
p � {0, . . . , n}  and  each  q  � Z,  prove  that  H q (X, �p 
)  is  a  ﬁnite  free  A-module,  and 
X/A
compute  its  rank.  (Hint:  see  Hartshorne  III.7.3  for  part  of  the  answer.  Bigger  hint: 
∈
remember  that  �X/A  = OX (−n − 1).) 

8.  Let  C1 , C2  be  abelian  categories  such  that  C1  has  enough  injectives.  Let  F  :  C1  ⊕ C2 
be  a  left  exact  additive  functor.  For  C ·  a  cohomologically  graded  complex  in  nonneg­
ative  degrees,  we  deﬁne  the  right  derived  functors  R iF (C ·)  by  constructing  a  quasi­
isomorphism  C ⊕  I to  a  complex  of  injectives  and  putting  RiF (C ·) =  hi (F (I ·)). 
·
·
Prove  that  this  is  well-deﬁned  and  functorial.  (Hint:  the  existence  of  C ·  ⊕  I ·  was  a 
previous  exercise.  Using  a  pushout  construction,  you  can  reduce  well-deﬁnedness  to 
comparing  the  results  of using  two  injective  complexes  using  a map  I ·  ⊕ J · .  Similarly 
for  functoriality.) 

9.  For  F  =  �  :  ShAb (X )  ⊕  Ab  the  global  sections  functor,  the  derived  functors  in  the 
previous  exercise  are  called  the  hypercohomology  of  a  complex  of  sheaves  F · ,  denoted 
Hi (X, F ·).  Prove  that,  for  any  cover  U  which  is  good  for  each  of  the  F  ,  Hi (X, F ·) 
·
is  isomorphic  to  the  i-th  cohomology  of  the  total  complex  associated  to  the  double 
complex Cˇ (U, F ·).  For instance,  if F consists of 0 ⊕ F 0  ⊕ F 1  ⊕ 0 and U = {U1 , U2}, 
·	
·
then  Hi (X, F ·)  is  the  cohomology  of  the  complex 

0 ⊕ F 0 (U1 ) � F 0 (U2 ) ⊕ F 0 (U1  � U2 ) � F 1 (U1 ) � F 1 (U2 ) ⊕ F 1(U1  � U2 ) ⊕ 0 

in  which  the  ﬁrst  arrow  carries  (f1 , f2 )  to  (f1  − f2 , d(f1 ), d(f2 ))  and  the  second  arrow 
carries  (f , �1 , �2 )  to d(f ) − �2 + �1 .  (See  the  spectral  sequence  handout  for the general 
deﬁnition  of  the  total  complex  associated  to  a  double  complex.)

10.  (Required)  Let  k  be  a  ﬁeld  of  characteristic  zero  and  put X  = P
the  previous  exercises  to  show  that

In particular,  this computes  the right Betti numbers;  this  is a special case of a theorem 
of Grothendieck (whose proof uses GAGA). Also in particular, even though the scheme 
is  only  n-dimensional,  and  the  complex  only  goes  up  to  degree  n,  you  get  a  nonzero 
contribution  in  hypercohomology  in  degree  2n.  Optional:  replace  k  by  an  arbitrary 
ring  and  derive  a  similar  result. 

dimk Hi (X, �· 
X/k ) = 

11.  Let  k  be  a  ﬁeld  of  characteristic  zero,  and  let  P (x)  �  k [x]  be  a  polynomial  of  degree 
2g + 1  with  no  repeated  roots.  Let  X  be  the  (smooth  pro jective)  hyperelliptic  curve 
deﬁned  by  the  aﬃne  equation  y 2  = P (x).  Using  results  from  previous  exercises,  prove 
that

Again,  this  computes  the  expected  Betti  numbers. 
12.  Prove	 Hartshorne  Theorem  III.7.14.1  as  follows.  For  k  a  ﬁeld,  deﬁne  the  function 
 
i�Z ai ti dt  to  a−1 .  For  b  �  tk�t� −  t2k�t�,  deﬁne  sb  : 
Res  :  k((t)) dt  ⊕  k  sending  ⎩
k((t)) ⊕ k((t))  to  be  the  substitution  map

and  let  dsb  : k((t)) dt ⊕ k((t)) dt  be  the map 

i = 0 
i = 1 
i = 2 
i > 2.

(a)  Prove  that  for each positive  integer m,  the  composition Res ∼dsb  : t−mk�t� dt ⊕ k 
can  be  written  as  a  polynomial  Pm (a−1 , . . . , a−m , b1 , . . . , bm )  with  coeﬃcients  in 
Z,  not  depending  on  k . 
(b)  Use  (a)  to prove  that  for k = C, Res ∼dsb  = Res  for all  b.  (Hint:  one method uses 
the Cauchy  integral  formula.  Another method  involves  computing  the cokernel  of 
the map  d  .)dt 
(c)  Use  (a)  and  (b)  to  prove  that  for  any  ﬁeld  k ,  Res ∼dsb  = Res. 
(c)  Use  (c)  to  prove  Theorem  III.7.14.1.

13.  (Required) Let I ·  be a cohomologically graded complex  in nonnegative degrees consist­
ing of  injective  ob jects  (in  some  abelian category) which has no cohomology  in degrees 
0, . . . , r − 1.  Prove  that  we  can  split  I ·  as  a  direct  sum  of  two  complexes  of  injective

i  = 0  for  i > r ,  and  I2 
i  = 0  for  i < r .  (Hint:  ﬁrst

check  the  case  r = 1,  then  induct  on  r .)
