18.726:  Algebraic  Geometry  (K.S.  Kedlaya,  MIT,  Spring  2009)

Problem  Set  8  (due  Friday,  April  10,  in  class)


Please submit nine  of the following exercises,  including all items marked “Required”.  You 
may  assume  that all abelian categories under  consideration  admit  a  faithful additive  functor 
to Ab commuting with limits and colimits (so that diagram-chasing arguments become valid). 

1.  (Required)  Let  C  be  an  abelian  category.  Prove  that  the  category  of  complexes  with 
values  in  C  is  again  an  abelian  category. 

2.  (Required)  Prove  that  an  abelian  group  is  injective  if  and  only  if  it  is  divisible.  (This 
proof  was  sketched  in  class.) 

3.  (Required)  Let	 T  :  C1  ∈ C2  be  a  cohomological  functor  between  abelian  categories, 
·
such  that  T i  is  eﬀaceable  for  each  i >  0.  Complete  the  proof  that  T  is  universal. 
(Hint:  to  check  independence  from  the  choice  of  u,  you  may  want  to  use  a  pushout 
construction.) 

4.  Prove  the  acyclic  resolution  theorem.	 (Hint:  break  the  acyclic  resolution  up  into  a 
sequence  of  short  exact  sequences,  and  take  the  long  exact  homology  sequence  of  each 
piece.) 

5.  Prove  that  an  element  of ModR  is  pro jective  if  and  only  if  it  is  a  direct  summand  of  a 
free  module. 

6.  It  was  stated  in  class  that  “exact  functors  preserve  cohomology  of  complexes”.  Write 
down  what  this means  formally  and  then  prove  it. 

7.  (Required)  Suppose  that  the  abelian  category  C  admits  enough  injectives. 

(a)  Prove	 that  any  complex  in  nonnegative  degrees  admits  an  injective  resolution. 
(This  is  a  bit  ambiguous:  here  I  mean  a  single  complex  of  injectives  receiving  a 
map  from  the  original  complex  which  is  a  quasi-isomorphism.) 
(b)  Prove  that given any morphism  f  : C ∈ D ·  of complexes  in nonnegative degrees, 
·
and  any  injective  resolution  I of  C · ,  there  exist  an  injective  resolution  J of  D · 
·	
·
and  a morphism  I ∈ J inducing  f  on  cohomology. 
·
·

8.  (Required) Suppose  that  the  abelian category C  admits enough  injectives.  Write down 
a list of all of the compatibilities one must check in order to deﬁne right derived functors 
of a left exact functor F  in terms of injective resolutions, but do not  check them (except 
for  the  ones  handled  by  the  previous  exercise).  For  instance,  one  of  these  is  that  the 
ob ject  RiF (X )  is  well-deﬁned  up  to  canonical  isomorphism. 

9.  Let  C  be  an  abelian  category.

(a)  For  ob jects  M , N  in  C  and  i >  0,  consider  the  set  of  equivalence  classes  of  short 
exact  sequences  0  ∈  M  ∈  P  ∈  N  ∈  0  under  the  relation  that  two  sequences 
with  center  terms  P1 , P2  are  equivalent  if  there  is  a  diagram

(this  forces  P1  = P2  by  the  ﬁve  lemma,  so  this  is  indeed  an  equivalence  relation). 
Prove  that  the  operation  of  Baer  sum  gives  this  set  a  group  structure:  given  two 
sequences with center terms P1 , P2 , let P  be the quotient of P1 ×N P2  by the image 
of the map B ∈ P1 ×N P2  acting as B ∈ P1  on the ﬁrst factor and minus  B ∈ P2 
on  the  second  factor.  (This  is  sometimes  called  the  Yoneda  extension  group.) 
(b)  Prove that the construction in (a) is canonically isomorphic to the group Ext1 (N , M ). 
(c)  In  Ab,  the  short  exact  sequence  0  ∈  Z/pZ  ∈  P  ∈  Z/pZ  ∈  0  can  be  ﬁlled  in 
in  two  ways,  with  Z/pZ × Z/pZ  or  Z/p2Z.  However,  Ext1 (Z/pZ, Z/pZ) �= Z/pZ. 
Why  are  these  two  statements  not  contradictory? 

10.  Generalize  the  previous  exercise  as  follows.	 For  ob jects  M , N  in  C ,  consider  classes  of 
exact  sequences  0 ∈ M  ∈ Pn  ∈  · · · ∈  P1  ∈ N  ∈  0.  Construct  the  minimal  equiv­
alence  relation  under  which  two  sequences  are  equivalent  if  there  is  any  commutative 
diagram

but  without  any  hypothesis  on  the  arrows  Pi  ∈  Pi 
the  equivalence  relation  in  this  case;  this  condition  itself  is  not  symmetric.)  Deﬁne 
Baer  sum  in  this  case  to  be

0 ∈ Pn

��  ∈ 0

��  is  the  ﬁbred  coproduct  (pushout)  of  M  ∈  Pn  and  M  ∈  P n
� ,  and  P1 
��  is  the 
where  P n 
�  ∈ N . 
ﬁbred  product  (pullback)  of  P1  ∈ N  and  P1 

(a)  Prove  that  this  construction  gives  a  group.  (This  includes  checking  that  the Baer 
sum  respects  equivalence.) 
(b)  Prove  that  this  group  is  canonically  isomorphic  to  Ext i (M , N ).  (Hint:  one  way 
to  do  this  is  to  check  that  these  groups  together  form  an  eﬀaceable  cohomolog­
ical  functor.  This  means  that  given  a  short  exact  sequence  0  ∈  N1  ∈  N  ∈ 
N2  ∈  0,  you  must  interpret  the  connecting  homomorphism  � i  :  Exti (M , N2 )  ∈ 
Exti+1 (M , N1 )  in  terms  of  sequences.)

11.  Let G  be  a  group.  Prove  that  for  any  left Z[G]-module M ,  the  ﬁrst  group  cohomology 
group H 1 (G, M )  is  equal  to  the  quotient  of  the  group  of crossed  homomorphisms  (i.e., 
set  maps  f  :  G  ∈  M  satisfying  f (gh) =  g (f (h)) +  f (g )  for  all  g , h  �  G)  by  the 
subgroup  of  principal  crossed  homomorphisms  (i.e.,  crossed  homomorphisms  of  the 
form  f (g ) =  g (m) − m  for  some  m  �  M ).  (You  may  do  this  either  using  Yoneda 
extensions,  or using  an  explicit  construction  of a pro jective  resolution  of Z  in ModZ[G] . 
Beware  that  the Wikipedia  explanation  of  the  latter  appears  to  have  some  typos.) 

12.  Prove  that  ModR  has  enough  injectives  as  follows.  Given  M  � ModR ,  let  M  ∈ Q  be 
a monomorphism  of  abelian  groups  with  Q  divisible.  Prove  that 

M  = HomR (R, M ) ∈ HomAb (R, M ) ∈ HomAb (R, Q) 

may be viewed as a monomorphism of R-modules taking M  into an injective R-module. 
(We  will  prove  a more  general  result  later.) 

13.  Let 	 R  be  a  ring  and  let  M  be  an  R-module.  Prove  that  M  is  ﬂat  if  and  only  if 
Tor1 (R/I , M ) =  0  for  every  ﬁnitely  generated  ideal  I  of  R.  (Easy  corollary:  if  R  is  a 
principal  ideal  domain,  then M  is  ﬂat  if  and  only  if  it  is  torsion-free.)
