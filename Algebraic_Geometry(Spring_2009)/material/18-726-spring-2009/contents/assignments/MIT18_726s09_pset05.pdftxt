18.726:  Algebraic  Geometry  (K.S.  Kedlaya,  MIT,  Spring  2009) 
Problem  Set  5  (due  Friday,  March  13,  in  class) 

Please  submit  exactly  eleven  of  the  following  exercises,  including  all  exercises  marked 
“Required”.  In  case  it  comes  up,  you  may  use  Hartshorne’s  more  restrictive  deﬁnition  of 
pro jectivity  in  place  of mine. 

1.  This  is  to  make  up  for  the  incorrect  Eisenbud-Harris  problem  from  last  week.	 Show 
that  the  length  4  subschemes 

Spec R[x, y ]/(x 2 , y 2), 

Spec R[x, y ]/(x 2  − y 2 , xy ) 

of  Spec R[x, y ]  are  not  isomorphic,  but  their  ﬁbre  products  with  Spec C  over  Spec R 
are  isomorphic.  (Hint:  one  way  to  show  that  the  original  schemes  are  not  isomorphic 
is  to  compute  the  solutions  of  the  equation  z 2  = 0  in  both  rings.) 

2.  Hartshorne  II.3.7. 

3.  (Required)  Hartshorne  II.3.8. 

4.  Hartshorne  II.3.21  (you  should  read  II.3.20  ﬁrst,  but  don’t  submit  it). 

5.  (Required)  Let X  be  a  scheme,  and  let  {Ui }  be  an  open  aﬃne  cover  of X . 

(a)  Prove  that	 X  is  separated  if  and  only  if  for  each  pair  of  indices  i, j ,  Ui  � Uj  is 
aﬃne  and O(Ui  � Uj )  is  generated  (as  a  ring)  by  the  images  of O(Ui )  and O(Uj ). 
(You  did  part  of  this  on  the  previous  homework.) 
(b)  Use  this  criterion  to  give  another  proof  that  Pn 
Z  is  separated. 

6.  (Diﬃcult;  deﬁnitely  not  required)  Hartshorne  II.4.10. 

7.  (Required)  Describe  the  blowup  of  Spec Z[x]  at  the  point  (x, 2),  by  writing  down  a 
cover  by  open  aﬃnes  and  the  glueing  isomorphisms.  Also  describe  the  ﬁbre  over  the 
point  (x, 2). 

8.  Eisenbud-Harris  III-25. 

9.  (Required  if  you  have  access  to  Eisenbud-Harris)  Eisenbud-Harris  III-43. 

10.  Eisenbud-Harris  III-49. 

11.  (Required)  Hartshorne  II.5.11  and  Hartshorne  II.5.12  (these  count  as  one  exercise). 

12.  Hartshorne  II.5.13. 

13.  Hartshorne  II.5.14. 

14.  (Required)  Hartshorne  II.5.18.
