18.726:  Algebraic  Geometry  (K.S.  Kedlaya,  MIT,  Spring  2009) 
Problem  Set  9  (due  Friday,  April  17,  in  class) 

Please  submit  nine  of  the  following  exercises,  including  all  items  marked  “Required”. 

1.  (Required) Suppose that the (not necessarily paracompact)  topological  space  X  admits 
a  nice  basis  B  (i.e.,  a  neighborhood  basis  closed under  pairwise  intersections).  Let  F 
be  a  sheaf  of  abelian  groups  on  X  such that  Hˇ i (U, F ) = 0 for all  U  ∈  B .  Prove  that 
Hˇ i (X, F ) is  naturally  isomorphic  to  H i (X, F ) for  all  i ≥  0.  This  suﬃces  for  the  proof 
that  quasicoherent  sheaves  on  aﬃne  schemes  are  acyclic,  and  that  ˇCech  cohomology 
computes  the  sheaf  cohomology  of  any  quasicoherent  sheaf  on  a  separated  scheme (by 
taking  B  to  be  all  aﬃne  subschemes).  I’ll  address  the  comparison  between  ˇCech  and 
sheaf  cohomology  for  a  paracompact  topological  space  on  the  next  problem  set. 
Hint: Induct on  i. For the induction step, it suﬃces to prove that  Hˇ i(U, F ) =  H i (X, F ) 
for  each  cover  U  of  X  by  basic  opens.  To  do  this,  build  a  diagram

with  exact  rows  and  columns,  with  each  ∗  ﬂasque.  Then take global  sections and  argue 
using  a  diagram  chase.  (Again,  this  is  secretly  a  spectral  sequence  argument!)  See 
also  Hartshorne  Lemma  III.4.4  for  the  deﬁnition  of  the  natural  map,  and  Hartshorne 
exercise  III.4.4(c)  for  an  argument  in  the  case  i = 1. 

2.  (Required) 

(a)  If  you  did  not  submit  Hartshorne  II.1.16,  do  it  now. 

(b)  Otherwise,  answer  the  following  question.  Suppose  I  have  a  topological  space  X , 
a basis  B , and  a sheaf  F  whose restriction map  to each basic open set is surjective. 
Suppose  also  that 

0  → F  → G  → H  →  0 

is a short  exact  sequence of  sheaves of  abelian groups on  X . Where does the proof 
that  G (X ) → H(X ) is  surjective  break  down?

3.  (Required) Hartshorne III.2.1(a). 

4.  Hartshorne  III.2.1(b). 

5.  Hartshorne  III.2.2. 

6.  (counts  as  two) Harsthorne  III.2.3. 

7.  Hartshorne  III.2.7. 

8. 

(a)  Do  Hartshorne  III.3.1  following  the  hint. 

(b)  Do  Hartshorne  III.3.1  again  without  using  cohomology.  (For  this  argument,  you 
shouldn’t  need  any  noetherian  hypotheses.) 

(c)  Do  Hartshorne  III.3.2,  preferably  without  a  noetherian  hypothesis. 

9.  Hartshorne  III.3.8. 

10.  Do  Hartshorne  III.4.1  but  without  the  noetherian  hypothesis. 

11.  (Required) Hartshorne III.4.3. 

12.  Hartshorne  III.4.5. 

13.  Hartshorne  III.4.7. 

14.  Using  a  suitable  cover,  compute  the  singular  cohomology  of  the  n-sphere  S n . You may 
assume  without  proof  that  the  sheaf  cohomology  of  Z  computes  singular  cohomology, 
and  that this sheaf is acyclic  on a contractible space (i.e., the higher  singular cohomol­
ogy  of  a  contractible  space  vanishes).  (Hint:  your  answer  should  be Z  in degrees 0, n 
and  0  otherwise.  You  may  prefer  to  consider  using  an  open  cover  in  which  each  ﬁnite 
intersection  is  a  disjoint  union  of  contractible  sets,  but  not  necessarily  having  at  most 
one  connected  component.)
