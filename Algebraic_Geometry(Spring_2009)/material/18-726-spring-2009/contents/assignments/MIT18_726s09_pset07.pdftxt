18.726:  Algebraic  Geometry  (K.S.  Kedlaya,  MIT,  Spring  2009) 
Problem  Set  7  (due  Friday,  April  3,  in  class) 

Please  submit  exactly  nine  of  the  following  exercises, 
including  all  exercises  marked 
“Required”.  Besides  any  results  from  Hartshorne  chapters  I  and  II,  you  may  also  use  the 
Riemann-Roch  theorem (Theorem IV.1.3)  and  the Riemann-Hurwitz formula (Proposition 
IV.2.3  and  its  corollary). 

1.  (For  those  desiring more  practice  with  blowing  up)  Eisenbud-Harris  IV-45. 

2.  (Required) Hartshorne II.6.1. 

3.  Hartshorne  II.6.4. 

4.  Hartshorne  II.6.6. 

5.  Hartshorne  IV.1.6. 

6.  Hartshorne  IV.1.7. 

7.  (Required) Hartshorne IV.2.5. 

8.  Assume  that  k  has  characteristic  diﬀerent  from  3.  Prove  that  the  group  of  automor­
phisms  of  the  curve


x 3 y +  y 3 z +  z 3 x = 0


in  P2 
contains  a  subgroup  of  order  168;  since  this  curve  has  genus  3,  this  realizes  the 
k
Hurwitz bound 84(g − 1)  in  characteristic  zero from the previous  exercise.  (The group 
of  order  168  is  in  fact  the  full  group  of  automorphisms  even  if  the  characteristic  is 
nonzero, but you don’t have to prove this.) 

9.  Hartshorne  IV.3.1. 

10.  Hartshorne  IV.5.2. 

11.  (Required) Let  C  be  a  nonhyperelliptic  curve,  and  let  j  :  C  →  Pn
k denote the canonical 
embedding. 

(a)  Prove  that  the  image  of  j  is  not  contained  in  any  hyperplane. 
(b)  Prove  that  the  intersection  of  the  image  of  j  with  any  hyperplane  has  the  same 
length,  and  compute  that  length.  (This  computes  the degree  of  the  embedding.) 

12.  Let  C  be  a  pro jective,  irreducible,  nonsingular  curve  over  an  algebraically  closed  ﬁeld 
k .  Suppose  that  g (C ) =  3.  Prove  that  either  C  is  hyperelliptic,  or  C  is isomorphic to 
2
a nonsingular curve in  P
of  degree  4.  (Hint:  show  that  the  canonical embedding  is  a 
k
closed  immersion  if  and  only  if  C  is  not  hyperelliptic.)

13.  Assume  the  ﬁeld  k has characteristic diﬀerent from 2.  Let  P (x) ∈  k [x] be a polynomial 
with  no  repeated  roots,  and  let  C  be  the  normalization  of  the  Zariski  closure  in  P2 
k  of 
the  aﬃne  curve  Spec k [x, y ]/(y 2  −  P (x)). 

(a)  Compute  the  genus  of  C  by  explicitly  computing  a  basis  of  H 0(X, ΩX/k ).  (Hint: 
you  might  want  to  ﬁrst  change  coordinates  so  that  P  has  odd  degree 2g + 1.  In 
that  case,  the  genus  should  come  out  to  equal  g .) 
(b)  Verify  that  deg(K ) = 2g −  2  by  counting  the  zeroes  of  some  nonzero  section  of 
ΩX/k .
