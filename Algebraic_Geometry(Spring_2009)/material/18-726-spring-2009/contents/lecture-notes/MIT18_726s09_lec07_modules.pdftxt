Sheaves  of  modules  (updated  27  Feb  09) 

Having  discussed  sheaves  of  sets,  abelian  groups,  and  rings,  we  now  consider  sheaves  of 
modules  over  a  locally  ringed  space,  with  an  emphasis  on  the  situation  for  schemes.  We’ll 
then  use  what  we  know  to  talk  about  closed  immersions  and  separated  morphisms.  (Many 
more  properties  of  morphisms  to  follow  in  the  next  lectures!)  References:  Hartshorne  II.4, 
II.5;  EGA I 0.4, I 0.5, I 1.1. 

1  Sheaves  of  modules 

Let (X, OX )  be  a  ringed  space.  A  sheaf  of  OX -modules  is  a  sheaf  of  sets  F  such  that  for 
each  U  ⊆  X  open,  the  group  of  sections  F (U )  is  equipped  with  a  structure  of  a  OX (U )­
module,  in  a  fashion  compatible  with  restriction.  We  sometimes  call  such  a  thing  simply  an 
OX -module.  A  morphism  of  two  OX -modules  F  → G  is  a  morphism  of  sheaves  which  gives 
a  OX (U )-module homomorphism F (U ) → G (U ) for  each  U  ⊆  X  open. 
Fun fact: for  F  a  sheaf  of  OX -modules,  there  is  a  natural  bijection  between 

Hom(OX , F ) → F (X ). 

If  F  is  a  sheaf  of  OX -modules,  then  for  each  x  ∈  X ,  the  stalk  Fx  inherits  a  structure 
of  a  OX,x -module.  Using  that,  we  can  talk  about  submodules,  quotient  modules,  kernels, 
cokernels,  images,  and  the  like;  in  fact,  these  agree  with  the  corresponding  notions  in  the 
category  of  sheaves  of  abelian  groups. 
An  OX -module  is  free  if  it  is  isomorphic  to  a  direct  sum  OI  of  copies  of  OX .  This 
X 
property  cannot  be  checked  locally;  if  OX  is  only  locally  isomorphic  to  a  free  OX -module, 
we  say  it is  local ly free.  More  on  locally  free  sheaves  later. 
One  new  operation  is  the  tensor  product,  but  it  requires  some  care. 
OX -modules, the presheaf 

If  F , G  are  two 

U  �→ F (U ) ⊗OX  G (U ) 
may  not  be  a  sheaf.  Form  its  sheaﬁﬁcation,  and  call  that  F ⊗OX  G ;  it  has  the  expected 
arrow-theoretic  behavior.  (I might  forget  the  OX  sometimes  when  it  is  not  ambiguous.) 

2  Direct  and  inverse  image 

If  f  : (X, OX ) →  (Y , OY ) is  a  morphism  of  ringed  spaces,  and  F  is  a  OX -module, then  f∗F 
may  naturally  be  viewed  as  a  f∗OX -module.  Using  the  map  f ♯  :  OY  →  f∗OX ,  we  may  also 
give  f∗F  the  structure  of  an  OY  -module.  We  call  this  again  the  direct image  of  F . 
On  the  other  hand,  if  G  is  a  sheaf  of  OY  -modules,  then  f −1G  is  an  f −1OY  -module. 
Adjointness turns  f ♯  into a homomorphism f −1OY  → OX , so we can form the tensor product 

G ⊗f −1OY  OX 

1 

and  get  a  OX -module.  We  notate  this  f ∗G  and  call  it  the  (module-theoretic) inverse image 
of  G  under  f . 
Again,  f ∗  and  f∗  are  adjoint  in  the  obvious  fashion.  Statement  and  proof  left  to  the 
reader. 

3  Quasicoherent  sheaves  of  modules 

Since thinking about  aﬃne schemes is supposed to be equivalent to thinking  about  rings (after 
all,  the  two  categories  are  equivalent!),  we  would  like  our  thinking  about  sheaves  of  modules 
on  aﬃne  schemes  to  be  equivalent  to  thinking  about  modules  over  rings.  We  even  know 
what  the  functors  realizing  this  equivalence  should  be:  on  an  aﬃne  scheme  X  = Spec(R), 
we  should  go  from  R-modules  to  OX -modules  via  M  �→  M˜ (which  we  already  proved  is  a 
�→  Γ(X, F ). 
sheaf !),  and  back  via  F 
While  it  is  clear  that  the  composition  one  way  is  naturally  isomorphic  to  the  identity 
functor  on  R-modules,  the  other  way  fails  because  there  are  “too  many”  OX -modules.  For 
instance, for  R =  k [x] with  k  an  algebraically  closed  ﬁeld,  we  can  make  an  OX -module  F  by 
declaring 
 
�
0 
k [x] 
and  putting  in  the  obvious  restriction  maps.  This  sheaf  has  the  same  global  sections  as  OX 
itself  but  is  clearly  not  the  same! 
The  ﬁx  for  this  is  a  bit  heavy-handed:  we  simply  declare  that  we  only  want  sheaves 
which  locally  come  from  a  module  over  a  ring.  For  schemes,  it  is  clear  what  this  means: 
we  want  F  to  have  the  property  that  for  each  x ∈  X ,  there  is  an  open  aﬃne  neighborhood 
U  = Spec(A) of  x in  X  such  that  F |U  =  M˜ for  some  A-module  M . For locally  ringed  spaces, 
we must be a bit  more careful:  we want  F  to locally be given as the cokernel  of  some module 
X  → OJ  |U 
homomorphism  O I  |U
between free  OX -modules. 
X 
It  still  remains to  check  that this gives  what  we  expect for  aﬃne  schemes.  I  call  this the 
third  fundamental  theorem  of  aﬃne  schemes.

Theorem  1.  Let  F  be  a  quasicoherent  sheaf  of  OX -modules  for  X  =  Spec(R),  and  put 
∼
M  =  Γ(X, F ).  Then  the  natural  homomorphism  M˜ =  F  of  OX -modules  is  in  fact  an 
isomorphism. 
In  other  words,  the  category  of  quasicoherent  OX -modules  on  Spec(R)  is 
equivalent  to  the  category  of  modules  on  R. 

Proof.  The  claim  is  equivalent  to  the  fact  that  for  each  prime  ideal  p  of  R,  the  natural  map 
∼ ˜
Mp  =  Mp  → Fp  is  a  bijection.  Since  F  is  quasicompact,  we  can  ﬁnd  a  distinguished  open 
D(f )  of  X  on  which  F ∼ N˜ for  some  Rf -module  N . 
The  map  ˜

Mf  =  M |D(f )  → F |D(f )  =  N .  Taking  global  sections  gives  a  homomorphism  Mf  =  N  of 
Rf -modules. 
We  check  injectivity  of  Mf  →  N .  Suppose  m/f h  ∈  Mf  maps  to  zero  in  N .  For  each 
prime ideal  q  of  R,  we  can  ﬁnd  a  distinguished  open  neighborhood  D(g ) of  q  in  X  such  that

F |D(g)  =  P  for  some  Rg -module  P .  Now  Pf  =  Ng  =  Mf g  as  Rf g -modules  since  they  all 
give  rise  to  the  same  sheaf.  Hence  the  image  of  m/f h  in  Pf  is  zero,  so  the  image  of  m  in 
P  = Γ(D(g ), F ) is killed by some power of  f . We conclude that for some nonnegative integer 
j ,  f jm  restricts  to  the  zero  section  of  F  on  D(g ).  Since  this  holds  for  each  q,  and  we  only 
need  ﬁnitely  many  D(g ) to  cover  X  (since  X  is  quasicompact),  there  exists  a  nonnegative 
integer  j  such  that  f jm  = 0 in Γ(X, F ) =  M .  Hence  m/f h  represents  the  zero  element  in 
Mf . 
We  check  surjectivity  of  Mf  →  N .  Let  n  ∈  N  be  any  class.  Cover  X  with  ﬁnitely 
many  D(gi) on  each  of  which  F |D(gi )  is  represented  by  a  module  Pi  over  Rgi .  Then  FD(f gi ) 
is  represented by (Pi )gi .  Hence  for  some  j ,  f j n  is  the  restriction  to  D(f gi)  of  a  section  si 
of  F  over  D(gi ).  We  may  enlarge  j  so  that  it  works  for  all  i;  then  si  −  sj  represents  the 
zero  section  of  F  over  D(f gigj ).  By  the  previous  paragraph,  we  can  ﬁnd  some  k  such that 
f k (si  − sj ) is  the  zero  section  of  F  over  D(gigj ).  Ergo,  for  some  very  large  j , the  f j n  give 
sections  si  of  F  over  D(gi) which  glue  to  give  a  section  of  F  on  X  itself.

We  now  have  Mf  =  N ,  so  Mp  =  Np  =  Fp.  Since  p  ∈  X  was  arbitrary,  this  proves 
M˜ ∼ F .= 

4  Relative  Spec,  ideal  sheaves,  and  closed  immersions 

Let  X  be  a  scheme,  and  let  F  be a quasicoherent  sheaf  of  OX -modules  which  also  carries  an 
OX -algebra  structure (or for  short,  a  quasicoherent  OX -algebra  ).  Then  for  each  open  aﬃne 
subscheme  U  of  X ,  we  can form the  scheme Spec Γ(U, F ),  and  these  glue.  We  thus  obtain 
a  scheme  Y  =  Spec F  which  comes  with  a  morphism  Y  →  X .  This  is  called  the  relative 
spectrum  of  F . 
One  important  class  of  examples  of  relative  spectra  are  closed  immersions.  (For  more 
examples,  see  exercises.)  An  ideal  sheaf  on  a  locally  ringed  space  X  is  a  quasicoherent 
subsheaf  of  OX .  For  I  an  ideal  sheaf,  the  quotient  OX /I  is  a  quasicoherent  OX -algebra. 
Let  Z  be  its  relative  Spec;  any  map  arising  as  such  a  map  f  :  Z  →  X  is  called  a  closed 
immersion. 
Let  us  see  why  this  name  is  ﬁtting  in  the  case  of  schemes.  Say  X  = Spec R.  Then  an 
ideal  sheaf  corresponds  to  an  ideal  I  of  R,  and  Z  = Spec(R/I ).  (Notice  that  this  means 
that  any  closed immersion is an aﬃne and  ﬁnite morphism!)  The points of  Z  are in bijection 
with  the points  p ∈  X  where  the  stalks  Rp  and  Ip  diﬀer,  which  is  precisely  the  vanishing  set 
V (I ).  But  there  can  be  many  diﬀerent  closed  immersions  with  the  same  underlying  set!  For 
instance, in Spec k [x, y ], the ideals (x) and (x2) deﬁne  the  same  closed  set  but  not  the  same 
closed immersion. 
Beware that algebraic geometers have the habit  of  calling the source of  a closed immersion 
a  closed  subscheme  of  X  even  though  it’s  not  really  a  subscheme  of  X  in  any  precise  sense. 
But this isn’t  so  misleading  because the map  Z →  X  is  indeed  a  monomorphism.  And  there 
is something  comforting in the thought that (looking  at  our previous example)  the  x, y -plane 
“contains“  a  doubled  line  deﬁned  by  x2  =  0,  which  in  turn  “contains”  the  undoubled  line 
deﬁned by  x = 0. 

3 

Finally,  note  that  if  f  :  Z  →  X  is  a  closed  immersion,  the  deﬁning  ideal  sheaf  can  be 
recovered  as  the  kernel  of  f ♯  :  OX  →  f∗OZ .  In  fact,  following  Hartshorne,  you  may  deﬁne 
a  closed  immersion  as  a  map  of  schemes  f  :  Z  →  X  which  induces  a  homeomorphism  of  Z 
with  a  closed  subset  of  X ,  such  that  f ♯  :  OX  →  f∗OZ  is  surjective.  This  has  the  advantage 
that it is  clear that the property  of being  a  closed immersion is local  on the target (though 
you  can  check  it  the  other  way  too,  since  the  ideal  sheaf  is  uniquely  determined). 

5  Separated  schemes  and  morphisms 

We are now ready to introduce the analogue of  the Hausdorﬀ property for schemes.  However, 
it  is  more  natural  to  introduce  it  for  morphisms  of  schemes. 
A  morphism  f  :  Y  →  X  is  separated  if  the  diagonal  morphism  Δ :  Y  →  Y  ×X  Y  is  a 
closed immersion.  Since the formation of Δ, and  the property  of it being  a closed immersion, 
are  local  on  the  target,  so  is  the  notion  of  being  separated. 
For instance, if  X  = Spec k  for  k  a  ﬁeld,  and  Y  consists  of  two  copies  of  Spec k [x] glued 
along  Spec k [x, x−1 ], then Y  ×X  Y  is  the  aﬃne  plane  with  two  copies  of  each  axis,  and  four 
copies of the origin.  The image of Δ  contains two copies of the origin, but its closure contains 
all  four.  Hence  Y  →  X  is  not  separated. 

Lemma.  A  morphism  f  :  Y  →  X  is  separated  if  and  only  if  the  image  of  the  diagonal 
Δ :  Y  →  Y  ×X  Y  is  a  closed  subset  of  Y  ×X  Y . 

Proof.  See Hartshorne, Corollary II.4.2.  It relies on another useful (but  easy) fact:  any  aﬃne 
morphism  is  separated. 

We  say  a  scheme  itself  is  separated  if  its  unique  morphism  to  Spec(Z) is  separated.  This 
means  that  by  ﬁat  Spec(Z) is  itself  separated,  but  this  seems  reasonable  enough,  especially 
in  light  of  the  following. 

Theorem  2.  Let  X  be  a  separated  scheme.  Then  the  intersection  of  any  two  open  aﬃne 
subschemes  of  X  is  again  aﬃne. 

Proof.  Exercise.  (Beware  that  the  converse  is  false.  The  nonseparated  example  above  also 
satisﬁes  this  condition.) 

There  is  a  valuative  criterion  for  separatedness,  but  it  is  hardly  ever  useful  (because 
it  involves  arbitrary  valuation  rings,  which  can  be  rather  nasty);  see  Hartshorne  Theorem 
II.4.3. 

6  Separatedness  and  base  change 

Theorem  3.  Separatedness  is  stable  under  base  change. 

4 

Proof.  Let  f  :  Y  →  X  be  a  separated  morphism,  and  let  Z →  X  be  an  arbitrary  morphism. 
We  are  supposed  to  check  that  the  diagonal 

Y  ×X  Z →  (Y  ×X  Z ) ×Z  (Y  ×X  Z ) 

is  a  closed  immersion.  On  the  other  hand,  since  closed  immersions  are  stable  under  base 
change,  we  already  know  that 

Y  ×X  Z  →  (Y  ×X  Y ) ×X  Z 

is  a  closed  immersion.  It  thus  suﬃces  to  identify  the  two  right  sides  in  a  way  commuting 
with  the  arrows. 
The  way  to  see  this  is  to  use  the  functor  of  points:  given  W  →  X ,  we  must  identify  the 
maps into the two  right hand  sides in  a  natural  way.  The  maps to (Y  ×X  Y ) ×X  Z  give 
pairs of  maps  W  →  Y  ×X  Y  and  W  →  Z  which  agree  on  X , then (by  splitting  the  ﬁrst  ﬁbre 
product)  gives  triples  of  maps  W  →  Y ,  W  →  Y ,  and  W  →  Z  which  all  agree  on  X . 
The  maps  to  (Y  ×X  Z ) ×Z  (Y  ×X  Z )  similarly  give  pairs  of  maps  W  →  (Y  ×X  Z ), 
W  →  Y  ×X  Z  which  agree  on  Z .  Splitting  again,  we  get  quadruples  W  →  Y ,  W  →  Z , 
W  →  Y ,  W  →  Z  which  agree  on  X ,  but  moreover  the  two  maps  W  →  Z  must be the  same 
map.  We  thus  identify  with  the  previous  description.
