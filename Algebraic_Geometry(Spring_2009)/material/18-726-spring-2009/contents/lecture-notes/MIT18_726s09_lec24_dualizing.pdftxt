Dualizing  sheaves  and  Riemann-Roch  (updated  6  May  09) 

In  this  lecture,  we  introduce  dualizing  sheaves  for  pro jective  schemes  over  a  ﬁeld,  then 
use  them  to  derive  the  Riemann-Roch  theorem  for  curves.  Throughout,  let  k  be  a  ﬁeld (not 
PN
necessarily  algebraically  closed),  let  j  :  X  →  P  = 
k  be  a  closed  immersion  with  X  of 
dimension  n,  and  let  OX (1) be  the  corresponding  twisting  sheaf. 

1  Dualizing  sheaves 

For  V  a  k -vector  space,  let  V ∨  denote  the  dual  space  Homk (V , k).  A  dualizing  sheaf  for  X 
is  a  coherent  sheaf  ω ◦  equipped  with  a  trace morphism  t  :  H n(X, ω ◦  ) →  k ,  such  that  for  all 
X 
X
coherent  sheaves  F  on  X ,  the  composition 

X ) ×  H n(X, F )
HomX (F , ω ◦ 

t 
→  H n (X, ω ◦  →  k
X ) 

of  the  natural  pairing  with  the  trace  morphism  induces  an  isomorphism 

∼
HomX (F , ω ◦  ) =  H n (X, F )∨  .
X 

By  interpreting  this  in  terms  of  representing  a  certain  functor,  we  see  that  a  dualizing  sheaf 
is  unique  up  to  unique  isomorphism  if  it  exists. 

Theorem.  There  exists  a  dualizing  sheaf  for  X . 

This  also  holds  when  X  is  proper,  but  I  won’t  give  the  proof  in  this  course  (see  the 
references  at  the  end  of  Hartshorne  III.7). 
The previous theorem is not so useful  unless one can identify the dualizing  sheaf  explicitly. 
This  is  tricky  in  general,  but  can  be  done  well  in  the  smooth  case. 

Theorem.  Suppose  that  X  is  smooth  and  irreducible  over  k .  Then  the  canonical  sheaf  ωX 
is  a  dualizing  sheaf. 

2  Application  to  Riemann-Roch 

Modulo  the  previous  two  theorems,  we  can  already  deduce  Riemann-Roch  for  curves.  Sup­
pose  in  this  section  that  k  is  algebraically  closed,  and  that  X  is  smooth  over  k , irreducible, 
and  of  dimension  1. 
∼
For  any  divisor  D  on  X ,  the  identiﬁcation  of  the  canonical  sheaf  ωX  = ΩX/k  with  the 
dualizing  sheaf  ω ◦  gives  us  an  isomorphism 
X 

H 0(X, ωX  ⊗ L(−D)) ∼ HomX (L(D), ωX )
= 
∼ HomX (L(D), ω ◦ 
X ) 
= 
∼=  H 1(X, L(D))∨  .

This  tells  us  several  useful  things.  First,  the  genus  g  =  g (X ),  which  is  typically  deﬁned  as 
dimk H 0(X, ωX ), is also equal to dimK  H 1(X, O).  Second, the desired  statement  of Riemann-
Roch  is  now 

? 
dimk H 0(X, L(D)) − dimk H 0(X, ωX  ⊗ L(−D)) 
deg(D) + 1 − g  = 
= dimk H 0(X, L(D)) − dimk H 1(X, L(D)) 
=  χ(X, L(D)). 

Third, Riemann-Roch does indeed hold for  D  = 0 (by  the previous two  assertions). 
To  ﬁnish  the  proof,  it  is  enough  to  show  that  the  Riemann-Roch  equality  for  a  given 
divisor  D  is  equivalent  to  its  truth  for  the  divisor  D  + (Q) for  any  closed  point  Q ∈  X (k). 
(With that in hand, we can walk from 0 to any  other divisor by  adding  or subtracting points.) 
So  let  us  see  how  much  both  sides  of  the  Riemann-Roch  equality  change  when  we  add  the 
point  Q.  On  one  hand,  obviously 

(deg(D + (Q)) + 1 − g ) − (deg(D) + 1 − g ) = 1. 

On  the  other  hand,  we  have  a  short  exact  sequence 

0  → L(D) → L(D + (Q)) → OQ  →  0 

where  OQ  denotes  the  skyscraper  sheaf  k  at the point  Q.  Since  Euler  characteristics  add  in 
short  exact  sequences, 

χ(X, L(D + (Q))) − χ(X, L(D)) =  χ(X, OQ ) = 1. 

Hence Riemann-Roch for  D  is  equivalent  to  Riemann-Roch  for  D + (Q). 

3  Construction  of  the  dualizing  sheaf 

We  now go back  and  construct dualizing  sheaves following  the  argument in Hartshorne (but 
ﬂeshing  out  some  details  which  he  leaves  opaque).  Recall  that  we  already  know  the  duality 
theorem for  X  =  P ,  with  the  dualizing  sheaf  being  the  canonical  sheaf  ωP .  The  plan  is  to 
manufacture  a  dualizing  sheaf  on  X  out  of  ωP ,  using  Serre  duality  for  P .  That  tells  us  that 
∼
if  we  ﬁx  an  isomorphism  H N (P , ωP ) =  k  of  k -vector  spaces,  then  for  any  coherent  sheaf  F 
on  X , 

H n (X, F ) = 

H n(P , j∗F ) ∼ ExtN −n 
(j∗F , ωP )∨  .
= 
P 

So  we  are  reduced  to  ﬁnding  a  sheaf  ω ◦  on  X  for  which  there  is  a  functorial  isomorphism 
X 

∼ ExtN −n (j∗F , ωP ). 
◦  ) = 
HomX (F , ωX 
P 

(We  then  get  the  required  trace  map  H n (X, ω ◦  )  →  k  by  tracing  the  identity  element  of 
X 
HomX (ω ◦  , ω ◦  ) through  the identiﬁcations.)

One  might  imagine  that  this  isomorphism  comes  from  an  isomorphism  of  sheaves

Hom X (F , ω ◦  ) ∼ Ext N −n (j∗F , ωP )

by  taking  global  sections.  Taking  F  =  OX  in  this  hypothetical  isomorphism  suggests  the 
right deﬁnition: 

ω ◦  =  j ∗ Ext N −n (j∗OX , ωP ).

We  would  like  to  get  back  from  this  to  the  claimed  isomorphism

(local version: for  A a ring,  I  an ideal,  M  ∈  ModA/I ,  N  ∈  ModA , we identify HomA (M , N ) ∼= 
HomA/I (M , HomA (A/I , N ))),  then  evaluating  the  resulting  derived  functors  at  ωP ,  then 
taking  global  sections.  This  is  complicated  by  the  fact  that  in  the  second  step,  Hom X (F , ·) 
is  not  exact,  and  in  the  third  step,  taking  global  sections  is  not  exact. 
To straighten these things out, we need  to know more about the relationship between the 
sheaf  Ext  and  the global Ext.  For  starters, here is  one thing  I can say  using  Serre  vanishing. 
(See Hartshorne Proposition III.6.9.) 
Proposition.  Let  F  and  G  be  coherent  sheaves  on  X .  Then  there  exists  an  integer  q0 
depending  on  F  and  G ,  such  that  for  every  q  ≥  q0 ,  we  have 
Exti  (F , G (q)) ∼ Γ(X, Ext i 
(F , G )(q)).
=
X 
X
Proof.  This holds for  i  = 0  without  any  restriction  on  q . For  F  locally  free,  the  right  side  is 
zero for  i >  0, whereas the left  side vanishes for  n  large enough by Serre’s vanishing  theorem. 
The general  case then follows by  a dimension  shifting  argument;  see Hartshorne Proposition 
III.6.9. 

Next,  I  must  recall  a  theorem  which  I  skipped  over  earlier. 

Theorem  (Grothendieck).  For  any  F ∈  ShAb (X ),  H i (X, F ) = 0  for  i > n. 

Proof.  This  holds  with  X  replaced by  any  noetherian topological  space of dimension  n. The 
argument is a rather elaborate dimension-shifting  argument;  see Hartshorne Theorem III.2.7. 
(See  also  Hartshorne  exercise  III.4.8(d),  which  is  enough  for  this  discussion.) 
i  (j∗F , ωP ) = 0  for  i < N  − n. 
Corollary.  For  any  coherent  sheaf  F  on  X ,  we  have  Ext P
Proof.  Put  Fi  =  Ext i
P (j∗F , ωP ).  On  one  hand,  for  q  large, 
∼
Γ(P , Fi(q)) = Exti
P (j∗F , ωP (q)) =  H N −i(P , j∗F (−q))∨ 
by  Serre  duality  for  P .  For  i < N  −  n,  H N −i (P , j∗F (−q))  =  0  by  the  theorem.  Hence 
Γ(P , Fi(q))  = 0 for  q  large.  On  the  other  hand,  since  Fi  is  coherent,  for  q  large,  Fi (q) is 
generated  by  global  sections.  This  forces  Fi (q) = 0 for  q  large,  whence  Fi  = 0.

At  this  point,  we  can  ﬁnish  with  the  following  argument;  compare  Hartshorne  Lemma 
III.7.4. 
(Once  again,  there  is  a  spectral  sequence  hiding  behind  this,  but  never  mind.) 
Take  an  injective  resolution  I ·  of  ωP ,  so  we  can  compute  Ext ·  (j∗F , ωP ) as  the  cohomology 
of  Hom P (j∗F , I ·  ),  and  similarly  for  Ext  and  Hom.  But  using  the  canonical  identiﬁcation 
from  earlier,  if  we  write  J ·  =  j ∗Hom P (j∗OX , I ·  ),  we  can  also  compute Ext ·(j∗F , ωP ) as  the 
cohomology  of  Hom X (F , J ·),  and  similarly  for  Ext  and  Hom.  So  now  what  we  need  to 
know is that

Hom X (F , ωX 
and  similarly  with  straight  Homs. 
However,  the  sheaves  J ·  are  injective  OX -modules. 
if  A  is  a  ring,  I 
(Local  version: 
an  ideal,  and  I  ∈  ModA  is  injective,  then  HomA (A/I , M )  is  an  injective  A/I -module;  this 
uses  the  previous  local  identiﬁcation.)  By  the  previous  corollary,  the  complex  J ·  (whose 
cohomology  computes  Ext ·(j∗OX , ωP )) is  acyclic  in  degrees  up  to  N  − n  − 1.  We  can  then 
split  it  into  two  complexes  of  injectives  J1

degrees  up  to  N  − n,  and  J2 
·  is  a  bounded  complex  of  injectives,  it  splits  into  a  series  of  split  short  exact 
Since  J1 
sequences;  thus it  stays  exact  no  matter  what left  exact functors you  apply  to it.  So  we  can

4  Calculation of the dualizing sheaf for smooth schemes 

To  ﬁnish  the  proof  of  Riemann-Roch,  we  must  still  show  that  we  can  take  ω ◦  =

X  is  smooth  over  k .  Fortunately,  this  is  a  local  problem.

Theorem.  Suppose  that  X  is  a  local  complete  intersection  in  P .  Let  I  be  the  ideal  sheaf  of 
X .  Then  there  is  a  canonical  isomorphism 

r 
∼
Ext P (j∗OX , ωP ) =  ωP  ⊗ j∗OX  ⊗ ∧r (I /I 2 )∨  . 

The  local  complete  intersection  condition  asserts  that  I  is locally generated by  N  −  n 
elements;  this  is  true  for  X  smooth  basically  by  the  Jacobian  criterion.  See  Hartshorne 
Theorem  II.8.17.  The  fact  that  the  right  side  gives  ωX  comes  from  the  exact  sequence 

0  → I /I 2  →  ΩP /k  ⊗ j∗OY  →  j∗ΩY /k 

by  taking  exterior  powers;  see  Hartshorne  Proposition  II.8.20.  The  stated  theorem  itself  is 
proved  by  computing  in  local  coordinates;  see  Hartshorne  Theorem  III.7.11
