18.726:  Algebraic  Geometry  (K.S.  Kedlaya,  MIT,  Spring  2009) 
Category  theory  (updated  8  Feb  09) 

We’re  going  to  use  the  language  of  category  theory  freely.  Fortunately,  it’s  easy  to  learn 
because  it  corresponds  naturally  to  the way  you  (hopefully)  already  think  about mathemat­
ical ob jects.  (I could give a reference,  but  in  fact you  should be ﬁne  just  looking these  things 
up  in Wikipedia.) 

1  Warning:  set-theoretic  diﬃculties 

Category  theory  is  a bit  tricky  because  it  tries  to deal with  ob jects  like  “the  ???  of all  sets”, 
or  all  rings,  or  whatnot.  Russell’s  paradox  shows  that  there  is  in  fact  no  set  of  all  sets. 
Namely,  if  there  were,  it  would  have  a  subset  consisting  of  those  sets  U  for  which  U  →/ U . 
But  that  would  then  be  a  set  V ,  and  if  V  → V  then  V  →/ V  and  vice  versa. 
The  way  around  this  is  to  tamper  with  the  axioms  of  set  theory  slightly,  by  introducing 
the  notion  of  a  class.  A  class  is  something  which  behaves  just  like  a  set  whose  members  are 
sets,  except  that  there  is  no  power  axiom;  there  is  not  guaranteed  to  be  a  class  consisting 
of  all  subclasses  of  a  given  class.  Unless,  that  is,  your  class  consists  just  of  the  elements  of 
some  actual  set.  (You  might  then  ask  what  kind  of  ob ject  is  the  ???  of  all  classes.  Never 
mind  that  for  now.)  We  also  assume  there  is  a  class  of  all  sets,  called  the  universe. 
Except  for  the  power  axiom,  you  may  perform  operations  on  classes  like  you  do  with 
sets.  For  instance,  given  a  class  C  and  a  logical  statement  P  depending  on  a  single  set, 
you  can  form  the  subclass  of  C  consisting  of  all  elements  for  which  P  is  true.  You  can  also 
form  Cartesian  products  indexed  by  sets,  although  I’ll  hardly  ever  do  this  except  for  ﬁnite 
products.  (There  is  also  an  axiom  of  choice  at  the  class  level.) 
A  class  is  smal l  if  its  elements  are  in  bijection  with  some  set. 

2  Categories,  and  examples 

A  category  C  consists  of  the  following  data. 

•	 A  class  of  objects,  denoted  Ob j(C ). 

•	 For each ordered pair of ob jects (X, Y ), a set of morphisms, denoted Hom(X, Y ).  (You 
may  think  of  this  as  an  element  of  the  Cartesian  product  of  two  copies  of  C  and  one 
copy  of  the  universe.) 

•	 For  each  ordered  triple  of  ob jects  (X, Y , Z ),  a  function  ≤ : Hom(Y , Z ) × Hom(X, Y ) � 
Hom(X, Z ),  called  composition, which  satisﬁes  the  following  properties. 

–	 The  associative  law :  given  an  ordered  quadruple  of  ob jects  (X, Y , Z, W ),  the  two 
ways  to  compose Hom(Z, W ) × Hom(Y , Z ) × Hom(X, Y )  to Hom(X, W )  give  the 
same  answer.

–	 The identity law :  for each ob ject X , there must exist a morphism idX  → Hom(X, X ) 
which  is  an  identity  under  composition  on  either  side.  Note  that  idX  is  forced  to 
be  unique  by  this  condition. 

(I have a habit of calling morphisms “arrows” because they are usually pictorially represented 
as  such.) 
This deﬁnition is meant to capture many, if not all, basic types of structured mathematical 
ob jects.  Examples: 

•	 The  category  of  sets,  denoted  Set,  where  Hom(X, Y )  is  all  functions  from X  to  Y . 

•	 The  category  of  topological  spaces,  denoted  Top,  where  Hom(X, Y )  is  all  continuous 
functions  from X  to  Y . 

•	 The  category  of  (commutative,  unital)  rings,  denoted  Ring,  where  Hom(X, Y )  is  all 
ring  homomorphisms  from X  to  Y . 

•	 The category of topological rings, denoted TopRing, where Hom(X, Y ) is all continuous 
ring  homomorphisms  from X  to  Y . 

•	 The  category  of  modules  over  a  ﬁxed  ring  R,  denoted  ModR ,  where  Hom(X, Y )  is  all 
R-module  homomorphisms  from X  to  Y . 

And so  forth.  I’ll  leave  to your  imagination the deﬁnitions  of some more categories  for which 
I might  need  names  later:  Ab  (abelian  groups),  Grp  (groups),  TopGp  (topological  groups). 
However,  there are other things that can be viewed as categories.  An important example: 
given  any  partially  ordered  set  S , make  a  category  in  which  the  ob jects  are  the  elements  of 
S ,  and  there  is  exactly  one morphism  from X  to  Y  if X  � Y  and  none  otherwise. 
Important  special  case  of  the  previous  one:  given  a  topological  space  S ,  we  can  make  a 
category in which the ob jects are the open subsets of S , and the morphisms are the inclusions 
of  one  open  subset  into  another. 
Another  example  comes  from  algebra.  Given  a  group,  we  can  make  a  category  with 
only  one  ob ject  X ,  in  which  Hom(X, X )  is  the  group  and  the  composition  law  is  the  group 
operation. 
Here’s a more interesting example along the lines of the previous one.  Given a topological 
space  S , make  a  category  in which  the  ob jects  are  the  points  of  S ,  and  the morphisms  from 
X  to Y  are  the  continuous  functions  f  :  [0, 1] � S  with  f (0) = X  and  f (1) = Y .  Deﬁne  the 
composition  g ≤ f  for  g  → Hom(Y , Z )  and  f  → Hom(X, Y )  to  be  the  function  h  :  [0, 1] �  S 
with 
 
�
f (2x) 
x →  [0, 1/2]
g (2x − 1)  x →  [1/2, 1]. 
This  is  a  special  case  of  turning  a  groupoid  (something  which  is  like  a  group  except  that 
ob jects  can  only  be  composed  if  they  satisfy  a  matching  condition)  into  a  category.  This 
example  comes  from  the  fundamental  groupoid  of  a  topological  space.

Interlude:  “is”  versus  “does” 

The  rigorous  formulation  of  category  theory  exposes  a  dark  secret  of  mathematics:  ob jects 
in  a  category  are  rarely  ever  equal.  For  instance,  we  all  think  we  agree  on  what  the  ring  Z 
is,  but  if we  all  sat  down  and wrote  down  set-theoretic  deﬁnitions,  probably  no  two  of  them 
would  exactly match.  The point  is  that we  conceive  of Z,  and  of most mathematical  ob jects 
in  general,  not  in  terms  of  what  they  literally  are  as  sets,  but  by  how  they  work,  and  in 
particular  how  they  relate  to  other mathematical  ob jects. 
The  solution  for  this  suggested  by  category  theory  is  to  characterize  interesting  mathe­
matical  ob jects  using  universal  properties.  For  instance,  the  ring  Z  is  characterized  by  the 
fact  that  it  is  an  initial  object  in  the  category  of  rings:  for  every  ring  Y ,  there  is  a  unique 
morphism  from  Z  to  Y .  Any  two  ob jects  with  this  property  are  uniquely  isomorphic. 
Here  are  a  few  other  “arrow-theoretic”  properties  that  can be  used  for  this  purposes.  I’ll 
talk more  about  universal  properties  later. 

•	 Y  →  Ob j(C )  is  a  ﬁnal  object  in  C  if  for  any  X  →  Ob j(C ),  there  is  a  unique  morphism

from X  to  Y .  An  ob ject  which  is  both  initial  and  ﬁnal  is  a  terminal  object.


•	 A  morphism  f  →  Hom(X, Y )  is  a  monomorphism  if  for  any  g , h  →  Hom(W, X ),  if 

f  ≤ g  =  f  ≤ h,  then  g  =  h.  In  the  category  of  sets  (and  many  other  examples),  f  is  a

monomorphism  if  and  only  if  f  is  injective.


•	 A morphism  f  → Hom(X, Y )  is  an  epimorphism  if  for  any  g , h → Hom(Y , Z ),  if  g ≤ f  =

h  ≤  f ,  then  g  =  h.  In  the  category  of  sets  (and  many  other  examples),  f  is  an

epimorphism  if  and  only  if  f  is  surjective.  But  beware  of  surprises:  for  example,

the morphism  Z � Q  of  rings  is  an  epimorphism  (and  also  a monomorphism).


•	 A morphism  f  → Hom(X, Y )  is  an  isomorphism  if  it  has  a  two-sided  inverse.  This  im­

plies  that  it  is a monomorphism  and an epimorphism,  but not conversely  (see previous

example).


4  Functors  and  natural  transformations 

Functors  can  be  thought  of  as  “functions  between  categories”.  A  covariant  functor  from  a 
category  C1  to  a  category  C2  consists  of: 

•	 A  function  F  from Ob j(C1 )  to Ob j(C2 ). 

•	 For  each  pair  (X, Y )  of  Ob j(C1 ),  a  function  FX,Y  : Hom(X, Y ) � Hom(F (X ), F (Y )),

such  that  F  commutes  with  composition  and  F  carries  idX  to  idF (X ) .


A contravariant functor  works the same way except that FX,Y  carries Hom(X, Y ) to Hom(F (Y ), F (X )),

that  is,  it  reverses  the  sense  of  the  morphisms.  You  can  turn  it  into  a  covariant  functor  by

replacing  one  of  the  two  categories  with  its  opposite  category,  in  which  all  morphisms  are

reversed;  for  simplicity,  let  us  just  talk  about  covariant  functors  for  the moment.


3 

This  point  is  actualized  by  the  notion  of  a  natural  transformation.  Given  two  functors 
F1 , F2  from C1  to C2 , a natural  transformation  of F1  to F2  consists of, for each X  → Ob j(C1 ), a 
morphism  �X  : F1 (X ) � F2 (X )  such  that  for  every morphism  f  → Hom(X, Y ),  the  diagram 

F1 (f )

F1 (X ) 

� F1 (Y ) 

�X 

� �
F2 (X ) 

F2 (f )

�Y 

� �
� F2 (Y ) 

is  commutative  (that  is,  if  you  trace  around  both  ways  you  get  the  same  answer).  Natural 
transformations can be composed;  one with an inverse  (equivalently,  in which the morphisms 
�X  are  all  isomorphisms)  is  called  a  natural  isomorphism.  For  instance,  the  functors  taking 
ordered  triples  (M1 , M2 , M3 )  of modules  over  a  ring R  to 

(M1  �R  M2 ) �R  M3 

and  M1  �R  (M2  �R  M3 ) 

are  naturally  isomorphic. 

5  Other  properties  of  functors 

A  functor is  faithful  if the maps FX,Y  are  injective.  Typical  examples of these are “forgetful” 
functors,  in  which  you  start  with  a  category  of  ob jects  carrying  a  lot  of  structure,  and  the 
functor  strips  oﬀ  some  structure.  E.g.,  take  groups  to  their  underlying  sets,  or  take  rings  to 
their  additive  groups,  or  take  topological  groups  to  their  underlying  topological  spaces. 
The  analogues  of  injectivity  and  surjectivity  for  functors  are: 

•	 A  functor  is  ful ly  faithful  if  the  maps  FX,Y  are  bijective.  A  typical  example  is  the 
inclusion  of  a  ful l  subcategory  (i.e.,  take  some  of  the  ob jects,  and  all  of  the morphisms 
between  the  chosen  ob jects). 

•	 A  functor  is essential ly  surjective  if every  ob ject  in C2  is  isomorphic  to an ob ject of the 
form  F (X )  for  some  X  → Ob j(C1 ). 

•	 A  functor  is  an  equivalence  of  categories  if  it  is  fully  faithful  and  essentially  surjective. 
This  is  equivalent  to  the  existence  of  a  quasi-inverse  functor,  i.e.,  one  for  which  the 
compositions  in  both  directions  are  naturally  isomorphic  to  the  relevant  identities. 

A  typical  example  from  last  semester:  take  the  category  of  aﬃne  algebraic  varieties  over 
an  algebraically  closed  ﬁeld  k .  The  functor �  computing  regular  functions  is  an  equivalence 
between  this  category  and  (the  opposite category  of ) ﬁnitely  generated k-algebras which  are 
reduced  (have  no  nilpotent  elements).  One  of  the  goals  of  schemes  is  to  set  up  a  similar 
equivalence  between  some  sort  of  geometric  ob jects  and  the  category  of  al l  commutative 
unital  rings.

6	 Representable  functors,  Yoneda’s  lemma,  and  uni­
versal  properties 

An  individual  ob ject  in  a  category  casts  a  sort  of  shadow  on  the  entire  category,  via  the 
notion  of  representable  functors.  For a ﬁxed  ob ject X  in  a category  C ,  let  hX  be  the  functor 
from  C  to  Set  such  that  hX (Y )  =  Hom(X, Y ),  and  the  image  of  f  →  Hom(Y , Z )  under  hX 
carries  Hom(X, Y )  to  Hom(Y , Z )  via  postcomposition  with  f . 
It turns out that any natural transformation from hX  to any other  functor F  : C � Set is 
determined  by  specifying  the  image  of  the  special  element  idX  of Hom(X, X ) = hX (X ),  and 
conversely  any  such  choice  induces  a natural  transformation  from hX  to F .  This  is Yoneda’s 
lemma ;  proof  is  left  as  an  (easy)  homework  problem. 
An  arbitrary  functor  F  :  C �  Set  is  representable  if  it  is  naturally  isomorphic  to  hX 
for  some  X .  By  Yoneda’s  lemma,  if  X  and  Y  represent  the  same  functor,  then  they  are 
isomorphic  in  a  “natural”  way  (i.e.,  one  compatible  with  the  action  of  the  functor). 
In  practice,  this  is  usually  interpreted  as  saying  that  an  ob ject  of  a  category  determined 
by  a  universal  mapping  property  is  unique  up  to  unique  isomorphism  (or  up  to  natural 
isomorphism ).  Here  is  an  example  of  this  which  will  help  explain  why  categorical  thinking 
is  so  helpful  when  dealing  with  schemes.  For  ob jects  X, Y  in  a  category  C ,  an  (absolute) 
product  of  X  and  Y  is  an  ob ject  Z  equipped  with  maps  Z  �  X  and  Z  �  Y ,  with  the 
following  universal  mapping  property.  Given  any  ob ject  W  and  morphisms  W  �  X  and 
W  � Y ,  there must  be  a  unique  morphism W  � Z  such  that  the  diagram 
W

� � � � � � � � � � � � � � �

X	
Y 
commutes.  The  product  is  unique  in  the  sense  that  if  Z �  is  an  other  ob ject  equipped  with 
morphisms  Z �  � X  and  Z �  � Y  satisfying  the mapping  property,  there  is  a  unique  isomor­
phism  Z � Z �  making  everything  commute. 
In  any  “normal”  category,  in  which  ob jects  are  sets  equipped  with  some  extra  structure 
(e.g.,  groups,  topological  groups),  products  exist  and  can  be  written  as  Cartesian  products 
with  some  appropriate  extra  structure.  But  in  general,  products  need  not  exists,  and  even 
if  they  do  they  might  look  weird.  Case  in  point:  suppose  we  tried  to  make  a  theory  of 
abstract  algebraic varieties  over  the  non-algebraically  closed  ﬁeld Q,  in which  the  points  are 
Galois  orbits  of points  over Q.  (This  is  close  to what will  happen with  schemes,  except  that 
there  will  be  some  more  points.)  Then  in  the  aﬃne  line,  we  have  a  variety  consisting  of 
the  single  orbit  {i, −i}.  The  product  of  this  with  itself  will  then  consist  of  the  two  orbits 
{(i, i), (−i, −i)}  and  {(i, −i), (−i, i)}.

7  Limits  and  colimits 

The  universal  mapping  properties  we  will  consider  can  all  be  wrapped  into  the  following 
framework.  Let  C , D  be  two  categories.  A  diagram  on  C  of  type  D  is  just  a  functor  from  D 
to  C . 
Fix  a  diagram  F  : D � C .  Let  D �  be  the  category  formed  from  D  by  adding  one  extra 
ob ject  I  with  a  unique  morphism  to  every  ob ject  in  D �  (and  the  obvious  composition  law). 
Now  look  at  extensions  of  F  to  functors  D �  � C ;  that  is,  you  have  to  add  one  ob ject  X 
of  C  and  maps  X  �  F (Y )  for  each  Y  → D  which  commute  with  the  maps  coming  from 
the  diagram.  A  limit  of  F  is  a  universal  set  of  such  data,  i.e.,  any  other  extension  factors 
uniquely  through  this  one.  My  example  of  a  product  is  the  case  where  D  consists  of  two 
ob jects  and  no morphisms. 
Deﬁne  colimits  as  limits  in  the  opposite  category.  For  example,  the  co-analogue  of  the 
product  is  the  coproduct.  In  Set,  the  product  is  the  Cartesian  product,  while  the  coproduct 
is  the  disjoint  union. 
Important special case:  a directed  set  is a partially ordered set  in which any two elements 
have a common upper bound.  (I.e., for any x, y , there is some z with x � z , y � z .  A diagram 
from a directed set into some category C  is called a direct  system ; a colimit of a direct system 
is  called  a  direct  limit,  or  an  inductive  limit,  in  C .  (It  should  be  called  a  direct/inductive 
colimit.  Sorry  about  that.)  For  example,  take  the  natural  numbers  under  divisibility;  then 
1 Z  is  the  group Q. 
the  direct  limit  of  the  abelian  groups  n 
A  diagram  from  the  opposite  of  a  directed  set  into  some  category  C  is  called  an  inverse 
system ;  a  colimit  of  an  inverse  system  is  called  an  inverse  limit  (or  projective  limit ).  For 
example,  view  the  nonnegative  integers  as  a  partially  ordered  set  using  the  reverse  of  the 
usual ordering.  Then  for any  ring R,  the  inverse  limit of  the rings R[x]/(xn )  is  the  ring R�x� 
of  formal  power  series.  (A  similar  example  is  the  p-adic  numbers.) 

8  Adjoint  functors 

One  other notion  that comes  up  a  lot  is  that  of an  adjoint  pair  of  functors, which  you might 
like  to  think  of  as  category-theoretic  analogues  of  a  linear  operator  and  its  transpose. 
Let  C , D  be  categories.  A  pair  of  functors  F �  :  C  � D  and  F�  : D � C  form  an  adjoint 
pair  if  we  can  form  bijections 

HomC (F �X, Y ) � HomD (X, F�Y ) 

which  are  functorial  in X  and Y  (imagine  the  diagrams yourself ).  In  this  relationship,  F �  is 
the  left  adjoint  and  F�  is  the  right  adjoint. 
The notation was chosen because the adjoint pairs we will use correspond to operations of 
promotion  and  demotion  between  two  categories,  one  of  which  has more  structured  ob jects 
than  the  other.  Here  is  a  typical  example.  Let  F�  :  Ab  �  Set  be  the  forgetful  functor  on 
abelian  groups.  Let  F �  : Set � Ab  be  the  functor  carrying  a  set  S  to  the  free  abelian  group 
generated  by  S .  Then  F �  and  F�  form  an  adjoint  pair. 

6 

Another  important  example  for  us:  let  R  �  S  be  a  homomorphism  of  rings.  Let  F �  : 
ModR  � ModS  be  the  functor M  ⊗� M �R  S .  Let  F�  : ModS  � ModR  be  the  functor  given 
by  restriction  of  scalars  from  S  to R.  Then  F �  and  F�  form  an  adjoint  pair. 
We can of course compose F �  and F�  both ways,  and we don’t  in general get the  identity, 
or  even  something  naturally  isomorphic  to  the  identity.  We  do  get  something  interesting, 
though.  The  identity  map  on  F �X  corresponds  to  a  morphism  X  �  F�F �X ,  while  the 
identity  map  on  F�Y  corresponds  to  a morphism  F �F�Y  � Y .  These  morphisms  are  called 
adjunction  morphisms.  For  example,  in  the  previous  example,  for  X  an  R-module,  X  � 
F�F �X  =  X  �R  S  is  the  map  x  ⊗�  x � 1.  For  Y  an  S -module,  Y  �R  S  �  Y  is  the  map
