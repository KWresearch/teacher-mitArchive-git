Cohomology  of quasicoherent  sheaves (updated 25 Apr 09) 

There  is  one  more  fundamental  theorem  about  aﬃne  schemes!  Here  it  is. 

1  The  theorem,  and  a  bogus  proof 

Let’s  start  with  the  statement  of  the  fourth  fundamental  theorem  of  aﬃne  schemes. 

Theorem.  Let  X  be  an  aﬃne  scheme  and  let  F  be  a  quasicoherent  sheaf  on  X .  Then 
H i (X, F ) = 0  for  i >  0, that is,  F  is  acyclic  for  sheaf  cohomology. 

Here is how  not  to prove this theorem. 

Bogus  proof  of  the  theorem.  Put  X  =  Spec A.  From  the  earlier  fundamental  theorems  of 
aﬃne  schemes,  we  know  we  can  write  F  =  M˜ for  some  A-module  M .  Since  ModA  has 
enough  injectives,  we  can  ﬁnd  a  monomorphism  M  →  I  with  I  an injective  A-module.  Put 
N  =  I /M .  Again  by  the  earlier  fundamental  theorems  of  aﬃne  schemes,  we  know  that  the 
exact  sequence 

0  →  M  →  I  →  I /M  →  0 

of  A-modules  is  precisely  what  you  get  by  taking  global  sections  of  the  exact  sequence 

0  →  M˜ →  I˜ → 

˜ →  0.
I /M 

So  in  the  long  exact  sequence  in  cohomology,  the  connecting  homomorphism  into  H 1(X,  M˜ ) 
is  zero.  On  the  other  hand,  H i(X,  I˜) = 0 for all  i >  0  since  I˜ is  injective,  so  H 1(X,  M˜ ) is 
forced  to  be  zero.  Moreover,  for  i >  1,  H i(X,  M˜ )  ∼ H i−1(X, �
I /M ),  so  we  may  prove  the 
= 
higher  vanishing  by  dimension  shifting. 

What’s  wrong  with  this  proof ?  The  problem  is  that  while  the  injectivity  of  I  in ModA 
implies  the  injectivity  of  I  in  the  category  of  quasicoherent  OX -modules,  it  does  not  imply 
injectivity  in  the  category  of  arbitrary  OX -modules,  or  of  sheaves  of  abelian  groups  on  X . 
In particular, it is unclear  whether injectivity  of  I  implies that  I  is  ﬂasque.  One  can  at  least 
show that  I  is  “basically ﬂasque”, in that the restriction from Γ(X, I ) =  I  to Γ(D(f ), I ) =  If 
is  surjective,  but  this  isn’t  really  enough  to  do  anything  useful. 
There are two ways to  ﬁx this.  One way (used in Hartshorne, and  also in the book by 
Ueno that I  recommended  earlier) is to restrict  attention to noetherian rings, and  then prove 
that an injective module does indeed give rise to a  ﬂasque sheaf.  The other way (used in 
EGA)  is  to  compute  with  ˇCech  cohomology  instead  of  sheaf  cohomology,  so  that  you  can 
deal  only  with  ﬁnite  covers  by  distinguished  opens.  That’s  what  I’ll  do  here. 
First, however, I should  mention that there is an easy  argument to show that  H 1  vanishes. 
The  following  is  close  to  the  third  fundamental  theorem  of  aﬃne  schemes;  see  Hartshorne 
Proposition  II.5.6  for  the  proof. 
(Since  I  won’t  use  this  to  prove  the  theorem,  you  may 
instead  view  it  as  a  corollary  of  the  theorem.)

Lemma.  Let  X  = Spec A  be  an  aﬃne  scheme.  Let 

0  → F1  → F  → F2  →  0 

be an exact  sequence of  OX -modules such  that  F1  is quasicoherent (but don’t  assume anything 
about  the  other  two).  Then  the  sequence 

0  →  Γ(X, F1) →  Γ(X, F ) →  Γ(X, F2) →  0 

is  exact. 

This  implies  that  the  connecting  homomorphism  H 0(X, F2)  →  H 1(X, F1)  is  zero,  so 
H 1(X, F1) injects into H 1(X, F ).  If we then choose  F  to be injective, we deduce  H 1(X, F1 ) = 
0. 

2  Applications 

Before proving  the theorem, let  me mention  some corollaries.  First, from the  ˇCech  cohomol­
ogy  discussion,  we  deduce  the  following. 

Corollary.  Let  X  be  a  scheme  and  let  U =  {Ui}i∈I  be  an  open  cover  of  X .  Suppose  that  for 
each  ﬁnite  subset  J  ⊆  I , the intersection  UJ  =  ∩j∈J Uj  is  aﬃne.  Then  for  any  quasicoherent 
sheaf  F  on  X ,  the  sheaf  cohomology  of  F  is  computed  by  the  ˇCech  cohomology  for  the  cover 
U; that is, 

H i (X, F ) =  Hˇ i(U, F ). 

Recall  that  inside  a  separated  scheme,  the  intersection  of  any  two  open  aﬃnes  is  again 
aﬃne.  We  thus  have  the  following;  I’ll  illustrate  next  time  by  using  this  to  compute  the 
cohomology  of  the  sheaves  O(n) on  pro jective  space. 

Corollary.  Let  X  be  a  separated  scheme  and  let  U =  {Ui}i∈I  be  an  open  aﬃne  cover  of  X . 
Then  for  any  quasicoherent  sheaf  F  on  X , 

H i (X, F ) =  Hˇ i(U, F ). 

Here  is  an  even  more  specialized  corollary,  which  in  itself  is  not  so  useful.  I  mention  it 
because  I  will  prove  this  directly  and  use  it  as  a  lemma  to  prove  the  whole  theorem. 

Corollary.  Let  A  be  a  ring  and  choose  f1 , . . . , fn  ∈  A  which  generate  the  unit  ideal.  Let 
U  be  the  open  cover  of  X  = Spec A  by  D(fi )  for  i  = 1, . . . , n.  Then  for  any  A-module  M , 
Hˇ 0(U, M˜ ) =  M  and  Hˇ i (U, M˜ ) = 0  for  i >  0.

3  A  correct  proof  of  the  theorem 

Following Grothendieck (and I  think Serre before him, in  the  context  of  varieties),  we  will 
prove  the  last  corollary  ﬁrst,  and  then  use  that  to  prove  the  theorem.  So  our  ﬁrst  order  of 
business  is  to  show  that  the  complex 

0  →  M  →  Cˇ 0(U, M˜ ) →  Cˇ 1(U, M˜ ) →  · · · 

is  exact.  Remember  that  this  complex  came  from  the  complex  of  sheaves 

0  →  M˜ → Cˇ0 (U, M˜ ) → Cˇ1(U, M˜ ) →  · · · 

by  taking  global  sections.  We  proved  in  the  ˇCech  cohomology  lecture  that  this  sequence 
of  sheaves is  exact (by  computing  at stalks).  Moreover,  each  of the  constituent  sheaves is 
quasicoherent,  for  the  following  reason.  Each  sheaf  in  the  sequence  equals  a  direct  sum  of 
sheaves  each  of  the  form  jU ∗ (M˜ |U ) for  U  an  intersection  of  some  of  the  Uj .  In  particular, 
each  such  intersection  has  the  form  D(g )  for  some  g  ∈  A.  But  this  sheaf  is  simply  the 
quasicoherent  sheaf  associated  to  the  A-module  Mg . 
Since  we have  an exact  sequence  of quasicoherent  sheaves, taking global  sections gives us 
an  exact  sequence  of  A-modules.  This  proves  the  corollary.  So  now  we  know  that  for  any 
ﬁnite  cover  U  of Spec  A  by  distinguished  opens, 

Hˇ 0(U, M˜ ) =  M , 

Hˇ i (U, M˜ ) = 0 (i >  0). 

The same holds if we take the direct limit  over  ﬁnite covers by distinguished  opens.  However, 
this  gives  the  same  result  as  taking  the  direct  limit  over  al l  open  covers  because  any  cover 
can  be  reﬁned  to  a  ﬁnite  cover  by  distinguished  opens.  We  conclude  that 

Hˇ 0(X,  M˜ ) =  M , 

Hˇ i (X,  M˜ ) = 0 (i >  0); 

although  the  theorem  that  says  that  the  direct  limit  ˇCech  cohomology  also  computes  sheaf 
cohomology doesn’t  apply (because  X  is  not  Hausdorﬀ ),  one  can  still  show  that  this  implies 

H 0(X,  M˜ ) =  M , 

H i (X,  M˜ ) = 0 (i >  0) 

using  the  following  theorem  of  Cartan,  applied  with  B  being  the  collection  of  distinguished 
open  aﬃnes. 

Theorem  (Cartan).  Let  X  be  a  topological  space.  Let  B  be  a  basis  of  X  closed  under 
pairwise  intersections.  Let  F  be  a  sheaf  of  abelian  groups  on  X  such that  Hˇ i (U, F ) = 0  for 
al l  U  ∈  B .  Then  Hˇ i (X, F ) is  natural ly  isomorphic  to  H i (X, F ) for  al l  i  ≥  0. 

We  will  prove  this  in  the  next  section.  It  can  also  be  proved  using  spectral  sequences; 
see  the  optional  handout.

4  Comparison  of  ˇCech  and  sheaf  cohomology 

Before  proving  Cartan’s  theorem,  here  is  a  lemma  which  generalizes  a  fact  we  already  know 
about  ﬂasque  sheaves. 

Lemma.  Let  X  be  a  topological  space.  Let  F  be  a  sheaf  of  abelian  groups  on  X  such  that 
Hˇ 1(X, F ) = 0.  Then  for  any  short  exact  sequence 

of  sheaves, 

is  exact. 

0  → F  → G  → H  →  0 

0  →  Γ(X, F ) →  Γ(X, G ) →  Γ(X, H) →  0 

Proof.  (proof suggested  by  Fucheng  Tan)  We  need  only  check  surjectivity  on  the  right.  Let 
s  ∈  Γ(X, H) be  any  section;  let  U =  {Ui}i∈I  be  an  open  cover  of  X  such  that  for  each  i  ∈  I , 
s|Ui  lifts  to  a  section  ti  ∈  Γ(Ui , G ).  For  i, j  ∈  I , put 

uij  =  ti |Ui∩Uj  − tj |Ui∩Uj  ∈  Γ(Ui  ∩ Uj , G ). 

Since  uij  has  zero  image  in  Γ(Ui  ∩ Uj , G ),  we  may also  view  as  an  element  of  Γ(Ui  ∩ Uj , F ). 
With  this  convention,  we  see  that  the  uij  form  a  ˇCech  1-cocycle  of  F  for  the  open  cover  U. 
Before  proceeding,  note  that  there  is  a  natural  way  to  replace  the  above  data  for  one 
cover  U  with  a  reﬁnement  V =  {Vj }j∈J .  Namely,  the  reﬁnement  comes  by  deﬁnition  with  a 
map  λ  :  J  →  I  such that  Vj  ⊆  Uλ(j )  for  each  j .  To  pass  from  U  to  V: 

•	 replace  the  collection  of  the  ti  for  i  ∈  I  with  the  collection  of  the  tλ(j ) |Vj  for  j ∈  I ; 

•	 replace  the  collection  of  the  tij  for  i, j  ∈  I  with  the  collection  of  the  uλ(k)λ(l) |Vk ∩Vj  for 
k , l  ∈  I . 

To  avoid  excess  notation,  we  will  speak  of  “replacing  U  by  a  reﬁnement”  which  will  also  be 
labeled  U. 
Since  Hˇ 1(X, F ) = 0 by  hypothesis, we can replace  U  by  a  reﬁnement  in  such  a  way  that 
uij  become a  ˇ
Cech 1-coboundary.  This means that there are sections 
vi  ∈  Γ(Ui , F ) such  that 

vi |Ui∩Uj  − vj |Ui∩Uj  =  uij 

(i, j  ∈  I ). 

For  i  ∈  I ,  we  now  form 

wi  =  ti  − vi  ∈  Γ(Ui , G ). 

These  sections  have  the  property  that  on  one  hand,  the  image  of  wi  in Γ(Ui , H) equals  s|Ui 
(since vi ,  having  come  from  F ,  maps  to  zero  in  H),  and on  the  other  hand, 

wi |Ui∩Uj  − wj |Ui∩Uj  = (ti |Ui∩Uj  − vi |Ui∩Uj ) − (tj |Ui∩Uj  − vj |Ui∩Uj ) 
= (ti |Ui∩Uj  − tj |Ui∩Uj ) − (vi |Ui∩Uj  − vj |Ui∩Uj ) 
=  uij  − uij  = 0. 

Hence the  wi  glue  to  a  section  w  ∈  Γ(X, G ) lifting  s,  as  desired.

Proof  of  Cartan’s  theorem.  The  claim  is  true  for  i  =  0  because  of  the  sheaf  axiom.  We  use 
this  as  a  basis  for  induction  on  i,  using  dimension  shifting.  Assume  that  for  some  i >  0, the 
claim  is  true  for  every  value  less  than  i.  Choose  a  short  exact  sequence 

with  G  ﬂasque.  By  the  previous  lemma,  for  any  U  ∈  B , 

0  → F  → G  → H  →  0 

0  →  Γ(U, F ) →  Γ(U, G ) →  Γ(U, H) →  0 

is  exact.  Let  U =  {Ui}i∈I  be  an  open  cover  of  X  by  basic  open  sets.  Since  B  is  closed  under 
pairwise intersections, it follows that 

0  →  Cˇ . (U, F ) →  Cˇ . (U, G ) →  Cˇ . (U, H) →  0 

is  an  exact  sequence  of  complexes.  Since  every  open  cover  can  be  reﬁned  to  an  open  cover 
by  basic  opens,  taking  direct  limits  over  all  covers  is  the  same  as  taking  direct  limits  over 
basic  open  covers,  which  means  that 

0  →  Cˇ .(X, F ) →  Cˇ .(X, G ) →  Cˇ .(X, H) →  0 

is  again  an  exact  sequence  of  complexes.  The  same  holds  if  we  replace  X  by  any  basic  open 
set  U ,  by  the  same  reasoning. 
We  now  take  the  long  exact  sequence  in  cohomology  associated  to  this  short  exact  se­
quence  of  complexes,  and  compare  it  to  the  long  exact  sequence  in  sheaf  cohomology.  We 
get the diagram 

·  ·  · 

� ˇH i−1(X, G ) 

ˇH i−1(X, H) 

ˇH i(X, F ) 

ˇH i(X, G ) 

·  ·  · 

·  ·  · 

� H i−1(X, G ) 

� H i−1(X, H) 

� H i(X, F ) 

� H i(X, G ) 

� ·  ·  · 

We  ﬁrst  notice  that  Hˇ i (X, G ) =  H i (X, G )  =  0  because  G  is  ﬂasque. 
If  we  replace  X  by 
a  basic  open  set  U  and  then  look  at  the  top  sequence,  we  see  that  for  i >  1,  Hˇ i−1(U, H) 
is  sandwiched  between  two  zero  groups,  so  it  is  also  zero.  That  is,  H  also  satisﬁes  the 
hypothesis  of  the  theorem. 
We  may  now  argue  by  dimension  shifting  as  follows.  The  ﬁrst  vertical  arrow  is  an 
isomorphism (for  i  =  1  this  holds  by  the  sheaf  axiom,  otherwise  both  groups  vanish),  the 
second  vertical  arrows is an isomorphism by  the induction hypothesis,  and  the fourth  vertical 
arrow is the zero map between zero groups.  The  ﬁve lemma thus implies that the third  arrow 
is  an  isomorphism.
