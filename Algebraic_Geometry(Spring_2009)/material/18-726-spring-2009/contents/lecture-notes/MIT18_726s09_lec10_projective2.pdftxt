18.726:  Algebraic  Geometry  (K.S.  Kedlaya,  MIT,  Spring  2009) 
Pro jective  morphisms,  part  2  (updated  7  Mar  09) 

I  particularly  recommend  Eisenbud-Harris  for  the  material  in  this  section;  they  give  a 
complete  description  of  the  relationship  between  the  two  descriptions  of  a  blowup  (using 
charts  versus  relative  Pro j). 

1  Relative  Pro j 

Let X  be  a  scheme.  Let  S  = �� 
n=0Sn  be  a  graded  quasicoherent  OX -algebra.  For  each  open 
aﬃne  U  in  X ,  we  can  form  the  morphism  Pro j S (U )  �  U ;  these  glue  to  give  a  morphism 
Pro j S � X .  The  ob ject  Pro j S  is  called  the  relative  Proj  of  S . 
We  will  hereafter  assume  that  S1  is  ﬁnitely  generated  (remember  that  this  is  a  local 
notion), and  that S  is  (locally) generated by S1  as a S0 -algebra.  We also assume  that S0  is a 
quotient  of OX ; Hartshorne  assumes  that  in  fact  S0  = OX ,  but  I’d  rather  not  do  that.  Pick 
�(m+1)  � S1 |U ;  we  then  obtain  a  surjection 
an  open  aﬃne  subset  U  of X  and  a  surjection  OU 
�(m+1)  � S |U ,  where 
Sym OU 

�(m+1)  = �� 
�(m+1) . 
n=0 Symn OU 
Sym OU 

�(m+1) , and the latter is nothing 
This in turn gives a closed immersion Pro j S � Pro j Sym OU 
but  the  pro jective  space  Pn  Consequently,  Pro j S � X  is  locally  pro jective. 
U . 
We say that a morphism f  : Y  � X  is projective  if and only if it occurs as a relative Pro j. 
This  implies  locally  pro jective  and  is  implied  by  globally  pro jective,  but  does  not  coincide 
with  either. 
Following  EGA,  we  write  P(F )  for  Pro j Sym F  whenever  F  is  a  ﬁnitely  generated  qua­
sicoherent  OX -module. 

2  Very  ample  sheaves 

An  immersion  is  a  morphism  f  :  Y  �  X  of  schemes  which  on  topological  spaces  is  an 
isomorphism  of  Y  with  a  locally  closed  subset  (i.e.,  a  closed  subset  of  an  open  subset)  of X , 
such  that  for  each  y  ⊕  Y  mapping  to  x  ⊕  X ,  the  map  f �  :  OX,x  � OY ,y  is  surjective.  Any 
composition  of  closed  immersions  and  open  immersions  is  an  immersion;  conversely,  if  f  is 
an  immersion,  then  it  can  be  written  as  a  closed  immersion  followed  by  an  open  immersion. 
(Let  U  be  an  open  subset  of  X  in  which  Y  is  closed;  then  f  factors  uniquely  through  the 
open  immersion  U  � X ,  and  the  resulting  map  Y  �  U  satisﬁes  Hartshorne’s  deﬁnition  of 
a  closed  immersion.) 
Let f  : Y  � X  be a morphism.  A quasicoherent  sheaf F  on Y  is very  ample  relative  to f 
if there exists an immersion Y  � P(S1 ) for some ﬁnitely generated quasicoherent OX -module 
S1 ,  under  which  F  occurs  as  the  pullback  of O(1).  Unlike  the  deﬁnition  of  pro jectivity,  this 
notion  is  indeed  local  on  the  base.

Lemma.  The  morphism  f  : Y  � X  is  projective  if  and  only  if  f  is  proper  and  there  exists 
a  very  ample  sheaf  relative  to  f . 

Proof.  See  Hartshorne,  Remark  II.5.16.1. 

The  very  ample  sheaf  pulled  back  from  O(1)  can  be  used  to  retrieve  the  morphism  to 
P(S1 ).  Namely,  if S1  is globally ﬁnitely  generated,  any  set of generators pull back  to sections 
of  the  pullback  of  O(1),  and  those  deﬁne  a  morphism  to  pro jective  space.  See  Hartshorne 
Theorem  II.7.1. 

3  Blowups 

Here  is  a neat  class  of  examples  of  relative Pro j.  Let I  be  a ﬁnitely  generated  ideal  sheaf  on 
the  scheme  X ,  and  put  Y  = P(I ).  We  call  Y  the  blowup  of  X  along  I . 
For  example,  say  X  =  Spec k [x, y ]  for  k  a  ﬁeld,  and  let  I  be  the  ideal  sheaf  deﬁned  by 
�
(x, y ).  Over  U  = D(x) ∼ D(y ),  we  have  an  isomorphism  I |U  =  OU ,  so  Y  ×X  U  �  U  is  an 
isomorphism.  But  the  ﬁbre  over  the  origin  looks  like  a  pro jective  line  with  homogeneous 
coordinates  x, y . 
The  blowup  deﬁned  by  I  carries  less  information  than  I  itself.  For  instance,  for  any 
locally  principal  ideal  sheaf,  the  blowup  deﬁned  by  I  is  the  identity. 
Here is a special property of the blowup.  For f  : Y  � X  a morphism and I  an ideal sheaf 
on  X ,  we  may  compose  the  inclusion  I  � OX  with  f �  :  OX  �  f� (OY )  and  then  perform 
adjunction  to  get  f �I  � OY  .  The  image  is  an  ideal  sheaf  on  Y ,  called  the  inverse  image 
ideal  sheaf  of  I  under  f . 

Theorem  1.  If  f  :  Y  � X  is  the  blowup  deﬁned  by  the  ﬁnitely  generated  ideal  sheaf  I  on 
X ,  then  the  inverse  image  ideal  sheaf  of  I  on  Y  is  local ly  principal. 
Proof.  Recall  that  Y  =  Pro j S  for  Sn  =  Symn I .  In  this  notation,  the  inverse  image  ideal 
sheaf  of  I  on  Y  is  simply  OY (1),  which  is  locally  free.  This  proves  the  claim. 

In  fact,  f  is  universal  for  this  property:  any  morphism  Z  �  X  such  that  the  inverse 
image  ideal  sheaf  of  I  on  Z  is  locally  principal  factors  uniquely  through  f  (Hartshorne, 
Proposition  II.7.14). 
More  concrete  description  of  the  standard  example:  the  blowup  of  Spec k [x, y ]  at  (x, y ) 
is  covered  by  the  two  charts 

Spec k [x, y/x] 

Spec k [y , x/y ] 

glued  along  Spec k [x, y , x/y , y/x].  In  fact,  any  blowup  can  be  described  analogously:  the 
blowup  of Spec A  along I  = (r0 , . . . , rm )  is  covered  by m + 1  charts,  a  typical  one  of which  is 

Spec A[t1 , . . . , tm ](t1 r0  − r1 , . . . , tm r0  − rm ). 

The point is that the inverse image ideal sheaf is supposed to become locally principal, so you 
must  force  one  of  the  generators  r0 , . . . , rm  to  divide  into  the  other  ones,  and  the  diﬀerent

choices for which generator will divide into the others produces the diﬀerent charts.  (Explicit 
description  of  the  other  charts  and  the  glueing  is  left  to  the  reader.) 
A  blowup  is  a  special  example  of  a  modiﬁcation.  The  latter  is  a  morphism  f  :  Y  �  X 
of  schemes  which  is  proper,  surjective,  and  birational  (i.e.,  its  restriction  to  an  open  dense 
subset  of  X  is  an  isomorphism).  In  the  case  of  a  blowup  deﬁned  by  an  ideal  sheaf,  we 
get  an  isomorphism  over  the  complement  of  the  closed  set  deﬁned  by  the  ideal.  In  fact, 
under  certain  circumstances,  every modiﬁcation  can  be written  as  a blowup;  see Hartshorne 
Theorem II.7.17.  The catch is that the ideal sheaf  is not unique;  for example, on Spec k [x, y ], 
the  ideals  (x, y )  and  (x2 , xy , y 2)  deﬁne  the  same  blowup. 

4  Chow’s  lemma 

One use of modiﬁcations  is to turn proper schemes  (over  some base)  into pro jective  schemes. 

Theorem  2  (Chow’s  lemma).  Let  f  :  X  �  S  be  a  morphism  of  ﬁnite  type.  Assume  that 
either S  is noetherian, or S  is quasicompact and X  has ﬁnitely many  irreducible components. 
Then  there  exists  a  quasiprojective  S -scheme  X ∗  and  a  projective  surjective  morphism  f  : 
X ∗  � X  which  restricts  to  an  isomorphism  over  some  open U  → X  such  that  f −1 (U ) �= U  is 
dense  in  X ∗ .  Moreover,  if  X  is  reduced/irreducible/integral,  we  can  ensure  that  X ∗  is  also. 

See  EGA  2,  Lemme  5.6.1,  or  for  a  weaker  result,  Hartshorne  exercise  II.4.10.
