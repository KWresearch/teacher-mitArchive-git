More  properties  of  schemes  (updated  9  Mar  09) 

I’ve  now  spent  a  fair  bit  of  time  discussing  properties  of  morphisms  of  schemes.  How­
ever,  there  are  a  few  properties  of  individual  schemes  themselves  that merit  some  discussion 
(especially  for  those  of  you  interested  in  arithmetic  applications);  here  are  some  of  them. 

1  Reduced  schemes 

I  already  mentioned  the  notion  of  a  reduced  scheme.  An  aﬃne  scheme  X  =  Spec(A)  is 
reduced  if  A  is  a  reduced  ring  (i.e.,  A  has  no  nonzero  nilpotent  elements).  This  occurs  if 
and  only  if  each  stalk  Ap  is  reduced.  We  say  X  is  reduced  if  it  is  covered  by  reduced  aﬃne 
schemes. 

Lemma.  Let  X  be  a  scheme.  The  fol lowing  are  equivalent. 

(a)  X  is  reduced. 

(b)  For  every  open  aﬃne  subsheme  U  = Spec(R)  of  X ,  R  is  reduced. 

(c)  For  each  x ∩ X ,  OX,x  is  reduced. 

Proof.  A  previous  exercise. 

Recall  that  any  closed  subset  Z  of  a  scheme  X  supports  a  unique  reduced  closed  sub-
scheme,  deﬁned  by  the  ideal  sheaf  I  which  on  an  open  aﬃne  U  = Spec(A)  is  deﬁned  by  the 
intersection  of  the  prime  ideals  p ∩ Z ≥ U .  See  Hartshorne,  Example  3.2.6. 

2  Connected  schemes 

A nonempty  scheme  is connected  if its underlying  topological space  is connected,  i.e.,  cannot 
be  written  as  a  disjoint  union  of  two  open  sets.  (The  empty  scheme  is  not  connected.) 

Lemma.  The  scheme  X  is  connected  if  and  only  if  the  idempotent  elements  of  �(X, OX ) 
(i.e.,  the  solutions  of  e = e2 )  are  0  and  1. 

Proof.  If  X  is  a  disjoint  union  of  open  sets  U  and  V ,  then  we  can  construct  an  idempotent 
= 
0, 1  by  taking  the  pullback  of  0  along  U  �  Spec Z  and  the  pullback  of  1  along  V 
� 
e  ⊂
Spec Z.  Conversely,  if  e ∩ �(X, OX )  is  an  idempotent,  then  its  value  at  each  x ∩ X  is  either 
0  or  1;  the  sets  where  the  two  values  occur  are  closed  and  form  a  partition  of  X ,  so  X  is 
disconnected. 

In  many  reasonable  cases,  X  can  be  written  as  a  disjoint  union  of  connected  open  sub-
schemes;  these  are  then  called  the  connected  components  of X .

Irreducible  schemes 

A  nonempty  scheme  is  irreducible  if  its  underlying  topological  space  is  irreducible,  i.e.,  can­
not  be  written  as  a  union  of  two  proper  closed  subsets,  i.e.,  does  not  contain  two  disjoint 
nonempty  open subsets.  (The empty  scheme  is not  irreducible.)  Note that a nonempty  open 
subscheme  of  an  irreducible  scheme  is  still  irreducible. 

Lemma.  The nonempty aﬃne scheme X  = Spec(A) is irreducible if and only if the nilradical 
of  A  is  a  prime  ideal  (i.e.,  every  zero  divisor  of  A  is  nilpotent). 

Proof.  Note  that  X  is  irreducible  if  and  only  if  the  intersection  of  any  two  nonempty  open 
subsets  is  nonempty.  It  is  of  course  enough  to  check  the  intersection  of  two  distinguished 
opens  D(f ), D(g ).  They  are  nonempty  if  and  only  if  f  and  g  are  not  nilpotent;  the  inter­
section  D(f g )  is  nonempty  if  and  only  if  f g  is  not  nilpotent.  Hence  X  is  irreducible  if  and 
only  if  the  nilradical  of A  is  prime. 

Handy fact:  the spectrum of a local ring is irreducible, because the maximal ideal belongs 
to  every  closed  subset. 
A generic point  of a topological space is a point belonging to every nonempty open subset. 

Lemma.  If  X  is  irreducible,  then  X  has  a  unique  generic  point. 

Proof.  If  X  =  Spec(A),  then  the  nilradical  of  A  is  the  unique  generic  point.  In  general,  if 
X  is  irreducible  and U  = Spec(A)  is  a  nonempty  open  aﬃne,  then  any  generic  point  of X  is 
also  a generic  point of U .  Conversely,  if �  ∩ U  is  the unique  generic  point  of U  (which  exists 
because  U  is  forced  to  be  irreducible),  then  there  cannot  be  an  open  aﬃne  subset  V  of  X 
omitting  � ,  as  then  V  ≥ U  would  have  to be  empty  (since  it  is  an  open  subset  U  missing  the 
generic  point  of  U ),  a  contradiction.

Integral  schemes 

A  nonempty  scheme  is  integral  if  it  is  irreducible  and  reduced.  (The  empty  scheme  is  not 
irreducible.) 

Lemma.  Put  X  = Spec(A).  Then  the  fol lowing  are  equivalent. 

(a)  X  is  integral. 

(b)  A  is  an  integral  domain.  (The  zero  ring  is  not  an  integral  domain.) 

(c)  X  is  connected  and  each  local  ring  OX,x  is  an  integral  domain. 

Proof.  The  only  nontrivial  implication  is  (c) =→ (a).  Suppose  (c);  note  that  it  implies  that 
X  is  reduced.  Choose  f  ∩ A.  Let  U  be  the  set  of  x ∩ X  such  that  f  has  nonzero  image  in 
OX,x ;  then  U  is  open  (previously  assigned  exercise). 

2 

We  claim  that X \ U  is  also  open.  To  see  this,  pick  x ∩ X \ U  corresponding  to  a  prime 
ideal  p  of A.  Since  f  maps  to  zero  in Ap ,  there must  exist  g ∩ A \ p  for which  f g = 0.  That 
equality  in  turn  implies  that  D(g ),  which  contains  p,  is  in  fact  contained  in  X  \ U .  Since 
each  point  of X \ U  has  an  open  neighborhood  contained  in X \ U ,  we  conclude  that X \ U 
is  open. 
Since  X  is  connected,  it  follows  that  U  equals  either  X  or  the  empty  set.  In  the  latter 
case,  f  belongs  to  the  nilradical  of A,  and  so  equal  0  because  X  is  reduced. 
We  conclude  that  if  f , g ∩ A  are nonzero,  their  images  in  each Ap  are nonzero.  Hence  f g 
also  has  nonzero  image  in  each  Ap ,  and  so must  be  nonzero.  This  proves  (a). 

5  Normal  schemes 

A  scheme  X  is  normal  if  for  each  x  ∩  X ,  the  local  ring  OX,x  is  an  integral  domain  and  is 
integrally  closed  in  its  ﬁeld  of  fractions. 

Lemma.  Suppose  X  =  Spec(A)  is  connected.  Then  X  is  normal  if  and  only  if  A  is  an 
integral  domain  which  is  integral ly  closed  in  its  ﬁeld  of  fractions. 

Proof.  If A  is  an  integral domain which  is  integrally  closed  in  its ﬁeld  of  fractions,  then  so  is 
each localization of A (see Atiyah-Macdonald, Proposition 5.12), so X  is normal.  Conversely, 
suppose  X  is  connected  and  normal.  By  the  previous  lemma,  A  is  an  integral  domain. 
It  remains  to check  that an  integral domain  is  integrally closed  (in  its ﬁeld of  fractions)  if 
and  only  if  its  localization  at  each  prime  ideal  has  this  property.  This  follows  from  the  easy 
fact  that  A  is  the  intersection  of  the  A .p

The construction of the integral closure of a domain can be sheaﬁﬁed.  (Note:  a dominant 
morphism  is  one  with  dense  image.) 

Theorem  1.  Let  X  be  an  integral  scheme.  Then  the  category  of  dominant  morphisms 
X˜ � X  with  X˜ normal  has  a  ﬁnal  element. 

Proof.  Exercise. 

The  ﬁnal  element  is  called  the  normalization  of  X .  Under  “normal”  circumstances,  the 
morphism  X˜ � X  is  ﬁnite,  but  there  are  pathological  counterexamples  unless  one  imposes 
some  hypotheses. 
One  attempt  is  the  notion  of  a  Nagata  ring.  We  say  an  integral  domain  R  is  N-1  if  the 
integral  closure  of  R  in  Frac(R)  is  ﬁnite  as  an  R-module.  We  say  R  is  N-2  if  for  any  ﬁnite 
extension  L  of  Frac(R),  the  integral  closure  of  R  in  L  is  ﬁnite  as  an  R-module.  We  say  a 
general  ring  R  is  a  Nagata  ring  if  R  is  noetherian  and  R/p  is  N-2  for  any  prime  ideal  p  of 
R.  (Without  the  noetherian  hypothesis,  I  think  this  is what  is  called  a universal ly  Japanese 
ring  in  EGA.  My  deﬁnition  is  from  Matsumura,  Commutative  Algebra,  §31.)  The  point  is 
that  the  Nagata  property  is  stable  under  many  natural  operations:  localizations,  quotients, 
passing  to  a  ﬁnitely  generated  ring  extension,  certain  types  of  completion,  etc.

6  Dimension  and  codimension 

The  dimension  of  a  scheme  X  is  the  length  of  the  longest  chain  Z0  ⊗  Z1  ⊗  · · ·  ⊗  Zn  of 
distinct  irreducible  closed  subsets  of  X  (keeping  in  mind  that  the  numbering  starts  at  0). 
The  dimension  of  an  aﬃne  scheme  X  =  Spec(A)  is  the  same  as  the  Krul l  dimension,  since 
irreducible  closed  sets  of X  correspond  to  prime  ideals  of A. 
The  codimension  of an  irreducible  closed  subset Z  of X  is  the  length of the  longest chain 
Z0  ⊗  Z1  ⊗  · · · ⊗  Zn  of  distinct  irreducible  closed  subsets  of  X  for  which  Z0  =  Z .  We  can 
similarly  deﬁne  the  codimension  of  one  irreducible  closed  subset  inside  another. 
These  notions  can  behave  badly  even  for  the  spectrum  of  a  noetherian  ring  (Hartshorne, 
Caution 3.2.8).  Again, we need  to  impose more hypotheses  before working with  these  in any 
detail;  the  best  way  to  do  this  is  work  with  the  class  of  excel lent  schemes.  More  on  those 
later. 

7  Regular  schemes 

Let A be  a  local  ring with maximal  ideal m  and  residue  ﬁeld  k = A/m.  The  cotangent  space 
of A  is  the  k-vector  space  m/m 2 ;  its  dual  is  called  the  tangent  space  of  A. 
Suppose A is noetherian.  Then it is a nontrivial theorem from commutative algebra (e.g., 
Matsumura  §12)  that 

dimk (m/m 2 ) � dim A. 
If  equality  holds,  we  say  that  A  is  regular. 
We  say  that a  scheme X  is  regular  at a point x  if OX,x  is  a  regular  local  ring,  and  simply 
regular  if  it  is  regular  everywhere.  For  instance,  if  X  is  a  scheme  of  ﬁnite  type  over  a  ﬁeld 
k ,  then X  is  regular  if  and  only  if  the  corresponding  variety  is  nonsingular  everywhere.  For 
another  example,  Spec Z  and  Spec Z[x]  are  both  regular.  We  will  give  a  relative  version  of 
nonsingularity  later  (the  notion  of  a  smooth  morphism ). 

8  Excellent  rings  and  schemes 

A  quasiexcel lent  ring  is  a  noetherian  ring R  with  the  following  properties. 

(a)  For  any  prime  ideal  p  of  R  and  any  homomorphism  R  � K  with  K  a  ﬁeld,  the  ring 
Rˆ
p  �A  K  is  regular. 

(b)  Any  integral  domain A which  is  ﬁnite  as  an R-algebra  is  generical ly  regular,  i.e.,  there 
exists  a ∩ A  nonzero  such  that Aa  is  regular. 

An  excel lent  ring  is  a  quasiexcellent  ring  R  with  the  following  additional  property. 

(c)  The  ring	 R  is  universal ly  catenary.  That  is,  for  any  nonnegative  integer  n  and  any 
two  prime  ideals  p1  ⇒  p2  of  R[x1 , . . . , xn ],  any  two  maximal  chains  of  prime  ideals  of 
R[x1 , . . . , xn ]  starting  with  p1  and  p2  have  the  same  length.

The class of excellent  rings is introduced by Grothendieck  in EGA IV part 3 (see §7.8).  It 
includes some natural examples (ﬁelds, Z, complete local rings, and the series in C�x1 , . . . , xn � 
convergent  in  a  neighborhood  of  the  origin)  and  is  stable  under  nice  operations  (localiza­
tion,  completion,  quotient,  polynomial  ring).  These  rings  have  lots  of  useful  properties:  for 
instance,  they  are  Nagata  rings.
