Serre  duality  for  pro jective  space 

1  Ext  groups 

For  R  a  ring  and  M , N  ∈  ModR , I deﬁned Exti (M , N )  as  the  image  of  N  under  the  i-th 
right  derived  functor  of  HomR (M , ·).  This  makes  sense  because  HomR (M , ·) is  a  left  exact 
covariant functor from ModR  to Ab  (it  actually goes to ModR  but  never  mind  that).  I  also 
remarked  that  it  can  be  viewed  as  the  image  of  M  under  the  i-th  right  derived  functor  of 
HomR (·, N ),  provided we  view  this  as  a  functor  on  Modop 
R  . 
For  the  category  ModX  of  sheaves  of  OX -modules  on  a  ringed  space  X ,  we  can  imitate 
the  ﬁrst  construction  pretty  directly,  except  that  we  have  to  choose  between  the  normal 
Hom  and  the  sheaf  Hom.  Let  Exti (F , ·) be  the  right  derived  functors  of  Hom(F , ·),  and  let 
Ext i (F , ·) be  the  right  derived  functors  of  Hom (F , ·). 
For  example,  there  is  a  natural  isomorphism 

Exti (OX , F ) ∼ H i(X, F )
= 

because  these  are  derived  functors  of  the  naturally  isomorphic  functors  Hom(OX , F )  ∼= 
H 0(X, F ).  On  the  other  hand,  Hom (OX , F ) is  the  identity  functor,  so 

Ext 0(OX , F ) ∼ F , 
= 

Ext i (OX , F ) = 0 (i >  0).

Lemma.  Let  I  be  an  injective  OX -module.  Then  for  any  open  subset  U  of  X ,  I |U  is  an 
injective  OU -module. 

Proof.  Let  j :  U  →  X  be the inclusion.  We  must  show that given  a  monomorphism  F  → G , 
any  map  F  → I |U  extends  to  G .  Let  j∗  denote  extension  by  zero,  so  that  j∗F  has  the 
same  stalks  as  F  over  U  and  zero  stalks  elsewhere. 
(Sections  are  the  same  as  F  over 
opens  contained  in  U  and  zero  elsewhere.)  By  looking  at  stalks,  j∗F →  j∗G  is  still  a 
monomorphism.  Moreover,  we  have  a  map  j∗I |U  → I  by  adjunction,  and  the  resulting 
composition  j∗F →  j∗I |U  → I  extends to  j∗G  → I .  Restricting  back  to  U  gives the desired 
map  G  → I |U . 

Corollary.  For  any  open  subset  U  of  X ,  there  are  natural  isomorphisms 

∼
Ext i (F , G )|U  =  Ext i (F |U , G |U ). 

In  particular,  the  right  side  is  a  sheaf;  e.g.,  Ext i (F , G ) = 0  for  i >  0  whenever  F  is local ly 
free  of  ﬁnite  rank. 

Proof.  Both sides are cohomological functors in  G  whose higher terms vanish  on injectives (by 
the previous lemma in the case of  the right  side), hence are eﬀaceable and  thus universal.

Corollary.  For  I  an injective  OX -module, the functors 

Hom(·, I ), 

Hom (·, I ) 

are  exact. 

Proof.  This  is  true  for  Hom  by  the  deﬁnition  of  injectivity.  For  Hom ,  use  the  lemma. 

Proposition.  For  F  an  OX -module,  Exti (·, F ) and  Ext i (·, F ) are  cohomological functors on 
Modop 
X  . 

Proof.  Let  I ·  be  an  injective  resolution  of  F .  Given  a  short  exact  sequence 

0  → E  → G  → H  →  0 

in ModX , we obtain the long  exact  sequence by  taking Hom or  Hom  into  I ·  , yielding  a short 
exact  sequence  of  complexes  (by  the  previous  corollary),  and  then  taking  the  long  exact 
sequence  of  cohomology  groups.  One  does  need  to  check  independence  from  the  choice  of 
the  resolution, but this is  similar to  other  arguments  we’ve done before,  so I  won’t bore you 
with  it.  (The  summary:  by a  pushout  construction,  it  suﬃces  to  compare  I ·  and  J ·  when 
there  is  a  quasi-isomorphism  I ·  → J  ·  .  You  then  get  a  morphisms  of  short  exact  sequences 
which  is  a  quasi-isomorphism  on  each  term,  etc.) 

Unfortunately,  we  can’t  check  that  Exti (·, F ) and  Ext i (·, F ) are  eﬀaceable,  or  construct 
them  as  derived  functors,  because  ModX  need  not  have  enough  projectives  (exercise).  How­
ever,  we  can  still  use  certain  “acyclic  resolutions”  to  compute. 

Proposition.  Suppose that 

·  ·  ·  → L1  → L0  → F  →  0 

is  an  exact  sequence  in  ModX ,  where  each  Li  is  local ly  free  of  ﬁnite  rank.  (We  say  the  L· 
form  a  locally  free  resolution  of  F .)  Then  there  is  a  isomorphism 

Ext

i (F , G ) ∼
=  hi (Hom (L·  , G )) 

which is functorial both in  G  and  in  the  resolution  of  F . 

Proof.  Since  Li  is  locally  free  of  ﬁnite  rank,  Ext 1(I , ·) always  vanishes,  so  Hom (Li , ·) is  an 
exact functor (even though Hom(Li |U , ·) is  not exact  on  any  open  U ).  From  this  we  see  that 
the  right  side  is  a  cohomological  functor:  given  a  short  exact  sequence  0  → G1  → G  → G2  → 
0,  the  sequence 

0  →  Hom (L· , G1 ) →  Hom (L·  , G ) →  Hom (L·  , G2) →  0 

is  again  exact,  so  admits  a  long  exact  sequence  in  cohomology. 
We  now  have  that  both  sides  of  the  desired  isomorphism  are  cohomological  functors  in  G 
whose higher terms vanish  on injectives, so are eﬀaceable.  Hence they  are both  universal.

Note that locally free resolutions are much  easier to write down in practice than injective 
n  for  k  a  ﬁeld,  and  F  is  coherent,  then  Serre’s  theorem 
resolutions.  For  instance,  if  X  =  P
k
gives  a  surjection  E  → F  where  E  is  a  direct  sum  of  twisting  sheaves.  Repeated  application 
gives  not just  a locally  free  resolution but  a free  resolution! 

Proposition.  For any coherent  sheaves  F , G  on  Pn
k  for k  a  ﬁeld,  Ext i (F , G ) is again coherent. 

Proof.  We just  argued  that  a free resolution  L·  of  F  exists.  By  the previous proposition,  we 
need  only  check  that  the  hi (Hom (L· , G ))  are  coherent.  This  is  true  because  the  L·  and  G 
are  coherent,  so  the  Hom (L·  , G ) are  too. 

Lemma.  For  F , G , L ∈  ModX  with  L  local ly  free  of  ﬁnite  rank,  there  are  canonical  isomor­
phisms 

Exti (F ⊗ L, G ) ∼ Exti (F , L∨  ⊗ G )
= 

and 

Ext i (F ⊗ L, G ) ∼ Ext
= 

i (F , L∨  ⊗ G ) ∼ Ext
= 

i (F , G ) ⊗ L∨ 

. 

Proof.  Again,  check  that  everything  is  an  eﬀaceable  cohomological  functor  of  G  and  that 
things  match  at  i  = 0.  (See Hartshorne Proposition III.6.7.) 

Final  note:  you  may  be  wondering  what  the  relationship  is  between  Ext  and  Ext . 
It 
comes  from  the  following  general  fact:  if  F  and  G  are  left  exact  functors  such  that  F  ◦  G 
makes  sense,  then  there  is  a  spectral  sequence  relating  the  derived  functors  of  F , the derived 
functors  of  G,  and  the  derived  functors  of  F  ◦  G.  (See  Godement’s  book  for  details.)  In  our 
case,  given  a  sheaf  F , take 

F  =  H 0(X, ·), G  =  Hom X (F , ·), F  ◦  G  = HomX (F , ·). 

2  Duality  on  pro jective  space 

For  the  rest  of  this  lecture,  we  work  over  a  ﬁeld  k ,  but  it  need  not  be  algebraically  closed. 

Theorem  (Duality  on  pro jective  space).  Put  X  =  Pn
k .  Let  F  be  a  coherent  sheaf  on  X . 
Recal l that  H n(X, OX (−n  − 1))  is  one-dimensional  over  k . 

(a)  The  map 

HomX (F , OX (−n  − 1)) ×  H n(X, F ) →  H n(X, OX (−n  − 1)) 

is  a  perfect  pairing  of  ﬁnite  dimensional  k-vector  spaces (i.e., it identiﬁes each  space 
with  the  Hom  of  the  other  into  the  target). 

(b)  For  V  a  k-vector  space,  put 

V  ′  = Homk (V , H n (X, OX (−n  − 1)). 

3 

For  each  i  ≥  0,  there  is  a  natural  isomorphism 

Exti (F , OX (−n  − 1))  →  H n−i (X, F ) ′ 

which for  i  = 0  reproduces (a),  and  which is  compatible  with  short  exact  sequences. 

Proof.  For (a),  we have  a  natural  morphism 

Hom(F , OX (−n  − 1))  →  H n (X, F ) ′ 

of  left  exact  covariant  functors  on  Modop ,  which  we  claim  is  an  isomorphism.  In  case  F  = 
X 
OX (m),  we  want  a  natural  isomorphism 

H 0(X, OX (−m  − n  − 1))  ∼ Hom(H n(X, OX (m)), H n(X, OX (−n  − 1)))
= 

and  this  is  exactly  what  we  got  from  Serre’s  calculation.  Likewise,  we  already  have  the 
isomorphism  when  F  is  a  direct  sum  of  twisting  sheaves. 
In  general,  we  can  write  an  exact  sequence 

E1  → E0  → F  →  0 

in ModX  with  E0 , E1  both direct  sums of  twisting  sheaves.  Since the things we are computing 
are  left  exact  on  Modop ,  this  exact  sequence  turns  into  a  diagram  with  exact  rows:
X

0 

� 0 

Hom(F , OX (−n  − 1)) 

Hom(E0 , OX (−n  − 1)) 

Hom(E1 , OX (−n  − 1)) 

� H n(X, F )′ 

� H n(X, E0)′ 

� H n (X, E1)′ 

∼ 

∼ 

The  ﬁve  lemma  gives  the  desired  isomorphism. 
For (b),  we have two  cohomological functors  on the  category  of  coherent  OX -modules 
which  agree  at  index  0.  We  need  only  check  that  they  are  both  eﬀaceable.  For  this,  given 
F  coherent,  we  can  write  it  as  a  quotient  of  E  =  OX (−q)⊕m  for  any  suﬃciently  large  q .  So 
all  we  need  to  do  is  check  that  for  any  given  i >  0, both Exti (OX (−q), OX (−n  −  1))  and 
H n−i(X, OX (−q)) vanish  for  q  large.  The  second  statement  is  true  by  Serre’s  calculation;  so 
is  the  ﬁrst  because  Exti (OX (−q), OX (−n  − 1))  ∼=  H i (X, OX (q − n  − 1)). 

3  Diﬀerentials  and  duality 

This  is  not  really  the  right  way  to  view  the  duality  theorem,  because  it  does  not  generalize 
n ,  and  its 
well.  To  ﬁx  this,  we  reintroduce  the  sheaf  ΩX/k  of  K¨ahler  diﬀerentials  on  X  =  P
k
top  exterior  power  ωX , the  canonical  sheaf. 

Lemma.  For  X  =  P

n ,  the  sheaf  ωX  is isomorphic to  OX (−n  − 1).

Proof.  This  can  be  seen  using  the  exact  sequence 

0  →  ΩX/k  → OX (−1)⊕n+1  → OX  →  0 

of  sheaves on  X , where the middle term corresponds to the sheaf  ⊕n
i=0S (−1)ei , the right term 
corresponds  to  S  =  k [x0 , . . . , xn ],  and  the  map  S (−1)n+1  →  S  takes  ei  to  xi  (Hartshorne, 
Theorem  8.13).  This  gives  exact  sequences 

0  →  Ωi  → ∧i OX (−1)⊕n+1  →  Ωi−1  →  0
X/k 
X/k 
k

for all  i. For  i  =  n + 1, this becomes an isomorphism  OX (−n − 1)  →  Ωn  because Ωn+1  = 0. 
X/k 
X/k 
One  can  also see this more directly  by  writing  down  a global generator  of  ωX (n + 1).  For 
instance, deﬁne  α  ∈  H 0(D+ (x0  · · ·  xn ), ωX ) by  the formula 

α  = 

=

n+1 
x 
0 
d(x1/x0 ) ∧ · · ·  ∧ d(xn/x0 ) 
x0  · · ·  xn 
n
1  �(−1)i xidx0  ∧ · · · 
x0  · · ·  xn 
i=0 

∧  �
dxi  ∧ · · ·  ∧ dxn .

The  ﬁrst  line  shows  that  x0  · · ·  xnα  generates  ωX (n  +  1)  over  D+ (x0 );  it  also  shows  that 
performing  an  automorphism  of  X  which  swaps  two  of  x1 , . . . , xn  only  changes  α  by  a  sign. 
The  second  line  shows  that  the  same  is  true  of  the  automorphism  of  X  which  swaps  x0  and 
xn .  Hence  x0  · · ·  xnα  generates  ωX (n  + 1)  over  D+ (xi ) for  i  = 1, . . . , n. 

ˇ
Warning: Hartshorne Remark 7.1.1 claims that  α, viewed  as a  Cech n-cocycle, is invariant 
under  coordinate  changes.  However,  we  just  contradicted  this  by  showing  that  α  itself 
changes sign when you swap  two coordinates.  What is really happening is that if T  :  Pn
k  →  Pn
k 
is  the  linear  automorphism  deﬁned  by  the  matrix  A,  in  the  sense  that 
T ∗(xj ) =  � 
Aij xi 
i 

(i, j  = 0, . . . , n), 

then 

T ∗(x0  · · ·  xnα) = det(A)x0  · · ·  xnα. 

In any case, we can use  ωX  in place of OX (−n− 1) in the statement  of the duality  theorem 
on pro jective  space.  Next time, I’ll  talk  about how this  can be generalized  to  other  schemes 
over  k .
