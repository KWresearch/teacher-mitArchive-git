More  properties  of  morphisms  (updated  5  Mar  09) 

Note  that  ﬁnite  presentation  is  not  discussed  in  EGA  1;  see  EGA  4.1  instead. 

1  More  about  separated  morphisms 

Lemma.  The  composition  of  closed  immersions  is  a  closed  immersion. 
Proof.  Let  f  :  X  �  Y  and  g  :  Y  �  Z  be  closed  immersions.  Since  the  property  of  being 
a  closed  immersion  is  local  on  the  base,  we  may  assume  Z  =  Spec(A)  is  aﬃne.  Then 
Y  =  Spec(B )  for  B  a  quotient  of  A,  so  X  =  Spec(C )  for  C  a  quotient  of  B .  Hence  C  is 
a  quotient  of  A,  proving  the  claim.  (A  similar  argument  shows  that  a  composition  of  ﬁnite 
morphisms  is  ﬁnite.) 
Lemma. 
(a)  Any  closed  immersion  is  separated. 

(b)  A  composition  of  separated  morphisms  is  separated. 

(c)  Separatedness  is  stable  under  base  change. 

(d)  A  product  of  separated  morphisms  is  separated. 

(e)  If  f  :  X  �  Y  and  g  :  Y  �  Z  are  morphisms,  g � f  is  separated,  and  g  is  separated, 
then  f  is  separated. 

(f )  If  f  : X  � Y  is  separated,  then  fred  : Xred  � Yred  is  separated. 
Proof.  We know (a) because closed immersions are aﬃne and aﬃne morphisms are separated. 
We  know  (c)  from  the  previous  handout.  Parts  (d)-(f )  follow  once  we  also  have  (b);  see 
exercises. 
It  remains  to  prove  (b).  Let  f  : X  � Y  and  g  : Y  � Z  be  separated  morphisms.  Then 
X ×Y  X  maps  to X ×Z  X ;  in  fact,  this morphism  is  the base  change  of  the  closed  immersion 
� :  Y  �  Y  ×Z  Y  by  f  × f  : X ×Z  X  �  Y  ×Z  Y .  (To  check  this:  use  functor-of-points  to 
reduce  to  the  analogous  assertion  for  sets.  This  can  be  checked  with  Z  equal  to  a  singleton 
set,  so  we  just  want  to  know  that  for  a  morphism  of  sets  X  �  Y ,  the  ﬁbre  product  of  Y 
and  X  × X  over  Y  × Y  equals  X  ×Y  X .  This  is  obvious.)  Hence  X  ×Y  X  �  X  ×Z  X 
is  a  closed  immersion.  Since  the  composition  of  closed  immersions  is  a  closed  immersion 
(previous  lemma),  we  ﬁnd  that X  � X ×Y  X  � X ×Z  X  is  a  closed  immersion. 

2  Quasicompact  morphisms 

A morphism  f  : Y  � X  with X  aﬃne  is  quasicompact  if Y  is  quasicompact  as  a  topological 
space.  This deﬁnition satisﬁes  the strong collater (exercise),  so we get a notion which  is local 
on  the  base  and  stable  under  base  change. 
Exercise.  Any  aﬃne  morphism  is  quasicompact.

3  Finite  type  and  ﬁnite  presentation 

Let  A  be  a  ring.  Recall  that  an  A-algebra  B  is  ﬁnitely  generated  if  it  is  of  the  form 
A[x1 , . . . , xn ]/I  for some nonnegative  integer n and  some  ideal I  of A[x1 , . . . , xn ].  If I  can be 
chosen  to  be  a  ﬁnitely  generated  ideal,  we  say  that  B  is  ﬁnitely  presented ;  this  is  of  course 
automatic  if A  is  noetherian  (as  it  will  be  in most  of  our  examples). 
Let  f  : Y  � X  be  a morphism  of  schemes  with  X  = Spec(A)  aﬃne.  We  say  f  is  local ly 
of ﬁnite  type/presentation  if Y  is a union of open subschemes,  each of the form Spec(B ) with 
B  a  ﬁnitely  generated/presented  A-algebra.  If  only  ﬁnitely many  such  open  subschemes  are 
needed,  we  say  f  is  of  ﬁnite  type/presentation.  These  satisfy  the  strong  collater  (exercise). 
If f  : Y  � X  is of ﬁnite type, we  sometimes  say  that Y  is of ﬁnite type over X .  Similarly 
for  the  other  deﬁnitions. 
Obvious:  any  ﬁnite  morphism,  including  any  closed  immersion,  is  of  ﬁnite  type. 

Exercise.  A  morphism  f  :  Y  �  X  is  of  ﬁnite  type/presentation  if  and  only  if  it  is  quasi-
compact  and  local ly  of  ﬁnite  type/presentation. 

4  Algebraic  varieties 

We  can  now  give  a  scheme-theoretic  rendition  of  the  theory  of  abstract  algebraic  varieties, 
in  the  sense  of  18.725.  (But  see  below.) 
Let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld.  An aﬃne variety  is a locally ringed space deﬁned by 
some data of the  following form.  Pick a nonnegative  integer n and an ideal I  of k [x1 , . . . , xn ], 
and  put  X  =  V (I ).  Equip  X  with  the  Zariski  topology,  i.e.,  take  a  basis  of  open  sets  of 
the  form  D(g ) =  {x  �  X  :  g (x)  →
0}  for  g  �  k [x1 , . . . , xn ].  Deﬁne  a  regular  function 
= 
on 
an  open  subset  U  of  X  to  be  a  function  h  :  U  �  k  such  that  for  each  x  �  U ,  there  exist 
f , g  �  k [x1 , . . . , xn ]  and  a  nonnegative  integer  m  such  that  g  vanishes  nowhere  on  U  while 
gmh − f  vanishes  identically  on  U .  Then  the  regular  functions  on  U  form  a  sheaf. 
In  the  context  of  schemes,  we  interpret  X  to  be  the  set  of  maximal  ideals  in  Spec(A) 
for  A = (k [x1 , . . . , xn ]/I )red ,  equipped  with  the  structure  of  a  locally  ringed  space  given  by 
restriction  from  Spec(A). 
Now  recall  that  an  abstract  algebraic  variety  is  a  locally  ringed  space  covered  by  aﬃne 
varieties. 

Theorem  1.  The  category  of  abstract  algebraic  varieties  over  the  algebraical ly  closed  ﬁeld 
k  is  equivalent  to  the  category  of  schemes  which  are  reduced  and  local ly  of  ﬁnite  type  over 
Spec(k). 

Proof.  Exercise.  The  key  point  is  to  check  that  if  X  = Spec(A)  and  Y  = Spec(B )  for  A, B 
two  reduced  ﬁnitely  generated  k-algebras,  then  the  morphisms  from  X  to  Y  are  the  same 
as  the  morphisms  of  the  corresponding  algebraic  varieties.  But  that  is  because  they  both 
correspond  to  ring  homomorphisms  B � A.

Beware that there is no universal deﬁnition of algebraic varieties, because everyone  seems 
to  prefer  to  add  additional  hypotheses.  For  instance,  Hartshorne  (see  Chapter  I)  forces 
his  varieties  to  be  separated  (as  often  do  I).  Some  authors  also  force  their  varieties  to  be 
irreducible,  i.e.,  not  admitting  two  disjoint  open  subschemes.  And  so  on. 

5  Proper  morphisms 

We  would  like  to  have  an  algebraic  analogue  of  the  notion  of  a  compact  algebraic  variety 
over  the  complex  numbers.  For  this,  we  introduce  the  notion  of  properness. 
A  morphism  f  :  Y  �  X  of  schemes  is  proper  if  it  is  separated,  of  ﬁnite  type,  and 
universal ly  closed.  The  latter means  that any base change of f  is a closed map of topological 
spaces  (i.e.,  carries  closed  sets  to  closed  sets);  this  condition  comes  from  the  notion  of  a 
proper  map  of  topological  spaces  (see  exercises).  Since  these  properties  are  all  local  on  the 
base  and  stable  under  base  change  (the  last  one  by  ﬁat),  properness  is  also. 
The  deﬁnition  of  properness  is  rather  hard  to  check.  One  easy  case:  a  closed  immersion 
is  separated  (because  it’s  aﬃne),  of  ﬁnite  type  (obvious),  and  universally  closed  (because 
any  base  change  is  still  a  closed  immersion,  so  has  closed  image),  so  is  proper.  Besides  this 
example,  and  the  following  slightly  fancier  example... 

Exercise.  Any  ﬁnite  morphism  (including  any  closed  immersion)  is  proper. 

...  all  examples  of  properness  will  ultimately  be  extracted  from  the  following  theorem. 

Theorem  2.  The  morphism  f  : P
n 
Z  � Spec Z  is  proper.


Hartshorne  proves  this  using  the  valuative  criterion  for  properness  (under  a  somewhat 
mysterious  noetherian  hypothesis).  I’ll  ultimately  prove  this  following  EGA,  but  I  need  to 
wait  until  the  next  lecture  so  I  can  say  more  about  pro jective  spaces  in  the  interim.  I  will 
point  out  now  that  the  fact  that  f  is  of  ﬁnite  type  is  evident  from  the  glueing  construction, 
and  the  separatedness  may  be  obtained  by  describing  the  diagonal  �  :  P
n 
Z  ×Spec Z  Pn 
Z  �  P
n 
Z 
explicitly  (exercise). 
As  for  separated  morphisms,  we  have  some  properties. 

Lemma. 

(a)  Any  closed  immersion  is  proper. 

(b)  A  composition  of  proper  morphisms  is  proper. 

(c)  Properness  is  stable  under  base  change. 

(d)  A  product  of  proper  morphisms  is  proper. 

(e)  If  f  : X  � Y  and  g  : Y  � Z  are  morphisms,  g � f  is  proper,  and  g  is  separated,  then 
f  is  proper. 

(f )  If  f  : X  � Y  is  proper,  then  fred  : Xred  � Yred  is  proper.

Proof.  Again,  (d)-(f )  follow  from  (a)-(c).  We already  observed  (a) and  (c).  To check  (b), we 
already  checked  that  separatedness  composes.  Finite  type  composes  by  an  argument  similar 
to  the  proof  that  closed  immersions  compose.  Universal  closedness  composes  because  a 
composition  of  closed  maps  of  topological  spaces  is  again  closed. 

Corollary.  Any  morphism  f  : X  �  Y  that  factors  as  a  closed  immersion  of  X  into  P
n
Y  =

P
n 
Z  ×Spec Z  Y  fol lowed  by  the  projection  Pn
Y � Y  is  proper.


The  converse  is  not  true  even  over  C,  as  there  are  compact  algebraic  varieties  which  are 
not  closed  subvarieties  of  any  pro jective  space.  See  the  appendices  to  Hartshorne  for  an 
example.  One  can  often  deal  with  these  using  Chow’s  lemma,  about  which  more  later.
