Spectral  sequences  and  ˇCech  cohomology 

We explain the construction (or rather, one particular construction) of  spectral  sequences, 
enough  to  explain how they  are  used  as part  of  the  computation  of  the  sheaf  cohomology  of 
quasicoherent  sheaves  on  aﬃne  schemes  using  ˇCech  cohomology. 
I  continue  to  recommend  Bott  and  Tu,  Diﬀerential  Forms  in  Algebraic  Topology  as  a 
good  reference  for  spectral  sequences. 

1  Exact  couples 

It  is  handy  to  start  with  the  following  bit  of  homological  algebra.  An  exact  couple  is  a 
circular  exact  sequence

For  instance,  given  an  exact  sequence  0  →  A  →  A  →  B  →  0,  we  get  an  exact  couple  by 
taking  k = 0.  A  more  typical  example:  given  an  exact  sequence  of  complexes 

0  →  A·  →  A·  →  B ·  →  0, 

we  get  an  exact  couple  involving  the  total  cohomologies  ⊕ihi (A·  )  and  ⊕ihi (B ·  )  using  the 
long  exact  sequence  in  cohomology. 
From  an  exact  couple  we  obtain  a  derived  exact  couple

as follows. 

•	 Deﬁne  d  :  B  →  B  as  d =  j ◦  k .  Then  d ◦  d =  j ◦  k ◦  j ◦  k  = 0 because  k ◦  j  = 0,  so I 
can  deﬁne  the  cohomology  B ′  =  h(B ) = ker(d)/ im(d). 

•	 Put  A ′  = im(i). 

•	 We  now  have  an  obvious  map  i ′  :  A ′  →  A ′  induced by  i. 

•	 We  now  claim  that  there  is  a  well-deﬁned  map  j ′  :  A ′  →  B ′  sending  i(a) to  the  class 
of  j (a) for  any  a ∈  A.  To  make  sense  of  this,  we  ﬁrst  note  that  j (a) ∈  ker(d) because 
j ◦ k ◦ j  = 0.  We  next  note  that  if  i(a) = 0, then  a =  k(b) for some b ∈  B  by  exactness, 
so  j (a) =  k(j (b)) =  d(b).

•	 We  now  claim  there  is  a  well-deﬁned  map  k ′ 
:  B ′  →  A ′  induced  by  k .  That  is, 
if  b  ∈  ker(d),  k ′  should  carry  the  class  of  k ′  to  k(b);  this  belongs  to  im(a) because 
(j ◦  k)(b) = 0,  so  k(b) =  i(a) for  some  a ∈  A  by  exactness.  This  is  well-deﬁned: 

It  is  a  routine  exercise  in  diagram  chasing  to  verify  that  this  is  again  exact. 

2  Filtered  complexes  and  double  complexes 

Let  C ·  be  a  cohomologically  graded  complex  in  nonnegative  degrees.  A  ﬁltration  on  C ·  is  a 
decreasing  sequence  of  subcomplexes 

C = Fil0 C ⊇  Fil1 C ⊇  · · ·  . 
·
·
·

The  associated  graded  complex  is 

Gri C = Fili C ·/ Fili+1 C . 
·	
·

For  instance,  suppose  Dp,q  is  a  double  complex,  with  diﬀererentials  d· 
p  in the  p-direction 
and  d· 
q  in the  q -direction.  We  form  a  single  complex 
 

C k  �
= 
p+q=k 

Dp,q 

with derivation  dp  + (−1)pdq .  (The  alternating sign  is  needed  to  ensure  that  this  is  actually 
a  complex.)  We  then  obtain  a  ﬁltration  on  C ·  by  setting 
 

Fili C k  =  �
Dp,q 
. 
p+q=k ,p≥i 

3  The  spectral  sequence  of  a  ﬁltered  complex 

Given  a  ﬁltered  complex  C · ,  there  are  two  interesting  invariants  one  can  consider.  Perhaps 
the  most  natural  one  is  the  cohomology  h·  (C ·  ),  equipped with  the  decreasing  ﬁltration 

Fili h ·  (C ·  ) = im(h ·  (Fili C · )). 

However,  in  practice  this  will  usually  be  something  complicated.  A  less  complicated  in­
variant  will  be  the  cohomology  of  the  graded  complex  h·  (Grp C ·  ).  This  is  a  rather  crude 
approximation  to  the  cohomology  of  the  total  complex;  it  turns  out  that  there  is  a  sequence 
of  reﬁnements  that  give  closer  and  closer  approximations.  These  constitute  the  spectral 
sequence  associated  to  the  ﬁltered  complex. 
To  start  with,  take  the  exact  sequence  of  complexes

with  the  square-zero  endomorphisms  dh  =  jh  ◦  kh .  Note  that  Eh+1  is just  the  cohomology

(The  terms 
in this sequence are often called the  sheets
, or  pages
, of the spectral sequence.  The visual 
signiﬁcance  of  these  metaphors  may  become  more  clear  in  the  next  section.) 
Without  any  additional hypotheses, the spectral  sequence does not  say  much.  But  under 
certain  circumstances,  the  Eh  “converge”  to  something  useful.  Namely,  suppose  that  the 
complex  C ·  comes  not  only  with  a  ﬁltration  but  with  a  grading  C ·  =  ⊕q Cq 
·  . 

·  has  only  ﬁnitely  many 
Theorem.  Suppose  that  for  each  q ,  the  induced  ﬁltration  on  Cq 
distinct  steps.  Then  the  spectral  sequence  converges,  in  the  sense  that  for  each  q ,  the  q ­
th graded piece of  E stabilizes for  h  large. 
If we let  E denote the sum of the stable
h 
∞ 
graded pieces, then  E is canonical ly isomorphic to the associated graded group  of  the ﬁltered
∞ 
cohomology  Fili h·  (C ·  ). 

Note that we still don’t quite manage to compute the ﬁltered  cohomology, but but only 
its graded pieces.  Still, that information itself is often very 
useful.  (It is sometimes said 
very 
that the spectral 
sequence 
abuts  to the ﬁltered  cohomology.) 

Proof.  See  Bott  and  Tu,  Theorem  14.6. 

4  The  spectral  sequence  of  a  double  complex 

Let us see how this works in the speciﬁc  example  of  a double complex.  (I’m just going to 
state  the  result;  see  Bott  and  Tu  for  the  derivation.)  Let  Dp,q  be  a  double  complex,  and 
let  C ·  be  the  associated  ﬁltered  single  complex. 
It  is  customary  to  draw  pictures  in  this

Taking  cohomology  here  gives  you  exactly  E1 .  A  quick  diagram  chase  shows  that  the  next 
diﬀerential  is  precisely  the  one  induced  by  dp :

Taking  cohomology  gives  the  next  sheet  E2 .  But  what  is  the  next  diﬀerential?  Again,  I’ll 
just  state  the  answer.  Each  element  of  E2  is  represented  by  an  element  of  b  for  which  for 
some  c, 

dq (b) = 0,

dp (b) = (−1)p+1dq (c).

and  we  can  explicitly  see  the  stabilization,  since  we  get  an  increasingly  large  bottom  left

5  Spectral  sequences  and  ˇCech  cohomology 
Here  is  how  spectral  sequences  make  quick  work  of  the  comparison  theorem  between  ˇCech 
and  sheaf  cohomology,  in  the  form  needed  for  algebraic  geometry.  Let  X  be  a  topological 
space,  and  let  F  be  a  sheaf  of  abelian  groups  on  X .  Let  I ·  be  a  ﬂasque  resolution  of  F . 
Take  the  double  complex 

Dp,q  =  Cˇ p (X, I q ) = lim Cˇ p(U, I q ).

The  trick  here  is  that  there  are  two  diﬀerent  ways  to  run  the  spectral  sequence  construction 
from a double complex, depending  on how you orient the diagram.  As written, we  ﬁrst take 
ˇCech  cohomology,  and  then  take  cohomology  of  whatever  that  yields: 

E p,q  =  Hˇ p (X, I q )
1a 
E p,q  =  hq (Hˇ p(X, I  ·  )).
2a 

Note that  E p,q  = 
0 for  p > 0 because the  ˇ
Cech  cohomology  of  a ﬂasque sheaf is zero, whereas 
1a 
E p,0  = Γ(X, F ).  Thus  E p,q  = 0 for  p > 0,  and  in  fact  E p,q  =  E p,q  for  all  p, q .  Since  we  only 
1a 
2a 
2a 
∞a 
have  one  term  along  each  antidiagonal,  we  actually  get  much  more  than  usual:  we  really 
,q  =  H q (X, F ). 
0
have  computed  the  cohomology  of  the  total  complex,  and  it  is  the  E2
a
Now  let’s  run  the  spectral  sequence  with  the  roles  of  p  and  q  reversed.  This  time,  I  take 
cohomology  in the  q -direction  ﬁrst,  so  I  start  with 

E q ,p  =  hq (Cˇ p (X, I  ·  )).
1b 

This  is  a  rather  strange  ob ject,  but  we  can  repackage  it  in  a  useful  way  by  noting  that  the 
functor  I →  Cˇ p (X, I ) preserves  exact  sequences  of  presheaves,  i.e.,  sequences  of  presheaves 
where  the  sections  over  any  open  give  an  exact  sequence.  That  means  that  working  with 
presheaves,  I  can  commute  the  cohomology  computation  across  the  Cˇ p .  I’ll  take  advantage 
of  this by  deﬁning  the presheaf  Hq  by 

so that 

Hq (U ) =  H q (I  ·  (U )) =  H q (U, F ), 

E q ,p  =  Cˇ p (X, Hq )
1b 
E q ,p  =  Hˇ p(X, Hq )
2b 

interpreted  as  the  ˇCech  complex  associated  to a presheaf (deﬁned  using  the same formula  as 
for  sheaves).  This  spectral  sequence  must  converge  to  some  term  E q ,p  giving graded pieces 
∞b 
of  the  total  cohomology,  which  we  already  identiﬁed  as  the  sheaf  cohomology  of  F  itself. 
This  isn’t  useful  as  an  abstract  method  for  dealing  with  ˇCech  cohomology.  However, 
it  is  just  the  thing  I  need  to  prove  the  theorem  that  I  need  to  ﬁnish  the  argument  that 
quasicoherent  sheaves  on  aﬃne  schemes  are  acyclic. 

Theorem.  Let  X  be  a  topological  space  equipped  with  a  nice  basis  B  (i.e.,  a  basis  closed 
under  pairwise  intersections;  we  need  not  assume  X  ∈  B ).  Let  F  be  a  sheaf  of  abelian 
groups  on  X  such  that  Hˇ i(U, F ) = 0  for  al l  i >  0  and  al l  U  ∈  B .  Then  there  are  natural 
isomorphisms  Hˇ i (X, F ) →  H i (X, F ) for  al l  i ≥  0. 

Proof.  The  natural  maps  come  from  the  fact  that  if  I ·  is  an  injective  resolution  of  F , then 
the  ˇ
Cech  resolution  ˇ·  (X, F )  admits  a  map  into  I
·
which  is  a  quasi-isomorphism,  and  is 
C
well-determined  up  to  a  chain  homotopy.  (This  is  similar  to  the  homework  problem  about 
injective  resolutions  of  complexes;  see  PS  8,  problem  7.) 

6 

To prove the theorem, it  suﬃces to check for  X  equal  to an open in  B ,  as  then  the  Leray 
theorem  asserts  that  we  can  compute  sheaf  cohomology  using  any  cover  by  elements  of  B , 
and  any  open  cover  reﬁnes  to  such.  So  assume  hereafter  X  ∈  B . 
We  induct  on  i,  the  case  i  =  0  being  an  easy  consequence  of  the  sheaf  axiom.  Say  we 
know that 

(0 < j  < i, U  ∈  B ). 
H j (U, F ) = 0 
Then  the  spectral  sequence  E·b  from  above  has  E q ,p  = 0 for 0  < q < i.  By  staring  at  the 
2b 
spectral  sequence,  we  see  that  the  terms  with  q +  p =  i must  already  be  stable,  so  the  total 
i-th  cohomology  must just be 

,i  =  Hˇ i (X, H0 ) =  Hˇ i(X, F ).

E2
b

Since  we  also  know  that  the  total  cohomology  is  H i(X, F ),  we  obtain  the  desired  isomor­
phism.
