18.726:  Algebraic Geometry (K.S. Kedlaya, MIT, Spring 2009) 
GAGA (updated 30 Apr 2009) 

We  now  discuss  a  classic  theorem  of  algebraic  geometry,  Serre’s  GAGA,  which  exposes 
a  tight  relationship  between  algebraic  geometry  over  the  complex  numbers  and  complex 
analytic  geometry.  By  far  the  best  reference  for  this  is  Serre’s  original  paper  G´eom´etrie 
alg´ebrique  et  g´eom´etrie  analytique. 
(Thanks  to  Bjorn  Poonen  for  reporting  some  errors, 
which  have  now  been  corrected.) 

1  Coherent  sheaves 

In  order to discuss GAGA, I  need to talk  about  coherent  sheaves  not just  on  schemes, but 
on  analytic  spaces.  In  fact,  the  notion  is  well-deﬁned  on  any  locally  ringed  space. 
Let (X, OX )  be  a  locally  ringed  space.  We  say  a  sheaf  F  is  coherent  if  F  is  ﬁnitely 
generated,  and  for  any  open  subset  U  of  X ,  any  nonnegative  integer  n,  and  any  homomor­
phism  h  :  O⊕n |U  → F |U ,  the  kernel  of  h  is  itself  ﬁnitely  generated.  Warning!  I  originally 
X 
only  required  this  for  h  surjective,  but  I  don’t  think  that  is  enough.  (Important  note:  we 
don’t  require  the  kernel  to  be  generated  by  ﬁnitely  many  sections  over  all  of  U .)  This  is 
stronger  than  saying  that  F  is  ﬁnitely  presented,  in  which  case  we  only  require  that  one 
such  surjection  h  must  have  this  property.  In  particular,  OX  itself  need  not  be  coherent. 
However, if  X  is locally  noetherian, then all  ﬁnitely generated quasicoherent sheaves are 
in  fact  coherent.  This  follows  from  the  following  result. 

Theorem.  Let  A  be  a  noetherian  ring, put  X  = Spec A, let  V  be  an  open  subset  of  X ,  and 
let  F  be  an  OX |V -module.  Then  the  fol lowing  are  equivalent. 

(a)  F  is  coherent. 

(b)  F  is  ﬁnitely  generated  and  quasicoherent. 

(c)  We  have  F  =  M˜ for  some  ﬁnitely  generated  A-module  M . 

I’m  only  going  to  show  this  for  V  =  X ,  as  this  is  the  only  case  I  need.  For  the  general 
case,  see  EGA  1,  Th´eor`eme  1.5.1. 

Proof.  Even  without  a  noetherian  hypothesis,  it  is  obvious  that  (a)  implies  (b),  and  we 
checked (b)  implies (c)  in  a previous lecture. 
To  check  that  (c)  implies  (a)  under  the  noetherian  hypothesis,  note  that  the  claim  is 
local,  so  it  suﬃces  to  check  that  the  kernel  of  a  homomorphism  O⊕n |D(f )  →  F |D(f )  is 
X 
ﬁnitely generated.  It is represented by  a homomorphism  An
f  →  Mf  of  Af -modules, but  Af  is 
noetherian since  A is.  Hence the kernel of the homomorphism, being  a submodule of  a  ﬁnitely 
generated  Af -module, is itself  a  ﬁnitely generated  Af -module (because  A  is noetherian).

Lemma.  Let 

0  → F1  → F  → F2  →  0 

be  a  short  exact  sequence  of  quasicoherent  sheaves  on  a  local ly  ringed  space  X .  Then  if  any 
two  of  F , F1 , F2  are  coherent,  so  is  the  third. 

Proof.  Exercise. 

Beware that it is not  obvious that the inverse image of  a coherent  sheaf is coherent,  since 
the  deﬁning  condition  involves  looking  at  all  open  subsets. 

2  Analytiﬁcation  of  coherent  sheaves 

In  order  to  state  the  GAGA  theorems,  we  use  the  fact  that  there  is  a  morphism  of  locally 
ringed  spaces 

:  P˜ r 
rP→ C
h

,

C 
where  the  left  side  is  the  pro jective  r-space  over  C  viewed  as  a  complex  manifold  (or  a 
complex  analytic  variety,  on  which  more  later).  Where  does  this  morphism  come  from? 
We’ll  give  a  functorial  answer  later,  but  for  now  I’ll  do  something  more  direct. 
r⊆  P
For  each  i  = 0, . . . , r , put  Xi  =  D+ (xi ) 
This  space  is  an  aﬃne  n-space  over  C
.

C
let  ˜
Xi  be the complex analytic aﬃne  r-space with  the same

i; 
coordinates.  There  is  an  obvious  map 

Γ(Xi , OXi ) =  C[x0/xi , . . . , xr /xi ] →  Γ( X˜ i , OX˜ i ); 

by  adjunction,  this  gives  us  a  morphism 

X˜ i  →  Xi 

of locally  ringed  spaces.  These glue to give the morphism I described.  Note that  P˜ r  includes 
C
r
only  some of the points of  P
(namely  the  closed  points),  but  gives  them  a  ﬁner  topology 
C
(the  analytic  topology  rather  than  the  Zariski  topology).  This  is  consistent  with  the  fact 
that  the  map  P˜ r 
rP→ C
is  continuous. 
C
What  is  nice  about  viewing  the  analytiﬁcation  process  this  way  is  that  we  can  apply 
operations  deﬁned  on  locally  ringed  spaces  uniformly  to  both  P˜ r 
rPto 
.  For  instance,  for

,  h∗F  is  coherent. 

Proof.  Recall  that  there  exists  a  surjection  O(n)⊕m  → F  for  some  integers  m, n.  It  thus 
suﬃces  to  show  that  h∗O(n) is  coherent.  Since  coherence is  a local property, it is  enough  to 
show  that  the  structure  sheaf  on  complex  analytic  aﬃne  n-space is  coherent (as  a  module 
over  itself ).  This  follows  from  the  fact  that  each  local  ring  of  this  space  is  noetherian. 
I won’t give a complete proof  of this here, but the basic idea is as follows.  Let C{x1 , . . . , xr } 
be the ring  of formal power  series  which  converge in some neighborhood  of  the origin;  this is 

2


the  ring  we  are trying  to prove is  noetherian.  We proceed by  induction  on  r ,  the  case  r  = 0 
being trivial.  The key to the induction step is the Weierstrass preparation theorem, which im­
plies that any  element  of  C{x1 , . . . , xr } equals a unit times an element  of  C{x1 , . . . , xr−1}[xr ]. 
Since  that  ring  is  noetherian  by  the  induction  hypothesis  plus  the  Hilbert  basis  theorem,  we 
deduce that  C{x1 , . . . , xr } is too.  For a proof  of  the Weierstrass preparation theorem,  see for 
example  the  ﬁrst  few  pages  of  Griﬃths  and  Harris,  Principles  of  Algebraic  Geometry. 

We  also  need  the  following  relationship  between  analytic  and  algebraic  stalks. 

Lemma.  For  any

phism  g  :  OP˜r 
C ,z  →  C�t1 , . . . , tn �.  Both  g  and  g ◦  f  are  faithfully  ﬂat  because  they  are  maps 
from noetherian local  rings into their completions for their maximal ideals.  This easily yields 
ﬂatness  of  f . 

Corollary.  The functor  h∗

,  the  natural  morphism 

CH i (Pr  , F ) →  H i(P˜ r  , h∗F )

is  an  isomorphism  for  each  i  ≥  0. 

In order to prove this, we need  a mechanism for computing  sheaf  cohomology  on analytic 
spaces.  Here  it  is,  presented  as  a  black  box. 

Theorem  (Cartan).  For  any  nonempty  subset  J  of  {0, . . . , r} and  any  coherent  sheaf  F  on 
U  =  ∩j∈J X˜ j ,  H i (U, F ) = 0  for  i >  0. 

The  key  point  is  that  U  is  a  Stein  manifold.  This  also  holds  if  U  is  the  analytiﬁcation 
of  any  aﬃne  scheme  of  ﬁnite  type  over  C  (which  I’ll  leave  to  you  to  deﬁne).  By  Leray’s 
theorem,  this  gives  the  following  corollary.

Corollary.  For  any  coherent  sheaf  F  on  P˜ r 
C ,  we  may  compute  sheaf  cohomology  using  the 
ˇCech  complex  associated  to  the  cover  U  =  {X0 , . . . , Xr }.  In  particular,  the  i-th  cohomology 
vanishes for  i > r . 

With  this,  the  proof  is  parallel  to  that  of  Serre’s  ﬁniteness  theorem.

(By the way, this makes it clear that the theorem is completely false if  we replace  P

More on this later.)
We  next  deal  with  the  cases  F  =  O(n) for  n  ∈  Z,  using  the  exact  sequence 

×xr
0  → O(n  − 1)  → O(n) → OH (n) →  0 

for  H  ∼=  Pr−1 
the hyperplane  xr  = 0.  By induction on  r , and  comparing long  exact  sequences 
C
in  cohomology,  we  can  infer  all  of  the  cases  from  the  case  n  = 0. 
Finally,  we treat the general  case by descending  induction  on  i  (as in the proof that  ˇCech 
cohomology  for  a  good  cover  computes  sheaf  cohomology).  Build  an  exact  sequence 

0  → G  → E  → F  →  0 

in  which  E  is  a  direct  sum  of  twisting  sheaves.  Note  that  applying  h∗  is  exact,  so  we  get 
an  exact  sequence  on  the  analytic  side.  Then  twist  and  compare  long  exact  sequences  in 
cohomology  after  twisting:

Using  the  ﬁve  lemma,  we  get  the  desired  result. 

4  The  second  GAGA  theorem 

We  now  know  that  algebraic  coherent  sheaves  preserve  their  cohomology  under  pullback  to 
the  analytic  side.  We  next  show  that  they  also  preserve  their  morphisms. 

Theorem  (GAGA, part 2). 

Let  F G  be coherent sheaves on  P

Proof.  In  general,  for  sheaves  of  OX -modules  F  and  G , let  H om (F , G ) be the presheaf 

H om (F , G )(U ) = HomOU (F |U , GU ). 

Its  global  sections  are  just 
This  is  in  fact  a  sheaf,  called  the  sheaf  Hom  from  F  to  G . 
HomOX (F , G ).  (I should  really  write  H om OX (F , G ) with  the  subscript  OX ,  but  never  mind 
for  now.) 
Note  that  there  is  a  natural  map 

h∗ H  om (F , G ) →  H om (h∗F , h∗G ) 

of  sheaves  on  P˜ r  ,  given  by  viewing  an  algebraic  morphism  over  a  Zariski  open  subset  of 
C
as  an  analytic  morphism  over  the  corresponding  subset  of  P˜ r 
Pr 
.  We  claim  this  map  is  an 
C
C
isomorphism;  this will imply  the theorem by  taking global  sections of  this isomorphism, then 
applying  the  ﬁrst  GAGA  theorem. 
We  check  the  isomorphism  on  stalks.  Using  coherence,  we  have  for  each  z  ∈  P˜ r  a natural 
C
identiﬁcation 

H om (F , G )z  = Hom(Fz , Gz ) 
and  similarly  on  the  analytic  side.  Put 

R  =  OPr ,z ,
C

R˜ =


O˜
rP
C

;,z

a  lemma  from  earlier  states  that  R˜ is  ﬂat  over  R.  By  that  ﬂatness  plus  the  lemma  below 
(and the fact that  R  is  noetherian),  we  have  a  natural  identiﬁcation 

˜
˜
˜
Hom(Fz , Gz ) ⊗R  R  = Hom(Fz  ⊗R  R, Gz  ⊗R  R). 

This  yields  the  claim. 

Lemma.  Let  R  be  a  noetherian  ring.  Let  S  be  a  ﬂat  R-algebra.  Then  for  any  R-modules 
M , N ,  the  natural  map 

HomR (M , N ) ⊗R  S  →  HomS (M  ⊗R  S, N  ⊗R  S ) 

is  a  bijection. 

Proof.  Since  R  is  noetherian,  I  can  ﬁnd  an  exact  sequence 

F1  →  F0  →  M  →  0 

where  F0 , F1  are  ﬁnite  free  R-modules.  Then  we  get  a  diagram

� HomS (F0  ⊗R  S, N  ⊗R  S ) 

� HomS (M  ⊗R  S, N  ⊗R  S ) 

with  exact rows (the exactness in the  ﬁrst row requiring  the  ﬂatness of  S  over  R).  Since the 
second  and  third  vertical  arrows  are  isomorphisms,  so  is  the  ﬁrst  by  the  ﬁve  lemma.

5  The  third  GAGA  theorem 

We  next  try  to  classify  the  coherent  sheaves  on  the  analytic  pro jective  space.  We  need  one 
more black box.

Sketch  of  proof.  Equip  the  ˇCech  cocycles  for  the  usual  open  cover  with  the  topology  of 
uniform  convergence  on  compact  subsets.  Then  restrict  to  a  cover  in  which  each  X˜ i  is 
replaced  by  an  open  subset  with  closure  inside  X˜ i .  Using  this,  one  sees  that  for  the  induced 
topology  on  H i(P˜ r  , F ),  the  identity  map  is  compact,  which  is  only  possible  if  this  vector

then  have  the  usual  exact  sequence

of  algebraic  coherent  sheaves.  Tensoring  with  F ,  we  have  an  exact  sequence 

F (−1)  → F  → FE  →  0 

where  FE  denotes  the  pushforward  of  the  restriction  to  E .  Let  G  be  the  kernel  on  the  left 
side.  Twisting,  we  get 

0  → G (n) → F (n  − 1)  → F (n) → FE (n) →  0. 

Split  this  into  short  exact  sequences: 

0  → G (n) → F (n  − 1)  → H  →  0 
0  → H  → F (n) → FE (n) →  0

and  then  take  long  exact  sequences  in  cohomology: 

C , H) →  H 2(P˜ r 
C , F (n  − 1))  →  H 1(P˜ r 
H 1(P˜ r

H 1(P˜ r  →  H 1( ˜
→  H 1( ˜
Pr 
Pr 
C , F (n))
C , H)
C , FE (n)). 

Note  that  G  and  FE  are  supported  on  E ,  so  by  the  induction  hypothesis,  they  both  come 
from  algebraic  coherent  sheaves.  It  follows  that  for  n  large  enough,  the  terms  H 2(P˜
r  , G (n)) 
C
and  H 1(P˜
r  , FE (n)) both  vanish.  We  thus  obtain  inequalities 
C

dimC H 1(P˜

r  , F (n  − 1))  ≥  dimC H 1(P˜
C

r  , H) ≥  dimC H 1(P˜
C

r  , F (n)) 
C

for  n  large.  By  the  previous  Cartan  theorem,  the  terms  of  the  sequence  dimC H 1(P˜
r  , F (n)) 
C
are  all  ﬁnite;  we  just  showed  that  they  are  nonincreasing  for  n  large  enough.  They  thus 
eventually  reach  a  constant  value  for  n  large  enough! 
In particular, for  n  large, the previous inequalities  all become  equalities.  Backing  up  the 
second  of  the  two  long  exact  sequences,  we  see  that 

H 0(P˜ r 
C , F (n))

→  H 0(P˜ r 
C , FE (n)) 

must  be  surjective  for  n  large. 
Again since  FE  is known to be algebraic, for  n  large,  H 0(P˜
r  , FE (n)) generates (FE )z . By 
C
a  quick  Nakayama’s  lemma  argument,  for  such  n,  H 0(P˜
r  , F (n)) also  generates  F (n)z . 
C

Corollary.  Assume  the  third  GAGA  theorem  in  dimensions  up  to  r  − 1.  For  any  coherent 
sheaf  F  on  P˜ r 
C ,  there  exists  an  integer  n0  (depending only  on  F )  such  that  for  any  n  ≥  n0 
and  any  z  ∈  P˜
r  ,  F (n)z  is  generated  by  global  sections  of  F (n). 
C

Proof.  For  a  single  n,  if  the  claim  holds  for  a  single  z ,  it  holds  in  a  neighborhood  of  that  z ; 
moreover,  by  multiplying  these  sections  by  monomials  in  x0 , . . . , xr ,  we  infer  the  claim  for 
all larger  n  in  the  same  neighborhood.  Since  P˜ r  is  compact,  we  may  ﬁnd  a  single  n0  such 
C 
that  F (n)z  is  generated  by  global  sections  of  F (n) for  each  z  ∈  P˜ r  and  each  n  ≥  n0 .
C 
Proof  of  the  theorem.  Let  F  be  a  coherent  sheaf  on  P˜ r  By  the  previous  corollary,  for  some 
C . 
n,  each  stalk  of  F (n) is  generated  by  the  space  of  sections  H 0(P˜
r  , F (n)),  which  by Cartan’s 
C
theorem is  ﬁnite dimensional  over  C. We thus obtain a surjection  h∗O(−n)⊕m  → F  for some 
m, n.  Applying  the  same  argument to the kernel  of this  map (which is  again  coherent),  we 
get  an  exact  sequence 

F1  → F2  → F  →  0 

in  which  each  Fi  is  a  direct  sum  of  pullbacks  of  twisting  sheaves. 
In  particular,  the  Fi 
are  algebraic;  by  the  second  GAGA  theorem,  the  morphism  between  them  is  also  algebraic. 
We  may  then  form  the  algebraic  cokernel,  whose  analytiﬁcation  is  isomorphic  to  F ,  as 
desired.

6  More  analytiﬁcation 

One can state the GAGA theorems more generally, but  ﬁrst we need  to discuss analytiﬁcation 
of  spaces  other  than  pro jective  space.  We  ﬁrst  specify  the  target  category:  a  locally  ringed 
space (X, OX ) is  a  complex  analytic  space  if  each  point  x  admits  a  neighborhood  U  and  an 
immersion  φ  :  U  →  Cn  for  some  n.  This  is  not  the  same  as  a  complex  manifold  because  we 
allow singularities,  and for that  matter nonreducedness (so these shouldn’t be called  complex 
analytic  varieties  either).  Let  AnSp  denote  the  category  of  complex  analytic  spaces. 
We  would  like  a  process  for  turning  schemes  locally  of  ﬁnite  type  over  C  into  complex 
analytic  spaces  in  a  natural  way.  It  is  easy  to  say  what  we  want  to  have  happen  in  local 
coordinates:  if  X  = Spec C[z1 , . . . , zn ]/(f1 , . . . , fm),  we  want  to  take  the  subspace  Z  of  Cn 
on  which  f1  =  · · ·  =  fm  = 0,  equipped  with  the  quotient  of  OCn  by  the  coherent  ideal  sheaf 
generated by  f1 , . . . , fm  (or  rather,  its  inverse  image  on Z ). 
However,  if  one  works  this  way,  one  has  to  check  independence  from  coordinates.  This  is 
doable but  annoying (it’s like Hartshorne’s Proposition II.2.14  comparing  certain schemes to 
varieties).  There is a more functorial description of analytiﬁcation introduced by Grothendieck; 
see  SGA  I,  expos´e  XII,  Th´eor`eme-D´eﬁnition  1.1.

�→  HomLocRingSp (Y , X ) 

from  AnSp  to  Set  is  represented  by  an  analytic  space  X an ;  that  is,  there  are  natural  isomor­
phisms 

HomLocRingSp (Y , X ) →  HomAnSp (Y , X an ). 
Moreover,  X an  has  underlying  set  X (C),  and  the  morphism  X an  →  X  induces isomorphisms 
of  completed  local  rings,  and  so  is  ﬂat. 

You  could  interpret  this  as  saying  that  the  inclusion  functor  from  analytic  spaces  to 
locally  ringed  spaces  has  a  “partial  right  adjoint”. 

Sketch  of  proof.  One  ﬁrst  shows  that  the  class  of  schemes  for  which  the  theorem  holds  is 
closed  under forming  open subschemes,  closed  subschemes,  and products, by  mirroring  these 
constructions  on  the  analytic  side.  It  then  suﬃces  to  check  the  theorem  for  X  =  A1 ;  this 
C
amounts to  observing  that giving  a  map  Y  →  X  is the  same (by  the  adjunction property  of 
aﬃne  schemes)  as  specifying  a  map  C[t] →  Γ(Y , OY ), which in turn is the same as specifying 
the  image  of  t.  That  is,  Hom(Y , X )  is  naturally  isomorphic  to  Γ(Y , OY ).  On  the  other 
hand,  if  we  view  C  as  an  analytic  space  in  the  obvious  fashion,  then  we  may  again  identify 
Hom(Y , C) naturally  with  holomorphic  functions  on  Y ,  i.e.,  with  Γ(Y , OY ).  This proves the 
claim  for  aﬃne  space. 

This  paradigm  extends  to  other  categories  derived  from  schemes.  For  instance,  for  k  an 
algebraically  closed  ﬁeld,  separated  reduced  schemes  of  ﬁnite  type  over  k  admit  “varietiﬁca­
tions”, thus reproducing  the class of  abstract  algebraic varieties and giving  a stronger version 
of Hartshorne Proposition II.2.14.

7  Extension  to  pro jective  and  proper  schemes 

In  terms  of  the  analytiﬁcation  functor,  we  can  now  extend  the  GAGA  theorems  as  follows. 
Theorem  (GAGA  for  pro jective  schemes).  Let  X  be  a  closed  subscheme  of  Pr  for  some 
C 
r  ≥  1.  Let  h  :  X an  →  X  be  the  analytiﬁcation  morphism. 

(a)  For  any  coherent  sheaf  F  on  X ,  the  natural  morphism 

H i (X, F ) →  H i(X an , h∗F ) 

is  an  isomorphism. 

(b)  For  any  coherent  sheaves  F , G  on  X ,  the  natural  morphism 

HomOX (F , G ) →  HomOX an (h∗F , h∗G ) 

is  an  isomorphism. 

(c)  Every  coherent  sheaf  on  X an  is  isomorphic  to  h∗F  for  a  unique  coherent  sheaf  F  on 
X . 

r  ,  so  some  sort  of  completeness 
We  saw  earlier that  already (a)  is totally  false for  X  =  A
C
is necessary.  Grothendieck  noticed  that it  suﬃces to assume  X  is  proper  over  C; this reduces 
to the pro jective  case  using  Chow’s lemma (exercise). 

8  Applications 

The GAGA  theorem has  applications too  numerous to  count,  so I’ll just  mention  a few (see 
SGA  1,  expos´e  XII  for  more).  The  following  was  proved  before  GAGA  by  Chow,  but  is  an 
immediate  corollary. 
Corollary  (Chow).  Any  closed  analytic  subvariety  of  P˜ r  is  the  analytiﬁcation  of  a  closed 
C 
algebraic  subvariety. 

Another  application  is  the  following. 

Theorem.  Let  X  be  a  smooth  proper  scheme  over  C.  Then 
) =  H p (X an , Ωq 
H p(X, Ωq 
)
X an 
X/C

(p, q  ≥  0).

This  can  be  used  to  show  that  the  hypercohomology  of  the  algebraic  de  Rham  complex 
Ω. 
coincides  with  the hypercohomology  of  the analytic de Rham complex.  (If F  :  C1  → C2
X/C 
is  a  left  exact  additive  functor  of  abelian  categories  with  C1  having  enough  injectives,  the 
hypercohomology  of  a  complex  C ·  is  deﬁned  by  forming  a  quasi-isomorphism  C ·  →  I ·  with 
the  I all injective,  and  taking  hi (F (I ·)).  More on this construction a bit later.)  This in turn 
·
can be combined  with  some more results on the analytic/topological  side (the Dolbeault  and 
de Rham theorems,  respectively)  to show that  algebraic de Rham cohomology  computes the 
usual  topological  Betti  numbers  of  a  smooth  variety  over  C. 
Here  is  another  application  by  Grothendieck.  See  SGA  1,  expos´e  XII  again.

Theorem  (Grothendieck).  Let  X  be  a  smooth  proper  scheme  over  C.  Then  any  ﬁnite 
covering  space  map  Y  →  X an  (of topological  spaces)  corresponds  to  a  ﬁnite  ´etale  cover  of  X 
in  the  category  of  schemes. 

One  can  deﬁne  the  ´etale fundamental group  of  a  scheme  X  as,  roughly  speaking,  the 
automorphism  group  of  a  maximal  inverse  system  of  connected  ﬁnite  ´etale  covers  of  X . For 
instance, if  X  = Spec F  with  F  a  ﬁeld, this gives the absolute Galois group  of  F .  (To  make 
this  more  precise,  one  must  ﬁx  a  choice  of  a  basepoint  just  as  in  the  topological case.)  The 
previous  theorem  implies  that  for  a  smooth  proper  scheme  over  C,  the  ´etale  fundamental 
group is the proﬁnite completion  of  the usual  topological fundamental group, i.e., the inverse 
limit  of  its  ﬁnite  quotients.  For  instance,  for  an  elliptic  curve,  the  topological  fundamental 
group  is  Z ×  Z,  while  the  proﬁnite  completion  is 
Z� × Z� ∼ � 
(Zp 
=
p 
where  Zp  denotes the  p-adic integers. 

×  Zp ),

Corollary.  Let  K  be  a  number  ﬁeld  and  let  X  be  a  smooth proper  scheme  over  K .  Then  the 
proﬁnite  completion  of  the  fundamental  group  of  (X  ×K  C)an  does  not  depend  on  the  choice 
of the embedding 
.C→֒K

This  might  not  be  so  surprising  until  I  tell  you  that  Serre  exhibited  examples  in  which 
the  topological  fundamental  group  does  depend  on  the  choice  of  the  embedding!  (Serre’s 
example  is  a  rather  artiﬁcial  construction  using  elliptic  curves  with  complex  multiplications. 
There  are  some  more  natural  examples  due  to  one  of  our  postdocs,  Junecue  Suh.) 
The following is an example of a rather large class of  results from SGA 1.  See the exercises 
for  an  example  involving  properness. 

Theorem.  Let  f  :  X  →  Y  be  a  morphism  of  schemes  local ly  of  ﬁnite  type  over  C.  Then  f 
is  separated  if  and  only  if  f an  :  X an  →  Y an  is  separated.  In  particular,  X  is  separated  if  and 
only if  X an  is Hausdorﬀ. 

9  Analogues 

I  know  of  at  least  two  analogues  of  GAGA,  though  there  may  be  more. 

•	 One  is  formal  GAGA,  in  which  one  passes  from  a  scheme  to  its  formal  completion 
along  a  closed  subscheme. 

•	 The  other  is  rigid GAGA,  which  is  like  ordinary  GAGA  except  that  one  works  over  a 
complete  nonarchimedean  ﬁeld,  and  uses  Tate’s  notion  of  rigid  analytic  geometry  (or 
Berkovich’s  notion  of  nonarchimedean  analytic  geometry  instead  of  complex  analytic 
geometry. 

10  

•	 I suppose there is also an instance of GAGA for passing from reduced  separate schemes 
of  ﬁnite  type  over  an  algebraically  closed  ﬁeld  to  abstract  algebraic  varieties.  But  that 
one  is  neither  surprising  nor  useful.
