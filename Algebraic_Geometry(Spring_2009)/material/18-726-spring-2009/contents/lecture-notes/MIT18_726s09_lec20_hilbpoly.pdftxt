Hilbert polynomials  and  ﬂatness (revised 17 Apr 09) 

See  Hartshorne  III.9  again. 

1  Hilbert  polynomials 

Let  k  be a  ﬁeld (not necessarily  algebraically  closed).  Let  j :  X  →  Pr
k  be  a  closed  immersion 
for  some  r  ≥  1.  Write  OX (1) for the inverse image by  j  of  the  twisting  sheaf  O(1).  Let  F 
be  a  ﬁnitely  generated  quasicoherent  sheaf  on  X . 
The  Euler  characteristic  of  F  is  deﬁned  as 

χ(X, F ) =

∞ 
� 
(−1)i  dimk  H i(X, F ); 
i=0 

we know from Serre’s  ﬁniteness theorem that  each  summand is  ﬁnite,  and  we  also know that 
there  are  no  terms  in  dimension  greater  than  r .  So  this  is  indeed  a  well-deﬁned  integer. 

Lemma.  The  Euler  characteristic  is  additive  in  short  exact  sequences;  that  is,  if 

is  exact,  then 

0  → F  → G  → H  →  0 

χ(X, G ) =  χ(X, F ) + χ(X, H). 

Proof.  Exercise  in  the  long  exact  sequence  in  cohomology. 

Corollary.  If 

0  → F1  →  · · ·  → Fn  →  0 

is  an  exact  sequence  of  ﬁnitely  generated  quasicoherent  sheaves,  then 

n 
� 
(−1)iχ(X, Fi ) = 0. 
i=1 

Theorem.  There  exists  a  polynomial  P (z) ∈  Q[z ]  such that 

χ(X, F (n)) =  P (n)

(n  ∈  Z). 

Moreover,  the  degree  of  P  is  at  most  the  dimension  of  X . 

Proof.  By  replacing  F  by  j∗F ,  we  may  reduce  to  the  case  X  =  Pr
k .  Also,  changing  the  base 
ﬁeld doesn’t change  any  of the dimensions (e.g., by looking  at  ˇCech  cohomology;  this  is  a 
special  case  of  the  ﬂat  base  change  theorem ),  so  we  may assume  k  is  algebraically  closed. 
We proceed by induction  on the dimension  of  the support  of  F . If  that  support is empty 
(i.e., F  is  the  zero  sheaf ),  then  obviously  P (z) = 0  works.

Otherwise,  form  an  exact  sequence 

×xr
0  → G  → F (−1)  → F  → H  →  0 

and  note  that  G  and  H  have  support  of  lower  dimension  than  F  provided  that  we  ensure 
that the hyperplane  xr  =  0  does  not  contain  any  component  of  the  support  of  F .  (We  can 
arrange  this  given  that  k  is  algebraically  closed;  see  exercises.  In  fact,  k  inﬁnite  would  be 
suﬃcient.)  By  the  induction  hypothesis,  we  know  that  χ(Pr
k , F (n)) − χ(Pr
k , F (n  − 1))  is  a 
polynomial in  n  of  degree  at  most  dim(Supp F ) − 1.  It  is  an  elementary  exercise  in  algebra 
to  then  see  that  χ(Pr
k , F (n)) is  a  polynomial  in  n  of  degree  at  most  dim(Supp F ). 

The polynomial  P (n) is called the  Hilbert polynomial  of  the sheaf  F ; in case F  =  OX , we 
call it the  Hilbert polynomial  of  the scheme  X  itself.  Note that by Serre’s vanishing  theorem, 
for  some  n0 ,  we  have 

P (n) = dimk  H 0(X, F )

(n  ≥  n0); 

this  was  the  original  deﬁnition  of  the  Hilbert  polynomial. 
For  example,  the  Hilbert  polynomial  of  Pr  itself is  P (n) =  n+r  .  For  another  example,

k
n 
the  Hilbert  polynomial  of  the  subscheme  Spec k [x]/(x2 )  of  P1 
k  is  P (n)  =  2,  which  is  the 
same  as  the  Hilbert  polynomial  of  a  scheme  consisting  of  two  distinct  reduced  points.  This 
is  suggestive,  because  this  scheme  can  indeed  be  written  as  a  ﬂat  limit  of  pairs  of  distinct 
points. 

2  Flatness  and  Hilbert  polynomials 

The  Hilbert  polynomial  can  be  used  to  give  the  following  numerical  criterion  for  ﬂatness. 
(The  locally noetherian  hypothesis  is  important;  I  think  one  can  replace  “integral”  by  “con­
nected  and  reduced”.) 

Theorem.  Let  T  be  an integral (local ly)  noetherian  scheme.  Let  X  ⊆  Pr
T  be  a  closed  sub-
scheme.  Let  F  be  a  coherent  sheaf  on  X .  For  each  t  ∈  T ,  let  Pt  ∈  Q[z ]  be  the  Hilbert 
polynomial  of  the  pul lback  of  F  to  the  ﬁbre  Xt  viewed  as  a  subscheme  of  Pr
κ(t)  (where 
κ(t) =  OT ,t/mT ,t  is  the  residue  ﬁeld  of  the  point  t).  Then  F  is  ﬂat  relative  to  X  →  T 
if  and  only  if  Pt  is  constant  as  a  function  of  t. 

In particular,  X  itself  is  ﬂat  over  T  if  and  only if  the Hilbert polynomial  of  Xt  is constant 
as  t  varies.  This  gives  us  a  way  to  check  whether  a  morphism  is  ﬂat  which  we  were  sorely 
lacking before. 

Proof.  (Compare  Hartshorne  Theorem  III.9.9,  or  EGA  III §7.9.)  We  ﬁrst  note  that  we  can 
r  by  replacing  F  with its direct image.  We next  note that it  suﬃces 
reduce to the case  X  =  PT
to  consider  the  case  where  T  = Spec A  for  A  a  local  integral  noetherian  ring. 
We  then  show  that  F  is  ﬂat  over  T  if  and  only  if  H 0(X, F (m)) is  ﬁnite  free  over  A  for 
m  suﬃciently  large.  On  one  hand,  if  F  is  ﬂat  over  T ,  then  so  are  all  the  terms  in  the  sheafy 

2


ˇCech  resolution  of  F (m) for the usual open cover  U (since open immersions are  ﬂat).  Taking 
global  sections,  we  see  that  the  terms  of  the  exact  sequence 
0  →  H 0(X, F (m)) →  Cˇ 0(U, F (m)) →  · · ·  →  Cˇ r (U, F (m)) →  0 
are  all  ﬂat  except  possibly  for  the  ﬁrst  term.  This  then  implies  ﬂatness  of  H 0(X, F (m)) 
(exercise).  Since  it’s  also  ﬁnitely  generated  over  A  by  Serre’s  ﬁniteness  theorem,  it  is  free. 
On the other hand, if  we pick  m0  such  that  H 0(X, F (m)) is  ﬁnite free over A  for  m  ≥  m0 , 
then  we  can  recover  F  as  M˜ for 

M  = 

� 
m≥m0 

H 0(X, F (m)). 

Since  M  is  ﬂat,  so  is  F . 
We  now  need  to  show  that  H 0(X, F (m))  is  ﬁnite  free  for  m  large  if  and  only  if  Pt  is 
constant.  I  claim  that  this  follows  by  checking 
H 0(Xt , Ft(m)) =  H 0(X, F (m)) ⊗A  κ(t) 
for  m  large (even if I don’t prove this  uniformly  in  t).  Namely,  if  H 0(X, F (m)) is  ﬁnite  free 
over  A  for  m  ≥  m0 ,  then  for  each  t, for  m  large,  I  ﬁnd  that  Pt  equals  Pη  for  η  the generic 
point  of  T .  On  the  other  hand,  if  Pt  is  the  same  for  the  generic  point  and  the  closed  point, 
then I  can make  m  large enough  to work for both, and  obtain  ﬁnite freeness of  H 0(X, F (m)). 
To  check 

H 0(Xt , Ft(m)) =  H 0(X, F (m)) ⊗A  κ(t), 
we  may  reduce  to  the  case  where  t  is  the  closed  point  by  replacing  A  with  OT ,t .  Since  A  is 
noetherian,  we  can  ﬁnd  a  short  exact  sequence 
A⊕n  →  A  →  κ(t) →  0 

of  A-modules.  We can then tensor with  F  to get  an exact  sequence;  it follows (exercise)  that 
H 0(X, F (m)⊕n) →  H 0(X, F (m)) →  H 0(X, Ft(m)) →  0 

is  exact  for  m  large.  I  can  pull  out  the  direct  sum,  and  then  we  read  oﬀ  what  we  want. 

3  Hilbert  schemes 

It  turns  out  that  there  is  a  universal  family  of  closed  subschemes  of  pro jective  space  with  a 
ﬁxed Hilbert polynomial. 

Theorem  (Grothendieck).  Fix  a  ﬁeld  k  and  an  integer  r .  Let  P (z) ∈  Q[z ] be  a  polynomial. 
There  exists  a  noetherian  scheme  H  over  Spec k  and  a  closed  subscheme  X  of  Pr  which is 
H 
ﬂat  with  Hilbert  polynomial  P (z),  such  that  for  any  noetherian  scheme  T  and  any  closed 
subscheme  Y  of  Pr
T  which  is  ﬂat  with  Hilbert  polynomial  P (z),  there  is  a  unique  morphism 
∼
T  →  H  such that  Y  =  X  ×H  T  as  closed  subschemes  of  Pr  =  Pr  ×H  T .
T
H 
For  instance,  one  can  show  that  a  closed  subscheme  of  Pr
k  is  a  d-dimensional plane if  and 
only  if it has Hilbert polynomial  P (n) =  � n+
d−1� .  The  parameter  scheme  in  this  case  is  the 
n
Grassmannian  of  d-dimensional planes in  Pr
k .

4  Hilbert  polynomials,  degree,  and  dimension 

Some  of  the basic information contained in the Hilbert polynomial  of  a scheme is the follow­
ing. 

Lemma.  Let  P (z) be  the  Hilbert  polynomial  of  a  closed  subscheme  X  of  Pn
k . 

(a)  We  have  deg(P ) = dim(X ). 

(b)  Put  d  = dim(X ).  For  any  d-dimensional plane  P  ⊆  Pn
k  such  that  dim(X  ∩  P )  = 0, 
the  length  of  X  ∩ P  is  d!  times  the  leading  coeﬃcient  of  P .  (This  length  is  cal led  the 
degree  of  X .) 

Proof.  We  may  assume  k  is  algebraically  closed.  We  ﬁrst  need  to  know  that  for  a  generic  d­
dimensional plane  P  (i.e.,  one  chosen  outside  some  closed subscheme  of  the  Grassmannian), 
we have dim(X  ∩ P ) =  0.  This  follows  from  the  fact  that  as  long  as  X 
6=  ∅,  for  a  generic 
hyperplane  H ,  we  have  dim(X  ∩ H ) <  dim(X ) (exercise). 
n  the  given  closed  immersion.  For  H  a  hyperplane  with 
Put  F  =  j∗OX  for  j  :  X  →  Pk
dim(X  ∩ H ) <  dim(X ),  we  have  an  exact  sequence 

0  → F (−1)  → F  → G  →  0 

where  G  is the direct image of  the structure sheaf  of  X ∩ H . If  P (z) is the Hilbert polynomial 
of  X ,  it  follows  that  the  Hilbert  polynomial  of  X  ∩ H  is  P (z) − P (z  − 1).  From  this,  both 
claims follows.
