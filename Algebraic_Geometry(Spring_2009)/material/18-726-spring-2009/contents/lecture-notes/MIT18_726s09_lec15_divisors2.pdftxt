Divisors  on  curves  and  Riemann-Roch  (updated  31  Mar  09) 

We  continue  the  discussion  of  divisors  but  now  restricted  to  curves.  Again,  see  IV.1  for 
Riemann-Roch  and  IV.2  for Riemann-Hurwitz. 

1  The  Riemann-Roch  theorem 

Again, let X  be a (pro jective, irreducible, nonsingular) curve over an algebraically closed ﬁeld 
k .  Since  X  is  one-dimensional,  the  canonical  sheaf  �X/k  coincides  with  the  sheaf  of  K¨ahler 
diﬀerentials  �X/k .  By a  canonical  divisor,  I  mean  a  divisor  K  deﬁned  by  any  meromorphic 
section  of  �X/k .  (This  means  that  a  canonical  divisor  is  in  fact  not  canonical  in  any  sense. 
Sorry  about  that.) 
As  in  the  elliptic  curve  example,  there  is  a  homomorphism  Div X  � Z  sending  (P )  to  1 
for  each  P  ≤ X (k),  and  this  factors  through  Cl X  because  any  principal  divisor  has  degree 
0  (Hartshorne,  Corollary  II.6.10). 
Write l(D) as shorthand for dimk �(X, L(D)).  The following theorem will be proved later 
using  properties  of  sheaf  cohomology  (particularly  Serre  duality),  but  in  the  meantime  we 
will  see  (in  this  lecture  and  in  the  next  problem  set)  how  it  tells  us many  useful  things  that 
have  no  overt  relationship  to  cohomology. 

Theorem  (Riemann-Roch).  There  exists  a  nonnegative  integer  g = g (X ) with  the  fol lowing 
property.  For  any  divisor  D  and  any  canonical  divisor  K , 

l(D) − l(K − D) = deg(D) + 1 − g . 

Corollary.  The  integer  g  in  Riemann-Roch  can  be  identiﬁed  as 

g = l(K ) = dimk  �(X, �X/k ). 

Proof.  Take  D  =  0.  Then  l(D)  =  1  because  any  global  regular  function  on  a  curve  (or 
indeed  on  any  pro jective  variety)  is  constant.  This  forces  l(K ) = g . 

The quantity l(K ) is called the genus  of K , or more precisely the geometric genus.  In case 
k  =  C,  this  will  end  up  matching  the  topological  genus  of  the  Riemann  surface  associated 
to X . 

Corollary.  The  integer  g  in  Riemann-Roch  can  also  be  identiﬁed  by  the  formula 

deg(K ) = 2g − 2. 

Proof.  Apply  Riemann-Roch  with D = K  to  obtain  (by  the  previous  corollary) 

g − 1 = l(K ) − l(0) = deg(K ) + 1 − g . 

1 

Corollary.  If  deg(D) > 2g − 2,  or  deg(D) = 2g − 2  and  D  ≥� K ,  then 

l(D) = deg(D) + 1 − g ∼ g − 1. 

Proof.  If deg(D) = 2g −2, then deg(K −D) = 0.  If f  ≤ K (X ) nonzero satisﬁes (f )+K −D ∼ 
0,  we must  have  equality  because  the  left  side  has  degree  0.  Thus  l(K − D)  is  only  nonzero 
if K  � D . 
If deg(D) > 2g − 2,  then  deg(K − D) < 0.  In  this  case,  (f ) + K − D  has  negative  degree 
and  so  cannot  be  eﬀective,  so  l(K − D) = 0  no matter  what. 

Corollary.  For  g ∼ 2,  for  any  divisor D  of  degree  at  least  2g − 1,  the  complete  linear  system 
associated  to  D  deﬁnes  a  closed  immersion  of  D  into  a  projective  space. 

2  The  canonical  (almost)  embedding 

The  canonical  embedding  is  the  map  to  pro jective  space  deﬁned  by  the  complete  linear 
system  associated  to  a  canonical  divisor  K .  The  name  suggests  that  it  is  always  a  closed 
immersion,  but  this  is  only  almost  true;  there  are  a  few  exceptions  in  low  genus  (for  which 
see  the  exercises). 

Lemma.  For  any  point  P  and  any  divisor  D,  we  have 

l(D) �  l(D + P ) �  l(D) + 1. 

Consequently,  l(D) � deg(D) + 1. 

Proof.  We  have  an  exact  sequence  of  sheaves 

0 � L(D) � L(D + (P )) � E � 0 

where  E  is  the  quotient  of  OX  by  the  ideal  sheaf  deﬁning  P .  So  clearly  l(D)  �  l(D + P ). 
On  the  other  hand,  taking  global  sections  yields  a  short  exact  sequence 

0 � �(X, L(D)) � �(X, L(D + (P ))) � �(X, E ) 

and  the  last  term  is  one-dimensional  over  k ,  so  we  get  l(D + P ) �  l(D) + 1. 

Proposition.  The  canonical  embedding  is  a  closed  immersion  if  and  only  if X  is  not  hyper-
el liptic. 

Proof.  The  special  cases  g  = 2, 3  are  discussed  in  the  problem  set,  so  I’ll  only  sketch  the 
general  argument.  Put D = (P ) + (Q)  for P , Q ≤ X (k)  not  necessarily  distinct.  We  need  to 
check  whether  we  always  have 

l(K − D) =  l(K ) − 2 = g − 2. 

2 

By  Riemann-Roch, 

l(K − D) = l(D) + g − 3 
so we have an embedding  if and only  if  l(D) = 0  for any eﬀective D  of degree 2; but a  failure 
of  that  deﬁnes  a  two-to-one map  to  P1 ,  in  which  case X  is  hyperelliptic.  (Strictly  speaking, 
we  should  also check  for D  of degree  1, but  it’s  esay  to  see  that  if  such D  has  l(D) > 0,  then 
there  exists  a  rational  function  on X  with  a  single  pole, which  gives  a  a degree  1 map  to P 1 . 
That  is, X  �= P1 .) 

The  canonical  embedding,  and  variants  of  it  (e.g.,  using  higher  multiples  of  a  canonical 
divisor)  are  key  tools  for  studying  the  moduli  space  of  curves  of  a  given  genus.  This  is 
“almost”  a  scheme  Mg  which  represents  the  functor  taking  schemes  to  families  of  curves  of 
genus  g ,  except  that  this  functor  is  not  quite  representable.  It  becomes  representable  in 
the  category  of  Deligne-Mumford  stacks,  which  extend  schemes  in  much  the  same  way  that 
orbifolds  extend  manifolds  (by  allowing  quotients  by  ﬁnite  group  actions). 

3  The  Riemann-Hurwitz  formula 

Let  f  :  X  �  Y  be  a  ﬁnite  separable  morphism  of  curves  (i.e.,  the  induced  ﬁeld  extension 
k(X )/k(Y )  is  separable).  The  ramiﬁcation  divisor  of  f  is  deﬁned  as 
 

R =  �
P �X (k) 

length(�X/Y  )P (P ), 

where  as  usual  �X/Y  is  the module  of K¨ahler  diﬀerentials. 

Proposition.  We  have 

KX  � f �KY  + R. 

Proof.  (Compare  Hartshorne  Proposition  IV.2.3.)  Note  that 

0 � f ��Y /k  � �X/k  � �X/Y  � 0 

is  exact;  this  follows  from  properties  of K¨ahler  diﬀerentials  except  for  the  injectivity  on  the 
left.  But  that  we  can  check  at  generic  points,  where  it  follows  because  k(X )  is  separable 
over  k(Y ). 
We  can  then  tensor  with  �� 
X/k 
X/k  � OX  � �X/Y  → �� 
0 � (f ��Y /k ) → �� 
X/k  � 0. 
However,  �X/Y  is  supported  on ﬁnitely many points,  so  it  is  isomorphic  to  its  twist by �� 
X/k . 
So  we  really  have  an  isomorphism 

to  obtain  another  exact  sequence 

(f ��Y /k ) → ��  = OX /�X/Y  .
�
X/k 

We  thus  get  an  equality  of  associated  divisors;  these  are  f �KY  − KX  on  the  left  and −R  on 
the  right.

Using  Riemann-Roch,  we  deduce  the  Riemann-Hurwitz  formula. 

Proposition.  We  have 

2g (X ) − 2 = (deg(f ))(2g (Y ) − 2) + deg(R), 

where  deg(f )  is  the  degree  of  f  (i.e.,  the  degree  of  the  ﬁeld  extension  k(X )/k(Y )). 

Moreover,  the  contribution  of  P  ≤  X (k)  can  sometimes  be  computed  very  simply. 
Namely,  put  Q  =  f (P ),  and  pick  t  ≤  k(Y )  which  generates  mY ,Q ;  then  f � (t)  generates 
e 
for  some  nonnegative  integer  e.  We  call  e = eP  the  ramiﬁcation  index  of  P .  Then 
mX,P 

length(�X/Y  )P  ∼ eP  − 1, 

with  equality  if  and  only  if  f  is  tamely  ramiﬁed,  i.e.,  eP  is  not  divisible  by  the  characteristic 
of  k . 
In  case  k  =  C,  the  Riemann-Hurwitz  formula  has  a  topological  meaning:  the  quantity 
2 − 2g (X )  turns  out  to  compute  the Euler  characteristic  of  the  associated Riemann  surface. 
The  Euler  characteristic  (computed  using  homology,  or  compactly  supported  cohomology) 
is  an  additive  invariant  of  a  topological  space.  If  the map  f  were  unramiﬁed,  then we  would 
have  deg(R)  =  0  and  the  space  X  would  have  Euler  characteristic  equal  to  deg(f )  times 
that  of  Y .  Otherwise,  one  must  subtract  eP  − 1  for  each  point  P  with  eP  > 1,  because  you 
get X  from  an unramiﬁed  cover  of Y  by  removing  eP  diﬀerent  points  from  the  ﬁbre  (each  of 
which  has  Euler  characteristic  1)  and  adding  one  point  back  in.
