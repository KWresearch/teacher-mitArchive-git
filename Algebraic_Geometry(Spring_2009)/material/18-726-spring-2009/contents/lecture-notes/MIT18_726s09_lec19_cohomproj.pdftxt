Cohomology  of  pro jective  space  (updated  April  14) 

Using  ˇCech  cohomology,  we  now  give  Serre’s  computation  of  the  cohomology  of  the 
twisting  sheaves on pro jective space, and deduce from it Serre’s  ﬁniteness theorem.  See also 
Hartshorne III.5 (except that you  can ignore the last paragraph  at the bottom  of page 227, 
which is irrelevant). 

1  Finitely  generated  sheaves 

Let (X, OX )  be  a  locally  ringed  space.  An  OX -module  F  is  ﬁnitely generated  if  for  each 
point  x ∈  X ,  there  exist  an  open  subset  U  of  X  containing  x,  a  nonnegative  integer  n,  and 
a  surjection  O⊕n |U  → F |U  of  OX -modules.  (In  other  words, F  is locally generated by  ﬁnite 
X 
collections  of  sections.) 

Lemma.  Let  A  be  a  ring  and  let  M  be  an  A-module.  Then  M  is  ﬁnite  as  an  A-module if 
and  only  if  the  quasicoherent  sheaf  M˜ is  ﬁnitely  generated. 

Proof.  It  is  clear  that  ﬁniteness  of  M  implies  that  M˜ is  ﬁnitely  generated.  Conversely, 
suppose  M˜ is  ﬁnitely generated.  We can then cover  X  with  distinguished  opens  Xi  =  D(fi ) 
hj .  Since  X  is 
on  each  of  which  M˜ |Xi  =  M˜ fi  is  generated  by  ﬁnitely  many  sections  mij /fi
quasicompact,  we  need  only  ﬁnitely  many  i,  and  the  resulting  mij  generate  M  because they 
do  so  stalkwise. 

Beware  that  Hartshorne  says  a  sheaf  is  coherent  if  it  is  quasicoherent  and  ﬁnitely  gen­
erated.  This  is  not  the  correct  deﬁnition,  but  it  does  agree  with  the  correct  deﬁnition  on 
a  local ly  noetherian  scheme,  which  is  the  only  place  he  ever  uses  it. 
I’ll  give  the  proper 
deﬁnition  of  a  coherent  sheaf  later. 

2  Odds  and  ends 

We  will  make  frequent  use  of  the  following  fact. 

Lemma.  Let  f  :  Z →  X  be  a  closed  immersion  of  local ly  ringed  spaces,  and  let  F  be  a  sheaf 
of  abelian  groups  on  Z .  Then  there  are  canonical  isomorphisms 

H i (Z, F ) →  H i(X, f∗F )

(i ≥  0). 

Proof.  We  already  know  that  f∗  preserves  ﬂasqueness (previous  exercise).  We  can  also  see 
that  f∗  is  exact  by  its  behavior  on  stalks: 

(f∗F )x  = 

 
�
Fx  x ∈  Z 
x /∈  Z. 
0

Finally,  we  note  that  we  have  a  canonical  isomorphism  at  the  level  of  H 0 . 
If  we  then 
start  with  a  ﬂasque  resolution  of  F , we can either push forward (obtaining  another  ﬂasque 
resolution)  and  then take global  sections,  or take global  sections directly, to obtain the  same 
complexes,  and  in  particular  the  same  cohomology. 

This  will  very  often  allow  us  to  carry  out  induction  arguments  on  dimension,  by  setting 
up  a  short  exact  sequence  of  sheaves  on  X  in  which  one  member  is  the  direct  image  of  a 
sheaf  on  Z . 

Lemma.  Let  X  be  a  noetherian  topological  space,  and  let  (Fj ) be  a  direct  system  of  abelian 
sheaves.  Then  the  natural  functoriality  maps 

lim H · (X, Fj ) →  H ·  (X, lim Fj )
−→ 
−→ 
(coming  from  the  maps Fj  →  lim Fj ) are  isomorphisms. 
−→ 
Proof.  Fix  the  index  set  for  the  direct  system.  Then  both  sides  are  cohomological  functors 
on  the  category  of  direct  systems  of  abelian  sheaves  for  that  index  set,  and  the  noetherian 
hypothesis forces the  H 0  terms to  match (earlier  exercise),  so it  suﬃces to  check that they 
are  both  eﬀaceable.  For  that,  it  suﬃces  to  observe  that  there  is  a  functorial  way  to  embed 
any  sheaf  of  abelian  groups  on  X  into  a  ﬂasque  sheaf;  for  instance,  see  Hartshorne  exercise 
II.1.16(e). 

3  The  result 

Before  stating  the  theorem,  I  need  to  make  one  general  observation.  Let  F , G  be  sheaves 
of  OX -modules  on  a  scheme  X ,  with  F  quasicoherent  and  ﬂat.  I  claim  there  is  a  natural 
homomorphism 

H 0(X, F ) ⊗OX  H r (X, G ) →  H r (X, F ⊗OX  G ) 
of Γ(X, OX )-modules  for  any nonnegative  integer  r .  It  comes  from  the  facts  that: 

•	 both  sides  are  cohomological  functors  in  G  (using  the  fact  that  F  is  ﬂat  on  the  right 
side,  and  the  fact  that  H 0(X, F ) is  ﬂat  over  O(X ) on  the  left  side); 

•	 the  left  side  is  eﬀaceable  and  hence  universal; 

•	 there  is  a  natural  map  for  r = 0. 
We  can  also  compute  this  map  using  ˇCech  complexes. 
Theorem  (Serre).  Let  A  be  any  ring,  ﬁx  an  integer  r  ≥  1,  and  put  X  =  Pr  and  S  = 
A 
A[x0 , . . . , xn ].

H 0(X, OX (n))

(b)  For  0  < i < r  and  n ∈  Z,  we  have  H i (X, OX (n)) = 0. 

(c)  We  have  H r (X, OX (−r − 1))  ∼ A.= 

(d)  The  natural  A-bilinear  map 

H 0(X, OX (n)) ×  H r (X, OX (−n − r − 1)) 

→  H r (X, OX (−r − 1))  ∼ A

is  a  perfect  pairing  of  ﬁnitely  generated  free  A-modules,  for  each  n ∈  Z.  (That  is,  each 
side  is  isomorphic  to  Hom  of  the  other  side  into  A;  in  particular,  they  have  the  same 
rank.) 

(e)  For  i > r ,  we  have  H i (X, OX (n)) = 0. 

Proof  of  the  theorem.  It is enough  to compute the cohomology  of  the sheaf  F  =  ⊕n∈ZOX (n) 
and keep  track  of  the grading  by  n.  (This  can  be  seen  by applying  the  previous  lemma,  but 
this  forces  a  noetherian  hypothesis.  But  it  is  also  clear  without  such  a  hypothesis,  because 
the  ˇCech  cohomology  computation  we  are  about  to  do  commutes  with  the  direct  sums.) 
For  starters,  recall  that  we  checked part (a)  earlier;  see for instance Hartshorne Proposition 
II.5.13.

the  D+ (xi ) for  i  = 0, . . . , r .  Since  the  complex 
We  use  the  obvious  Cech  resolution  by 
vanishes above degree  r , we immediately get (e).  (This also follows from a general theorem of 
Grothendieck;  see Hartshorne Theorem III.2.7.)  To compute H r (X, F ), we need the cokernel 
of

View  Sx0 ···xr  =  A[x0  , . . . , xr  ]  as  the  free  A-module  generated  by  the  monomials  x0  · · ·  xr 
with  e0 , . . . , er  ∈  Z.  The  image  under  dr−1  of  the  k -th  factor  of  the  product  is  precisely  the 
span  of  the  monomials  with  ek  ≥  0.  Hence  H r (X, F )  is  the  free  A-module generated by 
the  x e
r  with  e0 , . . . , er  < 0,  graded  by  degree.  In  particular,  in  degree  −r − 1,  we  see

To  see (d),  we  must  make the pairing  explicit.  First,  note that there is  nothing  to  check 
if  n <  0,  since  then  H 0(X, OX (n)) =  S−n  =  0  obviously,  and  H 0(X, OX (−n − r − 1))  = 0 
because  there  are  no  monomials  of  degree  greater  than  −r − 1  with  all  exponents  negative. 
So  assume  hereafter  n ≥  0.  If  we  identify  H 0(X, OX (n)) with  the  A-span  of  the  monomials 
in  x0 , . . . , xr  (with  nonnegative  powers)  of  degree  n,  then  the  pairing  with  H r (X, F ) (the

A-span of  the monomials of degree  −n − r − 1 in  x0  , . . . , xr  ) is to simply multiply  together

It  remains to prove (b), which  we do by induction on  r .  The  base  case  is  r = 1, for which 
there  is  nothing  to  check  because  0  < i < r  is  impossible.  Before  running  the  induction,  we

note  that  if  we  localize  the  Cech  complex  by  inverting 
complex  on  the  open  set  D+ (xr ),  which  is  aﬃne.  So  the  localized  ˇCech  complex  must  be 
acyclic  since  it  computes  the  cohomology  of  a  quasicoherent  sheaf  on  an  aﬃne  scheme.  On 
the  other  hand,  localizing  in  xr  is  exact,  so  it  commutes  with  taking  cohomology;  that  is,

the localization  H i (X, F )xr  = 0 for  i >  0.  In  other  words,  every  element  of  H i (X, F ) is 
annihilated  by  some  power  of  xr . 
It  thus  suﬃces  to  show  that  for  0  < i < r ,  multiplication  by  any  power  of  xr  is injective 
on  H i(X, F ); it  also  suﬃces  to  check  multiplication  by  xr  itself.  Look  at  the  exact  sequence 

×xr
0  →  S (−1)  →  S →  S/(xr ) →  0 

of graded  S -modules.  Writing  H  ∼ P
= 
inclusion,  this  sheaﬁﬁes  to 

r−1  for the hyperplane  xr  =  0  and  j  :  H  →  X  for the 
A

0  → F (−1)  → F  → ⊕n∈Z (j∗OH )(n) →  0. 

Let’s take the long exact  sequence in homology.  In degree 0 we get back  our original  sequence, 
so  the  connecting  homomorphism  into  H 1(X, F (−1))  is  zero.  That  (which  holds  even  in 
the  base  case)  plus  the  induction  hypothesis,  which  implies  that  H i (X, ⊕n (j∗OH )(n))  = 
H i (H, ⊕nOH (n)) = 0 for 0  < i < r − 1,  gives  us  the  bijectivity  of  multiplication  by  xr  on 
H i (X, F ) for i = 0, . . . , r − 2 and injectivity for  i =  r − 1.  This is enough  to get  H i (X, F ) = 0 
for 0  < i < r . 

4  Finiteness  of  cohomology  on  pro jective  schemes 

Using  the  previous  calculation,  Serre  was  able  to  derive  a  powerful  ﬁniteness  and  vanish­
ing  theorem  for  cohomology  on  pro jective  schemes.  First,  we  need  another  result  of  Serre 
(Hartshorne  II.5.17 except  without  the  noetherian  hypothesis). 

Theorem.  Let  A  be  a  ring,  let  X  →  Pr  be  a  closed  immersion  for  some  r  ≥  1,  and  let 
A 
OX (1) be  the  pul lback  of  the  twisting  sheaf.  Let  F  be  a  ﬁnitely  generated  quasicoherent  sheaf 
on  X .  Then  there  exists  an  integer  n0  such  that  for  al l  n ≥  n0 ,  F (n) is  generated  by  a  ﬁnite 
number  of  global  sections. 

r 
Proof.  By  replacing  F  by  its  direct  image,  we  reduce  to  the  case  X  =  P
itself.  For 
A
i  = 0, . . . , r ,  we  have  F |D+ (xi )  =  M˜ i  for  some  ﬁnitely  generated  module  Mi  over  Bi  = 
A[x0/xi , . . . , xr /xi ].  For  any  s ∈  Mi , for  n ≥  n0  for  some  n0  depending  on  s,  xi
n s  is  a  section 
of  F (n).  For  n0  large  enough,  we  can  lift  a  set  of  generators  of  each  Mi  to  sections  of  F (n) 
whenever  n ≥  n0 ;  this  proves  the  claim. 

Corollary.  With  notation as in the previous theorem,  we obtain a surjection  ⊕m
i=1O(n) → F 
for  some  n ∈  Z. 

For  this  I  need  a  noetherian  hypothesis,  but  only  until  we  deﬁne  coherent  sheaves. 

Theorem  (Serre).  Let  A  be  a  noetherian  ring, let  X  →  Pr  be  a  closed  immersion  for  some 
A 
r  ≥  1,  and  let  OX (1)  be  the  pul lback  of  the  twisting  sheaf.  Let  F  be  a  ﬁnitely  generated 
quasicoherent  sheaf  on  X . 

4 

(a)  The  A-modules  H i (X, F ) are  ﬁnitely  generated  for  i ≥  0. 

(b)  There  exists  an  integer  n0  (depending  on  F )  such  that  for  each  i >  0  and  n  ≥  n0 , 
H i (X, F (n)) = 0. 

Proof.  We proceed by  descending  induction  on  i.  For  i > r ,  we  have  H i (X, F ) = 0 because 
X  admits  a  good  over  by  at  most  r + 1  open  aﬃnes. 
By  the previous  corollary,  we  can  write  F  as a quotient  of  some sheaf  E  which  is  a  direct 
sum  of  twisting  sheaves.  Let  G  be the kernel: 

0  → G  → E  → F  →  0 

Thanks to the noetherian hypothesis,  we may  conclude that  G  is also  ﬁnitely generated.  The 
long  exact  sequence  in  cohomology  gives: 

·  ·  ·  →  H i (X, E ) →  H i(X, F ) →  H i+1(X, G ) →  · · · 

Given  the  claim  for  i + 1, we know that the right term is  ﬁnitely generated  as an  A-module. 
The left term is a sum of  things of  the form  H i(X, OX (n)) for various n ∈  Z, and  we already 
computed  those  and  saw  that  they  were  ﬁnitely  generated  as  A-modules.  Again  since  A  is 
noetherian, we can conclude that the middle module is  ﬁnitely generated.  This proves (a). 
To get (b), twist by  n  and  then  again  take  the  long  exact  sequence  in  cohomology: 

·  ·  ·  →  H i (X, E (n)) →  H i (X, F (n)) →  H i+1(X, G (n)) →  · · · 

For  n  large,  the  right  module  vanishes  by  the  induction  hypothesis,  while  the  left  module 
vanishes  by  the  explicit  calculation,  so  the  middle  group  vanishes.
