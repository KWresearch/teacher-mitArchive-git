18.726:  Algebraic  Geometry  (K.S.  Kedlaya,  MIT,  Spring  2009) 
Sheaves  (updated  12  Feb  09) 

We  are  now  ready  to  introduce  the  basic  building  block  in  the  theory  of  schemes,  the 
notion  of  a  sheaf.  See  also:  Hartshorne  II.1,  EGA  1  0.3.  (The  latter  means:  look  in  the 
“Chapitre 0” section of EGA volume 1.)  The base reference for this bit of EGA is Godement, 
Th´eorie  des  Faisceaux. 
Note  that  Hartshorne  assumes  all  sheaves  take  values  in  the  category  of  abelian  groups, 
that being the case of most  interest  in algebraic geometry.  I will only  impose that restriction 
in  the  next  lecture. 

1  Presheaves 

Fix  a  category  C ,  e.g.,  sets  or  abelian  groups.  Given  a  topological  space  X ,  let  X  be  the 
category  of  open  sets  of  X . A  presheaf  on  X  with  values  in  C  is  a  contravariant  functor 
F  : X  � C .  the  category  of  open  sets  of X  to  C .  In  other words,  to  specify  a  sheaf F  on X , 
you must  specify: 

(a)  for  each  open  subset  U  of X  an  element  F (U ) ∅ C ; 

(b)  for  each  inclusion	 V  →  U  of  open  subsets  of  X  a  morphism  ResU,V  =  ResU,V (F ) :

F (U ) � F (V )  (called  restriction ),  such  that:


(i)  for  each  open  subset  U  of X ,  ResU,U  =  idF (U ) ; 
(ii)  for each series of inclusions W  → V  → U  of open subsets of X , we have ResV ,W  ∩ ResU,V  = 
ResU,W  within  Hom(U, W ). 

There  seems  to  be  some  confusion  over  whether  it  is  required  that  F (�)  is  required  to  be 
a  ﬁnal  ob ject  of  C ;  Hartshorne’s  two  characterizations  of  presheaves  disagree  on  this  point 
(because  the deﬁnition  of a  functor doesn’t  include  this condition).  Fortunately,  this doesn’t 
have any serious consequences;  the deﬁnition of a sheaf will stamp out this ambiguity.  (EGA 
avoids  this  issue  by  omitting  the  deﬁnition  of  a  presheaf  entirely!) 
We  will  typically  use  this  deﬁnition  in  cases  where  C  carries  a  forgetful  functor  to  Set. 
In  that  case,  it  makes  sense  to  speak  of  the  elements  of  F (U )  for  U  an  open  subset  of  X ; 
we  call  these  elements  the  sections  of  F  on  U .  For  V  →  U  an  inclusion  of  open  sets,  and 
s ∅ F (U ),  we  often  write  s|V  instead  of  ResU,V (s). 
The  restriction  of  a  presheaf F  on X  to  an  open  subset  U  of X  is  deﬁned  in  the  obvious 
fashion.  It  is  denoted  F |U .  It  is  also  called  the  induced  presheaf  of F  on  U . 
If F1 , F2  : X  � C  are both presheaves  on a topological space X  with values  in a category 
C , a  morphism  F1  � F2  of  presheaves  is  a  natural  transformation  of  functors  from  F1  to 
F2 ,  i.e.,  a  collection  of maps  F1 (U ) � F2 (U )  compatible  with  restrictions.

2  Sheaves 

Here  is  an  example  of  a  set-valued  presheaf  F :  take  another  topological  space  Y ,  and  put 
F (U )  =  HomTop (U, Y )  (the  continuous  functions  from  U  to  Y )  with  restriction  being  the 
usual restriction of functions.  This example has a special feature not implied by the deﬁnition 
of  a  presheaf:  a  continuous  function  can  be  speciﬁed  local ly.  In  other  words,  for  any  index 
set  I ,  if  {Vi}i�I  is  a  family  of  open  sets  with  union  U ,  then  on  one  hand,  each  element  of 
F (U )  is  uniquely  determined  by  its  restrictions  to  all  of  the  V i ;  and  on  the  other  hand,  any 
family  of  elements  of F (Vi )  which  agree  on  the  overlaps  of  the  Vi  gives  a  section  over  U . 
This  is  formalized  by  the  notion  of  a  sheaf.  A  sheaf  on X  with  values  in  C  is  a  presheaf 
with  the  following  property  (called  the  sheaf  axiom ). 

Axiom  (Sheaf  axiom).  For  any  index  set  I ,  for  any  family  of  open  sets  {V i}i�I  which  form 
a  cover  of  the  open  set  U ,  the  ob ject  F (U )  is  the  limit  of  the  diagram  formed  by  the  F (V i) 
for  i ∅ I ,  the  F (Vi  ∼ Vj )  for  i, j  ∅ I ,  and  the  arrows  ResVi ,Vi�Vj  for  i, j  ∅ I . 

Let  us make  this  explicit  in  case  C  = Set.  Deﬁne  I , U, Vi  as  in  the  sheaf  axiom. 

(i)  If  s1 , s2  ∅ F (U )  is  such  that  s1 |Vi  =  s2 |Vi  for  all  i,  then  s1  =  s2 .  (If  C  =  Ab,  we  can 
just  check  this  for  s2  = 0.) 

(ii)  Suppose  we  are  given  for  each  i ∅ I ,  an  element  si  ∅ F (Vi )  such  that  for  each  i, j  ∅ I , 
si |Vi�Vj  = sj |Vi�Vj .  Then  there  exists  an  element  s ∅ F (U )  such  that  s|Vi  = si  for  each 
i.	 (The  element  s  is  unique  by  (i).) 

We  deﬁne  restriction  of  sheaves,  and  morphisms  of  sheaves,  by  copying  the  deﬁnitions 
from  presheaves. 
Some  examples  of  sheaves: 

•	 On  a  manifold,  the  continuous  functions  to  some  ﬁxed  topological  space.  Special 
example:  if  you  take  a  target  space  C  equipped  with  the  discrete  topology,  you  get 
what’s  called  the  local ly  constant  sheaf  associated  to  C . 

•	 On  a  diﬀerentiable  manifold,  the  diﬀerentiable  functions. 

•	 On  a  complex  manifold,  the  holomorphic  functions. 

•	 On an abstract algebraic variety over an algebraically closed ﬁeld, the regular functions, 
or  the  diﬀerential  forms. 

These all come from a class of ob jects called local ly ringed  spaces, which we will discuss  later. 
Although  sheaves  can  be  deﬁned  to  take  values  in  an  arbitrary  category,  we  will  only 
be  interested  in  cases  where  the  category  consists  of  ob jects with  well-deﬁned  elements,  and 
all  the  glueing  is  determined  by  the  elements.  So  to  keep  things  simple,  let  me  drop  in  a 
hypothesis  that  I  would  like  to  keep  in  place  from  now  on.  (With  only  limits,  Grothendieck 
calls this hypothesis (E). However, we’ll want the colimits in order to talk about stalks later.) 

2


Hypothesis  (E).  Assume  hereafter  that  all  sheaves  under  discussion  take  values  in  a  ﬁxed 
category  C  which  admits  a  forgetful  functor  to  Set  that  reﬂects  smal l  limits  and  colimits. 
That  is,  all  small  (indexed  by  sets)  limits  exist,  and  their  formation  commutes  with  passage 
to  Set. 

For  example,  C  could  be  Set  itself.  It  could  also  be  any  one  of  the  usual  “algebraic” 
categories:  Ab,  Grp,  Ring,  ModR  for  a  ring  R,  etc.  Under  this  hypothesis,  the  sheaf  axiom 
for  C  is  exactly  as  for  Set,  so  a  presheaf  is  a  sheaf  if  and  only  if  it  becomes  a  sheaf  after 
composing  with  the  forgetful  functor.  We  can  thus  forget  the  extra  structure  of  C  when 
checking  basic  facts  about  sheaves. 
A  typical  bad  example  is  Top;  the  basic  problem  is  that  the  image  of  a morphism  under 
the  forgetful  functor  can  be  an  isomorphism  even  if  the  original morphism  is  not.  That  is,  a 
continuous  bijection  of  topological  spaces  need  not  be  a  homeomorphism. 
Here  is  a  trick  for  dealing  with  bad  cases:  given  a  presheaf  F  on  X ,  for  each  ob ject 
Y  ∅ C ,  let FY  be the presheaf on X  with values  in Set deﬁned by U  ⊆� Hom(Y , F (U )).  Then 
F  is  a  sheaf  if  and  only  if  each  FY  is  a  sheaf. 

3  Deﬁning  sheaves  on  a  basis 

It  is  very  often  convenient  not  to  have  to  explicitly  specify  the  sections  of  a  sheaf  on  every 
open  subset,  but  simply  on  a  basis  of  open  sets.  Recall  that  a  basis  (of  open  sets)  in  a 
topological  space X  is  a  collection  of  open  sets  such  that  every  open  set  can  be written  as  a 
union  of  elements  of  the  basis. 
Let  X  be  a  topological  space,  and  let  X  be  the  category  of  open  sets  of  X .  Let  B  be 
a  basis  of  X ,  and  let  B  be  the  full  subcategory  of  X  with  Ob j(B ) = B .  (That  is,  keep  all 
of  the  morphisms.)  A  presheaf  on  X  speciﬁed  on  B  is  a  contravariant  functor  from  B  to  C . 
A  sheaf  on  X  speciﬁed  on  B  is  a  presheaf  F  on X  speciﬁed  on  B ,  such  that  F  satisﬁes  the 
following modiﬁed  sheaf  axiom. 

Axiom  (Sheaf  axiom  for  a  basis).  For  any  index  set  I ,  for  any  U  ∅  B  and  any  family  of 
open sets {Vi}i�I  in B  which  form a cover of U , we can choose a covering {Wij k }k�Ji,j  of each 
Vi ∼ Vj  such  that  the  ob ject F (U )  is  the  limit  of  the  diagram  formed  by  the F (V i)  for  i ∅ I , 
the  F (Wij k )  for  i, j  ∅ I  and  k ∅ Ji,j ,  and  the  arrows  ResVi ,Wijk  for  i, j  ∅ I  and  k ∅ Ji,j . 

For  example,  suppose  B  is  a  basis  in  which  the  intersection  of  any  two  basic  opens  is  a 
basic  open; Ravi Vakil  calls  this  a nice  basis,  so  I will  too.  For a nice basis,  this  follows  from 
the  sheaf  axiom  applied  to  coverings  of  basic  opens  by  other  basic  opens,  because  you  just 
take  the  trivial  covering  of  V i  ∼ Vj  by  itself.  (The  niceness  condition  is  satisﬁed  in  most  of 
our  examples.) 

Lemma  (Basis  lemma).  Any  sheaf  on  X  speciﬁed  on  B  extends  uniquely  to  a  sheaf  on  X . 
Similarly,  any morphism  between  two  sheaves  on X  speciﬁed  on B  extends  to  a morphism  of 
sheaves  on  X . 

3 

In  other  words,  the  restriction  functor  from  sheaves  on  X  to  sheaves  on  X  speciﬁed  on 
B  is  an  equivalence  of  categories. 

Proof.  Let F ∗  be  the presheaf deﬁned  by  taking F (U )  to be  the  limit  of  the diagram  formed 
by  the F (V )  (and  the  restriction maps)  for al l  basic  opens V  contained  in U .  If U  is  a basic 
open,  then  the  construction  comes  with  a  map  F ∗ (U )  � F (U )  which  deﬁnes  a  morphism 
of  presheaves  speciﬁed  on  B .  Also,  the  limit  property  also  deﬁnes  the  restriction  maps 
ResU,V  : F ∗ (U ) � F ∗ (V )  whenever  V  → U  are  arbitrary  opens,  since  F ∗ (U )  maps  to  F (W ) 
for  any  basic  open  W  contained  in  V .  By  a  similar  argument,  any  morphism  F  � G  of 
presheaves  induces  a morphism  F ∗  � G ∗ . 
What  is  left  to  check  that  on  one  hand  the  map  F ∗ (U ) � F (U )  is  an  isomorphism,  and 
on  the  other  hand  F ∗  satisﬁes  the  sheaf  axiom.  We  leave  these  as  exercises. 

As  a  corollary,  we  learn  how  to  glue  sheaves  together. 

Corollary.  Let  I  be  an  index  set  and  let  {Ui}i�I  be  an  open  cover  of  X .  Suppose  we  are 
given  the  fol lowing  data. 

(a)  For  each  i ∅ I ,  a  sheaf  Fi  on  Ui  with  values  in  C .


�

(b)  For  each	 i, j  ∅  I ,  an  isomorphism  �ij  :  Fi |Ui�Uj  =  Fj |Ui�Uj ,  satisfying  the  fol lowing 
conditions. 

(i)  For  each  i ∅ I ,  �ii  is  the  identity  morphism  on  Fi . 
(ii)  For each i, j, k ∅ I , we have �j k ∩ �ij  = �ik  as morphisms of sheaves on Ui ∼ Uj ∼ Uk . 
(This  is  cal led  the  cocycle  condition,  for  reasons  to  be  discussed  later.) 

�
Then  there  exist  a  sheaf  F  on  X  and  isomorphisms  �i  : F |Ui  = Fi  for  each  i ∅ I ,  such  that 
for  each  i, j  ∅ I ,  �ij  ∩ �i  = �j .  Moreover,  F  is  unique  up  to  unique  isomorphism  (in  a  sense 
to  be  interpreted  by  the  reader). 

You might describe  this by  saying  that “a  sheaf  of  sheaves  is  a  sheaf.”  In  fact,  this  is  the 
same  sort  of  data  needed  to  glue,  say,  topological  spaces. 

Proof.  Suppose  we  are  in  the  happy  situation  where  whenever  an  open  set  U  of  X  belongs 
to  both  Vi  and  Vj ,  we  have  a  literal  equality  Fi(U ) = Fj (U )  and  the map  �ij  between  these 
two  is  the  identity morphism.  (Note  that  the  cocycle  condition  is  automatically  valid  here.) 
Then  we  can  apply  the  basis  lemma,  where  B  is  the  (nice)  basis  consisting  of  those  open 
sets  U  contained  in  Ui  for  at  least  one  index  i. 
The  trouble  is  that  as  usual,  ob jects  in  a  category  are  usually  not  equal.  However, 
using  the  cocycle  condition  we  can  force  them  to  become  equal  as  follows.  Deﬁne  a  functor 
F  :  B  � C  as  follows.  For  U  ∅  B ,  pick  an  index  i  =  i(U )  such  that  U  →  Ui ,  and  put 
F (U ) = Fi (U ).  For an inclusion V  → U  of elements  of B , put i = i(U ) and j  = i(V ),  so that 
V  is  contained  in  both  Ui  and  Uj .  Deﬁne  ResU,V (F )  as  the  composition  of  the  restriction 
map ResU,V (Fi ) : Fi (U ) � Fi(V ) with  the map  �ij  : Fi (V ) � Fj (V ).  The  cocycle  condition 

4


then  implies  that these  restriction maps are associative,  so they deﬁne a presheaf F  speciﬁed 
on B .  The  fact  that  each Fi  is  a  sheaf  implies  that F  is  a  sheaf  speciﬁed  on B ,  so  it  extends 
to  a  sheaf. 

4  Stalks 

An  important  source  of  information  about  sheaves  is  given  by  looking  at  their  behavior  “in 
the  neighborhood  of  a  point”,  as  follows. 
First let us recall something about direct limits.  (Warning:  I had the terminology slightly 
wrong when I introduced this in the category theory lecture.  The notes have been corrected.) 
A directed  set  is a partially ordered set  in which any two elements have an upper bound (but 
not  necessarily  a  least  upper  bound).  A  direct  system  in  a  category  C  is  a  covariant  functor 
F  :  P  � C  with  P  a  directed  set.  If  the  colimit  exists,  it  is  called  the  direct  limit  of  the 
system. 
Before  using  this  notion  for  much,  it  might  be  helpful  to  make  it  explicit  in  the  case  of 
sets.  (The  case  of  abelian  groups,  which  we  also  use,  works  the  same  way.)  In  this  case,  the 
direct  limit  is  formed by  starting with  the union of F (S ) over  all S  ∅ P ,  then  identifying  the 
elements  x ∅ F (S )  and  y  ∅ F (T )  if  there  exist  arrows  f  : S  � U  and  g  : T  � U  in  P  such 
that  F (f )(x) = F (g )(y ).  A  typical  example  is  the  formation  of  the  fraction  ﬁeld  Frac(R)  of 
an  integral  domain  R,  as  the  direct  limit  of  the  rings  R[x]/(xf  − 1)  over  all  nonzero  f  ∅ R. 
Here  the  poset  is  the  nonzero  elements  of  R  ordered  under  divisibily,  and  the  map  from 
R[x]/(xf  − 1)  to R[x]/(xf g − 1)  takes  x  to  xg . 
Now  let  F  be  a  presheaf  on  the  topological  space  X ,  and  let  x ∅ X  be  any  point.  View 
the  open  subsets  of  X  containing  x  as  a  partially  ordered  set  Px  under  reverse  inclusion. 
They  then  form  a  directed  set,  and  the  direct  limit  of  the  functor  F  :  Px  � C  is  called  the 
stalk  of F ,  denoted  Fx . 
The  elements  of a  stalk  (which  exist  because we  assumed  (E)) are  typically  called  germs. 
If  s  is  a  section  of  a  sheaf  on  an  open  set  containing  x,  we  write  sx  for  the  germ  of  s  at  x. 
Example:  the  stalk  of  the  sheaf  of  real-valued  continuous  functions  consists  of  germs  of 
real-valued  continuous  functions.  Two  continuous  functions  deﬁned  on  open  subsets  of  X 
containing a point x determine  the  same germ at x  if and only  if they  coincide on  some open 
subset  containing  x. 
We  can  make  a  similar  construction  for  the  other  “functions  on  manifolds”  examples 
above.  Beware  that  in  these  examples,  the  germ  of  a  function  at  a  point  carries  much  more 
information  than  the  value  at  that  point.  Extreme  example:  two  holomorphic  functions 
deﬁned  on  a  connected  complex  manifold  have  the  same  germ  at  a  single  point  if  and  only 
if  they  coincide  (because  of  analytic  continuation!). 
One variant we’ll need a bit later:  given any  subset Z  of X , not necessarily a single point, 
we  can  similarly  take  the  direct  limit  of  F (U )  over  all  open  subsets  U  of  X  containing  Z . 
We  call  this  the  stalk  of  X  at  Z .

5  Stalks  and  morphisms 

Stalks  can  be  used  to  detect  lots  of  interesting  properties  of  sheaves,  particularly  in  relation 
to  morphisms.  Throughout  this  section,  let  �  :  F1  � F2  be  a  morphism  of  sheaves  on  a 
topological  space  X . 

Lemma.  Consider  the  fol lowing  conditions. 

(a)  For  each  x ∅ X ,  the  map  �x  : F1,x  � F2,x  is  injective/surjective/bijective. 

(b)  For each open subset U  of X , the map �(U ) : F1 (U ) � F2 (U ) is injective/surjective/bijective. 
Then  (b)  implies  (a)  in  al l  cases,  while  (a)  implies  (b)  in  the  injective  and  bijective  cases. 

Proof.  Suppose  (a).  Let  Yi  be  the  product  of  Fi,x  over  all  x  ∅  U .  Then  the  sheaf  axiom 
implies  that  the  map  Fi(U ) �  Yi  carrying  s  to  �x sx  is  injective.  This  gives  injectivity  in 
(b).  (This  is  a  toy  example  of  the  construction  of  the  espace  ´etale  of  a  sheaf;  I  asked  more 
about  it  on  Problem  Set  1.) 
If  �x  is  bijective  for  all  x,  then  for  any  section  t  ∅ F2 (U )  and  any  x  ∅  U ,  there  is  an 
open  neigborhood  V  = Vx  of  x  on which  t  coincides  with  the  image  under  �  of  some  section 
sx  ∅ F1 (Vx).  For y ∅ U  also, the restrictions of sx  and sy  to F1 (Vx ∼ Vy ) have the same  image 
under  �  (namely  the  restriction  of  t  to F2 (Vx  ∼ Vy )),  so  they  coincide  by  what  we  proved  in 
the  previous  paragraph.  We  can  thus  invoke  the  sheaf  axiom  to  assemble  s  ∅ F1 (U )  with 
�(s) = t.  so  surjectivity/bijectivity  in  (b)  is  an  easy  consequence. 
Suppose  (b).  The  surjectivity  aspect  is  more  or  less  obvious,  so  we  only  check  the 
injectivity  aspect.  Suppose  we  are  given  two  elements  of  F1,x  with  the  same  image  in  F2,x . 
We  can  represent  these  by  sections  s1 , s2  of F1  on  some  open neighborhood  of x.  In  fact, we 
can  take  them  on  the  same  open  neighborhood  U .  Their  images  are  sections  of  F2  which 
have  the  same  image  in  F2,x .  That  means  that  we  can  replace  U  by  some  smaller  open 
neighborhood  V  so  that  �(s1 )  and  �(s2 )  coincide  in  F2 (V ).  But  then  s1  =  s2  in  F1 (V ),  so 
(a)  holds. 

We  deﬁne  a  morphism  of  sheaves  to  be  injective/surjective/bijective  if  it  has  the  cor­
responding  property  on  stalks.  By  the  previous  lemma,  bijective  is  the  same  as  being  an 
isomorphism  (in  the  sense  of  having  an  inverse). 
The  disturbing  thing  is  of  course  the  failure  of  the  implication  from  (a)  to  (b)  in  the 
surjectivity  case.  Yes,  a  morphism  of  sheaves  can  be  surjective  without  being  surjective  on 
sections!  What  is  true  is:  if  �  is  surjective  and  U  is  an  open  in X ,  then  for  each  s ∅ F2 (U ), 
we  can  cover  U  with  open  subsets  Vi  such  that  ResU,Vi (s)  is  in  the  image  of  �(Vi)  for  each 
i.  The  trouble  is  that  you  may  not  be  able  to  choose  elements  of  the  F1 (Vi )  which  can  be 
glued. 
Here  is  a  familiar  example.  Put  X  =  C  \ {0}.  Let  F1  be  the  sheaf  of  holomorphic 
functions  on X .  Let F2  be  the  sheaf  of nowhere  vanishing  holomorphic  functions  on X .  Let 
�  :  F1  � F2  be  the  map  taking  f  :  U  �  C  to  exp ∩f .  Then  �  is  surjective  because  the 
logarithm  of  a  nonzero  holomorphic  function  exists  local ly,  but  not  globally:  the  function 
z  ∅ F2 (X )  is  not  in  the  image  of  �(X ).

6  Sheaﬁﬁcation 

If  we  ﬁx  a  topological  space  X  and  a  category  C ,  there  is  an  obvious  forgetful  functor  from 
sheaves  on X  with  values  in C  to presheaves  on X  with values  in C .  If you properly  digested 
the  notion  of  an  adjoint  functor,  you  should  be  asking  whether  this  forgetful  functor  occurs 
as  the  right  adjoint  in  an  adjoint  pair.  It  does! 
Let  F  : X  � C  be  a  presheaf  on  X  with  values  in  C .  Deﬁne  another  presheaf  F +  on  X 
as  follows.  For U  → X  open,  take F +(U )  to be  the  subset  of � Fx  consisting  of elements 
x�U 
sx  with  the  following  property:  for  each  x  ∅  U ,  there  exists  an  open  neighborhood 
s = 
�
x 
V  of  x  in  U  and  a  section  t  ∅ F (V )  such  that  sy  =  ty  for  all  y  ∅  V .  From  the  deﬁnition, 
it  is  easy  to  check  that F +  is  a  sheaf  and  that  its  stalk  Fx 
+  is  canonically  isomorphic  to Fx . 
We  call  F +  the  sheaﬁﬁcation  of F ;  its  construction  is  functorial  in  F . 

Proposition.  The functor F  ⊆� F +  from presheaves on X  to sheaves on X , and the forgetful 
functor  from  sheaves  on  X  to  presheaves  on  X ,  form  an  adjoint  pair. 

Proof.  Exercise. 

7  Direct  and  inverse  image 

Let  f  : X  � Y  be  a  continuous  map.  For F  a  sheaf  on X ,  the  formula 

(f�F )(V ) = F (f −1(V )) 

obviously  deﬁnes  a  sheaf  f�F  on  Y .  It  is  called  the  direct  image  of F . 
−1G  on  X  as  follows:  for  U  open  in  X , 
Now  let  G  be  a  sheaf  on  Y .  Deﬁne  a  presheaf  f−
−1G )(U )  be  the  stalk  of  G  at  f (U ),  i.e.,  the  direct  limit  of  G (V )  over  open  sets  V  → X 
let  (f−
containing  f (U ).  This  is  general  not  a  sheaf;  its  sheaﬁﬁcation  is  called  the  inverse  image  of 
G ,  denoted  f −1G . 

Proposition.  The  functors  f −1  and  f�  form  an  adjoint  pair. 

Proof.  Exercise. 

You might wonder why I didn’t use the notation f �  for the inverse  image.  That is because 
I will need that notation later for a diﬀerent functor, deﬁned for a morphism of ringed spaces. 
Using  the  inverse  image,  we  can  deﬁne  the  restriction  of  F  to  an  arbitrary  subset  Z  of 
X , as  the sheaf  i−1F  for i  : Z  � X  the  inclusion map  (with Z  given  the  subspace  topology). 
If  Z  = {x},  this  coincides  with  the  stalk  Fx  (exercise).
