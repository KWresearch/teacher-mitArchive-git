Pro jective  morphisms,  part  1  (updated  3  Mar  08) 

We  now  describe  pro jective  morphisms,  starting  over  an  aﬃne  base. 

1  Pro j  of  a  graded  ring 

The  construction  of Pro j  of  a graded  ring  was  assigned  as  an  exercise;  let  me  now  recall  the 
result  of  that  exercise. 
⊕∞ 
Let  S  = 
n=0Sn  be  a  graded  ring,  i.e.,  a  ring  such  that  each  Sn  is  closed  under  addition, 
and  SmSn  ⊆  Sm+n .  An  element  of  Sn  is  said  to  be  homogeneous  of  degree  n;  the  elements  of 
S0  form  a  subring  of  S ,  and  each  Sn  is  an  S0 -module.  (One  could also  deﬁne  a  graded  ring 
to  allow  negative  degrees;  on  the  few  occasions  where  I’ll  need  that  construction,  I’ll  call  it 
a  graded  ring  with  negative  degrees.)  Let  S +  denote the ideal  ⊕∞ 
n=1Sn . 
Let Pro j S  be  the  set  of  all  homogeneous  prime  ideals  of  S  not  containing  S+ .  For  each 
positive integer  n  and  each  f  ∈  Sn ,  we  may  view  the  localization  Sf  as  a  graded  ring  with 
negative degrees, by placing  g/f k  in degree  m − kn  whenever  g  ∈  Sm .  We  may  then  identify 
the  set 

D(f ) =  {p ∈  Pro j S  :  f /∈  p} 

with Spec  Sf ,0 ,  where  Sf ,0  is  the  degree  zero  subring  of  Sf .  These  glue  to  equip  Pro j S  with 
the  structure  of  a  scheme (note that  D(f ) ∩ D(g ) =  D(f g )).  In  the  case  S  =  A[x0 , . . . , xn ] 
where  each  of  x0 , . . . , xn  is  homogeneous  of  degree  1,  this  simply  produces  the  pro jective 
space  Pn 
A . 
Any  morphism  S  →  T  of  graded  rings  induces  a  morphism  Pro j T  →  Pro j S  of  schemes. 
For  example,  we  say  an  ideal  I  of  S  is  homogeneous  if  as  abelian  groups  we  have 

I  =  ⊕∞ 
n=0 (I  ∩ Sn ). 

In  other  words,  if  we  split  each  element  of  I  into homogeneous components, the components 
themselves  belong  to  I .  Then  S/I  may  also  be  viewed  as  a  graded  ring,  the  pro jection 
S  →  S/I  induces  a  morphism  Pro j S/I  →  Pro j S ,  and  this  morphism  is  a  closed  immersion 
(as  we  see  immediately  by checking  on  a  D(f )). 
Beware  that  the  scheme  Pro j S  does  not  by  itself  determine  the  graded  ring  S .  For 
instance,  omitting  S1  gives  another graded  ring  with  the same Pro j.  We’ll  come back  to this 
point later. 
⊕∞ 
n=−∞  is  a  graded  S -module, i.e.,  SmMn  ⊆  Mm+n  for  all  m, n,
More generally, if  M  = 
we  can  convert  M  into  a  quasicoherent  sheaf  M˜ on  Pro j S  by  doing  so  on  each  D(f ) (using 
the  degree-zero  subset  of  Mf ) and  then  glueing.  For  a  converse,  see  below.

2  The  sheaf  O(1) 

For  S  a  graded  ring,  n  a  nonnegative  integer,  and  M  a graded  S -module, let  M (n) denote 
the  shifted  module 

M (n)i  =  Mn+i . 

Let  OX (n)  be  the  quasicoherent  sheaf  on  X  = Pro j S  deﬁned  by  the  graded  module  S (n). 
In particular,  OX (0) =  OX .  More  generally,  for  any  quasicoherent  sheaf  F  of  OX -modules, 
put  F (n) =  F ⊗OX  OX (n). 

Lemma.  Suppose  that  S  is  generated  by  S1  as  an  S0 -algebra.  Then  the  sheaves  OX (n) 
on  Pro j S  are  local ly  free  of  rank  1,  and  OX (m) ⊗OX  OX (n)  is  canonical ly  isomorphic  to 
OX (m  +  n). 

Proof.  See Hartshorne, Proposition II.5.12. 

Note:  a  quasicoherent  sheaf  F  on  a  locally  ringed  space  X  which  is  locally  free  of  rank 
1  is  also  called  an  invertible  sheaf.  That  is  because  there  is  a  unique  sheaf  F ∨  such  that 
F ⊗OX  F ∨  ∼ OX , the  dual  of  X  (exercise). 
In this case, the dual  of  OX (n) is in fact OX (−n). 
= 
This gives us an explanation for what x0 , . . . , xn  are on the pro jective space Pro j A[x0 , . . . , xn ]: 
they  are  global  sections  not  of  the  sheaf  OX ,  but  rather  of  the  sheaf  OX (1). 

Theorem  1.  Suppose that  S  is  ﬁnitely  generated  by  S1  as  an  S0 -algebra.  Then  each  quasi-
coherent  sheaf  on  Pro j S  can  be  written  as  M˜ for  a  canonical  choice  of  M . 

The  ﬁnitely  generated  hypothesis  is  needed  to  ensure  that  Pro j S  is  quasicompact;  we 
will  impose  it  pretty  consistently  hereafter. 

Proof.  Let  F  be  a  quasicoherent  sheaf  on  M .  Then  the  module  we  want  is 

where 

Γ∗ (F ) =  ⊕n∈ZΓ(X, F (n)), 

F (n) =  F ⊗OX  OX (n). 

For  the  rest  of  the  proof,  see  Hartshorne,  Proposition  II.5.15. 

Beware  that  this  does  not  imply  that  S  =  ⊕∞ 
n=0Γ(X, OX (n))  in  general.  For  a  stupid 
example, take  S  =  A[x], in which case the sheaves  OX (n) are all free and  so Γ(X, OX (n)) 6
0= 
even  when  n <  0.  For  less  stupid  examples,  see  Hartshorne  exercise  II.5.14.  However,  the 
following  is true. 

Lemma.  Let  n  ≥  1  be  an  integer.  For  S  =  A[x0 , . . . , xn ]  with the  usual grading (by total 
degree),  we  have 

S  =  ⊕∞ 
n=0Γ(X, OX (n)). 

Proof.  Exercise,  or  see  Hartshorne  Proposition  II.5.13.

3  Closed  subschemes  of  pro jective  spaces 

Proposition.  For  n  ≥  1,  any  closed  immersion  into  Pn  is  deﬁned  by  some  homogeneous 
A 
ideal  of  A[x0 , . . . , xn ]. 

Proof.  In fact, there is a canonical way  to pick  out the ideal.  Let I  be the ideal  sheaf deﬁning 
the  closed  immersion;  then  Γ∗(I ) is  an  ideal  of  Γ∗(OX ),  but  we  already identiﬁed  the  latter 
with  S  =  A[x0 , . . . , xn ].  (This  identiﬁcation  uses  the  fact  that S  is  ﬁnitely  generated  by  S1 
as  an  S0 -algebra,  in  order  to  invoke  the  previous  theorem.  In  fact,  it  is  part  of  the  proof  of 
that  theorem;  see  Hartshorne  Proposition  II.5.13.) 

In general, there may be multiple homogeneous ideals deﬁning  the same closed  subscheme 
of  Pn 
If  we  start  with  an  ideal  I ,  pass  to  the  closed  subscheme,  then  use  the  previous 
A . 
proposition  to  get  back,  we  get  the  saturation  of  I ,  namely,  the  set  of  all  elements  f  ∈ 
A[x0 , . . . , xn ] such  that  xj 
0f , . . . , xj
n f  ∈  I  for  some  nonnegative  integer  j .  We  thus  obtain  a 
one-to-one  correspondence  between  closed  subschemes  of  Pn  and  saturated  (equal  to  their 
A 
saturation)  homogeneous ideals. 

Corollary.  For  n  ≥  1, let  I  be  a  homogeneous  ideal  of  S  =  A[x0 , . . . , xn ].  The  fol lowing 
conditions  are  equivalent. 

(a)  The  subscheme  of  Pn  deﬁned by  I  is  empty. 
A 

(b)  The  saturation  of  I  equals  S + . 

(c)  For  some  n0 ,  we  have  Sn  ⊆  I  for  al l  n  ≥  n0 . 

Proof.  We just proved the equivalence  of (a)  and (b).  It is clear that (c)  implies (b).  Let 
us  check  that  (b)  implies  (c).  Given  (b),  each  f  ∈ {x0 , . . . , xn}  has  the  property  that 
xj 
n f  ∈  I  for  some  j .  In  particular,  we  have  xj 
0f , . . . , xj
0 , . . . , xj
n  ∈  I  for  some  j .  This  in  turn 
implies  S(n+1)(j−1)+1  ⊆  I  since  each  monomial  of degree (n  + 1)(j − 1) + 1 is divisible by  one

4  Pro jective  implies  proper 

:  Pn 
Z  →  Spec Z  is  proper.  Recall  that 
We  are  now  ready  to  complete  the  proof  that  f 
the  missing  step  was  to  show  that  f  is  universally  closed,  i.e.,  for  any  scheme  X ,  the  map 
Pn  →  X  is  closed.  It  is  enough  to  do  this  in  case  X  = Spec A  is  aﬃne.  Moreover,  we  may 
X 
assume  n  ≥  1,  as  the  case  n  = 0 is  stupid (because  f  is  an  isomorphism). 
Let  Z  be a closed  subset  of  Pn
X , suppose  z  ∈  X  is not in the image of Z , and put  k  =  κ(z). 
We  must  exhibit  an  open  neighborhood  U  of  x  in  X  such  that  Z  ∩ Pn  =  ∅. Let  I  =  ⊕∞ 
n=0 In 
U
be  the  saturated  homogeneous  ideal  in  S  =  A[x0 , . . . , xn ] deﬁning  Z .  Then  I  ⊗A  k  deﬁnes 
the  empty  subscheme  of  Pro j k [x0 , . . . , xn ], but may  not be saturated.  Nonetheless, for some 
m,  we  have  that  In  ⊗A  k  =  Sn  ⊗A  k ,  and  so (Sn/In) ⊗A  k  = 0.

Since  Sn/In  is  a  ﬁnitely generated  A-module, by  Nakayama’s lemma, (Sn/In) ⊗A  Ap  = 0 
for  p  the  prime  ideal  of  A  deﬁning  z .  Again  since  Sn/In  is  ﬁnitely  generated,  we  have 
(Sn/In ) ⊗A  Ag  =  0  for  some  g  ∈  A \ p.  Then  z  ∈  D(g ) and  D(g ) is disjoint from the image 
of  Z ,  proving  the  claim. 

5  What  is  a  pro jective  morphism? 

Several authors (Hartshorne, Eisenbud-Harris) deﬁne a morphism  f  :  Y  →  X  to be  projective 
if  it  is  the  composition  of  a  closed  immersion  Y  →  Pn  with  the  pro jection  Pn  for  some 
X 
X
nonnegative integer  n.  This  deﬁnition  is  evidently  stable  under  base  change,  but  it  is  not 
local  on  the  base ! Better to say  that  such  a morphism is  global ly projective, and  to say  that  f 
is  local ly projective  if  each  x  ∈  X  admits an open neighborhood  U  such  that  f  :  Y  ×X U  →  U 
is globally pro jective. 
This  is  not  such  a  serious  distinction  in  practice,  as  globally  pro jective  equals  locally 
pro jective if X  is “not too large”.  For instance, this occurs if X  is itself global ly quasiprojective 
over  an  aﬃne  scheme. 
(A  morphism  is  global ly  quasiprojective 
if  it  factors  as  an  open 
immersion  followed  by  a  globally  pro jective  morphism.  Again,  this  is  stable  under  base 
change  but  not  local  on  the  base;  the  version  where  we  force  locality  on  the  base  is  a 
quasiprojective  morphism.) 
The  deﬁnition  of  projective  given in EGA is in fact  somewhere between locally  and glob­
ally pro jective.  More on that later.  (Warning: Eisenbud-Harris  claim that locally pro jective 
and  pro jective  are  the  same.  They  aren’t,  but  counterexamples  are  rather  pathological.)
