Schemes 

We next introduce locally ringed spaces, aﬃne schemes,  and general schemes.  References:

1  Ringed  and  locally  ringed  spaces 

A  ringed  space  is  a  topological  space  X  equipped  with  a  sheaf  OX  on  X  with  values  in 
Ring  (called  the  structure  sheaf ).  This  deﬁnition  isn’t  so  useful  because  it  doesn’t  force  the 
topology  to  have  much  to  do  with  the  ring  structure;  for  instance,  any  ring  can  be  viewed 
as  a  ringed  space  on  a  one-element  topological  space. 
A more  useful  notion  is  that  of  a  local ly  ringed  space.  This  is  a  ringed  space  in which  for 
each  x  ∪  X ,  the  stalk  OX,x  of  OX  at  x  is  a  local  ring,  i.e.,  a  ring  with  a  unique  maximal 
ideal  mX,x .  (The  zero  ring  is  not  a  local  ring!) 
For  example,  suppose X  is  a manifold  and  let OX  be  the  sheaf  of  real-valued  continuous 
functions.  We  check  that  (X, OX )  forms  a  locally  ringed  space.  Given  x  ∪  X ,  let  mX,x  be 
the  ideal  of  OX,x  consisting  of  germs  of  functions  taking  the  value  0  at  x.  This  is  clearly 
an  ideal,  and  the  quotient  OX,x/mX,x  is  certainly  contained  in  R.  Since  X  is  a  manifold, 
the  quotient  is  nonzero,  so  mX,x  is  indeed  a  maximal  ideal  of  OX,x .  To  check  that  it  is  the 
unique maximal  ideal,  it  suﬃces  to  check  that  any  f  ∪ OX,x  not  contained  in  mX,x  is  a  unit 
in OX,x .  For such an f , f (x) is some nonzero real number,  so we can ﬁnd an open subinterval 
I  ∩  R  such  that  f (x)  belongs  to  I  but  0  does  not.  Represent  f  by  a  continuous  function 
on  some  open  subset  U  of  X  containing  x,  which  I’ll  also  call  f .  The  key  point  is  that  by 
continuity,  V  =  f −1 (I )  is  again  an  open  subset  of  X  containing  x,  and  f  takes  nonzero 
values  everywhere  on  V .  Hence  there  exists  a  multiplicative  inverse  g  of  f  on  V ,  which  is 
necessarily  continuous. 
Similarly,  a  smooth  manifold,  complex  manifold,  or  abstract  algebraic  variety  equipped 
with  the  obvious  sheaf  is  a  locally  ringed  space. 
For  any  x  ∪  X ,  the  quotient  OX,x/mX,x  is  a  ﬁeld.  We  denote  it  by  �(x)  and  call  it  the 
residue  ﬁeld  of  x.  In  the  aforementioned  examples,  the  residue  ﬁelds  of  all  of  the  points  of 
x  are  the  same  (either  R,  C,  or  a  prescribed  algebraically  closed  ﬁeld),  but  that  will  not  be 
the  case  for  schemes! 
I’ll talk about morphisms of (locally) ringed spaces  later.  For the moment,  let me at least 
point  out  that  an  isomorphism  of  (locally)  ringed  spaces  is  what  you  think:  a  homeomor­
phism  of  topological  spaces  and  corresponding  bijections  of  sections  which  commute  with 
restriction. 

2  The  prime  spectrum  of  a  ring 

The  notion  of  a  locally  ringed  space  is  a  suﬃciently  broad  generalization  of  manifolds  that 
it  admits  a  meaningful  functor  from  the  category  of  arbitrary  (commutative  unital)  rings.

This  gives  rise  to  the  concept  of  an  aﬃne  scheme;  to  deﬁne  this,  we  must  ﬁrst  recall  the 
construction  of  the  prime  spectrum  of  a  ring.  See  the  exercises  for  lots  of  examples. 
Let  R  be  an  arbitrary  ring.  Following  Zariski,  we  deﬁne  the  prime  spectrum  of  R, 
denoted  Spec(R),  to  be  the  set  of  prime  ideals  of  R.  (An  ideal  p  of  R  is  prime  if  R/p 
is  an  integral  domain.  The  zero  ring  is  not  an  integral  domain,  so  the  trivial  ideal  is  not 
prime.)  For  a  general  ring,  this  is  a  better  idea  than  using  only  maximal  ideals  because  a 
ring  homomorphism  �  : R � S  induces  a map  Spec(S ) � Spec(R)  taking  p ∩ S  to  �−1 (p). 
(The  latter  is  prime  because  �  induces  an  injective  map  R/�−1 (p) �  S/p,  so  the  source  is 
an  integral  domain.)  By  contrast,  �  may  not  carry  maximal  ideals  of  S  to  maximal  ideals 
of R;  for  instance,  consider  � : Z � Q. 
Again  following Zariski, we  equip  the  set Spec(R) with  the Zariski  topology,  in which  the 
closed  sets  have  the  form 

V (I ) = {p ∪ Spec(R) : I  ∩ p} 

for  I  an  ideal  of R.  This  is  indeed  a  topology  because 

V (I ) → V (J ) = V (I ∼ J ) = V (I J ) 
 
 
 �
 
�
�
�
V (Ii ) = V
Ii 
i 
i
We  will  use  a  special  basis  of  open  sets  for  this  topology:  the  distinguished  open  sets,  of 
the  form 

. 

D(f ) = {p ∪ Spec(R) : f /∪ p} 

for  f  an  element  of  R.  Note  that  this  basis  is  nice  in  the  sense  that  the  intersection  of 
any  two  distinguished  opens  D(f )  and  D(g )  is  again  a  distinguished  open,  namely  D(f g ). 
Note  also  that  for  �  :  R  �  S  a  homomorphism,  the  induced  map  Spec(S )  �  Spec(R)  is 
continuous  because  the  inverse  image  of D(f )  is D(�(f )). 

Lemma.  Any  distinguished  open  D(f )  of  Spec(R)  is  quasicompact  for  the  Zariski  topology. 
In  particular,  Spec(R) = D(1)  itself  is  quasicompact. 

Proof.  It  is enough  to prove  that any covering  of D(f ) by distinguished  open  subsets  admits 
a  ﬁnite  subcover.  If  the  sets  D(fi )  cover  D(f )  (for  i  running  over  some  arbitrary  index 
set),  then  the  radical  of  (f )  is  contained  in  the  radical  of  the  ideal  generated  by  the  f i .  In 
particular,  some  power  of  f  is  in  the  ideal  generated  by  the  fi .  But  that means  that we  can 
write  f  as  a  ﬁnite  R-linear  combination  of  the  fi ,  so  those D(fi )  already  cover  D(f ). 

For  example,  if  k  is  an  algebraically  closed  ﬁeld,  then  Spec k [x]  consists  of  one  point  of 
the  form  (x − a)  for  each  a  ∪  k ,  plus  a  point  corresponding  to  the  prime  ideal  (0).  The 
latter  is  an  example  of  a  generic  point,  a  point  whose  closure  is  equal  to  the  entire  space  in 
question.  For  the  analogous  picture  of  Spec k [x, y ],  see  Hartshorne  Example  2.3.4.

3  A  presheaf  of  rings 

We  now  specify  a  presheaf  of  rings  on  X  =  Spec(R),  but  only  on  the  distinguished  open 
subsets.  To  do  this,  we  must  do  a  bit  of  work  to  clean  up  their  description,  to  account  for 
the  fact  that  prime  ideals  don’t  see  the  diﬀerence  between  an  element  of  a  ring  and  a  power 
of  that  element. 

Lemma.  For  f , g  ∪ R,  we  have  D(f ) ∩ D(g )  if  and  only  if  some  power  of  f  is  a  multiple 
of  g . 
Proof.  Note  that  D(f ) =  D(f n )  for  any  positive  integer  n.  Hence  if  f n  is  a  multiple  of  g 
for  some  n,  then  D(f ) =  D(f n )  is  contained  in  D(g ).  Conversely,  suppose  D(f )  ∩  D(g ), 
or  in  other  words,  V (g ) ∩  V (f ).  Recall  that  the  radical  of  the  ideal  (g )  is  the  intersection 
of  the  prime  ideals  containing  (g ).  Since  V (g )  ∩  V (f ),  it  follows  that  the  radical  of  (f )  is 
contained  in  the  radical of (g ),  so  in particular f  belongs  to  the  radical  of (g ).  That  is,  some 
power  of  f  is  a multiple  of  g ,  as  desired. 

A  multiplicative  subset  of  R  is  a  subset  closed  under  multiplication.  For  example,  Sf  = 
{1, f , f 2 , f 3 , . . . }  is  a multiplicative  subset.  A multiplicative  subset  S  is  saturated  if  for  any 
x  ∪  R  such  that  some  power  of  x  equals  an  element  of  S  times  a  unit,  we  have  in  fact 
x  ∪  S .  For  any  multiplicative  subset  S  of  R,  there  is  a  unique  saturated  multiplicative 
subset  S˜ containing  it,  formed  in  the  obvious  fashon.  By  the  previous  lemma,  we  now  have 
the  following. 
Corollary.  For  f , g ∪ R,  we  have  D(f ) = D(g )  if  and  only  if  S˜f  = S˜g . 
Given  any  multiplicative  subset  S  of  R,  there  is  a  unique  initial  ob ject  among  the  R-
algebras  in  which  each  element  of  S  has  a multiplicative  inverse.  It  is  called  the  localization 
of  R  at  S ,  denoted  S −1R.  We  can  construct  it  as  the  polynomial  ring  in  one  variable  xf 
for  each  f  ∪  S ,  modulo  the  relations  xf f  − 1.  Note  that  there  is  a  canonical  isomorphism 
S˜−1R  �=  S −1R  since  they  both  satisfy  the  same  universal  property.  In  particular,  we  can 
write 

S˜−1R �= R[x]/(xf  − 1).
f 
From  now  on,  write  Rf  instead  of  S˜
−1R. 
f 
Let D  be  the  set  of distinguished  open  subsets  of X  = Spec R.  Deﬁne  a presheaf  of  rings 
OX  on X  speciﬁed  on D  as  follows.  First  put 

OX (D(f )) = Rf ; 

this is well-deﬁned by the previous corollary.  Then note that given an inclusion D(g ) ∩ D(f ), 
we  have Rf  ∩ Rg ,  so  the  universal  property  of  localization  gives  a  canonical  homomorphism 
Rf  � Rg .  If you want  to write  this more  concretely  (but  less  canonically),  apply  the  lemma 
above  to write  f n  = gh  for  some  positive  integer  n,  identify OX (D(f )) = R[x]/(xf − 1)  and 
OX (D(g )) = R[y ]/(yg − 1),  and  take  the  R-algebra  homomorphism 

R[x]/(xf  − 1) � R[y ]/(yg − 1),

x  ⊆� f n−1hy .

4  The  fundamental  theorem  of  aﬃne  schemes 

We  are  now  ready  to  prove  what  I  call  the  fundamental  theorem  of  aﬃne  schemes.  I  don’t 
know  whether  its  appearance  in  EGA  1  is  its  ﬁrst. 
Theorem  1.  The  presheaf  OX  on  X  =  Spec R  speciﬁed  on  D  satisﬁes  the  sheaf  axiom 
for  coverings  of  distinguished  opens  by  other  distinguished  opens.  Consequently,  it  extends 
uniquely  to  a  sheaf  of  rings  on  Spec R. 
While  we’re  at  it,  though,  we  may  as  well  prove  something  stronger  which  we  will  need 
later.  This proof is basically  the same one used to compute the regular functions on an aﬃne 
algebraic  variety.  It  may  also  be  thought  of  as  an  enhancement  of  the  Chinese  remainder 
theorem;  indeed,  the  latter  is  an  immediate  corollary  (exercise). 
Theorem  2.  Let M  be  an  R-module.  Deﬁne  a  presheaf  M˜ of  abelian  groups  on  X  speciﬁed 
on  D  by  the  formula  D(f )  ⊆�  M  �R  Rf .  Then  M˜ satisﬁes  the  sheaf  axiom  for  coverings 
of  distinguished  opens  by  other  distinguished  opens.  Consequently,  it  extends  uniquely  to  a 
sheaf  on  Spec R. 
Proof.  By  replacing  R  with  Rf ,  we  may  reduce  to  checking  the  sheaf  axiom  for  a  cover 
of  X  itself  by  some  distinguished  open  subsets  D(fi).  We  ﬁrst  verify  that  the  map  M  � 
 
M  �R  Rfi  is  injective,  as  follows.  Suppose  m  ∪  M  belongs  to  the  kernel  of  this  map. 
�
i 
Then  the  annihilator  of  m  is  an  ideal  of  R  which  cannot  be  contained  in  any  prime  ideal  p 
of R,  or  else we  would  have  p ∪ D(fi )  for  some  i,  and  the  image  of m  in M �R Rfi  would  be 
nonzero.  Thus  1 · m = 0,  so m = 0. 
This  proves  the  ﬁrst  half  of  the  sheaf  axiom;  we  must  now  check  the  glueing  property. 
For  this,  we  remember  that  X  is  quasicompact,  so  we  may  reduce  to  checking  for  a  ﬁnite 
cover.  Say  D(f1 ), . . . , D(fn )  cover  X .  Suppose  that  some  D(fi )  cover  D(f ),  and  that  we 
hj  have  the  same  image 
hi  and  mj /fj
hi  ∪ M  �R  Rfi  such  that  mi /fi
are  given  elements  mi/fi
in  Rfi fj .  Since  there  are  only  ﬁnitely  many  fi ,  we  may  take  the  nonnegative  integers  hi  to 
be  equal  to  a  common  value  h.  For  each  i, j ,  we  then  have 
h mj  − fj
h mi ) = 0 
(fi fj )gij (fi
for  some  nonnegative  integers  gij .  By  rechoosing  the  mi ,  we  can  force  gij  =  0  for  all  i, j , 
that  is,  we  now  have  literal  equalities 

h mj  = fj
h mi . 
fi
h  generate  the  unit  ideal.  We  may 
h)  again  cover  X ,  so  the  fi
h) = D(fi ),  the  D(fi
Since  D(fi
h  + · · · + gnfn
h  = 1.  Put 
now  pick  g1 , . . . , gn  ∪ R  such  that  g1f1 
m = g1m1  + · · · + gnmn . 

We  then  have

�

h  for  each  i.  This  completes  the  proof  of  the 
so  m  is  an  element  of  M  restricting  to  mi /fi
glueing  property,  so  we  are  done. 

h m =

h gjmj  =

5  Schemes 

From  now  on,  we  view  X  =  Spec(R)  as  a  ringed  space  with  structure  sheaf  OX  as  deﬁned 
above.  Note  that  for  any  prime  ideal  p  of R,  the  stalk OX,p  is  canonically  isomorphic  to  the 
local  ring Rp  (the  localization  of R  at  the multiplicative  set R \ p).  Hence  Spec(R)  is  in  fact 
a  local ly  ringed  space. 
At  this  point,  we  make  schemes  out  of  prime  spectra  by  glueing,  just  as  we  would  make 
manifolds  out  of  open  subspaces  of Rn .  We  deﬁne  an  aﬃne  scheme  to  be  any  locally  ringed 
space X  isomorphic to Spec(R)  for some ring R; note that the ring R  is uniquely determined 
by  the  fact  that 

�(Spec(R), OSpec(R) ) = R 
(from  the  previous  theorem).  A  scheme  is  a  locally  ringed  space  in which  each  point  has  an 
open  neighborhood  isomorphic  to  an  aﬃne  scheme. 
Warning:  if  X  =  Spec(R)  is  an  aﬃne  scheme,  each  distinguished  open  subset  D(f )  is 
an  aﬃne  scheme,  namely  Spec(Rf )  (exercise).  By  construction,  these  form  a  basis  of  open 
sets.  However,  it  is  possible  for  there  to  be  an  open  subset  U  of  X  such  that  (U, OX |U )  is 
isomorphic  to  an  aﬃne  scheme  but  U  is  not  distinguished.  (Counterexample  to  appear  as 
an  exercise.) 

6  Schemes  by  glueing 

We  often  specify  nonaﬃne  schemes  using  glueing  data.  For  instance,  if  X1  and  X2  are  two 
schemes  admitting open subsets U1 , U2  which are  isomorphic as  locally ringed spaces, we can 
glue  along  this  isomorphism  to  get  a  third  scheme  X .  For more  than  two  schemes,  though, 
we  must  add  a  cocycle  condition  to  keep  the  glueing  maps  consistent.  Here  is  how  that 
works. 
Let us ﬁrst  specify  glueing data  for  sets.  Let  (Xi )i�I  be a collection  of  sets.  For each pair 
(i, j ) ∪ I × I ,  let Uij  be an open subset  of Xi , and  suppose  that Uii  = Xi .  Let �ij  : Uij  � Uj i 
be an isomorphism, and suppose that �ii  =  idXi .  Suppose also that for i, j, k ∪ I , �ij  restricts 
to  an  isomorphism  of  Uij  ∼ Uik  with  Uj i  ∼ Uj k ,  and  the  cocycle  condition 

�ik  = �j k  ⊂ �ij 

= �−1
holds  on  Uij  ∼ Uik .  (In  particular,  �j i 
ij  .) 
We  would  like  to  identify  the  Xi  with  subsets  of  a  single  set  X  in  such  a  way  that  Uij 
identiﬁes  with Xi  ∼ Xj  and  �ij  identiﬁes  with  the  identity map  on Xi  ∼ Xj .  To  do  this,  ﬁrst 
 
form  the  disjoint  union  X �  = 
i�I  Xi .  Then  deﬁne  a  binary  relation  on  X �  as  follows:  for 
�
xi  ∪ Xi  and xj  ∪ Xj , we  say  that xi  � xj  if xi  ∪ Uij , xj  ∪ Uj i ,  and �ij (xi ) = xj .  The  glueing 
conditions  guarantee  that  this  is  an  equivalence  relation,  so  we may  form  the  quotient  X  of 
X �  by  �;  this  gives  the  desired  glueing.  (Exercise:  reformulate  this  deﬁnition  in  terms  of  a 
limit  construction.) 
We  next  specify  glueing  data  for  topological  spaces.  Set  notation  as  above,  except  that 
each  Uij  must  be  an  open  subset  of Xi ,  and  each  �ij  must  be  a  homeomorphism.  Using  the 

5


glueing  construction  for  sets,  identify  the  Xi  with  subsets  of  a  single  set  X .  We  may  then 
use  the  topologies  on  the Xi  as  a  basis  for  a  topology  on X ;  in  particular, Xi  is  open  in X . 
We must  still  check,  however,  that  the  given  topology  on Xi  coincides  with  the  subspace 
topology  from  X  (it  is  only  obvious  that  the  subspace  topology  is  ﬁner).  Suppose  x i  ∪  Xi 
and  V  is  an  open  neighborhood  of xi  in X .  There  then  exists  some  j  such  that  xi  ∪ Xj  and 
V  contains an open neighborhood of xi  for the topology on Xj .  Since xi  ∪ Xi ∼ Xj  = Uj i  and 
the  latter  is  open  in Xj ,  V  ∼ Uj i  also  contains  an  open  neighborhood  of  xi  for  the  topology 
on Xj .  Since  �ij  is  a  homeomorphism,  V  ∼ Uj i  = V  ∼ Uij  contains  an  open  neighborhood  of 
xi  for  the  topology  on Xi .  This  proves  the  claim. 
We  next  specify  glueing  data  for  (local ly)  ringed  spaces.  Set  notation  as  above,  except 
that  each  Xi  now  carries  a  structure  sheaf  OXi ,  and  each  �ij  is  an  isomorphism  of  (locally) 
ringed  spaces.  Using  the  glueing  construction  for  topological  spaces,  identify  the  X i  with 
open  subsets  of  a  single  topological  space  X .  By  the  glueing  property  for  sheaves,  we  now 
obtain a  sheaf  of  rings OX ,  so X  may be viewed  as a  ringed  space.  Moreover,  for x ∪ Xi , we 
have  a  canonical  identiﬁcation  of OX,x  with OXi ,x ;  hence  if  each Xi  is  a  locally  ringed  space, 
so  is X . 
We  ﬁnally  specify  glueing data  for  schemes.  This  is  the  easy  part:  set notation  as  above, 
except  that  each  Xi  is  a  scheme.  Then  it  is  evident  that  X  is  also  locally  isomorphic  to  an 
aﬃne  scheme,  so X  is  a  scheme!  (This  part  also  works  for manifolds  and  the  like.) 

7  Examples  of  glueing 

Glueing  can  be  a  force  for  both  good  and  evil.  Let’s  start  with  good. 
Start  with  any  ring  R.  For  i = 0, . . . , n,  put 

Xi  = Spec R[x0 /xi , . . . , xi−1/xi , xi+1/xi , . . . , xn /xi ]. 

Deﬁne  the  distinguished  open  subset 

Uij  = D(xj /xi ) ⊗ Xi . 

Then  there  is  an  obvious  isomorphism  of  Uij  with  Uj i  given  by  identifying  xk /xi  with 
(xk /xj )(xj /xi ).  It  is  easy  to  check  that  the  cocycle  condition  is  satisﬁed,  so we  get  a  scheme 
Pn ,  the  projective  space  over  R.  (An  alternate  construction  of  pro jective  space  uses  graded 
R
rings.  More  on  this  later.) 
Now  for  the  evil.  Let  k  be  an  algebraically  closed  ﬁeld.  Let X1  and X2  be  two  copies  of 
Spec k [x].  We  may  glue  these  on  the  open  sets  obtained  by  removing  the  point  x =  0  (i.e., 
the  distinguished  opens  D(x))  to  get  a  rather  unpleasant  ob ject;  it  is  a  line  with  a  doubled 
point. 
We  would  like  to  formulate  a  condition  that  rules  out  such  pathologies.  In  topology, 
the  Hausdorﬀ  condition  does  the  job,  but  that  won’t  work  for  schemes.  We  need  a  more 
category-theoretical  notion,  which  will  be  provided  once  we  deﬁne  separatedness.
