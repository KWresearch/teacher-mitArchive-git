More  on  abelian  sheaves 

We  now  specialize  the  discussion  of  sheaves  to  the  situation  where  the  target  category 
consists  of  abelian  groups.  At  the  end,  I’ll  explain  how  to  generalize  to  the  case  of  a  target 
which  is  an  abelian  category. 

1  Abelian  groups 

Assume  until  I  say  otherwise  that  C  =  Ab.  (At  the  end,  we’ll  generalize  to  the  case  where 
C  can  be  any  abelian  category.)  Let  me  ﬁrst  set  some  notation  and  terminology  about 
morphisms  of  abelian  groups  themselves. 
For  f  :  A  →  B  a  morphism  of  abelian  groups, 

ker(f ) =  {x  ∈  A  :  f (x) = 0} 
im(f ) =  {f (x) :  x  ∈  A} 
coker(f ) =  A/ im(f ) =  {y + im(f ) :  y  ∈  B}. 

A (ﬁnite  or  inﬁnite)  sequence 

in Ab  is  exact  if  for  each  i, 

·  ·  ·  →  Ai−1  →  Ai  →  Ai+1  →  · · · 

im(Ai−1  →  Ai ) = ker(Ai+1  →  Ai ). 

If  we  only  have  the  weaker  assertion  that 

im(Ai−1  →  Ai ) ⊆  ker(Ai+1  →  Ai ) 

(i.e.,  the  composition  Ai−1  →  Ai  →  Ai+1  is  zero)  for  each  i,  we  say  that  the  sequence  is  a 
complex. 
Here  are  some  useful  facts  about  exact  sequences;  their  proofs  are  fun  exercises  in  what 
is  sometimes  called  diagram  chasing. Remember that in Ab, monomorphism equals injective 
and  epimorphism  equals  surjective  (so  mono  plus  epi  equals  iso,  which  is  not  true  in  an 
arbitrary  category).

(a)  If	 f1  and  f3  are  monomorphisms  and  f0  is  an  epimorphism,  then  f2  is  a  monomor­
phism. 

(b)  If  f1  and  f3  are  epimorphisms  and  f4  is  a monomorphism,  then  f2  is  an  epimorphism. 

Proof.  Exercise.

be  a  short  exact  sequence.  Then  there  exists  a  canonical  homomorphism  δ 
coker(f1 ) (the  connecting  homomorphism)  such  that 

:  ker(f3 )  → 

δ
0  →  ker(f1 ) →  ker(f2 ) →  ker(f3) →  coker(f1 ) →  coker(f2 ) →  coker(f3) →  0 

is  exact,  where  al l  the  maps  other  than  δ  are  the  obvious  ones  induced  by  the  diagram. 

Proof.  Here  is  what  δ  is  supposed  to  be:  given  a3  ∈  ker(f3), lift it to a2  ∈  A2 ,  then  apply  f2 
to get  b2  ∈  B2 .  Since  the  diagram  commutes,  b2  must  map  to  zero  in  B3 ,  so  it  lifts  to  b1  in 
B1 . Declare  δ(a3) =  b1 . 
It  remains  to  show  that  δ  is  well-deﬁned  and  is  a  homomorphism,  and  that  the  claimed 
sequence  is  exact.  These  are  left  as  exercises.

be  a  commuting  diagram  in  C  with  exact  rows.  Then  f2  is  a  monomorphism/epimorphism  if 
and  only  if  f1  and  f3  both  are. 

2  Exact  functors 

For  C1  =  C2  =  Ab,  a  covariant  functor  F  :  C1  → C2  is  additive  if  it  commutes  with  addition 
of  morphisms.  Any  additive functor  sends  complexes to  complexes (because the property  of 
the  composition  of  two  maps  being  zero  is  preserved),  but  not  necessarily  exact  sequences 
to  exact  sequences.  Hence  the  following  deﬁnitions. 
We  say  F  is  left  exact  if  for  any  exact  sequence 

0  →  A1  →  A2  →  A3

the  sequence 

is  exact.  We  say  F  is  right  exact  if  for  any  exact  sequence 

0  →  F (A1) →  F (A2 ) →  F (A3 ) 

the  sequence 

A1  →  A2  →  A3  →  0 

F (A1 ) →  F (A2) →  F (A3) →  0 

is exact.  We say  F  is  exact  if it is both left  exact  and  right  exact;  equivalently, for any  exact 
sequence 

the  sequence 

0  →  A1  →  A2  →  A3  →  0 

0  →  F (A1 ) →  F (A2 ) →  F (A3) →  0 

It  in  turn  implies  that  any  exact  sequence  of  any  length  goes  into  another  exact  sequence 
under  F . 
(I’ll  try  avoid  using  these  notions  for  contravariant  functors,  since  there  is  a 
left/right  ambiguity.) 
Examples: 

•  For  any  given  X  ∈ C ,  the  covariant  functor  Hom(X, ·) is  left  exact. 

•  For  any  given  X  ∈ C ,  the  covariant  functor  X  ⊗ ·  is  right  exact. 

Many  left/right  exact  functors  arise  from  the  following  proposition. 

Proposition.  Suppose  the  covariant  functors  f ∗  :  C1  → C2  and  f∗  :  C2  → C1  form  an  adjoint 
pair.  Then  f ∗  is  right  exact  and  f∗  is  left  exact. 

Proof.  Exercise. 

3  Abelian  sheaves 

Let  F  be  a  sheaf  on  a  topological  space  X  with  values  in  C  = Ab.  A  subsheaf  of  F  is  what 
you  think:  take  a  subset  of  the  sections  on  each  open  so  that  you  still  have  a  sheaf.  The 
quotient  of  F  by  a  subsheaf  G  is  a  bit  trickier:  take  the  presheaf  U 
7→ F (U )/G (U ),  then 
sheaﬁfy.  Note  that  the  stalk  at  x  is indeed  Fx/Gx . 
Given  a  morphism  φ  :  F  → G  of  sheaves,  the  presheaf  U 
7→  ker(φ(U )) is  a  sheaf;  we  call 
it the  kernel  of  φ.  The  presheaves  U 
7→  coker(φ(U )) are  not  in  general 
7→  im(φ(U )) and  U 
sheaves;  their  sheaﬁﬁcations  are  called  the  image  and  cokernel  of  φ. 

Proposition.  For  x  ∈  X ,  we  have  ker(φ)x  = ker(φx ),  im(φ)x  = im(φx),  and  coker(φ)x  = 
coker(φx ).  Consequently, 

im(φ) ∼=  F / ker(φ), 

coker(φ) ∼ G / im(φ).

Proof.  Exercise. 

Using  these,  we  extend  the  notion  of  exactness  to  a  sequence  of   sheaves;  it’s  equivalent 
to  deﬁne  it  using  sheaves  or  stalks,  but  not  using  sections. 
Let  ShC (X )  be  the  category  of  sheaves  on  X  with  values  in  C .  We  deﬁne  the  global 
sections  functor  Γ(·, X ) : ShC (X ) → C  by  the formula 

Γ(F , X ) =  F (X ). 

(No  set-theoretic  diﬃculties  here:  X  is  a  small  category,  so  sheaves  on  X  with  values  in  C 
do  form  a  class.) 

Proposition.  The  global  sections  functor  is  left  exact. 

Proof.  Exercise. 

The  failure  of  the  global  sections  functor  to  be  right  exact  will  give  rise  to  the  notion  of 
sheaf  cohomology  later. 

4  Abelian  categories 

Everything I deﬁned  above can be generalized  to the case where  C  is what is called  an  abelian 
category,  i.e.,  a  category  which  captures  the  useful  properties  of  abelian  groups. 
First,  let  me  give  an  ad  hoc  deﬁnition  which  will  suﬃce for  our purposes.  A  nice  abelian 
category  is an additive category in which all limits and  colimits exist, together with  a forgetful 
functor  to  Ab  which  preserves  limits  and  colimits. 
Next,  let’s  ﬁgure  out  what  the  correct  abstract  deﬁnition  shoul  be.  We  ﬁrst  write  down 
the  deﬁnition  of  an  preadditive  category  (which  I called  an  additive  category  by  mistake  on 
Problem  Set  1).  That  is  a  category  C  equipped  with  the  structure  of  an  abelian  group  on 
each  set  Hom(X, Y ),  over  which composition  is  distributive. 
We next deﬁne an additive category. The key  notion is that direct  sum and direct product 
coincide  for  a  ﬁnite  collection  of  abelian  groups.  We  should  thus  require  the  existence  of 
biproducts :  that  is,  for  any  X1 , . . . , Xn  ∈  Ob j(C ),  there  must  exist  an  ob ject  X  equipped 
with  maps  πi  :  X  →  Xi  and  ιi  :  Xi  →  X ,  such  that  X  is both  a product (using  the  πi ) and 
a coproduct (using  the  ιi ),  and the  sum  ι1 ◦ π1 + · · ·  + ιn  ◦ πn  is  the  identity  on  X . (Exercise: 
this  exists  as  soon  as  you  have  ﬁnite  products.) 
Since the empty biproduct exists, an additive category  has a terminal (initial  and  ﬁnal) 
ob ject,  which  we  call  the  zero  object  and  label  0.  In  an  additive  category,  we  can  deﬁne  a 
kernel  of  the  morphism  f  :  X  →  Y  to  be  a  limit  of  the  diagram

i.e.,  an  ob ject  W  plus  a  morphism  g  :  W  →  X  such  that  f  ◦ g  = 0,  and  any  other  morphism 
h  :  V  →  X  for  which  f  ◦  h  =  0  factors  uniquely  through  g .  Similarly,  a  cokernel  of  f  is  a 
colimit  of

To get  a  preabelian  category,  we  insist  that  every  morphism  admit  a  kernel  and  cokernel 
(which as  usual  are  only  unique  up  to  unique  isomorphism).  To  get  an  abelian  category,  we 
insist that  every  monomorphism be the kernel  of its cokernel,  and  every  epimorphism be the 
cokernel  of  its  kernel. 
The  Freyd-Mitchel l  embedding  theorem  asserts  that  at  least  for  every  smal l  abelian  cat­
:  C →  ModR  for  a  not 
egory  C ,  we  can  construct  an  exact  and  fully  faithful  functor  F 
necessarily  commutative  ring  R  (where ModR  now  means  left  modules).  This lets you prove 
theorems  about  abelian  categories  by  reducing  to  situations  where  ob jects  really  do  have 
elements. 
The  main  diﬀerence  between  my  nice  abelian  categories  and  true  abelian  categories  is 
that  I  want  al l  limits  and  colimits to  exist.  This is  a bit  strong  for  some purposes, but  since 
I  need  limits  anyway  to  work  with  sheaves,  it’s  not  so  strange. 
Anyway,  the  point  here  is  that  if  you  start  with  a  (nice)  abelian  category  C ,  for  any 
topological  space  X ,  the  category  Sh C (X ) is  again a (nice) abelian category.  This follows by 
assembling  various  homework  exercises.
