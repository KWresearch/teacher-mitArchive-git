´ Etale  cohomology (updated 13 May 09) 

In  this  lecture,  we  give  a  hint  of  the  theory  of  ´etale  cohomology.  Standard  references:

Etale Cohomology ; Freitag-Kiehl, 
Etale  Cohomology  and  the  Weil 
Conjectures.  You  might  want  to  read  Hartshorne  Appendix  C  ﬁrst  for  an  overview.  Also, 
note  that  there  is  a  “rogue”  volume  of  SGA  called  SGA 4 1/2,  written  mostly  by  Deligne 
after the fact,  which gives  a  surprisingly legible (albeit in French)  account  of  this  stuﬀ. 
Since  this  is  the  last  lecture  of  the  course,  I  would  like  to  take  the  opportunity  to  thank 
you,  the  participants,  for  all  the  hard  work  you  put  in  on  the  problem  sets,  and  especially 
for  all  your  feedback  on  the  notes.  If  you  have  further  questions  about  algebraic  geometry, 
from  the  general  to  the  speciﬁc,  I  would  be  happy  to  discuss  them! 

1  Motivation:  the  Weil  conjectures 

Let  X  be  a  variety  over  a  ﬁnite  ﬁeld  Fq . Weil predicted  that the  zeta function  of  X , deﬁned 
as  an  Euler  product 

ζX (T ) =  �(1 − T deg(x→Fq ) )−1 
x 
over  the  closed  points  of  X ,  could  always  be  interpreted  as  the  power  series  expansion  of  a 
rational function of  T ; this analogizes the analytic continuation of the Riemann zeta function. 
For instance, for  X  =  P1 , 

1 
(1 − T )(1 − qT ) 
Weil  also  predicted  analogues  of  the  functional  equation  of  the  zeta  function,  and  the  Rie­
mann  hypothesis.  For  instance,  for  X  an  elliptic  curve,  Hasse  proved  that 
1 − aT  +  qT 2 
(1 − T )(1 − qT ) 
for  some  a  ∈ Z.  This  expression  has  the  symmetry  property  that 
ζX (q −1/T ) =  ζX (T ). 

ζX (T ) = 

ζX (T ) = 

. 

(This  example  is  a  bit  lucky;  more  generally,  you  might  be  oﬀ  by  a  factor  of  q aT b  for  some 
a, b  ∈ Z.  For  X  of pure dimension  n,  you  should  compare  ζX (T ) with  ζX (q−n/T ).)  Hasse 
also proved that 
|a| ≤ 2√q , 
or  equivalently,  the  numerator  polynomial  1  − aT  +  qT 2  has  complex  roots  of  norm  q−1/2 . 
Weil  also  noticed  that  the  degrees  of  the  factors  in  the  zeta  function  appeared  to  have 
topological  meaning.  Namely,  if  X  is  obtained  from  a  smooth  proper  scheme  over  some 

1 

arithmetic  ring  (i.e.,  a  localization  of  the  ring  of  integers  in  a  number  ﬁeld)  by  reduction 
modulo  a  prime,  then  the  degrees  of  the  factors  in  ζX (T ) correspond  to  the  Betti  numbers 
of (X  × C)an .  For  example,  the  degrees  of  the  factors  1  − T , 1  − aT  +  qT 2 , 1  − qT  in  the 
elliptic  curve  case  match  the  Betti  numbers  1, 2, 1  of  a  genus  1  Riemann  surface. 
Weil proved  analogues  of  all these  assertions for  arbitrary  curves,  and (based  on  some 
evidence from Fermat hypersurfaces)  conjectured  analogues for higher dimensional  varieties. 
More  precisely,  he  predicted  the  existence  of  a  cohomology  theory  H i( )  for  varieties  over 
·
Fq ,  taking  values  in  ﬁnite  dimensional  vector  spaces  over  a  ﬁeld  K  of  characteristic  zero,  in 
which  the  number  of  Fq -rational points (i.e., the  ﬁxed points of  the  q -power  Frobenius  map) 
could  be  computed  using  an  analogue  of  the  Lefschetz  ﬁxed  point  formula  in  topology: 

2 dim(X ) 
 
(−1)i Trace(F , H i(X )).
#X (Fqn ) =  �
n
q 
i=0 

This  immediately  implies  rationality  of  ζX (T ).  Symmetry  should  follow  from  a  form  of 
Poincar´e  duality,  i.e.,  a  perfect  pairing 

H i (X ) × H 2 dim(X )−i (X ) H 2 dim(X ) (X ) K.

The  Riemann  hypothesis  is  not  quite  as  purely  formal  a  consequence,  since  it  is  basically  a 
nonnegativity  condition,  whereas  K  need  not  have  anything  to  do  with  R.  But  never  mind 
that  for  now. 

2  Curves 

For  curves,  Weil  proved  his  conjectures  by  constructing  an  algebraic  group  associated  to  a 
curve  C ,  called  the  Jacobian  variety  J (C ).  Over  C,  this  gives  a  complex  torus  which  had 
been  constructed  by  Abel-Jacobi  using  abelian  integrals. 
For  a  prime  ℓ  not  equal  to  the  characteristic  of  Fq ,  and  a  positive  integer  n,  the  group 
J (C )(Fq )[ℓn ] of  geometric  ℓn -torsion points is  abstractly isomorphic to (Z/ℓnZ)2g , for  g  the 
genus  of  C . The  absolute Galois group  of  Fq  acts by (Z/ℓnZ)-module  endomorphisms.  If  we 
take  the  inverse  limit  over  n,  we  get  a  Zℓ -module  Tℓ (J (C )) equipped  with  an  action  of  the 
absolute Galois group;  it is  nowadays  called  the  Tate  module  of  C . (For instance, if C  is  an 
elliptic  curve,  then  J (C ) =  C .) 
This gives the  H 1  (or really its dual) in a good cohomology  theory.  The symmetry  comes 
from  the  Tate  pairing.  The  Riemann  hypothesis  can  be  deduced  using  the  Hodge  index 
theorem, which gives a nonnegativity (or really  a nonpositivity)  assertion for the intersection 
pairing  on  C  ×Fq  C . 
Aside:  a  noncohomological  proof,  using  only  Riemann-Roch  and  some  clever  estimates, 
was  found  later  by  Stepanov  (and  simpliﬁed  by  Bombieri).  Good  reference:  Lorenzini’s 
Invitation to Arithmetic Geometry.

3  Why  ´etale? 

One  might  think  that  coherent  sheaf  cohomology,  as  we  have  developed  in  this  course, 
might  be  useful  against  the  Weil  conjectures.  However,  it  has  several  problems:  it  lives  in 
characteristic  p rather than characteristic 0 (so it  can only  aspire to prove rationality  mod  p, 
rather  than  integrally),  and  its  dimensions  do  not  match  Betti  numbers.  For  instance,  sheaf 
cohomology  on  a  scheme  of  dimension  n  only  goes  up  to  index  n,  rather  than  2n. 
Grothendieck  realized  that  one  might  get  around  this  by  trying  to  make  an  analogue  of 
topological  cohomology  in  which  ´etale  maps  play  the  role  of  local  homeomorphisms.  For 
instance,  recall  one  of  the  consequences  of  GAGA:  for  a  smooth  proper  variety  X  over  C, 
every  ﬁnite  covering  space  map  comes  from  a  unique  ﬁnite  ´etale  cover  of  X .  Thus  the 
proﬁnite  completion  of  the  topological  fundamental  group  can  be  recovered  as  an  inverse 
limit of Galois groups of  these  ´etale covers. 
Perhaps  a  better  justiﬁcation  for  considering  ´etale  covers  is  the  following.  For  X  a 
complex  analytic  variety  and  x  ∈ X ,  the  local  ring  OX,x ,  while  not  complete,  is  henselian : 
the  conclusion  of  Hensel’s  lemma  still  holds.  (That  is,  given  a  polynomial  over  OX,x ,  any 
simple  root  of  the  reduction  modulo  the  maximal  ideal  lifts  uniquely  to  a  root.)  This  is 
not  true  for  schemes,  though.  A  related  geometric  statement  is  that  if  f  :  Y
X  is  an 
→
´etale  morphism  of  schemes,  and  x  ∈ X  is  a  point,  then  there  is  no  way  to  draw  disjoint 
open  neighborhoods  of  the  points  of  f −1(x),  so  you  cannot  view  the  ´etale  map  as  a  local 
homeomorphism. 

4  Topology  revisited 

In  order  to  combine  the  ideas  about  ´etale  covers  with  sheaf  cohomology,  Grothendieck  had 
to  take  the  apparently  drastic  step  of  modifying  the  notion  of  a  topology  on  a  space.  But 
in  retrospect,  this  isn’t  such  a  strange  modiﬁcation  to  make.  After  all,  presheaves  on  a 
topological  space  X  are nothing  more than contravariant functors on the category  X  of  open 
sets.  Why  not  state  all  the  sheaf  axioms  in  terms  of  the  structure  of  that  category? 
Grothendieck  realized  that  stating  the  sheaf  axiom  really  only  requires  knowing  what 
an  open  cover  is,  leading  to  the  following  deﬁnition.  Let  C be  a  category  admitting  ﬁbre 
products.  A  Grothendieck  topology  consists  of  the  following  data.  For  each  X  ∈ C , you  must 
tell  me  which  collections  of  morphisms  {Ui  → X }i∈I  are  coverings  of  X .  This  prescription 
must  satisfy  some  hypotheses. 

Any  isomorphism  X

•	 For  any  Y  →  X , if  {Ui  →  X } is  a  cover,  then  {Ui  ×X  Y  →  Y } is  a  cover.  That  is,

is  by  itself  a  cover  of  Y .

•	 If  {Ui  → X } is  a  cover,  and  for  each  i  {Vij  → Ui} is  a  cover,  then  {Vij  → X } is  also  a 
cover.  That  is,  covering  each  open  in  a  cover  gives  a  cover. 

3


(Strictly speaking,  this  is  a  Grothendieck pretopology  because it  only gives you the  analogue 
of  a  basis  for  a  topology.  You  should  really  throw  in  all  coverings  “generated”  by  these  too.) 
A  category  equipped  with  a  Grothendieck  topology  is  called  a  site. For instance, the  big 
´etale  site  of  a scheme  S  is the category  of  all  S -schemes,  in  which  coverings  are  collections  of 
´etale  morphisms  which  form  a  set-theoretic  cover.  That  is,  {Ui  → X } is  a  cover  if  and  only 
if  each  Ui  is  ´etale  and  the  union  of  their  images  is  X .  (If  you  only  bother  keeping  ob jects 
which  are  themselves  ´etale  over  S , you get the  smal l  ´etale  site.) 
There  are  many  other  useful  Grothendieck  topologies  that  occur  frequently  in  algebraic 
geometry.  These  include  the  fppf  topology  (ﬁd`element plat de pr´esentation  ﬁnie  = faithfully 
ﬂat  of  ﬁnite  presentation),  the  fpqc  topology  (ﬁd`element  plat  et  quasicompact  =  faithfully 
ﬂat  quasicompact),  the  smooth  topology,  the  ﬂat  topology,  the  syntomic  topology  (ﬂat  and 
locally  of  ﬁnite presentation), the  Nisnevich  topology  (´etale, but  each point  must be  covered 
by  a point  with  the  same  residue  ﬁeld),  etc.  There  are  also  useful  examples  where  you  start 
with  a  usual  topological  space  but  use  only  some  of  the  available  open  covers;  this  occurs  in 
the  deﬁnition  of  rigid  analytic  spaces  (i.e.,  analytic  spaces  over  a nonarchimedean  complete 
ﬁeld like  Qp ). 
Anyway,  once  you  know  what  a  Grothendieck  topology  is,  you  can  deﬁne  a  sheaf  of 
abelian groups (say)  on it.  Namely, you  want  a  contravariant functor  F  from  your  category 
to  Ab,  such  that  for  any  cover  {Ui  → X },  we  have  an  exact  sequence 
 
 
F (Ui ) �
F (X ) �
0 
→
→
→
F (Ui  ×X  Uj )
i 
i,j 

where  the  last  map  computes  a  section  on  F (Ui ×X  Uj ) as  the  restriction  from  Ui  minus the 
restriction from  Uj .  For  instance,  in  most  reasonable  cases,  the  structure  sheaf  F (X ) =  OX 
is  a  sheaf. 
There  is  also  a  notion  of  sheaﬁﬁcation  but  this  is  complicated  by  the  fact  that  we  don’t 
have  points  with  with  to  deﬁne  stalks.  No  matter:  what  are  points  anyway  but  decreasing 
families  of  open  sets?  One  can  make  an  artiﬁcial  deﬁnition  of  “points”  in  that  fashion;  this 
brings one dangerously close to the notion of  a  topos, which I  will  skip  over entirely.  (Roughly 
speaking,  a  topos  is  the  category  of  sheaves  on  a  site  with  values  in  a  given  category,  like 
sets  or  abelian  groups.)

5  Etale  cohomology  in  practice 

We  can  now  deﬁne  sheaf  cohomology  on  any  site  with  a  ﬁnal  ob ject  as  the  derived  functors 
of global  sections,  meaning  sections over the  ﬁnal  ob ject.  (One can  ﬁx this even if there is no 
ﬁnal  ob ject, by  taking  a compatible family  of  sections over  every  element  of  the site.  Yeesh.) 
However,  it’s  not  so  straightforward  to  compute  ´etale  cohomology  of  a  scheme  X  with 
coeﬃcients  in  a  sheaf  F .  On  one  hand,  writing  down  ´etale  cochains  is  not  a  problem:  you 
specify  an  ´etale  cover  of  X  and  then  some  sections  on  each  element  of  the  cover.  Writing 
down  cocycles  isn’t  that  much  harder:  you  have  to  write  down  another  ´etale  cover  on  which 

4


you  can  check  that  the  diﬀerential  of  your  cochain  vanishes.  The  hard  part  is,  given  a 
cochain,  how  do  you  tell  whether  it  is  zero  or  not? 
Despite  this  complication,  one  can  prove  quite  a  lot.  For  instance,  if  you  start  with  a 
quasicoherent  sheaf  F on  a  scheme  X ,  you  get  a  sheaf  on  its  big  and  small  ´etale  sites  by 
setting  the  sections  over  an  open  i  :  U
→
X  to  be  i∗ F .  But  this  is  a  boring  example, 
because  the  resulting  sheaf  cohomology  turns  out  to  agree  with  usual  sheaf  cohomology  on 
the  “Zariski  site”  (i.e., what we already know). 
What  makes  the  ´etale  site  fun  is  that  you  get  strange  new  sheaves,  much  more  akin 
to  the  locally  constant  sheaves  in  topology,  and  their  cohomology  is  quite  interesting.  For 
instance, you can make a locally constant  sheaf  associated to any (pro)ﬁnite abelian group (by 
sheaﬁfying  the  constant  presheaf ),  and  this  gives  you  something  with  topological  meaning. 

Theorem.  Let  X  be  a  smooth proper  scheme  over  C. Then for  any prime  ℓ,  the  cohomology 
of  the  ´etale  local ly  constant  sheaf  associated  to  the  ℓ-adic integers  Zℓ  computes the topological 
Betti  numbers  of  X . 

The  fun  comes  when  you  start  with  a  scheme  over  an  arithmetic  base,  like  Q.  If  you 
extend  the  base  to  Q  and  then  take  ´etale  cohomology  with  coeﬃcients  in  Zℓ ,  the  result 
carries  an  action  of  the  absolute Galois group  of  Q.  E.g.,  for  an  elliptic  curve,  the  ﬁrst  ´etale 
cohomology  is (dual  to)  the  ℓ-adic  Tate  module,  i.e.,  the  inverse  limit  of  the  ℓ-power torsion 
groups  viewed  as  a  Galois  representation. 

6  Back  to  the  Weil  conjectures 

Let  X  be  a  smooth  proper  scheme  over  the  ﬁnite  ﬁeld  Fq .  Pick  any  prime  ℓ  =  q .  For  each 
positive integer n, we can consider the locally  constant  ´etale sheaf  Z/ℓnZ  on  X . Let  ZℓX  be 
X 
the  inverse  limit  of  these;  this  is  not  the  same  as  the  locally  constant  ´etale  sheaf  generated 
by  Zℓ . (E.g., in the example  of the elliptic  curve, that is because the  ℓ∞ -power torsion is not 
deﬁned  over  a  ﬁnite  extension  of  the  base  ﬁeld.) 
Nonetheless,  Zℓ  is  a  good  sheaf  to  work  with.  (It  is  an  example  of a  sheaf  which  is  lisse, 
or  smooth  if you prefer to translate from the French.)  We  will be interested in  working  with 
the 

H i (X ) = 

H i
et (X  ×Fq  Fq , Zℓ ) ⊗Zℓ  Qℓ , 
which  is  a  collection  of  Qℓ -vector  spaces.  These  turn  out  (with  some  eﬀort)  to  be  ﬁnite 
dimensional  over  Qℓ , and  carry  a Lefschetz trace formula.  This proves rationality  of  the zeta 
function. 
Aside:  rationality  had  already  been  proved  by  Dwork  around  1960  using  p-adic  analytic 
methods,  but  not  using  cohomology.  Nowadays,  though,  Dwork’s  proof  has  been  reinter­
preted  in  terms  of  a  diﬀerent  Weil  cohomology,  called  rigid  cohomology,  taking  values  in  a 
p-adic  ﬁeld.  (Remember  that  ℓ  =  p  is  excluded  in  ´etale  cohomology,  because  this  case  be­
haves badly.  For instance, an elliptic curve over an algebraically  closed  ﬁeld  of  characteristic 
p  has  at  most  p  points killed by  p,  not  p2 .)

Returning  to  ´etale  cohomology,  there  is  also  a  Poincar´e  duality  which  implies  symmetry. 
The  Riemann  hypothesis,  of  course,  is  more  subtle;  Grothendieck  had  predicted  it  would 
follow  from  a  suitable  analogue  of  the  Hodge  index  theorem,  which  was  one  of  his  standard 
conjectures. This  analogue is  still  open;  instead, Deligne proved  the Riemann hypothesis by 
a  rather  clever  combination  of  ideas,  including  an  algebro-geometric  variant  of  the  “Rankin 
squaring”  argument  from  classical  modular  forms.  Laumon  later  gave  a  similar  but  techni­
cally  simpler  proof  by  adding  the  use  of  a  cohomological  Fourier  transform. (These proofs 
are  largely  independent  of  which  Weil  cohomology  you  are  using.  In  particular,  with  some 
eﬀort  they  can  be  transposed  into  rigid  cohomology.)
