Diﬀerentials 

See  Hartshorne  II.8. 

1  The  module  of  K¨ahler  diﬀerentials 

Let  A  �  B  be  a  homomorphism  of  rings.  The  module  of  K¨ahler  diﬀerentials  of  B  over 
A  is  a  B -module  �B/A  equipped  with  an  A-linear  derivation  d  :  B  �  �B/A  (an  A-linear 
homomorphism  satisfying  the  Leibniz  rule  d(xy ) =  x dy  +  y dx  for  x, y  ⊗  B ;  note  that 
this  forces  d(a)  =  0  for  a  ⊗  A),  with  the  following  universal  property:  for  any  B -module 
M  and  any  A-linear  derivation  �  :  B  �  M ,  �  factors  uniquely  through  d  via  a  B -linear 
homomorphsism  �B/A  � M . 
There  are  two  standard ways  to construct �B/A .  One  is  to  form  the B -module  generated 
by  symbols  db  for  b ⊗ B ,  modulo  the  necessary  relations: 

(a)  d(b1b2 ) − b1  db2  − b2 db1  for  b1 , b2  ⊗ B ; 

(b)  d(b1  + b2 ) = d(b1 ) + d(b2 )  for  b1 , b2  ⊗ B ; 

(c)  d(a) = 0  for  a ⊗ A. 

This  obviously  has  the  desired  universal  property.  The  other  is  to  let  I  be  the  kernel  of 
the  multiplication  map  B �A  B  � B ,  and  put  �B/A  =  I /I 2  equipped  with  the  map  d(b) = 
b � 1 − 1 � b.  This  evidently  gives  an  A-linear  derivation.  Given  a  derivation  �  : B  � M , 
view  B � M  as  a B -algebra  in  by  setting m1m2  = 0  for  all m1 , m2  ⊗ M .  Then  the  formula 

b1  � b2  � (b1 b2 , b1� (b2 )) 

induces  a  ring  homomorphism  B �A  B  �  B � M  under  which  I  maps  to  M ,  so  I 2  maps 
to  0  and  we  get  a  B -linear  map  I /I 2  �  M .  Composing  with  d  easily  gives  back  � .  The 
uniqueness  of  the  factorization  follows  by  observing  that 

x � y = xy � 1 − x(y � 1 − 1 � y ) 

so  the  image  of  d  generates  I  (and  hence  I /I 2)  as  a B -module. 
For  instance,  if  B  =  A[x1 , . . . , xn ],  then  �B/A  is  freely  generated  by  dx1 , . . . , dxn .  Also, 
if  k  is  an  algebraically  closed  ﬁeld  and  A  is  a  reduced  quotient  of  k [x1 , . . . , xn ],  then  the 
Jacobian  criterion  can  be  interpreted  as  saying  that  A  corresponds  to  a  nonsingular  variety 
over  k  if  and  only  if  �A/k  is  locally  free  as  an  A-module. 
For  another  example,  if  A  is  a  ﬁeld  and  B  is  a  ﬁnite  ﬁeld  extension,  then  �B/A  = 0  if 
and  only  if B  is  separable  over  A.

2  The  sheaf  of  K¨ahler  diﬀerentials 

Let  f  :  Y  �  X  be  a  morphism.  For  each  open  aﬃne  subset  U  =  Spec(A)  of  X  and  each 
open  aﬃne  subset  V  =  Spec(B )  of  f −1 (U ),  form  the  module  �B/A .  We  would  like  these 
to  form  the  sections  of  a  sheaf  �Y /X ,  but  checking  the  glueing  property  directly  from  this 
deﬁnition  is  a  bit  awkward. 
Fortunately,  our  second  construction  of  the  module  of  K¨ahler  diﬀerentials  suggests  a 
global  deﬁnition  of  the  sheaf  �Y /X .  We’ll  explain  this  ﬁrst  in  case  f  is  separated.  In  that 
case,  �  :  Y  �  Y  ×X  Y  is  a  closed  immersion;  let  I  be  the  corresponding  ideal  sheaf  on 
Y  ×X  Y .  We  then  put 

�Y /X  = �� (I /I 2 ). 
But  what  if  f  is  not  separated?  In  that  case,  we  still  claim  that  �  is  an  immersion ;  this 
follows  from the proof of Hartshorne Corollary II.4.2.  Then � gives  rise to an ideal sheaf not 
on  Y  ×X  Y ,  but  on  some  open  subscheme  containing  the  image  of �;  we  may  then  proceed 
as  in  the  separated  case. 
Useful  properties  of  �: 

•	 The  formation of �Y /X  commutes with base change as  follows.  If g  : Z  � X  is another 
morphism,  then �Y ×X Z/Z  can be identiﬁed canonically with the pullback of �Y /X  along 
the  pro jection  Y  ×X  Z � Y  (Hartshorne,  Proposition  II.8.10). 

•	 If  f  : Z � Y  and  g  : Y  � X  are morphisms,  then  there  is  a  natural  exact  sequence 

f ��Y /X  � �Z/X  � �Z/Y  � 0 

(Hartshorne,  Proposition  II.8.11). 

•	 If  f  :  Y  �  X  is  a  morphism,  and  j  :  Z  �  Y  is  the  closed  immersion  deﬁned  by  the 
ideal  sheaf  I  on  Y ,  then  there  is  a  natural  exact  sequence  of  sheaves  on  Z : 

j � (I /I 2 ) � j � (�Y /X ) � �Z/X  � 0 

(Hartshorne,  Proposition  II.8.12). 

•	 Let  A  be  a  ring,  and  let  f  :  Y  =  P
then  have  a  short  exact  sequence 

n  �  X  =  Spec A  be  the  natural  morphism.  We 
A

0 � �Y /X  � OX (−1)∗(n+1)  � OY  � 0 

(Hartshorne,  Theorem  II.8.13). 

As  in the aﬃne case,  a variety X  over a ﬁeld k  is nonsingular  if and only  if �X/k  is  locally 
free.  Since  �X/k  is  necessarily  ﬁnitely  generated  (deduce  this  from  the  case  of  aﬃne  space), 
there  is  always  an  open  dense  subset  U  of X  which  is  nonsingular  over  k . 
Suppose  X  is  nonsingular  of  dimension  n  (on  each  component).  Then  we  call  the  sheaf 
�X/k  = →n�X/k  the  canonical  sheaf  on X ;  it  is  locally  free  of  rank  1.  As  the  name  suggests,

the  canonical  sheaf  is  an  omnipresent  ob ject  in  the  study  of  the  geometry  of  varieties;  we 
will  see  it  in  the  Riemann-Roch  theorem,  and more  generally  in  Serre  duality,  but  it  is  also 
a  central  player  in modern  birational  geometry,  as  in  the  following  very  hard  theorem. 
Theorem  (Bircar-Cascini-Hacon-McKernan,  Siu).  Let  X  be  a  smooth  projective  irreducible 
variety  over  C.  Then  the  ring 

 
�(X, ��n  )X/k

�

n=0 

is  ﬁnitely  generated  as  a  C-algebra. 

3  Smooth,  unramiﬁed,  and  ´etale  morphisms 

Let  f  :  Y  � X  be  a  morphism  of  schemes.  For  each  morphism  g  : X ∞  � X  with  X ∞  aﬃne, 
and each closed subscheme Z  of X ∞  deﬁned by a nilpotent ideal of O(X ∞ ), we have a canonical 
map 

HomX (X ∞ , Y ) � HomX (Z, Y ). 
If this map is always injective/surjective/bijective, we say that f  is formal ly unramiﬁed/smooth/´etale. 
We drop the “formally” if f  is also locally of ﬁnite presentation.  These properties have all the 
expected behaviors (local on the base,  stable under base change, descendable down  faithfully 
ﬂat  quasicompact  morphisms). 
The deﬁnition above  is given  in  terms of an  inﬁnitesimal  lifting  property.  There are more 
practical  characterizations  in  terms  of  diﬀerentials;  some  of  these  will  be  exercises.  (See 
EGA  IV,  part  4,  section  17.) 
Proposition.  The  morphism  f  is  formal ly  unramiﬁed  if  and  only  if  �Y /X  = 0. 
Proposition.  If  f  is  local ly  of  ﬁnite  presentation,  then  f  is  ´etale  if  and  only  if  f  is  ﬂat  and 
unramiﬁed. 
Proposition.  If  f  is  local ly  of  ﬁnite  presentation,  then  f  is  smooth  if  and  only  if  f  is  ﬂat 
and  for  each  x ⊗ X ,  the  ﬁbre  f −1 (x)  is  geometrically  regular  over  �(x).  (That  is,  for  k  an 
algebraic  closure  of  �(x),  f −1 (x) ×Spec �(x)  k  is  regular.) 
For  example,  the  pro jective  space  Pn  is  smooth  over  X .
X 
The  diﬀerence  between  regular  and  geometrically  regular  shows  up  only  when  the  ﬁeld 
�(x)  is  imperfect.  For  instance,  put  �  =  Fp (x),  X  =  Spec �  and  Y  =  Spec Fp (x1/p ) = 
Spec �[y ]/(y p  − x).  Then  Y  is  a  regular  scheme,  but  its  base  change  to  an  algebraic  closure 
k  of  �  is 

Spec k [y ]/(y p − x) = Spec k [y ]/((y − x 1/p )p ), 
which  is  not  regular.  For  a  slightly  less  trivial  example,  see  Hartshorne  exercise  III.10.1. 
The  notion  of  an  ´etale  morphism  is  an  algebro-geometric  analogue  of  the  concept  of  a 
covering  space  in  topology.  As  such,  it  forms  the basis  for one of  the most  successful  notions 
of  cohomology  in  algebraic  geometry,  that  of  ´etale  cohomology.  I  probably  won’t  have  time 
to  say  more  than  a  few  words  about  that  at  the  end  of  the  course.
