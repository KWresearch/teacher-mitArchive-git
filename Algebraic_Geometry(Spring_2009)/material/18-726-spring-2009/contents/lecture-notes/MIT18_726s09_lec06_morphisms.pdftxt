Morphisms  of  schemes  (updated  20  Feb  09) 

We  next  introduce  morphisms  of  locally  ringed  spaces  and  schemes.  Same  references  as 
the previous handout. 
Missing  remark  from  last  time:  when  EGA  was  written,  what  we  now  call  a  scheme  was 
called  a  prescheme.  EGA’s  “scheme”  is  what  we  will  call  a  separated  scheme. 

1  Direct  and  inverse  image 

To  deﬁne  morphisms  of  ringed  spaces,  I  need  the  direct  and  inverse  image  functors  for 
sheaves. 
I  had  these  on  a  previous  handout,  but  didn’t  discuss  them  in  class,  so  let  me 
review. 
Let  f  :  X  →  Y  be  a  continuous  map.  For  F  a  sheaf  on  X , the formula 

(f∗F )(V ) =  F (f −1(V )) 

obviously  deﬁnes  a  sheaf  f∗F  on  Y .  It  is  called  the  direct image  of  F . 
−1G  on  X  as  follows:  for  U  open in  X , 
Now let  G  be  a  sheaf  on  Y .  Deﬁne  a  presheaf  f−
−1G )(U ) be  the  stalk  of  G  at  f (U ),  i.e.,  the  direct  limit  of G (V ) over  open  sets  V  ⊆  X 
let (f−
containing  f (U ).  This  is  general  not  a  sheaf;  its  sheaﬁﬁcation  is  called  the  inverse image  of 
G , denoted  f −1G .  (The  notation f is  reserved  for  something  else;  see  below.) 
∗

Proposition.  The functors  f −1  and  f∗  form  an  adjoint  pair. 

Proof.  Exercise. 

Using  the  inverse  image,  we  can  deﬁne  the  restriction  of  F  to  an  arbitrary  subset  Z  of 
X , as the sheaf  i−1F  for  i  :  Z  →  X  the inclusion  map (with  Z  given the subspace topology). 
If  Z  =  {x},  this  coincides  with  the  stalk  Fx  (exercise). 

2  Morphisms  of  (locally)  ringed  spaces 

Let (X, OX )  and  (Y , OY  )  be  ringed  spaces.  A  morphism  of  ringed  spaces  from  X  to  Y 
:  X  →  Y  plus  a  homomorphism  f ♯  :  OY  →  f∗(OX )  of 
consists  of  a  continuous  map  f 
sheaves  of  rings  on  Y . 
For  example,  if  X  and  Y  are  manifolds,  then  f ♯  acts  as  follows.  Given  an  open  subset 
U  of  Y ,  we  must  specify  a  homomorphism  from  OY  (U ) to  f∗ (OX )(U ) =  OX (f −1(U )).  This 
homomorphism is pullback by  f ;  that  is,  it  takes  a  continuous  function  g  :  U  →  R  to  the 
continuous function  g ◦  f  :  f −1(U ) →  R. 
In  this  example,  both  X  and  Y  are  locally  ringed  spaces.  Moreover,  the  homomorphism 
f ♯  has  an  important  property  not  implied  by  the  deﬁnition  of  a  morphism  of  ringed  spaces: 
if  g  :  U  →  R vanishes  at  some point  y  ∈  Y , then  g ◦ f  vanishes  at  any point  x  ∈  X  for which 
f (x) =  y .  More  generally,  the  value  of  g  at  y  equals  the  value  of  g ◦  f  at  x. 

1 

This  is  such  an  important  property  that  we  build  it  into  the  deﬁnition  of  a  morphism 
of locally  ringed  spaces.  If (X, OX )  and (Y , OY  )  are  locally  ringed  spaces,  a  morphism  of 
locally  ringed  spaces  is  a  morphism  of  the  underlying  ringed  spaces  such  that  for  each  point 
x  ∈  X  mapping  to  y  ∈  Y , the induced homomorphism  OY ,y  → OX,x  of  local  rings  is  a  local 
homomorphism,  that  is,  the  inverse  image  of  mX,x  is  mY ,y . 

3  Morphisms  of  schemes 

A  morphism  between  two  schemes  is  simply  a  morphism  between  the  underlying  locally 
ringed  spaces.  E.g.,  for  U  ⊆  X  open,  restricting  X  to  U  gives  a  locally  ringed  space  which 
is  again  a  scheme,  and  the  inclusion  is  a  morphism  of  schemes.  Such  a  U  is  called  an  open 
subscheme  of  X . 
It  may  be  a  surprise  that  merely  requiring  morphisms  of  schemes  to  preserve  the  locally 
ringed  space  structure  has  the  expected  eﬀect. 

Theorem  1.  For  A  and  B  two  rings,  the  set  of  morphisms  (f , f ♯) : Spec(A) →  Spec(B ) of 
local ly  ringed  spaces  corresponds  bijectively  to  the  set  of  ring  homomorphisms  f ∗  :  B  →  A, 
where  (f , f ♯) goes  to  the  map 

f ♯(Spec(A)) : Γ(Spec(B ), OSpec(B ) ) =  B  →  Γ(Spec(B ), f∗ (OSpec(A) )) =  A. 

In  fact,  something  more  general  is  true. 

Theorem  2.  Let  LocRingSp  be  the  category  of  local ly  ringed  spaces.  For  any  local ly  ringed 
space  (X, OX ) and  any  ring  A,  there  is  a  natural  bijection 

HomLocRingSp ((X, OX ), Spec(A)) →  HomRing (A, Γ(X, OX )) 

obtained  by  taking  global  sections.  In  other  words,  the  functors  Spec  and  Γ(·, O·)  from  the 
category  of  rings  to  the  opposite  category  of  local ly  ringed  spaces  form  an  adjoint  pair. 

Proof.  We  ﬁrst  deﬁne  the  inverse  map.  Given  a  map  f ∗  :  A  →  Γ(X, OX )  and  a  point 
x  ∈  X , let  f (x) be  the  point  of  Spec(A) corresponding  to  the  inverse  image  of  mX,x  under 
the  composition  A  →  Γ(X, OX ) → OX,x . 
To see that  f  is continuous, it is enough  to check  that the inverse image of  a distinguished 
open  subset  D(g )  is  open.  But  this  inverse  image  consists  of  the  points  x  ∈  X  where 
f ∗(g ) ∈  Γ(X, OX )  has  a  nonzero  value,  and  this  is  indeed  open.  Better  yet,  if  x  ∈  X  is  a 
point where  f ∗ (g ) has a nonzero value, then (since OX,x  is a local  ring)  g  has a multiplicative 
inverse in  OX,x ,  and  so  has  a  multiplicative  inverse  everywhere  in  some  open  neighborhood 
of  X . As a corollary, we observe that  g  has  a  multiplicative  inverse  everywhere  on  f −1(D(g )) 
(since  the  local  inverses  are  unique,  and  hence  must  glue). 
Now  that  f  is  known  to  be  continuous,  we  can  deﬁne  f ♯  .  It  is  suﬃcient  to  deﬁne  it  on 
distinguished  opens,  that  is,  we  must  specify 

f ♯ (D(g )) : Γ(D(g ), OSpec(A) ) =  Ag  →  Γ(D(g ), f∗(OX )) = Γ(f −1(D(g )), OX ). 

2 

To  do  this,  write  any  h  ∈  Ag  as  a/g i  with  a  ∈  A  and  i  ∈  Z≥0 .  We  can  then  map  a  to 
Γ(X, OX ) and  then  by  restriction  to  Γ(f −1(D(g )), OX ).  By  the previous paragraph,  g  maps 
to  a  unit in Γ(f −1(D(g )), OX ),  so  we  can  compute (unambiguously) the image  of  a/g i  . 
It is  clear that if  we  start  with  a  ring  homomorphism, then pass to locally  ringed  spaces, 
then  return,  we  get  back  the  original  ring  homomorphism.  The  hard  part  is  to  check  that  if 
we  start  with  a  morphism  of locally  ringed  spaces  on the left, then go to the  right  and  come 
back,  we  get  back  the  morphism  we  started  with.  What  we  need  the  extra  condition  for  is 
to  see  that  the  underlying  map  on  topological  spaces  is  reproduced;  once  that  holds,  we  get 
the  equality  of  homomorphisms  of  ring  sheaves  by  comparing  them  on  stalks. 

Here  is  a  simple  example  to  illustrate  why  we  need  morphisms  of   locally  ringed  spaces, 
rather  than  ringed  spaces.  Let  R  be  a  discrete  valuation  ring  with  fraction  ﬁeld  K ,  e.g., 
R  =  Zp  and  K  =  Qp .  Then  Spec(K ) consists  of  a  single point (0),  while Spec(R) consists 
of  two  points  (0)  and  mR  (the  maximal  ideal)  with  the  ﬁrst  being  closed  and  the  second 
not.  The  inclusion  R  →  K  of  rings  corresponds  to  a  map  of  locally  ringed  spaces  sending 
the  unique  point  of  Spec(K ) to the point (0).  However, there is  also  a  map  of  ringed  spaces 
sending Spec(K )  to  the  point  mR  and  again  using  R  →  K  to  deﬁne  the  map  on  structure 
sheaves.  This  is  not  a  morphism  of  locally  ringed  spaces  because  the  map  R  →  K  on  stalks 
is not  a local homomorphism.  (For the good morphism, the map  on stalks is just the identity 
map  K  →  K .) 

4  Some  strange  morphisms  to  schemes 

Given  any  locally  ringed  space  (X, OX ),  we  can  use  the  previous  theorem  to  construct  a 
canonical  morphism 

(X, OX ) →  Spec(Γ(X, OX )) 

(this  is  basically an  adjunction  morphism).  This  in  itself  may  not  be  so  useful,  because  X 
may  have  very  few global functions (e.g., the Riemann sphere  with  the  sheaf  of holomorphic 
functions).  On  the  other  hand,  if  X  contains  enough  global  functions  to  separate  points 
(i.e.,  if  for  any x, y  ∈  X  we  can  ﬁnd  f  ∈  Γ(X, OX ) with  f  ∈  mX,x  but  f /∈  mX,y ), then the 
canonical homomorphism is injective. 
For instance, if  X  is  an  aﬃne  algebraic  variety, this gives  a  map  from  X  to  a  scheme.  It 
turns  out  that  this  map  is  a  bijection  from  X  to  the  closed  point  to  the  resulting  scheme, 
and in fact gives  an  embedding  of  the  category  of  varieties into the  category  of  schemes;  see 
Hartshorne  Proposition  II.2.6  and  the  related  exercise. 
Another  example  occurs  when  X  is  a  suﬃciently  small  complex  analytic  manifold (e.g., 
a  Stein  space ).  Such  examples  will  occur  when  we  talk  about  analytiﬁcation  of  complex 
algebraic  varieties  and  Serre’s  GAGA principle. 
One  other  funny  but  useful  example:  for  X  any  scheme  and  x  ∈  X ,  we  can  construct 
a  morphism  Spec(OX,x )  →  X  by  taking  any  open  aﬃne  neighborhood  U  of  x  in  X  and 
performing  adjunction  on  the  ring  map  Γ(U, OX ) → OX,x .  The  result  does  not  depend  on 

3


U ;  it  carries  the  closed  point  of  OX,x  (the  point  corresponding to  the  maximal  ideal  of  the 
local  ring)  to  x. 

5  Fibre  products 

Recall  that  a  ﬁbre product  of  the  morphisms  Y  →  X  and  Z  →  X  in  any  category  is  a  limit 
of  the diagram

i.e.,  a  ﬁnal  ob ject  among  ob jects  mapping  to  Y  and  Z  making  the  diagram  commute. 
We’ll  construct  ﬁbre  products  of  schemes  in  a  moment.  First,  we  observe  how  ﬁbre 
products  interact  with  passage  to  open  subschemes.

Lemma.  Suppose  f  :  Y  →  X  and  g  :  Z  →  X  are  morphisms  of  schemes  such  that  the  ﬁbre 
product  Y  ×X  Z  exists.  Let  π1  :  Y  ×X  Z  →  Y ,  π2  :  Y  ×X  Z  →  Z  be  the  induced  maps.  Let 
T  ⊆  X, U  ⊆  Y , V  ⊆  Z  be  open  subsets  such  that  f (U ), g (V )  ⊆  T ,  viewed  as  subschemes. 
Then 

π−1 (U ) ∩ π−1(V ),
2 
1
viewed  as  a  subscheme  of  Y  ×X  Z ,  is  a  ﬁbre  product  of  U  →  T  and  V  →  T . (In particular, 
the  construction  does  not  depend  on  T .) 

Proof.  Suppose  S  →  U  and  S  →  V  are  morphisms  such  that  S  →  U  →  T  and  S  →  V  →  T 
f

Then  S

Now writing

−1(U );  similarly,  it  lands  in  π2 
−1(V ).  So  we get  a 
that  the  image  of  S  in  Y  ×X  Z  lands in  π1 
−1 (U ) ∩ π2 
−1(V ); conversely,  any  such  map  can  be  composed  with  the  inclusion 
map  S  →  π1 
π−1(U ) ∩ π−1 
X→ ֒)V( 
, so the above argument shows that the map
is unique.

With  this,  it  is  easy  to  check  the  existence  of  ﬁbre  products. 

Theorem  3.  Al l  ﬁbre  products  exist  in  the  category  of  schemes. 

Proof.  The  easy  part  is  when  X  = Spec(A),  Y  = Spec(B ),  Z  = Spec(C ) are  all  aﬃne.  In 
that  case, the tensor product  B ⊗A  C  is  a  ﬁbre  coproduct  in  the  category  of  rings,  using  the 
maps  · ⊗ 1 :  B  →  B  ⊗A  C  and 1  ⊗ ·  :  C  →  B  ⊗A  C . 
To get the general  case,  we  apply  the previous lemma twice.  First, if  X  is  aﬃne,  then  we 
can  cover  Y  and  Z  with  open aﬃnes and  use the previous lemma to glue the  ﬁbre products. 
Second, once we know  ﬁbre products exist when  X  is  aﬃne,  we  can  cover  X  itself  with  open 
aﬃnes (and  cover  Y  and  Z  with  the  inverse  images  of  these)  and  use  the  lemma  again. 

As  noted  earlier,  this  notion  of  product  behaves  a  bit  strangely  on  the  level  of  sets.  For 
instance, Spec R  and Spec C  both  contain  a  single  point,  but  Spec C ×Spec R  Spec C  consists 
of  two points!

6  The  functor  of  points 

The previous example illustrates that the set  of points of  a scheme does not  really  reﬂect  our 
geometric  intuition,  derived  largely  from  our  experience  with  varieties,  about  the  behavior 
of  “points”  on  geometric  ob jects.  A  good  conceptual  workaround  for  this  is  the  functor  of 
points. 
Given  two  schemes  S  and  X ,  the  set  of  S -valued  points  of  X , denoted  X (S ),  is  simply 
the  set  Hom(S, X ) of  morphisms  of  schemes.  If  S  = Spec R,  we  may  write  X (R) instead  of 
X (S ).  For  instance,  for  any  ring  R,  deﬁne  the  aﬃne  space  An 
Spec R[x1 , . . . , xn ].  Then 
R  = 
for  any  ring  R, 

An 
Z

(R) =  An  (R) =  Rn  .

A more telling  example is the ﬁbre product.  If  Y

X  and  Z

→ 

X  are morphisms, then 

Hom(S, Y

,

where  the  right  side  denotes  the  usual  ﬁbre  product  in  the  category  of  sets,  i.e.,  you  take 
pairs of morphisms from  S , one to  Y  and  one to  Z , which  agree when you pass to morphisms 
from  S  to  X . 
If  we  ﬁx  X ,  we  may  view  X (·)  as  a  functor  on  the  category  of  schemes.  There  is  an 
appropriate sense in which it is a  sheaf  on that category, but never mind  that for now.  The 
one  thing  you  might  want  to  take  away  from  this  is  that  if  X  is  covered  by  open  aﬃnes  Ui , 
n
a  morphism  S  →  X  may  not  land  in  any  one  of  the  Ui . 
For instance,  PZ
(S ) is  not  just

which does

not  factor  through  a  distinguished  open.  (See  exercises.) 
The functor of points doesn’t by itself prove much  of  anything; for instance, it doesn’t tell 
you  how  to  construct  the  ﬁbre  product.  However,  it  can  be  used  to  suggest  certain  natural 
deﬁnitions,  e.g.,  the  deﬁnition  of  a  group  scheme.  See  exercises. 

7  Zen  and  the  art  of  base  change 

Although  the  ﬁbre  product  is  a  symmetric  construction  in  the  two  factors,  in  algebraic 
geometry  we  will  often  use  it  in  an  asymmetric  fashion.  Namely,  for  f  :  Y  →  X  a  morphism 
and  g  :  Z  →  X  another  morphism,  we  refer  to  f  ×  g  :  Y  ×X  Z  →  Z  as the  base  change  of  f 
by  g .  Geometrically,  if  you  imagine  f  as  giving  a  family  of  geometric  ob jects  parametrized 
by  X ,  f  × g  describes  the  pullback  of  this  family  to  Z . 
When  we start deﬁning properties of  morphisms (next lecture),  we will be particularly 
concerned  with  their  behavior  under  base  change.  Typical  questions: 

(a)  Is  the  property  stable  under  arbitrary  base  change?  If  not,  how  about  base  changes 
where  the  base  change  morphism  is  itself  restricted  in  some  way? 

5 

(b)  Does  the  property  descend  down  a  suitable  base  change?  E.g.,  if  g  is  surjective,  does 
f  × g  having  the  property  imply  the  same  for  f ? 

In particular, if (b) is true whenever g  :  �i  Ui  →  X  is a covering of  X  by open subschemes, 
we say that the property is  local  on the target. For instance, by our lemma about base change, 
the  property  of  being  injective/surjective  on  points  is  local  on  the  target. 
We’ll  give  many  examples  of  properties  of  morphisms  later.  Here  are  two  to  use  as  a 
mental  model.  For  f  :  Y  →  X  a  morphism  of  schemes  with  X  = Spec(A) aﬃne,  we  say  that 
f  is  aﬃne  if  Y  = Spec(B )  is  also  aﬃne.  I  claim  that  this  property  satisﬁes  the  following 
condition. 

:  Y  →  X  be  a  morphism  with  X  aﬃne.  Let  D(g1), . . . , D(gn)  be  a  ﬁnite 
(i)  Let  f 
covering  of  X  by distinguished  open subsets.  Then  f  is aﬃne if  and  only if  the induced 
morphisms  Y  ×X  D(gi) →  D(gi ) are  all  aﬃne. 

This  follows  from  the  assigned  Hartshorne  exercise  II.2.17,  since  the  gi  generate  the  unit 
ideal in Γ(Y , OY  ).  (We’ll  prove  something much  stronger  in  the  next  lecture.) 
It  can be deduced from this (exercise)  that for  f  :  Y  →  X  an  arbitrary  morphism,  the 
following  are  equivalent. 

(a)  For  a  single  open  aﬃne  cover  {Ui}i∈I  of  X ,  each  induced  morphism  Y  ×X  Ui  →  Ui  is 
aﬃne. 

(b)  For each  open aﬃne cover  {Ui}i∈I  of  X , each induced  morphism  Y  ×X  Ui  →  Ui  is aﬃne. 
(In  other  words,  for  every open  aﬃne  U  ⊆  X ,  the  induced  morphism  Y  ×X  U  →  U  is 
aﬃne.) 

If  these  hold,  we  say  that  f  itself  is  aﬃne. 
In  this  case,  we  have  an  extra  condition  that  is  evidently  satisﬁed. 

(ii)  Let  f  :  Y  →  X  be  a  morphism  with  X  aﬃne,  which  is  aﬃne.  Then  for  any  morphism 
g  :  Z  →  X  with  Z  also  aﬃne,  f  ×  g  :  Y  ×X  Z  →  Z  is  also  aﬃne.


In this  case, (a)  and (b)  are  equivalent to this  condition (exercise  again).


(c)  For  every  morphism  g  :  Z  →  X  with  Z  aﬃne,  f  ×  g  :  Y  ×X  Z  →  Z  is  ﬁnite. 

Moreover,  these  equivalent  conditions  are  stable  under  arbitrary  base  change. 
Here  is  another  important  example.  For  f 
:  Y  →  X  a  morphism  of  schemes  with 
X  = Spec(A) aﬃne,  we  say  that  f  is  ﬁnite  if  Y  = Spec(B ) is  also  aﬃne  and  B  is  ﬁnite  as 
an  A-module.  I  claim this  satisﬁes (i)  and (ii).  For (i),  we  already know that  Y  = Spec(B ) 
is  aﬃne.  Suppose  B  ⊗A  Agi  is  generated  as  an  Agi -module  by  some  ﬁnite  set  of  elements. 
Since  each  element  is  an  element  of  B  divided  by  a  power  of  gi ,  we  can  generate  B  ⊗A  Agi 
as  an  Agi -module  with  a  ﬁnite  subset  of  B  itself.  These  subsets  together  generate  a  ﬁnite 
A-submodule  B  ′  such  that (B/B  ′  ) ⊗A  Agi  =  0  for  each  i.  That  is,  the  sheaf  corresponding 
to the  A-module  B/B  ′  is  zero;  but  by  a  theorem  from  last  time,  this  forces  B/B  ′  = 0. 
For (ii),  note that if  Z  = Spec(C ), then Y  ×X  Z  = Spec(B  ⊗A  C ) and  B  ⊗A  C  is  ﬁnite 
as  a  C -module:  use  a  set  of  generators  of  B  as  an  A-module.

8  Back  to  schemes  for  a  moment 

The  strategy  I  just  introduced  can  be  used  to  establish  properties  of  schemes,  not  just 
morphisms, using  a trick:  to deﬁne a property  P  of  schemes, say  that  a morphism  f  :  Y  →  X 
has property  P  if  and  only  if  f  is  an  isomorphism  and  X  has property  P . 
For  instance,  an  aﬃne  scheme  is  reduced  if  its  corresponding  ring  A  has  no  nilpotent 
elements.  This  holds  if  each  local  ring  of  A  is  reduced (exercise),  so in particular (i)  holds. 
This allows us to extend  the deﬁnition of  reducedness to arbitrary  schemes,  and  the resulting 
condition  holds  if  and  only  if  each  local  ring  of  the  scheme  is  reduced. 
Another  approach  is  to  recall  that  each  scheme  admits  a  unique  morphism  to  Spec(Z), 
and  extract  properties  of  schemes  from  properties  of  this  morphism.  Trivial  example:  X  is 
aﬃne  if  and  only  if  X  →  Spec(Z) is  aﬃne.
