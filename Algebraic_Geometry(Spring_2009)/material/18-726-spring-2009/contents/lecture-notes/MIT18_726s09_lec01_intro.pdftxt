18.726:  Algebraic  Geometry  (K.S.  Kedlaya,  MIT,  Spring  2009) 
Introduction 

In  this  lecture,  I’ll  give  a  bit  of  an  overview  of  what  we  will  be  doing  this  semester,  and 
in particular how it  will diﬀer from 18.725.  We  will  start in  earnest (with the  rudiments  of 
category  theory)  in  the  next  lecture. 

1  Where  we  were,  and  where  we  need  to  go 

In  18.725,  we  studied  the  notion  of  an  abstract  algebraic  variety  over  an  algebraically  closed 
ﬁeld.  This  combines  a  lot  of  the  commutative  algebra  developed  in  the  early  20th  century 
(largely to  explain  the  geometric  reasoning  of  the  masters  of  the  Italian  school)  with  Weil’s 
fundamental idea to glue aﬃne algebraic varieties in the same way  that  one glues local  charts 
together  to  build  manifolds.  So  what’s  left? 

•	 We  would  like  to  deal  with  phenomena  of  nonreducedness,  for  instance  as  it  emerges 
under  degenerations.  One  of  the  key  ideas  of  the  Italian  school  for  understanding 
things  like  the  geometry  of  the  moduli  space  of  curves  was  to  notice  that  if  you  have 
a  family  of  algebro-geometric  ob jects  deﬁned  in  terms  of  a  parameter  t,  then  the 
behavior  of  a particular  member  of  the family  is  sometimes  much  simpler than that  of 
a general  member.  For instance, for a general  t,  the  elliptic  curve  y 2  =  x3 + tx + t  does 
not  have  a  rational  parametrization,  but  it  does  in  the  special  case  t  =  0.  One  can 
often understand  something  about the general  member of  the family by  ﬁrst  analyzing 
a  special  member,  then  ﬁguring  out  how  the  information  you  are  looking  for  gets 
transmitted  back  to  the  general  member  via  the  degeneration. 

However,  degenerations  of  algebraic  varieties  are  not  always  best  viewed  as  algebraic 
0,  then  the  homogeneous  polynomial  y 2  − tx2  in  x, y , z 
varieties.  For  example,  if  t 
= 
(over,  say,  the  complex  numbers)  deﬁnes  a  pair  of  lines.  The  degeneration  at  t  = 0, 
however,  is  the  single  line  y  =  0,  because  the  equations  y 2  =  0  and  y  =  0  deﬁne  the 
same variety.  In order for the degeneration to preserve the degree of  the curve, we need 
to  remember  that  it  is  y 2  rather than  y  which  deﬁnes  this  line.  That  is,  the  function 
y  on  the  variety  should  be  nilpotent,  a  possibility  that  is  not  aﬀorded  by  the  category 
of  algebraic  varieties. 

•	 We  would  like  to  work  over  ﬁelds  which  are  not  algebraical ly  closed.  The  restriction  to 
algebraically  closed  ﬁelds  was  originally  needed  to  make  things  like  B´ezout’s  theorem 
work.  However,  at  the  end  of  the  day,  we  are  sometimes  interested  in  solving  polyno­
mials  over  non-algebraically  closed  ﬁelds.  For  instance,  the  elliptic  curves  y 2  =  x3 + tx 
deﬁned by  rational  numbers  t  are all isomorphic as algebraic varieties over the complex 
numbers.  However,  they  have  rather  diﬀerent  arithmetic  behaviors;  for  instance,  the 
curve for  t  = 1 has only  ﬁnitely  many  rational points, whereas the curve for  t  = 73 has 
inﬁnitely  many.

Weil  had  an  answer  for  this  point:  he  suggested  embedding  one’s  given  base  ﬁeld  in 
a  large  algebraically  closed  ﬁeld,  called  a  universal domain.  However,  Weil’s  answer 
looks  like  a  mistake  in  hindsight,  because  it  is  not  suﬃciently  functorial ;  see  below. 

•	 We  would  also  like  to  work  over  (commutative,  unital)  rings,  not  just  ﬁelds.  For 
instance,  already  in  Weil’s  work  the  question  of  reduction  mod  p  arises,  but  cannot  be 
addressed  while  working  over  ﬁelds. 

Even  in  the  context  of  varieties,  one  often  wants  to  work  over  a  base  which  is  not  a 
ﬁeld.  For instance, the theory  of  el liptic  surfaces  is largely  thought  of by  viewing  these 
surfaces  as (relative)  elliptic  curves  over  a base  curve. 

There’s  more,  but  enough  for  now. 

2  Paradigm  shift  1:  sheaves 

At  the  time,  one  might  have  expected  that  the  future  development  of  algebraic  geometry 
would  proceed  as  a  natural  descent  from  Weil’s  1946  Foundations,  with  more  bells  and 
whistles attached  to extend generality.  However, just as the theory  of  epicycles to explain the 
motion of planets was thrown into disrepute by  two paradigm shifts (Galileo’s heliocentricity 
and  Kepler’s  elliptic  orbits),  two  paradigm  shifts  rendered  Weil’s  foundations  a  dead  end  in 
the  development  of  algebraic  geometry.  (Most  material  written  in  that  language  has  since 
appeared  in  modern  terminology;  what  remains  untranslated  is  as  intelligible  to  the  modern 
reader  as  Chaucer’s  Middle  English.) 
The  ﬁrst  of  these  shifts  can  be  attributed  to  Serre,  who  introduced  the  notion  of  sheaves 
into  algebraic  geometry.  These  are  the  sort  of  ob jects  deﬁned  by  descriptions  like  “take  all 
continuous  functions  on  all  open  subsets  of  a  topological  space”,  or  “take  all  diﬀerentiable 
functions  on  all  open  subsets  of  a  smooth  manifold”.  The  latter  example  is  particularly 
helpful  to  keep  in  mind: 
it  is  possible  to  have  two  diﬀerent  smooth  manifolds  which  are 
isomorphic  as topological  spaces (e.g., to  R4 ,  or  to  a  seven-dimensional  sphere),  but  not  as 
smooth  manifolds.  That  is,  the  underlying  topological  space  does  not  carry  enough  infor­
mation  to  detect  nonisomorphism  of  smooth  manifolds.  However,  the  sheaf  of  diﬀerentiable 
functions  does  carry  enough  information. 
Sheaves  were  originally  introduced  by  Cartan  in  order  to  simplify  and  extend  the  theory 
of  complex  analytic  geometry.  It  is  Serre  who  recognized  their  place  in  modern  algebraic 
geometry, by  observing (among  other things)  that they give you  a natural  way  to add  nilpo­
tents.  In  my  example  of  the  lines  y  =  0  versus  y 2  = 0 in  the (x, y )-plane,  it  will  turn  out 
that (in the  category  of  schemes)  the  underlying  sets  of  these two  ob jects  will be the  same, 
but  the  sheaves  of  regular  functions  will  diﬀer. 
However,  it  will  take  us  some  time  before  we  can  relate  sheaves  to  algebraic  geometry. 
We  will  ﬁrst  have  to  take  some  time  to  discuss  topological  spaces  equipped  with  rings  of 
“interesting” functions, giving  rise to the notion of  a  local ly  ringed  space. This notion includes 
many familiar things:  topological  spaces, topological  manifolds,  smooth  manifolds,  and  even 
abstract  algebraic  varieties.

But what  we really  want to include into this category is the prime spectrum of  an arbitrary 
(commutative)  ring.  Recall  that  over  an  algebraically  closed  ﬁeld,  by  the  Nullstellensatz 
there  is  a  bijection  between  the  points  of  an  aﬃne  algebraic  variety  and  the  maximal  ideals 
of  its  ring  of  regular  functions.  For  a  general  ring,  Zariski  suggested  to  instead  look  at  the 
set  of  prime  ideals,  i.e.,  the  prime  spectrum  of  the  ring;  that  way,  any  map  of  rings  would 
correspond  to  a  map (contraction)  on prime ideals in the  opposite direction. 
The  “fundamental  theorem  of  schemes”  is  that  this  set  carries  the  natural  structure  of 
a  sheaf  of  rings.  In  other  words,  the  prime  spectrum  of  a  ring  can  be  viewed  as  a  locally 
ringed  space.  With that (nontrivial)  fact in hand,  we  will be ready to glue prime  spectra 
together  to  manufacture  arbitrary  schemes. 

3  Paradigm  shift  2:  functors 

The second paradigm shift that stood between Weil  and  modern algebraic geometry is mostly 
due  to  Grothendieck,  though  it  is  of  a  piece  with  the  formalist  view  of  mathematics  pro­
pounded by the Bourbaki  school  of French  mathematicians in the middle of  the 20th  century. 
It  is  to  conceive  of  algebraic  geometry  in  the  language  of  categories  and  functors.  Roughly 
speaking,  a  category  is  the  collection  of  all  mathematical  ob jects  of  a  given  type,  equipped 
with  the maps between those ob jects that preserve the distinguishing  structures.  The key  ex­
ample to keep in mind is the category  of  all  rings, together with  all homomorphisms between 
rings. 
At  ﬁrst, it  may  seem rather a bad idea to deal  with  categories;  for one thing, they  cannot 
be  viewed  as  sets due to  some  annoying paradoxes in  set theory (such  as Russell’s paradox). 
But  once you get past  such  considerations, dealing  with  categories is not  so hard, and in fact 
they  appear  everywhere  around  you. 
Here  is  where  categories  appear  naturally  in  algebraic  geometry.  Say  P1 , . . . , Pm  are 
polynomials  in  the  variables  x1 , . . . , xn  over  a  ring  R.  Then  for  any  ring  S  equipped  with  a 
homomorphism  R  →  S ,  it  makes  sense  to  consider  the  set 

{(x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈  S n  :  P1 (x1 , . . . , xn ) =  · · ·  =  P m (x1 , . . . , xn ) = 0} 

of  S -valued  solutions  to  the  system  of  equations  P1  =  · · ·  =  P m  = 0.  One  should  thus  avoid 
linking  these  polynomials  to  a  single  set  of  “points”,  but  instead  view  them  as  a  scheme  for 
converting  rings into sets of  solutions.  This gives a natural  example of  a  functor  between two 
categories,  i.e.,  a  rule  for  converting  ob jects  of  one  category  into  ob jects  of  the  other,  and 
for  converting  morphisms  between  two  ob jects  of  the  ﬁrst  category  into  morphisms  between 
the  image  ob jects  of  the  second  category.  (In  our  example,  we  are  converting  R-algebras 
into  sets.) 
One  beneﬁt  of  this  point  of  view  is  that  it  naturally  distinguishes,  for  instance,  the  zero 
loci  of  y  and  y 2 : they give the same sets when we plug  in an algebraically  closed  ﬁeld  k , but 
not  when  we  plug  in  a  ring  such  as  k [ǫ]/(ǫ2 ). 
That  beneﬁt  by  itself  is  not  so  signiﬁcant,  as  it  still  doesn’t  really  prove  that  category 
theory  is  good  for  anything  other  than  formulating  simple  statements  in  complicated  lan­

guage.  What  makes category  theory  so useful, and how we will  exploit it in our work, is that 
it lets you formalize certain types of  “reasoning by  analogy” that  mathematicians would like 
to  engage  in  all  the  time,  but  which  is  sometimes  diﬃcult.  One  key  example  in  the  context 
of  schemes is the notion of  a  product. Given two mathematical  ob jects  X  and  Y , how should 
one  deﬁne  their  product  X  ×  Y ?  When  X  and  Y  are  given  as  sets  carrying  some  extra 
structure (e.g., groups,  rings,  etc.), the correct  answer is to take the Cartesian product of 
the  underlying  sets  and  then  somehow  cook  up  a  good  structure  on  that. 
From the point of  view of  category theory, though, the right  way to answer this question is 
to  specify  a  universal property  that  should be satisﬁed by  the product.  Namely, the product 
X  ×  Y  should have the following properties. 

(a)  It  should  come  with  pro jection  maps  π1  :  X  ×  Y  →  X  and  π2  :  X  ×  Y  →  Y . 

(b)  Given  any  ob ject  Z ,  the  function  taking  a  map  f  :  Z  →  X  ×  Y  to  the  pair  of  compo­
sitions  π1  ◦  f  :  Z  →  X  and  π2  ◦  g  :  Z  →  Y  should  be  a  bijection. 

This  does  not  by  itself  actually  construct  products;  indeed,  some  categories  may  not  always 
admit  product  ob jects  according  to  this  deﬁnition.  However,  it  does  give  a  characterization 
of how a  “correct” deﬁnition of  a product  ob ject  should behave.  In fact, it’s okay  to come up 
with  two  diﬀerent  deﬁnitions  as  long  as  they  both  satisfy  the  universal  property;  the  eﬀect 
is  that  there  will  be  canonical identiﬁcations  between  the  two  types  of  pro jects. 
We  will  use  this  particular  example  to  construct  products  in  the  category  of  schemes. 
There,  we  will  discover  that  the  product  of  two  schemes  does  not  have  underlying  set  equal 
to  the  Cartesian  products  of  the  underlying  sets!
