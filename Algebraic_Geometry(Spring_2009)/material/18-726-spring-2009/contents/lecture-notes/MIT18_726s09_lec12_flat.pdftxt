Flat  morphisms  and  descent  (updated  11  Mar  09) 

Hartshorne  only  treats  ﬂatness  after  cohomology  (so  see  III.9)  and  doesn’t  talk  about 
descent  at all.  The EGA  reference  for ﬂatness  is EGA  IV, part 2,  §2.  I’m not  sure  if descent 
is  discussed  at  all  in  EGA,  so  I  gave  references  to  SGA  1  instead. 

1  Flat  sheaves  and  ﬂat  morphisms 

Let  f  :  Y  � X  be  a  morphism  and  let  F  be  a  quasicoherent  OY  -module.  We  say  F  is  ﬂat 
relative  to  f  if  for  each  point  y  �  Y  with  f (y ) =  x,  if  we  use  the  map  f �  : OX,x  � OY ,y  to 
view  F  as  a  OX,x -module,  then  that  module  is  ﬂat  in  the  usual  sense.  (The  usual  sense  is 
that  an  R-module M  is  ﬂat  if  tensoring  with  it  is  exact,  not  just  right  exact.)  If  this  holds 
at  a  particular  y ,  we  say  F  is  ﬂat  at  y  relative  to  f . 
Two  special  cases: 

•	 If  Y  = X ,  we  say  that F  is  a  ﬂat  OX -module ;  it  is  equivalent  to  saying  that  tensoring 
with  F  is  an  exact  functor  on  quasicoherent  OX -modules.  For  instance,  any  locally 
free  OX -module  is  ﬂat. 

•	 If F  = OY  , we  say  that f  is  a ﬂat morphism.  For example,  any open  immersion  is ﬂat. 

Note  that  if F  is  a ﬂat OY  -module  and  f  is  a ﬂat morphism,  then F  is  ﬂat  relative  to  f . 
Note  that  also  that  ﬂatness  is  local  on  the  source,  not  just  on  the  target,  and  stable  under 
base  change. 

Lemma.  Let  X  =  Spec(R)  be  an  aﬃne  scheme,  and  let  M  be  an  R-module.  Then  M˜ is  a 
ﬂat  OX -module  if  and  only  if M  is  a  ﬂat  R-module. 

Proof.  This  should be a familiar fact  from commutative algebra:  M  is ﬂat over R  if and only 
if Mp  is  ﬂat  over  Rp  for  each  prime  ideal  p.  For  completeness,  I  include  the  proof  here. 
Suppose  ﬁrst  that  M  is  ﬂat.  Let  p  be  an  ideal  and  let  N  �  P  be  an  injection  of 
Rp -modules.  We may  then  view  N , P  as  R-modules  and  identify 

Mp  �R  N  = Mp  �Rp  N 

and  similarly  for  P .  Since  localization  is  ﬂat,  Rp  is  a  ﬂat  R-algebra,  so  Mp  is  ﬂat  not  just 
over  Rp  but  also  over  R.  Hence Mp  � N  � Mp  � P  is  injective,  so Mp  is  ﬂat  over  Rp . 
Suppose  next  that Mp  is  ﬂat  over  Rp  for  each  p.  If N  � P  is  an  injection  of R-modules, 
we must  check  that M � N  � M � P  is  still  injective.  Localizing  gives Mp � Np  � Mp � Pp 
(since  localization  commutes  with  tensor  product), which  is  injective  because Mp  is  ﬂat. 

Corollary.  Let  A  �  B  be  a  homomorphism  of  rings.  Then  Spec(B )  �  Spec(A)  is  ﬂat  if 
and  only  if  B  is  ﬂat  as  an  A-module.

Proof.  The  statement  that  Spec(B )  �  Spec(A)  is  ﬂat  says  that  for  each  q  �  Spec(B ) 
mapping  to  p  �  Spec(A),  the  morphism  Ap  �  Bq  is  ﬂat.  This  follows  from  A  �  B  being 
ﬂat  because  the  localization  Bp  �  Bq  is  ﬂat.  Conversely,  suppose  that  this  holds.  Let 
N ��  P  be  an  injection  of  A-modules.  Then  for  each  prime  ideal  p  of  A,  we  may  view 
Bp  �A  N  �  Bp  �A  P  as  a  morphism  of  Bp-modules.  For  each  prime  ideal  q  of  B  over  p, 
tensoring  with  Bq  over  Bp  simply  gives  Bq  �A  N  �  Bq  �A  P .  This  is  injective  because 
A � Ap  is  ﬂat  always  and  Ap  � Bq  is  ﬂat  by  hypothesis. 
Applying  the  previous  lemma  over  Bp ,  we may  now  deduce  that Bp  �A  N  � Bp �A  P  is 
injective.  That  is,  Bp  is  ﬂat  over  A,  or  equivalently  over  Ap .  Applying  the  previous  lemma 
over  A,  we  deduce  that  B  is  ﬂat  over  A. 

The  notion  of  ﬂatness,  while  useful  (especially  when  we  study  cohomology),  is  geomet­
rically  somewhat  mysterious.  For  pro jective  morphisms,  one  can  give  a  geometric  interpre­
tation  in  terms  of  Hilbert  polynomials ; more  on  that  later.  In  the  interim,  you  may  wish  to 
chew  on  the  following  examples.  (See  Eisenbud-Harris  II.3.4  for more  examples.) 
Let  k  be  an  algebraically  closed  ﬁeld.  The  morphism 
Spec k [x, t]/(x 2  − t) � Spec k [t] 
is  ﬂat.  If  the  characteristic  of  k  is  not  2,  then  the  ﬁbres  above  points  t  →=  0  are  pairs  of 
distinct  points  whereas  the  ﬁbre  above  t = 0  is  the  doubled  origin  in  Spec k [x]. 
The  morphism 

Spec k [x, t]/(x 2  − t2 ) � Spec k [t] 
is  also  ﬂat,  but  the  source  is  not  normal.  If  we  replace  the  source  by  its  normalization,  we 
get  two  copies  of  the  aﬃne  line mapping  to  one  aﬃne  line,  and  this  is  also  ﬂat. 
Hartshorne  gives  the  example  of  the  family  of  cubic  curves  in  A3  given  as  parametric 
equations  in  u  by 

x = u 2  − 1, y = u 3  − u, z = tu. 
If  we  eliminate  u  and make  sure  the  result  is  ﬂat  over  Spec k [t],  we  get 
Spec k [x, y , z , t]/(t2 (x + 1) − z 2 , tx(x + 1) − yz , xz − ty , y 2  − x 2 (x + 1)) � Spec k [t]. 
The  ﬁbre  over  t  =  0  is  supported  on  the  plane  curve  y 2  =  x2 (x + 1), z  =  0  but  is  not  a 
subscheme  of  the  plane  z  =  0  in  Spec k [x, y , z ]:  the  local  ring  at  the  origin  contains  the 
nonzero  nilpotent  element  z . 
Here  are  some  deep  results  about  ﬂatness.  For  this  one,  see  EGA  4,  part  2,  Th´eoreme 
2.4.6 
Theorem  1.  Let  f  : X  � Y  be  a  morphism  which  is  ﬂat  and  local ly  of  ﬁnite  presentation. 
Then  f  is  universally  open,  i.e.,  any  base  change  of  f  is  an  open  map  (the  image  of  any 
open  set  is  open)  on  topological  spaces. 
For  this  one,  see  SGA  1,  Expos´e  IV,  Th´eor`eme  6.10  or  EGA  4,  part  3,  11.1.1. 
Theorem  2.  Let  f  :  Y  �  X  be  a  morphism  of  ﬁnite  type,  with  X  local ly  noetherian,  and 
let  F  be  a  quasicoherent  OY -module.  The  set  of  y � Y  at  which  F  is  ﬂat  relative  to  f  is  an 
open  subset  of  U .

2  Faithfully  ﬂat  morphisms  and  descent 

A  morphism  which  is  both  ﬂat  and  surjective  is  faithful ly  ﬂat.  For  instance,  if  Spec(B ) � 
Spec(A)  is  a morphism  of  aﬃne  schemes,  then  this morphism  is  faithfully  ﬂat  if  and  only  if 
B  is  faithfully  ﬂat  in  the  usual  sense,  i.e.,  B  is  ﬂat  over  A,  and  for  any  A-module  M ,  the 
map M  � M �A  B  of A-modules  is  injective. 
Faithfully  ﬂat  morphisms  are  important  because  of  their  role  in  descent,  the  process  of 
“undoing”  a  base  change.  Here  is  a  typical  example. 
Let  f  :  Y  � X  be  a  morphism.  Let  �1 , �2  :  Y  ×X  Y  �  Y  be  the  canonical  pro jections. 
The  category  of  descent  data  for  quasicoherent  sheaves  relative  to  f  is  deﬁned  as  follows.  A 
descent datum is a quasicoherent  O -module  F  equipped with an isomorphism  � �:

A  morphism  of  two  descent  data  is  a  morphism  F � G  of  the  underlying  OY  -modules,

such that the induced morphisms  � F �  � G  and  � F �  �2
G  commute  with  the  isomor­

phisms  � .  There  is  no  extra  cocycle  condition. 
In  general,  there  is  a  functor  from  quasicoherent  OX -modules  to  descent  data  taking  E

to 

Theorem  3  (Faithfully  ﬂat  descent).  Let  f  :  Y  �  X  be  a  faithful ly  ﬂat,  quasicompact 
morphism.  Then  the  natural  functor  from  quasicoherent  OX -modules  to  descent  data  for 
quasicoherent  sheaves  deﬁned  by  f  is  an  equivalence  of  categories. 

The  reference  for  this  is  SGA  1,  Expos´e  VIII,  section  1.  However,  the  proof  there  is 
written  in  a  somewhat  cryptic  manner;  we  will  see  a  somewhat  simpliﬁed  proof  in  the 
exercises. 
Note that faithfully ﬂat descent for quasicoherent sheaves includes as a special case Galois 
descent :  if  L/K  is  a  ﬁnite  Galois  extension  of  ﬁelds,  and  V  is  an  L-vector  space  equipped 
with  a  semilinear  action  of Gal(L/K ),  then  V  has  a  basis  of  invariant  elements.  (The  usual 
proof  uses  Noether’s  nonabelian  generalization  of  Hilbert’s  Theorem  90,  i.e.,  the  fact  that 
the  ﬁrst  Galois  cohomology  set  of  Gal(L/K )  acting  on  GLn (L)  is  trivial.) 
Armed  with  faithfully  ﬂat  descent  for  quasicoherent  sheaves,  one  can  now  establish  de­
scent  for  various  properties  of morphisms.  (Some  of  these  can  be  found  in  EGA  4,  part  2.) 
For  example: 

Theorem  4.  Let  f  :  Y  �  X  be  a  morphism,  and  let  g  :  Z  �  X  be  a  faithful ly  ﬂat 
quasicompact  morphism.  Then  f  is  of  ﬁnite  type  if  and  only  if  the  base  change  of  f  by  g  is 
of  ﬁnite  type. 

Proof.  Suppose  ﬁrst  that X  = Spec(A),  Y  = Spec(B ),  Z  = Spec(C )  are  all  aﬃne,  and  that 
the base  change of f  by  g  is of ﬁnite  type.  Then B  is  the direct  limit of  its ﬁnitely  generated 
A-subalgebras  Bi ,  and  so B �A  C  is  the  direct  limit  of  the  ﬁnitely  generated  C -subalgebras 

3


Bi  �A  C .  By  hypothesis,  B �A  C  is  ﬁnitely  generated  as  a  C -algebra;  each  generator  can 
itself  be  written  in  terms  of  ﬁnitely  many  elements  of  B  and  C .  Hence  B  �A  C  can  be 
generated  over  C  by  ﬁnitely many  elements  of B ,  and  so must  occur  as  one  of  the B i  �A  C . 
For  that  index  i,  the  fact  that  the  inclusion Bi  � B  is  an  isomorphism  follows  from  the  fact 
that Bi �A C � B �A C  is  an  isomorphism  because C  was  assumed  to be  faithfully ﬂat over 
A. 

To  ﬁnish,  we  must  show  that  if  the  base  change  of  f  by  g  is  quasicompact,  then  f  is 
quasicompact.  We  may  assume  X  is  aﬃne,  as  then  is  Z  because  g  was  required  to  be 
quasicompact,  as  then  is  Y  ×X  Z  by  hypothesis.  Let  {Ui }  be  an  open  aﬃne  cover  of  Y . 
By  hypothesis,  the  open  cover  {Ui  ×X  Z }  of  Y  ×X  Z  admits  a  ﬁnite  subcover.  Since  those 
Z  � X  is  surjective,  the corresponding Ui  must  then  cover Y .  Hence Y  is a union of ﬁnitely 
many  aﬃnes,  hence  quasicompact.
