18.726:  Algebraic  Geometry  (K.S.  Kedlaya,  MIT,  Spring  2009) 
Higher  Riemann-Roch 

In  this  lecture,  we  discuss  some  higher-dimensional  versions  of  the  Riemann-Roch  theo­
rem:  the  Riemann-Roch  theorem  for  surfaces,  the  Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch  theorem,  and 
the  Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch  theorem.  For  the  ﬁrst,  see  Hartshorne  V.1;  for  the  others, 
see  Chapter  15  of  Fulton’s  Intersection Theory  (a  well-deserved  winner  of  the  Steele  Prize 
for  mathematical  exposition). 

1  Surfaces 

Let  X  be  a  smooth  irreducible  pro jective  surface  over  an  algebraically  closed  ﬁeld  k . Let  K 
be  a  canonical  divisor  on  X .  As  in  the  case  of  curves,  the  Riemann-Roch  theorem  combines 
an  input  from  Serre  duality  with  an  Euler  characteristic  calculation. 
The  input  from  Serre  duality  is  that  for  any  divisor  D , 

∼
H 0(X, L(D)∨  ⊗ ωX ) =  H 2(X, L(D))∨  . 

We  can  thus  write  the  Euler  characteristic  χ(X, L(D)) as 

dimk H 0(X, L(D)) − dimk H 1(X, L(D)) + dimk H 0(X, L(K  − D)). 

Unfortunately, we can’t do much  with  the term dimk H 1(X, L(D)) other than give it  a name: 
it’s  called  the  superabundance  of  D .  However,  we  do  at  least  know  that  it  is  nonnegative, 
and  this  turns  out  to  be  surprisingly  useful. 
The Euler characteristic calculation is made as follows.  Write  D  as the diﬀerence between 
two  eﬀective  divisors  C  − E  with  no  common  components.  We  then  have  exact  sequences 

0  → L(C  − E ) → L(C ) → L(C ) ⊗ OE  →  0, 

0  → OX  → L(C ) → L(C ) ⊗ OC  →  0. 

By  additivity  of  χ,  we  get 

χ(X, L(C  − E )) =  χ(X, OX ) + χ(C, L(C )) − χ(E , L(C )). 

The  ﬁrst  term  we  are  happy  to  leave  alone  since  it  depends  only  on  X .  The  other  two  are 
calculated  using  intersection  theory  on  the  surface  X .  For  instance,  the  term  χ(E , L(C )) 
equals  C  ·  E  + 1 − gE ,  where  gE  is  the  genus  and  C  ·  E  is  the  length  of  the  scheme-theoretic 
intersection  C  ×X  E  (this  amounts  to  Riemann-Roch on  the  curve  E ). 
it  is  C  ·  C  + 1  −  GC  where  C  ·  C  =  C 2  is  the 
The  term  χ(C, L(C ))  is  a  bit  trickier:

self-intersection  of  C . That  can be deﬁned  as  C ·  C 
if  C  is linearly  equivalent to a divisor  C 
having  no  common  components  with  C ,  but  that  is  not  always  possible.  In  fact,  the  correct 
deﬁnition  is  to  force  the  intersection  pairing  to  be  bilinear,  and  this  sometimes  involves 
letting  C 2  take  negative  values.  For  instance,  if  you  blow  up  P 2  at  a  point,  the  exceptional 
divisor  has  self-intersection  −1.  (This  is  a  general  pattern;  one  can  in  fact  blow  down  any 
curve isomorphic to  P1  with  self-intersection  −1.)

Moreover,  one  can  write  the  genera  of  C  and  E  in  terms  of  the  canonical  divisor  K , 
basically  using  Riemann-Roch  again: 

C  ·  (C  +  K ) = 2gC  − 2,

E  ·  (E  +  K ) = 2gE  − 2. 

So 

1 
χ(X, L(D)) =  D ·  (D  − K ) + χ(X, OX ).

As  in  the  case  of  curves,  this  is  useful  for  many  calculations  involving  the  geometry  of 
surfaces,  such  as  the  Hodge  index  theorem  and  the  Nakai-Moishezon  criterion.  These  in 
turn  ﬁgure in the classiﬁcation of surfaces (which you should read about in Hartshorne if 
you  are  interested  in  Abhinav’s  work). 

Theorem  (Hodge index theorem).  Fix  a  projective  embedding  of  X ,  and  let  H  be  a  divisor 
∼
with  L(H ) =  OX (1).  Then  for  any  divisor  D  such that  D  ·  H  = 0,  we  have  D2  ≤  0. (This 
also holds if  H  is  ample,  i.e.,  some  positive  multiple  of  H  comes  from  an  OX (1).) 

Theorem  (Nakai-Moishezon  criterion).  A divisor  D  on  X  is  ample  if  and  only  if  D2  >  0 
and  D  ·  C >  0  for  al l  irreducible  curves  C  on  X . 

2  Hirzebruch’s  generalization 

Hirzebruch  noticed  that  the  Euler  characteristic  aspect  of  Riemann-Roch  could  be  general­
ized  to  handle  arbitrary  vector  bundles  on  arbitrary  smooth  varieties  over  an  algebraically 
closed  ﬁeld  k .  Let  me  state  his  result  and  then  explain  what  it  means. 

Theorem  (Hirzebruch).  Let  X  be  a  smooth  proper  scheme  over  k .  Let  F  be  a  local ly  free 
coherent  sheaf  on  X .  Then 

χ(X, F ) = 

ch(F ) ·  td(TX ). 

�
X 
Here  TX  is the  tangent bund le  of  X , i.e., the dual  to the bundle  ωX  of K¨ahler diﬀerentials 
(which  is  also  called the  cotangent bund le ). 
The  Chern  character  ch  is  a  certain  map  from  coherent  sheaves  on  X  to  a  certain  group 
of  cycles  on  X .  The  latter  are  formal  Q-linear  combinations  of  subschemes  of  X  modulo  a 
relation  of  rational  equivalence. You  should imagine this  as generalizing  the function taking 
a line bundle  L  on  a  curve  C  to (the  equivalence  class  of )  the divisor  of  a  nonzero  rational 
section  of  L. 
The  group  of  cycles  is  graded  by  codimension,  and  forms  a  commutative  ring  under  the 
(appropriately  deﬁned)  intersection  pairing  with  the  identity  being  the  class  of  X  itself in 
codimension  0.  The  Chern  character  is  usually  split  up  as  �d cd(·) with  cd  being  the bit in 
codimension  d; for  F  locally  free  of  rank  1,  we  always  have 
1 
d! 

cd (F ) = 

c1 (F )d .

The Todd  class  td is another such  map  on coherent  sheaves, which I  won’t try to construct 
here,  except  to  give  the  characterizing  identity:  for  F  locally  free  of  rank  d, 

d 
td(F ) ·  �(−1)p ch(∧pF ∨ ) =  cd(F ). 
p=0 
.  The  point  is  that  it  depends  only  on  X ,  not  on  F . 
The  Chern  character  and  the  Todd  class  are  both  examples  of  characteristic  classes 
of  vector  bundles,  which  originally  appeared  in  algebraic  topology  as  tools  for  classifying 
manifolds.  For  instance,  Milnor  uses  them  to  construct  diﬀerentiable  manifolds  which  are 
homeomorphic  but  not  diﬀeomorphic  to  the  7-sphere,  the  so-called  exotic  7-spheres.  See 
Milnor  and  Stasheﬀ,  Characteristic Classes  for  an  introduction. 
Oh,  and  �X  means  use intersection theory (which is a pretty  complicated  thing  to deﬁne, 
as evidenced by  the length  of Fulton’s book), keep  only  the zero-dimensional part, and  count 
points. 

3  Grothendieck’s  generalization 

In  characteristic  fashion,  Grothendieck  noticed  that  one  can  make  a  relative  version  of  the 
Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch  theorem.  Also,  one  can  drop  the  locally  free  condition. 

Theorem  (Grothendieck).  Let  f  :  X  →  Y  be  a  proper  morphism  of  smooth  schemes  over 
an  algebraical ly  closed  ﬁeld  k .  Then  for  any  coherent  sheaf  F  on  X , 

ch(f∗F ) ·  td(TY ) =  f∗(ch(F ) ·  td(TX )). 

One  has  to  deﬁne  direct  image  for  cycles;  I  won’t  try  here. 
It should be noted that  already  our formulation of Hirzebruch’s statement is Grothendieck’s; 
the  original  statement  was  made  in  the  language  of  topology.  One  byproduct  of  this  work 
is  the  development  of  K -theory,  which  is  now  a  frequently  occurring  construction  in  both 
algebraic  topology  and  algebraic  geometry.
