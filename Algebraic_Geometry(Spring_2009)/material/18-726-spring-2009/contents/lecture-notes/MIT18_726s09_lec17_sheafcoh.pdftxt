Sheaf  cohomology  (updated  13  Apr  09)


In  the  previous  lecture,  we  discussed  the  construction  of  derived  functors  for  left  exact 
additive  functors  out  of  on  an  abelian  category  that  has  enough  injectives.  In  this  lecture, 
we  specialize  to  the  case  of  the  global  sections  functor  for  sheaves  on  a  locally  ringed  space, 
and  thus  obtain  the  deﬁnition  of  sheaf  cohomology. 

1  Having  enough  injectives 

I  thought  I  assigned  this  as  homework,  but  apparently  not,  so  here  is  the  proof. 

Lemma.  The  category  Ab  has  enough  injectives. 

Proof.  It  has  been  assigned  as  an  exercise  that  an  abelian  group G  is  injective  if  and  only  if 
it  is  divisible,  i.e.,  if  the  multiplication  by  n maps  are  surjective  for  all  positive  integers  n. 
It  remains  to  show  that  every  group G  is  isomorphic  to  a  subgroup  of  a  divisible  abelian 
group.  For  instance,  write  G  =  F /H  where  F  is  a  free  abelian  group,  then  embed  G  into 
(F  �Z  Q)/H .  If  you  want  something  more  canonical,  take  F  to  be  the  free  abelian  group 
generated  by  the  elements  of  G,  with  the  map  G ⊕  F  taking  each  g  �  G  to  the  generator 
of F  indexed  by  g  (a/k/a  the  adjunction morphism  for  the  forgetful  functor Ab ⊕ Set). 

There  isn’t  quite  as  nice  an  argument  for  ModR  because  we  don’t  have  as  simple  a 
description  of  the  injective modules.  One  proof  that ModR  has  enough  injectives  is  assigned 
as  an  exercise;  another  will  be  given  using  Grothendieck’s  criterion  later  in  this  lecture. 

2  Categories  of  sheaves  have  enough  injectives 

Let  X  be  a  locally  ringed  space,  let  C  be  an  abelian  category,  and  let  D  be  the  category 
of  sheaves  on  X  with  values  in  C ;  then  D  is  again  an  abelian  category.  However,  in  order 
to  use  the  deﬁnition  of  derived  functors,  we  need  to  know  that  D  has  enough  injectives, 
i.e.,  that  for  any  ob ject  A  � D ,  there  exists  a  monomorphism  A  ⊕  I  with  I  injective.  I 
should  certainly  assume  that  C  itself  has  enough  injectives;  but  then  how  can  we  go  about 
constructing  injective  ob jects  in  D? 
One  method  is  to  try  to  identify  the  injective  ob jects  in  D ,  but  that  is  a  bit  diﬃcult, 
even  for  C  =  Ab.  Another  method  is  to  construct  a  large  enough  class  of  injective  ob jects 
using  skyscraper  sheaves.  Let  x � X  be  a  point  and  let  G  be  an  ob ject  of  C .  We  may  then 
view  G  as  a  sheaf  on  the  one-point  topological  space  {x};  the  skyscraper  sheaf  at  x  with 
values  in  G,  denoted  ix (G)  is  the  direct  image  of  G  along  {x} ⊕  X .  Its  sections  are  G  on 
any  open  set  containing  x  and  0  otherwise;  its  stalks  are  G  at  all  points  in  the  closure  of  x 
and  0  elsewhere.

If we assume that C  has colimits, then we can use the adjointness property between direct 
and  inverse  image  to  assert  that 

HomShC (X ) (F , ix (G)) = HomC (Fx , G). 
In  particular,  if  G  is  injective  in  C ,  then  ix (G)  is  injective  in  ShC (X ).  (Remember  that  this 
means  that Hom(·, ix (G))  is  an  exact  functor.) 
If  we  assume  that  C  also  has  arbitrary  products,  it  becomes  easy  to  guess  how  to  embed 
an arbitrary sheaf F  into an  injective:  for each x � X , use  the hypothesis  that C  has enough 
 
injectives  to  construct  a  monomorphism  Fx  ⊕  Gx ,  and  then  F  embeds  into 
x�X  ix (Gx ).

Namely,  for  U  ∼ X  open,  the map

x�X
takes  a  section  s  to the  tuple  (sx ) of  its  germs.  This  is a monomorphism by  the  sheaf axiom. 
Moreover,  an  arbitrary  product  of  injective  ob jects  is  injective. 
In  fact,  something  even  stronger  is  true,  and  the proof  is  similar;  see Hartshorne,  Propo­
sition  III.3.2.  (This  reproduces  the  previous  statement  by  taking  the  sheaf  of  rings  to  be  a 
constant  sheaf.) 
Proposition.  Let  (X, OX )  be  a  ringed  space.  Then  the  category  of  sheaves  of  OX -modules 
has  enough  injectives.

Beware  that  if  X  is  a  locally  ringed  space,  it  does  not  follow  that  the  category  of  qua­
sicoherent  sheaves  of  OX -modules  has  enough  injectives.  (However,  this  is  true  for  aﬃne 
schemes  because  ModR  has  enough  injectives.) 

3  More  on  having  enough  injectives 

One can also establish that the category of sheaves has enough injectives using a very general 
criterion  introduced  by  Grothendieck  in  Sur  quelques  points... 

Theorem.  Let  C  be  an  abelian  category  satisfying  the  fol lowing  conditions. 

(a)  C  admits  arbitrary  (smal l)  direct  sums. 

(b)  Suppose  we  are  given  a  monomorphism  X  ⊕  Y  in  C ,  a  total ly  ordered  set  I ,  and  an 
increasing  family  of  subobjects  Yi  of  Y  indexed  by  i �  I .  (This  last  means  that  we  are 
given  a monomorphism Yi  ⊕ Y  for  each  i � I ,  and  a monomorphism Yi  ⊕ Yj  for  each 
i, j  in  I  with  i ∩ j ,  such  that  Yi  ⊕ Yj  ⊕ Y  agrees  with  Yi  ⊕ Y .)  Then  inside  Y ,

In other words, forming the direct limit of the Yi  commutes with taking the ﬁbred product 
with  X  over  Y .  (The  direct  limits  on  both  sides  exist  by  (a).) 

.

(c)  There  exists  an  object U  � C  such  that  for  any monomorphism X  ⊕ Y  which  is not  an 
epimorphism,  the  map  Hom(U, X )  ⊕  Hom(U, Y )  is  also  not  an  epimorphism.  (That 
is,  there  is  a  map  U  ⊕ Y  not  factoring  through  X .  Grothendieck  cal ls  U  a  generator 
of  C .)  Also,  the  class  of  isomorphism  classes  of  monomorphisms  into  U  is  smal l  (this 
is  automatic  if  C  admits  a  forgetful  additive  functor  to  Ab). 

Then  C  has  enough  injectives. 

Before  proving  this,  I  should  point  out  that  these  conditions  are  suﬃciently  weak  that 
they  are  satisﬁed  by  ModR .  Namely,  (a)  and  (b)  are  obvious,  while  (c)  holds  by  taking 
U  = R  because  then  Hom(U, ·)  coincides  with  the  forgetful  functor  to  abelian  groups.  (It  is 
also  possible  to  prove  more  directly  that ModR  has  enough  injectives,  but  never  mind.) 
I should also check  a bit more carefully that these conditions are satisﬁed by the category 
of sheaves of abelian groups on a locally ringed space.  To check (a), note that if F i  is a family 
of  sheaves  on  X ,  then  we  may  construct  the  direct  sum  by  taking  the  sheaﬁﬁcation  of  the 
presheaf  U  ⊆⊕  �iFi (U ).  We  may  check  (b)  stalkwise.  To  check  (c),  we  take  U  to  be  the 
direct  sum  over  open  subsets  V  ∼  X  of  the  pushforward  jV � (ZV )  of  the  constant  sheaf  on 
V  with  values  in  Z.  The  point  is  that  for  any  sheaf  G ,

Lemma.  Under  the  conditions  of  the  theorem,  an  object  M  � C  is  injective  if  and  only  if 
for  any  monomorphism  V  ⊕  U  into  the  generator,  every  morphism  V  ⊕  M  extends  to  a 
morphism  U  ⊕ M . 

Proof.  Exercise. 

Proof  of  the  theorem.  We make  a ﬁrst  approximation  to  the  desired  construction  as  follows. 
Let M  � C  be  any  ob ject.  Let  I (M )  be  the  set  of  isomorphism  classes  of  pairs  (T , t),  where 
T  ⊕ U  is  a monomorphism  and  t  : T  ⊕ M  is  a morphism.  Consider  the map 

�(T ,t)�I (M ) T  ⊕ M  × U I (M ) 

in  which  the  factor  of  T  coming  from  a  pair  (T , t)  maps  to  M  via  T ,  maps  to  the  (T , t)-th 
factor of U I (M )  via the monomorphism T  ⊕ U , and maps to the other factors of U I (M )  via the 
zero map.  Let M × U I (M )  ⊕ C (M ) be  the cokernel  of that map, and  let f (M ) : M  ⊕ C (M ) 
be  the  composition  of  this  with  the  injection  of M  into  the  ﬁrst  factor  of M  × U I (M ) .  One 
checks  using  (b)  that  this  is  a monomorphism. 

3 

By  construction,  we  have  a  monomorphism  f (M ) :  M  ⊕  I (M )  such  that  for  any 
monomorphism  T  ⊕  U  and  any  morphism  T  ⊕  M ,  we  can  extend  T  ⊕  M  ⊕  I (M ) 
to  a  morphism  T  ⊕  I (M ).  This  doesn’t  quite  solve  our  problem  because  M  ≤
I (M ).  The 
= 
trick  is  to  repeat  this  construction  using  transﬁnite  induction.  Namely,  start  with  M0  =  0. 
For  any  nonlimit  ordinal  i,  put  Mi+1  =  f (Mi );  for  any  limit  ordinal,  let  Mi  be  the  direct 
limit  of Mj  over  j < i.  There must  then  be  a  least  ordinal k  such  that  the  cardinality  of k  is 
strictly greater than the cardinality of the number of isomorphism classes of monomorphisms 
into  U .  Then  for  any morphism  T  ⊕ Mk ,  the  sequence  of  inverse  images  of  the Mj  in  T  for 
j < k  must  stabilize;  that  is,  T  maps  into  Mj  for  some  Mj .  Then  this  extends  to  a  map  of 
U  into Mj+1 ,  so Mk  satisﬁes  the  condition  of  the  previous  lemma. 

4	 Sheaf  cohomology  for  topological  spaces  and  ringed 
spaces 

Let  C  be  an  abelian  category  admitting  arbitrary  products  and  colimits,  and  having  enough 
injectives.  We  have  just  shown  that  for  any  topological  space  X ,  Sh C (X )  also  has  enough 
injectives.  We  may  now  deﬁne  the  sheaf  cohomology  functors  H i  :  ShC (X )  ⊕ C  to  be  the 
right derived functors of the left exact functor �(X, ·)  : ShC (X ) ⊕ C .  In particular, H 0 (X, F ) 
is  just  another  notation  for F (X )  or  �(X, F ). 
If (X, OX )  is a ringed  space, we can also deﬁne derived  functors of �(X, ·) directly  on the 
category  of  sheaves  of OX -modules.  The  fact  that  these  coincide  with  the H i  requires  some 
justiﬁcation,  but  it’s  not  hard.  One  way  to  see  it  is  to  note  that  the  H i ,  when  restricted  to 
the  category  of OX -modules,  return O(X )-modules,  then  argue  that  these  are  an  eﬀaceable 
cohomological  functor  and  so  coincide  with  the  derived  functors. 
Another  argument  is  to  use  some  acyclic  ob jects  which  are  not  injective,  remembering 
that we may use  resolutions with  these  ob jects  to compute derived  functors.  Here  is a cheap 
supply  of acyclic  ob jects.  A  sheaf F  on X  is ﬂasque  (or ﬂabby )  if  for any  inclusion V  ∼ U  of 
open sets, the restriction map F (U ) ⊕ F (V ) is surjective.  For instance,  if X  is an irreducible 
topological  space,  then  any  constant  sheaf  is  ﬂasque.  (Reminder:  for  C  � C ,  the  constant 
sheaf  C X  on  any  space  X  is  the  sheaﬁﬁcation  of  the  constant  presheaf  U  ⊆⊕  C .)  However, 
if  X  =  R  with  the  usual  topology  then  the  sections  of  C X  on  X  are  C  but  on  R \ {0}  are 
C � C ,  so  C X  is  not  ﬂasque  unless  C  = 0. 

Lemma.  For  any  ringed  space  (X, OX ),  any  injective  OX -module  is  ﬂasque.  In  particular 
(by  taking  OX  = ZX ),  any  injective  sheaf  of  abelian  groups  on  X  is  ﬂasque. 

Proof.  (Compare  Hartshorne,  Lemma  III.2.4.)  Let  I  be  an  injective  OX -module.  For  any 
open subset U  of X , let OU  denote the extension by  zero  of OX |U  to X , i.e., the sheaﬁﬁcation 
of the presheaf assigning V  to OX (V ) if V  ∼ U  and 0 otherwise.  Note that it has stalks OX,x 
for  x � U  and  0  otherwise.  (This  diﬀers  from  the  direct  image  under  the  inclusion  U λ⊕ X , 
which  has  nonzero  sections  on  any  open  set  meeting  V .) 

4 

For  V  ∼  U  an  inclusion  of  open  sets,  we  get  a  monomorphism  OV  ⊕ OU  of  sheaves  of 
OX -modules.  Since  I  is  injective,  this  gives  a  surjection  Hom(OU , I ) ⊕  Hom(OV  , I ).  But 
Hom(OU , I ) = I (U )  and Hom(OV  , I ) = I (V ),  so  I  is  ﬂasque. 

Proposition.  Let  F  be  a  ﬂasque  sheaf  of  abelian  groups  on  a  topological  space  X .  Then 
H i (X, F ) = 0  for  al l  i > 0. 

Proof.  The  argument  is  a  classic  example  of  dimension  shifting.  Embed  F  into  an  injective 
sheaf  I ,  and  put  G  = I /F .  Using  the  fact  that  F  is  ﬂasque,  we  ﬁnd  (exercise) 

0 ⊕ H 0(X, F ) ⊕ H 0 (X, I ) ⊕ H 0 (X, G ) ⊕ 0 

is  exact.  Using  this,  the  long  exact  sequence  in  cohomology  associated  to 

0 ⊕ F  ⊕ I ⊕ G ⊕ 0, 

and  the  fact  that  I  is  acyclic,  we  ﬁnd  that H 1 (X, F ) = 0  and 

H i (X, F ) ⊗
= H i−1 (X, G ) 

(i > 1).

Since  F  is  ﬂasque,  and  I  is  injective  and  hence  ﬂasque  by  the  previous  lemma,  it  follows 
that G  is  ﬂasque  (exercise).  Hence  by  the  induction  hypothesis,  we may  deduce H i(X, F ) ⊗= 
H i−1 (X, G ) = 0  for  i > 1. 

5  Sheaf  cohomology  and  topological  cohomology 

If  you  know  some  topology,  you  might  appreciate  the  following  relationship  between  sheaf 
cohomology  and  the  usual  cohomology  of  topological  spaces.  (If  not,  pretend  that  the  coho­
mology  of  the  constant  sheaf  ZX  is  the  deﬁnition  of  topological  cohomology  of  a  space  X , 
then  skip  directly  to  the  next  section.) 

Theorem.  Let  X  be  a  local ly  contractible  topological  space.  Then  the  sheaf  cohomology 
of  X  with  coeﬃcients  in  the  constant  sheaf  ZX  is  canonical ly  isomorphic  to  the  singular 
cohomology  of  X . 

Recall  that  X  is  contractible  if  there  is  a  continuous  map  f  :  X  ×  [0, 1]  ⊕  X  with 
f (x, 0)  =  x  for  all  x  �  X ,  and  f (x, 1)  =  f (y , 1)  for  all  x, y  �  X ;  it  is  local ly  contractible 
if  each  point  has  a  basis  of  contractible  neighborhoods.  For  instance,  all  manifolds  and 
CW-complexes  are  locally  contractible. 
The  singular  n-chains  in X ,  collectively  denoted  Cn (X ),  are  formal  ﬁnite  Z-linear  com­
binations  of  continuous  maps  �  :  Tn  ⊕  X ,  where  Tn  denotes  the  standard  n-simplex. 
The  boundary  map  �  :  Cn(X )  ⊕  Cn−1 (X )  takes  each  simplex  �  to  its  signed  boundary, 
i.e.,  if  Tn  has  vertices  e0 , . . . , en ,  then  for  i  = 0, . . . , n,  you  take  (−1)i  times  the  restric­
tion  to  the  subsimplex  omitting  ei .  These  form  a  homologically  graded  complex;  putting 

5


C n (X )  =  HomZ (Cn(X ), Z)  gives  the  singular  n-cochains,  which  form  a  cohomologically 
graded  complex. 
Let C n (X ) be the sheaﬁﬁcation of the presheaf U  ⊆⊕ C n (U );  it is straightforward to check 
that  in  fact C n (X )  is ﬂasque.  Using  the hypothesis  that X  is  locally contractible  (so  that we 
can  check  exactness  on  stalks  by  running  over  a  basis  of  contractible  neighborhoods),  one 
checks  that 

0 ⊕ C 0 (X ) ⊕ C 1 (X ) ⊕ · · · 
is  a  resolution  of  ZX .  We  may  thus  compute  H i (ZX )  by  computing  global  sections  of  this 
complex. 
It  remains  to  check  that  the  natural map 

C · (X ) ⊕ �(X, C · (X )) 

is  a quasi-isomorphism  of complexes.  To  see  this,  let us ﬁx  an  open  cover  {U i}  of X ,  and  let 
D ·(X )  be  the  set  of  singular  cochains  only  deﬁned  on  simplices  contained  in  some  U i .  One 
then  reduces  to  the  following  assertion. 

Lemma.  The  restriction  C ·(X )  ⊕  D ·(X )  is  a  homotopy  equivalence,  with  a  quasi-inverse 
deﬁned  as  fol lows.  Given  a  cochain  in  D ·(X ),  extend  to  a  cochain  on  X  by  mapping  each 
simplex  not  contained  in  some  Ui  to  0. 

This  is  a  standard  if  tedious  calculation;  see  Spanier’s  Algebraic  Topology.

6  Cech  cohomology 

From  the  previous  section,  we  know  that  if  X  is  a  contractible  topological  space,  then  ZX 
is  an  acyclic  sheaf  (because  the  singular  cohomology  of  X  vanishes).  This  can  be  used  to 
compute  the  cohomology  of  X  in  terms  of  the  combinatorics  of  a  good  cover,  i.e.,  an  open 
cover  {Ui}  of X  in  which  each  ﬁnite  intersection  is  contractible.  (You may  have  read  about 
this  in  Bott  and  Tu,  Diﬀerential  Forms  in  Algebraic  Topology.)  We  will  use  the  same  idea 
later  in  order  to  compute  the  cohomology  of  quasicoherent  sheaves  on  schemes. 
Let X  be a topological space, and let U = {Ui }i�I  be an open cover of X  (i.e., each x � X 
appears  in  only  ﬁnitely many Ui ).  For convenience,  let  us  assume  the  set  I  is  equipped  with 
a  total  ordering  (this  helps  straighten  out  some  sign  conventions).  For  each  ﬁnite  subset  J 
of  I ,  put  UJ  = ∈i�J Ui ,  with  the  convention  that  U�  = X . 
Let  F  be  a  sheaf  of  abelian  groups  on  X .  We  deﬁne  the  ˇCech  complex  of  F  deﬁned  by 
the  open  cover  {Ui }  as  follows.  For  j  →  0,  let  Cˇ j (U, F )  be  the  direct  product  of  �(F , UJ ) 
over all (j + 1)-element subsets J  of I .  The diﬀerential dj  : Cˇ j (U, F ) ⊕ Cˇ j+1 (U, F ) is deﬁned 
as  follows:  for  � = (�J ) � Cˇ j (U, F ),  we  have 

dj (�)J  =

j+1 
 
(−1)k ResUJ −{ik },J (�J −{ik } ) 
�
k=0 

J  = {i0  ∩  · · · ∩ ij+1}.

For  instance,  if  there  are  only  two  open  sets  U1  and  U2 ,  then  you  have 

0 ⊕ �(F , U1 ) � �(F , U2 ) ⊕ �(F , U1  ∈ U2 ) ⊕ 0 

where  the  nontrivial  map  is  the  diﬀerence  between  the  two  restrictions.  The  signs  were 
rigged  up  to make  sure  that  this  is  indeed  a  complex:  the  point  is  that  if  you  pull  ij  and  ik 
out  of  a set  J  in  on  order  and multiply  the  two  resulting  signs,  you  get  the  opposite  sign  as 
if  you  pulled  them  out  in  the  opposite  order. 
It  is  an  easy  exercise  to  check  that  this  gives  a  complex,  and  continues  to  do  so  if  you 
insert  �(X, F )  in  front  (with  the  individual  restriction maps  to  Cˇ 0 (U, F ). 
It  is  convenient  to  also  work  with  a  sheaﬁer  analogue  of  this  construction.  Let  Cˇj (U, F ) 
be  the  direct  product  of  jJ �F |UJ  over  all  (j + 1)-element  subsets  J  of  I ,  where  jJ  : UJ  ⊕ X 
is  the  inclusion.  The  global  sections  of  this  are  just  Cˇ j (U, F ). 

Lemma.  The  complex 

is  exact. 

0 ⊕ F  ⊕ Cˇ0 (U, F ) ⊕ Cˇ1 (U, F ) ⊕ · · · 

Proof.  (Compare Hartshorne Lemma III.4.2.)  It suﬃces  to check  exactness  on stalks.  Pick a 
point x � X ; we may  then replace X  by  some Ui  containing x.  In this case, we can construct 
an  explicit  chain  homotopy  k  between  the  identity map  and  the  zero map.  Its  action  can  be 
described  as  follows:  given  a  j -cochain  � = (�J ),  you make  a  (j − 1)-cochain  by  identifying 
�J  with  a  section  of  UJ \{i}  whenever  i  �  J ,  and  discarding  the  �J  whenever  i /�  J .  To  do 
this  correctly,  you  need  to  add  some  signs;  I’ll  leave  this  to  the  Hartshorne  reference. 

We  write  Hˇ ·(U, F ) = h· (Cˇ ·(U, F )).  These  do  not  form  a  cohomological  functor  if  we  ﬁx 
the  choice  of U.  As noted  in Hartshorne Caution  4.0.2,  this  is  clear  for  the  trivial cover  of X 
by  itself  because  the  global  sections  functor  is  not  exact.  However,  they  do  at  least  give  the 
right  answer  in  the  ﬂasque  case.  (They  also  give  the  correct  answer  in  degree  0  no  matter 
what  the  cover,  by  the  sheaf  axiom!) 

Lemma.  If  F  is  ﬂasque,  then  Hˇ i (U, F ) = 0  for  i > 0. 

Proof.  In  the  resolution 

0 ⊕ Cˇ0 (U, F ) ⊕ Cˇ1 (U, F ) ⊕ · · · 
of  F ,  each  term  is  again  ﬂasque  and  hence  acyclic  for  sheaf  cohomology.  If  we  then  take 
global  sections  and  compute  cohomology  of  the  resulting  complex,  on  one  hand  we  just  get 
Hˇ i (U, F ).  On  the  other  hand,  by  the  acyclic  resolution  theorem,  we  are  also  computing 
H i (X, F ),  which  vanishes  for  i > 0. 

On the other hand,  suppose V  is a reﬁnement  of U,  i.e., a new covering {Vj }j�J  equipped 
with  a  map  �  :  J  ⊕  I  of  index  sets  such  that  Vj  ∼  U�(j )  for  all  j  �  J .  Then  we  get  a 
restriction  morphism 

Hˇ · (U, F ) ⊕ Hˇ · (V, F ).

Using  reﬁnements,  the  coverings  of  X  form  a  direct  system,  so  (since  we  are  working  with 
abelian  groups,  which  admit  colimits)  we  can  form  the  direct  limit 

Hˇ · (X, F ) =  lim Hˇ · (U, F ).

U 

Under  certain circumstances,  we  can  show  that this  computes  sheaf  cohomology.  This won’t 
cover  the  case  of  schemes,  but  we’ll  deal  with  that  separately  later. 

Theorem.  Suppose  that  X  is  paracompact,  i.e.,  X  is  Hausdorﬀ  and  every  open  covering 
reﬁnes to a  local ly ﬁnite subcovering.  Then the Hˇ · (X, F )  form a cohomological functor which 
is  eﬀaceable,  hence  universal,  hence  canonical ly  isomorphic  to  H i(X, F ).  In  particular,  for 
any  particular  covering  U,  we  obtain  a  morphism  Hˇ ·(U, F ) ⊕ H · (X, F )  functorial  in  F . 

Proof.  Since X  is paracompact, we need only take the direct limit over locally ﬁnite coverings. 
In  that  case,  the  functors 

F  ⊆⊕ lim Cˇ · (U, F )
−⊕ 
U 
are exact  (exercise).  Given that, we may apply them to a short exact sequence and then take 
the  long  exact  sequence  in  cohomology  to  get  the  connecting  homomorphisms.  Eﬀaceability 
holds because  each F  embeds  into  a  sheaf which  is  injective,  hence  ﬂasque,  hence  acyclic  for 
Hˇ ·(X, ·)  by  an  earlier  lemma. 

All  well  and  good,  but  what  we  really  want  to  know  is,  when  can  we  use  the  ˇCech 
complex  associated  to  a  particular  complex  U  to  compute  the  cohomology  of  F ?  Here  is  a 
useful  answer  in  practice.  We  say  the  cover  U  is  good  for  F  if  for  each  J ,  F |UJ  is  acyclic. 
(No  hypothesis  on X  needed.) 

Theorem  (Leray).  If  U  is  good  for  F ,  then  the  morphisms  Hˇ ·(U, F ) ⊕ H ·(X, F )  are  iso­
morphisms.  That  is,  the  ˇ
ˇ · (U, F )  computes  the  sheaf  cohomology  of  F .
Cech  complex  C

Proof.  As  in  the  proof  that  ˇCech  cohomology  vanishes  for  ﬂasque  sheaves,  it  would  suﬃce 
to  show  that  the  resolution 

0 ⊕ Cˇ0 (U, F ) ⊕ Cˇ1 (U, F ) ⊕ · · · 

is  acyclic.  Unfortunately,  we  can’t  directly  conclude  this  from  the  fact  that  each  F |UJ  is 
acyclic,  because  the  direct  image  jJ �  functor  need  not  be  exact. 
So  instead,  we  argue  by  dimension-shifting.  The  claim  is  evident  for  i =  0  by  the  sheaf 
axiom.  Given  the  claim  for  all  indices  less  than  i,  embed  F  into  an  injective  sheaf  I ,  and 
let  G  be  the  quotient: 

0 ⊕ F  ⊕ I ⊕ G ⊕ 0. 
On  each  UJ , F  and  I  are  acyclic,  so  G  is  as  well  by  the  long  exact  sequence  in  cohomology. 
Moreover,  we  have  short  exact  sequences 

0 ⊕ �(UJ , F ) ⊕ �(UJ , I ) ⊕ �(UJ , G ) ⊕ H 1 (UJ , F ) = 0.

This means  that  not  only  does  this  short  exact  sequence  of  sheaves  give  rise  to  a  long  exact 
sequence  for the H i (X, ·),  it also gives  rise  to a  long exact  sequence  for the Hˇ i (U, ·)  (because 
we  get a  short exact  sequence  of  ˇCech  complexes).  We  thus have  a commuting diagram with 
exact  rows: 

Hˇ i−1(U, I ) 

� Hˇ i−1 (U, G ) 

� Hˇ i (U, F ) 

� Hˇ i (U, I ) 

� �
H i−1 (X, I ) 

� �
H i−1 (X, G ) 

� �

� �
H i(X, F ) 

� �

� �
H i(X, I )

in  which  the  corners  are  zero  (because  injective  implies  ﬂasque,  which  implies  both  the 
ordinary  and  ˇCech  cohomologies  vanish).  So we  transfer  our  question  about F  at  index  i  to 
a  question  about  G  at  index  i − 1,  which  we  know  by  the  induction  hypothesis. 

This  has  practical  applications  outside  of  algebraic  geometry:  you  can  now  use  good 
covers  to  compute  the  singular  cohomology  of  ordinary  topological  spaces!  The  analogue  of 
this  in  algebraic  geometry  will  appear  next,  when  we  start  computing  the  cohomology  of 
quasicoherent  sheaves;  the  analogue  of  contractible  open  subsets  in  the  topological  case  will 
turn  out  to  be  the  aﬃne  schemes,  on  which  quasicoherent  sheaves  will  be  acyclic.
