The Royal Game  of Ur 

Charles  Tam 

February  26,  2008 

The Royal Game  of Ur dates back  to  about 2500 BCE. The  oldest  examples  of  the game  come from  a  cemetery 
excavation in Sumeria (present-day Iraq), but  copies  of the game’s board  and tokens have been found  throughout 
the Middle East and India [1].  A hastily done  etching  of  a game board  appears on the base of  a  sculpture dated 
to  about 700 BCE;  because the  sculpture  was  originally part  of  the  entrance to  a  citadel, this  suggests that the 
game  was  somewhat  casually played [2].  The game is  also known  as the Game  of Twenty Squares;  some hold 
that  the  two  are  the  same,  whereas  others  refer  to  the  Game  of  Twenty  Squares  as  a  descendent  of  the  Royal 
Game  of Ur,  with  similar  rules but  a diﬀerent board layout [6]. 

The  oldest  archeological  ﬁndings  of  this  game  show  ornate  wooden  boards  in  the  conﬁguration  shown  below. 
The  squares  are  decorated  with  various  symbols,  but  reconstructions  of  the  rules  have  only  ever  suggested  the 
importance  of  the  rosette  squares,  marked  as  X’s  in  the  diagram.  Accompanying  the  board  in  some  ﬁnds  were 
seven  tokens  in  each  of  two  diﬀerent  colors,  and  tetrahedral  dice.  Each  of  these  dice  is  colored  red  on  two 
vertices  and  white  on  the  other  two. 

Figure  1:  The  Structure  of  a  Royal  Game  of  Ur  board. 

No  rules for the game have been  established  with  certainty,  so  we  will describe two  reconstructions of  the game 
from  the  Internet,  and  one  that  we  attempted  for  this  exercise.  All  reconstructions  of  the  Royal  Game  of  Ur 
have  agreed  on  several points.  It is  a  race game,  where the  ob jective is to  see  all  of  one’s pieces  onto the board, 
through  a  predetermined  path,  and  oﬀ  the  board.  A  special  roll  of  the  dice  is  required  to  introduce  a  piece  to 
the  board.  When  an  opponent’s  piece  is  landed  on,  it  is  removed  from  the  board  and  must  be  reintroduced 
on  the  starting  square,  unless  it  is  on  one  of  the  rosette  squares.  The  eﬀects  of  dice  rolls  are  determined  by 
how  many  of  them  come  up  white; generally  they  will grant movement points,  which  may  be  used  to  advance  a 
piece by  one  square per point.  Pieces  must  stay  on the designated path  through  the board; pieces  cannot  move 
backwards. 

Sources  disagree  one  what  path  pieces  should  take  through  the  board.  Two  paths  for  one  player  are  suggested 
in  the  diagrams  below;  in  each  game  the  path  for  the  opposing  player  should  be  a  mirror  image  of  the  one 
depicted.

Figure 2:  Possible Traversals for the Ur board [3][4]. 

We  tested  the  following  variations: 

•	 Use the  ﬁrst board path pattern.  Rolling 3  whites or 0  whites grant 5  and 4  movement points respectively, 
or  the  introduction  of  a  token  onto  one’s  starting  square,  or  the  removal  of  a  token  from  one’s  ending 
square;  and  another  turn  regardless  of  which  option  is  chosen.  Rolling  1  white  gives  no  movement,  and 
rolling 2  whites gives one movement point;  both  end  the player’s turn,  and his opponent’s starts.  Multiple 
pieces  may  be present  on  any  square, but they  can  all be bumped by  a  single  opposing piece (unless they 
are  on  a  rosette  square,  which  is  “safe.”).  At  least  one  movement  point,  but  not  all  movement  points, 
must be  used from any  single roll;  no more than  one piece  can use the  movement points provided by  a roll 
[3]. 

Playtesters  expressed  frustration  with  the  ability  to  use  less  than  all  available  movement  points,  as  this 
made pieces not on rosette squares much  easier to bump  oﬀ the board.  This, in turn, led  to players sitting 
on  rosette  squares  until  they  were fortunate  enough  to  receive just  the  right  roll  to  make it  to  the  next 
rosette  square.  There  was  also  some  concern  regarding  that  3/8  of  one’s  turns  are  spent  doing  nothing, 
but  designers  beyond  the  ones  who  created  this  reconstruction  have  been  loath  to  stray  from  the  use  of 
dice  as  binary  digit  generators. 

•	 Path  and  movement  scheme  as  above.  Only  a  single  piece  can  be  present  on  any  non-rosette  square. 
Multiple pieces  may be present without bumping  on the  end  square  and the  rosette  squares.  The  movement 
points provided by  a roll  must all be  allocated  to a single token, if  available, who can make a move of  that 
size  without  running  oﬀ  the  board  or  onto  a  space  occupied  by  a  friendly  piece.  If  no  such  token  exists, 
the  roll is lost.  Bumping  must be performed by  a precise  roll.  Reaching  the last  square  must be  achieved 
by  a  precise  roll,  and  players  still  must  wait  for  an  all-white  or  all-red  roll  to  bear  pieces  oﬀ  the  board. 

Gameplay  felt  very  determined  by  randomness  at  the  beginning  and  end  of  the  game,  where  each  player 
had few pieces on the board.  However, players put took their time  ﬁguring out their best  move in midgame, 
and  this  investment  of  decision-making  made  endgame  randomness  more  worthwhile  and  exciting.  One 
iteration, however,  saw  the players getting  exasperated  with  the  amount  of  rolling  required  to get  a precise 
roll  for  their  last  pieces  to  reach  the  end  square,  and  then  more  rolling  to  get  the  all-white/all-red  roll 
needed  to  ﬁnish  the  game.  Another  revision  of  the  rules  removing  the  extra  roll  to  remove  a  piece  saw 
much  faster  games,  but  less  suspense.

•	 Use  the  second board path pattern.  Rolling 3, 2,  or 0 whites  allows 5, 1,  or 4  movement points  respectively. 
Rolling 3  whites  alternatively  allows  one  to introduce  a piece  to  the board.  A  roll  of 1  white  ends  a player’s 
turn (note that  none  of the  other  rolls do  so).  Only  one piece  may  occupy  any  square.  All  movement 
points from  a  roll  must be  used  on  exactly  one piece,  whose  movement of  that  many  squares does  not  end 
on  a  square  already  occupied  by  a  friendly  token.  If  no  such  piece  exists,  the  movement  points  are  lost. 
Landing  exactly  on  any  rosette  allows the player to introduce  another token  on the  starting  square  of  the 
board.  Landing  exactly  on the last  rosette brings the piece  oﬀ the board  automatically [4]. 

The  initial  anticipation  of  longer  turns  quickly  gave  way  to  the  frustration  of  not  having  any  movable 
pieces.  Since  of  all  the  movement  rolls,  2  was  the  most likely, pieces  ended  up  occupying  modulo-4  squares 
more  often  than  anything  else.  This  also  led  to  pieces  becoming  congested  at  the  end  of  the  track,  where 
an  exact  roll  was  required  to  remove  a  piece  and  the  piece  was  fewer  than  four  squares  away  from  the 
ﬁnish. 

Of  the  three  variants  tested, players found  that  the  second  was  most  satisfactory,  as it  allowed for  an  appropriate 
balance  of  player  interaction  and  randomness.
