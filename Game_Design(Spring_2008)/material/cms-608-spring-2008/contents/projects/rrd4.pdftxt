Project 4 

Tension. It 's the key to every competitive game. It hangs over the final table of Poker 

tournaments. It prevents you from sitting down when there's five seconds left and your team is 

down by one. Without  it, sports wouldn't be entertainment, players would quit games halfway 

through, and our lives would be much, much poorer. Our goal for this project was to design a 

game that maintains tension throughout  the whole game, so that players are constantly engaged. 

For tension to run high on every turn, there has to be uncertainty about who is going to win the 

game, up until the very last  turn. On top of that, every action has to be critical to the outcome of 

the game in a very tangible way - simply compiling resources is not a strategy that requires a 

player to be on his or her toes. There are excellent examples of games that already exist  that are 

extremely intense on each turn: Jenga for example forces the player to focus all the time because 

any one move could lose the game for them. Likewise, Russian Roulette is constantly intense 

because the game could be over at any moment (for a less violent  image, picture people playing 

Hot Potato). However, these games usually end because of pure chance or because some player 

does something wrong - we set a secondary goal for this game, to make it winnable through 

positive player action. 

We approached this game from the player's point of view, focusing first not on a specific 

Mechanic, but on what Aesthetic we wanted to game to have. We learned much from Marc 

LeBlanc, and used his MDA design approach (Hunicke) as well as his philosophy of "failing 

quickly." However, it became clear even before we started testing out mechanics that  there would 

be some significant constraints upon them. First of all, each player needs to have potential to 

clearly affect  the outcome of the game on each and every turn. This meant  that we could not have 

a winning condition with any sort of point system, unless very few points were needed to win. To 

maintain the tension, we also needed to make sure that EVERY player was involved ALL the 

time, instead of taking their turn and then dozing off for a bit. Of course, if a game can be won on 

any turn, usually players are going to try as hard as they can to make the most out of each turn, so 

if there is a lot of information available, and the mechanics and strategies are complex, players 

could take a long time while deciding what  to do. This would lead to the other players becoming 

bored, so we tried to keep the Mechanics of the game simple, the strategies obvious, and the 

information limited. 

Thus, we began with a simple Mechanic - trading in cards to try and build a winning hand. 

In order to make it based upon a skill, and not  luck, we allowed players to draw cards that had 

already been discarded, so they could use their memory to their advantage. The first  iteration of 

the game consisted of a deck of cards being laid out face down in a grid, except  that each player 

held 5 cards. Players traded cards in one at a time to get new ones, attempting to build a straight 

flush. This game was not very fun, it was quite difficult, and there was almost not  tension because 

it was so unlikely that anyone could actually accomplish the goal (even with an excellent memory, 

odds are it would take a couple dozen turns). 

We decided to eliminate a portion of the deck and turn half the cards face-up so that  it 

would be easier for players to build up their hands. We tried this two ways, and neither one 

worked that well. In one version, you had to replace a face-up card with another face-up card. In 

this game, players had virtually identical sets of knowledge, and it was easy to tell what  the other 

player was going for. This version was dominated by information that was known to all players, 

and so it  turned into more of a pure strategy game. Games with Perfect Information (Salen and 

Zimmerman, ch 17), like chess, tend to lose their tension when it becomes obvious that one player 

is going win, and this actually happened during some of our tests (of course it was not a game of 

perfect  information, but  the vast majority of cards that were chosen were face-up). The other way 

we played was to replace face-up cards with face-down ones and vice versa. The dominant 

strategy was obvious - picking a face-up card meant you knew what you were getting, AND your 

opponents had no idea what you were throwing away. This led to more and more of the cards 

being face-down, so that  it became HARDER to win the game as play progressed. This killed the 

tension because it was frustrating to be moving backwards, away from your goal. 

We realized that 1) that players needed to be constantly gaining information so that a 

winning hand would become increasingly likely and 2) that not every turn is a potential victory if 

players may only turn in one card at a time. We tried allowing players to trade as many of their 

cards in as they would like, and the game still proved challenging, so we ran with that. We also 

kept all the cards face down, but required players to reveal what cards were being placed in the 

grid. The benefit of this Mechanic is that all players have to pay attention to what  the other 

players are doing during their turns, or else they forfeit  their only source of information. Also, all 

players have EXACTLY the same amount of information about what cards are currently in the 

grid (assuming they don't forget), so the longer a game goes without a winner, the more nervous 

everyone will become that other players remember more than they do. This is a key Mechanic 

from the games Memory and Stratego - ideally the player gains more information as the game 

progresses, but  the result of turning over a card that has just been discarded gradually turns from 

a Certain outcome into a Risk, and then into an Uncertain outcome again (Salen and Zimmerman, 

Ch 15). In practice, this game is quite draining - it requires much more concentration to play well 

than any other game we've encountered. However, we were trying to make a game that kept 

players involved, and this system certainly did that, so we kept  it. 

The final iteration involved the creation of intermediate goals. The variance in time it  took 

to get a straight flush was too long - it could take a few turns or it could take ages to reveal the 

necessary cards. We introduced other goals that each player had to accomplish before moving on: 

getting a straight, getting a flush, and getting four of a kind. These subgoals represented 

"Closures" but not "End Conditions" (Bjork and Holopainen, 419) - they were meaningful 

transitions that changed what  the players were trying to accomplish, but not eliminate anyone or 

feel that  they had lost. Revealing ones successful collection of a straight or four of a kind signals 

to the other players that your goals have changed. Technically, four of a kinds are less likely to be 

randomly drawn than straight flushes using our abbreviated deck, but we wanted to make sure 

that players could not carry over more than a couple of cards from one goal to the next one. This 

forces players to not  look too far ahead when planning, and to keep the game moving. It also 

causes players to concentrate on information that  is only relevant for part of the game. For 

example, you would concentrate on keeping track of certain numbers when trying to obtain a 

straight, but after you do, all you care about  is suit  to get a flush. Unfortunately, you probably 

haven't been looking at  the suits closely. 

The ordering of the goals made it successively harder to progress, so that other players 

usually caught up to the leader. One property that we did not forsee was the importance of 4s, as 

they essential for any straight  in a 3-person game. Several times, players going for four of a kind 

were able to temporarily block players going for straight flushes by hoarding the 4s. This is a 

good example of negative feedback (Hunicke), which was essential for keeping matches close and 

maintaining our competitive tension. 

Play-testing revealed a surprising amount of desire within players to continue certain 

mechanics of game-play even after a winner had already been determined.  Our game mechanics 

permit a player to take a card from the grid (Hunicke 3-4).  When this occurs, a player gains a 

piece of information: the identity of a card (Salen Zimmerman 205-208).  During play-testing, 

following the determination of an overall game winner, players would flip over grid cards in an 

intense and determined attempt  to uncover a pesky card that had eluded detection for quite some 

time.  For this degree of emotion and willingness to continue game mechanics to exist, unresolved 

tension must be present.  According to Salen and Zimmerman, meaningful play could still exist 

past  the point of an overall winner being determined because of the remaining tension.  The 

potential for meaningful play is derived from unresolved dramatic tension and uncertainty in form 

of the location of a particular card (388). 

The location of a card serves two purposes: as a source of conflict between two opposing 

players vying for a certain card, and as a source of conflict between a single player and a system 

which sneakily hides the object of desire.  Two games emerge from this situation: one against 

opposing players, one against  the system (Salen, Zimmerman 250).  Discovering who the overall 

winner is of the overall game only partially removes uncertainty in the minds of players.  Although 

one player may be removed from the contest and declared the winner, conflicts between players 

and the system may remain.  As play-testing has revealed, players still had a desire to acquire the 

information necessary to beat  the system.  As a consolation to the main game, players may 

continue game play in an attempt  to beat  the system.  Subsequently, the order in which players 

resolve their conflict with the system determines second, third, and possibly fourth place end 

positions with regards to the overall game.  Having beaten the system, meaning can still exist for 

the player who finishes in last place. 

However, continuing game-play beyond the point where a player is declared the overall 

winner is not always a viably fun option. With only eight cards in a suit and only four suits in the 

game, a situation may arise where two players are attempting to obtain a straight-flush within the 

same suit.  Were either of these players to be declared the overall winner, there would be a 

significantly large possibility that  the winning player will possess cards necessary for the 

none-winning player to achieve a straight-flush within a suit.  In other words, the other player 

cannot possibly win in the conflict against an opponent or the system by pursuing a straight-flush 

in the same suit as the winner.  Furthermore, dramatic tension for the non-winner is all but 

diminished when the winner reveals his cards, confirming the location of an elusive card.  With no 

dramatic tension and a lack of uncertainty, meaningful play cannot occur (Salen Zimmerman 388). 

Continuing play enacts harsh positive feedback on the non-winning player, risking disenchantment 

and apathy by forcing this player to give up all his cards and pursue a straight-flush of an entirely 

different suit.  Essentially, this player must start an entirely new game against  the system (215).  It 

is therefore our recommendation that rather than risking player disenchantment, the continuance 

of play to determine second, third, and fourth places should be an entirely optional extension of 

our original game. 

Our card game was always meant  to maintain and build tension as the game progressed. 

Players were to be fairly rewarded for their strategic moves only to the extent of a perceivable 

temporary advantage.  Other players must always feel that  they can easily catch up fairly as a 

direct result of their own achievements, not fear punishment from other players, and not be 

disastrously penalized for committing a mistakes.  The end result of our play-testing was a 

memory based card game with objectives arranged in such a way that a clear yet  tricky path to 

victory existed which built  tension and rewarded skill but prevented players from falling 

irrecoverably behind.  In order to maximize the use of the dramatic tension created from the game 

while staying true to the idea of a game that does not punish, continuing the game to discover 

who places second, third, and fourth should be optional.  Our group is very satisfied that we could 

produce a non-wussified competitive and engaging casual card game. 

Materials:

-Standard 52 card deck

-3 player game uses all cards Ace through 7 [A,2,3,4,5,6,7]

-4 player game uses all cards Ace through 8 [A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]


Setup:

-All players are dealt an initial hand of 4 cards. Players may look at  their own cards.

-Remaining cards are set up in a 4x4 grid formation, face down.


Gameplay:

-Player to the left of the dealer goes first.

-A player is allowed to trade up to 4 of their cards with cards in the grid.

-Any Cards being traded in must be shown to the group prior a player picking new cards

-Traded cards remain face up until they are reincorporated into the grid at  the end of a player's

turn.

-Cards being taken from the grid do not need to be shown to the group.

-The trade process may only occur once per turn per player.


Objective:

-Players must obtain the following hands in the following order to win: Straight, Flush,

4-of-a-kind, Straight-Flush.

-Players must show their hands to the group immediately after achieving any of the

aforementioned special hands.

-Obtaining a Straight-Flush when the current objective is to obtain a Straight does not constitute

advancement  to the 4-of-a-kind objective.

-Players may continue to play for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th places only if the group agrees to do so.
