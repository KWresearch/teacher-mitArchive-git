Roller Derby 

Skates.  Speed.  Getting smashed face first in to the wall.  What could be better? 

For our project we decided to build a board game on the awesome sport that is roller 

derby.  Translating the awesome and fun aspects of roller derby into the comparatively 

slower (not to mention less physically challenging) realm of board games, however, 

actually turned out to be a bit of a challenge.  Some parts of the design process, such as 

the general design of the board as a round track, were easy.  On the other hand, how to 

treat the parts of the game, like fouls and assists, that bring a lot of the life and action to 

the real sport proved to be a bit of a struggle. 

In the first iteration of our play, the rules were extremely simple.  All we had 

really decided was that it would be a two player game where each player would control 

five pieces (one jammer and four blockers) in their effort to gain the most points over the 

course of two sessions or “jams” composed of fifteen turns each.  At the time we had also 

decided upon the movement of the pieces as counter clock-wise around the board where 

the number of spaces moved was determined by the roll of one dice for the blockers and 

one for the jammer.  We hadn’t really decided what we wanted to do with fouls and 

assists other than we did, indeed, want to incorporate them into the game.  However, we 

felt that playing the game as soon as possible, just like we discussed in class during the 

Robot vs. Tank exercise, was important to get a feel for the game. 

It quickly became clear that even though we did have a good base mechanic, there 

was a lot lacking in the interaction between players.  As one of our readings indicated, 

games should be able to be treated as systems of conflict and our game at the time did not 

have many ways to interact with the other player and, as a result, was really not a strong 

game (Salen and Zimmermann, 2006).  We needed to create a way for drama to naturally 

occur between the players.  In order to facilitate the drama, we placed foul spaces 

randomly around the board and decided that a player would be fouled if they landed on or 

passed through a foul space.  After play-testing, it turned out that the second part of that 

rule was actually just as important, if not more important, than the first part because it 

resulted in a slight emergent strategy: if a player could block using their pieces just right 

he could actually force the other player to move through a foul spot and take a foul.  For 

example, in Figure 1, if all of the blue pieces have already been pushed once, the red 

piece is forced to move into the foul space.

Figure 1: Forced Foul 

Once the players realized they could do this, they often combined this with the 

action of splitting up the opponent’s pieces such that the opposing piece also got a 

penalty for being too far away from its fellows.  In this way, if played correctly, one 

player could force another to take a lot of fouls.  The next step with fouls was relatively 

easy.  We knew from normal roller derby that if enough fouls were accumulated by any 

one team, then they went to the penalty box for a set period of time so it was not very 

difficult to make the jump from that real-world action to putting a piece in the penalty 

box for a few turns after four fouls. 

The next item we needed to implement to help out with the player conflict was the 

assist cards and the normal interaction between pieces on the board.  We decided early on 

that there should be some sort of physical interaction between the pieces that was simple 

enough not to require an assist card – after all, not all physical interaction between roller 

derby players is intense enough to warrant special attention.  Some of the interaction is 

just a bit of jostling between players.  We decided the perfect way to implement this was 

a simple pushing mechanic between pieces that made it so that blockers could push 

blockers on their own team, blockers on the opponent’s team, or the jammer on either 

team forward one space given that the piece being pushed had not been pushed once 

already.  Pieces can be pushed one space diagonally to another track or may be pushed 

one space forward.  Since the movement of the blockers on a team was constrained to the 

value of the dice rolled, adding a mechanic under which a player, if clever, could get a 

good amount of extra moves proved to be an awesome addition because it added a lot of 

strategy to blocker movement. 

The assist cards, on the other hand, ended up being a little more difficult to decide 

upon.  Making it so that the players only got assist cards when they landed on a certain 

place on the board was our first idea.  However, we eventually dismissed the idea as 

lacking if implemented alone simply because it would make it possible for one of the 

players to never get an assist cards.  Since we were aiming for a sense of player 

interaction and conflict that mimicked real roller derby matches, having it so that the 

aggression was only one sided did not fit.  As a result, we decided to implement the idea 

that in addition to the ability to get assist cards by landing on certain spots on the board, 

players would also receive one assist card every three turns with the exception of the first 

turn when they would receive two to start off the game.  Initially, the assist cards 

themselves were decided to be Brake (resisting a push), Carry (blocker carrying a 

jammer), Hard Push (push an opposing player out of bounds for one turn), and Swing 

(blocker swings the jammer from behind them to any open space in front of them). 

After play testing it again with our rule-changes to fouls and assists, we found yet 

another change that needed to be made: the speed of the jammer.  At this point the 

jammer movement was calculated by the roll of one dice and the cumulative possible 

movement of the blockers was also determined by the roll of one dice.  With only one 

dice, not only did both the blockers and the jammers move slowly, but the jammers had 

an extremely hard time passing the blockers.  What this meant was that we ended up with 

a really slow (and boring) progression of pieces around the board with no points being 

scored.  After realizing that this was a fairly large problem for our game, we ended up 

going through multiple iterations of play-testing both by ourselves and with other people 

to find the best combination of dice for the blockers and the jammers.  We quickly found 

out that one die for the blockers and two for the jammers was still extremely slow even 

though the jammers were more often able to actually pass the blockers.  We went from 

one die for blockers and two for jammers to two for each in an effort to make everything 

faster.  This had some measure of success.  However, after play-testing with friends who 

had never seen the game before, we decided that the jammers were once again having a 

hard time lapping the blockers so we added a third, and final, die to their count.  So, in 

the end, we were left with two die for the blocker movement and three for the jammer. 

This ended up giving a nice balance between relatively quick overall movement around 

the board by the blockers while still giving the jammers enough leeway to still lap them 

and gain points. 

We hit upon another idea not through play-testing but during Jesper Juul’s lecture 

on rule-breaking.  During the class we had to do an exercise where we introduced the 

ability to break the rules in our game.  We actually found this difficult to implement 

because every time we thought of a cool way to “break our rules,” it centered around 

making a rule to allow for breaking the rules which defeated the purpose.  In the end we 

toyed with two ideas: Distract the Referee and Break the Rules.  The Break the Rules 

card would allow the player to do just what it sounds like.  The player could play the card 

and basically do what they wanted within reasonable boundaries that would be decided 

by the players themselves the course of the game.  This allowed us to not really define a 

“rule” for breaking the rules while still allowing an opening for breaking the rules we 

created.  On the other hand, Distract the Referee went right along with the actual fiction 

of the game of roller derby and involved deliberately ignoring a foul or getting out of the 

penalty box before your time was out.  This assist card, as opposed to the Break the Rules 

card, was actually defined and so did not really constitute as breaking the rules in quite 

the same way.  However, after play-testing, we realized that the Break the Rules card was 

really too powerful and we did not think it went well with the balance of the game.  On 

the other hand, Distract the Referee went perfectly, so we kept it for the final rule-set.  In 

addition, the idea of cheating made us think more about sneaking around the rules and 

eventually led to the Camouflage card that allows a jammer to move amongst the 

blockers of another team. 

Over the course of one of our final play-tests, we once again returned to a debate 

that we had after every play-test.  Exactly what are the bounds of pushing another piece 

without an assist card?  We were able to agree on the fact that there should be some limit 

to how far one piece can push another, but had trouble deciding upon exactly what the 

limit should be.  If there was not a limit one player could line up all of their pieces and 

then just use the piece at the end to push all of the others around the board.  What we had 

been initially unable to decide was whether we should have it such that each piece can 

only be pushed once per turn or such that each piece can only push once per turn. 

Eventually, however, we did decide to have it so that each piece can only be pushed once 

per turn.  This made it so that there are eight potential pushes per turn (if you ignore the 

jammers) versus the four possible moves if each blocker is only allowed to push once per 

turn.  We felt that having more possible pushes made for a much more dynamic game in 

addition to a game more in tune with the fiction of the game itself. 

Another change we initiated after play-testing, and that happened to parallel one 

of the rules in the 400 Project Rule List, was shortening the length of a jam and re-

arranging how the turns were allotted during the jam to reduce player fatigue (Falstein 

and Barwood, 2006).  In the earlier iterations, we had fifteen total turns plus one 

additional turn where the blockers were allowed to move by themselves so that they 

would get a head start on the jammers just like in real roller derby.  This turned out to be 

fairly tedious and unnecessary since, on the one hand, the players could end up playing 

all sixteen rounds with each round taking at least a couple of minutes or, if the players 

were good, the lead jammer could call off both jams right away and never get past the 

fifth or sixth turn.  In addition, allowing the blockers to get only a one turn head start 

made it so that if one person won the first jam and was able to go first and get his jammer 

in front of the blockers right away then he could call off the second jam before the other 

player made any moves.  To battle the tedious aspect of the fifteen turns, we shortened 

each session to six turns, and to cope with the clear advantage to the winner of the first 

jam, we made it so that the first two turns of the total six were devoted to blocker 

movement.  The latter made it so that even if one player won the first jam and went first 

in the second jam, the other player still had some sort of chance to get past him and 

continue the game. 

In the end, we feel like we managed to make a game that was not only true to the 

sport itself, but also fun and engaging.  The mechanics of the game and the interaction 

that it both allows and encourages makes it so that the game is a nice balance between 

strategy and chance.  After all, you could plan out your pushes and moves to put your 

players in an optimal position, but the chance aspect of rolling the die and receiving assist 

cards ensures that your opponent could at any point Hard Push you into a wall.
