Second Essay: Design a Clubhouse Game Variant  

 

Design a new variant of a classic clubhouse game (e.g. Cribbage, Poker, Bridge, Blackjack, 
Rummy) playable using a standard poker deck and chips. Applying the topics and methods 
that we have discussed in class, playtest the game extensively and document any changes 
that you made to the game. Investigate similar variants, if any, and aim to create something 
unique. 

In the paper, you should analyze the game and address your playtest processâ€”what problems 
you came across and how you tried to solve them; what the outcomes of your playtesting 
were; how changes in the rules generated different dynamics and if these created a different 
experience. 

Remember! Make references to the class readings and use the terminology and techniques 
introduced in class. 

In your paper, do not forget to include the different versions of your game rules, the outcomes 
of your testing, and any amendments you made. Diagrams are encouraged. 1500-3000 words. 
Due in Lec #16.
