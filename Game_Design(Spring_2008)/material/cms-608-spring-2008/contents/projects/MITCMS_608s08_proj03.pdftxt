First Team Project: Adapt a Non-Board Game  

 

In teams of 3 or 4, design a board game that's an adaptation of a non-board game, e.g. 
sports, game shows, videogames, card games, or playground games. Your game may require 
between two to four players. If it can accommodate a variable number of players, state any 
rule changes necessary for different-sized groups. You may use up to five six-sided dice. You 
may require the players to provide up to six different colors of generic, identically-shaped 
tokens in any quantity. (We will test your game by having six different colors of beads on 
hand.) If your game requires play money, recommend the quantity of denominations of the 
currency for an ideal number of players. Your submission should include your game rules, 
token/dice requirements, game board, and any custom cards submitted in hardcopy and PDF 
format. Due in Lec #25. 

Your submission should also include a paper between 1500 and 3000 words. Applying the 
topics and methods that we have discussed in class, playtest the game extensively and 
document any changes that you made to the game. Analyze the game and address your 
playtest processâ€”what problems you came across and how you tried to solve them; what the 
outcomes of your playtesting were; how changes in the rules generated different dynamics 
and if these created a different experience. 

Remember! Make references to relevant class readings and use the terminology and 
techniques introduced in class. 

In your paper, do not forget to include the different versions of your game rules, the outcomes 
of your testing, and any amendments you made. Diagrams are required.
