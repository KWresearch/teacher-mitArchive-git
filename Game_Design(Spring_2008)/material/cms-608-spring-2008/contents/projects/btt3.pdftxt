Fluxx:  The Board Game 

Sharat  Bhat, Charles  Tam,  Karena  Tyan

Concept 

Fluxx in its  original form is  a  card game  noted for being  very  easy  to pick  up  and play, both in  the  sense  that  the 

rules  are  simple  and presented  unambiguously  on the  relevant  cards,  and  that the game is  small, portable,  and 
allows for  a varying  number of players even  within a single iteration of  the game.  The  card  types include Rules, 

which determine the current  “rules of play”; Actions, which have an eﬀect when played  and  then are discarded; 

and  Keepers  and  Goals,  which  determine  the  winner(s)  of  the  game.  The  winning  conditions  are  dictated  on 
each  Goal  card  and  typically  feature  some  combination  of  Keeper  cards.  The  only  meta-rules  are  that  when 

a player  enters  the game, he draws  three  cards  and  adds himself  to  the  circle  of players (this  applies both  to 
starting  the  game  and  to  adding  a  player  in  mid-game),  that  play  occurs  in  a  turn-based  fashion  proceeding 

around  the circle of players, and  that a player’s turn is composed  of  ﬁrst Drawing, then Playing. 

Our  adaptation  of  Fluxx  as  a  board  game  aimed  to  preserve  the  ﬂuid  nature  of  the  game  as  much  as  possible. 
The  idiomatic  “Draw  1  Play  1”  changed  to  “Draw  1  Place  1  Move  1.”  The  game  now  requires  a  board  and 

tokens.  Instead  of  Playing  cards  so  that  they  immediately  have  eﬀect,  cards  are  Placed  onto  the  board.  Then, 
in  order to  activate  an Action  card,  a token  must land  on  or be  moved  over it.  Similarly,  a player is  considered 

to  be  in  possession  of  a  Keeper  only  when  he  has  a  token  on  it.  Note  that  this  means  that  multiple  players  can 
be  in  possession  of  a  Keeper,  or  that  a  single  player  can  own  multiple  instances  of  the  same  Keeper.  If  a  Goal 

is  met  by  multiple  players,  then  all  those  players  win. 

Our  board  game  version  of  Fluxx  diﬀers  from  the  original  primarily  through  the  additional  layer  of  strategy 
provided by  the physical layout  of  the  cards and  the  availability  of Placed Action  cards to  any player.  Whereas 

in  the  Fluxx  card  game,  Action  cards  are  Played  by  one  player  immediately  from  their  hand,  our  board  game 
version both  delays  the  eﬀects  of  Action  cards  and  makes  them  available  to  all players  within  reach  once Placed. 

Board game Fluxx also leaves you more vulnerable to retaliation or blocked  movement if  the  “None Shall Pass” 
rule is in play.  Players  can decide  the  order  they  use  their Place  and Move  options,  allowing  them  some  measure 

of  immediate  eﬀect  from  Actions  placed.  Players  will  generally  Place  beneﬁcial  Actions  in  the  path  of  their 
tokens.  However, players can also hinder opponents by  Moving  ﬁrst and Placing  oﬀensive Actions in their trail 

to  discourage  pursuers.  Furthermore,  as  players  are  forced  to  show  their  strategy  by  laying  out  Action  cards 

on  the  board,  opponents  have  the  potential  to  pre-empt  those  strategies,  if  the  number  of  Moves  available  to 
the  Placing  player  is  less  than  the  number  of  cards  the  player  wishes  to  activate.  In  general,  the  board  game 

version  of Fluxx  allows for  spatial  strategy  and  more interaction  amongst players than the  card  version. 

Since  our  game  was  designed  to  give  the  experience  of  playing  Fluxx  in  a  board  game,  most  of  the  design 
centered  around  recreating  the  the  aesthetic  experience  of  the  original  Fluxx  card  game.  We  tried  to  create 

gameplay  mechanics  that  ﬁt  in  with  the  original  game’s  feeling  of  constant  change.  As  a  result  we  made  the 

1 

board  change  as  cards  are  placed  onto  it.  The  mechanics  were  largely  created  to  match  the  aesthetics  of  the 

original  game.  The  token  limit  was  added  to  add  an  analogy  to  the  Keeper  limit  and  several  other  cards  were 
added  almost  directly  from  the  original  Fluxx  game.  In  order  to  add  our  own  bit  of  personality  to  the  game 

without  compromising  the  feel  of  the  card  game,  we  changed  to  Keepers  and  Goals  to  be  more  relevant  to  our 
lives.  We  later  had  to  adjust  the  mechanics  to  balance  the  game  and  match  the  strategies  in  the  original  Fluxx 

game, but  overall our goal  was to create mechanics that created  an environment that felt the  same as the Fluxx 
card  game.

To  keep  with  the  general  concept  of  Fluxx,  we  allowed  the  shape  and  size  of  the  board  to  change  during  play. 
At the beginning  of  the game, the board  consisted  of  only  nine  “seed”  squares (Figure 1).  The board  could be 

expanded  by  playing  Actions  and  Keepers  to  locations  adjacent  to  existing  tiles.  To  limit  board  growth,  each 
player could  only  Place Actions  adjacent to his  own tokens;  consequentially, tokens  could  only  move to parts  of 

the  board  that  had  already  been  created  by  Placing  and  “blanking”  cards.  We  also  considered  the  possibility 
of destroying portions  of  the board.  Action  cards designed for this purpose drew  a distinction between  erasing 

a  tile,  which  removed  the  Keeper  or  Action  residing  in  a  location  but  left  a  blank  tile  there;  and  deleting  a 

2 

tile,  which  removed  the  tile  itself  and  any  cards  or  tokens  occupying  that  location.  We  were  focused  more  on 

mechanics  this  game,  so  we  played  with  the  Keepers  and  Goals  deﬁned  in  normal  Fluxx.  We  also  used  most  of 
the  Rules  and  Actions  therein,  but  some  of  them  had  to  be  modiﬁed  to  ﬁt  with  the  idiom  of  the  board  game1 . 
For example, Keeper Limit cards were changed  to Token Limit  cards, thus imposing  a hard limit  on the number 
of Keepers  a player  could possess, but in  a diﬀerent  manner.  We  also  added  cards  that  allowed for  token  creation 

and  deletion. 

Generally  speaking,  the biggest  shortcoming  of  this iteration  was  the lack  of interaction between player’s  tokens. 
Players  would  still  use  Actions  to  swap  hands,  or  create  chains  of  drawing  and  placing,  as  they  would  have  in 

normal  Fluxx.  However,  the  unlimited  growth  of  the  board  led  players  to  separate  from  one  another;  after  six 
or  seven turns,  each player would  create his  own branch  of  tiles  and  remain isolated  there (Figure 2).  Basically, 

players grew to be too far  apart from  each  other,  and there  was  very  little they  could do to  each  other beyond 
the  hand  manipulation  that  original  Fluxx  featured.  To  remedy  this,  we  limited  the  size  of  the  board  to  11  by 

11,  and  introduced  more  oﬀensive  cards  to  the  deck.

Second  Iteration 

For  this  iteration,  the  board  size  was  ﬁxed  to  11  by  11.  The  center  of  the  board  was  arranged  as  before,  but 

all  squares  started  the  game  as  blank.  Deletion  cards  were  changed  so  that  they  diﬀered  from  erasure  only  in 
that  they  also  destroyed  any  tokens  occupying  the  target  tile.  We  changed  the  rules  so  that  cards  could  now 

be placed  anywhere  on the board  since  we  no longer had  to  worry  about players placing  inﬁnite distances  away 

from  other  units.  Three Rules  were  added  to the deck: Move 1d6, No Token Bonus (in the  same  vein  as the No 
Hand Bonus), and Jump.  “Land Mine”  was changed  to  “Blight”  to better describe its eﬀect on the surrounding 

tiles.  We  changed  the  three-of-each-Action  distribution  of  cards  to  promote  those  cards  that  encouraged  token 
interactions  and Drawing (everyone likes drawing!).  We  added Actions like Destroy This Token  and Aversion 

that  actually  harmed  the  player  that  landed  on  them.  This  was  to  allow  players  to  engage  in  a  territory-based 
game without  resulting in the  sort of isolation in the previous iteration (Figure 3).  We  replaced the  original 

Fluxx  set  of  Keepers  with  10  Keepers  and  14  Goals  of  our  own  making.  The  Goals  were  themed  toward  MIT 
jokes (e.g.  Mens Et Manus, own the Mind  and Hand Keepers to win),  and  also toward  using  mechanics that 

were  not present in the  original Fluxx deck (e.g.  Time Paradox,  remove the Time Keeper from  under  a token 
to  win). 

Playtests for this iteration had  a lot of  action.  Players enjoyed  chaining large numbers of Actions, in  some cases

for multiple turns.  However, there were not  enough Keepers  – they  only  comprise 1/17  of  the deck  – and  victory 

stayed  out  of  reach  for  so  long  that  we  called  a  halt  to  the  game.  The  fact  that  the  edges  of  the  board  were 
very  rarely  used,  even  with  four  players  putting  as  many  cards  on  the  board  as  they  possibly  could,  suggested 

that  the  board  was  still  too  large. 

4 

Third  Iteration 

Our third iteration  only addressed the issue  of Keeper  shortage,  since having  a  suﬃcient  number  could potentially 

resolve  the  issue  of  board  size.  We played  on  an  11  by  11 board,  and  added  5 Keepers  and  11 Goals  to  the  deck. 
We changed  “Liberate A Keeper”  to  “Obliterate A Keeper”  to avoid the extraneous political joke, and  “King 

of  the  Hill”  to  “None  Shall  Pass”  to  better  convey  the  primary  function  of  that  Rule. 

This iteration still had too few Keepers  – Keepers showed up  more frequently  than before, but  now had  the large 
supply  of  Keeper-destroying  Actions  to  contend  with.  It  also  became  apparent  in  this  iteration  that  our  Draw, 

Move,  Play,  and  Token  Limit  were  set  too  high;  after  X  =  X  +  1,  Draw  5,  Place  4,  and  Move  6  came  into  play, 
dealing  with long  chains  of Actions became  more tedious than fun.  In playtesting,  we included players who  not 

only  had  never  played  our  game,  but  had  also  never  played  Fluxx.  This  highlighted  the  necessity  of  rewording 

descriptions  on  some  of the  cards (especially  the Jump  card).  It  also brought  up  the implicit  rule  assumed by 
all  Fluxx  veterans  –  that  one  should  Draw  ﬁrst,  then  Place,  then  Move.  Because  the  rules  did  not  prevent  it, 

our  new  player  used  a  strategy  in  which  he  staggered  Placing  and  Moving,  leading  to  more  immediate  eﬀects 
from  Placed  Action  cards. 

We  rebalanced  the  Action  quantities  to  more  strongly  favor  token-manipulation  cards  and  disfavor  Keeper-

destruction  cards.  We  eliminated  the  highest-quantity  Draw,  Move,  and  Place  Rules  to  alleviate  the  tedium  of 
regularly  dealing  with  extraordinarily  long  moves.  We  reduced  our  11x11  board  to  a  9x9  grid  for  the  reasons 

cited  in  previous  iterations:  to  encourage  territory  battles  and  to  allow  cards  to  be  resized  to  a  more  playable 
size  without  drastically  increasing  board  size.  Our  attention  was  also  drawn  to  the  unexpected  eﬀects  of  the  X 

=  X  +  1  Rule  on  some  cards,  which  unbalanced  Actions  and  Rules  and  led  to  tediously  long  player  turns.  We 
clariﬁed  the  meta-rule  for  when  a  player  has  no  tokens  remaining  on  the  board  to  allow  the  player  to  spawn 

one  new  token  on  the  center  square  of  the  board  at  the  beginning  of  his/her  turn.  We  eliminated  the  Move  1d6 
rule, as it was the only  card  to use dice and  required  awkward phrasing  to avoid  application of X  = X+1. 

We  also  realized  only  after  playtesting  this  iteration  that  we  had  been  following  an  implicit  meta-rule  to  Place 

all  cards before Moving  was allowed.  When  we realized  that it  was never stated  we decided in favor of  removing 
it  altogether  since  it  was  an  unnecessary  meta-rule  that  led  to  play  diﬀerent  from  original  Fluxx.  Since  Goal 

and Rule cards are  “activated”  as soon as they  were Placed, players did  not have the option to use Action cards 
before  them,  even  if  using  that  Goal  card  could  cause  someone  else  to  win.  The  simplest  example  of  this  is  if  a 

player  has  a  token  right  next  to  a  Trash  a  Keeper  square  but  is  forced  to  Place  a  Goal  that  gives  someone  else 
the  victory  for  one  of  the  keepers  they  have.  The  more  immediate  eﬀect  of  Action  cards  allowed  for  defensive 

strategies  that  had  been  impossible  with  the  earlier  Place-then-Move  meta-rule.

5  Final  Iteration 

Our  ﬁnal  version of  this game is played  on a 9 by  9 board, with  the Goal  tile at the center surrounded by  Draw 

1,  Place  1,  Move  1,  and  Token  Limit  6.  These  four  rules  are  not  reset  by  Rules  Reset. 

The  deck  composition  is  as  follows: 

•	 Rules (1  each): Token Limit 1  - 6;  Hand Limit 0  - 3;  Draw 2  - 4;  Move 2  - 4;  Place 2  - 4;  Place All;  None 
Shall  Pass;  Reverse  Play  Order;  No  Hand  Bonus;  No  Token  Bonus;  First  Play  Random;  Double  Agenda; 
X  =  X  +  1;  Borders  Bonus;  Jump 

•	 6  of  Place  A  Token,  Destroy  This  Token 

•	 4  of  Use  What  You  Take,  Desertion,  Mitosis,  Aversion,  Mind  Control,  Cut  the  Brakes 

•	 3  of  Draw  2  and  Place  Them,  Taxation,  Everybody  Gets  1,  Discard  and  Draw,  Draw  3  Place  2,  Remove 
A  Token 

•	 2  of  Teleport,  Reset  Rules,  Scramble  Keepers,  Trade  hands,  Go  Fish,  Trash  A  Keeper,  Obliterate  A 
Keeper,  Let’s  Do  That  Again,  Remove  A  Square,  Rotate  hands,  Let’s  Simplify,  Take  Another  Turn, 

Exchange  Keepers,  Trash  A  Rule,  Empty  the  Trash,  No  Limits,  I  Need  A  Goal,  Move  1  More,  Move  3 
More 

•	 1  of  Trash  All  Keepers,  Blight 

•	 Keepers (1  each): The Net, The Surfboard, Sleep, R R, The Book, The Sun, The Mind, The Hand, Time, 
Games,  The  Tool,  The  Top,  The  Table,  The  Hat,  The  Trick 

•	 Goals  (1  each):  Information  Superhighway,  Catch  Some  Z’s,  Barrel  Roll,  Summer  Vacation,  Ride  the 
Waves,  Time  Paradox,  Procrastination,  Mens  Et  Manus,  Board  Games,  MIT,  Mind  Games,  Handbook, 

Daydreaming,  Punt,  Tooltime,  Engineering,  Dungeons  &  Dragons,  Bowler,  La  Grange,  Thinking  Cap, 
Hat  Trick,  Hack,  Itinerary,  Prestidigitation,  Bridge 

In  playtesting,  we  found  that  the  deck  still  seemed  to  be  short  on  Keepers.  However,  the  ﬁghting  between 

players and  ﬁnding  clever ways to use Actions was fun.  It  would be diﬃcult to add  more Keepers (and  therefore 
more Goals), without making  the deck  more unwieldy  than it  already is.  We therefore feel  this game is  ﬁnished; 

it  successfully  incorporates  board  game  mechanics  into  Fluxx  while  preserving  its  thematic  rule  ﬂuctuations.
