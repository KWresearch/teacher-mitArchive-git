DrawBridge 
 
 
My card game is based largely upon the game of Bid-Whist.  Bid-Whist is a 
variant of Whist that is extremely similar to the Bridge game taught by Philip in lab.  One 
important difference is that in Bid Whist there is a kitty.  The kitty is a collection of cards 
purposely not dealt to the players’ hands which the declarer can take to replace some of 
the cards in his/her hand after winning the bid.  This element both adds an element of 
uncertainty and increases the advantage for the team that wins the contract.  This results 
in higher bidding than in Bridge which can result in more excitement during particularly 
risky bids.  I decided to keep this element and expand upon it.   An element I did not 
include was the choice between “uptown” and “downtown,” a choice that affects how the 
cards are ranked.  I did not include this element because it would have greatly reduced 
the attachment to cards that are used in bidding, since the higher cards would only be 
useful half of the time.  Since Bid-Whist and Bridge still share a large amount of 
common themes and most of the class is unfamiliar with Bid-Whist, I’ve decided to call it 
DrawBridge to better convey the basic playing style to beginning players. 
 
Just as in Bridge, a large portion of the bidding involves communication of 
information between partners.  Normally in Bridge, only the teams with better hands get a 
chance to pass information since the other team would be set if they bid.  However, in my 
variant there is an incentive to keep bidding at a low level, since that enables you to 
replace more of the cards in your hand.  The more cards you replace, the more voids you 
can give yourself to allow easy trumping.  If you take into account benefits of taking in 
and discarding cards while bidding in addition to the last two cards in the kitty it becomes 
much easier to bid competitively even with a worse hand. 
 
The main inspiration for my changes to the bidding process was trying to 
incorporate some of the primary elements of rummy into the game.  After the initial bids, 
you usually have a pretty good idea of what suits you and your partner are going for and 
which suits your opponents are going for.  Instead of trying to collect sets and sequences, 
players try to collect cards of the same suit and high cards.  Just as in rummy, one 
strategy could be to purposely take a card you feel your opponents would want just to 
deny them the card.  Note that I did find another game that uses the cards in your hand for 
bidding.  This game, called 99, uses the different suits in your hand to indicate how much 
you bid (The Ten Best …).  I feel that my bidding system is sufficiently distinct from it, 
since mine has a form of negative feedback for bidding regardless of which suit you bid. 
From playtesting, I found that often one suit would often become completely 
neglected and would end up being used primarily for bidding.  Since players are unsure 
who is going to win the contract players may not want to void themselves in their 
opponents suit or their partner’s suit or else they may regret it if they do not win the 
contract.  Sometimes when players ended up discarding all of the cards in their 
opponents’ suit they would be forced to drive up the bid even more knowing that they 
would be powerless to stop their opponents from cross-trumping.  In order to avoid this 
issue, I found a good strategy to be to discard the opponents’ suit only after picking up 
the kitty.   
 
My initial intent for this game was to make a variant where each bid would 
require a player to place a card, with higher cards representing higher bids.  The idea was 
to implement a form of negative feedback for players bidding high by forcing them to 

Sharat Bhat

give up their higher cards.  Negative feedback would be useful here since it’s in the 
beginning of the game, and it makes players able to start the game at about the same 
footing (Salen & Zimmerman).  However, this also causes some positive feedback since 
players with higher cards can more easily bid to higher levels.  For this reason, I added 
the constraint that cards must also be attached to the level, but bidding at a higher level 
requires higher cards.  This way both teams get the advantage of throwing their low cards 
in the beginning and driving the bid up would remove this advantage from both teams 
and require the team that did so to go to a high level.  This effect balances the beginning 
state of each hand. 
 
In order to make the game still flow, each team needs an incentive to win the bid.  
As a result, I allowed the declarer to essentially get an extra two free draws from the top 
of the draw stacks.  This is a form of positive feedback that encourages people to play 
more risky games.  Positive feedback is useful here because it causes a stronger 
differentiation between the declarer and the opposing team (Salen & Zimmerman).  The 
game becomes more interesting because the higher bids result in more risk, but are not 
completely chance-based due to the fact that the “kitty” is known beforehand.  I feel this 
is a compromise between increased strategic level and the feeling of uncertainty akin to 
that of a high-stakes bluff in poker. 
As I worked on the game, it evolved in many different ways.  In the initial version 
the bidding worked slightly differently with each player allowed to play any card higher 
than the previous card and bid any level that is greater than the previous bid.  I also had a 
special rule where you could bid the same level as the previous person only if you played 
the same bid card as the previous person.  I realized that the flaw in this bidding is that if 
some team had the majority of the aces, they could “buy” the contract at a really low 
level.  To fix this problem, I then tried adding a requirement that the bid must be at least 
half the value of the bidding card used.  So if you play an eight you must bid at least 4 
and if you play an ace you must bid at least 7.  This forced players to play at a decent 
level before the contract could be “bought.”  However, in the end I decided that even then 
players were being too limited by the cards they were dealt.  I instead eliminated the 
double bidding system where both the card and the bid must be beaten each time.  I made 
the bidding closer to Bridge with only the bid mattering.  However, I required each bid to 
have a bid card placed as a “toll” for bidding.   
 
In my initial iteration, I had only nine cards dealt to each player and had more 
cards in the draw stacks.  However, I found that we rarely exhausted the supply of the 
draw stack.  Additionally, with so many cards out of play and unknown, there was a great 
amount of uncertainty in the game.  Since this game is based of Bridge and Bid-Whist, 
strategy is an important element of the game.  With so much information hidden from the 
players, it becomes very hard to predict the optimal play.  For instance, if multiple high 
trumps are missing in the remainder of the draw stack the declarer may try to flush them 
out only to find that he/she is wasting all the trumps for nothing.  To restore the strategic 
element to the game, I changed it so ten cards are dealt to each player.  I found that in this 
case the bidding usually resulted in only three or four cards being obscured from all the 
players. 
 
When I begin with this game idea, I had only planned to find a way to combine 
elements of rummy with elements of trick-taking games.  However, as the game evolved 
I was better able to identify the key points that made this game unique and interesting.  

Sharat Bhat

The bidding draws upon players experience from rummy-type games to add a new 
element to trick-taking games.  The ability to change your hand gives players more 
control over how strong their hand is and leaves less up to chance than the opening deal 
in Bridge.  Leaving some cards unknown to all the players can add some more 
uncertainty to the game, but adding too much uncertainty can diminish the strategic 
elements of the game.  Through these elements I feel that I have successfully created a 
unique experience.

Appendix 
DrawBridge Rules: 
 
Players:  4 players only 
 
Deck:   1 standard international 52 card deck 
 
Setup:  
Each player is dealt out 10 cards.  The remaining 12 cards are split into 
two draw stacks of 6 with the top card in each stack face up. 

 
Goal:   
Players are split into two teams with partners sitting across from each 
other.  Players can decide ahead of time to either play a set number of hands or 
until a designated point total is reached.  The team with the highest score wins 
once the designated ending point has been reached. 

 
Bidding: 
Players take turns bidding clockwise starting with the left of the dealer 
(the deal should be rotated between each hand as well).  A bid consists of 
choosing a trump suit (or no trump if you want to play without a trump suit) and 
the minimum number of tricks you think that you and your partner can make out 
of the maximum possible number of ten.  A player bids by dropping a card from 
their hand onto the bidding stack and picking up one of the face-up cards at the 
top of the two stacks.  After a card is taken from a draw stack the next card in that 
stack is flipped over.  Note that if a single draw stack is emptied players will only 
have one choice from the draw pile when they bid.  Cards on the bidding stack are 
out of play for the rest of the hand; they cannot be picked up again by anyone.  
The rule is that you must place a card valued at least 3 higher than the number of 
tricks you are bidding.  So if you make a bid of 3 spades, the card played must be 
at least a 6 or higher.  Additionally, each bid must be at a level greater than or 
equal to the number of tricks needed in the previous bid, where it can only be 
equal if the card placed down is higher than the previous card placed.  Suit does 
not have any effect on how high a bid is.  So a bid of 3 spades with a 7 of hearts 
played can be beaten by any bid of 4-level or any bid of 3-level which has a card 
ranked 7 or higher placed down.  Each player also has the option to pass which 
means that they don’t get to pick up a card for that round.  If a player passes they 
still have the option to bid in the next round if someone changes the bid after they 
passed.  Bidding ends when 3 players pass in a row or if both draw stacks are 
emptied.   

 
Play: 

 
The player who wins the contract is referred to as the declarer.  After the 
declarer wins the contract they get a chance to take the two face-up cards and 
discard whichever two cards they want from their hand.  If one or more of the 
draw stacks has been emptied, the declarer may only take the face-up card from 
the remaining stack, not two cards.  Note that the declarer has the option to 
discard the same card he/she picked up.  After the declarer discards, all the 
players have one final chance to reexamine the bidding cards and the cards 
discarded by the declarer.  Once everyone has finished, the player to the left of the 

Sharat Bhat 
CMS.608 
declarer leads a card.  Play proceeds in the same manner as Whist/Bridge with 
each player required to follow suit and every trump being higher than all non-
trumps (trump being the suit chosen by the declarer during bidding).   

 
Scoring: 
If the team makes the contract (gets as many tricks as they bid), they get 
double however much they bid and 1 point for every overtrick.  If the team fails to 
make the contract, their opponents instead get 4 points for every trick they set 
them by.  For example, if one team bids 7 and makes only 5 tricks, the opponents 
get 4*2 = 8 points.  If they had instead made 8 tricks, they would have gotten 
7*2+1 = 15 points.
