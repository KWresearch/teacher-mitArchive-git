Continental checkers is a variant of the checkers family of games.  This variety of 
checkers was popular in France sometime between the ﬁfteenth and eighteenth centu-
ries.  In this paper I will review the rules of continental checkers, describe the results of 
playtesting this game, and discuss the effects of some rule modiﬁcations on the stan-
dard gameplay experience. 
Original Rules 
•  The materials required are a playing board, and forty playing pieces.  Twenty of 
the playing pieces should be of a single color, and the remaining twenty pieces of a 
single other color easily distinguishable from the ﬁrst.  Pieces can be represented by 
coins or any object serving as a placeholder in a single square of the playing board. 
•	 The playing board is composed of one hundred spaces, ﬁfty spaces each of two 
different colors.  The spaces are of square shape and are arranged to form a 

A ten space by ten space, one hundred square playing board.

square playing board of ten space by ten space dimensions.  The squares of the 
board are arranged such that in any row or column adjacent squares alternate 
color, and any diagonal of squares within the board contains only squares of one 
color. 
•	 There are two kinds of pieces, the standard (“soldier”) piece and the promoted 
(“king”) piece.  At the start of the game all pieces for both players are standard 
pieces. 
•	 Each player begins the game with twenty pieces.  An individual playerʼs pieces 
should all be of the same color, and of a different color than the pieces of the op-
ponent. 
•	 To begin the game, each playerʼs pieces are placed on the black squares at his 
respective end of the board. The back four rows of each playerʼs respective side

are ﬁlled by standard playing pieces in the starting position.

•	 Pieces may be moved along the black diagonals, in either the forward or back-
ward direction.  Pieces may move only one space per turn unless capturing. 
•	 Capture is forced.  If a player has an opportunity to capture (“jump”) one of the 
opponentʼs pieces, the player must do so.  If the player has more than one piece 
capable of capturing enemy pieces, the player must move the piece which cap-
tures the greatest number of the opponentʼs pieces. 
•	 A standard piece may capture an opposing piece located diagonally adjacent to it 
if there is an open space immediately beyond the opposing piece. 
•	 A promoted piece may capture an opposing piece at any point along the diagonal 
if there are no other pieces between the promoted piece and the opposing piece 
to be captured, and there is an open square in at least the spot immediately be-

yond opposing piece.  If there are multiple open spaces beyond the opposing 
piece the move of the promoted piece may end its move in any open space be-
yond the opposing piece. 
•	 A piece may be promoted if its move ends on a square located in the opponentʼs 
back row.  A piece would not be promoted if during its move it travels through the 
back row but continues moving and ﬁnally settles on a space in a row other than 
the back row. 
Pre-Play Analysis and Comparison 
The most easily noticeable difference between Continental Checkers and the 
commonly played checkers (known as English draughts or American checkers) is

would not change gameplay of American checkers other than spreading out the 
pieces and possibly incorporating a few more pieces for each player.  
Gameplay in Continental checkers is affected by three key differences from 
American checkers:  The ability of pieces to move both forward and backward, 
forced capture, and method of capture by promoted pieces.  Before playing, the 
method of capture deﬁned for promoted pieces seems similar to the method of 
movement deﬁned for the queen piece in the game of Chess.  This type of move-
ment is very unique compared to my previous experience in playing American 
checkers and may prove to be an interesting difference in the gameplay experience. 
Playtesting 
In playtesting I ﬁrst played the game a small number of times under the original 
rules.  Gameplay was especially slow in the beginning as both players attempted to be 
very mindful of the the rules, and spent an extra thirty seconds to a minute reviewing 
each move to ensure that no forced capture opportunities were missed.  Play by both 
participants was very defensive, which may have been a result of the lack of familiarity 
with the rules.  It is unlikely that the defensive style of play demonstrated by the partici-
pants was due to the ability of pieces to move backward as well as forward as both 
players continually forgot that they were allowed to move pieces in this manner. 
After a few games both players began to utilize the backward movement more fre-
quently and in doing so were able to better prevent the loss of pieces in later turns. 
Players became better at avoiding losses, but remained very slow to develop an attack. 
Multiple piece captures almost never occurred excepting a few cases where a player 
mistakenly left themselves exposed.

As play continued, players eventually began to utilize strategy in which they would 
sacriﬁce a piece hoping to realize a larger gain (capturing one or more of the opponents 
pieces) in a future turn as follows: 
First player moves a piece into a position where it will be captured. 
1.	
Second player, by the rules, must capture it. Second player is now in an unfa-
2.	
vorable position. 
First player now uses this turn to capture more pieces than were originally 
sacriﬁced.

Here an arrow highlights the chosen end location of
the promoted white piece.  The red piece has been
captured and the white piece has avoided capture by
selecting the furthest open space beyond the now
captured red piece. 

Rule Changes 

In an attempt to increase attacking movements a rule was introduced that allowed 
the player occupying a speciﬁc predetermined space on the board to move two pieces 

Continental CheckersCampoverde

each turn rather than just one.  This rule change was immediately strange to play with 
because there is no “center space” on the game board that each player from the starting 
position is equally likely to occupy.  Introducing a second symmetrically placed spot that 
would allow a second move tended to just negate the advantageous effect of being able 
to move twice, because the opponent was also able to move twice.  This simply led to 
the game being played in turns of two moves per player, which did not alter the game 
signiﬁcantly enough for the players to continue with this “king of the hill” rule. 
An interesting aspect of the game was the strategy involved in moving and capturing 
with promoted pieces.  In the ﬁrst games we played few pieces were ever promoted. 

Strategic maneuvers with promoted pieces.  On the left: By chaining captures and selecting appropriate
landing spaces for each capture the promoted red piece is able to traverse a signiﬁcant portion of the board,
and capture four white pieces.  On the right:  A few turns later the other promoted piece on the red side is 
also able to chain captures, resulting in a red victory. 
The promoted pieces introduced a very interested new strategic element that we at-
tempted to enhance.  In order to bring about more promoted pieces we changed the 
promotion rule so that any piece that ended a turn on a space in the opponentʼs back

two rows would be promoted, rather than just the back row.  This rule change did in fact 
increase forward and attacking activity, as both players attempted to gain an advantage 
by increasing their number of promoted pieces as quickly as possible. 
In general the frequency with which pieces were promoted did increase, but this was 
not always the case as the players would at times would simply avoid moving the pieces 
from their back two rows in order to prevent the opponent from promoting pieces.  This 
defensive strategy created an interesting method in which players would seem to attack 
in waves, ﬁrst with their forward pieces, and eventually when necessary with a second 
wave of the pieces from their back rows. 
If one player was able to gain a number of promoted pieces early, it did provide a 
noticeable attacking advantage for that player and would create and inequality in 
strength that could be very challenging for the second player to recover from.  This ine-
quality did arise occasionally, but was enjoyed by the players. 
Rule Ambiguities 
The rule sources utilized lacked information regarding a few scenarios we encoun-
tered during play testing.  We decided to resolve them as follows: 
• A promoted piece can move one space when not capturing. 
• A promoted piece can make multiple captures in a single turn. 
• A captured piece is considered removed from the board as soon as the piece cap-
turing it passes over it.  This allows promoted pieces to move back and forth along 
a diagonal to make multiple captures if possible.

Continental checkers seems to be a more challenging strategic game than American 
checkers.  Over more time and more intense play very high level strategies could de-
velop to take advantage of forced capture and promoted piece movement.  These 
strategies stem largely from design decisions implemented in the rules of the game, and 
allow movement capabilities to the players that allow for this to be an entertaining and 
stimulating game in its own right. 
Contributions 
I have provided an explanation of the rules for this variant of checkers, and included 
graphics I have created to help clarify rules that may be misinterpreted. I highlighted a 
few differences between this version of checkers and American checkers, as well as 
describing interesting events in playtesting.  Interesting movements or strategy from 
playtesting have been included in the form of diagrams to help share the gameplay ex-
perience with the reader.  Some of the gameʼs rules were modiﬁed in attempts to en-
hance certain aspects of the game.  Though not all of the modiﬁcations were successful 
it appears that a good middle ground could be reached between the original rules and 
modiﬁed rules to increase the attacking aspect of the game, and it would be very inter-
ested in playing either the original or modiﬁed version of this game again in the future.
