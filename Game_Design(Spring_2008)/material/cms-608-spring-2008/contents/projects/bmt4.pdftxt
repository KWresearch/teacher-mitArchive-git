Overview 

Our  aesthetic  goals  in  creating  our  game  were  discovery  and  personal  expression.  We  wanted  to  design  a  game 

that  supported  the  exploration  of  uncharted  territory,  and  also  rewarded  creativity.  The  goal  of  the  player  in 
our game is to  collect letters  and  spell  words in  categories selected by  other players.  We designed  several  of  the 

mechanics  that  allow  the  player  to  achieve  his  goals  to  support  our  aesthetic  goals.  For  example,  we  designed 
the  mechanic  of  having  moving  through  the  board  to  support  exploration.  At  the  start,  almost  all  of  the  tiles 

are unexposed  to the players, and  they  must  move through  these tiles to have them be  ﬂipped  over and  revealed. 
We also dont allow any player to move within  a space of  another player, which  encourages exploration by giving 

a  player  ﬁrst  access  to  any  tiles  he  discovers. 

An  example  of  a  mechanic  designed  to  support  personal  expression  is  the  vague  restrictions  on  categories  and 
on  words  that  satisfy  these  categories.  Since players  can  spell  virtually  anything (7 letters  or less),  we hoped 

that being  creative with  words that  ﬁt  a given category  would be socially  rewarding, with players acknowledging 

and  laughing  at  clever  responses. 

Of  the  four  types  of  players  described  in  “Hearts,  Clubs,  Diamonds,  and  Spades:  Players  who  Suit  MUDs,” 
we  strove  for  a  game  that  was  meant  mostly  for  the  explorer  and  the  socialiser1 .  The  explorer  is  supported 
because he  can  explore the physical  space  of  the game (the tiles),  and later  can  explore the depth  of  the game, 
by  creatively  testing  the  bounds  of  what  words  other  players  will  accept  for  diﬀerent  categories.  The  socialiser 

is  supported  because  our game involves  a  lot  of player-player interaction.  Players decide  on  categories for  others 
to try  to  spell  words in,  and  even decide if  another players  words are  acceptable for  a given  category.  The  close 

physical  relation  of  all players  of  our game  and  some downtime (due  to  other players  thinking)  also  allow for 
social  interaction  between  players. 

In fact, if players try  to  compete  competitively (as  an  achiever  or  an imposer  might),  our game becomes  much 

less  fun.  Just  as  described  by  Stephen  Balzac  when  playing  a  LARP,  the  players  main  goal  should  be  to 
enjoy  themselves  and  have  fun  through  exploration  and  creativity,  not  to  win  in  the  competitive  sense2 .  When 
iterating  through  our design through play  testing,  we kept  this goal in  mind.  To discourage players from just 
trying  to beat  other players, we didnt provide many forms of  conﬂict in our game.  In Rules of Play, Katie Salen 
and  Eric  Zimmerman  would  describe  the  conﬂict  in  our  game  as  indirect  conﬂict3 .  For  the  most  part,  players 
cant  interfere  with  each  others  success.  This  was  a  desired  dynamic  of  our  game,  since  it  doesnt  allow  players 

to  impede  each  other  from  discovery  and  expression.

Iteration  1 

Rules 

Overview 

The  purpose  of  this  game  is  to  explore  a  space  of  letters  on  a  game  board,  and  collect  letters  to  spell  words.  A 

category  of  word  must  be  agreed  upon  for  the  ﬁrst  round  at  the  start  at  the  game,  and  then  each  successive 
category is  chosen by  the  winner  of  the previous  round.  A  round lasts  until  a player  successfully  spells  a  word in 

the  designated  category.  An  entire  game  consists  of  several  consecutive  rounds.  The  number  of  rounds  played 
is decided before the game starts (e.g.  ﬁrst to 3, ﬁrst to 5). 

Start 

The  board  is  a  14  ×  13  grid  covered  by  182  face-down  letter  tiles.  Each  player  starts  at  a  designated  start 
location  on  the  board,  and  collects  the  piece  at  that  location,  ﬂipping  over  the  four  pieces  in  contact  with  the 
start location.  Roll dice to see who goes  ﬁrst, and proceed in a clockwise fashion starting  with  the payer whose 

roll  is  highest. 

Taking  a  Turn 

A player can  make one  move per turn.  A player can  move to  any location on the board (including  spaces  where 

letters  are  still face-down),  except to  any  of  the four  spaces  surrounding  any  of  the  other players.  If  that  space 
still has  a letter in it, then the player MUST  collect that letter.  If  the letter  was face-down, the player need  not 

reveal  what  letter  he  or  she  picked  up.  Blank  tiles  can  be  used  for  any  letter. 

If  collecting  this letter puts  the player  over his  maximum  number  of letters (7),  then  the player  must discard 
one  letter.  When  a  letter  is  discarded,  it  is  removed  from  the  game  permanently.  The  identity  of  discarded 

letter  need  not be  revealed  to  other players.  If  any  of  the four  spaces  surrounding  the player’s  new location  are 

still face down,  ﬂip  them to face up (see Figure).

End  of  Round 

A  round  ends  when  any player  successfully  spells  a  word in  the  current  category.  When  this  happens,  the player 
that  succeeds  discards  all  his  letters  used  in  spelling  the  word,  but  all  other  letters  are  kept  for  the  next  round. 

A  new  category  is  selected,  and  play  continues  where  it  left  oﬀ. 

Analysis 

After our  ﬁrst iteration, we quickly  discovered  a UI problem with  our game.  Since the tiles were made of paper 

and placed  closely  together, they  were diﬃcult to pick  up.  This discouraged players from exploring  the physical 
depth  of  the  game,  they  were  reluctant  to  move  to  new  places  because  they  would  have  to  deal  with  ﬂipping 

over  pieces.  We  also  discovered  the  undesired  dynamic  of  players  creating  the  shortest,  ﬁrst  word  they  could. 
This  went against our goal  of  allowing  the players to be  creative, because the  category  would be  changed before 

a  player  got  the  chance  to  spell  a  long,  creative  word.  This  essentially  added  a  form  of  conﬂict  to  the  game, 
that  of  trying  to spell  a short  word  and  win the round,  rendering  the tiles other players had gathered for a word 

in  that  category  less  useful  to  them.  We  decided  to  address  the  UI  issue  in  our  next  iteration  of  the  game. 

Iteration  2 

Ob jective 

The goal for  the  second iteration  of the game  was  to  solve the UI issues  we  encountered in  our initial playthrough. 
We  also  wanted  to begin  exploring  mechanics that  would  encourage players to play  longer  words. 

Gameplay  Changes 

The game  was played  with  a  set  of 100 Scrabble tiles,  on  a 10  × 10 grid.  At the  end  of  a  round, the player  with 
the winning  word gets a number of points corresponding  to the value of their word in Scrabble (i.e.  the sum 

of  the  values  indicated  on  their  tiles).  The  game  ends  when  all  players  agree  that  they  cannot  play  a  word  in 
the  current  category  using  the  letter  they  have  collected  and  those  remaining  on  the  board.  The  winner  is  the 

person  with  the  most  points. 

Analysis 

The  change  from  small  paper  tiles  to  the  physical  Scrabble  tiles  improved  the  UI  issues  encountered  during 

the  initial  iteration.  However,  the  Scrabble  board  was  not  entirely  useful  for  the  new  iteration.  In  particular, 
it  became  diﬃcult  to  keep  track  of  the  grid  on  which  the  tiles  were  arranged,  since  the  Scrabble  grid  was  too 

closely  spaced,  and  would  lead  to  the  same  UI  issue  as  the  previous  design,  with  slightly  larger  tiles.  So,  the 

change  was  very  much  a  positive,  in  that  it  improved  the  UI,  but  it  didnt  resolve  the  interface  issues  entirely. 

The  addition  of  the  scoring  mechanic  also  helped  to  address  the  issue  with  using  short  words.  In  particular, 

the point  values Scrabble assigned  to the tiles encouraged players to think  of  words containing  rarer letters, like 

Z  and  Q.  However,  the  scoring  aspect  added  a  further  potential  incentive  for  conﬂict,  since  there  was  a  drive 

3 

to  score  the  largest  number  of  points.  In  addition,  there  still  was  a  strong  drive  to  simply  place  the  ﬁrst  word 

possible,  since there  was  no penalty  for placing  shorter  words,  or for the  number  of  words played.  Single-letter 
words  were  still  played,  which  would  grant  very  few  points  but  confer  the  larger  beneﬁt  of  selecting  a  category 

that  favored  one’s  remaining  tiles. 

Iteration  3 

Ob jective 

This  iteration,  we  sought  to  devise  a  mechanic  that  encouraged bigger plays  not  by  rewarding longer  words, but 
making  it  easier  for  players  to  punish  shorter  ones. 

Gameplay  Changes 

When  a  player  put  a  word  into  play,  any  of  the  other  players  could  challenge  it.  The  challenging  player  made 
a  bet  of  size  k ,  so  that  k  additional  turns  are  played,  excluding  players  that  have  already  submitted  words.  At 
the  end  of  these  turns,  the  challenging  player  must  play  a  word  at  least  k  letters  longer  than  the  challenged 
word, or else the  challenge fails.  If  a challenge fails, the  challenging player discards all  of his tiles.  If  a challenge 

succeeds,  the  person  whose  play  was  challenge  simply  loses  the  tiles  in  his  played  word. 

We  simultaneously  removed  the  Scrabble-style  scoring  of  words,  and  returned  to  declaring  the  winner  to  be  the 
player  who  successfully  submitted  words  for  the  most  categories. 

Analysis 

The  mechanic  was  eﬀective  in  increasing  the  length  of  words  being  played.  Players  waited  for  ﬁve-letter  words 
during  early  stages  of  the  game.  This  change  also  introduced  drama  into  the  game,  creating  tension  when  a 

challenge  depended  on  acquiring  a  letter  that  wasnt  revealed  on  the  board.  The  main  issue  with  this  iteration 
was  that  frequent  challenging  tended  to  strip  the  board  of  useful  letters,  i.e.  vowels,  Ss,  and  Ts,  so  that  ﬁnding 

words using  the depleted  set  of  tiles became diﬃcult.  The possibility  of losing  many  tiles  at the time  also made 
players  more hesitant  to  submit  words,  which  slowed  the game down  and  also  exacerbated letter  depletion  when 

players  discarded  to  ﬁnd  that  perfect  six  or  seven  letter  word. 

Final  Iteration 

Ob jective 

For  this  iteration,  we  made  a  minor  adjustment  to  challenge  rules  to  make  losing  challenges  less  painful.  We 
also  changed  a  few  potential  ambiguities  in  the  rules. 

4 

Gameplay  Changes 

Upon losing  a  challenge, discard half  of your tiles (rounded  up)  if you  are the  challenger,  or discard half  of  the 
tiles (rounded  up)  in your  submitted  word if you  are  challenged (and keep  the  rest). 

Challenges must be made  “in sequence,”  so that when a word is played, the player to that person’s left gets the 

ﬁrst  chance  to  challenge,  or  may  pass  it  up  to  the  next  person,  and  so  forth. 

During  the  course of  a turn,  one  should  move, draw a tile, play  a  word if desired,  and  then discard.  This  means 
that it is possible to play  eight-letter  words.  It  also prevents the loss  of  a tile if  one has  seven tiles, draws,  and 

then  plays  a  word. 

Analysis 

This  tweak  removed  the  hesitation  players  showed  last  iteration.  Players  were  both  more  willing  to  put  forth 

words,  as  well  as  more  willing  to  challenge  other  players.  The  game  has  now  switched  from  our  original  goal 
of  an  exploratory,  social  game  to  one  more  competitive  in  nature.  Still,  the  mechanics  that  incorporate  player 

conﬂict  actually  contribute to the game’s  social playability, since they  regulate word length  and prevent players 
from  overusing  simple  three-letter  words.

Final  Rules 

Setup 

Place  all  100 Scrabble  tiles  face down  on  the  board  in  a  10  × 10 grid.  Each player places his  token  on  one  of  the 
designated  starting  locations,  and  takes  the  tile  from  that  space.  The  four  adjacent  tiles  are  ﬂipped  to  reveal 

their letters.  Players then roll  a die to determine who goes  ﬁrst.  The player with  the highest roll goes  ﬁrst, and 
play  continues  clockwise.  The  ﬁrst  player  also  determines  the  initial  word  category. 

Word  Categories 

There  are  no  restrictions  on  the  categories  which  may  be  used  as  word  restrictions.  A  few  suggestions  for 
ideas  for  the  stuck  include  animals,  insects,  brands,  or  winter.  The  determination  of  whether  a  word  ﬁts  into  a 

category  is  left  to  the  discretion  of  the  players. 

Normal  Play 

On  a  players  turn,  they  may  move  to  any  square  on  the  board  with  a  letter  tile  so  long  as  it  is  not  adjacent  to 

another  player.  When  a  player  moves  to  a  square,  they  must  collect  the  tile  there,  and  ﬂip  any  tiles  which  are 
face  down  in  the  4  adjacent  squares.  If,  at  the  end  of  his  turn,  the  player  has  more  than  7  tiles,  he  must  choose 

1  to  discard.  Discarded  tiles  are  placed  face  down  out  of  the  game. 

Playing  Words 

If,  after  moving,  a  player  can  play  a  complete  word  which  matches  the  current  category,  he  may  do  so.  When 

a  word  is  put  into  play,  other  players  may  challenge  the  player.  In  a  challenge,  the  player  states  that  they  can 
create  a  longer  word  in  a  set  number  of  turns.  The  word  they  create  must  be  at  least  as  many  letters  longer 

than the  current  word  as the  number  of  turns  requested.  As  an  example, if  a player plays  a 3 letter  word,  and 
his  opponent  asks  for  1  turn  to  challenge  it,  they  must  play  a  word  at  least  4  letters  long  on  the  next  turn. 

If  the  challenger is  unsuccessful,  they  must discard half  of their  tiles (rounded  up).  If  they  are  successful,  the 
other players are allowed  a chance to challenge, otherwise the new word  wins the  round, and  they  are allowed  to 

select  the  new  category.  Players  whose  words  are  successfully  challenged  must  discard  half  of  the  tiles  in  their 

submitted  words (rounded  up),  and  may  keep  the  rest. 

End  Game 

The  game  ends  when  there  are  no  longer  enough  remaining  tiles  for  anyone  to  create  a  word  in  the  current 

category.  The  winner  is  the  player  that  has  completed  the  most  categories.
