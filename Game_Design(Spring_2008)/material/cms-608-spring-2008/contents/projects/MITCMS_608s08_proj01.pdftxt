First Essay: Research a Historical Game 

 

Find a game that is at least 100 years old. Analyze it by applying the topics and methods that 
we have discussed in class. Play the game with friends or classmates and make any changes 
to make it playable today, if necessary. Document any changes that you made to the game, 
and of course playtest them. 

In the paper, you should analyze the game and address your playtest processâ€”what problems 
you came across and how you tried to solve them; what the outcomes of your playtesting 
were; how changes in the rules generated different dynamics and if these created a different 
experience. Make references to the class readings and use the terminology and techniques 
introduced in class. 

In your paper, do not forget to include the original game rules, the outcomes of your testing, 
and any amendments you made. Diagrams are encouraged. 1000-1500 words. Due in Lec #7.
