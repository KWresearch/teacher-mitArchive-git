Second Team Project: Design an Original Game 

In teams of 3 or 4 students, design a game to meet the following constraints: 

• 

• 

• 
• 

• 

Use every tool and process introduced this semester to come up with an original 
game!  
State an aesthetic goal in the first week and attempt to design for it. (The game can 
evolve towards other aesthetics through testing and iteration.)  
The game must be playable in a small room, like a regular classroom.  
New players must be able to understand the game and complete a full game in a total 
of 30 minutes.  
Your game must be playable by three or four player groups. State any rule changes 
necessary for 3-player or 4-player groups.  

Your submission should include your game rules (separate from your essay), a list of token, 
card, or dice requirements (if any), game board (if any), and any custom items and cards 
submitted in hardcopy and PDF format. Due in Lec #38. 

Your submission should include a single team-written paper between 1500 and 3000 words. 
Applying the topics and methods that we have discussed in class, playtest the game 
extensively and document any changes that you made to the game. Analyze the game and 
address your playtest process—what problems you came across and how you tried to solve 
them; what the outcomes of your playtesting were; how changes in the rules generated 
different dynamics and if these created a different experience. 

Remember! Make references to relevant class readings and use the terminology and 
techniques introduced in class. 

In your paper, do not forget to include the different versions of your game rules, the outcomes 
of your testing, and any amendments you made. Diagrams are required. 

Components 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

The game can be a board game, a card game, a live-action game, or it could just 
require players, tables, chairs, and rules.  
If you create or use custom components, they must be submitted with your 
assignment, and they will not be returned.  
You may require the players to supply up to five six-sided dice and to provide up to six 
different colors of generic, identically-shaped tokens in any quantity. (We will test your 
game by having six different colors of beads on hand.)  
If your game requires play money, recommend the quantity of denominations of the 
currency for an ideal number of players.  
You must provide any other kinds of randomizing devices, game items, or tokens.  

Deadlines 

• 
• 

Send the instructors your intended aesthetic by Lec #34.  
Be prepared to blind-test your game during the final workshop. You must have your 
rules written in a form that would be understandable to a completely new player. Have all 
your rules and all game components before we start the workshop session.  

The final paper is due in Lec #38, before we start the class. Submit it to us via email 
and bring a hard copy with all your game components so that the class can play the 
game during lecture.
