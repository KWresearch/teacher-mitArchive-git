Developing a Variant of Contract Bridge 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
 
Contact Bridge is a popular trick-taking card game that originated from the British game Whist. The first 
published rulebook for the game, titled Biritch, or Russian Whist, was printed in 1886 in London; this 
version of whist included auctioning and the use of trumps. The modern version of bridge was developed by 
Harold Stirling Vanderbilt, who published a scoring system for contract bridge in 1925. The popularity of the 
game is in part due to its sociable nature; it is often played in teams of lovers and partners. Ely Culbertson 
dedicated his book Blue Book, a game about contract bridge, to “My wife and favorite partner” (Parlett, 
1991, p.26). 
 
 
In this paper, a variant of contract bridge will be studied. The development of this variant was explored 
through iterations of playtesting, and the results of these iteration will be analyzed. The aim of creating this 
variation was to design a version of bridge that allowed players to feel a greater sense of control over what 
cards they were dealt as well as allow players to exert some control over what cards were given to their 
opponents. The information and feedback systems of bridge were adjusted and explored to see whether these 
changes could help create a variant of bridge that was challenging and enjoyable. 
 
 
RULES OF THE GAME 
 
 
The variant created was based on the rules of contract bridge defined by the American Contract Bridge 
League (ABCL, 2005). Contract bridge scoring was not used for the variant because it added another level of 
complexity that was not necessary to observe the desired effects rule changes had on gameplay. A dummy 
was not used either because this variation allows all players to play and make decision in the game. Since the 
rules were changed over several iterations, the specific rule changes for each variant will be mentioned when 
each variant is discussed; the general rules of play are discussed below. 
 
 
Bridge is played with four players at a square table; the players sitting across from each other form a 
partnership so that there are two teams. Bridge is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. First, all four 
players draw cards to determine who will be the dealer. Aces are the highest value card, while twos are the 
lowest. The order of the value of the suits from high to low is spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs. The dealer 
than deals the cards face down one at a time to each player in clockwise order until all 52 cards are dealt. 
Each player should have 13 cards at this point. 
 
 
The players then take turns bidding. The dealer bids first by stating the number of tricks he believes he and 
his partner can take as well as the suit of the trump. The bidding then proceeds in a clockwise fashion; a 
player can outbid another by either a) bidding the same number of tricks but a higher suit for the trump, or b) 
bidding a higher number of tricks for any trump. The order of suits for the trumps from high to low is no 
trump, spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs. Bidding ends after three successive passes after a bid. The 
winning bidder and his partner must achieve the number of tricks stated in the bid to win the game. 
 
 
The winning bidder then places down a card of his choice, called the lead. The other players then place down 
a card of the same suit one at a time in clockwise order. If a player has a card of the lead card’s suit, it must 
be placed down; otherwise, the player can choose to discard any card from his hand or play a card of the 

trump suit. If a player has multiple cards of the same suit, he can choose which one to play. One wins the 
trick by placing the highest value card of the leading card’s suit or by placing the highest value trump card 
down. Once a trick is won, the four cards from that round of trick-taking are placed aside facedown. The 
player that wins the trick is the first to place down a card of his choice in the next round. This continues for 
thirteen rounds until all the cards are gone. If the winning bidder’s team reaches their contracted number of 
tricks, his team has won; otherwise, the other team has won. 
 
 
PLAYTESTING 
 
 
The following variants were playtested by two groups. The first group, Group A, was composed of four 
players that all had some experience playing bridge. The second group, Group B, was composed of four 
players that had no experience playing bridge. For the second group, several rounds of bridge were played 
with no trumps, bidding, or scoring, to familiarize the group with the basic rules of bridge. Afterwards, 
bidding was introduced, and finally, the variants were played. 
 
 
VARIANT I 
 
 
In the first variant, only eight cards were originally dealt to each player instead of 13. The remaining 20 cards 
were left in a stack face down at the center of the table. Normal bidding would proceed, and the first round of 
trick-taking would be played. The winner of the first trick would then look at the top card of the central stack 
without revealing this card to any of the other players. He has two choices; he can a) keep this card in his 
hand and then deal one card to each of the remaining three players in clockwise order, or b) pass this card 
along to the next player and then continue dealing one card to the remaining players so that he is the last one 
to receive a card. For example, the winner may pick up the first card from the stack and find a three of clubs. 
If clubs are not the trump, the card has little value, so the player will most likely pass this to the opponent on 
his left. Afterwards, he continues to deal one card each to his partner, his opponent on his right, and then 
finally to himself, hoping that the card he receives will be higher than a three. The game continues in this 
fashion where after each round of trick-taking, the winner looks at the first card in the stack and chooses to 
keep it or pass it. After the fifth round, when the last cards from the central stack are distributed, the game 
continues as a normal game of bridge. 
 
 
The purpose of this variant was to see how allowing players to exert some control over which cards they have 
or which cards their opponent have affected the gameplay. It was essentially an experiment on positive 
feedback; allowing the winner to look at the card in the center gives him an added advantage of either taking 
a high card for himself or giving a low card to his opponent. If he chooses to pass the card to his opponent, he 
not only has given his opponent a low card but he now also knows one card that his opponent certainly has. 
 
 
Variant I was playtested by both Group A and Group B five times cumulatively. With both groups, bids were 
much lower than in a normal game of bridge since players did not know all of the cards they would 
eventually have in their hand. Because bids were lower, contracts would be fulfilled or lost more quickly than 
normal. An important result of the game was that the winning team continued to win because of the positive 
feedback built into the variant. It made sense that the winning team kept winning because positive feedback 
“encourages the system to exhibit more and more extreme behavior” (Salen and Zimmerman, 2004, p. 215). 
In the case of this variant, the “extreme behavior” is that the winning team keeps winning. The advantage of 
the winning player was not fully predicted at construction of the variant. The winning player deals three 
cards of unknown value to three of the players, and as a result, he does not know whether he has dealt high 

cards or low cards to these players. However, testing found that allowing the player to look at just one card 
was enough to make the game unbalanced. 
 
 
Imperfect information, or information hidden from players during the game (Salen and Zimmerman, 2004, 
p.204), decreases with this variant since the players now have the opportunity to pass cards of known value 
(only to the winning player) to their opponent. However, at the onset of the game, the amount of information 
known to the players is not as much as in a normal game of bridge because not all cards are dealt. Objective 
information in the game is the value of the trump and the cards that are available in a standard 52-card deck. 
The perceived information is a players idea of each players hand, including which cards have been played 
and which cards his opponent is saving to use. The amount of perceived information is directly related to the 
amount of imperfect information; as the amount of imperfect information decreases, the accuracy of a 
player’s perceived information increases (if the player is skilled enough). The amount of imperfect 
information decreases with each round of trick-taking because the players have seen which cards have been 
played as well as whether or not a player is out of a certain suit. However, in this variant, the player also has 
to think about which cards may be in the central stack since not all the cards are dealt out. There is less 
certainty about whether or not a certain card is being held in an opponents’ hand or if it is still in the stack. 
This added uncertainty made the game more complex and made it harder for players to judge whether or not 
a card could still be in play. 
 
 
The variant is a complex, emergent system; although the deck of cards stays the same, the way the game 
plays out cannot be predicted. The randomness associated with the dealing of the cards and the different 
strategies employed by the players lead to highly coupled interactions; a players decision to play certain 
cards depends on what cards have been played as well as his perception of which cards are in his opponents 
hands. As the number of cards available decreases, his strategy changes so that the relationship between the 
system (the game) and the object (the strategy of the players) is constantly changing. It is also context-
dependent because the strategies of the opponents change from game to game, so a player’s choice of cards 
to play from his hands dependents on the context of the specific game he is playing. 
 
 
Adding positive feedback was detrimental to the gameplay because it did not allow for a fair game. To 
account for this, a new variant, Variant II was developed. 
 
 
VARIANT II 
 
 
Variant II has the same rules as Variant I except that the player does not decide whether or not to keep the 
card. Winners of a trick are forced to take the first card from the stack and then continue dealing one card to 
each of the remaining players in clockwise order. This continues until all cards are played. 
 
 
The objective of Variant II was to see whether the random dealing of cards throughout the game would make 
the game more exciting than dealing all cards at once in the beginning. It was expected that situations would 
arise where a losing player may be dealt a high card towards the end of the game that may help his team 
recover. 
 
 
Variant II was playtested with both groups for a total of six rounds. It was found that the addition of the stack 
played a much weaker role in this variant because it simply added a random element to the game. The 
identity of the dealt cards from the central stack were for the most unknown; a player could not tell whether a 
player was holding onto a certain card or whether the card was still in the central deck. The game ended with 

each team having about an equal number of tricks, which made sense because the game was mostly the same 
as regular contract bridge except that not all cards were dealt out initially and, consequently, bids were lower 
since players did not have 13 cards in their original hand. Players did not find this variant to be much more 
interesting than normal bridge partly because the game would end faster since bidding was lower. Again, this 
variant required players to think about what cards could be in the central stack, and players sometimes 
gambled on there being a card in the stack that ended up actually being in someone’s hand. For example, one 
player played a jack hoping that the queen was still in the stack, but the following player played the queen of 
the same suit, winning the trick. The random element of dealing cards throughout the game did make the 
game less predictable, but it in general did not make the game much more exciting for the players. 
 
 
Next, a variant was tested with negative feedback to see if it would produce a balanced game, meaning that at 
the end of the game, no team won by an overwhelming number of tricks. 
 
 
VARIANT III 
 
 
The third variant is exactly the same as Variant I except that the winning player does not look at the central 
stack. Instead, the player to his left, who is on the team that lost the previous trick, would look at the top card 
in the central stack. He would then decide to keep it or pass it onto the player on his left, and would deal out 
three more cards, one each to the remaining players. This would continue until all cards are played. 
 
 
The objective of this variant was determine whether negative feedback would even out the game and make it 
interesting enough to be a game the players would enjoy playing. 
 
 
This variant was playtested by both groups a total of ten times. It proved to be a well-balanced game, with 
the bidding team losing and winning about an equal number of times. Also, no team won by an 
overwhelming number of tricks. Negative feedback allowed the losing team to catch up by giving them the 
advantage of taking high cards or passing low cards to their opponents. According to cyberneticists J. De 
Rosnay, “In a negative loop every variation towards a plus triggers a correction towards the minus, and vice 
versa…the system oscillates around an ideal equilibrium” (Salen and Zimmerman, 2005, p.215). This was 
observed in the game, and negative feedback helped produce a fun variant of bridge. Again, the amount of 
perceived information in the game was affected by the amount of unknown cards in the stack, and bids 
tended to be lower. 
 
 
One negative effect of the game was that sometimes it was confusing to remember who would lead the next 
round of trick-taking. With the defined set of rules for Variant III, the person who leads the next round is 
always the person to the right of the player who distributes cards from the central stack. From playtesting, it 
was found that sometimes players would get distracted by the dealing of the cards from the central stack and 
would not immediately know who would put down the leading card for the next round. To make this explicit, 
Variant IV was created. 
 
 
VARIANT IV 
 
 
Variant IV is the same as Variant III except for the following change. Again, the person to the left of the 
winner of the previous trick is able to view the top card of the central stack. This person will be referred to as 
“Kat” to avoid confusion. If Kat chooses to take this card, she deals one card each to the rest of the players so 

that the winner of the last round is the last to receive a card. The winner then leads the next round. If, instead, 
Kat decides to pass the card to the next player, she then continues to deal one card to the remaining players 
such that Kat is the last player to receive a card. Kat is then the person who leads the next round. To 
summarize the rules, Kat has two choices: 
 
   1. If Kat chooses to keep the card, the winner of the last round leads the next round 
   2. If Kat chooses to pass the card, she leads the next round. 
 
 
The objective of this variant was to make it clear which player would lead the next round; the last player to 
receive a card after cards are dealt from the central stack is the one who leads the next round. The variant was 
playtested by Group B a total of five times. 
 
 
This rule change drastically changed the strategy of the game. Often, it is advantageous to be the last person 
to place a card down in a round of trick-taking because this person is able to base their strategy on the actions 
of the other players. However, in this version, if a player chooses to pass the top card of the stack to their 
opponent, he is forced to lead the next round. This is usually a disadvantage unless the player has a very good 
idea of what his opponents has or if the player has trump cards or high cards; however, since the player lost 
the last round, it is somewhat unlikely that he has good enough cards to win the trick, especially towards the 
end of the game. It was then usually a disadvantage for the losing team to pass the card—when the player 
passes the card, he is gambling on receiving a higher card than the one he passes on, and he is forced to lead 
the next round. As a result, the winning team usually won by a large margin. Because this variant was 
unbalanced, the changes made were discarded. In the end, Variant III was the most successful in creating an 
engaging game that had a good balance of random and non-random elements. 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
 
Variant III proved to be a successful bridge variant. The use of negative feedback helped give the losing team 
a better chance of winning and helped keep the game balanced. The addition of the central stack forced 
players to think about what cards were left in the stack on top of thinking about what cards were in their 
opponents hands, increasing the uncertainty of information in the game. Dealing eight cards to each player 
allowed the central stack to play a significant role in the game without having the bids be too low since 
players had a good idea of what to bid based on the cards they were originally given. Playtesting helped 
determine what elements made the game more enjoyable for the players in all of the variants, and helped 
generate the final ruleset for Variant III.
