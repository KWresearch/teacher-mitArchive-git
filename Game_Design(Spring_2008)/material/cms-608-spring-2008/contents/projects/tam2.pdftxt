The  “All-Trump” Bridge Variant 

Charles  Tam 

March  17,  2008 

Bridge  is  a  trick-taking  card  game.  Play  occurs  between  two  pairs  of  players,  with  the  members  of  each  pair 
seated  across  from  one  another.  The  goal  of  the  game  is  to  score  as  many  points  as  possible,  or  to  be  the  ﬁrst 
to  reach  a  certain  number  of  points,  depending  on  which  scoring  variant  of  bridge  one  is  playing. 

Before  any  card  play  occurs,  there  is  an  auction  for  a  contract.  During  this  auction,  players  guess  how  many 
tricks  they  can  take during play.  One  team,  the  oﬀense, will  successfully bid  the  contract  and will have  to make 
a prescribed number of tricks out of thirteen  in order to score points.  The other team,  the defense,  scores points 
for  preventing  the  oﬀense  from  completing  their  contract.  In  addition  to  deﬁning  the  critical  number  of  tricks 
for  the  oﬀense  to  take,  the  contract  also  indicates  what  the  trump  suit  is;  or,  in  the  case  of  “no  trump,”  that 
there  is  no  trump  suit.  Contracts  consist  of  a  level,  which  is  a  number  between  1  and  7  inclusive,  and  a  suit. 
Suits  are  arranged  in  increasing  order  as  “Clubs,  Diamonds,  Hearts,  Spades,  No  Trump.” 

It  is  important  to  note  that  each  player  makes  his  bids  without  any  explicit  knowledge  of  his  partner’s  hand. 
Instead, during the course of bidding, partners may agree to attach meaning to certain bids to convey information 
about  their  hand.  For  example,  a  player  may  open  with  “1♠”  to  indicate  that  he  has  a  certain  number  of  the 
honors  (Ace,  King,  Queen,  Jack),  and  at  least  ﬁve  of  the  Spades.  The  amount  of  expression  viable  using  these 
systems  is  constrained  by  always  bidding  a  higher  contract,  unless  one  chooses  to  pass.  Using  the  complex 
bidding  conventions  that  have  come  from  this  usage  of  the  auction,  a  player  may  ascertain  with  a  surprising 
amount  of  precision  the  holdings  of  his  partner.  Players may  indicate  important  features  of  their  hand,  such  as 
strength,  a  good  holding  of  honors;  length,  a  large  number  of  cards  in  one  suit;  or  shortness,  a  dearth  of  cards 
in  a  suit  that may  be  exploited  for  trumping.  The  auction  terminates  when  three  consecutive  players  pass. 

Once  the  contract  has  been  determined,  play  starts.  One  person  in  the  oﬀensive  pair  is  the  declarer,  the  person 
who ﬁrst named the contract suit.  The other person is the dummy, whose hand is played face-up by the declarer. 
The  ﬁrst  trick  is  led  by  the  person  to  the  left  of  the  declarer.  Play  proceeds  clockwise  around  the  table,  where 
each  trick  is  led  by  the  winner  of  the  previous  trick  until  players  are  out  of  cards. 

The  “All  Trump”  bridge  variant  introduces  a  sixth  possible  contract  suit,  “All  Trump,”  so  that  the  ranking  of 
the  contract  suits  in  increasing  order  is  Clubs,  Diamonds,  Hearts,  Spades,  No  Trump,  All  Trump.  The  initial 
rule  was  that  if  one  is  unable  to  play  the  led  suit,  one  may  play  any  other  suit  and  it  is  automatically  trump. 
After  the  ﬁrst  trump  suit  is  played,  one must  follow  the  trump  suit  if  unable  to  follow  the  led  suit;  if  one  is  also 
unable  to  follow  the  trump  suit,  then  one  may  play  a  second  trump  suit,  which  is  regarded  as  beating  the  ﬁrst 
trump  suit. 
For  example,  suppose  that  South  leads  ♠9.  West,  who  is  void  in  Spades  (that  is,  he  has  no  Spades),  plays  ♦5 
as  a  trump.  North  now must  follow  South’s  suit  if  his  is  able;  if  his  is  unable,  then  he  should  follow West’s  suit; 
if  he  is  also  unable  to  do  that,  only  then  may  he  play  a  new  suit  as  trump.  Thus  we  might  have  N  ♦3,  E  ♠K, 
in  which  case West  wins  with  ♦5;  or  N  ♣T,  E  ♦8,  where  North  wins;  or  N  ♠A,  E  ♦Q,  in  which  East  wins.

This  ﬁrst  version  was  playtested  by  people  who  had  experience  in  trick-taking  games,  but  not  with  contract 
bridge  proper.  Players  ignored  the  auction  phase  of  the  game,  under  the  assumption  that  contract  was  always 
1  All-Trump  (7  tricks  required  to  fulﬁll  contract),  in  order  to  ensure  the  testing  of  the  variant  mechanics.  An 
illustrative  example  of  play  is  given  in  the  Appendix. 

Testers  observed  that  the  person  to  lead  the  last  trick  would  lose  it.  In  that  particular  trick,  in  which  each 
player  as  one  card,  the  pair  that  has  oﬀ-suit  cards  wins.  In  particular,  this means  that  the  lead  has  one  chance 
to  mismatch  his  own  suit  (that  is,  his  partner’s  card),  whereas  the  leader’s  opposition  has  two  chances  to  do 
so.  This  principle  actually  extends  frequently  through  the  couple  hands  preceding  the  last,  and  indeed  through 
the  whole  game  it  is  felt  that  the  team  of  the  person  leading  has  a  disadvantage.  This  was  observed  as  tricks 
frequently  went  back  and  forth.  In  other  words,  this  formulation  of  the  All  Trump  rules  actually  punishes 
players  for  winning  tricks!  A  simple  thought  experiment  suﬃces  to  show  that  it’s  also  impossible  for  one  team 
to  take  all  13  tricks. 

Testers  also  tended  to  lead  from  their  shortest  suits whenever  possible,  in  order  to  create  voids  quickly.  Testers 
that went beyond this simplistic strategy and counted cards to predict other players’ holdings were not rewarded 
for their higher understanding of the game,  since the player that won a trick brought a disadvantage to his team 
in  the  next  trick.  As  there  was  little  that  could  be  done  to  inﬂuence  the  outcome  of  a  game  beyond  happening 
to  have  an  extra  honor,  testers  reached  consensus  that  the  game  favored  luck  over  skill  too  heavily. 

The  second  iteration  was  played  with  the  additional  rule  that  when  trumping,  the  card  being  trumped  may 
not  be  any  more  than  n  =  5  values  above  the  trumping  card.  Therefore  in  ♠4 –  ♥8 –  ♠Q –  ♠5,  the  heart 
wins  because  the  Queen  is  only  four  values  above  the  8.  However,  in  ♠4 –  ♥6 –  ♠Q –  ♠5,  the  Queen  wins. 
Multi-suit  trumping  still  applies,  as  in  ♦6 –  ♥J –  ♠9 –  ♣2,  in  which  the  Spade  wins  because  it  is  close  enough 
to  the  ♥J,  but  the  Club  does  not  because  it  is  trying  to  trump  the  ♠9.  This  alteration  only  slightly  ﬁxed 
the  aforementioned  problems  of  excess  trumping.  In  addition,  testers  felt  that  too  much  mental  ﬁguring  was 
required,  since  they  would  have  to  do  arithmetic  and  track  7’s,  8’s,  and  9’s  as  potential  trumps  in  addition  to 
the  usual  honors  T,  J,  Q,  K,  A.  Testing  low  values  as  n = 2, 3  restricted  trumps  too  heavily.  Values  of  n = 5, 7 
gave  too much  range  and  did  not  remedy  the  issues  named  above. 

The next  iteration of this variant deﬁnes the trump suit during a trick as the suit above the  led suit,  rather than 
the  most  recent  new  suit  played.  Thus  when  Diamonds  is  led,  Hearts  is  trump;  but  when  Spades  is  led,  Clubs 
is  trump.  For  example,  in ♥7 – ♥K – ♠4 – ♣T,  the  Spade wins.  This modiﬁcation was  intended  to  restrict  the 
number  of  potential  trump  cards  in  any  given  trick,  but  preserve  the  sense  that  any  suit  could  be  trump  under 
the  right  conditions.  It  also  eliminates  the  emergent  behavior  that  statistically  punishes  players  for  winning 
tricks.  The  resulting  rules  were  intended  to  create  a  less  chaotic  All  Trump  contract  play.  An  example  from 
this  iteration  is  given  in  the  Appendix. 

Randomly distributed hands were  less  strongly won  than  this one, as would be expected.  In order to  investigate 
more realistically,  testers began re-shuﬄing deals which were considered unfavorable to All Trump play.  Beyond 
that cardplay now felt more orderly and strategic, observations recorded from this iteration pertained to contract 
choice  in  the  auction;  we  will  discuss  this  presently. 

In  addition  to  ensuring  that All Trump  cardplay  is not  cumbersome  to player, we must  also  ensure  that playing 
in  such  a  contract  is  favorable with  respect  to  the  auction metagame.  Eﬀectively,  we must  check  that  there  are 
hands  that  are  best  played  in  All  Trump  or,  failing  that,  that  there  is  an  incentive  to  playing  All  Trump  and 
scoring  fewer  tricks  over  playing  a  suited  contract  and  scoring  more. 

For  this  iteration,  our  playtesters  were  experienced  bridge  players  who  could  compete  at  the  national  level  or 

2 

better.  Testing  was  done  over  the  Internet.  A  few  practice  hands  were  played  as  before,  without  auction,  so 
that  testers  could  become  familiar  with  the  mechanic.  In  particular,  testers  were  to  gain  an  understanding  of 
how  to  determine  when  to  play  an  All  Trump  contract.  They  were  then  dealt  cards  and  bid  on  them  without 
playing.  Hands  were  revealed  and  testers  discussed  the  accuracy  of  their  bids. 

Testers  favored  playing  All  Trump  contracts  in  two  cases:  With  two-suited  hands  that  mismatched  with  part­
ner’s, as in 5♠/2♥/1♦/5♣ partnered with 1♠/5♥/5♦/2♣; or with minor-suited hands that would produce more 
points  in  an All Trump  contract  than  in  one  of  the  appropriate minor.  For  example,  a  pair with  a  deﬁnite  club 
ﬁt  and  good  values might  prefer  to  play  in All Trump  instead  of  in Clubs,  since  they would  get more  points  per 
trick,  and  would  reach  “game”  faster. 

Testers  considered  playing  All  Trump  contracts  to  be  more  diﬃcult  than  playing  No  Trump  contracts.  As  a 
result,  they  favored  bidding  schemes  that  placed  All  Trump  higher  than  No  Trump  in  the  auction  suits,  and 
scoring  schemes  that  awarded  slightly  more  points  per  All  Trump  trick  than  for  No  Trump  tricks.  Bidding 
conventions  tended  imbue  All  Trump  as  signoﬀ  when  bid  (that  is,  partner  should  not  attempt  to  escalate  to  a 
higher  contract),  or  as  artiﬁcially  meaning  strong  multi-suited  hands. 

The  ﬁnal  set  of  rules  is  as  follows: 

•	 During  a  trick  in  an  All  Trump  contract,  the  trump  suit  is  the  suit  above  the  suit  that  is  led.  Clubs  are 
considered  to  be  above  Spades.  If  there  are  multiple  cards  played  in  the  trump  suit,  the  highest  of  them 
wins. 
•	 All  Trump  is  ordered  above  No  Trump  in  the  contract  suits. 
•	 In  an  All  Trump  contract,  40  points  are  awarded  per  trick  taken  starting  with  the  seventh. 

Extensive  tweaking  of  this  last  rule  has  yet  to  be  done.  It  may  be  favorable  to  reward  enough  points  to  reach 
“game” (more than 100 points) in All Trump more quickly than in No Trump.  This value is important to bridge 
players,  as  extra  points  are  rewarded  for  bidding  and  fulﬁlling  a  “game”  contract.  However,  setting  rewards  for 
All  Trump  much  higher  may  unbalance  the  game.  Players  are  rewarded  points  for  making  contract  tricks,  but 
if  they  fail  to make  the  required  threshold  they are  instead punished by a  larger number of points.  If All Trump 
tricks  become  worth  too  much,  it  may  become  advantageous  to  bid  All  Trump  in  unreasonable  situations,  just 
because  the  expected  gain  from  doing  so  becomes  positive.  With  these  few modiﬁcations, All Trump  can  easily 
be  a  reasonable  strategic  variant  of  Bridge.

West  leads  with  the  ♣9  intending  to  create  a  void  as  quickly  as  possible.  South  wins  tricks  in  Clubs,  Hearts, 
and Diamonds, ﬁnishing  in  the dummy.  He  then  leads  into his  spade void and  trumps with a Club  from his own 
hand.  Now  South  plays  and  wins  his  ♣A,  creating  a  second  void.

South wants  to  lead  a Club  from  dummy  in  this  position,  hoping  that East  does  not  have  a Club  void.  He  does 
not  care  if West has a Club void,  since he  expects  to  trump  in Diamonds and  force West  to  follow him  into  that 
suit.  Unfortunately,  he  has  no  way  to  win  a  trick  in  dummy,  so  he  plays  a  heart  to  move  toward  a  void.  West 
and East win  four  of  the  next  ﬁve  tricks  as  they  discover  their  complementary  voids  and  trump  in  Spades when 
South  leads  into  Hearts.

West  opens  by  making  good  on  his  two  aces  before  trumping  becomes  an  issue.  He  then  plays  ♦J,  reasoning 
that  he  wants  to  draw  out  one  of  North’s  honors  (this  is  a  mistake;  West  would  get  an  extra  trick  in  the  end 
by  cashing  his ♥K  early  along with  the Aces).  South  instead  plays  low  from  dummy  and wins  in  hand with  his 
singleton  ♦Q.

South  now  plays  a  Spade  to  North’s  Clubs.  South  makes  good  on  the  ♣A  in  dummy,  creating  a  void  that 
will  feed  directly  into  his  long  Diamond  suit;  followed  by  a  low  Diamond  to  the  singleton  Heart  in  hand  (he  is 
surprised  by East’s Diamond  void,  but  the ♥Q  is  good  enough  to  beat East’s weak  heart  holdings).  Now  South 
plays  two  of  his  own  Clubs  to  North’s  Diamonds,  and  North’s  two  Hearts  to  his  own  Spades.

South  takes  two  of  the  last  three  tricks.  He  play  the  ♠K  ﬁrst,  winning  it  on  its  own  (he  can  do  this  securely, 
since  by  card-counting  he  knows  that  he  holds  the  only  two  unplayed  Clubs),  then  playing  a  Club  to  North’s 
♦A  and  losing  the  last  trick  to  West’s  ♥K  trump.  North/South  therefore  takes  10  of  the  13  tricks,  and  could 
have  bid  and made  4AT.
