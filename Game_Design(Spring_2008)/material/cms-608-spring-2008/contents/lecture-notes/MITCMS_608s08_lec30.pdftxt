What is a puzzle? 

• It’s a problem with one single solution 
• ... but ideally more than one path to that 
solution 
• The opponent is the object puzzle itself, 
not another player 
• “Mental” Challenge (Rollings & Adams) 

The Importance of 
Insight 
• Puzzles provide new ways of thinking about 
the world 
• The solution is logical but also 
• witty 
• surprising 
• different from everyday life 

Parts of a Puzzle 

•  Rules: Problem Description 
• Must be precise, give all necessary 
information (not too much, not too little) 
• It’s a mystery! 
• Goal: Solution 

Types of Insight

Types of Puzzles 

• Language 
• Visual

Language Puzzles 

• Riddles 
Dreaming of apples on a wall, 

And dreaming often, dear, 

I dreamed that, if I counted all, 

--How many would appear? 

-- Lewis Carroll 

Language Puzzles 

• Doublet Puzzle / Word Ladder 
Turn the word HEAD into TAIL, by changing one letter at a time , 
forming a new word each time to do so 

Change IRON into LEAD by introducing a new letter or by 
rearranging the letters of the word, at any step, instead of 
introducing a new letter. But you may not do both in the same step. 

Lewis Carroll

HEAD 
HEAL 

TEAL

Visual Puzzles 

•  Play with visual shapes 
and space 
•  Dissection and 
Arrangement 
•  Mazes 
•  Hidden Images 
•  Spot the Difference 
•  Geometrical 
Challenges 

Visual Puzzles 
•  Dissection Puzzles 

Haberdasher's Problem: 
Dissect a square into pieces to 
form a tr iangle , with only four cuts . 
(Henr y Dudeney) 

Divide this ﬁgure into four pieces , 
which must be identical in their 
shape and size . Some pieces can be 
mirror reﬂections of others .

Visual Puzzles 

•  Geometrical Challenge 
Without the pencil 
leaving the paper, can 
four straight lines be 
drawn along the nine 
dots? 

Visual Puzzles 

•  Geometrical Challenge 
Can you draw the 
Tr iforce in one stroke? 

Logic Puzzles 

• Play with ideas 
• Deduction 
• Truth 
• Deception 

Logic Puzzles 
• Deduction Puzzles 
In a cer tain company, Bob, Janet and Shirley hold the positions 
of director, engineer and accountant, but not necessar ily in that 
order. 

The accountant, who is an only child, earns the least. 

Shirley, who is marr ied to Bob’s brother, earns more than the 
engineer. 

What position does each person ﬁll? 

Logic Puzzles 
• Truth Puzzles: “knights or knaves” 

The Dodo says that the Hatter tells lies 

The Hatter says that the March Hare tells lies 

The March Hare says that the Dodo and the Hatter tell lies 

Who is telling the truth? 

-- Lewis Carroll 

Logic Puzzles 
• Logic puzzles based on deception 

How many cubic inches of dir t are there in a hole that is one foot 
deep, two feed wide , and six feet long? 

How many times can you subtract the number one from the 
number twenty-ﬁve? 

If 3 cats kill 3 rats in 3 minutes , how long will it take 100 cats to kill 
100 rats? 

Number Puzzles 

• Play with mathematical operations, patterns 
and combinatorics 
• Magic Squares 
• River-Crossing Puzzles 
• Containers and Weights 
• Cryptarithms 

Number Puzzles

Number Puzzles 
• River-crossing puzzles 
A farmer is returning from market, where he bought a goat, a wolf 
and cabbage . On the way home he must cross a r iver. His boat is 
little , allowing him to take only one of the three things . He can't keep 
the goat and the cabbage together (because the goat would eat it), 
nor the goat with the wolf (because the goat would be eaten). 

How shall the farmer get ever ything on the other side (without any 
harm)? 

What is the minimum number of tr ips across the r iver? 

Number Puzzles

How to design puzzles? 
•  Change the rules of an  

existing game (basically 
what we’ve been doing 
all term) 
•  Change the skin 
•  Vary parameters:

scale, size

•  Extend the rules

Colour Sudoku:instead of ﬁlling in the numbers 1 to 9 
in each of the 3 by 3 blocks , you must enter 1 to 9 in 
the 9 boxes of each colour - i.e . there are nine yellow 
boxes , and the yellow boxes must contain the digits 1 
to 9.

Exercise: Mini-Mystery 

Hunt

•	 Phase I: Design a puzzle using MIT as your ﬁctional 
framework (1 hour) 
•	 Groups of 2 
•	 Pick up one index card and design a variant on 
that type of puzzle. 
•  If you ﬁnish your puzzle and there’s time, you can 

make another of that type or a different one

•	 At the end of the hour, please hand in a piece of 
paper with the puzzle problem (but not the 
solution!). Include your names on top of the page. 

Exercise: Mini-Mystery 
Hunt 

• Phase II: Solve the puzzles! (30 min) 
• Everybody will get  a copy of all the puzzles 
• You can solve them in pairs or individually 
• Don’t ask the designers for the solution 
yet! 

Exercise: Mini-Mystery 
Hunt 
•  Phase III (30 min): Solving the puzzles together 
•  If we cannot solve the puzzle, its designers 
will have to explain the solution 
•  Puzzle critique: 
• Was it easy / difﬁcult? 
• Why couldn’t you solve it (if that’s the 
case)? 
•  Is it fun? How / why?
