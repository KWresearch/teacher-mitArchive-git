Notes by Clara Rhee 
Guest lecturer Sam Ford 
 
Wrestling (Pro)
-  pro-wrestling – sports entertainment 
-  amateur wrestling – athleticism 
-  wrestling – possibly the first form of human “competition”/game 
-  pro-wrestling – not a game but play 
-  young animals/humans especially enjoy playfighting 
-  helps develop hunting skills?  Social cues? 
-  wrestling became popular in North American during Civil War 
- 
traveling carnival/circus acts challenging audience members 
- 
scripting began to pick up the pace and keep audience interest during lengthy matches 
-  “double cross” – when a match veers off the script 
-  wrestling as a business 
- 
it’s always been about putting butts in seats 
-  “if people buy tickets, it’s wrestling” 
-  but as sport journalist stopped covering… 
- 
radio was good for baseball, but not for wrestling – the terminology didn’t exist 
-  TV helped build the vocabulary 
- 
for a while, TV was for bringing in the local audience 
-  as cable came around, national audience 
-  bigger business of franchising 
-  growing building of narratives 
-  “male soap operas”
