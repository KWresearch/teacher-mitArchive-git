CMS.608 – 26 February 2008 
Notes by Clara Rhee 
 
What is luck? 
-  Assumes a possible win condition 
-  Even in a purely skill based game, like chess, there’s uncertainty 
-  Random vs. uncertainty 
-  How can random be used? 
-  Advancement 
- 
Initial conditions 
-  Percentage of success/damage 
- 
It’s hard to amplify luck 
-  Luck is usually used to even things out 
-  LET’S PLAY  
-  Thunderbolt – purely random 
-  Pig – some decision making 
-  The amount of risk changes perception of luck 
-  Note “Eeny-miny-moe” 
-  Supposed to be “random choice” 
-  But there are extra verses and ways to adjust the outcome if it’s not favourable 
-  Only an illusion of random
