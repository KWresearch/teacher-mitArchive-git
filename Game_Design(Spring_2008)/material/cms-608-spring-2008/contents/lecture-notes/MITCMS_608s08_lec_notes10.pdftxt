CMS.608 – 28 February 2008 
Notes by Clara Rhee 
 
-  Discuss the quotes from the reading that students wrote on the boards 
 
-  The definition of Hardcore is sketchy 
-  “up to 8 games” is misleading 
-  Someone who is seriously dedicated to WoW may play many \hours in one day 
every day without playing any other game 
-  Some casual gamers can play lots of little games for 20 minutes each. 
-  Someone might not consider himself a Hardcore gamer, despite other people 
thinking he is 
It’s all relative and complex 
-  “it depends on who’s talking about who” 
-  From a business perspective it’s all about purchasing patterns, not playing patterns 
-  The Myers-Briggs reading draws a lot from common stereotypes – not just of gamers, 
but of extroverts, women 
- 
It doesn’t address the different reason people play games 
-  Some games are very social – Wii, Guitar Hero, Rock Band 
-  Especially with networking capabilities 
-  What do those games have in common? 
-  The controller is easy to use 
-  The technology itself can be a barrier – never forget about the player 
experience and the learning curve! 
-  Who’s attracted to Guitar Hero/Rock Band? 
-  Music fans, wannabe rock stars, as in atypical gamers 
-  The concepts are new, but easy! 
-  The skills for playing Guitar Hero are not the same as the skills for playing 
guitar 
-  Can casual and Hardcore gamers play the same game? 
-  Levels of difficulty can adjust the game to appeal to different types of players 
-  Save points can make the game more accessible 
-  The very early games had no save points 
-  You had to drill a game until that “perfect” win run. 
-  But recent games allow for different approaches 
-  Additional rewards and goals 
-  Everyone plays games – there is a game for everyone! 
-  So many stereotypes on top of stereotypes! 
-  From a marketing perspective, this works. 
-  But from a marketing perspective, the Wii shouldn’t have sold… 
-  Marketing does understand the element of prestige that come with the  Hardcore 
community 
-  They look down on the Wii for being too accessible and broadly marketed 
-  Another consideration is the business models  
-  Xbox 360 and PS3 consoles are loss leaders 
-  They need to keep the players buying lots of expensive games to make a profit. 

-  They’re also pushing their machines as multimedia devices – see the Bluray 
on PS3 
-  What about just making better games? 
 
-  The categories (from Bartle) can be limiting 
-  Most players are more than one category, without one predominant type 
-  What type is an admin? 
-  Does this apply to non-videogames? 
-  A game can be very appealing to one type of player 
-  But those games don’t tend to be very “rich”… 
-  Games can specifically appeal to an audience through culture
