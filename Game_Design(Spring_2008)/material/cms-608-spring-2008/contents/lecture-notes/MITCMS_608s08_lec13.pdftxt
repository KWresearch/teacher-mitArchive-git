Information as a measure of uncertainty (possibility space)  


Information = freedom? 

Information - Choice – degrees of freedom  

Uncertainty - Noise + Information  


Noise is not actually bad, especially for games! 

Inefficiency as a source of fun. 


Applications of Noise – Obfuscation, encryption, 

misdirection 

Obfuscation as a means of introducing noise, as well as 

communication constraints. Codes and encryption. 

Pictionary/charades  

Misdirection - Decision making as a source of noise  

(deliberate or accidental bluffing, wild-goose chases)  

Redundancy opposes noise. Error correction, referees, 

photo-finishes,  


Information as a commodity (knowledge) 

Something that can be traded?  


Perfect and imperfect information (has nothing to do with  

“uncertainty”) 


Pearce: 

Known to all 

Known to one 

Hidden to all  

Random 


Exercise: Clue  


Where does probabilistic information lie? (Say, the  

remaining cards of a deck)  

What about rules? Are they information? 

What about rules you discover midway? (Fluid, Fluxx, 

computer games) 

What about the hidden cards in Clue?  


How does memory fit in this?  

How about player computational power?  

Games with decreasing uncertainty?  


Zimmerman: Objective and perceived information – is this  

a useful distinction? 

Is objective information just Shannon’s “information”, a  

measure of uncertainty? 

If a limited resource has been played (trumps, Scrabble  

letters), how has uncertainty changed? How does this affect  

Shannon’s possibility space? Your access to “perceived 

information”? 


Tactics versus strategy  

Managing information overload (Transparency versus  

confusion) 


The transformative power of hidden information 

New information as a source of changing strategies and 

goals 

But also the source of possible confusion (conflicting  

models of information)  


What about being able to distinguish secret, but valid 
information from misinformation (or noise)?

RPS variants 

Don’t forget Friday Games at GAMBIT 

RPS variant 1


• Play continual rounds of rock-paper-
scissors 
• Do not throw the same symbol twice in a 
row 
• Win 3 rounds to win the game, ties don’t 
count 

RPS variant 2


• Hold one hand behind your back 
• Choose rock, paper, or scissors with the 
hidden hand 
• Play continual rounds of RPS with your 
other hand 
• Do not throw your hidden symbol twice in 
a row 

RPS variant 3


• Hold one hand behind your back 
• Choose rock, paper, or scissors with the 
hidden hand 
• Play continual rounds of RPS with your 
other hand 
• Only your hidden symbol can be thrown 
twice in a row
