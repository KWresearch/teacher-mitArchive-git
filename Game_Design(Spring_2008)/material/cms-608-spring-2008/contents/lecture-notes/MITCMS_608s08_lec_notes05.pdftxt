Notes by Clara Rhee 
 
−  Let's play a game! 
−  20 questions with games 
−  but you can't ask about the theme, or specific characters, or setting 
−  only the formal elements 

 
−  What were the useful questions? 
−  digital? 
−  # of players (fixed, multi) 
−  card/board/tokens 
−  athletic 
−  # of lives (chances) 
−  gambling 
−  elimination 
−  How do we think of games as formal systems? 
Is genre a formal element question? 
− 
−  Some genres have very similar formal elements and are only distinguishable by the 
forbidden specifics (i.e. adventure games) 
−  The terminology we use is often inappropriate or irrelevant for some types of games 
−  a “token” means different things for board games or arcade games 
−  And what about digital versions of analog games? 
In the end, the questions end up being about mechanics 
− 
−  We all think about games differently 
−  We need to come to a consensus of vocabulary 
−  How do we do this? 
It's hard, especially with constant new innovations and academics can't impose 
− 
terminology on the industry 
there are differences between how designers, players, critics, marketers talk 
− 
about games 
−  How do you personally game vocabulary? 
−  The community you're exposed to 
−  The connotations of a term that a designer/marketer puts in a game is determined by 
the players and their experiences 
−  Players also name game phenomenon that the designers may not have predicted (i.e. 
goldfarming) 
Is this how (good) games are designed?  By duplicating patterns?  By using the 
vocabulary?  With a set of parameters? 
−  NO.  That is not what makes a game good.  That is not what the vocabulary is 
meant for. 
It helps us understand a game 
− 
It helps us identify families of games 
− 
It helps us make significant changes 
− 
−  Don't get too wrapped up in vocabulary! 
- You can construct “dictionaries” by analyzing games or papers
