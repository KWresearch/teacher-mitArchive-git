Game Design
CMS.608/CMS.864

Jesper Juul

About today

• Meaningful play (the what)

• Iterative game design (the 
how)

• Exercise in iterative game 
design

Everybody here is a game 
designer
• Change rules in board games. 
• More money to start with in 
Monopoly. 
• Card game variations.
• Change the playing field in soccer.
• Pretend to be somebody else.

What is game design?

• About the player experience. (The player 
should have the fun.)

• Challenging the player in a pleasurable way.

• Design a thing and design an experience.

• Paradoxes: Many experiences from the same 
fixed set of rules.

Two gods (according to 
Chris Crawford)
• Storyteller: Fly bird, fly. Blow 
wind, blow.

• Designer of the laws of nature:
Birds can fly, wind can blow, 
gravity. (This is game design.)

OK, but what are you 
designing?

• Good game designs results in 
what?

Meaningful Play

• Salen & Zimmerman 

• Meaningful play: When relation 
between action and outcome is 
discernable and integrated

Game design documents
Tim Ryan: The Anatomy of a Design Document (1999)

• Introduction (a few lines)
• Background (optional – other relevant 
information)
• Description (describe the game to the play as 
“you ... experience, do etc...”)
• Key features (what stands out)
• Genre
• Platforms
• Concept art (perhaps)
• !Target group

How to make games

• 1977 – ca. 1990: Just start coding
• 1990 – ca. 2002: Design document 
up front
• 2002 – present: Prototype and 
iterate

Mark Cerny’s Method
Mark Cerny & Michael John: Game Development Myth vs. Method (2002)

Myths:
1. Scheduling is possible
2. Don’t throw out good work
3. Milestones
4. Alpha = first playable
5. Killing a project is bad
6. The bigger the design 
document, the better
7. The consumer is king

Iterative Game Design

Zimmerman: Play as Research

1. Come up with a basic idea. 
2. Implement a prototype that 
demonstrates the idea.
3. Playtest it. 
4. Revise.
5. Repeat

A Very Short Development 
Cycle (20 mins). 4:15
1. Start with Rock Paper Scissors
2. Play it
3. Make changes
4. Repeat at least 3 times.

work?
