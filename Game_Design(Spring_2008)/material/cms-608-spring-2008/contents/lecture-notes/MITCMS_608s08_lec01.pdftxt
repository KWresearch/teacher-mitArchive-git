Fun: The holy grail of games, but an ill-defined term 
for purposes of game analysis. Marc LeBlanc’s GDC 
speech on complexity warns against the word “fun” 
being vague. He describes ways in which players 
often derive pleasure from games. (Subsequently, 
we’ve added to that list.)  

Clearing: Many games allow the player to clean up a 
scattering of interactive elements. There’s a simple 
pleasure players seem to get from ‘Hoovering’ their 
way across a room full of gold coins or revealing the 
blacked out sections of the maps in RTS games or 
RPGs. 

Collection: The act of accumulating things. (Could be 
referred to as Consumerism.) Sometimes tied to the 
desire to complete a set. Examples: Collecting coins 
in Mario. Collecting Magic cards. Buying things in 
The Sims. 

Creation: Bringing something into existence. 
Building something that feels like it belongs to you. 
Examples: Constructing and growing a city in 
SimCity. Creating and arranging a fish tank in El-
fish. 

Discovery: Space to explore and gain mastery over. 
Sometimes conceptual space, like the rules to a new 
game. Examples: It’s fun to range over a new (often 
blackened-out) map in many strategy games like 
Warcraft or Sacrifice. You can see players go through 
phases when playing successive games of Onhe 
Furcht und Adel–they gain enjoyment over 
discovering the parameters of the game (and the 
successful strategies therein), then mastering the 
game.  

Diversion: Pleasure derived from performing routine 
game system activities–the mechanical act of 
manipulating the game. Examples: Playing an hour of 
Windows Solitaire.  

Expectation: Waiting with exciting for some 
perceived reward or entertaining moment. Examples: 
The thrill of gambling; blindly waiting to see if 
you’ve ‘won’ playing slots. (DX1 featured a similar 
chest lock picking dynamic–the player spend a lock 
pick and waited for a few expectant seconds to see 
what he had won.) 

Experience: Allowing the player to engage in a real-
world activity that is beyond his practical means. 
Examples: Killing a person with a pistol. Flying a 
fighter plane in a flight sim. Driving crash-up derby 
cars in a mud arena car game. Getting to play against 
Tiger Woods in a golf match. 

Expression: Self discovery/exploration. Identity 
expression. Examples: Choosing a self-gratifying 
nickname, character name or call sign in a game like 
Quake, EverQuest or X-Wing Vs Tie Fighter. 
Choosing a character race/group in an RPG that is 

identified with an archetype or demeanor. Deck 
construction in Magic the Gathering. 

Fantasy: Vehicle for imaginative or impossible 
activity. Examples: Flying on the back of a red 
dragon. Battling the undead. Piloting a space ship.  

Fellowship: Social aspects of gaming. Examples: 
Working with squad mates in FireTeam to form a 
plan and attempt to score a goal. Standing around, 
chatting in the town in Diablo.  

Goal-completion: Being given a clear goal and 
actually recognizing that it has been accomplished. 
Example: Completing a bridge level in Bridge 
Builder. Completing a mission in C&C (in which the 
player is often given very clear goals, like, “Build at 
least 12 tanks.”). 

Investment: Spending time on some game element 
and thus coming to value it. Examples: Slowly 
building up a 60th level druid in EverQuest. 

Media-migration: Players desire to interact with 
familiar (and often well-liked) fictional elements 
from other media. The keys to this are familiarity 
(with the established fiction) and interaction. For 
instance, during beta-testing of the Aliens vs. 
Predator game, players demanded the option of 
carrying and using Hicks’ shotgun, even though it 
was an antiquated, inferior weapon. In Star Trek 
games, players get excited at the option of attempting 
their own solutions to classic problems/encounters 
posed by the television series. Using a light saber 
from Star Wars carries its own appeal.  

Narrative: Drama that unfolds over time, creates 
tension, engages us. Examples: Learning of “Tommy 
and Rebecca’s” situation in System Shock 2 and 
finally seeing them run down the hall toward escape. 
(Embedded narrative.) The dramatic events that occur 
in a Quake deathmatch as a result of the players’ 
actions. (Emergent narrative.) 

Obstacle: Encountering a challenge and overcoming 
it. Examples: Making a difficult jump in SSX. 

Sensation: Aurally or visually pleasing aesthetics. 
Examples: The first time the player steps out onto a 
hill and overlooks the world in Sacrifice, with its 
amazing art, he is in sheer awe and feels pleasure. 

Victory: Putting the beat-down on an opponent. Some 
people are driven to compete and gain pleasure from 
winning. Examples: Players love being the top-
ranking player in a Quake deathmatch.
