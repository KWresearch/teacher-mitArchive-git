Notes by Clara Rhee 
 
Simulation and Abstraction
-  what do you want to abstract in a game? 
-  complex maneuvers – physical stunts 
-  different characters 
-  health 
-  “world” – limits and characteristics 
-  what do you get for free? 
- 
say you’re playing a LARP 
-  playspace 
-  character movement, traits 
-  physics 
-  complex metaphors can be made with visual representation 
- 
see the movement of the character in Passage 
- 
time becomes horizontal movement 
is there a game that abstracts celebration? 
-  52-card pick up! 
-  probably a good representation, bad game 
-  every time you abstract something, you’re limiting the player’s understanding 
-  do simulations need to be numerical? 
-  without abstraction, you don’t know what’s allowed in the game 
-  abstractions define possibilities 
-  allows you to skip over the boring stuff, or make the boring stuff more interesting, 
or make hard things easy 
-  abstractions also make certain things morally acceptable – destruction of cities, war 
- 
things that should be simulated 
-  conflict – economical, territorial, knowledge 
-  puzzle games are hard to fit in the simulation model 
-  what is Bejeweled simulating/abstracting??? 
-  what is the collection of mechanics that makes a system behave the way it does? 
- 
some games can try to make you forget it’s a game…but that’s not really the point – 
not necessarily engaging 
-  Milgram experiment  
-  was more about submitting to authority 
- 
real as simulated pain and punishment 
feasibility 
-  what’s practical?  What needs to be abstracted? 
- 
it’s just more practical to abstract 
-  Philip’s Theory on Game Design Concerns 
- 
separation 
- 
taking out the boring/awkward bits 
information 
-  having/lacking game knowledge 
-  competition/conflict

- 

-  verisimilitude 
- 
immersion, the appearance of reality 
-  verisimilitude is completely at odds with separation
