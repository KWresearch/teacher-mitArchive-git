Notes by Clara Rhee 
 
Rules and Fiction 
-  Games work just fine without fiction 
-  Many games are completely abstract 
-  So why bother putting in fiction in a game? 
-  Emotional attachment 
-  Personal preferences on outcomes 
-  Chess is a very abstract version of military campaigns, with different fictions in the 
different versions of chess 
-  At this point, does the fiction in chess matter at all? 
-  The political context today is very different  
-  Back in the day, the military analogy was much more real to the players 
-  Games with fiction are meaningful outside of the definition of meaningful play – it 
adds context 
-  So when does the fiction come forward?  Do you care about the fiction? 
-  Depends on the game 
-  Some games almost discourage you from caring by allowing you to skip ahead 
cut scenes with no consequence 
In multiplayer games, the fiction gets pushed back for the human interaction 
-  The players rush each other 
- 
If you can ignore it, you will ignore it 
-  How do you make a player care about the fiction? 
-  “Make it not suck!” 
-  Many stories are too obvious and flat 
-  Some games have a strong “fiction” component (separate events) and a very weak 
story 
-  Hard and fast stories are hard for games  
-  Ex. The Sims have no story given by the game at all 
-  Games are half-real 
-  Winning/losing is real 
-  The fiction is not 
-  Frijda’s Law of Apparent Reality 
-  People care as much as they think it’s real 
-  With games and rules, the rules make you feel like it’s less real, making the fiction 
less effective 

- 

 
Complexity 
-  What kind of a system is the human body? 
-  Periodic?  Not chaotic, not static. 
-  Complexity needs objects, attributes, and a resulting relationship between objects 
-  Most games would be closed systems 
 
-  Why is that (complexity) relevant (to the interaction of games and fiction)? 
 

-  The system of the game needs to include the fiction for the player to care about the 
fiction 
-  A lot of educational games have very bad integration of the lesson and the fiction 
-  Scot Osterweil’s Education Arcade is working on a good educational math game.  
How did he do it? 
-  The math is well integrated 
-  The lesson is found in the environment 
-  Bad educational games are too explicit 
-  The good ones let you work within the system 

 
Brainscripts
-  Everyone has a set of knowledge about phenomenon in the world 
-  The “brainscript” about one thing can be adapted for slight variations 
-  Ex. Going shopping, Christmas, going to the doctor, restaurants 

 
EXERCISE: “1000 Blank White Cards” 
Step 1: Pick a scheme.  Write elements/actions on the cards.  Put cards in bag. 
Step 2: Take turns pulling out random card in pairs for six pairs 
 
Determine win condition. 
-  What kind of questions occurred? 
Step 3: Pitch the game…
