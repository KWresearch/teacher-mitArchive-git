Notes by Clara Rhee

Various types of Poker 
-  For chips … and notoriety!   
- 
If you win in your table, your name will go up on the board 

 
-  Evolve a better Poker! 
  
 
 
 

 
-  Five card draw 
-  Get dealt 5 cards, bet, trade any number of cards, bet again. 
-  Five card stud 
-  One down, the rest up one at a time, betting after each up card. 
-  Texas Hold-Em 
-  Two down, bet, three shared up cards “The flop”, bet, a shared up card “The turn”, 
bet, a shared up card, bet. 

 
-  Was there one variation that was more skill based? 
-  Texas Hold-Em 
-  Why? 
-  Balance between the known and the unknown 
-  How do we know that? 
-  Were people playing for particular goals? 
-  To win 
-  To get on the board 
-  To see other people’s cards 
-  To stay in 
-  To break even 
-  Different versions have different strategies and different criteria for what counts as a 
“good” hand
