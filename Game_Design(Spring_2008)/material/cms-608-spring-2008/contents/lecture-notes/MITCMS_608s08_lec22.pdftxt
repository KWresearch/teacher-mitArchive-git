Positive and negative 
feedback

• Examples in your game designs?

Dynamic Difficulty 
Adjustment
• Good or bad?
• Smooth or irregular?
• In board/card games?

Two kinds of games: 
Emergence and 
progression
• Emergence: A small number of rules yield variation. The 
player uses strategies to play. "More than the sum of its 
parts". 
=Most traditional games, action games, strategy 
games.
(Play using strategy guides.)

• Progression: The player performs a predefined set of 
actions in order to complete the game.
“No more than the sum of its parts". 
=Adventure games.
(Play using a walkthrough.)

Emergence: Indirect 
game design

Screenshot of Counter-Strike removed due to copyright restrictions.
Video game screenshot removed due to copyright restrictions.

Like Quake III, 
but:
There is only 
one life per 
round.
You die easily.
Team-wide 
success criteria.
This completely 
changes the 
game towards 
teamplay.

Game of life

• Does the glider exist?

Emergence cheap but 
dangerous
• Proximity mine
climbing
• Why is this
interesting?

Screenshot of Deus Ex removed due to copyright restrictions.

• Proximity
mines don’t
afford climbing!

Emergence comes from 
generalizability
• Emergence as: “Flexible game system 
that allows the player to find his/her 
own unique solutions to a problem.”
• Emergence comes from the number of 
possible interactions between objects.
• Create as many interactions between 
game objects as possible.
• Not just “gas burns”, but “flammable 
objects”, etc..

Orthogonal unit 
differentiation
• Harvey Smith: Whatever units / things / 
options / stuff you put in the game ...
• ... make sure that they can be evaluated on 
more than one axis.
• Not just differentiate by “cost”
• But differentiate by cost / speed / range / 
payoff / interaction type

Emergence / orthogonal 
exercise
• Starting point: 10*10 grid, 3 players, players take turn 
placing a piece on grid. Winner is the player that takes over 
the entire board. What types of pieces can the players place? 
Can pieces be moved? What do the pieces do to each other?
• Pieces of paper, game pieces made of paper and marked.
• 20 min: In groups, create a game with only one type of piece 
- that is “emergent”. Game with simple components where 
game is unpredictable in an interesting way.

• 20 min: Create orthogonal units – several types of pieces that 
the players can place.

• Suggestion: Maximize number of interactions between pieces.
• Overall goal: Use emergence and orthogonality as tools in 
game design

• Back at 16:20, present.
