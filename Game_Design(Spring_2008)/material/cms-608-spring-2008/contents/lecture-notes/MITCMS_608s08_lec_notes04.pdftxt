Game History and Types of Fun 
 
− 

In the past game history has consisted of lists of game platforms basically 
−  boring! 
−  And then there's this elusive idea of “fun” 
the rules don't actually describe the kind of experience 
− 
there are different types of fun 
− 
−  The developers and players have very different perspectives (like Course 6 vs. CMS!) 
from the system vs. from the aesthetics. 

 
Game history as incremental evolution 
−  Let's examine matching tile games 
looked down upon in the game industry, even in casual games 
− 
−  but so popular! 
−  First came Bejeweled, then lots of clones 
−  Then Jewel Quest – moderate innovation 
−  match on every tile 
−  7 Wonders 
−  pass “cornerstones” through the playing field 
−  Da Vinci Code 
−  clear a path 
−  The family tree is quite complex!  (SEE FAMILY TREE) 
−  There's a limit to how complex/difficult a casual game can get 
the casual game audience has less patience for a steep learning curve or 
− 
complicated instructions 
−  Comparative game history 
−  Same Game vs. Tetris (the two “roots” of match-3 games) 
−  What's still missing from the tree? 
−  3D, competitive, innovations after 2005 
−  How do you determine what came first and what influenced what? 
−  Example: Zuma, Puzzle Loop, Luxor, clones 
−  Developers want to be original, but players think of all games as versions of each 
other 
−  Should games be innovative or familiar? 
−  A mix? 
−  One new thing at a time? 
−  There have been very successful games that were entirely new concepts 
−  Katamari, Sims 
−  EXERCISE: make a game evolution tree 
 
−  Fun vs. system 
−  Does knowing that Tetris is NP-complete tell us anything useful? 
−  What is a game? 

−  The system, the machinery, or the emotions? 
−  The MDA framework doesn't hold for card/board games etc. where the players must 
understand the mechanics first. 
−  Maybe your design goals should be aesthetic? 
−  “I want the game to make the player feel...” 
there are many unpredictable types of fun! 
− 
−  How do you make a player cry? (not through frustration!) 
−  emotional development over time and effort 
−  expectations for emotional involvement
