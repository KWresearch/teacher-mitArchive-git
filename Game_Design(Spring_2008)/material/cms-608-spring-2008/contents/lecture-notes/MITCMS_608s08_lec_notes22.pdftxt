Notes by Clara Rhee 
 
Emergence, cybernetic systems
-  positive/negative feedback 
-  dynamic difficulty adjustment 
-  emergence exercises 
 
Positive and Negative feedback in Cybernetic Systems 
-  a tool to regulate fun and interest in games 
- 
it can happen outside the game rules, just between personalities 
- 
think Monopoly – positive feedback 
-  but the losing players can collude… 
 
DDA
-  Mario Kart 
-  how does the player know about it?  does it feel cheapened? 
- 
the balance of challenge vs. skill 
-  anxiety -> flow channel -> boredom 
-  but maybe the “flow channel” should /\/\/\-> a bit 
-  variable positive reinforcement 
-  does it happen in non-digital games? (not statistically!) 
-  Risk 
 
Two kinds of games 
-  Emergence 
- 
strategy guides 
-  “more than the sum of its parts” 
-  Progression 
-  walkthroughs 
-  “no more than the sum of its parts” 
-  most games these days combine both 
-  originally most adventure games were about progression 
-  now action games (like shooters) are about emergence 
- 
John Conway’s Game of Life – not a game, but emergence 
- 
simple rules, but independent structures 
- 
sometimes emergence breaks the game – they can surprise you! 
- 
if you plan for it, is it emergence? 
-  orthogonal unit differentiation – Harvey Smith 
-  all units should have more than one axis 
-  even in a seemingly simple game system like Katamari, objects have size and 
shape 
-  parameters vs. rules 
- 
is there a clear distinction between them? 
rule changing games 
-  players like changing strategies but not difficulty spikes  
- 
in multiplayer, is an all-over difficuly spike meaningless?
