CMS.608 – 4 March 2008 
Notes by Clara Rhee 
 
-  Learn and play a bunch of existing card games.  (Bridge, Cribbage) 
- 
In Cribbage, the other players’ actions and choices have a different kind of 
impact/reaction then in Bridge 
-  Uncertainty vs. random 
-  Emergent behavior is not necessarily good
