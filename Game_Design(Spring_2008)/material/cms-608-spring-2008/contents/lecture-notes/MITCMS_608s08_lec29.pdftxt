• Social play!

The Magic Circle

• Salen & Zimmerman, “This is Not a Game: Play in Cultural 
Environments” (2003)
• The classical notion of a game implies that there is a clear and
unambiguous border between the game and the world outside 
the game, manifest most clearly in Huizinga's concept of the 
"magic circle." The magic circle of a game is a delineation in 
time and space of the game's existence: the sports match, for 
example, takes place only within the borders of the playfield, 
for a duration that lasts between the starting whistle and the 
final second of play.
• While this model of a game does describe many experiences 
of play, there are many examples of games that purposefully 
blur the border between the world of the game and "real life." 
From live-action role-playing games to games like Majestic or 
Assassin, there is a wide variety of games that intentionally 
blend in with their surrounding cultural environment.

Criticisms of the idea of 
the magic circle
• Thomas Malaby, “Beyond Play: A New Approach to Games”
(2006)
• [...] games thinkers have relied on an exceptionalist approach 
to games, seeing them as a form of play necessarily set apart 
from the everyday, and therefore requiring a distinct 
treatment. In short, this inherited and largely unexamined 
theory of games assumes there is a rupture (in experience, in 
form) between games and other aspects of social life. But 
while understandable, this is precisely the wrong approach. 
• [...] we must work from an approach that: (1) sees them as 
never fully separable from other aspects of experience
• [...] This approach is both consistent with a range of existing 
social theory and avoids many of the limitations that have 
characterized much games scholarship to date, in particular 
its tendency toward unsustainable formalism and 
exceptionalism.

Games and players: Social 
meaning attaches to goals
1. Players play for personal goals
2. They are aware of goals of other players
3. Helping / thwarting goals. Knowing that 
they know that you know etc...

• Shared understanding of goals lets 
players be nice and not-so-nice to 
other players.
• Goals allow in-game actions to be 
attached to social setting.

Three frames in 
Sorry/Parcheesi
You have the opportunity to 
capture. Now what?

1.You want to win - capture!
2.Other player is far behind –
don’t capture.
3.Ongoing competition with 
other player – capture!

Goals are good for 
telling stories
• Tellability (Ryan)

• Bad story: Plan that succeeded.

• Good story: Plan that failed.

• Tellability adds social value.

Exercise (pick one or 
two)
Take existing non-digital game.
1. That only allows hostility (blocking other player’s 
goals) and add the possibility of helpfulness
2. Make game involve social taboos
3. Find way to bring more social content into the 
game
4. Find way to bring more social content out of the 
game
5. Enhance social dynamics like in “Rooie rules”
