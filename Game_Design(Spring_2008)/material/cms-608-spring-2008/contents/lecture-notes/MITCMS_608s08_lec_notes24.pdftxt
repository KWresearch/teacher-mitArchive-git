Notes by Clara Rhee 
 
Bending and Breaking Rules
- 
first, revisit emergence 
-  as many interactions as possible between game elements 
-  designing a system with emergence 
-  examples 
- 
in chess, every piece affects every other piece 
- 
in go, each piece changes the entire board 
- 
surprise is a complicated thing to design into a game 
-  emergence is good for… 
-  allowing replay 
-  creating different experiences

The five different players 
- 
standard, dedicated, unsportsmanlike, cheat, spoil-sport 
-  have you cheated? 
-  cheat codes, stealing money in Monopoly, lying in sport 
-  do you feel like you’re doing something wrong? 
-  depends on the other players 
-  cheating by mistake? 
the transgressive pleasure 
is a cheat code cheating? 
-  depends on the game – single or multiplayer 
-  on your goals 
-  on what the code does 
-  difference between cheat codes and secrets 
-  or is it determined by the releaser of the game? 
-  an “official” wrong way 
-  you can end up skipping the enjoyment 
is it immoral to cheat in multiplayer? 
-  what if everyone is cheating? 
- 
if it’s official? 
-  convention – agreement between players 
is it immoral to cheat in single player? 
- 
is a walkthrough cheating? 
-  Fluxx – a game about changing the rules 
- 
it’s not really changing the rules 
- 
it’s just changing the state of the game 
- 
the things called “rules” 
the Meta-rules don’t change
