Notes by Clara Rhee 
 
Digital Games
-  what did you lean from the robot game exercise? 
- 
it’s hard to create a balanced AI 
- 
it’s hard to make a non-obviously broken game 
-  why do we play games on computers? 
- 
(this is console and computer games) 
-  multifunctional, multiple interfaces 
-  general purpose 
-  adaptable 
-  powerful 
-  what does a computer do? 
-  playing a game of chess vs. writing a good novel 
-  defined rules and goals 
-  writing a novel is an undefined process 
- 
rules are algorithms 
-  what can digital games do that board games can’t? 
-  neutral rule enforcement 
-  multi/single player flexibility 
-  keep track of complex systems 
-  more emergent 
-  not tied to physical reality 
-  why are board games much more abstract than digital games? 
-  processing power allows for more complex systems of fiction 
-  when you understand the system and rules, it’s hard to hold onto the fiction 
-  production values 
-  what can board games do that digital games can’t? 
-  physical, tangible fun 
-  more immediate social interactions 
-  more modifications, cheating, flexibility 
- 
less abstract interface 
-  400 Project 
- 
for game design 
-  Exercise: apply the “400” rules to your game 
- 
it’s useful!  But don’t take it too seriously
