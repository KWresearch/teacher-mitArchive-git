About today
• Game history as incremental evolution
– Exercise
• Game design as MDA. From systems to 
fun

A short history of matching 
tile games

• From brand new to well-
known.

• Q. What kind of games is PopCap
interested in publishing?
A. Not just match-3 puzzle games! 
We’re interested in pushing the 
boundaries of the casual games market 
with a variety of different projects.
(PopCap 2006)

• On the big portals, at any hour, day or 
night, tens or hundreds of thousands of 
players gather to play Hearts, Spades, 
Canasta, chess, backgammon and a 
zillion shareware match-three games. 
(Varney 2006)

Jewel Quest (IWin 2004): 
Moderate innovation
• “Match-Three games 
have done well 
historically and have 
proven to be quite 
addictive. We wanted to 
take a familiar concept 
that people already 
enjoy and raise it to a 
level that is much more 
exciting and engaging 
than it's ever been.

A question of influence

SameGame vs. Tetris: The 
two roots of matching tiles
• Non-timed vs. Timed
• Fallen tiles vs. Falling tiles
• Tile similarity vs. Entire lines
• Obligatory matches vs. Free movement

Zuma (PopCap 2004)
and clones

"It's kind of the 
year of the Zuma
clones," said 
Gwertzman,  …
"Zuma came out in 
2004, and it was 
the #1 best selling 
arcade game on 
Real Arcade for 
that year. We were 
all very excited 
about it, but it's 
2005 and there 
have been a ton of 
very obvious Zuma
clones. There was 
one called Luxor, 
and like five or six 
others. “

Puzz Loop (Mitchell 1998)
and clones

Luxor (Mumbo Jumbo 
2005)

• … asked by the 
moderator about the 
influence of Zuma on 
Luxor, Walker 
hesitated, 
commenting: “Zuma
was certainly a factor.”
After thinking about 
how to integrate the 
basics of Centipede
and Galaga with 
puzzle game 
mechanics, the 
developers worked 
from the core mission 
to have a game 
without negative in-
game actions.

Different versions of a

history

• Developers claim originality.
• Players see games as

http://www.jesperjuul.net/text/swapadjacent/index_image054.jpg
“version of other game”.

Contradictory interests
• Developers want to be (perceived as) 
innovative. (And make money.)

• Players want fun...

• Should games be brand new (modernist 
poem) or familiar (crosswords, puzzles, 
Sudoku)?

Exercise
• Make a history tree of a genre.
• (Card games, sports, video games).
• 15 minutes, present. 3:55 PM

• Make the best history ever written.
• What parameters change?
• Is there a “first” game? Several?
• Where is the genre going?

Tetris is NP-complete
• We prove that in the offline version of Tetris, it is NP-
complete to maximize the number of cleared rows, 
maximize the number of tetrises (quadruples of rows 
simultaneously filled and cleared), minimize the 
maximum height of an occupied square, or maximize 
the number of pieces placed before the game ends.
(Erik D. Demaine, Susan Hohenberger, David Liben-Nowell: „Tetris is Hard, Even to Approximate”, 2002)

• What does and doesn´t this tell us 
about Tetris?

What are games really?
• State machines?
• Complex systems?
• Emotions?
• Stories?
• Graphics?
• Culture?

Mechanics – Dynamics –
Aesthetics framework
• Mechanics: The rules and concepts that formally specify the 
game-as-system.
• Dynamics: The run-time behavior of the game-as-system.
• Aesthetics: The desirable emotional responses evoked by the 
game dynamics.

Aesthetic goals
• I want to make game that makes the player 
feel ...
• Accomplishment? Fantasy?
• How do you plan on making the player feel 
this?
• How do other games accomplish this?
• ”Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal.”
(T.S. Eliot)
