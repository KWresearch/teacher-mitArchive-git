CMS.608 (Lab) – 25 February 2008 
Notes by Clara Rhee 
 
A bit of the history of the classification of Games
-  Callois, French anthropologist, studied games and came up with classification 
systems 
-  Helpful to differentiating game activities with leads to good design 
-  Agon – conflict, competition, not necessarily against other players 
-  Alea – chance, random events 
-  Mimicry – imitation, storytelling, theatre games 
- 
Ilinx – games of “vertigo”, eXtreme sports 
-  And perpendicular to these categories, an axis of Ludus <-> Paidia 
-  Ludus – rules you need to follow to win 
-  Paidia – unregulated manipulation of rules 
-  “There’s a difference whether you shoot the prostitute after sex, or you have 
to shoot the prostitute after sex.” 
-  Examples: 
-  Russian Roulette: Alea, Elinx 
-  D&D: Mimicry, Agon, Alea 
-  Given context, even chess could be Alea.  “grandmaster getting a divorce” 
-  Context affects everything …like how anything can be turned into a drinking game. 
-  Like psyching out your opponent 
-  Trash talking …is that cheating?  Or just playing in the bigger context? 
-  Historically, “railroad games” take into account the context of players (on a train) 
constantly coming and going at uncontrollable times. 
-  Psychology is a big part of how games are played. 
-  How many games of pure Alea are there? 
-  Not that many.  Not even the lottery.  People pick in clusters, like dates, and it 
turns into a game of statistics. 
-  Games of pure chance aren’t really fun. 
-  What’s the appeal of Bingo? 
-  Social “old people hanging out” 
-  Simple 
-  A bit of skill “alertness” 
-  Suspense-and-release “yelling BINGO!” 
-  Creating superstitions 
-  Humans are pattern recognizing machines. 
-  A lot of games hinge on that, whether or not it’s logical. 
-  What is the origin of games of chance? 
-  Soothsaying, fortunetelling, Oracle of Delphi, religion 
-  Decision making, thanks to self-fulfilling prophesies and confirmation biases 
-  Tarot cards etc. separate the decision making from the religion – “privatizing” 
fortunetelling 
-  Fortunetelling is basically storytelling; a Tarot deck is a story generator 
-  Games of chance don’t leave decisions to the players 
-  Predispositions are key 

-  EXERCISE: Build a game on pure chance.  See how fun it is. 
- 
It’s actually pretty boring. 
-  What little fun is there? 
-  Sensory gratification 
-  Personal investment 
-  Suspense build-up 
-  But all these games are broken. 
-  Random is not fun. 
-  Beware of random!  Random is all too easy in videogames. 
-  EXERCISE: Add some choice to your chance game. 
 
-  Final lesson: LESS RANDOM MORE GUNS!
