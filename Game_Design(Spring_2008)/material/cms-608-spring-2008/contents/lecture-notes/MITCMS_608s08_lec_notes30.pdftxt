Notes by Clara Rhee 
 
Puzzle Design
-  why is it we like puzzles so much? 
-  what is a puzzle? 
- 
it’s fun 
- 
there’s a right answer 
-  can’t be too easy/hard 
it’s hard to pinpoint difficulty and enjoyability for different audiences 
the opponent is the puzzle itself, not another player (not quite, with high score records 
etc.) 
- 
it’s a state of affirs 
-  dependent on insight – logical, but witty/surprising etc. 
- 
types of insight (many!) 
-  persistence 
-  no insight 
-  eureka 
- 
the insight is everything 
story 
- 
the insight is part of the problem progression 
-  piecemeal 
- 
little insights 
-  parts of a puzzle 
- 
rules 
-  problem description 
-  not too much, not too little 
-  mystery! 
-  goal 
- 
solution 
types of puzzles (based on materials) 
- 
language, visual, logic, numbers, puzzle games 
-  how to design puzzles?
