April 8: Bending & 
Breaking Rules

Game Design
CMS.608/CMS.864

Jesper Juul

Sorry about that

• Zimmerman/Salen, Rules of Play: 
Ch. 21
• Callois, Man, Play, Games: Ch. 4
• Sniderman and DeKoven, The 
Game Design Reader

Today

• Emergence revisited
• Bending & breaking rules
• Cheating
• Exercise: Add rule changes (and 
perhaps cheating) to your game

Emergence revisited

• How do you create emergence?
• What is it good for?

Bending & Breaking 
rules
• Standard Player
• Dedicated Player
• Unsportsmanlike Player
• The Cheat
• The Spoil-sport

• Who are you? When?

Is a cheat code 
cheating?
• Distinguish between:
– There is an official right way of playing the 
game.
– An official wrong way of playing the game.
– There are also unofficial wrong ways of 
playing the game.

Cheating in multiplayer

• It is immoral to cheat in 
multiplayer?
– Always?
– What is, and what is not cheating? Bots? 
Scripts?
– What are the criteria by which we argue?

Cheating in single player

• Is it immoral to cheat in single 
player?
– Is a walkthrough cheating?
– Is a cheat code?
– Is action replay?

Cheating in single player

• Is it immoral to cheat in single 
player?
– Is a walkthrough cheating?
– Is a cheat code?
– Is action replay?
• Yes: The game is a social 
contract.
• No: The game can be used 
however you like it.

Can you make a game 
about changing the 
rules?

Distinguish 
between
• Meta-rules
• Rules

Changing parameters 
vs. changing rules
• Parameters: Unit X now moves 3 
squares pr. turn
• Rules: The goal is now to end with 
the fewest points.

• No hard distinction between these 
two?

Rules changed by the 
game: An example
• Conclusion
– Players like rule changes that change 
strategies
– But dislike rule changes that cause difficulty 
spikes (in single player)

Do you want to prevent 
or support the breaking 
of rules?
• Prevent for the right reason: The 
game would become less fun.
• Prevent for the wrong reason: I have 
the right to decide how players play.
• Support for the right reason: Give 
players a sense of ownership; more 
content in the box.
• Support for the wrong reason: 
Because it is cool.

Exercise: Changing 
rules in your game 
project
• Make an addition to your design that 
allows players to change rules in the 
game
– “Change rules” as in “players accept that it is called 
‘changing rules’”.
– Test to the extent possible

• Optional: Make a change that makes 
“cheating” an official part of the game
– “Cheating” as in “you call it cheating”.
• Back at 16:25

The use of rule changes 
and cheating
• What does it do?
• Support/prevent?
• Players as co-designers or illusion
of players as co-designers?
• Single vs. multiplayer
