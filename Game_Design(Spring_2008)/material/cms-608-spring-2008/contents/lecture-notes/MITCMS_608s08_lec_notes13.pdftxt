CMS.608 – 6 March 2008 
Notes by Clara Rhee 
 
-  The reading had two bad definitions of “information” 
- 
In the future, don’t use the word “information” …unless you’re trying to deliberately 
confuse 

 
- 
‘Information’ as a measure of uncertainty 
- 
In the Shannon-Weaver model, information is the range of possibilities 
-  So in game design, the perimeter of all moves that the players can make is the 
possibility space 
-  Degrees of freedom, range of choice 
-  One important difference between information and uncertainty is NOISE 
-  Noise is a part of the information that is not controllable by the source 
-  This fits in with the idea of games as purposely inefficient systems 
-  Being unable to clearly communicate in Charades or Pictionary is the point of the 
game 
- 
It can be more fun, or it can be just frustrating 
-  Game state and player knowledge can be obfuscated 
-  A particular signal can mean more than one thing 
-  Can happen in many ways – for example, low sampling rate 
-  Are there games where you’re trying to communicate to some people but not others? 
-  Canadian Fish, Kemps, Bridge, sports signals 
-  There’s misdirection, obfuscation, encoding 
-  Noise cancellation is redundancy is error correction 
-  Are there games with error correction? 
-  Sudoku, Picross, any game with multiple referees, photo-finish for races 
-  Even in video games, if you get shot, there are multiple signals: sound effects, red 
flash, stats drop, other visual effects… 

 
-  Perfect vs. Imperfect knowledge 
-  Most board games have perfect knowledge 
-  Are there card games with perfect knowledge? 
-  Freecell, 
-  Blackjack?  Is the state of the deck knowledge? 
-  Hard to find, because cards are designed for hiding information 
-  There are games with too much knowledge as well as too little knowledge 
-  There are games where the rules are the commodity 
-  Flux, Mao 
-  Computer games can be generally slow to introduce rules, since the rules are hard 
coded in, so the players don’t need to understand every nuance to play 
-  Over the course of play, the range of uncertainty generally decreases 
-  Are there games where uncertainty increases? 
-  Mario Kart? 
-  Strategy games where the effects multiply 

 

Managing information, I mean knowledge, overload 
-  Player memory and player computation power 
-  Many games (especially German computer simulations!) throw a matrix of 
information at you – too much! 
-  But too little information, like a text adventure, can be bad too 
-  Overall, decisions should be easy to make and execute 
-  The data can be obscured (and should be sometimes!) 
 
-  Objective vs. perceived information (warning: bad definition in book!) 
- 
Is perceived information the stuff you the player know and the objective info what’s 
there in the game?
