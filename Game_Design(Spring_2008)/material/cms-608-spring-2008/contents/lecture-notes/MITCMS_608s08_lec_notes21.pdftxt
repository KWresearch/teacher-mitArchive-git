Notes by Clara Rhee 
 
Game Theory
Prisoner’s Dilemma 
-  what is “rational” play? 
-  what is optimal play? 
-  you have to assume that the other player the same decision that you will – that’s one 
line of argument – so stick to your story 
- 
the other line of reasoning says you should minimize your losses – so defect! 
-  “game theory has mostly stuck to economics – it’s marketable! 
-  “it predicts people’s decisions better than probability” 
-  game theory for games works best for games designed for game theory 
- 
let’s talk about some cheesy, annoying winning strategies 
-  a lot of discussion about Super Smash Brothers… 
-  “degenerate strategies” 
-  any game that allows “infinite” cycles of damage 
-  optimal strategies don’t allow for decision making, maybe skill 
- 
so if you have a comprehensive possibility space (which applies to computer games 
too!) but there’s a narrow slice that guarantees a win, it’s a problem 
important when designing AIs 
-  you can’t just take the optimal strategy 
-  “what would a player do?” 
- 
if it’s really an optimal strategy, the game is impossibly hard 
-  otherwise, it can be just too predictable 
-  but players don’t like it when you “let” them win (as in trivially easy) 
- 
it can be fun to lose! 
-  optimal alliances?
