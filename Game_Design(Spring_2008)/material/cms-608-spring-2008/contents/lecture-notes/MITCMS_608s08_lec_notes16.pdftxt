Notes by Clara Rhee 
 
A bit of a recap… 
-  This class takes the historical approach on games 
-  Games began with chance (dice, casting lots, cards) which can be divided into: 
-  Random (which is not fun) 
-  Statistics 

 
Race Games
-  What’s new? 
-  The focus changes to the counter rather than the die 
-  Visual info -> counter; environment -> board 
-  The board comes first! 
-  Designing a space where the game takes place 
-  Very clear in sports, looser in card games 
-  Each object has a rule attached to it 
-  What kind of rules can you enforce on a board? 
-  Number of players 
-  Relation of spaces 
-  Movement of the pieces 
- 
In most of this, we’re thinking in 2D 
-  What’s the starting point of the design of a board game? 
-  Who came up with these games we’ve been playing for hundreds of years? 
-  Oral traditions, iteratively spreading 
-  The rules can be lost and reconstructed, but the boards are left behind to give 
information 
-  Race games are the basis of proprietary games 
-  Traditional vs. proprietary; Evolved vs. invented 
-  How do traditional games survive? 
-  Cultural phenomenon, religion, fads 
-  Ease of access to materials 
-  Thousands of years of tweaking 
-  So how can contemporary designs compete? 
-  Pull elements from old games 
-  Analysis 
-  Layers of fiction 
-  The fictional layer can help you understand the rules 
-  Game of Life and Careers For Girls (played on Tuesday) 
-  Both games are versions of the originals 
-  Representations of life as a single path 
- 
‘Life’ games are found in most cultures 
-  Life games are reassuring – all you have to do is follow very simple rules and 
Professional Success, Happiness and Wealth follows!  Life is winnable!   
-  Are there video life games? 
-  The Sims, Fable 

-  Life games can’t be an exact simulation 
-  What would be the point of playing?  It wouldn’t be fun 
- 
It misses the opportunity to make a statement (see the careers in Careers For Girls) 
-  Diner Dash models the job of a waitress 
-  Legend of Zelda models a boy growing up 
-  By getting weapons and killing things 
-  Complaints 
- 
(A lot about Careers For Girls and stereotypes in games) 
-  The ideologies and assumptions can be very offensive 
- 
In the available options, the way the goals are calculated, which resources are 
easier to obtain 
-  Vicious cycle of media artifacts and ideology 
-  Don’t rely on stereotypes when you’re designing a game! 
-  Playing games are about experimentation, so the ideology should be about change 
 
Choice  
-  Usually only in simulation videogames 
-  Not very present in race games 
-  Less choice is more reassuring in some ways 
-  Current trend is for more choice 
-  But even in videogames, choice is often either obvious or binary
