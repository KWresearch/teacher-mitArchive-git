The following photos are from session #3, where students were introduced to
playtesting. They were given supplies to design and play a board game,
including paper, Play-Doh, chess pieces, toy soldiers, dominos, dice, playing
cards, index cards, Post-It notes, rulers, and markers. In groups of 4-6,
students built a physical representation of the game board, drafted rules, and
played 5-10 rounds before stopping for feedback. Changes were made to improve
game balance, simplify or expand the ruleset, introduce extra features, and
otherwise make the game more fun. Each new iteration of the game was tested for
several rounds; at the end of the session, students presented their game design
to the class, explaining their process and objectives.
