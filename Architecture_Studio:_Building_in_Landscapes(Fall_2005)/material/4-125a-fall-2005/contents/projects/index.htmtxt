One of the projects of the studio this semester was the designing and building
of one-person homeless shelters from recycled materials found in and around MIT
and Cambridge. Working in teams of four or five, the students had five days to
design and build their shelters, each team working with a budget of $50. An
important aspect of the project was to orient students to the need for social
architecture -- architecture that is meant to redress social problems -- and to
make them aware of how much useful material we throw away. Ultimately, the
shelters were to aspire to the quality of a quilt -- something artful and
useful made from recycled materials. Shelters had to be unobtrusive and
portable; fit into a shopping cart or roll on wheels; keep out the elements;
and provide some warmth in winter and ventilation in the summer. Students built
the shelters with the help of Technical Instructor Chris Dewart. All images are

The other projects for the semester included designing a performance space in a
quarry, an individual place, and the final project, a coming together place.
Those projects are shown here from a number of students. All work is courtesy
