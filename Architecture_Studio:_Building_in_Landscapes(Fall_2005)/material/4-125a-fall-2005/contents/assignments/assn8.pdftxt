JOSLIN STUDIO, PROBLEM #8: “A GATHERING PLACE FOR SCHOLARS” 
 
 
Theme for Problem #8:   
 

A 1/4” scale model of your most exciting space within the facility, the one place 
you believe will provide the most memorable experience for a user/guest. The 
boundaries/enclosure of the place must be defined on all sides and include an 
exterior wall. The model must also include scale figures and key furniture pieces 
that suggest the use of the space. Issues will include,  
1)  How well the space works for its intended purpose 
2)  The character of the space for its intended purpose 
3)  The quality of the edges as places of inhabitation and appropriate 
filters between inside and outside. 
Models should be made out of materials easy to form and assemble, which 
provide a graphic code for their material quality. 
 
Each student should discuss with Alan and Marco, the extents of their model 
study before embarking on the project
