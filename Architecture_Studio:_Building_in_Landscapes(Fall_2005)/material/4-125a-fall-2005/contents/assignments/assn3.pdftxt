JOSLIN STUDIO, PROBLEM #3: “A PRIVATE PLACE AMONGST SCHOLARS” 
 
General Studio Theme:   
One of the major forces shaping our world today is the phenomena of rapid 
 
Globalization fueled by 1) political changes in previously closed countries, inviting 
large populations to enter the global economic market, 2) the rapid growth and spread 
of computer technology, allowing for ease of global communication, open access to 
information, and mastery of complex processes by compact organizations and/or 
individuals, and 3) the reorganization of the work force to take advantage of the 
opportunities and challenges these changes produce. Our social, economic and built 
world is likely to be dramatically effected. While a dialogue between regional forces 
and cosmopolitan ideas has traditionally shaped the environment, the slow pace of 
change has kept this interrelationship relatively balanced. Today, however, the speed 
in which ideas travel around the world and influence our daily lives is unprecedented. 
How are these changes to be managed by countries, institutions, business and 
individuals? 

With this in mind, the design projects we will pursue for the remainder of the studio 
will involve an environment for scholars (academics, artists, scientists, business 
leaders, etc…) from around the world to come together for a defined period of time 
to live amongst fellows, study the benefits and concerns of Globalization and share 
ideas with one another and the world beyond. 

The site for this settlement is on the BU Bridge and the Railroad Trestle below it. 

 
 

 
 
 
Scenario for Problems 3 and 4:   
 

Each student shall be responsible for designing a Live /Work environment for a 
selected scholar type or your choosing, and will be directed to a defined 
structural bay of the railroad trestle as a specific site for its placement. While the 
student is free to build on, above and below the existing structure of the Trestle, 
he or she must provide a minimum of a 12’ wide, by 10’ high passageway to run 
through their site for the use of scholars and visitors moving amongst scholar’s 
residences and to and from the common facilities of the settlement, and will 
coordinate its location with students of abutting sites. Each student in the second 
half of the studio will design the common facilities in the upper bridge.  
Program for Problem 3 and 4: 
 
 

While each student may create a program specifically appropriate to the type of 
scholar they have chosen, the general environment should include at least, 
 

 

 

1)  An area for private leisure or socializing with guests 
2)  An area for preparing meals and for dining, alone or with guests 
3)  A main sleeping area with appropriate storage 
4)  A secondary sleeping/storage area for guest or family members 
5)  A private bathing area 
6)  A guest bathroom and a private bathroom 
7)  A study and/or work environment in or separated from living area 
8)  Various outdoor spaces for enjoyment of the surrounding setting 
9)  A meaningful transition area between the pedestrian path and the 
entry to the live work environment 

 
The total area of the interior environment should be approximately 1600 sq. ft. 
 
Schedule and Format for Problem 3: 
 

 

Friday, September 30, during class time, 
 
1) Review Project Description 
2) Review Site Documents and Select Sites for each student 
 
 
3) Visit the Site and sketch impressions 
 
Tuesday, October 4th, work due for individual discussion, in 20 x 30 inch 
PhotoShop format (except block model). 
1)  Brief bullet statements about the nature of your scholar type and their 
desired quality of environment (i.e. Inspirational, contemplative, 
invigorating, etc…). What aspects of the environment will speak to 
the “spirit of globalization”, and what speaks to the specific “spirit of 
the region”? 
2)  Loose but articulate sketches identifying specific site qualities of 
interest to you. 
3)  Written List of Program Areas that identifies each of the spaces to be 
incorporated, including their sizes and important characteristics 
(level of privacy or openness, orientation, proportion, furnishings, 
special equipment, type and location of apertures for light and view, 
desired adjacencies, desired location vertically (floor level), acoustic 
characteristics, relationship to the cardinal points, the river, the 
pedestrian path, etc… 
4)  Loose but articulate Plan and Section sketches of first ideas 
5)  Rough Block Model at 1/8” =1’0” (clay, erasures and/or chipboard) 

Thursday, October 6th, due for individual discussion 
1)  Rough, but articulate sketch model(s) out of chipboard, cardboard, 
thin Plexiglas and balsa wood at 1/8”=1’0” 

 
Friday, October 7th, due for class pin-up 
1)  Updated Ideas/Plan/Section Board from Tuesday 
2)  Updated 1/8” sketch model from Thursday
