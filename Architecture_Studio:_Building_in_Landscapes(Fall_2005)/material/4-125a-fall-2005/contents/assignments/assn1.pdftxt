First Project - “Performance Place in the Quarry” 
 
Assignment 1 “Clues and References” 
 
For this first project you are asked to design a performance place for a 
performer/performers of you choice. The place should be large enough to 
accommodate 30 to 40 people, be covered from sun, rain, wind and connect 
to the quarry. It should be made of simple materials (wood, steel, canvas, 
glass, concrete) and is not an enclosed space but a cover over an area 
designed for enjoying a concert. 
 
We will spend the afternoon at the quarry site on Friday.   
 
During this time you should think about 
 
1. The nature of the site: 
 

•  What does it feel like? 
•  Where did it come from? 
•  How can someone else understand it? 

 
2. The nature of the performance venue 
 

•  Type of Performance and its workings/needs/dimensions 
•  Nature of relationship between audience and performer, 
•  What would the ideal performance place be like 

 
3. The relationship between the two 
 

•  Nature of Relationship between audience/performer and site  

 
By the end of the afternoon, you should have selected a location for your 
design project and photographed/sketched the area so you can bring back 
information to the studio.  You also should bring back a “site clue” that you 
can talk about with the rest of the studio.  Finally, you should start to think 
about the design. 
 
Due for next review on September 15 at 1pm. 
 
1.  One 20”x 30” drawing/board (Board should feel alive and fresh) 
a.  Show the site through photos, sketches, sit clues, and  
b.  Show an attitude about your design.  (This could be a 
Photoshop presentation or done by hand drawings) 
c.  Describe a chosen performer(s)/performance (type) through 
text, sound, found images, sketch, diagram, and/or collage. 

 
2.  Sketch model at 1/8” scale of the area and simple form model of your 
first idea. 

•  What should be its orientation 
•  How does one get there and leave 
•  What do they experience along the way to and from the performance 
•  Where should it be? 

 
 
Assignment 2 –“Making a Design” 
 
On Thursday, September 22, 1pm, there will be a review of the first project.  
For this review there should be the following material to present your ideas. 
Outside reviewers will review the work. 
 
1. Model at 1/4” scale (as detailed as possible) 
2. Complete model of the quarry at 1/4” scale including areas not built on/ to 
be done as a studio group project. 
3.  Two panels (20 x30) to include at least the following 
•  plan and section of your design showing dimensions, space, place, sizes, 
materials  
•  statement of your ideas 
•  small sketches of views  of and from your place (coming upon it, arriving 
at it, and being there in it),
