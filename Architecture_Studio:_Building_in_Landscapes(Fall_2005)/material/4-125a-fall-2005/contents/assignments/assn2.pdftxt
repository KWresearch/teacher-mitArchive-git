SUMMARY OF PROBLEM #2:  
“A PLACE FOR THE HOMELESS” 
 
 
Theme:  

Two serious predicaments, expanding daily, currently plaque our society; 1) the lack 
of affordable housing and protection for those people falling out of the security of our 
economic system, and 2) the overabundance of waste flowing from an economic 
system of disposable consumption. This studio exercise looks to use the second to 
assist the first. Students in groups of 5 or 6 will Design and Build creative solutions 
for the temporary sheltering of those without homes, using standard materials from 
the piles of waste typically discarded daily from MIT and other readily accessible 
local sources, as well as inexpensive new materials of general availability. 
 
The success of the design shall be based on the following criteria, 

Program: 
 

Schedule: 
 

Schedule:  
(cont.) 

 

 

 

 

1)  Size: No larger than 6’x6’x 6’ (height) 
2)  Function: Providing for the inhabitant a secure place to sleep and to 
keep his/her belongings, where protection from the elements can be 
found and/or just simply a “home base” where time can be spent. 
3)  Structure: An ability to withstand the force of storm winds without 
collapse. 
4)  Thermal and Moisture Protection: An ability to keep the inhabitant 
comfortable and dry in a broad range of weather, temperature and 
internal humidity conditions, through waterproofing, insulation, 
heating, and natural ventilation.  
5)  Transport: An ability to easily dismantle, move and reconstruct the 
shelter without the inhabitant having to rely on the use of any outside 
vehicle or physical assistance, other then a shopping cart and their 
own simple construction skill. 
6)  Image: The construct shall transform “junk” into a crafted and 
beautiful shelter that provides dignity to its inhabitants.

Friday, September 23 thru Sunday, September 25 (9pm) 
 
Representatives of the homeless share needs and challenges. 
 
Marco Marraccini to present references of temporary shelters and the 
extraordinary handling of “ordinary materials”. 
 
Chris Dewart presents available “kit of parts”, their characteristics and 
the associated working processes. 

Teams begin “serious” brainstorming of ideas and convert into rough 
sketch model form.  
 
Teams to present rough sketch model, for review and sign-off, to the 
Faculty on Sunday evening (9pm) 
 
Team to assemble a material list and review with Chris Dewart and the 
Faculty to determine source of each material, which studio member shall 
be responsible for the acquisition of each, and within what time frame. 

 
Monday, September 26 through Wednesday, September 28 
 
Materials to be acquired by designated team members, TA’s and Faculty 
on Monday. 
 
Students, within their groups, shall prefabricate the shelter within the 
shop and studio space of N51-N52. 

 
Thursday, September 29 

By 4pm, students are to have transported their shelters in shopping carts 
and erected them in the designated area of the Kresge oval (rain or 
shine). Critics will judge the designs awarding 1st place and runner up 
prizes. 
 
5pm, a Celebration. The work will be open to the public, as well as to 
Representatives from the City of Cambridge Social Services and MIT. 
 
Good luck and Good fun to all.
