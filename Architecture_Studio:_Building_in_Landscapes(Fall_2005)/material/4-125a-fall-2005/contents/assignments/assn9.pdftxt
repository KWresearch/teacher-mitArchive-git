JOSLIN STUDIO, PROBLEM #9: “A GATHERING PLACE FOR SCHOLARS” 
 
Theme for Problem #9: Last Assignment (at last) “Putting it all together”  
 
 
This last work should be an opportunity to design the final project as well as present it in 
a form that others can understand.  The model and drawings should be of presentation 
quality that explains your design clearly.  All work should be on 20 x 30 boards although 
more than one board might be needed to show some material. The presentation should be 
organized so that the total boards are part of a larger idea. 
 
1.  From the first two projects (Quarry and Live-Work) at least two boards for each to 
show the process and product of the work.  All models that best illustrate your 
design.  The model from the last project “Live-Work Environment” should be 
included. 
2.  All work from “Gathering Place for Scholars” including, first boards, models to show 
the process of design. 
3.  Detailed new model at 1/8” showing as much detail as possible of both buildings and 
public space. There should also be enough context to indicate surrounding site. 
4.  Plans of all floors at 1/8” including ground floor exterior space. These drawings 
should be rendered and labeled to show uses as well as form drawn with detail. 
5.  Sections (at least three) through the site at 1/8” showing architecture, structure, space, 
materials and light... (Each section on one board) 
6.  Elevation from the river on the Downtown side (East), rendered to show materials. 
(One board) 
7. 
 The enhanced 1/4” section model showing as much detail as possible.  
8.  A new statement on 20 x 30 board indicating name, attitude, idea, program of your 
project. A short paragraph should be included.  (The paragraph should be done 
several days before to make a program for each of you for review). 
9.  A photomontage of your model on a photo of site. 
10.  One board to show what is the special architectural feature of your project.  The 
method of showing is up to you. 
11.  A 1/16” scale roof plan of the design in context with a larger area of the River and 
the Boston/Cambridge setting.  It should also show the your “Live Work 
Environment). 
12.  Any thing else that you want to show.
