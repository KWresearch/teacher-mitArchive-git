Problem  Set  6:  Davidson  –  The  Logical  Form  of  Action  Sentences 

1.  Which	 of  the  following  criticisms  does  Davidson  deploy  against  rival  accounts  of 
action  sentences? 

(a)  That  they  fail  to  identify  a  logical  form  for  action  sentences  that  could  be  used 
as  the  basis  of  a  theory  of meaning. 
(b)  That  they  fail  to  account  for  logical  inferences  amongst  action  sentences. 
(c)  Both 
(d)  Neither. 

2.  What would Davidson  take  the  logical  form of  ‘Jones buttered  the  toast  in  the bath­
room,  with  a  knife,  at midnight’  to  be? 
(a)	 ∃x(Buttering(Jones, the  Toast, x)) &  ∃x(In(bathroom, x)) &

∃x(With(knife, x)) &  ∃x(At(midnight, x))

(b)	 ∃x(Buttering(Jones, the  Toast, x) &  In(bathroom, x) &

With(knife, x) &  At(midnight, x))

(c)	 ∃x(x  consists  of  the  fact  that  Jones  butter  the  toast  in  the  bathroom,  with  a 
knife,  at midnight) 
(d)  None  of  the  above 

3.  What would Davidson take the  logical form of  ‘Jones buttered the toast deliberately’ 
to  be? 
(a)	 ∃x(Buttering(Jones, the  Toast, x) &  Deliberate(x)) 
(b)	 ∃x(Buttering(Jones, the  Toast, x) &  Deliberate(Jones, x)) 
(c)  It  was  deliberate  of  Jones  that  ∃x(Buttering(Jones, the  Toast, x)) 
(d)  He  explicitly  declines  to  discuss  such  cases. 

4.  On  Davidson’s  analysis,  which	 of  the  following  is  a  logical  consequence  of  ‘Jones 
buttered  the  toast  in  the  bathroom,  with  a  knife,  at midnight’ ? 
(a)	 ∃x(Buttering(Jones, the  Toast, x)) 
(b)	 ∃x(In(bathroom, x) & With(knife, x) &  At(midnight, x)) 
(c)  Both 
(d)  Neither
