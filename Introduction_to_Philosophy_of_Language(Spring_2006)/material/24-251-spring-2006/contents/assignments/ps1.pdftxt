5.  Grice  claims  that  there  is  no  ‘reﬂective  paradox’  in  saying  ‘A  uttered  x  with  the 
intention  of  inducing  a  belief  by  means  of  the  recognition  of  this  intention’.  Why 
not?  (There  is  risk  of  reﬂective  paradox  when  an  intention  is  about  itself.) 

(a)  Because  the  speaker needn’t be aware of  the mental processes behind her utter­
ance. 
(b)  Because  it  is  not  a  foregone  conclusion  that  the  belief  will  be  induced  in  the 
audience  whether  or  not  the  intention  behind  the  utterance  is  recognized. 
(c)  Because  the  problematic  phrase  can  be  paraphrased  as  “A  intends  to  induce  a 
belief  in  her  audience, A  intends  her  utterance  to  be  recognized  as  so  intended, 
and  A  intends  this  recognition  to  play  a  part  in  inducing  the  belief.” 
(d)  Because  some  utterances  shouldn’t  be  classiﬁed  as  informative.
