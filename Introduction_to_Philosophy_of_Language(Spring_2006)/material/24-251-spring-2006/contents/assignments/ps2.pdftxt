24.251  –  Intro  to  the  Philosophy  of  Language 
Problem  Set  2:  Grice  on  Implicature 

1.  I’m  at  a  restaurant  and  I  (truthfully)  say  to  the  server  ‘my  fork  fell  to  the  ground’, 
implicating  that  I  would  like  my  fork  replaced.  According  to  Grice,  what  sort  of 
conversational  implicature  is most  likely  to  have  taken  place? 

(a)  One  in  which  the  second maxim  of  quality  is  violated. 
(b)  One  in  which  exploitation  takes  place. 
(c)  One  in  which  it’s  not  clear  that  any maxim  is  violated. 
(d)  None  of  the  above. 

I  (truthfully)  respond  ‘Professor  X  is 
2.  A  friend  asks  me  why  I  dropped  the  class.	
not  the most  engaging  of  lecturers.’  According  to Grice,  what  sort  of  conversational 
implicature  is most  likely  to  have  taken  place? 

(a)  One  in  which  a maxim  of  relation  is  violated. 
(b)  One  in  which  the  second maxim  of  quantity  is  violated. 
(c)  Conversational  implcature  didn’t  take  place  at  all;  this  is  a  case  of meiosis,  and 
hence  of  conventional  implicature. 
(d)  None  of  the  above. 

3.  ‘One should try to refrain from spitting when one speaks’.  What sort of maxim would 
Grice  take  this  to  be? 

(a)  A maxim  of manner. 
(b)  A maxim “sepcially connected with the particular purposes that talk is adapted 
to  serve  and  is  primarily  employed  to  serve”. 
(c)  Not,  at  any  rate,  a  conversational maxim. 
(d)  None  of  the  above. 

4.  Which  of  the  following  is  true  according  to Grice? 

(a)  A conversation in which participants strongly disagree is a conversation in which 
the  Cooperative  Principle must  be  violated  to  a  certain  degree. 
(b)  Whenever one ﬂouts a conversational maxim one thereby ﬂouts the Cooperative 
Principle. 
(c)  Although  the  Cooperative  Principle  can  sometimes  be  satisﬁed  even  though  a 
conversational maxim is ﬂouted, it can never be satisﬁed in cases of exploitation.

(d)  None  of  the  above. 

5.  Which  of  the  following  is  true  according  to Grice? 

(a)  One  can’t  speak obscurely without  thereby violating  the Cooperative Principle. 
(b)  Implicatures  can  sometimes  be  cancelled. 
(c)  In  general,  conversational  implicatures  take  place when,  though  some maxim  is 
violated  at  the  level  of  what  is  said,  the  hearer  is  entitled  to  assume  that  the 
maxim,  or  at  least  the  overall  Cooperative  Principle,  is  observed  at  the  level  of 
what  is  implicated. 
(d)  None  of  the  above.
