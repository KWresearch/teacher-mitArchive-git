24.251  –  Intro  to  the  Philosophy  of  Language 
Problem  Set  4:  Tarski  on  Truth 

1.  Which  of  the  following  is  an  appropriate  instance  of  Tarski’s  schema  (T): 

(a)  ‘grass  is  green’  is  true  if  and  only  if  grass  is  green 
(b)  grass  is  green  is  true  if  and  only  if  grass  is  green 
(c)  grass  is  green  is  true  if  and  only  if  ‘grass  is  green’ 
(d)  X  is  true  if  and  only  if  p 

2.  Suppose	 one’s  ob ject  language  L  consisted  entirely  of  the  two  sentences  ‘snow  is 
white’  and  ‘grass  is  green’,  and  suppose  one  gave  the  following deﬁnition of  truth  for 
L: 

For  any  sentence  s,  s  is  true  if  and  only  if  [it  is  either  the  case  that  (s  = 
‘snow is white’ and snow is white) or it is the case that (s = ‘grass is green’ 
and  grass  is  green)] 

Which  of  the  following  would  be  true,  according  to  Tarski: 

(a)  One’s  deﬁnition  of  truth  is materially  adequate 
(b)  One’s  deﬁnition	 makes  no  appeal  to  undeﬁned  semantic  terms  (cf.  the  ﬁrst 
paragraph  of  p.  343). 
(c)  Both 
(d)  Neither 

3.  Let	 L  be  deﬁned  as  above.  Why,  according  to  Tarski,  shouldn’t  one  expect  the 
antinomy  of  the  Liar  to  be  derivable  in  L. 

(a)  Because  the  usual  laws  of  logic  don’t  apply. 
(b)  Because  L  isn’t  semantically  closed. 
(c)  One  can  derive  the  antinomy  of  the  Liar  in  L. 
(d)  None  of  the  above. 
4.  Consider  a  language,  L� ,  built  up  from  the  predicate  ‘. . . is  true’  and  the  names  on 
the  following  list: 
•	 c0  (which  refers  to  the  English  sentence  ‘snow  is  white’) 
•	 c1  (which  refers  to  the  L�  sentence  ‘c0  is  true’) 

1 

•	 c2  (which  refers  to  the  L�  sentence  ‘c1  is  true’) 
•	 c3  (which  refers  to  the  L�  sentence  ‘c2  is  true’)

.
. . 
•	 cn+1  (which  refers  to  the  L�  sentence  ‘cn  is  true’)

.
. . 
Sentences  in  L�  are  formed  in  the  usual  way: 
• 
’ 
‘ci  is  true 
is  a  sentence 
for  any  i,
•	
if  φ  is  a  sentence,  then  ‘ it  is  not  the  case  that  φ is  a  sentence 
’ 
•	 if  φ  and  ψ  are  sentences,  then  ‘(φ  and  ψ)
’ 
is  a  sentence 
•	 nothing  else  is  a  sentence 
Finally,  we  stipulate  that  the  ordinary  laws  of  logic  are  to  hold  for  L� . 
Can  the  antinomy  of  the  Liar  be  derived  in  L�? 

(a)  Yes. 
(b)  No. 

(Hint:  This  is  a  non­trivial  question.  In  answering  it,  make  sure  you  read  the  dis­
cussion  on  p.  340,  and  footnote  11.)
