24.251  –  Intro  to  the  Philosophy  of  Language 
Problem  Set  5:  Davidson  –  Truth  and Meaning 

1.  Why  does  Davidson  think  that  a  theory  of  meaning  must  yield  the  result  that  the 
meaning  of  the  whole  depends  on  the meanings  of  the  parts? 

(a)  Otherwise  one  couldn’t  explain  how  we  learn  language. 
(b)  Such  is  the  basic  principle  that  Frege  laid  down. 
(c)  Otherwise  there  is  a  risk  of  inﬁnite  regress. 
(d)  Davidson  argues  AGAINST  the  claim  that  the  meaning  of  the  whole  depends 
on  the meanings  of  the  parts. 

2.  Which  of  the  following  does  Davidson  take  to  be  part  of  a  theory  of meaning: 

(a)  Ascertaining  the  logical  form  of  sentences  in  the  language  under  study. 
(b)  Supplying  a  dictionary  for  the  language  under  study. 
(c)  Determining  which  entity  is  the  meaning  of  each  word  in  the  language  under 
study. 
(d)  Eliminating  ambiguous  words  from  the  language  under  study. 

3.  How,  according  to  Davidson,  might  one  motivate  the  thought  that  meaning  cannot 
be  identiﬁed  with  reference? 

(a)  Otherwise one would get the result that any two false sentences are synonymous. 
(b)  It  is  required  by  the  view  that meanings  are  not  entities. 
(c)  Otherwise  one  wouldn’t  be  following  Frege’s  footsteps. 
(d)  Otherwise  one  wouldn’t  get  the  result  that  the  meaning  of  the  whole  depends 
on  the meanings  of  the  parts 

4.  What is Davidson’s main complaint against a theory of meaning which assigns entities 
as meanings? 

(a)  The  entities  play  no  explanatory  role. 
(b)  The  entities  would  be mysterious  from  a metaphysical  point  of  view. 
(c)  Use  of  the  entities  would  clash  with  the  pro ject  of  getting  the  meaning  of  the 
whole  to  depend  on  the meanings  of  the  parts. 
(d)  The  entities  are  ruled  out  by  the  logical  form  of  certain  sentences. 

5.  According  to Davidson’s  proposal, which  of  the  following  is  a  constraint  on  a  theory 
of meaning? 

1 

(a)  That  it  yield  suitable  instances  of  schema  (T). 
(b)  That  it  yield  a  dictionary  for  the  language. 
(c)  That  it  settle  ambiguities. 
(d)  No  suitable  constraints  have  yet  been  given  by  linguists. 

6.  Why  does  Davidson  think  that  sentences  involving  belief­attributions  cause  trouble 
for  the meaning­theorist. 

(a)  Because  it  isn’t  clear  what  their  logical  form  is. 
(b)  Because  ‘believes’  is  a  vague  term. 
(c)  Because  belief  attributions  cannot  be  formulated  in  the  propositional  calculus. 
(d)  Because  there  is  a  tight  interconnection  between  belief  and  truth:	 we  do  not 
know  what  someone  means  unless  we  know  what  she  believes,  and  we  do  not 
know  what  someone  believes  unless  we  know  what  she means 

7.  According  to  Davidson,	 why  is  it  easier  to  give  a  meaning  theory  for  one’s  own 
language  than  it  is  to  give  a meaning  theory  for  an  alien  tongue? 

(a)  Because  when  it  comes  to  an  alien  tongue  it  is  hard  to  be  sure  whether  the 
sentences  on  either  side  of  the  relevant  instances  of  schema  (T)  have  the  same 
truth­value. 
(b)  Because  an  alien  tongue may  contain  untranslatable  concepts. 
(c)  Because  of  constraints  imposed  by  the  principle  of  charity. 
(d)  Because meanings  aren’t mind­independent  ob jects,  as  Frege  took  them  to  be.
