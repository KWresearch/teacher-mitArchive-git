24.251  –  Intro  to  the  Philosophy  of  Language 
Problem  Set  8:  Quine  on  Radical  Interpretation 

1.  Which  of  the  following  is  distinctive  of  radical  translation,  according  to Quine? 

(a)  All  one  has  to  go  on  is  forces  impinging  on  the  native’s  surfaces,  the  native’s 
observable  behavior  and  cultural  similarities. 
(b)  All one has to go on  is  forces  impinging on the native’s surfaces and the native’s 
observable  behavior. 
(c)  No  individual  interprers  are  available,  only  chains  of  interpreters. 
(d)  The  native  language  corresponds  to  a  primitive  culture. 

2.  When  Quine  explains	 (on  page  32)  what  it  is  for  a  stimulation  to  belong  to  the 
‘aﬃrmative  stimulus meaning’  of  a  sentence  for  a  given  speaker, why  is  the  auxiliary 
stimulation  σ �  needed? 

(a)  to avoid the result that the stimulations typically caused by an elephant passing 
by  on  its  own  belong  to  the  aﬃrmative  stimulus meaning  of  ‘Lo,  a  rabbit’. 
(b)  to avoid the result that the stimulations typically caused by a fake rabbit belong 
to  the  aﬃrmative  stimulus meaning  of  ‘Lo,  a  rabbit’. 
(c)  to  avoid  the  result  that  the  stimulations  typically  caused  by  a  passing  rabbit 
belong  to  the  aﬃrmative  stimulus meaning  of  ‘2+2 =  4’. 
(d)  to  avoid  the  result  that  the  stimulations  typically  caused  by  a  passing  rabbit 
belong  to  the  aﬃrmative  stimulus meaning  of  ‘Lo,  a  rabbit’. 

3.  According to Quine, the sentence  ‘Lo, a unicorn’ and the sentence  ‘Lo, a goblin’ have 
the  same  stimulus­meaning. 

(a)  true 
(b)  false 

4.  According  to  Quine,	 which  of  the  following  is  a  reason  for  thinking  that  radical 
interpreters ought to focus on stimulation patterns, rather than ob jects in the world? 

(a)  Because  of  possible  cultural  diﬀerences  between  speakers. 
(b)  Because	 one  would  expect  the  same  linguistic  dispositions  if  the  world  were 
diﬀerent  but  stimulations  were  the  same. 
(c)  Because  total  ocular  irradiation  patterns  that  diﬀer  in  centering  also  diﬀer  in 
limits.

(d)  Because  diﬀerent  speakers might  have  diﬀerent  beliefs  about  the  world. 

5.  What,	 according  to  Quine,  is  the  diﬀerence  between  an  occasion  sentence  and  an 
observation  sentence? 

(a)  The stimulus­meaning of observational sentences  is more closely  linked to forces 
impinging  on  the  natives  surfaces. 
(b)  Whereas observationality depends on  insensitivity  to  collateral  information,  oc­
casionality  does  not. 
(c)  ‘Elephants  are  gray’  is  naturally  thought  of  as  an  occasion  sentence  but  not  an 
observational  sentence. 
(d)  ‘Elephants are gray’  is naturally  though of as an observational  sentence but not 
an  occasion  sentence. 

6.  According  to  Quine,  why  does  ‘Lo,  a  rabbit’  have  a  higher  degree  of  empirical  ade­
quacy  as  a  translation  of  ‘Gavagai’  than  ‘Lo,  an  undettached  rabbit  part’ ? 

(a)  Because  ‘Lo,  a  rabbit’  is  the  simpler  hypothesis. 
(b)  Because ‘Lo, a rabbit’ is more naturally thought of as an occasion sentence than 
‘Lo,  an  undettached  rabbit  part’. 
(c)  Because  ‘Something  is a rabbit  if and only  if  it  is a  fusion of undettached rabbit 
parts’  is  naturally  thought  of  as  stimulus­analytic. 
(d)  Quine  does  not  think  that  ‘Lo,  a  rabbit’  has  a  higher  degree  of  empirical  ade­
quacy. 

7.  On page 71, Quine claims that, when one considers the case of a bilingual translator, 
(1)  can  be  extended  to  (1� ).  Why  is  this? 

(a)  Because  a  bilingual  translator  is  in  a  position  to  assess  questions  of  stimulus­
synnonimy between a non­observational occasion sentence and a candidate trans­
lation. 
(b)  Because  the  enterprise  of  radical  interpretation  relies  essentially  on  the  framing 
of  analytical  hypotheses. 
(c)  For  the  reason  explained  in  the  ﬁrst  paragraph  of  page  69. 
(d)  None  of  the  above. 

8.  Quine believes that it is in principle possible to come up with incompatible analytical 
hypotheses  for  translating  the  utterances  of  speakers  of  one’s  own  language. 

(a)  true 
(b)  false
