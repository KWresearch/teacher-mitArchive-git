24.251  –  Intro  to  the  Philosophy  of  Language 
Problem  Set  7:  The  Foster  Problem 

1.  What,  according  to  Foster,  is  the  problem  with  the  original  version  of  Davidson’s 
proposal? 

(a)  Davidson has no good way of dealing with belief sentences and other intensional 
contexts. 
(b)  Davidson gives us no way of actually ﬁguring out which sentences of the language 
under  consideration  are  true. 
(c)  A  Davidsonian  theory  of  meaning  might  be  consistent  with  many  diﬀerent  in­
terpretations  of  the  language  under  consideration. 
(d)  None  of  the  above. 

2.  What,  according  to  Foster,  is  the  problem  with  the  revised  version  of  Davidson’s 
proposal? 

(a)  Davidsonian  considerations  of  charity  are misapplied. 
(b)  Davidson  has  not  been  able  to  formulate  a  theory  that  doesn’t  appeal  to  inten­
tional  idioms  and  states  something  knowledge  of which  is  suﬃcient  to  interpret 
the  language. 
(c)  There  is  a  disparity  between  the  weakness  of  what  T­sentences  state  and  the 
constraints  on  their  construction. 
(d)  None  of  the  above. 

3.  How  does  Foster  think  the  problems  he  raises  ought  to  be  addressed? 

(a)  By  renouncing  considerations  of  Charity. 
(b)  By  requiring  a  theory  of  meaning  to  state  not  just  what  it  takes  for  a  sentence 
to  be  true,  given  the  way  the  world  actually  is,  but  also  what  it  would  take  for 
a  sentence  to  be  true  had  the  world  been  otherwise. 
(c)  By  taking  the meaning  of  a  sentence  to  be  a  possible  world. 
(d)  None  of  the  above.
