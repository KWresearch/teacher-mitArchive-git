24.251  –  Intro  to  the  Philosophy  of  Language 
Problem  Set  3:  Davidson  on  Theories  of Meaning  and  Learnable 
Languages 

1.  On the ﬁrst page of ‘Theories of Meaning and Learnable Languages’, Davidson claims 
that ‘it must be possible to give a constructive account of the meaning of the sentences 
in  [a  learnable]  language.’  What  is meant  by  ‘constructive’  here? 

(a)  That  the  account  not  be  under  the  grip  of  an  empiricist  epistemology. 
(b)  That  it be possible to specify what every sentence  in the  language means on the 
basis  of  purely  formal  considerations. 
(c)  That  the  account  be  free  from  the  distinction  between  sense  and  reference. 
(d)  None  of  the  above. 

2.  Davidson  thinks  that  a  diﬃculty  arises  in  attempting  to  capture  the  account  of  quo­
tation  suggested  by  Tarski  in  the  passage  quoted  on  page  10  as  part  of  a  theory  of 
meaning.  Why  is  this? 

(a)  Because a language with inﬁnitely many semantic primitives would not be learn­
able. 
(b)  Because  Tarsi’s  account  does  not  provide  even  the  kernel  of  a  theory. 
(c)  Because  we  must  give  up  the  idea  that  quotations  are  syntactically  composite 
expressions. 
(d)  None  of  the  above. 

3.  On page 7, Davidson claims, that thinking of a language ‘as an organic whole’ imposes 
constraints  on  the  sorts  of  languages  that  are  learnable.  Why  is  this? 

(a)  Because  it  imposes  constraints  on  the  sorts  of  languages  there  could  be. 
(b)  Because part of a language cannot be fully learned unless the entire the language 
is  partly  learned. 
(c)  Because an entire language cannot be partly learned unless a part of the language 
is  fully  learned. 
(d)  None  of  the  above. 

4.  Which  of  the  following  is  true  according  to  Davidson? 

(a)  A  theory  of  language  acquisition  should  be  careful  to  abide  by  the  constraints 
of  an  empiricist  epistemology.

(b)  It  must  be  possible  to  extract  a  truth  deﬁnition  from  any  adequate  theory  of 
meaning. 
(c)  Unless  a  language  could  have  inﬁnitely  many  semantic  primitives,  it  would  be 
impossible  to  have  languages  containing  inﬁnitely many  sentences. 
(d)  None  of  the  above.
