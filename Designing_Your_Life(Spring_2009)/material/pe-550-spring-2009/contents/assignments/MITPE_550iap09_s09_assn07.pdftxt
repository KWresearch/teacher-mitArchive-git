Homework 7: Cleaning Up Hauntings 

1. Continue making and keeping promises, reporting in every Sunday. Report on 
whether you kept or did not keep your promises. Suggested format: 

a.  Describe the promise 

b.  Write for each promise “KEPT” or “NOT KEPT” 
c.  Describe the consequence 

d.  Write if you paid the consequence or not. IF no, by when will you pay 
it? 

e.  What are your stats on keeping the promise (e.g. I kept 5/7 days). 
f.  What did you notice about yourself? Where did you stop yourself? 
Where were you a chicken or brat, and where were you great? You can 
include this for any promise, but ALWAYS do this for every promise 
that was NOT KEPT. 

2.	 Pick one haunting and analyze it 

a.	 Make a list of all the information you don’t have about the haunting, 
such as “I don’t know what he really thought about it,” “I am missing 
whole parts to what happened,” (when, who, what everyone really 
said—you probably only remember segments). 

b.	 What experience does this haunting represent? Being betrayed, being 
lied to? 

c. 	 How could this have happened to you? Why weren’t you able to 
prevent it? 

d.	 What was your role in it? Remember that you probably weren’t as 
naïve as you claim you were. 

e.	 Are you scared of resolving and cleaning it up? Why? Make a list of 
why. 

f.	

If you were to clean up this haunting what would you say and ask, and 
to whom? 

g.	 What is the lesson, trait, theme, or pattern to be learned from this 
haunting?
