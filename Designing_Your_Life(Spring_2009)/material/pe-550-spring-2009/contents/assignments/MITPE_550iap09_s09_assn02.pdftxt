Designing Your Life (IAP-Spring 2009)  

Lauren Zander and Gabriella Jordan  

Homework 2: Theories 

1. Continue making and keeping promises, reporting in every Sunday. Report on 
whether you kept or did not keep your promises. Suggested format: 

a.  Describe the promise 

b.  Write for each promise “KEPT” or “NOT KEPT” 
c.  Describe the consequence 

d.  Write if you paid the consequence or not. IF no, by when will you pay 
it? 

e.  What are your stats on keeping the promise (e.g. I kept 5/7 days). 
f.  What did you notice about yourself? Where did you stop yourself? 
Where were you a chicken or brat, and where were you great? You can 
include this for any promise, but ALWAYS do this for every promise 
that was NOT KEPT. 

2.	 Beat the Mind Game. Play a sport with yourself.  Pick one area of life, and 
take one action that rocks your world in that area. This action should directly 
challenge one of your theories. For example: 

a.	 If you have the theory that it’s hard to eat healthily, plan a day of 
perfect eating. 

b.	 If you have the theory that people don’t care about strangers, go to a 
park and ask people for help. 

c. 	

If you have a theory that you friends don’t want to hear your truth, 
design a beautiful conversation with them in which you share your 
truth. 

3.	 Watch your thoughts as you do this inspired action. Look at your thoughts 
before, during, and after the action. Show yourself that you can prove a 
different theory.
