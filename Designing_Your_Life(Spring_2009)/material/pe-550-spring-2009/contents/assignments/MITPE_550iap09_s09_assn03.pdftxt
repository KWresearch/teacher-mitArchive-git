Homework 3: Theories, Purges, and Thought Logs 

1.	 Continue making and keeping promises, reporting in every Sunday. Report on 
whether you kept or did not keep your promises. Suggested format: 
b.	 Describe the promise 
c. 	 Write for each promise “KEPT” or “NOT KEPT” 
d.	 Describe the consequence 
e.	 Write if you paid the consequence or not. IF no, by when will you pay 
it? 
f.	 What are your stats on keeping the promise (e.g. I kept 5/7 days). 
g.	 What did you notice about yourself? Where did you stop yourself? 
Where were you a chicken or brat, and where were you great? You can 
include this for any promise, but ALWAYS do this for every promise 
that was NOT KEPT. 

2.	 Thought logs. Three times per day, stop and write down the thoughts you 
were having over the past hour or two. It’s a good idea to set a timer, such as 
on your cell phone, to remind you when it’s time to record your thoughts. 
Write down as many thoughts as you can remember, but make it light and 
quick. Give yourself a time limit, such as 5 minutes, and challenge yourself to 
write as many thoughts in that time as possible. Don’t edit your thoughts; 
just literally dump whatever is in your brain on the page. Do this for 2 weeks. 
Some of your thoughts are embarrassing, and you won’t want to share them 
with us. But the things you hide own you, and become truth. So the key is to 
have a sense of humor about it. Isn’t this cute/funny that I keep thinking this 
thought? Ha!
