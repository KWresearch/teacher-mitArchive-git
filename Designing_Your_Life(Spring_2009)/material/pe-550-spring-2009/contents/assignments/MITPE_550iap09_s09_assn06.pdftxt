Homework 6: Haunting Incidents 

1. Continue making and keeping promises, reporting in every Sunday. Report on 
whether you kept or did not keep your promises. Suggested format: 

a.  Describe the promise 

b.  Write for each promise “KEPT” or “NOT KEPT” 
c.  Describe the consequence 

d.  Write if you paid the consequence or not. IF no, by when will you pay 
it? 

e.  What are your stats on keeping the promise (e.g. I kept 5/7 days). 
f.  What did you notice about yourself? Where did you stop yourself? 
Where were you a chicken or brat, and where were you great? You can 
include this for any promise, but ALWAYS do this for every promise 
that was NOT KEPT. 
2.	 Write out the incidents from your life that haunt you. Include everything you 
have ever done that you don’t want people to know about. Look for main, 
sharp incidents and events that have shaped you. They are very specific 
memories; for example, when I think of X, what immediately comes to mind 
is Y. Be sure to cover all the important topics of your life (mother, father, 
family members, relationships, sex, job incidents, money, career, break-ups, 
childhood dramas and fears). You can revisit the 18 areas to jog your 
memory. Dig deep— there should be at least 15 incidents on your list. Each 
haunting should have at least a 3-sentence description, and it should be clear 
to the reader what the incident was. 
3.	 Week 1—Identify another trait you want to take down, such as “Judgmental” 

a.	 Which parent does it come from? 

b.	 Describe their version of it. 

c. 	

Identify 2 different styles of the trait in you, ways that it 
manifests/shows up. For example,  

i.	
ii.	

I am judgmental when I watch and say nothing  
I am judgmental when I do say something 

4.	 Week 2—Catch the trait and have some insights about it (getting the 
character/personality understood) [NOTE – RULE—DO NOT FEEL BAD ABOUT 
IT—get a sense of humor about it, have fun, laugh at it, love it.]
