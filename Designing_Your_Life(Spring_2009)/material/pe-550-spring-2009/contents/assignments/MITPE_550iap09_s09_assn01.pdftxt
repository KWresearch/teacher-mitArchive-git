Designing Your Life (IAP-Spring 2009)  

Lauren Zander and Gabriella Jordan  

Homework 1: Promises and Consequences and Areas of Life 

1.	 Design a set of promises and consequences for three of your 18 areas of life. 
These promises should get you closer to your dream in each area. Email us 
the promises and consequences by tomorrow night, and send us the results of 
the week’s promises and promises for the coming week to us by Sunday. 
Report on whether you kept or did not keep your promises. Suggested 
format: 
a.  Describe the promise 

b.  Write for each promise “KEPT” or “NOT KEPT” 
c.  Describe the consequence 

d.  Write if you paid the consequence or not. IF no, by when will you pay 
it? 

e.  What are your stats on keeping the promise (e.g. I kept 5/7 days). 

f.  What did you notice about yourself? Where did you stop yourself? 
Where were you a chicken or brat, and where were you great? You can 
include this for any promise, but ALWAYS do this for every promise 
that was NOT KEPT.
