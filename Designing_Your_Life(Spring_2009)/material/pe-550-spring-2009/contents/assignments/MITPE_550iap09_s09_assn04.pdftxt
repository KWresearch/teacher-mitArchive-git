Lauren Zander and Gabriella Jordan  

Homework 4: Excuses 

1. Continue making and keeping promises, reporting in every Sunday. Report on 
whether you kept or did not keep your promises. Suggested format: 

a.  Describe the promise 

b.  Write for each promise “KEPT” or “NOT KEPT” 
c.  Describe the consequence 

d.  Write if you paid the consequence or not. IF no, by when will you pay 
it? 

e.  What are your stats on keeping the promise (e.g. I kept 5/7 days). 
f.  What did you notice about yourself? Where did you stop yourself? 
Where were you a chicken or brat, and where were you great? You can 
include this for any promise, but ALWAYS do this for every promise 
that was NOT KEPT. 

2. Go back to your 18 areas of life, and for the ones that were below an 8, find 
the excuses in there. For each one, 
a.	 Explain why it is an excuse 
b.	 Identify the chicken or the brat. What are you using that excuse for? 
Why keep it around? 
c. 	 Describe what being in integrity would mean to you in that part of your 
life.
