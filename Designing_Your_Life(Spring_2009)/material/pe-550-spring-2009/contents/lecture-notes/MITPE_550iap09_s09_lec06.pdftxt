Lecture/Discussion 6: Haunting Incidents 
 
 

Principle: Hauntings 
Hauntings are memories that stay with us for many many years. They hold the key to the 
patterns of us; they are lessons that are ready to be learned. They have common 
characteristics: 
1.  It is one-sided story that really is two-sided. But have you really been checking 
in with the other people involved? You are talking with the other person in your 
head, not with your mouth. If you are talking to someone in your head, then you 
have a haunting. You are making up lies about the way the other person would 
respond, because you don’t know. 
2.  There is a victim/martyr side of the story. Why did you put up with it? 
To find a haunting, look for things that you cannot shake. A dream, an ambition that you 
haven’t made good on, something that someone said to you, or something that you said (or 
didn’t say).  Stuff you are taking to the grave. Embarassing moments, something 
uncomfortable, something that makes you angry. 

Oftentimes we have our story about why this memory bothers us. “It’s because my mom 
was such an unfair witch!” But we don’t have the real reason why it bothers us. It bothers 
us because there is something about ourselves that we need to learn from in this incident. 
To begin unraveling, ask yourself if there was: 
1.  Jealousy/envy 
2.  You trying to get out of trouble. 
3.  You trying to look good to others. You lose yourself. 
For example, Lauren was often screwed over by her girlfriends. At first she was like “how 
could this happen to me? Poor me.” But then she asked herself why she chose those 
friends. How was it that she was so talented to pick so many of the same type? Her lesson 
was that she needed to learn how to have integrity in relationships. To not ignore her 
friends being mean to other people and turning a blind eye, but to stand up for what is 
right. To not seek out the adoration of others to the exclusion of seeing them for who they 
really are. Why does she need the adoration? Why is that the most important quality to her? 
Why play make-believe about who these people are? 

Our work is to connect the dots on these incidents and see what it says about you. See 
what these say about you.  
As we discussed in lecture 2, you can choose what you want to prove in your life, and prove 
it. But the problem comes when you insist on believing that people are a certain way. If you 
believe that people treat you unfairly, you will meet nothing but unfair people. Until you 
recognize that it is your theory, you will continue to prove it. The hauntings show you what 
theories you are proving. 

Oftentimes the thing that bothers us about other people is some trait that we have as well. 
See what you are attracting. Do you want to attract something different?  
 
Class Participation 

Participant 1: I am haunted that when I was 13, I predicted that this one girl would be the 
first of our friends to get pregnant. Someone told her, and she got mad. But lo and behold, 
she was the first.  

Lauren: So then you need to clear this up with the friend who told, and the girl who got 
pregnant.  

Participant 1: But I can’t tell her that. Her life is so complicated, she’s married now, I don’t 
want to rock the boat (and a bunch of other excuses).  

Lauren: See the fear. Underlying this story is a pattern about you. This haunting is part of a 
larger picture about you. Go back and have the conversations with people, and things will 
starting to shift. What we are pushing up against is a pattern of you. You will start to see 
what this pattern is. This is not a big deal. It’s a cute little kid story. What are you so afraid 
of? There is something that you have hidden that becomes reality. It has become a theory. 
The point of going after the hauntings is to find your bad theories. Your life lesson is to 
solve the bad theories and become the hero in your life. 

Lauren: We could psychoanalyze you and find out why you feel the way you do. But action 
(in the form of a confession) is really a testable hypothesis. Confess, and see if things shift. 
This is easy. Just do it. So this is a really great approach toward shifting your life: you don’t 
necessarily have to understand all the pieces, or go that deep, in order to effect real 
change. 
 
 
Homework 
1.  Continue making and keeping promises, reporting in every Sunday. Report on 
whether you kept or did not keep your promises. Suggested format: 
a.  Describe the promise 
b.  Write for each promise “KEPT” or “NOT KEPT” 
c.  Describe the consequence 
d.  Write if you paid the consequence or not. IF no, by when will you pay it? 
e.  What are your stats on keeping the promise (e.g. I kept 5/7 days). 
f.  What did you notice about yourself? Where did you stop yourself? Where were 
you a chicken or brat, and where were you great? You can include this for any 
promise, but ALWAYS do this for every promise that was NOT KEPT. 
2.  Write out the incidents from your life that haunt you. Include everything you have 
ever done that you don’t want people to know about. Look for main, sharp incidents 
and events that have shaped you. They are very specific memories; for example, 
when I think of X, what immediately comes to mind is Y. Be sure to cover all the 
important topics of your life (mother, father, family members, relationships, sex, job 
incidents, money, career, break-ups, childhood dramas and fears). You can revisit 
the 18 areas to jog your memory. Dig deep— there should be at least 15 incidents 
on your list. Each haunting should have at least a 3-sentence description, and it 
should be clear to the reader what the incident was. 

 
3.  Week 1—Identify another trait you want to take down, such as “Judgmental” 
a.  Which parent does it come from? 
b.  Describe their version of it.

c.  Identify 2 different styles of the trait in you, ways that it manifests/shows up. 
For example,  
i.  I am judgmental when I watch and say nothing  
ii.  I am judgmental when I do say something 
 
4.  Week 2—Catch the trait and have some insights about it (getting the 
character/personality understood) [NOTE – RULE—DO NOT FEEL BAD ABOUT IT—get 
a sense of humor about it, have fun, laugh at it, love it.]
