Lecture/Discussion 2: Theories 

New rule: no being late. $1 for every minute you are late to class, or $1 for each day your 
homework is late. This helps you build the muscle of your integrity. 

Principle: Theories 
Theories are ideas about the way the world works. For example: 
o 
If you are nice to someone, they will be nice back to you. 
o  Sex dies after marriage. 
o 
If I don’t lose a few pounds, no one will find me attractive. 
There is no “absolute” truth in our theories, only conjecture. Our theories are usually 
unconscious, and we don’t realize we have them. We see the world through our theory, and 
it colors everything we see. Everything we do, everything we see as possible or impossible, 
justified or not justified, comes from our theories. Theories come from your life experiences, 
your parents, your family, your friends, and the culture in which you live. 
Theories can live a long time, even when counter-evidence for the theory presents itself. 
This is because we are continually gathering evidence to reinforce our theories. We focus on 
examples that support our theory, and interpret events that happen to us in such a way 
that they support the theory. For example, you may have the theory that “there are no 
good single men at MIT.” Unbeknownst to you, you then look for “flaws” in every man you 
meet. And you will be right! With this theory, you will find only flawed men. 
Additionally, by believing in a theory, we make it real, because our thoughts really do 
influence reality. For example, say that you have a theory that your coworker Joe doesn’t 
like you. You notice every time he doesn’t say “good morning” to you. Or every time he 
doesn’t invite you to a meeting or outing. Each one of these events reinforces your theory. 
You get angry with Joe, and you treat him like he doesn’t like you. Pretty soon, regardless 
of if he really did like you or not, he’s not going to like you. 

Theories can be detrimental when you form them without regard to your dreams. Some 
theories are aligned with your dreams (positive theories), and some are not (negative 
theories). 
Example of positive theory: I am invincible. 

Example of negative theory: No one cares what I have to say. 

Theories can be especially damaging in a relationship. We make a mental model of how 
someone is, and interact with that model instead of with the person himself. It is far simpler 
to interact with the model than the actual complicated person. 
One of the secrets to changing your life is to find negative theories and reauthor them. 
Remember that there is no absolute truth in theories, so you can pick the theory that you 
want to be your truth. We all are in the business of proving our theories, so pick the one 
you want to prove, and live your life as proof that that theory is valid. For example, prove 
the theory that sex gets hotter the longer you are married to someone. 

To elicit change in your life, you: 

1.	 Find the negative theories. You prove what you believe. If you don’t have the 
career of your dreams, you don’t believe you can have the career of your 
dreams. 

Example: “I can’t figure out what I really want to do” is a theory. If you hold on 
to it, you will never find what you really want to do. 

Example: “I am afraid of elevators” is a theory. To fix this, you have to admit 
that you made this theory. You need to come to terms with the fact that you 
might have been deliberately crazy your whole life. So many of us just keep the 
theory. 
2.	 Create new theories. This is a fun game. Play. The reason we don’t want to make 
new theories is that things will change. And we don’t want to change. Think 
about how much fun it would be to make your own rules. 

Example: If I need an answer to a question, I write it down and put it by my 
pillow, and I’ll have the answer the next day. And guess what? It’s always 
worked. 
Example: If I catch a negative thought, it will help my career. 

Example: “The DMV is no fun” is a theory. The bulk of our lives is spent doing 
things like going to the DMV. How do you want to relate to it? You really could 
enjoy cleaning the bathroom. 
3.	 Prove the new theory by gathering data. 
4.	 Make good weekly promises to implement your new theory (see next lecture). 

The truth is, we are often reluctant to change our theories, because they are comfortable, 
and a new theory might mean that we then have to do something that scares us or that we 
don’t want to do it. It’s so much easier to not figure it out, and keep the old, safe theory. 

Class participation 

Examples of theories you have 

Participant 1: “My husband doesn’t care.” I keep it because I don’t want to admit my role in 
our relationship, and be guilty for how things are. I don’t want to have to fess up my 
ickiness. 

Participant 2: “My ex-advisor was horrible.” Now that I am in someone else’s lab, we have a 
great relationship. I am realizing that I might have had a role. But I DID tell him how I felt, 
and he just didn’t get it. So I left. 

Lauren: This seems suspicious. It sounds like you are having a relationship with him in your 
head. But you didn’t resolve it. You told him X, he heard Y, and then you walked away. We 
repeat this stuff until we learn what we need to learn. In this case, you need to learn how to 
communicate with authority figures. Fix it now, and you’ll avoid problems in the future. 

Example from the homework: This participant had all of the answers in his homework, but 
worded his answers in such a way that he didn’t need to own them. “I worry that I don’t 
have enough time, and I waste time on junk websites. My parents don’t really have issues 
with time, but my father would flop on the couch and watch mindless TV after work, and my 
mom was stressed about her schedule.” Huh? He sounds exactly like them. But he’s not 
owning them.

Lauren: We could really prove any theory we want. But that means we would have to give 
up things that we like but aren’t good for us. You have a theory “Cupcakes are better than 
apples.” But that is really a theory. There is nothing inherently true about that.  You could 
also believe “Apples are better than cupcakes.” 

Participant 3: I am doing well with food, but sometimes I have lapses. I don’t have 100% 
control over my food. 

Lauren: Can you hear that theory? “I don’t have 100% control over my food.” What a 
convenient theory for allowing those lapses you want. You will feel better when you stop 
having lapses. Write a theory without lapses (note: we also argue in support of theories that 
demonstrate our powerlessness). 

Lauren: When relationships change, odds are because you are now doing something 
differently. You stopped communicating. You stopped calling every day. Many of us have a 
theory “After 3 years of marriage, things start to go downhill…” and so of course our 
marriage problems aren’t your problem if you have that theory. 

Participant 4: I want to run a marathon, but I have theories that it will kill my knees, my 
Achilles tendon is weak, and my shin splints will come back. 

Lauren: You are betting against yourself. You need to decide between “I will run a 
marathon” and “My body won’t let me run a marathon.” If you stay somewhere in between, 
you will mess up your body. You will go for the marathon, but your body won’t let you. 

Participant 5: I want to be more organized in my physical universe. But it’s hard. I am lost 
in the fog. I am lazy. 

Lauren: You are the fog. And you have a theory that you are lazy. You can prove any theory 
you want. You are not fixed lazy. That is not a truth. You are just in the business of proving 
that you are lazy. 

Homework 
1.	 Continue making and keeping promises, reporting in every Sunday. Report on 
whether you kept or did not keep your promises. Suggested format: 

a.  Describe the promise 

b.  Write for each promise “KEPT” or “NOT KEPT” 
c.  Describe the consequence 

d.  Write if you paid the consequence or not. IF no, by when will you pay it? 
e.  What are your stats on keeping the promise (e.g. I kept 5/7 days). 

f.  What did you notice about yourself? Where did you stop yourself? Where were 
you a chicken or brat, and where were you great? You can include this for any 
promise, but ALWAYS do this for every promise that was NOT KEPT. 

2.	 Beat the Mind Game. Play a sport with yourself.  Pick one area of life, and take one 
action that rocks your world in that area. This action should directly challenge one of 
your theories. For example:

a.	 If you have the theory that it’s hard to eat healthily, plan a day of perfect 
eating. 
b.	 If you have the theory that people don’t care about strangers, go to a park 
and ask people for help. 
If you have a theory that you friends don’t want to hear your truth, design a 
beautiful conversation with them in which you share your truth. 

c. 	

3.	 Watch your thoughts as you do this inspired action. Look at your thoughts before, 
during, and after the action. Show yourself that you can prove a different theory. 
Come back and share the results with us.
