SESÂ TOPICS                                                    LECTUREÂ NOTES
       **** Promises and consequences, areas of life ****
1      We learn how to develop your personal integrity by making (PDF)
       and keeping weekly promises to yourself.
       **** Theories ****
       We identify theories you have about the way the world
2      works, and discuss how they impact what you see as        (PDF)
       possible and impossible. We learn how to author new
       theories that better align with our dreams.
       **** Theories, purges, and thought logs ****
       We hunt for theories by recording our thoughts throughout
3      the day. We also learn how to rid, or purge, the mind of  (PDF)
       destructive thoughts that keep us from honoring our
       promises to ourselves.
       **** Excuses ****
       Every time your life does not resemble your dream life,
4      there is likely an excuse that takes the responsibility   (PDF)
       for being great off your shoulders. We learn how to
       identify and debunk the excuses that are holding us back.
       **** Parent traits ****
       Many of our personal traits are formed in reaction to our
5      parents. In this lecture we study this concept more       (PDF)
       deeply, and identify how our parents' traits live within
       us.
       **** Haunting incidents ****
6      Incidents from our past that haunt us contain valuable    (PDF)
       clues to lessons we need to learn. In this lecture we
       learn how to find haunting incidents in our lives.
       **** Cleaning up haunting incidents ****
7      We learn how to clean up and resolve hauntings so they do (PDF)
       not haunt us anymore, and so we can feel proud and
       confident in our skin.
       **** Connecting haunting incidents, traits, and theories
       ****
8      We explain how hauntings arise from our traits and        (PDF)
       theories, and as such can provide valuable insights on
       what we need to evolve to reach our goals.
