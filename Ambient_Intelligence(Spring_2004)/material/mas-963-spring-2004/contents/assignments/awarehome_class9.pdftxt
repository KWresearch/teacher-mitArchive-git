Purpose

- Address challenges facing the future of domestic technologies

Georgia Tech Broadband Institute Residential Laboratory

- Functions as a living laboratory for interdisciplinary design 
development and evaluation.

Research agendas

-Design for people:
design interactive experiences appropriate for people in an 
aware home environment

-Technology: 
develop the building blocks to create highly distributed 
sensing and perception technology

-Software Engineering:
address the software construction challenges of engineering 
a robust and reliable bridge between the designer’s intent for 
interactive experience and the technology itself 
-Social Implications: 
explore the social, political, legal and economic benefits and 
concerns related to privacy and autonomy 

Design for People

-Social communication:
(cid:31)Digital Family Portrait: 
reconnects geographically distant extended family 
members by allowing them to remain aware of each other 
in a non-obtrusive 

(cid:31)Dude’s Magic Box: 
provides a means for grandchildren to share artifacts from 
their world with their grandparents. The grandchild 
participates by placing objects in a box which takes a 
picture of its contents and then forwards that image to the 
grandparents. 

-Memory Aids:
(cid:31)Cook’s Collage: 
Focus on people’s short term memory by how to assist 
users in resuming interrupted activities.

-Everyday home assistants:
(cid:31)gesture pendant: 
recognizes and then translates gestures in to commands 
for your home appliances.

Technology

-Indoor Location Service:
(cid:31)integrate a variety of technologies throughout the home 
space, which range from relatively simple and robust low-
resolution strategies, such as RFID, to more sophisticated 
and higher resolution, state-of-the-art computer vision 
solutions.

-Activity Recognition:
(cid:31)This awareness includes low-level tasks such as reading a 
newspaper or watching TV, and higher-level tasks such as 
preparing a meal, or using a blood glucose monitor. 

Software Engineering

- Context aware computing:
(cid:31)It is a challenge to simplify how the information gleaned 
from a variety of sensors is made available to application 
developers.

-Context Toolkit:
(cid:31)consists of context widgets and a distributed infrastructure 
that hosts the widgets. 

- encapsulation of sensors 
- access to context data through a network API 
- abstraction of context data through interpreters 
- sharing of context data through a distributed infrastructure 
- storage of context data, including history 
- basic access control for privacy protection 

- Automated Capture of Live Experiences:
(cid:31)develop generic support to assist in building applications 
that involve capturing live experiences and making them 
available for later access.

Social Implications

- Assessing Context-Aware Services:
(cid:31)assess privacy concerns raised by the collection of the data, 
the information produced and the dissemination of that 
information to other people in other times and places
