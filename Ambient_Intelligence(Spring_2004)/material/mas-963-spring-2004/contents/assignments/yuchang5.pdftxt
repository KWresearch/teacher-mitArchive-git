for Reflection

Structure of the paper

• develop a design philosophy for slow technology, 
• discuss general design principles and to revisit some 
basic issues in interaction design
• Examples: soniture and informative art

Slow technology is

A design agenda for technology aimed at reflection and 
moments of mental rest rather than efficiency in performance

Analogs between fast and slow technology

• Fast : ease to use, fast learning efficiency, immediate “visible”
results, etc.  (cid:198) take away time

• Slow : i) learn how it works,
ii) understand why it works the way it works, 
iii) apply it, 
iv) see what it is, and 
v) find out the consequences of using it.

The key issues of slow technology

• we should use slowness in learning, understanding and 
presence to give people time to think and reflect. 
• Using such an object should not be time consuming but 
time productive
• get time for new reflective activities and doing new things.

The purposes of slow technology

•
•

•

It differs in calm technology and ambient media. 
It’s not supposed to reduce cognitive load or make digital 
information and computational resources more readily 
available. 
It’s about exposing technology in a way that encourages 
people to reflect and think about it.

Three aspects of slow technology

• Reflective technology ---
i) invites reflection, ii) reflective in its expression

• Time technology ---
amplifies the presence not the absence of time

• Amplified environments ---
uses computers and other technologies of existing 
artifacts.

The principles of slow technology

• Make something more than just a silent tool for fast 
access to something else.
• The amplification is not just a matter of aesthetical 
surface, but concerns the whole thing as it is used
• Don’t talk about functionality and design, but about the 
complete expression of a thing as it appears in the given 
context.

The guidelines of slow technology

• Slow technology is to use simplicity in material in 
combination with complexity of form

• Focus on slowness of appearance and presence (Form)
• Focus on aesthetics of material and use simple basic tools of 
modern technology (Material)

Conclusion

•

Interaction design can also be concerned with the design 
of an environment in which these tasks occur.
• Slow technology is an attempt to revisit some basic 
problems in interface design from a perspective that 
bears on ideas about environmental design.
• Slow technology is not “used” at all but is a part of the 
environment.
