Ubiquitous Computing” CACM 07-93
(cid:132) “Disappearing technologies” are 
most profound ones
– Eg writing: is ubiquitous, does not 
require active attention, ready for use at 
a glance

Information Technology is not 
(yet) a “disappearing 
technology”
– Computer remains in world of its 
own, not integrated in environment
– Approachable only through 
complex jargon that has nothing to 
do with tasks being used for 
– Not just UI issue, also hardware 
form

What does it mean for a 
technology to “disappear”?

(cid:132) Not (just) consequence of technology
(cid:132) But of human psychology
– When people learn something 
sufficiently well, they cease to be aware 
of it, they can focus beyond the 
technology on their (true) goals/tasks
– Called “compiling” by H. Simon, or 
“periphery” by J. Seely Brown

Ubiquitous computing 
constitutes a reversal of some 
other HCI trends
(cid:132) Ubiquitous computing does not mean:
– Computers that can be carried 
everywhere (info accessible everywhere) *
– Multi-media computers (using more 
sensors/output modalities)
– Virtual reality (create a world inside the 
computer, rather than enhance the real 
world with computer data)
– “Intimate” computers such as agents *
– Computers one can talk to (that have 
Common sense)

Weiser’s waves of computing

How do technologies 
disappear into the 
background?

(cid:132) Example: electric motors becoming 
cheaper
– From one motor/workshop to one 
motor/tool
– Current car has 22 separate motors
(cid:132) Many current-day computers are 
already invisible, proliferation of 
devices is taking place

Xerox Parc Experiments in 
Ubiquitous Computing (88-94)

(cid:132) Focus on devices that transmit & 
display information
(cid:132) Two important issues: 
– Location (UC’s must know where they 
are so they can adapt their behavior) 
– Scale (different scales needed to suit 
different tasks): tabs (post-it), pads 
(paper) and boards
- Typical room: hundred tabs, 10-20 pads, 1-2 
boards, all inter-connected

Some TAB examples
(cid:132) Pressure sensitive screen, 3 buttons, 
location-aware, IR receiver
(cid:132) Challenges: size, weight, power
(cid:132) Some applications: 
– Used as active badges for people or 
objects
– Tabs as extensions of computer screens 
(to make programs/file portable to 
another machine)

Some PAD examples
(cid:132) Notebook-sized device, pen for 
writing
(cid:132) Differ from conventional portable 
computers: intended as “scrap 
computers”; no individualized 
identity or importance; spread many 
around the desk, in drawers, etc
(cid:132) Increase desk size of current 
computers (to multiple Pads)
(cid:132) Applications can move from pad to 
pad *

Some BOARD examples
(cid:132) Number of purposes: video screen, 
bulletin board, white board, flip chart, 
electronic bookcase (download 
things onto a PAD)
(cid:132) “Liveboard”: works with wireless, 
electronic “chalk”, is interactive
– permits collaboration at a distance
– Also used as personalized bulletin 
boards (if user wears active badge)
=> resulted in commercial electronic 
whiteboards

Applications of Tabs, Pads & 
Boards explored at Parc
(cid:132) Location-awareness of people & 
things
– Automated call forwarding based on location of 
people
– Automatic login to computers
– Automatic diaries (eg meeting)
– Map of activity in building and where individual 
people are
– Locating objects
(cid:132) Collaboration among people
– Shared drawing using board or pad (pen, 
multiple users, multiple pages, gesture 
recognition, etc)

Power of Ubiquitous 
Computing

(cid:132) Does not come from any one 
device but from interaction of all 
of them
(cid:132) Also from fact that tabs can 
animate inert objects
– Beep to locate misplaced book
– Audience feedback & participation

Technological Challenges in 
Ubiquitous computing

(cid:132) Cheap, small, low-power computers
(cid:132) Wireless & ad-hoc networking ***
(cid:132) Software for ubiquitous applications ***
– New operating systems
– Applications that can move
– New interaction paradigms

*** Hardest challenges

Scenario
Sal awakens: she smells coffee. A few minutes ago her alarm clock, alerted by her restless rolling before waking, 
had quietly asked "coffee?", and she had mumbled "yes." "Yes" and "no" are the only words it knows. 
Sal looks out her windows at her neighborhood. Sunlight and a fence are visible through one, but through others 
she sees electronic trails that have been kept for her of neighbors coming and going during the early 
morning. Privacy conventions and practical data rates prevent displaying video footage, but time markers 
and electronic tracks on the neighborhood map let Sal feel cozy in her street. 
Glancing at the windows to her kids' rooms she can see that they got up 15 and 20 minutes ago and are already in 
the kitchen. Noticing that she is up, they start making more noise. 
At breakfast Sal reads the news. She still prefers the paper form, as do most people. She spots an interesting 
quote from a columnist in the business section. She wipes her pen over the newspaper's name, date, 
section, and page number and then circles the quote. The pen sends a message to the paper, which 
transmits the quote to her office. 
Electronic mail arrives from the company that made her garage door opener. She lost the instruction manual, and 
asked them for help. They have sent her a new manual, and also something unexpected -- a way to find the 
old one. According to the note, she can press a code into the opener and the missing manual will find itself. 
In the garage, she tracks a beeping noise to where the oil-stained manual had fallen behind some boxes. 
Sure enough, there is the tiny tab the manufacturer had affixed in the cover to try to avoid E-mail requests 
like her own. 
On the way to work Sal glances in the foreview mirror to check the traffic. She spots a slowdown ahead, and also 
notices on a side street the telltale green in the foreview of a food shop, and a new one at that. She decides 
to take the next exit and get a cup of coffee while avoiding the jam. 
Once Sal arrives at work, the foreview helps her to quickly find a parking spot. As she walks into the building the 
machines in her office prepare to log her in, but don't complete the sequence until she actually enters her 
office. On her way, she stops by the offices of four or five colleagues to exchange greetings and news. 

Scenario (cont.)
Sal glances out her windows: a grey day in silicon valley, 75 percent humidity and 40 percent chance of afternoon 
showers; meanwhile, it has been a quiet morning at the East Coast office. Usually the activity indicator shows at 
least one spontaneous urgent meeting by now. She chooses not to shift the window on the home office back three 
hours -- too much chance of being caught by surprise. But she knows others who do, usually people who never get 
a call from the East but just want to feel involved. 
The telltale by the door that Sal programmed her first day on the job is blinking: fresh coffee. She heads for the coffee 
machine. 
Coming back to her office, Sal picks up a tab and "waves" it to her friend Joe in the design group, with whom she is 
sharing a virtual office for a few weeks. They have a joint assignment on her latest project. Virtual office sharing 
can take many forms--in this case the two have given each other access to their location detectors and to each 
other's screen contents and location. Sal chooses to keep miniature versions of all Joe's tabs and pads in view and 
3-dimensionally correct in a little suite of tabs in the back corner of her desk. She can't see what anything says, but 
she feels more in touch with his work when noticing the displays change out of the corner of her eye, and she can 
easily enlarge anything if necessary. 
A blank tab on Sal's desk beeps, and displays the word "Joe" on it. She picks it up and gestures with it towards her 
liveboard. Joe wants to discuss a document with her, and now it shows up on the wall as she hears Joe's voice: 
"I've been wrestling with this third paragraph all morning and it still has the wrong tone. Would you mind reading it?" 
"No problem." 
Sitting back and reading the paragraph, Sal wants to point to a word. She gestures again with the "Joe" tab onto a 
nearby pad, and then uses the stylus to circle the word she wants: 
"I think it's this term 'ubiquitous'. Its just not in common enough use, and makes the whole thing sound a little formal. Can 
we rephrase the sentence to get rid of it?" 
"I'll try that. Say, by the way Sal, did you ever hear from Mary Hausdorf?" 
"No. Who's that?" 
"You remember, she was at the meeting last week. She told me she was going to get in touch with you." 
Sal doesn't remember Mary, but she does vaguely remember the meeting. She quickly starts a search for meetings in 
the past two weeks with more than 6 people not previously in meetings with her, and finds the one. The attendees' 
names pop up, and she sees Mary. As is common in meetings, Mary made some biographical information about 
herself available to the other attendees, and Sal sees some common background. She'll just send Mary a note and 
see what's up. Sal is glad Mary did not make the biography available only during the time of the meeting, as many 
people do... 

Hard Issues

(cid:132) Privacy (e.g. one rogue tab recording 
things)
– Decentralisation of data (eg location of 
person stored on that person’s machine)
– Encryption
(cid:132) Access, visibility & control
(cid:132) Ubicomp requires difficult integration 
of human factors, computer science, 
engineering and social sciences to 
create new kind of relationship of 
people to computers

Pros of Ubiquitous 
Computing
(cid:132) UC does not pose barrier to personal 
interactions
(cid:132) UC makes computer “get out of the 
way”, direct interaction with domain
(cid:132) Obtaining info on things is trivial
(cid:132) Everything is easier/faster to do
(cid:132) Will improve computer access
(cid:132) Helps overcome information overload 
problem (machine fits human 
environment, info available at 
fingertips)

State of Ubiquitous 
Computing (10 yrs)
(cid:132) Lots of labs focused on Ubicomp
(cid:132) Conferences: 
– Ubicomp
– Mobiquitous
– Pervasive Computing
– …
(cid:132) Journals: 
– IEEE Pervasive Computing journal
– Springer Personal & Ubiquitous 
computing journal
– …

State of Ubiquitous 
Computing

(cid:132) Paper “Charting Past, Present and Future 
Research in Ubiquitous Computing, ACM 
transactions on CHI, Vol 7, #1, ’00 provides 
good overview
– Natural interfaces
– Context-awareness
– Capture & access

State of Ubiquitous 
Computing
(cid:132) Evaluation
– Lots of predictions came true:
- Proliferation of devices (cell phone, PDA, 
laptop, desktop, …)
- Electronic Whiteboards
- [Pen Pads]
– But current technology is far from 
“invisible” and one device is still used for 
many functions; radical change in HCI has 
NOT happened yet
– A lot of Ubicomp research is not true to 
Weiser’s vision (eg wearables, speech IO)

Limits of Ubiquitous 
Computing
(cid:132) The current computer is: 
– Generic
– Adaptive
– Programmable (extensible)
– A tool for  modeling/simulation 
(cid:132) Space 
(cid:132) Cost
(cid:132) …

Will UC become the dominant HCI metaphor 
(by 2010 acc. to Weiser)?
