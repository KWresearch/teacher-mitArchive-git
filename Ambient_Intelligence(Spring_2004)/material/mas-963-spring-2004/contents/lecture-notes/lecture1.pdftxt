MAS 963 - Ambient Intelligence

Pattie Maes

Ambient Intelligence: Vision

(cid:132) Ambient Intelligence envisions a world where people 
are surrounded by intelligent and intuitive interfaces 
embedded in the everyday objects around them. 
These interfaces recognize and respond to the 
presence and behavior of an individual in a 
personalized and relevant way. 

Merging of different bodies of work

(cid:132) Ubiquitous Computing
(cid:132) Intelligent Interfaces
(cid:132) Context-aware Computing

Some Scenarios

(cid:132) Ambient semantics (H. Liu) 
“enriching your every day experience”
(cid:132) Book tells you about friends/famous people that read/loved it
(cid:132) Book tells you about particularly interesting passages
(cid:132) Touching 2 books makes their connections appear
(cid:132) Objects with memory
(cid:132) Readwear/writewear
(cid:132) Objects that can tell you their relevant stories
(cid:132) Augmented physical environments
(cid:132) Walking around town, system points out buildings/places of 
particular interest to a user (based on user’s interests)
(cid:132) Books on a bookshelf can “speak out” to you (or posters in infinite 
corridor)

Vision (continued)

(cid:132) Ambient Intelligence Technology is:
(cid:132) Invisible:
(cid:132) Use/functions are immediately apparent
(cid:132) Ubiquitous:
(cid:132) Available anywhere, integrated in physical environment 
& objects around us
(cid:132) Intelligent:
(cid:132) Relevant to user & context-aware
(cid:132) Unobtrusive
(cid:132) Providing meaning (vs. knowledge vs. information)

Vision (continued)

(cid:132) Radically rethink the human-computer interactive 
experience:
(cid:132) Integrate digital world (information & services) and physical 
world (physical objects/environment)
(cid:132) Make interfaces more responsive and proactive (objects & 
environment monitor user and (proactively) present 
information & services relevant to user’s current 
needs/interests)

Challenges

(cid:132) Augment objects/environments with sensing, 
computing & networking capability
(cid:132) Sense & model the user’s behavior (offline/online) 
(cid:132) Infer the user’s current interests/intentions
(cid:132) Design (proactive) interfaces that offer value without 
being obnoxious, while being highly relevant
(cid:132) Integrate these interfaces in user’s physical 
environment in seamless, natural way:              
(cid:132) On the body: cell phones, wearables
(cid:132) In the environment: architecture, ether, objects

Goals for this Course

(cid:132) Provide an overview of this new vision for HCI
(cid:132) Read and discuss the most relevant articles in related areas: 
Smart Environments, Smart Networked Objects, Augmented & 
Mixed Realities, Ubiquitous Computing, Pervasive Computing, 
Tangible Computing, Intelligent Interfaces and Wearable
Computing. 
(cid:132) Focus on understanding enabling technologies and studying 
applications and experiments. To a lesser extend address the
socio-cultural impact. 
(cid:132) Come up with new ideas, start innovative projects in this area

How does this class differ from related 
Media Lab classes?

(cid:132) Hiroshi Ishii’s “Tangible Interfaces”
(cid:132) Giving physical form to digital information so that it 
becomes more easily manipulable and perceivable
(cid:132) Joe Paradiso’s “Sensor Technologies for Interactive 
Environments”
(cid:132) Focus on sensor technologies (& performance/events)
(cid:132) Ted Selker’s “, Context-Aware Computing”
(cid:132) Focus on context-aware systems in general (desktop as 
well as ubiquitous systems)

Requirements for the students

(cid:132) Students are required to participate extensively in literature 
research and discussions
(cid:132) Read required readings ahead of class & prepare questions & 
interesting points for discussion
(cid:132) Review & present +- 3 papers in class (from  2/25 on, see ***)
(cid:132) Write 1 short “scenario(s)” paper (by 3/10)
(cid:132) Suggest additional papers to read
(cid:132) Suggest experiments & technologies to look at
(cid:132) Students are required to design and implement an
original project in this area and describe their project in a 3-
page paper as well as make a presentation to the class (5/12)
(cid:132) Limited to 18 graduate students based on their interests and 
backgrounds. Fill out an application by 2/5 at the latest. 
Notification of acceptance by 2/6.

Some of my work in this area

(cid:132) Software Agents Group (till 2001):
(cid:132) Remembrance agent
(cid:132) Periscope
(cid:132) Impulse
(cid:132) Hanging Messages
(cid:132) Interactive Experience Group (ongoing, since 
2003):
(cid:132) What would they think?
(cid:132) Ether Threads
(cid:132) Ambient Semantics
(cid:132) Automated annotation of photographs 

Remembrance agent (on Wearable) 
– Bradley Rhodes (2001)

Context-
specific 
reminders of 
previous notes 
taken
(based on 
location, day, 
time of day, 
other people 
present, 
conversation 
topics, …)

Periscope: A virtual Browser for the 
Real World – Jim Youll (2001)

Camera with compass 
and range finder shows 
webpages about the location 
the user is focused on.

(currently being implemented 
on mobile phone with GPS & 
possibly compass by Dan 
Relihan)

Entities in the Physical Vicinity - Joan 
Morris & Jim Youll (2000)

Ether Threads 
- Brad Lassey (2003)

(cid:132) Infrastructure for annotating the physical world 
(leaving location-specific messages) 
(cid:132) Threads and filtering mechanisms
(cid:132) Can be used as personal or collective 
“distributed memory”

Blue-tooth and GPS 
data trigger location-
based messages 
relevant to the user & 
thread s/he is 
interested in

Automated Annotation of 
Photographs (Relihan, 2004)

Phone Camera 
communicates with 
GPS device via 
bluetooth to record 
location of picture 
taken. Phone 
interfaces to 
www.metacarta.com to 
find urls about that 
location. Extracts and 
offers keywords for 
the picture taken (to 
be edited by the user).

Ambient semantics (Liu & Maes, 2004)

(cid:132) User wears RFID reader on 
wrist (watch/bracelet)
(cid:132) Every object that user picks 
up gets read (without 
requiring user’s attention)
(cid:132) “meaningful” knowledge is 
presented on nearby display 
(eg cell phone) (based on last 
object read, history of objects read, 
personal profile of user)

Impact

(cid:132) Always-present, pro-active, highly responsive 
interfaces make people more efficient, better 
informed.    Examples: 
(cid:132) Better memory (environment/objects around us “remember”
and recall information)
(cid:132) More effective learning (just-in-time information is 
presented when user is most motivated to learn)
(cid:132) Traditional computer interface disappears (replaced 
by augmented bodies & augmented environments)

To Do’s Next Two Weeks

(cid:132) By tomorrow: return class form
(cid:132) By next week (2/11):
(cid:132) Read Ishii and Fraunhofer paper and prepare 
questions
(cid:132) Decide which topic(s)/papers you want to 
research & present & email selection to Pattie
(cid:132) By 2/18: Read “Beating some Common Sense…” by 
Lieberman & Co and prepare questions
