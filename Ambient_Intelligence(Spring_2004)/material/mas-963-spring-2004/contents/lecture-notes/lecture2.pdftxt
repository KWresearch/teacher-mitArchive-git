Mark Weiser at Xerox PARC presented his vision of “Ubiquitous Computing” 
in 1991.  He claimed computers should be transparent and invisible. 

He claimed that the most profound technologies are invisible.  They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday

life until they are indistinguishable from it.

His team designed a variety of computational devices including Tabs, Pads, and Boards along with the

infrastructure to allow these devices to talk with each other.


Recently, he is introducing a concept of “calm technology” citing the LIVE 
WIRE by Natalie Jeremijenko as an example.

Subject: "Tangible Bits" 
Dear Hirosh and Brygg, 
i 

l 

I recently had a chance to read your CHI 97 paper "Tangible Bits"! 
Great work!  In my opinion this s the k nd of work that will characterize the technologica
i
i
landscape in the twenty-first century. 
.......... 
My request is that you help me stop the spread of misunderstanding of ubiquitous computing 
based s mply on its name. Ubicomp was never just about making "computers" 
i
ubiquitous. It was always, like your work, about awakening computation mediation 
into the environment. 
.......... 
I tried to stop using ubiquitous computing because of its misleading implication, but it 
keeps cropping up again, so I keep returning to it as my umbrella name for lots of work, 
uding Things That Think.  Augmented reality was in use for awhile, but again got 
incl
balkanized in meaning.  I have started to talk about Calm Technology as a theme, but it 
i
ject. 
"Tangible Bits" is very n ce, and maybe could 
better names a goal than a research pro
serve as an overall umbrella, but then you might lose it as the name of your research 
project!

Natalie Jeremijenko designed a beautiful instrument called Live Wire 
while an artist in residence at Xerox PARC.

It is a piece of plastic cord that hangs from a small electric motor mounted on the ceiling.  The motor is linked to 

the Ethernet, and each passing digital packet causes a tiny twitch of the motor.


Bits flowing through the wires of a computer network become tangible 
through motion, sound without being obtrusive, taking advantage of 
peripheral cues. 
This work encouraged us to think about ambient media as a general 
mechanism for displaying activities in cyberspace.

“The Computer for the 21st Century” 

“The most profound technologies are those that
disappear. 
They weave themselves into the fabric of 
everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.” 

Mark Weiser 
July 23, 1952 - April 27, 1999 

© 2004  MIT Media Laboratory,  Hiroshi Ishii 

Mark Weiser wrote as follows in the 1st paragraph of his landmark 
paper on Ubiquitous Computing published in 1991 Scientific America . 
“The most profound technologies are those that disappear.  They weave 
themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable 
from it.” 
If you learn the task quite well using the right tools, and become the 
master, the tools cease to be a center of users’ attention.  �Tools disappear 
into the background and you can concentrate on the tasks themselves. 
This is the definition of transparent or invisible computers by Mark.  
Invisible does not mean you can not see with your eyes.  It is the matter of 
user’s focus of attention and consciousness.  It is the state in which 
tools do not get in your way and you can concentrate on the task. 
Mark showed a series of ubiquitous computers including Live Board, Pads, 
and Badges.  All of them come with screens and GUIs.  But I do not feel 
Ubiquitous GUI is the path to achieve invisible interface.  Today, I 
would like to show my approach: Tangible Interfaces.

At the Border 

Where the land meets the sea, 
there is a border. 

© 2004  MIT Media Laboratory,  Hiroshi Ishii 

Where the land meets the sea, there is a border.  This borderline is 
constantly moving and changing the shape of the shore.  However, it is not 
only a simple line of a landscape, but also a critical biological locale.

Living at the Border 

Harsh, but also fertile environment. 

© 2004  MIT Media Laboratory,  Hiroshi Ishii 

Whenever the tides go in and out, the inhabitants in 
the intertidal zone experience harsh environmental 
changes.  When the tidal animals are exposed, they 
must withstand the heat and drying.  When they are 
submerged, they must face constant pounding of 
waves. 
Living at this border is hard, but it is also a fertile 
environment for many kinds of life and activity.  
Where the land meets the sea, countless creatures 
have evolved diverse and creative approaches for 
flourishing among the turbulence and constant 
changes of these competing worlds. 
Our ancestors came from the sea and landed 
crossing this border a million years ago.

At the Border 
between Physical and Digital 

We live on the border where bits meet atoms. 
In the flood of pixels from the ubiquitous GUI
screens, we are losing our sense of body and
places. 
Pixels impoverish human senses. 

© 2004  MIT Media Laboratory,  Hiroshi Ishii 

We are now crossing another border.  

Where bits meet atoms, there is another shoreline.  

Today, we live on the boundary between physical space  

and cyberspace.  

The constant pounding by waves of bits from screens 

distorts our experience of space. People are losing their

sense of body and places in the flood of pixels from the  

ubiquitous rectangular screens. 

Living on this border is hard because our bodies remain 

in the physical world, even while we are immersed within  

digital information. It is also hard because current  

interfaces are not designed for amphibians.  We are half

drowning in the sea of bits, squeezing plastic mice  

instead of breathing and swimming.  

People are standing at the water's edge at a loss.


10 

At the Boundary 
Where the sea meets the land, life has blossomed into a myriad of 
unique forms in the turbulence of water, sand, and wind. 

At another seashore between the land of atoms and the sea of bits, we 
are now facing the challenge of reconciling our dual citizenships in the 
physical and digital worlds.  Windows to the digital world are confined 
to flat square screens and pixels, or "painted bits."  Unfortunately, one 
can not feel and confirm the virtual existence of this digital 
information through one's body. 

Tangible Bits seeks to realize seamless interfaces between humans, 
digital information, and the physical environment by giving physical 
form to digital information and computation, making bits directly 
manipulable and perceptible.

Let me show another art work. This is my drawing on a fridge door in 1959. I 
loved drawing. Since then, drawing has been a very important medium in 
which I think, express myself and communicate with my mother.

ClearBord, the shared drawing media I designed, is deeply rooted in my drawing practices and my 
liking for the whiteboard. 

Our goal was to create a collaboration medium that seamlessly integrated the IPS and the SWS. 

We designed ClearBoard to allow users to shift easily between these spaces by using familiar 
everyday cues such as the partner's gestures, head movements, eye contact, and gaze direction.

© 2004  MIT Media Laboratory,  Hiroshi Ishii 

Most current video telephony systems have been designed to see "talking heads," and to create an illusion as if all the participants sit in  

an imaginative conference room. But this goal to simulate as close as to the real face to face meeting, however, it is something like a  

mirage.  It can never be achieved 100%.  The gap between the recognizable reality and virtuality cannot be filled by technology. 

As long as we try to find the raison d'etre of communication media only in its being "tele", we shall never be able to solve this 

contradiction.  Conventional logic that it saves travel expenses and time should be reviewed.

Our goal is to go beyond this model and demonstrate new usage of video communication technologies. To do so, we have integrated

groupware technology and real-time video communication technology to go beyond the imitation of physical proximity.

Instead of pursuing the illusion of "Being there", we should focus on the creation of added value which cannot be obtained from face to  

face conversation.

Beyond Multimedia

– 
Multimedia = a premature label that represents a 
stage of media evolution from the mono-media to 
the seamless media. 

• 

© 2004  MIT Media Laboratory,  Hiroshi Ishii 

"Multimedia" is now becoming a big buzz word in the computer and communication industries.  As a result, the number of cables behind a computer, 
the number of features users need to understand, and the number of incompatible data formats are increasing beyond the limits of human cognitive 
capability. 

The communication channels of human beings are inherently multi-modal and seamless.  It does not make much sense to decompose the 
representation of information into primitive data types such as text, video, audio, and graphics, and stress the "multi-ness" of the media.  For 
example, we are speaking, gesturing, and drawing simultaneously in a design meeting.  We have great skills to express ideas and understand each 
other in everyday contexts using all these media as a whole. 
We believe the multi-ness of media is not the main issue, but how to integrate them into a seamless media hiding the various low level 
representations, discontinuities among primitive media, and complexity of underlying technologies is the core issue in designing new applications.  

"Multi-media" sounds like a premature label that represents a stage of media evolution from the mono-media to the seamless media.

PDA in 1958 - Abacus 

© 2004  MIT Media Laboratory,  Hiroshi Ishii 

When I was 2 years old, I started playing with a PDA called the "abacus".

It was more than my mother's financial calculator.  The abacus became my  

musical instrument, imaginary toy train, even back-scratcher.  I enjoyed the  

sound and tactile interaction with this simple physical artifact.  

The abacus also became a medium of awareness.  When my mother used  

the abacus to manage household accounts, I learned she could not play with  

me while her abacus made its music.    

My childhood abacus is suggesting us a future direction of HCI. That is the  

reason why I started the Tangible Bits project at MIT.

Eyes are fully employed, but hands are underusedHands are under­
employed.  GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) are designed for human eyes, 
not for hands.  Telepresence, or interpersonal communication, is not the 
exception.  Communication media such as telephones, video conferencing, 
and e-mail are for human ears and/or eyes, but not for hands.  McCullough 
articulated the importance of hands as follows, “By pointing, by pushing and 
pulling, by picking up tools, hands act as conduits through which we extend 
our will to the world. They serve also as conduits in the other direction: 
hands bring us knowledge of the world.  Hands feel. They probe.  They

This slide shows the various architectural drawing instruments used in 19th 
century.  Long before the invention of personal computers, our ancestors 
developed a variety of specialized physical artifacts to draw geometric 
shapes. 
Grasping and manipulating those instruments, users of the past must have 
developed unique and rich languages, cultures, and aesthetics  which value 
haptic interaction with real physical objects. 
We began our investigation of "looking to the future of HCI" at a museum by 
looking for what we have lost in the flood of personal computers.  Our 
intention is to find a way to rejoin the richness of the physical world in HCI.

Tangible interface is an interface design approach to give  

physical forms to digital information to make it tangible.   

It makes bits directly manipulable with our hands, and 

perceptible through our peripheral senses.  

The first path to the Tangible Interface is the direct 

manipulation with hands. 

Second path is the use of ambient media to make people  

aware of digital information at the periphery of perception.   

Pinwheels is such an example.

The Tangible Interface explores the way to weave  

interfaces with the digital world into the fabric of a  

physical and social context.

This slide illustrates the framework of “center and periphery” of human perceptions.  The ambientROOM 
was designed to achieve two goals: 
1) to grasp & manipulate bits in the center of user's focus by coupling bits with physical objects and 
surfaces, and 
2) to be aware of bits at the periphery using ambient display media such as light, sound, airflow, and 
water movement. 
We get information in two main ways.  First, we get information from what we are focusing on, where our center of attention is directed.  But

at the same time, we also get information from ambient sources.

We may have a sense of the weather outside from ambient cues such as light, temperature, sound, and air flow from the open windows.  We 

may also have an idea of the activities of our colleagues from the ambient sound and the shadows of passers-by. 

Our brain is not only capable of processing this ambient information while maintaining a focus elsewhere, 
but will naturally shift such information to our foreground when our subconscious deems it important.  By 
using ambient media, we can take advantage of our brain's abilities as both a parallel processor and an 
attention manager. 
Current HCI research is primary focusing on foreground activity and neglecting the background.  We 
would like to support seamless transitions of the user's focus of attention between the periphery 
(background) and the center (foreground) of human awareness.

Let me summarize what you saw in this video.

We demonstrated three types of ambient media. 

First, ripple shadow display.  We made a thin water tank outfitted with a small robot which taps  

water being "pulled by bits."  With each pull, the robot creates a ripple on the surface of  

water.  Light projected onto the water tank from above casts a subtle but poetic image of ripples

on the ceiling of the room.

Second, subtle light projection on a side wall provide awareness of activities in a remote working  

place. 

Third, ambient sound of rain drops or water stream is used to let people be aware of activities in  

cyberspace such as network traffic.

Touch is underdeveloped.  Touch is a fundamental aspect especially of 
interpersonal communication. Physical contact is a basic means through 
which people achieve a sense of connection and express emotion. 
Communication through touch, however, has been left largely unexplored in 
telepresence research.  Visual and auditory extension of space was 
dominant approach of telepresence as represented by ClearBoard. 
In this summer, we have started the implementation of a distributed 
prototype via a computer network.  The goal of this design is to allow the 
virtual connection of inTouch-1 to extend over any arbitrary distance. 

In experiments using inTouch-1, in conjunction with audio communication, for longer periods 
of two-person interactions, subjects often noted that the haptic interaction with inTouch-1 
was distracting at first, but later fell more into the background of perception.  When this 
happened subjects felt that the interaction became more natural and smooth. Subjects also 
general felt that the haptic channel presented a “subtle but deep and revealing” addition to 
audio communication.  More specifically users commented that the haptic channel allowed 
them to get a better sense of the other person’s emotional state and sincerity.  Finally, some 
users expressed feelings of awkwardness when interactions with an acquaintance became 
more rhythmical, since they associated such movements with more intimate relationships.

Touch is also a fundamental aspect of 
interpersonal communication.  We use touch to 
achieve a sense of connection, indicate intention, 
and express emotion. 
Though often subtle, touch can be a very powerful 
mechanism through which we express our 
thoughts and feelings to others. 
Current telecommunications technology, however, 
lacks the mechanism for expression through touch. 
The goal of our work is to enhance real-time 
remote collaboration and communication by 
bringing a greater sense of touch and physicality to 
distributed multi-user interactions.

© 2004  MIT Media Laboratory,  Hiroshi Ishii 

We have primarily described Synchronized Distributed Physiacl Objects as a 
means for extending the Tangible Interface approach into the realm of 
distributed CSCW.  In our observations of and discussions with users of both 
PSyBench and inTouch, however, we have found that this approach also 
suggests a method for providing a new type of awareness of remote users. 
In traditional telecommunication systems we get the distinct impression that 
the distant user is in a space that is separate from our own.  They are, for 
example, isolated in the digital world on the other side of our computer 
screen, where we are unable to touch them or share our physical world with 
them. 
In providing distant users with a shared physical space, we begin to see a 
new form of awareness of the physical presence of the distant user within 
our own space.  As the objects on the surface of PSyBench or the rollers on 
inTouch move around "on their own", we are compelled to imagine the 
position and actions of the person causing that movement... much like a 
player piano compels us to imagine the a real body sitting at the piano bench 
with arms extending to the keys.  And we tend to imagine that presence 
within our own space; a sort of ghostly presence in our environment which 
can see and manipulate the same objects that we have access to.

The ComTouch project is about designing a touch communication device for

touch. Touch conveys a wealth of personal information. Although we know 
that tactile communication devices do exist, we were interested in further 
development of touch communication, particularly assessing in what ways 
touch can enhance audio interaction.

Touch to vibration mapping 

© 2004  MIT Media Laboratory,  Hiroshi Ishii 

We chose to implement the touch-to-vibration mapping for the hand as 
shown here. For each finger, there are three different areas under the finger. 
Fingertip pressure is converted into vibration frequency and intensity. 
Because this is such a non-intuitive mapping , we implement a feedback 
channel so that the sender can feel their squeeze. 
This vibration is sent to a corresponding partner, who can squeeze back. 
By pressing harder… stronger and faster vibrations will result.

curlybot  is an  toy  that can  record and playback physical motion. As one plays with  it, 
it remembers 
how  it  has  been  moved  and  can  replay  that  movement  with  all  the  intricacies  of  the 
original gesture; every pause, acceleration, and even the shaking in the user's hand, is 
recorded.  curlybot  then  repeats  that  gesture  indefinitely  creating  beautiful  and 
expressive patterns. 
=== 
We  introduce  an  educational  toy,  called  curlybot,  as  the  basis  for  a  new  class  of  toys 
aimed  at  children  in  their  early  stages  of  development  - ages  four  and  up.  curlybot  is 
an autonomous two-wheeled vehicle with embedded electronics that can record how it 
has  been  moved  on  any  flat  surface  and  then  play  back  that  motion  accurately  and 
repeatedly. Children can use curlybot  to develop  intuitions  for advanced mathematical 
and  computational  concepts,  like  differential  geometry,  through  play  away  from  a 
traditional computer. 

In  our  preliminary  studies,  we  found  that  children  learn  to  use  curlybot  quickly.  They 
readily  establish  an  affective  and  body  syntonic  connection  with  curlybot,  because  of 
its  ability  to  remember  all  of  the  intricacies  of  their  original  gesture;  every  pause, 
acceleration,  and  even  the  shaking  in  their  hand  is  recorded.  Programming  by 
example  in  this  context makes  the  educational  ideas  implicit  in  the  design  of  curlybot 
accessible to young children.

Since 1996, we have been exploring several key design 
principles of Tangible Interface.  One of these principle is 
the “coincidence of input and output space.”  It is critical 
to blur the boundary of input/output, and 
representation/control to make information tangible. 
An initial example was inTouch designed for haptic 
interpersonal communication.  Today, the curlybot will 
demonstrate a realization of this principle with special 
focus on mathematical education and narrative

The Triangles allow users to feel as if they are actually holding and

confirmation when connections are made or broken. 
Triangles is Not 'digitally enhanced' version of existing object.  Triangles is 
the new language, digital and physical language. 

Now let me introduce the Triangles, the final example of Tangible Bits 
project. 
The Triangles system is a physical/digital construction kit, which allows users 
to grasp and manipulate complex digital information with two hands.  The 
system consists of a set of identical flat, plastic triangles, each with a 
microprocessor inside and magnetic edge connectors, which enable the 
Triangles to be physically connected to each other. 
The connectors pass electricity, allowing the Triangles to communicate 
digital information to each other and to a desktop computer. When the 
pieces contact one another, specific connection information is sent back to a 
computer that keeps track of the configuration of the system. The Triangles 
can be used to make two and three-dimensional objects whose exact 
configuration is known to the computer.

"In the video on the left, we see several people positioning cell phone 
towers on an overhead map.  They can scroll the map by locking down 
one of the towers and moving it.  However, notice how this creates an 
inconsistency between the physical and the digital states of the 
system.  The user must manually adjust the positions of the other 
towers on the table to fix it.  Users can also rotate and zoom the map, 
but this creates an inconsistency as well." 

"By adding actuation to the system, we can automatically correct these 
inconsistencies.  In the video on the right, we see the same scroll, 
rotate, and zoom operations, but the positions of the other pucks on 
the table are automatically updated using magnetic actuation."

Actuation can also be used to synchronize two workbenches in different 
locations, facilitating remote collaboration.  Notice how when a puck is 
moved on one table, it moves in the same way on the other table.  This 
helps 
people to work together remotely using the Sensetable. 

By placing a camera above the workbench, we can capture silhouettes of the 
users' hands.  We then broadcast these hand silhouettes to the other

Upon opening the weather bottle, she would be greeted by the 
sound of singing birds if the following day’s weather was 
forecasted to be clear. On the other hand, hearing the sound of 
rainfall from the bottle would indicate impending rain. 
Such an interface would  be consistent with the everyday 
interactions with her familiar physical environment, such as 
opening a bottle of soy sauce.  She never clicked a mouse or 
typed a URL in her life, but opened soy sauce bottles thousands 
of times.

Tangible interface is an interface design approach to give  

physical forms to digital information to make it tangible.   

It makes bits directly manipulable with our hands, and 

perceptible through our peripheral senses.  

The first path to the Tangible Interface is the direct 

manipulation with hands. 

Second path is the use of ambient media to make people  

aware of digital information at the periphery of perception.   

Pinwheels is such an example.

The Tangible Interface explores the way to weave  

interfaces with the digital world into the fabric of a  

physical and social context.

“The Computer for the 21st Century” 

“The most profound technologies are those
that disappear. 
They weave themselves into 
the fabric of everyday life until they are 
indistinguishable from it.” 

Mark Weiser 
July 23, 1952 - April 27, 1999 

© 2004  MIT Media Laboratory,  Hiroshi Ishii 

Mark Weiser wrote as follows in the 1st paragraph of his landmark 
paper on Ubiquitous Computing published in 1991 Scientific America . 
“The most profound technologies are those that disappear.  They weave 
themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable 
from it.” 
If you learn the task quite well using the right tools, and become the 
master, the tools cease to be a center of users’ attention.  �Tools disappear 
into the background and you can concentrate on the tasks themselves. 
This is the definition of transparent or invisible computers by Mark.  
Invisible does not mean you can not see with your eyes.  It is the matter of 
user’s focus of attention and consciousness.  It is the state in which 
tools do not get in your way and you can concentrate on the task. 
Mark showed a series of ubiquitous computers including Live Board, Pads, 
and Badges.  All of them come with screens and GUIs.  But I do not feel 
Ubiquitous GUI is the path to achieve invisible interface.  Today, I 
would like to show my approach: Tangible Interfaces.

At the Boundary 
Where the sea meets the land, life has blossomed into a myriad 
of unique forms in the turbulence of water, sand, and wind. 

At another seashore between the land of atoms and the sea of 
bits, we are now facing the challenge of reconciling our dual 
citizenships in the physical and digital worlds.  Windows to the 
digital world are confined to flat square screens and pixels, or 
"painted bits."  Unfortunately, one can not feel and confirm the 
virtual existence of this digital information through one's body. 

Tangible Bits seeks to realize seamless interfaces between 
humans, digital information, and the physical environment by 
giving physical form to digital information and computation, 
making bits directly manipulable and perceptible.

Mark Weiser at Xerox PARC presented his vision of “Ubiquitous Computing” 
in 1991.  He claimed computers should be transparent and invisible. 

He claimed that the most profound technologies are invisible.  They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday

life until they are indistinguishable from it.

His team designed a variety of computational devices including Tabs, Pads, and Boards along with the

infrastructure to allow these devices to talk with each other.


Recently, he is introducing a concept of “calm technology” citing the LIVE 
WIRE by Natalie Jeremijenko as an example.

Taking advantage of the multi-modality of  human 
interactions with the physical world, we are trying to go 
beyond “painted bits”, and establish a new paradigm of 
“Tangible Bits.” 
Coupling bits with physical objects and phenomena is the 
key approach, we are trying to make the interfaces 
ubiquitous and transparent.  Ultimately, we believe the 
architectural space itself should be an interface between 
people and digital information space

Since 1996, we have been exploring several key design 
principles of Tangible Interface.  One of these principle is 
the “coincidence of input and output space.”  It is critical 
to blur the boundary of input/output, and 
representation/control to make information tangible. 
An initial example was inTouch designed for haptic 
interpersonal communication.  Today, the curlybot will 
demonstrate a realization of this principle with special 
focus on mathematical education and narrative 
expression.

Another principle is the augmentation of existing objects 
to develop on top of existing understanding and skills. 
The bottles demonstrated in SIGGRAPH 99 emerging 
technologies is such an example.  HandSCAPE to be 
presented by Jay Lee is another example to augment 
existing tape measure to bridge to the world of digital 
modeling. 

Now I would like to introduce Phil Fre who is presenting

Augmented Reality is a new research stream which tries to integrate the real world and 
computational media. 

There are many important work including Myron Krueger’s pioneering work of VIDEOPLACE in 1985.

DigitalDesk by Wellner is one of early work which demonstrated a way to merge physical and digital document by using video projection of

computer display onto a real desk with physical documents.


The most common AR approach is the visual overlay of digital information onto real-world imagery

Eyes are fully employed, but hands are underusedHands are under­
employed.  GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) are designed for human eyes, 
not for hands.  Telepresence, or interpersonal communication, is not the 
exception.  Communication media such as telephones, video conferencing, 
and e-mail are for human ears and/or eyes, but not for hands.  McCullough 
articulated the importance of hands as follows, “By pointing, by pushing and 
pulling, by picking up tools, hands act as conduits through which we extend 
our will to the world. They serve also as conduits in the other direction: 
hands bring us knowledge of the world.  Hands feel. They probe.  They 
practice.” [McCullough, 1996 #1].
