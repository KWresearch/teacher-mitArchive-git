Intro to angular motion

 Important Concepts
Equations for angular motion are mostly identical to those
for linear motion with the names of the variables changed.
Location where forces are applied is now important.

 For an extended object, all of the equations learned
last fall apply exactly without approximations to the
motion of the center of mass.
 This is true whether or not an object is also rotating.
 The two motions (linear position of the center of
mass and rotation around the center of mass) can
be considered separately, except for kinetic energy
where everything gets lumped into one equation.

Vector Nature of Angular Motion

First Strange Feature of Angular Motion

 Position    x
 Velocity    v
 Acceleration   a
 Force   F
 Mass   M
 Momentum   p

 Angle     θ
 Angular velocity    ω
 Angular acceleration   α
 Torque   τ
 Moment of Inertia   I
 Angular Momentum   L

Most of the problems we will consider will involve
only motion about a single axis, effectively 1-D
1-D is still a vector (up/down or left/right, for example).
For the two directions of rotation, use clockwise (CW) and
counter-clockwise (CCW).
The choice of which one is positive is arbitrary but you
need to be consistent throughout a problem.
 However, CW and CCW do not a really specify a
unique direction, so where is the vector?

What is the vector associated with angular motion?
 The only unique direction in the problem is the axis,
but again, there are two directions along the axis.
 The vector for any angular quantity (θ, ω , α, τ, J)
points along the axis with the direction given by a
right-hand-rule.
Fingers curl in direction of θ, ω, α , τ ,  J, thumb points in the
direction of the vector

 All equations are exactly identical to those for linear
motion but with the variables renamed.

Constraints/Connections between Linear
and Angular Motion

 For all points on a rigid object and for any axis
considered, the value of ω and α are identical.
 For a point a distance R from  the axis of a rotating
object, the path traveled and the angle are related
by S=Rθ, which implies that v=Rω, and a=Rα.
 Tangential acceleration of a point a distance R from
the axis of a rotating object is Rα.
 Radial acceleration of a point a distance R from the
axis of a rotating object is v2/R.

Rolling Without Slipping

 For an object rolling without slipping, the point in
contact with the ground has a speed of exactly zero
so that it is not sliding along the ground.
 Use relative velocity concepts to show that the
center of mass of the wheel must be moving with a
velocity given by v=Rω and an acceleration a=Rα.
 The same constraints apply for a string on a pulley
that is not slipping.  In this case, v and a are for the
end of the string and ω and α are for the pulley.

Torque

More Ways to Think of Torque

Conditions for Equilibrium

 How do you make something rotate?  Very intuitive!
Larger force clearly gives more “twist”.
Force needs to be in the right direction (perpendicular to a
line to the axis is ideal).
The “ twist” is bigger if the force is applied farther away
from the axis (bigger lever arm).
 In math-speak:

Magnitude of the force times the component of the
distance perpendicular to the force (aka lever arm).
Magnitude of the radial distance times the
component of the force perpendicular to the radius.
 Direction from Right-Hand-Rule for cross-products
and can also be thought of as clockwise (CW) or
counter-clockwise (CCW).

Torque is out 
of the page

 For torque, gravity acts at the center of mass.

 Same as before:
It’s totally irrelevant where the forces are applied to an
object, only their direction and magnitude matters.
This gives one independent equation per dimension.

 Additional condition:
This is true for any axis.  However, if all of the forces are
in the same plane (the only type of problem we will
consider in this class), you only get one additional
independent equation by considering rotation.
