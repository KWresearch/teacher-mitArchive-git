Pendulums and Kinetic Energy of rotation
 Important Concepts
Equations for angular motion are mostly identical to those
for linear motion with the names of the variables changed.
Kinetic energy of rotation adds a new term to the same
energy equation, it does not add a new equation.
Kinetic energy can be simply written as a linear term and
a rotational term

Important Reminders

Pendulums

 Contact your tutor about session scheduling
Mastering Physics due tomorrow at 10pm.
 Pset due this Friday at 11am.

 Simple pendulum: Small mass at the end of a string

Period is                          where l  is the length from the
pivot to the center o f the object.

 Physical pendulum: More complex object rotating
about any pivot

Period is                               where l  is the distance from
the pivot to the center of mass of the object, M is the total
mass, and I is the moment of inertia around the pivot.

Parallel Axis Theorum

Kinetic Energy with Rotation

Everything you need to know for
Linear & Rotational Dynamics

 Very simple way to find moment of inertia for a large
number of strange axis locations.

 Adds a new term not a new equation!
 Rotation around any fixed pivot:





d

c.m.

Axis 1

Moving and rotating:

 I1  = Ic.m. + Md2   where M is the total mass.

This is true for any fixed axis and for an axis through the
center of mass, even if the object moves or accelerates.
 Rolling without slipping:
Friction does NOT do work!
 Rolling with slipping:
Friction does work, usually negative.
Rarely solvable without using force and torque equations!
