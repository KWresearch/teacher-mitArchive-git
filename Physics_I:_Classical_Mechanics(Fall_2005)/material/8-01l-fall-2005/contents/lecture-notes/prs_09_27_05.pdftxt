Consider an object moving with constant speed, v, in a circle with constant radius, R. Which of the following is true? 1) The speed is constant so the magnitude of the acceleration is zero. 2) The distance from the center is constant so the radial component of the velocity is always zero so the radial component of the acceleration must be zero. 3) The speed is constant so the component of the acceleration in the direction of motion is always zero. 4) The component of the acceleration in the direction of motion is not zero. 5) The radial component of the acceleration and the component in the direction of motion are sometimes zero and sometimes not. 6) More than one of the above is true. 7) None of the above is true.  These two forces can add up to zero under the following conditions:  1) Never, itâ€™s impossible. 2) Only for the right values of the magnitudes of T and M. 3) Only for the right value of the angle. 4) Only for the right values of the magnitudes and the angle. 5) Need more information to answer.
