8.01L IAP 2006 1/17/2006 Consider a wheel rolling without slipping down a slanted surface with friction.  Which of the following is true?  1) The linear acceleration of the wheel along the incline can be calculated from the component of gravity in that direction minus the effect of friction. 2) The total kinetic energy of the wheel at any point can be calculated from the change in potential energy due to gravity minus the work done by friction. 3) The normal force on the wheel due to the surface has no effect on either the acceleration along the incline or the kinetic energy of the wheel.  4) (1) & (2) are true. 5)  (1) & (3) are true.  6) (2) & (3) are true.   7) All three of (1), (2), and (3) are true. 8) None of the above are true. 8.01L IAP 2006 1/17/2006  Four objects travel the same distance down four inclines all tilted at the same angle.
