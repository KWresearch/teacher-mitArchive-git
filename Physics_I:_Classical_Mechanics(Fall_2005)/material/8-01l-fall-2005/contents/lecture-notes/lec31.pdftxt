Energy and Momentum of rotation
 Today
More about Momentum of rotation
 Important Concepts
Equations for angular motion are mostly identical to those
for linear motion with the names of the variables changed.
Kinetic energy of rotation adds a new term to the same
energy equation, it does not add a new equation.
Momentum of rotation gives an additional equation
There is the additional complication that the moment of
inertia can change.

Moment of Inertia



Hoop (all mass at same radius)   I=MR2
Solid cylinder or disk   I=(1/2)MR2
Rod around end   I=(1/3)ML2
Rod around center   I=(1/12)ML2
Solid sphere   I=(2/5)MR2
 The same object could have a different moment of
inertia depending on the choice of axis.
 In the equation:               all three quantities need to
be calculated using the same axis.

Angular Momentum

Torque Checklist

 Conserved when external torques are zero or when
you look over a very short period of time.
True for any fixed axis and for the center of mass
 Formula we will use is simple:
Vector nature (CW or CCW) is still important
 Point particle:
 Conservation of angular momentum is a separate
equation from conservation of linear momentum

 Angular impulse:

 Make a careful drawing showing where forces act
Clearly indicate what axis you are using
Clearly indicate whether CW or CCW is positive
 For each force:
If force acts at axis or points to or away from axis, τ=0
Draw (imaginary) line from axis to point force acts.  If
distance and angle are clear from the geometry τ=Frsin(θ)
Draw (imaginary) line parallel to the force.  If distance
from axis measured perpendicular to this line (lever arm)
is clear, then the torque is the force times this distance
 Don’t forget CW versus CCW, is the torque + or −
