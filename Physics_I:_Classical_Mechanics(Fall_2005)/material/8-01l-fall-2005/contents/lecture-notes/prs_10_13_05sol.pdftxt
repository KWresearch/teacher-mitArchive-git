There may or may not be friction between
the block and the table. Now, assume that
the block moves to the right at constant
velocity. Which of the following is true
(only one is correct)?
1) This is possible without any friction
2) This is impossible without friction; it
might be possible if there is friction
between block and table. Need more info to
be sure.
3) This is impossible without friction; it
definitely would be possible if there is
friction between block and table
4) This is impossible even if there is friction

If you got the right answer today to the 
previous question, I’m interested in your
thought processes.
1) I got the right answer before and I think I
understand it (be honest, only 25 of you
answered correctly last week).
2) I got the right answer before but I don’t
really understand it (be honest, only 25 of
you answered correctly last week).
3) I remembered that this was the right
answer from last week and I think I
understand it.
4) I remembered that this was the right
answer from last week but I don’t really
understand it.
5) I remembered that this was the right
answer from last week but I don’t really
believe it.
6) I didn’t remember that this was the right
answer from last week but I figured it out on
my own today.
7) I made a wild guess.

You know that there is friction between the 
block and the table. Assume that the block
moves down the incline.  Which of the
following is true (only one is correct)?
1) The force of friction is zero
2) The force of friction obviously points in
direction L.
3) The force of friction obviously points in
direction R.
4) This situation is physically impossible.
5) I can’t tell what is going on without a
detailed calculation.

You know that there is friction between the 
block and the table. Assume that the block
does not move at all.  Which of the 
following is true (only one is correct)?
1) The force of friction is zero
2) The force of friction obviously points in
direction L.
3) The force of friction obviously points in
direction R.
4) This situation is physically impossible.
