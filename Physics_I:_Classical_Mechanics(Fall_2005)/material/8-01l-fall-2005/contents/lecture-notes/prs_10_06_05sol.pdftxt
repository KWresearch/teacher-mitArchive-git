 There may or may not be friction between the block and the table.  Assume that the block does not move at all.  Which of the following is true (only one is correct)? 1) This is possible without any friction 2) This is impossible without friction; it might be possible if there is friction between block and table.  Need more info to be sure. 3) This is impossible without friction; it definitely would be possible if there is friction between block and table 4) This is impossible even if there is friction A F Table Up !  There may or may not be friction between the block and the table. Now, assume that the block moves to the right at constant velocity.  Which of the following is true (only one is correct)? 1) This is possible without any friction 2) This is impossible without friction; it might be possible if there is friction between block and table.  Need more info to be sure. 3) This is impossible without friction; it definitely would be possible if there is friction between block and table 4) This is impossible even if there is friction A F Table Up !

There may or may not be friction between the block and the table. Now, assume that the block accelerates to the right.  Which of the following is true (only one is correct)? 1) This is possible without any friction 2) This is impossible without friction; it might be possible if there is friction between block and table.  Need more info to be sure. 3) This is impossible without friction; it definitely would be possible if there is friction between block and table 4) This is impossible even if there is friction A F Table Up !  You know that there is friction between the block and the table. Assume that the block does not move at all.  Which of the following is true (only one is correct)?  1) The force of friction is zero 2) The force of friction obviously points in direction L. 3) The force of friction obviously points in direction R. 4) I can’t tell what is going on without a detailed calculation. A F Up ! L R µ  You know that there is friction between the block and the table. Assume that the block moves down the incline.  Which of the following is true (only one is correct)?  1) The force of friction is zero 2) The force of friction obviously points in direction L. 3) The force of friction obviously points in direction R. 4) I can’t tell what is going on without a detailed calculation. F A Up ! L R µ  You know that there is friction between the block and the table. Assume that the block does not move at all.
