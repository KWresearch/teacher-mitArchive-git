You should immediately forget you ever saw this formula 
but remember the technique used to find it. 

Quadratic Equations 

Important property: Such equations can have 0, 1, or 2 solutions 
depending on the value of b -4ac. 
2
Negative: 0 solutions  Zero: 1 solution  Positive: 2 solutions 

Warning: Only one of the 2 solutions may be physical!
