Introduction to momentum 
 
Today 
 
More on momentum 
 
Combining momentum and energy 
 
Important Concepts 
 
Momentum is a vector, energy is not. 
 
l 
Think carefully about interna versus externa forces. 
l 
 
Energy changes due to forces along the motion, 
 
momentum changes due to externa forces acting over a 
l 
period of time.
