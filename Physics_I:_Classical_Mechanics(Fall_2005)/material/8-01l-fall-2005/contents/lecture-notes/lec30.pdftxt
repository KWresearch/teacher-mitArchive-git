 Today 

Energy and Momentum of rotation 

 Important Concepts 

Equations for angular motion are mostly  identical to those 
for  linear motion with the names of the variables changed. 

Kinetic energy of rotation adds a new term to the same 
energy equation,  it does not add a new equation. 

Momentum of rotation gives an additional equation

Torque Checklist 

Kinetic Energy with Rotation 

 Make a careful drawing showing where  forces act 
Clearly  indicate what axis you are using 
Clearly  indicate whether CW or CCW  is positive 

 For each  force: 
If force acts at axis or points to or away from axis, =0 

Draw (imaginary)  line from axis to point force acts.  If 
distance and angle are clear from the geometry =Frsin() 

Draw (imaginary)  line parallel to the force.  If distance 
from axis measured perpendicular to this  line (lever arm) 
is clear, then the torque  is the force times this distance 

 Don’t  forget CW versus CCW,  is  the  torque + or  

center of mass, even  if the object moves or accelerates.
