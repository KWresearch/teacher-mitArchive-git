Newton’s Third Law

 Acceleration is
Use caution not to confuse m the mass, a property of an
object, and m the meter, a unit of length
 Mass is in kg
 So,  Force is

 N is the Newton, the short unit for force.

Inertial Reference Frames

 These principles only apply for observers who are
not accelerating, a so-called “inertial” frame
 There are philosophical objections to this concept
since it’s hard to precisely define an inertial frame
except as one where Newton’s Laws are valid
 Alternative formulations are beyond the scope of
this course, you don’t need to worry about it

 The most confusing of them all!
 Force due to object A on object B is always exactly
equal in magnitude and always exactly opposite in
direction to the force due to object B on object A.
The two forces are called an “action-reaction” pair
The two forces are equal and opposite in direction but do
not “add to zero and go away” in solving problems
because they act of different objects
It only makes sense to add forces on a single object
If you consider A+B as a single object, then these
forces become “internal” and do drop out

Summary
 Force is related to the change in the velocity vector


 The unit of force is the Newton which equals
  Action-reaction pairs are an important concept in
solving problems but need to be considered very
carefully, especially the fact that the two forces in the
pair act on different objects
 These concepts only apply as phrased here in inertial
reference frames
