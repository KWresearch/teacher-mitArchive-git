An object is swinging on a string. At the instant that it stops at the highest point of its swing, which of the following is true? 1) The object stops so its acceleration is zero. 2) The acceleration in the direction the ball was moving is zero. 3) The string tension must balance gravity so the vertical acceleration is zero. 4) The acceleration in the direction of the string is zero. 5) The acceleration in the horizontal direction is zero. 6) Both 2 & 3 are true. 7) Both 2 & 5 are true. 8) Both 4 & 3 are true. 9) Both 4 & 5 are true. 10) None of the above are true (hit 0 on PRS). Up ! An object is moving in a vertical circle. At one instant, it is moving at a speed v as shown.  Think about force equations for the different axes shown.  Without solving any equations, for which of the 4 components is it guaranteed that there is a non-zero component of the acceleration (i.e. there are clearly unbalanced forces or some other indication)?  1) Only one out of the four 2) Only two out of the four 3) Only three out of the four 4) All four  Up ! v
