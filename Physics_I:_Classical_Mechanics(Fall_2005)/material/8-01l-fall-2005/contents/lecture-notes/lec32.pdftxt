Energy and Momentum of rotation
 Today
More about Momentum of rotation
 Important Concepts
Kinetic energy of rotation adds a new term to the same
energy equation, it does not add a new equation.
Momentum of rotation gives an additional equation
 There is the additional complication that the moment of
inertia can change.
 For particles in orbit, angular momentum gives
information about the direction as well as the speed

Angular Momentum for Orbits

Connection of L and E to Orbit

 Conserved because gravity points radially so it does
not exert any torque.
 Point particle:
 Conservation of angular momentum is a separate
equation from conservation of energy.
 The resulting equations are:

 In general, orbits are ellipses:

 The semi-major axis (denoted "a" in drawing) is
determined by the total mechanical energy.
 The semi-minor axis (denoted "b" in drawing) is
determined by energy and angular momentum.

Torque Checklist

 Basic equations:

 Substitute and do algebra to find:

 And also:                        (don’ t  forget that E<0)   (cid:1)

Make a careful drawing showing where  forces act
Clearly indicate what axis you are using
Clearly  indicate whether CW or CCW is positive
 For each force:
If force acts at axis or points to or away from axis, τ=0
Draw (imaginary) line from axis to point force acts.  If
distance and angle are clear from the geometry τ=Frsin(θ )
Draw (imaginary) line parallel to the force.  If distance
from axis measured perpendicular to this line (lever arm)
is clear, then the torque is the force times this distance
 Don’ t forget CW versus CCW, is the torque + or −
