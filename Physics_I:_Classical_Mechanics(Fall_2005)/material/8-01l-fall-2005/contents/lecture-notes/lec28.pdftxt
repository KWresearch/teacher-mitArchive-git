Moment of Inertia

 Same as before:
Only the direction and magnitude of the forces matter.
This gives one independent equation per dimension.
 Additional condition:
This is true for any fixed axis (for example, a pulley).
In addition, this equation holds for an axis through the
center of mass, even if the object moves or accelerates.
As for statics, if all of the forces are in the same plane,
you only get one additional independent equation by
considering rotation.



Hoop (all mass at same radius)   I=MR2
Solid cylinder or disk   I=(1/2)MR2
Rod around end   I=(1/3)ML2
Rod around center   I=(1/12)ML2
Sphere   I=(2/5)MR2
 The same object could have a different moment of
inertia depending on the choice of axis.
 In the equation:               all three quantities need to
be calculated using the same axis.
