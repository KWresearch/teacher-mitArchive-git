Conclusion of Angular Momentum 

Important Concepts 
 
Kinetic energy of rotation adds a new term to the same 

energy equation, it does not add a new equation. 
Momentum of rotation gives an additiona equation 
l 
There is the additiona complication that the moment of 
l 

inertia can change. 
For particles in orbit, angular momentum gives 
information about the direction as well as the speed
