A box is sitting on the floor of an elevator which is moving up at a constant speed, v. The box has mass MA.  Which of the following is true?  1) Kinetic energy is being converted into gravitational potential energy. 2) The normal force does work on the box, creating gravitational potential energy. 3) The cable pulling up the elevator does work on the box, creating gravitational potential energy. 4) The normal force must be larger than MAg in order to overcome gravity and create the upward energy. 5) The box has constant speed so its total mechanical energy is a constant. 6) More than one of the above. 7) None of the above. A Up ! v  You lift a ball at constant velocity from a height h to a greater height H.  If you consider the ball to be the system, which of the following statements is true? 1) The potential energy of the system increases. 2) The kinetic energy of the system decreases. 3) The earth does negative work on the system. 4) You do negative work on the system. 5) Two of the above are true. 6) Three of the above are true. 7) All of the above are true. 8) None of the above are true.
