8.01L Fall 2005 11/1/2005  The sketch above shows the PE of an object as a function of position.  Assume that the force generating this potential energy is the only force acting on the object.  If a particle is moving around in x, at what point is the particleâ€™s speed a maximum? 1) a 2) b 3) c 4) d 5) e 6) Impossible to answer without more information. 8.01L Fall 2005 11/1/2005  A block is attached to a spring.  The block is released from rest.  After falling a certain distance, the block will again stop momentarily.   Where will the block stop?  1) The block will stop where the force of gravity exactly matches the force of the spring.  2) The block will stop where the potential energy of the spring exactly matches the potential energy of gravity at that point. 3) The block will stop where the potential energy of the spring exactly matches the initial potential energy of gravity. 4) The block will stop where the sum of gravitational and spring potential energy exactly matches the sum when it was released. 5) More than one of the above. 6) None of the above.
