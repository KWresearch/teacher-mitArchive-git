Two objects (labeled A & B) collide. 
Newton’s 3rd law tells us that the force A 
exerts on B must be equal and opposite to 
the force B exerts on A.  Which of the 
following is true: 

1)  The change  in momentum of A due to the 
force between the objects must be equal and 
opposite of the change in momentum of B. 
2) The work done on A by the force between the 
objects must be equal and opposite of the 
work done on B. 
3) The change  in kinetic energy of A due to the 
force between the objects must be equal and 
opposite of the change in kinetic energy of B. 
4) (1) and (2) are true. 
5) (2) and (3) are true. 
6) (1) and (3) are true. 
7) None of the above are true. 
8) All of the above are true.

Identical constant 
forces push two 
identical objects A 
and B continuously 
from a starting line to 
a finish line. If A is 
initially at rest and B 
is initially moving to 
the right, which of the following is true: 

V0  = 0 

1) Object A has the larger change in kinetic 
energy. 
2) Object B has the larger change in kinetic 
energy. 
3)  Both objects have the same change in 
kinetic energy. 
4) There is no change in kinetic energy. 
5) Not enough information is given to decide.
