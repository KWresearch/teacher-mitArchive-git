Problem Set 1: Force and Vectors 

Due Friday, September 16 at the start of class at 10am. 

Please  write  your  name  and  recitation  number  on  the  top  right  corner  of  the  first  page  of  your 
homework  solutions.  In  the  future,  once  you  have  an  assigned  seat,  you  will  need  to  add  your 
table and group number as well.  Please place your solutions in the Problem Set Solution hand-in 
bin at the entrance of the classroom.

Problem 1 Vectors: displacement 

At  2  am  one morning  a person  runs 250 m  along  the  infinite  corridor  at MIT  from Mass Ave  to 
the end (almost) of Building 8, turns right at the end of the corridor and runs 178 m to  the end of 
Building 2, and then turns right and runs 30 m down the hall. 

a) 	 Construct  a  vector  diagram  that  represents  this  motion.  Indicate  your  choice  of  unit 
vectors. 

b)	 What is the direction and magnitude of the straight line between start and finish? 

c) 	 Whose office door is closest to the finish point?

Problem 8 Static Equilibrium: A challenge 
Suppose a rope of mass 
is connected at the same height to two walls and is allowed to 
hang under its own weight. At the contact point between the rope and the wall, the rope makes an 
angle 
with respect to the vertical. In order to find the tension in the rope at the end and at 
the middle of the rope, you will need to think cleverly about what to include as the system in 
your free body diagram. 

a)	 What is the tension at the ends of the rope where they are connected to the wall? Include 
in your answer your free body force diagram. Show all the forces acting on the rope and 
your choice of unit vectors. 

b)	 What is the tension in the rope at the point midway between the walls? Include in your 
answer your free body force diagram. Show all the forces acting on the rope and your 
choice of unit vectors.
