Problem 9 Working with a Block 
Consider the situation  shown in the drawing

at  the  right.  A  block  of  mass  M  is  pushed

along  a  horizontal  surface  by  a  force  F 

making  an  angle  θ  with  the  vertical.  The

coefficients  of  sta tic  and  kinetic  friction  are 

identical and equal to µ.

a)	 Make a clear drawing showing the direction of all the forces acting on the

mass, and find the magnitude of all the forces in terms of F, M, g, µ, and θ.

b)  Assume that the object moves a distance B to the right.  Find the work done 
by each force you listed in part (a). 
c)  If the block has a velocity, V1, to the right initially, find it's velocity, V2, after 
it has moved the distance B to the right. 
d)  Explain how you would decide if the final velocity, V2, is larger than, equal to, 
or smaller than the initial velocity, V1. 

Problem 10 Who is Right? 
Adapted from Giancoli Physics for Scientists and Engineers 

A wooden crate slides down a wooden ramp.  The angle of the ramp and the kinetic 
coefficient of friction are chosen so that the crate slides down the ramp at constant 
speed.  The crate is watched by two observers, one standing on the ramp and one 
sitting on the crate.  Both observers make measurements in a coordinate system 
fixed with respect to themselves. 

a)  Are either of these observers in a non-inertial frame?

b)  Do the two observers agree on the kinetic energy of the crate? 

c)  Do the two observers agree on the work done by any of the forces acting on the

crate?

d)  How would the two observers explain the generation of heat at the surface

between the crate and the ramp.
