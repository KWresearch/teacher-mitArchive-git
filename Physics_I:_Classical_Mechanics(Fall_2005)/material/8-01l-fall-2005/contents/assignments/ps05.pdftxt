Due Friday, October 21 at the start of class at 10am . 

Please write your name, recitation number, table number, and tutor name on the top 
right corner of the first page of your homework solutions.  Please place your solutions 
in the Problem Set Solution hand-in bin at  the entrance of the classroom.

Problem 1 Springs and Pulleys 
Two  masses  (M  and  m)  are  connected  together 
by  a  pulley,  two  strings,  and  a  stretched  spring 
(with spring constant k) as  shown.  Assume tha t 
the  strings,  pulley,  and  spring  all  have 
negligible  mass  and  that  friction  in  the  pulley 
and  on  the  surface  can  be  neglected.  Find  the 
amount by which the spring is stretched. 

M 

Problem 2 Springs, Inclines and Friction 
A box of mass M  sits on an incline elevated  an angle 
 above  the horizontal.  The mass  is  held  in place by 
a  spring  (of  spring  constant  k)  as  shown.  Assume 
that  the  coefficient of  sta tic  friction  between the box 
and the incline is µ. 

a)	 Find  the  maximum  amount  that  the  spring  can 
be  stretched  if  the  mass is to  remain  sta tionary 
on the incline. 

b) Find the maximum amount that  the spring can be 
compressed if the mass is  to remain sta tionary on 
the incline.
