Please write  your name,  recitation  number,  and  tutor name  on  the  top  right  corner 
of  the  first  page  of  your  homework  solutions.  Please  place  your  solutions  in  the 
Problem Set Solution hand-in bin at the entrance of the classroom.

This problem set will give you a chance to practice some (possibly rusty) math skills 

(including trigonometry and geometry) and also begin to work on basic kinematics.


Problem 1 How big is the Moon? 
By viewing a full moon, you will find that the moon's diameter subtends an angle of 
about  0.5  degrees.  (This  means  that  two  lines  drawn  from  your  eye  to  opposite 
edges  of  the moon  have  an  angle  of  0.5  degrees  between  them).  The  distance  from 
the surface of the earth to the center of the moon is about 59 earth radii. 
a)	 Find the radius of the moon in terms of earth radii. 
b)	 How far from your eye would you need to hold a dime to just barely cover the 
Moon?  (Does  the  width  of  your  thumb  cover  the  moon  if  you  hold  your  arm 
out  straight?  The moon  is next full  on  Sep. 18, but a partial moon  is  enough 
to judge the diameter.) 

Problem 2 Geometry and Angles 
a)	 For each of the three figures below, clearly indicate all angles which are 
equal in size to the one marked α.  The small boxes indicate right angles. 

b)	 What is the cosine of all numbered angles in terms of cos(α) or sin(α)?

Problem 6 Wow, that’s fast! 
A  lesson  in  unit  conversion  and  ship,  plane,  (and  pilot!)  requirements.  In  order  to 
take off from an air-craft carrier, a plane is attached to a catapult which accelerates 
it from 0  to 160 mph  (miles per hour) in 2.0 seconds.  Assume  that this acceleration 
is a constant value. 
a)  Calculate  the  acceleration  in  meters  per  second  squared  and  compare  to  the 
value of the gravitational acceleration near the Earth’s surface (9.8 m/s2) 
b)  How long (in meters) must the deck of the aircraft carrier be? 

Problem 7 Falling-apart Elevator 
An  elevator  ascends  with  an  upward  acceleration  of  1.75  m/s2.  At  the  instant  its 
upward  speed  is  2.0  m/s,  a  loose  bolt  drops  from  the  ceiling  of  the  elevator  3.5  m 
from  the  floor.  Calculate  the  time  of  flight  of  the  bolt  from  the  ceiling  to  the  floor. 
Assume  that  the  elevator  continues  its  upward  acceleration. 
(Use  a  frame  of 
reference fixed with respect to the elevator shaft.)

A  nasty  teenager  is  dropping  tomatoes  from  a  bridge  onto  cars  on  the  road  below. 
The  height  of  the  bridge  (the  point  from  which  the  tomatoes  are  dropped)  is  10  m 
above the ground.  The teen first sees cars when they come around a corner which is 
50 m away.  All cars drive at exactly the speed limit of 40 kilometers per hour.  You 
may use g=10 m/s2  to solve these problems. 

a)  How  long  after  a  car  comes  around  the  curve  does  she  need  to  wait  before 
dropping  a  tomato  to  hit  the  hood  of  the  car  at  a  height  of  1.0  m  above  the 
ground? 

b)  After  some  time,  the  teen  gets  bored  with  just  dropping  the  tomatoes.  As  a 
challenge,  she  decides  to  throw  the  tomatoes  straight  up  with  some  initial 
velocity,  v0,  rather  than  just  dropping  them.  Assume  she  throws  the  tomatoes 
1.5  s  after  she  sees  the  cars.  What value  of  v0  is needed  for  the  tomatoes  to  hit 
the cars at the same height above the road? 

c)  Eventually, the  teen gets bored with this new game and  she decides  to  throw 
the  tomatoes  straight down  at an  initial  velocity  of  15 m/s.  Now, how  long  does 
she need to wait after seeing the cars to hit them at the same height?
