Physical Constants:

g = 9.8 m/s2  Use the approximate value g = 10 m/s2 where told to do so.

G = 6.67×10−11 N m2/kg2

k = 1.38×10-23 J/K 

R = 8.31 J/(mol. K)


Density of water = 1,000 kg/m3

Atmospheric pressure = 1.0×105 Pa

Conversion reminder: 

π radians = 180o

Lazy Physicist 's Favorite Angle: (to be used when calculators are not allowed):

36.9o and 53.1o are the angles of a 3-4-5 right triangle so:
