Problem 1 
A  sprinter  running  a  100  meter  race  starts  at  rest,  accelerates  at  constant  acceleration  with

magnitude A for 2 seconds, and then runs at constant speed until the end.

An  object  is  acted  on  by  three  forces.  All  three  forces  have  exactly 
the  same  magnitude.  Two  of  the  forces  are  perpendicular  and 
the  third  acts  at  an  angle  as  shown  above.  No  other  forces  act 
on  this  object.  Which  of  the  following  is  true?  For  full  credit, 
explain your answer. 
1)  It is possible for this particle to remain at rest. 
2)  It is not possible for this particle to remain at rest. 
3)  You  cannot  answer  this  question  without  knowing  the  value  of 
the angle . 
4)  You  cannot  answer  this  question  without  knowing  both  the 
value of the angle  and  the magnitude of the forces F. 

Problem 6 
A  person  pulls  on  a  block  by  applying  a  force  F  and  the  block

remains  at  rest.  The  arrows  in  the  diagram  correctly  show  the

directions,  but  not  necessarily  the  magnitudes,  of  the  various

forces  on  the  block.  Which  of  the  following  relations  among  the

force magnitudes F, W, N,  f must be  true?  f  is  friction  and W  is  the

weight (the force of gravity).

  F = f and N = W

c)  Make an XY plot showing (as dots numbered 0 and  1)  the position  of  the particle at  t=0 and  1

seconds.  On  this  same  plot,  draw  two  arrows  at  each  dot  showing  the  approximate  direction 
of  the  velocity  and  acceleration  at  that  time.  If  either  velocity  or  acceleration  has  zero 
magnitude,  indicate  that  clearly.  Label  your  two  arrows  so  we  know  which  is  which.  Don't 
worry about the length of these arrows,  just their approximate directions 

Problem 8 
While  driving  along  the  highway  at  40  m/s,  you  spot  a  police  car  50  m  ahead,  traveling  at  a 
constant  speed  of  30  m/s  which  is  the  speed  limit.  You  apply  the  brakes  and  begin  decelerating 
at 1.0 m/s2.  Assume that the police officer will give you a speeding ticket only if you pass her car. 
Will  you  get  a  ticket?  Justify  your  answer  numerically.  [Hint:  You  can  solve  this  problem  by 
trying  to  solve  a  quadratic  equation;  look  closely  at  the  numbers!  Instead,  you  might  want  to 
think about when  the cars have equal velocities.] 

Problem 9 
A  rocket,  initially  at  rest  on  the  ground,  accelerates  straight  upward  with  constant  net 
acceleration,  B,  from  time  t=0  until  t=T1,  at  which  time  the  fuel  is  exhausted.  Neglect  air 
resistance and assume  that  the  rocket stays  close enough  to  the ground  that  the acceleration  due 
to gravity  (after the rocket engine stops)  is given by g. 
a)  Find the maximum height, H, that the rocket reaches above the ground. 
b)  If the rocket's net acceleration, B,  is equal to 1.0g, find an expression  for the total time, Tmax, 
that the rocket is in  the air (i.e. from liftoff until  it hits the ground)  in  terms of T1.  You do not 
need to solve your expression numerically but simplify  it as much as possible.

boats  on  the  Charles.  You  see  a  motorboat  pass  directly  below 
you,  traveling perpendicular to  the bridge at a  speed  of  6 m/s.  A 
person  on  the  boat  throws  a  baseball  at  an  initial  speed  of  v0 
and  at an  angle  of  36.9o  from  the vertical  (Note: both  v0  and  the 
angle  are  with  respect  to  the  boat).  Find  the  value  of  v0 
necessary  for  the  ball  to  travel  straight  up  towards  you.  Show

to the boat.
