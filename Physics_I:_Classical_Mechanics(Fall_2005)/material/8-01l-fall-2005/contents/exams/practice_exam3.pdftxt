Problem 1 
a)  Two large spherical stars with masses of M and 2M 
are positioned a distance D apart (measured from 
the center of one star to the center of the other 
star) as shown.  A small spherical asteroid with 
mass m is located with its center exactly halfway 
between the two large stars.  Find the magnitude and direction of the total 
gravitational force acting on the asteroid. 

 

b)  A  small  probe  of  mass  m  is  released  from  rest  at  a  distance  of 
2R above the surface of a spherical planet of mass M and radius 
R.    Find  the  speed  that  the  probe  will  have  when  it  hits  the 
surface  of  the planet.   Assume  that  the  planet  does  not  have  an 
atmosphere and no forces other than gravity act on the probe. 

 
c)  Assume  that  the  probe  is  released  at  the  same  distance  from 
the planet but now with a velocity of 
.  The probe 
has  a  rocket  which  fires  to  put  it  into  a  circular  orbit  at  that 
height.   Find  the  speed  the  probe would  have  once  it  is  in  the 
circular  orbit  and,  using  that,  find  the  work  done  by  the 
rocket.    Assume  that,  at  all  times,  the  probe  is  at  the  same 
distance  from  the  planet  and  that  there  are  no  forces  acting 
on the probe other than the planet’s gravity and the rocket.

  Extra Credit Question This question may require a lot of thought for the points 
available.  Try it only if you have finished with all other problems

through a hole in the shell.  Find the speed of the probe when it gets to the center of 
the hollow shell.  Explain your answer. 
Problem 2 
a)  An object of mass, M=2 kg, is attached to a spring of 
spring constant k=50 N/m which is compressed a 
distance d=20 cm and then released at rest.  Find the 
speed of the object when it has gone past the point 
where the spring is uncompressed and now the 
spring is stretched a distance of 10 cm.  Assume that 
the mass is moving on a horizontal, frictionless 
surface. 
b)  Write an equation for the position of the mass as a function of time with t=0 being the 
instant that the mass was first released from rest.  Use this equation to find out how 
long it takes the mass to get from the initial point with the spring compressed by 20 cm 
to the point where the spring is stretched by 10 cm. (Hint: Think carefully about the 
units of ω when doing the trig functions on your calculator.) 
c)  Write an equation for the velocity as a function of time, using the same definition of 
t=0 as in part (b).  Use this equation to find the velocity (magnitude and direction) 
when the time is 
 where T is the period of motion of the mass on the spring.

straight  up  in  the  air.    The  ball  is  not  attached  to  the 
spring.    The  ball  is  pushed  down  onto  the  spring  so  that 
the  spring 
is  compressed  a  distance  S  below

B)  The diagram shows a binary star system 
with one star of mass M and the other of mass 
5M with the centers of the two stars separated 
by a distance D as shown.  Assume that a third 
small object of mass m is located a distance d 
from the center of the left star.  The centers of 
all three objects are on the same line. 
i)  Is  there  a  value  of  d  for  which  the  total 
gravitational  force on  the small mass  is zero?  
If  so, write  the  equation  you would  solve  to  find  this  value  of  d.   Note  that  you  do NOT 
need to find the value of d.  If there is no such value, explain why not. 
ii)  Using  the  standard  equation  for  potential  energy  due  to  gravity  far  from  the  surface,  is 
there a value of d  for which  the  total gravitational potential energy of  the small mass  is 
zero?    If so, write  the equation you would solve  to  find  this value of d.   Note  that you do 
NOT need to find the value of d.  If there is no such value, explain why not. 
Problem 13 
Rocket A propels an object of mass m  from  the surface of  the Earth  to an altitude 3RE  (RE 
is  the  radius  of  the  Earth)  above  the  surface  of  the  Earth  at  which  point  the  object  stops 
momentarily  before  falling  back.    Rocket  B  propels  an  object  of  the  same  mass  into  a 
circular  orbit  at  an  altitude  of  RE  above  the  surface.    Which  rocket  does  more  work?  
Assume  that  the  initial  velocity  due  to  the  rotation  of  the  Earth  can  be  ignored.    Justify 
your answer. 
Problem 14 
An  object  of  mass  m  is  attached  to  a  spring  of  spring 
constant  k  and  moves  on  a  frictionless  horizontal  surface.  
The mass is at X=0 (where the spring is unstretched) and it 
has  an  initial  velocity  of  V0  in  the  positive  X  direction  as 
shown.    The  subsequent  position  and  velocity  of  the  object 
as a function of time are given by: 
X(t) = Asin(Ct)    and   V(t) = Bcos(Ct) 

 
a)  Find the values of A, B, and C in terms of k, m, and V0. 
 
b)  Since  X=0  at  t=0,  the  average  velocity  between  t=0  and  a  later  time  can  be  written 
simply as 

 Vavg(t)=X(t)/t 
Find the average velocity between t=0 and t=T/2, where T is the period of oscillation of 
the mass on the spring.  Hint: If you think carefully, you can get the answer with almost 
no calculations. 
c)  Find the average velocity between t=0 and t=T/3, where T is the period of oscillation of 
the mass on the spring.  Express your answer in terms of V0 only.  Your answer can 
contain trigonometric functions (like sin, cos, tan, etc.) and numerical constants but no 
variables other than V0.
