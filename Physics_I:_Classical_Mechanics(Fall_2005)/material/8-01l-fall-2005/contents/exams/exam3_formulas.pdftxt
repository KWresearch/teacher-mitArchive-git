Circular  motion  at  constant  speed 
(Centripetal  acceleration,  points

towards center of circle, ω is angular speed in radians per second) 

Adding relative velocities ("wrt" is short for "with respect to"): 


p

= mv 

(momentum) 


(Newton’s first law) 

(Newton’s second law) 

FAB = –FBA 

(Newton’s third law) 


(impulse) 


(position of center of mass) 

F = -kx 

(spring force) 

(Friction force relative to Normal force) 

(gravitational force between two particles) 

(work done by force F) 
(work-energy theorem) 

(force derived from potential energy) 

Potential Energies: 
(spring force) 
(gravitational, general)  U = mgh 

(gravitational, near Earth) 

(Equations for Simple Harmonic Motion) 


Physical Constants: 

g = 9.8 m/s2  Use the approximate value g = 10 m/s2 where told to do so.

G = 6.67×10-11  N m2/kg2

Conversion reminder: 

π radians = 180o 

Lazy Physicist 's Favorite Angle: (to be used when calculators are not allowed):

36.9o  and 53.1o  are the angles of a 3-4-5 right triangle so:
