FINAL EXAM SAMPLE PROBLEMS 

The Final Exam will be given on Monday, January 30 from 9 am - Noon 
There will be no makeup exam. 
You will be provided with a copy of the formula sheet during the exam.  You may wish to 
memorize other formulas but a good understanding of the concepts and applicability of these 
formulas should allow you to do all of the problems on the exam. 
The problems on the following pages are mostly problems from exams in previous 8.01L classes. 
Note that all topics for which you are responsible are NOT included in this sample.  We have 
only included sample problems for the material since the last exam.  You should also review the 
previous three exams (and the sample problems for them) as well as the material included on all 
of the homework assignments.  The final exam will contain about 7-9 problems similar in 
difficulty to these, with roughly half the exam covering material since the last exam. 
Some of these problems were from exams where calculators were allowed.  You will not be 
allowed to use a calculator in this exam. 
Problem 1 
a)	 A closed weather balloon with an initial volume V rises up in the atmosphere to a point where 
the  outside  air  pressure  is  1/10  of  the  pressure  at  the  surface  and  the  temperature  of  the  air 
has dropped by a factor of 3.  Assume  that the balloon  is filled with an ideal gas and that the 
material of  the balloon  exerts no pressure and does not  insulate so  that the  temperature and 
pressure  are  the  same  inside  and  outside  the  balloon.  Does  the  volume  of  the  gas  increase, 
decrease, or stay the same as the balloon rises?  Justify your answer. 
b)	 A solid object of a material with a density of 4000 kg/m3  has a volume of 0.002 m3 and thus a 
mass of 8 kg.  How much force do you need to exert to support this object

i)  In air.

ii)  When it is completely submerged in water.

The density of water is 1000 kg/m3.  Use g=10 m/s2 in this problem. 
c)	 Assume  that  water  is  flowing  through  a  rubber  tube.  Due  to  a  weakness  in  the  material,  a 
section  of  the  tube  expands  so  it  has  a  larger  radius  than  the  other  parts.  Describe  what 
would happen to the water flow velocity and the water pressure in the enlarged section of the 
tube. 
Problem 2 
a)	 Your  physics  professor  is  standing  inside a  cylinder  of  radius  r 
which  is  floating  in  equilibrium  in  water  of  density  ρ.  The 
cylinder is  filled with air of negligible mass.  The physicist and 
cylinder  have  a  combined  total  weight  of  W.  Find  the  depth  d 
to which the bottom of the cylinder sinks into the water. 
b)	 Now  assume  that  the  cylinder  starts  at  a  higher  position  and 
falls down into the water.  Find the acceleration when the bottom of the cylinder is at a depth 
of d/2.  Assume  that you  can ignore  the viscous  force of  the water  (the  liquid equivalent of air 
resistance). 
Problem 3 
a)	 Archeologists have recently uncovered evidence that people living in South America many 
centuries ago were able to climb to the summit of a mountain at a height of 6500 m above sea 
level.  The air pressure at sea level is 
.  Assuming that the atmosphere has an 
average density of 
, find the air pressure at the top of this mountain. 

N/m2  and is 
b)	 Assume that a pressurized helium bottle contains gas at a pressure of 
inside a building at a temperature of 20oC.  If you take the bottle outside to a New Year’s 
Day parade where the temperature is −20oC, what will the pressure inside the bottle be once 
it has fully cooled?

A  standard  track  used  in  almost  all  running  events  consists  of  two 
straight  parts  and  two  semicircles,  each  of  the  four  sections  having 
roughly equal length of 100 m. 
i)  On  the  following  drawing  of  a  runner  rounding  a  curve,  draw  labeled 
arrows  to  show  all  the  forces  acting  on  the runner.  Your  drawing  should 
indicate  clearly  where  the  forces  act  and  their  directions.  The  arrow  on 
the  drawing  points  towards  the  center  of  the  circle.  Assume  that  the 
runner is moving with constant speed. 
ii)  Using  your  picture  from  part  ii)  and  concepts  of  equilibrium,  explain  why  it  is  impossible  to 
run quickly around a curve standing straight up as shown (i.e. without leaning over). 
iii) Draw a force diagram of a leaning runner and explain how leaning over makes rounding the 
curve possible i.e. what changes in the equilibrium equations.  Show clearly the direction of 
the lean assuming that the center of the circle is to the left as in part ii) above. 
Problem 5 
The physics of pushups:  The drawing 
shows a simplified model of the force 
needed to do a pushup.  Assume that a 
person’s body is a bar of mass M with a 
moment of inertia about the pivot (the 
toes) of IT.  Assume that the center of 
mass is a distance L from the pivot and 
that the force shown (due to the arms) is 
purely vertical and applied at a distance 
of 4L/3 from the pivot. 
a)  Draw a  free-body diagram showing all 
the forces acting on the bar. 
b)  Find the value of the applied force F needed for the object to be in equilibrium and show that 
it is independent of the angle θ and thus independent of the height h. 
c)  What is the value of the force (magnitude and direction) exerted on the person by the ground? 
This means the force applied at the toes, not the force applied on the arms. 
Problem 6 
A  plank  of  mass  M  and 
length  L  is held  up  a  cable at 
each  end.  The  left  cable  has 
a  maximum  tension  of  3Mg 
(any more  force and  the cable 
will  break)  while  the  right 
cable  can  exert  a  maximum 
force  of  only  Mg.  A  load  of 
bricks  is  placed  on  the  plank 
with 
its  center  of  mass 
located  a  distance D  from  the 
left edge (see drawing) 
a)  Considering only forces, how massive can the load of bricks be before the cables will fail? 
b)  Assume  that  the  bricks have  the maximum mass  as  calculated  on  part  (a).  Where must  the 
bricks be placed (i.e. what is D) so that neither cable exceeds its maximum tension?

A plank of mass M and length L leans against a wall at one end and 
rests  on  a  circular  support  at  the  other  end.  Assume  that  there  is 
friction between the plank and the wall also between  the ladder and 
the cylinder.  Assume the plank is uniform so its center of mass is at 
the center.  Note that the plank must hit the cylinder tangentially so 
the normal force from the cylinder is perpendicular to the plank and 
the friction force due to the cylinder is along the plank.  Assume that 
the plank does not move. 
a)  Draw a clear diagram showing all the forces acting on the plank. 
b)  Choose  and  X  and  Y  axis  and  write  a  set  of  force  equations  for 
those two directions. 
c)  Write a torque equation using the left end of the plank as the axis. 
d)  Repeat part (c) but using the right edge of the plank as the axis. 
Problem 8 
A uniform bar of mass M and length L is attached to a wall by a 
frictionless hinge (i.e. there are no torques exerted by the hinge). 
The bar is released from rest in a horizontal position as shown.

The bar has moments of inertia about its center and about its end

, respectively. 
and 
of 
a)  What is the angular acceleration of the bar at the instant that it 
is released? 
b)  At  the  instant after  the  bar  is  released,  find  the magnitude and 
direction of the force exerted on the bar by the hinge. 
c)  Use Work/Energy  concepts  to  find  the angular velocity of  the bar when  it has swung down  to 
a vertical position and is just about the hit the wall. 
Problem 9 
A  small  child  runs  and  jumps  onto  a merry-go-round which  has 
a  moment  of  inertia  I0  about  its  axis  of  rotation.  The  child  has 
mass m and is initially moving with velocity v; she grabs onto a 
bar  attached  to  the  plate  which  is  a  distance  R  from  the  center 
of  the  merry-go-round.  The  merry  go  round  was  initially  not 
rotating.  Assume  that  the  child  is  running  tangential  to  the 
merry-go-round before jumping on as shown. 
a)  What  is  the  magnitude  of  the  final  angular  velocity  of  the 
merry-go-round,  ωfinal?  Give  your  answer  in  terms  of  m,  v, 
R and I0. 
b)  What  fraction  of  the  initial  kinetic  energy  of  the  running  child  remains  in  the  final  system 
(i.e. what is KEF/KEI)?  Give your answer in terms of I0, m, v, and R. 
Problem 10 
A  gyroscope  supported  at  one  end  is  rotating  as  shown  (the  edge 
towards  you  is  moving  up,  the  top  edge  is moving  away  from  you, 
the  edge  away  from  you  is  moving  down,  and  the  bottom  edge  is 
moving  towards  you).  Assume  that  the  support  pivot  can  exert 
forces  on  the  gyroscope  but  cannot  exert  any  torques.  For  the 
multiple choice questions, you do not need to explain your answer.

The physics of baseball. 

A  baseball  of  mass  0.15  kg  is  initially  traveling  horizontally  at  50  m/s.  It  is  struck  by  a  bat, 
after  which  the  baseball  is  still  traveling  horizontally  but  in  exactly  the  opposite  direction  from 
its  initial motion  at  a  speed  of  40 m/s.  Consider  the  collision  of  the  bat  and  the  ball.  Assume 
that  before  the  collision,  the  bat  is  moving  in  a  horizontal  circle  at  an  angular  velocity  of  ω 
rad/s.  Assume  that  the  player  holding  the  bat  exerts  no  torque.  The  bat  has  a  moment  of 
inertia  of  0.30  kg  m2  about  the  pivot  and  the  ball  hits  at  a  point  that  is  80  cm  away  from  the 
pivot.  After  the  collision,  the  bat  is  still  swinging  in  the  same  direction  around  the  same  pivot 
but with a reduced angular velocity of 0.35ω.  Find the numerical value of ω.
