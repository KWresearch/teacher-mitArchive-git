For constant acceleration a, if at t = 0 r  = r0 and v  = v0: 

Adding relative velocities ("wrt" is short for "with respect to"): 

(static equilibrium) 

Physical Constants: 
g = 9.8 m/s2  Use the approximate value g = 10 m/s2 where told to do so.

Conversion reminder: 

π radians = 180o 

Lazy Physicist 's Favorite Angle: (to be used when calculators are not allowed):

36.9o  and 53.1o  are the angles of a 3-4-5 right triangle so:


Solution to a Quadratic Equation:  If
