Problem  1 

i) a) Ob ject  A  Same  force,  smaller  mass,  so  A  has  a  bigger   acceleration  and  moves  the  same  distance  in   a

shorter  time. 

ii) c)  Both  are  the  same.  Same  force,  same  distance,  so  the  same  change  in  kinetic  energy.

iii) a) Ob ject  A.  Smaller  mass  so  smaller  normal  force,  therefore  smaller   friction.  Net  force  is  larger  on   A,

so  it  gains  more  kinetic   energy.

iv) a) Ob ject  A.  B  moves  up  and  stops  completely.  At  its  maximum  height,  A  still  has  horizontal  motion.

v)  b)  Ob jects   B  They  start  with  the  same  kinetic  energy  (KE).  B  converts  all  of  its  KE  to  gravitation

potential  energy  (PE),  while   A  always  has  some  non-zero  KE.


Problem  2 

A) iv) Same  force   by Newton’s  3rd   law.

B) iv) None  of   the  above.   NA  − MA g  − F  =  −MAa,  ⇒  NA  =  MA g  +  F  − MAa

C) iii) Less  than  mA g  but  not  zero.  T  − MA g  =  −MAa,  T  =  MA(g  − a)

D) iv)  Normal  force  does  work  and  creates  PE.  N  points  up,  motion  is  up 
+   Work  KE   is  constant,  but

PE  rises.

Problem  11.  Young  &  Freedman  7.58  (pg.  278). 

a) Call  h  = 0  the  bottom  end  of  the  rod   when   it  is  vertical.  Call  the  length  of  the  rod   L:

K EI  = 0,  K EF  =  2 mratv2 +  mmouse v .

The  rod  pivots  around  the   center  so  both  animals  move  at  the  same  speed. 
P EI  =  g (mrat  +  mmouse ) L 
2 ,  P EF  =  g (mrat  − mmouse )L. 
W  = 0,  since  no  forces  other  than  gravity:  v2 =  (mrat −mmouse )Lg  , v  = 1.8m/s.
