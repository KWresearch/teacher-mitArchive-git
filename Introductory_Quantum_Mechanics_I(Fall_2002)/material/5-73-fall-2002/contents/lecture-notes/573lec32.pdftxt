KEY IDEAS:

* 1/rij destroys spin-orbital labels as good quantum numbers.
* Configuration splits into widely spaced L-S-J “terms.”
∑
*                 is a scalar operator with respect to L, S, and J thus matrix elements
1 / rij
j>
       are independent of ML, MS, and MJ.
i
* Configuration generates all possible ML, MS components of each L-S term.
* It can’t matter which ML, MS component we use to evaluate the 1/rij matrix
elements
* Method of microstates and boxes: Book-keeping which L-S states are present,
organize the algebra to find eigenstates of L2 and S2, basis for “sum rule”
method (next lecture).

Longer term goals:  represent “electronic structure” in terms of
properties of atomic orbitals
1. Configuration → L,S terms
2. Correct linear combination of Slater determinants for each
L,S term:  several methods
3. 1/rij matrix elements → Fk, Gk Slater-Condon parameters,
Slater sum rule trick
4. HSO
* ζ(NLS) — coupling constant for each L-S term in an
    electronic configuration
 * ζ(NLS) ↔ ζnl  one spin-orbit orbital integral for entire
    configuration
* full HSO matrix in terms of ζnl
5. Stark, Zeeman, optical transitions
l′ + 1
6. transition strengths
  n r nl
There are a vastly smaller number of orbital parameters than the
number of electronic states.  The periodic table provides a basis for
rationalization of orbital parameters (dependence on atomic number
and on number of electrons.)

Sometimes all we want to know is “which L-S terms”?
[WHY?  1/rij is scalar with respect to L,S, and J, thus
eigenenergies are independent of ML, MS and MJ.]
EASY because can read Lz = ∑liz and Sz = ∑siz directly from

a lot of algebra is not presented here!

* each Slater basis state gets “used up”
* first 2 eigenfunctions are in form αβ + βα → S = 1

second 2 eigenfunctions are in form αβ – βα → S = 0

prove this by applying S2 to above eigenfunctions of L2

32 - 5

Nonlecture pages were intended to show that applying L2 and S2 to Slater
determinants is laborious — much moreso than Lz and Sz.

This is one reason why we use the “crossing out ML, MS microstates” method
to figure out which L,S states must be considered.  Often this is sufficient —
or can be the basis for some shortcut tricks!

ML, MS method works because:
* each configuration generates the full (2L + 1) (2S + 1) manifold of ML, MS
states associated with a  given L,S term.  Why?  If you have one |MLMS〉
you can generate all of the others using L± and S± operators.
* This must be true because, starting with ML = L, MS = S, L– and S– can be
used to generate the full L,S term without the need to go outside the
specific configuration.

Slaters
for f2

need not include MS < 0 or ML < 0 because these are identical to the
 ML > 0 and MS > 0 quadrant.

Notice that as you go down in ML, the number of Slater determinants in
each ML, MS box increases only by one.  This is a prerequisite for using
the L– plus orthogonality method!  This useful simplicity does not occur
as you go down a column in MS.

This convenient situation does not occur for d3 or f3.  Why?  Because there
are more than one L-S term of a given symmetry.

Since there is only one Slater determinant in the ML = 5, MS = 1 box, generate
all triplets by repeated application of L– to ||3α2α|| (plus orthogonality) and
generate all singlets by L– on
||3α3β||.  Many orthogonalization steps needed!  Especially for singlets.

Use this to generate all triplets by applying L– repeatedly and using
orthogonality when necessary.  Note that # of determinants in each ML,MS=1

Again, as L– takes us to successively lower ML boxes, # of determinants
increases in steps of 1.  But some of these steps are due to triplets with MS = 0.
Need to step triplets down into MS = 0 territory using S– once.  Lots more
orthogonality steps, lots more trails being followed.  AWFUL, but do-able.

2. Failure and Inconvenience of ladder method
The ladder method is OK when you have a single target
state, especially when it is near an edge of the ML,MS box
diagram.  Essential that # of Slater determinants in each MLMS
box increases in steps of 1 as you step down in ML or MS.

LM SML

S

Fails when there are 2 L-S terms of same L and S in a given configuration
— must set up 2 × 2 secular equation anyway.

3. L2 and S2 Matrix Method
Another method is based on constructing L2 and S2 matrices in
the Slater determinantal basis set.  This is no cakewalk either!

Since usually SMAX << LMAX for a configuration, it is best to start with S2
because it is simpler.
