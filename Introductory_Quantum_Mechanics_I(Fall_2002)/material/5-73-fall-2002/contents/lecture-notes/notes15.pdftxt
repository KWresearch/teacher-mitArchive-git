Our initial goal is to re-express the Morse potential in terms of ω and ωx rather than
D and α.  Then we will expand VMORSE in a Taylor series and look at the coefficient of
the x3 term.  First we must take derivatives of Ev with respect to  v ≡ n + 1/2

numerical factor (2 vs. 3.75)

One reason that the result from second-order perturbation theory applied
directly to V(x) = kx2/2 + ax3 and the term-by-term comparison of the power
series expansion of the Morse oscillator are not identical is that contributions
are neglected from higher derivatives of the Morse potential to the (n + 1/2)2
term in the energy level expression.  In particular
