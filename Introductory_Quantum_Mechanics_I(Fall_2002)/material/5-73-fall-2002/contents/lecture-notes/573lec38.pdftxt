ϕ

Variational wavefunction.  Minimize E.

0 = cq (E0 – E) – A(cq–1 + cq+1)

∞ # of coupled equations

Usually solve for {cq} by setting determinant of coefficients = 0
and solving for E.  Can’t do this because determinant is ∞.

TRICK:

expect equal probability of finding e– on each lattice site by analogy to
plane wave eikx, where probability density is uniform at all sites along x,
try

cq = eikql

xq = ql

integer

distance between lattice sites

Notice that this is similar to free particle eikx, which seems rather strange because
particle is never really free in “tight-binding” model.

wavefunction is unchanged!
So if k goes outside 1st Brillouin Zone, get same ψ, so get same E
nothing new!
No point in allowing k to vary more widely than –π/l  ≤  k ≤  π /l .

2.

What happens at E > E0 + 2A?

3.

Orbitals not states!  Two spin-orbitals per orbital.

Antisymmetrization.
Lowest band:  all spins paired.  No G term.
e– – e– repulsion raises overall E above that of single state
of each atom
Work function is smaller than single atom IP

4.

How many e– does each atom contribute to ψ?

alkali: 1e– ∅ half full band
alkaline earth:  2e–∅ full band
