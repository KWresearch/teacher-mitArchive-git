On pages 16-5 through 16-11 I worked out how a block of Heff is corrected so that
“out-of-block” off-diagonal matrix elements can be safely ignored.  These
corrections come in two forms:

(i)

Second-order p erturbation theory  corrections to diag onal matrix
elements.  One  example is the “x–k” relationship s by which the  xij
vibrational anharmonicity  constants are  evaluated in  terms of
third and f ourth derivative s of V(Q).

(ii) Van Vleck transformation  of “quasi-deg enerate” or “resonan t”
blocks of Heff.  Something analogous to second-order perturbation
theory is used  to fold out-of-block off-diagonal matrix el ements
into polyad blocks along th e diagonal o f H.  These corrections
occur both on and off the d iagonal within these quasi-degenerate
polyad block s.  “Resonance” i s not accidental.  Once it appea rs it
affects larger and larger groups of near-deg enerate basis states .

H =

Consider the f ollowing 3 × 3 example of a Van Vleck transformed Heff:

This H has a 2 ↔2 quasidegenerate block and both
members of this block interact weakly with a non-
quasidegenerate remote state.

Volume I, K. Narahari Rao, and C. Weldon Mathews, Academic, 1972.

Second-order perturbation theory is used to derive the famous “x-k” relationships,
namely the relationship between the second, third, and fourth derivatives of V(Q)
