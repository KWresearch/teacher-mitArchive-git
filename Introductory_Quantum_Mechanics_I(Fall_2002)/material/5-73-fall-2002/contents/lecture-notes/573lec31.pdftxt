Goal: make inconvenience of Slater determinants almost vanish — matrix

products of spin-orbitals.

(Here the electron names match in each bra-ket but the spin-orbitals do not

Think of a one- or two-e– operator as a scheme for dealing with or “hiding” the
small number of mismatched spin-orbitals.

C. G(i,j) : 4 cases
1.  differ by more than 2 spin-orbitals:  Matrix Element → 0
2.  differ by 2 spin-orbitals: one pair of nonzero matrix elements
3.  differ by 1 spin-orbital: sum over pairs of nonzero matrix elements
4.  expectation value : differ by 0 spin-orbitals: double sum over pairs of
matrix elements
1.  is obvious — only way to make up for orbital mismatch is to hide the
mismatched orbitals in 〈|g(i,j)|〉 (rather than in an overlap integral).  But one
can only hide 2-mis-matched pairs in, e.g.

unexpected: consequence
of antisymmetrization

updated September 19,

5.73 Lecture #31

31 - 7

The ONLY real surprise that results from the antisymmetrization requirement
for two-electron operators is one extra term (and some signs) that has no
counterpart if antisymmetrization had been ignored.

SUMMARY
* antisymmetrize → Slater determinants
* matrix elements are hardly more complicated than those of simple spin-
orbital products
•signs due to permutation [Standard order]
•extra terms in G(i,j)

Do some examples for p2

1. What L,S terms belong to p2 (Lecture #32:  method of crossing out microstates)
2. What is the correct linear combination of Slater determinants that corresponds to
a specific L-S term in either the JLSMJ〉 or the LMLSMS〉 basis set
•ladders plus orthogonality (Lecture #32)
•L2 and S2 matrices
•3-j coefficients
