If µl > 0, this corresponds to an advance of the phase of ul(ν,r)
relative to that for H.  As expected, ψ is sucked into core by an
amount πµl [+ an arbitrary number of 2π’s] by the Z(r) core.

πµl is the phase shift that occurs inside the core.  It is the
boundary condition at r = 0 shifted out to r = r0.  On the other
hand, the r → ∞ b.c.  is satisfied by ν = n – µl where n is integer.
