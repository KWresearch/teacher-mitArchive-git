OK to set up H in either basis 

problem about HZeeman  in Coupled Basis → need to work out explicit transformation 
between basis sets to evaluate matrix elements of HZeeman  in coupled basis. 

Today: 

1.  Ladders and Orthogonality method for JLSMJ〉 ↔ LMLSMS〉 
(coupled↔uncoupled) transformation, term by term. 

2. 

evaluate HZeeman  in coupled basis for 2P state. 

3.  Correlation Diagram, Noncrossing Rule 
* simple patterns without calculations 
* guidance for “intermediate case” 

War between two limits 
* one term creates ∆E ( )  ≠ 0
0
ij 
* other term causes H ( )  ≠ 0
1
ij 
The two terms play opposite roles in the two basis sets. 

4.  Stepwise picture of level structure working out from 2 opposite limits 
* strong spin-orbit, weak Zeeman 
* strong Zeeman, weak spin-orbit 
Distortions from limiting patterns (via 2nd-order nondegenerate perturbation 
theory) give the “other” (pattern distorting) parameter. 
How does a zero-order picture identify the “picture defining” and the “picture 
destroying parameters.
