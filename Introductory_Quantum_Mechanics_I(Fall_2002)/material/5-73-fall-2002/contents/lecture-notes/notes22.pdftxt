This vector cross product definition of L is more general than q × p because there
is no way to define spin in q × p form but S × S = ihS is quite meaningful.

Can one generalize that, if L × L = ihL (instead of 0), and the [Li, Lj] and [Li, pj]
commutation rules have similar forms, that L × p = ihp?  NO!  Check for yourself!
