This suggests (based on what we know from classical mechanics about momentum)
that if k > 0 something is “moving” to right (+x direction) and if k < 0 moving to left

How do we really know that something is moving?  We need to resort to time
dependent Schr. Eqn.

A,B determined by specific boundary conditions.

• Can’t really see any motion unless we go to time dependent Schr. Eq.

• Need superposition of +k and –k parts to get wiggles.
• Wiggles = superpositon of waves with different values of k

                 = another kind of superposition (wave packet)
• Motion becomes really clear when we do two things:
* time dependent Ψ(x,t)

* create localized states called wavepackets by superimposing several eikx with
different |k|’s.
