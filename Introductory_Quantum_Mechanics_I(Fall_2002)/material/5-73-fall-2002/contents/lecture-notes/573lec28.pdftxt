Hydrogen Radial Wavefunctions

The Hydrogen atom is special because it has electronic states and properties that scale
with n and l in a simple and global way.  This is “structure” that is more than a
collection of unrelated facts.  H serves as our model for “electronic structure” of many-
electron atoms, molecules, and possibly solids.

By showing how E, 〈rσ〉 (size and shapes), 〈nl|r|n′l ′〉 (general matrix element) scale
with n and l, it tells us the kind of behavior to look for in more complex systems.

* as a perturbation on H (quantum defects)
* as a hint of relationships useful for extrapolation, assignment,
for recognizing when something behaves differently from naive
expectations.

so we can take   Y m
a 1-D radial equation where the only trace of the angular part is the
l -dependence of Vl (r), the effective potential energy function.

Since the differential equation depends on l, R(r) must also depend on l,
thus  Rnl (r) is the radial part of ψ, and it will generally be an explicit
function of    two      quantum  numbers,  n  and  l.

Usually n  specifies  the number of  radial nodes and  l  the  number  of  angular
nodes,  but  a  special  numbering  convention  for Hydrogen  (and  hydrogenic
ions) causes a slight distortion of this rule.

Return to special situation as r → 0.
Why do we care?  It turns out that s-orbitals have Rns(0) ≠ 0 and that in ESR
one measures “Fermi-contact” hyperfine structure which is the spin-density
at specific nuclei.  It is a direct measure of the ns atomic orbital character
in each molecular orbital!
CTDL, p. 781

What is the worst possible divergence of Rnl(r) as r → 0?
For r → 0, Rnl(r) will be dominated by rs where |s| is as small as
possible.  This is the most strongly divergent part of Rnl(r), which
is all we need to be concerned with as r → 0.
Let Rnl ~ Crs, where this is a good approximation at r → 0.
Plug this definition into Schrödinger Equation
