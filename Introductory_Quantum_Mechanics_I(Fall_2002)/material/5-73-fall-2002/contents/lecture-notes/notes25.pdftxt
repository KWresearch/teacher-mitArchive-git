2. Dimension of basis sets JLSMJ

3. matrix elements of  HSO in both basis  sets
4. matrix elements of  HZeeman in both basis sets

5.

ladders and  orthogonali ty for transformation between basi s

sets.  Necessary to be able to evaluate matrix elemen ts of
HZeeman in coupled basis.  Why?  Because coupled basis set
does not expl icitly give effec ts of Lz or Sz.
