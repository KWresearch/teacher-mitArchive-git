*|g(k)|, which  is independent of time, conta ins all info about p0, ∆p. 
Therefore these quantities do n ot evolve in time  for a  free wavepacket. 
They do evolve if V(x) is n ot constant. 
Think abou t chopping up the Fourier tran sform of |Ψ(x,t)|2 into pieces 
corresponding  to different va lues of p.  If th ere is no force a cting on the 
wavepacket, th e <p> for each piece of the o riginal |Ψ(x,t)|2 remains 
constant. 

Summary 

We know how to encode a wavepacket for p0, ∆p, x0 (and sin ce ∆x is an 
explicit fun ction of time, we can let Ψ(x,t) evolve until it has the desired ∆x 
and then sh ift x0t back to the de sired location where ∆x ha s the now 
specified va lue). 

We also know how to inspect an arbitrary  Gaussian Ψ(x,t) to reveal its  x0t, 
∆x, p0t, ∆p with out evaluating any integral s.
