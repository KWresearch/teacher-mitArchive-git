So we see that the same Ψ(x,t) or ρρρρ (t) can look simple or complicated depending on
the nature of the measurement operator!  The measurement operator is designed to
be sensitive only to specific coherences (i.e. locations in ρρρρ) which oscillate at ωij.
THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE SEPARATE PREPARATION AND
OBSERVATION SO CLEANLY.

If A commutes with H (regardless of whether H is time-dependent), there
is no dynamics as far as observable A is concerned.  However, if A does not
commute with H, there can be dynamics of 〈A〉 even if both A and H are

ρρρρ is Hermitian  so can be  diagonali zed by T†ρρρρT =   . However, if ρρρρ is
time-dependent, T would have to be time-dep endent.  This

Alternatively, we might want to measure expectation value of an
operator that operates only on system 1: B(1).
To use Trace(ρρρρB) method, need concept of partial traces and
need to formally extend B to act as dummy operator on system 2.
˜B 1( ) = B 1( ) ⊗1 2( )
Several types of initial preparation are possible:
1. pure state of 1 ⊗ 2 (a “tensor product” state)
2. statistical mixture in 1, pure state in 2.
3. statistical mixture in both.
