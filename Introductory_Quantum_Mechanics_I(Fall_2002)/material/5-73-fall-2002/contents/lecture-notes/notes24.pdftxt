This is possible, but f(x,y) would have to have a form that excludes it as an
acceptable ψ(x,y).  Typically, the f(x,y) will have to be discontinuous or have
discontinuous first derivatives.  For all well behaved V(x,y), ψ(x,y) will have
continuous first derivatives.  The f(x,y) used to prove a commutation rule must
be acceptable as a quantum mechanical wavefunction, ψ(x,y).  This is a good
thing because (see Angular Momentum Handout)

This provides a basis for taking apart the dynamics of an arbitrary 2 × 2 ρρρρ into
dynamics of x, y, z fictitious spin-1/2 components.  Beat the S = 1/2  Zeeman
problem to death and use it as basis for understanding dynamics of any 2 × 2 space.

9 3 × 3 basis matrices is not nearly so nice as the 4 basis matrices for  2 × 2 problem.
But this turns out to be what is needed to “understand” and picture spin = 1 systems.

similarly for j = 3/2, 2, etc.
There are 2 lovely consequences of being able to take an arbitrary matrix and
rewrite it as sum of J matrices.
1. If M is the matrix of an operator – a term in the Hamiltonian – then it is clear
that this operator may be re-expressed as a sum of operators, each of which
behaves exactly like a (combination of) component(s) of J – evaluated in the
jm〉 basis set.
