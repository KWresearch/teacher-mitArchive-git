The reason for this rather complicated looking expansion is that it is
well suited for integrals over atomic orbitals which are expressed in
terms of ri, θ
i, φ
i, which are coordinates of the i-th e– with respect to the
center of symmetry (nucleus) rather than the other e–.  It enables use of
AO basis states.  Otherwise 1/rij integrals would be nightmares.

This seems rather laborious, but it is much easier than:
* generating each LML = L  SMS = S〉 as an explicit linear combination of Slater
determinants
then calculating matrix elements of e2/rij, because there are many nonzero off-
diagonal matrix elements between Slater determinants in the same ML,MS box.

intraconfiguration L-S term splittings

(there is NO center of Gravity Rule for degeneracy weighted L-S terms)

updated September 19,

5.73 Lecture #34
34 - 10
Now it is easy to show that all Fk’s are > 0 and Fk >> Fk+2 etc. (roughly factor of 10
per step in k)

From this we get an empirical rule

Lowest E of all L–S terms is the one with

* MAXIMUM S
*
of those with Maximum S, lowest is the one with MAXIMUM L

These are Hund’s first and second (of three) rules.

Note also that Hund’s rules do nothing about predicting the energy order of L-S terms
except for the identity of the single, lowest energy L-S term.
