TODAY:  Obtain all angular momentum matrix elements from the commutation
rule definition of an angular momentum, without ever looking at a
differential operator or a wavefuncton.  Possibilities for phase
inconsistencies.  [Similar derivation for angular parts of matrix
elements of all spherical tensor operators,     .]

The only nonzero matrix elements of Ji in the |λµ〉 basis set are those where
∆µ = 0, ±h and ∆ λ = 0.  As for derivation of Harmonic Oscillator matrix
elements, we are not assured that all µ differ in steps of h.  Divide basis states
into sets related by integer steps of h in µ.

Thus µ is either integer or half integer or both!

Thus there will at worst be only two non-communicating sets of λµ〉 because if µ
were both integer and 1/2-integer, each would form a set of µ-values, the members of
which would be separated in steps of h.
