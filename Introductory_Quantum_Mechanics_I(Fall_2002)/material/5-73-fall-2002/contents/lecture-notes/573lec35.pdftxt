A. Importance of spin-orbit

35 - 2

1. HSO produces diagnostically significant “fine structure”
CONFIGURATIONAL ASSIGNMENTS
L,S term assignments
PATTERNS:*  # components
* sign of pattern (largest splitting on top or bottom)
* statistical weight (2J + 1) of lowest vs. highest
   energy component
* overall magnitude of splitting
2. for heavy atoms, HSO responsible for such large splittings and off-
diagonal interactions that L-S terms “vanish”, ∆S selection rules
are violated.  “Inter-System Crossing (ISC)”.

Need to “deperturb” to recover Fk, Gk parameters which should
vary smoothly from atom to atom (isoelectronic series) (shielding
rules)

3. spin-forbidden transitions provide energy linkages between
manifolds of states with different values of S. “InterSystem
Crossing (ISC)”

4. non-textbook Zeeman tuning coefficients (clues about unobserved
“dark” states)

Atoms, Molecules, Quantum Dots, solids:  in an electronic transition, light
acts on single e– and operates exclusively on spatial part of ψ → spin-flips
are forbidden except when HSO mixes states of different S — forbidden
transitions “borrow” intensity from allowed transitions.  In time-domain:  a
short pulse prepares, at t = 0, a non-eigenstate that is a pure ∆S = 0
excitation (and ∆l = ±1) basis state.  The “pluck”!

Language:  the name of each eigenstate is based on dominant (i.e., “nominal”)
character.  It is the name of the dominant basis states.  Use of same name for
both eigenstate and basis state is a source of confusion.
