5.73 Lecture #33
L-S Terms via L2, S2 and Projection

33 - 1

LAST TIME:

* method of ML, MS boxes. [For 3L states, cross out boxes starting from
both (ML=L,MS=1) and (ML=L,MS=0).]
complete (2L + 1)(2S + 1) dimension for each L-S term [# of boxes]
* nl2 pattern
* (nl)2 n′l′
* method of ladders plus orthogonality

TODAY:
L2, S2 method to obtain |LMLSMS〉, especially for ML,MS boxes in which the
where method of ladders plus orthogonality is most inconvenient:  ML = 0,
MS = 0
* L2 → L+L– only for ML = 0 block.  Every L–S term is represented
in this most evil block.
set up and diagonalize S2 — easy — by forming ± linear
combinations
(singlet and triplet)
  αβ – βα       αβ + βα
transform L2 to singlet, triplet basis (block diagonalization), then
diagonalize L2 by knowing (from crossing out boxes method)
eigenvalues:   L(L + 1)
other, strong spin-orbit basis sets

*

Modern calculations use projection operators:  designed to project away all
unwanted parts of ψ yet preserve normalization.

Look at the ML = 0, MS = 0 block of f2 and construct all L – S basis states.  All
extant L-S terms of f2 are present once in the ML = MS = 0 block.  Never try to
get to this block by ladders and orthogonality!

Cute trick that works especially well in  ML = 0 and  MS = 0 blocks
because many otherwise awful terms vanish.

So for  ML = 0 block only, can replace L2 by L+L– (or L–L+) and, for
MS = 0 only, replace S2 by S+S–.

Two opposite strategies:
1.
ladder down from extreme ML, MS
2. L2 + S2 matrices are large but easy to write out for ML = 0 and MS = 0
ONLY — could then ladder up from any L2, S2 eigenfunction (no need
to use orthogonality).

with getting 2 other kinds of basis states.

Either of the two many-electron basis sets is OK for   .

The big problem for e2/rij is that it has
many off-diagonal matrix elements in the Slater
determinantal basis set.  These are extremely tedious to
evaluate.  The solution to this is the
“Slater Sum Rule” method.
It is based on the fact that the trace of a matrix is equal
to the sum of the eigenvalues.  This is true regardless of
what representation is used to express the matrix.

Alternative method to set up LMLSMS〉 or JLSMJ〉 basis sets in terms of either
nlmlsms or njωls orbital Slater basis sets.
1. Work out L2 and S2 matrices for nlmlsms (or J2 for njωls).  These matrices are
block diagonal in ML,MS (or MJ).

2. Construct an operator which, when applied to an arbitrary function, annihilates
the undesired part of that function.

3. Modify the above operator so that it preserves the amplitude of the L′
component of Ψ.

This method is useful for dealing with JMJLS〉 in the jωls〉 orbital basis because
there is no simple way of block diagonalizing J2 in terms of L2 and S2, can only
block diagonalize J2 in terms of MJ.

Modern calculations will simply set up the J2,Jz matrix, diagonalize J2, and then
discover to which eigenvalues of L2 and S2 each J2, Jz basis function belongs.  In
many cases two or more L–S terms will contain L–S–J components which belong
to the same eigenvalue of J2.
