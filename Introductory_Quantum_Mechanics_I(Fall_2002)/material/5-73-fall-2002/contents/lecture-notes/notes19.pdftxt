Let us define a quantity called “Density Matrix”
ρρ ≡ ψ ψ

a pure state

ψψψψ can be any sort of QM wavefunction
* eigenstate of H
* coherent superposition of several eigenstates of H

but ψψψψ cannot represent a statistical (i.e. incoherent) mixture of several different ψψψψ’s

However, ρρρρ  can represent a statistical (i.e. equilibrium) mixture of states

simple prescription for calculating 〈A〉

The separation between initial preparation, evolution, and
measurement of a specific observable is very convenient and
instructive.

So we see that the same Ψ(x,t) or ρρρρ (t) can look simple or complicated depending on
the nature of the measurement operator!  The measurement operator is designed to
be sensitive only to specific coherences (i.e. locations in ρρρρ) which oscillate at ωij.
THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE SEPARATE PREPARATION AND
OBSERVATION SO CLEANLY.

If A commutes with H (regardless of whether H is time-dependent), there
is no dynamics as far as observable A is concerned.  However, if A does not
