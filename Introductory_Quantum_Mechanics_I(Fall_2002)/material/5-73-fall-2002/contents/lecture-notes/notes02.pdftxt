cartoons of ψn(x):  what happens to {ψn} and {En} if
we move well:

left or right in x?

Infinite well was easy:  2 boundary conditions plus normalization requirement.

Generalize to stepwise constant potentials: in each V(x)=constant region,
need to know 2 complex coefficients and, if the particle is confined within a
finite range of x, there is quantization of energy.

* boundary and joining conditions
* normalization
* overall phase arbitrariness

So next step is to deal with case where boundary conditions are not so
obvious.  δ(x) well and barrier.

Since the potential has even symmetry wrt      x → –x, ψ(x) must be even or odd (not a
mixture) with respect to x → – x, thus ψ(x) = ±ψ(–x).  If ψ(x) is even, there must be a
cusp in ψ(x) at x = 0

There is a continuum of ψ’s possible for E > 0.  Since the particle
is free for E > 0, specific form of ψ must reflect specific problem:

e.g., particle probability incident from x < 0 region.  It is even
more interesting to turn this into the simplest of all barrier
scattering problems.  See Non-Lecture pp. 2-8, 9, 10.

Note that: R(E) starts at 1 at E = 0 and goes to 0 at E → ∞

T(E) starts at 0 and increases monotonically to 1 as E increases.

Note also  that, at   E = − ma2

R → ∞ as E approaches –ma2/2h2 from above and
then changes sign as E passes through –ma2/2h2 !

This is the energy of the bound state in the δ(x)-function well

problem.
