asymptotic-Airy functions have matched amplitudes (and phase) across 
validity gap straddling the turning point. 

ψJWKB  for a linear V(x) is identical to asymptotic-Airy!

 D 

C, D, and φ are determined by matching. 

These Airy functions are not normalized, but each pair has correct relative 
amplitude on opposite sides of turning point.  l-JWKB has same functional form 
as a-Airy.  This permits us to link pairs of JWKB functions across invalid region 
and then use JWKB to extend ψ(x) into regions further from turning point 
where linear approximation to V(x) is no longer valid.

(real, no oscillations) 

Note carefully that argument of exp goes to –∞ as x → − ∞, thus ψI(–∞) → 0. 
Note also that (ψI/C) increases monotonically as x increases up to x = a. 

When you a re doing matching for the first time, it is very impor tant to 
verify that the phase of ψ varies with x  in the way you want it to.

The first zero is located at an accumulated phase of (3/4)π  inside x=a because 
(3/4 + 1/4)π = π and sin π = 0. 

It does not matter that ψIIa is invalid near x = a, x = b 
Note that phase increases as x increases - as it must.  The π/4 is the extra phase 
required by the AIRY splice across I,II.  It reflects the tunneling of ψ(x) into the 
forbidden region. 
PHASE starts at π/4 in classical region and always increases as one moves 
(further into classical region) away from turning point.  NEVER FORGET!
