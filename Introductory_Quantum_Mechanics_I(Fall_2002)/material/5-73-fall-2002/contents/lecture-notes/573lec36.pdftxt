 vs. 
     e

(holes are a convenience in spectra of isolated atoms and
molecules, but they are an essential part of the
interpretive picture for solids)

2. Hund’s 3rd rule

3. Zeeman effect:  Landé g-factor formula via W-E Theorem
(done previously by projection theorem)

4. Matrix elements of HZeeman in Slater determinantal basis
set.  No difference between electron and hole as far as
Zeeman effect is concerned.

is the sign flip just a coincidence?  NO!

TRICK:  Hole is exactly equivalent to e– (for identical LMLSMS or JLSMJ)
except that the sign of its charge is reversed.

* no effect on e2/rij because 2 interacting particles have charge of the
same sign (either both e– or both hole), so e2/rij is always a
repulsive interaction.  [What happens for f13p?  Certainly different
from fp!]

*

reverse sign for HSO because HSO is a relativistic electrostatic
interaction between e– and nucleus (+ charge).  Replacing e– by h+
and leaving the sign on the nucleus the same reverses the sign of
HSO!

* gJ decreases at constant J when S is replaced by L.
* gJ decreases at  constant L and S as J decreases from L+S to |L–S|.

How to determine J:
* apply B-field and count MJ components
(constant splittings in upper and in lower L-S term)

* measure gJ (Quantum Beats)

* polarization dependent Zeeman splitting pattern:  ∆MJ = 0 for z
polarized, ∆MJ = ±1 for x or y polarized, ∆MJ = +1 or –1 for circularly
polarized
