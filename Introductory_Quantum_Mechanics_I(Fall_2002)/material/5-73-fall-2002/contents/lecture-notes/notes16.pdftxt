One reason that the result from second-order perturbation theory applied
directly to V(x) = kx2/2 + ax3 and the term-by-term comparison of the power
series expansion of the Morse oscillator are not identical is that contributions
are neglected from higher derivatives of the Morse potential to the (n + 1/2)2
term in the energy level expression.  In particular
