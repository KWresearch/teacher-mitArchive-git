The following problem is one of my “patented” magical mystery tours.  It is a very 
long problem which absolutely demands the use of a computer for parts F and G. 
There are many separate computer programs that you will need to write for this 
problem.  I urge you to divide the labor into smaller groups, each responsible for a 
different piece of programming.  I believe that the insights you will obtain from 
working together on this problem will be more than worth the effort expended. 

Consider the simplest possible symmetric double minimum potential: 

V(x) = aδ(x)  a > 0 
V(x) = ∞ 

–L/2 < x < L/2 
|x| ≥ L/2.

B.	

Solve for all of the eigenstates and eigen-energies for states that have odd 
reflection symmetry about x = 0.  (This part of the problem is very easy.) 

Solve for the energy eigenstates and eigen-energies for the 5 lowest energy 
even-symmetry states.  Choose a  = 400h2/Lm.  I suggest you use trial 
functions of form 

ψ
ψ

n(x) = N sin[kn(x + L/2)] 
n(x) = –N sin[k
n(x – L/2)] 

–L/2 ≤ x < 0 
0 < x ≤ L/2

One way to find the eigen-energies is to plot the quantities y = tan(kL/2) and 
y = –kL/400 and to determine eigen-energies from the k-values at 
intersections.  Each En (odd n, even symmetry) is located at an intersection. 
Note there will be exactly one value of En below the lowest odd-symmetry 
eigenstate (E2) and one value of En between each consecutive pair of odd-
symmetry eigenstates. 

C. 

For an ordinary infinite square well. the ratio of the spacing between the two 
lowest levels to that between the two lowest odd–symmetry levels, is 

R21;42  ≡ 

E2  − E1
E4  − E2 

= 

−  = 
4 1   3
16 − 4  12 

= 0 25 
.
.

For your double minimum potential, this level spacing ratio will decrease 
from 0.25 at a = 0 toward 0 as a increases.  For the value of a that I 
suggested, this ratio should be about 0.003. 

Repeat the calculation of R21;42 for E1 using a-values a factor of 3 and 9 
smaller than the one you decided on above. 

Suggest a functional relationship between a and R21;42. 

D . 

The ratio 

R43;42 = 7/12 

for an ordinary infinite square well.  Is the E4-E3
spacing you obtained for 
a = 400h2/Lm larger or smaller than E
2–E1?  Why?

What does this suggest about the possibility of creating a state localized on 
the left or right side of the well?
