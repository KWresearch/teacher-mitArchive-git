d  orbitals  are  often  labeled  xy, xz, yz, z2, x2–y2.   These  labels  are Cartesian  tensor
components.  Find the linear combinations of binary products of x, y, and z that may be

      Angular Momenta     

Consider a two-electron atom  in the “electronic  configuration” 3d4p.   The electronic states that
belong  to  this configuration are  3F, 1F, 3D, 1D, 3P, and 1P.   There are (2l
1 + 1)  (2l
2 + 1)  (2s1 + 1)
(2s2 + 1) = 60 spin-orbital occupancies associated with this configuration.  I am going to ask you
to solve several angular momentum coupling problems, using 3-j coefficients and the Wigner-
Eckart Theorem for states belonging to this configuration.  However, I do not expect you to
consider  the anti-symmetrization requirement  that  is  the subject of  lectures #30  - 36.

Spin-orbitals  in  the uncoupled basis set are denoted by nlmlsms(i) where n  is the principal
quantum number and i specifies the name of the assumed-distinguishable electron.  Since s = 1/2
for all electrons, we can use an abbreviated notation for spin-orbitals:   lλα/β where α
corresponds to ms = +1/2 and β to ms = –1/2.  The two-electron basis states are denoted

Use  3-j  coefficients  to derive  the  linear  combination of  six  spin-orbital occupancies  that
corresponds to the   3P0 MJ = 0〉   state.  The six basis states are    3–1α 11β〉,  3–1β 11α〉,
 30α 10β〉,  30β 10α〉,  31α 1-1β〉, and  31β 1-1α〉.   Note  that you will have  to perform
three uncoupled→coupled transformations:

and

I advise against using ladders plus orthogonality to solve this problem because MJ = 0 is
the worst  possible  situation  for  this method.

B .

The atom in question has a nonzero nuclear spin, I = 5/2.  This means that you will
eventually have to perform one more uncoupled to coupled transformation:

cJLS is a constant that depends on each of the magnitude quantum numbers J, L, and S (but

The purpose  of  this problem  is  to  show  that  all  of  the  fine  (spin-orbit)  and hyperfine
structure  for all of  the states of  the 3d4p configuration can be related  to  the
fundamental one-electron coupling constants:  a3d, a4p, b3d, b4p, ζ
3d, and ζ
4p.
Derive  simple  formulas  for  the hyperfine and  fine  structure  for all   FJLSIMF
〉 states of
the 3d4p configuration (consistent with neglect of ∆L ≠ 0, ∆S ≠ 0 matrix elements).

C .

The  six L–S  states  that  arise  from  the  3d4p  electronic  configuration  split  into  12  fine-
structure J-components and, in turn, into 54 hyperfine F-components.  The eigenenergies
are  given  (neglecting  off-diagonal matrix  elements  between widely  separated  J-L-S  fine
structure components) by cJLSJ•I and, alternatively, by matrix elements of the
microscopic  forms of  the Hhf (and HSO) operators evaluated  in  the explicit product-of-
spin-orbitals basis set.   The set of 12 {cJLS} can be related to four of the six fundamental
coupling constants  listed at the end of part B.   There are several tricks for expressing
many-electron reduced matrix elements in terms of one-electron reduced matrix
elements.   One  trick  is  to start with “extreme  states”.   Another  is  to exploit a matrix
element sum rule based on the trace invariance of matrix representations of H.  For HSO
use 3F4 MJ = 4 to get ζ
, 3P0 MJ = 0 (your answer to part A) to get ζ
, and (if you are brave:
3F
3P
opt iona l    ) the sum rule for J = 3, MJ = 3 to get ζ
.  For Hhf consider only 3F4 MF = (4+5/2)
3D
and (if you are brave:      opt iona l    ) 1F3 MF = (3 + 5/2).
