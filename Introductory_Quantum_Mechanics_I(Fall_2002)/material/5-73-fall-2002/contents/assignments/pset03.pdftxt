Problems: 

1 .  

Airy Functions,  piecewise  linear  potentials 

For  the  following  5 potentials,  find  the energies of  the 5  lowest energy eigenstates.

values,  as needed to make computer programs work,  for all unspecified constants (m, L).

(optional) F .  Compare the energies from parts A and B and discuss in terms of “tunneling”. 

G.	 Compare the energies from parts C, D, and E to the energies of an ordinary infinite box, 
V(x) = ∞ for |x| > L/2, V(x) = 0 for |x| ≤ L/2.  All three boxes have the same average 
depth.  If  the  energies  are  not  identical,  explain.  If  they  are  identical,  perhaps  the 
WKB  quantization  condition  (even  though  it  is  inapplicable  here  for  several  reasons), 
applied  at  E  =  CL/2, will  provide  an  explanation. 
[HINT:  Box D is a symmetric double minimum potential, unlike boxes E and F.] 

(optional) H .	 Return to the potential of part B and choose a < 0.  Consider only the lowest energy 
level.  Is  there  any value of  a  for which  the  energy  of  the  lowest  energy  level  does  not 
fall below E = 0?  Is there any value of a  for which more  than one  level has E  <  0?  [The  
second part requires no calculation, only words.] 
Consider  the  two-δ-function  potential: 

2 . 

V(x) = ∞ 

|x| > L/2 

V(x) = –a[δ(x–L/6) + δ(x+L/6)]. 

A .  List all of  the  (–L/2, L/2)  infinite box eigenstates  that have nodes at x = ±L/6.  Give  the 

general expression  for  the energies of  these special states  in  the  two-δ-function 

po ten t ia l .  

B .  The states  that do not have nodes at x = ±L/6 will come  in  two  flavors,  those with 

ψ(–L/6) = ψ(L/6)≠0 and those with ψ(–L/6) = –ψ(L/6)≠0.  It is possible that one of these 

Chemistry  5.73

flavors will have  to be  treated as  two separate sub-flavors, ψ(|x| = L/6) > 0 and 

ψ (|x| =  L/6)  <  0.  Without  doing  any  calculations  at  all,  predict  whether  each  of  the 

flavors  of  states  is  shifted  to  higher  or  lower  energy  than  the  ordinary  infinite  box 

states.  Also, are  the energy shifts of  the  two sub-flavors of ψ(–L/6) = ψ(L/6)  states 

id en t i ca l ?  

j, where ψ
[HINT:  What do you know about the energy of eiφψ
j is an eigenstate of H?] 

C .  As a  increases  from  zero,  first  there will be one  eigenstate with E < 0  and  then  there 

will be  two.  To which  flavor of state does  the unique E < 0 eigenstate belong at small 

a?  When  there  are  two  E < 0  eigenstates,  to which  flavor(s) do  they  belong?  Does  the 

lowest  energy  state  always belong  to  the  same  flavor of  state  for  all values of  a?  Can 

there  ever  be more  than  two E < 0  eigenstates  at  very  large  a? 

[HINT:  All of these questions can be answered without doing any numerical 

calculation .] 

(optional) D .	 Solve for the energies of the ten states with 0 through 9  internal nodes.  Construct a 

“correlation  diagram”  that  shows how  the energies of  these  states evolve  from 

a = 0 to a = ∞. 

E n(a  = 0) 

En(a = ∞)

(optional) E .  Speculate about  the  form of  the  level diagram  for a →  –∞?  Would  it be reasonable  to 

take  the 0 ≤ a  < ∞  correlation diagram  and  extend  it  by  naïve  extrapolation  to  a  two-

sided  correlation  diagram: 

E(a  =  –∞) 

E(a  =  0) 

E(a  =  +∞) .  

3 .  

WKB  Quantization 

Consider  the Lennard-Jones potential: 
−  σ  6  
 σ  12 
 x   
 x 
Let ε = 100, m = 100, σ = 1, h  = 1, and h = 2π. 

ε 
( )  = +  4ε
V x  

A .  What  is  the  value  of  V(x)  at  the minimum  of  the  potential  (when 

dV  
d x   =0)? 

B .	 What  is  the  difference  in  energy  between  V(xmin)  and V(∞)?  This  is  called  the 
dissociation  energy, De. 

C .  Use WKB quantization to determine the total number of  levels bound in V(x).  This (not 
necessarily integer) number is vD.  [Hint:  ED  = V(∞), solve for x–(ED).] 

D .  The  classical  period  of  oscillation  is  h 

d n  
d E  .  Use the d/dE form of the WKB quantization 
condition to determine dn/dE.  Compute the oscillation period for the 3 integer values of 
vD  just below the (noninteger) vD.  [It may be necessary to resort to numerical rather than 
analytic  integration.] 

E .	 Estimate  the  locations  of  the  first  interior  node  just  to  the  right of  x–(E)  and  just  to  the 
left of  x+(E)  for  the  three  vibrational  levels  in  part  D.  [Hint:  WKB wavefunctions 
start with phase π/4 at turning point and the phase increases as one moves away from 
the turning point into the classical region.  The first node occurs at an accumulated 
phase of 3π/4.] 

F .  Calculate,  using  classical  mechanics,  the  time  it  takes  for  a  classical  particle  to move 
dV
from  x±(E)  to  the  first  internal node.  Recall  that Force = – d x  .  It is a good 
approximation  here  to  treat  V(x)  as  linear with  slope  equal  to  the  slope  at  x±(E).  Do 
this calculation  for  the  inner and outer  turning point regions  for each of  the  three  levels 
you considered in part D.

G.	 What  fraction of  the oscillation period does  the system spend  in  the outermost  lobe of 
the vibrational wavefunction?  [More correct  language would be:  “What  is  the 
probability of  finding  the system within  the specified  range of x?”]  In  the  innermost 
lobe?  What  is  the  ratio of  times  [or more correctly, probabilities]  in  these  two  lobes  for 
the  three highest vibrational  levels?  You are supposed  to be surprised by  the result you 
obtain .  

H .	 Suggest an explanation, based entirely on your answer to part G, for why the long-range 
expression 
( 
D v D 

− v ) 3  =  E v D 

− E v ,

where D is a constant, can be determined entirely by the x–6  dependence of the 
attractive  limb  of  the  potential  and  be  totally  insensitive  to  the  nature  of  the  x–12  
dependent repulsive limb.  Does the value you obtain for D satisfy Le Roy’s long range 
theory  for a C6R–6  long-range  potential?
