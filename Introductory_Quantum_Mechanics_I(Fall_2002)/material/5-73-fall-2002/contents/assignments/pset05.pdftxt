Problem  Set  #5 

DUE:  At  the start of Lecture on Friday, October 18. 

Problems: 

1 . 

A . 

Use the a, a†  algebra  introduced at the end of Lecture #13 to organize the matrix 
elements of x3 and x4 according to selection rules: 

3xn| |n + 3 
3xn| |n + 1 
4xn| |n + 4 
4xn| |n + 2

E v  
where  ω
eye  are  traditional  vibrational  constants.  Express  E0, ω
e, ω
exe, and ω
e, 
ω
exe, and ω
eye  in terms of m, k, a, and b.  This  is an extremely complicated and 
tedious algebraic nightmare.  Maybe you can get your computer to do the 
a lgebra .

You are going to approach the following potential energy curve using a variety of 
methods,  including  the Discrete Variable  representation  (DVR)  and  Perturbation 
Theory: 

V(x) = kx2/2 – |a|x3 + |b|x4. 

When |a| >  [(16/9)k|b|]1/2, V(x) has two minima, at 

xmin1  = 0 

[V(0) = 0] 

and 

xmin 2 

=

.

When |a| < [(16/9)k|b|]1/2 the second minimum disappears.  Let 

m = 1.000 × 10–2 
k = 1.000 × 104 
|a| = 1980 
|b| = 200 
in  appropriate  units.

C . 

Find  the energy of  the  local maximum of V(x),  V(xmax), and use  the WKB 
quantization condition to find the total number of bound levels at energy below 
the  top  of  the  potential  hump.  Also use WKB  quantization  to  estimate  the 
number  of  levels  that  the  inner  well  alone would  bind  at  E  ≤  V(xmax) .  

Use DVR  to  solve  for  the energies of  the  lowest n  levels of  this well, where n  is 
twice the total number of levels bound below V(xmax).  Use a 500 × 500 x matrix. 

Use the expectation value of x to apportion the levels you found below V(xmax) 
into  those bound primarily  in  the  left  (deeper) well and  those bound  in  the 
right  (shallower) well.  Note  that  you  can use  the  eigenvectors  from DVR 
(because  these  are  expressed  in  the  harmonic  oscillator  basis  set)  to  calculate 
x  for  each  eigenstate. 

D .	

Fit  the 5  lowest energies of  those  levels  that you  found  in part C  to be  localized 
in the  left (deeper) well to a power series  in v  +  1/2

where  ω
e, ω
exe,  and ω
eye  are  the  traditional  names  for  the  vibrational 
expansion  coefficients.  Note  that  if  you  had  attempted  to  fit  all   of the energy 
levels below V(xmax) to this sort of power series, you would have required many 
more constants  to obtain an acceptable  fit and  the  fitted values of ω
e, ω
exe, and 
ω
eye  would not agree well with  the values  from perturbation  theory. 

E . 

Compare the results you obtained in 1B to those you obtained in 2D.

Before you derive  the second-order corrections  to all of  the energy  levels  it  is 
necessary to consider the selection rules on  n H ( )  m  .  What  are  these  selection

rules?

sign of a? 

Use perturbation theory to address the question of when there will be zero and 
when  there will be only one  level at E < 0. 

Reconsider the two-sided correlation diagram proposed in 2E of Problem Set #3. 
Show  that,  for  the  three  classes  of  levels,  the  energy  levels  are  described  by

For which classes of  levels  is An  = 0?  For which classes of levels is Bn  = 0?
