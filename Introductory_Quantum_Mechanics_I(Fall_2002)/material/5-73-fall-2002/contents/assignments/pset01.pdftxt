This question is based on Figure 1 of Complement JI CTDL p84.  This is a problem that 
involves many repeated calculations; thus it is best done using a computer.  Since 
computers like pure numbers, it is convenient to express the problem in dimensionless 
quantities  and  then,  if necessary,  express  the  final  result  in  the appropriate units.  One 
very effective and widely used way to do this is to use “atomic units”: 

mass = m e 
charge = e 
= 1a0 
length
action  = h /2 π = h 
energy = E h 

mass of electron 
charge of electron 
(Boh
r radius) 
(energy times time or length times momentum) 
(1 Hartree) 

Every dimensioned quantity, Q, in an equation is converted to a pure number by dividing 
it by  the  appropriate  atomic unit quantity  (expressed  in  the  same units  as  the quantity 
of  interest), denoted by: 

= 
√Q Q  /Q  (atomic unit)
√m = m /m e 
√q = q /e 
√x =  x /a0

Convert this simple Gaussian in  x√ to a Gaussian wavepacket in  k√  which  is  localized  at 
= 10 ∆x√0  to  the  left of  the barrier.  To get a  sense of how  this Gaussian wavepacket

scatters off of  the potential  step you would  ideally make a movie of  Ψ( √, √) 2 
vs.  x√

Now use your “movie” results to answer the following questions about the wavepacket 
incident on a step. 

B .	 What  is  happening  in part C  of Figure  1?  What  are  the  fringes  at  x <  0?  Why  are 
there no fringes at x > 0?  What change in E and/or m would cause the fringe spacing to 
double?  What  controls  the modulation depth  (define  this  any way you  think 
reasonable)  of  the  fringes? 

C .  What  is  happening  in  part  D  of  the  figure?  What  controls  the  relative  areas  of  the 
two peaks?  Are  there any  resonances  in  the  ratio of  the areas of  the  transmitted and 
reflected peaks?  If  there are no resonances, why not?  If there  is a resonance, what 
feature  of  the  potential  is  responsible  for  it? 

D .	 The  left  and  right  peaks  in  part D  have  different widths  and  are  centered  at  different 
distances from x = 0.  Why?

E .	 Suppose you know that there  is a step barrier but not where  it  is or how high  it  is. 
Describe the experiments you would do to determine the distance from x0  to the barrier 
and  the  actual  value  of V0. 

F .  How would you expect scattering from an infinite length step: 

V(x) = 0 
V(x)  = V0 

x < 0 
x ≥ 0 

and  a  finite  length  symmetric  step: 

V(x) = 0 
V(x)  = V0 

x < 0, x > x0 
0 ≤ x ≤ x0 

to  differ?  What  is  the most  salient  distinguishing  feature  of  the  scattering?  How 
would you determine the height and length of the finite step in the minimum number of 
observations?  If the step is not symmetric 

V(x) = 0 
V(x)  = V0 
V(x) = V0/2 

x < 0 
0 ≤ x ≤ x0 
x > x0  , 

how would you experimentally distinguish the non-symmetric step from the symmetric 
step?
