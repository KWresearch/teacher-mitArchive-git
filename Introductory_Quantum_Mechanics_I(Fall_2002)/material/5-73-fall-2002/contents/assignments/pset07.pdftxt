It  is common  to  talk about  the  time evolution as  if  the system  is moving  in  state  space  (as 
opposed  to coordinate  space) back and  forth between  the Bright and Dark  states. 

G.	

Suppose you could make some sort of magical change in the experimental apparatus so that the 
original  Bright  state  is  still  excited  at  t  =  0  but  that  the  detector  operator  now  exclusively 
“sees”  the original dark state.  How does  this alter  the  form of D and 〈D〉 and  the amplitude 
and phase of the quantum beats?

Consider  a  molecule  with  two  identical  anharmonic  local R-H  stretch  oscillators.  The  two  local

Since ω
R = ω and xLL  = xRR  = x and xLR  = 0, the two local oscillators are identical.  Thus the energy

levels (and basis sets) are arranged in polyads where the polyad quantum number, P, is

The selection rule for H(1) is ∆nL  = ±1, ∆nR  = ±1, and the intrapolyad selection rule is ∆nL  = –∆nR  = ±1. 
If we treat qL  and qR  as dimensionless,  then ω, x, and kLR  all have  the same units.  All parts of  the 
following problem are to be based on [ω = 1000, m = 1, x = 10, and kLR = 1] or [ω = 1000, m = 1, x = 1, 
kLR = 10].  The first set of parameters is close to the normal mode limit and the second set of parameters 
is  close  to  the  local mode  limit.

Set up the 11 × 11 P = 10 polyad.  Solve for the energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  Do this 
twice, once  for each of  the  two parameter  sets, above.  Give an energy  level diagram where all 
11  energy  states  are  shown on  the  same diagram.  Specify  the basis  state  (and  its  fractional 
character)  that  has  the  largest  fractional  character  in  each  eigenstate.  Are  there  any 
surprising  features?

What does  this  tell  you  about  the  transition  from  the  local mode  limiting  case  to  the normal 
mode limiting case?  In particular, does x << kLR  favor the normal mode or  local mode  limit?
