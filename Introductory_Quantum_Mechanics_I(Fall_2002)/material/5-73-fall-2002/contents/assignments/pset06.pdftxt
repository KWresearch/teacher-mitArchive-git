Problems:

You are going to derive the “x–k” relationships given on pages 17-4 and 17-5.

You have worked out the relationships between m, k, a, and b in

anharmonically coupled, anharmonic oscillators in an N-atom polyatomic

molecule.  The only thing that is different is that there are many more terms in
H(1) and the  E n
( )2  terms involve short summations over several combinations of

oscillators.  In all of your derivations ignore the

The first term in the equation for xii on page 17-4 comes from one of the
two strictly diagonal matrix elements of H(1).  These are the ∆ni = 0 matrix

The second term in xii comes from matrix elements of terms like  q qi
s
There are several classes of such matrix elements:  (∆ni, ∆ns) = (1,0),
(–1,0), (1,2), (1,–2), (–1,2), and (–1,–2).  The first two have only ± ω
i in
the denominator, while the other four have energy denominators of the
form ±ω

s.  Sum these terms and derive the second term in the xii
equation.

… (–1,–1,–1) with corresponding energy denominators.  Derive this term.

In addition to the x-k relationships by which the vibrational anharmonicity
constants, xij, are related to the cubic and quartic anharmonicity constants of the
potential surface, perturbation theory can be used to derive the relationships of the

For a polyatomic molecule, you need to know the partial derivatives of the
reciprocal moments of inertia with respect to each of the normal coordinate
displacements, and that information comes from a normal coordinate analysis (F

and G matrices) that is beyond the scope of this class.  Here, you will solve the
simpler problem of Bv = Be - α
e(v + 1/2) for a diatomic molecule.  The rotational
“constant” operator is proportional to R–2,
