Use the method of ML, MS boxes to determine the L,S “terms” that belong to the d2, d2p, and
nd2n′d electronic configurations.  Use (and explain) shortcuts to deal with the d2, d2p, and nd2n′d
configurations.

What is the total degeneracy of the d3 configuration?   Use this result to direct your guesswork  in
determining the L–S terms that belong to d3 by using your result for nd2n′d and eliminating
inappropriate  L–S  terms.

Use  the  ladders  plus  orthogonality method  to  derive  the  linear  combination  of  Slater
determinants that corresponds to the d2  3P ML = 1, MS = 0 state.

Use 3 – j coefficients to construct L = 1, ML = 1, S = 1, MS = 0 from

Use the L2, S2 method to set up the ML = 0, MS = 0 block of d2.  Find the linear combination of
Slater determinants that corresponds to 3P ML = 0, MS = 0 and then use L+ to derive 3P ML = 1,
MS = 0.

Derive the L2 matrix for ML = 3, MS = 0 of f2 shown on page 32-4.

Derive the S2 matrix for ML = 3, MS = 0 of f2.  Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Derive the four eigenvectors of the ML = 3, MS = 0 box of f2 shown on page 32-4.

Use  the  results of parts B and C  to derive  the  relationship between  the many-electron  spin-
orbit coupling constants

ζ(4f2; 3H),  ζ(4f2, 3F),  and  ζ(4f2, 3P )

[HINT:  You are going to have to apply S+ or S– to your eigenvectors.]

This is going to involve some lengthy calculations, using some combination of ladders and/or
Clebsch-Gordan algebra.   Work out  the diagonal and off-diagonal contributions of HSO to the J =
4 block (3F4, 3H4, 1G4) of f2.
Suppose, at  t = 0  the  single Slater determinant of  f2,  3 1α β  is populated.  Compute the
survival  probability  of  the  initially  formed  non-eigenstate,

  P t
( )
To solve this problem you need to work out the e2/rij energies of all L–S–J terms of f2 that are
capable of having MJ = 4  (i.e.  J ≥ 4).   You will also need diagonal and off-diagonal matrix
elements of HSO for J = 4 (3 × 3), J = 5 (1 × 1), and J = 6 (2 × 2, but this is easy).
