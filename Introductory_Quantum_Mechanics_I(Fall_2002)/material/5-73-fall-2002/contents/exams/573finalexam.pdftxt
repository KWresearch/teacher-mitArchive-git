Look at page 31-9 of the lecture notes.  Now consider the following problems of
spectrum  identification  and  prediction.

A .

You have an absorption spectrum and you do not know whether it comes from
atomic C, N, or O.  You do not have access to a table of energy levels or assigned
spectral  lines.   What  are  the  features  in  the  spectrum  that would  enable you  to
conclusively  identify  the  “ carrier ”  of  the  spectrum?

Here  are  the  rules:

a .

b.

c.

d .

e .

The atom starts out in its ground electronic state.  You cannot rely on any
state  being  initially  populated  other  than  the  lowest  L–S–J  state
predicted by Hund’ s rules.

The selection  rules  for electronic  transitions are ∆l  = ±1.  This is
consistent with ∆L = 0, ±1, ∆S = 0, ∆J = 0, ±1.   An off-diagonal matrix
element of HSO between same-configuration, same-J, ∆L = 0, ±1, ∆S = 0,
±1  states  could make weakly observable  certain ∆S ≠ 0  transitions.   The
intensity “borrowed” by a nominally  forbidden  transition  is directly
related  to  level  shifts  of  both  the  borrowing  and  lending  state.

The nuclear spins of 12C, 14N, 16O are I = 0, 1, and 0 respectively.  You can
use the presence or absence of hyperfine structure to make assignments,
but you must make some predictions about the qualitative nature of the
h f s .

You can use  the Zeeman effect  in a variety of ways  to  identify  the
states involved in a transition.  If you do so, you must calculate g-
va lues .

The Landé interval rule should prove very helpful.   If you use it, you
should  calculate  the  relative  intensities  of  transitions  to  different
J–components of an S ≠ 0, L ≠ 0 multiplet state.  The transition
intensities come  from  the  form of  the  transition operator as a 1-electron
operator, T(1)[r] where r  is  the electron coordinate.   This has ∆l  = ±1
selection  rules.    Z-polarized  light  excites  ∆ml =  0  transitions.

You should answer this question by identifying the unique spectroscopic
signature of each atom.    I am  looking  for quality  (very specific diagnostics)
rather  than  quantity  (vague,  qualitative  statements).

How would the spectra of C–, N, and O+ compare.  Make plausible
arguments about how each of the scale parameters would change.

How would the spectra of Si, P, and S compare to the spectra of C, N,
and O, respectively?  Again, be as specific (and ingenious) as you can
about how you expect all of  the scale parameters  to change.

How would you be able to tell which configuration the 4P state belongs

Effective Core Potentials (Pseudopotentials)

It is often useful to simplify a many-electron problem to a one-electron problem.  The
active  electron  moves  in  the  semi-empirically  defined  effective  potential  of  the  ion-
core.   In this problem you will use a one-dimensional ordinary differential equation
solver (Dave Lahr ’ s MATLAB® handout) to define Z eff(r) for the Ca 2+ 1S and Ca + 4s  2S ions
using the experimentally known quantum defects for the ns, np, and nd Rydberg series of
Ca+ and the 4snl  1L (l =0, 1, 2) Rydberg series of Ca.

repeat  the  iterative process  starting with a = 1.   When you are done you will
have  two pairs  of  a,b  values  that  give  the  correct  energy  for  the Ca+  8s  state.

Then use the two pairs of a,b values to compute the energy of the Ca+ 8p state
(six  internal  nodes).    Both  of  the  calculated  energies  are  likely  to  be  slightly
incorrect.   Devise  (and  explain)  an  iterative  strategy  so  that  you  can  find  a  pair

Wavepacket Dynamics in Atomic Rydberg-Land.

I am going to lead you through a simplified version of the experiment described in the
attached  paper,  “ Nonexponential Decay  of Autoionizing  Shock Wave  Packets ”  by
Thoma and Jones [Phys. Rev. Let. 83, 516 (1999)].

The purpose of this problem  is to develop the dual skills of describing the evolution of
Ψ(t) as a  specific  linear  combination of  eigenstates and of describing  the
time–dependent pictures of wavepackets in motion.

The  relevant energy  level  structure of Ca and Ca+  is  summarized  in  the  level diagram:

4dm′d

74720 cm–1
74497 cm–1

Ca+ 4p 2P1/2,3/2
318nm [Ca + 4d ← 4p] (femtosecond excitation)

4pmd

63017 cm–1
62956 cm–1

Ca+  3d 2D3/2,5/2

393nm [Ca+ 4p ← 4s] (femtosecond excitation)

49306 cm–1

Ca+ 4s 2S

49197 – 49097 cm–1

4s nd 1D2 (24 < n < 33)

393nm  (nanosecond excitation)

23652 cm–1

4s 4p 1P1

423nm (nanosecond excitation)

0 cm–1

Two nanosecond lasers are used to populate one of several 4snd 1D2 eigenstates, where
24 < n < 33.  A femtosecond laser pulse (393nm) excites the 4s electron to the 4p orbital.
The  frequency of  this  transition  is expected  to be very close  to  that of  the Ca+ 4p
2P3/2 ← 4s 2S excitation (74720 - 49306 cm–1 or 393nm).  The spectral width of the 200fs
pulse  is  sufficiently narrow  that 4p  2P1/2 ←  2S1/2  is not excited.   The excitation
probability  (because  of n–3-scaling)  for  the Rydberg  electron  is negligibly  small.   The

5.73  Final  Exam

short pulse excitation transfers the nd eigenstate from Ca 4snd to Ca 4pnd where it is
not an eigenstate.   Thus Ψ(0)  is a superposition of quasi-eigenstates

These are quasi-eigenstates because  they can decay by  “ autoionization ”   into the
continua of Ca+ 4s + εl  (l  = odd) and Ca+ 3d + ε′l ′ (l ′ = odd) via matrix elements of 1/r12.
The energies of these |4pmd〉 quasi-eigenstates can be taken to be given by a simplified

For  specificity, let 32 ≤ m ≤ 37 (six states) and let |Cm| be 6–1/2 for all six m values. The
200fs 393 nm PUMP pulse  launches a wavepacket  that, at t = 0, is identical to the nd
orbital  in  the  4snd  initial  eigenstate.    The  outer  lobe  of  this wavefunction  is  located
near (but not at) the outer turning point of the |4pmd〉 quasi-eigenstates.  The
wavepacket will  evolve  in  a way  that  you will  need  to  figure  out.    The  oscillation
period  is  called  the Kepler period.   Note  that  if you  choose wavefunction phases  so
that  the  innermost  lobe  is  always  positive,  the  outermost  lobe  will  exhibit  a  phase
that  oscillates with  principal  quantum  number,  in  this  case  (–1)m.

A .

For  the 32 ≤ m ≤ 37 wavepacket, what  is  the Kepler period, Tk?

At  different  times  during  a  Kepler  period  the way  in which  the wavepacket
created by the 393nm 200fs PUMP pulse is affected by the 318nm 200fs PROBE
pulse changes.  The PROBE pulse acts on the inner (4p) electron.  The 4d ← 4p
transition  amplitudes  from  all of  the quasi-eigenstate  components  are  in phase
when the wavepacket has returned to its original form at t = 0, Tk, 2Tk and
mostly out-of-phase at t = Tk (2, 3Tk/2, …).

B .

For the 32 ≤ m ≤ 37 wavepacket at t = Tk/2, describe the time-dependent
amplitude of each of  the quasi-eigenstate m-components  in Ψ(Tk/2).   Be explicit
about the phases of the innermost and outermost lobes of each m-component.

When  the  initially  created wavepacket  is  at  its  t  =  0,  Tk,  2Tk  form,  its  rate  of
autoionization  into  the Ca+ 4s + εl  (l  = odd) and Ca+ 3d + ε′l ′ (l ′ = odd) continua
will be different from when it is at its t = Tk/2, … form.   Figure 2 of the attached
paper suggests  that  the autoionization rate  is minimized at  t = 0, Tk, 2Tk and
reaches one or two maxima during each Kepler period.   The autoionization is
due to matrix elements of 1/r12.  The inner part of the md Rydberg orbitals is
most important in determining the magnitude (scaling as m–3/2) of
′ ′ε l  and     4
εl  matrix  elements.

C .

Explain  the  oscillations  in  the  autoionization  rate  of  the  4pmd wavepacket.    I
will be very  impressed by an explanation that accounts for the two maxima  in
the  autoionization  rate  during  each  Kepler  period.

The 318nm 200fs PROBE pulse excites 4d m′d ← 4p md [via Ca+ 4d ← 4p].  [The
quantum defects for the 4dm′d and 4pmd quasi-eigenstates are slightly
different.]    This  new wavepacket  also  autoionizes.    The  autoionization  signals
due  to  the PUMP alone and  the PUMP + PROBE are distinguished via  the
kinetic  energy  of  the  ejected  electrons.    So  the  systematically  time-delayed
PROBE pulse is capable of sampling the population in the PUMP-produced
Ψ (t),  with  approximately  400fs  time  resolution.

If  there were no autoionization  from  the PUMP-produced wavepacket,  there
might  still  be  a  delay-time  dependence  of  the  PROBE-induced  excitation
p robab i l i ty .

D .

Derive  an  expression  for  the  delay-dependent  PROBE  excitation  rate.    Explain
your  assumptions  in  deciding whether  the  excitation  rate  is maximal  at  t  =  0,
Tk, 2Tk or at t = Tk/2, 3Tk/2, … or independent of t.  This is related to your answer
to  part  B.
