Summary of lectures 21 & 22:  
 
 
 
 
 
Development  is  the  process  of  forming  a  multi  cellular  organism  from  a  single  fertilized  egg.  This
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
involves  a  balance  between  cell  division  and  cell  death,  formation  of  cell  types  through  cell 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
differentiation,  positioning  different  cell  types  at  the  correct  locations,  and  organizing  cells  into  the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
correct  three-dimensional shapes. The body of an organism  can be subdivided  into  three primary axes:
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dorsal (back)/ventral (belly) axis, anterior (front)/posterior axis, (back) and left/right axis. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All  cells  in  an  organism  have  the  same  set  of  genes,  yet  different  cell  types  express  different  sets  of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
genes  (combinatorial  codes)  which  regulate  which  cell  type  will  form.  The  functional  form  of  a  cell  is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
called  its  “fate”.  Cells  make  stepwise  decisions  to  assume  their  fate.  Undecided  cells  are  termed 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“uncommitted”  or  “undetermined”.  These  cells  become  determined  or  committed,  where  they  have 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
decided  their  fate,  but  have  not  yet  assumed  it.  Subsequently,  cells  differentiate  to  assume  their  final
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fate.  Determination  involves  activation  of  a  few  regulatory  genes,  which  control  activation  of  many
 
 
 
  
 
effector genes in the differentiated cells. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cells  become  different  through  cell/cell  signaling  (induction)  and  asymmetric  localization  of 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
regulatory molecules (determinants) that include transcription factors, miRNA and translation factors. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Development of multi-cellular organisms proceeds in steps, with increasing complexity over time. In
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
animal development, a key step is the initial generation of asymmetry, which can occur before, at, or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
after fertilization. This results in partitioning of one or more regulatory molecules to just part of the 
 
 
early embryo. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As cell division proceeds, further asymmetry is generated through induction and/or localization of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
determinants, resulting ultimately in the determination and differentiation of various cell types. The
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
number of fate options available to a cell (potency) decreases with time. The zygote is totipotent,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
embryonic cells are multipotent/pluripotent and older cells are generally unipotent or bipotent. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The embryonic axes (dorsoventral, anteroposterior and left/right) are generated very early during
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
development, in some animals by the two or four cell stage. The stages of development are given
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
different names: blastula is a ball of cells formed during the first set of cell divisions after fertilization,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gastrula stage occurs subsequently and is when cells begin to move, neurula and later stages include
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the onset of differentiation. At gastrula, the first cell types can be distinguished, although these are not
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
differentiated. They are called ectoderm, which is on the outside of the embryo and will eventually
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
form the nervous system and outer, epidermal layer of the skin; the mesoderm which will form the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
heart, kidneys, blood and other tissues; and the endoderm, on the inside of the embryo, which will
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
form the lungs and digestive system (gut). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In order to find out which genes are involved in determining a specific cell type, it is necessary to find
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
out which cells in the embryo will form the final cell type.  This is done by fate mapping, where small
groups of embryonic cells are marked with a non-diffusible dye, and the fate of these cells is later
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
monitored. In order to figure out when cells become determined, groups of precursor cells can be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
removed (explanted) from the embryo, and allowed to develop in vitro, before analyzing what they
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have become. Cells can also be transplanted to a different part of the embryo, and their fate later
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
monitored. Finally gene expression characteristic of particular determined cell types can be used to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
monitor when cells become determined.

Questions
 
 
1. This question is about development of the alimentary canal (the “gut”) from the “endodermal” cell
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
layer of the mouse embryo.  This process requires contact between the endoderm (unshaded, labeled A,
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
B, C, D in the diagrams below) and adjacent “mesodermal” cell layer (striped).  Initially, a tube 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
develops in the endoderm of the embryo.  A few days later, the tube becomes kinked, and three days
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
after that, four obvious morphological divisions (A, B, C, D) can be seen along the antero-posterior
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
length of the tube, as diagrammed below.  A, B, C, and D correspond the same regions at all stages
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
(that will give rise to the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, respectively).
 
 
 
 
 
 
Differentiation occurs only at the latest stage, 1 week after the straight tube stage.

In order to analyze the timing of stomach determination, you do the following transplant experiment
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
within the whole embryo in which you invert the endoderm of regions A and B (the future esophagus
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
and stomach) at either straight or kinked tube stage, as indicated below.  The mesoderm is left intact 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
and is not inverted.  After the gut regions have differentiated, you observe that in the straight tube
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transplant, a normal gut develops, whereas in the kinked tube stage transplant, the position of the
 
 
 
 
esophagus and stomach are inverted. 
 

 

 
 
 
 
i.  Distinguish between “determination” and “differentiation.” 
 

 
  
 
 
 
 
ii.	  When does stomach determination occur?  Explain.

iii.	 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a second set of experiments, you isolate (explant) the endoderm of region B at the straight or
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
kinked tube stage, and then culture it for one week.  No mesoderm is removed.  Based on the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
results of the transplant assay above, what would you predict the outcome would be?

2. Leeches are medicinally important animals as they produce hirudin, a very effective anti-clotting
 
 
agent. As embryos, they undergo interesting cell division, where a new row of cells is added at every 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
division, so 1st  row cells are the oldest cells, 2nd  row cells are produced from division of 1st  row cells, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and 3rd  row cells are produced from division of 2nd  row cells. Based on patterns of gene expression, the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
following different “territories” (each a precursor to specific cell fates) are observed at each division.

a) Formulate a hypothesis, based on segregation of cell autonomous regulatory factors to account for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the change in number of territories from the 2 cell to the 4 cell stage. What is the term for this type of 
regulatory factors? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b)  Formulate  a  hypothesis,  based  on  cell-cell  signaling  to  account  for  the  change  in  number  of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
territories  from  the 4 cell to  the 6 cell stage. Comment on when  this signaling  is  likely  to occur. What  is
 
 
 
 
 
 
the term for this type of signaling?
