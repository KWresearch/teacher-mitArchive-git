Section 5- Solution key:
 
 
 
1. In the box below, write the most likely mode of inheritance of the following pedigree? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
3 

 
4 

Autosomal recessive 
 

1          2                           3              4 
 

 
Phenotypically normal 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Affected with Hemophilia A 
 
 
 
 
 
Affected with hemophilia B 

 
 
 
 
5               6                           7          8 
 
? 
 
Given each consistent mode of inheritance, if the couple in question decides to have a child, what is the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
probability of that child being affected?  (Note: Use the uppercase or lowercase A to represent the alleles for 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the dominant and recessive traits).
 
 
 
 
The probability of individual 6 being a carrier  is 2/3 and person 7  is a carrier. If they are both carriers then the probability of 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
their child being a carrier is ¼. So the overall probability of their child being a carrier is  ( 2/3 X 1X ¼) =1/6. 
 
 
 
 
2.  Consider  the  pedigree  below  showing  the  inheritance  of  two  X-linked  diseases,  hemophilia  A  and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hemophilia B. Hemophilia A  is due to a  lack of one clotting factor, and hemophilia B  is due to a  lack of
a different  clotting  factor. Each  clotting  factor  is a protein  that  is  encoded by  a  specific gene  located on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the X chromosome. Note that no individual shown in this pedigree is affected with both hemophilia
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
A and hemophila B.

a) Write the genotypes for the following individuals at both the hemophilia A and hemophilia B
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disease loci. Clearly define your genotype symbols.

XAbY

5 
 
XABY 
 
b) How do you account for individual 5 not being affected with either hemophilia A or hemophilia B?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
   
 
Individual #5 is the product of a fusion of a sperm with an egg from individual 4that had undergone
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recombination between the A and the B genes during meiosis 1.
