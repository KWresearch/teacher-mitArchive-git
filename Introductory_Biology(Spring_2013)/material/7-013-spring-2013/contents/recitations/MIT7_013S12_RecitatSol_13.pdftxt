2. This question is about development of the alimentary canal (the “gut”) from the “endodermal” cell
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
layer of the mouse embryo.  This process requires contact between the endoderm (unshaded, labeled A,
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
B, C, D in the diagrams below) and adjacent “mesodermal” cell layer (striped).  Initially, a tube 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
develops in the endoderm of the embryo.  A few days later, the tube becomes kinked, and three days
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
after that, four obvious morphological divisions (A, B, C, D) can be seen along the antero-posterior
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
length of the tube, as diagrammed below.  A, B, C, and D correspond the same regions at all stages
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(that will give rise to the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, respectively).
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Differentiation occurs only at the latest stage, 1 week after the straight tube stage.

In order to analyze the timing of stomach determination, you do the following transplant experiment
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
within the whole embryo in which you invert the endoderm of regions A and B (the future esophagus
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and stomach) at either straight or kinked tube stage, as indicated below.  The mesoderm is left intact 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
and is not inverted.  After the gut regions have differentiated, you observe that in the straight tube
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transplant, a normal gut develops, whereas in the kinked tube stage transplant, the position of the
 
 
 
 
esophagus and stomach are inverted. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a) Distinguish between “determination” and “differentiation.”
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Determination refers to the decision to become a certain cell type., whereas differentiation refers to formation of
 
 
 
  
the final functional cell. 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
b) When does stomach determination occur?  Explain.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At or just before the kinked tube stage, since at this time, the fate of the endoderm is fixed and cannot be altered by
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adjacent mesoderm. The first result, at the straight tube stage implies that the mesoderm is responsible for
instructing (inducing) specific regions of the gut to develop. By the kinked tube stage, the identity of the stomach
 
is fixed.

c) In a second set of experiments, you isolate (explant) the endoderm of region B at both the straight 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and kinked tube stages, and then culture it for one week.  No mesoderm is removed.  Based on the 
 
 
 
results of the transplant assay above, what would you predict the outcome would be?

2. Leeches are medicinally important animals as they produce hirudin, a very effective anti-clotting
 
agent. As embryos, they undergo interesting cell division, where a new row of cells is added at every
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
division, so 1st  row cells are the oldest cells, 2nd  row cells are produced from division of 1st  row cells, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and 3rd  row cells are produced from division of 2nd  row cells. Based on patterns of gene expression, the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
following different “territories” (each a precursor to specific cell fates) are observed at each division.

2 cell stage

a) Formulate a hypothesis, based on segregation of cell autonomous regulatory factors to account for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the change in number of territories from the 2 cell to the 4 cell stage. What is the term for this type of 
regulatory factors?
 
 
The 1st  row cells retain a determinant that regulates their specific fate. The 2nd  row cells do not receive this and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
therefore are different from 1st  row cells . Conversely, you could hypothesize that the 2nd  row cells inherit a 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
determinant at cell division that is not retained in the 1st  row cells, and therefore their fates are different. Thus 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
depending upon the receipt of the determinant different cells can end up having different fates. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b)  Formulate  a  hypothesis,  based  on  cell-cell  signaling  to  account  for  the  change  in  number  of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
territories  from  the 4 cell to  the 6 cell stage. Comment on when  this signaling  is  likely  to occur. What  is
 
 
 
 
 
 
the term for this type of signaling?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2nd row cells secrete a ligand that acts on 3rd row cells to change their fate. The 3rd row cells contain the receptor 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and downstream signaling components for this ligand. This is called induction.
