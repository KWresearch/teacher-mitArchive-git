Ions can move across membranes through pumps and channels.  Integral membrane proteins like these 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
cross the membrane via transmembrane domains.  Pumps are ATPases that set up the concentration
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gradients of ions across cell membranes, such that K+ is high inside cells and other ions (such as Cl–, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
Na+, and Ca++) are high outside cells.  A membrane potential is only set up by ions that move freely
across the membrane through open channels, creating one side of the membrane that is more positive.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This movement of ions does not dissipate the concentration gradient because the number of ions that 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
move to generate a membrane potential is very small compared to the number of ions that need to be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
pumped to create a concentration gradient.  Most cell membranes only contain open K+ channels and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
thus only K+ flows freely across membranes through channels; K+ is high inside, causing it to flow
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
outside, giving the inside of cells a negative membrane potential. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ions are free to move across the membrane through open ion channels.  Two forces act to dictate this 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
movement – the concentration gradient and the membrane potential.  Ions move down their 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concentration gradients through channels, and ions move towards the side of the membrane that
 
   
 
 
harbors the opposite charge. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Neurons  are  the  cells of your nervous  system  that make  connections with  each  other  in  order  to  allow
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
you  to  think and  feel.  Each neuron has a cell body  (where  the nucleus  lives), dendrites (multiple small
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
membrane projections that receive signals from other cells or from  the environment), and an axon (one
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
large  membrane  projection  that  sends  signals  to  other  cells).  The  place  where  the  dendrites  of  one
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
neuron communicate with the axon of another neuron is called a synapse. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Action potentials are the characteristic changes in membrane potential that propagate down the length
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of axons, unidirectionally at each point on the membrane from the hillock to the terminus.  An action 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
potential begins when a threshold membrane potential is reached at the axon hillock, and voltage-gated
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Na+ channels are induced to open.  Once Na+ rushes in, the inside of the cell becomes positive, and
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this induces the voltage-gated K+ channels to open.  Thus K+ rushes out, restoring the membrane
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
potential back to normal (roughly –70mV).  Action potentials do not vary by amplitude; the maximal 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
membrane potential is always +50mV.  Instead, action potentials vary in frequency.  The axons of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
motor neurons are coated in a myelin sheath that allows action potentials to travel down axons faster
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by allowing them to jump from node to node between patches of insulation. 
 
A neuron receives signals at its dendrites and sends signals down its axon. A synapse occurs wherever
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the axon terminus of one neuron meets the dendrite of another neuron (or a muscle cell).  At a synapse,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
the electrical signal of an action potential is converted to the chemical signal of a neurotransmitter, and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
then this is converted back into an electrical signal in the post-synaptic cell.  This occurs because, when
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
an action potential reaches the axon terminus of a pre-synaptic cell, voltage-gated Ca++ channels open,
 
 
 
 
and intracellular calcium induces the exocytosis of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.  The 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
exocytosed neurotransmitters then bind to receptors in the dendrites of the post-synaptic cell.  These 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
ligand-gated ion channels are then opened, leading to changes in membrane potential that are summed
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
at the axon hillock. If the sum of all these changes is greater than threshold, the post-synaptic neuron
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
will fire an action potential, first at the hillock and then at each subsequent location down the axon to
 
 
 
 
 
 
the axon terminus. 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Neuromuscular  junctions are synapses where a nerve cell contacts a muscle cell.  The neurotransmitter 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
that  is  released  from  the  neurons  at  neuromuscular  junctions  is  Ach  (acetylcholine).  The  release  of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
enough Ach will trigger the muscle cell to contract.  Ach is cleared from the synapse by an enzyme that 
 
     
 
 
cleaves Ach called Ach esterase. 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
Nerve-nerve  synapses  use  many  different  neurotransmitters.  Some  neurotransmitters  are  excitatory;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
their  receptors  allow  the  flow  of  ions  that  causes  the  inside  of  the  post-synaptic  cell  to  become  more
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
positive,  making  the  cell  closer  to  the  threshold  needed  to  fire  an  action  potential.  Other 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
neurotransmitters  are  inhibitory;  their  receptors  allow  the  flow  of  ions  that  causes  the  inside  of  the

post-synaptic cell to become more negative, making the cell farther from the threshold needed to fire an
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
action potential. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There can be many, many inputs to a postsynaptic cell, and the summation of all of these inputs occurs
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
across  the  cell  body.  If  the  excitatory  inputs  are  sufficient  to  depolarize  the  membrane  at  the  axon
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hillock,  the  voltage-gated  Na+  channels  at  the  axon  hillock  will  open  and  an  action  potential  will  be
 
generated. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Two  types  of  receptors  can  be  found  at  a  synpase:  fast  ionotropic  receptors,  which  are  ion  channel
    
  
 
 
 
 
 
receptors and the slower metabotropic receptors which indirectly activate  channels.

2. Dopamine is one of major neurotransmitters in the mammalian brain that regulates mood, cognition
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and locomotion. Dopamine acts on two types of receptors:  the D1 receptor is an inhibitory ligand-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gated channel, the D2 receptor activates the G proteins, and is excitatory. The released neurotransmitter
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is taken back into the presynaptic cell, for re-use. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a) On what part of the neuron are the dopamine receptors localized? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) Is either D1 or D2 a metabotropic receptor? Explain. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) The D1 receptor is inhibitory and transports K+ ions. Would K+ be moved into or out of the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
postsynaptic cell? Explain the mechanism underlying this inhibitory effect. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d) The D2 receptor is excitatory, and its ion targets are believed to include Ca2+. Would Ca2+ be
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
moved into or out of the postsynaptic cell?  Explain the mechanism underlying this excitatory effect.
