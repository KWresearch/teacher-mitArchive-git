Summary of Lectures 2 & 3: 
 
 
 
Bonding: There are many types of bonds that hold molecules together.  Covalent bonds result when 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
two atoms share a pair of electrons between them, such as the bonds between C and H in methane.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Ionic bonds occur between atoms with a very high difference in electronegativities.  Hydrogen bonds
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
occur between polar molecules, such as molecules of water, because of the partial negative charge on
the O and the partial positive charge on the H i.e. difference in the electronegativity of O and H atoms.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Van der Waals forces are very weak forces that occur between all atoms because of random distribution
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of electrons.  Hydrophobic effects promote the association of hydrophobic molecules together in order
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for them to avoid water and thereby increase entropy. 
  
Biological macromolecules- Lipids and Carbohydrates: All the cells, whether prokaryotic or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
eukaryotic, have biological polymers or macromolecules.  They are composed of the same major classes 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
of macromolecules: lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids and proteins. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lipids or fats are predominately hydrocarbon chains that are used as energy storage and insulation.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Lipids are hydrophobic in nature.  Modified lipids form phospholipids, steroid hormones, cholesterol
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and some vitamins. Cell membranes are composed of lipid bilayers, which separate the aqueous inside
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the cell (the cytoplasm) from the aqueous outside of the cell (the extra cellular environment).  One 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
specific type of lipid, called phospholipids, has polar phosphate groups as heads and two long
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
hydrocarbon tails that are hydrophobic.  Phospholipids form lipid bilayers in aqueous solutions that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
expose the phosphate head groups on each side of the layer and hide the hydrophobic tails in between
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
the two rows of head groups.  Cell membrane is selectively semi-permeable. Only small hydrophobic
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
molecules can pass through cell membranes.  All large or polar or charged molecules must cross the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
membrane through protein pores in the membrane. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Carbohydrates include monosaccharides and disaccharides like glucose and lactose. A monosaccharide
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is composed of carbons flanked by H atoms or -OH groups and can be linear or have a ring structure.
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Many monosaccharides are linked together to form polysaccharides like starch and cellulose.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Carbohydrates are used as an energy source, as a source for carbon, and can be attached to other
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
molecules to serve as recognition markers for the cell. 
 
Questions:
 
 
1. Many glucose monomers can be linked together through glycosidic bonds to make polysaccharides
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
such as glycogen in animals and starch in plants. What is the advantage of storing carbohydrates as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
polysaccharides as opposed to monosaccharides? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Oil is fluid at room temperature but butter is solid. Which types of fats (saturated/unsaturated) 
 
 
 
 
predominate in oil and butter?

3. Each cell in an organism has a plasma membrane that defines its boundaries, however the plasma
 
 
 
 
 
membranes of different cell types show different fluidity. What factors determine the fluidity of the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
plasma membrane? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. When biomedical researchers design drugs that must enter cells to be effective, they often add
 
 
 
 
 
methyl (-CH3) groups, which make the drugs more likely to enter the cells. Why does this work? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. The structure of one lipid that can use to make up a lipid monolayer is shown below.  Why would
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
you not need a bilayer (i.e. but instead could use a lipid monolayer) if you used this specific kind of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lipid to make up a cell membrane? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6. The following diagram represents a substrate molecule bound to the active site of a protein.  The R 
 
groups from the amino acids in the protein’s substrate-binding region are shown. Each of the four R
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
groups from the protein that interacts with the substrate is numbered on the figure below. For each 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
side chain, state the strongest type of interaction it could have with the substrate in the configuration
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
shown below.  Your choices are: Covalent, Hydrophobic, Ionic, Hydrogen, and Van der Waals. Also classify 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
each R group as hydrophobic, polar or charged.

Note: R1 & R2 represent charged groups and “∧” represents bonds between C and H atoms.
