Summary of Lectures 5 - 7: 
 
   
 
Introduction to Genetics: Each double-stranded piece of DNA in a cell is a chromosome. A
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
eukaryotic cell usually contains 5-50 linear chromosomes.  A chromosome is comprised of DNA and
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
histone proteins and usually has a few thousand genes on it, all in a row. A gene is a short region of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DNA (a few 1000 nucleotides) that encodes the RNA or a protein that has some specific cellular
 
 
 
 
function. Two alleles (or versions) of the same gene may differ at only a single nucleotide and often
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
affect the identity of only a single amino acid in the protein product of the gene.  This single amino acid 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
change may alter a gene product such that it works differently or not at all.  The changed function of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that protein may affect the phenotype of the organism possessing that allele; for instance, a single
 
 
 
 
nucleotide change in the DNA of a plant can result in wrinkled seeds instead of round seeds. The
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
genotype of an organism is the alleles possessed by that organism.  The phenotype of an organism is 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
how that organism looks on the outside (round or wrinkled). 
 
Mendel’s laws and monohybrid cross: A monohybrid cross is when you cross two true-breeding 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i.e. homozygous) organisms that differ by a single characteristic, such as plants that produce rounded
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
versus wrinkled seeds.  The two organisms you cross are called the P (parental) generation. For
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
example, a cross between two individuals, which are both homozygous and differ from each other in
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
one gene can be represented  as AA X aa. The offspring will all receive one allele from each parent and
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
will have the genoptye Aa.  They will display whichever of the two phenotypes is dominant.  If you
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cross two F1 organisms together (Aa x Aa), you create the F2 generation. The ratios of different
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
genotypes and phenotypes within the F2 generation can be derived either by using the laws of basic
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
probability (the sum rule and the product rule) or by using a Punnett Square. 
 
Dihybrid cross: A dihybrid cross is when you cross two true-breeding organisms that differ by two
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
characteristics, such as plants that produce rounded green (AABB) versus wrinkled yellow (aabb)
 
 
seeds.  The F1 will be genotypically AaBb and will display the dominant shape and dominant color 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phenotype.  If you cross two F1 organisms together, you create the F2 generation.  Each parent passes
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on one of their two alleles at each gene to the new progeny, and thus the F2 will consist of a phenotypic
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ratio of 9:3:3:1 (if the genes are independent from one another). 
 
 
 
Cell division: Mitosis consists of four phases.  In prophase, the chromosomes become condensed and 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
visible.  In metaphase, the chromosomes all align along the central axis of the cell.  In anaphase, the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sister chromatids separate from each other such that one copy of the genome goes to each daughter cell.
 
 
 
 
 
 
In telophase, the separated nuclei decondense their chromosomes so that you can no longer see
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
individual DNA molecules.  Right after mitosis, cytokinesis occurs, which is the division of everything
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
else besides the nucleus (i.e. the cytoplasm and all of the organelles contained in the cytoplasm).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Meiosis has two divisions; meiosis 1 looks different from mitosis, but meiosis II looks similar to mitosis.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The result of meiosis is the production of haploid gamete cells such as eggs or sperm, each of which has
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
half the number of chromosomes as a diploid somatic cell. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Recombination and crossing over: Homologous recombination is the reciprocal exchange of DNA
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between two homologous chromosomes that occurs only during metaphase of meiosis I.  During 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
homologous recombination, two homologs (e.g. the chromosome #7 inherited from dad and the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
chromosome #7 inherited from mom) break at the same place and switch ends with each other.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Homologous recombination results in a change in which alleles are on the same chromosomes together
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(e.g. a cell with “AB” on the maternal homolog and “ab” on the paternal homolog can give rise to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
gametes containing “Ab” or “aB” chromosomes).  The two recombinants (“Ab” and “aB”) will always
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be created in equal frequencies because one of each kind is created by a single recombination event. 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Two genes can either be unlinked, completely linked or somewhat linked.  Genes that are unlinked are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
usually located on different chromosomes from each other or are located far apart from each other on 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
the same chromosome.  Genes that are completely linked are very close to each other on the same 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
chromosome.  Genes that are somewhat linked are located on the same chromosome with a map
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
distance of  <50cM.  Unlinked genes assort independently from each other; this means that an AaBb
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
parent would create their four possible gametes (AB, ab, Ab, and aB) each 25% of the time.  Genes that 
 
 
8
 

 

 

  

 

 

 

are completely linked always segregate with each other.  This means that an AaBb parent would create 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
only two of the four possible gametes.  Genes that are somewhat linked to each other show a pattern
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that is in between what is seen for unlinked genes and completely linked genes. 
 
 
Questions:

How might we write the genotypes of Mouse #1 and Mouse #2 if Sequence #1 encodes a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
functional protein but Sequence #2 encodes a protein that no longer works? (Note: Use the upper 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
case or lowercase A while writing the genotypes).

chromosomes (2n = 4). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The genotype of the cell above is DdEeFf, where the D and E loci are on the large chromosome and the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
F locus is on the small chromosome.  This cell was taken from an F1 organism that resulted from the
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cross of two true-breeding parents such that Parent 1 is  DDeeFF and Parent 2 is ddEEff. Draw and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
align the chromosomes as they could be when in metaphase of meiosis I. Include the D, d, E, e, F, and f
 
 
 
 
 
 
alleles on the drawing and assume no recombination. Given your drawing, draw the chromosomes in
each of the two products resulting from meiosis I. Include the D, d, E, e, F, and f alleles on the drawing.

5. Tomato plants can be tall or short and have notched or smooth leaves. You cross a tall, smooth 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
leafed plant with a short, notched leafed plant.  All of the progeny are tall, and notched leafed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a) Which traits are dominant and which are recessive? 
 
 
b) What are the genotypes of the two true-breeding parents?  Use the letters H or h to represent the alleles
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the height gene and the letters S or s to represent the alleles of the leaf gene.  In each case, use the uppercase
 
 
 
 
 
letter for the allele associated with the dominant phenotype and the lower case letter for the allele associated with
 
 
 
the recessive phenotype. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) Two tall, notched F1 plants were crossed.
 
 
 
i. 	  Diagram this cross. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6. In fruit flies, the “B/b” gene and the “G/g” gene are linked.  In one specific fly whose genotype is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
GgBb, “B” is linked to “g” on the maternal chromosome #2, and “b” is linked to “G” on the paternal
 
   
 
 
 
   
 
chromosome #2. Note: This is a practice question related to lecture 8. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
List all parental type (non-recombinant) gametes by genotype that could be produced by this 
i.	 
 
  
 
GgBb fly. 

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If these two traits are unlinked, what ratio of phenotype do you expect in the F2 generation?

ii.	 
 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
List all recombinant gametes by genotype that could be produced by this GgBb fly. 

iii.	 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Say that 40% of all gametes produced by the GgBb fly are “Bg.”  What percentage of all gametes 
  
 
 
 
 
produced by this fly are recombinants? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iv.	  As the recombination frequency between two genes on the same chromosome rises, does the

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
physical distance between those two genes lower or rise?
