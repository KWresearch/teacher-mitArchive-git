Summary from Lectures 29 & 30
 
 
Cancer   is   the   uncontrolled   proliferation   of   a   single   cell   that   leads   to   a   tumor,  which   is   a 
mass   of   cells   that   are   clonal   descendents   of   that   single   cell.       “Cancer”   is   a   term  for   a  
group  of  many diseases  that  are   caused  by   the  accumulation  of  many  mutations  in  both 
tumor   suppressor   genes   and   oncogenes.   Mutations   accumulate   in   cells   throughout  life 
due   to   the  exposure   to  mutagens,  such as   those   found  in sun  rays,   the  air,  our   food,  and 
cigarette   smoke.     Cancer   is   a  genetic   disease  in   the  sense  that   an   accumulation   of 
mutations   in   genes   leads   to   cancer.     Less   than   10%  of   cancers   are   inherited,   however.  
This  is  because  most  mutations  leading  to  cancer  occur  in somatic  cells.  
 
Benign tumors  are  clumps  of cells th  at may  be  growing  but are  not invading  other 
tissues.   Metastatic tu  mors a  re  tumors th  at have  had  specific c  ells d  etached  from  the 
original  tumor  and  travel  to a  second  site  in  the  body.   Metastatic  tumors  can  establish  
new  sites  of  growth throughout  the  body and spread to  multiple  organs.  
 
Cancer   causing   agents   are   called   carcinogens   and   they   are   mostly   mutagens   or  
promutagens.   These   can  be   detected  either   by   using   the   original   Ame’s   test     (which 
detects  mutagen)   or  modified  Ame’s   test   ( which   can detect  mutagens   and  also   the  pro- 
mutagens).  
 
Tumor   suppressors   genes   and  proto-  oncogenes   are   normal   genes   that   work   in   a  
regulated   fashion   in   a   normal   cell   to   properly   control   the   cell   cycle.     The   wild-type 
function   of  a   tumor   suppressor   gene   is   to   inhibit   the   cell   cycle   in  any  cell   that   is   not 
supposed   to   be   actively   growing   and   dividing.     Both   homologous  versions  of   a   tumor 
suppressor gene m  ust  loose t  heir function  to  transform  a  normal  cell  to  a  cancerous type. 
The   wild-type   function   of  an   oncogene   is   to   promote   the   cell  cycle   in   any   cell  that   is 
supposed   to   be   actively   growing   and  dividing.    One   of   the   two   homologous versions  of 
an  oncogene must  gain  a function  or  increase its  function  for  a cell  to  become cancerous.  
Normal    cellular  counterparts  of  the  oncogenes  are  called   the  proto- oncogenes.  Some  of 
these  genes  are  carried  by  oncogenic  viruses  and  are  designated  as  v-oncogenes.    The  v–  
oncogenes   can   be   linked   to  potent   promoters   that   lead   to  their   inappropriate   and   high 
level  expression,   leading   to   deregulated   cell   division.  One   example   is   the  Rous   sarcoma 
virus   (RSV).   This   retrovirus   infects   the   chickens,   thereby  causing  them   to  acquire  
tumors.     Here   the   viral   genome   contains   a   gene   that  it  has   stolen   at  some   point  from   a  
host  cell.   This  gene  is an  oncogene  called  src that  is involved  in  cell  signaling.   The  virus 
carries  a   mutant   version   of   src  that   produces  an   overactive   form   of   the   normal   cellular 
kinase  src.  When RSV  infects  a  cell,  the  mutant  src  is  transcribed  and  translated,  creating 
an o  veractive  cell  signaling protein that  promotes  growth and  division in chicken cells  to 
form  tumors.  Other  examples  include  the  avian  leukemia  virus  that causes  leukemia  and  
human papilloma  virus  responsible  for  cervical  cancer.  
 
Questions:  
1.  Why  is  cancer predominantly a 
 
 disease  of  old  age?   What  about  the  usual  cause  of 
cancer  makes it  more  common  in  older  people?  
 
2. Why are the mutations that cause cancer generally not passed on to one’s offspring? 
Why  are  almost  all  cancers  sporadic  as  opposed  to  familial/inherited?)

3. Describe the basic principal behind the standard Ames test. How is this different from 
modified  Ames  test?  
 
 
4. What does it mean that a tumor is almost always clonal (or monoclonal)?  
 
5. Why is it that cancer cells containing mutations in g  enes encoding E  CM  (extracellular 
matrix)  proteins  are  more  dangerous  than  cancer  cells  with  normal  ECM  genes?  
 
 
6. Weinberg’s famous experiment: Ras was the first oncogene to be discovered.  Ras is  
part  of  a  cell  signaling  pathway.   The  input  for  this pathway i  s an e  xtracellular protein 
growth factor,  and  the  output  is  to  induce  transcription of  genes  necessary for  the  cell 
cycle  to  occur.   Ras is a  GTPase  that  is active  in  the  GTP-bound  form  but  inactive  in the  
GDP-bound  form.   Ras  was  discovered  in the  Weinberg  lab  via  the  following  
experiment.   Human  tumor  DNA  was  cut  into  pieces,  and  each  different  piece was  put 
into  a  different m  ouse  cell.   The  mouse  cells  were  then  grown  in  Petri plates.   Only  the 
mouse  cell  that  took  up  the  mutant  allele  of  the  oncogene  could  grow a  nd  divide  enough 
to  form  a  colony  of cells.  
 

i.	   Do  you  think  that  the  mouse  cells  had  their  own  versions  of  Ras  before  the 
experiment  began?   If  yes,  do  you  think  that  the mouse versions  of  Ras  were 
wild-type  or  mutant?  

ii. 	 

In  this  experiment,  it seems th  at there  was o  nly  one  mutation  necessary  to  make 
the  mouse  cells o  ver-proliferate.   We  know,  however,  that  cancer  results  from  an 
accumulation  of  mutations.   Why  then  did  this  experiment  work?  

iii.	  

If a 
 
 patient h  ad  a  tumor  that w  as  caused  in  part by  mutations i  n  Ras,  do  you 
think  it would  be  a  good  therapeutic d  ecision  to  treat the  cancer  patient with  a 
drug  that  targets  and inhibits  Ras?    

iv. 	  Do  you  think  it  would  be  a  good  therapeutic  decision  to  provide  this  cancer 

patient  with a  wild-type  copy  of  the  Ras  gene? 
 

v. 	  Do  you  think  that  this  experimental  technique  would  work  to  identify  tumor 
suppressor genes?  Why o  r why n  ot?
