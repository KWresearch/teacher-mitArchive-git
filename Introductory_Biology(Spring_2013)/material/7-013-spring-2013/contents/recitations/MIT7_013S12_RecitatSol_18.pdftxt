Section 1 8 - Solution key  
 
1. Retinoblastoma is caused by the mutation in the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor 
gene.  There  are  several  mechanisms,  which can cause  a  cell  to  lose  its normal  gene  and 
thus b  e  predisposed  to  develop  into  a  tumor.  These  may  result in  a  "loss o  f 
heterozygosity"  or  "LOH".   
 
a)  What  do  you  mean  by  LOH?  Loss  of  heterozygosity.  
 
b)  Many  clinicians  and  scientists  are  currently  trying  to  develop  cancer  treatments th  at 
are more specific  and  targeted  than  chemotherapy.  If  a patient  had  a tumor  that  was 
caused  in  part  by  mutations in  Rb  do  you  think  it  would  be  a  good  therapeutic decision 
to  provide  this c  ancer  patient with  a  wild-type  copy  of the  Rb  gene? 
Yes,  since mutations in t  he tumor suppressor genes are the loss-of-function mutations and 
providing a  wild-type  copy  of  the  tumor  suppressor  gene  would  restore  the  cell  to r  emain  in  its 
wild-type  form.  
 
3.  Why  do  some people think  that  viruses  are alive and  some people don’t? 
They  need  the  host  cells  to  replicate  otherwise  they  remain  dormant.  Therefore  they  are  regarded 
as  being  at  the  borderline  of  living  and  non-living.  
 
4. Could you treat a viral infection by antibiotics (Yes/No)? Explain.  
No,  antibiotics  are  used  to  treat  bacterial  infections.  They  do  so  by  arresting  bacterial  growth 
(bacteriostatic) or  kill  the  bacteria (b  acteriocidal).  Viruses  replicate  inside  the  eukaryotic c  ell, 
which  are  not  targeted  by  antibiotics.  
 
5. What is the genetic material  (DNA /  RNA)  in  a  plus  and  minus  stranded  virus?  How  
does  a  plus  stranded virus  differ  from  a    minus  stranded virus?   
Both  have  RNA  as  their  genetic  material.  A  plus  stranded  RNA  virus  has  the  same  polarity  as 
the  mRNA  of  the  host cell  in  comparison  to a m   
inus  stranded  virus  that has  a g  enome  with 
opposite  polarity.  It  still  needs  to make  its  RNA  polymerase  using  the  host  cell  machinery.  In 
comparison,  the minus stranded  RNA  virus needs to bring  its own R  NA  dependent  RNA 
polymerase  in  the  host  cell  at  the  time  of  infection.  
 
6. The following sequence is a short viral gene from a double-stranded  DNA  virus that  
actually  encodes  three different  proteins.   The sequence shown  is  from  the transcription  
start  site  to  the  transcriptional  end  site.   The  upper strand  of  this gene  is used  as a  
template  in  transcription.

a)  How do  you  know that  it  is  true  that  these  three  short  proteins  are  not  produced  from 
alternative splicing  of  a  single  transcript? 
Alternative  splicing  does  not  occur  in  viruses.  
 
b)  How many  amino  acids  long  would  each  of  the  three  proteins  be  that  are  produced 
from  this g  ene? 
The  peptides  produced  will  be  5,  11  and  7  amino  acids  long  using  the  1st,  2nd  and  3rd  open  reading  
frames from the 5’ end of the transcript.  
 
c)  What  is  a  major  advantage  for  the  virus  to  using  this  strategy? 
It can  use  the  same  transcript to p  roduce  different proteins  and  allowing  it to u  se  limited  space 
more  efficiently.  
 
d)  What  is a  major disadvantage  for the  virus to  using t  his strategy?  
A single  mutation  in  one  transcript  influences  not  just  one  viral  protein  but  may  have  an  effect 
on  all  the  viral  proteins  that  are  being  made  from  the  single  transcript.
