 

SOLUTION  KEY- SECTION 11 
 
 
 
  
 
1. You are interested in four different proteins in a yeast cell: protein 1 is a cytosolic protein, protein 2 is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a secreted protein, protein 3 is a nuclear protein and protein 4 is a transmembrane protein. You plan to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
study how the proteins are localized to their specific destination by creating the following mutations in
 
 
 
 
  
the genes encoding proteins 1-4. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a) Mutation A inactivates the SRP (signal recognition particle). Indicate how the localization of each

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
protein (1-4) will be affected by this mutation. In addition, state whether each protein will function as it

 
 
 
  
does in a wild-type cell. 

 
  
Protein 1: The localization and function will be unchanged.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Protein 3: The localization and function will be unchanged.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Proteins 2 and 4: With no SRP, translation for this protein may not be completed and if it is, the protein will be

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
localized to the cytosol.  As a transmembrane protein the natural function would NOT be intracellular, so protein

 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 will NOT function as it would in a wild-type cell. Neither will Protein 2 whose function is outside the cell.
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) Mutation B removes the signal sequence from protein 2. Indicate how the localization of each protein

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1-4) will be affected by this mutation. In addition, state whether each protein will function as it does in

  
 
a wild-type cell.

 
 
  
Protein 1: The localization and function will be unchanged.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Protein 2:  With no signal sequence, translation for this protein will be completed in the cytosol and the protein

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
will be localized to the cytosol.  As a secreted protein the natural function would NOT be intracellular, so protein

  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
2 will NOT function as it would in a wild-type cell.

  
 
Protein 3: The localization and function will be unchanged.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Protein 4: The localization and function will be unchanged.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) Mutation C removes the signal sequence from protein 4. Indicate how the localization of each protein

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1-4) will be affected by this mutation. In additional state whether each protein will function as it does

  
 
 
 
in a wild-type cell.

 
 
 
  
 
 
Proteins 1, 2 & 3: The localization and function will be unchanged.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Protein 4: With no signal sequence, translation for this protein will be completed in the cytosol and the protein

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
will be localized to the cytosol.  As a transmembrane protein the natural function would NOT be intracellular, so

 
 
 
 
 
protein 4 will NOT function as it would in a wild-type cell.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d) Mutation D prevents the fusion of vesicles to the golgi body membrane. Indicate how the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
localization of each protein (1-4) will be affected by this mutation. In addition, state whether each

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
protein will function as it does in a wild-type cell.

  
Protein 1: The localization and function will likely be unchanged.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Protein 2: In a cell that cannot fuse vesicles to the golgi, secreted protein will become trapped in the vesicles in

 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
cytoplasm. So protein 2 will NOT function as it would in a wild-type cell.

 
Protein 3: The localization and function may be unchanged.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Protein 4: In a cell that cannot fuse vesicles to the golgi, protein will become trapped in the vesicles in cytoplasm. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
So protein 4 will NOT function as it would in a wild-type cell.
