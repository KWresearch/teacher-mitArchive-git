Summary of Lecture 4: 
 
 
 
 
Biological macromolecules- Nucleic acids and Proteins: Nucleic acids [Deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
/ Ribonucleic acids (RNA)] are polymers specialized for the storage, transfer and use of genetic
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
information. They are comprised of nucleotides (A, T, G, C and U) each of which has phosphate group,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
a pentose sugar and a nitrogenous base.  Polymers of nucleic acid are formed by linking the 5’
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phosphate group of incoming nucleotide to the 3’ hydroxyl group on the pentose sugar of last
 
 
 
 
 
 
nucleotide in the growing nucleic acid strand.  DNA is the hereditary material in the cell and is usually
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
double-stranded. The RNA is usually single-stranded and is of three major types: ribosomal (rRNA),
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
transfer (tRNA) and messenger (mRNA).  The mRNA gets translated to proteins. In comparison, the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tRNA and rRNA are involved in the synthesis of proteins. Nucleotides also serve as energy sources
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(ATP and GTP) and second messengers (cAMP) during intracellular or cell-cell signaling. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Proteins are linear chains of amino acids of which there are 20 distinct types.  The order of the amino 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
acids in the chain dictates the shape that the protein will take and therefore the function of the protein
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the cell. There are 4 levels of protein structure: primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary. The
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
precise sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain constitutes the primary structure of proteins. A
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
protein’s secondary structure (α- helix and β- pleated sheets) is comprised of regular repeated spatial
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
patterns in different region of polypeptide chains and is predominantly stabilized by hydrogen bonds.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The different interactions between the side chain groups of the amino acids determine the 3-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dimensional tertiary structure of proteins. Quaternary structure results when two or more polypeptide 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
chains in a protein bind to and interact with each other. Proteins perform all possible functions within a
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cell except storage of hereditary information.  Proteins can be structural, can be used to transport
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
materials, can be used for locomotion of cells and be used as enzymes or biological catalysts. It is worth
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mentioning that the RNA may also have enzymatic activity. 
 
Enzymes and energy: An endergonic reaction (one with a positive ΔG) cannot occur spontaneously, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
although it may be coupled to an exergonic reaction.  An exergonic reaction (one with a negative ΔG)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
can proceed spontaneously.  Exergonic reactions do not necessarily proceed quickly; this highlights the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
difference between thermodynamics and kinetics. The thermodynamics of the reaction are dictated by
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the difference in free energy between the substrate and the products. The kinetics of the reaction is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
determined by the transition stage and how much energy must be added to form the intermediate.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Enzymes lower the activation energy needed for a reaction to proceed, but do not change the free
 
 
 
 
energy of either the reactants or the products. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Enzymes are biological catalysts. They catalyze specific reactions and act by lowering the activation
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
energy of their reaction. Each enzyme has a specific 3-dimensional conformation and an active site to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which the substrate molecules can bind. The complex then gives rise to product (P) and the enzyme is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
released in its original form to catalyze the reaction once again.  Each enzyme is specific for a particular
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reaction. Enzyme functioning may be regulated by various factors. These factors may include i.e.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
prosthetic groups, metal ions / cofactors, coenzyme, substrate concentration, pH, temperature,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inhibitors, allosteric modulators and the feedback inhibition by the end product.

Questions:
 
1. Nucleic acids are of two major types: double helical DNA and single stranded RNA.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.	  Draw the chemical structure of a DNA molecule composed of three deoxy-ribonucleotides.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Label the 3’ and 5’ ends. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

  

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
ii.	  How is a nucleotide different from a nucleoside? 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iii.  Why the two strands of DNA are anti-parallel to each other? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iv.  Why is RNA more reactive compared to a DNA? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RNA is single stranded. However, it can have a very complex three-dimensional structure.
v.	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Certain regions of RNA may show intra- molecular base pairing. Is the base pairing observed in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RNA similar to or different from that in DNA? 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. A certain protein has this structure, where a line indicates a hydrophilic region and a box represents
 
 
a hydrophobic region.

Hydrophilic 
 

i. 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Why do you think the protein might fold this way when dissolved in salt water? 

 

 

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.	  How do you think the protein might fold differently if it were dissolved in cooking oil? 
 

 
 
 
3. You are studying a protein that comes from a bacterial species that lives in your gut. This protein
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
also has enzymatic function. If you boil this protein, you will disrupt Hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
but not covalent bonds. If this enzyme is most active (100% active) in the cytoplasm of a bacterial cell 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(37oC) in your gut, what would be the effect of protease treatment on the activity of this protein?

4. Pepsin  is  a digestive  enzyme  that acts on proteins  in  stomach.  This  requires  the presence of HCl  for 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
its normal functioning. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.  What may be the type of reaction catalyzed by pepsin? 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pepsin  functions  well  in  the  stomach  but  it  ceases  to  function  in  the  intestine.  Explain  why
 
 
 
 
pepsin does not function in the intestine? 

ii.	 
 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. The formation, maturation and folding of secreted proteins takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and the golgi body. These steps normally occur without any error. However, very rarely a misfolded
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
protein may be produced which (if not destroyed) can lead to severe, life threatening diseases. How do
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the cells normally get rid of these misfolded proteins? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6. Enzymes, which are usually proteins, act as biological catalysts. Of the properties mentioned in the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
following table, state which are not changed by the enzymes. 
 
Does enzyme change this property (Yes/No)?

7. Working in a research lab you happen to identify a novel protein.  This protein serves as an enzyme, 
 
  
 
 
 
which catalyses the following reaction. 
  
 
 
  
           
  
A 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You observe that if you increase the concentration of substrate A, there occurs a simultaneous increase
 
in the rate of reaction, but only up to a certain point. Explain why.
