Summary of Lectur
Retinoblastoma:  This
  is  a  cancer  of  the  retina.  In  Familial  retinoblastoma,  multiple 
tumors  in  the  retinas
  of  both  eyes  occur  in  the  first  weeks  of  infancy  when  the  fetus 
inherits  from one of  it
s parents a chromosome  that has  its RB  locus deleted or otherwise 
mutated.  So  in  this  form  of  the disease,  a  germline mutation  plus  a  somatic mutation  of 
the second allele leads to the disease. In sporadic retinoblastoma  a single tumor appears 
in  one  eye  sometime  in  early  childhood  before  the  retina  is  fully  developed  and mitosis 
in it ceases. In this form, both inherited RB genes are normal and a single cell must be so 
unlucky  as  to  suffer  a  somatic  mutation  (often  a  deletion)  in  both  in  order  to  develop 
into  a  tumor.  Such  a  double  hit  is  an  exceedingly  improbable  event,  and  so  only  rarely 
will such a tumor occur.   
Cancer Therapy: Most cancer patients are treated with some combination of surgery, 
radiation, chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Radiation and chemotherapy have the 
disadvantage of destroying healthy as well as malignant cells and thus can cause severe 
side- effects. Drug design is a very expensive process.  Drugs must be specific (i.e. they 
can’t inhibit other proteins in addition to their targets or else they will cause side effects), 
must work at a low concentration (so that the amount that needs to be taken by the 
patient is feasible), and must not be metabolized by the patient either too quickly (so 
that taking the drug is ineffectual), too slowly, or into toxic byproducts. Gleevec is a 
drug that works against the type of cancer of the white blood cells called CML (chronic 
myelogenous leukemia).  Almost all patients with CML contain cancerous cells that 
harbor a mutation that is a translocation between chromosomes #9 and #22.  The genes 
at the two breakpoints of the translocation are Bcr and Abl (a kinase).  The translocation 
causes a fusion of these genes to be created, such that a chimeric protein is made that is 
one continuous protein, half of which looks like part of BCR and half of which looks like 
part of ABL.  The BCR-ABL fusion protein that is produced by this mutation functions 
aberrantly by phosphorylating proteins it normally shouldn’t, thereby activating the 
growth and division of white blood cells.  The drug Gleevec specifically inhibits the 
kinase activity of Abl, thereby ceasing the aberrant phosphorylation in CML patients 
and sending their cancer into remission.    
Viruses:  Viruses   are   obligate   intracellular   parasites.   They   consist   of   a   protein   coat  
surrounding   a   genome,   which   encodes   for   a   few   proteins   that   a   virus   needs.   These  
include   the   proteins   for   replication,   structural   or   coat   proteins,   other   proteins   necessary  
to  get  inside  the  host  cell  and  make  copies  of  viral  genome  and  the  proteins  that  provide  
the   virus   with   the   anti   –   host   defense   system.   Viruses   that   have   no   lipid   bilayer  
surrounding   their   coats   typically   dock   onto   some   protein   on   the   surface   of   cells   and  
inject   their   genomes   into   the   host.      Viruses   that   have   a   lipid   bilayer   surrounding   their  
coats   typically   fuse   their   own  membranes  with   the   host  membrane,   such   that   the   entire  
viral   particle   is   absorbed   or   endocytosed   into   the   host   cell.      Once   a   virus   is   inside   its  
host,   it   takes   over   the   host   machinery   and   uses   it   to   make   coat   proteins   and   viral  
genomes.      The   genomes   are   then   packaged   into   the   coats   and   the   new   viral   particles  
escape  from  the  host  cell  either  by  lysing  the  cell  or  budding  off  from  the  cell.  
  
Viral  genomes  can  be  single-­‐‑stranded  RNA,  single-­‐‑stranded  DNA,  double-­‐‑stranded  
RNA,  or  double-­‐‑stranded  DNA.  Retroviruses  are  viruses  whose  genomes  are  RNA  

 

3 

strands  that  are  converted  to  DNA  upon  entry  into  the  cell.    Retroviral  genomes  contain  
a  gene  that  encodes  the  enzyme  Reverse  Transcriptase  (RT).    Reverse  transcriptase  is  a  
DNA  polymerase  that  reads  a  strand  of  RNA  as  a  template,  and  synthesizes  the  
complementary  strand  of  DNA.    Retroviruses  use  RT  to  convert  their  RNA  genomes  into  
DNA  such  that  these  pieces  of  DNA  can  now  randomly  integrate  into  the  host  cell’s  
genome.    In  this  way,  the  virus  hides  out  in  a  chromosome  and  gets  replicated  and  
passed  on  to  all  daughter  cells  of  the  original  cell  it  infected.    
 
Questions: 
 1. Retinoblastoma is caused by the mutation in the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor 
gene. There are several mechanisms, which can cause a cell to lose its normal gene and 
thus be predisposed to develop into a tumor. These may result in a "loss of 
heterozygosity" or "LOH".  
 

§  What do you mean by LOH?  
 
§  Many clinicians and scientists are currently trying to develop cancer treatments 
that are more specific and targeted than chemotherapy. If a patient had a tumor 
that was caused in part by mutations in Rb. Do you think it would be a good 
therapeutic decision to provide this cancer patient with a wild-type copy of the 
Rb gene? 

2. Why  do  some  people  think  that  viruses  are  alive  and  some  people  don’t?  
  
  
4.  Could  you  treat  a  viral  infection  by  antibiotics  (Yes/No)?  Explain.  
  
5.  What  is  the  genetic  material    (DNA  /  RNA)  in  a  plus  and  minus  stranded  virus?  How  
does  a  plus  stranded  virus  differ  from  a      minus  stranded  virus?    
  
6.  The  following  sequence  is  a  short  viral  gene  from  a  double-­‐‑stranded  DNA  virus  that  
actually  encodes  three  different  proteins.    The  sequence  shown  is  from  the  transcription  
start  site  to  the  transcriptional  end  site.    The  upper  strand  of  this  gene  is  used  as  a  
template  in  transcription.

i.  How  do  you  know  that  it  is  true  that  these  three  short  proteins  are  not  produced  
from  alternative  splicing  of  a  single  transcript?  

ii.  How  many  amino  acids  long  would  each  of  the  three  proteins  be  that  are  
produced  from  this  gene?

iv.  What  is  a  major  disadvantage  for  the  virus  to  using  this  strategy?
