1.  Below  is  pictured  the  nucleus  from  a  skin  cell  taken  from  a  mouse  (named  Mouse  #1),  with  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
chromosomes shown in bold.
 
 
a) Is the cell haploid or diploid?

 
 
 
 
  
 
It is diploid since the chromosomes are present in pairs.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) Let’s say we blew up a region of the longest chromosome to look at its sequence at one small gene.

Is Mouse #1 homozygous or heterozygous for this gene?

Mitosis 
 

 
It is homozygous since the sequence on the two homologous chromosomes provided in the schematic above is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
identical. 
 
 

 

iv.	  Now we zoom in on the same exact gene on the long chromosome in a cell from a mouse named
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mouse #2 and find that its two homologous chromosomes have the sequences:

Sequence 2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
How might we write the genotypes of Mouse #1 and Mouse #2 if Sequence #1 encodes a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
functional protein but Sequence #2 encodes a protein that no longer works? (Note: Use the upper 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
case or lowercase A while writing the genotypes).
Mouse #1 = AA 
 
 
 
 
 
Mouse #2: Aa

2. Consider  a  humming  bird whose  body  color  is  controlled  by  the  B  gene.  These  humming  birds  are 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
either  green  or  yellow,  where  green  color  is  dominant  to  yellow.  Give  the  expected  ratio  (both 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phenotypes and genotypes) of the offspring for the following crosses.

3. In a diploid cell (2n), that is undergoing cell division, draw a graph showing the variation in the

4. A schematic of a diploid nucleus prior to DNA replication is drawn below.  It contains two pairs of 
  
 
 
chromosomes (2n = 4). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The genotype of the cell above is DdEeFf, where the D and E loci are on the large chromosome and the
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
F locus is on the small chromosome.  This cell was taken from an F1 organism that resulted from the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
cross of two true-breeding parents such that Parent 1 is  DDeeFF and Parent 2 is ddEEff. Draw and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
align the chromosomes as they could be when in metaphase of meiosis I. Include the D, d, E, e, F, and f
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
alleles on the drawing and assume no recombination. Given your drawing, draw the chromosomes in 
each of the two products resulting from meiosis I. Include the D, d, E, e, F, and f alleles on the drawing.

5. Tomato plants can be tall or short and have notched or smooth leaves. You cross a tall, smooth 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
leafed plant with a short, notched leafed plant.  All of the progeny are tall, and notched leafed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a) Which traits are dominant and which are recessive?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dominant traits are tall and notched whereas the recessive traits are short and smooth. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) What are the genotypes of the two true-breeding parents?  Use the letters H or h to represent the alleles
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the height gene and the letters S or s to represent the alleles of the leaf gene.  In each case, use the uppercase

Tall, smooth leaf parent plant will have the genotype HHss whereas short, notched leaf parent plant will have the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
genotype hhSS.

If these two traits are unlinked, what ratio of phenotype do you expect in the F2 generation? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iv.	 
 
Note: This is a practice question related to lecture 8.

6. In fruit flies, the “B/b” gene and the “G/g” gene are linked.  In one specific fly whose genotype is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
GgBb, “B” is linked to “g” on the maternal chromosome #2, and “b” is linked to “G” on the paternal
 
   
 
 
chromosome #2. Note: This is a practice question related to lecture 8. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
List all parental type (non-recombinant) gametes by genotype that could be produced by this 
i.	 
 
  
 
GgBb fly.
 
 
 
 
Non-recombinant gametes are Bg and bG. 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii. 	 
List all recombinant gametes by genotype that could be produced by this GgBb fly.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Recombinant gametes are BG and bg. 
 

  

iii.	 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Say that 40% of all gametes produced by the GgBb fly are “Bg.”  What percentage of all gametes 
  
 
 
 
 
produced by this fly are recombinants?
 
 
 
 
 
 
20% of the gametes are recombinants.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iv.	  As the recombination frequency between two genes on the same chromosome rises, does the

 
physical distance between those two genes lower or rise?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Physical distance is directly proportional to the recombination frequency. So the distance increases with the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increase in recombination frequency.
