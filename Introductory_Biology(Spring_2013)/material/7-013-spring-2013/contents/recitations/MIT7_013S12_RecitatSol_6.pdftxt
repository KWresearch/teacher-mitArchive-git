Questions 
 
 
 
1. Say you wanted to replicate the following piece of DNA: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 
5’-GTACGTTTACGCCGTATATATCGTCGTAATGCTACGTAGCTCTACGAACA-3’ 
 
3’-CATGCAAATGCGGCATATATAGCAGCATTACGATGCATCGAGATGCTTGT-5’ 
 
 
a) Design a 10-bp-long primer you would use to generate a new copy of the entire bottom strand of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DNA. Label the 5’ and 3’ ends of the primer.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5’-TGTTCGTAGA-3’ (replace Ts by Us)
 
 
 
b) In what direction does the new strand of DNA get synthesized?  5’→3’ 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) In what direction is the template strand for DNA synthesis read? 3’→5’ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d) In the cell during DNA replication, the cell is not heated up each time to denature the original 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
duplex.  How does the cell separate the two strands of its double-stranded DNA during DNA
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
replication?
 
In a cell, the two strands of the DNA duplex are separated by the action of helicase enzyme and stabilized by
   
single stranded DNA binding proteins. 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Consider the following segment of the DNA that is a part of a much larger molecule constituting a
chromosome. The sequence of region 1 is shown below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Region 1 
 
Region 1:	 
 
 
 
5’…ATTCGTACGATCGACTGACTGACAGTC…3’ 
 
3’…TAAGCATGCTAGCTGACTGACTGTCAG…5’ 
 
 
 
 
 
a) If we assume that a fragment of the lagging strand is made from region 1, what will be its sequence?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Label the 5’ and the 3’ ends. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5’…ATTCGTACGATCGACTGACTGACAGTC…3’ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) Why is DNA synthesis continuous at one strand and discontinuous at the other strand?
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This is because the two strands of DNA duplex are anti-parallel but the replication always occurs in a 5’→3’. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Accordingly, the synthesis is continuous at one strand and discontinuous at the other strand. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) State the three major processes of DNA repair, which you were introduced to in 7.013 lecture. 
 
 
 
 
 
•  3’→5’ exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase, 
 
  
 
 
excision repair and 
 
• 
 
 
 
•  mismatch repair mechanisms.

3. The following is a partial sequence from the hypothetical gene, gene X.  The boxed region is the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
promoter, and the direction of transcription is indicated by the arrow. Transcription begins at and 
 
 
 
 
includes the first G/C base pair after the box.

What are the first 10 nucleotides of the mRNA produced from gene X?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the sequence above the top strand is the template strand for transcription that always proceeds in a
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5’→3’direction. Therefore the first 10 nucleotides of the mRNA will be 5’CUUCCAUCCA3’.
