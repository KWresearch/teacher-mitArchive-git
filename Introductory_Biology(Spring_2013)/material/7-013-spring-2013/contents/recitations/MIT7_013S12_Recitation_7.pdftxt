Summary of Lecture 12:
Splicing: Splicing (which occurs in eukaryotic cells) is the process by which pieces of an mRNA
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
initially transcribed from a gene are removed from the initial transcript to form the final, shorter
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transcript.  These pieces, called introns, are regions of mRNA that do not code for protein.  The final 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mRNA transcript after splicing consists only of the exons (i.e. the protein-coding regions) sandwiched
 
 
 
 
 
 
between the 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions. 
 
Epigenetics: This is the regulation of transcription that is not dependent upon the DNA sequence.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Epigenetics depends upon chromatin, and the chromatin is influenced by methylation of DNA.
 
Methylation of DNA inhibits transcription, and the pattern of methylation of DNA varies depending
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on cell type and cell age. The embryo produced via somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) will have the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
methylation pattern that is normal for the cell that donated the nucleus, but this pattern is not the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
normal embryonic pattern, and clones produced by SCNT are usually abnormal. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Questions: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Shown below is the genomic structure of the human b-globin gene. The numbers within the boxes
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
indicate the length (in nucleotides) of each region. The DNA sequences corresponding to the start
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
codon and the stop codon are indicated.

What is the length (in nucleotides) of the mature, processed b-globin mRNA? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
2.  The mature mRNA sequence has some nucleotides that are not represented in the template strand of
 
  
 
 
the genomic DNA sequence.

3. How does the chromatin structure of a stem cell/ progenitor cell cell differ from that of a highly
 
differentiated cell?
