Summary of Lectures 10 & 11: 
 
 
Replication: The process of DNA replication occurs when two double-stranded DNA molecules are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
made from one double-stranded DNA molecule.  This process occurs only in actively dividing cells 
 
because DNA replication always precedes cell division.  The enzyme that catalyzes DNA replication is 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
the protein DNA polymerase.  DNA polymerase catalyzes the reaction of forming a phosphodiester
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
bond between two deoxyribonucleotides.  The start signal for DNA polymerase is an origin of
replication, which is a site on DNA that may or may not be inside a gene.  DNA polymerase proceeds 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
down a piece of DNA until the entire genome is replicated.  The new strands are synthesized in the 5’
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to 3’ direction. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
DNA replication occurs in a semi-conservative fashion.  This means that, when one double-stranded
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
molecule of DNA is replicated, the original double-stranded molecule is unraveled such that it is two
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
separate “old” strands.  Then each “old” strand acts as a template for one “new” strand.  At the end of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
replication, each of the two new double-stranded molecules consists of one “old” strand running
 
 
 
antiparallel to one “new” strand. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Besides DNA polymerase, two other enzymes play critical roles in DNA replication. Helicase unwinds
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the two strands of DNA such that they can be replicated.  DNA ligase catalyzes the formation of a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
covalent bond between two adjacent nucleotides, and is used to seal the gap between the replicated
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
fragments of DNA that are produced on the lagging strands of a replication fork.  The leading strand is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the strand that is being replicated in the same direction that the fork is being unraveled by helicase;
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
thus DNA polymerase can just replicate this strand is one long continuous piece.  The lagging strand is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
being replicated in the opposite direction that the fork is being unraveled, so DNA polymerase has to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
constantly hop on, replicate a piece, and then fall off and hop back on again.  This leads to the strand 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
being replicated in pieces that must be joined together by DNA ligase. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mutations in DNA can be repaired by the proofreading mechanism of DNA polymerase (this works
 
 
 
 
 
during replication), mismatch repair and excision repair mechanisms. 
 
Transcription: The process of transcription occurs when a double-stranded DNA is unwound and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
one strand is transcribed to make RNA.  The RNA that is transcribed from a gene can be one of three 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
types of RNA: mRNA, tRNA or rRNA.  All of these types of RNA are identical in their chemical
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
composition, but they differ in their function.  mRNAs are transcribed from genes that encode proteins;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
these mRNAs will go on to be translated by ribosomes.  The rRNAs and tRNAs are transcribed directly
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from their respective genes, but they are never translated.  Instead, they participate in the process of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
translating mRNAs. The  rRNAs complex with ribosomal proteins to form the ribosome.  Each tRNA 
 
becomes covalently attached to the correct amino acid, and then donates that amino acid to the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ribosome whenever that amino acid is needed for translation of a protein.

d) In the cell during DNA replication, the cell is not heated up each time to denature the original
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
duplex.  How does the cell separate the two strands of its double-stranded DNA during DNA
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
replication?
