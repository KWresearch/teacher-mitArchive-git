Summary of Lecture 1: 
 
 
Origin of life: its unity and diversity: It is thought that earth evolved about 5 billion years ago and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was inhabitable for the first 1 billion years.  As earth cooled down, organic molecules were formed and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
the first evidence of life (prokaryotes) appeared about 3.8 billion years ago in oceans.  Photosynthetic
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
organisms likely originated about 2.5 billion years ago.  These organisms increased the oxygen
 
 
 
concentration on earth and influenced the evolution of multi-cellular aerobic organisms about 1 billion
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
years ago. The true multi-cellular organisms evolved about 500 million years ago. The organisms today
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are classified into three major domains; bacteria, archaea and eukarya. Of these bacteria and archaea 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are unicellular and prokaryotic (without nucleus) whereas eukarya are nucleated and mostly multi-
 
cellular. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Because all living organisms have originated from a common ancestor they share a genetic makeup and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are comprised of cells as their building blocks. Many of the processes that occur in the simplest of cells
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
also occur in complex organisms.  The examples of such processes are replication (making DNA from
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DNA), transcription (making RNA from DNA) and translation (making proteins from mRNA) etc.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thus, biologists can use model systems such as bacteria, yeast, flies and mice for their research
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
knowing that they can extend their conclusions to other organisms including the human beings. 
 
Questions:
 
 
1. Organisms such as bacteria, yeasts, flies, mice and rabbits are used as model systems for different
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
biological experiments. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.  Classify each of the above organisms as prokaryotic or eukaryotic. 
 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.  Classify each of the above organisms as unicellular or multi-cellular. 
 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Human beings are complex multi-cellular organisms made of different cell types each responsible for 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
specialized function. Compare three cell types: retinal cells, skin cells and unfertilized ova. 
 
i.  Do all these cell types have the same set of genes and same number of chromosomes? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.  Are the genes expressed in the unfertilized egg same as the genes in the retinal cells? 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iii.  Are the proteins in the retinal cells the same as the proteins in the skin cells?
