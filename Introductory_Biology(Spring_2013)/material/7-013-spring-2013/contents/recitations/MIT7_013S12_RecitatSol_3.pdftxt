1. Nucleic acids are of two major types: double helical DNA and single stranded RNA.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.	  Draw the chemical structure of a DNA molecule composed of three deoxy-ribonucleotides.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Label the 3’ and 5’ ends. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
5’ 

  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
3’ 

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
ii.  How is a nucleotide different from a nucleoside? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A nucleoside is comprised of a nucleic acid base (A, T, G, C, U) and ribose/deoxyribose sugar. In comparison, the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
nucleotide has the base, sugar and the phosphate group. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iii.  Why the two strands of DNA are anti-parallel to each other?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
   
The anti-parallel arrangement of the two strands in a DNA duplex allows the complementary bases to stack in a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
manner that allows them to hydrogen bond with each other. This arrangement also ensures that both the strands
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
replicate in a 5’→3’ direction (you will learn more about this in your Molecular biology lectures). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iv.  Why is RNA more reactive compared to a DNA?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The extra –OH group at the 2’C of the ribose sugar allows RNA to be more reactive compared to DNA.

v.	 
 

RNA is single stranded. However, it can have a very complex three-dimensional structure.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Certain regions of RNA may show intra- molecular base pairing. Is the base pairing observed in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RNA similar to or different from that in DNA? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Yes, the intra-molecular base pairing in RNA follows the same complementary base-pairing rule as DNA where
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A forms two hydrogen bonds with U and C forms three hydrogen bonds with G. 
 
2. A certain protein has this structure, where a line indicates a hydrophilic region and a box represents
 
 
a hydrophobic region. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iii.  Why do you think the protein might fold this way when dissolved in salt water?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The boxed hydrophobic regions try to hide in the non-aqueous interior away from the surrounding hydrophilic 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
environment of the salt water. In comparison, the hydrophilic regions, shown by the lines, remain exposed to the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
salt water and may from hydrogen bonds and / or ionic bonds with the molecules in the surrounding
 
environment.

iv.  How do you think the protein might fold differently if it were dissolved in cooking oil?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The folding will be reversed. The boxed hydrophobic regions will be exposed and may undergo hydrophobic 
interaction with the surrounding hydrophobic environment whereas the hydrophilic regions, shown by the lines, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
will be hidden in the interior away from the surrounding hydrophobic environment. 
 
3. You are studying a protein that comes from a bacterial species that lives in your gut. This protein 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
also has enzymatic function. If you boil this protein, you will disrupt Hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
but not covalent bonds. If this enzyme is most active (100% active) in the cytoplasm of a bacterial cell 
 
(37oC) in your gut, what would be the effect of protease treatment on the activity of this protein?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Protease treatment will cleave the covalent peptide bonds that hold the amino acids of the proteins one after the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
other to form its primary structure. The effect of such treatment is irreversible since the primary structure of the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
protein is disrupted. 
 
 
 
 
4. Pepsin  is  a digestive  enzyme  that acts on proteins  in  stomach.  This  requires  the presence of HCl  for 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
its normal functioning. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iii.	  What may be the type of reaction catalyzed by pepsin?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pepsin digests the proteins to small polypeptides at acidic pH. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iv.	 
Pepsin  functions  well  in  the  stomach  but  it  ceases  to  function  in  the  intestine.  Explain  why
 
 
 
 
 
pepsin does not function in the intestine?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Each  enzyme maintains  its  active  three-dimensional  conformation  at  a  specific pH. The  acidic pH  in  the  stomach 
 
is the required pH for pepsin activity whereas the alkaline pH of the intestine is not. 
 
 
 
 
5. The formation, maturation and folding of secreted proteins takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and the golgi body. These steps normally occur without any error. However, very rarely a misfolded
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
protein may be produced which (if not destroyed) can lead to severe, life threatening diseases. How do
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the cells normally get rid of these misfolded proteins?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The misfolded proteins are degraded by the lysosomal enzymes. Alternatively, they may bind to heat shock
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
proteins, which act as molecular chaperons to cage the misfolded proteins.

6.  Enzymes, which  are  usually  proteins,  act  as  biological  catalysts. Of  the  properties mentioned  in  the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
following table, state which are not changed by the enzymes. 
 
Does enzyme change this property (Yes/No)?

7. Working in a research lab you happen to identify a novel protein.  This protein serves as an enzyme, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
which catalyses the following reaction. 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You observe that if you increase the concentration of substrate A, there occurs a simultaneous increase
 
in the rate of reaction, but only up to a certain point. Explain why. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you increase the substrate concentration, more substrate molecules will be available to bind to the active site of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the enzyme and get converted to products B and C. This causes an initial increase in the rate of enzyme-catalyzed
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reaction. However, after some time, the active sites of all the available enzyme molecules are already saturated
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
with the substrate molecules i.e. enzyme itself becomes a limiting factor. At this point, even if the substrate
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concentration is increased, there occurs no further increase in the rate of reaction i.e. reaction rate reaches a 
 
 
 
plateau phase.
