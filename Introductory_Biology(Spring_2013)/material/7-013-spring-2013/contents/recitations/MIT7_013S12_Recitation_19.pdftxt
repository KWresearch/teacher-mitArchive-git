  Summary  from  Lectures  #33-­‐‑35:  
HIV is a retrovirus that infects the TH cells of our immune system.  HIV gets into our TH 
cells by docking onto a protein called CD4 that our TH cells have on their surface.  Our 
TH cells have CD4 on their surfaces because CD4 helps TH cells recognize the MHC class 
II molecules on the surface of macrophages, which is the job of a TH cell.  However the 
HIV virus has evolved to have a glycoprotein on its surface that binds to CD4, thus 
targeting HIV to TH cells.  This glycoprotein also has the ability to fuse the lipid bilayer 
of HIV to the cell membrane of our TH cells, thus dumping the contents of the HIV virus 
into our TH cells.  The HIV virus harms our TH cells, thereby depleting our immune 
system and therefore our ability to fight the virus.  HIV also mutates very quickly due to 
it having a reverse transcriptase that is highly mutagenic.  This allows the HIV to be 
constantly changing the amino acid makeup and the shape of its viral proteins so that 
our immune system cannot gain immunity to the HIV.    
SCNT: This is the regulation of transcription that is not dependent upon the DNA 
sequence. Epigenetics depends upon chromatin, and the chromatin is influenced by 
methylation of DNA.  Methylation of DNA inhibits transcription, and the pattern of 
methylation of DNA varies depending on cell type and cell age. The embryo produced 
via somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) will have the methylation pattern that is normal 
for the cell that donated the nucleus, but this pattern is not the normal embryonic 
pattern, and clones produced by SCNT are usually abnormal.     
  
Microarrays: Not all cancers respond equally well to all treatments, so knowing the 
specific type or subtype of cancer is important to successful treatment. Some cancers can 
be identified by using histological tools, but other are best characterized by determining 
the gene expression profile. A DNA microarray is a multiplex technology that allows 
comparison of cells based upon the expression of many different genes. A DNA 
microarray consists of an arrayed series of thousands of microscopic spots of DNA, each 
spot representing a gene. When a DNA microarray is probed with mRNA isolated from 
cells, individual mRNA molecules will hybridize to the appropriate DNA spot. If a gene 
is highly expressed, more mRNA will be made from that gene, so more mRNA will 
hybridize to the corresponding DNA spot, and the signal from that spot will be greater. 
 
Environmental  toxins:  Although  there  are  approximately  200,000  FDA  approved 
compounds only  few have been  tested  for  toxicity. One  such  compound  is Bisphenol A, 
which  is  a  present  in  plastics  and  can  mimic  the  effect  of  estrogen  a  steroid  hormone. 
Exposure  to  this  compound  has  been  shown  to  suppress  fertility,  cause  cancer  and  also 
heart  disorders  in multiple  species.  This  clearly  demonstrates  the  importance  of  testing 
compounds for their potential toxicity. 
 
Human  genome  project:  Part  1  of  this  project  has  been  completed  and  we  now  know 
there  are  20,000  genes  in  our  genome.  We  also  know  the  protein  coding  regions  of  the 
gene.  The  2nd  part  of  Human  genome  project  marks  the  era  of  new  genetics  and  is  an 
attempt  to  find  out  the  disease  genes  alleles  (approximately  70,000  caused  by  the 
changes  in  the  human  genome),  describe  all  possible  RNAs  (2X106  approximately), 
identify  different  proteins,  protein  modifications,  DNA-protein  and  protein  –protein 
interactions.  This 
is  enormous 
information  and  requires  advanced 
information 
processing  and  data  storage  programs  and  rapid  and  cheaper  technology  for

sequencing.As  an  outcome  of  new  genetics  we  now  know  that  our  genome  is  really 
changeable  i.e.  big  chunks  of  chromosomes  flanked  by  direct  repeats  (50-150  bp  long/ 
hot spots) can either be deleted or duplicated by unequal crossing over. This can help us 
better understand diseases like cancer, autism, schizophrenia etc. 
 
Organ  repair  and  replacement:    There  are  about  1  million  people  who  need  organ 
transplant  or  repair.  This  problem  is  being  dealt  with  in  different  ways  some  of  which 
are described below. 
 
Artificial  organs:   Here  there  is  really  no  biological  material.  A  good  example  is  the 
foldable  polyacrobate  hydrogel  lens, which  is  being  used  during  cataract  surgery.  Limb 
replacement  (uses  artificial  limbs  made  of  titanium  alloys)  is  also  very  successful. 
However, they come with a drawback since they are never connected to the neurons and 
can  therefore  not  be  controlled  by  the  brain.Bionic  organs:  These  are  combination  of 
synthetic  and  natural  organs.  A  good  example  is  the  formation  of  3D-  micropatterned 
scaffold  of  hepatocytes, which make  the  liver.  Xenografts:  This  represents  other  species 
i.e. pigs as donor for organ transplant. This has been a big failure because of hyper acute 
rejection  of  the  organs  by  the  recipient.  One  major  issue  with  xenografts  is  the  concern 
that  other  species  may  have  viruses  for  which  the  humans  have  no  immunity.  These 
viruses may have devastating effect on organ recipients. 
  
Prions (Optional lecture, not a part of the final exam): These are the infective 
proteinaceous particles.  The diseases caused by prions are caused by the defective 
proteins. The defects arise not from the mutations in the genes that express these 
proteins, but from errors in the folding of these proteins into the proper three 
dimensional conformation.  The protein with the altered conformation then seems to 
induce a change in the conformation of the normal protein counterpart so that it also 
becomes abnormal.  The altered proteins have profound effects on its function in the cell.  
There is a long period of several years between the onset of the disease and the 
manifestations of the disease symptoms. Prions unlike the bacteria, viruses or nucleic 
acids cannot be altered or killed through UV irradiation. The transmissible spongiform 
encephalopathies (TSE), scrapie, kuru, mad cow disease and chronic wasting disease are 
some examples of prion related diseases.  
  
Questions:  
  
1.  What  components  does  the  virus  bring  in  at  the  time  of  infection?  
  
  
2.  Why  do  HIV  patients  succumb  to  simplistic  infections?    
  
  
3.  Why  are  HIV  patients  given  combination  therapy?
