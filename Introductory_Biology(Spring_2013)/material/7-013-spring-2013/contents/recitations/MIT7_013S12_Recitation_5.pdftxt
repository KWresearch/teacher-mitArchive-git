Summary of Lectures 8 & 9: 
 
 
 
Pedigrees: A pedigree shows how a trait runs through a family.  A person displaying the trait is 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
indicated by a filled in circle (female) or square (male).  Simple human traits that are determined by a 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
single gene display one of four modes of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-
   
 
 
 
  
 
linked dominant or X-linked recessive.  Autosomal traits are due to genes that lie on chromosomes #1 -
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
#22.  X-linked traits are due to genes that lie on the X chromosome.  Females are diploid for X-linked 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
genes, but males are haploid.  For a male to show an X-linked recessive trait, he only needs to inherit
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the X-linked allele from his mother, making X-linked recessive traits more common in males. The
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
females are usually the carriers. X linked dominant inheritance is extremely rare. 
 
Cell and its organelles: The cell is the smallest unit that displays the properties of life. All living cells
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have a plasma membrane, an internal region called cytoplasm and a region where DNA is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concentrated. A plasma membrane is comprised of a lipid bilayer (predominantly phospholipids) with
 
 
 
 
 
   
proteins embedded in it. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bacteria and Archaea are prokaryotic cells. They have no nucleus and are small, structurally simple
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cells. However, as a group they show the most diversity. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus and other organelles.  Organelles create physically distinct regions of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the cell. The nucleus is a membrane-bound compartment that separates the DNA from the cytoplasm.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pores across the nuclear membrane help control the passage of many substances between the nucleus 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and the cytoplasm. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a membrane bound region where polypeptide 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
chains are processed (Rough ER) and lipids are assembled (Smooth ER). Golgi bodies further modify
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
many of the proteins and lipids. Mitochondria in eukaryotic cells serve as the power- house of energy.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Unlike any other organelle the mitochondria have their own DNA and proteins. Eukaryotic cells have a
 
 
 
cytoskeleton of microtubules, microfilaments and intermediate filaments. The cytoskeleton imparts
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
shape to the cell, supports and moves cell organelles, motile structures and often the cell as a whole. 
 
Questions 
 
 
1. In the box below, write the most likely mode of inheritance of the following pedigree? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
5               6                           7          8 
 
 
? 
 
Given each consistent mode of inheritance, if the couple in question decides to have a child, what is the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
probability of that child being affected?  (Note: Use the uppercase or lowercase A to represent the alleles for 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the dominant and recessive traits).

2.  Consider  the  pedigree  below  showing  the  inheritance  of  two  X-linked  diseases,  hemophilia  A  and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hemophilia B. Hemophilia A  is due to a  lack of one clotting factor, and hemophilia B  is due to a  lack of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a different  clotting  factor. Each  clotting  factor  is a protein  that  is  encoded by  a  specific gene  located on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the X chromosome. Note that no individual shown in this pedigree is affected with both hemophilia
 
 
 
 
 
A and hemophila B.

a) Write the genotypes for the following individuals at both the hemophilia A and hemophilia B
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disease loci. Clearly define your genotype symbols.
