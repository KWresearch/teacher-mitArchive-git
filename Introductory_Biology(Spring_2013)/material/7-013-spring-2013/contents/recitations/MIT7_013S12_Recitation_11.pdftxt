Summary of Lectures 18: 
 
 
 
 
Protein Trafficking and Localization: The proteins undergo different types of post-translational
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
modification i.e. cleavage of signal peptide, glycosylation (addition of carbohydrate moiety that occurs
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in golgi bodies), phosphorylation (addition of phosphate group) and lipid addition. Each protein
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
contains an inherent signal sequence that serves as a zip code for the translocation of a protein to its 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
specific destination. Proteins going to the specific organelles have a short stretch of amino acids that 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
allows them to bind to docking protein receptors present on the membranes of appropriate organelles
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i.e. nuclear localization signal for nuclear proteins). The proteins in the cytosol have no signal
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sequence. The transmembrane proteins have a stretch of 15- 20 hydrophobic amino acids as their signal 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sequence.  This signal sequence is bound by a signal recognition particle (SRP), the SRP aids in the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
docking of the nascent polypeptide to the ER receptor. The signal sequence then enters the ER lumen
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by passing through a channel in the receptor. The signal sequence is then removed and the protein 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
synthesis once again resumes. The protein is transported to the membrane via ER, golgi body and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
vesicles that fuse with membrane.  Protein localization can be determined by techniques such as 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fluorescence imaging or by creating a fluorescent protein. 
 
 
Questions
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. You are interested in four different proteins in a yeast cell: protein 1 is a cytosolic protein, protein 2 is 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a secreted protein, protein 3 is a nuclear protein and protein 4 is a transmembrane protein. You plan to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
study how the proteins are localized to their specific destination by creating the following mutations in
 
  
 
 
 
the genes encoding proteins 1-4. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.	  Mutation A inactivates the SRP (signal recognition particle). Indicate how the localization of each
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
protein (1-4) will be affected by this mutation. In addition, state whether each protein will
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
function as it does in a wild-type cell. 

 

 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.	  Mutation B removes the signal sequence from protein 2. Indicate how the localization of each

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
protein (1-4) will be affected by this mutation. In addition, state whether each protein will 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
function as it does in a wild-type cell.
 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iii.	  Mutation C removes the signal sequence from protein 4. Indicate how the localization of each

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
protein (1-4) will be affected by this mutation. In additional state whether each protein will 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
function as it does in a wild-type cell.
 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iv.	  Mutation D prevents the fusion of vesicles to the golgi body membrane. Indicate how the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
localization of each protein (1-4) will be affected by this mutation. In addition, state whether

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
each protein will function as it does in a wild-type cell.
