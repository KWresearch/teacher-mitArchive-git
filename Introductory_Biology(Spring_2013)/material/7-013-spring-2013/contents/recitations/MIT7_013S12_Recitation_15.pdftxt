Summary of Lectures 24 & 25
 
 
 
The  immune  system  protects  the  body  from  foreign  entities  that  have  invaded  it,  such  as  bacteria  and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
viruses.  It  does  so  by making  proteins  called  antibodies,  which  recognize  and  direct  an  attack  against
 
 
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
foreign  entities,  which  are  often  called  antigens.  A  person’s  body  produces  billions  of  different 
 
antibodies.  Many of these randomly generated antibodies have the potential to recognize proteins that
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are  made  in  one’s  own  body.  The  immune  system  however  has  a  way  of  distinguishing  antibodies
       
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that act against “self” antigens from that against “non-self / foreign” antigens.  It does so by destroying
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or preventing the proliferation of any antibody-producing cell that recognizes a self-made antigen. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our bodies make billions of different antibodies. These are proteins and thus are encoded by genes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, our genomes contain less than 30,000 genes. So it is not possible that we would have a
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
different gene to encode for each different antibody that we generate.  The explanation for this is that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
there is a cluster of segments of genes (called V, D, and J segments) in the section of the genome that 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
encodes antibodies.  Every antibody-producing cell rearranges these DNA segments to join one V
 
 
   
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
segment to one D segment to one J segment, thereby creating one gene that makes one antibody.  Every 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
different antibody-producing cell rearranges this cluster of DNA segments differently. Thus all
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
antibody-producing cells contain only one gene that encodes an antibody, but every cell contains a
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
different arrangement of that gene thus leading to antibody diversity.  Other than cells of immune 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
system, every cell in your body contains the exact same DNA as every other cell because no such 
 
 
rearrangement occurs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  immune  system  provides humoral  and  innate  immunity. There  are  three  important  cell  types  that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
play  critical  roles  in  the  humoral  arm  of  the  immune  system  –  phagocytic  cells,  B  cells  and  helper  T 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
 
 
cells  (TH).  When  a  phagocytic  cell  encounters  a  foreign  particle  in  the  body,  it  eats  that  particle  and 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
displays  pieces  of  the  particle  on  its  surface  using  the  cell-surface  display  protein MHC  class  II.  A  TH 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
cell has a protein on  its cell surface called  T cell receptor  (TCR).  Every TH  cell has a different TCR  that 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recognizes  a  different  antigen  (because  every  TH  cell  rearranges  the  TCR  gene  in  the  genome 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
differently,  in a mechanism  similar  to VDJ  joining).  If a TH  cell encounters a phagocytic cell displaying 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
the  antigen  recognized  by  its  own  TCR,  then  that  TH  cell  undergoes  clonal  expansion.  The  many  TH 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cells of this kind then go searching for a B cell that recognizes the same antigen as that TH  cell.  If the TH 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cells  find  the  right  B  cell,  then  that  B  cell  undergoes  a  clonal  expansion.  These  B  cells  make  secreted 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
antibody that recognizes and attack the foreign antigen. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  immune  system  displays  memory;  we  know  this  because  the  second  time  the  immune  system
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
encounters  an  antigen,  the  response  of  B  cells  and  T  cells  is  faster  and  stronger.  The  principle  behind
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vaccination  is  to  expose  an  organism  to  some  of  the  antigens  of  a  harmful  foreign  particle  that  will
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
spark  the  immune  system’s  memory  in  case  the  actual  entire  foreign  particle  ever  invades  that 
 
organism. 
 
Another  type  of  immunity  is  the  innate  immune  response.  This  response  is  however  not  antigen  – 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
specific  and  does  not  generate  immune  memory.  This  commences  immediately  upon  pathogen  entry
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and  involves  multiple  cell  types  such  as  macrophages  and  mast  cells.  If  these  cells  cannot  rapidly
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
eliminate pathogen, inflammation is induced with the synthesis of cytokines and acute phase proteins. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Questions 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Viral infections can be treated using anti-viral drugs, or they can be prevented in the first place 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
through the use of vaccines.  Some vaccines are just injections of viral particles that have been 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
inactivated in some way (such as extreme heat).  Other vaccines are injections of a single viral protein 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
that has been purified and produced using recombinant DNA techniques.  How does a vaccine work? 
 
 
 
2. Each one of your gametes contains 3 X 109  base pairs of DNA in its nucleus.  How many 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 
5
 

 

 
 
base pairs of DNA are contained within: 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
a) Each nerve cell? 
 
b) Each antibody-producing white blood cell? 
 
 
 
  
c) Each red blood cell? 
 
  
3. The cellular arm of the immune system employs cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Tc) and natural killer cells. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
The TC  cells can recognize the viral infected body cells. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
a)  What proteins are involved in the presentation of the antigen to the Tc lymphocytes? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
b) Explain why the Tc lymphocytes do not recognize an infected cell if the virus is latent 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
i.e. viral capsid protein does not occur. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. Shown below is a schematic of the production of a heavy chain polypeptide for an antibody.  At the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
top is the chromosomal arrangement found in an immature B cell, at the bottom is shown the heavy 
    
 
chain polypeptide. 
 
  
i.  Label the process indicated by each arrow.  Choose the one best option for each from: 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
homologous recombination, transcription , translation, translocation, ligation, DNA rearrangement, splicing 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
ii. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Indicate on the diagram below where you would expect to find each of the following 
  
components: 
Promoter (*) , Transcriptional terminator (1) , start codon (2) , stop codon (3) 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
iii. 
 
Indicate on the diagram below the variable and the constant region of the heavy chain 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
polypeptide and the N and C terminus of this polypeptide.
