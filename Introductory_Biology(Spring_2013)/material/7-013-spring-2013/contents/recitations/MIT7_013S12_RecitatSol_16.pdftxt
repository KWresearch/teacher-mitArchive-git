1. Shown below is a plot of axonal membrane potential as a function of time, measured at a single
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
position on the axon.

For each of the three time points indicated, fill in the following table.  Name the phase of membrane
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
potential that describes the time point, the channels/pumps that are involved, and explain how these
  
 
 
 
channels/pumps maintain that phase.

Na+/K+ pump

channels 
 

 
Na+/K+ pump creates a difference in concentration for both Na+ and
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
K+ across the cell membrane. The relative concentration of Na+ is high
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
outside as compared to inside and the relative concentration of K+ is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
low outside as compared to inside the cell. The open K+ channel always
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
allows K+ to flow out of the cell.  As K+ moves out of the cell, down its
 
 
concentration gradient, the inside of the cell becomes negative with
 
 
 
 
 
 
respect to the outside of the cell. K+
 
 
  
 
moves out of the cell until the driving force of the concentration
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
gradient equals the driving force of the
electrochemical gradient, which for most cells set the resting membrane 
 
 
 
 
 
 
potential at -70 mV.

2. Dopamine is one of major neurotransmitters in the mammalian brain that regulates mood, cognition and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
locomotion. Dopamine acts on two types of receptors:  the D1 receptor is an inhibitory ligand-gated channel,
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the D2 receptor activates the G proteins, and is excitatory. The released neurotransmitter is taken back into
 
 
 
 
 
the presynaptic cell, for re-use. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a) On what part of the neuron are the dopamine receptors localized?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The dopamine receptors are located on post-synaptic membrane. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) Is either D1 or D2 a metabotropic receptor? Explain.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Metabotropic receptors are not ion channels, but rather modulate the activity of ion channels through second
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
messengers. Since the D2 receptors act via G proteins, they are metabotropic receptors.

c) The D1 receptor is inhibitory and transports K+ ions. Would K+ be moved into or out of the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
postsynaptic cell? Explain the mechanism underlying this inhibitory effect.
 
 
At resting membrane potential the concentration of K+ is higher inside the cell compared to outside. The binding
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of dopamine to its D1 receptor will therefore move K+ ions out of the cell. As a result the membrane potential will
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be more negative relative to that at the resting state i.e. it is hyperpolarized, and further from threshold potential.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thus the chances of the post-synaptic neuron to fire an action potential will be reduced. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d) The D2 receptor is excitatory, and its ion targets are believed to include Ca2+. Would Ca2+ be
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
moved into or out of the postsynaptic cell?  Explain the mechanism underlying this excitatory effect.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  D2  receptors  will  promote  the  movement  of  Ca2+  ions  into  the  cell,  since  Ca2+  concentration  is  higher 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
outside  the  cell  than  inside.  Thus,  the  inside  of  the  cell  becomes more  positive  relative  to  the  unstimulated  state;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and the membrane potential will become closer to threshold potential and an action potential.
