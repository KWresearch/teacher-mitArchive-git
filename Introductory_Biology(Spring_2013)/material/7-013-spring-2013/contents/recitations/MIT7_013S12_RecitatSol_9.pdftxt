1. Three restriction enzymes have recognition sites in a plasmid:  EcoRI (“E”), HindIII (“H”), and XbaI
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(“X”).  You digest the plasmid with each of the following combinations of enzymes and see the
   
 
following gel.

restriction enzyme cuts at each site, and how far apart each cut site is.

2. What basic features should this plasmid have to serve as a vector?
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To clone a gene in a plasmid, the plasmid should have an origin of replication, a site that can serve as the
 
 
   
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
recognition sequence for restriction enzyme so that the plasmid can be cut open and used as a vector to clone the
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
desired sequence and a reporter gene (i.e. antibiotic resistant gene) that can be used to differentiate between the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
untransformed host cells and the host cells that have obtained the plasmid. (Note: If you also want to express the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gene you will need an appropriate promoter close to the 5’ end of the cloned gene so that the gene will be expressed 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and a transcription termination sequence close to 3’ end of the cloned gene to terminate transcription). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  Outline the basic steps involved in cloning a gene.
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
You cut the DNA fragment that you plan to clone by using a specific restriction enzyme. You also select an
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
appropriate plasmid that has been cut either by the same restriction enzyme or another enzyme that generates
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
complemenatry ends. You ligate the digested DNA fragments together by using a ligase enzyme. Once you have
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the recombinant plasmid with the DNA sequence of interest, you transform the plasmid into the bacterial cell (i.e.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
change the growth conditions to encourage the bacterial cells to take up recombinant plasmid). You then grow the

4.  You want to insert a specific yeast gene into a specific bacterial plasmid such that the yeast gene will
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be transcribed in the bacterial cell. Below is a restriction map of  a portion of yeast chromosome that

gene.

a) Your task is to design a strategy to insert the yeast gene into the bacterial plasmid. With which one 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
set of enzymes would you choose to cut the yeast genomic DNA and the plasmid, out of the following
choices?  Explain why you selected that pair.

(iv) XhoI & EcoRI 
(ii) SalI & KpnI 
(i) NdeI & XhoI 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Choice (i): Since you want to transcribe and express the yeast gene in the bacterial cells, you will need a bacterial

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
promoter (as shown on the plasmid). However if you use the restriction enzyme Nde1 and Xho 1 pair you will

 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
end up deleting this promoter (which you don’t want to do). So this is not a good choice. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Choice (ii): You will not use this pair since kpn1 restriction enzyme cuts within/ disrupts the open reading frame

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the yeast gene which you want to insert in the plasmid and express in the bacterial cells. 

 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
Choice (iii): This is a good choice for the reasons below.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you cut the yeast genomic DNA with Xho1 and Sal1 restriction enzyme you will have the following fragments.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) If you did the digestion and ligation with the two enzymes you chose above, in how many ways
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
could the insert be inserted into the vector? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You cut this portion of yeast genomic DNA with the Xho1 and Sal1 that have the following restriction
 
enzyme sites: 
  
 
 
 
 
 
So you get the following fragments.

Now you cut your plasmid with the same restriction enzyme pair (Sal1 and Xho1) to get the following
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ends as shown below

Fragment 2 can insert in the Xho1 and Sal1 digested plasmid vector in two different orientations as

Please look at the direction of transcription and the position of orientation. This will help you figure out
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that this is the reverse orientation of the yeast gene insert.

Please look at the direction of transcription and the position of orientation. This will help you figure out
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that this is the correct orientation of the yeast gene insert and this orientation it can be transcribed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) If the insert is inserted backwards, what would the DNA sequences be at the two sites where ligation
  
happened?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is the recombinant plasmid with the insert that is shown in the first orientation. 
 
 
 
d) Could the above sequence be cleaved by any of the 5 enzymes listed above?  No
