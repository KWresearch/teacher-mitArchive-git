Section 17 –  Solution key  

Questions:  
1.  Why  is c  ancer  predominantly  a  disease  of o  ld  age?   What a  bout t  he  usual cause  of 
cancer  makes it  more  common  in  older  people? 
Cancer  is  caused  by  multiple  mutations  inside  the  same  cell.  The  chances  of  a  single  cell  acquiring 
multiple  mutations  increase  as  the person a  ges.  
 
2. Why are the mutations that cause cancer generally not passed on to one’s offspring? 
Why  are  almost  all  cancers  sporadic  as  opposed  to  familial/inherited?) 
Most  of  these  mutations  are  the  mutations  in  the  somatic  cells  and  not  the  germline cells.  
 
3. Describe the basic principal behind the standard Ames test. How is this different from 
modified  Ames  test?  
The  standard  Ames  test  is  used  to  assess  the  mutagenic  potential  of  chemical  compounds.  The  test 
uses  several  strains  of  the  bacterium  that  carry mutations  in  genes  involved in  histidine 
synthesis,  so  that  they  require histidine for growth.  The variable being  tested  is the mutagen's 
ability  to cause  a reversion  to growth  on  a histidine-free medium. In the modified Ames test the 
rat  liver extract  is  added to  test  chemical  to  simulate  the  effect  of  metabolism.  Some  compounds, 
like benzopyrene, are not mutagenic themselves but their metabolic products are mutagenic. The 
mutagenicity  of  a  substance  is  proportional  to  the  number  of  bacterial  colonies  observed.  

4. What does it mean that a tumor is almost always clonal (or monoclonal)? 
Cancer  originates  due  to  multiple  mutations  in  a  single  cell.  Once  this  cell  becomes  cancerous  it 
multiplies  uncontrollably  to  form descendent  cells  that  are  the  clones  of  this  cell.  Therefore  it  is 
regarded  as clonal.  
 
5. Why is it that cancer cells containing mutations in genes encoding ECM (extracellular 
matrix)  proteins  are  more  dangerous  than  cancer  cells  with  normal  ECM  genes? 
These  cells  cannot  attach  to  the  matrix  and  are  free  to m 
igrate  and  metastasize.  
 
 
6. Weinberg’s famous experiment: Ras was the first oncogene to be discovered.  Ras is  
part  of  a  cell  signaling  pathway.   The  input  for  this  pathway  is  an extracellular  protein 
growth factor,  and  the  output  is  to  induce  transcription  of genes n  ecessary  for  the  cell 
cycle  to  occur.   Ras is a  GTPase  that  is active  in  the  GTP-bound  form  but  inactive  in the  
GDP-bound  form.   Ras  was  discovered  in the  Weinberg lab via  the  following 
experiment.   Human  tumor  DNA  was  cut into  pieces,  and  each  different piece  was p  ut 
into  a  different m  ouse  cell.   The  mouse  cells  were  then  grown  in  Petri plates.   Only  the 
mouse  cell  that  took  up  the  mutant  allele  of  the  oncogene  could  grow and  divide  enough 
to  form  a  colony  of cells.  
 
a)  Do you  think  that  the  mouse  cells  had  their  own  versions  of  Ras  before  the 
experiment  began?   If  yes,  do  you  think  that  the mouse versions  of  Ras  were wild-type 
or  mutant?  
Yes,  they  had  wild-type  versions  of  Ras  gene  before  the  experiment  was  done.

b) In this experiment, it seems that there was only one mutation necessary to make the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mouse cells over-proliferate.  We know, however, that cancer results from an 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
accumulation of mutations.  Why then did this experiment work?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
A cell line is already immortalized and is therefore predisposed to transformation unlike the wild-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
type cells. Hence a single mutation is enough to transform it to a cancerous cell line. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
   
 
 
c) If a patient had a tumor that was caused in part by mutations in Ras, do you think it
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
would be a good therapeutic decision to treat the cancer patient with a drug that targets
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and inhibits Ras? 
   
 
 
Most likely, yes, since oncogenic mutation is a gain-of-function mutation. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d) Do you think it would be a good therapeutic decision to provide this cancer patient 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with a wild-type copy of the Ras gene?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No, since adding a wild-type copy of Ras gene cannot suppress the phenotype caused by the gain-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
of-function mutation. 
 
 
e) Do you think that this experimental technique would work to identify tumor
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
suppressor genes?  Why or why not?
 
 
 
 
 
No, it would not work.  A mutation in a tumor suppressor gene is a homozygous loss-of-function
   
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
mutation. Therefore introducing a mutated copy of the tumor suppressor gene into the cells that
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have two wild-type copies of the same gene will not work (the effect of wild-type allele is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dominant to the mutated allele).
