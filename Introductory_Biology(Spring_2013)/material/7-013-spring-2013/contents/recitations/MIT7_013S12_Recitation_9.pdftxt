Summary of lectures 14 & 15:  
 
 
 
Cloning: Recombinant DNA is a DNA that contains fragments from two different organisms. The
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
common reagents necessary for recombinant DNA technology are restriction enzymes, DNA ligases 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and vectors. Restriction enzymes occur naturally in bacteria where they serve as a form of immune
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
system and have been co-opted by scientists for use in molecular biology. Restriction enzymes cut the
 
 
DNA by recognizing and binding to a specific restriction sites. DNA ligase is used by the cell during
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DNA replication to join the fragments that get replicated on the lagging strand. They can also be used
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to join the pieces of DNA that have been cut by the same restriction enzymes. Vectors are the pieces of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DNA that possess the qualities that allow any piece of DNA to be taken up by the cell and get
 
 
 
    
 
 
replicated using the cell replication machinery. 
 
 
 
  
The most common vector is a plasmid, which is a small circular double stranded DNA
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
molecule. Plasmids used as vectors to carry DNA into bacterial cell should have the following features:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a recognition sequence for a restriction enzyme such that you can cut the plasmid open with these 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enzymes and insert a piece of DNA into it, an origin of replication so that the plasmid can replicate
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
once it is within the bacterial cell and a reporter gene such as an antibiotic resistant gene that allows
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
you to select the bacterial cells that took up the plasmid. Once you have the recombinant plasmid with 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the DNA sequence of interest, you transform the plasmid into the bacterial cell (i.e. change the growth
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conditions to encourage the bacterial cells to take up recombinant plasmid). You then grow the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transformed bacteria on plates that contain specific antibiotic to which the genes on the plasmid confers
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
resistance. Any cell that took up the plasmid will grow on medium containing this antibiotic and those
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that did not take in the plasmid will die in the medium. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DNA gels: Gels are slabs of materials such as agarose and acrylamide that form gelatinous matrices
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
when polymerized.  DNA, RNA, and proteins can be inserted into such gels, the gels can be immersed
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in liquid, and then an electrical current can be applied to the gel such that these macromolecules move
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
towards the pole to which they are attracted.  Very long macromolecules will move slowly as they
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
attempt to weave their way through the pores in the gel.  Smaller macromolecules will move faster. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This technique of gel electrophoresis allows macromolecules to be separated by size. 
 
 
Questions:
1.Three restriction enzymes have recognition sites in a plasmid:  EcoRI (“E”), HindIII (“H”), and XbaI
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
(“X”).  You digest the plasmid with each of the following combinations of enzymes and see the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
   
 
following gel.

Draw a map of the plasmid indicating where each restriction enzyme cut site is, which restriction 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enzyme cuts at each site, and how far apart each cut site is.

2. What basic features should this plasmid have to serve as a vector? 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  Outline the basic steps involved in cloning a gene. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. You want to insert a specific yeast gene into a specific bacterial plasmid such that the yeast gene will
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be transcribed in the bacterial cell. Below is a restriction map of  a portion of yeast chromosome that
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
contains the yeast gene in which you are interested. The box indicates the open reading frame of this 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gene. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gene is normally transcribed this way:

ligation happened?
