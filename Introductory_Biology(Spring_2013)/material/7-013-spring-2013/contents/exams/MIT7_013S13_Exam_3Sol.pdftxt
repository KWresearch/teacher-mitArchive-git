Question 1 (20 points)

 
Diabetes occurs either due to a reduced insulin hormone production by the pancreatic β cells or the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
resistance of target cells to insulin. As shown by the schematic on Page 9, insulin signaling mediates

glucose uptake, protein synthesis, cell survival and proliferation. Note: You can detach Page 9.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a) Consider the following mutations in different components of insulin signaling. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. The kinase p70S6k  cannot bind to IRS. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  PI3 kinase (PI3K) cannot activate PDK.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. The promoter region of Akt gene has methylated cytosines (MeC). 
 
 
 
 
 
Complete the table for each of the above mutations relative to the wild-type cells in the presence of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Insulin. Note: Consider each mutation independently.

b) Although glucose is a small molecule it requires GLUT4 receptors to diffuse into the cell. Explain 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
why is this so.
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Glucose, being a monosaccharide, has multiple –OH groups that make it hydrophilic. So it cannot diffuse through

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the hydrophobic lipid bilayer but instead diffuses into the cell through the GLUT4 protein.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) Identify the component in the schematic that causes feedback inhibition of insulin signaling. p70S6k
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d) The Insulin growth factor (IGF-1) promotes cell proliferation as shown below. 
 
 
  
IGF-1 activates a signaling cascade that finally activates Cyclin D1 gene expression. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
•  The Cyclin D1 protein binds to and activates Cyclin dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Active Cdk4 allows the cell to move to the next phase of the cell cycle. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Activated Cdk4 also degrades Cyclin D1.

i.	  On the schematic, circle the protein of IGF-1 signaling that is expressed during ALL the phases 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of cell cycle. Cdk4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.	  Using a temperature sensitive mutant of Cdk4, you find that the cells fail to divide at the non-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
permissive temperature and each arrested cell has a diploid DNA content (2n) in its nucleus. At
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
what cell cycle checkpoint (choose from G1/ S, S/G2 or G2/ M) is the Cdk4 protein likely to act?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The cell will arrest in G1/ S checkpoint since the cell still has the diploid (2n) DNA content.

Question 1 continued
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You identify the following Cdk4 mutants. 
iii.	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Mutant A shows deletion of the kinase domain of Cdk4. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Mutant B shows no degradation of Cyclin D1 by Cdk4. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Relative to the wild-type cells, which of these mutants (choose from mutant A or B) will show no cell 
 
 
 
proliferation? Explain why you selected this option over the other.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mutant A will show no cell proliferation since in the absence of its kinase domain Cdk4 will not phosphorylate its
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
target protein and the cell will remain arrested in G1/ S phase. In comparison, since cyclin D1 in mutant 2 is not
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
degraded it will constitutively activate Cdk4. Hence the cell will show uncontrolled cell proliferation. 
 
Question 2 (20 points)
  
 
Much research focuses on understanding how the pancreatic  β cells form during embryogenesis in the 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hopes of regenerating these in the diabetic patients.  
 
 
a) The pancreas endocrine cells, including the  β cells, are formed from the anterior endoderm (AE).
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You isolate AE from embryos on days 5, 6 and 7 after fertilization and culture these explants in vitro (in 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cell culture plates) until each is 10 days old. Since insulin expression indicates differentiated pancreatic  β 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cells, you measure the expression of insulin in each explant at the time of isolation and when they are
 
 
 
 
 
10 days old. You tabulate the results below.

i.	  At the time of isolation, are the Day 6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
explants committed, differentiated,
 
 
uncommitted compared to Day 7 
 
 
 
 
 
explants? Explain why you selected 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this option.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
They are committed since after 4 days of culture
 
 
 
 
 
they differentiate into insulin secreting
 
 
 
pancreatic β cells. 
 
 
ii.	  Circle the option that best categorizes the insulin gene (choose from ubiquitous, restricted, effector 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gene). Explain why you selected this option.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is an effector gene since it is expressed only in the functional β cells of the pancreas. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) You want to study the interaction of endoderm cells with another group of cells called notochord.
 
You isolate the 5 days old anterior (head) endoderm (AE) and posterior (tail) endoderm (PE) from the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
embryo and culture them either alone or in combination with anterior notochord (AN) or posterior
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
notochord (PN) until the cells are 10 days old. You measure the insulin expression in each culture to see
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
if they have differentiated into pancreatic β cells.  Your results are tabulated below. Note: The AE, PE, 
 
 
 
 
 
AN and PN were 5 days old at the time of isolation and did not express insulin.

Based on the data provided, explain the

Yes 
 
 
   
role of AN in the formation of pancreatic 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No 
PE + PN 
 
 
 
β cells. 
 
 
   
 
AN most likely, secretes an inducer (or a signaling factor), which binds to a specific receptor located on the cells of
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AE so that they become pancreatic β cells.  Note: NO need to say anything about the other tissues. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the data provided, what is the role of the endoderm (AE, PE) in restricting the
 
 
 
ii.	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
formation of the pancreatic β cells to the anterior of the embryo?

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The AE and PE can both respond to the AN, but the PE does not do so because it is far way from the AN. So the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
endoderm really PLAYS NO ROLE in restricting where the b cells form.

Question 2 continued
 
 
 
The notochord secretes fibroblast growth factor (FGF), which triggers a signaling cascade that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iii. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
activates the transcription factor Sox2.  This promotes the formation of pancreatic β cells. Based 
 
  
 
on these data… 
•  Would you classify FGF as an inducer or determinant? Explain your choice. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
FGF being secretory is an inducer and not a determinant. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Where would the receptors for FGF reside (choose any from AN, PN, AE or PE)? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Where would the Sox2 gene be expressed (choose any from AN, PN, AE or PE)? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Where would the Sox2 gene be inactive (choose any from AN, PN, AE or PE)? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 3 (20 points)
 
 
The following schematic represents the major steps of pancreatic organogenesis. Note: The transcription 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
factors (TFs) i.e. Hlx1, Ipf1, Pdx-1, p48 required at different steps are shown.

a) Circle the option that best describes the potency of the cells of specified pancreatic bud that form the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pancreas (choose from multipotent, unipotent, totipotent)? Explain why you selected this option. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is multi- potent since it forms cells of multiple fates. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) What would be the effect of loss-of- function mutation of Sox2 on pancreatic organogenesis?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
In the absence of a functional Sox2, cell of the AE will not form the pancreatic bud and hence there will be NO
 
pancreatic organogenesis. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) The TF, p48 is expressed in early organogenesis and also later in the exocrine cells. However its
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
expression is inhibited in the endocrine cells. A null mutant (complete knock out) of Ipf1 leads to 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
expression of p48 in the endocrine cells, which no longer go on to become pancreatic β cells. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.  What is the role of Ipf1 in regulating p48 expression? Ipf-1 inhibits p48 expression. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.  What is the role of p48 in regulating pancreatic β cell formation? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
P48 inhibits the differentiation of endocrine- exocrine precursor cells into endocrine pancreatic β cell. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d) You identify a mutant where the cells fail to form epithelial sheets. Circle the correct characteristics 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the cells from below that could produce the mutant phenotype. The cells in this mutant … 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Show mesenchymal to epithelial transition (True or false) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Lack homotypic cell- cell junctions (True or false)

Question 3 continued
 
e) Researchers have shown that forcing the expression of three transcription factors (Ngn3, Pdx1 and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mafa) can reprogram the exocrine cells of the pancreas in adult mice into insulin expressing pancreatic 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
β cells. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You want to use the fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) to get a pure exocrine cell
i.	 
 
population for reprogramming. Circle the fluorescence tagged antibody that you would use for 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
purification of these cells and explain why you selected this option. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
•	  Antibody specific to the Pdx1 transcription factor 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Antibody specific to cell surface protein X.
 
Since you need the live purified exocrine cell population for reprograming you would use the antibody that 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
specifically binds to the cell membrane protein and does not disrupt the integrity of the cell. The antibody specific
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to Pdx1 has to enter the inside of the cell to bind to Pdx1  and can do so only if the cells are permeabilized. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You successfully reprogram the exocrine cells into pancreatic β cells that secrete insulin and 
ii.	 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have wild-type morphology. You introduce these cells into two diabetic mice (mouse A &B). 
 
•	  Circle the cell surface molecule that you would test to avoid the chances of immunological 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rejection of the introduced pancreatic β cells. 
 
           
          
      
 
            
       
  
 
IgG

CD4 
MHCI 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•	  You find that the introduced pancreatic β cells reduce the symptoms of diabetes in Mouse A but
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
not in Mouse B. Assuming there is no immunological rejection in either of the mice, which cells
 
 
 
 
 
(choose from original pancreatic β cells or cells in the surrounding niche) in mouse B have the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mutation. Provide a brief explanation. 
 
 
 
 
The mutation in mouse B is in the cells of the surrounding Niche. In the absence of the signals from the
 
 
 
 
surrounding niche the introduced pancreatic β cells fail to function. 
 
Question 4 (22 points)
 
Vaccination is a very effective way of providing protection against pathogens. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a) You develop a heterologous vaccine that can provide immunity against a form of Flu virus.  You 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vaccinate two healthy individuals with this vaccine. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.	  Would the B cells with surface-bound antibodies specific to this form of flu virus in Individual 1
 
be the same as that in Individual 2? Explain why or why not.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
No, since each individual undergoes a random arrangement of the antibody gene to produce B cells, each of which 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
has a unique VDJ combination and is therefore producing a unique antibody that is specific to a unique antigen. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.	  From the choices below circle the type(s) of immune responses that will be generated by this
 
 
 
vaccine.
 
 
  
      
  
        
 
  
 
Innate	 
Cytotoxic 
Humoral 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
What property of the virus used as a heterologous vaccine…… 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Prevents it from causing any severe symptoms in the recepient unlike the flu virus?
 
•	 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
This is a weak virus  and therefore causes either no or only mild symptoms compared to the flu virus. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Allows it to provide protection against the flu virus?
 
• 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
The virus used  as a heterologous vaccine has surface antigen common to the flu virus antigens. So the memory
 
 
 
 
 
 
cells that are specific to the common antigens and are generated in an individual after receiving the hetterologous
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vaccine will provide rapid and strong protection to the vaccinated individual against the flu virus.

Question 4 continued
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) Five years after being vaccinated with the heterologous vaccine, both Individuals encounter a new
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
form of flu virus. You assay their humoral immune response specific to the new form of flu virus and
 
 
  
 
obtain the following profile. 

 

 

Explain why the immune response of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Individual 1 to the new variant of flu virus 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
differs from that of Individual 2. 

 
 
Unlike individual 2, individual 1 has had previous exposure to another virus/ pathogen that has surface antigens 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
common to the new form of flu virus. So  memory T and memory B cells that this individual already has, start
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
proliferating to give rise to rapid and stronger secondary immune response. 
 
c) You compare the antibody gene of a B cell (B cell X) that produces a membrane bound antibody that 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
specifically binds to the flu virus with the antibody gene of the memory B cells and plasma cells 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
descending from B cell X. 
 
 
i.	  Would the antibody gene be the same or different between the B cell X and the plasma cells?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Explain why you selected this option. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It would be the same since the B cell X and descending plasma cells are recognizing the same antigen. However,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
you may argue that the antibody gene in the plasma cells may have undergone somatic hypermutations to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
produce an antibody that has a higher affinity for the antigen compared to the surface antibody of the B cell X. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hence there may be slight variations. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.	  Would the mature mRNA transcript be the same or different between the B cell X and the plasma 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cells? Explain why you selected this option.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is different due to alternative splicing thus producing a cell surface bound IgM and secretory IgG antibodies. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iii. 	  Circle the cell type(s) (choose from B cell X, memory B cells and plasma cells) that will produce 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
antibodies that can bind to and eliminate the virus. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iv.	  Circle the cell type(s) (choose from B cell X, memory B cells and plasma cells) that is terminally
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
differentiated.
 
 
d) You are working with a retrovirus that can integrate into the host genome and is not expressed.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Briefly explain why a cell infected with this virus is not detected by the immune system. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the virus is integrated, the viral proteins are not expressed and hence will not be presented on the surface of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
infected cells through MHC-I molecules and will therefore not be recognized by TC  cells. Hence the virus- infected 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cells remains unrecognized by the immune system and does not undergo TC  cells mediated killing. 
 
Question 5 (18 points)
 
 
 
a) The voltage gated (VG) Na+  channel is comprised of two polypeptide chains and its activation results 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the action potential. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.	  What is the highest order of protein structure (choose from primary, secondary, tertiary or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
quaternary) in a voltage gated Na+  channel?

b) AcotininE is a neurotoxin that specifically binds to the open / active conformation of VG Na+ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
channel and causes its persistent activation via allosteric modulation. Eventually the channels close 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and later reset so they are ready to depolarize. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.	  Would AcotininE mediate its effect by binding in the pore of the VG Na+  channel through
 
 
which Na+  ions can pass (Yes/ No)? Explain.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No, allosteric modulator by definition binds to a site different from the substrate binding sites of the proteins or
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enzymes and thereby change their conformation. So AcotininE will bind to a different site instead of binding
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inside the pore of the VG Na+  channel through which Na+  ions can pass. Alternatively, occluding the pore would 
 
  
 
prevent Na+ ion passage. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You stimulate a neuron with an excitatory neurotransmitter and measure the frequency of the
ii.	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
resulting action potential. You next stimulate a similar neuron with the same neurotransmitter
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
together with AcotininE. You observe that adding AcotininE reduces the frequency of the action 
 
 
 
potential. Explain why is this so.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The frequency of the resulting action potential is reduced in the presence of AcotininE since it takes longer for the
 
 
VG Na+ channels to close and reset. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) Serotonin (5-HT) can serve both as an excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitter based on the type of
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
receptors to which it binds. The 5-HT3 receptors act as ligand gated Na+  channels. In comparison, the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5-HT2 receptors are ligand- gated Cl- channels that are coupled to G proteins. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.	  Upon binding of serotonin to the 5-HT3 and 5-HT2 receptors would… 
 
 
* Na+  ions flow into or out of the cell? Into 
* Cl- ions flow into or out of the cell? Into 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In response to serotonin, would you expect both 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors to activate ion flow
ii.	 
 
 
with the same time course? Explain. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No. In response to serotonin, since the 5-HT2 receptors being metabotropic will first have to activate G proteins
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
before the associated Cl- channel can be opened. This takes more time than directly opening the 5-HT3 receptors,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which are ionotropic and themselves function as ligand ligated Na+  channels. 
 
You are studying a neuron that expresses functional 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors and secretes
iii.	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
glycine in the synaptic cleft when stimulated. You stimulate this neuron with serotonin in the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
presence of latrotoxin, which induces a large Ca++ influx specifically through VG Ca++ channels 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
located at the axon terminus of the neuron. Would this treatment have an effect on the… 
 
•  Amplitude of action potentials elicited by this neuron (Yes/ No)? Explain your choice. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No, the amplitude of action potential is always constant. 
 
•  Secretion of neurotransmitter by this neuron (Yes/ No)? Explain your choice. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Yes, since voltage gated Ca2+  channels located at the axon terminus are involved in exocytosis of endorphins into 
 
 
 
the synaptic cleft.

Explanation for Graph 1: Serotonin secreted by the pre- synaptic neuron will bind to its 5-HT3 receptors on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the post- synaptic neuron, which will open to allow Na+ ions to diffuse into the neuron thus depolarizing the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
membrane and resulting in an action potential. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Explanation for Graph 2:  Glycine secreted by the pre- synaptic neuron will bind to its receptors on the post-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
synaptic neuron, which will open to allow Cl- ions to move into the neuron thus hyperpolarizing the membrane
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and drifting the membrane potential even further away from threshold level.

The major steps of this pathway are given below: 
 
Insulin hormone binds to Insulin growth factor receptors (IGF receptor) and activates them through dimerization. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•	 
•	  Activated IGF receptors phosphorylate and activate insulin receptor substrate (IRS). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•	  Active IRS activates P13 kinase (PI3K), which phosphorylates and activates phosphoinositide- dependent kinase
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(PDK) through a series of steps. 
 
 
 
 
•	  Activated PDK phosphorylates and activates Akt. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•	  Activated Akt… 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ü Inhibits apoptosis by phosphorylating and inhibiting GSK3 and FOXO proteins. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ü Promotes protein synthesis by phosphorylating and activating P70S6k. These newly synthesized proteins promote cell 
 
 
proliferation. 
 
 
 
ü Phosphorylates and dissociates AS160 protein from GLUT4. The GLUT-4 then migrates to the cell membrane where
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
it serves as a pore for Glucose entry. 
•	  The activated p70S6K also binds to and inhibits IRS.
