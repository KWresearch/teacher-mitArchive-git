Solution Key- 7.013 Finals (5 / 19 / 09) 
Question 1 
Familial adenomatous po lyposis (FAP) affects nearly 1/8000 people in the USA. Pat ients having FAP 
are genetically predisposed to  colon cancer. Mutations in the APC gene have been ident ified as the 
probable cause  of FAP.  
 
(a) The fo llow ing diagram  represents the gel electrophoretic profiles of both the PCR amplified APC 
DNA (top panel) and APC protein (bottom  panel) isolated from  white blood cells (WBCs) and co lon 
cancer  cells of two individual patients. (A profile of  the APC DNA and APC protein in a normal individual is 
provided as a reference . Please note the intensity of the bands while answering this question).

Explain why in the norma l individua l, the  APC protein is detected only in colon cells 
i. 
 
even though the  APC DNA is present in both co lon ce lls and WBCs. 
 
All somatic cells in an individual have the same DNA and hence  the same set of genes. However, each cell 
 
type in an individual expresses only specific set of genes which regulate their shape, size and functions . 
 
 
 
ii.  One of these two  individuals does not have FAP but still develops colon cancer. Given 
Lower 
the data above , which individual would this be?  Explain how this individua l got  co lon 
MW 
cancer . 
Individual #2 does not have FAP but sporadically develops colon cancer . This individual undergoes a 
spontaneous  somatic mutation of both  alleles of APC genes in colon cells producing a non-functional APC 
protein that leads to colon cancer . 
 
iii.  Complete the fo llow ing table based on the  information provided in the gel profile above. 
(Use the symbols ‘+’ to represent the wild-type allele of  the APC gene , ‘-‘ to represent the loss of  
function mutation and  ‘M’ to represent the  gain of function mutation. The  genotype  of the  APC 
gene in a normal individual is provided as  a reference).

Question 1 continued 
 (b) Vincristine is an inhibitor  of microtubule assembly and is used as an important chemotherapeut ic 
drug. Explain how the disruption of microtubule assembly may prevent  cancer cell growth. 
 
Microtubules are  required for the  formation of spindle fibers during cell division that are required to pull the 
sister chromatids towards the two poles. If these are disrupted the sister chromatids fail to separate  properly thus 
inhbiting cell division and  making  the cell non-viable. Thus  the growth of tumor  will be inhibited. 
 
 
(c) During drug screening you identify two compounds A and B that  have  the  potential to kill co lon 
cancer  cells and normal cells as shown by the fo llowing graph.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Compound concentra tion  
 
Which of these two compounds is a better candida te for colon cancer  treatment? Explain why. 
 
Compound A will be  a better choice since it has a larger therapeutic index  i.e. The effective concentration of  
compound A that is required to kill the cancer cells is far less compared to the concentration needed to kill the 
normal cells. 
 
(d) Many pat ients show  signs of severe anemia  as a side  effect  of chemotherapy and are prescribed 
erythropoietin (EPO). EPO is a secreted protein, produced by the  kidney, which binds to its receptor  on 
erythro id precursor  cells and stimulates the forma tion of red blood cells (RBCs). Four different 
mutations are described be low. For  each mutation, list whether the RBC production would increase , 
decrease  or not change  in an individua l that was homozygous for this mutation as compared to  the  
wild-type  situation. Briefly explain your reasoning for  each mutation.

i.  A mutation in the EPO gene , which results in deletion of the signal sequence  of the  EPO 
protein. 
EPO will not be secreted by the kidney  cells. RBC production will decrease. 
 
ii.  A mutation in the EPO receptor , which results in the delet ion of its transmembrane 
doma in. 
EPO receptors will not be expressed on the surface of erythroid precursor cells and  will therefore not available 
to bind  to the EPO secreted by  kidney. RBC production will decrease. 
 
iii.  A mutation in the EPO receptor  that results in the deletion of its cytoplasmic domain.  
EPO receptor will bind  to the EPO. However in the absence of the cytoplasmic domain the signal will not  be 
propagated to the other  component in the erythroid precursor cells that are required to promote cell 
proliferation. RBC production will decrease. 
 
iv.  A mutation that results in a  constitutively act ive promoter for  the  EPO gene . 
EPO will be always be produced and available to bind to the EPO receptors on erythroid precursor cells to 
increase RBC production. 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 

Question 2 
You are studying two characteristics in a  plant; growth (slow or  fast) and seed size  (small or large). You 
cross a true-breeding plant w ith large seeds and slow growth to a true-breeding plant with small seeds 
and fast growth. All of the result ing F1 plants have sma ll seeds and grow  slowly.  
 
(a) What  are the genotypes of the  true breeding parental plants? Use the  nomenclature outlined below. 
In each case , use  the uppercase letter for  the allele associated with the dominant phenotype and the  
• 
lowercase letter for  the allele associated with  the recessive phenotype. 
•  For the  seed size (i.e. large or  small) use D or d to designate the alleles. 
•  For the  growth (i.e. slow or  fast) use G or g  to designate the alleles.

Question 4 
Her-2  is a gene that encodes a glycoprotein that is a member  of the family of Epidermal growth factor 
(EGF) receptor tyrosine kinases. Her-2 gene amplification is observed in 30% of breast cancers.  
 
(a) In a  breast cancer patient that over-expresses Her-2  gene, would you characterize the gene  
encoding Her-2  prote in as an oncogene, tumor suppressor  gene or  a proto-oncogene? Expla in. 
 
It is an oncogene since  gene amplification is also a gain of function . 
 
 (b) From the cho ices given below, circle the molecule(s) that may be present in Her-2  receptor 
glycoprote in.

(c) Breast cancer  patients that show  the  amplification of the  Her-2  gene can be effective ly treated with 
Herceptin, a monoclonal antibody that  specifically binds to and prevents the dimerization of Her-2 
receptors. 
Based on your  knowledge of immuno logy, each  Herceptin antibody molecule can 
i. 
potentia lly bind to  how many Her-2  receptor molecules?  
It has  two antigen binding sites per molecule. 
ii.      The heavy and the  light chains of the  Herceptin antibody should join together  to form  an 
intact  functiona l antibody. Name  the  strongest type of interaction/bond that holds the 
chains together to  form an antibody.

(f) You come across the  following mutations of Glu558 in the  Her-2 gene .  For  each mutation, expla in 
whether the binding of Herceptin with Her-2 protein will be  disrupted. (Note: A table of 20 essential 
amino acids and a codon chart is provided on the last two pages of this exam).

This mutat ion creates  an  early stop codon and hence  the

Her-2 receptor protein w ill be shorter  and  most likely  non-
 
functional. A lso Glu558 is  needed for herceptin-Her-2 
binding and absence  disrupts the bind ing. 
This is  a silent mutation that  causes no change in  the 
amino ac id sequence . 
The G lu558 is changed to Asp that  is also negatively 
charged like.  But if someone argues  that this  change  may 
cause steric hindrance then that is worth full credit. 
 
(g) Be low are  three different  options for a hypothetical linear stretch of amino acids present in the  
Her-2  receptor.  For each option, the amino  acids in Region 1 could represent a part of the

i.  Which option(s) most  likely includes a stretch of Her-2  receptor that spans the  lipid 
bilayer? Explain in one  sentence  why you selected this option.  
Options 1 and 2 contain a stretch of amino acids stretch that comprises a part of the transmembrane domain

Question 5 
Consider the following signal transduct ion pathway that  is act ivated by the binding of EGF ligand to 
its specific membrane receptor . 
•  EGF ligand  binds to the EGF receptor . 
•  Ligand bound EGF receptors become active through phosphorylation and  dimerization. 
•  Active EGF receptor causes Ras  to exchange its bound GDP for  GTP and become active. 
•  Active Ras activates the kinase cascade (RAF, MEK and MAPK) through phosphorylation. 
•  This increases the expression of c-myc gene which  promotes cell proliferation.

•  Mutant 1 (m1): Ras protein that continues to stay  in its GDP bound form. 
•  Mutant 2 (m2): RAF protein that lacks its kinase domain. 
•  Mutant 3 (m3): EGF receptor that lacks its  extracellular domain. 
•  Mutant 4 (m4): MAPK that is  constitutively phosphorylated at its active site.

No proliferation . Both Ras and Raf kinases are constitutively inactive and so 
the cascade  is never turned on to enhance c-myc gene  expression  that promotes cell 
proliferat ion . 
Increased proliferation. c-myc w ill be constitutively expressed  owing to  its 
constitutively active promoter  irrespective  of the  presence or  absence  of active  
MAPK in nucleus.  
Increased proliferation. c-myc will be constitutively expressed owing to  its 
constitutively active promoter . This will not require upstream signaling  that is 
init iated  by the bind ing of EGF  w ith its  receptor.

Hydrogen bonds. 
 
In Region 1, if the sequence of the  top region is AUGGCUAA, can you predict  the  %  of 
bases i.e . %A, %U %C and %G of the bottom region? Explain. (Note : Your  choices are  Yes/

Question 7 
Oncogenic mutations can result from  DNA rearrangements or  duplications. Below  is a  partia l sequence 
of two different genes.  Gene 1  encodes a  prote in that is always expressed at  high levels.  Gene  2 
encodes a growth st imulating protein that is only expressed when the cell has received growth 
promoting signals. On occasion, Gene  2 gets positioned near the promoter  for  Gene  1.  Some  of these 
DNA rearrangements allow an increase in expression of the growth-promoting Gene 2.  This can result 
in uncontrolled ce ll division. The direction of transcription is shown by an arrow. 
 
Gene 1: expressed at  high leve ls. A Partial sequence of gene  1 is shown below.  The ita licized and

Question 8 
 In nature , the influenza A virus has persisted in wild aquatic birds for millions of years and does not 
typically produce harmful effects. This is a  single (-) stranded, segmented, RNA virus that does not 
replicate via a  DNA intermediate.  Its genome  is comprised of 8 distinct  RNA strands that together 
encode 10  different  proteins. The  following is a schematic of the  influenza virus.

(a) Influenza virus is unable to  make more vira l RNA genome w ithin the  host cells using exclusively 
the host  cell proteins.  
i. 
Explain why that  is so . 
 
This being  a negative(-) stranded RNA virus can not be converted by the host  cell machinery to a 
positive (+) RNA that  has the  same  polarity as mRNA and is needed for translation. 
 
ii. 
Explain how the virus overcomes this issue  and replicates its genome in the  host.  
It solves this problem by  bringing along its own RNA dependant RNA polymerase enzyme at the time of 
infection. Also RNA is less stable than DNA due  to the  presence of  extra –OH group at 2’C position of ribose 
sugar. 
 
(b) Explain why the influenza A virus can rapidly mutate to  produce  new variants.  
The RNA dependant RNA polymerase has no proofreading activity thus  increasing the frequency of 
mutation that leads to the production of new strains. 
 
(c) You decide to generate vaccine  against Influenza A virus using e ither  a live-attenuated form of the 
virus or heat–killed viral part icles.  
 
i.  Which of these two vaccine strategies produces both antibody and Tc mediated  immune  
responses? Explain why. 
Live-attenuated  form of virus will produce  both  the responses. The virus  is still replicating although at  a very 
slow pace  and  hence the  viral proteins can presented on the surface of infected cells through MHC1 
leading  to a Tc mediated cell killing or through MHC-II by Antigen presenting  cells leading to a TH and B 
cell mediated humoral immune response. 
 

If the vaccine generated against  the  virus leads to a cell mediated immune  response, 
name the proteins/enzymes (secreted by the cytotoxic T cells) that cause the killing of 
virus infected cells and propose  a mechanism  through which they do  so . 
Perforins that kill the  virus infected cells by  creating holes and making  it leaky. 
Granzymes that promote apoptosis of  virus infected cells 
 

If the vaccine generated results only in a  humora l response  and production of 
antibodies…. 
Identify the  most  likely components of the virus, from the diagram  provided at the 
• 
beginning of this question, to which the  raised antibodies will bind. 
Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) since these are exposed at the viral surface . 
 
 
 

iii. 

ii. 

 

 

 

12 

Question 8 continued 
•  Propose a  mechanism through which the  secreted antibodies can counteract the 
vira l infection. 
The secreted antibodies can bind  to antigens located at the viral surface . Thus  the virus gets coated by the 
antibodies and in this form it can be engulfed and digested by macrophage . This process is also called 
opsonization. 
 
 
(d) If an individua l is exposed a  second t ime  to same stra in of Influenza  A virus, the secondary immune  
response  observed is much faster and stronger  than the primary response. Propose  an explanation for 
an increase in the  rate and strength of the  secondary immune response . 
 
The individual  already has  the memory TH and memory B cells that were produced during  the primary 
exposure. These cells can proliferate to produce more memory cells and the plasma cells that produce and secrete 
antibodies which lead to humoral immune response.  
 
(e) Pigs can be infected both by the avian and human forms of the Influenza  virus. This allows them to 
act as virus mixing bow ls in which the  two viral strains can readily exchange RNA strands. Thus the  
virus that  emerges from  such double-infected species can represent  a unique assortment  of genes, 
generating new strains of virus. The  HIN1  virus that causes Sw ine  flu is one  such example . Why is a 
newly emerged virus considered a threat that  is significant enough to  cause a  global pandemic, 
compared to a  seasonal viral strain? 
Newly emerged virus may have surface antigens  which have never been encountered by the 
immune system of the human population. This may therefore cause a global pandemic. 
 
(f) You come across a patient who is suffering from a mysterious illness that kills the  brain cells.  You 
grind the damaged brain ce lls and treat them  separately in vitro  with DNAse, RNAse, proteases and 
UV. You use  the  treated samples to infect normal mice . You observe  that  all these samples, except the 
one treated with proteases, can cause the same illness in infected mice. Based on the data  provided, 
what is the most  likely cause  of this illness?  
This disease is caused by  an infectious protein particle that are often called prions.

Question 9 
You have  started up a company to  produce  a vaccine against  a part icular  DNA virus that causes 
disease in humans. To begin with, you want to  screen the vira l genes to ident ify those which encode 
proteins that can be  used as potential ant igens to create this vaccine.   
 
You intend to adopt the fo llow ing strategy to identify such genes: 
Isolate the  viral genome. 
• 
•  Digest the genome  using  a specific restriction enzyme . 
•  Clone the digested viral DNA fragments  into a specific cloning  vector to make  a genomic library. 
In bacterial cells, select a clone producing viral antigen from viral gene(s). 
• 
 
(a) Why would you make  a viral genomic library, rather than a cDNA library, to screen for  viral genes? 
 
The cDNA library is prepared from mature  mRNA (that have  no introns but only  exons) and is used to look for 
those genes that are specifically expressed in a cell. However, this is not required in the viruses since they have no 
introns. Their mRNA can be  directly translated into proteins or  polyproteins without any need for  splicing. A 
cDNA library made from a virus infected cell is a library of genes expressed in the  cell will include not only  viral 
genes but also cellular genes (and a lot more cellular  genes than viral ones) and would  therefore be useless in 
trying to make a viral DNA library. 
 
(b) Shown below  are the restrict ion sites for four  restriction enzymes.  Cutting sites are indicated  by a s lash 
(/). 
 
              Enzyme R

 3’-AGG/CCC-5’ 
 
Usually, fragments cut  with different restrict ion enzymes cannot be ligated together. However, DNA 
fragments cut w ith enzyme  X and enzyme Y can be ligated together. 
 
Based on the  sequences given above , write the 6-base pa ir sequence of the  double-
i.

fragment. Be sure  to indicate the 5’ and 3’ ends of each DNA strand.

(c) You w ill use one of the three plasmids shown in the schematic be low as the cloning vector to  make 
your  library. Assume that you would clone fragments of the viral DNA into the restriction site X. You

The plasmid needs a bacterial origin of replication so that it can replicate in bacteria (this feature is absent in 
plasmid #3). It also needs the Tetracyclin resistant gene that  has no recognition site for the restriction 
enzyme X (unlike that observed in plasmid #1). Therefore plasmid #2 is the  best option.  
 
(d) After you have  transformed E. coli ce lls with your library, you grow  them on media conta ining

Ampicillin containing  medium. 
 
(e) After various DNA based assays, you identify one co lony that conta ins a  gene which encodes a viral 
protein to use as the  basis of your vaccine.  You decide to express it  in the milk of transgenic cows in 
order  to produce it  in large  quantities. You need to fuse the viral gene  to a  cow-specific promoter so  it 
will be expressed in the cow cells. For  the  promoter you choose, under what  condition(s) and in wha t 
cell type(s) should the promoter  be  active? Explain. 
 
You would select a mammary gland specific which is active (expresses protein) in the mammary  gland 
constitutively, so that the  protein will be expressed in the cow’s milk and will always be produced.

Question 10 
An important set of neural connections is between motor neurons of the spinal cord and the ir target 
muscles in the limbs. Lateral neurons express the transcript ion factor  LIM-1 and the receptor  tyrosine 
kinase EPH-4, and innervate (grow  towards and create synapses with) dorsal limb  muscles. In contrast, 
medial neurons express the  transcript ion factor  ISL-1 , do  not  express EPH-4 , and innervate the ventral 
limb muscles.  Both dorsa l and ventral limb muscles express and secrete ephrin-4, the  ligand for  the  
EPH-4 receptor .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) In order to ask whether  LIM-1 and ISL-1 play a  role in axonal pathfinding, researchers introduced a   
LIM-1 expressing construct into  developing media l neurons. The resulting neurons expressed EPH-4  
and innervated dorsa l limb muscle  rather  than ventral. Converse ly, expressing ISL-1 in lateral neurons 
prevented LIM-1  and EPH-4 expression, and the result ing neurons innervated ventral muscle , rather 
than dorsal muscle. Diagram the regulatory relationships between EPH-4 , LIM-1 , ISL-1, and dorsal 
muscle innervation that you can derive from  these results.  In your  diagram, use an    →    to indicate 
that it  activates and a    ⊥    to indicate inhibition.  
 
There are two possibilities: 
 
     ISL     -  1                              L  I M    - 1                                      E   P  H   -  4                Or 
 
In either case, EPH-4 promotes dorsal muscle innervation. 
 
(b) Axon pathfinding takes place  in immature neurons. Once  axons find their  targets on the muscle , 
chemical synapses form to  create the neuromuscular junctions. In the  term  chemical synapse, to wha t

Question 10 continued 
In neuromuscular synapses, the axon is presynaptic and the muscle  is postsynaptic. Neuromuscular  
synapses are  often excitatory, and the  output  is muscle contract ion. The  neurotransmitter is 
acetylcholine  (Ach), and binds to  nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AchR), which are ligand-gated Na+ 
channels. Ach is destroyed by acetylcholinesterase (Ach-esterase) after  it is released into the synaptic 
cleft. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(c) In Myasthenia gravis, that targets the Ach receptor, muscles fail to contract, leading to profound 
weakness. Expla in one  type  of  change  in Ach receptor that could cause this disorder , and why. 
Any loss of function (i.e. blocking  Ach receptor binding site, conformation change  etc) in the gene encoding  for 
the Ach  receptor  can cause this disorder by  preventing muscle from receiving the  signal (from pre-synaptic 
neuron) so that it can contract.  
(d) Lambert-Eaton syndrome is associated with the production of antibodies to pre-synaptic voltage-
gated calcium  channels. Explain why such ant ibodies cause  a decrease in muscle contraction in affected 
individuals re lative to  normal individuals. 
The antibodies will prevent calcium influx through voltage gated calcium channels that will cause the failure of 
vesicles to fuse with the plasma membrane and release the Ach in the synaptic cleft  leading to decreased 
or no muscle contraction.  
 
(e) Botulism  is an illness caused by Botulinum toxin, produced by the bacterium Clostridium  
botulinum . The toxin inactivates synaptobrevin, a membrane protein of synaptic vesicles, required for 
exocytosis. Would the  frequency of muscle  contraction increase or decrease  in patients w ith Botulism 
relative  to unaffected individuals? Explain. 
The muscle contraction will decrease since exocytosis of vesicles is required for the release of Ach in 
the synaptic cleft  which  binds to its  specific Ach receptors located on muscles to trigger muscle contraction 
(f) Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is a major cause of senile dementia, similar  to Alzheimers. The 
disorder can be  treated with Acetylcholinesterase , and Ach receptors are normal in these patients. 
What  is the most like ly cause of DLB? 
It is either an increased release of Ach by the presynaptic neurons or a defective acetylcholinesterase 
enzyme that fails to digest  the Ach that has been released in the synaptic cleft.

Question 11 
The liver is an organ which consists of lobules, each containing three major  cell types in characterist ic 
organization. The most  prevalent type  of cells are  hepatocytes, which filter  the blood, endothelial cells 
which line the sinusoids, vesse ls that carry blood between groups of hepatocytes, and a few Kupfer  
cells which a lso line the sinusoids.  

Endothelial cells 
Kupffer cells 
Hepatocytes 

Sinusoids 

Taken from Adams  and Eksteen Nature 2006 

 
 
HepaHope  is a bioengineering company that  is testing a “hybrid” liver . This consists of a suspension of 
single  hepatocytes on a  synthetic support . It works like a  kidney dialysis machine , filtering the patient’s 
blood to  remove ammonia  and detoxify wastes. One issue with this device  is that the  hepatocytes 
constantly need replenishing, as they stop funct ioning about 24 hours after being added to the device. 
 
 
(a) In general what  structural aspect of the  normal liver  is missing from  the  HepaHope device? 
The complex 3D-conformation and the surrounding niche is missing. 
 
(b) You consult  with the company and suggest tha t hepatocyte  function may be prolonged by addition 
of signaling mo lecules. You decide  to test ligands from four  major signa ling pathways to see if they 
prolong liver  cell function. These ligands are Fgf3, Delta , Wnt8  and BMP4. Factors are  tested in 
combination, w ith the  encouraging results be low.

i.  Which ligand(s) is most important in pro longing the liver function? What  next factor 
combination(s) would you assay to  test the ligands that  you identified? 

 
Wnt  8 appears to be essential either alone or in combination with Fgf. One  may assay  wnt8  alone, compred with 
wnt8+Fgf, to determine whether Fgf is required. 
 

 

 

ii. 

If any of these  ligands normally regulate liver function (that is, in the intact  liver), where  
would you expect to  observe  expression of …. (Your choices are hepatocytes, endothelial 
cells, kupfer cells and  sinusoids). 
 
 
 

19 

 

Question 11 continued 
•  These  ligands? Endothelial cells, Kupfur cells or  Sinusoids (any answer is fine based on 
the provided information). 
 
•  The receptors for  these ligands?  Hepatocytes 
 
(c) Hepatocytes have a  ha lf-life (time  of survival) of about 10 days. BrdU is a  thymine  ana log that  is 
incorporated normally into  DNA, but is used in a  pulse/chase assay to dist inguish DNA synthesized 
during the  pulse. Describe  a pulse/chase  experiment w ith BrdU that  would measure hepatocyte  half-
life.  
 
BrdU incorpration over time to assay for hepatocytes cell death. 
 
(d) Damaged liver  can regenerate  well, suggesting the invo lvement of liver  stem ce lls. Some evidence 
suggests that that Kupfer cells are  liver  stem  cells. How  would you test  whether  Kupfer ce lls are stem 
cells, using a  transplant  approach? Note:  Carbon te trachloride treatment can be  used to specifically destroy 
the liver. 
 
Destroy the  liver cells of a mouse using carbon tetrachloride.  Transplant Kupfer cells from a healthy liver into the 
mouse .  If the Kupfer cells are stem cells, liver will be able to regenerate  and mouse  will be OK. 
 
(e) The sinusoids are tubes that arise from single cells that associate to  form  a sheet  which eventua lly 
forms a tube. What  is the term  for  conversion of single  ce lls to cell sheets? 
 
Mesenchymal to epithelial transition. 
 
 (f) What  changes will the fo llow ing perturbations have on single ce lls versus cell sheets? Your op tions

Explanation 
ECM has ligands that may  be  involved in  triggering the  
signaling pathways  that regulate shape and movement of 
mesenchymal cells  or  adhesion of epithelial cells . 

These are  involved  in  holding the  epithelial cells  of the  
sheet together . 

Actin is a cytoskeletal protein that  exists in the form  of G  
monomers that can  polymerize  to form  F actin  polymer . 
his polymerizat ion  regu lates  shape  and movement  of cells. 
Homotypic cell-cell adhesion is  involved  allows the  
epithelial cells to adhere together and form a sheet . I f this  
is d isrupted the  epithelial cell shhet falls  apart and most 
likely  these cells undergo a transit ion  to mesenchymal 
cells. 
Microtubu les are  required for  contraction and movement

Question 12 
(a) The liver arises from ventral embryonic endoderm. Using some  or a ll of the frog embryos below , 
how would you use the technique  of fate mapping to address from where  in the embryo the liver 
arises? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   Early embryo (4 hours old)             
 
 
 
Inject a non-diffusible dye into the cells located in different cells 
of early embryo and see if the liver cells in the 40  hrs embryo 
retain that dye. 
  
 
 
 
(b) Hepatocytes are  differentiated liver ce lls. HNF4a is a  hepatocyte -specific transcription factor  
necessary for activation of  all liver  differentiation genes, including albumin. In order to  understand 
the mechanism  by which HNF4a  acts, you express HNF4a in the developing pancreas, which is also 
derived from  endoderm . In this case, expression of albumin and other liver-specific genes is not 
activated. Explain this observation. 
 
 HNF-4  is functional  only  in the  cells that are  committed to become liver cells. It does not activate albumin in 
pancreatic cells. It is also possible that the  developing pancreas  expresses a protein that acts as an inhibitor of 
HNF-4. 
 
(c) DNMT  is a DNA methylase , expressed throughout  development , which adds methyl groups to 
cytosine . You decide  to regenerate  animals by SCNT  using the  nuclei e ither  from adult hepatocytes, 40 
hour  embryonic hepatocytes, or  40 hour  hepatocytes treated w ith an inhibitor of the  DNA methlyase  
DNMT. Which of the three nuclei would be the best choice? Explain why you would prefer  one  over  
the other. 
 
 40 hour  hepatocytes treated with an inhibitor  of the DNA methlyase DNMT will be  the best choice. Since 
the methylation pattern are important for proper gene regulation and should  be as  close to the early 
embryonic state as possible for successful regeneration of animals by SCNT.
