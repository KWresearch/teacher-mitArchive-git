a) Give the most likely mode of inheritance of this disease.  
  
b) Give the genotype(s) of Individual 1 at Gene A locus based on her SNP1 & SNP2. Note: Use the letter 
“A” or XA to represent the allele associated with the dominant phenotype and ‘a” or Xa to represent the allele associated with 
the recessive phenotype. 
  
 
 
 
 
c) Give the alleles of SNP1 & SNP2 that are tightly linked with the allele of Gene A in Individual 2.

d) If Individual #3 is a male, what is the probability that he will be affected?   
 
e) The above disease is also observed in mice. You mate an affected female with an affected male to get 
a fertilized ovum. You then successfully introduce a wild- type allele of Gene A into the fertilized ovum 
and implant it into a pseudo-pregnant female mouse. You observe that it develops into a newborn 
male. 
 
i.  What would be the genotype of all somatic cell-types in this newborn?  
 
ii.  Will the introduced gene be passed on to the subsequent generations by the transgenic mouse 
(choose from yes, no or may be)? Explain. 

 
 
f) Why are two SNPs flanking a Gene regarded as better markers to predict its mode of inheritance 
compared to only one SNP located at one end of the Gene?
