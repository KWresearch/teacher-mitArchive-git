Question 1 (20 points)
 
 
Diabetes occurs either due to a reduced insulin hormone production by the pancreatic β cells or the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
resistance of target cells to insulin. As shown by the schematic on Page 9, insulin signaling mediates 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
glucose uptake, protein synthesis, cell survival and proliferation. Note: You can detach Page 9. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
a) Consider the following mutations in different components of insulin signaling. 
 
 
 
1. The kinase p70S6k  cannot bind to IRS. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  PI3 kinase (PI3K) cannot activate PDK.
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. The promoter region of Akt gene has methylated cytosines (MeC). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Complete the table for each of the above mutations relative to the wild-type cells in the presence of

why is this so. 
 
 
 
c) Identify the component in the schematic that causes feedback inhibition of insulin signaling. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d) The Insulin growth factor (IGF-1) promotes cell proliferation as shown below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IGF-1 activates a signaling cascade that finally activates Cyclin D1 gene expression. 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
•  The Cyclin D1 protein binds to and activates Cyclin dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Active Cdk4 allows the cell to move to the next phase of the cell cycle. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Activated Cdk4 also degrades Cyclin D1.

You identify the following Cdk4 mutants.

•  Mutant A shows deletion of the kinase domain of Cdk4.

Question 2 (20 points)
 
Much research focuses on understanding how the pancreatic  β cells form during embryogenesis in the 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
hopes of regenerating these in the diabetic patients.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The pancreas endocrine cells, including the  β cells, are formed from the anterior endoderm (AE).  You
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
isolate AE from embryos on days 5, 6 and 7 after fertilization and culture these explants in vitro (in cell 
 
 
 
  
 
 
culture plates) until each is 10 days old. Since insulin expression indicates differentiated pancreatic  β 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cells, you measure the expression of insulin in each explant at the time of isolation and when they are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 days old. You tabulate the results below.

b) You want to study the interaction of endoderm cells with another group of cells called notochord.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You isolate the 5 days old anterior (head) endoderm (AE) and posterior (tail) endoderm (PE) from the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
embryo and culture them either alone or in combination with anterior notochord (AN) or posterior
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
notochord (PN) until the cells are 10 days old. You measure the insulin expression in each culture to see
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
if they have differentiated into pancreatic β cells.  Your results are tabulated below. Note: The AE, PE,

The notochord secretes fibroblast growth factor (FGF), which triggers a signaling cascade that

The major steps of this pathway are given below: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Insulin hormone binds to Insulin growth factor receptors (IGF receptor) and activates them through dimerization. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•	 
•	  Activated IGF receptors phosphorylate and activate insulin receptor substrate (IRS). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•	  Active IRS activates P13 kinase (PI3K), which phosphorylates and activates phosphoinositide- dependent kinase
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(PDK) through a series of steps. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•	  Activated PDK phosphorylates and activates Akt. 
 
  
 
•	  Activated Akt… 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ü Inhibits apoptosis by phosphorylating and inhibiting GSK3 and FOXO proteins. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ü Promotes protein synthesis by phosphorylating and activating P70S6k. These newly synthesized proteins promote cell 
 
 
proliferation. 
 
 
ü Phosphorylates and dissociates AS160 protein from GLUT4. The GLUT-4 then migrates to the cell membrane where
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
it serves as a pore for Glucose entry. 
 
 
 
•	  The activated p70S6K also binds to and inhibits IRS.
