Question 5 
Consider the following signal transduct ion pathway that  is act ivated by the binding of EGF ligand to 
its specific membrane receptor . 
•  EGF ligand  binds to the EGF receptor . 
•  Ligand bound EGF receptors become active through phosphorylation and  dimerization. 
•  Active EGF receptor causes Ras  to exchange its bound GDP for  GTP and become active. 
•  Active Ras activates the kinase cascade (RAF, MEK and MAPK) through phosphorylation.

Question 7 
Oncogenic mutations can result from  DNA rearrangements or  duplications. Below  is a  partia l sequence 
of two different genes.  Gene 1  encodes a  prote in that is always expressed at  high levels.  Gene  2 
encodes a growth st imulating protein that is only expressed when the cell has received growth 
promoting signals. On occasion, Gene  2 gets positioned near the promoter  for  Gene  1.  Some  of these 
DNA rearrangements allow an increase in expression of the growth-promoting Gene 2.  This can result 
in uncontrolled ce ll division. The direction of transcription is shown by an arrow.

Identify the  most  likely components of the virus, from the diagram  provided at the 
• 
beginning of this question, to which the  raised antibodies will bind. 
 
 
•  Propose a  mechanism through which the  secreted antibodies can counteract the 
vira l infection. 
 

 
 
 
 
(d) If an individua l is exposed a  second t ime  to same stra in of Influenza  A virus, the secondary immune  
response  observed is much faster and stronger  than the primary response. Propose  an explanation for 
an increase in the  rate and strength of the  secondary immune response . 
 
 
 
 
 
(e) Pigs can be infected both by the avian and human forms of the Influenza  virus. This allows them to 
act as virus mixing bow ls in which the  two viral strains can readily exchange RNA strands. Thus the  
virus that  emerges from  such double-infected species can represent  a unique assortment  of genes, 
generating new strains of virus. The  HIN1  virus that causes Sw ine  flu is one  such example . Why is a 
newly emerged virus considered a threat that  is significant enough to  cause a  global pandemic, 
compared to a  seasonal viral strain? 
 
 
 
 
(f) You come across a patient who is suffering from a mysterious illness that kills the  brain cells.  You 
grind the damaged brain ce lls and treat them  separately in vitro  with DNAse, RNAse, proteases and 
UV. You use  the  treated samples to infect normal mice . You observe  that  all these samples, except the 
one treated with proteases, can cause the same illness in infected mice. Based on the data  provided, 
what is the most  likely cause  of this illness?

Question 9 
You have  started up a company to  produce  a vaccine against  a part icular  DNA virus that causes 
disease in humans. To begin with, you want to  screen the vira l genes to ident ify those which encode 
proteins that can be  used as potential ant igens to create this vaccine.   
 
You intend to adopt the fo llow ing strategy to identify such genes: 
Isolate the  viral genome. 
• 
•  Digest the genome  using  a specific restriction enzyme . 
•  Clone the digested viral DNA fragments  into a specific cloning  vector to make  a genomic library. 
In bacterial cells, select a clone producing viral antigen from viral gene(s). 
• 
 
(a) Why would you make  a viral genomic library, rather than a cDNA library, to screen for  viral genes? 
 
 
 
 
(b) Shown below  are the restriction sites for four  restriction enzymes.  Cutting sites are indicated  by a s lash 
(/).

 3’-AGG/CCC-5’ 
3’-GG GC/CC-5’    3’-AG GC/CT-5’ 
 
Usually, fragments cut  with different restrict ion enzymes cannot be ligated together. However, DNA 
fragments cut w ith enzyme  X and enzyme Y can be ligated together. 
 
Based on the  sequences given above , write the 6-base pa ir sequence of the  double-
i. 
stranded DNA molecule  at the  site of ligation of an X-cut DNA fragment to  a Y-cut DNA 
fragment. Be sure  to indicate the 5’ and 3’ ends of each DNA strand. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.  Will the resulting sequence  be cut  by……………… circle ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ for each : 
•  Restriction enzyme X   
(Yes/No)

(c) You w ill use one of the three plasmids shown in the schematic be low as the cloning vector to  make

Tetracycline to select  for  the  bacterial cells that have been transformed. What addit iona l selective  media  
would you replica-plate these  colonies onto to  identify the clones that conta in viral DNA?  
 
 
(e) After various DNA based assays, you identify one co lony that conta ins a  gene which encodes a viral 
protein to use as the  basis of your vaccine.  You decide to express it  in the milk of transgenic cows in 
order  to produce it  in large  quantities. You need to fuse the viral gene  to a  cow-specific promoter so  it 
will be expressed in the cow cells. For  the  promoter you choose, under what  condition(s) and in wha t 
cell type(s) should the promoter  be  active? Explain.

vector  to be  ma intained in the cow, which vector  could you use?

Question 9 continued 
 (g) You introduce the recombinant vector into embryonic cow  cells in culture .  Before you start  
growing up transgenic cows, you decide to  check the sequence of the  transgene in the  ce lls to make 
sure  it is correct .  You will first  PCR amplify your gene  of interest, then sequence the  PCR product.  
You have  three  primers which anneal to your  DNA construct as diagrammed below:

Question 10 
An important set of neural connections is between motor neurons of the spinal cord and the ir target 
muscles in the limbs. Lateral neurons express the transcript ion factor  LIM-1 and the receptor  tyrosine 
kinase EPH-4, and innervate (grow  towards and create synapses with) dorsal limb  muscles. In contrast, 
medial neurons express the  transcript ion factor  ISL-1 , do  not  express EPH-4 , and innervate the ventral 
limb muscles.  Both dorsa l and ventral limb muscles express and secrete ephrin-4, the  ligand for  the  
EPH-4 receptor .

Question 10 continued 
 (a) In order  to ask whether LIM-1  and ISL-1  play a role in axonal pathfinding, researchers introduced a  
LIM-1 expressing construct into  developing media l neurons. The resulting neurons expressed EPH-4  
and innervated dorsa l limb muscle  rather  than ventral. Converse ly, expressing ISL-1 in lateral neurons 
prevented LIM-1  and EPH-4 expression, and the result ing neurons innervated ventral muscle , rather 
than dorsal muscle. Diagram the regulatory relationships between EPH-4 , LIM-1 , ISL-1, and dorsal 
muscle innervation that you can derive from  these results.  In your  diagram, use an    →    to indicate 
that it  activates and a    ⊥    to indicate inhibition.  
 
 
 
 
 
(b) Axon pathfinding takes place  in immature neurons. Once  axons find their  targets on the muscle , 
chemical synapses form to  create the neuromuscular junctions. In the  term  chemical synapse, to wha t 
class of molecules does “chemica l” refer? 
 
 
 
In neuromuscular synapses, the axon is presynaptic and the muscle  is postsynaptic. Neuromuscular  
synapses are  often excitatory, and the  output  is muscle contract ion. The  neurotransmitter is 
acetylcholine  (Ach), and binds to  nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AchR), which are ligand-gated Na+ 
channels. Ach is destroyed by acetylcholinesterase (Ach-esterase) after  it is released into the synaptic 
cleft. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(c) In Myasthenia gravis, that targets the Ach receptor, muscles fail to contract, leading to profound 
weakness. Expla in one  type  of  change  in Ach receptor that could cause this disorder , and why.

Question 10 continued 
 (d) Lambert-Eaton syndrome is associated with the production of ant ibodies to  pre-synaptic voltage-
gated calcium  channels. Explain why such ant ibodies cause  a decrease in muscle contraction in affected 
individuals re lative to  normal individuals. 
 
 

 
(e) Botulism  is an illness caused by Botulinum toxin, produced by the bacterium Clostridium  
botulinum . The toxin inactivates synaptobrevin, a membrane protein of synaptic vesicles, required for 
exocytosis. Would the  frequency of muscle  contraction increase or decrease  in patients w ith Botulism 
relative  to unaffected individuals? Explain. 
 
 
 
(f) Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is a major cause of senile dementia, similar  to Alzheimers. The 
disorder can be  treated with Acetylcholinesterase , and Ach receptors are normal in these patients. 
What  is the most like ly cause of DLB? 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 11 
The liver is an organ which consists of lobules, each containing three major  cell types in characterist ic 
organization. The most  prevalent type  of cells  are hepatocytes, which filter  the blood, endothelial cells 
which line the sinusoids, vesse ls that carry blood between groups of hepatocytes, and a few Kupfer  
cells which a lso line the sinusoids.

Question 11 continued 
HepaHope  is a bioengineering company that  is testing a “hybrid” liver . This consists of a suspension of 
single  hepatocytes on a  synthetic support . It works like a  kidney dialysis machine , filtering the patient’s 
blood to  remove ammonia  and detoxify wastes. One issue with this device  is that the  hepatocytes 
constantly need replenishing, as they stop funct ioning about 24 hours after being added to the device. 
 
 
(a) In general what  structural aspect of the  normal liver  is missing from  the  HepaHope device? 
 
 
(b) You consult  with the company and suggest tha t hepatocyte  function may be prolonged by addition 
of signaling mo lecules. You decide  to test ligands from four  major signa ling pathways to see if they 
prolong liver  cell function. These ligands are Fgf3, Delta , Wnt8  and BMP4. Factors are  tested in 
combination, w ith the  encouraging results be low.

i.  Which ligand(s) is most important in pro longing the liver function? What  next factor 
combination(s) would you assay to  test the ligands that  you identified? 

 

 

ii. 

If any of these  ligands normally regulate liver function (that is, in the intact  liver), where  
would you expect to  observe  expression of …. (Your choices are hepatocytes, endothelial 
cells, kupfer cells and  sinusoids). 
•  These  ligands? 
 
•  The receptors for  these ligands? 
 
(c) Hepatocytes have a  ha lf-life (time  of survival) of about 10 days. BrdU is a  thymine  ana log that  is 
incorporated normally into  DNA, but is used in a  pulse/chase assay to dist inguish DNA synthesized 
during the  pulse. Describe  a pulse/chase  experiment w ith BrdU that  would measure hepatocyte  half-
life.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(d) Damaged liver  can regenerate  well, suggesting the invo lvement of liver  stem ce lls. Some evidence 
suggests that that Kupfer cells are  liver  stem  cells. How  would you test  whether  Kupfer ce lls are stem 
cells, using a  transplant  approach? Note:  Carbon tetrachloride treatment can be  used to specifically destroy 
the liver.

Question 11 continued 
 (e) The  sinusoids are  tubes that arise  from  single cells that associate to  form  a sheet  which eventua lly 
forms a tube. What  is the term  for  conversion of single  ce lls to cell sheets? 
 
 
 
 (f) What  changes will the fo llow ing perturbations have on single ce lls versus cell sheets? Your op tions 
are: death ; adhesion; movement; shape ; no change. For  each perturbation, select the most likely option(s)

(b) Hepatocytes are  differentiated liver ce lls. HNF4a is a  hepatocyte -specific transcription factor  
necessary for activa tion of  all liver  differentiation genes, including albumin. In order to  understand 
the mechanism  by which HNF4a  acts, you express HNF4a in the developing pancreas, which is also 
derived from  endoderm . In this case, expression of albumin and other liver-specific genes is not 
activated. Explain this observation. 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
(c) DNMT  is a DNA methylase , expressed throughout  development , which adds methyl groups to 
cytosine . You decide  to regenerate  animals by SCNT  using the  nuclei e ither  from adult hepatocytes, 40 
hour  embryonic hepatocytes, or  40 hour  hepatocytes treated w ith an inhibitor of the  DNA methlyase  
DNMT. Which of the three nuclei would be the best choice? Explain why you would prefer  one  over
