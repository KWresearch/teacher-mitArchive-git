d) You treat mouse epidermal cells in a plate with the drug, TAT-2. You observe that TAT-2 treated
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cells show reduced shortening of their chromosomes following each cell division and survive longer
 
  
 
 
than the untreated cells. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.	  Name the replication enzyme that serves as the target of TAT-2 and state whether TAT-2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
activates or inhibits the function of this enzyme.

 
 
 
 
TAT-2 activates the telomerases 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii. 	  Why does reduced shortening of chromosomes following each cell division promote long- term
 
 
 
 
 
survival of a cell? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Telomerase aids in repairing the ends of chromosomes that progressively shorten after each replication cycle. This
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
helps to preserve the genetic information that is crucial for the cell division, functioning and survival. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
e) In a separate experiment, you irradiate the mouse epidermal cells, growing on a plate, with UV light.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This treatment results in the formation of a thymine dimer (a covalently joined pair of T-bases shown as

Question 2 (18 points) 
The following is the DNA sequence for the transcription initiation region of Gene A that is expressed 
in epidermal cells of mice. Note: Part of the promoter region is boxed. Transcription begins at and 
includes the bold and underlined A/T base pair.  
 
 
 
5’----TGGACTGCTA  TAATAGCAGG  GCTGCCGAAT  GTGCTGCCAT  ACGGCCATGG TTCTTAAAGT----3’  
3’----ACCTGACGAT  ATTATCGTCC  CGACGGCTTA  CACGACGGTA  TGCCGGTACC AAGAATTTCA----5’ 
 
a) Which DNA strand (choose from top or bottom) serves as the template strand for transcription? 
 
b) Fill in the first 6 nucleotides of the primary/ nascent mRNA transcribed from Gene A. 5’AGGGCU3’ 
 
c) Fill in the first four amino acids of Protein A encoded by Gene A. Note: A codon chart is provided on 
the last page. You can detach the last page. 
N- met-cys-cys-his-C 
 
d) The last 5 amino acids (amino acid105- amino acid109) at the C- terminus of wild-type Protein A are 
indicated below. Each of these amino acids is critical for the proper folding of this protein. 
 
N - pro105-asn106-ser107-met108-leu109-C 
 
The DNA sequence encoding the above 5 amino acids is included within the sequence below.  
 
  5’-AACCGAATTCCATGTTATAGC-3’ 
Wild-type 
 
  3’-TTGGCTTAAGGTACAATATCG-5’ 
 
 
You isolate and sequence the following two different mutant alleles of Gene A that encode the above 5 
 
amino acids. Each mutant allele is due to a point mutation that is bold and underlined. Which of these 
       
 
mutants will  ALTER the folding of Protein A (Choose from mutant 1 or mutant 2)?  
 
  5’-AACCGTATTCCATGTTATAGC-3’ 
 
  5’-AACCAAATTCCATGTTATAGC-3’ 
Mutant 2                                                                
 
Mutant 1                                                 
                
  3’-TTGGCATAAGGTACAATATCG-5’ 
3’-TTGGTTTAAGGTACAATATCG-5’   
  
 
 
    
 
 
 
Explain, in terms of the change in the reading frame and/ or amino acid sequence, why you selected 
 
 
 
 
       
this mutant and NOT the other. 
       
 
 
 
 
Mutant 1 will not alter the folding of Protein A since this is an example of silent point mutation that 
 
 
 
 
does not alter the amino acid sequence of the protein. In comparison, Mutant 2 is an example of 
 
 
 
 
missense point mutation that changes the codon 5’AAU3’ (coding for asn106) to 5’UAU3’ (coding for 
tyr106) thus altering the folding of this protein. 
 
e) You identify a disease of epidermal cells in mice in which Gene A is not transcribed. Further 
analyses reveals that the sequence of Gene A in affected and normal mice is the SAME. Circle the 
options, from the choices below that could explain why Gene A is NOT transcribed in the epidermal 
cells of the affected mice.  In the epidermal cells of affected mice… 
 
1.  Mature mRNA corresponding to Gene A lacks the 5 methyl Cap and 3’ Poly A tail 
2.  DNA around the promoter region of Gene A is methylated 
3.  Epidermal cells of affected mice lack the transcription factors (TF) associated with Gene A. 
4.  The Ribosome binding site in mature mRNA transcript corresponding to Gene A is mutated 
5.  The 3’ untranslated region  (3’UTRs) of mature mRNA corresponding to Gene A is mutated 
6.  Histones close to the Gene A are acetylated

a) You observe that Gene A is transcribed both in epidermal and muscle cells to produce a nascent / 
primary mRNA transcript.  This mRNA directs the synthesis of two different proteins in these two 
different cell types.  
In the muscle cells Gene A encodes a protein (100 amino acids long) that functions as a nuclear protein 
• 
(TF-1)  
In epidermal cells, Gene A encodes a protein (200 amino acids long) that functions as a cell membrane 
protein. 
 
Could Gene A direct the synthesis of two different proteins due to the… 
 
Explain why you selected this option 
Difference in…. 
 
Splicing (Yes/ No)? 
These proteins can be produced from the same gene due to alternative splicing 
of introns i.e. if the splice donor site of Intron1 base pairs with splice acceptor 
site of Intron 2 you get a mature mRNA corresponding toTF-1. In 
comparison, if both Introns 1 & 2 are spliced out as two separate exons you get 
a mature mRNA transcript that encodes the cell membrane protein. 
Yes, if you assume that the nascent polypeptide chain in muscle cells is post-
translationally cleaved to form functional protein of 100KD but it does not get 
cleaved in epidermal cells. No, if you say that post translational modifications 
such as glycosylation or addition of lipids may alter the molecular weight of 
the proteins but will not have any impact on the primary amino acid length of 
the proteins. 
Promoter sequence  No, both proteins are encoded by the same gene and hence have the same 
(Yes/ No)? 
promoter. A change in the promoter sequence affects the amount of gene 
expression but does not influence the type of gene products encoded by a gene. 
 
b) You want to study another nuclear protein, TF-2 in mouse muscle cells. You identify a mutant cell 
line, which shows a cytosolic location of TF-2 in muscle cells. 
 
i.  Name a stretch of amino acid sequence that the TF-2 in mutant muscle cell line lacks. 
Nuclear localization sequence 
 
 
 
ii.  In the wild-type muscle cells, if this stretch of amino acid sequence is located at the N-terminus of 
TF-2, where in the mature mRNA transcript (choose from the 5’ end or the 3’ end) would the 
corresponding base sequence be? 
iii.  The proteasome is a multi-protein complex that degrades any misfolded protein in a cell. How 
does the proteasome recognize which proteins in the cell are misfolded?   
The proteasomes recognize the misfolded proteins once they are ubiquitinylated

d) Is the tRNA in the schematic charged or uncharged?

Question 4 (24 points) 
You decide to further characterize the TF-1 protein encoded by Gene A in muscle cells of mice. You 
adopt the following strategy to get a large amount of TF-1 protein for characterization. You make the 
cDNA using the mRNA derived from the wild- type allele of Gene A and by adding oligo- dT primers.

c) You then plan to amplify the recombinant plasmid in E. coli bacterial cells. You transform the E. coli 
with the ligation mix and plate them on a master plate (growth medium with no antibiotics). You then 
replica- plate the colonies on plate 1 (growth medium + ampicillin) and plate 2 (growth medium containing 
both ampicillin and kanamycin). You obtain the following colonies.  
 
i.  Circle the plate (1 or 2) in the schematic 
 
that contains bacterial colonies that have 
 
the recombinant plasmid. 

 

Plate 1 

Plate 2 

In the plate that you circled, fill in/ color 
 
the colonies that contain the recombinant 
plasmid. Explain why you selected these 
 
colonies. 
 
 
 
The recombinant plasmid will have an intact and functional AmpR gene but a disrupted KanR gene where Gene A 
is inserted. So any bacterial cell that will receive the recombinant plasmid will be AmpR KanS and will therefore 
grow on plate 1 but not on plate 2. 
 
d) Another group is competing with you. Although they have the bacterial clone that contains the 
recombinant plasmid with Gene A in correct orientation they cannot express Gene A in bacteria. To 
understand what the issue is they decide to PCR amplify and sequence Gene A isolated from their 
bacterial clone (mutant) and compare it with the sequence of Gene A that you published (wild- type). 
Shown below is the sequence flanking the mutant allele of Gene A.

e) Sequencing results show that the mutant version has one point mutation compared to the wild- type 
version of Gene A. Shown below is a portion of the fluorescence dideoxy- sequencing gel that gives the

Question 5 (18 points) 
You are studying a genetic disorder that is associated with a mutation at the Gene A locus. You identify 
two SNPs (SNP1& SNP2) that are tightly linked to Gene A. These SNPs flank Gene A as shown below.

Please note: All the individuals with the disease phenotype are shaded. People marrying into the family have only the wild-

Assume complete penetrance of the disease phenotype and NO Recombination between SNP1, SNP2 and Gene A.

3 ? 	  
	  
a) Give the most likely mode of inheritance of this disease.  X- linked recessive 
  
b) Give the genotype(s) of Individual 1 at Gene A locus based on her SNP1 & SNP2. Note: Use the letter 
“A” or XA to represent the allele associated with the dominant phenotype and ‘a” or Xa to represent the allele associated with 
the recessive phenotype. XAXA 
 
c) Give the alleles of SNP1 & SNP2 that are tightly linked with the allele of Gene A in Individual 2. 
  
SNP1: A or XA or XAY                         SNP2: T or XT or XTY 
 
d) If Individual #3 is a male, what is the probability that he will be affected?  50% 
 
e) The above disease is also observed in mice. You mate an affected female with an affected male to get 
a fertilized ovum. You then successfully introduce a wild- type allele of Gene A into the fertilized ovum 
and implant it into a pseudo-pregnant female mouse. You observe that it develops into a newborn 
male. 
 
i.  What would be the genotype of all somatic cell-types in this newborn? AXa or XAa Y  
 
ii.  Will the introduced gene be passed on to the subsequent generations by the transgenic mouse 
(choose from yes, no or may be)? Explain. 
The introduced transgene is stably integrated in the fertilized ovum. If integrates into an autosome it will be 
passed on to subsequent generation. But if it is introduced into the sex chromosome, then depending on whether 
the gametes receive the transgene it may or may not be passed on to subsequent generations. 
 
f) Why two SNPs flanking a Gene are regarded as better markers to predict its mode of inheritance 
compared to only one SNP located at one end of the Gene? 
This is because if the person inherits two SNPs that are tightly linked to and flank a gene, there is a much reduced 
chance of two recombination events. Or in other words the probability that the person has inherited the allele of 
the gene that is flanked between the two SNPs is much higher.
