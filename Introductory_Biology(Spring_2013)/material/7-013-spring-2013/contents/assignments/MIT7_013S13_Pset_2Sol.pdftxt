b) Give the likely genotypes with respect to body color and wing type for the following flies. Note: 
 
 
Please indicate the alleles associated with dominant phenotypes by uppercase letters and alleles associated with
 
recessive phenotypes by lowercase letters. Indicate the alleles for the body color as “A or a” and the alleles for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
wing type as “B or b”.

Is homozygous at only one locus?  P2

ii. 
 

Is homozygous at both loci?  P3 & P4 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d) If you were to do a test cross in order to identify the genotype of a fly that showed the dominant
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
phenotypes for both these traits, which of these flies  (P1-P4) would you mate your test fly with?
Explain why you selected this option.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You would mate your test fly with P3 fly since this fly will produce gametes that have the genotype “ab” i.e.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gametes that have alleles that regulate the recessive phenotypes. When these gametes will fuse with the gametes
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from the test fly, the resulting progeny will show all the possible genotypes of the test fly.

iv.  Give all the possible genotypes of the gametes that would be produced if non-disjunction 
occurred in Product I of Meiosis I that you have drawn in Part d(ii) on Page 2. 
There are two possibilities. 
Possibility 1:  If you have drawn product 1 of meiosis 1 as the one shown in this solution key then you will get 
four gametes with the following genotypes. 
Gamete 1 having genotype "AAbb", Gamete 2 lacking the chromosome that has these two genes (most likely this 
gamete will not be viable), Gamete 3 having genotype "aB", Gamete 4 having genotype "aB.  
Possibility 2:  If you have drawn product 1 of meiosis 1 as the one shown as product 2 in this solution key then 
you will get four gametes with the following genotypes. 
Gamete 1 having genotype "aaBB", Gamete 2 lacking the chromosome that has these two genes (most likely this 
gamete will not be viable), Gamete 3 having genotype "Ab", Gamete 4 having genotype "Ab.

Experiment 
#2: P1 with P3 
 

i.  Are your diagrams consistent with the results?  
No, these diagrams are not consistent with the above results since you are getting only two sets of gametes one 
set having genotype "Ab" and the other having the genotype "aB". In order to get the result shown in the table 
above you need to have four gametes of genotypes "Ab", "aB", "AB" and "ab". When a fly producing these 
gametes is crossed with a double homozygous recessive fly having the genotype “aabb” that produce four gametes 
all have the same genotype (ab) you can get four different phenotypic classes that are outlined in the table. 
 
ii. 
If not, what must occur to obtain the results of Experiment 2?  
You can get 4 gametes each having a different genotype if and only if there occurs recombination event or 
crossing over between the two non-sister chromatids of the homologous chromosomes during meiosis 1. 
 
iii.  What do the results of Experiment 2 suggest about the distance between the genes that regulate 
body color and wing type? 
It suggests that the two genes in question are located on the same chromosome but they are 50 map units or 50cM 
apart that allows them to recombine to produce four gametes with equal frequency each having a different 
genotype i.e. these genes are unlinked and they assort as per the Mendelian genetics.

Question 3 
You are working with flies that can be broadly categorized as aggressive or mild and red or grey. You 
decide to study the genes responsible for these two traits. Note: Use the letters “A”, and “a” for temperament 
(aggressive or mild) and “B” and “b” for body color (red or grey). Use the uppercase letter to represent the alleles associated 
with the dominant phenotypes and the lowercase letters to represent the alleles associated with the recessive phenotypes. 
  
a) You mate a true breeding aggressive and red fly with a mild and grey fly.  You find that all the flies 
in the F1 generation are aggressive and grey. You take an F1 generation female fly and test cross her 
with a true breeding male fly and score 1600 progeny. 
i.  Give the genotype and phenotype of the male fly in the test cross. 
 
Phenotype:   mild & red 
 
 
 
Genotype:  aabb 
 
If the genes for the two characters (traits) are 10cM apart, write the genotypes and 
corresponding phenotypes of the different classes of flies that you would expect. Also write the 
approximate number of flies that you would expect for each class.

b) You are also interested in the additional following traits for the same flies. 
 
•  Antennae length, with long antennae being dominant (N) over short antennae (n).   
•  Wing size, with wings (D) being dominant over wingless (d).  
  
You perform the following crosses. 
•  You  cross  a  true  breeding  fly  having  grey  body  color  and  long  antennae with  a  true  breeding  fly  having 
red  body  color  and  short  antennae.    A  test  cross  with  a  resulting  F1  fly  gives  320  recombinant  progeny 
from a total of 1600 flies in F2.  
  
•  You  cross  a  true  breeding  aggressive  fly  having  long  antennae  with  a  true  breeding  mild  fly  with  short 
antennae. A  test  cross with  a  resulting  F1  fly  gives  480  recombinant  progeny  from  a  total  of  1600  flies  in 
F2.  
  
•  You cross a true breeding grey fly having wings with a true breeding red, wingless fly. A test cross with a 
resulting F1 fly gives 640 recombinant progeny from a total of 1600 flies in F2.  
•  You  cross  a  true  breeding  aggressive  fly  having  wings  with  a  true  breeding  mild,  wingless  fly.  A  test 
cross with a resulting F1 fly gives 800 recombinant progeny from a total of 1600 flies in F2.  
Based on the results of the crosses above, answer the following questions.  
 
i.  Which pairs of genes are exhibiting classical Mendelian inheritance? 
A and D genes since they are 50 CM apart. 
ii.  Draw  a  chromosomal map  to  show  the  approximate map  distance  between  the  genes  for  body 
color, temperament, antennae length and wing size.

Question 4 
Your friend is studying two characteristics in mice: response to an infection (susceptible or resistant) and 
alertness (alert or lazy). Each of these traits is regulated by one gene. You cross a true-breeding alert 
mouse (mouse 1) that is resistant to infection with a true-breeding lazy mouse that is susceptible to 
infection (mouse 2). All of the resulting F1 mice are alert but susceptible to infection.  
 
a) What are the genotypes of mouse 1 and mouse 2? Note: In each case, use the uppercase letter for the allele 
associated with the dominant phenotype and the lowercase letter for the allele associated with the recessive 
phenotype. For the response to an infection (i.e. susceptible or resistant) use D or d to designate the alleles. For 
alertness (i.e. alert or lazy) use G or g to designate the alleles. 
 
Mouse 1:  
 
 
 
Mouse 2:  
ddGG 

 
 
b) You do a test cross with an F1 mouse and obtain 100 offspring. Assuming that the two genes are 
unlinked, give all possible genotypes and phenotypes of the mice that you will obtain in F2. 
Phenotype of the F2 mice 
Genotype of the F2 mice 
 
Dgdg 
Susceptible and lazy 
dGdg 
Alert and resistant 
Alert and susceptible 
DGdg 
dgdg 
Lazy and resistant 
c) If you obtain 100 mice in F2, approximately how many of these would be susceptible and alert? 
 
25 
 
d) You also want to study the following genes in the same mice. 
•  A gene  that  regulates  the  fur  color, which  is  either grey  (dominant  trait  represented by allele A) or white 
(recessive  trait  represented  by  allele  a).  The  map  distance  between  this  gene  and  the  gene  that 
regulates alertness is 20cM.  
•  A gene that regulates appetite, which is either hearty (dominant trait represent by the letter B) or weak 
(recessive trait, represented by the letter b). You find that the map distance between this gene and the 
gene that regulates fur color is 9cM. 
There are two genetic maps consistent with this information.  Propose a mating experiment that would 
allow you to draw a genetic map showing the position of the genes regulating alertness, fur color and 
appetite. For each of the possible maps, give % of each class of progeny that would be consistent. 
The two possibilities are shown below: 
 
9cM 
(i): 
(Gene regulating appetite) 
 alleles: B, b 
 
 
(ii): 
 
 
You can set up one of the following two mating experiments: 
Experiment #1: Mate a true- breeding hearty/ susceptible mouse (genotype: BBGG) with a true- breeding 
weak/alert mouse (genotype: bbgg) to obtain hearty/ susceptible mice (genotype: BbGg) in F1 generation. Now 
mate an F1 mouse with a true- breeding weak/ alert mouse (genotype: bbgg). You will get 29% recombinants 
(hearty/ alert; genotype Bgbg and weak/ susceptible; genotype bGbg) if possibility (i) is correct or 11 
%recombinants (recombinants (hearty/ alert; genotype Bgbg and weak/susceptible; genotype bGbg) if possibility 
(ii) is correct.

Question 4 continued 
Experiment #2: Mate a true- breeding hearty/ alert mouse (genotype: BBgg) with a true- breeding 
weak/susceptible mouse (genotype: bbGG) to obtain hearty/ susceptible mice (genotype: BbGg) in F1 generation. 
Now mate an F1 mouse with a true- breeding weak/ alert mouse (genotype: bbgg). You will obtain 29% 
recombinants (hearty/ susceptible; genotype BGbg and weak/alert; genotype bgbg) if possibility (i) is correct or 11 
%recombinants (hearty/ susceptible; genotype BGbg and weak/alert; genotype bgbg) if possibility (ii) is correct. 
 
 
Question 5 
As a plant geneticist, you have identified three traits that contribute to the taste of certain coffee beans. 
You isolate strains of coffee plants that breed true for each trait. The strains produce beans that can be 
either nutty or plain (use A or a); 2) bitter or smooth (use B or b); and caffeinated or decaffeinated (use 
D or d). Note: In each case, use the uppercase letter for the allele associated with the dominant phenotype and the 
lowercase letter for the allele associated with the recessive phenotype. 
 
You cross a true breeding nutty, smooth, decaffeinated strain to a true breeding plain, bitter, and 
caffeinated strain.  The first (F1) generation is 100 plants: 
 
20 nutty, bitter, caffeinated 
 
80 nutty, smooth, caffeinated 
 
a) Which of these traits are NOT exhibiting classic Mendelian inheritance?  Taste (bitter or smooth) 
 
b) Which traits are dominant Mendelian traits?   Nutty and caffeinated 
 
 
c) You cross two F1 plants: 
 
nutty, smooth, caffeinated 
nutty, bitter, caffeinated    X  
 
If there are 640 plants in the F2 generation, give all the possible phenotypic classes you expect to see. 
Give the total number and the ratio of progeny in each phenotypic class. Note: Please ignore the traits 
that do not exhibit Mendelian inheritance.  
 
The four different classes in F2 and their corresponding ratios would be Nutty and caffeinated: Nutty and 
decaffeinated: plain and caffeinated: plain and decaffeinated = (9:3:3:1) 
 
Question 6  
In this exercise you will use StarGenetics, a software that simulates mating experiments to analyze the 
nature and mode of inheritance of specific genetic traits. To get to StarGenetics, please navigate to 
http://web.mit.edu/star/genetics. Click on the Start button to launch the application. Allow the 
application to run on the computer. Click on File -> New on the main menu. On the Welcome page, 
click on Fruit fly Exercise -3.  
 
You catch two fruit flies; one of these flies is male and the other is female.  Both flies have a very 
unusual phenotype: blue eyes and white body color. You put these flies in a vial and several days 
later, you return to find that this vial is full of blue-eyed, white-bodied flies!  The two flies that you 
caught have mated and it turns out that they are true breeding for the alleles that determine eye and 
body color!  You decide to find out if the genes that determine these two traits are linked or unlinked.  
When you come back to the lab, you discover that all of your blue-eye, white-body color flies have died 
except for one female.  You are determined to test for gene linkage, though.  To do so, you need to 
accomplish the following two tasks: 
 

6 

 

Question 6 continued 
•  First, you need to generate more blue-eye, white-body color flies by designing mating experiments using 
your one remaining blue-eye, white-body color female and a common laboratory fruit fly stock with a well 
characterized genetic background.   
•  Following this, you can perform mating experiment to determine if the two genes that determine the 
traits of interest are linked. 
 
a) Give the phenotype of the two flies in the “strains window” available for your initial mating 
experiment. Note: Click on each fly to view its phenotype. 
 
Male Fly:  Grey body & red eye  
Female fly: White body color and blue eye 

7 

	   
b) To generate more flies with blue eyes and white body color, you set up a mating experiment 
between the two available flies. Note: You can set up a mating experiment by dragging the chosen parent flies 
to the Mating site and then clicking on the “MATE” button. Mating results are summarized on the Summary. 
You can also view the phenotypes by clicking the “SUMMARY->SHOW TAB” tab.  
 
i.  Describe the different phenotype(s) that you observe among the 50 F1 progeny and indicate 
how many of each type you observe. 
32 males with grey body color and blue eyes and 28 females with grey body color and red eye (Note: the 
numbers can be different for each experiment but the ratio should be approx 1:1). 
 
Indicate which phenotypes for eye and body color are dominant and which are recessive.  
ii. 
Grey body color is dominant to white body color and red eye color is dominant to blue eye color. 
The genes regulating which trait (choose from body color or eye color) are located on the X 
iii. 
chromosome? Eye color 
c) Indicate genotypes for the following flies. Note: Use letters B and b for the alleles that regulate body color.  
Use letters E and e for the alleles that regulate eye color. For each gene, use the upper case letter to represent the 
allele associated with the dominant phenotype and the lowercase letter to represent the allele associated with the 
recessive phenotype.

d) Design a mating experiment that would enable you to confirm your answer to part b (iii).  Indicate 
genotypes and phenotypes of the flies that you will mate.  Diagram the mating experiment and predic
the genotypes and phenotypes of the resulting progeny.  Note:  This part of the question is optional 
and will not be graded. You can choose and drag the fly from your experiment to the Mating site. Click on sav
experiment. To start a new mating experiment click on the New experiment button and then click on the Mate 
button as described earlier.  
 
Cross female F1 progeny to Parent 2.  We expect to see that all progeny are gray-bodied.  All females should have
 
wild-type eyes, while 50% of males will have blue eyes and 50% of males will have wild- type eyes.  The expected
 
genotype frequencies are:
