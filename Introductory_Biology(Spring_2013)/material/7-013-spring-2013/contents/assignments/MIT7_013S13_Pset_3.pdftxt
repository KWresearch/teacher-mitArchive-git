Question 2
a) Complete the table below for a eukaryotic cell, by choosing from the following keywords. If there  is 
more  than  one  good  choice,  include  all.  Choose  from  lysosomes,  rough  endoplasmic  reticulum  (RER),  golgi 
body,  nucleus,  mitochondria,  smooth  endoplasmic  reticulum  (SER)  cytoskeleton,  extracellular  matrix  (ECM), 
ribosomes, nucleolus and cell membrane. 
Description 

Location or organelle 
in a eukaryotic cell 
 

 
 

The location of circular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)  
The location of enzymes, in a eukaryotic cell, that are involved in digesting 
cell’s own toxic material. The abnormal functioning of these enzymes may 
result in Tay Sachs disease. 
 
Membrane  bound  tubules  that  are  involved  in  lipid  metabolism  and 
cholesterol synthesis and are NOT studded with ribsosomes 
 
The component of cells where the ribosomes are synthesized 
The  final  location  of  proteins  that  glue  the  eukaryotic  cells  together  and 
may participate in cell-cell communication 
 
Membrane  bound  tubules  that  are  involved  in  protein  synthesis  and  are 
studded with ribsosomes 
 
Stacked  membrane  bound  tubules,  in  a  eukaryotic  cell,  where  a  newly 
synthesized  protein  goes  through  post-translational  modification  i.e. 
glycosylation and phosphorylation. 
 
Non-membrane  bound  structures  that  are  involved  in  protein  synthesis 
and comprised of RNA and proteins 
 
The  final  location of proteins  that are a part of a dynamic network of  fibers 
that maintain the shape and motility of a cell 
 
 
b) You label the DNA of a eukaryotic cells using BrdU (a thymidine analog). You then remove the
nucleus of this cell (enucleated cell). You are surprised to see that the enucleated cell still has some
DNA that is BrdU labeled. How can you explain  this?  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

c)  Ebola  is  a  hemorrhagic  virus,  which  disrupts  the  blood  vessels.  A  recent  publication  demonstrated 
that  this  virus  gains  entry  into  the  cells with  the  aid  of  the  lysosomal protein NPC,  found  in  the  target 
cells.  Briefly describe an experiment that supports the involvement of NPC proteins in Ebola infection.

Question 3 continued 
e) While studying replication in a bacterial cell type you find a mutant that shows a 100 fold decrease in 
the fidelity of replication.  
 
i.  Name the protein(s)/enzyme(s) that is mutated in this bacterial mutant and accounts for
decreased replication fidelity. 

 
 

ii. 

ii.  What particular activity does this protein(s)/ enzyme(s) lack that regulates the fidelity of
replication? 

 
 
f) The DNA polymerase enzyme binds to the “ori site” and starts elongating the 3’OH end of the RNA
primer by adding the nucleotide bases that are complementary to the sequence of the template DNA 
strand. Each replication cycle results in the shortening of chromosomal ends.  
Explain why the Ori site in general is rich in adenine (A) and thymine (T) bases.
i. 
 
 
 
The rate of mitotic cell division in an embryonic cell is much higher compared to a normal
somatic cell in an adult. Briefly explain how the telomerase activity may regulate the number of
mitotic divisions a cell can have during its life- time.   

g) DNA, unlike RNA, is stable and therefore serves as the hereditary material for most organisms.  
i.  What feature of RNA makes it less stable than DNA? 

ii. 

The fidelity of transcription is always less than the fidelity of replication. Explain why is this so.  

iii.  A  cell  much  better  tolerates  errors  during  transcription  than  errors  during  DNA  replication.  
Explain why is this so.

Question 4 continued
c) You realize that Gene 1 is expressed in intestinal cells of mice and mutations in this gene are 
associated with Crohn’s disease. Further analysis reveals… 
•  That the coding sequence of Gene 1 is the same in affected and wild- type mice.  
•  There is much less of mature mRNA transcribed from Gene 1 in the affected mice relative to that in the 
wild-type mice.   
•  The intestinal cells of the affected mice show no detectable protein unlike the wild-type mice. 
 Give two possible modifications of RNA, whose absence may explain the differences that you have 
observed between the affected and wild- type mice. 

 

ii. 

d) Gene 2 is expressed in mouse heart muscle cells and its over-expression (too much of it) is associated 
with heart disease.  You try to reduce the expression of Gene 2 using a particular micro RNA (miRNA-
32) that you think may regulate Gene 2. 
 
i.  Circle the sequence (choose from promoter, nascent (primary) RNA, mature mRNA, 5' UTR and 3’ 
UTR) to which the miRNA is most likely to bind?   
Briefly describe how the miRNA may inhibit expression of Gene 2. 
 
 
 
e) From your 7.013 lectures, you have learnt that although almost all cells in an organism contain an 
identical genome, gene expression differs in different cell types and is highly regulated by chromatin 
structure. Given the following treatments, explain whether chromatin structure compacts or becomes 
less compact and whether gene expression is enhanced or reduced. 
 
i.  Cells are treated with DNA methylase, an enzyme that adds methyl groups to cytosine bases in
DNA.

ii.

Cells are treated with histone acetylase, an enzyme that adds acetyl groups to the histone
proteins thus making them less basic. 

 
 
 
f) As we mentioned in lecture, Prader-Willi (PW) syndrome is a rare disorder that results in intellectual
disability, a constant sense of hunger and obesity. This syndrome is caused by deletion or inactivation 
of seven genes that lie on Chromosome 15. Normally, these genes are INACTIVE on the maternally-
contributed chromosome, but ACTIVE on the paternally-contributed chromosome. PW syndrome 
occurs because the paternal genes that should be expressed are not for one of the following reasons:  
•  Paternal genes on chromosome 15 are missing or defective. 
•  The patient has inherited two copies of chromosome 15 from the mother and no chromosome 15 from the 
father.  

i.  Of what is the PW syndrome an example? Explain the reasoning behind this answer.

ii.
You isolate cells from a PW patient and try to activate the Chromosome 15 genes. Circle the
option from below that you would try. Explain your reasoning. 
•  Treat cells with 5-azacytidine that inhibits DNA methylase 
•  Treat cells with 2-chloroethyl-N-nitrosourea (CNU) that activates DNA methylase.

Question 7 
Following are three genes that encode small peptides. The splice site donor always has the composition 
5’-GUG-3’ (i.e. for the 5’ end of the splice site) and the splice site acceptor always has the sequence 5’-
UUG-3’ (i.e. for the 3’ end of the splice site), meaning that these sequences and everything between 
them will be removed from the mature mRNA. Only the non-template/ mRNA like strands of DNA 
for each gene are shown. Note: A vertical line is drawn after every 10th base in each sequence. The bold and 
underlined ATG represents the correct reading frame.
