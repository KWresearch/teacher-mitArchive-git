(CTL) immune response. 
 
Show rearrangement of specific gene(s) and do not have  TH, Tc, memory B cells (and plasma cells)

presenting site of this molecule by drawing a triangle. MHC 
•  Can  recognize  the  antigen  after  it  has  been  presented  on  the  surface  of  an  infected  cell  or  an

iii.  Diagram the interaction of the molecules above with the antigens on…  
•  An  APC  cell  that  is  interacting  with  and  activating  a  TH  cell.  Note:  Include  the  relevant 
molecules on your schematic (choose from antigen (Ag), TcR, MHC-1, MHC-II, CD4 and CD8).

•  A  virus  infected  somatic  cell  interacting  with  and  activating  a  TC  cell.  Note:  Include  the 
relevant  molecules  on  your  schematic  (choose  from  antigen  (Ag),  TcR,  MHC-1,  MHC-II,  CD4

c)  The  diverse  array  of  TcR  and  the  antibodies  is  generated  by  DNA  rearrangement.    However  this 
diversity  is  further  enhanced  by  the  function  of  enzymes  like  terminal  transferases.    Briefly  explain 
how the activity of terminal transferase enzymes further contributes to antibody diversity.  
This  enzyme  can  add  bases  at  the  point  of  joining  of  the  V,  D  and  J  segments  of  the  antibody  gene.  This 
contributes to further diversity. 
 
d) Although the immune system has the IgG and the IgM antibody molecules with the antigen- binding 
site against the same antigen these two classes of antibody have very different structure.  
 
i.  Name  the  process  that  contributes  to  the  variation  between  the  structure  of  IgG  and  IgM 
molecules that are specific to the same antigen. 
Alternative splicing 
ii.  Circle  the  cells  types  that  produce  and  secrete  IgG  (choose  from  mature  B  cells,  memory  B  cells, 
Plasma cells). 
 
iii.  Circle the cells types that produce IgM (choose from mature B cells, memory B cells, Plasma cells). 
 
e)  Very  rarely,  the  immune  system  in  some  individuals  may  produce  cells  that  can  recognize  “self- 
antigens”.  These  individuals  therefore  develop  autoimmune  diseases  such  as  lupus,  rheumatoid 
arthritis, diabetic mellitus and multiple  sclerosis.   Briefly describe how  the  self-reacting T or B  cells are 
eliminated during the development of immune system in a normal heatlthy individuals. 
These  cells  with  self-  reacting  antigens  are  contained  during  development  and  eventually  eliminated  by  clonal 
deletion/ negative selection. So they will not be able to reach and attack other tissues.  
 
f)  Organ  transplant  is  required  in  various  clinical  conditions.    One  has  to  consider  various  criteria  in 
order to reduce the chances of transplant rejection. 
 
i.  Name the surface molecule(s) that is critical in preventing transplant rejection. MHC-I 
 
Is this molecule(s) expressed on the surface of ALL nucleated cell (Yes/ No)? Explain your 
ii. 
choice. 
Yes, since different cell pathogens can infect different cell types, which can present the antigens through their 
MHC-I.

Question 2 
You purify a novel viral protein (Protein R) and intend to further characterize it. Accordingly, you 
develop antibodies against Protein R. You inject Protein R into a rabbit, draw out some blood from the 
rabbit after a month and confirm the presence of Protein R specific antibody in the rabbit’s blood. You 
wait for two months and then re-inject Protein R into the same rabbit.  You observe a stronger 
secondary immune response developing within a few days against Protein R. 
 
a) On the graph below… 
 
i.  Draw the primary and secondary immune responses as a solid line (-) specific to Protein R. 
ii.  Draw the alteration in the concentration of Protein R as a dashed line (------)during the primary 
and secondary immune responses. 

 

 

 

 

 
Note: please look at SLIDE 9 of Immunology –II lecture 
 
iii.  Why is the primary immune response slower and weaker compared to the secondary immune 
response? 
During the primary immune response, the memory B cells, against the specific antigen, are generated by the 
proliferation of the mature B cells that are specific to that antigen. These B cells express surface IgM molecules 
against the specific antigen. Furthermore, they can also proliferate to form more memory B cells and also the 
plasma cells that produce and secrete the IgG antibody to counteract the antigen infection. During the secondary 
immune response, the memory B and memory T- helper cells generated during the primary immune response 
immediately start proliferating to generate more of their own kind and also make the plasma cells to counteract 
the viral infection thus making the response faster and stronger compared to primary response. 
 
c) Circle all the correct options from the following choices. The innate immune response… 
i.  Occurs only in response to first injection. 
ii.  Occurs only in response to second injection. 
iii.  Occurs in response to both injections. 
iv.  Is non-specific unlike the adaptive immune response. 

 
d) Briefly describe two major mechanisms by which the secreted antibodies destroy a virus circulating 
in the blood stream. 
The following are the three major mechanisms for antigen disposal: Neutralization: The antibodies bind to the 
antigens located on the surface of the virus and neutralize it by blocking its ability to bind to a host cell. 
Opsonization: The antibodies bind to the antigens on the bacterial surface to promote the phagocytosis of the 
bacteria by macrophages. Activation of complement system: The antibodies bind to an antigen located on the 
surface of a foreign cell to activate the complement system, which then forms a membrane attack unit. This unit 
forms pores in the membrane of the foreign cells allowing water and ions to rush in. The foreign cell therefore 
swells and ultimately dies (But this was not covered in the lecture and you are not responsible for this).

Question 2 continued 
e) Your friend decides to inject an attenuated form of the virus into a rabbit instead of injecting only 
Protein R derived from this virus.  
 
i.  What additional immune response will be observed in this rabbit compared to your 
experimental rabbit?  
This will also show the TC mediated killing of the infected cells along with the humoral immune response. 
 
ii.  How does this additional immune response in part (i) destroy the virus- infected cells? 
The activated TC will secrete perforin proteins that can make holes in the membrane of the infected cells leading to 
its killing. They may also activate granzymes, which causes the apoptosis of the infected cells. 
 
Question 3 
a) You come across an article online titled “How Carrot-Chocolate Shakes Improve Memory?” The 
summary reads: “After drinking Carrot-Chocolate shake mix, mice show an immediate (within 10 
seconds) increase in memory of where treats are located.  The authors of the study claim that the 
shake…  
i. 
Increases the amplitude of the action potential in hippocampal neurons (involved in memory) 
from +55mV to +90mV. 
 
ii.  Changes the threshold potential from -50mV to -40mV.  
 
iii. 
Furthermore, it works by targeting the metabotropic AMPA receptors.  
 
For each of the claims made, indicate whether the claim is valid and explain your answer.    
The amplitude of the action potential and the threshold potential is always constant for a type of neuron and it 
does not change. It is only the frequency of action potential that can change based on factors such as the intensity 
of the stimulus or the amount of neurotransmitter etc. Hence Claim 1 and Claim 2 are invalid. The article claims 
that the ingredient of this shake targets the metabotropic receptors. These receptors by definition as slow acting 
and hence their activation cannot explain the sudden increase in the memory (within 10 sec). Thus one can argue 
that Claim 3 is also invalid. 
 
b) On the same site, you read the following. 
i. 
Feeding mice the protein called the “Na+K+ATPase pump” improves their memory.  
 
This pump is essential for transmitting a signal along a neuron.  
ii. 
 
iii. 
It is not used anywhere else in the body.” 
 
For each of the claims made, indicate whether the claim is valid and explain your answer.    
Each cell type in the body has a resting membrane potential that is established by the action of Na+K+ATPase 
pump and open channels. The resting membrane potential value may vary between different cell types but is fixed 
for a specific cell type.  So Claim 3 and Claim 1 are invalid since Na+K+ ATPase pump is an inherent part of the 
plasma membrane of ALL cell types and is needed for maintaining their resting membrane potential. It however 
does not contribute to the generation of an action potential or transmitting a signal across the length of a  neuron 
Hence Claim 2 is also invalid. 
 
c) The depolarization phase of the action potential is generated by the passage of ions through… 
i. 
The resting ion channels  
 
ii.  Voltage-gated ion channels  
iii.  G-protein coupled receptors that are associated with a ligand gated K+ channels. 
iv. 
The sodium potassium ATPase pump

Is this an example of active 
transport or diffusion?  
 

    Active transport 
 Diffusion 

a) In response to GABA, would you expect both types 
of receptors to activate ion flow with the same time 
course? Explain. 
No. In response to GABA, since the GABA-B receptor first 
has to activate G proteins before the associated ion channel 
can be opened. This takes more time than directly opening 
the ion channel of the GABA-A receptor. 
 

Na+K+ ATPase pump 
 
Open K+ channel 
 
 
Question 4  
GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in central nervous system (CNS). It acts by binding to 
GABA-A receptors that are chloride channels and GABA-B receptors that activate K+ channels via G 
proteins.  
G proteins 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Post-synaptic 
 
b) K+ concentration is high inside the neuron, while Ca2+, Na+ and Cl- ion concentrations are high 
outside. Passage of Na+ into the neuron is responsible for an action potential. 
 
i. 
In what direction will Cl- ions flow when the GABA-A receptor is activated – in or out of the 
neuron? 
The Cl- ion will move inside and shift the membrane potential even further away from threshold. 
 
ii.  How does this flow alter the likelihood of an action potential in the post-synaptic neuron? 
Explain.  
Due to the flow of Cl- ions from outside to inside of the neuron, the inside of the neuron will have a membrane 
potential further away from the threshold. Therefore it will be less likely to activate an action potential.

Question 4 continued 
c) You culture a GABAergic neuron (i.e. one that produces GABA) in the presence of the following 
neurotoxins in two separate petri-plates (Plate A & Plate B). 
 
•  Plate A: Neuron is treated with tetraethylammonium (TEA), which inhibits voltage gated K+ channels. 
 
•  Plate B: Neuron is treated with tetradotoxin (TTX), which inhibits voltage gated Na  channels.

A normal action potential in a GABA secreting neuron that has been stimulated in the absence of any 
neurotoxin has been drawn in each panel above. Sketch the alteration in the action potential following 
the treatment of the neuron with each neurotoxin.  Note: If there is no change please write “NO CHANGE” 
on the graph. 
 
d) Give two possible mechanisms by which GABA is removed from the synapse? 
It may either be take back by the pre-synaptic neuron (re-uptake) or it may be degraded. 
 
e) Consider the following synapse between two neurons.  
 
•  Neuron 1 when stimulated secretes epinephrine. This neuron expresses the GABA-A and GABA-B 
receptors. 
•   
•  Neuron 2 when stimulated secretes GABA. 
 
If neuron 2 is pre- synaptic and neuron 1 is post- synaptic would you expect Neuron 1 to secrete 
epinephrine? Explain your choice.  
No, since GABA will bind to its receptor and move the membrane potential away from threshold. 
f) A functional neuron may receive both excitatory and inhibitory signals from multiple neurons at the 
synaptic junctions. In a post- synaptic neuron, where are the signals from all the pre- synaptic 
excitatory or inhibitory synapses integrated and the decision to fire an action potential made? Circle 
the correct options from the following choices and explain why you circled this option.

Axon Hillock   
Myelin Sheath  
Synaptic Cleft 
 
The deporalization of membrane depends in related to the opening of voltage gated Na+ channels, which are 
absent in cell body and located at the axon starting from axon hillock.

Question 4 continued 
g) The following schematic shows two excitatory pre-synaptic neurons that independently converge 
on a post-synaptic neuron. The two pre-synaptic neurons can be stimulated individually. In the 
absence of any stimulation, the recording electrode in the post-synaptic neuron measures the 
membrane potential as -60mV.

If only one excitatory pre-synaptic neuron is stimulated, you record a deviation from -60mV with the 
recording electrode in the post-synaptic neuron, but you do not record an action potential. If both the 
excitatory pre-synaptic neurons are stimulated, you record an action potential in the post-synaptic 
neuron.
