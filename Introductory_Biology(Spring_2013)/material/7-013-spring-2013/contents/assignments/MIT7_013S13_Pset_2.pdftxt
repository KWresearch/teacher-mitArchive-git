i.  Are your diagrams consistent with the results? 
 
 
If not, what must occur to obtain the results of Experiment 2? 
 
 
 
iii.  What do the results of Experiment 2 suggest about the distance between the genes that regulate 
body color and wing type? 

 
 
 
 
 
Question 3 
You are working with flies that can be broadly categorized as aggressive or mild and red or grey. You 
decide to study the genes responsible for these two traits. Note: Use the letters “A”, and “a” for temperament 
(aggressive or mild) and “B” and “b” for body color (red or grey). Use the uppercase letter to represent the alleles associated 
with the dominant phenotypes and the lowercase letters to represent the alleles associated with the recessive phenotypes. 
  
a) You mate a true breeding aggressive and red fly with a mild and grey fly.  You find that all the flies 
in the F1 generation are aggressive and grey. You take an F1 generation female fly and test cross her 
with a true breeding male fly and score 1600 progeny. 
  
i.  Give the genotype and phenotype of the male fly in the test cross.

b) You are also interested in the additional following traits for the same flies. 
 
•  Antennae length, with long antennae being dominant (N) over short antennae (n).   
•  Wing size, with wings (D) being dominant over wingless (d).  
  
You perform the following crosses. 
•  You  cross  a  true  breeding  fly  having  grey  body  color  and  long  antennae with  a  true  breeding  fly  having 
red  body  color  and  short  antennae.    A  test  cross  with  a  resulting  F1  fly  gives  320  recombinant  progeny 
from a total of 1600 flies in F2.  
  
•  You  cross  a  true  breeding  aggressive  fly  having  long  antennae  with  a  true  breeding  mild  fly  with  short 
antennae. A  test  cross with  a  resulting  F1  fly  gives  480  recombinant  progeny  from  a  total  of  1600  flies  in 
F2.  
  
•  You cross a true breeding grey fly having wings with a true breeding red, wingless fly. A test cross with a 
resulting F1 fly gives 640 recombinant progeny from a total of 1600 flies in F2.  
•  You  cross  a  true  breeding  aggressive  fly  having  wings  with  a  true  breeding  mild,  wingless  fly.  A  test 
cross with a resulting F1 fly gives 800 recombinant progeny from a total of 1600 flies in F2.  
 
Based on the results of the crosses above, answer the following questions.  
 
i.  Which pairs of genes are exhibiting classical Mendelian inheritance? 
 
ii.  Draw  a  chromosomal map  to  show  the  approximate map  distance  between  the  genes  for  body 
color, temperament, antennae length and wing size. 

  
  
  
 
Question 4 
Your friend is studying two characteristics in mice: response to an infection (susceptible or resistant) and 
alertness (alert or lazy). Each of these traits is regulated by one gene. You cross a true-breeding alert 
mouse (mouse 1) that is resistant to infection with a true-breeding lazy mouse that is susceptible to 
infection (mouse 2). All of the resulting F1 mice are alert but susceptible to infection.  
 
a) What are the genotypes of mouse 1 and mouse 2? Note: In each case, use the uppercase letter for the allele 
associated with the dominant phenotype and the lowercase letter for the allele associated with the recessive 
phenotype. For the response to an infection (i.e. susceptible or resistant) use D or d to designate the alleles. For 
alertness (i.e. alert or lazy) use G or g to designate the alleles.

Question 4 continued 
b) You do a test cross with an F1 mouse and obtain 100 offspring. Assuming that the two genes are 
unlinked, give all possible genotypes and phenotypes of the mice that you will obtain in F2. 
 
Genotype of the F2 mice 
Phenotype of the F2 mice 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) If you obtain 100 mice in F2, approximately how many of these would be susceptible and alert? 
 
 
 
d) You also want to study the following genes in the same mice. 
 
•  A gene  that  regulates  the  fur  color, which  is  either grey  (dominant  trait  represented by allele A) or white 
(recessive  trait  represented  by  allele  a).  The  map  distance  between  this  gene  and  the  gene  that 
regulates alertness is 20cM.  
•  A gene that regulates appetite, which is either hearty (dominant trait represent by the letter B) or weak 
(recessive trait, represented by the letter b). You find that the map distance between this gene and the 
gene that regulates fur color is 9cM. 
 
There are two genetic maps consistent with this information.  Propose a mating experiment that would 
allow you to draw a genetic map showing the position of the genes regulating alertness, fur color and 
appetite. For each of the possible maps, give % of each class of progeny that would be consistent. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 5 
As a plant geneticist, you have identified three traits that contribute to the taste of certain coffee beans. 
You isolate strains of coffee plants that breed true for each trait. The strains produce beans that can be 
either nutty or plain (use A or a); 2) bitter or smooth (use B or b); and caffeinated or decaffeinated (use 
D or d). Note: In each case, use the uppercase letter for the allele associated with the dominant phenotype and the 
lowercase letter for the allele associated with the recessive phenotype. 
 
You cross a true breeding nutty, smooth, decaffeinated strain to a true breeding plain, bitter, and 
caffeinated strain.  You obtain 100 plants in F1 generation with the following traits. 
 
20 nutty, bitter, caffeinated 
 
80 nutty, smooth, caffeinated 
 
a) Which of the above traits  are NOT exhibiting classic Mendelian inheritance?

b) Which traits are dominant Mendelian traits?   
 
 
 
c) You cross two F1 plants: 
 
nutty, smooth, caffeinated 
nutty, bitter, caffeinated    X  
 
If there are 640 plants in the F2 generation, give all the possible phenotypic classes you expect to see. 
Give the total number and the ratio of progeny in each phenotypic class. Note: Please ignore the traits 
that do not exhibit Mendelian inheritance.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 6  
In this exercise you will use StarGenetics, a software that simulates mating experiments to analyze the 
nature and mode of inheritance of specific genetic traits. To get to StarGenetics, please navigate to 
http://web.mit.edu/star/genetics. Click on the Start button to launch the application. Allow the 
application to run on the computer. Click on File -> New on the main menu. On the Welcome page, 
click on Fruit fly Exercise -3.  
 
You catch two fruit flies; one of these flies is male and the other is female.  Both flies have a very 
unusual phenotype: blue eyes and white body color. You put these flies in a vial and several days 
later, you return to find that this vial is full of blue-eyed, white-bodied flies!  The two flies that you 
caught have mated and it turns out that they are true breeding for the alleles that determine eye and 
body color!  You decide to find out if the genes that determine these two traits are linked or unlinked.  
When you come back to the lab, you discover that all of your blue-eye, white-body color flies have died 
except for one female.  You are determined to test for gene linkage, though.  To do so, you need to 
accomplish the following two tasks: 
 
•  First, you need to generate more blue-eye, white-body color flies by designing mating experiments using 
your one remaining blue-eye, white-body color female and a common laboratory fruit fly stock with a well 
characterized genetic background.   
•  Following this, you can perform mating experiment to determine if the two genes that determine the 
traits of interest are linked. 
 
a) Give the phenotype of the two flies in the “strains window” available for your initial mating 
experiment. Note: Click on each fly to view its phenotype. 
 
Male Fly:  
 
 
 
 
Female fly: 
	  b) To generate more flies with blue eyes and white body color, you set up a mating experiment 
between the two available flies. Note: You can set up a mating experiment by dragging the chosen parent flies 
to the Mating site and then clicking on the “MATE” button. Mating results are summarized in the 
“SUMMARY”. You can view the phenotypes by clicking the “SUMMARY->SHOW TAB” tab.  
 
i.  Describe the different phenotype(s) that you observe among the 50 F1 progeny and indicate 
how many of each type you observe.

c) Indicate genotypes for the following flies. Note: Use letters B and b for the alleles that regulate body color.  
Use letters E and e for the alleles that regulate eye color. For each gene, use the uppercase letter to represent the 
allele associated with the dominant phenotype and the lowercase letter to represent the allele associated with the 
recessive phenotype.

d) Design a mating experiment that would enable you to confirm your answer to part b (iii).  Indicate 
genotypes and phenotypes of the flies that you will mate.  Diagram the mating experiment and predict 
the genotypes and phenotypes of the resulting progeny.  Note:  This part of the question is optional 
and will not be graded. You can choose and drag the fly from your experiment to the “MATING SITE”. Click 
on “SAVE EXPERIMENT”. To start a new mating experiment click on the “NEW EXPERIMENT” button 
and then click on the “MATE” button as described earlier.
