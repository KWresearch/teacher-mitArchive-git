Question 1 
The following human pedigree shows the inheritance of a specific disease. Please note: The filled squares 
or circles represent the abnormal phenotype. The individuals marrying into the family do not have the disease- 
associated allele. Assume that no other mutation arises within the pedigree. Also assume complete penetrance.  
 
 
Use the symbol XD, Xd, D or d where appropriate. 
In each case, use the letter “D” to represent the 
 
allele associated with the dominant phenotype 
  
and ‘d” to represent the allele associated with the 
  
recessive phenotype.

b) Write all possible genotypes of the following individuals in the pedigree.  
#6: XDXd 
#19: XDXD 

   
  
 
c) What is the probability of Individual #21 being affected?  
Individual 12 has the genotype XDXd  whereas the genotype of individual 11 is XDY. So their son, individual 21 
has a 50% chance of being affected. 
 
d) The disease shown by the pedigree above is caused by a mutation in Gene D that encodes Protein D. 
You identify a SNP that is tightly linked to Gene D and may be used as a marker for the disease. The 
alleles (A, G, T, C) of this SNP for some individuals are given in the pedigree above. 
  
Identify the SNP(s) that is/are tightly linked with the mutant allele of Gene D. 
i. 
There are two SNPs in this pedigree that are linked to the mutant allele of Gene D i.e. “G SNP” from individual 2 
and “C SNP” from individual 4. 
 
ii.  Write the SNP genotypes of the following individuals. 
 
#5: G 
#14: C 
 
 
 
e) One can use the SNP microarrays to determine the SNP genotype of an individual. Briefly describe 
how the SNP microarrays work. 
DNA microarrays are small, solid supports onto which the oligonucleotides that represent the known SNPs in 
human genome are immobilized, or attached, at fixed locations. The supports themselves are usually glass 
microscope slides, but can also be silicon chips or nylon membranes. The DNA is printed, spotted, or actually 
synthesized directly onto the solid support. On the micro arrays the fluorescent- tagged genomic sample of 
interest in layered and allowed to hybridize with the oligonucleotides that have complementary sequence. The 
arrays are read through a laser detector to identify the SNP genotype of the individual test sample.

Question 1 continued 
f) Although SNPs can be in the coding, non-coding or intergenic (regions between two genes) of the 
genes, you observe that this SNP is located within the noncoding region of Gene D. However, it still 
changes the sequence of the protein encoded by Gene D.  Provide an explanation that supports this 
observation. 
Most likely, this SNP changes either the splice donor or splice acceptor sites as a result of which the intron is not 
spliced out. Hence the amino acid sequence of the resulting protein is much longer than the normal variant of this 
protein. 
 
g) You purify the wild- type and disease- associated forms of Protein D and determine their amino acid 
sequence. The only difference you find is at the 6th position shown in bold below.  
 
Wild- type variant:   N-gly5-trp6-ala7-C 
              
Mutant variant:  
N-gly5-ser6-ala7-C  
 
Shown below is a portion of the fluorescence dideoxy- sequencing gel, which gives the sequence of the 
non- template/ mRNA like strand of the DNA that corresponds to amino acids 5-7 of the mutant form 
of Protein D.

Write the sequence of the double stranded DNA that corresponds to amino acids 5-7 of the wild-type 
form of Protein D  and label its 5’ and 3’ ends. Note: A codon chart is provided on the last page of the 
problem set.

h) The following is the DNA sequence of the wild type allele of Gene D that you want to amplify 
using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

If  you  amplify  a  DNA  sequence  through  PCR,  what  are  the  reaction  components  that  you 
i. 
would absolutely need? Briefly state the function of each of these components. 
You  would  need  the  thermostable  Taq  DNA  polymerase,  which  can  catalyze  the  DNA  polymerization  reaction 
and add the dNTPs to the 3’end of the primers, which anneal with the complementary bases in the template DNA 
strands. You should also have the pair of primers and dNTPs for reasons described above. 
 
ii.  Give  the  sequence  (10  bases  long)  of  a  set  of  primers,  which  you  would  use  for  the  PCR 
reaction.  5’CTCGAGGTGAATAT3’  (as  primer  that  binds  5’->3  ’to  the  bottom  strand)  and 
5'TATCGATTACGCAAAT3'(as primer that binds 5’->3’to the top strand). 
In  the PCR  reaction, you need a  three-  step  reaction cycle, which  results  in a chain  reaction  that 
produces  an  exponentially  growing  population  of  identical  DNA  molecules.  Each  step  of  a 
reaction cycle is performed at a specific temperature i.e. 94oC for Step 1, 60oC for step 2 and 72oC 
for Step 3.  Briefly explain why the three steps are performed under different temperatures. 
At  95oC  the  two  strands  of  the  DNA  duplex  unwind  and  separate  from  each  other.  DNA  template  melts  or 
becomes  single-stranded  (denaturation).  At  55oC  the  primers  anneal  to  the  template  i.e.  they  undergo 
complementary  base  pairing  with  the  respective  template  strands  of  the  DNA  (annealing).  At  70oC  the  primers 
are extended by Taq DNA polymerase in the 5’ to 3’ direction (elongation).

iv.  When  PCR  amplification  is  used  to  provide  a  specific DNA  fragment  for  cloning,  the  resulting 
clones  are  sequenced  to  make  sure  that  inserts  have  the  correct  base  sequence.  What  activity 
does  Taq  DNA  polymerase  enzyme  lack  that  may  explain  the  errors  that  occur  during  PCR 
amplification? 
Taq DNA polymerase lacks the 3’→5’ exonuclease activity and can therefore not proofread the newly synthesized 
DNA strand for any incorrectly incorporated nucleotide base. 
 
Question 2 
You need a large amount of Protein D encoded by Gene D. Therefore you decide to engineer a mouse 
cell line that will secrete a large amount of Protein D, so that you can purify Protein D from the 
medium. Note:  A cell line is a single type of cell, which continuously grows in culture. 
 
a) List any four components, of the host eukaryotic cell translation machinery, which are absolutely 
required for synthesis of proteins, and briefly (few words) indicate what each does. 
Many answers can be accepted here including:  Ribosomes, amino acids, tRNAs, mRNA template. 
 
Ribosomes: They serve as the machinery for protein synthesis. They bind onto the ribosome-binding site (RBS) 
of the mRNA template and start moving along the length of mRNA template looking for the start codon 
(5’AUG3’), which defines the reading frame of the mRNA. From here on the tRNA, each charged with a specific 
amino acid binds to the codons of the mRNA template and also to the ribosomes and starts adding the amino 
acid to the growing peptide chain. The process continued till the translation machinery reaches the stop codon, at 
which point it falls apart and the newly synthesized protein is released.  
 
	  
b) List two components, of the host eukaryotic cell translation machinery, which are absolutely 
required for export of Protein D from the cell?  
Many	  answers	  can	  be	  accepted	  here	  including:	  Signal	  recognition	  peptide	  (SRP),	  SRP	  receptor	  on	  Endoplasmic	  
reticulum	  (ER),	  translocon,	  ER,	  golgi,	  ribosomes,	  vesicles,	  etc.
 
c) You isolate a cDNA for Gene D. However, when you transfect the normal cell line with a vector 
containing Gene D (i.e. insert a vector containing Gene D int
o the cells), you find that Protein D is 
produced in the cytoplasm but not secreted. You conclude that something is therefore wrong with the 
Gene D. 
 
i.  What modifications would you make to the cDNA for Gene D that would plausibly allow 
Protein D to be secreted?  
Include	  DNA	  that	  encodes	  a	  signal	  sequence	  near	  the	  3’	  end	  of	  the	  template	  DNA	  strand	  that,	  when	  
transcribed,	  will	  be	  on	  the	  5'	  end	  of	  the	  mRNA	  and	  ultimately	  on	  the	  N-­terminus	  of	  the	  translated	  protein.	  This	  
signal	  sequence	  will	  allow	  the	  protein	  to	  bind	  to	  the	  SRP.	  At	  this	  point	  the	  protein	  synthesis	  will	  temporarily	  
halt.	  The	  signal	  sequence	  –SRP	  complex	  will	  then	  be	  recognized	  by	  the	  SRP	  receptor/translocon.	  The	  signal	  
sequence	  –SRP	  complex	  will	  then	  pass	  through	  the	  SRP	  receptor	  to	  reach	  the	  ER	  lumen.	  The	  SRP	  will	  then	  
detach	  and	  the	  signal	  sequence	  will	  be	  cleaved	  and	  protein	  synthesis	  will	  resume.	  Once	  synthesized	  in	  the	  ER	  
lumen,	  the	  protein	  will	  be	  packaged	  in	  vesicles	  that	  will	  be	  transported	  to	  golgi	  for	  further	  modifications	  
(adding	  carbohydrates,	  lipids	  or	  phosphate	  groups)	  and	  then	  to	  the	  cell	  membrane.	  The	  vesicles	  will	  then	  fuse	  
with	  the	  plasma	  membrane	  and	  protein	  inside	  them	  will	  be	  secreted	  in	  the	  surrounding	  environment.	  
 
The following is a schematic of the cDNA for Gene D. Circle the region in Gene D, where you

Question 2 continued 
iii.  Assuming your manipulation in part (i) is successful, would the modified/secreted version of 
Protein D be of the same size, larger than, smaller than its unmodified/cytoplasmic version?  
Explain your answer. 
The	  nascent/	  primary	  protein	  made	  from	  the	  modified	  gene	  would	  be	  longer	  by	  the	  amount	  of	  the	  signal	  
sequence.	  However,	  signal	  sequences	  are	  removed	  in	  the	  ER	  so	  the	  secreted	  version	  of	  the	  protein	  would	  be	  the	  
same.	  
 
d) Interestingly, you find that this protein, when secreted, can bind to either of following cell 
membrane receptors (Receptor 1 and Receptor 2). The transmembrane domains (TD) and the signal 
sequence (SS) are shown in the schematic. 

 

 
Draw the two receptors as they would be inserted into the Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma 
membrane, label the N and the C termini and include all the TD domains that are shown in the 
schematic above.

Question 3 
You have identified an enzyme  (E1) in a yeast strain (Strain 1) that catalyzes a step in a biochemical 
pathway, which results in the synthesis of the amino acid Arginine. This enzyme is encoded by Gene 
A. You isolate Gene A from the yeast cells, clone it into a plasmid vector and amplify it in the bacterial 
cells.  
a) List the minimum features that a plasmid vector must have to allow the cloning and amplification of 
Gene A in bacterial cells. 
Origin site (Ori site) for replication, a site that can serve as the recognition sequence for restriction 
enzyme so that the plasmid can be cut open and used as a vector to clone the desired sequence and a reporter 
gene (i.e. antibiotic resistant gene) that can be used to differentiate between the untransformed host cells and the 
host cells that obtained a plasmid.

ii.  Which strategies  (Choose from Strategy 1, 2, 3) would allow a directional cloning? 2 & 3 
 
c) You then transform the bacterial cells with the ligation mix. 
Briefly outline a procedure that would allow you to distinguish the transformed bacterial cells 
i. 
from the untransformed ones. 
You plate the ligation mix on a master plate that has no ampicillin and let the bacterial cells form colonies. ALL 
bacterial cells, both transformed and untransformed will grow and form colonies on the master plate. Then you 
replica- plate these bacterial colonies on a plate that contains ampicillin. Only the bacterial cells that have been 
transformed with the plasmids will survive and form colonies since they will have the ampR gene and can make 
the enzyme that can degrade ampicillin. In comparison, the untransformed cells in the absence of this enzyme will 
not survive and hence will NOT form any colonies following replica plating. 
 
ii. 
Briefly outline how the DNA gel electrophoresis would allow you to distinguish between the 
bacterial cells transformed with the self- ligated plasmid from those transformed with the 
recombinant plasmid. 
You will isolate the plasmids from the bacterial colonies. The self- ligated plasmid (4 kb) and the recombinant 
plasmid with cloned Gene A (5kb) will be of different sizes and hence they will resolve differently when subjected 
to DNA gel electrophoresis.

Question 3 continued 
d) You grow and amplify the recombinant plasmid in the bacterial cells. You then purify the 
recombinant plasmid from the bacterial cells and transform the yeast cells with it.   
 
i.  Why did you use the bacterial cells only for the amplification of the plasmid but NOT for the 
expression of Gene A?  
Bacteria, being prokaryotes will not be able to splice out the introns and make a functional protein. You can also 
argue that if this eukaryotic protein requires further post-translational modifications the bacterial cells may not be 
able to do so i.e. the process is different in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. 
 
ii.  Give an alteration in your experiment that would have allowed you to both amplify and 
express Gene A in the bacterial cells.  
Instead of cloning Gene A, you may clone the cDNA corresponding to Gene A. The cDNA will be made by using 
mature mRNA corresponding to Gene A and therefore will have ONLY exons but NO introns and NO 
regulatory region. So as long as the cDNA is inserting in the plasmid in the correct orientation with respect to 
the promoter, the bacterial cells translation machinery can be used to translate it into the desired protein.  
 
iii.  What media would you use to select the yeast cells that are expressing the enzyme encoded by 
Gene A? 
You should plate the transformed yeast cells in the minimal media that lacks arginine (arg- plate). Only the cells 
that have been transformed with Gene A will be able to make the enzyme needed for Arg biosynthesis. These cells 
will form colonies on arg- plate. 
 
e) You friend also does the same experiment to clone Gene A with the following flanking sequence. But 
he decides to select the bacterial cells transformed with the recombinant plasmid using colony 
hybridization.

i.  Give the sequence of the probe that he would use for colony hybridization and label the 5’ and 
the 3’ ends. 
Your friend can either use 5’-CCCGTACTTGAAATC-3’, 5’ GGACTTACCATTGGG-3’, 
3’GGGCATGAACTTTAG5 or 3’-CCTGAATGGTAACCC-5’ sequence, radio label it and use it as a probe. 
 
ii. 
Briefly describe the major steps of colony hybridization that would allow your friend to select 
the transformed bacterial colony. 
You will take an imprint of the bacterial colonies on a nitrocellulose paper / nylon membrane and disrupt the cells 
leaving behind the genomic DNA on the nitrocellulose paper / nylon membrane. You will add the P32 labeled 
oligonucleotide probe onto the paper and let it hybridize with the complementary genomic DNA. You put an X 
ray film on the nitrocellulose paper and take an imprint of the bacterial colony that gets radiolabeled and hence 
lights up on the X ray film. This colony contains the plasmid that contains the gene of your interest. 
 
Question 4 
Individuals who are homozygous for the mutation in Gene A  (genotype = aa) suffer from a liver 
disease that shows an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. You decide to do a UROP in a lab that 
is dedicated to using gene therapy to cure this hereditary disorder, in a mouse model.  
 
a) Using virus as a vector that stably integrates into the genome of the host cell, you introduce a wild-
type allele of Gene A in the liver cells of newborn mice whose genotype is “aa”. If all cell types of the 
mouse have roughly the same genome why would you use only the liver cells to introduce the wild-
type allele of Gene A? 
Although ALL cells will have almost the same genome, different cell- types will express different sets of genes and 
hence will have different proteins. Gene A is expressed only in Liver cells and hence you use these cell-types in 
your experiment.

Question 4 continued 
b) Based on what you have learnt in 7.013 lectures why is the ex-vivo gene therapy more successful 
than the in- vivo gene therapy? Give one reason. 
Ex-vivo gene therapy gives you the ability to introduce a gene and screen for the transfected cells prior to 
introducing them back into the patient. So it is generally more successful than in- vivo gene therapy. But still  
there are multiple issues: 
1. Efficiency of infection: The virus that carries the cDNA of the interest does not transfect sufficient number of 
cells to improve the symptoms of the disease. 
2. The cDNA even if introduced may not be efficiently expressed or may not stay expressed for a long time to 
provide relief from symptoms for a long time. 
3. The recipient immune system may elicit an immune response to the virus. Or the virus may itself prove toxic 
to the recipient. 
 
c) Your supervisor suggests that you use embryonic cells instead of liver cells for ex-vivo gene therapy. 
Explain what may be the potential advantage of using embryonic cells compared to the liver cells.  
(NOT GRADED) 
Embryonic cells are pluripotent and can therefore acquire different cell fates.  They can also serve as the precursor 
for the germ-line cells. If this is the case, then the defect can be cured not only in the individual produced from the 
developing embryo but also in his descendants. Also, since the embryonic cells are undifferentiated cells they may 
better adopt to expressing new proteins.  
 
d) You isolate embryonic cells from an affected mouse (genotype: aa) and infect them with a viral 
vector that has a wild- type allele of Gene A. You select the cells that have been infected with the virus 
containing the wild- type copy of Gene A and re-introduce them into the developing embryo of the 
affected mouse to obtain newborns. You trace the location and expression of Gene A in the newborn 
mice by adding a blue color dye that specifically binds to the protein encoded by Gene A. You obtain 
the following two sets of results. Note: You may assume that the level of expression of the Gene A correlates 
with the intensity of the blue color in the cells. In wild-type mice, the dye stains only the liver cells.   
 
•  Set 1:  When you add the dye you find that most of cells in the mouse, including the liver cells, turn blue.  
•  Set 2:  Based on the results of Set 1, you modify your viral vector that contains Gene A, reinsert it into the 
embryonic cells and obtain newborns by following the same steps that were described above. When you add 
the dye you find that only the liver cells turn blue and the color is of the same intensity as in the liver cells 
of wild-type mice.  In addition, these mice do not show the manifestations of the disease.  
 
How did you modify the viral vector so that the introduced Gene A was expressed only in the liver 
cells of newborns obtained in Set 2?  
The introduced gene in Set 1 is under the regulation of a generic promoter. In contrast, the introduced gene in Set 
2 is under the regulation of a tissue specific promoter. 
 
e) You isolate the cell from a developing embryo (at the blastula stage/ 8– cell stage) that is produced 
by the fusion of gametes from affected parents (genotype: aa).   You infect these cells with a modified 
vector from Set 2 that has a wild type copy of Gene A. You then select the cells that have undergone 
homologous recombination and now have a wild-type copy of Gene A. You re-introduce them into the 
developing embryo (genotype: aa) to obtain newborns.  (NOT GRADED) 
  
i.  Give all the possible genotypes of the newborn obtained from this strategy? Briefly explain why 
you selected this genotype. Note: Use the uppercase A to represent the allele responsible for the dominant 
phenotype and lowercase a to represent the allele responsible for the recessive phenotype. 
This strategy will produce a chimeric mouse. This mouse will have some cell- types that will be derived from the 
modified embryonic cells where one allele associated with the disease has been replaced by a wild- type copy of the 
Gene A through homologous recombination (genotype Aa). The same mouse will also have some other cell-types 
that are derived from the original embryonic cells  (genotype aa) that did not receive a wild-type copy of Gene A. 
So the genotype of this chimeric mouse will be Aa in some cell- types and aa in other cell-types based on the embryonic cell 
types from which they originated through cell divisions.

Question 4 continued 
ii.  You allow the newborn obtained from the strategy outlined above to mate with a wild- type 
female mouse (genotype: AA). Would you expect all the mice from this mating experiment to 
have a normal phenotype (Yes/ No)? Explain why you selected this option. 
The gametes derived from the mouse obtained by strategy 2 can either have “a” or “A’ genotypes. When they fus
e 
with the gametes of a wild- type female (genotype “A”) they will produce newborns that can either have AA or A
a 
genotype and will therefore be phenotypically normal.
