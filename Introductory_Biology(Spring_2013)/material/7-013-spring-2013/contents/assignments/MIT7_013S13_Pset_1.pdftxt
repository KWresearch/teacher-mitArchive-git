 7.013 Problem Set 1- 2013
 

 

 

  
Question 1
 
 
a) With the exception of germ cells, the nucleus of all somatic cells in your body carries two copies of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
each DNA segment or chromosome, which together make your genome. To fit the entire DNA into a 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tiny nucleus, the chromosomes are highly compacted through a variety of mechanisms. If however,
 
they were not compacted and you laid them out end to end, all of the chromosomes in all of your cells
 
 
 
 
would travel a great distance. 
 
 
 
  
 
Given your knowledge of the distance between base pairs in the Watson and Crick model of the DNA 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
double helix as well as the size (in base pairs) of the human genome and the number of cells in the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
human body, how many round trips from the Earth to the Sun would this length of DNA travel?  Show 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
your work. 
  
 
 
Note: You may assume that there are 5 x 1013 cells in the human body and that each cell has two full copies of the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
genome. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) Fill  in  all  the  boxes  below  to  explain  the  relationship  between  proteins  and  the  two major  classes  of

Process                                                   Process 
 
 
 
 
 
c) Approximately 98% of all biological macromolecules are made of six major elements; carbon (C),
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), sulphur (S) and phosphorous (P). 
 
i.  Which elements (C/ H/ O/ N/ S/ P) are present in all biological macromolecules? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
ii.  Which radioactive element (C/ H/ O/ N/ S/ P) may be used to detect only the proteins in a cell?

Question 5 continued
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d) You perform the coupled reactions in two separate test tubes (Tube 1 and Tube 2). Both these tubes
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
contain GTP, substrates S1 and S2, enzymes E1 and E2 and either Drug 1 or Drug 2 as described below. 
 
 
•	  Tube 1 contains Drug 1 that is a manufactured chemical and inhibits the hydrolysis of GTP but it does
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
not prevent the binding of GTP to the active site of E1. This drug has no effect on E2. Furthermore, you 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
observe that the effect of this drug is irreversible. 
 
In comparison, Tube 2 contains Drug 2 under appropriate reaction conditions.  This drug is found 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
naturally in a cell and it inhibits the binding of S1 to the active site of E2 but has no effect on E1. The
 
inhibitory effect of this drug can be reversed by the excess amount of S1.

Question 6
An eye lens is comprised of cells that are created when an eye is formed and are retained for its
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lifetime. These cells lack organelles and can be regarded as “sacs” that are filled with a loose uniform
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
arrangement of water-soluble structural proteins called crystallins. The uniform distribution of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
crystallins in a cell prevents light scattering, maintains lens transparency and allows us to see. With
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
age, the crystallins undergo different modifications that increase the opacity of a lens and may lead to
 
 
 
 
the onset of cataracts. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biologists are currently using computer-modeling programs to view the structure and function of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
various proteins in both normal and diseased states. For this problem you will use a computer to view
the structure of γ–crystallin. To begin, go to http://web.mit.edu/star/biochem, click on the “Start and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
allow the link to open.  You may have to install JAVA to open this program. This can be downloaded 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
free from the JAVA website. Click on “Samples-> Select from samples ->Amino acids/ Proteins 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
->1HK0 -> open”. You will see a schematic of γ- crystallin on the right and a menu on the left. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a) Does the current view of 1HK0 show a monomeric (single polypeptide chain) or multimeric (more that 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
one polypeptide chain) protein? 
 
 
 
 
b) What is the highest order of protein structure that you observe for 1HK0? Explain why you selected 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this level. Note: In the sequence window, click on “Structure-> Protein -> Quaternary”. Increase the “Size 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
slide bar” in the “Surfaces” window. Each polypeptide chain in this program is shown by a different color. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
c) The crystal structure of 1HK0 exhibits two homologous domains that are joined intra-molecularly by
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a six amino acid linker. What is the secondary structure of this amino acid linker (choose from helices, 
 
 
 
sheets and coils)? Note Click on “Reset - > Reset structure”. Then click on “Structure -> Protein-> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary”. Select helices, sheets and ribbons one at a time and look at the amino acid sequences that get
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
highlighted in the “sequence window”. For better reviewing of protein structure you can increase the “Size 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
slide bar” within in the “Secondary structure window”. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 
 
d) Open another protein structure by going to “Samples-> Select from samples ->Amino acids/ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Proteins ->1BLB -> open”. What is the overall difference between structure of 1HKO and 1BLB? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
e) Based on what you have learned from this exercise, hypothesize how the change in crystallin 
structure, as seen in 1BLB, may lead to the development of cataract.
