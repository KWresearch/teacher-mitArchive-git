Solution key- 7.013 Problem Set 7 - 2013 
 Question 1 
a) Neuronal path finding is crucial for structured cellular organization and development of neural 
circuits. The elongation or retraction of the growth cone is dependent on the guidance cues. You are 
looking at the response of the growth cone to the following guidance cues. Note: In this example you may 
assume that both these guidance cues serve as attractants. 
 
•  Guidance cue 1: Fibronectin protein that is a part of ECM. 
 
•  Guidance cue 2: Ephrins, which diffuse along their concentration gradient. 
 
i.  Classify the two guidance cues as short- or long- range signals. 
 
Fibronectin:   Short Range 
 
 
 Ephrins: Long- Range 
 
 
ii. 
You do a stripe assay to determine if fibronectin serves as attractive guidance cues. Briefly 
explain how this assay works. 
You add fibronectin on one side of a strip and see the response of growth cone to this cue. If the cue is an 
attractant the growth cone will grow towards higher concentration gradient but if it is a repellant the growth 
cone will retract and the axon will not grow on the stripe. You should compared your results with the results of 
the control strip that shows how the neurons behave in the absence of any guidance cue. 
 
iii. 
The stripe assay is an in vitro assay, that is, performed outside the body. You next need to 
determine whether fibronectin and ephrins are the normal guidance cue for these neurons in 
the brain. Give an experiment that can help you answer this question. 
You can make null mutants that do not have the receptors for the specific guidance cues and compare their 
response to fibronectin and / or ephrins with that observed in normal situation.  You can also make  null mutants 
that do not make fibronectin and / or ephrins and compare their response to that observed in normal situation. 
 
b) A key question in neurobiology is how neurons find their targets to generate circuits. Retinal 
neurons transmit information about the light that the eye perceives to the brain in the form of electrical 
signals. The cell bodies of these neurons are in the eye. During development they connect to a region of 
the brain known as the optic tectum. The goal of recent research has been to figure out how they do 
this. The following inhibitors disrupt innervation of the tectum by retinal neurons. Complete the table 
for each of the following treatments. 
 
Treatments 
What would be the effect of this treatment on axon elongation? 
 
Nocodazole (disrupts 
Microtubules are part of the cytoskeleton. Microtubules take part in many other 
microtubules) 
processes: they are capable of growing and shrinking in order to generate force. 
In addition, organelles move along the microtubules to transport materials 
along the axon from the cell body to the terminal. Nocodazole would prevent 
axon elongation and thus prevent the neuron from reaching its target. Because 
microtubules are found in the central part of the growth cone, nocodazole could 
also prevent growth cone function. 
 
The extracellular matrix is essential for the positional cues needed for axonal 
guidance. If the ECM is disrupted, the positional cues will be disorganized.

Question 1 continued 
c) Ephrin is a ligand found in the optic tectum in a gradient, with more caudally (C), than rostrally (R). 
Temporally located retinal neurons (T) normally grow to the caudal tectum, as depicted below. When 
ephrin concentration is high throughout the tectum, retinal neurons stop in the rostral region (R). 
However, when ephrin concentration is low throughout the tectum, temporal retinal neurons grow 
past the tectum.

i.    What part of the neuron grows, as neurons find    
 
their path? 
       Growth cone or axon tip 

ii.   The receptor that binds ephrin is the Eph 
 
receptor. Where is the Eph receptor most likely 
 
to be expressed in the schematic above? 
    Receptor will be at the growing end on the retinal axon, 
R 
 the growth cone of the retinal axon. 
or
 
 
iii.   Using the data in the schematic, explain why 
 
during normal development, the temporal 
retinal neurons grow to the caudal tectum. 
 

T 

 
 
 
 
 
 
The data show that high levels of ephrin across the tectum cause the retinal neurons to stop rostrally, whereas low 
 
levels of ephrin across the tectum allow the retinal neurons to grow beyond the tectum. This indicates the a high 
concentration of ephrin is what signals the retinal neurons to stop, and this concentration is usually only 
present in the caudal tectum. 
 
iv.  What would happen to the growth of retinal neurons in the absence of the Eph receptor? 
Explain. 
The retinal neurons would not be able to detect the positional cues, and would thus have an abnormal trajectory 
i.e. the axons will grow past the tectum. 
Question 2  
Cancer is caused by accumulation of two or more mutations in the same cell that affects its proliferation 
and survival. 
 
a) Why does a person’s chance of having cancer increases with age? 
Cancer is a multi- step process that involves accumulation of many mutations in both tumor suppressor genes 
and oncogenes in the same cell. These mutations accumulate throughout the life of a cell, either spontaneously 
or by exposure to carcinogens, by replication mistakes or by chromosomal translocations. Since the chances of 
accumulation of these mutations increase over time, the chances of an individual having cancer also increases 
with age. 
 
b) Why is cancer mostly considered a genetic disease of somatic cells? 
Cancer is caused by the accumulation of a set of mutations in a single somatic cell, either primarily due to 
exposure to carcinogens or as replication mistakes. As a side-note, gametes and gamete producing cells are well 
protected and have a limited number of cell divisions, so they are not readily mutated.

Question 2 continued 
c) The Ames test is very often used to evaluate the mutagenic potential of a chemical agent. The test 
employs a strain of bacteria that have mutation in a gene(s) that codes for an enzyme(s), which is 
involved in the synthesis of the amino acid histidine. These bacterial strains are therefore His–  (cannot 
synthesize histidine) and they grow only in the growth medium that contains histidine.  However, a 
compensatory mutation to this gene(s) may cause the His- bacterial strain to revert to a His+ strain that 
can grow in the medium that lacks histidine. 
 
You want to test the mutagenic potential of benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) found in cigarettes smoke. You 
want to perform the following experiments using this carcinogen. 
 
•  Experiment 1: You incubate the His- bacterial cells with B(a)P  and plate them on cell culture plates with 
media that lack histidine.  After incubating the plate overnight at 37oC, you observe that the number of 
colonies on this plate is almost equal to those on a control plate that contains bacterial cells not incubated 
with B(a)P.  
 
•  Experiment 2: You inject B(a)P in  mice every alternative day for one month. You carefully observe these 
mice overtime and see that that they develop a solid tumor.  
•  Experiment 3: You first incubate B(a)P with liver extract that contains metabolic  and detoxifying enzymes  
and then add the His- bacterial cells to the incubation mix. You plate the bacterial cells on cell culture 
plates with media that lack histidine and incubate them overnight for 24 hrs at 37oC. You find that that 
the number of His+ colonies appearing on this plate is 500 fold more compared to that observed in 
experiment 1. 
 
Circle the option from the choices below that best characterizes B(a)P and explain why you selected 
this option. 
 
 
Carcinogen but not a mutagen  
Mutagen     
 
Promutagen 
B (a)P is a promutagen, which is not cancer causing in its native form. However, as shown by Experiment 2 and 
Experiment 3, the metabolic enzymes present in the liver extract and different tissues of the experimental mice 
convert the B(a)P from its pro-mutagenic form into a metabolic form(s) that is mutagenic. Hence you see the 
development of solid tumor in experimental mice and reversion of His- bacterial cells to His+ bacterial cells in 
Experiment 3, which form colonies on the plate that has a selection growth media that lacks histidine. 
 
d) The following are three bacterial mutants that have different mutations in the DNA sequence that 
encodes the C-terminus of an enzyme (200 amino acids long) that is required for Histidine biosynthesis 
and that requires Gln197 for its function.  The DNA sequence corresponding to the last five amino acids 
of the wild- type and three different mutant versions (1/ 2/ 3) of this enzyme is included within the 
sequence below. Please Note: A codon chart is provided on the last page of this problem set.

Question 2 continued 
You treat mutants 1, 2 & 3 separately with two mutagens; mutagen C causes point mutations in 
comparison to mutagen D that results in frame-shift mutations.  
i.  Which bacterial mutant (choose from 1, 2 or 3) can revert to wild- type following the treatment 
with mutagen C? Explain why you selected this option. 
Mutant #1, shows a point mutation that results in a missense mutation i.e. - 5’-CAA-3’ (encoding Glu197) is 
changed to 5’-CGA-3’ (encoding Arg197).   Mutagen C can revert this point mutation.  
 

ii.  Which bacterial mutant (choose from 1, 2 or 3) can revert to wild- type following the treatment 
with mutagen D? Explain why you selected this option. 
  Mutant #3, shows a point mutation (deletion) that results in a frameshift altering the last five amino acids of 
enzyme E1. Mutagen D causes insertions that can correct the reading frame. 
 
e) Although most carcinogens are mutagenic there are examples of some non- mutagenic carcinogens. 
Alcohol is one such example and excess consumption of alcohol is very often related to liver cancer. 
Give one mechanism by which a non-mutagenic carcinogen such as alcohol can cause cancer. 
Excess consumption of alcohol results in liver damage. In order to repair this damage, the remaining cells in the 
liver undergo increased cell proliferation, which if pushed too much results in accumulation of mutations that 
ultimately result in cancer. 
 
Question 3 
a) Many of the mutations that cause cancer involve oncogenes, whereas others involve tumor 
suppressor genes. Suppose that you had the ability to introduce the wild- type copy of a gene into a 
transformed cell. 
 
i.  If the cell is transformed due to mutation of a tumor suppressor gene, would you expect that 
adding the wild- type copy of the mutated gene would restore the cell’s the wild- type 
phenotype (Yes/ No)? Explain your choice. 
Yes, Mutations in tumor suppressor genes involve a loss of both of the alleles of the gene. Hence introduction 
of a normal copy of the mutated gene could restore the cell’s normal phenotype. 
ii.  If the cell is transformed due to an oncogenic mutation, would you expect that adding the wild- 
type copy of the mutated gene would restore the cell’s wild- type phenotype (Yes/ No)? Explain 
your choice. 
No,  Oncogenic  mutations  involve  a  gain  of  function  of  one  of  two  alleles  of  the  same  gene,  and  create  a 
transformed  phenotype  that  is  dominant. Hence  introduction  of  a  normal  copy  of  the  gene would  not  restore  the 
cell’s normal phenotype. 
b) Cancer is caused by accumulation of mutations in the same cell that affect its proliferation and 
survival. In the table below, you introduce a single copy of the mutant gene into an immortalized cell 
line. For each gene, state the phenotype of the cell that has received a single copy of the mutant gene by choosing 
from transformed (characteristics of cancer cells) or untransformed (characteristics of wild-type cells) 
phenotype. Consider introduction of each gene separately.

Question 3 continued 
c) MSH2 is a gene commonly associated with familial nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. This gene 
encodes a protein that is involved in correcting the mismatched nucleotides. Briefly explain why the 
individuals who are heterozygous for the loss-of- function mutation of MSH2 gene (MSH2+/MSH2-) 
from birth are very likely to develop colon cancer very early in their lives. 
All the cell types in this individual, right from birth, only have one functional copy of the MSH2 gene including 
the cells that make the colon (Genotype: (MSH2+/MSH2-). There is >90%  probability that one of these cells will 
show a loss-of- heterozygosity  (LOH) and acquire a genotype MSH2-/MSH2- . This cell will not be able to repair 
any DNA damage and hence will get transformed over time.  The uncontrolled proliferation of this cell along with 
the accumulation of mutations will ultimately lead to the development of colon cancer. 
 
d) The following pedigree represents the inheritance of predisposition to colon cancer that is caused 
by a mutation in the MSH2 gene. Give the most likely inherited genotype at the MSH2 locus for each 
of the following individuals.  Please Note: Use MSH2+ for the wild-type allele and MSH2- for the mutant 
allele. You may ignore the SNP information for this part of the question. Also note that people marrying into the 
family  only have wild- type copies of MSH2 gene.

e) You continue to study this family and are surprised when individual 5 has a child that develops 
colon cancer at an early age.  You analyze a tightly linked SNP marker for the members of this family.  
The alleles of SNP for each individual are shown in the pedigree.  
 
i.  Assuming no recombination between SNP and the MSH2 locus, what allele of SNP is linked to 
the “MSH2” allele in individual 1? T allele 
ii.  Assuming no recombination between SNP and the MSH2 loci, how can you explain the 
phenotype of individual 5? 
He did not get the 2nd mutation that would have converted MSH+ allele to MSH- allele resulting in a loss of 
heterozygosity. But this individual is still an obligate carrier and pass on the mutant allele to the next generation. 
 
Question 4 
a) p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in 50% of the cancers including cervical cancer. 
 
i.  The Human papilloma virus  (HPV) has been  implicated  as  a  risk  factor  for  cervical  cancer. The 
E6  protein  of  HPV  binds  to  and  inactivates  p53.    Explain  why  the  virally  encoded  E6  protein 
can result in cells that form a tumor. 
p53 is a tumor suppressor gene product that inhibits cell division when active. Since E6 protein of HPV 
inactivates p53, it is no longer capable of inhibiting cell division. Hence, the cells carrying mutations will go 
through uncontrolled cell proliferation resulting in the formation of tumor.

Question 4 continued 
ii.  It is possible to create a knock out mouse model where both the alleles of p53 gene are deleted 
(p53-/p53-). Such mice can survive for 4-6 months but are highly prone to developing cancer. 
Would you predict that a tumor composed of cells that are p53-/p53-  (a tumor suppressor 
gene) would be more or less sensitive to radiation than a tumor that is p53+/p53-? Explain 
your answer. 
p53 is a protein that is activated in response to DNA damage. Once activated it can initiate the apoptosis 
pathway. A tumor composed of cells that are p53-/p53- would be less sensitive to DNA damage because it cannot 
activate the apoptosis pathway, whereas a cell that is p53+/p53- can partially activate the apoptosis pathway and 
those cells will die as a result of treatment. 
 
b) Gardasil represents a growing number of immunotherapies that may be employed to effectively 
treat specific types of cancers with minimal side effects. The major capsid protein of HPV can 
spontaneously assemble to form virus like particles (VLPs) that resemble HPV virions. Gardasil 
contains recombinant VLPs. These VLPs can induce an immunological response that prevents HPV 
infection but they do not cause cancer.Explain why Gardasil can induce an immune response in an 
individual. 
Since Gardasil contains the antigens of HPV, it can mount a humoral immune response. 
 
c) Radiation and chemotherapy are very often used individually or in combination to treat different 
types of cancers.  
 
i.  Both radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs often have side effects such as diarrhea, constipation, 
mouth sores, hair loss, nausea, and blood-related side effects. Explain why the side effects are 
the same for radiation and a variety of different drugs. 
Most of these chemotherapeutic agents target the cancer cells since they are actively dividing cells compared to the 
normal cells. However, normal cells that are actively dividing, such as hair cells, blood cells and gut cells, are also 
targeted by these treatments resulting in hair loss and nausea. Therefore, they all result in very similar side-
effects. 
 
ii.  Prior to being used for treatment, each chemotherapeutic drug is extensively screened. During 
drug screening you identify two compounds A and B that have the potential to kill cancer cells 
and normal cells as shown by the following graph. Which compound (choose from compound A or 
compound B) is a better candidate for cancer treatment? Explain why you selected this option.

Compound concentration  
 
Compound A will be a better choice since it has a larger therapeutic index i.e. The effective concentration of 
compound A that is required to kill the cancer cells is far less compared to the concentration needed to kill the 
normal cells. 
 
c) Vincristine (a microtubule inhibitor) is often used to treat different cancers. Briefly explain how 
vincristine can help to treat   a wide – variety of cancers. 
Vincrisine prevents the formation of mitotic spindle and hence inhibits cell proliferation.  
 
 
 
 
 

Question 5 
a) Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematological cancer of myeloid origin that occurs 
predominantly in adults.  Most of the CML patients show a chromosomal translocation that results in 
the formation of the Bcr-Abl fusion gene or Philadelphia Chromosome. This gene encodes for Bcr-Abl 
tyrosine kinase protein.   
 

i.  Consider a patient who has CML, and answer the following questions. 

•  Would the Philadelphia chromosomal translocation be present in all of the cells in the patient’s 
blood system? No, it is restricted to myeloid cells in the blood. 

•  How many independent times did the Philadelphia chromosomal translocation occur in the 
patient? Only once, and all the cancerous cells originated as the clones of this mutated cell.  

•  Could the patient pass CML onto his/her kids? Explain your choice. No, this mutation has 
occurred in somatic cells and not in the germline cells.  

 

 

 

 

 

•  Would all the cancer cells in this patient have the same gene expression profile (Yes/ No)? Explain 
your choice. Yes, within a specified time span all cancer cells are being produced from the clonal 
expansion of the transformed cell that was produced due to the Bcr-Abl chromosomal translocation. But 
over time the cancer cells will acquire further mutations resulting in the generation of new clones. 
ii.  CML patients are effectively treated with Gleevec, which inhibits Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity 
by binding to its ATP binding pocket. 
 
•  The CML patients relapse if they stop taking Gleevec. Explain why is this so. 
Gleevec binds to the ATP binding site of Bcr-Abl kinase thus preventing ATP from binding to it. If a patient 
stops taking Gleevec, then the Bcr-Abl kinase will bind to ATP and result in uncontrolled cell proliferation. 
 
•   CML patients over time generate Gleevec-resistant clones that have mutations in their kinase 
domain. Briefly explain how the mutations in the kinase domain of Bcr-Abl fusion gene results 
in Gleevec resistance. 
These mutations alter the kinase domain or ATP binding domain  of Bcr-Abl kinase preventing Gleevec from 
binding to it. 
 

•  The Gleevec resistant clones however respond to another drug, Spryzel. If the patients are given 
both Gleevec and Spryzel together at the beginning of treatment, the generation of drug-
resistant clones can be delayed. Explain why this may be so. 
Multiple separate mutations are far less likely to occur simultaneously than the single mutations needed to confer 
resistance to either drugs alone. 
 
c) Approximately 25-30% of women with breast cancer over-express Her-2 receptor proteins. If these 
patients are treated with Herceptin antibody, specific for Her-2 receptors, they Her-2 over-expressing 
breast cancer cells are specifically attacked by the patient’s own immune system. Additionally, these 
cells also show decreased proliferation. Explain how Herceptin mediates a dual effect. 
Some less aggressive forms of breast cancer are not associated with an overexpression of the Her2 gene, so they are 
not sensitive to Herceptin. Often the aggressive forms of breast cancers, are associated with an amplification of the 
Her 2 gene.  The amplification of the Her2 gene correlates with the increased expression of receptor on cell surface, 
which increases the proliferation signal that is critical for tumor development.  Herceptin is a monoclonal 
antibody that binds to the Her2 receptors that are expressed on the surface of cancerous cells thereby flagging 
these cells for destruction by the immune system. At the same time Herceptin blocks the dimerization of receptors 
(which is needed for their activation) the downstream signaling by the Her2 receptors thereby preventing tumor 
proliferation. It also promotes receptors internalization and their degradation or proteolysis.

Influenza virus is a single minus stranded, segmented, RNA virus that does not replicate via a DNA

a) Based on the details provided in the schematic is it more likely that this virus escapes its host cell via 
a mechanism involving cell lysis or budding? Explain.  
Budding: the presence of the lipid bilayer in the virion shows that this particle was derived from the host cell 
membrane. 
 
b) Influenza virus is unable to make more viral RNA within the host cells using exclusively the host cell 
proteins.  
 
i.  Explain why this is so.  
Its genome has the opposite polarity compared to the RNA of the host cell that it this virus infects. So this virus 
has to bring in its own RNA dependent RNA polymerase into the host cell at the time of infection which converts 
the minus RNA strand to + RNA strand that can then be recognized and translated by the host cell machinery. 
 
 
 
ii.  Explain how the virus overcomes this issue and replicates its genome in the host.  
It brings in its own RNA dependent RNA polymerase into the host cell at the time of infection. 
 
c) Explain why we need to develop a new vaccine against the flu virus almost each flu season. 
This is a segmented virus with multiple RNA strands. If two different viral strains (Strain A and Strain B) 
simultaneously infect a cell the progeny virus may have mixture of genome segments some coming from strain A 
and others from strain B. Hence they may have new antigens for which we need a new vaccine. Besides, the RNA 
dependent RNA polymerase has no proofreading activity thus increasing the frequency of mutation that 
leads to the production of new strains.

Question 6 continued 
d) You decide to generate a vaccine against Influenza virus that would elicit a humoral response. 
Which viral proteins are best candidates for designing vaccine? 
 
Proteins 
Good candidate 
Explain 
(Yes/No)? 
Hemagglutinin 
Hemagglutinin since they are localized on the surface and are 
Yes 
 
involved in binding of the virus to the receptors on target cells. 
So antibodies produced against these surface antigens will 
neutralize these antigens and prevent the virus from binding to 
the target cells 
No since these is not a part of the cell surface protein and will 
not be available to bind to the antibodies developed against them. 

No 

Matrix protein 
 
Nucleoproteins 
 
Neuraminidase 
 

Yes 

Neuraminidase since they are localized on the surface and are 
involved in the entry of the virus into the target cells. So 
antibodies produced against these surface antigens will prevent 
the virus to enter into the cells. 
 
 e) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus. Its genome is a single (+) stranded RNA that 
is packaged with the reverse transcriptase enzyme within a protein capsid. This is further packaged 
into an envelope that is derived from the plasma membrane of the host cell in which the virus had 
replicated. The surface of the envelope is covered with the envelope glycoprotein, called gp120.  
  
i.  HIV  specifically  infects  the T-  helper  (TH)  cells  of  the  human  immune  system.  If  the HIV  enters 
the  host  cell  by  means  of  host  receptor  recognizing  a  viral  protein,  what  would  be  the  most 
likely ligand and its corresponding receptor during HIV infection? 
The gp120 protein on the surface of HIV envelop binds to the CD4 receptor on the surface of T helper cells and 
this ligand-receptor binding event is the first step of infection. 
 
Some  individuals  are  resistant  to  HIV  infection  even  after  repeated  exposure.  Assuming  that 
ii. 
these  individuals  express  a  normal  level  of  the  functional  receptor  that  you  have  recognized 
above, how can you explain their resistance to HIV? 
The gp41 protein on the surface of virus binds to a chemokine receptor (CCR) on the surface of T helper cells. If a  
person shows a homozygous mutation for the CCR gene (CCR-/ CCR-) he/she will not have the chemokine  
receptor and will not contract AIDS even after repeated exposure to HIV.   
 

In  recent  years,  therapies  have  been  developed  to  fight  AIDS  using  nucleotide  analogs.  The 
drug  used  to  combat  AIDS  is  Azidothymine  (AZT).  The  structure  of  AZT  is  very  similar  to 
thymidine  except  that  in  AZT,  the  3’-OH  group  on  the  deoxyribose  sugar  is  replaced  by  an 
azido (N3) group. Which process of the life cycle of HIV do you think is inhibited by AZT?  
AZT is a thymidine analogue (a nucleotide used in the synthesis of DNA). Therefore AZT interferes with the 
synthesis of DNA from RNA by reverse transcriptase. This enzyme incorporates AZT more effectively into the 
growing DNA chain and this blocks the further elongation of the chain because the growing end has no 3’-OH 
group on the deoxyribose sugar. So the viral concentration decreases over time with response to the treatment.
