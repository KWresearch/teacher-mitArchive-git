Question 1
 
During a summer hike you suddenly spot a huge grizzly bear.  This emergency situation triggers a

Note:                    represents activation                                       represents repression. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Some major features of this pathway are outlined below: 
•	  The small molecule adrenaline binds to its β1-adrenergic membrane receptor. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following the binding to adrenaline, this receptor acts as a kinase and converts the inactive GDP bound G proteins
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
•	 
to the active GTP bound G proteins. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•	  The GTP bound G proteins activate the adenylyl cyclase enzyme. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•	  The GTP bound G proteins are inactivated by re-conversion to the GDP bound form. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•	  Adenylyl cyclase enzyme converts ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). 
 
 
 
 
 
•	  The cAMP binds and activates Protein Kinase A. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•	  This results in an increased heart rate and breakdown of fat to trigger the “Fight or Flight” response. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•	  The Protein Kinase A enzyme also activates BARK kinase. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•	  The activated BARK activates β-arrestin, which inhibits β1-adrenergic membrane receptor activity. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a) Name the 1st and the 2nd  ligand in this pathway and give one reason that explains why the 2nd 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
messenger may be important in this pathway.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adrenaline is the first ligand and the cAMP produced is the 2nd  ligand or 2nd  messenger. The 2nd  messenger is 
 
 
 
important since it is used for intracellular signaling or transferring the effect of other ligands such as adrenaline,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
which otherwise cannot enter the cell. It also shows a transient expression meaning it is available and functional
 
 
 
 
 
only for a short time following which it gets degraded by the phosphodiesterase. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b)  In order to further understand this cellular pathway you examine this pathway in a cell after the 
following perturbations.
 
  
Perturbation 1: Αpplication of cholera toxin, which prevents G proteins from hydrolyzing GTP to GDP. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Perturbation 2:  Treatment with nebivolol, a molecule that competes with adrenaline to bind to the β1-
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
adrenergic membrane receptor but does not stimulate the pathway. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In which of the two treatments will the adrenaline cause a constitutive (continual) activation of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.	 
 
adenylyl cyclase? Explain.
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment with cholera toxin will prevent the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. As a result the G proteins will remain
 
 
 
 
in their active (GTP bound) state and constitutively activate the downstream target; adenylate cyclase. 
 
 
 

 
1 

 

 
 
Question 1 continued
 
 
 
In which of the two treatments will you see very low or no activation of adenylyl cyclase in the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.	 
 
 
 
presence of adrenaline? Explain.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment with Nebivolol will result in no or little activation of adenylate cyclase since this inhibitor will
 
 
 
 
compete with adrenaline to bind to the β1- adrenergic receptor. 
 
c) Consider the following perturbations in different components of the above signaling pathway in a 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
cell. 
 
 
 
 
  
 
•  #1: BARK lacks its kinase domain. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  #2: β arrestin is constitutively (always) active. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  #3: β1-adrenergic membrane receptor lacks its ligand-binding domain. 
 
 
Complete the table for each of the following perturbations relative to unperturbed control cells in the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
presence of adrenaline. Note: Consider each perturbation independently while answering the questions.

Effect on heart rate and fat breakdown relative to 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
unperturbed control cells in the presence of
 
 
 
 
adrenaline (choose from increased, decreased or
 
 
 
unchanged)? Explain. 
 
 
 
Since mutant BARK is not activated by PKA, it will not
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
activate arrestin, which is required for the feedback 
inhibition of β- adrenergic receptor. Therefore there will
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be an increased heart rate and fat breakdown relative to 
 
 
 
unperturbed control cells. 
 
 
 
 
   
 
Mutant arrestin will have a constitutive feedback 
inhibitory effect on β- adrenergic receptor. Therefore there
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
will be no increase in the heart rate and fat breakdown 
 
 
 
 
relative to unperturbed control cells. 
 
Mutant β- adrenergic receptor will not bind to 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adrenaline. Accordingly, the pathway will not get
 
 
 
 
 
 
activated and there will be no increase in heart rate and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fat breakdown relative to unperturbed control cells. 

 

 
Question 2

 
The origin recognition complex (ORC) is a multi- subunit protein complex that binds to the ori site(s)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and serves as a platform for the assembly of kinases like Cdk6 and Cdt1.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the G1 phase of the cell cycle in yeast, ORC forms a pre- replication complex by recruiting Cdk6 and
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cdt1 that bind to both strands of DNA. These factors bind and inhibit the Mcm protein that functions as a
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
helicase as is shown in the schematic below. Note: The activation is shown by an →  and inhibition by ⊥ sign.

Question 2 continued
a) Activation of the pre-replication complex occurs during the S phase and this requires its interaction
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with Cdk2 and Cyclin E proteins that degrade Cdk6 and Cdt1. This results in the replication of DNA.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Draw a schematic, similar to the one on page 2, to show the regulatory interactions between ORC,
Cdk6, Cdt1, Mcm, Cdk2 and Cyclin E proteins.  Note: Please indicate the activation by an →  and inhibition 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by ⊥ sign.

Replication complex in S phase 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) In a cell showing a Cdk2 loss-of–function mutation, in which phase (choose from G1, S, G2, M, all or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
none) would the cell arrest?  Explain why you selected this option.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this mutant, since the Mcm protein is never activated the cell will not replicate its DNA and instead remain

 
 
 
 
 
arrested in the G1 phase. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) If the cdk-2 gene encodes Cdk-2 protein, in which phase (choose from G1, S, G2, M, all or none) will the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cdk-2 gene be expressed? Explain why you selected this option.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The cdk-2 gene will be expressed in all the phases of cell cycle but the synthesized Cdk-2 protein will be activated
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
only in G1/ S interphase by the Cyclin E protein. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d) If the cyclin E gene encodes Cyclin E protein, in which phase (choose from G1, S, G2, M or all) will the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cyclin E gene be optimally expressed? Explain why you selected this option.
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
Each cyclin shows a transient/ cyclic expression in a specific phase of cell cycle. Therefore, the cyclin-E gene will
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be expressed only in the G1/ S interphase where it encodes Cyclin E protein, which can bind to and activate Cdk6
 
protein. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
e) One method for studying the essential components that regulate different steps of the cell cycle
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
involves the use of conditional temperature-sensitive mutants. You isolate temperature-sensitive Cdk2
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
yeast mutants. These mutant cells grow normally at the permissive temperature (25°C). However these
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cells arrest at a specific point in the cell cycle when the temperature is shifted to 36°C (non-permissive
  
temperature). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Is the primary structure of the temperature-sensitive Cdk2 protein at 36°C same as or different 
i.	 
 
 
 
from that at 25°C?  The primary structure will be the same at both temperatures. 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Is the three- dimensional conformation of the temperature-sensitive Cdk-2 protein at 36°C same 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.	 
 
as or different from that at 25°C? Explain why you selected this option.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The three- dimensional structure of the protein that is predominantly stabilized by the non-covalent bonds be 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disrupted at higher temperature since these bonds are sensitive to temperature changes. 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
f) You grow the mutant cells, described in part (e), at 36°C or non- permissive temperature. 
 
 
i.  Predict the effect on G1 phase in the mutant cells grown at 36°C compared to those at 25°C. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The cells will arrest in the G1 phase. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.  Predict the effect on the S phase in the mutant cells at 36°C compared to those at 25°C. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The cells will arrest in the G1 phase.

Question 2 continued
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
g) You further create two mutant cells each having a mutation in Cdk-2 genes as described below. 
 
•  Mutant cell- type 1: The Cdk-2 protein lacks its kinase domain. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Mutant cell- type 2:  The Cdk-2 lacks its Cyclin E binding domain. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Predict what would happen to the cell cycle in… 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.  Mutant 1: The cells will arrest in the G1 phase. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.	  Mutant 2: The cells will arrest in the G1 phase. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
h) The proper development and functioning of different tissues and organs involves a tight regulation
  
 
 
 
 
of cell division and cell death. 
 
i.  A cell can die by “apoptosis”. What does this term mean? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Apoptosis refers to the programmed cell death 
 
 
ii.	  Apoptosis may occur either via extrinsic or intrinsic signaling pathways. Based on what you 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have learnt in 7.013, if a cell makes the decision to die when subjected to hypoxia (low oxygen 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concentration) would you regard this as an example of extrinsic or intrinsic signaling pathway? 
Explain why you selected this option.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This is an intrinsic pathway since the hypoxia condition is being sensed by the cell. Note: please take a look at 
 
Slide 26 of Cell Biology-III lecture. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iii.  Apoptosis involves the activation of Caspases. Briefly explain the function of these enzymes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
They act by causing the degradation of the proteins that ultimately results in DNA degradation. 
 
 
 
Question 3
 
Development of human and chicken hearts is thought to occur by very similar mechanisms. The heart
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
develops from a layer of cells called the “mesoderm”, which lies on top of another layer of cells called
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“endoderm”. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a) The mesoderm forms the heart, the kidney and the blood. 
 
i. What does the term “potency” mean? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
Potency refers to the number of fates a cell can acquire. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii. What term would describe the potency of the mesoderm (choose from totipotent, multipotent or 
 
 
 
 
 
unipotent)?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Since the mesoderm can produce heart, the kidney and the blood, it is multi-potent. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) You want to know when the future heart cells decide to become such. You isolate a small piece of
 
 
 
 
 
tissue (or explant), from the heart forming anterior mesoderm of a young embryo (stage 2), and also
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from a slightly older (stage 4) embryo (about 6 hours older than stage 2). You make sure to take the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
same relative region from both. You culture the tissues in tissue culture plates, examine them three
 
 
 
 
 
days later and tabulate your results below.

Question 3 continued
i.	  At the time of isolation, are the stage 2 cells determined, differentiated or undetermined 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compared to Stage 4 cells? Explain. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
They are undetermined since after 3 days of culture they still remain unchanged and do not differentiate into the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
beating heart (perhaps in the absence specific inducers) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.	  Are the beating heart cells determined, differentiated or neither compared to Stage 4 cells? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Explain. 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
They are defferentiated since they function as beating heart cells. 
 
c) You ask why the isolated Stage 2 cells did not become a heart when they were isolated. Since the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
anterior mesoderm cells lie on top of the “endoderm” layer, you therefore modify your experiment  as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
shown in the table below and obtain the following results.

that is unlabeled 
 
 
Endoderm alone that is unlabeled 
 
 
 
Same as original unlabeled
 
 
 
 
cells 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Why does the stage 2 anterior mesoderm explant when cultured with endoderm make a heart, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
whereas the stage 2 anterior mesoderm explant alone does not?
 
   
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Endoderm, most likely, secretes an inducer (or a signaling factor), which binds to a specific receptor located on the
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
surface of anterior mesoderm cells so that they become heart cells. 
 
d) You later observe that if Stage 2 cells are cultured for three days with a purified secreted protein,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BMP4, they develop and form a beating heart. Based on all the data above, where in the embryo (choose 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from mesoderm, endoderm or both) would you expect BMP4 to be expressed if it directs normal heart 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
formation? Explain why you selected this option.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BMP4 is most likely expressed and secreted by endodermal cells since it is inducing the heart. On the mesoderm
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
cells, it binds to a specific receptor so that they can transition into a beating heart. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
e) Posterior mesoderm does not form the heart. To test whether BMP4 is able to turn posterior
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mesoderm into beating heart you culture the cells of the posterior mesoderm in the presence and
 
 
 
 
 
 
absence of BMP4 and obtain the following results. 
 
Explant 
 
 
Stage 2 posterior mesoderm explant 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stage 2 posterior mesoderm explant  + BMP4 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
You know that BMP4 is a secreted protein that activates its receptor via phosphorylation. The activated receptor
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phosphorylates a transcription factor, Smad1. Phospho-Smad1 moves to the nucleus to change transcription of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
target genes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Using the above information, suggest why posterior mesoderm does not respond to BMP4.
 
 
 
 
 
 
The posterior mesoderm either lacks the receptor specific for BMP4 or the transcription factor Smad1. Therefore
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
BMP4 has no effect on posterior mesoderm.

f) Anterior mesoderm cultured with BMP4 alone develops into a heart, while anterior mesoderm
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treated with BMP and fibroblast growth factor (FGF, another signaling protein) develops into kidney.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You examine the combinatorial code required to determine heart or kidney, using tissue from these

ii. Give a possible role of Gene A in heart and kidney formation?
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It encodes a regulatory protein that is ubiquitously involved in the formation of both heart and kidney cells i.e. it
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
regulates a protein whose function is common to both cell types. 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iii. What role might Gene B play in heart and kidney formation?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
It encodes a protein that most likely functions as an inhibitor for heart and kidney formation. Alternatively, this
 
 
 
 
protein may keep the cells undetermined. 
 
  
Question 4
 
 
Kidney is an organ that is comprised of 10 different cell types and has a specific 3- dimensional
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
structure. Its formation involves the reciprocal interactions between the nephric duct (a tube) and the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
metanephric mesenchyme. First, the metanephric mesenchyme induces the duct to form a new tube
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
called the ureteric bud. The ureteric bud induces the metanephric mesenchyme, which then forms the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
glomerulus, the principal filtration region of the kidney.

Question 4 continued
a) Briefly explain what is reciprocal induction and explain how it relates to the kidney development?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reciprocal induction is differing tissues causing changes in each other due to signals and receptors in each. The
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reciprocal induction between the metanephric mesenchyme and duct is critical for the formation of glomerulus
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(the principal filtration region) and ureteric bud that are the key elements of the urinary system. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) Formation of the ureteric bud, a tube, requires branching and lengthening of the existing nephric
 
 
duct epithelium. List two processes that can lengthen an epithelium.  Briefly explain what happens to 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cells during each process.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Epiboly: The cells of the tube lengthen or stretch out.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Convergent extension: Cells intercalate into the epithelial sheet forming the tube.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) The metanephric mesenchyme condenses and becomes an epithelial tube.
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i. Name the transition associated with this conversion?  Mesenchymal to epithelial transition 
 
 
  
ii. Of the two cell states associated with mesenchyme and epithelium, which can migrate? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
iii. Give two possible changes that allow the mesenchymal cells to convert to a cell sheet?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
They form cell- cell junctions, and acquire apical – basal polarity and planer polarity. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d) During ureteric bud formation, the cells elongate to form the tubule. Predict the effect of  each of the 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
following events on ureteric bud formation.
i.  Cells are treated with blebbistatin, a small molecule inhibitor of myosin function.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blebbistatin inhibits myosin function, which is required for contraction of actin filaments and cell shape change,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
so the ureteric bud will likely not form as the cells cannot elongate. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

ii.	  Cells express a defective cadherin protein (a protein involved in homotypic cell adhesion) that lacks its 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
extracellular domain. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Epithelial cells would not show the cadherin dependent homotypic cell– cell adhesion required to form the ureteric
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bud. The epithelium would be defective and the bud would be small, disorganized or non-existent. 
Question 5
  
 
 
Stem cells are found in almost all organs of multi-cellular organisms. Stem cells can undergo mitotic 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cell division to form cell types that can differentiate into diverse specialized cells. Stem cells are
 
 
 
 
 
believed to have immense therapeutic potential. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a) A stem cell is known to divide asymmetrically. When a stem cell divides asymmetrically, what are 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the possible fates of its two daughter cells?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A stem cell undergoes asymmetric division to produce more daughter cells similar to the parental cell and also
 
 
 
 
 
 
some other cell progenitor cells that differentiate to form specific cell type(s). 
b) Four human embryonic cell types, originally prepared from the SAME embryo, were tested for their 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
potency in vitro. Based on the data below, complete the table by ranking the potency of these cell types. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Potency from 1-4 (1=most potent

Question 5 continued
  
c) Draw a lineage tree for the cell types  A-D using the information in the table on Page 7. 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C
 
 
 
D	 
 
 
 
d) Do each of the above cell types have the same DNA (Yes/ No)? Explain. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
They have the same DNA sequence since they are originating from the same embryo. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
e)  Induced pluripotent  stem  (iPS) cells hold great promise  since  they have  the potential  to differentiate
 
 
 
into multiple cell types. 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.  Which cell types do you start with while making iPS cells?  Adult differentiated cells 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If  you would  like  to  generate  new  kidney  tissue  for  a  patient would  you  start with  iPS  cells  or
ii.	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the embryonic stem cells? Provide a brief explanation for the choice that you made.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Since you make the iPS cells from the adult differentiated cells of the patient the iPS cells are genotypically the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
same as the host, unlike the embryonic cells and they will not be rejected by the immune system of the patient. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
f) Stem cells exist in most organs including bone marrow. Describe one experiment that proved that 
 
 
 
 
 
  
stem cells exist in the bone marrow. 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lethally irradiate a mouse to kill all existing stem cells in the bone marrow and then transplant bone marrow
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from a compatible healthy donor mouse. The re-constituted bone marrow in the recipient mouse must then be 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
serially transplanted into a third lethally irradiated mouse. The reconstitution of the full hematopoietic lineage in 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the secondary recipient provides definitive proof of the existence of stem cells. Note: The second transplantation is
required since it is possible that only progenitor/ transit amplifying cells, but not truly self-renewing, cells were 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transplanted in the first round.) 
 
 
 
 
 
g) The following schematic shows the  cell lineage hierarchy in a small intestine crypt of a mouse. The
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
epithelial surface of the intestine sloughs off continually and is renewed by fresh cells. Renewal occurs
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by movement of transit amplifying cells from invaginations called crypts.

Question 5 continued
 
By doing a pulse chase experiment you determine that stem cells give rise to daughter stem cells and to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transit amplifying cells. Transit amplifying cells can divide to produce daughter cells that ultimately
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
differentiate into goblet cells and mature enterocytes. These differentiated cells die within 2-3 days and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are shed from the epithelial surface. Briefly describe the underlying principle of a pulse chase 
 
experiment.
 
 
 
 
 
 
You label the cells with BrdU, a thymidine analog, for a small time interval. Then you allow the cells to grow and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
divide in the presence of  dTTP. The faster the cells turn over, the more will be the dilution of BrdU labeled cells.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
So by looking at the decrease in the number of BrdU labeled cells you can determine the rate of cell division i.e. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
turn over and also the migration of cells in an organ in vivo. 
 
h) In the diagram on the right on Page 8, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.	  Mark the region (choose from A, B or C) where you would find the transit amplifying cells? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Regions B (which divide to form mature enterocytes and goblet cells) and C (which can divide to form the
 
paneth cells). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.	  Are the transit amplifying cells uncommitted, committed or differentiated relative to the Stem
 
cells? Choose one, and explain your choice.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
They are somewhat more committed than the stem cells as they are further down the stem cell lineage. But
 
 
 
they are not differentiated. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iii.	  Accumulation of mutations in which cell type (choose from stem cells, transit amplifying cells, goblet 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cells, enterocytes and paneth cells) is potentially most harmful to the animal? Explain your choice.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stem cells persist through the life-time of an individual. They self renew and form the cells of the transit lineage
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pathway, which further divide to form the differentiated cells. Thus, the mutation in stem cells will be most
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
harmful since they will persist throughout the lifetime and will also be transferred both to the progenitor and the
 
differentiated cells. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stem cells give rise to specific cell types based on the signals they receive from the "niche".

iv.	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Looking at the diagram of a crypt, and taking into account the information given, indicate 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which are likely to be the niche cells of the crypt. Explain your choice.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Most likely, the cells that close to regions B or C of the crypt are the cells that make the niche since they are most
 
likely to send the signals that can induce the proliferation of the stem cells to make the progenitor cells that can
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
give rise to different differentiated cell types.  Alternatively, one can also argue the apoptosis of the cells that form
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
the intestinal lining  may be signal that allows the stem cells in the crypt to divide.
