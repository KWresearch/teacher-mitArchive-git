a) Give the most likely mode of inheritance of disease shown in this pedigree. X- Linked recessive 
 
b) List all the possible genotypes of the following individuals in the above pedigree. 
 
Individual 1: XAXa or XAXA  Individual 6: XAXa 
Individual 22: XAXa 
 Individual 20: XAY 
 
 
c) Individual #8 from this pedigree mates with a person who has wild-type allele(s) of Gene A 
associated with this disease.  Together they have a son and a daughter. 
 
i.  What is the probability of their son being affected? ½ since #8 is a carrier 
 
ii.  What is the probability of their daughter being affected?  0 
 
iii.  What is the probability of their daughter being a carrier? ½ since #8 is a carrier 
 
d) Your friend shows you the following pedigree and says that the disease shown in this pedigree ha
s 
the same mode of inheritance as the pedigree above.  Would you agree or disagree with your friend? 
  
Provide an explanation for your choice.
 
 
 
You would disagree. Pedigree 1 is showing an X linke
d 
 
recessive mode of inheritance.  If the 2nd pedigree was 
 
d 
also showing the same mode of inheritance, the affecte
 
e 
female (#4) should be receiving one copy of the diseas
 
associated allele, with its location on the X 
 
chromosome, from her mother (#1, making her a 
 
g 
carrier) and the other copy from her father (#2, makin
him affected). But the father is not shaded/ affected in 
 
 
 
the pedigree. Thus this pedigree is not consistent with
 
the X- linked recessive mode of inheritance.

b) You label the DNA of a eukaryotic cells using BrdU (a thymidine analog). You then remove the 
nucleus of this cell (enucleated cell). You are surprised to see that the enucleated cell still has some 
DNA that is BrdU labeled. How can you explain  this?  
As per the endosymbiotic theory, the mitochondria are primitive prokaryotic cells that got embedded  into a bigger 
cell and continued staying in a symbiotic relationship with it. Therefore mitochondria have their own genome and 
hence the DNA, which is getting labeled with BrdU. It is this BrdU labeled DNA, which you are seeing in the cell 
even after the removal of the nucleus. Note: Its worth remembering that although we have paternal and maternal 
chromosomes we ALL receive our mitochondrial DNA from our moms.

cells.  Briefly describe an experiment that supports the involvement of NPC proteins in Ebola infection. 
There  are  multiple  experiments  that  you  can  design.    The  following  experimental  design  is  based  on  what  was 
discussed  in  the  lecture.You  knock  out  both  the  alleles  of  NPC  genes  (generate  NPC-/NPC-  cells)    from  the

It replicates the DNA in 5’->3’ direction and

No, since the replication is being 
done in vitro and there is no RNA 
primer to begin with. 
No, since you are making only one 
DNA strand continuously in a 5’-

No, since you are starting with

Question 3 continued 
e) While studying replication in a bacterial cell type you find a mutant that shows a 100 fold decrease in 
the fidelity of replication.  
 
i.  Name the protein(s)/enzyme(s) that is mutated in this bacterial mutant and accounts for 
decreased replication fidelity.  
 DNA polymerase 
 
ii.  What particular activity does this protein(s)/ enzyme(s) lack that regulates the fidelity of 
replication? 
It lacks its 3’->5’ exonuclease activity as a result of which it cannot proofread the replicating DNA. 
 
f) The DNA polymerase enzyme binds to the “ori site” and starts elongating the 3’OH end of the RNA 
primer by adding the nucleotide bases that are complementary to the sequence of the template DNA 
strand. Each replication cycle results in the shortening of chromosomal ends.  
 
Explain why the Ori site in general is rich in adenine (A) and thymine (T) bases. 
i. 
There are only two hydrogen bonds between an A/T base pair compared to three between every G/C base pair. The 
fewer hydrogen bonds allow the two strands to unwind easily at the A/T rich ori site.  
 
The rate of mitotic cell division in an embryonic cell is much higher compared to a normal 
ii. 
somatic cell in an adult. Briefly explain how the telomerase activity may regulate the number of 
mitotic divisions a cell can have during its life- time.   
In the absence of a functional telomerase in adult somatic cells, the chromosomal ends continue to shorten with 
each cell division. This eventually results in the loss of genetic information, which is crucial for cell division and 
cell survival. 
 
g) DNA, unlike RNA, is stable and therefore serves as the hereditary material for most organisms.  
 
i.  What feature of RNA makes it less stable than DNA? 
The hydroxyl group (-OH group) at the 2’C position of the ribose sugar in each ribonucleotide (rNTP) makes the 
RNA less stable and more reactive compared to the DNA. 
 
The fidelity of transcription is always less than the fidelity of replication. Explain why is this so.  
ii. 
This  is because DNA  is transcribed  into RNA by the RNA polymerase enzyme that  lacks the proofreading ability 
unlike the DNA polymerase. 
 
iii.  A  cell  much  better  tolerates  errors  during  transcription  than  errors  during  DNA  replication.
Explain why is this so. 
Transcription  of  a  gene  results  in  the  generation  of  multiple  copies  of  an  mRNA  transcript.  Although  some  of 
these may  carry mutations many  others  do not  and  hence  they  can  be  translated  to make  enough  proteins, which 
allows  the  cell  to  maintain  its  normal  structure  and  function.  Besides,  RNA  is  highly  reactive  and  unstable
compared  to  the  DNA  and  hence  the  mRNA  transcripts  (including  the  ones  carrying  the  mutations)  will  be
degraded much rapidly thus will not hamper the structure and function of a cell.

Question 4 
a) Below is an electron micrograph of a gene that is being transcribed. The DNA strand runs 
horizontally with RNA transcripts extending vertically outward. 

 

i.  Draw an arrow to indicate the direction of movement of RNA polymerases along the length of 
DNA strand. Why did you choose this direction? 
The longest mRNA will be associated with the RNA polymerases that have been transcribing the longest time. 
 
Below is a partial sequence of the gene that is being transcribed in the schematic above. Its 
ii. 
orientation is the same as that shown in the schematic. Which strand is the template strand, 
the top or the bottom strand? Explain 
your choice. 
 
5’ACTCGATGCTAG3’ 
3’TGAGCTACGATC5’ 
The top strand is the template strand. From part (i) we already know that RNA polymerase is moving from right 
to left and we also know that mRNA is transcribed in a 5’->3’ direction. Therefore the DNA template strand 
should be read from 3’->5’ from right to left. The top strand satisfies this requirement. 
 
iii.  Give the sequence of the mRNA that would be transcribed from the above sequence and label 
its 5’ and 3’ ends. 
5’CUAGCAUCGUCGAGU3’

promoters for Gene 1 (p1) and Gene 2 (p2) are shown.

i.  Would the direction of transcription of Gene 1 be the same as that for Gene 2 (Yes/ No)? Explain 
your choice with reference to the promoters. 
No, it will not be the same. The direction of transcription is determined by the location of the promoter, which is 
always located prior to the transcribed region of the gene. Therefore for Gene 1, the bottom strand is the template 
DNA strand that is read 3’->5’ by the RNA polymerase to make the mRNA in a 5’->3’ direction. In comparison, 
for Gene 2, the top strand is the template DNA strand that is read 3’->5’ by the RNA polymerase to make the 
mRNA in a 5’->3’ direction. 
 
ii.  On the schematic above, show the direction of transcription of Gene 1 and Gene 2 by drawing 
the arrows. 
iii.  Circle the region(s) on each gene where the transcription factors would most likely bind and 
regulate transcription. 
You should circle the promoters i.e. P1 for Gene 1 and P2 for Gene2.

Question 4 continued 
c) You realize that Gene 1 is expressed in intestinal cells of mice and mutations in this gene are 
associated with Crohn’s disease. Further analysis reveals… 
 
•  That the coding sequence of Gene 1 is the same in affected and wild- type mice.  
•  There is much less of mature mRNA transcribed from Gene 1 in the affected mice relative to that in the 
wild-type mice.   
•  The intestinal cells of the affected mice show no detectable protein unlike the wild-type mice. 
 
 Give two possible modifications of RNA, whose absence may explain the differences that you have 
observed between the affected and wild- type mice. 
The mature mRNA lacks the 5’CAP and/ or 3’Poly A tail which stabilize the mRNA and promote its 
translocation from the nucleus into the cytosol where it can be translated. In the absence of these modifications, 
the transcribed mRNA will be very unstable and will not be available to get translated into a protein. 
 
d) Gene 2 is expressed in mouse heart muscle cells and its over-expression (too much of it) is associated 
with heart disease.  You try to reduce the expression of Gene 2 using a particular micro RNA (miRNA-
32) that you think may regulate Gene 2. 
 
i.  Circle the sequence (choose from promoter, nascent (primary) RNA, mature mRNA, 5' UTR and 3’ 
UTR) to which the miRNA is most likely to bind?   3’UTR 
 
Briefly describe how the miRNA may inhibit expression of Gene 2. 
ii. 
These are 21-22 bases long stretches of RNA which hydrogen bond with specific complementary bases at the 
3’untranslated regions (3’UTR) of the transcribed mRNA and thereby inhibit its translation. 
 
e) From your 7.013 lectures, you have learnt that although almost all cells in an organism contain an 
identical genome, gene expression differs in different cell types and is highly regulated by chromatin 
structure. Given the following treatments, explain whether chromatin structure compacts or becomes 
less compact and whether gene expression is enhanced or reduced. 
 
i.  Cells are treated with DNA methylase, an enzyme that adds methyl groups to cytosine bases in 
DNA. 
The chromatin will be in the condensed state since enhanced methylation prevents histone removal resulting in 
more condensed packaging/folding of chromatin structure and reduced transcription. Note: It is worth 
noting that methylation at ALL positions do not have this effect, instead it is usually the methylation of base at 
5C position that promotes condensation and close packing. 
 
ii.  Cells are treated with histone acetylase, an enzyme that adds acetyl groups to the histone 
proteins thus making them less basic. 
The chromatin will be in the open state since enhanced methylation prevents histone removal resulting in more 
unpackaging/unfolding of chromatin structure and reduced transcription. 
 
f) As we mentioned in lecture, Prader-Willi (PW) syndrome is a rare disorder that results in intellectual 
disability, a constant sense of hunger and obesity. This syndrome is caused by deletion or inactivation 
of seven genes that lie on Chromosome 15. Normally, these genes are INACTIVE on the maternally-
contributed chromosome, but ACTIVE on the paternally-contributed chromosome. PW syndrome 
occurs because the paternal genes that should be expressed are not for one of the following reasons:  
•  Paternal genes on chromosome 15 are missing or defective. 
•  The patient has inherited two copies of chromosome 15 from the mother and no chromosome 15 from the 
father.  
i.  Of what is the PW syndrome an example? Explain the reasoning behind this answer. 
This is an example of mammalian imprinting i.e. inheritance of maternal or paternal specific methylation pattern. 
In the affected individuals, the maternally- contributed chromosome is silenced (similar to that in normal 
individual) but the paternal chromosome is either inactive or not present (unlike the normal healthy individuals) 
thus leading to the disease.

Question 4 continued 
ii. 
You isolate cells from a PW patient and try to activate the Chromosome 15 genes. Circle the 
option from below that you would try. Explain your reasoning. 
•  Treat cells with 5-azacytidine that inhibits DNA methylase 
 
•  Treat cells with 2-chloroethyl-N-nitrosourea (CNU) that activates DNA methylase.

b) The following schematic represents the 3D- conformation of a tRNA molecule. One end of the tRNA

i. 

ii.  Would a substitution within a codon for trp always change the resulting protein sequence? 
Explain your answer. 
Yes, since there is only one codon for tryptophan. Hence a base substitution in either 1, 2 or 3 position of the 
codon would result either in a different amino acid or a stop codon. 
 
iii.  Would a substitution within a codon for threonine (thr) always change the resulting protein 
sequence? Explain your answer. 
No, since threonine can be encoded by four different codons. All these four codons have the same base at 1st and 2nd 
position. However they all have a different base at the 3rd position. Therefore a base substitution at 3rd position will 
not change the protein sequence since the codon will still code of Threonine.

a) The following is the partial DNA sequence of Gene 1. Note: The underlined sequence (from position 20-54) 
represents the promoter for Gene 1 and the underlined and italicized sequence (from position 71-90 represents the ribosome

Question 7 
Following are three genes that encode small peptides. The splice site donor always has the composition 
5’-GUG-3’ (i.e. for the 5’ end of the splice site) and the splice site acceptor always has the sequence 5’-
UUG-3’ (i.e. for the 3’ end of the splice site), meaning that these sequences and everything between 
them will be removed from the mature mRNA. Only the non-template/ mRNA like strands of DNA

The 49th base in the non-template strand of Gene 2 was changed from G to T. 
ii. 
A pre-mature stop codon will be inserted resulting in a truncated non-functional peptide. This is an example of 
nonsense mutation. 
 
The 4th base in the non-template strand of Gene 2 was changed from A to T. 
iii. 
This will result in the loss of first start codon. The 2nd start codon will be used to make the protein. The mRNA will be 
read in a different frame. Therefore the resulting peptide will have a different amino acid sequence and will be non-
functional.  
 
 
The 47th base in the non-template strand of Gene 3 was changed from C to T. 
iv. 
This mutation creates a new 3’splice acceptor site (3’UUG). This is an example of a mutation that changes the 
reading frame of mature mRNA and therefore the amino acid sequence of the resulting peptide.
