7.013 Problem Set 7 - 2013
 
 
   
 
 
 
 

 
Question 1
 
a) Neuronal path finding is crucial for structured cellular organization and development of neural 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
circuits. The elongation or retraction of the growth cone is dependent on the guidance cues. You are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
looking at the response of the growth cone to the following guidance cues. Note: In this example you may 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
assume that both these guidance cues serve as attractants. 
 
 
 
•  Guidance cue 1: Fibronectin protein that is a part of ECM. 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Guidance cue 2: Ephrins, which diffuse along their concentration gradient. 
 
 
 
 
 
i.  Classify the two guidance cues as short- or long- range signals. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
Fibronectin: 	 
Ephrins: 
 
 
You do a stripe assay to determine if fibronectin serves as attractive guidance cues. Briefly

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
explain how this assay works.
 
 
 
 
 

ii.	 
 

 

iii.	 
 

The stripe assay is an in vitro assay, that is, performed outside the body. You next need to

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
determine whether fibronectin and ephrins are the normal guidance cue for these neurons in

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the brain. Give an experiment that can help you answer this question.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) A key question in neurobiology is how neurons find their targets to generate circuits. Retinal
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
neurons transmit information about the light that the eye perceives to the brain in the form of electrical
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
signals. The cell bodies of these neurons are in the eye. During development they connect to a region of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the brain known as the optic tectum. The goal of recent research has been to figure out how they do
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this. The following inhibitors disrupt innervation of the tectum by retinal neurons. Complete the table
 
 
 
 
 
for each of the following treatments.

Question 1 continued
 
c) Ephrin is a ligand found in the optic tectum in a gradient, with more caudally (C), than rostrally (R).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Temporally located retinal neurons (T) normally grow to the caudal tectum, as depicted below. When 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ephrin concentration is high throughout the tectum, retinal neurons stop in the rostral region (R).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, when ephrin concentration is low throughout the tectum, temporal retinal neurons grow
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
past the tectum.

their path? 
 
        

    

ii.	  The receptor that binds ephrin is the Eph 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
receptor. Where is the Eph receptor most likely
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to be expressed in the schematic on the left? 
      
 
 
 
iii.	  Using the data in the schematic, explain why
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
during normal development, the temporal
 
 
retinal neurons grow to the caudal tectum.

Question 2
  
 
 
Cancer is caused by accumulation of two or more mutations in the same cell that affects its proliferation 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and survival. 
 
 
a) Why does a person’s chance of having cancer increases with age? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) Why is cancer mostly considered a genetic disease of somatic cells?

Question 2 continued
 
c) The Ames test is very often used to evaluate the mutagenic potential of a chemical agent. The test 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
employs a strain of bacteria that have mutation in a gene(s) that codes for an enzyme(s), which is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
involved in the synthesis of the amino acid histidine. These bacterial strains are therefore His–  (cannot 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
synthesize histidine) and they grow only in the growth medium that contains histidine.  However, a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compensatory mutation to this gene(s) may cause the His- bacterial strain to revert to a His+ strain that
 
 
 
 
 
 
can grow in the medium that lacks histidine. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You want to test the mutagenic potential of benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) found in cigarettes smoke. You
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
want to perform the following experiments using this carcinogen. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Experiment 1: You incubate the His- bacterial cells with B(a)P  and plate them on cell culture plates with
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
media that lack histidine.  After incubating the plate overnight at 37oC, you observe NO colonies on this 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
plate. 
 
 
 
•	  Experiment 2: You inject B(a)P in  mice every alternative day for one month. You carefully observe these
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
mice overtime and see that that they develop a solid tumor. 
 
•	  Experiment 3: You first incubate B(a)P with liver extract that contains metabolic  and detoxifying enzymes
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and then add the His- bacterial cells to the incubation mix. You plate the bacterial cells on cell culture
 
 
plates with media that lack histidine and incubate them overnight for 24 hrs at 37oC. You find abundant 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
colonies appearing on this plate. 
 
Circle the option from the choices below that best characterizes B(a)P and explain why you selected 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this option. 
 
 
 
     
Mutagen 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d) The following are three bacterial mutants that have different mutations in the DNA sequence that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
encodes the C-terminus of an enzyme (200 amino acids long) that is required for Histidine biosynthesis
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and that requires Gln197  for its function.  The DNA sequence corresponding to the last five amino acids 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the wild- type and three different mutant versions (1/ 2/ 3) of this enzyme is included within the 
 
 
 
 
sequence below. Please Note: A codon chart is provided on the last page of this problem set.

Question 2 continued 
 
You treat mutants 1, 2 & 3 separately with two mutagens; mutagen C causes point mutations in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
comparison to mutagen D that results in frame-shift mutations. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Section_______  TA_____________ 

 
i.	  Which bacterial mutant (choose from 1, 2 or 3) can revert to wild- type following the treatment 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with mutagen C? Explain why you selected this option.

with mutagen D? Explain why you selected this option. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
e) Although most carcinogens are mutagenic there are examples of some non- mutagenic carcinogens.
Alcohol is one such example and excess consumption of alcohol is very often related to liver cancer. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Explain how alcohol over- consumption may cause liver cancer. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 3
 
a) Many of the mutations that cause cancer involve oncogenes, whereas others involve tumor
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
suppressor genes. Suppose that you had the ability to introduce the wild- type copy of a gene into a
 
 
 
 
 
transformed cell. 
 
 
 
If the cell is transformed due to mutation of a tumor suppressor gene, would you expect that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adding the wild- type copy of the mutated gene would restore the cell’s wild- type phenotype
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Yes/ No)? Explain your choice. 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 

ii.	 
 

If the cell is transformed due to an oncogenic mutation, would you expect that adding the wild-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
type copy of the mutated gene would restore the cell’s wild- type phenotype (Yes/ No)? Explain 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
your choice. 
 
 

 
 
b) Cancer is caused by accumulation of mutations in the same cell that affect its proliferation and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
survival. In the table below, you introduce a single copy of the mutant gene into an immortalized/ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
non- tumorigenic cell line. For each gene, state the phenotype of the cell that has received a single copy of the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mutant gene by choosing from transformed (characteristics of cancer cells) or untransformed (characteristics of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
wild-type cells) phenotype. Consider introduction of each gene separately.

Question 3 continued
 
c) MSH2 is a gene commonly associated with familial nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. This gene
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
encodes a protein that is involved in correcting the mismatched nucleotides. Briefly explain why the
 
 
 
 
 
 
individuals who are heterozygous for the loss-of- function mutation of MSH2 gene (MSH2+/MSH2-) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from birth are very likely to develop colon cancer very early in their lives. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d) The following pedigree represents the inheritance of predisposition to colon cancer that is caused 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by a mutation in the MSH2 gene. Give the most likely inherited genotype at the MSH2 locus for each 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the following individuals.  Please Note: Use MSH2+ for the wild-type allele and MSH2- for the mutant
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
allele. You may ignore the SNP information for this part of the question. Also note that people marrying into the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
family  only have wild- type copies of MSH2 gene. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A/A  A/A  A/T 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
e) You continue to study this family and are surprised when individual 5 has a child that develops
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
colon cancer at an early age.  You analyze a tightly linked SNP marker for the members of this family.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The alleles of SNP for each individual are shown in the pedigree. 
 
i.	  Assuming no recombination between SNP and the MSH2 locus, what allele of SNP is linked to 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
the “MSH2” allele in individual 1? 
ii.	  Assuming no recombination between SNP and the MSH2 loci, how can you explain the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phenotype of individual 5?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 4
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a) p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in 50% of the cancers including cervical cancer. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.	  The Human papilloma virus  (HPV) has been  implicated  as  a  risk  factor  for  cervical  cancer. The
 
E6  protein  of  HPV  binds  to  and  inactivates  p53.  Explain  why  the  virally  encoded  E6  protein 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
can result in cells that form a tumor.

Question 4 continued
 
 
ii.  It is possible to create a knock out mouse model where both the alleles of p53 gene are deleted
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(p53-/p53-). Such mice can survive for 4-6 months but are highly prone to developing cancer.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Would you predict that a tumor composed of cells that are p53-/p53- (a tumor suppressor
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gene) would be more or less sensitive to radiation than a tumor that is p53+/p53-? Explain 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
your answer. 

Section_______  TA_____________ 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) Gardasil is a preventive vaccine against HPV infections,which are the most common cause of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cervical cancers. The major capsid protein of HPV can spontaneously assemble to form virus like
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
particles (VLPs) that resemble HPV. Gardasil contains recombinant VLPs. These VLPs can induce an 
immunological response that prevents HPV infection but they do not cause cancer. Explain why 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gardasil can induce an immune response in an individual. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) Radiation and chemotherapy are very often used individually or in combination to treat different
 
  
types of cancers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.	  Both radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs often have side effects such as diarrhea, constipation,
 
mouth sores, hair loss, nausea, and blood-related side effects. Explain why the side effects are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the same for radiation and a variety of different chemotherapeutic drugs. 

 

 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.	  Prior to being used for treatment, each chemotherapeutic drug is extensively screened. During
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
drug screening you identify two compounds A and B that have the potential to kill cancer cells
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and normal cells as shown by the following graph. Which compound (choose from compound A or 
 
 
 
compound B) is a better candidate for cancer treatment? Explain why you selected this option.

Question 5
 
a) Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematological cancer of myeloid origin that occurs
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
predominantly in adults.  Most of the CML patients show a chromosomal translocation that results in 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the formation of the Bcr-Abl fusion gene or Philadelphia Chromosome. This gene encodes for Bcr-Abl
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
tyrosine kinase protein. 
 

Section_______  TA_____________ 

 
i.  Consider a patient who has CML, and answer the following questions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
•	  Would the Philadelphia chromosomal translocation be present in all of the cells in the patient’s
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
blood system? 
  
 

 

•	  How many independent times did the Philadelphia chromosomal translocation occur in the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
patient? 

 

•	  Could the patient pass CML onto his/her kids? Explain your choice. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

•  Would all the cancer cells in this patient have the same gene expression profile (Yes/ No)? Explain 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
your choice. 

ii.	  CML patients are effectively treated with Gleevec, which inhibits Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by binding to its ATP binding pocket. 
 
 
 
 
•  The CML patients relapse if they stop taking Gleevec. Explain why is this so. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

•	  CML patients over time generate Gleevec-resistant clones that have mutations in their kinase 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
domain. Briefly explain how the mutations in the kinase domain of Bcr-Abl fusion gene result 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in Gleevec resistance. 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

•  The Gleevec resistant clones however respond to another drug, Spryzel. If the patients are given 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
both Gleevec and Spryzel together at the beginning of treatment, the generation of drug-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
resistant clones can be delayed. Explain why is this so. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
c) Approximately 25-30% of women with breast cancer over-express Her-2 receptor proteins. If these
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients are treated with Herceptin antibody, specific for Her-2 receptors, the Her-2 over-expressing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
breast cancer cells are specifically attacked by the patient’s own immune system. Additionally, these

Question 6
Influenza virus is a single minus stranded, segmented, RNA virus that does not replicate via a DNA
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
intermediate. The virus typically infects vertebrate epithelial cells. The following is a schematic of the

a) Based on the details provided in the schematic is it more likely that this virus escapes its host cell via
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a mechanism involving cell lysis or budding? Explain. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) Influenza virus is unable to make more viral RNA within the host cells using exclusively the host cell
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
proteins. 
  
 
i.  Explain why this is so. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) Explain why we need to develop a new vaccine against the flu virus almost each flu season. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d) You decide to generate a vaccine against Influenza virus that would elicit a humoral response. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Which viral proteins are best candidates for designing vaccine?

Question 6 continued  (Note: Part (e) is optional and will not be graded)
 
e) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus. Its genome is a single (+) stranded RNA that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is packaged with the reverse transcriptase enzyme within a protein capsid. This is further packaged 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
into an envelope that is derived from the plasma membrane of the host cell in which the virus had
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
replicated. The surface of the envelope is covered with the envelope glycoprotein, called gp120. 
  
i.	  HIV  specifically  infects  the T- helper  (TH)  cells  of  the  human  immune  system.  If  the HIV  enters
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the  host  cell  by  means  of  host  receptor  recognizing  a  viral  protein,  what  would  be  the  most 
likely ligand and its corresponding receptor during HIV infection? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 

ii.	 
 

Some  individuals  are  resistant  to  HIV  infection  even  after  repeated  exposure.  Assuming  that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these  individuals  express  a  normal  level  of  the  functional  receptor  that  you  have  recognized
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
above, how can you explain their resistance to HIV? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
iii.	 

In  recent  years,  therapies  have  been  developed  to  fight  AIDS  using  nucleotide  analogs.  The
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
drug  used  to  combat  AIDS  is  Azidothymine  (AZT).  The  structure  of  AZT  is  very  similar  to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
thymidine  except  that  in  AZT,  the  3’-OH  group  on  the  deoxyribose  sugar  is  replaced  by  an
azido (N3) group. Which process of the life cycle of HIV do you think is inhibited by AZT?
