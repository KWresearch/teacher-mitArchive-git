c)  The  diverse  array  of  TcR  and  the  antibodies  is  generated  by  DNA  rearrangement.  However  this 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
diversity  is  further  enhanced  by  the  function  of  enzymes  like  terminal  transferases.  Briefly  explain 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
how the activity of terminal transferase enzyme further contributes to antibody diversity. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d)  Although  the  immune  system  has  the  IgG  (secreted  antibody)  and  the  IgM  (usually  cell  surface
 
 
 
 
 
antibody) antibody molecules with  the antigen- binding site against  the same antigen  these  two classes
 
  
 
 
 
 
of antibody have very different structure.

e)  Very  rarely,  the  immune  system  in  some  individuals  may  produce  cells  that  can  recognize  “self-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
antigens”.  These  individuals  therefore  develop  autoimmune  diseases  such  as  lupus,  rheumatoid 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
arthritis,  Type  1  diabetic  and multiple  sclerosis.  Briefly  describe  how  the  self-reacting  T  or  B  cells  are

f)  Organ  transplant  is  required  in  various  clinical  conditions.  One  has  to  consider  various  criteria  in 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
order to reduce the chances of transplant rejection. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.	  Name the surface molecule(s) that is critical in preventing transplant rejection. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Is this molecule(s) expressed on the surface of ALL nucleated cell (Yes/ No)? Explain your

Question 2
You purify a novel viral protein (Protein R) and intend to further characterize it. Accordingly, you
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
develop antibodies against Protein R. You inject Protein R into a rabbit, draw out some blood from the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rabbit after a month and confirm the presence of Protein R specific antibody in the rabbit’s blood. You
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
wait for two months and then re-inject Protein R into the same rabbit.  You observe a stronger  and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
much rapid development of secondary immune response specific to Protein R. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a) On the graph below… 
 
 
 
i.  Draw the primary and secondary immune responses specific to Protein R as a solid line (-).

to your experimental rabbit? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.  How does this additional immune response in part (i) destroy the virus- infected cells? 
 

 

 
 
 
 
Question 3
 
 
a) You come across an online article titled “How Carrot-Chocolate Shakes Improve Memory?" The
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
summary reads: “After drinking Carrot-Chocolate shake mix, mice show an immediate (within 10
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
seconds) increase in memory. The authors of the study claim that the shake… 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Increases the amplitude of the action potential in hippocampal neurons (involved in memory)
i.	 
 
 
 
 
  
from +55mV to +90mV 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.  Changes the threshold potential from -50mV to -40mV. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
iii. 
Furthermore, it works by targeting the metabotropic AMPA receptors.

Feeding mice the protein “Na+K+ATPase pump” improves their memory. 
i.	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
ii. 
This pump is essential for transmitting a signal along a neuron. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is not used anywhere else in the body.”

Question 4
GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in central nervous system (CNS). It acts by binding to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
GABA-A receptors that are chloride channels and GABA-B receptors that activate K+ channels via G
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
proteins. 
  
G proteins 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) K+ concentration is high inside the neuron, while Ca2+, Na+ and Cl- ion concentrations are high 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
outside. Passage of Na+ into the neuron is responsible for an action potential. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In what direction will Na+  ions flow when the GABA-A receptor is activated – in or out of the 
i.	 
 
 
neuron? 

 
 
a) In response to GABA, would you expect both types

c) You culture a GABAergic neuron (i.e. one that produces GABA) in the presence of the following
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
neurotoxins in two separate petri-plates (Plate A & Plate B).

d) Give two possible mechanisms by which GABA is removed from the synapse? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
e) Consider the following synapse between two neurons. 
 
•	  Neuron 1 when stimulated secretes epinephrine. This neuron expresses the GABA-A and GABA-B 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
receptors.
 
   
• 
 
•  Neuron 2 when stimulated secretes GABA. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If neuron 2 is pre- synaptic and neuron 1 is post- synaptic would you expect Neuron 1 to secrete
epinephrine? Explain your choice. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
f) A functional neuron may receive both excitatory and inhibitory signals from multiple neurons at the
 
 
 
 
 
 
synaptic junctions. In a post- synaptic neuron, where are the signals from all the pre- synaptic
excitatory or inhibitory synapses integrated and the decision to fire an action potential made? Circle

g) The following schematic shows two excitatory pre-synaptic neurons that independently converge
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on a post-synaptic neuron. The two pre-synaptic neurons can be stimulated individually. In the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
absence of any stimulation, the recording electrode in the post-synaptic neuron measures the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
membrane potential as -60mV. 
 

Section_______  TA_____________ 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If only one excitatory pre-synaptic neuron is stimulated, you record a deviation from -60mV with the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recording electrode in the post-synaptic neuron, but you do not record an action potential. If both the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
excitatory pre-synaptic neurons are stimulated, you record an action potential in the post-synaptic

Question 5
 
a) Neuronal path finding is crucial for structured cellular organization and development of neural
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
circuits. The elongation or retraction of the growth cone is dependent on the guidance cues. You are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
looking at the response of the growth cone to the following guidance cues. Note: In this example you may 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
assume that both these guidance cues serve as attractants. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Guidance cue 1: Fibronectin protein that is a part of ECM. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Guidance cue 2: Ephrins, which diffuse along their concentration gradient. 
 
 
 
 
i.  Classify the two guidance cues as short- or long- range signals. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Fibronectin: 	 
Ephrins: 
 
 
 

 
ii. 	 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You do a stripe assay to determine if fibronectin and ephrins serve as attractive guidance cues.
 
Briefly explain how this assay works, and what results you would get if one of these proteins is
 
 
an attractive guidance cue. 

 

iii.	 
 

 
 
 
 
 
The stripe assay is an in vitro assay, that is, performed outside the body. You next need to

 
 
 
 
 
determine whether fibronectin and ephrins are the normal guidance cue for these neurons in

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the brain. Give an experiment that can help you answer this question.
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) A key question in neurobiology is how neurons find their targets to generate circuits. Retinal
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
neurons transmit information about the light that the eye perceives to the brain in the form of electrical
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
signals. The cell bodies of these neurons are in the eye. During development they connect to a region of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the brain known as the optic tectum. The goal of recent research has been to figure out how they do
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this. The following inhibitors disrupt innervation of the tectum by retinal neurons. Complete the table
 
 
 
 
 
for each of the following treatments.

Question 5 continued
c) Ephrin is a ligand found in the optic tectum in a gradient, with more caudally (C), than rostrally (R).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Temporally located retinal neurons (T) normally grow to the caudal tectum, as depicted below. When
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ephrin concentration is high throughout the tectum, retinal neurons stop in the rostral region (R).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, when ephrin concentration is low throughout the tectum, temporal retinal neurons grow
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
past the tectum.
