Question 1
During a summer hike you suddenly spot a huge grizzly bear.  This emergency situation triggers a
fight or flight response through a signaling pathway as shown below. 
β 1-adrenergic 
 
receptor 
Adrenaline 

Adenylyl 
cyclase 

G protein 
GTP 

G protein 
GDP 

cAMP               ATP 

Plasma 
membrane 

β -arrestin 

Protein  
KinaseA 

BARK
K 
K
 

Increased 
heart rate 

Increased fat 
breakdown 

Note:                    represents activation                                       represents repression. 
Some major features of this pathway are outlined below: 
•	  The small molecule adrenaline binds to its β1-adrenergic membrane receptor. 
Following the binding to adrenaline, this receptor acts as a kinase and converts the inactive GDP bound G proteins
•	 
to the active GTP bound G proteins. 
•	  The GTP bound G proteins activate the adenylyl cyclase enzyme. 
•	  The GTP bound G proteins are inactivated by re-conversion to the GDP bound form. 
•	  Adenylyl cyclase enzyme converts ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). 
•	  The cAMP binds and activates Protein Kinase A. 
•	  This results in an increased heart rate and breakdown of fat to trigger the “Fight or Flight” response. 
•	  The Protein Kinase A enzyme also activates BARK kinase. 
•	  The activated BARK activates β-arrestin, which inhibits β1-adrenergic membrane receptor activity. 
a) Name the 1st and the 2nd ligand in this pathway and give one reason that explains why the 2nd 
messenger may be important in this pathway. 

b)  In order to further understand this cellular pathway you examine this pathway in a cell after the 
following perturbations.
Perturbation 1: Αpplication of cholera toxin, which prevents G proteins from hydrolyzing GTP to GDP. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Perturbation 2:  Treatment with nebivolol, a molecule that competes with adrenaline to bind to the β1-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adrenergic membrane receptor but does not stimulate the pathway. 
 
 
 
In which of the two treatments will the adrenaline cause a constitutive (continual) activation of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adenylyl cyclase? Explain.

presence of adrenaline? Explain. 
 
 

Section_______  TA_____________ 
 

 
 
 
 
c) Consider the following perturbations in different components of the above signaling pathway in a 
 
 
 
 
 
  
cell. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
•  #1: BARK lacks its kinase domain. 
 
 
 
 
 
•  #2: β arrestin is constitutively (always) active. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  #3: β1-adrenergic membrane receptor lacks its ligand-binding domain. 
 
 
Complete the table for each of the following perturbations relative to unperturbed control cells in the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
presence of adrenaline. Note: Consider each perturbation independently while answering the questions.

Question 2

 
The origin recognition complex (ORC) is a multi- subunit protein complex that binds to the ori site(s)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and serves as a platform for the assembly of kinases like Cdk6 and Cdt1.
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the G1 phase of the cell cycle in yeast, ORC forms a pre- replication complex by recruiting Cdk6 and
 
Cdt1 that bind to both strands of DNA. These factors bind and inhibit the Mcm protein that functions as a
helicase as is shown in the schematic below. Note: The activation is shown by an →  and inhibition by ⊥ sign.

Question 2 continued
a) Activation of the pre-replication complex occurs during the S phase and this requires its interaction
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with Cdk2 and Cyclin E proteins that degrade Cdk6 and Cdt1. This results in the replication of DNA.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Draw a schematic, similar to the one on page 2, to show the regulatory interactions between ORC, 
 
 
Cdk6, Cdt1, Mcm, Cdk2 and Cyclin E proteins.  Note: Please indicate the activation by an →  and inhibition 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by ⊥ sign. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) In a cell showing a Cdk2 loss-of–function mutation, in which phase (choose from G1, S, G2, M, all or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
none) would the cell arrest?  Explain why you selected this option. 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) If the cdk-2 gene encodes Cdk-2 protein, in which phase (choose from G1, S, G2, M, all or none) will the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cdk-2 gene be expressed? Explain why you selected this option. 
 
 
 
 
d) If the cyclin E gene encodes Cyclin E protein, in which phase (choose from G1, S, G2, M or all) will the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cyclin E gene be optimally expressed? Explain why you selected this option. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
e) One method for studying the essential components that regulate different steps of the cell cycle
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
involves the use of conditional temperature-sensitive mutants. You isolate temperature-sensitive Cdk2
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
yeast mutants. These mutant cells grow normally at the permissive temperature (25°C). However these
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cells arrest at a specific point in the cell cycle when the temperature is shifted to 36°C (non-permissive
  
temperature). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Is the primary structure of the temperature-sensitive Cdk2 protein at 36°C same as or different 
i.	 
 
 
 
 
from that at 25°C? 
 
ii.	 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Is the three- dimensional conformation of the temperature-sensitive Cdk-2 protein at 36°C same 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as or different from that at 25°C? Explain why you selected this option. 
 

 

 
 

 
 
 
 
f) You grow the mutant cells, described in part (e), at 36°C or non- permissive temperature. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.  Predict the effect on G1 phase in the mutant cells grown at 36°C compared to those at 25°C. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.  Predict the effect on the S phase in the mutant cells at 36°C compared to those at 25°C.

Question 2 continued
 
 
 
 
g) You further create two mutant cells each having a mutation in Cdk-2 genes as described below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Mutant cell- type 1: The Cdk-2 protein lacks its kinase domain. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Mutant cell- type 2:  The Cdk-2 lacks its Cyclin E binding domain. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Predict what would happen to the cell cycle in… 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.  Mutant 1: 
 
 
 
  
 
ii.	  Mutant 2: 
 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
h) The proper development and functioning of different tissues and organs involves a tight regulation
 
  
 
 
 
 
of cell division and cell death. 
 
i.  A cell can die by “apoptosis”. What does this term mean? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
ii.	  Apoptosis may occur either via extrinsic or intrinsic signaling pathways. Based on what you 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have learnt in 7.013, if a cell makes the decision to die when subjected to hypoxia (low oxygen
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concentration) would you regard this as an example of extrinsic or intrinsic signaling pathway?
Explain why you selected this option. 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iii.  Apoptosis involves the activation of Caspases. Briefly explain the function of these enzymes. 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 3
 
 
 
Development of human and chicken hearts is thought to occur by very similar mechanisms. The heart
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
develops from a layer of cells called the “mesoderm”, which lies on top of another layer of cells called
   
“endoderm”. 
 
 
 
 
a) The mesoderm forms the heart, the kidney and the blood. 
 
i. What does the term “potency” mean? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii. What term would describe the potency of the mesoderm (choose from totipotent, multipotent or 
 
 
 
 
 
unipotent)? 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) You want to know when the future heart cells decide to become such. You isolate a small piece of
 
 
 
tissue (or explant), from the heart forming anterior mesoderm of a young embryo (stage 2), and also
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from a slightly older (stage 4) embryo (about 6 hours older than stage 2). You make sure to take the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
same relative region from both. You culture the tissues in tissue culture plates, examine them three
 
 
 
 
 
 
days later and tabulate your results below.

ii.	  Are the beating heart cells determined, differentiated or neither compared to Stage 4 cells? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Explain. 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) You ask why the isolated Stage 2 cells did not become a heart when they were isolated. Since the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
anterior mesoderm cells lie on top of the “endoderm” layer, you therefore modify your experiment  as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
shown in the table below and obtain the following results.

that is unlabeled 
 
Same as original unlabeled
 
 
 
Endoderm alone that is unlabeled 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cells 
 
 
 
 
 
Why does the stage 2 anterior mesoderm explant when cultured with endoderm make a heart, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
whereas the stage 2 anterior mesoderm explant alone does not? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d) You later observe that if Stage 2 cells are cultured for three days with a purified secreted protein, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BMP4, they develop and form a beating heart. Based on all the data above, where in the embryo (choose 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from mesoderm, endoderm or both) would you expect BMP4 to be expressed if it directs normal heart 
formation? Explain why you selected this option.

i.	  At the time of isolation, are the stage 2 cells determined, differentiated or undetermined 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compared to Stage 4 cells? Explain. 
 
 
 
 

Section_______  TA_____________ 
 

 
 
 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
e) Posterior mesoderm does not form the heart. To test whether BMP4 is able to turn posterior
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mesoderm into beating heart you culture the cells of the posterior mesoderm in the presence and
 
 
 
 
 
 
absence of BMP4 and obtain the following results. 
 
 
Explant 
Stage 2 posterior mesoderm explant 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stage 2 posterior mesoderm explant  + BMP4 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
You know that BMP4 is a secreted protein that activates its receptor via phosphorylation. The activated receptor
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phosphorylates a transcription factor, Smad1. Phospho-Smad1 moves to the nucleus to change transcription of
  
target genes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Using the above information, suggest why posterior mesoderm does not respond to BMP4.

f) Anterior mesoderm cultured with BMP4 alone develops into a heart, while anterior mesoderm
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treated with BMP and fibroblast growth factor (FGF, another signaling protein) develops into kidney. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You examine the combinatorial code required to determine heart or kidney, using tissue from these
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatments, and obtain the following results.

Question 4
 
 
 
Kidney is an organ that is comprised of 10 different cell types and has a specific 3- dimensional
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
structure. Its formation involves the reciprocal interactions between the nephric duct (a tube) and the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
metanephric mesenchyme. First, the metanephric mesenchyme induces the duct to form a new tube
 
 
called the ureteric bud. The ureteric bud induces the metanephric mesenchyme, which then forms the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
glomerulus, the principal filtration region of the kidney.

b) Formation of the ureteric bud, a tube, requires branching and lengthening of the existing nephric
 
 
duct epithelium. List two processes that can lengthen an epithelium.  Briefly explain what happens to 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cells during each process. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) The metanephric mesenchyme condenses and becomes an epithelial tube. 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
i. Name the transition associated with this conversion? 
 
 
ii. Of the two cell states associated with mesenchyme and epithelium, which can migrate? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iii. Give two possible changes that allow the mesenchymal cells to convert to a cell sheet?

ii.	  Cells express a defective cadherin protein (a protein involved in homotypic cell adhesion) that lacks its 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
extracellular domain. 
   

 
 
Question 5
  
 
Stem cells are found in almost all organs of multi-cellular organisms. Stem cells can undergo mitotic
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cell division to form cell types that can differentiate into diverse specialized cells. Stem cells are
 
 
 
 
 
 
believed to have immense therapeutic potential. 
 
 
 
a) A stem cell is known to divide asymmetrically. When a stem cell divides asymmetrically, what are 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the possible fates of its two daughter cells? 
 
 
 
b) Four human embryonic cell types, originally prepared from the SAME embryo, were tested for their

e)  Induced pluripotent  stem  (iPS) cells hold great promise  since  they have  the potential  to differentiate 
 
 
 
into multiple cell types. 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.  Which cell types do you start with while making iPS cells? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If  you would  like  to  generate  new  kidney  tissue  for  a  patient would  you  start with  iPS  cells  or

epithelial surface of the intestine sloughs off continually and is renewed by fresh cells. Renewal occurs
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by movement of transit amplifying cells from invaginations called crypts.

Question 5 continued
 
By doing a pulse chase experiment you determine that stem cells give rise to daughter stem cells and to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transit amplifying cells. Transit amplifying cells can divide to produce daughter cells that ultimately
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
differentiate into goblet cells and mature enterocytes. These differentiated cells die within 2-3 days and
 
 
are shed from the epithelial surface. Briefly describe the underlying principle of a pulse chase 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
experiment. 
 
 
 
 
 
h) In the diagram on the right on Page 8, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.  Mark the region (choose from A, B or C) where you would find the transit amplifying cells? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.	  Are the transit amplifying cells uncommitted, committed or differentiated relative to the Stem
 
cells? Choose one, and explain your choice. 
 
 
 

 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
iii.	  Accumulation of mutations in which cell type (choose from stem cells, transit amplifying cells, goblet 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cells, enterocytes and paneth cells) is potentially most harmful to the animal? Explain your choice. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

iv.	 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stem cells give rise to specific cell types based on the signals they receive from the "niche".

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Looking at the diagram of a crypt, and taking into account the information given, indicate

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which are likely to be the niche cells of the crypt. Explain your choice.
