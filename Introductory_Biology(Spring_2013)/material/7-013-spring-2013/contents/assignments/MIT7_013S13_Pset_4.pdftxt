Question 1
 
The following human pedigree shows the inheritance of a specific disease. Please note: The filled squares
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or circles represent the abnormal phenotype. The individuals marrying into the family do not have the d isease
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
associated allele. Assume that no other mutation arises within the pedigree. Also assume complete penetrance. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use the symbol XD, Xd, D or d where appropriate. 
In each case, use the letter “D” to represent the 
allele associated with the dominant phenotype 
and ‘d” to represent the allele associated with the 
recessive phenotype.

d) The disease shown by the pedigree above is caused by a mutation in Gene D that encodes Protein D.
 
 
 
 
You identify a SNP that is tightly linked to Gene D and may be used as a marker for the disease. The 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
alleles (A, G, T, C) of this SNP for some individuals are given in the pedigree above.

f) Although  SNPs c  an  be  in  the  coding, non-coding  or  intergenic (regions between  two  genes)  of  the 
genes,  you  observe  that  this  SNP  is  located  within the  noncoding region  of G  ene  D.  However,  it s  till 
changes the  sequence  of  the  protein  encoded  by  Gene  D.   Provide  an  explanation  that supports  this  
observation.

Question 1 continued
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  the PCR  reaction, you need a  three- step  reaction  cycle, which  results  in a  chain  reaction  that
iii.	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
produces  an  exponentially  growing  population  of  identical  DNA  molecules.  Each  step  of  a 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reaction cycle is performed at a specific temperature i.e. 94oC for Step 1, 60oC for step 2 and 72oC 
for Step 3.  Briefly explain why the three steps are performed under different temperatures.

iv.	  When  PCR  amplification  is  used  to  provide  a  specific DNA  fragment  for  cloning,  the  resulting
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clones  are  sequenced  to  make  sure  that  inserts  have  the  correct  base  sequence.  What  activity
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
does  Taq  DNA  polymerase  enzyme  lack  that  may  explain  the  errors  that  occur  during  PCR
 
amplification? 

 
 
 

  
  
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 
 
 
 
Question 2
 
 
You need a large amount of Protein D encoded by Gene D. Therefore you decide to engineer a mouse
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cell line that will secrete a large amount of Protein D, so that you can purify Protein D  from the
 
medium. Note:  A cell line is a single type of cell, which continuously grows in culture. 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a) List any four components, of the host eukaryotic cell translation machinery, which are absolutely 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
required for synthesis of proteins, and briefly (few words) indicate what each does. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) List two components, of the host eukaryotic cell translation machinery, which are absolutely 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
required for export of Protein D from the cell? 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) You isolate a cDNA for Gene D. However, when you transfect the normal cell line with a vector
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
containing Gene D (i.e. insert a vector containing Gene D into the cells), you find that Protein D is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
produced in the cytoplasm but not secreted. You conclude that something is therefore wrong with the
 
 
Gene D. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.	  What modifications would you make to the cDNA for Gene D that would plausibly allow

 
  
 
 
 
Protein D to be secreted? 
 

 

 

ii.

iii.	  Assuming your manipulation in part (i) is successful, would the modified/secreted version of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Protein D be of the same size, larger than, smaller than its unmodified/cytoplasmic version?

d) Interestingly, you find that this protein, when secreted, can bind to either of following cell
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
membrane receptors (Receptor 1 and Receptor 2). The transmembrane domains (TD) and the signal

Question 3
You have identified an enzyme  (E1) in a yeast strain (Strain 1) that catalyzes a step in a biochemical
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pathway, which results in the synthesis of the amino acid Arginine. This enzyme is encoded by Gene 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A. You isolate Gene A from the yeast cells, clone it into a plasmid vector and amplify it in the bacterial 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
cells. 
 
a) List the minimum features that a plasmid vector must have to allow the cloning and amplification of

d) You grow and amplify the recombinant plasmid in the bacterial cells. You then purify the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
recombinant plasmid from the bacterial cells and transform the yeast cells with it. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.	  Why did you use the bacterial cells only for the amplification of the plasmid but NOT for the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
expression of Gene A?

Question 4
Individuals who are homozygous for the mutation in Gene A  (genotype = aa) suffer from a liver
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disease that shows an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. You decide to do a UROP in a lab that 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is dedicated to using gene therapy to cure this hereditary disorder, in a mouse model. 
  
 
a) Using virus as a vector that stably integrates into the genome of the host cell, you introduce a wild-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
type allele of Gene A in the liver cells of newborn mice whose genotype is “aa”. If all cell types  of the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mouse have roughly the same genome why would you use only the liver cells to introduce the wild-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
type allele of Gene A?

Question 4 continued
b) Based on what you have learnt in 7.013 lectures why is the ex-vivo gene therapy more successful 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
than the in- vivo gene therapy? Give one reason. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) Your supervisor suggests that you use embryonic cells instead of liver cells for ex-vivo gene therapy.
Explain what may be the potential advantage of using embryonic cells compared to the liver cells. 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d) You isolate embryonic cells from an affected mouse (genotype: aa) and infect them with a viral
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vector that has a wild- type allele of Gene A. You select the cells that have been infected with the virus 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
containing the wild- type copy of Gene A and re-introduce them into the developing embryo of the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
affected mouse to obtain newborns. You trace the location and expression of Gene A in the newborn
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mice by adding a blue color dye that specifically binds to the protein encoded by Gene A. You obtain
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the following two sets of results. Note: You may assume that the level of expression of the Gene A correlates
   
with the intensity of the blue color in the cells. In wild-type mice, the dye stains only the liver cells. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•	  Set 1:  When you add the dye you find that most of cells in the mouse, including the liver cells, turn blue. 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•	  Set 2:  Based on the results of Set 1, you modify your viral vector that contains Gene A, reinsert it into the
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
embryonic cells and obtain newborns by following the same steps that were described above. When you add
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the dye you find that only the liver cells turn blue and the color is of the same intensity as in the liver cells 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
of wild-type mice.  In addition, these mice do not show the manifestations of the disease. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How did you modify the viral vector so that the introduced Gene A was expressed only in the liver
 
 
 
 
cells of newborns obtained in Set 2? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
e) You isolate the cell from a developing embryo (at the blastula stage/ 8– cell stage) that is produced
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by the fusion of gametes from affected parents (genotype: aa).  You infect these cells with a modified 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vector from Set 2 that has a wild type copy of Gene A. You then select the cells that have undergone
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
homologous recombination and now have a wild-type copy of Gene A. You re-introduce them into the 
 
 
 
 
 
developing embryo (genotype: aa) to obtain newborns. 
  
 
i.	  Give all the possible genotypes of the newborn obtained from this strategy? Briefly explain why 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
you selected this genotype. Note: Use the uppercase A to represent the allele responsible for the dominant
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phenotype and lowercase a to represent the allele responsible for the recessive phenotype. 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 

 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

ii.	  You allow the newborn obtained from the strategy outlined above to mate with a wild- type
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
female mouse (genotype: AA). Would you expect all the mice from this mating experiment to 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have a normal phenotype (Yes/ No)? Explain why you selected this option.
