the article i found most appealing and pertinent was the 'slow technology' paper by 
researchers at the interactive institute in sweden. i sympathize with the motivation behind 
their work; namely, technology that may not be wholly instanteously gratifying, where 
you 'get it' not upon immediate use but with extensive and patient degrees of time. the 
flashy demo + gadgety stuff superficially impresses people, rather than changes their 
perspectives in interesting and unpredictable ways. can we look to nature for the beauty 
in slow, reflective processes? seasons change gradually [a harsh winter particularly seems 
to last forever], yet with each passing year we cry, 'where did all the time go?' there exists 
a pervasive trend in our culture that looks speedily forward but never stops to treasure the 
present. technology, with all its power, seems to be primarily utilized to compress time 
unnaturally, spinning into a perpetual catch 22; i hope that we can balance it out with 
technology that expands time poetically and artistically. as we appreciate more the 
everyday tasks and tools, the easily-forgotten yet inarguably-deep associations between 
ourselves and other people and places garner authenticity and significance.  

prof. ishii's philosophy manifests itself in seamless computing, where the world becomes 
the environmental interface, in line with mark weiser's vision of true ubiquitous 
computing. however, many of the research projects within tmg deal with highly specific 
task-based tools, harnessed to a flat, finite tabletop augmented with tagged phicons, a 
projected image, and various cameras and sensors. although touching actual objects has 
its tangible satisfaction, the table interfaces still seem very much two-dimensional, 
digitally expressed, and artificially implemented. however, i applaud the non-table 
projects, such as topobo, comtouch, and the i/o brush. tangible media seems to be most 
favorably effective when the technology becomes incorporated within, not augmented 
upon, the physical affordances of the object. 

the 'guidelines' to designing ambient interfaces by gross seems like a helpful rubric for 
evaluating a design. however, depending on so many factors such as use, intent, and 
context, many of the standards could be completely subjective. how does one judge

utility? or consistency? a lot of the slow technology philosophy runs counter to this 
'efficient computing' setup of standards.
