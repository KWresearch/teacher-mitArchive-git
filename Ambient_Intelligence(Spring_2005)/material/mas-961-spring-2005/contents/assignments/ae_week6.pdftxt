Week 6 

+I would have liked to have seen more information about the systems and techniques the 
developers of these user-modeling shells were using, just to get a sense of how well their 
strategies lend themselves to the systems they designed (and how complex the resulting 
systems are). Right now, these shells are just described as a bunch of abstractions with 
slightly different capabilities and with no real purpose given beyond market research. I 
did, however, appreciate the list of the typical characteristics of these systems, since it 
reveals the common design decisions that apparently had to be made. (And on the note of 
wanting to see more information – what sort of failover strategies might a user-modeling 
system have?) 

+There are more applications of user-modeling beyond market research, and it would 
have been nice to see more specific (or more in-depth) examples of those applications 
presented in this paper. 

+I also would have liked to have seen more information on how the developers of these 
shells intended to handle privacy issues? They don’t address the issue much in this 
reading, but what happens when all of the usage data – and the assumptions about their 
future usage, if those have been made by the system – is compromised? 

+There seemed to be a good representation of systems that directly obtained information 
from the user regarding their preferences vs systems that observed and made “educated 
guesses” listed in this reading. I would have liked to have seen which ones were 
considered more successful…and whether these “stereotypes” that almost everyone 
seems to make use of were really the best way to approach the problem. Does the 
existence of these stereotypes skew data? How often are they updated? How user-friendly 
is the system that a person could manually change the system’s assumptions about them, 
and how direct is the system’s methods for gathering this data in the first place? 

+I think the projected future of these systems is interesting, but again, they raise the issue 
of privacy. When a user-modeling agent is able to follow the user around (courtesy of 
ubicom, I suppose?) where does one draw the line when it comes to data-gathering? And 
again, how public is this data going to be?
