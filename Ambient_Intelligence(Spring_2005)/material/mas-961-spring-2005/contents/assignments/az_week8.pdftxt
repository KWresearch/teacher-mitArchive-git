Week 8 Critique 

Augmented Reality: A New Way of Seeing, Steven K. Feiner, 2002  

For the most part this article is a review on what I already knew (its very general), so I 
suppose I'll keep my comments general. As this article pointed out, many of the current 
challenges of AR are a matter of technology getting the price, accuracy, and size of 
hardware down. At least we know that its guaranteed to work in that direction, but we'll 
see how long it is before AR could become a true global reality. I was quite impressed by 
the potential of centimeter-level GPS accuracy, but as the author pointed out this is not 
practical for most setups. This is where I think work on using WiFi? or even better 
WiMax? could have better coverage, as noted by projects like Intel's PlaceLab?.  

But even assuming I can get all of that built into my glasses, I wonder where the 
platforms could go. There are many obvious applications (what have already been 
worked on), but I'm curious to see what gets adapted and what worked. Sophisticated 
algorithms for object recognition and context-awareness need to be developed 
SIGNIFICANTLY if AR is to be generalized at all outside of a boeing factory (and 
probably needs to be there as well). When it comes to obstructing vision, I worry that bad 
results can occur even if alpha-blended with bad timing and poor design. My guess is that 
its use will be more domain-specific and less general purpose.  

As much as I'd like to have information crawling all over the place, I think its quite easy 
to reach emotional overload if used daily. I would imagine taking off the glasses would 
feel akin to taking off shoes after a lot of walking. Proper design must make sure that AR 
isn't used as a delivery platform because its neat, but rather it serves a unique mechanism 
that cannot be replicated. For example, the existence of AR would not be justified by 
alerting me of an email or SMS. Cell phones work well enough for that as is. Overlaying 
of information in organized ways that track objects to help reduce cognitive complexity 
(especially using spatial information to transform non-linear problems into linear 
complexity) do justify AR. In particular, AR would help situations where complicated 
and/or precise mechanical movements by a human are required (such as repair), but 
keeping state as well as potentially large knowledge-base requirements make it difficult 
for most (or available) people.
