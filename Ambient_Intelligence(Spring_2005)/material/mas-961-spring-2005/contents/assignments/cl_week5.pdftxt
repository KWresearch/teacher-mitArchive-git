Ubiquitous Computing, Weiser 1993  

Perspectives article for ACM Interactions, Weiser 1993  

The coming age of calm technology, Weiser & Seely Brown, 1996  

i'm deeply encouraged by mark weiser's vision of the ideal, information-rich interaction 
with our environment. i feel as though multiple machines and gadgets (and the pesky 
maintenance of such objects through power, memory, constant-carrying, etc) get the 
better of us, and the benefits to the technology are filtered through the clunky interface or 
division of attention. invisibility is paramount: i'd rather sit in a chair and have it 
automatically adjust to optimal comfort and configuration than fiddle with a lot of 
buttons and knobs; i'd like to be able to access what i need to see without having to attend 
to hundred other displays. periphery + the everyday seem to be the natural solution for 
our human perception to keep up.  

the three obstacles to true ubicomp that weiser ennumerates seem to still be extant: (1) 
great need for copious wireless bandwidth, (2) dealing with roaming issues and changing 
addresses for mobile devices, and (3) immobility of current windows systems. even 
though he writes this in 1993, 12 years later we're still suffering from difficulties. perhaps 
the situation is not so dire as it was back then, but the infrastructure for the seamless, 
controllable, always-at-hand technology is still lacking. therein lies the difficulty of HCI 
development: the user interfaces might be conceptually sound, but implementing them on 
PDAs or mobile phones or screens-on-random-surface gives a cursory spin on tired 
systems. what could be a useful way of exploring or researching ubicomp interfaces 
without being visibly hindered by technological hurdles? are there ways to overcome 
them by sharing spaces with other ubiquitous things like electricity or writing? 

i love his proposal of 'childhood' as the theme for the future of ubicomp. this really takes 
into account the emotional and sensory pleasure of good design, not merely informational 
overload or straight-forward tools for the tasks. we should have more delight in the 
everyday moments, incorporating discovery and pleasure into the necessary and 
purposeful.
