Common Sense Computing

Teaching machines
about how people work

• My goal is to build computing systems that have a 
deep grasp of human nature and the human world.
– Can understand, explain and predict human 
physical, social, and mental behavior.
– Use databases of commonsense knowledge and 
models of human psychology.
• At the Media Lab we are developing technologies to 
embed common sense in a broad range of software, 
devices, and environments — enabling new kinds of 
intelligent interfaces and applications.

Commonsense-based Applications

A cell phone that, although silenced, would know to ring if 
your mother were to call from the hospital.

A search engine that, when you entered “a gift for my 
baby brother,” would displays a list of children’s toys.

A personal digital assistant that would know to cancel a 
hiking trip with a friend who had broken their leg.

A camera that knew, on its own, to take a photo of your 
sister crossing the finish line at a marathon.

Commonsense-based Applications

- People who are badly hurt may go to the hospital.
- We want those we care about to be healthy.

- A gift should be something the recipient would like.
- Children like to play with toys.

- Hiking can be a relaxing activity.
- People with broken legs have difficulty walking.

- Cameras are for recording events people find significant.
- Crossing the finish line is an significant event.

Can we take a Wikipedia approach
to teaching machines common sense?

• We need to build commonsense databases with 
tens of millions of elements. How can we do this?

• Observation: Everyone has the common sense we 
want to give our machines.

• Can we build a system that learns from tens of 
thousands of ordinary people?

It must be full of a bunch of crank submissions, 
vandalism, and plain old sophomoric stupidity. 
But it's not. It's not half bad. In places, and 
increasingly, it's of very high quality. And that's 
even more paradoxical.

architecture for intelligence

Questions the architecture can ask itself:
What is the best thing for me to do now?
What will happen next following this event?
What would explain why this event occurred?
What can I learn from this failure?
What might go wrong while performing this action?
What could be it the negative consequences?
Why are they taking that action?
etc.

Conclusions
1. Using the web, we have been able to give computers a 
first cut at a broad-spectrum understanding of the 
human world.
2. We are searching for ways to use “messy” knowledge 
bases, e.g. using probabilistic representations.
3. We are connecting commonsense reasoning directly to 
the real world through sensory interfaces, to learn from 
and also to help interpret that sensory data.
4. We are developing cognitive architectures that are 
self-reflective and multi-representational, to try to 
achieve something closer to human-like thinking.
5. We are developing many applications based on these 
technologies. See Beating Common Sense into 
Interactive Applications (AI Magazine, Winter 2004).

how much does a person know?

• Can you estimate the number of…
– words you know and things you know about those words
– activities you are familiar with and their structures
– bodily postures you can get into and what you can do in them
– object appearances you can recognize from different angles
– layouts of typical places you know and what you can do there
– actions you can predict the effects of in different contexts
– functions various shaped objects serve
– goals you want to achieve–both large and small
– emotional states you enter and how they affect your thinking

•

It seems likely that the number is in at least the millions and 
possibly there are tens or even hundreds of millions of items of 
common sense.

The Challenge: Ambiguity
“the sky is blue”

You can always make things more precise. Does this mean…
… the sky is always blue?
… the sky is blue only sometimes (i.e. during the day)?
… the sky is mostly blue but has other colors?
… the sky is always blue but the things in it have other colors?

How can we reason with this kind of ambiguity?
do we need a more precise ontology under the hood?
can we learn the distribution of more precise meanings?
can contexts help disambiguate, as is done in NLP?
maybe we can leave representations ambiguous?
(ambiguous senses sometimes help by lending additional meaning)

Ambiguous representation involve fewer symbols and less syntactic 
complexity, and are simpler to think about. This makes building KBs
much easier, at the cost of their being harder to apply.

Understand the situation
- Watch what you do
- Listen to you speak
- Monitor sensors
- Read your blog

All systems
will come with
embedded 
common sense!

Take useful actions
- Acts on your behalf
- Suggests things to do
- Warns you of problems
- Remind you of things

What are you doing and why?
What can you do to achieve your goals?
Is there a better situation to be in this one?
What just happened and what might happen?
What might go wrong?
Could someone else help?

interpreting sensor data
using common sense

• Given a partial and raw sensory 
stream, we can try to interpret it at a 
higher level.
• One possible narrative explanation:
– person enters room
– person gathers ingredients
– person begins cooking
– person prepares ingredients
– person cooks those
– person gets knife
– etc.
• Using a maximum likelihood 
framework -- given observations, 
infer most likely high events.
