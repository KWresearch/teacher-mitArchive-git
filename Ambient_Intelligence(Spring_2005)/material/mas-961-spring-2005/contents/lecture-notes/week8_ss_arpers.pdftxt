Note

(cid:131) This is a paper about VR, but many of the points 
are valid and it provides a good intro to what is 
needed for such systems. These base 
requirements remains the same for AR, which is 
why I chose this paper. Also, I wanted to keep it 
short.

(cid:131) If you want to read 48 pages of EVERYTHING about 
AR, please refer to “A Survey of Augmented 
Reality” by Ronald T. Azuma

Perspectives on AR: Evolutionary

(cid:131) Build a better UI
(cid:131) Desktop is the primary interface mode right 
now
(cid:131) Good for documents and flat stuff
(cid:131) Not so good for 3D input or output
(cid:131) Humans are well designed for a 3D world
(cid:131) Taking the interface into 3D will benefit 
certain classes of applications

Perspective on AR: Revolutionary

(cid:131) Presence simulation itself is an interface 
metaphor
(cid:131) Build a new reality, providing a new way to work
(cid:131) Virtual prototyping and walkthroughs
(cid:131) Simulation based training
(cid:131) Telepresence and teleoperation
(cid:131) Generalized augmentation of everyday reality
(cid:131) Change the way the work is done at a very low 
level

Short History

(cid:131) 60’s-70’s: Origin with teleoperation systems
(cid:131) 1980’s: MIT creates first limited 3D workspace
(cid:131) 1980’s: NASA picks up work, with focus on 
teleoperation
(cid:131) 1989: Autodesk and VPL Research demo VR in 
trade shows
(cid:131) VPL founder Jaron Lanier coins “Virtual Reality”
(cid:131) … and the rest is history

Necessities of AR/VR

(cid:131) Multiple/integrated input and output modalities
(cid:131) Functional fidelity: sensory cues must match task
(cid:131) Responsiveness
(cid:131) Affordances: maintain affordance needed to 
create illusion of presence in the perceived 
reality
(cid:131) Appeals to mental representation: recognizable by 
users through real-world metaphors

Requirements of VR/AR: Input

(cid:131) Simulated presence requires allowance for all 
normal modes of interaction with reality
(cid:131) Full body gesture/position/locomotion sensing is 
the holy grail
(cid:131) In reality, only a few of the possible channels are 
captured
(cid:131) Gesture and voice come in second to position
(cid:131) Guesture/locomotion is sampled at critical 
points and rest of data is interpolated

Output: Visual

(cid:131) Human eyes have a horizontal FoV of ~180 
degrees without motion
(cid:131) The sensitivity drops greatly, but peripheral 
view is needed for sense of realism
(cid:131) Maximum accuracy id defined by size of fovea, 
with resolution of 0.5 arc minutes (0.008°)
(cid:131) Minimum motion update rate is ~15 Hz, below 
which the brain no longer interpolates motion
(cid:131) For high motion content simulations, >60Hz is 
often necessary

Output: Aural

(cid:131) Hearing is not as privileged as vision, but 
necessary for situational awareness
(cid:131) Dynamic sensitivity is max between 1 and 4 kHz
(cid:131) Azimuth (left vs. right) perception is generally 
good to one degree
(cid:131) Monaural levels are used for amplitude detection, 
which is often mapped to distance using rate of 
change

Output: Haptic

(cid:131) Haptic senses are combined sensory and motor 
systems
(cid:131) Basic idea is force feedback
(cid:131) Generally, there is a lack of techniques for 
simulating the haptic output without having a real 
object
(cid:131) In absense of this, stylized gestures are often used 
to replace fine haptic interaction
(cid:131) Update rates > 1kHz is needed to maintain realism

Key Issues: Synchronization

(cid:131) VR/AR often causes motion sickness
(cid:131) Key to this is the fact that one or more sensory 
subsystem is producing data which is not in 
synchronization with either the other sensory 
systems, or not matching previous experience 
with the same conditions
(cid:131) Each sense has its own detection threshold
(cid:131) Overall tolerance of variation is generally very 
low

Hardware issues

(cid:131) Covered in other presentation

Guidelines/Comments

(cid:131) Iterative/user-centric design is key when using a 
new methodology
(cid:131) There are no toolkits to abstract away the UI 
issues
(cid:131) Synchronization of this sort requires parallel 
programming techniques
(cid:131) Latency is especially jarring and should be 
carefully considered
(cid:131) There are new problems such as occlusions
(cid:131) 2D display techniques often do not apply
(cid:131) This is still a lot about technology and basis
(cid:131) Set reasonable goals for the points to be made 
today
