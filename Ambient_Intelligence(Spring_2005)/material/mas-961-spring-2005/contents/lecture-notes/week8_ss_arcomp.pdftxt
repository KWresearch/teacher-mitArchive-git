Excerpts from the Abstracts

(cid:131) “Archaeological excavations produce vast amounts 
of data that have an inherent three-dimensional 
character. We hypothesize that providing 
archaeologists with an immersive virtual 
environment in which he or she has total access to 
all these data, in its original context, will allow 
them to perform, not only simple walkthroughs 
over the site, but complex analyses on the 
recovered data.”
(cid:131) “We focus on augmenting existing archaeological 
analysis methods with new ways to organize, 
visualize, and combine the standard 2D 
information available from an excavation 
(drawings, pictures, and notes) with … 3D models 
of objects and the site itself.”

ARCHAVE Interesting points

(cid:131) Creation of a VR/AR model requires by definition 
a set of choices to be made
(cid:131) These choices may be interpretive
(cid:131) The sense of the site may be altered by the 
model’s projection of the data
(cid:131) VR/AR is what it is because it a model of reality, 
not reality itself, and has its own weaknesses and 
strengths

Methodology

(cid:131) Visualizes Great Temple of Petra site excavations 
(cid:131) Started with block coloring the 3D structures by # 
of finds
(cid:131) Too little information
(cid:131) Attempt to use GIS methods
(cid:131) Insufficient fexibility in existing packages
(cid:131) Create new visualizations using see-through walls 
and utilize the physical clustering of objects as 
the metric
(cid:131) Most successful: encompasses design goals

(cid:131) Lesson: further from a recipe than usual GUI 
design

Capabilities

(cid:131) Uses translucent walls model
(cid:131) Allows interaction thru cursor and glove (select 
motion only)
(cid:131) Allows queries against database of finds
(cid:131) Does not contain much metadata about finds

VITA Overview

(cid:131) Visualizes data from an Elymian acropolis (Sicily)
(cid:131) Data includes find location, images, and 
metadata, digital video and stills, laser range 
scans of location, panoramic images of site
(cid:131) Attempts to preserve the site in all its stages 
(cid:131) Goals: assisting data visualization and analysis, 
on-site field planning, and remote collaboration 
on the data
(cid:131) Does not use human modeling of 3D component

Methodology

(cid:131) Mixed multimodal environment
(cid:131) Uses tracked see-through HMD’s, touch sensitive 
projections, gesture, and speech
(cid:131) Navigation via world-in-miniature and full scale 
world modes
(cid:131) Can explore a 10x10m tile at a time
(cid:131) Panoramic backdrops can “fill in” periphery
(cid:131) 2D display and WiM allow temporal and spacial
navigation
(cid:131) A handheld active lens allows access to high 
resolution data
(cid:131) User-centric iterative design

User Reactions

(cid:131) 3D full scale projection complementary to 2D data 
traditionally available
(cid:131) Virtual model allows easy capture of different 
perspectives
(cid:131) Primary benefit was connecting temporal 
coordinates of objects with the 3D representation 
and related metadata of objects
(cid:131) Most wanted feature: time lapse visualization
(cid:131) Equipments is cumbersome, occludes normal body 
language
