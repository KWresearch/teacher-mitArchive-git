User Modeling, 
Recommender Systems & 
Personalization
Pattie Maes
MAS 961- Week 6

Recommender Systems:
General idea

User profile
(info about
user)

compare

Set of items

e.g. news articles, 
books, music, 
movies, products, …

Recommend items
user will like

Personalization: General Idea

Personalization = user adaptive systems

User profile

interaction is adapted based on 
data about an individual user 
Eg personal websites, 
personalized tutoring, 
personalized recommendations, 
etc.

Why relevant to this class?

Ambient Intelligence = 

Ubiquitous Computing
+
Intelligent Interfaces (eg personalization)

User Profile

simple

complex

• demographical info
– Age, gender, location, …
• Interests, preferences, expertise level, …
• Purchase records, observed behavior
• Ratings 
• …
• complete “lifelog”

Source of User Profile

• Entered explicitly by user (questionnaire)
• Gathered implicitly by system 
– Observing/recording person’s behavior
– Learning/inferring interests/preferences/level…
• Combination of both approaches

• Another dimension: public/private

Acquired User Profiles

Form: 
- raw data
- generalization (find patterns & generalize)
- statistical ML methods
- knowledge based ML methods
- keep both forms (to relearn/adapt over time)
- keep “window” of raw data

Generic User Modeling

• Separate user modeling from 
applications/use
– Reusable across applications
• Still mostly theory, not practice
• State of art: every application does its own 
user modeling specific to the task at hand

Recommendation algorithms

• Case-based/Stereotype based
• Feature-based/Content-based
• Collaborative Filtering

Case-Based/Stereotype-Based

• Acquire info about user
• Classify user in a bucket (as a particular “case” or 
stereotype) based on facts about user
– Eg soccer moms, poor grad student, … (there may be a 
hierarchy, rather than list of stereotypes)
• Certain assumptions about what appeals to a 
certain stereotype
– Eg which items appeal to certain case/category of users
• Recommend those to the user

• Example: demographics-based recommendations

Feature-based/Content-based 
Filtering
• One approach: learning from item examples
– Look at all items a user likes
• Features of items
– Find patterns among items and generalize (often also 
involves clustering)
– Then recommend more items that fit same pattern(s)

– Eg recommend movies based on features of those 
movies (genre, actors, …)

Feature-based/Content-based 
Filtering
• Another approach: learning stereotypes from user 
examples 
– Given a category of items 
– Given set of users with features & values
– Given information on which users like what items
– Generalize on what types of users like a category of 
items
– Recommend items based on what case user falls into

Knowledge-based Techniques

• Special case of feature-based where 
background knowledge of item space or 
user space is used to generalize

• Eg use ConceptNet or Interest Map
– Know what people are related (InterestMap)
– Know what items are related (ConceptNet)

Collaborative Filtering

users

items

Sparse matrix of ratings (or purchase patterns)

Algorithms: recommend items based on item similarities (rows) or
based on user similarities (colums), typically weighted average of K 
nearest neighbors, with weight inverse proportional to distance

Pros & Cons different techniques

• Collaborative filtering
– Pros:
• Does not require analysis of the items (features)
• Better at qualitative judgements
– Cons: 
• Bootstrapping
• Ratings required
• Critical mass required

Mixed Techniques

• Use ratings as additional features in the 
generalization task
– ML algorithm can learn what features are best 
predictors (content features or ratings by others 
or both)

User Profile

• Short term information
– Eg current context, current activity/focus
• Long term info
– Eg longer term interests
• You typically want to use both
• Update them on different timescale

Location of  User Profile

• Centralized
– Generic
– Device & application independent
– Easier to apply generalization across users
• Distributed 
– Mobile use
– Better privacy
• Mixed forms

Tunnel vision problem & 
importance of serendipity

• Feedback loop: 
– Systems recommends items of type X
– User consumes items of type X
• Importance of “exploration” or 
“serendipity” (recommending items outside 
user’s interest space)

Avoiding the tunnel vision 
problem

Highlight 
recommendations 
but present all 
choices

Other problems

• Noisy/incorrect data used in user modeling
– User needs to be able to inspect & “correct”
user model
• Trust
– Recommendation system needs transparency!!
• Privacy
• Control

Variant: one person as 
recommender

• E.g. see world through Marvin’s eyes
• Have a famous critic as your guide
