user is involved in
(cid:132) To change interaction of user with

Hanging Messages – Emily 
Chang, 2001

Motivation
(cid:132) Current messaging systems
– only recipient(s) are specified, no 
context
(cid:132) Many messages are context-driven
– appropriate during a certain time period
– most useful delivered to certain 
location
(cid:132) More context helps prevent 
information overload
– sender’s judgment is incorporated

How Is It Useful?
(cid:132) Requests to friends/colleagues
– “Can you pick up a book at the 
library…”
(cid:132) Informative notices
– construction information
– crime bulletins
(cid:132) Personal reminders
– “Don’t forget to drop off registration 
forms…”
(cid:132) Promotion distribution

Research Focus: Agent 
Filtering
(cid:132) Filtering mechanisms
– message categories
– active and passive messages
– user profiles
– known sender list
– multiple modes with separate profiles
(cid:132) Goal: no user should be bothered by 
unwanted or unsolicited messages

Message Categories

(cid:132) Every message belongs 
to a category
(cid:132) Senders can select a 
category when sending a 
message
(cid:132) The recipient’s agent can 
override the sender’s 
choice of category
(cid:132) Filtering can be done by 
category

Etherthreads: An Infrastructure 
for Location-based Messaging, Brad 
Lassey 2004

Location is an important 
contextual clue
Scenarios
Walking tour of Boston
Restaurant reviews
Reminders
Organizational Memory

How to get Location

GPS
Approximately 10m – 30m  resolution
Works essentially anywhere in the world
Does not work indoors
E911 and other cell sensing technologies
Resolution on the order a mile
Dependant of service provider
Not widely available at the present
Sensor networks: IR and RF
Require additional infrastructure

Sensor network based 
solutions

Technologies
Infrared
Radio frequency
Sonic
Measurement techniques
Time delay
Phase shift
Signal Strength

Etherthreads implementation

Phone makes connection to at least three 
Bluetooth beacons
Beacons serve requests for connection statistics
Signal Strength (RSSI)
Link Quality (a measure of interference)
Total Power Level
Phone uses statistics to determine location
Beacons then serve application specific requests

Messaging Application

Messages stored on a central 
server
SQL Database
Beacon servers make queries to 
the SQL server

Threads

Messages organized in threads
Threads embody
Subject matter
Set of senders
Set of Receivers

Functionality

(cid:132) The user is tracked with GPS.

(cid:132) A behaviour-learning agent determines the salient 
locations in the user's life.

(cid:132) Messages or reminders can be sent to these 
prominent virtual locations. For example, "home", 
"work", "grocery store", "Grandma's".

(cid:132) The user will only receive the specific message 
when in the relevant context (physical location, 
time and date).

Functionality (cont.)

(cid:132) Once the behaviour-learning agent has 
established virtual locations and mobility 
patterns, it can start pushing information to the 
user, such as: 
the latest traffic report when leaving "home" on the way 
–
to "work“
– on a Friday evening after leaving "work", the agent 
might get the movies playing at the local cinema.
(cid:132) Based on GPS 
(cid:132) speech-based I/O as well as graphical I/O option

M-views: Mobile Cinema, 
Pengkai Pan 2001

(cid:132) PDA with 802.11 based location 
awareness
(cid:132) Streams movie segments based 
on location & time of day
(cid:132) 3 movies made & tested
(cid:132) M-studio: authoring & story 
scripting tool for mobile movies  

Example m-movie: Another 
Alice 

(cid:132) Mystery, user is investigator
(cid:132) There are a number of characters that can be 
followed throughout the story. 
(cid:132) The viewer must literally go to the location where 
the next clip takes place in order to trigger 
playback. 
(cid:132) Each character is telling the story from his/her 
perspective, each narration is different. 
(cid:132) The viewer can go back and play the story again, 
following a different character until the entire plot 
is revealed. 

Example m-movie: Another 
Alice

(cid:132) Time is a limiting factor. The viewer must 
get from one location to another within a 
certain time frame in order to catch a 
particular ending of the story. 
(cid:132) If the viewer does not make it to the 
location in time, a different ending is 
shown. Therefore, while the creator 
initiates the story, it is the viewer who 
completes it through his/her actions.

Task Assistance - Pattie

– Activity recognition & just in time 
assistance
– Example: counter-active project –
Wendy Ju et al

Counter Active, Wendy Ju, 
2000

(cid:132) The interface: a computer, an overhead 
projector, and electric field sensing array
(cid:132) by touching the pictures and words on the 
countertop, users can step their way 
through recipes. 
(cid:132) an event detection system enables a non-
command interface. An array of sensors 
distributed the kitchen can infer what 
events are occuring in the kitchen and 
respond before the user formulates an 
explicit command.

Discussion topics

(cid:132) Pros & cons of context-based 
systems
(cid:132) State of the art
(cid:132) Other applications of context-
based systems

Pros & cons of 
context-based systems

(cid:132) Pros:
– More immediate access to relevant info
– “in situ intelligence augmentation”
(cid:132) Cons: 
– System makes assumptions about (1) 
what the context is and (2) what info 
may be relevant
– Limits to how much common sense 
systems can have

State of the art in Context-
aware systems

(cid:132) Have we only scratched the 
surface?
(cid:132) What are hardest problems to be 
addressed?

based systems
