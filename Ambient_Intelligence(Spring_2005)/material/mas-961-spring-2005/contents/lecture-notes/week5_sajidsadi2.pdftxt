Overview

(cid:131) Discusses some of the physical issues concerning 
ubicomp
(cid:131) Hardware aspects of creating devices that 
disappear, yet occur plentifully in environment

Computers and People

(cid:131) “…people primarily work in a world of shared 
situations and unexamined technological skills…”
(cid:131) Computers today make things worse
(cid:131) Unlike a regular tool, it consumes attention
(cid:131) Attempting to have the system act more human 
simply legitimizes this issue

Problem of Paradigm

(cid:131) The problem is not in the GUI in itself
(cid:131) Attention-centric design is part of affordance
(cid:131) Also not a limit of capabilities in data handling or 
multimedia

(cid:131) Problem exists in the relationship around which 
computers today are designed

Inspiration

(cid:131) To be a part of the physical world of the user, the 
object should be like other physical objects in 
existence
(cid:131) Devices should use real-world communication 
metaphors, instead of attempting to transplant to 
virtual world
(cid:131) Led to the tab/pad/board design, and ended 
there (effectively)
(cid:131) Quantizes the information chunks into sizes 
that map perhaps to talks or subtasks

Hardware

(cid:131) ParcTAB
(cid:131) PDA-like
(cid:131) Low bandwidth and processing, small display
(cid:131) Main concern: battery life (~ 1 week)
(cid:131) Pad family
(cid:131) Essentially unix-enabled tablet PC’s
(cid:131) Custom hardware allows approximately same 
capability as today’s tablets, scaling for 
improvements in semiconductors

Hardware and Software

(cid:131) Design chips that use less voltage and more 
surface
(cid:131) Design for reducible clock rates
(cid:131) Use small cell-based near-field radios, with r6
falloff to allow many cells in one building
(cid:131) Wireless handshake-based collision detection
(cid:131) QoS over wireless
(cid:131) Distributed caching and cache sharing

Apps for Ubicomp

(cid:131) Shared interaction space
(cid:131) Particularly, shared drawing
(cid:131) Cotemporaneous with ClearBoard
(cid:131) Also, collaborative filtering of content
(cid:131) Locating people
(cid:131) Using active badges
(cid:131) Using logins (even to tabs…)
(cid:131) Automatic call forwarding
(cid:131) People maps

Privacy Issues

(cid:131) Decentralize data storage to end nodes
(cid:131) Personal computers hold actual data
(cid:131) User specifies access criteria
(cid:131) Location data – inherently part of the cellular 
design
(cid:131) In decentralized model, user is the atom
(cid:131) Profiling individuals
(cid:131) Obvious concerns
(cid:131) Most benefits
(cid:131) Conflict with allowing outside access to 
location data

Summary

(cid:131) User studies are critical to success
(cid:131) Hardware and software is only substrate to the 
actual work

(cid:131) Ubicomp should augment the user within the 
natural context, instead of being a mere tool
