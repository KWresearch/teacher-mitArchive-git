Hardware Overview

(cid:131) Tends to focus on cutting edge hardware
(cid:131) Very computationally intensive
(cid:131) Core issues: hardware is not really ready for wide 
scale deployment

Location

(cid:131) Tends to be one of the primary problems in AR/VR
(cid:131) Each sensor technology has limitations
(cid:131) Currently no high-granularity, high-spread, wide 
area sensing technologies available
(cid:131) Limits deployment
(cid:131) Increases number of sensors needed for fidelity
(cid:131) Area of study: sensor fusion systems

Position sensors

(cid:131) Minimum requirement is generally 3 degrees of 
freedom (DOF): x, y, z
(cid:131) Higher DOF is simulated with multiple 3DOF 
sensors + constraints
(cid:131) 6DOF sensors also available

Position: IR/Visual

(cid:131) Line of sight tracking, 3DOF by nature
(cid:131) Can be quite accurate, and can track many points
(cid:131) Often requires targets
(cid:131) Minimal on-body equipment
(cid:131) Can be cheap
(cid:131) Low marginal cost of added tracked points
(cid:131) Available in larger full motion capture setups

Position: Ultrasonic

(cid:131) Now available in wireless
(cid:131) Accurate, but sensitive to sonic reflection (many 
things reflect ultrasound)
(cid:131) Requires more extensive setup for precision
(cid:131) Small on-body devices needed
(cid:131) Can track 6DOF with added gyros or 
accelerometers
(cid:131) InterSense makes a lot of them in various 
geometries

Position: Intertial

(cid:131) Usually used with other tracker systems
(cid:131) Gives +3DOF (yaw, pitch, tilt), usually in 
conjunction with  3DOF position sensing
(cid:131) Often used to track head orientation
(cid:131) InterSense makes these too to go with ultrasonic 
tracking

Position: Magnetic

(cid:131) 3DOF or 6DOF trackers
(cid:131) Quite precise
(cid:131) Uses magnetic field for tracking, which may affect 
other systems
(cid:131) Sensitive to ferrous substances in range
(cid:131) Requires on-body receiver, often wired (wireless 
versions are starting to come out)
(cid:131) Expensive, high marginal cost of added points
(cid:131) Ascension and Polhemus are the final word

Position: Others

(cid:131) GPS
(cid:131) Differential indoor GPS
(cid:131) Field sensors of various sorts
(cid:131) Electric field sensing
(cid:131) Radio field sensing

Displays: HMD

(cid:131) Fully immersive or See-through HMD
(cid:131) Resolution between 800x600 and 1024x768
(cid:131) Fairly costly
(cid:131) ~2-6 lbs
(cid:131) ~90-120 degrees FoV
(cid:131) New technology: retinal display from 
MicroVision (Nomad)
(cid:131) Sharp display from light, small device
(cid:131) No colorâ€¦

Cave-type

(cid:131) Projected on walls of a room
(cid:131) Generally used with HMD to give higher resolution 
backplane
(cid:131) Can be stereoscopic

Other devices

(cid:131) Finger tracking gloves for gesture detection
(cid:131) Full body motion capture suits
(cid:131) Speech recognizers
(cid:131) Touch sensors for real world objects
(cid:131) Touch sensitive surfaces (ie, Mitsubishi 
DiamondTouch)

Techniques

(cid:131) All the usual aspects of user interface design, 
except with the viewpoint able to move in 6D
(cid:131) 3d rendering
(cid:131) Viewpoint detection
(cid:131) View-based information filtering
(cid:131) Adaptive labeling
(cid:131) Object and scene registration
(cid:131) Gesture disambiguation/multimodal input
(cid:131) Multiple view synchronization
(cid:131) Lag reduction tricks
