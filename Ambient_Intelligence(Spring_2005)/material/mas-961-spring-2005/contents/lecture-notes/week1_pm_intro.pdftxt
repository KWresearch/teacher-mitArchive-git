MAS 961 - Ambient Intelligence

Pattie Maes

Ambient Intelligence: Vision

(cid:132) Ambient Intelligence envisions a world where people 
are surrounded by intelligent and intuitive interfaces 
embedded in the everyday objects around them. 
These interfaces recognize and respond to the 
presence and behavior of an individual in a 
personalized and relevant way. 

Merging of different bodies of work

(cid:132) Ubiquitous Computing
(cid:132) Intelligent Interfaces
(cid:132) Context-aware Computing

Some Scenarios (1)

(cid:132) Ambient semantics (H. Liu) 
“enriching your every day experience”
(cid:132) Book tells you about friends/famous people that read/loved 
it
(cid:132) Book tells you about particularly interesting passages
(cid:132) Touching 2 books makes their connections appear

Some Scenarios (2)

(cid:132) Objects with memory
(cid:132) Readwear/writewear
(cid:132) Objects that act as medium for messages
(cid:132) Objects that can tell you their relevant stories/history

Some Scenarios (3)

(cid:132) Augmented physical environments
(cid:132) Walking around town, system points out buildings/places of 
particular interest to a user (based on user’s interests)
(cid:132) Books on a bookshelf can “speak out” to you (or posters in 
infinite corridor)

Vision (continued)

(cid:132) Ambient Intelligence Technology is:
(cid:132) “Invisible”:
(cid:132) Use/functions are immediately apparent
(cid:132) Ubiquitous:
(cid:132) Available anywhere, integrated in physical environment 
& objects around us
(cid:132) Intelligent:
(cid:132) Relevant to user & context-aware
(cid:132) Unobtrusive
(cid:132) Providing meaning (vs. knowledge vs. information)

Vision (continued)

(cid:132) Radically rethink the human-computer interactive 
experience:
(cid:132) Integrate digital world (information & services) and physical 
world (physical objects/environment)
(cid:132) Make interfaces more responsive and proactive (objects & 
environment monitor user and (proactively) present 
information & services relevant to user’s current 
needs/interests)

Challenges

(cid:132) Augment objects/environments with sensing, 
computing & networking capability
(cid:132) Sense & model the user’s behavior (offline/online) 
(cid:132) Infer the user’s current interests/intentions
(cid:132) Design (proactive) interfaces that offer value without 
being obnoxious, while being highly relevant
(cid:132) Integrate these interfaces in user’s physical 
environment in seamless, natural way:              
(cid:132) On the body: cell phones, wearables
(cid:132) In the environment: architecture, ether, objects

Goals for this Course

(cid:132) Provide an overview of this new vision for HCI
(cid:132) Read and discuss the most relevant articles in related areas: 
Smart Environments, Smart Networked Objects, Augmented & 
Mixed Realities, Ubiquitous Computing, Pervasive Computing, 
Tangible Computing, Intelligent Interfaces, Context-based 
Systems, Personalization and Wearable Computing. 
(cid:132) Focus on understanding enabling technologies and studying 
applications and experiments. To a lesser extend address the
socio-cultural impact. 
(cid:132) Come up with new ideas, start innovative projects in this area

How does this class differ from related 
Media Lab classes?

(cid:132) Hiroshi Ishii’s “Tangible Interfaces”
(cid:132) Giving physical form to digital information so that it 
becomes more easily manipulable and perceivable
(cid:132) Joe Paradiso’s “Sensor Technologies for Interactive 
Environments”
(cid:132) Focus on sensor technologies (& performance/events)
(cid:132) Ted Selker’s “, Context-Aware Computing”
(cid:132) Focus on context-aware systems in general (desktop as 
well as ubiquitous systems)

Requirements for the students

(cid:132) Students are required to participate extensively in 
literature research and class discussions
(cid:132) Read required readings ahead of class & prepare ½ page of 
questions & interesting points for discussion
(cid:132) Review & present +- 3 papers in class
(cid:132) Write 1 short “scenarios” paper (by Class 3)
(cid:132) Suggest additional papers to read
(cid:132) Suggest experiments & technologies to look at
(cid:132) Students are required to design and implement an
original project in this area and describe their 
project in a 3-page paper as well as make 2

Hanging Messages – Emily Chang (2001)

Using PDA + GPS, 
users can leave or 
receive location-
based messages

Project “Touch & Play”: 
Accessing information and services related to objects
– Assaf Feldman & Sajid Sadi

(cid:132) Touching an object results in a menu of services and 
information being presented on a nearby display
(cid:132) E.g. touching a book, results in options to:
(cid:132) Buy a copy of that book
(cid:132) Read reviews of that book
(cid:132) Leave a message in that book
(cid:132) Retrieve messages left in the book
(cid:132) Do a keyword search in the book
(cid:132) …

Wireless RFID reader wristband 
used in Ambient Semantics project
- Assaf Feldman, Sajid Sadi, Emmanuel Munguia
Tapia

RFID tags 
embedded 
in objects 
are read by 
a wireless
RFID reader 
wristband.

Project “Ambient Semantics”: 
Personalized information gems about 
object you currently focus on
- Hugo Liu, Assaf Feldman, Sajid Sadi (current)

(cid:132) Example: when you pick up a book, a 
nearby display shows:
(cid:132) Prediction of how much you will like it
(cid:132) which passages are relevant to your interests
(cid:132) how it relates to other books you recently read
(cid:132) who of your friends loved/hated it
(cid:132) …

Project “Ambient Semantics”: 
Personalized “information gems”
about the person you currently focus on
- Hugo Liu, Assaf Feldman, Sajid Sadi (current)

(cid:132) Example: shaking someone’s hand, a 
nearby display shows:
(cid:132) which interests you  have in common
(cid:132) which friends you have in common
(cid:132) which objects/locations you have in common

“Intelligence” methods 
used in Ambient Semantics project
- Hugo Liu (current)

(cid:132) Mining the web:
(cid:132) people’s homepages
(cid:132) social networks sites (Friendster, LinkedIn, 
Orkut)
(cid:132) Amazon & Google 
(cid:132) Using Natural Language Processing techniques 
and Common Sense knowledge
(cid:132) To find relevant connections (between 2 people, 
between person & object)

Project “Attentive Devices”: 
Sensing & responding to visual focus of attention
- David Merrill (current)

- User wears baseball cap with IR emitter/receiver
- Augmented (parts of) objects in environment  sense the 
user’s focus of attention
- Relevant & personalized information is presented in 
audio format 

Project “Object Awareness”:
Drawing the person’s attention to objects of interest in the 
immediate environment
- David Gatenby (current)

(cid:132) Bluetooth-enabled cell phone 
communicates user’s interests to 
augmented objects in user’s vicinity 
(cid:132) Relevant objects can draw the user’s 
attention by blinking their LED’s

Functions:
-Keyword search
-Recommendations
-Similarities
-Finding an object…

Ether Threads 
- Brad Lassey (2004)

(cid:132) Infrastructure for annotating the physical world 
(leaving location-specific messages) 
(cid:132) Threads and filtering mechanisms
(cid:132) Can be used as personal or collective 
“distributed memory”

Blue-tooth and GPS 
data trigger location-
based messages 
relevant to the user & 
thread s/he is 
interested in

What Would they Think?
- Hugo Liu (2003)

panel of 
mentors react 
proactively to 
text that a 
reader is 
currently 
viewing/writing
(speaking) 

Automated Annotation of 
Photographs  - Dan Relihan (2004)

Phone Camera 
communicates with 
GPS device via 
bluetooth to record 
location of picture 
taken. Phone 
interfaces to 
www.metacarta.com to 
find urls about that 
location. Extracts and 
offers keywords for 
the picture taken (to 
be edited by the user).

Aesthetiscope
- Hugo Liu (2004)

Impact

(cid:132) Always-present, pro-active, highly responsive 
interfaces make people more efficient, better 
informed.    Examples: 
(cid:132) Better memory (environment/objects around us “remember”
and recall information)
(cid:132) More effective learning (just-in-time information is 
presented when user is most motivated to learn)
(cid:132) Traditional computer interface disappears (replaced 
by augmented bodies & augmented environments)

To Do’s Next Two Weeks

(cid:132) By tomorrow: return class form
(cid:132) By next week (Class 2):
(cid:132) Check out class website (url will be mailed)
(cid:132) Read required readings and prepare ½ page 
questions & comments
(cid:132) Decide which topic(s)/papers you want to 
research & present
(cid:132) By week after (Class 3):
(cid:132) Write scenarios paper (2 pages)
