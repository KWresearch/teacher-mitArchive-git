What its about 


•	 Paper exists 
Its useful and persistent

•	
•	 Xerox is concerned with doc 
management 
•	 Scanning is problematic (more so in 
‘93) 

Paper UI 

• 

• 
• 
• 

Put digital markers (”glyphs”) on paper 
that are resistant to low-resolution and 
noisy digitization 
Put form boxes on paper 
Fax them to application server 
Do OCR and send info to database 

Results


•	 People found it more intuitive to use

•	 Currently Onoto pens would be better 
suited to avoid OCR and faxing 
process 
•	 Better yet use e-paper or projected AR

What its about 


•	 Static setup with projected structures 
on desk 
•	 Cameras capture physical objects and 
hands 
•	
Limited recognition of gestures

•	 Untethered interface 

Object Method 

• 

• 

Projection of IR shadows get 
recognized via cameras below 
Switching between 7 cameras in ring 
provides enough complimentary angles 

Benefits


•	

•	 Very inexpensive comparatively (versus 
stereo cameras, laser range finders, 
structured lighting, etc) 
Little calibration. Need to know 
approximate position of light sources and 
adjust side camera to see whole surface 
•  Does not use any moving parts, 7 light 

sources provide enough information 


Gesture recognition 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Types 
Symbolic 
Iconic (represent an object and 
attribute or motion.. i.e. tilt like this) 
Metaphoric (iconic + metaphor) 
Beat (movement up and down) 
Deictic (pointing)

Gesture recognition 

• 

• 

• 
• 

• 

Needs orientation of finger and hand via 
recovery of 3D info 
Extending arm creates shadow, edge tells you 
“shoulder” = source, farthest point = fingertip 
Cast shadow + light source position = plane 
Side view camera detects arm & fingertip, 
extrapolates two lines in 3D 
Intersection with the shadow = two 3D points, 
arm + fingertip 

Results


•	 Achieved 12-18 FPS for objects + 
gesture 
Latency is 0.25 - 0.33 seconds 
•	
•	 Apparently works decently well 
•	 Users with feedback adjust for lag

Selected Issues


•	 Main problem: depth ambiguity

•	 Augmented information must be 
differentiated from linking to visible and 
occluded objects 
•	 Occlusion is a major problem to solve 

•	 Motion parallax violation is bad 

Selected Issues


•	 Structure from motion might help with 
reducing visual complexity 
•	 Reduce motion as much as possible


Experiment Results 

• 

• 

Occlusion is the dominate visual cue 
for depth perception (over motion 
parallax) 
People cannot suspend their internal 
knowledge of objects and occlusion 
given other knowledge such as motion 
parallax

Spatial arrangements... 

• 
• 
• 

... that simplify choice 
... that simplify perception 
... that simplify internal computation 

Reducing complexity 

• 

• 
• 
• 

• 
• 

Reduce fan-out of actions represented as available 
at decision points 
Eliminate certain decision points 
Expose unnoticed constraints 
Improve search knowledge through chunking, 
caching, etc... 
Speed up creation of problem space representation 
Speed up low level computation of search and 
heuristic evaluation 

Reducing perceived actions 

• 

• 

Hiding affordances --
constraining   what 
is seen to be feasible 
Highlighting affordances --
cueing  
attention to what is feasible 

Example 

• 

Grocery baggers 
Need to categorize items on size, 
weight, fragility 
Use spatial buffers to aid in planning 
when items are not immediately 
available 
Nearby items are more likely to be 
used than distant

Offloading Example 

• Tetr
is 
Mental rotation takes 1000-1800ms 
• 
Physical rotation takes 200ms 
• 
Shifting the computation task to 
• 
spatial matching solves the problem 
faster 

Application 

• 

• 
• 
• 

• 

Personalized projections of epistemic 
structures 
Context-sensitive ordering structures 
Coordinating structures 
Scaffolds help with task such as checklist, 
helpers (noted by theory of learning) 
Intelligent use of space can save 
computation
