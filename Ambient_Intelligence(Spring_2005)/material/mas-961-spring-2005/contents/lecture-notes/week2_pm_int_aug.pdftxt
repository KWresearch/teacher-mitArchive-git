Artificial Intelligence (AI)

goal: build intelligent machines
justification:
– understand intelligence
– practical applications

CYC project (Lenat, MCC)

(cid:132) 10-15 person team
(cid:132) over course of last 18 years
(cid:132) entered all “common sense 
knowledge” a typical 10-year old 
would have in computer

Intelligence Augmentation (IA)

human 
+ machine 
= “super intelligence”

Technological inventions that 
overcome physical/perceptual 
limitations
(cid:132) glasses
(cid:132) hearing aids
(cid:132) cars
(cid:132) bicycles
(cid:132) voice synthesizers
(cid:132) ...

Why do we need technology 
to overcome cognitive 
limitations?
– lousy memory (short term as well as 
long term)
– only good at dealing with one thing at a 
time
– probabilities, logic non-intuitive
– slow to process large amounts of 
information
– bad at self-knowledge, introspection
– ...

Modern Man’s Environment
Vs
Cave Man’s Environment

Has the natural evolution of our 
brains not kept up with the rapid 
changes in our environment???

Mismatch complexity of our 
lives & our cognitive abilities

– too many things to keep track of
– information overload
– learn & remember more
– ...

Some old examples of 
intelligence augmentation

(cid:132) notes
(cid:132) reminders
(cid:132) watches
(cid:132) alarm clocks
(cid:132) ...

Some newer examples of 
intelligence augmentation
(cid:132) memory augmentation
(cid:132) “extra eyes, ears”
(cid:132) automation behavior patterns
(cid:132) information filtering
(cid:132) problem solving
(cid:132) matchmaking
(cid:132) transactions
(cid:132) introspection

Memory augmentation

(cid:132) help remember people, places, 
names, actions, ...
(cid:132) provide "just-in-time" 
information 

Remembrance agent (Emacs
version, Rhodes ‘99)

RA (Web version, Rhodes ‘99)

Discussion on 
Remembrance Agent

(cid:132) What are your thoughts on the 
paper? 
(cid:132) Would you want to “wear” a RA if 
it was more “fashionable”?

Extra eyes, ears, ... (Hive, 
Minar ’98)

(cid:132) monitors for changing bits as 
well as atoms:
– unusual ∆ price stocks
– has certain site changed?
– need more milk? 
– is there fresh coffee?
– ...

Automation behavior patterns 
(Kozierok, 90)

Benefiting from the problem 
solving done by others

(cid:132) few problems are original
(cid:132) why not benefit from problem 
solving done by others
– buying a car example:
- select a car
- select dealer
- find out about “fair” price
- negotiate price

Finding relevant products, 
services (Shardanand, Metral, 
93)

MIT Media Laboratory

Footprints: Finding popular 
paths on a website (Wexelblat, 99)

Matchmaking: Yenta (Foner, 99)

Transactions: Kasbah 
(Chavez, 97)

Kasbah example selling agent
(cid:132) Sell: Macintosh IIci
– Deadline: March  10th,1997
– Start  price: $900.00
– Min. price: $700.00
– Strategy: tough bargainer
– Location: local
– Level of Autonomy: check before 
transaction
– Reporting Method: event driven

Impulse: Agents that assist & 
automate transactions (Youll, 
Morris, 01)

Segue: Agents that help 
with self knowledge (Shearin, 01)

user’s habits over

People are good at:

(cid:132) judgement
(cid:132) understanding
(cid:132) reasoning, problem solving
(cid:132) creativity

Computers are good at:

(cid:132) remembering lots of facts
(cid:132) searching & processing huge 
amounts of information
(cid:132) being in many places at once
(cid:132) multi-tasking
(cid:132) being precise and organized
(cid:132) objectivity

Software Agents

An “agent” acts on your behalf

Software that is: 
(cid:132) personalized
(cid:132) proactive, more autonomous
(cid:132) long-lived, continuously running

How are agents programmed? 

(cid:132) user-instructed
(cid:132) knowledge-engineered
(cid:132) learned

Which approach is best?

Combination of 3 approaches:
(cid:132) give agent access to background 
knowledge which is available & 
general
(cid:132) allow user to program the agent, 
especially when the agent is new or 
drastic changes occur in user’s 
behavior
(cid:132) agent learns to adapt & suggest 
changes

Design challenges for IA

(cid:132) trust
(cid:132) responsibility
(cid:132) privacy
(cid:132) UI issues
(cid:132) avoid making people “dumber”

Trust

user needs to be able to trust the 
agents and other people s/he 
delegates to/interacts with

(cid:132) awareness of functionality
(cid:132) understanding limitations
(cid:132) predictability of outcome
(cid:132) Explanations available
(cid:132) ...

Responsibility

(cid:132) responsibilities for actions 
should be clear
(cid:132) user should feel in, be in control

Privacy

(cid:132) Self ownership of data
(cid:132) no subpoenas
(cid:132) user determines what is made 
available and to whom
(cid:132) anonymity an option
(cid:132) ...

UI Issues
(cid:132) Tricky balance between proactive 
help & agent being annoying
– Use “ambient” & minimal interface 
for agent suggestions
– Allow user to decide when to pay 
attention to agent suggestions
– Integrate suggestions in interface 
with minimal intrusion

Avoid making people dumber

“every extension is an amputation” 
Marshall McLuhan

Pick the right type of extension for the 
task at hand:
(cid:132) automating (eg milk)
(cid:132) assisting (eg memory)
(cid:132) teaching (eg probabilities)

Discussion

(cid:132) What are the limits of direct 
manipulation?
(cid:132) What tasks do you want help 
with?
(cid:132) What level of help? Automation? 
Assistance, teaching/tutoring?

Conclusions

(cid:132) Computers can do more to help 
us cope with our busy lives
(cid:132) Are we solving one problem and 
creating another?

How does this relate to 
Ambient Intelligence?

Ambient Intelligence = 
Intelligent interfaces
+ 
Ubiquitous computing
