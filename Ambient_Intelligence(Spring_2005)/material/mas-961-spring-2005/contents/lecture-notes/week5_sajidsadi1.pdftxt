Introduction

(cid:131) Mark Wieser outlined the basic tenets of ubicomp
in 1991
(cid:131) The physical devices proliferated
(cid:131) The software and infrastructure did not
(cid:131) Weiser’s vision: Context aware, context capturing 
devices with natural, robust HCIs

Ubicomp: Inherently Scalable

(cid:131) Physical scale: Not just the desktop
(cid:131) Actually, not even the palmtop
(cid:131) Human scale: Acceptable any and everywhere, 
and at critical mass
(cid:131) Temporal scale: Works 24/7, 365 days a year
(cid:131) Invites informal and unstructured use
(cid:131) Can deal with tasks that neither begin nor end
(cid:131) Poster Child: ParcTAB

Natural Interfaces

(cid:131) Definition: Interfaces that capitalize on expressive 
ability of humans
(cid:131) Speech
(cid:131) Gesture
(cid:131) Writing
(cid:131) Graspable/Tangible
(cid:131) Multimodality is also part of it

What We Are Missing…

(cid:131) Primary natural data types: a secondary class 
right now
(cid:131) Example: Convert writing to text
(cid:131) Error correction of natural data
(cid:131) Error reduction
(cid:131) Error discovery: understanding the task
(cid:131) Reusable infrastructure for the above
(cid:131) Spend less time reinventing the wheel

Context Aware:
Scratching the Surface

(cid:131) Currently used context:
(cid:131) Location: GPS, cell-based, etc
(cid:131) Personal info: generally identity + profile
(cid:131) Object recognition: bar codes, visual 
recognition
(cid:131) But what is the meaning of context?

What is Context?

(cid:131) Who: not just who the user is, but whom the 
interaction is with
(cid:131) What: knowing something about the user’s actions 
(difficult)
(cid:131) Where/When: well explored, but difficult indoors
(cid:131) Why: divining intent (affective and substantive)

More Context Considerations

(cid:131) Context representation
(cid:131) Context fusion: sensor fusion + context 
negotiation
(cid:131) Augmented reality: context + natural interaction
(cid:131) Augmented vision/audio can be a pathway for 
natural interaction

Reality Capture

(cid:131) Basic theme: continuous event capture (cid:198)
playback on demand
(cid:131) Extension: Mine extra information from the 
capture to annotate or enhance playback
(cid:131) Areas to explore: interactive playback, smart 
annotation, pervasive capture
(cid:131) Some hardware issues, but difficulty resides in 
deriving information

Everyday Computing

(cid:131) Change in the way humans interact with 
computers
(cid:131) From tool to presence
(cid:131) Support for all activities, without bounds

Aspects of Everyday Computing

(cid:131) Lack beginning and end
(cid:131) Natural consequence human interaction: works 
via action loops repeated across instances
(cid:131) Reverse of classical HCI: does not aim for 
closure
(cid:131) Interruptions
(cid:131) Many activities are intertwined, sometimes in 
the background
(cid:131) Support needed for these “context switches”

Aspect of EC (continued, 2)

(cid:131) Multiplexed activities
(cid:131) Awareness of background activity
(cid:131) Assistance for switching between activities 
smoothly and with relevance
(cid:131) Modulate intrusiveness by background state
(cid:131) Time discriminate
(cid:131) Pay attention to temporal ordering of actions
(cid:131) Account for memory degradation over time

Aspect of EC (continued, 3)

(cid:131) Addressing associative nature of memory
(cid:131) People remember and work associatively
(cid:131) Information in associative form is more 
intuitive and relevant in many cases, because 
we form associative categories mentally
(cid:131) Also inherently supports multiple views

Research Directions

(cid:131) Continuously present interfaces
(cid:131) Peripheral displays with level of detail
(cid:131) Smooth transitions between digital and real
(cid:131) Peripheral/opportunistic HCI methods

Challenge: Evaluation

(cid:131) Ubicomp projects tend not to pass prototype state
(cid:131) Research ends up technocentric

Thoughts on Evaluation

(cid:131) Find a human need
(cid:131) Have a compelling scenario for usage – do not 
design the solution in search of a problem
(cid:131) Use user studies to inform the grand vision
(cid:131) Working with real users shows the actual limits 
of technology
(cid:131) Realistic scenarios can often inform of 
particular stumbling points and trade-offs

Thoughts on Evaluation (2)

(cid:131) Test the system in a real context
(cid:131) Need to observe user within routine
(cid:131) Actual deployment shows assumptions and 
mistakes of design
(cid:131) Provides feedback on the level of observation 
needed even at small scales
(cid:131) Task-centric evaluations are inappropriate
(cid:131) Standard usability tests (and settings) are not 
very useful as well

Challenge: Social Issues

(cid:131) Control: who watches the watchers, what is being 
recorded, who has access and when
(cid:131) Security of information
(cid:131) Privacy concerns
(cid:131) Transparency of computer actions (or lack 
thereof)
(cid:131) Legal implications of enabling technology
(cid:131) [Business implications]

Conclusions

(cid:131) Weiser: Compelling applications will drive 
technology [too limiting]
(cid:131) No single application usually drives critical mass 
acceptance
(cid:131) General purpose, fluid utility of ubicomp should 
drive the technology and research
