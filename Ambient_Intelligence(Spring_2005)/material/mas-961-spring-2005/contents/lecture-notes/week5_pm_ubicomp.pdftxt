Class 5 (cont)

(cid:132) PROJECT PROPOSAL DUE!!!
- 2-3 pages:
– What is it & why is it interesting?
– Usage Scenario
– How will it be implemented?
– What parts will you complete for this class
– What do you hope to learn?

Mark Weiser’s vision (1988-on)

(cid:132) “Disappearing technologies” are 
most profound ones
– Eg writing: ubiquitous, does not 
require active attention, ready for 
use at a glance
(cid:132) The best tools are invisible tools 
(focus is on the task not the tool)

Information Technology is not 
(yet) a “disappearing 
technology”
– Computer remains in world of its 
own, not integrated in environment
– Approachable only through 
complex jargon that has nothing to 
do with tasks being used for 
– Not just UI issue, also a hardware 
issue

What does it mean for a 
technology to “disappear”?

(cid:132) Not consequence of technology
(cid:132) But of human psychology
– When people learn something 
sufficiently well, they cease to be aware 
of it, they can focus beyond the 
technology on new (true) goals
– Called “compiling” by H. Simon, or 
“periphery” by J. Seely Brown

Weiser’s vision: Ubiquitous 
Computing
(cid:132) Computers everywhere, 
disappearing/integrated in 
environment/objects around us
(cid:132) Computer no longer isolates us from 
tasks/environment, no longer focus of 
attention
(cid:132) Social Impact
Similar to writing: found everywhere 
from clothes labels to billboards
(cid:132) Similar to electricity
which surges invisibly through the 
walls of every home, office, car

Ubiquitous computing 
constitutes a reversal of some 
other trends
(cid:132) Ubiquitous computing does not 
mean:
– Computers that can be carried 
everywhere
– Multi-media computers (using more 
sensors/output modalities)
– Virtual reality (create a world inside the 
computer, rather than enhance the real 
world with computer data)
– Computer as personal assistant, “agent”

Ubiquitous Computing 

(cid:132) Hundreds of computersin every 
room
(cid:132) Wirelessly networked
(cid:132) With their own display
(cid:132) Computation happens in the 
background

Xerox Parc Experiments in 
Ubiquitous Computing

(cid:132) Focus on devices that transmit & 
display information
(cid:132) Two important issues: 
– Location (UC’s must know where they 
are so they can adapt their behavior)
– Scale (different scales needed to suit 
different tasks): tabs (post-it), pads 
(paper) and boards
- Typical room: hundred tabs, 10-20 pads, 1-2 
boards, all inter-connected

Some TAB examples

(cid:132) Active badges for people or objects
– Automated call forwarding based on 
location of people
– Automatic login to computers
– Automatic diaries (eg meeting)
(cid:132) Tabs as extensions of computer 
screens (to make programs/file 
portable to other machine)

Some PAD examples

(cid:132) Differ from conventional portable 
computers: intended as “scrap 
computers”; no individualized 
identity or importance; spread many 
around the desk, in drawers, etc
(cid:132) Increase desk size of current 
computers

Some BOARD examples

(cid:132) Number of purposes: video screen, 
bulletin board, white board, flip chart, 
electronic bookcase (download 
things onto a PAD)
(cid:132) “Liveboard”: works with wireless, 
electronic “chalk”, is interactive
– permits collaboration at a distance
– Also used as personalized bulletin 
boards (user wears active badge)

Cons of Ubiquitous 
Computing

(cid:132) The current computer is: 
– Generic
– Adaptive
– Programmable (extensible)
(cid:132) Space 
(cid:132) Cost
(cid:132) …

State of Ubiquitous 
Computing

(cid:132) Conferences: 
– Ubicomp
– Mobiquitous
– Pervasive Computing
– …
(cid:132) Journals: 
– IEEE Pervasive Computing journal
– Springer Personal & Ubiquitous 
computing journal

Calm Technology, Weiser & 
Seely Brown

(cid:132) Ubicomp community went off track
(cid:132) Ubicomp technology should be 
“calm”: stay out of the way while 
informing
(cid:132) Contrast with the way technology is 
designed now:in your face, highly 
interactive,using multiple modalities, 
etc

Calm Technology, Weiser & 
Seely Brown
(cid:132) Calm technology enhances our 
peripheral reach (bringing more 
details into the periphery)
(cid:132) Periphery: What we are attuned to 
without attending to explicitly, 
Informing without overburdening, 
(cid:132) Calm technologies move easily 
between center of attention & 
periphery (eg text)

CalmTechnology

(cid:132) Other word  for Ambient Interfaces 
(Ishii)
(cid:132) Example: 
– dangling string representing network 
traffic (Jeremijenko)
– Inner office windows
– Internet muticast (window of awareness)
