Augmented Object  

I was trying to think about objects that I always have on or around me and what hasn’t 
been augmented. Glasses? AR. Shoes? Work has been done in Joe P.’s group. Wallet? 
RFID debit from cell phone. Wall? Every ubi-comp project. But how about earrings? 
Earrings are interesting, especially because there isn’t any (practical) limit to their size 
and design. Typical gender roles create restrictions for men in America, but I think the 
tech factor can definitely change that. What’s nice about earrings is that they’re right next 
to the ear… close enough that perhaps by using the right material, attachment, and 
method of vibrating we could have it transmit sound to our ear. I don’t know if its 
possible, but ideally it would be subtle enough that people around us couldn’t hear it but 
since it’s on our ear we could hear it.  

Add a microphone, wireless connection (Bluetooth, wifi, radio, etc, or even IR), and an 
IC and many things could happen. It could be an audio loop (recording buffer) that allows 
us to listen to people’s names in case we forget (perhaps we have a controller built into 
our clothing, part of a ring/accessible jewelry, belt, or in our hand so accessing the data is 
discrete). Or it could be part of a larger system taking in voice input. There has been 
work (including David Merrill) using eye glasses as an IR guide/sensor, but why not put 
it on an earring? This would be particularly useful for people like me who has an earring 
but does not wear glasses. With the proper wireless device, it could also be used as a geo (cid:173)
location beacon. Voice input might tell it when to allow presence-broadcasting or not. Or 
turning a ring so that it has some particular orientation could switch between the two 
(ring is obviously networked with earring). Hook it up to my cell phone, and it could 
announce (ideally to only me) the incoming caller. With the microphone it becomes a 
hands-free headset. 

It also could be used to listen to the environment passively and detect when I am talking 
to someone. Having a vibration sensor might detect high-frequency vibrations (my 
speech) and understand turn taking. This might be a cue for a context-aware application 
to know when not to disturb me, or when to take notes. Or by knowing when I’m asleep, 
it could alert me when it hears something suspicious (such as glass breaking) occurs or be 
used as an alarm clock. Add an accelerometer and it knows when I get out of bed or when 
I fall back asleep. Or sit or walk without requiring geo-location. Or detect a lot of 
movement (with the proper context such as volume level, geo-location, and time) and it 
might know when I’m dancing. When I’m dancing a lot, it could potentially record the 
music for me for later listening.
