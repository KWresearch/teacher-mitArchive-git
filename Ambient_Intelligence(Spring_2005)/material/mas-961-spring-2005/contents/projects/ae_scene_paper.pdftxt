Scenarios Paper 

The alarm set itself last night; it knew when his first class is and how late he was up last 
night, and also knows how long (on average) it takes for him to wake. When it goes off, 
the student rolls out of bed. Sensors that detect his movement set the entire apartment in 
motion. 

His personal wearable (with the computing power of a laptop) was set aside on the night-
table the night before; Now that he is awake, it’s going through his usual morning routine, 
checking his email and pulling the content of the web-pages that he frequents every 
morning. Since he isn’t wearing the display, it displays on the monitor on his desk. Its 
discrete light blinks to tell him that he’s got an important message waiting to be seen in 
his queue. 

A digital display on the wall above his bed also shows him a colorful, graphical version 
of his daily schedule. It also notes important things for today and the next few days (his 
problem set is due tomorrow afternoon, and his best friend’s birthday is two days from 
now). He sees that another friend had requested a dinner date with him that night; since 
he’d trained his scheduler to put her as high priority, it has already agreed to the date on 
his behalf and suggested a restaurant that they have both rated highly. He thinks cooking 
might be a more entertaining option, and sets an active search agent loose to find good 
recipes for beginners. He then goes to shower, the bathroom being the only truly private 
place in the house - he has not augmented the room with displays or sensors, and signals 
are jammed within. 

There’s a status report in the kitchen, keeping inventories of what is low (he’s out of 
coffee, makes a note on his wearable to remind him to buy more if he happens to walk 
within a block of one of the shops). As he eats breakfast, he scans the list of recipes that 
his agent has gathered. After he selects one, the agent compares the ingredients to the 
rough inventory of what he has around his kitchen, and then appends a list of needed 
ingredients to his coffee-reminder. His assisting agent also suggests a free time during his 
day when he might acquire these ingredients; if he wanted to, he could tell it to send an 
order to the store, and then go pick the assembled groceries up later that day.  

Back in his room, when he approaches his closet, a weather report shows up on his digital 
display. He also gets a warning that the bus is only a few stops away. He quickly dresses 
and takes off. 

At school, as he sits in class, he takes notes on a tablet attached to his wearable. The 
professor has written a comprehensive set of notes beforehand and projected them on a 
virtual whiteboard, phasing them in bit by bit as she speaks. If she hits upon an 
interesting topic that he wants to research later, he feeds it to his active search agent; it 
will queue up a batch of the most relevant hits. When he has questions, he can note them 
for later, or raise a question up on the board, particularly if something has been written 
wrong or is unclear. A light at the lectern will inform the professor and give her the

opportunity to stop at the next pause in her lecture to answer their questions, rather than 
interrupt her train of thought. 

Later, during a meeting with his advisor, he is able to call up the notes he took during 
their previous meetings and address those topics before they move on. When his advisor 
mentions similar work being done by some of his peers, his agent notes their names and 
goes to the website documenting their work; if he wishes, his agent will send a form 
email to them introducing himself and asking if they’d like to get together and talk shop 
sometime. It also cues into their wearables; they have apparently expressed an interest in 
meeting researchers with their shared interests. Now, if they coincidentally end up in the 
same lab together on-campus, there will be a subtle message on their displays informing 
them that the other is near.  

After he has left his advisor’s office, he realizes he still has a question he forgot to ask. 
He asks his assistant agent to query hers at the next best possible time (as she is in a 
meeting at the current time); this works more quickly and informally than an email. 

His cell starts to vibrate as he walks through the halls. This is not to indicate a call, but 
rather, that one of his friends is in close proximity. Their cells are all on an experimental 
campus-network that allows students to categorize their friends and then inform them 
when they are in close proximity (i.e. the same building). He can gauge by the light of the 
display that it is one of his best friends, and if he flips the clamshell open, he will be able 
to see their name(s). A shift to another color warns him that someone he is avoiding – 
namely, one of his partners on a project – is also in the building. He decides to make a 
quick exit and head to the grocery store, where his purchases are already assembled and 
waiting. 

Later that night, as he is cooking in preparation for his date, he’s cued the entertainment 
system in with a more romantic setting. His television display (when not displaying an 
actual television feed) usually displays a frenetic art-piece that responds to his emails and 
musical choice. He changes it to something more soothing – the growth of a tree and a 
virtual garden – that will respond to the sounds in the apartment. Recognizing the change 
in context, his assistant agent lowers the volume of his entertainment system and changes 
the playlist to something more appropriate than loud rock. 

When his friend shows up, his cell knows she’s in range long before she’s at the door. 
Once they get to eating and talking, he makes a comment on the subtly-lighted-jewelry 
she’s wearing. It’s yet another attempt at social networking technology: a system of 
bluetooth (feeding into a wearable) and hybrid RFID tags that broadcast a person’s 
interests and have been programmed with their network of friends. People with similar 
interests or mutual friends will be informed of one and other in close proximity. She 
recounts the strange encounters she’s had in the last week as a result. 

When she finally leaves, he throws all of the dishes in the sink and switches back over to 
his usual entertainment-preferences. He quickly skims through all of the websites and 
data his agent has queued up on his desktop, and then gets to working on his problem sets.

Though it will automatically set itself once it senses he has gone to bed (lights off, or 
minimal motion-sensing), he programs the alarm to set itself 10 minutes earlier than it 
normally would so he can do the dishes in the morning. Eventually, like any college 
student, he falls asleep at his desk. While he sleeps, his wearable backs itself up onto his 
desktop. 

And thus ends this quite farfetched scenario of almost-debilitating (not to mention quite-
distracting) ambient intelligence.  

(One thing I didn't touch on here, but that I would be interested in looking at - what kinds 
of information and personal "touches" would a person leave behind if they died? Having 
many agents around that have become so familiar with a person's personal habits...a 
computer wouldn't know that they were gone, and would just keep performing the 
routines of daily life. How would one "kill" all of these activities at once? Or should they 
- would this help or hurt the grieving process of their families?)
