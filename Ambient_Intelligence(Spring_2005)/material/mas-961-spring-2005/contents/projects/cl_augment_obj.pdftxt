augmented shoes :: twistings :: 6 apr 2005 

inspired by this last weekend’s less-than-ideal encounter with the latest spring fashions, 
i’ve been thinking of ways to embellish and revolutionize the often revered but easily 
overlooked wearable accessory: the shoe. 

in relation to how many choices there are in clothing sizes and silhouettes, most shoes are 
limited in terms of last (the shape of the foot inside the shoe) and volumetric proportion 
(foot thickness, or ratio of ball to heel width). save for expensive options like specialty 
shoes or marginal sizes, human feet are often squeezed into ill-fitting options. since there 
exists such variable sizing standards among companies and also ‘give’ of certain 
materials and fabrics, shoe shopping is tedious, imperfect, and usually requires in-person 
try-out (“if the shoe fits, wear it”). one solution to this might be having a foot scanner that 
models a person’s physical appendage (this already sort of exists for jeans at selfridges 
from bodymetrics) and then recommends certain sizes and shapes for the wearer; this 
way someone could even feel comfortable ordering shoes from a catalog or online. 
another solution might be to insert sensors into the interior of an existing shoe. either the 
sensors can be used during the shoe-fitting process (if you try on a shoe, sensors will 
indicate exactly where tightness or looseness occurs, and recommend a better size), or 
used within existing footwear to collect data over time (like flatfootedness or necessary 
heel cushioning) in regards to how a person can obtain shoes that are optimally 
comfortable and durable. 

other thoughts on shoes: it might be helpful if shoes could improve the surface on which 
they stepped. perhaps there could be a sensor on a shoe that would recognize if it were 
indoors, and slide an indoors sheath or repellent material along the bottom; the outdoors 
and indoors sole contamination would be minimized. also, perhaps a cleaning sole could 
be attached or dispensed so that someone could help keep their floors clean by merely 
walking about their home over time. toss your swiffer! other ideas would be shoes with 
built-in pedometers and pressure sensors to record and distinguish low-impact and high-
impact activities, an RFID bump-toe interface (input through tapping or kicking an 
object), and customization via multiple styles of conductive lacings through the eyelets.
