Introduction 

This project focuses on a remote awareness system using a wind chime as the output device. 
In  keeping  with  the  Ambient  Intelligence  vision  of  augmenting  real  life  objects  with  digital 
behavior,  I  wanted  to  augment  an  object  that  is  naturally  designed  to  work  in  the 
background  to  carry  a  higher  level  of  information.  Often  times,  we  find  ourselves 
augmenting  completely  artificially  purposed  objects  for  use  in  the  ambient  channel. 
However,  I  believe  that  the  limited  peripheral  bandwidth  should  benefit  from  natural 
mappings to the same extent as other input channels do. Another goal for the project was to 
keep the natural affordance of the wind chime, whether visual, aural, or functional, as similar 
to  the  unmodified  version  as  possible.  While  it  is  possible  to  add  lights  or  hammers  to  a 
chime,  those  modifications  alter  the  basic  semantics  of  the  wind  chime  in  a  why  that 
damages  the  natural  mappings  that  we  associate  with  the  device,  which  we  expect  to  be 
motivated  in  a  pseudo-random  fashion  by  the  breeze. However,  at  the  same  time,  I wanted 
to  maximize  the  level  of  digital  control  over  the  object,  in  order  to  carry  information  as 
efficiently  as  possible.  As  such,  I  chose  instead  of  tapping  the  chimes  with  hammers,  to 
instead  motivate  the  central  striker  of  the  chime  itself  in  a  way  that  allows  the  device  to 
remain fully functional in its original way.  
 
For an  information mapping,  the chime “displays” movement  in a number of channels. The 
motion  is  captured by  a  camera  and mapped  to  a  channel. Each  channel has  its own  chime. 
Of  course,  any  number  mappings  are  in  fact  possible  by  using  sequences  of  taps.  The 
cameras  can  be  remotely  located,  and  send  information  to  the  computer  controlling  the 
chime,  which  then  handles  the  mapping.  When  a  triggering  event  is  detected,  the  striker  is 
motivated to first hit the chime mapped to that channel  in a pattern. The striker then moves 
at random to a gradual stop. While this is not a very direct mapping, it does allow for level of 
detail.  When  passers-by  hear  the  chime,  even  if  they  know  the  purpose  of  the  chime,  they 
cannot  discern  the  channel.  However,  over  time,  it  becomes  easier  for  them  to  map  the 
chimes  to  locations,  and  a  long  time user  can  use  the  chimes  to  directly  know when  an  area 
is “active.” Additionally, a number of other pattern mappings are possible. Each channel can 
also  encode  their  identity  (or  other  information)  in  the  pattern  of  initial  hits.  For  example, 
the number of  taps may be mapped  to  the amount of motion detected, or  the certainty with 
which  the  camera  system  believes  it  has  seen  the  motion.  It  can  also  encode  discrete 
information.  One  example  would  be  to  use  a  different  initial  pattern  for  a  when  a  single 
person is detected, vs. when a mass of people is detected. 
 
Design 

Note:  Please  refer  to  the  attached  diagram  for  arrangements  of  parts.  Since  I wanted  to  use 
the  striker  normally  and  retain  maximal  control,  a  motor-based  driver  was  out  of  the 
question.  Therefore,  I  chose  to  use  electromagnets  to  drive  the  striker  arm.  In  early 
experimentation, I found that  if the striker arm were flexible, the magnets simple moved the 
entire  attraction  ring  (made  of  ferrous  magnetically  attractable  rings  attached  in  a  stack  to 
allow  the  magnets  an  area  to  act  upon)  and  striker  sideways  and  up,  and  then  released  it 
causing  a  large  amount  of  vertical  jitter,  which  in  turn  made  the  motion  highly  chaotic.  I 
therefore replaced  the part above  the striker with a  lightweight metallic rod  that would resist 
the  bending  forces  placed  on  it  and  keep  the  striker  arm  at  the  nominal  vertical  distance. 
However,  since  the  striker  arm must  be  able  to  move  freely,  I  also  designed  a  nylon  omni-

directional  joint  at  the  top  that  prevented  sideways  motion,  but  allows  full  angular  motion, 
thus allowing natural movement of the striker. 
 
In doing the preliminary experiments, I also found that the striker itself had insufficient mass 
to move like a pendulum, even with the added mass of the now metallic striker arm. I found 
that  the  momentum  retention  mass  at  the  end  of  the  striker  arm,  far  from  being  purely 
decorative, was in fact crucial to the pendulum-like motion of the striker. However, I did not 
want  to  replace  the entire arm with metal because  the added mass would make  it difficult  to 
move  the  striker,  since  additional  metal  will  add  mass  to  the  long  side  of  a  lever  arm  from 
the  point  of  view  of  the  magnets.  This  led  to  some  experimentation  in  attaching  the  nylon 
line  from  the mass  to  the metal  rod.  The  end  result  was  an  arm  that  could  be magnetically 
motivated  to  periodic  pendulum-like  motion,  but  at  the  same  time  was  light  and  retained 
original angular motion flexibility. 
 
The circuit design also posed a number of challenges, since the electromagnets require much 
higher  voltages  than  the  microcontroller,  and  at  the  moment  of  disconnection,  produce  a 
high  voltage,  high  current  inductive  pulse,  that  despite  protective  circuitry  can  cause  much 
damage. After destroying several chips  in the search of a remedy, I was finally able to design 
a  circuit  that  could  handle  the  current  requirements  of  the  magnets  (0.3  amps  at  20  volts) 
while  keeping  safe  the  microcontroller.  The  microcontroller  accepts  commands  from  the 
computer via  serial port, and can control up  to 8  independent channels of magnets.  It  is  the 
work of the computer to handle the timing of magnet activation and the pattern used, which 
makes  the  system  highly  extensible  and  customization,  while  retaining  simplicity  and 
robustness in the driver circuits. 
 
In  placing  the  magnets  themselves,  I  also  found  that  having  the  axis  of  the  magnet  well 
aligned  with  the  chime  center  greatly  improved  the  sound  quality  and  ensuing  random 
motion  of  the  chime.  Additionally,  the  magnets  must  be  properly  positioned  to  allow 
unrestricted  motion  (i.e.,  the  attractor  rings  should  not  hit  the  magnet),  while  at  the  same 
time  being  close  enough  to  allow  the  magnetic  field  to  initially  move  the  object.  Since  the 
magnetic field falls off as the square of the distance, it is important to have these adjustments 
correctly  done.  However,  it  also  offers  an  option  to  soften  the  sound  of  the  chime,  which 
allows it to act more easily via background channels. 
 
Lessons Learned 

In  designing  this  chime,  I  took  many  of  the  lessons  learned  by  Todd  Machover’s  group  in 
designing  the  Macy’s  Flower  Show  wind  chimes  and  addressed  many  of  what  I  consider 
flaws  in  that  design.  The  chimes  for  the  show  were  actuated  by  blowing  on  pinwheel,  and 
did  not  have  any  directional  control,  being  simply  actuated  by  an  offset  motor  that  swung 
the  striker  to  hit  the  chimes.  Such  a  mapping  greatly  limits  the  amount  of  information  the 
system  (in  fact,  only  one  bit  of  information  is  really  present).  Additionally,  the  actuation 
method  completely  removed  the  natural  auditory  affordance  of  the  chime  and  replaced  it 
with  a  very  ordered,  sequential  sound  that  only  sounded  like  the  sound  in  terms  of  audio 
output modality, not  in  the same semantic sense.  I consider  the semantic similarity provided 
by my design  to be  crucial  to  the use of  the devices as peripheral audio  interfaces,  since  it  is 
that  familiarity  and  expectation  of  ambient  action  that  makes  the  wind  chime  a  good 
candidate for augmentation in the first place. 

 
I  was  also  able  to  do  a  good  bit  of  analysis  and  self-education  in  controlling  solenoids  and 
mixed-signal,  mixed-voltage  circuitry.  Mixed  voltage  circuitry  presents  a  number  of 
challenges  in  designing  and  protecting  circuitry,  and  this  in  itself  forms  an  interesting  venue 
of  analysis.  And  finally,  needless  to  say  I  found  out  a  good  deal  about  how  a  chime  really 
works  in the mechanical sense, and how the different tolerances, gaps, masses, and materials 
interact  to  form  the  sort  of  sound  and  motion  we  expect  from  a  wind  chime.  This 
understanding, combined with some investigation into how people really perceive the chime, 
allowed me to get a much better idea of how the interaction should designed and controlled. 
 
Conclusion and Future Plans 

In summary, I was able to create a network-controlled, motion sensitive wind chime that can 
be  used  for  remote  awareness  systems  using  the  peripheral  channel.  The  design  of  the 
project  focused  on  maintaining  affordance,  both  physical  and  structural,  and  thus  presents 
some interesting channels in term of designing the augmentation and implementing it. 
 
In  the  near  future,  I  would  like  to  clean  up  the  API  to  the  camera,  and  allow  easy  use  of 
network-attached  cameras  and  online  video  clips/web  cam  shots.  I would  also  like  to  clean 
up  the  circuit  design  and  set  up  magnets  for  all  the  remaining  chimes.  The  magnets  are 
currently attached with adhesive tape, and thus require design of a mounting system that can 
accommodate changes to  the distance  the magnet  is from the attraction rings. However, this 
must  be  delayed  until  a  suitable  magnet  to  control  the  motion  is  found,  since  the  ones 
currently in use are too large for the space available. Lastly, I have a number of possible uses 
for  the  generic  notification  device,  and  would  like  to  quickly  investigate  them  in  order  to 
understand the sorts of data that could benefit from an interface like this.
