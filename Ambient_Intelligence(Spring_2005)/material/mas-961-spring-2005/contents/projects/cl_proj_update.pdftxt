project update :: a complete turnaround 

scope, well-revised 

well, i've decided to go the capricious route and completely change my project design. 
'submergence' had its fans, yes, but i've chosen to submit that to the ars electronica next 
idea application and allow it to simmer within the throes of conceptual art. the heart-rate 
thing seemed to be too close for comfort and, incidentally, i haven't had much luck 
procuring affordable heart rate monitors to tinker with.  

the next next idea: quilted pixels. i'm fascinated with custom fabricated textiles + clothing, 
and moving the invisible digital back into the physical realm. i've been playing with this 
idea of fabric that is not decorated externally (i.e. silkscreening, iron-on, stitching), but 
rather has its decoration potential installed internally, as an all-in-one package. the 
material itself could provide creative resource and decorative possibility to the wearer; 
the control shifts from the manufacturer and choice-limiter to the consumer as creator.  

scenario plays as such: one purchases a stash of 'blank' apparel or accessories, such as 
one would get white paper. an image could be acquired by the user, either by directly 
downloading an image to the garment (akin to choosing + ordering a specific ringtone for 
your phone), capturing an image through a camera (akin to recording a real-time sound as 
a ringtone), or creating your own image through a drawing pixel program (akin to 
creation via ringtone composer). after specifying the image + position + color (in an ideal 
scnario), the wearer inputs the data into the garment and the fabric then dyes itself 
through pixels that bleed the appropriate colors.  

a strong point of this design is that the image would be permanently stained onto the 
clothing. the fabric isn't merely a dynamic display; it's a conscious action to 'develop' 
such an image onto oneself, a decisive branding. the color permanence gives it weight + 
identity significance.  

hard stuff: by using quilted fabric, each pixel will hold some sort of dye that will release 
upon trigger. still trying to figure out the best way to do the color transfer. some ideas: (1) 
putting dye into capsules (stage-blood-esque, or very weak paintballs) and triggering via 
physical breakage (electronic pinches?) or a motored grind; (2) using a central reservoir 
which flows/leaks dye into corresponding pixels by controlling the valves; (3) using 
thermochromic ink, which changes color with heat. i would want an irreversible type of 
this dye. 

soft stuff: right now 

so far 

fabric: got gobs of white cotton quilted fabric. each pillowed pixel is about half-inch 
square. research: recipes for stage-blood, thoughts of using gelatine capsules, heating 
elements, thermochromic dye (colorchange.com, but the website makes your eyes bleed),

the ruug project (http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/adrianat/portfolio.html), how high of a 
resolution needed to convey image without being totally unwieldy (a 5x6 matrix?).  

planning ahead 

at the very least, would want my own hard-coded designs to appear. would like to make a 
simple GUI software that would be a pixel-paint program that would enable users to 
design + download their created designs.
