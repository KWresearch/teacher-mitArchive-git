Project Update 

Progress Report 

What’s been accomplished so far:  
The server has been set up and the page template has been designed (can be seen at 
coincidence.mit.edu). The MySQL? database has been set up, and I’ve been working on 
the code for the text-fields and handling storage in the database. Sadly, there’s nothing 
really cohesive enough to show off just yet (and I keep most of the content offline to keep 
anyone from stumbling around on the site and adding entries that I might accidentally 
miss while testing). 

Changes to the project: 
liMIT is no longer an instant messaging client. After some speculation, I realized that 
almost all of the users of this type of program would probably already be using AIM or a 
similar, popular messaging client - and it would be much simpler to allow them to 
provide their screen-names than to write a new client to handle their messages. Users will 
still be able to ping others and catch their attention, and if the other user responds 
positively, the first user will be able to retrieve their screen name with the java-client. 
Otherwise, the project design has remained pretty much the same. Oh, and the new name 
is “quelle coincidence!” Catchy, isn’t it? 

For the next month: 
While I would ultimately like to see this project to completion, time constraints have 
pushed that completion date to the summer. I’ve scaled back for now, and my new goal is 
to “finish” just the server-side aspects of this project by the end of this semester. Sadly, 
the server alone won’t look impressive, but it’s a good portion the system. I’ll probably 
also work out another interface-design or two for the user-pages, since my current design 
might not appeal to everyone. Finally, I would also (hopefully) get some conceptual 
sketches of what the actual client would look like, and maybe even get started coding the 
client-side.
