Augmenting Everyday Objects  

Today, it is possible to get a chair that has so many degrees of freedom that you would 
need to open up the manual just to find out how to make it recline. However, we haven’t 
really put good intelligence into adjusting a chair, especially one that multiple people sit 
in. A good example is a car sear. Many are 12-way adjustable, but few are adjusted well. 
The interaction between the different adjustments makes it difficult to know which way 
to adjust it. However, if the chair simply understood a few phrases and acted accordingly, 
it would be fairly simple to get things right, when combined with a few pressure sensors. 
For example, if the back feels too straight to a person my size, it is usually not because of 
the back angle, but the seat cushion angle and lumbar pressure. By looking at the sensors 
and noticing that those pressures are too high at the lumbar region and too low at the back 
of the seat, a system could use such an ambiguous command and still adjust the seat 
optimally. By incorporating the simple ideas of interdependence between the degrees of 
freedom and the fact that comfortable chairs distribute pressure evenly (as Sealy and a 
hundred bed companies are always pointing out), it is not difficult to create seating that 
fits the person in an intelligent way, not only for car seats, but for chairs in general.  

Another interesting thing to augment would be a key fob. Currently, they only carry 
physical keys. However, there is no reason that they should not carry digital ones as well. 
We have long wanted doors to just open when we approached them. To that end, there is 
an endless parade of RFID and card readers decorating our doors, but they merely change 
the key use gesture, not remove it. However, if the door knew when the handle was being 
touched and simply spoke to my key fob to get the digital key needed to open itself, that 
would enhance my interaction with the door without burdening my wallet with yet 
another plastic key. These sorts of challenge-reply key mechanisms are common on the 
internet, and are fairly secure. Since the door doesn’t challenge till the handle is touched 
(which also disambiguates desire to open the door), there is no possibility for remote 
hacking. One must actually stand and the door to pick the lock, just as one must do so 
today, thus affording the same security. However, the loss of the key fob is mitigated by 
the fact that they keys can be changed instantly without changes to the lock. While people 
might fear that the computers controlling the system may be hacked, it is generally 
difficult to hack embedded systems that do not connect to the world, as in fact a security 
system should avoid doing. Additionally, the system should embody a safeguard that 
allows opening in case of emergency or loss of power to retain the confidence that we 
have today that we would be able to get through a door regardless of the electricity, 
another integral part of the mental affordance of a lock. At the end of the day, it is not the 
system itself, but the trust one has in it, that determines its use, and that is probably the 
biggest hurdle to a device such as this augmented door/key fob combo. Beyond the pure 
electronic augmentation, there exist a number of other uses that are more agent-oriented. 
For example, the workshop in the basement could remind you when you are not 
authorized for a particular tool, of if you are still in the training period, when you are 
supposed to work under supervision of an experienced user. Likewise, the door could 
recognize that you are still in view of it, and not close if you are, or perhaps close once 
you are no longer looking at it. It could also be a way to validate who is outside the door 
and simply allow entry via voice command if the person touching the doorknob is

trustworthy. This would be a case of the door recognizing the person, but requiring 
confirmation due to courtesy and social issues.
