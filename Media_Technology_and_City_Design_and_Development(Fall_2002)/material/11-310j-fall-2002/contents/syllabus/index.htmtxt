***** Overview *****
This workshop explores the potential of media technology and the Internet to
enhance communication and transform city design and community development in
inner-city neighborhoods. The class introduces a variety of methods for
describing or representing a place and its residents, for simulating actions
and changes, for presenting visions of the future, and for engaging multiple
actors in the process of envisioning change and guiding action. Students will
engage one neighborhood, meet real people working on real projects, put theory
into practice, and reflect on insights gained in the process.
This year the course will examine what it means to be an urban designer/planner
and how to create a digital teaching tool (using digital storytelling) that
supports others in learning about the relationship between design and planning
professionals, on the one hand, and members of the communities they serve, on
the other. What is the nature of the knowledge that resides in a community and
how can designers and planners learn about, tap, and use that knowledge? What
is the relationship between community organizing and urban design and planning?
What are the relationships between you as a professional, the place(s) in which
you work, and the values and care you bring to that work?
We will explore these themes in the context of Camfield Estates in Lower
Roxbury, MA and its participation in the US Department of Housing and Urban
Development's (HUD) Demonstration Disposition Project. There have been many
stories written about Camfield Estates' participation in the Demonstration
Disposition project, for it has been widely regarded as a model of success.
There are two stories that have not yet been told, however: the story of the
residents who organized the community and the story of the architects and
planners who participated in the project. This course will use digital
storytelling to reconstruct and connect these two stories.
***** Course Format *****
The course meets once a week in workshop sessions at MIT. The three-hour class
is normally divided into three parts: reflection (discussion based on journal
writing from the previous week), presentation (discussion of material relevant
to themes of the class and/or discussion of student work), and lab (skill-
building activities).
Work-in-progress will be presented and discussed in class. Completed digital
stories will be screened and discussed with invited guests. Also planned are a
series of public screenings during the spring semester.
***** Course Requirements *****
Work for the semester will be evaluated in four ways: participation in class
discsussion (15% of final grade); a journal, to be turned in weekly via email
(15%); proposal for digital story on Camfield Estates (10%); digital story on
Camfield Estates (30%); personal digital story (30%). There will be no final
exam. Ongoing work and final projects will be posted online. It is very
important to submit assignments on time, including weekly journals, since class
discussion and labs are based on student work. There will be no extensions
without prior, written, consent of the instructors. Late submissions will
receive a reduction in grade.
Prior experience with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere is not a prerequisite
for this class. While labs do include an introduction to the skills needed for
the class, you are responsible for preparing for labs beforehand by working
through relevant sections of The Digital Storytelling Cookbook
(www.storycenter.org/cookbook.html) and getting as far as you can on your own.
After the first few classes, the labs will serve primarily as trouble-shooting
sessions supporting the ongoing work of the class.
Students are responsible for completing the required reading prior to class on
the relevant date.
