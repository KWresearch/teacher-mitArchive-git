Your journal is a place to reflect on the themes of the course, to integrate observations, 
experiences, and readings. It is a place to work on your personal story, to refine your own 
story in light of themes that emerged in class. Each week the journal should include a 
revised script for your personal story with a commentary, revisiting these questions: 
What is my story? What was presented/discussed in class this week? How did that change 
my story? Collectively, the journals, sent to the faculty via email each week by Sunday 
evening, suggest points of departure for class discussion on Mondays.
