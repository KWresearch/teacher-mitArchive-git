Two digital stories: a group story about Camfield Estates and the lessons it holds for 
designers and planners; a 3-5 minute-long personal story about how you perceive your 
role as a designer/planner in working with communities. The Camfield Estates story will 
be worked on in teams, which will be formed on the basis of individual proposals, 
interests, and skills. A draft of your personal story will be completed in the first three 
weeks of class, then revised, expanded, and refined throughout the semester.
