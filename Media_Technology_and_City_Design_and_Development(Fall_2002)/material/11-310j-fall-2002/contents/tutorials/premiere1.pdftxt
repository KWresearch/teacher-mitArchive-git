3)  DRAGGING MEDIA TO THE TIME LINE

Click and hold, drag to where you want to place the clip(s) in the timeline, and release.

4)  USING THE PLAYHEAD AND EDIT LINE 

To hear audio and view images that have been placed in the time line, move your cursor 
to the time ruler at the point in the project where you want to begin, and click once. 

A light blue playhead will appear in the time ruler with an edit line extending down 
through the timeline. Your monitor window will show whatever visual this edit line is 
passing through. 

Hit the spacebar to play. Notice that the playhead and edit line move and what you see 
and hear corresponds to whatever part of your project the edit line is passing through.

Hit the spacebar to stop. 

5)  THE BASIC EDIT: PLAY, LISTEN, STOP  - DRAG, DROP, REPEAT. 

Using the edit line will enable you to match your images to your voice in the first, basic 
edit of your project. 

Move the playhead and edit line to where your voice begins in the timeline. 

Hit the spacebar. Listen to your voice until you get to a point where you say a certain 
word and you know you want a certain image to appear. Hit the spacebar again to stop.

Find the image you want in your images bin and drag it down to “Video 1A” so that the 
image’s left edge is up against the edit line. 

Repeat these steps for your whole voice over and you’ve got a basic edit (don’t forget to 
save versions!).

6)  	 MOVING, EXTENDING, AND SHORTENING CLIPS WITHIN THE 
TIMELINE. 

After you’ve dragged and dropped things in the timeline, you may find that you want to 
move them or make them longer or shorter. 

To move a clip, make sure that your cursor is in the middle of the clip in the time line 
(not on either end!). 

Click and hold, and drag the clip to any open space. 

Release the mouse button to release the clip. 

To make a clip longer or shorter, move your cursor to the edge of the clip in the timeline; 
the cursor will become a red bracket. 

Click and hold, and move towards the other edge of the clip to make it shorter, 

or away from the other edge to make it longer.
