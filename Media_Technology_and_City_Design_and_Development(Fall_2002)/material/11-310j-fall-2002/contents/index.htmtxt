***** Course Highlights *****
This class teaches digital tools to urban designers, showing them how these
tools can be effective in their work in communities. It includes tutorials on
these tools, and a list of resources helpful to learning digital storytelling
techniques.
This class is run through the Center for Reflective Community Practice (CRCP),
which is the newest Center in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at
MIT. CRCP is built on the 25-year legacy of Mel King and the Community Fellows
Program at MIT.
Four central goals orient CRCP's work: helping people know what they know,
improving community practice through reflection and learning, building grounded
knowledge from reflection on practice, and developing tools and technology to
support this work. We have examined the last several years of work and
learning, and identified a set of questions that are critical for carrying out
these goals. Through two broad areas of work, direct work with communities, and
making practitioner knowledge accessible, we seek to advance our learning
around those questions. Over the next several years, we see CRCP moving to the
next level in our work: to function as a network of growing experience,
knowledge, and tools for helping struggling communities use their knowledge
resources as capital in the improvement of community life.
***** Course Description *****
This workshop explores the potential of media technology and the Internet to
enhance communication and transform city design and community development in
inner-city neighborhoods. The class introduces a variety of methods for
describing or representing a place and its residents, for simulating actions
and changes, for presenting visions of the future, and for engaging multiple
actors in the process of envisioning change and guiding action. Students will
engage one neighborhood, meet real people working on real projects, put theory
into practice, and reflect on insights gained in the process.
This year the course will examine what it means to be an urban designer/planner
and how to create a digital teaching tool (using digital storytelling) that
supports others in learning about the relationship between design and planning
professionals, on the one hand, and members of the communities they serve, on
the other. What is the nature of the knowledge that resides in a community and
how can designers and planners learn about, tap, and use that knowledge? What
is the relationship between community organizing and urban design and planning?
What are the relationships between you as a professional, the place(s) in which
you work, and the values and care you bring to that work?
We will explore these themes in the context of Camfield Estates in Lower
Roxbury, MA and its participation in the US Department of Housing and Urban
Development's (HUD) Demonstration Disposition Project. There have been many
stories written about Camfield Estates' participation in the Demonstration
Disposition project, for it has been widely regarded as a model of success.
There are two stories that have not yet been told, however: the story of the
residents who organized the community and the story of the architects and
planners who participated in the project. This course will use digital
storytelling to reconstruct and connect these two stories.
