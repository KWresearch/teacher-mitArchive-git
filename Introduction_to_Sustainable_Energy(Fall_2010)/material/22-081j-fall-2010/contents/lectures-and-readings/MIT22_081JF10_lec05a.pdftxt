Reality Today

• Not much energy storage in US electricity supply system

– Pumped storage is only 2% of entire generating capacity

• USA system uses excess capacity and dispatch to meet 
demand
demand

– Installed capacity is more than twice the average demand

• Lack of storage impedes large-scale deployment of 
intermittent sources

– Requires redundancy by conventional power plants

13

Storage demand requirements
– a multiscale challenge

• Electric power

– for non-grid distributed power 10 W to 100 MW
• battery back up for PV solar and wind, hybrid vehicles
• farm pumping and other remote applications
• low-head hydro storage
• UPS systems – kW to MW  for seconds to hours
• Thermal energy applications – kW to MW
– heating and cooling in buildings
– passive – solar residential 
– active systems – hot water and ice storage
– industrial process heating – 100 kWh to 100 MWh

Energy Storage for an HEV

• Batteries
– Lead-acid
– Lithium-ion
– Nickel-metal hydride
• Ultracapacitors
• Ultracapacitors
• Flywheels

Sustainable Energy - Fall 2010 - Storage

31

Energy Storage in HEV’s: 
Technical Challenges

• Low Specific Energy: Batteries are Heavy!
• Cycling Lifetime
– Many batteries lose capacity on each charge/discharge 
– Can ameliorate by not charging/discharging all the way
• Power Density 
– Existing batteries limit ability to absorb energy from regenerative 
braking
– Opportunities for super capacitors or flywheels
• Charging battery-only vehicles rapidly

Sustainable Energy - Fall 2010 - Storage

32

Environmental issues for energy storage

• Land use
– inundation caused by hydro projects
– thermal (hot/cold) island local effects
– underground storage systems have special 
geotechnical requirements to insure safe operation
geotechnical requirements to insure safe operation
• Materials toxicity disposal and recycle – e.g. batteries
• Durability and lifetime of entire system
• Emissions during manufacture and operation 

Sustainable Energy - Fall 2010 - Storage

33

Relevance of energy storage to sustainability

• Essential for effective use of intermittent renewable energy 
resources – including solar, wind, biomass, and hydro
• Storage can provide quality energy when it is needed
• Critical for high efficiency hybrid ICE/electric and fuel cell 
vehicles 
vehicles 
• Full life cycle environmental impacts must be considered in 
tradeoffs  -- especially for pumped hydro and batteries 
• Continuing advances in technology and deployment will lower 
costs to enable broader participation for electric and thermal  
storage at scales from 10 W to 100 kW for seconds to 100 
hours 
• Major innovations are needed for new systems to have an 
impact at largest scale (> 100 MW, >5 GWh)

There are many options for 
energy transport:

•For electricity   -- we have 
• wires (AC and DC) 
• For fossil fuels gas/oil/coal 
we have --
• pipelines 
• trains
• trucks 
• ships 
• ships 
• For hot or cold water, steam 
we have --
• pipelines   

Costs scale w ith directly w ith
distance; $0.20-$0.60/bbl/1000 mi for
oil; 10x more for electricity & coal.
Transport very significant cost for
coal & gas far from markets. LNG
affordable to ship by sea, but very 
expensive to liquefy in first place.

Energy transmission – scale and performance

(cid:1) Scale of energy transmission is Enormous!
(cid:1) 250,000 mi of gas pipelines of various sizes  in the US supply 
about 30 EJ per year
(cid:1) supertankers carry 200,000 to 300,000 ton (1.4 to 2.1 million bbl 
of oil)  payloads long distances very efficiently -- 2000+ miles  
(cid:1) Oil pipelines can extend for long distances (1000 or more 
miles) and have high capacity 
miles) and have high capacity 
e.g. max flow of 2.1 million bbl per day of crude over 900 miles 
in 1988 from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez, Alaska
(cid:1) 160,000+ miles of electric transmission lines in the US >250 kW
(cid:1) a unit train carries 100,000+ tons of coal.
(cid:1) Many options, but costs, energy consumption increase with distance

(cid:1) Environmental Impacts
-Oil Spills
(cid:1) Security, Political, and Right-of-Way issues      

Sustainable Energy - Fall 2010 - Storage

38

Additional transmission issues
• Security/Politics
– Russian gas pipelines to Europe
– How to get Caspian oil to market?
– Many places in world rely on a single pipeline.
– NIMBY concerns about shipping nuclear materials.
• Pipelines, LNG, Electric Grid, Rail require huge upfront 
• Pipelines, LNG, Electric Grid, Rail require huge upfront 
capital investments
– Investors taking a lot of risk, want guarantees
– Supply resource must last many years
• Often hard, expensive to secure right-of-way
– To add new power lines or rail into cities
– May not be worth it for small projects.
– Complex regulations and permitting for electric utilities, pipeline 
operations, rail.

Assessing Storage/Transmission Issues 
for New Energy Options: Stranded Gas

– Efficiency: 
ηgas-to-LNG(1-kshipdship)(1-kpipedpipe)ηgas-to-electricity(1-kwiredwire)
– Economics: net present value!
Cost: NPV of LNG plant, terminals, ships, 
Cost: NPV of LNG plant, terminals, ships, 
pipeline, power plant, transmission lines, plus 
cost of the gas, plus operating/maintenance
Revenue: NPV of the electricity
Size of resource is crucial: need many years of 
revenue to pay back the capital costs

Assessing Storage/Transmission Issues 
for New Energy Options: Biomass

• Efficiency:
(1-ktruckdtruck)ηbiomass-to-fuel(1-kpipedpipe)

Can dramatically improve efficiency by locating conversion 
plant next to waste heat source, but large losses in 
trucking biomass to this location.
trucking biomass to this location.
• Economics:
– Cost: NPV of conversion plant, trucks, pipeline, labor 
to collect biomass.
NOTE: will conversion plant be used year-round? If so, 
how to store the biomass from the harvest? If not, low 
utilization rate of conversion plant.
Revenue: NPV of delivered fuel stream
