“The  war  of  the  currents”


AC 

Pros  and  Cons 
One  kills  elephants 
One  has  simpler  infrastructure 
Why  do  we  have  AC  and  not 
DC? 
Look  at  a  simple  transmission 
circuit  to  decide. 
Use  Voltage=120  VDC  and 
Power=1.2  GW

Goals  of  the  analysis 
Find  the  generator  voltage 
Find  the  power  delivered  by  the  generator 
Find  the  power  dissipated  by  the  transmission  line

Efficiency  requires  most  power  is  dissipated  in

the  load


If  RT /RL  ￿ 1,  then 
PT  ￿ PL 
Most  of  the  voltage 
appears  across  the  load. 
So,  we  have  very  small 
transmission  losses. 

Example  for  Al  and  household  V 

For  PL  = 1.2  GW  and  VL  = 120V 
Then  RL  = PL/V 2  = 1.2 × 10−5Ω
L 
For  transmission  assume  L  =  50  km  (a

short  distance)

An  Aluminum  cable  with  A  =  5  cm2

(to  minimize  sag,  Cu  not  used.)

Resistivity  of  Al,  η = 2.8 × 10−8Ω-m

∴  RT  = ηL/A = 2.8Ω ￿ RL

Conclusion:  not  so  good!

AC  can  be  used  to  increase  the  voltage


AC 

Simple  circuit  models 

With  AC  we  can  use  transformers 
Step  up  the  voltage  at  the  generator 
Transmit  power  at  high  voltage,  low  current 
Step  down  the  voltage  at  the  load 
Transmitting  at  low  current  should  reduce  transmission  losses

For  N2  ￿ 1  a  huge  reduction  in 
transmission  losses

Practical  numbers: 

V0  = 12kV , V1  = 240kV  (rms)

This  implies  that  N1  = V1/V0  = 20 
Assume  small  voltage  drop  across  the 
transmission  line.  Then  V2  ≈ V1 
Second  turn  ratio  becomes 
N2  = V2/VL  = 2000 
Our  transmission  loss  formula  gives 
PT /PL  ≈ 6%

The  downside  to  AC:  Reactive  power


AC 

Reactive  power 

A  down  side  to  AC:  Reactive  power 
Why?  Load  is  not  pure  resistive 
Load  usually  has  an  inductive  component 
Resistance  absorbs  power 
Inductor  circulates  power  back  and  forth 
This  oscillating  power  is  the  reactive  power

AC 

Reactive  power 

For  parts  of  the  AC  cycle  the  instantaneous  power  is  greater  than  the

average  power 
Generator  must  be  able  to  deliver  this  higher  power  even  though  it  is 
returned  later 
Bottom  line:  generator  must  have  a  higher  volt-amp  rating  than 
average  power  delivered:  VARs  and Watts.

To  minimize  the  VA  requirements  on  the  generator  we  want  φ 
Assume  the  average  power  absorbed  by  the  load  is  ￿PL ￿ 
as  a  function  of  ￿PL ￿
Calculate  the  peak  generator  power  [PG (t )]

Note:  The  peak  is  2×  (rms  volt-amp  rating)

lags  are  opposite  for  inductance  and 
capacitance

tan φL  =  ω

Short  answer:  there  is  a  capacitance 
that  will  keep  the  current  and  voltage 
in  phase  (but  not  eliminate  the  power 
factor)
