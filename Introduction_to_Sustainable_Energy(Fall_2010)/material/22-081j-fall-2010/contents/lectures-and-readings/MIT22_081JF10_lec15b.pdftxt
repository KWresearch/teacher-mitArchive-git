Overview

Fusion 101

(cid:1) Fusion is a form of nuclear energy

(cid:1) Combines light elements (in our case, hydrogen  isotopes) to form 
heavier elements (He)

(cid:1) Releases huge amount of energy (multiple MeV/nucleon)

(cid:1) The reaction powers  the stars and produces the elements of the 
periodic table

(cid:1) For 50 years, scientists and engineers have been working  to 
exploit the fusion reaction as a practical energy source.

Long Term Goals

(cid:1) Produce baseload electricity in large power plants – 1 GWe/unit

(cid:1) At its simplest, a fusion reactor would be a “firebox” for 
conventional electricity generation. (Heat could be used in 
“off-peak” hours to make hydrogen  for transportation.)

Pros and Cons of Fusion

Pros

(cid:1) Abundant, high energy density fuel (D + Li)

(cid:1) No greenhouse gases (nor NOX, SOX, particulate emission)

(cid:1) Safe – no chain reaction, ~1 sec worth of fuel in device at any one time

(cid:1) Minimal “afterheat”, no nuclear meltdown possible

(cid:1) Residual radioactivity small; products immobile and short-lived
(cid:1) Residual radioactivity small; products immobile and short-lived

(cid:1) Minimal proliferation risks

(cid:1) Minimal land and water use

(cid:1) No seasonal, diurnal or regional variation – no energy storage issue

Cons

(cid:1) We don’t know how  to do it yet  (turns out to be a really hard problem)

(cid:1) Capital costs will be high, unit size large (but with low operating costs)

properties under intense neutron bombardment

 Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, Inspectability

DT Reaction Is Most Accessible Energetically

• Alpha particle : 2He4

==> Confined

==> Plasma Self Heating

• Neutron : 0n1

==> Not Confined

==> Energy output and

Tritium production

(Net Reaction is 1D2 + 3Li6 = 2 2He4)

11

SE - L17 Fusion Energy

Tritium Breeding Would Be Required

(cid:1) Deuterium is plentiful  ~ 0.015% of hydrogen

 Take 1 gallon water, extract D, fuse ⇒ energy equivalent to 
300 gallons gasoline

 Tritium decays rapidly, must be “manufactured”

(cid:1) Breeding reaction:  0n1 + 3Li6 = 1T3 + 2He4  (+ Energy)

 Overall, tritium is a catalyst for:    D2 +  Li6 =  He4 +  He4
 Overall, tritium is a catalyst for:   1D2 + 3Li6 = 2He4 + 2He4
Energy) 

(+ 
(+ 

 Li is plentiful in the earth’s crust

(cid:1) Tritium breeding ratio (TBR=tritons/neutron) must be bigger than 
1 to make up for geometrical limitations and natural decay

 There are endothermic reactions, for example 0n1 + 3Li7, 
which produce multiple neutrons.

 TBR ~ 1.05-1.1 is believed achievable.

The Physics Of The Fusion Reaction And Elastic 

Scattering Leads Us Directly To The Need For 

Confined Plasmas

(cid:1) Because scattering is much more likely, nuclei must be confined for many 
interaction times.

(cid:1) These multiple scatterings thermalize the constituent particles.

(cid:1) At the energies involved, matter becomes fully ionized ⇒ plasma.
(cid:1) At the energies involved, matter becomes fully ionized ⇒ plasma.

(cid:1) In all senses, we can think of plasmas as a 4th state of matter

In plasma physics, we measure temperature in eV

1 eV = 11,600 °°°°K              10 keV  ≈≈≈≈ 100 million degrees

magnetic fields

the science of plasma physics

What Are The World’s Energy Options

Nothing obviously easy

(cid:1) Burning fossil fuels (currently 80%) → climate change + pollution:
must see if large-scale CO2 capture and storage is possible, and can be 
made safe and cheap

(cid:1) Nuclear fission – safety, proliferation concerns (but cannot avoid if we 
are serious about reducing fossil fuel burning; at least until fusion 
available)
available)

(cid:1) Biofuels – can this be made carbon neutral?  Land and water use issues

(cid:1) Solar - need breakthroughs in production and storage

(cid:1) Wind, Tidal – storage and land use issues, but could fill niche

(cid:1) Fusion – environmentally benign, but success is not 100% certain

(cid:1) With so few good options, we should aggressively pursue all alternatives
Note: World’s energy costs approaching $10 Trillion/year

(cid:1) Magnetic field lines are helical and lie on closed, nested surfaces –
flux surfaces, Ψ = const.

(cid:1) Vertical ∇B drift averages to zero as particle follows helical field

(cid:1) To lowest order, particles are “stuck” on flux surfaces
