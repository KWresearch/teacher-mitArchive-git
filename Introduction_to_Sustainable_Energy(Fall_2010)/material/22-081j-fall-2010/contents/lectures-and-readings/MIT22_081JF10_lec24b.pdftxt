COMMON FEATURES OF CONVENTIONAL 
HYDROPOWER INSTALLATIONS  

Typical Hydroelectric Dam

Generators - Rotated by the 
turbines to generate electricity
Dam - Stores water

Transmission lines - Conduct 
electricity, ultimately to homes 
and businesses 

Penstock - Carries
water to the turbines

Cross section of conventional
hydropower facility that uses
an impoundment dam

Turbines - Turned by
the force of the water
on their blades

MAJOR ATTRIBUTES OF 
HYDROPOWER

Positive

Negative

Emissions-free, with virtually no CO2, NOx,
SOx, hydrocarbons, or particulates

Renewable resource with high conversion
efficiency to electricity (80%)
Dispatchable with storage capability

Usable for base load, peaking, and pumped
storage applications

Frequently involves impoundment of large
amounts of  water with loss of habitat due to 
land inundation

Variable output - dependent on rainfall and 
snowfall
Impacts on river flows and aquatic ecology,
including fish migration and oxygen depletion

Social impacts of displacing indigenous people

Scalable from 10 kWe to 10,000 MWe

Health impact in developing countries

Low operating and maintenance cost

High initial capital costs

Long lifetime - 50 years typical

Long lead time in construction in mega-sized projects

34

HYDRO POWER – ECONOMIC 
ISSUES
• Very capital intensive include “fuel costs”
• Large projects > 100 MWe have long lead times (4-6 yr)
• Long lifetimes and low operating and maintenance costs
• Large seasonal variation [factors of 2 to 10 in flow common]
• Costs very sensitive to natural terrain and climate e.g., compare 
• Costs very sensitive to natural terrain and climate e.g., compare 
Switzerland’s mountainous relief and high rainfall to the flatter, 
dryer Midwestern regions of the US
• Installed costs range from about $750/kW to $2000/kW for 
10-1000 MWe plants
• With intrinsic output variability need to inflate costs- typically 
range from $1500 to 6000 per reliable kilowatt

35

HYDRO POWER – ENVIRONMENTAL 
AND SOCIAL ISSUES

• Land Use – Inundation and Displacement of People
• Impacts on Natural Hydrology
 Infiltration

• Biological Effects
 Change in aquatic ecosystem – species change

 Damage to organisms passing through turbine

 Oxygen depletion downstream of dams

 Blockage of migration/breeding paths
 Blockage of migration/breeding paths

 Parasite growth

 Interruption of flooding cycles (silt, flood, transport)

 Increased temperature

• Is the Most Important Industrial-Scale Renewable Energy 
Technology
• Is Largely Opposed by “Green” Lobbies
 Opposition to new dams
 Decommissioning of existing dams
