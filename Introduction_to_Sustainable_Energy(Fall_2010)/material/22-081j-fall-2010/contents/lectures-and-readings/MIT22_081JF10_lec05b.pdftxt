Wind Power in History …

Brief History – Early Systems
Harvesting wind power is not a new idea –
sailing ships, wind-mills, wind-pumps

1st Wind Energy Systems
– Ancient Civilization in the Near East / Persia
– Vertical-Axis Wind-Mill: sails connected to a vertical 
shaft connected to a grinding stone for milling

Wind in the Middle Ages
– Post Mill Introduced in Northern Europe
– Horizontal-Axis Wind-Mill: sails connected to a 
horizontal shaft on a tower encasing gears and axles 
for translating horizontal into rotational motion

Wind in 19th century US
– Wind-rose horizontal-axis water-pumping wind-mills 
found throughout rural America

Brief History - Rise of Wind Powered Electricity

Please see Heimpel, L. G. "How To Convert an Old Auto
 Generator into a Wind-Driven Battery Charger." Popular Science
123 (August 1933): 68, 76. (View on Google Books.)

1888: Charles Brush builds first large-size wind 
electricity generation turbine (17 m diameter 
wind rose configuration, 12 kW generator)

1890s: Lewis Electric Company of New York 
sells generators to retro-fit onto existing wind 
mills

1920s-1950s: Propeller-type 2 & 3-blade 
horizontal-axis wind electricity conversion 
systems (WECS)

1940s – 1960s: Rural Electrification in US and 
Europe leads to decline in WECS use

Wind Physics Basics …

Origin of Wind
Wind – Atmospheric air 
in motion 

Energy source
Solar radiation differentially 
absorbed by earth surface 
converted through convective 
processes due to temperature 
differences to air motion

Spatial Scales
Planetary scale: global circulation
Synoptic scale: weather systems
Meso scale: local topographic or 
thermally induced circulations
Micro scale: urban topography

– Jet stream
– Trade winds
– Polar jets

• Geostrophic winds
• Thermal winds
• Gradient winds 

• Katabatic / Anabatic  winds – topographic winds
• Bora / Foehn / Chinook – downslope wind storms

Fundamentals of Wind Power …
Wind Power Fundamentals …

Fundamental Equation of Wind Power
– Wind Power depends on:
• amount of air (volume) 
• speed of air (velocity) 
• mass of air (density)
flowing through the area of interest (flux) 
– Kinetic Energy definition:
• KE = ½ * m * v 2
– Power is KE per unit time:
m
• P = ½ *      * v 2
– Fluid mechanics gives mass flow rate
(density * volume flux):
mm
d

= ρ* A * v
•
dt
– Thus:
• P = ½ * ρ * A * v 3

v

A

• Power ~ cube of velocity
• Power ~ air density
• Power ~ rotor swept area A= πr 2

Efficiency in Extracting Wind Power

Betz Limit & Power Coefficient:

• Power Coefficient, Cp, is the ratio of power extracted by the turbine 
to the total contained in the wind resource Cp = PT/PW
• Turbine power output
PT = ½ * ρρρρ * A * v 3 * Cp

• The Betz Limit is the maximal possible Cp = 16/27
• The Betz Limit is the maximal possible Cp = 16/27

• 59% efficiency is the BEST a conventional wind turbine can do in 
extracting power from the wind

Please see Betz' Law, Danish Wind Industry Association.

Power Curve of Wind Turbine
Capacity Factor (CF): 
• The fraction of the year the turbine generator is operating at 
rated (peak) power 
Capacity Factor = Average Output / Peak Output ≈ 30%

• CF is based on both the characteristics of the turbine and the 
site characteristics (typically 0.3 or above for a good site)

Nacelle, Rotor & Hub

2.

• Main Rotor Design Method (ideal 
case):
1. Determine basic configuration: 
orientation and blade number
take site wind speed and desired 
power output
3. Calculate rotor diameter (accounting 
for efficiency losses)
for efficiency losses)
4. Select tip-speed ratio (higher 
more complex airfoils, noise) and 
blade number (higher efficiency with 
more blades)
5. Design blade including angle of 
attack, lift and drag characteristics
6. Combine with theory or empirical 
methods to determine optimum 
blade shape

Teetered Hubs:

• Pitch

control of wind turbines, Danish Wind Industry Association.(cid:13)(cid:10)

Electrical Generator

• Generator:
– Rotating magnetic field induces current

Please see Synchronous machines and No. of poles, Danish Wind Industry Association.

• Synchronous / Permanent Magnet Generator
– Potential use without gearbox
– Historically higher cost (use of rare-earth metals)

• Asynchronous / Induction Generator
– Slip (operation above/below synchronous speed) possible
– Reduces gearbox wear
Masters, Gilbert, Renewable and Efficient Electric Power Systems, W iley-IEEE Press, 2003 
http://wiki.windpower.org/index.php/No._of_poles .

Control Systems & Electronics

• Control methods
– Drivetrain Speed

• Fixed (direct grid connection) and 
Variable (power electronics for 
indirect grid connection)
– Blade Regulation

• Stall – blade position fixed, angle 
of attack increases with wind 
speed until stall occurs behind 
blade

• Pitch – blade position changes 
with wind speed to actively 
control low-speed shaft for a 
more clean power curve

Wind Grid Integration

• Short-term fluctuations and forecast error
• Potential solutions undergoing research:
– Grid Integration: Transmission Infrastructure, 
Demand-Side Management and Advanced 
Controls
– Storage: flywheels, compressed air, batteries, 
pumped-hydro, hydrogen, vehicle-2-grid (V2G)
