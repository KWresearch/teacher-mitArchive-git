First law: conservation of heat plus work

• Heat (Q) and work (W) are forms of 
energy.
• Energy can neither be created or 
destroyed.

• Applies to energy (J, BTU, kW-hr,

• Work comes in several forms:

Converting  heat  and work 

•	 In theory various forms of work can be 
interconverted with high efficiency (i.e. without 
making a lot of heat): 
–	 Kinetic, mgh, electricity 
–  In practice it is difficult to efficiently convert some 
types of work: chemical/nuclear/light tend to make a 
lot of heat during conversions.
lot of heat during conversions. 
•	 Work can easily be converted to heat with high 
efficiency: 
–  Electrical resistance heaters, friction, exothermic 

reactions (e.g. combustion, nuclear reactions)

•	 Impossible to convert Heat to Work with high 
efficiency: 
–  Coal plants (~35%), nuclear plants (~35%), natural 
gas plants (~50%), automobiles (~20%) 

Entropy  (S)  and  the  second  law  of 
thermodynamics

Free  Energy  and  Exergy:  Measures  of 
How  Much  Chemical  Energy  is 
potentially  available  to  do  work 
•	 Usual measure of ability to do work: Free energy 
G = H – TS = U + PV - TS

Tcooling, ~300 K), and a min pressure (e.g. Pmin  = 1 atm)

•	 Call G-TcoolingS – PminV  the “exergy”: how much chemical 
energy going in to a device is available to do work. 
•	 Should also consider the lowest-chemical-energy products 
(e.g. H2O and CO2), not ordinary standard states of enthalpy 
(H2, O2, graphite). 
•	 A ton of room temperature air has quite a lot of thermal 
energy, but none of that energy can be converted into work.

In most  Heat  Engines, Work  extracted  as  PdV


•	 Boiling a liquid under pressure: big volume change, 
lots of W = ∫PdV 
•  Turbines, pistons extract mechanical work from the

pressurized gas by a nearly adiabatic expansion:

•	 Would like to arrange so that Plo~ 1 atm, Tlo  ~ lowest 
feasible temperature 
–	 Low T good for Carnot efficiency 
–	 If we exhaust the gas, don’t want to waste enthalpy 
–	 T, P both drop in expansion, but at different rates 

Impractical  to  arrange  ideal  Phi,  Thi 

•	 Material limits on pressure, temperature 
–	 Steam cycles confined to relatively low Thi 
•	 Internal Combustion Engines, Turbines 
–	 Exhaust tends to be too hot (T(  lo  >> ambient) )
– Exhaust tends to be too hot T >> ambient
lo 
–  A lot of energy carried away as waste heat in the 
exhaust (LHV, exergy analysis). So despite high Thi, 
these are usually much less efficient than Carnot.

cycles.

Heat and power are often 
produced together to maximize 
the use of otherwise wasted 
heat. 

•	 Topping cycles produce 
electricity from high T, and use

Conclusions 

1.	 Heat plus work is conserved (from the First Law). 

2.	 Heat can’t be converted to work with 100% efficiency 
(from the Second Law). 

3.	 Real processes suffer from non-idealities which 
generally keep them from operating close to their 
thermodynamic limits (from real life, plus the Second 
Law)
.
Law). 

4.	 Chemical, nuclear energy in principle are “work”, but 
most practical devices convert them into heat, then use 
heat engines to extract PdV work: Carnot limit 

5.	 Careful accounting for energy/exergy and the limits on 
what is possible is necessary for assessing new energy 
proposals. Relatively easy to do, and the results are 
much more solid and exact than other aspects of the 
problem like financing, economics, marketing, politics.
