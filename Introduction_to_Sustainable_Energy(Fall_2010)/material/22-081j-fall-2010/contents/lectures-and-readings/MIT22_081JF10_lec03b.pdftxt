Energy Sustainability issues
– What is “sustainability?”
– How does energy use impact sustainability?
– What are the problems with present energy 
use?
– What are global challenges for the future of 
energy use?

What is Sustainability?

• The ability of humanity to ensure that it meets the needs of the
present without compromising the ability of future generations 
to meet their own needs. [Bruntland, 1987]*
• Preservation of productive capacity for the foreseeable future. 
[Solow, 1992]
• Biophysical sustainability means maintaining or improving the 
integrity of the life support system of earth.  [Fuwa, 1995]
• A dynamic harmony between the equitable availability of 
energy-intensive goods and services to all people and the 
preservation of the earth for future generations [Tester, et al.
2005]

How does energy use impact sustainability?
• Some Benefits
– Energy is critical to human survival and development
– Fossil fuels are plentiful and convenient to use
– Energy is key to industrialization and transportation
– Energy facilitates economic growth and globalization
• Some Problems
– Rapid growth in fossil fuel use raises concerns about:
• Security of supply (over-dependence?)
• Environmental impacts
• Societal conflicts over inequitable distribution of 
resources
• Depletion of critical resources

What are the problems with
present energy use?
• Global Energy consumption is growing because:
– Population is growing
– Energy use per capita is growing – especially in developing 
countries
• Growing megacities need concentrated energy sources
• Transportation systems depend largely on petroleum fuels
• Major fossil energy sources have problems
– Security of supply/price stability (esp. petroleum)
– Depletion 
– Climate impacts from greenhouse gas emissions
• Energy access is unequally distributed
• Global economy is significantly dependent on present fossil 
energy prices and availability – changes to include “externality”
costs may slow economic growth (or at least cause major short-
term disruptions in the economy)

Intragenerational Principles

• Reduce gross inequities between the poorest and wealthiest 
both nationally and globally
– Meet the basic needs of the poorest with food, shelter, health care, 
clean water, access to electricity, education, opportunity for work, 
etc.
– Avoid exploitation of poorer country/region resources and labor 
to create even greater wealth for the richest
• Provide ways to protect the common good (social, 
environmental, economic) locally and globally through national 
and international governance/cooperation
– Preserve natural ecosystems against unconstrained development
– Avoid interference with natural balances in the atmosphere, the 
oceans, and the arctic regions
– Maintain stable institutions that protect human rights, adjudicate 
conflicts, and allow responsible trade and market economy 
activities

Intergenerational Principles
What are our obligations to future generations?

• Trustee:  Every generation has an obligation to 
protect the interests of future generations
• Chain of obligation:  Primary obligation is to 
provide for the needs of the living and succeeding 
generations.  Near term concrete hazards have 
priority over long term hypothetical hazards
• Precautionary Principle: Do not pursue actions that 
pose a realistic threat of irreversible harm or 
catastrophic consequences unless there is some 
compelling or countervailing need to benefit either 
current or future generations

Are There Limits to Growth?

• Malthus – 1798* – Population grows exponentially; food 
production grows linearly.  Population growth ceases when 
incremental person doesn’t have resources to survive
• Hardin – 1968 – Tragedy of the Commons
• Ehrlichs – 1968 – Overpopulation is the problem, depleting soils 
and disrupting natural life support ecosystems
• Forrester – 1972 – Limits to Growth – potential for disaster 
within 100 years
• Meadows – 1992 – Beyond the Limits – overshoot but human 
ingenuity could prevent collapse
• Cohen – 1995 – How many people can Earth support? (maybe a 
trillion, more likely around 16 billion)

Climate Change Concerns

• Global energy demand is growing and is over 80% of primary 
energy is supplied by fossil fuel today
• Combustion of fossil fuel generates greenhouse gases –
predominately CO2 – that can lead to global warming and 
associated impacts (melting of glaciers and polar ice, sea level
rise, changes in local rainfall and climates, increases in storm
severity, impacts on biosphere and agriculture, changes in ocean
circulation, etc.)
• Methane, CH4, is also a GHG and reaches the atmosphere 
through agricultural activities and leakage
• There is no “silver bullet” replacement for fossil fuels

Other Energy Sources all have pros and cons

• Nuclear:  can provide concentrated power, but there are 
concerns about waste management and proliferation
• Solar-based Renewables (solar, wind, hydro, biomass): 
require large land areas for collection because of the lower 
energy intensity of sunlight
• Geothermal:  Deep access is needed in most areas to reach 
high enough temperatures for efficient power production
• Fossil with carbon capture and sequestration: energy penalty 
for processing and concerns about long-term CO2 storage 
integrity

Trends and Issues
• Population growth still increasing though slowing.  Some 
OECD countries may actually see a populations decline without 
immigration
Increasing electrification in all sectors except transportation –
which remains oil dependent
• Existing energy technology infrastructure is in place; this is a
barrier to competition from new sources
• Growing concerns about “externalities:”
– Global climate change
– Economic and societal instabilities
– Resource depletion
– Land impacts
• Worldwide dependence on low cost fossil fuels makes it difficult
to raise prices over a short time span – could change trade 
patterns significantly
• China’s rapid growth and motorization are creating growing 
demands for new petroleum production and refining

Economic Impacts and Costs
• From: UK Economic Service Assessment:  
“Stern Review Report on the Economics of Climate Change”
(October 2006)
– Costs associated with unabated climate change are estimated 
to be at least 5% of GDP/year
– Other impacts such as economic effects on human life and the 
environment and differential impacts on the poor  could raise 
estimates to 20% of GDP per year or more.
– Each tonne of CO2 emitted now causes damage worth at least 
$85
– Many emissions reduction opportunities cost less than 
$25/TCO2
– Tackling climate change soon is a long term growth path – the 
status quo will ultimately undermine economic growth

Policy Changes for Effective Response

From:  UK Economic Service Assessment:  
“Stern Review Report on the Economics of Climate Change” (October 
2006)
Progress will require:
– Carbon pricing (taxation, emission trading, regulation) to build a 
common global carbon price that includes full social costs of use
– Technology policy to drive the development and large-scale 
deployment at scale of low-carbon and high-efficiency products
– Policies that remove barriers to energy efficiency and inform, 
educate, and persuade individuals about what they can do to 
facilitate the transition
Need consistent global policy, guided by understanding of long-term 
goals, with strong frameworks for international cooperation.

The Energy Challenge

• If we have to change our energy technologies over 
a relatively short period of time, where are the best 
alternatives?
• How should we invest in developing better 
alternatives?
• What are the drivers that will encourage timely 
development and market penetration of these 
technologies?

• Do we also have to change behaviors?

Some Barriers
• Most people don’t like change unless it will improve their life 
now
• Changing energy sources will entail additional costs, will upset
present economic balances, will create winners and losers, and 
may slow economic growth in the short term
• Most people have a preference for short over long term gain, 
especially if the long term gain is intangible
• We have trouble assessing the value of “externalities” – and the 
value may not be uniform among nations or regions
• Moving to more expensive energy sources will force us to use less 
energy and perhaps to forgo some habits we have come to like 
(e.g., SUVs in the US) – and will differentially impact the poor
• Our leaders are reluctant to do anything that may hurt major 
industries or the economy – unless there is a compelling reason to 
do so
• Most Americans are unaware of the rapid industrialization and 
growth of China - and its competition in global markets for 
petroleum and other resources

Mitigating Climate Change:
Progress - How Far and How Fast?

• Gaming – Wait for the “other guy:”
– Developed countries go first; Kyoto modest start
– Each country wishes to preserve or improve 
economic status
– US administration backed away from the Kyoto 
Protocol and looks to a variety of voluntary 
initiatives
• Result – INACTION!
• BUT:  Evidence of climate change is increasing and 
public awareness is rising, even in the US

Addressing Poverty:
How Far and How Fast?

• Gaps between rich and poor still widening
• Cultural and religious values influence attitudes
• Energy/electricity access help improve life of the poorest
• Selfishness and denial
– Developed world (especially the U.S.) – view that poverty is 
self-inflicted, limited social services aimed at reacting to 
problems rather than to correcting them, unwillingness to 
share enough domestically, much less internationally
– Developing countries – desire for better quality of life among 
both the richer and the poorer, graft and corruption, 
acceptance of large inequities, inadequate resources (human 
and financial) for much change, anger at the “haves” – who 
are even more visible now thanks to modern communications 

Consequences of Inaction
• Climate change 
– Shifting regional weather patterns impacting ecosystems, 
agriculture, water, storms, floods, etc.
– Impacts of warming about double the average at the poles
– Most human impact on the poor – wealthy countries can 
better afford mitigation
• Poverty
– Subhuman living conditions for many; ill-health, addiction, 
crime, mass migration, etc.
– Loss of human capital and environmental degradation
• Major societal inequities
– Economic conflicts and disruptions
– Institutional instabilities
– “Fortress World” for the rich?  Terrorism? Wars?

Some considerations…

• There is no right or wrong – it is a matter of balance
• Each one may contribute in a different way
• Selfishness and materialism are OK in moderation, 
but may block other rewarding human values like 
being of service to others, feeling part of a 
community, self respect, love, and compassion
• We can only control our behavior – not other 
people’s (though it is possible to be an example)

Rewards of Action

• Perhaps a better quality of life with enough to meet 
our needs – not our wants!
• A different business paradigm – not mass 
production, but life cycle service production with 
careful regard for externalities
• Greatly reduced social inequity and improved 
societal stability
• Appreciation and care for nature and diversity, both 
human and environmental 
• A balance between self-care and the good feeling 
from giving our share as part of a healthy 
community and world

What can we do?

• In our daily living?
• In choosing careers?
• In our professional lives?
• As private citizens?
• As national citizens?
• As global citizens?
How much are we willing to do?
