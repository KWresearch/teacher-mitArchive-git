Fundamentals of System Dynamics

• Basics of System Dynamics Modeling
– A system of Differential Equations solved using 
numerical techniques at a sequence of time-steps 
with complex feedback relationships between system 
variables

• Key Components are:
• Key Components are:
– Simulation model (not optimization model)

• Breaks down assumptions related to optimization 
(rationality of decision-makers, monetized / 
utilitarian value maximization)

• Often involves economic, technical AND social 
phenomena

Fundamentals of System Dynamics

• Key Components are:
– Goal-seeking behavior that drives model decision-
making

• Technical systems behave according to physical 
characteristics

• Economic and social systems can behave 
• Economic and social systems can behave 
according to different decision-making frameworks

– Rational utility maximization

– Boundedly rational decision-making (with 
potential delays, lack of information, etc)

– Heuristics

Fundamentals of System Dynamics

• Key Components are:
– Closed System Boundary: 
• Must capture variables relevant to system behavior and structure
• Can be as quite broad (always a challenge with this type of 
model)
• Flexibility in deciding what is endogenous (inside system 
boundary) and what is exogenous (outside system boundary)

Policy

Technology 
development 
and innovation

Weather 
and climate

Endogenous to 
system: electricity 
demand, supply, 
transmission

Fuel prices

What should be 
Exogenous to 
electric grid 
system?

Fundamentals of System Dynamics

• Key Components are:
– Variable separation into stocks (accumulation over time) and 
flows (auxiliary variables)
– Feedback and delays: relationships between variables are non-
linear and involve both physical and informational delay 
processes
• Negative Feedback Loops (Balancing)
• Negative Feedback Loops (Balancing)

• Positive Feedback Loops (Reinforcing)

Fundamentals of System Dynamics

• A more complex SD Model Archetypes:
– Diffusion and Innovation (the Bass diffusion model)
– Who are the potential adopters of a given product (think 
consumer products such as iphones)?
– What influences them to adopt a product?

SD Models and Energy

• Series of System Dynamic Models in Energy
– Early 1970s: development of FOSSIL1/FOSSIL2 displaces use 
of “Project Independence Evaluation System” PIES
– 1978 ~ 1995, FOSSIL2/IDEAS (Integrated Dynamic Energy 
Analysis Simulation) used widely for energy policy evaluation
– Mid-1990s, Energy Information Administration introduces 
National Energy Modeling System to replace FOSSIL2 model

Review of Some Models on Wind and Diffusion

• Electric sector 
model for capacity 
expansion
– Looks at shifting 
electricity demand 
profile and 
generation asset mix 
over time
– Includes different 
time-scales of 
interest (hours, days, 
months and years)
– Includes endogenous 
demand elasticity, 
technology learning 
and economies of 
scale

Review of Some Models on Wind and Diffusion

• Few System Dynamics Models focused on Diffusion and 
Incorporation of Renewables into Electricity Sector

• Combine capacity expansion framework with diffusion 
framework for new technology (i.e. Dyner 2006)
– Adds influence of different exogenous policy mechanisms
– Some attempt at estimating R&D spending influence on costs
– Scope trade-off: detailed model of specific technology versus 
– Scope trade-off: detailed model of specific technology versus 
large interactions across system variables

SD Models and Renewables

• Why diffusion framework?
– Adoption of new technologies: wind energy, solar power, 
distributed generation, electric vehicles, storage

• What caveats?
– Complex interaction with larger technical system

• Potential solutions?
– Combine with optimization based models such as economic-
based capacity expansion models (two interconnected models)
– Bring technical complexities into a diffusion model for the 
technology (try to capture system interaction within system 
dynamics space)

Revisiting wind energy

• Historically inconsistent US federal policy for wind 
energy
– Periodic expiration of Production Tax Credit (PTC) in 1999, 
2001, and 2003 cause collapse in industry growth
– Financial crisis in 2009 diminish viability of PTC causing shift of 
emphasis by AWEA towards national renewable electricity

Simple Diffusion Model for Wind Energy 

• Basic Model Design:
– Bass diffusion model using word of mouth and direct advertising 
substituted: 
• primary reinforcing loop (increased familiarity with wind technology) 

• primary balancing loop (depletion of high wind resource sites 
profitable for development)
– Policy, electricity price, costs and demand treated as exogenous

(Demo of simple wind diffusion model)

Wind Energy Diffusion Model Development

• Endogenous Factors:
– Learning curve and 
technology improvement
– Both utility and 
community acceptance
– Electricity prices
– System costs
– System costs
– System integration
– Land-use
– Industry capacity

• Sub-model 
development for each 
area
