Ethanol  is made  by  yeast when  no  oxygen  is 
present. 

If oxygen  is available, cells use it ­

C6H12O6  + 6 O2 → 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + (36 or 38) ATP

Biodiesel  is  a  pretty  good  fuel. Where  does  it 
come  from? Why  don’t  we  use more  of  it? 

•  Feedstock:  oil  crops,  used  cooking  oil,  etc. 

•  Problem  is  SCALE,  use  of  farmland  or  rainforest: 
–	 Oil  Palm:  600  gallons/acre/yr 
•	 Replacing  Asian  rainforest  with  oil  palm  plantations 
to  meet  EU  biodiesel  demand. 
–	 Rapeseed  (Canola):  127  gallons/acre/yr 
–	 Soybeans:  48  gallons/acre/yr 
– Soybeans: 48 gallons/acre/yr
•	 If  you  sell  it  for  $2/gallon,  that  is  only  $96/year 
for  use  of  an  acre  of  farm  land. 

•  Future  directions: 
–	 Bacteria,  yeast  can  convert  sugars  to  lipids:  make  biodiesel 
from  cellulose? 
–  Industry,  airlines  would  like  to  take  O  out  of  biodiesel: 
Thermal  decarboxylation;  thermal  hydrodeoxygenation 

Bioenergy  as  Goal  or  Bioenergy  as  Byproduct 

•	 Historically,  biomass  products  (food, 
lumber)  have  been  considered  more 
valuable  than  biomass  energy. 
•	 Existing  policies  and  practices  focus  on 
agriculture,  lumber,  land  use,  etc.;  only 
waste  or  surplus  biomass  used  as  energy. 
waste or surplus biomass used as energy.
•	 Focus  needs  to  shift  for  biomass  to 
become  important  on  global  energy  scale. 
•	 Last  year’s  food  price  shocks  and  food 
riots  have  raised  awareness  of  the  issues… 

Most  biomass  conversion  techniques  are  put  in

two main  camps. 

Biological 
–	 Using microbes  to  convert 
biomass  to  fuels 
•	 Pros 
–	 Can  make  chemicals  with 
high  specificity 
–	 Works  well  in  aqueous 
media  at  reasonable 
media at reasonable
temperatures  and 
temperatures and
pressures 
•	 Cons 
–	 Requires  specific  chemical 
inputs  (sugar) 
–	 Low  throughput 
•	 Examples: 
–  Ethanol,  CH4,  butanol 

Thermochemical

–	 Using  traditional  chemical 
processing  methods 
•	 Pros 
–	 Often  doesn’t  require 
chemical  specificity  of 
feedstocks 
–	 Higher  throughput 
g 
g  p
– Hi her throu h ut
•	 Cons 
–	 Extreme  T,  P  may  be 
needed 
–	 Subject  to  catalyst  fouling, 
inorganic  precipitation 
•	 Examples 
–	 Biodiesel,  syngas,  CH4,  H2, 
diesel,  gasoline 

Advanced  fermentation  techniques  may 
produce  better  fuels  from  cheaper  feedstocks. 

•  Better  fuels 
–  butanol,  propanol,  etc. 
–  high  lipids 
–  hydrocarbon  excretion 

•  Better  feedstock  utilization 
–  Cheaper  enzymes 
–  Lynd’s  single­pot  technique 
–  Syngas:  H2,  CO

to make ‘green’ diesel.

Neste Oil and UOP use refinery techniques:
• catalytic saturation
• hydrodeoxygenation
• decarboxylation
• hydroisomerization

Biofuel  conversions:  some  take­away  points. 

1.	 Don't  invent  new  fuels,  find  ways  to make  existing  fuels 
from  biomass.  If  you  want  to make  a  new  fuel,  need  to 
demonstrate  it  has  big  performance  advantages  over 
existing  fuels. 

2.	

Chemically,  the  goal  is  oxygen  removal.

handle  water  intelligently.  Biosynthesis  of  water­insoluble 
fuels  greatly  reduces  separation  costs. 

There  exists  enough  waste  biomass  to  supply  about  25% 
of  the  demand  for  liquid  fuels.  However,  it  is  widely 
distributed  over  the  globe.  Big  unresolved  questions 
about  economics,  land  use,  policy,  as  well  as  which 
conversion  technologies  are  best.
