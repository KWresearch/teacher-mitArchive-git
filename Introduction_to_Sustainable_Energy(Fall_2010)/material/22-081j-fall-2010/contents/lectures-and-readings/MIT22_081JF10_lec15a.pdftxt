• Proliferation (i.e., Diversion and Misuse) Controlled Relying Heavily 
• Proliferation (i.e., Diversion and Misuse) Controlled Relying Heavily 
upon Safeguards
• Current International Safeguards Arrangements Could be Improved 
Substantially via Greater Funding
• Breakout (NPT Abrogation) Scenarios Dominate Proliferation Risks, 
are Not Currently Well Protected Against
• Management of Breakout Risks Demands New International 
Arrangements for
