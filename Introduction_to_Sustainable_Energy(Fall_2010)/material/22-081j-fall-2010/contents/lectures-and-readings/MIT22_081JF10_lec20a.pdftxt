So, we want to increase efficiency while 
 

meeting design goals 
 


1.  Reduce load (energy required at 
the wheels) 

2.  Increase powertrain efficiency 
1.  Increase efficiency of engine 
2.  Shift engine operating points 
3.  Use smaller engine (downsize)

Reducing the load at the wheels reduces 
 
fuel consumption 
 

•  Reduce weight 

•  Reduce aerodynamic drag 

•  Reduce accessory loads 

� �

These reductions also 
 

allow for downsizing

concept car and Siuru, Bill. "5 Facts: Vehicle Aerodynamics."

Diesel engines are more efficient, but 
heavier and more expensive 

Compression Ignition (vs. Spark Ignition) 
• 	 Only air is compressed 
– 	Higher compression ratio 
• 	 Fuel is injected into the compressed air 
and self-ignites 
– 	Direct injection 

Diesel (vs. Gasoline) Fuel 
• 	 Higher energy content 
• 	 Higher emissions from combustion

Corporate Average Fuel Economy 

� Administered by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(NHTSA, part of the DOT) 

� Sets minimum average level of fuel economy that new light-
duty* vehicles sold by each manufacturer must meet each year 

� Fuel economy is based on a test procedure from the 1970s 
� ~30% higher than real-world values or “window sticker” estimates 
* Light-Duty means a gross vehicle weight rating ≤ 8,500 lbs.

Corporate Average Fuel Economy 

Some Details 
� Electric Vehicle Credited MPG = (Energy-Equivalent MPG) / 0.15 
� Credits for overcompliance can be “banked” from past 5 years or 
“borrowed” from next 3 years 
� Flexible-fuel and bi-fuel vehicles capable of using alternative fuels 
earn ~60% bonus credit on fuel economy rating 
� Total benefit capped at 1.2 mpg each year 
� Penalty for noncompliance = $55/mpg/vehicle 

11/18/10

Corporate Average Fuel Economy 

Recent Changes 
� NHTSA now required to set attribute-based standards 
� Different standards for each manufacturer, based on product mix 
� Intended to reduce equity issues of regulatory cost 
� Effectively negates downsizing as a compliance strategy 
� Credits can now be traded between fleets and between 
manufacturers 
� Subject to certain restrictions

Corporate Average Fuel Economy 

How Standards are Set 
� Cost-benefit analysis including discounted lifetime fuel expenses, 
estimated technology costs, monetized values of non-financial 
costs and benefits 
� Applies efficiency-enhancing technologies in order of cost 
effectiveness, subject to judgment-based constraints 
� Equalizes marginal cost of more technology with marginal benefit

Vehicle GHG Standards 

� (2002) “Pavley” GHG standards required by California Assembly 
Bill 1493, to be implemented by California Air Resources Board 
� 13 other states opt in to California’s standards under Clean Air Act 
provisions 
� (2004) Auto manufacturers, trade associations, dealers sue, 
citing principle that GHG regulation is tantamount to fuel 
economy regulation, explicitly preempted by CAFE law 
� (2007) Supreme Court rules in Massachusetts v EPA that GHGs 
are pollutants under the Clean Air Act 
� (2007) Bush Administration denies California “waiver” from 
federal preemption (waiver needed to implement regulations) 
� (2009) Obama administration grants waiver, brokers truce 
between manufacturers and states, announces harmonized state 
& federal standards. Dealers continue to sue.

Vehicle GHG Standards 
 


Electric vehicles 
assumed to have zero 
emissions, up to first 
200,000-300,000 
produced. 

Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 186 / Monday, September 28, 2009 / Proposed Rules 

11/18/10

Gasoline Taxes 

� 10% increase in fuel price � 3.3% increase in MPG (long term) 
� To go from 26 � 35 MPG: 
� Need gas to go from $2/gal to ~$5/gal 
� Annual gasoline bill increases by ~$1000/year for new cars
� Annual gasoline bill increases by ~$1800/year for older cars

Other Policies 

� Feebates 
� Fee + Rebate, purchase incentive system 
� Greater cost certainty, less emissions certainty relative to CAFE 
� Recently adopted in France, initial results promising 
� Cap & Trade 
� Would effectively be a gas tax 
� $10 / tonne CO2 ~ $0.10 / gallon 
� Cash for Clunkers 
� Not energy/carbon policy 
� $200+ per ton of avoided emissions (Knittel, 2009) 
� More effective if goals are criteria pollutant emissions 
� Maybe effective as economic stimulus
