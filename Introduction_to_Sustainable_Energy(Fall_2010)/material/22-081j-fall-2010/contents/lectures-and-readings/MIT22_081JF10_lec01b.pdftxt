Selecting  solutions 

It’s  a  hodge-podge 
Are  all  problems  being  addressed? 
Are  alternatives  compared by  means of a  cost-beneﬁt  analysis? 
Are we  providing  sufﬁcient  funds for  R&D  innovations? 
Does  the  media  do  a  good  job  informing  the  public?

Hydrogen   is  not  a  naturally   occurring  fuel  
There  are  no hydrogen  mines 
It   must  be   manufactured  - it’s  an  energy  carrier

Basic   problems  are  tough

Takes  considerable  energy  to   produce hydrogen.

Difﬁcult   to  transpor t  .

Expensive  to  transpor t.

Energy  density is low:  vs. for  gasoline.

Fossil  fuels 

Put   the  fuel  in  a  tank  and  light  a  match 
All fossil  fuels  use oxygen to burn 
All fossil  fuels  produce  large  amounts of  CO2 
All fossil  fuels  produce  some  amount of  pollution due to impurities 
Basic   chemical   reactions:

C + O2  → CO2  + heat

Coal 
CH4  + 2O2  → CO2  + 2H2O + heat 
Gas 
C8H18  + 12.5O2  → 8CO2  + 9H2O + heat

We  are  running  out  of  gas  and  oil   - US  oil  production  peaked  in 
1970. 
Much  of  the  supply  is   in  unstable  par ts  of  the  world. 
We  have  a  good  amount  of  coal. 
All fossil  fuels  produce  large  amounts of  CO2,  which is a

greenhouse  gas.

Carbon   sequestration is not yet a proven  technology.

Hydro 

Put your  paddle   wheel  into  ﬂowing water 
Attach   the  shaft  of  the  wheel  to  a  generator 
Voila - electricity 
Main  source of  energy is gravity  
Key power   relation is given by: 

Power  =(hydraulic  head)(ﬂow  rate)(efﬁciency) 
=ρgh[J/m3 ] × Q [m3/s] × η [%] 

Implied  power   density   is   low.  Hydraulic  head  is  0.27  kWh/m3  at 
100m. 
Need  large  reservoirs   to  store  water  (power  density  ~3  W/m2 )

Peak  normal  solar  irradiance  is   1kW/m2  (at   surface,  1.366  kW  at 
top  of  atmosphere,  known  as  the  solar  constant) 
The  sun’s  energy  can  make  electricity 
There  are  two  ways: 
Solar   thermal

Rays  are focused 

Focused  rays  can   heat  water

Water  turns  to  steam  to  make  electricity

Solar voltaic 
The  sunlight   impinges  on   a  solar  voltaic  cell

The  energy  is   directly  conver ted   into   DC  electricity
