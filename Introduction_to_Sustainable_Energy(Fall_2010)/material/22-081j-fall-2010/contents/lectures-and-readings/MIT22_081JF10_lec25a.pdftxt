By 2030 roughly 1.3 billion people will remain un-electrified. With Africa's un-electrified projected to grow 
to 700 million, gains made in other regions will be largely negated.

Powering Nigeria – a little 

150M people 
5 people/HH 
50% without electricity 
…so we need 15M connections 

Capital for T&D @ $1,000/HH is $15B 

Capital for Generation @ 1kWh/HH/day
Capital for Generation @ 1kWh/HH/day 

15M kWh/day + 5M kWh/day (losses)

= 20M kWh/day

Assume 4 hours per day level load…5M kW or 5 GW.


So, buy 10GW nameplate capacity @ $1,000/kw (gas) for $10B.


Total capital is $15B+$10B=$25B. (equal to Federal Budget)

Take Aways


• Africa is a big place – the options are as varied as 
the terrain. 

• Energy and the sustainability of the population are 
inseparable. 

• The industrialization track (mainly urban), and quality 
of life track (mainly rural) must both be pursued. 

• Technical innovation will be crucial to meet scale and 
cost requirements of the market.
