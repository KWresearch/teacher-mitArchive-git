Sustainable Energy: Big Picture

• People want electricity, transport, heat
• Now use:       coal
oil
gas
• Major Challenges: 
– CO2 to atmosphere: climate change
– Run short on oil? Security, price
– Run short on oil? Security, price
– Price: most people in the world can’t 
afford the energy they want

Possible Solutions

• CO2: switch from conventional coal
– Efficiency: lighting, cooling?
– Coal  gas combined cycle
– Non-emitting power sources
– CO2 underground sequestration
– Burn Biomass instead of coal
– Burn Biomass instead of coal
• Oil running out: Efficiency, Alternatives
– Vehicle efficiency, urban planning
– Batteries or natural gas for land transport
– Coal, tar, gas  synfuels with CO2 sequestration
– Biomass  liquid fuels
• Price?
– Can Biomass energy be cheap??

History, overview of biomass

• Largest historical energy source

• Largest current renewable energy source

• Many historical examples of resource depletion
– England, Easter Island deforestation
– Sahel desertification
– Sahel desertification
– Whale oil

• Scalability and land use resources are a challenge

• Possible better ways:
– Waste from agriculture, forestry
– Energy crops / algae on waste land

Solar insolation

• Solar “constant”: 1366 W/m2
– Measured outside the earth’s 
atmosphere
– Varies with seasons

• On planet’s surface effected by 
geometry and filtering.

Earth's surface removed due to copyright restrictions.

• Photosynthetically active 
region (PAR):
~ 400-700 nm

Photosynthesis ~ 1% efficient
Energy stored <3 MW / (km)2 arable land

Biomass: The Source

• Photosynthesis stores ~300 EJ/yr as 
biomass energy
– Human energy use ~400 EJ/yr
– Carbon cycle: plants die, decay to CO2 
– In fertile areas ~ 10-5 EJ/(km)2/yr
• Requires ~250 kg H2O to grow 1 kg biomass
– Earth’s total land surface ~108(km)2
– Earth’s total land surface ~108(km)2
• For large scale biomass energy NEED 
LOTS OF LAND (even much more than 
solar) and WATER
• If you have spare land and fresh water, 
relatively inexpensive to grow and harvest 
(e.g. much less capital than solar!)

What is biomass? Properties

• Solid carbon-based fuel (like coal)
– H:C ~1.5 , O:C ~1
– Significant metals, S, N
– Minor elements come from soil
• Nitrogen fertilizers often required
• Wet: about 50% water before drying
• Wet: about 50% water before drying
– Low energy density ~9 MJ/kg wet
• Diffuse, relatively low energy density: 
expensive to harvest, ship.
• Annual cycle: biomass available only at 
harvest time, may need to be stored.

The main components of biomass are 
carbohydrates & lignin (+proteins, lipids)

Uses of biomass

• Energy uses
– Heat
– Electricity (including co-firing)
– Liquid Fuels for Transportation

• Many important non-energy uses
– Food for humans
– Animal feed (a major and growing use)
– Lumber & other construction materials
– Clothing (cotton, wool, linen, leather)
– Paper, packaging, etc.

Biomass energy use is currently dominated by wood, 
but government regulations driving rapid expansion of 
ethanol and biodiesel production.

Using biomass for energy: options

• Burn it for electricity or heat
– US Paper/Wood industry: 6 GWe
– Coal is usually cheaper for large-scale
– Good option with carbon cap: mix 
biomass with coal.
• Convert to Gas (CH4 or CO/H2)
– Practiced on small-scale using waste
– Coal-to-syngas and natural gas are 
cheaper, but maybe with carbon cap…
• Convert to Liquid Fuels

Syngas is a mixture of CO/H2 used for many 
purposes. Usually made from natural gas, but 
can also be made from biomass.

Syngas → electricity.

• Large-scale electricity generation
– IGCC: Integrated-gasification combined cycle 
(clean coal)
– Easier to capture CO2 and more efficient than 
direct combustion, but more capital intensive
– Proposed integration with Fischer-Tropsch to 
– Proposed integration with Fischer-Tropsch to 
make synfuels.

• Small-scale cogeneration
– combined heat and power
– 5 kW to 5 MW
– waste streams, off-grid operation

Syngas: Diesel and alcohols can be made via 
Fischer-Tropsch process.

• Coal-to-liquids and gas-to-
liquids technology
– Germany; South Africa

• “Ideal” reaction:

(2n+1) H2 + n CO → CnH2n+2 + n H2O

• Many simultaneous 
reactions
– alcohols, alkenes, etc.

• Selectivity

pressures, H2/CO ratio

Bioenergy as Goal or Bioenergy as Byproduct

• Historically, biomass products (food, lumber) have 
been considered more valuable than biomass energy…
• …So existing policies and practices focus on 
agriculture, lumber, & land use.
• Usually waste or surplus biomass used as energy
– Usually more economic to use fossil fuels than biomass for 
energy.
– There is a lot of waste biomass, but often inconvenient to 
– There is a lot of waste biomass, but often inconvenient to 
collect, use.
• If biomass-to-energy were economically competitive 
with fossil fuels, could see rapid large shifts in land 
use (e.g. deforestation, conversion of arable land to 
energy crops) and jumps in food prices…
• …but if it is not economically competitive, will biomass 
ever be used on a large scale for energy?
• Food price shocks and food riots a few years ago have 
raised awareness of the issues…

Using biomass for energy: options

• Burn it for electricity or heat
– US Paper/Wood industry: 6 GWe
– Coal is usually cheaper for large-scale
– Good option with carbon cap: mix biomass 
with coal.
• Convert to Gas (CH or CO/H )
• Convert to Gas (CH4 or CO/H2)
– Practiced on small-scale using waste
– Coal-to-syngas and natural gas are cheaper
• Convert to Liquid Fuels
– Looks to be most profitable on large scale:
not many good competing alternatives to oil!

Biomass is the only major renewable source of 
liquid and gaseous fuels.

Biomass is currently the largest source of 
renewable energy  in the US and the world, 
and the only renewable source capable of 
producing fuels with current technology.

Liquid fuels offer superior energy 
storage and transportability.
