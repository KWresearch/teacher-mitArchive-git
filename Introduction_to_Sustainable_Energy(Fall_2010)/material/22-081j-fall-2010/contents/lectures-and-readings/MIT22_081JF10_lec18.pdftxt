Considerations


Major contributors to large amounts of carbon produced by 
individuals 
Transportation 
If your car gets 25 mpg and you reduce your annual driving from

12,000 miles to 10,000 miles, you will save 1800 pounds of CO2.

p 
12,000 miles to 10,000 miles, ou will save 1800  ounds of CO2.
y
If your new car gets 40 mpg instead of 25, you will reduce carbon 
emissions by 3300 pounds. 
Home appliances, heating, and cooling 
If you live in a cold climate and you super­insulate your walls and 
ceilings, you can save 5.5 tons of CO2 per year.

Develop a Global Strategy


1. 	 How should cities encourage their 
residents to use public transit? 

2. 	 How should the government 
encourage its citizens to purchase 
hybrid vehicles and other 
appliances/electronics that reduce 
appliances/electronics that reduce 
carbon emissions? 

3. 	 How should consumers become more 
educated on home energy

conservation?


4. 	 What are some actions we can take 
today to reduce carbon emissions that 
have personal financial incentives? 

5.	

Can a government impose an 
individual carbon rationing system 
that is fair? If so, how would it work? 

6.	 What incentives should governments 
give to large corporations for their 
energy conservation practices? 

7.	 Discuss other options and strategies 
not presented here.

financial incentives? 
Price increases 
•

Rewards, instead of penalties, for energy 
•	
conser vation (i.e. lower tax bracket) 
Cost association
