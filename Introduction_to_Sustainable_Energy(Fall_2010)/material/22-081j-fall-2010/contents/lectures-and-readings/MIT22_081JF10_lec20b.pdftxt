Introduction to LCA


•  What is LCA? 
–  A system analysis methodology (remember toolbox 4?) 
–  “cradle­to­grave analysis” 

Energy 

Emissions 

Production  of 
Raw  Materials 

Manufacturing 
Process 

Use  of 
Product 

Disposal 

Wastes

Wastes


Components of LCA


•  Inventory 
– Quantification of energy and raw material 
requirements, emissions, effluents, and wastes 
–  i.e. mass and energy balances are integrated over 
each process in system 
•  Impact Assessment 
– Values can be assigned to effects for

quantification 

•  Improvement 
– Systems can then be optimized with respect to 
parameters from impact assessment 

Why is LCA methodology Useful?


•	 Many parameters we are interested in don’t 
occur in just one step of a product’s lifecycle 
– Carbon dioxide emissions from Coal­to­Liquid 
fuels. 
•	 Optimizing one production step doesn’t mean 
system is optimal. 
–	Hydrogen as a transportation fuel 
•	 Lifecycle analysis is intended to be used to 
optimize the aggregate outcomes

Life­Cycle Analysis ­ approach 

•	 Define “cradle­to­grave” alternative  systems 
•	 Set system boundary conditions 
•	 Set time basis (snapshot of industry in time vs. 
one life cycle of representative product) 
•	 Identify impacts of interest to decision­makers 
–  Costs, air pollution, GHG emissions, wastes, 
resource depletion, etc. 
•	 For each portion of the life­cycle, estimate the 
impacts of interest 
•	 Assess overall tradeoffs, considering 
uncertainties 
•	 Identify major sources of adverse impact and 
assess improvements 

Life Cycle Analysis Software 

•  Dedicated Packages 
– GaBi 
– Umberto 
•  DIY (for simple cases) 
– Excel 
– Matlab

•	 Useful simplification

– Most energy 
conversion facilities 
non­fuel resource 
use negligible. 

•	 Major process 
steps 
– Resource

production 
–	transport 
– Fuel/electricity

–	Distribution

–	end­use 

LCA studies for biofuels are

mandated

•	 Text of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007: 
–	 “GENERAL.—The term ‘advanced biofuel’ means renewable 
fuel, other than ethanol derived from corn starch, that has 
lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, as determined by the 
Administrator, after notice and opportunity for comment, that 
are at least 50 percent less than baseline lifecycle greenhouse 
gas emissions.” 
–	 “CELLULOSIC BIOFUEL.—The term ‘cellulosic biofuel’ 
means renewable fuel derived from any cellulose, 
hemicellulose, or lignin that is derived from renewable biomass 
and that has lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, as determined 
by the Administrator, that are at least 60 percent less than 
the baseline lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions.” 
–	 Baseline: average LCA GHG emissions from gasoline or diesel, 
whichever a particular biofuel replaces 
•	 The act calls for 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2022, with 
at least 21 billion gallons of this being “advanced biofuels”. 

Life­Cycle Analysis – biofuels approach


•	 Define “cradle­to­grave” alternative  systems 
–	 Choose alternate fuel options 
•	 Set system boundary conditions 
–  This is where the big fights have been/are going to be

•	 Identify impacts of interest to decision­makers 
–  Costs, air pollution, GHG emissions, land­use 
change, Food Versus Fuel? 
•	 Assess overall tradeoffs, considering 

uncertainties

•	 Identify major sources of adverse impact and

assess improvements


System Boundaries for Biofuels


•	 Where do we draw the boundaries for our 
analysis? Why? 
•	 This turns out to be a MAJOR point of 
contention. 
– The California Low Carbon Fuel Standard

•	 If there is a comprehensive carbon tax – 
won’t double counting then occur? 

The California Low Carbon Fuel

Standard (LCFS)

•  The Governor's Executive Order directs

the Secretary for Environmental 
Protection to coordinate the actions of the 
California Energy Commission, the 
California Air Resources Board (ARB), the 
University of California and other agencies 
to develop the protocols for measuring the 
"life­cycle carbon intensity" of 
transportation fuels… 

California LCFS (Continued)


•	 In the California rule­making a large fight 
revolved around the quantification 
secondary land­use  changes. 
–	Argument for inclusion: 
•  Will include deforestation caused by land use 
change to meet demand for food 
–	Argument for exclusion: 
•  Double counting 
•  Measuring a counterfactual 
•  Not applied to petroleum baseline 

System Boundaries for Biofuels

(Revisited)

•	 Policy is likely to play a major role in defining 
system boundaries 
– The term ‘advanced biofuel’ means renewable 
fuel, other than ethanol derived from corn starch, 
that has lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, as 
determined by the Administrator, after 
notice and opportunity for comment, that are at 
least 50 percent less than baseline lifecycle 
greenhouse gas emissions.” 
•	 Assuming that system boundaries are “non­
overlapping” could there still be double 
counting? 

Identifying the Process Steps


•	 System contains a 
connected web of 
individual processing 
steps each with their 
own: 
–	 Energy balances 
–	 Mass balances 
–	 Cash flows 
–	 Emissions 
–	 Regulations 
–	 … 

•	 How do we determine 
the necessary amount 
of granularity? 
–	 Only major steps?

–	 Every subprocess?

–	 Down to the last valve? 
•	 This is a matter of 
identifying goals of 
analysis (think back 
to SD lecture)

Corn Ethanol


Key  conclusions 
• Corn  grain  ethanol  has  a  slightly  positive  net  energy  on 
average,  but  is  very  dependent  on 
–  Ethanol  production  efficiency 

–  Location  and  practices  in  corn  production 

–  Transportation  distances 

•  Improved  corn  yield,  conversion  and  purification 
technology  can  help,  but most  gains  are  incremental 

• Expansion  of  corn  production will  probably  lead  to

more  energy  intensity

Conclusions ­ Ethanol


•	 Corn grain ethanol: 
–	 Considering economics, energy balance, GHG abatement, 
not a bad idea, but limited by land constraints 
–	 Considerable expansion of corn production negates any 
benefits, so subsidies should be restructured to efficiency 
•	 Lignocellulosic ethanol 
–	 Significantly better environmental performance plus 
more availability, but economic cost is a large barrier 
–	 Multiple technology advancements must be made to 
achieve commercialization, with feedstock logistics 
critical 
•	 Overall 
–  Potential for non­negligible (~20%) replacement of

petroleum, but significant investment is required

Why Ethanol? 

•	 If one is to use synthetic chemistry, one 
can make fuels that are not metabolic 
products: 
– Synthetic Hydrocarbons (Synthetic Natural 
Gas, Fischer­Tröpsch Diesel, MTG Gasoline) 
– Other Alcohols (methanol, propanol,

butanol+)

–	Dimethyl Ether 
–	Hydrogen?

•Land­use changes 
ILLUMINATING THE 
TRADE­OFFS 

Food Versus Fuel


•	 Increasing demand for biofuels may 
incentivize farmers to switch land away from 
food production 
–	Decreasing food supplies 
–	Increasing food prices 
•	 Some argue that this was the case in 2008. 
– Data for making a conclusion either way is

somewhat lacking.

– Innovation in agriculture is far outpacing demand 
growth. 

Land­use Changes


•	 Increasing demand 
for biofuels may 
incentivize farmers to 
put more land into 
production 
–  The rainforests for 

soy/sugar cane

–	 Jatroptha in Indonesia 
•	 How do we quantify 
these secondary 
effects? 
–  Measuring a

counterfactual

The Biofuel Policy Landscape 

•	 Blender­Tax Credits (Volumetric Ethanol 
Excise Tax Credit, VEETC) 
– 45 cents per gallon tax credit for ethanol 
blenders. 
– This year ~9 billion gallons of ethanol were 
used 
– This subsidy creates a perverse incentive to 
produce low energy density fuels (ethanol 
instead of Fischer­Tröpsch Diesel) 

Biofuel Policy Landscape (cont.)


•	 The Energy Independence and Security 
Act (EISA) requirements 
– In 2022 36 billion gallons of biofuel use is 
mandated 
•  Of this, majority must be advanced/cellulosic

–	We are not meeting this target. 
•	 EPA limits the percentage of ethanol 
which can be blended in RFG 
–	Oxygenate requirements 
–	Blending wall 

General Conclusions 

•	 No one fuel constitutes a silver­bullet 
•	 Technology specific subsidies have not 
worked and are likely not to work 
•	 US biofuel policy is very friendly to 
ethanol and will make it hard for other 
fuels to enter the market 
•	 System thinking is necessary in analyzing 
such complex value chains
