•  Uncertainties

THE PRE-PRA ERA

(prior to 1975)

•	 Management of (unquantified at the time) uncertainty was 
always a concern. 
•	 Defense-in-depth and safety margins became embedded in the 
regulations. 
•	 “Defense-in-Depth is an element of the NRC’s safety philosophy 
that employs successive compensatory measures to prevent 
ide 
ide 
accidents or mitigate damage if a malfunction, accident, or 
i  i 
da 
if 
lf 
i 
acc
nts or m t gate mage  a ma unct on, acc
nt, or
naturally caused event occurs at a nuclear facility.” 
[Commission’s White Paper, February, 1999] 
•  Design Basis Accidents are postulated accidents that a nuclear 
facility must be designed and built to withstand without loss to 
the systems, structures, and components necessary to assure 
public health and safety.

TECHNOLOGICAL RISK 
ASSESSMENT 

•  Study the system as an integrated socio-technical system. 

Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) supports Risk Management 
by answering the questions: 

�  What can go wrong? (accident sequences or scenarios) 
go w  ong? ( 
que 
) 
� What can 
nces or scenarios
accident se
r

�  How likely are these scenarios? 

�  What are their consequences?

DEFINITION OF RISK

R i  =  C i  =  (Probability of Event, i) * (Set of Consequences of Event, i)

EMERGENCY SAFETY FUNCTIONS 

Reactor Safety Study, WASH-1400 

11 

REACTOR SAFETY STUDY

(WASH-1400; 1975)


Prior Beliefs: 

1.	 Protect against large LOCA. 

2.	 CDF is low (about once every 100 million years, 10-8 per 
reactor year) . 

3.	 Consequences of accidents would be disastrous. 

Major Findings: 

1.  Dominant contributors: Small LOCAs and Transients. 

2.  CDF higher than earlier believed (best estimate: 5x10-5, once 
every 20,000 years; upper bound: 3x10-4 per reactor year, once 
every 3,333 years). 

3.  Consequences significantly smaller. 

4.  Support systems and operator actions very important.

RISK ASSESSMENT 

REVIEW GROUP


•	

“We are unable to define whether the overall probability  of a 
core melt given in WASH-1400 is high or low, but we are certain 
that the error bands are understated.” 

•	 WASH-1400 is "inscrutable." 

•  "…the fault -tree/event-tree methodology  is sound, and both can 
and should be more widely used by NRC." 

•  "PSA methods should be used to deal with generic safety issues, 
to formulate new regula tory requirements, to assess and 
revalidate existing regula tory requirements, and to evaluate new 
designs." 

14 

COMMISSION ACTIONS 

(Jan. 18, 1979)


•	 “…the Commission has reexamined its views regarding the 
Study in light of the Review Group’s critique.” 

•	 “The Commission withdraws any explicit or implicit past 
endorsement of the Executive Summary.” 

•  “…the Commission does not regard as reliable the Reactor 
Safety Study’s numerical estimate of the overall risk of reactor 
accidents.” 

15 

NPP:  END STATES 

•  Various states of degradation of the reactor core. 
•  Release of radioactivity from the containment. 
•  Individual risk. 
•  Numbers of early and latent deaths. 
•
•  Number of injuries. 
•  Land contamination. 

16 

NPP:  INITIATING EVENTS 

•  Transients 
�  Loss of offsite power 

�  Turbine trip 

�  Others 
•  Loss-of-Coolant Accidents (LOCAs) 
•
�  Small LOCA 

�  Medium LOCA

CUT SET:  A cut set is any set of failures of 
components and actions sufficient to cause system 
failure. 

MINIMAL CUT SET:  A minimal cut set is a set of 
failures necessary to cause system failure. A minimal 
cut set contains only a single cut set.

SUBSIDIARY GOALS 

•  The average core damage frequency (CDF) should be less than 
10-4/ry (once every 10,000 reactor years) 

•  The large early release frequency (LERF) should be less than 
10-5/ry (once every 100,000 reactor years)

UNACCEPTABLE REGION 

Risk cannot be justified 
save in extraordinary 
circumstances 

TOLERABLE REGION 

BROADLY ACCEPTABLE REGION 

Control measures must be 
introduced for risk in this
introduced for risk in this 
region to drive residual risk 
towards the broadly 
acceptable region 

Level of residual risk 
regarded as insignificant -­
further effort to reduce risk 
not likely to be required 

Adapted from "The tolerability of risk from nuclear power stations", Health Safety Executive. 

53 

PRA POLICY STATEMENT 
(1995) 

•  The use of PRA should be increased to the extent supported by 
the state of the art and data and in a manner that complements the 
defense-in-depth philosophy. 

•  PRA should be used to reduce unnecessary conservatisms 
•
PRA should be used to reduce unnecessary conservatisms 
associated with current regulatory requirements.
