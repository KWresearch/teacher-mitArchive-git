INTRODUCTION 

•  Due to Large Fluctuations in Supply and Demand, 
Energy Systems Must be Able to Respond to Changing 
Conditions in Order to Meet Consumer Energy Needs 
Across Time and Space 
•  Examples 
•
�  Oil products:  home heating oil and gasoline 

�  Natural gas 
•  Electricity is the Most Pronounced Example

ANNUAL AND SEASONAL 

DEMAND VARIATIONS


•  Annual 
�  Driven by economic growth 

�  Rough rule of thumb 

�  Developed economies:  electric growth rates 
approximately equal to economic growth rates 
approximately equal to economic growth rates 

�  Developing economies:  electric growth rates 
approximately twice that of economic growth rates 
•  Seasonal Changes Due to 
�  Weather 

�  Changes in usage (e.g., lighting, air conditioning)

USEFUL FACTS REGARDING 
DEMAND VARIATIONS 

•  Demand is an Empirically Determined Probability Distribution

SIMPLE DEMAND

CALCULATION


•	 Problem 
�	 What is the amount of generation capacity needed to supply 
20 GW of peak load? 

�	 If the system’s load factor is .65, what is the average amount 
of demand? 
of demand?
•  Assumptions 
�  3% transmission losses and 6% distribution losses 

�  20% capacity factor (amount of extra capacity needed 
beyond system peak to account for outages - to be discussed 
below) 

10 

SIMPLE DEMAND 
CALCULATION (Con’t) 

•  Solution 
�  Generation Capacity = 1.20 *[20 GW + 20 GW* 0.09] 
= 26.2 GW 

�  Load Factor = Average Demand/Peak Demand 

�  Average Demand = 0.65*[20 GWh] = 13.0 GWh 
Average Demand = 0.65*[20 GWh] = 13.0 GWh

SPATIAL DEMAND

VARIATIONS

•	 Size of Typical Electricity Wholesale Markets 
�	 England and Wales 

�	 Northeast area of North America 

�	 Within in these large areas, there are multiple control areas 
(subregions that dispatch generation units within them) but 
with wholesale transactions among control areas 
ong 
with wholesale transactions am
control areas
� Control areas 
� Independent system operators (ISOs) 
� Regional transmission organizations (RTOs) 
•  Spatial Demand Variations Caused by 
�  Differences in loads 
� Industrial vs. residential 
� Regional weather patterns 
� Time zones 

14 

SUPPLY OPTIONS


•  Multiple Types of Generation Units to Address Demand Variations

�  Baseload (run of river hydro, nuclear, coal, natural gas CCGT) 

�  Intermediate (oil, natural gas CCGT) 

�  Peaking (oil, diesel, natural gas CT, pumped storage) 

�  Non- dispatchable (wind, solar, wave) 
•  Tradeoffs 
• Tradeoffs
�  Capital and fixed costs vs. operating costs, which are primarily 
driven by fuel costs and heat rate 

�  Lower operating costs vs. operational flexibility (e.g., start up 
time, ramp rate) 

�  Who bears these costs influences investment decisions 
•  Storage Options are Expensive (e.g., pumped storage, hydro 
reservoirs) 

15 

TRANSMISSION 
INFRASTRUCTURE 

•  AC Transmission Lines (V ≥ 115 kV > 10,000 km) 
•  DC Transmission Lines 
•
•  Switch Gear, Transformers and Capacitor Banks 
Switch Gear, Transformers and Capacitor Banks 
•  Distribution Lines and Support Hardware

ECONOMIES OF SCALE VS.

DEMAND UNCERTAINTY


•	 Average Costs per MWh Decrease with the Capacity of a 
Generation Unit (Economies of Scale) 
•	  It is Less Expensive to “Overbuild” a System and Let 
Demand “Catch Up” 
•  But, Due to Uncertainty in Demand (Which is Influenced 
• But, Due to Uncertainty in Demand (Which is Influenced 
by Price Feedbacks), Future Demand May Not Materialize 
Quickly Enough to Justify the Additional up Front Capital 
Costs (Option Value) 
•  These Concepts Will be Discussed Later in the Course 

17 

GENERATION AVAILABILITY


•	 Availability - The Probability That a Generation Unit Is 
Not on Forced Outage at Some Future Time (not the 
conventional definition of availability because it excludes 
planned maintenance) 

�	 Availability = MTTF/(MTTF + MTTR) 

MTTF i  the

�  MTTR is the mean time to repair 
�  Expected failure rate = 1/MTTF = λ 

�  Expected repair rate = 1/MTTR = µ

AVAILABILITY 

Conventional Definition: 

The probability that a generation unit will be able to 
function as required at time, t, in the future. 

19 

CATEGORIES OF FAILURES


•	 Independent Failures - The State of a Generator or Component 
Does Not Depend on the States of Other Generators or 
Components 
•	 Dependent Failures 
�	 Component state-dependent 

�  Common-cause failures - the cause of one generator to fail also 
�  Common  cause failures 
the cause of one generator to fail also 
-
-
causes another unit to fail 
� extreme cold weather freezes coal piles 
� earthquakes trip multiple generation units 
� maintenance error results in multiple generation units 
tripping 

�  Safety policies - poor safety performance of one nuclear power 
unit leads to shutting down other nuclear units 

�  Environmental policies

•	 Tradeoff Between the Relative Cost of Transporting Fuel or

�	 Gas-fired unit in Boston (cheaper to transport nat. gas) 

�	 Relative cost of land 

�  Opportunistic siting (as with IPPs)

remote areas

RELIABILITY AND MATCHING

SUPPLY AND DEMAND


•	 Reliability - The Ability of an Electric Power System That 
Results in Electricity Being Delivered to Customers Within 
Accepted Standards and in the Amount Desired. 
•	 The Reliability of the Electric Power System Requires Almost 
Instantaneous Matching of Supply and Demand 
•  If a Mismatch Occurs That Results in a Reliability Problem, a 
•
Large Number of Electric Customers, Not Just the Ones That 
Caused the Mismatch, Have Their Service Interrupted 

�  e.g., Western U.S. Summer of 1996 
•  This Type of Economic Externality Does Not Exist in Other 
Markets (e.g., store running out of newspapers) 

26 

RELIABILITY AND

AVAILABILITY TRENDS


•	 Reliability*:  The Probability of Successful Mission Completion.

•	 Regional Scale Grid System Collapses are Becoming More 
Frequent (e.g., August 14, 2003, northeast U.S and lower Canada; 
midwest, 1998; west, 1996; Italy, 2003; London, 2003) 
•	 Deregulation is Resulting in Much Larger Flow of Power Over 
•
Deregulation is Resulting in Much Larger Flow of Power Over 
Long Distances, as “Merchant” Power Plants Contract to Serve 
Distance (usually industrial loads) 
•  Grid Components and States are Operating Over Much Broader 
Ranges and for Longer Times Than Designed For 
•  Other Power Delivery Aspects (e.g., reactive power) are Excluded 
From Markets, and are Provided More Poorly

�  Minimize cost of serving electric energy demand 
�  Subject to 

� Demand = Supply 

� Transmission constraints 
�  thermal limits:  prevent damage to transmission 
thermal limits:  prevent damage to transmission 
components 
�  stability:  keeping generation units in synchronism 
�  voltage:  maintain voltage within acceptable limits 
�  frequency:  maintain frequency within acceptable 
limits 
�  contingency:  ability to withstand the failure of 
components

LOCATIONAL ELECTRICITY

PRICING (Con’t)


•	 Dispatch Problem Solution: 
�	 Solution method is usually a linear program 

�	 For each time period (e.g., five minutes), a vector of 
generation output for each generator 

�  For each time period, a vector of prices at each node that 
For each time period, a vector of prices at each node that
reflects the marginal cost of serving one more MWh at 
that node for that time period 
•  Nodal Price (t)  = Marginal Fuel Cost 
+ Variable Maintenance Cost 
+ Transmission Constraints 
+ Transmission Losses 

33 

IMPLICATIONS OF NODAL 

PRICING


•	 Prices Could be Negative 
�	 e.g., a nuclear unit that does not want to turn off during 
light load conditions because it would not be able to come 
back on line during higher load periods 
•  Prices May Increase Dramatically if a Constraint is Binding 
• Prices May Increase Dramatically if a Constraint is Binding
�  Cheap generation in the unconstrained area must be back 
down and replaced with higher cost generation 
•  Extremely Volatile Prices Across Space and Time

DISCUSSION OF CALIFORNIA


•	 Electricity Restructuring Was Initiated at a Time of Excess 
Generation Capacity and Motivated to Lower Rates for Retail 
Customers and Encouraged by British Deregulatory Success 

�	 Need date for new generation capacity was believed to be 
distant and beyond the time needed to site and build new 
generation units 

�  Market forces were assumed to be able to address 
Market forces were assumed to be able to address
supply/demand mismatches in the interim 

�  Desire to complete the bargain between utilities to recover 
costs of past investments and politicians to lower electricity 
prices reinforced the above beliefs 
•  Dramatic Load Growth, Attenuated Market Signals Due to 
Political Choices, and Time Lags in Siting In-State Generation 
Has Lead to Supply Shortages 
•  Forced Removal of Generating Assets Has Been Important, too
