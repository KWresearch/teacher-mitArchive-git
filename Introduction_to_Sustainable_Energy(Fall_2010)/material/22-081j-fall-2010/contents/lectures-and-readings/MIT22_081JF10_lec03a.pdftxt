Historic Energy Conversion Sequences


•  Biomass → heat (esp. cooking) 
•  Solar →  heat, dry clothes, dry food 
–  Solar is still main light source, no need for conversion 

–  Solar is source of biomass, wind, hydro, etc. 
•  Biomass → farm animals → horsepower, food 
Later, people also did these conversions: 
•  Coal → heat 
•  Hydro → milling flour, running machinery 
•  Wind → pump water

Heat Transfer

• For heat to be transferred at an 
appreciable rate, a temperature 
difference (Ʃ T) is required.

– Q = U A Ʃ T

– The non-zero Ʃ T guarantees 
irreversibility

– As Ʃ T does to zero, area and cost 
goes to infinity

Humanity’s Main Energy Source:

useful energy via chemical reactions at a rate of ~13 TW 

•	 Energy released by conversion reactions can be converted 
to mechanical energy or electricity 
to mechanical energy or electricity 

•	 Some reactions are used to convert a primary energy 
sources to more useful forms of chemically stored energy 
–	 Solid fossil fuels � Liquid fuels

Chemical Reactions 

Chemical reactions either require or release heat. 

CH4 + 2 O2 

→ CO2 + 2 H2O 

rxn  = -890 kJ/mol 
�H

rxn  < 0. 
Exothermic reaction: one that gives off energy. �H
Endothermic reaction: one that requires energy. �H
rxn  > 0. 

Except in unusual situations (e.g. fuel cells, chemiluminescence) 
essentially all of the ΔHrxn  is released or supplied as heat.

Examples of Energy Conversion Reactions


Fuel combustion 
•  CH4  +  2 O2 = CO2 + 2 H2O –  natural gas 
•  C8H12  + 11 O2  = 8 CO2  + 6 H2O – gasoline 
•  C6H12O6  + 6 O2  = 6 CO2  + 6 H2O – cellulosic biomass 

Hydrogen production 
•  CH4  + H2O = CO + 3H2  – steam reforming of methane 
•  CO + H2O = CO2  + H2  – water gas shift reaction 

Hydrogen fuel cell 
•  H2  + ½ O2  = H2O + electricity + heat 

N.B. These overall reactions occur through multiple steps

Common Conversion Efficiency

Challenges, Part 1


•	 Thermo Limit on Conversion of heat to work: 
–	 Work < Heat (1- Tlow/Thigh) 
–	 Material (boiler, turbine) & emission (NOX) limits Thigh 
– Cooli
–	 Cooling tower (rate of evaporation, LHV) limit on T
tower rate of eva
ng 
( 
ati
por  on, 
LHV limit on T
) 
low 
low 
•	 Difficult to precisely control chemical reactions 
–	 Common energy conversion strategy: just mix a fuel 
with air, and let the reaction run to completion. 
–	 Then extract work from the hot exhaust gases. 
–	 Usually the conversion of chemical energy to heat is 
irreversible: large increase in entropy. 

Sustainable Energy – Fall 2010 – Conversion 

38 

Common Conversion Efficiency

Challenges, Part 2


•  Energy Resources Far From Users 
–	 Real security, global economy issues 
–	 Takes energy and money to move  the resource or electricity  to the users 
•  Convenience, Reliability, Emissions Matter 
–	 Solid Fuels Difficult to handle (so we don’t use coal for ships any more) 
–
–	 Coal only 1/10 the price of oil
Coal only 1/10 the price of oil 
•  Energy Density and Specific Energy Matters 
–	 Lots of land needed to collect diffuse resources like solar, wind, biomass, hydro 
–	 Transport costs and transport energy significant for low-energy-density fuels (e.g. 
natural gas, hydrogen) 
•  Power Density Matters 
–	 Energy conversion equipment is expensive, want to do a lot of conversion with 
small equipment: Large Fluxes required, so Large Free Energy Gradients 
–	 For transportation, need to carry the energy conversion equipment with you! 

Remember, each conversion reduces efficiency 
and costs money.
