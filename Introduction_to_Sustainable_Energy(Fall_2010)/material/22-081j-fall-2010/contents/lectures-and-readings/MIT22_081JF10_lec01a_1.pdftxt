OVERVIEW 

Assessment of current and potential future energy systems, covering 
resources, extraction, conversion, and end-use, with emphasis on 
meeting regional and global energy needs in the 21st  century in a 
sustainable manner.  Different renewable and conventional energy 
technologies will be presented and their attributes described within 
a framework that aids in evaluation and analysis of energy 
technology systems in the context of political, social, economic, and 
environmental goals.  Undergraduate students should enroll in 
Introduction to Sustainable Energy and graduate students should 
enroll in Sustainable Energy.

COURSE REQUIREMENTS 
•  Lecture/Recitation Format 
 Two 2-hour lecture sessions per week; periodic replacement with a
recitation and problem session. Many guest lecturers are featured in the
•  Undergraduate Student Requirements 
course, and therefore the schedule is subject to change. 
 Homework: 
 One problem set per 3-class meeting days on average.  The first five 
problem sets focus on analytical skills; later problem sets are more
comprehensive and integrating. Eight problem sets total, choose 2 of
4 questions per problem set for the first 5 problem sets, answer each
of the questions in the remaining problem sets. 
 Exams: 
 There will be two take-home exams and one final exam. 
 UG Grading: 
 Homework 
 Exam 1 
 Exam 2 
 Final Exam
