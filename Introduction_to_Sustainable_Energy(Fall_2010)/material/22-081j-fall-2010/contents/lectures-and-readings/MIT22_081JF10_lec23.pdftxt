Carbon Emissions Policy


The riven Senate, with the decision today not to close out a modest package 
of energy initiatives focused on oil drilling, is basically saying the following: 
Don’t look for the vital 21st-century energy quest, let alone a reality-based 
approach to global warming, to begin within the borders of the United States.
approach to global warming, to begin within the borders of the United States. 

- Andrew Revkin, New York Times (August 3,  2010)

Who Needs DC!?


QUESTION 

Would a decentralized (regional, state, local) climate and 

energy policy for the United States achieve what we need?


What strengths come with decentralization?


What shortcomings may there be?

They built a house of straw.”

What is Energy Security?


•	 “The reliable supply of energy at an affordable price.” 
(IEA, 2001) 

•	 “Energy security refers to a resilient energy system.” 
(NCIL, 2001) 

•	 “Energy security has two key dimensions, reliability and 
resilience. Reliability means users are able to access the energy 
services they require, when they require them. Resilience is the 
ability of the system to cope with shocks and change.” 
(New Zealand Ministry of Economic Development, 2006)

Current Situation in the United 
States 
• Electricity Generation 
– Coal: exports >> imports 
– Natural gas: ~8% imported 
– Uranium ore: Most from foreign sources (Australia,

Canada) but U.S. has significant assured resources.

• Petroleum 
•
Petroleum 
–  ~62% imported 

•  In U.S., energy security is for most discussion 
purposes equivalent to oil security.

Why Should We Care?


•  “Nine out of ten of the U.S. recessions since World War II were 
preceded by a spike up in oil prices.” (Palgrave, 2005) 

•  1956- Suez Crisis 
–  10.5% drop in world oil production; 
10.5% drop in world oil production;  corresponding 2.5% drop in U.S. 
–
corresponding 2.5% drop in U.S. 
real GDP (Hamilton, 2003)

Providing Energy Security in the U.S.


(1) Rely on market forces 
(2) Foreign relations 
–  Diplomacy 
–  Military force 
(3) Oil reserve 
(4) Improve vehicle efficiency 

Energy Independence through Substitution
Energy Independence through Substitution 
(5) Increase domestic oil production (oil shale, etc.)

(6) Electric vehicles 
(7) Biofuels 
(8) Hydrogen economy 
(9) Coal-to-liquids

Levelized Cost of Electricity


Note 1: LCOE is an inappropriate measure of the cost of wind.  LCOE erroneously values all kWh identically.   Peak 

electricity prices > off peak electricity prices.  Wind production profile is stronger in off-peak.  Thus, LCOE “under-costs”

wind.

Note 2: Wind integration costs are typically 10% of LCOE
