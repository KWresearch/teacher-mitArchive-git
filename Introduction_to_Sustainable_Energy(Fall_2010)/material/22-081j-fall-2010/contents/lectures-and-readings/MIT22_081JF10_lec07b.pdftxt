MIT “FUTURE OF…” STUDIES


•	 MIT faculty have, over the last several 
years, conducted several in‐depth 
multidisciplinary energy studies 
designed to inform future energy 
options, research, technology 
choices, and public policy 
development. 

•	 These studies — grounded in science, 
supported by objective 
economic/policy analysis, 
comprehensive in scope and input — 
underscore MIT's role as an "honest 
broker" on energy issues.

“THE FUTURE OF THE GRID” MOTIVATION 


•	

•	 The US electric grid, the system that links generation to load, is 
perhaps not “broken” at present, but 
It faces a number of new challenges and, because of advances in 
technology, new opportunities 
•	 There is an enormous amount of hype around the “smart grid,” 
much of it supplied by equipment vendors 
•	 We aim to provide an objective analysis of the new challenges 
and opportunities the US grid faces, focusing on two questions: 
–  Can existing institutions and policies be relied upon to meet

the new challenges and seize the emerging opportunities?

–	 If not, what changes are required? 

5 

STUDY BACKGROUND 


•	 Study team recruited, work began in fall of 2009; initial 
focus was on narrowing the project scope. 
•	 Recruited an Advisory Committee; met (on scope) in May 
2010; will meet again in October and early in 2011. 
•	 Have identified & studied key challenges & opportunities, 
but have not yet agreed on recommendations. 
•	 Will finish study, with recommendations, by May 2011. 
•	 Today: some thoughts on the challenges & opportunities 
on which we are working. 
–  Opinions in this talk are mine alone, not the research team’s!

18 

INSTITUTIONAL COMPLEXITY (US GRID) 

•	 Began with municipal regulation of integrated private systems, then state 
regulation; federal role is limited; no comprehensive national policy. 

•	 Generation: investor‐owned firms (84% of generation), plus cooperatives and 
systems owned by city, state, and federal governments 

•	

Transmission/Distribution: 3,200 government owned, cooperative, and 
(state‐regulated) investor‐owned entities (242 investor‐owned, 65% of sales) 

•	 Wholesale market deregulation began in 1990s, halted by the California 
meltdown of 2000‐01: 
–	 Organized (ISO/RTO) wholesale markets serve about 2/3 of load, about 42% of 
generation nationally by investor‐owned firms without retail customers; 
–	 Regulated integrated companies dominate in the southeast; 
–	 Federal hydro generation and transmission are important in the west. 
•	 No two utilities/states/regions /countries are identical, historical evolution 
occurred differently and at different rates

CHALLENGE: RENEWABLE GENERATION 

•	 29 states  & the District of Columbia have “renewable portfolio standards,” 
requiring non‐hydro renewable (NHR) generation. 
•	 A national standard is possible, more state standards are likely, so expect 
requirements for more grid‐scale and distributed NHR generation, mainly 
intermittent wind & solar.

 More grid-scale renewable generation is likely to require more long-
distance transmission. 
 More grid-scale renewable generation is likely to require system 
22  operation changes (due to intermittency and imperfect predictability) 

CHALLENGE: RENEWABLE GENERATION 

•	 Long‐distance transmission for remote grid‐scale renewables 
poses both technical and policy challenges: 
–	 Planning must now account for new goal (“policy lines”) 
–	 Planning will need to reflect optimization under uncertainty 
–	 Planning and allocating costs of transmission across traditional regional 
boundaries is difficult (currently use ad hoc, case‐be‐case processes) 

•	 Distributed renewables (e.g., rooftop solar) pose different

technical and (harder) policy challenges

–	 May need to configure distribution systems for two‐way power flow & to 
maintain worker safety 
–	 Must provide incentives for the necessary investment – even though it 
will lead to lower sales; need sophisticated “uncoupling ”? 

23 

OPPORTUNITY: SENSING / AUTOMATION 
Recent technical advances offer the potential to dramatically increase the

observability and controllability of transmission and distribution systems.

System Monitoring Today ‐> “Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition” (SCADA) systems 

 Functions: system monitoring, state estimation, blackout detection…. 

 Age:

Have been in use for the past 40 years.

Have typically not kept pace with rapid advances in sensor technologies and information

processing techniques.


 Performance: 
Record data every 2‐4 seconds, sufficient for voltage monitoring, but not sufficient for phase 
monitoring. 
Can have 30+ second delay for detecting blackouts. 
Measurements are not synchronized. 

Automatic Generation Control (Not centralized) 

 Primary control methodology today, individual generators do not usually know system state    


24 

THE IMPORTANCE OF MEASURING PHASE


Calculating flows on a transmission line 

Phase has not been used in the past 
The active and reactive power flows on lines 
are determined by three parameters along the 
lines: 
 line impedance 
 voltages amplitudes 
 phases 

Only frequency and voltage are monitored in 
the current system control architecture. 

New tech. could measure and control phase 
Synchrophasor measurement units (PMUs) 
make large scale synchronous phase 
measurement possible. 
Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) 
make phase modification possible.

On-peak (late afternoon) charging could increase peak load,

•  Generation mix 

•  Load forecasting ability 

•  Distribution network

OPPORTUNITY: RESPONSIVE DEMAND 
•	 Traditionally, residential customers have not been responsive to 
system conditions. (Customers do not know when electricity is 
cheap vs. expensive, clean vs. polluting, etc.) 
•  The potential costs of enabling residential customers to be more

responsive have come down significantly (given advances in IT)

COMMUNICATIONS, CYBER-SECURITY, 

AND INFORMATION PRIVACY


•	 Debates about communications architecture – internet plus 
encryption v. telecom networks vs. private networks 
•	 Concern that AMI will tell utility personnel details of 
household activities, especially absences 
•	 New technologies may bring greater vulnerability to errors or 
sabotage that can induce automated responses that 
produce service disruptions or (worst case) large blackouts 

40 

Conclusions 
•  Despite relatively slow expected load growth, the next few

decades will see major changes in the US electric grid.


•	 However, there is a lot of hype right now so do not believe 
everything you hear. 
•	 Despite the hype, the electric grid will face many new challenges 
and opportunities over the next few decades. 
•	 Some of those changes will occur naturally, as grid participants 
pursue their self‐interest under existing policies 
•	 But there seem to be a few areas where increased R&D support or 
changes in regulatory policy could facilitate desirable changes 
•  And we hope to identify those areas in our report next spring!!
