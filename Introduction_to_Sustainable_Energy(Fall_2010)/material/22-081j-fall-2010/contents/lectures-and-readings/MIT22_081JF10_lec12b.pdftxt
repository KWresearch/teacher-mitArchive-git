Natural GHG effect/H2O (almost 60 degrees Fahrenheit) 

Scale of CO2 doubling – degrees Centigrade 

CO2 is a cumulative issue because of residence time 

Scale of degrees Centigrade impact substantial

Measured T rise post-industrial (whatever  the source, but very suggestive!) 

Patterns of regional impact (poles, extreme weather,…) with some simple 
drivers 

Note: 1 ppm CO2 corresponds to about 2 gigatonnes carbon

Some observations 

Unusual case of experts more worried than public! (Socolow, Princeton) 

* numeracy important: “Man would rather commit suicide than do

arithmetic.”  (G.B.Shaw/Gibbons)


* anthropogenic emissions of CO2/GHG are on the scale to materially 
re-eng neer

century scale); natural variation also occurs 


* current understanding and simple arithmetic call for collective 
prudence in policy and behavior: a call for action, not inaction  - indeed, 
onus should be on case for inaction, rather than the other way around!
