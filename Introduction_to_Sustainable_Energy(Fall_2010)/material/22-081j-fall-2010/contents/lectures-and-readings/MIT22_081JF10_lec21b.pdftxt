misconceptions about batteries 

๏  not much has changed: not true! 
๏  no Moore’s Law (transistor count 2x every 2 years): 
 the battery is an electrochemical device 
 2 interfacial reactions, each drawing upon reagents
               transported from contiguous volumes 
 mass and charge transport required 
๏  all microelectronics are silicon-based: 
 device performance improvements come from 
better manufacturing capabilities 
๏  all new batteries are based on entirely new chemistries 
 radical innovation 

different approaches for 
different applications
๏ don’t pay for attributes you don’t need
๏ cell phone needs to be idiot-proof
๏ car needs to be crashworthy
๏ safety is a premium in both applications
๏ how about service temperature?                    
human contact?
๏ stationary batteries: more freedom in choice of 
chemistry but very low price point

storage is the key enabler 
๏  for deployment of renewables: unless their intermittency 
can be addressed they cannot contribute to baseload 
 even if you had 100% conversion efﬁciency in 
     photovoltaics they still wouldn’t make it in much of the
 marketplace 
๏  in grid-level storage we need to think about the problem 
differently when combustion is an option: 
 batteries invented for portable applications are not
 scalable at an acceptable price point 
 stringing together thousands of Li-ion batteries won’t do:
     here the whole is less than the sum of its parts 

storage is the key enabler 

๏ smart grid requires rapid response capability

accelerating the rate of discovery 

๏  there is plenty of room at the top: 
we are not up against any natural laws of nature yet      
 time to start thinking beyond lithium 
๏  the ﬁeld is woefully underfunded by government: 
energy research in total $1.4B (2006) < ⅙ 1979 ﬁgure 
c.f. medical research rose by 4× to $29B 
๏  the private sector research spending is even bleaker: 
US energy industry < 0.25% revenues 
c.f. pharmaceuticals 18%
 semiconductors 16%
 automotive 3% 

accelerating the rate of discovery 

๏  more money   more people                              
 sustained effort   the brightest minds 
๏  new approaches: computational materials science 
 Volta partners with Schrödinger, i.e., bring
 quantum mechanics to battery engineering 
 high-throughput computing screens candidate
           materials before lab testing begins 
๏  conﬁne chemistry to earth-abundant elements 
readily available, i.e., not to those potentially 
subject to cartel pricing 

how to think about inventing in 
this space 
๏  look at the economy of scale of modern 
electrometallurgy: aluminium smelter 
๏  bauxite, cryolite, petroleum coke, capital cost of 
$5000/annual tonne, 14 kWh/kg 
 virgin metal for less than $1.00/kg 
๏  how is this possible? 
 we don’t make aluminium in little beakers 
๏  to make metal by the tonne we have giant cells, 
literally large halls in which liquid metal pools on a 
single cathode spread over the entire ﬂoor
