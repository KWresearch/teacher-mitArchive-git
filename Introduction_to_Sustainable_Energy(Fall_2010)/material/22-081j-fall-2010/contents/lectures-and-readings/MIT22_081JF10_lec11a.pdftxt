Heat Source Temperature not Constant


•	 Heat source may start at TH  but the temperature 
drops as heat is delivered 
•	 Heat is maximized if hot medium exits at TC

•  Multiple steam pressure levels 

•  Multiple reheats 

•  Multiple extractions for feedwater heating 

•  Deaerator for oxygen removal 
•  Best performance at steam pressures > P
•
Best performance at steam pressures > Pc

•  Maximum steam temperature: ~ 600°C 

•  Economizer to recover heat from flue gas 

•  Fuel utilization is key metric for fossil fuel power

Steam Rankine Cycle Summary


•	 Fuel flexible: works well with coal and other dirty 
fuels (closed cycle) 

•	 Workhorse for nuclear and most solar thermal 

•	 Low flow rate: thanks to high heat of vaporization

•
Low flow rate: thanks to high heat of vaporization


•	 Low pumping power 

•	 But… 

–	 Limited by maximum steam temperatures due to 

material of construction constraints


–	 High inertia: good for base load, not for load following 

–	 Requires cooling: a water hog for many power plants

Gas Turbine Advantages


•  Operate at high temperature � Utilize fossil fuel combustion


•  Start, stop, turn-down easily � Load following and peaking


• Compact and easy to operate
•  Compact and easy to operate 

•  Operate at low pressures relative to steam turbines 

•  Internal combustion does not require heat transfer equipment


•  Not as vulnerable to corrosion as steam turbines 

Sustainable Energy – Fall 2010 – Fossil Fuels I 

25 

Gas Turbine Disadvantages


•  Open cycle limits exhaust pressure to ambient pressure 

•  Exhaust temperature well above ambient 

• Efficiency limited by high compression work
•  Efficiency limited by high compression work 

•  Cannot use dirty fuels (particulate & sulfur damage blades)


•  Exhaust temperature well above ambient

Combined Cycle

Most common combined cycle = Brayton + Rankine


Efficiency ≈ 60%
