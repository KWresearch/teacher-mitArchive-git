Why so little progress on 
international climate negotiations?

The State of Affairs
• The Kyoto Framework of binding commitments with option of 
international trading is for all practical purposes dead.
– Proximate cause—US withdrawal
– But Japan, Canada, Russia, Australia while ratifying are not 
fully committed—If US had stayed in?
– Developing country and Annex I/B designations became a 
near impenetrable wall to coverage expansion.
• Overriding issue.
• Overriding issue.
– Negotiating both about how much to do overall, and how to 
share the burden.
– Particularly with trading it is very complex to estimate 
whether a country might gain or lose from a particular 
commitment and it depends on what other’s commitment are 
and whether they live up to them

The State of Affairs II
• The success of international negotiations depend on the 
negotiators ability to implement measures within their own 
countries to achieve agreed reductions 

– Hard for negotiators to negotiate both internationally and with 
domestic actors that need to pass domestic legislation.

• Most successful international agreements ratify or codify what 
• Most successful international agreements ratify or codify what 
countries are already doing.

• Copenhagen finally accepted this fact, and included a list of what 
countries were willing to commit (kind of) to do.

– Nowhere near achieving the 2 degree target.

– Most commitments highly conditional.  E.g. US, 

– A step backward or forward?

State of Affairs III
• Copenhagen finally, more or less, was an admission that the 
Kyoto Framework was not workable.
– Kyoto process was a path to ever more “success” in 
negotiating worthless agreements.
• What could have we have expected from Cancun? 
– We have is the patchwork of Copenhagen commitments—the issue is to 
implement them.
– No reason to expect an ever bigger or broader commitment—a few more 
countries committing.
– “Success” is just making progress in implementing, avoiding backsliding, 
working out details, reaffirming—even if we could do that there is not 
much “headline” in it.
– The collapse of cap and trade legislation in the US sucked any air there 
might have been out of Cancun.
– If US is not living up to commitment its not possible to pressure others that 
are much smaller, poorer, etc. and who’s pressing.
– Can Europe carry the ball alone? Is Europe a success?

Some illustrative results on two key issues in 
negotiations

• Burden-sharing.
– If the whole world participates it’s less costly to 
achieve a given goal.

– But if developed countries must pay the full cost 
– But if developed countries must pay the full cost 
how much is the transfer?

• REDD 
– Are forests as carbon sinks a lever and what are 
the implications of creating incentives for 
reforestation?

What about burden-sharing among regions?

• G8-Global emissions should be 50% below 
current/1990 by 2050
– Suppose Developed cut by 70%»Developing must cut 
only 30%
• International Negotiations under the Framework 
Convention on Climate Change have differentiated 
Convention on Climate Change have differentiated 
responsibilities:
responsibilities:
– Highly simplified…
– Developing countries need positive incentives to reduce 
emissions—i.e. Developed countries need to pay for their 
own emission abatement and abatement in Developing 
Countries

Goal:  Consider a Climate Mitigation Policy that is 
About as Stringent as Possible, keeping CO2 
concentrations below 500 ppm

If we extend CO2 pricing to land does that bring us closer to the 2 degree C 
target?

What is the role of biofuels vs. reforestation for carbon sequestration?

What are the impacts on agricultural prices?

Non-governmental Action?
• Most companies want to look like they are 
environmentally responsible, and many even mean it.

• In a competitive economy, its hard to sell “green” that 
costs more—companies are required to operate in 
shareholders interests.

– Threat of climate legislation makes fossil intensive 
– Threat of climate legislation makes fossil intensive 
investments risky and so in shareholders interests to 
think hard and maybe avoid.

– But even that depends on credible threat of legislation

Summary
It’s not just the cost of the policy it’s the broader implications on 
distribution among countries and among different types of 
households within countries.

• Do you trust that all parties hold to the deal—Russian hot air—
US withdrawal from Kyoto.

• Energy price and food impacts—even if countries are 
compensated will households within the country be compensated.
compensated will households within the country be compensated.

•

It’s not just abatement cost but benefits or costs imposed through 
macroeconomic relationships—reduced demand for fuels 
undermines a value of oil resources in Middle East, Canada, 
Russia, etc.

• Very different perceptions of equity and responsibility
– Developed countries—past is past, lets fix the problem from here on

– Developing countries—you  became rich by using fuels and forests without 
consideration of GHG implications so that is our right too.
