•Initiatives are similar in different cities.

•Variations in detail often mean widely different

•There is much to be learned from 
comparative studies 

Transit Administration and Regulation


Contrasting experiences with bus regulation: 

México 

Santiago 

São Paulo 

Bogotá 

70s and 
before 

Private Operators, 
some regulation 

Public operation, some 
regulated private 
operators 

CMTC, Municipal Bus 
Company operated main 
lines, and subcontrat other 
services 

Private Operators subject to 
control from the Ministry of 
Transportation 

80s 

90s 

Governments 
takes over all 
routes, Ruta-100 
is created 
is created 

Total privatization and 
liberalization 

Increase in the proportion of 
lines operated by CMTC. 

Initial BRT corridors and 
trolleybuses were built 
trolleybuses were built. 
.

In 1987, regulation of urban 
buses is transfered to 
municipalities 

Ruta-100 goes 
bankrupt, 
explosive growth 
of informal transit 

Strong move towards 
government’s regulation 
of private operators, route 
bidding process 

Privatization of Municipal 
Public Bus Company. 
SPTRans, an agency in 
charge of transit planning and 
management, is created 

Municpality allowed three 
fare levels according to level 
of service to encourage fleet 
renewal. Restrictions to the 
import of new buses were 
lifted. 

2000s 

Government trying 
to control informal 
transit 

Route associations 
becoming formal firms, 
international operators 
moving in, integration with 
subway 

Working toward fare 
integration. 

New BRT lines being built. 

Transmilenio is launched. 
Fare integration with other 
private operators.

CONGESTION PRICING ­
DEFINITION 

A charge on vehicle use levied at
A charge on vehicle use levied at 
points of congestion for the purpose of 
reducing the number of vehicles below 
congestion level ....... and collecting 
revenue. 

Types of  Congestion Pricing 

•Area Licensing Zone (ALZ) around Central Business 
District (as in London, formerly Singapore). 

•Large Perimeter Scheme (as in cities of  Norway). 
•Lar e Perimeter Scheme as in cities of Norwa .
g
(
y)

•Area Coverage Scheme (as in Singapore). 

•Street or Highway Lane Based Scheme (as in Houston). 

Road Pricing ­­
A Broader and Different Concept 

Possible by such means as: 

•Gas Taxes 
•Purchase Taxes on Vehicles 
•Purchase Taxes on Vehicles
•Licensing, Highway Use or Other Periodical Charges 
•Parking Taxes 
Not Congestion Pricing because they are 
not based on location and time of  road use. 

Institutional Links for Congestion 
Pricing 

•	 Trip makers who will pay the tariff 
•	 Trip makers who will take other options 
•	 Trip makers who are disadvantaged by the 
initiative 
•	 Trip makers unaffected by the initiative 
• Trip makers unaffected by the initiative
•	 City center retailers and employers 
•	 Transit concessionaries 
•	 Public transit agencies 
•	 Plans for the use of  revenue 
•	 Responsible elected public officials 

Public Acceptability: 
What to Call Congestion Pricing? 

•  Congestion Pricing 
•  Value Pricing 
•  Rationing 
•  Externalities Charges 
•  “Fairness” Management 
•  Road Pricing 

Congestion Pricing Survey

Mexico City, January 2004

Congestion Pricing – objectives 

•	

• 

•	 Method to manage demand, and allocate road space 
efficiently between different modes by charging a fee. 
Improves utilization of  present road capacity to reduce

need for large investments (such as Segundo Piso) 
g 
( 
g 
)

need for lar e investments such as Se undo Piso
Implies that people pay a fee to reflect the “true costs” of 
car use in congested urban areas.  These include: time 
delays due to congestion, pollution, fuel costs, road 
accidents, road maintenance and operation costs 
Increases efficiency of  public transport (buses) 
•	
•	 Raises revenues and can reduce fiscal deficit 

This was the Introduction at the start of  the survey sheet for 
those not familiar with Congestion Pricing.

�  WHAT FUTURE FOR CONGESTION?  DEPENDS MORE ON SPEED

OF MOTORIZATION THAN THE LEVEL OF MOTORIZATION 
�  AVERAGE URBAN SPEEDS ARE LOW 
­ 9 KM/HR IN SEOUL AND SHANGHAI, 
­ 10 KM/HR IN BANGKOK, MANILA AND MEXICO 
­ 17 KM/HR IN KUALA LUMPUR AND SAO PAULO
/ 
­ 17 KM HR IN KUALA LUMPUR AND SAO PAULO
�  AVERAGE COMMUTE TIMES IN MANILA 120 MIN., JAKARTA 82 
MIN.,  BOGOTA 90 MIN., RIO DE JANEIRO 106 MIN. 
�  CHALLENGE: ENABLE AUTOMOBILE USE IN ITS MOST SOCIALLY

EFFECTIVE ROLE 
­ A ROLE FOR CAR SHARING IN DEVELOPING CITIES? 
­ USE OF NEW ELECTRONICS FOR TRAFFIC FACILITATION 
­ LIMITATIONS ON USE OF CARS IN CONGESTION AREAS 
­ CONGESTION PRICING?

ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 70% OF TRIPS IN MOST DEVELOPING CITIES


�	 WEAKENED BY POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS, AND 
CONGESTION. 

�	 UNAUTHORIZED TRANSIT HAS GROWN TO A LARGE PORTION OF 
THE MARKET IN MANY CITIES: 

50% in Dakar and Taipei, 40% in Caracas, 65% in Manila, 11% to 
50% in Dakar and Taipei, 40% in Caracas, 65% in Manila, 11% to
56% in Mexico in 10 years 

�	 CHALLENGES: 

­ CREATE MANAGERIAL STRENGTH AND SOURCES OF 
FINANCING FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT 

­ DESIGN AND ENACT SYSTEM INTEGRATION FOR PUBLIC 
TRANSPORT 

­ ADOPT NEW MODES FOR MORE RAPID TRANSIT SERVICE

�	 EXPLOSIVE DECENTRALIZATION OF URBAN ACTIVITIES 
TOWARD METROPOLITAN PERIPHERIES PERMITS ADJUSTMENT 
TO MORE AFFLUENT LIFESTYLES AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES 

�	 THE PROBLEMS:  SOCIAL FRAGMENTATION, ABSORPTION OF 
ARABLE LAND,  INCREASED CONGESTION, INCREASED TRIP 
LENGTH ­­POLLUTION, GLOBAL WARMING EMISSIONS, FUEL
LENGTH  POLLUTION, GLOBAL WARMING EMISSIONS, FUEL 
­­
CONSUMPTION 

�	 CHALLENGES: 

­ REDUCE EXCESSIVE URBAN DENSITIES, ADJUST TO MODERN 
TECHNOLOGIES WITHOUT CAUSING EXCESSIVE 
DECENTRALIZATION 

­ DEVELOPMENT PLANS AND STANDARDS THAT CREATE 
CLUSTERING OF DEMAND ADAPTIVE TO MORE EFFICIENT 
TRANSPORTATION

�	 POSITION MOBILITY TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY OF THE URBAN 
ECONOMY ­ LOWERING PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION 
COSTS, MOBILIZING LABOR, EXPANDING AVAILABLE LABOR 
MARKET FOR INDUSTRY,  FACILITATING EDUCATION 

�	 TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS HAVE HIGH RATES OF 
RETURN:  WORLD BANK SHOWS 18% TO 25% AVERAGES OVER 
THE LAST 25 YEARS. 
THE LAST 25 YEARS.

�	 FUNDS ARE SHORT BUT HELP IS ARISING THROUGH PRIVATE 
CONCESSIONING AND ROAD SECTOR FUNDS.  WORLD BANK 
LENT $2.5 TRILLION TO TRANSPORT, 60% OF IT FOR ROADS. 
FUNDS FOR MAINTENANCE ARE MORE DIFFICULT THAN FOR 
NEW PROJECTS . . . 

�	

. . . . BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO DEAL WITH CONGESTED LINKS IN 
THE NETWORK WHILE EXPANDING THE NETWORK, AND NOT 
TO COUNT ON IT FOR SOLVING CONGESTION

THE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN BASICALLY POSITIVE 
BUT THERE IS A CONTINUING NEED TO: 

�	 “FORMALIZE” PARTICIPATING CONSORTIA 

�	 ENSURE COMPETITIVE BIDDING 
� ENSURE COMPETITIVE BIDDING

�	 MANAGE ADEQUATE ASSIGNMENT OF RISK 

�	 ASSURE INTEGRATION OF SERVICE, FARE AND TOLLS 

�	 PROVIDE ADEQUATE ENFORCEMENT OF SERVICE 
CONDITIONS 

�	 REDUCE INCUMBENTS' ADVANTAGES 

�	 RETAIN PUBLIC CONTROL OF THE OVERALL NETWORK
