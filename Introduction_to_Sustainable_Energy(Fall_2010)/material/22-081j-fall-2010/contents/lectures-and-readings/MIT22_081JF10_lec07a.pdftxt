•  Transmit  ppower from hyydroelectric pplants 
•  Often long lines, subsidized by governments 
•  James Bay to Montreal: 1,000 km, 11,000 MW 
•  James Bay to Boston: 1,500 km, 2,200 MW 
•  Bulk supply of power to load centers 
•  Cities, large factories 
•  Lines typically short, <100 miles, essentially dedicated
Lines typically short, <100 miles, essentially dedicated 
•  Interconnection between utility networks 
•  Emergencies such as station or line failures
 
••  Share spinning reserves

•  Reduce required capacity margins 



Fundamental Requirements of AC Transmission 
Stability: Generators must remain in synchronism
Stability: Generators must remain in synchronism


• Stability decreases as lines are more heavily

• Static Stability: Slowly increasing power will 
eventually cause generators to pull out of 
synchronization
synchronization 
• Dynamic Stability: System must return to 
stable operation after minor disturbance such 
as step load 
• Transient Stability: System must recover after 
major fault  generator trip  transformer failure

are experiienciing siignifi ificantt redductitions iin lloadd.

markets, ppolitical selection of favored technologgies, 

Generation Mix – Less fuel diversity (more reliance on natural gas) 
plus new “plants” that cannot be dispatched and fail frequently with 
little warning
little warning. 

Transmission – Extremely sophisticated system built in 1950s-70s 
being used for unforeseen purposes.  Operating outside design 
assumptions and limits.  Nationalization of assets have drastically 
reduced incentives for private investment.  Nimby, Banana and Nope. 

Technology – Consumer and commercial power requirements 
Technology  Consumer and commercial power requirements 
trending towards higher quality and reliability, while grid systemic 
trends are opposite. 

Tremendous business and employment opportunities 
 

Sustainable Energy – no opinion. 

Sustainable profits – impossible in free markets. 

Profit and loss are generated by success or failure in adjusting 
the course of production activities to the most urgent demand 
of the consumers. Once this adjustment is achieved, they 
disappear.  - Ludwig von Mises, Profit and Loss
