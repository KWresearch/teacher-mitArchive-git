DISPOSAL OPTIONS 
 
•  Sub-Seabed 
•  Ice Sheets 
•  Space 
•  Deep Bore Holes 
•  Geologic repositories for storing highly radioactive materials 
have been chosen by the National Academy of Science in several 
assessments versus the alternative means of storage or disposal
of highly radioactive materials.

TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE 
 
CRITERIA
 
•  The bases for determining the performance of a geologic
repository are established by regulations 
•  The regulations establish numerical release limits that are 
presumed to be 
1)	
  Self consistent between regulating agencies	
 
	
 
	
  NRC within 5 km of repository	
 
	
 
	
  EPA beyond 5 km	
 
2)	
  Based upon equivalency of different radionuclide risks with 	
 
regard to dose to man	
 
	
 
3)	
  Consistent with other societal risks	
 
	
 
	
  Current basis is indirectly related to demonstrating a total
system performance probability of less than one chance in
10 of causing 1000 excess deaths per 10,000 years

25	
 

TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE OF 
 
A GEOLOGIC REPOSITORY
 
•	  In essence, the performance of a geologic repository system boils down
to a very detailed risk assessment of all of the physical and processes
that could occur that may result in releases of radionuclides to the
environment using predictions extrapolated to many thousands of years
into the future. 
•	  First, Scenario of Likely Events Must be Identified For the Chosen 
Repository Location (Yucca Mountain) 
•	  Natural, High Probability 
  Natural Degradation of Engineered Barriers and Waste Forms 
  Movement of Radionuclides in Ground Water or Air 
•	  Natural, Low Probability 
  Volcanism 
  Earthquakes 
•	  Human Intrusion 
  Drilling 
  Mining

For Each of the Events, Predictive Models Must Be Developed

  Natural Barriers and Repository Inﬂuences	
 
	
  Radionuclide Transport in Ground Water	
 
	
-
	
  Radionuclide Transport as Vapors and Gases	
 
	
-
	
  Water Inﬁltration into Repository

and a Net Separation of Uranium and Plutonium from the Fission
Products:	
 
D product
α = D impurity 
D’s for Uranium and Plutonium are Much Higher Than the 
Fission Products, Thus a Separation (large α) is Made at Greater
Than 99% in One Pass of Solvent Extraction.

REPROCESSING CONTINUED 
 
After Separation, Uranium is Separated from the Plutonium by
Chemically Changing the Aqueous Solution and Repeating the 
Solvent Extraction	
 
Approximately 1% of the Spent Fuel is Plutonium of Which 
 
70% is Fissile (7 g/kg spent fuel)	
 
	
 
ECONOMICS:	
 
~$1300/kg	
 
	
 
Cost of Reprocessing	
 
~$  350/kg	
 
Cost of Fuel Fabrication	
 
	
 
Energy Value of Plutonium	
  ~$  200/kg	
 
	
 
	
 
~$  60/kg	
 
Uranium Credit	
 
Therefore, Marginal to Uneconomic to Reprocess at Current 
 
Facilities, Particularly When Uranium is Very Inexpensive	

 
Fission Products and Actinide Wastes are Sent for Processing 
Into Glass Logs for Permanent Disposal

Historical Perspective of High-Level Waste Glass:	
 
•	
  Natural Analogs	
 
•	
  High Durability (10X better than spent fuel in retaining
radionuclides	
 
•	
  High Waste Loading (up to 30 wt% waste vs. 5% for spent fuel)	

 
•	
  Predictability of Degradation
