NUCLEAR ENERGY 
BASICS AND STATUS

GOALS 

•  To Understand the Situation and Prospects of the Nuclear Power 
Enterprise Within the Overall Energy Context 
�  Domestically 
�  Internationally

NUCLEAR POWER

TECHNOLOGIES

GOALS OF NUCLEAR POWER DISCUSSION:  To Answer the 
Following Questions 
•	 Who used nuclear power today? 
Answer:  Most industrialized countries. 
•	 Who is likely to use nuclear power in the future?

Answer:  East Asian and developing countries, countries wanting energy

supply diversity.

pp y 
y 
su
l diversit .
•  What are the important nuclear power technologies 
�  Today?  Answer:  LWRs – pressurized and boiling water reactors. 
�  Future?  Answer:  Maybe LWRs near term, gas-cooled reactors 
medium term, breeder reactors long term. 
•  How could nuclear power relieve global warming? 
Answer:  Most likely with large-scale, high-temperature breeder reactors. 
•  What are the future prospects for nuclear power? 
Answer:  That depends upon how concerned people are about the 
problems of other energy technologies and what nuclear power can 
produce in addition to electricity.

INTERNATIONAL TRENDS


•	 Deregulation originated in the United Kingdom, went well until 
natural gas prices fell (≈ 2002); British Energy was near 
bankruptcy and depended upon government loans 

•	 Deregulation is also being tried in United States, Canada, Chile, 

Japan, South Korea, Australia, and European Community

Japan, South Korea, Australia, and European Community 

•  Consolidation among nuclear equipment vendors is occurring: 
Areva, Siemens, British Nuclear Fuels Ltd/Toshiba, General 
Electric, Hitachi, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 

•  New reactor manufacturers from S. Korea, Russia, perhaps China 
next, entering international competition 

25 

REGIONAL FACTORS 

EUROPE 
•  Electricité de France is a big exporter and owner 
•  Nuclear power shutdowns have been mandated in Sweden, 
Germany and Belgium; now being revoked or reconsidered 
•  Fifth Finnish nuclear unit (EPR) plant is proceeding 
•
Fifth Finnish nuclear unit (EPR) plant is proceeding


AFRICA

•	 South Africa was developing the pebble bed modular reactor

(PBMR), has shut down the project


26 

REGIONAL FACTORS,

continued


ASIA 
•	 China has 9 units under construction, 41 more planned 
•	 Japan has 11 units planned and 2 units under construction; is in 
recovery from 7 units of TEPCO taken off-line following 2007 
earthquake and are slowly returned to service 
•  South Korea has privatized KEPCO, is planning a new series of 
LWRs, has 6 units under construction and two planned 
•  Taiwan is completing 2 BWRs; nothing is planned beyond them 

27 

EMERGING NUCLEAR

ENERGY COUNTRIES

•	 45 Countries Considering New Nuclear Power Programs; some can be 
classified according to how far their plans have progressed 
�	 Iran: Power reactors under construction 
�	 UAE, Turkey: Contract signed, legal and regulatory infrastructure well-
developed 
�	 Vietnam, Jordan, Italy: Committed plans, legal and regulatory infrastructure 
developing 
Thailand  Indonesia  Egypt  Kazakhstan  Poland  Belarus, Lithuania: Well ­

�  Saudi Arabia, Israel, Nigeria, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Morocco, Kuwait, 
Chile: Developing plans 
�  Namibia, Kenya, Mongolia, Philippines, Singapore, Albania, Serbia, 
Estonia & Latvia, Libya, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Sri Lanka: Discussion as
