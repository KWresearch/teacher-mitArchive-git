Sustainable Energy Take-Home Exam 1


This is a take-home quiz, due Friday 10/29 at 5pm. You may use any class notes, texts, or other 

reliable sources that you wish, but be sure to cite any sources you use. State all assumptions 

made. 

Question 1 (50 Points): 

A 3 MWe wind turbine can be placed at either Site A or B, which have respective probability 

density functions for the wind velocity at the site (assume that the power output of the turbine 

varies as the cube of the velocity) as shown in Fig 1. 

The land for Site A costs $1.0 million and that at Site B costs $2.0 million.  The turbine capital 

cost is $2 million. O&M costs for a turbine is $100,000/yr.  Electricity from a wind turbine can 

be sold to the grid for $60/MWhre.  The turbine lifetime is 20 years.  The discount rate is 0.04 

annually.  Inflation and taxes may be ignored.  Which site offers the expectation of a better 

investment? 

Extra Credit (up to 5 Points): Once the more attractive site is identified what additional factors 

should a potential investor take into account prior to deciding whether to fund the wind 

turbine? 

Question 2 (50 Points): 

An ocean thermal gradient electric generating system is proposed for siting in Hawaii.  This 

system would operate a heat engine driven by heat flow from warm ocean water (cooled from 

27 ⁰C to 25 ⁰C in the heating heat exchanger of the system), and cooled by heat flow to cold 

ocean water (which is heated from 3 ⁰C to 5 ⁰C in the cooling heat exchanger of the system). 

The ocean water used in the different parts of the heat engine is obtained from different 

depths of the surrounding sea.  Using this heat engine electricity can be produced at 90% of the 

corresponding Carnot efficiency of the heat engine. 

a.	

b.	

c.	

d.	

(10 points)  What is the value of the Carnot efficiency of the heat engine?  Explain the 

basis for selecting the parameter values used in calculating this value. 

(15 points)  Should the cold ocean water flow through the engine at a rate of 100 million 

kg/min what is the electric power output of the engine? 

(15 points)  What is the corresponding flow rate of warm ocean water? 

(10 points)  Friction losses arising in pumping seawater through the engine account for 

0.33 of the engine’s irreversibilities.  Over time we can expect such friction losses to 

double, due to befouling in the flow circuits.  What would be the resulting value of the 

heat engine’s efficiency?
