For each of the problems you work out provide a list of sources for any data you used, as well as your 
assumptions. Be sure to mark which course number you are registered for on your solution. You can turn 
in the homework online (via Stellar) or in class. 

Intro to SE Students: Pick any 2 of the 4 problems to solve. 
SE Students: Pick 3 of the 4 problems to solve. 

1.	 “Policy impact on process economics” A 1000 MWe power plant has an “overnight” cost of $2 
billion  (i.e.  the  cost  of  hardware).  In  different  political  jurisdictions  the  treatments  of  the  funds 
invested  in  the  plant  differ. Contrast  the  following  two  cases  in  terms  of  the  total  capital  charge 
values  incurred  during  construction.  In  each  case  assume  that  the  plant  is  built  over  a  10-year 
interval, at  a  constant  annual  spending rate of $200 million/year. A  return  to  the utility company 
of 3.0% of the invested capital is allowed by the government. The annual rate of inflation is 4%. 
Case 1: 
The  national  government  guarantees  the  loans  used  to  finance  the  plant,  resulting  in  a  reduction 
of  the  interest  rate charged by lenders of 2.0%. Also,  the national government permits any funds 
expended  to  go  into  the  electricity  rate  base  immediately.  This  results  in  an  additional  1.0% 
reduction in the interest rate charged by lenders. 
Case 2: 
The plant is financed with commercial loans at a nominal annual interest rate of 12%, and no 
capital investments are allowed into the rate base until the plant enters into operations. To what 
extent does the national guarantee of the construction loans in Case 1 constitute a subsidy? 
Explain why. 

2.	 Do  heat  pumps  make  sense  in  North  Dakota?  In  conventional  air-to-air  heat  pump  systems, 
the atmosphere is used as a source of energy in the winter during heating season and as a sink for 
heat  rejection  in  the  summer  during  air  conditioning  season.  Geothermal  ground  source  heat 
pumps  use  an  underground  reservoir  as  a  thermal  heat  source  and  sink.  These  reservoirs  are 
usually  3  to  10  meters  deep,  below  the  depth  where  seasonal  fluctuations  occur  (i.e.  below  the 
frost  line).  At  these  depths  the  temperature  is  about  15  °C.  A  non-freezing,  non-corrosive  fluid, 
like  an  aqueous  solution  of  potassium  acetate,  is  circulated  through  a  coil  of  pipe  buried  in  the 
ground to transfer thermal energy to and from the ground. 

a. How would you expect a geothermal heat pump system  to perform  in comparison  to an air-to ­
air heat pump system operating under the following conditions in North Dakota? 
(i) Summer day when the outside temperature is 100°F (37.8 °C) 
(ii) Winter day when the outside temperature is –30°F (-34.4 °C) 
People in North Dakota like to keep their homes at a constant 70°F (21.1 °C) year round. 
Comparisons should be made on the ideal basis for a fully reversible system and should be 
expressed in terms of units of heat (or cooling) transferred per unit of electrical work consumed, 
which is called the coefficient of performance (COP). 

b. What factors will limit the performance of practical heat pumps below their ideal limit? 

3.	 The importance of ΔT. You have been tasked by seismic energy to assess the lifetime 
thermodynamic efficiency of an engineered geothermal system they installed one year ago in 
southern California. A geological engineering firm has reported that the time evolution of the 
temperature of the geothermal formation which you are extracting energy from will follow the 
general relationship: 
T(t)=Ae-Bt + C

where T(t = 0 years)= 800K, T(t = 1 years)=790K, and T(t->∞)->300K.

a. Solve for each of the constants A, B, and C and plot temperature versus time for 50 years. 
b. Derive an expression for the maximum theoretical efficiency of a heat engine utilizing 
this heat source versus time. Plot the maximum theoretical efficiency versus time for 10 
years. Assume that there is sufficient ocean water available to maintain a cold 
temperature of 295K for heat rejection. 
c. Now suppose that the company has installed a steam Rankine heat cycle to convert this 
heat source into usable work. Plot the efficiency on the same graph as (b). The pressure 
ratio is 2 and the high pressure is 1 bar (i.e. the cycle runs under vaccum), the isentropic 
pump efficiency is 90%, and the isentropic turbine efficiency is 75% (Hints: For a basis 
assume a mass flow rate of 1kg/s of working fluid. Use the rankine cycle calculator 
provided in class to calculate the efficiency at every year, then plot the series.) 

P(R = −1) = 

4.	 Variable interest rates versus fixed interest rate. Your rich uncle recently 
passed away and you have been left $1million from his estate. You have done some 
research into different investment options and have narrowed your choices down to two. 
The first option is a 10 year investment with a fixed annual interest rate of 5% which 
compounds annually, the second is a 10 year investment which also compounds annually, 
but the interest rate is variable and is given by the formula: 
var iable (T ) = i 
var iable (T  − 1) + R × 1% 
i 
where T is year and R is a random number given by the probability distribution

Take i variable(T=0)=5%. For this problem neglect inflation.

a. On average, should the variable interest investment yield more, less, or the same

as the fixed interest investment? Why?

b. If which investment would you choose, and why? 
c. Use Monte Carlo simulation to calculate what the expected value of the

investment will be after 10 years with the variable interest rate? What is the

standard deviation? The maximum achieved value? The minimum achieved

value?

d. What is the likelihood of losing money on the variable interest investment? What

is the likelihood that you will triple your investment in 10 years?
