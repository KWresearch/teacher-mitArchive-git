***** Homework *****
There are eight problem sets for this course. Undergraduate students should
answer 2 out of 4 questions on each of the first five problem sets, and then
answer all questions on the remaining problem sets. Graduate students should
answer 3 out of 4 questions on each of the first five problem sets. The term
paper takes the place of the other three problem sets for graduate students.

Term Paper
Students enrolled in the graduate course must complete a term paper. The term
paper is to answer a question based upon information available in the
literature. It is not a research paper, demanding original intellectual
contributions. Your paper should answer the question, noting important
uncertainties, areas of unavailable knowledge and including a critique of the
information in the literature. You should not become an advocate for a policy
or position. Please choose a topic that is of interest for a term paper. Do not
pick a topic that you are working on or have worked on as a project already â
we want you to look into something outside of your main expertise.
**** Timeline ****
A term paper prospectus is due in Session #4. In your prospectus, please
provide us with the following information:
   1. What is the question?
   2. Why is the answer important?
   3. What are the important elements and phenomena?
   4. What literature resources are available? List at least four.
We will return your prospectus with feedback during Session #6. If there is
significant interest in a few topics, we may ask people to choose a different
topic. A revised prospectus incorporating these comments will be due in Session
#8.
Once topic selections are finalized, advisors will be assigned to each project
in Session #11. These people should be seen as a valuable resource to guide you
in seeking out sources and understanding methodologies.
You will be required to turn in an outline of your paper during Session #17. We
will comment on it and help you get a good start. Please include an abstract,
an introduction to the problem, the relevant research you have found reported
(with references to the sources at the end of the paper), your assessment of
the data and your conclusions. This will also require you to identify any gaps,
discrepancies, or uncertainties in the information used as a basis for your
conclusions and include your findings. Each paper is expected to review the
state of the art on the topic and do some independent analysis and assessment
that add insight to the topic.
A final draft of the papers will be due Session #20â there will be no
extensions. Papers will be reviewed and returned with feedback in Session #23.
During Finals Week, you will have an opportunity to turn in a more finalized
version of your paper based on the feedback.
**** Guidelines ****
The most important rule for these papers is quality over quantity. Take the
space you need to say what you need to make your argument. Beyond that, some
general formatting guidelines:
    * 20-30 pages, including figures and references
    * 1.5x spacing
    * 12 pt font size
    * 1" margins
