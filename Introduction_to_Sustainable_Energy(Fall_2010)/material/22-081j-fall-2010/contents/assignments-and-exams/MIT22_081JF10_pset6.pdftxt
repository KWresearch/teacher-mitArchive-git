For each of the problems you work out provide a list of sources for any data you used, as well as your 
assumptions. Be sure to mark which course number you are registered for on your solution. You can turn 
in the homework online (via Stellar) or in class. 

Intro to SE Students: Pick any 2 of the 4 problems to solve. 

1.	 It’s a common misconception that non-nuclear sources of energy do not release radiation. 
However, the presence of uranium and other radioactive materials within the Earth’s crust means 
that burning of coal releases some radiation into the biosphere. 
a.	 Find the mass of uranium liberated from the earth’s crust via the production of 1 GWye 
from coal. 
b.	 Find the activity (decay constant multiplied by number of atoms) corresponding to this 
mass of uranium. Recall that natural uranium consists of multiple isotopes. 
c.	 Find a reliable source on how much activity is produced (not necessarily released) during 
production of 1 GWye from nuclear power. 
d.	 In 2008, a spill of coal ash in East Tennessee constituted the largest ever release of 
radiation to the public by the U.S. electric power industry, and yet this event received less 
media attention than minor events at nuclear power stations in the same year. Comment 
briefly on how perceived risk affects public opinion of these technologies. 

2.	 Compare and contrast the regulations pertaining to siting of landfills for household and hazardous 
waste and for spent nuclear fuel. Discuss the differences and similarities between the hazards 
presented by each, particularly as a function of time. 

3.	 Experts on anthropogenic greenhouse gases often say that CO2  is an inventory problem rather 
than a production rate problem. Find a resource on the global rate of carbon fixation. In a few 
pages, discuss to what extent the Obama energy platform discussed in Prof. Moniz’s lecture will 
succeed in reducing CO2  production rate and inventory in the atmosphere. You should support 
your answer numerically. 

4.	 “US  versus  Japan”  American  drivers  are  often  criticized  for  not  being  as  conservative  as 
Japanese drivers.  But let’s take a closer look.  The most popular car in the US is a Japanese car ­
the  Toyota  Camry  - and  it’s  very  likely  that  the  Japanese  drive  as  many  Toyotas  as  we  do,  but 
they  might  be  smaller  cars.  How  would  the  US  compare  to  Japan  if  we  somehow  scaled  the 
amount of driving done in each country according to the size of the country?  Are  the  results that 
you  calculate  different?  Roughly  speaking  Japan  is  the  size  of  California  with  128  million 
people.  You  should  explicitly  state  all  your  assumptions  and  cite  all  sources  of  data.  Please 
include  several  paragraphs  explaining  differences  in  your  calculations,  if  any,  in  the  amount  of 
driving  done  in  each  country.  Also,  please  identify  uncertainties  in  both  your  analysis  and 
conclusions.
