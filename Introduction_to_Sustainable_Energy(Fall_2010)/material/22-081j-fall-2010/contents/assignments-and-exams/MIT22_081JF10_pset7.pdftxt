For each of the problems you work out, provide a list of sources for any data you used, as well as your 
assumptions. Be sure to mark which course number you are registered for on your solution. You can turn 
in the homework online (via Stellar) or in class. 

Intro to SE Students: Pick any 2 of the 4 problems to solve. 

1.	 Home Solar PV Installation: The recent conversations about energy security have included a lot 
of discussion on programs to install PV solar generation in homes. 
a.  Find a reference for the average electrical energy usage of a home in your home state. 
b.  Based on this usage, choose a system for generation of this energy by solar power. 
Calculate the required area of solar panels and estimate the costs for the panels plus 
installation. Keep in mind that capacity factor will depend on location. 
c.  Based on electricity prices in your home state, how long will it take for the system to pay 
for itself in electricity bill savings? 

2.	 Geothermal in the U.S.: Some argue that geothermal energy is a dilute, low-grade energy 
resource that is too small to make a difference. 
a.	 Given that the U.S. consumes about 100 quads annually, estimate the minimum mass of 
hot rock needed to meet annual demand assuming the rock mass is at 200 °C initially. 
b.	 Given that the average geothermal temperature gradient is 20 °C/km for the US, how 
much thermal energy is stored in rock to a depth of 10 km corresponding to depths that 
can be reached using conventional drilling technology? 
c.	 An ambient temperature of 25 °C can be assumed.  The surface area of the U.S. is 
9.37x106  km2.  You can assume that the rock mass under the surface of the US is solid 
granite with a density of 2500 kg/m3  and a heat capacity of 1000 J/kg K. 

3.	 Tradeoffs in geothermal: In dealing with EGS geothermal energy there is always the option to 
drill deeper to reach higher rock temperatures. Higher temperatures would provide some 
thermodynamic advantages as the availability or work producing potential would increase – so 
less geofluid would be needed per unit of electrical energy generated.  However, drilling deeper 
increases the cost of wells.  Discuss the inherent tradeoffs that exist in EGS development and 
prepare a qualitative plot of capital cost on the y-axis versus reservoir temperature on the x-axis 
showing three curves - one for the subsurface system (wells and reservoir), one for the surface 
power plant, and one for the total capital cost.  A lower grade of the EGS resource should be 
used as a basis to define how rock temperature increases with depth where the average 
gradient is about 30 oC/km. 

4.	 New solar generation prospects for Europe: Read the article “Sending African Sunlight to Europe, 
Special Delivery”, from Science Magazine’s August 2010 edition: 
http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/329/5993/782.pdf. 

Imagine you are an advisor to a European government considering investing in this project. In a 
few pages, sum up the risks involved from a financial, technical, and geopolitical standpoint. 
Conclude your commentary with recommendations to your advisee.
