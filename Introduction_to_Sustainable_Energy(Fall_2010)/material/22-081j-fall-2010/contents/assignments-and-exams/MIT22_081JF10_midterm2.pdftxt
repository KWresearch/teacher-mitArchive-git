(50 points)  Consider a steady state nuclear power economy consisting of light water 
reactors, all having a conversion ratio, C, of 0.10.  Each reactor requires being loaded with 
30 tonnes of fresh, 5% enriched in 235U, UO2 fuel per year, with an approximately equal 
mass of depleted (i.e., having a 235U material concentration of 1.0%) fuel being removed 
from the reactor. 
(a)	 10 points  Of what does the fissile material of the removed fuel consist? 
(b) 	 10 points  What is the approximate mass concentration of fission products in the 
removed fuel?  Assume that only 235U has fissioned. 
(c)	 10 points  For 1 kg of fresh fuel loaded into the reactor, approximately how much 
thermal energy will be produced before the resulting fuel is removed from the reactor? 
Again assume that only 235U has fissioned. 
(d) 	 10 points  Why is the assumption from Questions (b) and (c) a bad one? 
(e)	 10 points  It is proposed to change the reactor’s conversion ratio value to 0.50.  If the 
power of the reactor is unchanged, qualitatively what will be the resulting changes in 
the rate of production of 239Pu and timescale that the fuel can be used in the reactor? 
Why?  Assume that all plutonium produced is 239Pu. 
Hint:  You may approximate the production of 239Pu by assuming that each 235U nucleus 
undergoing fission is replaced by C 239Pu nuclei.

(50 points)  In San Francisco, California, state and city tax credits are such that ≤10 kWe of 
solar photovoltaic capacity can be installed in a residential home at no cost to the 
homeowner.  The electricity produced can be sold into the California ISO at a price of 6x 
the cost of producing coal-based electricity. 
What are the costs and benefits of this policy?  (i.e., list the factors that should be taken into 
account in such an evaluation.)  Among those affected by this policy are homeowners, 
taxpayers, solar technology manufacturers, installers and maintenance firms, electricity 
consumers, future Californians, Navadians and Oregonians, consumers of electricity, 
persons exposed to health harm from burning of coal, and persons who could be benefitted 
by other uses of the funds devoted to such installations.  For each such group, indicate the 
costs and benefits of this policy. 

EXTRA CREDIT, 5 POINTS: 
Assuming that all of the costs and benefits of the policy mentioned in Problem 2 could be 
quantified, show how you would use such results to decide whether to continue the policy.
