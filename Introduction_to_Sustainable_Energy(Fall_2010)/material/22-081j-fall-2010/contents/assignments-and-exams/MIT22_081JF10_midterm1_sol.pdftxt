Solutions


Question 1 (50 Points): 

A 3 MWe wind turbine can be placed at either Site A or B, which have respective probability 

density functions for the wind velocity at the site (assume that the power output of the turbine 

varies as the cube of the velocity) as shown in Fig 1. 

The land for Site A costs $1.0 million and that at Site B costs $2.0 million.  The turbine capital 

cost is $2 million. O&M costs for a turbine is $100,000/yr.  Electricity from a wind turbine can 

be sold to the grid for $60/MWhre.  The turbine lifetime is 20 years.  The discount rate is 0.04 

annually.  Inflation and taxes may be ignored.  Which site offers the expectation of a better 

investment? 

Solution: 

We can assess each of these sites by comparing their net present values—the difference 

between the net present values of the expenditures and revenues. 

Since we are to ignore inflation and taxes, the revenues from electricity generation and the costs 

associated with O&M are fairly straightforward to compute. 

The revenue associated with either site can be estimated as the price per MWhre times the 

average power produced by the project. 

If the turbines have their maximum electric power output at v=20 m/s, then the power produced 
by the turbines goes as P=(3 MWe/8000) v3. 

In order to find the average power produced by each site, we need to find an expression for this 

and then perform a change of variables. Since the area under each of the probability curves 

must integrate to one, the slopes of the velocity probability curves must be -0.005 and 0.005, 

respectively. 

For Site A: f(v)=0.1-0.005v 

For Site B: f(v)=0.005v 

The average values of the power outputs for each site can be found using

∫ 
Pf (P)dP .

Basic probability theory says that the incremental area under related distributions must be the 

same, so: 

f(v) dv = f(P) dP 

Using this with our equation for P, we get:

Without values for inflation provided, we’re only able to compare the total un-inflated revenue 

with the initial investment and un-inflated capital costs. 

Revenues for Site A: (0.3MWe)(24 h/day)(365 d/y)(20 y)($60/MWhe)= $3.1536 million 

Revenues for Site B: (1.2 MWe)(24 h/d)(365d/y)(20 y)($60 MWhe)= $12.6144 million 

The expenditures associated with O&M are the same for either site, and can be treated as a 

lump sum paid out once per year. In the absence of inflation, the total expenditure for either site 

is (20 years)($100,000/year)=$2 million 

The present value of the capital cost for each site can be evaluated using:

If we assume that the capital costs are paid off over the 20-year lifetime of the facility, and that 
the money for future payments is not being invested (iR=0), the present value of the capital costs 
is $4.466 million for Site A and $5.955 million for Site B. 

The net present values are then: 

Site A: $3.1536 million - $4.466 million - $2 million = -$3.3124 million 

Site B: $12.6144 million - $5.955 million -$2 million = $4.6594 million 

Site B is clearly the better choice. 

Extra Credit (up to 5 Points): Once the more attractive site is identified what additional factors 

should a potential investor take into account prior to deciding whether to fund the wind 

turbine? 

While the average is useful for making a first estimate of the worth of the investment, the 

investor should also consider the impact of the uncertainty introduced by the wind speed 

distribution. In addition, they should consider how the availability of subsidies, and the 

associated uncertainty, affects their ability to recoup their costs. 

Question 2 (50 Points): 

An ocean thermal gradient electric generating system is proposed for siting in Hawaii.  This 

system would operate a heat engine driven by heat flow from warm ocean water (cooled from 

27 ⁰C to 25 ⁰C in the heating heat exchanger of the system), and cooled by heat flow to cold 

ocean water (which is heated from 3 ⁰C to 5 ⁰C in the cooling heat exchanger of the system). 

The ocean water used in the different parts of the heat engine is obtained from different 

depths of the surrounding sea.  Using this heat engine electricity can be produced at 90% of the 

corresponding Carnot efficiency of the heat engine. 

Solution: 

a.	

(10 points)  What is the value of the Carnot efficiency of the heat engine?  Explain the 

basis for selecting the parameter values used in calculating this value. 

The Carnot efficiency of the heat engine is 1-TC/TH, where Tc  and Th  are the maximum 
temperature of the cold reservoir, and the minimum temperature of the hot reservoir, 

respectively. 

The minimum absolute temperature of the hot reservoir is 298 ⁰C, and the maximum 

absolute temperature of the cold reservoir is 276 ⁰C, making the Carnot efficiency 

1-(276/298)=0.074. 

b.	

(15 points)  Should the cold ocean water flow through the engine at a rate of 100 million 

kg/min what is the electric power output of the engine 

The heat carried away from the system is Qout=Qin-W.


The work done by the system is W=Qin*efficiency.


This means that Qout=W(1/efficiency – 1).


Since the heat transferred to the working fluid is defined by its flow rate, temperature

change, and heat capacity as:


Qout=mcp∆T,


We find W=mcp∆T/(1/efficiency-1).


W=(100 x 106 kg/min)(min/60 s)(4.184 kJ/kg K)(2 ⁰C)/(1/0.074/0.9 -1 )


= 0.995 GWe.


c.	

(15 points)  What is the corresponding flow rate of warm ocean water? 

In order to find the flow rate of the warm ocean water, we need to balance the heat 

rejected to the cold water, the heat rejected by the cold water, and the work done by the 

system. 

Qin=Qout+W=moutcp∆T+0.995 GWe 

Qin=mincp∆T 

min=(moutcp∆T+0.995 GWe)/cp∆T 

=[(100 x 106  kg/min)(min/60 s)(4.184 kJ/kg)(2 ⁰C) +0.995 GWe)]/[(4.184 kJ/kg K)(2 ⁰C)] 

=107.134 million kg/min 

d.  (10 points)  Friction losses arising in pumping seawater through the engine account for 

0.33 of the engine’s irreversibilities.  Over time we can expect such friction losses to 

double, due to befouling in the flow circuits.  What would be the resulting value of the 

heat engine’s efficiency? 

Irreversibility is the difference between the maximum theoretical work which can be 

done by the thermodynamic cycle and the actual work done. 

The Carnot efficiency calculated for this cycle leads us to a maximum theoretical work of 

Wmax=Qin*0.074=mincp∆T*0.074=(107.134 x 106  kg)(min/60s)(4.184 kJ/kg)(2 ⁰C)

*0.074=1.105 GWe.


The irreversibility is then 1.105 GWe-0.995 GWe=0.110 GWe. 

If over time, the 33% of this value representing frictional loss doubles, we add an extra 

33% to the irreversibility, for a total of 0.147 GWe lost work. 

This makes the efficiency of the system (1.105 GWe-0.147 GWe)/Qin  =0.064.
