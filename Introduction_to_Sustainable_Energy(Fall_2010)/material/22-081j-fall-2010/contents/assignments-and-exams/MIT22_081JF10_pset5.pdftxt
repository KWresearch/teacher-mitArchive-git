For each of the problems you work out provide a list of sources for any data you used, as well as your 
assumptions. Be sure to mark which course number you are registered for on your solution. You can turn 
in the homework online (via Stellar) or in class. 

Intro to SE Students: Pick any 2 of the 4 problems to solve. 
SE Students: Pick 3 of the 4 problems to solve. 

1.  Consider two power plants, each generating electric power W& 
e  at 300 MWe  and operating at an 
annual capacity factor CF of 80%. One plant is fueled by bituminous coal and has an overall 
efficiency η of 35%. The other plant is combined­cycle, gas­fired system for which the overall 
efficiency is 55%. Assuming higher heating values (HHV, kJ/kg­fuel) of 28,000 and 54,000 and 
carbon contents (CC, Mt­C/Mt­fuel) of 0.67 and 0.74 for the coal and natural gas, respectively, 
determine the annual fuel requirement and CO2  emissions for each plant. Express your results in 
tonnes (Mt). If coal and natural gas are priced at $80/Mt and $10/MMBtu, what is the annual fuel 
cost FC for each system? If CO2  emissions from the gas­fired system were used as the standard 
for capping power plant emissions, by how much would the standard be exceeded for the coal­
fired plant? Express your result in Mt­CO2. To discourage business­as­usual practices in the 
design and operation of coal­fired plants, what carbon taxes would you recommend for emissions 
exceeding the prescribed standard. Express your result in $ per Mt­C. 
2.	 Consider that breeder reactors are to be built using 233U (obtained from 232Th) and 239Pu,

respectively.

a.	 What is the maximum conversion ratio that could be achieved in principle with each fuel? 
(Assume that the reactor consists of pure fuel and that no neutrons escape from it.) 
b.	 What factors cause real­world conversion ratios to be lower than the values you 
calculated in part a? 
c.	 Explain why “reactor grade” plutonium is not desired for use in a weapon. 
In class we have noted that public participation in nuclear power plant licensing processes has led 
to costly delays, and that such participation is justified by some, partially upon the basis that 
alternative fora for de­facto determination of the effective national energy policies are largely 
unavailable within the U.S. political system. If public participation in licensing were to be 
eliminated, it might be wise to create such fora. Propose two such methods for determination of 
national energy policies and provide a critique contrasting them. (Hint, you might examine how 
other countries do this.) 
4.	 Consider  a  gas­fired  power  plant  for  which  an  air­standard  Brayton  cycle  can  be  assumed. 
Ambient  air  enters  the  compressor  at  T1  = 300 K and  p1  = 100  kPa,  experiences  a  compression 
ratio  of p2 / p1  = 15 ,  and  is  heated  to  a  turbine  inlet  temperature  of  T3  = 1600 K .  The 
compressor and turbine each have an isentropic efficiency of 80%. 

3.	

a.	 Per unit mass of air, determine the work input and output for the compressor and turbine, 
respectively, the heat addition, and the thermal efficiency of the cycle. 
b.	 For  a  power  plant  generating  200  MWe  with  a  turbine  generator  efficiency  of 
η gen  = 0.95 , what is the required air mass flow rate  m& a  in kg/s? 
c.	 Using a lower heating value of 45,000 kJ/kg for natural gas, determine the mass flow rate 
m& f  in kg/s at which gas must be supplied to the combustor. 
If  the  gas  has  a  carbon  content  of  0.74  kg­C/kg­fuel,  what  is  the  corresponding  rate  of 
CO2  production? 

d.	

Suggestion:  Isentropic  exit  conditions  for  the  compressor  and  turbine  can  be  determined  from 
tabulation of the ideal gas properties of air and use of the property  pr (T ) . Specifically, 

pr 2  = 

p2 
p1 

p
r1 

p  = 
r 4 

p4 
p3

r 3 

Alternatively,  if  a  constant  specific  heat  is  assumed,  in  addition  to  the  assumption  of  ideal  gas 
behavior, exit conditions can be determined from the relations
