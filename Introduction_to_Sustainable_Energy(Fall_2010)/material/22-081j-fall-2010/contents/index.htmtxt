***** Course Description *****
This class assesses current and potential future energy systems, covering
resources, extraction, conversion, and end-use technologies, with emphasis on
meeting regional and global energy needs in the 21st century in a sustainable
manner. Instructors and guest lecturers will examine various renewable and
conventional energy production technologies, energy end-use practices and
alternatives, and consumption practices in different countries. Students will
learn a quantitative framework to aid in evaluation and analysis of energy
technology system proposals in the context of engineering, political, social,
economic, and environmental goals. Students taking the graduate version,
Sustainable Energy, complete additional assignments.
