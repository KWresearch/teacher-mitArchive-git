Problem 10.2  
 
The field winding of a homopolar generator is connected in series with the rotor terminals 
through a capacitor C as shown in the equivalent circuit below.  The rotor is turned at constant 
speed ω.  
 

 

 

(a)  For what minimum value of rotor speed is the system self-excited? 
 
(b)  For the self-excited condition of (a) what range of values of C will result in dc self-
excitation or in ac self- excitation? 
 
(c)  What is the frequency for ac self-excitation?

The electromechanical equivalent circuit of a commutator machine is shown above. The field 
and armature windings can be connected in parallel (shunt excitation) or in series (series 
excitation) as shown below:
