Problem 2.1 
The gradient, curl, and divergence operations have simple relationships that will be used 
throughout the subject. 

a.	 One might be tempted to apply the divergence theorem to the surface integral in Stokes’ 
theorem. However, the divergence theorem requires a closed surface while Stokes’ 
theorem is true in general for an open surface. Stokes’ theorem for a closed surface 
requires the contour to shrink to zero giving a zero result for the line integral. Use the 
G 
divergence theorem applied to the closed surface with vector  ∇ × A  to prove that
G 
∇ • (∇ × A) = 0 . 
b.	 Verify (a) by direct computation in cylindrical coordinates. 
c.  Integrate the normal component of the vector  ∇ × ∇f )  over a surface and use Stokes’ 
(

theorem to show that 

(  f ) • dS  = v∫  f d A = v∫ df

dz = f∇ • d A 

Since the equality is true for any surface  dS  conclude that

∇ × ∇ 

. 

d.	 Verify the results of part (c) that  ∇ × ∇(  f ) = 0  by direct computation in spherical 
coordinates.
