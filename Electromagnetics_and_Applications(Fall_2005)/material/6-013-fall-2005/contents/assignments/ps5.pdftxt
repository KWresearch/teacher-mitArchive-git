A glass prism in the shape of an isosceles right triangle has an index of refraction  n . The  
1
surrounding environment has index of refraction  n 2 . Neglect multiple internal reflections within 
the prism. 

a) 	 What is the minimum value of  n1  for no time average power to be transmitted across the 
prism hypotenuse when the prism is in free space  (n 2  = 1)   or in water  (n 2  = 1.33) ? 

b) 	

If the incident light at point (1) has time average power per unit area  S  , what is the 
0
exiting time average power  Se  at point (2) in terms of the refractive index ratio n=n1/n2 
assuming that n1 is above the minimum value for no time average power to be transmitted 
across the prism hypotenuse.  Evaluate S0/Se for the two minimum values of n1 found in 
part (a) for free space or water surrounding the prism.
