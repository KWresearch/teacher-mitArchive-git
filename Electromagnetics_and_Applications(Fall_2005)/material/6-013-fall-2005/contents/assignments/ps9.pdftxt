Problem 9.2 
The figure below shows a diagrammatic cross section of a two-phase, salient-pole machine.  The 
windings in an actual machine are distributed in many slots 

along the periphery of the stator, rather than as shown.  The rotor is made of magnetically soft 
iron which has no permanent magnetism.  The electrical terminal relations are given by

Electrostatic voltmeters are often constructed as shown in the figure above. N pairs of pie-shaped 
plates form the stator and rotor of a variable capacitor (the figure shows six pairs of rotor plates 
and six pairs of stator plates). The rotor plates are attached to a conducting shaft that is free to 
rotate through an angle θ. In the electrostatic voltmeter a pointer is attached to this shaft so that 
the deflection θ is indicated on a calibrated scale (not shown).

a)  Determine 
between the rotor and the stator. The device is constructed so that fringing fields can be 
ignored and the area of the plates is large compared with the cross section of the shaft. In 
addition, it is operated in a region of θ in which the plates overlap but not completely. 

 
b)  Find the torque of electrical origin on the rotor. 

c)  The shaft is attached to a torsional spring with torque-angle relationship
