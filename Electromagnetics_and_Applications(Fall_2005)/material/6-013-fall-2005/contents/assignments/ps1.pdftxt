Problem 1.1 – Coulomb Force Law 
a.  View combined videos 1.3.1 (Coulomb’s Force Law and 1.5.1 (Measurement of Charge) 
at (http://web.mit.edu/6.013_book/www/VideoDemo.html). 
b.  An electroscope measures charge by the angular deflection of two identical conducting 
balls suspended by an essentially weightless insulating string of length l.  Each ball has 
mass M in the gravity field g and when charged can be considered a point charge.

A total charge Q is deposited on the two identical balls of the electroscope when they are 
touching.  The balls then repel each other and the string is at an angle θ from the normal 
which obeys a relation of the form 
tan θ sin 2 θ= const 
What is the constant?

(http://web.mit.edu/6.013_book/www/VideoDemo.html). 

b.	 Use Ampère’s integral law over the contour C, shown above over a radius a equal to the 
average coil radius to approximate +1 due to the N turn toroidal coil carrying a current i. 

c.	 Estimate the coil self-inductance L. 

d.	 Neglecting the coil resistance, if the capacitor C is charged to voltage V, what is the coil 
current I and at what frequency f is it oscillating? 

e.	

If a metal disk of mass M is placed on the coil, when the charged capacitor at voltage V is 
discharged into the coil and if all losses are negligible, what is the maximum initial disk 
velocity v and to what height h will it go? 

f.	 Evaluate the coil self-inductance L of part c, coil current I and frequency f of part d, 
initial disk velocity v and height h in part e for parameters capacitance  C = 25μF , 
voltage V=4000 volts, N=50 turns, average coil radius a=7 cm.

A charge q of mass m with initial velocity  v = v0i x  is injected at x=0 into a region of uniform 
electric field  E E i .  A screen is placed at the position x=L.  At what height h does the charge

Problem 1.4 

a.	 View H/M video 1.4.1, Magnetic Field of a Line Current, at 
(http://web.mit.edu/6.013_book/www/VideoDemo.html) where the magnetic field 
strength is measured by a Hall effect probe. This probe works by the principle that when 
charges flow perpendicular to a magnetic field, the transverse displacement due to the 
Lorentz force can give rise to an electric field. 

Figure 5.6 in Electromagnetic Field Theory: A Problem Solving Approach, by Markus Zahn, 1987. Used with permission.

A magnetic field perpendicular to a current flow deflects the charges transversely giving rise 
to an electric field and the Hall voltage.  The polarity of the voltage is the same as the sign of 
the charge carriers.

the y direction.  For positive charges, as for holes in a p-type semiconductor, the charge 
velocity  v
v i  is in the positive y direction, while for negative charges as typically 
= y y
occur in metals or in n-type semiconductors, the charge velocity vy is negative. In the 
steady state, the charge velocity vy does not vary with time so the net force on the charges 
must be zero. What is the electric field (magnitude and direction) in terms of vy and Bo?
