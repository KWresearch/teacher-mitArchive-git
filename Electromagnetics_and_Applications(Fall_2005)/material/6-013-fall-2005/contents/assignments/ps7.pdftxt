Problem 7.1

An unusual type of distributed system is formed by series capacitors and shunt inductors. 


(a)  What are the governing partial differential equations relating the voltage and current? 
Hint: Review Lecture 10, pp. 2-3 (Section I.C.) 

(b) What is the dispersion relation between ω and k for signals of the form  e  (  t kz  ) ? 
j  ω −

(c)  What are the group  ( d
dk ) and phase velocities  (ω k ) of the waves?  Why are such 
ω
systems called “backward wave”? 

(d)  A voltage V0  cosωt  is applied at z = -l with the z = 0 end short circuited.  What are the 
voltage and current distributions along the line? 

(e)  What are the resonant frequencies of the system?

Problem 7.2 

For the transmission line shown, the length of the line is ¼ wavelength  (λ 4 )  at the driving 
frequency  ω of the voltage source.

(a) 	 Find the values of lumped reactive admittance Y = jB and non-zero source resistance Rs 
that maximizes the power delivered by the source.  (Hint: Do not use the Smith chart.) 
If the lumped reactive admittance  Y=jB is made from a short circuited transmission line 
of length  l  and characteristic impedance Z 0  = 50Ω , what is  l  in terms of wavelength λ , 
i.e.,  l = aλ , what is  a ? 

(b) 	

(c) 	 What is the time-average power dissipated in the load? 

(d) 	 The driving frequency of the voltage source is now doubled. What is the transmission 
line length in terms of wavelengths λ at the frequency  2ω ? Repeat (a) to (c).

Problem 7.3 

(a)  Find the time-average power delivered by the source for the transmission line system 
shown below when the switch is open or closed.  (Hint: Do not use the Smith chart.)

RL?

Problem 7.4 

A 100-ohm TEM transmission line operating at frequency f is terminated with a load consisting of a 
100-ohm resistor in series with an inductor having a reactance of 100j, as illustrated. Additional details 
and values are shown in the figures. 
�L

a) In terms of the complex reflection coefficient �L  of the load, 
what fraction A of the power incident upon the load is 
reflected? 
b) For this load what is the numerical value of the complex 
reflection coefficient �L  = a + jb? 
c) At what fraction of a wavelength q = D/Γ (and in terms of �, 
see figure), is the distance D from the load of the first point 
where Z(z) is purely real?* 

d) To match this load a quarter-wave transformer is inserted at 
the first point where Z(z) is purely real. In terms of K, what 
should be the characteristic impedance ZT  of the quarter-
wave transformer (see figure)? 
e) What is K?
