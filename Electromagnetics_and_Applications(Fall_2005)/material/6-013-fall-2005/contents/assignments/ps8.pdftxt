Quiz 2 will be on Thursday, November 17 at 10-11 a.m. It will cover material through P. S. #8,
with a focus on sinusoidal steady state and transient waves on transmission lines; parallel plate,
rectangular, and dielectric waveguides. Quiz 2 Formula Sheets (as attached to this problem set)
will be provided.
