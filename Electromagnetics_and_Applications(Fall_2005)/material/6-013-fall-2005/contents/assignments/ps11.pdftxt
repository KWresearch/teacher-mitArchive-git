Problem 11.1 
A popular 1-MHz AM radio station in the middle of Kansas has a single transmitting antenna on a flat 
prairie that radiates 100kW isotropically (equally in all directions) over the upper  2π steradians (i.e., this 
rR ) of this 
station has no underground audience.)  The matched input impedance (the radiation resistance

Problem 11.5 
 
Sketch the far field radiation patterns in the x-y plane for each of the following short dipole antenna 
arrays.  The identical dipoles are directed in either the +z 
 or -z 
 directions, as indicated, and the 
π so that its complex 
1±
currents have equal amplitudes of 
.  In part (b) one current has a phase of 
2
amplitude is j.  In each case find the angles φ corresponding to nulls ( nφ ) and peaks (
pφ ).  If the peaks 
are unequal, also evaluate their relative values.

Problem 11.6 
 
Using the format of Problem 11.5 design two-dipole arrays that could produce the far field antenna gain 
patterns illustrated below.  The two dipoles have the same current amplitude but may differ in phase.  
Find the spacing a between the two dipoles and their relative phase that results in the radiation patterns 
shown in parts (a) - (c).
