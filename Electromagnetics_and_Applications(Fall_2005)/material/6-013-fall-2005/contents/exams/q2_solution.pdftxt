Problem  1


A transmission line system incorporates two transmission lines with  characteristic impedances of  Z01  = 100 Ω 
and  Z02  = 50  Ω  as  illustrated  above.  A  voltage  source  is  applied  at  the  left  end,  v(t) = 100 cos(π ×  108 t).  At 
this  frequency,  line  1  has  length  of  λ1/2  = 1 meter and line 2 has length  of  λ2/4  = 0.4  meter,  where  λ1  and 
λ2  are  the  wavelengths  along  each  respective  transmission  line.  The  two  transmission  lines  are  connected  by 
a  series  reactance  jXs ,  and  the  end  of  line  2  is  loaded  by  impedance  ZL  = 50(1 + j ) Ω.  The  voltage  source 
is  connected  to  line  1  through  a  source  resistance  Rs  = 50 Ω. 

A 

Question:  What  are  the  speeds  c1  and  c2  of  electromagnetic  waves  on  each  line? 

Solution:  Using  the  appropriate  values  of  f  =  50  MHz,  λ1  =  2  m,  and  λ2  = 1.6  m  together  with  the 
expression  f λ  =  c,  we  ﬁnd  that 

c1  = 5 ×  107 (2) = 108  m/s,  and 
c2  = 5 ×  107 (1.6)  = 8 ×  107  m/s. 

B 

Question:  It  is  desired  that  Xs  be  chosen  so  that  the  source  current  i(t) =  I0 cos(π  ×  108 t)  is  in 
phase  with  the  voltage  source.  What  is  Xs?

Problem  2 

A parallel plate  waveguide is to be designed  so that  only  TEM  modes  can propagate in the frequency  range 
0  < f  <  2 GHz.  The dielectric between the plates has a  relative dielectric constant  of  εr  = 9  and  a  magnetic 
permeability  of  free  space  µ0 . 

A 

Question:  What  is  the  maximum  allowed  spacing  dmax  between  the  parallel  plate  waveguide 
plates? 

Solution: 

ωco,n  = 

nπc 
d 

= 2πfco,n  =⇒  fco,n  =

2d 

with  c  = 108  m/s 

The  lowest  cut-oﬀ  frequency  occurs  when  n  = 1,  therefore 

fco,1  =

m.

Hence  d <  2.5  cm. 

B 

Question:  If  the  plate  spacing  is  2.1  cm,  and  f  = 10  GHz,  what  TEn  and  TMn  modes  will 
propagate?

Quiz  l:  2005 

Solution: 

6.013,  Fall  2005 

fco,n  = 

nc 
2d 

<  10  GHz  =⇒  n  < 

2d(1010 ) 
c 

= 

2(0.021)1010 
108 

=⇒  n  <  4.2 

It  follows  then  that  we  have  the  propagating  modes:  TE1 ,  TE2 ,  TE3 ,  TE4 ;  and  TM1 ,  TM2 ,  TM3 ,  TM4 . 

Problem  3 

A  transmission  line  of  length  l,  characteristic impedance  Z0  = 100 Ω,  and  one-way  time  of  ﬂight  T  =  l/c  is 
connected  at  z  =  0  to  a  100  volt  DC  battery  through  a  series  source  resistance  Rs  =  100  Ω  and  a  switch. 
The  z  =  l  end  is  loaded  by  a  300  Ω  resistor. 

A 

Question:  The switch at the z  = 0  end has been closed  for a very  long time so that the  system  is 
in  the  DC  steady  state.  What  are  the  positive  and  negative  traveling wave  voltage  amplitudes 
V+ (z  −  ct)  and  V − (z  +  ct)? 

Solution: 

v(z , t) =  V+  +  V −  = 75 Volts

Z0  i(z , t) =  V+  −  V −  = 25 Volts


Solving  for  V+  and  V −  yields 

V+  = 50 Volts,

V −  = 25 Volts.


B 

Question:  With  the system  in the DC steady state,  the switch  is suddenly opened at time  t  = 0.
