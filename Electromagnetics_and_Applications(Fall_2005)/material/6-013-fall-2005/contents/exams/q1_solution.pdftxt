Problem 1 
a)  Apply Integral form of Ampere’s Law: 
2π  r 
2J r0
2πrHφ = ∫ ∫ J z (r rdrd φ→ H = 
)
3R1 
φ= 0 r = 0 
b)  The total current going up the inside conductor must return going down in the 
outside conductor: 
R1 
2π∫r = 0 
J r rdr = 2πR2  K  → K  = −

b) The electric field is the negative gradient of the potential.  Problem is best done 
in cylindrical coordinates:

c)  Use the boundary condition on the normal D field at the upper perfect conductor: 
εV0 
σsf   = iφi[ε E(φ  α  ) −ε  φ  α  )] =
E(  =
