DUE  THURSDAY  OCTOBER  30 

(1)  Show  that  if  X  is  a  variety,  then  the  intersection  of  any  two  aﬃne  opens  in  X  is  again 
aﬃne.  Give  an  example  to  show  that  this  is  false  for  a  general  pre–variety. 
(2)  Let  X  ⊂  Pn  be  a  pro jective  variety  with  homogeneous  ideal  I (X )  ⊂  k [X0 , . . . , Xn ].  Let 
X ∗  ⊂ An+1  denote  the  aﬃne  variety  deﬁned  by  I (X ).  Show  that  the  dimension  of X ∗  is  one 
more  than  the  dimension  of X . 
(3)  Let X  be  a  variety  of  dimension  n.  Show  that  any  sequence  of  irreducible  closed  subsets 
∅ � Z0  � Z2  � · · · 
� Zr  = X
can  be  completed  to  a  sequence 
∅ � Z0

of  length  n.  In  other  words,  such  that  for  each  i  ∈  [1, r]  there  exists  a  j  ∈  [1, n]  such  that

(4)  Let X  be  a  variety  of  dimension  1,  and  suppose  π  : X  → Y  is  a  non–constant morphism 
to  a  variety  Y .  Show  that  the  ﬁber  of  π  are  ﬁnite.

An  be  the  blow­up  of  An  at  the  point  (0, . . . , 0)  discussed  in  class.  Show 
(5)  Let  π  :  X 
that X  is  not  an  aﬃne  variety. 
(6)  Let  Z  ⊂  A2  be  the  algebraic  set  deﬁned  by  xy  =  0.  Let  X  ⊂  A2  × P1  be  the  blow–up 
→ 
of  A2  at  (0, 0).  Describe  π−1 (Z ),  where  π  : X 
A2  is  the  blow–up  map.  Also  describe  the 
closure  in X  of  the  set  π−1 (Z − { (0, 0)} ). 
(7)  (An  example  of  why  we  need  schemes).  Let  C  be  a  category  and 
p1  : X  → Z,  p2  : Y
Z→ 
two morphisms  in  C . A  ﬁber  product  of X  and  Y  over  Z  is  a  commutative  diagram

which  is  the  universal  such  commutative  diagram.  In  other  words,  given  any  other  ob ject 
X  and  ρ2  : F  → Y  such  that  p1  ◦ ρ1  = p2  ◦ ρ2 ,  there  exists  a 
F  ∈ C  and morphisms  ρ1  : F

unique morphism  λ  : F  → W  such  that  ρi  = πi  ◦ λ. 
Show  that  ﬁber  products  do  not  exist  in  the  category  of  aﬃne  varieties.  Hint:  try  to 
construct  the  ﬁber  product  using  the  method  we  used  to  construct  products  and  see  what 
goes  wrong.
