DUE  TUESDAY  DECEMBER  2 

To  do  so,  let 

(1)  Find  the  singular  points  of  the  following  curves  in  A2 
(i)  V (x2  − x − y 4 ),

(ii)  V (x2y + xy − x − y 4 ).

(2)  Show  that  if X  is  a  variety,  then  the  set  of  smooth  points  of X  is  an  open  set. 
(3)  Let  C  be  a  complete  smooth  curve.  Show  that  any  non–constant  f  ∈  k(X )  deﬁnes  a 
surjection  πf  : C → P1  such  that  for  any  point  p ∈ P1  the  inverse  image  π−1 (f )  is  ﬁnite.

(4) Let C  be a complete curve (not necessarily smooth).  Let C  be the complete smooth curve 
C .→ 
associated to the  function ﬁeld kC .  Show that there  is a natural surjective morphism C
(5)  The  purpose  of  this  exercise  is  to  classify  all  automorphisms  of  P1 .  Let  P GL1  denote 
the  quotient  of  GL2 (k)  (2 × 2  invertible  matrices  with  entries  in  k)  by  the  normal  subgroup 
k∗  ⊂  GL2 (k)  consisting  of  the  diagonal  matrices.  Your  task  in  this  exercise  is  to  show  that 
� 
� 
the  group  of  automorphisms  of  P1  is  equal  to  P GL1 . 
∈ GL2 (k)  be  a matrix  and  deﬁne  a map

c 
d 
[x  : y ]  �→  [ax + by , cx + dy ]. 
P1  −→ P1 , 
Show  that  this  is  a well–deﬁned automorphism.  Then  show  that  the  induced map GL2 (k) →
Aut(P1 ) induces an isomorphism of groups P GL1  � Aut(P1 ).  Hint:  classify the k–automorphisms 
of  k(P1 ) � k(t). 
(6)  Let  X  be  an  aﬃne  variety,  and  let  Op(X )  be  the  collection  of  open  subsets  of  X  viewed 
as  a  category  as  in  class.  Let  SOp(X )  ⊂  Op(X )  be  the  subcategory  of  special  opens.  In 
other  words,  the  ob jects  of  SOp(X )  are  open  sets  D(f )  for  f  ∈  Γ(X, O X )  and  a  morphism 
D(f )  →  D(g)  is  just  an  inclusion.  Any  sheaf  F  :  Op(X )  →  (Set)  deﬁnes  a  functor  F  : 
¯
SOp(X ) →  (Set)  simply  by  restricting  the  functor.  Prove  the  converse.  That  is,  let  F  be  a 
¯
functor 
¯F  : SOp(X ) −→ (Set) 
� 
� 
such  that  if D(f ) = ∪ iD(fi )  the  sequence 
F¯ (D(f )) → 
F¯ (D(fi )) � 
¯
F (D(fifj )) 
i 
i,j 
is  exact.  Then  show  that  there  exists  a  unique  sheaf  F  on X  whose  restriction  to  SOp(X )  is 
¯F . 
(7)  Let X  be  a  variety.  A  sheaf  of O X –modules  L  is  called  an  invertible  sheaf  if  there  exists 
an  open  covering X  = ∪ Ui  such  that L  restricted  to  each Ui  is  isomorphic  to O X  viewed  as  a

module  over  itself.  If L  and M  are  two  invertible  sheaves,  let L ⊗ M be  the  sheaf  associated 
to the presheaf which to any open U  associates the tensor product L(U ) ⊗OX (U ) M(U ).  Show 
that L ⊗ M  is again an  invertible  sheaf,  and  that  the operation  (L, M)  �→ L ⊗ M makes  the 
set  of  isomorphism  classes  of  invertible  sheaves  into  an  abelian  group.
