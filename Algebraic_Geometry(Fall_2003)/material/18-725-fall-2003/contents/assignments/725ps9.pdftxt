DUE  THURSDAY  NOVEMBER  20 

(1)  Let  f  :  X  →  Y  be  a  morphism  of  varieties  with  X  complete.  Show  that  there  exists  a 
→
surjective birational morphism π  : X �  X  from a pro jective variety X �  so that the composite 
◦ 
f �  := f π  factors  as 
−−−→ 
X �  −−−→ 
Y  × Pr
j 
p1 
Y
for  some  r ,  where  j  identiﬁes X �  with  a  closed  set  of  Y  × Pr . 
(2)  Let  f  :  X  →  Y  be  a  morphism  of  varieties  with  X  complete.  Show  that  f (X )  ⊂  Y  is 
closed  and  that  the  variety  f (X )  is  complete. 
(3) Assume the fact that any closed analytic sub–manifold X ⊂ Pn  is induced by a pro jective 
variety X  ⊂ Pn  (this  fact  is  diﬃcult  and  can  be  found  for  example  in  Serre’s  famous  GAGA 
an 
paper  ”G´eom´etrie  alg´ebrique  et  g´eom´etrie  analytique”,  Ann.  Inst.  Fourier  6  (1956)).  Then 
→
show  that  if X  and  Y  are  pro jective  varieties,  then  any map  of  analytic  spaces Xan 
Yan  is
Y .→ 
induced  by  a map  of  algebraic  varieties X
(4)  Let  Pn  ⊂ Pn+1  be  a  hyperplane  and  let  P  be  a  point  not  in  Pn . 
(i)  For  any  point  Q ∈ Pn+1  − P ,  show  that  the  line  through  P  and  Q  meets  Pn  in  exactly 
one  point. 
(ii)  Deﬁne  a  set  map  π  : Pn+1  − P 
→
Pn  by  sending  Q  to  the  unique  point  of  intersection 
of  the  line  through  P  and Q  and  Pn .  Show  that  π  is  a morphism. 
(5)  Let  F  be  the  functor  on  the  category  of  varieties  which  to  any  X  associates  the  set 
SLn (Γ(X, O X )).  That  is,  n  by  n  matrices  with  entries  in  the  ring  Γ(X, O X )  and  determi­
nant  one.  Show  that  F  is  representable  by  some  variety  Y .  Then  explain  why  there  is  a 
distinguished  point  e ∈ Y  and  a morphism 
m  : Y  × Y  − → 
Y
making  Y  a  group  variety  (problem  set  3).  Hint:  if  you  understand  Yoneda’s  lemma  this  is 
a  very  short  exercise.

Aside  for  following problems:  Suppose V  ⊂ Pn  is a pro jective variety with homogeneous 
coordinate  ring 
Rd . 
d≥0 
It  is known  that  there  is a polynomial P (t),  called  the Hilbert polynomial of V ,  such  that  for 
some  integer  d0  suﬃciently  big  the  dimension  of  Rd  is  equal  to  P (d)  for  all  d ≥  d0 .  It  turns 
out  that  the  dimension  of  V  is  equal  to  the  degree  of  P (t).  The  degree  of  V  is  deﬁned  to  be 
(dimV )!  times  the  leading  coeﬃcient  of  f (t). 
(6)  Calculate  the  Hilbert  polynomial  of  V  = Pn .  Verify  that  dimV  = n  and  that  degV  = 1.

(7)  Suppose  V  ⊂ Pn  is  equal  to  V (f )  for  some  f  ∈ k [X0 , . . . , Xn ],  where  f  is  irreducible  and 
homogeneous of degree e.  Calculate the Hilbert polynomial of V  and verify that dimV  = n− 1 
and  degV  = e.
