18.725:  EXERCISE  SET  2 

DUE  TUESDAY  SEPTEMBER  23 

(1) Let  Σ  =   k − {0}.  Show  that   Σ   is  naturally  an  aﬃne  algebraic  set,  and  that  the  natural 
map Σ  �→ k  is  a  morphism. 

(2)  Let   f  :  Σ1  −→ Σ2  be  a  morphism  of aﬃne  algebraic  sets,  and say  p ∈ Σ2  is  a  point. Show 
that  f −1 (p) has  a  natural structure  of an   aﬃne   algebraic  set so  that  the  inclusion  f −1 (p) �→ Σ1 
is  a  morphism. 

(3)  Show  that  Σ  =  {(x, y , z )  ∈ k3 |x =  y3  and  y2  =  z 3} is  an  irreducible  algebraic  subset  of 
2
k3  and  ﬁnd  I (Σ).

:  A1  →  V (y 2  − x  )  ⊂  A2  be  the  morphism  given  by  f (t)  = (t2 , t3 ).  
(4)   Let   f 
isomorphism?  Prove  or  disprove. 
(5)  Show  that   a  basis  for   the  Zariski  topology  on  kn  is  given  by the  sets  D(f ) :=  kn  − V (f ), 
for  f  ∈  k [X1 , . . . , Xn ].  Deduce  that  for  any  algebraic   set  Σ  ⊂  kn ,  a  basis  for  the  Zariski 
topology  on  Σ  is  given   by  the  sets  Σ  − V (f ) for  f  ∈ Γ(Σ).  We  also  denote   these  subsets  by  
D(f ). 
(6) Let   Σ1  ⊂ P2  and  Σ2  =  P1  be  as  in  the  example   on  page  22,  and  let  f  :  Σ1  →  Σ2  be  the 
map  deﬁned  there.  Let  Ui  ⊂  P2  be  the   standard  covering  (i  = 0, 1, 2)  of  P2 ,  and  Vj  ⊂  P1 
(j  = 0, 1)   the  standard  covering  of  P1  .  Show  that  f  induces  morphisms  of  aﬃne  algebraic 
sets 

Is  f  an  

Σ1  ∩ U0  → V1 ,  Σ1  ∩ U2  → V0 . 

What  about  Σ1  ∩ U1? 
(7)   Show  that   as  a  topological  space  U  =  Pn  − {(0 :  X1  :  · · ·  :  Xn)} is  homeomorphic  to   k
with  the  Zariski  topology.  Here  the   topology  on  U  is  that  induced  by  the   Zariski  topology 
on  Pn  .

(8)  Is  the   Zariski  topology  on  an   aﬃne  algebraic  set  Σ  ⊂  kn  Hausdorﬀ ?  What  about  Kol(cid:173)
mogoroﬀ  (i.e.  given   any  two  distinct  points  there  exists  an  open   containing   one   but  not  the 
other)?  Prove  or   give  counterexamples. 

(9)   Show  that   any  open  set  V  of   an  aﬃne  algebraic   set  Σ  is   quasi–compact  (i.e.  every   open 
cover   admits  a  ﬁnite  subcover). 

(10)   Is  the  image  of   a  morphism  f  :  Σ1  → Σ2  between  algebraic   sets  again  an  algebraic  set? 
Prove  or  disprove. 

Correction: In problem 6, the reference should be to the example on the bottom of page 15 (in the LNM
 1358 version). Also, in the displayed equation V0 and V1 should beinterchanged.
