(1)  Let  X  be  an  aﬃne  variety,  and  suppose  Z  ⊂ X  is  a  closed  subset. 
Let  I  ⊂ O

for  every  x ∈ U  ∩ Z .  Show  that  I  is  a  sheaf  of  ideals  in OX . 
(2)  (i)  Let  Z  ⊂ A2  be  the  closed  subset  deﬁned  by  xy = 1.  Is  Z  irreducible?

(5)  Let D =  x2 + y 2  < 1} be  the  unit  disc  in R2  with  the  topology  induced  by  the  standard

(6) Let X  be a topological space, and {Ui} an open covering of X .  Suppose given a collection

such  tat  for  each  i  and  j ,  the maps  ψj  and  ϕij  ◦ ψi  over  Ui  ∩ Uj  are  equal. 
(7)  A  prevariety  X  is  called  rational  if  its  function  ﬁeld  k(X )  is  isomorphic  to  the  ﬁeld  of 
fractions  k(x1 , . . . , xn )  of  a  polynomial  ring  k [x1 , . . . , xn ]  for  some  n.  Let  X  ⊂  A4  be  the 
hypersurface  deﬁned  by  wx = yz .  Show  that X  is  rational.
