A2  be  the  blow–up  of  A2  at  the 

(1)  Assume  the  characteristic  of  k  is  not  2.  Let  b  :  X 
origin  (0, 0),  and  let  U  = A2  − { (0, 0)} . 
(i)  Show  that  the morphism  b−1 (U ) → U  is  an  isomorphism. 
(ii)  If  Z  ⊂ A2  is  a  closed  subset  not  equal  to  { (0, 0)} ,  the  strict  transform  of  Z  is  deﬁned 
to be  the  closure  of Z ∩ U  in X , where Z ∩ U  is viewed  as  a  subset  of X  via  the  isomorphism 
in  (i).  Compute  the  strict  transform  of  V (xy) ⊂ A2 . 
(iii)  Compute  the  strict  transform  of  V (y 2  − x2 (x + 1)) ⊂ A2 . 
(2)  Let  X  be  a  variety  and  x  ∈ X  a  point.  Denote  by  mx  ⊂ O X,x  the  maximal  ideal  of  the 
local  ring  O X,x .  Since  the  residue  ﬁeld  of  O X,x  is  k ,  the  quotient  m/m2  is  a  k–vector  space. 
Show  that 
dimk (m/m 2 ) ≥ dim(X ). 
Show  that  if O X,x  is  a  regular  local  ring,  then  this  in  fact  is  an  equality. 
(3) Let f  : X  → Y  be a non–constant ﬁnite morphism of varieties with dim(X ) = dim(Y ) = 1. 
Fix a point y ∈ Y  and let x1 , . . . , xr  be the points in f −1 (y).  Assume that the local rings O Y ,y 
and  {O X,xi } r
i=1  are  all  regular.  For  each  xi ,  let  e(xi )  denote  the  dimension  of  the  k–vector 
� 
space O X,xi /my O X,xi .  Show  that

e(xi ).

(4)  A  morphism  of  varieties  f  :  X  →  Y  is  said  to  be  projective  if  for  some  n  there  is  a 
factorization  of  f

where  j  identiﬁes X  with  an  irreducible  closed  subvariety  of  Pn  × Y . 
(i)  Show  that  a  pro jective morphism  is  closed. 
(ii)  If  Y  is  aﬃne,  show  that  any  ﬁnite morphism  f  : X  → Y  is  pro jective. 
(5) Suppose the characteristic of k  is p > 0.  On an earlier homework, we saw an example of a 
morphism  of  varieties  f  : X  → Y  which  was  not  an  isomorphism  but  was  a  homeomorphism 
on  the  underlying  topological  spaces. 
(i)  Let  Y  be  an  aﬃne  variety,  and  let  f  :  X  →  Y  be  a  morphism  of  varieties  whose  map 
on  underlying  spaces  is  a  homeomorphism.  Show  that X  is  aﬃne. 
(ii) Let R be the coordinate ring of Y , and  let X  be a second aﬃne variety with coordinate

necessary and suﬃcient conditions on the map f ∗  for the morphism f  to be a homeomorphism 
on  the  underlying  topological  spaces. 
(6)  Let X  ⊂ A3  be  the  zero  locus  of  z − xy .

(i)  Show  that  dim(X ) = 2. 
(ii)  Find  a  closed  subvariety  W  ⊂  X  of  codimension  1  which  is  not  of  the  form  V (g)  for 
some  g ∈ Γ(X, O X ). 
(7)  Fix  positive  integers N  and  r ,  and  let 
F  : (varieties) −→ (Set) 
be  the  contravariant  functor  which  to  any  variety  Y  associates  the  set  of  polynomials  in 
Γ(Y , O Y )[X1 , . . . , Xr ]  of  degree  N .  If  g  :  W  →  Y  is  a  morphism  of  varieties,  then  the  map 
F (Y ) → F (W )  is  the  one  induced  by  the map 
Γ(Y , O Y )[X1 , . . . , Xr ] −→ Γ(W, O W )[X1 , . . . , Xr ] 
induced  by  g ∗ .  Show  that  F  is  representable.  In  other  words,  there  exists  a  variety  M  and 
an  isomorphism  of  functors  hM  � F ,  where  hM  is  the  functor  sending  Y  to  Hom(Y , M ).
