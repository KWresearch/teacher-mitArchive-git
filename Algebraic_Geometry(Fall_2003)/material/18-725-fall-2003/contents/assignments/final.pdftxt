(1) Show that any complete smooth curve C  of genus 2 admits a ﬁnite morphism f  : C 
such  that  the  degree  of  the  ﬁeld  extension  k(P1 ) → k(C )  is  2.  Hint:  Look  at  Ω1 
C . 
(2)  Let  C  be  a  smooth  complete  curve  and  let  P1 , . . . , Pr  ∈  C  be  some  points.  Set  U  = 
C − {P1 , . . . , P .  Show  that  there  exists  a  non–constant  f  ∈ Γ(U, OC ).

(3)  (i)  Let  C  be  a  smooth  curve  which  is  not  complete.  Let  C  be  the  complete  smooth 
curve  associated  to  the  ﬁeld  of  rational  functions  k(C ).  Show  that  C  is  naturally  identiﬁed 
with  an  open  subset  of  C . 
(ii)  Combining  (2)  with  (i),  show  that  C  is  aﬃne.  Hint:  Use  (2)  to  show  that  there  exists

P1  such  that  g−1 (A1 ) =  C .  Then  show  that  C  is  aﬃne  with 
a  ﬁnite  morphism  g  :  C 
coordinate  ring  equal  to  the  normalization  of  k [x]  in  k(C ). 
(4)  Let  f (x)  ∈  k [x]  be  a  polynomial  of  degree  d ≥  1  with  no  multiple  roots.  Let  C  ⊂  A2 
be  the  aﬃne  curve  deﬁned  by 

2 y  = f (x). 
Let  C  be  the  closure  of  the  image  of  the map 
C  −→ Pg+2 , 
[x  : y ]  �→  [1 : x  : x 2  :  · · ·  : xg+1  : y ]. 
(i)  Show  that  C  is  a  complete  smooth  curve  and  that  C ∩ UX0=0  � C .

(ii) Write  f (x) = a0xd  + a1x

Show  that  C  has  an  open  cover  consisting  of  the  two  curves 
V (w 2  − g(v)) ⊂ A2 . 
V (y 2  − f (x)) ⊂ A2 ,
(iii)  Let  g  be  the  unique  integer  satisfying  d − 3 < 2g ≤ d − 1.  Show  that  the  curve  C  has 
genus  g . 
(5)  Extra  Credit:  You might  guess  that  Pn  should  represent  the  functor 
F  : (varieties) −→ (Set) 
which to any variety X associates the set of rank 1 free Γ(X, OX )–submodules L ⊂ Γ(X, OX )n+1 . 
Prove  that  this  guess  is  incorrect  by  showing  that  the  above  functor  F  is  not  representable. 
Hint:  morphisms  between  varieties  can  be  glued.
