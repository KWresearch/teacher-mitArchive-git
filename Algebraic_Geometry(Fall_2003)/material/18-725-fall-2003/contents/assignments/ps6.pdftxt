18.725:  EXERCISE  SET  6 

DUE  THURSDAY  OCTOBER  23 

(1)  Suppose  X  is  an  aﬃne  variety,  and  let  Δ  :  X  →  X  × X  be  the  diagonal  morphism. 
Describe  explicitly  the  ring map 
Γ(X × X, OX ×X ) −→ Γ(X, OX ). 

(2)  Let  X, Y , Z  be  three  prevarieties.  Show  that  there  is  a  natural  isomorphism  (where  the 
parentheses  indicate  in  which  order  you  do  the  products 
(X × Y ) × Z  � X × (Y  × Z ). 
(3)  Let  X  be  the  aﬃne  line  with  the  origin  doubled  discussed  in  class  (i.e.  two  copies  of  A1 
glued  along  A1  − {0}).  Describe  explicitly  the  product  X  × X  and  show  directly  that  the 
diagonal Δ(X ) ⊂ X × X  is  not  closed. 
(4)  Fix  a  positive  integer  d,  and  let M0 , . . . , MN  ∈ k [X0 , . . . , Xn ]  be  all  monomials  of  degree 
→ 
d.  The  Veronese  embedding  is  the morphism  Vd  : Pn 
PN  deﬁned  by 
: xn ) = (M0 (x)  : · · ·  : MN (x)).
Vd (x0  :  · · · 
(a)  Show  that  Vd  is  an  isomorphism  of  Pn  with  a  closed  pro jective  variety  in  PN . 
(b) Let S  ⊂ Pn  be a hypersurface deﬁned by a homogeneous polynomial f  ∈ k [X0 , . . . , Xn ] 
of  degree  d.  Show  that  S  = V −1 (H )  for  a  unique  hyperplane H  ⊂ PN .

(5) A group pre­variety  is a prevariety G together with morphisms m  : G×G
→
→
G, i  : G
G,
and an  identity element e ∈ G  such  that  the underlying  set  is a group with group  law deﬁned 
by m,  i,  and  e.  Show  that  any  group  pre­variety  is  a  variety. 
(6)  A  pre–variety  X  is  quasi–aﬃne  if  it  is  isomorphic  to  an  open  subset  of  an  aﬃne  variety. 
If X  is a prevariety and f  ∈ Γ(X, OX ),  let Xf  be  the open  set {x ∈ X f (x) = 0}.  Prove  that 
|
a  pre–variety  is  quasi–aﬃne  if  and  only  if  the  sets  Xf  for  f  ∈ Γ(X, OX )  form  a  base  for  the 
topology  of X . 
(7)  (Yoneda’s  lemma).  Let  C  be  a  category.  For  any  ob ject X  ∈ Ob(C ),  let 
hX  : C  −→ (Set) 
be the functor which to any Y  ∈ C  associates HomC (Y , X ).  Convince yourself (and the grader) 
that  hX  is  a  functor.  Then  show  that  if  Y  ∈ C  is  a  second  ob ject,  there  is  a  natural  bijection 
HomC (Y , X ) � Hom(hY  , hX ), 
where  Hom(hY  , hX )  is  the  set  of  natural  transformations  of  functors  hY 

hX .→

As  an  illustration,  consider  An  and  let  f1 , . . . , fn  ∈  k [X0 , . . . , Xn ]  be  some  polynomials. 
Taking  C  in  the  above  to  be  the  category  of  pre–varieties,  describe  the  functor  hAn  and  the 
morphism  of  functors  hAn  → hAn  giving  rise  to  the morphism  of  varieties 
(x1 , . . . , xn )  �→ (f1 (x), . . . , fn (x)).
