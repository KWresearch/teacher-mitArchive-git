18.725:  EXERCISE  SET  5  

DUE  THURSDAY   OCTOBER   16 

(1) Let  X  and  Y  be  prevarieties.   Deﬁne   hY  to  be  the  presheaf  on  X  which  to  any  open  set 
U  ⊂ X  associates  the  set  of  morphisms  of  prevarieties   U
→
Y   .  Show  that  hY  is   a  sheaf.  Also
show   that  when  Y  =  A1 ,  then  hY  is  just  OX  viewed   as   a  sheaf  of  sets. 
(2)  Let  k  be  an  algebraically   closed   ﬁeld,  K  and  K �  ﬁeld  extensions   of   k .  Show  that   K  ⊗k  K � 
� 
� 
is  again   a  ﬁeld.   Give   an  example  to   show  that   this  is  false  if  k  is   not  algebraically  closed. 
→ 
(3)  Fix  an  invertible  2  × 2  matrix 
a b 
.  Deﬁne  a  map  P1 
P1  by  sending [x  :  z ]  to 
c d 
[ax  +  bz  :  cx  +  dz ].   Show  that  this  is  an   automorphism  of  P1  (i.e.  a  morphism  which  is  an 
isomorphism). 
(4) Show   that   any   two  pro jective   varieties  in  P2  deﬁned   by  a  homogeneous  equation  of  degree  2 
are  isomorphic.  Hint:   look  up  classiﬁcation   of  quadratic  forms  for   example  in  Lang’s   Algebra. 
(5)  Let  E  ⊂  A2  be   the  aﬃne  variety  deﬁned  by  y − x − x  =  0.  Show  that   for  any  point 
3
2
P  ∈ E ,  the   set  E  − P  is  again  an  aﬃne  variety. 
(6)  (i)  Show   that  the  map  π  :  An+1  − {0}  →  Pn  sending  (x0 , .  .  .  ,  xn )  to  [x0  :  · · ·  :  xn ]  is  a 
morphism  of  prevarieties. 
(ii)  If  X  is  any  other  prevariety,  show  that  a  continuous   map   f  :  Pn  → X  is   a  morphism  if 
and   only  if   the  composite  f π  :  An+1  − {0} → X  is   a  morphism. 
◦
(7)  Explain  in  detail  what  it  means  to  say  that  the  product  of  two  prevarieties   is   unique. 

Correction to exercise 2:
K  ⊗k  K � 
k  K � 
k  K � 
k  K � 

Show that

 is an integral domain and that this is false if 'k' is not algebraically closed.
