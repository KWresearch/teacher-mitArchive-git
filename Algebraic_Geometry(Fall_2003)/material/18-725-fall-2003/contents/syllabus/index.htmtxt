***** Prerequisites *****
Students should have some familiarity with commutative algebra and basic
topology. Some more advanced algebraic topology may also be useful as might
some knowledge of category theory.
***** Plan of Course *****
The aim of this course is to introduce students to some basic notions and ideas
in algebraic geometry, paving the way for a study of Grothendiecks's theory of
schemes (second semester). Though the theory of schemes and cohomology is
generally accepted as the "right" setting for algebraic geometry, these
subjects require a substantial amount of technical language which to the
uninitiated can sometimes obscure the beauty and elegance of the subject. Thus
in an effort to make the subject more accessible and to give students basic
techniques without delving into a morass of technical details, I will not use
this language in this course but rather the more classical language of
varieties, which, though perhaps lacking the elegance of schemes, is perfectly
adequate for many situations in algebraic geometry. Thus the goal of the course
is more to give students a feeling for algebraic geometry, rather than to
develop the foundations of the subject, which students should learn in
subsequent courses on schemes.
My plan is to follow somewhat loosely the first chapter of Mumford's book at
the begining of the course, and then to discuss the appendix on curves and
their Jacobians. Other topics may be included as time permits.
Examples with emphasis on algebraic curves and surfaces are developed. The
course may be taken concurrently with 18.705, Commutative Algebra. Knowledge of
elementary algebraic topology and elementary differential geometry is
recommended, but not required.
