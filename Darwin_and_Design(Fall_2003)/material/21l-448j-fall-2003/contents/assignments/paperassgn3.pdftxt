21L448:  DARWIN AND DESIGN 
Fall, 2003

Professor Kibel 

 

FINAL ASSIGNMENT 

Papers are officially due on Dec 10th at 4PM.  In cases of extension, no paper will be 
accepted after December 16th  at 4 PM.  Papers should consist of approximately 8 
typed pages (figure 320 words/page).  As before, the following questions and topics 
are meant to be suggestive.  If you wish to modify them or invent a topic of your 
own, you may do so, but the object of the discussion should be one (or more) of the 
texts read and discussed so far this term and should deal centrally with one of the 
texts read since we undertook reading and discussion of Butler=s Erewhon.  Once 
again, please remember that you are writing an essay, not a book-report.  We have 
read the book and do not require a rehearsal of its contents.  What an essay does 
supply is some reminder of the contents in the context of an argument about those 
contents;  the reminder is offered in the course of explaining how one should 
understand or interpret those contents. 

Please try to avoid writing a sermon on any of the topics suggested below.  I am 
always interested in your views on life, but your primary task here is to exhibit your 
ability to read and interpret the texts read this term. 

Suggested Topics: 

Satire has targets; it intends to show up the irrationality of certain practices.  In 
addition to specific targets, every satire embodies a general view of what counts as 
irrational and what counts as rational, and for this reason, every satire has a general 
target--the source of much irrationality in human life.  To identify the general target 
(in this sense) of a satire is not always a simple task.  Compare the general targets 
of Erewhonand Candide. 

Here is a brief extract from some pages of Darwin's The Descent of Man that we did 
not read: 

Man in the rudest state in which he now exists is the most dominant 
animal that has ever appeared on this earth.  He has spread more 
widely than any other highly organized form: and all others have 
yielded before him.  He manifestly owes this immense superiority to 
his intellectual faculties, to his social habits, which lead him to aid and 
defend his fellows, and to his corporeal structure.  The supreme 
importance of these characters has been proved by the final 
arbitrament of the battle for life. 

How well does the notion of dominion invoked here accord with the view of selective 
advantage expressed in the Origin?  How apt are the criteria for its use?  How valid 
is Darwin's explanation of the causes of this "dominance"?  Compare the notions in 

the extract from Darwin's Descent with those of Butler on the domination of 
machines and of Huxley and Wells on "the final arbitrament [i.e., judgement] of the 
battle for life". 

Butler presents two views of mankind's relation to machinery in "The Book of the Machines", one of 
which is used to plead for the destruction of all machinery in the kingdom of Erewhon, the other used to 
plead for its preservation.  Are the views really opposed?  How do they compare with views on machinery 
of any two other writers read this term? 

Butler prefaced the second edition of Erewhon with a disclaimer to the effect that he was not poking fun at 
Darwin in "The Book of Machines".  The real target, he said, was the poor use of analogy.  We have met 
quarrels about analogy in Hume and Paley and it must be said that Darwin, despite Butler's disclaimer, 
relies heavily on analogy to make a case directly opposite to Paley's.  Is Butler's disclaimer to be accepted 
at face value?  How well has Butler captured the Darwinian use of analogy? 

Erewhon is "nowhere" spelled backwards, with a slight concession to pronouncibility.  To what extent is 
reversal the principle of satire in the book?  What are some of its targets and how does the technique of 
reversal apply to Butler's treatment of them?  Is the idea of reversal applied consistently?  Does any general 
sort of target appear to be the main concern (perhaps only implicit, not necessarily explicit) of the book?  
Compare Butler and Voltaire as satirists.  If the object of society is the establishment of a stable, 
predictable code upon which individuals may depend, what are the comparative merits of Voltaire's 
Eldorado and Butler's Erewhon.  How does a world of rational behavior compare with one devoted to the 
following of Ygrund? 

The judge in Butler's Erewhon speaks in condemnation of the man whose wife has died:  "You have 
suffered a great loss.  Nature attaches a severe penalty to such offenses, and human law must emphasize 
the decrees of nature."  In the same way, Erewhonians regard luck, health, success (or their opposites, ill-
fortune, disease, failure), as if they were ethical attributes, and criminality as non-ethical, something that 
can be pitied or ameliorated.  What is the underlying distinction between the ethical and the non-ethical 
that is at work here?  Is the Erewhonian system of justice consistent?  If not, is that a fault in Butler's book? 

Compare and/or contrast the relation between the ethical and the natural in any 
two texts text read this term.  How consonant, for example, is the position taken by 
Huxley's call to resist nature with the position elaborated by Darwin at the end of 
The Descent of Man?  We may recall the passage cited in class: 

The advancement of the welfare of mankind is a most intricate 
problem: all ought to refrain from marriage who cannot avoid abject 
poverty for their children;  for poverty is not only a great evil, but 
tends to its own increase by leading to recklessness in marriage.  On 
the other hand, . . . if the prudent avoid marriage, whilst the reckless 
marry, the inferior members tend to supplant the better members of 
society.  Man, like every other animal, has no doubt advanced to his 
present high condition through a struggle for existence consequent on 
his rapid multiplication;  and if he is to advance still higher, it is to be 
feared that he must remain subject to a severe struggle.  Otherwise he 
would sink into indolence, and the more gifted men would not be more 
successful in the battle of life than the less gifted.  Hence our natural 
rate of increase, though leading to many and obvious evils, must not be 

greatly diminished by any means.  There should be open competition 
for all men; and the most able should not be prevented by laws or 
customs from succeeding best and rearing the largest number of 
offspring. 

If artificial should replace natural selection among human beings, should we practice 
eugenics?  Comment, using specific passages to illuminate the position that might be 
taken by Huxley on this issue.  (And please refrain from sermonizing upon the issue:  
we are testing your competence in dealing with these texts, not your ethical fervor.) 

The above passage linked "struggle for existence" with "advancement".  Certain 
writers whom we have read do not think that standing still is possible in the life of a 
species--it is either "advancement" or "decline".  Comment with specific reference to 
authors and texts.  Butler's book of machines depends in part on the "willingness" 
of machines to suffer individual extinction for the good of the species of machines as 
a whole.  Is this consonant with Darwin=s view on species?  Does this make 
machinery a danger to mankind? 

What is the occasion for Huxley=s argument?  What view of the implications of Darwinism is he trying to 
discredit?  Huxley opposes the State of Nature and the Human State of Art (that is to say, artifice, the 
intelligent management of things) and insists that the two are in conflict.  What was Aristotle=s view of this 
relationship?  How would an intelligent Darwinist argue against Huxley=s notion of a conflict?  Huxley 
links the State of Nature with Cosmic Nature and argues that on earth human artifice is the product of 
cosmic nature.  If it seems contradictory, then, to speak of art as resisting cosmic nature, Huxley says, that 
is just too bad for logic.  Is the opposition logically contradictory?  How does Huxley attempt to show that 
cosmic nature itself in the case of human beings transforms the struggle between members of a species into 
a  cooperative effort to contain that struggle.  Is his case convincing? 

The emblem of artifice chosen by Huxley is the GardenBan image of nature, by implication, as thoroughly 
under control of human artifice as might be, Awhere every plant and every lower animal should be adapted 
to human wants and would perish if human supervision and protection were withdrawn@.  How does this 
garden compare with the garden in Genesis?  How does its supervision compare with the idea of breeding 
domestic animals in the first chapter of Darwin=s Origin?  What is the serpent in the garden?  Is the idea of 
transforming the environment of humanity good but impractical, in Huxley=s view, or ultimately possible, 
or a false ideal, inherently wrongheaded?  In answering, take into account Huxley=s view that direct 
selection of the best humans would be undesirable not just because we lack the knowledge to select the 
fittest but also because it cannot Abe practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of 
the bonds which holds society together.@  Also take into account his view that the struggle for existence 
among human beings in industrial nations is just about over and the real struggle now is a struggle for 
conveniences and luxuries. 

The story of Jekyll and Hyde has been taken sometimes as a warning against 
science=s meddling with nature, at times as a moral tract warning against loosening 
the hold of the ethical self upon one=s baser or more animal impulses.  Discuss the 
validity and/or the limits of either of these views. 

Discuss the adequacy of the account that Jekyll gives of his aim in developing his 
Hyde-creating drug.  A good deal goes into it in very brief spaceBJekyll speaks of 

two elements of his soul and of the advantages of liberating one from the other. 
How coherent is this enterprise?  Jekyll says that Athe drug had no discriminating 
action@  and simply liberated the element active when one was taking it, leaving the 
other unaffected.  Does this mean, as Jekyll says, that taken in the right spirit, it 
would have made him a saint?  If so, what becomes of the notion that the moral of 
the book is never to indulge the evil side of one=s character? 

Describe carefully the relationship between the two sides of Jekyll=s double being, as 
Jekyll himself understands it.  How does each think of the other?  Jekyll says that 
during the last nine months he has labored exhaustively and even enjoyably at the 
good work of relieving the sufferings of others in order to make up for Hyde=s 
actions. The story, however, will not let this remain a stable position.  What 
unbalances it?  Why is Hyde described as having more life in him than Jekyll?  In 
this connection, examine with care the long paragraph (third from the end of the 
story) in which Jekyll details the final relationship between the two sides of his 
character.  Jekyll=s loathing of Hyde might seem complete, yet he describes Hyde in 
such a way as to lead to the conclusion: I find it in my heart to pity him. How 
adequate is Hyde as a representation of what Jekyll calls Amy original evil@?  How 
tempted is Jekyll to become all Hyde?  How closely does he identify himself with 
Hyde at various moments during the course of Jekyll=s narrative? 

Both Wells (in The Time Machine) and Stevenson write stories in which two sides 
of human nature are conceived as potentially separable--but the division is not 
conceived in the same way.  Mankind is a composite creature, but the elements of 
the composition differ.  Comment. 

Wells's The Time Machine seems to accept Huxley's viewpoint in Evolution and Ethics.  Hardship and 
struggle, foster the human capacity for intelligence (recall Malthus, too). To put this in Huxley's terms, 
natural selection, in producing humans, has produced something that opposes the work of natural selection 
in favor of cooperation and the use of natural forces for the benefit of the human species. Paradoxically, 
however, intelligence, by removing the need for struggle, may remove the selective advantage of 
intelligence. Hence, the existence of Eloi and Morlocks, neither of which are very intelligent or cultured. 
Has intelligence thus led to the victory of the cosmic process over intelligence and culture, which seem to 
be missing in Wells's futuristic world? 

A more general version of the same question:  AAll the ethical points made by Huxley are present in The 
Time Machine but translated into vision.@ This statement (by the critic J. P. Vernier) is a commonplace of 
observation about Wells's scientific romance. Comment by comparing selected aspects of the two books. 

Wells's The Island of Dr Moreau seems to accept many elements of Huxley's 
viewpoint.  Mankind has evolved from animal nature by dint of pain (Huxley would 
say, hardship and struggle);  the force behind evolution (Huxley's "cosmic process", 
Wells's Dr Moreau) is without morality;  the creatures thus produced have to create 
their own morality.  Comment on the parallel and how far it can be drawn. 

In various ways, the discourses of Huxley and Wells modify the idea of "perfection", 
a term used with some insistence by Darwin.  As Huxley points out, although the 
process of natural selection may be said to perfect, it does so only in relationship to 
the particular situation of a given species--its particular conditions of life.  Under 

many imaginable conditions, therefore, "perfection" by the standards of natural 
selection can be "degeneration" by the standards of ethics.  This notion is not only 
applicable to Wells=s treatment of the Morlocks and the Eloi but also to the 
distinction between Moreau and his creatures.  The Islandof Dr Moreau raises the 
question whether the animals, in becoming more human-like, have been "improved", 
as opposed to merely "altered".  And it also raises the question whether Moreau 
represents a further evolution of mankind, for Moreau seems himself to be like the 
being that he hopes to create one dayBa rational creature free from the Ataint of the 
beast@, no longer in bondage to fear of pain and therefore a creature still an animal, 
Athinking a little less obscurely what an animal feels.@  Compare and contrast the 
division implied here between the creatures and the ultimate human with the 
distinction between Morlock and Eloi or the distinction between Jekyll and Hyde. 

In a sense, Wells's The Island of Dr Moreau  gives us a double dose of pessimism.  In the first 
place, Dr. Moreau expresses a conviction that Athe study of Nature makes a man at last as remorseless as 
Nature.@  Is Darwinian Nature remorseless?  Is Huxley=s cosmic nature remorseless?  In the second place, if 
Moreau acts in the manner of Nature, what is the remorselessness of Nature remorseless about?  Moreau is 
devoted to investigate the limits of Athe plasticity of living forms@, but he seems to have no interest 
whatsoever in ameliorating the conditions of human life thereby.   Is the investigation a worthy goal in 
itself?  What oppresses Prendrick about the island at the end of the bookBwhen he suffers, so to speak, 
from a spiritual hangoverBis the aimlessness of things there.  Is this aimlessness in line with a Darwinian 
view of life on planet Earth? 

Take the opening episode of The Island of Dr Moreau, the account of the struggle for life in the boat, and 
show how it relates to the central themes of the story as a whole.   Or take the last chapter and compare it 
with the last paragraph of Darwin=s Origin in order to estimate how closely Wells was influenced by the 
Darwinian view of things, if not by the Origin itself.  Darwin contrasts the eternal regularity of cosmic 
nature with the complex changefulness of biological history, whereas Prendick, although educated by 
Huxley, seeks solace in the study of astronomy. 

Wells claimed to be a disciple of Huxley.  He has Prendick doing research with Huxley Aas a relief from 
the dullness@ of his leisured existence.  In a book one of whose central terms is Aaimlessness@, this is a 
significant qualification.  He also has Prendick refer (in a long passage concluding Chapter 16) to the 
aimlessness of things on the island and to the fact that Moreau has wrenched the creatures on the island 
from their condition as beasts (this is Prendick's usual word), in which their instincts were Afitly adapted to 
their surroundings@ and made into something unfitted for any natural existence.  What are the implications 
of Abestiality@ and Amark of the beast@?  Why not refer just to Aanimal nature@?  Is this idea of fitness in 
accord with Huxley's?  With Darwin?  By the same token:  Are the beasts on the island, in their lack of 
fitness of adaptation, apt models for human beings?  In what way?  Prendick regards with horror the notion 
that humans would be turned into beasts, but is somewhat pacified to begin with by the notion that beasts 
are being turned into humans.  Does the course of the story alter this view?  What does the story say as a 
whole about the relation of humanity to nature (in any relevant sense of the word Anature@)? 

Moreau claims to be a religious man, Aas every sane man must be@.  What does he 
mean by this?  At one point, Moreau does seem  to have more in mind than just 
exploring Athe plasticity of living forms@.  While complaining that somehow he 
cannot get at the seat of emotions, which, in his view, Aharm humanity@, he says 
that he wants to create a creature of his own which is truly rational.  Does Moreau 
himself possess the sorts of emotions that he is complaining about?  Is he striving to 

create a rational creature Ain his own image@?  Would this make the creature more 
or less human?  Alternatively, is the liability to emotion a Amark of the beast@, as 
Moreau claims? 

Forster=s The Machine Stops was written partially in response to Well=s Time 
Machine.  Compare the two texts in order to highlight Forster=s reworking of Well=s 
materials and show how this reworking serves Forster=s purposes.  How does 
Forster=s text capture Huxley=s idea of a world entirely subdued to artifice?  What 
are the significant differences?  How extensively do Forster=s views about the effects 
that an end to the Astruggle for existence@ will have on mankind parallel Wells=s? 
How do they differ?  Does Forster=s book match up with the fears expressed by the 
author of the ABook of the Machine@ in Erewhon?  What view would the second 
author in ErewhonBthe one who wrote in answer to the author of AThe Book of the 
Machine@Bbe likely to take of the implications of Forster=s story? 

What are "ideas" in The Machine Stops?  Why does Vashti "get no ideas" from 
those parts of the natural world that mankind naturally inhabits?  What is meant 
by "the terrors of direct experience"?  If the inhabitants of the Machine have indeed 
lost all sense of "direct experience" (whatever that is), has their devotion to "ideas" 
played any role in this?  Are there any correlatives in our contemporary world to 
the "ideas" that are so central to human life in Forster's story?  What does Kuno 
mean when he says that mankind is the measure of all things?  Kuno says that 
people "worship" the Machine.  Can a Machine be worshiped? 

Each year, writes Forster, the machine is served more efficiently and less 
intelligently.  Is this possible?  Can people be part of a machine (or a machine-like process)? 
Would you regard the workers on an assembly-line as serving the conveyor belt, which embodies an idea 
of consecutive assembly that the workers do not have to grasp to perform their function?   Can one regard 
the factory itself as a machine in which the workers are functioning parts? 

What does it mean to live inside a machine?  Is the machinery simply a metaphor, a stand-in for features of 
human relationships that Forster judged adversely?  Or is the story actually about machinery and what 
happens to human relationships when human relationships become dependent upon machines, particularly 
in the way of communication?  Or can these questions both be answered affirmativelyCby raising the 
possibility that the story is about something in human nature (of which Forster does not approve) which 
does not depend upon the existence of machinery but which is encouraged by an increasing reliance of 
human beings to manage their relationships with one another by means of machines? 

The question, can computers really think? may be regarded as another version of 
the question, does nature really select?  As nature exhibits design, so behavior 
(linguistic or otherwise) exhibits consciousness.  How far does the parallel go?  
Discuss in relation to the packet of readings on Artificial Intelligence, selfish genes, 
or any other text read this term. 

How well-suited is the Imitation Game to the purpose for which Turing intends it?  Are the conditions of 
the game adequate to serve as a decisive example that machines can think?  Suppose that we set up a rock 
so that it dropped on the foot of anyone who shoved his or her foot through a hole in a wall.  Would we be 
entitled to say that the rock has successfully Aimitated@ a malicious human being behind the hole and we 
can confidently expect the rock to take on more human qualities in fifty years time? 

In a passage not included in your reading, Turing seems to nod in the direction of such an argument when 
he writes:  A The reader will have anticipated that I have no very convincing arguments of a positive nature 
to support my views. If I had I should not have taken such pains to point out the fallacies in contrary 
views.@  How would you characterize the contrary views?  Which of them do you think is the most 
formidable?  How successfully has Turing dealt with it? 

A similar set of questions apply to Searle=s case against what he calls Astrong AI@.  How would you 
characterize the AI views?  Which of them do you think is the most formidable?  How successfully does 
Searle deal with it?  Unlike Turing=s adversaries, Searle does not deny that  machines can think;  he denies 
only that machines that must be programmed to simulate thinking can think.  Why is the idea of being 
programmed to think, in his view, disqualifying?  How much difference does this make to the force of his 
objections?  AIn strong AI,@ he writes, Awhat matters are programs, and programs are independent of their 
realization in machines.@  He hints that this is a version, on the part of proponents of Astrong AI@, of the 
view that soul is distinct from body or mind from brain.  What is your view of this issue? 

How far does the AChinese Room@ example duplicate the situation of those inside Forster=s machine?  We 
may recall the reply given to AThe Book of the Machines@ by the second author in Erewhon to the effect 
that  machines are simply extensions of human beings, who may one day (like Wells=s Martians in The 
War of the Worlds) spend their lifetimes inside ever-more powerful machines and manipulate the world at 
their pleasure.  How close does this come to the ASystems Reply@ in Searle=s essay, in which the whole 
system, not just the little man inside, understands Chinese? 

Like Paley, the writer of Butler's "Book of Machines" compares the eye to the 
microscope and the telescope (the little and big "see-engines").  He writes:  "What 
is a man's eye but a machine for the little creature that sits behind in his brain to 
look through?"  The word "machine" here should not disturb us;  it means 
"contrivance".  But what of the "little creature"?  If there is a little creature that 
uses the eye to look through, what does the little creature see with?  Starting from 
this question, compare the various writings on computer intelligence distributed this 
term.  Does a machine or contrivance always serve a purpose?  If human beings are 
composed of machines or contrivances, and if the human brain is also a contrivance 
(as Butler hints in the paragraph after the one just cited), what is the entity for 
which it performs a function or a service? 

Compare Searle=s views with those of Daniel Dennett in AIntentional systems@. 
Searle writes:  AWe say, >The door knows when to open because of its photoelectric cell,= >The adding 
machine knows how (understands how, is able) to do addition and subtraction but not division,= and >The 
thermostat perceives changes in the temperature.= The reason we make these attributions is quite 
interesting, and it has to do with the fact that in artifacts we extend our own intentionality; our tools are 
extensions of our purposes, and so we find it natural to make metaphorical attributions of intentionality to 
them; but I take it no philosophical ice is cut by such examples.@ Compare this passage with 
Dennett, who writes: A Any time a theory builder proposes to call any event, state, structure, etc., in 
any system (say the brain of an organism) a signal or message or command or otherwise endows it with 
content, he takes out a loan of intelligence.  . . . The intentionality of all such talk of signals and commands 
reminds us that rationality is being taken for granted, and in this way shows us where a theory is 
incomplete. . . . [W]herever a theory relies on a formulation bearing the logical marks of intentionality, 
there a little man [within the brain] is concealed.@  In the light of this remarkBwhich urges us 
to find explanation for intention in terms of design and explanation of design in 

terms of natural selectionBwhere does Dennett stand on the quarrel between Searle 
and the proponents of what Searle calls Astrong AI@?  Would Dennett agree or disagree that 
the use of intentional idioms should Acut no ice@ in understanding whether or not machines actually think? 

AA hen is but an egg=s way of making another egg,@ said Samuel Butler (but not in 
Erewhon).  Dawkins=s arguments in The SelfishGene and elsewhere seem to 
elaborate this remark, the spirit of which is already present in AThe Book of the 
Machines@, when its author argues that both humans and machines, considered as 
species, are involved in a common life-cycle in which humans foster the existence of 
machines, which in turn fosters human existence, which in turn . . . etc.  Butler=s 
author concludes that the cycle exists for the purpose of producing machines, not 
the other way around, and it is part of Butler=s satire to make his Erewhonians take 
this idea seriously.  Dawkins takes the opposite tackBthe machines are not the 
beneficiaries of the cycleBbut he also argues that we are the machines. >We are . . . 
robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes. 
This is a truth which still fills me with astonishment@ What are the grounds for 
Dawkins=s argument that we serve the interests of genes?  Comment on the relation 
between Butler=s author and Dawkins in any way that seems to illuminate the 
argument of one or the other. 

Various aspects of Dawkins=s arguments seem to recall the arguments by Searle and 
Dennett about the Aintentionality@ of such things as machines, only here, in the 
phrase Athe selfish gene@, the intentionality belongs to viral-like lengths of 
chromosome.  Compare Dawkins=s argument about the Abehaviorist@ definition of 
selfishness with the quarrel about ascribing intentionality to machines in any way 
that seems useful.  How does the issue here bear upon Darwin=s remarks about the 
confusions prompted by his use of the term ANatural Selection@ and his insistence 
that Aselection@  is just a metaphor? 

Stephen Gould is critical alike of gene-selection and of group-selection as theories 
describing the targets of Natural Selection.  How would his criticisms affect Huxley=s 
argument in Evolution and Ethics?  What might Dawkins say in answers to his 
criticisms?
