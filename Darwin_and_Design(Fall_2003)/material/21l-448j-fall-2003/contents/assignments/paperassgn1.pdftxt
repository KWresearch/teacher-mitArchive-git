21L448:  DARWIN AND DESIGN 
Fall, 2003

Professor Kibel 

 

FIRST PAPER TOPICS 

Papers are due on October 2 and should consist of five double-spaced pages 
with one-inch margins.  This should give you something about 8,500 
characters in substanceBi.e., not counting titles, pages numbers, large-sized 
type and huge margins..  On the title page of your papers (which does not 
count as a page in your submission and which should NOT be numbered) I 
want you to include a character-count of the document (less the title page) 
which any reasonable word-processing program will provide.  Each page of 
the document itself must be numbered.  I will NOT accept unnumbered 
pages. 

The following questions and topics are meant to be suggestive.  If you wish 
to modify them or invent a topic of your own, you may do so.  Indeed, I 
rather hope that you will do so;  the point of the suggestions is to get you 
thinking;  they are not to be followed as if they provided an algorithm for a 
successful paper.  In any case, the object of the discussion should be one (or 
more) of the texts read and discussed so far this term and should deal with 
issues centrally relevant to both the text and to the subject-matter of our 
discussions in class.  (If you choose to write about the Bible, for example, we 
are not interested in discussions of its authority.)  Offer a view, supported by 
argument.  Do not sermonize about the topics that you discuss. 

Please remember that you are writing an essay, not a book-report.  We have 
all (presumably) read the book under discussion and do not require a 
rehearsal of its contents.  (A book-report fills up pages, but they are all 
empty calories, intellectually.)  What an essay does supply is some reminder 
of the contents in the context of an argument about those contentsBa 
reminder offered in the course of explaining how one should understand or 
interpret them. 

Any good, short, coherent essay will be arguing something.  It will help you 
to write the essay if you can announce (to yourself or to the reader) the 
overall point that you are trying to make.  Such a point should not be self-
evident;  you should be able to state an opposing point (the one that you are 
denying) which is not so obvious or so silly that no one would be able to 
argue for it, even as you are taking five pages to argue against it. 

SUGGESTIONS: 

Give a careful account of Aristotle=s four causes and explain the relationship 
among them, so that Aristotle sounds as if he had a plausible view of what is 
natural.  What does Aristotle mean by Acause@ (aitia, plural aitiai)? 

Whatever they are, they have to do with change and are inherent in the 
nature of things.  Do we believe that particular kinds of change are 
sometimes inherent properties of things?  Or is change induced by 
externalities?  Or both? 

Aristotle quarrels with four viewpoints in the course of his exposition.  He 
quarrels with Antiphon=s view of the nature of a bed, he quarrels with 
Empedocles explanation of why we have teeth, he quarrels with those who 
think that the cosmos came about by chance, and he quarrels with those who 
believe that material causes offer a sufficient reason why things are as they 
are.  What is at issue in any one or more of these quarrels and how does it 
the quarrel help to illuminate Aristotle=s general view? 

Inherent principles of change each make for change in a particular way.  This 
way is called its telos, its end, its aim, its goal.  Things in the world all 
possess a telos, and the purposeful activities of human beings constitute only 
one sort of teleological activity.  Do we still employ teleological descriptions 
of the nature and activity of things?  If things are properly described 
teleologically, does it follow that they have purposes? 

The translation often used for expressing the idea that something happening 
in a telicway is Afor the sake of@. In most usage this phrase generally imputes 
consciousness, deliberationBa prelude to actions that are deliberateBand it 
may seem odd, at first blush, to use it of non-human changes.  But is it? 
Trees do not put out branches deliberately; of course, but we are willing to 
say that they branch in order to grow more leaves for the sake of providing 
themselves with more surface for sunlight.  What sort of question does this 
kind of expression answer and how Aristotelian are we when we employ it? 

What view of the nature of things is expressed in the first chapter of 
Genesis?  How does it compare with Aristotle=s view? 

Discuss the idea of Ainnocence@  in two of the following:  the second chapter of 
Genesis, Alice=s Adventures in Wonderland, Candide. 

One cannot say that Alice=s Adventures in Wonderland is a satire, but 
something is the point of the jokesBthe arbitrary ways in which the creatures 
behave, the way they talk down to Alice, the way they expect her to 
understand what cannot be comprehended by the reader, their curious use of 
language, which the child is always trying to fathom.  How would you 
describe Alice=s character and her relation to the dream-creatures?  What (to 
take an instance) is the point made by the Caucus-race, where every 
contestant starts and stops where and when they like, and everyone must 
have a victory-prize?  Or is it just plain absurdity, without, as Alice says at 
one point about something said by one of the creatures., Aan atom of 
meaning in it.@  

The Caucus-race and, in fact, growth in general in the book is very un-
AristotelianBgrowth usually has an external cause, it starts when she likes 
and leaves off when she likes, or if it doesn=t, then she learns how to control 
it (or, in the case of the Rabbit=s fan) to avoid it..  Only at the end, when 
the dream is breaking up, does she start to grow in the Aristotelian way, and 
then the Dormouse (from the Latin root dor-, having to do with sleep) tells 
her that she has Ano right to grow here@, as if growth was the result of an 
external force that we might learn to control.  Comment in any way relevant 
to your sense of the book as a whole. 

"How the creatures love to argue!" thinks Alice of the inhabitants of 
Wonderland.  Compare the argumentative tendencies of any two characters 
from Alice=s Adventures in Wonderlandand Candide. 

A Atheodicy@ (from the Greek words theosand dike, god and justice, 
respectively) is, among other things, an argument confronting the view that 
evil exists with the view that the universe was created by an omnipotent, 
benevolent deity. Develop a thesis that compares the theodicy of one or 
more of the following:  Cleanthes at the end of Hume=s Dialogue, the Turkish 
dervish (i.e., philosopher) at the end of Candide, Martin, Pangloss. 

Voltaire is obviously, as a satirist, pushing a point of view on a number of 
topics in Candide, yet he chooses to write a narrative rather than speak 
directly.  What is gained or lost by Voltaire's not stating his position 
outright? 

What is the target of satire, over-all, in Candide?  If the satire is directed 
principally at AOptimism@, why does Pangloss have such a minor role?  Why 
does the book conclude with the advice:  ALet us cultivate our garden@?  Is 
this a sound piece of ethical wisdom?  Most of the events that might spur 
one to renounce optimism are not human in origin.  Offhand, I can think 
only of two:  the plague (mentioned by the old woman) and the earthquake 
at Lisbon, which was a topic of much philosophic comment at the end of the 
eighteenth-century, and even here, the issue has mostly to do with human 
responses to the disaster.  Is the book, then, not concerned with theodicy?  
Does this help explain the inclusion of the El Dorado episode in the book? 

Discuss the El Dorado episode and its relation to the rest of the text in any 
way that seems illuminating of the whole.  Why does Candide choose to 
leave it?  Would you leave it?  More importantly, given his characteristic 
way of behaving, was Candide wise or foolish in leaving it?  What view do 
you think Voltaire meant the reader to take of El Dorado? 

"This is the best of all possible worlds."  Some take this as an expression of 
optimism, others of deep pessimism.  Are both views represented in 
Candide?  On which side (optimist or pessimist) would you put Hume's 
Cleanthes and why?  How would Cleanthes fare with his religious position in 
El Dorado? 

Outline the course of discussion in Hume's Dialogues.  (This is quite distinct 
from providing a summary.  Who speaks?  What do they stand for?  How 
does the discussion proceed?  What are the major topics and why are they 
raised in the order in which Hume presents them?) 

Hume=s Dialogues begins (in a passage that I did not have you read) with a 
discussion of the appropriateness of the dialogue form to certain topics.  
What is gained or lost by Hume not addressing his reader in his own person? 
With whom do you think his sympathies are most investedBPhilo or 
Cleanthes?  Argue the validity of your answer. 

Identify the elements of the quarrel between Cleanthes and Philo as they 
first make their appearance in Part II?  Do they remain the basis 
throughout?  Philo gives an account of Cleanthes=s position to which 
Cleanthes assents.  Roughly:  experience shows us that matter does not 
spontaneously order itself but ideas do.  How close is this to the position 
taken by Aristotle in dealing with chance in his quarrel with Empedocles?   

The last question might be extended:  the self-evidence of design, insisted 
upon by Cleanthes, is Aristotelian; in contrast, the notion that the design is 
not inherent in things but has to come from an external source (and 
ultimately from a deliberating intelligence) is not.  What would Aristotle 
have made of this text if he could have read it? 

What is the point of the two examplesBthe voice in heaven and the library of 
vegetables--adduced in Part III against objections that Philo has made up to 
that moment?  Are they well chosen to make Cleanthes=s case?  The idea of 
a vegetating library used to be thought particularly absurd by scholars and 
was often used to argue that Hume sided with Philo rather than with 
Cleanthes?  Comment. 

In Part IV, Philo makes a point by alluding to an Indian myth explaining 
the earth=s position in the cosmos.  The myth has it that the earth is 
supported on the back of an elephant.  Is this a bad explanation?  Philo 
thinks so, and applies it to what Cleanthes has been saying, that the order or 
design of material features of the world imply an orderer or a designer.  He 
offers an Aristotelian view of things in contrast (without mentioning 
Aristotle).  Cleanthes replies by adducing the Principle of Sufficient 
ReasonBI have accounted for design.  That is enough.  Is his reply the right 
one? 

In Part VII, Philo makes a point against Demea by again reverting to 
Aristotle:  Demea insists at moments in the text that tracing back the chain 
of causation requires something more than just an endless chain.  Something 
must have been responsible for the initiation of the chain of causes, to get 
things going (an application of the principle of Sufficient Reason to the whole 
chain).  Philo tries to short-circuit Demea=s argument at this juncture by 

reviving the idea that substance can have a principle of growth in itself. 
How good are the cases at this point?  Has Philo simply revived his earlier 
notion in Part IV or has he advanced his conception? 

In Part V, Philo suggests two possibilities that follow from Cleanthes=s 
viewsBthat the world is a botch-job, but we cannot tell, being inferior to the 
divine workman, or that it isn=t a botch-job but was put together over many 
generations by relatively unintelligent beings.  Elucidate these possibilities.  
Is Cleanthes right in his response to them? 

At the outset of Part XI, Cleanthes has something to say about the idea of 
infinityand it leads him to conclude that we have no option but to think 
that God is benevolent, but limited by necessity.  What is the force of this 
argument?  How does it relate to the notion that this is, after all, Athe best 
of all possible worlds@? 

In Part XI, Philo raises four objections to Cleanthes view that the world 
shows evidence of a benevolent (and perhaps limited) Creator.  Are these 
objections sound?  How good are Philo=s answers to them? 

Many scholars believed that Hume did not publish this text in his lifetime 
because he believed its view too radical to be exposed to the general public.  
What, in your opinion, is radical about the text?  Is there such a thing as 
forbidden knowledge, of which the Ainnocent@ should not partake?
