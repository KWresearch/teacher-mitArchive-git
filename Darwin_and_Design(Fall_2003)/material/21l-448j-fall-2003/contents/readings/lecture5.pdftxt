Excerpts from David Hume=s Dialogues concerning Natural Religion 

ANatural Religion@ was a phrase appropriated to the notion of religious knowledge 
that did not depend upon a Revelation by GodCthe sort of religious doctrine that 
human beings could reason out for themselves without divine assistance.  One 
assumption of Christianity had been that humanity was either too weak or too 
corrupt in mind (or both) to think clearly about religious fundamentals and that 
God in his mercy had revealed these fundamentals in the form of holy scriptures, 
whose interpretation conveyed doctrine about the nature of deity.  Since the 
sixteenth century, however, the idea grew steadily that mankind could infer certain 
features of God=s existence by use of unaided reason in the study of the natural 
universe and its laws; this idea (associated with the view that God was immanent in 
the created world) was designated Atheism@ in the eighteenth-century.  Closely allied 
with theism was the view of deism, which held that reason could establish the 
existence of God, quite apart from knowledge of his characteristics;  this idea 
sometimes carried with it the notion that the fact of his existence was all we could 
know about him without divine revelation. 

Hume=s dialogue was composed in the decade before 1651 but was not published 
until after his death, in 1779, and the belief of most scholars is that he thought the 
doctrines it espoused were too radical to be exposed to the general public during his 
lifetime.  But then, too, scholars are divided upon which of the three participants in 
the dialogues expresses Hume=s view.  Hume is regarded as a skeptical philosopher, 
and most scholars suppose that the voice of Philo belongs to Hume, because it most 
clearly exploits the skepticism latent in the deist position, which employed a battery 
of skeptical arguments in defense of its idea that unassisted reason could not 
establish anything about the attributes of God other than that He existed. The 
participants have names appropriate to an ancient Greek philosophical dialogue, a 
form of writing familiar to Hume=s audience and one that would seem appropriate to 
a religious discussion that never draws upon the authority of the Old or the New 
Testament.  The dialogues are narrated by APamphilus@ to AHermippus@ as a 
conversation that Pamphilus was permitted to overhear as a young student.  The 
three interlocutors in the conversation are Demea, a deist, Cleanthes, a theist, and 
the aforementioned Philo, who presents himself sometimes as deist, sometimes as a 
theist, but mostly as an outright skeptic.  I have omitted virtually everything in the 
text that pertains to Demea, who is given the poorest arguments in the book and 
who departs at some point in the text, thoroughly scandalized by the discussion 
between the theist and the skeptic. 

The dialogue consists of thirteen AParts@  of which the first turns to the general 
subject of the education of the young in religious matters.  At the outset of the 
second Part, where we pick up the dialogue, Demea has been maintaining that 
knowledge of God=s existence must be a priori, that is to say, it is a truth that is not 
known on the basis of experience but is logically prior to experience, because it is 

the kind of truth that must be assumed (like rules of logic) if we are to be coherent 
in speaking about anything at all.  Truths arising from experience are termed a 
posteriori, and Demea also contends that things known a posteriori, that is, by 
experience, are inappropriate to any description of God.  In contrast, Cleanthes has 
been suggesting that experience has some scope in the matter.  Philo, the skeptic, 
intervenes at this point apparently to restate Demea=s position more forcefully. 

From Part II 
[When we speak of God, says Philo, we must] piously ascribe to him every species of 
perfection. Whoever scruples this fundamental truth, deserves every punishment 
which can be inflicted among philosophers, to wit, the greatest ridicule, contempt, 
and disapprobation. But as all perfection is entirely relative, we ought never to 
imagine that we comprehend the attributes of this divine Being, or to suppose that 
his perfections have any analogy or likeness to the perfections of a human creature. 
Wisdom, Thought, Design, Knowledge; these we justly ascribe to him; because these 
words are honorable among men, and we have no other language or other 
conceptions by which we can express our adoration of him. But let us beware, lest 
we think that our ideas correspond in any way to his perfections, or that his 
attributes have any resemblance to these qualities among men. He is infinitely 
superior to our limited view and comprehension; and is more the object of worship 
in the temple, than of disputation in the schools. 

In reality, Cleanthes, continued he, there is no need of having recourse to that 
affected scepticism so displeasing to you, in order to come at this determination. 
Our ideas reach no further than our experience. We have no experience of divine 
attributes and operations. I need not conclude my syllogism. You can draw the 
inference yourself. And it is a pleasure to me (and I hope to you too) that just 
reasoning and sound piety here concur in the same conclusion, and both of them 
establish the adorably mysterious and incomprehensible nature of the Supreme 
Being. 

Not to lose any time in circumlocutions, said Cleanthes, addressing himself to 
Demea, much less in replying to the pious declamations of Philo; I shall briefly 
explain how I conceive this matter. Look round the world: contemplate the whole 
and every part of it: you will find it to be nothing but one great machine, 
subdivided into an infinite number of lesser machines, which again admit of 
subdivisions to a degree beyond what human senses and faculties can trace and 
explain. All these various machines, and even their most minute parts, are adjusted 
to each other with an accuracy which ravishes into admiration all men who have 
ever contemplated them. The curious adapting of means to ends, throughout all 
nature, resembles exactly, though it much exceeds, the productions of human 
contrivance; of human designs, thought, wisdom, and intelligence. Since, therefore, 
the effects resemble each other, we are led to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that 
the causes also resemble; and that the Author of Nature is somewhat similar to the 
mind of man, though possessed of much larger faculties, proportioned to the 
grandeur of the work which he has executed. By this argument a posteriori, and by 

this argument alone, do we prove at once the existence of a Deity, and his similarity 
to human mind and intelligence. . . . 

What I chiefly scruple in this subject, said Philo, is not so much that all religious 
arguments are by Cleanthes reduced to experience, as that they appear not to be 
even the most certain and irrefragable of that inferior kind. [Ed.  noteBthe superior 
kind are a prioriarguments.]  That a stone will fall, that fire will burn, that the 
earth has solidity, we have observed a thousand and a thousand times; and when 
any new instance of this nature is presented, we draw without hesitation the 
accustomed inference. The exact similarity of the cases gives us a perfect assurance 
of a similar event; and a stronger evidence is never desired nor sought after. But 
wherever you depart, in the least, from the similarity of the cases, you diminish 
proportionably the evidence; and may at last bring it to a very weak analogy, which 
is confessedly liable to error and uncertainty. After having experienced the 
circulation of the blood in human creatures, we make no doubt that it takes place in 
Titius and Maevius. But from its circulation in frogs and fishes, it is only a 
presumption, though a strong one, from analogy, that it takes place in men and 
other animals. The analogical reasoning is much weaker, when we infer the 
circulation of the sap in vegetables from our experience that the blood circulates in 
animals; and those, who hastily followed that imperfect analogy, are found, by more 
accurate experiments, to have been mistaken. 
If we see a house, Cleanthes, we conclude, with the greatest certainty, that it had an 
architect or builder; because this is precisely that species of effect which we have 
experienced to proceed from that species of cause. But surely you will not affirm, 
that the universe bears such a resemblance to a house that we can with the same 
certainty infer a similar cause, or that the analogy is here entire and perfect. The 
dissimilitude is so striking, that the utmost you can here pretend to is a guess, a 
conjecture, a presumption concerning a similar cause; and how that pretension will 
be received in the world, I leave you to consider. 

It would surely be very ill received, replied Cleanthes; and I should be deservedly 
blamed and detested, did I allow, that the proofs of a Deity amounted to no more 
than a guess or conjecture. But is the whole adjustment of means to ends in a house 
and in the universe so slight a resemblance? the economy of final causes1?  the 
order, proportion, and arrangement of every part? Steps of a stair are plainly 
contrived, that human legs may use them in mounting; and this inference is certain 
and infallible. Human legs are also contrived for walking and mounting; and this 
inference, I allow, is not altogether so certain, because of the dissimilarity which you 
remark; but does it, therefore, deserve the name only of presumption or conjecture? 
. . . 

[Demea finds the idea that the evidence is imperfect sacrilegious and chastises Philo 
for apparently accepting it.  Philo replies:] You seem not to apprehend, replied 

1In the case of the house, not only are means adjusted to ends (e.g., hinges are contrived 
to serve for opening and closing doors) but the ends all fit together in service to an idea of 
habitation. 

Philo, that I argue with Cleanthes in his own way; and, by showing him the 
dangerous consequences of his tenets, hope at last to reduce him to our opinion. But 
what sticks most with you, I observe, is the representation which Cleanthes has 
made of the argument a posteriori; and finding that that argument is likely to 
escape your hold and vanish into air, you think it so disguised, that you can scarcely 
believe it to be set in its true light. Now, however much I may dissent, in other 
respects, from the dangerous principles of Cleanthes, I must allow that he has fairly 
represented that argument; and I shall endeavor so to state the matter to you, that 
you will entertain no further scruples with regard to it. 

Were a man to abstract from every thing which he knows or has seen, he would be 
altogether incapable, merely from his own ideas, to determine what kind of scene 
the universe must be, or to give the preference to one state or situation of things 
above another. For as nothing which he clearly conceives could be esteemed 
impossible or implying a contradiction, every chimera of his fancy would be upon an 
equal footing; nor could he assign any just reason why he adheres to one idea or 
system, and rejects the others which are equally possible. 

Again; after he opens his eyes, and contemplates the world as it really is, it would 
be impossible for him at first to assign the cause of any one event, much less of the 
whole of things, or of the universe. He might set his fancy a rambling; and she 
might bring him in an infinite variety of reports and representations. These would 
all be possible; but being all equally possible, he would never of himself give a 
satisfactory account for his preferring one of them to the rest. Experience alone can 
point out to him the true cause of any phenomenon. 

Now, according to this method of reasoning, Demea, it follows, (and is, indeed, 
tacitly allowed by Cleanthes himself,) that order, arrangement, or the adjustment of 
final causes, is not of itself any proof of design; but only so far as it has been 
experienced to proceed from that principle. For ought we can know a priori, matter 
may contain the source or spring of order originally within itself as well as mind 
does; and there is no more difficulty in conceiving, that the several elements, from 
an internal unknown cause, may fall into the most exquisite arrangement, than to 
conceive that their ideas, in the great universal mind, from a like internal unknown 
cause, fall into that arrangement. The equal possibility of both these suppositions is 
allowed. But, by experience, we find, (according to Cleanthes) that there is a 
difference between them. Throw several pieces of steel together, without shape or 
form; they will never arrange themselves so as to compose a watch. Stone, and 
mortar, and wood, without an architect, never erect a house. But the ideas in a 
human mind, we see, by an unknown, inexplicable economy, arrange themselves so 
as to form the plan of a watch or house. Experience, therefore, proves, that there is 
an original principle of order in mind, not in matter. From similar effects we infer 
similar causes. The adjustment of means to ends is alike in the universe, as in a 
machine of human contrivance. The causes, therefore, must be resembling. 

I was from the beginning scandalized, I must own, with this resemblance, which is 
asserted, between the Deity and human creatures; and must conceive it to imply 
such a degradation of the Supreme Being as no sound Theist could endure. With 

your assistance, therefore, Demea, I shall endeavor to defend what you justly call 
the adorable mysteriousness of the Divine Nature, and shall refute this reasoning of 
Cleanthes, provided he allows that I have made a fair representation of it. 

When Cleanthes had assented, Philo, after a short pause, proceeded in the following 
manner. 

That all inferences, Cleanthes, concerning fact, are founded on experience; and that 
all experimental reasonings are founded on the supposition that similar causes prove 
similar effects, and similar effects similar causes; I shall not at present much dispute 
with you. But observe, I entreat you, with what extreme caution all just reasoners 
proceed in the transferring of experiments to similar cases. Unless the cases be 
exactly similar, they repose no perfect confidence in applying their past observation 
to any particular phenomenon. Every alteration of circumstances occasions a doubt 
concerning the event; and it requires new experiments to prove certainly, that the 
new circumstances are of no moment or importance. A change in bulk, situation, 
arrangement, age, disposition of the air, or surrounding bodies; any of these 
particulars may be attended with the most unexpected consequences: and unless the 
objects be quite familiar to us, it is the highest temerity to expect with assurance, 
after any of these changes, an event similar to that which before fell under our 
observation. The slow and deliberate steps of philosophers here, if any where, are 
distinguished from the precipitate march of the vulgar, who, hurried on by the 
smallest similitude, are incapable of all discernment or consideration. 

But can you think, Cleanthes, that your usual phlegm and philosophy have been 
preserved in so wide a step as you have taken, when you compared to the universe 
houses, ships, furniture, machines, and, from their similarity in some circumstances, 
inferred a similarity in their causes? Thought, design, intelligence, such as we 
discover in men and other animals, is no more than one of the springs and principles 
of the universe, as well as heat or cold, attraction or repulsion, and a hundred 
others, which fall under daily observation. It is an active cause, by which some 
particular parts of nature, we find, produce alterations on other parts. But can a 
conclusion, with any propriety, be transferred from parts to the whole? Does not the 
great disproportion bar all comparison and inference? From observing the growth of 
a hair, can we learn any thing concerning the generation of a man? Would the 
manner of a leaf's blowing, even though perfectly known, afford us any instruction 
concerning the vegetation of a tree? But, allowing that we were to take the 
operations of one part of nature upon another, for the foundation of our judgment 
concerning the origin of the whole, (which never can be admitted,) yet why select so 
minute, so weak, so bounded a principle, as the reason and design of animals is 
found to be upon this planet? What peculiar privilege has this little agitation of the 
brain which we call thought, that we must thus make it the model of the whole 
universe? Our partiality in our own favor does indeed present it on all occasions; but 
sound philosophy ought carefully to guard against so natural an illusion. . . . 

Admirable conclusion! Stone, wood, brick, iron, brass, have not, at this time, in this 
minute globe of earth, an order or arrangement without human art and contrivance; 
therefore the universe could not originally attain its order and arrangement, without 

something similar to human art. But is a part of nature a rule for another part very 
wide of the former? Is it a rule for the whole? Is a very small part a rule for the 
universe? Is nature in one situation, a certain rule for nature in another situation 
vastly different from the former? . . .  When two species of objects have always been 
observed to be conjoined together, I can infer, by custom, the existence of one 
wherever I see the existence of the other; and this I call an argument from 
experience. But how this argument can have place, where the objects, as in the 
present case, are single, individual, without parallel, or specific resemblance, may be 
difficult to explain. And will any man tell me with a serious countenance, that an 
orderly universe must arise from some thought and art like the human, because we 
have experience of it? To ascertain this reasoning, it were requisite that we had 
experience of the origin of worlds; and it is not sufficient, surely, that we have seen 
ships and cities arise from human art and contrivance. 

Philo was proceeding in this vehement manner, somewhat between jest and earnest, 
as it appeared to me, when he observed some signs of impatience in Cleanthes, and 
then immediately stopped short. What I had to suggest, said Cleanthes, is only that 
you would not abuse terms, or make use of popular expressions to subvert 
philosophical reasonings. You know, that the vulgar often distinguish reason from 
experience, even where the question relates only to matter of fact and existence; 
though it is found, where what they call reason is properly analyzed, that it is 
nothing but a species of experience. To prove by experience the origin of the 
universe from mind, is not more contrary to common speech, than to prove the 
motion of the earth from the same principle. And a caviler might raise all the same 
objections to the Copernican system, which you have urged against my reasonings. 
Have you other earths, might he say, which you have seen to move? HaveC 

Yes! cried Philo, interrupting him, we have other earths. Is not the moon another 
earth, which we see to turn round its center? Is not Venus another earth, where we 
observe the same phenomenon? Are not the revolutions of the sun also a 
confirmation, from analogy, of the same theory? All the planets, are they not earths, 
which revolve about the sun? Are not the satellites moons, which move round 
Jupiter and Saturn, and along with these primary planets round the sun? These 
analogies and resemblances, with others which I have not mentioned, are the sole 
proofs of the Copernican system; and to you it belongs to consider, whether you 
have any analogies of the same kind to support your theory. . . . 

Part III (entire) 

How he most absurd argument, replied Cleanthes, in the hands of a man of 
ingenuity and invention, may acquire an air of probability! Are you not aware, 
Philo, that it became necessary for Copernicus and his first disciples to prove the 
similarity of the terrestrial and celestial matter; because several philosophers, 
blinded by old systems, and supported by some sensible appearances, had denied 
that similarity? but that it is by no means necessary, that Theists should prove the 
similarity of the works of Nature to those of Art; because this similarity is 
self-evident and undeniable? The same matter, a like form; what more is requisite to 

shew an analogy between their causes, and to ascertain the origin of all things from 
a divine purpose and intention? Your objections, I must freely tell you, are no 
better than the abstruse cavils of those philosophers who denied motion2; and ought 
to be refuted in the same manner, by illustrations, examples, and instances, rather 
than by serious argument and philosophy. 

Suppose, therefore, that an articulate voice were heard in the clouds, much louder 
and more melodious than any which human art could ever reach: suppose, that this 
voice were extended in the same instant over all nations, and spoke to each nation 
in its own language and dialect: suppose, that the words delivered not only contain a 
just sense and meaning, but convey some instruction altogether worthy of a 
benevolent Being, superior to mankind: could you possibly hesitate a moment 
concerning the cause of this voice? and must you not instantly ascribe it to some 
design or purpose? Yet I cannot see but all the same objections (if they merit that 
appellation) which lie against the system of Theism, may also be produced against 
this inference. 

Might you not say, that all conclusions concerning fact were founded on experience: 
that when we hear an articulate voice in the dark, and thence infer a man, it is only 
the resemblance of the effects which leads us to conclude that there is a like 
resemblance in the cause: but that this extraordinary voice, by its loudness, extent, 
and flexibility to all languages, bears so little analogy to any human voice, that we 
have no reason to suppose any analogy in their causes: and consequently, that a 
rational, wise, coherent speech proceeded, you know not whence, from some 
accidental whistling of the winds, not from any divine reason or intelligence? You 
see clearly your own objections in these cavils, and I hope too you see clearly, that 
they cannot possibly have more force in the one case than in the other. 

But to bring the case still nearer the present one of the universe, I shall make two 
suppositions, which imply not any absurdity or impossibility. Suppose that there is a 
natural, universal, invariable language, common to every individual of human race; 
and that books are natural productions, which perpetuate themselves in the same 
manner with animals and vegetables, by descent and propagation. Several 
expressions of our passions contain a universal language: all brute animals have a 
natural speech, which, however limited, is very intelligible to their own species. And 
as there are infinitely fewer parts and less contrivance in the finest composition of 
eloquence, than in the coarsest organized body, the propagation of an Iliad or 
Aeneid is an easier supposition than that of any plant or animal. 

2 The reference is to Zeno of Elea, who argued that anyone proposing to walk a certain distance would have to go some 
portion of the distance before going the remainder, and of that portion would have to go a certain portion before reaching the 
limit of it as well, and so on, for every subdivision of the initial part of the journey.  Since distance can be infinitely divided, the 
traveller cannot be said to complete any part of the journey at all. 

Suppose, therefore, that you enter into your library, thus peopled by natural 
volumes, containing the most refined reason and most exquisite beauty; could you 
possibly open one of them, and doubt, that its original cause bore the strongest 
analogy to mind and intelligence? When it reasons and discourses; when it 
expostulates, argues, and enforces its views and topics; when it applies sometimes to 
the pure intellect, sometimes to the affections; when it collects, disposes, and adorns 
every consideration suited to the subject; could you persist in asserting, that all this, 
at the bottom, had really no meaning; and that the first formation of this volume in 
the loins of its original parent proceeded not from thought and design? Your 
obstinacy, I know, reaches not that degree of firmness: even your skeptical play and 
wantonness would be abashed at so glaring an absurdity. 

But if there be any difference, Philo, between this supposed case and the real one of 
the universe, it is all to the advantage of the latter. The anatomy of an animal 
affords many stronger instances of design than the perusal of Livy or Tacitus; and 
any objection which you start in the former case, by carrying me back to so unusual 
and extraordinary a scene as the first formation of worlds, the same objection has 
place on the supposition of our vegetating library. Choose, then, your party, Philo, 
without ambiguity or evasion; assert either that a rational volume is no proof of a 
rational cause, or admit of a similar cause to all the works of nature. 

Let me here observe too, continued Cleanthes, that this religious argument, instead 
of being weakened by that scepticism so much affected by you, rather acquires force 
from it, and becomes more firm and undisputed. To exclude all argument or 
reasoning of every kind, is either affectation or madness. The declared profession of 
every reasonable sceptic is only to reject abstruse, remote, and refined arguments; 
to adhere to common sense and the plain instincts of nature; and to assent, 
wherever any reasons strike him with so full a force that he cannot, without the 
greatest violence, prevent it. Now the arguments for Natural Religion are plainly of 
this kind; and nothing but the most perverse, obstinate metaphysics can reject 
them. Consider, anatomize the eye; survey its structure and contrivance; and tell 
me, from your own feeling, if the idea of a contriver does not immediately flow in 
upon you with a force like that of sensation. The most obvious conclusion, surely, is 
in favor of design; and it requires time, reflection, and study, to summon up those 
frivolous, though abstruse objections, which can support Infidelity. Who can behold 
the male and female of each species, the correspondence of their parts and instincts, 
their passions, and whole course of life before and after generation, but must be 
sensible, that the propagation of the species is intended by Nature? Millions and 
millions of such instances present themselves through every part of the universe; 
and no language can convey a more intelligible irresistible meaning, than the curious 
adjustment of final causes. To what degree, therefore, of blind dogmatism must one 
have attained, to reject such natural and such convincing arguments? 

Some beauties in writing we may meet with, which seem contrary to rules, and 
which gain the affections, and animate the imagination, in opposition to all the 
precepts of criticism, and to the authority of the established masters of art. And if 
the argument for Theism be, as you pretend, contradictory to the principles of logic; 
its universal, its irresistible influence proves clearly, that there may be arguments of 

a like irregular nature. Whatever cavils may be urged, an orderly world, as well as a 
coherent, articulate speech, will still be received as an incontestable proof of design 
and intention. 

It sometimes happens, I own, that the religious arguments have not their due 
influence on an ignorant savage and barbarian; not because they are obscure and 
difficult, but because he never asks himself any question with regard to them. 
Whence arises the curious structure of an animal? From the copulation of its 
parents. And these whence? From their parents? A few removes set the objects at 
such a distance, that to him they are lost in darkness and confusion; nor is he 
actuated by any curiosity to trace them further. But this is neither dogmatism nor 
scepticism, but stupidity: a state of mind very different from your sifting, inquisitive 
disposition, my ingenious friend. You can trace causes from effects: you can compare 
the most distant and remote objects: and your greatest errors proceed not from 
barrenness of thought and invention, but from too luxuriant a fertility, which 
suppresses your natural good sense, by a profusion of unnecessary scruples and 
objections. 

Here I could observe, Hermippus, that Philo was a little embarrassed and 
confounded: but while he hesitated in delivering an answer, luckily for him, Demea 
broke in upon the discourse, and saved his countenance. 

Your instance, Cleanthes, said he, drawn from books and language, being familiar, 
has, I confess, so much more force on that account: but is there not some danger too 
in this very circumstance; and may it not render us presumptuous, by making us 
imagine we comprehend the Deity, and have some adequate idea of his nature and 
attributes? When I read a volume, I enter into the mind and intention of the 
author: I become him, in a manner, for the instant; and have an immediate feeling 
and conception of those ideas which revolved in his imagination while employed in 
that composition. But so near an approach we never surely can make to the Deity. 
His ways are not our ways. His attributes are perfect, but incomprehensible. And 
this volume of nature contains a great and inexplicable riddle, more than any 
intelligible discourse or reasoning. 

The ancient Platonists, you know, were the most religious and devout of all the 
Pagan philosophers; yet many of them, particularly Plotinus, expressly declare, that 
intellect or understanding is not to be ascribed to the Deity; and that our most 
perfect worship of him consists, not in acts of veneration, reverence, gratitude, or 
love; but in a certain mysterious self-annihilation, or total extinction of all our 
faculties. These ideas are, perhaps, too far stretched; but still it must be 
acknowledged, that, by representing the Deity as so intelligible and comprehensible, 
and so similar to a human mind, we are guilty of the grossest and most narrow 
partiality, and make ourselves the model of the whole universe. 

All the sentiments of the human mind, gratitude, resentment, love, friendship, 
approbation, blame, pity, emulation, envy, have a plain reference to the state and 
situation of man, and are calculated for preserving the existence and promoting the 
activity of such a being in such circumstances. It seems, therefore, unreasonable to 

transfer such sentiments to a supreme existence, or to suppose him actuated by 
them; and the phenomena besides of the universe will not support us in such a 
theory. All our ideas derived from the senses are confusedly false and illusive; and 
cannot therefore be supposed to have place in a supreme intelligence: and as the 
ideas of internal sentiment, added to those of the external senses, compose the whole 
furniture of human understanding, we may conclude, that none of the materials of 
thought are in any respect similar in the human and in the divine intelligence. Now, 
as to the manner of thinking; how can we make any comparison between them, or 
suppose them anywise resembling? Our thought is fluctuating, uncertain, fleeting, 
successive, and compounded; and were we to remove these circumstances, we 
absolutely annihilate its essence, and it would in such a case be an abuse of terms to 
apply to it the name of thought or reason. At least if it appear more pious and 
respectful (as it really is) still to retain these terms, when we mention the Supreme 
Being, we ought to acknowledge, that their meaning, in that case, is totally 
incomprehensible; and that the infirmities of our nature do not permit us to reach 
any ideas which in the least correspond to the ineffable sublimity of the Divine 
attributes. 

 From Part IV 

[Philo offers a reductio ad absurdum] 
. . . How . . . shall we satisfy ourselves concerning the cause of that Being whom you 
[Cleanthes] suppose the Author of Nature, or, according to your system of 
Anthropomorphism, the ideal world, into which you trace the material? Have we 
not the same reason to trace that ideal world [i.e., a world that operates upon 
material things but is not material] into another ideal world, or new intelligent 
principle? But if we stop, and go no further; why go so far? why not stop at the 
material world? How can we satisfy ourselves without going on in infinitum? And, 
after all, what satisfaction is there in that infinite progression? Let us remember the 
story of the Indian philosopher and his elephant.3 It was never more applicable than 
to the present subject. If the material world rests upon a similar ideal world, this 
ideal world must rest upon some other; and so on, without end. It were better, 
therefore, never to look beyond the present material world. By supposing it to 
contain the principle of its order within itself, we really assert it to be God; and the 
sooner we arrive at that Divine Being, so much the better. When you go one step 
beyond the mundane system, you only excite an inquisitive humor which it is 
impossible ever to satisfy. 

To say, that the different ideas which compose the reason of the Supreme Being, fall 
into order of themselves, and by their own nature, is really to talk without any 
precise meaning. If it has a meaning, I would fain know, why it is not as good sense 
to say, that the parts of the material world fall into order of themselves and by their 
own nature. Can the one opinion be intelligible, while the other is not so? 

3 .  The reference is to an Indian philosophy who claimed that the world was supported in space by resting upon the 
back of an elephant.  To the question, AWhat does the elephant rest upon?@ the philosopher replied, AAnother elephant@. 

We have, indeed, experience of ideas which fall into order of themselves, and 
without any known cause. But, I am sure, we have a much larger experience of 
matter which does the same; as, in all instances of generation and vegetation, where 
the accurate analysis of the cause exceeds all human comprehension. We have also 
experience of particular systems of thought and of matter which have no order; of 
the first in madness, of the second in corruption. Why, then, should we think, that 
order is more essential to one than the other? And if it requires a cause in both, 
what do we gain by your system, in tracing the universe of objects into a similar 
universe of ideas? The first step which we make leads us on for ever. It were, 
therefore, wise in us to limit all our enquiries to the present world, without looking 
further. No satisfaction can ever be attained by these speculations, which so far 
exceed the narrow bounds of human understanding. 

It was usual with the Peripatetics, you know, Cleanthes, when the cause of any 
phenomenon was demanded, to have recourse to their faculties or occult qualities; 
and to say, for instance, that bread, nourished by its nutritive faculty, and senna 
purged by its purgative. But it has been discovered, that this subterfuge was 
nothing but the disguise of ignorance; and that these philosophers, though less 
ingenuous, really said the same thing with the sceptics or the vulgar, who fairly 
confessed that they knew not the cause of these phenomena. In like manner, when it 
is asked, what cause produces order in the ideas of the Supreme Being; can any 
other reason be assigned by you Anthropomorphites than that it is a rational faculty 
and that such is the nature of the Deity? But why a similar answer will not be 
equally satisfactory in accounting for the order of the world, without having 
recourse to any such intelligent creator as you insist on, may be difficult to 
determine. It is only to say, that such is the nature of material objects, and that 
they are all originally possessed of a faculty of order and proportion. These are only 
more learned and elaborate ways of confessing our ignorance; nor has the one 
hypothesis any real advantage above the other, except in its greater conformity to 
vulgar prejudices. 

You have displayed this argument with great emphasis, replied Cleanthes. You seem 
not sensible how easy it is to answer it. Even in common life, if I assign a cause for 
any event, is it any objection, Philo, that I cannot assign the cause of that cause, 
and answer every new question which may incessantly be started? And what 
philosophers could possibly submit to so rigid a rule? philosophers, who confess 
ultimate causes to be totally unknown; and are sensible, that the most refined 
principles into which they trace the phenomena, are still to them as inexplicable as 
these phenomena themselves are to the vulgar. The order and arrangement of 
nature, the curious adjustment of final causes, the plain use and intention of every 
part and organ; all these bespeak in the clearest language an intelligent cause or 
author. The heavens and the earth join in the same testimony: the whole chorus of 
Nature raises one hymn to the praises of its Creator. You alone, or almost alone, 
disturb this general harmony. You start abstruse doubts, cavils, and objections: you 
ask me, what is the cause of this cause? I know not; I care not; that concerns not 
me. I have found a Deity; and here I stop my enquiry. Let those go further, who are 
wiser or more enterprising. 

I pretend to be neither, replied Philo: and for that very reason, I should never 
perhaps have attempted to go so far; especially when I am sensible, that I must at 
last be contented to sit down with the same answer, which, without further trouble, 
might have satisfied me from the beginning. If I am still to remain in utter 
ignorance of causes, and can absolutely give an explication of nothing, I shall never 
esteem it any advantage to shove off for a moment a difficulty, which, you 
acknowledge, must immediately, in its full force, recur upon me. Naturalists indeed 
very justly explain particular effects by more general causes, though these general 
causes themselves should remain in the end totally inexplicable; but they never 
surely thought it satisfactory to explain a particular effect by a particular cause, 
which was no more to be accounted for than the effect itself. An ideal system, 
arranged of itself, without a precedent design, is not a whit more explicable than a 
material one, which attains its order in a like manner; nor is there any more 
difficulty in the latter supposition than in the former.4 

From Part V 

But to shew you still more inconveniences, continued Philo, in your 
Anthropomorphism, please to take a new survey of your principles. Like effects 
prove like causes. This is the experimental argument; and this, you say too, is the 
sole theological argument. Now, it is certain, that the liker the effects are which are 
seen, and the liker the causes which are inferred, the stronger is the argument. 
Every departure on either side diminishes the probability, and renders the 
experiment less conclusive. You cannot doubt of the principle; neither ought you to 
reject its consequences. . . 

Now, Cleanthes, said Philo, with an air of alacrity and triumph, mark the 
consequences. First, By this method of reasoning, you renounce all claim to infinity 
in any of the attributes of the Deity. For, as the cause ought only to be 
proportioned to the effect, and the effect, so far as it falls under our cognizance, is 
not infinite; what pretensions have we, upon your suppositions, to ascribe that 
attribute to the Divine Being? You will still insist, that, by removing him so much 
from all similarity to human creatures, we give in to the most arbitrary hypothesis, 
and at the same time weaken all proofs of his existence. 

4This statement may be prompted by Cleanthes=s example of the Avegetating library@ and stand for its denial. 

Secondly, You have no reason, on your theory, for ascribing perfection to the Deity, 
even in his finite capacity, or for supposing him free from every error, mistake, or 
incoherence, in his undertakings. There are many inexplicable difficulties in the 
works of Nature, which, if we allow a perfect author to be proved a priori, are easily 
solved, and become only seeming difficulties, from the narrow capacity of man, who 
cannot trace infinite relations. But according to your method of reasoning, these 
difficulties become all real; and perhaps will be insisted on, as new instances of 
likeness to human art and contrivance. At least, you must acknowledge, that it is 
impossible for us to tell, from our limited views, whether this system contains any 
great faults, or deserves any considerable praise, if compared to other possible, and 
even real systems. Could a peasant, if the Aeneid were read to him, pronounce that 
poem to be absolutely faultless, or even assign to it its proper rank among the 
productions of human wit, he, who had never seen any other production? 

But were this world ever so perfect a production, it must still remain uncertain, 
whether all the excellences of the work can justly be ascribed to the workman. If we 
survey a ship, what an exalted idea must we form of the ingenuity of the carpenter 
who framed so complicated, useful, and beautiful a machine? And what surprise 
must we feel, when we find him a stupid mechanic, who imitated others, and copied 
an art, which, through a long succession of ages, after multiplied trials, mistakes, 
corrections, deliberations, and controversies, had been gradually improving? Many 
worlds might have been botched and bungled, throughout an eternity, ere this 
system was struck out; much labor lost, many fruitless trials made; and a slow, but 
continued improvement carried on during infinite ages in the art of world-making. 
In such subjects, who can determine, where the truth; nay, who can conjecture 
where the probability lies, amidst a great number of hypotheses which may be 
proposed, and a still greater which may be imagined? 

And what shadow of an argument, continued Philo, can you produce, from your 
hypothesis, to prove the unity of the Deity? A great number of men join in building 
a house or ship, in rearing a city, in framing a commonwealth; why may not several 
deities combine in contriving and framing a world? This is only so much greater 
similarity to human affairs. By sharing the work among several, we may so much 
further limit the attributes of each, and get rid of that extensive power and 
knowledge, which must be supposed in one deity, and which, according to you, can 
only serve to weaken the proof of his existence. And if such foolish, such vicious 
creatures as man, can yet often unite in framing and executing one plan, how much 
more those deities or demons, whom we may suppose several degrees more perfect! 

To multiply causes without necessity, is indeed contrary to true philosophy: but this 
principle applies not to the present case. Were one deity antecedently proved by 
your theory, who were possessed of every attribute requisite to the production of 
the universe; it would be needless, I own, (though not absurd,) to suppose any other 
deity existent. But while it is still a question, Whether all these attributes are 
united in one subject, or dispersed among several independent beings, by what 
phenomena in nature can we pretend to decide the controversy? Where we see a 
body raised in a scale, we are sure that there is in the opposite scale, however 
concealed from sight, some counterpoising weight equal to it; but it is still allowed 

to doubt, whether that weight be an aggregate of several distinct bodies, or one 
uniform united mass. And if the weight requisite very much exceeds any thing 
which we have ever seen conjoined in any single body, the former supposition 
becomes still more probable and natural. An intelligent being of such vast power 
and capacity as is necessary to produce the universe, or, to speak in the language of 
ancient philosophy, so prodigious an animal exceeds all analogy, and even 
comprehension. 

But further, Cleanthes: men are mortal, and renew their species by generation; and 
this is common to all living creatures. The two great sexes of male and female, says 
Milton, animate the world. Why must this circumstance, so universal, so essential, 
be excluded from those numerous and limited deities? Behold, then, the theogony of 
ancient times brought back upon us.  And why not become a perfect 
Anthropomorphite? Why not assert the deity or deities to be corporeal, and to have 
eyes, a nose, mouth, ears, etc.? Epicurus maintained, that no man had ever seen 
reason but in a human figure; therefore the gods must have a human figure. And 
this argument, which is deservedly so much ridiculed by Cicero, becomes, according 
to you, solid and philosophical. 

In a word, Cleanthes, a man who follows your hypothesis is able perhaps to assert, 
or conjecture, that the universe, sometime, arose from something like design: but 
beyond that position he cannot ascertain one single circumstance; and is left 
afterwards to fix every point of his theology by the utmost license of fancy and 
hypothesis. This world, for aught he knows, is very faulty and imperfect, compared 
to a superior standard; and was only the first rude essay of some infant deity, who 
afterwards abandoned it, ashamed of his lame performance: it is the work only of 
some dependent, inferior deity; and is the object of derision to his superiors: it is the 
production of old age and dotage in some superannuated deity; and ever since his 
death, has run on at adventures, from the first impulse and active force which it 
received from him. You justly give signs of horror, Demea, at these strange 
suppositions; but these, and a thousand more of the same kind, are Cleanthes's 
suppositions, not mine. From the moment the attributes of the Deity are supposed 
finite, all these have place. And I cannot, for my part, think that so wild and 
unsettled a system of theology is, in any respect, preferable to none at all. 

These suppositions I absolutely disown, cried Cleanthes: they strike me, however, 
with no horror, especially when proposed in that rambling way in which they drop 
from you. On the contrary, they give me pleasure, when I see, that, by the utmost 
indulgence of your imagination, you never get rid of the hypothesis of design in the 
universe, but are obliged at every turn to have recourse to it. To this concession I 
adhere steadily; and this I regard as a sufficient foundation for religion. 

From Parts VI, VII, VIII 

[In these chapters, Philo develops a series of positions starting with the notion that 
it is arbitrary to deny an internal principle of order in matter while granting such a 
principle to ideas, for matter might have such a principle as well, so far as we know. 

We have evidence from experience that we create machinery by forming an idea of 
related and adjusted parts in our minds and then executing our design upon 
materials that would never assume such relations and adjustments of themselves; 
we also have evidence from experience that without forming ideas, plants and 
animals also impart organization upon material things in producing offspring. 
Cleanthes wants to argue that since organisms resemble machines, ultimately the 
organization of plants and animals must have come from an intelligence of some 
kind.  Philo wants to argue that Cleanthes cannot earn this ultimatelywithout 
departing from experience and that for all we know ultimatelymatter has its own 
principle of order.  Indeed, he concludes, if we had to pick one ultimate source of 
order (either animals and plants are like machines and the way that they reproduce 
had its ultimate origins in a planning intelligence or machines are like animals and 
plants and planning intelligence had its ultimate origin in material reproduction), 
experience lends more weight to the latter than to the former hypothesis. 
Our excerpt pick up at a point where Cleanthes has been adducing various 
sorts of examples culled from natural history, indicating that the world cannot have 
been in existence for an infinite time, since many botanical species have only 
recently been transplanted to climates suitable for them, and it is unreasonable to 
imagine that no one would have thought of doing this during the innumerable ages 
that must have preceded the present if the supposition of an infinite past is correct.] 
. . . We may as well imagine, [said Cleanthes] that all men would wear stockings for 
ten thousand years, and never have the sense to think of garters to tie them. All 
these seem convincing proofs of the youth, or rather infancy of the world; as being 
founded on the operation of principles more constant and steady than those by 
which human society is governed and directed. Nothing less than a total convulsion 
of the elements will ever destroy all the European animals and vegetables which are 
now to be found in the Western world. 

And what argument have you against such convulsions? replied Philo. Strong and 
almost incontestable proofs may be traced over the whole earth, that every part of 
this globe has continued for many ages entirely covered with water. And though 
order were supposed inseparable from matter, and inherent in it; yet may matter be 
susceptible of many and great revolutions, through the endless periods of eternal 
duration.  . . . And were I obliged to defend any particular system of this nature, 
which I never willingly should do, I esteem none more plausible than that which 
ascribes an eternal inherent principle of order to the world, though attended with 
great and continual revolutions and alterations. This at once solves all difficulties; 
and if the solution, by being so general, is not entirely complete and satisfactory, it 
is at least a theory that we must sooner or later have recourse to, whatever system 
we embrace. How could things have been as they are, were there not an original 
inherent principle of order somewhere, in thought or in matter? And it is very 
indifferent to which of these we give the preference. Chance has no place, on any 
hypothesis, skeptical or religious. Every thing is surely governed by steady, 
inviolable laws. And were the inmost essence of things laid open to us, we should 
then discover a scene, of which, at present, we can have no idea. Instead of admiring 
the order of natural beings, we should clearly see that it was absolutely impossible 
for them, in the smallest article, ever to admit of any other disposition. . . . 

[Demea objects:] But how can order spring from any thing which perceives not that 
order which it bestows? You need only look around you, replied Philo, to satisfy 
yourself with regard to this question. A tree bestows order and organization on that 
tree which springs from it, without knowing the order; an animal in the same 
manner on its offspring; a bird on its nest; and instances of this kind are even more 
frequent in the world than those of order, which arise from reason and contrivance. 
To say, that all this order in animals and vegetables proceeds ultimately from 
design, is begging the question; nor can that great point be ascertained otherwise 
than by proving, a priori, both that order is, from its nature, inseparably attached 
to thought; and that it can never of itself, or from original unknown principles, 
belong to matter. 

But further, Demea; this objection which you urge can never be made use of by 
Cleanthes, without renouncing a defence which he has already made against one of 
my objections. When I enquired concerning the cause of that supreme reason and 
intelligence into which he resolves every thing; he told me, that the impossibility of 
satisfying such enquiries could never be admitted as an objection in any species of 
philosophy. We must stop somewhere, says he; nor is it ever within the reach of 
human capacity to explain ultimate causes, or shew the last connections of any 
objects. It is sufficient, if any steps, so far as we go, are supported by experience and 
observation. Now, that vegetation and generation, as well as reason, are experienced 
to be principles of order in nature, is undeniable. If I rest my system of cosmogony 
on the former, preferably to the latter, it is at my choice. The matter seems entirely 
arbitrary. And when Cleanthes asks me what is the cause of my great vegetative or 
generative faculty, I am equally entitled to ask him the cause of his great reasoning 
principle. These questions we have agreed to forbear on both sides; and it is chiefly 
his interest on the present occasion to stick to this agreement. Judging by our 
limited and imperfect experience, generation has some privileges above reason: for 
we see every day the latter arise from the former, never the former from the latter. . 
. . 

And this very consideration too, continued Philo, which we have stumbled on in the 
course of the argument, suggests a new hypothesis of cosmogony, that is not 
absolutely absurd and improbable. Is there a system, an order, an economy of 
things, by which matter can preserve that perpetual agitation which seems essential 
to it, and yet maintain a constancy in the forms which it produces? There certainly 
is such an economy; for this is actually the case with the present world. The 
continual motion of matter, therefore, in less than infinite transpositions, must 
produce this economy or order; and by its very nature, that order, when once 
established, supports itself, for many ages, if not to eternity. But wherever matter is 
so poised, arranged, and adjusted, as to continue in perpetual motion, and yet 
preserve a constancy in the forms, its situation must, of necessity, have all the same 
appearance of art and contrivance which we observe at present. All the parts of 
each form must have a relation to each other, and to the whole; and the whole itself 
must have a relation to the other parts of the universe; to the element in which the 
form subsists; to the materials with which it repairs its waste and decay; and to 
every other form which is hostile or friendly. A defect in any of these particulars 
destroys the form; and the matter of which it is composed is again set loose, and is 

thrown into irregular motions and fermentations, till it unite itself to some other 
regular form. If no such form be prepared to receive it, and if there be a great 
quantity of this corrupted matter in the universe, the universe itself is entirely 
disordered; whether it be the feeble embryo of a world in its first beginnings that is 
thus destroyed, or the rotten carcase of one languishing in old age and infirmity. In 
either case, a chaos ensues; till finite, though innumerable revolutions produce at 
last some forms, whose parts and organs are so adjusted as to support the forms 
amidst a continued succession of matter. 

Suppose (for we shall endeavor to vary the expression), that matter were thrown 
into any position, by a blind, unguided force; it is evident that this first position 
must, in all probability, be the most confused and most disorderly imaginable, 
without any resemblance to those works of human contrivance, which, along with a 
symmetry of parts, discover an adjustment of means to ends, and a tendency to self-
preservation. If the actuating force cease after this operation, matter must remain 
for ever in disorder, and continue an immense chaos, without any proportion or 
activity. But suppose that the actuating force, whatever it be, still continues in 
matter, this first position will immediately give place to a second, which will likewise 
in all probability be as disorderly as the first, and so on through many successions of 
changes and revolutions. No particular order or position ever continues a moment 
unaltered. The original force, still remaining in activity, gives a perpetual 
restlessness to matter. Every possible situation is produced, and instantly destroyed. 
If a glimpse or dawn of order appears for a moment, it is instantly hurried away, 
and confounded, by that never-ceasing force which actuates every part of matter. 

Thus the universe goes on for many ages in a continued succession of chaos and 
disorder. But is it not possible that it may settle at last, so as not to lose its motion 
and active force (for that we have supposed inherent in it), yet so as to preserve an 
uniformity of appearance, amidst the continual motion and fluctuation of its parts? 
This we find to be the case with the universe at present. Every individual is 
perpetually changing, and every part of every individual; and yet the whole remains, 
in appearance, the same. May we not hope for such a position, or rather be assured 
of it, from the eternal revolutions of unguided matter; and may not this account for 
all the appearing wisdom and contrivance which is in the universe? Let us 
contemplate the subject a little, and we shall find, that this adjustment, if attained 
by matter of a seeming stability in the forms, with a real and perpetual revolution 
or motion of parts, affords a plausible, if not a true solution of the difficulty. 

It is in vain, therefore, to insist upon the uses of the parts in animals or vegetables, 
and their curious adjustment to each other. I would fain know, how an animal could 
subsist, unless its parts were so adjusted? Do we not find, that it immediately 
perishes whenever this adjustment ceases, and that its matter corrupting tries some 
new form? It happens indeed, that the parts of the world are so well adjusted, that 
some regular form immediately lays claim to this corrupted matter: and if it were 
not so, could the world subsist? Must it not dissolve as well as the animal, and pass 
through new positions and situations, till in great, but finite succession, it falls at 
last into the present or some such order? 

It is well, replied Cleanthes, you told us, that this hypothesis was suggested on a 
sudden, in the course of the argument. Had you had leisure to examine it, you 
would soon have perceived the insuperable objections to which it is exposed. No 
form, you say, can subsist, unless it possess those powers and organs requisite for its 
subsistence: some new order or economy must be tried, and so on, without 
intermission; till at last some order, which can support and maintain itself, is fallen 
upon. But according to this hypothesis, whence arise the many conveniences and 
advantages which men and all animals possess? Two eyes, two ears, are not 
absolutely necessary for the subsistence of the species. Human race might have been 
propagated and preserved, without horses, dogs, cows, sheep, and those innumerable 
fruits and products which serve to our satisfaction and enjoyment. If no camels had 
been created for the use of man in the sandy deserts of Africa and Arabia, would 
the world have been dissolved? If no loadstone had been framed to give that 
wonderful and useful direction to the needle, would human society and the human 
kind have been immediately extinguished? Though the maxims of Nature be in 
general very frugal, yet instances of this kind are far from being rare; and any one of 
them is a sufficient proof of design, and of a benevolent design, which gave rise to 
the order and arrangement of the universe. . . . 

PART IX 

[In this chapter, Demea is allowed to put his case for the a priori argument that God exists:] 

The argument, replied Demea, which I would insist on, is the common one. Whatever exists must have a 
cause or reason of its existence; it being absolutely impossible for any thing to produce itself, or be the 
cause of its own existence. In mounting up, therefore, from effects to causes, we must either go on in 
tracing an infinite succession, without any ultimate cause at all; or must at last have recourse to some 
ultimate cause, that is necessarily existent: now, that the first supposition is absurd, may be thus proved. In 
the infinite chain or succession of causes and effects, each single effect is determined to exist by the power 
and efficacy of that cause which immediately preceded; but the whole eternal chain or succession, taken 
together, is not determined or caused by any thing; and yet it is evident that it requires a cause or reason, as 
much as any particular object which begins to exist in time. The question is still reasonable, why this 
particular succession of causes existed from eternity, and not any other succession, or no succession at all. 
If there be no necessarily existent being, any supposition which can be formed is equally possible; nor is 
there any more absurdity in Nothing's having existed from eternity, than there is in that succession of 
causes which constitutes the universe. What was it, then, which determined Something to exist rather than 
Nothing, and bestowed being on a particular possibility, exclusive of the rest? External causes, there are 
supposed to be none. Chance is a word without a meaning. Was it Nothing? But that can never produce any 
thing. We must, therefore, have recourse to a necessarily existent Being, who carries the REASON of his 
existence in himself, and who cannot be supposed not to exist, without an express contradiction. There is, 
consequently, such a Being; that is, there is a Deity. 

I shall not leave it to Philo, said Cleanthes, though I know that the starting objections is his chief delight, to 
point out the weakness of this metaphysical reasoning. It seems to me so obviously ill-grounded, and at the 
same time of so little consequence to the cause of true piety and religion, that I shall myself venture to 
shew the fallacy of it. 

I shall begin with observing, that there is an evident absurdity in pretending to demonstrate a matter of fact, 
or to prove it by any arguments a priori. Nothing is demonstrable, unless the contrary implies a 

contradiction. Nothing that is distinctly conceivable, implies a contradiction. Whatever we conceive as 
existent, we can also conceive as non-existent. There is no being, therefore, whose non- existence implies a 
contradiction. Consequently there is no being, whose existence is demonstrable. I propose this argument as 
entirely decisive, and am willing to rest the whole controversy upon it. 

It is pretended that the Deity is a necessarily existent being; and this necessity of his existence is attempted 
to be explained by asserting, that if we knew his whole essence or nature, we should perceive it to be as 
impossible for him not to exist, as for twice two not to be four. But it is evident that this can never happen, 
while our faculties remain the same as at present. It will still be possible for us, at any time, to conceive the 
non-existence of what we formerly conceived to exist; nor can the mind ever lie under a necessity of 
supposing any object to remain always in being; in the same manner as we lie under a necessity of always 
conceiving twice two to be four. The words, therefore, necessary existence, have no meaning; or, which is 
the same thing, none that is consistent. 

But further, why may not the material universe be the necessarily existent being, according to this 
pretended explication of necessity? We dare not affirm that we know all the qualities of matter; and for 
aught we can determine, it may contain some qualities, which, were they known, would make its non- 
existence appear as great a contradiction as that twice two is five. I find only one argument employed to 
prove, that the material world is not the necessarily existent Being: and this argument is derived from the 
contingency both of the matter and the form of the world. "Any particle of matter," it is said, 7 "may be 
conceived to be annihilated; and any form may be conceived to be altered. Such an annihilation or 
alteration, therefore, is not impossible." But it seems a great partiality not to perceive, that the same 
argument extends equally to the Deity, so far as we have any conception of him; and that the mind can at 
least imagine him to be non-existent, or his attributes to be altered. It must be some unknown, 
inconceivable qualities, which can make his non-existence appear impossible, or his attributes unalterable: 
and no reason can be assigned, why these qualities may not belong to matter. As they are altogether 
unknown and inconceivable, they can never be proved incompatible with it. 

Add to this, that in tracing an eternal succession of objects, it seems absurd to enquire for a general cause 
or first author. How can any thing, that exists from eternity, have a cause, since that relation implies a 
priority in time, and a beginning of existence? 

In such a chain, too, or succession of objects, each part is caused by that which preceded it, and causes that 
which succeeds it. Where then is the difficulty? But the WHOLE, you say, wants a cause. I answer, that the 
uniting of these parts into a whole, like the uniting of several distinct countries into one kingdom, or 
several distinct members into one body, is performed merely by an arbitrary act of the mind, and has no 
influence on the nature of things. Did I shew you the particular causes of each individual in a collection of 
twenty particles of matter, I should think it very unreasonable, should you afterwards ask me, what was the 
cause of the whole twenty. This is sufficiently explained in explaining the cause of the parts. 

From Part X 

[Because Demea wants to maintain traditional Christian ideas, he objects to the idea 
of a benevolent design currently visible.  He argues for the fallen state of nature and 
the curse  upon the earth that came with the first disobedience in the Garden of 
Eden.] The whole earth, believe me, Philo, said Demea, is cursed and polluted. A 
perpetual war is kindled amongst all living creatures. Necessity, hunger, want, 
stimulate the strong and courageous: fear, anxiety, terror, agitate the weak and 
infirm. The first entrance into life gives anguish to the new-born infant and to its 

wretched parent: weakness, impotence, distress, attend each stage of that life: and it 
is at last finished in agony and horror. 

Observe too, says Philo, the curious artifices of Nature, in order to embitter the life 
of every living being. The stronger prey upon the weaker, and keep them in 
perpetual terror and anxiety. The weaker too, in their turn, often prey upon the 
stronger, and vex and molest them without relaxation. Consider that innumerable 
race of insects, which either are bred on the body of each animal, or, flying about, 
infix their stings in him. These insects have others still less than themselves, which 
torment them. And thus on each hand, before and behind, above and below, every 
animal is surrounded with enemies, which incessantly seek his misery and 
destruction. 

And why should man, added Demea, pretend to an exemption from the lot of all 
other animals?  Only consider those woes which  arise within ourselves, from the 
distempered condition of our mind and body. How many lie under the lingering 
torment of  diseases? And the disorders of the mind, though more secret, are not 
perhaps less dismal and vexatious. Remorse, shame, anguish, rage, disappointment, 
anxiety, fear, dejection, despair; who has ever passed through life without cruel 
inroads from these tormentors? How many have scarcely ever felt any better 
sensations? Labor and poverty, so abhorred by every one, are the certain lot of the 
far greater number; and those few privileged persons, who enjoy ease and opulence, 
never reach contentment or true felicity. All the goods of life united would not make 
a very happy man; but all the ills united would make a wretch indeed; and any one 
of them almost (and who can be free from every one?) nay often the absence of one 
good (and who can possess all?) is sufficient to render life ineligible. 

Were a stranger to drop on a sudden into this world, I would shew him, as a 
specimen of its ills, an hospital full of diseases, a prison crowded with malefactors 
and debtors, a field of battle strewed with carcases, a fleet foundering in the ocean, 
a nation languishing under tyranny, famine, or pestilence. To turn the gay side of 
life to him and give him a notion of its pleasures; whither should I conduct him? to 
a ball, to an opera, to court? He might justly think, that I was only showing him a 
diversity of distress and sorrow. . . . 

And is it possible, Cleanthes, said Philo, that after all these reflections, and 
infinitely more, which might be suggested, you can still persevere in your 
Anthropomorphism, and assert the moral attributes of the Deity, his justice, 
benevolence, mercy, and rectitude, to be of the same nature with these virtues in 
human creatures? His power we allow is infinite: whatever he wills is executed: but 
neither man nor any other animal is happy: therefore he does not will their 
happiness. His wisdom is infinite: he is never mistaken in choosing the means to any 
end: but the course of Nature tends not to human or animal felicity: therefore it is 
not established for that purpose. Through the whole compass of human knowledge, 
there are no inferences more certain and infallible than these. In what respect, then, 
do his benevolence and mercy resemble the benevolence and mercy of men? 
Epicurus's old questions are yet unanswered.  Is God willing to prevent evil, but not 

able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? then is he malevolent. Is he 
both able and willing? whence then is evil? 

You ascribe, Cleanthes (and I believe justly), a purpose and intention to Nature. 
But what, I beseech you, is the object of that curious artifice and machinery, which 
she has displayed in all animals? The preservation alone of individuals, and 
propagation of the species. It seems enough for her purpose, if such a rank be barely 
upheld in the universe, without any care or concern for the happiness of the 
members that compose it. No resource for this purpose: no machinery, in order 
merely to give pleasure or ease: no fund of pure joy and contentment: no indulgence, 
without some want or necessity accompanying it. At least, the few phenomena of 
this nature are overbalanced by opposite phenomena of still greater importance. . . . 
How then does the Divine benevolence display itself, in the sense of you 
Anthropomorphites? None but we Mystics, as you were pleased to call us, can 
account for this strange mixture of phenomena, by deriving it from attributes, 
infinitely perfect, but incomprehensible. 

And have you at last, said Cleanthes, smiling, betrayed your intentions, Philo? Your 
long agreement with Demea did indeed a little surprise me; but I find you were all 
the while erecting a concealed battery against me. And I must confess, that you 
have now fallen upon a subject worthy of your noble spirit of opposition and 
controversy. If you can make out the present point, and prove mankind to be 
unhappy or corrupted, there is an end at once of all religion. For to what purpose 
establish the natural attributes of the Deity, while the moral are still doubtful and 
uncertain? 

You take umbrage very easily, replied Demea, at opinions the most innocent, and 
the most generally received, even amongst the religious and devout themselves: and 
nothing can be more surprising than to find a topic like this, concerning the 
wickedness and misery of man, charged with no less than Atheism and profaneness. 
Have not all pious divines and preachers, who have indulged their rhetoric on so 
fertile a subject; have they not easily, I say, given a solution of any difficulties which 
may attend it? This world is but a point in comparison of the universe; this life but 
a moment in comparison of eternity. The present evil phenomena, therefore, are 
rectified in other regions, and in some future period of existence. And the eyes of 
men, being then opened to larger views of things, see the whole connexion of general 
laws; and trace with adoration, the benevolence and rectitude of the Deity, through 
all the mazes and intricacies of his providence. 

No! replied Cleanthes, No! These arbitrary suppositions can never be admitted, 
contrary to matter of fact, visible and uncontroverted. Whence can any cause be 
known but from its known effects? Whence can any hypothesis be proved but from 
the apparent phenomena? To establish one hypothesis upon another, is building 
entirely in the air; and the utmost we ever attain, by these conjectures and fictions, 
is to ascertain the bare possibility of our opinion; but never can we, upon such 
terms, establish its reality. 

The only method of supporting Divine benevolence, and it is what I willingly 
embrace, is to deny absolutely the misery and wickedness of man. Your 
representations are exaggerated; your melancholy views mostly fictitious; your 
inferences contrary to fact and experience. Health is more common than sickness; 
pleasure than pain; happiness than misery. And for one vexation which we meet 
with, we attain, upon computation, a hundred enjoyments. 

. . . not to insist upon these topics, continued Philo, though most obvious, certain, 
and important; I must use the freedom to admonish you, Cleanthes, that you have 
put the controversy upon a most dangerous issue, and are unawares introducing a 
total scepticism into the most essential articles of natural and revealed theology. 
What! no method of fixing a just foundation for religion, unless we allow the 
happiness of human life, and maintain a continued existence even in this world, with 
all our present pains, infirmities, vexations, and follies, to be eligible and desirable! 
But this is contrary to every one's feeling and experience: it is contrary to an 
authority so established as nothing can subvert. No decisive proofs can ever be 
produced against this authority; nor is it possible for you to compute, estimate, and 
compare, all the pains and all the pleasures in the lives of all men and of all animals: 
and thus, by your resting the whole system of religion on a point, which, from its 
very nature, must for ever be uncertain, you tacitly confess, that that system is 
equally uncertain. 

But allowing you what never will be believed, at least what you never possibly can 
prove, that animal, or at least human happiness, in this life, exceeds its misery, you 
have yet done nothing: for this is not, by any means, what we expect from infinite 
power, infinite wisdom, and infinite goodness. Why is there any misery at all in the 
world? Not by chance surely. From some cause then. Is it from the intention of the 
Deity? But he is perfectly benevolent. Is it contrary to his intention? But he is 
almighty. Nothing can shake the solidity of this reasoning, so short, so clear, so 
decisive; except we assert, that these subjects exceed all human capacity, and that 
our common measures of truth and falsehood are not applicable to them; a topic 
which I have all along insisted on, but which you have, from the beginning, rejected 
with scorn and indignation. . . . 

Here, Cleanthes, I find myself at ease in my argument. Here I triumph. Formerly, 
when we argued concerning the natural attributes of intelligence and design, I 
needed all my sceptical and metaphysical subtilty to elude your grasp. In many 
views of the universe and of its parts, particularly the latter, the beauty and fitness 
of final causes strike us with such irresistible force, that all objections appear (what 
I believe they really are) mere cavils and sophisms; nor can we then imagine how it 
was ever possible for us to repose any weight on them. But there is no view of 
human life, or of the condition of mankind, from which, without the greatest 
violence, we can infer the moral attributes, or learn that infinite benevolence, 
conjoined with infinite power and infinite wisdom, which we must discover by the 
eyes of faith alone. It is your turn now to tug the laboring oar, and to support your 
philosophical subtilties against the dictates of plain reason and experience. 

From Part XI 

I scruple not to allow, said Cleanthes, that I have been apt to suspect the frequent 
repetition of the word infinite, which we meet with in all theological writers, to 
savor more of panegyric than of philosophy; and that any purposes of reasoning, and 
even of religion, would be better served, were we to rest contented with more 
accurate and more moderate expressions. The terms admirable,excellent, 
superlatively great,wise, and holy; these sufficiently fill the imaginations of men; 
and any thing beyond, besides that it leads into absurdities, has no influence on the 
affections or sentiments. Thus, in the present subject, if we abandon all human 
analogy, as seems your intention, Demea, I am afraid we abandon all religion, and 
retain no conception of the great object of our adoration. If we preserve human 
analogy, we must for ever find it impossible to reconcile any mixture of evil in the 
universe with infinite attributes; much less can we ever prove the latter from the 
former. But supposing the Author of Nature to be finitely perfect, though far 
exceeding mankind, a satisfactory account may then be given of natural and moral 
evil, and every untoward phenomenon be explained and adjusted. A less evil may 
then be chosen, in order to avoid a greater; inconveniences be submitted to, in order 
to reach a desirable end; and in a word, benevolence, regulated by wisdom, and 
limited by necessity, may produce just such a world as the present. You, Philo, who 
are so prompt at starting views, and reflections, and analogies, I would gladly hear, 
at length, without interruption, your opinion of this new theory; and if it deserve 
our attention, we may afterwards, at more leisure, reduce it into form. 

My sentiments, replied Philo, are not worth being made a mystery of; and therefore, 
without any ceremony, I shall deliver what occurs to me with regard to the present 
subject. It must, I think, be allowed, that if a very limited intelligence, whom we 
shall suppose utterly unacquainted with the universe, were assured, that it were the 
production of a very good, wise, and powerful Being, however finite, he would, from 
his conjectures, form beforehanda different notion of it from what we find it to be 
by experience; nor would he ever imagine, merely from these attributes of the cause, 
of which he is informed, that the effect could be so full of vice and misery and 
disorder, as it appears in this life. Supposing now, that this person were brought 
into the world, still assured that it was the workmanship of such a sublime and 
benevolent Being; he might, perhaps, be surprized at the disappointment; but would 
never retract his former belief, if founded on any very solid argument; since such a 
limited intelligence must be sensible of his own blindness and ignorance, and must 
allow, that there may be many solutions of those phenomena, which will for ever 
escape his comprehension. But supposing, which is the real case with regard to man, 
that this creature is not antecedently convinced of a supreme intelligence, 
benevolent and powerful, but is left to gather such a belief from the appearances of 
things; this entirely alters the case, nor will he ever find any reason for such a 
conclusion. . . . 

Did I show you a house or palace, where there was not one apartment convenient or 
agreeable; where the windows, doors, fires, passages, stairs, and the whole economy 
of the building, were the source of noise, confusion, fatigue, darkness, and the 
extremes of heat and cold; you would certainly blame the contrivance, without any 

further examination. The architect would in vain display his subtlety, and prove to 
you, that if this door or that window were altered, greater ills would ensue. What he 
says may be strictly true: the alteration of one particular, while the other parts of 
the building remain, may only augment the inconveniences. But still you would 
assert in general, that, if the architect had had skill and good intentions, he might 
have formed such a plan of the whole, and might have adjusted the parts in such a 
manner, as would have remedied all or most of these inconveniences. His ignorance, 
or even your own ignorance of such a plan, will never convince you of the 
impossibility of it. If you find any inconveniences and deformities in the building, 
you will always, without entering into any detail, condemn the architect. In short, I 
repeat the question: Is the world, considered in general, and as it appears to us in 
this life, different from what a man, or such a limited being, would, beforehand, 
expect from a very powerful, wise, and benevolent Deity? 

. . . There seems to be four circumstances, on which depend all, or the greatest part 
of the ills, that molest sensible creatures. . . . None of them appear to human reason 
in the least degree necessary or unavoidable; nor can we suppose them such, without 
the utmost license of imagination. 

The FIRST circumstance which introduces evil, is that contrivance or economy of 
the animal creation, by which pains, as well as pleasures, are employed to excite all 
creatures to action, and make them vigilant in the great work of self-preservation. 
Now pleasure alone, in its various degrees, seems to human understanding sufficient 
for this purpose. . . . Men pursue pleasure as eagerly as they avoid pain; at least 
they might have been so constituted. It seems, therefore, plainly possible to carry on 
the business of life without any pain. Why then is any animal ever rendered 
susceptible of such a sensation? . . . But a capacity of pain would not alone produce 
pain, were it not for the SECOND circumstance, viz. the conducting of the world by 
general laws; and this seems nowise necessary to a very perfect Being. It is true, if 
every thing were conducted by particular volitions, the course of nature would be 
perpetually broken, and no man could employ his reason in the conduct of life. But 
might not other particular volitions remedy this inconvenience? In short, might not 
the Deity exterminate all ill, wherever it were to be found; and produce all good, 
without any preparation, or long progress of causes and effects? . . . 

If every thing in the universe be conducted by general laws, and if animals be 
rendered susceptible of pain, it scarcely seems possible but some ill must arise in the 
various shocks of matter, and the various concurrence and opposition of general 
laws; but this ill would be very rare, were it not for the THIRD circumstance, which 
I proposed to mention, viz. the great frugality with which all powers and faculties 
are distributed to every particular being. So well adjusted are the organs and 
capacities of all animals, and so well fitted to their preservation, that, as far as 
history or tradition reaches, there appears not to be any single species which has yet 
been extinguished in the universe. Every animal has the requisite endowments; but 
these endowments are bestowed with so scrupulous an economy, that any 
considerable diminution must entirely destroy the creature. Wherever one power is 
increased, there is a proportional abatement in the others. Animals which excel in 
swiftness are commonly defective in force. Those which possess both are either 

imperfect in some of their senses, or are oppressed with the most craving wants. The 
human species, whose chief excellency is reason and sagacity, is of all others the 
most necessitous, and the most deficient in bodily advantages; without clothes, 
without arms, without food, without lodging, without any convenience of life, except 
what they owe to their own skill and industry. In short, nature seems to have 
formed an exact calculation of the necessities of her creatures; and, like a rigid 
master, has afforded them little more powers or endowments than what are strictly 
sufficient to supply those necessities. An indulgent parent would have bestowed a 
large stock, in order to guard against accidents, and secure the happiness and 
welfare of the creature in the most unfortunate concurrence of circumstances. Every 
course of life would not have been so surrounded with precipices, that the least 
departure from the true path, by mistake or necessity, must involve us in misery 
and ruin. Some reserve, some fund, would have been provided to insure happiness; 
nor would the powers and the necessities have been adjusted with so rigid an 
economy. The Author of Nature is inconceivably powerful: his force is supposed 
great, if not altogether inexhaustible: nor is there any reason, as far as we can judge, 
to make him observe this strict frugality in his dealings with his creatures. It would 
have been better, were his power extremely limited, to have created fewer animals, 
and to have endowed these with more faculties for their happiness and preservation. 
A builder is never esteemed prudent, who undertakes a plan beyond what his stock 
will enable him to finish. . . . 

The FOURTH circumstance, whence arises the misery and ill of the universe, is the 
inaccurate workmanship of all the springs and principles of the great machine of 
nature. It must be acknowledged, that there are few parts of the universe, which 
seem not to serve some purpose, and whose removal would not produce a visible 
defect and disorder in the whole. The parts hang all together; nor can one be 
touched without affecting the rest, in a greater or less degree. But at the same time, 
it must be observed, that none of these parts or principles, however useful, are so 
accurately adjusted, as to keep precisely within those bounds in which their utility 
consists; but they are, all of them, apt, on every occasion, to run into the one 
extreme or the other. One would imagine, that this grand production had not 
received the last hand of the maker; so little finished is every part, and so coarse are 
the strokes with which it is executed. Thus, the winds are requisite to convey the 
vapours along the surface of the globe, and to assist men in navigation: but how oft, 
rising up to tempests and hurricanes, do they become pernicious? Rains are 
necessary to nourish all the plants and animals of the earth: but how often are they 
defective? how often excessive? Heat is requisite to all life and vegetation; but is not 
always found in the due proportion. On the mixture and secretion of the humours 
and juices of the body depend the health and prosperity of the animal: but the parts 
perform not regularly their proper function. What more useful than all the passions 
of the mind, ambition, vanity, love, anger? But how oft do they break their bounds, 
and cause the greatest convulsions in society? There is nothing so advantageous in 
the universe, but what frequently becomes pernicious, by its excess or defect; nor 
has Nature guarded, with the requisite accuracy, against all disorder or confusion. 
The irregularity is never perhaps so great as to destroy any species; but is often 
sufficient to involve the individuals in ruin and misery. 

On the concurrence, then, of these four circumstances, does all or the greatest part 
of natural evil depend. . . . Look round this universe. What an immense profusion of 
beings, animated and organized, sensible and active! You admire this prodigious 
variety and fecundity. But inspect a little more narrowly these living existences, the 
only beings worth regarding. How hostile and destructive to each other! How 
insufficient all of them for their own happiness! How contemptible or odious to the 
spectator! The whole presents nothing but the idea of a blind Nature, impregnated 
by a great vivifying principle, and pouring forth from her lap, without discernment 
or parental care, her maimed and abortive children! 

Here the Manichaean system occurs as a proper hypothesis to solve the difficulty: 
and no doubt, in some respects, it is very specious, and has more probability than 
the common hypothesis, by giving a plausible account of the strange mixture of 
good and ill which appears in life. But if we consider, on the other hand, the perfect 
uniformity and agreement of the parts of the universe, we shall not discover in it 
any marks of the combat of a malevolent with a benevolent being. There is indeed 
an opposition of pains and pleasures in the feelings of sensible creatures: but are not 
all the operations of Nature carried on by an opposition of principles, of hot and 
cold, moist and dry, light and heavy? The true conclusion is, that the original 
Source of all things is entirely indifferent to all these principles; and has no more 
regard to good above ill, than to heat above cold, or to drought above moisture, or 
to light above heavy. . . . 

Thus Philo continued to the last his spirit of opposition, and his censure of 
established opinions. But I could observe that Demea did not at all relish the latter 
part of the discourse; and he took occasion soon after, on some pretence or other, to 
leave the company. 

PART XII. 

After Demea's departure, Cleanthes and Philo continued the conversation in the 
following manner. Our friend, I am afraid, said Cleanthes, will have little inclination 
to revive this topic of discourse, while you are in company . . . 

I must confess, replied Philo, that I am less cautious on the subject of Natural 
Religion than on any other; both because I know that I can never, on that head, 
corrupt the principles of any man of common sense; and because no one, I am 
confident, in whose eyes I appear a man of common sense, will ever mistake my 
intentions. You, in particular, Cleanthes, with whom I live in unreserved intimacy; 
you are sensible, that notwithstanding the freedom of my conversation, and my love 
of singular arguments, no one has a deeper sense of religion impressed on his mind, 
or pays more profound adoration to the Divine Being, as he discovers himself to 
reason, in the inexplicable contrivance and artifice of nature. A purpose, an 
intention, a design, strikes every where the most careless, the most stupid thinker; 
and no man can be so hardened in absurd systems, as at all times to reject it. That 
Nature does nothing in vain, is a maxim established in all the schools, merely from 
the contemplation of the works of Nature, without any religious purpose; and, from 
a firm conviction of its truth, an anatomist, who had observed a new organ or canal, 

would never be satisfied till he had also discovered its use and intention. One great 
foundation of the Copernican system is the maxim, That Nature acts by the 
simplest methods, and chooses the most proper means to any end; and astronomers 
often, without thinking of it, lay this strong foundation of piety and religion. The 
same thing is observable in other parts of philosophy: and thus all the sciences 
almost lead us insensibly to acknowledge a first intelligent Author; and their 
authority is often so much the greater, as they do not directly profess that 
intention. 

It is with pleasure I hear Galen reason concerning the structure of the human body. 
The anatomy of a man, says he, discovers above six hundred different muscles; and 
whoever duly considers these, will find, that, in each of them, Nature must have 
adjusted at least ten different circumstances, in order to attain the end which she 
proposed; proper figure, just magnitude, right disposition of the several ends, upper 
and lower position of the whole, the due insertion of the several nerves, veins, and 
arteries: so that, in the muscles alone, above six thousand several views and 
intentions must have been formed and executed. The bones he calculates to be two 
hundred and eighty-four: the distinct purposes aimed at in the structure of each, 
above forty. What a prodigious display of artifice, even in these simple and 
homogeneous parts! But if we consider the skin, ligaments, vessels, glandules, 
humours, the several limbs and members of the body; how must our astonishment 
rise upon us, in proportion to the number and intricacy of the parts so artificially 
adjusted! The further we advance in these researches, we discover new scenes of art 
and wisdom: but descry still, at a distance, further scenes beyond our reach; in the 
fine internal structure of the parts, in the economy of the brain, in the fabric of the 
seminal vessels. All these artifices are repeated in every different species of animal, 
with wonderful variety, and with exact propriety, suited to the different intentions 
of Nature in framing each species. And if the infidelity of Galen, even when these 
natural sciences were still imperfect, could not withstand such striking appearances, 
to what pitch of pertinacious obstinacy must a philosopher in this age have attained, 
who can now doubt of a Supreme Intelligence! 

Could I meet with one of this species (who, I thank God, are very rare), I would ask 
him: Supposing there were a God, who did not discover himself immediately to our 
senses, were it possible for him to give stronger proofs of his existence, than what 
appear on the whole face of Nature? What indeed could such a Divine Being do, but 
copy the present economy of things; render many of his artifices so plain, that no 
stupidity could mistake them; afford glimpses of still greater artifices, which 
demonstrate his prodigious superiority above our narrow apprehensions; and conceal 
altogether a great many from such imperfect creatures? . . . 

I shall further add, said Cleanthes, to what you have so well urged, that one great 
advantage of the principle of Theism, is, that it is the only system of cosmogony 
which can be rendered intelligible and complete, and yet can throughout preserve a 
strong analogy to what we every day see and experience in the world. The 
comparison of the universe to a machine of human contrivance, is so obvious and 
natural, and is justified by so many instances of order and design in Nature, that it 
must immediately strike all unprejudiced apprehensions, and procure universal 

approbation. Whoever attempts to weaken this theory, cannot pretend to succeed 
by establishing in its place any other that is precise and determinate: it is sufficient 
for him if he start doubts and difficulties; and by remote and abstract views of 
things, reach that suspense of judgment, which is here the utmost boundary of his 
wishes. . . . 

So little, replied Philo, do I esteem this suspense of judgment in the present case to 
be possible, that I am apt to suspect there enters somewhat of a dispute of words 
into this controversy, more than is usually imagined. That the works of Nature bear 
a great analogy to the productions of art, is evident; and according to all the rules of 
good reasoning, we ought to infer, if we argue at all concerning them, that their 
causes have a proportional analogy. But as there are also considerable differences, 
we have reason to suppose a proportional difference in the causes; and in particular, 
ought to attribute a much higher degree of power and energy to the supreme cause, 
than any we have ever observed in mankind. Here then the existence of a Deity is 
plainly ascertained by reason: and if we make it a question, whether, on account of 
these analogies, we can properly call him a mindor intelligence, notwithstanding the 
vast difference which may reasonably be supposed between him and human minds; 
what is this but a mere verbal controversy? . . . 

All men of sound reason are disgusted with verbal disputes, which abound so much 
in philosophical and theological enquiries; and it is found, that the only remedy for 
this abuse, must arise from clear definitions, from the precision of those ideas which 
enter into any argument, and from the strict and uniform use of those terms which 
are employed. But there is a species of controversy, which, from the very nature of 
language and of human ideas, is involved in perpetual ambiguity, and can never, by 
any precaution or any definitions, be able to reach a reasonable certainty or 
precision. These are the controversies concerning the degrees of any quality or 
circumstance. Men may argue to all eternity, whether Hannibal be a great, or a very 
great, or a superlatively great man, what degree of beauty Cleopatra possessed, 
what epithet of praise Livy or Thucydides is entitled to, without bringing the 
controversy to any determination. . . . That the dispute concerning Theism is of this 
nature, and consequently is merely verbal, or perhaps, if possible, still more 
incurably ambiguous, will appear upon the slightest enquiry. I ask the Theist, if he 
does not allow that there is a great and immeasurable, because incomprehensible 
difference between the human and the divine mind: the more pious he is, the more 
readily will he assent to the affirmative, and the more will he be disposed to magnify 
the difference: he will even assert, that the difference is of a nature which cannot be 
too much magnified. I next turn to the Atheist, who, I assert, is only nominally so, 
and can never possibly be in earnest; and I ask him, whether, from the coherence 
and apparent sympathy in all the parts of this world, there be not a certain degree 
of analogy among all the operations of Nature, in every situation and in every age; 
whether the rotting of a turnip, the generation of an animal, and the structure of 
human thought, be not energies that probably bear some remote analogy to each 
other: it is impossible he can deny it: he will readily acknowledge it. Having 
obtained this concession, I push him still further in his retreat; and I ask him, if it 
be not probable, that the principle which first arranged, and still maintains order in 
this universe, bears not also some remote inconceivable analogy to the other 

operations of nature, and, among the rest, to the economy of human mind and 
thought. However reluctant, he must give his assent. Where then, cry I to both 
these antagonists, is the subject of your dispute? The Theist allows, that the original 
intelligence is very different from human reason: the Atheist allows, that the 
original principle of order bears some remote analogy to it. Will you quarrel, 
gentlemen, about the degrees, and enter into a controversy, which admits not of any 
precise meaning, nor consequently of any determination? If you should be so 
obstinate, I should not be surprized to find you insensibly change sides; while the 
Theist, on the one hand, exaggerates the dissimilarity between the Supreme Being, 
and frail, imperfect, variable, fleeting, and mortal creatures; and the Atheist, on the 
other, magnifies the analogy among all the operations of Nature, in every period, 
every situation, and every position. Consider then, where the real point of 
controversy lies; and if you cannot lay aside your disputes, endeavor, at least, to 
cure yourselves of your animosity. 

And here I must also acknowledge, Cleanthes, that as the works of Nature have a 
much greater analogy to the effects of our art and contrivance, than to those of our 
benevolence and justice, we have reason to infer, that the natural attributes of the 
Deity have a greater resemblance to those of men, than his moral have to human 
virtues. But what is the consequence? Nothing but this, that the moral qualities of 
man are more defective in their kind than his natural abilities. For, as the Supreme 
Being is allowed to be absolutely and entirely perfect, whatever differs most from 
him, departs the furthest from the supreme standard of rectitude and perfection. 

These, Cleanthes, are my unfeigned sentiments on this subject; and these 
sentiments, you know, I have ever cherished and maintained. But in proportion to 
my veneration for true religion, is my abhorrence of vulgar superstitions; and I 
indulge a peculiar pleasure, I confess, in pushing such principles, sometimes into 
absurdity, sometimes into impiety. And you are sensible, that all bigots, 
notwithstanding their great aversion to the latter above the former, are commonly 
equally guilty of both. 

My inclination, replied Cleanthes, lies, I own, a contrary way. Religion, however 
corrupted, is still better than no religion at all. The doctrine of a future state is so 
strong and necessary a security to morals, that we never ought to abandon or 
neglect it. For if finite and temporary rewards and punishments have so great an 
effect, as we daily find; how much greater must be expected from such as are 
infinite and eternal? 

[How happens it then, said Philo, if vulgar superstition be so salutary to society, that all history abounds so 
much with accounts of its pernicious consequences on public affairs? Factions, civil wars, persecutions, 
subversions of government, oppression, slavery; these are the dismal consequences which always attend its 
prevalency over the minds of men. If the religious spirit be ever mentioned in any historical narration, we 
are sure to meet afterwards with a detail of the miseries which attend it. And no period of time can be 
happier or more prosperous, than those in which it is never regarded or heard of. 

The reason of this observation, replied Cleanthes, is obvious. The proper office of religion is to regulate the 
heart of men, humanize their conduct, infuse the spirit of temperance, order, and obedience; and as its 
operation is silent, and only enforces the motives of morality and justice, it is in danger of being 

overlooked and confounded with these other motives. When it distinguishes itself and acts as a separate 
principle over men, it has departed from its proper sphere, and has become only a cover to faction and 
ambition. 

And so will all religion, said Philo, except the philosophical and rational kind. Your reasonings are more 
easily eluded than my facts. The inference is not just, because finite and temporary rewards and 
punishments have so great influence, that therefore such as are infinite and eternal must have so much 
greater. Consider, I beseech you, the attachment which we have to present things, and the little concern 
which we discover for objects so remote and uncertain. . . . It is certain, from experience, that the smallest 
grain of natural honesty and benevolence has more effect on men's conduct, than the most pompous views 
suggested by theological theories and systems. . . . This is well understood in the world; and none but fools 
ever repose less trust in a man, because they hear, that from study and philosophy, he has entertained some 
speculative doubts with regard to theological subjects. And when we have to do with a man, who makes a 
great profession of religion and devotion, has this any other effect upon several, who pass for prudent, than 
to put them on their guard, lest they be cheated and deceived by him? 

We must further consider, that philosophers, who cultivate reason and reflection, stand less in need of such 
motives to keep them under the restraint of morals; and that the vulgar, who alone may need them, are 
utterly incapable of so pure a religion as represents the Deity to be pleased with nothing but virtue in 
human behavior. . . . [E]ven though superstition or enthusiasm should not put itself in direct opposition to 
morality, the very diverting of the attention, the raising up a new and frivolous species of merit, the 
preposterous distribution which it makes of praise and blame, must have the most pernicious 
consequences, and weaken extremely men's attachment to the natural motives of justice and humanity. . . .]

Take care, Philo, [replied Cleanthes, take care;] push not matters too far: allow not 
your zeal against false religion to undermine your veneration for the true. Forfeit 
not this principle, the chief, the only great comfort in life; and our principal support 
amidst all the attacks of adverse fortune. The most agreeable reflection, which it is 
possible for human imagination to suggest, is that of genuine Theism, which 
represents us as the workmanship of a Being perfectly good, wise, and powerful; who 
created us for happiness; and who, having implanted in us immeasurable desires of 
good, will prolong our existence to all eternity, and will transfer us into an infinite 
variety of scenes, in order to satisfy those desires, and render our felicity complete 
and durable. Next to such a Being himself (if the comparison be allowed), the 
happiest lot which we can imagine, is that of being under his guardianship and 
protection.
