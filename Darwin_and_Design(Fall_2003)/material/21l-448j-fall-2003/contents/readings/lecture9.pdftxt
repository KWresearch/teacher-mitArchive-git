FUTURE 
IMPROVEMENT OF SOCIETY WITH REMARKS ON THE SPECULATIONS 
OF MR. 
GODWIN, M. CONDORCET, AND OTHER WRITERS.  (1798) 

CHAPTER 1 
Question stated - Little prospect of a determinationof it, from the enmity of the 
opposing parties - The principal argument against the perfectibility of man and of 
society has never been fairly answered - Nature of the difficulty arising from 
population - Outline of the principal argument of the Essay 

THE great and unlooked for discoveries that have taken place of late years in 
natural philosophy, the increasing diffusion of general knowledge from the extension 
of the art of printing, the ardent and unshackled spirit of inquiry that prevails 
throughout the lettered and even unlettered world, the new and extraordinary lights 
that have been thrown on political subjects which dazzle and astonish the 
understanding, and particularly that tremendous phenomenon in the political 
horizon, the French Revolution, which, like a blazing comet, seems destined either 
to inspire with fresh life and vigour, or to scorch up and destroy the shrinking 
inhabitants of the earth, have all concurred to lead many able men into the opinion 
that we were touching on a period big with the most important changes, changes 
that would in some measure be decisive of the future fate of mankind. 
It has been said that the great question is now at issue, whether man shall 
henceforth start forwards with accelerated velocity towards illimitable, and hitherto 
unconceived improvement, or be condemned to a perpetual oscillation between 
happiness and misery, and after every effort remain still at an immeasurable 
distance from the wished-for goal. 
Yet, anxiously as every friend of mankind must look forwards to the 
termination of this painful suspense, and eagerly as the inquiring mind would hail 
every ray of light that might assist its view into futurity, it is much to be lamented 
that the writers on each side of this momentous question still keep far aloof from 
each other. Their mutual arguments do not meet with a candid examination. The 
question is not brought to rest on fewer points, and even in theory scarcely seems to 
be approaching to a decision. 
The advocate for the present order of things is apt to treat the sect of 
speculative philosophers either as a set of artful and designing knaves who preach up 
ardent benevolence and draw captivating pictures of a happier state of society only 
the better to enable them to destroy the present establishments and to forward 
their own deep-laid schemes of ambition, or as wild and mad-headed enthusiasts 
whose silly speculations and absurd paradoxes are not worthy the attention of any 
reasonable man. 
The advocate for the perfectibility of man, and of society, retorts on the 
defender of establishments a more than equal contempt. He brands him as the slave 

of the most miserable and narrow prejudices; or as the defender of the abuses. of 
civil society only because he profits by them. He paints him either as a character 
who prostitutes his understanding to his interest, or as one whose powers of mind 
are not of a size to grasp any thing great and noble, who cannot see above five yards 
before him, and who must therefore be utterly unable to take in the views of the 
enlightened benefactor of mankind. 
In this unamicable contest the cause of truth cannot but suffer. The really 
good arguments on each side of the question are not allowed to have their proper 
weight. Each pursues his own theory, little solicitous to correct or improve it by an 
attention to what is advanced by his opponents. 
The friend of the present order of things condemns all political speculations in 
the gross. He will not even condescend to examine the grounds from which the 
perfectibility of society is inferred. Much less will he give himself the trouble in a 
fair and candid manner to attempt an exposition of their fallacy. 
The speculative philosopher equally offends against the cause of truth. With 
eyes fixed on a happier state of society, the blessings of which he paints in the most 
captivating colours, he allows himself to indulge in the most bitter invectives against 
every present establishment, without applying his talents to consider the best and 
safest means of removing abuses and without seeming to be aware of the 
tremendous obstacles that threaten, even in theory, to oppose the progress of man 
towards perfection. 
It is an acknowledged truth in philosophy that a just theory will always be 
confirmed by experiment. Yet so much friction, and so many minute circumstances 
occur in practice, which it is next to impossible for the most enlarged and 
penetrating mind to foresee, that on few subjects can any theory be pronounced 
just, till all the arguments against it have been maturely weighed and clearly and 
consistently refuted. 
I have read some of the speculations on the perfectibility of man and of 
society with great pleasure. I have been warmed and delighted with the enchanting 
picture which they hold forth. I ardently wish for such happy improvements. But I 
see great, and, to my understanding, unconquerable difficulties in the way to them. 
These difficulties it is my present purpose to state, declaring, at the same time, that 
so far from exulting in them, as a cause of triumph over the friends of innovation, 
nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see them completely removed. 
The most important argument that I shall adduce is certainly not new. The 
principles on which it depends have been explained in part by Hume, and more at 
large by Dr Adam Smith. It has been advanced and applied to the present subject, 
though not with its proper weight, or in the most forcible point of view, by Mr 
Wallace, and it may probably have been stated by many writers that I have never 
met with. I should certainly therefore not think of advancing it again, though I 
mean to place it in a point of view in some degree different from any that I have 
hitherto seen, if it had ever been fairly and satisfactorily answered. 
The cause of this neglect on the part of the advocates for the perfectibility of 
mankind is not easily accounted for. I cannot doubt the talents of such men as 
Godwin and Condorcet. I am unwilling to doubt their candour. To my 
understanding, and probably to that of most others, the difficulty appears 
insurmountable. Yet these men of acknowledged ability and penetration scarcely 
deign to notice it, and hold on their course in such speculations with unabated 

ardour and undiminished confidence. I have certainly no right to say that they 
purposely shut their eyes to such arguments. I ought rather to doubt the validity of 
them, when neglected by such men, however forcibly their truth may strike my own 
mind. Yet in this respect it must be acknowledged that we are all of us too prone to 
err. If I saw a glass of wine repeatedly presented to a man, and he took no notice of 
it, I should be apt to think that he was blind or uncivil. A juster philosophy might 
teach me rather to think that my eyes deceived me and that the offer was not really 
what I conceived it to be. 
In entering upon the argument I must premise that I put out of the question, 
at present, all mere conjectures, that is, all suppositions, the probable realization of 
which cannot be inferred upon any just philosophical grounds. A writer may tell me 
that he thinks man will ultimately become an ostrich. I cannot properly contradict 
him. But before he can expect to bring any reasonable person over to his opinion, he 
ought to show that the necks of mankind have been gradually elongating, that the 
lips have grown harder and more prominent, that the legs and feet are daily altering 
their shape, and that the hair is beginning to change into stubs of feathers. And till 
the probability of so wonderful a conversion can be shown, it is surely lost time and 
lost eloquence to expatiate on the happiness of man in such a state; to describe his 
powers, both of running and flying, to paint him in a condition where all narrow 
luxuries would be contemned, where he would be employed only in collecting the 
necessaries of life, and where, consequently, each man=s share of labour would be 
light, and his portion of leisure ample. 
I think I may fairly make two postulates. 
First, That food is necessary to the existence of man. 
Secondly, That the passion between the sexes is necessary and will remain 
nearly in its present state. 
These two laws, ever since we have had any knowledge of mankind, appear to 
have been fixed laws of our nature, and, as we have not hitherto seen any alteration 
in them, we have no right to conclude that they will ever cease to be what they now 
are, without an immediate act of power in that Being who first arranged the system 
of the universe, and for the advantage of his creatures, still executes, according to 
fixed laws, all its various operations. 
I do not know that any writer has supposed that on this earth man will 
ultimately be able to live without food. But Mr Godwin has conjectured that the 
passion between the sexes may in time be extinguished. As, however, he calls this 
part of his work a deviation into the land of conjecture, I will not dwell longer upon 
it at present than to say that the best arguments for the perfectibility of man are 
drawn from a contemplation of the great progress that he has already made from 
the savage state and the difficulty of saying where he is to stop. But towards the 
extinction of the passion between the sexes, no progress whatever has hitherto been 
made. It appears to exist in as much force at present as it did two thousand or four 
thousand years ago. There are individual exceptions now as there always have been. 
But, as these exceptions do not appear to increase in number, it would surely be a 
very unphilosophical mode of arguing to infer, merely from the existence of an 
exception, that the exception would, in time, become the rule, and the rule the 
exception. 
Assuming then my postulates as granted, I say, that the power of population 
is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man. 

Population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio. Subsistence 
increases only in an arithmetical ratio. A slight acquaintance with numbers will 
show the immensity of the first power in comparison of the second. 
By that law of our nature which makes food necessary to the life of man, the 
effects of these two unequal powers must be kept equal. 
This implies a strong and constantly operating check on population from the 
difficulty of subsistence. This difficulty must fall somewhere and must necessarily be 
severely felt by a large portion of mankind. 
Through the animal and vegetable kingdoms, nature has scattered the seeds 
of life abroad with the most profuse and liberal hand. She has been comparatively 
sparing in the room and the nourishment necessary to rear them. The germs of 
existence contained in this spot of earth, with ample food, and ample room to 
expand in, would fill millions of worlds in the course of a few thousand years. 
Necessity, that imperious all pervading law of nature, restrains them within the 
prescribed bounds. The race of plants and the race of animals shrink under this 
great restrictive law. And the race of man cannot, by any efforts of reason, escape 
from it. Among plants and animals its effects are waste of seed, sickness, and 
premature death. Among mankind, misery and vice. The former, misery, is an 
absolutely necessary consequence of it. Vice is a highly probable consequence, and 
we therefore see it abundantly prevail, but it ought not, perhaps, to be called an 
absolutely necessary consequence. The ordeal of virtue is to resist all temptation to 
evil. 

This natural inequality of the two powers of population and of production in 
the earth, and that great law of our nature which must constantly keep their effects 
equal, form the great difficulty that to me appears insurmountable in the way to the 
perfectibility of society. All other arguments are of slight and subordinate 
consideration in comparison of this. I see no way by which man can escape from the 
weight of this law which pervades all animated nature. No fancied equality, no 
agrarian regulations in their utmost extent, could remove the pressure of it even for 
a single century. And it appears, therefore, to be decisive against the possible 
existence of a society, all the members of which should live in ease, happiness, and 
comparative leisure; and feel no anxiety about providing the means of subsistence 
for themselves and families. 
Consequently, if the premises are just, the argument is conclusive against the 
perfectibility of the mass of mankind. 
I have thus sketched the general outline of the argument, but I will examine 
it more particularly, and I think it will be found that experience, the true source 
and foundation of all knowledge, invariably confirms its truth. 

CHAPTER 2 
The different ratio in which population and food increase- The necessary effects of 
these different ratios of increase - Oscillation produced by them in the condition of 
the lower classesof society - Reasons why this oscillation has not been somuch 
observed as might be expected - Three propositions on which the general argument 
of the Essay depends -- The different states in which mankind have been known to 
exist proposed to beexaminedwith reference to these three propositions. 

I SAID that population, when unchecked, increased in a geometrical ratio, 
and subsistence for man in an arithmetical ratio. 
Let us examine whether this position be just. I think it will be allowed, that 
no state has hitherto existed (at least that we have any account of) where the 
manners were so pure and simple, and the means of subsistence so abundant, that 
no check whatever has existed to early marriages, among the lower classes, from a 
fear of not providing well for their families, or among the higher classes, from a fear 
of lowering their condition in life. Consequently in no state that we have yet known 
has the power of population been left to exert itself with perfect freedom. 
Whether the law of marriage be instituted or not, the dictate of nature and 
virtue seems to be an early attachment to one woman. Supposing a liberty of 
changing in the case of an unfortunate choice, this liberty would not affect 
population till it arose to a height greatly vicious; and we are now supposing the 
existence of a society where vice is scarcely known. 
In a state therefore of great equality and virtue, where pure and simple 
manners prevailed, and where the means of subsistence were so abundant that no 
part of the society could have any fears about providing amply for a family, the 
power of population being left to exert itself unchecked, the increase of the human 
species would evidently be much greater than any increase that has been hitherto 
known. 
In the United States of America, where the means of subsistence have been 
more ample, the manners of the people more pure, and consequently the checks to 
early marriages fewer, than in any of the modern states of Europe, the population 
has been found to double itself in twenty-five years. 
This ratio of increase, though short of the utmost power of population, yet as 
the result of actual experience, we will take as our rule, and say, that population, 
when unchecked, goes on doubling itself every twenty-five years or increases in a 
geometrical ratio. 
Let us now take any spot of earth, this Island for instance, and see in what 
ratio the subsistence it affords can be supposed to increase. We will begin with it 
under its present state of cultivation. 
If I allow that by the best possible policy, by breaking up more land and by 
great encouragements to agriculture, the produce of this Island may be doubled in 
the first twenty-five years, I think it will be allowing as much as any person can well 
demand. 
In the next twenty-five years, it is impossible to suppose that the produce 
could be quadrupled. It would be contrary to all our knowledge of the qualities of 
land. The very utmost that we can conceive, is, that the increase in the second 
twenty-five years might equal the present produce. Let us then take this for our 
rule, though certainly far beyond the truth, and allow that, by great exertion, the 
whole produce of the Island might be increased every twenty-five years, by a 
quantity of subsistence equal to what it at present produces. The most enthusiastic 
speculator cannot suppose a greater increase than this. In a few centuries it would 
make every acre of land in the Island like a garden. 
Yet this ratio of increase is evidently arithmetical. 
It may be fairly said, therefore, that the means of subsistence increase in an 
arithmetical ratio. Let us now bring the effects of these two ratios together. 

The population of the Island is computed to be about seven millions, and we 
will suppose the present produce equal to the support of such a number. In the first 
twenty-five years the population would be fourteen millions, and the food being also 
doubled, the means of subsistence would be equal to this increase. In the next 
twenty-five years the population would be twenty-eight millions, and the means of 
subsistence only equal to the support of twenty-one millions. In the next period, the 
population would be fifty-six millions, and the means of subsistence just sufficient 
for half that number. And at the conclusion of the first century the population 
would be one hundred and twelve millions and the means of subsistence only equal 
to the support of thirty-five millions, which would leave a population of 
seventy-seven millions totally unprovided for. 
A great emigration necessarily implies unhappiness of some kind or other in 
the country that is deserted. For few persons will leave their families, connections, 
friends, and native land, to seek a settlement in untried foreign climes, without some 
strong subsisting causes of uneasiness where they are, or the hope of some great 
advantages in the place to which they are going. 
But to make the argument more general and less interrupted by the partial 
views of emigration, let us take the whole earth, instead of one spot, and suppose 
that the restraints to population were universally removed. If the subsistence for 
man that the earth affords was to be increased every twenty-five years by a 
quantity equal to what the whole world at present produces, this would allow the 
power of production in the earth to be absolutely unlimited, and its ratio of increase 
much greater than we can conceive that any possible exertions of mankind could 
make it. 
Taking the population of the world at any number, a thousand millions, for 
instance, the human species would increase in the ratio of -- 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 
128, 256, 512, etc. and subsistence as -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc. In two 
centuries and a quarter, the population would be to the means of subsistence as 512 
to 10: in three centuries as 4096 to 13, and in two thousand years the difference 
would be almost incalculable, though the produce in that time would have increased 
to an immense extent. 
No limits whatever are placed to the productions of the earth; they may 
increase for ever and be greater than any assignable quantity. yet still the power of 
population being a power of a superior order, the increase of the human species can 
only be kept commensurate to the increase of the means of subsistence by the 
constant operation of the strong law of necessity acting as a check upon the greater 
power. 
The effects of this check remain now to be considered. 
Among plants and animals the view of the subject is simple. They are all 
impelled by a powerful instinct to the increase of their species, and this instinct is 
interrupted by no reasoning or doubts about providing for their offspring. Wherever 
therefore there is liberty, the power of increase is exerted, and the superabundant 
effects are repressed afterwards by want of room and nourishment, which is common 
to animals and plants, and among animals by becoming the prey of others. 
The effects of this check on man are more complicated. Impelled to the 
increase of his species by an equally powerful instinct, reason interrupts his career 
and asks him whether he may not bring beings into the world for whom he cannot 
provide the means of subsistence. In a state of equality, this would be the simple 

question. In the present state of society, other considerations occur. Will he not 
lower his rank in life? Will he not subject himself to greater difficulties than he at 
present feels? Will he not be obliged to labour harder? and if he has a large family, 
will his utmost exertions enable him to support them? May he not see his offspring 
in rags and misery, and clamouring for bread that he cannot give them? And may 
he not be reduced to the grating necessity of forfeiting his independence, and of 
being obliged to the sparing hand of charity for support? 
These considerations are calculated to prevent, and certainly do prevent, a 
very great number in all civilized nations from pursuing the dictate of nature in an 
early attachment to one woman. And this restraint almost necessarily, though not 
absolutely so, produces vice. Yet in all societies, even those that are most vicious, 
the tendency to a virtuous attachment is so strong that there is a constant effort 
towards an increase of population. This constant effort as constantly tends to 
subject the lower classes of the society to distress and to prevent any great 
permanent amelioration of their condition. 
The way in which, these effects are produced seems to be this. We will 
suppose the means of subsistence in any country just equal to the easy support of its 
inhabitants. The constant effort towards population, which is found to act even in 
the most vicious societies, increases the number of people before the means of 
subsistence are increased. The food therefore which before supported seven millions 
must now be divided among seven millions and a half or eight millions. The poor 
consequently must live much worse, and many of them be reduced to severe 
distress. The number of labourers also being above the proportion of the work in the 
market, the price of labour must tend toward a decrease, while the price of 
provisions would at the same time tend to rise. The labourer therefore must work 
harder to earn the same as he did before. During this season of distress, the 
discouragements to marriage, and the difficulty of rearing a family are so great that 
population is at a stand. In the mean time the cheapness of labour, the plenty of 
labourers, and the necessity of an increased industry amongst them, encourage 
cultivators to employ more labour upon their land, to turn up fresh soil, and to 
manure and improve more completely what is already in tillage, till ultimately the 
means of subsistence become in the same proportion to the population as at the 
period from which we set out. The situation of the labourer being then again 
tolerably comfortable, the restraints to population are in some degree loosened, and 
the same retrograde and progressive movements with respect to happiness are 
repeated. 
This sort of oscillation will not be remarked by superficial observers, and it 
may be difficult even for the most penetrating mind to calculate its periods. Yet 
that in all old states some such vibration does exist, though from various transverse 
causes, in a much less marked, and in a much more irregular manner than I have 
described it, no reflecting man who considers the subject deeply can well doubt. 
Many reasons occur why this oscillation has been less obvious, and less 
decidedly confirmed by experience, than might naturally be expected. 
One principal reason is that the histories of mankind that we possess are 
histories only of the higher classes. We have but few accounts that can be depended 
upon of the manners and customs of that part of mankind where these retrograde 
and progressive movements chiefly take place. A satisfactory history of this kind, on 
one people, and of one period, would require the constant and minute attention of 

an observing mind during a long life. Some of the objects of inquiry would be, in 
what proportion to the number of adults was the number of marriages, to what 
extent vicious customs prevailed in consequence of the restraints upon matrimony, 
what was the comparative mortality among the children of the most distressed part 
of the community and those who lived rather more at their ease, what were the 
variations in the real price of labour, and what were the observable differences in 
the state of the lower classes of society with respect to ease and happiness, at 
different times during a certain period. 
Such a history would tend greatly to elucidate the manner in which the 
constant check upon population acts and would probably prove the existence of the 
retrograde and progressive movements that have been mentioned, though the times 
of their vibrations must necessarily be rendered irregular from the operation of 
many interrupting causes, such as the introduction or failure of certain 
manufactures, a greater or less prevalent spirit of agricultural enterprise, years of 
plenty, or years of scarcity, wars and pestilence, poor laws, the invention of 
processes for shortening labour without the proportional extension of the market for 
the commodity, and, particularly, the difference between the nominal and real price 
of labour, a circumstance which has perhaps more than any other contributed to 
conceal this oscillation from common view. 
It very rarely happens that the nominal price of labour universally falls, but 
we well know that it frequently remains the same, while the nominal price of 
provisions has been gradually increasing. This is, in effect, a real fall in the price of 
labour, and during this period the condition of the lower orders of the community 
must gradually grow worse and worse. But the farmers and capitalists are growing 
rich from the real cheapness of labour. Their increased capitals enable them to 
employ a greater number of men. Work therefore may be plentiful, and the price of 
labour would consequently rise. But the want of freedom in the market of labour, 
which occurs more or less in all communities, either from parish laws, or the more 
general cause of the facility of combination among the rich, and its difficulty among 
the poor, operates to prevent the price of labour from rising at the natural period, 
and keeps it down some time longer; perhaps till a year of scarcity, when the 
clamour is too loud and the necessity too apparent to be resisted. 
The true cause of the advance in the price of labour is thus concealed, and 
the rich affect to grant it as an act of compassion and favour to the poor, in 
consideration of a year of scarcity, and, when plenty returns, indulge themselves in 
the most unreasonable of all complaints, that the price does not again fall, when a 
little rejection would show them that it must have risen long before but from an 
unjust conspiracy of their own. 
But though the rich by unfair combinations contribute frequently to prolong 
a season of distress among the poor, yet no possible form of society could prevent 
the almost constant action of misery upon a great part of mankind, if in a state of 
inequality, and upon all, if all were equal. 
The theory on which the truth of this position depends appears to me so 
extremely clear that I feel at a loss to conjecture what part of it can be denied. 
That population cannot increase without the means of subsistence is a 
proposition so evident that it needs no illustration. 

That population does invariably increase where there are the means of 
subsistence, the history of every people that have ever existed will abundantly 
prove. 
And that the superior power of population cannot be checked without 
producing misery or vice, the ample portion of these too bitter ingredients in the 
cup of human life and the continuance of the. physical causes that seem to have 
produced them bear too convincing a testimony. 
But, in order more fully to ascertain the validity of these three propositions, 
let us examine the different states in which mankind have been known to exist. 
Even a cursory review will, I think, be sufficient to convince us that these 
propositions are incontrovertible truths. 

CHAPTER 3 
The savage or hunter state shortly reviewed - The shepherd state, or the tribes of 
barbarians that overran the Roman Empire - The superiority of the power of 
population to the means of subsistence - the cause of the great tide of Northern 
Emigration. 

IN the rudest state of mankind, in which hunting is the principal occupation, 
and the only mode of acquiring food, the means of subsistence being scattered over a 
large extent of territory, the comparative population must necessarily be thin. It is 
said that the passion between the sexes is less ardent among the North American 
Indians than among any other race of men. Yet, notwithstanding this apathy, the 
effort towards population, even in this people, seems to be always greater than the 
means to support it. This appears from the comparatively rapid population that 
takes place whenever any of the tribes happen to settle in some fertile spot and to 
draw nourishment from more fruitful sources than that of hunting, and it has been 
frequently remarked that when an Indian family has taken up its abode near any 
European settlement and adopted a more easy and civilized mode of life, that one 
woman has reared five, or six, or more children, though in the savage state it rarely 
happens that above one or two in a family grow up to maturity. The same 
observation has been made with regard to the Hottentots near the Cape. These facts 
prove the superior power of population to the means of subsistence in nations of 
hunters, and that this power always shows itself the moment it is left to act with 
freedom. 
It remains to inquire whether this power can be checked, and its effects kept 
equal to the means of subsistence, without vice or misery. . . . 
May we not . . fairly infer . . . from the accounts that may be referred to of 
nations of hunters, that their population is thin from the scarcity of food, that it 
would immediately increase if food was in greater plenty, and that, putting vice out 
of the question among savages, misery is the check that represses the superior power 
of population and keeps its effects equal to the means of subsistence. Actual 
observation and experience tell us that this check, with a few local and temporary 
exceptions, is constantly acting now upon all savage nations, and the theory 
indicates that it probably acted with nearly equal strength a thousand years ago, 
and it may not be much greater a thousand years hence. 
Of the manners and habits that prevail among nations of shepherds, the next 
state of mankind, we are even more ignorant than of the savage state. But that 

these nations could not escape the general lot of misery arising from the want of 
subsistence, Europe, and all the fairest countries in the world, bear ample 
testimony. . . . It is well known that a country in pasture cannot support so many 
inhabitants as a country in tillage, but what renders nations of shepherds so 
formidable is the power which they possess of moving all together and the necessity 
they frequently feel of exerting this power in search of fresh pasture for their herds. 
A tribe that was rich in cattle had an immediate plenty of food. Even the parent 
stock might be devoured in a case of absolute necessity. The women lived in greater 
ease than among nations of hunters. The men bold in their united strength and 
confiding in their power of procuring pasture for their cattle by change of place, felt, 
probably, but few fears about providing for a family. These combined causes soon 
produced their natural and invariable effect, an extended population. A more 
frequent and rapid change of place became then necessary. A wider and more 
extensive territory was successively occupied. A broader desolation extended all 
around them. Want pinched the less fortunate members of the society, and, at 
length, the impossibility of supporting such a number together became too evident 
to be resisted. Young scions were then pushed out from the parent-stock and 
instructed to explore fresh regions and to gain happier seats for themselves by their 
swords. >The world was all before them where to choose.= [Milton] Restless from 
present distress, flushed with the hope of fairer prospects, and animated with the 
spirit of hardy enterprise, these daring adventurers were likely to become formidable 
adversaries to all who opposed them. The peaceful inhabitants of the countries on 
which they rushed could not long withstand the energy of men acting under such 
powerful motives of exertion. And when they fell in with any tribes like their own, 
the contest was a struggle for existence, and they fought with a desperate courage, 
inspired by the reflection that death was the punishment of defeat and life the prize 
of victory. 
. . . Among these bold and improvident Barbarians, population was probably 
but little checked, as in modern states, from a fear of future difficulties. A prevailing 
hope of bettering their condition by change of place, a constant expectation of 
plunder, a power even, if distressed, of selling their children as slaves, added to the 
natural carelessness of the barbaric character, all conspired to raise a population 
which remained to be repressed afterwards by famine or war.  Where there is any 
inequality of conditions, and among nations of shepherds this soon takes place, the 
distress arising from a scarcity of provisions must fall hardest upon the least 
fortunate members of the society. This distress also must frequently have been felt 
by the women, exposed to casual plunder in the absence of their husbands, and 
subject to continual disappointments in their expected return. 
But without knowing enough of the minute and intimate history of these 
people, to point out precisely on what part the distress for want of food chiefly fell, 
and to what extent it was generally felt, I think we may fairly say, from all the 
accounts that we have of nations of shepherds, that population invariably increased 
among them whenever, by emigration or any other cause, the means of subsistence 
were increased, and that a further population was checked, and the actual 
population kept equal to the means of subsistence, by misery and vice. 
For, independently of any vicious customs that might have prevailed amongst 
them with regard to women, which always operate as checks to population, it must 

be acknowledged, I think, that the commission of war is vice, and the effect of it 
misery, and none can doubt the misery of want of food.

State of civilized nations - Probability that Europe is much more populous now than 
in the time of Julius Caesar - Best criterion of population - Probable error of Hume 
in one the criterions that he proposes as assisting in an estimate of population (cid:173)
Slow increase of population at present in most of the states of Europe- The two 
principal checks to population - The first, or preventive check examined with regard 
to England. 

IN examining the next state of mankind with relation to the question before 
us, the state of mixed pasture and tillage, in which with some variation in the 
proportions the most civilized nations must always remain, we shall be assisted in 
our review by what we daily see around us, by actual experience, by facts that come 
within the scope of every man=s observation. 
Notwithstanding the exaggerations of some old historians, there can remain 
no doubt in the mind of any thinking man that the population of the principal 
countries of Europe, France, England, Germany, Russia, Poland, Sweden, and 
Denmark is much greater than ever it was in former times. The obvious reason of 
these exaggerations is the formidable aspect that even a thinly peopled nation must 
have, when collected together and moving all at once in search of fresh seats. If to 
this tremendous appearance be added a succession at certain intervals of similar 
emigrations, we shall not be much. surprised that the fears of the timid nations of 
the South represented the North as a region absolutely swarming with human 
beings. A nearer and juster view of the subject at present enables us to see that the 
inference was as absurd as if a man in this country, who was continually meeting on 
the road droves of cattle from Wales and the North, was immediately to conclude 
that these countries were the most productive of all the parts of the kingdom. 
The reason that the greater part of Europe is more populous now than it was 
in former times, is that the industry of the inhabitants has made these countries 
produce a greater quantity of human subsistence. For I conceive that it may be laid 
down as a position not to be controverted, that, taking a sufficient extent of 
territory to include within it exportation and importation, and allowing some 
variation for the prevalence of luxury, or of frugal habits, that population constantly 
bears a regular proportion to the food that the earth is made to produce. In the 
controversy concerning the populousness of ancient and modern nations, could it be 
clearly ascertained that the average produce of the countries in question, taken 
altogether, is greater now than it was in the times of Julius Caesar, the dispute 
would be at once determined. . . . 
In examining the principal states of modern Europe, we shall find that though 
they have increased very considerably in population since they were nations of 
shepherds, yet that at present their progress is but slow, and instead of doubling 
their numbers every twenty-five years they require three or four hundred years, or 
more, for that purpose. Some, indeed, may be absolutely stationary, and others even 
retrograde. The cause of this slow progress in population cannot be traced to a 
decay of the passion between the sexes. We have sufficient reason to think that this 
natural propensity exists still in undiminished vigour. Why then do not its effects 

appear in a rapid increase of the human species? An intimate view of the state of 
society in any one country in Europe, which may serve equally for all, will enable us 
to answer this question, and to say that a foresight of the difficulties attending the 
rearing of a family acts as a preventive check, and the actual distresses of some of 
the lower classes, by which they are disabled from giving the proper food and 
attention to their children, act as a positive check to the natural increase of 
population. 
England, as one of the most flourishing states of Europe, may be fairly taken 
for an example, and the observations made will apply with but little variation to 
any other country where the population increases slowly. 
The preventive check appears to operate in some degree through all the ranks 
of society in England. There are some men, even in the highest rank, who are 
prevented from marrying by the idea of the expenses that they must retrench, and 
the fancied pleasures that they must deprive themselves of, on the supposition of 
having a family. These considerations are certainly trivial, but a preventive foresight 
of this kind has objects of much greater weight for its contemplation as we go lower. 
A man of liberal education, but with an income only just sufficient to enable 
him to associate in the rank of gentlemen, must feel absolutely certain that if he 
marries and has a family he shall be obliged, if he mixes at all in society, to rank 
himself with moderate farmers and the lower class of tradesmen. The woman that a 
man of education would naturally make the object of his choice would be one 
brought up in the same tastes and sentiments with himself and used to the familiar 
intercourse of a society totally different from that to which she must be reduced by 
marriage. Can a man consent to place the object of his affection in a situation so 
discordant, probably, to her tastes and inclinations? Two or three steps of descent in 
society, particularly at this round of the ladder, where education ends and ignorance 
begins, will not be considered by the generality of people as a fancied and 
chimerical, but a real and essential evil. If society be held desirable, it surely must 
be free, equal, and reciprocal society, where benefits are conferred as well as 
received, and not such as the dependent finds with his patron or the poor with the 
rich. 

These considerations undoubtedly prevent a great number in this rank of life 
from following the bent of their inclinations in an early attachment. Others, guided 
either by a stronger passion, or a weaker judgement, break through these restraints, 
and it would be hard indeed, if the gratification of so delightful a passion as virtuous 
love, did not, sometimes, more than counterbalance all its attendant evils. But I fear 
it must be owned that the more general consequences of such marriages are rather 
calculated to justify than to repress the forebodings of the prudent. 
The sons of tradesmen and farmers are exhorted not to marry, and generally 
find it necessary to pursue this advice till they are settled in some business or farm 
that may enable them to support a family. These events may not, perhaps, occur till 
they are far advanced in life. The scarcity of farms is a very general complaint in 
England. And the competition in every kind of business is so great that it is not 
possible that all should be successful. 
The labourer who earns eighteen pence a day and lives with some degree of 
comfort as a single man, will hesitate a little before he divides that pittance among 
four or five, which seems to be but just sufficient for one. Harder fare and harder 
labour he would submit to for the sake of living with the woman that he loves, but 

he must feel conscious, if he thinks at all, that should he have a large family, and 
any ill luck whatever, no degree of frugality, no possible exertion of his manual 
strength could preserve him from the heart-rending sensation of seeing his children 
starve, or of forfeiting his independence, and being obliged to the parish for their 
support. The love of independence is a sentiment that surely none would wish to be 
erased from the breast of man, though the parish law of England, it must be 
confessed, is a system of all others the most calculated gradually to weaken this 
sentiment, and in the end may eradicate it completely. 
The servants who live in gentlemen=s families have restraints that are yet 
stronger to break through in venturing upon marriage. They possess the necessaries, 
and even the comforts of life, almost in as great plenty as their masters. Their work 
is easy and their food luxurious compared with the class of labourers. And their 
sense of dependence is weakened by the conscious power of changing their masters, 
if they feel themselves offended. Thus comfortably situated at present, what are 
their prospects in marrying? Without knowledge or capital, either for business, or 
farming, and unused and therefore unable, to earn a subsistence by daily labour, 
their only refuge seems to be a miserable alehouse, which certainly offers no very 
enchanting prospect of a happy evening to their lives. By much the greater part, 
therefore, deterred by this uninviting view of their future situation, content 
themselves with remaining single where they are. 
If this sketch of the state of society in England be near the truth, and I do 
not conceive that it is exaggerated, it will be allowed that the preventive check to 
population in this country operates, though with varied force, through all the classes 
of the community. The same observation will hold true with regard to all old states. 
The effects, indeed, of these restraints upon marriage are but too conspicuous in the 
consequent vices that are produced in almost every part of the world, vices that are 
continually involving both sexes in inextricable unhappiness. 

CHAPTER 5 
The second, or positive check to population examined, in England - The true cause 
why th immense sumcollected inEngland for the poor does not better their 
condition - The powerful tendency of the poor lawsto defeat their own purpose -
Palliativeof the distresses of the poor proposed - The absolute impossibility, from 
the fixed laws of our nature, that the pressure of want can ever be completely 
removed from the lower classes of society - All the checks to population may be 
resolved into miseryor vice. 

THE positive check to population, by which I mean the check that represses 
an increase which is already begun, is confined chiefly, though not perhaps solely, to 
the lowest orders of society. 

This check is not so obvious to common view as the other I have mentioned, and, to 
prove distinctly the force and extent of its operation would require, perhaps, more 
data than we are in possession of. But I believe it has been very generally remarked 
by those who have attended to bills of mortality that of the number of children who 
die annually, much too great a proportion belongs to those who may be supposed 
unable to give their offspring proper food and attention, exposed as they are 
occasionally to severe distress and confined, perhaps, to unwholesome habitations 

and hard labour. This mortality among the children of the poor has been constantly 
taken notice of in all towns. It certainly does not prevail in an equal degree in the 
country, but the subject has not hitherto received sufficient attention to enable 
anyone to say that there are not more deaths in proportion among the children of 
the poor, even in the country, than among those of the middling and higher classes. 
Indeed, it seems difficult to suppose that a labourer=s wife who has six children, and 
who is sometimes in absolute want of bread, should be able always to give them the 
food and attention necessary to support life. The sons and daughters of peasants will 
not be found such rosy cherubs in real life as they are described to be in romances. 
It cannot fail to be remarked by those who live much in the country that the sons of 
labourers are very apt to be stunted in their growth, and are a long while arriving 
at maturity. Boys that you would guess to be fourteen or fifteen are, upon inquiry, 
frequently found to be eighteen or nineteen. And the lads who drive plough, which 
must certainly be a healthy exercise, are very rarely seen with any appearance of 
calves to their legs: a circumstance which can only be attributed to a want either of 
proper or of sufficient nourishment. 
To remedy the frequent distresses of the common people, the poor laws of 
England have been instituted; but it is to be feared, that though they may have 
alleviated a little the intensity of individual misfortune, they have spread the 
general evil over a much larger surface. It is a subject often started in conversation 
and mentioned always as a matter of great surprise that, notwithstanding the 
immense sum that is annually collected for the poor in England, there is still so 
much distress among them. Some think that the money must be embezzled, others 
that the church-wardens and overseers consume the greater part of it in dinners. All 
agree that somehow or other it must be very ill-managed. In short the fact that 
nearly three millions are collected annually for the poor and yet that their distresses 
are not removed is the subject of continual astonishment. But a man who sees a 
little below the surface of things would be very much more astonished if the fact 
were otherwise than it is observed to be, or even if a collection universally of 
eighteen shillings in the pound, instead of four, were materially to alter it. I will 
state a case which I hope will elucidate my meaning. 
Suppose that by a subscription of the rich the eighteen pence a day which 
men earn now was made up five shillings, it might be imagined, perhaps, that they 
would then be able to live comfortably and have a piece of meat every day for their 
dinners. But this would be a very false conclusion. The transfer of three shillings 
and sixpence a day to every labourer would not increase the quantity of meat in the 
country. There is not at present enough for all to have a decent share. What would 
then be the consequence? The competition among the buyers in the market of meat 
would rapidly raise the price from sixpence or sevenpence, to two or three shillings 
in the pound, and the commodity would not be divided among many more than it is 
at present. When an article is scarce, and cannot be distributed to all, he that can 
show the most valid patent, that is, he that offers most money, becomes the 
possessor. If we can suppose the competition among the buyers of meat to continue 
long enough for a greater number of cattle to be reared annually, this could only be 
done at the expense of the corn, which would be a very disadvantagous exchange, 
for it is well known that the country could not then support the same population, 
and when subsistence is scarce in proportion to the number of people, it is of little 
consequence whether the lowest members of the society possess eighteen pence or 

five shillings. They must at all events be reduced to live upon the hardest fare and 
in the smallest quantity. 
It will be said, perhaps, that the increased number of purchasers in every 
article would give a spur to productive industry and that the whole produce of the 
island would be increased. This might in some degree be the case. But the spur that 
these fancied riches would give to population would more than counterbalance it, 
and the increased produce would be to be divided among a more than 
proportionably increased number of people. All this time I am supposing that the 
same quantity of work would be done as before. But this would not really take 
place. The receipt of five shillings a day, instead of eighteen pence, would make 
every man fancy himself comparatively rich and able to indulge himself in many 
hours or days of leisure. This would give a strong and immediate check to 
productive industry, and, in a short time, not only the nation would be poorer, but 
the lower classes themselves would be much more distressed than when they 
received only eighteen pence a day. 
A collection from the rich of eighteen shillings in the pound, even if 
distributed in the most judicious manner, would have a little the same effect as that 
resulting from the supposition I have just made, and no possible contributions or 
sacrifices of the rich, particularly in money, could for any time prevent the 
recurrence of distress among the lower members of society, whoever they were. 
Great changes might, indeed, be made. The rich might become poor, and some of 
the poor rich, but a part of the society must necessarily feel a difficulty of living, 
and this difficulty will naturally fall on the least fortunate members. 
It may at first appear strange, but I believe it is true, that I cannot by means 
of money raise a poor man and enable him to live much better than he did before, 
without proportionably depressing others in the same class. If I retrench the 
quantity of food consumed in my house, and give him what I have cut off, I then 
benefit him, without depressing any.but myself and family, who, perhaps, may be 
well able to bear it. If I turn up a piece of uncultivated land, and give him the 
produce, I then benefit both him and all the members of the society, because what 
he before consumed is thrown into the common stock, and probably some of the new 
produce with it. But if I only give him money, supposing the produce of the country 
to remain the same, I give him a title to a larger share of that produce than 
formerly, which share he cannot receive without diminishing the shares of others. It 
is evident that this effect, in individual instances, must be so small as to be totally 
imperceptible; but still it must exist, as many other effects do, which, like some of 
the insects that people the air, elude our grosser perceptions. 
Supposing the quantity of food in any country to remain the same for many 
years together, it is evident that this food must be divided according to the value of 
each man=s patent, or the sum of money that he can afford to spend on this 
commodity so universally in request. (Mr Godwin calls the wealth that a man 
receives from his ancestors a mouldy patent. It may, I think, very properly be 
termed a patent, but I hardly see the propriety of calling it a mouldy one, as it is an 
article in such constant use.) It is a demonstrative truth, therefore, that the patents 
of one set of men could not be increased in value without diminishing the value of 
the patents of some other set of men. If the rich were to subscribe and give five 
shillings a day to five hundred thousand men without retrenching their own tables, 
no doubt can exist, that as these men would naturally live more at their ease and 

consume a greater quantity of provisions, there would be less food remaining to 
divide among the rest, and consequently each man=s patent would be diminished in 
value or the same number of pieces of silver would purchase a smaller quantity of 
subsistence. 
An increase of population without a proportional increase of food will 
evidently have the same effect in lowering the value of each man=s patent. The food 
must necessarily be distributed in smaller quantities, and consequently a day=s 
labour will purchase a smaller quantity of provisions. An increase in the price of 
provisions would arise either from an increase of population faster than the means of 
subsistence, or from a different distribution of the money of the society. The food of 
a country that has been long occupied, if it be increasing, increases slowly and 
regularly and cannot be made to answer any sudden demands, but variations in the 
distribution of the money of a society are not infrequently occurring, and are 
undoubtedly among the causes that occasion the continual variations which we 
observe in the price of provisions. 
The poor laws of England tend to depress the general condition of the poor in 
these two ways. Their first obvious tendency is to increase population without 
increasing the food for its support. A poor man may marry with little or no prospect 
of being able to support a family in independence. They may be said therefore in 
some measure to create the poor which they maintain, and as the provisions of the 
country must, in consequence of the increased population, be distributed to every 
man in smaller proportions, it is evident that the labour of those who are not 
supported by parish assistance will purchase a smaller quantity of provisions than 
before and consequently more of them must be driven to ask for support. 
Secondly, the quantity of provisions consumed in workhouses upon a part of 
the society that cannot in general be considered as the most valuable part 
diminishes the shares that would otherwise belong to more industrious and more 
worthy members, and thus in the same manner forces more to become dependent. If 
the poor in the workhouses were to live better than they now do, this new 
distribution of the money of the society would tend more conspicuously to depress 
the condition of those out of the workhouses by occasioning a rise in the price of 
provisions. 
Fortunately for England, a spirit of independence still remains among the 
peasantry. The poor laws are strongly calculated to eradicate this spirit. They have 
succeeded in part, but had they succeeded as completely as might have been 
expected their pernicious tendency would not have been so long concealed. 
Hard as it may appear in individual instances, dependent poverty ought to be 
held disgraceful. Such a stimulus seems to be absolutely necessary to promote the 
happiness of the great mass of mankind, and every general attempt to weaken this 
stimulus, however benevolent its apparent intention, will always defeat its own 
purpose. If men are induced to marry from a prospect of parish provision, with little 
or no chance of maintaining their families in independence, they are not only 
unjustly tempted to bring unhappiness and dependence upon themselves and 
children, but they are tempted, without knowing it, to injure all in the same class 
with themselves. A labourer who marries without being able to support a family 
may in some respects be considered as an enemy to all his fellow-labourers. 
I feel no doubt whatever that the parish laws of England have contributed to 
raise the price of provisions and to lower the real price of labour. They have 

therefore contributed to impoverish that class of people whose only possession is 
their labour. It is also difficult to suppose that they have not powerfully contributed 
to generate that carelessness and want of frugality observable among the poor, so 
contrary to the disposition frequently to be remarked among petty tradesmen and 
small farmers. The labouring poor, to use a vulgar expression, seem always to live 
from hand to mouth. Their present wants employ their whole attention, and they 
seldom think of the future. Even when they have an opportunity of saving they 
seldom exercise it, but all that is beyond their present necessities goes, generally 
speaking, to the ale-house. The poor laws of England may therefore be said to 
diminish both the power and the will to save among the common people, and thus 
to weaken one of the strongest incentives to sobriety and industry, and consequently 
to happiness. 
It is a general complaint among master manufacturers that high wages ruin 
all their workmen, but it is difficult to conceive that these men would not save a 
part of their high wages for the future support of their families, instead of spending 
it in drunkenness and dissipation, if they did not rely on parish assistance for 
support in case of accidents. And that the poor employed in manufactures consider 
this assistance as a reason why they may spend all the wages they earn and enjoy 
themselves while they can appears to be evident from the number of families that, 
upon the failure of any great manufactory, immediately fall upon the parish, when 
perhaps the wages earned in this manufactory while it flourished were sufficiently 
above the price of common country labour to have allowed them to save enough for 
their support till they could find some other channel for their industry. 
A man who might not be deterred from going to the ale-house from the 
consideration that on his death, or sickness, he should leave his wife and family 
upon the parish might yet hesitate in thus dissipating his earnings if he were assured 
that, in either of these cases, his family must starve or be left to the support of 
casual bounty. In China, where the real as well as nominal price of labour is very 
low, sons are yet obliged by law to support their aged and helpless parents. Whether 
such a law would be advisable in this country I will not pretend to determine. But it 
seems at any rate highly improper, by positive institutions, which render dependent 
poverty so general, to weaken that disgrace, which for the best and most humane 
reasons ought to attach to it. 
The mass of happiness among the common people cannot but be diminished 
when one of the strongest checks to idleness and dissipation is thus removed, and 
when men are thus allured to marry with little or no prospect of being able to 
maintain a family in independence. Every obstacle in the way of marriage must 
undoubtedly be considered as a species of unhappiness. But as from the laws of our 
nature some check to population must exist, it is better that it should be checked 
from a foresight of the difficulties attending a family and the fear of dependent 
poverty than that it should be encouraged, only to be repressed afterwards by want 
and sickness. 
It should be remembered always that there is an essential difference between 
food and those wrought commodities, the raw materials of which are in great plenty. 
A demand for these last will not fail to create them in as great a quantity as they 
are wanted. The demand for food has by no means the same creative power. In a 
country where all the fertile spots have been seized, high offers are necessary to 
encourage the farmer to lay his dressing on land from which he cannot expect a 

profitable return for some years. And before the prospect of advantage is sufficiently 
great to encourage this sort of agricultural enterprise, and while the new produce is 
rising, great distresses may be suffered from the want of it. The demand for an 
increased quantity of subsistence is, with few exceptions, constant everywhere, yet 
we see how slowly it is answered in all those countries that have been long occupied. 
The poor laws of England were undoubtedly instituted for the most 
benevolent purpose, but there is great reason to think that they have not succeeded 
in their intention. They certainly mitigate some cases of very severe distress which 
might otherwise occur, yet the state of the poor who are supported by parishes, 
considered in all its circumstances, is very far from being free from misery. But one 
of the principal objections to them is that for this assistance which some of the poor 
receive, in itself almost a doubtful blessing, the whole class of the common people of 
England is subjected to a set of grating, inconvenient, and tyrannical laws, totally 
inconsistent with the genuine spirit of the constitution. The whole business of 
settlements, even in its present amended state, is utterly contradictory to all ideas 
of freedom. The parish persecution of men whose families are likely to become 
chargeable, and of poor women who are near lying-in, is a most disgraceful and 
disgusting tyranny. And the obstructions continuity occasioned in the market of 
labour by these laws have a constant tendency to add to the difficulties of those who 
are struggling to support themselves without assistance. 
These evils attendant on the poor laws are in some degree irremediable. If 
assistance be to be distributed to a certain class of people, a power must be given 
somewhere of discriminating the proper objects and of managing the concerns of the 
institutions that are necessary, but any great interference with the affairs of other 
people is a species of tyranny, and in the common course of things the exercise of 
this power may be expected to become grating to those who are driven to ask for 
support. The tyranny of Justices, Church-wardens, and Overseers, is a common 
complaint among the poor, but the fault does not lie so much in these persons, who 
probably, before they were in power, were not worse than other people, but in the 
nature of all such institutions. 
The evil is perhaps gone too far to be remedied, but I feel little doubt in my 
own mind that if the poor laws had never existed, though there might have been a 
few more instances of very severe distress, yet that the aggregate mass of happiness 
among the common people would have been much greater than it is at present. . . . 
To remove the wants of the lower classes of society is indeed an arduous task. 
The truth is that the pressure of distress on this part of a community is an evil so 
deeply seated that no human ingenuity can reach it. Were I to propose a palliative, 
and palliatives are all that the nature of the case will admit, it should be, in the first 
place, the total abolition of all the present parish-laws. This would at any rate give 
liberty and freedom of action to the peasantry of England, which they can hardly be 
said to possess at present. They would then be able to settle without interruption, 
wherever there was a prospect of a greater plenty of work and a higher price for 
labour. The market of labour would then be free, and those obstacles removed 
which, as things are now, often for a considerable time prevent the price from rising 
according to the demand. 
Secondly, premiums might be given for turning up fresh land, and it possible 
encouragements held out to agriculture above manufactures, and to tillage above 
grazing. Every endeavour should be used to weaken and destroy all those 

institutions relating to corporations, apprenticeships, etc., which cause the labours of 
agriculture to be worse paid than the labours of trade and manufactures. For a 
country can never produce its proper quantity of food while these distinctions 
remain in favour of artisans. Such encouragements to agriculture would tend to 
furnish the market with an increasing quantity of healthy work, and at the same 
time, by augmenting the produce of the country, would raise the comparative price 
of labour and ameliorate the condition of the labourer. Being now in better 
circumstances, and seeing no prospect of parish assistance, he would be more able, 
as well as more inclined, to enter into associations for providing against the sickness 
of himself or family. 
Lastly, for cases of extreme distress, county workhouses might be established, 
supported by rates upon the whole kingdom, and free for persons of all counties, and 
indeed of all nations. The fare should be hard, and those that were able obliged to 
work. It would be desirable that they should not be considered as comfortable 
asylums in all difficulties, but merely as places where severe distress might find 
some alleviation. A part of these houses might be separated, or others built for a 
most beneficial purpose, which has not been infrequently taken notice of, that of 
providing a place where any person, whether native or foreigner, might do a day=s 
work at all times and receive the market price for it. Many cases would undoubtedly 
be left for the exertion of individual benevolence. 
A plan of this kind, the preliminary of which should be an abolition of all the 
present parish laws, seems to be the best calculated to increase the mass of 
happiness among the common people of England. To prevent the recurrence of 
misery, is, alas ! beyond the power of man. In the vain endeavour to attain what in 
the nature of things is impossible, we now sacrifice not only possible but certain 
benefits. We tell the common people that if they will submit to a code of tyrannical 
regulations, they shall never be in want. They do submit to these regulations. They 
perform their part of the contract, but we do not, nay cannot, perform ours, and 
thus the poor sacrifice the valuable blessing of liberty and receive nothing that can 
be called an equivalent in return. 
Notwithstanding, then, the institution of the poor laws in England, I think it 
will be allowed that considering the state of the lower classes altogether, both in the 
towns and in the country, the distresses which they suffer from the want of proper 
and sufficient food, from hard labour and unwholesome habitations, must operate as 
a constant check to incipient population. 
To these two great checks to population, in all long occupied countries, which 
I have called the preventive and the positive checks, may be added vicious customs 
with respect to women, great cities, unwholesome manufactures, luxury, pestilence, 
and war. 
All these checks may be fairly resolved into misery and vice. And that these 
are the true causes of the slow increase of population in all the states of modern 
Europe, will appear sufficiently evident from the comparatively rapid increase that 
has invariably taken place whenever these causes have been in any considerable 
degree removed. 

fromCHAPTERS 6 and 7 

[In considering fresh settlements of Europeans into colonies abroad] we should 
be led into an error if we were thence to suppose that population and food ever 
really increases in the same ratio. . . .  Where there are few people, and a great 
quantity of fertile land, the power of the earth to afford a yearly increase of food 
may be compared to a great reservoir of water, supplied by a moderate stream.  The 
faster population increases, the more help we be got to draw off the water, and 
consequently an increasing quantity will be taken every year.  But the sooner, 
undoubtedly with the reservoir be exhausted, and the streams only remain.  When 
acre has been added to acre, till all the fertile land is occupied, the yearly increase of 
food will depend upon the amelioration of the land already in possession; and even 
this moderate stream will be gradually diminishing.  These facts seem to show that 
population increases exactly in the proportion that the two great checks to it, 
misery and vice, are removed, and that there is not a truer criterion of the 
happiness and innocence of a people than the rapidity of their increase. The 
unwholesomeness of towns, to which some persons are necessarily driven from the 
nature of their trades, must be considered as a species of misery, and every the 
slightest check to marriage, from a prospect of the difficulty of maintaining a family, 
may be fairly classed under the same head. In short it is difficult to conceive any 
check to population which does not come under the description of some species of 
misery or vice.   . . .It accords with the most liberal spirit of philosophy to suppose 
that not a stone can fall, or a plant rise, without the immediate agency of divine 
power. But we know from experience that these operations of what we call nature 
have been conducted almost invariably according to fixed laws. And since the world 
began, the causes of population and depopulation have probably been as constant as 
any of the laws of nature with which we are acquainted. 
The passion between the sexes has appeared in every age to be so nearly the 
same that it may always be considered, in algebraic language, as a given quantity. 
The great law of necessity which prevents population from increasing in any country 
beyond the food which it can either produce or acquire, is a law so open to our view, 
so obvious and evident to our understandings, and so completely confirmed by the 
experience of every age, that we cannot for a moment doubt it. The different modes 
which nature takes to prevent or repress a redundant population do not appear, 
indeed, to us so certain and regular, but though we cannot always predict the mode 
we may with certainty predict the fact. If the proportion of births to deaths for a 
few years indicate an increase of numbers much beyond the proportional increased 
or acquired produce of the country, we may be perfectly certain that unless an 
emigration takes place, the deaths will shortly exceed the births; and that the 
increase that had taken place for a few years cannot be the real average increase of 
the population of the country. Were there no other depopulating causes, every 
country would, without doubt, be subject to periodical pestilences or famine. 

CHAPTER 8 
Mr Wallace - Error of supposing that the difficulty arising from population is at a 
great distance - Mr Condorcet=s sketch of the progress of the human mind- Period 
when the oscillation, mentioned by Mr Condorcet, ought to be applied to the human 
race. 

To a person who draws the preceding obvious inferences, from a view of the 
past and present state of mankind, it cannot but be a matter of astonishment that 
all the writers on the perfectibility of man and of society who have noticed the 
argument of an overcharged population, treat it always very slightly and invariably 
represent the difficulties arising from it as at a great and almost immeasurable 
distance. Even Mr Wallace, who thought the argument itself of so much weight as 
to destroy his whole system of equality, did not seem to be aware that any difficulty 
would occur from this cause till the whole earth had been cultivated like a garden 
and was incapable of any further increase of produce. Were this really the case, and 
were a beautiful system of equality in other respects practicable, I cannot think that 
our ardour in the pursuit of such a scheme ought to be damped by the 
contemplation of so remote a difficulty. An event at such a distance might fairly be 
left to providence, but the truth is that if the view of the argument given in this 
Essay be just the difficulty, so far from being remote, would be imminent and 
immediate. At every period during the progress of cultivation, from the present 
moment to the time when the whole earth was become like a garden, the distress for 
want of food would be constantly pressing on all mankind, if they were equal. 
Though the produce of the earth might be increasing every year, population would 
be increasing much faster, and the redundancy must necessarily be repressed by the 
periodical or constant action of misery or vice. 
Mr Condorcet=s Esquisse d=un Tableau Historique des Progres de l=Esprit 
Humain, was written, it is said, under the pressure of that cruel proscription which 
terminated in his death. If he had no hopes of its being seen during his life and of its 
interesting France in his favour, it is a singular instance of the attachment of a man 
to principles, which every day=s experience was so fatally for himself contradicting. 
To see the human mind in one of the most enlightened nations of the world, and 
after a lapse of some thousand years, debased by such a fermentation of disgusting 
passions, of fear, cruelty, malice, revenge, ambition, madness, and folly as would 
have disgraced the most savage nation in the most barbarous age must have been 
such a tremendous shock to his ideas of the necessary and inevitable progress of the 
human mind that nothing but the firmest conviction of the truth of his principles, in 
spite of all appearances, could have withstood. 
This posthumous publication is only a sketch of a much larger work, which he 
proposed should be executed. It necessarily, therefore, wants that detail and 
application which can alone prove the truth of any theory. A few observations will 
be sufficient to show how completely the theory is contradicted when it is applied to 
the real, and not to an imaginary, state of things. 
In the last division of the work, which treats of the future progress of man 
towards perfection, he says, that comparing, in the different civilized nations of 
Europe, the actual population with the extent of territory, and observing their 
cultivation, their industry, their divisions of labour, and their means of subsistence, 
we shall see that it would be impossible to preserve the same means of subsistence, 
and, consequently, the same population, without a number of individuals who have 
no other means of supplying their wants than their industry. Having allowed the 
necessity of such a class of men, and adverting afterwards to the precarious revenue 
of those families that would depend so entirely on the life and health of their chief, 
he says, very justly: >There exists then, a necessary cause of inequality, of 
dependence, and even of misery, which menaces, without ceasing, the most 

numerous and active class of our societies.= (To save time and long quotations, I 
shall here give the substance of some of Mr Condorcet=s sentiments, and hope I shall 
not misrepresent them. But I refer the reader to the work itself, which will amuse, if 
it does not convince him.) The difficulty is just and well stated, and I am afraid that 
the mode by which he proposes it should be removed will be found inefficacious. By 
the application of calculations to the probabilities of life and the interest of money, 
he proposes that a fund should be established which should assure to the old an 
assistance, produced, in part, by their own former savings, and, in part, by the 
savings of individuals who in making the same sacrifice die before they reap the 
benefit of it. The same, or a similar fund, should give assistance to women and 
children who lose their husbands, or fathers, and afford a capital to those who were 
of an age to found a new family, sufficient for the proper development of their 
industry. These establishments, he observes, might be made in the name and under 
the protection of the society. Going still further, he says that, by the just 
application of calculations, means might be found of more completely preserving a 
state of equality, by preventing credit from being the exclusive privilege of great 
fortunes, and yet giving it a basis equally solid, and by rendering the progress of 
industry, and the activity of commerce, less dependent on great capitalists. 
Such establishments and calculations may appear very promising upon paper, 
but when applied to real life they will be found to be absolutely nugatory. Mr 
Condorcet allows that a class of people which maintains itself entirely by industry is 
necessary to every state. Why does he allow this? No other reason can well be 
assigned than that he conceives that the labour necessary to procure subsistence for 
an extended population will not be performed without the goad of necessity. If by 
establishments of this kind of spur to industry be removed, if the idle and the 
negligent are placed upon the same footing with regard to their credit, and the 
future support of their wives and families, as the active and industrious, can we 
expect to see men exert that animated activity in bettering their condition which 
now forms the master spring of public prosperity? If an inquisition were to be 
established to examine the claims of each individual and to determine whether he 
had or had not exerted himself to the utmost, and to grant or refuse assistance 
accordingly, this would be little else than a repetition upon a larger scale of the 
English poor laws and would be completely destructive of the true principles of 
liberty and equality. 
But independent of this great objection to these establishments, and 
supposing for a moment that they would give no check to productive industry, by 
far the greatest difficulty remains yet behind. 
Were every man sure of a comfortable provision for his family, almost every 
man would have one, and were the rising generation free from the >killing frost= of 
misery, population must rapidly increase. Of this Mr Condorcet seems to be fully 
aware himself . . . [But] he then adds: AThere is no person who does not see how 
very distant such a period is from us, but shall we ever arrive at it? It is equally 
impossible to pronounce for or against the future realization of an event which 
cannot take place but at an era when the human race will have attained 
improvements, of which we can at present scarcely form a conception.@ 
Mr Condorcet=s picture of what may be expected to happen when the number 
of men shall surpass the means of their subsistence is justly drawn. The oscillation 
which he describes will certainly take place and will without doubt be a constantly 

subsisting cause of periodical misery. The only point in which I differ from Mr 
Condorcet with regard to this picture is the period when it may be applied to the 
human race. Mr Condorcet thinks that it cannot possibly be applicable but at an era 
extremely distant. If the proportion between the natural increase of population and 
food which I have given be in any degree near the truth, it will appear, on the 
contrary, that the period when the number of men surpass their means of 
subsistence has long since arrived, and that this necessity oscillation, this constantly 
subsisting cause of periodical misery, has existed ever since we have had any 
histories of mankind, does exist at present, and will for ever continue to exist, unless 
some decided change take place in the physical constitution of our nature. 
Mr Condorcet, however, goes on to say that should the period, which he 
conceives to be so distant, ever arrive, the human race, and the advocates for the 
perfectibility of man, need not be alarmed at it. He then proceeds to remove the 
difficulty in a manner which I profess not to understand. Having observed, that the 
ridiculous prejudices of superstition would by that time have ceased to throw over 
morals a corrupt and degrading austerity, he alludes, either to a promiscuous 
concubinage, which would prevent breeding, or to something else as unnatural. To 
remove the difficulty in this way will, surely, in the opinion of most men, be to 
destroy that virtue and purity of manners, which the advocates of equality, and of 
the perfectibility of man, profess to be the end and object of their views. 

CHAPTER 9 
Mr Condorcet=s conjecture concerning the organic perfectibility of man, and the 
indefinite prolongation of human life - Fallacy of the argument, which infers an 
unlimited progress from a partial improvement, the limit of which cannot be 
ascertained, illustrated in the breeding ofanimals, and the cultivation of plants. 

THE last question which Mr Condorcet proposes for examination is the 
organic perfectibility of man. He observes that if the proofs which have been already 
given and which, in their development will receive greater force in the work itself, 
are sufficient to establish the indefinite perfectibility of man upon the supposition of 
the same natural faculties and the same organization which he has at present, what 
will be the certainty, what the extent of our hope, if this organization, these natural 
faculties themselves, are susceptible of amelioration? 
From the improvement of medicine, from the use of more wholesome food and 
habitations, from a manner of living which will improve the strength of the body by 
exercise without impairing it by excess, from the destruction of the two great causes 
of the degradation of man, misery, and too great riches, from the gradual removal of 
transmissible and contagious disorders by the improvement of physical knowledge, 
rendered more efficacious by the progress of reason and of social order, he infers 
that though man will not absolutely become immortal, yet that the duration 
between his birth and natural death will increase without ceasing, will have no 
assignable term, and may properly be expressed by the word >indefinite=. He then 
defines this word to mean either a constant approach to an unlimited extent, 
without ever reaching it, or an increase. In the immensity of ages to an extent 
greater than any assignable quantity. 
But surely the application of this term in either of these senses to the 
duration of human life is in the highest degree unphilosophical and totally 

unwarranted by any appearances in the laws of nature. Variations from different 
causes are essentially distinct from a regular and unretrograde increase. The average 
duration of human life will to a certain degree vary from healthy or unhealthy 
climates, from wholesome or unwholesome food, from virtuous or vicious manners, 
and other causes, but it may be fairly doubted whether there is really the smallest 
perceptible advance in the natural duration of human life since first we have had 
any authentic history of man. The prejudices of all ages have indeed been directly 
contrary to this supposition, and though I would not lay much stress upon these 
prejudices, they will in some measure tend to prove that there has been no marked 
advance in an opposite direction. 
It may perhaps be said that the world is yet so young, so completely in its 
infancy, that it ought not to be expected that any difference should appear so soon. 
If this be the case, there is at once an end of all human science. The whole 
train of reasonings from effects to causes will be destroyed. We may shut our eyes to 
the book of nature, as it will no longer be of any use to read it. The wildest and 
most improbable conjectures may be advanced with as much certainty as the most 
just and sublime theories, founded on careful and reiterated experiments. We may 
return again to the old mode of philosophising and make facts bend to systems, 
instead of establishing systems upon facts. The grand and consistent theory of 
Newton will be placed upon the same footing as the wild and eccentric hypotheses of 
Descartes. In short, if the laws of nature are thus fickle and inconstant, if it can be 
affirmed and be believed that they will change, when for ages and ages they have 
appeared immutable, the human mind will no longer have any incitements to 
inquiry, but must remain fixed in inactive torpor, or amuse itself only in bewildering 
dreams and extravagant fancies. 
The constancy of the laws of nature and of effects and causes is the 
foundation of all human knowledge, though far be it from me to say that the same 
power which framed and executes the laws of nature may not change them all >in a 
moment, in the twinkling of an eye.=  Such a change may undoubtedly happen. All 
that I mean to say is that it is impossible to infer it from reasoning. If without any 
previous observable symptoms or indications of a change, we can infer that a change 
will take place, we may as well make any assertion whatever and think it as 
unreasonable to be contradicted in affirming that the moon will come in contact 
with the earth tomorrow, as in saying that the sun will rise at its usual time. 
With regard to the duration of human life, there does not appear to have 
existed from the earliest ages of the world to the present moment the smallest 
permanent symptom or indication of increasing prolongation. The observable effects 
of climate, habit, diet, and other causes, on length of life have furnished the pretext 
for asserting its indefinite extension; and the sandy foundation on which the 
argument rests is that because the limit of human life is undefined; because you 
cannot mark its precise term, and say so far exactly shall it go and no further; that 
therefore its extent may increase for ever, and be properly termed indefinite or 
unlimited. But the fallacy and absurdity of this argument will sufficiently appear 
from a slight examination of what Mr Condorcet calls the organic perfectibility, or 
degeneration, of the race of plants and animals, which he says may be regarded as 
one of the general laws of nature. 
I am told that it is a maxim among the improvers of cattle that you may 
breed to any degree of nicety you please, and they found this maxim upon another, 

which is that some of the offspring will possess the desirable qualities of the parents 
in a greater degree. In the famous Leicestershire breed of sheep, the object is to 
procure them with small heads and small legs. Proceeding upon these breeding 
maxims, it is evident that we might go on till the heads and legs were evanescent 
quantities, but this is so palpable an absurdity that we may be quite sure that the 
premises are not just and that there really is a limit, though we cannot see it or say 
exactly where it is. In this case, the point of the greatest degree of improvement, or 
the smallest size of the head and legs, may be said to be undefined, but this is very 
different from unlimited, or from indefinite, in Mr Condorcet=s acceptation of the 
term. Though I may not be able in the present instance to mark the limit at which 
further improvement will stop, I can very easily mention a point at which it will not 
arrive. I should not scruple to assert that were the breeding to continue for ever, 
the head and legs of these sheep would never be so small as the head and legs of a 
rat. 

It cannot be true, therefore, that among animals, some of the offspring will 
possess the desirable qualities of the parents in a greater degree, or that animals are 
indefinitely perfectible. 
The progress of a wild plant to a beautiful garden flower is perhaps more 
marked and striking than anything that takes place among animals, yet even here it 
would be the height of absurdity to assert that the progress was unlimited or 
indefinite. 
One of the most obvious features of the improvement is the increase of size. 
The flower has grown gradually larger by cultivation. If the progress were really 
unlimited it might be increased ad infinitum, but this is so gross an absurdity that 
we may be quite sure that among plants as well as among animals there is a limit to 
improvement, though we do not exactly know where it is. It is probable that the 
gardeners who contend for flower prizes have often applied stronger dressing 
without success. At the same time it would be highly presumptuous in any man to 
say that he had seen the finest carnation or anemone that could ever be made to 
grow. He might however assert without the smallest chance of being contradicted by 
a future fact, that no carnation or anemone could ever by cultivation be increased to 
the size of a large cabbage; and yet there are assignable quantities much greater 
than a cabbage. No man can say that he has seen the largest ear of wheat, or the 
largest oak that could ever grow; but he might easily, and with perfect certainty, 
name a point of magnitude at which they would not arrive. In all these cases 
therefore, a careful distinction should be made, between an unlimited progress, and 
a progress where the limit is merely undefined. 
It will be said, perhaps, that the reason why plants and animals cannot 
increase indefinitely in size is, that they would fall by their own weight. I answer, 
how do we know this but from experience? -- from experience of the degree of 
strength with which these bodies are formed. I know that a carnation, long before it 
reached the size of a cabbage, would not be supported by its stalk, but I only know 
this from my experience of the weakness and want of tenacity in the materials of a 
carnation stalk. There are many substances in nature of the same size that would 
support as large a head as a cabbage. 
The reasons of the mortality of plants are at present perfectly unknown to us. 
No man can say why such a plant is annual, another biennial, and another endures 
for ages. The whole affair in all these cases, in plants, animals, and in the human 

race, is an affair of experience, and I only conclude that man is mortal because the 
invariable experience of all ages has proved the mortality of those materials of which 
his visible body is made: AWhat can we reason, but from what we know?@ 
Sound philosophy will not authorize me to alter this opinion of the mortality 
of man on earth, till it can be clearly proved that the human race has made, and is 
making, a decided progress towards an illimitable extent of life. And the chief reason 
why I adduced the two particular instances from animals and plants was to expose 
and illustrate, if I could, the fallacy of that argument which infers an unlimited 
progress, merely because some partial improvement has taken place, and that the 
limit of this improvement cannot be precisely ascertained. 
The capacity of improvement in plants and animals, to a certain degree, no 
person can possibly doubt. A clear and decided progress has already been made, and 
yet, I think, it appears that it would be highly absurd to say that this progress has 
no limits. In human life, though there are great variations from different causes, it 
may be doubted whether, since the world began, any organic improvement whatever 
in the human frame can be clearly ascertained. The foundations, therefore, on which 
the arguments for the organic perfectibility of man rest, are unusually weak, and 
can only be considered as mere conjectures. It does not, however, by any means 
seem impossible that by an attention to breed, a certain degree of improvement, 
similar to that among animals, might take place among men. Whether intellect 
could be communicated may be a matter of doubt: but size, strength, beauty, 
complexion, and perhaps even longevity are in a degree transmissible. The error 
does not seem to lie in supposing a small degree of improvement possible, but in not 
discriminating between a small improvement, the limit of which is undefined, and an 
improvement really unlimited. As the human race, however, could not be improved 
in this way, without condemning all the bad specimens to celibacy, it is not probable 
that an attention to breed should ever become general; indeed, I know of no 
well-directed attempts of this kind, except in the ancient family of the Bickerstaffs, 
who are said to have been very successful in whitening the skins and increasing the 
height of their race by prudent marriages, particularly by that very judicious cross 
with Maud, the milk-maid, by which some capital defects in the constitutions of the 
family were corrected. 
It will not be necessary, I think, in order more completely to show the 
improbability of any approach in man towards immortality on earth, to urge the 
very great additional weight that an increase in the duration of life would give to 
the argument of population. 
Many, I doubt not, will think that the attempting gravely to controvert so 
absurd a paradox as the immortality of man on earth, or indeed, even the 
perfectibility of man and society, is a waste of time and words, and that such 
unfounded conjectures are best answered by neglect. I profess, however, to be of a 
different opinion. When paradoxes of this kind are advanced by ingenious and able 
men, neglect has no tendency to convince them of their mistakes. Priding 
themselves on what they conceive to be a mark of the reach and size of their own 
understandings, of the extent and comprehensiveness of their views, they will look 
upon this neglect merely as an indication of poverty, and narrowness, in the mental 
exertions of their contemporaries, and only think that the world is not yet prepared 
to receive their sublime truths. 

On the contrary, a candid investigation of these subjects, accompanied with a 
perfect readiness to adopt any theory warranted by sound philosophy, may have a 
tendency to convince them that in forming improbable and unfounded hypotheses, 
so far from enlarging the bounds of human science, they are contracting it, so far 
from promoting the improvement of the human mind, they are obstructing it; they 
are throwing us back again almost into the infancy of knowledge and weakening the 
foundations of that mode of philosophising, under the auspices of which science has 
of late made such rapid advances. The present rage for wide and unrestrained 
speculation seems to be a kind of mental intoxication, arising, perhaps, from the 
great and unexpected discoveries which have been made of late years, in various 
branches of science. To men elate and giddy with such successes, every thing 
appeared to be within the grasp of human powers; and, under this illusion, they 
confounded subjects where no real progress could be proved with those where the 
progress had been marked, certain, and acknowledged. Could they be persuaded to 
sober themselves with a little severe and chastised thinking, they would see, that 
the cause of truth, and of sound philosophy, cannot but suffer by substituting wild 
flights and unsupported assertions for patient investigation, and well authenticated 
proofs. 
Mr Condorcet=s book may be considered not only as a sketch of the opinions 
of a celebrated individual, but of many of the literary men in France at the 
beginning of the Revolution. As such, though merely a sketch, it seems worthy of 
attention. 

CHAPTER 10 
Mr Godwin=s system of equality - Error of attributing all the vices of mankind to 
human institutions - Mr Godwin=s first answer to the difficulty arising from 
populationtotally insufficient - Mr Godwin=s beautiful system of equality supposed 
to be realized - In utter destruction simply from the principle of population in so 
short a time as thirty years. 

IN reading Mr Godwin=s ingenious and able work on Political Justice, it is 
impossible not to be struck with the spirit and energy of his style, the force and 
precision of some of his reasonings, the ardent tone of his thoughts, and particularly 
with that impressive earnestness of manner which gives an air of truth to the whole. 
At the same time, it must be confessed that he has not proceeded in his inquiries 
with the caution that sound philosophy seems to require. His conclusions are often 
unwarranted by his premises. He fails sometimes in removing the objections which 
he himself brings forward. He relies too much on general and abstract propositions 
which will not admit of application. And his conjectures certainly far outstrip the 
modesty of nature. 
The system of equality which Mr Godwin proposes is, without doubt, by far 
the most beautiful and engaging of any that has yet appeared. An amelioration of 
society to be produced merely by reason and conviction wears much more the 
promise of permanence than any change effected and maintained by force. The 
unlimited exercise of private judgement is a doctrine inexpressibly grand and 
captivating and has a vast superiority over those systems where every individual is 
in a manner the slave of the public. The substitution of benevolence as the 
master-spring and moving principle of society, instead of self-love, is a 

consummation devoutly to be wished. In short, it is impossible to contemplate the 
whole of this fair structure without emotions of delight and admiration, 
accompanied with ardent longing for the period of its accomplishment. But, alas! 
that moment can never arrive. The whole is little better than a dream, a beautiful 
phantom of the imagination. These >gorgeous palaces= of happiness and immortality, 
these >solemn temples= of truth and virtue will dissolve, >like the baseless fabric of a 
vision=, when we awaken to real life and contemplate the true and genuine situation 
of man on earth. Mr Godwin, at the conclusion of the thirdCHAPTER of his eighth 
book, speaking of population, says: 

    There is a principle in human society, by which population is perpetually kept 
down to the level of the means of subsistence. Thus among the wandering tribes of 
America and Asia, we never find through the lapse of ages that population has so 
increased as to render necessary the cultivation of the earth. 

    This principle, which Mr Godwin thus mentions as some mysterious and occult 
cause and which he does not attempt to investigate, will be found to be the grinding 
law of necessity, misery, and the fear of misery. 
The great error under which Mr Godwin labours throughout his whole work is the 
attributing almost all the vices and misery that are seen in civil society to human 
institutions. Political regulations and the established administration of property are 
with him the fruitful sources of all evil, the hotbeds of all the crimes that degrade 
mankind. Were this really a true state of the case, it would not seem a hopeless task 
to remove evil completely from the world, and reason seems to be the proper and 
adequate instrument for effecting so great a purpose. But the truth is, that though 
human institutions appear to be the obvious and obtrusive causes of much mischief 
to mankind, yet in reality they are light and superficial, they are mere feathers that 
float on the surface, in comparison with those deeper seated causes of impurity that 
corrupt the springs and render turbid the whole stream of human life. 
Mr Godwin, in his chapter on the benefits attendant on a system of equality, 

says: 

    The spirit of oppression, the spirit of servility, and the spirit of fraud, 
these are the immediate growth of the established administration of 
property. They are alike hostile to intellectual improvement. The other vices 
of envy, malice, and revenge are their inseparable companions. In a state 
of society where men lived in the midst of plenty and where all shared alike 
the bounties of nature, these sentiments would inevitably expire. The 
narrow principle of selfishness would vanish. No man being obliged to 
guard his little store or provide with anxiety and pain for his restless wants, 
each would lose his individual existence in the thought of the general good. 
No man would be an enemy to his neighbour, for they would have no 
subject of contention, and, of consequence, philanthropy would resume the 
empire which reason assigns her. Mind would be delivered from her 
perpetual anxiety about corporal support, and free to expatiate in the field 
of thought, which is congenial to her. Each would assist the inquiries of all. 

    This would, indeed, be a happy state. But that it is merely an imaginary picture, 
with scarcely a feature near the truth, the reader, I am afraid, is already too well 
convinced. 
Man cannot live in the midst of plenty. All cannot share alike the bounties of 
nature. Were there no established administration of property, every man would be 
obliged to guard with force his little store. Selfishness would be triumphant. The 
subjects of contention would be perpetual. Every individual mind would be under a 
constant anxiety about corporal support, and not a single intellect would be left free 
to expatiate in the field of thought. 
How little Mr Godwin has turned the attention of his penetrating mind to the 
real state of man on earth will sufficiently appear from the manner in which he 
endeavours to remove the difficulty of an overcharged population. He says: AThe 
obvious answer to this objection, is, that to reason thus is to foresee difficulties at a 
great distance. Three fourths of the habitable globe is now uncultivated. The parts 
already cultivated are capable of immeasurable improvement. Myriads of centuries 
of still increasing population may pass away, and the earth be still found sufficient 
for the subsistence of its inhabitants.@ 
I have already pointed out the error of supposing that no distress and 
difficulty would arise from an overcharged population before the earth absolutely 
refused to produce any more. But let us imagine for a moment Mr Godwin=s 
beautiful system of equality realized in its utmost purity, and see how soon this 
difficulty might be expected to press under so perfect a form of society. A theory 
that will not admit of application cannot possibly be just. 
Let us suppose all the causes of misery and vice in this island removed. War 
and contention cease. Unwholesome trades and manufactories do not exist. Crowds 
no longer collect together in great and pestilent cities for purposes of court intrigue, 
of commerce, and vicious gratifications. Simple, healthy, and rational amusements 
take place of drinking, gaming, and debauchery. There are no towns sufficiently 
large to have any prejudicial effects on the human constitution. The greater part of 
the happy inhabitants of this terrestrial paradise live in hamlets and farmhouses 
scattered over the face of the country. Every house is clean, airy, sufficiently roomy, 
and in a healthy situation. All men are equal. The labours of luxury are at end. And 
the necessary labours of agriculture are shared amicably among all. The number of 
persons, and the produce of the island, we suppose to be the same as at present. 
The spirit of benevolence, guided by impartial justice, will divide this produce 
among all the members of the society according to their wants. Though it would be 
impossible that they should all have animal food every day, yet vegetable food, with 
meat occasionally, would satisfy the desires of a frugal people and would be 
sufficient to preserve them in health, strength, and spirits. 
Mr Godwin considers marriage as a fraud and a monopoly. Let us suppose the 
commerce of the sexes established upon principles of the most perfect freedom. Mr 
Godwin does not think himself that this freedom would lead to a promiscuous 
intercourse, and in this I perfectly agree with him. The love of variety is a vicious, 
corrupt, and unnatural taste and could not prevail in any great degree in a simple 
and virtuous state of society. Each man would probably select himself a partner, to 
whom he would adhere as long as that adherence continued to be the choice of both 
parties. It would be of little consequence, according to Mr Godwin, how many 
children a woman had or to whom they belonged. Provisions and assistance would 

spontaneously flow from the quarter in which they abounded, to the quarter that 
was deficient. And every man would be ready to furnish instruction to the rising 
generation according to his capacity. 
I cannot conceive a form of society so favourable upon the whole to 
population. The irremediableness of marriage, as it is at present constituted, 
undoubtedly deters many from entering into that state. An unshackled intercourse 
on the contrary would be a most powerful incitement to early attachments, and as 
we are supposing no anxiety about the future support of children to exist, I do not 
conceive that there would be one woman in a hundred, of twenty-three, without a 
family. 
With these extraordinary encouragements to population, and every cause of 
depopulation, as we have supposed, removed, the numbers would necessarily 
increase faster than in any society that has ever yet been known. . . . Alas! what 
becomes of the picture where men lived in the midst of plenty, where no man was 
obliged to provide with anxiety and pain for his restless wants, where the narrow 
principle of selfishness did not exist, where Mind was delivered from her perpetual 
anxiety about corporal support and free to expatiate in the field of thought which is 
congenial to her. This beautiful fabric of imagination vanishes at the severe touch of 
truth. The spirit of benevolence, cherished and invigorated by plenty, is repressed 
by the chilling breath of want. The hateful passions that had vanished reappear. The 
mighty law of self-preservation expels all the softer and more exalted emotions of 
the soul. The temptations to evil are too strong for human nature to resist. The 
corn is plucked before it is ripe, or secreted in unfair proportions, and the whole 
black train of vices that belong to falsehood are immediately generated. Provisions 
no longer flow in for the support of the mother with a large family. The children are 
sickly from insufficient food. The rosy flush of health gives place to the pallid cheek 
and hollow eye of misery. Benevolence, yet lingering in a few bosoms, makes some 
faint expiring struggles, till at length self-love resumes his wonted empire and lords 
it triumphant over the world. . . . 
It is a perfectly just observation of Mr Godwin, that, >There is a principle in 
human society, by which population is perpetually kept down to the level of the 
means of subsistence.= The sole question is, what is this principle? is it some obscure 
and occult cause? Is it some mysterious interference of heaven which, at a certain 
period, strikes the men with impotence, and the women with barrenness? Or is it a 
cause, open to our researches, within our view, a cause, which has constantly been 
observed to operate, though with varied force, in every state in which man has been 
placed? Is it not a degree of misery, the necessary and inevitable result of the laws 
of nature, which human institutions, so far from aggravating, have tended 
considerably to mitigate, though they never can remove? 
It may be curious to observe, in the case that we have been supposing, how 
some of the laws which at present govern civilized society, would be successively 
dictated by the most imperious necessity. As man, according to Mr Godwin, is the 
creature of the impressions to which he is subject, the goadings of want could not 
continue long, before some violations of public or private stock would necessarily 
take place. As these violations increased in number and extent, the more active and 
comprehensive intellects of the society would soon perceive, that while population 
was fast increasing, the yearly produce of the country would shortly begin to 
diminish. The urgency of the case would suggest the necessity of some mediate 

measures to be taken for the general safety. Some kind of convention would then be 
called, and the dangerous situation of the country stated in the strongest terms. It 
would be observed, that while they lived in the midst of plenty, it was of little 
consequence who laboured the least, or who possessed the least, as every man was 
perfectly willing and ready to supply the wants of his neighbour. But that the 
question was no longer whether one man should give to another that which he did 
not use himself, but whether he should give to his neighbour the food which was 
absolutely necessary to his own existence. It would be represented, that the number 
of those that were in want very greatly exceeded the number and means of those 
who should supply them; that these pressing wants, which from the state of the 
produce of the country could not all be gratified, had occasioned some flagrant 
violations of justice; that these violations had already checked the increase of food, 
and would, if they were not by some means or other prevented, throw the whole 
community in confusion; that imperious necessity seemed to dictate that a yearly 
increase of produce should, if possible, be obtained at all events; that in order to 
effect this first, great, and indispensable purpose, it would be advisable to make a 
more complete division of land, and to secure every man=s stock against violation by 
the most powerful sanctions, even by death itself. 
It might be urged perhaps by some objectors that, as the fertility of the land 
increased, and various accidents occurred, the share of some men might be much 
more than sufficient for their support, and that when the reign of self-love was once 
established, they would not distribute their surplus produce without some 
compensation in return. It would be observed, in answer, that this was an 
inconvenience greatly to be lamented; but that it was an evil which bore no 
comparison to the black train of distresses that would inevitably be occasioned by 
the insecurity of property; that the quantity of food which one man could consume 
was necessarily limited by the narrow capacity of the human stomach; that it was 
not certainly probable that he should throw away the rest; but that even if he 
exchanged his surplus food for the labour of others, and made them in some degree 
dependent on him, this would still be better than that these others should 
absolutely starve. 
It seems highly probable, therefore, that an administration of property, not 
very different from that which prevails in civilized states at present, would be 
established, as the best, though inadequate, remedy for the evils which were 
pressing on the society. 
The next subject that would come under discussion, intimately connected 
with the preceding, is the commerce between the sexes. It would be urged by those 
who had turned their attention to the true cause of the difficulties under which the 
community laboured, that while every man felt secure that all his children would be 
well provided for by general benevolence, the powers of the earth would be 
absolutely inadequate to produce food for the population which would inevitably 
ensue; that even if the whole attention and labour of the society were directed to 
this sole point, and if, by the most perfect security of property, and every other 
encouragement that could be thought of, the greatest possible increase of produce 
were yearly obtained; yet still, that the increase of food would by no means keep 
pace with the much more rapid increase of population; that some check to 
population therefore was imperiously called for; that the most natural and obvious 
check seemed to be to make every man provide for his own children; that this would 

operate in some respect as a measure and guide in the increase of population, as it 
might be expected that no man would bring beings into the world, for whom he 
could not find the means of support; that where this notwithstanding was the case, 
it seemed necessary, for the example of others, that the disgrace and inconvenience 
attending such a conduct should fall upon the individual, who had thus 
inconsiderately plUnged himself and innocent children in misery and want. 
The institution of marriage, or at least, of some express or implied obligation 
on every man to support his own children, seems to be the natural result of these 
reasonings in a community under the difficulties that we have supposed. 
The view of these difficulties presents us with a very natural origin of the 
superior disgrace which attends a breach of chastity in the woman than in the man. 
It could not be expected that women should have resources sufficient to support 
their own children. When therefore a woman was connected with a man, who had 
entered into no compact to maintain her children, and, aware of the inconveniences 
that he might bring upon himself, had deserted her, these children must necessarily 
fall for support upon the society, or starve. And to prevent the frequent recurrence 
of such an inconvenience, as it would be highly unjust to punish so natural a fault 
by personal restraint or infliction, the men might agree to punish it with disgrace. 
The offence is besides more obvious and conspicuous in the woman, and less liable to 
any mistake. The father of a child may not always be known, but the same 
uncertainty cannot easily exist with regard to the mother. Where the evidence of 
the offence was most complete, and the inconvenience to the society at the same 
time the greatest, there it was agreed that the large share of blame should fall. The 
obligation on every man to maintain his children, the society would enforce, if there 
were occasion; and the greater degree of inconvenience or labour, to which a family 
would necessarily subject him, added to some portion of disgrace which every 
human being must incur who leads another into unhappiness, might be considered 
as a sufficient punishment for the man. 
That a woman should at present be almost driven from society for an offence 
which men commit nearly with impunity, seems to be undoubtedly a breach of 
natural justice. But the origin of the custom, as the most obvious and effectual 
method of preventing the frequent recurrence of a serious inconvenience to a 
community, appears to be natural, though not perhaps perfectly justifiable. This 
origin, however, is now lost in the new train of ideas which the custom has since 
generated. What at first might be dictated by state necessity is now supported by 
female delicacy, and operates with the greatest force on that part of society where, if 
the original intention of the custom were preserved, there is the least real occasion 
for it. 

When these two fundamental laws of society, the security of property, and 
the institution of marriage, were once established, inequality of conditions must 
necessarily follow. Those who were born after the division of property would come 
into a world already possessed. If their parents, from having too large a family, 
could not give them sufficient for their support, what are they to do in a world 
where everything is appropriated? We have seen the fatal effects that would result 
to a society, if every man had a valid claim to an equal share of the produce of the 
earth. The members of a family which was grown too large for the original division 
of land appropriated to it could not then demand a part of the surplus produce of 
others, as a debt of justice. It has appeared, that from the inevitable laws of our 

nature some human beings must suffer from want. These are the unhappy persons 
who, in the great lottery of life, have drawn a blank. The number of these claimants 
would soon exceed the ability of the surplus produce to supply. Moral merit is a 
very difficult distinguishing criterion, except in extreme cases. The owners of surplus 
produce would in general seek some more obvious mark of distinction. And it seems 
both natural and just that, except upon particular occasions, their choice should fall 
upon those who were able, and professed themselves willing, to exert their strength 
in procuring a further surplus produce; and thus at once benefiting the community, 
and enabling these proprietors to afford assistance to greater numbers. All who were 
in want of food would be urged by imperious necessity to offer their labour in 
exchange for this article so absolutely essential to existence. The fund appropriated 
to the maintenance of labour would be the aggregate quantity of food possessed by 
the owners of land beyond their own consumption. When the demands upon this 
fund were great and numerous, it would naturally be divided in very small shares. 
Labour would be ill paid. Men would offer to work for a bare subsistence, and the 
rearing of families would be checked by sickness and misery. On the contrary, when 
this fund was increasing fast, when it was great in proportion to the number of 
claimants, it would be divided in much larger shares. No man would exchange his 
labour without receiving an ample quantity of food in return. Labourers would live 
in ease and comfort, and would consequently be able to rear a numerous and 
vigorous offspring. 
On the state of this fund, the happiness, or the degree of misery, prevailing 
among the lower classes of people in every known state at present chiefly depends. 
And on this happiness, or degree of misery, depends the increase, stationariness, or 
decrease of population. 
And thus it appears, that a society constituted according to the most 
beautiful form that imagination can conceive, with benevolence for its moving 
principle, instead of self-love, and with every evil disposition in all its members 
corrected by reason and not force, would, from the inevitable laws of nature, and 
not from any original depravity of man, in a very short period degenerate into a 
society constructed upon a plan not essentially different from that which prevails in 
every known state at present; I mean, a society divided into a class of proprietors, 
and a class of labourers, and with self-love the main-spring of the great machine. . . . 

from CHAPTERS 11 through 17 

WE have supported Mr Godwin=s system of society once completely established. But 
it is supposing an impossibility. The same causes in nature which would destroy it 
so rapidly, were it once established, would prevent the possibility of its 
establishment. And upon what grounds we can presume a change in these natural 
causes, I am utterly at a loss to conjecture. No move towards the extinction of the 
passion between the sexes has taken place in the five or six thousand years that the 
world has existed. Men in the decline of life have in all ages declaimed against a 
passion which they have ceased to feel, but with as little reason as success. Those 
who from coldness of constitutional temperament have never felt what love is, will 
surely be allowed to be very incompetent judges with regard to the power of this 
passion to contribute to the sum of pleasurable sensations in life. Those who have 
spent their youth in criminal excesses and have prepared for themselves, as the 

comforts of their age, corporeal debility and mental remorse may well inveigh 
against such pleasures as vain and futile, and unproductive of lasting satisfaction. 
But the pleasures of pure love will bear the contemplation of the most improved 
reason, and the most exalted virtue. Perhaps there is scarcely a man who has once 
experienced the genuine delight of virtuous love, however great his intellectual 
pleasure may have been, that does not look back to the period as the sunny spot in 
his whole life, where his imagination loves to bask, which he recollects and 
contemplates with the fondest regrets, and which he would most wish to live over 
again. The superiority of intellectual to sensual pleasures consists rather in their 
filling up more time, in their having a larger range, and in their being less liable to 
satiety, than in their being more real and essential. . . . 
Mr Godwin says, in order to show the evident inferiority of the pleasures of 
sense, AStrip the commerce of the sexes of all its attendant circumstances, and it 
would be generally despised@. He might as well say to a man who admired trees: 
strip them of their spreading branches and lovely foliage, and what beauty can you 
see in a bare pole? But it was the tree with the branches and foliage, and not 
without them, that excited admiration. One feature of an object may be as distinct, 
and excite as different emotions, from the aggregate as any two things the most 
remote, as a beautiful woman, and a map of Madagascar. It is >the symmetry of 
person, the vivacity, the voluptuous softness of temper, the affectionate kindness of 
feelings, the imagination and the wit=  of a woman that excite the passion of love, and 
not the mere distinction of her being female. Urged by the passion of love, men have 
been driven into acts highly prejudicial to the general interests of society, but 
probably they would have found no difficulty in resisting the temptation, had it 
appeared in the form of a woman with no other attractions whatever but her sex. 
To strip sensual pleasures of all their adjuncts, in order to prove their inferiority, is 
to deprive a magnet of some of its most essential causes of attraction, and then to 
say that it is weak and inefficient. 
In the pursuit of every enjoyment, whether sensual or intellectual, reason, 
that faculty which enables us to calculate consequences, is the proper corrective and 
guide. It is probable therefore that improved reason will always tend to prevent the 
abuse of sensual pleasures, though it by no means follows that it will extinguish 
them. . . . But allowing, as I should be inclined to do, notwithstanding numerous 
instances to the contrary, that great intellectual exertions tend to diminish the 
empire of this passion over man, it is evident that the mass of mankind must be 
improved more highly than the brightest ornaments of the species at present before 
any difference can take place sufficient sensibly to affect population. I would by no 
means suppose that the mass of mankind has reached its term of improvement, but 
the principal argument of this essay tends to place in a strong point of view the 
improbability that the lower classes of people in any country should ever be 
sufficiently free from want and labour to obtain any high degree of intellectual 
improvement. . . . 
I cannot quit this subject without taking notice of these conjectures of Mr 
Godwin and Mr Condorcet concerning the indefinite prolongation of human life, as a 
very curious instance of the longing of the soul after immortality. Both these 
gentlemen have rejected the light of revelation which absolutely promises eternal life 
in another state. They have also rejected the light of natural religion, which to the 
ablest intellects in all ages has indicated the future existence of the soul. Yet so 

congenial is the idea of immortality to the mind of man that they cannot consent 
entirely to throw it out of their systems. After all their fastidious scepticisms 
concerning the only probable mode of immortality, they introduce a species of 
immortality of their own, not only completely contradictory to every law of 
philosophical probability, but in itself in the highest degree narrow, partial, and 
unjust. They suppose that all the great, virtuous, and exalted minds that have ever 
existed or that may exist for some thousands, perhaps millions of years, will be sunk 
in annihilation, and that only a few beings, not greater in number than can exist at 
once upon the earth, will be ultimately crowned with immortality. Had such a tenet 
been advanced as a tenet of revelation I am very sure that all the enemies of 
religion, and probably Mr Godwin and Mr Condorcet among the rest, would have 
exhausted the whole force of their ridicule upon it, as the most puerile, the most 
absurd, the poorest, the most pitiful, the most iniquitously unjust, and, 
consequently, the most unworthy of the Deity that the superstitious folly of man 
could invent. 
What a strange and curious proof do these conjectures exhibit of the 
inconsistency of scepticism! For it should be observed, that there is a very striking 
and essential difference between believing an assertion which absolutely contradicts 
the most uniform experience, and an assertion which contradicts nothing, but is 
merely beyond the power of our present observation and knowledge. So diversified 
are the natural objects around us, so many instances of mighty power daily offer 
themselves to our view, that we may fairly presume, that there are many forms and 
operations of nature which we have not yet observed, or which, perhaps, we are not 
capable of observing with our present confined inlets of knowledge. The resurrection 
of a spiritual body from a natural body does not appear in itself a more wonderful 
instance of power than the germination of a blade of wheat from the grain, or of an 
oak from an acorn. Could we conceive an intelligent being, so placed as to be 
conversant only with inanimate or full grown objects, and never to have witnessed 
the process of vegetation and growth; and were another being to show him two little 
pieces of matter, a grain of wheat, and an acorn, to desire him to examine them, to 
analyse them if he pleased, and endeavour to find out their properties and essences; 
and then to tell him, that however trifling these little bits of matter might appear to 
him, that they possessed such curious powers of selection, combination, 
arrangement, and almost of creation, that upon being put into the ground, they 
would choose, amongst all the dirt and moisture that surrounded them, those parts 
which best suited their purpose, that they would collect and arrange these parts 
with wonderful taste, judgement, and execution, and would rise up into beautiful 
forms, scarcely in any respect analogous to the little bits of matter which were first 
placed in the earth. I feel very little doubt that the imaginary being which I have 
supposed would hesitate more, would require better authority, and stronger proofs, 
before he believed these strange assertions, than if he had been told, that a being of 
mighty power, who had been the cause of all that he saw around him, and of that 
existence of which he himself was conscious, would, by a great act of power upon 
the death and corruption of human creatures, raise up the essence of thought in an 
incorporeal, or at least invisible form, to give it a happier existence in another state. 
The only difference, with regard to our own apprehensions, that is not in 
favour of the latter assertion is that the first miracle we have repeatedly seen, and 
the last miracle we have not seen. The powers of selection, combination, and 

transmutation, which every seed shows, are truly miraculous. Who can imagine that 
these wonderful faculties are contained in these little bits of matter? To me it 
appears much more philosophical to suppose that the mighty God of nature is 
present in full energy in all these operations. To this all powerful Being, it would be 
equally easy to raise an oak without an acorn as with one. The preparatory process 
of putting seeds into the ground is merely ordained for the use of man, as one 
among the various other excitements necessary to awaken matter into mind. It is an 
idea that will be found consistent, equally with the natural phenomena around us, 
with the various events of human life, and with the successive revelations of God to 
man, to suppose that the world is a mighty process for the creation and formation of 
mind. Many vessels will necessarily come out of this great furnace in wrong shapes. 
These will be broken and thrown aside as useless; while those vessels whose forms 
are full of truth, grace, and loveliness, will be wafted into happier situations, nearer 
the presence of the mighty maker. . . . 
Mr Godwin considers man too much in the light of a being merely 
intellectual. This error, at least such I conceive it to be, pervades his whole work 
and mixes itself with all his reasonings. The voluntary actions of men may originate 
in their opinions, but these opinions will be very differently modified in creatures 
compounded of a rational faculty and corporal propensities from what they would be 
in beings wholly intellectual. Mr Godwin, in proving that sound reasoning and truth 
are capable of being adequately communicated, examines the proposition first 
practically, and then adds, >Such is the appearance which this proposition assumes, 
when examined in a loose and practical view. In strict consideration it will not 
admit of debate. Man is a rational being, etc.= So far from calling this a strict 
consideration of the subject, I own I should call it the loosest, and most erroneous, 
way possible, of considering it. It is the calculating the velocity of a falling body in 
vacuo, and persisting in it, that it would be the same through whatever resisting 
mediums it might fall. This was not Newton=s mode of philosophizing. Very few 
general propositions are just in application to a particular subject. The moon is not 
kept in her orbit round the earth, nor the earth in her orbit round the sun, by a 
force that varies merely in the inverse ratio of the squares of the distances. To make 
the general theory just in application to the revolutions of these bodies, it was 
necessary to calculate accurately the disturbing force of the sun upon the moon, and 
of the moon upon the earth; and till these disturbing forces were properly estimated, 
actual observations on the motions of these bodies would have proved that the 
theory was not accurately true. . . . 
Man, according to Mr Godwin, is a creature formed what he is by the 
successive impressions which he has received, from the first moment that the germ 
from which he sprung was animated. Could he be placed in a situation, where he 
was subject to no evil impressions whatever, though it might be doubted whether in 
such a situation virtue could exist, vice would certainly be banished. The great bent 
of Mr Godwin=s work on Political Justice, if I understand it rightly, is to show that 
the greater part of the vices and weaknesses of men proceed from the injustice of 
their political and social institutions, and that if these were removed and the 
understandings of men more enlightened, there would be little or no temptation in 
the world to evil. As it has been clearly proved, however, (at least as I think) that 
this is entirely a false conception, and that, independent of any political or social 
institutions whatever, the greater part of mankind, from the fixed and unalterable 

laws of nature, must ever be subject to the evil temptations arising from want, 
besides other passions, it follows from Mr Godwin=s definition of man that such 
impressions, and combinations of impressions, cannot be afloat in the world without 
generating a variety of bad men. According to Mr Godwin=s own conception of the 
formation of character, it is surely as improbable that under such circumstances all 
men will be virtuous as that sixes will come up a hundred times following upon the 
dice. . . . 
The lower classes of people in Europe may at some future period be much 
better instructed than they are at present; they may be taught to employ the little 
spare time they have in many better ways than at the ale-house; they may live 
under better and more equal laws than they have ever hitherto done, perhaps, in 
any country; and I even conceive it possible, though not probable that they may 
have more leisure; but it is not in the nature of things that they can be awarded 
such a quantity of money or subsistence as will allow them all to marry early, in the 
full confidence that they shall be able to provide with ease for a numerous family. . . 
. 

It has appeared that a society constituted according to Mr Godwin=s system 
must, from the inevitable laws of our nature, degenerate into a class of proprietors 
and a class of labourers, and that the substitution of benevolence for self-love as the 
moving principle of society, instead of producing the happy effects that might be 
expected from so fair a name, would cause the same pressure of want to be felt by 
the whole of society, which is now felt only by a part. It is to the established 
administration of property and to the apparently narrow principle of self-love that 
we are indebted for all the noblest exertions of human genius, all the finer and more 
delicate emotions of the soul, for everything, indeed, that distinguishes the civilized 
from the savage state; and no sufficient change has as yet taken place in the nature 
of civilized man to enable us to say that he either is, or ever will be, in a state when 
he may safely throw down the ladder by which he has risen to this eminence. . . . 
The labour created by luxuries, though useful in distributing the produce of 
the country, without vitiating the proprietor by power, or debasing the labourer by 
dependence, has not, indeed, the same beneficial effects on the state of the poor. A 
great accession of work from manufacturers, though it may raise the price of labour 
even more than an increasing demand for agricultural labour, yet, as in this case the 
quantity of food in the country may not be proportionably increasing, the advantage 
to the poor will be but temporary, as the price of provisions must necessarily rise in 
proportion to the price of labour. Relative to this subject, I cannot avoid venturing 
a few remarks on a part of Dr Adam Smith=s Wealth of Nations, speaking at the 
same time with that diffidence which I ought certainly to feel in differing from a 
person so justly celebrated in the political world. . . . 
A question seems naturally to arise here whether the exchangeable value of 
the annual produce of the land and labour be the proper definition of the wealth of 
a country, or whether the gross produce of the land, according to the French 
economists, may not be a more accurate definition. Certain it is that every increase 
of wealth, according to the definition of the economists, will be an increase of the 
funds for the maintenance of labour, and consequently will always tend to 
ameliorate the condition of the labouring poor, though an increase of wealth, 
according to Dr Adam Smith=s definition, will by no means invariably have the same 
tendency. And yet it may not follow from this consideration that Dr Adam Smith=s 

definition is not just. It seems in many respects improper to exclude the clothing 
and lodging of a whole people from any part of their revenue. Much of it may, 
indeed, be of very trivial and unimportant value in comparison with the food of the 
country, yet still it may be fairly considered as a part of its revenue; and, therefore, 
the only point in which I should differ from Dr Adam Smith is where he seems to 
consider every increase of the revenue or stock of a society as an increase of the 
funds for the maintenance of labour, and consequently as tending always to 
ameliorate the condition of the poor. 
The fine silks and cottons, the laces, and other ornamental luxuries of a rich 
country, may contribute very considerably to augment the exchangeable value of its 
annual produce; yet they contribute but in a very small degree to augment the mass 
of happiness in the society, and it appears to me that it is with some view to the 
real utility of the produce that we ought to estimate the productiveness or 
unproductiveness of different sorts of labour. The French economists consider all 
labour employed in manufactures as unproductive. Comparing it with the labour 
employed upon land, I should be perfectly disposed to agree with them, but not 
exactly for the reasons which they give. They say that labour employed upon land is 
productive because the produce, over and above completely paying the labourer and 
the farmer, affords a clear rent to the landlord, and that the labour employed upon 
a piece of lace is unproductive because it merely replaces the provisions that the 
workman had consumed, and the stock of his employer, without affording any clear 
rent whatever. But supposing the value of the wrought lace to be such as that, 
besides paying in the most complete manner the workman and his employer, it 
could afford a clear rent to a third person, it appears to me that, in comparison with 
the labour employed upon land, it would be still as unproductive as ever. Though, 
according to the reasoning used by the French economists, the man employed in the 
manufacture of lace would, in this case, seem to be a productive labourer. Yet 
according to their definition of the wealth of a state, he ought not to be considered 
in that light. He will have added nothing to the gross produce of the land: he has 
consumed a portion of this gross produce, and has left a bit of lace in return; and 
though he may sell this bit of lace for three times the quantity of provisions that he 
consumed whilst he was making it, and thus be a very productive labourer with 
regard to himself, yet he cannot be considered as having added by his labour to any 
essential part of the riches of the state. The clear rent, therefore, that a certain 
produce can afford, after paying the expenses of procuring it, does not appear to be 
the sole criterion, by which to judge of the productiveness or unproductiveness to a 
state of any particular species of labour. 
Suppose that two hundred thousand men, who are now employed in 
producing manufactures that only tend to gratify the vanity of a few rich people, 
were to be employed upon some barren and uncultivated lands, and to produce only 
half the quantity of food that they themselves consumed; they would be still more 
productive labourers with regard to the state than they were before, though their 
labour, so far from affording a rent to a third person, would but half replace the 
provisions used in obtaining the produce. In their former employment they 
consumed a certain portion of the food of the country and left in return some silks 
and laces. In their latter employment they consumed the same quantity of food and 
left in return provision for a hundred thousand men. There can be little doubt 
which of the two legacies would be the most really beneficial to the country, and it 

will, I think, be allowed that the wealth which supported the two hundred thousand 
men while they were producing silks and laces would have been more usefully 
employed in supporting them while they were producing the additional quantity of 
food. . . . 

CHAPTER 18 
The constant pressure of distress on man, from the principle of population, seems to 
direct our hopes to the future - State of trial inconsistent with our ideas of the 
foreknowledge of God - The world, probably, a mighty process for awakening matter 
into mind- Theory of the formation of mind - Excitements from the wants of the 
body - Excitements from the operation ofgeneral laws - Excitements from the 
difficulties of life arising from the principle of population. 

THE view of human life which results from the contemplation of the constant 
pressure of distress on man from the difficulty of subsistence, by showing the little 
expectation that he can reasonably entertain of perfectibility on earth, seems 
strongly to point his hopes to the future. And the temptations to which he must 
necessarily be exposed, from the operation of those laws of nature which we have 
been examining, would seem to represent the world in the light in which it has been 
frequently considered, as a state of trial and school of virtue preparatory to a 
superior state of happiness. But I hope I shall be pardoned if I attempt to give a 
view in some degree different of the situation of man on earth, which appears to me 
to be more consistent with the various phenomena of nature which we observe 
around us and more consonant to our ideas of the power, goodness, and 
foreknowledge of the Deity. 
It cannot be considered as an unimproving exercise of the human mind to 
endeavour to >vindicate the ways of God to man= if we proceed with a proper 
distrust of our own understandings and a just sense of our insufficiency to 
comprehend the reason of all we see, if we hail every ray of light with gratitude, 
and, when no light appears, think that the darkness is from within and not from 
without, and bow with humble deference to the supreme wisdom of him whose 
>thoughts are above our thoughts= >as the heavens are high above the earth.= 
In all our feeble attempts, however, to >find out the Almighty to perfection=, it 
seems absolutely necessary that we should reason from nature up to nature=s God 
and not presume to reason from God to nature. The moment we allow ourselves to 
ask why some things are not otherwise, instead of endeavouring to account for them 
as they are, we shall never know where to stop, we shall be led into the grossest and 
most childish absurdities, all progress in the knowledge of the ways of Providence 
must necessarily be at an end, and the study will even cease to be an improving 
exercise of the human mind. Infinite power is so vast and incomprehensible an idea 
that the mind of man must necessarily be bewildered in the contemplation of it. 
With the crude and puerile conceptions which we sometimes form of this attribute 
of the Deity, we might imagine that God could call into being myriads and myriads 
of existences, all free from pain and imperfection, all eminent in goodness and 
wisdom, all capable of the highest enjoyments, and unnumbered as the points 
throughout infinite space. But when from these vain and extravagant dreams of 
fancy, we turn our eyes to the book of nature, where alone we can read God as he 
is, we see a constant succession of sentient beings, rising apparently from so many 

specks of matter, going through a long and sometimes painful process in this world, 
but many of them attaining, ere the termination of it, such high qualities and 
powers as seem to indicate their fitness for some superior state. Ought we not then 
to correct our crude and puerile ideas of infinite Power from the contemplation of 
what we actually see existing? Can we judge of the Creator but from his creation? 
And, unless we wish to exalt the power of God at the expense of his goodness, ought 
we not to conclude that even to the great Creator, almighty as he is, a certain 
process may be necessary, a certain time (or at least what appears to us as time) 
may be requisite, in order to form beings with those exalted qualities of mind which 
will fit them for his high purposes? 
A state of trial seems to imply a previously formed existence that does not 
agree with the appearance of man in infancy and indicates something like suspicion 
and want of foreknowledge, inconsistent with those ideas which we wish to cherish 
of the Supreme Being. I should be inclined, therefore, as I have hinted before, to 
consider the world and this life as the mighty process of God, not for the trial, but 
for the creation and formation of mind, a process necessary to awaken inert, chaotic 
matter into spirit, to sublimate the dust of the earth into soul, to elicit an ethereal 
spark from the clod of clay. And in this view of the subject, the various impressions 
and excitements which man receives through life may be considered as the forming 
hand of his Creator, acting by general laws, and awakening his sluggish existence, by 
the animating touches of the Divinity, into a capacity of superior enjoyment. The 
original sin of man is the torpor and corruption of the chaotic matter in which he 
may be said to be born. 
It could answer no good purpose to enter into the question whether mind be a 
distinct substance from matter, or only a finer form of it. The question is, perhaps, 
after all, a question merely of words. Mind is as essentially mind, whether formed 
from matter or any other substance. We know from experience that soul and body 
are most intimately united, and every appearance seems to indicate that they grow 
from infancy together. It would be a supposition attended with very little 
probability to believe that a complete and full formed spirit existed in every infant, 
but that it was clogged and impeded in its operations during the first twenty years 
of life by the weakness, or hebetude, of the organs in which it was enclosed. As we 
shall all be disposed to agree that God is the creator of mind as well as of body, and 
as they both seem to be forming and unfolding themselves at the same time, it 
cannot appear inconsistent either with reason or revelation, if it appear to be 
consistent with phenomena of nature, to suppose that God is constantly occupied in 
forming mind out of matter and that the various impressions that man receives 
through life is the process for that purpose. The employment is surely worthy of the 
highest attributes of the Deity. 
This view of the state of man on earth will not seem to be unattended with 
probability, if, judging from the little experience we have of the nature of mind, it 
shall appear upon investigation that the phenomena around us, and the various 
events of human life, seem peculiarly calculated to promote this great end, and 
especially if, upon this supposition, we can account, even to our own narrow 
understandings, for many of those roughnesses and inequalities in life which 
querulous man too frequently makes the subject of his complaint against the God of 
nature. 

The first great awakeners of the mind seem to be the wants of the body. (It 
was my intention to have entered at some length into this subject as a kind of 
second part to the Essay. A long interruption, from particular business, has obliged 
me to lay aside this intention, at least for the present. I shall now, therefore, only 
give a sketch of a few of the leading circumstances that appear to me to favour the 
general supposition that I have advanced.) They are the first stimulants that rouse 
the brain of infant man into sentient activity, and such seems to be the sluggishness 
of original matter that unless by a peculiar course of excitements other wants, 
equally powerful, are generated, these stimulants seem, even afterwards, to be 
necessary to continue that activity which they first awakened. The savage would 
slumber for ever under his tree unless he were roused from his torpor by the 
cravings of hunger or the pinchings of cold, and the exertions that he makes to 
avoid these evils, by procuring food, and building himself a covering, are the 
exercises which form and keep in motion his faculties, which otherwise would sink 
into listless inactivity. From all that experience has taught us concerning the 
structure of the human mind, if those stimulants to exertion which arise from the 
wants of the body were removed from the mass of mankind, we have much more 
reason to think that they would be sunk to the level of brutes, from a deficiency of 
excitements, than that they would be raised to the rank of philosophers by the 
possession of leisure. In those countries where nature is the most redundant in 
spontaneous produce the inhabitants will not be found the most remarkable for 
acuteness of intellect. Necessity has been with great truth called the mother of 
invention. Some of the noblest exertions of the human mind have been set in motion 
by the necessity of satisfying the wants of the body. Want has not unfrequently 
given wings to the imagination of the poet, pointed the flowing periods of the 
historian, and added acuteness to the researches of the philosopher, and though 
there are undoubtedly many minds at present so far improved by the various 
excitements of knowledge, or of social sympathy, that they would not relapse into 
listlessness if their bodily stimulants were removed, yet it can scarcely be doubted 
that these stimulants could not be withdrawn from the mass of mankind without 
producing a general and fatal torpor, destructive of all the germs of future 
improvement. 
Locke, if I recollect, says that the endeavour to avoid pain rather than the 
pursuit of pleasure is the great stimulus to action in life: and that in looking to any 
particular pleasure, we shall not be roused into action in order to obtain it, till the 
contemplation of it has continued so long as to amount to a sensation of pain or 
uneasiness under the absence of it. To avoid evil and to pursue good seem to be the 
great duty and business of man, and this world appears to be peculiarly calculated 
to afford opportunity of the most unremitted exertion of this kind, and it is by this 
exertion, by these stimulants, that mind is formed. If Locke=s idea be just, and there 
is great reason to think that it is, evil seems to be necessary to create exertion, and 
exertion seems evidently necessary to create mind. 
The necessity of food for the support of life gives rise, probably, to a greater 
quantity of exertion than any other want, bodily or mental. The Supreme Being has 
ordained that the earth shall not produce good in great quantities till much 
preparatory labour and ingenuity has been exercised upon its surface. There is no 
conceivable connection to our comprehensions, between the seed and the plant or 
tree that rises from it. The Supreme Creator might, undoubtedly, raise up plants of 

all kinds, for the use of his creatures, without the assistance of those little bits of 
matter, which we call seed, or even without the assisting labour and attention of 
man. The processes of ploughing and clearing the ground, of collecting and sowing 
seeds, are not surely for the assistance of God in his creation, but are made 
previously necessary to the enjoyment of the blessings of life, in order to rouse man 
into action, and form his mind to reason. 
To furnish the most unremitted excitements of this kind, and to urge man to 
further the gracious designs of Providence by the full cultivation of the earth, it has 
been ordained that population should increase much faster than food. This general 
law (as it has appeared in the former parts of this Essay) undoubtedly produces 
much partial evil, but a little reflection may, perhaps, satisfy us, that it produces a 
great overbalance of good. Strong excitements seem necessary to create exertion, 
and to direct this exertion, and form the reasoning faculty, it seems absolutely 
necessary, that the Supreme Being should act always according to general laws. The 
constancy of the laws of nature, or the certainty with which we may expect the 
same effects from the same causes, is the foundation of the faculty of reason. If in 
the ordinary course of things, the finger of God were frequently visible, or to speak 
more correctly, if God were frequently to change his purpose (for the finger of God 
is, indeed, visible in every blade of grass that we see), a general and fatal torpor of 
the human faculties would probably ensue; even the bodily wants of mankind would 
cease to stimulate them to exertion, could they not reasonably expect that if their 
efforts were well directed they would be crowned with success. The constancy of the 
laws of nature is the foundation of the industry and foresight of the husbandman, 
the indefatigable ingenuity of the artificer, the skilful researches of the physician and 
anatomist, and the watchful observation and patient investigation of the natural 
philosopher. To this constancy we owe all the greatest and noblest efforts of 
intellect. To this constancy we owe the immortal mind of a Newton. 
As the reasons, therefore, for the constancy of the laws of nature seem, even 
to our understandings, obvious and striking; if we return to the principle of 
population and consider man as he really is, inert, sluggish, and averse from labour, 
unless compelled by necessity (and it is surely the height of folly to talk of man, 
according to our crude fancies of what he might be), we may pronounce with 
certainty that the world would not have been peopled, but for the superiority of the 
power of population to the means of subsistence. Strong and constantly operative as 
this stimulus is on man to urge him to the cultivation of the earth, if we still see 
that cultivation proceeds very slowly, we may fairly conclude that a less stimulus 
would have been insufficient. Even under the operation of this constant excitement, 
savages will inhabit countries of the greatest natural fertility for a long period before 
they betake themselves to pasturage or agriculture. Had population and food 
increased in the same ratio, it is probable that man might never have emerged from 
the savage state. But supposing the earth once well peopled, an Alexander, a Julius 
Caesar, a Tamberlane, or a bloody revolution might irrecoverably thin the human 
race, and defeat the great designs of the Creator. The ravages of a contagious 
disorder would be felt for ages; and an earthquake might unpeople a region for ever. 
The principle, according to which population increases, prevents the vices of 
mankind, or the accidents of nature, the partial evils arising from general laws, from 
obstructing the high purpose of the creation. It keeps the inhabitants of the earth 
always fully up to the level of the means of subsistence; and is constantly acting 

upon man as a powerful stumulus, urging him to the further cultivation of the earth, 
and to enable it, consequently, to support a more extended population. But it is 
impossible that this law can operate, and produce the effects apparently intended by 
the Supreme Being, without occasioning partial evil. Unless the principle of 
population were to be altered according to the circumstances of each separate 
country (which would not only be contrary to our universal experience, with regard 
to the laws of nature, but would contradict even our own reason, which sees the 
absolute necessity of general laws for the formation of intellect), it is evident that 
the same principle which, seconded by industry, will people a fertile region in a few 
years must produce distress in countries that have been long inhabited. 
It seems, however, every way probable that even the acknowledged difficulties 
occasioned by the law of population tend rather to promote than impede the general 
purpose of Providence. They excite universal exertion and contribute to that infinite 
variety of situations, and consequently of impressions, which seems upon the whole 
favourable to the growth of mind. It is probable, that too great or too little 
excitement, extreme poverty, or too great riches may be alike unfavourable in this 
respect. The middle regions of society seem to be best suited to intellectual 
improvement, but it is contrary to the analogy of all nature to expect that the 
whole of society can be a middle region. The temperate zones of the earth seem to 
be the most favourable to the mental and corporal energies of man, but all cannot 
be temperate zones. A world, warmed and enlightened but by one sun, must from 
the laws of matter have some parts chilled by perpetual frosts and others scorched 
by perpetual heats. Every piece of matter lying on a surface must have an upper 
and an under side, all the particles cannot be in the middle. The most valuable parts 
of an oak, to a timber merchant, are not either the roots or the branches, but these 
are absolutely necessary to the existence of the middle part, or stem, which is the 
object in request. The timber merchant could not possibly expect to make an oak 
grow without roots or branches, but if he could find out a mode of cultivation which 
would cause more of the substance to go to stem, and less to root and branch, he 
would be right to exert himself in bringing such a system into general use. 
In the same manner, though we cannot possibly expect to exclude riches and 
poverty from society, yet if we could find out a mode of government by which the 
numbers in the extreme regions would be lessened and the numbers in the middle 
regions increased, it would be undoubtedly our duty to adopt it. It is not, however, 
improbable that as in the oak, the roots and branches could not be diminished very 
greatly without weakening the vigorous circulation of the sap in the stem, so in 
society the extreme parts could not be diminished beyond a certain degree without 
lessening that animated exertion throughout the middle parts, which is the very 
cause that they are the most favourable to the growth of intellect. If no man could 
hope to rise or fear to fall, in society, if industry did not bring with it its reward and 
idleness its punishment, the middle parts would not certainly be what they now are. 
In reasoning upon this subject, it is evident that we ought to consider chiefly the 
mass of mankind and not individual instances. There are undoubtedly many minds, 
and there ought to be many, according to the chances out of so great a mass, that, 
having been vivified early by a peculiar course of excitements, would not need the 
constant action of narrow motives to continue them in activity. But if we were to 
review the various useful discoveries, the valuable writings, and other laudable 
exertions of mankind, I believe we should find that more were to be attributed to 

the narrow motives that operate upon the many than to the apparently more 
enlarged motives that operate upon the few. 
Leisure is, without doubt, highly valuable to man, but taking man as he is, 
the probability seems to be that in the greater number of instances it will produce 
evil rather than good. It has been not infrequently remarked that talents are more 
common among younger brothers than among elder brothers, but it can scarcely be 
imagined that younger brothers are, upon an average, born with a greater original 
susceptibility of parts. The difference, if there really is any observable difference, 
can only arise from their different situations. Exertion and activity are in general 
absolutely necessary in one case and are only optional in the other. 
That the difficulties of life contribute to generate talents, every day=s 
experience must convince us. The exertions that men find it necessary to make, in 
order to support themselves or families, frequently awaken faculties that might 
otherwise have lain for ever dormant, and it has been commonly remarked that new 
and extraordinary situations generally create minds adequate to grapple with the 
difficulties in which they are involved. 

CHAPTER 19 
The sorrows of life necessary to soften and humanize the heart - The excitement of 
social sympathy often produce characters of a higher order than the mere possessors 
of talents - Moral evil probably necessary to the production of moral excellence (cid:173)
Excitements from intellectual wants continually kept up by the infinite variety of 
nature, and the obscurity that involves metaphysical subjects - The difficulties in 
revelation to be accounted for upon this principle - The degree of evidence which 
the scriptures contain, probably, best suited to the improvements of the human 
faculties,and the moral amerlioration of mankind - The idea that mind is created by 
excitements seems to account for the existence of natural and moral evil. 

THE sorrows and distresses of life form another class of excitements, which 
seem to be necessary, by a peculiar train of impressions, to soften and humanize the 
heart, to awaken social sympathy, to generate all the Christian virtues, and to 
afford scope for the ample exertion of benevolence. The general tendency of an 
uniform course of prosperity is rather to degrade than exalt the character. The 
heart that has never known sorrow itself will seldom be feelingly alive to the pains 
and pleasures, the wants and wishes, of its fellow beings. It will seldom be 
overflowing with that warmth of brotherly love, those kind and amiable affections, 
which dignify the human character even more than the possession of the highest 
talents. Talents, indeed, though undoubtedly a very prominent and fine feature of 
mind, can by no means be considered as constituting the whole of it. There are 
many minds which have not been exposed to those excitements that usually form 
talents, that have yet been vivified to a high degree by the excitements of social 
sympathy. In every rank of life, in the lowest as frequently as in the highest, 
characters are to be found overflowing with the milk of human kindness, breathing 
love towards God and man, and, though without those peculiar powers of mind 
called talents, evidently holding a higher rank in the scale of beings than many who 
possess them. Evangelical charity, meekness, piety, and all that class of virtues 
distinguished particularly by the name of Christian virtues do not seem necessarily 
to include abilities; yet a soul possessed of these amiable qualities, a soul awakened 

and vivified by these delightful sympathies, seems to hold a nearer commerce with 
the skies than mere acuteness of intellect. 
The greatest talents have been frequently misapplied and have produced evil 
proportionate to the extent of their powers. Both reason and revelation seem to 
assure us that such minds will be condemned to eternal death, but while on earth, 
these vicious instruments performed their part in the great mass of impressions, by 
the disgust and abhorrence which they excited. It seems highly probable that moral 
evil is absolutely necessary to the production of moral excellence. A being with only 
good placed in view may be justly said to be impelled by a blind necessity. The 
pursuit of good in this case can be no indication of virtuous propensities. It might be 
said, perhaps, that infinite Wisdom cannot want such an indication as outward 
action, but would foreknow with certainly whether the being would choose good or 
evil. This might be a plausible argument against a state of trial, but will not hold 
against the supposition that mind in this world is in a state of formation. Upon this 
idea, the being that has seen moral evil and has felt disapprobation and disgust at it 
is essentially different from the being that has seen only good. They are pieces of 
clay that have received distinct impressions: they must, therefore, necessarily be in 
different shapes; or, even if we allow them both to have the same lovely form of 
virtue, it must be acknowledged that one has undergone the further process, 
necessary to give firmness and durability to its substance, while the other is still 
exposed to injury, and liable to be broken by every accidental impulse. An ardent 
love and admiration of virtue seems to imply the existence of something opposite to 
it, and it seems highly probable that the same beauty of form and substance, the 
same perfection of character, could not be generated without the impressions of 
disapprobation which arise from the spectacle of moral evil. 
When the mind has been awakened into activity by the passions, and the 
wants of the body, intellectual wants arise; and the desire of knowledge, and the 
impatience under ignorance, form a new and important class of excitements. Every 
part of nature seems peculiarly calculated to furnish stimulants to mental exertion 
of this kind, and to offer inexhaustible food for the most unremitted inquiry. Our 
mortal Bard says of Cleopatra: 

  Custom cannot stale 

   Her infinite variety. 

The expression, when applied to any one object, may be considered as a poetical 
amplification, but it is accurately true when applied to nature. Infinite variety 
seems, indeed, eminently her characteristic feature. The shades that are here and 
there blended in the picture give spirit, life, and prominence to her exuberant 
beauties, and those roughnesses and inequalities, those inferior parts that support 
the superior, though they sometimes offend the fastidious microscopic eye of 
short-sighted man, contribute to the symmetry, grace, and fair proportion of the 
whole. 
The infinite variety of the forms and operations of nature, besides tending 
immediately to awaken and improve the mind by the variety of impressions that it 

creates, opens other fertile sources of improvement by offering so wide and extensive 
a field for investigation and research. Uniform, undiversified perfection could not 
possess the same awakening powers. When we endeavour then to contemplate the 
system of the universe, when we think of the stars as the suns of other systems 
scattered throughout infinite space, when we reflect that we do not probably see a 
millionth part of those bright orbs that are beaming light and life to unnumbered 
worlds, when our minds, unable to grasp the immeasurable conception, sink, lost 
and confounded, in admiration at the mighty incomprehensible power of the 
Creator, let us not querulously complain that all climates are not equally genial, 
that perpetual spring does not reign throughout the year, that it God=s creatures do 
not possess the same advantages, that clouds and tempests sometimes darken the 
natural world and vice and misery the moral world, and that all the works of the 
creation are not formed with equal perfection. Both reason and experience seem to 
indicate to us that the infinite variety of nature (and variety cannot exist without 
inferior parts, or apparent blemishes) is admirably adapted to further the high 
purpose of the creation and to produce the greatest possible quantity of good. 
The obscurity that involves all metaphysical subjects appears to me, in the 
same manner, peculiarly calculated to add to that class of excitements which arise 
from the thirst of knowledge. It is probable that man, while on earth, will never be 
able to attain complete satisfaction on these subjects; but this is by no means a 
reason that he should not engage in them. The darkness that surrounds these 
interesting topics of human curiosity may be intended to furnish endless motives to 
intellectual activity and exertion. The constant effort to dispel this darkness, even if 
it fail of success, invigorates and improves the thinking faculty. If the subjects of 
human inquiry were once exhausted, mind would probably stagnate; but the 
infinitely diversified forms and operations of nature, together with the endless food 
for speculation which metaphysical subjects offer, prevent the possibility that such a 
period should ever arrive. 
It is by no means one of the wisest sayings of Solomon that >there is no new 
thing under the sun.=  On the contrary, it is probable that were the present system 
to continue for millions of years, continual additions would be making to the mass of 
human knowledge, and yet, perhaps, it may be a matter of doubt whether what may 
be called the capacity of mind be in any marked and decided manner increasing. A 
Socrates, a Plato, or an Aristotle, however confessedly inferior in knowledge to the 
philosophers of the present day, do not appear to have been much below them in 
intellectual capacity. Intellect rises from a speck, continues in vigour only for a 
certain period, and will not perhaps admit while on earth of above a certain number 
of impressions. These impressions may, indeed, be infinitely modified, and from 
these various modifications, added probably to a difference in the susceptibility of 
the original germs, arise the endless diversity of character that we see in the world; 
but reason and experience seem both to assure us that the capacity of individual 
minds does not increase in proportion to the mass of existing knowledge. (It is 
probable that no two grains of wheat are exactly alike. Soil undoubtedly makes the 
principal difference in the blades that spring up, but probably not all. It seems 
natural to suppose some sort of difference in the original germs that are afterwards 
awakened into thought, and the extraordinary difference of susceptibility in very 
young children seems to confirm the supposition.) 

The finest minds seem to be formed rather by efforts at original thinking, by 
endeavours to form new combinations, and to discover new truths, than by passively 
receiving the impressions of other men=s ideas. Could we suppose the period arrived, 
when there was not further hope of future discoveries, and the only employment of 
mind was to acquire pre-existing knowledge, without any efforts to form new and 
original combinations, though the mass of human knowledge were a thousand times 
greater than it is at present, yet it is evident that one of the noblest stimulants to 
mental exertion would have ceased; the finest feature of intellect would be lost; 
everything allied to genius would be at an end; and it appears to be impossible, 
that, under such circumstances, any individuals could possess the same intellectual 
energies as were possessed by a Locke, a Newton, or a Shakespeare, or even by a 
Socrates, a Plato, an Aristotle or a Homer. 
If a revelation from heaven of which no person could feel the smallest doubt 
were to dispel the mists that now hang over metaphysical subjects, were to explain 
the nature and structure of mind, the affections and essences of all substances, the 
mode in which the Supreme Being operates in the works of the creation, and the 
whole plan and scheme of the Universe, such an accession of knowledge so obtained, 
instead of giving additional vigour and activity to the human mind, would in all 
probability tend to repress future exertion and to damp the soaring wings of 
intellect. 

For this reason I have never considered the doubts and difficulties 
that involve some parts of the sacred writings as any ardent against their 
divine original. The Supreme Being might, undoubtedly, have accompanied 
his revelations to man by such a succession of miracles, and of such a nature, 
as would have produced universal overpowering conviction and have put an 
end at once to all hesitation and discussion. But weak as our reason is to 
comprehend the plans of the great Creator, it is yet sufficiently strong to see 
the most striking objections to such a revelation. From the little we know of 
the structure of the human understanding, we must be convinced that an 
overpowering conviction of this kind, instead of tending to the improvement 
and moral amelioration of man, would act like the touch of a torpedo on all 
intellectual exertion and would almost put an end to the existence of virtue. 
If the scriptural denunciations of eternal punishment were brought home 
with the same certainty to every man=s mind as that the night will follow the 
day, this one vast and gloomy idea would take such full possession of the 
human faculties as to leave no room for any other conceptions, the external 
actions of men would be all nearly alike, virtuous conduct would be no 
indication of virtuous disposition, vice and virtue would be blended together 
in one common mass, and though the all-seeing eye of God might distinguish 
them they must necessarily make the same impressions on man, who can 
judge only from external appearances. Under such a dispensation, it is 
difficult to conceive how human beings could be formed to a detestation of 
moral evil, and a love and admiration of God, and of moral excellence. 
Our ideas of virtue and vice are not, perhaps, very accurate and 
well-defined; but few, I think, would call an action really virtuous which was 
performed simply and solely from the dread of a very great punishment or 
the expectation of a very great reward. The fear of the Lord is very justly 
said to be the beginning of wisdom, but the end of wisdom is the love of the 
Lord and the admiration of moral good. The denunciations of future 
punishment contained in the scriptures seem to be well calculated to arrest 
the progress of the vicious and awaken the attention of the careless, but we 
see from repeated experience that they are not accompanied with evidence of 
such a nature as to overpower the human will and to make men lead 
virtuous lives with vicious dispositions, merely from a dread of hereafter. A 
genuine faith, by which I mean a faith that shows itself in it the virtues of a 
truly Christian life, may generally be considered as an indication of an 
amiable and virtuous disposition, operated upon more by love than by pure 
unmixed fear. 
When we reflect on the temptations to which man must necessarily be 
exposed in this world, from the structure of his frame, and the operation of 
the laws of nature, and the consequent moral certainty that many vessels 
will come out of this mighty creative furnace in wrong shapes, it is perfectly 
impossible to conceive that any of these creatures of God=s hand can be 
condemned to eternal suffering. Could we once admit such an idea, it our 
natural conceptions of goodness and justice would be completely overthrown, 
and we could no longer look up to God as a merciful and righteous Being. 
But the doctrine of life and Mortality which was brought to light by the 
gospel, the doctrine that the end of righteousness is everlasting life, but that 

the wages of sin are death, is in every respect just and merciful, and worthy 
of the great Creator. Nothing can appear more consonant to our reason than 
that those beings which come out of the creative process of the world in 
lovely and beautiful forms should be crowned with immortality, while those 
which come out misshapen, those whose minds are not suited to a purer and 
happier state of existence, should perish and be condemned to mix again 
with their original clay. Eternal condemnation of this kind may be 
considered as a species of eternal punishment, and it is not wonderful that it 
should be represented, sometimes, under images of suffering. But life and 
death, salvation and destruction, are more frequently opposed to each other 
in the New Testament than happiness and misery. The Supreme Being 
would appear to us in a very different view if we were to consider him as 
pursuing the creatures that had offended him with eternal hate and torture, 
instead of merely condemning to their original insensibility those beings that, 
by the operation of general laws, had not been formed with qualities suited 
to a purer state of happiness. 

Life is, generally speaking, a blessing independent of a future state. It 
is a gift which the vicious would not always be ready to throw away, even if 
they had no fear of death. The partial pain, therefore, that is inflicted by the 
supreme Creator, while he is forming numberless beings to a capacity of the 
highest enjoyments, is but as the dust of the balance in comparison of the 
happiness that is communicated, and we have every reason to think that 
there is no more evil in the world than what is absolutely necessary as one of 
the ingredients in the mighty process. 
The striking necessity of general laws for the formation of intellect will 
not in any respect be contradicted by one or two exceptions, and these 
evidently not intended for partial purposes, but calculated to operate upon a 
great part of mankind, and through many ages. Upon the idea that I have 
given of the formation of mind, the infringement of the general law of 
nature, by a divine revelation, will appear in the light of the immediate hand 
of God mixing new ingredients in the mighty mass, suited to the particular 
state of the process, and calculated to give rise to a new and powerful train 
of impressions, tending to purify, exalt, and improve the human mind. The 
miracles that accompanied these revelations when they had once excited the 
attention of mankind, and rendered it a matter of most interesting 
discussion, whether the doctrine was from God or man, had performed their 
part, had answered the purpose of the Creator. and these communications of 
the divine will were afterwards left to make their way by their own intrinsic 
excellence; and, by operating as moral motives, gradually to influence and 
improve, and not to overpower and stagnate the faculties of man. 
It would be, undoubtedly, presumptuous to say that the Supreme 
Being could not possibly have effected his purpose in any other way than 
that which he has chosen, but as the revelation of the divine will which we 
possess is attended with some doubts and difficulties, and as our reason 
points out to us the strongest objections to a revelation which would force 
immediate, implicit, universal belief, we have surely just cause to think that 
these doubts and difficulties are no argument against the divine origin of the 

scriptures, and that the species of evidence which they possess is best suited 
to the improvement of the human faculties and the moral amelioration of 
mankind. 
The idea that the impressions and excitements of this world are the 
instruments with which the Supreme Being forms matter into mind, and 
that the necessity of constant exertion to avoid evil and to pursue good is 
the principal spring of these impressions and excitements, seems to smooth 
many of the difficulties that occur in a contemplation of human life, and 
appears to me to give a satisfactory reason for the existence of natural and 
moral evil, and, consequently, for that part of both, and it certainly is not a 
very small part, which arises from the principle of population. But, though, 
upon this supposition, it seems highly improbable that evil should ever be 
removed from the world, yet it is evident that this impression would not 
answer the apparent purpose of the Creator, it would not act so powerfully 
as an excitement to exertion, if the quantity of it did not diminish or 
increase with the activity or the indolence of man. The continual variations 
in the weight and in the distribution of this pressure keep alive a constant 
expectation of throwing it off. 

   Hope springs eternal in the Human breast,  

   Man never is, but always to be blest.


    Evil exists in the world not to create despair but activity. We are not 
patiently to submit to it, but to exert ourselves to avoid it. It is not only the 
interest but the duty of every individual to use his utmost efforts to remove 
evil from himself and from as large a circle as he can influence, and the more 
he exercises himself in this duty, the more wisely he directs his efforts, and 
the more successful these efforts are, the more he will probably improve and 
exalt his own mind and the more completely does he appear to fulfil the will 
of his Creator.
