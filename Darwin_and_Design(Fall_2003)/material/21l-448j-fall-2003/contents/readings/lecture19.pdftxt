PROLEGOMENA [1894] 

 

I 

IT MAY be safely assumed that, two thousand years ago, before Cæsar set foot in 
southern Britain, the whole country-side visible from the windows of the room in 
which I write, was in what is called "the state of nature". Except, it may be, by 
raising a few sepulchral mounds, such as those which still, here and there, break the 
flowing contours of the downs, man's hands had made no mark upon it; and the thin 
veil of vegetation which overspread the broad-backed heights and the shelving sides 
of the coombs was unaffected by his industry. The native grasses and weeds, the 
scattered patches of gorse, contended with one another for the possession of the 
scanty surface soil; they fought against the droughts of summer, the frosts of winter, 
and the furious gales which swept, with unbroken force, now from the Atlantic, and 
now from the North Sea, at all times of the year; they filled up, as they best might, 
the gaps made in their ranks by all sorts of underground and overground animal 
ravagers. One year with another, an average population, the floating balance of the 
unceasing struggle for existence among the indigenous plants, maintained itself. It is 
as little to be doubted, that an essentially similar state of nature prevailed, in this 
region, for many thousand years before the coming of Cæsar; and there is no 
assignable reason for denying that it might continue to exist through an equally 
prolonged futurity, except for the intervention of man. 

Reckoned by our customary standards of duration, the native vegetation, like the 
"everlasting hills" which it clothes, seems a type of permanence. The little Amarella 
Gentians, which abound in some places to-day, are the descendants of those that 
were trodden underfoot by the prehistoric savages who have left their flint tools 
about, here and there; and they followed ancestors which, in the climate of the 
glacial epoch, probably flourished better than they do now. Compared with the long 
past of this humble plant, all the history of civilized men is but an episode. 

Yet nothing is more certain than that, measured by the liberal scale of time-keeping 
of the universe, this present state of nature, however it may seem to have gone and 
to go on for ever, is but a fleeting phase of her infinite variety; merely the last of 
the series of changes which the earth's surface has undergone in the course of the 
millions of years of its existence. Turn back a square foot of the thin turf, and the 
solid foundation of the land, exposed in cliffs of chalk five hundred feet high on the 
adjacent shore, yields full assurance of a time when the sea covered the site of the 
"everlasting hills"; and when the vegetation of what land lay nearest, was as 
different from the present Flora of the Sussex Downs, as that of Central Africa now 
is. No less certain is it that, between the time during which the chalk was formed 

and that at which the original turf came into existence, thousands of centuries 
elapsed, in the course of which, the state of nature of the ages during which the 
chalk was deposited, passed into that which now is, by changes so slow that, in the 
coming and going of the generations of men, had such witnessed them, the 
contemporary conditions would have seemed to be unchanging and unchangeable. 

But it is also certain that, before the deposition of the chalk, a vastly longer period 
had elapsed, throughout which it is easy to follow the traces of the same process of 
ceaseless modification and of the internecine struggle for existence of living things; 
and that even when we can get no further back, it is not because there is any reason 
to think we have reached the beginning, but because the trail of the most ancient 
life remains hidden, or has become obliterated. 

Thus that state of nature of the world of plants, which we began by considering, is 
far from possessing the attribute of permanence. Rather its very essence is 
impermanence. It may have lasted twenty or thirty thousand years, it may last for 
twenty or thirty thousand years more, without obvious change; but, as surely as it 
has followed upon a very different state, so it will be followed by an equally different 
condition. That which endures is not one or another association of living forms, but 
the process of which the cosmos is the product, and of which these are among the 
transitory expressions. And in the living world, one of the most characteristic 
features of this cosmic process is the struggle for existence, the competition of each 
with all, the result of which is the selection, that is to say, the survival of those 
forms which, on the whole, are best adapted to the conditions which at any period 
obtain; and which are, therefore, in that respect, and only in that respect, the 
fittest1. The acme reached by the cosmic process in the vegetation of the downs is 
seen in the turf, with its weeds and gorse. Under the conditions, they have come out 
of the struggle victorious; and, by surviving, have proved that they are the fittest to 
survive.  

That the state of nature, at any time, is a temporary phase of a process of incessant 
change, which has been going on for innumerable ages, appears to me to be a 
proposition as well established as any in modern history. Paleontology assures us, in 
addition, that the ancient philosophers who, with less reason, held the same 
doctrine, erred in supposing that the phases formed a cycle, exactly repeating the 
past, exactly foreshadowing the future, in their rotations. On the contrary, it 
furnishes us with conclusive reasons for thinking that, if every link in the ancestry of 
these humble indigenous plants had been preserved and were accessible to us, the 
whole would present a converging series of forms of gradually diminishing 
complexity, until, at some period in the history of the earth, far more remote than 
any of which organic remains have yet been discovered, they would merge in those 
low groups among which the boundaries between animal and vegetable life become 
effaced. 

1 That every theory of evolution must be consistent not merely with progressive 
development, but with indefinite persistence in the same condition and with retrogressive 
modification, is a point which I have insisted upon repeatedly from the year 1862 till now. 

The word "evolution", now generally applied to the cosmic process, has had a 
singular history, and is used in various senses. Taken in its popular signification it 
means progressive development, that is, gradual change from a condition of relative 
uniformity to one of relative complexity; but its connotation has been widened to 
include the phenomena of retrogressive metamorphosis, that is, of progress from a 
condition of relative complexity to one of relative uniformity.  

As a natural process, of the same character as the development of a tree from its 
seed, or of a fowl from its egg, evolution excludes creation and all other kinds of 
supernatural intervention. As the expression of a fixed order, every stage of which is 
the effect of causes operating according to definite rules, the conception of evolution 
no less excludes that of chance. It is very desirable to remember that evolution is 
not an explanation of the cosmic process, but merely a generalized statement of the 
method and results of that process. And, further, that, if there is proof that the 
cosmic process was set going by any agent, then that agent will be the creator of it 
and of all its products, although supernatural intervention may remain strictly 
excluded from its further course.  

So far as that limited revelation of the nature of things, which we call scientific 
knowledge, has yet gone, it tends, with constantly increasing emphasis, to the belief 
that, not merely the world of plants, but that of animals; not merely living things, 
but the whole fabric of the earth; not merely our planet, but the whole solar system; 
not merely our star and its satellites, but the millions of similar bodies which bear 
witness to the order which pervades boundless space, and has endured through 
boundless times; are all working out their predestined courses of evolution.  

With none of these have I anything to do, at present, except with that exhibited by 
the forms of life which tenant the earth. All plants and animals exhibit the tendency 
to vary, the causes of which have yet to be ascertained; it is the tendency of the 
conditions of life, at any given time, while favouring the existence of the variations 
best adapted to them, to oppose that of the rest and thus to exercise selection; and 
all living things tend to multiply without limit, while the means of support are 
limited; the obvious cause of which is the production of offspring more numerous 
than their progenitors, but with equal expectation of life in the actuarial sense. 
Without the first tendency there could be no evolution. Without the second, there 
would be no good reason why one variation should disappear and another take its 
place; that is to say, there would be no selection. Without the third, the struggle for 
existence, the agent of the selective process in the state of nature, would vanish.  

Granting the existence of these tendencies, all the known facts of the history of 
plants and of animals may be brought into rational correlation. And this is more 
than can be said for any other hypothesis that I know of. Such hypotheses, for 
example, as that of the existence of a primitive, orderless chaos; of a passive and 
sluggish eternal matter moulded, with but partial success, by archetypal ideas; of a 
brand-new world- stuff suddenly created and swiftly shaped by a supernatural 
power; receive no encouragement, but the contrary, from our present knowledge. 
That our earth may once have formed part of a nebulous cosmic magma is certainly 

possible, indeed seems highly probable; but there is no reason to doubt that order 
reigned there, as completely as amidst what we regard as the most finished works of 
nature or of man. The faith which is born of knowledge, finds its object in an eternal 
order, bringing forth ceaseless change, through endless time, in endless space; the 
manifestations of the cosmic energy alternating between phases of potentiality and 
phases of explication. It may be that, as Kant suggests, every cosmic magma 
predestined to evolve into a new world, has been the no less predestined end of a 
vanished predecessor. 

II 

Three or four years have elapsed since the state of nature, to which I have referred, 
was brought to an end, so far as a small patch of the soil is concerned, by the 
intervention of man. The patch was cut off from the rest by a wall; within the area 
thus protected, the native vegetation was, as far as possible, extirpated; while a 
colony of strange plants was imported and set down in its place. In short, it was 
made into a garden. At the present time, this artificially treated area presents an 
aspect extraordinarily different from that of so much of the land as remains in the 
state of nature, outside the wall. Trees, shrubs, and herbs, many of them 
appertaining to the state of nature of remote parts of the globe, abound and 
flourish. Moreover, considerable quantities of vegetables, fruits, and flowers are 
produced, of kinds which neither now exist, nor have ever existed, except under 
conditions such as obtain in the garden; and which, therefore, are as much works of 
the art of man as the frames and glass-houses in which some of them are raised. 
That the "state of Art", thus created in the state of nature by man, is sustained by 
and dependent on him, would at once become apparent, if the watchful supervision 
of the gardener were withdrawn, and the antagonistic influences of the general 
cosmic process were no longer sedulously warded off, or counteracted. The walls and 
gates would decay; quadrupedal and bipedal intruders would devour and tread down 
the useful and beautiful plants; birds, insects, blight, and mildew would work their 
will; the seeds of the native plants, carried by winds or other agencies, would 
immigrate, and in virtue of their long- earned special adaptation to the local 
conditions, these despised native weeds would soon choke their choice exotic rivals. 
A century or two hence, little beyond the foundations of the wall and of the houses 
and frames would be left, in evidence of the victory of the cosmic powers at work in 
the state of nature, over the temporary obstacles to their supremacy, set up by the 
art of the horticulturist.  

It will be admitted that the garden is as much a work of art2, or artifice, as anything 
that can be mentioned. The energy localized in certain human bodies, directed by 
similarly localized intellects, has produced a collocation of other material bodies 
which could not be brought about in the state of nature. The same proposition is 
true of all the works of man's hands, from a flint implement to a cathedral or a 

2  Editor=s note:  Huxley adds a footnote here to indicate that he does not mean by Aart@ 
what we mean by it, namely, the so-called Afine arts@ but rather what Aristotle and Plato meant 
by teche, a part of human technology, however crude. 

chronometer; and it is because it is true, that we call these things artificial, term 
them works of art, or artifice, by way of distinguishing them from the products of 
the cosmic process, working outside man, which we call natural, or works of nature. 
The distinction thus drawn between the works of nature and those of man, is 
universally recognized; and it is, as I conceive, both useful and justifiable. 

III 

No doubt, it may be properly urged that the operation of human energy and 
intelligence, which has brought into existence and maintains the garden, by what I 
have called "the horticultural process", is, strictly speaking, part and parcel of the 
cosmic process. And no one could more readily agree to that proposition than I. In 
fact, I do not know that any one has taken more pains than I have, during the last 
thirty years, to insist upon the doctrine, so much reviled in the early part of that 
period, that man, physical, intellectual, and moral, is as much a part of nature, as 
purely a product of the cosmic process, as the humblest weed. 

But if, following up this admission, it is urged that, such being the case, the cosmic 
process cannot be in antagonism with that horticultural process which is part of 
itself--I can only reply, that if the conclusion that the two are antagonistic is 
logically absurd, I am sorry for logic, because, as we have seen, the fact is so. The 
garden is in the same position as every other work of man's art; it is a result of the 
cosmic process working through and by human energy and intelligence; and, as is 
the case with every other artificial thing set up in the state of nature, the influences 
of the latter are constantly tending to break it down and destroy it. No doubt, the 
Forth bridge and an ironclad in the offing, are, in ultimate resort, products of the 
cosmic process; as much so as the river which flows under the one, or the sea-water 
on which the other floats. Nevertheless, every breeze strains the bridge a little, 
every tide does something to weaken its foundations; every change of temperature 
alters the adjustment of its parts, produces friction and consequent wear and tear. 
From time to time, the bridge must be repaired, just as the ironclad must go into 
dock; simply because nature is always tending to reclaim that which her child, man, 
has borrowed from her and has arranged in combinations which are not those 
favoured by the general cosmic process. 

Thus, it is not only true that the cosmic energy, working through man upon a 
portion of the plant world, opposes the same energy as it works through the state of 
nature, but a similar antagonism is everywhere manifest between the artificial and 
the natural. Even in the state of nature itself, what is the struggle for existence but 
the antagonism of the results of the cosmic process in the region of life, one to 
another?3 

3 Or, to put the case still more simply:  When a man lays hold of the two ends of a piece 
of string and pulls them, with intent to break it, the right arm is certainly exerted in antagonism 
to the left arm;  yet both arms derive their energy from the same original source.  [Editor=s note. 
In the main body of the essay, to which this is prolegomena, Huxley had touched upon the issue 
raised here in another footnote, number 20, where he wrote:  AOf course, strictly speaking, social 
life, and the ethical process in virtue of which it advances towards perfection, are part and parcel 

IV 

Not only is the state of nature hostile to the state of art of the garden; but the 
principle of the horticultural process, by which the latter is created and maintained, 
is antithetic to that of the cosmic process. The characteristic feature of the latter is 
the intense and unceasing competition of the struggle for existence. The 
characteristic of the former is the elimination of that struggle, by the removal of the 
conditions which give rise to it. The tendency of the cosmic process is to bring about 
the adjustment of the forms of plant life to the current conditions; the tendency of 
the horticultural process is the adjustment of the conditions to the needs of the 
forms of plant life which the gardener desires to raise. 

The cosmic process uses unrestricted multiplication as the means whereby hundreds 
compete for the place and nourishment adequate for one; it employs frost and 
drought to cut off the weak and unfortunate; to survive, there is need not only of 
strength, but of flexibility and of good fortune. 

The gardener, on the other hand, restricts multiplication; provides that each plant 
shall have sufficient space and nourishment; protects from frost and drought; and, in 
every other way, attempts to modify the conditions, in such a manner as to bring 
about the survival of those forms which most nearly approach the standard of the 
useful, or the beautiful, which he has in his mind.  

If the fruits and the tubers, the foliage and the flowers thus obtained, reach, or 
sufficiently approach, that ideal, there is no reason why the status quo attained 
should not be indefinitely prolonged. So long as the state of nature remains 
approximately the same, so long will the energy and intelligence which created the 
garden suffice to maintain it. However, the limits within which this mastery of man 
over nature can be maintained are narrow. If the conditions of the cretaceous epoch 
returned, I fear the most skilful of gardeners would have to give up the cultivation 
of apples and gooseberries; while, if those of the glacial period once again obtained, 
open asparagus beds would be superfluous, and the training of fruit trees against the 
most favourable of south walls, a waste of time and trouble.  

of the general process of evolution, just as the gregarious habit of innumerable plants and 
animals, which has been of immense advantage to them, is so. A hive of bees is an organic 
polity, a society in which the part played by each member is determined by organic necessities. 
Queens, workers, and drones are, so to speak, castes, divided from one another by marked 
physical barriers. Among birds and mammals, societies are formed, of which the bond in many 
cases seems to be purely psychological; that is to say, it appears to depend upon the liking of the 
individuals for one another's company. The tendency of individuals to over self-assertion is kept 
down by fighting. Even in these rudimentary forms of society, love and fear come into play, and 
enforce a greater or less renunciation of self-will. To this extent the general cosmic process 
begins to be checked by a rudimentary ethical process, which is, strictly speaking, part of the 
former, just as the 'governor' in a steam-engine is part of the mechanism of the engine.@ 

But it is extremely important to note that, the state of nature remaining the same, 
if the produce does not satisfy the gardener, it may be made to approach his ideal 
more closely. Although the struggle for existence may be at end, the possibility of 
progress remains. In discussions on these topics, it is often strangely forgotten that 
the essential conditions of the modification, or evolution, of living things are 
variation and hereditary transmission. Selection is the means by which certain 
variations are favoured and their progeny preserved. But the struggle for existence 
is only one of the means by which selection may be effected. The endless varieties of 
cultivated flowers, fruits, roots, tubers, and bulbs are not products of selection by 
means of the struggle for existence, but of direct selection, in view of an ideal of 
utility or beauty. Amidst a multitude of plants, occupying the same station and 
subjected to the same conditions, in the garden, varieties arise. The varieties 
tending in a given direction are preserved, and the rest are destroyed. And the same 
process takes place among the varieties until, for example, the wild kale becomes a 
cabbage, or the wild Viola tricolor a prize pansy. 

V 

The process of colonization presents analogies to the formation of a garden which 
are highly instructive. Suppose a shipload of English colonists sent to form a 
settlement, in such a country as Tasmania was in the middle of the last century. On 
landing, they find themselves in the midst of a state of nature, widely different from 
that left behind them in everything but the most general physical conditions. The 
common plants, the common birds and quadrupeds, are as totally distinct as the 
men from anything to be seen on the side of the globe from which they come. The 
colonists proceed to put an end to this state of things over as large an area as they 
desire to occupy. They clear away the native vegetation, extirpate or drive out the 
animal population, so far as may be necessary, and take measures to defend 
themselves from the re- immigration of either. In their place, they introduce English 
grain and fruit trees; English dogs, sheep, cattle, horses; and English men; in fact, 
they set up a new Flora and Fauna and a new variety of mankind, within the old 
state of nature. Their farms and pastures represent a garden on a great scale, and 
themselves the gardeners who have to keep it up, in watchful antagonism to the old 
regime. Considered as a whole, the colony is a composite unit introduced into the 
old state of nature; and, thenceforward, a competitor in the struggle for existence, 
to conquer or be vanquished.  

Under the conditions supposed, there is no doubt of the result, if the work of the 
colonists be carried out energetically and with intelligent combination of all their 
forces. On the other hand, if they are slothful, stupid, and careless; or if they waste 
their energies in contests with one another, the chances are that the old state of 
nature will have the best of it. The native savage will destroy the immigrant 
civilized man; of the English animals and plants some will be extirpated by their 
indigenous rivals, others will pass into the feral state and themselves become 
components of the state of nature. In a few decades, all other traces of the 
settlement will have vanished. 

VI 

Let us now imagine that some administrative authority, as far superior in power and 
intelligence to men, as men are to their cattle, is set over the colony, charged to 
deal with its human elements in such a manner as to assure the victory of the 
settlement over the antagonistic influences of the state of nature in which it is set 
down. He would proceed in the same fashion as that in which the gardener dealt 
with his garden. In the first place, he would, as far as possible, put a stop to the 
influence of external competition by thoroughly extirpating and excluding the native 
rivals, whether men, beasts, or plants. And our administrator would select his 
human agents, with a view to his ideal of a successful colony, just as the gardener 
selects his plants with a view to his ideal of useful or beautiful products. 

In the second place, in order that no struggle for the means of existence between 
these human agents should weaken the efficiency of the corporate whole in the 
battle with the state of nature, he would make arrangements by which each would 
be provided with those means; and would be relieved from the fear of being 
deprived of them by his stronger or more cunning fellows. Laws, sanctioned by the 
combined force of the colony, would restrain the self-assertion of each man within 
the limits required for the maintenance of peace. In other words, the cosmic struggle 
for existence, as between man and man, would be rigorously suppressed; and 
selection, by its means, would be as completely excluded as it is from the garden. 

At the same time, the obstacles to the full development of the capacities of the 
colonists by other conditions of the state of nature than those already mentioned, 
would be removed by the creation of artificial conditions of existence of a more 
favourable character. Protection against extremes of heat and cold would be 
afforded by houses and clothing; drainage and irrigation works would antagonize the 
effects of excessive rain and excessive drought; roads, bridges, canals, carriages, and 
ships would overcome the natural obstacles to locomotion and transport; mechanical 
engines would supplement the natural strength of men and of their draught animals; 
hygienic precautions would check, or remove, the natural causes of disease. With 
every step of this progress in civilization, the colonists would become more and more 
independent of the state of nature; more and more, their lives would be conditioned 
by a state of art. In order to attain his ends, the administrator would have to avail 
himself of the courage, industry, and co- operative intelligence of the settlers; and it 
is plain that the interest of the community would be best served by increasing the 
proportion of persons who possess such qualities, and diminishing that of persons 
devoid of them. In other words, by selection directed towards an ideal. 

Thus the administrator might look to the establishment of an earthly paradise, a 
true garden of Eden, in which all things should work together towards the 
well-being of the gardeners: within which the cosmic process, the coarse struggle for 
existence of the state of nature, should be abolished; in which that state should be 
replaced by a state of art; where every plant and every lower animal should be 
adapted to human wants, and would perish if human supervision and protection 
were withdrawn; where men themselves should have been selected, with a view to 
their efficiency as organs for the performance of the functions of a perfected society. 
And this ideal policy would have been brought about, not by gradually adjusting the 

men to the conditions around them, but by creating artificial conditions for them; 
not by allowing the free play of the struggle for existence, but by excluding that 
struggle; and by substituting selection directed towards the administrator's ideal for 
the selection it exercises.  

VII 

But the Eden would have its serpent, and a very subtle beast too. Man shares with 
the rest of the living world the mighty instinct of reproduction and its consequence, 
the tendency to multiply with great rapidity. The better the measures of the 
administrator achieved their object, the more completely the destructive agencies of 
the state of nature were defeated, the less would that multiplication be checked. 

On the other hand, within the colony, the enforcement of peace, which deprives 
every man of the power to take away the means of existence from another, simply 
because he is the stronger, would have put an end to the struggle for existence 
between the colonists, and the competition for the commodities of existence, which 
would alone remain, is no check upon population.  

Thus, as soon as the colonists began to multiply, the administrator would have to 
face the tendency to the reintroduction of the cosmic struggle into his artificial 
fabric, in consequence of the competition, not merely for the commodities, but for 
the means of existence. When the colony reached the limit of possible expansion, the 
surplus population must be disposed of somehow; or the fierce struggle for existence 
must recommence and destroy that peace, which is the fundamental condition of the 
maintenance of the state of art against the state of nature. 

Supposing the administrator to be guided by purely scientific considerations, he 
would, like the gardener, meet this most serious difficulty by systematic extirpation, 
or exclusion, of the superfluous. The hopelessly diseased, the infirm, aged, the weak 
or deformed in body or in mind, the excess of infants born, would be put away, as 
the gardener pulls up defective and superfluous plants, or the breeder destroys 
undesirable cattle. Only the strong and the healthy, carefully matched, with a view 
to the progeny best adapted to the purposes of the administrator, would be 
permitted to perpetuate their kind.  

VIII 

Of the more thoroughgoing of the multitudinous attempts to apply the principles of 
cosmic evolution, or what are supposed to be such, to social and political problems, 
which have appeared of late years, a considerable proportion appear to me to be 
based upon the notion that human society is competent to furnish, from its own 
resources, an administrator of the kind I have imagined. The pigeons, in short, are 
to be their own Sir John Sebright. A despotic government, whether individual or 
collective, is to be endowed with the preternatural intelligence, and with what, I am 
afraid, many will consider the preternatural ruthlessness, required for the purpose of 
carrying out the principle of improvement by selection, with the somewhat drastic 
thoroughness upon which the success of the method depends. Experience certainly 

does not justify us in limiting the ruthlessness of individual "saviours of society"; 
and, on the well-known grounds of the aphorism which denies both body and soul to 
corporations, it seems probable (indeed the belief is not without support in history) 
that a collective despotism, a mob got to believe in its own divine right by 
demagogic missionaries, would be capable of more thorough work in this direction 
than any single tyrant, puffed up with the same illusion, has ever achieved. But 
intelligence is another affair. The fact that "saviours of society" take to that trade is 
evidence enough that they have none to spare. And such as they possess is generally 
sold to the capitalists of physical force on whose resources they depend. However, I 
doubt whether even the keenest judge of character, if he had before him a hundred 
boys and girls under fourteen, could pick out, with the least chance of success, those 
who should be kept, as certain to be serviceable members of the polity, and those 
who should be chloroformed, as equally sure to be stupid, idle, or vicious. The 
"points" of a good or of a bad citizen are really far harder to discern than those of a 
puppy or a short-horn calf; many do not show themselves before the practical 
difficulties of life stimulate manhood to full exertion. And by that time the mischief 
is done. The evil stock, if it be one, has had time to multiply, and selection is 
nullified.  

IX 

I have other reasons for fearing that this logical ideal of evolutionary 
regimentation--this pigeon-fanciers' polity--is unattainable. In the absence of any 
such a severely scientific administrator as we have been dreaming of, human society 
is kept together by bonds of such a singular character, that the attempt to perfect 
society after his fashion would run serious risk of loosening them.  

Social organization is not peculiar to men. Other societies, such as those constituted 
by bees and ants, have also arisen out of the advantage of co-operation in the 
struggle for existence; and their resemblances to, and their differences from, human 
society are alike instructive. The society formed by the hive bee fulfils the ideal of 
the communistic aphorism "to each according to his needs, from each according to 
his capacity." Within it, the struggle for existence is strictly limited. Queen, drones, 
and workers have each their allotted sufficiency of food; each performs the function 
assigned to it in the economy of the hive, and all contribute to the success of the 
whole co- operative society in its competition with rival collectors of nectar and 
pollen and with other enemies, in the state of nature without. In the same sense as 
the garden, or the colony, is a work of human art, the bee polity is a work of 
apiarian art, brought about by the cosmic process, working through the organization 
of the hymenopterous type.  

Now this society is the direct product of an organic necessity, impelling every 
member of it to a course of action which tends to the good of the whole. Each bee 
has its duty and none has any rights. Whether bees are susceptible of feeling and 
capable of thought is a question which cannot be dogmatically answered. As a pious 
opinion, I am disposed to deny them more than the merest rudiments of 
consciousness. But it is curious to reflect that a thoughtful drone (workers and 
queens would have no leisure for speculation) with a turn for ethical philosophy, 

must needs profess himself an intuitive moralist of the purest water. He would point 
out, with perfect justice, that the devotion of the workers to a life of ceaseless toil 
for a mere subsistence wage, cannot be accounted for either by enlightened 
selfishness, or by any other sort of utilitarian motives; since these bees begin to 
work, without experience or reflection, as they emerge from the cell in which they 
are hatched. Plainly, an eternal and immutable principle, innate in each bee, can 
alone account for the phenomena. On the other hand, the biologist, who traces out 
all the extant stages of gradation between solitary and hive bees, as clearly sees in 
the latter, simply the perfection of an automatic mechanism, hammered out by the 
blows of the struggle for existence upon the progeny of the former, during long ages 
of constant variation. 

X 

I see no reason to doubt that, at its origin, human society was as much a product of 
organic necessity as that of the bees. The human family, to begin with, rested upon 
exactly the same conditions as those which gave rise to similar associations among 
animals lower in the scale. Further, it is easy to see that every increase in the 
duration of the family ties, with the resulting co-operation of a larger and larger 
number of descendants for protection and defence, would give the families in which 
such modification took place a distinct advantage over the others. And, as in the 
hive, the progressive limitation of the struggle for existence between the members of 
the family would involve increasing efficiency as regards outside competition.  

But there is this vast and fundamental difference between bee society and human 
society. In the former, the members of the society are each organically predestined 
to the performance of one particular class of functions only. If they were endowed 
with desires, each could desire to perform none but those offices for which its 
organization specially fits it; and which, in view of the good of the whole, it is 
proper it should do. So long as a new queen does not make her appearance, rivalries 
and competition are absent from the bee polity.  
Among mankind, on the contrary, there is no such predestination to a sharply 
defined place in the social organism. However much men may differ in the quality of 
their intellects, the intensity of their passions, and the delicacy of their sensations, it 
cannot be said that one is fitted by his organization to be an agricultural labourer 
and nothing else, and another to be a landowner and nothing else. Moreover, with 
all their enormous differences in natural endowment, men agree in one thing, and 
that is their innate desire to enjoy the pleasures and to escape the pains of life; and, 
in short, to do nothing but that which it pleases them to do, without the least 
reference to the welfare of the society into which they are born. That is their 
inheritance (the reality at the bottom of the doctrine of original sin) from the long 
series of ancestors, human and semi-human and brutal, in whom the strength of this 
innate tendency to self-assertion was the condition of victory in the struggle for 
existence. That is the reason of the aviditas vitæ--the insatiable hunger for 
enjoyment--of all mankind, which is one of the essential conditions of success in the 
war with the state of nature outside; and yet the sure agent of the destruction of 
society if allowed free play within.  

The check upon this free play of self-assertion, or natural liberty, which is the 
necessary condition for the origin of human society, is the product of organic 
necessities of a different kind from those upon which the constitution of the hive 
depends. One of these is the mutual affection of parent and offspring, intensified by 
the long infancy of the human species. But the most important is the tendency, so 
strongly developed in man, to reproduce in himself actions and feelings similar to, or 
correlated with, those of other men. Man is the most consummate of all mimics in 
the animal world; none but himself can draw or model; none comes near him in the 
scope, variety, and exactness of vocal imitation; none is such a master of gesture; 
while he seems to be impelled thus to imitate for the pure pleasure of it. And there 
is no such another emotional chameleon. By a purely reflex operation of the mind, 
we take the hue of passion of those who are about us, or, it may be, the 
complementary colour. It is not by any conscious "putting one's self in the place" of 
a joyful or a suffering person that the state of mind we call sympathy usually arises; 
indeed, it is often contrary to one's sense of right, and in spite of one's will, that 
"fellow-feeling makes us wondrous kind", or the reverse. However complete may be 
the indifference to public opinion, in a cool, intellectual view, of the traditional sage, 
it has not yet been my fortune to meet with any actual sage who took its hostile 
manifestations with entire equanimity. Indeed, I doubt if the philosopher lives, or 
ever has lived, who could know himself to be heartily despised by a street boy 
without some irritation. And, though one cannot justify Haman for wishing to hang 
Mordecai on such a very high gibbet, yet, really, the consciousness of the Vizier of 
Ahasuerus, as he went in and out of the gate, that this obscure Jew had no respect 
for him, must have been very annoying.  

It is needful only to look around us, to see that the greatest restrainer of the 
anti-social tendencies of men is fear, not of the law, but of the opinion of their 
fellows. The conventions of honour bind men who break legal, moral, and religious 
bonds; and, while people endure the extremity of physical pain rather than part 
with life, shame drives the weakest to suicide. 

Every forward step of social progress brings men into closer relations with their 
fellows, and increases the importance of the pleasures and pains derived from 
sympathy. We judge the acts of others by our own sympathies, and we judge our 
own acts by the sympathies of others, every day and all day long, from childhood 
upwards, until associations, as indissoluble as those of language, are formed between 
certain acts and the feelings of approbation or disapprobation. It becomes impossible 
to imagine some acts without disapprobation, or others without approbation of the 
actor, whether he be one's self, or any one else. We come to think in the acquired 
dialect of morals. An artificial personality, the "man within", as Adam Smith calls 
conscience, is built up beside the natural personality. He is the watchman of society, 
charged to restrain the anti-social tendencies of the natural man within the limits 
required by social welfare.  

XI 

I have termed this evolution of the feelings out of which the primitive bonds of 
human society are so largely forged, into the organized and personified sympathy we 

call conscience, the ethical process. So far as it tends to make any human society 
more efficient in the struggle for existence with the state of nature, or with other 
societies, it works in harmonious contrast with the cosmic process. But it is none the 
less true that, since law and morals are restraints upon the struggle for existence 
between men in society, the ethical process is in opposition to the principle of the 
cosmic process, and tends to the suppression of the qualities best fitted for success 
in that struggle.  

It is further to be observed that, just as the self-assertion, necessary to the 
maintenance of society against the state of nature, will destroy that society if it is 
allowed free operation within; so the self-restraint, the essence of the ethical process, 
which is no less an essential condition of the existence of every polity, may, by 
excess, become ruinous to it.  

Moralists of all ages and of all faiths, attending only to the relations of men towards 
one another in an ideal society, have agreed upon the "golden rule", "Do as you 
would be done by." In other words, let sympathy be your guide; put yourself in the 
place of the man towards whom your action is directed; and do to him what you 
would like to have done to yourself under the circumstances. However much one 
may admire the generosity of such a rule of conduct; however confident one may be 
that average men may be thoroughly depended upon not to carry it out to its full 
logical consequences; it is nevertheless desirable to recognize the fact that these 
consequences are incompatible with the existence of a civil state, under any 
circumstances of this world which have obtained, or, so far as one can see, are likely 
to come to pass. 

For I imagine there can be no doubt that the great desire of every wrongdoer is to 
escape from the painful consequences of his actions. If I put myself in the place of 
the man who has robbed me, I find that I am possessed by an exceeding desire not 
to be fined or imprisoned; if in that of the man who has smitten me on one cheek, I 
contemplate with satisfaction the absence of any worse result than the turning of 
the other cheek for like treatment. Strictly observed, the "golden rule" involves the 
negation of law by the refusal to put it in motion against law-breakers; and, as 
regards the external relations of a polity, it is the refusal to continue the struggle for 
existence. It can be obeyed, even partially, only under the protection of a society 
which repudiates it. Without such shelter, the followers of the "golden rule" may 
indulge in hopes of heaven, but they must reckon with the certainty that other 
people will be masters of the earth.  

What would become of the garden if the gardener treated all the weeds and slugs 
and birds and trespassers as he would like to be treated, if he were in their place? 

XII 

Under the preceding heads, I have endeavoured to represent in broad, but I hope 
faithful, outlines the essential features of the state of nature and of that cosmic 
process of which it is the outcome, so far as was needful for my argument; I have 
contrasted with the state of nature the state of art, produced by human intelligence 

and energy, as it is exemplified by a garden; and I have shown that the state of art, 
here and elsewhere, can be maintained only by the constant counteraction of the 
hostile influences of the state of nature. Further, I have pointed out that the 
"horticultural process" which thus sets itself against the "cosmic process" is opposed 
to the latter in principle, in so far as it tends to arrest the struggle for existence, by 
restraining the multiplication which is one of the chief causes of that struggle, and 
by creating artificial conditions of life, better adapted to the cultivated plants than 
are the conditions of the state of nature. And I have dwelt upon the fact that, 
though the progressive modification, which is the consequence of the struggle for 
existence in the state of nature, is at an end, such modification may still be effected 
by that selection, in view of an ideal of usefulness, or of pleasantness, to man, of 
which the state of nature knows nothing. 

I have proceeded to show that a colony, set down in a country in the state of 
nature, presents close analogies with a garden; and I have indicated the course of 
action which an administrator, able and willing to carry out horticultural principles, 
would adopt, in order to secure the success of such a newly formed polity, supposing 
it to be capable of indefinite expansion. In the contrary case, I have shown that 
difficulties must arise; that the unlimited increase of the population over a limited 
area must, sooner or later, reintroduce into the colony that struggle for the means of 
existence between the colonists, which it was the primary object of the 
administrator to exclude, insomuch as it is fatal to the mutual peace which is the 
prime condition of the union of men in society. 

I have briefly described the nature of the only radical cure, known to me, for the 
disease which would thus threaten the existence of the colony; and, however 
regretfully, I have been obliged to admit that this rigorously scientific method of 
applying the principles of evolution to human society hardly comes within the region 
of practical politics; not for want of will on the part of a great many people; but 
because, for one reason, there is no hope that mere human beings will ever possess 
enough intelligence to select the fittest. And I have adduced other grounds for 
arriving at the same conclusion.  

I have pointed out that human society took its rise in the organic necessities 
expressed by imitation and by the sympathetic emotions; and that, in the struggle 
for existence with the state of nature and with other societies, as part of it, those in 
which men were thus led to close co-operation had a great advantage. But, since 
each man retained more or less of the faculties common to all the rest, and 
especially a full share of the desire for unlimited self-gratification, the struggle for 
existence within society could only be gradually eliminated. So long as any of it 
remained, society continued to be an imperfect instrument of the struggle for 
existence and, consequently, was improvable by the selective influence of that 
struggle. Other things being alike, the tribe of savages in which order was best 
maintained; in which there was most security within the tribe and the most loyal 
mutual support outside it, would be the survivors. 

I have termed this gradual strengthening of the social bond, which, though it arrests 
the struggle for existence inside society, up to a certain point improves the chances 

of society, as a corporate whole, in the cosmic struggle--the ethical process. I have 
endeavoured to show that, when the ethical process has advanced so far as to secure 
every member of the society in the possession of the means of existence, the struggle 
for existence, as between man and man, within that society is, ipso facto, at an end. 
And, as it is undeniable that the most highly civilized societies have substantially 
reached this position, it follows that, so far as they are concerned, the struggle for 
existence can play no important part within them4. In other words, the kind of 
evolution which is brought about in the state of nature cannot take place.  

I have further shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of 
the horticulturist and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important 
part in the evolution of society; apart from other reasons, because I do not see how 
such selection could be practised without a serious weakening, it may be the 
destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. It strikes me that men who 
are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the 
unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has 
the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of 
the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and 
count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial 
undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, 
therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and 
sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, 
without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, 
except the calculation of self-interest, the balancing of certain present gratifications 
against doubtful future pains; and experience tells us how much that is worth. Every 
day, we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as 
they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from 
those which are opposed to the sympathies of their associates. 

XIII 

That progressive modification of civilization which passes by the name of the 
"evolution of society", is, in fact, a process of an essentially different character, both 
from that which brings about the evolution of species, in the state of nature, and 
from that which gives rise to the evolution of varieties, in the state of art. 

There can be no doubt that vast changes have taken place in English civilization 
since the reign of the Tudors. But I am not aware of a particle of evidence in favour 
of the conclusion that this evolutionary process has been accompanied by any 
modification of the physical, or the mental, characters of the men who have been 
the subjects of it. I have not met with any grounds for suspecting that the average 
Englishmen of to-day are sensibly different from those that Shakespeare knew and 

4 Whether the struggle for existence within the state of nature and within other societies, 
so far as they stand in the relation of the state of nature with it, exerts a selective influence upon 
modern society, and in what direction, are questions not easy to asnwer.  The problem of the 
effect of military and industrial warfare upon those who wage it is very complicated. 

drew. We look into his magic mirror of the Elizabethan age, and behold, nowise 
darkly, the presentment of ourselves.  

During these three centuries, from the reign of Elizabeth to that of Victoria, the 
struggle for existence between man and man has been so largely restrained among 
the great mass of the population (except for one or two short intervals of civil war), 
that it can have had little, or no, selective operation. As to anything comparable to 
direct selection, it has been practised on so small a scale that it may also be 
neglected. The criminal law, in so far as by putting to death, or by subjecting to 
long periods of imprisonment, those who infringe its provisions, it prevents the 
propagation of hereditary criminal tendencies; and the poor-law, in so far as it 
separates married couples, whose destitution arises from hereditary defects of 
character, are doubtless selective agents operating in favour of the non-criminal and 
the more effective members of society. But the proportion of the population which 
they influence is very small; and, generally, the hereditary criminal and the 
hereditary pauper have propagated their kind before the law affects them. In a large 
proportion of cases, crime and pauperism have nothing to do with heredity; but are 
the consequence, partly, of circumstances and, partly, of the possession of qualities, 
which, under different conditions of life, might have excited esteem and even 
admiration. It was a shrewd man of the world who, in discussing sewage problems, 
remarked that dirt is riches in the wrong place; and that sound aphorism has moral 
applications. The benevolence and open- handed generosity which adorn a rich man, 
may make a pauper of a poor one; the energy and courage to which the successful 
soldier owes his rise, the cool and daring subtlety to which the great financier owes 
his fortune, may very easily, under unfavourable conditions, lead their possessors to 
the gallows, or to the hulks. Moreover, it is fairly probable that the children of a 
"failure" will receive from their other parent just that little modification of 
character which makes all the difference. I sometimes wonder whether people, who 
talk so freely about extirpating the unfit, ever dispassionately consider their own 
history. Surely, one must be very "fit", indeed, not to know of an occasion, or 
perhaps two, in one's life, when it would have been only too easy to qualify for a 
place among the "unfit". 

In my belief the innate qualities, physical, intellectual, and moral, of our nation have 
remained substantially the same for the last four or five centuries. If the struggle for 
existence has affected us to any serious extent (and I doubt it) it has been, 
indirectly, through our military and industrial wars with other nations.  

XIV 

What is often called the struggle for existence in society (I plead guilty of having 
used the term too loosely myself), is a contest, not for the means of existence, but 
for the means of enjoyment. Those who occupy the first places in this practical 
competitive examination are the rich and the influential; those who fail, more or 
less, occupy the lower places, down to the squalid obscurity of the pauper and the 
criminal. Upon the most liberal estimate, I suppose the former group will not 
amount to two per cent. of the population. I doubt if the latter exceeds another two 

per cent.; but let it be supposed, for the sake of argument, that it is as great as five 
per cent.  

As it is only in the latter group that anything comparable to the struggle for 
existence in the state of nature can take place; as it is only among this twentieth of 
the whole people that numerous men, women, and children die of rapid or slow 
starvation, or of the diseases incidental to permanently bad conditions of life; and as 
there is nothing to prevent their multiplication before they are killed off, while, in 
spite of greater infant mortality, they increase faster than the rich; it seems clear 
that the struggle for existence in this class can have no appreciable selective 
influence upon the other 95 per cent. of the population.  

What sort of a sheep breeder would he be who should content himself with picking 
out the worst fifty out of a thousand, leaving them on a barren common till the 
weakest starved, and then letting the survivors go back to mix with the rest? And 
the parallel is too favourable; since in a large number of cases, the actual poor and 
the convicted criminals are neither the weakest nor the worst. 

In the struggle for the means of enjoyment, the qualities which ensure 
success are energy, industry, intellectual capacity, tenacity of purpose, and, 
at least as much sympathy as is necessary to make a man understand the 
feelings of his fellows. Were there none of those artificial arrangements by 
which fools and knaves are kept at the top of society instead of sinking to 
their natural place at the bottom, the struggle for the means of enjoyment 
would ensure a constant circulation of the human units of the social 
compound, from the bottom to the top and from the top to the bottom. The 
survivors of the contest, those who continued to form the great bulk of the 
polity, would not be those "fittest" who got to the very top, but the great 
body of the moderately "fit", whose numbers and superior propagative 
power, enable them always to swamp the exceptionally endowed minority.  

I think it must be obvious to every one, that, whether we consider the 
internal or the external interests of society, it is desirable they should be in 
the hands of those who are endowed with the largest share of energy, of 
industry, of intellectual capacity, of tenacity of purpose, while they are not 
devoid of sympathetic humanity; and, in so far as the struggle for the means 
of enjoyment tends to place such men in possession of wealth and influence, 
it is a process which tends to the good of society. But the process, as we 
have seen, has no real resemblance to that which adapts living beings to 
current conditions in the state of nature; nor any to the artificial selection of 
the horticulturist.  

XV 

To return, once more, to the parallel of horticulture. In the modern world, 
the gardening of men by themselves is practically restricted to the 
performance, not of selection, but of that other function of the gardener, the 
creation of conditions more favourable than those of the state of nature; to 
the end of facilitating the free expansion of the innate faculties of the citizen, 
so far as it is consistent with the general good. And the business of the moral 
and political philosopher appears to me to be the ascertainment, by the same 
method of observation, experiment, and ratiocination, as is practised in other 
kinds of scientific work, of the course of conduct which will best conduce to 
that end. 

But, supposing this course of conduct to be scientifically determined and 
carefully followed out, it cannot put an end to the struggle for existence in 
the state of nature; and it will not so much as tend, in any way, to the 
adaptation of man to that state. Even should the whole human race be 
absorbed in one vast polity, within which "absolute political justice" reigns, 
the struggle for existence with the state of nature outside it, and the 
tendency to the return of the struggle within, in consequence of 
over-multiplication, will remain; and, unless men's inheritance from the 
ancestors who fought a good fight in the state of nature, their dose of 
original sin, is rooted out by some method at present unrevealed, at any rate 
to disbelievers in supernaturalism, every child born into the world will still 

bring with him the instinct of unlimited self- assertion. He will have to learn 
the lesson of self-restraint and renunciation. But the practice of self-restraint 
and renunciation is not happiness, though it may be something much better.  

That man, as a "political animal", is susceptible of a vast amount of 
improvement, by education, by instruction, and by the application of his 
intelligence to the adaptation of the conditions of life to his higher needs, I 
entertain not the slightest doubt. But, so long as he remains liable to error, 
intellectual or moral; so long as he is compelled to be perpetually on guard 
against the cosmic forces, whose ends are not his ends, without and within 
himself; so long as he is haunted by inexpugnable memories and hopeless 
aspirations; so long as the recognition of his intellectual limitations forces 
him to acknowledge his incapacity to penetrate the mystery of existence; the 
prospect of attaining untroubled happiness, or of a state which can, even 
remotely, deserve the title of perfection, appears to me to be as misleading 
an illusion as ever was dangled before the eyes of poor humanity. And there 
have been many of them.  

That which lies before the human race is a constant struggle to maintain and 
improve, in opposition to the State of Nature, the State of Art of an 
organized polity; in which, and by which, man may develop a worthy 
civilization, capable of maintaining and constantly improving itself, until the 
evolution of our globe shall have entered so far upon its downward course 
that the cosmic process resumes its sway; and, once more, the State of 
Nature prevails over the surface of our planet.
