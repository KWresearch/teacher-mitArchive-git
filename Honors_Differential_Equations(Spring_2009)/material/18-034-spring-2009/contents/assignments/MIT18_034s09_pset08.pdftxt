1.  An n × n complex matrix A is called Hermitian if A = A∗ , where A∗  is the conjugate transpose 
of A. That is, aij  = aj i  for all 1 ≤ i, j  ≤ n. When A is real A∗  = AT  and the terms “Hermitian” and 
”symmetric” mean the same thing.  If �u = (u1 , . . . , un ) and �v  = (v1 , . . . , vn ) are column vectors in 
+ unv¯n  and �u�2  = uu∗ .
· · · 
Rn , then �u�v∗  = u1v¯1  +
If A  =  A∗  show  that  all  eienvalues  of A  are  real.  Furthermore,  if A  =  A∗  then  eigenvectors �u 
and �v corresponding to different eigenvalues λ and µ are orthogonal. That is, �u�v∗  = 0.

3.  (a)  Let  A  be  a  3 ×  3  matrix  with  eigenvalues  λ1 , λ2 , λ3 .  Show  that  the  nonzero  columns  of 
(A − λ2 I )(A − λ3 I ) are eigenvectors for λ1 . 
(b) A 3 × 3 matrix A has characteristic polynomial p(λ) = λ(λ2  − 1).  Find eAt . 
4.  (a) For x�  = 6x + y , y �  = 4x + 3y show that the origin is an unstable node. 
(b) If y = mx is a trajectory, show that m = 1 or m = −4. 
(c) Sketch the trajectories in the (x, y)-plane. 
5.  Repeat Problem 4 for x�  = −3x + 2y , y �  = −3x + 4y . 
6.  Consider the differential equation u��  + p(t)u�  + q(t)u = 0, where p(t), q(t) are continuous func­
tions on some interval of t. 
(a) Let 

u(t) = r(t) sin θ(t),

u� (t) = r(t) cos θ(t). 

Show that 

dθ/dt = cos2 θ + p(t) cos θ sin θ + q(t) sin2 θ, 
(1/r)dr/dt = −p(t) cos2 θ + (1 − q(t)) cos θ sin θ. 

(b) Using  part  (a)  discuss  that  if  q(t)  > p2 (t)/4  then  solutions  are  oscillatory  and  if  q(t)  <  0  then 
solutions are nonoscillatory.
