18.034 Problem Set #1 

1.  (a) Verify  that  y  =  xa  solves  the  differential  equation  x2y ��  = 2y  if  the  constant  a  satisﬁes  the 
equation a2  − a − 2 = 0.  Thus get the two solutions x2  and x−1 .  Note that the ﬁrst is valid on the 
whole interval −∞ < x < ∞ but the second on −∞ < x < 0 or 0 < x < ∞ only. 
This behavior is typical for a broad class of linear homogeneous equations known as equations of 
Euler type.  For this class the substitution y = xa  always lead to an algebraic equation for a. 
(b) The equation x2y ����  = 2y ��  admits a solution y  =  xa , where a  is a nonzero constant.  What are 
the possible values of a? 

2.  Suppose a  function y  =  f (x) satisﬁes  the differential equation dy  = 4y sin 2x dx and  the  initial 
condition y(π) = e. The purpose of this exercise is to ﬁnd y(π/6). 
(a)  Separate  variables  and  integrate  to  obtain  ln y  =  c −  2 cos 2x,  y >  0.  By  use  of  the  initial 
condition show that c = 3, and then get y(π/6). 
(b)  The  initial  condition  y(π) =  e  means  that  x  =  π  corresponds  to  y  =  e.  Likewise,  x  =  π/6 
�  a  dy 
�  π/6 
corresponds to y = a, where a = y(π/6).  Integrating between corresponding limits gives 
e  y 
π 
Evaluate the deﬁnite integrals and solve the resulting equation for a. 
(c) If xdy + 3ydx = 0 and y(−π) = e you can’t ﬁnd y(π). Why not?

4.  (a)  Show  that  y1 (x) = 0  and  y2 (x) =  x3/2  are  solutions  for  x  ≥  0  of  the  differential  equation 
y �  = (3/2)y1/3 .

(b) Discuss  that  all nonnegative  solutions  of  the differential  equation  in part  (a)  starting  at  (0, 0) 
lie between two solutions y1  and y2  and that the solution

for  x < c, 
(x − c)3/2

ﬁlls out the funnel between them. 

5. Birkhoff-Rota, pp.  11, #7.  (Typo.  k  is n.) 
6.  (The Bernoulli equation.)  It is a differential equation of the form y � + p(x)y = q(x)yn  with n = 1
. 
(a) Show that it becomes linear by the change of variable∗ u = y1−n .  (Hint. Begin by dividing both 
sides of the equation by yn .) 
(b) Solve the Bernoulli equation y �  + y = xy3  using the method in part (a). 

∗This trick was found by Leibniz in 1696.
