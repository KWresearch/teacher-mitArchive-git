18.034 Problem Set #4 

1.  (a) Show that if u1  is a solution of the third-order variable-coefﬁcient linear differential equation 
u���  + p1 (x)u��  + p2 (x)u�  + p3 (x)u = 0, 
then the substitution u(x) = u1 (x)v(x) leads to the second-order differential equation for v � : 
1  + 2p1u�
1  + p1u1 )v ��  + (3u��
u1v ���  + (3u�
1  + p2u1 )v �  = 0. 
(b) Verify that u1 (x) = ex  is a solution of the differential equation (2−x)u���+(2x−3)u��−xu�+u = 0. 
Use the method in part (a) to ﬁnd the general solution of the differential equation. 
2.  Find a particular solution of the differential equation 
x 2 u��  + (1 − α − β )xu�  + αβu = x 2f (x) 
(a) when α =� β  and (b) when α = β . 
3.  Birkhoff-Rota, pp.  62, #2. 
4.  (a) Find annihilators of xmeαx , xm sin βx, and eαx cos βx. 
(b) Find the general solution of (D2  + 1)(D − 3)2u = 12e3x (10x + 1). 
5.  Consider the nth order linear homogeneous differential equation

(a) Show that if the differential equation is asymptotically stable then a1 , a2 , 
(b) Show that the converse to part (a) is true if all roots of its associated characteristic polynomial 
are real.  (Hint. Assume it is false, and seek for a contradiction.) 
(c) Show by a counter example that the converse to part (a) is in general false. 
6.  (a) Show that the function y2  is not Lipschitzian on −∞  < y < ∞.  Discuss how this failure of 
the Lipschitz condition is reﬂected in the behavior of the initial value problem 
y �  = y 2 ,
y(0) = y0  > 0. 
(b)  Show  that  the  function  y2/3  is  not  Lipschitzian  in  any  strip  |y |  < h  containing  the  origin. 
Discuss how  this  failure of  the Lipschitz condition  is reﬂected  in  the behavior of  the  initial value 
problem 
y �  = y 2/3 ,

y(0) = 0.
