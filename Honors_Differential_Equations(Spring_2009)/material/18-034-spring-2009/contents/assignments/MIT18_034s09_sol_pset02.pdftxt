1.  y(x) = 

= c2  = 0. 

But  y(x) = 

is  not  diﬀerentiable  at  x = 0. 

−x + c1  x < 0
for  some  c1  and  c2 . 
x + c2 
x > 0 
� 
⇒ c1 
y  is  continuous  at  x = 0 
−x + c1  x < 0
x + c2 
x > 0 
2.  As long as the solution is deﬁned,  y �  = f (y) (y  is never zero by unique­
y 
ness). 
⇒ (log |y |)�  ≤  |f (y)| ≤ M  by  assumption.  Then 
|y(x)| ≤  |y0 |e M x 
(1) 
eM a}.  If
For  a >  0,  consider  the  rectangle  {(x, y) :  x
|
| ≤  a, |y | ≤ |y0 |
the  solution does not  exist on x ∈ (−a, a),  then  |y(a)| = |y0 |e
.  This 
M a 
contradicts  (??). 

3.  Let  α = a + ib,  β  = c + id.  In  terms  of  polar  coordinate  functions, 

y ��  = Im(αβ )

cos(θ) Re((β + iα)eiθ ) 
Re(αe−iθ ) 
So  y ��  changes  signs  at  slopes  −b/a, ∞  and  b−c .

4.  (a)  u  solves  the  DE  y �  + (−b(x) + 2c(x)y1 (x))y + c(x)y2  = 0. 
(b)  y1 (x) = x,  u(x) = −  1  .
