1.  In many applications the input f  and the output y  are related by L2y  =  L1f , where L1  and L2 
are linear differential operators. 
(a) If Pj  is the characteristic polynomial of Lj , j  = 1, 2, show that 
P2 (s)Y (s) = P1 (s)F (s) + P0 (s), 
where P0 (s)is a polynomial depending on the initial conditions of both f  and y . 
(b)  The  null  initial  condition  gives  the  transfer  function  W (s) =  P1 (s)/P2 (s).  If  W (s) =  Lw , 
express y by the convolution theorem. 
(c) We  can have  a  function w  as  in part  (b)  only  if  the degree  of P1  is  less  than  that  of P2 .  Why? 
What happens to the formula of part (b) if P1  = P2 ? 
2.  One method of determining the ratio e/m of charge to mass for an electron leads to the system 
my ��  − H ex�  = 0. 
mx��  + H ey �  = eE , 
The initial values are x(0) = x� (0) = y(0) = y � (0) = 0 and m, e, H, E  are positive constants. 
(a) Solve by the Laplace transform and show that the path of a particle in the coordinates (x, y) are 
given by 
y(t) = E (ωH )−1 (ω t − sin ω t), 
x(t) = E (ωH )−1 (1 − cos ω t),
where ω = H e/m. This is a cycloid generated by a circle of radius E (ωH )−1 . 
(b) How can one determine the system-parameter e/m from knowledge of the path and the values 
E  and H  set by the experimenter?

(a) If U (t) is a fundamental solution and C  is a nonsingular matrix, show that U C  is also a funda­
mental solution. 
(b) If V (t) is a fundamental solution, show that U (t) = V (t)V (t0 )−1  satisﬁes U (t0 ) =  I  and is also 
a fundamental solution.
