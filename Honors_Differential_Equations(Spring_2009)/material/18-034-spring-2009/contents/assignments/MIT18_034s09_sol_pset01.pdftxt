18.034  Solutions  to Problemset  1 

Spring  2009 

1.  (b)	 a = 1  or  a = 4 

4.	

3.	

2.  (a)	 y(π/6) = e2 
(b)  Same  as  part  (a) 
(c)  Because  dx  is  not  integrable  on  any  interval  containing  the  point 
x 
x = 0. 
(a)  y  is  increasing  because  y �  = y2  + 1 > 0.  The  formula  is  obtained 
by  the  separation  of  variables. 
(b)  y(x) = tan(x − c)  is  deﬁned  on  the  interval  (c − π/2, c + π/2). 
(b)  Let  c = sup{x : y(x) = 0}. 
If  c  = +∞,  then  y  =  y1 .  If  c <  +∞,  then  y(x)  =  0  for  x  ≤  c 
and y(x) = (x − c)3/2  for x > c by  the separation of variables and 
uniqueness. 
5.  Let  q(x) = anxn  + an−1xn−1  + . . . + a0 ,  an  = 0 
n  xn−1 + . . . + a0 , (x = 0) 
an  n + an−1
The general solution y(x) = c/x + n+1 x
where  c  is  constant  admits  the  only  polynomial  solution  when  c = 0. 
n u�  + p(x)u = q(x). 
6.  (a)	 1−1 
(b)  y = u−1/2  where  u�  − 2u = −2x  for  y = 0.
