1.  (a)  If V (x, y)  is continuously differentiable,  then each solution curve of  the plane autonomous 
system

lies on some level curve V (x, y) = constant. 
(b) Show that the solution curves of the autonomous system 
y �  = −y(2x 3  − y 3 ) 
x�  = x(2y 3  − x 3 ),
are the curves x3 + y3 − 3cxy = 0, where c is an arbitrary constant.  Sketch typical solution curves. 
2.  Consider the plane autonomous system 
x�  = f (x, y),
where f , g are continuously differentiable. 
(a) If limt→∞ (x(t), y(t)) = (x1 , y1 ), show that (x1 , y1 ) is a critical point.

3.  Find the critical points of the competitive system 
x�  = x(3 − 2x − y),
y �  = y(3 − x − 2y) 
and determine the stability and behavior near the critical points. 
4.  Repeat Problem 3 for the predator-prey equation with self-limiting 
x�  = x(−1 − x + y),
y �  = y(3 − x − y). 
5.  (a) Show  that x�  =  f (x) has an asymptotically  stable  critical point 0  if and only  if 0  <  |x|  < δ 
implies xf (x) < 0 for some δ > 0. 
(b) Show that x�  = f (x) has an asymptotically stable critical point 0 if f (0) = 0 and f � (0) < 0.

(b) Show that the critical point (0, 0) of the plane autonomous system 
x�  = y − x 3 ,
y �  = −x 3 
is stable, although its linearization is unstable.
