18.034 Problem Set #2 

Notation.  �  = d/dx. 

1.	 Let 

f (x) = 

� 
|
| 
for  x = 0,
x/ x
for  x = 0, 
k 
where k  is a constant.  Show that no matter how the constant k  is chosen, the differential equation 
y �  = f (x) has no solution on an interval containing the origin. 
2.  Suppose  that  f  be  a  continuous  bounded  function  for  the  entire  real  axis.  If  f �  is  continuous, 
then show that the nonzero solution of the initial value problem of y �  =  yf (y) with y(0) =  y0  = 0 
exists for all x.  (You may need to assume the uniqueness theorem.  ) 
3.  Brikhoff-Rota, pp.  20, #9. 
4.  (The Ricatti  equation)  It  is  the differential  equation of  the  form y �  =  a(x) + b(x)y + c(x)y2 .  In 
general the Ricatti equation is not solvable by elementary means∗. However, 
(a) show  that  if y1 (x)  is a solution  then  the general solution  is y  =  y1  + u, where u  is  the general 
solution of a certain Bernoulli equation (cf. pset #1). 
(b) Solve the Ricatti equation y �  = 1 − x2  + y2  by the above method. 
5.  Let 

Ly = y ��  + y . 
We are going to ﬁnd the rest solution of the differential equation Ly = 3 sin 2x + 3 + 4ex . That is the 
solution with u(0) = u� (0) = 0. 
(a) Find the general solution of Ly = 0. 
(b) Solve Ly = 3 sin 2x, Ly = 3, and Ly = 4ex  by use of appropriate trial solutions. 
(c) Determine the constants in 
y(x) = c1 cos x + c2 sin x − sin 2x + 3 + 2e x 

to ﬁnd the solution. 
6.  (Euler ’s equi-dimensional equation) It is a differential equation of the form x2y �� + pxy � + qy = 0, 
where p, q are constants. 
(a) Show  that  the setting x  =  et  changes  the differential equation  into an equation with constant 
coefﬁcients. 
(b) Use this to ﬁnd the general solution to x2y ��  + xy �  + y = 0. 
(c) For which values of p,  the general solutions of x2y ��  + pxy �  + 2y  = 0 are deﬁned for the entire 
real axis (−∞, ∞)? 

∗This was shown by Liouville in 1841.
