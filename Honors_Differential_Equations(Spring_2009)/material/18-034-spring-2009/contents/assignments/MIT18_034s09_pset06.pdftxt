(a) Show that the improper integral converges for all r > −1. 
(b) Show that Γ(r + 1) = rΓ(r) for r > 0.  Show that Γ(1) = 1, Γ(1/2) = 
(c) For r > −1 show that L[tr ] = Γ(r + 1)/sr+1 , s > 0 
2.  (a) Find the solution of the initial value problem 
y ��  + ω2 y = h(t) sin t − h(t − c) sin t, 
where c > 0 is a constant and ω2  = 1. 
(b) Show that y(0) = y � (0) = y �� (0) = 0.  Show that y and y �  are continuous at t = c. 
(c)  Show  that  y �� (c+) − y �� (c−) =  − sin c,  which  is  0  if  and  only  if  c  =  nπ  for  n  an  integer.  This 
behavior is explained by that the function h(t − c) sin t is continuous at c if and only if sin c = 0. 
3.  Find the Laplace transform of a full rectiﬁed wave∗  f (t) = | sin t|. 
4.  Find the solution of the initial value problem 
y ��  + y = Aδ(t − c),
y(0) = a,  y � (0) = b, 
where A, a, b, c are constant and c > 0.

(b) Show that y(t) = 0 for t ≥ c if and only if y(c) = 0 and 
a sin c ≤ b cos c. 
A = −  a2  + b2 ,
a sin c ≥ b cos c; 
A =  a2  + b2 ,
To interpret, these amplitudes A and locations of impulse c cancel the oscillation.

Note  that  t  = 0  is a singular point and  thus solutions may become unbounded as  t
