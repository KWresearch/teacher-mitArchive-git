(b)  The  equation  for  v �  reduces  to  (2 − x)v ��� + (3 − x)v ��  = 0,  so  that 
v = −c1xe−x  + c2x + c3 .  Hence,  u = c1x + c2xex  + c3e .

3.  {cos kx, sin kx} is a basis of the homogenous equation.  W (cos kx, sin kx) = 
k .  So the Green’s function is G(x, t) =  1 (cos kx sin kt− cos kt sin kx) = 
k 
1  sin k(x − t).

(b)	 {cos x, sin x, e3x , xe3x}  is  a  basis  of  solutions  of  the  homogenous 
equation.  An  annihilator  for  e3x (10x + 1)  is  (D − 3)2 .  So,  design 
a  particular  solution  as

c1 cos x + c2 sin x + (c3  + c4x + c5x 2  + c6x 3 )e 3x 
A  straightforward  calculation  shows  that  up (x) = x2 (2x − 3)e3x . 
Hence,  the  general  solution  is 
u = c1 cos x + c2 sin x + c3e 3x  + c4xe 3x  + x 2 (2x − 3)e 3x

(a)  p(λ)  is  factorized  in  the  real  ﬁeld  into  λ + a  and  λ2  + pλ + q , 
(a, p, q  ∈ R).  Since  the  equation  is  asymptotically  stable,  a,  p,  q 
are all positive.  This implies that all coeﬃcients of the diﬀerential 
equations  are  positive. 
(b)  Suppose  it  is  not  asymptotically  stable.  That  means  a  ≥  0 is  a 
root  of  the  characteristic  polynomial. 
p(a) = a n  + a1a n−1  + . . . + an  ≥ an  > 0 
which  leads  to  a  contradiction. 
(c)  A  counterexample  is  u���  + u��  + u�  + u = 0.
