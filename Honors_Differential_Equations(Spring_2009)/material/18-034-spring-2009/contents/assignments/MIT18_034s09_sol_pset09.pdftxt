1. Birkhoﬀ-Rota pp. 135-136, Theorem 1 and Example 3. 
Folia of Descartes are in ﬁgure 5.2. 

2.	 (a) Suppose not. This means at least one of the inequalities f > 0, f  < 0, g > 0, g < 0  holds 
at (x1 , y1 ). Without loss of generality, let f (x1 , y1 ) = −2α < 0. (other cases are similar). 
By continuity, f (x(t), y(t)) < −α  for t > T  for some large T > 0. 
Hence, x� (t) ≤ −α  for t > T , and x(t) ≤ −αt + β  for some β  for t > T .

Then x(t) → −∞  as t → ∞, which contradicts that x(t) → x1 .

(b) Without loss of generality, let x0  = y0  = 0. 
Let F (t) = f (xt, yt)  in a disk r < δ  for some δ > 0. Hence r =  x2  + y2 . 
By the Mean Value Theorem, F (1) − F (0) = F � (τ )  for some 0 < τ  < 1. 
And, F � (τ ) = fx (xτ , yτ )x + fy (xτ , yτ )y . 
Since fx  and fy  are continuous, |fx (xτ , yτ ) − fx (0, 0)| < �(r), |fy (xτ , yτ ) − fy (0, 0)| < �(r)

(b) Let E (x) = x2  a Lyapunov function. E (0) = 0  and E (x) > 0  for x = 0

and x  near 0  since f � (0) < 0.

And E˙ (x) = 2xf (x) < 0  for x = 0 
Therfore 0 is asymptotically stable.

6.  (a) In addition to x  = 0, x  =  nπ , n  = 1, 2, 3, ...  are critical points.  Let o <  x(0)| �  1  so

Then (n+1)π  <  |x(t)| <  nπ  for all t since a non-stationary solution cannot pass through

Take xn (0)  =  1  , n  = 1, 2, 3...  . Then xn (t) =  1  for all t.  So ,0 is not asymptotically

The solutions are x(t) = a + bt, y(t) = b. Therefore (0, 0)  is unstable. 
For the nonlinear system, let E (x, y) =  x4  + 2y2 .  Then, E (0, 0)  =  0, E (x, y)  >  0  for

(x, y) = (0
E˙ (x, y) = 4x3 (y − x3 ) + 4y(−x3 ) = −4x6  ≤ 0. So, (0, 0)  is stable.
