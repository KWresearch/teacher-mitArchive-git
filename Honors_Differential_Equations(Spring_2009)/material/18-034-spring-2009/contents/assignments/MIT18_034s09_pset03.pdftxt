18.034 Problem Set #3 

0  and  ω0  is 

1.  This  problem  pertains  to  the  differential  equation  y ��  + ω2y  =  sin ω0 t,  where  ω  =�
close to but different from ω . 
sin ω0 t
(a) Verify that y1 (t) = 
is a particular solution. 
ω2  − ω2 
0 
(b) As ω0  → ω show that one of the initial conditions y1 (0) or y � (0) becomes inﬁnite.

sin ω0 t − sin ω t 
(c)  Check  that  y2 (t) = 
is  the  particular  solution  for  which  the  initial  conditions 
ω2  − ω0
2 
remain ﬁnite as ω0  → ω . 
(d) By  l’Hospital’s  rule  show  that  the  limit as ω0 
ω2y = sin ω t. 
2.  Let f (x) and g(x) be two solutions of the differential equation y �  =  F (x, y) in a domain where 
F  satisﬁes the condition∗: 
y1  < y2 

ω  of y2 (t) gives a particular  solution of y ��  + 

→ 

implies  F (x, y2 ) − F (x, y1 ) ≤ L(y2  − y1 ). 

Show that 

|f (x) − g(x)| ≤ e L(x−a) |f (a) − g(a)| 
if  x > a. 
3.  Very  that  (sin x)/x, x  satisfy  the  following equations,  respectively,  and  thus obtain  the second 
solution. 
(a) xy ��  + 2y �  + xy = 0 
(x > 0), 
(b) (2x − 1)y ��  − 4xy �  + 4y = 0 
(2x > 1). 
4.  (a) Birkhoff-Rota, pp.  57, #4.  (Typo.  I (x) = q − p2/4 − p�/2.) 
(b) Birkhoff-Rota, pp.  57, #7(a).  (Use part (a) instead of #6 as is suggested in the text.) 
(c) Birkhoff-Rota, pp.  57, #7(b). 
5.  Let  (cosh x)y ��  +  (cos x)y �  =  (1 +  x2 )y  for  a < x < b  and  let  y(a) =  y(b) = 1.  Show  that 
0 < y(x) < 1 for a < x < b. 
6.  (a) Birkhoff-Rota, pp.  75, #3, (b) Birkhoff-Rota, pp.  75, #4. 

∗It is called a one-sided Lipschitz condition.
