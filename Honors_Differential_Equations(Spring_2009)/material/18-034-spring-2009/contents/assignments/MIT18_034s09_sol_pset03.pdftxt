5.  Suppose  u(x)  >  1  at  some  point  a < x < b.  Then  u  takes  a  positive 
maximum  >  1  at  a < c < b.  Observe  that  u(c)  >  1,  u� (c)  =  0  and 
u�� (c) ≤ 0. 
At  c,  the  diﬀerential  equation  reduces  to 
(cosh c)u�� (c)  =  (1 + e2 )u(c) 
≤ 0 
> 0 
But  this  is  a  contradiction.

The  case  u(x) < 0  at  some  point  is  completely  analogous.
