***** Course Meeting Times *****
Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session
Recitations: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session
***** Prerequisite *****
Multivariable Calculus (18.02) or other versions of Multivariable Calculus
(18.02A or 18.022 or 18.023 or 18.024).
***** Corequisite *****
Students may take 18.02x and 18.034 during the same semester (in which case,
Single Variable Calculus (18.01) or Single Variable Calculus with Theory
(18.014) is a prerequisite). 18.034 develops theories of ordinary differential
equations, and indeed is recommended for those who have taken 18.014.
***** Course Description *****
The official title of 18.034 is (Honors) Differential Equations. A more
appropriate title would be Ordinary Differential Equations with Theory. This
course covers the same material as 18.03 (Differential Equations) with more
emphasis on theory. In addition, it treats mathematical aspects of ordinary
differential equations such as existence theorems. It shares in its spirit with
the two semester sequence Calculus with Theory I and II (18.014 and 18.024).
Topics include: First and second-order linear equations; nth-order linear
constant-coefficients equations; Green's functions, convolution, Laplace
transform methods; Solutions by power series and the method of majorants;
Systems of first-order equations; Existence, uniqueness and continuity;
Numerical methods; Fourier series methods; Sturm-Liouville theory and
bifurcation theory if time permits.
***** Textbooks *****
[Amazon_logo] Birkhoff, Garret, and Gian-Carlo Rota. Ordinary Differential
Equations. 4th ed. New York, NY: Wiley, 1989. ISBN: 9780471860037.
***** Homework *****
There will be weekly homework sets, which are given out in recitation.
Assignments will be due in the following week. I encourage collaboration in
this course, but students must turn in their own write-ups of all problems and
list on the solution sheet the names of the students worked together. There is
also an optional project.
***** Exams *****
There will be three midterm exams and a comprehensive final exam.
***** d'AIMP applets/CAD/Calculators *****
We will emply a series of specially written JAVAâ¢ Applets, called "d'AIMP
applets" during lectures and recitations. These are linked from the related
resources section. I encourage using the d'AIMP applets or other CAD tools
(computer-aided designs like MathematicaÂ® and MATLABÂ®) for homework
assignments or for your own benefit. However, calculators will not be allowed
during exams.
***** Grading *****
The final grade will be based on a cumulative total of 100% computed as:
            Grading criteria.
ACTIVITIES                    PERCENTAGES
Homework assignments          20%
Two one-hour exams (20% each) 40%
Final exam                    40%
