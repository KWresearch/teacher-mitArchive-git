LECTURE  13.  INHOMOGENEOUS  EQUATIONS 

We discuss various techniques for solving inhomogeneous linear differential equations. 

Ly = y ��  + p(t)y �  + q(t)y 

Variation of parameters:  the Lagrange procedure.  Let us consider the linear second-order differ­
ential operator 
(13.1) 
with variable coefﬁcients. 
If a nonvanishing solution of a homogeneous equation Ly = 0 is known, then the corresponding 
inhomogeneous equation Ly = f  can be solved, in general, by two integrations.  It was discovered 
by Lagrange that if two linearly independent solutions of Ly  = 0 are known, then the inhomoge­
neous equation Ly = f  can be solved by a single integration. 
Let u and v be a pair of linearly independent solutions of Ly = 0, and form the expression 
y = au + bv . 
(13.2) 
If a and b are constant, this represents the general solution of Ly = 0. We will the inhomogeneous 
equation Ly  =  f  by  choosing a  trial  solution of  this  form,  but with a and  b  functions of  t,  rather 
than constants. The method is called the method of variation of parameters. 
Let a and b are differentiable functions of t. By differentiation, 
y �  = (au�  + bv � ) + (a�u + b�v). 

We require 
a�u + b�v = 0 
(13.3) 
so that y �  = au�  + bv � . This simpliﬁes the calculation of the second derivative, and 
y ��  = (au��  + bv �� ) + (a�u�  + b�v � ). 

Therefore, 

Ly = y ��  + py �  + qy = aLu + bLv + a�u�  + b�v �  = a�u�  + b�v � . 
The second equality uses that Lu = Lv = 0. 
Solving Ly = f  in the form in (13.2) then reduces to the linear system 
a�u + b�v = 0, 
a��u�  + b�v �  = f ,

W (u, v), so that we may write them as

Finally, by integration, we obtain the Lagange formula

Lagrange’s procedure extends  to equations of order n and  it  represents an  important advance 
in the theory of differential equations. 
A similar idea already appeared.  For example, when studying the linear ﬁrst-order differential 
equations, we replaced the homogeneous solution ceP  by veP , where v  is a function.

Example 13.1.  Consider the Euler equation 
x 2 y ��  − 2xy �  + 2y = x 2f (x), 
(13.5) 
where the prime denotes the differentiation in the x-variable. 
By the technique discussed in the previous lecture, we compute 
v = x 2 ,
W (u, v) = x 2 . 
u = x, 

x > 0, 

For x > 0, we write (13.5) as

The general solution of (13.5) is y(t) = c1x + c2x2  + yp (x).

we can ﬁnd an integral representation of the initial value problem for Ly = f , where L is given in 
(13.1).

The  method  of  annihilators.  We  introduce  another  method  of  ﬁnding  a  particular  solution  of 
linear inhomogeneous differential equation with constant coefﬁcients. Let 
· · ·

Ly = y (n)  + p1y (n−1)  +
where  pj  are  real  constants.  We  study  the  differential  equation  Ly  =  f ,  where  f  is  a  sum  of 
functions of type

if t � t�  � t2 .

Note  that  these  functions  arise  as  basis  solutions  of  linear  homogeneous  differential  equations 
with  constant  coefﬁcients.  We  ﬁnd  a  differential  operator  A  satisﬁes  Af  = 0,  then  we  reduce 
solving Ly  =  f  to  solving  the homogeneous equation LAy  = 0.  Such an operator A  is  called an 
annihilator of f . 
We illustrate with an example.

Example 13.3.  We consider the differential equation 
y ��  − 5y �  − 6y = tet . 
(13.6) 
Let L = D2  − 5D − 6 = (D − 2)(D − 3). Then (13.6) is written as Ly = tet . 
By the exponential shift law for D , we recognize that tet  is a solution of the differential equation 
(D − 1)2y  = 0.  In other words,  (D − 1)2  is an annihilator of tet .  Applying (D − 1)2  in  (13.6), we 
obtain the homogeneous differential equation 
(D − 2)(D − 3)(D − 1)2 y = 0. 
It is easy to see that et ,  tet , e2t , e3t  form a basis of solutions of the above equation.  Hence, we set 
a solution of (13.6) as 

y(t) = c1e t  + c2 tet  + c3e 2t  + c4e 3t , 

and determine the constants cj . 
Since Le2t  = 0 and Le3t  = 0, moreover, we may set c3  = c4  = 0. Hence, 
y(t) = c1e t  + c2 tet . 

We compute 

Ly = (D2  − 5D − 6)(c1e t  + c2 tet ) = (2c1  − 3c2 )e t  + 2c2 tet  = tet 
to obtain c1  = 3/4 and c2  = 1/2. Therefore, a particular solution of (13.6) is y(t) = 3/4et  + 1/2tet .
