LECTURE  22.  CONVOLUTION

(22.2)	

y(0) = 0. 

Motivation:  buildup of a pollutant  in a  lake.  Let’s  say we have a  lake and a pollutant  is being 
dumped  into  it  at  the  variable  rate  f (t).  The  pollutant  degrades  over  time  exponentially.  If  the 
lake begins at t = 0 with no pollutant, how much is in the lake at time t > 0? 
The small drip of pollutant added to the lake between t1  and t1 + Δt, where Δt small, is f (t1 )Δt. 
−a(t−t1 )f (t1 )Δt, where a > 0 is the decay constant. Adding them 
Later t > t1 , the drip reduces to e

up, starting at the initial time t1  = 0, we obtain that the amount is 
t 
−a(t−t1 )f (t1 ) dt1 .

Integral of this kind is called a convolution. 
We  can  solve  this  problem  by  setting  up  a  differential  equation.  Let  y(t)  be  the  amount  of 
pollutant  in  the  lake at  time  t.  Then,  the amount of  the chemical  in  the  lake at  time  t + Δt  is  the 
amount at time t, minus the fraction that decayed plus the amount newly added: 
y(t + Δt) = y(t) − ay(t)Δt + f (t)Δt. 
Taking the limit as Δt → 0 we obtain 
(cid:2)  + ay = f (t),
y 
It is straightforward that (22.1) gives the solution of the above initial value problem.

The convolution integral.  The convolution of f  and g  is deﬁned as 
t 
f (t1 )g(t − t1 ) dt1 . 
(f  ∗ g)(t) = 
0 
It  gives  the  response  at  the  present  time  t  as  a  weighted  superposition  over  the  input  at  times 
t1  < t.  The  weight  g(t −  t1 ) characterizes  the  system  and  f (t1 ) characterizes  the  history  of  the 
input. To ensure the existence of the integral, in what follows, we assume that f , g ∈ A. 
Example 22.1.  Let f (t) = eB1 t  and g(t) = eB2 t , where B1  (cid:5)= B2  are constants. Then,

It is not a coincidence, but rather, it is a property of convolution, as discussed below. 
The convolution operator acts like ordinary multiplication in that, if f , g , h are admissible then 
(i)  (distibutive) f  ∗ (g + h) = f  ∗ g + f  ∗ h, 
(ii)  (commutative) f  ∗ g = g ∗ f , 
(iii)  (associative) f  ∗ (g ∗ h) = (f  ∗ g) ∗ h.

However, the convolution operator differs from the multiplication operator. For example, f ∗1 =(cid:5)
f  ∗ f  (cid:5)= f 2  in general.

Nevertheless, convolution in the t-domain does corresponds to multiplication in the s-domain. 
Theorem 22.2 (Convolution Theorem).  If f , g ∈ E , then f  ∗ g ∈ E  and L(f  ∗ g) = (Lf )(Lg). 
Proof.  If  f , g  ∈  E ,  then  f  ∗ g  is  continuous  for  all  t  ∈  [0, ∞).  Since  |f (t)|  �  A1eB1 t  and  |g(t)|  � 
� 
A2eB2 t , then 
eB1 t  − eB2 t

|(f  ∗ g)(t)| �

Therefore,  f  ∗ g  ∈ E .  Better yet,  |f | ∗ |g | ∈ E .  In other words, L(f  ∗ g)  converges  absolutely  for

large s. 
For simplicity, let f (t) = 0 and g(t) = 0 for t < 0, so that 
f (t1 )g(t − t1 ) dt1 .

Indeed,  the  lower  limit of  the  integral of  f  ∗ g  can be  replaced by −∞ since  f (t1 ) = 0  for  t1  <  0

and the upper limit can be replaced by ∞ since g(t − t1 ) = 0 for t − t1  < 0. Then,

Convolution  allows  an  easy  passage  from  the  s-domain  to  the  t-domain  and  leads  to  explicit 
solutions for a general inhomogeneous term f (t).

The  tautochrone.  Starting  from  the  rest  state,  suppose  that  a  particle  of  mass  m  slides  down  a 
frictionless curve under gravity as shown in the ﬁgure below. 
The  aim  is  to  determine  the  shape  of  the  curve  so  that  the 
time  of  descent  is  independent  of  the  starting  point.  A  curve 
of  this  kind  is  called  a  tautochrone.  It  comes  from  two  Greek 
words, meaning ”same” and ”time.” The problem was solved 
by the Dutch mathematician Christian Huygens in 1673 as part 
of his theory of pendulum clocks. 
Let y be the height at which the particle starts and let v be the 
speed of the particle at the height z .  The change  in the kinetic 
energy  (1/2)mv2  at  the height  z  is  the  change  in  the potential

When  a  particle  slides  down  a  frictionless  curve,  a  related  question  is  to  ﬁnd  a  path  which 
minimizes the time of descent. The minimizing curve is called a “brachistochrone”.  It is interesting 
that the solution is again a cycloid.  (not a straight line!)
