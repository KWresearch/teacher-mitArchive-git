UNIT VI: THE LINEAR SYSTEMS 

We  study  linear  systems  of  n  ﬁrst-order  differential  equations.  They  are  related  to  ﬁrst-order 
matrix  differential  equations.  When  the  corresponding matrix  is  constant,  then  the  eigenvalues 
and the eigenfunctions of the matrix provide a useful framework to construct the general solution. 
The fundamental matrix is constructed as the exponential matrix. 

LECTURE  25.  LINEAR  SYSTEMS 

(25.1) 

A linear system of n differential equations in n unknowns is

� = a11 (t)y1  +
+ a1n (t)yn  + f1 (t),

� = an1 (t)y1  +
+ ann (t)yn  + fn (t).
yn
Here and elsewhere, �  = d/dt.  In the matrix notation, 
�y �  = A(t)�y + f�(t), 
(25.2) 
where  �y  = (y1 (t), . . . , yn (t))T  and  f�(t) = (f1 (t), . . . , fn (t))T  are  vector-valued  functions  deﬁned 
on  an  interval  t  ∈  I  and  taking  values  in Rn ,  and A(t) = (aij (t))n 
is  an  n × n matrix-valued
i,j=1 
function deﬁned on I . 
A matrix-valued function A(t) = (aij (t)) is said to be continuous, bounded, or differentiable if 
each  element  aij  of A(t)  is  continuous,  bounded  and  differentiable,  respectively.  Differentiation

Let us deﬁne an operator 
L�y = �y �  − A�y . 
(25.3) 
With  this  notation,  (25.2)  is written  as  L�y  =  f�(t).  The  domain  of  the  operator  L  is  the  space  of 
n-dimensional vector-valued functions differentiable on I . 

A(t) dt =

Exercise.  Show that L is linear. That is, 
L(c1�y1 (t) + c2y�2 (t)) = c1L�y1 (t) + c2L�y2 (t). 

Since L  is  linear,  the  fundamental  principle  of  superposition  and  the  principle  of  the  comple­
mentary function and other results for linear operators apply. 

Existence and Uniqueness  result.  If A(t) and f�(t) are continuous and bounded on an  interval I 
containing t0 , then for each �y0  ∈ Rn  the initial value problem 
�y �  = A(t)�y + f �(t), 
�y(t0 ) = �y0

has a unique solution in I . 

Working  assumption.  Throughout  the note  and  the  following notes, A(t)  and  f (t)  are  assumed 
to be continuous and bounded on an interval t ∈ I . 
Linear independence.  The vecotrs �y1 , . . . , �yn  in Rn  are said to be linearly independent if 
· · · 
· · · 
c1�y1  + c2y�2  +
+ cn�yn  = 0 
c1  = c2  =
= cn  = 0.
implies 
Let  Y  = (�y1 , . . . , �yn )  be  an  n × n  matrix  whose  j -th  column  is  y�j .  Then,  �y1 , . . . , �yn  are  linearly 
independent  if and only  if the determinant  |Y |  = 0
.  In  this case, moreover,  these functios form a 
basis for the linear space Rn . 
Similarly,  the  vector-valued  functions  �y1 (t), . . . , �yn (t)  are  said  to  be  linearly  independent  on  the 
interval I  if 
· · · 
· · · 
c1�y1 (t) + c2�y2 (t) +  + cn�yn (t) = 0  on I 
= cn  = 0.
implies  c1  = c2  =
This deﬁnition is more restrictive than that for vectors.  But, if the functions are solutions of linear 
systems of differential equations, then their linear independence can be characterized in terms of 
the determinant of a matrix-valued function, analogous to that for vectors. 
A basis of solutions of 
�y �  = A(t)�y , 
(25.4) 
where  A(t)  is  a  continuous  n  ×  n  matrix-valued  function  on  I ,  is  a  collection  of  n  solutions 
�y1 (t), . . . , �yn (t) so that every solution can be expressed uniquely as their linear combination 
· · · 
�y(t) = c1�y1 (t) +  + cn�yn (t)

for constants c1 , c2 , . . . , cn . 
Theorem  25.1.  Let  �y1 (t), . . . , �yn (t)  be  n  solutions  of  (25.4)  on  I .  Let  Y (t) = (�y1 (t), . . . , �yn (t))  be  the 
n × n matrix-valued function, whose j -th column is yj (t). 
The functions form a basis of solutions if and only if |Y (t0 )| = 0 
at some point t0  ∈  I .  If |Y (t0 )| = 0 at 
a point t0  ∈ I , then |Y (t)| = 0 for all t ∈ I . 
If  |Y (t0 )|  = 0  then  the  column  vectors  in  Y (t0 )  are  linearly  dependent.  Thus,  we  can  ﬁnd 
constants cj  not all zero such that 

· · · 
y(t) = c1�y1 (t) +  + cn�yn (t)
satisﬁes y(t0 ) = 0. Moreover, y(t) is a solution of (25.4). Then, by uniqueness, y(t) = 0 for all t ∈ I . 
That is, the functions are linearly dependent on I . 
Notations.  |Y (t)| = det(�y1 (t)  · · ·  �yn (t)) is called the Wronskian of �y1 (t), . . . , �yn (t). 
If  the columns of Y (t) are  linearly  independent  solutions of �y �  =  A(t)�y  then Y (t)  is called  the 
fundamental matrix for �y �  = A(t)�y .  The fundamental matrix yields the general solution, and hence 
the complete solution, of �y �  = A(t)�y . This proves the assertion. 
Plane autonomous systems.  When n = 2, then the system 
� = a11 (t)y1  + a12 (t)y2 ,
y1
(25.5) 
� = a21 (t)y1  + a22 (t)y2 
� 
� 
y2
is called a plane  system.  In  the matrix notation, we write  it as �y �  =  A(t)�y , where �y  = (y1 , y2 ) and 
a11 (t)  a12 (t) 
Let A(t) =

When aij  are constants, then let φ = y1 . We eliminate y2  from the system, and 
(φ�  − a11φ)�  = a12a21φ + a22 (φ�  − a11φ). 
Thus, we obtain the companion or secular equation 
φ��  − (tr A)φ�  + (det A)φ = 0 
(25.6) 
of (25.5). 
Proposition 25.2.  If  (y1 (t), y2 (t))T  is a  solution of  (25.5),  then both y1 (t) and y2 (t) are  solutions of  the 
secular equation (25.6). 
The proof is easy and it is left as an exercise. 
Conversely,  the  secular  equation  (25.6)  can  be  used  to  solve  the  system  (25.5),  by  ﬁnding  the 
roots of the corresponding characteristic polynomial 
λ2  − (tr A)λ + det A, 
and subsequently (25.5) can be solved.  In this note, we call the quadratic polynomial as the char­
acteristic polynomial of A.

Review  of  linear  algebra.  We  end  this  note  by  listing  notations  and  results  of  linear  algebra, 
useful in the study of linear system of differential equations. 
Let A  = (aij ) be an n × n matrix.  If  the  rows and  the columns of A are  interchanged  then  the 
resulting matrix is called the transpose of A, denoted by AT .  It is immediate that 
(AT )−1  = (A−1 )T , 
(AT )T  = A, 
(AB )T  = B T AT . 
A matrix is said to be symmetric if A = AT . 
|
|
We use  A for the determinant of A.  The (i, j )-minor of A, denoted by Mij ,  is the determinant 
× (n − 1) matrix  obtained when  the  ith  row  and  the  j th  column  of A  are deleted. 
of  the  (n −

Then, by deﬁnition, 
|A| = a11M11  − a12M12  + · · · + (−1)n+1 a1nM1n . 
The cofactor of A, denoted by cof A, is a n × n matrix (cij )n 
, where 
i,j=1
cij  = (−1)i+j Mij .

Then, 

|A| = a11 c11  + a12 c12  + · · · + a1n c1n . 
Finally, the adjugate of A, denoted by adj A, is the transpose of the cofactor matrix 
adj A = (cof A)T , 
(adj A)ij  = cj i .

We state a useful formula 
A(adj A) = (adj A)A = (det A)I . 
(25.7) 
The (i, j ) entry of A(adj A) is in fact the inner product of the i-th row of A and the i-th row of cof A, 
and thus (25.7) is simply the Laplace formula. 

We deﬁne the characteristic polynomial 
pA (λ) = det(A − λI ) 
(25.8) 
of the matrix A. Let 

pA (λ) = (−1)nλn  + p1λn−1  +
It naturally leads to a matrix polynomial 
pA (A) = (−1)nAn  + p1An−1  +
An important property of the adjugate is 
adj A = −((−1)nAn−1  + p1An−2  +
