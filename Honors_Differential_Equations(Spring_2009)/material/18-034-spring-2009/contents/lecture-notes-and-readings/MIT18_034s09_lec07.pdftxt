LECTURE  7.  MECHANICAL OSCILLATION 

The  spring-mass  system  and  the  electric  circuit.  If  a  mass  m  is  attached  to  one  end  of  a  sus­
pended spring, it will produce an elongation, say y0 , which, according to Hooke’s law, is propor­
tional to the force of gravity 

ky0  = mg , 
where  k >  0  is  the  stiffness  constant  of  spring  and  g >  0  is  the 
gravitational  acceleration.  If  an  additional  force  is  applied  and 
the spring is stretched and if the force is then removed, the spring-
mass system will start oscillating. The problem is to determine the 
subsequent motion. 
Let y = y(t) be the displacement of the mass from the rest state 
y0 . The forces exerted on the mass are the force of gravity plus the 
tension in the spring k(y0 + y), which acts in the opposite direction 
to the exerted force. Thus, 
F  = mg − k(y0  + y) = −ky . 
By Newton’s second law of motion we obtain the equation of mo­
tion 

my ��  + ky = 0. 
In a more complete description of the motion of the spring, we 
take into account of the damping effect and the external force.  If the mass is in a resisting medium 
in which the damping is proportional to the velocity y � , and if an external force f (t) is exerted then 
the equation of motion becomes

where r > 0 is the constant of resistance. 
Next, we explore a striking analogy between the spring-mass system and an RLC circuit. 
Let a source of electromotive force be connected in a series with a ca­
pacitor, an inductor, and a resistor.  Let v  =  v(t) measure the voltage 
across the capacitor. By Ohm’s law, the voltage equation is

Both  (7.1)  and  (7.2)  are  linear  second-order  differential  equations  with  constant  coefﬁcients. 
Analysis  of  these  equations  leads  to  the  concepts  of  phase  lag  and  gain,  beats  and  resonance, 
which are subjects of this lecture.

From the last lecture, the general solution of (7.3) is given by 
y(t) = c1 cos ω0 t + c2 sin ω0 t, 
where c1  and c2  are arbitrary constants.  Further, the solution can be written as 
y(t) = A cos(ω0 t − φ), 
and it describes an oscillatory motion, called the simple harmonic motion. Here, A � 0 (or better |A|) 
is called the amplitude, and φ is called the phase lag. The motion is periodic with the period 2π/ω0 .

sence of damping or external forcing, one would expect that the total energy, the kinetic plus the 
potential, remain constant in time. This exercise conﬁrms the expectation.

In this lecture, the forcing term is taken to be a sinusoidal input 
f (t) = A cos ω t  or  f (t) = B sin ω t, 
(7.5) 
where  A, B  and  ω >  0  are  real.  Our  choice  of  input  functions  is  partly  supported  by  that  the 
output of an alternating-current generator is, as a rule, sinusoidal.  But, more important is that an

called the Fourier series.  If we know how a system responds to the particular inputs of the form in 
(7.5) then we can treat an arbitrary periodic input by the general principle of superposition, with 
the help of Fourier analysis.

If ω  is close  to ω0  and  if both are  large,  then  the second  factor  is slowly varying compared  to  the

interference. 
Beats have applications  in  tuning musical  instruments or  radar  technology.  If a  tuning  instru­
ment and a piano string sound simultaneously at nearly the same frequency, the beats allow you 
to tell how far apart the two notes are even.  The slower the beats, the more nearly the string is in 
tune. 
In 1902 the teterodyne method was invented in which a circuit at the receiver generates a signal 
that differs only slightly in frequency from the high-frequency signal of the sender. The difference 
produces  a  frequency  in  the  audible  range.  As  a  spin-off  from  radar  technology,  in  1946,  the 
heterodyne method was  used  to  detect  one-centimeter microwave  radiation  from  the  sun.  This 
experiment marked as a major step in radio astronomy and microwave spectroscopy. 
Resonance.  When ω = ω0 , the system experiences resonance. We consider

t → ∞.  See the ﬁgure below.

Figure 7.5. Resonance. 

The  phenomenon  of  resonance  has  profound  importance  in  engineering.  The  failure  of  the 
Tacoma bridge was explained by some authorities on the basis of forced vibrations. 

When  the  trumpets  sounded,  the  people  shouted,  and  at  the  sound  of  the  trum­
pet, when the people gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed; so every man charged 
straight in, and they took the city.  (Joshua 6:20)
