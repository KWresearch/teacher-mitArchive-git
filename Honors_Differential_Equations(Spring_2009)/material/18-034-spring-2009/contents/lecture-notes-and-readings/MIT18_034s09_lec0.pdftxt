A differential equation (DE) is an equation between speciﬁed derivatives of an unknown function, 
its value, and known quantities and functions. Many physical laws are formulated as differential 
equations. 
Ordinary  differential  equations  are  differential  equations  whose  unknowns  are  functions  of  a 
single  variable.  They  commonly  arise  in  dynamical  systems  and  electrical  engineering.  Partial 
differential equations are differential equations whose unknown depend two or more independent 
variables.  In this course, we focus only on ordinary differential equations. 
The order of a differential equation  is  the  largest  integer n,  for which an n-th derivative occurs 
in the equation. 

NOTAT ION .  We typically use t or x for independent variables and y or u, v  for unknowns, except 
for the plane systems of (parametric curves), for which we use t as the independent variable and 
x and y  for unknowns. We use the prime to denote the differentiation.  For instance, when t is the 
d2y
dy 
independent variable and y  is the unknown, y �  means 
and y ��  means 
dt2 
dt 
In this note, we use t for the independent variable and y  for the unknown.

The most general form of a differential equation of order n is 
· · · 
F (t, y , y � , 
, y (n) ) = 0.
A differential equation of order n is said of normal form if it takes the form 
· · · 
y (n)  = f (t, y , y � , 
, y (n−1) ).
Differential  equations  are  usually  considered  on  an  open  interval  I  =  {t  :  a < t < b}, where 
−∞  �  a < b  �  ∞. A  solution  of  a  differential  equation  on  I  s  a  function  φ(t)  which,  upon 
substitution y = φ(t), y �  = φ� (t), . . . , satisﬁes the differential equation for every t ∈ I . 
A differential equation  is  said  linear  if  it  is  linear  in  the unknown and  its derivatives.  A  linear 
differential equation of order n takes the form 
· · · 
+ pn−1 (t)y �  + pn (t)y = f (t),
p0 (t)y (n)  + p1 (t)y (n−1)  +
where  pj (t),  f (t)  are  continuous  functions  on  an  interval.  It  is  said  homogeneous  if  f (t) = 0. A 
differential equation is said nonlinear if it is not linear. Examples of nonlinear differential equations 
are (y � )2  = t + y and yy �  = t. 
Many problems lead to two or more differential equations in two or more unknowns.  In other 
words, they lead to a system of differential equations.  For example, 
x�  = f (t, x, y),
y �  = g(t, x, y). 
Initial value problems.  Differential equations commonly encountered in applications have inﬁn­
itely many solutions.  For example, y �  =  f (t, y) has a family of solutions y  = φ(t; c) depending on 
one  parameter  c  and  y ��  =  f (t, y , y � )  has  a  family  of  solutions  y  =  φ(t; c1 , c2 )  depending  on  two 
parameters  c1  and  c2 .  These parameters  are  like  constants of  integration,  For  example, we  solve 
the differential equation y ��  = 0 to obtain the family of solutions 
y = c1 t + c2 ,

depending on two constants of integration, c1  and c2 . 
A  simplest way  to determine  the parameters  is  to  specify  the value of y  an  its derivatives at a 
single  point  t0 .  For  example,  y �  =  f (t, y)  with  y(t0 ) =  y0 ,  and  y ��  =  f (t, y , y � )  with  y(t0 ) =  y0 , 
y � (t0 ) =  y1 .  These equations are  called  initial  conditions and  the values yj  are  called  initial values. 
The  reason  for  the  term  “initial value”  is  that  in many problems  t denotes  the  time  and  t0  is  the 
time at which the process starts. 
An Initial value problem consists in ﬁnding the solution (or solutions) of the differential equation 
· · · 
y (n)  = f (t, y , y � , 
, y (n−1) ) 
t � t0
for 

satisfying 

. . .  y (n−1) (t0 ) = yn−1 . 
y � (t0 ) = y1 , 
y(t0 ) = y0 ,
Implicit solutions.  Let us consider the differential equation 
x + yy �  = 0, 
(0.1) 
where �  = d/dx.  Since 

d  (x 2  + y 2 ) = 2(x + yy � )
dx
the function y  =  φ(x) is a solution of (0.1) if and only if x2  + y2  =  c, where c is a constant.  In this 
sense the equation 
x 2  + y 2  = c 
(0.2) 
deﬁnes solutions of (0.1) implicitly (with a function of x and y ). 
For c < 0 the locus of x2 +y2  = c is empty, and it gives no solution. For c = 0 the locus consists of 
√
the single point (x, y) = (0, 0). But, it does not give a solution since it does not give a differentiable 
� 
function.  For c > 0 the solution curve is the circle of radius 
c centered at the origin. 
Solving (0.2) for y , we obtain the (explicit) solution 
y = ±  c − x2 , 
which corresponds to the upper and the lower semicircles. These functions are deﬁned for −√
c � 
√
c,  but  they  are  solutions  of  (0.1)  only  for  −√
√
x 
c.  For,  y �  =  � √
x  � 
− x2  becomes 
c < x < 
inﬁnite at x = ±√
c
The formulation (0.1) breaks down at x = ±√
c. 
c and y = 0 since the points correspond to dy/dx = 
∞. Nevertheless, the geometric interpretation remains meaningful.  In the normal form of (0.1), 
dy 
= − 
x
(0.3) 
, 
dx 
y
y �  means the slope of the solution curve and the right sids gives the value of the slope at the point 
(x, y). At x = ±√
c and y = 0 the slope of the solution curve can be understood as being vertical. 
To  deal  with  this  matter,  note  that  a  curve  in  the  (x, y)-plane  can  be  described  not  only  by 
y  =  φ(x) but also by x = ψ(y).  The equation (0.3) implies that y  =  φ(x), where φ is differentiable 
and  no  solution  curve  of  the  equation  can  contain  a  point  where  y  = 0,  which  would  imply 
dy/dx = ∞. But, in the equation 

dx 
y 
= −
,
dy 
x 
y = 0, which in turn implies dx/dy = ψ � (y) = 0, is permissible. 
Nature has no recognizance of coordinate systems, which merely provide a framework for the 
mathematical description of an underlying reality.  If a problem seems intractable when we insist 
on a  solution  y  =  φ(x),  but  easy when we allow x  =  ψ(y),  it  could mean  that we have made an 
inappropriate choice of independent and dependent variables in the formulation.
