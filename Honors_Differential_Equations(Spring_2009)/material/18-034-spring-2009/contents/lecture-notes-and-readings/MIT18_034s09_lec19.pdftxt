UNIT V: THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM


The method of the Laplace transform enables one to solve initial value problems without going 
through ﬁnding  the general  solution and  then evaluating  the arbitrary constants.  The method  is 
particularly useful in dealing with discontinuous inputs (closing of a switch) and with impulsive 
inputs.  An  integral  expression  known  as  the  convolution  allows  an  easy  passage  from  the  fre­
quency domain (s-domain) to the time domain (t-domain) and leads us to explicit solutions in the 
time domain.  The notions of the transfer function and the pole diagram are of continuing interest 
in engineering.

The Laplace transform of a function f , deﬁned for t ∈ [0, ∞), is the function F (s) deﬁned as 
∞
F (s) = L[f (t)](s) = 
e stf (t)dt =  lim

provided  that  the  limit  exists  for  all  sufﬁciently  large  s.  That  means,  there  is  an  s0 ,  depending 
on  f ,  such  that  the  limit  exists whenever  s > s0 .  The parameter  s  is  in general  considered  to be 
complex, but in these notes it is taken to be real. 
It is named in honor of Pierre-Simon Laplace, who used the transform in his work on probability 
theory.

When  s  = 0,  the  value  of  integral  is  T ,  which  tends  to  inﬁnity  as  T  → ∞.  This  shows  that 
L[f (t)](s) = 1/s for s > 0.

This shows that L[eat ](s) = 1/(s − a) for s > a.

Two notations for the Laplace transform will be used here.  In the ﬁrst notation, the connection 
between a function f  and its transform F  is indicated by lower case and upper case.  In the second 
notation, the Laplace transform of f  is denoted by Lf , where L is the Laplace transform operator. 
As a transform, L is linear. That is, 
L[c1f1 (t) + c2f2 (t)] = c1L[f1 ] + c2L[f2 ] 
for all functions f1  and f2  whose Laplace transforms exist and for all constants c1  and c2 .

Functions of exponential type.  It is noted that whereas f (t) is deﬁned for t  ∈  [0, ∞),  its Laplace 
transform  is usually deﬁned  in  a different  interval.  For  example,  the Laplace  trnasform  of  e2t  is 
only  deﬁned  for  s  ∈  (2, ∞).  This  is  because  the  integral  (19.1)  will  only  exist,  in  general,  for  s 
sufﬁciently large. 
One  very  serious  difﬁculty  with  the  deﬁnition  (19.1)  is  that  this  integral  may  fail  to  exist  for 
every  value  of  s.  For  example,  f (t) =  et2  does  not  possess  a  Laplace  transform.  To  guarantee 
that  the  Laplace  transform  of  f (t)  exists  at  least  in  some  interval  s  ∈  (s0 , ∞),  we  impose  some 
conditions on f (t). 
Deﬁnition.  A  real- or  complex-valued  function  f (t)  is  said  to  be  of  exponential  type,  denoted  by 
f  ∈ E , if 
(i)  on any interval [0, T ], the function is deﬁned and piecewise continuous, that is, f  is contin­
uous except at ﬁnitely many points, and 
(ii)	 |f (t)|  �  AeB t  at  all  points  t  ∈  [0, ∞)  where  it  is  deﬁned  for  some  constants  A  and  B 
depending on f . 
� T
Proposition 19.3.  If f  ∈ E  then its Laplace transform exists for all s sufﬁciently large. 
Proof.  Since f (t) is piecewise continuous,  the integral  0  e−stf (t)dt exists for all T .  To prove that 
�  T 
�  T 
this integral has a limit as T  → ∞ for all s sufﬁciently large, we observe that

Solving  differential  equations.  The  real  usefulness  of  the  Laplace  transform  in  solving  differ­
ential  equations  lies  in  the  fact  that  the  Laplace  transform  of  f � (t)  is  very  closely  related  to  the 
Laplace transform of f (t). This is the content of the following important lemma. 
Lemma 19.4.  If f  is continuous on [0, ∞) and f �  ∈ E  then f  ∈ E  and 
L[f � (t)](s) = sL[f (t)](s) − f (0).

The proofs of f  ∈  E  and  that  integration by parts  is permissible under  the hypothesis are  left as 
exercises.  If |f (t)| � AeB t  and s � B + 1 then the ﬁrst term on the right side of (19.3) at the upper 
limit T  satisﬁes 
|e−sT f (T )| � e(B+1)T AeBT  = Ae−T 
which tends to zero as T  → ∞. Hence letting T  → ∞ in (19.3) proves the assertion.

The  differential  equations  considered  in  the  notes  have  solutions  y  that  are  sums  of  functions 
of the form ctk eλt  with k = 1, 2, . . . .  Therefore the solutions as well as their derivatives satisfy the 
hypothesis of Lemma 19.4. Therefore, 

Ly �  = sLy − y(0). 
This relation enables us to transform an  initial value problem of a differential equation for y  into 
an  algebraic  equation  for  Ly ,  which  is  much  easier  to  solve.  The  theory  takes  its  form  from  a 
symbolic method developed by the English engineer Oliver Heaviside. 
As an example, let us consider the initial value problem 
y �  − y = e t ,
y(0) = 1. 

or 

.

sLy − 1 − Ly = 

Taking the Laplace transform gives

Ly �  − Ly = Le t

Hence, Ly =
s − 1 . This tells us the Laplace transform of the solution y(t). To ﬁnd y(t) 
(s − 1)2  + 
we must  consult  the  inverse  Laplace  transform,  formally  denoted  by  L−1 .  Just  as  Ly  is  expressed 
explicitly  in  terms  of  y(t),  via  (19.1),  we  can  write  down  an  explicit  formula†  for  y(t)  in  terms 
of  Ly .  However,  this  formula  involves  an  integration  with  respect  to  a  complex  variable  and 
it  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  course.  Therefore,  instead,  we  will  derive  several  properties  of 
the  Laplace  transform  operator  in  the  next  lecture which will  enable  us  to  invert many  Laplace 
transforms by inspection, that is, by recognizing “which functions they are the Laplace transform 
of ”. 
The procedure necessitates the following justiﬁcations. 
Theorem 19.5 (Uniqueness Theorem).  If f  and g  are functions of class E  and their Laplace transforms 
agree for all large s, then f (t) = g(t) at all points t � 0 where both functions are continuous. 
The proof depends on another theorem which is of independent interest. 
�  1 
Lemma 19.6.  If q  is continuous for 0 � x � 1, then 
0

Proof of Theorem 19.5.  Given f  and g as in the statement of Theorem 1, let u, v , w with their Laplace 
transforms U, V , W , respectively, be deﬁned by 
u(t) = f (t) − g(t),
0 
By assumption,  then, U (s) = 0  for all  large s,  and our goal  is  to prove  that u(t) = 0 at all points 
of  continuity.  Note  that  V (s) =  U (s)/s  = 0  for  large  s.  Accordingly,  if  v(t) = 0  then  by  the 
fundamental theorem of calculus follows that u(t) =  0 at all points of continuity.  Hence, we will 
work with the continuous function v rather than u. 
For  the constant c  large enough, by  the shift  theorem of  the Laplace  transform, W (s) =  V (s + 
c) = 0 for all s > 0 (not only for large s).  Since u ∈ E  follows v ∈ E , and for large c, it yields 
lim  w(t) = 0.

Equation  (19.5) guarantees  that  q  is  continuous  for  0  �  x  �  1.  Since W (s) = 0  for  all  s  �  0, we 
� 
certainly have W (s) = 0 for s = 1, 2, 3, . . . . Then the assertion follows from Lemma 19.6. 
Proof of Lemma 19.6.  Suppose  q(x0 ) =�
0  at  some  point  in  (0, 1).  We may  assume  that  q(x0 )  >  0. 
Continuity then gives positive constants �, δ such that 
|x − x0 | � 2δ 
implies  q(x) � �.

Let m be an arbitrary positive integer and deﬁne 
p(x) = 1 + 4δ2  − (x − x0 )2 ,
0 
By the binomial theorem pm  is a polynomial in x, and hence Im  = 0 under the hypothesis. 
On the other hand Im  = J1 + J2 + J3 , where J1 , J2 , J3  are integrals over the part of [0, 1] in which 
|x − x0 | < δ, 
δ � |x − x0 | � 2δ, 
|x − x0 | > 2δ, 
respectively. On these three intervals we have 
p(x) � 1 + 3δ2 ,
and also, if M  is a sufﬁciently large constant, 
q(x) � �, 
q(x) � �, 

|q(x)| � M . 

|p(x)| � 1 

p(x) � 1, 

Im  = 

p m (x)q(x)dx. 

It is easy to check that 

J3  � −M . 
J2  � 0,
J1  � (1 + 3δ2 )m δ�, 
The  ﬁrst  expression  tends  to  inﬁnity  as  m  → ∞,  and  hence  IM  → ∞.  This  contradicts  that 
� 
Im  = 0. 
Example 19.7.  Solve the initial value problem 
y ��  + 4y = 0,
SO LU T ION .  Taking the transform gives 
s 2Ly − 5s − 6 + 4Ly = 0. 

y � (0) = 6. 

y(0) = 5,

Hence,
