LECTURE  9.  SEPARATION AND  COMPARISON  THEOREMS 

Many  references  encourage  the  impression  that  computing  the Wronskian  of  two  functions  is 
a  good way  to  determine whether  or  not  they  are  linearly  independent.  But,  two  functions  are 
linearly dependent if one is a multiple of the other; otherwise they are linearly independent.  It is 
fairly easy to see by inspection, without computing the Wronskian. 
Nevertheless, the Wronskian has an important application in deriving properties of solutions of 
y ��  + p(t)y �  + q(t)y = 0, 
(9.1) 
where p(t), q(t) are continuous. 

Separation and comparison theorems.  To motivate, we consider the Airy equation 
y ��  − ty = 0, 
t < 0. 
(9.2) 
The equation looks like the equation of simple harmonic motion 
y ��  + ω2 y = 0 
except  that  the  frequency keeps  increasing with t.  More precisely, −t  in  (9.2)  is  in  the position of 
√−tt  and 
the  frequency  ω2 ,  so  near  a  given  value  of  −t,  we  expect  solutions  to  behave  like  cos 
√−tt.  They are, of course, not solutions of (9.2), but still, they give us a hint of what to expect. 
sin 
Indeed, the (normalized) pair of solutions of (9.2), called the Airy cosine and sine functions behave 
as in the ﬁgure below.

In fact, all nontrivial solutions of (9.1) have essentially the same number of oscillation (or zeros). 
Theorem 9.1 (Sturm Separation Theorem).  If u and v are linearly independent pair of solutions of  (9.1), 
then  u must  vanish  at  one  point  between  two  successive  zeros  of  v .  In  other words,  the  zeros  of  u  and  v 
occur alternately. 
Proof.  Let t1  and t2  be successive zeros of v . That is, v(t1 ) = v(t2 ) = 0 but v(t) = 0 
on (t1 , t2 ).  Since 
u  and  v  are  linearly  independent,  their Wronskian W (t)  :=  W (u(t), v(t))  is  never  zero.  Assume 
W (t) > 0 for all t; the case W (t) < 0 can be treated similarly. Then, 
W (tj ) = u(tj )v � (tj ) > 0,
j  = 1, 2.

Since t1  and t2  are successive zeros of v , it must hold that v � (t1 ) and v � (t2 ) have opposite signs. 
Indeed,  if v  increases at t1  then  it must decrease at t2 , and vice versa.  Thus, u(t1 ) and u(t2 ) must 
have opposite  signs.  By  the  intermediate value  theorem,  then,  u must vanish between  t1  and  t2 . 
� 
This completes the proof. 
A reﬁnement of the above argument can be used a more useful result. 
Theorem 9.2 (Sturm Comparison Theorem).  Let 
u��  + p(t)u = 0  and  v ��  + q(t)v = 0, 
(9.3) 
and let p(t) and q(t) are continuous and p(t) �  q(t).  Then u vanishes at least once between any two zeros 
of v , unless p(t) ≡ q(t) and u is a constant multiple of v . 
Proof.  Let  t1  and  t2  be  successive  zeros  of  v  so  that  v(t1 ) =  v(t2 ) = 0  but  v(t)  �= 0  on  (t1 , t2 ). 
Suppose that u failed to vanish on t  ∈  (t1 , t2 ).  Without loss of generality, we assume that u and v 
are positive on t ∈ (t1 , t2 ). 
We compute 
W (u, v ; t1 ) = u(t1 )v � (t1 ) � 0  and  W (u, v ; t2 ) = u(t2 )v � (t2 ) � 0. 
(9.4) 
On the other hand, since u, v > 0 and q � q on the interval (t1 , t2 ) , we have

d

W (u, v ; t) = uv ��  − u��v = (p − q)uv � 0 
t ∈ (t1 , t2 ). 
dt 
The  second  equality  uses  (9.3).  It  implies  that W (t)  is  a  nonincreasing  function  of  t,  and  it  con­
tradicts with  (9.4),  unless  p(t)  ≡  q(t)  on  t  ∈  (t1 , t2 ).  In  this  event,  u(t) =  cv(t)  for  some  c.  This 
� 
completes the proof. 
Applications.  We show that if q(t) � 0 then no nontrivial solution of 
y ��  + p(t)y = 0 
(9.5) 
can  have  more  than  one  zero.  If  not,  by  the  Sturm  comparison  theorem,  the  solution  v  ≡  1  of 
the differential equation y ��  = 0 would have to have at least one zero between any two zeros of a 
nontrivial solution of (9.5). 
Similarly, if q(t) �  k2  >  0 then any solution of (9.5) must vanish between two successive zeros 
of any given solution A cos(kt − t1 ) of the differential equation y �� + k2u = 0, hence in any interval 
of length π/k .

Note that v vanishes when y does, and vice versa. 
We apply the Sturm comparison theorem to (9.2) and u��  + u  = 0 to state that:  each  interval of 
length  π  in  the  half-line  t >  0  contains  at  least  one  zero  of  an  solution  of  the  Bessel  equation  of 
order zero, and at most one zero of any nontrivial solution of the Bessel equation of order n where 
n > 1/2.

The Sturm comparison theorem extends to “self-adjoint” equations. 
Theorem 9.3 (Extended Sturm Comparison Theorem).  Let 
(p1 (t)u� )�  + q1 (t)u = 0, 
(p2 (t)v � ) + q2 (t)v = 0 
and let p1 (t) �  p2 (t) >  0 and q2 (t) �  q1 (t).  Then, between any two zeros of a nontrivial solution u(t) of 
the ﬁrst equation, there lies at least one zero of any real solution of the second equation, except when u = cv 
for some c. 
R 
Exercise.  Show that by substitution v = e  pdt/2y , the equation 
(p(t)y � )�  + q(t)y = 0 

becomes 

v ��  + (q(t) − p 2 (t)/4 − p� (t)/2)v = 0.
