Properties of Laplace transform.  We derive several important properties of Laplace transforms. 
Theorem 20.1.  Let L[f (t)](s) = F (s).  For f  ∈ E , 
(i)  (s-shift) L[e−ctf (t)] = F (s + c). 
(ii)  (t-shift) L[f (t − c)] = e−scF (s) if c � 0 and f (t) = 0 for t < 0. 
(iii)  (s-derivative) L[tf (t)] = −F � (s).

Generalized solutions.  We study 
· · · 
P (D)y  := y (n)  + a1y (n−1)  +
+ any = f (t),
(20.1) 
where aj  are  constants  and  f  ∈  E .  That  is,  f  is  allowed  to have discontinuities.  a very  effective 
method of dealing with such problems.  First, we must come to grips with the following. 
Theorem 20.6.  Let n �  1 and t  ∈  I  be an open interval.  If f  has a simple discontinuity at some point in 
I , then (20.1) has no classical solution on I . 
At a simple discontinuity the left limit and the right limit exist but they do not agree.  A classical 
solution on I  is a function y = φ(t) which satisﬁes the differential equation at every point of I . The 
condition n  �  1 ensures that (20.1) actually involves differentiation.  The proof uses a theorem of 
Darboux and it is omitted here. 
Here  we  extend  the  notion  of  “solution”  to  allow  discontinuous  inputs  and  we  develop  the 
theory of the Laplace transform within the context of the extension. 
Deﬁnition 20.7.  A function y = φ(t) is called a generalized solution of (20.1) on the interval I  if 
(i)  φ, φ� , . . . , φ(n−1)  are continuous on I , and 
(ii)  P (D)φ(t) = f (t) on I  wherever f  is continuous.

The condition (i) means all bad behaviors of f  are absolved by φ(n) . At discontinuities of f , the 
equation may fail.  y (n)  doesn’t need to exist. 

Exercise. Establish the existence and uniqueness theorem of the initial value problem of (20.1) and 
y(0) = y0 , y � (0) = y1 , . . . , y (n−1) (0) = yn−1 , where f  ∈ E  in the class of generalized solutions. 

Theorem 20.8.  If y  is a generalized solution of  (20.1) on t ∈ [0, ∞) and f  ∈ E , then y , y � , . . . , y (n)  ∈ E . 
Sketch of proof.  First,  show  that  the  class � E  �is  closed  under  addition, multiplication,  and  integra­
tion. That is, if f , g ∈ E , then f  + g , f g ,  f ,  g ∈ E . 
� 
Next, if P (D) = D − a, then the solution of P (D) = f  is given by 
t 
e−asf (s) ds + ce at . 
y(t) = e at 
0 
Therefore, if f  ∈ E  then y ∈ E . To show that the derivative belongs to E , we write the equation as 
y �  = f  − p0y .  Since f , y ∈ E , so is y � . 
� 
Finally, we use induction on n. 

The transformed equation.  Let us consider 
+ any = f  ∈ E , 
· · · 
P (D)y  := y (n)  + a1y (n−1)  +
(20.2) 
where aj  are constants. The characteristic polynomial of P (D) is 
· · · 
P (s)  := s(n)  + a1s(n−1)  +
+ an .
When f  has a discontinuity, then the word “solution” will be used to mean “generalized solution”. 
Using the formula 

L[f (n) (t)](s) = s  L[f (t)](s) − s n−1f (0) − · · · − f (n−1) (0) 
n
recursively, the Laplace transform of (20.2) gives, 
s nLy − (s n−1 y0  +
+ yn−1 ) + a1s n−1Ly − a1 (s n−2 y0  +
· · · 
which can be written as 

+ yn−2 ) +  + anLy = Lf , 
· · · 
· · · 

Y (s) = 

P (s)Y (s) = F (s) + P0 (s), 
where Y (s) = Ly , F (s) = Lf , and P0  is a polynomial of degree � n − 1 whose coefﬁcients depend 
on the initial conditions. A formula of P0  is readily obtained by (19.4). Therefore, we arrive that 
F (s)  P0 (s)
+ 
P (s) 
P (s) 
Then, by ﬁnding the inverse transform of Y (s) we obtain the solution of (20.2). 
Suppose that the inhomogeneous term f (t) is a ﬁnite sum of functions of the form 
tm e at (A cos bt + B sin bt), 
where m  �  0  and  a, b, A, B  are  constants.  Inputs  of  this  type  are  encountered  frequently  and  in 
diverse contexts.  The Laplace transform of f (t) is a sum of rational functions, that is, quotients of 
two polynomials.  For example, L[tmeat ] = m!/(s − a)m+1 .  The discussion above then tells us that 
the Laplace transform of the output y(t) is again a sum of rational functions. 
When F (s)  is a  rational  function,  the basic method of  recovering  f (t), where Lf (t) =  F (s),  is 
by expanding F (s) into partial fractions.
