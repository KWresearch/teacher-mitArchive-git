LECTURE  21.  STEP  FUNCTIONS 

Step and impulse signals: motivation.  In the analysis of 
P (D)y := y (n)  + a1y (n−1)  + · · · + any = f 
we often view the differential equation as an input-output system, as shown below.

Figure 21.1. The input-output system. 

Coefﬁcients of P (D) are parameters of the system, e.g.  the spring constant in a spring-mass system 
or  the  resistance  in  the  circuit  analysis.  In  real  life, we  do  not  know  the  parameters  in  advance. 
Instead, we learn about the system by watching how it responds to various input signals. 
The  simpler  the  input  signal  is,  the  clearer  we  should  expect  the  signature  of  the  system  pa­
rameters to be, and the easier we predict how the system will respond to other more complicated 
signals.  The  simplest  is  the  null  signal,  which  corresponds  to  the  homogeneous  equation.  We 
study  two  other  standard  and  very  simple  signals:  the  unit  step  function  and  the  unit  impulse. 
Here, we study step signals.  Impulsive signals will be discussed in later lectures.

Step Signals.  The unit step function or the Heaviside∗  unit function is deﬁned as 
0, 
t < 0
h(t) =  1,
t � 0. 
It has a jump discontinuity at t = 0. The graph of h(t) is given below.

The unit  step  function  is used  to describes various discontinuous  inputs.  If f (t) is deﬁned  for 
t �  0 and  c �  0,  then  f (t)h(t − c) agrees with  f (t) for  t �  c and  is  zero  for  t < c. If  0  �  a < b

then f (t)h(t − a) − f (t)h(t − b) agrees with f (t) on the  interval  [a, b) and  is zero elsewhere.  This 
function describes the effect of closing a switch at time t = a and opening it at t = b. Lastly, if c � 0 
the f (t − c)h(t − c) is obtained by moving the graph of f over by c to the right.  More precisely, if 
g(t) = f (t − c)h(t − c) then g(t) agrees with f (t) for t � c and is zero for t < c. These functions are 
shown in the ﬁgure below.

One of the main uses of the unit step function is in connection with the t-shift property 
L[f (t − c)] = e 
−scF (s),
c � 0 
which  requires  the  condition  f (t) = 0  for  t <  0.  Using  the  unit  step  function,  alternatively,  we 
may write this as 
L[f (t − c)h(t − c)] = e 
−scF (s),

Periodic functions.  Let f  ∈ E  be a periodic function of period p >  0.  That is, f (t + p) =  f (t) for 
all t. The function 
f0 (t) = f (t)h(t) − f (t)h(t − p) 
(21.3) 
agrees with f (t) on the interval t ∈  [0, p) and is zero elsewhere.  In this sense, f0  represents f  on a 
single period, and f  is the periodic extension of f0 . 
Since  f  is  periodic,  we  can  replace  f (t)  in  the  second  term  of  (21.3)  by  f (t −  p).  Taking  the

transform, then gives Lf0  = Lf  − e
