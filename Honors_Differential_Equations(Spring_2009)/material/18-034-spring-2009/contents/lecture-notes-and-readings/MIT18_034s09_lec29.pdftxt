LECTURE  29.  PHASE  PLANES  I 

In the theory of u��  = f (t, u, u� ), linear or nonlinear, u(t) often describes the position at time t of 
a point moving on the u axis and v(t) = u� (t) describes the velocity at time t of the point. Together, 
(u(t), v(t)) determines the status of the system. 
The behavior of  the  system  can be described by  the  locus of  the point  (u(t), v(t))  in  the  (u, v)­
plane.  The (u, v)-plane associated to a differential equation this way is called the phase plane.  The 
(parameterized) solution curve (u(t), v(t)) is called a trajectory, and its image is called an orbit or a 
trace. The main difference between a trajectory and an orbit is that the trajectory is equipped with 
the parameter t, which gives the orientation of the curve. 
In this note and the following, we study the qualitative behavior of the second-order (linear) dif­
ferential equations or, more generally, the system of two (linear) differential equations by plotting 
the trajectories in the phase plane. 
In the simplest case, 

u��  + pu�  + qu = 0, 
p, q are constants,

The origin (x(t), y(t)) ≡  0 is always a solution of (29.2), called a critical point, a stationary solu­
tion, or an equilibrium of (29.2).  If A is non-singular, that is |A| = 0
, then (0, 0) is the only critical 
point of (29.2). The case |A| = 0 is called degenerate. 
Let

p(λ) = λ2  − (tr A)λ + det A =: λ2  + pλ + q

be  the  characteristic  polynomial  of  A.  The  secular  equation  of  (29.2)  is  (29.1),  and  it  establishes 
a  connection  between  a  linear  plane  autonomous  system  (29.2)  and  its  associated  second-order 
linear differential equation. 
We say  (29.2)  is asymptotically stable  if all solutions  tend  to zero as t → ∞,  stable  if all solutions 
remain bounded as t → ∞, and unstable otherwise.

That is, linearly equivalent systems are associated with similar matrices A and KAK −1 . Therefore, 
we may reduce a linear autonomous system (29.2) to a standard simpliﬁed “canonical” form under 
linear equivalence. 
Theorem  29.1.  Unless �  =  (trA)2  − 4 det A  = 0,  the  system  (29.2)  is  equivalent  to  another  system  if 
and only if they have the same secular equation. 
Lemma 29.2.  Two linearly equivalent systems have the same secular equation.

Proof.  Let’s  say  two  equivalent  systems  are  described  by  the  matrices  A  and  B ,  and  let  B  =

KAK −1 . We compute

pB (λ) =|B − λI | = |KAK −1  − λI | 
=|KAK −1  − K (λI )K −1 | = |K (A − λI )K −1 | = |K | |A − λI | |K |−1 
=pA (λ). 
That is, their secular equations have the same characteristic polynomial. This completes the proof.

Lemma 29.3.  Unless a = d and b = c = 0, the system (29.2) is linearly equivalent to

Then, 

u�  = x�  = ax + by = v , 
v �  = ax�  + by �  = av + b(cx + dy) = (a + d)v − (ad − bc)u. 
�

The second equation uses that u =  x satisﬁes the secular equation u��  + pu�  + qu = 0.  This shows

that KAK −1  = 
−q  −p 
. 
, similarly, we try the transformation u = y , v = cx + dy . 
If c = 0
Finally, if a =�
d and b = c = 0, we try u = x + y , v = ax + by .

Classiﬁcation.  We use the results in the previous subsections to study the behavior of (29.2). Let

Focal  points.  If �  <  0,  then  p(λ)  has  two  distinct  complex  roots,  say  α ± iβ ,  where  α, β  ∈  R  and

β  = 0.  In this case, we choose the canonical form

which has the same secular equation. The canonical form is easy to solve and it has solutions 
u(t) = c1e αt cos β t, 
v(t) = c2e αt sin β t. 
The solution of the canonical system satisﬁes 
(u/c1 )2  + (v/c2 )2  = e 2αt . 
(29.3) 
If,  in  addition  α  =�
0,  then  the  locus  (u(t), v(t))  represents  a  spiral.  In  fact,  when  t  increases  by 
2π/β ,  the  point  (u, v)  returns  to  the  same  radial  line  from  which  it  started,  but  the  exponential 
factor multiplies its distance to the origin by e2πα/β . The critical point thus is called a focus. 
When p = −2α >  0, the curve (u(t), v(t)) spirals toward to the origin, and we say the origin is 
a stable focus. When p < 0, the curve diverges from the origin and it is an unstable focus. 
Vortex points.  If α  = 0,  or equivalently,  p  = 0,  but β  =�
0  in  the above  situation,  then  (29.3) gives 
that  the  locus  (u(t), v(t))  is  an  ellipse.  In  this  case we  say  that  the origin  is a  vortex  point.  In  this 
case, each orbit is bounded, and hence the origin is neutrally stable.

Nodal points.  If � > 0 and q > 0, then p(λ) has two distinct real roots of the same sign, say λ1  and

λ2 . Let 0 < |λ1 | < |λ2 |. We choose the canonical form to be

It is immediate that the canonical system has the solutions 
v(t) = c2e λ2 t . 
u(t) = c1e λ1 t ,
By eliminating t from the above, we obtain 
v = kum ,
m = λ2/λ1  > 0, 
and these curves in the (u, v)-plane resemble the parabolas v = ku2 .  In this case, we say the origin 
is a nodal point. 
If p >  0,  that is,  if λ1  and λ2  are negative,  then  it gives a stable node, and  if p <  0 then  it gives 
an unstable node.

They  resemble  the  hyperbolas  uv  =  k .  We  say  the  origin  is  a  saddle.  A  saddle  point  is  always 
unstable, as in one principal direction the solution curves move toward the origin but in the other 
principal direction they move away from the origin.

the origin  is an unstable note and a saddle,  respectively.  The roots of  their characteristic polyno­
mials are 2, 7 in the ﬁrst case and −2, 3 in the second. Thus, the solutions may be written as 
x = ke−2t 
x = ke2t 
x = ke7t 
x = ke3t 
y = −4x
y = 3x, 
2y = x
y = x

In  the  ﬁrst  case,  x|  and  |y |  increase  with  t  since  the  exponents  are  positive  and  the  lines  are

29.2. 
In  the second case  the  line 2y  =  x  is associated with  the negative exponent −2 and  is directed 
toward the origin, while the other line is directed away from the origin.  See Figure 29.3. 
The additional information helps to sketch the trajectories more precisely.
