provided that x  (cid:2)
= 0 and ax + by = 0
.
It  is  readily  seen  from  (30.2)  that  if  y/x  is  constant  then  dy/dx  is  constant.  That means,  at  all 
points  on  y  =  mx,  where  m  is  a  constant,  the  orbits  passing  through  the  points  have  the  same 
slope.  Such a line y = mx is called an isocline of (30.1). The word “iso” means “same”. 
On the x-axis (y  = 0),  the slope of the orbits of (30.1) is c/a.  Therefore,  the x-axis is an isocline 
of (30.1).  Similarly, the y -axis is an isocline of (30.1).  Indeed, on the y -axis (x = 0), the slope of the 
orbits  is d/b.  Other useful  isoclines are  the  line ax + by  = 0, on which  the slope  is ∞,  that  is,  the 
orbit is vertical, and the line cx + dy = 0, on which the orbits are horizontal. 
An isocline is not a solution of (30.1). But, if 
c + dm 
m = 
, 
a + bm
then y = mx is a solution of (30.1). The condition is equivalent to that m is a root of 
bm2  + (a − d)m + c = 0.

(30.3) 
Assume  b  (cid:2)
.  (If  b  = 0 then  x  = 0 is  an  orbit which  corresponds  to m  =  ∞.  See  the  exercise

= 0
below.) The discriminant (cid:4) = (a − d)2 − 4bc of (30.3) is the discriminant of pA (λ) = λ2 − (a + d)λ + 
(ad − bc).  Hence,  there are  two straight-line orbits y  = mx  in case of a node or a saddle  ((cid:4)  >  0) 
but no straight-line orbits in case of a focus ((cid:4) < 0). 
Exercise.  If  m  solves  bm2  + (a − d)m + c  = 0,  then  show  that  a + bm  solves  the  characteristic 
equation λ2  − (a + d)λ + (ad − bc) = 0. 
If y  = mx  is a solution of  (30.1)  then x�  = x(a + bm),  and hence, x  = ce(a+bm)t .  Therefore,  the 
sign of a + bm determines whether  the orbit y  = mx moves  toward  the origin or away  from  the 
origin.  If a + bm < 0 then the orbit y = mx is oriented toward the origin and if a + mb > 0 then it 
is away from the origin. 

Exercise.  For the system 
with a  (cid:2)= d, show that

Degenerate cases.  We now consider the limiting or degenerate cases which fall outside of the six 
regions in Figure 30.1. 

Degenerate  nodes.  Suppose  p2  = 4q  and  p  = 0
,  and  suppose  it  does  not  happen  that  a  = d  and 
b  = c  = 0.  Then,  p(λ) has  only  one  (double)  root, −p/2.  This  case may  be  thought  of  two  roots 
with the same sign, but it happens that the two roots coincide. Hence, we expect that the behavior 
c + dm
of the orbits are similar to the case of a node.  The difference, though, is that m = 
has one 
a + bm 
solution  and  hence  the  two  straight-line  orbits  coincide.  Thus,  the  orbits  are  tangent  to  a  line  at 
the origin and almost parallel to the same line at the distant points.  In this case, the origin is called 
a degenerate node. 
If p >  0, then the origin is a stable (degenerate) node, and if p <  0, it is a unstable (degenerate) 
node.

Star points.  Suppose p2  = 4q , and suppose a = d and b = c = 0. Then, (30.1) reduces to 
� 
� 
x  = ax, 
y  = ay . 

The solution is given as 

y(t) = c2e at , 
x(t) = c1e at ,
yielding  y/x  is  constant.  Hence,  the  orbits  are  radial  lines  throught  the  origin.  In  this  case  the 
origin is called a star point or a singular node. If p > 0 (a > 0), the origin is a stable star point and if 
p < 0, then it is unstable.

Vanishing determinant.  Next, we consider q = 0, that is, ad−bc = 0.  It then follows that cx�−ay �  = 0, 
and hence cx − ay is constant.  It gives a family of parallel lines, unless a = c = 0. Similarly, dx − by 
is constant, and it gives a family of parallel lines unless b = d = 0. 
Zero coefﬁcient.  Finally, if p = q = 0, then a = b = c = d = 0.  In this case, every solution of (30.1) is 
a critical point. This case is uninteresting.
