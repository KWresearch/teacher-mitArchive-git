UNIT I: FIRST-ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 

We  set  forth  fundamental principles  in  the  analysis of differential  equations.  We  illustrate  the 
use of integration to ﬁnd the solutions of ﬁrst-order linear differential equations and special classes 
of ﬁrst-order nonlinear differential equations, called separable equations.  Substitution techniques 
are used in studying linear fractional equations and special kind of second-order differential equa­
tions.

LECTURE  1.  INTEGRATION AND  SOLUTIONS

We recall the fundamental theorem of calculus 
x 
d 
f (s)ds = f (x),
(1.1) 
dx  x0 
if f  is continuous on an interval x0  ∈ I . A solution of the differential equation 
dy  = f (x)
� 
dx 
is  the  function  y  =  φ(x) which  satisﬁes  the  differential  equation  on  I .  Upon  inspection  of  (1.1), 
x 
then, y = 
f (s)ds is a solution of (1.2). This leads to an existence result. 
x0 
Theorem 1.1.  If f (x) is continuous on an internval xo  ∈ I  then given an arbitrary number y0  there exists 
� 
a unique solution of  (1.2) satisfying y(x0 ) = y0 . The solution is given as 
x 
y(x) = y0  + 
x0 

f (s)ds. 

Exercise. Prove the uniqueness. 
Remark.  1.  The  theorem  speciﬁes  the  interval  of  existence  (x0  ∈  I )  and  the  class  of  functions 
considered (the class of continuous functions).  It asserts the existence and uniqueness of a solution, 
prescribed the initial condition y(x0 ) = y0 . 
2.  In the statement of the theorem,  the interval of existence is I , regardless of the initial condi­
tion.  It  is a special property of  linear equations.  For nonlinear equations,  in general,  the  interval 
of existence depends on the initial value, e.g.  the solution of the initial value problem

y(0) = y0  = 0,

such that F � (x) = sin x2 , but the function S(x) deﬁned as a deﬁnite integral gives a perfectly good 
function.

The  preceding  discussion  leads  to  how  to  solve  differential  equations  of  the  form  (1.2)  by  in-
x 
f (s)ds.  Other  solutions are,  then,  obtained 
spection.  For any x0 ,  one  solution  is  the  function 
are  the  functions  y  =  �

ds  = (
others are obtained by the vertical translations (x, y)  �→ (x, y + C ) and they form a one-parameter 
family of curves, one for each value of the parameter C . 

Quadrature.  When the solution of a differential equation is expressed by a formula involving one 
or more integrations,  it is said that the equation is solvable by quadrature.  The term “quadrature” 
has  its historical origin  in  the  connection of  integration with area.  In plane geometry,  a problem 
of quadrature, such as quadrature of the circle is a problem about the area of a plane ﬁgure.  Not all 
differential equations can be solved by quadrature.  In the following lecture, we will show that the 
ﬁrst-order linear equation 

y �  + p(x)y = q(x) 
can be solved by quadrature. But, the second-order differential equation 
y ��  + p(x)y �  + q(x)y = r(x) 
cannot be solved, in general, by quadrature, except for some special cases. 

The next simples type of differential equation is 
dy  = g(y). 
(1.3) 
dx 
Such a differential equation is invariant under horizontal translations (x, y)  �→ (x + c, y). Geomet­
rically, it means that any horizontal line is cut by all solution curves at the same angle (such lines 
are called “isoclines”).  Therefore,  if y  =  φ(x) is a solution of (1.3), then so is y  =  φ(x + c) for any 
c. The differential equation (1.3) can be solved by writing it as dy/g(y) = dx and integrating. 

Example 1.2.  Consider 

dy  = y 2  − 1. 
(1.4) 
dx 
Since  y2  −  1 = (y  −  1)(y  +  1),  the  constant  functions  y  =  ±1  are  particular  solutions  of  (1.4). 
They  are  called  steady  states,  stationary  solutions  or  equilibria,  in  the  sense  that  these  solutions  are 
independent of x. 
Next, if  y < 1 then y2 − 1 < 0, and follows dy/dx < 0. That is, the solution curve is decreasing. 
| | 
On  the  other  hand,  if  |y |  >  1,  then  dy/dx  =  y − 1  >  0,  and  the  solution  curve  is  increasing.  It

gives us the qualitative behavior of solutions curves of (1.4).

Using  the  partial  fractions  and  separating  variables  (we  will  discuss  this  technique  in  detail 
later), (1.4) is written as

This procedure of  separating variables “loses”  the particular  solutions y  =  ±1,  but  it gives all 
other solutions. 
Note that if y = φ(x) is a solution of (1.4) then so is 1/y = 1/φ(x). 
Exercise. Discuss y �  = y3  − y .
