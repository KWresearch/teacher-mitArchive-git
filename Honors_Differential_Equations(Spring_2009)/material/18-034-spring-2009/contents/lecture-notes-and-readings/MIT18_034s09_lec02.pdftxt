LECTURE  2.  FUNDAMENTAL  PRINCIPLES 

Linearity.  A (differential) operator L is said linear if 
L(c1u + c2v) = c1Lu + c2Lv 
(2.1) 
for  all  scalars  c1 ,  c2  and  for  all  members  u,  v  in  the  domain  of  L.  For  example,  the  differential 
operator, deﬁned by Ly = y �  + p(x)y  is linear, where p(x) is deﬁned on an open interval I  and the 
domain of L consists of differentiable functions on I . 
The importance of linear operators lies in the following. 

Principle of Superposition.  If L is a linear operator, then Lu = f  and Lv = g  implies 
L(c1u + c2v) = c1f  + c2g . 

The proof is immediate and it is left as an exercise.  The principle of superposition has applica­
tion in the study of linear differential equations. 
Example 2.1.  Let 

Ly = y ��  + y . 
It  is  obvious  that L(sin x) = 0  and L(cos x) = 0.  Then,  the  principle  of  superposition  show  that 
y(x) = c1 sin x + c2 cos x satisﬁes Ly = 0 for any constants c1 , c2 . Thus, we obtain a two-parameter 
family of solutions of y ��  + y = 0. 
Example 2.2.  Let 

Ly = y �  − 2y . 

By inspection, 

L(1) = −2,
L(e 5x ) = 3e 5x ,
L(e 2x ) = 0. 
then, the principle of superposition show that y = −4 + 2e5x + ce2x  is a solution of y � − 2y = 8 + 6e5x 
for any constant c. 
Exercise.  (Principle of the Complementary Solution.) Let L be a linear operator.  If u is a particular 
solution of Ly = f  and if v  is a solution of Ly = 0, then show that y = u + v satisﬁes Ly = f . 

Existence and uniqueness.  When a problem from physics or engineering is formulated into a set 
of differential equations, demanded are that a solution should exist and that it should be unique. 
They are  the subjects of existence and uniqueness,  respectively.  The difference between  two  issues 
is:  an  existence  result  asserts  that  there  is  at  least  one  solution while  a  uniqueness  result  asserts 
that there is at most one solution. 
While  existence  theory  is  not  slighted  in  this  course,  many  differential  equations  are  easy  to 
solve on computers with approximate solutions accurate  to  (say) 3-5 decimal digits.  (For special 
classes of differential equations which one can solve explicitly, existence issue is settled then and 
there.) On the other hand, uniqueness is a theoretical issue and it can be studied only by means of 
analytical proofs. 
To put this in perspective, let us study a physical system described by 
y � (0) = 1. 
y ��  + y = 0,
y(0) = 0,

It  is  easily  seen  that  y(x)  =  sin x  is  a  solution;  the  issue  of  existence  is  settled.  This  particular 
solution  describes  an  oscillatory  behavior,  and  it  is  tempted  to  say  that  the  system  describes  an 
oscillatory motion. But, with the uniqueness issue in doubt, we cannot make such a conclusion. 
Uniqueness indeed fails. Let us consider 
y ��  + y = 0,
y(0) = 0 = y(π). 
Again,  y(x)  =  sin x  is  a  solution,  and  the  existence  is  a  trivial matter.  But,  y(x) =  A sin(kx)  is  a 
solution  for  any  A  ∈  R  and  k  ∈  Z.  There  are  inﬁnitely many  solutions,  therefore.  This  system 
consists  of  the  simple  second-order  linear  differential  equation,  same  as  one  in  above  and  two 
simple side conditions.  In  fact,  the system describes small oscillations of a plucked string, and  it 
is a perfectly good physical system. 
We give another example of failure of uniqueness. 
Example 2.3.  Let us consider the differential equation 
y �  = 3y 2/3 . 
(2.2) 
It  is  straightforward  that  y(x) = (x − c)3  is a  solution of  the differential  equation  for any  c.  But, 
⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩

there are other solutions.  Indeed, y(x) = 0 is also a solution of (2.2). Moreover, 
(x − a)3 
0 
(x − b)3 
is a solution of (2.2) for any a < b, sketched below.

Hence, (2.2) has a two-parameter family of solutions, depending on a and b. 
Failure of uniqueness  is not always a bad news.  A point where a presumably unique solution 
branches into multiple solutions is called bifurcation point.  At such points, the system experiences 
a sudden change in qualitative behavior. Bifurcation is a special kind of failure of uniqueness and 
it has signiﬁcance in applications.  e.g.  consider 
y �  = (a − c)y − by3 , 
b > 0.

(2.3) 
� 
Here, we  view  b  and  c  as ﬁxed  and  a  as  a  parameter.  If  a < c,  then  y  = 0  is  the  only  stationary

=
 0,  there  are  two more

solution of  the differential  equation.  But,  if a > c,  then  in addition  to  y 
stationary solutions y = ±  (a − c)/b.  In other words, at a = c there bifurcate nontrivial stationary 
solutions from a line of trivial stationary solution.  In this case, a = c is a bifurcation point. 
We now present a basic uniqueness theorem.

Theorem 2.4 (A Uniqueness Theorem).  If f (y) is a continuously differentiable and bounded in a rectan­
gular region R in the (x, y)-plane, and if, in addition, f �  is bounded in R, then for any point (x0 , y0 ) ∈ R, 
the differential equation 

has at most one solution satisfying y(x0 ) = y0 . 

y �  = f (y) 

The proof is presented later with more generality. 
Remark.  If f (y) = 3y2/3  then f � (y) = 2y−1/3  is unbounded on a region containing zero, and it does 
not violate the theorem. 

Exercise.  Show  that  the  solution  curves  of  (2.2)  and  y(0) =  0 ﬁll up  entirely  the  region between 
the curve y  =  x3  and the x-axis.  That is, for any point (x0 , y0 ) in this region, there is a solution of 
(2.2) satisfying y(x0 ) = y0 . 

Qualitative  behavior.  The  equation  dy/dx  =  f (y)  gives  the  slope  of  a  solution  y  =  φ(x)  at  any 
point  of  the  curve,  even  before  solving  the  equation,  and  it  gives  a  qualitative  behavior  of  the 
system. 
Let us consider the differential equation 

(2.4) 

dy  = (y − 1)(y − 2)(y − 4) ≡ f (y). 
dx 

The graph of f (y) is give below. 

Figure 2.3. Graph of f (y). 

It is readily seen that (2.4) has the stationary solutions y = 1, 2, 4.  At these stationary solutions, 
f (y) = 0 and hence dy/dx = 0. Therefore, the solution curves are horizontal. 
Now, we  study  the behavior of nonstationary  solutions of  (2.4)  in  terms of  the  sign of  f (y).  If 
y <  1,  then  f (y)  is  negative,  and  the  solutions  are  increasing  functions.  That  means,  solutions 
move  away  from  y  = 1.  Similarly,  if  1  < y <  2  then  f (y)  is  positive,  and  solutions move  away 
from y  = 1 and move towards y  = 2.  If 2 < y <  4 solutions move towards y  = 2 and move away 
from  y  = 4.  Finally,  if  4  < y  then  solutions move  away  from  y  = 4.  For  these  reasons,  we  say 
the stationary solution y  = 2 is stable and y  = 1, 4 are unstable.  The behavior of solution curves is 
sketched in the ﬁgure below.

Here,  we  rely  on  the  intuitive  deﬁnitions  of  stability/instability.  The  rigorous  deﬁnitions  of 
stability/instability will be given later. 
Let us consider a more complicated example 
dy  = (y + 1)3 y 4 (y − 2)7 (y − 3)5 (y − 5)8  ≡ g(y). 
dx 
The graph of g(y) and its sign are indicated in the ﬁgure below. 

Figure 2.5. Graph of g(y) and its change of sign. 
By the same argument that we used before we say the stationary solutions y = −1, 3 are unstable 
while y  = 2  is  stable.  We  say  the  stationary  solutions y  = 0, 5 are  semi-stable.  For,  on one  side of 
y  = 0 or y  = 5, the adjacent solutions move towards the stationary solution, but on the other side 
solutions move away from it.
