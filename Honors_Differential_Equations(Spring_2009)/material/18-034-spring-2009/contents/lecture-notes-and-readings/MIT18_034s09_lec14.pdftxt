LECTURE  14.  STABILITY 

The notion of stability.  Roughly speaking, a system is called stable if its long-term behavior does 
not depend on signiﬁcantly the initial conditions. 
An important result of mechanics is that a system of masses attached in (damped or undamped) 
springs  is  stable.  A  similar  result  is  in  network  theory.  In  these  notes,  we  study  the  differential 
equation of the form 
y ��  + py �  + qy = f (t), 
(14.1) 
where p, q are constatnts and f (t) represents the external forces. 
We learned that the general solution of (14.1) has the form 
y = c1y1  + c2y2  + yp , 
(14.2) 
where  c1 ,  c2  are  arbitrary  constants  and  yp  is  a  particular  solution  of  (14.1);  c1y1  +  c2y2  is  the 
complementary  solution,  that  is,  the  general  solutions  of  the  homogeneous  equation  (14.1) with 
f (t) = 0. 
The initial conditions determine the values of c1  and c2 . Thus, we say the system (14.1) is stable 
if c1y1  + c2y2  → 0 as t → ∞ for any coice of c1  and c2 . 
If  (14.1)  is  stable  then  yp  is  called  the  steady-state  solution  and  c1y1  +  c2y2  is  called  transient. 
Physically,  in  a  stable  system,  the  output  is  the  sum  of  a  transient  term,  which  depends  on  the 
initial  conditions,  but  whose  effects  die  out  over  time,  and  a  steady-state,  which  represents  the 
response of the system to the input f (t) after a long time. 
Stability conditions.  We study under what circumstances the differential equation Ly = f , where 
L = Dn  + p1Dn−1  + ......... + pn−1D + pn ,

(14.3) 
where pj  are constants, is stable. 
Deﬁnition 14.1.  The differential equation Ly = f , where L is given in (14.3) is called: 
(i)  asymptotically stable if every solution of Ly = 0 tends to zero as t → ∞; 
(ii)  stable if every solution of Ly = 0 remains bounded a t → ∞; 
(iii)  unstable if it is not stable. 
We note  that  stability  concerns only  the behavior of  the  solutions of  the  corresponding homo­
geneous equation Ly = 0. 
When f (t) = 0,  then a  steady-state  solution  is y  ≡  0.  In  this  case,  the  system  is  stable  if  small 
initial departures from the steady-state remain small with the lapse of time. 

By  deﬁnition,  Ly  =  f  is  asymptotically  stable  if  every  basis  solution  of  Ly  = 0  tends  to  zero 
as  t  → ∞  and  it  is  stable  if  the  basis  solutions  remain  bounded.  In  view  of  the  characteristic 
polynomial of L and the fundamental theorem of algebra, we write 
(D − λm )km ,
L = (D − λ1 )k1 (D − λ2 )k2 
· · · 
where λj  ∈ C are all distinct and k1  + k2  + ...... + km  = n. 

Exercise. The general solution of the homogeneous equation Ly = 0 is given by 
y(t) = c1 (t)e λ1 t  + c2 (t)e λ2 t ...... + cm (t)e λm t , 

1 

where cj (t) is an arbritary polynomial of degree kj  − 1. 
Exercise.  If r is a nonnegative integer and λ ∈ C, show that 
lim  |tr e λt | = 0 
if  Reλ < 0. 
t→∞ 

Therefore,  Ly  =  f  is  asymptotically  stable  if Reλj  <  0  for  all  j ,  and  it  is  stable  if Reλj  <  0  or 
Reλj  = 0 and kj  = 1. 
We summarize the result. 
Theorem 14.2.  The differential equation Ly = f  is asymptotically stable if every root of the characteristic 
polynomial of L has a negative real part, and  it is stable  if every multiple root has a negative real part and 
no simple root has a positive real part. 

Example 14.3.  We consider the second-order differential equation 
y ��  + py �  + qy = 0, 
(14.4) 
p, q are constants. 
We  recall  that  the discriminant Δ =  p2  − 4q  tells us about  the nature of  the  solutions,  and hence 
about the stability of (14.4) 
If q < 0 then Δ > 0 and the characteristic polynomial λ2 + pλ+ q has two real roots with opposite 
signs. Therefore, (14.4) is unstable. 
If  p <  0  then  at  least  one  root  of  the  characteristic  polynomial must  have  a  positive  real  part. 
Hence, (14.4) is unstable. 
If  p  = 0  and  q >  0,  then  (14.4)  reduces  to  y ��  +  qy  = 0  with  q >  0.  Hence,  it  is  stable  but 
asymptotically stable. 
Finally,  let  p >  0  and  q >  0.  If  Δ  �  0  then  the  roots  of  the  characteristic  polynomial  have 
negative real parts, and  (14.4)  is asymptotically stable.  If Δ  >  0  then Δ =  p2  − 4q < p2  and  thus 
√
Δ < p. Therefore, (14.4) is asymptotically stable. 

In summary, (14.4) is asymptotically stable if and only if p > 0 and q > 0, and stable if and only 
if p � 0 and q > 0. 
Stability  of higher-order  differential  equations.  The  above  example  phrases  the  stability  crite­
rion  for  (14.4)  in  terms  of  the  coefﬁcients  of  the  equation.  This  is  convenient  since  it  does  not 
require one to calculate the roots of the characteristic polynomial. 
For higher-order equations, 
· · · 
+ pn−1y �  + pny = 0,
y (n)  + p1y (n−1)  +
(14.5) 
pj  are constants, 
it  is  not  too  hard  to  show  that  if  (14.5)  is  asymptotically  stable  then  pj  >  0  for  all  j  (Exercise). 
But,  the converse  is not  true  (Exercise).  For  the  implication of a criterion  for coefﬁcients of  (14.5) 
for  stability,  the  coefﬁcients must  satisfy  a more  complicated  set  of  inequalities,  which  we  state 
without proof in the following.
