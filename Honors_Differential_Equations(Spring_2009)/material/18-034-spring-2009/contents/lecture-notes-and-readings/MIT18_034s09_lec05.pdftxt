Homogeneous equations.  A function f (x, y) is said homogeneous of degree m if 
f (λx, λy) = λmf (x, y), 
λ > 0.

If P  and Q are homogeneous of the same degree then P /Q is homogeneous of degree zero.  Indeed,

(5.2)	

These equations are called homogeneous.

Theorem 5.1.  Let y = φ(x) satisfy (5.1) on an interval I .

the function z = (1/c)φ(cx) satisﬁes z �  = f (z/x) on the corresponding interval. 
(i)  If c = 0 
and f (v) =�
v  then under the change of variables v = y/x, the equation (5.1) becomes 
(ii)	 If x = 0

The proof is left as an exercise. 
The equation (5.2) is separable, and its solution is given by x = k exp(  dv/(f (v) − v)).

We now use the result to study an important class of differential equations, called linear fractional 
equations

The equation (5.3’) is of the form (5.1) with f (v) = 
f (v) =�
v . Hence, the results in Theorem 5.1 apply. 
Upon the substitution v = y/x, the equation (5.3’) becomes

where v = y/x and k  is a constant. 

Invariant radii.  Alternatively, we can study a homogeneous equation (5.1) in polar coordinates 
x = r cos θ, 
y = r sin θ. 
Let γ be the angle that the tangent direction of a solution curve and let ψ = γ − θ . Then, 
cot γ cot θ + 1 
1 dr 
= cot ψ =

cot θ − cot γ

Since γ  = y �  = f (y/x) = f (tan θ), it follows that

By integrating, we obtain the solution of (5.1) as  �  θ 
r(θ) = r(0) exp  Q(θ)dθ .

θ , that is, as long as y �  =�
The function on the right side is well-deﬁned, as long as tan γ  = tan 
y/x. 
If  a  solution  curve  r(θ)  is  such  that  the  denominator  of  Q(θ)  vanishes  along  it  then  (5.1)  is 
equivalent to dθ/dr  = 0.  Hence,  these radii are particular solution curve of (5.1).  They are called 
invariant radii. They are the solutions y = (tan θ)x for which y �  = tan θ = f (tan θ). 
For the linear fractional equation (5.3’) the slopes of invariant radii are solutions of 
c + d tan θ 
. 
a + b tan θ 

:= Q(θ). 

tan θ = 

They are the roots of the quadratic equation 
b(tan θ)2  + (a − d)(tan θ) − c = 0. 
If  r  =  g(θ)  is  a  solution  of  (5.1),  then  so  is  r  =  λg(θ).  Indeed,  the  solution  curve  is  invariant 
under  the  similar  transformation  (x, y)  �→  (λx, λy).  To  interpret,  in  the  sector  between  any  two 
adjacent invariant radii are all “geometrically similar ”. This fact is useful in sketching the solution 
curves. 
We discuss another example of homogeneous equations. 
Example 5.2.  If xy =� x2  then the equation (xy − x2 )y �  = y2  can be written as 
(y/x)2 
y2

That  is,  the  equation  is of  the  form  (5.1) with  f (v) =

v − 1

solution v  = 0, which corresponds to y  = 0.  If xv  = 0

Some second-order equations.  Many second-order differential equations can be reduced to ﬁrst-
order equations by appropriate substitution. 
We ﬁrst consider a second-order equation of the form 
y ��  = f (x, y � ).

(5.4) 
That  is,  the differential equation does not  involve the dependent variable y  explicitly.  Let v  =  y � .

Since y ��  = (y � )�  = v �  = dv/dx, the equation (5.4) is reduced to the ﬁrst-order equation 
dv  = f (x, v). 
dx 

If this equation can be solved for v  then y can be obtained by integrating 

dy  = v . 
dx 

Exercises.  Solve the differential equation: 
1.  x2y ��  + 2xy �  − 1 = 0 
2.  y ��  + x(y � )2  = 0 

3.  x2y ��  = (y � )2 ,  x > 0. 

Next, we consider a second-order equation of the form 
y ��  = g(y , y � ). 
(5.5) 
That is, the differential equation does not involve the independent variable x explicitly. 
Let v  =  y � , and we express (5.5) as a ﬁrst-order differential equation with y  as the independent 
variable. By the chain rule, 

y ��  = 

dv
v . 
dy 

dv  = 
dx 

dv dy  = 
dy dx 

Using this in (5.5) we obtain 

dv 
v  = g(y , v). 
dy 
Provided  that  this ﬁrst-order equation can be solved, we obtain v  as a  function of y .  Then,  y  can 
dy  = v(y). 
be obtained by solving 
dx 
The  expression  vdv/dy  is  more  subtle  than  dv/dx,  since  y  is  thought  of  as  a  function  of  x  in 
the differential equation and is treated as as independent variable in the chain rule.  We include a 
mathematical  justiﬁcation,  for  completeness∗.  The  idea  is  that  if  f  is differentiable  function  then 
df (u) has the same form no matter what u is an independent variable or is a differentiable function 
φ(x) of another variable x. Namely, 
df (φ(x)) = f � (φ(x))φ� (x)dx = f � (u)du. 
Let y = φ(x) satisﬁes (5.5). Then, 
φ�� (x) = g(φ(x), φ� (x)). 
(5.6) 
With v = φ� (x) and dv = φ�� (x)dx, the equation in differentiable form vdv = g(y , v)dy becomes 
φ� (x)φ�� (x)dx = g(φ(x), φ� (x))φ� (x)dx, 
(5.7) 
which  is  different  from  (5.6)  by  the  factor  of  φ� (x)dx.  Therefore,  (5.5)  is  equivalent  to  vdv  = 
g(y , v)dy ,  provided  that  φ� (x) =�
0.  (If  the  zeros  of  φ� (x)  are  isolated,  and  (5.6)  is  equivalent  to 
(5.7) except these isolated zeros.  In this case, by continuity, (5.6) holds everywhere.) 

Exercises.Solve the differential equation: 
1.  yy ��  + (y � )2  = 0  2.  y ��  + y(y � )3  = 0 
3.  2y2y ��  + 2y(y � )2  = 1. 

∗It requires rudimentary knowledge on differentiable forms.
