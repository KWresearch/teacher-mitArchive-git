UNIT III: HIGHER-ORDER LINEAR EQUATIONS 

We give a comprehensive development of  the  theory of  linear differential equations with con­
stant  coefﬁcients.  We  use  the  operator  calculus  to  deduce  the  existence  and  uniqueness.  We 
presents  techniques  for  ﬁnding  a  complete  solution  of  the  inhomogeneous  equation  from  solu­
tions of the homogeneous equation. We also give qualitative results on asymptotic stability. 

LECTURE  11.  HIGHER-ORDER  LINEAR  EQUATIONS 

The n-th order linear differential equation with constant coefﬁcient is 
· · · 
Ly = y (n)  + p1y (n−1)  +
+ pn−1y �  + pny = f (t),

(11.1) 

dk y 
where y (k)  = 
is the k-th derivative of y with respect to t, and pj  are real or complex constants, 
dtk 
f (t) is a continuous function on an interval I . The letter L stands for the (homogeneous) differen­
→
tial operator.  It is easy to see that L : C n (I )  C (I ) is linear, where C k (I ) is the space of functions 
differentiable k times on I . 
As for the second-order equations treated in Unit II, the principle of superposition and the principle 
of the complementary solution apply to (11.1). 

Principle of Superposition.  If Lu = 0 and Lv = 0, where L is given in (11.1), then L(c1u + c2v) = 0 
for any constants c1  and c2 . 

Principle  of  the  Complementary  Solution.  If  u  is  a  particular  solution  of  Lu  =  f ,  where  L  is 
given in (11.1), and if v  is any solution of Lv = 0, then L(u + v) = f  and every solution of Ly = f 
can be obtained this way. 

Therefore, the general solution of (11.1) is given as 
y = yp  + yh , 
where yp  is a particular solution of (11.1) and yh  is a solution of the corresponding homogeneous 
equation 

· · · 
+ pn−1y �  + pny = 0.
Ly = y (n)  + p1y (n−1)  +
(11.2) 
The characteristic polynomial.  We try y(t) = eλt , λ ∈ C, as a solution of the homogeneous equa­
dk 
(e λt ) = λk eλt , the substitution yields 
tion (11.2).  Since 
dtk 
· · · 
Leλt  = (λn  + p1λn−1  +
+ pn−1λ + pn )e λt  = 0.
Moreover, since eλt  is never zero, Leλt  = 0 if and only if λ is a root of the characteristic polynomial 
pL (λ) = λn  + p1λn−1  + ........... + pn−1λ + pn .

Example 11.1.  We recall the results for the second-order equation 
Ly = y ��  + py �  + qy , 
(11.4) 
where p , q are constants. The roots of the characteristic polynomial are 
−p ± √
Δ 
Δ = p 2  − 4q . 
,

If p2  > 4q  then y = eλt  with the above λ are solutions of Ly = 0. 
We will show how the exponential substitution y  =  eλt  applies to solve the general differential 
equations of all order (11.2). 

λ = 

The  operator  calculus.  The  study  of  linear  differential  equations  become  easier  if we  introduce 
an abstract symbol D  =  d/dt for the operation of differentiation.  A word of caution.  The symbol 
d is used for differentials.  e.g., D(t3 ) = 3t2 , but d(t3 ) = 3t2dt. 
As an operator, D is linear. That is, 
D(u + v) = Du + Dv , 
D(cu) = cDu 
for all differentiable functions u, v and for any constant c. 
We now list some properties of D . By deﬁnition, 
dk 
dtk 

k = 1, 2, . . . . 

D0  = id, 

Dk  = 

(Dj )k  = Dj k , 

j, k = 1, 2, . . . . 

Moreover, 
Dj Dk  = Dj+k , 
(11.5) 
The proof is left as an exercise. 
With the notation D , we may write the differential operator in (11.2) as 
· · · 
Ly = (Dn  + p1Dn−1  +
+ pn−1D + pn )y . 
Then, it can be recognized that the ﬁrst factor of the right side is pL (D), the characteristic polyno­
mial pL  evaluated, formally, at D .  In this sense, we say L = pL (D).

Linear operators with constant coefﬁcients are permutable, in the sense of the following.

Lemma 11.2.  If p(D) = 
aj Dj  and q(D) = 
bkDk  are two linear differential operator, where aj  , bk 
are constants.  then, 
aj bkDj+k . 
p(D)q(D) = q(D)p(D) = 

The proof uses (11.5) and it is left as an exercise. 
Remark 11.3.  The above lemma is not true of linear operators with variable coefﬁcients.  For exam­
ple, 
D(tf ) = (tf )�  = tf �  + f  = (tD + id)f , 
where f  is a differentiable function of t.  In other words, Dt = tD + id. 
In many applications, one takes trial solutions of the form eλ tu where λ ∈ C and u is a function 
with a certain degree of smoothness.  Thus,  it  is useful  to know how such a  function works with 
the operator D . 
Lemma 11.4 (The Exponential Shift Laws).  If p is a polynomial and λ is a constant, then 
p(D)(e λtf ) = e λt p(D + λ)f .

Proof.  By the rule for differentiation, 

D(e λtf ) = e λtDf  + λeλt  = e λt (D + λ)f . 

Hence, 

(11.6) 

(D − a)(e λtf ) = e λt (D − a + λ)f 
for any constant a. Then, by induction, 
(D − a)k (e λtf ) = e λt (D − a + λ)k f . 
Finally, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, any polynomial p can be factorized as

p(D) = (D − a1 )k1 (D − a2 )k2 
· · · 
(D − am )km ,

where  aj  ∈  C  are  roots  of  the  polynomial  and  kj  �  1  are  the  corresponding  multiplicity.  The 
� 
assertion then follows by Lemma 11.2 and (11.6). 

As a consequence, moreover, we have 
(D − λ)(e λtf ) = e λtDf , 

(D − λ)k (e λtf ) = e λtDk f . 

Exercise.  If a is not a root of the polynomial p , then show that 

ate
p(a) 
is a particular solution of the differential equation p(D)y = eat . 

b(t) = 

We now present our main result. 
Theorem  11.5.  If  λ is  a  (complex)  root  of multiplicity  k  of  the  characteristic  polynomial  p(λ) =  λn  +

p1λn−1  +
+ pn−1λ + pn  of  the  linear  differential  operator  p(D)  with  constant  coefﬁcients,  then  the 
functions tr eλ∗ t , where r = 0, 1, . . . , k − 1, are solution of p(D)y = 0. 
Proof.  By the exponential shift law, it follows that 
(D − λ )k (t e λ∗ t ) = e λ∗ tDk t = 0

On the other hand, p(λ) must contain the factor (λ − λ )k , and hence

p(D) = (D − λ )k q(D),

Finally, by Lemma 11.2 

This completes the proof. 

p(D)(tr e λ∗ t ) = q(D)(D − λ )k (tr e λ∗ t ) = 0.

p(λ) = (λ − λ1 )k1 (λ − λ2 )k2  (λ − λm )km

then the functions tr eλj t  , where r = 0, 1, 2, . . . , λj−1  and j  = 1, 2, . . . , m, are solutions of the differential 
equation p(D)y = 0.

Complex solutions.  An  interesting  feature of  the analysis via  the operator calculus  is  that many 
problems are best solved by  the use of complex-valued  functions, even when  the coefﬁcients are 
real, e.g.  (11.4) when p2  < 4q . 
Theorem  11.5  holds whether  the  coefﬁcients  pj  of  p(D)y  = 0  are  real  or  complex.  In  fact,  al­
though  t  is  interpreted  as  real  (in  particular  in  the  discussion  of  stability)  the  operator  calculus 
and the solutions constructed with it apply equally well to functions of the complex variable. But, 
when the coefﬁcients pj  are real, then we may obtain a stronger conclusion. 
We recall  that  the complex roots of a polynomial come  in pair, µ ± iν , µ, ν  ∈  R.  We also recall 
the complex exponential eµ±iν  = eµ (cos ν ± iν ). 
Lemma 11.7 (Principle of Equating Real Parts).  If a complex-valued function y(t) = u(t) + iv(t), where 
u  and  v  are  real-valued  functions,  satisﬁes  the differential  equation  (11.2) with  real  coefﬁcients,  then u(t) 
and v(t), the real and imaginary parts of y , both satisfy (11.2). 
Proof.  Let Ly  =  L(u + iv) = 0.  Since  the  coefﬁcients of L are  real,  taking  the  complex  conjugate 
we have Ly = L(u − iv) = 0. Then, by linearity, 
y − y 
y + y 
and  v = 
u = 
2i

both satisfy (11.2). 
It holds true for differential equations with real-variable coefﬁcients. 
Corollary 11.8.  Each pair of  complex  roots µ ± iν , µ, ν  ∈  R,  of multiplicity k  of  the polynomial p gives 
real solutions tr eut cos ν t , tr eut sin ν t, where r = 0, 1, . . . , k − 1, of the differential equation p(D)y = 0.
