UNIT II: SECOND-ORDER LINEAR EQUATIONS 

We  discuss  the  existence  and  uniqueness  for  second-order  linear  differential  equations  with 
constant  coefﬁcients  by means  of  general  principles which  are  valid  for  equations with  variable 
coefﬁcients.  We  develop  techniques  of  the Wronskian  and  apply  to  study  the  oscillatory  behav­
ior.  We  also  give  qualitative  results  which  depend  on  conditions  at  an  interior  maximum  and 
minimum and apply to second-order equations. 

LECTURE  6.  SECOND-ORDER  LINEAR  EQUATIONS 

p0 (t)y ��  + p1 (t)y �  + p2 (t)y = f (t), 

The most intensively studied ordinary differential equations are second-order linear equations 
of the form 
(6.1)	
where �  = 
d
is differentiation in the t-variable, and pj (t), f (t), j  = 0, 1, 2, are continuous functions 
dt 
on an interval I . 
Remark 6.1  (Remark on  singular points).  If p0 (t) vanishes at  some point,  say  t0 ,  then we  say  that 
(6.1) has a singular point at t0 .  For example, the Legendre equation 
(1 − t2 )y ��  − 2ty �  + λy = 0 
((1 − t2 )y � )�  + λy = 0  or 
has  singular  points  at  t  =  ±1.  While  the  equation  admits  polynomial  solutions,  called  the  Le­
gendre  polynomials,  for  λ  =  n(n + 1),  other  nontrivial  solutions  develop  a  singularity  at  either 
t = 1 or t = −1. 
We do not treat singular points in this course. 
Bases of solutions.  If p0 (t) = 0 
on I  then (6.1) reduces to the normal form 
y ��  + p(t)y �  + q(t)y = f (t), 
(6.2)	
where p(t), q(t) and f (t) are continuous on I . 
We consider the corresponding homogeneous equation 
y ��  + p(t)y �  + q(t)y = 0.

(6.3) 
Since the equation is linear, the principle of superposition applies, and if φ and ψ  are solutions of

(6.3) then so is their linear combination c1φ + c2ψ  for any constants c1 , c2 . 
Deﬁnition  6.2.  On  a  given  interval  two  functions  are  said  linearly  dependent  if  one  of  them  is  a 
constant multiple of the other. They are said linearly independent, otherwise. 
For example, e−t  and e−2t  are  linearly  independent on every  interval of t, although they agree 
at t = 0. 
If φ and ψ are solutions of (6.3) and, in addition, if φ and ψ are linearly independent then every 
solution of (6.3) is of the form c1φ + c2ψ  for some constants c1 , c2 . We call such a pair of solutions 
{φ, ψ} a basis of  solutions of  (6.3).  The existence of a basis of  solutions  is a  fundamental  result  for 
(6.3)  and  for  a  broader  class  of  linear  homogeneous  differential  equations,  and we will  prove  it 
later.

Constant-coefﬁcient  differential  equations.  We  construct  a  basis  of  solution  of  a  second-order 
constant-coefﬁcient differential equation 
(6.4) 
where p, q are constants. 
The trick is to set y(t) = eλt , where λ ∈ C. We use (eλt )�  = λeλt  and (eλt )��  = λ2eλt  to write (6.4) 
as 

y ��  + py �  + qy = 0, 

e λt (λ2  + pλ + q) = 0. 
Since eλt  = 0
, it follows that y(t) = eλt  is a solution of (6.4) if and only if λ is a root of the quadratic 
polynomial

We divide our discussion according to the nature of the roots, which is determined by the sign of 
the discriminant Δ. 
If Δ > 0 then both roots are real, and

are  two solutions of  (6.4).  Moreover,  they are  linearly  independent.  Therefore,  they  form a basis 
of solutions of (6.4). 
If Δ = 0 then the method yields only the single solution e−pt/2 . Using the method suggested by 
Lagrange, we try ve−pt/2  as a second solution, where v = v(t). Upon substitution, (6.4) becomes 
(ve−pt/2 )��  + p(ve−pt/2 )�  + qve−pt/2  = v ��e−pt/2  = 0. 
Thus, v ��  = 0 must hold and we obtain the family of solutions y(t) = (c1  + c2 t)e−pt/2 .  Since 
e−pt/2 , 
te−pt/2 
are linearly independent, they form a basis of solutions of (6.4). 
If Δ < 0, then both roots are complex, and

are  two  real  solutions  of  (6.4).  Since  they  are  linearly  independent,  they  form  a  basis  of  (real) 
solutions of (6.4). 
The principle of equating real parts holds for, more generally, variable-coefﬁcient equations, and if 
z (t) = x(t) + iy(t) is a complex solution of 
z ��  + p(t)z �  + q(t)z = 0, 
where p(t) and q(t) are real-valued functions then so are x and y .

Inhomogeneous  equations  and  initial  value  problems.  Next,  we  turn  to  the  inhomogeneous 
equation  (6.2) with a general f (t).  The  following  result enables us  to get a  family of  solutions of 
(6.2) from a particular solution. 

Principle of the Complementary Solution.  If yp  is a solution of the inhomogeneous equation (6.2), 
called a particular  solution and  if φ and ψ  form a basis of  solutions of  the homogeneous  equation 
(6.3),  then  the  general  solution  of  (6.2)  is  given  by  yp  + c1φ + c2ψ ,  where  c1  and  c2  are  arbitrary 
constants. 
Proof.  Let y be a solution of (6.2).  Since y − yp  satisﬁes the homogeneous equation (6.3), it should 
� 
take the form c1φ + c2ψ  for some constants c1 , c2 . 
Example 6.3.  Let us consider 
y ��  + y = 3 sin 2t. 
(6.6) 
We try yp (t) = A sin 2t, where A is a constant, for a particular solution.  Since y ��  = −4A sin 2t, the 
differential equation becomes 
(−4A + A) sin 2t = 3 sin 2t. 
Thus, A  =  −1,  and  yp (t) =  − sin 2t  is  a particular  solution of  (6.6).  On  the other hand,  cos t  and 
sin t form a basis of solutions of the corresponding homogeneous equation y ��  + y  = 0.  Therefore, 
the general solution of (6.6) is given 
y(t) = − sin 2t + c1 cos t + c2 sin t. 
Particular solutions with polynomial forcing terms are treated similarly.  As an illustration, we 
consider 
y ��  + py �  + qy = ct + d, 
where p, q , c, d are constants. We ﬁrst look for a particular solution of the form yp (t) = at + b. Upon 
substitution, we obtain the equations 
qa = c, 
Unless q = 0, these give the particular solution 
qd − pc

yp (t) =

, then we look for a particular solution as a quadratic polynomial; y �� + y �  = x has 
If q = 0 but p = 0
a solution yp (t) =  t2/2 − t.  Finally, when p =  q  = 0, the equation y ��  =  ct + d has a cubic solution 
yp (t) = ct3/b + dt2/2. 
Other methods to construct a particular solution, such as variation of parameters and the anni­
hilator method, will be discussed later for a more general class of differential equations. 

pa + qb = 0. 

The equation (6.2) is sometimes supplemented with additional initial or boundary conditions. 
Example 6.4.  We illustrate how to solve initial value problem for differential equations in the form 
(6.2) by considering (6.6) with the initial conditions 
y(0) = y � (0) = 0. 
We have shown that the general solution of (6.6) is given as 
y(t) = − sin 2t + c1 cos t + c2 sin t, 
where  c1  and  c2  are  constants.  Such a  function will  satisfy y(0)  =  0  if and only  if  c1  = 0,  so  that 
y � (t) = −2 cos 2t + c2 cos t.  In particular, y � (0) = −2 + c2 .  Hence the function y(t) =  sin 2t − 2 sin t 
solves the stated initial value problem.

Historical introduction to linear differential equations.  The history of differential equations be­
gan in the 17th century when Newton, Leibniz, and the Bernoullis solved some simple differential 
equations  of  ﬁrst- and  second-order  arising  from  problems  in  geometry  and  mechanics.  These 
early discoveries  seemed  to  suggest  that  the  solutions  of  all differential  equations  based  on  geo­
metric and physical problems could be expressed in terms of the familiar elementary functions of 
calculus.  Therefore, much of the early work was devoted to developing ingenious techniques for 
solving differential equations by addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, composition, and 
integration, applied only ﬁnitely many times to the familiar functions of calculus. 
But,  it  soon  became  apparent  that  relatively  few  differential  equations  could  be  solved  by  el­
ementary  means.  Little  by  little,  mathematicians  began  to  realize  that  it  was  hopeless  to  try  to 
discover  methods  for  solving  all  differential  equations.  Instead,  they  found  it  more  fruitful  to 
ask whether  or  not  a  given  differential  equation  has  any  solution  at  all  and,  when  it  has,  to  try 
to deduce properties of  the solution  from  the differential equation  itself.  Within  this  framework, 
mathematicians began to think of differential equations as new sources of functions. 
In  the  1820’s,  Cauchy  obtained  the  ﬁrst  “existence  theorem”  for  differential  equations.  He 
proved  that every ﬁrst-order equation of  the  form y �  =  f (x, y) has a solution whenever  the right 
member,  f (x, y),  satisﬁes  certain general  conditions.  One  important  example  is  the Ricatti equa­
tion 
y �  = p(x)y 2  + q(x)y + r(x), 
where  p, q  and  r  are  given  functions.  Cauchy’s  work  implies  the  existence  of  a  solution  of  the 
Ricatti  equation  in  any  open  interval  (−a, a)  about  the  origin,  provided  p, q  and  r  have  power-
series  expansions  in  (−a, a).  In  1841  Joseph  Liouville  showed  that  in  some  cases  this  solution 
cannot be obtained by elementary means. 
Experiences  has  shown  that  it  is  difﬁcult  to  obtain  results  of much  generality  about  solutions 
of differential equations,  except  for a  few  types.  Among  these are  the so-called  linear differential 
equations, which occur in a great variety of scientiﬁc problems.  We develop the principal results 
concerning these equations.
