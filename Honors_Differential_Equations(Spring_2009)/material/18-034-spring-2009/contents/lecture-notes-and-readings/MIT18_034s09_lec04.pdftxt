LECTURE  4.  SEPARABLE  EQUATIONS 

Separable equations.  Separable equations are differential equations of the form 
f (x)
dy 
= 
(4.1) 
. 
g(y) 
dx 
For  example,  x +  yy �  = 0  and  y �  =  y2  −  1.  A  separable  equation  (4.1)  can  be  written  in  the 
differential form as 
f (x)dx = g(y)dy . 
(4.2) 
Then, it can be solved formally by integrating both sides of (4.2). 
We state and prove the rigorous theory of local solutions for (4.2) (and hence (4.1)). 
Theorem 4.1.  Let f (x) and g(x) be  continuous  in  the  rectangle R  =  {(x, y) :  a < x < b, c < y  < d}. 
� 
� 
In  addition,  if  f  and  g  do  not  vanish  simultaneously  at  any  point  of  R,  then  (4.2)  has  one  and  only  one 
solution through each point (x0 , y0 ) ∈ R. The solution is given by 
y 
x
f (x)dx = 
g(y)dy 
(4.3) 
y0 
x0 
It  is  essential  that  f  and  g  do  not  vanish  simultaneously.  For  example,  xdx  =  −ydy  has  no 
solution through the origin. 
Proof.  Note that f (x) =�
0 for a < x < b or g(y) = 0 
�
assume g(y) > 0 for c < y < d. 
Let

for c < y < d.  Without  loss of generality, we

so that (4.3) becomes 
F (x) = G(x). 
(4.4) 
Since G� (y) = g(y) > 0 in R, by the inverse function theorem, G−1  exists and (4.4) can be written 
as y = G−1 (F (x)). That means,  dy  exists. Then, by differentiating (4.4), we get 
dx 
F � (x) = G� (x)

,  or  f (x) = g(y) 
.

This implies (4.2). Moreover, (4.3) gives the initial condition that y = y0  when x = x0 . 
To prove the uniqueness, let y  be one solution of (4.2) and z  be another solution with the same 
initial condition. Under the hypothesis, the equation 
f (x) 
dz  = 
g(z ) 
dx 
implies that dz/dx exists for any (x, z ) ∈ R. Let 
u = G(y),

v = G(z ). 

Then,

other hand, the initial conditions for u and v  at x0  agree.  Therefore, u =  v  everywhere in R.  This

completes the proof. 
Example 4.2.  Consider the initial value problem 
dy  = 1 + y 2 ,
dx 
Separating the variables, we write the differential equation as 
dy  = dx.
1 + y2 
Since the constant function never vanishes, upon integration and evaluation, we obtain 
tan−1 y = x + c, 
tan−1 1 = c.

Therefore,  the  (unique)  solution  of  (4.5)  is  y  =  tan(x +  π/4).  The  same  result  is  obtained  by 
integrating between corresponding limits

Orthogonal  trajectories.  If  two  families  of  curves  are  such  that  every  curve  of  one  family  inter­
sects the curves of the other family at a right angle, then we say that the two families are orthogonal 
trajectories of each other.  For example, the coordinate lines: 
x = c1 ,
y = c2 
in  a  Cartesian  coordinate  system  form  a  set  of  orthogonal  trajectories.  Another  example  is  the 
circles and radial lines 

r = c1 ,

θ = c2 

in a polar coordinate system. 
Suppose a curve in the (x, y)-plane is such that the tangent at a point (x, y) on it makes an angle 
φ with  the  x-axis.  The  orthogonal  trajectory  through  the  same  point  (x, y)  then makes  an  angle 
φ + π/2 with the x-axis.  Since 

tan(φ + π/2) = − cot φ = −

equation for the original family to get the differential equation for the orthogonal trajectories. 
Example 4.3.  We consider the family of circles 
x 2  + y 2  = cx 
(4.6) 
tangent to the y axis. 
By differentiating (4.6) and by eliminating c, we obtain a differential equation

these restrictions. 
The quantity c deﬁned by x2  + y2  =  cx is constant on the original curves of the family, but not 
on the orthogonal trajectories. That is why c must be eliminated in the ﬁrst step.

factor. We will study exact differential equation more systematically later.
