LECTURE  8.  UNIQUENESS AND  THE WRONSKIAN. 

Differential  inequality  and  uniqueness.  We  prove  the  uniqueness  theorem  for  linear  second-
order differential equations with variable coefﬁcients. 

Theorem 8.1 (Uniqueness Theorem).  If p(t) and q(t) are continuous on an open  interval I  containing 
t0 , then at most one solution of 

y ��  + p(t)y �  + q(t)y = f (t)

(8.1) 
on I  satisﬁes the initial conditions y(t0 ) = y0  and y � (t0 ) = y1 .

Proof.  Let y1  and y2  be any two solutions of (8.1) which satisfy the initial conditions. Let v = y1−y2 .

Then, 

v ��  + p(t)v �  + q(t)v = 0  on I  and  v(t0 ) = v � (t0 ) = 0. 
(8.2) 
We shall show that v(t) = 0 for all t ∈ I . 
We consider the function E (t) = v2  + (v � (t))2 . It is readily seen that E (t) � 0 and E (t0 ) = 0.  By 
differentiating, we obtain 
E � (t) =2v(t)v � (t) + 2v � (t)v �� (t) = 2v � (t)(v(t) + v �� (t)) 
=2v � (t)(v(t) − p(t)v � (t) − q(t)v(t)) 
= − 2p(t)(v � (t))2  + 2(1 − q(t))v(t)v � (t). 

The second equality uses (8.2). By the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, then 
(1 − q(t))v(t)v � (t) � (1 + |q(t)|)(v 2 (t) + (v � (t))2 ), 

whence 

E � (t) � (1 + |q(t)|)v 2 (t) + (1 + |q(t)| + 2|p(t)|)(v � (t))2  � KE (t), 
where K  � 1 + max ( q(t)| + 2|p(t) ) is a constant.

t∈I 
We claim that E (t) = 0 for all t  ∈  I .  Suppose, on the contrary,  that E (t1 )  >  0 at some point t1 . 
Assume t1  > t0 . The other case can be treated similarly. We compute 
d  (e−K tE (t)) = e−K t (E � (t) − KE (t)) � 0. 
dt
Hence, e−K tE (t) is a decreasing function of t.  In particular, 
e−K t1 E (t1 ) � e−K t0 E (t0 ) = 0. 
However, E (t1 ) � 0, which leads to a contradiction. This completes the proof. 

� 

The  above  method  applies  to  a  broad  class  of  linear  and  nonlinear  differential  equations.  It 
applies when y  is a complex solution and when p(t) and q(t) are merely bounded.

The Wronskian.

The Wronskian∗  of two differentiable functions u and v  is, by deﬁnition,

We write W (t) or W (u, v) to emphasize dependence on t or on the functions. 
In the study of a linear differential equation 
y ��  + p(t)y �  + q(t)y = 0,

(8.4) 
where p, q are continuous, the Wronskian can be computed easily by the following result.

Theorem 8.2.  (Abel’s identity†) Let u and v  be solutions of  (8.4), then the Wronskian W (u, v ; t) satisﬁes 
the ﬁrst-order differential equation 
W �  + p(t)W  = 0.

(8.5)

Consequently,

W (u, v ; t) = W (u, v , t0 ) exp  − 
p(s)ds 
. 
t0 
Proof.  By differentiating W � (u, v) = uv ��  − u��v .  The assertion follows upon substituting u��  and v �� 
� 
by (8.4) and by cancellation. 
Corollary 8.3.  The Wronskian  of  two  solutions of  (8.4)  is  either  identically positive,  identically negative 
or identically zero.

The Wronskian and linear dependence.  A collection of functions u1 ,

· · · 
c1u1 (t) +  + cnun (t) = 0 on t ∈ I 
· · · 
= cn  = 0.
implies  c1  = c2  =
It is called linearly dependent otherwise.  If u and v are linearly dependent, then u and v are propor­
tional. 
The Wronskian gives a simple criterion for linear dependence. 
Lemma 8.4.  Let u and v be differentiable functions on an interval I . 
(i)  If u and v are linearly dependent, then W (u, v ; t) = 0 for all t ∈ I . 
(ii)  If W (u, v ; t) = 0 on I  and v = 0
, then u and v are linearly dependent. 
The condition W (u, v) = 0 on an  interval,  in general, does not ensure  that u and v  are  linearly 
dependent.  For  example,  W (t3 , |t|3 )  ≡  0  but  t3  and  |t|3  are  linearly  independent  on  any  open 
interval containing zero. 
If u and v are solutions of a linear second-order differential equation, then a stronger result than 
(ii) in the above lemma holds true. 
Theorem 8.5.  Let u and v be solutions of  (8.4), where p, q are continuous functions on an interval I . 
If W (u, v ; t0 ) = 0 at some point t0  ∈  I ,  then u and v  are linearly dependent and hence W (u, v ; t) = 0 
for all t ∈ I .  If u and v are linearly independent then W (u, v ; t) = 0 at no point of I . 
Proof.  If W (u, v ; t0 ) = 0  then  two  vectors  (u(t0 ), u� (t0 )  and  (v(t0 ), v � (t0 ))  are  linearly  dependent. 
Hence, one can choose c1  and c2 , both cannot be zero, such that 
c1u(t0 )+c2v(t0 ) = 0, 
c1u� (t0 )+c2v � (t0 ) = 0.

We  consider  the  function  y(t) =  c1u(t) +  c2v(t).  Since  y  is  a  linear  combination  of  u  and  v , 
it  solves  (8.4).  Moreover,  it  satisﬁes  the  initial  condition  y(t0 ) =  y � (t0 ) = 0.  By  the  uniqueness 
theorem, then, y(t) = 0 for all t ∈  I .  That means, u and v  are proportional on I , and it proves the 
� 
ﬁrst assertion. The second assertion then is an obvious consequence of the ﬁrst. 
The  fact  that  (8.4) has no  singular points  is vital  in  the above  theorem.  For  example,  t2  and  t3 
are linearly independent solutions of the differential equation 
t2 y ��  − 4ty �  + 6y = 0.

c = 0

But, W (t2 , t3 ) = t4  vanishes at t = 0. 
The Wronskian  has  an  interesting  application  of  ﬁnding  a  basis  of  solutions  and  a  particular 
solution of a linear second-order differential equation. 
Theorem 8.6.  Let u be a non-vanishing solution of the differential equation (8.4). 
� 
(i)  The second solution v of  (8.4), independent of u, is given by 
e−P (t) 
� 
v(t) = cu(t) 
,
u2 (t) 
where P (t) =  p(t)dt. 
(ii)  a particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation 
y ��  + p(t)y �  + q(t)y = f (t) 
� 

is given by w = uz , where 
(e P u 2 z � )�  = ue P f , 
�  �
uv �  − u�v  = 
W (u, v) 
v 
=

The assertion then follows upon integration and the use of the Abel’s identity. 
(ii) Substituting w = uz  into the equation, we obtain 
uz ��  + (2u�  + pu)z �  = f . 
This is a ﬁrst-order linear differential equation for z � .  It is straightforward to compute the integrat­
ing factor ueP . Multiplying the above equation by the factor, 
z ��u 2 e P  + e P (2uu�  + pu 2 )z �  = ue P f . 

Proof.  (i) We compute 

P (t) = 

p(t)dt. 

� 

This proves the assertion. 
Example 8.7.  The trial solution y = tm  shows that the equation 
t2 y ��  − 13ty �  + 49y = 0, 
t > 0 
(8.7) 
has a solution u = t7 . To ﬁnd a second solution, linearly independent of u, we compute 
−13 
P (t) = −13 log t, 
e−P (t)

t 

The above theorem then gives 

p(t) =

= t
. 

v = t7 

t13 t−14dt = t7  log t.

The general solution to (8.7) is therefore 

where c1 , c2  are arbitrary constants.
