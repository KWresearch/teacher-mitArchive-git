LECTURE  10.  MAXIMUM  PRINCIPLE 

By considering the points where a function attains a maximum or minimum one can get a good 
deal of information about the solutions of a differential equation without solving it. 
We  begin with  a  review  of  terminology.  A  point  x  is  interior  to  an  interval  I  if  x  is  in  I  but  is 
not an endpoint.  An interval is bounded if its length is ﬁnite and closed if it contains its endpoints. 
For example, 1 < x �  2 is bounded but not closed and 1 � x �  2 is bounded and closed, x >  1 is 
neither bounded nor closed. 
A  real-valued  function  f (x)  deﬁned  on  the  interval  I  of  x  is  said  to  have  a  maximum  at  x0  if 
x0  ∈  I  and f (x0 )  �  f (x) on x  ∈  I .  The maximum  is  called  interior  if x0  is an  interior point of  I 
and it is called positive if f (x0 ) > 0. The “negative interior minimum” is deﬁned similarly. 
If the inequality f (x0 ) �  f (x) is required to hold only in some open interval J  ⊂  I , with x ∈  J 
and x0  ∈ J  then the maximum is said to be local.  In what follows, we use the terms maximum and 
minimum to mean local maximum and local minimum, respectively. 
We recall the following theorem of calculus. 
Theorem 10.1.  A continuous real-valued function on a bounded closed interval attains its maximum and 
minimum on the interval. 
At  an  interior maximum  or minimum  x0  a  differentiable  function  f  satisﬁes  f � (x0 ) = 0.  If  f 
is  twice  differentiable  then  f  satisﬁes  the  additional  condition  f �� (x0 )  �  0  at  a  maximum  and 
f �� (x0 ) �  0 at a minimum.  Thus, at a positive interior maximum a twice-differentiable function f 
satisﬁes 
f � (x0 ) = 0,  and  f �� (x0 ) � 0. 
f (x0 ) > 0,
(10.1) 
At a negative interior minimum it satisﬁes 
f � (x0 ) = 0,  and  f �� (x0 ) � 0. 
f (x0 ) < 0,
(10.2) 
Our aim here is to show how (10.1) and (10.2) are used to obtain information about the solutions 
of differential equations. We adopt the convention that a < b and that y is continuous on the closed 
interval a � x � b or a � x < ∞, as the case may be, which is implicitly speciﬁed in the statement 
of the problem. The function y  is also twice differentiable on the interior. 

Example 10.2.  Show that the only solution of the boundary value problem 
y ��  + e y �  = (x 2  + 1)y , 
x 
y(a) = y(b) = 0 

is y = 0. 

SO LU T ION .  If  y  is  not  identically  zero  there must  be  a  positive maximum  or  a  negative min­
imum  at  some  point  c  where  a < c < b.  At  this  point  y � (c) = 0  and  the  differential  equation 
becomes 
y �� (c) = (c 2  + 1)y(c). 
So, either condition (10.1) or (10.2) leads to a contradiction. 

Equations (10.1) and (10.2) constitute the maximum principle in its broadest sense.  In a narrower 
sense,  the  term  “maximum  principle”  is  used  to  describe  an  estimate  for  y  on  a < x < b  from 
knowledge of the boundary values y(a) and y(b).

Example 10.3.  Suppose that y solves the differential equation 
(cos x)2 y ��  + x 2 (1 − x)y �  = 2y 
on  the  interval  a  �  x  �  b  and  |y(a)|, |y(b)|  �  m,  where  m  is  a  positive  constant.  Show  that 
|y(x)| < m for a < x < b. 
SOLU T ION .  If otherwise, either y  has a positive  interior maximum or a negative  interior mini­
mum. Either condition leads to a contradiction as in Example 10.2. 
It  is a consequence of Rolle’s  theorem  that  if y �  >  0 on an  interval  then y  is strictly  increasing. 
The relation y �  >  0  is an example of a differential  inequality.  Differential  inequalities  form a major 
subﬁeld of the modern theory of differential equations. 
Example 10.4.  Show that a function y satisfying 
x e y ��  + y � sin x − (1 + x)y � 0, 
and y(0) � 0, y � (0) > 0 must be strictly increasing. 
SOLU T ION .  If otherwise,  there are points x1  and x2  such  that 0  < x1  < x2  and y(x1 )  �  y(x2 ). 
It is obvious from a sketch that y  attains a positive maximum at an interior point c of the interval 
0  �  x  �  x2 .  (An analytic proof can be given by use of Theorem 10.1.)  At  the maximum we have 
y � (c) = 0, and the differential inequality becomes 
c e y �� (c) − (1 + c)y(c) � 0. 
Then, (10.1) leads to a contradiction. 

for  x > 0 

A zero of a function y  is a point where y(x) = 0.  In general, a solution of a second-order linear 
differential equation cannot have zeros too close together unless it is identically zero. 
Example 10.5.  Let y satisfy 

y ��  + e−x y �  = y sin x, 
x > 0 
and y(0) = y(b) = 0 where b > 0.  Show that b > π unless y  is identically zero. 
SOLU T ION .  Suppose that b �  π  and that y  is not identically zero for 0 < x < b.  Then there is a 
positive maximum or negative minimum at an interior point c of this interval. At c the differential 
equation  becomes  y �� (c) =  y(c) sin c  and  either  condition  (10.1)  or  (10.2)  lead  to  a  contradiction. 
Hence  y  = 0  on  the  interval  0  < x < b.  This  gives  y(b) =  y � (b) = 0  and  then  y  = 0  by  the 
uniqueness theorem for second-order initial value problems. 

Exercises. 
1.  Show that no nontrivial solution of 
w ��  + λq(x)w = 0,

w(a) = 0 = w(b) 

exists if q(x) > 0 and λ < 0. 
2.  Consider 
e cos x w ��  − x 2 w + x 3  = 0, 
for all x, 
where  w(0)  =  0.  Show  that  y  =  w − x  have  a  positive maximum  or  negative minimum  at  any 
value x = c.  Show also that the sign of w ��  is the same as the sign of w − x. 
3.  Show  that  the solution of  the DE (cosh x)y ��  + (cos x)y �  =  (1 + x2 )y  for a < x < b with y(a) = 
1 = y(b) satisﬁes 0 < y(x) < 1 for a < x < b.
