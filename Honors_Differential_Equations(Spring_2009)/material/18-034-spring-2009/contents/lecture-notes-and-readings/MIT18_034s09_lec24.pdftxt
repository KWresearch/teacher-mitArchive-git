LECTURE  24.  THE  TRANSFER  FUNCTION AND  THE  POLE DIAGRAM 

The transfer Function.  Throughout this section 
P (D) := Dn  + a1Dn−1  + · · · + an−1D + an , 
where  aj  are  real  constant.  Differential  equations  of  the  form  P (D)y  =  f  are  widely  used  to 
representing  electric  alternating  current networks  or ﬁlters.  Such  a ﬁlter may  be  thought  of  as  a 
“black  box”  into which  an  electric  current  or  a  voltage  is  fed  as  an  input  f (t) and  out  of which 
comes a resulting output y(t).

Mathematically,  it  amounts  to  studying  an  operator  transforming  the  input  function  f  into  a 
function y , the solution of p(D)y = f . Let us write formally y = W [f ]. Then, P (D)W [f ] = f . That 
is to say, such an input-output operator is a right inverse of P (D). 
In the simplest case, let f (t) = eat . Under the assumption P (a) = 0

Such a function transforming the input signal to the output is called the transfer function. The main 
property of the transfer function is 
(output) = (transfer function) · (input). 
Exercise.  For  a  sinusoidal  input  f (t) =  eiωt ,  where  ω  ∈  R,  show  that  W (ω) = 1/P (iω) unless 
P (iω) = 0.  (The case P (iω) = 0 corresponds to resonance.) 

f (t)  or  W (a) = 

y(t) = 

A  right  inverse  W  of  P (D)  is  not  deﬁned  unambiguously.  For,  P (D)y  =  f  does  not  have 
uniqueness. For initial value problems, one often deﬁnes W  by imposing the null initial conditions 
y(0) = y (cid:2) (0) = · · · = y (n−1) (0) = 0. 
For a broad class of inputs and outputs, we can characterize them by their Laplace transforms, 
and it naturally gives (Laplace transforms of) transfer functions.  In fact, if f  ∈ E , the rest solution 
of p(D)y = f  satisﬁes 
P (s)Y (s) = F (s)  or  Y (s) = W (s)F (s), 
(24.2) 
where W (s) = 1/P (s) is the transfer function. 
Note that the second equation in the above says that 
(output) = (transfer function) · (input), 
but the multiplication is in the s-domain. 
A major advantage of (24.2) is that it applies to an arbitrary f  ∈ E .  This increased scope of the 
transfer function is one of the advantages of working in the frequency domain.

Application:  feedback.  The transfer function is useful when two or more systems are connected 
together so that the output of one system becomes the input of another system. 
In  the  simplest  case  consider  the  upper  system  in  Figure  24.2. 
W1 
The coupled system is described by 
Y2  = W2 (s)Y1 .

Y1  = W1 (s)Y0 ,

Hence,

Y2  = W2 (s)W1 (s)Y0 . 
Figure 24.2. 
That means, the upper system in Figure 24.2 is equivalent to the lower system.  The transfer func­
tion for the whole system is the product of the individual transfer functions. 
A more complicated system is shown in Figure 24.3. Here, 
y1 
the  basic  system  is  the  one  with  W1  and  the  system  cor­
responding  to  W2  provides  a  feedback  to  the  system  W1 . 
Hence, the total input to W1  is 
W2 
Y1  = Y0  + W2 (s)Y2 . 
(1 − W1W2 )−1W1 
On the other hand, the feedback system is described as 
Y2  = W1 (s)Y1 . 
Figure 24.  3 
Eliminating Y1 , we ﬁnd a description of the total system 
Y2  = (1 − W1 (s)W2 (s))−1W1 (s)Y0 . 
Y2  = W2 (s)(Y0  + W2 (s)Y2 ),
Therefore, the upper system is equivalent to the lower system associated with the transfer function 
(1 − W1 (s)W2 (s))−1W1 (s). 
Application:  identiﬁcation.  In the problem of identiﬁcation, you put in a known input, measure 
the  output,  and  determine  the  parameters  in  the  differential  equation.  It  is  a  common  point  of 
view  in  experimental  sciences;  after  measuring  the  response  to  a  known  input,  one  can  try  to 
discover the mechanism by which the response was produced. 
When  the system  in study  takes  the  form P (D)y  = f , where  the differential operator  is deter­
mined by its characteristic polynomial, this characteristic polynomial is determined by its transfer 
function W (s) = 1/P (s). Thus, the problem of identiﬁcation reduces to one of ﬁnding the transfer 
function. 
In  the  very  simplest  case when  the  output  is  the  unit  impulse  f (t) = δ(t),  then F (s) = 1 and 
Y (s) = W (s).  The corresponding y(t) is called  the unit  impulse response.  In other words,  the unit 
impulse response it the transfer function. 
In the next simplest case when f (t) = h(t) is the unit step function,  then its Laplace transform

is F (s) = and

The  pole  diagram.  The  real  power  of  the  Laplace  transform  is  not  so  much  in  algorithms  for 
explicitly  computing  the  responses  to  the  systems  as  in  gaining  insight  into  the  systems without 
explicitly computing the responses.  For this purpose, it is better to think of the s-variable in F (s) 
as ranging over the complex numbers. 
In complex analysis,  a  function F (s), where s  ∈  C,  is  said  to have a pole at z  if  (s − z )nF (s) is 
holomorphic at z . The smallest positive integer n is called the order of the pole.  If n = 1, then it is 
called a simple pole. 
A  basic  example  is  F (s) = 1/(s − z ),  for  a  ﬁxed  complex  number  z .  Its magnitude  1/|s − z |
is a real-valued function on the complex plane, and  its graph  is a surface  lying over the complex 
plane, whose height over a point s is given by 1/|s − z |.  This  is a  tent-like surface  lying over  the 
complex plane, with elevation given by the reciprocal of the distance to z .  It sweeps up to inﬁnity 
like a hyperbola as s → z , as if the graph is held up at s = z by tent-pole.

A  rational  function F (s) which has only  simple poles  can be decomposed  into  its partial  frac­
tions as

F (s) = p(s) + 
s − zk

where p(s) is a polynomial, zj , wj  ∈ C; zj  are (simple) poles of F (s) and wj  =  lim (s − zj )F (s) is 
s→zj 
called the residue of the pole zj .  For example,

The  pole  diagram  of  F (s)  tells  us  about  long-term  behavior  of  f (t).  (Laplace  transforms  we 
typically  treat  are  rational  functions  with  simple  poles  only.  But,  they  are  not  always  rational 
functions, e.  g. L[δ(t − c)] = e−sc  is an entire function.  ) 
To illustrate it, we consider the functions 
1 − e−as 
ce−as

F1 (s) = 
F3 (s) = 
F2 (s) =

s 
where a, b  ∈  R and c  (cid:2)
= 0.  All three functions have two poles at s = 1.  (Note that 1 − e
−as  = 0 at
s = 0, canceling the zero in the denominator of the second term in F3 .) 
We assume that a � 0. They are the Laplace transforms of 
f2 (t) = ch(t − a)e t−a ,
f3 (t) = ch(t − a)e t  + bh(t − a). 
f1 (t) = ce t ,
All these functions grow like a multiple of et  when t is large.  You can even say which multiple; it 
is given by the residue at s = 1. But, their behavior when t < a is all over the map. 
Next, we consider the functions 
c(s − a) 
cb 
F2 (s) = 
F1 (s) = 
(s − a)2  + b2 
(s − a)2  + b2 
.
,
They have two poles at s = b ± ib, and they are the Laplace transforms of 
f1 (t) = ce at cos(bt),
f2 (t) = ce at sin(bt). 
This says that the real part of the pole determines the  long term growth  in maximum magnitude, 
and  the  imaginary  part  of  the  pole  determines  the  frequency  of  oscillation  for  large  t.  Again,  the 
pole diagram says nothing about the function for small t. 
We combine these observations and study

F (s) =

s − (−1 − i)
s − (−1 + i) 
. 
The function has poles at s = 1, s = −1 ± i, and we expect that the anti-transform f (t) has a term 
which  grows  like  et  (corresponding  to  the  pole  at  s  = 1)  and  another  term  which  behaves  like 
e−t cos t  (up  to  phase  shifts).  When  t  is  large,  the  term  from  the  rightmost  pole,  the  one with  the 
largest real part, dominates the behavior of f (t).  In fact,

grows like  et  for large t.

In summary, the position of the rightmost poles of F (s) determines the general behavior of f (t) 
for t (cid:5) 1.  If the rightmost pole is at a + bi, then f (t) wil behave roughly like a multiple of e(a+ib)t . 
That is, it grows like eat  and oscillates like cos bt.
