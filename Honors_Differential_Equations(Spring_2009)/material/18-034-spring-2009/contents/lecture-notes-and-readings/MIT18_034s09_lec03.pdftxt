LECTURE  3.  FIRST-ORDER  LINEAR  EQUATIONS 

First-order linear differential equations.  We will give a systematic method of solving ﬁrst-order 
differential equations (of normal form) 
y �  + p(x)y = f (x) 
(3.1) 
on a given interval I , where p, f  are continuous functions. 
First, the homogeneous equation 
� 
y �  + p(x)y = 0 
(3.2) 
is solved by quadrature. Let P (x) =  p(x)dx be an indeﬁnite integral of p(x). Then, 
d  (e P (x)y) = e P (x)y �  + p(x)e P (x)y = e P (x) (y �  + p(x)y) = 0 
dx
� 
if and only if y solves (3.2), since eP (x)  = 0. 
Theorem 3.1.  Let p(x) be continuous on an interval I  and P (x) =  p(x)dx be an anti-derivative of p(x). 
R 
Then, 
φ(x) = ce−P (x)  = ce−  p(x)dx 
is a solution of  (3.2) for any constant c. Conversely, all solutions of  (3.2) are of this form. 
Exercise.  Show that a solution y(x) of (3.2), where p(x) is continuous,  is:  either y(x) = 0 for all x 
or y(x) = 0 
for all x.

Next, we treat the inhomogeneous equation 
� 
y �  + p(x)y = f (x) 
(3.3) 
by variation of parameters. Let P (x) =  p(x)dx as before. Then, 
� 
d  (e P (x)y) = e P (x) (y �  + p(x)y) = e P (x)f (x). 
dx
e P (s)f (s)ds for some y0  and for some x0 . 
Hence, ye P (x)  = y0  + 
x0 
Theorem 3.2.  Let p(x) be as in Theorem 3.1 and let f (x) be continuous on an interval x0  ∈  I .  Then, the 
� 
general solution of  (3.3) is given by 
� 
y(x) = y0e−P (x)  + e−P (x) 
x0 
x 
Moreover, y(x0 ) = y0  if and only if P (x) =  x
0 
Example 3.3.  Consider the differential equation 
y �  + y = x + 3. 
(3.4) 
By trying y(x) = ax + b one easily ﬁnds a solution y = x + 2 of (3.4).  If y = φ(x) is another solution 
of (3.4), then z = y − (x + 2) must satisfy the corresponding homogeneous equation z � + z = 0. By 
Theorem 3.2, then, z = ce−x . Therefor, the general solution of (3.4) is 
y = ce−x  + x + 2.

Exercise.  (Bernoulli equations) 1.  If p and q  are continuous  functions of x and n  =�
show that the Bernoulli equation 

1  is constant, 

y �  + p(x)y = q(x)y n , 
y > 0 
can  be  reduced  to  a  linear  equation  upon  substitution  y  =  u for  a  suitable  constant  m.  The 
m
condition  y >  0  ensures  that  the  function  u  =  y1/m  is  meaningful.  When  n  = 1  the  original 
equation is already linear. 
2.  Solve the differential equation y �  + y = xy3 , y > 0. 

The  logarithmic  spiral.  Suppose  a  curve  r  =  f (θ)  in polar  coordinates  cuts  the  radius  at  a  con­
stant angle, say ψ , as shown in the ﬁgure below. 

Figure 3.1. The logarithmic spiral. 

The game  is  to ﬁnd  the  equation of  this  curve.  If ψ  = 0  the  curve  is  a  ray  extending  from  the 
origin  to ∞ and  it cannot be represented  in  the  form r  =  f (θ).  If ψ  =  π/2 or −π/2  the curve  is a 
circle centered at he origin.  If

we write tan ψ =

and therefore r = cekθ . 
A curve of this kind is called a logarithmic spiral. The steps in the discussion above are reversible, 
and hence a curve r  =  f (θ) cuts  the radius at a constant angle ψ  satisfying  (3.5)  if, and only  if,  it 
is  a  logarithmic  spiral.  Since  k  is  arbitrary,  this  gives  a  geometric  interpretation  of  all  processes 
obeying the exponential law of growth. 
A  logarithmic  spiral  looks  like  a  snail  shell  (Figure  3.1),  and  this  is  not  a  coincidence.  A  snail 
shell  has  the  characteristic  that  it  grows  only  at  one  end,  and  the  part  of  the  shell  already  laid 
down does not change. The growth is speciﬁed by its rate in two perpendicular directions - radial

and  transverse.  Let us  suppose  that both  rates are proportional  to  the  size at  time  t.  The precise 
meaning of ”size” will not matter, and we use the weight W  as a quantity that is easily measured. 
If arc length in the radial direction is s1  and in the transverse direction is s2 , then 
ds1  = k1W  and 
ds2  = k2W, 
dt 
dt 
where k1 , k2  are constants. The arc length in polar coordinates thus satisﬁes 
ds2  = dr2  + (rdθ)2 . 
Setting dθ = 0 we get ds1  = dr and setting dr = 0 we get ds2  = rdθ . Dividing the second equation 
in (3.7) by the ﬁrst, we arrive at 

rdθ 
k2 = 
. 
dr 
k1 
This is the same equation as in (3.6) with k = k1/k2 .
