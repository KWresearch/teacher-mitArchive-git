LECTURE  12.  SOLUTION  BASES 

We present the results pertaining to the linear differential equation 
· · · 
L0y = y (n)  + p1y (n−1)  +
+ pn−1y �  + pny
(12.1) 
with constant coefﬁcients.  Some results we establish apply to equations with variable coefﬁcients. 
· · · 
Let p(λ) =  λn  + p1λ(n−1)  +
+ pn−1λ + pn  be the characteristic polynomial corresponding to 
L0 .  By the fundamental theorem of algebra∗, p is factored into linear factors in the complex ﬁelds 
as 
· · · 
(λ − λm )km ,
p(λ) = (λ − λ1 )k1 (λ − λ2 )k2 
where λj  are (complex) roots of p(λ) and kj  � 1 are the multiplicity of λj . 
We recall from the last lecture that the functions 
· · · 
· · · 
tr e λj t , 
, λj−1 ,  and  j  = 1, 2, 
where  r = 0, 1, 
, m, 
are  (complex)  solutions  of  L0y  = 0.  Moreover,  each  pair  of  complex  conjugate  roots,  λj  = 
µ  +  iνj ,  λ  =  µj  −  iνj ,  with  µj , νj  ∈  R,  gives  real  solutions  tr eµj t cos νj t,  tr eµj t sin νj t,  where 
¯ 
· · · 
r = 0, 1, 
, kj−1 , of L0y = 0.
Our goal  is  to  show  that  all  solutions of L0y  = 0  are  linear  combinations of  these n  solutions. 
Namely, these solutions form a basis of solutions of L0y = 0. 
Linear  independence.  There  are  two  notions  of  linear  independence,  depending  on  the  scalar 
· · · 
ﬁeld.  A  set  os  n  real  or  complex  functions  f1 , 
, fn  deﬁned  on  an  interval  I  is  said  linearly 
independent over the real ﬁeld if 
c1f1 (t) + c2f2 (t) +  + cnfn (t) = 0  on I ,  cj  ∈ R, 
· · · 
cj  = 0 
for all j. 
implies 
We  may  deﬁne,  similarly,  a  set  of  real  or  complex  functions  to  be  linearly  independent  over  the 
complex ﬁeld. 
Lemma 12.1.  A  set  of  real-valued  functions  on  an  interval  I  is  linearly  independent  over  the  real ﬁeld  if 
and only if it is linearly independent over the complex ﬁeld. 
Next, we state the main result of this subsection. 
Lemma 12.2.  Any set of functions of the form 
· · · 
frj (t) = tr e λj t ,
j  = 1, 2, 
(12.2) 
, n, 
where the r  are nonnegative integers and λj  ∈ C,  is linearly independent on any nonempty open interval, 
unless two or more of the functions are identical.

Proof.  Suppose that frj (t) are all distinct.  Suppose that 
crj frj (t) = 0 on an open interval of t, but crj  = 0 
for some r and j. 
Fix such a j , and choose R to be the largest r such that crj  = 0

We form a linear differential operator of constant coefﬁcient 
(D − λi )ki+1 , 
p(D) = (D − λj )R

Corollary  12.3.  The  differential  equation  L0y  = 0,  where  L0  is  given  in  (12.1),  has  at  least  n  linearly 
independent, real or complex solutions of the form tr eλt . 
The differential equation L0y = 0, where pj  are real constants, has a set of n solutions of the form 
tr eµt sin ν t 
tr eµt cos ν t, 
tr e λt , 
or 
which is linearly independent over the real ﬁeld in any nonempty interval. 
Solution  bases.  We  now  show  that  all  solutions  of  the  homogeneous  equation  L0y  = 0,  where 
L0  is  given  in  (12.1)  and  pj  are  real,  are  linear  combinations  of  the  special  solutions  obtained  in 
Corollary 12.3. To this end, we establish some results for the more general equation 
· · · 
Ly = y (n)  + p1 (t)y (n−1)  +
+ pn−1 (t)y �  + pn (t)y = 0,
(12.3) 
where pj (t) are real-valued continuous functions on an interval I . 
The solution set, denoted by N (L), of Ly = 0 is a collection of solutions of Ly = 0. 

Exercise.  Show that N (L) forms a linear subspace of C n (I ). 

A basis of solutions of Ly = 0 is then deﬁned as a basis of N (L), as a linear space.  In other words, 
any  solution of Ly  = 0  is uniquely expressed as a  linear combination of members  in  the basis of 
solutions. 
We associate to the differential equation Ly = 0, where L is given in (12.3), a transformation 
→ 
· · · 
T y = (y(t0 ), y � (t0 ), 
, y n−1 (t0 )).
T  : N (L)  Rn , 
It is clear that T  is linear. We show that T  is one-to-one. That is, Ly = 0 has uniqueness. 
Lemma 12.4.  (Uniqueness) If y  is a real or complex solution of Ly = 0, where L is given in (12.3) and pj 
are real-valuead continuous in the closed interval I  containing t0 , and if 
· · · 
y(t0 ) = y � (t0 ) =  = y (n−1) (t0 ) = 0,

then y(t) = 0 for all t ∈ I . 
Proof.  The proof is similar to that for the second-order equations.  If y  is a real solution, then let 
· · · 
E (t) = y 2 (t) + (y � (t))2  +  + (y (n−1) (t))2

exercise.  If  y  is  a  complex  solution,  then  its  real  and  imaginary  parts  are  both  real  solutions  of

Ly = 0 satisfying the initial conditions. This completes the proof.

Furthermore,  if  we  show  that  T  is  onto,  that  is,  for  any  n-vector  (y0 , y1 , 
differential equation Ly = 0 has a solution satisfying the initial conditions 
· · · 
, y (n−1) (t0 ) = yn−1 ,
y(t0 ) = y0 , 
then it implies that T  is an isomorphism.  In particular, the dimension of N (L) is n.  Thus, a basis 
of solutions of Ly = 0 consists of n functions. 
If the coefﬁcients of L are real constants, that is, L = L0  where L0  is in (12.1), then Ly = 0 has a 
n linearly independent (real) solutions of the form 
tr e λt ,
tr eµt cos ν t, 
tr eµt sin ν t. 
In  this  case,  these  n  solutions  form  a  basis  of  solutions  of  Ly  = 0.  This  result  holds  true  for 
equations with real-variable coefﬁcients.

The  Euler-Cauchy  equation.  There  are  only  a  few  interesting  classes  of  n-th  order  linear  equa­
tions for which a basis of solutions can be expressed in terms of elementary functions.  One is the 
class of equations with constant coefﬁcients, which we discussed. Another is the class of equations 
of the form

x n y (n)  + p1x n−1 y (n−1)  +

where  y k  = 
is  the  k-th  derivative  with  respect  to  x  and  pj  are  constants.  An  equation  of 
dxk 
this form is called Cauchy’s equi-dimensional equation, although equations of this kind were studied 
earlier by Euler. 
The substitution x  =  et  leads to an equation with constant coefﬁcients and a basis of solutions 
consists of functions of the form 
tr e λt ,

tr eµt cos ν t, 

tr eµt sin ν t. 

In terms of x, then

xµ sin(ν log x).
