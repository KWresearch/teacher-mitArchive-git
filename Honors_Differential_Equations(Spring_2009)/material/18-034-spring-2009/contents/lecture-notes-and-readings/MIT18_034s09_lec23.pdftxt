Impulse  signals:  Dirac’s  idea.  Let  a >  0 be  small.  Let  fa (t) be  identically  zero  except  for  the 
interval  t  ∈  [0, a] and 
fa (t)dt  (cid:3)= 0.  If  the  integral  is  not  very  small  then  fa (t) 
fa (t)dt  = 
−∞ 
must be quite large in the interval t ∈  [0, a], and the function describes the “impulsive” behavior. 
0 
An  “impulsive  function”  means  a  signal  which  acts  for  a  very  short  time  but  produces  a  large 
effect.  The  physical  situation  is  exempliﬁed  by  a  lightning  stroke  on  a  transmission  line  or  a 
hammer blow on a mechanical system.

In  the  early  1930’s  the  Nobel  Prize  winning  physicist  P.  A.  M.  Dirac  developed  a  controver­
sial  method  for  dealing  with  impulsive  functions.  Let  a  →  0+.  The  function  fa (t)/(  fa (t) dt) 
approaches  to,  say,  δ(t) which  takes zero  for  t  = 0
and  the  integral of δ(t) over any  interval con­
taining 0 is the unity. The function δ(t) is called “the Dirac delta function”. 
(cid:4) 
To formulate the Dirac delta function, let a > 0 and let 
t ∈ [0, a)

In this sense, δ(t) describes the effect of 
L[δ(t)] = 1. 
(23.2) 
Let us say that no ordinary function with the property (23.1) exists, and whatever else δ(t) may 
be,  it  is not  a  function of  t!  However,  says Dirac,  one  formally  treats  δ(t) as  if  it were  a  function 
and gets the right answer.

function  on  a  ﬁrm mathematical  foundation.  He  accomplished  this  by  enlarging  the  class  of  all 
functions so as to include the delta function, called it the class of distributions. 
Here,  we  ﬁrst  explore  the  usefulness  of  δ(t)  in  (23.1),  and  then  we  indicate  its  mathematical 
meaning. 
Examples.  Let us consider the initial value problem 
(cid:4)(cid:4)  + y = δ(t),
(cid:4) (0) = 0. 
y(0) = y

Taking the transform, 

Ly =

y(t) = h(t) sin t. 

(cid:4) (0) = 0. 
y(0) = y

s2  + 1
Here, we use (23.2). 
The solution y  is continuous for all t ∈  (−∞, ∞) and it satisﬁes the differential equation every­
where except t  = 0. At t  = 0, however,  it satisﬁes neither  the differential equation nor  the  initial 
condition.  It  is  not  even  differentiable  at  t  = 0.  Indeed,  y (cid:4) (0+)  = 1  and  y (cid:4) (0−) = 0.  The  unit 
impulse signal δ(t) produces a jump of magnitude 1 in y (cid:4) (t) at t = 0. 
(cid:4) 
Let us now consider 
t ∈ [0, a) 
1/a, 
(cid:4)(cid:4)  + y = fa (t) =

We write fa (t) =  (h(t) − h(t − a)). Taking the transform then gives

As a → 0+, the second interval t ∈ (0, a) vanishes, and the third interval t ∈ [a, ∞) tends to [0, ∞) 
and the functional expression on this interval tends to sin t.  In other words, as a →  0 the solution 
ya (t) gives  the  same  solution as was obtained with  δ(t).  We note  that an uncritical use of  δ(t) as 
in  (23.1)  and  (23.2)  gives  the  correct  answer  as  obtained  by  a  conventional  passage  to  the  limit. 
Moreover, the conventional method is much more difﬁcult.  It is where the usefulness of δ(t) lies.

Theory  of  distributions.  We  conclude  the  lecture  with  a  very  brief  description  of  the  germ  of 
Laurent Schwartz’s brilliant idea. 
A  function  is  characterized  by  giving  its  value  at  each  t. A  distribution  δ(t)  is  characterized, 
not  by  its  value  at  t,  but  by  giving  its  value  δ{φ}  on  a  suitable  class  of  functions  φ,  called  test 
functions.  Test  functions are assumed  to have derivatives of all orders and  to vanish outside of a 
(cid:2)  ∞ 
ﬁnite interval. 
Let us deﬁne δ as 
(23.3) 
−∞ 
(cid:2)  ∞ 
for  any  test  function  φ.  We  note  here  that  we  cannot  speak  of  the  value  of  δ(t)  at  t.  The  only 
δ(t)φ(t) dt. The distribution δ(t) is never used alone, but only in com­
meaningful quantity is 
−∞ 
bination with functions. 
If δ(t) were a  function and  if  the  integral  in  (23.3) were an ordinary  integral,  then by a change 
(cid:2)  ∞ 
(cid:2)  ∞ 
of variables, 
δ(t − c)φ(t) dt = 
−∞ 
−∞ 
By  (23.3)  the  right  side  gives  the  value  of  φ(t + c)  at  t  = 0,  that  is,  φ(c).  Now we  take  it  as  the 
(cid:2)  ∞ 
deﬁnition of the left side. Thus, δ(t − c) is deﬁned as 
δ(t − c)φ(t) dt = φ(c) 
−∞ 
for any test function φ. 
Similarly, if δ (cid:4) (t) were a continuously differentiable function, then an integration by parts would 
(cid:2)  ∞ 
(cid:2)  ∞ 
yield 
δ (cid:4) (t)φ(t) dt = − 
δ(t)φ(cid:4) (t) dt. 
−∞ 
−∞ 
(cid:2)  ∞ 
By (23.3) the right side is −φ(cid:4) (0), and again we take it to deﬁne δ (cid:4) (t) as 
δ (cid:4) (t)φ(t) dt = −φ(cid:4) (0) 
−∞ 
(cid:2)  ∞ 
for any test function φ. With the same line of thought, δ (n) (t − c) is deﬁned as 
δ (n) (t − c)φ(t) dt = (−1)nφ(n) (c)

δ(t)φ(t + c) dt.

With the choice φ(t) = e−st , where s is a constant, we obtain

−st δ(t − c) dt =

when  c �  0.  When  c < 0 the  result  is zero.  If  c = 0 then  the above gives  the  formula Lδ(t) = 1, 
which agrees with (23.2). 
These are deﬁnitions, but the discussion shows that the deﬁnitions are consistent with the ordi­
nary rules of calculus.  This is the reason why δ(t) can be treated as a function of the real variable 
t even though it is not a function. 
Finally, assume that y(t) = 0 for t < 0 and y (cid:4) (t) = δ(t) for t > 0. The Laplace transform suggests 
that sLy = 1, and  in  turn, y agrees with the Heaviside function h(t) except perhaps at t = 0.  (At 
t = 0, neither the physics nor the mathematics of the problem is clear.)  In this sense, 
h(cid:4) (t) = δ(t).
