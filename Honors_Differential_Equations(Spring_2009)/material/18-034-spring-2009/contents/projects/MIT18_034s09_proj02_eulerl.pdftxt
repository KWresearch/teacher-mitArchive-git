LIMITATIONS  OF  EULER’S  METHOD  FOR 

NUMERICAL  INTEGRATION


LAURA  EVANS. 

1.  Introduction 

Not all diﬀerential  equations  can be  explicitly  solved  for y .  This  can 
be  problematic  if  we  need  to  know  the  value  of  y  at  a  speciﬁc  point. 
This is where methods of numerical integration are useful, as they allow 
us  to  estimate  the  value  of  y  based  on  known  initial  conditions. 
One  of  these  methods  for  numerical  integration  is  Euler’s  Method, 
which  will  be  the  sub ject  of  the  following  discussion.  Although  not 
the most  accurate  of methods,  it  is  one  of  the  simplest, which  is  useful 
when beginning  to understand  these methods.  Essentially,  the method 
works  by  ﬁnding  the  slope  at  a  known,  traveling  in  a  small  amount  h 
in  that  direction,  then  calculating  the  new  slope  and  traveling  in  the 
direction  of  the  new  slope,  and  so  on. 
Euler’s  method  is  an  iterative  method.  Consider  the  initial  value 
problem 

y � (x) = f (x, y(x))
y(a) = y0 
We proceed  in steps of size h,  so x0  = a and xn+1  = xn + h.  For each 
step,  then, 

(1) 

yn+1  = yn  + hf (xn , yn ) 
This  allows  us  to  approximate  the  value  of  y  at  a  point  x,  given  the 
initial  data. 
Because  of  its  relative  simplicity  as  a  numerical  method,  Euler’s 
method  is  limited  in  its  scope,  as  I  will  discuss  in  this  paper1 . 

2.  Error 

Proposition  2.1.  Euler’s  method  produces  an  answer  with  accuracy 
o(h). 

Date : May  18,  2007. 
1This discussion is based on material found on Section 1.8 of Birkhoﬀ Rota, with 
some  inspiration  for  examples  drawn  from  the Wikipedia  entry  on Euler’s Method.

Proof.  Consider  the  Taylor  expansion  of  y(x)  around  a + h: 
y(a + h) = y(a) + hy � (a) + o(|h2 |) 

But  Euler’s method  gives 

y(a + h) = y(a) + hy � (a) 

Since  the  error  is  the  diﬀerence  between  the  two  equations, we  can  see 
that  the  error  in  this  ﬁrst  step  is  o(|h2 |). 
The way Euler’s method  is  commonly  used  is  to  set h  equal  to  some 
small fraction of the diﬀerence between the desired value and the known 
value.  Thus,  the  number  of  steps  needed  to  reach  the  desired  value  is 
o(| 1 |),  so  the  total  error  accumulated  upon  reaching  the  desired  value 
is  o(|h|). 
h 
� 

One  consequence  of  this  is  that  if  we  want  an  additional  decimal 
place of accuracy  in our answer, we must use a new h  that  is one-tenth 
the  original.  This means  we must  do  a  signiﬁcantly more  calculations. 
Thus, we  see  that Euler’s method  is not  eﬃcient  for ﬁnding answers  to 
a  high  accuracy. 

3.  Demonstration 

Let us  observe  the  behavior  of  solutions  found  using Euler’s method 
on  the  equation  y �  =  ky ,  with  initial  value  y(0) =  1  for  various  values 
of  k <  0  We  know  that  this  equation  has  solution  y(x) =  xkt ,  so  we 
can  compare  the  values  given  by  this method  to  the  real  values. 
First, we will  consider k = −1.  The  true values and  the values given 
by  Euler’s method  with  h = 0.5  are  given  below. 
y 
x 
yn

0.5 
0.5  0.61 
1  0.25  0.37 
Clearly,  this  is  not  very  accurate.  We  can  improve  its  accuracy,  as 
we  saw  above,  by  decreasing  the  value  of  h.  The  following  table  shows 
the  same  function,  with  h = 0.1

0.8  0.43  0.45 
0.9  0.39  0.41 
1  0.35  0.37 
From this we see that the smaller value of h gives much more accurate 
values for y  in our test case.  In addition, we can see that the error does 
remain  less  than  h,  although  it  does  increase  as  x  increases. 

4.  Failure 

Now,  let  us  consider  the  same  equation  as  the  previous  section,  but 
with larger values of |k |.  In particular, we will look at k = −3, k = −11, 
and  k = −21.  First,  we  will  use  h = 0.5.  Readers  should  note  that  all 
data  in  the  following  table  is  rounded  to  the  second  decimal  place. 
k = −3  k = −11  k = −21

The values for the ﬁrst 2 k  seem reasonable, but something seems oﬀ 
about  the  values  that  Euler’s  method  has  given  us  for  k  = −21.  Let’s 
decrease  h  to  see  if  the  problem  goes  away. 
Let’s  set  h  equal  to  0.1,  as  before.  Again,  values  are  rounded  to  the 
second  decimal  place.

From  this,  we  can  see  that  the  problem  has  not  gone  away  - in  fact, 
it  has  gotten  worse.  Rather  than  approximating  the  curve,  the  values 
that Euler’s method gives  for k = −21 oscillate around  the curve, with 
growing  amplitude.  Holistically,  it  is  easy  to  see  what  the  problem  is. 
When  the  method  makes  its  ’step’  of  length  h,  it  assumes  that  y �  will 
remain  about  constant  over  that  small  distance.  However,  this  is  not 
the  case  for y �  = −21y .  Over a distance h,  y �  changes  relatively  largely 
compared  to h.  The  same  is  true whenever we  have  an  equation  of  the 
form  y �  = ky ,  k � 0. 
We  can  expand  this  discussion  to  realize  that  whenever  y �  changes 
rapidly  near  y0 ,  Euler’s  method  will  not  be  accurate.  Thus,  use  of 
Euler’s method should be limited to cases when max{|y �� (x0±�)|} � ∞, 
for  some  neighborhood  �  near  x0 . 

5.  Improvements 

Euler’s  method  is  a  ﬁrst  order  numerical  approximation:  each  new 
value  depends  only  on  the  value  immediately  before  it.  This  is  part  of 
the  reason  that  it  can  be  aﬀected  as  we  saw  previously. 
One  way  of  improving  Euler’s  method  is  to  use  a  second  order  ver­
sion: 

y(a) =  ya 
y1  =  hf (a, y0 ) 
h 
yn+2  =  yn  + (f (xn , yn ) + f (xn+1 , yy+1 ))

Let  us  consider  what  y2  is  in  this  version.

h

y2  =  y0  + (f (x0 , y0 ) + f (x1 , y1 ))
2 
h 
=  ya  + (y � (a) + f (h, hf (a, y0 )))
2 
h 
=  ya  + (y � (a) + f (h, hy � (a)))
2 
h 
=  ya  + (y � (a) + y � (a) + hy �� (a))
2 
h2 
=  ya  + hy � (a) + 
y �� (a)
2 
This  is  only  o(h3 )  away  from  the  second  order  Taylor  expansion  of 
y(x)  near  a.  By  similar  reasoning  as  the  proof  above,  then,  we  can 
assume  that  this  will  yield  much  greater  accuracy  than  the  original, 
even  with  the  same  h. 

6.  Conclusion 

After  this  exploration  of  Euler’s  method,  we  have  learned  several 
things  about  when  it  should  be  used  and  when  other  numerical meth­
ods  would  be  more  appropriate.  In  particular,  Euler’s  method  is  not 
the best choice when |y � | takes on large values near the initial data, nor 
when a  computationally  eﬃcient method  is  required.  Although we  can 
improve  the  method  slightly,  by  considering  more  than  the  immedi­
ately previous point,  this  improvement  is  limited.  In many cases,  then, 
Euler’s method  is  not  the most  appropriate  numerical method.
