***** Optional Final Project *****
The purpose of the final project is to get each of you something interesting to
think about on differential equations, to learn theories/methods for yourself
or with your fellow classmates, and to exercise communicating with other people
by a mathematical writing.
You will study about your own topic for about two weeks and submit a report of
about five pages by the last class session. Although the project is optional,
if you choose to do one, it will be graded. By completing the project work, a
student may earn up to 5% in the final grade. You are encouraged to work in
group.
The project report must be written in a manner that a fellow classmate in
18.034 could understand what you have done and reproduce the work on the basis
of what you have written.
***** Project Suggestions *****
Some sample topics include:
    * Green's functions for the Dirichlet boundary condition;
    * Solution by a power series method and the method of majorants;
    * Smoothness of the initial value problem;
    * The stationary Schrodinger equation as a Sturm-Liouville system;
    * Numerical methods of solving differential equations;
    * Planetary motion and conservation laws;
    * Bifurcation theory and elastic rods;
    * Can one hear the shape of a drum?
    * Linear instability of a free-surface shear flows due to boundary
      singularity, etc.
Please feel free to come up with your own idea!
