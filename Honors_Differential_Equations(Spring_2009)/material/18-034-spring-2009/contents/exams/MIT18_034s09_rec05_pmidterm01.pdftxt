18.034 Practice Midterm #1 

1.  Solve the initial value problem 
y ��  − 3y 2  = 0,
y(0) = 2, y � (0) = 4.

(a) Sketch the graph of f (y) = (1 − y)(y − 2)3 . 
(b) Determine the critical points (stationary solutions). 
(c) Discuss the stability of critical points in part (b). 
3.	 Determine the values of a, if any, for which all solutions of the differential equation 
y ��  − (2a − 1)y �  + a(a − 1)y = 0 
tend  to  zero  as  t  → ∞.  Also,  determine  the values of a,  if  any,  for which  all  (nonzero)  solutions 
become unbounded as t → ∞.
