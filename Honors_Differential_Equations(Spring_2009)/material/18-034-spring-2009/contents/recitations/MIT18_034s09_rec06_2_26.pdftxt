1.  Under  what  conditions  on  b  and  k  do  al l  solutions  y (t) to 

y  ′′  +  by  ′  +  ky  = 0 

tend  to  zero  as  t  → ∞?  What  is  the  physical  signiﬁcance  of  these  condi­

tions  for  a  spring  system? 

2.  Let  u  and  v  be  continuous  and  linearly  independent  on  an  interval  I . 

Suppose  w  is  a  function  on  I  with  only  ﬁnitely  many  zeros. 

(a)  Show  that  wu  and  wv  are  linearly  independent  on  I . 

(b)  You  can’t  use  the  Wronskian  in  this  problem.  Why  not? 

(c)  Show  that  the  result  can  fail  if  u  and  v  are  not  continuous. 

3.  Show  that  e t ,  e −t ,  and  e 2t  are  linearly  independent  on  R  without  using 

the Wronskian. 

4.  Show  that  a  function  y  satisfying 

e x y  ′′  + (sin x)y  ′  − (1 + x)y  ≥  0,

y (0) ≥  0, y  ′ (0) >  0,


must  be  strictly  increasing.


5.  Consider  the  problem 

′′ w  +  λqw  = 0, w(a) =  w(b) = 0 

where  λ  ∈  R  and  q  =  q(x) is  a positive function  of  x.  Show  that  there  are 

no  non-trivial  solutions  if  λ <  0.
