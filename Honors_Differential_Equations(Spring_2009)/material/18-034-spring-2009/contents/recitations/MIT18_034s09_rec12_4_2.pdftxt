1.  Find  the  rest  solution  to  the  ODE 

y �  + 2y = e 3t . 

2.	

(a)  Suppose  |f (t)| ≤  C |eat |  for  some  a >  0.  Show  that  if  F (s) = 
Q(s)/P (s)  for  polynomials  P  and  Q,  then  deg P > deg Q. 
(b)  Show  that  if  |f � (t)| ≤ C eat  then  lims→∞ sF (s) = f (0). 

3.  Find  the  Laplace  transforms  of 

(a)  f (t) = cosh t sin t, 

(b)	

�  t  sin θ 
dθ , 
θ
0 
(c)  h(t) = e−t (in  as  explicit  a  form  as  you  can).

4.  Find  the  inverse  transform  of 

F (s) =	

2s3  + 6s2  + 21s + 52
