1.  Suppose  y0 (x) is  a  solution  to  the  equation 

′ y  + 2xy =  f (x) 

with  y0 (0) = 3.  Find  a  solution  y1 (x) with  y1 (0) = 1. 

2.  (Birkhoﬀ-Rota,  p.  17,  #5)  For  what  pairs  of  positive  integers  n,  r  is  the 
function  fn (x) =  |x|n  of  class  C r ? 

3.  Show  that  the  equation 

(3e 2y x 2
3  − x)y ′  = 1 

becomes  an  equation  of  Bernoulli  type  if  x  and  y  are  interchanged.  Solve 

that  equation  and  obtain  an  equation  for  x.  Find  an  explicit  formula  for 

y =  y (x) for  the  solution  satisfying  y (1) = 0. 

4.  Find  equations  for  the  family  of  curves  orthogonal  to  the  curves  xy  =  c. 
2 
Do  the  same  for  the  families  y =  cex  . 

5.  Suppose  that  y  is  a  solution  to 

(x 2  + 1)y ′  +  y 2  + 1  = 0 

with  y (0) =  c > 0.  Prove  that  y  is  decreasing  and  limxց−1/c y (x) =  ∞.
