1.  Consider  the  diﬀerential  equation  y ��  + y = h(t) − h(t − c)  for  c > 0. 

(a)  Use  the  Laplace  transform  to  ﬁnd  the  rest  solution. 
(b)  Show  that  y  and  y �  are  continuous  at  t = c  but  y ��  is  not. 

2.  Consider  the  equation  y (n)  = δ ,  where  y(t) = 0  for  t < 0.  Suppose  that  y 
is  “maximally  regular”  at  0,  i.e.,  as  many  derivatives  of  y  as  possible  are 
continuous  at  0.  Show  that  y (n−1)  has  a  jump  of  magnitude  1  at  t = 0. 
(a)  For n ≥ 0, what is the action of the distribution δ (n)  on a test function 
φ? 
(b)  Explore the continuity of rest solutions to y ��� (t) = f (t) for the choices 
t,  1,  δ(t),  δ � (t),  δ ��  of  f (t).

4.  The  following  boundary-value  problem  models  the  equation  of  the  central 
line  y(x),  0  ≤  x  ≤  2,  of  a  uniform  weightless  beam  anchored  at  one  end 
and  carrying  a  concentrated  load  at  its  center. 

y (iv)  = 6δ(x − 1),

y(0) = y � (0) = y �� (2) = y ��� (2). 

(a)  With  y �� (0) = 2a,  y ��� (0) = 6b,  ﬁnd  y  via  Y (s). 

(b)  Determine  a  and  b  from  the  boundary  conditions  at  x = 2.
