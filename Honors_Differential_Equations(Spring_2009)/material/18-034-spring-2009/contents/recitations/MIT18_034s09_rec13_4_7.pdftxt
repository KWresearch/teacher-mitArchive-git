1.  Volterra  integral/Tautochrone  example. 

2.  Suppose  that  f  and  g  are  piecewise  continuous  functions.  Verify  the  fol­
lowing  properties  of  their  convolution. 
(a)  f  ∗ g = g ∗ f . 
(b)  If  f  ∈ C 1 ,  then  f  ∗ g  is  C 1  and  (f  ∗ g)�  = f �  ∗ g . 

3.  Use  the  Heaviside  expansion  to  ﬁnd  an  expression  for  the  rest  solution  to 
the  equation


y ��  + 5y �  + 6y = f (t).


Verify  your  answer  against  the  known  solution  in  the  case  f (t) = 1. 

4.	 (Heaviside  superposition  formula)  Let  T  be  a  linear  diﬀerential  operator 
with  time-independent  coeﬃcients.  Suppose  that  f �  is  piecewise  continu­
ous,  and  f  continuous,  and  let  φ  be  the  rest  solution  to  T φ =  h(t)  (here 
h(t) denotes the unit step function).  Express the rest solution to T y = f (t) 
in  terms  of  φ. 
5.  Consider  the  diﬀerential  equation  y ��  + y = h(t) − h(t − c)  for  c > 0. 

(a)  Use  the  Laplace  transform  to  ﬁnd  the  rest  solution. 
(b)  Show  that  y  and  y �  are  continuous  at  t = c  but  y ��  is  not.
