1.  Consider  the  equation  y ′′ + y ′  = 2y .  For  what  a  is  eay  a  solution?  Find  a 
′′ 
′′′ 
′′′′ 
solution  y0  to  y  +  y  = 2y  with  exponential  growth  as  x → −∞  and 

limx→∞ y0 (x)/x = 1. 

2.  Suppose  that  if  y0  is  a  solution  to  y ′′ + y ′ − 2y =  F (x) on  all  of (−∞, ∞), 

then  there  is  another  solution  y1  to  the  same  equation  with 

|y1 (x) − y0 (x)| →  0  as  x → ∞. 

3.  Show  that  y =  e and  y = cos x cannot be solutions of  the same  ﬁrst-order 
x

equation  y  =  f (x, y ) on  any  interval  containing  the  origin.

4.  Solve  ydx + 3xdy = 14y 4dy . 

5.  Suppose  that  a tra jectory  of (3x2  − y )dx + (3y 2  − x)dy  =  0  contains  the 

point (1, 1).  Show that it  also  contains the points (1, −1), (−1, 1), (0, 1), 

(1, 0). 

6.  (Birkhoﬀ-Rota:  p.  6,  #  7) Show  that  solutions  of  y  =  g (y ) are  convex  up 
′

or  convex down for given  y  according  as  |g | is  an  increasing  or  decreasing 

function there.
