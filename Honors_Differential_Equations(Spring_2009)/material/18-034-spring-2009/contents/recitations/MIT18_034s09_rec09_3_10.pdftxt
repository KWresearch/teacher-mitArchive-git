1.  Let  I  ⊂  R  be  an  interval  and  recall  that  a  function  f  :  I  →  R  is said  to be 

Lipschitz  on  I  if  there  is  a  constant  C  such  that  |f (x) − f (y )| ≤ C |x − y | 

for  all  x,  y  ∈  I . 

(a)  Show  that  if  f  is  Lipschitz  on  I , then  f  ∈  C (I ). 

(b)  Show  that  if  f  is  diﬀerentiable  on  I  with bounded derivative, then  f 

is  Lipschitz  on  I . 

(c)  Show  that  f (x) =  |x| is  Lipschitz  on  R. 

(d)  Show  that  f (x) =  e is  not  Lipschitz  on  R.

2.  (Birkhoﬀ-Rota,  p.  62,  #3) 

Solve 

y ′′  + 3y ′  + 2y =  x 3 

for  the  initial  conditions  y ′ (0) =  y (0) = 0. 

3.  (Birkhoﬀ-Rota,  p.  62,  #4) 

Show that  any  second-order linear inhomogeneous equation that has both 
x2  and  sin2 x  as  solutions  must  have  a  singular  point  at  the  origin. 

4.  Describe  the  dominant  behavior  as  t → ∞  of  any  solution  u  to 

(D + 3)(D2  + 1)5 u = 640 cos t. 

Hint:  the  function 

solves  the  equation. 

U0 (t) =

(6 sin t − 2 cos t)
