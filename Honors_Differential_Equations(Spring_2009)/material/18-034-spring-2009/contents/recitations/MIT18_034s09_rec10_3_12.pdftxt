1.  Find  the  general  solution  to  the  following  equations  via  an  explicit  varia­

tion  of parameters procedure. 

′′ 
(a)  y  +  y  = 1 

′′ 
′
(b)  xy  −  y  = 1. 

(Hint:  In  the  ﬁrst  case,  consider  y  =  a(x) sin x  +  b(x) cos x  = 1,  in  the 

second,  y  =  a(x) + b(x)x2 .) 

2.  (Birkhoﬀ-Rota,  p.  62,  #3) 

Solve 

y  ′′  + 3y  ′  + 2y  =  x 3


for  the  initial  conditions  y  ′ (0) =  y (0) = 0.


3.  (Birkhoﬀ-Rota,  p.  62,  #5d) 

Construct  a  Green’s  function  for  the  initial-value  problem  associated  to 

the ODE 

x 2 u ′′ 

−  (x 2  + 2x)u ′  + (x  + 2)u  = 0.


Hint:  u(x) =  x  is  a  solution.


4.  (Birkhoﬀ-Rota,  p.  63,  #8)  Show  that,  if  q(t)  <  0,  the  Green’s  function 

′′ 
G(t, τ ) for the initial-value problem associated to  u  + q(t)u  = 0 is positive 

and  convex  upward  for  t > τ . 

5.  (Birkhoﬀ-Rota,  #5,  p.  82)

Show  that  every  linear  diﬀerential  operator  L  with  constant  real  coeﬃ­

cients  can  be  factored  as  L  =  AL1  ◦  L2  ◦  ·  · · ◦  Lm  where  A  ∈  R  and 
Li  =  Di  +  bi  or  Li  =  D2  +  piD +  qi .
