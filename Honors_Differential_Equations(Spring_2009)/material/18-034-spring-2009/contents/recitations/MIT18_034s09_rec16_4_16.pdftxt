1.  Suppose  A  is  an  n × n  matrix  and  y1 (t), y2 (t), . . . yn (t)  are  solutions  to 
y�  = Ay.  Show  that  the  set  if  {yi (t0 )}i
=1  is  linearly  independent  at  some 
n 
time  t0 ,  then  to  any  other  solution  y(t)  there  correspond  constants  ci 
so  that  y(t) =  c1y1 (t) + c2y2 (t) + . . . + cnyn (t)  (i.e.,  the  set  {yi (t)}n 
i=1 
constitutes  a  basis  of  solutions). 
2.  Let  A  be  an  n × n  matrix. 

(a)  Suppose v1  and v2  are  eigenvectors  of A  corresponding  to  the  eigen­
values  λ1  and  λ2 ,  respectively.  If  λ1  �=  λ2 ,  show  that  v1  and  v2  are 
linearly  independent. 
(b)  Assume  now  that	 n  =  2.  If  pA (λ) = (λ − λ1 )2 ,  show  that  either 
A = λ1 I ,  or  there  is  a  unique  eigenvector  v1  associated  to  λ1  and  a 
vector  v2  satisfying  (A − λ1 )v2  = v1 . 
(c)  For A as in the latter alternative in (2), show that the general solution 
to 

d 
dt 

is  given  by  y = eλ1 t (c1 t + c2 )v1  + c1 eλ1 tv2 .


y = Ay

3.  For  the  system 

� = 3y1  + 2y2 ,
y1

� = −2y1  − y2 , 
y2

ﬁnd  the  unique  fundamental matrix  U (t)  satisfying  U (0) = I . 
4.  Under  what  conditions  on  the  trace  and  determinant  of  the  2 × 2  matrix 
A  will  al l  solutions  to  the  equation  y�  = Ay  satisfy  limt→∞  |y(t)| = 0?
