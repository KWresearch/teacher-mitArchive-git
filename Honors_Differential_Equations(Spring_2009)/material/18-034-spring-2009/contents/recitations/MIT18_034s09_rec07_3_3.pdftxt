1.  Deﬁne an inner or  “dot”  product on  C [a, b] by 
 

b 

�
a 

hu, vi  = 

u(x)v(x) dx. 

(Thus h·,  ·i  is  a  positive  deﬁnite  symmetric  bilinear  form  on  C [a, b].)  Sup­

′ 
′′ 
pose  L[u] =  u  +  pu  +  qu  is  a  given  diﬀerential  operator,  and  M [u] is its 

adjoint.  Show  that  hL[u], vi  =  hu, M [v ]i  for  all  u,  v  ∈  C 2 [a, b] provided 

u(a) =  u(b) =  v(a) =  v(b) = 0. 

2.  Consider  the  equation  y  =  F (x, y ),  where  F  :  R2  →  R  is  a  continuous 
′ 

function  and  satisﬁes  the  (two-sided)  Lipschitz  condition  in  y 

|F (x, y2 ) − F (x, y1 )| ≤ C |y2  − y1 |. 

Prove that if u  and  v  are two solutions to the equation with  u(x0 ) =  v(x0 ), 

then  u  ≡  v 

3.  Suppose  w  is  a  solution  to  ecos xw ′′  − x2w  +  x3  =  0  with  w(0) = 0.  Let 

y  =  w  −  x  and  show  that  y  cannot  have  either  a  positive  maximum  or 

′′ 
negative  minimum.  Noting  that  w  has  the  sign  of  w  −  x,  sketch  the 

′
graphs  of  a  few  solution  curves  with  varying  values  of  w  (0). 

4.  (Birkhoﬀ-Rota, p.  57, #2) Reduce the following ODE  to self-adjoint form. 

′′ 
(a) (1 − x2 )u  − xu  +  λu  = 0.

(b)  x2 u ′′  +  xu  +  u  = 0.
