1.  Consider  the  problem  of  recovering  the  diﬀerential  operator	 T  =  p(D) 
from  knowledge  of  the  solution  y(t)  to  T y = 0  with  initial  conditions 

y(0) = 1,

· · · 
y � (0) = y �� (0) =  = y (n−1) (0) = 0.

(Since  p(D)  can  at  most  be  determined  up  to  a  multiplicative  constant, 
we  assume  p(D)  to  be  monic.) 
(a)  Check  that L[y (j ) ] = sj L[y ] − s(j−1)  for  j  = 1, 2, . . . , n,  and  conclude 
that  Y (s)  gives  no  information  about  P (s)  if  P (0) = 0  (except  that, 
in  fact,  P (0) = 0). 

P (s)  can  be  fully  determined  from 

(b)  Show  that  if  P (0) =  0,  however, 
Y (s). 
2.  Suppose A  : (a, b) → Mn  is  an n × n matrix  and  det A(t) = 0  for  all 
Compute  B � (t)  where  B (t) = A−1 (t). 

t ∈ I . 

3.  Take  the  second  order  equation  x��  + p(t)x�  + q(t)x =  0  and  change  it  to 
a  ﬁrst-order  system  v�  =  Av.  in  the  usual  way.  Show  that  the  Wron­
skian  of  two  solutions  x1 ,  x2  to  the  original  equation  is  the  same  as  the 
Wronskian oﬀ the two corresponding solutions x1 , x2  of the system.  Show 
that Abel’s  formula  for  the Wronskian of  two  (scalar)  solutions  to  the  sec­
ond  order  ODE  agrees  with  what  one  obtains  for  the  Wronskian  of  two 
linearly  independent  solutions  in  the  vector  formulation when  one  applies 
the  identity  (det Y (t))�  = det Y (t) tr Y �  for  an  smooth  invertible  family  of 
matrices  Y (t).
