1.  Logarithmic  spiral. 

2.  (Birkhoﬀ-Rota:  p.  6,  #6)  Show  that  the  functions  of  y  =  g (y ),  for  any 
′

continuous function  g (y ) are  either  all  increasing  or  decreasing  functions 

in  any  strip  yi−1  < y < yi  between  successive  zeros  yi  of  g . 

3.  (Birkhoﬀ-Rota: p.  11, #3) Find all  solutions of the ODE  xy ′ +(1−x)y = 0, 
then  do  the  same  for  the  equation  xy  + (1  −  x)y = 1. 
′
4.  (Birkhoﬀ-Rota:  p.  11,  #10)  Show  that  the  ellipses  5x2  + 6xy + 5y 2  =  C 

are  integral  curves  of  the  ODE 

(5x + 3y ) + (3x + 5y )y  = 0. 
′ 

What  are  its  solution  curves? 

5.  Solve  y  +  y cos x  =  cos x  ﬁrst  by  the  method  of  integrating  factors,  and 
′

then by  the  method  of  variation  of parameters. 

6.  Show  that  the  solution  of  2y ′′  = 3y 2  with  y (0) = 0 and  y ′  (0) = 1 is given 

implicitly by
