Problem  Set  4


We  would  like  to  distribute  our  favorite  solution  for  each  problem  to  the  class  as 
the  oﬃcial  solution  so  please  strive  for  clarity  and  elegance. 

Problem  4-1.  Welding  Speed 
(a)  Plot  welding  speed  as  a  function  of  weld  pool  depth  for  depths  s  =  1mm  to  25mm  at  two 
preheat  temperatures,  Tp  =  70F  and  Tp  =  700F.  Plot  the  two  curves  on  the  same  graph  [consider 
using  a  spreadsheet  to  do  this].  Show  any  formulas  that  you  derive. 
(b)  Explain  what  the  point  of  this  exercise  is,  ie.,  how  does  this  shape  how  you  design  a  part  and 
the  process  that  you  use  to  make  the  part  when welding  is  involved. 

Problem  4-2.  Cutting  model 
(a) Estimate the rate of production for the part in Figure 1 using the parameters from the following 
table.  You  may  assume  the  part  enters  the  cutting  process  as  a  rod  that  is  2.3  inches  long  at  a 
radius  of  1  inch.  Plot  the  amount  of  power  (in  hp)  required  during  the  cutting  of  turning  of  this 
part.

(b) What  is the tooling cost per part as a  function of ω?  [Note,  the velocity  changes during the two 
passes].  Use  a  spreadsheet  to  plot  the  tool  cost  vs  V c  for  values  from  350  rev/min  to  450  rev/min.
