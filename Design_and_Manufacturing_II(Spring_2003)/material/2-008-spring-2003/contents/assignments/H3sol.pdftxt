Problem  Set  3  Solutions 

Problem  1-1.  Thermoforming 
Consider  the  thermoformed  part  drawn  in  Figure  1  which  was  used  to  package  last  semester’s  hamburger 
yoyo.  This  part  was  unapologetically  diﬃcult  to  manufacture,  and  this  problem  will  investigate  some  of  its 
pitfalls. 

Figure  1:  Thermoformed  part 

(a)  Compute  the  part’s  draw  ratio.  Is  it  reasonable? 

The  draw  ratio  is  the  depth  over  the  width  =  2.420 
2.724  = 0.888  which  is  perfectly  reasonable. 
(b)  The  part  was  formed  from  a  sheet  of  clear  polystyrene  with  thickness  0.030  inches  and  dimensions  4 
inches by 4  inches square.  The part was vacuum-drawn with  a clamp  that enclosed an area of approximately 
3.5”  by  3.5”.  Assuming  that  the  drawn  part  has  uniform  thickness,  what  is  the  wall  thickness. 

First  we  need  to  approximate  the  surface  area  of  the  inside  of  the  part.  Kudos  go  to  Brian  Ruddy  who 
generated  a  solidworks  model  that  does  al l  the  hard  work.  His  model  reports  an  area  of  A  =  27.57  inches 2 . 
The  material  that  is  drawn  depends  on  the  geometry  of  the mold.  If  you  are  optimistic  and  assume  al l  of  the 
material  from  the  3.5  inches2  clamped  area  gets  drawn,  then  the  part  thickness  would  be 

3.52 
(0.030) 
27.57 

= 0.013in 

In  reality,  as  soon  as  the  lip  of  the  warm  plastic  touches  the  sides  of  the  mold  no  more  of  that  external 
area  gets  drawn  into  the  mold.  Therefore,  a  more  realistic  calculation  is  to  assume  that  drawing  area  is 
approximately  120  percent  of  the  diameters  of  the  part.

(c)  The  part  certainly  did  not  have  uniform  thickness.  Which  areas  of  the  part  would  you  expect  to  be  the 
thickest  and  why? 

= 0.009  in 

As  empirical ly  proven,  the  bottom  center  cup  and  the  very  top  of  the  part  were  the  thickest.  In  both  cases, 
this  represents  were  the  plastic  ﬁrst  touched  the  mold. 
(d)  Recall  that  the  formula  for  Euler  buckling  is 

Pcr  = π2E I /(kL2) 

where  E  is  the  modulus  of  elasticity,  I  is  the  moment  of  inertia  L  is  the  length,  and  k  is  a  factor  that  takes 
the  support  conditions  into  consideration.  Make  reasonable  assumptions  and  compute  the  buckling  load 
that  the  part  can  take.  Recall  that  I  =  4 π(r4  − ri 
1
4 )  for  a  tube  with  outside  and  inside  diameters  ro  and  ri
o 
respectively.  Also,  the  modulus  for  standard  polystyrene  is  3350N/mm2 .  Comment  on  the  appropriateness 
of  the  value  you  computed. 

First  we  compute  the  moment  of  Inertia: 
1 
I  =  π((2.724/2)4 
4 

Substituting  this  value,  we  have 

− (2.715/2)4) = 0.724 

Pcr  = π2 (3350/25.4)(0.724)/(2.420)2  = 160.8  N 

Which  sounds  fantastic,  but  unfortunately,  the  wal ls  are  not  uniform. 
(e) What  other  problems  does  the  part  have? 

In  this  original  drawing,  there  is  no  draft  angle,  and  the  outside  corners  do  not  have  any  radius. 

Problem  1-2.  Cutting  model 
(a)  Using  the  data  from  the  ﬁrst  experiment  in  Monday’s  lecture,  calculate  the  sheer  angle  φ  for  the 
experiment.  Show  your  calculations.  The  data  for  the  experiment  will  be  posted  on  the  website. 
We ﬁnd the shear  angle  from  the measured value of  t0 , tc , α and  the cosine  identity cos(a+ b) = cos(a) cos(b)− 
sin(a) sin(b): 

t0

Plugging  in  values  for  α = 10, t0  = 0.015, tc  = 0.0445  from  the  ﬁrst  experiment,  we  get  φ = 19.4◦  deg.  In  the 
last  experiment,  we  get  that  φ = 40◦  deg  which  is  quite  steep. 
(b)  What  is  the  chip  velocity  (Vc )  and  sheer  velocity  (Vs )  from  this  experiment?  Why  does  this  make 
intuitive  sense? 

Vc 
V

t0

. 
In  the  ﬁrst  experiment,  the  diameter  was  3  inches  and  the  spind le  was  set  at  96  RPM.  Therefore,  V  = 
π(3)(96) = 904  in/min  and  therefore  the  Vc  = 904(0.015/0.0445) = 304  in/min. 
The  shear  velocity  relationship  is 

=


Vs 
Vc

cos(α) 
sin(φ)

and  is  therefore  Vs  =  304 cos(10)  = 901.3.  This  makes  sense  since most  of  the  cutting  energy  is  spent  shearing
sin(19.4) 
the  material. 
(c) Using the variables Fc  and Ft  (which would normally be measured experimentally using a dynamometer), 
determine  the  shear  strength  (τs )  of  the  material  that  we  were  cutting. 
The  formal ly,  I  see,  is  quite  readily  presented  in  the  lecture  notes 

τs  = 

Fc cos(φ) − Ft  sin(φ)
(t0/ sin(φ))w 

(d)  Compute  the  power  of  the  machine.  Make  assumptions  about  the  motor  eﬃciency,  the  energy  lost  to 
friction,  noise,  heat,  and  vibrations. 
This  is  meant  to  be  a  rough  estimate.  The  speciﬁc  cutting  energy  of  4140  is  3.35J/mm3 .  When  the  machine 
stal led,  the  spind le  was  540rpm,  and  t0  = 0.027.  Therefore,  the  material  removal  rate  was  M RR  =  (540 ∗ 
π ∗ 3) ∗ 0.027 ∗ 0.075 = 10.3008  in3/min.  Since  the  machine  stal led,  the  power  of  the  machine  had  to  be  less 
than  P  = mrr ∗ µc  = 10.3 ∗ 3.335 ∗ 25.43  ≤ 562, 900J/min ≤ 9400W < 12.6Hp  which  is  reasonable. 
(d)  Based  on  the  drawing  on  page  15  of  the  Cutting  notes  (L6),  I  argue  that  the  chip  thickness  tc  is  the 
same  dimension  as  the  length  of  the  shear  plane.  This  would  imply  that  tc  =  t0/ sin(φ)  which  contradicts 
the  equations  from  page  12.  Explain  what  is  wrong. 
The  chip  is  not  necessarily  perpendicular  to  the  shear  zone.  This  is  only  the  case  when  the  friction  angle  β 
is  zero. 

Problem  1-3.  Process  choice 
Describe  how  you would make  a  decision  on  whether  to  use  thermoforming  or  injection  molding  for  a  part. 
What  is  the  diﬀerence  between  amorphous  and  crystalline  plastics,  and  which  ones  are  better  for  thermo­
forming? 
Brian  Ruddy  provided  this  crips  answer: 

Crystal line  plastics  exhibit  strong polymer  chain  alignment;  amorphous  plastics  have  no  alignment. 
This  diﬀerence  makes  crystal line  plastics  stronger  but  more  brittle  than  amorphous  ones.  For 
thermoforming,  amorphous  plastics  ar  e  preferred  because  at  higher  temperatures,  there  strength 
and  stiﬀness  are  red  uced,  therefore  making  it  easier  to  form  the  part.
