Problem  Set  1 

We  would  like  to  distribute  our  favorite  solution  for  each  problem  to  the  class  as  the  oﬃcial 
solution  so  please  strive  for  clarity  and  elegance.  If  you  would  like  to  type  your  problem  set,  the 
raw  LATEX  version  of  this  problem  set  is  available  on  the  2.008 Web  site. 

Problem  1-1.  Describe  a  machine 
Use  detailed  sketches  to  describe  the  geometry  and  purpose  of  a  machine  that  you  have  designed. 
You  need  only  sketch  the  important  components  (i.e.  individual  screws  can  be  omitted).  The 
grader  should  be  able  to  read  your  drawing  within  2  minutes. 

Problem  1-2.  Non-production  design  and  manufacturing 
Pick  a  critical  component  of  the  machine/product  from  above  (one  that  will  not  disappear  in 
problem  3)  and  provide  the  process  plan  that  you  used  to  make  the  part.  Pick  a  component  that 
requires  at  least  three  diﬀerent  types  of  features  (3  bolt  holes  are  not  diﬀerent  types  of  features). 
Provide sketches for each stage of manufacturing and include a description of the speciﬁc machining 
task,  how  the  part  is  to  be  ﬁxtured  and  which  tools  are  used. 

Problem  1-3.  DFMA  and  process  planning 
Suppose  you  need  to  make  100000  of  your  machines  per  year.  Describe  how  and  why  you  would 
change  the design.  Consider  the new design  of  the part  you described  in problem  2.  Provide  a new 
process  plan  for  this  part,  including  sketches.  Brieﬂy  explain  how  the  new  process  bears  on  cost, 
rate,  quality  and  ﬂexibility. 
Some  questions  to  consider  and/or  address:  How  much  factory  space  do  you  need  to  make  your 
part?  How  much  skilled  labor  is  required?
