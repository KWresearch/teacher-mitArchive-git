Problem  4-1.  Welding  Speed 
(a)  Plot  welding  speed  as  a  function  of  weld  pool  depth  for  depths  s  =  1mm  to  25mm  at  two 
preheat  temperatures,  Tp  =  70F  and  Tp  =  700F.  Plot  the  two  curves  on  the  same  graph  [consider 
using  a  spreadsheet  to  do  this].  Show  any  formulas  that  you  derive. 
In order  to graph  the weld-pool depth versus the welding velocity, V , we use the fol lowing relationship 

Vw  ≥

Choosing  1020  steel  as  the  material  and  a  weld  tip  with  diameter  2mm,  the  constants  are  α  = 
14.1  mm2/s  and  Ji  = .448 Tm −Ti .  First  we  change  the  Fahrenheit  temperatures  to  Celcius:  70  F = 
◦
hf s 
21.2◦ C and 700◦ F = 371.1◦ C.  Then J1  = (.448) 1500−21.2  = 2.682 and J2  = (.448) 1500−371.1  = 2.047.

(b)  Explain  what  the  point  of  this  exercise  is,  ie.,  how  does  this  shape  how  you  design  a  part  and 
the  process  that  you  use  to  make  the  part  when welding  is  involved. 
At  pool  depths  less  than  4mm,  interaction  speed  is  quite  sensitive  to  the  pool  depth.  Therefore, 
welding  thin  sheets  wil l  require  attention  to  process.  This  equation  is  used  as  one  lower  bound  on 
the  welding  speed.  Heat  interaction  is  another  consideration. 

Problem  4-2.  Cutting  model 
(a) Estimate the rate of production for the part in Figure 1 using the parameters from the following 
table.  You  may  assume  the  part  enters  the  cutting  process  as  a  rod  that  is  2.3  inches  long  at  a 
radius  of  1  inch.  Plot  the  amount  of  power  (in  hp)  required  during  the  turning  of  this  part.

Four  passes  wil l  be  required,  since  each  pass  removes  0.100  radial ly.  Since  each  pass  is  two  inches 
long, each pass requires 2/.020 = 100 revolutions of the lathe, and at 400rev/min,  each pass  therefore 
requires  15  seconds. 
The  part  therefore  requires  1  minute,  so  the  rate  of  production  is  1/min. 
Power  is  equal  to  speciﬁc  cutting  energy  times  the  material  removal  rate.  In  order  to  estimate  the 
energy  lost  to  other  factors,  I  am  multiplying  the  speciﬁc  energies  by  a  factor  of  1.05.  Therefore, 
we  have

(b) What  is the tooling cost per part as a  function of ω?  [Note,  the velocity  changes during the two 
passes].  Use  a  spreadsheet  to  plot  the  tool  cost  vs  V c  for  values  from  350  rev/min  to  450  rev/min.

Figure  3:  Turned  Flange 

The way that this problem is currently stated makes it real ly quite diﬃcult.  The Taylor equation gives 
tool  life  for  a  speciﬁc  speed.  However,  by  ﬁxing ω ,  the  speed  changes  throughout  the  turning  process, 
and  so  the  rate  of  wear  changes.  One  compromise  (approximation)  might  be  to  take  the  geometric

mean  of  the  diﬀerent  speeds.  The  geometric  mean  of  the  radii  are 
�
therefore,  the  corresponding  speed  would  be  2π ∗ 0.8425 ∗ ω .  As ω  varies  from  350  to  450  rev/minute, 
v  ) 1/n 
the  tool  life  is  computed  by  tlife = ( C 
and  this  is  shown  below:

Figure  4:  Tool  life. 

Recal l  from  above  that  each  part  requires  approximately  400  revolutions  to  produce.  Therefore,  at 
each  speed,  the  part  takes  tmake = 400/ω  minutes  to  produce.  The  number  of  tools  needed  per  part 
is  therefore  tmake/tlife  and  since  each  tool  costs  20  dol lars,  the  tooling  cost  is  simply  that  ﬁgure 
times  twenty.  The  tooling  cost  is  plotted  below:

Figure 5: Tooling cost! Expensive part!

Since this computation does not take into consideration the cost of changing tools, it appears that
running faster is cheaper since the amount of time saved in making the part by using a higher
spind le speed overwhelms the extra cost of reducing tool life– the tool constants are such that the
tool life degrades very slow ly.
