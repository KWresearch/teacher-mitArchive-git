Problem  6-1.  Forming

(a)  Name  some  process  parameters  of  a metal  forming  operation.

(b)  Recall  the  equation  on  page  11  of  the  forging  notes  for  Fz  :

2µR  − 1 � 
� 
� 
h  �2 
Y e  h  − 
2µR 
Fz  = (πR2 )(1/2) 
µR 
h 
What  does  the  Y  represent  in  this  equation?  What  is  the  only  process  parameter  that  you  can 
really  change  in  this  equation? 
Lets  consider  an  even more  back-of-the-envelope  version  of  this. 
(c)  Note  that  for  0 < x ≤ 1.75,  ex  ≤ 1 + x + x2 .  Convince  me  of  this. 
(d)  Assume  that  2µR  ≤  1.75.  Simplify  the  expression  for  Fz  for  this  range.  Within  this  range,
h 
what  are  the  only  two  parameters  left?  Is  this  a  realistic  range  for  µ, R, h?


Problem  6-2.  Springback

(a)  Recall  the  equation  for  springback  given  on  page  22  of  the  lecture  notes. 

Ri  Y  �3  − 3 
Ri  = 4 � 
� 
� 
Ri  Y  + 1 
t E 
t E 
Rf 
In  this  problem,  we  will  explore  whether  it  is  possible  for  there  to  be  zero  springback  based  on 
these  equations. 
Find  a  solution  to  the  equation  4x3  − 3x = 0. 
(c) Look up a  few diﬀerent values  for Y /E  for some exotic materials of your choosing (for example, 
balsa  wood).  Now  for  reasonable  values  of  t  (think  about  where  you  would  be  using  these  exotic 
materials),  and  using  your  solution  from  part  (b),  plot  the  Ri  for  which  bending  to  this  radius 
would  produce  no  springback.  Are  these  values  realistic? 
(d)  Explain  what  happens  when  you  increase  the  thickness  of  the  wire  that  you  are  bending  by 
say,  10  percent.
