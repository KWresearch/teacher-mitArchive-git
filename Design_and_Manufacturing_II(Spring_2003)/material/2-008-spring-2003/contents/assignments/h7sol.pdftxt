Problem Set 7

Problem 7-1. Systems

(a) Explain what happens to inventory as cycle time decreases.

Solution: Recall that Little’s law states that L = ‚w where L is the average inventory, ‚
is the average production rate and w is the cycle time. Therefore, as cycle time decreases,
the average inventory should also decrease.

(b) Describe your process of doing laundry. How many operations, what are the respective pro-
duction rates, do you have any buﬁers, what is the cycle time?

I curse the laundry at a rate of 106
Solution: The laundry piles up into big loads.
utterances per minute. I then vacuum seal the laundry into a container at a rate of 1
pound per second, and then deliver it to a service (3 minutes) down the street, and then
pay a ﬂxed rate per pound to have it done. The cycle time is 24 hours.

Problem 7-2. Boston Weather

(a) The average daily temperature for Boston in May is 58:5–F . Suppose the standard deviation
is 8:157–F and assume the temperature obeys a normal distribution. How many days in May are
less than 43–F ? (This is a bad analogy since we are making assumptions that are totally bogus.
Just be sure that you can do simple calculations with normal distributions for the exam.)

Solution: We would like to know the number of days that fall (58:5 ¡ 43)=8:157 = 1:9
standard deviations outside of the mean in one direction (ie, we dont care about the days
that are 58:5 + (1:9 ⁄ 8:157) degrees). Looking at our table, we see that for z = 1:9, the
area under the normal distribution curve is 0:9713. Therefore (1 ¡ 0:9713)31 = 0:88 days
in May are below 43–F.

(b) As a condition of coming to MIT for graduate school, I sent MIT my speciﬂcations for the
temperature range during the month of May (MIT controls everything, dont they?) In particular,
I agreed to a daily temperature of 62–F but would tolerate plus or minus 5 degree shifts. Based on
the data from (a), what is MIT’s capability index (Cpk )?

Solution: This involves plugging into the formulas for Cpk :

Zmin =

j(62 ¡ 5) ¡ 58:5j
8:157
(62 + 5) ¡ 58:5
8:157
Cpk = Zmin=3 = 0:04

= ¡0:123

Problem 7-3. Shaft

(a) Your enterprise is using a process which produces parts whose length have a mean 2:5in and
standard deviation 0:015in. You plan to make 100,000 of these parts. You have determined by
taking into account the rework cost and the loss of customer satisfaction that the quality loss
function for the process is:

L = 2250(cid:190) 2

where (cid:190) is the standard deviation of length of the part and L is the average quality lost in dollars
per part.

A very smart but somewhat expensive Harvard graduate has oﬁered you her expert advice on your
process. For every 0:001in reduction in the standard deviation of the length of the part, she will
charge 6000.

How much of her advice do you buy? (You can buy fractional amounts of her consulting).

Solution: Let L(x) represent quality lost as a function of the amount of advice that you
buy. We can easily express L(x) and then minimize it by taking the ﬂrst derivative and
setting it to zero.

L(x) = (105 )2250(0:015 ¡ 0:001x)2 + 6000x
= 225x2 ¡ 750x + 50625
L0 (x) = 450x ¡ 750
Setting this to zero, we get that
x⁄ = 1:66

It pays to buy 1:66 units of consulting.
