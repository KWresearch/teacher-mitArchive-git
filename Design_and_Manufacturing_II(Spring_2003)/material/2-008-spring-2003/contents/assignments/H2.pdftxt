Problem  Set  2 

We  would  like  to  distribute  our  favorite  solution  for  each  problem  to  the  class  as  the  oﬃcial 
solution  so  please  strive  for  clarity  and  elegance.  If  you  would  like  to  type  your  problem  set,  the 
raw  LATEX  version  of  this  problem  set  is  available  on  the  2.008 Web  site. 

Problem  1-1.  Injection  Molding 
The  gate  and  runner  system  that  you  use  to  move  plastic  into  an  injection  molding  cavity  are 
critical  design  parameters.  Suppose  the  polymer  material  that  you  are  using  has  a  viscosity  µ  of 
950N s/m2  under  your  processing  conditions.  Suppose  your  initial  gate  and  round  runner  system 
is  3.5  mm  in  diameter  and  approximately  25  mm  long.  Your  part  has  a  volume  of  approximately 
20000  mm3  and  a  pro jected  area  of  approximately  1800  mm2 .  Your  Engel  machine  claims  that 
it  can  melt  and  deliver  material  at  a  rate  of  165  cm 3 /sec.  Assume  that  there  is  no  pressure  loss 
bewteen the mold cavity and the runner system, and none of the clamping force  is lost  in deforming 
the  molds  when  they  come  together. 
(a) What  is  shortest  injection  time  for  the  part? 
(b)  Recall  that  the  equation  for  Newtonian  ﬂow  through  a  round  channel  is: 

Q = 

πP r4 
8µL 

where  Q  is  the  ﬂow  (m3/s),  P  is  the  pressure  change  (Pa),  r  is  the  radius  of  the  channel  (m),  µ  is 
viscosity  (N s/m2 ),  and  L  is  the  length  of  the  channel  (m). 
What  is  the  pressure  required  to  inject  your  part  if  you  use  the  smallest  injection  time? 
(c)  What  happens  if  you  change  the  injection  time  to  1  second  instead?  What  is  the  pressure 
required?  What  is  the  required  clamping  force?  What  happens  to  the  clamping  force  if  you  make 
your  channel  radius  10  percent  larger? 
(d)  Why  is  it  ok  to  increase  the  injection  time  to  1  second?  What  prevents  you  from  using  a  10 
second  injection  time?  What  are  the  disadvantages  of making  a  10mm  radius  runner  channel? 

Problem  1-2.  Geometry 
The  top  part  in  Figure  1  is  used  as  the  battery  cover  in  a  cellphone.  How  would  you  modify  the 
design  to  make  it  easier  to  manufacture? 
Plastic bottle caps [the kind that screw on to a bottle] illustrate one ma jor injection molding hurdle. 
What  is  it?  How  can  you  get  around  it? 

Problem  1-3.  The  elements  What  happens  to  a  plastic  part  that  is  left  outside  in  the  sun  for 
several years?  The absorption spectrum for carbon black is presented below (Figure 2).  Why might 
you  want  to  add  carbon  black  to  a  plastic  part  that  is  meant  for  outdoor  use?
