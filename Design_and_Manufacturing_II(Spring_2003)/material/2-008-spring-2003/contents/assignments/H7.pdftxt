Problem  Set  7 

Problem  7-1.  Systems 
(a)  Explain  what  happens  to  inventory  as  cycle  time  decreases. 
(b)  Describe  your  process  of  doing  laundry.  How  many  operations,  what  are  the  respective  pro­
duction  rates,  do  you  have  any  buﬀers,  what  is  the  cycle  time? 

Problem  7-2.  Boston  Weather 
(a)  The  average  daily  temperature  for  Boston  in  May  is  58.5◦
F .  Suppose  the  standard  deviation 
is  8.157◦
F  and  assume  the  temperature  obeys  a  normal  distribution.  How  many  days  in  May  are 
less  than  43◦
F  ?  (This  is  a  bad  analogy  since  we  are  making  assumptions  that  are  totally  bogus. 
Just  be  sure  that  you  can  do  simple  calculations  with  normal  distributions  for  the  exam.) 
(b)  As  a  condition  of  coming  to  MIT  for  graduate  school,  I  sent  MIT  my  speciﬁcations  for  the 
temperature  range  during  the  month  of May  (MIT  controls  everything,  dont  they?)  In  particular, 
I  agreed  to  a daily  temperature  of  62◦
F  but would  tolerate plus  or minus  5 degree  shifts.  Based  on 
the  data  from  (a),  what  is MIT’s  capability  index  (C pk)? 

Problem  7-3.  Shaft 
(a)  Your  enterprise  is  using  a  process  which  produces  parts  whose  length  have  a  mean  2.5in  and 
standard  deviation  0.015in.  You  plan  to  make  100,000  of  these  parts.  You  have  determined  by 
taking  into  account  the  rework  cost  and  the  loss  of  customer  satisfaction  that  the  quality  loss 
function  for  the  process  is: 

L = 2250σ2 

where  σ  is  the  standard  deviation  of  length  of  the  part  and  L  is  the  average  quality  lost  in  dollars 
per  part. 
A very  smart but  somewhat  expensive Harvard  graduate has  oﬀered you her  expert  advice  on your 
process.  For  every  0.001in  reduction  in  the  standard  deviation  of  the  length  of  the  part,  she  will 
charge  6000. 
How  much  of  her  advice  do  you  buy?  (You  can  buy  fractional  amounts  of  her  consulting).
