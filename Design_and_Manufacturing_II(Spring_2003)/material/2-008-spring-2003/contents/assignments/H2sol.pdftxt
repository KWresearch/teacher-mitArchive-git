Problem  1-1.  Injection  Molding 
The  gate  and  runner  system  that  you  use  to  move  plastic  into  an  injection  molding  cavity  are 
critical  design  parameters.  Suppose  the  polymer  material  that  you  are  using  has  a  viscosity  µ  of 
950N s/m2  under  your  processing  conditions.  Suppose  your  initial  gate  and  round  runner  system 
is  3.5  mm  in  diameter  and  approximately  25  mm  long.  Your  part  has  a  volume  of  approximately 
20000  mm3  and  a  pro jected  area  of  approximately  1800  mm2 .  Your  Engel  machine  claims  that 
it  can  melt  and  deliver  material  at  a  rate  of  165  cm 3 /sec.  Assume  that  there  is  no  pressure  loss 
bewteen the mold cavity and the runner system, and none of the clamping force  is lost  in deforming 
the  molds  when  they  come  together. 
(a) What  is  shortest  injection  time  for  the  part? 
The  injection  time  is  bounded  by  the  delivery  rate  of  the  Engels  machine.  The  shortest  time  is 
20000  = 0.121  seconds.
therefore 
160∗1000 
(b)  Recall  that  the  equation  for  Newtonian  ﬂow  through  a  round  channel  is: 

Q = 

πP r4 
8µL 

where  Q  is  the  ﬂow  (m3/s),  P  is  the  pressure  change  (Pa),  r  is  the  radius  of  the  channel  (m),  µ  is 
viscosity  (N s/m2 ),  and  L  is  the  length  of  the  channel  (m). 
What  is  the  pressure  required  to  inject  your  part  if  you  use  the  smallest  injection  time? 
Using  the  smal lest  injection  time,  the  ﬂow  would  have  to  be  0.000165m 3 /s.  Therefore,  the  pressue 
would  be  P  =  0.000165∗8∗950∗0.025  = 1.064 ∗ 109Pa =  154346  psi  .  This  is  not  a  reasonable  pressure 
π(0.001754 ) 
for  any  standard  machine. 
(c)  What  happens  if  you  change  the  injection  time  to  1  second  instead?  What  is  the  pressure 
required?  What  is  the  required  clamping  force?  What  happens  to  the  clamping  force  if  you  make 
your  channel  radius  10  percent  larger? 
If  we  change  the  injection  time  to  1  second,  the  ﬂow  rate  would  be  Q = 2 ∗ 10−5m3/s.  Therefore, 
2∗10−5 ∗8∗950∗0.025  = 1.28 ∗ 108  Pa  =  18708  psi  which  is  more 
the  required  pressure  would  be  P  = 
π(0.001754 ) 
reasonable.  The  clamping  force would  be 18708 ∗ 1800/(25.4) 2  = 26.09tons  which  is  quite reasonable. 
Making  the  radius  10  percent  larger  essential ly  decreases  the  pressure  by  a  factor  of  1.1 4  = 1.464. 
Therefore,  the  new  clamping  force  would  be  17.81  tons. 
(d)  Why  is  it  ok  to  increase  the  injection  time  to  1  second?  What  prevents  you  from  using  a  10 
second  injection  time?  What  are  the  disadvantages  of making  a  10mm  radius  runner  channel? 
Increasing  the  injection  time  by  less  than  one  second  is  ok  since  it  is  the  cooling  time  for  this  part 
which  dominates  the  cycle  time.  In  addition,  it  makes  it  feasible  to  produce  this  part  under  normal

pressures.  If  the  injection  time  is  10  seconds,  the  plastic  in  the  runner  channels  would  begin  to 
harden  before  al l  of  the  plastic  is  injected  into  the  mold.  The  parts  would  become  short  shots. 
Using  a  10  mm  radius  runner  channel  results  in  a  cycle  time  for  the  part  that  is  dominated  by 
the  time  it  takes  for  the  20mm  of  plastic  in  the  runners  to  cool.  The  runner  and  gate  plastic  must 
harden  before  the  clamps  can  open  because  the  gates are  actual ly  broken  oﬀ at  this  point.  The  actual 
ammount  of  extra  plastic  used  in  the  runner  is  not  an  issue  because  it  can  be  recycled  and  plastic 
is  quite  cheap. 

Problem  1-2.  Geometry

Figure  1:  Geometry  problem 

The  top  part  in  Figure  1  is  used  as  the  battery  cover  in  a  cellphone.  How  would  you  modify  the 
design  to  make  it  easier  to  manufacture? 
Add  a  radius  to  each  corner;  make  the  part  uniform  thickness,  remove  the  undercuts. 
Plastic bottle caps [the kind that screw on to a bottle] illustrate one ma jor injection molding hurdle. 
What  is  it?  How  can  you  get  around  it? 
The  threads  on  the  bottle  cap  are  al l  undercuts.  After  the  plastic  hardens,  it  holds  the  cap  on.  The 
problem  is  removing  the  cap  from  the  mold.  It  can  be  screwed  oﬀ,  which  is  time  consuming,  or  it 
can  be  popped  oﬀ  before  the  plastic  in  the  threads  ful ly  hardens. 

Problem  1-3.  The  elements  What  happens  to  a  plastic  part  that  is  left  outside  in  the  sun  for 
several years?  The absorption spectrum for carbon black is presented below (Figure 2).  Why might 
you  want  to  add  carbon  black  to  a  plastic  part  that  is  meant  for  outdoor  use? 
The  UV  in  sunlight  degrades  the  polymer,  and  the  plastic  becomes  dry  and  brittle.  Carbon  black 
can  be  added  to  the  plastic  in  order  to  help  absorb  most  of  the  harmful  UV  light.  It  wil l  however, 
also  increase  the  temperature  of  the  part  [which  is  bad  for  the  plastic  used  in  the  interior  of  your 
Jeep].
