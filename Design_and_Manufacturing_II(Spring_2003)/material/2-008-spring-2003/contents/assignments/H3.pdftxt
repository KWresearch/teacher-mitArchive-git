Problem Set 3

We would like to distribute our favorite solution for each problem to the class as the oﬃcial
solution so please strive for clarity and elegance.

Problem 1-1. Thermoforming
Consider the thermoformed part drawn in Figure 1 which was used to package last semester’s
hamburger yoyo. This part was unapologetically diﬃcult to manufacture, and this problem will
investigate some of its pitfalls.

Figure 1: Thermoformed part

(a) Compute the part’s draw ratio. Is it reasonable?
(b) The part was formed from a sheet of clear polystyrene with thickness 0.030 inches and dimen-
sions 4 inches by 4 inches square. The part was vacuum-drawn with a clamp that enclosed an area
of approximately 3.5” by 3.5”. Assuming that the drawn part has uniform thickness, what is the
wall thickness.
(c) The part certainly did not have uniform thickness. Which areas of the part would you expect
to be the thickest and why?
(d) Recall that the formula for Euler buckling is

Pcr = π2E I /(kL2 )

XYinchwhere E is the modulus of elasticity, I is the moment of inertia L is the length, and k is a factor
that takes the support conditions into consideration. Make reasonable assumptions and compute
o − r4
the buckling load that the part can take. Recall that I = 1
4 π(r4
i ) for a tube with outside and
inside diameters ro and ri respectively. Also, the modulus for standard polystyrene is 3350N/mm2 .
Comment on the appropriateness of the value you computed.
(e) What other problems does the part have?

Problem 1-2. Cutting model
(a) Using the data from the ﬁrst experiment in Monday’s lecture, calculate the sheer angle φ for the
experiment. Show your calculations. The data for the experiment will be posted on the website.
(b) What is the chip velocity (Vc ) and sheer velocity (Vs ) from this experiment? Why does this
make intuitive sense?
(c) Using the variables Fc and Ft (which would normally be measured experimentally using a
dynamometer), determine the sheer strength (ρs ) of the material that we were cutting.
(d) Compute the power of the machine. Make assumptions about the motor eﬃciency, the energy
lost to friction, noise, heat, and vibrations.
(d) Based on the drawing on page 15 of the Cutting notes (L6), I argue that the chip thickness
tc is the same dimension as the length of the shear plane. This would imply that tc = t0/ sin(φ)
which contradicts the equations from page 12. Explain what is wrong.

Problem 1-3. Process choice
Describe how you would make a decision on whether to use thermoforming or injection molding for
a part.
What is the diﬀerence between amorphous and crystalline plastics, and which ones are better for
thermoforming?
