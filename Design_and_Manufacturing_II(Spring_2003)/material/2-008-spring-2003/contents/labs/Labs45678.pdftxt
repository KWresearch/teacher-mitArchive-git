OBJECTIVE 
This exercise requires student teams to design and manufacture a three-part, or four-part yo-yo. 
The goal is to follow a typical product design/manufacturing sequence. The steps include: 

1)  Designing a product to be manufactured, 
2)  Designing the tooling to be used to form the parts for the product, 
3)  Machining the tooling with computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools, 
4)  Optimizing (tuning) the manufacturing processes, 
5)  Manufacturing a batch of product, and 
6)  Characterizing the manufactured products. 

These exercises provide an opportunity to apply what you have learned about CAD/CAM, to learn about commonly used 
manufacturing processes, and to recognize some issues concerning the optimization of a manufacturing process. One of the 
lessons that can be learned by going through this progression is that the process and the tooling impose limitations on the part 
design. As an example, whether the part is thermoformed or injection molded, it must be easily removable from the forming 
tool.  Thus, we will see that for best results the product and the process (in this case the tooling) must be considered 
simultaneously. 
INTRODUCTION 
Forming processes are used to produce a tremendous variety and quantity of parts.  Examples of forming processes for metal 
include casting and sheet metal forming.  Two forming processes for polymeric materials, injection molding and 
thermoforming, will be the focus of this laboratory sequence.  The lessons learned from examining injection molding and 
thermoforming will be applicable not only to plastic materials, but to metals and ceramics as well. 

All forming processes have one essential ingredient in common.  They all rely on a tool, die, or mold to create the geometry 
of the finished part.  In general, each new part design demands the creation of a new tool or die.  This situation contrasts 
greatly with machining, where a set of cutting tools can be used to create a wide variety of finished shapes.  Thus, we see that 
forming processes are less flexible to design changes than machining processes.  However, forming processes result in net 
shape or near net shape parts.  Thus, the use of forming processes is a balance between the cost and time associated with 
creating the tool or die and lower cost per part when making a large number of parts. 
ORGANIZATION 
Since the project will take several weeks to complete, we have broken the exercise into small segments: Labs IV, V, VI, VII, 
and VIII. During these labs students are organized into groups. Each group will design its product together and should 
delegate responsibility to specific individuals/teams for the manufacture of each of the component parts you intend to 
produce. 
Lab IV: PRODUCT DESIGN 
Each yo-yo group will design a yo-yo that has two, or three injection molded parts, and one, or two thermoformed parts. The 

designs, which you submit, are required to specify the increment of interference that you intend, and the dimensional  

tolerance that you anticipate will provide adequate service.  

A background article on yo-yo physics, and an example ‘exploded assembly drawing’ of a yo-yo can be found in the ‘Lab

Handouts’ folder in the course locker.  Mold blank dimensions, in ‘Mill Injection Molding Blanks’, and ‘Lathe Injection  

Molding Blanks’ folders.  Prints of the ‘Punch, and Die Set’ blanks, as well as a ‘Thermoform Mold Blank’ are in their 

respective folders.


The design requirements:


• 

• 

Yo-Yos should be made of 2-3 injection-molded parts that snap fit together, and at least 1 thermoformed part 

A set of ejector pins can be used if the injection-molded parts are not easily removable from the two-piece molds

• 

• 

• 

• 

Each injection-molded part cannot exceed 2.7 cubic inches in volume 

The maximum outside diameter of the injection-molded parts cannot exceed 2.5” in diameter 

High impact polystyrene ‘HIPS’ sheet of .020”, .030”, and .040” thickness is provided for thermoformed parts 

Polypropylene is provided for the injection-molded parts, various colors are available 

• 

Appropriate spec ranges (tolerances) must be specified for the dimensional features of each part 
Lab V: TOOLING DESIGN 
Team members will design the molds needed to produce the required parts and use Mastercam to generate “G” code to direct 
the motion of the machine tools to produce these molds.  Team members must confer with teammates to reach agreement on 
common dimensions and intended interferences to ensure snap-fits.  All molds will be machined from aluminum.  Ejector 
pins can be used if the design warrants the need for them.  Team members responsible for the thermoformed part will 
machine their designed shape into a mold blank measuring 3.0” in diameter X .625” thick.  They will also have an option to 
design, and machine a punch-and-die set for trimming the finished part from the material.  The punch-and-die set will be 
made from low carbon steel.  Prints for all the blanks, including the punch-and-die blanks are posted in the course locker, as 
well as a print showing the location and size of the ejector pin holes for the injection-molding blanks. 

Be sure, when importing your design to the mold blank templates, that you locate the center of the product in the center of the 
blanks. 
Lab VI: TOOLING FABRICATION 
Students will machine their molds using the CNC machine tools in the laboratory. 
Lab VII: PARTS PRODUCTION 
Students will use the injection molding and the thermoforming machine to produce enough parts for fifty assembled products. 
Students are expected to optimize the process for the desired quality features and to become proficient in the operation of the 
injection molding and thermoforming machines before beginning the production run.  Student teams will divide 
responsibilities to permit molding, trimming and sequence numbering for the creation of a run chart.  During the production, 
at about fifty pieces, a process parameter (e.g. cooling time, or sheet thickness) is to be altered to simulate a process 
disturbance to induce a mean shift of a part feature dimension. 
Lab VIII: PRODUCT INSPECTION 
Injection molded parts should be allowed to cool for a minimum of 30 minutes before measuring.  Select one dimension on 
each injection molded part and one dimension on each thermoformed part to study the dimensional variation in 
manufacturing.  Preferably the critical feature dimensions involved with the snap-fit aspect of the design. 
DELIVERABLES 
You are required to submit 4 reports as indicated below during the Discrete Parts Manufacturing progression.  A statement 
should accompany each report attributing authorship, by section, to an individual student, and a joint evaluation of the 
relative contribution of each group/team member to the entire Discrete Parts Manufacturing exercise.  Each group/team 
member must sign this statement.  Your statement should appear as: 

Student A 
Student B 

20%
15%

 
 

Student C 
Student D 

25%
10% 

 

Student E  30% 

Do not forget to include the agenda and minutes for each meeting. 

Each report should contain the following:
