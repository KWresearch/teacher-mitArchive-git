***** Course Information *****
Manufacturing is how we satisfy human need and create wealth. The challenge is
to create a product that is responsive to the customer with high quality and
low cost. A graduate of 2.008 should have the tools and confidence to go into a
manufacturing enterprise that is using an unfamiliar process to make a product
he/she has not seen, and yet be able to make intelligent decisions.
***** Scope *****
2.008 introduces you to modern manufacturing with four areas of emphasis:
manufacturing processes, equipment/control, systems, and design for
manufacturing. The course exposes you to integration of engineering and
management disciplines for determining manufacturing rate, cost, quality and
flexibility. Topics include process physics, equipment design and automation/
control, quality, design for manufacturing, industrial management, and systems
design and operation. Labs are integral parts of the course, and expose you to
various manufacturing disciplines and practices.
***** Objectives *****
    * Internalize the attributes along which the success or failure of a
      manufacturing process, machine, or system will be measured: quality,
      cost, rate, and flexibility.
    * Provide exposure to a range of current industrial processes and practices
      used to manufacture products in high and low volumes. Focus in depth on a
      few selected processes.
    * Apply physics to understand the factors that control the rate of
      production and influence the quality, cost and flexibility of processes.
    * Understand the impact of manufacturing constraints on product design and
      process planning.
    * Apply an understanding of variation to the factors that control the
      production rate and influence the quality, cost and flexibility of
      processes and systems.
    * Understand the role of control in processes and systems, especially in
      view of the presence of noise (variation).
    * Provide exposure to a range of manufacturing system constraints.
***** Credit and Workload *****
2.008 is a 12-unit subject. Each week, on the average, the course requires 3
hours of lecture, 5 hours of laboratory, group meetings and preparation for the
laboratory, and 4 hours of study, homework, and report writing. Six units may
be applied to the General Institute Lab Requirement.
***** Lectures *****
    * Lectures are held twice weekly for 90 minutes per session.
    * Lecture schedule: Refer to the Lecture and Lab Schedule.
    * Textbook: Kalpakjian, S. Manufacturing Engineering and Technology. 4th
      ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2001. The 4th edition is on
      reserve at Barker Engineering.
    * If you do not arrive on time, please enter the classroom from the third
      floor.
***** Laboratories *****
    * Lab safety: 'Safety First.' Please read the Safety Policy and abide by
      the safety rules for your sake. If not, you may not be allowed into the
      lab.
    * Lab sections are for four days a week, 3 hours per session.
    * Section selection: You will be assigned to one of the lab sections during
      the first lecture.
      Because each section can accommodate only 12 students, some of you may be
      asked to move to another section. Every effort will be made to enroll you
      in a convenient section, but seniors will have priority.
    * Lab attendance: Absolutely mandatory.
    * Lab schedule: Refer to the Lecture and Lab Schedule.
***** Grading Policy *****
    * Your grade will be based on your overall performance in class, labs,
      group meetings, and quizzes. They count approximately as follows:
      2 Quizzes: 40 %
      Lab performance and reports: 40%
      Class participation and group meetings: 20 %
    * The quizzes are closed book and cover material from the lectures as well
      as the labs.
    * Technical Instructors and TAs will grade your lab reports. There will be
      a box marked '2.008' in front of Computer room. You are required to drop
      off lab reports in the box by their due dates.
    * All lab reports are due exactly one week after they have been assigned.
      No late reports will be accepted unless you have made prior arrangements
      with Technical Instructors and TAs.
***** Homework *****
    * You are required to turn in the homework assignments by the due dates.
      The assignments will be graded by TAs.
***** Group Meetings *****
    * Each student as part of a lab group manufacturing a yo-yo will be
      required to meet once a week outside of class and lab. Your team will be
      established during the first lab session and should designate the weekly
      meeting time.
    * These group meetings are to aid you in making design decisions, part
      dimensions, homework solutions, etc., as informed team members.
    * Please take down minutes of the meetings each week, as they will help you
      in performing peer evaluations at the end of the semester.
***** Plant Tour *****
    * Plant tours to a manufacturing facility (TBA) are scheduled for week 11.
    * You are encouraged to attend either one of the tours.
