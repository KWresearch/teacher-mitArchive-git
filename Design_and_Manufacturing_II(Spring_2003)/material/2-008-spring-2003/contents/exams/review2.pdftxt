The laser’s energy, P , is delivered uniformly over an area of πr 2 . In order to cut through this
material, a volume of πr2 h mm3 must be evaporated. This volume will require

e =

πr2 hEvaporize
ρ

Joules

of energy to vaporize. If P represents watts of laser power available, then P /e seconds are
required for the laser to cut through the material. Since the laser can safely move 2r during
this interval, the cutting velocity can be

vc = 2re/P

This assumes that none of the heat is lost to diffusion. In fact, if v c is greater than the rate of

diffusion, this is assumption is valid.

Laser Cutting


The laser beam is focused onto a circle of radius r .  Assume that all of the energy of the laser 
is all delivered to this circle, and that all of the energy is used in the cutting process (ie, there 
is no energy loss due to spectral absorption).  Let ρ be the density of the material, and let h 
be the material thickness. Write an equation governing speed of cutting to the power of the 
laser, P .

Forming [Q2 ’02] 

In addition to rate, quality is an  issue.  Assuming there are two painting stations, the two

stations do not provide the same quality.  The main factor for quality is alignment of the paint

layer with the embossed features in the sheet metal.

Both the average value for alignment and distribution of the alignment are impor tant to

overall quality.  The two stations in the manufacturing line differ in both mean value and

standard deviation.


Machine A: 
x = 0.80mm, σ  = 0.15 mm 
Machine B: 
x = 0.00 mm, σ = 0.48 mm 
The speciﬁcations for painting the  license plates call for alignment of 0 ± 1.0mm. 
Calculate Cp  and Cpk  for each machine.

Homework 7-3


Your enterprise is using a process which produces par ts whose  length have a mean 2.5in 
and standard deviation 0.015in.  You plan to make 100,000 of these par ts.  You have 
determined by taking into account the rework cost and the  loss of customer satisfaction that 
the quality loss function for the process is: 

L = 2250σ2 

where σ  is the standard deviation of  length of the par t and L  is the average quality lost  in

dollars per par t.

A very smar t but somewhat expensive Harvard graduate has offered you her exper t advice

on your process.  For every 0.001in reduction in the standard deviation of  the length of the

par t, she will charge $6000. 

How much of her advice do you buy?  (You can buy fractional amounts of her consulting).
