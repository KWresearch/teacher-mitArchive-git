The objective of this handout is to familiarize you with Mastercam, and provide a quick reference 
to some of the features. 

Some useful info to help streamline your experience: 

•	   The underlined letters in the menu words are  “hot ” keys for the particular function. 
You may navigate the menus from the keyboard while drawing the geometry with the 
mouse, it is very efficient running Mastercam this way. 

•	

•	

It is a good practice to turn on the number pad since we are keying in values 
frequently. 

“Auto-cursor ” snaps to end points, midpoints, and centers of entities. 

•	   Right clicking the mouse displays a drop down menu of common functions.  You can 
shut off auto-cursor from this menu.  Sometimes auto-cursor is too sticky when 
entities are close together. 

•	 You do not need to be too accurate selecting entities.  The cursor is sensitive enough 
to select an entity without needing to be right on top of it. 

•	   Selection of entities using “polygon ” instead of  “window ” is useful when the entities 
you want to select surround other entities that you do not want.  This feature allows 
you to create a random shaped “selection window ” around the particular entities that 
you want. 

•	   ALT-W turns on viewports.  This is useful for viewing the top view, front view, and 
an isometric view all at the same time, especially when backplotting a toolpath to see 
the Z depths and tool movement.  Viewports can also be accessed from the Main 
menu through the Screen menu, Next menu, Viewports button. 

•	 ALT-H displays a help window for the current function you are working with. 

•	 The  function keys are  also  very  useful.  Allowing  you to turn on the  axes, zoom,  
unzoom, fit, and other functions without needing to use the mouse.

Commonly used function keys: 

F1: ZOOM

F2: UNZOOM

F3: REPAINT

F9: SHOW X0, Y0 AXES 


ALT F1: FIT 
ALT F2: UNZOOM by .8 
ALT F3: CURSOR TRACKING 
F10: KEY ASSIGNMENTS LIST 

The button bar across the top has most of these functions. 

Trimming 

Always select the portion of the entity you want to keep.  The portion of the entity on the 
other side of the intersecting entity will disappear, resulting in trimming the portion you click, to 
the intersecting entity.  Follow the prompts at the lower left of the screen. 

Level 

Main and Visible are most commonly used. Creating your geometry on level 1, and 
drafting on level 2 works well.  You can then make your drafting invisible when you run 
toolpaths. 

Color 

This displays the color pallet for changing the colors of entities.  The system defaults to 
green (#10) for geometry.  It also uses certain colors for showing that you have selected an entity, 
or for showing a result of a transform.  Toolpath feed moves are blue (#11).  When you perform 
transform function, the system identifies the selected entities as a  “group ” with the color red (#12) 
and identifies the transformed entities as a “result ” with the color purple (#13).  Group and result 
designations are saved with geometry.  Rapid movements of toolpaths are yellow (#14).  A 
selected entity is white (#15). 
Geometry brought in from Pro Engineer, or Solidworks may be white, change it to green 
so the color white can be used as intended.  If you want to change the default color it is suggested 
that you use colors other than 10 - 15 to minimize confusion. 

Branch Points 

Branch points are located where the endpoints of three or more entities meet.  Branch 
points are not automatically created at intersections.  You must break the entities to make them 
branch points.  To create a branch point, use the Modify, Trim, or Modify, Break functions. 

Drafting Globals 

Use this to alter the way dimensioning is displayed.  To get to the screen, from the Main 
Menu go to Create, Drafting, Globals.  It will display screens for altering drafting settings.  See 
Dimensioning, and Editing dimensions on page 7.

Mill Tools


Tools Manager lists all the tools in the tool library, or in your current job.  The tools in 
the Trktools library are the available tools we have setup for the EZ-Trak mills.  Clicking on the 
column headings will sort the list.  Generally you will only be accessing this list to get a tool to 
use. 

Double clicking on a tool will bring up a graphic display of the tool, showing its length, 
diameter, and clearance, along with the holder dimensions.  Parameter screens allow the editing 
of how the tool is to be used, such as depths of cut and step-over amounts for roughing as well as 
speed and feed for the tool to use.  These are already setup to fairly good values to minimize tool 
breakage.  Please refrain from editing the tools; if you believe you may have altered one by 
mistake please let us know so we can refresh it.

Mill Job Setup 

It is important that the toolpath configuration list has the boxes checked as they are in this 
screen shot.  It is not necessary to fill out the X, Y, Z fields.  Most important is that you do not 
want to assign tool numbers sequentially.  If they are assigned sequentially the machine will pick 
up the wrong tools.  Open this window when you first start Mastercam Mill.  From the Main 
Menu, Toolpaths, Job Setup.

Lathe Tools 


Lathe Tool Manager lists all the tools in the tool library, or in your current job, depending 
on what screens you have opened you will get either one or the other.  The tools in the Ltools 
library above, are the available tools we have in our machine.  Hovering the mouse over a tool 
will display a pop-up graphics view of the tool to aid in choosing the correct tool.  Clicking on the 
column headings will sort the list.  Turning off the filter will show all the tools.  Generally you 
will only be accessing this list to select a tool to use. 

Highlighting a tool by clicking it once, then clicking OK, will select the tool for the 
operation you have chained.  Double clicking on a tool opens the parameters of the tool and 
allows editing.  The right click menu allows you to display the tool by selecting Draw tool, so 
you can see if it ’s the one you want. 

Parameter screens for editing tools are not shown in this handout.  They allow the editing 
of the tool’s characteristics, such as the geometry of the holder, the insert, the orientation of the 
tool to the machine, depths of cut and step-over amounts for roughing as well as speed and feed 
for the tool to use.  These have been tailored by the staff, and are setup to reasonable values to 
minimize tool breakage.  Please refrain from editing the tools.  If you believe you may have 
altered one by mistake please let us know so we can refresh it.

Lathe Job Setup 

Stock dimensions must be defined in your geometry for the system to function properly 
without collisions.  This will be discussed in the lab.  This screen is used to identify where the 
material is, for the system to avoid collisions during entry/exit moves, and positioning moves. 
Without the use of this screen unpredictable results may occur resulting in possible tool breakage, 
or damage to the part or the machine.  It is important to note that the check box “Assign tool 
numbers sequentially” should not  be checked.

Dimensioning and Programming 


Dimensioning 

To alter drafting settings start from the  “MAIN MENU ”, go to  “C reate ”,  “D rafting”,  “G lobals”.  You can 
also edit most elements when you ’re in the middle of c reating the drafting dimensions.  In the process of 
creating drafting a menu of  “hot ” keys will appear acr oss the top of the geometry screen enabling you to 
alter the way a dimension looks before you land it in a fixed position. 

Editing dimensions 

Go to  “C reate ”,  “D rafting”,  “Multi e dit ”.  Select the dimension you want to move or edit, click  “D one ”. 
The Drafting Globals screen will appear.  You don’t have to do anything with it just click  “OK” to close it. 
Then select the dimension again that you want to alter, (just click it once), now it will move for you and the 
menu with the hot keys will be displayed so you can edit the elements before you click again to fix it in a 
new location. 

Saving files 

You must save your files with names that are 8 characters or less, and have the extension  “.txt”.  The EZ-
Traks are DOS based and do not recognize files with long names, or other extensions.  Change the default 
path to your assigned lab section folder to save your work.  Mastercam will default to C:\temp, it is cleaned 
out when you log off so save your docs to your folder when you begin a session, and save often. 

Changing the editor 

ile ”,  “E dit ”,  “E ditor ”, change to  “MCEDIT ” if you want to have the 
From the  “MAIN MENU ”, go to  “F
option of changing incremental values to absolute.  The default editor will work for normal editing. 

Incremental (G91) and Absolute (G90) 

If your geometry is such that it is easier for you to program using incremental values for some features, you 
may do so.  Enter a  “G91 ” on the lines of code that are incremental values.  Be careful to include a  “G90 ” 
on the Z-axis moves.  You always want to know where the Z-axis is in absolute values.  Remember,  “G91, 
and  “G90 ” are in the same modal group and each one will remain in effect until the other is used. 

If you want to alter a string of incremental values to absolute, so you don’t have to worry about the mode 
you ’re in (G91, or G90), the  “MCEDIT ” editor has the function to alter the values. 

Altering incremental values to absolute values with the  “MCEDIT ” editor: 
1. 	   Highlight the lines of code you want to alter.  The highlighted lines must include the start point, 
and that must be in absolute values, and include both the X, and Y-axes.  The start point will not 
be altered, but all the values after the start point will be altered, and calculated using the start point 
values. 
2.	   Select the  “NC utils” menu in the editor window.  Select  “Incremental to Absolute”, a dialog box 
will open asking for the axes you wish to alter, select only X,  and Y,  you  want  Z  to remain  
absolute.  You always want to know where Z is in absolute values. 

Z-zero 

Always set Z-zero at the top surface of the work-piece.  This is the logical place for referencing the Z-axis. 
The industry standard is such that all Z depths are negative, and any Z positive values are usually in the 
clear so that you can rapid-position from feature to feature without worrying about running into the work 
piece when you are in the positive region.  Unfortunately the EZ-Trak machines have not followed the rules 
of the industry for drilling.

Drilling 

Drilling depths are handled totally different than milling depths on the EZ-Trak machines. 
Drilling depths are taken as incremental positive values from the clearance plane, where as all milling 
depths follow the industry rules and are absolute values and negative when the Z-axis zero is at the top 
surface of the work-piece. 
On a  “G81 ”, or  “G83 ” block, you must include the X, and Y values of the hole position even if you have 
positioned there from home.  The block must also include a positive Z that is the sum of the depth you want 
to drill plus the clearance plane (R) value, include the R value as well, and the feed rate for the plunge.  For 
example:  “G81G90X1.Y-.5Z.2R.1F5. ”  This will drill a hole -.1 ” deep. 
For peck drilling (G83), all the above applies but in addition, another Z must be included to state only the 
peck amount itself. It is also positive and is an incremental value.  The Z for the peck value must follow the 
Z depth value.  For example:  “G83G90X1.Y-.5Z.6Z.09R.1F5. ” This will drill to a depth of -.5 ”, pulling 
out to the  “R” level every time it drills .09 ” deeper until reaching the final depth.  It is not necessary to 
make sure that the peck amounts add up to the final depth.  The drilling will only go to the final depth. 

Testing 

Testing your program with Reverse Post-processing and using Backplot. 
1.	 Save your handwritten program, make sure it is a  “.txt” file.  Leave it open and displayed so you 
may edit it easily if there is something wrong. 
2.	 Save your Mastercam geometry file, do not change the filename extension leave it as  “.MC8 ”.

initialize Mastercam. 
4. 	   From the  “MAIN MENU ”, go to  “N C utils”,  “P ost proc ”,  “Rev erse ”, go to where you saved your 
“.txt” program file and select it.  Mastercam will create an “.NCI ” (intermediate file) file to write 
to, it will default to the name you named the  “.txt” file, that ’s OK.  It will display the binary code 
file it creates.  This binary code file is what it will use to drive the Backplot display. 
5.	   Close the  “.NCI ” file, then go back to the  “N C utils” menu and click,  “B ackplot ”.  In the lower left 
of the screen it will show the  “.NCI ” filename it will read for the backplot.  It should be displaying 
the one Mastercam just created, if not, select the NCI file you want to read, by clicking  “N CI 
name ”. 
6.	   Then click on  “Gview: T ”, the lowest button on the menu and select  “I
you to view movement in all 3 axes. 
7. 	   Then select Step.  Each time you click  “S tep ” you will see the movement the program is 
outputting.  Blue lines are feed movements.  Yellow lines are rapid moves.  If anything looks 
wrong you can edit the line of code that is causing the problem, and reverse post-process the file 
again. 

sometric”, this will enable 

Distinguishing what is correct 

Vertical lines going in the  “down (Z negative) ” direction must be blue signifying a feed movement. (You 
don’t want to rapid into the work!) Once you are in the work (Z negative area) all horizontal lines must also 
be blue (feeding).  Vertical lines going up from a blue horizontal line should be yellow signifying a rapid 
movement out of the work-piece.  Once a yellow ‘up ’ line appears it ’s usually followed by another  ‘rapid ’ 
move signifying a positioning move to another location.  It would be expensive to waste time to position to 
a new location in a feed mode.  Grading will take these issues into account.  Moves to, or from machine 
home are not displayed. 

Speeds and Feeds 

Recommended Speeds, feeds, and depths of cut for the available tools 
All spindle speeds should be 3000 RPM, except the 1.5 ” end mill, which should be run at 500 RPM for cuts 
deeper than .050 ”.  1.5 ” end mill can be run at 2000 RPM for face milling, where the maximum depth of 
cut would be only .010 ”-.015 ” deep.

Recommended Feed Rates for machining Aluminum 

1/16 ” end mill:  plunge at 2 ”/min., feed at 4 ”/min 
1/8 ” end mill: 
plunge at 3 ”/min., feed at 5 ”/min 
plunge at 5 ”/min., feed at 10 ”/min 
¼ ” end mill: 
plunge at 5 ”/min., feed at 15 ”/min 
3/8 ” end mill: 
plunge at 5 ”/min., feed at 15 ”/min 
½ ” end mill: 
1.5 ” end mill: 
plunge at 5 ”/min., feed at 20 ”/min 
All taper mills:  plunge at 5 ”/min., feed at 10 ”/min 
#1Center drill: 
plunge at 5 ”/min. 
#4 Center drill:  plunge at 10 ”/min. 

Depths of cut for Aluminum 

For the 1/16 ”-1/2 ” end mills: 1/3 the end mill diameter per level.

Maximum final depth for the 1/16 ”-1/2 ” end mills is 3X their diameters.


For the taper mills: 1/16 ” per level, except the engraving tool. 


For the 1.5 ” end mill: .100 ” per level. 


Engraving tool: .010 ” per level to a maximum depth of .030”  (the tip angle is 60 degrees). 

For fine engraving: .005 ”-.007 ” max depth.  Produce a flat uniform surface by face milling the surface first 

using the 1.5 ” end mill.


Drawing & Dimensioning Grading 

Guideline for grading Paperweight drawings, and drawings produced in the Yo-yo labs. 

Dimensioning features where points will be taken. First occurrence basis per report 
based on a perfect score of 10. 

0.1  Point issues: 

1. 	 Line thickness: dimensions, center lines, phantom lines, leaders, and arrows, to be finer 
than drawing lines 
2. 	 Missing center lines 
3. 	 Missing center points 
4. 	 Missing arrows, unless ordinate dimensioning is used 
5. 	 Both arrows point same way 

0.2  Point issues: 

6. 	 Showing tangencies. 
7. 	 Arrows pointing to radii at quadrants, or arrows do not point to or go through the center 
of the radius. 
8. 	 Overlapping dimensions, arrows, or leaders.  General clutter causing difficulty reading 
print. 
9. 	 Not using an extra print when necessary to minimize clutter, or to clarify a detail. 
10.  Double dimensioning 
11.  Wrong way to show dimension, such as showing a diameter as a radius, or visa versa 
12.  Having dimensions in parenthesis when you do not intend the dimension to be shown as a
