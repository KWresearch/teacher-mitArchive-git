1. Consider a collisionless plasma in equilibrium for which ∂ /∂ y = ∂ /∂ z = 0, B = B ˆz is
uniform, in which density and temperature gradients exist in the x direction. Particles at
position r are assumed to have a Maxwellian distribution of y -velocity that depends only
on their gyro-center: r0
(cid:2)1/2
(cid:1)

exp[−mvy /2T (r0 )].

f (r, vy ) = n(r0 )

m
2πT (r0 )

This varies only with the x component of the gyrocenter r0 (and with v of course). Expand
the distribution function about the (instantaneous) particle position, to ﬁrst order in the
(assumed small) gyroradius, remembering that the position of the gyro-center relative to
the particle can be written

r0 − r = −rL = −

. 

Hence show that there is a mean y -velocity of the particles when integrated over the
distribution. Show that it is consistent with a ﬂuid expression for diamagnetic velocity.

2. Show that the single ﬂuid (MHD) momentum equation can be written in the conservative
form

3. A certain tokamak plasma with pure hydrogen ions has uniform electron and ion
temperatures equal to 1 keV, density n = 5 × 1019 m3 , density-gradient in the minor
radial direction dn/dr = n/L with L = 0.2 m, toroidal ﬁeld Bφ = 2 T, poloidal ﬁeld
Bθ = 0.2 T, current density, j = 106 A/m2 , and time dependence such that for any
quantity g , dg/dt = g/τ with τ = 1 s.
(a) If the current density is in the toroidal direction and the plasma velocity is zero, eval-
uate to one signiﬁcant ﬁgure the magnitude of each of the terms in the full generalized
Ohm’s law.
(b) Repeat this calculation for those terms that are diﬀerent, under the alternative as-
sumption that the current density ﬂows in a direction that ensures that ∇p = j ∧ B.
