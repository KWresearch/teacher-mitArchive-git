1. Consider a plasma in which both electrons and (singly-charged) ions adopt thermal
distributions with Boltzmann factors governed by their respective temperatures Te
and Ti (which are diﬀerent). Show that in the approximation eφ (cid:1) Te , Ti , such a
plasma is governed by an equation of the form
∇2φ =
1 φ,
λ2
and obtain an expression for λ. Does the situation of cold ions, Ti (cid:1) Te , correspond
to the idealized case of “immobile” ions one ﬁnds textbooks?
2. Consider a charged sphere of radius a, located far from all other ob jects in a plasma
that has immobile ions and mobile electrons of temperature Te . The electrons can
be assumed to adopt a Boltzmann distribution, n = n∞ exp(eφ/Te ), where φ is the
electrostatic potential and n∞ is the background density of the singly charged ions.
(a) Solve Poisson’s equation to obtain the potential distribution in the plasma when
the potential on the sphere is φs , in the approximation φs (cid:1) Te/e.
(b) Sketch the form of φ as a function of radius r in the cases, (i) λD (cid:1) a and (ii)
λd (cid:3) a.
(c) Calculate the charge on the sphere, and hence its capacitance in the presence of
the plasma.

(d) Evaluate the capacitances when a = 0.1 m, for the case Te = 1 keV and (i) n =
1020m−3 , (ii) n = 1012m−3 , and compare with the capacitance in vacuum.

3. Electrons move without collisions in a one dimensional (slab) conﬁguration from a
cathode at x = 0, where they are at rest, to an anode at potential φA relative to the
cathode and a distance xA from it. There are no ions. Suppose there is a current den-
sity j of electrons. Derive the self-consistent equation governing the electric potential,
from the equation of motion of the electrons and Poisson’s equation in the presence
of this charge density. Reduce this second order diﬀerential equation to ﬁrst order, by
(cid:1) (cid:2)2
noting that
dφ d2φ
1 d
dφ
=

2 dx
dx dx2
dx
and regarding speciﬁed electric ﬁeld E0 = −(dφ/dx)0 , at x = 0 as the boundary
condition. The maximum value of E0 allowed physically is zero, otherwise electrons
will be repelled back to the cathode. By solving Poisson’s equation with E0 = 0,
obtain an expression for the maximum possible current density.
