1. Calculate ln Λ for a plasma with ne = ni = 1020m−3 and Te = 5 keV, in the following
situations:
(a) A high energy electron beam of energy E=100keV, colliding with stationary hydrogen
ions.
(b) This beam colliding with the electrons in this plasma.
(c) The thermal collisions in this plasma.

2. This exercise is to explore the thermal collision frequency derivation by applying it to
(cid:1)
(cid:2)2
a diﬀerent distribution function, namely the shifted squared Lorentzian:

1
1
f (v) = n
(u − ud )2 + 1
3
π2 vt
where vt is a constant representing the thermal velocity, u ≡ v/vt , and ud = ˆexud , ud (cid:2) 1
is the normalized drift velocity. Expand this distribution to ﬁrst order in ud . Substitute
into the formula for the rate of momentum loss dp/dt to stationary targets. Use the same
trick based on the isotropy of the unshifted distribution to express the result in terms
of an integral over speed u. Perform that integral and hence derive νei for this electron
distribution function.

3. Calculate the mean free path for momentum loss (equal to the characteristic velocity
divided by the collision frequency) for
(a) An electron at thermal energy in a tokamak plasma of equal electron and ion temper-
atures 10keV, and density 0.5 × 1020 m−3 .
(b) A thermal ion in the same plasma.
(c) A thermal electron in a processing plasma of temperature 5 eV, and density 5 × 1018
m−3 .

4. A toroidal hydrogen plasma with circular cross-section has uniform temperature Te = 2
keV across its minor radius, a = 0.3m. The ma jor radius is R = 1.2m. Calculate the
toroidal electric ﬁeld Eφ required to drive a current of 4 × 105A the long way round the
torus, and hence the required one-turn toroidal E.M.F. (called the “loop voltage”). [You
may do this calculation to lowest order in a/R, and adopt a generic value of ln Λ]
Calculate, ignoring relativity, the minimum parallel energy at which an electron be-
comes a “runaway” if the density of this plasma is 1019 m−3 . Does this energy justify your
ignoring relativistic eﬀects?
