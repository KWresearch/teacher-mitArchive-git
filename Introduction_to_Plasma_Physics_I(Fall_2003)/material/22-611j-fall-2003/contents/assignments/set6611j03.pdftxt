1. A θ-pinch in MHD equilibrium has magnetic ﬁeld that is
B (r) = Bo + (Ba − Bo ) r/a, for 0 ≤ r ≤ a ,

where the plasma edge is r = a, at which point the plasma pressure, p, is zero. Calculate:
(a) The pressure proﬁle, p(r).
(b) The current density proﬁle j (r).

(c) The maximum possible value of the beta, 2µo < p > /B .a
where < p > is the volume averaged plasma pressure:

2. A pure z-pinch (no Bz ) has current density
j = jo (1 − r/a)

and pressure equal to zero at the plasma boundary, r = a.
(a) Calculate the magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle, B (r).
(b) Calculate the pressure proﬁle, p(r).
(c) Hence show that the central pressure is p(0) = µo j 2a2 /18.

3. MHD power generators may possibly be a more eﬃcient way of converting heat into
electricity. Think of one as consisting of a simple rectangular channel of (x-) width a,
(y-) height b, in which the plasma ﬂows under pressure in the z-direction. Take the
plasma density and velocity to be uniform. A uniform magnetic ﬁeld, B, is applied in
the y-direction and the walls at x = 0, a are electrodes where the electric current density
(density j, assumed uniform) is picked oﬀ at a voltage diﬀerence φ. Use the MHD equations
to answer the following questions.
(a) If the resistivity, η , of the plasma is negligible, what is the plasma velocity?
(b) If the pressure is po at z = 0, what is its value as a function of z?
(c) How much electric power is generated per unit length of the channel?

(d) What is the rate of doing work per unit channel length by the plasma pressure force?
(e) If η is not negligible but can be considered ﬁxed, and the ﬂow velocity and B-ﬁeld are
also ﬁxed but the current density can be varied, what is the maximum electric power
per unit length that can be generated?

4. The “osculating plane” at a certain point on a curve in 3-D diﬀerential geometry is the
plane that contains both the tangent vector to the curve and the radius of curvature. Prove
that for a force-free MHD equilibrium, ∇B lies in the osculating plane of the magnetic
ﬁeld line.

5. For a z -pinch equilibrium which has zero plasma pressure at the plasma edge, r = a,
prove by integrating the MHD force balance equation a second time that the volume-
averaged pressure is a function only of the total current, and ﬁnd that function.
If a hydrogen plasma z-pinch has uniform density n = 1020 m−3 , temperature Te =
Ti = T0 (1 − r2 /a2 ) with T0 = 10 keV, and radius a = 0.01 m, what current is required?
