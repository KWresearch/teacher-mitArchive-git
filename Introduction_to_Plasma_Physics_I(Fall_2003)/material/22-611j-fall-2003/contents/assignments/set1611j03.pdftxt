1. Distribution functions and averages. The average of a quantity G(v) over a distribu-
tion function f (v) is deﬁned as
(cid:1)

(cid:1)G(cid:2) =

(cid:1)
G(v)f (v)d3 v
f (v)d3 v
The Maxwellian distribution (in three dimensions) is

Note that the isotropy of this distribution means that all cartesian coordinates are
(cid:1)
equivalent, there is no preferred direction.

(a) Prove that the form of f is correctly normalized, i.e. that

f d3 v = n. 

Evaluate the averages of the following 
(b) a speciﬁc cartesian coordinate: (cid:1)vx (cid:2)
(c) the square velocity: (cid:1)v2 (cid:2), and hence the average particle energy (cid:1) mv

(d) the average speed (cid:1)|v |(cid:2)
2. Show that for any distribution function that is isotropic, i.e.  a function only of the
magnitude |v |, that one can integrate over those particles whose velocity component
along one axis is positive (omitting the negative velocity particles) in order to prove
that the ﬂux density with which particles impinge upon a surface from one side only
is 1 n(cid:1)|v |(cid:2) (often the notation (cid:1)|v |(cid:2) = ¯
v or ¯
c is used).

3. Basic facts you need to know.  Find out, write down, and memorize (to 2 signiﬁcant
ﬁgures in SI units unless otherwise indicated) the values of the following quantities

The permitivity of free space, 0 . 

The permeability of free space, µ0 .

The charge on the electron e. 

The mass of the electron me . 

The mass of the proton mi . 

The temperature in Kelvins, equal to 1 eV. 
The particle density of the air you are breathing (m−3 ). 
The pressure of the air you are breathing in torr and Pascals. 
The density of particles in water (m−3 ). 
The ionization potential of the hydrogen atom. 

The relationship between magnetic units Gauss and Tesla. 

The relationship between particles per cubic centimeter and per cubic meter.

and the Debye length is small relative to the discharge size. Calculate approximately
the temperature at which the gas is 50% ionized if χi = 13eV, and its total pressure is
equal to one atmosphere. What is then the ratio of the electron density to the density
of a room-temperature gas at the same pressure?
