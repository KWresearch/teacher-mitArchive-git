1. Consider a charged particle moving in the x-y plane under the inﬂuence of a magnetic
ﬁeld varying slowly with x, pointing in the z-direction, B = B (x)ˆez and uniform
electric ﬁeld in the y-direction, E = E ˆey , (E /B < c). Show that as a result of
the grad-B drift, the particle has work done on it by the electric ﬁeld. Thus, show
1
explicitly from conservation of energy, that the quantity 2 mv2 /B is constant in this
situation.
2. The E ∧ B drift cannot exceed the speed of light. Therefore particle motion in crossed
electric and magnetic ﬁelds needs to be treated relativistically when E/B > c. [Note
that this occurs as B → 0.] By integrating the relativistic equation of motion:

or otherwise, show what happens to the particle orbit when E/B > c, and sketch the
orbit when B is in the z-direction, E is in the x-direction, and z-motion is neglected.
3. Electrons in a magnetic mirror have a distribution function fo (v) at its center, where
the ﬁeld magnitude is Bo . The highest ﬁeld, in the mirror throat, is B1 . Calculate

4. A particle of mass m and charge q moves in uniform magnetic ﬁeld B pointing in the
z -direction under the inﬂuence of a line-charge of magnitude Q per unit length aligned
along the z -axis. (The conﬁguration is invariant in the z -direction.)

(a) Calculate the tra jectory of its guiding center and the time elapsed before the x
and y coordinates return to their initial values.

(b) If the magnetic ﬁeld is allowed to vary in time with a small constant time

(c) Is the sum of particle kinetic energy and electrostatic potential energy (qφ) con-
stant? Do the charge and mass of the particle matter?

5. A uniform hydrogen plasma of inﬁnite length, and temperature T equal for electrons
and ions, surrounds a straight inﬁnite cylindrical conductor carrying current I . If the
perturbation of the magnetic ﬁeld by currents in the plasma is negligible,

(a) What is the mean electron drift?

(b) What is the mean ion drift?

(c) What is the mean current density?

(d) [This last part is quite diﬃcult and will be for bonus marks]. If the perturbation
of the plasma currents to the magnetic ﬁeld is not negligible, and the inner edge
of the plasma is at r = a, calculate the magnetic ﬁeld as a function of radius.
