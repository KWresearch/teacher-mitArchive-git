Motion  of  Charged  Particles  in  Fields


Plasmas are complicated because motions of electrons and ions are determined by the electric

and magnetic  ﬁelds  but  also  change  the  ﬁelds  by  the  currents  they  carry.

For now we shall ignore the second part of the problem and assume that Fields are Prescribed.

Even  so,  calculating  the motion  of  a  charged  particle  can  be  quite  hard.

Have to solve this diﬀerential equation, to get position r and velocity (v= r˙ ) given E(r, t), B(r, t).

Direction  of  rotation  is  as  indicated  opposite  for  opposite  sign  of  charge: 

Ions  rotate  anticlockwise.  Electrons  clockwise  about  the magnetic  ﬁeld.

The  current  carried  by  the  plasma  always  is  in  such  a  direction  as  to  reduce  the  magnetic

ﬁeld.

This  is  the  property  of  a magnetic material  which  is  “Diagmagnetic”.

Perpendicular  Motion

Qualitatively:

Speed  of  positive  particle  is  greater  at  top  than  bottom  so  radius  of  curvature  is  greater.

Result  is  that  guiding  center  moves  perpendicular  to  both  E  and  B.  It  ‘drifts’  across  the

ﬁeld.

Algebraically:  It  is  clear  that  if  we  can  ﬁnd  a  constant  velocity  vd  that  satisﬁes

E + vd  ∧ B = 0 

(2.14) 

19 

Figure  2.3:  E ∧ B  drift  orbit 

then  the  sum  of  this  drift  velocity  plus  the  velocity 

d 
vL  = [rLe iΩ(t−t0 ) ]

which  we  calculated  for  the  E = 0  gyration  will  satisfy  the  equation  of motion. 
Take  ∧B  the  above  equation: 
0 = E ∧ B + (vd  ∧ B) ∧ B = E ∧ B + (vd .B)B − B 2 vd 

so  that 

does  satisfy  it.

(2.17) 

(2.18) 

(2.19) 

1.  It  is  independent  of  the  properties  of  the  drifting  particle  (q, m,  v,  whatever). 

2.  Hence  it  is  in  the  same  direction  for  electrons  and  ions. 
3.  Underlying  physics  for  this  is  that  in  the  frame moving  at  the  E ×  B  drift  E =  0.  We 
have  ‘transformed  away’  the  electric  ﬁeld. 

4.  Formula  given	 above  is  exact  except  for  the  fact  that  relativistic  eﬀects  have  been 
ignored.  They  would  be  important  if  vd  ∼ c. 

20 

2.2.1  Drift  due  to  Gravity  or  other  Forces 

Suppose  particle  is  sub ject  to  some  other  force,  such  as  gravity.	 Write  it  F  so  that 
1 
mv˙ = F + q  v ∧ B = q(  F + v ∧ B)	
q 

(2.20) 

This  is  just  like  the  Electric  ﬁeld  case  except  with  F/q  replacing  E. 
The  drift  is  therefore 
1 F ∧ B 
q B 2 
In  this  case,  if  force  on  electrons  and  ions  is  same,  they  drift  in  opposite  directions. 

This general  formula can be used  to get  the drift velocity  in  some other cases of  interest  (see

later).


vd  =

(2.21) 

2.3  Non­Uniform  B  Field 

If  B­lines  are  straight  but  the  magnitude  of  B  varies  in  space  we  get  orbits  that  look  quali­
tatively  similar  to  the  E ⊥  B  case: 

Figure  2.4:  �B  drift  orbit 

Curvature of orbit  is greater where B  is greater causing  loop to be small on that side.  Result 
is  a  drift  perpendicular  to  both  B  and  �B.  Notice,  though,  that  electrons  and  ions  go  in 
opposite  directions  (unlike  E ∧ B). 

Algebra 

We  try  to  ﬁnd  a  decomposition  of  the  velocity  as  before  into  v  =  vd  + vL  where  vd  is 
constant.

We  shall ﬁnd  that  this  can be done  only  approximately.  Also we must have  a  simple  expres­

sion  for  B.  This  we  get  by  assuming  that  the  Larmor  radius  is  much  smaller  than  the  scale

length  of  B  variation  i.e., 

| 
rL  << B /|�B	

(2.22) 

21 

(2.23) 

in  which  case  we  can  express  the  ﬁeld  approximately  as  the  ﬁrst  two  terms  in  a  Taylor 
expression: 
B � B0  + (r.�)B 
Then  substituting  the  decomposed  velocity  we  get: 
dv 
=  m ˙vL  = q(v ∧ B) = q [vL  ∧ B0  + vd  ∧ B0  + (vL  + vd ) ∧ (r.�)B] 
m 
dt 
0  =  vd  ∧ B0  + vL  ∧ (r.�)B + vd  ∧ (r.�)B 
or 
(2.25) 
Now  we  shall  ﬁnd  that  vd/vL  is  also  small,  like  r|�B /B .  Therefore  the  last  term  here  is 
|
second  order  but  the  ﬁrst  two  are  ﬁrst  order.  So  we  drop  the  last  term. 
Now  the  awkward  part  is  that  vL  and  rL  are  periodic.  Substitute  for  r = r0  + rL  so 
0 = vd  ∧ B0  + vL  ∧ (rL .�)B + vL  ∧ (r0 .�)B 
∝ e
iΩt−
We  now  average  over  a  cyclotron  period.  The  last  term  is
0 = vd  ∧ B + �vL  ∧ (rL .�)B�  . 

so  it  averages  to  zero: 

(2.24) 

(2.26) 

(2.27) 

To  perform  the  average  use 

rL  = (xL , yL )  =

2.4  Curvature  Drift 

(2.36) 

(2.37) 

When  the  B­ﬁeld  lines  are  curved  and  the  particle  has  a  velocity  v�  along  the  ﬁeld,  another 
drift  occurs.

Take  |B constant;  radius  of  curvature  Re .
| 
To  1st  order  the  particle  just  spirals  along  the  ﬁeld. 
In  the  frame  of  the  guiding  center  a  force  appears  because  the  plasma  is  rotating  about  the

center  of  curvature. 

This  centrifugal  force  is  Fcf

This  is  the  “Curvature  Drift”. 

It  is  often  convenient  to  have  this  expressed  in  terms  of  the  ﬁeld  gradients.  So  we  relate Rc

to �B  etc.  as  follows:


Figure  2.6:  Diﬀerential  expression  of  curvature

2.4.1  Vacuum  Fields 
Relation  between �B  & Rc  drifts 
The  curvature  and  �B  are  related  because  of  Maxwell’s  equations,  their  relation  depends 
on  the  current  density  j.  A  particular  case  of  interest  is  j = 0:  vacuum  ﬁelds.

and  hence  (�B )perp  = −B  Rc/R2 .c

Notice  the  following: 
1.  Rc  & �B  drifts  are  in  the  same  direction. 
2.  They  are  in  opposite  directions  for  opposite  charges. 

3.  They  are  proportional  to  particle  energies 
4.  Curvature ↔  Parallel  Energy  (×  2) 
↔  Perpendicular  Energy

5.  As a  result one  can very quickly  calculate  the average drift over a  thermal distribution

Interlude:  Toroidal  Conﬁnement  of  Single  Parti­
cles 

Since  particles  can  move  freely  along  a  magnetic  ﬁeld  even  if  not  across  it,  we  cannot  ob­
viously  conﬁne  the  particles  in  a  straight  magnetic  ﬁeld.  Obvious  idea:  bend  the  ﬁeld  lines 
into  circles  so  that  they  have  no  ends.

(2.87) 

Consider  a  plane  rectangular  circuit  carrying  current  I  having  elementary  area  dxdy  =  dA. 
Regard  this  as  a  vector  pointing  in  the  z  direction  dA.  The  force  on  this  circuit  in  a  ﬁeld 
B(r)  is  F  such  that 
Fx  =  I dy [Bz (x + dx) − Bz (x)] = I dydx

(Using �.B = 0). 
Hence,  summarizing:  F = I dydx�Bz .  Now  deﬁne  µ = I dA = I dydxˆz  and  take  it  constant. 
Then  clearly  the  force  can  be  written 
F = �(B.µ) 

[Strictly = (�B).µ] 

(2.92) 

µ  is  the  (vector) magnetic moment  of  the  circuit.

The  shape of  the circuit does not matter  since any circuit can be  considered  to be composed 

of  the  sum  of many  rectangular  circuits.  So  in  general 


µ = I dA 

31 

(2.93) 

and  force  is 

F = �(B.µ)
(2.94) 
(µ  constant), 
We  shall  show  in  a  moment  that  |µ|  is  constant  for  a  circulating  particle,  regard  as  an 
elementary  circuit.  Also,  µ  for  a  particle  always  points  in  the  ­B  direction.  [Note  that  this 
means  that  the  eﬀect  of  particles  on  the  ﬁeld  is  to  decrease  it.]  Hence  the  force  may  be 
written 
F = −µ�B
