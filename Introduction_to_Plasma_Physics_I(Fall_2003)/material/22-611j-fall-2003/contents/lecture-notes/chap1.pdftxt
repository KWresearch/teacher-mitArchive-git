1.1  What  is  a  Plasma? 

1.1.1  An  ionized  gas 

A plasma is a gas in which an important fraction of the atoms is ionized, so that the electrons

and  ions  are  separately  free. 

When  does  this  ionization  occur?  When  the  temperature  is  hot  enough.

Balance  between  collisional  ionization  and  recombination:


Figure  1.1:  Ionization  and  Recombination 

Ionization  has  a  threshold  energy.  Recombination  has  not  but  is much  less  probable.

Threshold  is  ionization  energy  (13.6eV,  H).  χi

Integral  over  Maxwellian  distribution  gives  rate  coeﬃcients  (reaction  rates).  Because  of 

the  tail  of  the  Maxwellian  distribution,  the  ionization  rate  extends  below  T  =  χi .  And  in

equilibrium,  when

1.1.2  Plasmas  are  Quasi­Neutral 

If a gas of electrons and ions (singly charged) has unequal numbers, there will be a net charge 
density,  ρ. 
ρ = ne (−e) + ni (+e) = e(ni  − ne ) 
This  will  give  rise  to  an  electric  ﬁeld  via

This  results  in  a  force  on  the  charges  tending  to  expel  whichever  species  is  in  excess.  That 
is,  if  ni  > ne ,  the  E  ﬁeld  causes  ni  to  decrease,  ne  to  increase  tending  to  reduce  the  charge. 
This  restoring  force  is  enormous ! 

Example 
Consider  Te  = 1eV ,  ne  = 1019m−3  (a modest  plasma;  c.f.  density  of  atmosphere  nmolecules  ∼
3 × 1025m−3 ).  Suppose there is a small diﬀerence in ion and electron densities Δn = (ni − ne ) 

so  ρ = Δn  e 

Then  the  force  per  unit  volume  at  distance  x  is

Take Δn/ne  = 1%  , x = 0.10m. 
Fe  = (1017  × 1.6 × 10−19 )2  0.1/8.8 × 10−12  = 3 × 106N .m−3 
Compare  with  this  the  pressure  force  per  unit  volume ∼ p/x  : p ∼ neTe (+niTi ) 
Fp  ∼ 1019  × 1.6 × 10−19/0.1 = 16N m−3

This  is  one  aspect  of  the  fact  that,  because  of  being  ionized,  plasmas  exhibit  all  sorts  of  col­
lective behavior, diﬀerent  from neutral gases, mediated by the  long distance electromagnetic 
forces  E,  B. 
Another  example  (related)  is  that  of  longitudinal  waves.  In  a  normal  gas,  sound  waves  are 
propagated  via  the  intermolecular  action  of  collisions.  In  a  plasma,  waves  can  propagate 
when  collisions  are  negligible  because  of  the  coulomb  interaction  of  the  particles.

1.2.1  Elementary  Derivation  of  the  Boltzmann  Distribution 

Basic  principle  of  Statistical Mechanics:

Thermal  Equilibrium  ↔  Most  Probable  State  i.e.  State  with  large  number  of  possible  ar­

rangements  of micro­states.


Figure  1.4:  Statistical  Systems  in  Thermal  Contact 

Consider two weakly coupled systems S1 , S2  with energies E1 , E2 .  Let g1 , g2  be the number of 
microscopic  states which give  rise  to  these  energies,  for  each  system.  Then  the  total number 
of micro­states  of  the  combined  system  is  (assuming  states  are  independent) 

If  the  total  energy  of  combined  system  is  ﬁxed  E1  + E2  = Et  then  this  can  be  written  as  a 
function  of  E1 : 

g = g1g2

g1 (E1 )g2 (Et  − E1 )

g2  − g1

The most  probable  state  is  that  for  which  dg

Thus,  in  equilibrium,  states  in  thermal  contact  have  equal  values  of  d 
dE  ln g . 
One  deﬁnes  σ ≡  ln g  as  the  Entropy. 
dE  ln g ]−1  = T  the  Temperature. 
And  [  d 
Now  suppose  that we want  to  know  the  relative  probability  of  2 micro ­states  of  system  1  in 
equilibrium.  There  are,  in  all,  g1  of  these  states,  for  each  speciﬁc  E1  but  we  want  to  know 
how many  states  of  the  combined  system  correspond  to  a  single  microstate  of  S1 . 
Obviously that  is just equal to the number of states of system 2.  So, denoting the two values 
of  the  energies  of  S1  for  the  two  microstates  we  are  comparing  by  EA , EB  the  ratio  of  the 
number  of  combined  system  states  for  S1A  and  S1B  is 
g2 (Et  − EA ) 
= exp[σ(Et  − EA ) − σ(Et  − EB )] 
g2 (Et  − EB )

Now we suppose that system S2  is large compared with S1  so that EA  and EB  represent very

small  changes  in  S2 ’s  energy,  and  we  can  Taylor  expand 
g2 (Et  − EA ) 
dσ

Thus  we  have  shown  that  the  ratio  of  the  probability  of  a  system  (S1 )  being  in  any  two 
micro­states  A, B  is  simply 
−(EA  − EB ) 
exp 
T 
when  in  equilibrium with  a  (large)  thermal  “reservoir”.  This  is  the well­known  “Boltzmann 
factor”. 
You  may  notice  that  Boltzmann’s  constant  is  absent  from  this  formula.  That  is  because  of 
using  natural  thermodynamic  units  for  entropy  (dimensionless)  and  temperature  (energy). 
Boltzmann’s  constant  is  simply a  conversion  factor between  the natural  units  of  temperature 
(energy,  e.g.  Joules)  and  (e.g.)  degrees  Kelvin.  Kelvins  are  based  on  ◦C  which  arbitrarily 
choose melting  and  boiling  points  of  water  and  divide  into  100. 
Plasma  physics  is  done  almost  always  using  energy  units  for  temperature.  Because  Joules 
are  very  large,  usually  electron­volts  (eV)  are  used. 
1eV  = 11600K  = 1.6 × 10−19Joules. 

(1.17) 

(1.16) 

One  consequence  of  our  Botzmann  factor  is  that  a  gas  of  moving  particles  whose  energy  is 
mv adopts  the Maxwell­Boltzmann  (Maxwellian)  distribution  of  velocities ∝ exp[− mv ].

1.2.2  Plasma  Density  in  Electrostatic  Potential 

When  there  is  a  varying  potential,  φ,  the  densities  of  electrons  (and  ions)  is  aﬀected  by  it. 
If  electrons  are  in  thermal  equilibrium,  they  will  adopt  a  Boltzmann  distribution  of  density 
eφ 
ne  ∝ exp( 
)  . 
(1.18) 
Te 
This  is  because  each  electron,  regardless  of  velocity  possesses  a  potential  energy −eφ. 
Consequence  is  that  (ﬁg  1.5)  a  self­consistent  loop  of  dependencies  occurs. 
This is one elementary example of the general principle of plasmas requiring a self­consistent 
solution of Maxwell’s equations of electrodynamics plus  the particle dynamics of the plasma. 

1.2.3  Debye  Shielding 

A  slightly  diﬀerent  approach  to  discussing  quasi­neutrality  leads  to  the  important  quantity 
called  the  Debye  Length. 
Suppose  we  put  a  plane  grid  into  a  plasma,  held  at  a  certain  potential,  φg . 

10 

Figure  1.5:  Self­consistent  loop  of  dependencies

Then,  unlike  the  vacuum  case,  the  perturbation  to  the  potential  falls  oﬀ  rather  rapidly  into 
the  plasma.  We  can  show  this  as  follows.  The  important  equations  are:

This  is  called  the  Debye  Length 
Perturbations  to  the  charge  density  and  potential  in  a  plasma  tend  to  fall  oﬀ  with  charac­

teristic  length  λD .

In  Fusion  plasmas  λD  is  typically  small.  [e.g.  ne  = 1020m−3Te  = 1keV  λD  = 2 × 10−5m =

20µm]

Usually we  include as part of the deﬁnition  of a plasma that λD  << the size of plasma.  This

ensures  that  collective  eﬀects,  quasi­neutrality  etc.  are  important.  Otherwise  they  probably

aren’t.


1.2.4  Plasma­Solid  Boundaries  (Elementary) 

When a plasma is in contact with a solid, the solid acts as a “sink” draining away the plasma. 
Recombination  of  electrons  and  ions  occur  at  surface.  Then: 

1.  Plasma  is  normally  charged  positively  with  respect  to  the  solid. 

Figure  1.7:  Plasma­Solid  interface:  Sheath 

2.  There  is  a  relatively  thin  region  called  the  “sheath”,  at  the  boundary  of  the  plasma, 
where  the main  potential  variation  occurs. 

Reason  for  potential  drop: 
Diﬀerent  velocities  of  electrons  and  ions. 
If  there  were  no  potential  variation  (E=  0)  the  electrons  and  ions  would  hit  the  surface  at 
the  random  rate

Actually  our  previous  solution  was  valid  only  for  |eφ/Te << 1  which  is  no  longer  valid.

When −eφ/Te  > 1 (as will be the case  in the sheath).  We can practically  ignore the electron 
density,  in  which  case  the  solution  will  continue  only  quadratically.  One  might  expect, 
therefore,  that  the  sheath  thickness  is  roughly  given  by  an  electric  potential  gradient

(1.33) 

This  is  correct  for  the  typical  sheath  thickness  but  not  at  all  rigorous. 

1.3  The  ‘Plasma  Parameter’ 

Notice  that  in  our  development  of  Debye  shielding  we  used  nee  as  the  charge  density  and 
supposed  that  it  could  be  taken  as  smooth  and  continuous.  However  if  the  density  were  so 
low  that  there  were  less  than  approximately  one  electron  in  the  Debye  shielding  region  this 
approach  would  not  be  valid.  Actually  we  have  to  address  this  problem  in  3­d  by  deﬁning 
the  ‘Plasma  Parameter’, ND ,  as

If ND  ∼ 1  then  the  individual particles cannot be  treated as a  smooth continuum.  It will be 
<
seen later that this means that collisions dominate the behaviour:  i.e.  short range correlation 
is  just  as  important  as  the  long  range  collective  eﬀects. 
Often,  therefore  we  add  a  further  qualiﬁcation  of  plasma:

1.6.2  Self  Consistency 

In  solving  plasma  problems  one  usually  has  a  ‘circular’  system: 
The  problem  is  solved  only when we  have  a model  in which  all  parts  are  self  consistent.  We

need  a  ‘bootstrap’  procedure. 

Generally  we  have  to  do  it  in  stages:

•  Calculate  Plasma  Response  (to  given  E,B) 
•  Get  currents  &  charge  densities 
•  Calculate  E  & B  for  j,  p. 

Then  put  it  all  together.
