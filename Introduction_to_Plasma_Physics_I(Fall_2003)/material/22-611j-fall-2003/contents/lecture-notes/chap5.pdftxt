Electromagnetic  Waves  in  Plasmas


5.1 	 General Treatment  of Linear Waves  in Anisotropic 
Medium 

Start  with  general  approach  to  waves  in  a  linear Medium:  Maxwell: 

� ∧ B = µo j + 

1  ∂E	
c2  ∂ t 

;	

∂B 
� ∧ E = − 
∂ t 

(5.1) 

we keep all the medium’s response explicit in j.  Plasma is (inﬁnite and) uniform so we Fourier 
analyze  in  space  and  time.  That  is  we  seek  a  solution  in  which  all  variables  go  like 
exp i(k.x − ω t) 

[real  part  of ]	

(5.2) 

It  is really the  linearised equations which we treat this way;  if there  is some equilibrium ﬁeld 

OK  but  the  equations  above mean  implicitly  the  perturbations B,  E,  j,  etc.

Fourier  analyzed: 

−iω 
ik ∧ B = µo j + 
; 
c2  E 
Eliminate B  by  taking  k∧  second  eq.  and  ω×  1st 

ik ∧ E = iωB 

(5.3) 

ik ∧ (k ∧ E) = ωµo j − 

iω 2 
c2  E 

(5.4) 

So 

ω 2 
k ∧ (k ∧ E) +  E + iωµo j = 0 
2c
Now,  in  order  to  get  further  we  must  have  some  relationship  between  j  and  E(k, ω).  This 
will have  to  come  from  solving  the plasma  equations but  for now we  can  just write  the most 
general  linear  relationship  j  and  E  as 

(5.5) 

j = σ .E

σ  is  the  ‘conductivity  tensor’.  Think  of  this  equation  as  a matrix  e.g.:

Ez 

(5.7) 

This  is  a  general  form  of  Ohm’s  Law.  Of  course  if  the  plasma  (medium)  is  isotropic  (same 
in  all  directions)  all  oﬀ­diagonal  σ �s  are  zero  and  one  gets  j = σE. 
Thus 

ω 2 
k(k.E) − k2E +  E + iωµoσ .E = 0

Recall  that  in  elementary  E&M,  dielectric  media  are  discussed  in  terms  of  a  dielectric  con­
stant  �  and  a  “polarization”  of  the medium, P,  caused  by modiﬁcation  of  atoms.  Then

and  one  writes 

(5.10) 

.D = 

(5.9) 

(5.8) 

P = 

and 

Our  case  is  completely  analogous,  except  we  have  chosen  to  express  the  response  of  the 
medium  in  terms  of  current  density,  j,  rather  than  “polarization”  P  For  such  a  dielectric 
medium,  Ampere’s  law  would  be  written: 
� ∧ B = jext  +

if  jext  = 0  ,

where  the  dielectric  constant  would  be  � = 1 + χ. 
Thus, the explicit polarization current can be expressed in the form of an equivalent dielectric 
expression  if

Notice  the  dielectric  constant  is  a  tensor  because  of  anisotropy.  The  last  two  terms  come 
from  the  RHS  of  Ampere’s  law:

�o�.E	
∂ t 

∂ 
j + (�oE)  .	
∂ t 
If we were thinking in terms of a dielectric medium with no explicit currents, only implicit (in 
∂
�) we would write this  ∂ t (��oE); � the dielectric constant.  Our medium is possibly anisotropic 
∂
so  we  need  ∂ t (�o�.E)  dielectric  tensor.  The  obvious  thing  is  therefore  to  deﬁne

When  we  take  determinant  we  shall  get  a  quadratic  in  N 2  (for  given  ω)  provided  �  is  not

polarization  E  of  these  modes  will  be  in  general  partly  longitudinal  and  partly  transverse. 
The  point:  separation  into  distinct  longitudinal  and  transverse  modes  is  not  possible  in 
anisotropic media  (e.g.  plasma  with  Bo ). 
All  we  have  said  applies  to  general  linear  medium  (crystal,  glass,  dielectric,  plasma).  Now 
we  have  to  get  the  correct  expression  for  σ  and  hence  �  by  analysis  of  the  plasma  (ﬂuid)

5.2  High  Frequency  Plasma  Conductivity 

We  want,  now,  to  calculate  the  current  for  given  (Fourier)  electric  ﬁeld  E(k, ω),  to  get  the 
conductivity,  σ .  It  won’t  be  the  same  as  the  DC  conductivity  which  we  calculated  before 
(for  collisions)  because  the  inertia  of  the  species  will  be  important.  In  fact,  provided 
ω � ν¯ei 

(5.32) 

we  can  ignore  collisions  altogether.  Do  this  for  simplicity,  although  this  approach  can  be 
generalized. 
Also,  under  many  circumstances  we  can  ignore  the  pressure  force  −�p.  In  general  will 
be  true  if  ω  �  vte,i  We  take  the  plasma  equilibrium  to  be  at  rest:  vo  =  0.  This  gives  a 
k 
manageable  problem  with  wide  applicability. 
Approximations:

In  a  way,  these  oscillations  can  hardly  be  thought  of  as  a  ‘proper’  wave  because  they  do 
not  transport  energy  or  information.  (In Cold Plasma Limit).  [Nevertheless  they  do  emerge 
from  the  wave  analysis  and  with  less  restrictive  approxs  do  have  ﬁnite  vg .]

5.2.2  Meaning  of  Negative  N 2 :  Cut  Oﬀ 

When  N 2  < 0  (for  ω < ωp )  this  means  N  is  pure  imaginary  and  hence  so  is  k for  real  ω . 
Thus  the  wave  we  have  found  goes  like 
exp{±  k x − iω t
|
| 
} 

(5.57) 

i.e.  its space dependence is exponential not oscil latory.  Such a wave is said to be ‘Evanescent’ 
or  ‘Cut Oﬀ ’.  It does not truly propagate through the medium but  just damps exponentially. 
Example: 

Figure  5.4:  Wave  behaviour  at  cut­oﬀ.

5.3  Cold  Plasma  Waves 

(Magnetized  Plasma) 

Objective:  calculate  �,D, k(ω),  using  known  plasma  equations.

Approximation:  Ignore  thermal motion  of  particles.

Applicability:  Most  situations  where  (1)  plasma  pressure  and  (2)  absorption  are  negligible.

Generally  requires  wave  phase  velocity � vthermal .

5.3.1  Derivation  of  Dispersion  Relation 

(5.58) 

Can  “derive”  the  cold  plasma  approx  from  ﬂuid  plasma  equations.  Simpler  just  to  say  that 
all  particles  (of  a  speciﬁc  species)  just move  together  obeying  Newton’s  2nd  law: 
∂v 
m  = q(E + v ∧ B) 
∂ t 
Take  the  background  plasma  to  have  E0  =  0,  B  =  B0  and  zero  velocity.  Then  all  motion 
is  due  to  the  wave  and  also  the  wave’s  magnetic  ﬁeld  can  be  ignored  provided  the  particle 
speed  stays  small.  (This  is  a  linearization). 
∂v 
m  = q(E + v ∧ B0 ), 
∂ t 
where  v,  E ∝ exp i(k.x − ω t)  are  wave  quantities. 
Substitute  ∂  → −iω  and  write  out  equations.  Choose  axes  such  that B0  = B0 (0, 0, 1).

5.5  Electrostatic  Approximation  for  (Plasma)  Waves 

The  dispersion  relation  is  written  generally  as 
N ∧ (N ∧ E) + �.E = N(N.E) − N 2E + �.E = 0 

(5.128) 

Consider  E  to  be  expressible  as  longitudinal  and  transverse  components  E� ,  Et  such  that 
N ∧ E�  =  0, N.Et  = 0.  Then  the  dispersion  relation  can  be  written 
N (N.E� ) − N 2  (E�  + Et ) + �. (E�  + Et ) = −N 2Et  + �.Et  + �.E�  = 0 
�
� 
N 2  − �  .Et  = �.E� 
Now  the  electric  ﬁeld  can  always  be  written  as  the  sum  of  a  curl­free  component  plus  a 
divergenceless  component,  e.g.  conventionally 
�  ��  �

E = 

or 

(5.130) 

(5.131) 

and  these may  be  termed  electrostatic  and  electromagnetic  parts  of  the  ﬁeld. 
For  a  plane  wave,  these  two  parts  are  clearly  the  same  as  the  longitudinal  and  transverse 
parts  because 
−ikφ 
− �φ = 
is  longitudinal 
and  if �.A = 0  (because �.A = 0  (w.l.o.g.))  then  k.A = 0  so A  is  transverse.

(5.132)

‘Electrostatic’  waves  are  those  that  are  describable  by  the  electrostatic  part  of  the  electric 
ﬁeld,  which  is  the  longitudinal  part:  |E� | � |Et |. 
If we  simply  say Et  = 0  then  the  dispersion  relation  becomes  �.E�  = 0.  This  is  not  the most 
general  dispersion  relation  for  electrostatic  waves.  It  is  too  restrictive.  In  general,  there  is 
a  more  signiﬁcant  way  in  which  to  get  solutions  where  |E� | � |Et |.  It  is  for  N 2  to  be  very 
large  compared  to  all  the  components  of  �  : N 2  �� � �. 
If  this  is  the  case,  then  the  dispersion  relation  is  approximately 

N 2Et  = �.E�  ; 

(5.133) 

Et  is  small  but  not  zero. 
We  can  then  annihilate  the  Et  term  by  taking  the N  component  of  this  equation;  leaving 

N.�.E�  = (N.�.N) E�  = 0 

:  k.�.k = 0  . 

(5.134) 

When  the  medium  is  isotropic  there  is  no  relevant  diﬀerence  between  the  electrostatic  dis­
persion  relation: 

N.�.N = 0 

(5.135) 

and  the purely  longitudinal case �.N = 0.  If we choose axes  such  that N  is along ˆz,  then  the 
medium’s  isotropy  ensures  the  oﬀ­diagonal  components  of  �  are  zero  so N.�.N = 0  requires 
�zz  = 0 ⇒ �.N = 0.  However  if  the medium  is  not  isotropic,  then  even  if 
� 
� 
N.�.N  = N 2 �zz  = 0 

(5.136) 

there may  be  oﬀ­diagonal  terms  of  �  that make 

�.N = 0 

(5.137) 

In other words, in an anisotropic medium (for example a magnetized plasma) the electrostatic 
approximation  can  give  waves  that  have  non­zero  transverse  electric  ﬁeld  (of  order  ||�||/N 2 
times  E� )  even  though  the  waves  are  describable  in  terms  of  a  scalar  potential. 
To  approach  this  more  directly,  from  Maxwell’s  equations,  applied  to  a  dielectric  medium 
of  dielectric  tensor  �,  the  electrostatic  part  of  the  electric  ﬁeld  is  derived  from  the  electric 
displacement 
�.D = �. (�0�.E) = ρ = 0  (no  free  charges) 
So  for  plane  waves  0 = k.D = k.�.E = ik.�.kφ. 
The  electric  displacement,  D,  is  purely  transverse  (not  zero)  but  the  electric  ﬁeld,  E  then 
gives  rise  to  an  electromagnetic  ﬁeld  via  � ∧ H = ∂D/∂ t.  If  N 2  ��  � �  then  this  magnetic 
(inductive)  component  can  be  considered  as  a  benign  passive  coupling  to  the  electrostatic 
wave. 
In  summary,  the  electrostatic  dispersion  relation  is  k.�.k  =  0,  or  in  coordinates  where  k  is 
in  the  z­direction,  �zz  = 0.

5.7  Non­Uniform  Plasmas  and  wave  propagation 

Practical  plasmas  are  not  inﬁnite &  homogeneous.  So  how  does  all  this  plane wave  analysis 
apply  practically?

If  the  spatial  variation  of  the  plasma  is  slow  c.f.  the wave  length  of  the wave,  then  coupling

to  other  waves  will  be  small  (negligible).


Figure  5.11:  Comparison  of  sudden  and  gradualy  refractive  index  change. 
For  a  given  ω ,  slowly  varying  plasma means N/ dN  � λ  or  kN/ dN  � 1.  Locally,  the  plasma 
dx 
dx 
appears  uniform. 
Even  if  the  coupling  is  small,  so  that  locally  the wave  propagates  as  if  in  an  inﬁnite  uniform 
plasma,  we  still  need  a  way  of  calculating  how  the  solution  propagates  from  one  place  to 
the  other.  This  is  handled  by  the  ‘WKB(J)’  or  ‘eikonal’  or  ‘ray  optic’  or  ‘geometric  optics’ 
approximation.

Two  Stream  Instability


An  example  of  waves  becoming  unstable  in  a  non­equilibrium  plasma.  Analysis  is  possible

using  Cold  Plasma  techniques.

Consider a plasma with two participating cold species but having diﬀerent average velocities.

Path  of  velocity  integration 

First, realize that the solution we have found is not complete.  In fact a more general solution 
can  be  constructed  by  adding  any  solution  of 

∂ f1 
∂ f1 
+ v 
∂ t 
∂ z 
∂ f 
[We  are  dealing  with  1­d  Vlasov  equation:  ∂ t  + v ∂ f  +  qE  ∂ f  = 0.]  Solution  of  this  is 
∂ z 
m ∂ v 
f1  = g(v t − z , v) 

= 0 

(5.209) 

(5.210) 

where  g  is  an  arbitrary  function  of  its  arguments.  Hence  general  solution  is 

q  E ∂ f0

f1  =  m 
∂ v

i (ω − kv) 

exp i (kz − ω t) + g (v t − z , v) 

(5.211) 

and g must be determined by  initial conditions.  In general,  if we  start up  the wave  suddenly 
there  will  be  a  transient  that makes  g  non­zero. 

126 

So  instead  we  consider  a  case  of  complex  ω  (real  k  for  simplicity)  where  ω  =  ωr  + iωi  and

ωi  > 0.

This  case  corresponds  to  a  growing  wave:

exp(−iω t) = exp(−iωr t + ωi t) 
(5.212) 
Then  we  can  take  our  initial  condition  to  be  f1  = 0  at  t → −∞.  This  is  satisﬁed  by  taking 

g = 0.

For  ωi  > 0  the  complementary  function,  g ,  is  zero.

Physically  this  can  be  thought  of  as  treating  a  case  where  there  is  a  very  gradual,  smooth 
start  up,  so  that  no  transients  are  generated. 

Thus  if  ωi  >  0,  the  solution  is  simply  the  velocity  integral,  taken  along  the  real  axis,  with 

2  � 
no  additional  terms.  For

ω
The  pole  of  the  integrand  is  at  v =  k  which  is  above  the  real  axis. 
The question then arises as to how to do the calculation if ωi  ≤ 0. The answer is by “analytic

continuation”,  regarding  all  quantities  as  complex. 

“Analytic Continuation” of χ is accomplished by allowing ω/k to move (e.g.  changing the ωi )

but never allowing any poles  to cross  the  integration contour, as  things change continuously.

We  conclude  that  the  integration  contour  for  ωi  <  0  is  not  just  along  the  real  v  axis.  It 
includes  the  pole  also.

“Integrate  below  the  pole”. 
Contribution  from  the  pole  can  be  considered  to  arise  from  the  complementary  function 
g(v t − z , v).  If g  is to be proportional to exp(ikz ), then it must be of the form g = exp[ik(z − 
v t)]h(v) where h(v) is an arbitrary function.  To get the result previously calculated, the value

This  Dirac  delta  function  says  that  the  complementary  function  is  limited  to  particles  with 
“exactly”  the  wave  phase  speed  ω .  It  is  the  resonant  behaviour  of  these  particles  and  the 
k 
imaginary  term  they  contribute  to  χ  that  is  responsible  for  wave  damping.

We  shall  see  in  a  moment,  that  the  standard  case  will  be  ωi  <  0,  so  the  opposite  of  the

prescription  ωi  >  0  that  makes  g  =  0.  Therefore  there  will  generally  be  a  complementary

function,  non­zero,  describing  resonant  eﬀects.  We  don’t  have  to  calculate  it  explicitly 
because  the  Landau  prescription  takes  care  of  it.

A˜(p)  (i.e. 
where  the  path  of  integration  must  be  chosen  to  the  right  of  any  poles  of

enough).  Such a prescription  seems  reasonable.  If we make �(p)  large enough  then  the 
A˜(p) 
integral  will  presumably  exist.  The  inversion  formula  can  also  be  proved  rigorously  so  that 
gives  conﬁdence  that  this  is  the  right  approach.

Making �(p) positive enough to be to the right of all poles is then equivalent to making �(ω) 
positive  enough  so  that  the  path  in ω ­space  is  above  all  poles,  in  particular ωi  > �(kv).  For 
real  velocity,  v ,  this  is  precisely  the  condition  ωi  >  0,  we  adopted  before  to  justify  putting 
the  complementary  function  zero. 
Either  approach  gives  the  same  prescription.  It  is  all  bound  up  with  satisfying  causality.

Figure  5.20:  Phase  distance  traveled  in  time  t. 

This  integrand  becomes  small  (and  oscillatory)  for  Δω t �  1.  Physically,  this  means  that 
if particle moves  through many wavelengths  its energy gain  is  small.  Dominant contribution 
is  from  Δω t < π .  These  are  particles  that  move  through  less  than  1  wavelength  during  the 
2 
period  under  consideration.  These  are  the  resonant  particles. 

Figure  5.21:  Dominant  contribution 

Particles moving  slightly  faster  than  wave  are  slowed  down.  This  is  a  second­order  eﬀect. 

Figure  5.22:  Particles moving  slightly  faster  than  the  wave. 

Some  particles  of  this  v0  group  are  being  accelerated  (A)  some  slowed  (B).  Because  A’s  are

then going faster, they spend less time in the ‘down’ region.  B’s are slowed;  they spend more

time  in  up  region.  Net  eﬀect:  tendency  for  particle  to move  its  speed  toward  that  of  wave.

Particles  moving  slightly  slower  than  wave  are  speeded  up.  (Same  argument).  But  this  is

only  true  for  particles  that  have  “caught  the  wave”.

Summary:  Resonant  particles’  velocity  is  drawn  toward  the  wave  phase  velocity. 

Is  there  net  energy  when  we  average  both  slower  and  faster  particles?  Depends  which  type

has most.

plasma.  Strictly,  just  for  electron  plasma  waves. 

How  does  this  apply  to  the  general magnetized  plasma  case  with multiple  species?

Doing  a  complete  evaluation  of  the  dielectric  tensor  using  kinetic  theory  is  feasible  but  very

heavy  algebra.  Our  direct  intuitive  calculation  gives  the  correct  answer more  directly.

The  proof  of  this  fact  is  simple  but  instructive.  Rate  of  doing  work  on  plasma  per  unit

Notation  is  that E(k, ω)  is  amplitude  of wave which  is  really �(E(k, ω) exp i(k.x − ω t))  and 
similarly  for  j.  Whenever  products  are  taken:  must  take  real  part  ﬁrst.  So

The terms e2iφ  & e−2iφ  are rapidly varying.  We usually average over at  least a period.  These

Whole  calculation  can  be  followed  through  replacing  m(−iω)  with  m(ν − iω)  everywhere.

This  introduces  complex  quantity  in  S, D, P .

We  shall  not  bother  with  this  because  in  fusion  plasmas  collisional  damping  is  usually  neg­

ligible.  See  this  physically  by  saying  that  transit  time  of  a  wave  is

This  is manifestly  Hermitian  if  ω  is  real,  and  then  σ  is  anti­Hermitian.

This  observation  is  suﬃcient  to  show  that  if  the  plasma  is  driven  with  a  steady  wave,  there

is  no  damping,  and  k  does  not  acquire  a  complex  part.

In  this  case,  the  relevant  component  is  Hermitian  (i.e.  real)  if  both  ω  and  k  are  real. 

But  that  just  begs  the  question:  If  ω  and  k  are  real,  then  there’s  no  damping  by  deﬁnition.

So we can’t necessarily detect damping or growth just by inspecting the dieletric tensor form

when  it  depends  on  both  ω  and  k .

Electrostatic  Waves  in  general  have  � =  0  which  is  Hermitian.  So  really  it  is  not  enough  to 

deal with � or χ.  We need to deal with σ = −iω�oχ, which indeed has a Hermitian component

for  the  two­stream  instability  (even  though  χ  is  Hermitian)  because  ω  is  complex.

Both  electron  and  ion  damping  need  to  be  considered  as  possibly  important.

Based  on  our  ﬂuid  treatment we  know  these waves will  have  smal l  phase  velocity  relative  to 

electron  thermal  speed.  Also  cs  is  somewhat  larger  than  the  ion  thermal  speed.
