***** Academic Expectations for Homeworks *****
   1. You are encouraged to do as much as possible of the problem sets on your
      own. This is the most effective way to learn, provided that you are not
      just spending hours and hours stuck.
   2. You are permitted to consult with other students in the course concerning
      points that you don't understand or when you are stuck. However, it is
      recommended that you do not develop a collaborative solution to problems.
      Also it is required that your solutions be written out separately and
      submitted in your own words.
   3. No collaboration or consultation will be permitted on the exams. One good
      reason to get into the habit of doing the work yourself!
   4. You may consult books or journal articles to assist if needed. If you do
      materially use such materials, you should give the reference.
   5. There may, in some cases, be solutions from previous years to problems in
      the homeworks or ones very like them, available from the reading room or
      from more senior students. It is not permitted to use or consult these
      solutions. To do so would invalidate the process of using the homework
      marks as part of the course grade, and disadvantage those who avoided
      such use. Please regard this as a point of academic honour, and avoid the
      practice.
