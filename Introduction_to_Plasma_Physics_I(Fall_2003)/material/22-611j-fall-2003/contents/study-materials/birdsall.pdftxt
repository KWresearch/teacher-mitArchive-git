Xes1 particle in cell simulation code of 

Birdsall and Langdon  

I.H.Hutchinson 

1 	What it does 
The code is a one-dimensional electrostatic code. It moves individual particles according to 
Newton's law in an electric field given by solving Poisson's equations on a mesh. The boundary 
conditions are periodic. Particles that exit the mesh are fed back at the other end. It is 
essentially collisionless, but the finite number of particles means that there is significant noise.  
2 	How to run it 
Type in to the terminal the stuff in fixed width font below: 

1. 	 Log in to athena on a Sun workstation (the only ones for which the program is so 
far compiled). 
2. 	 add 22.611j
3. 	 cd /mit/22.611j/birdsall/xes1/xes1/inp This is the directory where the 

input files live. 

4. 	 xes1 2stream.inp This is just one of the input files you can choose. 
5. 	 Arrange the windows that pop up to your satisfaction. 
6. 	 Start and stop by clicking the xes1 control panel buttons. 
3 	Trying your own experiments 
Copy some input files to your own athena area and edit them. Run xes1 on them and 
watch the results. 
4  	More information 
You can read about the input file format in birdsall/xes1/xes1/doc/es1.ps.
