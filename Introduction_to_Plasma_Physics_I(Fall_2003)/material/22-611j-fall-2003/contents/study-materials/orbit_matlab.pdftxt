Use of Matlab Particle Orbit Demo Code 

Course 22.611j Plasma Learning Aid 

Ian Hutchinson 

1  What is it? 
A simple matlab code which calculates particle orbits in a selection of specified magnetic 
and electric fields. Written by Swedish plasma physicists as a teaching aid. They have 
graciously made it publically available.  

Nothing concerning this code is required for the course. I personally find it less useful 
conceptually than would be optimum, but you might enjoy playing around with it.  
2  How to? 
Type in to the terminal the stuff in fixed width font below: 

1.  Log in to athena 
2.  add 22.611j
3.  cd /mit/22.611j/particle_orbits/jaun
4.  add matlab 
5.  matlab 
6.  In the matlab window that will pop up: spm
7.  Tinker with the buttons and watch the plots. 

Further instructions are in the html file matlab_spm.html in the directory.
