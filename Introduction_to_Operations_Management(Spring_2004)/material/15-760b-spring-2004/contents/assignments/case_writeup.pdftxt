15.760B, Spring 2004 – Prof. Jérémie Gallien 

 
Case Write-Up 
This paper should be written in the form of a memo for a manager to whom you report. In 
preparing this assignment, please adhere to the following guidelines: 
1. Work in groups of three students.  Any exception must be cleared by the professor.   
2. Hand in one paper copy of the case write-up for each group (email attachments will 
not be accepted).  
3. Written assignments are to be turned in at the beginning of class for your section, 
in the classroom, on the day they are due. 
4. Each student should have a personal copy of his/her team write-up for the 
corresponding class discussion. 
5. Written assignments must be less than 1500 words in length, accompanied by up to 
6 supporting exhibits.  This is a firm constraint. 
6. Exhibits should contain specific types of analysis, such as financial analysis, break-
even charts, cost analysis, process-flow analysis, etc.  Exhibits should contain any 
relevant supporting information that is too detailed for the body of the paper.  
Exhibits must not be simply an extension of the text. 
The case write-ups will be graded using the following criteria: 
Analysis 
1. Does the paper contain analysis of the major issues? 
2. Does the analysis incorporate properly the relevant tools? 
3. Are assumptions made in the analysis stated explicitly? 
4. Does the analysis isolate the fundamental causes of problems in the case? 
Recommended Actions 
1. Are the criteria for choosing among alternative recommendations stated? 
2. Are the criteria appropriate? 
3. Is the plan of action integrated in a logical way and linked to the analysis? 
4. Is the action plan specific, complete, and practical? 
5. Is it likely that the recommendations will achieve their intended results? 
Exhibits 
1. Are the analyses in the exhibits done correctly? 
2. Do the exhibits support and add to the text on key points? 
Presentation 
1. Is the paper too long? 
2. Is the presentation of professional quality? 
3. Is the paper logically consistent and effectively structured to sell its 
recommendations?
