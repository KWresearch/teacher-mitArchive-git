Trade-off: Inventory Cost Vs. Service Level 

2002 - Jérémie GallienFrom the Trenches… 

Too much: 
• 
Liz Claiborne experiences "unexpected earnings decline as a 
consequence of 'higher-than-expected excess inventories'” – Ag ns,  
i
Teri. “Liz Claiborne Seems to Be Losing Its Invisible Armor,” 
The Wall Street Journal, July 19
1993. 
“On Tuesday, the network-equipment giant Cisco provided the grisly 
details behind its astonishing $2.25 billion inventory write-off in the 
third quarter” 
News.com, May 9 2001, 
– Barrett, Larry. “Cisco’s $2.25 Billion Mea Culpa,” 
http://cnet.news.com (accessed June 3, 2004). 

• 

Too little: 
• 
IBM struggles with shortages in ThinkPad line due to ineffective 
inventory management – Hays, Laurie. “IBM to Slash Prices Up to 27% on Business 
PCs,” The Wall Street Journal, August 24 1994. 

• 

“Since 1990 we have designated the Department of Defense’s 
management of its inventory, including spare parts, as high risk 
because […] its management systems and procedures were 
ineffective.” 
– US General Accounting Office. “Army Inventory: Parts Shortages Are 
Impacting Operations and Maintenance Effectiveness,” August 2001.

2002 - Jérémie GallienEconomic Order Quantity Model 

• 

Set order size for repetitive ordering process with 
fixed order cost 

•  Trade-off: 
Order size too large (too much average inventory  versus 
) 
– 
Order size too small (too much ordering cost) 
– 

•  Examples: 
Ordering/Inventory replenishment policy; 
– 
Batch size on machine with setup time…

) 
each (purchase + shipment cost  from a foreign vendor; in addition 
each order also costs $500 in customs fees. Assum ng a constant

demand of 400 chips per week and an inventory holding cost of 45%, 
how often would you order?

( 
Ordering too much  waste, salvage value < cost) versus 
– 
Ordering too little (excess demand is lost)

2002 - Jérémie GallienNewsvendor Example 

Based on forecasts and marketing studies you are expecting a tota 
l
lifecycle demand N(60,000;20,000) for a new product due to launch in 
the future. The product has a gross margin of $750 and a 
liquidation/disposal cost (for unsold inventory) of $250. Because of long 
lead-times you must commit orders to supplier for the entire product 
life-cycle now. How much should you order?

•  Set Q as the EOQ solution 
•  Set R 
as the newsboy solution: 
P(DDLT < R) = α 
is a desired service level (e.g. 95%) 

where 

α 

Example (cont’d): 
if weekly demand for 128Mb chips is in fact N(400,80)

2002 - Jérémie Gallien(S,T) Parameters 

“order back to S every T time units” 

•  Set T 
as the EOQ solution divided by the demand rate 
•  Set S 
as the newsboy solution: 

P(DDLTRP < S) = α 

where:

- α 
 
is the desired service level (e.g. 95%) 
-DDLTRP = Demand During Lead-Time and 
Review Period 

2002 - Jérémie GallienSafety Stock Formula 

• 

Under periodic and review systems, safety stock SS 
(under normally distributed demand) is given by: 

SS = k σ 

fractile  depending 
on service level, e.g. 
� k = 1.64 
95% 
� k = 2.32 
99% 
� k = 3.09
