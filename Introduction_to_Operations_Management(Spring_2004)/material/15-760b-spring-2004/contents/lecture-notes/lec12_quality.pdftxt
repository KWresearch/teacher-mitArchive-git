•It is important to understand the rationale for this graph, presenting the 
concept of a (less than perfect) optimal quality level resulting from optimizing 
the sum of the cost of quality (prevention, inspection, etc.) and the cost of 
non quality (internal and external failures). It is in particular very relevant in a 
number of settings where the cost of quality and non-quality is fairly technical 
in nature (in semiconductor fabs for example, cost components of yield on 
one hand and atmosphere purity on the other side) 
•It is also important to understand the limitations of this reasoning: 
•The failure costs are easily underestimated, particularly the external failures (think of 
brand/reputation, lawsuit settlements…); 
•The notion that the cost of quality increases as quality becomes near-perfect is debatable: 
when quality is very high, there may not be a need for inspection anymore; 
•It is also hard to estimate the part of the cost of quality resulting from market response, both 
positive (impact on brand and desirability of product) and negative (think of the cost for 
Microsoft of postponing the release of a software product to get some time to work out the 
bugs: they are clearly making the conscious calculation that this is not worth it); 
•This picture is static and for example does not show clearly what the competition’s reaction 
could become (this would drastically increase the cost of non-quality); 
•The notion of an accepted level of defects may also have perverse incentive effects and 
cultural impact on the organization; 
•Finally, unlike the EOQ which is a robust model (change in the values of the input data have 
relatively little effect on the output), this one does not seem to be robust – the cost of non-
quality may for example abruptly jump up by several million dollars for a very little reduction 
in quality level, if that reduction happened to result in a catastrophic external failure 
(Firestone tires of the Ford explorer, Challenger & Columbia shuttles, etc…).

Productivity = 

Production Output ($ created) 
Production Input ($ consumed) 

Materials + Direct Labor + Indirect Labor + Capital + Service

•The point made of this slide (and the previous one with the automotive 
industry benchmark) is that there is not necessarily an inverse relationship 
between productivity and quality. 
•The numerator of the ratio defining productivity tend to increase with quality, 
because of positive market response. 
•The denominator may actually decrease with higher quality, because all of 
its terms (materials, direct labobr, etc. as listed above) have a cost 
component (scrap, rework, etc…) that increases with poor quality. 
•This type of reasoning along with the critique of the optimal quality level 
illustrated in the slide “Cost of Quality” gives rise to the motto “Quality is 
Free” (the title of a book written by Crosby, one of the recognized american 
quality “gurus”).

W. E. Deming advocated that the SQC tools 
be known by everybody in the organization:


1.  Pareto Analysis 
2.  Process Flow Chart

3.  Fishbone Diagrams 

4.  Histograms 
5.  Control Charts 
6.  Scatter Plots

•	 Consider a product made of 100 components 

•	 Assume a defect rate (AQL) of 1% on each 

component

•	 The defect rate on the product is: 

(3.8σ)  P(defect) = 1 – (0.99)100  = 63% ! 

(6σ)  P(defect) = 1 – (0.9999996)100  = 3.4ppm !

•This slide illustrates the result obtained when an experiment was performed 
in order to improve a process, say by varying one of the control levers or 
input. 
•When the process capability is tight, it is much easier tell apart a special 
cause (in this case the variation of the input or process control value) from a 
random fluctuation that could have occurred regardless of the change in the 
input. 
•So performing continuous improvement and process learning is much 
quicker when the capability is high.

•  Large Volume or Costly Defects 
•  Connected Components 
•  Robustness to Process Shift 
•  Tolerance Buildup 
•  Easier to Learn Process Improvements
