Product Definition


•  Product Type (Good or Service) 

•  Strategic Positioning 

•  Product Architecture 

2002 - Jérémie Gallien 

Service Vs. Manufacturing Operations


•  Intangibility (Explicit and Implicit) 
“We manufacture perfume; we sell Hope” 
PERCEPTION Vs. EXPECTATION, ADVERTISE & MATERIALIZE 
•  Perishability (no inventory buffer) 
Can’t inventory seating room! 
CAPACITY PLANNING/FLEXIBILITY, PREVENTION/CULTURE 
•  Heterogeneity (supply and demand variability) 
Consider medical service delivery! 
HIRING, TRAINING, PLANNING, CUSTOMIZATION 
•  Simultaneity (of production and consumption) 
No safety nets for quality problems… 
HIRING, TRAINING, HR, PLANNING, CONCURRENT ENGINEERING
