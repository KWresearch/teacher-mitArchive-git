Class 9: Production Control 

Production Control determines: 

TIME 

QUALITY 

COST 

FLEXIBILITY 

•  When work is performed 
What work is performed 
• 
•  Who performs work 

Production Control is the nervous system 
of a business process 

 

2002 - Jérémie GallienKey Definitions


•	 Pull:  Work triggered by downstream 
(possibly internal) demand 
•	 Push:  Work triggered by a forecast of 
demand 

•	 Make-To-Order:  Work performed towards 
an existing (external) customer order 
•	 Make-To-Stock:  Work performed for a yet 
unknown customer

2002 - Jérémie GallienMRP Problems


•	 Deterministic model 
•	 Large data requirements and GIGO

•	 Self-fulfilling lead-times 
•	 Difficulty and cost of installation and 
maintenance 
•	 Centralized command and control mindset
