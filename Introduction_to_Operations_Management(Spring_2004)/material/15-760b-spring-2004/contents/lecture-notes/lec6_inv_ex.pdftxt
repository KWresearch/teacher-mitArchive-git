(R,Q) Parameters 
“order Q whenever inventory reaches R” 

•  Set Q as the EOQ solution 
•  Set R 
as the newsboy solution: 
P(DDLT < R) = α 
is a desired service level (e.g. 95%) 
where 
α 
DDLT = Demand During Lead Time 

Example (cont’d): 
if weekly demand for 128Mb chips is in fact N(400,80) 
and delivery time is 2 weeks, for a 95% service level: 

Q = 1,013 units (as before), 
] 
R = E[DDLT + 1.65 x  [DDLT] = 800 + 1.65 x sqrt(2) x 80 = 986

“order back to S every T time units” 

•  Set T 
as the EOQ solution divided by the demand rate 
•  Set S 
as the newsboy solution: 
P(DDLTRP < S) = α 
is the desired service level (e.g. 95%) 
 
- α 
-DDLTRP = Demand During Lead-Time and 
Review Period 

where:

Example (cont’d): 

For the 128Mb chips example (from slides 12 & 23): 

T 
S 

= Q   D = 1,013 / 400 = 2.5 weeks, 
/
= E[DDLTRP + 1.65 x 
] 
σ[DDLTRP] 
= (
400 x 4.5 + 1.65 x sqrt(4.5) x 80 = 2080 units 
)
