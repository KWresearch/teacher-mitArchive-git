2002 - Jérémie GallienTypical Questions


•	 How many machines should be purchased? 
•	 How many workers should be hired? 
•	 Consequences of a 20%  increase in demand?

•	 How many counters should be opened to 
maintain customer wait below 10 minutes? 
•	 How many assembly stations are needed to 
maintain backorders below 20?

λi 

µi

For each process step i, determine: 

•  λi 

: demand or input rate (in units of work per unit 
of time) 

•  µi 

: realistic maximum service rate, assuming no 
idle time (in units of work per unit of time) 

ρi  = λi  / µi 

: capacity utilization 

λi - µi 

: build-up rate

2002 - Jérémie GallienManaging the Psychology of 

Queueing 


1. 	 Unoccupied time feels longer than occupied time

2. 	 Process waits feel longer than in process waits 
3. 	 Anxiety makes waits seem longer 
4. 	 Uncertain waits seem longer than known, finite 
waits 
5. 	 Unexplained waits are longer than explained

6. 	 Unfair waits are longer than equitable waits

7. 	 The more valuable the service, the longer the 
customer will wait 
8. 	 Solo waits feel longer than group waits
