Simulation Performance Drivers


•	 Proactive Vs. Reactive Strategy: this is what 
models allow!!! 
•	 Extent of quantitative analysis does have an 
impact BUT describing qualitatively the 
correct trade-offs brings you a long way… 
•	 Understanding financial impact of 
operational data (lead time, utilization, 
queues, etc…) had a huge impact!
