1.  	 BEWARE OF INTEL INSIDE 
(Regardless of your industry) 
2. 	 MAKE/BUY IS NOT ABOUT WHETHER IT IS 
TWO CENTS CHEAPER OR TWO DAYS FASTER 
TO OUTSOURCE VERSUS INSOURCE. 
3.  DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIP DESIGN CAN 
DETERMINE THE FATE OF COMPANIES AND 
INDUSTRIES, AND OF PROFIT AND POWER 
4.  THE LOCUS OF VALUE CHAIN CONTROL 

CAN SHIFT IN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS


VALUE CHAIN DESIGN:

Three Components 
1. Insourcing/OutSourcing 
(The Make/Buy or Vertical Integration Decision)

2. Partner Selection
(Choice of suppliers and partners for the chain)


3. The Contractual Relationship
(Arm’s length, joint venture, long-term contract, 
strategic alliance, equity participation, etc.)

ARCHITECTURES IN 3-D

INTEGRALITY VS. MODULARITY


27  

Integral product architectures feature 

close coupling among the elements
- Elements perform many functions

- Elements are in close spacial proximity

- Elements are tightly synchronized

- Ex:  jet engine, airplane wing, microprocessor

Modular product architectures feature 

separation among the elements
- Elements are interchangeable 

- Elements are individually upgradeable

- Element interfaces are standardized

- System failures can be localized

- Ex:  stereo system,  desktop PC, bicycle


VALUE CHAIN ARCHITECTURE


28  

Integral value-chain architecture 
features close proximity among its elements 
- Proximity metrics:  	Geographic, Organizational 

Cultural, Electronic 

- Example:  Toyota city  

- Example:  Ma Bell (AT&T in New Jersey)

- Example:  IBM mainframes & Hudson River Valley  

Modular value-chain architecture features multiple, 
interchangeable supplier and standard interfaces 
- Example:  Garment industry 
- Example:  PC industry 
- Example:  General Motors’ global sourcing 
- Example:  Telephones and telephone service

Demand-Supply Chain Management  

@ Dell


  Demand Management: 
Forecast = Buy = Sell 
 
  Buy to Plan, but Build to Order 

•  Inventory Velocity is a wonderful thing …

• Customers  have immediate access to the latest 
technology. 
• Suppliers  get their products to market quickly 

• Quality  is improved with fewer touches. 
• Cash  is generated through negative cash cycle.

•  Model efficiencies drive Market Share gain. 

Can  “Dell Direct”Work for Autos?


31  

• Appealing to OEM’s on Many  

Dimensions

– Satisfy customer need for Speed

–Reduce Supply Line Inventories

–Reduce mismatches and 

discounting 
–Direct OEM-Customer Relationships 
(& Data!) 
– Information Transparency

-Defense aircraft 
-Automobiles 
-Handheld electronic organizers/communicators 
-Music 
What are the key elements in the value chain? 
What are the key dynamic processes 
influencing power in the chain? 
What are the key dependency relationships in the value chain? 
What is driving the clockspeed in the chain? 
What are the opportunities for outsourcing ? 
What are the windows of opportunity in the chain?
