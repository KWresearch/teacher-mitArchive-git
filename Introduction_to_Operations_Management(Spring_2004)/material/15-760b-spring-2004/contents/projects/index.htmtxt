***** Simulation Exercise *****
Teams of three students will manage a virtual factory in a Web-based simulation
exercise for about one week. The goal of this assignment is to letÂ them adapt
and apply concepts from the class in a managerial situation; it will also
giveÂ them a chance to formalize their own decision models and test their
relevance and effectiveness. After the simulation is over, each team will turn
in a written report of at mostÂ four pages containing:
   1. Description of the strategy that was followed, with a detailed
      explanation of its underlying rationale (description of all quantitative
      models or reasoning used to come up with this strategy);
   2. Assessment of its performance;
   3. A posteriori suggestions for improving your performance in this
      simulation;
   4. Description of the most important lessons you learned or insights you
      gained.
This team exercise is worth 30% of a student's grade: 20% for the report, and
10% for the simulation performance. Experience demonstrates that advance
planning and sound use of quantitative models provide key competitive
advantages in this game.
Littlefield Technology Simulation Exercise: Assignment Description
**** Questions ****
Answers to these questions should be included in the group's simulation write-
up:
   1. Describe the strategy that you followed and provide a detailed
      explanation of its underlying rationale (in particular, description of
      all quantitative models used to come up with this strategy).
   2. Assess your team's performance throughout the simulation.
   3. A posteriori, what could you have done differently to improve your
      performance in this simulation?
   4. (Provide supporting quantitative models and explain your reasoning/
      rational as appropriate).
   5. Describe any lessons you learned or insights you gained in this exercise.
