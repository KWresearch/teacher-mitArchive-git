***** Course Objective *****
Our objective in this course is to introduce concepts and techniques related to
the design, planning, control, and improvement of both manufacturing and
service operations.
In particular, some of the topics covered include: process description, flow
diagrams, capacity analysis, capacity ROI, cycle time analysis, inventory
management, delayed postponement, production control, work coordination, risk
pooling, quality management, process design and reengineering, product
development, project management, procurement, make vs. buy and supply chain
design.
The course relies on a combination of case discussions,Â lectures,Â readings,
andÂ assignments. To pursue the course objective most effectively, students
will have to:
   1. Prepare the assigned cases, readings, exercises, and discuss them in
      class;
   2. Prepare a written analysis of one case;
   3. Prepare a one page review of the book The Goal by Eliyahu Goldratt; and
   4. Manage a virtual plant in a simulation exercise and prepare a written
      report on this experience.
***** Academic Integrity *****
Our general policy for this class is that when preparing cases and assignments
students should not benefit from anyone who has already participated in a
faculty-lead discussion of the same material, at Sloan or at another school. In
addition, they should work alone when preparing graded individual assignments,
and when preparing graded team assignments, discussions should be strictly
limited to the members of your team. When preparing any graded assignment,
studentsÂ may not consult or use material not already included in the course
packet or posted on the course webpage, unless this has been explicitly
authorized by the instructor.
The academic integrity policy of this course will be enforced, and any
violators would expose themselves to the most serious consequences (a couple of
years ago several students were not awarded a degree in June because of what
they had done in 15.760). In addition, students will be held personally
responsible for confronting and reporting any violations that would come to
your attention. Finally, if at any point during the course the implications of
this academic integrity policy on your particular situation are not completely
clear, immediately contact the instructor.
Note that this policy implies in particular thatÂ students should:
    * Never, ever ask for/obtain/use hints or material relative to an
      assignment from any student or alumni who has already taken the class;
    * Never, ever perform a search on the internet to find information relative
      to a graded assignment without the explicit authorization of the
      instructor.
***** Grading and Assignments *****
The grading of 15.760 will be based on the following weighting scheme:
ACTIVITIES                       PERCENTAGES
Class Participation (Individual) 30%
Case Write-up (Team)             30%
Book Review (Individual)         10%
Simulation (Team)                30% (20% Report, 10% Simulation Performance)
**** Class Participation ****
Class participation will be determined on the basis ofÂ a student'sÂ comments
in each class session, including discussions of the non-graded assignments and
readings. We are highly biased towards comment quality as opposed to comment
quantity.
In a typical session, one or more students will be asked to begin each
discussion by addressing specific questions.Â If you have thoroughly prepared
the case or reading, you should have no difficulty in handling such a lead-off
request.Â After a few minutes of initial analysis and recommendations, the
discussion will be opened to the rest of the class. As a group, we will try to
build a complete analysis of the situation and address the problems and issues
it presents.
Most managers spend very little time reading and even less time writing
reports. This is especially true for managers in operations-intensive settings.
For this reason, the classroom should be considered a laboratory in which you
can test your ability to present your analyses and recommendations clearly, to
convince your peers of the correctness of your approach to complex problems,
and to illustrate your ability to achieve the desired results through the
implementation of that approach.Â 
Some of the criteria that we will use to judge effective class participation
include:
   1. Is the participant a good listener?
   2. Is the participant concise and articulate?
   3. Are the points made relevant to the current discussion? Are they linked
      to the comments of others?
   4. Do the comments show clear evidence of appropriate and insightful
      analysis of the case?
   5. Is there a willingness to participate?

***** Miscellaneous *****
    * We ask that students put out a name card in every class.
    * Please refrain from using laptops in the classroom.
    * There are only 19 class sessions in this course. We consider this the
      minimum required to cover the essentials of operations management. Other
      demands may require you to miss a class, but you should not have more
      than one such absence. It is difficult to receive a passing grade in
      15.760 without regular attendance.
    * Please be prepared for every class.Â Students should let the instructor
      know before class if an emergency has made it impossible for you to
      prepare adequately. In these situations we still encourage you to attend.
      We would rather you attend unprepared than not at all.
