INTRODUCTION

The Orbiter cockpit is less advanced than modern aircraft 
cockpits despite a substantial upgrade in 2000 

Design Requirements 
•  Normal operation with only two seated pilots (excluding payloads) 
•  Return capability with only one pilot 
•  Crew selection of manual or automated functions 
•  Exterior and interior lighting for visibility 

Original  “CRT-
Mechanical” Cockpit 
Designed in 1970s 

Multifunction Electronic 
Display System (MEDS) 
First flown in 2000 

Cockpit Avionics 
Upgrade Program (CAU) 
Cancelled in 2004

INTRODUCTION 
The cockpit satisfies its original requirements but still has 
human factors problems

OBSTACLES TO DEVELOPMENT 
Budget cuts (1970s, 2004) 

Lack of computer power 

Difficulty in space-qualifying 
hardware and software 

Astronauts’ reluctance to 
complain (for fear of losing 
flight assignments) 

Impending Shuttle retirement 
in 2010

CURRENT PROBLEMS 
High workload, especially 
during emergency situations 

– 

– 

underutilized LCD displays 

difficult fault diagnosis 

Cluttered cockpit layout 

Poor situational awareness 

Insufficient “human centered” 
automation? 

Poor human factors design – by today’s standards

CONSIDERATIONS FOR REDESIGN

The Cockpit Avionics Upgrade (CAU) is a first step in

resolving these deficiencies 
CURRENT PROBLEMS 
COCKPIT AVIONICS UPGRADE 
Increased

CONSIDERATIONS FOR REDESIGN 
The automation should be more human-centered but still 
allow for full manual control 
Level of Automation 
Recommended 
•  Improved fault diagnosis 
software and display 
techniques 
•  Flight computers recommend 
and/or prioritize several 
possible actions 
Depends on mission and payload 
•  No change to current system 
•  Autopilot entry 
BUT landing autopilot should 
•  Manual, fly-by-wire final 
be flight-tested at least once 
approach and landing; backup 
landing autopilot* 

Current 
•  Autopilot for nominal ascent 
•  Cryptic Caution and Warning 
System 
•  No automation during 
emergencies 

Ascent

In Orbit 

Entry and 
Landing 

Pilots should ALWAYS have final control authority 

Note: * Has never been flight tested

CONSIDERATIONS FOR REDESIGN 
Other proven technologies could further improve situational 
awareness and reduce spatial disorientation 

General Aviation Display Technology 

Highway-in-the-Sky, Synthetic Vision 

Haptic feedback garments 

3D audio, voice recognition

CEV CONSIDERATIONS 
The CEV will have a more advanced and less cluttered 
cockpit than the Orbiter 

DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS 
•  Implement CAU suggestions 
•  Simpler cockpit layout 
•  Increased computing capabilities 
•  Higher level of human-centered 
automation 
- autonomous docking 
- subsystem health monitoring 
- reduced dependence on

Mission Control 


30-35 years more advanced 
than Orbiter 

7 

•  Ballistic, capsule-type 
spacecraft like the Apollo 
Command Module 
•  Ground and water landing 
capabilities 
•  Longer duration missions to 
the Moon and Mars 

Summary and Conclusions 

•  The current Orbiter cockpit meets the original design requirements; 
however, it is not optimal from a human factors perspective 
•  In our redesign, we suggest 
–  implementing the Cockpit Avionics Upgrade program 
–  increasing the human-centered automation to reduce workload 
but always allowing the pilot to have final authority 
–  using proven cockpit technologies to improve situational

awareness and reduce spatial disorientation

•  general aviation technologies, highway-in-the-sky, synthetic vision 
•  haptic feedback, voice recognition, 3D audio 
•  These improvements can also be applied to the CEV cockpit
