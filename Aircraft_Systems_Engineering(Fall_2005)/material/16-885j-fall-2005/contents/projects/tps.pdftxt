Performance Summary 

  Overall, measured surface 
temperatures lower than 
requirement, and lower 
than predicted 
  Some areas of excessive 
tile-to-tile heating (gap 
filler fix) 

  Excellent mechanical performance 
Test phase: no tiles from underneath detached, small amount of 
 
damage to tiles, some LRSI tiles fell off 
  Recommend similar system (SIP, RTV) for future designs
