Crew Exploration Vehicle


	 A blunt body capsule is the safest, most 
affordable and fastest approach 
•	 Separate Crew Module and Service Module configuration 
•	 Vehicle designed for lunar missions with 4 crew 
  Can accommodate up to 6 crew for Mars and Space Station missions 
•	 System also has the potential to deliver pressurized and unpressurized 
cargo to the Space Station if needed 

	 5.5 meter diameter capsule 
scaled from Apollo 
•	 Significant increase in volume 
•	 Reduced development time and risk 
•	 Reduced reentry loads, increased landing stability and better crew visibility

Servicing the International Space Station


	 NASA will invite industry to offer

commercial crew and cargo

delivery service to and from the 

Station 


	 The CEV will be designed for 
lunar missions 

but, if needed, can service the 
International Space Station. 

	 The CEV will be able to transport 
crew to and from the station and 
stay for 6 months 

12 

Launch Systems 

 Continue to rely upon the existing U.S. expendable
launch vehicle fleet for robotic missions

 For human missions, the safest, most reliable and most
affordable launch system will be one derived from the
Space Shuttle systems
• Capitalizes on human-rated systems and 85% of existing
facilities
• The most straightforward growth path to later exploration super
heavy lift needs

 100 metric tons+ lift capacity required to minimize on-
orbit assembly and complexity – increasing mission
success
• A clean-sheet-of-paper design is too expensive and risky
• Super heavy lift derived from EELV increases complexity,
increases cost and decreases overall safety/reliability
• Current Shuttle system already lifts 100 metric tons to orbit on
every launch
 80 metric tons is the Orbiter

Our Destiny is to Explore!


	 The goals of our future space flight program must be worthy of the 
expense, difficulty and risks which are inherent to it. 

	 We need to build beyond our current capability to ferry astronauts 
and cargo to low Earth orbit. 

	 Our steps should be evolutionary, incremental and cumulative. 

	 To reach for Mars and beyond we must first reach for the Moon. 

A committed and long term lunar effort is needed, and we 
need to begin that investment now! 

21 

	 The human imperative to explore and settle new lands will be satisfied, by others if not 
by us.  Humans will explore the Moon, Mars, and beyond.  It's simply a matter of which 
humans, when, what values they will hold, and what languages they will speak, what 
cultures they will spread.  What the United States gains from a robust program of 
human space exploration is the opportunity to carry the principles and values of 
western philosophy and culture along on the absolutely inevitable outward migration of 
humanity into the solar system and, eventually, beyond.  These benefits are tangible and 
consequential.  It matters what the United States chooses to do, or not to do, in space. 

	

It is our nation’s privilege and obligation to lead yet another opportunity to explore 
places beyond our own, and to help shape the destiny of our world for centuries to 
come.  We in our generation are uniquely privileged to be given the challenge of 
initiating a visionary program of exploration and discovery on behalf of the American 
people and the world. 

Mike Griffin, AIAA speech,  9/2005  

22 

The United States must lead the expansion of the space 
frontier to continue to maintain our world leadership role, 
and for the security of the nation. 

Great nations do great and ambitious things. We must

continue to be great.
