ASSURRED ACCESS: “THE BUREAUCRATIC SPACE WAR" 

E. C. Pete Aldridge, Jr.

The Policy Mistake 

The United States made  a  tragic  policy  decision  in  the  late  1970’s when 
President  Jimmy  Carter  decided  that  the  Space  Shuttle  would  be  the 
exclusive  means  for  the  United  States  to  launch  satellites  into  space.1 
Th is   dec is ion   was   based   on   h igh ly   op t im is t ic   da ta   on   the   cos t  
effectiveness  of  the  Shuttle  over  the  unmanned  expendable  launch 
vehicles  (ELV)  being  used  at  the  time.  The  information  presented  to  the 
President was that: 
--the Shuttle would cost about one-third the cost of the 
expendable launch vehicles with comparable payload capacity; 
--the Shuttle could be ready for a reflight only after seven days of 
maintenance  and  check-out,  resulting  in  a  flight  rate  of  about  55 
launches per year for the entire Shuttle fleet; and 
--all  five  Shuttles  to  be  built  would  be  identical  and  would  have 
performance capability sufficient to fly the largest US payloads. 

There  were,  however,  those  in  the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  who 
were  skeptical  about  these  performance  estimates  and  who  were 
worried  about  the  “Shuttle  only”  space  launch  policy.  They  were 
overruled  by  those  in  the  Pentagon  in  leadership  positions  who  were 
conv inced   tha t   the   on ly   way   tha t   Congress   wou ld   approve   the  
development of the Shuttle would be to tie the Shuttle to the imperatives 
of  launching  payloads  essential  to  the  security  of  the United  States.  In 
addition, even  the skeptics  thought  that  if only  the  flight cost estimates 
came  true,  the  cost  savings  could  be  put  back  into  the  military  space 
program  in  the  form of  improved satellites, on-orbit satellite spares and 
enhanced  reliability and on-orbit  lifetime. Their  fears about having only 
a single launch vehicle would be offset by having a more redundant and 
capable satellite system for a variety of military missions

The  first  Shuttle,  Columbia,  was  planned  to  be  launched  from  Kennedy 
Spaceflight Center  (KSC)  in  1979.  To  hedge  against  the  uncertainties  of 
Shu t t le   per formance   or   re l iab i l i ty ,   the   p lan   was   to   ma in ta in   the  
production of expendable  launch vehicles  to back up  the Shuttle  for  two 
years  after  the  first  launch  from  KSC.  In  the  meantime,  satellites  were 
being  redesigned  to  take  advantage  of  the  larger  cargo  volume  and 
weight  that  the  Shuttle  offered.  In  addition,  since  the  price  charged  by 
the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA)  to  launch 
satellites  was  based  on  the  length  of  the  cargo  bay  they  occupied, 
satellites tended to become wider and shorter, filling the 15 foot width of 
the Shuttle bay. This also had a profound and direct impact on the future 
of  the  launch  vehicle  business---satellites  were  becoming  larger  and 
heavier  than  the  current  class of ELVs  could  lift. Congress making  sure 
DOD  had  no  way  out,  stated  that  they  would  not  approve  of  any  future 
DOD satellite unless it was designed exclusively to fly in the Shuttle.2 

The Shuttle Flies--And America Cheers 

Columbia’s  first  flight  did  not  occur  until  April  1981,  three  months  into 
the  Reagan  Administration.  The  flight  was  a  remarkable  national  and 
international  success.  In  spite  of  the  delay,  all  Americans,  and  indeed 
people  all  over  the  world,  felt  pride  in  America  and  her  technological 
achievement. The  intensity of  this pride was particularity great since  the 
US  was  just  beginning  to  exit  a  period  of  the  late  1970’s  that  was 
embarrassing to the status, power and prestige of the country. 

The Shuttle was supposedly declared “operational” by the fourth flight in 
July  1982.  President Reagan  attended  the  Ianding  at  Edwards Air  Force 
Base, California, on July 4, 1982 and announced his  first National Space 
Policy.3  In  that  policy  he  noted  that  the  “Space  Transportation  System” 
would  be  the  primary  US  national  launch  system  and  he  called  for 
expansion  of  the  private  sector  involvement  and  investment  in  civil 
space and related activities. 

In  reality,  major  support  problems  plagued  the  Shuttle  program.  These 
problems were  primarily  the  lack  of  spare  parts  and  technical  problems 
which  caused  long  reflight  preparation  times.  The  real  costs  to  launch 
the Shuttle were becoming apparent and low launch

rates  forced  these  large overhead  costs  to be spread over  fewer  flights. 
While  the  original  plan  called  for  each  of  five  orbiters  to  be  essentially 
iden t ica l ,   in   rea l i ty   each   o f   the   orb i ters   were   d i f feren t   and   the  
performance  of  each was  substantially  below  the  design  specifications. 
NASA had promised that each orbiter would 65,000 pounds of payload to 
low earth orbit  from Kennedy Center and 32,000 pounds  to a polar orbit4 
from  Vandenberg  AFB,  California.  The  final  Shuttle  capabilities  were 
nearly 20% short of these goals. 

Since  DOD  had  committed  satellite  designs  to  take  advantage  of  the 
promised  weight  and  volume  capabilities  of  the  Shuttle,  two  upgrade 
programs  had  to  be  developed  by NASA--a  filament wound  case  for  the 
Shuttle  solid  rocket  motors  and  an  improvement  to  the  Shuttle  main 
engines  permitting  them  to  perform  at  a  higher  thrust.  Both  of  these 
performance  upgrades would  be  demonstrated with  the  first  flight  from 
Vandenberg AFB, with Discovery, planned for July 1986. 

Even  though  the  cost,  performance  and  flight  rate  problems  with  the 
Shuttle were of concern  to DOD,  there was still some optimism  that  they 
would  be  overcome.  In  March  1983,  in  testimony  before  the  House 
Subcommittee  on  Space  Science  and  Application,  the  Air  Force,  the 
executive  agent  for  DOD’s  Shuttle  launch  operations  continued  to 
express optimism about  the Shuttle.5  Indeed,  it would be very difficult at 
this  point  to  show  any  concern  over  a  program  that  was  receiving  so 
much  praise  and  admiration  from  Americans  and  the  world  public. 
However, the Air Force, somewhat meekly, outlined a “Back-up Strategy” 
for  the  Shuttle.  If  the  sixth  Shuttle  flight  was  successful,  the  Air  Force 
would not proceed with  the procurement of  the  17th  and  18th Titan  34D 
currently in the budget and would terminate the existing Titan production 
line--the "workhorse" of the DOD space launchers--at the end of the year. 
The  Air  Force  noted  that  there  were  offers  from  the  aerospace  to 
“commercialize”  the  existing  Titan,  Atlas  and  Delta  expendable  launch 
vehicles and  to use  the current government-owned  facilities and  ranges 
for this purpose. The Air Force believed that 

4A polar orbit is defined as an orbit around the earth in which the satellite 
ground  trace would  come  close  to  each  pole  of  the  earth  on  each  orbit. 
" 
These orbits have also been called "high inclination  orbits.

this  idea  was  worthy  of  study  since,  if  implemented  the  government 
would not have to pay for a natural backup to the Shuttle. 

The Optimism Fades 

A  series  of  events  In  the  Summer  of  1983  began  to  seriously  erode  the 
optimism  of  the  Air  Force  and  many  in  DOD  about  the  ability  of  the 
Shuttle  to  be  the  exclusive  US  space  launch  vehicle.  The  real  costs  to 
launch the Shuttle were more apparent, and more visible to NASA and to 
the  Congress.  In  an  internal memorandum,  the  Deputy  Administrator  of 
NASA admitted that “During the 1970’s, NASA inflated the mission model 
far  beyond  any  realistic  limits  in  order  to  reduce  the  apparent  cost  per 
flight  of  the  Shuttle.  In  fact,  the  mission  model  used  to  arrive  at  the 
agreement with DOD, was developed by NASA in the mid 1970’s and was 
designed solely  to push  the cost of Shuttle  flights below  that of  the cost 
of  expendable  launch  vehicles.”6  The  realities  of  this  statement  had 
become obvious. 

Congressional  pressure  on  NASA  about  the  cost  of  Shuttle  operations 
was  forcing  consideration  of DOD  paying  for  the  upgrades  to  reach  the 
original  performance  levels  promised,  to  pay  a  higher  flight  charge  to 
NASA,  and  even  to  pay  for  the  procurement  of  an  additional  orbiter. 
There  was  also  discussions  in  the  Administration  to  direct  NASA  to 
increase  the  Shuttle  flight  charges  to  non-government  users  so  as  to 
recover  some  of  the  real  flight  costs.  However,  NASA  and  many  in 
Congress  thought  that  this  “full  cost  recovery”  policy  would  drive 
commercial  satellite  users  off  the  Shuttle  to  “commercial”  expendable 
launch  vehicles,  primarily  foreign,  and  thus  raise  the  cost  per  flight  for 
DOD payloads even more. The cost issue was also causing some friction 
among NASA and Air Force personnel working the interface between the 
Shuttle  and  future DOD payloads. As  the  real  launch  cost of  the Shuttle 
was becoming known, NASA started moving costs, previously agreed  to 
be  borne  by  the  Shuttle  and  included  in  the  “standard”  Shuttle  flight 
cost,  over  to  the  payload  “user”,  in  this  case  the  Air  Force.  This  was 
particularly frustrating to the Air Force since these new costs had

to   be   absorbed   from   budgets   a lready   approved   by   the   A ir   Force  
leadership and the Congress.7 

Performance of  the orbiter,  in  terms of  the amount of payload  that could 
be  delivered  to  low  earth  orbit  had  also  been  reduced.  The  total  empty 
weight  of  the  Shuttle  was  larger  than  originally  expected,  resulting  in 
lower  payload  capacity,  reduced  cross  range maneuverability  and more 
stringent  demands  on  launch  abort  procedures.  In  addition,  NASA  was 
requiring  more  liftoff  weight  margin,  thus  further  reducing  payload 
weight. 

The  Shuttle  continued  to  raise  doubts  that  the  projected  flight  rates 
would  ever  be  achieved.  The  first  problem  was  that  instead  of  five 
orbiters,  only  four  had  been  built.  Furthermore,  the  Shuttle  turnaround 
time, projected to be seven days, was actually closer to sixty days. Also, 
it  required  in  excess  of  6,000  people,  which  was  nearly  four  times  the 
expected  number. With  this  recycle  time  each  orbiter  could  only  fly  six 
times  a  year,  resulting  in  a  maximum  flight  rate  for  the  fleet  of  four 
orbiters of 24  flights per year. There was a concern  that  if any problems 
occurred, the combined demand for flights by DOD, commercial and civil 
users  would  not  be  achieved.  This  condition  could  result  in  DOD  being 
close  to  the exclusive user of  the Shuttle, with  the  total cost being born 
by DOD, or DOD payloads would be delayed in order to launch important 
scientific  payloads.  Neither  of  these  options  were  acceptable  to  the  Air 
Force or DOD. 

These  concerns  continued  to  grow  during  the  later  part  of  1983. But  on 
December  27,  1983,  the  Air  Force  presented  a  classified  briefing  to  the 
Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  outlining  a  “Net 
Assessment”  of  US  and  Soviet  space  capabilities.8  A  key  part  of  this 
presentation  was  a  comparison  of  the  space  launch  capabilities  of  the 
two  nations  and  a  description  of  the  concerns  about  the  “Shuttle  only” 
policy of the US. In a meeting with the Secretary of Defense the next day, 
the Air Force outlined  a plan  to  resolve  the  concerns of  this policy. The 
Secretary agreed with the Air Force plan. 

To  implement  this  plan,  Secretary  Weinberger  sent  a  letter  to  the 
President on January 23, 1984 advising him that DOD and the

Intelligence Community were  concerned  about  the  current  plans  to  rely 
on the Shuttle for sole access to space, and that the country had made a 
“serious  mistake"  in  adopting  this  policy.9  He  recommended  that  a 
l im i ted   numbe r   o f   expendab le   launch   veh ic les   be   p rocu red   to  
complement the Shuttle. He stated that “DOD remains committed to STS. 
Our  limited  use  of  ELVs  will  not  undermine  the  validity  of  the  STS 
program nor will  the effort significantly  increase  the  total cost  to  the US 
government in meeting its essential launch requirements.” 

On February  7,  1984, DOD  issued  the  new DOD Space  Launch Strategy, 
as  outlined  in  the  letter  to  the  President.10  The  key  part  of  that  strategy 
was that the US must possess an ELV capable of launching Shuttle-class 
payloads to geosynchronous orbits. 

The Bureaucratic Space “War” Begins.

NASA,  especially  its Administrator, was  furious. They  thought  that DOD 
had  indicated,  incorrectly,  a  lack  of  confidence  in  the  Shuttle,  and  that 
this  was  “only  a  ploy  of  the  Air  Force  to  abandon  the  Shuttle”11.  With 
DOD  no  longer  a  user,  they  claimed  that  the  cost  to  other  commercial 
and civil users would go up and they too would be less inclined to fly the 
Shuttle. There were even  those  inside DOD who were against  this move, 
not  wanting  to  pay  the  price  for  the  additional  expendable  launch 
vehicles  and  who  believed  the  Shuttle  would  ultimately  achieve  its  full 
potential.  NASA  supporters  in  the  House  and  Senate  also  criticized  the 
Air Force for this plan and called for hearings on the issue. 

The Air Force again appeared before the House Subcommittee on Space 
Science and Applications on February 23, 1984, but  this  time  it  is before 
a much more hostile audience.12  In  the  testimony,  the Air Force outlined 
i ts   need   for   a   comp lemen tary   launch   sys tem   to   hedge   aga ins t  
unforeseen  technical  and  operational  problem  with  the  Shuttle.  They 
stated  that  the DOD was  concerned  that  only  a  four  orbiter  fleet  did  not 
represent an assured, flexible and responsive

access  to  space,  and  that  was  an  unacceptable  national  security  risk. 
The Air Force stated that the solution to this problem must be affordable 
and  effective  and  have  low  technical  risk  and  reasonable  schedule 
availability. They also noted  that unmanned expendable  launch vehicles 
met  these  criteria.  The  DOD  was  studying  the  use  of  commercially 
procured ELVs  to meet  its  requirements, consistent with  the President’s 
encouragement  of  commercial  space  ventures.  They  would  continue  to 
fly  eight  to  ten  missions  a  year  on  the  Shuttle,  but  would  complement 
this  with  two  ELV  flights  per  year.  The  Air  Force  stated  that  the 
advantages of such a plan would be as follows; it would: 

-reduce  DOD  “launch  on  demand”  pressures  on  STS  for  critical 
national security payloads; 
--reduce chances that DOD would preempt other 
important customers flying commercial and 
scientific payloads; 
--permit the Shuttle to continue to be the primary launch means for 
other more routine missions which required 
a man interface; 
--permit  NASA  to  schedule  more  effective  and  more  routine 
multiple payload flights; and 
--extend the life of the four orbiter fleet. 

The Air Force also stated that the decision to pursue the complementary 
launch vehicle program must be made “now”. At the end of that year the 
launch  vehicle  production  lines  would  start  shutting  down  causing  the 
production base to erode. 

NASA  responded  to  the  Air  Force  plan  with  a  memorandum  from  the 
Administrator  to  the  Secretary  of  Defense3,   in   wh ich   he   made   the  
following  arguments:  The  Air  Force  flight  requirements  would  be  met 
with  the Shuttle  and  that  a back-up or  a  complement was not needed.  If 
the Air  Force  felt  compelled  to  have  a Shuttle  complement,  it  should  be 
based  on  components  of  the  Shuttle.  In  this  way  both  the  Air  Force’s 
needs would be met  and  the Shuttle program would benefit  from higher 
component  production  rates.  Lastly,  a  Shuttle  derived  launch  vehicle 
would  have  growth  potential  to meet  future  space  launch  requirements 
of the nation not only the Air Force.

This  debate  put  the  Air  Force  in  a  very  difficult  and  unpopular  position 
since it had to defend its position by stating publicly why it had concerns 
over  placing  exclusive  reliance  on  the  Shuttle  for  space  access.  The 
questions  on  cost,  performance,  turnaround  and  flight  rates  were 
brought to the attention of the public, as well as the concern that the loss 
of one Shuttle would eliminate 25% of the total launch capacity of the US. 

The First “Battle" --Confidence 

As  in  any  “war”  there  are  numerous  battles,  and  this  one  was  no 
exception.  One  of  these  battles  dealt  with  Shuttle  confidence.  NASA 
interpreted  the  Air  Force  defense  of  its  assured  Iaunch  as  a  lack  of 
confidence  in  the  reliability  of  the  Shuttle,  considered  the  Air  Force 
defensive statements as a “slap  in  the  face” of NASA and  the engineers 
and  technicians  who  built  and  launched  the  system.  NASA  stated  that 
nothing  is  “assured”  and  presented  data  showing  that  unmanned 
expendable  launch vehicles were not as  reliable as  the Shuttle, which at 
that point was showing 100% 
reliability.14 

On March 7 1984, those more friendly to DOD interest enter into the fray. 
The  Air  Force  was  called  to  testify  before  the  House  Armed  Services 
Committee, a key oversight committee to DOD’s programs to explain the 
new  Assured  Launch  Strategy.15  The  Air  Force  tried  to  avoid  criticizing 
the Shuttle by noting that  if the Shuttle worked perfectly, the DOD needs 
would be met with the current Shuttle fleet. However, the Air Force noted 
that  things  do  not  perfectly--launch  schedules  change,  unpredictable 
failures  in  spacecraft  occur,  even  on-orbit  success,  requiring  delays  in 
launching replacement satellites, complicate the Shuttle launch planning 
process.  The  Shuttle  was  particularly  sensitive  to  launch  schedule 
changes since each orbiter had  to meet multiple  launches per year. Any 
schedule  changes had  a  “ripple”  effect on  subsequent  launches.  It  also 
became  apparent  that  because  of  the  loss  of  performance,  Atlantis  and 
Discovery  were  the  only  orbiters  capable  of  launching  all  the  DOD 
payloads.

The Air Force,  in an attempt  to pacify  the negative attitude of NASA and 
their Congressional supporters stated  that  the complementary ELV plan 
was  not  a  substitute  for  a  viable  orbiter  fleet.  The  Air  Force  and  DOD 
must have both the Shuttle and the ELV fleet to meet its requirements. 

The  Air  Force  outlined  the  approach  to  implement  its  plan  of  launching 
two ELVs per year,  in addition  to  the Shuttle  launches  it planned  to use. 
The approach called  for  the contractors  to pay  the development cost  for 
a  “commercial”  ELV  capable  of  carrying  Shuttle-sized  payloads,  and 
then  they  would  be  permitted,  to  amortize  these  costs  over  the  total 
number of launch vehicles sold over the 1988-92 period. The government 
would  pay  for  the  total  launch  cost  a  year  in  advance  of  the  launch,  as 
they  had  done  for  the  Shuttle.  Such  an  approach  would  minimize  the 
near-term  cost  to  the  government  and  encourage  industry  to  compete 
with ELVs being developed by foreign countries. 

The  Request  For  Proposal  was  issued  to  industry  by  the  Air  Force  in 
March  1984  to  develop  and  procure  the  complementary  ELV.   During 
March  and  April,  1984  the  Air  Force  leaders  met  with  NASA  staff, 
Congressional staff, Congressmen, Senators and Administration officials 
to “sell” the plan. Nobody was impressed with the plan and, in particular, 
the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget,  the  Executive  Office’s  chief 
financial  spokesman,  did  not  support  the  approach.16   Without  their 
support, there was no chance of Congressional support. 

In  late  June  1984,  the  Air  Force  noted  that  it  had  hoped  that  industry 
would  have  been  able  to  develop  and  build  a  commercially  viable  ELV 
without  a  large  near-term  investment  by  DOD.  “Neither  industry  nor 
Congress were sold on that approach , so we are now planning to pursue 
a  conventional  development  and  procurement  program17.  The  required 
funds  were  included  in  the  DOD’s  Five  Year  Defense  Program  and  $5 
million  was  requested  by  the  Air  Force  and  approved  by  Congress  in 
FY85,  beginning  in  October  1984.  This  was  to  initiate  the  design  of  the 
new  complementary  ELV,  known  then  as  the  CELV.  As  part  of  the 
approval process, Congress requested a joint study of the requirements, 
options and costs of the CELV concept. They

approved by the President by January 15, 1985. 

The Second Battle--Competition 

An   interest ing   and   un ique   s ituat ion   occurred   as   a   resu lt   of   the

competition  for  an  expendable  launch  vehicle.  It  became  the  second

“battle of  the “war”. NASA  tried  to eliminate  the Air Force’s competition

by  getting  Congress  to  demand  that  any  unmanned  vehicle  must  be  a

large, heavy lift vehicle of 100,000 to 150,000 pounds to low earth orbit.19

Naturally  this  system  would  be  based  on  Shuttle-derived  components

and developed by NASA. The Air Force  rejected  this approach based on

the  fact  that  there  was  no  requirement  for  such  a  system.  They  stated

that “we should not substitute a near-term ELV, based on known satellite

launch  requirements, with  a  new  expensive  space  booster  development

based on undefined satellite launch requirements.”20


NASA  also  decided  that  it wanted  to  compete with  industry  for  the  new

system  that  would  meet  the  Air  Force  requirements.   They  wanted  to

submit  a  design  for  an  ELV  based  on  the  use  of  Shuttle  components--

primarily the solid rocket motors and a modified center core stage.21 The

Air Force, with great Congressional pressure, agreed to accept the NASA

proposal, but  it had  to be done so  that  the government was not  in direct

competition  with  American  industry.22   The  Air  Force  decided  that  a

w inner   of   the   industr ia l   compet it ion   wou ld   be   se lected   and   then

compared with the NASA submission. This would permit the government

to  decide  whether  it  would  buy  from  itself  or  go  to  industry.  This

approach  was  viewed  as  the  only  legal  way  to  conduct  such  a  unique

competition.23

It  was  a  bitter  competition.  First,  NASA  officials  placed  a  great  deal  of 
pressure on  the  contractors not  to bid  the Air Force  competition,  since, 
they  were  told,  their  relationship  with  NASA  would  be  jeopardized. 
Failing  that,  they  put  pressure  on  the  contractors--a  few who were  also 
bidding directly with  the Air  Force with  their  launch  vehicles  to  support 
NASA’s submission. 24 

NASA  continued  to  fight  the Air  Force’s  plan,  openly  and  underground. 
But   a   ma jor   setback   occurred   in   NASA ’s   argument .   The   Nat iona l  
Research Council study, requested by Congress and released during the 
week  of  September  7,  1984,  fully  supported  the Air  Force’s  requirement 
to have  a  complement  to  the Shuttle.25  The  report  also  noted  that  it was 
supportive of a plan to launch small payloads such as weather satellites, 
on the converted Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, known as the Titan II. 

The  Air  Force  received  four  proposals  or  the  complementary  ELV--a 
modified Titan  Ill, an  improved Atlas Centaur, and  two NASA entries--an 
SRB-X  and  a  heavy  lift  SDV-1E  The  SRB-X  design was  based  on  two  of 
the  Shuttle’s  solid  rocket  motors  strapped  to  a  core  vehicle.  The  other 
NASA  proposal  was  a  large  heavy  lift  vehicle  using  the  Shuttle’s  main 
engines  attached  to  the  external  tank  and  the  solid  rocket motors. Both 
designs would use the existing Shuttle launch pads. 

The  modified  Titan  III,  called  the  Titan  34D7,  was  the  winner  of  the 
industrial  competition.  The  rest  of  the  so-called  “competition”  was  a 
“farce”, and should have been an embarrassment to NASA and its highly 
competent engineering team. 

The  SRB-X  was  evaluated  by  the  Air  Force  Space  Division  and  its 
technical  experts  and  determined  to  be  uncontrollable  during  the  boost 
phase  of  flight.26   If  this  proposal  had  been  submitted  by  industry,  it 
wou ld   have   been   re turned   immed ia te ly   and   e l im ina ted   from   the  
competition  as  incompetent  and unresponsive  to  the  requirements.  The 
second  NASA  proposal  was  a  better  design  but  far  exceeded  the  Air 
Force’s  requirements  since  it  would  lift  payloads  which  did  not  exist, 
even conceptually. In addition, the cost of a

heavy  lift  system  would  far  exceed  any  other  alternative  due  to  the 
extensive  development  and  flight  cost. But  to  avoid  further  controversy 
and  friction  that  existed between  the Air Force  and NASA,  the Air Force 
completed the evaluation of both of NASA’s proposals. 

The  Titan  34D7  was  selected  as  the  winner  of  the  CELV  competition.  It 
me t   the   A i r   Fo rce ’s   requ i remen ts   to   p lace   10 ,000   pounds   in to  
geosynchronous orbit from the Kennedy Spaceflight Center at the lowest 
cost. It could meet the Air Force’s first flight date requirement of October 
1988.  The  Titan  would  be  truly  independent  and  would  complement  the 
Shuttle. 

To  begin  the  Titan  CELV  program  and  to meet  its  required  launch  date, 
the Air Force needed to reprogram a total of $30 million additional funds 
($5  million  was  already  approved)  in  the  FY85  Defense  Budget.  This 
request  was  submitted  to  the  four  Congressional  Committees  having 
DOD  oversight  in  the  House  and  Senate.27   The  Air  Force  started  a 
concerted  “do-or-die”  effort  to  get  the  approval  for  the  additional  $30 
million. 

Truce and The Treaty 

Numerous  “skirmishes”  occurred  throughout Washington  on  the  CELV 
issue.  NASA  supporters  were  trying  to  undermine  the  Air  Force’s 
position by getting their Congressional supporters to bloc the allocation 
of resources for the project, or to call for additional study. NASA refused 
to  coordinate  on  the  CELV  study  that  was  requested  by  Congress  and 
due  on  January  15,  1985.  They  knew  that  the  Shuttle-derived  ELV  had 
lost  the Air Force competition and  took  the position  that another year of 
study  was  required  before  a  correct  solution  could  be  found.28   This

commitment  within  the  next  year  the  ELV  production  lines  would  close 
down and the cost to reopen them would be prohibitive.

There  were  those  in  NASA  who  wanted  to  find  a  compromise  to  this 

problem  and  to  return  to  a  more  compatible  relationship  with  the 
Shuttle’s best customer. The strength and value of  this  relationship had 
jus t   been   demons tra ted   w i th   the   f irs t   Shu t t le   launch   o f   a   DOD  
operational  satellite  in  January  1985--on  STS  51-C.  While  there  was  a 
great  deal  of  press  speculation  over  the  classified  nature  of  the  launch, 
the  degree  of  cooperation  between  NASA  and  the  Air  Force  on  this 
mission  clearly  indicated  that  a  better  relationship  throughout  all  levels 
of both organizations was possible. 

The  National  Security  Council  was  also  concerned  with  the  "war" 
between   NASA   and   the   A ir   Force   and   wanted   to   f ind   a   so lut ion .  
Therefore  a  meeting  was  called  between  the  Air  Force,  NASA  and  the 
NSC Staff  to determine a way  to  resolve  the problem. Unfortunately,  the 
NASA  representative  at  the  meeting  felt  that  his  hands  were  tied  as  a 
result of the NASA Administrator’s strong position on the subject29.  The 
only way to resolve this problem would be for the NASA Administrator to 
be involved personally with the solution. 

The Solution 

On February  14,  1985  the  critical meeting occurred  in  the Old Executive 
Office  Building,  hosted  by  the  National  Security  Council.  That  meeting 
resulted in a major agreement between the Air Force, represented by the 
Under   Secretary   of   the   A ir   Force ,   and   NASA ,   represented   by   its  
Administrator. The agreement stated: 

--NASA and DOD will work together to ensure Shuttle is a viable 
operational system heading toward 24 flights per year. 

--NASA will agree with the need for a CELV, with US Air Force 
buying ten ELVs and fly them at a rate of two per year in 
1988-92. The type of ELV will be determined through a competitive 
process. 

-- DOD will commit to one-third of the available Shuttle flights over 
the next ten years, independent of the number of ELVs to be flown 
over that period. 

-A new pricing policy will be developed for Shuttle fights that will 
give positive incentive for DOD flights on the Shuttle

--And, that DOD and NASA will work together on a second 
generation Space Transportation System using manned and 
unmanned capabilities to meet all user needs. 

This  historic  and  important  agreement was  incorporated  into  a National 
Security  Decision  Directive,  known  as  the  “National  Launch  Strategy”, 
and signed by the President on February 25, 1985.30 

The "Treaty" Goes lnto Effect. 

The House Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications called  for

the  first  public  hearing  on  the  National  Launch  Strategy  on  March  7,

1985.31  The  committee  members  were  pleased  with  the  fact  that  the

fighting  between  NASA  and  the  Air  Force  had  ceased  and  a  more

positive relationship would exist.


The  Air  Force  was  elated  with  the  agreement  and,  with  the  approval  of

the  Congress,  started  the  new  program  to  complement  the  Shuttle.  The

“Shuttle-only”  policy  had  shifted  to  a  “mixed-fleet”  strategy.  The  US

space  launch  vehicle  fleet  for  launching  the  major  satellites  would

include  the  Shuttle  and  the  new  CELV,  a  Titan  34D7,  later  to  be  called’

the  Titan  IV.  The  Air  Force  also  announced  that  they  were  going  to

proceed  with  the  modification  of  a  small  number  the  Titan  II  ICBMs  to

convert  them  into  a  space  launch  vehicle  for  launching  small  satellites,

classified  and  unclassified,  from  Vandenberg  AFB.32   This  was  not  a

c r i t ica l   issue   fo r   NASA   an   the re   was   l i t t le   a rgumen t   ove r   i ts

implementation.


Then  disaster  struck.  On  August  29,  1985,  for  the  first  time  in  eighteen

years of flying Titans from Vandenberg AFB, a Titan 34D failed during the

second stage of flight. A massive oxidizer leak caused the booster to fail

before  it  reached  orbit  and  tumble  out  of  control.  The  Range  Safety

Officer  destroyed  the  booster  and  its  classified  payload  fell  into  the

Pacific Ocean. The first reaction

from the Air Force was that while the single failure was tragic, the real 
fatality would be the CELV program But that prediction was in error. The 
question on whether or not we should proceed with the CELV program 
was never raised. The only question was what went wrong and what are 
you going to do to fix it? The remaining part of 1985 was devoted to 
resolving the Titan problem and preparing for the next launch scheduled 
for April 1986. 

Epilogue 

Tragically, on January 28, 1986, over the sunny and cold skies of Florida, 
all of the worst-case predictions which supported the need for assured 
access to space and a complement to the Shuttle came true. The Shuttle 
Challenger exploded during the boost phase killing the entire flight crew. 

And then again on April 18, 1986, a second Titan 34D exploded shortly 
after launch from Vandenberg AFB--the second in a row. 

This was a devastating time for America’s space program.  There was no 
means to launch our major military and civilian spacecraft. And the time 
it would take to recover was unknown. 

But, eventually there was a positive outcome to these events The nation 
recovered from the events of 1986 with a stronger and more robust 
space launch capability than would have existed without these tragedies 
The Shuttle has become more reliable and focused on its unique 
capabilities. The Air Force’s Titan program has been expanded and 
additional launch vehicles, based on Atlas and Delta configurations have 
been procured for the government. In addition, the expanded ELV 
production has permitted a new US commercial space launch vehicle 
business to emerge. 

If failures occur in the future--and they will in spite of our best efforts--
the nation will not be left in the same position that existed in 1986, 1987 
and parts of 1988--with no assured access to Space.
