An interface is a plane or place at which independent systems or

components thereof meet and act or communicate with each other.


TYPES OF PHYSICAL INTERFACES:

Mechanical

Electrical 


An interface media such as physical contact, electrical signals in wiring,  

fluid flow in plumbing, or a radio signal in space.


As a function of being bolted together, two physically interfacing 

components will remain attached.


As a function of being connected by a wire harness, an aircraft on-board  

computer may send a command to the aileron actuator of an aircraft that  

causes the aileron to move interacting with the air mass of the  

environment, in a relative motion with respect to the aircraft, to roll and 

turn the aircraft such that the command signal is nulled out in the on-

board computer as a function of the guidance system detecting approach 

to the direction commanded.


It is common practice to associate an interface with one of two 
types: functional and physical. 
A physical interface involves the form and fit of mating parts. 
Examples of physical interfaces include: mounting bolt patterns, 
drive shaft flange connections, mating wire harness connector 
physical attachment, and the tires of a fighter plane resting on the 
apron. 
Some examples of functional interfaces are a 28VDC signal 
passing from a solenoid driver in an on-board computer to a valve 
solenoid in a pressurization control unit, a digital data stream 
flowing from an instrumentation control unit to a flight data 
recorder input port, and the flow of liquid oxygen from a rocket 
propellant system to the engine. 

INTERFACE CONTROL DOCUMENT (ICD)


This is a document that is used to document the interface definition and is also 
used to control the interface so that it cannot be changed without both sides of 
the interface knowing that it has been changed. 

Interfaces  Definition 


An interface Is defined as the functional and physical characteristics required to 
exist at a common boundary between two or more equipment items/computer 
programs.â€”Apperdbcll ML-STD-483 

Must also include human interfaces
