 time information.
     E . Location-where to locate geographically--multi-mission (CSM and
LM)- Agena target vehicle--rendezvous and docking. 
Greatly Expanded Mission Rules And Malfunction Procedure
Requirements 

Apollo Flight Control Requirements
 A. MCC design requirements-Besides Gemini and its requirements to
operate one manned and one unmanned vehicle together-Apollo required
support to two manned vehicles. Also the need to support two separate
missions simultaneously --Gemini and unmanned Apollo tests--Two control
rooms and associated communication and computer
requirements.(Fortuitous flight control support to Gemini-76)
 B. Computer analysis and support to entirely new set of orbital
mechanics problems--Launch aborts, EO and  TLI and possible earth return-
-free return trajectories and quick return to earth--LOI and its associated
abort trajectories.
 C. Lunar orbit determination--accuracy problems--Lunar gravitational
anomalies found from  Lunar Orbiter
 D. Optimal lunar descent trajectories and abort from them--Landing
point selection , accuracy  and prediction--
1. Maximum performance vs. pilot view of landing site and choice of
landing point.
 E. Lunar launch trajectory and rendezvous requirements--rendezvous
with CSM--LEM disposal and impact prediction--
F. EOI and attendant abort problems--
G. Translunar corrections to meet earth entry requirements, entry
corridors and skip trajectory control
1. Landing point control and prediction including possibilities of
weather avoidance.
 H. Deep Space Network interfaces. Real time world wide
communications--Tracking, telemetry, voice transmissions--phasing and use
of numerous capabilities throughout US and the world--Spain and Australia.
 I. Requirements of stated needs brought total revampment of MCC
computer and communications complex.

Flight Control Support To Unmanned Apollo Development Tests
A. Launch abort tests, TPS and CSM launch and  reentry tests--use of 
Saturn V--Saturn V anomalies and program effects.
All of above allowed for qualification of flight control concepts and
flight controller training and qualification 

Apollo 1 Disaster
 A. Cause and effect

 . 
Formulation Of Apollo Test Program
 A. Unmanned development tests, manned tests to prove CSM and LEM
hardware in EO, lunar operations pre landing attempt, lunar landing
 B. Formulation of step by step test program, each phase building on the
results of previous missions
1.Each category a set of objectives--number of flights required in each
category thought possibly more then one depending on results. 

Conception Of Manned Lunar Orbit Mission-Apollo 8
 A. LEM Problems--CSM ready as planned
B. Expedite flight objectives to reach moon
C. Lunar fly by vs. lunar orbit

readiness.

Apollo 13
 A. Flight control's finest hour.
Shuttle Challenges To Flight Control
 A. Use of aerodynamic capabilities--on board computer redundancy--
systems redundancy

 B. Abort possibilities--use of aerodynamics and on board propulsion
a. Separation and recontact problems with ET

Decision To Fly Manned Or Unmanned On First Flight
 A. Risk analysis--design philosophy and systems reliability
B. Low g flight made pilot less liable to health problems
C. Training and simulation capability--fixed base, movable base, G-2
simulator--all added confidence for pilot capability.
D. High risk factors--Launch abort-RTLS-entry aerodynamics and
autopilot reliability-TPS-landing proficiency
E. Pilot presence made system reliability significantly higher in all
cases
 F. Discussed at highest levels of the agency--recommended by all
management levels.
G. Thoughts in retrospect--what unmanned capability would provide
Approach and Landing Tests
A. Orbiter transport--747 purchase and reconfiguration
B. 747 offered landing test opportunity
C. Need for proof of dead stick landing--pilot confidence and training
D. Aid to development of  landing techniques--flare and gear deploy

F. Test results--additional knowledge and experience always helpful
a. Control rates--airplane response to elevon control
Determining When To Fly First Shuttle
 A. Admittedly difficult decision particularly because of manned first
flight--first time a rocket system flown manned on first flight
B. Critical design reviews--programmatic
C. Design factors--structure at least FS-1.4 and quad redundancy in
all orbiter critical systems--extensive engine tests to prove engine
qualification--solid rocket tests and reliability (design flaw determined after
flight tests)
D. TPS concerns--structural integrity--SIP--Bond to aluminum skin,
method of attachment, proof testing, TPS test articles--combined loads, lost
tile concerns, critical tile criteria (surface density discovery), transition
point, steps and gaps-established criteria, interference problems at doors and

aero controls and aero leak problems, instrumentation for post flight analysis
E. Entry control--aerodynamic properties, instability (gain changing),
Monte Carlo analysis, landing point control, energy preservation and
concepts (Use of G-2 provided pilot and program confidence)
F. Outside Expert Reviews--pros and cons
G. Final dissenters--thought TPS tiles would fail in the SIP or at the
bond line due to vibration and or aerodynamic loads--NASA  engineers
disagreed on basis of tests and analysis
H. How decide when ready to fly? Simply--did not know what else to
do so it was time to suck it up and GO.
I. Unknowns and “unknown” unknowns

Opinion--Today’s Travesty--Not Using STS and ISS.
