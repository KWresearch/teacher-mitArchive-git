Launch Processing System (LPS) / Control Room


Launch Processing System (LPS) / Control Room


 Description 
 Automated and computer controlled Shuttle launch and checkout 
system 
 Customized hardware for Shuttle 
 Custom language used for application software 
 Linked to orbiter, External Tank, and Solid Rocket Booster, and 
Ground Support Equipment at all processing locations 
 Operations Support 
 Automated checkout of Shuttle and associated Ground Support 
Equipment during preparation for launch 
 Problem resolution and data reduction 

Engineering Approach


 Engineering Requirements – Demonstrate the “as built ready to launch 
shuttle” is the same “as designed and certified” 
 Development / design organizations establish requirements implemented at KSC 
 Requirements dictate hardware / software performance and limitations in 
ground tests and inspections 
 Verified by review of documents used to assemble, inspect and test 
 Periodic management reviews certify readiness 
 Launch Count Requirements 
 Requirements documented in engineering drawings, NASA Program documents 
and Launch Commit Criteria 
 Acceptable limits for the system performance and the configuration of the 
hardware and software 
 System Engineers develop procedures and software to implement 

requirements

 Approximately 500 requirements with approximately 2000 associated

measurements 

 Launch count procedures: Approximately 20 documents totaling 5000 pages 
 Approximately 500 software programs

Launch Count - Controls


 The Ground Launch Sequencer (GLS) is the software supervisor of 

critical command sequencing and measurement verification for 

terminal launch countdown  

  Issues or delegates all ground initiated commands to the Shuttle and Ground 
Support Equipment (GSE) from T-9 min 
  Initiates critical activities performed by software at other firing room system 
consoles 
 Monitors all measurements whose violation require immediate reaction 
 Monitors all measurements associated with GLS issued commands 
 Performs critical safing 
 Controls ground and onboard clocks – sets liftoff time 

Human Factors


 Automation vs. Manual Control 
 Responsibility 
 Teamwork Dynamics 
 Decision making process 
 Communication 
  “Launch Fever”
