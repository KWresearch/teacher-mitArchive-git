BOB SIECK 
Mr. Sieck's aerospace career began in 1960 when he was a Lieutenant in the Air Force
assigned to missile operations in Arizona and Florida.  He joined NASA at KSC in 1964
as a manned spacecraft test and launch operations engineer, responsible for prelaunch
checkout and servicing of Gemini and Apollo spacecraft systems. He held this position
for all the manned Gemini and Apollo missions. After Apollo he was transferred to the
Space Shuttle development program and was appointed ground operations Engineering
Manager for the Shuttle Approach and Landing Tests at Dryden Flight Research Center.
Returning to KSC in 1978, he became Chief Shuttle Project Engineer responsible for
KSC Shuttle processing integrated tests and procedures. Subsequently he was appointed
Director of Launch and Landing Operations and served as Launch Director for 11
missions. In 1985 he became Shuttle Operations Director. In 1986 he was again
appointed Launch Director for return to flight and held this position for STS 26R and all
subsequent missions thru STS 63. He was Launch Director for 52 space shuttle missions.
Mr. Sieck completed his career at NASA as Director of Shuttle Processing where he
managed the transition of the KSC ground operations to the Spaceflight Operations
Contractor. In 1999 he retired from NASA and was appointed to the Aerospace Safety
Advisory Panel where he served until 2003. He is currently a member of the Stafford-
Covey Shuttle Return to Flight Task Group. 
Mr. Sieck received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Virginia in
1960 and did post graduate work at Texas A & M and the Florida Institute of
Technology. 
From an engineer's perspective my real contribution was developing the integrated
ground operation's procedures and software for the first shuttle launch count, which are
essentially still in place today. My toughest job was managing the transition of KSC
ground operations responsibility from NASA to USA, and of course the best job was
when I was launch director.
