SHUTTLE HISTORY


•	 1952 FULLY REUSABLE LAUNCH 
VEHICLE CONCEPT DISCUSSED 
•	 1962 FULLY REUSABLE VEHICLE 
SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED 
•	 AIR FORCE STUDIED PROJECT 
DYNASOAR, WHICH WAS CANCELLED 
IN 1969 
•	 1969 NASA ADOPTED THE IDEA OF A 
FULLY REUSABLE SPACE SHIP 

1 

TOP LEVEL REQUIREMENTS


•	 FULLY REUSABLE 
•	 14 DAY TURN AROUND TO NEXT FLIGHT

•	 DEPLOY AND RETRIEVE PAYLOADS 
•	 DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, & TEST PHASE 
ESTIMATED TO BE 5.1B IN 1971 DOLLARS 
•	 ORIGINAL COST PER FLIGHT FOR 65,000 
POUNDS WAS 10.5M PER FLIGHT IN 1971 $ 
FOR A FLIGHT RATE OF 60 PER YEAR

SHUTTLE STUDIES


•	 PHASE “A” STUDIES WERE 
CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE BASIC 
REQUIREMENTS AND THEIR EFFECT 
ON DESIGN IN 1969 
•	 PRINCIPAL ISSUES: 
– SIZE AND WEIGHT OF PAYLOAD 
– CROSS RANGE OF THE ORBITER 
– HEAT-RESISTANT STRUCTURE OR 
REUSABLE INSULATING MATERIAL

SHUTTLE STUDIES


•  PRINCIPAL ISSUES:

– HYPERGOLIC REACTION CONTROL 
SYSTEM OR LIQUID OXYGEN/HYDROGEN 
– FLY- BY-WIRE FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM

– WIND TUNNEL TESTS TO DETERMINE 
WING SIZE AND CONFIGURATION 
– AIR BREATHING ENGINES WERE 
CONSIDERED FOR FLY BACK; LATER 
WERE DETERMINED TO BE TOO HEAVY

SHUTTLE STUDIES


•  PRINCIPAL ISSUES: 
– ENTRY TECHNIQUES 
– LANDING SPEED 
– APPROACH PATTERN

SHUTTLE STUDIES


•	 PHASE “B” STUDIES WERE PERFORMED IN 
MID 1970’S TO DETERMINE A PRELIMINARY 
DESIGN 
•	 RESULTS: 
–	 FULLY RECOVERABLE ORBITER 
–	 DISPOSABLE FUEL TANK 
–  PARACHUTE-RECOVERABLE SOLID ROCKET 
BOOSTERS 
–  HIGH PERFORMANCE HYDROGEN-OXYGEN 
ENGINES PLACED IN THE ORBITER TO BE 
RECOVERED

RESULTS OF STUDIES


•	 FULLY REUSABLE WITH FLY-BACK 
BOOSTER WAS GREATER THAN 5.1B. 
•	 MANY CONFIGURATIONS WERE STUDIED 
(EXAMPLES) 
•	 TURN AROUND TIME REQUIRED LANDING A 
WINGED VEHICLE ON A RUNWAY 
•	 PAYLOAD DEPLOYMENT AND RETRIEVAL 
REQUIREMENT DETERMINED LOCATION OF 
ORBITER ON LAUNCH CONFIGURATION

MAJOR SHUTTLE

CONFIGURATION DECISIONS

•	 HYDROGEN/OXYGEN MAIN ENGINES

•	 THIS SIZED THE LIQUID 
OXYGEN/HYDROGEN TANK, WHICH IS NOT 
REUSABLE 
•	 SOLID ROCKET BOOSTERS PROVIDED THE 
ADDITIONAL PROPULSION REQUIRED TO 
GET THE ORBITER INTO EARTH ORBIT 
•	 SOLID ROCKET BOOSTERS DESIGNED TO 
BE RECOVERED AND RE-USED 

8 

ORBITER DECISIONS


•	 ORBITER ENTRY CROSS RANGE REQUIRED 
DELTA WINGS 
•  DELETION OF AIR BREATHING ENGINES 

FOR MOVING ORBITER REQUIRED THE

BOEING 747 TO CARRY THE ORBITER 

•	 FO/FS GUIDANCE, NAVIGATION, AND 
CONTROL SYSTEM 
•	 FLY- BY- WIRE WITH A DIGITAL AUTO PILOT


9 

ORBITER DECISIONS


•	 SIZE OF PAYLOAD BAY 60 FEET LONG 
BY 15 FEET DIAMETER 
•	 SIZE OF CREW CABIN DEFINED TO BE 
OVER 2600 CUBIC FEET 
•	 PAYLOAD 65,000 POUNDS AT LIFT OFF 
AND 35,OOO POUNDS AT LANDING 
•  THE ORBITER IS A LAUNCH VEHICLE,

A SPACE CRAFT, AND AN AIRCRAFT

HARDWARE SUB-SYSTEMS


•	 THERMAL PROTECTION SYSTEM

•	 STRUCTURES 
•	 SPACE SHUTTLE MAIN ENGINES

•	 HYDRAULIC, AUX POWER, FUEL CELLS. OMS, & 
RCS SYSTEMS 
•	 GUIDANCE, NAVIGATION, AND CONTROL

•	 ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL & LIFE SUPPORT IN 
CREW CABIN 
•	 LANDING & MECHANICAL SYSTEMS

•	 COMMUNICATIONS 
•	 ELECTRICAL POWER

ORBITER SUB-SYSTEMS


•  MAJOR ISSUES

–  FUNCTIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE 
PERFORMED (FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS) 
–  PERFORMANCE THAT IS REQUIRED 

(PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS)

–  WEIGHT 
–  INTERFACES 
–  AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY

–  SCHEDULE 
–  COST
