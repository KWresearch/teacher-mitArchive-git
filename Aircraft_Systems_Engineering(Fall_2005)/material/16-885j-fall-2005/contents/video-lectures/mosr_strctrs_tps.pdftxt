The Systems Engineering (SE) Process


•	 A thorough and in-depth Systems Engineering effort is 
critical to the success of any complex development 
program, especially where technology advancement is 
required. 

•	 The Space Shuttle Program is an  excellent case study


•	

In the SE process, structural engineering is an important 
element, and is the SE element for which this lecture 
focuses.

The Systems Engineering Process (con’t)


•	 Structural engineering parameters assessed during each 
phase of the Shuttle design and operations process 
–	 Concept Studies – weight, cost, producibility 
–	 Concept Definition – weight, cost, producibility 
–	 Preliminary Design – detail design trades- configuration, weight, cost, 
producibility and operations 
–	 Critical Design – same as PD but emphasis on weight, cost, and flight 
certification plans. 
–	 Production – weight management, anomaly resolution consistent with 
design requirements 
–	 Certification – design and/or operations modifications 
–	 Operations – determining operations flexibility within the capabilities of 
the structure

Beginning Design, Development, Test and 

Evaluation (DDT&E)


•	 Four years of NASA in-house and contracted studies 
resulted in the configuration and top level requirements 
that were structure drivers, e.g. 
–	 Orbiter Life - 100 missions 
–	 Payload – 65K lbs., 15’dia.x 60’lg, 1 to 10 
–	 1265 mile cross range  (entry to landing) 
–	 Max. aero dynamic pressure, q=650 psf 
–	 Max. ascent acceleration, 3 g’s 
–	 Re-entry maneuvers, 2.5 g/-1.0g limit 
–	 Rationale loss of one SSME during ascent 
•	 The challenge was to not over specify the structural 
requirements in order to enable flexibility and authority 
for the contracted DDT&E

Challenges for the Definition Phase


•  Detailed Design criteria 
•  Airframe material 
•  Structural design 
– Integral or floating cabin 
– Accounting for Thermal Stress

– Compartment venting 
– Major Structural Concepts Trades 
•  Design Loads 

MIT Lecture

Orbiter Structural Design Criteria 


•	 Ultimate Factor of Safety = 1.4 for limit load (maximum 
expected loads) 
•	 Yield F.S. – not specified (no detrimental deformation 
allowed for limit loads) 
•	 Thermal and mechanical stresses to be additive except 
when thermal stress is relieving 
•	 Life -100 missions with a scatter factor or 4, all parts 
considered for fracture mechanics 
•	 Ultimate F.S.=1.25 at the end of life 
•	 Material allowables 
–	 95 percentile and 95 percent confidence for single load paths 
–	 90 percentile and 95 percent confidence for redundant load 
paths 

MIT Lecture 

16 

Combined Stress Criteria


•	 An unprecedented criterion was 
established for combining stresses to 
– Assure determining a realistic maximum 

expected stress 

– Avoid reducing stress because of thermal 
gradients 
– Incorporate classical tank pressure induced 
stress

Airframe Material


•	 Systems studies showed that the weight of 
structure plus TPS was approximately the same 
(p.20)

–  Based on allowable max. temp., heat sink, and unit 
weights 
•	 Aluminum was selected based 
–	 Producibility and material properties data base 
–	 SR-71 (Titanium – “Black Bird”) experience

–	 Beryllium  manufacturing difficulty.

 Crew Module (Cabin) Design 


•	 Pressure integrity of the Cabin was critical 
for crew safety and had to be verified prior 
to each flight. 
•	 A “floating” design (p.22) isolated the 
Cabin from the fuselage loads, simplified 
the design and increased reliability. 
•	 The Cabin design weight was 30K lbs. 
based on Apollo densities and growth.

Crew Module Concept 


•Pressure vessel design

•Four discrete attachment 
points with the forward 
fuselage 

•Minimum heat transfer to 
Crew Module 

•Fracture mechanics – leak 
before rupture

Accounting for Thermal Stress


Issue:

•	 Desensitizing the structural design for thermal stress 
was not practical (based on SR-71 and Concorde 
experience). 
•	 Areas effected by thermal gradients 
–	 between skin-stringer panels and frames or ribs 
–	 between upper and lower wing covers 
–	 circumferentially around frames 
–	 between lower surface and side skin panels 
–	 between the wing and fuselage and tail and fuselage 
–	 Within skin-stringer panels 
•	 Not possible to represent the entire structure with a 3-D 
finite element model for temperature and loads 

MIT Lecture 

23 

Accounting for Thermal Stress (con’t)


Approach: 

•	 Determined the temperatures on the vehicle for 
eight initial conditions for entry and at several 
times during entry 
•	 Analyzed 100+ models for various regions of the 
vehicle and extrapolated to the entire structural 
model (p.25) 
•  The operational planners had to ensure that the

operational envelope stayed within the budget.

Compartment Venting


•	 Previous spacecraft design would have 
connected the entire volume and vented it 
through base vent areas. 
•	 The Orbiter design precluded this approach 
because of contamination and cleanliness of the 
payload bay and the potential hazards of 
hydrogen concentration. 
•	 Extensive analyses were required because of 
the pressure coefficients at the vents, pressure 
differential across bulkheads, and to define 
critical combinations of venting parameters. 

MIT Lecture 

26 

Major Structural Concept Trades


•	 SSME Thrust Structure: Space frame vs. plate girder 
saved 1730 lbs. of weight 
•	 Aft Wing Spar carry-through: Integrating with the aft 
(1307) bulkhead vs. a floating carry through saved 450 
lbs. of weight 
•	 Payload bay doors: Designed for torsion and 
pressure loads only (not body bending) to enable doors 
to be flexible and “zipped” closed prior to re-entry, or 
maximum reliability for opening and closing in space. 
•	 Payload attachments: Designed to be statically 
determinate so as to preclude load sharing based on the 
relative stiffness of Orbiter and payload(s).

Lift-Off Loads


•  Determined by a statistical combination of:

–  Rocket engines 
•  Start Sequence 
•  Thrust vector misalignment 
•  Ignition overpressure 
–  Ground winds and gusts 
–  Vortex shedding 
–  Proximity to nearby structures 
–  Pressurization 
–  Shrinkage of structure because of cryo temps.

Ascent Loads


•	

•	 Surveying the entire flight envelope to determine critical 
conditions for hardware design was cumbersome and 
not practical 
Innovative approach: 

–	 Developed synthetic wind profiles using recorded data and 
guidelines 
–	 Determined angle of attack and sideslip by analytically flying the 
vehicle (with control system) through the synthetic winds profiles 
–	 Added system dispersions (3 sigma) such as SRB thrust 
mismatch, aerodynamics, thrust variations, flight control system 
variations 
–	 Generated an envelope of side slip and angle of attack was 
generated (similar to an aircraft V-n diagram) 
–	 Generated design loads at any point around the “squatcheloid” 
envelope (p. 35).

Ascent Loads Envelope (Squatchaloids)


MIT Lecture

35 

Benefits of the Squatcheloid Approach


•	 Load indicators were established for hundreds of 
conditions within the envelope that could be 
used for trajectory analyses 

•	 SSME thrust structure were designed for 
realistic conditions rather than a worst case 

•  Allowed the performance, flight control, and 

structures disciplines to work in parallel.


MIT Lecture 

36 

Descent Loads


•	 Entry simulations using ballistic trajectories did not 
require any significant maneuvers and therefore no 
meaningful “design to” envelopes. 
•	 Structural design was based on Mach number 
dependent V-n diagrams (p.38) 
•	 Max. speed, equivalent to 375 psf, was derived from 
upsetting the nominal trajectory and recovering within 
the entry control limits. 
•	 The criterion came under serious challenge because the 
deterministic flight conditions could not justify the many 
descent cases. 
•  The criterion was found to be logical and set a precedent

for deviating from deterministic ballistic load definition.

Challenges for Detailed Design


•  Weight reduction 
•  Ground Certification for first flight 


MIT Lecture

Weight Reduction 


•	 As with any aircraft or spacecraft, weight 
control/management is a major effort and 
requires a weight reduction effort – no different 
for the Orbiter. 
•	 Weight reductions:

–  Payload bay doors – 900 lbs. - Changing from 
Aluminum to Graphite/Epoxy (limited knowledge) 
–  Thrust Structure – 1200 lbs.(?) – Titanium stiffened 
with Boron/Epoxy for increased compression modulus 
–	 Other use of composite materials (p.41)

(Deviating from the “norm”

and Innovation)


MIT Lecture 

43 

Ultimate Strength Integrity 


•	 Consistent with classical airframe certification, the Orbiter Project 
planned for a dedicated Static Test Article. 
•	 Situation: 
–	 Most of the primary structure had significant thermal stress components. 
Attempts to factor mechanical loads to induce equivalent thermal stress 
resulted in inconsistent stress distribution. 
–	 Combining mechanical loads and thermal environment (ala Concorde 
testing) was not practical 
–	 The Project had a $100 million funding short-fall 
•	 Solution: 
–	 Apply 110% of limit mechanical loads to an airframe 
–	 Predict the strain response to verify the structural analyses 
–	 Extrapolate to 140% of mechanical load and add thermal stress to 
demonstrate ultimate load capability 
–	 Refurbish the airframe as a flight vehicle (Challenger) to save $100 M. 
–	 The approach passed an independent review of “wide body aircraft” 
experts.

Fatigue Life Integrity


•	 Consistent with classical airframe certification, the Orbiter Project 
planned for a dedicated Fatigue Test Article. 
•	 Situation 
–	 A short life of 100 missions did not indicate low- cycle, high-stress being 
critical for integrity 
–	 High acoustic levels (p. 47) did indicate that high-cycle, low-stress was 
critical for integrity 
–	 How to certify a large, complex, multi-material, multi-configuration 
structure with multi-combinations of mechanical and thermal loads at 
high acoustic levels. 
•	 Solution 
–	 Test representative structure (p.47) acoustically to failure to determine 
the acoustic fatigue damage allowable 
–	 Size the test articles so only one third of the specimen was the test 
region – two thirds was compromised for boundary conditions. 
–	 Adjust the determined allowable for the effect of flight loads and 
elevated temperature.

•	 The US had re-entry vehicle experience with 

–  ablative TPS (Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo) – not 
reusable 
–  “hot structure” designs (up to 800 deg. F) – complex 
design 
–	 metallic TPS (up to 2800 deg. F) – oxidation

•	 NASA and contractor Lockheed developed a 
fibrous silica material with 2500 deg. F capability 
–	 fragile and low strength

Issues:

•	 A large number of densified and undensified

(loss of one catastrophic), and some fail-safe. 
•	 Needed to quickly demonstrate the required 

strength integrity. 
Solution: 
•	 Proof load test each tile to 125% of flight load, or

•	 Demonstrate by other methods that adequate 
strength existed

Flight Experience/Ops Modifications


•	 Rigorous and innovative engineering and testing enabled the Orbiter 
Structure and TPS to perform successfully for design-to flight environments 
(not including debris). 
•	 Surprises on STS-1 
–	 Overpressure on the vehicle because hydrogen gas accumulation 
–	 Center of pressure on the wing was further outboard and aft than predicted 
(because of SRB plume effect on pressure distribution) 
–	 Tile damage from debris 
•	 Operations Changes 
–	 Hydrogen accumulation was contained and burned prior to SSME ignition 
–	 Ascent profiles were tailored to stay within the wing structural allowables 
modifying ascent trajectories and SSME thrust. Later day-of-launch winds were 
used to predict wing loads and increase the probability of launch. 
•	 Design Changes 
–	 The ET foam insulation process was modified

Challenges for the MIT Systems

Engineering Study

•	 What different evaluation parameters, criteria, and analytical tools 
would you use during each phase of development and operations? 
•	 What are the analytical tools are available today that were not 
available then, and what is the significance? Especially consider a 
combine thermal and structural model.  Thermal stress is important. 
•	 Are there thermal protection systems that could withstand the same 
environment as the Shuttle but that would be more damage 
tolerant? 
•	 Would you design a separate crew escape system?  Would this be 
the most reliable system for crew safety, or would it better to make 
the entire system more reliable? 
•	 How would you “fix” the ET Insulation debris/Orbiter TPS problem? 
•	 How important is “political systems engineering” and should it be a 
consideration for an entire program or even for a crew escape 
system?
