There should be a lot of information available about me on the

internet. In 1996 the Johnson Space Center did an Oral History

Project where they spent about 4 hrs interviewing me, along with

most of the other people that worked on Apollo and the Space

Shuttle. I know that is available on the net along with a lot of other 


stuff.  Some of that may differ from my thinking now as time has a 
way of changing what one remembers and what a person thinks is 
significant. I would suggest that any interested student visit those 
sights. Thibodaux and Faget would be particularly good ones to 
look at and read. 
While with ABMA, I designed and tested the roll control system 
used on the first Jupiter’s. That consisted of 4 small 25 lb peroxide 
thrusters on the base of Jupiter. It was later replaced with a nozzle 
using the exhaust from the main engine turbine.

 I designed and did all the testing on the vernier correction system 
for the warhead on the Jupiter. That consisted of a single gimbaled 
500 lb peroxide thruster. The first one failed to work as I did not 
realize that when the Jupiter main engine shut down all the fuel 
would go to the top of the tank and the nitrogen just bubbled 
through the fuel and produced no thrust. To make matters worse no 
one could tell me where the gravity vector would be or if there 
would even be one when the start command was given. We had 3 
days to come up with a fix and get it retrofitted in the next system. 
One of the technicians suggested we put a flex hose in the tank 
with a weight on the end. That is exactly what we did. We took a 
braided bellows flex hose, cut the braid off it and welded it to the 
end of the inlet fitting to the tank, put a weight on the end of it and 
stuffed it into the tank. That was perhaps this country’s first zero 
gravity expulsion system and it worked. The bellows inside the 
braid was very thin and very flexible. Since there was no delta 
pressure across the bellows there was no need for the braid on the 
outside of the bellows. 

I designed a 500lb thrust LOX/RP1 engine for use in wind tunnel 
and high altitude studies. Eight of these thrusters were clustered in 
a 13 inch diameter rocket for a 1/20 scale model of the Saturn 1B. 
This model was used for wind tunnel testing on Base heating, 
design of the launch deflectors and high altitude testing in a 
vacuum chamber. A variation of this model was used to solve the 

base heating problem on Polaris, to understand the base heating on 
Saturn 5 and the Space Shuttle. That was the best program I 
worked on. I did the design, the hardware was fabricated in our 
machine shop and I did all the testing. That project set the stage for 
everything that came later. I learned about materials, heat transfer, 
fluid dynamics, Combustion dynamics, Instrumentation, control 
systems, tolerance buildup, Machine shop tools and capabilities. 
The program was so successful that I was asked to make a 20 
minute movie which I did mostly from test film. Dr. Von Braun 
showed the movie to congress in about 1959. Those were the days 
when we had good supervisors. They gave us a lot of flexibility 
and a lot more responsibility then we deserved. I probably 
designed 20 different injector designs, and 5 or 6 camber designs. I 
remember needing to put a copper chamber inside a stainless steel 
chamber and we didn’t have sufficient room to put a mechanical 
connection between the two so I wanted to weld the two together. 
I was told we could not weld copper to Stainless so I hung around 
that afternoon until everyone else left work. I got a piece of copper 
and a piece of stainless, clamped them in a vice and using a TIG 
welder and a tungsten rod I practiced until I could glue the two 
together. The next day I showed the technicians that you could 
weld the two together. I quickly learned that when you try and 
come up with a 1/20 scale of the H-1 engine that some things don’t 
scale. For example the nozzle on the H-1 engine was less then _ 
inch thick. To scale that to 1/20 would have made it 0.025 inches 
thick. Trying to put a cooling system in that would be impossible. I 
could run a test, look at the data and make a few changes, take the 
sketch by the machine shop when I left work. The next morning I 
would stop by the machine shop, pick up the part and test it that 
day, look at the data and sketch up a new part and drop it back by 
the machine shop that evening. At first I would sketch up the 
changes I wanted and give the sketch to the drafting group but that 
proved much too slow to get anything done. I made many mistakes 
and with each mistake I learned a lot. We did a lot of cut and try 
with very little analysis. 

When I transferred to the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston I 
knew as much or more about what could be, what may be and what 
was not likely then most everyone else there when it came to small 
propulsion systems. I remember sitting in a meeting one day where 
the contractor was going over the plans for one of the altitude 
facilities for testing small rocket engines. When they finished with 
the briefing I told them that it was a very fine design, there was but 
one small problem it would not work and told them why. The 
reason I knew that is that we had taken some big tanks welded 
them together and put a vacuum pump on them. We could pump 
the system down to about 200,000 foot altitude and fire my little 
rocket engine. The exhaust had to make a 90 degree turn about 5 ft 
from the engine. Instead of turning the gas just bounced back and 
killed the vacuum around the engine. I then spent several weeks 
with the contractor re designing the facilities. 

These are just some typical examples of my early years with the 
Government. We had good facilities, very good technicians and 
outstanding management, not only at ABMA, but at Langley, the 
Lewis Research Center and the Navy Research centers.  I am 
absolutely convinced that, had it not been for this experienced 
group of individuals that had accomplished so much in their own 
right, we would never have made it to the moon. I am equally 
convinced that had we not started the Space Shuttle when we did it 
would not have been successful. When we started the Space 
Shuttle program we had a very large cadre of people in industry 
that were experienced in all the disciplines required to build 
manned space vehicles. This country for many years had this 
industrial capability in the Aircraft industry. In 1972 we also had 
this capability in Space. Just to use the Space Shuttle main engines 
as an example: Within the span of a persons working life span the 
same people that designed the Redstone engine, designed the 
Jupiter, Thor, Atlas, Saturn 1, Saturn 5 first, second and 3 rd stage 
engines and the Shuttle Main Engines. The development of the 

Space Shuttle engines was started in 1972. We have done nothing 
in this country since. Now we are thinking about going back to the 
moon. We no longer have that cadre of experienced people to lean 
on because we did away with the government labs and haven’t had 
a consistent program within industry to maintain the experience 
base necessary in industry. I think this country is going to discover 
just how difficult it really was to go to the moon. Going into space 
is still not easy. It takes just too much energy and the equipment 
has to be too light. Since the Apollo program we have made much 
progress in most of the areas required for space travel but have 
accomplished little in the way of propulsion. It is just not natural 
for earth bound engineers to think in terms of the absence of 
pressure and the absence of gravity. 

I hope this will be of some benefit
