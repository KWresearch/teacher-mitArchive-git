EMPLOYEMENT: 

1959-1961 -- NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia.  Systems Engineering 
Section, Engineering Division.  Involved in the design of pneumatic and hydraulic 
control systems for the onsite research facilities. 

1961-1962 -- Space Task Group, (forerunner of Manned Spacecraft Center), Hampton, 
Virginia.  Mechanical Systems Section, Flight Systems Division.  Analytically 
demonstrated, for the first time, the space radiator approach to heat rejection for the 
Apollo vehicle, and participated in the overall design of the environmental control 
system. 

1962-1990-- NASA Johnson Space Center (formerly Manned Spacecraft Center), Houston, 
Texas.  Engineering Directorate.  Responsible for the design, development and test of 

environmental and thermal control systems, as well as astronaut EVA equipment for 
existing and advanced spacecraft. 

1990-Present -- NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas.  Engineering Directorate, 
Chief, Automation,  Robotics and Simulation Division.  Mr. Guy supports all major 
NASA programs, including Space Shuttle, Space Station, and future programs such as 
the Space Exploration Initiative with robotics devices (including in-space manipulators) 
and advanced automation systems.  In addition to these in-line responsibilities, his 
Division provides the focus for technology development, evaluation and application in 
teleoperated robotics, autonomous robotics, and advanced automation systems.  He also 
provides management of several full-scale, robotic, crew training facilities, as well as a 
Virtual Reality crew training capability for extra-vehicular crew activity and the use of 
space robotic devices.  In addition, he manages the Systems Engineering Simulator -- the 
Center’s largest, real-time, integrated simulation for crew-in-the-loop engineering and 
operations analyses for Shuttle and Station. 

SHUTTLE EXPERIENCE: 

Chief, Systems Engineering Branch 
Lead, Environmental/Thermal Control & Life Support for NASA’s “skunk-works” 
activity to develop the conceptual design of the Orbiter prior to formal Shuttle 
Program initiation. 

Lead,  Environmental/Thermal Control & Life Support for the Technical Committee 
of the NASA Source Selection Board’s proposal evaluation team to select the Orbiter 
prime contractor. 

Lead for the development of analytical trade-off tools for system/subsystem design 
definition; as well as, the formulation of the thermo-kinematics and fluid flow 
simulators for system/subsystem performance analyses. 

Assistant Division Chief for Test and Development 
Established an Atmospheric Revitalization Subsystem (ARS) test facility and 
conducted subsystem evaluations to demonstrate the viability of the contractor-
proposed ARS design to maintain a habitable environment for the Shuttle crew.  Also 
performed LiOH performance testing, which resulted in an entirely new batch 
screening protocol to ensure consistent carbon dioxide absorption performance under 
spacecraft operating conditions. 

Established a Rotating Equipment Life-test Lab to ensure that the 20,000 hour/100 
mission life expectancy could be met for all Orbiter cabin pumps, fans,, and centrifugal 
water separators.

 Established an Orbiter Environmental Control System (ECS) Test Facility with high-
fidelity cabin geometry and pressurized volume, which was outfitted with cert-class 
environmental/thermal control and life support hardware/subsystems for system-level 
testing under both normal and emergency operating conditions. 

Conducted numerous Atmospheric Pressure and Composition Control Subsystem test 
series in the ECS Test Facility, for both positive and negative cabin pressure relief 
hardware performance, and oxygen/nitrogen partial pressure control effectiveness at 
various total pressure levels – 8, 9, 10.2, & 14.7 psia. 

Deputy Division Chief 
Established a cert-class Airlock Test Facility as an adjunct to the ECS Test Facility for 
the “man-rating” of the Orbiter EVA airlock to support the space-suited crew during 
the transition from the cabin to the external environs of space. 

Conducted a system-level test of the complete Active Thermal Control Subsystem 
(ATCS) in the large thermal/vacuum chamber at JSC to ensure acceptable integrated-
system performance of the various hear sinks and heat sources that compose the ATCS 
(i.e., sinks: four two-sided space radiators, four single-sided radiators, flash 
evaporators and ammonia boiler; sources: cabin, fuel cell, hydraulics, electronics, and 
payload). 

Division Chief 
Managed the real-time Environmental/Thermal Control and Life Support engineering 
team, providing technical expertise in support of the Mission Control Center for 
Shuttle’s space flights. 

Directed the development and certification of the Shuttle space suit and portable life 
support system, as well as the in-space propulsion pack – the Manned Maneuvering 
Unit.
