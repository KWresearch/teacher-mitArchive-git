 

 
Dr. Jeffrey A. Hoffman is Professor of the Practice of Aerospace Engineering in the 
Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT. Dr. Hoffman received a B.A. 
(summa cum laude) from Amherst College in 1966 and a Ph.D. in astrophysics from 
Harvard University in 1971. He subsequently received a M.Sc. in Materials Science from 
Rice University in 1988. He spent one year as a post-doctoral fellow at the Smithsonian 
Astrophysical Observatory, after which he worked on the research staff of the Physics 
Department at Leicester University in the UK (1972-1975) and MIT’s Center for Space 
Research (1975-1978). He was a NASA astronaut from 1978-1997, having made five 
space flights and becoming the first astronaut to log 1000 hours of flight time aboard the 
Space Shuttle. Dr. Hoffman was Payload Commander of STS-46, the first flight of the 
US-Italian Tethered Satellite System. He played a key role in coordinating the scientific 
and operational teams working on this project. Dr. Hoffman has performed four 
spacewalks, including the first unplanned, contingency spacewalk in NASA’s history 
(STS 51D; April, 1985) and the initial repair/rescue mission for the Hubble Space 
Telescope (STS 61; December, 1993). He worked for several years as the Astronaut 
Office representative for EVA and helped develop and carry out tests of advanced high-
pressure space suit designs and of new tools and procedures needed for the assembly of 
the International Space Station. For several years, he was the astronaut office’s 
representative on the Payload Safety Panel. Following his astronaut career, Dr. Hoffman 
spent four years as NASA’s European Representative, based at the US Embassy in Paris, 
where his principal duties were to keep NASA and NASA’s European partners informed 
about each other’s activities, try to resolve problems in US-European space projects, 
search for new areas of US-European space cooperation, and represent NASA in 
European media. In August 2001, Dr. Hoffman joined the MIT faculty, where he teaches 
courses on space operations and design and space policy. Dr. Hoffman is director of the 
Massachusetts Space Grant Alliance, responsible for statewide space-related educational 
activities designed to increase public understanding of space and to attract students into 
aerospace careers. His principal areas of research are advanced EVA systems, space 
radiation protection, management of space science projects, and space systems 
architecture.
