1
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:11,570
Good morning.

2
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,370
I am filling in for Professor Hoffman who
is off addressing the French Parliament at

3
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,180
this moment, or maybe it was yesterday afternoon.

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,220
Tough choices of whether to stay here or go
there.

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,000
Well, that's right, Noah.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,689
These days the issue of knowing where you
are, navigation is really taken for granted.

7
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,980
We have GPS in our cell phones.

8
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,480
GPS in handheld devices.

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,480
GPS tells the taxi driver whether or not he
should be turning up that one way street.

10
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:48,100
When we began with human space travel, particularly
as we entered the Apollo era, the question

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,589
of navigation, along with guidance and control,
was still a major issue.

12
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:58,879
In fact, it was rather uncertain whether or
not, in the Apollo mission, we were going

13
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:05,879
to be able to, with assurance, do all of the
navigation required for going to lunar trajectory

14
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:14,390
and then doing the precise navigation to land
on

15
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,810
the moon.

16
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:30,810
The
history of leading guidance navigation and
control has now, for a period of over half

17
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:43,119
a century, been located just adjacent to,
at one time part of MIT, the Instrumentation

18
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,439
Laboratory, now Draper Laboratory.

19
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,030
And the tradition carried on through Apollo
to the Space Shuttle Program.

20
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,130
And then, as I think as you are aware, beyond
that into NASA's current plans.

21
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:02,090
We're privileged today to have discuss with
us the guidance, navigation and control issues

22
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,369
on the Shuttle, Dr. Phil Hattis.

23
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:12,369
Dr. Hattis, a graduate of Northwestern and
Caltech with his PhD from the Aero-Astro Department

24
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,510
at MIT, has been at Draper since 1974.

25
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,040
He is a member of the Laboratory Technical
Staff, which is the highest technical position

26
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,470
available there.

27
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:29,780
He serves as the Technical Lead for the Crew
Exploration Vehicle Development Program in

28
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,170
GN&C at Draper Laboratory.

29
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,410
Phil has been very active in AIAA.

30
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,270
He is a fellow.

31
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,430
He has been head of the New England region.

32
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:43,420
Has received the Draper Lab Distinguished
Performance Awards and various NASA recognition

33
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,800
awards for his contributions to STS-1 and
STS-8 missions.

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,880
Then we will hear about Draper's contributions
and the overall issue of GN&C.

35
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,840
Thanks a lot, Larry.

36
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,440
I should just point out, when I came up here
as a graduate student to pursue my doctorate,

37
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,770
I was a Draper fellow.

38
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:10,250
I started working on the Shuttle as a Draper
fellow, so much of the work I will be talking

39
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:15,120
about here, I was probably only a year or
two older than any of you when I was doing

40
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,750
this.

41
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:22,370
And that's turned out to be fairly useful
to NASA because with the Shuttle still flying

42
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,770
from time to time issues come up and they
stick pick my brain about what we did in 1974,

43
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:33,770
'75 and '76, which wouldn't had been so easy
if I had been at my current age then.

44
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,230
But it is also a little bit alarming because
it means the people that are working on the

45
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,700
system now don't really understand why it
was designed the way it is.

46
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,440
Now, the other thing they could have asked
me for was the report on which this material

47
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,830
was based, which I wrote in 1983 to educate
the rest of the people at Draper who were

48
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,250
going to work on the program subsequently
about this system.

49
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:58,540
Now, the other thing I just want to say is
feel free to interrupt me at any point to

50
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:58,890
ask questions.

51
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:03,260
I am going to be covering a lot of ground,
and I may not get back to the area that you're

52
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,660
interested in asking me about if you wait.

53
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:10,870
So just raise your hand or speak up or whatever
you feel like.

54
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:16,329
And the other things I want to point out are
two things.

55
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:21,250
One, what you're going to be looking is largely
what was done for the first Shuttle flight

56
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,940
except where I mention specific upgrades.

57
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,770
Now, I am not going to be comprehensively
covering all the upgrades that have been done

58
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,849
to the Shuttle since.

59
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:33,819
What you will also note is this presentation
will be largely monochrome.

60
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:34,509
And why?

61
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:39,060
Because it is drawn from a presentation of
1983 when there was no such thing as a laptop

62
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,900
or PowerPoint and color was a real pain to
get.

63
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:49,849
You had to go to the artist and then get it
lithographically reproduced which was an incredibly

64
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:51,550
cost.

65
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,900
What color you see, I've added now and it's
limited, except for a couple of pictures at

66
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,150
the end.

67
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,219
I do have some before and after cockpit pictures
at the end.

68
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:06,189
You will periodically see a chart like this,
topics of discussion, we'll go from section

69
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:10,240
to section and we're going to delineate the
areas I'm going to cover.

70
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,270
There are going to be a whole bunch of sub-bullets
for each of these areas as I go through.

71
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:18,189
This will be not real deep, unless you ask
me the questions and I will go as deep as

72
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:24,139
you want with the questions but covering a
lot of ground.

73
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:29,180
Some of these pictures you may have seen in
one form or another, but I should just highlight

74
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,180
certain points.

75
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,879
The systems related to the flight control
were placed all over the Shuttle.

76
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:40,759
In the forward area, which was the only pressurized
portion of the Shuttle, below the livable

77
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,289
areas was the avionics bay.

78
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:50,020
And, in there where the computers, the inertial
measurement unit, and I want to say something

79
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,509
about that in a moment, what they refer to
as multiplexers-demultiplexers.

80
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:57,789
You've got a lot of analog systems or you
had to convert back and forth between digital

81
00:05:57,789 --> 00:05:58,819
and analog.

82
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:05,819
And the electronic boxes that drove the commands
for the reaction control system thrusters.

83
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:11,539
And then you have hand controllers and displays
and indicators in the cockpit.

84
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:17,340
In the back you have pods which have many
of the reaction control system jets, the orbital

85
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,990
maneuvering system thrusters.

86
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,759
And I will be talking quite a bit more about
them later.

87
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:28,249
And there was also in the aft avionics bay
that had specific subsystems for which it

88
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:29,939
was deemed unacceptable to have them forward.

89
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:36,150
Some of them were local analog digital conversion
boxes, but also rate gyros which were used

90
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:41,620
during assent and entry where they wanted
them closer to the center of mass by being

91
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:47,659
in the back and in the front avoiding some
of the flexure issues associated with the

92
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:50,779
long distance to the front.

93
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:56,099
This particular configuration you're looking
at is before the external tank separated after

94
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:59,979
the solid rocket boosters had come off.

95
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:04,050
This configuration is where the story begins
because what I am going to be talking about

96
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:11,050
is the part that Draper did which is the exoatmospheric
flight control system.

97
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:16,580
And that begins at main engine shutdown and
ends when you hit 400,000 feet on the way

98
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:22,919
back.

99
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:25,629
There are different phases that we will be
talking about.

100
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:30,409
The first is what we refer to as insertion
which is from the time the main engines cut

101
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:35,360
off to the time you do initial orbit circularization.

102
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,360
And that includes a brief but design challenge
phase while you're attached to the external

103
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,249
tank.

104
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:46,689
It includes the separation maneuver from that.

105
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:52,120
And, in the original flight profile for the
Shuttle two burns of the orbital maneuvering

106
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:59,099
system, the original orbit insertion strategy
for the Shuttle put it in an orbit that typically

107
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:04,550
had an apogee of about 60 nautical miles,
a perigee of just a few nautical miles.

108
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,969
What you would do is the first burn would
raise that perigee up to the 100 plus nautical

109
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:13,499
mile target altitude and then the second burn
halfway around the earth would put you into

110
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:16,490
a circular orbit and then you would begin
your mission there.

111
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:23,490
Later in the program for overall efficiency,
in order to improve the payload margins, that

112
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:25,339
strategy changed.

113
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:31,439
And they tended to do more what they call
direct insertion which had a substantial higher

114
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:31,999
apogee.

115
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:38,169
The perigee wasn't much higher but you would
end up somewhere between those two.

116
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:43,850
And then you would do one OMS burn and you
would get a net gain of maybe one or two thousand

117
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,840
pounds which became very important.

118
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,830
During this insertion phase all the applicable
sensors were on.

119
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,840
Now, I said I was going to say something about
the IMU.

120
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,330
And most of you don't even think probably
these days about having rate gyro separate

121
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,790
from an inertial measurement unit.

122
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,900
You get these combined packages called inertial
navigation systems now.

123
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,830
They're actually navigators that have the
software.

124
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,530
They do all the processing for you.

125
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,260
They even have built in GPS receivers.

126
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,870
Of course, we didn't have GPS then.

127
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,790
The inertial measurement unit was a pretty
clunky gimbaled device at the time the Shuttle

128
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,770
first flew.

129
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:27,220
It subsequently got upgraded to ring laser
gyro systems.

130
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:34,220
But that inertial measurement unit was simply
outputting angles that were significant throughput

131
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:35,940
issues.

132
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,830
Because you had to do a lot of data crunching
to get rates from that.

133
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,380
Computers are really slow.

134
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,990
I will talk a little bit more about that in
a few minutes.

135
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:50,260
Having rate gyros separate was a way to get
data that these days would be all built into

136
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,460
one box.

137
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:57,050
General purpose computers, all of them were
on during ascent.

138
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:03,750
I will talk about the partisan of them, but
there were actually five of them.

139
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,680
And the Vernier reaction control system, which
is a small group of jets, and I will point

140
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,150
those out later, were not active.

141
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,700
The larger thrusters were.

142
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,730
And then, after the second OMS burn, you transition
to another flight phase.

143
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,290
And why all these flight phases, I will get
to in a couple minutes also.

144
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:24,650
Then orbit phase began after the second burn.

145
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,960
You quickly open the doors so that you could
dump waste heat.

146
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,760
The radiators are on the inside of the doors.

147
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,880
And, when the doors are closed, the heat just
radiates back into the vehicle.

148
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,190
All payload operations are during this phase.

149
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,650
And you did a lot of power down to save.

150
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,880
You're working off of fuel cells.

151
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,640
It limits your mission life both because of
the limits on the weight of the reactants

152
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,460
and on the places you can put any extra tanks.

153
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,270
So you turn off the rate gyros, you don't
need those anymore, and I will explain why.

154
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,600
Two of the five general purpose computers
were shut down.

155
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:05,100
This also being a late `70s computer design,
you're talking maybe on the order of a couple

156
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:12,100
hundred watts per computer which, by the way,
I will explain more about, but was a 104,000

157
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,370
word memory capacity.

158
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,680
That was actually an improvement from the
approach and landing test when it was 64,000

159
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,220
words.

160
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:30,830
And then you turned off two of the three redundant
inertial measurement units, except for critical

161
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,760
phases.

162
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:39,380
Also the safe power, the feeling was that
if you lost your navigation reference you

163
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,200
would have a relatively benign environment
to bring one of the others up.

164
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,000
And the Vernier thrusters were made available
because they were used for flying control.

165
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,970
Then you have the deorbit phase.

166
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,130
You close the doors again.

167
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,220
You do the deorbit burn.

168
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:59,160
You dump any residual propellant from the
forward tanks by simultaneously burning opposing

169
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:05,030
thrusters in order to get an acceptable center
of mass for entry.

170
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:09,060
Getting the acceptable location of the center
of mass for attitude and thermal control during

171
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,630
entry is very critical.

172
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,200
You reactive all the sensors.

173
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,610
You go back to all the computers being up.

174
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:24,020
Then you turn the Vernier jets back off and
you fly the vehicle using this mode until

175
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,910
you're at 400,000 feet which is about where
you pick up 0.05 Gs.

176
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:33,490
And that is where the entry phase takes over.

177
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,740
And this is just a summary of the profile.

178
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,260
Now, this is where I wanted to take the opportunity
to talk a little bit about computers and profiles

179
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,170
and everything else.

180
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,170
When we started this program with a 64,000
word computer, I talk in terms of words instead

181
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,340
of bytes.

182
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,860
The architecture of this computer didn't have
bytes.

183
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,420
You had words and half words.

184
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,920
Each word was equivalent to about four bytes
in terms of number of characters you could

185
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,540
insert into it.

186
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,400
But you only could break it down into pieces
of two.

187
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:13,400
So we had 208,000 - well, a thousand times
24 pieces of memory that we could work with

188
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,200
on this computer.

189
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,670
For the approach and landing test, which was
very limited, you flew it off of a 747 for

190
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:30,280
a couple of minutes, 64,000 words worked just
fine.

191
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,780
And they were chugging along with the program
saying we're going to get all this orbital

192
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,280
mission stuff into that computer.

193
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,920
And, of course, we discovered probably a year
after we really began the job, we began the

194
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,930
job seriously in '75, and by '76 it was obvious
64,000 words wasn't going to work.

195
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,490
They upped it to 104,000 words.

196
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:51,590
It was probably obvious four months later
that 104,000 words wasn't going to work.

197
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:58,010
So the solution, in addition to descoping
as much as possible, what you had to have

198
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:03,350
was to separate the computer loads that you
had for up and down which you did when you

199
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:07,060
were doing your orbital mission.

200
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,470
And then you had something called the mass
memory device which is basically a tape drive

201
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:14,840
which when you went from this phase to this
phase would reload some of the computers.

202
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,080
And then you went from this phase to this
phase we'd reload them again.

203
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,550
And I said there were five of these computers.

204
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:26,110
Four of them, of what I'll be talking about,
were the primary computer set.

205
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:33,110
Quad redundant so that they would vote all
data going in and out to decide whether or

206
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,960
not there was an inconsistency between one
computer and the other.

207
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,490
And it would automatically deselect the bad
computer, the implications of which I will

208
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:45,230
talk about probably about three-quarters of
the way through the presentation.

209
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:50,590
When you went up and down, all four computers
were operating the same software.

210
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,780
The fifth computer was called the backup flight
control system.

211
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:57,930
And the reason it was there, these four primary
computers, a chunk of that 104,000 words,

212
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:03,650
probably 30,000 to 40,000 words was used to
assure the computer set operated successfully

213
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,230
redundantly.

214
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,680
There was always a concern that there would
be a generic software error that would show

215
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,870
up at some bizarre time and that you could
pull down the whole computer set.

216
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:19,870
It was an independently coded similar architecture
from the standpoint of algorithm content,

217
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:27,680
but independently coded software called the
backup flight control system that on the hand

218
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,010
controller there was a button the crew could
hit, a panic button, if they needed to.

219
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,860
And the system would revert from the primary
system backup system.

220
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:41,060
It never happened in the history of the program,
it has never been used, but it is still there.

221
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:46,110
And so those five computers are all operating
on the way up and on the way down.

222
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:51,250
Now, when you go to the onboard phase, and
only three computers are up, you freeze dry,

223
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,900
as they say, to the computers.

224
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,660
One computer remains the backup flight computer
turned off ready to turn on from emergency

225
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,000
entry to backup.

226
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,180
The other one is a primary software load ready
to start.

227
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,590
The remaining three computers, two of them
were redundant set for the on-orbit functions.

228
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:12,030
And one of them, again, because of memory
problems, everything payload related was in

229
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:18,780
a system management and monitoring other non-flight
control related functions with one of the

230
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,480
other computers.

231
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:25,590
They did this spread of functions across computers,
in addition to adding the tape drive in order

232
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:30,870
to accommodate the memory constraints because
the Shuttle Mission was so much more complex

233
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:35,090
than what the computers were originally designed
to accommodate.

234
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,580
So you say it never happened.

235
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,250
Have there been instances in which any of
the backup computers have been brought online?

236
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,820
There have been instances in which primary
computers have failed.

237
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,150
There has never been an instance in which
they've reverted to the backup system.

238
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:55,870
Now, when the primary systems fail, and I
will elaborate this in more detail, while

239
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:01,510
each computer computes the functionality for
everything, they only control more or less

240
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,860
a quarter of the subsystems.

241
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,620
And there is a distribution.

242
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,909
And some of the charts towards the end will
talk about how this was done.

243
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:11,980
And there are implications associated with
what you lose when the computer goes down.

244
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:17,220
But, if you have time in your noncritical
flight phase, you can restring those things

245
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,990
to the remaining healthy computers and recover
accessible systems even though that computer

246
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,399
has gone down.

247
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:29,399
Now, on STS-9, that was incidentally our MIT
department's first Shuttle flight.

248
00:17:29,499 --> 00:17:31,350
And it had, Byron Lichtenberg, one of our
people.

249
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,360
And what turned out happened to be floating
solder balls and an early version of these

250
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,039
computers that caused intermittent shorts.

251
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,960
And one computer went down before entry.

252
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,889
They recovered the string.

253
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:48,519
Another computer went down during entry.

254
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:53,590
And, because they had reconfigured the string,
they had three of the four strings left but

255
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,909
only two computers.

256
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,360
And another one failed on touchdown.

257
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:04,929
And had that one failed before touchdown they
probably would have reverted to the backup

258
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:05,179
system.

259
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,460
That's the closest they ever came to a backup
system.

260
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,350
Now, the question that comes to my mind there,
since the generic failure was not software

261
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:16,370
but floating solder balls, which all the computers
were susceptible to, what would have happened

262
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,350
if they had gone to the backup system?

263
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,429
Because it could have gone down, too, and
then they would have had nothing.

264
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:26,850
Because, once they've gone to the backup,
it is not easy to revert in critical flight

265
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,389
phase to the primary system.

266
00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:32,970
Lichtenberg, as I mentioned, was a crew member
from our lab.

267
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,759
Later I asked him how did he feel when the
first computer went down and then the second

268
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:37,950
computer went down?

269
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,220
Byron has an aero-astro PhD and pretty savvy.

270
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,389
He said he was pretty worried until he looked
at the commander, who was John Young, and

271
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:51,019
John said well, we might as well go to sleep
because we're not going to reenter today.

272
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:54,870
And when John went to sleep he said he might
as well go to sleep, too, and it will be all

273
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,860
right.

274
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,850
And it was.

275
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:59,850
Yes?

276
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,149
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] The computer was the same.

277
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:05,769
The software was not.

278
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:09,149
The computers themselves are all interchangeable
AP101 computers.

279
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:15,409
Subsequently, they were changed to AP101S
computers, which is modified version that

280
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:17,120
was used on the B-1 Bomber.

281
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,299
And they went to 256,000 words of memory.

282
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:21,879
And that is the current state-of-the-art.

283
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:26,399
You have to understand several things.

284
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:29,289
One, it is very expensive to upgrade systems
that are already flying.

285
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:35,299
But, independent of that, you never fly in
space something that is close to the state-of-the-art

286
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:39,909
because you have to go through all the qualifications,
which takes a lot of time, and it has to be

287
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:41,490
radiation hardened when you're in space.

288
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,570
And when it's a human vehicle, it has also
got to go through human qualification.

289
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:52,570
The Space Station architecture is IBM 386
processor quality, so it is basically like

290
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:03,220
maybe about 1986, '87 early laptop generation
computers.

291
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:10,539
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] Oh, yes.

292
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,090
There were quite a few missions.

293
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,629
I don't think there have ever been any missions
where they lost two.

294
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:21,690
The IMU failures don't seem to have been anything
systemic but just sort of a random problem.

295
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:26,710
And I'm not sure since they have gone to the
ring laser gyro systems that they have had

296
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:26,999
any failures.

297
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:33,759
I think it was the mechanical ones from the
early days that they had some problems.

298
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:36,519
Now, major requirements for the systems.

299
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:39,940
We had two different autopilots for three
phase transmission which incorporated both

300
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:45,610
the insertion and the orbit features and on-orbit,
so we only had two different software loads

301
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:49,710
on that tape drive for the primary flight
control system.

302
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:54,830
The rules for Shuttle were that after any
subsystem failure you have the capability

303
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,330
to remain operational.

304
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,309
No critical functions were lost.

305
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:04,330
After two failures, safe operation, all critical
things necessary to terminate the mission

306
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,119
and bring them home would be possible.

307
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:13,119
But some of the mission objectives may not
be achievable.

308
00:21:14,129 --> 00:21:21,129
The system was mainly aimed at controlling
rigid body characteristics and velocity changes

309
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:22,639
within specification.

310
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:27,039
Only when we started to look at docking with
the mirror in the Space Station did we start

311
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,899
worrying about flexible body effects.

312
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:32,460
And it was because of what they were attaching
to and not because of the Shuttle, all those

313
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,740
appendages and those things.

314
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,980
If Shuttle does control Space Station and
did control Mir when it was docked.

315
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,610
And so there have been some modes, which I
won't really be talking about today, but were

316
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:49,610
created to facilitate that control without
causing unacceptable loads on those flexible

317
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,960
appendages of the stations.

318
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,009
And 80 millisecond app cycle, two reasons
that happened.

319
00:21:58,009 --> 00:21:59,909
We originally planned to do 40 milliseconds.

320
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:02,149
The approach and landing test program was.

321
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:07,169
First there is less process of burden if you
do it half as often.

322
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:12,990
And the other, when it came to the reaction
control system, as we discovered in about

323
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:19,990
early 1980, a little more than a year before
the first flight that there was a water hammer

324
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:27,340
effect in the propellant lines on the RCS
jets were the opening of the valves caused

325
00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:32,789
an expansion wave which reflected as a compression
wave.

326
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:34,549
The closing of the valves caused a compression
wave.

327
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:39,110
The inner section compression waves, if the
valves were opened and closed too quickly,

328
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:43,399
could cause a catastrophically large compression
wave that could burst the line.

329
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:49,450
So they deemed it better rather than redesign
the entire feed system to limit us to never

330
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:53,269
firing faster than 80 millisecond cycles.

331
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:55,159
Now, that differed from Apollo.

332
00:22:55,159 --> 00:23:00,080
Apollo had 100 millisecond cycle time, but
they had the ability to interrupt the cycle

333
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,879
to turn out enough jets if they wanted a short
firing.

334
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:08,289
We couldn't do that because of the water hammer
effect.

335
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:15,289
And also because the propellant feed system
involved a liquid in the tank with zero G

336
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,059
acquisition devices around the surface of
the tank directly exposed to the pressured

337
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:28,119
helium, which means some of the helium dissolved
into the fluid.

338
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:34,779
If the fluid was drawn too fast the helium
could bubble out causing a gap in those zero

339
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:38,059
G acquisition devices around the tank preventing
flow.

340
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:44,019
If you get unbalanced flow of hypergolic propulsion
systems you can also get an explosion.

341
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:47,850
So the solution to that was limiting how many
jets you could fire at one time off of one

342
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:48,299
tank.

343
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:51,429
Does everybody understand what the zero G
acquisition problem is?

344
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,610
It's a surface tension base.

345
00:23:53,610 --> 00:24:00,610
You have various types of rings and shapes
on there that captured fluid by surface tension

346
00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:04,320
to there, which would begin to draw the fluid.

347
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,830
And once you began to get some flow because
of firing things it would pull the blobs of

348
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:15,379
fluid into the tanks and into the feed lines
from the tanks.

349
00:24:15,379 --> 00:24:17,340
As you recall, the origin of the problem is
that the fluid would not be at the bottom

350
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,730
of the tank so you risk drawing a bubble.

351
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:26,129
The surface tension holds enough there to
start the firing.

352
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:27,679
When you fire you get some force.

353
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,659
The force draws the blob to the same parts
of the tanks where you can acquire the fluid.

354
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:38,019
And, as long as you don't draw too fast, the
communication between that part of the tank

355
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:38,809
and the fluid remains.

356
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:42,529
This was a very complicated qualification
program.

357
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:49,529
A lot of C135 parabolic trajectory time got
used to test out various perturbating of the

358
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:50,759
inside of the tanks.

359
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:54,239
And I am not going to talk about that in detail
but I'm sure there are a lot of papers out

360
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:58,110
in the literature about how they qualified
these things.

361
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:03,429
And I don't think there were too many systems
before the Shuttle that actually did it this

362
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:03,960
way.

363
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,529
One used systems that tended to use membranes
where you had the pressure on one side and

364
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:15,529
the fluid on the other side, and the membrane
would just force the fluid to stay in contact.

365
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:22,639
But the problem is the membranes would degrade
over time on exposure to these hypergolic

366
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:23,769
propellants.

367
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:29,070
Hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide are very
chemical reactive materials.

368
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,480
For instance, it was supposed to be used over
many years up to a hundred times.

369
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,259
The idea that you would have periodically
keep opening up these tanks to change a membrane

370
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:39,610
was not attractive when you consider the tanks
are deep inside of the structure.

371
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:44,549
So this may have been a unique issue because
of a reusable system, but it also may be relevant

372
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:51,549
to systems that even if they aren't reusable
have to have a very long life in space.

373
00:25:54,999 --> 00:26:00,419
Modes and submodes I will quickly go through,
but you have rotation and translation modes.

374
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:07,419
These modes could be used simultaneously for
the RCS system and then separately for the

375
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,899
OMS system.

376
00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:18,899
And you had special modes which to get extra
oomph out of the RCS jets, if you had an abort,

377
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:26,049
that would sometimes be done if the OMS engineers
weren't available.

378
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:33,049
The OMS engines, there were two of them which
were up on the back right and left pods from

379
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,799
that picture I showed a few minutes ago.

380
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,350
And you could use one or two depending on
what you were doing.

381
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:44,129
And in the RCS rotation modes, you had various
ways you could use it.

382
00:26:44,129 --> 00:26:46,749
Proportional meant you moved the stick.

383
00:26:46,749 --> 00:26:51,419
The response you get is in proportion to what
you do, how long the jets fire.

384
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:55,419
Discrete means you move the stick and you
get a specific amount of rate change.

385
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:58,570
Pulse means you just get a single little pulse
out.

386
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:03,100
And acceleration means as long as you're holding
the stick out it keeps firing them.

387
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:03,989
And those are all.

388
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:08,309
There were push button displays that the crew
could adjust.

389
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:13,200
There were some modes for each of those which
affected how many jets fired, whether or not

390
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,259
you wanted to force it to use something that
approximated couples or you were in propellant

391
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:22,600
conservation mode and you were willing to
get accept getting a rotation rate.

392
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,669
With coupled in the translation you would
care about that effect.

393
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:32,369
And in the translation there were various
submodes as well.

394
00:27:32,369 --> 00:27:36,580
And, in particular, you would use more jets
when you were separating from the external

395
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,249
tank to get away as fast as possible.

396
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:38,499
Yes?

397
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:41,999
On the previous slide, are there different
modes for the RCS jets?

398
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:47,869
Was there one that they happened to use the
most or was like supposed to be the primary

399
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:51,279
usage or are they all part of the normal operating?

400
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,739
I think they would rarely use this or this.

401
00:27:55,739 --> 00:27:59,600
I think these two were commonly used.

402
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,710
This is very fuel inefficient.

403
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,330
It would only be used as kind of an emergency
measure.

404
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:08,100
That's also very difficult from the point
of view of the pilot to have direct acceleration

405
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,350
control.

406
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:08,519
Right.

407
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,389
I mean this might be something you would call
upon if actually, for some reason, the vehicle

408
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:17,570
started to spin up unexpectedly and you would
have to neutralize that.

409
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,669
Does that adequately answer your question
for now?

410
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:26,499
There will be an opportunity to collect a
little more detail on that later.

411
00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:30,749
But, again, you wanted to get off the tank
quickly so you would use all the jets you

412
00:28:30,749 --> 00:28:32,739
had to get off of it.

413
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:35,609
You wouldn't do that later.

414
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:40,259
You would have more jets that you would use
for roll control while you're on the tank

415
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:43,529
because you had a much higher roll inertia.

416
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:46,590
You want to only spend a few seconds on the
tank after the main engines shut down.

417
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,220
You could often be left with residual rates
you've got to quickly kill.

418
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:53,009
There was an inhibit on the separation if
you had more than half a degree per second

419
00:28:53,009 --> 00:28:53,960
on each of the axes.

420
00:28:53,960 --> 00:29:00,940
There was actually a phenomenon on the first
Shuttle flight which almost got us in trouble.

421
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:07,549
One of the first things that happens after
the main engines shut down is you slew the

422
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:12,429
engines back to stow position where you want
the engines for entry.

423
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:16,320
The reason is the auxiliary power units are
needed to move the main engines.

424
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,529
You want to shut those down and save the hydrazine
for those until you get back to it just before

425
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:21,879
entry.

426
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:27,190
On the first Shuttle flight they kicked those
engines at about one hertz.

427
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:31,070
It turned out the first fundamental mode,
the rock mode of the orbiter on the external

428
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:38,070
tank had a subharmonic of about almost exactly
one-fourth of that slew rate on the main engines.

429
00:29:38,749 --> 00:29:44,309
The slewing of the engines then causes the
rocky mode to be excited.

430
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:49,679
We were seeing oscillations very close to
the inhibit for the separation.

431
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,179
The crew was getting a little worried but
we just got it in bounds in the automatic

432
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:54,600
mode.

433
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,460
And if they hadn't separated in time it would
have gotten pretty complicated to do it manually.

434
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,909
We made quite a few changes after that.

435
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:05,580
There were a lot of things we learned on the
first flight, and I will point a few of them

436
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,450
out as we go along.

437
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:10,379
There was also a launch pad phenomenology.

438
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:13,739
It is not part of my talk.

439
00:30:13,739 --> 00:30:18,299
Has this come up in the class about the shockwave
from the SRB ignition?

440
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:19,029
Yes.

441
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:19,759
OK.

442
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:23,679
They didn't have those waterbeds in there
on the first flight.

443
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,950
What was relevant here, one of the things
that you may or may not know is that the struts

444
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:33,399
that held the forward RCS tanks on the first
flight were buckled almost to failure.

445
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:36,039
That wasn't realized until they got home,
but had they failed they probably would have

446
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:42,059
burst and blown up the vehicle.

447
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:49,059
The on-orbit modes, we have both primary and
Vernier jets which were only used separately,

448
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:55,190
except under special circumstances which were
designed substantially after the first flight.

449
00:30:55,190 --> 00:31:02,190
We have local, vertical and inertial frame
of reference control capability with respect

450
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:04,759
to the discrete rate mode.

451
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:11,059
And, otherwise, it is pretty similar to what
you saw in the previous picture.

452
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:16,950
And submodes, some features were added because
of rendezvous.

453
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,679
You could fire a lot of jets on the fort side.

454
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,979
If you wanted to do a rapid breaking, you
could inhibit all the jets to fire in that

455
00:31:23,979 --> 00:31:24,229
direction.

456
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:29,220
If you wanted to limit the use of plumes,
it turns out that you didn't lose completely

457
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,690
your translation control authority.

458
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:37,269
Because the jets, in the front and back, that
were in the x-axis coupled about 20% of the

459
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:38,399
trust into the z-axis.

460
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,700
So if you fired them simultaneously in both
directions you could avoid pluming an object

461
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:49,700
in front of you and still get enough translation
to control that axis.

462
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:57,019
And, just to show how everything was hooked
up, the inertial measurement units and rate

463
00:31:57,019 --> 00:32:04,019
gyros and hand controllers and panel controls
all went in through these multiplexer devices

464
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:13,429
feeding the signals then into the computer
and displays.

465
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:20,450
And then you had outputs going through these
similar types of electronic boxes specific

466
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:24,629
to the reaction control jets that generated
the commands that were needed by the solenoid

467
00:32:24,629 --> 00:32:31,629
valves that actually opened and closed the
hypergolic feed lines.

468
00:32:33,879 --> 00:32:39,049
Looking at the whole top level architecture
then of the GN&C system is all those boxes

469
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:41,269
feeding into what was inside of the computer.

470
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:46,519
Inside of the computer you have subsystem
operation software managing each of the subsystems

471
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:49,100
doing the redundancy management.

472
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,830
The specific guidance navigation control algorithms.

473
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:58,739
There was a moding and sequencing function
which was based on both manual and automatic

474
00:32:58,739 --> 00:33:02,029
scripts.

475
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:06,519
Then the actual driving of the displays of
controls is interactive with the flight control

476
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:13,519
system both ways providing feedback to the
crew members and accepting their inputs.

477
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:21,359
And then what was left was the system management
function on this computer that didn't go into

478
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,970
the separate computer.

479
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:29,210
By the way, anything related to robotic arm
operations were operated through that separate

480
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:29,710
computer.

481
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:33,769
One of the issues that came along later in
the program is the flight control computer

482
00:33:33,769 --> 00:33:35,470
never knew what was happening with the arm.

483
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:40,109
If you take a space telescope sized payload
and put it 40 feet out there, it drastically

484
00:33:40,109 --> 00:33:40,999
changes the mass properties.

485
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:47,369
And one of the features you will see a little
later that we stuck in was the ability for

486
00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:52,100
the crew, by pushbutton, to select different
tables about expected accelerations of the

487
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,109
jets because we didn't know when we needed
to respond to that.

488
00:33:56,109 --> 00:34:01,739
There were also flexure issues with the arm
which came up as they went along, too, and

489
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:04,639
established constraints on how we operated.

490
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:09,500
But was there any thought given to having
an adaptive system which would identify the

491
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,070
current parameters?

492
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:16,909
That would have gone way beyond the capacity
of the computers that we had.

493
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:22,569
It would be relatively easy to do with the
programs we had but it would never fit in

494
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:25,289
a 104k memory computer.

495
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:31,859
But there has been lots of work that some
of my graduate students have done over the

496
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:34,960
years of how we should have done that.

497
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,780
Brent Appleby, who is now a division leader
at the Lab, actually did some work back in

498
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:47,780
the `80s, I think that may have been his master's
thesis, on some of those issues.

499
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:56,520
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] But, in reality, we're
approaching very large memories which would

500
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:01,549
allow you to do it.

501
00:35:01,549 --> 00:35:05,460
Well, when we go into CEV, we're probably
going to assume that 100 megabytes is no big

502
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,539
deal.

503
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:13,319
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] unfortunately was cancelled,
but we were doing exactly that.

504
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:17,900
We knew exactly the position [NOISE OBSCURES]
all the movement when we were grappling.

505
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:23,549
And we were changing all the tables based
on the current angles [NOISE OBSCURES].

506
00:35:23,549 --> 00:35:29,440
It is a real challenge to maintain stability
on a system where you have no insight into

507
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,220
that.

508
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:35,260
But you would never build a spacecraft that
way today so I'm not sure.

509
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:40,030
The challenges we have are very interesting
but probably no longer relevant.

510
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:45,230
The challenges that remain are the flexural
dynamic interaction problems.

511
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:52,230
I just wanted to indicate that within the
control laws you have a steering processor,

512
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:57,760
which I will talk a little bit about more,
an RCS jet processor, a state estimator and

513
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,690
an OMS processor.

514
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,589
The state estimator is unique to the on-orbit
flight.

515
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:06,109
And there is more that represents that in
a minute.

516
00:36:06,109 --> 00:36:12,230
So I am going to now, having entered the overview,
go into each of the subsystems in more detail

517
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:19,230
by pulling up this picture to talk about it
a little more, these subsystems in the context.

518
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:28,140
The forward RCS system had 14 primary 870
pound jets and two Vernier 24 pound jets.

519
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,900
There were 24 and 4 respectively.

520
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,079
Those systems in back evenly divided left
and right.

521
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:43,980
Each of the pods in the back had one OMS engine.

522
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:50,420
The forward RCS system had its own self-contained
hypergolic tanks.

523
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:57,420
The aft system had RCS tanks and OMS tanks
which could be interconnected from within

524
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,589
the pod or could be cross-fed across the pods.

525
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:08,559
Now, the consequence to the flight control
system, there were different constraints and

526
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,210
simultaneous jet firings.

527
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:15,880
And how you counted, whether it was only left
or right or both, depending on which mode

528
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,410
you were in, if you had a mission and needed
a lot of RCS propellant and you had spare

529
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:24,280
space in the OMS tanks, it allowed benefiting
from that.

530
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,450
Why are there so many thrusters pointing in
the same direction?

531
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,390
For redundancy?

532
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:33,130
Yes, redundancy and maximum control authority.

533
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:38,380
You want to find control authority normally
with redundancy but for external tank separation

534
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,609
you wanted high acceleration in one direction.

535
00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:45,740
For high rendezvous breaking you wanted high
acceleration in the other direction plus or

536
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,000
minus Z.

537
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And for backup to the OMS engine you wanted
to have higher acceleration in the plus X

538
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,020
direction.

539
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:01,000
And then, when you were doing entry, which
I'm not talking about today, you had an on-demand

540
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,240
RCS control authority in the upper atmosphere
during hypersonic flight.

541
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:11,010
And you would turn on one, two, three or four
yaw thrusters in particular as needed.

542
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:16,690
I think one, two, and occasionally three thrusters
had been turned on during disturbances.

543
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:21,750
One of the things we've learned from the telemetry
of the Columbia accident is as this vehicle

544
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,650
was falling apart for probably 20 or 30 seconds,
the vehicle was controlling very nicely because

545
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,480
they kept turning on more and more jets.

546
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,089
They were getting major torque imbalances
from missing pieces of the vehicle.

547
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:36,740
But it was still controlling the attitude
until the damage got so severe that was no

548
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,920
longer possible.

549
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:47,920
Again, I already talked about the number of
the thrusters.

550
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,829
The primary thrusters, for the reasons we
talked about, there were many jets.

551
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:57,349
And also because translation and rotation
control was accommodated by these Verniers,

552
00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:01,690
a feature I will mention briefly later.

553
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:05,440
It was only a rotation control system and
fundamentally does not have redundancy.

554
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,880
I already talked about the on-time.

555
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:14,270
These are just typical propellant loads and
thrust levels and specific impulse numbers.

556
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:19,690
You notice that large maneuvers are always
a little more efficiently done with the primary

557
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,770
jets and even more efficiently still with
the OMS as you will see in another chart.

558
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:29,289
Life for duty cycles and on-time are relevant
for a vehicle that is going to fly a lot of

559
00:39:29,289 --> 00:39:31,829
missions.

560
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:34,829
Flying control almost always will be done
with Vernier jets, not just because of propellant,

561
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:40,940
which it is much more efficient, but also
because you will get a lot more mission life

562
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,240
out of it.

563
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,150
This is a stick drawing of those.

564
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,720
There is a numbering system associated with
it.

565
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,980
FRL for which pot it's in.

566
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,910
Up, down, forward, right, left.

567
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:57,829
The last character for which direction it
fires.

568
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:01,010
And then the middle number is a manifold.

569
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,960
If you see a five that is the Vernier jets.

570
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:09,250
One, two, three or four, any pod that has
got the same middle number is on one manifold.

571
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:14,630
If a failure shut that manifold or a string
took down that manifold, all of those jets

572
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,279
were lost.

573
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:21,589
When you lose a string, you would have one
manifold per pod that you would lose.

574
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:25,220
That means under some circumstance, because
the Vernier system is redundant, a single

575
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,349
failure could take that out.

576
00:40:26,349 --> 00:40:32,309
But that wasn't critical to carrying out most
mission objectives or to safety.

577
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:38,660
That is probably enough said on that.

578
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:45,660
The OMS, typical propellant loads mentioned
here.

579
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:47,369
On-time, never less than two seconds.

580
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:52,779
Never less than, with one engine, 12,000 pound
second impulse with a 6,000 pound thrust not

581
00:40:52,779 --> 00:40:55,920
suitable for fine maneuvers.

582
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,010
The RCS jets would always be used to trim
out any large OMS burn errors.

583
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:04,339
Had a significantly higher specific impulse.

584
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:09,000
For large maneuvers you're clearly better
off from a propellant weight perspective using

585
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,400
that system.

586
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:18,400
Each of the engines had redundant gimbal control,
redundant by having one mechanical screw system,

587
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:23,859
but you could drive the nut or you could drive
the screw.

588
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:26,680
And there were different electrical systems
that did that.

589
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,299
This was the maximum authority.

590
00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:34,270
And the two axes at each engine could move
a portion of which was used to tract the center

591
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:39,730
of mass as the vehicle consumed propellant
or delivered payloads and a portion of which

592
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:43,869
was for actual thrust vector control management.

593
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:45,220
We also had to subtract a little bit.

594
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:48,539
You never want to go too close to the hard
stops because you risk mechanical failure

595
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:49,770
by doing that.

596
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:54,520
And you always have a little bit of mechanical
uncertainty of exactly where you are anyway.

597
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,740
A portion of that was a mechanical uncertainty
and a portion of that was just a mechanical

598
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,369
safety margin.

599
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:08,369
This is a drawing in the two different planes
of the rotation of the engines showing the

600
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:16,029
span between the center, say about 15 feet
apart, no surprise given the general cross-section

601
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:17,289
of the Shuttle.

602
00:42:17,289 --> 00:42:24,059
An important thing to notice is that the engine,
while I can point through the CG, is not pointing

603
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:27,010
anywhere near the body access of the vehicle.

604
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:33,289
And, by the way, the vehicle body axes weren't
-- There was a significant offset between

605
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:40,289
the principle axis of the vehicle and the
body axis component of inertia, and the body

606
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:47,970
axis was quite large.

607
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:52,799
Three units, even with the replacements they
have gone through over the years, there remains

608
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:59,799
three units for the INSs now, but the IMU
where mechanical systems with quanta for knowledge

609
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,440
of state which were not all that small.

610
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,789
And the RGAs were even worse, the rate gyros.

611
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,390
These quanta were quite significant.

612
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:20,240
The reason was we had a half-word in that
multiplexity multiplexer for translating the

613
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:25,619
analog signal to a digital signal which determined,
based on the maximum range, the maximum range

614
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:30,869
being dictated by maneuver rates where possible
during ascent and entry and not on orbit.

615
00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:33,420
But we were stuck with that.

616
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,740
It was hardwired into the cards.

617
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:42,740
And so these quanta then, we discovered there
was a one sigma probability of an every third

618
00:43:45,799 --> 00:43:51,029
cycle one quanta noise spike on the data that
came across the MDMs.

619
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:54,940
And that was pretty significant when we were
trying to do fine control during the transition

620
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,829
phase.

621
00:43:56,829 --> 00:44:03,829
Were the noise levels determined by this quantization,
in effect, the [NOISE OBSCURES]?

622
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,750
The noise phenomenology was related to the
electronics of the card, but it was directly

623
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:17,520
related to the least significant byte.

624
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,279
But the mechanical sensors themselves were
superior to that?

625
00:44:21,279 --> 00:44:22,210
Yes, they were.

626
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:24,890
It was the MDM card that introduced the noise.

627
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:31,890
If you had used one word from the MDMs that
would have [NOISE OBSCURES]?

628
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:40,329
Given the state-of-the-art to have processed
that much information across the MDMs would

629
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:43,260
have made it too slow.

630
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:50,140
We're talking orders of magnitude slower electronics
from the late `70s than you have today, so

631
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:57,140
the half-word was dictated by the data rates
that we required of these boxes.

632
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:06,079
Now I'm going to go into specific features
on the software side.

633
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:06,869
Yeah?

634
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:11,630
With the gyros, it seems on Hubble and Station,
for example, we always hear bad news on the

635
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:18,630
gyros having to be replaced every so often.

636
00:45:20,109 --> 00:45:24,549
Well, first of all, what I'm talking about
here, at the time the Shuttle first flew,

637
00:45:24,549 --> 00:45:26,559
are mechanical gyros.

638
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:28,400
Hubble may have started mechanical gyros.

639
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,589
They have been changed out at least once or
twice.

640
00:45:30,589 --> 00:45:34,529
And are probably fiber optic systems.

641
00:45:34,529 --> 00:45:40,180
Hubble has the problem that it's in a fairly
high orbit, 300 plus nautical miles high for

642
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,170
the Shuttle anyway.

643
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:46,289
It has a significant radiation exposure, particularly
when it goes through the South Atlantic Anomaly

644
00:45:46,289 --> 00:45:50,430
of the radiation belts which are 300 nautical
miles.

645
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:54,119
Much more time they spend on that than at
100 nautical miles.

646
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:59,299
Cumulative radiation damage to the electronics
in those gyros is probably a contributing

647
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:06,299
factor to the failure rates that they're seeing
on Hubble.

648
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:12,170
I would say they must spend a few percentage
of their time in the South Atlantic Anomaly

649
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:14,420
at that altitude.

650
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:21,420
Are the gyro replacements we're talking about
measurement gyros or attitude control gyros?

651
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:30,170
Well, the fine guidance gyros are the ones
that have been the big problem on the Hubble.

652
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:37,230
We're talking about quantitatively a different
regime we're operating here.

653
00:46:37,529 --> 00:46:42,369
The quantization, take away the noise effects,
was something we could live with for operating

654
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:43,099
the flight control system.

655
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:47,140
In Hubble, you want to be able to measure
rates two or three orders of magnitude lower

656
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:50,470
than what we're talking about here.

657
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:54,890
The actual design of the sensors is substantially
different because they're trying to get very,

658
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,640
very tiny little rates out.

659
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:02,579
These are trying to maintain the image lock
when you're using the full magnification capability

660
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:08,170
of the telescope and whatever target that
it has.

661
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:12,940
Nevertheless, I would imagine that if the
Shuttle gyros are staying at 300 nautical

662
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:19,940
miles for five to ten years, they would fail,
too.

663
00:47:21,559 --> 00:47:23,910
Radiation is one of the fundamental drivers
for all missions.

664
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:28,500
And it often that Atlantic Anomaly is one
of the big drivers for low inclination.

665
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,020
Space telescopes are 28.5 degree inclinations.

666
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:34,119
So they don't have to deal with the magnetic
fields coming in toward the poles which a

667
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:39,819
polar mission has to, but there is this big
dip in the Van Allen Belts off the coast of

668
00:47:39,819 --> 00:47:46,789
South America which poses a problem for everything
that isn't low orbit.

669
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:53,789
The functionality we have in the autopilot,
we use the rate gyros and the inertial measurement

670
00:47:54,549 --> 00:48:00,400
unit on the transitioned app to get states
direction giving us altitude, giving us rate.

671
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:06,420
On orbit we have the gyro shutdown to conserve
power, view data only.

672
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:12,869
That then dictates that we are going to have
a state estimator on orbit.

673
00:48:12,869 --> 00:48:16,829
We have to put some special features to overcome
the rate gyro noise in the transition phase,

674
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:20,010
which is irrelevant when the rate gyros aren't
operating in the on-orbit phase.

675
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:24,769
We have the Vernier jets and the associated
algorithm logic for on-orbit which isn't in

676
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:26,970
the transition phase.

677
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:32,769
We worry a lot more about every detail propellant
deficiency on-orbit because we spend so much

678
00:48:32,769 --> 00:48:33,760
more time there.

679
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:39,700
We have a lot of features we've added to minimize
propellant there.

680
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:46,700
The OMS capability in the two phases is actually
identical with both of them having a capability

681
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:51,799
to wrap around the RCS jets to the thrust
vector control should the thrust vector control

682
00:48:51,799 --> 00:48:55,150
not behave properly during that OMS burn.

683
00:48:55,150 --> 00:49:01,690
And this just delineates the various features
we have for steering.

684
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:03,250
OMS and RCS.

685
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:07,690
Where we add lots more features because there
are a lot more things you are attempting to

686
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:13,170
track when you're doing your mission on orbit
than when you're just trying to get to and

687
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:18,049
from orbit.

688
00:49:18,049 --> 00:49:19,430
Notice the rates that we're talking about.

689
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:26,010
Typically, you look at an INS box these days
and you see hundreds of hertz data rates.

690
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:30,640
What restricted us here was how fast could
we -- For instance, none of the software was

691
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,150
in the sensor package.

692
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:35,170
It was in our computer.

693
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:38,710
And we had a severe throughput problem.

694
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:45,220
And the solution, since we had the rate gyros
for rates and we only needed the IMUs for

695
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:51,680
attitudes, and rates could be used to extrapolate
attitudes for a reasonable period of time,

696
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:57,319
was to greatly reduce the processing rate
of the IMU down to on the order of one hertz,

697
00:49:57,319 --> 00:49:59,510
submultiple of 25 hertz which is why it is
1.04.

698
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:06,510
On orbit, since it was our only source of
information, we had to eat a larger processing

699
00:50:09,529 --> 00:50:16,380
burden, operating on a 6.25 hertz, but we
still were extrapolating in between the state

700
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,390
estimate of one time constant.

701
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:20,940
We'll talk a little bit about what we're doing
with that, but everything down here is operating

702
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:23,779
at 12.5 and we're getting the data in at 6.25.

703
00:50:23,779 --> 00:50:30,500
There are a lot of things you would do differently
simply because you don't have these low rate

704
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:37,500
constraints due to throughput limits.

705
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:43,849
The architecture then for the autopilot that
is being representative on orbit is you would

706
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:48,410
have a maneuver module where all the features
for steering the vehicle would be, kind of

707
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:50,010
an adjunct to guidance.

708
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:53,960
You would have these modes controlled by the
crew and the push button display of what the

709
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,260
stick deflections would do.

710
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:01,019
You would have the phase plane which would
be tracking attitude error, rate error and

711
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:07,039
whether or not you should fire jets as a function
of those errors separate per axis.

712
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:10,859
Are there people here that don't know about
phase planes?

713
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:11,549
OK.

714
00:51:11,549 --> 00:51:16,990
Well, the concept of the phase plane, you
go to optimal control theory and you look

715
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:23,990
into a situation where you have a control
effector which is on or off by directional,

716
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:25,869
which is what thrusters are.

717
00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:31,730
And you look at what it takes, given an error
in a plane which is attitude error and rate

718
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:38,730
error, and you want to get minimum time to
neutralize that error to zero.

719
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:47,730
51:35 But you have
lots of dead zones, which I will talk about
more, to assure that you don't inefficiently

720
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:09,069
use the jets so that you are not constantly
trying to fire the jets to get exactly to

721
00:52:09,069 --> 00:52:12,680
the origin which is never possible.

722
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,920
The state estimator, which is a form of a
Kalman filter.

723
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,769
And then the jet selection logic which is
essentially for the primary jet lookup tables.

724
00:52:20,769 --> 00:52:27,769
But it turned out to probably be the first
use of real based intelligence.

725
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:29,849
We didn't think about these things in that
time.

726
00:52:29,849 --> 00:52:34,390
And, when I talk about the stringing later,
I think we were also using an early version

727
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:36,980
of failure tree analysis.

728
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:43,980
But, in the 1970s, none of these things were
named.

729
00:52:44,109 --> 00:52:50,430
And then you have various loads for the parameters
that determine these dead zones and tables

730
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:50,680
and all that.

731
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:57,490
And the crew would select these from push
button displays.

732
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:05,500
For the OMS, you could either have hand controller
inputs or cross-product steering and based

733
00:53:06,339 --> 00:53:13,339
guidance inputs which would then go into roll
and pitch and yaw.

734
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:23,900
Thrust vector processing channels were roll
and pitch coupled.

735
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:28,410
Roll is only possible, of course, when you're
firing two engines by differentially pitching

736
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:30,269
the gimbals on the two engines.

737
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:36,069
This would actually be an RCS loop automatically
with one engine, but you had to have the two

738
00:53:36,069 --> 00:53:38,829
pads coupled when you were trying to do both
of them.

739
00:53:38,829 --> 00:53:41,799
But the yaw axis was separate.

740
00:53:41,799 --> 00:53:44,380
Just keeping in mind the time.

741
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:45,640
Go through one or two more charts before the
break?

742
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,299
That's fine.

743
00:53:47,299 --> 00:53:53,599
I will go through the state estimator and
then we can take a short break.

744
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:58,760
The state estimator, again, we were only getting
attitude information at 6.25 hertz from the

745
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:05,130
primary thrusters trying to maintain an estimate
of the vehicle rotation rates.

746
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:09,760
We also wanted to know what disturbances on
orbit you can have out-gassing the vehicle.

747
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,640
You have gravity gradients.

748
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,819
You have aero torques which have a diurnal
variation depending on where you are on earth

749
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:20,640
orbit relative to where the sun is which are
tending to torque the vehicle in a particular

750
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:20,890
direction.

751
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:26,940
Having knowledge of how that torque is behaving
in a certain time enables you to manipulate

752
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:30,789
your phase plane switching lines to more efficiently
use the jets.

753
00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:35,569
We were trying to estimate that.

754
00:54:35,569 --> 00:54:40,010
Given that we only had IMU data with noise
and quantization effects, we also had flexure

755
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:43,869
we weren't accounting for in doing that.

756
00:54:43,869 --> 00:54:49,210
So we had a low rate filter which incorporated
the measurements directly and a higher rate

757
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:54,230
filter which was also taking in feed forward
information we're going to fire the jets.

758
00:54:54,230 --> 00:55:01,230
We expect these velocity changes, rotational
and translational, to occur as a result of

759
00:55:01,329 --> 00:55:02,980
the jet firing.

760
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:09,079
And you can build that into the estimate to
anticipate that effect.

761
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:14,599
And then, given all that information, basically
use that in the form of a common filter.

762
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:21,599
We had different gains associated with primary
and Vernier jet usage because, given the factor

763
00:55:21,799 --> 00:55:27,150
of 30 difference in the rotational acceleration
authority of these jets, they were fundamentally

764
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:31,119
different bandwidth systems on the basis of
the actuators.

765
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,769
We accommodated those different bandwidths
in the software.

766
00:55:33,769 --> 00:55:40,769
That, by the way, affected us when we started
worrying about flexure on the arm because

767
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:46,759
we found that some of the modes with heavy
payloads in the arm actually fell within this

768
00:55:46,759 --> 00:55:47,539
bandwidth.

769
00:55:47,539 --> 00:55:51,490
And, in the case of the Vernier jets, were
falling right near the roll off point, which

770
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:54,630
was the worst possible place to have a flexure
mode.

771
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:58,079
And there were some significant design issues
that were addressed later in the program as

772
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,609
a result of that.

773
00:56:00,609 --> 00:56:02,849
And then this disturbance acceleration -- Question.

774
00:56:02,849 --> 00:56:08,380
At the time that you were designing these,
was there sufficient knowledge of the structural

775
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,950
modes or the bending modes?

776
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,180
For the RMS payload operations, not at all.

777
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:16,960
We first learned about that when we started
looking at use of the arm to deploy the SPAS

778
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,869
one payload in STS-7.

779
00:56:19,869 --> 00:56:25,180
Nobody understood at the time we were designing
for the first Shuttle flight the kind of coupling

780
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,400
effects you would get from payloads on the
arm.

781
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,619
It hadn't been modeled yet.

782
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:32,339
I would say probably about the time the first
flights were occurring is when we started

783
00:56:32,339 --> 00:56:38,000
to look at that stuff, but the Shuttle software
for the first flight was 95% frozen by '78,

784
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,319
even though the flight didn't occur until
'81.

785
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:43,329
You then discovered them in simulations or
from flight data?

786
00:56:43,329 --> 00:56:48,829
No, it was from high-fidelity simulations
with the arm dynamics included in that.

787
00:56:48,829 --> 00:56:49,990
We understood it pretty well.

788
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:55,500
We refined it after the flights.

789
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:59,400
We did even do some flight tests on STS-8
with an object called a payload flight test

790
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,490
article.

791
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:04,509
The original payload on that flight couldn't
fly in time so they put this 8,000 pound dumbbell

792
00:57:04,509 --> 00:57:06,299
on there and the arm was able to manipulate.

793
00:57:06,299 --> 00:57:10,910
Went through all kinds of exercises and pretty
much validated it with the simulations.

794
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:12,599
Were towing us at that point in time.

795
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:18,410
But it was a real lot of work that went into
those high-fidelity robotic arm simulations

796
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:21,369
and coupling that to the flight control system
to get those numbers.

797
00:57:21,369 --> 00:57:25,769
And a lot of work into evaluating what it
all meant in terms of restrictions on the

798
00:57:25,769 --> 00:57:27,470
use of the control system.

799
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:31,839
And then the last thing I will talk about
before the break, the disturbance acceleration

800
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:35,400
estimator had a 56 second time constant.

801
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:41,569
Mostly the disturbances we are talking about
were either orbital or semi-orbit, half-orbit

802
00:57:41,569 --> 00:57:44,150
type of periodicity.

803
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:47,880
You wanted to allow adequate time to integrate
and determine their effect, but not so long

804
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:53,470
that you weren't able to properly respond
to it.

805
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:57,509
Somewhere in the one-minute range seemed to
be about right for something that would have

806
00:57:57,509 --> 00:57:59,359
45 minute periodicity.

807
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:03,269
And I think the next topic will be RCS processor.

808
00:58:03,269 --> 00:58:04,970
And that is a good point to take the break.

809
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:10,849
Before we break, let me ask one historical
question.

810
00:58:10,849 --> 00:58:15,509
The timeframe for the design of this was mid
to late '70s?

811
00:58:15,509 --> 00:58:20,869
We began the work in '75.

812
00:58:20,869 --> 00:58:26,819
There was a famous phase of '76 which is the
Hay Scrub which is where we realized that

813
00:58:26,819 --> 00:58:28,279
not everything can go onto one computer.

814
00:58:28,279 --> 00:58:30,569
The computer memory had to increase.

815
00:58:30,569 --> 00:58:37,569
The real design architecture of what was going
to be the first flight started to gel in '76.

816
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:41,589
The original expected launch date of the Shuttle
was '78.

817
00:58:41,589 --> 00:58:46,660
It kind of stayed ahead of us a certain amount
of time, but we had probably 90% or 95% of

818
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,339
the design done by '78.

819
00:58:49,339 --> 00:58:53,490
We're going through detailed flight verification
and crew training with Jeff being one of the

820
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:55,009
crew members that was assigned to us.

821
00:58:55,009 --> 00:59:00,230
And we would go out to Downey to do that in
the '78 to '80 period.

822
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:07,069
In the design, now, you refer to the state
estimator and optimal control.

823
00:59:07,069 --> 00:59:13,250
By that time, had that methodology been completely
accepted as a substitute for the classical

824
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:13,789
control design?

825
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:14,730
Oh, yeah, I think so.

826
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:18,589
I think the phase plane concept first appeared,
actually, in Apollo.

827
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:23,150
And there was sort of a rudimentary application
of optimal control theory that was quite successful.

828
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:30,130
By that time I think the aircraft zoom maneuver
[NOISE OBSCURES], people were happy with that.

829
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:35,549
The Kalman filter work, an early form of that
also made it into Apollo.

830
00:59:35,549 --> 00:59:39,150
I don't think we were actually pushing the
envelope that much in using these things.

831
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,450
We actually carried over.

832
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:48,450
But Apollo, applying any of these technologies
in the mid to late `60s, was very groundbreaking.

833
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:53,359
Any other questions before the break?

834
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:53,910
OK.

835
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:56,049
Let's take five minutes.

836
00:59:56,049 --> 00:59:58,880
Am I missing anybody?

837
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,130
I know Larry hasn't come back.

838
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:04,549
Close enough.

839
01:00:04,549 --> 01:00:05,250
OK.

840
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:10,289
Well, I'm going to go into the RCS processor
now.

841
01:00:10,289 --> 01:00:12,519
We've talked a lot about the presence of the
phase plane.

842
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:16,740
We're going to go into some of the details
in the jet selection.

843
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:23,740
Important consideration of the jet selection
is we had to accommodate failures, maintaining

844
01:00:25,259 --> 01:00:32,259
control authority for any type of single failure,
thruster, manifold, string, which you will

845
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:33,569
see those later.

846
01:00:33,569 --> 01:00:40,569
And you also had to be able to maintain adequate
authority for safety with two of those combined

847
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:41,230
failures.

848
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:45,410
We also had to limit plume restrictions, accommodate
the tank constraints.

849
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:50,980
We talked about having couples, not having
couples, the balance propellant in tanks to

850
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:57,319
limit fuel usage when you didn't worry about
translational coupling and minor orbital perturbations

851
01:00:57,319 --> 01:01:00,769
and all those other special maneuvers that
we pointed out before they required higher

852
01:01:00,769 --> 01:01:02,279
authority.

853
01:01:02,279 --> 01:01:09,279
You had your manual modes going in and then
you had all these steering modes which without

854
01:01:10,069 --> 01:01:14,569
orbit, in addition to the ones we talked about,
discrete rate and pulse and acceleration and

855
01:01:14,569 --> 01:01:20,680
all that kind of stuff, you had various landmark
tracking modes, orbital object tracking modes

856
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:27,680
which were a guidance function providing inputs
to the control loop, that all had to be managed

857
01:01:28,049 --> 01:01:32,779
through a proper way of manipulating the phase
plans.

858
01:01:32,779 --> 01:01:37,609
They were tracking the errors of matter with
respect to the mode that you were in and then

859
01:01:37,609 --> 01:01:41,910
sending, based on the errors being detected
in the phase plane commands, they would be

860
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:45,130
processed by the jet selection logic.

861
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:52,130
The principles of the phase plane, we figured
you weren't important enough to get started.

862
01:01:55,279 --> 01:02:00,529
[LAUGHTER] You had a phase plane per axis.

863
01:02:00,529 --> 01:02:01,150
Roll.

864
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:01,769
Pitch.

865
01:02:01,769 --> 01:02:02,390
Yaw.

866
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:06,089
You had switch lines which were shaped based
on the expected torques.

867
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:10,519
You always had a parabolic feature, but much
more complicated than just that.

868
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:15,069
You added dead bands because you didn't want
to fire.

869
01:02:15,069 --> 01:02:19,579
When you didn't know exactly where you were,
you wanted to be able to get in the general

870
01:02:19,579 --> 01:02:23,599
vicinity far enough from a firing zone that
it would stay in the general vicinity for

871
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:27,220
a while and then only fire when you had to
when you were diverging from that.

872
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:32,950
You had to deal in the transition phase with
that rate gyro noise phenomenology.

873
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:38,130
And you had to get the disturbance acceleration
on orbit.

874
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:45,130
What we did about all those maneuver modes
is each phase plane had an origin, the origin

875
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:50,849
being zero with respect to sun frame and attitude
and position.

876
01:02:50,849 --> 01:02:57,849
You could move that origin at a rate or you
could increment its attitude position if you

877
01:02:58,019 --> 01:03:02,880
were commanding the vehicle to do something
such as a tracking maneuver or a discrete

878
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,299
rate.

879
01:03:03,299 --> 01:03:07,849
And that way the errors of the phase plane
we're looking at with respect to where you

880
01:03:07,849 --> 01:03:10,460
wanted to be rather than in absolute sense.

881
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:15,039
And you would always create [NOISE OBSCURES]
in here so that if you had a big error you

882
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:19,359
could spend a little bit of fuel to get to
somewhere which would cause you to go in the

883
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:21,779
right direction without continuously firing
the jet.

884
01:03:21,779 --> 01:03:24,990
Whereas, if you truly followed the parabolic
switch curve you would just keep firing the

885
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:29,140
jet until you were back to the origin which
can be quite costly.

886
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:34,420
So I am going to show you this picture and
then the on-orbit one.

887
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:40,079
These are the residual parabolic switch lines
which, in the optimal control theory, would

888
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,890
be going through the origin.

889
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:48,799
And then if you're out over in these region
out here you will always fire a jet meaning

890
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:51,809
a plus direction or the minus direction.

891
01:03:51,809 --> 01:03:54,190
You're inside here.

892
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:57,019
You will fire until you hit another switch
line on the other side.

893
01:03:57,019 --> 01:04:01,509
The expectation is that you're coming in this
way or you're coming in this way.

894
01:04:01,509 --> 01:04:05,809
You want to get to a point where you're not
likely to fire again for a while.

895
01:04:05,809 --> 01:04:12,809
But then you also would be concerned because
you don't automatically want to fire back

896
01:04:18,049 --> 01:04:23,990
right away because the rate gyro noise phenomenology
could cause, where you think you are with

897
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:29,730
respect to that line, to move back and forth
causing you to fire too soon, causing the

898
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:31,960
fire again to reverse that and get in trouble.

899
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:38,960
So what we actually did is if you actually
hit this line and began to fire, each time

900
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:49,490
you fired up to two or three times it would
move the line out temporarily so that the

901
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:55,140
quantum noise from that MDM would not make
you think, even though you were moving this

902
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:57,230
way, that you were going back out.

903
01:04:57,230 --> 01:05:03,099
Because, if you fired that jet again, not
only would you be spinning the propellant

904
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:05,690
to go faster, you'd hit the other line a lot
faster still.

905
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:11,809
For every time you double the size of the
impulse that you use to reverse your rate,

906
01:05:11,809 --> 01:05:13,859
you're quadrupling the total propellant time.

907
01:05:13,859 --> 01:05:20,859
Because, if you double the propellant each
time, you hit a surface twice as fast before

908
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:26,619
you get to the next one.

909
01:05:26,619 --> 01:05:32,259
Now, on-orbit we didn't have that noise problem
so we don't have that moving switch line there.

910
01:05:32,259 --> 01:05:33,579
But we have this moving switch line.

911
01:05:33,579 --> 01:05:37,430
If you're coming in you're looking to hit
the zero line and cut off, but here you're

912
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:40,039
not going to cut off until you hit the disturbance
acceleration line.

913
01:05:40,039 --> 01:05:44,259
It is expecting, when you hit that, that the
predicted acceleration is going to say you're

914
01:05:44,259 --> 01:05:45,130
going to go up this way.

915
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:50,490
That means it will be longer before you hit
another surface than if you start doing that

916
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:51,450
over here.

917
01:05:51,450 --> 01:05:58,450
So this one is a trick to lower the frequency
of the jet firings based on other knowledge

918
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:04,859
that we had about the acceleration.

919
01:06:04,859 --> 01:06:05,470
Jet selection.

920
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:08,200
We had entirely different laws for the primary
and the Vernier.

921
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:15,200
The Verniers had a very complicated configuration,
had to be able to be fault tolerant, be able

922
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:19,619
to handle simultaneous translation rotation
commands.

923
01:06:19,619 --> 01:06:26,619
It turned out, because of throughput processing
limits, the correct approach was something

924
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:28,109
like a table lookup.

925
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:32,539
But we had all kinds of rules we went through
to say which kind of table did we want to

926
01:06:32,539 --> 01:06:33,259
go to?

927
01:06:33,259 --> 01:06:34,960
What are the consequences of failures?

928
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,910
Do we want to start modifying the commands
we've received because of what we basically

929
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:46,910
know about which jets have failed and what
we no longer can accomplish?

930
01:06:48,529 --> 01:06:52,059
We actually had a Bullion implementation of
those tables that actually got implemented

931
01:06:52,059 --> 01:06:56,499
as tables because we developed algorithms
and IBM converted the software.

932
01:06:56,499 --> 01:07:00,279
And they didn't necessarily do exactly what
we told them.

933
01:07:00,279 --> 01:07:06,900
Subsequent to that there was an experiment
on the Shuttle called a phase space autopilot

934
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:13,900
which is based on looking for velocity changes
and optimal combinations of jets.

935
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:21,930
You would go through a linear optimal search
and find the combinations.

936
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:27,029
That was flown a couple times for a few hours
on Shuttle.

937
01:07:27,029 --> 01:07:33,730
The experiment was quite successful but never
converted into a basic shuttle capability.

938
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:37,130
But certainly with the processing capability
that you have now would be a very good option

939
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:38,319
as an alternative to what we did.

940
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:43,309
The Vernier jets, which were only used on
orbit, only had six jets.

941
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:47,150
We weren't trying to deal with redundancies
so an entirely different kind of scheme was

942
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:49,740
done there.

943
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:56,740
We were looking to find the jets with respect
to a three-axis command which best contributed

944
01:07:58,809 --> 01:08:01,079
to producing rates in that direction.

945
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:04,910
We could find a first jet that would be the
best jet.

946
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:11,200
And then we could see, given how good that
one is, is there another one which is half

947
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:11,690
as good?

948
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:13,180
If so, we would pick it.

949
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:17,060
And, if we found one half as good, we might
say if there is another one which is half

950
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:21,810
again as good we might pick that and end up
with an aggregate number of jets we would

951
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:28,380
turn on to start producing the command.

952
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:33,420
This would be based not just on whether or
not the phase plane said you should have a

953
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:40,420
jet fire in an axis, but also on how big the
error was but not yet to the point of hitting

954
01:08:40,609 --> 01:08:44,460
the phase plane line in the other axis.

955
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:50,259
And so the composite vector you were trying
to neutralize would be a combination of the

956
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:52,380
command and error reduction on the other axes.

957
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:56,770
And you would find the jets which would then
respond your command and reduce the errors

958
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:57,810
on the other axes.

959
01:08:57,810 --> 01:08:59,960
Now, we would not re-compute that every cycle.

960
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:06,960
If we found that the ones or minus ones in
the three axes for the commands were not changing,

961
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:13,029
even though the fractional values and the
uncommand of axes were changing for up to

962
01:09:13,029 --> 01:09:15,469
five cycles we would not re-compute the jets.

963
01:09:15,469 --> 01:09:22,069
And that would minimize the duty cycles which
was a life issue on the jets.

964
01:09:22,069 --> 01:09:27,900
And then there was the other phenomenology
I mentioned which is you start having large

965
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:31,690
payloads or you're attached to Mir or something
like that.

966
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:33,589
Mass properties are very different.

967
01:09:33,589 --> 01:09:37,529
We don't know about that unless the crew tells
us, but we could put a discrete number of

968
01:09:37,529 --> 01:09:41,819
alternative configurations in the tables for
what we expected accelerations of the jets

969
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:42,900
would be.

970
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,940
The crew could tell us which one applies,
and then it would do this selection based

971
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:48,529
on that.

972
01:09:48,529 --> 01:09:50,609
The Vernier algorithm looks something like
this flow chart.

973
01:09:50,609 --> 01:09:54,800
Whereas, the primary algorithm would probably
fill a 50 page flowchart.

974
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,389
The Vernier algorithm was very simple.

975
01:09:57,389 --> 01:10:03,880
You go through and have a command vector which
was ones and minus ones or fractional values,

976
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:09,330
depending on whether or not phase planes have
commanded an axis or just had a bias because

977
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,270
of an error in that axis.

978
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:15,150
You would do a dot product of the six jets.

979
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:22,150
You would look for the maximum value of that
dot product of the acceleration and the command.

980
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:25,670
And then, based on that value of that dot
product, you would see if there was one that

981
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:26,400
was half as good.

982
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,560
And, if there was one as half as good, you
would see if there was one that was a quarter

983
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,190
as good.

984
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:36,170
And then, if we already selected, we would
be doing this counter of up to five times

985
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:38,100
where we wouldn't recomputed.

986
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:42,639
Now, I was just talking during the break about
one of the constraints on here.

987
01:10:42,639 --> 01:10:45,900
When we were using these computers, the dot
product of a three vector by three vector

988
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:49,239
took about one millisecond.

989
01:10:49,239 --> 01:10:50,570
We had an 80 millisecond cycle.

990
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:57,150
And, in that 80 millisecond cycle, seven to
ten milliseconds could be allocated to control

991
01:10:57,150 --> 01:11:01,010
some of the guidance and some of the other
functions.

992
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:02,159
Six milliseconds was being used to do these
dot products.

993
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:09,159
That is why we never could have considered
doing something like that for the primary

994
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:12,530
jets.

995
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:19,530
The TVC processor, we have instead of discrete
control with thrusters, we have nearly continuous

996
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:28,460
control because we're doing gimbal steering
up to the nonlinear effect of a gimbal limit.

997
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:30,210
Remind them what TVC is.

998
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:31,770
Thrust vector control.

999
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:36,730
Moving the thrust of the OMS engine by steering
the gimbals on which it is attached, which

1000
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:43,590
you cannot do with the RCS thrusters.

1001
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,510
What we would do then is cross-product steering.

1002
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:49,949
You have an error vector and a thrust vector,
and the cross-product between the two could

1003
01:11:49,949 --> 01:11:55,110
tell you the direction you needed to steer
the vehicle to turn into the desired direction

1004
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,949
you wanted to thrust.

1005
01:11:56,949 --> 01:12:02,290
That steering command was then used to determine
the commands we sent to the gimbals for moving

1006
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:03,800
the engines.

1007
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:08,679
You had manual and automatic modes for doing
that.

1008
01:12:08,679 --> 01:12:14,080
Generally, we were limited to two degrees
per second because the gimbals were fairly

1009
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:14,659
slow.

1010
01:12:14,659 --> 01:12:19,940
We didn't want to get ourselves in a situation
where we over-steered and had to correct back

1011
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:22,710
which would take a lot of time and maybe cost
us some propellant.

1012
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:26,330
But, if we got into trouble, the reaction
control system could wrap around.

1013
01:12:26,330 --> 01:12:30,050
And that could happen automatically if the
errors got big enough or the crew could induce

1014
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:33,150
that by hitting the hand controller.

1015
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:38,110
And you have the two pads going into the manual
auto mode.

1016
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:43,310
And manual always overrides auto from any
of these operations.

1017
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:49,449
We had a lot of things we had to tolerate
in determining our filter gains.

1018
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:53,570
We didn't always know the thrust direction
engines all that way because of mechanical

1019
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:54,090
misalignment.

1020
01:12:54,090 --> 01:13:00,150
When you build this thing an additional misalignment
occurs after you launch the thing causing

1021
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:06,989
changes in the gimbal drive connections a
little bit.

1022
01:13:06,989 --> 01:13:12,020
There are errors.

1023
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:15,920
You rotate to a desired burn direction with
the RCS jets before you light the engines.

1024
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,600
You're never exactly there when you start
up.

1025
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,199
You can have failures during burns.

1026
01:13:20,199 --> 01:13:22,409
An engine can shut down.

1027
01:13:22,409 --> 01:13:28,380
An actuator can stop driving.

1028
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:35,380
If it is the OMS-1 burn in the early Shuttle
days, during that burn they were dumping the

1029
01:13:36,139 --> 01:13:41,199
residual oxygen and hydrogen in the feed lines
for the main engines during the burn causing

1030
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:44,969
torque disturbance on the vehicle that we
had to overcome.

1031
01:13:44,969 --> 01:13:49,280
The OMS burn actually helped drive that fluid
out of those lines.

1032
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:52,420
And then, of course, we had steering noise
and bias.

1033
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:57,550
And then we had to have margins for things
that all liquid propellant vehicles have.

1034
01:13:57,550 --> 01:14:04,550
Slosh, flexure, actuator nonlinearities and
sample rate effects.

1035
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:11,260
Now we had a design and then we had to change
it.

1036
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:14,840
And the reason we had to change it is we flew
for a little while, and we discovered that

1037
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:20,570
these brushless electric motors being used
for the OMS actuators were turning on and

1038
01:14:20,570 --> 01:14:24,570
off at a high enough rate during the burns
that they were overheating making a hundred

1039
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:27,460
mission life maybe two or three missions.

1040
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:33,150
And they could take the pods off, but they
were fairly hard to get and expensive to maintain.

1041
01:14:33,150 --> 01:14:37,760
So they asked us to change the bandwidth.

1042
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:43,290
And that's what we did beginning with the
twelfth shuttle flight making these changes

1043
01:14:43,290 --> 01:14:44,110
here.

1044
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:50,960
And that caused a little bit more sloppy behavior
at the beginning and the end of the burn but

1045
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,090
didn't make very appreciable difference on
the performance and made a big difference

1046
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:57,719
on the actuator life.

1047
01:14:57,719 --> 01:15:02,010
There was an outer loop just showing where
the cross-product steering comes in and the

1048
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:07,409
fact that there are various filters and digital
compensation effects that are going into this

1049
01:15:07,409 --> 01:15:13,639
to deal in an adequate manner with all those
effects that I listed a few minutes ago.

1050
01:15:13,639 --> 01:15:20,639
The wraparound was there because we have the
means to cover for large perturbations.

1051
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:23,739
Why not implement it?

1052
01:15:23,739 --> 01:15:27,719
I mean the situation you always have with
human space flight, if there was a capability

1053
01:15:27,719 --> 01:15:34,719
you can take advantage of in a contingency
scenario put it in.

1054
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:41,800
This also changed, though, between the first
flight and the twelfth flight.

1055
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:46,380
And the reason we found is that you put this
contingency capability in, but when you really

1056
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:50,860
study it you realize you can actually take
these two fundamentally different control

1057
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:55,590
laws and cause them to interact adversely.

1058
01:15:55,590 --> 01:16:01,150
We could perturb it and then induce the jets
to fire in a way that would cause it to counteract

1059
01:16:01,150 --> 01:16:04,210
the effect that the thrust vector control
system was doing.

1060
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:09,800
So, when we lowered the bandwidth, we also
changed some of the parameters in there to,

1061
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,969
in combination, preclude that first flight.

1062
01:16:12,969 --> 01:16:18,969
This is a case where we continued to evaluate
the baseline system after we were flying and

1063
01:16:18,969 --> 01:16:25,969
discovered additional potential unanticipated
deficiencies that we should fix, which is

1064
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:31,810
saying you're never done analyzing the system
even after it starts flying.

1065
01:16:31,810 --> 01:16:38,449
The maneuver and track modes, I mentioned
that they were there, but we had this universal

1066
01:16:38,449 --> 01:16:41,170
pointing display that the crew could manipulate.

1067
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:41,780
Yes?

1068
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:48,780
On that last general comment, on the last
subject of discovering issues and potential

1069
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:51,210
problems after the system is flying.

1070
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:52,290
You're doing the analysis.

1071
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:54,920
You're doing your research.

1072
01:16:54,920 --> 01:17:01,130
What, in general, were the reactions of your
NASA counterparts when you bring that to their

1073
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:01,380
attention?

1074
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:04,369
Would they call for an immediate fix before
the next launch?

1075
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:05,840
It depended on the nature of the problem.

1076
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:09,780
And let me mention two or three of them at
one time.

1077
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:15,070
I mentioned one about that phenomenology for
the excitation or the rocking motion on the

1078
01:17:15,070 --> 01:17:15,460
tank.

1079
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:19,469
And then another one with the Vernier jets
which I will explain in a moment.

1080
01:17:19,469 --> 01:17:23,630
The external tank one had to be fixed before
a second shuttle flight.

1081
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:26,440
There was one that potentially created a dangerous
situation.

1082
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:30,820
Tank separation violated safety of flight
rules.

1083
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:34,820
This one was a potential wraparound interaction.

1084
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:40,600
It could only occur if you already had a significant
contingency under fairly complex conditions.

1085
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:47,310
And, if the crew knew about it, there was
a procedural way to temporarily inhibit the

1086
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:51,040
reaction control system interactions stopping
the effect.

1087
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:54,840
Because there was a crew workaround, they
knew about the problem, it was deemed acceptable

1088
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:59,530
to go some number of missions for an already
scheduled software update to insert it.

1089
01:17:59,530 --> 01:18:06,530
Now, the third problem discovered as a result
of analysis of STS-1 and 3 was a plume and

1090
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:12,320
pendulum phenomenology of the down firing
aft jets.

1091
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:19,320
The body flap sticks out as kind of a random
position on orbit, and the down firing thrusters,

1092
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:22,010
part of their plume hits it.

1093
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:27,590
They had evaluated that effect for the primary
jets because they knew in the direction they

1094
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:31,550
pointed and their lower expansion ratio in
the Vernier jets there was going to be a problem.

1095
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:34,150
And that was properly dealt with in the flight
control system.

1096
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:39,790
They never modeled for the Vernier jets, but
only discovered that the state estimator was

1097
01:18:39,790 --> 01:18:46,489
not converging as well as expected on the
first Shuttle flight when using the Vernier

1098
01:18:46,489 --> 01:18:46,739
jets.

1099
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:52,139
And it turned out there was probably a 20%
or 30% net reduction in thrust and a 15 or

1100
01:18:52,139 --> 01:18:57,530
20 degree effective change in the direction
of the thrusts, those two down firing Verniers.

1101
01:18:57,530 --> 01:19:02,610
And the feed forward estimation from the RCS
jets, as a result, was giving the wrong data

1102
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:07,920
in the state estimator causing a jump in the
value and a long time constant to settle out.

1103
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:13,690
And that was causing a few percent increase
in the propellant consumption but probably

1104
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:17,369
a factor of ten increase in the duty cycles
of the jets which was unacceptable from the

1105
01:19:17,369 --> 01:19:19,230
life of the jets.

1106
01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:24,190
That was compounded by a problem in STS-3
which is the first time they used the arm.

1107
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:28,650
And they actually put a few hundred pound
payload and tried controlling the attitude

1108
01:19:28,650 --> 01:19:30,460
of the vehicle in moving that payload.

1109
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:36,280
The combination of those things they went
back and, by STS-5, had to make serious changes

1110
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:43,280
to the phase plane estimation logic and tables
for the accelerations for those Vernier jets

1111
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,239
because they didn't want to burn those jets.

1112
01:19:47,239 --> 01:19:50,070
I think, after STS-2, they actually changed
some of the jets.

1113
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:55,360
And then they didn't want to have to change
them again.

1114
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:59,550
The maneuver mode.

1115
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:05,510
You want to do various types of [NOISE OBSCURES]
maneuvers with respect to various frames of

1116
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:12,510
reference which could be landmark tracking,
local vertical tracking, second spacecraft

1117
01:20:12,969 --> 01:20:14,869
if you're doing a rendezvous tracking.

1118
01:20:14,869 --> 01:20:16,260
Guidance to provide that.

1119
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:22,239
That would be broken down into components
by axis.

1120
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:26,760
And then there was an additional level of
hysteresis about what you were telling the

1121
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:27,489
face plane to do.

1122
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:30,610
And I talked about adjusting the origin.

1123
01:20:30,610 --> 01:20:34,320
This would decide whether or not you would
adjust the origin.

1124
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:39,210
If you're error in a given axis with respect
to what you wanted to do with the maneuver

1125
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:42,639
was less than twice the dead band, you would
not adjust the origin.

1126
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:46,219
And if it was more than twice you would.

1127
01:20:46,219 --> 01:20:51,360
And, again, it is a case of why force it to
do things it doesn't have to do if it's going

1128
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:54,969
to get there eventually anyway?

1129
01:20:54,969 --> 01:21:01,969
And that is actually an adjustable parameter
which, for certain payload missions, they

1130
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:09,790
might change that value from something else.

1131
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:17,630
There were these various direct manual translation
rotation modes and the auto modes that I think

1132
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:22,489
bit by bit I have talked about.

1133
01:21:22,489 --> 01:21:28,860
The reason you have these different references,
inertial and local vertical, if you're doing

1134
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:32,619
an earth observation mission, almost everything
is going to be in a local vertical frame.

1135
01:21:32,619 --> 01:21:35,690
You're going to have your payload bay pointing
down.

1136
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:38,119
You want to keep it pointed at a certain spot.

1137
01:21:38,119 --> 01:21:43,790
If you're doing a solar telescope mission,
everything is going to be in an inertial frame.

1138
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:49,210
You're going to want to keep it pointing at
the sun or within a few degrees where maybe

1139
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:56,210
the telescope will have a limited travel of
its own.

1140
01:21:57,010 --> 01:22:01,050
If you're doing rendezvous then it's going
to have to be you're accounting for the orb

1141
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:02,389
rates of the two vehicles.

1142
01:22:02,389 --> 01:22:07,849
You're going to want to keep your rendezvous
radar pointed in the right direction.

1143
01:22:07,849 --> 01:22:14,849
By the way, the rendezvous radar, there is
a deployable dish antenna that goes out of

1144
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,290
the payload bay, the side of the payload bay
of the Shuttle.

1145
01:22:17,290 --> 01:22:20,520
That is a dual-purpose antenna.

1146
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:27,520
It can be used to point at the TDRS satellite
to send data at high rates to the earth and

1147
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:28,650
track the satellite.

1148
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:34,989
Or it can be used to point a radar beam at
another spacecraft.

1149
01:22:34,989 --> 01:22:38,790
It was not used for TDRS in the beginning
of the program.

1150
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:45,790
It was only used for radar because the first
TDRS was launched by STS-6.

1151
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:49,670
Electronic string, and I think we're about
at the right point of time on this, too, to

1152
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:55,150
allowing me to get into this in a little bit
of detail.

1153
01:22:55,150 --> 01:22:59,270
This was something that kind of crept up on
us in importance.

1154
01:22:59,270 --> 01:23:06,270
It was thought it would make the systems redundant,
have separate strings, don't put them all

1155
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:08,010
on the same computer.

1156
01:23:08,010 --> 01:23:12,000
All those things were recognized, but I don't
think until about a year, a year and half

1157
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,020
before the first flight actually occurred
that we realized how difficult it is to be

1158
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:22,900
sure that all the interactions of these strings,
the power string, the pluming string and the

1159
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:29,020
electronic string and the possible combinations
of failures, how difficult it is to assure

1160
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:32,050
that you meet those high level failure tolerance
requirements.

1161
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:39,050
And that is what I think I did in 1980, '81,
probably was the early form of fault tree

1162
01:23:39,630 --> 01:23:39,940
analysis.

1163
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:45,699
And I have in a handbook I developed for the
first flight, a series what if tables with

1164
01:23:45,699 --> 01:23:49,880
all these different breakdowns of what could
happen.

1165
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:53,290
And actually a person that didn't know about
probabilities and all looked at it.

1166
01:23:53,290 --> 01:23:58,920
It was a pretty scary table when you looked
at all the possible bizarre two failure combinations.

1167
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:03,639
But first you've got to understand what the
strings are.

1168
01:24:03,639 --> 01:24:10,639
You would have one forward, one aft left,
one aft right, so three boxes, three half

1169
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:21,739
boxes and multiplexers-demultiplexers on a
string.

1170
01:24:21,739 --> 01:24:28,739
And there were two MDM boxes in each pod,
forward left right aft.

1171
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:35,710
And the electronics were broken apart into
each half box.

1172
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:40,940
So you actually had, in effect, four sets
of electronics in each pod, even though you

1173
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:45,800
only had two boxes.

1174
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:50,630
And one card from each of those boxes would
be dedicated to string, but each string would

1175
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:53,570
have a card per pod.

1176
01:24:53,570 --> 01:25:00,070
So three cards would be tied electronically
to one computer anomaly.

1177
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:07,070
Now, you couldn't take a string that could
be commanded by more than one computer.

1178
01:25:09,739 --> 01:25:13,869
The computer saw the data from all four strings
so they could vote the data to decide whether

1179
01:25:13,869 --> 01:25:18,860
or not each of the computers was healthy,
but they could only command one string.

1180
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:25,860
I should say each string could only be commanded
by one computer, but you could, if you started

1181
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,630
losing computers, latch up more than one string
to one computer.

1182
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:34,000
Even though one string could only take commands
from one computer, more than one string could

1183
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,780
take commands from the same computer if that
became necessary.

1184
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:42,290
If you lost a computer and were in a benign
environment and you wanted to recover all

1185
01:25:42,290 --> 01:25:47,199
those systems, that happened with the first
computer failure in STS-9, then you would

1186
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:51,860
manually re-latch those strings to a healthy
computer.

1187
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:58,860
Of course, if that computer went down then
it would take two strings down.

1188
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:10,190
There was a unique latch up of these string
components to power systems, but it wasn't

1189
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:11,659
necessarily one-to-one.

1190
01:26:11,659 --> 01:26:18,239
And that is where things got very complicated,
when you start crossing the subsystems where

1191
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:21,980
one power system could cause some subsystems
to fail on more than one string.

1192
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:23,790
Then you take a string down.

1193
01:26:23,790 --> 01:26:29,340
That would be a very different failure scenario
than taking two strings down.

1194
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:32,440
This is showing how the thrusters laid out.

1195
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:37,070
You can see there are a lot of thrusters on
each string.

1196
01:26:37,070 --> 01:26:43,250
If you go back and look at the vehicle carefully
and you look at the down firing thrusters,

1197
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:49,170
you will see that in the front of the tank
there are two thrusters that point down to

1198
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:55,800
the left and two thrusters that point down
to the right candid out about 40 degrees.

1199
01:26:55,800 --> 01:27:01,260
That means that if you lose two thrusters,
two strings or two manifolds it was possible

1200
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:03,040
to lose both of them on one side.

1201
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:08,960
That is very important because that's one
of the phenomena we had to protect against

1202
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,250
for separating from the external tank.

1203
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:14,449
And it becomes a highly coupled separation
maneuver.

1204
01:27:14,449 --> 01:27:21,130
And there were some special jet select tables
created for that and some special control

1205
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:23,280
logic loops that were created just for that
one scenario.

1206
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:30,280
You go through these things and certain critical
events where things cannot fail even if your

1207
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:34,389
subsystems have failed twice.

1208
01:27:34,389 --> 01:27:38,560
And the subsystems may not have been designed
to make it very convenient, but you still

1209
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:38,820
have to do it.

1210
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:41,940
That happens to be one of the scenarios we
looked at a lot.

1211
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:47,090
And that we see forward down left down left
or forward down right down right.

1212
01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:50,650
So somehow you lose the thrusters, these strings
or whatever.

1213
01:27:50,650 --> 01:27:53,449
That became a special design case.

1214
01:27:53,449 --> 01:27:56,080
And there were a lot of those kinds of things.

1215
01:27:56,080 --> 01:28:03,080
I would say 70% or 80% of our design time
goes into learning those special cases.

1216
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:11,790
With the thrusters the manifolds are basically
the valve lines, so there is a commonality

1217
01:28:15,889 --> 01:28:20,099
between the electronic stringing of manifolds
in those valves.

1218
01:28:20,099 --> 01:28:22,210
With the OMS that's not really true.

1219
01:28:22,210 --> 01:28:27,800
The way the OMS engines work, each engine
[NOISE OBSCURES] is actually an oxidizer and

1220
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:34,800
fuel tank going into two loops of lines each
with two valves.

1221
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:42,480
At least one valve in each path had to open
to feed fuel.

1222
01:28:44,010 --> 01:28:51,010
At least both valves in one loop had to close
to stop fuel from flowing.

1223
01:28:55,260 --> 01:29:02,260
Any combination which would leave two open
after a burn started or would leave two closed

1224
01:29:04,659 --> 01:29:08,780
before the burn started was a problem.

1225
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:10,000
Then you have pressure sensors.

1226
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,880
And there was only one per engine.

1227
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:19,219
You lacked insight into whether or not the
engine started based on pressure if one of

1228
01:29:19,219 --> 01:29:21,179
those failed.

1229
01:29:21,179 --> 01:29:26,270
The stringing of this was not the same as
the electronic string, so we had to start

1230
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:33,270
looking at the possibility of individual valve
failures and electronic string failures.

1231
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:35,070
Taking down other valves.

1232
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:38,719
Did that happen before an engine started,
after an engine started?

1233
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:44,349
How did that correlate with then influence
on the same engine's actuator control?

1234
01:29:44,349 --> 01:29:49,530
We could get situations where we could start
the engine but we couldn't steer it, engines

1235
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:56,530
that we could steer but couldn't start it,
and so we ended up with this maze of tables

1236
01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:02,179
looking at those situations coming up with
contingency designs.

1237
01:30:02,179 --> 01:30:08,330
Sometimes reverting to using the XRCS jets
under severe multiple failure scenarios that

1238
01:30:08,330 --> 01:30:15,040
actually do deorbit burns.

1239
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,679
We talked about what could go down.

1240
01:30:16,679 --> 01:30:22,630
All of these things could be lost with a single
failure, though not all strings have an IMU

1241
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:24,190
because there are only three.

1242
01:30:24,190 --> 01:30:27,770
And only two of the chamber pressure.

1243
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:32,580
Some strings were more important than others
with respect to a subset of the systems.

1244
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:39,580
And since there are only two thrusters on
one manifold per pod of the Verniers, there

1245
01:30:39,610 --> 01:30:42,679
are also only three strings that affected
those.

1246
01:30:42,679 --> 01:30:49,679
All this got set up so that any one failure
was quite manageable, but the moment you talked

1247
01:30:51,290 --> 01:30:57,770
about any possible two failures was when it
became much more complicated.

1248
01:30:57,770 --> 01:31:04,770
Generally, where we ended up, after lots and
lots of special design accommodation was we

1249
01:31:06,869 --> 01:31:13,869
tolerated loss of translation control in the
axes that were not necessary for managing

1250
01:31:17,489 --> 01:31:20,570
deorbit.

1251
01:31:20,570 --> 01:31:27,010
We tolerated degradation and rotation control
but assured that we retained it, at least

1252
01:31:27,010 --> 01:31:30,170
in a time average sense, in all three axes.

1253
01:31:30,170 --> 01:31:37,170
The biggest complexity here was assuring we
still had adequate time averaged translation

1254
01:31:37,429 --> 01:31:39,960
and rotation control for tank separation.

1255
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:43,270
So we would pull away without recontacting
the tank.

1256
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:47,010
Remember, recontacting the tank meant tiles
hitting the tank.

1257
01:31:47,010 --> 01:31:50,199
Those tiles are really fragile.

1258
01:31:50,199 --> 01:31:57,199
They can survive thousands of degrees but
not much impact.

1259
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:04,760
We accommodated the scenario where we could
lose all thrust vector control on the OMS

1260
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:11,760
engines and still do a deorbit burn usually
with RCS wraparound properly designed.

1261
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:17,349
And we had to accommodate the situations where
MDMs did not reset, so everything tied to

1262
01:32:17,349 --> 01:32:19,420
an MDM would be lost.

1263
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:24,239
And that is the kind of situation where you
start having valve here, a valve here, a valve

1264
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:28,219
there being shut down along with a bunch of
jets.

1265
01:32:28,219 --> 01:32:35,219
And the real pain was understanding what things
could collectively go down together.

1266
01:32:36,139 --> 01:32:42,619
You had to lay out all the faults, all the
things that could happen with each of the

1267
01:32:42,619 --> 01:32:45,849
faults and then overlaying the combinations
of those.

1268
01:32:45,849 --> 01:32:48,340
And then you would find it wasn't everything
you were worried about.

1269
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:54,230
It was usually a small fraction, but those
few fractions drove the design details and

1270
01:32:54,230 --> 01:32:56,869
effort to a great degree.

1271
01:32:56,869 --> 01:33:02,909
Now, on orbit, because you would often being
using one IMU and you only had two computers,

1272
01:33:02,909 --> 01:33:05,469
one of those strings going down meant you
lost your navigation base.

1273
01:33:05,469 --> 01:33:09,960
But because you're in a relatively benign
environment, restringing and bringing up another

1274
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:11,000
system wasn't a problem.

1275
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:15,040
If you were doing terminal rendezvous with
the Space Station, you would not be in a one

1276
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:15,330
IMU mode.

1277
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:22,330
You would be in a three IMU mode on two computers,
but you would not lose your navigation base.

1278
01:33:23,409 --> 01:33:29,010
If you lost a computer at a critical point
in that, you would probably abort the rendezvous,

1279
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:33,139
reconfigure again and resume your operations.

1280
01:33:33,139 --> 01:33:37,880
One of the ground rules for all rendezvous
operations with the Shuttle, and I think will

1281
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:42,219
be true of the CVE is an rendezvous operation
planned to do has to be able to be repeated

1282
01:33:42,219 --> 01:33:42,489
at least once.

1283
01:33:42,489 --> 01:33:49,489
The way I want to end this, and then we could
have questions, is two pictures, before and

1284
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:58,760
after cockpit upgrade on the Shuttle.

1285
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:03,110
This was the way the Shuttle was for many
flights.

1286
01:34:03,110 --> 01:34:10,110
Those are CRT displays, green monochrome where
no images could be drawn except little sticks,

1287
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:20,270
dots and lines and rudimentary.

1288
01:34:20,270 --> 01:34:26,659
These are analog tape measures, analog eight
ball with analog needles for attitude and

1289
01:34:26,659 --> 01:34:30,889
rate information.

1290
01:34:30,889 --> 01:34:35,429
And really very 1970s.

1291
01:34:35,429 --> 01:34:39,380
Comment on that.

1292
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:46,110
One of the things that we did as payload specialists
is we got some training in the cockpit, and

1293
01:34:46,110 --> 01:34:49,179
that was the version that was available in
the early `90s when I was down there.

1294
01:34:49,179 --> 01:34:54,420
And you would go from your desk at the Johnson
Space Center when you were using an IMB Think

1295
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:59,800
Pad or something, and you felt as though you
had gone through a time warp when you went

1296
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:03,469
back to the simulator on what was the world's
most expensive vehicle.

1297
01:35:03,469 --> 01:35:04,989
It was extraordinary.

1298
01:35:04,989 --> 01:35:09,369
And, of course, you could explain why this
was kept on so long.

1299
01:35:09,369 --> 01:35:16,369
Well, it was this multi seven digit figure
for its upgrade, as well as the issue about

1300
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:18,349
recertification.

1301
01:35:18,349 --> 01:35:25,349
And let me mention both of those in a moment,
point out a couple of things and get back

1302
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:30,449
to that before I show you the current configuration.

1303
01:35:30,449 --> 01:35:37,449
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] The amount in the Shuttle
versus the amount to support the Shuttle?

1304
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:42,590
In the Shuttle because [NOISE OBSCURES].

1305
01:35:42,590 --> 01:35:45,639
Well, you only have a 104k memory computer.

1306
01:35:45,639 --> 01:35:51,730
You have the actual number of lines that are
[NOISE OBSCURES].

1307
01:35:51,730 --> 01:35:58,730
Yeah, you had the 104k for the backup system,
the 104k for ascent and entry, the 104k for

1308
01:35:59,369 --> 01:36:05,650
on-orbit, the 104k for system management.

1309
01:36:05,650 --> 01:36:08,849
And then there have been other things where
their own software capabilities have been

1310
01:36:08,849 --> 01:36:10,000
added in subsequent years.

1311
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:17,000
So it is a lot of software now, but human
validation means if you make small change

1312
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:22,679
everything has to be reassessed for possible
interaction to a degree that you would never

1313
01:36:22,679 --> 01:36:28,630
do for a mission that doesn't put human safety
at risk.

1314
01:36:28,630 --> 01:36:35,510
That means the cost of doing that each time
is probably an order of magnitude higher than

1315
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:38,170
it would be for an unmanned system.

1316
01:36:38,170 --> 01:36:43,429
You look at what it was going to take to put
a cockpit upgrade in there.

1317
01:36:43,429 --> 01:36:47,070
We're talking hundreds of millions of dollars
to do it for the fleet.

1318
01:36:47,070 --> 01:36:47,820
And when I say hundreds of millions, a couple
hundred million.

1319
01:36:47,820 --> 01:36:52,869
It did eventually get done, as I will show
you in the next picture, but the main reason

1320
01:36:52,869 --> 01:36:59,659
was obsolescence rather than wanting to be
contemporary.

1321
01:36:59,659 --> 01:37:03,659
You cannot buy these pieces to replace them
anymore.

1322
01:37:03,659 --> 01:37:08,579
The companies that actually made some of these
systems may not exist.

1323
01:37:08,579 --> 01:37:13,380
Or, if they do, they have no economic incentive
for maintaining the base for a customer that

1324
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:15,550
may buy another five of them.

1325
01:37:15,550 --> 01:37:21,320
And so, one of the things you have to deal
with when a system is going to do this many

1326
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:27,110
years, another example of that is the B-52
or the Triton missiles or things that stay

1327
01:37:27,110 --> 01:37:33,489
in operation for a long time, is you have
to plan, as part of your operation cost, for

1328
01:37:33,489 --> 01:37:40,050
periodic upgrades to mitigate obsolescence.

1329
01:37:40,050 --> 01:37:47,050
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] In some program they had
some support.

1330
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:58,500
It was Digital microcomputers.

1331
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:02,099
We had a room over in the Hill building that
had about 100 of them stacked up as backups.

1332
01:38:02,099 --> 01:38:06,320
I don't think the boxes ever got opened.

1333
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:12,250
I think the program did the buy, but the program
never lasted as long as it was supposed to.

1334
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:14,130
But you are right.

1335
01:38:14,130 --> 01:38:15,139
You can try to buy it.

1336
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:20,480
But, even so, even unused systems had a shelf
life.

1337
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:24,420
And you don't know how good they are going
to be 30 years later.

1338
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:28,800
If you had asked me in 1978 how long the Shuttle
was going to fly before it was replaced, I

1339
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,079
would have said ten years, maybe 15.

1340
01:38:31,079 --> 01:38:34,440
Before the Columbia accident they were talking
about another 20.

1341
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:38,969
It is only the safety issues now that are
going to make them stop it soon.

1342
01:38:38,969 --> 01:38:45,860
Anyway, the other thing I want to point out
here, this is the crew interaction mechanism,

1343
01:38:45,860 --> 01:38:49,679
a push button display.

1344
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:50,750
No such thing as GUI.

1345
01:38:50,750 --> 01:38:54,409
That is unheard of in the Shuttle.

1346
01:38:54,409 --> 01:38:57,969
Can you talk a bit about the hand controllers?

1347
01:38:57,969 --> 01:38:58,389
Are they the same ones used for landings that
are also used for docking?

1348
01:38:58,389 --> 01:39:02,449
I mean was it the same hand controller for
everything?

1349
01:39:02,449 --> 01:39:06,260
It is the same hand controller for everything,
except there is another station in the back,

1350
01:39:06,260 --> 01:39:09,540
I didn't bring a picture of it, which is used
for docking.

1351
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:14,570
The cockpit, you're looking out the forward
windows, you turn around and there is another

1352
01:39:14,570 --> 01:39:17,780
set of cockpit instrumentation, hand controllers.

1353
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:21,860
And there are two windows above you and two
windows looking on the payload bay.

1354
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:26,199
And there are also controllers there for the
arm.

1355
01:39:26,199 --> 01:39:29,119
Everything related to the arm is done looking
out toward the payload bay.

1356
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:30,630
The arm is attached there.

1357
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:33,520
When you are doing rendezvous you're looking
out at the overhead windows of the vehicle

1358
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:34,590
you are approaching.

1359
01:39:34,590 --> 01:39:40,670
So, in effect, you have a couple of these
CRT displays and identical hand controller

1360
01:39:40,670 --> 01:39:47,670
and the equivalent then or the updated equivalent
now of these displays on a back station.

1361
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:56,320
To avoid any issues of changing controllers
and changing viewpoints, you might note that

1362
01:39:56,329 --> 01:39:59,989
normally the controls that are done out of
the back window with that separate controller

1363
01:39:59,989 --> 01:40:03,489
and separate displays are done by different
crew members.

1364
01:40:03,489 --> 01:40:09,010
That is typically a mission specialist's job,
not a pilot or commander job, and so they

1365
01:40:09,010 --> 01:40:10,280
are separately trained.

1366
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:10,699
Right.

1367
01:40:10,699 --> 01:40:12,389
That's an important point.

1368
01:40:12,389 --> 01:40:17,079
For rendezvous and docking, it is the pilot
or commander who uses the aft controls to

1369
01:40:17,079 --> 01:40:22,650
control [NOISE OBSCURES].

1370
01:40:22,650 --> 01:40:24,670
Do you know?

1371
01:40:24,670 --> 01:40:27,810
I believe that everything related to the RMS
that you said is correct.

1372
01:40:27,810 --> 01:40:31,780
But for a rendezvous the commander is always
involved.

1373
01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:38,780
But the point was that in that case that is
done out the rear window.

1374
01:40:39,949 --> 01:40:42,900
It is still done at the rear window, so he
has got to mentally reverse his frame of reference

1375
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:43,880
while he is doing that.

1376
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:44,619
That is correct.

1377
01:40:44,619 --> 01:40:51,389
[NOISE OBSCURES] And that is something that
I think will not be done with the CEV.

1378
01:40:51,389 --> 01:40:58,239
The same frame of reference will be used on
the CEV because I think that has always been

1379
01:40:58,239 --> 01:41:04,750
a little bit of a point of contention in the
problems of maintaining simultaneous proficiency.

1380
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:09,610
For remote manipulation with the arm that
has been an issue.

1381
01:41:09,610 --> 01:41:10,010
Yeah.

1382
01:41:10,010 --> 01:41:15,800
And I think that has always been done by uniquely
trained mission specialists.

1383
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:17,199
That's right.

1384
01:41:17,199 --> 01:41:21,969
Today's cockpit looks a lot more like what
you will see on a commercial airliner vintage

1385
01:41:21,969 --> 01:41:28,969
mid `80s, the late `80s perhaps, but still
more familiar where you've got glass multicolored

1386
01:41:30,030 --> 01:41:30,900
displays.

1387
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:37,900
The eight ball still exists in image form
because that is what a lot of the astronauts

1388
01:41:39,349 --> 01:41:41,079
used to learn how to fly these vehicles.

1389
01:41:41,079 --> 01:41:48,079
They still fly with respect to it, except
it is a digital representation, but you're

1390
01:41:48,780 --> 01:41:51,909
still not with the gooey environment.

1391
01:41:51,909 --> 01:41:54,090
You still won't have touch pads or a mouse.

1392
01:41:54,090 --> 01:41:55,829
It is all pushbutton displays.

1393
01:41:55,829 --> 01:42:00,980
And there is a case to be made that touch
displays or touch screens don't work very

1394
01:42:00,980 --> 01:42:04,300
well in a vehicle where you G environments
keep changing.

1395
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:09,760
It is very difficult to get a touch display
that works with a light touch and a heavy

1396
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:15,389
touch when you're in zero G or when you're
pulling several Gs.

1397
01:42:15,389 --> 01:42:20,050
Even if the technology was space qualified,
it is not clear that they would use it, except

1398
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:23,690
on a vehicle that stays in a constant environment.

1399
01:42:23,690 --> 01:42:28,560
At this point, let me introduce Dr. Hayashi.

1400
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:35,560
Miwa Hayashi is, in fact, at NASA Ames Research
Center now, was here at MIT and worked on

1401
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:40,860
the design of the next generation of the Shuttle
cockpit upgrade.

1402
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:47,429
In fact, that is what you will be talking
about in ten minutes across the hall in the

1403
01:42:47,429 --> 01:42:47,969
16.400 class.

1404
01:42:47,969 --> 01:42:54,420
It is essentially what would have been done
if Shuttle life had been extended.

1405
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:58,940
I might add that, although the room is very
crowded, if a few of you would like to sort

1406
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:04,730
of hear where this story would have gone,
you're welcome to come across the hall to

1407
01:43:04,730 --> 01:43:06,400
419 and hear Dr. Hayashi.

1408
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:10,929
And you are also giving a lab meeting lecture
at 1:00.

1409
01:43:10,929 --> 01:43:14,500
Could you tell us that subject?

1410
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:21,000
That is about the astronaut scanning behavior.

1411
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:26,659
Our team had a model about the astronaut's
scanning behavior in the cockpit, this upgraded

1412
01:43:26,659 --> 01:43:26,960
cockpit.

1413
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:29,510
Anyone interested in this kind of topic you
are welcome.

1414
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:30,320
It is from 1:00 PM 33206.

1415
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:30,590
Thank you.

1416
01:43:30,590 --> 01:43:31,000
Go ahead, Phil.

1417
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:35,210
Well, at this point, I think I'm open to a
few more questions.

1418
01:43:35,210 --> 01:43:42,210
We have a couple of minutes for further questions,
any topic we've covered or that's related

1419
01:43:42,329 --> 01:43:44,420
that we didn't cover.

1420
01:43:44,420 --> 01:43:44,940
Yeah?

1421
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:51,940
You talked a lot about the constraints of
the invented computers.

1422
01:43:57,989 --> 01:44:04,989
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] Well, we had very large
facilities for that purpose that evolved over

1423
01:44:10,969 --> 01:44:11,469
time.

1424
01:44:11,469 --> 01:44:16,510
The first major facility was the Flight Simulation
Laboratory in Downing, California, which was

1425
01:44:16,510 --> 01:44:17,750
then Rockwell.

1426
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:24,360
You had a room with a couple cockpits, you
had another room which had the digital interfaces

1427
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:31,360
of the cockpit, and a half a floor with the
analog computers that provided a lot of the

1428
01:44:32,659 --> 01:44:36,480
information generation at a rate that was
not achievable with digital systems.

1429
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:43,480
You had this hybrid system for driving what
were man-in-the-loop simulations.

1430
01:44:43,909 --> 01:44:50,909
And we spent 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
using those labs for several years.

1431
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:54,380
I would often go out to California and be
on the 5:00 PM to 5:00 AM shift often spanning

1432
01:44:54,380 --> 01:44:54,630
weekends.

1433
01:44:54,579 --> 01:45:01,579
By the way, I was doing that, I think, when
I was still a graduate student, which was

1434
01:45:02,199 --> 01:45:04,380
kind of an interesting experience.

1435
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:10,670
But then NASA built the Shuttle Avionics Integration
Laboratory in Houston which eventually superseded

1436
01:45:10,670 --> 01:45:13,770
the laboratory at Rockwell.

1437
01:45:13,770 --> 01:45:15,560
That became an all-digital system.

1438
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:16,650
The hybrid systems went away.

1439
01:45:16,650 --> 01:45:22,929
The high capacity computers, they could fit
in one good size room everything they needed,

1440
01:45:22,929 --> 01:45:28,949
and were able to get much more digital displays
for the crews.

1441
01:45:28,949 --> 01:45:32,960
Sometimes what they used to do for the imagery
of the crew in the early days is they would

1442
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:37,199
actually drive a camera across a simulated
scene because you couldn't generate the scene.

1443
01:45:37,199 --> 01:45:42,480
By the time they got the sail facility developed
they were able to do scene generation with

1444
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:48,239
fairly high computers.

1445
01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:49,820
Now everything could almost be tabletop.

1446
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:54,429
I mean it is just so dramatic as how this
evolved over the years.

1447
01:45:54,429 --> 01:45:58,199
The one thing they had at Rockwell that never
got replaced, though, is they also were able

1448
01:45:58,199 --> 01:46:02,329
to put into the loop actual hydraulic systems.

1449
01:46:02,329 --> 01:46:08,389
When they were doing entry they could turn
on aero surfaces and hydraulics with simulated

1450
01:46:08,389 --> 01:46:09,579
loads.

1451
01:46:09,579 --> 01:46:13,579
And you always knew when they were doing it
because the high pitch scream of the APUs,

1452
01:46:13,579 --> 01:46:16,630
when they were doing it, you could hear two
blocks away.

1453
01:46:16,630 --> 01:46:16,900
OK.

1454
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:17,449
Last question.

1455
01:46:17,449 --> 01:46:24,449
Sir, I was wondering if you could give kind
of a concept of the cost of developing the

1456
01:46:32,530 --> 01:46:35,570
software either in man hours or in comparison
of what they spent on the hardware.

1457
01:46:35,570 --> 01:46:41,250
Well, the initial development of the system
probably involved the equivalent of 15 or

1458
01:46:41,250 --> 01:46:48,250
20 full time people for a few years.

1459
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:55,349
And this was to develop the algorithms and
support the validation.

1460
01:46:55,349 --> 01:46:59,869
The actual flight software was actually produced
by IBM separately.

1461
01:46:59,869 --> 01:47:04,349
And they had a small team of people that would
take the detail design specifications and

1462
01:47:04,349 --> 01:47:11,349
create

1463
01:47:19,270 --> 01:47:21,610
the software.

1464
01:47:21,610 --> 01:47:28,610
It is a big effort but a very small part of
the cost of developing a Shuttle.

1465
01:47:36,989 --> 01:47:40,150
I mean you measure the Shuttle in billions.

1466
01:47:40,150 --> 01:47:43,540
You measure the flight software development
in millions.

1467
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:50,540
One thing that I remember when the software
was developed and we were working and validating

1468
01:47:50,949 --> 01:47:56,659
it, IBM wanted every line of code change in
million dollars.

1469
01:47:56,659 --> 01:48:02,159
A million dollars for one line of code change
because they had to verify the whole software.

1470
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:06,940
That is why you would never, unless there
was a flight critical thing, do that.

1471
01:48:06,940 --> 01:48:13,940
NASA wanted generally, whenever possible,
to aggregate changes for a year or maybe two

1472
01:48:14,590 --> 01:48:15,599
years sometimes.

1473
01:48:15,599 --> 01:48:20,070
And then put them in there just for that reason
because there was this huge cost of revalidating.

1474
01:48:20,070 --> 01:48:22,360
And that was the IBM cost.

1475
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:25,639
It would be a cost to bringing us back in
to certify that, too.

1476
01:48:25,639 --> 01:48:29,159
Well, it worked and you should be very proud
of it, you and your colleagues.

1477
01:48:29,159 --> 01:48:29,630
Thank you very much, Phil.

1478
01:48:29,630 --> 01:48:29,880
Thank you.

1479
01:48:29,719 --> 01:48:29,969
