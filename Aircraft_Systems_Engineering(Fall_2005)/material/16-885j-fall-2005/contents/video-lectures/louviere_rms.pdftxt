Shuttle Orbiter


Remote Manipulator System


Mechanical Systems


Exploratory Development


0 Shuttle Orbiter was designed with a capability to transport large Payloads 

0 In general the concept was to bring varied payloads to various orbital 
altitudes and inclinations 

0 Initial Orbiter configuration had a large payload bay with a significant 
payload capability – 65,000lbs, 15ft diameter, 60ft long. 

0 Initial design did not define a concept for handling payloads 

0 NASA resources were used to assure Shuttle Transportation System’s 
flight worthiness as prime objective 

0 Manipulator Concepts were initiated in the early 1970’s – competed for 
resources with other programs: 
- Skylab 
- Apollo Soyez Test Project 
- Prime objective of Shuttle Transportation System 

Exploratory Development – Concept Definition


0 NASA Centers explored many concepts – all had shortcomings 

0 Most payload handling systems were designed to perform either 
deployment or retrieval tasks. None were proficient at both tasks. 

0 Manipulators were  contenders once requirements became more
 refined. 

0 JSC - Spacecraft Design Division began to assign resources to understand 
the functions, design and operations of manipulators 

0 Initial studies included use of available Atomic Energy Commission 
manipulators that were designed for remote handling of radio active items 

0 Analyses indicated that exploratory hardware development was necessary 

0 Objectives were to determine the mix of handling and design requirements 

Concept Development 


0 Initial test with master slave systems indicated that several design 
requirements were not compatible with ergonomics or available 
resources of the Orbiter Flight Deck 
- Large sweep volume was required 
- Ratcheting of master to change movement ratio 

0 The tactile feedback was very desirable for dexterous operations 

0 Available master-slave units were of small size; though dexterous, 
amplification to a large cargo handing system was marginal 

0 During several tests, operators arm became tired 

0 Master-slave concept was maintained for future testing – other 
control schemes analysis were initiated

Determination of Concept Requirements 


0 Initial operations indicated that a larger system was needed to determine
 needed requirements 

0 An industrial Manipulator was purchased to continue concept development 
- A G.E. hydraulic manipulator was located
- It was formerly used by Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. 
- 25 feet long used for moving plate glass
- Master-Slave control system
- Vacuum end effector 

0 Several concept elements to be analyzed 
- Master-Slave/alternate concept
- Feedback vs fixed hand controller
- Viewing – line sight/TV 
- End effector configuration
- Power source
- Size, joint speed, tip speed
- Payload/cargo handling
- Satellite Capture and Retrieval

Small Facility – Building 13 High Bay  


0 The larger manipulator required a much larger floor space to accommodate 
the initial development and anticipated growth-manipulator approx 30ft 

0 Analysis indicated that an air bearing floor was needed 

0 The Initial floor was about 25 ft by 30 ft in size; the floor was sufficiently 
smooth to accommodate: 
- Heavy weight payloads- air bearings 
- Stationary payloads 
- Free flying satellites- air bearings 

0 Initial findings determined several requirements 
- Master-slave system was used but not optimum 
- Feedback was not a facilitator 
- Line of sight and TV would be required 
- No suitable end effector configuration was defined 
- End effector tip speed was defined 
- Moving satellites could be captured and retrieved 
- Analyses defined that an orbital hydraulic system was not optimum 

Larger Facility – Building 9A


0 Larger facilities were required to develop and confirm requirements 

0 As requirement developed, full scale Orbiter mockups were needed 
to  prove scale integrity 

0 In addition to the full scale Orbiter Trainers/Mockups, an entire building
 was fabricated to confirm manipulator proof of concept 

0 A new smoother floor was fabricated – approximately 60ft x 40ft 

0 Manipulator sized increased to simulate concept for Orbiter and installed 
   in a full scale mockup – 50ft length with hydraulic to simulate electrical system 

0 Large scale payloads were also needed 

0 A complete retention system was also devised to hold the payloads 

0 Analysis and design began to develop a fixed hand controller concept

Backup – Failure Modes 


0 Backup Mode 
- Joint or electrical failure was most likely necessity for a 
backup mode 
- Single Joint mode 
- As implied, commands a single joint 
- This mode is computer supported 
- Direct joint mode 
- Commands single joint 
- Commands transmitted by hard wire 

0 Jettison 
- Failure that would prohibit RMS operation 
- Would jeopardize safety 
- Non propulsive jettison is performed 
- Expedited Jettison is also available 

Concluding Remarks – Remote Manipulator System


0 Though initial requirements were not well defined, the use of development 
concepts and hardware did enhance a workable system 

0 Use of available technology and equipment expedited the derivation of the 
the flight design 

0 Integration of the Crewman into the system did require adjustments in the 
the control system 

0 Initial inflatable testing was crucial in determining feasibility and viability
 of the design 

0 International cooperation was not a hindrance in Remote Manipulator 
development 

0 The initial design though upgraded with improvements is still flying
