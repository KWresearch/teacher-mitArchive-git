Break into 2 sessions 
–	 OMS RCS first session / APU Hydraulics second 
Talk for about 30 minutes with 30 minutes for questions. 
Ask questions anytime. No lecture– I will throw a few things out and 
we will talk about them. 
Cover APU/ Hydraulics the same way. 
Cover the start of the Space Shuttle Program 
–	
`Max Appointed Jim Chamberlain To head Study Group. 
–	
I sent the best Engineer I had. 
–	 He balked 
–	 Quickly run through Many configurations 

	 Understand the impact of requirements very clearly 
	 Fail OP fail safe good buzz word but can make a system less safe. 
I can make a case that a 2 engine aircraft is safer then a 4 engine 
	
aircraft because of the way requirements are written. 

  Original requirements 
  Low cost of operations 
  Oxygen/Hydrogen 
  Oxygen/ Methane 
  Oxygen/Alcohol 

  Requirements changed to Low development costs

  OMS  went to Bipropellant 
  MMH?N204 
  Lot of experience-Apollo Agena 
  Performance—Long steady state burns 
  RCS went to Monopropellant hydrazine 
  Too Heavy—Weight in Back 
  Changed to Bi Propellant MMH/N2O4 

•  Development Program

– Remember

•  It is not natural for Earth bound humans to think in 
terms of no gravity 
•  It is not natural for earth bound humans to think in 
terms of the absence of pressure. 
– There is no substitute for a good test program

•  No vibration test 
– Had good structural programs 
» Helium bottle fell out during Vibration test. 

•  Differences between OMS and RCS

–	 OMS has few starts 
•	 Performance is critical 
–	 RCS thousands of starts 

•	 Very short (millisecond burns) to steady state burns of 500 or 
more seconds 
•	 Must operate over a wide range of mixture ratios and inlet 
pressures. 
•	 Dribble volume—effect of refrigeration—Helium saturation. 
•	 Effects of no gravity on Expulsion. 

•  Questions: 

APU/Hydraulics


•	 Will cover both Subsystems together because they are 
so closely related. 
•	 Like OMS/RCS went through many iterations

–	 Fail op-fail op-fail safe VS fail safe 
–	 Big mistake to call APU Auxiliary Power unit 
•  Should have been called PPU—Primary power unit. 
–	 Low Operational costs VS low development costs. 
–	 Power Requirements 
•  Aero and Control people Want instant response. 
–  Weight carried in someone else's budget. 
–	 Dual Tandem actuators 
–	 4 VS 3 Systems 
–	 Hydraulics VS Electromechanical 

•  Power Source 
–  Electric VS Turbine 
•  Turbine Development 
–  Hydrogen/Oxygen 
–  MMH/N2O4 
–  Hydrazine 
–  Pressure modulated VS Pulse Modulated 
–  Absent of gravity on Gearbox development 
•  Used gears to pump oil to sump 
–  Absent of air and gravity on gas Generator development. 
•  Heat soaked to valve in vacuum. 
•  Added water spray for several flights 
•  Hydraulics 
–  Hydraulics mostly off the shelf. 
•  Added bellows and pressure source to Hydraulic reservoir 
•  Added Water boiler to cool Hydraulic fluid. 
–  First concept was to run the hydraulic fluid through a bucket of water. 
Importance of good test program and to think in terms of no gravity and no pressure.
