The Shuttle Origin 
or 
The Making of a new Program

by 
Dale Myers 

Pre Lunar Landing Planning


  2/61-10/68  Jim Webb didn’t want future

plans—wanted to keep options open

	 3/69-9/70 Tom Paine never saw a future plan 
he didn’t like 
	 1/64-10/68-Lots of lifting body work

	 10/68-early 70 NASA dreamed of ever 
increasing budgets, and planned accordingly 

Initial Public Awareness

1969 

  Agnew Study- with Bob Seamans, Tom Paine, Lee Dubridge 
  Supported by NASA’s ideas 
  30 ft Diameter, 12 man Space Station 
  2 in earth orbit, one in Lunar orbit 
  Lunar Base 
  Two stage fully recoverable Shuttle 
  100-150 flights per year 
  SkyLab with 5 visits by Command Modules 
  Continue Saturn 1b and Saturn V production 
  Space tug for higher orbits than LEO 
  Nuclear stage for Moon and Mars 
  Mars program by 1983 

Meanwhile, the Budget Crash


	 Euphoria of 1968 followed by severe cuts

	 Vietnam, Great Society budget deficits were 
causes, Nixon not a big supporter 
	 1966 MSF budget=$3.8B, 1972=$1.7B

	 Was there going to be a human space 
program at all? 
	 Mueller leaves in late 1969 
	 Paine leaves in late 70 (Low acting Admin.)

	 Myers (1/70) and Fletcher (4/71) 

NASA Strategy-1970 


	 Shuttle is first priority, because low cost to space will 
encourage all the Agnew Report items later 
	 Start 2 stage Shuttle Phase B, and 
	 Cancel Apollo 18 and 19 and Saturn 1b and V 
	 Cancel 2nd  Skylab and CSM’s 
	 Cancel 30 ft. Space Stations 
	 Don’t start Space Tug 
	 Don’t start Nuclear Stage 
  Cancel Mars program

Industry down from 400,000 to 150,000


The Concept for a Shuttle


	 Reusability equals low cost

	 “you wouldn’t fly to New York and throw away the 
airplane” 
	 Since R & D is higher, need many flights to 
beat ballistic systems 
	 The lower the R & D the less flights needed 
to beat ballistic systems 
	 If flights are many (because cost/flight is so 
low) a two stage, fully reusable system is 
right 

The Technology Development 
1950-1970 

  Burnelli lifting body

  X-20 Dynasoar delta wing 
  HL-10 Lifting body 
  X-24A-Lifting body 
  X-15-Winged, internal fuel 
  X-15-Winged, internal and external fuel 

  Navaho M=3 parallel tank separation 

Burnelli Lifting Body


Evolution of the Shuttle

1969-1971


	 Fully reusable two stage Straight wing, like 
an X-15 
	 Internal fuel 
	 Metal shingles (or unobtainium or some ablative) 
	 20000 lb. payload, due east 
	 Payload bay 12X40? 
	 400 miles crossrange 
	 100 to 150 flights/year 
	 $5 Million/flight in 1970 dollars 

Meanwhile, the Mission Model


	 When the Space Station, lunar base, etc. 
disappeared, we needed more payloads 
(50+/year) 
	 Military agreed to put all payloads on Shuttle if we 
increased payload and designed for 1500 miles of 
crossrange, and met our cost/flight estimates. 
	 Commercial agreed to carry all payloads on 
Shuttle (assumed we would develop a low cost 
upper stage and meet cost/flight estimates). 
	 Science bought space servicing (i.e. Hubble) and 
a low cost reusable platform 

Evolution of Requirements 
(mostly from Military Requirements) 
  Payload increased to 40,000 lbs Polar 
  Crossrange increased to 1500 miles 
  Payload bay increased to 15 by 60 
  Non ablative reusable thermal protection 
  Two fully recoverable piloted stages 
  Automatic checkout and 30 day turnaround


Evolution II 


	 Phase B showed Development of two stage fully 
recoverable Shuttle costs $14B for R&D 
	 Nixon says “Build any shuttle you want as long as it 
doesn’t cost more than $5B” 
	 OMB says “make it cost effective” 
	 NASA looked for alternatives with new Phase A 
	 Single Stage to orbit 
	 Trimese 
	 X24B surrounded with tanks 
	 External Orbiter tanks 
	 Parallel or series booster 

The Mathematica Study


	 To convince OMB, Nixon and Congress 
	 We hired Mathematica to do cost effectiveness study 
	 Results showed today’s configuration best

	 Delta wing for crossrange 
	 Weight increase for military payloads 
	 15 x 60 payload bay (15 for Space Station, 60 for 
military) 
	 40,000 lb. payload, polar 
	 Parallel External throwaway monocoque tank 
	 2 Recoverable, abortable solids 
	 Liftoff thrust augmentation with engines in Orbiter 

Resulting Program

Nixon Start on Jan. 5, 1972 
5 Orbiters 
	 Reusable Orbiter and engines, reusable solid 
cases, expendable fuel tank 
	 40 to 50 flights per year 
	 $10M-$15M per flight in 1970$ 
	 $5.2B+20% reserve for R & D in 1970$* 
*As soon as Nixon left office, OMB forgot the 20% reserve 
•	
•	 NASA Comptroller (pressed by OMB) didn’t agree to 1970 base 

Design Issues


  Straight vs Delta wing 
  Delta wing required for crossrange 
  External vs internal tank(s) 
  External much lighter. Fuel transfer difficult 
  Thermal Insulation 
  Ceramic tiles, carbon-carbon and blankets 
  Solids or liquid booster 
  Solids looked more reliable and cheaper R&D 
  Engine location and type 
  Start on ground safer, better performance 
  Staged combustion better performance 
  Retractable turbojets 
  No--Depend on low L/D landings 
  Series vs parallel boosters 
  Series heavy, less performance 

Design Issues cont’d


	 2 Solids vs. 1 or 2 Liquid strapons 
	 Two solids could be shipped by rail 
	 Solids had a better reliability record 
	 Solids could be recovered (industry studied pressure fed) 
	 Designers thought they could turn off solids. 
	 Later found they could not 
	 Thermal Insulation 
	 Ceramic tiles, carbon carbon, and external insulation 
blankets (all new) 
	 High pressure staged combustion engine (new) 
	 Crew escape.  (Only with complete structure) 
	 Operations Costs 

Operations Costs


	 Enormous confidence from the Apollo program 
	 Studies by American Airlines, IDA and the Aerospace 
Corporation nearly confirmed NASA operations costs 
	 NASA thought they had enough reliable, space based hardware 
in the industry to support quick turnaround, easy to maintain 
hardware 
	 NASA did not properly account for costs associated with: 
	 Post flight maintenance 
	 Assuring safety of flight in a hostile environment 
	 Difficult cutting edge technology (Engine and Thermal) 
	 FO/FO/FS 
	 Cost tradeoffs between R & D and Operations 

Operations Cost


	

In 1970, $10M/flight price was based on same 
accounting system used for Apollo-hands on only, with 
a separate account for overhead. 
	 With $400M/year overhead, and inflation according to 
the consumers price index, cost per flight  would be: 

1970 
40 flts/year, no overhead     $10M 
40 flts/year, include ovhd.    $20M 
8 flts/yr, include overhead   $60M 

1981 
$23M 
$45M 
$135M 

2005 
$50M 
$101M 
$302M


Shuttle Performance


	 The Shuttle has done everything it was designed to do.  It has 
delivered Military, commercial, and scientific payloads to LEO 
and GEO, retrieved and replaced satellites, repaired spacecraft, 
and launched elements of the Space Station 
In the 80’s, shuttle had 4% of launches, 41% of mass launched 
	
	 Shuttle R&D was within what Nixon and Fletcher agreed. ($5.2B 
+20% reserve in 1970$) 
	 Missed two key design issues (cold O rings and foam shedding) 
	 Missed operations costs.  A two stage reusable system would 
have missed worse. Spacecraft are not “like an airplane”. 

Spacecraft are not like Airplanes


	 Every flight is a “structural dive demo.”

	 No reusable space system gets millions of 
hours of stressed operation 
	 No reusable space system develops decades 
of evolutionary model improvement 
  Every reusable system is exposed to

enormous environmental variations

	 Thermal, vibration, pressure, Mach Number 

So, for the next program 


	 Keep it simple. 
	 Don’t stretch the technology 
	 Use good margins of safety 
	 Keep it as small as possible 
	 Carry as few passengers as possible 
	 Carry people or cargo, not both 
	 Keep requirements to a minimum 
	 Use as many past components and systems as have 
been proven reliable 
	 Design for operations 
	 Easy access, one man can replace boxes, etc. 
	 Keep a program design reserve to reduce Ops. costs
