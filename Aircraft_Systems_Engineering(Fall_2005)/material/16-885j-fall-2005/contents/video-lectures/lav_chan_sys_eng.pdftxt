Chandra X-ray Observatory:  History 


o  AXAF MISSION DEFINITION STUDY BEGAN IN 1978. 
- Based upon successful HEAO series 

- Extrapolated results and new technology improvements to derive top level performance.  

- Maintained a “study” level of effort for several years.  

- In order to “sell” concept, elected early on to involve independent (non-profit) party, SAO, 

 to review all telescope studies and work 
- Also brought on-board a senior telescope scientist and various interdisciplinary scientists
 in 1985. 

o  TRW WAS SELECTED AS PRIME CONTRACTOR IN 1988 

o  AXAF WAS GIVEN A NEW START IN 1989. 
- Full new start authority was contingent upon successful completion of mirror technology
 test 
- Test mandated by congress in 1991 and completed successfully and on-time. 
- NASA HQ approved for a new start with metrics along the way 

14 

Chandra X-ray Observatory:  History 


o  TO REDUCE LIFE CYCLE COST,  PROGRAM RESTRUCTURED IN 1992 
- Imaging mission 
o  Reduced mirror pairs from 6 to 4 
o  Dropped 2 focal plane instruments (now only 2, plus 2 gratings) 
o  Dropped servicing requirement 
o  Changed lifetime from 15 years to 5 years 
o  Placed into higher orbit to increase observing time and preserve science
 objectives 

- Spectroscopy mission 

o  Took one of the instruments and built a mission around it 
o  To save cost, this was to be built totally in-house at MSFC 

o  NATIONAL ACAEDMY OF SCIENCES ENDORSED PROGRAM 

o  AXAF-SPECTROSCOPY MISSION WAS CANCELLED BY SENATE IN 1994 
- Program was on track and within cost (?!) 

- Smaller version of the instrument slated for the Japanese mission ASTRO-E 

- ASTRO-E mission was lost during ascent earlier this year.

Why is imaging so important? 

Imaging allows scientists to pinpoint where in space the x-rays are coming from. 
The more precision the telescope has, the better the resolution to identify the 
X-rays.  This allows even further detail and scientific discovery in understanding 
more about the object and how it came to be.

1.  Mirrors (TECHNICAL)
 o 	 BIGGESST CHALLENGE WAS MIRROR DEVELOPMENT 
- Mirrors had never been figured to this precision for this size 
- Program needed to develop innovative approach to mirror fabrication and testing

 o 	 SUBSCALE STRATEGY 
- Develop single mirror pair comparable to smallest Chandra (AXAF) mirror pair 
- Demonstrate technology to build mirrors 
- Develop in-process metrology, feed metrology data into computer modeling, predict
 resulting mirror performance, and validate with newly-developed optical test methods 
- Program developed Technology Mirror Assembly (TMA) 
- Program selected/developed 3 types of metrology measurements 
- All measurements were fed into analytical software programs to predict performance. 
- Predicted performance was compared to actual performance of mirrors. 
o	 The initial performance did not quite match predictions. 
o	 A small gap was found between the 3 types of metrology metrics that left
 some part of mirror surface undefined. 
o	 Metrology was enhanced; mirror flaw was found; mirror was re-polished.

High Resolution Mirror Assembly (HRMA)


Chandra X-ray Observatory:  Challenges 


What makes Chandra Unique? 

Chandra has outstanding imaging precision; its mirrors are the largest, the most 
perfectly aligned, and smoothest ever built.  The images Chandra makes are 25 
times sharper than the best previous x-ray telescope.

Chandra X-ray Observatory:  Challenges


1.  Mirrors (TECHNICAL)
 o 	 IN-PROCESS METROLOGY MEASUREMENTS AND CROSS-CHECKS 
- 4 independent metrology measurements on mirrors 
- Each has overlapping frequencies so that cross-checks with one or more of the other
 metrology devices is performed. 
- Each metrology measurement device was improved over the TMA devices. 
- The testing of the metrology devices was extensive. 
- During the mirror assembly, a co-located team of Government and contractor personnel
 reviewed all of the metrology data as it was taken.

 o 	 EARLY TESTING OF LARGEST MIRROR PAIR MANDATED BY CONGRESS 
- H1/P1 tested in a VETA-1 (Verification Test Article) configuration at MSFC’s XRCF 
- Testing was performed on-time and showed performance better than mandated spec value. 
- A second development test, VETA-2, took outer mirror pair and assembled them into a
 flight High Resolution Mirror Assembly (HRMA) using nominal procedures and Ground
 Support Equipment (GSE) 
o	 This HRMA (with mass simulators for remaining shells) was shaken as a 
structural test article to verify alignment stability 

18 

Chandra X-ray Observatory:  Challenges


1.  Mirrors (TECHNICAL)
 o  END-TO-END X-RAY TESTING OF FINAL HRMA ARTICLE 
- Performed at XRCF under direction of MSFC 

- Used flight science instruments and HRMA 

- Demonstrated quality mirrors and compared well with predictions


 o  KEY TO SUCCESS IS GOOD SYSTEMS ENGINEERING 
- Necessary because of multiple separate parties, academia,  non-profits, and foreign groups 
- LESSON LEARNED:  Perform multiple cross-checks wherever possible 
- LESSON LEARNED:  Let more than one group perform review 
- LESSON LEARNED:  No substitute for direct test or measurement 
- LESSON LEARNED:  Keep science informed and part of the decision-making process 
- LESSON LEARNED:  Establish error budgets and allocate error terms early on, and
 continually review them

Chandra X-ray Observatory:  Challenges


2.  Descope (PROGRAMMATIC)
 o  NEXT BIGGEST CHALLENGE WAS COST – NASA HQ & CONGRESS DID NOT 
WANT TO PAY THE INITIAL PRICE 
- Total recurring cost was problem 

- Solution:  Remove servicing and reduce life from 15 yrs to 5 yrs. 

- 2 instruments were dropped as well 

- Also, Systems Engineering was cut!


 o  MITIGATION 
- Finally settled on moving Chandra to a higher orbit to minimize earth eclipse but it needed
 to be high enough to avoid disturbance from Van Allen radiation belts. 
- To go higher in orbit, Chandra had to lose weight so that an upper stage could achieve the
 higher orbit. 
- Also studied new launch vehicles to achieve the best efficiency for the available funds. 
- Keep the Shuttle launch vehicle. 
- Weight needed to drop more than a factor of 2! 

20 

Chandra X-ray Observatory:  Challenges


Challenges 

2.  Descope (PROGRAMMATIC)
 o  WEIGHT REDUCTION 
- Use new technology lightweight composites for telescope. 

- MSFC had never used this percentage of composites for a large space structure 

- Since the mirrors were a significant weight contributor, 2 mirror pairs were dropped. 

- SIM was changed to all composite structure.


 o  WEIGHT REDUCTION IMPACTS 
- Developed new methods of analyzing total structure 
- Since composites crack, adopted a new handling paradigm to prevent damage 
- Developed new methods of structurally testing composite integrity 
- Since SI’s were cantilevered out in Shuttle cargo bay, weight problem remained acute for 
SI’s and SIM until late in program 
- SIM and SI’s weight containment policy resulted in constant attention and change and ate
 most of program slack 
- Universities had different structural analysis tools than contractors, so communication
 and common understanding was difficult at times.

- Keep communication flowing! 

- Be sensitive to the impact of changes to all areas not just the ones directly affected by a

 change.

 o  COMPENSATE FOR CONTRACTOR LOSS OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING EFFORT 
- Established Technical Oversight Panels 

- Controlled the external ICD’s and  led the ICD working groups 

- Perform all top-level (Level II) systems engineering activities 

- Establish technical presence at locations where the action is. 


22

Chandra X-ray Observatory:  Challenges


4.  Integrated Testing (ENGINEERING)
 o  INTEGRATION IS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE 
- Each group has a different test paradigm 
- Communication inherently tougher from group to group 
- Each group brings its own GSE, which is more often than not incompatible with the
   other groups’ hardware and software. 
- Logistics of who does what when must be carefully choreographed 
- Schedules and expectations are always optimistic and success-oriented 

o  CHALLENGE MET! 
- Created a working group to address integration both at Ball for the ISIM and later at TRW 
- Documented the integration and test planning in an ad hoc document 
- Good working relationship focused on teamwork and getting the job done 
- ISIM integration and testing went OK, but did have surprises that took some time to fix. 

27 

Chandra X-ray Observatory:  Challenges


4.  Integrated Testing (ENGINEERING)
 o  EVEN THE BEST LAID PLANS…… 
- During Observatory integration, TRW couldn’t
 hold schedule 
- Problem caused by antiquated EGSE and software 
- Exacerbated by unique test-only database 
- Funds to monitor activity and help out via systems
 engineering were cut during restructuring 
- Government did not pay enough attention and did
 not have a full-time Integration and Test lead. 
- Contractor chose a complicated software test script
 test methodology

 o  RECOVERY 
- Program Office initiated daily focus on schedule 
- Around-the-clock operations at the test site 
- New I&T Lead at TRW 
- More involvement of the MSFC technical Teams 
- MSFC technical presence to help out (not just
 critique) at the test site

- No bulk variations 
- No changes after XRCF calibration 
- No major changes to measured alignment of telescope after integration

6.  HRMA Alignment and Stability (TECHNICAL)
 o  UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS OCCUR!  EXAMPLE:  SPACECRAFT CHARGING 
- Very tight thermal requirements for HRMA and telescope led to choice of silverized
 Teflon thermal blankets 
- Teflon outer surface is dielectric; it builds up charge 
- In Chandra orbit, high degree of background plasma flux charges blankets 
- Blankets eventually discharge, which can disrupt signals either radiatively or conductively 
- Major effort on Chandra to first avoid and later mitigate problem 
- SI’s (being potential victims) wanted materials changed; Observatory contractor required
 surface for thermal reasons. 
- Thermal design won out, coupled with extensive testing and shielding of sensitive signals 
- Spark test developed to test radiative susceptibility 
- Other innovations made to reduce susceptibility, including evaluation of major Chandra-
level plasma test (ultimately rejected).

- LESSON LEARNED:  Put effort into error budgets, allocations, and analysis 
- LESSON LEARNED:  Get independent reviewers involved in data review 
- Final crosscheck performed at XRCF on HRMA and each shell wrt to the whole

 o  PAY ATTENTION TO HRMA STABILITY

 o  EXPECT UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS 
- During mirror assembly, noted focus alignment error after the bond dried on first mirror
 pair 
- Problem traced to temp difference of mirror with lights on versus lights off! 
- Mirrors were set with lights on 
- Lights resulted in mirror shape change 
- Post-bond measurement made with lights off! 
- Fortunately, there was enough margin in total error allocation to press without redo

7.  Cleanliness (ENGINEERING)
 o  MIRROR PERFORMANCE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO PARTICULATE AND 
MOLECULAR (FILM) CONTAMINATION 
- Much more sensitive than Hubble 

- No equivalent large-scale cleanliness capability existed at MSFC


 o  NEW METHODS REQUIRED 
- Better ways to measure contamination 
- Improved ways of cleaning hardware 
- Expanded database of allowable materials 
- New paradigm had to be followed to keep everything in the optical cavity or touching it at
 any time clean.

 o  FOCUS AREA – CONTAMINATION CONTROL 
- Science community helped push need 
- Contamination budgets set early and religiously followed 
- LESSON LEARNED:  Contamination guru identified on program whose sole job was 
contamination 
- Everything baked out to boil off contaminants

7.  Cleanliness (ENGINEERING)
 o  AS A RULE, BAKE OUT – EXCEPTION:  OPTICAL BENCH 
- Very controversial and emotional, but bottom line was that the benefit did not outweigh
 schedule and cost impact 
- Tested with wipe samples and monitored outgasing constituents during TV Test 
- Cleaned very thoroughly at Kodak and witnessed by outside parties 

o  IN SPACE, CONTAMINATES COLLECT AT LOWEST TEMPERATURE – RISK:  ACIS 
- As long as mirrors stayed hotter than surrounding, little contamination would accumulate. 
- As a backup measure for ACIS, the capability to bakeout the instrument on-orbit was
 provided. 
- LESSON LEARNED:  Develop backups

 o  MIRROR PERFORMANCE WOULD CHANGE (DEGRADE) IF CONTAMINATES ON 
SURFACE 
- To compensate, radioactive sources were mounted in door to directly measure
 contamination on-orbit 
- Radioactive sources also mounted on SIM to check ACIS periodically.

8.  Science Instrument Module (SIM) Mechanisms (TECHNICAL)
 o  SIM WAS A CHALLENGE 
- One axis translation and focus both required. 
- Very different thermal constraints from the telescope and SI’s, with ACIS in particular 
- Needed to be very light-weight, since its mass was at the cantilevered end of Chandra 
- Needed to be ultra-clean

 o  REQUIRED INNOVATION 
- Composite table structures  

- Innovative thermal coatings and adhesions  

- Active thermal control of composite flexures 

- New ways of structurally studying the composite flexures


 o  INNOVATIONS BRING PROBLEMS 
- Bonding and adhesion problems 

- Thermal material cracking 

- Moisture desorption alignment problems  

- Choice of acceptable lubrication

8.  SIM Mechanisms (TECHNICAL)
 o  RESULT:  SIM WAS DELAYED 
- Weight problem caused late readiness 

- Composite structural integrity testing harder than planned 

- Debonding occurred in first Thermal Vacuum test  

- Themal surfaces cracked during integration  

- Risk of mitigating each was weighed against option of schedule slip


 o  RECOVERY 
- LESSON LEARNED:  Define error budgets early and follow them 
- LESSON LEARNED:  Develop early ICD and iterate/communicate with all parties 
- Developed life test article to demonstrate compliance 
- Kept focus on both schedule awareness and meeting requirements 
- Use competent engineers, especially for alignment 
- LESSON LEARNED:  Send engineer to plant for critical periods to help move things along

9.  X-ray Calibration Facility (XRCF) (ENGINEERING)
 o  CHALLENGE:  XRCF READINESS 
- Needed early in the program and used periodically with increasing importance 
- Needed to become world-class clean vacuum facility 
- Required facility modifications 
- GSE for facility needed to be absolutely calibrated and ready to work before testing 
o  More accurate than the flight systems 
o  Clean as flight but earlier  

- Procedures needed to be developed and certified prior to testing


 o  LESSON LEARNED:  ASSIGN A SEPARATE ORGANIZATION FOR SPECIAL FOCUS 
- Could concentrate solely on XRCF as a multi-program facility 
- Selected very competent technical leader with Chandra technical experience 
- Trained them to be sensitive to contamination in everything they did

9.  X-ray Calibration Facility (XRCF) (ENGINEERING)
 o  RESPONSE: 
- Established frequent tagups to address schedule and worked pro-actively with contractors
 developing and bringing GSE to the XRCF 
- When HRMA finally arrived, became around-the-clock operation 
- Science had major role; to ensure smooth handoff, had daily shift meetings 
- Shifted into more of a test and integration mindset than hardware development mindset 
- LESSON LEARNED:  Concentrate on teamwork and communication 
- Work performed equally between XRCF operators, civil servants, contractors, scientists,
 and instrument personnel. 

- Since time was critical, everyone had an input into the schedule 


 o  RESULT: 
- Ultimately, XRCF performed extremely well 
- It is a world-class facility 
- It is preparing for future calibration work for JWST and Constellation X

10.  On-Orbit Proton Radiation (OPERATIONS)
 o  ACIS SUSCEPTIBILITY 
- Prior to launch, it was not expected that ACIS was susceptible to low energy protons and ions 
- Shielding in the HRMA and pre-collimator blocked radiation belts 
- Problem was, HRMA partially reflected ion proton and ion? radiation 
- Protons strike ACIS CCD’s and charge loss occurs when electrons are clocked off of the
 CCD 
- Prior to launch, electron reflections off the HRMA were expected and baffles and magnets
 were used to sweep electrons from focal path

 o  SOURCES 
- Radiation belts (below 60,000 km) 

- Solar flare 

- Galactic (generally all the time)


 o  MITIGATION 
- Move SIM to keep ACIS out of beam during threat 

- Develop acceptable error budget for gradual degradation (galactic) 

- Develop early warning system to note environment and react if it is threatening
