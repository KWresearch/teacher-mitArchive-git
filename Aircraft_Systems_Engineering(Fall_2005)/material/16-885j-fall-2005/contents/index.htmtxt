***** Course Highlights *****
This course was administrated by shuttle astronaut and MIT Professor Jeff
Hoffman and Professor Aaron Cohen, who was the Space Shuttle Orbiter Project
Manager.Â Guest speakers provideÂ the majority of the content inÂ video
lectures, discussing topics such as system design, accident investigation, and
the future of NASA's space mission.
***** Course Description *****
16.885J offers a holistic view of the aircraft as a system, covering: basic
systems engineering; cost and weight estimation; basic aircraft performance;
safety and reliability; lifecycle topics; aircraft subsystems; risk analysis
and management; and system realization. Small student teams retrospectively
analyze an existing aircraft covering: key design drivers and decisions;
aircraft attributes and subsystems; and operational experience. Oral and
written versions of the case study are delivered. For the Fall 2005 term, the
class focuses on a systems engineering analysis of the Space Shuttle. It offers
study of both design and operations of the shuttle, with frequent lectures by
outside experts. Students choose specific shuttle systems for detailed analysis
and develop new subsystem designs using state of the art technology.
