compute the formula (1) numerically for aluminum and compare your results with graph 4-63 in the 
book by Marmier and Sheldon.  Next, modify the formula for the case of an  α − particle and plot the 
curve for silicon and air over the energy range from 1 to 10 MeV. 
 
 
2.  As a means of degrading the energy of a proton beam from 6 MeV to half this value, the beam was 
passed through two adjacent metal foils having the same thickness but different composition.  The 
requisite slowing down was obtained when the foils were so arranged that the beam first passed through 
copper and then through gold.  Would it have made any difference if the foils had been interchanged, 
and if so, what would have been the mean energy of the emergent protons?   
 
 
3.  The energy loss of a heavy charged particle (charge  ze) of speed V in a material with n atoms per 
unit volume (atomic number Z) is,

energy of the particle at that speed.

4. The energy loss formula for heavy charged particles in a monoatomic substanceis is often written as 
 
 

4πe 4z 2
m e V 2 (nZ )Be  
 
where Be is called the atomic stopping number per electron. Suppose an absorbing material consists of a 
fraction f1 (by number) of atoms of kind 1 (Z1, A1) and a fraction f2 of atoms of kind 2 (Z2,.A2). (a) 
Derive an equation for the energy loss of heavy charged particles in this material in terms of Be1 and 
Be2. Call the mass density of the material ρ. (b) For 8 MeV alpha-particles, observed values of Be are 
5.6 for hydrogen and 4.0 for nitrogen. Compute the energy loss of 8 MeV alpha particles in ammonia 
(NH3) gas at NTP.
  
 
5.  An empirical formula for the mean range (in g/cm2) of electrons as a function of kinetic energy E (in 
MeV) have been given by Katz and Penfold: 
 

(3) 

 

R = 0. 412 E n    with   n = 1.265 − 0.0954 ln E    (0. 01 < E < 3 MeV)
R = 0. 530 E − 0.106    (2. 5 < E < 20  MeV)

   

 

(4) 

 
Plot a graph of E versus  R  in log-log scale. Give a table of ranges (in cm) in air and in aluminum at 
electron energies of 10 KeV, 100 KeV, 1.0 MeV and 10 MeV.
