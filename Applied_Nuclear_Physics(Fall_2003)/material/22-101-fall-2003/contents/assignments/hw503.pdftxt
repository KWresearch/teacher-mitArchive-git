Problem Set No.5

 
1.  In a Rutherford scattering experiment, one uses a  Po210  α -source which has Eα = 5.2 MeV and 
produces a collimated beam of intensity  1.1 x 105  counts/min. This beam is then incident on a gold foil 
of thickness 0.0001". A detector (scintillation) of an area 1.0 cm2 is placed at a distance of 30 cm away 
from the foil making a 15˚ angle from the incident beam direction. Calculate the expected count rate 
from the detector in counts per minutes. 
 
2.  The Rutherford formula is able to account satisfactorily for the scattering of protons from a thin  
90Th 232
 target up to an incident kinetic energy of  4.
  Use this observation to estimate a value 
3  MeV .
for the range of nuclear forces which brings about the deviation. 
 
3.  On irradiating a thick aluminum target with  7.8  MeV  α −  particles having a mean range 
R  =  2. 5  mg / cm 2 ,  one finds that 8 protons are produced by an  α , p(
)  reaction for every million 
incident  
particles. What is the mean cross section for this process?  Density of aluminum is 
α −
ρ  =  2. 69  gr / cm 3
. 
 
4.   Consider elastic scattering of neutrons with moderator atoms of a mass number A. Prove the 
following sets of relations.

You can prove this important result by simply using the empirical observation that the differential cross-
section of neutron scattering in the center of mass system is isotropic.

Show that for large A, the "lethargy" ξ parameter tends to the value 2 ( A + 2/3 ).

necessary to moderate a neutron with an initial energy   E  to the final energy  E   i.e.

5.  Assuming that the n-p cross-section in the energy range of 1 ev to 1 MeV is constant and equal to 
20 barns. Estimate the mean free path of neutrons in a solid hydrogen moderator. From this knowledge, 
estimate the distance a neutron would spread out from the place it is born. calculate for the case in which 
the neutron is born at 1MeV and the terminal energy is 1 ev.
