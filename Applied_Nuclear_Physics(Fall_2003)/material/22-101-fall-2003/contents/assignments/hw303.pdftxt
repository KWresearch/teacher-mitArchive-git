The roots of this equation can be determined by graphical means. It is found that there is a finite 
 
 
number of allowed  discrete  energies    E
1 , E 2 , E 3 , ... ... .
These are quantized energy levels of the 
bound  particle. 
Take the particle to have the electron mass  m = 9.108x10−28 gr. and  V 0 = 6 eV,   2a = 9. 6 Å.  It is 
 
convenient to use a dimensionless parameter    η = 2ma 2 V 0 (cid:61)2 = 36.  Show that there are only four 
 
 
allowed states. Find these energy  eigen values. Plot the wave functions of the first two states.  
It can be shown in general that the ground state (the lowest energy state) has no node and the first 
excited state has one node and the second excited state has two nodes, etc. in the region of the
