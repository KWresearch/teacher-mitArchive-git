1.  You are asked to derive in detail the low energy theorem for scattering of neutrons by a potential 
well. 
The potential well has a range b and a depth of -V0. Recall from the bound-state problem for the 
deuteron, we have the following relations: 
 
 
 
and                 α = MB (cid:61) 2 = 0. 232   fm(
)−1,    b ≤ 3 fm .  
 
In the scattering problem, the total energy is the center of mass neutron kinetic energy, 
E =
  
consistency relation from matching the radial wave function at the edge of the well is 
 
 
 
where  
 
 
 
(a)  By expanding the cotangent function on the left-hand side of Eq.(2), show that

This last relation shows that a small binding energy of the bound state will result in a large scattering 
length for the low energy scattering.

Eq.10 means that for neutron energy E below 10 MeV, we have a cross section of the form

which shows clearly that for thermal neutrons the total cross-section is simply a constant value  4 πa 2 , a 
very important result.

Derive the scattering length  a in terms of the potential parameters in the limit of zero energy. Derive the
