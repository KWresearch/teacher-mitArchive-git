1.  It is known that the proton and neutron in a deuteron can be broken apart by irradiating the deuteron 
with high-energy gamma rays. This is called the photo-nuclear  reaction. It is found that the 
threshold energy of the photo-nuclear  reaction is  E γ = 2.225MeV . Based on this energy and the

known masses, 
 and 
, calculate the neutron mass. 
 
2.  Show by the theory of electrostatic that the repulsive energy due to a uniform distribution of charge

become 1/2, if the charge is instead uniformly distributed over the surface. What would be the 
coefficient, if the charge is uniformly distributed over a spherical shell of an inner radius R1 and an 
outer radius R? 

 
3.  The semi-empirical mass formula with the Coulomb term derived from the assumption of a 
homogeneous volume distribution of charge yields values for the mass which, in the region of heavy 
U 238
nuclei, differ from measured values by at most 0.01 percent.  Using  
 as an example   
(M = 238.12  amu ) ,  show that this error limit absolutely rules out the other alternative of a uniform 
surface distribution of charge, even if the mass discrepancy were due exclusively to the Coulomb 
term. One could nevertheless conceive of other forms of charge distribution; for instance, a 
homogeneous distribution throughout the volume of a hollow spherical shell having an inner radius 
 and an outer radius R (equal to the nuclear radius).What is the largest value of the ratio   R

commensurate with the above mass ?

6.  When a thermal neutron (a neutron with practically zero kinetic energy in the energy scale we 
are considering in this problem) is captured in a nucleus with Z protons and N neutrons by a

The constants in the semi-empirical formula have values (in unit of MeV):

av = 14.1,   ac = 0.595,  as = 13.0,  aa = 19.0,  ap = 33.5 .

It is known that thermal neutrons can induce fission in 
. It is also 
, but cannot do so in 
known that in the latter case one needs to use high energy neutrons of energies greater than 1 MeV to 
induce the fission reaction. Your calculation is the explanation of this experimental fact.
