***** Plume Ridge Interactions *****
The Earth's crust is primarily composed of melting products from mantle plumes
and mid-ocean ridges - both presently and over the course of Earth history.
While both systems represent upwelling features in a convective mantle, they
can be viewed as end-member systems in that plumes represent buoyant flow
whereas mid-ocean ridges represent passive corner flow. This paradigm is not
strict - flow beneath ridges may be buoyant in some places, for example, but it
does provide a reasonable framework for enquiry.
Plumes and ridges can be studied independently, but in many places across the
globe the systems interact, often in intriguing fashion. The nature of these
interactions provides an opportunity to improve our understanding of both
systems, and provides new perspectives on the mantle, crustal, and water column
processes associated converting heat from the Earth's interior into new crust,
hydrothermal flow, and biological communities on the seafloor.
The approach taken for the 2001 Plume-Ridge Interactions Seminar series was to
start with basic ideas about mantle convection and tectonics, and an overview
of the global hotspot and ridge systems. We then addressed three case studies
of plume-ridge interactions in detail. Our first case was the interaction of
the Iceland plume - one of the largest plumes in the world - with the Northern
Mid-Atlantic Ridge. We then turned to the interaction of the Galapagos plume
with the Galapagos Spreading Center, and finished with the interaction of the
Cobb Plume with the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Each of these systems provides a
different perspective on the nature of plume-ridge interactions, and by
comparison and contrast we are able to distill the fundamental aspects out of
the complex array of geophysical and geochemical data associated with plume-
ridge systems.
***** Grading *****
Joint Program students enrolled in the Geodynamics seminar are required to
complete a project for the class. This includes research, an oral presentation
during the last two or three seminar meetings, and a written paper due at the
end of the semester. For first and second year students, the project must be on
a topic related to the theme of the seminar and must be different from their
main research interest. For more advanced students, the topic may be closely
related to their dissertation research.
