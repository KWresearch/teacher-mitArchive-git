Hydraulic Behavior of Granular Substrate 
 
In lecture we developed the following ideas and equations to describe the storage and flux of 
water in a porous (granular) media. 
 
Porosity - The porosity, n, is the fraction of volume occupied by pore spaces.  Only the pore 
spaces are available to hold or pass water.   For total volume, V, and pore volume, VP,  
 
(1) 
 
One can estimate the porosity by filling a known volume, V, with dry granular material.   Then, 
slowly pour water into the material, keeping track of how much water is added.  Add water until 
the water surface is just visible at the surface of the granular material.  The added water volume, 
VW = VP, such that n = VW/V. 
 
Darcy’s Law - Flow in a porous media is driven by gradients in hydraulic head,  
 
(2)  
 
Here z indicates elevation above a specified datum, p is the pressure, ρ is the density of the fluid  
and g is the gravitational constant.  The volumetric flow rate, Q[m3s-1] is then given by Darcy’s 
law, 
 
(3)   Q = -K A ∂h/∂x, 
 
where A is the cross-sectional area of the flow domain and K is the hydraulic conductivity.  The 
hydraulic conductivity will vary with grain size, d, and porosity, as well as with the fluid 
viscosity, μ.  The Kozeny-Carmen Equation captures these dependencies,

Laboratory Tasks 
1) Determine the porosity of each grain type using the method described above.  
 
2) Determine the hydraulic conductivity for each grain type. 
   
You will have  a  re-usable  test  column made  from  a  short piece of  tubing, of  length L  and  cross-
section  A.    Fill  the  column  with  one  of  the  grain  types  and  connect  it  into  the  water  source  at 
your station and the outlet you constructed via threaded couplings (don’t forget the Teflon tape!).  
By adjusting the valves you can adjust the pressure at the inflow (p1) and outflow (p2) of the test 
column.    Let  the  pressure  drop  be  ∆p=p2-p1.    If  the  test  column  is  horizontal,  then  the  head 
gradient across  the column  is ∂h/∂x = ∆p/ρgL.   For  four different ∆p determine  the  flow  rate, Q, 
by  capturing  a  volume  of  effluent,  Vol.  over  a  fixed  time  interval,  T,  i.e.  Q  =  Vol./T.      Plot  Q 
versus ∆pA/ρgL and use  the  fitted  linear slope  to estimate  the hydraulic conductivity, K.   Repeat 
this procedure for each substrate.  Note that with both valves closed, ∆p should be zero.  Use this 
to evaluate whether an offset exists in the pressure gages.  Be sure to correct for this offset.
