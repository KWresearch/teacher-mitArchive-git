***** Background *****
In certain regions, well water tends to be acidic. In eastern Massachusetts,
for example, the pH of precipitation can be as low as 4 or even lower, and in
the absence of enough neutralization by soils the resulting groundwater will
also be acidic. It is also possible for local geologic conditions to contribute
acidity to groundwater, as when organic acids are produced in wetlands.
One result is that water drawn from wells and springs can be acidic enough to
dissolve metals from distribution pipes. If the distribution pipes are of lead,
or-as is much more common nowadays-are of copper with connections soldered
together with lead containing solder, significant amounts of lead can be
dissolved into the drinking water that passes through the pipes. Although
quantitative measures of the dissolution of lead require chemical analysis of
the water, evidence for the corrosion of piping may be revealed by the presence
of blue-green stains on plumbing fixtures beneath water taps or shower heads.
The color is due to copper in the water; where copper is being dissolved, it is
a good bet that lead from lead-based solder is also.
One way to limit the dissolution of metals from the piping is eliminate the
metals from the piping system. In fact, in Massachusetts it is now required
that copper pipes in new houses be soldered with lead-free solder. This,
however, is of no help to the vast majority of older homes that have lead-based
solder. In these cases, raising the pH of the water to make it less corrosive
can be a way to mitigate the problem.
***** Specific Objectives of the Project *****
The task of this design exercise is to create and test a device that
neutralizes the acidity and hence much of the associated corrosivity of water
in a residential water system. Assume that the pH of water as pumped from a
water well for domestic use is 5.0. Assume that the pH must be raised to pH 7.0
or higher to decrease its corrosivity sufficiently.
The device that does this job must function over a range of flows typical of
household water use. The uses of most concern are, of course, drinking and
cooking. You will have to decide what flow rates are acceptable for this
purpose. Keep in mind that, while a user might consider the device
unsatisfactory if it takes too long to fill a teapot, a device that can
neutralize the acidity from an excessively large flow might take up so much
room as to be inconvenient, or be too expensive to be competitive in the
marketplace.
Other factors that must be considered include ability to withstand water
pressure (domestic water supplies commonly operate at around 40 psi), and to be
able to pass the required water flows without excessive pressure drop (assume
that a loss of up to 4 psi is acceptable). The device should not leak. Cost and
maintainability are, of course, essential to consider as well.
***** Exercises and Design Activities *****
**** First Lab (Week #2): ****
To verify that a water source is acidic, and to verify that a neutralization
scheme is actually working, it is necessary to have a sensor that measures the
pH of water. Building and demonstrating such a sensor is a task of the first
lab. You will have access to pH electrodes, Proto-Boards, and various parts, as
well as directions to assemble a circuit that can display the electrode's
output voltage. We will have standard calibration solutions (pH buffers) at pH
4, 7, and 10 available to calibrate your sensor. (To verify pressure behavior,
you will ultimately need to install pressure sensors as well-these will be
mechanical gages and they will serve to measure the pressure drop (head loss)
incurred by your device.) There will also be a series of exercises in pH
control, with which to both demonstrate the sensor and renew your acquaintance
with acid-base chemistry. (PDF)

**** Second Lab (Week #3): ****
The focus of this week will be dissolution rates. Specifically, if dissolution
of solid limestone is chosen as the means of water neutralization, it will be
necessary to assure that the rate of dissolution will sufficient to neutralize
all water even under worst-case conditions. If you are designing a treatment
column, this corresponds to fastest water flow.
To arrive at a detailed design for a treatment column (most people will opt for
a column, though this is not required) it is necessary to relate dissolution
rates to the other parameters of your design. Such parameters include column
length, area, and packing material. Thus, we will conduct a series of exercises
leading to the production of design curves for limestone sands of various grain
sizes. At this time you and your team should also be determining how to make
sure that your device meets requirements for withstanding water pressure, not
leaking, and being straightforward to build. (PDF)
**** Third Lab (Week #4): ****
This set of laboratory exercises will include measurement of the hydraulic
properties of sand columns, providing data that will permit you to determine
the pressure loss as a function of flow in any given treatment column. (PDF)
**** Fourth and Fifth Labs (Weeks #5 and #6): ****
These lab periods are for detailed design, prototyping, and testing of your
projects. 'Open shop' hours, outside of regular class time, will supplement in-
class time for the construction and testing of prototypes.
Although it is likely that most or all of the class will choose to build
treatment columns for this project, other solutions that are conceptually quite
different are also possible. A variety of materials will be available-these
include limestone sand in various grain sizes, and pipe from which columns of
various sizes can be made. Instructors should be consulted if a team wishes to
follow an approach that requires materials not available in the lab.
***** Evaluation *****
The project will be evaluated both on the process by which it is created, and
on its performance. The former will be assessed through instructor observations
of participation and reading of notebook. The latter will be assessed by in-
class demonstrations of your project.
