TO: 1.101 Class 
RE: Information about Water Treatment Project Demonstration and Evaluation 
DATE: Oct 10, 2005 
 
 
1. SCHEDULE 
 
Completion of the water treatment projects is scheduled for this week, for both lab 
 
sections. Because of the Oct 11 class holiday, the only meeting of 1.101 this week will be 
during the lab periods, Wed. Oct. 12/Thurs Oct 13. 
 
We will have demonstrations of projects during approximately the last half of 
 
each period. For demonstration, each treatment device will be operated at its design flow 
rate for a period of time equal to at least hydraulic two residence times, or until outflow is 
clear, whichever is longer. During this time, flow and differential pressure will be 
recorded. At the end of this period of time, a sample will be collected for pH 
measurement (the instructors will have a pH meter).  
 
Notebooks will be collected for review at the end of the lab period. Project 
 
reports will due at the beginning of the lab period for following week; at this time, 
notebooks will be returned for use in the first structural exercise. 
 
 
2. PROJECT REPORTS 
 
A specific format is not prescribed for this project report. However, it is suggested 
 
that reports be organized with sections that provide: i. a statement of the problem, 
including a brief background discussion, and performance requirements (such as, in this 
case, target pH and flow values), ii. information on conceptual design and principles of 
operation, iii. the detailed design, including drawings with dimensions, information on 
materials, etc (enough info so someone having reasonable shop skills could build one), iv. 
test results, and v. a concluding section in which the adequacy of the design, and any 
suggestions for further work, are given. This would include a clear description of what a 
second version of your filter would look like, and consideration of other aspects of the 
design, such as how to make the design simple for manufacture, easy to install, and 
readily maintained. 
 
 
Reports should be provided as paper copy. There is not a prescribed length, but 
remember that there is great virtue in brevity and clarity. It is much more difficult to 
write a clear and concise, but complete, document than a verbose one. However, the 
ability to do this is a very valuable skill. If you start running over a few pages for this 
project report, it may be a warning sign
