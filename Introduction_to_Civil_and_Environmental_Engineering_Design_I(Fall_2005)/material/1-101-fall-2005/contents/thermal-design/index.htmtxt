Thermal design concerns the maintenance of proper temperature, typically within
a building, structure, vehicle, or device. We will focus on a convenient and
important example, that of buildings such as on the MIT campus. Our emphasis
will be that of energy usage due to wintertime space heating; treatments of
summertime cooling are in many ways similar.
This unit has the following objectives:
    * To understand basic principles governing heat flow.
    * To learn some types of wall and window construction typical of
      residential and light commercial building construction as they relate to
      heat (and also moisture) flow.
    * To understand the basic principles of thermography, the operation of a
      thermal infrared camera, and the use of thermal IR imaging in evaluating
      building heat loss.
    * To conduct an engineering study of the thermal performance of an MIT
      building.
There will be one in-lab practical exercise and an engineering report:
1. We will carry out a practical laboratory exercise in which we determine the
heat flow characteristics of several types of construction. (PDF)
2. Each team will conduct and report on a Heat Loss Study of an MIT building or
part thereof. (PDF)
                         Thermal design information.
