1.101 Introduction to Civil and Environmental Engineering Design 
Fall, 2005 
Design Project 3-Thermal Design 
Laboratory Exercise  
 
Purpose:  In this exercise, teams will cooperate in the construction of six lab-scale 
`houses’, each built with a different standard construction technique, including: 
 
 

Conventional Frame construction, uninsulated 
Conventional Frame construction, with fiberglass batting insulation and interior 
drywall 
Conventional Frame construction, layered reflective foil insulation and interior 
drywall 
Frame construction with window 
Single-width brick construction 
 
Hollow-core masonry unit (‘cement block’) construction 
 
 
 
Each unit will be tested to i) illustrate the nature of heat flow through a wall, ii) determine 
an overall heat loss coefficient, iii) provide a target for use of thermal infrared imagery to 
remotely determine interior wall construction, possible defects, and absolute temperature 
 
Procedure: 
1) Each team or consortium of teams will construct a 3 ft by 3 ft by 3 ft ‘house’ structure 
at a location specified in the laboratory. 
2) Each structure will be heated to an interior temperature approximately 50 degrees F 
above ambient laboratory temperature by an electric heater equipped with a watt-hour 
meter to measure total energy input. 
3) After steady state is reached, teams will measure total power required to heat the 
structure, and skin temperature of both inside and outside surfaces. Teams will also 
obtain thermograms using an infrared camera. 
4) The data will be used to determine the effective R value of the construction, and the R 
value associated with air films both inside and outside. This will be compared with 
calculations carried out using standard, published parameters. 
5) The infrared imagery will be used for: a. practice with the cameras and software, b. 
evaluation of the internal structure of the walls of the model `houses`, including defects, 
thermal short circuits, and other leaks, and c. comparison of inferred wall surface skin 
temperature with actual contact measurements, to assess the ability of the infrared 
cameras to estimate absolute temperatures 
 
Data and interpretation are to be reported by each team in the form of a lab exercise on 
the following form. Data will also be pooled and made available for the entire class. 
 
 
 
 
 

Thermal analysis of your structure. 
 
Details of wall construction: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use tabulated thermal data for the various types of construction to estimate the effective 
R value of the walls. Note that if the walls are very heterogeneous you will need to 
calculate an R for each different type of wall. Assume a ‘still air’ boundary on both inside 
and outside. Show the calculations here, and clearly indicate the resulting R values: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Calculate the predicted heat loss from your structure, in both BTU/hr and in watts, for a 
temperature difference of 50 degrees F. Be clear about the areas that you are invoking 
when you make the calcuations. Use an average of inside and outside wall areas to 
account for corners.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Predict the difference between outside temperature and the skin temperature of the 
outside of the structure once steady state has been reached. How does this compare with 
actual measured temperatures as determined i. by a contact thermometer, and ii. by 
remote infrared imagery? What percentage of the total heat loss do you figure is lost by 
radiation? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note here any conclusions that you may draw from thermal imagery concerning the 
thermal performance of the structure you helped to build. Specifically note any issues 
related to workmanship or to materials performance that have a bearing on overall 
thermal performance. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on data obtained by the whole class, rank the thermal performance of the different 
wall types. Do you have any conclusions that would be relevant for architects and 
builders who are interested in creating ‘sustainable’ buildings?
