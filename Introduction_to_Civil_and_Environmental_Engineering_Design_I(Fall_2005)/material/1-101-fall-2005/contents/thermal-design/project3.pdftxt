1.101 Introduction to Civil and Environmental Engineering Design 
Fall, 2005 
Project 3-Thermal Design  
Engineering study of heat loss performance of an MIT building 
 
Purpose:  
 
To prepare an engineering report on the thermal performance of an MIT building (or a 
designated portion thereof). The report will be based on both calculations and field 
measurements, and should provide 1) an estimate of current overall thermal performance, 
2) identification of any notable deficiencies identified in the study, and 3) suggested 
actions to remediate the deficiencies.   
 
Procedure: 
 
 
Teams will be the same as those constituted for the in-lab thermal experiments 
during the week of Dec 6. Each team will choose a subject structure, normally a portion 
of a building on the MIT campus for which wall and window construction information 
can be found. 
 
 
Teams will analyze the thermal performance of the structure using heat loss 
calculations, and also using infrared measurements. In addition, specific possible defects 
are to be identified using thermal imagery. 
 
Calculations will include estimation of R values for each exposed wall and 
 
window, which may be done on the basis of published data and, potentially, data from the 
heat loss experiments we will be doing in the lab. Total areas of each type of exposed 
surface need to be determined. Results should be reported as rate of heat loss during the 
specific day that you take thermal IR images (see below), as well as total energy loss 
during a 6000 degree-day heating season. Heat loss should be reported as total heat loss 
(use BTUs) for the section of building,  as well as BTUs per square foot of exposed 
surface (for the purpose of comparison among buildings). 
 
Infrared imagery should be used to:  
 
1. Estimate radiant heat flux to the outside at the time of measurement (be sure to note 
actual outdoors conditions, including air temperature and IR background temperature) 
 
2. Estimate skin temperature of building at the time of measurement; this should be 
compared with both the calculated value and, if the wall is accessible from the ground, 
with direct measurement (no climbing up walls or leaning out windows is permitted!). 
From these values of skin temperature, estimate heat loss at the time of measurement 
(you could use an R of 0.17 [BTU/ft2-hr]-1 for this purpose) and compare with 
calculations based on wall construction and total R values of the wall. 
 
3. Using patterns that may be observable in the IR imagery, make any relevant 
observations concerning possible wall defects and heat loss hotspots. 

 
Report 
 
The report should be clear and professional in appearance, and include: 
 
Statement of purpose of the report (enough so that someone unfamiliar with this 
assignment could pick it up and know what the study is about) 
 
Identification of the structure, and description of available data. Appendices are good 
places to put diagrams, tables, etc, 
 
Summary of methods used. 
 
Findings 
 
Recommendations 
 
Assignment Due Date 
 
Each team will turn in their report on or before Dec 14, 2005, and also present an approx. 
10 minute oral summary to the class during the last week of classes. The exact schedule 
of oral presentations will be announced.
