Class Exercise #1 
1.101 Structures Work 

The figure shows a truss structure. Draw a single free body diagram which, in applying the requirements of static 
equilibrium, will enable you to determine the forces in members DE, AE, and AB in terms of the suspended weight W

Note: 

That FAE and FDE came out negative means that the forces act in the opposite direction to that 
which I assumed at the outset. I assumed the three members were  “in tens ion” ; the member 
forces are all shown pulling on the nodes (A and D). Hence the nodes are pulling back on the 
members so they are in tension. One student stated it this way: “I had  assumed the forces FAE 
and FDE in the wrong direction ”. No te that it is not wrong to do so, however. You can associ­
ated the sign of the unknown with the magnitude of the unknown. So don ’ t waste time trying to 
figure out the direction of an unknown internal force (or component of stress for that matter). 

The member forces are all proportional to the external load. 

The forces in the horizontal, top and bottom members AB and DE are significantly bigger than 
the force in the diagonal member AE (for b/h of order 1). If b =2h ( θ
 = 45o) we have: 
FAB   =  10 ⋅  W 
FA E   =  – 1.4 ⋅  W 
FDE   =  – 9 ⋅  W
