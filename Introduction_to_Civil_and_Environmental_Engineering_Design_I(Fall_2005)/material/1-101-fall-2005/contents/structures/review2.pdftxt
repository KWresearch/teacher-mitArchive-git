Design Review - More Information

At tomorrow’ s 10 minute design review, in addition to showing a sketch of your structure, you are expected 
•	

to have considered the possibility of failure due to the uniaxial stress in a member exceeding a strength 
(yield) criterion - including a healthy factor of safety (e.g., 2.0) 
to have considered the possibility of failure due to buckling of any member subject to a compressive load. 
For this estimate a buckling load using the result we derived for a beam simply-supported at both ends and/ 
or using the result you obtained in last weeks test of a simple truss. 
to have considered the possibility of the vertical deﬂection  at any point exceeding the limit prescribed in the 
speciﬁcations. F or this, a rough estimate based upon modeling the truss as a beam with an “I” computed as 
that due to two equal areas separated by a distance equal to the overall depth of the truss will sufﬁce.  Use of 
Trussworks will also sufﬁce. 
•	 Cost should also be estimated.  The way the costs were deﬁned, i.e., 
 

The cost of the steel stock per unit of length is proportional to the cross-sec­
tional area. The unit cost of a spot welded joint is one tenth (1/10) the cost of 
a length L (the span length) of the heaviest stock. 

means that you can only estimate relative costs, of one design compared to another. You can check the sensitivity of 
cost of your design to a single change - for example, due to a change in member area. To ground your estimates, you 
might arbitrarily assign a cost per unit length to, say the heaviest stock - e.g., 10 lira, or 1 dollar, whatever. 

NB: With regard to the use of Trussworks: To remain in control, its best that you do a much as you can “by hand”, 
then turn to the computer to do the matrix analysis. This means you best start with a equilibrium determinant design.
