1.101 Structures Lab. 
Fall 2005 
Week 4 - Design Review Requirements 

Next Tuesday, 8 November you will describe your design, as it stands at that moment. Again we 
will split the class into three sets of groups. Each group will have approximately 10 minutes on 
stage. Considering the short time that you have, it would be best if but one person speak for the 
whole group. 

You are to hand in at the beginning of the session a one page summary. It will include 

	 a sketch showing the overall configuration of the structure with dimensions; 
	 member cross-section dimensions should be defined; 
you are to provide justification, as crude as it may be, for your choice of all design 
parameters - truss height, section dimensions, number and layout of members - tak­
ing account of possible failure modes due to excessive displacement, yielding, or 
buckling. 

This may not be your final design; you still have time to make significant changes this week and 
even next.
