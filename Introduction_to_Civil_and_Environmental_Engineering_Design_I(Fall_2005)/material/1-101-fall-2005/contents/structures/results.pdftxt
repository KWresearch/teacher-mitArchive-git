    Summary of Truss Tests 

Tabulation of Truss Design Parameters 
The table shows, for each group, whether MIG or SPOT welding was used (column 2); the total cost 
of the structure as tested (column 3); the weight of the structure (column 4); the strength, as mea-
sured by the load at which significant departure from linearity was observed - a value generally sig-
nificantly less than the load at which the structure collapsed (column 5); and the ratio of strength to 
weight (column 6).

Note: 
•  Mig welding compared to spot welding added significantly to the weight of the struc-
ture. 
•  The strength to weight ratios are all large relative to 1.0.  This explains why one is 
often justified in neglecting the weight of the structure itself with respect to the 
applied loading. 
•  The three structures that failed at an applied load less than the prescribed 40 pounds 
showed relatively low cost indicating that more material, correctly positioned, might 
have rendered these three designs acceptable. 
•  The design, among those that supported 40 pounds, with the lowest total cost 
showed the second highest strength and the highest  strength to weight ratio. If this 
were a competition, T5 would take the cake.
