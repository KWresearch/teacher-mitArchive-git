Class Exercise #2     
1.101 Structures Work 

The figure shows a simply supported beam. 

“Si mply supported”  means the same thing as 
“p inned ”  - i.e., a support that can not resist rotation 
of the beam. Hence the internal bending moment at a 
pinned support must vanish. 

From symmetry, the reaction force at the left end 
must equal the reaction force at the right end. Both 
are directed upwards when viewing an isolation of 
the beam alone. This assures moment equilibrium of 
the isolated beam. 

For force equilibrium, the two reactions must sum to 
the two applied forces. Hence each is equal to F.

The free-body diagram shows the internal shear force, Qz, and the 
internal bending moment My, acting at a distance x to the right of the 
centerline but to the left of the point of application of the load on the 
right. I have assumed the internal force and moment positive in 
accord with the convention used in 1.050. (The insert, upper left, 
summarizes the convention. Note how the positive sense of either 
variable, either up or down, depends on the direction of the outward 
normal of the section you are considering. You can interpret this to 
the equality of equal and opposite reactions at a section of the 
beam).

From the first of these we have Qz =0. So the second gives My = -aF. 
Note how the variable distance x does not appear in our expression 
for the internal bending moment. As long as x is less than (L/2 -a) 
and > -(L/2 -a) the bending moment will be this constant value. We 
know this to be the case whenever the shear force, Qz, is zero, which 
it is in this midspan region. 

The figure at the left, taken from the Lab #2 handout, Appendix A, 
shows how the shear force and bending moment vary over the full 
span. Note how the moment vanishes at the pinned supports.
