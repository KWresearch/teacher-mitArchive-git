1.101 Introduction to Civil and Environmental Engineering Design I  

Structure Design Task 

Your task is to design, fabricate and test a simply-supported truss, which will support a prescribed load with­
out failure. Also, the vertical deflection of any node is not to exceed a prescribed value. The figure is meant 
only to introduce overall geometry of the structure. More detailed specifications are given below.

	 The length of span is prescribed as L =3 ft.+/- 0.5inches 
	 The structure is required to support, at mid span, a static load of 40 pounds. 
	 Maximum deflection at any node is not to exceed 0.1 inches. 

Other constraints include: 

	 Your choice of bar stock, out of which you are to fabricate members, is limited to three steel 

sections: one with a rectangular cross-section of 1/8 in. by 1/16 in., a second with cross-sec­ 

tion of 1/4 in. by 1/16 in and third with cross-section measuring 1/4 in. by 1/8 in.  

	 All joints are to be spot welded. 
	 Material and fabrication costs are to be kept to a minimum. The cost of the steel stock per unit 
of length is proportional to the cross-sectional area. The unit cost of a spot welded joint is one 
tenth (1/10) the cost of a length L (the span length) of the heaviest stock. 

A dial gage indicator will be used to measure joint displacement and you will be supplied with the necessary 
equipment to support and load the structure.
