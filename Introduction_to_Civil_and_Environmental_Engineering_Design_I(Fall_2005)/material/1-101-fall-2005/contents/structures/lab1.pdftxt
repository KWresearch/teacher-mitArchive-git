1.101 Structures Lab. 
Fall 2005 
Week 1 - The Tension Test 

Our objective is to measure the Elastic Modulus of steel. This we do in two ways. 

First, we will subject a specimen in the form of a steel rod to a tension using an Instron testing 
machine designed specifically for that purpose. An “extensonmeter” will be used to obtain a mea­
sure of strain and a “load cell” used to obtain a measure of stress. 

In the second par t of the experiment. you will do a tension test of a steel member, loading the spec­
imen using the dead weights available in the lab but measuring uniaxial deformation using strain 
gages. 

You will use the pages that follow in reporting your results. 

Wk 1.1 Instron Tension Test of steel. 

The INSTRON machine is built specifically to sub­
ject structural elements to tension or compression. 
The figure at the right indicates how it works. 

A double acting piston drives the table up, or down, 
when pressurized hydraulically. The test specimen 
is fixed relative to the top bar and the shaded cross 
bar by the grips; the shaded cross bar is fixed in 
space. Hence, the specimen  is subject to a tensile 
load as the table moves downward. 

Test Sequence - Overview 

Before the test, you will measure and record the 
diameter of the test specimen. 

Steve Rudolph will set up the apparatus, fixing the 
specimen in the grips of the machine, attaching the 
extensonmeter, and setting the Instron for a “ramp” 
increase of load.

The output of the extensonmeter and the load cell will be automatically recorded on a pc. You are to 
make note of the load and displacement factors so that you can conve rt the voltage readings so 
recorded to force (then stress) and displacement (then strain). The original length between the 
points of attachment of the extensonmeter should also be noted. 

The specimen will be loaded to failure.

Parameters for determining tensile stress. 

The  load is sensed by a load cell integral with the top bar. It puts out a voltage propo rtional to the 
load. For our purposes, you need know the scaling factor for conve rting this voltage to a (tensile) 
force. This is obtained from a “full scale” setting, the “automatic calibration” of the load cell. 

At full scale, the signal output is ______ Volts 

and the corresponding load is _______ KN or ___________ Kips1.

The load factor is then: 

Load factor = 

KN/volt 

or  = 

Kips/volt 

Knowing the cross-sectional area of the test specimen, we can, knowing the load, compute the ten­
sile stress in the bar. We record that the diameter of the specimen as: 

Diameter = 

+/- ? mm 

or =   ___________________+/- ? 

in. 

So the cross sectional area is 

Area  =

mm2  or 

 _____________________  in2 

The bar, made of ___________steel, has a 

  yield stress  of  ______ 

 ksi.

 and  an ultimate stress of   ________  ksi 
 

Our goal is to graph how the tensile stress varies with the tensile strain. We need, then to go one 
step fur ther and construct the factor for tensile stress in terms of voltage. Dividing the force by the 
area we obtain: 

Stress factor = 

Pascals/volt 

or  = 

psi/volt 

To compute the corresponding values of the strain, we need to measure the change in length of the 
specimen. The strain is the ratio of the change in length to the original length. 

Parameters for determining tensile strain. 

An extensonmeter will be used to measure the change in length between two points located on the 
surface of the cylindrical specimen. The two knife edges, which are held in place against the speci­
men by simple elastic bands, are initially spaced a preset distance apart. This “gage length” is 

Gage Length  =

 in 

   

or 

mm 

The gage factor is determined from “full scale” conditions. The extensonmeter we will use can 
accommodate a full scale displacement of ________ inches. The full scale output voltage is 
________volts. Hence, the scale factor for displacement is 

Displacement factor  = 

in/volt   or
  

 mm/volt 

The strain factor is then, dividing by the gage length 

Strain  factor  = 

(in/in)/volt    or 

(mm/mm)/volt

Data will be recorded via the computer (equipped with analogue to digital conversion hardware). An 
ASCI text file will be produced in three column format.

(volts) 

The first dozen or so readings will show negative values for the displacement and load as the spec­
imen “takes up the load”. Do not include these on your plot. The “good” data will be taken at a rela­
tively high frequency so you should select a subset, or use an averaging, “smoothing” of the data 
before plotting by hand or using a spread sheet. Also, your plot should end well before breaking of 
the specimen - you want to show clearly the slope in the linear region of the stress-strain plot - so 
you will “truncate” the data set at the end as well as at the beginning. You do want to plot past the 
yield point figured at a 2% offset. Also indicate the ultimate stress - as a point on the stress axis. 
Attach your plot to this repor t. 

Results 

Once we have a plot, we determine the slope in the elastic range. We obtain in this way the follow­
ing experimentally determined value for E, the elastic, orYoung’s modulus :

A graph of the stress-strain curve, ranging up to three or four times the strain at yield is shown 
below (Impor t the graph from a spread sheet or simply, include in this document as the next page). 

The slope is indicated on the graph.

Wk 1.2 Dead weight tension test of steel. 

We return to the lab and subject a thin, steel specimen of rectangular cross section to tension. We 
again measure pairs of values of applied  loading and displacement but we do not take the speci­
men to failure. We will remain in the elastic range, then unload. 

Setup of  test specimen. 

The schematic at the  right shows the test setup. The 
two steel members will already have been secured at 
their tops to the rigid space frame atop the rigid table. 
Only one of the specimens will be subjected to tension; 
the other provides a way of nulling out the effects of 
temperature variation that might imbalance the bridge. 
The  location of the four strain gages in the bridge cir­
cuit is shown in Appendix B.  There you will also see 
the how the op-amp is configured. 

The first step is to measure the cross-section dimen­
sions of the specimen.

When you first confront the protoboard, the strain gages may not have been connected to the 
board. You should do so in accord with the circuit drawn in Appendix B. 

The next step is to determine the gain of the op-amp. We do this by deliberately unbalancing the 
bridge, replacing one of the inactive gages with a resistor of suitable magnitude (Greater than the 
resistance of the strain gage, i.e., >350 ohms) in parallel with a 2 kilo-ohm potentiometer (“trim 
pot”). See Appendix B. for bridge, op-amp circuit diagram details. The figure below shows only what 
you will need to know in order to vary the input to the op-amp, then measure the output; e.g., the 
supply voltages are not shown (which you should set at +/- 6 volts).

If available, use two voltmeters to measure both the input voltage to the op-amp e1 - e2, and the out­
put voltage of the op-amp, pin 6 to ground. First, short out the input, connecting e1  and e2  using a 
shor t jumper wire. Then, adjust the 10 Kohm trim pot until the output of the op-amp is zero, i.e., 
within a few millivolts of zero. (Zero does not exist in the material world). 

Now, remove the jumper wire and set the op-amp input voltage (which you are measuring with one 
of the voltmeters) to some small value, either positive or negative, say on the order of 10 mv. 
Record this value, and the output value of the op-amp, in the table below. Repeat, increasing the 
input voltage by another 10 mv, or whatever, again measuring the corresponding op-amp output. 
Continue as you see fit, but do take values of the opposite sign as well. Make sure you enter an esti­
mate of uncer tainty in your readings in the row indicated at the top of the table (+/-??).

 When you are finished estimating the gain, disconnect the 2 kilo-ohm trim pot and replace the 
resistor R’ with the (in-active) strain gage you had removed from the bridge at the outset.

The tension test 

With all four gages now connected in the bridge circuit, adjust the 10 kohm pot to bring the output to 
zero, within a few millivolts. Note: if you measure the input you will find that it is not zero; there is a 
slight imbalance - slight in the sense of tolerable - in the bridge due to variability in gage resistance. 
They are not identically 350 ohms. This imbalance, a dc offset,  is amplified by the op-amp but you 
should be able to null it out by the zero adjust on the op-amp, the 10k pot. If this does not seem pos­
sible, call for an instructor. Make sure you record the positive (and negative) supply voltage. 

Attach the chain to the bottom of the specimen subject to  loading, using an S hook. Attach the pail 
to the other end of the chain hanging below the test bed again using an S hook. Make sure the 
chain passes through the appropriate slot in the test bed to avoid contact with the bed. 

The bottom of the pail should hang but a half inch off floor. Although the experiment should not 
take the specimen to failure, we want to make sure that, if failure did occur, the bucket would not 
drag the specimen and strain gauges through the slots in the table. 

Record the output voltage of the op-amp with the empty bucket and chain in place. We will take this 
as our zero  loading condition. (Alternatively, we could weigh the bucket and chain as our first load 
point, but since we are only interested in the slope of the stress/strain plot, and since that relation­
ship is linear for small strains, it matters not  if we work from an initial offset.) 

Put on your safety glasses!! 

Load with the dead weights provided, carefully placing one after another in the bucket. Do 
not exceed 40 pounds. Take data upon unloading as well.

Column 3, the bridge “output” voltage e1-e2 - which is “input” to the op-amp - is obtained by 
dividing the op-amp output by the op-amp gain, G. 

Columns 4, the fractional change in gage resistance due to strain, is obtained from the analysis of 
the bridge circuit, assuming the fractional change  is small, i.e., e1 - e2 = (Vsupply /2)(∆R/Rg) 
The strain, column 5, is related to the fractional change in resistance by ε = (1/Fgage)(∆R/Rg) 
where Fgage  is the “gage factor” stated by the manufacturer1 to beFgage = 2.07 +/- 0.5%

curve obtained from the  instron test on the same plot.

The tension test.

The tension test is a standard test1for characterizing 
the behavior of a material under uniaxial load and for 
determining the elastic modulus, E. The test consists 
of pulling on a circular shaft, nominally a centimeter 
in diameter, and measuring the applied force and the 
relative displacement of two points on the surface of 
the shaft in-line with its axis. As the load P increases  Lo 
from zero on up until the specimen breaks, the rela­
tive distance between the two points increases from 
L0 to some final length just before separation. The 
graph at the right indicates the trace of data points 
one might obtain for load P versus  ∆ where 
∆  =  L L–  o 
If we double the cross-sectional area, A, we expect to have to double the  load to obtain the same 
change in length of the two points on the surface. That indeed is the case. Thus, we can extend our 
results obtained from a single test on a specimen of cross sectional area A and length L  to another 
0
specimen of the same length but different area if we plot the ratio of load to area, the tensile stress, 
in place of P. Similarly,  if, instead of plotting the change in length, ∆, of the two points, we plot the 
stress against the ratio of the change in length to the original length between the two points our 
results will be applicable to specimens of varying length. The ratio of change in length to original 
length is called the extensional strain. We designate the tensile stress by σ and the extensional 
strain by ε. The tensile stress is defined as
≡ P A
σ
 and the extensional strain by  ε ≡ ∆ ⁄ Lo .

The figure below left shows the results of a test of 1020, Cold Rolled Steel. Stress, σ is plotted ver­

• The behavior of the bar in this region is called elastic. Elastic means that when 
the load is removed, the bar returns to its original, undeformed configura­
tion. That is L returns to L0. There is no permanent set. 
• The relative displacements of points — the strains in the elastic region — are very 
small, generally insensible without instruments to amplify their magnitude. To “see” 
a relative displacement of two points originally 100 mm apar t when the stress is on 
the order of 400 Mega Newtons/m2 your eyes would have to be capable of resolv­
ing a relative displacement of the two points of 0.2 mm! Strains in most structural 
materials are on the order of tenths of a percent at most. 
• At some stress level, the bar does not return to its undeformed shape after 
removing the load. This stress level is called the yield strength. The yield strength 
defines the  limit of elastic behavior ; beyond the yield point the material behaves 
plastically. In the graphs above, we show the yield strength defined at a 2% offset, 
that is, as the intersection of the experimentally obtained stress-strain curve with a 
straight line of slope, E, intersecting the strain axis at a strain of 0.002. Its value is 
approximately 600 MN/m2. 
• Loading of the bar beyond the yield strength engenders very large relative dis­
placements for relatively small fu rther increments in the stress, σ.

Appendix B. - The electronics. 

The bridge circuit. 

The “Wheatstone bridge” produces an output voltage propor tional to the change in resistance of the 
active strain gages. This voltage signal, in turn, is input into an operational amplifier, which boosts 
the (dc) signal by a factor, the Gain factor. First we analyze the bridge circuit, then turn to the op­
amp. 

The two strain gages fixed to the specimen subject to loading are 
positioned diagonally opposite as shown. These two will experi­
ence an increase in resistance ∆R when the load is applied. The 
“in-active” gages attached to the specimen which simply stands 
by, unloaded, are positioned in the remaining two, diagonally 
opposed, legs of the bridge. We apply the circuit laws to deter­
mine the output voltage e1 - e2 as a function of  ∆R/R. 

Consider the current flow through the two resistors on the left side 
of the bridge. From the usual circuit laws, we have.

Note that the voltage e1 
is less than the supply voltage. We say that the circuit “divides” the (sup­
ply) voltage; the two resistors in series function as a “voltage divider”. (If ∆R is zero, the supply volt­
age is divided in two). The same kind of analysis gives, for the current flow through the two resistors 
on the right,

But the ratio ∆R/R is going to be much less than 1.0, so we neglect this ratio with respect to 2.0 in 
Vs u p p l y
the denominator and write,  e2 – e1  =  --- --- --- ( ∆ ⁄

Now the change in resistance is propor tional to the strain, that is  ∆R R =  F
ε 1  where the
⁄ 
g a g e
gage factor is approximately 2.0 So knowing the output voltage (difference) e1 - e2 we can use these 
last two equations to determine the strain, ε. (The voltage (difference) e1 - e2 
is obtained from the 
output of the op-amp, reduced by the Gain factor, i.e., e1 -e2  = (Op-amp output)/(Op-amp Gain)

ment of Materials Science, “Experimental Strain Analysis” posted on our MIT server.

The op-amp. 

We treat the op-amp as a “black box”, restricting our attention to how to configure resistance values 
in the input and feedback lines to obtain the desired relationship of output to input, in our case, a 
gain of approximately 50. 

The figure, taken from The Art of Electronics1 superim­
poses the conventional symbol for an operational amplifier, 
the triangle, on the physical form of the chip - an 8pin, 
“dual in-line package” (DIP). 

Pins 1 and 5 are where we connect the 10 kohm potenti­
ometer end terminals. The “wiper” of this trim pot is con­
nected to pin 4. This will enable nulling the output when 
the input is nil.

Pins 2 and 3 are where our differential voltage output from 
the bridge is input. The minus, -, and plus, +, signs do not 
mean that we must connect the greater of e1 and e2 to pin 
3 and the lessor to pin 2. The “inver ting” and “non inver t­
ing” labels enable one to determine the relative sign (phase) of the output to input when the op-amp 
sees a single, rather than differential, input. This relative phase is not of concern  in our case since 
we are interested only in the magnitude of the output relative to the input. 

Figure by MIT OCW.

Pin 4 is where we connect the negative supply voltage and pin 7 where we connect the positive 
supply voltage. Limits on the supply voltages are +/- 18 volts. (Use a value between +/-5 and +/-10 
volts).

Non-inverting op-amp 

As an example of a single input application, consider the “nonin­
ver ting amplifier” shown at the left.  First some rules of behavior of 
our black box. Quoting The Ar t of Electronics: 

eout 

“Here are the simple rules for working out op-amp behavior with 
external feedback. [With the output, pin 6, connected to the nega­
tive input, pin 2, usually with a resistor in the line].... 

First the op-amp voltage gain [op-amp alone] is so high that a 
fraction of a millivolt between the  input terminals will swing the 
output over its full range [limited by the supply voltage], so we 
ignore that the small voltage and state golden rule I: 

1. The output attempts to do whatever is necessary to make the voltage difference between 
the inputs zero. 

Second, op-amps draw very little input current [on the order of nano and pico amps]; we round this 
off, stating golden rule II: 

2. The inputs draw no current.” 

For the noninver ting amplifier, rule 2 means that there is no current flow from the node at the junc­
tion of R1 and R2 into the negative input terminal. This, in turns, allows us to treat the feedback and 
R 1 
resistor to ground circuit as a voltage divider between eo and ground. Thus:  e =  ----------------------- ⋅ e

“Follower” op-amp 

Note too that if we let R1 get very large (e.g., open the leg to ground) and 
let R2 get vanishingly small (sho rt circuit pin 2 to the output pin 6), then we 
have the circuit you used in the first par t of the course as a “buffer” or “fol­
lower” - an instrumentation amplifier which did not “load down” your ph sen­
sor (recall rule 2) and supplied as much current as needed at its output with 
a gain of G = 1.

The circuit diagram at the 
right shows how we will use an op-amp to obtain a 
gain of G = 50 (approximately). 

Ignore all but the input lines to pins 2 and 3 and the 
feedback line connecting pin 6 back to pin 2. 

Consider the input to pin 3. Since there is no cur­
