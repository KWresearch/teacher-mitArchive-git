Answers to Exam 1 - Fall 2009 
Problem 1:  Graded by Prof. Fonstad 
i)	 The resistivity is given, and is the inverse of the conductivity:  σ = 1/ρ = qµeno. 
a) 
Thus, no  = 1/ρqµe  = 1/(102x1.6x10-19x1.6x103) = 3.9x1013  cm -3  ≈ 4 x 1013  cm -3. 
ii)	 po  = ni
2/no  = 1020/(3.9x1013) = 2.56 x 106  cm -3. 
ih = A jh = - A q Dh dp’/dx .  Dh = µh(kT/q) = 640 x 0.025 = 640/40 = 16 cm2/s. 
i)	
Thus, ih  = -10-4x1.6x10-19x1.6x101x(-5x1014/2x10-4) = 6.4 x 10-4  A. 
ii)	 The total number is the area under the profile times the cross-sectional area: 
Excess holes = (5x1014x2x10-4/2)x10-4  = 5 x 106 
iii)	 The total recombination is the total excess divided by the minority carrier 
lifetime:  5x106/τh  = 5x106/10-4  = 5 x 1010  holes/s 
The hole recombination current, i.e. the current supplying the holes  is the total
hole recombination rate times q:  5 x 1010  x 1.6 x 10-19  = 8 x 10-9  A.  This is much 
smaller than the hole diffusion current found in 1-b-i, i.e. negligible. 
i)	 Diode B, because the saturation current varies inversely with the effective

width of the diode.  Both diodes have the same physical length, but since Lh  <

wN  in Diode B, it has the smaller effective width, and thus the larger IS.

ii)	 Diode A, because the excess hole population in it falls off linearly to zero at x = 
wN, whereas in Diode B the excess population falls off more quickly, i.e.
exponentially.  As a result there is more area under the excess carrier profile in 
Diode A, and thus more excess carriers in the n-side quasi-neutral region. 
iii)	 They are similar, because the space charge layer width does not depend on τmin. 
i)	 The thermal equilibrium minority carrier populations in the emitter, base, and 
collector are:  poE  = 2 x 102  cm -3, noB  = 103  cm -3, poC  = 2 x 103  cm -3.  When a 0.6 V 
bias is applied to the junctions, the excess minority carrier concentrations at the
edges of the space charge layer increase by 0.6/0.06 = 10 orders of magnitude, 
i.e. a factor of 1010, to:  p’(0-) = 2 x 1012  cm -3, n’(0+) = 1013  cm -3, n’(1-) = 1013  cm -3,
and p’(1+) = 2 x 1013  cm -3.  The plot of the corresponding carrier profiles is
shown in the figure at the top of the next page 
Note 1:  Some students did not use the 60 mV rule, but calculated exp(qVAB/kT) 
with kT/q = 25 mV.  In this case the increase is by a factor of e0.6/0.025  = e24  ≈ 2.65 
x 1010, instead of 1010; either answer was accepted. 
Note 2:  10 ≈ e2.3  so so using kT/q = 26 mV (i.e., the 60 mV rule) says the
increase is by a factor of e23, whereas using kT/q = 25 mV yields e24 .  The 
minority carrier population, and the diode current as well, are clearly very 
sensitive functions of temperature.  A good design doesn’t rely on either being
having a fixed, precisely known value. 

d) 

ii)	
β ≈ 1/δE  = (NDE/NAB)(Dh/De)(WB/WE) = (5x1017/1017)(40/15)(1/1) = 13.3 
iii)	 The choice is between emitter and base, and from the expression above we see
the correct choice to increase the doping of the emitter, which increases β.  We 
want to make β 100/13.3 = 7.5 times bigger, so we should increase NDE  by a 
factor of 7.5 to 3.75 x 1018  cm -3. 

Problem 2:  Graded by Prof. Palacios 
a)	
φ(-1.5 µm) = -(kT/q) ln(1017/1010) ≈  -7 x 0.06 = - 0.42 V 
φ(1.5 µm) = (kT/q) ln(1017/1010) ≈  7 x 0.06 =  0.42 V 
Δφ = φ(1.5 µm) − φ(-1.5 µm) = 0.42 – (-0.42) = 0.84 V 
ρ(x) =  160 x for -5x10-5  cm < x < 5x10-5  cm (i.e.- 0.5 µm < x < 0.5 µm), and ≈ 0 
elsewhere. 

b)	

c)  E(x) = ∫ρ(x) dx/εSi= 8x1013  (x2  – 2.5x10-9) for - 5x10-5  cm < x < 5x10-5  cm, and ≈ 0 
elsewhere.  The peak value is -2x105  V/cm at x = 0. 
E(x)  [V/cm] 

d)	 We can obtain the potential step between - 0.5 µm and 0.5 µm by integrating the 
electric field over this range.  Doing this yields:  φ(x) = -8x1013[ (x3/3) – 2.5x10-9  x]. 
Using this:  φ(-0.5µm) = -6.67 V, and φ(0.5µm) = 6.67 V, so ΔφDepl. Reg .  = 13.34 V.

using  the  60 mV  rule,  the  electrostatic potential must change by  0.06 x  log  2 Volts, 
or 0.06 x 0.3 = 0.018 V.  Δφ = 0.018 V between x = - 1.0 µm and x = - 0.5 µm, also. 

f) 

g)	

In  thermal  equilibrium,  Δφ  crossing  the  junction,  φb,  from  Part  a,  is  0.84  V.  Now 
the  total  change,  (φb-VAB),  is 0.02 + 13.34 + 0.02 = 13.38 V.  Subtracting, we  find  the 
applied voltage, VAB:  VAB  = -12.54 V 

Problem 3:  Graded by Prof. Weinstein 
a)	 B.C. @ x = 0:  n’(0) = 0.  B.C. @ x = L:  n’(L) = 0. 
b)	 We require Le  >> L, and since Le  = (Deτe)1/2, we must have τe  >> L2/De 
c)	 Crossing the plane of injection at XA, n’ must be continuous, and the sum of the 
carrier fluxes away from XA  must be M.  So, the constraint on n’ is  n’(XA-) = n’(XA+), 
and the constraint on dn’/dx is De(dn’/dx|XA- - dn’/dx|XA+) = MA. 
d)  For 0 < x < XA:  n’(x) = n’(XA) x/XA, and for XA  < x < L, n’(x) = n’(XA) (L-x)/(L-XA). 
Note:  The value of n’(XA) is most easily found after first solving Part e, see below. 

e)	 For 0 < x < XA:  Je,diff(x) = qDen’(XA)/XA; for XA  < x < L, Je,diff(x) = - qDen’(XA)/(L-XA). 
The current step at x = XA  must be qMA.  Using this gives n’(XA) = M XA(L-XA)/DeL; 
thus:  Je,diff(x) = qMA(L-XA)/L for 0 < x < XA, and Je,diff(x) = qMAXA/L for XA  < x < L.

current must be negligible compared to the majority carrier drift current because in
low level injection the majority carriers far outnumber the minority carriers. 
g)	 Superposition is valid, so the excess minority carrier populations and the minority
carrier drift currents due to each excitation, MAδ(XA) and MBδ(XB), individually can 
be superimposed, i.e. added: 
n’(x, gL  = MAδ(XA) + MBδ(XB)) = n’(x, gL  = MAδ(XA)) + n’(x, gL  = MBδ(XB)) 
Je,diff(x, gL  = MAδ(XA) + MBδ(XB)) = Je,diff(x, gL  = MAδ(XA)) + Je,diff(x, gL  = MBδ(XB))
