Problem 1:  Graded by Prof. Palacios 
In the steady state the low level injection, zero current continuity equation 
i)	
a) 
reduces to n’/τmin  = gL.  Thus τmin  = n’/gL. = 1014/1020  = 10-6  s = 1 µs. 
ii)	 p = po + p’ and n = no + n’; and po = 1017  cm -3 and no = ni
2/po = 103 cm -3.  With n’ 
= p’ = 1014  cm -3, we have p ≈ po  = 1017  cm -3  and n ≈ n’ = 1014  cm -3. 
iii)	 After the excitation is extinguished the excess minority carrier population
(actually both excesses, of course) decays as n’(t) = n’(0)exp(-t/τmin), which is 
the homogeneous solution of the low level continuity equation.  In the present 
case this means n’(t) = 1014exp(-t/τmin) cm-3. 
Faster, because the contact introduces an interface at which any excess minority
carrier encountering it recombines immediately, so the overall recombination
in the solid increases and thus the rate of decay must also increase.  Because the 
sample is small, and the bulk lifetime is relatively large, it can be assumed that
the increase will not be negligibly small. 
i)	 VFB  = φp – φm =  - 0.36 - 0.30  = - 0.66 V 

iv)	

b) 

ii)  VFB  = φp – φm  – Qox/Cox *= - 0.66  - 2x10-8  (3x10-6/3.5x10-13) = - 0.66 - 0.17 = - 0.83 V

c)	 The built-in potential is determined by the doping levels on either side of the

junction so we first determine NDn  from φb  and NAp.  From NAp  we find that φp =

0.42 V, which in turn tells us that φn  must equal 0.36 V to make φb  0.78 V.  This 
immediately tells us NDn  = 1016  cm -3. 
Next, wn  must be adjusted to get the desired current.  One way to do this is to first 
calculate the electron current density at the specified bias (0.4 V ≈ 7 x 60 mV):  Je = 
(qni
2De/NApwp)107  = (1.6x10-19  1020  4x101  107)/(1017  10-4) = 0.64 mA/cm2.  Thus Jh  = 
0.36 mA/cm2, which in turn says wn  =  (qni
2Dh/NDnJh)107  = (1.6x10-19  1020  1.5x101 
107)/(1016  3.6x10-4) = 0.67x10-3  cm = 6.7 µm.  (Note:  Depending on the approxi-
mations made, slightly different values can be obtained; all were accepted.) 
Problem 2:  Graded by Prof. Fonstad 
JElectron-B  = q De  dn’/dx = 1.6x10-19  4x101  [(0 - 1013)/(5x10-4  – 3x10-4)] 
i) 
a) 
= - 3.2 x 10-1  A/cm2 
JHole-B  = - q Dh  dp’/dx = 1.6x10-19  1.5x101  [(1014  – 5x1014)/(3x10-4  – 2x10-4)]

=  9.6 A/cm2

iii)	
I3  = - A (JElectron-B  + JHole-B) = - 10-4  [9.6 – (- 0.32)] = 9.28x10-4  A ≈ 0.93 mA 
iv)	 The excess minority population at the edge of a depletion region at a junction
varies as ni
2/NNet, so if the excess population is 10 times lower in Region 3 than
in Region 2, the doping level there must be 10 times larger than it is in Region 
2.  Thus, n’(3+) = 0.1 p’(3−) implies NA3  = 10 ND2  = 1018  cm -3 
i)	 The  excess minority  population  at  the  edge  of  a  depletion  region  at  a  junction
varies as ni
2/NNet,  so  if  the doping  is 10  times lower  in Region 1 than  in Region
2,  the  excess population  there  (at x = 2-) will be  10  times  larger  than  it  is at x = 
2+.  Thus, ND2  = 10 NA1  implies n’(2−) = 10 p’(2+) = 5 x 1015  cm -3. 
[Note:  This  turns  out  to  be  high  level  injection,  which  is  an  oversight  on  our
part  because  we  did  not  intend  to  have  you  worry  about  high  level  injection.
Fortunately no one even noticed, much less got hung up on it!] 
ii)	 The  thermal  equilibrium  hole  concentration  in  Region  2  is  1020/1017  =  103  cm -3. 
The population at x = 2+ has  therefore  increased  to 5 x  1014  cm -3,  a  factor  of  5 x 
1011, which is eqV12/kT.  With  this,  and using  the  60 mV  rule, we estimate  that V12 
is 60 log10  (5x1011) = 60 (11 + log10  5)  ≈ 60 x 11.7 ≈ 0.7 V. 
[Sorry  about  the  log10  5  in  this  problem,  but  any  good  engineer  should  know 
log10  5  ,  or  log10  2,  anyway.  The  first  is  0.7,  and  the  second  is  0.3.  Notice  that 
they add to 1 because 5 x 2 = 10, so you really only need to know one of them.] 
i)	 Terminal  3  because  Region  3  is  the  most  heavily  doped,  and  would  function
well as the emitter in a pnp BJT because NA3  > ND2. 
ii)	 The profiles indicate there is little recombination in the base ( ≈ 0) so we can use 
βF  = (1  - δB)/(δE +  δB)  ≈  1/δE. 
δE  = DhNA2w2/DeNA3w3  ≈  0.133.  If we  use  βF  ≈ 
1/δE, we find βF  ≈ 7.5. 

b) 

c) 

Problem 3:  Graded by Prof. Antoniadis

a)  φn+  = 0.55 V and φp  = -0.42 V, so  Δφ13  = 0.97 V.

b)


c) 

d) 

e)	 We use the condition that the two voltage drops must add up to the built-in 
potential.  The equation is:  Δφ13  = qNA3xDL/εSi  + qNA3xD
2/2εSi 
Since the dielectric constant is the same in all parts of this structure, the
capacitance is simply that of a capacitor (L+xD) wide:  Cdp * = εSi/(L+xD).
