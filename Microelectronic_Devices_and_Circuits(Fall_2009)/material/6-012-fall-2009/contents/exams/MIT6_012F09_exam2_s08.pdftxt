Notes: 

1.  An effort has been made to make the various parts of these problems independent of
each other so if you have difficulty with one item go on, and come back later. 
2.	 Some  questions  ask  for  an  explanation  of  your  answer.  No  credit will  be  given  for 
answers lacking this explanation. 
3.	 Unless otherwise  indicated,  you  should  assume  room  temperature  and  that kT/q  is
0.025 V.  You should also approximate [(kT/q) ln 10] as 0.06 V. 
4.  Closed book; one sheet (2 pages) of notes permitted.  Formula sheet provided. 
5.  All  of  your  answers  and  any  relevant  work  must  appear  on  these  pages.  Any 
additional paper you hand in will not be graded. 
6.  Make  reasonable  approximations  and	 assumptions.  State  and  justify  any  such 
assumptions and approximations you do make. 
7.  Be careful to include the correct units with your answers when appropriate. 
8.  Be  certain  that  you  have  all  ten  (10)  pages of  this  exam  booklet  and  the  six  (6)  page
formula  sheet,  and make  certain  that you write your name  at  the  top  of  this page  in
the space provided.

Problem 1 - (34 points) 
A collection of independent short questions in two groupings. 
(a)	 You  are  in  charge  of  a  CMOS  fabrication  line  and  you  have  a  problem  because  the
thresholds of your n- and p-channel MOSFETs, which are supposed to be +1 V and 
-1 V,  respectively,  are  turning out  to  be  +3 V  and  +1 V,  instead.  You  suspect  that
the  interface  between  the  silicon  and  the  20  nm  thick  oxide  is  contaminated  with 
ions. 
(i)	 [4 pts]  What  type  of  device  is  each  transistor,  enhancement mode  (no  channel 
when vGS  = 0) or depletion mode (strongly  inverted when vGS  = 0)?  Explain your 
answers. 
n-channel MOSFET: 
because: 

Enhancement mode 

Depletion mode ; 

p-channel MOSFET: 
because: 

Depletion mode; 

Enhancement mode 

(ii)	 [4 pts]  If  you  are  right  about  the  ions  being  the  problem,  what  sign must  they
have, positive or negative.  Explain your answer. 
Ion polarity: 
Negative 
Positive; 
because: 

(iii)  [4  pts]  You  are  able  to  reduce  the  ion  problem  sufficiently  to  have  the 
thresholds  now  be  1.5  V  for  the  n-channel  device  and  - 0.5  V  for  the  p-channel. 
What  impact,  if  any,  does  this  remaining  threshold  asymmetry  have  on  an
inverter  with  respect  to  the  current  charging  the  output  node,  changing  it  from
low  to  high, when  the  input  goes  from  high  to  low,  compared  to  the  ideal  case?
Assume VDD  = 3 V.  Explain.

it is similar 

because:

Problem 1 continued 
(iv)  [4  pts]  You  are  eventually  able  to  solve  the  threshold  asymmetry  problem  so
that the thresholds have the same magnitude, but to do so you had  to double the
oxide  thickness  of  all  MOSFETs  (no  other  dimensions  were  changed).  What 
impact,  if  any, does  this  thicker  oxide have on  the magnitudes of  the  thresholds,
relative to the original design?  Explain.

smaller;

(b)  These questions concern the low frequency linear equivalent circuits of MOSFETs. 
[6 pts]  Consider  the  n-channel  MOSFET  circuit

(i)	
pictured  to the right.  The circuit is biased with VAC

= 2 Volts.  The MOSFET has following parameters:

K = 2 mA/V2

VT  = 1 V

α = 1

λ = 0.01 V-1

η = 0.2

A  small  signal  voltage,  vac(t),  is  added  to  the  2  V

bias  so now vAC(t) = 2 V +  vac(t).  First  find  the bias

and  small  signal  values  of  vGS,  vDS,  and  vBS,  and

then  draw  a  single  element  small  signal  linear

equivalent  circuit  for  this  connection  and  give  an

expression for this element in terms of gm  and go.

(ii) [3 pts]  Consider  two  MOSFETs,  one  an  n-channel  MOSFET  and  the  other  a  p-
channel  MOSFET.  They  have  identical  dimensions,  and  both  are  biased  in 
saturation at the same drain current, |ID|.  Which of  the devices, if either, would 
have the larger transconductance, gm, and why?

[6  pts]  An  n-channel  MOSFET  in  a  circuit  was mistakenly  biased  in  its  linear 
region.  Derive  expressions  in  terms  of  VGS,  VDS,  and  K  for  its  transconductance, 
gm,  and  output conductance,  go,  in  this  situation.  Assume vBS  = 0 and α = 1,  and 
ignore the Early effect, i.e., assume λ = 0.

Problem 2 - (32 points) 
The ID-VDS  plot for an ideal n-channel MOSFET (α=1) is shown below.  The substrate 
bias, VBS,  is 0 V, the saturation current, IDsat, is 10 mA, and the saturation voltage, VDS,sat,
is 5 V.  For this device tox=10 nm, εox= 3.5 x 10-13  F/cm, W= 50 µm, and L=10 µm.

(b) [5  pts]  What  is  the  slope, diD/dvDS  of  the  characteristic  at VDS  =  0V?  Make  sure  you 
provide  a  formula  as  well  as  a  value  so  that  your  answer  is  independent  of  the 
correctness of your Part (a).

(c)  [8  pts]  Since  α=1  you  can  assume  that  VT  is  independent  of  position  in  the  channel.
With  this  assumption  in  mind  calculate  the  inversion  layer  sheet  charge  density, 
qN*(y)  corresponding  to Bias  Point A  (i)  adjacent  to  the  source  (the  source  end,  y =  0)
and (ii) adjacent to the drain (drain end, y = L).

end  of  the  channel  at  Bias  Point  A. 
If  you  could  not  solve  Part  (c)  express  your 
answers in terms of the appropriate qN*.

(e)  [6 pts]  The transistor enters saturation at Bias Point B and simple theory suggests that
the drain-end  charge has become  0 while the drain-end  velocity  is  infinite, so  that  the 
IDSat  can  flow  in  that  part.  Now,  assuming  instead  that  the  electrons  at  the  drain  end 
move  at  their  saturation  velocity,  ssat=107  cm/s,  what  is  the  channel  charge  density 
that must exist there to support the IDsat?

(f)	 [3  pts]  Assuming  VCS(y)  is  the  voltage  that  a  hypothetical  voltmeter  would  measure
between the  inversion layer at position y along  the channel and  the source.  Derive an 
expression  that  could  be  solved  for VCS(L/2),  i.e.  at  distance  L/2  from  the  source  in a
device  biased  at  Bias  Point  C,  in  terms  of  the  transistor  parameters  and  IDsat.  You  do 
not  have  to  solve  the  expression  to  obtain  a  numerical  value  for  VCS;  your  expression 
can be an integral or differential equation.  Assume there is no velocity saturation. 
NOTE:  Do not  spend  a  lot of  time on  this  sub-question.  If  you don’t  see what
to do right away, move on and come back to try again later if you have time.

Problem 3 (34 points) 
This problem analyzes  the  inverter shown below.  The parameters for  the n-channel 
MOSFET pull-down  transistor,  and  the p-channel MOSFET pull-up transistor  are given 
below  the  figure.  The value  of  the  supply  voltage VGG  is  not  specified  (you will  find  it
in Part c), but you can assume that its value is such that QP  is not cut-off.

Parameters for the n-channel MOSFET (QN) and p-channel MOSFET (QP): 
LN  = LP  = 1 µm; WN  = 10 µm, WP  = 25 µm; µe = 500 cm2/V-s, µh  = 200 cm2/V-s;

sketch  the  transfer  characteristic,  VOUT  vs.  VIN,  on  the  set  of  axes  provided  below.
Identify on this sketch the regions of operation of the two MOSFETs.  This should be 
a  “free-hand”  sketch  without  paying  close  attention  to  the  parameters  of  the 
MOSFETs.

(c)  [4 pts]  Determine what value the pull-up gate bias voltage, VGG, must have to make 
the logic threshold VM  =VIN  = VOUT  = VDD/2.  If you could not do Parts (a) and (b) you
may  assume  both  transistors  are  in  saturation  at  this  point.  Ignore  channel  length 
modulation.  (Note:  VM  is the point on the transfer characteristic where vIN  = vOUT.)

are  in  saturation at  this point.  You must  include  channel  length modulation  in your 
analysis for this question.
