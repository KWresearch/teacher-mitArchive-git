7:30 to 9:30 pm 

Notes: 
1.  Unless otherwise  indicated, you  should assume  room  temperature and  that  kT/q  is
0.025 V.  You should also approximate [(kT/q) ln 10] as 0.06 V. 
2. 	 Closed book; two sheets (4 pages) of notes permitted. 
3.  All  of  your  answers  and  any  relevant  work  must  appear  on  these  pages.  	 Any

additional paper you hand in will not be graded.

4.  Make  reasonable  approximations  and  assumptions.  	 State  and  justify  any  such

assumptions and approximations you do make.

5. 	 Be careful to include the correct units with your answers when appropriate. 
6. 	 Be certain that you have all ten (10) pages of this exam booklet  and the four (4) page

formula sheet, and make certain  that you write your name at  the  top of  this page  in

the space provided.

7.	 An effort has been made to make the various parts of these problems independent of 

each other so if you have difficulty with one item go on, and come back later.

Problem 3 - (32 points) 
You are given a silicon MOS system as shown below.  The region from x = 0 to xA 
is very  lightly doped p-type with NA  =  1015  cm -3, while  the  region beyond  is heavily 
doped  p-type.   The  doping  levels  in  the  n +  poly  gate  and  in  the  p+  region  are  very 
high  and  not  specified,  but  you  are  given  that  φn+ =  0.54  V  and  φp+ =  -0.54  V.   The 
electrostatic  potential  of  the  contact  and  lead  metal,  φ ,  is  0.2  V.   Any  depletion 
m
regions  in  the  n+  and  p+  regions  can  be  assumed  to  be  of  infinitesimal  width,  i.e. 
modeled as Q’
pδ(xA), respectively.  Also, xox = 5 nm and xA = 10 nm.
