Problem 1:  Graded by Prof. Fonstad 
i)	 n-channel MOSFET:  Enhancement mode because VT  ≥ 0, which for an n-
a) 
channel MOSFET means that with vGS  = 0 there is no channel. 
p-channel MOSFET:  Depletion mode because VT  ≥ 0, which for a p-channel 
MOSFET means that with vGS  = 0 there is already a channel. 
ii)	 Negative because there is a hole inversion layer in the p-channel device, i.e.
electrons depleted from the area near the interface and holes attracted to the
interface, even with vGS  = 0.  Concurrently, it takes more gate voltage to invert 
the channel of the n-channel device, meaning more positive charge must be put
on the gate electrode which is balances by negative ions at the interface. 
iii)	 Larger, because the charging current is the current in saturation through the p-
channel device, and since the current in saturation for both of the devices is 
proportional to (VDD  – |VT|)2, this current is larger for the p-channel device 
since for it |VT| is smaller. 
iv)  Larger, because for both devices |VT| = |VFB| + |2φSi| + (tox/εox)(….)1/2. 
making tox  thicker, makes |VT| larger.

LEC: 
ii)  n-channel, because for a transistor in strong inversion and biased in saturation, 
gm  = (2KID)1/2  and we can assume that Kn  > Kp  because in general µe  > µh. 
iii)  Similar, because for a transistor operating sub-threshold gm  = qID/nkT, and the 
ID’s are equal and the n’s will be similar. 
In the linear region iD  = K(vGS -VT -vDS/2)vDS 
Transconductance:  gm  = ∂iD/∂vGS|Q  = KVDS 
Output conductance:  go  = ∂iD/∂vDS|Q  = [K(vGS -VT -vDS/2)-KvDS/2]|Q=K(VGS -VT -VDS)

a)  The iD-vDS  plot shows us that for the gate voltage applied the MOSFET saturates at a 
vDS  of 5 V.  We can find out what the gate voltage is using:  VDS,sat  = VGS  – VT: 
VGS  = VDS,sat  + VT  = 5 V + 1 V = 6 V 
b)  Near the origin, iD  = K(vGS -VT-vDS/2)vDS  and the slope is K(vGS -VT-vDS).  Evaluating 
this at the origin, we find that 
∂iD/∂vDS  (@ VDS  = 0) = K(VGS  – VT) = KVDS,sat 
where (VGS  – VT) = 5 V.  To find K and evaluate this we can use the saturation 
current, 10 mA, and saturation voltage, 5 V, in iD,sat  = K(vGS  – VT)2/2 =K(VDS,sat)2/2 to 
find: 
K = 2iD,sat/(VDS ,sat)2  = 2 (0.01/25) = 0.0008 A/V2 
With this the slope, KVDS,sat, is:  8 x 10-4  x 5 = 4 x 10-3  S 
c)  At any point in the channel, qN*(y) = -(εox/tox)(VGC -VT) = -(εox/tox)(VGS -VCS -VT) 
i)  At the source end of the channel, VCS  = 0, and we find: 
qN*(0) = -(εox/tox)(VGS -VT) = -(3.5 x 10-13/10-6)5 = -1.75 x 10-6  C/cm2 
ii)  At the drain end of the channel, VCS  = VDS  = 2.5 V, and we find: 
qN*(L) = -(εox/tox)(VGS -VDS -VT) = -(3.5 x 10-13/10-6) 2.5 = -8.75 x 10-7  C/cm2 
d)  The drift velocity can be found by remembering that iD  is the channel current and 
that the current at any point y along the channel is the sheet charge density in the
channel, qN*(y), times the drift velocity of the carriers composing this charge, times
the width of the channel:  iD  = - W qN*(y) se-Drift(y).  Thus:  se-Drift(y) = - iD/W qN*(y) 
i)  At the source end of the channel we find: 
se-Drif t(0) = iD/W qN*(y) = 7.5 x 10-3/5 x 10-3  x 1.75 x 10-6  = 8.57 x 105  cm/s 
ii)  At the drain end of the channel we find: 
se-Drif t(L) = iD/W qN*(y) = 7.5 x 10-3/5 x 10-3  x 8.75 x 10-7  = 1.71 x 106  cm/s 
e)  Now the relationship between the drain current and the charge density at y = L
must be iD  = - W qN*(L) ssat(y).  We want the charge density, so we solve for that: 
qN*(L) = - iD/W ssat(y) = -10-2/5 x 10-3  x 107  = -2 x 10-7  C/cm2 
f)  This is a difficult question and almost nobody got it correct.  This was anticipated
before the exam, but we decided to leave the question in with a precautionary note
added, just to see if anyone could do it.  That said, the  idea is to go back to the 
expression for iD  along the channel, and to integrate it from y = 0 to y = L/2, the
point along the channel at which we want to know vCS.  Since we know iD  already, 
we can find vCS(L/2).  The sequence leading to the expression sought is: 
iD,sat  = -W qN*(y) µe  dvCS/dy =  W (εox/tox)[VGS -vCS(y)-VT] µe  dvCS/dy 
iD,satdy = W (εox/tox)[VGS -vCS(y)-VT] µe  dvCS 
y iD,satdy =  iD,sat  y = ∫0
Vcs(y) W (εox/tox)[VGS -vCS -VT] µe  dvCS 
∫0

a) 

b) 

c)	 The threshold point occurs where both transistors are in saturation.  The equation 
for the curve there is: 
ID-sat n  = (Kn/2)(VGSn -VTn)2  = ID-sat p  = (Kp/2)(VSGp -|VTp|)2 
We know Kn  = Kp, VTn  = |VTp|, VSGp  = VDD  – VGG, and VGSn  = VIN = VDD/2, so we find 
VDD/2 - VTn  = VDD  – VGG  -|VTp|  ⇒  VGG  = VDD/2 = 2.5 V

d)  When both devices are in saturation at this bias point, the LEC is:


We find Av  = -gmn/(gon+gop).  There are several ways to write gm  in terms of the bias 
current and voltages, but the most useful here is  gmn  = 2IDn/(VGSn -VTn).  This along 
with gon  = λnIDn  and gop  = λpIDp, and using IDn  = IDp  = ID, λn = λp  = 0.1 V-1, VTn  = 1 V, 
and VGSn  = 2.5 V, lead us to: 
Av  = -gmn/(gon+gop) = 2/[(VGSn -VTn)(λn+λp)] = 2/(1.5 x 0.2) = - 6.6 
e)	 When VIN  = 5 V the n-channel device is on, and the p-channel device is saturated 
with ID  = Kp(VDD -VGG -|VTp|)2/2.  The corresponding static power dissipation is 
IDVDD.  Working through this we find 
PStatic  (VIN  = 5V) = IDVDD  = [(WP/LP)µhC*  (VDD -VGG -|VTp|)2/2] x VDD 
ox
= (25 x 200 x 6 x 10-7  x 1.52) x 5/2 = 16.8 x 10-3 W = 16.8 mW 
You did not have to include channel length modulation in this sub-section, but if 
you did you had an additional term  [1 + λ(VDS -VDS,sat)] =  1 + 0.1(5 – 1.5) = 1.35 
multiplying the current, and found: 
PStatic  (VIN  = 5V) = 16.8 x 1.35 = 22.7 mW 
f)	 When VIN  = 5 V the n-channel device is off, and the only static power dissipation is 
due to the sub-threshold current, ID,s-t, and is ID,s-tVDD.  This is probably negligible, 
but just to be sure, we start by calculating the sub-threshold current when vGS  = 0: 

vIN [V]505vOUT [V]vOUT = vIN - VTnvIN = VTLinearSaturationCut-offvIN [V]505vOUT [V]LinearSaturationvOUT = VGG - VTpvIN [V]505vOUT [V]n:  Cut-offp:  Linearn:  Saturatedp:  Linearn:  Saturatedp:  Saturatedn:  LInearp:  Saturated+-vingm,nvingo,n+-voutgo,piD,s-t  = [(WN/LN)µeC*  ] (kT/q)2  (n – 1) exp(-qVT/nkT)

= (10 x 5 x 102  x 6 x 10-7) (2.5 x 10-2)2  (1.5 – 1) exp[-1/(1.5 x 0.025)] 
≈ 9.3 x 10-7  e-27  A ≈ 9.3 x 10-7  x 1.6 x 10-12  ≈ 1.5 x 10-18 
From this we have PStatic  (VIN  = 0V) = 1.5 x 10-18  x 5 ≈ 10-17  W ≈ 0. 
g)  The low to high transition time is due to charging through the p-channel device 
with its saturation current, ID  = Kp(VDD -VGG -|VTp|)2/2 [= 3.36 mA from Part (e)], so 
we have: 
τLo-Hi  = CL  VDD/[Kp(VDD -VGG -|VTp|)2/2] = 10-13  x 5/(3.36 x 10-3) = 1.48 x 10-10  s
