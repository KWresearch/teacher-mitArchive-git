Notes: 

1.  An effort has been made to make the various parts of these problems independent of
each other so if you have difficulty with one item go on, and come back later. 
2.	 Some  questions  ask  for  an  explanation  of  your  answer.  No  credit will  be  given  for 
answers lacking this explanation. 
3.	 Unless otherwise  indicated,  you  should  assume  room  temperature  and  that kT/q  is
0.025 V.  You should also approximate [(kT/q) ln 10] as 0.06 V. 
4.  Closed book; one sheet (2 pages) of notes permitted.  Formula sheet provided. 
5.  All  of  your  answers  and  any  relevant  work  must  appear  on  these  pages.  Any 
additional paper you hand in will not be graded. 
6.  Make  reasonable  approximations  and	 assumptions.  State  and  justify  any  such 
assumptions and approximations you do make. 
7.  Be careful to include the correct units with your answers when appropriate. 
8.  Be certain that you have all ten (10) pages of this exam booklet and the three (3) page
formula  sheet,  and make  certain  that you write your name  at  the  top  of  this page  in

Problem 1 - (34 points) 
This problem contains 4 independent short problems that can be worked in any order. 
a) [6 pts]  You  find  a  sample  of  silicon,  but  the  accompanying  data  sheet  has  been
partially destroyed  so  you  only  know  that  it  is  n-type,  its  resistivity  is  100 Ohm-cm, 
and its electron mobility is 1600 cm2/V-s.  You also remember that ni(Si) = 1010  cm -3.

ulation  illustrated  on  the  right
is  established  in  an  n-type 
silicon  sample,  ND  =  1017  cm -3. 
The minority carrier  lifetime  in
this  sample  is  10-4  s,  the  hole
mobility  is  640  cm2/V-s,  and 
the  cross-section  of  the  sample

the  minority  carrier  lifetime  is  infinite  making  Lh  >>  wN,  while  in  Diode  B  the 
minority  carrier  lifetime  is  finite  and  small  enough  that  Lh  <  wN.  Note:  wN  is  the 
width of the n-type side, and Lh  is the minority carrier diffusion length.

Consider  the  silicon  diode  pictured  below.  It  is  4  µm  long,  with  ohmic  contacts  at 
each end, and it is uniform p-type with NA  = 1 x 1017  cm -3 for 1 µm on its far left end and

uniformly  doped  regions,  the  net  concentration,  Nd(x)  –  Na(x),  slowly  grades  linearly 
over  a  distance  of  2  µm  from  -1  x  1017  cm -3  on  the  left  to  1  x  1017  cm -3  on  the  right,  as
