which  the  hole-electron  recombination  process  in  the  quasi-neutral  regions  is  very 
efficient at producing blue  light.  They want your help designing p-n diodes  to  take 
advantage of this material to produce efficient blue light emitting diodes.

b)	 [6 pts]  So  those  of  you who  studied  BJTs  aren’t  disappointed,  and  so  those  of  you
who didn’t should still be able to get some points, here are the only BJT questions on 
the final.  Ten (10) word answers, or less.

a well designed device?

ii)  Why  is  an  npn  BJT  preferred  over  a  pnp  BJT  for  high  current  gain  and  high
speed?  [Hint:  same reason n-channel is preferred over p-channel MOSFET] 

iii)	 What is the meaning of  fT  (or ωT)  of a BJT  (or any  transistor,  for  that matter), and 
how does it depend on the base width, wB?

Consider  the two asymmetrically doped p-n junction diodes shown below  that have 
identical  uniform  doping  profiles,  but  are  made  of  different  semiconductors:  one  is 
made  of  silicon  (Si),  and  the  other  is made  of  germanium  (Ge).  The  room  temperature 
intrinsic  carrier  concentration  for  Ge,  ni-Ge,  is  √ 5  x  1013  cm -3  and  the  dielectric  constant, 
εGe, is 1.6 x 10-12  F/cm; for Si, ni-Si  = 1010  cm -3  and εSi = 10-12  F/cm.

the same  in both materials, and the same for holes.  Also, assume that the  lengths of  the 
corresponding  quasi-neutral  regions  are  the  same  and  that  carrier  recombination  only
takes  place  at  the  contacts  (i.e.,  that  the  minority  carrier  lifetime  in  the  bulk  regions  is
infinite).

Oxide dielectric constant, εox:  3.5 x 10-13  F/cm 
Gate length, Lmin:  35 nm

d)  [3 pts]  In  a  simple  CMOS  inverter  both  transistors  are  minimum  gate  length 
devices,  Ln  =  Lp  =  Lmin,  and  the  widths  are  scaled  so  that  Kn  =  Kp,  with  the 
narrowest gate being made Wmin.  What  should Wn  and Wp  be  in a  simple  inverter
made  with  this  process  (i.e.,  as  described  at  the  start  of  this  problem  statement)?
Note:  The multiples do not have to be integer.

e)  [4 pts]  To  size  the  FETs  in  a  NOR  gate  for  minimum  switching  time,  one  must
recognize  that  two  p-FETs  in  series  with  the  same  voltage  on  their  gates,  as  in  a 
NOR gate when both  inputs are  low,  function  like one FET with L = 2L (and W = 
Wp).  What  is  the  optimum  size  of  the  p-channel  MOSFETs  in  a  NOR  gate
fabricated with the process described earlier, and what is the load seen at the input
of  such  a  NOR  gate,  compared  to  an  inverter?  Note:  The  multiples  can  be  non-
integer.  (The  n-channel  FET  should  be  kept  the  same  size  as  in  a  simple  inverter
because turning either n-FET “on” pulls the output low.)
