Notes: 

1.  An effort has been made to make the various parts of these problems independent of
each other so if you have difficulty with one item go on, and come back later. 
2.	 Some  questions  ask  for  an  explanation  of  your  answer.  No  credit will  be  given  for 
answers lacking this explanation. 
3.	 Unless otherwise  indicated,  you  should  assume  room  temperature  and  that kT/q  is
0.025 V.  You should also approximate [(kT/q) ln 10] as 0.06 V. 
4.  Closed book; one sheet (2 pages) of notes permitted.  Formula sheet provided. 
5. The best way  to receive partial credit is to show your work.  All of your answers and 
any  relevant work must  appear  on  these  pages.  Any  additional  paper you  hand  in 
will not be graded. 
6.  Make  reasonable  approximations  and  assumptions.	 State  and  justify  any  such  as-
sumptions and approximations you do make. 
7.  Be careful to include the correct units with your answers when appropriate. 
8.  Be  certain  that  you  have  all  ten  (10)  pages of  this  exam  booklet  and  the  six  (6)  page 
formula  sheet,  and make  certain  that you write your name  at  the  top  of  this page  in

Problem 1 - (32 points) 
This problem contains 3 independent short problems that can be worked in any order. 
a) [8 pts]  Consider  an n-channel MOSFET with a  channel  length, L = 0.2 µm; width, W
=  of  5.0  µm;  electron mobility,  µe  =  600  cm2/V-s;  and  gate  oxide  capacitance,  C*  = 
ox 
10-8  F/cm2.  The  flatband  voltage, VFB  =  - 0.2 V,  and  the  threshold  voltage, VT  =  +0.5 
V.  The bias voltages are VBS  = VDS  = 0 V. 
i)  The MOSFET  is initially biased at flatband, and  then at t = 0, vGS  is changed from 
VFB  to  VFB  - 1  V.  After  any  transient,  what  is  the  total  amount  of  any  additional 
mobile charge at the oxide-semiconductor interface, and is it holes or electrons? 

Electrons _____  Holes _____  Total amount of charge: 
ii)  Where do the additional carriers in Part (a-i) come from? 

Coul 

iii)  The  MOSFET  is  initially  biased  at  threshold,  and  then  at  t  =  0,  vGS  is  changed 
from VT  to VT  + 1 V.  After any transient, what is the total amount of any additional
mobile charge at the oxide-semiconductor interface, and is it holes or electrons? 

Electrons _____  Holes _____  Total amount of charge: 
iv)  Where do the additional carriers in Part (a-iii) come from?

b) [10 pts]  Consider  operating  the  enhance-

ment-mode  n-channel  MOSFET  shown  to

the right as a  lateral npn bipolar  transistor.

Leave  the  gate  disconnected  and  focus  on

terminals B, S, and D.

i)  Label  the  terminals  B,  S,  and  D  in  the

figure with their corresponding BJT roles

(E, emitter; B, base; and C, collector), and

specify  the  approximate  voltage  levels

and  polarities  needed  to  bias  the  BJT  in

the forward active region.

ii)  If you measured the forward current gain, βf, of this BJT, you would find that it is 
small,  perhaps  even  less  than  1,  and  if  you  measured  the  Early  voltage,  VA,  you 
would find it is relatively low.  Explain each of these observations: 
The forward current gain, βf, is small because 

The Early voltage, VA, is low because 

iii)  Fabricating  a  lateral  BJT  with  an  underly-

ing  p+  layer  as  shown  to  the  right  improves

one  of  the  two  parameters  identified  in  Part

(b-ii),  but  has  little  impact  on  the  other.

Which is parameter is improved and why?

c)  [14 pts]  Graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon atoms, can be n- or p-type and  its 
hole  and  electron  mobilities  are  both  100,000  cm2/V-s.  Such  excellent  mobilities 
have  led  people  to  study  using  graphene-based  FETs  in  high  performance  digital 
and/or  analog  electronics.  The  characteristics  of  one  such  FET  are  given  by  the  ex-
pressions: 

where W and L are the gate width and  length,  respectively, µ is the carrier mobility, 
C* 
ox  is the oxide capacitance per unit area, and α accounts for the current at vGS  = 0 V. 
i)  Calculate an expression for the small-signal drain-to-source current, ids, in a gra-
phene transistor, as a linear function of the small-signal gate-to-source voltage and 
drain-to-source voltages, vgs  and vds, respectively, valid about the bias point, VGS,
VDS.

ii)  In the space provided below, draw a small signal  linear equivalent circuit for  the
graphene  transistor  for a bias point (VGS, VDS), and give  expressions  for each of  the
elements in the circuit in terms of device and bias parameters.

iii)  The  output  characteristics  of  graphene  transistors  recently  fabricated  at MIT  can
be fit by the expression:

Where  the  voltages  are  in measured  in Volts,  and  the  current  is  Amps.  Consider 
using  this  device  in  the  amplifier  illustrated  below  with  VDD  =  3  V  and  with  the 
gate biased at 1 V.  Select RL  to give a DC output voltage of 1.5 V, and calculate the

Alice  is  a  process  engineer  experimenting  with  a  new  high-permittivity  dielectric 
material with a dielectric constant, εhi, that is 5 times as large as the dielectric constant of 
SiO2.:  εhi  = 5 εox  She  chooses  to  test  the material  by  fabricating p-MOS  capacitors on  n-
type  silicon,  and  to  use  a  metal  for  the  gate  and  contact  for  which  φm  =  - 0.5  φn.  Her 
structure  is  illustrated  below;  it also  includes an  adjacent  p+  region  shorted  to  the  sub-
strate (not shown in the figure) to supply holes when an inversion layer is formed.

[8  pts]  A  practical  problem  with  depositing  a  dielectric  other  than  SiO2  directly  on 
silicon  is  that  new  energy  states  and/or  fixed  sheet  charge  are  introduced  at  the  in-
terface.  Imagine that the  latter occurs, and  that there  is a fixed positive sheet charge 
density, σi, at the interface.  Assuming that this charge can be modeled as an impulse 
of  charge  of  intensity  σi  at x  =  0,  i.e.  ρ(x)  =  σi  δ(x),  calculate  the  changes  in  the  flat-
band  voltage,  VFB,  and  in  the  threshold  voltage,  VT,  resulting  from  the  presence  of 
this charge.

vices,  Ln  =  Lp  =  Lmin,  and  the  widths  are  scaled  so  that  Kn  =  Kp,  with  the  narrowest 
gate  being made Wmin.  What  should Wn  and Wp  be  in  a  simple  inverter made with

[4 pts]  To  size  the  FETs  in  a  NAND  gate  for  minimum  switching  time,  one  must 
recognize  that  two  n-FETs  in  series  with  the  same  voltage  on  their  gates,  as  in  a 
NAND gate when both inputs are high, function like one FET with L = 2L n  (and W = 
Wn).  What  is  the  optimum  size  of  the  n-channel  MOSFETs  in  a NAND  gate  fabri-
cated  with  the  process  described  earlier,  and  what  is  the  load  seen  at  the  input  of
such  a  NAND  gate,  compared  to  an  inverter?  Note:  The  multiples  can  be  non-
integer.  (The p-channel FET should be kept the same size as in a simple inverter be-
cause turning either p-FET “on” pulls the output high.)
