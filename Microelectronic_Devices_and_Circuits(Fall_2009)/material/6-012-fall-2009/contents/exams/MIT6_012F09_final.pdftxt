Problem 1 - (25 points) 
Three short problems: 
a)  [8 pts]  Consider the two bars of p-type Si, NA, = 1017 cm-3  illustrated below.  They
are  40  µm  long with  ohmic  contacts  on  each  end,  and  are  identical  except  that
in  one  the  minority  carrier  lifetime,  τmin,  is  10-5  s,  and  in  the  other  it  is  10-9  s.    
The electron mobility, µe, is the same, 1,600 cm2/V-s, in both. 
The  bars  are  illuminated  with  constant  radiation  generating  ML  hole-
electron pairs/cm2-s uniformly across the plane at x = 0, i.e. gL(x,t) = MLδ(x).

b)  [8  pts]  This  question  concerns  the  design  and  operation  of  CMOS  inverters  in 
the sub-threshold region. 
In the space to the right draw the cir
-
cuit  schematic  of  a  standard  CMOS

inverter  indicating  the  type  of  each

transistor  (n-MOS  or  p-MOS),  and

labeling  the  sources,  drains,  and

gates  (S,D,G),  and  the  input,  output, 

and  supply  voltages  (vIN,  vOUT,  and

VDD).

ii) 	 Designing  CMOS  to  operate  in  the 
sub-threshold region makes it possi-
ble  to make very  low power, albeit slow, digital  integrated circuits.  Which of 
the options below for designing CMOS to operate in the sub-threshold region 
is the most effective in lowering the power dissipation per gate? 
_____	 By  designing  transistors  with  threshold  voltages  of  larger  magnitude, 
|VT|  than  are  conventionally  used  along  with  conventional  VDD  val-
ues. 
_____	 By using smaller supply voltages, VDD, than are conventionally used. 
_____	 By  using  transistors  with  much  longer  gate  lengths  than  convention-
ally used so the drain currents are very small. 
Explain your answer: 

iii)	 Write  expressions  for  the  drain  currents  of  the  transistors  in  the  schematic
you drew in Part b) i) in terms of vIN, vOUT, and VDD  assuming they are operat-
ing  in  the  sub-threshold  region:  iD  =  IST  exp(vGS/Vt)  [1  –  exp(-vDS/Vt)] where 
Vt  ≡ kT/q. 

iv)	 Below write  the  equation you would  solve  to  calculate  the  transfer  character-
istic of your sub-threshold CMOS inverter.

 c)  [9  pts]  A  transimpedance  amplifier,  which  is  the  subject  of  this  question,  is  an 
amplifier  that  generates  a  small-signal  output  voltage  proportional  to  the 
small-signal  input  current. 
It  is  also  called  a  current-to-voltage  converter.  
Typically  this circuit has very  low  input and output  resistance  to maximize  the 
current-to-voltage conversion.   
i)	 Three  single-transistor  stages  that  can  be  used  to  build  transimpedance  am-
plifiers  are  illustrated  below.  Label  each  of  these  stages  (i.e.,  common-base, 
source-follower, etc.) on the line provided below each schematic.

The  p-n  diode  structure  below  is  illuminated  with  light  generating  M  hole-
electron pairs per cm2-s  in  the plane at x = 2W, as  indicated  in  the drawing.  The  in-
tensity  of  the  illumination  is  sufficiently  low  that  all  of  the  classic  flow-problem  as-
sumptions  hold: 
low  level  injection,  quasi-neutrality,  negligible  minority  carrier 
drift,  and  quasi-static  excitation. 
In  this  diode  the  minority  carrier  lifetime  is  infi-
nite, the hole mobility is 600 cm2/V-s, and the electron mobility is 1600 cm2/V-s.

and the total hole and electron currents in the illuminated device with the bias

Useful observations:  
1.  With  no  base  contact  and  infinite  minority  carrier  lifetime,  what  flows  into  the  base 
from  the  emitter  must  flow  out  through  the  collector;  similarly  what  flows  into  the 
base from the collector must flow out through the emitter.
2.  A  portion  of  the  2  V  bias  will  reverse  bias  the  base-collector  junction  and  a  portion 
will  forward  biases  the  base-emitter  junction.  The  size  of  the  latter  portion  depends
on the size of the emitter currents needed to yield a self-consistent situation.

Problem 3 - (25 points)
  The  finFET  is  a MOSFET  structure  that  is  receiving  a  large  amount  of  research 
and  development  attention  because  it  offers  promise  for  solving  the  challenge  of 
making Si MOSFETs even smaller  (i.e., channel  lengths under 20 nm).  It  is basically
a  vertical  rectangular  bar  (fin)  of  silicon  sitting  on  an  insulating  surface with  source 
and drain regions on either end and with a gate dielectric and metal draped over  its
middle,  as  illustrated  in  the  cartoon  below  left.  The  cross-section  of  a  finFET  you 
can use for a 6.012-type one-dimensional electrostatic analysis is shown on the right.

forms along the upper, left-hand, and right-hand oxide-semiconductor interfaces.

Assume that the oxide thickness, tox, is 7 nm, the fin thickness, tfin, is 20 nm, the
