acceptor concentration of 5 x 1017  cm -3; minority carrier diffusion length, Lmin, of 100 µm;

Problem 3 - (33 points) 
You are given the following asymmetrical silicon (Si) n+-p junction diode structure 
with wn = 1 µm, wp = 4 µm, and τe = τh = ∞.  The n-region of this diode is heavily doped, 
ND = 1019 cm-3 .  The p-region is composed of two sub-regions with doping NA1 and NA2 
as shown.  The width of the first sub-region, w1 , is 2 µm.  Assume the mobilities are µ  =

a)  [15 pts]  First consider a diode in which the two p-type sub-regions have the same
doping level with NA1 = NA2 = 1015 cm-3 .  In Parts i) and ii) assume there is zero 
applied bias, vAB = 0 V; in Part iii) assume forward bias, vAB > 0.  Calculate the 
following quantities:

ii)  The width of the depletion region on the p-side of the junction, xp.

b)  [18 pts]  Next consider a device in which the second region is doped much more
heavily p-type with NA2 = 1018 cm-3 .  The doping level in the first region is the same 
as before, i.e., NA1 = 1015 cm-3 .  The width of this first region is 2 µm. 
i)	 Consider the situation with zero applied bias, i.e., vAB = 0 V.  What is the  built-in 
potential, φb, of the junction? 

ii) 	 A bias, v AB = V1 , is applied so that the width depletion region on the p-side of this 
diode, xp, is 2 µm, i.e. the first p-region is fully depleted.   What is V1?
 

φb = ________________ V 

 V1  = vAB(such that xp = w1 ) = ________________V 

iii)	 With a bias applied as in Part b) ii) so that xp = w1  = 2 µm, what is the small signal 
linear equivalent junction capacitance per unit area, C ab(V1 ) ≡ ∂q AB/∂vAB|vAB = V1? 
Hint:  Think "depletion region width" rather than "complicated formula." 

Junction capacitance per unit area, C ab(V1  ) = _________________ F/cm2

NA1=1016 cm-3, NA2=1015 cm-3 .  There is zero volts applied bias, vAB = 0.   You may 
assume that w 1 << xp and treat the depletion charge in Sub-region 1 as a delta 
function at x=0+.
