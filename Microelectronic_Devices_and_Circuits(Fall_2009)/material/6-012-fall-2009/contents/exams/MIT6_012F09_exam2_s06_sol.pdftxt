Problem 1:  Graded by Prof. Fonstad 
i)  A less than B, because K varies inversely with L. 
a)	
ii)  A similar to B, because the threshold voltage does not depend on L. 
iii)  A greater than B, because A has a smaller K and thus must be biased stronger. 
iv)  A less than B, because VA is bigger for the longer device, and thus go is smaller. 
v)  A greater than B, because the area of the gate (WxL) is larger. 
vi)  A similar to B, because Cgd is proportional to the device width and that is the 
same in both devices. 
i)  A less than B, because IES is dominated by NAB and proportional to 1/NAB. 
ii)  A similar to B, because ICS is dominated by NDC and that is the same in both 
devices.  A less than B was also accepted. 
iii)  A less than B, because the emitter defect increases with NAB, and β ≈ 1/δE. 
iv)  A similar to B, because gm = qIC/kT and is the same for both devices. 
v)  A less than B, because VA increases as the doping increases, and go = IC/VA 
vi)  A similar to B, because Cµ is nominated by the collector doping, which is the 
same in both devices.  A greater than B was also accepted. 
i)  Essentially unchanged, because the sum of the n- and p-channel MOSFET gate
areas is still 3WminLmin. 
ii)  Decreased, because the p-FET is now narrower and delivers less current. 
iii) 
Increased, because the n-FET is now wider and can draw more current. 
iv)  Essentially unchanged, because the static power is zero.  (Trick question?) 
v)  Essentially unchanged, because the logic HI voltage is still VDD.

iv)  One increased, one decreased, because the nearly vertical portion of the 

transfer characteristic is no longer centered about VDD/2.

Problem 2:  Graded by Prof. Hoyt 
a)  βF = iC/iB = 9.25 mA/92.5 µA = 100 
b)  δB = 0, because the lifetime is infinite, meaning the minority carrier diffusion length
is also infinite. 
c)	 The factor in question appears in the emitter defect expression, and we can find the
emitter defect because we know βF and βF  ≈ 1/δE, when δB is negligible, as it is here: 

βF and βF  ≈ 1/δE =(DeWE,effNDE)/(DhWB,effNAB) = (De/Dh) r, so r = βF(De/Dh) = 50 
d)  Use the Gummel plot to find a value for IES, and then use IES to find NAB: 
IC  ≈ IES exp (qVBE/kT), and IES  ≈  Aqni
2(De/WB,effNAB), 
so NAB = Aqni
2(De/WB,effIC) exp (qVBE/kT) = 1 x 1017 cm-3 
e)  With the results of Parts (c) and (d), we find NDE = r WB,effNAB/WE,eff = 1 x 1019 cm-3

c)	 xp = xA = (2 εSi  Δφ/q NA)1/2 = 10 nm.   We find  Δφ  =  0.08 V 
 
The assumption is justified because the total potential change, which is|VFB|, is 
much greater than this value.

e)	 Neglecting qNAxA relative to Qn' and Qp', then Qp' ≈ Qn'.   The situation looks like a 
 
parallel plate capacitor with two different dielectrics.  The total potential drop from 
x = -xox to x = xA is VFB, or 0.84 V.  The drop across the  oxide is Qp'xox/εox and that 
across the silicon is Qp'xSi/εSi.  Adding these together and setting them equal to VFB, 
Qp'xox/εox + Qp'xSi/εSi =  VFB, we find 
Qp' = VFB/(xox/εox + xSi/εSi) = 3.5 x 10-7 C/cm2 
f)  The charge in the depleted lightly doped p-region is: 
-qNA xA = 1.6 x 10-19 1015 10-6 = - 1.6 x 10-10 coul/cm2 
This is much less than Qp', so it neglecting it was a good approximation.
