***** Problem Sets *****
Most problem sets will be handed out in recitation on Wednesdays, and will be
due the following Wednesday. Solutions submitted late will be noted as having
been submitted, but there is no guarantee that they will be graded. This will
depend on the availability and agreeably of the graders.
We welcome collaboration, but we also want to know who you have worked with on
the problem set, and we expect you to prepare the final solution individually
and to hand in your own work. What you put down on paper must honestly reflect
your effort and ability. If you have worked closely with other students to
figure out solutions to a problem set, please so state at the end of the
solution you submit; this will help us confirm that problem sets were not
copied and protect you from being wrongly accused.
***** Tutorials *****
The Teaching Assistants will conduct one-hour tutorial sessions each week for
small groups of students. Written problem set solutions will be distributed at
the tutorial session immediately following the due date.
***** Exams *****
There will be two evening exams. These exams will be closed book, and you will
be able to bring a 2-page, hand written crib sheet (to be handed in with your
exam). You should also bring a calculator. There are no formal recitations on
exam days, but your recitation instructors will be available in their offices
to answer questions during your normal recitation hours. There will be a three-
hour closed book final exam.
***** Design Problem *****
A special take-home exam problem on circuit design will be distributed after
Ses #19; this assignment will be due a bit more than two weeks later. Late
design problems will not receive full credit. Students must submit a
satisfactory design problem solution to receive a grade in 6.012.
***** Grading *****
The following algorithm will be used to establish a score for you in 6.012: (1)
two hour exams, 20% each; (2) final exam, 33%; (3) design problem, 15%; (4)
problem sets, 12% total.
This score will serve as a starting point for an assessment by the staff of
your overall mastery of the subject matter. Your letter grade will also reflect
your performance in recitations and tutorials, and will be the outcome of the
total evaluation process.
