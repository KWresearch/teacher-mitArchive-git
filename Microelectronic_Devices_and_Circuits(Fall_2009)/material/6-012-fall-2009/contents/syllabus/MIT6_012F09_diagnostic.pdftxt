6.012 - Electronic Devices and Circuits - Take Home Diagnostic Exercise 

The  four  problems  in  this  exercise  deal  with material  you  will  use  in  6.012  from  the
prerequisite  courses.  Give  yourself  one  hour  to  work  it.  Solutions  will  be  distributed  at 
the next recitation and you can then judge for yourself which material you need to review. 
Problem 1 - Basic linear circuit analysis 
Consider the circuit illustrated below: 

(a)	 What is the voltage v OUT  when the input voltage, vIN, is 2 Volts? 

vOUT  = 
(b)	 What is the Thevenin equivalent resistance of the circuit to the right of Nodes 1 
and 2? 

RT  = 

Problem 2 - Linear differential equations 
Consider a parameter cP(t), which varies temporally according to the equation: 
dcP(t)/dt + A cP(t)  =  B 
where A and B are positive constants.  What is cP(t) for t > 0 if cP(0) = 0 and cP(t) is 
finite? 

cP(t)  = 

+-+-1 k!vA1 k!10 k!10 k!vIN+-vOUTA vAA  =  1 mS12Problem 3 - Linearization about an operating point 
Consider the non-linear two-terminal electronic device, D, illustrated below on 
the left.  The current through the device, iD(t), is related to the voltage across its 
3), where B  =  10-3  A/V and C = 
terminals, vAB(t), by the equation, iD(t)  =  B (vAB  + C vAB 
4 V-2..  There is no charge or flux storage associated with this device. 

A linear equivalent circuit for the device D valid for small signal operation about a
bias point, vAB  =  VAB, is shown to the right.  What is R for the bias point VAB  =  2V? 

Problem 4 - Simple electrostatics 
In a certain sample of material the electric field, E(x,y,z), varies only in the x-
direction, i.e., E(x,y,z) = E(x), where E(x) is shown below.  The dielectric constant, ε, is 
uniform throughout the sample with a value of 10-10  coul/V-cm. 

R = 

On the axes provided below, sketch and dimension the net charge distribution in 
this sample. 

End of diagnosis; you may get up from the couch.
