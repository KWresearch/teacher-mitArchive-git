6.012 - Electronic Devices and Circuits - Take Home Diagnostic Exercise 

The  four  problems  in  this  exercise  deal  with  material  you  will  use  in  6.012  from  the 
prerequisite  courses.  Give  yourself  one  hour  to  work  it.  Solutions  will  be  distributed  at 
the next recitation and you can then judge for yourself which material you need to review.

(a)  What is the voltage v OUT when the input voltage, vIN, is 2 Volts?
  First notice that 
vOUT  = R4 iB , 
iB  = − Av A ,    and     v A  = R2iA .  Then do a loop equation for Loop A to get : 
iA (R1 + R2 ) + (iA  − iB )R3  = v IN .  Combine the first two equations to get  vOUT  = - AR4v A     and then put the second 
and third equations into the last equation and solve for v A  in terms of v IN .  Put this into the expression for vOUT 
 
vOUT  = −{AR2R4  [R1  + R2 (1 + AR 3 ) + R3 ]}v IN  .  Putting values in yields : 
to get : 
vOUT  = −10v IN  22  V. 

(b)  What is the Thevenin equivalent resistance of the circuit to the right of Nodes 1 
and 2?
  The Thevenin equivalent resistance we want is  v12  iA  ,   and  v12  = R2iA  + (iA  +  Av A )R3 .  Substitute v A  = R2iA 
and solve for R T  :  RT  = v12  iA  = R2  + R3 (1 + AR2 ) = 22 kΩ. 
Problem 2 - Linear differential equations 
Consider a parameter cP(t), which varies temporally according to the equation: 
dcP(t)/dt + A cP(t)  =  B 
where A and B are positive constants.  What is cP(t) for t > 0 if cP(0) = 0 and cP(t) is 
finite?
  The homogeneous solution to this equation is :  c p , HS ( t ) = C1e− At .  The particular solution is :  c p , HS ( t ) = B A . 
the total solution is thus :  c p ( t )  =  B A + C1e− At ,with  C1  such that  c p (0) = 0.  Clearly C1  = − B A ,  and thus 
B
c p ( t )  = 
A (1 − C1e− At )

Problem 3 - Linearization about an operating point 
Consider the non-linear two-terminal electronic device, D, illustrated below on 
the left.  The current through the device, iD(t), is related to the voltage across its

Problem 4 - Simple electrostatics 
In a certain sample of material the electric field, E(x,y,z), varies only in the x-
direction, i.e., E(x,y,z) = E(x), where E(x) is shown below.  The dielectric constant, ε, is 
uniform throughout the sample with a value of 10-10 coul/V-cm. 
E(x) [V/cm] 

.   We find :  gd  = B(1 + 3CVAB ).   Thus :  R = 1  [B(1 + 3CVAB )] = 40 Ω.
