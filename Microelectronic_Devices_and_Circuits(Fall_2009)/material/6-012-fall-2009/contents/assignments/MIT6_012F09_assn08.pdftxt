Note  on  this  Problem  Set:  Most  of  the  problems  on  this  set  originated  in  modified
form  as  questions  on  prior  exams,  and  have  relatively  short,  quick  answers.  It  may
seem  long  at  first,  but  it  is not  that bad,  and  as you work  through  it you will  hopefully
find yourself reviewing material that will be on the exam, i.e., studying for the exam. 

Problem 1 - This problem has two parts.  Think of it as a warm-up for Hour Exam 2. 
(a)	 Consider  two  npn  silicon  bipolar  junction  transistors,  A  and  B.  All  of  the 
dimensions  of  these  two  devices,  and  the  magnitudes  of  all  of  the  doping  levels  in 
these  two  devices  are  identical,  except  that  the  base  width,  wB,  of  Transistor  A  is 
twice that of Transistor B. 
(i)	 Which  transistor,  if  either,  has  the  larger  dc  current  gain,  βF?  Explain  your 
answer and estimate the ratio of the two βF's. 
(ii)	 Which transistor, if either, has the larger emitter-base junction saturation current, 
IES?  Explain your answer and estimate the ratio of the two IES's. 
(iii)	 With the base-collector  junctions of both transistors reverse biased with the same 
values of base-collector junction voltage, VBC, which transistor, if either, has the 
largest  small-signal  base-collector  junction  capacitance,  Cµ?  Explain  your 
answer and estimate the ratio of the two Cµ's. 
(iv)	 With  both  transistors  biased  at  the  same  quiescent  collector  current  level,  IC, 
which  transistor,  if  either,  has  the  largest  small-signal  transconductance,  gm? 
Explain your answer and estimate the ratio of the two gm's. 
(v)	 With  both  transistors  biased  at  the  same  quiescent  collector  current  level,  IC,
which  transistor,  if  either,  has  the  largest  small-signal  input  resistance,  rπ? 
Explain your answer and estimate the ratio of the two rπ  's. 
(vi)	 Which transistor, if either, has a larger Early voltage, VA?  Explain your answer.

(b)	 This part involves MOSFETs. 
(i)	 Consider  two  MOSFETs,  one  an  n-channel  MOSFET  and  the  other  a  p-channel 
MOSFET.  They have  identical dimensions, and  both are biased  in  the  saturation 
region  at  the  same  drain  current,  |ID|.  Which  of  the  devices,  if  either,  would 
have the larger transconductance, gm, and why? 
(ii)	 Consider  two  MOSFETs,  one  an  n-channel  MOSFET  and  the  other  a  p-channel 
MOSFET.  They  have  identical  dimensions,  and  both  are  biased  in  the  sub-
threshold  region at  the  same drain  current, |ID|.  Which of  the devices,  if  either, 
would have the larger transconductance, gm, and why? 
(iii)	 An n-channel MOSFET operating  in a  circuit was mistakenly biased  in  the  linear 
region.  Derive  expressions  in  terms  of  VGS,  VDS,  and  K  for  its  transconductance, 
gm,  and  output conductance,  go,  in  this  situation.  Assume vBS  = 0 and α = 1,  and 
ignore the Early effect, i.e., assume λ = 0. 
Problem  2  - Consider  the  n-channel  MOSFET  circuit  pictured  to  the  right.  The  circuit  is 
biased with VAC  = VDS  = 2 Volts.  The MOSFET has  following 
parameters: 

K = 2 mA/V2 
VT  = 1 V 
α = 1 
λ = 0.01 V-1 
η = 0.2 
A  small  signal  voltage,  vac(t),  is added  to  the  2 V bias  so now 
vAC(t) = 2 V + vac(t). 
(a)	 What are the bias and small signal values of vGS, vDS, and

vBS?

(b)	 Use  the  linear  equivalent circuit  (LEC)  for  a MOSFET  to
draw the full LEC for this circuit.  Evaluate all of the parameter values in your LEC. 
(c)	 Reduce  your  LEC  in  Part  ii)  to  a  single  element  and  give  an  expression  for  this 
element in terms of gm  and go. 
Problem 3 - On  Slide  8  in  Lecture  14  the  voltage  gain  of  an  NMOS  inverter  stage  is
calculated  for  the  bias  point  VIN  =  VOUT,  which  is  in  the  steep  portion  of  the  transfer 
characteristic.  The  substrate  and  source  of  the  depletion mode  pull-up MOSFET  were
shorted  together,  but  this  is  not  possible  in  many  fabrication  processes.  Instead,  the 
substrate  of  the  pull-up  MOSFET  must  be  tied  to  ground.  Redo  the  voltage  gain 
calculation in this case by doing the following steps: 
(a)	 What is the small signal base-to-source voltage, vbs,pu, on the pull-up MOSFET? 
(b)	 Draw the small signal linear equivalent circuit of the pull-up MOSFET.  Notice that 
incrementally  the  drain  is  also  connected  to  ground  so  that  the  substrate  and  drain 
are  connected  incrementally.  Thus  the  pull-up  MOSFET  looks  like  a  two  terminal
device  in  this  connection  and  its  LEC  is  simply  a  resistor  (i.e.,  rpu  or  gpu).  Give  an 
expression for gpu  in terms of go,pu  and gm,pu.  (Remember gmb  and gm  are related.) 
(c)	 Draw the LEC for the entire inverter; be sure to indicate vin  and vout. 

GSBDAC3V+!3 

(d)	 Derive  an  expression  for  the voltage gain, Av  = vout/vin,  (i)  in  terms of  gm,  gmb,  and 
go  of  the  two  transistors,  and  (ii)  in terms of  the bias point current and K, λ,  and η of 
the two transistors. 
(e)	
Is the gain larger or smaller  than when the pull-up substrate was tied  to its source, 
or is it no different?  Explain your answer. 
Problem 4 - The  gates  on  a  CMOS  logic  chip  were  laid  out  by  a  designer  who  had  not 
taken 6.012 and they have Wp  = Wmin  and Wn  = 2 Wmin, instead of  Wn  = Wmin  and Wp  = 2 
Wmin.  What was  the  impact  of  this error  on  the  following  inverter performance metrics
relative to the usual case of an inverter with Wn  = Wmin  and Wp  = 2 Wmin?  State whether 
each` has increased, decreased, or not changed appreciably, and explain your answers. 
Inverter input capacitance, CL. 
(a) 
(b)  The output node charging current after the input has switched from HI to LO. 
(c)  The output node discharge current after the input has switched from LO to HI. 
(d)  Static power dissipation. 
(e)  The logic HI voltage. 
(f))  The noise margins.
