Problem  1  - We  say  that  we  can  approximate  the  minority  carrier  lifetime  in  Si  as  being
infinite  even  though  it  is  really  several  hundred  milliseconds,  because  this  is  a  long
time  compared  to  the  time  it  takes  a  hole  or  an  electron  to  drift  or  diffuse  across  a 
device  to  a  contact  or  junction.  To  verify  this  statement  consider  the  following  two 
questions: 
a)  With drift, the time it takes a carrier to go (transit) a distance d is: τtr,Drift  = d/µE. 
i)	 How long does it take an electron (µe  = 1600 cm2/V-s) to drift 10 µm in a field of 
10 V/cm? 
ii)  Repeat a) i) for a hole (µh  = 600 cm2/V-s). 
iii)	 Compare  your  answers  in  a)  i)  and  a)  ii)  to  a  lifetime  of  100  ms.  Is 
approximating this lifetime as “infinite” in this situation reasonable? 
b)  With diffusion, the time it takes a carrier to transit a distance d is: τtr,Diff  = d2/2D. 
i)	 How  long  does  it  take  an  electron  (De  =  40  cm2/s)  to  diffuse  10  µm  in  a 
concentration gradient of 1015  cm -3  per micron? 
ii)	 Repeat b) i) for a hole (Dh  = 15 cm2/s). 
iii)  Compare your answers in a) i) and a)  ii) to a  lifetime of 100 ms. Is approximating
this lifetime as “infinite” in this situation reasonable?

Problem 2 - Do Problem 3.9, Parts a thru d, in the course textbook. 
Problem 3 - Two short problems: 
i)  Do Problem 4.3 in the course textbook. 
ii)  Do Problem 4.2 in the course textbook. 
Problem 4  - The n-type  silicon  sample  illustrated  on  the  top  of  the next page  is 10 microns
(µm)  long  and  has  metal  ohmic  contacts,  A  and  B,  on  either  end.  The  net  donor 
concentration  is  1  x  1015  cm -3;  the  electron  mobility,  µe,  is  1600  cm2/V-s;  and  the  hole 
mobility,  µh,  is 600  cm2/V-s.  The electrostatic potential  of  the metal  relative  to  intrinsic 
silicon is 0.2V, and the intrinsic carrier concentration at room temperature is 1010  cm -3. 
Use the 60 mV rule to calculate the electrostatic potential, i.e. use (kT/q) ln 10 = 0.06 V.

a)	 What  are  the  thermal  equilibrium  (i.e.,  no  light,  vAB  =  0  V)  hole  and  electron 
concentrations and electrostatic potential, φn, in this silicon? 
b)	 Sketch  the  electrostatic  potential,  φ(x),  with  vAB  =  0  V,  going  from  the  metal  on  the
left,  through  the  silicon,  and  into  the  metal  on  the  right.  Dimension  your  sketch; 
label any significant features. 
c)	 Assume now  that vAB  = 0.5 V.  Sketch  the  electrostatic potential,  φ(x), with vAB  = 0.5 
V,  going  from  the  metal  on  the  left,  through  the  silicon,  and  into  the  metal  on  the
right (where you should assume  the value of  ø  is unchanged,  i.e. 0.2 V).  Dimension 
your sketch and label any significant features, including φ(0). 
e)	 When vAB  = 0.5 V, what are the electron and hole drift current densities, Je
respectively, at x = 0 µm 
Next  consider  a  sample  similar  to  our  original  sample,  except  that  it  is  doped  p-type 
with a net acceptor  concentration of  1  x  1015  cm -3  in  the  region  from x = 0 µm  to x  = +5 
µm as shown below.  Note:  This is a diode with the p-side to the right.

f)	 Sketch  the  electrostatic  potential,  φ(x),  going  from  the metal  on  the  left,  through  the 
silicon,  and  into  the metal  on  the  right, with vAB  = 0 V.  Dimension your  sketch and 
label any significant features, including the value of φ(0). 
g)	 The  diode  is  now  reverse  biased  by  vAB  =  0.5  V.  Sketch  the  electrostatic  potential, 
φ(x), now, going from the metal on the left, through the silicon, and into the metal on 
the  right.  Keep  φ  in  the  metal  to  the  right  of  x  =  5  µm  at  the  value  it  had  in  Part  f.
Dimension  your  sketch  and  label  any  significant  features,  including  the  value  of 
φ(0).
