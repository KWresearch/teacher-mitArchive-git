Problem  1  - Do  Problem  10.2  in  the  course  text  using  a  substrate  doping  level, NA,  of  1  x 
1016  cm -3  in Parts (a) thru (c) rather  than 1 x 1017  cm -3, and assuming  that the value of  the 
parameter  α  in  the  model  developed  in  Lecture  11  is  one  (1).  Also  add  the  following 
parts to this problem: 
d)	 Consider building  the same device with tox  = 100 A  .  What must the doping  level of 
the  substrate, NA,  be  to have  the  same  threshold  voltage you  found  in Part  (a)?  For
simplicity  assume  the  flat-band  voltage,  VFB,  is  still  -0.2  V,  but  after  calculating  the 
new NA, find the actual flat-band voltage with this new doping level. 
e)	 Repeat Part (b) and compare the answer for this new device with that of the original. 

Problem 2 - This is a former exam problem (with all the work space and blanks removed),
so it won’t take you long to do. 
An  ideal  n-channel  MOSFET  has  the  iD  vs  vDS  characteristic  shown  below  when 
vGS  = 4 V and vBS  = 0 V.  Note that the drain current saturates at 2 mA for vDS  ≥ VDS,sat. 
iD 
iD,sat  = 2 mA 

vGS,  = 4 V, vBS,  = 0 V 

vDS,sat 
The threshold voltage, VT(vBS) of  this device  is 1 V when vBS  = 0 V, i.e. VT(0) = 1 V.  It 
has the structural parameters listed below.  Work this problem approximating α as 1. 
NA  = 1017  cm -3, W = 25 µm, L = 10 µm, tox  = 10-6  cm, and εox  = 3.5 x 10-13  F/cm

a)	 What is the drain-to-source saturation voltage, vDS,sat, when vGS  = 4 V? 
b)	 Use the information provided to calculate the electron mobility, µe, in the channel. 
c)	 Find  the  inversion  layer  sheet  charge  density  in  the  channel,  qN*(y),  at  the  source 
end,  i.e. qN*(0), and at the drain end, qN*(L),  for  the bias condition VGS  = 4 V, VDS  = 1 
V, and VBS  = 0 V. 
d)	 Find  the average net velocity,  sy(y), of  the electrons in the  channel at the source end, 
i.e.  s y(0),  and  at  the  drain  end,  sy(L),  for  the  bias  condition  in  Part  (c)  above,  for
which the corresponding drain current, ID, is 0.55 mA. 
e)	 The drain-to-source voltage, vDS, is increased to 5 V, so that the bias condition is now 
VGS  = 4 V, VDS  = 5 V, and VBS  = 0 V.  Find  the  inversion layer sheet charge density  in 
the  channel,  qN*(y),  at  the  source  end,  i.e.  qN*(0),  and  at  the  drain  end,  qN*(L)  under 
this new bias condition. 
f)	 Next  consider  this  MOSFET  with  a  negative  substrate-to-source  bias,  VBS.  What  is 
the drain  current of  this device when  it  is biased  in  saturation,  i.e., with VDS  ≥  (VGS  -
VT), with VGS  = 4 V and VBS  = - 5 V?  Suggestion:  Calculate VT  when VBS  = -5V using 
the expression below, and calculate iD  in saturation with this new VT. 
Threshold voltage expressions: 
The definition of the threshold voltage of a MOSFET is: 

It is very common to write this in terms of VT(0),  the threshold when vBS  = 0, and 
to introduce the parameter γ as shown below: 

Problem 3 - This  problem  deals  with  the  α factor  in  the  gradual  channel  model  for  the 
MOSFET (see for example the Lecture 11 Foils). 
a)	 Calculate  the  α factor  for  the  two  device  structures  in  Problem  1  above.  Use  your 
results to recalculate the drain current, iD, in Parts (c) and (e) of that problem. 
b)	 Calculate  the MOSFET  α  factor  for  a  device  in  which NAp  is  5  x  1017  cm-3,  and  the 
oxide thickness is 3 nm (3 x 10-7 cm).  Take εox  to be 3.5 x 10-13 F/cm and εSi  to be 10-
12 F/cm.  Do this for back-to-source biases, vBS, of 0, -1, and -2 V. 
Problem  4  - Diode-like  connections  of  MOSFETs  are  quite  useful  and  important  to 
understand.  Look  at  Figures  11.12  (a),  (b),  and  (c)  on  page  351  in  the  course  text.
Calculate  and plot  iD  for vAB  between 0 and  6 Volts using  the device parameters given 
in the figure caption.  (These are curves a, b, and c in part e of this figure.)
