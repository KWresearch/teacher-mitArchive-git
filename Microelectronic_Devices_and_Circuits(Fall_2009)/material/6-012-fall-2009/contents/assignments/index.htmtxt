Design problem answer sheet
The performance parameters of your design should be entered on this
answer sheet in the spaces provided, and the sizes and bias level         (XLS)
currents and voltages of all of the transistors (assuming the quiescent
output voltage is zero Volts) should also be entered on the answer sheet.
Spring 2006 design problem
Slides prepared for the Spring 2006 6.012 students to accompany that
semester's design problem. The circuit has similarities with this
semester's design problem, and you may find these slides to be useful.    (PDF)
The circuit details, device parameters, and performance specifications
are different in the two design problems, but the slides are relevant
just the same.
