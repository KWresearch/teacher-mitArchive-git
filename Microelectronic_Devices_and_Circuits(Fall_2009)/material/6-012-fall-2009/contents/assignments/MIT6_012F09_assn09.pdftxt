Problem  1  -
The  p- and  n-channel  MOSFETs  in  this  question  have  the  following 
parameter values: 
(Wn/Ln)µnCox = (Wp/Lp)µpCox  = 5 x 10-4  A/V2, VTn  = 0.25 V, VTp  = -0.25 V 
gmb  = 0.2 gm, λn = λp  = 0.05 V-1, |VON-substrate diodes| = 0.7 V 
+ 1V 

a)	 An  n-channel  MOSFET  and  p-channel 
MOSFET are connected to form a CMOS 
gate,  but  the  substrate  contacts  are 
mistakenly  connected  to  the  drains  of
their respective transistors, as illustrated
to  the  right.  Your  task  in  this  question
will  be  to  determine  the  impact  of  this
mistake  on  the  transfer  characteristic  of 
this inverter.

i)	 Draw  the  low  frequency  small  signal  linear  equivalent  circuit  for  this  inverter  at
the bias point VIN  = VOUT  = VM  = VDD/2.  Evaluate gmn, gmp, gmbn, gmbp, gon, and gop,
and indicate which, if any, of these parameters have the same values. 
ii)	 What  is  the  slope  of  the  transfer  function  of  this  inverter  at  this  bias  point,  i.e., 
VIN  = VOUT  = VM  = VDD/2?  Express your answer  in terms of  the gxx 's and simplify 
it as much as you  can.  Then also express your  answer  in  terms of  the bias point 
voltages and currents.  Compare your answer to that of the correct connection. 
iii)	 Given that the substrate p-n junction diode turn on voltage is 0.7 V, sketch Vout  vs 
Vin  (the inverter transfer characteristic). 
b)	 The engineer who made the  layout mistake  in Part (a) also made a layout mistake at
his pervious job, and it was a rather more serious blunder (which is why he now has
a  different  job).  While  trying  to  design  a  CMOS  inverter  he  connected  the  n-MOS 
transistor  to  the  +  1 V  supply  and  the  p-MOS  transistor  to  ground,  as  shown  in  the 
figure on the next page. 

i)	 When  vIN  has  been  0 Volts  for  a  long  time,

vOUT  is  also  0  Volts.  Starting  at  this  point,

consider  increasing vIN  to 1 Volts.  What  is

vOUT  when  vIN  reaches  1  Volts?  Make

certain it is clear to the grader how you got

your answer.

+ 1 V 

ii)	 After vIN  has been  incresed  to 1 Volts as  in

Part  c)i)  above,  it  is  again  reduced  to  0 

Volts.  What  is  vOUT  when  vIN  reaches  0

Volts now?  HINT:  It is not 0 Volts.

iii)	 Sketch  vOUT  vs  vIN  starting  at  the  condition  in Part  c)ii)  and  increasing vIN  to  1 V, 
and then decreasing it back to 0 V. 

Problem 2 - This  problem  deals  with  CMOS  inverters  fabricated  using  a  process  in which
the  minimum  gate  length  and  width  are  Lmin  and  Wmin,  respectively. 
In  order  to 
obtain  symmetrical  transfer  characteristics  and  minimize  the  gate  delay,  the  inverters
are  designed  to  have  VTn  =  |VTp|,  toxn  =  toxp,  and  Kn  =  Kp.  All  the  inverters  have 
minimum  length  gates,  i.e.,  Ln  =  Lp  =  Lmin,  and  the  width  of  the  p-channel  devices  is 
twice  that  of  the  n-channel  devices,  i.e.,  Wp  =  2Wn,  because  the  hole  and  electron 
mobilities in  the  channel differ by  a factor  of  two,  i.e., µe  = 2 µp.  The  smallest  inverters 
have Wn = Wmin  and Wp  = 2 Wmin, and we will call the corresponding K value Kmin. 

This  minimum  size  inverter  is  shown  above.  The  gate  delay,  τGD,  of  this 
minimum  size  inverter  is  found  to be  100 ps  (10-10  s) when  the  fan-out  is one.  We will 
call this gate delay the minimum gate delay, τmin. 
(a)	 What  is  the  gate  delay  of  a  minimum-size  inverter  that  has  a  fan-out  of  four,  i.e., 
when its output is connected to four stages? 
(b)	 The  inverters which  drive  the  bond  pads  and  the wires  going  to  other  chips must
supply  much  larger  currents  because  they  have  much  larger  capacitances  to  charge
and  discharge  than  do  the  inverters which  simply  drive  other  inverters  on  the  same 
chip.  We  will  call  these  "output  inverters."  Suppose  that  on  the  present  chip,  the
MOSFETs in the output inverters must have K values of 100 Kmin. 
(i)	 What are Wn  and Wp of the devices in the output inverters?

(ii)	 What  is  the  input  capacitance  of  these  output  stages  in  terms  of  the  input
capacitance  of a minimum-size inverter, which you can call Cmin? 
(iii)	 What would  the  gate delay  be  for  a minimum-size  inverter  loaded with  a  single
output inverter stage,  i.e.,  loaded with the capacitance you found above  in Part
(c)(ii)? 
(c)	 Consider  inserting  an  inverter  stage with K  =  10 Kmin  between  the minimum-size 
inverter and an output inverter. 
(i)	 Draw  the circuit schematic for  these three  inverter stages,  indicating next to each 
device its gate width. 
(ii)	 What are the gate delays, τGD's, for the first (Kmin) and second (10 Kmin) stages in 
this circuit? 
(iii)	 What is the total delay going through both the Kmin  and 10 Kmin  stages, and how 
does it compare with your answer in Part (c)(iii)? 
If  one  intermediate  stage  before  an  output  stage  is  good,  are  two  better?  How 
about n, where n > 2?  Is there an optimum n? 

(iv)	

Problem 3 - A couple of problems on current source bias design. 
(a)	 Do Problem 12.6 in the course text. 

In  integrated  circuits,  bias  stack  resistors  like  that  in  the

(b)	
circuit  of  the  previous  problem,  are  often  replaced  by

MOSFETs with  their gates  connected  to  their drains.  This  is

attractive because resistors consume a  lot of space on a  chip,

and are hard  to fabricate with precise values.  An example is

the  circuit  on  the  right.  Use  the  transistor  specifications  at

the  end  of  this  problem  set  to  answer  the  following

questions about this circuit.

a)	 Design  the  gate widths  and  lengths  of Q1,  Q2,  and  Q3  so

that  VA  =  1.3  V  and  VB  =  0.7V.  Keep  the  power

dissipation as low as possible, and give its value.

b)	 Now  design  the  gate  widths  and  lengths  of  Q1,  Q2,  and

Q3  so  that  VA  =  1.2  V  and  VB  =  0.6V.  Again  keep  the

power dissipation as low as possible, and give its value.


Problem 4 - A two-part problem. 
(a)	 Consider  the  common-source  stage  with  shunt  feedback  shown  on  Foil  22  of 
Lecture 18. 
(i)  Use the linear equivalent circuit shown on the foil to calculate the input resistance 
of this stage. 
(ii)  Write your result from Part a in terms of  the magnitude of the voltage gain of  the
stage.  See  if  you  can  explain why RF  looks  like  a much  smaller  resistor  than  it  really 
is.  This is called the Miller Effect. 

ABQ1Q2Q3+ 2 V4 

(b)	 The  two-port  voltage  gain  of  a  common-source  amplifier  is  –gm/(go+gsl)  as  was
discussed  in Lecture 18  (see Foil  15);  this is also  true  for  the BJT version of  this  stage,
which is called a common-emitter amplifier.  The magnitude of  this two-port voltage 
gain occurs when the stage load is infinite (gsl  = 0), and it is Av,max  =  gm/go. 
Consider  common-source/-emitter  amplifiers made with  the  following  transistors
and  for  each  find  an  expression  for Av,max  in  terms  of  the  quiescent  drain  current,  ID,
and determine for each if there is a bias current that maximizes Av,max, and what it is. 
(i)  An n-channel enhancement mode MOSFET biased in saturation (strong inversion)
for which velocity saturation is not important. 
(ii)  An n-channel enhancement mode MOSFET biased in the sub-threshold region. 
(iii)  A  very  short  gate  n-channel  enhancement  mode  MOSFET  biased  in  saturation 
(strong  inversion)  in  which  velocity  saturation  dominates  at  even  small  drain-to-
source voltages. 
(iv)  An npn BJT biased in its forward active region.
