Lecture 19  (11/17/09)  - Chap. 12 (12.1, 12.2, 12.3) 
Lecture 20  (11/19/09)  - Chap. 12 (12.4, 12.5), Chap. 13

Problem 1 – The Lee Load, which will be used  in the first stage of  the design problem, can
be  modeled  by  the  two  terminal  circuit  shown  below  containing  a  voltage  dependent
voltage  source  whose  value  is  different  for  difference- or  common-mode  inputs  to  the 
associated  differential  stage.  Consequently  the  LEC  for  the  load  is  different  for 
difference- and common-mode analysis. 

The two n-MOS transistors in this circuit are identical with the same dimensions and 
values  of  K,  VT,  and  λ.  Assume  that  VAB  >  VT  so  both  transistors  are  active  (and 
operating in saturation). 
a)	 Find  the linear equivalent conductance of  this circuit when A = -1.  This is goLL,dm,
the equivalent conductance of  the Lee Load  in a difference mode half circuit (i.e.,
1/roLL,dm  in the upper half circuit on Slide 23 of Lecture 20). 
b)	 Find the linear equivalent conductance of this circuit when A = +1.  This is goLL,cm,
the  equivalent  conductance  of  the  Lee  Load  in  a  common mode  half  circuit  (i.e.,
1/roLL,cm  in the lower half circuit on Slide 23 of Lecture 20).
Use your  results  in Parts a and b  to find expressions  for Avd  and Avc  of  the  first  stage of 
the  design  problem  circuit  in  terms  of  gm4,  gm8,  go4,  go8,  and  go10.  Then  write  your 
expressions  in  terms  of  the  K’s,  VA’s,  ID’s,  and  VGS’s.  Eliminate  ID  from  your 
expressions  and  then  calculate  the  maximum  possible  value  of  |Avd|  and  of 
|Avd|/|Avc|.

Use the two-port models for the common-source and common-gate stages (shown 
below) to compare the voltage gain and output resistance of this two-stage amplifier to 
the single common-source amplifier shown above on the left. 

You  can  find  expressions  for  the  elements  in each of  these  two-port models on  the  foils 
for  Lecture  18.  Note  that  the  substrate  of  the  transistor  in  the  common  gate  stage  has
been  connected  to  the  source  so  the  gmb  factor  should  be  deleted  from  the  expressions
also  assume  that  the  stage  load  conductance,  gsl,  is  negligibly  small  so  you  can  say  it  is 
zero (so, for example, Rin  is simply 1/gm, and the current gain is identically one). 
a)	 Calculate the voltage gain, vout/vin, of  the  two-stage amplifier and compare  it to that 
of the single common-source stage. 
b)	 Calculate the output  resistance, Ro, of  the  two-stage amplifier and compare  it to  that 
of the single common-source stage. 

Problem 3 - The circuit shown at the top of the next page contains n-channel and p-channel 
MOSFETs  all  of  which  have  the  same  gate  length,  L  =  Lmin;  all  the  gate  widths,
however,  are  not  equal,  but  they  are  all  integer  multiples  of  Wmin.  All  have  an  Early 
voltage, VA, of 10 V;  the magnitude of all of their  threshold voltages, VT, is 0.5 V; and all 
must be biased with |VGS  - VT| ≥ 0.1 V. 
The K-factor of an n-channel MOSFET with L  = Lmin  and W = Wmin  is 250 µA/V2, and 
the K-factor of a p-channel MOSFET with L  = Lmin  and W = Wmin  is 125 µA/V2.

The drain  current of Q8  is known  to be  10 µA,  and W7,  the width of Q7,  is known  to 
be Wmin.  The resistor R1  has been selected so that Q1  and Q7  are biased with |VGS  - VT| = 
0.1 V.  The widths of Q2, Q3, Q4, and Q5  have been chosen so that for each of them |VGS  -
VT| = 0.1 V when vIN1  = vIN2  = 0. 
For Parts a), b), c) and d) connect Node B to Node A. 
a)	 This part concerns the bias chain Q1, R1, and Q7.

i)  What is ID7, the drain current of Q7, and that is W1, the width of Q1?

ii)  What is the value of the resistor R1?

b)  What  is  the most negative  common mode  voltage,  vIC,  that can be  applied  to  the
input  terminals  before  one  or  more  transistors  in  the  amplifier  are  forced  out  of
saturation?  Remember that Node B is connected to Node A 
c)	 What  is  the  small  signal  output,  vout, with  the  following  difference-mode  inputs: 
vin1  =  va  and  vin2  =  -va?  Give  your  answer  in  three  forms:  (i)  an  expression  in 
terms of  the gm's and go's of  the relevant transistors,  (ii) an expression in terms of
the  bias  points  of  the  relevant  transistors,  and  (iii)  a  numerical  value.  Assume 
the voltage gain of  the  source-follower  output  stage  (Q6)  is 1.  Remember:  Node 
B is connected to Node A. 

d)	 Draw  the  linear  equivalent  half-circuits  for  this  amplifier  for  the  following 
common-mode  inputs:  vin1  =  vin2  =  vic.  Label  your  drawings  in  terms  of  the  gm's 
and go's of  the relevant transistors.  You do not need  to find numerical values for 
the elements.  Recall that Node B is connected to Node A. 
e)	 How  will  your  answers  in  Part  c)  change  if  Node  B  is  connected  to  Node  C,
instead  of  to  Node  A?  State  the  change  and  give  the  name  of  this  circuit 
topology, i.e., of this connection. 
For the rest of this problem leave Node B connected to Node C.

f)	 Size Q6  and Q9  so  that  the  output  resistance  of  this amplifier  is 1000 Ohms AND
so  that  the  quiescent  output  voltage  (vOUT  with  vIN1  =  vIN2  =  0)  is  0.  The  widths 
should be integer multiples of Wmin. 
g)	 For  your  design  in  Part  f,  what  is  the  most  negative  value  vOUT  can  have  if  the 
output is attached to a 1 kOhm load resistor?  Hint:  This occurs when vGS6  gets so 
small that Q6  cuts off and all of the drain current of Q9  (the current sink) is drawn 
from ground through the 1 kOhm load resistor. 
h)	 For  your  design  in  Part  f,  what  is  the  most  positive  value  vOUT  can  have  if  the 
output  is  attached  to  a  1  kOhm  load  resistor?  This  occurs  when  the  voltage  on 
the gate of Q6  is so high that Q3  is pushed out of saturation because vSD3  becomes 
too small.  What is vGS3  at this maximum value of vOUT? 
Note:  Parts  g  and  h  should  show  you  why  a  push-pull  output  stage  is  used  in  the

design problem circuit.

Problem  4  - Consider  the  differential  amplifier  circuit  illustrated  below.  In  this  circuit  the 
three  n-channel  MOSFETs  are  identical;  they  have  a  threshold  voltage,  V ,  of  1  V,  a 
T
drain  current  in  saturation  of  2.5(v –  V )2  mA,  and  an  Early  voltage  of  10  V.  The 
GS 
T
MOSFETS  should  be  operated  with  (vGS  - VT)  ≥  0.2  V.  The  npn  bipolar  junction 
transistors  (BJTs)  all  have  forward  betas,  βF,  of  100  and  an  Early  voltage  of  50  V.  The 
BJT sizes have been adjusted to that to a good approximation you may use VBE,ON = 0.6 
V;  VCE,SAT  =  0.2  V.  Assume  CS  is  a  short  at  mid-band  frequencies,  and  R2  and  R3  are 
identical. 

Note  that  value  of  the  resistor  R4,  the  quiescent  collector  current  on  Q4,  and minimum 
quiescent  voltage  on  the  gate  of  Q3  are  indicated  on  the  schematic,  as  are  the  supply 
voltages.

a)	 What  must  the  bias  level  (IBias)  on  Q3  be  to  have  a  quiescent  output  voltage  of
approximately  0  V?  (Assume  that  the  quiescent  collector  current  of  Q4  is  2  mA,  as 
indicated, and do not forget its base current.) 
b)	 Select R5  be  to be  consistent with  a quiescent  collector  current  in Q4  of  2 mA,  and  a 
quiescent output voltage of approximately 0 V. 
c)	 Select  R1  to  give  a  bias  current  through  Q5  of  1  mA.  You  may  ignor  the  base 
currents of Q5, Q6, and Q7. 
d)  i)	 Draw  a  small  signal  linear  equivalent  half  circuit  one  could  use  to  calculate  the 
signal  voltage  on  the  gate  of  Q3  due  to  the  difference-mode  input  signal,  vin1  -
vin2.  Find an expression for this voltage in terms of incremental linear equivalent
circuit model parameters. 
ii)	 Write  an  expression  for  the  differential-mode  voltage  gain  of  the  differential

stage  (Q1, Q2)  in  terms of  the  resistors,  the MOSFET K-factors,  and  the quiescent

bias  levels  of Q1  and  Q2.  Select R2  (= R3)  and  the  drain  current  of Q1  and Q2  to

maximize this voltage gain (magnitude).

e)	 Suppose  you  can  replace  R2  and  R3  with  a  current  mirror  made  with  p-channel 
MOSFETs with |VT| = 1 V and |VA| = 20 V.  Draw the schematic of such a current 
mirror, and calculate what impact this would have on the voltage gain. 
f)	 Looking  at  the  output  stage, what  are  the most  positive  and  negative values  of  vout 
possible?  Explain your answers.
