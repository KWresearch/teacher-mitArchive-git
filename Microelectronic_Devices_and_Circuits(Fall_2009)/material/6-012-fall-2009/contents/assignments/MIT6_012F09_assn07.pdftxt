Lecture 14  (10/29/09)  - Chap. 15 (15.1)


Consider  an  n-channel  silicon MOSFET  and  a  p-channel  silicon MOSFET 
Problem 1 -
which are  identical  in all dimensions and doping  level magnitudes except  that  the gate 
length,  L,  of  one  of  the  devices  is  twice  that  of  the  other.  The  K-factors  in  the  large 
signal characteristics are also identical.  [The K-factor is defined as (W/L)µ(εox/tox).] 
(i)	 Which  transistor,  if  either,  would  you  expect  to  be  the  one  with  the  longer  gate
length, and why? 
(ii)	 What  is  the  ratio of  the  electron  to hole mobility  in  these  transistors  (i.e., what  is
the  ratio  of  the  mobility  of  the  electrons  in  the  channel  of  the  n-channel 
MOSFET  to  that  of  the  holes  in  the  channel  of  the  p-channel  MOSFET)? 
Explain. 
(iii)	 Which  transistor,  if  either,  has  the  larger  small-signal  gate-to-source  capacitance 
in saturation, Cgs?  Explain your answer. 
(iv)	 Which transistor, if either, has the larger small-signal gate-to-drain capacitance in 
saturation, Cgd?  Explain your answer. 
(v)	 Both  transistors  are  biased  in  saturation  so  they  have  the  same  magnitude  of
quiescent  drain  current,  ID.  Which  transistor,  if  either,  has  the  largest  small-
signal transconductance, gm?  Explain your answer and estimate the ratio of the 
two gm's. 
(vi)	 Which transistor, if either, has a larger Early voltage, VA?  Explain your answer. 
Problem  2  - This  problems  examines  and  compares  (or  contrasts)  the  sub-threshold  and 
strong  inversion  operation  of  an  n-channel  MOSFET  like  the  one  we  used  as  the 
example  in Lecture 12.  As you will recall,  that device had tox  = 3 nm and NA  = 1018  cm -3. 
This resulted in having n = α = 1.25.  Assume that it also the electrostatic potential of the 
gate  metal  (degenerately  n-doped  poly-crystalline  silicon)  is  0.55  Volts,  the  channel
length is 100 nm, and the electron mobility in the channel is 800 cm2/V-s. 
(a)	 What are the flat-band and threshold voltages of this device when vBS  = 0? 
(b)	
(i)  What is the factor γ  (which was defined  just before Problem 3 on Problem Set
6)  for  this device?  This factor is called  the “body  factor” and is a gauge of how much
the threshold voltage changes with substrate (body) bias, vBS. 
(ii)	 What is the threshold voltage if vBS  = -1Volt?

(c)  How wide must the gate be to have K = 1 mA/V2?  (Remember to include α.) 
(d)	 What  is  the  drain  current  in  saturation  when  this  device  is  biased  1  Volt  above 
threshold? 
(e)	
(i)  What  is  the  drain  current  in  saturation  when  this  device  is  biased  0.12  Volts 
below threshold? 
(ii)  What is the drain current in saturation when vGS  = vBS  = 0? 
(iii)  How  much  power  is  dissipated  in  an  integrated  circuit  containing  106 
transistors  like  this,  each  in  series with  a  load  connecting  a  1.5 V  power  supply buss
to  ground  [as,  for  example,  in  Figure  15.2(c)  in  the  course  text]  when  all  of  the
transistors are off with vGS  = 0? 
Problem  3  - Several  three-terminal  devices  (e.g.,  vacuum  tube  triodes,  static  induction 
transistors, field-emitter display pixels) have characteristics like those illustrated below: 

iG  = IG(eqVGK/kT -1) 
and 
iP  = G(M vPK  + vGK)3/2 
with G = 2 mA/V3/2, M = 0.06, and IG  = 10-6  A 
(a)  An incremental model for a device with these characteristics is illustrated below. 

Find mathematical expressions for each of the parameters in the incremental
model (gi, gr, gf, and go) and evaluate these expressions at the bias point VGK  = 
- 4 V, and VPK  = 160 V.

Select  RG1  and  RP  to  achieve  the  bias  point  specified  in  Part  (a),  i.e.,  VGK  =  - 4 V, 
and VPK  = 160 V. 

Problem 4  (“iLab” problem)  - This problem requires that you use a remote-control device 
measurement and characterization system called "iLab".  Go to http://ilab.mit.edu, sign
up  for  a user  account  if  you don’t have one  already  (this  can  take  a day or  two,  so  sign
up well before this problem set is due), and read the user manual provided there.  After 
reading  the manual,  go  to  “Launch  Lab”  and make  your measurements  using  the  Java
applet that appears. 
You  select  the  device  that  will  be  under  test  from  the  "Device"  menu.  For  this 
problem use one of the two devices named “3u nMOSFET” (#4 and #6). 
Look  at  the  output  characteristics  of  this  device  as  directed  below.  Prepare  and 
submit the plots requested, and give the requested parameter values. 
Caution:  Do not let vGS  exceed 3 V or vDS  exceed 4 V. 
a)	 On linear scales, plot iD vs vDS  for 0 ≤ vDS  < 4 V, with vGS  as a parameter (0 ≤ vGS  ≤ 3 V) 
and with  vBS  =  0.  Estimate  the  threshold  voltage,  VT,  and  the  Early  voltage,  VA,  for 
this device. 
b)	 Repeat Part (b) with vBS  =  - 0.5 V. 
c)	 Plot  iD  vs vGS, with vDS  = 4 V and  vBS  = 0 V on  a  linear  scale.  Also plot  (iD)1/2  vs vGS,
and  use  this  plot  to  find  the  threshold  voltage,  VT,  and  the  K-factor  of  this  device 
with vBS  = 0. 
d)	 Display  the  plot  of  iD  vs  vGS, with  vDS  =  4 V  and  vBS  =  0 V  in  Part  (c)  on  a  log-linear 
scale  and  use  it  to  estimate  the  sub-threshold  slope  and  the  value  of  “n”.  Also 
determine  the  factor  IS,s-t  in  the  expression  for  sub-threshold  current  (see,  for 
example, Slide 21 in Lecture 12).

e)	 Use  the  techniques  in  Parts  (c)  and  (d)  to  estimate  the  threshold  voltage,  sub-
threshold slope, the factor IS,s-t, and “n” when vBS  =  - 0.5 V. 
Comment on whether  the changes you find from the vBS  = 0 case have the right sign, 
and whether they seem reasonable. 
f)	 Return  to your plot of  iD vs vDS  for  0 ≤ vDS  < 4 V, with vGS  as a parameter  (0 ≤ vGS  ≤ 3 
V)  and with vBS  = 0  in Part  (a),  but only plot  it  for  (0 ≤ vGS  ≤ VT),  and make  it a  log-
linear plot,  i.e.,  log  iD vs vDS.  You might even  try  to make  the  steps  in vGS  be nkT/q, 
and compare your plot to that on Slide 26 of Lecture 12. 
g)	 Optional extra fun  (I am curious to see what you find):  Your estimates of K, n, and 
ISs-t  in  Part  (d)  should  all  be  consistent,  and  in  fact  should  be  related  (see Slide  21 of
Lecture 12).  You should find:  IS,s-t  = Ko  (kT/q)2  (n-1).  What do you actually find? 
Note:  The  estimates  you  found  in  Part  (e)  should,  of  course,  also  be  related.  You

may want to check that too.


Additional final comments on iLab: 
The "auto scale" function might be useful for displaying plots. 
For research purposes, the system keeps a record of all logins and all scripts that

each user executes.
