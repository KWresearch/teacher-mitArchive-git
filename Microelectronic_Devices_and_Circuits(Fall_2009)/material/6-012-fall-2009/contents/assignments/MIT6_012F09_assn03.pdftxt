Note:  The first hour  exam is  scheduled  for Wednesday night, October  7,  from 7:30  to
9:30  pm Please  let  me  know  as  soon  as  possible  (by  e-mail)  if  you
have  a  conflict  so  we  can  resolve  it  as  painlessly  as  possible.  The  exam  is  closed 
book  and will  cover  the material  through 10/2/09 and Problem Set #4  (p-n  junction 
diodes and BJT basics). 

Problem 1  - Do Problem 7.3 in the course text. 
Problem 2 - This problem concerns a bar of p-type silicon, NA  = 1017  cm -3,  irradiated on its 
left  end  with  a  uniform  electron  beam  having  an  electron  flux  of  1019  cm -2s-1  as 
illustrated below.* 
As  shown,  the  sample  is  10 µm  long  and  has an  ohmic  contact  on  its  right  end;  this
contact  is  connected  to  the  electron  source  to  complete  the  circuit  as  indicated.  In  this 
sample  the  hole mobility,  µh,  is  600  cm2/V-s;  the  electron mobility,  µe,  is  1600  cm2/V-s; 
the  electron  diffusion  length,  Le,  is  100  µm;  and  the  intrinsic  carrier  concentration  at 
room temperature, ni, is 1010  cm -3. 

(a) What is the electron  current density  just inside the bar at the  left end,  i.e. what is
Je(0+)? Show your work and/or explain your answer. 
(b) Write a formula for n'(x) in terms of n'(0) and then determine the value of n'(0). 

*  In case you are concerned:  The electron beam hitting the left end of the bar behaves like an injecting
contact.  The injected electrons do not have sufficient energy to generate more hole-electron pairs. 
Also, no holes can leave the lef t end of the bar.

(c)  Write an expression for the electron current density, Je(x), valid for 0 < x < 10 µm. 
(d) Write an expressioin for the hole current density, Jh(x), valid for 0 < x < 10 µm. 
(e) Write an expression for the electric field, Ex(x), valid for 0 < x < 10 µm. 
(f)  What is the voltage drop from end  to end  in this sample?  Note:  this is the same
as the change in electrostatic potential between x = 0 and 10 µm. 
Problem 3  - Do Problem 7.5 in the course text. 
Problem 4  - This problem  concerns  the  two abrupt p-n diodes pictured  below.  These  two 
diodes have identical dimensions and differ only  in the doping levels on the p-sides.  In 
both diodes  the n-side  is doped with 1017  cm-3  donors.  In Diode A  the p-side  is doped 
with 1018  cm-3  acceptors and  in Diode B  it  is doped with 1016  cm-3  acceptors.  You may 
assume for purposes of this problem that:
(1)  the  widths  of  the  depletion  regions  on  either  side  of  the  junctions  in  these
diodes are all negligible relative to 5 µm when they are forward biased,
(2)  the hole mobility  is 600 cm2/V-s and  the  electron mobility  is 1600  cm2/V-s in 
all regions, and
(3) the minority carrier diffusion lengths are much larger than 10 µm. 

c)	

a)	 Which diode has the wider zero-bias depletion region?  Explain your answer. 
b)	 With  zero  applied  bias,  in which  diode  is  the magnitude  of  the  peak  electric  field
in the depletion region largest?  Explain your answer. 
For which  diode will  the magnitude  of  the  reverse  breakdown  voltage be  largest? 
Explain your answer. 
d)  A  reverse bias  is  applied  to  both  diodes  so  that  the  depletion  region  on  the  n-side 
in each diode is 0.2 µm wide. 
i)  What is the width of the depletion region on the p-side in each diode? 
ii)  On which diode is the magnitude of the reverse bias larger?  Explain. 
e)  A forward bias is applied to each diode so that the excess hole population on the n-
side at xn, p'(xn), is 1012  cm-3  in both diodes. 
i)  What  are  the  excess  electron  populations  at  the  edge  of  the  depletion  region  on 
the p-side, i.e., n'(-xp), in each diode? 
ii)  What  is  the  ratio  of  the  total  hole  current  to  the  total  electron  current  through
each diode at x = 0? 
iii)  What is the total excess minority carrier charge per unit area in each diode at this 
bias level?  Note:  Consider the entire device, i.e., from - 5µm to + 5 µm. 
iv)  What is the applied bias on each diode?
