Some ﬁnd the MOSFET symbols used in this version of the schematic with the
arrow on the source, rather than the gate, more intuitive when looking at a
schematic.  The rest of the foils in this set use the original symbols, so this ﬁgure 
help you adapt those foils if you prefer these alternative symbols.

A constraint on the bias currents is the total power dissipation
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
speci ﬁcation of 7.5 mW.  This means that the total bias current
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
must be less that 2.5 mA (i.e, 3 V x 2.5 mA = 7.5 mW).

Points to ponder:
- The outputs go to the gates of other MOSFET, so they do not load this stage.  What
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
does this about getting the maximum difference mode out of this stage?

3.  Second gain stage:  source-coupled cascode, current mirror load 
 
 
 
  
 
 

Comments/Observations:
- This stage is essentially a normal
   
 
 
 
source-coupled pair with a current
 
 
   
 
mirror load, but there are differences.. 
 
 
 
 
- The ﬁrst difference is that two driver
 
 
 
 
 
 
transistors are cascode pairs.  The stage
 
  
 
 
 
 
thus has two sub-stages, the ﬁrst being a
 
 
 
 
 
 
source-coupled pair which is loaded by
 
 
 
 
 
 
the second, which is a common-gate
 
 
   
   
 
 
  
pair.  The combination of a common
source stage followed by a common gate
 
   
 
 
 
stage is called a "cascode. 
   
 
 
- The second difference is that the
 
 
 
 
 
current mirror load is also cascoded. 
 
 
 
 
 
- The third difference is that the stage is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
not biased with a current mirror, but is
instead biased by the ﬁrst gain stage. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Point to ponder:
- Notice that output of the stage is loaded by the input resistance of the third stage.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the ﬁrst stage there was no loading.  How does this effect the gain and how we 
 
 
maximize it?

Point to ponder:
- When the output is not loaded the voltage gain, 2VA,eff/(VGS3 - VTN), does not depend on 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
the K's of the transistors, but when it is loaded by rload, making K bigger can increase the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gain.

Points to ponder:
- What is the value of gload?
 
 
 
 
 
 
- Is it feasible to bias Q16  and Q17 to get the largest gain?  How close can one come?
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- Changing the bias on Q16/Q17  means that of Q9/Q10/Q11/Q12 must change.  Is this OK? 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- How much can K be increased?  Is there any disadvantage to making K this big?

Comments/Observations:
- These stages involve four emitter
 
 
 
 
 
follower building blocks arranged as
 
 
 
 
 
 
two parallel cascades of two emitter
 
 
follower stages each.  These stages
 
 
 
  
 
 
offer the most design challenges and
 
 
 
trade-offs of any of the stages in the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
design problem.
- They must be biased properly
 
 
 
 
 
 
taking into account KVL and KCL
 
 
 
constraints. 
- Although they have voltage gains of
 
 
 
 
 
 
almost one, they have a big effect on
   
 
 
 
 
 
the overall voltage gain of the
 
 
 
 
 
ampliﬁer because they load the second
 
 
 
 
 
gain stage.
- They determine the output
 
 
 
 
 
 
resistance of the ampliﬁer.

4.  Third and fourth stages:  putting it all together 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Comments/Observations:
- These stages involve four emitter
 
 
 
 
follower building blocks arranged as
 
 
 
 
two parallel cascades of two emitter
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
follower stages each.  These stages offer
 
 
the most design challenges and trade-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
offs of any of the stages in the design
problem.
- They must be biased properly taking
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
into account KVL and KCL
constraints. 
- Although they have voltage gains of
 
 
 
 
 
almost one, these stages have a big
 
 
 
   
 
 
effect on the overall voltage gain of the
 
 
 
 
 
 
ampliﬁer because they load the second
 
 
 
 
 
gain stage.
 
- These stages determine the output
 
 
 
 
resistance of the ampliﬁer.
 
 
 
- IBIAS3  and IBIAS4  set the bias levels of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q25  and Q26.  The bias levels of Q28  and 
  
Q29  are set by the γ's. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- A reasonable choice is to make γ28  = γ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
29, and γ25  = [(βn+1)/(βp+1)]γ26,in which 
 
 
 
 
 
case: 
 
IE28/IE25  = γ28/γ25

When both MOSFETs were saturated the voltage on this node could take on

5.	  DC offset of a differential ampli ﬁer (OP-Amp) 
 
 
 
 
Procedure for ﬁnding the DC offset: 
 
III. 	 Knowing the differential voltage gain of the stage, Avd, we can 
 
calculate the DC off-set at the output by subtracting the voltage 
calculated in Step I, which we can call VNODE-I, from the voltage 
calculated in Step II, VNODE-II.
 When vIN1- vIN2  = (VNODE-I  - VNODE-II)/Avd, VOUT  is on the same order 
 
 
 
and thus essentially zero.  We will deﬁne this value of vIN1- vIN2 to 
 
be the DC offset, certainly compared to (VNODE-I  - VNODE-II). 
 

     
 
DC offset = (VNODE-I - VNODE-II)/Avd 

Example:  In the design problem, 
if Avd.turns out to be -1 x 104, 
and (VNODE-I-VNODE-II) is -0.9V, 
then the DC offset is 90 µV.
