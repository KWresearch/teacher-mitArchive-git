Exam 1:  The  first hour  exam  is  scheduled  for Wednesday night, October  7,  from 7:30 
to 9:30 pm Please let me know  as soon as possible ( by e-mail)  if you
have  a  conflict  so  we  can  resolve  it  as  painlessly  as  possible.  The  exam  is  closed 
book  and will  cover  the material  through  10/2/09  and  Problem  Set  #4  (i.e.  through 
p-n  junction  diodes  and  BJT  basics).  A  formula  sheet will  be  provided  (see  below); 
you  can  also  bring  one  two- sided  8.5  x  11  crib  sheet  (and  a  magnifying  glass  if 
necessary).  Old exams and solutions will be posted on Stellar soon. 
Formula  Sheet:  A  draft  copy  of  the  formula  sheet  has  been  posted  on  Stellar. 
Suggestions for additions, corrections, and/or deletions are welcome. 

Problem  1  - The  p- and  n-sides  of  the  silicon  p-n  diode  shown  above  are  each  2  µm wide;
the  depletion  regions  on  either  side  of  the  junction  are  both  much  narrower  than  this 
and their widths can be neglected relative to 2 µm; also, Lmin  >> 2 µm. .  The n-side has a 
net  donor  concentration,  NDn,  of  1016  cm -3.  The  hole  and  electron mobilities,  µh  and  µe,
are  600  cm2/V-s  and  1600  cm2/V-s,  respectively,  throughout  the  device.  (Ignore  any 
dependence of the mobilities on doping level.)  The cross-sectional area is 10-4  cm2.

a) When the bias voltage, VAB, is 0.48 V, what are the following quantities?

iii)	 The  excess  hole  charge  stored  in  the  quasi  neutral  region,  QNR,  on  the  n-side  of 
the diode, qQNR,n-side. 
iv)	 The net hole current density crossing the junction, Jh(0). 
b)  You are  not  told  explicitly  the doping  level  of  the p-side of  this diode, NAp,  but you 
are  told  that  the  total minority carrier  (electron) population at  the  edge of  the depletion 
region  on  the  p-side,  n(-xp)  is  one  tenth  that  of  the  total  minority  carrier  (hole) 
population at xn, p(xn), when the applied voltage, VAB, is 0.48 V, that is p(xn)/n(-xp) = 10. 
i)  What must the net acceptor concentration on the p-side, NAp, be? 
ii)	 What  is  the magnitude of  the  ratio of  the  excess electron  charge,  qQNR,p-side,  stored 
on  the  p-side  of  this  diode  to  the  excess  hole  charge,  qQNR,  n-side,  stored  on  the  n-
side at this bias? 
iii)	 What is the ratio of  the net electron  current density crossing  the  junction,  Je(0),  to 
the net hole current density, Jh(0), at this bias point? 
iv)  What is the total potential step going  from the quasi-neutral region on the p-side 
to the quasi-neutral region on the n-side of the biased junction? 

Problem  2  - This  question  concerns  the  silicon  sample  illustrated  below  which  has  three 
uniformly doped regions:  Regions 1 and 3 are p-type, and Region 2 is n-type.  There 
are ohmic contacts on either end of  the sample, and  there is a contact to Region 2 off
to  the  side  (much  as  it  is  in  a  bipolar  junction  transistor).  Throughout  the  sample 
the electron diffusion coefficient, De, is 40 cm2/s,  the hole diffusion coefficient, Dh,  is 
15 cm2/s, and τmin  ≈ ∞.  The cross-sectional area is 10-4  cm2. 

When  Terminal  2  is  grounded  and  bias  voltages,  V12  and  V32,  are  applied  to  this
device,  the  excess minority  carrier  profiles  shown  at  the  top  of  the  next  page  result
in Regions 2 and 3.  (You have to figure out what happens in Region 1 yourself.) 
You  can  ignore  the widths of  the depletion  regions  for purposes  of working  this
problem.

(a)	 Looking at Junction B: 
(i)	 What  is  JElectron-B,  the  electron  current  density  crossing  Junction  B?  Recall 
that this is the minority carrier diffusion current density in Region 3. 
(ii)	 What is JHole-B, the hole current density crossing Junction B? 
(iii)	 What is the terminal current I3? 
(iv)	 What is NA3, the doping level in Region 3? 
(b)	 Looking at Junction A: 
(i)	 What  is  n’(2−),  the  excess  electron  concentration  at  the  edge  of  the  quasi-
neutral  region on  the p-side of  this  junction,  i.e.  just  to  the  left of  the  edge
of the depletion region at x = 2−? 
(ii)	 What is V12, the voltage bias on Junction A? 
(c)	 Looking  now  at  the  entire  sample,  removing  the  biases  V12  and  V32,  and 
thinking of the structure as a bipolar junction transistor: 
(i)	 What is the best terminal to use as the emitter, and why? 
(ii)	 For  your  choice  of  emitter  above,  what  is  the  forward  current  gain,  βF,  of 
this transistor? 

Problem 3  - You are given a silicon npn bipolar transistor with the following parameters: 
WB = 0.5 µm 
WE = 0.25 µm, 
WC = 1.0 µm 
Active device cross-sectional areas:  AE  = AC  = 10-4  cm2 
Dh  = 10 cm2/s, 
De  = 20 cm2/s 
Minority carrier lifetime, τmin  =  ∞ 
(recombination only at contacts) 
Collector doping, NDC  = 5 x 1016  cm -3 
VA  = 100 V 
A  plot  of  log  iC  and  log  iB  vs  vBE  for  this  device  is  shown  at  the  top  of  the  next 
page.  Such a plot is called a Gummel Plot, after  the researcher who first realized 
that it was a useful  tool  for measuring βF  for BJTs and seeing  if and how  it varies 
with vBE:

a)  What is the forward current gain, βF, in this transistor?

b)  What is the base defect, δB, in this transistor?  (Hint:  No calculation necessary.)

c)  Calculate the ratio, r, defined as r = (wE,eff·NDE)/(wB,eff·NAB).

d)  Calculate the net acceptor concentration in the base, NAB.  (Hint:  Do not use your

answer in Part c.) 
e)  Calculate the net donor concentration in the emitter, NDE. 
f)  Plot  the  excess minority  carrier  profiles  between  x  =  -wE  and  x  =  wB+wC  for  the 
bias  condition  VBE  =  0.7  V,  VBC  =  - 1V.  Label  the  numerical  values  of  the  excess 
minority  carrier  concentrations at  the  edges of  the depletion  regions at x = 0 and 
x  = wB,  and  at  the  contacts.  (Note:  Neglect  the  depletion  region widths  relative
to the emitter, base, and collector widths.) 
g)  Consider  the  total  number  of  excess  minority  carriers  in  the  base  of  this 
transistor, QB,diff, under each of the following two bias conditions, 
Bias A: 
VBE  = 0.7 V 
VBC  = -1 V 
Bias B: 
VBE  = 0.7 V 
VBC  = 0.7 V 
What  is  the  ratio  of  the QB,diff 's  under  the  two bias  conditions?  (Suggestion:  Try 
sketching n'(x) for 0 < x < wB  for each of these biases.)
