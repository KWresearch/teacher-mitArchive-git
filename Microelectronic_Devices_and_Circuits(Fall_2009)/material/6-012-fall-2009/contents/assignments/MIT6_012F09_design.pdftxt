I.  General Comments 
Do not panic when you see the circuit.  It looks overwhelming at first but it is 
made  up  of  simple  building-block  pieces  and  it  is  understandable.  In  addition, 
you  will  be  given  help  along  the  way,  first  by  this  write-up,  and  later  in 
recitations,  lectures,  and  additional  handouts.  At  the  same  time,  the  design
process  you  need  to  go  through  is  a  complex  one  and  it  is  not  one  you  will
successfully  negotiate  in  one  sitting.  Thus  it  is  important  that  you  get  started,
first  developing  an  understanding  of  the  circuit  and  the  nature  of  the  design
challenge, and then at doing your design.  You can do it, but not in one night. 
II.  The Ground Rules 
1.  Consider  this  design  problem more  like  an  open  book  exam,  than  a  problem 
set.  You  are  encouraged  to  consult  references  and  to  seek  guidance  from  the
6.012 staff, and  to discuss design issues with others, but you  should not work on 
your  specific  design  and  write-up  with  any  other  students  or  any  other 
individuals.  Nor should you compare design values or performance results with 
other  students.  The  design  you  submit  must  be  your  own;  any  collaborations
(and they should be minor) should be noted. 
2.  Do  not  let  the  design  slide  until  the  last  week.  Make  a  first  attempt  at  a
solution  early  so  you  can  obtain  any  clarification  and  guidance  you  may  need
from the 6.012 staff before the Thanksgiving holiday (Nov. 26-29). 
3.  You are  required  to  submit a  completed Excel  file  cover  sheet,  and  a detailed
discussion  of  your  design  and  your  approach  to  arriving  at  it.  The  Excel  file 
cover  sheet  will  be  available  on  Stellar.  Your  write-up  should  include  circuit
diagrams  for  your  large  signal  and  incremental  analyses,  and  the  equations  you
used and calculations you made.  It should also include a discussion of the trade-
offs  you  considered  in  your design.  View  the minimum  performance  objectives
as a challenge and try to do even better. 
4.  Make  reasonable  approximations.  Do  not  carry  your  calculations  out  to  any 
more  than  three  (3)  significant  figures.  Your  predicted  performance  values
should also be stated  to no more than three (3) significant figures.  The following 
are  examples  of  numbers  with  three  significant  figures:  1.23,  0.123,  123,  3450, 
0.0345, 6.78 x 109. 

2 

5.  Anyone who does not  submit a design problem  solution which demonstrates
a  reasonable  level  of  effort will  automatically  receive  zero  points  and  a  grade  of
"I"  for  6.012  (as  long  as  their performance  is  otherwise passing).  An  "I"  received 
for  this  reason  can  only  be  completed  by  submitting  an  acceptable  solution  to 
this term's design problem by January 15, 2010.  Late solutions will be checked to
determine  that  they  are  acceptable,  but  will  receive  zero  points  for  purposes  of
determining an overall course grade. 
III.  Design Objective 
Your  design  objective  is  to  specify  transistor  dimensions  for  the  integrated
linear  amplifier  shown  in  Figure  1  on  Page  3  so  that  it  meets  or,  hopefully,
exceeds  the  performance  objectives  itemized  below.  You  are  able  to  increase 
MOSFET gate widths and/or lengths and BJT areas by integer multiples. 
The  circuit,  which  is  described  in  full  detail  in  Section  V,  is  a  BiCMOS
differential  amplifier  designed  to  have  a  large  differential-mode  gain,  large 
common-mode  rejection  ratio,  large  common  mode  input  voltage  range,  and 
large output voltage swing. 
You are to specify the dimensions of the devices in the circuit in Figure 1, and
to  calculate  the  corresponding  bias  levels  and  performance  characteristics.  You 
are  also  expected  to  discuss  the  main  aspects  of  your  design  in  your  solution 
write-up,  and  to  also  discuss  there  the  factors  you  took  into  consideration  in
arriving at your design. 
Performance Objectives:

Small-signal  common-mode  voltage  gain,  Avc,  into  a  50 Ω  load:  as  small 
as possible, and not more than 0.002 
2)  Common-mode rejection ratio, Avd/Avc  : ≥ 5 x 107 
3)  Small-signal output resistance, rout:  ≤ 10 Ω. 
4)  Maximum output voltage swing into a 50 Ω load, |vOUT|max:  ≥ 0.75 V. 
5)  Minimum common-mode input voltage range, |vIC|min:  ≥ 0.75 V. 
6)  Total quiescent power dissipation not to exceed 8.5 mW.

voltage at the output, i.e. vOUT,

when vIN  = 0, in a feedback

circuit like that illustrated to the

right assuming perfect element

matching:  |VOUT| ≤ 20 µV.

IV.  Component Specifications 
Transistors 
A. 
All  of  the MOSFETs  in  this  amplifier  should  be  operated  in  strong  inversion
(as  opposed  to  sub-threshold).  Some  of  the  transistors  in  the  circuit  can  be 
chosen  to  be  the  smallest  devices  that  can  be  made  with  the  fabrication  process
used,  but  others  will  have  to  be  designed  to  be  larger;  this  might  be  done  to
adjust  the  value  of  a  current  source,  for  example,  or  to  maximize  the  gain  of  a 
stage.  In  the  listing below  the properties of  the minimum  size devices are  listed
first and then the scaling rules for designing larger devices are given. 
1.  npn Bipolar Transistors -- The npn transistors are vertical structures that have 
the following large-signal and small-signal (hybrid-π) parameters

up to a factor of 25 times.  Increasing the base-emitter junction area, AE, by 
a  factor  of  γ,  increases  the  current  limits  on  the  operating  range  by  the 
same  factor.  The  emitter-base  diode  saturation  current  in  the  Ebers-Moll 
model,  IES,  increases by  the  same factor,  γ;  so too does  ICS.  No other  static 
model parameters change.

iv)  Operating range:  0.5 µA ≤ IC  ≤ 1.5 mA 
Scaled devices  -- You may  increase the base-emitter  junction area by 
b) 
up to a factor of 25 times.  Increasing the base-emitter junction area, AE, by 
a  factor  of  γ,  increases  the  current  limits  on  the  operating  range  by  the 
same  factor.  The  emitter-base  diode  saturation  current  in  the  Ebers-Moll 
model,  IES,  increases by  the  same factor,  γ;  so too does  ICS.  No other  static 
model parameters change.

the Early voltage increases linearly with L.

the Early voltage increases linearly with L. 
B. Power Supplies 
The  power  supplies  are  ideal  voltage  sources  with  fixed  values  of  1.5  V  and 
-1.5 V relative to ground. 
V. 
Discussion of the Circuit 
You  should  first  look  at  the  circuit  carefully  and  identify  its  various  pieces.
Initially  the  circuit  looks very  complicated but  if  you break  it  into  its  component
parts  and  understand  what  each  does  and  how  they  interact,  you  will  find  that
the amplifier is actually much less formidable. 
Begin by  identifying  the biasing circuitry and the current  sources,  in this case
three  n-channel  MOSFETs  (Q10,  Q19,  and  Q22),  two  p-channel  MOSFETs  (Q1  and 
Q16),  and  two  you  can  choose  to  make  either  n- or  p-channel  (Q2  and  Q3;  you
must  also  specify  where  the  gates  and  substrates  of  these  two  transistors  are
connected). 
The  chain  formed  by Q1,  Q2,  Q3,  and  Q22  determines  the  voltages  at  points  A
and  B,  which  are  used  to  establish  the  gate-to-source  voltages  of  transistors 
functioning  as  current  sources,  Q10,  Q16,  and  Q19.  Specifically,  Q10  functions  as  a 
current  source  that  directly  biases  the  first  stage  (transistors  Q4,  Q5,  Q6,  Q7,  Q8, 

6 

and Q9),  and  indirectly  also biases  the  second stage  (transistors Q11, Q12, Q13, Q13’,
Q14,  and  Q15).  Transistors  Q16  and  Q19  function  as  current  sources  that  are  the 
stage  loads  (non-linear)  of  the  pnp  and  npn  BJT  emitter  follower  stages 
containing transistors Q17  and Q18, respectively; they also bias Q17  and Q18. 
Once you see which transistors are involved in current source biasing you can
mentally replace them with current sources, as we will do in Figure 2, and ignore
those  devices  initially,  and  until  you  have  decided  what  levels  of  bias  current
you need. 
Move on next  to  look at  the  amplifier stages, starting with the  input stage, Q8
and  Q9.  This  stage  is  an  n-channel  MOSFET  common-source  differential  stage,
i.e.,  a  source  coupled  pair,  loaded with  an  active  load  called  the  Lee  Load,  after
Professor  Tom  Lee  of  Stanford  (a  former  6.012  student)  who  invented  it  (not  in 
6.012).  The  Lee  Load  looks  incrementally  like  a  very  large  resistor  for 
differential-mode  inputs,  and  like  a  very  much  smaller  resistor  for  common-
mode  inputs.  The  difference-mode  voltage  gain  is  thus  very  large  and  the 
common-mode  voltage  gain  is  less  than  one  (i.e.,  it  is  not  a  gain,  but  an 
attenuation).  Consequently  using  the  Lee  Load  results  in  a  gain  stage  with  a 
large common-mode rejection ratio. 
The  second  stage  is a  common  source differential  stage  loaded with an active 
load called a current mirror.  By using a p-MOS second gain stage it is possible to
bias  this  stage  directly  from  the  first  stage,  rather  than  the  more  conventional
way  in differential circuits of using a  current  source to bias it.  This increases  the 
positive  output  voltage  swing  significantly,  which  is  important  in  a  circuit  like
this designed to run off only +/-1.5 V voltage supplies. 

Figure  2  - A  simplified  schematic  of  the  design  problem  circuit  drawing
attention  to  some  of  the  functional  units  of  the  circuit.  There  are  four 
stages  in  this  amplifier:  From  left  to  right,  we  find  that  Stage  1  is  an  n-
MOS  common-source  gain  stage  with  a  p-MOS  Lee  Load;  Stage  2  is  a  p-
MOS  common-source  gain  stage  with  an  n-MOS  current  mirror  load; 
Stage  3  is  a  pair  of  emitter-follower  buffer  stages;  and  Stage  4  is  a  bipolar 
push-pull output stage (this is essentially another emitter-follower stage).

The  load  of  the  second  stage  is an  n-MOS  current mirror  load,  and  as  such  it 
does several things:  First, it provides an active load which effectively applies the 
output of  the Q11  to the gate of Q15, so that the output due to the difference-mode 
signal input to Q11  is added to the output due to the difference-mode signal input 
to  Q12.  Doing  this  converts  the  output  from  a  double-ended  (or  differential) 
output to a single-ended output, and does so in such a manner  that we obtain an
additional  factor of  two in gain.  (This is explained  in Section 12.4, pages 392-395 
in  the  Course  Text.)  Second,  the  current mirror  load,  like  that  of  the  Lee  Load, 
looks  different  for  difference-mode  signals  and  common-mode  signals.  As  a 
consequence  the  difference-mode  gain  of  this  stage  is  large.  At  the  same  time, 
the common mode gain of this stage is small. 
The  output  of  the  second  stage  is  taken  from  the  node  joining  the  drains  of 
Q12  and  Q15.  This  node  is  what  is  called  a  “high  impedance”  node.  Ideally  the
voltage on  this node would match  that on  the node  joining  the drains of Q11  and 
Q14,  and  the  voltage  on  this  latter  node  is  known  because  it  is  connected  to  the 
gates of Q14  and Q15.  In  this  circuit you will  find  that  the voltage on  this node  is
much  lower  than  it  should  be  to  achieve  the  specification  that  the  quiescent
output  voltage,  VOUT,  be  0  V.  Consequently,  the  diode-connected  BJTs,  Q13  and 
Q13’,  have  been  inserted  to  increase  the  quiescent  voltage  drain  of  Q12  and  the 
bases of Q17  and Q18. 
The goal  is  to  increase  the quiescent voltage  drain of Q12  as much as  possible 
without  limiting  the  output  voltage  swing,  but  it  is  not  possible,  nor  is  it 
necessary,  to  make  it  high  enough  to  itself  yield  VOUT  =  0  V.  In  practice,  the 
quiescent  value  of  the  voltage  on  the  drain  of Q12  is very  sensitive  to  differences
in  the  transistors  and  process  variations,  and  as  a  practical  matter  it  cannot  be 
predicted  with  certainty.  This  is  a  very  common  situation  in  high  gain
differential  amplifiers  and  the  issue  is  dealt  with  by  using  the  amplifier  with
feedback  that stabilizes the quiescent output  voltage very near  to zero Volts. The 
practical consequence for your analysis is that you can assume that the quiescent
output  voltage  is  zero  volts.  You  should  then  calculate  how  much  of  a 
differential bias voltage  is needed at the  input of your design to make VOUT  ≈ 0 V 
assuming perfect matching (this will be discussed in class). 
The  third  “stage  is  a  pair  of  emitter-follower  stages,  one  that  uses  a  pnp 
BJT and the other that uses an npn BJT.  These followers are coupled to the fourth
and  final  stage, which  is a  complementary output  stage  called  a push-pull  stage. 
This is basically an emitter-follower stage  in which an npn bipolar  transistor  (Q20
in this circuit) drives the load (i.e., supplies current to the  load resistor) when the
output voltage goes above zero, and a pnp bipolar transistor (Q21) drives the load 
when  the  voltage  goes  negative.  With  zero  output  voltage,  all  four  transistors 
are  equally  on.  However,  as  the  output  signal  goes  positive  the  pnp  transistors
are turned off and the npn transistors turn on more strongly supplying current to 
the  load  through Q20.  When  the output goes negative,  the opposite happens and 
the pnp transistor, Q21, turns on strongly drawing current through the load. 
Taken  together  the  last  two  stages  give  the  amplifier  a  low  output 
resistance  and  provide  a  buffer  between  the  50  Ohm  load  and  the  high  gain 
second  stage.  (See  Section  11.3.4,  and  especially  the  discussion  on  Page  345,  in
the Course Text.  This is a different push-pull design than that in the text, but the 
basic  idea  is  the  same.)  The  interactions  with  the  output  stages  and  the  second 

8 

gain  stage  are  particularly  important  to  consider:  First,  Q17  and  Q18  should  be 
sized  and  biased  so  that  there  is  no  bias  current  drawn  from  the  second  stage.
You will  find,  in  fact,  that  the  relative  sizes  of  all  of  the  bipolar  transistors  ( Q17,
Q18,  Q20,  and  Q21)  are  important  when  designing  the  biasing.  Second,  the  input
resistance  of  the  emitter  follower  stages  loads  the  cascode  gain  stage  and  plays
an  important  role  in  limiting  the  gain  of  that  stage.  Third,  the  output  resistance
of  the  amplifier  is  limited  in  part  by  the  output  resistance  of  the  second  gain
stage.  The bias  currents  set by Q20  and Q21  also play  an  important  role  in  setting
the  output  resistance  and  you  will  find  that  there  is  a  clear  trade-off  between 
output  resistance  and  quiescent  power  dissipation.  All  told,  the  output  stages
are perhaps  the most  interesting part of  the  circuit,  as will  become more  clear  as
the design problem circuit is discussed in lecture, recitation, and tutorials. 
VI. 
Starting your Analysis 
As  pointed  out  earlier,  one  of  the  first  things  to  do  is  to  identify  the  various 
sub-circuits  in  the  full  circuit,  i.e.,  the  various  gain  stages,  the  biasing  circuitry, 
etc.  Then  look  at  each  piece  individually  and  understand  what  it  can  do  and 
what  constraints  are  placed  upon  it.  Look  at  each  gain  stage,  for  example,  and 
write  an  expression  for  its  gain.  Try  to  get  a  relationship  that  depends  on  the
bias  level  and device parameters,  and  then  on  any  bounds  on  the  dimensions  of 
the devices,  and  on any  limitations on  the operating  currents and/or voltages of
the devices.  We know  in general,  for  example,  that MOSFET  gain  stages  loaded 
with  non-linear  loads  formed  from  transistors  biased  in  their  constant  current 
regions  (i.e.,  saturation  in  the  case MOSFETs  operated  in  strong  inversion)  tend
to have higher gain when biased at low levels of drain current, that is, with small
values of  (|VGS|- |VT|).  Since  there  is a minimum value  this quantity  can have, 
it will be useful to try to express the gain of the current mirror gain stage in terms 
of  (|VGS|- |VT|)min, and  find what the maximum gain for  the stage can be.  Then 
you  can  begin  to  understand  how  you  must  size  and  bias  the  stage  to  achieve
that gain (or as near to it as possible). 
You  should  also  spend  some  time  understanding  the  output  stages;  in
particular  what  the  output  resistance  depends  upon  and  whether  that  impacts
any  earlier  stage(s),  and  what  constraint  the  output  voltage  swing  specification
implies.  To  analyze  the  final  stage  you  can  assume  that  both  of  the  transistors
are  active  for your  incremental modeling, whereas  for your  large  signal  analysis
of  the maximum output voltage swing, only one of  these transistors will be on at
a time. 
To  help  you  get  started  understanding  the  incremental  behavior  of  the 
amplifier,  partial  small  signal  linear  equivalent  circuits  for  the  amplifier  with
difference- and  common-mode  inputs  respectively  are  shown  in  Figure  3a  and 
3b.  You do not need  to work out  the effective resistances of  the Lee and Current 
Mirror  loads,  but  rather  can  use  the  gain  expressions  you will  be  given  in  class,
but do make sure that you have all the factors of two correctly accounted for, etc.
(i.e., don't apply the equations your are given blindly). 
The  biasing  circuitry  can  be  viewed  as  a  separate  issue  in  terms  of 
understanding  how  it  operates.  Once  you  do  this  you  can  understand  how  to
size  the  various  transistors  to  achieve  the  bias  levels  you  need  based  on  your
understanding  and  analysis  of  the  amplifier  proper.  Of  course,  there  may  be
limitations placed on the bias levels you can achieve that force you to adjust your

(a)  Difference-mode input 

(b)  Common-mode input 
Figure 3  - Partial  linear  equivalent circuits  for  the design problem  circuit  for 
difference-mode  and  common-mode  inputs.  Notice  that  the p-MOS  second 
stage  and  pnp  third  stage  have  been  drawn  with  their  transistors’  source 
and  emitter,  respectively, down, whereas on  the  full  schematic  they  are up.
We can do this in the small signal linear equivalent circuit world because up 
and  down  are  both  ground  (i.e.,  both  the  upper  and  lower  rails  are 
grounds).  Notice  also  that  the  transistors and  loads need  to be  replaced  by
their  linear  equivalent  circuits  to  get  the  complete  linear  equivalent  circuit 
of  the  amplifier,  and  the  factor  of  2  enhancement  from  the  current  mirror
has to be included, but these abstractions help one gain insight. 

designs  for  the  amplifier  stages,  but  by  that  point  your  understanding  of  the
circuits  should  be  such  that  making  any  such  adjustments  is  not  a  major 
calamity; a major pain maybe, but no cause for panic. 
A  second  set  of  things  you  should  do  early  in  your  design  process  is  to  look
through  the  design  specifications  and understand  upon what  each  depends.  As 

vod+-vid+-Q8Q20Q17Q12roQ16roLLdmroCMdmRLOADvoc+-vic+-Q8Q20Q17Q12roQ16roCMcm2roQ10roLLcmRLOAD10 

you  develop  an  understanding  of  the  circuit,  you  can  write  expressions  for  the
various  quantities  specified  (i.e.,  voltage  gains,  input  and  output  resistances,
etc.). 
Once  you  begin  to  understand  the  pieces  and  the  specifications,  make  some
initial design  choices and  see what you get.  You may  find  that  some parts work
just  fine, while others  require major  reworking.  It may  take  several  iterations  to
meet  all  of  the  specifications,  but  the  more  you  understand  the  pieces  and  their
interactions,  and  understand  the  implications  for  the  circuit  of  the  constraints
placed on the sizes and operating ranges of the devices, the more quickly you can
get to the answer and the less of a random walk your effort will seem. 
VII.  Enhancements to the Circuit 
You  are,  of  course,  encouraged  to  design your  circuit  to  surpass  the  design
performance  specifications, particularly  the gain  specs,  by  as much as possible.
In  addition,  you  are  encouraged  to  think  about  (and  discuss  in  your write  up)
ways  that  the  circuit  could  be  improved  beyond  the  present  design,  as well  as
why certain choices were not made  in the design.  You might want to consider,
for example, using MOSFETs in the output stages, and discussing whether they
offer  performance  advantages.  You  could  consider  using  a  cascode  in  the 
second  gain  stage,  which  would  significantly  increase  the  open  circuit  gain  of
that stage, but also considerably increase its output resistance.
