Problem 1 - Two short MOS capacitor problems from the textbook: 
a)	 Do  Problem  9.1  in  the  course  text,  Parts  a,  b ,  c,  and  d,  only.  In  Part  d)  ii)  use  the 
value 1000 cm2/V-s for the electron mobility. 
b)	 Do  Problem  9.8  in  the  course  text.  A MOSFET  connected  as  it  is  in  this  question  is 
simply a MOS capacitor. 

Problem 2 –  We  have  only  plotted  the  net  sheet  charge  densities  and  the  electrostatic 
potential  through  the  MOS  capacitors  we  have  discussed,  but  we  have  not  said 
anything about the electric field.  To address this issue, sketch and label the electric field
through an MOS  capacitor  for biases  corresponding  to  the  five  conditions  illustrated  in
Figure  9.3  (parts  a  thru  f)  on  pages  244  and  245  in  the  course  text.  That  is,  make  the
electric  field  sketches  that  correspond  to  this  set  of  charge  density  and  electrostatic
potential plots. 

Problem 3 –  Consider the two silicon device structures shown in cross-section below: 
Device B: 
Device A: 

Both  of  these  devices  are made  on  p-type  silicon with  a  net  doping  level  of  1017 
cm-3,  and  are  20  µm wide  normal  to  the  page.  The  n+  regions  are  doped  to  1018  cm-3, 
and  the  n+-p  junction  is  1  µm  from  the  top  surface.  The  thin  oxide  is  a  high  quality 

n+p-Si15 µm5 µm GBn+p-SiG20 µmB2 

thermal oxide 16 nm thick, and covers an area 20 µm wide by 15 µm long.  In Device A 
the  n+  region  is  20  µm  wide  by  5  µm  long  and  extends  just  up  to  the  edge  of  the  thin 
oxide, while  in Device B  it is 20 µm wide by 20 µm  long  and extends all  the way under
the thin oxide, as shown in the figure. 
You  may  assume  that  throughout  the  silicon  the  electron  mobility,  µe,  is  1600 
cm2/V-s  and  the  hole  mobility,  µh,  is  600  cm2/V-s  (except  in  an  inversion  layer  in 
which  case  µe  =  600  cm2/V-s  and  µh  =  400  cm2/V-s);  that  the  intrinsic  carrier 
concentration,  ni,  is 1010  cm-3  at  room  temperature;  and  that  the dielectric  constant,  εSi, 
is  10-12  F/cm.  The  dielectric  constant  of  the  oxide,  εox,  is  3  x  10-13  F/cm,  and  the 
electrostatic  potential  of  the  gate  metal  relative  to  intrinsic  Si  is  0.3  V.  (Note:  There  is 
more information here than you need.) 
a) 
i)	 What  is  the  electrostatic  potential  of  the  p-type  silicon,  relative  to  intrinisic
silicon, in thermal equilibrium at room temperature? 
ii)	 What  is  the  built-in  potential  of  the  unbiased  n+-p  junction  at  room 
temperature? 
b)	 What are the flat band voltages, VFB, of  the MOS capacitor structures in Devices A 
and B, respectively? 
The magnitude of  the threshold voltage, |VT|,  for  the MOS structure  is 1 V in one 
of these devices, and 4 V in the other.  Use this information and your knowledge of 
MOS  capacitors  to  deduce  the  magnitude  and  sign  of  VT  for  each  of  these  MOS 
capacitors, i.e., the one made on p-Si and the made on n+-Si. 
d)	 What  is  the  condition  (accumulated,  depleted,  or  inverted)  of  the  semiconductor
surface under  the thin oxide  in each of  these devices with a gate voltage, VGB, of 2 
Volts?  Also  give  the  identity  and  sheet  density  of  any  mobile  holes  or  electrons 
induced at the oxide-silicon interface. 
Problem  4  - This  problem  concerns  the  novel  semiconductor-oxide-semiconductor  (SOS) 
structure  illustrated  at  the  top  of  the  next  page.  The  two  semiconductor  regions  are 
both  p-type  silicon with  a  net  acceptor  concentration  of  1016  cm-3;  the  oxide  is  a  50 nm 
(5 x 10-6  cm)  thick  layer of silicon dioxide.  The dielectric constant of  silicon, εSi,  is 10-12 
F/cm and of silicon dioxide, εox, is 3.5 x 10-13 F/cm.

Use  the  depletion  approximation  model  when  solving  this  problem.  Assume  that  the 
depletion region widths are less than w/2.  The drawing may not be to scale. 
a)  Sketch  and  label  the  electrostatic  potential,  φ(x),  in  this  structure  between  -w/2  and 
+w/2 when vAB = 0 and the structure is in thermal equilibrium.

b)	 A  bias  is  applied  to  this  device  sufficient  to  make  the  electrostatic  potential  at  x  = 
tox/2  equal  to  -φp, where  φp  is  the  thermal  equilibrium  electrostatic  potential  in  the 
p-type  regions,  i.e.,  φ(tox/2)  =  -φp.  We  call  this  the  onset  of  inversion  on  the  right 
side, and name this bias the right-side threshold, VTR. 
(i)  What is the sign of VTR?  Explain your answer. 
(ii)  What  is  the  width  of  the  depletion  region  to  the  right  of  x  =  tox/2  with  this 
applied bias? 
(iii)  What  is  the  condition of  the  left-hand  semiconductor-oxide  interface,  the one  at

x = -tox/2 with this applied bias?

(iv)  What is the value of VTR? 
c)	 Sketch  and  label  the  net  charge  density,  ρ(x),  for  -w/2  <  x  <  w/2  when  the  bias 
voltage, VAB, is VTR + 2 Volts; recall VTR was defined in Part (b).  Be sure to label the 
vertical  axis  and  to  indicate  the  magnitude  of  any  impulses  (i.e.,  sheet  charge
densities). 
d)	 Define  the  left-hand  threshold,  VTL,  of  the  structure  as  the  bias  voltage,  VAB,  at 
which the potential at x = - tox/2  is -φp.  What is VTL?  (You can give your answer in 
terms  of  VTR,  if  you  wish.  Making  use  of  the  mirror  symmetry  of  the  structure
should simplify your calculation.) 
e)	 Consider now a different SOS structure in which the left-hand semiconductor region 
is doped n-type, rather than p-type, with a net donor concentration of 1016  cm-3. 
(i)	 Sketch  the  electrostatic  potential,  φ(x)  for  -w/2  <  x  <  w/2  in  thermal

equilibrium,  i.e., vAB  = 0.  Label  the vertical axes but you do not calculate the

widths of any depletion regions.

(ii)	 Sketch  and  label  the  electrostatic  potential  when  vAB  is  VTR  for  this  new

structure,  where  VTR  has  the  same  definition  as  before  [see  Part  (b)  above],

but will not necessarily have the same value.

(iii)	 What  is  the  value  of  VTL  for  this  new  structure  in  terms  of  VTR  for  this  new

structure, where VTR  and  VTL  have  the  same  definitions  as  earlier?  (Making

use of the inversion symmetry of the problem will simplify your solution.)
