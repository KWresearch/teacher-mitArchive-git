Drift motion:
Holes and electrons acquire a constant net velocity, sx,
proportional to the electric field:

At low and moderate |E|, the mobility, µ, is constant.
At high |E| the velocity saturates and µ deceases.

Drift currents:
Net velocities imply net charge flows, which imply currents:

Note:  Even though the semiconductor is no longer in thermal
equilibrium the hole and electron populations still have their
thermal equilibrium values.

Ohm's law on a microscale states that the drift current density is
linearly proportional to the electric field:

The total drift current is the sum of the hole and electron drift
currents.  Using our early expressions we find:

From this we see obtain our expression for the conductivity:

Drift and conductivity are dominated by the most numerous, or

Having said all of this,…
…it is good to be aware that the mobilities vary with doping
and temperature, but in 6.012 we will
1. use only one value for the hole mobility in Si, and one for the
electron mobility in Si, and will not consider the variation with
doping.  Typically for bulk silicon we use
µh =  600 cm2/V-s
µe = 1600 cm2/V-s 

and  

2.  assume uniform temperature (isothermal) conditions and
room temperature operation, and

3.  only consider velocity saturation when we talk about MOSFET
scaling near the end of the term.

Important facts about  τmin and recombination:
The minority carrier lifetime is a gauge of how quickly excess
carriers recombine in the bulk of a semiconductor sample.
Recombination also occurs at surfaces and contacts.
(Problem x in P.S. #2 deals with estimating the relative importance
of recombination in the bulk relative to that at surfaces and contacts.)
In silicon:
– the minority carrier lifetime is relatively very long,
– the surface recombination can be made negligible, and
– the only significant recombination occurs at ohmic contacts
(Furthermore, the lifetime is zero at a well built ohmic contact, and
any excess carrier reaching a contact immediately recombines, so
the excess population at an ohmic contact is identically zero.)

In most other semiconductors:
– both bulk and surface recombination are likely to be important,
but it is hard to make any further generalizations

Non-uniform doping/excitation:  Diffusion
  When the hole and electron populations are not uniform we have
to add diffusion currents to the drift currents we discussed before.
Diffusion flux (Fick's First Law):
Consider particles m with a concentration distribution, Cm(x).
Their random thermal motion leads to a diffusion flux density:

where Dm is the diffusion constant of the particles.
       Note that the diffusion flux is down the gradient.

Diffusion current:
Diffusion depends only on the random thermal motion of the
particles and has nothing to do with fact that they may be charged.
However, if the particles carry a charge qm, the particle flux is also
an electric current density:

Hole Diffusion Fluxes and Currents:
The hole concentration is p(x,t), each hole carries a charge +q,
and the hole diffusion constant is Dh.  The hole diffusion flux and
current densities are :

Electron Diffusion Fluxes and Currents:
Similarly for electrons using n(x,t), -q, and De :

Continuity Relationships (Fick's Second Law):
Another consequence of non-uniform doping/excitations is that
fluxes can vary in space, leading to concentration increases or
decreases with time:

This effect must be added to generation and recombination when
counting carriers.
