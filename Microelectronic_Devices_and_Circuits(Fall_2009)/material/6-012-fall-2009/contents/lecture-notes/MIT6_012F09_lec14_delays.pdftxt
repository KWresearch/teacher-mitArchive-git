Inverter Switching Transient Analysis


(a) 

(c) 
(b) 
The  generic  inverter  stage  (a)  with  the  non-linear  charge  store  shown  explicitly.
The charging cycle (b), and the discharging cycle (c). 
The charge store will in general be a non-linear function of  the output voltage; so 
too are the currents.  Thus the differential equations we must solve are 
dqN(vOUT)/dt = iCH(vOUT), 
Charging: 
Discharging: 
dqN(vOUT)/dt =  iDCH(vOUT).

These are  in general very complicated and difficult to solve by any means.  If, however, 
the  charge  store  can  be  modeled  as  a  linear  capacitor,  CL  (i.e.,  qN  ≈  CLvOUT),  as 
illustrated below, then we can write, 
dvOUT/dt = iCH(vOUT)/CL 
Charging: 
dvOUT/dt = iDCH(vOUT)/CL 
Discharging: 
These are now differential equations for vOUT(t)  that we should at least be able to solve 
numerically,  if we  can not do  so  analytically.  They  also  show us  the  value of  knowing 
the  size  and  shape  of  iCH  and  iDCH. 
(See  Figure  6.14  in  the  course  text,  and  the
discussion accompanying it, for more on this topic). 

(b) 
(a) 
Charging  (a)  and  discharging  (b)  cycles  with  a  linear  load  capacitor  and  zero
static  load  current.  Note  that  for  MOS  inverters  the  static  current  into  the 
stage load, iSL(vOUT), is zero. 
Finally,  if  the  charge  store  can be modeled as a  linear  capacitor  and  the  charging 
and discharging currents can also be approximated as being constant, then 
τLO→HI  ≈  CL(VHI  - VLO)/ICH, 
τHI→LO  ≈  CL(VHI  - VLO)/IDCH 
We  will  find  that  we  can  use  such  an  approximation  to  advantage  when  we  are
analyzing CMOS inverters.
