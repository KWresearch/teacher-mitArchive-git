MOSFETs in the Sub-threshold Region (i.e. a bit below VT) 
Clifton Fonstad, 10/28/09 

In the depletion approximation for n-channel MOS structures we have neglected the electrons 
beneath  the gate  electrode when  the gate voltage  is  less  than  the  threshold voltage, VT.  We  said 
that  it  is only when  the gate voltage is above threshold  that  they are significant, and  that they are 
then  the dominant  negative  charge under  the gate.  Furthermore, we  say  that  above  threshold  all 
of  the  gate  voltage  in  excess  of  VT  induces  electrons  in  the  channel;  thus  our  model  is  that  the 
*, is 
sheet charge density under the gate, qN

As  MOS  integrated  circuit  technology  has  evolved  to  exploit  smaller  and  smaller  device 
structures,  it  has  become  increasingly  important  in  recent  years  to  look  more  closely  at  the 
minority  carriers present  under  the gate when  the gate voltage  is  less  than  threshold,  i.e.  in what 
is  called  the  “sub-threshold”  region.  These  carriers  cannot  be  totally  neglected,  and  play  an 
important  role  in  device  and  circuit  performance.  At  first  they  were  viewed  primarily  as  a 
problem,  causing  undesirable  “leakage”  currents  and  limiting  circuit  performance.  Now  it  is 
recognized  that  they  also  enable  a  very  useful  mode  of  MOSFET  operation,  and  that  the  sub-
threshold  region  of  operation  is  as  important  as  the  traditional  cut-off,  linear,  and  saturations 
regions of operation. 

To begin our study of the sub-threshold region, we will first quickly review  the electrostatics 
of  the  MOS  capacitor,  and  the  electrostatic  potential  profile  predicted  by  the  depletion 
approximation model.  Then we will use this result to derive a more accurate expression than that 
*  below  threshold,  and  use  the  resulting  expression  to,  among  other  things, 
in  Equation  1  for  qN
assess the assumption  that  the contribution of  the mobile electrons underneath  the gate to  the net 
charge density in the depletion region is negligible compared to the contribution from the ionized 
acceptors.  Finally we will  look  at  the  current-voltage  characteristic  of  a MOSFET  operating  in 
the  sub-threshold  region,  and  merge  it  with  our  earlier  model  so  that  we  then  have  a  model  in 
which  the  mobile  electron  charge  is  taken  into  account  and  the  drain  current  is  no  longer 
identically zero when vGS  is less than VT.

The Electrostatics of the MOS Capacitor with vBC  = 0 

Consider  the MOS  capacitor with vBC  = 0  illustrated  in Figure 1,  the same  structure we used 
when we  first  looked  at  the MOS  capacitor  using  the depletion  approximation.  In  the depletion

approximation,  we  assume  that  Equation  1  holds  and  that  the  net  charge  density  profile,  ρ(x), 
under the gate for VFB  < vGC  < VT  can be approximated as: 

With this assumption, we found that the electrostatic potential profile is: 

This  expression  is  plotted  in  Figure  2,  which  also  continues  the  plot  through  the  oxide  to  the 
gate,  from which  we  can  also  get  the  expression  relating  the  depletion  region  width,  xD,  to  vGB 
and VFB:

inversion, sub-threshold region. 

Equation  4  is  useful  because  it  can  be  solved  explicitly  for  xD,  and  the  result  can  be  used  to 
obtain  an  expression  for  φ(x)  as  a  function  of  vGB.  However,  it  will  turn  out  that  what  is  most 
important to us is φ(0), the value of the potential at the interface, and φ(0) is much easier to relate 
to vGB  than is φ(x) at an arbitrary x.  To do so we first find xD  in terms of 

φ(0): 

Using  this  in  Equation  4  gives  us  an  equation  relating  φ(0)  and  vGB  that  will  be  useful  to  us 
shortly: 

Sub-threshold Electron Sheet Charge Density, vGC  = 0 

Returning  to our original goal, which was to find  the electron population density, n(x), under 
*, we note  that  the Boltzman  relationship 
the gate,  and  then  the  electron  sheet  charge density,  qN
between  the  electrostatic  potential  and  carrier  population  holds  under  the  gate  of  the  MOS 
capacitor in Figure 1 because the current in the x-direction is zero.  Thus we have:

In these equations we use φt  for the thermal voltage, kT/q, and we have indicated the dependency 
on vGB  to  emphasize  that  these populations depend on  the gate voltage  as well  as on position,  x. 
To  obtain  the  Equations  7b  and  8b,  we  have  used  po  =  NA  =  ni  exp(-φp/φt)  to  get  expressions 
explicitly  including  the  quantity  [φ(x,vGB)  - φp],  which  also  appears  in  Eqs.  5  and  6.  Note:  In 
many texts, [φ(0,vGB) - φp] is identified as VB(vGB), the voltage drop between the silicon bulk and 
the oxide-silicon interface, i.e. VB(vGB) ≡ [φ(0,vGB) - φp]. 

*,  by  multiplying  n(x)  by  –q  and 
We  can  calculate  the  electron  sheet  charge  density,  qN
integrating  with  respect  to  x  from  the  interface,  x  =  0,  into  the  silicon  until  x  =  xi,  where  xi  is 
defined as the depth at which φ(x) = 0, and thus where we have n(xi) = p(xi) = ni: 

The end-point x = xi  is used for  the integration because for x > xi, p(x) > n(x) and  the material  is 
still  p-type,  while  for  x  <  xi,  n(x)  >  p(x)  and  the  material  net  n-type  and  is  said  to  be  “weakly 
inverted.”  This  is  actually  a minor  point,  however,  and  not worth  fretting  about,  because  n(x) 
falls off very rapidly with  increasing x, and  the main contributions to  the integral come from  the 
region  near  the  interface  (i.e.  small  x)  where  φ(x)  is  near  φ(0).  The  integral  itself  will  be 
significant  only when φ(0)  approaches –φp, which further  reduces  the  importance of  the  tail,  and 
how far from the interface one integrates.

This  integral  is clearly difficult  to  evaluate,  however, without  resorting  to numerical  techniques, 
a less than optimum  situation.  An alternative  approach  is to make use of our earlier observation 
that the main contribution to the integral occurs near x = 0, and to further note that near x = 0 the 
potential variation with x is nearly linear.  A bit of algebra gives us 

Using  this  approximation  in  the  Eq.  9c  yields  an  analytical  expression  which  does  not  obscure 
the dependences on material properties 

Note that in the range validity, φ(0,vGB) ≤ -φp, corresponds to gate voltages such that vGB  ≤ VT. 

To  see  if  the  sub-threshold  charge  is  large  or  small  relative  to  the  channel  charge  which 
*(vGB)  =  Cox 
*(vGB-VT)],  one  can  evaluate  Eq.  12  for  values  of

weak-inversion  charge  does  not  increase  further  above  threshold,  but  instead  is  pinned  at  the 
value it reaches when vGB  = VT.  (This value is 7.2 x 10-9  Coul/cm2  for  the specific values of NA 
and tox used in Figure 3). 

The  first  thing  to  note  in  Figure  3  is  that  the  range  of  gate  voltages where  the  sub-threshold 
charge  is  significant  in  this  example  is  from  about  50  mV  below  threshold  to  threshold.  Note 
also that neglecting the sub-threshold charge only  leads to a 6 mV error in the threshold, VT, that

would  be  extrapolated  from  a  C-V measurement;  thus,  taking  the  sub-threshold  electron  charge 
into account makes only a very minor correction to the predicted value of 1.43 Volts. 

Another way  to get a feel for  the relative significance, or  insignificance, of  the sub-threshold 
electron  charge  is  to  compare  it  to  the  sheet  charge  in  the  depletion  region  at  threshold,  i.e. 
qNAXD  =  (2εSi|2φp|qNA)1/2.  A  quick  calculation  shows  that  this  charge  is  5.2  x  10-7  coul/cm2,

which is about 70 times larger than qN

Returning  to  our  expression  for  the  charge  under  the  gate  below  threshold,  Eq.  12,  we  next 
*  explicitly  in  terms of vGB.  One way  to do  this 
take the derivation one step further  to express qN
is to return to Eq. 6 and solve it for φ(0,vGB), which yields

Putting this into Eq. 12 clearly won’t lead to an equation that gives one much insight, so it seems 
worthwhile to look into making simplifying approximations before proceeding, particularly since 
we know from Figure 3 that the most important region is the small range of voltages below vGB  = 
VT, i.e. φ(0) = -φp.  Perhaps φ(0) can be modeled satisfactorily as varying linearly with VT. 

To  see  if  a  linear  approximation  is  realistic,  it  is  instructive  to use Eq.  12  to plot φ(0,vGB)  vs 
vGB,  which  has  been  done  in  Figure  4.  Referring  to  this  figure,  it  seems  clear  that  a  linear 
approximation  will  be  pretty  good  when  the  surface  potential  is  much  larger  that  the  bulk 
potential, and that it is reasonable to approximate φ(0,vGB) near vGB  = VT  as 

To evaluate the derivative in this expression we first use Eq. 12 to calculate dvGB/dφ ,

the weak inversion sub-threshold region.

Then we evaluate it at φ(0,vGB) = -φp, labeling the result “n”:

Notice that in writing this expression we have replaced εox/tox  with its equivalent, Cox 
Eq. 16 and using it in Eq. 14 yields the approximate linear expression we seek 

Finally,  we  insert  Eq.  17  into  Eq.  12  getting  a  much  more  manageable  and  instructive 
*(vGB) than we would have gotten using Eq. 13 in Eq. 12 directly.  Using Eq. 17 
expression for qN
we find 

where VT  = VFB  + |2φp| + (2εSiqNA|2φp|)1/2/Cox 
* . 

Equation  18  can  be  simplified  further  by  recognizing  that  e-2φp  =  (NA/ni)2 .  Making  this 
substitution yields 

Still further simplification can be achieved by (VT-vGB)/n  is typically much smaller  than  |2φp|,  so 
we  can  say  [-2φp  –  (VT-vGB)/n]  ≈  -2φp.  Making  this  approximation,  we  see  that  the  square  root

term  in Eq. 19  is the same as the one in Eq. 16 defining n and  that  it  is approximately (n-1) Cox 
*(vGB) as. 
Consequently, we can write qN

*(vGB)  for  two-terminal  MOS  capacitors. 
This  result  concludes  our  derivation  of  qN
Summarizing our  results  thus  far, we find  that accounting  for  the  electrons under  the gate below 
threshold  has  an  arguably  negligible  impact  on  the  electrostatics  of  the  MOS  capacitor.  Its

primary  impact  is  to  require  a  minor  correction  in  the  threshold  voltage  calculation.  The 
situation  will  be  quite  different  in  the  case  of  the  sub-threshold  drain  current  of  a  MOSFET, 
which we will study shortly.  First, however, we must extend our results to include three-terminal 
MOS capacitors, i.e., to the case where vBC  ≠ 0. 

Sub-threshold Electron Sheet Charge Density in a 3-terminal MOS Capacitor, vBC  ≠ 0 

To model  the sub-threshold drain current of a MOSFET, we have to extend our model of  the 
electron population density, n(x), under the gate to  include a bias between the adjacent n+ region 
and  the  channel,  i.e.  to  allow  for  a non-zero vBC, as  shown  in Figure 5.  To understand how  this 
bias,  vBC,  effects  the  electron  population  under  the  gate,  it  is  instructive  to  first  think  about  the 
role  the  n+  region  played  in  establishing  the  electron  population  in  the  two-terminal  MOS 
capacitor  situation we  just  looked  at.  We  in  fact  did not  even mention  the n+  region during our 
derivation, but the n+ region does play a very important role because it supplies the electrons that 
*(vGB<VT).  The n+  region  is a  reservoir  of  electrons, 
are under  the gate below  threshold,  i.e.,  qN
and  those  electrons  spill  out  of  it  into  the  region  under  the  gate when  the  electrostatic  potential 
energy  barrier  confining  the  electrons  to  the  reservoir,  -qΔφ,  is  lowered  by  a  positive  gate 
voltage.  The  barrier  is  lowered  most  near  the  oxide-silicon  interface,  and  most  of  the  carriers 
spill across near that interface, however, at any depth that the barrier is reduced, carriers can spill 
*(vGB)  is  the  total  number  of  electrons  that  can 
across.  What  we  calculated  when  we  found  qN

spill across and into the region under the gate when the voltage on the gate is vGB. 

If  the  n+  region  is  biased  positive  relative  to  the  substrate,  i.e.  when  vBC  <  0,  then  the 
potential  energy of  the  carriers  in  the  reservoir  is  lower  than when vBC  = 0 V.  As a  result fewer 
carriers can  spill  out  of  the  source  and  into  the region under  the gate;  quantitatively,  the number 
that can spill into this region decreases exponentially with |vBC|, i.e. evBC/φt.  Thus Eq. 12 becomes: 

and the equivalent of Eq. 20 is: 

The  substrate  bias,  vBC,  does  not  appear  explicitly  in  Eq.  22,  but  it  does  play  an  important 
role because now both  VT  and n are now functions of vBC: 

and 

When  vBC  <  0,  the  depletion  region  is  wider  near  threshold,  so  n  is  smaller  (near  to  1)  and  the 
threshold voltage, VT, is larger than when vBC  = 0. 

With  the  derivation  of  Eq.  22  we  are  ready  to  find  the  drain  current  of  a  MOSFET  biased 
below threshold and in weak inversion, i.e. in the sub-threshold region. 

The MOSFET Drain Current in the Sub-threshold Region 

In the gradual channel approximation modeling of MOSFET terminal characteristics we have 
done  thus  far we have  said  that  the drain  current  is  identically  zero when  the gate voltage  is  less 
than  the  threshold  voltage,  i.e.  when  vGS  ≤  VT.  As  we  will  soon  see,  the  population  of  mobile 
electrons we have  just  calculated  under  the gate provides a mechanism  for  charge  flow between 
the drain and source even when vGS  ≤ VT, and thus there is in fact a small, non-zero drain current 
through  a MOSFET  biased below  threshold.  This is  significant  because on  an  integrated  circuit 
chip with millions  of  transistors  which  are  supposed  to  be  off  and  therefore  not  dissipating  any

power, a little current flowing through each  transistor can easily add up to be a significant power 
drain,  and  be  a  source  of  serious  heating.  Furthermore  we  will  find  that  a  MOSFET’s 
characteristics  are  well  defined  in  the  sub-threshold  region,  and  are  in  no  way  anomalous  or 
parasitic.  In  fact,  they  have  such  interesting  properties  that  it  is  highly  advantageous  in  a  large 
set of applications to design circuits that operate specifically in the sub-threshold region. 

Consider  the  MOSFET  illustrated  in  Figure  6,  and  suppose  that  it  is  biased  with  a  positive 
drain  voltage,  i.e.  vDS  ≥  0,  and  a  negative  substrate  voltage,  i.e.  vBS  ≤  0.  Suppose  also  that  the

will  spill  into  the  region under  the gate  as we have  just  calculated.  The  same will  be  true  at  the 
drain  end  of  the  gate,  and  if  vDS  =  0  the  electron  population  under  the  gate  will  be  uniform 
because  the  situation  will  be  equivalent  to  that  in  a  3-terminal  MOS  capacitor,  and  the  steady 
state  current will  be  identically  zero.  If  vDS  > 0,  however,  the density of  electrons  that  can  spill 
under the gate at the drain end will be smaller than at the source end by a factor of e-vDS/φt.  Rather 
than  electrons  flowing under  the gate  from  the drain,  the  electrons  spilling  into  the  region under 
the gate  from  the  source will  flow  all  the way under  the gate  and  into  the drain n+  region when 
they  reach  it.  As a  result  there will  be  a net  positive drain  current.  To  calculate  the  size of  this 
drain current, we need to model how the electrons flow under the gate.

p-SiBG+vGSn+Dn+S–vDSvBS+iGiBiD6.012 Supplementary Notes:  MOSFETs in  the Sub-threshold Region (i.e. a bit below VT) 

First,  consider  drift.  There  is  a  voltage  difference  between  the  source  and  the  drain,  but  the 
electric  field  laterally  between  them  is  small  because  the  voltage  between  the  back  contact  and 
the  source,  vBS,  falls across  the depletion region between  the n+  source  and  the p-type  substrate, 
and  the  voltage  between  the  back  contact  and  the  drain,  vBD,  falls  across  the  drain-substrate 
depletion  region.  There  is  thus  negligible  lateral  field  in  the  channel  region  below  threshold  to 
drift any electrons there from source to drain. 

Recognizing  that  drift  is  negligible  below  threshold,  we  see  that  the  mechanism  behind  the 
sub-threshold drain current must be diffusion driven by the electron concentration gradient going 
from the source to drain: 

Since  iD  is  effectively  uni-directional,  i.e.  wholly  y-directed,  and  does  not  depend  on  L,  the 
concentration  gradient  must  be  constant  and  equal  to  the  difference  between  the  end-point 
concentrations divided by L, giving us 

Using Eq.  21, we  see  that  because  the barrier  the electrons  see  at  the drain  is vDS  larger  than  the 
*(y = 0) must be related by: 
*(y = L) and qN
barrier at the source, qN

Using this in Equation 26 we obtain 

Replacing De  with µeφt, Eq. 27 becomes 

To  simplify  things  further,  and  get  a  final  working  expression  for  iD,  we  recognize  the  leading 
terms are Ko, leave out the explicit dependence of n and VT  on vBS, and reorder vGS  and VT:

Finally we can  identify the pre-factor Ko(n-1)φt
write this expression as: 

2  as the sub-threshold saturation current, IS,s-t, and 

This  expression  is  plotted  in  Figure  7  on  a  log-linear  graph,  i.e.  log  iD  vs  vDS,  which  results  in 
equally spaced drain current  traces for equal  increments in vGS-VT.  Exactly  the same plot would 
be obtained for a BJT if log IC  was plotted vs. vCE, for equal increments in vBE., except that rather 
than  increasing  by  a  factor  of  10  for  each  60  mV  increment  in  vBE,  which  is  the  case  for  iC,  iD 
increases by a factor of 10 for each n × 60 mV increment in vGS.

Connecting the Sub-threshold Diffusion and GCA Strong Inversion Drift Models 

The  sub-threshold  drain  current  expression,  Eq.  31,  was  derived  assuming  vGS  ≤  VT,  and  it 
reaches  its  maximum  value,  IS,s-t,  at  vGS  =  VT.  For  larger  vGS,  according  to  the  depletion 
approximation model,  the width of  the depletion region, xD, and  the variation of  the electrostatic 
energy  profile with  x,  stay  fixed.  This  implies  that  the  diffusion  current  between  the  drain  and 
source saturates at  its peak value,  IS,s-t, and  the additional drain current,  iD,  for vGS  > VT  is due to 
carrier drift in the inversion region (i.e., in the channel).  Strictly speaking, then, we should write 
the drain current of an n-channel MOSFET as follows:

Notice that when writing Eq. 32 we assumed that vDS  > 3φt, so (1-evDS/φt) ≈ 1. 

In  practice,  however,  we  seldom  include  IS,s -t  in  the  expressions  for  the  drain  current  in  the 
linear  and  saturation  regions.  To  understand  why  this  is  reasonable  it  is  useful  to  compare  the 
magnitudes of the terms IS,s-t  and Ko(vGS-VT)2/2α.  To do this in a general way we can first notice 
that both of  these terms depend on Ko,  so  it makes  sense normalize them relative to Ko, and  thus 
to  compare  iD(sub-threshold)/Ko  and  iD(strong  inversion)/Ko.  We will  look  in  the  vicinity  of  VT,  and  vary 
(vGS-VT).  That  way  we  don’t  have  to  specify  either  Ko  or  VT,  and  our  results  will  be  more 
general. 

In the sub-threshold region we have 

and above threshold, in strong inversion and saturation, we have 

For  the  sake  of  discussion,  let  us  say  that  we  have  an  n-channel  MOSFET  with  the  same 
MOS capacitor we used  earlier, with NA  = 1018  cm -3  and  tox  = 3 nm, and  that vBS  = 0 and vDS  >> 
φt.  The α (and n) of  this device is 1.25, and  the maximum normalized diffusion current, iD,s-t/Ko, 
is  1.56  x  10-4  V2.  For  comparison,  the  normalized  drift  current  when  vGS  is  just  60  mV  above 
threshold, i.e. (vGS  – VT) = 0.06 V, is almost an order of magnitude larger, 1.5 x 10-3  V2, and it is 
more than two orders of magnitude larger, 1.6 x 10-2  V2, when (vGS  – VT) = 0.2 V. 

If we plot  the sum of  the normalized diffusion and drift currents in  the range VT  ± 0.5 V,  as 
shown  in  Figure  8,  we  can  barely  see  the  diffusion  current  on  a  linear  plot.  We  have  to  look 
much more  closely  to VT, well within VT  ± 0.1 V,  to  see  it,  as  Figure 8b  illustrates.  The  same 
currents are presented  in  a  log-linear  plot  in Figure 9.  In  this plot,  the  exponential  nature of  the 
sub-threshold diffusion current is clear, and so too is the n × 60 mV/decade sub-threshold slope.

FIGURE 9 
The drain current, iD, for gate biases from just below to just above threshold as in Figure 8b, 
but now plotted on a log-linear graph so the nature of the small, sub-threshold current and 
its variation with input voltage, vGS, is more clear. 

The  simple depletion  approximation model we  are using,  our  neglect  of  drift  currents below 
threshold,  and  our  use  of  a  saturated  diffusion  current  above  threshold,  are  all  reasonable 
approximations,  and  are  better  the  further  we  are  above  or  below  threshold.  We  should  expect 
them  to  have  limitations  very  near  threshold,  however,  and  in  particular  we  should  not  demand 
too much  from  them  as we  pass  from  vGS  <  VT  to  vGS  > VT.  The  curves  look  rather  smooth  in 
Figure 8 b,  but we  see  a  slight  kink on  the  log  scale of  Figure 9.  Interestingly,  this kink  can be 
smoothed nicely by using the adjusted threshold in  the saturation current expression, as shown in 
Fig. 9, but  is largely coincidence as the 6 mV  shift came from  looking at  the total gate charge in 
the  sub-threshold  region,  not  the  inversion  layer  in  strong  inversion.  Just  the  same,  our  simple 
models accurately reflect the physics, and do an outstanding job no matter how one looks at it.
