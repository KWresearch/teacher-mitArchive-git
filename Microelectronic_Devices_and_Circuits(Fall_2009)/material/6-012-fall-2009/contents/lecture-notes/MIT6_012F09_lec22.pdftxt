DC off-set at the output of an Operational Amplifier:
 
DC off-set: 
The node between Q12  and Q13  is a high impedance node whose 
 
 
quiescent voltage can only be determined by invoking symmetry.* 
 
The voltage symmetry 
 
says will be at this node. 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
The voltage on these 
 
 
two nodes is equal if 
 
 
 
there is no input, i.e. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vIN1  = vIN2  = 0, and if 
the circuit is truly 
 
 
 
symmetrical/matched. 

This is the high 
 
 
 
 
impedance node. 

Real-world asymmetries 
 
 
 
 
 
mean the voltage on this 
node is unpredictable.

DC off-set: 
The transfer characteristic, 
vOUT vs (vIN1  - vIN2), will not in 
 
 
 
 
general go through the origin, 
i.e., 
vOUT = Avd(vIN1  - vIN2) + VOFFSET 
 
 
In the example in the figure
 
 
 
 
Avd  is -2 x 106, and VOFFSET  is
 
0.1 V. 

In a practice, an Op Amp will be 
used in a feed-back circuit like the 
example shown to the left, and the 
value of vOUT  with vIN  = 0 will be 
 
 
quite small.  For this example (in 
 
 
 
which Avd  = -2 x 106, and VOFFSET  = 
µV. 
0.1 V) vOUT 
is only 0.1
 
 
 
In the D.P. you are asked for this value for your design.

with a relatively large drain current to achieve a large output voltage

- The D.P. output stage 
 
 
involves four emitter fol-
 
 
 
 
lower building blocks 
 
arranged as two parallel 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cascades of two emitter 
follower stages each. 
 
 
- Q20  and Q21  with 
 
 
 
joined sources at 
 
 
 
the output node is 
 
 
called a push-pull, 
 
 
 
or totem pole pair. 
 
 
- They determine the 
 
 
 
 
output resistance of 
the amplifier. 
 
- Ideally the output stage 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
voltage gain is ≈ 1.

Voltage gain: 
 
- The design problem uses a bipolar totem pole.  The gain and linearity 
of this stage depend on the bias level of the totem pole.  The gain is 
higher for with higher bias, but the power dissipation is also. 
To calculate the large signal transfer characteristic
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the bipolar totem pole we begin with vOUT:
 

The emitter currents depend on (vIN  - vOUT):
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

 
Putting this all together, and using IE21  = - IE20, we 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
have: 

 
We can do a spread-sheet solution by picking a 
 
 
 
 
   
 
set of values for (vIN  - vOUT), using the last 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
equation to calculate the vOUT, using this vOUT 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to calculate vIN, and finally plotting vOUT vs 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vIN. 
The results are seen on the next slide.

Voltage gain, cont.: 
 
- With a 50 Ω  load and for several different bias levels we find: 
 

 
The gain and linearity are 
 
 
 
improved by increasing 
 
 
 
the bias current, but the 
 
 
 
 
 
cost is increased power 
 
dissipation. 

 
The Av  is lowest and rout  is highest at the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bias point (i.e., VIN  = VOUT  = 0). rin  to

differences..

The second difference is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that the current mirror

The third difference is that 
 
 
 
 
the stage is not biased

Open circuit time constants (OCTC) recipe: 
 
 
 
 
 
1.	  Pick one Cgd, Cgs, Cµ, Cπ, etc. (call it C1) and assume all others 
 
 
are open circuits. 
2.	  Find the resistance in parallel with C1  and call it R1. 
 
 
3.	  Calculate 1/R1C1  and call it ω1. 
4.	  Repeat this for each of the N different Cgd's, Cgs's, Cµ's, Cπ's, 
 
 
 
etc., in the circuit finding ω1, ω2, ω3, …, ωN. 
 
 
 
 
 
5.	  Define ωHI* as the inverse of the sum of the inverses of the N ω 
i's:
 

 
ωHI* = [Σ(ωi)-1]-1  = [ΣRiCi]-1
 
 
6.	  The true ωHI is similar to, but greater than, ωHI*. 
Observations: 
The OCTC method gives a conservative, low estimate for ωHI. 
The sum of inverses favors the smallest ωi, and thus the 
capacitor with the largest RC product dominates ωHI*.

Short circuit time constants (SCTC) recipe: 
 
 
 
1.	  Pick one CO, CI, CE, etc. (call it C1) and assume all others 
are short circuits. 
2.	  Find the resistance in parallel with C1  and call it R1. 
 
 
3.	  Calculate 1/R1C1  and call it ω1. 
4.	  Repeat this for each of the M different CI's, CO's, CE's, CS's, 
 
 
 
etc., in the circuit finding ω1, ω2, ω3, …, ωM. 
5.	  Define ωLO* as the sum of the M ωj's:
 
ωLO* = [Σ(ωj)] = [Σ(RjCj)-1]
 
6.	  The true ωLO  is similar to, but less than, ωLO*. 
 
Observations: 
The SCTC method gives a conservative, high estimate for ωLO. 
The sum of inverses favors the largest ωj, and thus the 
capacitor with the smallest RC product dominates ωLO*.
