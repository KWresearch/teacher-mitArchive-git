(n-channel MOS used as the example) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Gradual Channel Approximation is the approach typically 
 
 
 
 
 
used to model the drain current in field effect transistors.* 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It assumes that the drain current, iD, consists entirely of carriers 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
flowing in the channel of the device, and is thus proportional 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to the sheet density of carriers at any point and their net 
 
 
average velocity.  It is not a function of y, but its components 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
in general are: 

 
 
In this expression, W is the width of the device, -q  is the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
charge on each electron, n*ch(y)  is sheet electron concentra-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tion in the channel (i.e. electrons/cm2) at y, and  sey(y)  is the net 
electron velocity in the y-direction. 
 
 
 
 
If the electric field is not too large,  sey(y) = -µeEy(y), and

We have: 

 
To eliminate the derivative from this equation we integrate both 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sides with respect to y from the source (y = 0) to the drain (y

respect to vCS  from 0 to vDS, because vCS(0) = 0 to vCS(L) = vDS: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

  
The left hand integral is easy to evaluate; it is simply iDL.  Thus 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we have:

At this point we can do the integral, but it is common to simplify
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the expression of VT(vCS,vBS)  first, to get a more useful result.

Approach #1 - Live with it 
 
 
   
Even though VT(vCS,vBS)  is a non-linear function of vCS, we can 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
still put it in this last equation for iD: 

 
 
and do the integral, obtaining:

work with.  More to the point, we don't have to live with it 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
because it is easy to get very good, approximate solutions 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that are much simpler to work with.

Approach #2 - Ignore it 
 
   
Early on researchers noticed that the difference between VT  at 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
0 and at y, i.e. VT(0,vBS) and VT(vDS,vBS), is small, and that using 
VT(0,vBS) alone gives a result that is still quite accurate and is 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
very easy to use: 

 
The variable, vCS, 
 
 
 
 
is set to 0 in VT. 
 
 

 
This result looks much simpler than the result of Approach #1, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and it is much easier to use in hand calculations.  It is, in 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fact, the one most commonly used by the vast majority of 
engineers.  At the same time, the fact that it was obtained by 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ignoring the dependence of VT  on vCS  is cause for concern, 
 
unless we have a way to judge the validity of our approxima-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tion.  We can get the necessary metric through Approach #3.

Approach #3 - Linearize it (i.e. expand it, keep first order term) 
 
 
   
 
In this approach we leave the variation of VT  with vCS  in, but 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
linearize it by doing a Taylor's series expansion about vCS  = 0:

The point at which iD  reaches its peak value and saturates is

BJT: 
We begin by recognizing that the base width decreases 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with increasing vCE  and writing this dependence to first order 
 
in vCE: 

Then we recall that in a modern BJT the base defect, δB, is 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
negligible and βF  depends primarily on the emitter defect, δE, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and can be written: 

Inserting the base width variation with vCE  into βF  we have:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Thus, in the F.A.R.:

•  Gradual channel approximation for FETs 
General approach 

 
 
MOSFETS in strong inversion 
 
 
 
1.  Ignore 	variation of VT  along channel 
 
2.  Linearize variation of VT  along channel:  introduces α  factor 
  
 
 
•  Additional device model issues 
 
 
The Early Effect:
  
1.   	Base-width modulation in BJTs:  wB(vCE)
 
In the F.A.R.:  iC  ≈ βFo(1 + lvCE)iB
 
   
  
2.	  Channel-length modulation in MOSFETs:  L(vDS)
  
 
 
 
 
In saturation:  iD  ≈ Ko (vGS  – VT)2 [1 + λ(vDS-VDSat)]/2α 
 
 
Charge stores:
 
1. Junction diodes - depletion and diffusion charge
2. BJTs - at EB junction:  depletion and diffusion charge
 
   
    
at CB junction:  depletion charge 
(focus on FAR)
 
 
 
3. MOSFETs - between B and S, D:  depletion charge of n+-p junctions 
between G and S, D, B:  gate charge
