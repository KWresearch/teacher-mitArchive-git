We want to know, 
 
 
"Given Nd  and Na, what are no  and po?" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Two unknowns, no  and po, so we need two equations.

Equation 1 - Charge conservation (the net charge is zero): 
 
 
     

 
First equation 
Equation 2 - Law of Mass Action (the np product is constant in TE): 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
Second equation 
 

Where does this last equation come from? 
The semiconductor is in internal turmoil, with bonds being broken and 
 
reformed continuously: 

We have generation:
 

occurring at a rate G [pairs/cm3-s]:
 

 
 
Clif Fonstad, 9/10/09 

Lecture 1 - Slide 13 
 
     

! q(po"no+Nd+"Na")=0#q(po"no+Nd"Na)! nopo = ni2(T)! Completed bond   " # $   Electron + Hole! Completed bond   " # "   Electron + Hole! Generation rate,G=Gext+go(T)=Gext+gm(T)m"And we have recombination:
 

occurring at a rate R [pairs/cm3-s]:
 

In general we have:
 
 

In thermal equilibrium, dn/dt = 0, dp/dt = 0, n = no, p = po, and Gext  = 0, 
 
 
so: 

 
But, the balance happens on an even finer scale.  The Principle of 
Detailed Balance tells us that each G-R path is in balance: 
 
 

This can only be true if nopo  is constant at fixed temperature, so we 
 
must have: 

 
 
Clif Fonstad, 9/10/09 

Lecture 1 - Slide 14 
 
     

! Electron + Hole   " # "   Completed bond! Recombination rate, R=noporo(T)=noporm(T)m"! dndt=dpdt=G"R=Gext+gm(T)m#"nprm(T)m#! 0=G"R=gm(T)m#"noporm(T)m#$gm(T)m#=noporm(T)m#! gm(T)=noporm(T)   for all m! nopo = ni2(T) 
Another way to get this result is to apply the Law of Mass Action from 
chemistry relating the concentrations of the reactants and products 
in a reaction in thermal equilibrium: 

 
We know [Electron] = no  and [Hole] = po, and recognizing that most 
of the bonds are still completed so [Completed bond] is essentially 
 
a constant*, we have 

Back to our question:  Given N and Nd, what are n and p ?

Equation 2 - Law of Mass Action (the np product is constant in TE):

Clif Fonstad, 9/10/09 

* This requires that no  and po  be less than about 1019  cm-3.

Combine the two 
 
 
equations: 

Solving for no  we find: 
 
 
 
 

Note:  Here we have used 
 
 
 
  

 
This expression simplifies nicely in the two cases we commonly 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
encounter: 

 
Fact of life:  It is almost impossible to find a situation

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which is not covered by one of these two cases.

Ohm's law on a microscale states that the drift current density is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
linearly proportional to the electric field: 

The total drift current is the sum of the hole and electron drift 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
currents.  Using our early expressions we find: 

From this we see obtain our expression for the conductivity:
