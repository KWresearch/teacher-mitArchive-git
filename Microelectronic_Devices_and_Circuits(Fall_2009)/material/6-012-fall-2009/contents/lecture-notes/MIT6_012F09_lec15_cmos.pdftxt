CMOS Gate Delays 
Assume we have a symmetrical CMOS inverter with 
VTn  =  |VTp|  ≡  VT  and Kn  =  Kp. 
Also  assume  that  both  the  n- and  p-channel  devices 
are minimum gate length devices, so 
Ln  = Lp  = Lmin,
Co* xn  = Co* xp  ≡  Co*  x. 
Finally,  assume  µe  =  2  µh,  so  if  we  make  the  p-channel 
device  twice  as  wide  as  the  n-channel  device,  we  get  the 
desired K equality; i.e., 
Wp  =  2 Wn,
Kp  =  Wp  µh Co*  xp  =  2 Wn µe  Co*  xn  =  Kn.

The gate delay of an inverter is the sum of the times it 
takes  the  gate  to  switch  from  a  LO  to  a  HI  output,  and
from  a  HI  to  a  LO  output.  To  estimate  these  times  for  a 
CMOS  gate  we  first  note  that  during  the  LO  to  HI  cycle,
the  load  capacitance,  CL,  is  charged  from  0  V  to  VDD,
which  requires  a  total  charge  of  CL  VDD,  through  the  p-
channel  device.  During  much  of  this  cycle  the  p-channel 
MOSFET will be in saturation with VGS  = -VDD, and so the 
current through it into the load will be 
p (-VDD  + VT) 2  =  K
IL  =  K
p (VDD  - VT) 2

As  the  load  charges  up,  and  the  p-channel  device  comes 
out of saturation, this current will decrease, but for sake of
estimation,  assume  that  it  stays  constant  over  the  entire
charging  cycle.  The  charging  time  will  then  be  the  total
charge divided by this current: 
2 CL VDD 
ΔQ
τLO-HI  = 
I  ≈  Kp(VDD  - VT)2 
During  the HI  to  LO  swing,  this  charge  is  discharged
to  ground  though  the  n-channel  MOSFET.  Again  the 
MOSFET  will  be  in  saturation  initially  with  VGS  =  VDD,
and 
ID  =  K
n (VDD - VT) 2

The  current  will  decrease  once  vOUT  drops  below  (VDD  -
VT)  and  the  transistor  is  no  longer  in  saturation,  but  we
can  again  estimate  τHI-LO  by  assuming  it  stays  constant. 
We find 
2 CL VDD 
τHI-LO  ≈  Kn(VDD  - VT)2 
which is exactly the same since Kn  = Kp.  This symmetry is
important  because  it  gives  us  the  shortest  overall  cycle
time,  and  is  another  reason  to  make  the  K's  equal.  The 
total gate delay is the sum of these two times

To  obtain  the  right-hand  expression  we  have  replaced  Kn 
with  (Wn/Ln) µe  Co*  x, and CL with n(Wp  Lp  + Wn  Ln) Co*  x,
which  is  in  turn  3n Wn  Ln  Co*  x.  Written  this  way  we  can 
readily see the advantage of making Lmin  smaller.
