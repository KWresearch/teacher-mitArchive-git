Observations/Comments: 
     
- Non-linear (current source) loads typically yield much higher gain than 
.max
linear resistors, i.e. VA,eff  >> [IDRSL]
 
 - The bias point is not as important to BJT-type stage gain.
 
 - An SI MOSFET should be biased just above threshold for highest gain.
 - For active loads what increases Avd, decreases Avc. 
 
 
  
 
 
- Making L larger increases VA  proportionately, but at the cost of speed.

For SI-MOSFETs, maximizing the voltage gain (Av  or Avd) requires 
 
minimizing (VGS-VT).  What is the limit? 

Av/VA  is a smooth 
 
curve, so clearly 
(VGS-VT)min  > 2nVt.

In the design problem we 
have a current mirror stage 
that is not biased by a 
current source, but rather 
by the preceding stage*.  It 
 
thus looks like that on the 
right. 

We can do an 
LEC analysis of 
this circuit fairly 
easily.  We start 
with the LEC for 
the left side and 
find vinner:

Transistor Q13  does not 
have a companion on the 
left side of the second DP 
gain stage (the Current 
 
Mirror).  If we ignore the 
Early effect for the large 
signal biasing analysis, 
 
as you have been told to 
do, this is fine.  However, 
 
 
strictly speaking, it is best 
to maintain symmetry and 
thus you should add a 
 
companion transistor, 
Q13', as shown to the 
right.

The limitations of using a simple follower stage* output: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- Using a single source follower as the output stage must be biased 
with a relatively large drain current to achieve a large output voltage 
 
swing, which in turn dissipates a lot of quiescent power.

Comments/Observations: 
- The output resistance is largest around vOUT  = 0.  Here both Q2  and Q5 
 
 
 
 
are active and the output resistance is: 

- One must always make K2/K3  = K5/K4, and 
 
 
in the typical design K3  = K4, and K2 = K5. 
The bias current of Q2  and Q5  is set by IBIAS: 
 
 

 
- |vOUT| vs |vIN| is fairly linear 
over a wide range (see right); 
 
|vGS| increases slowly with |vIN|.

Voltage gain: 
 
- The design problem uses a bipolar totem pole.  The gain and linearity 
of this stage depend on the bias level of the totem pole.  The gain is 
higher for with higher bias, but the power dissipation is also. 
To calculate the large signal transfer characteristic
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the bipolar totem pole we begin with vOUT:
 

The emitter currents depend on (vIN  - vOUT):
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

 
Putting this all together, and using IE21  = - IE20, we 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
have: 

 
We can do a spread-sheet solution by picking a 
 
 
 
 
   
 
set of values for (vIN  - vOUT), using the last 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
equation to calculate the vOUT, using this vOUT 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to calculate vIN, and finally plotting vOUT vs 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vIN. 
The results are seen on the next slide.

The gain and linearity are 
 
 
 
improved by increasing

cost is increased power

Specialty pairings:  Push-pull or Totem Pole in Design Prob.
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Comments/Observations: 
 
- The D.P. output stage 
 
 
involves four emitter fol-
 
 
 
 
lower building blocks 
 
arranged as two parallel 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cascades of two emitter 
follower stages each. 
 
 
 
- Driving the totem 
 
pole in this manner 
 
 
 
 
 
results in a much 
 
larger output 
 
 
voltage range than 
 
is obtained by using 
 
 
 
 
a single follower as 
 
 
was done in our 
 
 
 
 
earlier examples. 
NOTE:  Designing with this output requires paying special attention
  
to the biasing, and calculating the input and output resistances. 
     
The next several slides look at these aspects of the push-pull stage.

A constraint on the bias currents is the total power dissipation 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
specification of 8.5 mW.  This means that the total bias cur-
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
rent must be ≈ 2.8 mA or less (i.e, 3 V x 2.8 mA ≈ 8.5 mW).

Lecture 21 - Diff-Amp Analysis II - Summary
 
 
•  Active loads - Lee load, Current mirror 
 
 
 
 
New CM analysis foils 
 
 
 
•  Specialty stages - useful pairings 
 
 
Source coupled pairs:  MOS
 
 
  
Cascode:  Postponed until Lecture 22
 
  
 
 
Push-pull output:  Emitter followers in vertical chain
 
  
Very low output resistance 
Shared duties for positive and negative output swings 
•  Diff Amp Metrics 
 
Output resistance:  Largest about zero; view as followers in parallel 
  
DC off-set on output:  Nulled out by slight differential mode input 
  
 
 
 
 
  
Power consumption:  Add up the current from the supplies 

Happy Thanksgiving
