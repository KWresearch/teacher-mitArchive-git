- The barrier at the n+-p junction is lowered near the oxide-Si 
 
interface for any vGS  > VFB. 
- The barrier is lowered by φ(x) - φp  for 0 < x < xD.

for a device operating in strong inversion (vGS  > VT) EXCEPT

A transistor circuit, whether digital or analog, is typically 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
connected to several DC power supplies that establish the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
desired DC "bias" currents and voltages throughout it.  It also 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
typically has one or more time varying input signals that 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
result in time varying currents and voltages (one of which is 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the desired output of the circuit) being added to the DC bias 
 
 
 
currents and voltages. 
 
 
 
Each voltage and current in such a circuit thus has a DC bias 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
portion and a signal portion, which add to make the total.  We 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
use the following notation to identify these components and 
 
the total: 

Total:  lower-case 
  
 
 
letter and upper-
 
case subscript. 

Bias:  upper-case
  
 
 
letter and subscript. 

Signal:  lower-case 
  
  
 
letter and  subscript.

To construct linear amplifiers and other linear signal process-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ing circuits from non-linear electronic devices we must use 
 
 
 
 
 
regions in the non-linear characteristics that are locally linear 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
over useful current and voltage ranges, and operate there. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To accomplish this we must design the circuit so that the DC 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
voltages and currents throughout it "bias" all the devices in 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the circuit into their desired regions, e.g. yield the proper 
bias currents and voltages: 
 
 
 
 
and 
 
 
This design is done with the signal inputs set to zero and using 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the large signal static device models we have developed for 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the non-linear devices we studied:  diodes, BJTs, MOSFETs. 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Working with these models to get the bias values, though not 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
onerous, can be tedious.  It is not something we want to have 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
to do to find voltages and currents when the signal inputs are 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
applied.  Instead we use linear equivalent circuits .

After biasing each non-linear devices at the proper point the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
signal currents and voltages throughout the circuit will be 
 
 
 
 
 
 
linearly related for small enough input signals.  To calculate 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
how they are related, we make use of the linear equivalent 
 
 
 
circuit (LEC) of our circuit. 
 
 
 
 
 
The LEC of any circuit is a combination of linear circuit 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
elements (resistors, capacitors, inductors, and dependent 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sources) that correctly models and predicts the first-order 
 
 
 
 
 
 
changes in the currents and voltages throughout the circuit 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
when the input signals change. 
 
 
A circuit model that represents the proper first order linear 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
relationships between the signal currents and voltages in a 
 
 
 
 
 
non-linear device is call an LEC for that device. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our next objective is to develop LECs for each of the non-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
linear devices we have studied:  diodes, BJTs biased in 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
their forward active region (FAR), and MOSFETs biased in 
 
 
 
 
 
their sub-threshold and strong inversion FARs.

Creating a linear equivalent circuit, LEC:
 
Consider a device with three terminals, X, Y, and Z: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Suppose, as is our situation with the large signal device models 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we have developed in 6.012, that we have expressions for the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
currents into terminals X and Y in terms of the voltages vXZ 
 
 
and vYZ: 

 
and that we similarly have expressions for the charge stores 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
associated with terminals X and Y:

We begin with our static model expressions for the terminal

them about a bias point, Q, defined as a specific set of vXZ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and vYZ  that we write, using our notation, as VXZ  and VYZ 
 
 
 
For example, for the current into terminal X we have: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

For sufficiently small* (vXZ-VXZ) and (vYZ-VYZ), the second
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and higher order terms are negligible, and we have:

Next we define: 
 
 

 
Replacing the partial derivatives with the conductances we have 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
defined, gives us our working form of the linear equation relating
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the incremental variables:

#2 - The device-specific nature of an LEC is manifested in the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
dependences of the element values on the bias currents 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and voltages, rather than in the topology of the LEC. Thus, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
different devices may have LECs that look the same.  (For 
example, the BJ and FET LECs may look similar, but some of the 
 
 
elements depend much differently on the bias point values.)

For the high frequency model we
 
 
 
 
linearize and add the charge
 
 
 
 
 
stores associated with each pair 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of terminals.
 
Two, qSB  and qDB, are depletion 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
region charge stores associated 
 
 
 
with the n+ regions of the source

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
and drain.  They are relatively 

 
 
straightforward compared to qG., as we will see below.  qSB 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and qDB  contribute two capacitors, Csb  and Cdb, to our LEC. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The gate charge, qG, depends in general on vGS, vDS, and vGB 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(= vGS-vBS), but in saturation, qG  only depends on vGS  and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vGB  (i.e. vGS and vBS) in our model, adding Cgs  and Cgb. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
   
When vGS ≥ VT  the drain is ideally decoupled from the gate , 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
but in any real device there is fringing capacitance between 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the gate electrode and the drain diffusion that we must 
 
 
 
 
 
include as Cgd, a parasitic element.

LEC for MOSFETs in saturation when vbs  = 0: 
 
 
 
A very common situation in many circuits is that there is 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
no signal applied between on the base, i.e. vbs  = 0 (even 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
though it may be biased relative to the source, VBS  ≠ 0 ). 
 
 
 
In this case the MOSFET LEC simplifies significantly: 
 
 
 
 

 
 
The elements that remain retain their original dependences:

Our large signal model for MOSFETs operated in the sub-

Like a MOSFET in saturation with vbs  = 0, the LEC has only 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
two elements, gm  and go, but now gm  is quite different:

The LEC for MOSFETs in sub-threshold FAR (vDS  >> kT/q)

The charge store qDB  is the same 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as qDB in a MOSFETs operated

not.  gG  is the gate capacitance 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
in depletion (VFB < vGB < VT), so it 
 
 
 
 
 
is smaller in sub-threshold.

A very important observation is that all of the elements in 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the three LECs we compared depend on the bias level of 
 
 
 
 
the output current, IC, in the case of a BJT, or ID, in the

Bias dependences: 
 

 
ST = sub-threshold

The bias circuitry is a key part of any linear amplifier.  The 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
designer must establish a stable bias point for all the 
transistors in the amplifier to insure that the gain remains
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
constant and stable. 
 
We will study amplifier design and practice beginning with
