An effect we didn't put into our large signal model 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Base width modulation - the Early effect and Early voltage: 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The width of the depletion region at the B-C junction increases as vCE 
 
increases and the effective base width, wB,eff, gets smaller, thereby 
 
 
increasing β and, in turn, iC.

To minimize the Early effect we make NDC  < NAB 
 
 
•  We will take this effect into account in our small signal  LEC modeling. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Punch through - base width modulation taken to the limit 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When the depletion region at the B-C junction extends all the way
through the base to the emitter, IC  increases uncontrolably. 
 
Punch through has a similar effect on the characteristics to that of

Light emitting diodes:  what they are all about 
The basic idea 
 
 
 
In Si p-n diodes and BJTs we make heavy use of the very long
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
minority carrier lifetimes in silicon, but in LEDs we want all the
 
excess carriers to recombination, and to do so creating a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
photon of light.  We want asymmetrical long-base operation:

Light emitting diodes:  historical perspective
 

 
LEDs are a very old device, and were the first commercial
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compound semiconductor devices in the marketplace.  Red, 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
amber, and green LEDs (but not blue) were sold in the 1960's, but
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the main opto research focus was on laser diodes; little LED 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
research in universities was done for many years. 
 
 
 
__________________________ 
 
Then…things changed dramatically in the mid-1990's: 
 
 
 
 
In part because of new materials developed for red and blue lasers 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(AlInGaP/GaAs, GaInAlN/GaN) 
In part because of packaging innovations 
 
 
 
 
 
(Improved heat sinking and advanced reflector designs) 
In part due to advances in wafer bonding 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Transparent substrates for improved light extraction) 
 
In part due to the diligence of LED researchers 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Taking advantage of advances in other fields) 

Clif Fonstad, 10/6/09 

Lecture 8  - Slide 20 

Light emitting diodes - design issues 

Significant challenges in making LEDs include:
 

1.  Choosing the right semiconductor(s) 
 
 
- efficient radiative recombination of excess carriers 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- emission at the right wavelength (color) 
 
 
 

2.  Getting the light out of the semiconductor
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- overcoming total internal reflection and reabsorption 

3.  Packaging the diode 
 
- good light extraction and beam shaping 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- good heat sinking (for high intensity applications)

Light emitting diodes:  fighting total internal reflection 
  
 
 
 
 
With an index of refraction ≈ 3.5, the angle for total internal 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
     
 
reflection is only 16˚. 
 
*
(Only 2% gets out the top!**) 
Total internal reflection can be alleviated somewhat if the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
device is packaged in a domed shaped, high index plastic 
 
package: 

 
(With ndome = 2.2, 
10% gets out the top!**) 

If the device is fabricated with a substrate that is transparent 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to the emitted radiation, then light can be extracted from 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the 4 sides and bottom of the device, as well as the top. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Increases the extraction efficiency by a factor of 6!
