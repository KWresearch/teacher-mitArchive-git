To treat non-uniformly doped materials we begin by looking at
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
them in thermal equilibrium, as we've said. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This is useful because in thermal equilibrium we must have: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Consequently, the 2 continuity equations in our 5 equations

(an aside) 
 
What do these equations say? 

To see, consider what they tell us about the ratio of the hole 
concentration at x2, where the electrostatic potential is φ2, and 
that at x1, φ1: 
 

The thermal energy is kT, and the change in potential energy of a 
 
 
 
hole moved from x1  to x2  is q(φ2 - φ1), so have: 

If the potential energy is higher at x2, than at x1, then the population 
 
is lower at x2  by a factor e-ΔPE/kT. 
That is, the population is lower at the top of a potential hill. 
If the potential energy is lower, then the population is higher. 
That is, the population is, conversely, higher at the bottom of a potential hill.

(continuing the aside) 
     
 
 
 
The factor e-ΔPE/kT  is called a Boltzman factor.  It is a factor 
 
relating the population densities of particles in many 
situations, such as gas molecules in an ideal gas under the 
influence of gravity (i.e, the air above the surface of the earth) 
and conduction electrons and holes in a semiconductor.* 
The potential energy difference for holes is qΔφ, while that for 
electrons is -qΔφ.  Thus when we look at the electron and hole 
populations at a point where the electrostatic potential is φ, 
relative to those where the potential is zero (and both 
populations are ni) we have: 

We will return to this picture of populations on either side of a 
potential hill when we examine at the minority carrier 
populations on either side of a biased p-n junction. 

Clif Fonstad, 9/17/09 

 
* Until the doping levels are very high, in which case the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Boltzman factor must be replaced by a Fermi factor.** 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
** Don’t worry about it.

I.  D to µ conversions, and visa versa 
 
 
 
 
To convert between D and µ it is convenient to say 
    
 
 
 
in which case q/kT ≈ 40 V-1:

II. Relating φ  to n and p, and visa versa 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To calculate φ knowing n or p it is better to say that  kT/q  26 mV,
    
 
≈ 
 
because then (kT/q)ln10 ≈ 60 mV: 
 
 
28˚C/83˚F 
 
Example 1:  n-type,  ND  = Nd  - Na  = 1016  cm-3 
 
 
   
 

Example 2:  p-type,  NA  = Na  - Nd  = 1017  cm-3 
 
 
 
 
   

Example 3:  60 mV rule: 
 
For every order of magnitude the doping is above (below) ni, 
the potential increases (decreases) by 60 meV.

Non-uniform doping in thermal equilibrium,cont: 
 
 
We have reduced our problem to solving one equation for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
one unknown, in this case φ(x): 
 
 
 
 
 

Once we find  φ(x) we can find no  and po  from: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 

Solving Poisson’s equation for φ(x) is in general non-trivial,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and for precise answers a "Poisson Solver" program must
 
 
 
be employed.  However, in two special cases we can find
 
  
 
 
 
 
very useful, insightful approximate analytical solutions: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Case I:  Abrupt changes from p- to n-type (i.e., junctions) 
 
 
 
 
 
  
also:	  surfaces (Si to air or other insulator)

Abrupt p-n Junctions:  the general strategy 
 
  
 
 
We have to solve an non-linear, second order differential 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
equation for φ: 

 
 
 
In the case of an abrupt p-n junction we have a pretty good
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
idea of what ρ(x) must look like, and we know the details 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
will be lost anyway after integrating twice, so we can try 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the following iteration strategy: 
 
Guess a starting ρ(x). 
 
 
 
Integrated once to get E(x), and again to get φ(x). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use φ(x) to ﬁnd po(x), no(x), and, ultimately, a new ρ(x). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Compare the new ρ(x) to the starting ρ(x). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- If it is not close enough, use the new ρ(x) to iterate again. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- If it is close enough, quit.

To figure out a good first guess for ρ(x), look at how quickly 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
no  and po  must change by looking first at how φ changes: 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
φ(x)  60 mV

φn 

700 to 900 mV 

φp

means for ρ(x):

A 60 mV change in  φ 
decreases no  and po 
10x and ρ  increases to 
90% of its final value. 
The change in ρ  must 
be much more abrupt!

The observation that ρ changes a lot, when φ changes
   
   
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a little, is the key to the depletion approximation.

Lecture 3 - Solving The Five Equations - Summary
 
 
• Non-uniform excitation in non-uniform samples
 
  
 
The 5 unkowns:  n(x,t), p(x,t), Je(x,t), Jh(x,t), E(x,t) 
 
 
 
 
The 5 equations:  coupled, non-linear differential equations 
  
• Special cases we can solve (approximately)
Carrier concentrations: 
 
 
 
Drift:  Jdrift  = Je,drift  + Jh,drift  = q (µe  no  + µh  po) E = σo E 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Low level optical injection:  dn'/dt – n'/tmin  ≈ gL(t) 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Doping profile problems:  junctions and interfaces 
 
Non-uniform injection:  QNR flow problems 
  
• Using the hand solutions to model devices 
 
 
pn Diodes:  two flow problems and a depl. approx. 
  
 
BJTs:  three flow problems and two depl. approx.’s 
  
 
  
MOSFETs:  three depl. approx.’s and one drift 
 
• Non-uniform doping in T.E.
 
 
Relating no, po, and electrostatic potential, φ
