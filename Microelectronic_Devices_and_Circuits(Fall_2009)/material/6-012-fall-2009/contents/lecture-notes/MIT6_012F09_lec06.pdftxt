The steady state diffusion equation in p-type material is:

   and for n-type material it is:

In writing these expressions we have introduced Le and Lh,
the minority carrier diffusion lengths for holes and
electrons, as:

We'll see that the minority carrier diffusion length tells us how
far the average minority carrier diffuses before it recombines.
In a basic p-n diode, we have gL = 0 which means we only need
the homogenous solutions, i.e. expressions that satisfy:
  n-side:
        p-side:

We seldom care about this general result.  Instead, we find
that most diodes fall into one of two cases:
 Case I - Long-base diode:   wn >> Lh
Case II - Short-base diode:   Lh >> wn

Case I:  When wn >> Lh, which is the situation in an LED, for
example, the solution is

This profile decays from p'(xn) to 0 exponentially as e-x//Lh.

  The corresponding hole current for xn ≤ x ≤ wn in Case I is

The current decays to zero also, indicating that all of the excess
minority carriers have recombined before getting to the contact.

Case II:  When Lh >> wn, which is the situation in integrated
Si diodes, for example, the differential equation simplifies
to:

We see immediately that p'(x) is linear:

Fitting the boundary conditions we find:

This profile is a straight line, decreasing from p'(xn) at xn to 0 at wn.
In Case II the current is constant for xn ≤ x ≤ wn:

The constant current indicates that no carriers recombine
before reaching the contact.

The four other unknowns
⇒ In n-type the steady state diffusion equation gives p’.
⇒ Knowing p', we can easily get n’, Je, Jh, and Ex:
Note:  In Lec 5 we saw this
for a p-type sample.

First find Jh:

Then find Je:

Next find Ex:

Then find n’:

Finally, go back and check that all of the five conditions are
met by the solution.
   Once we solve the diffusion equation and get
the minority carrier excess we know everything.

There are two pieces to the problem:
• Minority carrier flow in the QNRs is what limits the current.
• Carrier equilibrium across the SCR determines n'(-xp) and p'(xn), the
boundary conditions of the QNR minority carrier flow problems.

Lecture 6  - Slide 9

….and knowing n'(x) for -wp<x<-xp, and p'(x) for xn<x<wn, we can

           …but first we need to know n'(-xp,vAB) and p'(xn,vAB).

We propose that the majority carrier populations on either side
are still related by the Boltzman factor,* which is now:
exp[-q(φb-vAB)/kT]
Thus:

Under low level injection conditions, the majority carrier
population is unchanged, so p(-xp) remains NAp, so:

And the excess population we seek is:

Similarly at -xp:

Clif Fonstad, 9/29/09

*  We are assuming that the majority carriers can get across
the SCL much faster than they can diffuse away as minority
carriers,  i.e., that diffusion is the bottleneck!

What is the current, iD?
Knowing p’(xn) and n’(-xp), we know:

But we still don’t know the total current because we don’t
know both currents at the same position, x:

Have to be at same “x”

To proceed we make the assumption that there is negligible
recombination of holes and electrons  in the depletion
region, so what goes in comes out and:

With this assumption, we can write:

What is the current, iD, cont,?
Both Jh(xn) and Je(-xp), are proportional to p’(xn) and n’(-xp),
respectively, which in turn are both proportional to (eqv/kT -1):

Thus the diode current is also proportional to (eqv/kT -1):

    (IS is called the reverse saturation current of the diode.)

** Notice:  The non-linearity, i.e., the exponential dependence of the
diode current on voltage, arises because of the exponential
dependence of the minority carrier populations the edges of the
space charge layer (depletion region).  The flow problems
themselves are linear.

Lecture 6 - p-n Junctions:  I-V Relationship - Summary
• I-V relationship for an abrupt p-n junction
Focus is on minority carrier diffusion on either side of SCL
Voltage across SCL sets excess populations -xp and xn:
n'(-xp) = nnoe-q[fb – vAB]/kT-npo = npo(eqvAB/kT-1) = (ni
2/NAp)(eqvAB/kT -1)
 p'(xn) = ppoe-q[fb – vAB]/kT-pno = pno(eqvAB/kT-1) = (ni

Flow problems in QNR regions give minority currents:
   Je(-wp<x<-xp) = q(De/Le)[cosh(wp-x)/sinh(wp-xp)](ni
2/NAp)(eqvAB/kT -1)
     Jh(xn<x<wn) = q(Dh/Lh)[cosh(wn-x)/sinh(wn-xn)](ni

Total current is found from continuity across SCL:

If Lh >> wn, then wn* ≈ (wn - xn), and if Lh << wn, then wn* ≈ Lh
• Features and limitations of the model
Exponential dependence enters via boundary conditions
Injection is predominantly into more lightly doped side
Saturation current, IS, goes down as doping levels go up
Limits: 1. SCL g-r may dominate at low current levels
2. Series resistance may reduce junction voltage at high currents
3. Junction may breakdown (conduct) at large reverse bias
