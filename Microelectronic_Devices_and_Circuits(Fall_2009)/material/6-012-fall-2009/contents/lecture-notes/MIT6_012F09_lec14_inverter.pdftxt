Inverter Analysis and Design 
The  inverter  stage  is a basic building block  for digital  logic  circuits and memory 
cells.  A generic inverter stage is illustrated below on the  left.  It consists of  two devices, 
a  pull-up  device,  which  is  typically  either  a  bipolar  junction  transistor  or  an 
enhancement  mode  field  effect  transistor,  and  a  pull-down  device,  which  might  be
another  transistor,  or  a  resistor,  current  source,  diode,  etc.  The  stage  load  which  is 
shown  in  the  figure  represents  the  input  resistance  of  the  following  stage,  which  is
typically a stage (or n stages) just like the original stage. 

(a)  A generic inverter stage 
(b)  The static currents to calculate vOUT(vIN) 
An  important  piece  of  information  about  an  inverter  stage  is  its  static  transfer 
characteristic,  vOUT(vIN).  To  calculate  this  characteristic  we  sum  the  currents  into  the 
output  node  of  the  inverter,  as  is  illustrated  above  on  the  right.  With  all  of  these 
currents written as functions of vIN  and vOUT, this sum yields the desired relationship: 
iPU(vIN, vOUT)  =  iPD(vIN, vOUT)  +  iSL(vOUT) 
As  an  example,  consider  the  MOSFET  inverter  circuit  shown  at  the  top  of  the
next page with an n-channel MOSFET pull-down and  a  resistor pull-up.  The MOSFET 
is  characterized  by  its  K-value  and  by  its  threshold  voltage,  VT  (we  will  assume  for 
simplicity  that  α  is  1).  To  analyze  this  circuit  we  not  first  that  with  a  MOSFET  pull-
down, the static input current is zero and if the stage output is connected to the input of
a  similar  stage,  the  static  stage  load  current will also be  zero,  and  the  equation above  is 
simply  iPU  =  iPD.  With  a  resistor  pull-up,  the  pull-up  current,  iPU,  is  (VDD  - vOUT)/R 
and  the pull-down current,  iPD,  is the MOSFET drain current.  This current depends on 
the  gate-to-source  voltage,  vGS,  which  is  the  same  as  vIN,  and  the  drain-to-source 
voltage,  vDS, which  is  the  same  as vOUT.  With vIN  less  than VT,  the pull-down  current 
is  zero  and  vOUT  is  VDD.  As  vIN  increases  past  VT,  vOUT  will  initially  be  larger  than

is found by setting iPD  equal to iPU: 
iPU  =  iPD

Substituting yields 

(VDD  - vOUT)/R  =  K(vIN  - VT)2/2 

which we solve for vOUT 

vOUT = VDD  - RK(vIN - VT)2/2 
Clearly  vOUT  decreases  as  vIN  increases.  When  vOUT  reaches  vIN  - VT,  the  pull-down 
goes from saturation to the  linear region and iPD  changes to K(vIN  - VT  - vOUT/2)vOUT, 
and the desired relationship is found by solving the quadratic 
(VDD  - vOUT)/R  =  K(vIN  - VT  - vOUT/2)vOUT 
The  resulting  transfer  characteristic  is  plotted  in  the  course  text  in  Figure  15.8.  Curves
for other pull-up devices are also shown in this section of the text. 
We  can  identify  six  features  of  a  given  inverter  design  which  we  can  use  to
evaluate it and compare it to other designs.  They are: 
1.  The logic levels, VHI, and VLO 
2.  The noise margins
3.  The switching times, τHI→LO, and τLO→HI 
4.  The power dissipation
5.  The fan-out and fan-in sensitivities 
6.  The manufacturability

applied  to  the  input of  an  inverter results  in an output of VLO,  and  that VLO  applied  to 
the  input  of  an  inverter  results  in  an  output  of  VHI.  Mathematically,  if  the  transfer 
characteristic  is  vOUT  =  f(vIN),  we  must  find  the  solutions  to  the  equation  vOUT  = 
f(f(vOUT)).  For  useful  inverter  stages  there will  be  three  solutions  to  this  equation,  but
only  the  largest  and  smallest  values  are  valid;  the middle  solution  is  unstable  and will
not be realized  in practice.  VHI  and VLO  are often most easily  found with the aid of the
graphical technique shown in Figure 15.5 of the course text. 
To  determine  the  switching  times  we  must  first  recognize  that  the  reason  an
inverter output does not instantaneously change  in response to an change of  its input is
because  there  is  charge  stored  on  the  output  node  (on  the  gate  of  the  load  stage,  for 
example,  if  we  are  discussing  inverters  with  MOSFET  pull-downs  as  in  our  earlier 
example).  This is illustrated below: 

The generic inverter stage with the non-linear charge store shown explicitly. 
When  the  input  is  switched  from  VHI  to  VLO,  the  pull  down  device  typically 
turns off (so iPD = 0), and the output switches from VLO  to VHI.  When this happens the
output  node  must  be  charged  up,  and  this  charge  is  supplied  by  the  pull-up  device. 
This  was  illustrated  on  the  left  in  the  next  figure.  The  charging  current,  iCH,  which  is 
dqN/dt, is the difference between iPU  and iSL (assuming as is usually the case that iPD  = 
0): 
iCH ≈ iPU  - iSL =  dqN/dt 
The  larger  this  current,  the  faster  the  charge  store  changes,  and  the  faster  the  output
switches.  (Note  that  the  corresponding  statements  can  be made  about  the  discharging
cycle shown on the right in the figure.) 
In general the charge stored on the output node, qN, will be a non-linear function 
of  vOUT,  and  it  will  not  be  possible  to  calculate  vOUT(t)  and  determine  the  switching 
time  analytically.  There  are  two  cases  in  which  we  can  calculate  the  switching  time,

other of these to cases, we can estimate the switching time analytically. 
The  first  special  case  is  when  the  charging  (or  discharging)  current  is  constant.
We  can  calculate  the  change  in  the  amount  of  stored  charge when  vOUT  changes  from 
VLO  to VHI, and knowing this the charging time is simply this charge divided by the

charging  current, which we  have  approximated  as  being  constant,  ICH  (we  can  say  the 
same about the discharge cycle): 
τLO→HI  ≈  ΔqN/ICH,  and  τHI→LO  ≈  - ΔqN/IDCH 
[Note:  frequently designers do not require that the node be completely charged, but say
the  node  has  switched  when  90%  of  the  store  has  been  built  up  (in  which  case,  of 
course, ΔqN  is replaced by 0.9 ΔqN]. 
The second special case is if the charge store can be modeled as a linear capacitor, 
CL  (i.e., qN ≈ CLvOUT).  Then we can write 
dvOUT/dt = iCH(vOUT)/CL 
to  get  a  differential  equation  for  vOUT(t).  We  should  be  able  to  solve  this  equation 
numerically, if we can not do so analytically. 
If  the  charge  store  can  be  modeled  as  a  linear  capacitor  and  the  charging  and 
dischargind currents can be modeled as constant, then 
τLO→HI  ≈  CL(VHI  - VLO)/ICH,  and  τHI→LO  ≈  CL(VHI  - VLO)/IDCH

VLOvIN = VHIWe have  already  included  the  transient when  the  input  is  switched  from VLO  to 
VHI  in our discussion, but just to make sure this is clear, in this part of the cycle, the pull
down  device  turns  on  and  the  output  switches  from  VHI  to  VLO.  The  most  important
difference  is  that  the  charge  store  now  discharges  and  does  so  through  the  pull-down 
device.  The  pull-down  device  must  conduct  this  discharge  current  and  the  current
flowing  through  the  pull-up  device  (less  that  into  the  stage  load).  In  this  case,  a  large 
pull-up  device  current  is  not  desirable  because  it  makes  this  switching  time  long, 
whereas a large pull-up current makes the other switching time short. 
In  practice  one  usually wants  to minimize  the  sum  of  these  two  switching  times
which  means  that  we  in  general  want  to  design  the  circuit  to  have  equal  magnitude
charging and discharging currents, if possible. 
An  example  to  the  switching  transient  situation  in  the  MOSFET  inverter  with  a
resistive  pull-up  that  we  illustrated  earlier  is  shown  in  the  figures  below.  The  gate 
capacitance of the loading stage(s) has been modeled as a linear capacitor.  The charging
of  the  store  clearly  occurs  with  an  RC  time  constant  exponential;  the  discharging
transient is more complex (and typically is much the shorter of the two).

The power dissipation  consists of  two components.  One  is  the  static power;  the 
other  is  the  dynamic,  or  switching,  power.  Then  the  ouput  is  high,  the  static  power 
dissipated  is VDDIPU(output  high); when  the output  is  low,  the  static  power dissipated 
is VDDIPU(output low).  To get one number  to work with we commonly say an average
inverter  will  have  its  output  high  half  the  time,  on  average,  and  low  the  other  half. 
Thus  the  average  static  power  dissipation  is  (VDDIPU(output  high)  +  VDDIPU(output 
low))/2.

output  node  is  charged  to  roughly  VDD,  and  then  discharged  to  roughly  zero  volts.  If 
we  can  approximate  the  node  charge  store  with  a  linear  capacitor,  CL,  the  energy 
dissipated  in  charging  it  to VDD  is CLVDD2/2,  and  the  amount  of  energy  stored  on  the 
node  is  also  CLVDD2/2.  This  later  amount  of  energy  is  dissipated  when  the  node  is
discharged  so  in  one  cycle  the  total  energy  dissipated  is  CLVDD2. 
If  the  gate  is
operating  at a  frequency of  f,  the  average dynamic power dissipation is  f  times  this or  f
CLVDD2. 
You  can  refer  to  the  course  text  for discussions of noise margins,  fan  in  and  fan 
out, and manufacturability.
