In low-power applications an important metric the energy per operation, 
Epop.  There is an optimum supply voltage that minimizes Epop. 
 
Operating in strong inversion, Epop  = CLVDD 
 
2  , and reducing VDD  clearly 
 
reduces Epop.  As VDD  approaches VT, however, the contribution of sub-
 
threshold leakage becomes important, especially because the gate 
 
delay, τGD  (time per operation) increases as charging current decreases. 
In general: 

Only ID,sat  is different depending on the region of operation. 
 
In strong inversion:
 

Sub-threshold:

A is the average number of idle gates per active gate, and the leakage

Operation, cont. 
Reducing VDD  reduces the charging/discharging currents rapidly and 
 
 
increases the cycle time significantly, so Emin  operation is low speed.

Sub-threshold Circuit Design:  Linear circuits
 
 
  
 
Conventional stages and designs can be operated in sub-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
threshold, just as was done with CMOS gates.  They are 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
slow, but if power is a concern and high speed isn't (i.e, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
under 10 MHz is OK), they are worth considering. 

 
New types of MOS circuits are also 
 
 
 
 
 
possible:  Translinear circuits.* 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Consider first, for example, the 
sub-threshold current mirror on 
 
 
 
 
the right: 

 
Note the exp to ln and ln to exp 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conversions. 

 
*	  Translinear circuits were invented by Barrie Gilbert of Analog Devcies working with BJTs 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(IEEE JSSC, Vol SC-3, No. 4, Dec. 1968, pp. 353-373).
