Differential Amplifiers - common-mode input range 
   
 
 
 
(VC,min  ≤  vC  ≤ VC,max) 
            
   
 
 

We have said the output
 
changes very little for
 
common-mode inputs.
 
This is true as long as the
 
 
 
 
vC  doesn't push the
 
 
transistors out of
 
saturation. 
 
There are a minimum and 
 
maxiumum vC:
 
  
VC, max:  As vC  increases,
 
 
vDS8  and vDS9  decrease 
 
 
 
 
until Q8  and Q9  are no 
 
 
longer in saturation.
 
 

  
VC, min:  As vC  decreases,
 
 
 
vDS10  decreases until Q10
 
 
 
is no longer in saturation.
 

Clif Fonstad, 11/19/09 

The node between Q8/Q9  and Q10  moves up 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and down with vC.

[IDRSL]max, [ICRSL]max:
 
 - [IDRSL]max and [ICRSL]max  are 
 
 
determined by the desired 
voltage swing at the output 
and/or by the common-
mode input voltage range.
 - The ultimate limit is the 
 
power supply.
 

   
[VGS  - VT]min:
 - [VGS  - VT]min is set by how close 
 
to threshold the gate can safely 
be biased before the strong 
inversion, drift model fails.  We 
  
 
will say more about this shortly 
(Slide 23).
