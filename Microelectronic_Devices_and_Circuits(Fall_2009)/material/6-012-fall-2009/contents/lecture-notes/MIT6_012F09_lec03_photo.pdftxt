Comments on Photoconductive Detectors  - 9/17/09 Version 
Photoconductivity  was  first  reported  in  1873  by  W.  Smith  [J.  Soc. 
Telegraph  Eng.,  Vol.  2  (1873)  p.  31],  making  it  one  of  the  first  properties  of 
semiconductors  to  be  studied  and  exploited.  At  the  same  time,  some  of  the
newest,  fastest,  most  sophisticated,  and  most  complex  photodetectors  are  based
on  the  phenomenon  of  photoconductivity.  The  world’s  fasted  electrical  pulses 
are  made  using  photoconductive  switches  fabricated  in  gallium  arsenide  with  a 
very  short  minority  carrier  lifetime.  Many  night  vision  and  thermal  imaging 
systems  use  extrinsically-doped  silicon  photoconductor  arrays  to  take  infrared 
pictures,  and  still  others  use  quantum  well  infrared  photodetector  (QWIP) 
arrays. 
The  images  in  the  video  shown  in  lecture  were  made  with  a  camera  that
can  be  viewed  as  being  very  similar  functionally  to  the  silicon  vidicon  that  goes
into  a  home  video  camera,  the  difference  being  that  the  QWIP  “vidicons”  are 
sensitive  in  the  infrared  region  of  the  spectrum  rather  than  in  the  visible  region.
The  images  shown  in  the  video  were  made  using  a  camera  containing  a  256  by
256 pixel array of QWIP cells that were sensitive to “light” at 8 - 10 µm;  it had  to 
be  cooled  and was operated  at under  150 K (-123˚C).  Today's devices have pixel 
arrays as large as 1024 by 1024, or more. 
Other  infrared  detector  arrays  for  these  applications  can  be  made  from
silicon  doped  with  “deep”  donors  for  which  the  energy  required  to  ionize  the 
donor  corresponds  to  that  of  the  infrared  light  of  interest.  Unlike  the  column V 
donors  we  discussed  in  class,  these  donors  are  not  normally  ionized  at  room
temperature;  it  is  the  incident  light  that  ionizes  them,  leading  to  an  increased
conductivity,  i.e.,  photoconductivity.  These  detectors  are  called  extrinsically-
doped silicon photoconductors. 
is  how  one  can  make  a 
to  consider 
interesting  question 
An 
photoconductor detector which gives a  large signal,  and  yet  is linear, meaning  it
still operates under low level conditions.  Low  level injection means the optically
generated  carriers  are  far  less  numerous  than  the  majority  carriers,  so  it  seems
that  the  change  in  conductivity  can  never  be  a  very  big  fraction  of  the  total
conductivity.  The way  engineers have gotten around  this problem  is by  looking
for  materials  in  which  the  majority  carrier  mobility  is much,  much  smaller  than
the  minority  carrier  mobility.  Usually  the  two  mobilities  are  comparable,  so
finding such a material  is not easy, unless one uses a  trick.  The trick  is to photo-
excite  the  carriers  not  from  lattice  bonds,  but  instead  from  deep  donors,  as  is
done  in  the  extrinsic  silicon  photoconductors  mentioned  above.  The  ionized 
donors  correspond  mathematically  to  the  majority  carriers,  but  they  can  not 
move and thus have effectively zero mobility.

Returning  to  the  QWIP  devices,  they  are  made  using  layers  of  different
semiconductors  whose  thicknesses  and  compositions  are  chosen  to  create 
electrons localized in space much like those associated with a deep donor ion
(except  that  they  are  localized  in  planes,  not  about  points  in  space  like  donor
ions). 
They  are  structurally  much  more  complex 
than  a 
traditional 
photoconductor,  but  in  exchange  for  the  increased  complexity  one  gains  much 
more 
flexibility 
in  designing 
the  performance  and  spectral  response 
characteristics of the devices.
