MOSFET Drain Current Modeling 
In  the  Gradual  Channel  Model  for  the  MOSFET  we  write  the  drain 
current,  iD,  as  the  product  of  qN* (y)  ,  the  inversion  layer  sheet  charge  density  at 
position  y  along  the  channel;  sy(y),  the  net  drift  velocity  of  the  inversion  layer
carriers  there  (electrons  in  the  n-channel  device  we  are  modeling),  and  W,  the 
channel width: 
iD  =  - qN* (y)  sy(y) W 

with 

εox 
qN* (y)  =  -
tox 
Substituting these expressions yields: 

[vGB  - VT(y)] 

and 

dvCS(y)
sy(y)  =  - µe Ey  =  µe  dy 

, as  εox/tox and 

[vGB  - VT(y)] 

dvCS(y)
iD  =  W µ  Cox * 
dy 
where we have identified the gate capacitance per unit area, Cox * 
where the threshold voltage is given by 
VT(y)  =  VFB + |2φp| +vCB(y) +  1 
Cox * 
Defining  the  body  factor,  γ,  as  2εSi  qNA  /Cox * 
vBS, we can rewrite this as 
VT(y)  =  VFB + |2φp| +vCS(y) - vBS  + γ  |2φp| + vCS(y) - vBS 
and thus we can write iD as 

2εSi  qNA  [|2φp| + vCB(y)

,  and  writing  vCB(y)  as  vCS(y)  -

dvCS(y)
iD = W µe C * 
[vGS  -VFB  - |2φp|- vCS(y)  - γ  |2φp| + vCS(y) - vBS  ]  dy 
ox 
To proceed we  integrate both  sides for y = 0 to y = L,  recognizing  that the 
right-hand  integral  is  equivalent  to  integrating  with  respect  to  vCS(y)  from  0  to 
vDS:

The left-hand integral is iDL, so we can write iD  as 
vDS 
iD  = K ⌡⌠ [vGS  -VFB  - |2φp|- vCS  - γ  |2φp| + vCS  - vBS  ]  dvCS 
0 
where K is defined as (W/L) µe Cox * 
. 
It is not hard to do the integral on the right-hand side of this equation, and
you may want to do it as an exercise (it is done  in the text and  the result is given
in  Equation  10.9).  The  resulting  expression  is  awkward  and,  most  importantly,
the  threshold  voltage,  VT,  is  hard  to  identify  in  the  expression  and  the  role  it 
plays  in  the  current-voltage  relationship  is  hard  to  understand;  the  result  is  not 
very  intuitive.  It will not be obvious  to you until you get much more experience
with  MOSFETs,  but  it  is  very  desirable  from  a  modeling  standpoint  to  do
something  to  simplify  the  result  and  to  get  an  expression  that  gives  us  more 
useful insight. 
Many texts simply ignore the vCS  factor under the radical and write 
vDS 
iD  ≈  K ⌡⌠ [vGS  -VFB  - |2φp|- vCS  - γ  |2φp|- vBS  ]  dvCS 
0 
which we can simplify as 
vDS 
iD  = K ⌠⌡ [vGS  - VT' - vCS  ]  dvCS 
0 
with  VT'  defined  to  be  VFB  +  |2φp|  +  γ  |2φp| - vBS 
get 

.  Doing  the  integral  we 

iD  =  K [(vGS  - VT')vDS  -

vDS2 
2 
A more satisfying approach is to not ignor  the vCS  factor, but rather  to  try 
to linearize the dependance on it.  The troublesome term is 
|2φp| + vCS(y) - vBS 

] 

which can be written as

≈ 

|2φp| - vBS 

|2φp| + vCS  - vBS  = 

vCS 
1 + |2φp| - vBS 
vCS 
2(|2φp| - vBS)  ] 
≈  |2φp| - vBS  [1 + 
vCS 
|2φp| - vBS  +  2  |2φp| - vBS 
With this approximation, we next define 1/2  |2φp| - vBS 
to be δ and (1 + γδ) to 
be α, and write iD  as 
vDS 
iD  ≈  K ⌠⌡ [vGS  -VFB  - |2φp|- α vCS  - γ  |2φp|- vBS  ]  dvCS 
0 
Using our earlier definition for VT', this becomes 
vDS 
iD  ≈  K ⌠⌡ [vGS  - VT' - α vCS  ]  dvCS 
0 

and doing the integral yields 

] 

vDS2 
iD  =  K [(vGS  - VT')vDS  - α  2
In saturation, which now occurs for vDS  > (vGS  - VT')/α, we have 
K 
α (vGS  - VT')  2 
iD  = 2
These  results  are  the  same  as  those we  obtained  after  ignoring  vCS  under 
the radical, except that we now have a factor of α appearing.  To the extent that α 
is  very  near  one,  our  earlier  approximation  is  correct,  inspite  of  it  being  rather 
adhoc.  Collecting all the factors in α, we find it is 
2εSi  qNA 
|2φp| - vBS 

α  =  1 +  2 Cox *

Typically  this  is near  1,  and  it can be  approximated  as  such.  On  the other hand, 
it is easy to leave α in the expression for iD  since is such a minor complication. 
To summarize, our expressions for the drain current, when we retain α are 
iD  =  0 
for (vGS  - VT')/α < 0 < vDS 
(Cutoff) 
K 
α (vGS  - VT')  2 
iD  = 2

for 0 < (vGS  - VT')/α  < vDS 

(Saturation) 

]  for 0 < vDS  < (vGS  - VT')/α 

(Linear region) 

vDS2 
iD  =  K [(vGS  - VT')vDS  - α  2 
with K, VT’, γ, and α defined as 
K  ≡  (W/L) µe Cox * 
VT'  ≡  VFB + |2φp| + γ  |2φp| - vBS 
2εSi  qNA

2εSi  qNA
