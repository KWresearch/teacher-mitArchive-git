The impact of Q13' and Q13 on the voltage gains
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

We added transistor Q13 
to the left side of the DP 
second gain stage (the 
Current Mirror), and said 
it has no effect on the Avd 
or Avc  of this stage.  In 
 
 
fact it does have some 
impact on the common-
mode voltage gain.  The 
  
 
following few sides look 
at this impact. 
 
We find that now: 

 
Remember that it is possible to make the bias currents in the two legs of the mirror (Q11/Q14  and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q12/Q15) different by making the transistors widths different.

In the design problem we 
have a current mirror stage 
with a level shift diode in 
each leg.  The bias currents 
of the two legs can also be 
different. 

We can do an 
LEC analysis of 
 
this circuit in the 
same way we did 
without the two 
diodes.  We start 
with the LEC for 
the left side and 
find vinner:

Mid-band, cont:  The mid-band range of frequencies
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this range of frequencies the gain is a constant, and the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phase shift between the input and output is also constant
 
(either 0˚ or 180˚). 
 
 
 

 
 
All of the parasitic and intrinsic device capacitances
 
 
 
 
 
are effectively open circuits 
 
 
 
 
 
All of the biasing and coupling capacitors are 
 
 
 
 
 
effectively short circuits

Open circuit time constants (OCTC) recipe: 
1.	  Pick one Cgd, Cgs, Cµ, Cπ, etc. (call it C1) and assume all 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
others are open circuits. 
2.	  Find the resistance in parallel with C1  and call it R1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.	  Calculate 1/R1C1  and call it ω1. 
 
 
 
 
4.	  Repeat this for each of the N different Cgd's, Cgs's, Cµ's, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cπ's, etc., in the circuit finding ω1, ω2, ω3, …, ωN. 
5.	  Define ωHI* as the inverse of the sum of the inverses of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the N ωi's:
 
 
ωHI* = [Σ(ωi)-1]-1  = [ΣRiCi]-1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6.	  The true ωHI  is similar to, but greater than, ωHI*. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Observations: 
The OCTC method gives a conservative, low estimate for ωHI. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The sum of inverses favors the smallest ωi, and thus the 
capacitor with the largest RC product dominates ωHI*. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Clif Fonstad, 12/3/09	 

Lecture 23  - Slide 8 

Estimating ωLO  - Short Circuit Time Constants Method 
   
 
 
 
 
Short circuit time constants (SCTC) recipe: 
1.	  Pick one CO, CI, CE, etc. (call it C1) and assume all others 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are short circuits. 
2.	  Find the resistance in parallel with C1  and call it R1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.	  Calculate 1/R1C1  and call it ω1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.	  Repeat this for each of the M different CI's, CO's, CE's, CS's, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
etc., in the circuit finding ω1, ω2, ω3, …, ωM. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.	  Define ωLO* as the sum of the M ωj's:
 
 
ωLO* = [Σ(ωj)] = [Σ(RjCj)-1]
 
 
 
 
 
6.	  The true ωLO  is similar to, but less than, ωLO*. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Observations: 
The SCTC method gives a conservative, high estimate for ωLO. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The sum of inverses favors the largest ωj, and thus the 
capacitor with the smallest RC product dominates ωLO*.

Summary of OCTC and SCTC results 
 

•  OCTC:  an estimate for ωHI

ωHI  for the Common Source - the full treatment
 
 
 

The full gain expression is: 
 
 
 
 

There are two poles (call them ω1  and ω2), and one zero (call it ω3):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Upon examination of these three expressions we find that  ω1  << ω2, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
ω3, so ω1  is clearly the dominant pole, and ωHI  is effectively ω1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Note:  Cdb  has been neglected to keep
 
 
 
 
 
 
things simpler; it is very small.

ωHI  for the Common Source:  the Miller effect 
  
 
 
In both of our analyses we note that in the dominant term Cgd  is 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
multiplied by the factor (gl'+gt+gm)rl'.  Noting (1) that typically it 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is true that gm  >> gt, and (2) that -gmrl' is the mid-band voltage 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gain, Av, of the amplifier, we see that this factor can be approx-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
imated as one minus the voltage gain of the stage, i.e.: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
If the voltage gain is large, then in effect Cgd  looks bigger from
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
the input side of the circuit than it really is, i.e. (1 - Av)Cgd:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

This "magnification" of a capacitor bridging the input and the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
output of a voltage amplifier, as Cgd  does here, by |Av| is called 
 
 
 
 
the Miller effect.

Multi-stage amplifier analysis and design:  The µA741
 
 
 
 
  
Why is there a capacitor in the circuit?:  the added capacitor
introduces a low
 frequency pole. 
 

 
 

Without it the gain 
is still greater than 1 
when the phase shift 
exceeds 180˚ (dashed 
curve).  This can result 
in positive feedback 
and instability. 

Low

With it the gain 
is less than 1 by

Lecture 23 - Circuits at High Frequencies - Summary
 
Bounding mid-band - finding ωHI, ωLO 
 
 
  
ωHI:  Find the resistance in parallel with each device capacitor assuming the
such device capacitors are open circuits, calculate all the RC time
 
constants, and add them.  The inverse is a lower bound on ωHI. 
  
ωLO:  Find the resistance in parallel with each bias capacitor assuming the
other such capacitors are short circuits, calculate all the 1/RC frequencies,
and add them.  This sum is an upper bound on ωLO. 
 
The Miller effect: why Cgd  is so important 
 
 
 
 
The concept: a capacitor shunting a gain stage looks larger by (1 - A )v
 
 
  
Examples:  (1)  The Miller effect magnifies Cgd  in common-source stages;
 
 
  
(2) There is no significant Miller effect impact on common-gate stages or
on source-followers; (3)  The Miller effect is used in the µA741 to get the
relatively large capacitor needed to stabilize it. 
The Marvelous cascode 
 
  
 
 
Concept and ωHI:  Current gain from a CS stage and voltage gain from 
    
a CG to circumvent the Miller effect. 
Output resistance:  significantly larger than CS alone. 
 
  
 
  
The costs:  The added device increases the voltage distance away from 
the rails and limits voltage swings
