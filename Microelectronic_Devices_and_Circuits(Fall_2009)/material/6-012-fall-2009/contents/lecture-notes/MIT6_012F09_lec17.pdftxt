GSDqDBiDBqSBqGqBCBECiB’IBS!FiB’qBEBAIBSqABReviewing our LECs:  Important points made in Lec. 13
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
We found LECs for BJTs and MOSFETs in both strong inversion 
 
and sub-threshold.  When vbs  = 0, they all look very similar: 

Most linear circuits are designed to operate at frequencies where
the capacitors look like open circuits.  We can thus do our 
designs neglecting them.* 
Bias dependences: 

The LEC elements all depend on the bias levels.  Establishing a

 
known, stable bias point is a key part of linear circuit design.

We use our large signal models in this design and analysis.
 

Clif Fonstad, 11/10/09 

* Only when we want to determine the maximum frequency to which 
  
our designs can usefully operate must we include the capacitors.

linear amplifiers 
There are 12 choices: three 
 
possible nodes to connect to 
the input, and for each one, 
two nodes from which to take 
an output, and two choices of 
what to do with the remaining 
node (ground it or connect it 
to something). 
Not all these choices work 
well, however.  In fact only 
three do:

Common emitter example: 
 
 
The linear equivalent circuit for the common 
emitter amplifier stage on the left is drawn 
below with all of the elements included: 

 
 
The capacitors are of two types: 
 
 
 
Biasing capacitors:  they are typically very large (in µF range)
 
they will be effective shorts above some ωLO
 
(CO, CE, etc.) 
Device capacitors:  they are typically very small (in pF range) 
they will be effective open circuits below some ωHI 
(Cπ, Cµ, etc.)

block stages, often such as the single transistor stages we

Note:  More advanced multi-stage amplifiers might include
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
feedback, the coupling of the outputs of some stages to the
 
 
 
inputs of preceding stages.  This is not shown in this figure.
