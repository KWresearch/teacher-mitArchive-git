Summary of OCTC and SCTC results 
 

•  OCTC:  an estimate for ωHI 
  
1.	  ωHI*  is a weighted sum of ω's associated with device capacitances: 
 
(add RC's and invert) 
 
2.  Smallest ω  (largest RC) dominates ωHI * 
3.  Provides a lower bound on ωHI 
  
•  SCTC:  an estimate for ωLO 
 
 
 
1.	  ωLO *  is a weighted sum of w's associated with bias capacitors: 
(add ω's directly) 
2.  Largest ω  (smallest RC) dominates ωLO * 
 
3.  Provides a upper bound on ωLO

The monolithic capacitor made the µA741
"complete" and a big success.  Why is it
needed?  What does it do?

Why is there a capacitor in the circuit?:  the added capacitor
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
introduces a low 
frequency pole
   
that stabilizes 
     
the circuit. 

 
 

Without it the gain 
is still greater than 1 
when the phase shift 
exceeds 180˚ (dashed 
curve).  This can result 
in positive feedback 
and instability.

With it the gain 
is less than 1 by

shift exceeds 180˚ 
(solid curve).

Intrinsic performance - the best we can do 
 
 
 
 
 
We've focused on ωHI, the upper limit of mid-band, but even when ω > ωHI 
the |Av| > 1, and the circuit is useful.  For example, for the common 
source stage we had 

 
A Bode plot of 
 
 
 
 
Av  is shown 
 
 
to the right: 

When we look for a metric to compare the ultimate 
performance limits of transistors, we make note of 
this and ask how high can a device in isolation have 
 
provide voltage or current gain?

Consider the two possibilities shown below, one for a voltage input and 
output where the metric would be the open circuit voltage gain, Av,oc, 
and the other for a current input and output with the metric being the 
short circuit current gain, Ai,sc  (commonly written βsc): 
 

Of these two alternatives, β is the more useful.  A
 
 
 
is derived with a 
v,oc 
sc 
voltage source driving a capacitor, something that doesn't give a mean-
 
ingful result and leads to ever increasing input power.  It also does not 
involve gm  and Cgs.  Consequently, short circuit current gain is used as 
 
the intrinsic high frequency performance metric for transistors.

The common-source short-circuit current gain is:
 
 
 
 
 
 

there is one pole at ω = 0, and one zero, ωz: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
The short circuit current gain, βsc, is infinite at DC (ω = 0) , and 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
its magnitude decreases linearly with increasing frequency.

Gate delay/minimum cycle time: 
 
For MOSFETs operating in strong inversion, no velocity saturation: 

Comparing this to the channel transit time:
 

We see that the cycle time is a multiple of the transit time:

What about the intrinsic ωHI  of a MOSFET operating with full

The basic result is unchanged; we still have: 

However, now gm  is different: 
 

With this we have: 

 
In the case where velocity saturation dominates, we once again find 
 
that it is the channel transit time that is the ultimate limit.
