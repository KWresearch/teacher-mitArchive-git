General approach: 
   
 
The load, CL, is a non-
   
 
 
 
 
 
linear charge store, but
 
for MOSFETs it is fairly
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
linear and it is useful to
 
 
think linear:
 
dvout/dt ≈  iCL/CL

 Our calculation says that the 
transfer characteristic is 
vertical in Region III. 
We know it must have some 
slope, but what is it? 
To see, calculate the small 
signal gain about the bias 
 
 
point:  VIN  = VOUT  = VDD/2 
 
 
 
 
Begin with the small signal model:

Returning to the transfer characteristic, 
we see that the slope in Region III is 
not infinite, but is instead: 

 
Final comment:  A quick and 
easy way to approximate the 
transfer characteristic of a 
CMOS gate is to simply draw 
the three straight line portions 
in Regions I, III, and V:

Sanity check 
 
   
CMOS gate lengths are now under 0.1 µm (100 nm).  The electric field 
in the channel can be very high:  Ey  ≥ 104  V/cm when vDS  ≥ 0.1 V. 
 
 
 
   

   

Clearly the velocity of the electrons and holes in the channel will 
 
be saturated at even low values of vDS! 
What does this mean for the device and inverter characteristics?

Drain current:  iD(vGS,vDS,vBS)
 With Model A*, the low field iD  model, s = µE, holds for increasing vDS 
 
 
until the velocity of the electrons at some point in the channel 
reaches ssat  (this will happen at the drain end).  When this happens 
 
the current saturates, and does not increase further for larger vDS.

If the channel length, L, is sufficiently small we can simplify the 
model even further because the carrier velocity will saturate at 
such a small vDS  that for vDS  ≥ EcritL the inversion layer will be 
   
 
 
uniform and all the carriers will be drifting at their saturation 
velocity.  In this situation (the saturation region) we will have: 

For smaller vDS, prior to the onset of velocity saturation, the linear 
region model we had earlier will hold.  The entire characteristic, 
 
neglecting the vDS/2 factor in the linear region expression, is 

    

 
Note that the current in saturation increases linearly with (vGS  - VT), 
rather than as its square like it did then the gate was longer.
