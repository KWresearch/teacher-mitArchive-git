Two Active Loads for Differential Amplifiers:  The Lee Load and the Current Mirror Load

Two Active Loads for Differential Amplifiers:
1.  Current mirror load 
2.  Lee load 
1.  The current mirror load: 
The  current mirror  load provides double-ended  to  single-ended  conversion without 
suffering the loss of a factor of  two in differential-mode gain (the common-mode gain is 
twice  as  large  also, but  still  very small)  .  It comes  in a variety of versions  (pnp, npn,  n-
MOS, p-MOS);  the examples below use p-channel MOSFETs in the mirror loading an n-
channel common-source differential gain stage. 
We  can  begin  to  understand  how  the  current  mirror  load  functions  by  referring  to
the  two  figures  below.  The  active  nature  of  the  load  doubles  the  current  delivered  to 
the  load  with  differential-mode  inputs,  and while  not  sending  any  current  to  the  load 
with common-mode  inputs.  The results of a more detailed analysis are  listed below  the 
figures. 
Difference-mode inputs: 

Common-mode inputs: 

A  full  analysis  shows  that with differential  inputs,  ±  vid/2,  as  on  the  left  above,  the 
output, vout, is given as: 

vout  ≈  [2gm3/(go2 + go4  + GL)] vid/2 
and with common-mode inputs, vic, as on the right above, the output, vout, is given by: 
vout  ≈  [gob/2(gm2  + go4  + GL)] vic  ≈  [gob/2 gm2] vic 
The total single-ended output for a pair of inputs to the stage is: 
vout  ≈  [2gm3/(go2 + go4  + GL)] (vi1  – vi2)/2 + [gob/2 gm2] (vi1  + vi2)/2

2.  The Lee load 
The  Lee  active  load  provides  a  typically  high  differential-mode  gain  and  an 
unusually  small  common-mode  gain.  The  conventional  differential  amplifier  with  a 
current-source  load  will  have  a  common-mode  gain  of  order  unity,  whereas  the  Lee 
Load  yields a  common-mode gain one  to  two  orders of magnitude  smaller  [as much as
something on the order of (VGS  - VT)min/VA  times smaller]. 
The Lee Load as normally drawn is shown below, but it is somewhat easier to 

understand  if  it  is  redrawn as  shown below.  In  this presentation  it  is easier  to  see how
the  two outputs  are  fed  back  to  the  inputs  of  the  active  loads  so as  to  cancel  each other
out in difference-mode, and to re-enforce each other in common-mode.

To  analyze  quantitatively  the  Lee  Load  performance,  we  can  do  small  signal 
analyses  using  half-circuit  techniques  and  difference-mode  and  common-mode  inputs. 
We first consider difference-mode inputs, and then common-mode: 
Difference-mode analysis: 
The circuit drawn with difference-mode inputs is shown below: 

The  linear  equivalent  half-circuit of  this  amplifier with  difference-mode  inputs  is  as 
illustrated  below.  Note  that  the  gmvgs  generators  for  the  p-channel  MOSFETs  are  in 
parallel with vod/2,  and  vgs  is + or  - vod/2,  so  the generators  look  like  conductances of 
value + or - gm, respectively. 

Referring to the linear equivalent half-circuit, we see that 
vod/2 = [gm5/(go5  + go1  + go3  + gm1  - gm3  + GL)] vid/2  =  [gm5/(go5  + 2 go1  + GL)] vid/2 
Thus the difference-mode voltage gain, Avd  is 
Avd = gm5/(go5  + 2 go1  + GL) 
We see that the gm  factors in the denominator, which are the biggest factors there, are of
equal magnitude,  but  of  opposite  sign,  and  thus  cancel,  resulting  in  a  large  difference-
mode gain.

Common-mode analysis: 
The circuit drawn with common-mode inputs is shown below: 

The  linear  equivalent  half-circuit  of  this  amplifier  with  common-mode  inputs  is  as 
illustrated below: 

Referring to the linear equivalent half-circuit, we see that 
voc  ≈  [gob/2(go1  + go3  + gm1  + gm3  + GL)] vic 
It  is  clear  that  this  time  the  gm  terms  are  not  going  to  cancel.  Continuing we  find  that 
they in fact dominate the denominator: 
voc  ≈  [gob/2(2go1  + 2 gm1  + GL)] vic ≈  [gob/4 gm1] vic 
Thus the common-mode voltage gain, Avc  is approximately 
Avc ≈ gob/4gm1 
Avc  is typically quite small because gob will be very small, and gm1 will be much larger.
