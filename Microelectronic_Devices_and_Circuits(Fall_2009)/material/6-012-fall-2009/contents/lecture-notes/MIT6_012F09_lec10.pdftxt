p-Sin+BSGSiO2+–vGS(= vGB)BG+–p-SiSiO2x-tox0vGBMOS Capacitors:  Where do the electrons in the inversion 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
layer come from? 
 
 

 
Diffusion from the p-type substrate? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If we relied on diffusion of minority carrier electrons from 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the p-type substrate it would take a long time to build up 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the inversion layer charge.  The current density of elec-
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
trons flowing to the interface is just the current across a 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reverse biased junction (the p-substrate to the inversion 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
layer in this case): 

 
The time, τ, it takes this flux to build up an inversion charge
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is the the increase in the charge, Δqn, divided by Je: 

so τ  is

and Δ(vGB-VT) = 0.5 V in the preceding expression for τ we 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
find τ ≈ 50 hr! 
Flow from the adjacent n+-region? 
 
 
 
 
 
As the surface potential is increased, the potential energy 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
barrier between the adjacent n+ region and the region 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
under the gate is reduced for electrons and they readily 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
flow (diffuse in weak inversion, and drift and diffuse in 
strong inversion) into the channel; that's why the n+ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
region is put there: 

 
There are many electrons 
 
 
here and they don't have 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
far to go once the barrier 
 
is lowered.

state so the carrier populations are in equilibrium with 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the potential barriers, φ(x), as they are in thermal 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
equilibrium, and we have: 

Once again this means we can find φ(x), and then n(x) and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
p(x), by solving Poisson's equation: 
 
 
 
 

This version is only valid, however, when |φ(x)| ≤  -φp. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When |φ(x)| > -φp  we have accumulation and inversion layers, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and we assume them to be infinitely thin sheets of charge, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
i.e. we model them as delta functions.

MOS Capacitors:	  Sub-threshold charge
  
 
Assessing how much we are neglecting 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sheet density of electrons below threshold in weak inversion: 
 
 
 
 
 
In the depletion approximation for the MOS we say that the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
charge due to the electrons is negligible before we reach 
threshold and the strong inversion layer builds up: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
But how good an approximation is this?  To see, we calculate
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
the electron charge below threshold (weak inversion): 
 
 
 
 
 
 

This integral is difficult to do because φ(x) is non-linear
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

but if we use a linear approximation for φ(x) near x = 0, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
where the term in the integral is largest, we can get a very 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
good approximate analytical expression for the integral.

We begin by saying

With this linear approximation to φ(x) we can do the integral

To proceed it is easiest to evaluate this expression for various 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
values of φ(0) below threshold (when its value is |φp|), and to 
also find the corresponding value of vGB, from

MOS Capacitors:	  A few more questions you might have

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
about our model
 
 
 
 
 
Why does the depletion stop growing above threshold? 
 
 
 
 
A positive voltage on the gate must be terminated on negative
charge in the semiconductor.  Initially the only negative charges
 
are the ionized acceptors, but above threshold the electrons in the 
strong inversion layer are numerous enough to terminate all the
gate voltage in excess of VT.  The electrostatic potential at 0+ does
not increase further and the depletion region stops expanding. 
How wide are the accumulation and strong inversion layers? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A parameter that puts a rough upper bound on this is the extrinsic 
 
Debye length 

When N is 1019  cm-3, LeD  is 1.25 nm.  The figure on Foil 11 seems to 
 
 
 
 
 
say this is ~ 5x too large and that the number is nearer 0.3 nm.* 
 
 
Is n, p = nie±qV/kT  valid in those layers? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It holds in Si until |φ| ≈ 0.54 V, but when |φ| is larger than this Si 
 
   
 
becomes "degenerate" and the carrier concentration is so large
that the simple models we use are no longer sufficient and the
dependence on φ  is more complex.  Thinking of degenerate Si as 
 
a metal is far easier, and works extremely well for our purposes.

We restrict voltages to the following ranges: 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
This means that the source-substrate and drain-substrate 
 
 
 
 
 
junctions are always reverse biased and thus that: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
The gate oxide is insulating so we also have: 
 
 
 
 
 
 

With the back current, iB, zero, and the gate current, iG, zero, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the only current that is not trivial to model is iD.

considering the in-plane problem, we find: 

This expression can be integrated with respect to dy for 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
y = 0 to y = L.  On the left-hand the integral with respect 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to y can be converted to one with respect to vCS, which 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ranges from 0 at y = 0, to vDS  at y = L: 

Doing the definite integrals on each side we obtain a 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
relatively simple expression for iD:

that it traces inverted parabolas as shown below.

easily found.  Taking the derivative and setting it equal to

• Quantitative modeling (Apply depl. approx. to MOS cap., vBC  = 0) 
 
Definitions:  VFB ≡ vGB  such that φ(0) = φp-Si 
 
 
 
Cox * ≡ εox/tox 
 
 
 
 
VT ≡ vGB  such that φ(0) = – φp-Si 
 
Results and expressions 
 
 
 
(For n-MOS example) 
 
 
1. Flat-band voltage, VFB  = φp-Si  – φm 
 
 
 
2. Accumulation layer sheet charge density, qA* = – Cox *(vGB  – VFB) 
 
 
 
 
 
3. Maximum depletion region width,  XDT  = [2εSi|2φp-Si|/qNA]1/2 
 
4. Threshold voltage, VT  = VFB  – 2φp-Si + 
 
 
[2εSi qNA|2φp-Si|]1/2/Cox * 
  
5. Inversion layer sheet charge density, qN* = – Cox *(vGB  – VT) 
 
 
 
 
 
• Subthreshold charge 
Negligible?:  Yes in general, but (1) useful in some cases, and (2) an
  
issue for modern ULSI logic and memory circuits 
• MOS with bias applied to the adjacent n+-region 
 
Maximum depletion region width:  XDT  = [2εSi(|2φp-Si| – vBC)/qNA]1/2
 
 
 
  
 
 
Threshold voltage:  VT  = VFB  – 2φp-Si  + [2εSi qNA(|2φp-Si| – vBC)]1/2/Cox *
