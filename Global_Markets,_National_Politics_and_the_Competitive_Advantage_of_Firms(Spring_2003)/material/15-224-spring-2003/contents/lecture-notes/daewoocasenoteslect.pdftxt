Strengths / weaknesses 


Korea 

- Government role is impressive. State led developmental model. Similar to 
other Asian countries and also France. 
- After Korean war GDP was below Brazil, Mexico, India. Incredibly fast 
growth after that targeting certain successful industries. 
- Good social welfare and educational system. 

How did Korea do this? Is this model sustainable? 

Government role 

1-  Plans: 
a.  	 1960’s: infrastructure and simple industries: plywood and cotton 
spinning (light industries). Later on garments and shoes. 
b.  1970’s: promotion of heavy industry (steel, chemicals, autos) 
c.  1980’s: High Tech (ships, electronics) 
d.  1990’s: continue in high tech. 

- Discipline: Government played an important role in discipline of the 
workforce (organized labor) and firms (performance based credit 
assignment, mainly on exports) 
- Subsidized credit: borrowed from abroad and used control of financial 
system to promote its plans. 
- Wrong Prices: 

•  Protectionism for its market (i.e. steel) 
•  Subsidies 
Import restrictions: not ISI, but as a way to develop 
• 
local industries. 
- Technology: used market access to extract licenses from multinationals.

- Education: huge investment in primary / secondary schools. 95% 
enrollment (1994). 20% higher education. Vocational training promoted. 
1980’s huge investment in engineering and science. People sent abroad 
and bring back knowledge to Korea. 

Other actors / factors 

- Chaebols: conglomerates of firms, similar to Japanese model. 
Government played role in forming this groups. Strategy: form powerful 
groups to be able to compete. 
- Cold war: US played some role in helping this development. 

Given that this model appeared to work, what happened after July 1997? Was 
there a collapse? If yes, why did the system collapse? Is it sustainable? 

- Reform pushed by IMF / Government. 
- Bankruptcies in different sectors. 
Job guarantee no longer exists. 
-

Daewoo Case – What happened to this Chaebol? 

- Highly leveraged. D/E of four. 
- Growing and grabbing cheap deals in order to increase size and power. 
Incentive of system is for market share. 
- Decision to go into auto industry may have been a problem. 

Industry 

- New entrants: difficult due to size of conglomerates. 
- Buyers: recession, devaluation so it is hard to sell. Principal markets are 
other developing countries also in trouble 
- Substitutes: not a problem 
- Suppliers: captive 

Porter’s Diamond 

Industry problems exacerbated by national system and set incentives. 

- Demand: suppressed at country level. High overcapacity 
- Factors: skewed cost of capital in the system. Government intervention. 
- Related industries: no power vs. the Chaebols 
- Structure: Chaebol is key to understanding the complicated system. Big 
players lock up new markets.

Issue: bankruptcy or nationalization? 
Interest: government, suppliers, financial communities. Which do we take 
into consideration? 
Institutions: not only the firm, but relationship with other players and 
actors. 
Inform: what information do we want? Going forward, how does it use the 
information to show it was a good gamble?
