Note on Analyzing Business Environments  

Global Markets 

Spring 2003 


This note seeks to provide a framework for students in Global Markets (15.224) as 

they analyze different business environments around the world. It is divided into 

two parts. First, it will review two common models used to assess/analyze different 

national economies. Then, it will lay out the more pragmatic, focused approach 

employed in our class. 


I. 

Two Common Approaches 

There are two basic approaches to understanding business environments. One 
focuses on Macroeconomic indicators and National-level Institutions of the political 
economy being analyzed. The second is based on Michael Porter’s Competitive 
Diamond. 

1.  Macroeconomics/National Institutions 

The first approach, the one that focuses on macroeconomic indicators and national-
level institutional arrangements basically treats a national economy as if it were a 
unitary and homogenous actor. In other words, this approach holds that in order to 
understand differences in economic behavior across countries, we should first 
examine a set of macroeconomic indicators like growth rates, trade balance, 
inflation rates, government spending patterns, etc. in order to assess the 
macroeconomic “health” of any particular country. The idea behind this is that in 
order for a national economy to be vibrant, competitive, and strong…in order for it 
to serve as a hospitable environment for investment or even start-up activity, it 
should have its macroeconomic house in order. Using these macroeconomic 
indicators, we can compare across countries and assess their relative strengths and 
weaknesses. This is the approach that you learned in your macro-international 
economics course. 

In addition to these macroeconomic variables, this first approach also examines a 
set of national institutions . Institutions frequently examined include: 
•	 Government Structures and Policies (i.e., Is the government stable or weak, is it 
a unitary/centralized structure or a more decentralized/federalist one, where are 
key decisions made?, etc.) 
•	 Financial Institutions (Capital-markets or Credit-based system, How develped 
are the capital markets?, How developed/available is VC) 
•	 Legal Regimes (How well-protected are property rights (including intellectual 
property)? What protections do minority shareholders enjoy?) 
•  Education and Training System 
•  Labor Relations System

The reasons for layering an analysis of these institutions on top of the 
macroeconomic indicators is to see if a particular business environment has the 
“right” kinds of institutions to guarantee a healthy macro-economy and an 
attractive business environment. 

2.  Porter’s Diamond 

The second common approach focuses less on macroeconomic indicators or 
national-level institutional arrangements and much more on the micro-level factors 
that shape the competitiveness of particular industry clusters. 

Attached is a figure that outlines Porter’s model.  The basic idea behind this model 
is that for us to understand the competitiveness of a particular industry cluster , we 
need to focus on how the Demand Factors, Supply Conditions, Structure, Strategy, 
and Rivalry of Firms, and the Existence of Related and Supporting Industries of a 
particular national economy create a hospitable environment for certain industries. 

Government policies, macroeconomic variables ,national institutional arrangements 
play a much less decisive role on this model. 

There exist benefits and deficits to both models. The first is too top-down, not 
sufficiently attentive to the internal heterogeneity of different national economies or 
even the different needs of different kinds of industries. The second is more careful 
about the micro-level factors shaping business activity but not sufficiently 
appreciative of the way national policies and institutions influence micro-level 
factors and conditions. 

II. 

The Need for a Synthesis 

In this class, we try to synthesize the best elements of the two above models but 
focus our attention particularly on those elements that are important for 
entrepreneurial activity. 

Thus, we begin with Porter’s Diamond but focus it on the particular business or 
sector we are interested in analyzing. How the Diamond in a particular country or 
region operates for say a biotech start-up may be very different than say for a 
software company. We need to be focused on the particular business/industry at 
hand. We also need to look for those factors listed in our earlier checklist. 

Beginning from there, we look at how the various macro-level factors (economic and 
non-economic alike) may influence the key points of the diamond in either positive 
or negative ways. This allows us to bring in relevant information about the macro-
economic or legal-political situation of a particular country so that it is actually 
useful to our analysis.

To help focus our analysis, we employ Baron’s 4 I heuristic: 

1.  Issue 
2.  Interests 
3.  Institutions 
4.  Information 

Together, these different approaches should enable us to focus on the kinds of data 
we need to collect to better understand different business environments.
