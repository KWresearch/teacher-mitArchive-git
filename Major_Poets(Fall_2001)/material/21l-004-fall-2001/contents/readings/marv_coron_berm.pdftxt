THE CORONET 
 
WHEN for the thorns with which I long, too long, 
With many a piercing wound, 
My Saviour’s head have crowned, 
I seek with garlands to redress that wrong,— 
Through every garden, every mead, 
I gather flowers (my fruits are only flowers), 
Dismantling all the fragrant towers 
That once adorned my shepherdess’s head : 
And now, when I have summed up all my store, 
Thinking (so I my self deceive) 
So rich a chaplet thence to weave 
As never yet the King of Glory wore, 
Alas ! I find the Serpent old, 
That, twining in his speckled breast, 
About the flowers disguised, does fold 
With wreaths of fame and interest. 
Ah, foolish man, that wouldst debase with them, 
And mortal glory, Heaven’s diadem ! 
But thou who only couldst the Serpent tame, 
Either his slippery knots at once untie, 
And disentangle all his winding snare, 
Or shatter too with him my curious frame, 
And let these wither—so that he may die— 
Though set with skill, and chosen out with care ; 
That they, while thou on both their spoils dost tread, 
May crown Thy feet, that could not crown Thy head. 
 
 
BERMUDAS 
 
Where the remote Bermudas ride  
In the ocean’s bosom unespied,  
From a small boat, that rowed along,  
The listening winds received this song.  
 
"What should we do but sing his praise  
That led us through the watery maze,  
Unto an isle so long unknown,  
And yet far kinder than our own?  
Where he the huge sea-monsters wracks,  
That lift the deep upon their backs,  
He lands us on a grassy stage,  
Safe from the storms, and prelate’s rage.  

He gave us this eternal spring,  
Which here enamels everything,  
And sends the fowl to us in care,  
On daily visits through the air.  
He hangs in shades the orange bright,  
Like golden lamps in a green night,  
And does in the pom’granates close,  
Jewels more rich than Ormus shows.  
He makes the figs our mouths to meet,  
And throws the melons at our feet,  
But apples plants of such a price,  
No tree could ever bear them twice.  
With cedars, chosen by his hand,  
From Lebanon, he stores the land,  
And makes the hollow seas, that roar,  
Proclaim the ambergris on shore.  
He cast (of which we rather boast)  
The gospel’s pearl upon our coast,  
And in these rocks for us did frame  
A temple, where to sound his name.  
Oh let our voice his praise exalt,  
Till it arrive at heaven’s vault:  
Which thence (perhaps) rebounding, may  
Echo beyond the Mexique Bay." 
 
Thus sung they, in the English boat,  
An holy and a cheerful note,  
And all the way, to guide their chime,  
With falling oars they kept the time.  
 
A DIALOGUE BETWEEN SOUL AND BODY 
 
     SOUL 
O who shall, from this dungeon, raise  
A soul enslav’d so many ways?  
With bolts of bones, that fetter’d stands  
In feet, and manacled in hands;  
Here blinded with an eye, and there  
Deaf with the drumming of an ear;  
A soul hung up, as ‘twere, in chains  
Of nerves, and arteries, and veins;  
Tortur’d, besides each other part,  
In a vain head, and double heart.  
 
     BODY 
O who shall me deliver whole  
From bonds of this tyrannic soul?  
Which, stretch’d upright, impales me so  
That mine own precipice I go;  
And warms and moves this needless frame,  
(A fever could but do the same)  

And, wanting where its spite to try,  
Has made me live to let me die.  
A body that could never rest,  
Since this ill spirit it possest.  
 
     SOUL 
What magic could me thus confine  
Within another’s grief to pine?  
Where whatsoever it complain,  
I feel, that cannot feel, the pain;  
And all my care itself employs;  
That to preserve which me destroys;  
Constrain’d not only to endure  
Diseases, but, what’s worse, the cure;  
And ready oft the port to gain,  
Am shipwreck’d into health again.  
 
     BODY 
But physic yet could never reach  
The maladies thou me dost teach;  
Whom first the cramp of hope does tear,  
And then the palsy shakes of fear;  
The pestilence of love does heat,  
Or hatred’s hidden ulcer eat;  
Joy’s cheerful madness does perplex,  
Or sorrow’s other madness vex;  
Which knowledge forces me to know,  
And memory will not forego.  
What but a soul could have the wit  
To build me up for sin so fit?  
So architects do square and hew  
Green trees that in the forest grew.
