Shakespeare, Sonnets 
 
I 
 
 From fairest creatures we desire increase, 
 That thereby beauty's rose might never die, 
 But as the riper should by time decease, 
 His tender heir might bear his memory: 
 But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes, 
 Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel, 
 Making a famine where abundance lies, 
 Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel: 
 Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament, 
 And only herald to the gaudy spring, 
 Within thine own bud buriest thy content, 
 And, tender churl, mak'st waste in niggarding: 
 Pity the world, or else this glutton be, 
 To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

 Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest 
 Now is the time that face should form another; 
 Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest, 
 Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother. 
 For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb 
 Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry? 
 Or who is he so fond will be the tomb 
 Of his self-love, to stop posterity?  
 Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee 
 Calls back the lovely April of her prime; 
 So thou through windows of thine age shalt see, 
 Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time. 
 But if thou live, remember'd not to be, 
 Die single and thine image dies with thee. 
 
 XII 
 
 When I do count the clock that tells the time, 
 And see the brave day sunk in hideous night; 
 When I behold the violet past prime, 
 And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white;  
 When lofty trees I see barren of leaves, 
 Which erst from heat did canopy the herd, 
 And summer's green all girded up in sheaves, 
 Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard, 
 Then of thy beauty do I question make, 
 That thou among the wastes of time must go, 
 Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake 
 And die as fast as they see others grow; 

 And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence 
 Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence. 
 
XVIII 
 
 Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? 
 Thou art more lovely and more temperate: 
 Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, 
 And summer's lease hath all too short a date: 
 Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, 
 And often is his gold complexion dimmed, 
 And every fair from fair sometime declines, 
 By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:  
 But thy eternal summer shall not fade, 
 Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st, 
 Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade, 
 When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st, 
 So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, 
 So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

 A woman's face with nature's own hand painted, 
 Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion; 
 A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted 
 With shifting change, as is false women's fashion: 
 An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling, 
 Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth; 
 A man in hue all hues in his controlling, 
 Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth. 
 And for a woman wert thou first created; 
 Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting, 
 And by addition me of thee defeated, 
 By adding one thing to my purpose nothing. 
 But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure, 
 Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure. 
 
XXIX 
 
 When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes 
 I all alone beweep my outcast state, 
 And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, 
 And look upon myself, and curse my fate, 
 Wishing me like to one more rich in hope, 
 Featured like him, like him with friends possessed, 
 Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope, 
 With what I most enjoy contented least; 
 Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising, 
 Haply I think on thee, and then my state, 
 Like to the lark at break of day arising 
 From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate; 

 For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings 
 That then I scorn to change my state with kings. 
                                                            
                                                                 
XXX 
 
 When to the sessions of sweet silent thought 
 I summon up remembrance of things past, 
 I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought, 
 And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste: 
 Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow, 
 For precious friends hid in death's dateless night, 
 And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe, 
 And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight: 
 Then can I grieve at grievances foregone, 
 And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er 
 The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan, 
 Which I new pay as if not paid before. 
 But if the while I think on thee, dear friend, 
 All losses are restor'd and sorrows end. 
                                                            
                                                                 
XXXIII 
 
 Full many a glorious morning have I seen 
 Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye, 
 Kissing with golden face the meadows green, 
 Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy; 
 Anon permit the basest clouds to ride 
 With ugly rack on his celestial face, 
 And from the forlorn world his visage hide, 
 Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:  
 Even so my sun one early morn did shine, 
 With all triumphant splendour on my brow; 
 But out, alack, he was but one hour mine, 
 The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now. 
 Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth; 
 Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth. 
 
 
  LI 
 
 Thus can my love excuse the slow offence 
 Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed: 
 From where thou art why should I haste me thence? 
 Till I return, of posting is no need. 
 O! what excuse will my poor beast then find, 
 When swift extremity can seem but slow? 
 Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind, 
 In winged speed no motion shall I know, 
 Then can no horse with my desire keep pace. 

 Therefore desire, (of perfect'st love being made) 
 Shall neigh, no dull flesh, in his fiery race; 
 But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade- 
 Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow, 
 Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go. 
                                                             
                                                                  
LIII 
 
 What is your substance, whereof are you made, 
 That millions of strange shadows on you tend? 
 Since every one hath, every one, one shade, 
 And you but one, can every shadow lend. 
 Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit 
 Is poorly imitated after you; 
 On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set, 
 And you in Grecian tires are painted new:  
 Speak of the spring, and foison of the year, 
 The one doth shadow of your beauty show, 
 The other as your bounty doth appear; 
 And you in every blessed shape we know. 
 In all external grace you have some part, 
 But you like none, none you, for constant heart. 
                                                             
                                                                  
LIV 
 
 O! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem 
 By that sweet ornament which truth doth give. 
 The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem 
 For that sweet odour, which doth in it live. 
 The canker blooms have full as deep a dye 
 As the perfumed tincture of the roses, 
 Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly 
 When summer's breath their masked buds discloses: 
 But, for their virtue only is their show, 
 They live unwoo'd, and unrespected fade; 
 Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so; 
 Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:  
 And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth, 
 When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth. 
                                                             
 
LV 
 
 Not marble, nor the gilded monuments 
 Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme; 
 But you shall shine more bright in these contents 
 Than unswept stone, besmear'd with sluttish time. 
 When wasteful war shall statues overturn, 
 And broils root out the work of masonry, 

 Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn 
 The living record of your memory. 
 'Gainst death, and all oblivious enmity 
 Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room 
 Even in the eyes of all posterity 
 That wear this world out to the ending doom. 
 So, till the judgment that yourself arise, 
 You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes. 
 
 
LXV 
 
 Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea, 
 But sad mortality o'ersways their power, 
 How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea, 
 Whose action is no stronger than a flower? 
 O! how shall summer's honey breath hold out, 
 Against the wrackful siege of battering days, 
 When rocks impregnable are not so stout, 
 Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays? 
 O fearful meditation! where, alack, 
 Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid? 
 Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back? 
 Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid? 
 O! none, unless this miracle have might, 
 That in black ink my love may still shine bright. 
 
 
LXXI 
 
 No longer mourn for me when I am dead 
 Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell 
 Give warning to the world that I am fled 
 From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell: 
 Nay, if you read this line, remember not 
 The hand that writ it, for I love you so, 
 That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot, 
 If thinking on me then should make you woe. 
 O! if, I say, you look upon this verse, 
 When I perhaps compounded am with clay, 
 Do not so much as my poor name rehearse; 
 But let your love even with my life decay; 
 Lest the wise world should look into your moan, 
 And mock you with me after I am gone. 
                                                             
                                                                  
 
LXXIII 
 
 That time of year thou mayst in me behold 
 When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang 

 Upon those boughs which shake against the cold, 
 Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. 
 In me thou see'st the twilight of such day 
 As after sunset fadeth in the west; 
 Which by and by black night doth take away, 
 Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.  
 In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire, 
 That on the ashes of his youth doth lie, 
 As the death-bed, whereon it must expire, 
 Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by. 
 This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong, 
 To love that well, which thou must leave ere long. 
 
 
XCIV 
 
 They that have power to hurt, and will do none, 
 That do not do the thing they most do show, 
 Who, moving others, are themselves as stone, 
 Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow; 
 They rightly do inherit heaven's graces, 
 And husband nature's riches from expense; 
 They are the lords and owners of their faces, 
 Others, but stewards of their excellence. 
 The summer's flower is to the summer sweet, 
 Though to itself, it only live and die, 
 But if that flower with base infection meet, 
 The basest weed outbraves his dignity:  
 For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds; 
 Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds. 
 
 
CVI 
 When in the chronicle of wasted time 
 I see descriptions of the fairest wights, 
 And beauty making beautiful old rhyme, 
 In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights, 
 Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best, 
 Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow, 
 I see their antique pen would have express'd 
 Even such a beauty as you master now. 
 So all their praises are but prophecies 
 Of this our time, all you prefiguring; 
 And for they looked but with divining eyes, 
 They had not skill enough your worth to sing: 
 For we, which now behold these present days, 
 Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise. 
                                                               
 
 

CVII 
 
 Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul 
 Of the wide world dreaming on things to come, 
 Can yet the lease of my true love control,  
 Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom. 
 The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured, 
 And the sad augurs mock their own presage; 
 Incertainties now crown themselves assured, 
 And peace proclaims olives of endless age. 
 Now with the drops of this most balmy time, 
 My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes, 
 Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme, 
 While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes: 
 And thou in this shalt find thy monument, 
 When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent. 
 
 CXVI 
 
 Let me not to the marriage of true minds 
 Admit impediments. Love is not love 
 Which alters when it alteration finds, 
 Or bends with the remover to remove: 
 O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark, 
 That looks on tempests and is never shaken; 
 It is the star to every wandering bark, 
 Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. 
 Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks 
 Within his bending sickle's compass come; 
 Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, 
 But bears it out even to the edge of doom. 
 If this be error and upon me proved, 
 I never writ, nor no man ever loved. 
 
 
 CXXIX 
 
 The expense of spirit in a waste of shame 
 Is lust in action: and till action, lust 
 Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame, 
 Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust; 
 Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight; 
 Past reason hunted; and no sooner had, 
 Past reason hated, as a swallowed bait, 
 On purpose laid to make the taker mad. 
 Mad in pursuit and in possession so; 
 Had, having, and in quest to have extreme; 
 A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe; 
 Before, a joy proposed; behind a dream. 
 All this the world well knows; yet none knows well 
 To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell. 
                                                               

 
 
CXXX 
 
 My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; 
 Coral is far more red, than her lips red: 
 If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; 
 If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. 
 I have seen roses damasked, red and white, 
 But no such roses see I in her cheeks; 
 And in some perfumes is there more delight 
 Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. 
 I love to hear her speak, yet well I know 
 That music hath a far more pleasing sound: 
 I grant I never saw a goddess go,  
 My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground: 
 And yet by heaven, I think my love as rare, 
 As any she belied with false compare. 
 
 CXXXVIII 
 
 When my love swears that she is made of truth, 
 I do believe her though I know she lies, 
 That she might think me some untutored youth, 
 Unlearned in the world's false subtleties. 
 Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young, 
 Although she knows my days are past the best, 
 Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue: 
 On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed: 
 But wherefore says she not she is unjust?  
 And wherefore say not I that I am old? 
 O! love's best habit is in seeming trust, 
 And age in love, loves not to have years told: 
 Therefore I lie with her, and she with me, 
 And in our faults by lies we flattered be. 
 
 
CXLIV 
 
 Two loves I have of comfort and despair, 
 Which like two spirits do suggest me still: 
 The better angel is a man right fair, 
 The worser spirit a woman coloured ill. 
 To win me soon to hell, my female evil, 
 Tempteth my better angel from my side, 
 And would corrupt my saint to be a devil, 
 Wooing his purity with her foul pride. 
 And whether that my angel be turned fiend, 
 Suspect I may, yet not directly tell; 
 But being both from me, both to each friend, 
 I guess one angel in another's hell: 
 Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,  
 Till my bad angel fire my good one out. 
  

CXLVI 
 
 Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,  
 Feeding these rebel powers that thee array, 
 Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth, 
 Painting thy outward walls so costly gay? 
 Why so large cost, having so short a lease, 
 Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend? 
 Shall worms, inheritors of this excess, 
 Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end? 
 Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss, 
 And let that pine to aggravate thy store; 
 Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross; 
 Within be fed, without be rich no more: 
 So shall thou feed on Death, that feeds on men, 
 And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.
