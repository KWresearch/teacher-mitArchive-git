ON THE GRASSHOPPER AND THE CRICKET 
 
THE poetry of earth is never dead:  
     When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,  
     And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run  
From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;  
That is the Grasshopper's–he takes the lead  
     In summer luxury,–he has never done  
     With his delights; for when tired out with fun  
He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.  
The poetry of earth is ceasing never:  
     On a lone winter evening, when the frost  
     Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills  
The Cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever,  
     And seems to one in drowsiness half lost,  
     The Grasshopper's among some grassy hills. (1816)  
 
 
IN DREAR-NIGHTED DECEMBER 
 
IN drear-nighted December,  
Too happy, happy tree,  
Thy branches ne'er remember  
Their green felicity:  
The north cannot undo them  
With a sleety whistle through them;  
Nor frozen thawings glue them  
From budding at the prime.  
 
In drear-nighted December,  
Too happy, happy brook,  
Thy bubblings ne'er remember  
Apollo's summer look;  
But with a sweet forgetting,  
They stay their crystal fretting,  
Never, never petting  
About the frozen time.  
 
Ah! would 'twere so with many  
A gentle girl and boy!  
But were there ever any  
Writhed not at passed joy?  
The feel of not to feel it,  
When there is none to heal it  
Nor numbed sense to steel it,  
Was never said in rhyme.  
 

WHAT THE THRUSH SAID 
 
'O thou whose face hath felt the Winter's wind, 
Whose eye has seen the snow-clouds hung in mist, 
And the black elm tops 'mong the freezing stars, 
     To thee the spring will be a harvest-time. 
O thou, whose only book has been the light 
Of supreme darkness which thou feddest on 
Night after night when Phoebus was away, 
     To thee the Spring shall be a triple morn. 
O fret not after knowledge–I have none, 
And yet my song comes native with the warmth. 
O fret not after knowledge–I have none, 
     And yet the Evening listens. He who saddens 
At thought of idleness cannot be idle, 
And he's awake who thinks himself asleep.' 
 
WHEN I HAVE FEARS 
 
WHEN I have fears that I may cease to be  
     Before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain,  
Before high piled books, in charact'ry,  
     Hold like rich garners the full-ripen'd grain;  
When I behold, upon the night's starr'd face,  
     Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,  
And think that I may never live to trace  
     Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance;  
And when I feel, fair creature of an hour!  
     That I shall never look upon thee more,  
Never have relish in the faery power  
     Of unreflecting love!--then on the shore  
Of the wide world I stand alone, and think  
Till Love and Fame to nothingness do sink.  
 
 
LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCI 
 
O, WHAT can ail thee, Knight at arms,  
     Alone and palely loitering;  
The sedge is wither'd from the lake,  
     And no birds sing.  
 
O, what can ail thee, Knight at arms,  
     So haggard and so woe-begone?  
The squirrel's granary is full,  
     And the harvest's done.  
 
I see a lily on thy brow,  
     With anguish moist and fever dew;  
And on thy cheek a fading rose  
     Fast withereth too.  
 

I met a Lady in the Meads  
     Full beautiful, a faery's child;  
Her hair was long, her foot was light,  
     And her eyes were wild.  
 
I made a Garland for her head,  
     And bracelets too, and fragrant Zone;  
She look'd at me as she did love,  
     And made sweet moan.  
 
I set her on my pacing steed,  
     And nothing else saw all day long;  
For sideways would she lean, and sing  
     A faery's song.  
 
She found me roots of relish sweet,  
     And honey wild, and manna dew;  
And sure in language strange she said,  
     "I love thee true."  
 
She took me to her elfin grot,  
     And there she wept and sighed full sore,  
And there I shut her wild sad eyes  
     With kisses four.  
 
And there she lulled me asleep,  
     And there I dream'd, Ah Woe betide,  
The latest dream I ever dreamt  
     On the cold hill side.  
 
I saw pale Kings, and Princes too,  
     Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;  
Who cry'd--"La belle Dame sans merci  
     Hath thee in thrall!"  
 
I saw their starved lips in the gloam  
     With horrid warning gaped wide,  
And I awoke, and found me here  
     On the cold hill side.  
 
And this is why I sojourn here,  
     Alone and palely loitering;  
Though the sedge is wither'd from the lake,  
     And no birds sing.  
 
 
ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE 
 
MY heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains  
     My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,  
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains  

     One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:  
'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,  
     But being too happy in thine happiness,--  
         That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees  
       In some melodious plot  
     Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,  
       Singest of summer in full-throated ease.  
 
O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been  
     Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth,  
Tasting of Flora and the country green,  
     Dance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth!  
O for a beaker full of the warm South,  
     Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,  
        With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,  
        And purple-stained mouth;  
     That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,  
        And with thee fade away into the forest dim:  
 
Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget  
     What thou among the leaves hast never known,  
The weariness, the fever, and the fret  
     Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;  
Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,  
     Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;  
         Where but to think is to be full of sorrow  
       And leaden-eyed despairs,  
     Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,  
         Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.  
 
Away! away! for I will fly to thee,  
     Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,  
But on the viewless wings of Poesy,  
     Though the dull brain perplexes and retards:  
Already with thee! tender is the night,  
     And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,  
         Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays;  
       But here there is no light,  
     Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown  
      Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.  
 
I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,  
     Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,  
But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet  
     Wherewith the seasonable month endows  
The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;  
     White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;  
         Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves;  
        And mid-May's eldest child,  
     The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,  
The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.  

 
Darkling I listen; and, for many a time  
     I have been half in love with easeful Death,  
Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme,  
     To take into the air my quiet breath;  
Now more than ever seems it rich to die,  
     To cease upon the midnight with no pain,  
         While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad  
        In such an ecstasy!  
     Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain--  
To thy high requiem become a sod.  
 
Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!  
     No hungry generations tread thee down;  
The voice I hear this passing night was heard  
     In ancient days by emperor and clown:  
Perhaps the self-same song that found a path  
     Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,  
         She stood in tears amid the alien corn;  
       The same that oft-times hath  
     Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam  
         Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.  
 
Forlorn! the very word is like a bell  
     To toll me back from thee to my sole self!  
Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well  
     As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf.  
Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades  
     Past the near meadows, over the still stream,  
         Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep  
       In the next valley-glades:  
     Was it a vision, or a waking dream?  
     Fled is that music:–Do I wake or sleep?  
 
 
ODE ON A GRECIAN URN 
 
THOU still unravish'd bride of quietness,  
     Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,  
Sylvan historian, who canst thus express  
     A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:  
What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape  
     Of deities or mortals, or of both,  
         In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?  
     What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?  
What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?  
         What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?  
 
Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard  
     Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;  
Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,  

     Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:  
Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave  
     Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;  
         Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,  
     Though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;  
She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,  
         For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!  
 
Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed  
     Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;  
And, happy melodist, unwearied,  
     For ever piping songs for ever new;  
More happy love! more happy, happy love!  
     For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,  
         For ever panting, and for ever young;  
     All breathing human passion far above,  
That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd,  
         A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.  
 
Who are these coming to the sacrifice?  
     To what green altar, O mysterious priest,  
Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,  
     And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?  
What little town by river or sea shore,  
     Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,  
         Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?  
     And, little town, thy streets for evermore  
Will silent be; and not a soul to tell  
         Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.  
 
O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede  
     Of marble men and maidens overwrought,  
With forest branches and the trodden weed;  
     Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought  
As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!  
     When old age shall this generation waste,  
         Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe  
     Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,  
"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,--that is all  
         Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."  
 
ODE ON MELANCHOLY 
 
NO, no, go not to Lethe, neither twist  
       Wolf's bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine;  
Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kiss'd  
       By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine;  
Make not your rosary of yew-berries,  
       Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be  
   Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy owl  
A partner in your sorrow's mysteries;  

       For shade to shade will come too drowsily,  
   And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.  
 
But when the melancholy fit shall fall  
       Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud,  
That fosters the droop-headed flowers all,  
       And hides the green hill in an April shroud;  
Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,  
       Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,  
   Or on the wealth of globed peonies;  
Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,  
       Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave,  
   And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes.  
 
She dwells with Beauty--Beauty that must die;  
       And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips  
Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh,  
       Turning to Poison while the bee-mouth sips:  
Ay, in the very temple of delight  
       Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine,  
   Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue  
       Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine;  
His soul shall taste the sadness of her might,  
   And be among her cloudy trophies hung.  

ODE: TO AUTUMN 
 
SEASON of mists and mellow fruitfulness,  
       Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;  
Conspiring with him how to load and bless  
       With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run; 
To bend with apples the moss'd cottage trees,  
       And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;  
   To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells  
       With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,  
And still more, later flowers for the bees,  
Until they think warm days will never cease,  
   For Summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.  
 
Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?  
    Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find  
Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,  
    Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;  
Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,  
     Drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hook  
     Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers;  
And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep  
     Steady thy laden head across a brook;  
     Or, by a cyder-press, with patient look,  
  Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.  

Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?  
       Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,-  
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,  
       And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;  
Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn  
       Among the river sallows, borne aloft  
   Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;  
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;  
       Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft  
       The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;  
   And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.  
 
 
BRIGHT STAR 
 
Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art---  
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night  
And watching, with eternal lids apart,  
Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,  
The moving waters at their priestlike task  
Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,  
Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask  
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors---  
No---yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,  
Pillowed upon my fair love's ripening breast,  
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,  
Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,  
Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,  
And so live ever---or else swoon to death.1  

                                                 
1In manuscript, this verse ran: “Half-passionless, and so swoon to death.”
