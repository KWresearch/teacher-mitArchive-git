FIRST ASSIGNMENT (due October 4th) 

Metaphors (and similes) use the qualities of one thing to discuss the qualities of 
another or to display them in an unusual way.  Poems may be metaphors as well as use 
them; as in the poem that we read by Sylvia Plath (“Metaphors”), the poem may not 
explicitly refer to its subject, but one is expected to recognize the real subject (guess the 
riddle) nonetheless.  Or a poem may explicitly refer to its subject but subordinate such 
references to discussion of or argument about another subject.  Let us call the actual 
subject of a poem (or of a part of a poem, a metaphor or simile, let’s say) the “tenor” and 
the subject to which it is compared and which is more largely discussed or treated the 
“vehicle”.  In this way, Donne’s talk in certain poems about geographical discoveries, 
exploration and mapping are a vehicle for discussing features of erotic experience.   
The use of the terms “tenor” and “vehicle” point to the possibility that referring to 
one thing by way of another may be something other than a convenience of exposition 
through analogy–that there may be something inherently difficult in referring directly to 
the tenor of a poem.  The question seem usually in place–why the detour?  What attitude 
towards the tenor is communicated by choice of vehicle?  (We might ask what attitude 
towards pregnancy is communicated by the poem “Metaphors”?  Is the poem an 
elaborate joke?  Is it a complaint?  Why give the poem the title “Metaphors” rather than 
the title “Pregnancy”?)   If you describe the poem carefully, you will observe such things 
as the number of statements, their order, how they are distributed within or between 
lines, whether the metrical scheme enhances or works against the natural rhythms of 
emphasis imposed by the meaning of words, the usual associations of component 
expressions–pleasant, interesting, dull, unpleasant–and all of this in a context of 
considering the order of statements, how they add up to something–an argument, an 
exposition, a question, a pattern of thought.  Does the end follow the beginning?  By 
continuous progression or abrupt transition?  Or does the order turn on itself at some 
point, quarreling with its own beginning?  What are the stages, the division into parts of 
the whole?  Do the stanzas, quatrains, couplets support this division or disturb it, and if 
the latter, why?  (In this context, you might try to account for the position in “Metaphors” 
of the first line, the fourth, the eighth and the ninth.)  You also want to look out for 
potential oddities–e.g., by asking yourself whether the “I” referred to in the first line the 
poet or the poem?  
In fulfilling this assignment you are not expected to address such questions 
directly–they are to inform your thinking about the poem or poems that you choose to 
write about–but some of them may well be worth addressing explicitly in your essay. 

The Assignment: 

Write an argumentative, analytic essay, running to five pages (use the word-count and 
figure on 320 words/page)  which (1) identifies the subject and mode of discourse 
(argument, description, discussion–whatever) of either one or two poems by either 
Shakespeare or Donne, perhaps offering as well an effective paraphrase, and (2) which 
elucidates the ways in which specific words, images and formal devices in the two 
poems contribute to understanding the view of the subject proposed by the poem.  The 
title-page should not be part of your page count and should reproduce the poem or 
poems in question.
