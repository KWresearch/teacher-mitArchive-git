THIRD ASSIGNMENT (DUE DATE: Nov 15th) 

The assignment, much like the second, is to provide a reading of a poem or poems 
chosen from (a) or (b) below.  If you write upon more than one poem under option (a), 
your analyses need not include a comparison of the poems. If you chose option (b), your 
paper will have also to do with a comparison of each poem’s attitude towards similar 
themes. The paper will be five pages in length, determined as before, by estimating 320 
words/page.  Pages will be numbered and the cover (whose contents will not count in 
the enumeration of words) will display the poem or poems that are the subject of your 
analysis.  There is one limitation upon choice of topic: you may not choose to write again 
about a poem upon which you have written already this term. 

There is a further requirement: at some point in the paper you are to provide a 
paraphrase of the poem or poems that you are discussing.  A paraphrase is a summary 
recasting in your words of what the sentences or sections of the poem are saying.  For 
this purpose, you become the voice of the poem, introducing the paraphrase by some 
such phrase as “The poem may be paraphrased as follows”.  The paraphrase may be 
more or less an abridgement of the original, depending upon how many sentences of the 
original it covers in each sentence of its own, and each sentence of a paraphrase is 
customarily followed by a parenthesis, denoting the lines that it refers to, thus: (ll. 5-8). 
In making a paraphrase, be aware of the difference between the abridgement effected 
by the paraphrase and the details of the original.  

As I announced in class, consultation with tutors will be for the purpose of rewriting a 
tutor-approved revision of the second paper.  This revision will aim simply at improving 
the prose—it does not concern your views of the poems, which may remain unchanged 
in your revised version even though my remarks indicated criticism of them.  Your 
contact with a tutor should begin with an exploratory session, in which you discuss my 
notations with the tutor.  The tutors will not award a grade for the revised paper but will 
simple approve it for submission to me.  This revision may be handed it at any time must 
be submitted by the Tuesday after the Thanksgiving break.  There will be no 
advancement of grade fro this revision.
