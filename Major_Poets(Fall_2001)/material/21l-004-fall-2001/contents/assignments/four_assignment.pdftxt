FOURTH ASSIGNMENT   


The fourth paper will be due on December 14th (Friday), deposited in my mailbox  no later than 2 PM. 
 Anyone  wishing an extension must request one by e-mail.  In no cases will extensions be granted later than 
Tuesday, December 18th, at 2 PM.  Papers must be submitted in hard copy.  In this case, it will not be 
necessary to supply copies of the poems discussed. 

The paper should be eight pages long, that is to say, about 2800 words in length. This number 
may include quotations essential to your discussion but not extensive quotations of stanzas or of entire 
poems.  Use the character-counting feature on your word-processing program to obtain the number of 
words and print the number on your title page.  One further requirement.  Please number the pages of your 
essay–it will make it easier for me to refer to your work in writing my commentary.

 

TOPICS 

1.  Of some lines of Wordsworth’s Coleridge remarked in a letter:  “I should have recognized them 
anywhere; and had I met these lines running wild in the deserts of Arabia, I should have instantly 
screamed out, “Wordsworth!”  Comment on the work of any poet that we read this term after Milton from 
the standpoint of metaphor, theme, situation and/or view of life, in a way that would lead a reader to 
identify the work as characteristic of the poet in question.  During the course of your exposition be 
specific at length in reference to the text of at least three of the author’s poem.  

2.  Alternatively compare the work of any two poets, one of which must be a poet whose work we read 
after we read Keats. 

3.  Compare at length one poem by each of two or three authors whose work or works usefully compare 
with one another from the standpoint of theme, situation, or view of life.  The idea here is to identify 
difference despite similarities and so highlight the salient characteristics of each.  At least one of the poets 
in question should be chosen from among those that we read this term after Keats.  Here are some 
suggestions: 
Wordsworth’s Tintern Abbey with Coleridge’s Frost at Midnight or Yeats’s Prayer for my 
Daughter.
 Keats’s Ode on a Grecian Urn with Wallace Stevens’s Sunday Morning.
 Wordsworth’s Solitary Reaper with Stevens’s Idea of Order at Key West
  Milton’s Lycidas and Stevens’s Sunday Morning (from the standpoint of religious images now 
treated as myths) 
Keats’s Nightingale, Yeats’s Among School Children, Wordsworth’s Immortality Ode
 Keats’s Nightingale with Frost’s Stopping by Woods and Come In
 Donne’s The Good Morrow with Larkin’s Aubade.  (An aubade is a poem about day-break) 
  Frost’s view of Nature with that of practically anybody else. 
Wordsworth’s Tintern Abbey with Frost’s Directive
 Arnold’s Dover Beach with Stevens’s Ideas of Order at Key West
 Wordsworth’s Three Years She Grew with Stevens’s Emperor of Ice-Cream
 Keats’s In Drear-Nighted December and Stevens’s The Snow Man
 Auden’s Lullaby with Yeats’s Prayer for My Daughter
 Yeats’s Sailing to Byzantium and Keats’s Ode on a Grecian Urn
 Donne’s Nocturnal on St Lucy’s Day with any poem by Stevens or Frost 
Frost’s The Most of It and/or Come In and Wordsworth’s It is a Beauteous Evening 

This list does not include much by Auden or Larkin (neither does it mention Eliot’s Love Song of J. 

Alfred Prufrock but I shall offer some suggestions about these poets as we read them. 

4.  Or you might want to compare three (or even four) short poems that share a theme or subject matter 
but treat the theme or subject matter each in its own way, absorbing it into a different view of life, as for 
example, one sonnet each from any three or four authors or these short poems about clothing–Donne’s 
Elegy XIX, Jonson’s Still to be Neat, Yeats’s A Coat, Wilbur’s Love Calls us to Things of this World.  Or 
you might want to write about any three or four poems that center upon a bird.  Once again, any 
discussion must include a work by at least one author read after Keats.   
5.  For those made desperate by the above choices, a last option is to provide a detailed analysis of any 
poem of at least sixty lines.  Your choice is limited to the work of Wordsworth and the works of those 
poets that we read after reading Wordsworth.
