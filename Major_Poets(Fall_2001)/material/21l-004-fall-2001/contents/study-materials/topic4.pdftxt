Topics for Discussion: 

1.  Milton’s Lycidas was condemned by Samuel Johnson as insincere.  “Where there is leisure for 
fiction there is little grief.  When Cowley [a poet contemporary with Milton] tells of Hervey that 
they studied together, it is easy to suppose how much he must miss the companion of his labors, 
and the partner of his discoveries;  but what image of tenderness can be excited by these lines? 
[Johnson then quotes ll.  26-29.]  We know that they never drove (sheep) a-field, and that they 
had no flocks to batten;  and though it be allowed that the representation may be symbolic of 
something, the true meaning is so uncertain and remote that it is never sought because it cannot 
be known when found.” 
Right or wrong in his judgment, Johnson raises important points.  The death of Edward 
King is the occasion of the poem, but is the loss of King to Milton its real subject?  The poem is a 
form of pastoral elegy, in which, in ancient Greek and Roman examples poet-shepherds spent 
their time while watching over their sheep by singing about his loves and the landscape, and their 
songs also involved serious subjects–the nature of leadership, politics, the course of empire, as 
well as the seasonal character of life, the inevitability of death.  In the early Italian renaissance 
and it much of the English poetry that took its works for models, the shepherds stuck to love and 
landscape, and whiling away time as the sheep browsed.  (Perhaps you can see why such a form 
was congenial to courtiers, whose real trade–the fighting of wars–was an intermittent occupation.)  
What use does Milton make of the Shepherd metaphor?  What is the relation of the apparently 
degressive passages (concerning Apollo and St Peter, ll 64-84 and ll. 103-131) to the theme?  An 
important feature of pastoral was its commitment as a form of fiction to the idea that simple 
people, like shepherds, had a purer relationship to Nature than more complicated types and that 
Nature was a beneficial power.  Note that in Lycidas the speaker acknowledges difficulty in 
maintaining the pastoral note, which is interrupted by verses about Apollo and St Peter; when the 
note is finally resumed (l.  132) it leads to a suggestion that the pastoral fiction of Nature in 
mourning for the dead shepherd as “false surmise.” For all Johnson’s criticism, then, Milton 
seems himself to be quarreling with his pastoral machinery.  Again, what is the role of Nature in 
the poem?  Some of the poem is about premature endings; a lot of it is about water.   What can 
the image of “drowning” stand for, besides drowning?  The poem is divided into something like 
paragraphs; how does this division function?  Discuss the shifts in tone in this poem.  How are 
they marked?  What do the last eight lines do for the tone of the whole?  Another difficulty– 
careful reading will show that it is not always clear who is speaking.  Various mythological 
figures appear who speak of King in the third person, but one voice (e.g., ll 100-102: It was that 
fatal and perfidious bark . . .) addresses King directly.  Whose voice is it?  Note that we have a 
third-person ending, though the poem begins in the first person, with the shepherd speaking.  
How do you account for this lack of symmetry?  Johnson also objected to the mixture of pagan 
and Christian materials in this poem.  Is there evidence that the poet mixed them consciously and 
for a purpose? 

2.  On his blindness, if properly punctuated, turns out to be one sentence. Does this matter to the 
understanding of the poem?  What is the parable of the talents to which it refers?  How can 
Patience prevent a murmur that has already been murmured? Or has it?  What is the force of the 
final word, wait?  How does it fit in with the parable of the talents alluded to earlier in the poem? 

3.  The sonnet Methought I saw has the familiar ambiguity of dividing up into both 
quatrains/couplet and octet/sestet.  What is the force of the division with regard to the content of 
the units in either case?  What is the meaning of “fancied sight”?  (We must recall that Milton 
was blind at the time.)  Does “fancied” refer to the fact that in the dream, his wife is veiled and he 
cannot see her face or to the fact that he has been given sight in the dream and can see her face?  
Are there problems with either interpretation?  What difference does the issue here make to the 
meaning of the poem?
