FIGURES OF SPEECH 

We begin our questions by introducing some terms that designate important feature of poetic language, all 
of which are departures from either literal expression or straightforward grammatical arrangement of 
words.  The name given these features are traditional, sometimes dating back to antiquity.  Do not let their 
strangeness put you off;  they are merely conveniences of reference.  The features to which they refer 
contribute powerfully to the effects of poetic utterance and will be at the focus of our attention from time 
to time as we analyze specific texts. 

   Metaphor: Refering to one sort of thing as if it were another. 
   Simile: Explicit comparison of one thing to another; sometimes omitted from the list of tropes on 
grounds that by stating the comparison it does not turn language oddly.
   Synecdoche: A whole is represented by naming one of its parts, aspects or features, namely, the 
part, aspect or feature marking its distinction from others of its kind in the context of the speech-act–e.g. 
He’s got a new skirt [girl-friend; context=gendered humanity]; He lives three doors down [house; 
context=entrances]; They hired three hands at the factory [workers; context=kinds of employee]; The ham 
sandwich wants another coffee [restaurant customer; context=selection from menu].  In addition to part 
for whole, synecdoche is sometimes held to include substitution of cause for effect or effect for cause, 
container for content [Have another cup], content for container [I hit him with the milk], and signifier for 
signified [I pledge allegiance to the flag . . . ]. There is some debate whether to regard synecdoche as a 
basic figure or just a sub-class of metonymy.
   Metonymy: Reference to something or someone by naming an attribute or something regularly 
associated with it in context. [He is the power behind the throne, The White House refused to comment, 
The pen is mightier than the sword, She just adores Shakespeare,  If you read this line/Remember not the 
hand that writ it.]
   Personification: Reference to abstractions or inanimate objects as though they had human qualities 
or abilities.  (also called “Prosopoeia”):  Information wants to be free.
   Catachresis: Reference to one thing as another when no proper term for the thing exists or a 
metaphor that has lost its metaphoric character through long use and is taken as a proper term.  The leg of 
a table, the mouth of a river, the aftermath of war [from the preterite of the Anglo-Saxen “mowen”, to 
mow a field; the mathe was the stubble left over after the mowers had done their job.]
   Onomatopoeia: Use of words whose sound correspond with their semantic value.  The buzzing of 
innumerable bees.  The murmurous haunt of flies on summer’s eves. 
Inversion: reversal of usual or conventional word order; in poetry, often used to deliberately 
suggest an alternative meaning.  Behold yon simpering dame/ Whose face between her forks presages 
snow . . . (King Lear) 
   Chiasmus: Repetition of grammatical structures in reverse order or of words in successive clauses 
in reverse grammatical order.  An example that includes both: Forgive me, Father, for my sins, and for my 
mercies, bless me.

EXPOSITING A POEM 

An essay in exposition of a lyric poem should aim at elucidating the text, offering paraphrases of its 
passages in some detail and a summary of the point made by the whole, as if the poem was an argument, a 
plea, a prayer—a piece of writing designed to have an effect on the reader. ( Jacobson’s short essay, The 
Speech Event and the Functions of Language offers a convenient  summary of the effects that an utterance, 
written or spoken, can be expected to have upon its recipient by virtue of its linguistic character.)  

Poetry’s way with words is not straightforward, however; it deploys the figurative resources of language 
to produce effects that are not duplicated by paraphrase or even approximated by it.  Hence paraphrase 
always serves the function of interpretation, and interpretation is always arguable—that is, it offers to suit 
the poem better than other interpretations, possible but (in your view) less plausible.  An exposition is 
therefore a species of argument, and it is useful to keep in mind, when possible, alternative views about 
the meaning of the poem and how it works; this will help give an edge to your exposition. 

A theme is a general sort of abbreviated argument, belief or opinion that characterizes the 
content of any piece of writing by paraphrasing it, saying what it is about.  Single phrases, 
verses, stanzas or a poem as a whole may have a theme.  A more general term is motif (also 
called a topos), which refers not only to themes, but also to parts of themes and also to devices, 
turns of phrase, or references to persons and agencies (such things as fate, chance, kings and 
desperate men) either simply repeated or developed through the work.  (Any motif insistently 
repeated  is called a leitmotif).  While motif is more general, theme is more inclusive or “higher” 
in reference, designating the over-all argument or point that a work is making, but the two terms 
overlap in usage.  For example, two common poetic themes in the tradition of Western poetry 
are the theme “ubi sunt” [Latin for “where are”, as in “Where are the flowers of yesteryear?”] and 
the theme “carpe diem” [Latin for “seize the day”, as in Herrick’s To the Virgins].  They are also 
common motifs.  Any expository account of a lyric poem will refer to themes and motifs in 
discussing the poem’s thematic development. 

Poems, like expository writings, develop in various ways according to the argument or thesis 
under consideration.  They can pass from the general to the specific, from the specific to the 
general;  they can enumerate a rapid series of statements to a conclusion or explore the variety 
of implication in a presiding metaphor; they can circle around their point or work progressively 
towards it, by building upon disparate examples or upon examples increasing in intensity.  It 
would be a question calling for critical decision, for example, whether the quatrains of Donne’s 
Batter my Heart call upon progressively more violence to resolve the difficulties of the situation 
from which the poetic voice speaks; discussion this point would be a likely element in an 
exposition of the poem. 

In expositing a poem, it is often useful to mention the obvious, especially when the obvious may 
go unnoticed.  For instance, the Donne sonnet, If poisonous minerals, turns from direct 
questions in the octet to a rhetorical question at the outset of the sestet, and this is important 
enough to call for explicit notice in any account of the poem.  The example also raises two 
further issues–in discussing the poem’s structure, it is important to note whether or not the poem 
has a fulcrum, a point of transition that is decisive for exacerbating or resolving the tensions set 
up by the thematic development up to that point, and whether it has an adequate resolution, that 
is, a pay-off statement (so to speak), in the form of a statement at or near its conclusion.  
Shakespeare’s final couplets often surprise by providing only a commonplace at the end—the 
pay-off line comes earlier.  It is often a question, too, in short lyrics, whether the fulcrum and the 
pay-off coincide. 

Discussion of lyric poetry requires notice of metaphor—how it works, drawn from what domain 
of experience and applied easily, as a virtual commonplace, or unusually, to the domain of 
experience that is the subject-matter of the poem.  A further question is whether the metaphors 
“add up”—that is, whether they have behind them a presiding metaphoric conception and if so, 
whether this perception is well-established in common speech or is somewhat unusual.  
Shakespeare’s sonnet 73, for example, employs the commonplace  notions (a) that the span of 
human life is a year and  that it can  be divided into seasons; (b) that the span of life is a day 
and can be divided into familiar periods, like, morning, noon, evening or twilight; and (c) that life 

or vitality is heat or fire (or sometimes illumination).  In the equation “Life is fire”, the domain 
represented by “fire” is called the source domain or sometimes the vehicle (that which is used to 
talk about something else) and the time of life is called the target domain or sometimes the tenor 
(that which is actually the subject under consideration).   An analysis of the poem would try to 
explore the connections among its three commonplaces.  Does the poem treat them quite 
independently?  Does one provide easy transition to another?  In contrast, the first two-thirds of 
Donne’s Hymn to God My God, in my Sickness draws  upon the unusual presiding metaphoric 
conceptions  “a human being is a musical instrument” and “a human being is a map”.  These are 
variants upon the more commonplace conceptions “the soul is harmony” and “life is a journey” 
but not identical with them. Moreover, the nature of the relation between the two  metaphoric 
ranges is not immediately clear, and neither is the range of metaphors occupying the last third of 
the poem. 

In dealing with this poem, we labor under an added difficulty: the pay-off line is a paradox that 
would be accepted by Donne’s contemporary readers as a commonplace—they might have 
trouble explaining it, but it would not have seemed to them an unexpected thing to say about 
God.  Any account of this poem would have to elucidate this last line, and to do so in such a 
manner that what precedes the last line will fall into place behind it.  Mention of paradox at this 
point may remind us of one more feature that should be noticed in analyzing a poem–its 
capacity to offer puzzles, sometimes not obviously.  The last couplet of Shakespeare’s first 
sonnet offers an obvious puzzle in sorting out the grammar.  Donne’s sonnet 14 offers a subtle 
puzzle in line 11 with the word “again”—when had the knot been broken before?  And why 
“broken”; why not “untied”?  Sometimes an odd word in a poem is just a convenience of speech, 
to fit out the rhythm or the meter, but sometimes the puzzle it poses is important.  Part of the job 
of an elucidation is to note puzzles and tie their resolution to the general run of exposition.

NOTES ON PROSODY 

Meters are based upon stressed and unstressed syllables.  Some prosodists argue that it is 
enough to distinguish four in order to derive the rest as combinations thereof, and so why clutter 
the mind with a number of odd-sounding names?  But I add two more (spondee and 
amphibrach) to the initial four, because I find them useful:

When you’re lying awake, with a dismal headache, and repose is taboo’d by anxiety, 
                I think you may use any language you choose to indulge in without impropriety . . . 

also:  You’re the top/  You’re the Louvre museum;/  You’re the top/  You’re the Coluseum./

Stress is relative to its foot; an unstressed syllable in one foot can be more stressed than the 
stressed syllable in another foot, quite apart from changes in stress demanded by the meaning 
of the sentence.  (e.g., “It is not growing like a tree/ In bulk, doth make man better be.”)  The 
stressed is bears less of an accent than the unstressed not. 

Duration sometimes reinforces, sometimes contrasts with accent.  It is independent of 
typographic length, e.g., “picked” vs “odd”.   Try:  Now entertain conjecture of a time/  When 
creeping murmur and the pouring dark/ Fills the wide vessel of the universe. 

A caesura is a pause in the line when read aloud.  Fulke Greville’s Elegy for Sydney, whose 
caesuras in each pair of lines compare with those in the typical four-line stanza of Emily 
Dickinson: 

Silence augmenteth grief, —writing increaseth rage,/ Staled are my thoughts, which 
loved and lost —the wonder of our age;/  Yet quickened now with fire, —though dead with frost 
ere now,/  Enraged I write I know not what; —dead,  quick, I know not how. 

The Heart asks Pleasure—first— 
And then—Excuse from Pain— 
And then—those little Anodynes 
That deaden suffering— 

The word “enjambment” means “leg over”, as in “I threw my leg over the fence” and 
refers to a relation between two consecutive lines of poetry the first of which has no 
punctuation at its end to indicate completion of a thought and whose meaning cannot be 
understood without the words that initiate the second line.  The  word “verse” refers to an 
individual line of poetry and has the same origin as the “verse” in “reverse”–it comes 
from the Latin for the turn the plowman makes at the end of each furrow.  The word for a 
set of verses separated typographically from other sets in a form repeated in a poem is, 
of course,“stanza”, which means room in Italian (hence Marvell’s “we’ll build in sonnets 
pretty rooms”).
