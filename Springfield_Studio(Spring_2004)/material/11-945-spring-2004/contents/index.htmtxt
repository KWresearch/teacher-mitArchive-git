***** Course Description *****
The Springfield Studio is a practicum design course that focuses on the
physical, programmatic, and social renewal of an urban community in
Springfield, Massachusetts by combining classroom work with an applied class
project.Â The course content covers the areas of physical design/urban design
and the related analysis and planning tools used to understand and assess urban
conditions from a design and development perspective.Â Urban design issues are
investigated in the context of social and economic challenges within the
community.Â Thus, the course has dual goals:
   1. analyze physical conditions in the community, assess community need,
      propose physical design interventions; and
   2. assess community capacity and programmatic needs.
The ultimate goal is to explore the integration of social, programmatic and
physical development interventions in ways that reinforce community
revitalization efforts, and to apply this knowledge through the development of
a formal neighborhood revitalization plan that addresses community needs.
