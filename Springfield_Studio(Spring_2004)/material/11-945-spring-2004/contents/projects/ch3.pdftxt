This chapter presents an overview of  the Campus Concept 
from the formulations of  its guiding principals through general 
recommendations to facilitate the triple urban design plan presented 
in the chapter that follows.

To create this Concept, the Springfi eld Studio at the Department of  
Urban Studies and Planning at MIT spent three months researching 
the North End and interacting with its residents.  With the help 
of  staff  from the North End Outreach Network (NEON), the 
North End Campus Coordinator Ben Torres, and members of  the 
North End Campus Concept Committee, the students developed 
an understanding of  the community that included its strengths as 
well as the challenges it faces.  The class then used this image to 
create a conceptual vision for the Campus.  The multiple community 
organizations represented on the Campus Concept Committee gave 
valuable feedback at student presentations of  the Campus concept 
development on March 19th and April 15th.  Together, the students 
and community representatives came up with the guiding principles 
from which The Campus was born.

This is a major endeavor, which this plan breaks up into three 
implementation phases. 

 Phasing 

   1.  Short Term: Projects that can be completed  
        by the Campus Committee with available 
        resources in 6 months.

  2.  Medium Term:  Projects that can be 
        completed by the Campus Committee with 
        additional resources in 18 months. 

  3.  Long Term:  Projects that can be completed        
        with third party participation in 5 years.

 
The plan also divides the campus project into three physical areas: 
Plainfi eld Gateway and the Plainfi eld neighborhood; Thomas Street 
Passage through the Gerena School; and Thomas Street Placita and 
the Memorial Square neighborhood.  These three physical areas 
together establish an important link buttressed by two vital gateway 
spaces which draw activity onto Thomas Street.  These two gateways 
link the rest of  the North End to the Campus, connecting the 
neighborhood to its assets and resources, while also linking the two 
halves of  the North End.

Defining The Campus

The Campus will connect the North End by celebrating its history 
and culture while inviting newcomers and long-time residents to 
participate in the life of  the community.  It will accommodate 
services and opportunities that will allow North End residents to 
improve their lives.  In addition, the new Campus will enhance 
the link between the Memorial Square and Plainfi eld halves of  the 
North End.  This plan achieves these goals by reclaiming Thomas 
Street.  Until the construction of  I-91, Thomas Street ran from Main 
Street to Bernie Avenue, through what is now the German Gerena 
Elementary School.  

This plan proposes the recreation of  Thomas Street; a public promenade along 
which the community can meet, socialize, play, learn and activate change.  The 
main hallway and atrium of  the Gerena School, cur rently underutilized, will 
be revitalized and opened through the evening with a mixture of  fun and more 
serious public uses made possible through additional security measures.  Public art 
and histor y exhibitions will educate North End residents about past community 
victories, increasing their pride in the North End.  The new Thomas Street, 
anchored by the Thomas Street Placita to the east and the Plainfi eld Gateway to 
the west, will bring back an historic link through the highway and recreate the 
Gerena School as a center of  community life.

General Recommendations

Several imperative connecting elements of  The Campus should 
be introduced throughout the three spaces and phases, particularly 
at its edges where it interacts with the rest of  the neighborhood.  
These connecting elements can be clustered into the following three 
overarching recommendations.

General Recommendations

 
• The Campus should present an inviting    
   image of itself as a single cohesive place to 
   residents and non-residents that draws activity 
   into the campus.  

• The Campus should be safe and secure 
 
   and make people feel comfortable being there 
   at all times of the day or night.  

• The Campus should make pedestrian 
 
   movement easier and safer within the campus 
   itself, and between the campus and the sur-
   rounding areas.  

Image

The Campus should present an inviting image of  itself  as a single 
cohesive place to residents and non-residents that draws activity 
into the campus.  Essentially, presenting an image of  the campus 
involves marketing.  Successful marketing will make The Campus 
the fi rst place residents think of  when they want to interact with 
the community.  There are many ways to create this image and the 
North End should bring its creativity to this task to make the image 
distinctly its own.  Some suggestions to begin image-making include:

•  Name and Logo – The Campus should have a name that evokes 
the qualities of  the space and of  the North End.  It should 
have a logo for use on materials and signs that is immediately 
recognizable within the North End and throughout the region.  

•  Signage and appearance – Signs indicating where The Campus 
is and where the user is within it are essential to making The 
Campus welcoming and easy to use.  Decoration and design 
should be vibrant and consistent throughout the campus to make 
spaces pleasant, and to help users associate each part of  The 
Campus with the others as a single place.

•  Gateways – The Plainfield Gateway and Thomas Street Placita 
should function as gateways from the community into The 
Campus and on to Thomas Street.  The Gateway design should 
make the entrances to Gerena School on each side as visible as 
possible.  While their design does not have to include a physical 
gateway or arch, they should draw people into The Campus 
spaces with their own activities.  Thomas Street, within Gerena 
School should allow visibility along the main hall and should 
encourage movement into and through the central atrium.

This marketing approach can support the North End’s economic 
development goals if  applied to the neighborhood as a whole.  The 
North End already has a reputation as a center of  Latin culture in 
Western Massachusetts.  The community can capitalize on this with 
signage on I-91, gateway improvements at the northern and southern 
ends of  Main Street, and assistance to local businesses for regional 
advertising.

Safety

Personal safety is a top concern of  North End residents.  The safety 
of  public property, especially within the Gerena School, is also very 
important to the success of  The Campus.  Specific design elements 
that increase visibility and use can make The Campus safer.  The 
most effective way to keep the campus safe is to use it, and to 
provide amenities, activities, and programming that will ensure it 
is used throughout the day and into the night.  New commercial 
and residential development near campus areas can help maintain a 
vigilant presence in The Campus as well.  

The design of  The Campus should facilitate visibility of  all parts of  
the campus and should expose currently hidden areas.  Infrastructure 
such as bright security lighting, closed circuit television cameras, and 
police call boxes can also increase safety in public spaces.  Human 
resources, such as security patrols will be especially effective in 
making the campus safe.  Private security guards can accomplish 
this but residents should also make clear to the Springfield Police

Department that safety within The Campus is a priority that warrants 
additional policing effort.

These strategies would be effective for other areas in the North End.  
Increased police patrols, security lighting, and police call boxes would 
reduce the vulnerability of  pedestrians on Main Street and Birnie 
Avenue and other areas within the community.  Birnie Avenue, a 
particularly isolated road in the North End sandwiched between I-95 
and the railroad, could also benefit from inserting signs indicating the 
abutting Gerena School.

Movement

The Campus is a cohesive pedestrian place where a visitor can walk 
from any part to another along the Thomas Street spine.  All spaces 
within The Campus are within a 10- to 15-minute walk from all other 
spaces.  People should feel that getting around The Campus is easy 
and pleasant.  This can be accomplished through streetscape and 
traffic calming improvements along key vehicular and pedestrian 
routes within The Campus.  These improvements should have a 
consistent appearance to make navigation between different places 
easier, including a simulation of  a streetscape within the Gerena 

Plaza in San Juan, 
Puerto Rico

School.  Signage should direct users to The Campus resources they 
are looking for.  Street trees and other greenery will help make the 
trip pleasant.  Street furniture will offer welcome respites to the 
elderly and disabled and create gathering spaces throughout The 
Campus.  Regularly placed trash receptacles will help keep The 
Campus clean.

Traffic calming measures such as those shown above will help make 
key street crossings safer for pedestrians.  Traffic calming creates 
visual or physical obstacles that slow automobile traffic and make 
drivers more aware of  pedestrians.  Traffic calming is not meant to 
stop traffic or aggravate drivers.  It simply produces irregular road 
conditions such as rises in the road surface or shifting lanes that 
require drivers to slow down and take note of  their surroundings.  
Visual cues, such as distinctive paving or even a coat of  brightly 
colored paint can let drivers know that a certain stretch of  road is a 
space for pedestrians as well as for cars.  

Traffic calming and reclaimed intersections can improve circulation 
and pedestrian accessibility at several key locations throughout the 
North End.  In particular, Birnie Avenue, considered a particularly 
dangerous road, could benefit from raised intersections near the

entrance to the Gerena School parking lot, narrowed traffic lanes, 
and the opening of  Birnie to two-way traffic between Arch Street 
and the Gerena School would help slow traffic particularly during 
school hours.  With such safety and movement improvements, 
including finding alternative parking spaces, The Campus may 
someday be able to expand onto Birnie Avenue, where footbridges 
from Plainfield could lead to expanded Campus facilities such as an 
independent Teen Center and overflow community gardens.
