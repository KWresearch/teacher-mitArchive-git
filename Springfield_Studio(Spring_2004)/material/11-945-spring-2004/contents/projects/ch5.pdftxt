    5. Implementation
Challenges
The Campus plan builds on the work that has been done so far 
by the Campus Concept Committee comprised of  representatives 
from the North End Outreach Network (NEON), the New North 
Citizens Council, the Brightwood Health Clinic, area schools with 
a key role played by the Gerena Elementary School, the Spanish 
American Union, representatives from the Mayor’s offi ce and the 
Bay State Medical Center.  The Committee has recently hired a new 
Campus Coordinator, who is currently working under the guidance 
of  Peter Levanos of  the Gerena School and Milta Franco of  NEON.  
To ensure that the Campus plan evolves to meet the goals of  the 
larger community and that Thomas Street - the spine of  the Campus 
- is revived, the role of  the Campus Coordinator must grow with 
each phase.  It is imperative that the Campus organizational body 
remain a distinct identity from other service organizations in the 
neighborhood.  This section outlines implementation strategies to 
develop partnerships along with growing responsibility.

One of  the main challenges deals with resources.  In order to 
implement the plan, allocation of  monetary and human capital 
resources will be needed.  The Campus Committee may need 
state and city grants to fund new construction and improve 
existing infrastructure.  Due to the lack of  a strong Community 
Development Corporation in the North End, the Campus 
Committee will have to fi nd alternate partners or organizations to 
take over various responsibilities within the implementation plan.  
The current Step Up Springfi eld Campaign could be a unique way to 
partner with citywide institutions in a way that will assist the children 
of  the North End.  In addition, the Campus Committee will have 

This project’s evolution spans fi ve years and is divided into three 
phases.  Many of  the actions and partnerships will overlap within 
the defi ned phase cycles of: (1) the fi rst six months; (2) the next one-
and-a-half  years; and (3) the following three years.  Certain actions 
will be discrete or temporary, while others will involve long term 
work and maintenance.  To the benefi t of  the Campus plan, the 
North End has a large community of  “doers” and implementers.  
However, this community will face certain foreseeable hurdles in the 
implementation process.

established with the Parks Department over the years.  Not only does 
this body have general recommendations about how to make a park 
space more healthy and lively, but it also has resources that could be 
showcased within the placitas.  The Campus proposal recommends 
a transfer of  responsibilities for these outdoor areas to the Campus 
Committee, for the same reasons of  community ownership and care 
described above.  This transfer will relieve the Parks Department of  
the responsibility and maintenance of  the areas, freeing up a section 
of  their budget and manpower.  We suggest that the freed moneys 
be used to fund community projects throughout Springfield.  In 
addition, the Parks and Recreations Department could be a key player 
in securing items such as benches to line the promenade.

A Campus Center volunteer team will be needed similar to the ones 
set up in the Metropolitan District Commission of  Greater Boston 
and the Southwest Corridor Park projects.  This involves training 
community members, both youth and adults, to manage and clean 
Thomas Street and other proposed areas under the Campus Concept.

Caretaking is of  central importance to the success of  the plan. 
Responsibility and ownership are key in caring for an area, but these 
actions can only be supported by good partnerships.  Because the

North End is full of  thriving, active organizations, these can be seen 
as “growing” into the jurisdiction of  each other.  A key characteristic 
of  the Campus Center is that it will remain neutral by maintaining a 
broad public representation and recognizing the organizational and 
programmatic strengths of  each of  organization involved. 

Resources

The major resources will come from the self-knowledge of  the 
community.  Only the North End residents will know what will 
work and what is best for the health of  their community.  Certain 
spaces will encourage this growth, such as the family resource center. 
Adult education classes and social services which also help organize 
the community.  Key figures are needed to put this knowledge into 
action.

The activities of  the campus center outlined in this plan are too large 
for one person to handle.  The Campus Committee will need to hire 
sub-coordinators for the Campus Concept, a Business Coordinator 
to run the movie theater, café coop, art store and gym, an Arts

Director to run the art studio and promenade exhibits, and a Services 
Coordinator for training maintenance volunteers.  Furthermore, 
defunct organizations such as the CDC should be refashioned and 
revived to fit the goals of  the Campus Concept.  The SAU is already 
working on a housing strategy for the neighborhood in the form of  
a community land trust to help renters become owners.  This effort 
would dovetail perfectly with the building of  elderly apartments and 
shops along the placitas, making these spaces safer and warmer while 
serving the needs for housing in the neighborhood.  If  the Campus 
Committee works to get active members on the board of  the CDC 
some cohesive development in the interest of  the community could 
take off.

Indicators of Success

Often it is difficult to gauge whether or not a project has been 
successful or not.  Even if  most of  the project is successfully 
completed, it may seem to have been an overall failure.  To avoid 
this, it is important to establish actions and partnerships as key to 
the concept implementation, and establish these as milestones in the 
project.

These milestones need to be recognized and celebrated, particularly 
in a long term phased plan.  The key to establishing these milestones 
is the interpretation of  which actions could make or break the plan.  
It is essential that the implementation of  the Campus Concept 
focuses on celebrating as much as possible the strength of  the North 
End community and on keeping the moral of  the people involved 
strong.  This is particularly important when thinking of  a space that 
is being created for growing, learning, and connecting.
