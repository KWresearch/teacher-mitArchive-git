Plainfield Gateway

The western arm of  The Campus, much like the Thomas Street Placita 
eastern arm, must connect residents and workers from the western 
side of  the neighborhood to The Campus and the activity of  Thomas 
Street.  This draw can be accomplished by creating a center of  activity 
at the node where Gerena opens onto the Plainfi eld side of  the 
neighborhood, currently a landscaped yet awkward and non-navigable 
transitional zone which seems to sever Gerena from the neighborhood.  
The Chestnut, Gerena, and Brightwood Schools, the Brightwood 
Health Clinic, Kennefi ck Park, the future senior center at the old pool 
house, and the eastern edge of  Riverview Apartments are all within 
a 10-15 minute walk of  the western entrance to Gerena.  This space 
can capitalize on the fact that this side of  the neighborhood is felt by 
the residents to lack commercial activity, with the exception of  a small 
convenience story located within the Brightwood Health Clinic.

A typical scene . . .

at Plainfield Gateway would have children playing 
on the playground equipment during school hours 
and af ter school.  Sitting on the benches, parents 
and older siblings wait for the elementary school 
kids to get out of school.  The side gardens provide 
a shady area to sit on a sunny day and meander 
around the side of the school to garden plots 
cultivated by the students.  The other side the 
basketball court provides a space for older youth 
to play hoops.  The store and cafe at the opening 
onto Plainfield Street offer school and office 
workers an attractive place to enjoy their lunches 
and af ter-work time.

The phasing of  the transformation of  this space addresses these 
two issues of  location and retail.  In the short term, the Plainfield 
Gateway will form a center of  activity by linking the above resources 
and facilities around the western entrance to the Gerena School.  
In the longer term, activity can be concentrated in the Gateway by 
introducing commercial activity to Plainfield.

First Steps (phase one)

Much like the first steps at the Thomas Street Placita, simple signage, 
streetscaping, and security measures are the beginnings of  enhancing 
the Plainfield Gateway and the key facilities nearby.  Coordination 
of  these activities with other areas of  The Campus and the greater 
neighborhood will ensure consistency of  design.  Signs will be 
installed along Plainfield Street in front of  the entrance to the 
Chestnut School Parking lot, the Brightwood School, the Brightwood 
Health Clinic, and Kennefick Park, and in front of  the Gerena School 
entrance.  Street trees can be planted, street furniture installed, and 
sidewalks painted along the routes between these facilities.  The 
intersection at Plainfield Street and at Sanderson Street will be painted 
to alert drivers to the fact that this is a pedestrian area.  The Campus

Phase 1

Concept Committee should work in conjunction with the Springfield 
Department of  Public Works and each of  the school administrations 
to carry out these physical improvements.    

New activities will be introduced to the Plainfield Gateway alongside 
the western entrance of  the Gerena School.  Playground equipment 
will be installed in the area west of  the entrance beside the basketball 
court.  A garden walk will be installed in the area north of  the Gerena 
swimming pool.  Finally, the area between the Gerena pool and the 
railroad track fence will be developed as educational gardens.  Further 
security measures may include security lighting to increase visibility 
at night, police call boxes to enable pedestrians to report crimes and 
suspicious activity more easily, or closed circuit television cameras.

Growth and Experimentation (phase two)

In the second phase of  the Plainfield Gateway, more extensive traffic 
calming along Plainfield Street can include a raised intersection or 
crosswalk, neckdowns and chicanes, and pedestrian islands between 
travel lanes.  More dramatic streetscape improvements can also be 
made by using special pavings, more pleasing street lighting, and 
playful street furniture.  This experimentation stage could benefit 
from a traffic analysis done of  Plainfield Street done in partnership 
with or by the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission to determine the 
most effective routing strategy and healthy use of  space.

Expansion and Community Agency (phase 
three)

Two scenarios to liven the Plainfield Gateway are envisioned.  The 
first introduces commercial activity along the edges of  the Gateway.  
Plainfield residents have repeatedly expressed a desire for retail 
establishments west of  I-91.  One of  the few places the current 
zoning ordinance will allow commercial development is within the 
current parking area for the Chestnut School.  This scenario proposes 
development of  a three story mixed-use structure in the western 
portion of  the parking area, fronting on Plainfield Street and facing 
in towards the Gateway.  As envisioned, the building would contain 
a café and convenience store on the first floor, and elderly apartment 
housing on the second and third floors.  The architectural style of  
the building would respect the single-family residential aesthetic 
dominant in the area while acknowledging a need from group living 
accommodation, particularly within the elderly community.  Perhaps 
the pre–existing convenience store in Brightwood Clinic would 
relocate to the more spacious quarters on the Gateway.

The development would displace some parking currently used 
by teachers at Chestnut Middle School.  However, the increased 
pedestrian activity would provide increased security for people and 
cars.  For the few parking spaces lost, two potential solutions are 
available.  One is to create a 30-40 spot parking lot on the parcel 
across Plainfield Street from the Chestnut School parking area.  The 
other is to allow on-street parking along both sides of  Plainfield 
Street near the Chestnut School.  These spots would be close to the 
school, and parking along the street would create a buffer between 
automobile traffic and pedestrian activity.  The Campus Concept 
Committee could support and coordinate this project, but a third-
party developer, as suggested in the Implementation section of  the 
report, would be needed to carry it through.  

The second scenario involves shifting all Chestnut School parking 
to the larger northern area of  the Chestnut School parking lot.  All

parking currently located around the round-about between the 
Gerena and Chestnut Schools can be relocated to the larger parking 
lot by narrowing the parking spaces and adding another row of  
parking nearest the Chestnut school.  The area between the Gerena 
and Chestnut Schools could then be developed as a pedestrian-safe, 
grassy, Campus Quad where children from the two schools could 
hang out or play, and families and visitors to The Campus could enjoy 
the outdoor space.  Activity in this space would put many residents 
in contact with The Campus and help make it a true center for the 
community.

Strategies

Certain strategies need to be created to overcome these hurdles.  The 
first hurdle is the jurisdiction of  space in and around the Gerena 
School.  As the largest elementary school in Springfield, it is under the 
jurisdiction of  the Springfield Board of  Education.  Simultaneously, 
and thanks to the hard work of  many leaders within the community, 
the Gerena School is also a space “owned” by the community.  These 
two distinct jurisdictional zones need to be formalized so the space 
is neither neglected nor misused, and so this misunderstanding does 
not create tension between these two bodies.  Now that there is an 
organizational body to represent the community interests in the 
Gerena space through the Campus Center Coordinator, the distinct 
responsibilities of  the community can be clarified.  The phased 
proposal minimizes the “swing” space which will be shared between 
the community and the school, reducing the areas which tend to 
be unclear in terms of  responsibility and maintenance.  Both the 
community and the school will benefit from the latter effectively 
ceding space. For once the community will feel ownership and 
responsibility over the space, will invest and care for the facility, and 
will make it a safer and livelier space not only for themselves, but also 
for the school children.  

Employing ample security guards and looking after school areas in 
the evenings will be the responsibility of  the community.  A first 
step toward this understanding of  shared space involves extending 
an invitation to the school board to join the Campus Committee.  
Equally important, representatives from the Teachers Union or 
one teacher from each of  the neighborhood’s surrounding schools 
- Gerena, Chestnut, Lincoln and Brightwood - should attend the 
committee meetings and vocalize their visions and interests in the 
community space as an educational tool. 

to hire additional staff  to manage the overall project and ensure 
strong communication between all the stakeholders involved. One 
of  the stakeholders that might pose complex challenges is the Board 
of  Education.  The strict restrictions placed on the use of  school 
facilities and property, and the power of  the teachers union may 
impede or delay the implementation of  some aspects of  the plan.  
Jurisdiction over the proposed areas might also represent a roadblock 
between the Campus Committee and the schools.

A challenge that affects the North End beyond the conceptual is the 
lack of  younger generation representation in leadership positions. 
Although many steps have been taken to meet this challenge 
including hiring a Campus Coordinator, more work needs to be 
done. It is essential that the North End builds strong leaders at all 
ages to ensure that the great work being conducted now can be 
carried into the future.  Lastly, and not unlike most community 
plans, resident participation presents a challenge.  The North End 
community has to believe in The Campus concept and adopt the 
plan as their own in order for it to be successful.
