Assignment #2  
Urban Design Analysis 
Assigned: Thursday Feb 12   Due: Tuesday March 16 
 

 
The first phase of the class is focused on inventory and analysis.  This inventory involves the physical 
environment of the community and Gerena school site as well as the organizational and social fabric of 
the North End.  This assignment seeks to synthesize the information gathered during the field trip and 
to offer direction for follow-up questions and visits.  The goal is to record, represent and communicate 
what you have observed.  You will use tools such as drawing and photographing for this assignment 
and computer modeling and desktop publishing later in the semester. 
 
During the field trip, the class was divided into three teams.  These teams will remain together until 
this assignment is complete although you will see that there is some overlap in the information listed 
below. Because of this overlap and because some topics require more documentation, it is expected 
that there will be collaboration between teams to accomplish this work.   
 
In this assignment, you will be responsible for conveying your observations and interpretations 
regarding the following:  
 
Traffic/Pedestrians/Transit 
•  Main vehicular routes in and through the neighborhood 
•  Traffic congestion points/areas of perceived danger 
•  Main pedestrian routes in and through the neighborhood 
•  Barriers to pedestrian traffic (either physical or perceived emotional) 
•  Parking (on street and off street) 
•  Signage 
 
Urban Design/Architecture/Open Space 
•  Gateways to the neighborhood 
•  Open spaces (parks, playgrounds) 
•  Views 
•  Major destinations in neighborhood 
•  Vacant lots, undeveloped lots, parking lots, vacant buildings 
•  Monuments, symbols of the neighborhood, landmarks, historic structures 
•  Perceived clusters (areas with similar types of uses, architectural styles, etc.) 
•  Land use (probably already on GIS) 
•  Signage 
 
Economic and Social Activity 
•  Clusters of economic activity 
•  Clusters of social activity (“hang outs,” gathering areas, etc.) 
•  Vacant commercial buildings 
•  Major employers or destinations

The above lists are not definitive.  Please feel free to add additional information as you deem 
necessary.  
 
Techniques: 
 
On Thursday, February 19th, Andrew Grace, Senior Urban Designer at the Boston Redevelopment 
Authority, will be a guest in the class.  Mr. Grace will review various master plans, discuss drawing 
and analysis techniques, and offer advice on how to get started.   
 
At this point in the project, we encourage you to draw with markers or pencils on paper or trace paper 
in lieu of creating computer graphics.  These hand drawings can be scanned on the color scanner and 
used later; for now, we want you to focus on the content of the drawings and the information 
conveyed, rather than the sophistication of the drawing and polished quality. 
 
Materials you will need (throughout the semester): 
 
Sharpies (black markers) in a variety of widths 
Pilot pens in some different widths 
Drafting dots (tape) 
Color markers and perhaps color pencils 
Roll of white trace paper (minimum width of 24”) 
Engineering scale 
 
On Tuesday March 16th you will make a presentation of your urban design and analysis findings.
