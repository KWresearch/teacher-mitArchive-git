Assignment #1 
Summary of Previous Work 
Assigned: Tuesday Feb 3   Due: Tuesday Feb 24 
 

• 
• 

reviewing existing data, regulations and studies 
reviewing work done to date by students and the CRCP 

 
The work of the Springfield Studio builds on extensive ongoing work by students and the Center for 
Reflective Community Practice (CRCP).  In this first phase of the project--Inventory and Analysis--
students will collect and analyze data to better understand existing physical and social conditions in the 
community, local visions and goals, existing activities and plans, and key future opportunities. A key 
piece of this work is addressed in this Assignment #1: 
 

 
This review and summary of previous and ongoing work will supplement the physical and 
environmental surveying and mapping that will complete the Phase 1 inventory work. 
 
Because of the extensive amount of information available about Springfield and the North End, each 
student will not be asked to read all previous reports, studies, and data.  Instead, students will be 
assigned individual documents and will be asked to read and study these thoroughly and to prepare a 
short summary of key points. All of these documents can be found on Stellar in the “Materials” section 
under the topic, “North End Background Readings.” These summaries will be assembled into a 
reference document for the class. Summaries should be typed on 8-1/2 x 11 paper and should be no 
more than two pages long, except in extenuating circumstances.   The following information should be 
provided for each summary: 
 
•  name of report or document 
•  date of preparation 
•  client or organization commissioning study/report 
•  organization/person who prepared the report 
•  goals for the study 
•  key findings and prioritization, if given 
•  key recommendations 
• 
follow-up information on whether any actions have been taken on recommendations (you’ll have to 
get this through additional sources or phone calls…it probably won’t be in the report or document) 
•  name of student preparing summary 
 
You will be expected to make a brief presentation of your summaries on Tuesday February 24th during 
the class session on “Community Needs: Programming.”  Members of the client committee will attend 
the session and will offer feedback.
