       Springfield                         are introduced and discussed. A
                                           video offering background on
                                           Springfield will be viewed.

                                           analysis tools. Ways of seeing the
                                           built environment will be explored.
                                           This class will provide an overview
                                           of the built environment/
                                           architecture of urban neighborhoods
                                           and examine the changes that have
                                           occurred to these features during
                                           the 20th Century. We will examine
                                           the historic form of urban

                                           these features.

                                           In addition, we will discuss the
                                           nature of reflective practice and
                                           how the "observer" brings judgments
                                           and biases to his/her ways of seeing

                                           This class considers various methods

                                           institutional perspective. What
                                           community resources are available to
                                           support implementation of our plans?
                                           What supplemental resources might be
                                           needed?
                                           This class is the first of two class
                                           sessions that focus on possible

                                           This class will explore ways to

                                           a community's identity and sense of

                                           Students will make a presentation on
                                           Phase I analysis findings. This
                                           presentation will serve as a "dry

                                           later in the week. Students will
                                           assemble and present data working

                                           Discussion is intended to assist the
                                           students in codifying ideas,
                                           focusing on challenge areas, and
                                           moving toward project goals. At the
                                           completion of the presentations and
                                           discussions, students will be
                                           assigned to one of two teams to
                                           continue with Phases 2 and 3 of the
                                           work.

                                           Client presentations of Phase 1 will
                                           take place at some point during this
                                           week (a likely Thursday evening/

                                           Students will finalize client

                                           draft a schedule for the remainder
                                           of the semester.

                                           This working session will begin with
                                           a short recap of client feedback.
                                           (30 min.) Students will then use

                                           and set priorities. Mid-session, the
                                           two teams will present work plans
                                           and schedules for moving forward.
                                           Students will then use the remaining
                                           time to begin their conceptual
