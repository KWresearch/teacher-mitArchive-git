Problem  Set  Solution  1 

1 .   Consider  P  = {x   : Ax   5  b ,  x  2 0) ,   where  A  is  m  x  n .   Show  that  if 
x  is  a  vertex  of  P  then  we  can  find  sets   I and  J  with  the   following 
properties. 
(a)   I c { I , . . . , m } , J  c { I 7 . .. , n }  and  111 = IJI. 
(b )   A: 
is  invertible where  A: 
is  the  submatrix of A  corresponding t o  
the   rows  in  I and  the   columns in  J. 
( c )  x j  = 0  for  j  $- J  and X J   = (A:)-lb'  where b'  denotes the  restriction 
of  b  t o  the  indices  in  I. 
(Hint:  Consider  Q = { (x ,  s) : Ax + I s  = b ,  x  2 0 , s 2 O).) 
Using t h e  h in t  we  t u r n  our  a t ten t ion  t o  Q = { ( x , s)  : A x +  I s  = b ,  x  > 0, s 2 0) .  
If  we  let  ( x ,  s) be   a  pa ir   such  t h a t   x  E  P a n d   s  is  t h e   unique  vector  of  slack 
variables  associated  w i th   x  (s = b  - A x ) ,   i t   is  no t   h a r d   t o   show  t h a t   if  x  is  a 
vertex  of  P t h e n   ( x ,  s)  is  a  vertex  of  Q.  Assume  t h a t   x  is  a  ver tex   of  P b u t  
the re   is  a  (y ,  t )   such  t h a t   ( x ,  s)  &  (y ,  t )   E  Q  a n d   (y ,  t )   #  0.  T h e n   we  have 
A ( x  * y)  + (s h t )  = b , x  * y  2 0 , s  * t  2 0.  T h i s   implies  t h a t   A ( x  + y)   5 b 
a n d  A ( x  - y)  5 b.  Since  x  is  a  vertex,  th i s   implies y = 0.  T h e n   solving  for  t  in 
A x +   (s+ t )   = b  we  find  t h a t  i t  mus t   be  zero a s  well which  con trad ic ts   (y ,  t ) # 0. 
We  can   now  take   advan tage   of  t h e   fac t   t h a t   Q  is   in  t h e   special  form  (Ax   = 
b ,  x  2 0 ) .   If  ( x ,  s)  is  a  vertex  of  Q  t h e n   the re   is  a  subse t   B  c (1 , . . . , n + m }  
such  t h a t   1B1  = m  a n d  
( a )   ( x , s ) ~= 0 for N = { I , . . . , n + m ) \ B 
( b )   (A I  I)  is non   s ingu lar  

Let  J  c B  be   t h e  se t   of  columns  involving A  of  (A  I  I ) .  Notice  t h a t   if  I  JI  = k ,  k 
of  t h e  x  variables a re  basic  a n d  m - k  of  t h e  s variables a re  basic.  So x j  = 0 for 
j  $ J a n d  a n d   k  of  t h e  s variables a r e  zero.  We  take   t h e  rows  corresponding  t o  
t h e  zero  componen ts  of  s a s  t h e  se t   I .  T h e n  

a n d  A$  is  invertible,  so 

2. 	 In  his paper   in FOCS  92, Tomasz Radzik  needs a  result  of  t h e  follow- 
ing  form  (Page  662  of  t h e  Proceedings): 

Lemma  1 Let  c E Rn  and yk  E (0 ,  l I n f o r   k  = 1 , .  . . , q  such that 21yk+lcl 5 
Iykcl  f o r   k  = 1, . . . , q - 1.  Assume   that  ly,cl  = 1.  Then  q  5 f ( n ) .  

In   o the r   words,  given  any  set  of  n  (possibly negative)  numbers,  one 
cannot  find more t h a n  f ( n )  subsums of  these numbers which decrease 
in   absolute value  by  a  factor  of  a t  least  2. 
Radzik  proves  t h e   result  for  f ( n )  = O (n2log n )   and   conjectures  t h a t  
f ( n )   = O * ( n )   where  0* denotes  t h e   omission  of  logarithmic  terms .  
Using  linear  programming,  you  a r e   asked  t o   improve  his  result  t o  
f ( n )  = O ( n 1 o g n ) .  

( a )   	 Given  a vector  c  and  a  set  of  q  subsums satisfying t h e  hypothesis 
of  t h e   Lemma,  write   a  set  of  inequalities  in  t h e   variables  xi  2 
0, i  = 1 . .. n ,   such  t h a t   xi  = lcil  is  a  feasible  vector,  and   for  any 
feasible vector  x'  th e r e  is a  corresponding vector  d  satisfying t h e  
hypothesis  of  t h e  Lemma  for  t h e   same set   of  subsums. 
We have a se t  of inequalities of  t h e  form 2 1  yi+lcl  5  1  yicl for 1 <- i <- q - 1a n d  
lylcl  = 1, a n d  we  have  a  vector  c  which  satisfies  t h em .   To  ob ta in   a  l inear  
sys tem ,   we  need  t o   remove  t h e   abso lu te   value  signs.  Let  yi  = y i sgn (y ic ) .  
T h e n   lyicl  = yic.  T h e   sys tem   becomes  2yi+,c  5  y,!c  for  1 5  i  5  q - 1 
a n d   y ic  = 1 a n d   t h e   original  c  is  s t i l l  feasible.  To  l im i t   t h e   solution  space 
t o  vectors  of  t h e   form  x  2 0  a  similar  tr ick   is  used.  We  replace  elements 
c j  t h a t   a re   negative  by  - x j   a n d   non-negative  elements  by  x j .   T h e  linear 
sys tem   t h a t   remains  has   a  solution  x  2 0, namely  x j  = I  c j  1.  A  solution  c' 
t o  t h e  original inequalities can  be  ob ta ined  from any  feasible x  in t h e  newly 
cons truc ted   se t   of  inequalities  by  nega t ing   t h e  value  of  t h e   i t h  element  of 
x  if  t h e   i th  element  of  c was  negative.  Th i s   resu l ts   in   t h e  same  number   of 
inequalities  a s  we  h a d   originally, namely  q. 
( b )   	 Prove   t h a t  th e r e  must  exist  a  vector  d  satisfying t h e   hypothesis 
of  t h e   Lemma,  w i th   d  of  t h e   form  ( d l / d ,  d z / d ,  . . . , d n / d )   for  some 
integers  ldl, Id1 1 ,
  . . . , ldnl = 2O("logn). 
(Hint:  see Problem   1.) 
T h e   po ly tope   defined  by  t h e   inequalities  above  is   nonempty.  Th i s  means  
t h a t   t h e   po ly tope   has   a  vertex.  O u r   sys tem   looks  like Ax  2 b  a n d   x  2 0, 
where  A  is  a  q  by  n  m a t r i x   con ta in ing   entries  between  -3  a n d   3  (since 
every  en t ry   is  t h e   difference  of  two  integers,  one  being  &2   o r   0,  t h e   o the r  
being f1 or  0)  a n d  b  has   one  nonzero  element which  is f1 .   From t h e  first 
problem,  we  know  t h a t   t h e  nonzero  componen ts ,  say  y ,  of  a  ver tex   satisfy 

A'y  = b'  where  A'  is  an   invertible  subma tr ix   of  A  and   b'  is  a  subvector 
of  b.  Notice  t h a t   1det(Af) I  5  n!3"  = 2°(n  logn). As  in   class  (by  Cramer's  
ru le) ,   we  know  t h a t   we  can  set  d  t o   be   Idet(Af)I and   the   (nonzero)  di's 
t o   be  de term inan ts   of  submatrices  of  A'.  By  t h e   same  argumen t ,   these 
de term inan ts   are   also  upper   bounded  by  2'("l0gn),  proving  t h e   result. 
(c)  	 Deduce  from  t h e   above  t h a t   f ( n )  = O ( n  log n) .  
Multiplying  t h e   vector  d  by  d  yields  an   integer  solution  t o   2yl+,x  5 yix 
for  1 5  i  5 q  - 1 with  elements  of  value  20("1°gn).  Thu s   t h e   largest  sum 
t h a t   can  be  obtained  by  a  subset  is  2°(n10gn).  As  t h e  first  subset  sums t o  
a t  least  one  (since t h e  di's are   integers), t h e  number  of  times  t h e  sum  can 
double is  a t  most  O ( n  log n ) .  

3. 	 The   maximum  flow  problem  on  t h e   directed  graph  G  = (V,E) with  
capacity  function  u  (and   lower  bounds  0)  can  be   formulated  by  t h e  
following linear  program: 

max  w 

subject  t o  

(x i j   represents  t h e  flow  on  edge  ( i ,  j ) ;   t h e  flow  has  t o  be  less  or   equal 
t o  t h e   capacity  on  any  edge  and   flow  conservation  must  be   satisfied 
a t   every  vertex  except  t h e   source  s,  where  we  t r y   t o  maximize  t h e  
flow,  and   t h e  sink  t.) 

( a )   	 Show  t h a t   i ts  dual  is  equivalent  to: 

subject  t o  

Th i s  is a n  immediate consequence of  t h e  definition of  t h e  dua l .   If  one takes 
t h e  dua l   of  t h e   system  of  equations  and   inequalities  above,  then   one gets 

Since add ing  a cons tan t   t o  all z i 7 s  doesn't change  anything, we  can require 
t h a t   z,  = 0 and   zt = 1. 
( b )   A  cu t   is  a  set   of  edges  of  t h e   form  {(i ,j )  E  E  :  i  E  S,j  $  S)  for 
some S c V  and   i t s  value  is 

I t   separates   s from  t  if  s E  S and   t  $ S. 
Show t h a t   a  cu t   of  value  W  separating   s from t  corresponds  t o  a 
feasible  solution  (y ,  z )   of  t h e  dual  program   such  t h a t  

For  a  cu t   defined  by  S c V ,  we  define  zi  = 0  for  i  E  S, zi  = 1 for  i $ S, 
yij = 1 for  i  E  S,j  $ S, (i ,j )   E  E and   yij = 0 otherwise.  Obviously,  (y , z )  
is  a  feasible  solution and   i t s  value  is 

(c)  	 Given any   (not  necessarily  integral)  optimal  solution y*, z* of  t h e  
dual   linear  program   and   a n   op t ima l   solution  x*  of  t h e   primal  
linear  program,  show  how  t o  construct   from  r* a  cu t   separating  
s from  t  of  value  equal  t o  t h e  maximum  flow. 
(Hint:   Consider  t h e   cu t   defined  by  S  =  {i  :  zi  5  0)  and   use 

complementary  slackness  conditions.)  

We  divide  the   vertices  into  two  se ts  defined  a s  follows: 


Every  edge  ( i ,  j) with  i  E  S and   j  S satisfies  2,'  - 2;  + ytj  2 0.  Since 
2:  5 0 and  z j   > 0 we  have  t h a t   ytj > 0, which  by  complementary slackness 
implies  t h a t   x,*,= u:~.Every  edge  (j,i)  with  i  E  S and   j  $  S  satisfies 
z j   - z,'  + ~5~ > 0,  since  z j   > 0  and   z,'  5 0.  By  complementary  slackness 
we  have  t h a t  xji= 0.  Thu s ,  we  can write 

which  is  t h e  value  of  t h e  maximum  flow. 
( d )   	Deduce  t h e   max-flow-min-cut  theorem:  t h e   value  of  t h e   maxi- 
mum  flow  from  s  t o   t  is  equal  t o  t h e  value  of  t h e  minimum  cu t  
separating  s  from  t. 
From  (b) and  weak  duality, t h e  value  of  any  cu t   is  greater  or  equal t o  t h e  
maximum  flow  value.  By  t h e   analysis  above,  we  can  find  a  cu t   which  is 
equal  t o   t h e   maximum  flow.  Thus ,   t h e  minimum  cu t   value  must  be   t h e  
same  as  the  maximum  flow  value. 

4.  Consider  t h e  following property   of  vector  sums. 
Theorem  2  Le t   v l ,  . . . , vn  be  d - d im e n s i o n a l   v e c t o r s   s u c h   t h a t   llvi1 1   5 1 
fo r   i = 1,. . . ,n  (wh e r e   1 1 . 1 1   d e n o t e s   any  n o r m )   and  

T h e n  th e r e   e x i s t s   a   p e rm u t a t i o n   a  of  ( 1 , .  . . ,n )  s u c h   t h a t  

fo r   	 k  = 1,. . . , n .  

In   th is   problem,  you  a r e   supposed  t o   prove  th is   theorem   by  using 
linear programming  techniques. 

( a )   	 Suppose we  have  a  nested  sequence of  se ts  

where  lVkl= k  for  k  = d , d + l , . . . , n .   Suppose fu r the r  t h a t  we  have 
numbers  X k i  satisfying: 

for k  = d , . . . , n.  Define a p e rmu t a t ion  n a s  follows:  set  n ( l ) ,. . . , n ( d )  
t o  b e   elements  of  Vd  in  any   o rde r ,   and   set   n ( k )  t o  b e   t h e  unique 
element  in  Vk \ Vk-1  for  k  = d + 1,. . . ,n. 
Show  t h a t   th i s   p e rmu t a t ion   satisfies  t h e   conditions  of  Theo rem  
2. 
For  k  5 d , the   theorem  is trivial.  By  t h e  definition of  n and   X k i ,   for  k  > d 
we  have 

(b )   	 Show  t h a t   t h e r e   exist  X n i ,   i  = 1 . . . n ,   satisfying  ( I ) ,   (2)   a n d   (3) 
for  k  = n. 

We  choose  simply  


Then  

and  

(c)  	 Suppose  we have cons t ruc ted  V,,  . . . , 
and  X j i   for j  = k + l ,  . . . ,n 
a n d   i  E V, satisfying  (I), ( 2 )   a n d   (3) for  k + 1 , . . . ,n  (where  k  2 d ) .  
P rove  t h a t   t h e  following system  of  d + 1  equalities  ( ( 4 )contains  d 
equalities) ,  k  + 1  inequalities  a n d   k  + 1 nonnegativity   cons t ra in ts  
has  a  solution w i th  a t  least  one  Pi  = 0: 

Deduce  t h e   existence  of  t h e   nested   sequence  and   t h e   X's  a s   de- 
scribed  in   (a ) .  

By  t h e  induc t ion   hypothesis,  we  have 

k - d  
P i =   k + l - d   Xk+l,i 

satisfying ou r  inequalities, so t h e  po ly tope  of  feasible solutions is  nonempty. 
We  want  t o  find  a  solution  w i th   a t   least  one   zero  coord ina te .   Consider  a 
ver tex  of  t h e  po ly tope  a n d  suppose  t h a t  for each  i, Pi  > 0.  The re  a r e  k + 1 
coord ina tes   summ ing   u p   t o   k  - d ,  so  a t  most  k  - d  - 1  of  t h em   can   be  
equa l  t o  1. (If k - d coord ina tes  a re  equa l  t o  1, t h e  rest  is zero.)  Therefore 
we  have  a t   least  d + 2  coord ina tes   pi, 0  < Pi  < 1. Le t's  deno te   th i s   se t   of 
coord ina tes   by  J. T h e   corresponding  vectors  v j ,  j  E  J canno t   be   affinely 
independen t ,   so  the re   exists  a  linear  comb ina t ion  w i th   y # 0  such  t h a t  

For a  sma l l  enough  t > 0, we  ob ta in  two  feasible so lu t ions  by  replacing t h e  
coord ina tes  of  pj for  j  E  J by  Pj lj CTj,  which  con trad ic ts   t h e  assump t ion  
t h a t  ,Biis a  vertex.  Therefore a  vertex ha s  always a  zero  coord ina te  a n d  by 
removing  th i s   coord ina te   we  ob ta in   t h e   subse t   Vk  a n d   t h e   corresponding 
coefficients  X k i   = Pi  which  completes t h e  induc t ion .  

5 .   	Consider  the  following  optimization  problem  with  "robust  condi- 
t ions" : 

min{cTx  : x  E  Rn;Ax  > b  for  any  A  E  F), 
where  b  E  Rm  and  F  is  a set  of  m  x  n  matrices: 

F  = {A  : Qi, j ; amin < a i j  5 a c a x ) .
2J 	 -

( a )   	 Considering F  as  a  polytope  in  Rm X n ,what  are  the  vertices  of 
F? 
F is  a n   (rn x  n)-d imens iona l  p roduc t   of  intervals.  I t   has   2""  vertices  A@ )  
where  each  coord ina te   a:;) 
is  e i ther   a;'"  or   a;=. 
( b )   	 Show  that  instead of  the  conditions for  all A  E  F ,  it  is  enough to  
consider  the  vertices  of  F .   Write  the  resulting  linear  program. 
What  is  its  size? 

Suppose  t h a t   x  satisfies 

for  every  vertex  A(').  Any  A  E  F  can   b e   w r i t ten   a s   a  convex  l inear  
comb ina t ion  of  t h e  vertices: 

By  tak ing   t h e  corresponding  linear  comb ina t ion  of  inequalities  (w i th  non- 
negative  coefficients), we  get 

which  is 

Therefore  x  is  a  feasible solution  if  a n d  only  if  i t  satisfies t h e  condition  for 
every  vertex  of  F. We can  wr i te  t h e  op t im iza t ion  problem  in  t h e  following 
form: 

rnin{cTx  : V k ;A@ ) X   2 b ) .  
T h i s  is a linear program ;  however,  i t  ha s  a n  exponen t ia l  number  of  inequal- 
i t ies ,  namely  m2mn,in   n  variables. 
(c)  	 Derive a more efficient description of  the  linear program:  Write 
the  condition  on  x  given  by  one  row  of  A ,   for  all  choices  of  A. 
Formulate  this  condition  as  a  linear  program.  Use  duality  and 
formulate the original problem as a  linear  program.  What  is the 
size  of  this  one? 
Let  us  consider  a  fixed  vector  x.  I t   is  feasible  if  t h e   following  condition  is 
satisfied  for  each  row  a i   of  t h e  m a t r i x  A: 

We  can   regard  th i s   condition  a s  a  l inear  programm ing  problem: 

Note  t h a t   t h e  variables a re  now  a i j ,  while  x  is fixed!  By  dua l i ty ,  we  get  a n  
equivalent  condition  for  a  l inear  program  w i th   variables pi j 7 qij : 

T h i s  means   t h a t  x  is  feasible  if  the re   exist  p i j   2 0, qij  2 0  such  t h a t  

p i j  - qij = X j  

a n d  

All  toge the r ,  we  can  wr i te   our   op t im iza t ion   problem  a s  t h e   following: 

which  is  a  linear  program   in  variables X j ,  p i j ,  qij.  I t  has  2mn + n variables,
