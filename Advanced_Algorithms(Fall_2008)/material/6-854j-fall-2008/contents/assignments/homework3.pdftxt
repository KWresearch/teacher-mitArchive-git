1.  Consider  t h e  following optimization problem: 
Given  c  E Rn,  c 2 0,  n  even,  f ind  
n
min{cTx:  C , , ,x i   2 1  VS  c { I , . . . ,n ) ,   IS1 = 5, 

In  class,  i t   was  shown  t h a t   th is   can  be  solved  by  t h e  ellipsoid method  because 
there  is  a n   efficient  separation  algorithm.  However,  th is   problem  has  a  more 
straightforward  solution. 
Develop  an   algorithm  which  finds  t h e   optimum  in  O ( n  logn )   time.  Prove  i t s  
correctness. 

2 .   	 Fill a  gap  in  t h e   analysis of  the   interior  point  algorithm: 
Suppose t h a t   ( x ,  y, s) is  a  feasible vector,  i.e.  x  > 0, s > 0, 

and  we  perform  one Newton  s tep  by  solving for  A x ,  Ay ,  A s :

Prove  t h a t   if 
 

o ( x  + A x ,  s + A s ,  ,!A)  < 1 
 
then   (x  + A x ,  y  + A y ,  s + A s )   is  a  feasible  vector  for  Ax  =  b , x  >  0  and 
A T Y + s = c , s  > 0. 

3 b   	Given a directed graph  G = (V,E )  and  two vertices  s and t ,  we  d
d like  t o  
find  the  maximum number  of edge-disjoint  paths between  s and t  (two paths 
are edge-disjoint if  they  don't  share  an edge).  Denote  the  number  of  vertices 
by n and the number of  edges by m. 

(a )  Argue  that  this problem can  be  solved as a m h u m  flow  problem  with 
unit  capacitia.  Explain. 
proMan on directed graphs  G  (V,E )  
(b)  	 Consider now the mashurn ~ Q W  
=
with unit capacity edges (dthough some of  the questions below would also 
appIy  t o  the more general case). 
Given a feasible flow f ,we cm construct the m i d u a l  network Gf  = (V, E!) 
where 

The residual  capacity of an edge  (i, j )  E E f  is equal  to   - fV or  t o  fji
depending on t h e  case above.  Since we  are dealing with the  unit  capwits 
case,  an the q * ' s   a re   1 and therefore for 0- 1 flows f (i,e.  flows fo r  which 
the d u e  on any edge is 0 or  I),dl residual capwitia wilI be  I. 
We  d&e 
the distance of  .a vertex  If(v) as  t h e  Iengkh  of  the shortest path 
from s to  v  in Ep  (w for vertices which  are not  reachable from s in E f ) .

Further, d&e

residual capacities) such  that every  directed s - t  path in E l   has at least 
one saturated edge  (i.e. an edge whose  fiflow equals the residual capacity]. 
For  a unit  capacity graph and a given  0 - 1 flow  f, show how we  can  .find 
the  leverIIed  residual network and a saturatisg f law  in O (m )time. 
(c) 	 Prove that if the l e ~ 1 l e dreaidual network has no path from s t o  t ( k f  (t)= 
m) ,then  the  fiow f  iis mmhum.

(the distance from s to  5  in t h e   residual  network).  Prove  that  if g  is a 
saturating flow far f  then 

where f +g denotes the b w  obtained from f by either incr-
the flow 
f i j   by gij or  decreasing the flow  fjiiby gg  for e m  edge  (i, j )  E GI. 

(e)  Prove  t h a t   if  f  is a  feasible  0 - 1 flow  with  distance  d = d ( f )  and   f *  is  an 
op t imum  flow,  then  

and   also 

( f )   	 Design  a maximum flow  algorithm  (for un i t   capacities) which  proceeds  by 
finding  a  sa tu ra t ing   flow  repeatedly.  Try  t o   optimize  i t s   runn ing   t ime .  
Using t h e  observations  above, you  should  achieve a  runn ing  t ime  bounded 
by  o (min (mn2 I3 ,  m 3 I 2 ) ) .  
(g)  Can  we  now  justify  t h a t ,  for  0 - 1 capacities, there   is  always  an  op t imum  
flow  t h a t   takes  values  0  or  1 on  every  edge?
