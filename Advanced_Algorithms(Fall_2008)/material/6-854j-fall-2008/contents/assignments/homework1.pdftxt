3 .   	 T h e  maximum  flow  problem  on  t h e   directed  graph   G  = (V, E) with  capacity 
function  u  (and   lower  bounds  0)  can  be  formulated  by  t h e   following  linear 
program: 

subject  t o  

(x i j   represents  the   flow  on  edge  ( 2 ,   j); the   flow  has  t o   be  less  or  equal  t o   the  
capacity  on  any  edge  and   flow  conservation  must  be  satisfied  a t   every  vertex 
except  the   source  s ,  where we  t r y   t o  maximize  the   flow,  and  the   sink t . )

(b )   A  cut  is  a  set  of  edges  of  t h e   form  { ( i , j )  E  E  : i  E  S , j  $!  S) for  some 
S  c V  and   i t s  value  is 

I t   separates  s from  t  if  s E  S  and   t  $!  S .  
Show  t h a t   a  cu t   of  value  W  separating  s  from  t  corresponds  t o  a  feasible 
solution  y ,  x of  t h e  dua l  program  such  t h a t  

(c)  Given  any  (no t   necessarily  integral)  optimal  solution  	 y*, z*  of  the   dual 
linear  program  and   a n   op t ima l  solution  x* of  t h e   primal  linear  program, 
show  how  t o  construct  from  z* a  cut  separating  s  from  t of  value equal  t o  
the  maximum  flow. 
(Hint:  Consider the  cut defined by  S  = { i  :  5 0)  and  use complementary 
slackness conditions.) 
(d )   Deduce  t h e   max-flow-min-cut 	 theorem:  the   value  of  t h e   maximum  flow 
from  s  t o  t is equal  t o  the  value  of  the  minimum  cut  separating  s  from  t .  

4.  Consider  t h e  following property  of  vector  sums. 
Theorem 2  Let  u l ,  . . . , un  be  d- dimensional  vectors  such  that  llvi 1 1   5  1 for 
i = 1,. . . , n  (where  1 1  .I1  denotes any  norm)  and 

Then  there  exists  a permutation  ?r  of  (1, . . . , n )   such  that 

for 	 k = 1 , . . . , n .  

In  th is   problem,  you  are   supposed  t o   prove  th is   theorem  by  using  linear  pro- 
gramming techniques. 

(a )   Suppose we  have  a  nested  sequence  of  sets 

where  lVk 1  = k  for  k  = d ,  d + 1,. . . , n.  Suppose  fur ther   t h a t   we  have 
numbers  Xk i   satisfying: 

for  k  = d ,  . . . , n .   Define  a  permu ta t ion   n- a s  follows:  set  n-(1),. . . , a ( d )  t o  
be  elements  of  Vd  in  any  order,  and   set  a ( k )  t o  be  the   unique  element  in 
Vk  \VkP1  for  k = d +  1 , .  . . , n .  
Show  t h a t   th is  permu ta t ion   satisfies  t h e  conditions of  Theorem  2.

5.  Consider  the   following optimization problem  with  "robus t   conditions": 

min{cTx  : x  E  R n ;  Ax  2 b  for  any  A E  F ) ,   

where  b  E  Rm and  F is  a  set  of  m  x  n  matrices:  


F  = { A :  Vi, j ; a F n  <- a i j  5 azax} .  

(a )   Considering F as  a  polytope  in W X n ,what  are  the   vertices  of  F? 
(b )   Show t h a t   instead of  the   conditions for all A  E  F ,  i t   is enough  t o  consider 
the   vertices  of  F .   Write  the   resulting  linear  program.  W h a t   is  i t s  size?  Is 
arand   a y 7  
th is  polynomial in  the  size of  the   inpu t ,  namely m ,  n  and  the   sizes of  b,  c,
(c)  	 Derive a more  efficient  description of  the  linear program:  Write  the  condi- 
tion on x  given by  one row of  A,  for all choices of  A.  Formulate  th is  condi- 
tion  as   a  linear  program.  Use  duality  and   formulate  the   original problem 
as   a  linear  program.  W h a t   is  t h e   size  of  th is   one?  Is  th is   polynomial  in 
the   size of  the   inpu t?
