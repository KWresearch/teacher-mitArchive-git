1  Vertices  of  polyhedral  sets 

Last  time,  we  defined  the   v e r t e x   of  a  linear  program,  and   we  proved  one  direction  of  th e   theorem 
below  (see notes  on  Linear  Programming).  Now  we  prove  the   other  direction. 
Theorem 1  L e t   x  E  P ,   where   P  = {x  : Ax  = b , z   > 0 ) .   D e f i n e   Ax  as   t h e   s u bm a t r i x   of  A  of 
co lumn s   j  for  wh ich   x j   > 0.  T h e n  x  i s   a  v e r t e x   of  P  if  and   on ly   if  Ax  h a s   linearly   i n d e p e n d e n t  
co lumn s .  

Proof  of  Theorem  1:  Last  time  we  proved  t h a t   if  th e   columns  of  Ax  a re   linearly  dependent, 
then   x  is  not  a  vertex.  Now,  we  show t h a t   if  x  is no t   a  vertex,  then  t h e  columns  of  Ax  are  linearly 
dependent.  Assume  t h a t   x  is  not  a  vertex.  Then  by  the   definition  of  a  vertex,  3y  #  0  such  t h a t  
x + y , x - y   E  P.  This means  t h a t   A x + A y   = b a n d   A x - A y   = b,  so Ay  = 0 ,   and   a l s o x - y   > 0 
and  x + y > 0, therefore y j  = 0, for every j  such  t h a t   x j  = 0.  Thus ,  since y # 0, A,,  t h e  submatrix 
containing columns j  of  A  such  t h a t   g j  > 0, has  dependent  columns.  Since every column  in A,  is  a 
column  in  Ax ,  therefore Ax has  linearly  dependent  columns. 

2  Bases  and  basic  feasible  solutions 
Let  P = {x  : Ax  = b ,  x  > 0},  where A  is  an  m  x  n  matrix.  We  define  a  basis,  a  basic  solution, and 
a  basic  feasible solution  for P as follows: 
Definition  1  A  sub se t   B  of  { 1 , 2 , .  . . ,n}  of  size   m  i s   called  a  basis  if  AB,  t h e   m a t r i x   con s i s t ing   of 
co lumn s   of  A  t h a t   correspond  t o   t h e   ind ice s   i n  B ,  i s   inve r t ib le .  

Definition 2  A  vec to r   x  i s   called  a  basic  solution  t o  Ax  = b  if  and   on ly   if  the re   i s   a  basis  B  s u c h  
t h a t  

a  ABxB  = b,  o r   equivalently ,   XB   = A B ' ~ .  

Definition 3  x  i s   a basic feasible solution  if  i n  add i t ion   t o  t h e   cond i t ion s   above,  we  have  A B ' ~2 0. 

Without  loss of  generality,  we  can  assume  R ank (A )  = m  (A has  full  row  rank ) .   The   following 
lemma  shows a  correspondence  between  vertices  and  basic  feasible solutions  of  P. 

Theorem 2  Le t   A  be  a n  m  x  n  m a t r i x  w i t h  full  row  rank .   T h e n  for   eve ry   x ,   x  i s   a  basic  feasible 
so lu t ion   if  and   on ly   if  x  i s   a  ve r tex .  

Proof:  By  the  definition above, we  can  see t h a t   if  x  is a  basic  feasible solution, then  x  is a vertex. 
Also,  if  x  is a  vertex, we  show t h a t   it  is a  basic  feasible solution.  To  show th is ,  let  S = { j: x j  > 0) 
and  consider  three  cases: 
IS1  >  m .   This  case  cannot  happen  since  by  Theorem  1 columns  of  As  must  be  linearly 
independent,  bu t   the re  cannot  be more  t h a n  m  linearly  independent  columns. 

IS1  = rn.  In  th is   case,  we  a re   done  since  x  is  a  vertex  and   IS1  = m ,   so  x  is  a  basic  feasible 
solution  corresponding  t o  the   basis  S. 
IS1  < rn.  By  Theorem  1, t h e   columns  of  As  is  a  linearly  independent  subset  of  the   set  of 
columns  of  A.  By  basic  linear  algebra,  since the   rank  of  A  is  rn, we  can  augment  S t o  find  a 
set  AB  of  rn  linearly  independent  columns  of  A.  Now,  B  is  a  basis  and   x  is  a  basic  feasible 
solution  corresponding  t o  B.

correspond  t o   t h e   s am e   v e r t e x ,   we  say   we   have   degeneracy.

Theorem 3  If  rnin{cTx  : Ax  = b ,x   2 0)  i s  finite   ( n o t   unbounded ) ,   t h e n  for  eve ry   x  E  P ,   the re  
ex i s t s   a  v e r t e x  x'  E P ,  s u c h   t h a t  cTx' 5 cTx. 
Proof of Theorem 2:  If  x  is a vertex,  then we  a re  done.  Suppose x  is not  a vertex,  then  3y # 0, 
such t h a t  x + y ,x - y  E P .  Thus ,  Ay  = 0, and  y j  = 0 for  every j such t h a t   x j  = 0.  Assume cTy 5 0 
( the  case  cTy 2  0  is  similar).  Then,  for  every  X  > 0, A (x  + Xy)  = b  and   cT (x  + Xy)  5 cTx.  Also, 
since y j  = 0 for every j such t h a t   x j  = 0,  if  we  take X  = rn in j :y j<o+   > 0, we  will have x + Xy  2 0,
and   furthermore, th e   number  of  nonzero  entries  of  x  + Xy  is  a t   least  one  less  th an   th e   number  of 
Y j 
nonzero  entries  of  x .   Thus,  if  we  take   x'  = x + Xy,  then   x'  E P, cTx'  5  cTx, and   th e   number  of 
nonzero entries of  x' is a t  least  one less th an  t h a t  of  x .   Now, if  x' is a vertex, we  are done; otherwise, 
we  repeat  t h e  same process  on  x'.  Since this  process  decreases th e  number  nonzero  entries  of  x ,  we 
will  eventually  s top ,  i.e.,  we  will  find  a  x' t h a t   is  a  vertex. 
Corollary  4  If  P  = {x : Ax  = b ,  x  2 0)  # 8 ,   t h e n   the re   e x i s t s   a  v e r t e x   of  P .  

3  The  simplex method 

Theorem  3  shows t h a t   for  every  bounded  linear  program,  the re   is  a  vertex  of  th e   polyhedron  t h a t  
minimizes th e  objective function.  This is th e  main  idea behind  th e  simplex algorithm.  The  simplex 
algorithm  was  proposed  by  Dantzig  in  1947.  I t   focuses  on  vertices  t o   solve  linear  programming 
problems. 

Sketch of  the  algorithm: 

1. We  s t a r t  with  a  basis  B. 

2.  At  every  step,  if  we  can't prove t h a t   B is  optimum, we  replace  a  varible  in  B with  a  variable 
outside B ,  t o  obtain  another basis.  This process  is called p ivo t ing ,   and  i t   is done  according  t o  
a  p ivo t   rule .  

Simplex  algorithm  is  known  t o  work  very  well  in  practice.  However,  almost  for  every  known  pivot 
rule,  we  know  t h a t   the   worst  case  running  time  of  the   simplex  algorithm  is  exponential  (i.e.,  there 
is  an   example  on  which  the   simplex  algorithm  takes  an   exponential  number  of  steps  t o   find  the  
optimum).  We  do not  know  whether  the re  is  a  polynomial  time  simplex algorithm. 
The   complexity  of  th e   Simplex  algorithm  is  "related"  t o   t h e  Hirsch  conjecture,  which  says  the  
diameter  of  t h e  skeleton  of  a  polyhedron  in  Rd  with  n  facets is  a t  most  n - d. 

4  Duality  in  Linear  Programming 

We  know  from  basic  linear  algebra  t h a t   if  a  system  of  linear  equations  is  not  feasible,  then   i t   is 
possible  t o   get  a  contradiction  by  multiplying  each  equation  by  a  coefficient  and   adding  them  up. 
In other words, 

Theorem 5  E i t h e r  Ax  = b  h a s   a  s o l u t i o n ,   o r  ATy = 0,  bTy  f 0  h a s   a  s o l u t i o n ,   bu t   n o t   both. 

Th e  following theorem, known as Farkas' Lemma proves something similar for linear inequalities. 

Theorem 6  (Fa rka s '   L e m m a )   E i t h e r   Ax  = b,  x  2  0  h a s   a  s o l u t i o n ,   o r  ATy 2  0,  yTb < 0  h a s   a 
s o l u t i o n ,   bu t   n o t   both. 

I t   is  obvious  t h a t   bo th   cases  in  t h e   Farkas  Lemma  cannot  occur  a t   the   same  time,  so we  just 
have  t o  prove  t h a t   if  Ax  = b,  x  2 0  does  not  have  a  solution,  then   the re  is  a  y  such  t h a t   ATy 2 0 
and  yTb < 0.  This fact  is  usually  proved  using  th e   simplex  algorithm.  However, here we  present  a 
different proof  using  t h e  following lemma. 
Theorem 7  (P r o j e c t i o n   T h e o r em )  L e t  K  be  a  n o n e m p t y ,   closed  c o n v e x  s e t   in R n ,   and   b 4 K .   T h e  
p ro jec t ion   p  of  b  o n t o  K  is  a po in t   p  E K  t h a t  m i n i m i z e s  t h e   d i s tance   1 1  b -pll  . T h e n  for   e v e r y  x E K ,  
( b - ~ ) ~ ( x- P )   5 0. 

Proof: 
If  this  is  not  t ru e ,  by  moving  from p  a  little  bit  toward  x,  we  obtain  another  point  in  K 
t h a t   is closer  t o  b.  This is  a  contradiction  with  th e  definition  of  p.
