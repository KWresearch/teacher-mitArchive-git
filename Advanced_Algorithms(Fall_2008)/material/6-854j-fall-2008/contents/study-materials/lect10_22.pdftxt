In   t h e   last  lecture,  we  saw  a  cycle  canceling  algorithm  for  the   minimum  cost  circulation  problem. 
In  this  lecture  we  present  a  strongly  polynomial  time  algorithm.  This note  is mainly  based  on  the  
network  flows lecture  notes  of  previous  years. 

The  problem  of  finding  a  strongly  polynomial  algorithm  (and  even  i ts   existence)  for  t h e  minimum 
cost  circulation  problem  was  open  for  several  years.  In   1985, ~ v aTardos  developed  th e   first  such 
algorithm.  In   1987, Goldberg  and  Tarjan produced  an  improved  version presented  below. 

1  The  Goldberg-Tarjan Algorithm 

In  the   last  lecture, we  saw t h e  following algorithm. 

Goldberg-Tarjan algorithm: 

1 .   Let  f  = 0. 
2 .   While  p ( f )  < 0 do 
push  6 =  min  u f  (v,w)  along  a minimum  mean  cost  cycle  I?  of  G f .  
( w , w ) E ~  

The  Goldberg-Tarjan algorithm  is a  cycle canceling algorithm  since G  has a negative directed cycle 
iff  p ( f )  < 0. 

2  Analysis  of  the  Goldberg-Tarjan Algorithm 

Before  analyzing  th e  Goldberg-Tarjan  cycle canceling algorithm,  we  reveiw  some definitions. 
Definition  1  A  c i rcu la t ion   f i s  E - o p t im a l  if  the re   ex i s t s  p  s u c h   t h a t   cp(v,w)  > --E 
Ef 
For  -E  = 0,  we  know  t h a t   there  exist  potential p  such  t h a t   cp(v,w)   > 0  for  (v, w)  E  E f ,hence  a 
0-optimal circulation  is  a minumum  cost  circulation. 

for   all  (v, w)  E 

Definition 2  ~ ( f )= m i n i m u m  E  s u c h   t h a t   f  i s  e -op t ima l .   I n  o t h e r  words ,  
~ ( f )= m i n { ~I  3 p  : cp(v,w )   2  -E  V (v,W )E  Ef). 

In  th is  section, assume t h a t   all c (u , w)  a re  integers.  We  will  see noninteger  costs  in  this  lecture note 
bu t   not  in  th is  pa r t .   Also  we  have  th e  following theorems  which  were proved  in  t h e  last  lecture. 

Theorem 1  I f f   i s   a  c i rcu la t ion   w i t h  ~ ( f )< 

t h e n  f  i s   op t ima l .  

Theorem 2  For  any  circulation f ,  ,u(f )  = - € (  

f ) .  

We  a re  now  ready  t o   analyze th e   algorithm.  F i rs t ,  we  show  t h a t ,  using  E (  f )  as  a  measure  of  near-
optimality, th e  algorithm  produces  circulations which  a re  closer and  closer t o  optimal. 

Theorem 3  Let  f  be  a  circulation and  let f'  be  the  circulation obtained  b y   canceling  the  minimum 
mean  cost  c y c l e   r  in E f  .  Then E (  f )   E (  f '). 

Proof:  By  definition,  there  exists p such t h a t  

for all  ( v ,  w)  E  Ef.Moreover, for all  (u, w)  E  r , we  have  cp(v,w)  = - ~ ( f )since, otherwise,  i ts  mean 
cost  would  not  be  - e ( f ) .   We  claim  t h a t ,  for  th e   same p ,   ( I )  holds  for  all  (u, w)  E  E f1 .   Indeed,  if 
(u,W )E  E f 1  nE f  , (1) certainly holds.  If  (u, w)  E  E f I  \ E f  then   (w ,u)  certainly  belongs t o  r .  Hence, 
cp(v,w) = -cp(w,u)  = ~ ( f )2 0  and   (1) is  also satisfied. 
I7 
Next,  we  show t h a t   ~ ( f )decreases after  a  certain number  of  iterations. 

Theorem 4  Let  f  be  any  circulation and  let f '  be  the circulation obtained  b y  performing  m  iterations 
of  the  Golberg-Tarjan algorithm.  Then E (  f ')  5 ( 1  - A)€(  f ) .  
Proof:  Let p be  such t h a t   cp(v,w)  > - E (   f )  for all  (u, w)  E  E f  . Let  r; be th e  cycle canceled a t  the  
i t h  iteration.  Let  k be  the   smallest  integer  such  t h a t   the re  exists  (u, w)  E  rk+1with  cp(u,w)  2 0. 
We know  t h a t  canceling a cycle removes a t  least one a rc  with negative  reduced  cost from th e  residual 
graph and  creates only arcs with positive reduced  cost.  Therefore  k 5 m .   Let  f '  be th e  flow obtained 
a f te r  k iterations.  By  Theorem  2 ,   - c ( f f )   is  equal t o  the  mean  cost  of  rL+lwhich  is: 

where  1  = 

1 .   Therefore, by  Theorem 3 ,  after m  iterations, ~ ( f )decreases by  a factor of  (1- i). 

Assuming t h a t   all c ( u ,w)  a re  integers, we  have  th e  following theorem: 

Theorem 5  Let  C  =  max  Ic(u, w) 1 .   Then  the  Goldberg-Tarjan  algorithm finds  a  minimum  cost 
( v , w ) ~ E  
circulation after  canceling  nm  log (nC )   cycles  (log = log,). 
Proof:  The  initial circulation f  = 0 is certainly C-optimal since, for p = 0, we  have cp(u, w )   > -C. 
Therefore, by  Theorem  4, th e   circulation obtained after  n m  log n C  iterations  is  €-optimal  where: 

where we  have used  the  fact  t h a t   (1 - k ) n  < e-'  for all n  > 0.  The  resulting circulation is therefore 
I7 
optimal by  Theorem  1. 

The  overall running time  of  th e   Goldberg-Tarjan  algorithm  is  therefore O ( n 2m 2log (nC ) )  since the  
minimum  mean  cost  cycle  can be  obtained  in O ( nm )  time. 

3  Cancel and  Tighten Algorithm 

We  can  improve th e   algorithm  presented  in  the   previous  sections  by  using  a more  flexible  selection 
of  cycles for canceling and  explicitly maintaining potentials  t o  help identify  cycles for canceling.  The  
idea  is  t o  use  t h e  potentials  we  get  from  the   minimum  mean  cost  cycle  t o   compute  the   edge  costs 
cp(v, w)  and   then   push  flow  along  all  cycles with  only  negative  cost  edges.  The   algorithm  Cancel 
and  Tighten is  described  below. 

Cancel and  Tighten: 
1. Cancel:  As  long  a s  the re  exists  a  cycle  I' in  Gf  with  cp(u, w)  < 0, V(u, w)   E  r push  as much 
flow  as possible  along r. 
2 .   Tighten:  Compute a minimum  mean  cost  cycle  in  Gf  and  upda te   p. 

We  now  show t h a t  th e  Cancel  s tep  results  in  canceling a t  most  m  cycles each  iteration and  th e  flow 
i t   gives  is  (1- l / n ) ~ ( f )  optimal. 

Theorem 6  L e t   f  be  a  c i r c u l a t i o n   a n d   l e t   f '  be  t h e   c i r c u l a t i o n   o b t a i n e d   b y  p e r f o r m i n g   t h e   C a n c e l  
s t e p .   T h e n  w e   c a n c e l   a t   m o s t  m  c y c l e s   t o  g e t   f '  a n d  

Proof:  Let  p be  such t h a t   cp(v, w)  2 - ~ ( f )for  all  (v, w)  E Ef.Let  r be  any  cycle  in  f'  and   let  1 
be  the   length  of  r .  We  know  t h a t   canceling a  cycle removes a t  least  one  a rc  with  negative  reduced 
cost  from  t h e   residual  graph  and   creates  only  arcs  with  positive  reduced  cost.  Therefore  we  can 
cancel  a t  most  m  cycles.  Now  G f f  has  no  negative  cycles  therefore  every  cycle  in  G f l   contains  a n  
edge  (v, w)  such t h a t  cp (v ,  w )   2 0.  Hence t h e  mean  cost  of  r is  a t  least: 

The   above  result  implies  t h a t   th e   Cancel  and   Tighten  procedure  finds  a  minimum  cost  circulation 
in  a t  most  n log (nC )  iterations  (by a n  analysis which  is a  replication  of  Theorem 5 ) .  I t  also takes us 
O ( n )  time  t o  find  a  cycle on  the   admissible graph.  This implies t h a t   each  Cancel  step  takes O (nm )  
steps  due  t o  t h e   fact  t h a t   we  cancel  a t   most  m  cycles  and   thus   a  running  time  of  O ( nm )  for  one 
iteration  of  the   Cancel  and   Tighten  Algorithm.  Therefore  the   overall  running  time  of  Cancel  and  
Tighten  is  O ( n 2m  log (nC ) )   (i.e.  an   amortized  time  of  O ( n )   per  cycle  canceled).  We  can  further 
improve  this  by  using  dynamic  trees  t o  get  a n   amortized  time  of  O(1ogn)  per  cycle  canceled  and  
this  results  in  a n  O ( nm  log n log (nC ) )  algorithm. 

4  A  Strongly Polynomial Bound 

In this section, we  give another analysis of  the  algorithm.  This analysis has th e  advantage of  showing 
t h a t   the  number  of  iterations is strongly polynomial,  i.e.  t h a t   i t   is polynomial  in n  and  m  and  does 

not  depend on C.  The  first  strongly polynomial  algorithm for the  minimum  cost circulation problem 
is  due t o  Tardos. 

Definition 3  An  arc  (u, w)  E E  is  €-fixed 

if  f (u, w)  is  the  same fo r   all 6-optimal  circulations. 

There exists a  simple criterion  for  deciding whether  a n  a rc  is  €-fixed. 

Theorem 7  Let  E.  > 0.  Let f  be  a  circulation  and  p  be  node potentials  such  that f  is e-optimal  with 
respect  to p.  If  Icp(v7W )  I  > 2 n ~then  (u, w )  is  €-fixed. 
Proof:  The   proof  is  by  contradiction.  Let  f '  be  an   €-optimal  circulation  for  which  f '(u, w)  # 
f (u, w).  Assume t h a t   Icp(u7w)I  2 2 n e .   Without  loss of  generality, we  can  assume by  antisymmetry 
t h a t  cp(u,w)  < -2ne.  Hence (u, w)  @  E f ,i.e. f (u,w)  = u (u ,  w).  This implies t h a t  f l ( u ,w)  < f (u,w ) .  
Let  E <  = { ( x ,Y )E E :  f l ( ~ , Y )< f ( x , y ) l -

Claim 8  There  exists  a  cycle  I?  in  (V, E < )  that  contains  (u, w) . 

Proof:  Since  (u, w)  E E < ,  i t   is  sufficient  t o  prove  the   existence  of  a  directed  p a th  from w  t o  u  in 
(V,E < ) .  Let  S & V be t h e  nodes reachable from w in  (V,E < ) .  Assume u 4 S. By  flow conservation, 
we  have 

However,  f (u,w) - f ' (u ,  w)  > 0,  i.e.  f (w, u) - f ' (w ,  u)  < 0,  and   by  assumption  w  E S and   u  4 S. 
Therefore,  there  must  exists  x  E  S and   y $! S such  t h a t   f ( x , y)  - f ' (x ,  y)  >  0,  implying  t h a t  
( x , y)  E E < .   This contradicts the   fact  t h a t   y  S .  
By definition of E < , we  have t h a t  E <  C Eft . Hence, th e  mean cost of  r is a t  least  y (f ') = - E (   f ')  = 
--E.On  t h e  other  hand,  the  mean  cost  of  I? is  (1 = II'l): 

a  contradiction. 

Theorem 9  The  Goldberg-Tarjan algorithm  terminates  after O (m 2 nlogn )   iterations. 

Proof:  If  an  a rc  becomes fixed during t h e  execution of  the  algorithm, then  i t  will remain fixed since 
c ( f )  does  not  increase.  We  claim  t h a t ,  as long  as t h e  algorithm  has not  terminated,  one additional 
a rc  becomes  fixed  after  O (mn1ogn )  iterations.  Let  f  be  th e   current  circulation  and   let  r be  the  
first  cycle canceled.  After  m n  log(2n)  iterations, we  obtain  a  circulation  f '  with 

by  Theorem  6 .   Let  p'  be  potentials  for  which  f '  satisfies  the   e ( f t ) -op t ima l i ty  constraints.  By 
definition  of  r ,  

Hence, 

Therefore, the re  exists  (v, w)  E r such t h a t   151(v, w) 1  > -2nc(  f I ) .
  By  th e  previous  Theorem,  (v,w) 
is  c(f ')-fixed.  Moreover,  (v, w)  is  not  c(f )  -fixed  since  canceling  I?  increased  the   flow  on  (v, w). 
This  proves  t h a t ,   after  mn log (2n )   iterations,  one  additional  a rc   becomes  fixed  and   therefore  th e  
algorithm  terminates  in m 2n log(2n) iterations. 

Using  th e  O (m n )  algorithm  for  the  minimum  mean  cost  cycle  problem,  we  obtain  a  O (m3n2logn )  
algorithm  for  th e  minimum  cost  circulation  problem.  Using  th e   Cancel  and   Tighten  improvement 
we  ob ta in   a  running  time  of  O (m 2 n 2log n ) .   And  if  we  implement  Cancel  and   Tighten  with  the  
dynamic trees d a t a  s t ruc tu re  we  get  a  running  time of  0 (m 2 n l o g 2 n ) .  

The  best  known  strongly  polynomial  algorithm  for  th e  minimum  cost  circulation problem  is  due  t o  
Orlin  and  runs  in  O (m  log n ( m  + n log n ) )  = O (m 2log n + m n  log2n )  time.
