Kenneth  Waltz’s  theory  of  international  relations  focuses  on  third  level  (image) 

analysis and posits states as unitary actors  that are  functionally  similar. The purpose of  system 

level  analysis  is  to  explain  “the  results  produced  by  the  uncoordinated  actions  of  states”  as  a 

phenomenon  separate  from  foreign  policy  formulation  (1979,  122).  This  third  level  analysis 

concerns  itself with  the  system of  the  international  sphere. What  follows  is  the  construction of 

a  theory  that  seeks  to explain  the actions of  the actors which comprise  the  system with  respect 

to  structural  conditions.  Waltz’s  theory  of  international  politics  is  distinct  from  a  theory  of 

foreign  policy  specifically  because  the  latter  explains  motives  and  desires  while  the  former 

takes certain motives as fixed, thus they are assumed.  

While  Waltz’s  theory  relies  on  a  third  image  approach,  it  has  been  termed  neo-realist 

for  the  following  reasons:  anarchy  provides  an  environment  of  existential  insecurity;  the 

condition  of  anarchy  prompts  states  to  be  self-preserving  at  minimum,  and  seekers  of  power 

and  relative  gains  at  maximum.  What  distinguishes  Waltz’s  theory  from  classical  realism 

primarily  is  the  use  of  the  concept  of  anarchy  as  an  ordering  principle.  He  characterizes 

anarchy  simply  as  a  condition  in  which  the  units  are  equal  with  “none  entitled  to  command; 

none  is  required  to  obey”  (ibid.,  88).  Since  there  is  no  one  force  with  legitimate  coercive 

power,  states  are  in  a  relation  of  coordination  rather  than  super-  and  subordination.  Based  on 

the  mechanics  of  microeconomic  theory  where  the  presumption  is  that  the  relevant  actors  are 

self-interested,  with  the  resultant  acts  producing  an  order  spontaneously,  the  theory  should 

explain what the major concerns of states are, how and under what circumstances states pursuit 

certain ends, and what the conditions for optimal stability are. A theory of foreign policy on the 

other  hand  is  inherently  a  second  image  approach,  and  as  such  attempts  to  explain  the 

following:  the  mechanics  of  decision  making  for  an  actor;  motivations  particular  to  decision 

makers  within  the  state;  how  a  state  perceives  the  international  environment,  and  how  this 

affects a decision making body. 

Following Waltz’s  reasoning,  a  theory  of  international  politics  could  never  be  founded 

on  a  theory  of  foreign  policy  because  the  construction  of  a  theory  must  make  certain 

assumptions  in  order  to  gain  explanatory  power  for  the  phenomenon  of  concern.  “In  a 

microtheory…the  motivation  of  actors  is  assumed  rather  than  realistically  described,”  and  a 

theory  of  foreign  policy  among  other  things,  seeks  to  provide  an  explanation  of  state 

motivation,  and  this  is  always  particular  to  the  character  and  temperament  of  particular 

individuals during  a  particular  time  (ibid., 91). So one  reason  for  the  incompatability  seems  to 

be  that a  theory of foreign policy  is sensitve  to temporality. The second reason  is  that all states 

are equal and functionally similar given  the relationship of coordination under  the condition of 

anarchy  which  is  tantamount  to  a  constant  Hobbesian  state  of  war,  prompting  states  to  make 

survival  their  paramount  concern.  If  the  ordering  principle  of  anarchy  has  as  its  effect 

motivating  all  actors  toward  the  same  end,  then  a  theory  of  foreign  policy  could  in  no  way 

augment  the  explanatory  power  of  a  theory  of  international  politics.  Besides  the  redundancy, 

foreign  policy  is  concerned  with  more  than  survival,  but  also  with  peripheral  issues  such  as 

trade  agreements  and  environmental  pacts,  and  these  do  not  always  speak  immediately  to  the 

concern of survival in the international system. 

All  theories  that  claim  to  be  systematic with  both  explanatory  power  and  the  ability  to 

support  predictive models  require  identifiable  independent  variables. Two  variables  bear most 

of  the  weight  in  Waltz’s  theory  -  distribution  of  capabilities  and  number  of  great  or  major 

powers;  both  of  these  can  be  subsumed  under  the  rubric  of  balance-of-power  theory. 

Distribution of capabilities is itself a straightforward concept - at any given point in time, there 

is  a  finite  amount  of  power  and  power  producing  potential  in  the  system,  and  these  are  spread 

over  any  given  number  of  actors.  Distribution  of  capabilities  proves  most  useful  to Waltz  for 

two  reasons. First,  it  is germane  to his preoccupation with state survival. In a self-help system, 

only  those states with means can pursue ends, and, controlling  for egos and personalities, ends 

necessarily  are  to  be  brought  in  line with  available means  or  capabilities. Also,  understanding 

how  capabilities  are  distributed  gives  us  an  abstract  of  which  states  are more  likely  to  pursue 

ends  autonomously.  Maybe  most  importantly,  it  gives  us  the  opportunity  to  make  certain 

statements based on agent cognition given  that  the  theory assigns states  the concern of  relative 

gains compared to absolute gains.  

The  variable,  number  of  great  powers,  allows  us  to  observe  what  percentage  of 

capabilities  are  in  how  many  states’  hands.  (It  is  important  to  note  that  on  Waltz’s  account, 

what  power  is  in who’s hands  is of  little  to no  significance.) With  this  information, we  should 

be able  to put  the  theory’s assumptions  to work and make acceptable predictions about  system 

stability.  In  brief,  Waltz  draws  the  conclusion  that  a  system  of  two  powers  is  most  stable, 

because,  among  other  maybe  less  important  reasons,  two  powers  are  better  able  to  observe 

each other’s actions, play effective managerial roles, and are never hostage to an allies decision 

as seemed  to have been  the case in  the ‘timetable crisis’ of World War I. In an alliance or bloc 

comprised  of  more  than  one  significant  power,  fates  become  linked  and  the  ability  to  make 

choices  based  solely  on  the  assessment  of  capabilities  declines  significantly.  Under  these 

conditions stability is at risk simply due more to the number of powers involved rather than the 

postures of the powers. 

Taken  as  a  whole,  Waltz’s  theory  rightly  stresses  the  main  issues  in  international 

politics and their causes: security and anarchy. The framework he constructs to understand how 

states  act  due  to  the  organization  of  the  system  and  distribution  of  capabilities  allows  us  to 

make  reasonable estimates at  the system  level. While he himself concedes certain  factors must 

necessarily  be  omitted  in  the  construction  of  the  theory,  one  is  left  to  wonder  whether 

omissions  such as how, when and why  states utilize  institutions  leave  the  theory unnecessarily 

impoverished.
