PAPER 4: ALLISON & ZELIKOW 

In the second edition of Essence of Decision, Graham Allison and Philip Zelikow 

argue that any account of the Cuban missile crisis must explain three events: 1) Soviet 

deployment of offensive missiles in Cuba; 2) imposition of a U.S. blockade of Cuba; and 

3) withdrawal of Soviet missiles from Cuba (201). Organizational theory sheds light on 

all three of these events, but it is most powerful in explaining the first.    

Organizational imperatives certainly influenced the American imposition of the 

naval blockade. As Allison and Zelikow point out, enforcing the blockade was no small 

undertaking—it required controlling traffic on nearly a million square miles of water, 

coordinating the actions of nearly 200 ships, and handling potentially dangerous 

confrontations with dozens of Russian vessels. The blockade was possible not simply 

because Kennedy ordered it, but because the Navy had previously established a 

meticulous set of plans and routines for executing such a strategy (231, 236). It was 

organizational behavior that made the strategy work, that made it possible to coordinate 

precisely “the behavior of hundreds of individuals” (170). At the same time, however, 

some of the Navy’s organizational practices conflicted with the goals of the president. 

American ships lapsed into radio silence “as part of their defensive routine,” even though 

this decision severed communication with an anxious Situation Room (234). American 

ships experimented with new and potentially risky methods of forcing Soviet nuclear 

submarines to surface, even though the president worried these tactics could escalate to 

nuclear war (234). Admiral Anderson disregarded Secretary MacNamara’s reservations 

1

and insisted on tracking a Soviet submarine several hundred miles from the quarantine 

line, because “it was just part of the overall naval strategy and … in such situations it was 

a common Navy practice to ‘trail’ unidentified submarines” (236). In each of these cases, 

the Navy’s—or “America’s”—behavior was either inconsistent with the country’s stated 

goals or actually increased the possibility that the crisis would escalate. Yet, there was 

little that the top-level political leadership could do to change the behavior of the very 

organization whose routines and procedures were also needed to make the strategy 

succeed. 

Organizational theory also illuminates some aspects of the Soviet withdrawal of 

missiles from Cuba, although much of Allison and Zelikow’s interesting analysis under 

this heading is not actually about the resolution of the crisis. It is true, though, that 

Khrushchev’s frustration with the cumbersome processes of formal interstate 

communication led him to make his famous second offer on the radio, instead of in 

private (239-240). What American leaders saw as a bad faith gesture designed to 

complicate their negotiating position was instead a Soviet leader’s attempt to overcome 

the organizational routines of his own bureaucracy. Kennedy experienced some similar 

frustrations with the State Department, which did not respond promptly to his directive to 

“undertake private discussion with the Turks that would prepare the way to respond 

effectively to Khrushchev’s predictable maneuver” (241). Following the organizational 

tendency to “interpret mandates in their own terms,” the State Department read 

Kennedy’s order as an opportunity to advance its own negotiating agenda with Turkey. It 

also failed to register the urgency of the situation, leading to the inexplicably 

2 

“formalized, sluggish,” and “inappropriate” behavior that Allison and Zelikow argue 

organizations tend to produce (170). 

Organizational theory sheds the most light on Soviet actions in Cuba. One can 

certainly interpret the emplacement of missiles there as Krushchev’s attempt to force a 

showdown over Berlin (203). And yet, many Soviet decisions in the summer and fall of 

1962 did not seem to further this goal, and in some cases even made it more difficult to 

achieve. For example, the USSR seemed not to anticipate the possibility of U2 

observance of its actions in Cuba, even though the USSR was well aware of U2 

photographic capability and its use for surveillance of nuclear sites in the USSR (206). 

The USSR did not shoot down the initial U2 flight on October 14, even though it had 

functioning surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) installed in Cuba at the time (207). The USSR 

made no attempt to camouflage its activities until the United States publicly disclosed its 

knowledge of the Soviet buildup in Cuba (207-8). The “sites constructed in Cuba were 

built to look exactly like the SAM, MRBM, and IRBM sites in the Soviet Union,” which 

enabled American analysts to identify them easily (208). Most important, the strategic 

character of the nuclear missiles placed in Cuba was nonsensical. The sites were 

extremely soft, that is, vulnerable to a first strike, and the Soviets “transported an extra 

ballistic missile for each pair of launchers,” so that a launcher could be reloaded and a 

second “nuclear salvo” could be fired from each missile site (209). Yet the Cuban 

missiles could hope to fire twice only if the United States was caught by complete 

surprise and had never discovered the sites—in which case, how could the sites have 

been used as a bargaining chip over Berlin? Under all reasonable scenarios, a third of the 

missiles the Soviets had painstakingly transported to Cuba would never be fired (209). 

3 

These seemingly bizarre decisions make sense only when evaluated as the 

products of Soviet organizations transporting their methods 8,000 miles to a foreign 

island. For example, it was the lack of a standard operating procedure for creating 

camouflage that led the workers in Cuba to avoid it in favor of what they considered their 

“critical task”—constructing the missiles (168- 169). According to Allison and Zelikow, 

“a serious effort to camouflage the operation was possible” if the workers had been 

willing to adapt to the conditions of the island. “But the units constructing the missiles 

had no routine for camouflage, having never camouflaged construction in the Soviet 

Union” (213). So they chose not to. Similarly, as a Soviet general explained, the SAM 

operators did not fire on the U2 because “Moscow had sent them to Cuba to defend 

against air attack, not aerial espionage” (214). Again, the organization chose not to 

deviate from the “objectives most congruent to [its] special capacities” (167, 177), and in 

fact did not even turn on its radars to track spy planes (214). Meanwhile, the easily 

identifiable pattern of missile construction and the puzzling strategic character of the 

weapons placed in Cuba reflected the Strategic Rocket Forces’ reliance on its own 

programs and repertoires (170). “At the sites, each team did what it knew how to do… At 

each IRBM site, the two pairs of identical launchers were separated by 750 feet,” because 

that was the distance between IRBM sites in the Soviet Union. “An extra missile was 

transported for each pair of launchers because … refire capability… was part of their 

usual deployment in the western Soviet Union, aimed at Western Europe.” The missile 

sites were left vulnerable, “not because of any intention to launch a first strike, but rather 

because no Soviet missile sites had ever been hardened” (212). Over and over, Soviet 

actions in Cuba that seemed anomalous or outright inconsistent with “rational” Soviet 

4 

interests appear predictable and logical in light of organization theory. The organizations 

were operating according to a “logic of appropriateness”—“a matching of rules to 

situations”—rather than a “logic of consequences,” which would require choosing actions 

by “evaluating their probable consequences for the preferences of the actor” and 

engaging in a “selective, heuristic search among alternatives” to devise a solution (146).
