In his aptly titled Theory of International Politics (1978), Kenneth Waltz presents 

what he calls a systems theory of international politics—an explanation of how the 

structure of the international order affects the behavior of states. Waltz sharply 

distinguishes this account from what he calls unit-level theories, or descriptions of states’ 

foreign policies. Although these two types of theories often blur together in the  

international relations literature, the distinction between the two is crucial not only to 

understanding Waltz’s argument on its own terms, but also to criticizing the argument 

properly and to defending it. 

For Waltz, the perpetual condition of anarchy makes the international order very 

different from hierarchic national orders. Because states cannot appeal to any higher 

authority to resolve their disputes, understanding international politics writ large means 

we have “to conceive of an order without an orderer and of organizational effects where 

formal organization is lacking” (89). Taking a page from microeconomic theory, Waltz 

compares international politics to a market: 

The  market  arises  out  of  the  activities  of  separate  units—persons  and 
firms—whose  aims  and  efforts  are  directed  not  toward  creating  order 
but  rather  toward  fulfilling  their  own  internally  defined  interests  by 
whatever  means  they  can  muster.  The  individual  unit  acts  for  itself. 
From  the  coaction  of  like  units  emerges  a  structure  that  affects  and 
constrains all of them. Once formed, a market becomes a force in itself, 
and a force  that  the constitutive units acting singly or  in small numbers 
cannot control (90).  

As this analogy helps clarify, the structure of the international system arises from the 

actions of individual units, which seek to survive and which have to help themselves in a 

world of anarchy (91). Their interaction creates a certain structure that then “conditions 

1

their calculations, their behaviors, and their interactions” in such a way that successful 

patterns of state behavior are “selected,” or imitated, and others are punished—just as 

some firms make a profit in the market and some go bankrupt (91). For Waltz, as for 

Adam Smith, the question of intentionality—or lack thereof—is paramount. States do not 

intend to create the structure of international politics, just as firms do not intend to create 

a market (108, 120). Merely by seeking survival and pursuing their own interests, the 

structure emerges. 

Certain patterns of behavior also emerge, not because states consciously follow 

rules of action but because the structure of the international system perpetually constrains 

and socializes states in certain ways. Waltz argues that over time a balance of power 

tends to recur among states, even if it is not the same states that are always powerful and 

even if the balance is achieved through different types of state actions (118). 

Fundamentally, “states are alike in the tasks that they face, though not in their abilities to 

perform them. The differences are of capability, not of function” (96). For Waltz the 

main question in international politics is therefore how the distribution of capabilities 

among states varies— how the international system is more or less stable, more or less 

peaceful, depending on the number of great powers. Other questions about states—about 

regime type, about history, about internal problems—are not relevant (99). Waltz argues, 

in fact, that “in all of modern history the structure of international politics has changed 

but once,” when World War II brought the collapse of multipolarity and ushered in the 

bipolarity of the Cold War (163).1 For this reason, a theory of international politics need

as a third change in the structure of international politics.

only “abstract from every attribute of states except their capabilities” in order to make 

predictions about the nature of the international system (99).  

In calling for a focus on states’ capabilities, however, Waltz takes pains to 

emphasize that he is still ultimately concerned with changes in the system-wide 

distribution of capabilities, rather than with specific changes in the capabilities of 

individual units (98). To return to the microeconomic analogy, he is still concerned with 

whether the market is a duopoly or oligopoly, not with whether a particular firm made 

good profits this year or with whether one firm displaced another as the market leader. 

This is a crucial distinction, for otherwise Waltz’s theory would fall into the trap of 

arbitrarily analyzing some unit-level features of the international system and ignoring 

others—and Waltz clearly wants to distinguish his theory from one focused on unit-level 

factors. Hinting at the arguments of some of his critics and at the approaches of other 

scholars, Waltz urges the reader not “to mistake a theory of international politics for a 

theory of foreign policy” (121). “Any theory covers some matters and leaves others 

aside,” he writes. Balance-of-power theory “makes assumptions about the interests and 

motives of states, rather than explaining them. What it does explain are the constraints 

that confine all states,” which can generate broad predictions about how states will 

behave when confronted with similar situations (122). Waltz freely admits that balance-

of-power theory “does not tell us why state X made a certain move last Tuesday.” But he 

claims that expecting it to do so “would be like expecting the theory of universal 

gravitation to explain the wayward path of a falling leaf” (121). It is simply not within the 

scope of the theory, and trying to account for it violates one of the very assumptions (the 

3 

lack of functional differentiation among states) that gives the theory its explanatory 

power. 

All this not to say that Waltz is somehow against the study of foreign policy. To 

the contrary, he clearly recognizes the importance of unit-level analysis in refining 

predictions about particular cases. For instance, states react differently to the same 

structural constraints, just as different firms make different decisions about how to 

compete in the market. “To explain the differences in national responses,” Waltz 

concedes, “a theory would have to have to show how the different internal structures of 

states affect their external policies and actions” (122). This would be “a theory of foreign 

policy” examining the intentions and conscious goals of states, and “would lead to 

different expectations about the tendencies and styles of different countries’ policies”— 

rather than to general predictions about the constraints the system places on all actors, 

irrelevant of their motives (123). Moreover, “because the national and international levels 

are linked, theories of both types, if they are any good, tell us some things, but not the 

same things, about behavior and outcomes at both levels” (123, italics added). Waltz is 

concerned with elaborating a theory of how factors at the international level explain state 

behavior, and in particular with understanding whether “destabilizing events and 

conditions …are likely to be managed better, and… absorbed more readily, in one system 

than in another (167). Such a focus is not the same thing as expounding structural 

determinism (174); it is merely an attempt at theoretical clarity in a field littered with 

sloppy and at times inconsistent assumptions. 

Although it is impossible to review the voluminous secondary literature on Waltz 

in a paper of this length, an understanding of his theory of international politics—and 

4 

why it is not a theory of foreign policy—provides a foundation upon which any defense, 

criticism, or other engagement of his theory must rest.
