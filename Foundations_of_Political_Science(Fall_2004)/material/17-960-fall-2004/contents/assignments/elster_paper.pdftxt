Jon Elster - The Cement of Society 

Jon Elster’s main concern in The Cement of Society is to understand “what is it that glues 

societies  together  and  prevents  them  from  disintegrating”  into  substantial  disorder  (1995,  1). 

While  he  believes  rational  choice  theory  provides  important  insights  into  this  problem,  a 

substantial  thesis  is  “social  norms  provide  an  important  kind  of  motivation  for  action  that  is 

irreducible to rationality or indeed to any other form of optimizing mechanism” (ibid. 16). In this 

paper  I  first  provide  accounts  of  the  following  concepts  key  to  Elster’s  approach:  collective 

action,  social  norms,  the  norm  of  fairness,  and  everyday  Kantianism.  Second,  I  engage  Elster’s 

assertion that the interaction of everyday Kantianism with the norm of fairness provides a greater 

amount of cooperation than possible as stand alone motivations to collective action. 

Collective  action  results  from  the  cooperation  of  multiple  agents  and  “is  defined  by  the 

feature  that  contributions  have  diffuse  benefits  and  precise  costs”  (191).  On  this  view,  a  main 

problem  of  collective  action  is  the  following:  if  A’s  participation  is  calculated  to  cost  X,  with  a 

result R  that  has  benefit Y  not  easily  calculable  by A,  then A may  not  be  rationally motivated  to 

cooperate.  Elster  invokes  the  theory  of  social  norms  to  provide  a  way  of  understanding  why 

cooperation  occurs  in  those  instances  rational  choice  theory  fails  to  understand  an  agent’s 

motivation. 

Elster’s idea of social norms distinguishes social actors from the individuals that populate 

classical  economics.  He  contends  that  behavior  influenced  by  social  norms  is  “‘pushed’  from 

behind by quasi-internal forces.” Moreover, agents acting on  this family of norms are  indifferent 

to  circumstances  even  if better ones make  themselves  available. The  last  component  to  this  idea 

is  that  social  norms  coordinate  expectation  but  do  not  guarantee  the  cooperation  of  agents  (97). 

The  force  behind  social  norms  is  that  “they  must  be  shared  by  other  people  and  [are]  partly 

sustained  by  their  approval  or  disapproval”  (99).  Because  our  adherence  to  these  norms  are  in 

part  sustained  by  feelings  of  guilt  or  embarrassment, Elster  claims  that  they  “have  a  grip  on  the 

mind”  (100  [emphasis  in  original]). With  respect  to  the  problem  of  collective  action  he  believes 

that  since  “contributions  are  easily  identifiable…they  can  become  the  object  of  a  social  norm  to 

cooperate” (191-192). 

The norm of  fairness “tells an  individual  to cooperate  if and only  if everybody else, or at 

least a substantial number of others, cooperate” (187). Individuals operating by  these parameters 

will  have  different  thresholds  of  cooperation  as  each  person will  have  their  own  idea  as  to what 

constitutes  ‘substantial’.  The  various  thresholds  of  cooperation  indicate  a  sensitivity  to  costs;  it 

also  impels  us  to  follow  the majority.  Because  this  norm  is  predicated  on  the  number  of  people 

actually  participating,  agents  are  motivated  “to  defect  when  there  are  few  cooperators,  even  if 

[they] are on an increasing stretch of the average-benefit curve” - the inverse is also true (189). 

Everyday Kantianism states: “one should cooperate if and only if universal cooperation is 

better for everybody than universal defection” (192). The everyday Kantian first identifies where 

her  duty  lies  -  the  categorical  imperative  is  likely  invoked.  As  an  everyday  Kantian  she  is 

sensitive  to  benefits  (outcomes),  but  in  reality  she  calculates  next  whether  the  costs  are 

prohibitive. Elster asserts that the Kantian is somewhat sensitive to the benefits, but it seems that 

this consideration is based not necessarily on benefits that would accrue to her, but she is instead 

preoccupied with the question “What if everyone did that?” (193). The categorical imperative, as 

a  moral  doctrine  initially,  then,  seems  to  motivate  a  consequentialist  perspective,  but  strictly 

within  the  realm  of  conceiving  of  oneself  as  a  co-actor  whose  actions  when  universalized  have 

(possibly serious) implications for all involved. 

Since  the  results  of  collective  action  are  diffuse  benefits  with  precise  costs,  a 

comprehensive  account  of  substantial  cooperation  needs  to  consider  mixed  motives  to 

accommodate  these  conditions.  On  Elster’s  view,  the  interaction  of  everyday  Kantianism  with 

the  norm  of  fairness  gets  us  to  this  goal.  In  figure  5.1  -  representing  the  relationship  between 

average  utility  and  number  of  actors  - we  are  asked  to  consider  a  situation  in which  the  average 

utility of an action collectively taken first declines slightly (actually resulting in negative utility), 

and  then  recrosses  the  zero-sum  threshold,  peaks  after  a more  or  less  gentle  positive  slope,  and 

then gradually declines. Here we see the impact of their interaction. 

Elster  states  that  everyday Kantianism  embraces  a  form of magical  thinking  -  “the belief 

that by acting on  the  symptoms one can also change  the cause”  (196).  In  the scenario above,  the 

negative  utility  at  a  certain  point  in  the  function  invites Kantians  (with  elite  participationists)  to 

take  collective  action  since  they  are  concerned  about  the  benefits  that  accrue  to  all  (diffuse 

benefits). Because  they ask  themselves “what would happen  if everyone acted  in a certain way”, 

and  negative  utility  for  the  broader  population  is  supposedly  something  to  be  corrected  for,  if 

possible,  they  are  among  the  first  to  try  and  reverse  the  negative  trend  (192  [emphasis  in 

original]).  This  is  supported  by  their magical  thinking  since  this  influences  them  to  believe  that 

to have others act as they do, they should do so first, thus changing the cause.  

At  some  point,  as  the  number  of  participants  and  utility  increases  (though  not  yet  at  its 

peak),  those  subscribing  to  the  norms  of  fairness  begin  to  take  part  in  the  given  action.  This  is 

because  they  witness  a  good  deal  of  people  actually  cooperating  (after  the  addition  of  the 

utilitarian  and mass  participationists, who  are  themselves, we  are  to  understand,  actuated  by  the 

early  action  of  the  everyday  Kantians).  Their  norm,  which  stipulates  action  under  these 

circumstances (it should be noted, regardless of the cause) is also cost sensitive, further signaling 

their  opportunity  given  the  reduced  costs  given  the  number  of  cooperating  participants.  The 

gradual addition of  those acting on  the norm of  fairness, even with  the elite participationists and 

most everyday Kantians dropping out, gets us to or close to the maximum utility.  

Everyday  Kantianism  alone  is  insufficient  to  produce  substantial  cooperation  upon  the 

realization  that  at  some  point  a  large  number  of  cooperators  would  adversely  affect  utility.  Not 

wanting  everyone  else  to  act  in  this  manner  (magical  thinking  +  ‘universalizability’)  those 

employing  this  norm  would  likely  cease  cooperating  before  the  peak  of  the  utility  curve  was 

reached.  The  norm  of  fairness  is  insufficient  to  get  us  to  significant  levels  of  cooperation  since 

initially there are few cooperators and the norm tells us to defect under these conditions. Elster’s 

consideration of mixed motives is especially important here since “cooperation could never arise 

in  a  population  in  which  everybody  was  motivated  by  the  norm  of  fairness”  (187). While  both 

social  norms  are  requisite  for  reconciling 

the 

tensions  between  cost-sensitivity  and 

consequentialism  in  situations  calling  for  collective  action,  the  heavy  work  is  done  not  only  by 

the  idea  of  mixed  motives,  but  also  presumably  by  the  proper  mix  of  motives  since  we  can 

imagine  a  society  maybe  sufficiently  populated  by  everyday  Kantians  but  under  populated  by 

those motivated by the norm of fairness.
