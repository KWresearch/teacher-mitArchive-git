Notes on Waltz 

Waltz’s book belongs to an important style of theorizing, in which far-reaching 

conclusions about a domain—in this case, the domain of international 

politics—are derived from a very spare set of premises. The classic example of 

this style of political theory is Hobbes’s Leviathan. 

There, Hobbes claims that a minimal and plausible set of premises about 

human nature implies a large conclusion about political society. In particular, he 

makes two claims: first, he argues that if people are concerned with their own 

preservation and future well-being; uncertain about the motives of others; 

relatively equal in natural capacities; interdependent, in the sense that their 

preservation and happiness depend on the conduct of others; concerned about 

their own sense of self-worth; and prone to various passions (including fear, 

pride, envy, and jealousy) that can lead them to act against their own long-term 

interests, then it follows: first, that in anarchic conditions (with no authority), there 

would be a state of war, in which everyone is prepared to fight (and knows that 

others are too), and as a result life would be nasty, poor, brutish, and short, and 

our interests in preservation and future well-being would not be advanced; and 

second, that the only stable solution to the problem of anarchy and conflict is 

common submission to the will and judgment of an absolute political authority. 

Moreover, second, he argues that the various conditions in the antecedent of the 

conditional I just stated are truths about human nature: not truths that about what 

human beings are like in some circumstances, but simply about what human 

beings as such are like. 

Now, there are certain important substantive analogies between Waltz’s view 

and Hobbes’s, but I am not here interested in those points of substantive overlap. 

I am interested instead in the fact that both draw sweeping conclusions from an 

apparently spare set of assumptions—in Hobbes’s cases, assumptions about 

people; in Waltz’s case, assumptions about the position of states—and that they 

take those assumptions to be very broadly true. Correspondingly, in evaluating 

their arguments we need to ask two questions: (1) do their conclusions follow 

from the premises? So, in the case of Hobbes we want to know whether the 

assumptions about people, once they are reasonably precisely stated, really do 

imply that the state of nature would be a state of war, and that the only stable 

alternative is political absolutism. At least one strand of Lockean criticism of 

Hobbes says that you can, arguing from basically Hobbesian premises, defend a 

more limited, constitutional government; (2) second, if the conclusions do follow 

from the premises, then we want to know whether the premises really have such 

broadly applicability. So one strand of Rousseauean criticism of Hobbes says 

that, while it may be true that political absolutism is required to preserve a stable 

peace among Hobbesian agents, nevertheless, Hobbes has not described 

human beings as they are by nature, but rather as they have become—as their 

many possibilities have been expressed—under one possible set of social 

conditions. 

The two lines of criticism are different: the first suggests that the premises 

themselves are less constraining of political possibilities than the argument 

supposes; the second allows that the premises may be very constraining, but 

then argues that the premises themselves are more historically specific than they 

are presented as being, and need not be taken as fixed. But the two lines of 

criticism converge in suggesting that the range of social and political possibilities 

is wider than the theory tells us. That is an important result. So in exploring 

Waltz’s theory, we want to know three things: (1) what are the central claims he 

defends about the conduct of international politics; (2) what are his premises 

about states and their relations; and (3) do his premises lead to his conclusions? 

The reason for pursuing the exercise is not to quibble about logical gaps, but to 

see whether the space of possibility is greater than Waltz’s argument might 

suggest. 

1.	 What are some of the implications that Waltz draws from his 
structural/systems theory of international politics? Central claims about 
how states conduct their business in relation to one another. 

•	

International politics is a self-help system (principle of action), unlike 
domestic politics. This appears to have both an organizational and a 
motivational interpretation: (i) organizationally, agents (states) must be 
prepared to defend themselves, whereas in domestic system an 
organization provides protection against private force; (ii) motivationally, 
states “act for their own sakes” (112); “for their own interests” (113); 
“security is the highest end” (126). More particularly, states typically use 
the methods described by the idea of Realpolitik (117): (a) state’s interest 
provides the spring of action; (b) what states need to do is determined by 
the “unregulated competition of states”; (c) can work out policies that 
serve these needs by calculation; (d) test of success is survival and 
strengthening state. Question we want to ask is: is it true that international 
politics is a self-help system, and if it is a self-help system in the 

organizational sense, then why do states use the methods of Realpolitik? 
What other methods for the conduct of policy might be used? 

•	 The state system tends to a balance of power: (i) as to the balancing part: 
we see balancing rather than bandwagoning (siding with the more 
powerful), or buckpassing that does not lead to balancing (not that there is 
no buckpassing, but that it happens when someone else can be expected 
to pick up the slack); (ii) as to the power part, states balance against 
power or capabilities (correct for imbalances of power), not against 
threats: the distinction is that an assessment of threats requires an 
assessment of intentions. So for example, growth rate in military spending 
will be greater in less powerful state/alliance than in more powerful, 
regardless of any assessment of intentions: worried about what others can 
do to you, not in the first instance about whether they are likely to try; (iii) 
the policies that lead to balance involve alliances with surprising allies 
(France/Russia) and the adoption of surprising practices (large military 
spending by US after WWII) 

•	 States emulate (127-28) each other and are socialized into the norms of 
interstate competition, and the resulting of emulation and socialization is 
greater unity of conduct than of culture, regime, history: (i) they emulate 
military practices and doctrines of competitors, even when those practices 
and doctrines are at odds with their own aspirations and ideologies 
(consider the case of revolutionary regimes); (ii) states with different 
regimes and cultures adopt practices that are more common across states 
than would have been expected, given their differences. 

•	 States often fail to cooperate: (i) these failures hold, even when mutual 
gains are possible through specialization and associated 
interdependence, or by accepting a common set of rules (about the use of 
a resource, or the generation of a benefit), and when the possibility of 
such gains is well-understood; (ii) efforts to break out of these patterns of 
limited cooperation by adopting new policies and new agreements tend to 
break down. 

•	 Bipolar systems behave in fundamentally different ways from multipolar 
systems: (i) in bipolar systems, balancing principally takes the form 
internal efforts to increase the various bases of power (it could also take a 
more imperial or colonial form); in multipolar systems, balancing works 
principally through alliances (and divide-and-rule): this is the defining 
difference between bipolar and multipolar systems (163); (ii) bipolar 
systems are more stable than multipolar systems, where “more stable” 
means more peaceful (second meaning of “stability” has to do with 
enabling cooperation). 

2.	 Structural Theory of these Patterns 

•	 Main explanation of these features is structure of system: (i) structure is 
an arrangement of parts: a system of relations among units (positions); (ii) 
not a characterization of the internal properties of the units themselves, 
whether their regimes, cultures, histories, aims, or capacities (except in 
relation to the capacities of others).. 

•	 Main structural distinction is between anarchy and hierarchy, as “ordering 
principles”: (i) international politics, the units are states; (ii) the basic 
relation between and among states is characterized by anarchy; (iii) in 
anarchy, no agent organized to prevent the private use of force (104), 
whereas in hierarchy there is a monopoly on the legitimate use of power. 

•	 Structural variation, given ordering principle: (i) distribution of capabilities, 
meaning numbers of major powers (or poles); (ii) the fundamental 
distinction, because of differences of alliance methods, is between bipolar 
and multipolar; (iii) power is multidimensional, and it is the cumulative 
effect of many dimensions that is expressed in an ordering according to 
capabilities, which include territory and population, 

•	 Structural explanation (causation): (i) consequences for conduct of 
relations between states follow from assumptions about structure, both 
anarchy itself, and distribution of capabilities; (ii) way that structure 
“causes” effects is either through competition/selection or socialization; (iii) 
not causation of an event by a prior event, or of a result as intended by an 
agent, but explanation of a pattern or regularity by reference to the 
constraints under which agents act. 

3. Connections Between Structural Theory and Implications

•	 What explains the use of Realpolitik methods? (i) one answer is that the 
characteristic aims of states are assumed or postulated: namely, that 
states pursue their interests, and that security is the highest interest. They 
are assumed, and then we see what results from the assumption. But 
Waltz says something different (117): that they are a product of structural 
constraints, in particular the constraints imposed by anarchy; (ii) so a 
second answer, of this structural kind, is that it is a matter of selection, on 
the model of natural selection, where the explanation of the pervasive 
presence of a trait in a population is explained by the reproductive 
success of organisms with the trait, and the failure of organisms that lack 
it: they “fall by the wayside” (77). So here the idea would be that, given the 
condition of anarchy, states that do not use Realpolitik methods go out of 
existence, like firms that go bankrupt (77). This argument gives substance 
to the idea of a structural constraint—of a structural cause that accounts 

for a result by operating as a constraint that reduces variation—but the 
trouble with applying it here is that states VERY rarely go out of existence; 
(iii) sometimes, it is said that states emulate other successful states, as
part of a process of socialization: “if some states do relatively well, others 
will emulate them or fall by the wayside” (118). But it is not clear why we 
should expect emulation—of a kind that works to substantially reduce 
variation and lead all to Realpolitik methods— unless the emulation is 
necessary to survival, or we make some more substantial motivational 
assumptions about what drives political decision makers; (iv) important 
that Waltz wants to account for the use of these methods structurally, 
without depending on assumptions about the rationality or the psychology 
of decision makers: without relying on properties of the units, rather than 
the relations between units. 

•	 Why does anarchy lead to balancing of power? (i) the idea is that if states 
use Realpolitik methods, then 

•	 Why is bipolar system especially stable: (I) in a bipolar system there is 
very little interdependence among the great powers, in the sense of 
mutual vulnerability, and very little dependence of the poles on the 
periphery. Intuitive idea then seems to be that, if you are not very 
vulnerable, then you can be indifferent to a great deal of what happens: 
“the costs of, and the odds on, losing our trading partners, is very low” 
(159). So the great powers can do what they need to ensure their own 
security; (ii) in a bipolar system, no needs of great powers to make 
decisions through accommodation of other powers, which can produce 
rigidity rather than flexibility; (iii) in a bipolar system, there is a crisper 
sense of responsibility, because the major powers cannot expect 
problems to be addressed by other major powers (minimizes 
buckpassing); (iv) the stability of a bipolar system can be upset by 
changes anywhere in the system 

•	 The limits on interstate cooperation result from anarchical structure, in two 
ways (105-107): (i) because of concerns about the division of the benefits 
of cooperation, which may be damaging or destructive to security because 
the gains translate into power (concern about relative gains may not be so 
prominent in the domestic case, unless there is strong envy or zero-sum 
politics). So it is inconsistent with balancing to cooperate in a project that 
assigns a greater share of benefits to another state; (ii) because of 
concerns about dependence and the resulting vulnerability: “states do not 
willingly place themselves in situations of increased dependence” (107), 
so there are limits on specialization; (iii) because the undesirable results 
that come from failures of cooperation reflect the structure in international 
politics cannot be changed without changing the structure of the system of 
international politics. And changing the structure would impose large 
organizational costs, produce lots of conflict by establishing a large prize 

in the form of a central power, which would need to be very powerful to 
hold the hierarchy together (111-12).
