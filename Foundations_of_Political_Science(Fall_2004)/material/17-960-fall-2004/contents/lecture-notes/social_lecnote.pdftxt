Social Choice 

Josh Cohen 

1. The Voting Paradox

The puzzles in the area of social choice begin with the paradox of voting. So 

suppose we as a group are trying to decide when the course should meet: 9, 10, 

or 11. Suppose that choosing rationally (whether for a group or person) is 

choosing the best alternative from a consistently ordered set of feasible 

alternatives, and that the group ranking is fixed by majority support: A is ranked 

higher than B by the group iff A is ranked higher than B by a majority of group 

members. Assume finally that consistency is a matter of transitivity of “better 

than”: that if A is better than B and B is better than C, then A is better than C (we 

will see later that there are ways to weaken this notion). 

Assume that we divide into three groups of equal size: 

Best 

Second 

Worst 

I 

II 

III 

9 

11 

10 

10 

9 

11

11 

10 

 9 

Lets ask how the group ranks the three possibilities, using majority rule as the 

procedure for group ranking: 9 beats 10, 10 beats 11, and 11 beats 9. Group 

rationality (i.e. transitivity) requires that 9 beat 11. But 11 is a majority rule winner 

over 9. In fact matters are worse: putting aside the failure of transitivity, notice 

that each alternative loses to another alternative. Thus we have not just a failure 

of transitivity, but further a failure of acyclicity, which is an even more minimal 

condition of rational decision: 

Acyclicity: If x1Px2Px3...xn-1Pxn, then not xnPx1 

A violation of acyclicity means that the feasible set contains no best element. If 

rationality means choosing the best from the feasible, then there is no basis here 

for rational choice. 

One might wonder whether there is something very special about this 

case. The answer appears to be: No. Assume we have at least three people and 

a set of alternatives that vary continuously on two dimensions (e.g., guns and 

butter; spending on environmental regulation and economic growth). Two things 

turn out to be true: Using majority rule as the basis of the collective ordering, 

there is virtually never a best element—that is, everything loses to something.1 

And, what is worse, the majority rule cycle is global. That is, beginning from any 

alternative, we can arrive at any other point by finitely many applications of 

majority choice: including points that are worse for everyone that the original 

(outside the pareto set). So if I tell you the preferences of the members of a 

group and that the group will make its decisions by majority rule, this information, 

taken on its own, will not enable you to narrow the class of outcomes at all. The 

product of majority-rule procedures will simply a result that reflects features of 

circumstances (say, the order of decision-making, permissible amendment 

procedures, institutions of decision-making), but will lack any deeper rationale in 

1 Special symmetry conditions are required to prevent this. 

a rational group decision based (via majority rule) on individual judgments, 

values, and tastes. 

2. Social Choice Theory

Faced with these majority rule troubles, one might wonder if there are special 

troubles with rational group decisions using majority rule as a method of 

aggregation. Perhaps there is some alternative to majority rule that enables us to 

base a group or collective ranking of alternatives on rational individual rankings 

of those alternatives, where the collective ranking is itself rational. Thus Arrow 

says (SCIV, 2): “The methods of voting and the market…are methods of 

amalgamating the tastes of many individuals in the making of social choices. The 

methods of dictatorship and convention are, or can be, rational in the sense that 

any individual can be rational in his choices. Can such consistency [rationality] be 

attributed to collective modes of choice, where the wills of many people are 

involved?” 

Social choice theory explores this possibility: of basing rational collective 

choices on rational individual choices. The field of social choice theory provides a 

way to formalize these two fundamental ideas: (1) the idea that a group or 

collective ranking is constructed from rational individual rankings, with the 

members treated as equals; and (2) the idea that the group acts rationally. We 

can then study whether the difficulties in the case of majoritarian conception of 

group preference can be circumvented if we opt for some other account of group 

judgment, while preserving the idea that this judgment must bear some 

systematic connection to the rankings of alternatives by individual members. 

Framework 

I want now to sketch out the main elements of the social choice theory 

framework. In each case, I will make some comments on interpretation that will 

figure in later discussion. 

1. Alternatives. Individuals face a set of alternatives (policies or outcomes) 

that they personally rank and over which we are looking to characterize a group 

ranking. Let the set of alternatives be X={x, y, z,...}. In Arrow, the alternatives 

ordered by individuals are vectors that represent total social states: complete 

specifications of all the goods of each person, the resources devoted to each 

economic activity, the level of government activity, etc.2 

2. Individuals. There is a set of individuals I={1,2,...,n}, each of whom has 

an ordering R  (complete, reflexive, transitive) over X: thus, we read xRiy as: for
i

individual i, x is at least as good as y; xPiy as x is preferred to y; and xIiy as 

individual i is indifferent between x and y. We define R in terms of P and I: xRy 

=df xPy or xIy. 

Completeness: For all x,y in X, either xRiy or yPix.


Reflexivity: for all x in X, xRix


Full Transitivity: for all x,y,z in X, if xPy and yPz, then xPz; if xIy and yIz,


then xIz; (and similarly for PI/P and IP/P) 

2 Arrow, 17. 

An array of such orderings, one for each individual, is called a profile: [R ]. 
i

Because X is finite, the ordering can be represented by an ordinal utility function. 

For every person, there is a function ui from the set X of alternatives to the real 

numbers, such that xPiy iff ui(x)>ui(y). And of course if there is one such function, 

there an infinitely many others. 

3. Social Preference Relation. Let R be the social preference relation: so 

'xPy' is to be read as "x is socially better than/preferred to y;" 'xRy' that "x is 

socially at least as good as y." What “social preference” comes to is not so clear, 

and two interpretations are available. One is that the social ranking represents a 

ranking of alternative social states to be used by officials—or by citizens when 

making public political judgments—in assessing policies that will be made and 

enforced by the state (107). 

Alternatively, the social ranking can be thought of as the product of some 

institution for making decisions (market, elections, committee) in which the inputs 

to the institution are individual preferences or evaluations of alternatives. Here "x 

is socially better than y" comes out as: institutions are so arranged that y is not 

chosen when x and y are both available (analogous to a revealed preference 

idea for individual preferences). 

4. Aggregation Function. A collective choice rule is a function (many-one) 

that assigns a social preference ranking to profiles of individual rankings (may be 

undefined for some rankings, unless it satisfies unrestricted domain): 

Collective Choice Rule: R=f([R ])i

If the function’s range is restricted to full transitive social preference relations, 

then it is called a "social welfare function." If it is confined to acyclic social 

preference relations, it is called a "social decision function." 

To see the difference between social welfare functions and social decision 

functions, consider the following social preference relation that is not transitive: 

xPy, yPz, xIz. While it fails to be transitive (or even quasi-transitive3), it is acyclic 

since z is not preferred to x; only one element is at least as good as every other 

(last man standing). Intuitively, this seems sufficient for arriving at a rational 

decision: for choosing the best from the feasible. 

Corresponding to the two interpretations of the social preference relation, 

there are two interpretations of a collective choice rule. On the one hand, we can 

think of it as a way of determining what the social choice ought to be, given any 

array of individual preferences: that is, as a political principle or basis of political 

advice. So, for example, take Majority Rule as the SWF: then, the collective 

choice ought to be the alternative that is majority-preferred over all alternatives. 

This might be implemented in a variety of ways: for example, a fully informed 

benevolent dictator might pick the majority preferred alternative. On the other 

hand, we might think of majority rule as an institution which picks the majority-

supported alternative as the winner. 

In an interesting paper from the early 1950s, James Buchanan criticizes 

the idea of a social welfare (or social decision) function, on both interpretations. 

The idea of the social welfare function as an aggregation rule is objectionable 

3 Quasi-transitive: strict preference is transitive, but indifference is not. 

because the very idea of a social preference or collective judgment requires that 

we think of society as an entity with “an existence apart from that of its individual 

components” (116). You might alternatively (see Arrow’s discussion of ideas of 

consensus) think that the idea of a collective judgment makes sense, but reject 

the idea of constructing it from individual orderings, rather than from expressions 

of opinions of what is socially best. On the institutional interpretation: Buchanan 

argues that an apparently elementary condition of “rationality”—consistency or 

coherence in decisions—is not a desideratum for a social decision process. He 

claims that a consistency requirement fosters rule by consolidated majorities 

rather than shifting coalitions of minorities, and that it stands in the way of social 

experimentation (whereby “competing alternatives may be experimentally and 

provisionally adopted, tested, and replaced by new compromise alternatives”). 

Some Conditions on Social Choice Rules 

The aim of social choice theory is to formalize requirements on collective choice 

rules—on the aggregation of individual preferences into a collective will—and to 

consider whether or not it is possible for a collective choice rule to jointly satisfy 

those conditions. The requirements are normative (as Arrow puts it, they express 

value judgments), and the concern is with the consistency of those judgments). 

In the cases of particular interest to us, they reflect the idea that the collective 

choice is to combine the interests of individuals, understood as equals. What we 

want to know is whether there is any aggregation that both treats individuals as 

equals—where the conditions provide precise expression to that intuitive 

idea—and that results in a rational collective decision. 

1. Unrestricted Domain: This condition says that the domain of the 

collective choice rule includes all logically possible individual profiles, for 

i=1,2,...,n over X. Recall that a profile is collection (an n-tuple) of orderings. So 

unrestricted domain does not require that the collective choice rule yield a social 

ranking over all possible rankings, but over all possible rankings that meet the 

minimal rationality conditions. 

U is one possible condition on a collective choice rule, but not a condition 

mandated by the social choice framework. So for example, an alternative 

condition would be to say that the domain of a collective choice rule is to be 

limited to collections of rankings that human beings might plausibly hold, or to 

substantively reasonable individual rankings. 

It is sometimes said (by way of objection) that social choice theory takes 

preferences as given. And in a way that is true. It treats preferences and values 

as the domain of the collective choice rule, and does not model the ways that 

processes of collective decision may shape preferences and values: “individual 

values are taken as data and are not capable of being altered by the nature of 

the decision process itself” (7). But U takes preferences and values as given in a 

stronger sense that is not part of the social choice framework itself. It requires 

that a collective choice rule give us rational decisions, whatever those inputs are. 

The next four conditions are "responsiveness" requirements. These 

conditions require that collective preferences depend positively on the 

preferences (orderings) of individuals. The intent of these conditions is to capture 

the idea that individuals are to be treated as equals in the aggregation of 

preferences, but—as we will see—the conditions in effect render the idea that 

individuals are to be treated as equals by requiring that the aggregation give 

equal weight to the individual orderings. 

2. Pareto: if one alternative if higher than another in each individual 

ordering, then it is higher in the social ranking (for all i, xP y then xPy). This is an
i

apparently weak condition of positive responsiveness; I don't want now to explore 

objections to it, only to say that it is weaker than the condition of responsiveness 

that is commonly known as monotonicity. 

3. Monotonicity: if an alternative improves in at least one individual 

ranking, then it should not decline in the social ranking: if it is already the winner, 

it should remain so; if it in a tie, it should not lose. This condition is stronger than 

Pareto because it constrains the collective choice even in cases in which there is 

no unanimous judgment among individuals. 

You can see the power of monotonicity by noting that systems with 

elections that occur in stages violate it: for example, systems with a runoff 

between the top two candidates in a first round election. Thus suppose we have 

an election with three candidates: Bush, Kerry, and Nader. In case 1, the vote is 

8-7-6 (respectively) in the first round; in the second, the Nader voters—who are 

evenly divided on their second choice—split their votes and Bush wins 11-10. In 

case 2, the preferences are the same except that two of Kerry’s supporters have 

shifted to Bush: so Bush wins 10-5-6. But in round 2, we have a run-off between 

Bush and Nader, and all five Kerry supporters support Nader as their second 

choice. So Nader wins 11-10: Bush does worse by doing better, and this violates 

the monotonicity condition, which rules out electoral schemes that permit such 

negative responsiveness. 

3a. Strong monotonicity: this condition treats everyone as a tie-breaker. 

So if the division of support is such as to generate a tie or victory for Jones, then 

if one vote shifts to Jones, then Jones wins. 

4. Liberty: for each person, there exists at least one pair of alternatives 

(x,y) such that the social ranking (which is socially better) is fixed by the 

individual's own ranking. if xP y then x is socially better (xPy) and if yP x then y is
i
i

socially better (yPx). 

Note that Liberty does not capture the idea of an individual's having 

control over a decision: indeed, Liberty would be satisfied by an omniscient, 

benevolent, non-paternalistic dictator (in the familiar non-social choice theoretic 

sense of dictator). Thus if the dictator knew what subjects preferred, was 

concerned with their welfare, and non-paternalistically accepted their own 

preferences as dispositive as to their welfare, then the dictator's judgments would 

satisfy Liberty. So it is another condition on responsiveness, this time to 

particular persons. 

4a. Minimal Liberty: for at least two individuals (though perhaps not for all) 

there exists at least one pair of alternatives such that the social ranking is fixed 

by the individual's own ranking: two persons, and two pairs of alternatives, such 

that if xP y then xPy and if yP x then yPx.
i
i

5. Non-Dictatorship: it is not the case that there exists an individual whose 

ordering matches the social ranking in this sense: xP y if and only if xPy. Notice
i

that this is a very special sense of "dictatorship," in a way that parallels the 

special sense of "right" in the Liberty condition. Thus the dictator is not someone 

who controls outcomes, but someone who rankings match the social ranking: put 

otherwise, a dictator is someone who has authority over all pairs, in just the way 

that the right-bearers in Liberty have authority over one pair. 

The final three conditions are "invariance requirements." Formally 

speaking, an invariance requirement is a condition on a function, such that the 

output of the function remains fixed so long as certain input conditions remain 

fixed, not matter what happens to other features of the world: so that output is 

invariant under various sorts of transformation. In the case at issue, invariance 

requirements require that the aggregation function give the same result so long 

as certain aspects of the individual orderings are held fixed. So they are 

invariance conditions because they require that the function from individual 

rankings to a social ranking be invariant even as the characteristics of individuals 

or their circumstances change. The invariance conditions have the effect of 

limiting the range of information that the collective choice rule can look at by 

requiring that the output of the function remain fixed, even if certain conditions 

change. Less abstractly put, the effect of the invariance conditions is to force 

collective decisions to pay attention only to certain facts about individual 

preferences. 

6. Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives: roughly, the social ranking of a 

pair of alternatives is to depend only on the rankings of that pair by individuals. 

So if we take two profiles in which all the individual rankings of the two 

alternatives are identical, then the social ranking from those profiles must be the 

same, no matter how much the other features of the situation vary. To see the 

effect of this condition, consider the following array: 

Smith  x,y,z 

Jones  x,y,z 

Brown  y,x,z 

Suppose now that the collective choice works this way: assign 3 points to the 

best, then 2, then 1; add up, and determine social rankings by the scores. So 

with this array, x is socially better than y since x beats y 8 to 7. But now imagine 

an array the same but for Brown, who reverses the order of x and z. With this 

array, x and y now tie for the socially best. But the change in the social ranking of 

x and y (from preference to indifference) does not reflect any change in the 

individual orderings of x and y, which remain precisely as before. So this 

collective choice rule violates I. So does a utilitarian collective choice rule, since 

cardinal utilities are necessary (though not sufficient) for the summation of 

utilities, but constructing a cardinal utility measure requires information (roughly, 

about intensities) not contained in pairwise comparisons. 

I is very strong, particularly if we think of a collective choice rule as an 

aggregation rule. It says, in effect, that the only information relevant to social 

choice—the only facts relevant as a foundation for political advice—are facts 

about pairwise individual orderings. So collective choice cannot consider 

preference intensities, or depend on interpersonal comparisons of utilities: this is 

a point that Arrow emphasizes, when he says that “the viewpoint will be taken 

here that interpersonal comparison of utilities has no meaning” (9). But I is much 

stronger, because it says that the collective ordering must remain invariant 

whatever changes there may be in objective conditions as well: position in the 

distribution of resources; their health, abilities, needs, etc..4 The collective 

preference is to be fully fixed by individual pairwise orderings, in the following 

sense: if we impose the Independence condition, then facts other than individual 

preferences can freely vary without affecting the collective preference, which is 

fixed simply by the order in individual preferences: same orderings, same 

collective decision. 

Independence is a natural condition to impose if we identify treating 

individuals as equals with giving equal weight to their preferences. But suppose 

we think that the idea that individuals are to be treated as equals supports giving 

additional weight to the well-being of the person whose circumstances are worst. 

Then we need to reject I, because it does not permit us to look at any factors 

beyond preferences. 

7. Anonymity: This condition requires that the collective choice depend 

only on the preferences (individual rankings), not on who has the preferences. 

Thus, if we hold the array of preferences fixed, while permuting the individuals 

who have the preferences, the result must be the same. This condition appears 

4 See Amartya Sen’s review of Arrow’s collected papers [ref]. 

to be associated with a requirement of equality: for example, it excludes schemes 

of weighted voting of the kind favored by John Stuart Mill, who thought that 

educated voters should get multiple votes. But notice that it also excludes a 

scheme in which a winner is chosen on the basis of the number of districts the 

candidate wins. Suppose there are 15 voters equally divided into three districts. 

Then if the division of the vote is 3-2/3-2/3-2 in favor of Jones over Smith, Jones 

wins. But now suppose it is 5-0/2-3/2-3. Then Smith wins: even though the set of 

preferences is the same, the fact that the preferences are differently distributed 

across voters changes the result. Notice, too, that it is not obvious that this 

scheme—as distinct from a system of weighted voting—violates the requirement 

of treating people as equals. Indeed, the scheme of district voting assigns no 

one, ex ante, greater impact on the outcome than anyone else. 

8. Neutrality (Outcome Indifference): The intuitive idea is that the social 

choice function should not itself favor one or another alternative. The social 

choice should, so to speak, not depend on intrinsic features of the alternatives 

but only on how they are ranked by individuals. So if each person’s preferences 

over a pair of alternatives reverses, the resulting social choice should also 

reverse. This requirement also seems intuitively plausible. But notice that it is 

violated if we require, as a way of protecting majorities—including the political 

rights of minorities—agreement from a large majority before passing a law 

restricting those rights (say, amending the constitution): if the vote is 60-40 

against, the amendment loses; but if it is 60-40 in favor, the amendment still 

loses. In such a case, it seems entirely appropriate that the procedure for making 

decisions violate neutrality. 

Some Results 

Having described the framework of collective choice theory, and some of the 

conditions that have been proposed as appropriate to impose on collective 

choices rules, lets now consider some of the central results, all of which are 

about the implications of imposing these conditions. 

1. May's Theorem: May proved that, when there are two alternatives, 

simple majority rule is the only social choice function that satisfies Unrestricted 

Domain, Strong Monotonicity, Anonymity, and Neutrality: the alternative with one 

more than half the support wins. If there are more than two alternatives, then 

majority rule is no longer a social decision function (as the voting paradox 

indicates).5 

2. Sen's Liberalism Theorem. The Paretian-Liberty Theorem states that 

there is no social decision function that satisfies conditions U, P, and L: that is, 

no social decision function that, whatever the individual rankings, produces a 

social ranking that both respects the rankings of individuals over the alternatives 

that lie within their personal domains, and at the same time is responsive to the 

rankings of members, taken collectively. 

5 For discussion of May's theorem, see Ackerman, Social Justice in the Liberal State; Dahl, Democracy 
and Its Critics; Beitz, Political Equality. 

For reasons that will become clear, all of the examples that illustrate the 

problem have an artificial air. Suppose, then, that the legislature is to have a 

debate that will issue in a vote. The following conditions obtain: 

1. There are two members (parties) each of whom will be given an

opportunity to speak. 

2. The rules of the body set aside 2 hours for debate.

3. There must be some debate before the vote, but all the time need not

be used up. 

4. Remarks may last for either 75 minutes or 45 minutes, but there cannot

be two 45 minute speeches. 

5. Each party has the right to respond: if A uses some time, then B has the

right to use some time. 

6. Although each party would prefer to keep the debate short each also

wants to talk longer than the opposing party, and in fact thinks that as between 

talking shorter and not talking at all, better to not talk at all. Here then are the 

preferences of the parties: 

Party A 

(45, 0) 

(75,45) 

(0,45) 

(45,75) 

Party B 

(0,45) 

(45,75) 

(45,0) 

(75,45) 

Now, the problem: Since A has the right to respond (0,45) is beaten by 

(75,45); since B has the right to respond, (45,0) is beaten by (45,75). But (75,45) 

is beaten by (45,0): if there, in any case, to be an imbalance of time, reduce the 

time spent. And (45,75) loses to (0,45): same theory. So everything loses: two 

alternatives by the exercise of rights, two by the application of Pareto. Put 

otherwise, if A faces (0,45) then A will exercise the right to reply, giving (75,45). 

But both prefer (45,0). But if they face (45,0), then B will exercise the right of 

reply, and talk for 75 minutes. But then they would both prefer that B be briefer 

and A not bother at all. 

That's an example. I will not go through the proof, which is pretty 

straightforward. 

3. Arrow's Theorem. We come now to Arrow's theorem. What Arrow 

showed is that there is no social welfare function that satisfies Unrestricted 

Domain, Independence, Pareto, and Non-Dictatorship. Put otherwise, if a social 

welfare function satisfies Pareto, Independence, and Unrestricted Domain, then 

there must be a Dictator in the special sense noted earlier: not someone who 

actually controls the decisions (we may not even be aware who the dictator is), 

but someone whose ranking, whatever it is, corresponds to the social ranking. 

The conditions on a social welfare function are meant to capture the 

intuitive idea that a coherent collective ranking, suited to guiding collective 

decisions, should depend on individual rankings, where individuals are treated as 

equals. So the conclusion is that the very idea of rational collective choice may 

be incoherent, where such choice is understood to require picking the best 

element from a consistent social ranking that reflects individual rankings. Thus 

understood the result may appear to face a problem: if we think that the condition 

of rationality is captured by a range condition of acyclicity rather than transitivity 

(find a social decision function), then Arrow's conditions can be satisfied. But this 

will not do as a reply because there are related theorems—due to Gibbard, and 

Brown—that show that a social decision function that satisfies Arrow's conditions 

will guarantee a quasi-transitive or acyclic social order only if there exists a group 

in the population that can veto the choice of the rest of the group. 

The large issue about the theorem, then, turns on the reasonableness of 

the four conditions on the social welfare function. Arrow's theorem causes trouble 

if we accept the idea that is enforced through I—that the standards to be used for 

evaluating collective decisions and arrangements for making such decisions are 

to be constructed from individual preferences (binary orders), taken as having 

equal weight. But there are good reasons for doubting this condition: in the 

special setting of binding collective choice, preferences as such may have little if 

any weight; whatever their role in explaining conduct, they do not, as such, 

provide a basis for claims on others that a collective decision needs to take into 

account. 

An alternative understanding of the idea of a collective decision, 

suggested by Rousseau's notion of a general will based on shared or 

“generalizable” interests. Suppose that we aim to construct the collective will by 

confining attention to certain fundamental interests of individuals—for example, in 

Rousseau's case, interests in protection of person and goods, and in personal 

independence, or in the case of Rawls’s theory of justice, interests in the primary 

goods of basic liberty, opportunity, income and wealth, and self-respect. The 

notion of fundamental interests is a normative notion: these are the interests in 

the name of which persons may reasonably make demands on others, 

acknowledging those others as equals who may make similar demands. The key 

point is that the individual preferences, interests, and values that are to play a 

role in justifying political principles that apply to arrangements of binding 

collective choice must satisfy certain conditions suited to the special problem of 

justifying such arrangements, and—more particularly—suited to justifying 

arrangements that capture the idea that people are to be treated as equals in the 

making of binding collective decisions. Since we are concerned with justifying 

norms, not explaining the operation of institutions of collective choice, such 

constraints are appropriate. Once we confine ourselves to inputs that pass 

through such a filter, then, depending on how these notions are developed—what 

precisely the interests are, and the extent to which they are shared—we may well 

be able to generate a set of principles that define a coherent collective ranking.
