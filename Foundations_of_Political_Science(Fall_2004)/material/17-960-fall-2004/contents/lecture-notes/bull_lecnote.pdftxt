Class on Hedley Bull 

1.	 Some general points about Bull’s view 

A central claim in Bull’s argument is that anarchy—understood as interaction 
between and among agents, whether individuals or states, in the absence of 
a state—is not a single thing with a determinate set of consequences. Even if 
we accept the Hobbesian thesis that a world of separate individuals 
interacting under conditions of anarchy lacks any order, there are still at least 
three forms of anarchy which work very differently from one another: 

(i)	 an anarchical community of the kind that we find within stateless 
societies, where order among clans and lineages groups, with partially 
overlapping competences, is preserved in part because of a high 
degree of cultural homogeneity and social solidarity, and the rules 
enforced by groups are understood as having religious or natural 
status and a special authority owing to that status form of special 
owing to are according to custom and tradition; 

(ii)  an anarchical international system (anarchical state system) with a 
plurality of states and no element of society (as Hobbes thought of 
international society) or none that plays a consequential role, in which 
order is preserved through the separate states acting on their own 
interests and/or values and principles, and not on the basis of a sense 
of common interests or an understanding of being bound by common 
rules and institutions; 

(iii) an anarchical international society, in which order among states is 
maintained by the existence of an international society that does not 
operate in the shadow of the state: that is, by a sense of common or 
shared interests/values, and a sense of being bound by common rules 
and institutions (habits, practices, and organizations). 

Focusing for now on the second and third forms of anarchy, the point is that 
there are distinct possible sources of order under conditions of anarchy; 
moreover, these distinct sources of order lead, so Bull seems to say (though 
less precisely and in a less focused way than would be desirable), to different 
patterns of order. So because anarchy comes in these varieties—the pure 
system variety and the social variety—we cannot conclude from the absence 
of a state that the factors relevant to understanding and explaining either 
foreign policy or international politics (regular patterns of interaction among 
states) can be reduced to the interests of states and the distribution of power 
or capabilities among them. Instead, the interactions of states may be 
embedded within a social background—a background that includes ideas and 
norms—that shapes the conduct of individual states and the patterns of their 
interaction. The central point—denied by Hobbes and suggested in Locke—is 

that the existence of a society, expressed in ideas and norms with real 
consequences for interaction—does not depend on the existence of a state. 

2.	 Central Ideas in Bull’s View: 

a)  Much of Bull’s presentation takes the form of stating definitions and 
presenting classifications. It is essential in understanding the view 
to understand the distinctions, but not to get lost in them. We want 
to understand the distinctions and then use them to get some 
argumentative traction: that is, to get past the definitions, 
distinctions, and clarifications of concepts and to see what 
substantial claims about international politics Bull is advancing, who 
he is disagreeing with, and how those disagreements might be 
adjudicated. 

b)  Main Concepts: 

•	

In general, an order is a pattern of activity that advances a goal. 
Not part of the existence of an order that the agents in the order 
aim at the goal or follow rules in achieving it (6-7). So for 
example, a perfectly competitive market is an order that 
advances efficiency, without that being the aim of any 
participant in the order. Important to the view that order gets 
defined independent of the means for achieving and sustaining 
it, that is, independently of its causes, which may include rules 
and institutions. 

•	 We have order in social life iff we have a pattern of activity that 
advances the basic goals of a society, namely: protection 
against violence; keeping agreements; and protecting property. 
What makes these goals basic: (i) would not call “a constellation 
of persons and groups” a society unless pattern of activity 
among them advances these goals; preconditions for pursuing 
other goals; universal. NB: the third point seems to be 
redundant: if a collection does not count as a society unless it 
advances these goals, then it follows that “all actual societies” 
advance them. If all possible societies advance them, then 
surely all actual societies do. 

•	

International Order when we have a pattern of activity between 
and among states that sustains the basic goals of the society of 
states, which include: (i) goals of all social life (security, 
agreement, property); (ii) preservation of state system of states; 
(iii) maintaining independence of the separate units; (iv)
preserving peace. 

•	

International (or State) System: a plurality of states that 
regularly interact, so that the well-being of each depends on the 
conduct of others and such that each needs to take the likely 
conduct of others into account in deciding what to do. 

•	 An international society (society of states) is a system of 
(interacting) states in which the members form a society, that is: 
(i) have a sense of common interests and/or values, (ii) regard
themselves as bound by common rules, which provide 
standards of conduct; and (iii) cooperate in making common 
institutions operate. 

•	 A world order is a pattern of activity that advances the three 
basic goals of social life—security, promise-keeping, stability of 
possessions—for mankind as a whole. 

c)	 Main Theses 

•	 Order is one important good, but it is distinct from justice, and 
the preservation of world order may be neither necessary nor 
sufficient for achieving justice. 

•	 One form of world order is a global state system, but there may 
be other ways to achieve world order (global state, federation of 
states, for example). So there is a substantial question—to 
which the best current answer is affirmative—about whether the 
state system is the best way to foster world order. 

•	

In principle, international order—order in relations among 
states—could exist on the basis of an international system, 
which is not embedded in an international society: this appears 
to be a standard Realist thesis, that order can exist without a 
society or state. In this case, there would be order—pattern of 
activity that advances the goals of a society of states, including 
the three basic goals of social life—even though the pattern 
would not be sustained by such social facts as norms and 
institutions, but only by the separate efforts of states to advance 
their own interests and values on the basis of their capabilities. 
NB: The definition of international order—which refers to the 
goals of a society of states—may be confusing on this point, 
because it might suggest that an international order requires as 
a conceptual matter the existence of a society of states. But the 
connection between society and order, to the extent that such 
connection exists, is substantive not conceptual (62-63): it is not 

a conceptual truth that only a society of states can advance 
those goals. 

•	 Grotian Thesis: Modern state system, in its various incarnations 
(Christian, European, and World International Society) has 
always been in part an international society, in that there has 
been a sense of common interests, and of common rules 
accepted and common institutions upheld through cooperation. 
Moreover, that social element—shared interests/values, 
accepted rules, and institutions—has exerted an influence on 
the conduct of states. 

(a) Thus the Grotian Thesis has two main components: (i) 
Descriptive Grotian Thesis (DGT): agents in the modern 
state system are, in some measure, members of an 
international society in that they are aware of shared 
interests/values, and regard themselves as bound by 
common rules and common institutions; and (ii) 
Explanatory Grotian Thesis (EGT): order in the various 
forms of modern state system—that there is order, and 
the kind of order there is—is in part a result of the fact 
that states are embedded in such an international 
society. As this two-part statement of the Grotian Thesis 
indicates, the claim is not simply that the state system is 
embedded in a society of states, but that the social 
element—awareness of shared interests/values, an 
understanding of being bound by common rules, and 
sharing in common institutions—is in some measure a 
source of international order. 

(b)  And there are, correspondingly, two ways to reject the
Grotian Thesis: (i) reject DGT, with its idea that there are 
common interests, rules, institutions in the various forms 
of the modern state system. Call this “social nihilism”: 
international politics is not socially embedded; (ii) reject 
EGT, with its idea that the conduct of states and, more 
particularly, patterns of order in international politics are 
in any substantial way explained by the social element 
(sense of shared interests, or of being bound by common 
rules and institutions). And this rejection might take one 
of two forms, which could be called social 
epiphenomenalism and social intervening variable-ism. 
Social epiphenomenalism accepts that there is the social 
element, but denies that it exerts influence on practice (or 
perhaps any influence on aspects of international 
practice that are of particular interest). Social intervening 

variable-ism is the view that the social element is an 
intervening factor in the causal chain from non-societal 
facts (interest and power) to patterns of order, but is itself 
explained by those underlying non-societal facts (say by 
the ability of a dominant power or powers to get others to 
sing the same tune). 

(c) The issue here is a little more complicated than this 
because Bull understands institutions capaciously, to 
include not just organizations, but also such habits and 
practices as war, balance of power, existence of great 
powers, and diplomacy. So the Realist who rejects EGT 
may well agree that these institutions do help to promote 
the three basic social goals. The Realist sees these 
institutions themselves as the product of the pursuit of 
state interests, given the distribution capabilities. In 
contrast, Bull sees, for example, the balance of power as 
also emerging in some cases from policies guided by the 
aim of balancing (rather than the aim of increasing 
relative power) or by the aim of preserving the overall 
balance in the system (101-02). So a disagreement 
remains, about how and when the institutions produce 
order: Bull thinks that institutions, like rules, can provide 
standards that guide state conduct to the achievement of 
shared interests and values. With this idea of rules and/or 
institutions as independent factors shaping the conduct of 
states and patterns in their interactions, Realists 
disagree. 

3.	 Defense of the Grotian Thesis 

a)  Need first to show that—contrary to social nihilism—in the different 
phases of the modern state system, states have a sense of 
common interests/values, of being bound by common rules, of 
sharing in common institutions: this is essential to defending the 
DGT. 

•	 Consider the case of rules: so rules are norms, standards of 
conduct, not simple patterns or regularities of conduct. So 
among the rules in international politics are rules of membership 
(e.g., that states are the only members, only bearers of rights 
and obligations), coexistence (use of violence, keeping 
agreements, ownership of property/control of territory), and 
cooperation. These rules express interests/values—provide 
definite standards for advancing interests—and are made, 

interpreted, enforced, and protected by institutions (including 
diplomacy, balance of power, war, organizations, great powers). 

•	

In some cases, there is no such shared framework of rules and 
institutions: Mongol invaders and their enemies; Christian and 
Islamic societies; Conquistadors and Indian populations (and in 
modern settings, Wilsonians and others). In each case, there 
are (arguably) ethical ideas that justify policy, but the ideas are 
not shared. So the Mongols have a story of carrying out the 
Mandate of Heaven, but the peoples they were seeking to 
control did not share that idea. Now you might ask: what 
difference would it have made if the ideas had been shared. 
And I think Bull’s response would be that if the Mongol ideas 
had been accepted by others, there would have been no need 
for invasion, but also—and more importantly—that peoples do 
not accept ideas that call for their own subjugation. So had there 
been shared ideas, then the Mongols might not have had any 
rationale for subjugating, and perhaps would have been less 
likely to subjugate. 

•	 But in the case of the modern state system (in its different 
phases), the major players do appeal to common ideas and 
norms: we find these ideas and norms expressed in theoretical 
statements and correspondingly in the statements and 
arguments advanced by statesmen. Now Bull is pretty casual 
with the kinds of evidence that he uses to argue against social 
nihilism. So for example he says that even during WWII, the 
Nazis respected ordinary rules in the relations with other Axis 
powers. But then may be said for Mongol invaders, 
Conquistadors, and jihadists. And he says that some members 
of each belligerent group sought a basis for negotiated peace: 
but that is a weak basis for asserting that the social ideas are 
shared among states. 

•	 But lets not dwell here because most Realists, who do not think 
the social element matters in the way that the Grotian does, can 
accept the DGT: they need not deny—and typically do not 
deny—that there are shared norms, but will argue that shared 
norms are not causally fundamental because they may 
themselves be the product of the power of status quo powers to 
win acceptance through what Carr calls “power over opinion” of 
norms that advance their national interests (TYC, pp. 132-45). 
The traction must lie elsewhere. Carr and Morgenthau, for 
example, do not deny the existence of shared norms, but argue 
that an essential task of analyses of international politics is to 
see the political forces that lie behind them (see PAN, p. 111). 

b)  So what about EGT? What sorts of evidence does Bull have that 
the social element “exert(s) an influence,” which means that it is a 
source of order and perhaps of order with distinct patterns. 

•	 A first point, deep and interesting, might be thought of as a 
challenge to the distinction I have drawn between DGT and 
EGT. Thus DGT says that we live in a world in which states feel 
bound (in some measure) to justify their conduct by reference to 
rules and standards that other states accept—as distinct from a 
world in which they acknowledge no need to justify or are 
prepared to justify to themselves in light of their own views. Now 
suppose we think also that the justifying ideas that other states 
accept must give some weight to their own interests: that there 
is, as Carr says, some limit to power over opinion (144-45). Now 
states regard themselves as bound to justify their conduct by 
reference to ideas that give some weight to the interests of other 
states as well. And the thesis is that even if the appeal to these 
ideas is a pretext—a disguise for the real motives that lie behind 
a state’s conduct—that the need to find a pretext is itself a 
constraint, and the element of society expressed in the 
requirement of finding a suitable rationale will foster order. Bull 
gives no examples, and it is not clear that the need to find an 
acceptable rationale is quite so constraining. But it is worth 
investigating this proposed constraint: to the extent that it has 
force, international orders embedded in international societies 
will be more stable than those that are not. 

•	 Second, we have the case of balances of power that require 
contrivance: where states are guided in their conduct not by a 
concern to advance their own power, with balance as the 
unintended product, but cases in which the balance is the 
product of a coordinated policy of balancing guided by the goal 
of achieving a system in balance. 

•	 Similarly, the social element is expressed when we have wars to 
enforce international law (esp. to enforce third party rights), or to 
preserve the balance of power: here again, the claim is that we 
have cases in which states act as agents for the order itself. 

•	 Now both of these cases may seem like arguments about 
foreign policy, not international politics. But insofar as there is a 
distinction to be made there, the arguments may have 
implications for both. So it may be that when we consider the 
patterns on the balance of power, for example, we find strands 

that cannot be explained without supposing that states 
sometimes act with the intention of ensuring an overall balance, 
not with the intention of increasing their own relative power. 

•	 Then we have two kinds of cases in which the social element is 
said to be effective when you would lest expect it: (i) first, in 
periods of peace that follow war (40). But this claim seems 
wrong. It is hard to see why a period of peace requires social 
explanation. Here Bull seems to be confusing the DGT with the 
EGT, and simply to be observing that after a period of conflict, 
appeal is made once more to ideas about shared interest, 
norms, and institutions; (ii) then we have cases in which the 
social element is said to be present even during periods of 
intense conflict, such as WWII or the Cold War. Here again, the 
case seems weak. Thus Nazi Germany treated its allies in 
accordance with ordinary rules; there were people in Nazi 
Germany who sought to negotiate; and the Geneva conventions 
were respected: not clear why any of these behaviors require 
explanation by reference to an independent importance of 
norms and institutions, however the parties themselves may 
have presented or thought about what they were doing. 

This is not the place to assess the different forms of evidence. Suffice to say that 
there does seem to be a distinctive view, for the truth of which real evidence 
could be brought to bear.
