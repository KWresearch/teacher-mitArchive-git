Hayek Session, September 17, 2004 

Core idea of the rule of law is, roughly, the following: government is to guide and limit 

the exercise of its coercive power—legislative, executive, and administrative—by 

reference to norms that are general, rather than focused on particular people; public, 

rather than secret decrees; announced in advance, rather than after the fact; and 

reasonably stable. Government ought consistently and impartially to enforce such 

norms. To achieve this, there needs to be a judiciary that operates independent of 

political branches and parties and that has an obligation to be faithful to the legal 

materials. 

The diverse arguments in favor of the rule of law suggest that this restriction on 

the use of collective power serves values of personal security, liberty, equality, the 

general welfare, and community. The requirement of generality is said to promote the 

value of personal security by limiting the discretionary exercise of power, thus protecting 

people from abuse. The conditions of generality and stability serve the value of liberty in 

part by requiring that individuals not be subordinate to (at the mercy of) the demands of 

other individuals; and the conditions of publicity and prior announcement serve liberty 

by requiring that people in effect be informed in advance about which forms of conduct 

are permissible. This makes the exercise of power more predictable, enabling people to 

plan, to regulate their own conduct, and coordinate their conduct with others, which 

promotes the general welfare. The restrictions serve the value of equality because the 

generality of rules and consistency in their enforcement ensures, in at least certain 

minimal ways, that equal cases will be treated equally, regardless of the particular 

people involved. And generality serves the value of community by establishing a 

common framework of norms for all in the society. 

Hayek provides a more ambitious argument for the rule of law. He thinks that the 

rule of law is a more or less sufficient condition for the protection of liberty, which he 

takes to be the basic political value. While it is possible for a system with rule of law to 

have severe restrictions on liberty, it is very unlikely. So Hayek is saying the following: 

1. Necessity of Rule Law: IF you are aiming to protect personal liberty, then there 

are compelling reasons for doing so via rule of law: that the rule of law is more or 

less necessary for the protection of liberty. So it is consistent with this first thesis 

that there could be a legal order that is not protective of liberty: what it says is 

that there could not be a free society without the rule of law; but there could be 

an oppressive society with the rule of law. 

2. Sufficiency of Rule of Law: But he is also saying, more strongly, that if you have 

the rule of law—if the exercise of coercion is confined to the enforcement of 

abstract and general rules—then the result is very likely to be a secure protection 

of liberty. He is arguing for a strong connection between, so to speak, form and 

content: the form of law as such is strongly liberty-protecting, meaning that the 

rule of law is (with some possible exceptional cases) is sufficient for the 

protection of liberty. 

3. Priority of Liberty/Rule of Law: As a corollary of the first thesis: if there are values 

that are difficult to advance in a system with the rule of law—because it is hard to 

advance them through abstract, general rules, because they require discretion, 

contextual judgment—then advancing those values will be destructive of liberty. 

This is true, for example, of equality, except if that means equality before the law. 

These other values must therefore be sacrificed, inasmuch as liberty is basic. 

4. So where Rawls advances an ideal of justice founded of the aim of reconciling 

liberty and equality, Hayek sees a deeper tension, embraces the ideal of a “free 

society” or “state of freedom” and see the rule of law as lying at the heart of this 

ideal: upholding the rule of law is both necessary and (under certain reasonable 

conditions) sufficient for the state of freedom. 

1. What is liberty? 

a)  State of liberty or freedom: reduces coercion as much as possible. So 

liberty is the absence of coercion, and state of liberty is situation in which 

coercion is reduced as low as we can. Conception of liberty: (i) Negative: 

Not ability to do things, but the absence of a specific kind of interference, 

viz. by other intentionally acting agents. Robinson Crusoe is fully free. (ii) 

Distinctive Value: The account of (personal) liberty is not making a point 

about the meaning of the word “liberty,” but about a distinctive evil, viz. 

coercion. Thus personal freedom is said to be a fundamentally different 

value from political freedom, inner freedom (not being enslaved by 

passions), and power; (iii) Arbitrary? Sometimes says liberty is absence 

of arbitrary interference by others. But not consistently affirmed, and 

apparently for good reason. What does arbitrary mean? Either no good 

reason or no prior rule (153). If no good reason, then murderers are free 

when they are jailed because there is a good reason for the interference. If 

presence of prior rule suffices for non-arbitrariness, then argument that 

rule of law gives liberty is a matter of definition. 

b) Three Differences: Distinguishes liberty, as absence of coercion from: (i) 

political freedom, as consent to the political order and its rules. Hayek 

thinks this is the distinct idea of an absence of collective subordination. 

Case that political freedom is fundamentally different from personal 

freedom depends on alienability of political freedom: can consent to 

dependence on tyrant. But if you think that political freedom is a standing 

condition, not an initial state, then the distinction may not be so sharp, 

because will need to preserve the conditions required for giving consent; 

(ii) inner freedom, as mastery of passions and emotions, strength of will, 

which is distinct from presence or absence of interferences from others; 

and (iii) power, as ability to achieve aims: related to what Rawls calls the 

“worth of liberty,” that is, what a person is able to do with his/her liberty, 

understood as absence of coercion. Focusing on the third of these: 

essential point is that limited choices or inability to achieve aims is no 

restriction on freedom, unless it results from coercion. 

c) Unity of Liberty: Unlike Rawls, Hayek emphasizes the “unity of liberty.” 

He think there is one good, which is the absence of coercive interference, 

and that liberty as such is the basic value. He does not distinguish a class 

of liberties that are especially important to protect, but focuses on the 

importance of liberty as such. (Lochner era) 

2. Coercion 

a)  What is it? Person P is coerced just in case (i) P is threatened with harm 

by another person Q (134); (ii) in this threat, Q acts with the intention of 

making it the case that P serves Q’s purposes (134, 137); and (iii) Q 

pursues that intention by threatening to impose or imposing specific 

requirements on P’s conduct (134: “certain conduct”). I put this here as if 

coercion does not come in degrees, but Hayek supposes that it does. So, 

greater coercion when the specificity of the demands is greater, threat is 

larger. 

b)  So, we do not have coercion (i) when there is a highly specific, customary 

code of acceptable conduct that everyone follows in an unreflective way, 

but that is not enforced through a system of threats of harm: but under 

these conditions there does seem to be an absence of freedom (151). 

Also, (ii) if P serves Q’s purposes not because of threats of harm from 

anyone, but because of lack of options on part of P (where that lack is not 

itself the result of threats of harm), then we do not have coercion. This 

seems to be the force of the example at 137, and of Nozick’s examples 

about how restrictions on choices do not imply coercion. And (iii) reduced 

coercion when P threatens Q with harm with then aim of making Q serve 

P’s purposes, but leaves P lots of latitude about how to do it. So less 

coercion when P says “pay me $100 a week” than when P says “work for 

me on building the dog house on the side yard.” 

c)  Why is it bad? (i) Equality argument is that coercion is bad because it 

represents an insult to person by making the person act for your purposes 

rather than his/her own: in treating other as means rather than end, 

coercion establishes subordination; (ii) treating someone as means is 

denial of the dignity of the person which owes to the person’s autonomy, 

understood as capacity for self-regulation, of making a plan of life and 

acting pursuant to that plan. So here the evil of coercion and the case for 

a state of freedom is that people are entitled to be treated with respect as 

autonomous agents; (iii) makes the person’s life worse because it 

suppresses the development and expression of a person’s capacities 

(134); (iv) bad for community welfare because you lose the special 

contribution that comes from person acting on his own knowledge and 

purpose (emphasis on dispersed knowledge). 

d)  Some concerns: (i) suppose that lack of options in the case of the badly 

compensated job comes from enforcement of property rights. So if I took 

some of your stuff, I would not have to take the bad job. So we have threat 

without intention to make the person serve purposes of another. Why isn’t 

this a case of being coerced—my options are restricted by threats of 

harm—and therefore when I take the bad job, I do act under coercion 

(whether it is justified is another matter); (ii) Not clear that freedom is 

absence of coercion by others: so for example, we have restricted 

freedom without threat of harm in the Custom case (151). This looks like a 

case in which there are limits on reflective self-direction, and that 

advancing freedom would not consist in reducing coercion but in enabling 

people to engage in reflective self-direction: life is not your own (p. 13); (iii) 

not obvious how to fit together what is said about what freedom is—viz. 

limiting coercion—and what is said about freedom is good and coercion is 

bad. If coercion is bad because it restricts guidance of conduct by my own 

plans and knowledge or self-development, then why isn’t it bad to fail to 

ensure that people have the circumstances they need to guide their plans 

by their own plans and knowledge or what they need for self-development 

(education, resources, information). The same reason for thinking it is bad 

to make other people follow your designs is also a reason for thinking it is 

bad not to ensure that people are in a position to follow their own. 

3.  When do we have justified coercion? 

a)  When it is needed to protect against private coercion: where this is 

understood protecting each person’s private sphere, in which he/she can 

plan activities. For reasons we will come back to later, the coercion used 

to prevent private coercion is (or can be) less objectionable than the 

private coercion itself: because it is more predictable and avoidable, and 

thus leaves greater scope for individuals to formulate and act on plans. 

b)  Protect against fraud, which is bad for the same reason that coercion is 

(using other as means). 

c)  Permissible to coerce people by taxing them for the general welfare 

(supply of public goods). Why isn’t this a matter of improperly 

subordinating liberty to some other value? When we have public good, not 

making someone serve another person’s design: better for all, but cannot 

be achieved through voluntary decisions. Not an insult: not denying 

capacity for self-regulated conduct. Also, the coercion that is necessary 

(viz. taxation) less objectionable form of coercion because it is predictable 

even if not avoidable. 

d)  Not permissible for mere dislikes (145), though it is not clear why 

enforcing morality is punishing a dislike. 

e)  Not permissible to use coercion for paternalistic reasons. 

f)  Not permissible to use coercion in support of just distribution. Two cases: 

(i)

Equality is not an acceptable rationale, even if it is a desirable 

goal. H focuses on fact that “egalitarians generally” regard 

inequalities due to birth or inheritance as somehow different 

from and more objectionable than inequalities due to natural 

differences of talent (89). Considers family, inheritance, and 

education: are they objectionable inequality-generating 

conditions. Taking just the first: “It seems to be widely 

believed…” But you might defuse the polemical edge—the 

suggestion that there is some sort of unprincipled 

inconsistency—by rejecting the asymmetry, and by 

challenging inequalities of advantage (opportunity and reward) 

with both sources. 

(ii)

distribution according to merit, which Hayek supposes to be 

the main thrust of ideas of distributive justice (objecting to a 

failure of match between rewards and the merit of persons, or 

how deserving they are). Hayek rejects the idea of distribution 

according to moral merit, as opposed to distribution according 

to the value that others place of your services: (a) one problem 

is that we lack the information required for distributing 

according to merit (essentially, effort). One reason for valuing 

freedom is that we want to leave people to act on their 

separate information. (b) second problem is that is takes 

people too sensitive to assessments of others, which may 

against lead them not to act of information that they have; (c) 

Because information is not available, a scheme of distribution 

according to moral merit would end up being an invitation to 

highly discretionary judgments, which would be destructive of 

the equal treatment, predictability, fair notice that comes with 

rule of law…and thus destructive of liberty. 

4.

If there is to be coercion to prevent coercion—that is, to protect liberty—why 

should it happen in enforcing abstract and general rules, announced ex ante? 

Why necessary to have rule of law: confining coercion to the enforcement of 

abstract and general rules, set out ex ante, 

a)  Meaning of abstract and general: if abstract, then does not command 

specific actions; if general, then does not single out specific persons. 

Though H does acknowledge that we can have rules that are general in 

the way that he requires even though they “refer to properties that only 

some people possess” (154). Come back to this. 

b)  Laws as such are relatively non-coercive because the sanctions 

associated them with them are typically avoidable. Thus laws announce 

sanctions (threats of harm) that persons can avoid and (because ex ante 

announcement) know how to avoid: by avoiding the conduct to which the 

sanctions attach. So the sanctions, though coercive, are avoidable. In this 

respect they are like natural facts that we need to take into account in 

deciding what to do. They do not tell us what to do, but only that if I do a 

specified thing, I will be coerced: “provided that I can avoid putting myself 

in such a position, I need never be coerced” (142). This does not seem 

very liberty-protective: I can avoid coercion from law that tells people 

never to go out after 8 PM; or never to wear anything on the head; or that 

bans marriage across the color line. 

c)  What about the unavoidable? Taxes in support of essential functions are 

projects of advancing the general welfare? Though not avoidable they are 

less invasively coercive because they are predictable, and—in contrast 

with corvee—not inconsistent with planning activities and deciding how I 

will spend my time. Their enforcement is independent of what I choose to 

do with my time and effort. 

d)  So “the interference of the coercive power of government with our lives is 

most disturbing when it is neither avoidable nor predictable” (143). It is not 

the threat of harm that is the main evil, but the way that unpredictable 

intrusions keep me from formulating and acting on a plan of life: “shaping 

one’s own life.” Making interferences predictable “deprives them largely of 

the evil nature of coercion” (143). 

5. Why is rule of law sufficient? Why suppose that the legal form has such 

determinately libertarian content? 

a)  Hayek is not saying that a system of liberty-denying abstract and general 

rules is either logically impossible or politically impossible: he considers 

the case of severe restrictions with religious foundation, where those who 

make the laws are prepared to comply with them. 

b)  But he does think that it is socially-politically unlikely that we will get a 

system of general and abstract rules that impose severe constraints on 

liberty, and the essential idea—which you get in different ways in Locke, 

Rousseau, and Rawls—is that if those who make the laws are also bound 

by them, then they won’t make excessively onerous laws, because they 

may end up suffering under the onerous restrictions. Thus Locke: you 

don’t have to worry about arbitrary power when membership of legislative 

assembly varies, because when assembly dissolves, members are 

subjects under the laws, like everyone else” (T2§138). Or Rousseau: “why 

is the general will always right, and why do all constantly want the 

happiness of each of them, if not because everyone applies the word 

“each” to himself and thinks of himself as he votes for all” (SC2.4.5). “The 

chief safeguard…” (155). He has in mind something like Rawls’s veil of 

ignorance: hard to predict what will happen to individuals under abstract 

and general rules. So lawmakers who are required to cast regulations in 

the form of such rules will have strong incentives not to make onerous 

restrictions. And, but for the special case of a religiously orthodox group, 

the lawmakers will want not to be subject to such onerous restrictions. 

c)  Note that the point here applies irrespective of the form of regime: 

regardless of who the lawmakers are, so long as they lawmakers are 

insiders to the society. What is needed is that the lawmakers cannot 

design rules that confer special advantages of themselves because they 

are required to cast the regulations in the form of general and abstract 

rules; and (as part of the rule of such laws) they cannot control the 

application of the rules they make (independent judiciary). 

d)  One bad argument: “so far as men’s actions toward other persons are 

concerned, freedom can never mean more than that they are restricted 

only be general rules” (155). Can’t literally be saying that “p is free” means 

“p’s conduct is restricted only by general rules.” That would make the 

defense of the rule of law by reference to the value of freedom an 

immediate consequence of the definition of the word “freedom.” All that 

Hayek means is that freedom does not consist in the absence of all rules 

or restraints on conduct. 

e)  Several puzzles: 

(i)

Assumption of risk-aversion: suppose rulers are risk takers 

and decide to allocate master/slave positions on the basis of a 

lottery that everyone is subject to. They may be willing to 

accept the risks, esp. if they are small enough, even if they 

assume that there is an equal chance of each person suffering 

from the burden. So generality does not rule out extreme 

demands—detailed demands on conduct—even with equal 

probability of facing the demands that come from general 

rules; 

(ii)

Moreover, generality of a rule does not suffice at all to give 

equal probability. Thus there are cases in which I have a pretty 

good sense how things will work out under a general and 

abstract rule: risks are not equally distributed, though the rule 

is facially neutral. So suppose for example the lawmaker 

adopts the rule: there are to be no political rallies in public 

places. If the lawmaker has resources that will enable him/her 

to have political influence without organizing rallies, then 

lawmaker may be willing to accept this perfectly general 

regulation which does impose onerous restrictions on others 

(this is a reason for a thicker veil of ignorance than you get 

from the requirement of generality and abstractness). Or there 

could be a ban on messages critical of the government. Or 

suppose I know that capital punishment is more or less never 

imposed on people who have the resources for a good lawyer: 

then I may be willing, precisely because of this predictability, 

to endorse laws with capital sanctions. Or I may endorse an 

extremely onerous system of sales taxes on necessities, 

knowing that the burden on people like me will not be that 

great. Or I endorse a ban on all public displays of headgear, 

knowing that the burdens will fall on minority religious groups 

to which I do not belong and an unlikely ever to belong (again, 

a thicker veil of ignorance is needed to get a result of religious 

liberty, because it is needed to establish the possibility that the 

burdened subject will be you). 

(iii)

Troubles are still greater because Hayekian generality does 

not mean facial neutrality. Recall that laws can be general 

even though they single out certain groups: for example, 

women, or the blind, or people above a certain age. So for 

example, there is apparently no failure of generality in a law 

that says that the blind may not drive, or that women must 

consult a doctor before having an abortion. But if those laws 

are general, despite mentioning categories of people, then so 

is a law that says that Native Americans may not be outside at 

night. Or that Catholics must stay inside on Sunday. These 

rules are no less general than a rule against driving blind. And 

Hayek seems to acknowledge this. Because after mentioning 

the permissibility of regulations that refer to properties that 

only some people possess, he says that the distinctions that 

such laws draw “will not be arbitrary, will not subject one group 

to the will of another, if they are equally recognized as justified 

by those inside and outside the group” (154). Translated: this 

says that the laws in question will not be coercive [will not 

subject one group to the will of the other] if insiders and 

outsiders both believe they are justified. But absent a very 

strong assumption about social harmony, nothing in the 

requirement that lawmakers, regardless of regime type, make 

general rules suggests the conclusion that they will use such 

non-arbitrary categories: that is, categories who relevance is 

broadly accepted. Some general rules still use arbitrary 

classifications, and therefore are coercive. So nothing in the 

condition of generality, as now understood, provides strong 

assurances against coercion or, correspondingly, strong 

protections of freedom. This is not a surprise: what makes 

categories non-arbitrary is that they are broadly accepted. But 

governing through general rules is not the same as governing 

through broad consent. 

(iv)

Now, as I have said, you can see the Hayekian argument 

about the rule of law as having affinity with Rawls’s idea of the 

veil of ignorance: the shared thought is that if you cannot 

insulate yourself from the onerous burdens of a regulation, 

then you are not going to pick an onerous regulation. 

Generality I am saying provides very little insulation. But the 

common idea is that if people makes rules under conditions 

which are such that they have to live with the results of the 

decisions that they make for others, then we will get a freedom 

protecting set of laws. But Rawls’s point about the 

reconciliation of liberty and equality is that if you impose a 

thick enough veil of ignorance to get the inability and insulate 

and thus a compelling case for equal liberties, then you will 

also get a case for a more egalitarian view of distributive 

justice because they will also want to ensure themselves that 

their liberty will be worth something. We will only be indifferent 

to a severely limited worth of liberty if we are able to insulate 

ourselves from that limited state.
