RECONCILING LIBERTY AND EQUALITY: JUSTICE AS FAIRNESS


1. Two Arguments for Equality

Libertarians make  two  kinds  of  criticisms  of  policies  that  aim  to  address 

economic  inequalities.  Instrumental  criticisms  claim  that  such  policies  have 

bad  effects. For  example,  those  programs are  sometimes  criticized  for 

generating  inefficiency by distorting market prices and  limiting  incentives  to 

work and  invest;  sometimes  for  requiring a  large  regulatory apparatus  that will 

be captured by organized  interests seeking  to use  that apparatus  to advance 

their  own  narrow  interests;  sometimes  for  requiring  a  concentration  of  political 

power  that  threatens  liberties of  conscience,  thought, and  political participation. 

A  second,  distinctively  libertarian  philosophical  criticism  is  that  the  programs 

are unjust because they violate an  individual right to  liberty. 

I mention  this  distinction  now  because we  can,  correspondingly, 

distinguish  arguments  in  favor of  polices  that  aim  to  correct  for  socio-economic 

inequalities  into  two  distinct  types.  Instrumental  defenses  deny  that  the  policies 

have the grave disadvantages alleged by critics: the negative incentive effects, 

for example, are said  to be  relatively small, because supply of  labor and other 

resources  in not that responsive  to expected  rewards. More positively,  the 

egalitarian might argue  that  reducing  inequality  is good  for  the general welfare 

and/or that extreme  inequality is bad for democracy. 

Consider  the  general welfare argument. One  version  starts  from  the 

premise  of  diminishing  returns  to  investments  in  a  person’s  education  and 

Justice,  Fall  2003—2 

training: so  the productivity gains  that come  from greater  investments  in people 

with  higher  levels  of  human  capital  are  smaller  than  the  gains  from  the  same 

investment  in people at  lower  levels. So society would do well  to  invest more  in 

the education and  training of members of society who have  relative small 

amounts  of  education  and  training  (and  assuming  imperfections  in  capital 

markets  that make  it hard  for  individuals  to  finance  their own education and 

training). Those  investments will  bring  greater market  income  for  those 

individuals,  thus  reducing  income  dispersion. But  they will  also  bring  greater 

gains  for society: according  to  the general welfare argument,  they will promote 

both general-welfare-enhancing growth and equality  (of opportunity and of 

outcome).1 

The egalitarian might also argue  that great  inequality  is bad  for 

democracy. One version of the argument says that when people are very 

unequal  in  resources and  living  conditions,  they do not  think of  themselves as 

belonging  to  a  single  political  community:  as  a  result,  the  basic  solidarities 

required  for  a well-functioning democracy are  undermined, and  the 

consequence  is  increased  social  conflict,  unwillingness  to  make  sacrifices, 

diminished  civic  participation,  and  great  difficulties  enlisting  the  energies  of 

everyone in the face of common threat. 

Both  instrumental  lines of argument are  important.  Indeed  they provide a 

case  for worrying about  inequality even  if you are a choice-based  libertarian 

who,  like Friedman,  thinks  that  it  is permissible  for government  to act  in ways 

1  For  discussion,  see  Philippe  Aghion,  Growth,  Inequality,  and  Globalization,  pp.  11-33. 

Justice,  Fall  2003—3 

that promote  the general welfare:  if  it  is permissible  to  for  regulate choice  for 

the  general welfare,  then  it  is  permissible  to  do when  such  regulation has  the 

effect of  reducing  inequality. Of  course assessing both  the general welfare 

argument  and  the  democracy  argument  is  a  complex  empirical matter. 

I mention  them here,  though, not  to provide  that assessment but  to 

distinguish  them  from  the  philosophical  egalitarianism  that we will be  exploring 

over  the next  few weeks. According  to  the philosophical egalitarian, certain 

kinds  of  inequalities may  be  indefensible not  simply  because  they  have  bad 

effects on democracy or  the general welfare, but because on more  intrinsic 

grounds: because  they are unjust. 

In particular,  the  liberal  egalitarianisms  proposed  by  Rawls  and  Dworkin 

say  that  the basic  requirement of  justice  is  that  the members of society are  to 

be  treated as  free and equal.  In a society of equals—what Tocqueville called a 

“democratic society”—in which  law and policy substantially effects  the  life 

chances  of members of  society,  inequalities of  opportunity and  outcome  create 

the  suspicion  that  the members  are  not  being  treated  as  equals. As Dworkin 

says:  “The distribution of  resources  that any society achieves  is a  function of  its 

laws and policies—not  just  its property and  tax  laws, but  the  full, complex  legal 

structure  that  its citizens and officials enact and enforce.  If  the  laws were 

different  in even minor  respects,  the distribution of wealth would  in 

consequence be  different. Under any  structure of  laws we  can  imagine,  some 

citizens  face bleaker prospects  for  their entire  lives—or at  least  less glowing 

prospects—than other citizens, and a society of equals must be  ready  to 

Justice,  Fall  2003—4 

explain,  to  those whose prospects are worse, why  it has not chosen a different 

arrangement  under which  their  prospects would  be  better.”2 

Such explanation may be available, and Rawls and Dworkin offer 

different versions of  it. The point  I wish  to emphasize here  is  that  the criticism 

on  grounds  of  justice—on  grounds  that  the  inequalities  in  life  circumstances  in 

some way  fail  to  show  “fairness  to  individuals”—is a  distinctive  line of 

argument, and  that  the basis of  the argument  is  the view  that  the members of a 

society are  to be  treated as  free and equal persons.  If Rawls and Dworkin are 

right,  that  very  abstract  principle  has  substantial  implications  for  economic 

justice, and  it may have  larger  implications as well:  for political equality, and  for 

how  to  think about gender and racial equality. 

2. Two Principles of Justice 


John Rawls’s A Theory of  Justice presents a  theory  called  “justice as  fairness.”


That  theory comprises  two principles of  justice, which are  to guide citizens’ 


judgments  about  their  constitution,  laws,  and  basic  social  policies.


�  The  first principle—the principle of equal basic  liberties—says  that 

each citizen has an equal  right  to  the most extensive system of equal basic 

personal  and  political  liberties  compatible  with  a  similar  system  of  liberties  for 

others. Whereas  the  choice-based  libertarian  endorses  a  basic  right  to  liberty 

as  such, Rawls’  principle of  liberty  requires  stringent  protections  for  certain 

specific  liberties—of  thought  and  conscience;  political  liberties  (rights  of 

2 Phil  and  Public  Affairs,  forthcoming. 

Justice,  Fall  2003—5 

participation);  liberty of association;  liberty and  integrity of  the person; and rights 

and  liberties  associated with  the  rule  of  law. His  first  principle  also  includes  a 

strong  requirement of political equality. Political  liberty  is  to be assured a  fair 

value: chances  to hold office and  to exercise political  influence ought  to be 

independent  of  socio-economic  position,  that  people who  are  equally motivated 

and equally able ought  to have equal chance  for political  influence. This 

principle has  large  implications  for  the way we  finance  elections: we will  come 

return  to  this  issue. 

À  Rawls  says  that  his  principles  “express  an  egalitarian  conception  of 

justice.”1  Thus  his  second  principle  of  justice  states  that  socio-economic 

inequalities  are  permissible  only  if  they  satisfy  two  conditions. First,  legitimate 

inequalities must  attach  to  offices  and  positions  open  to  all  under  conditions  of 

fair equality of opportunity. Here we have  the strong requirement of starting-

gate equality:  thus, people who are equally  talented and motivated must have 

equal  chances  to  attain  desirable  positions;  a  person’s  fate  in  life  should  not 

depend  on  the  social  circumstances  of  their  birth  and  upbringing. 

Second,  the  difference  principle  states  that  socio-economic  inequalities 

must be  to  the greatest benefit of  the  least advantaged members of society. 

Assume  that a  society guarantees equal basic  liberties and  fair equality of 

opportunity. Still,  it may  show  considerable  inequalities.  In  particular,  suppose 

some  people  have  highly marketable  skills  based  on  relatively  scarce  natural 

talents,  and  that  others  lack  similarly  high-end marketable  skills.  Assume 

people  in both groups work hard, and contribute. Nevertheless,  they  receive 

Justice,  Fall  2003—6 

substantially different  rewards  in  the  labor market,  and  those  differences will 

have a large impact on what they aspire to, and on the extent to which they can 

achieve  those aspirations. How,  in a society dedicated  to  the proposition  that 

we all are created equal, can such  inequalities,  founded as  they are on  the 

contingencies of  natural  talent,  be  acceptable? 

The answer provided by  the difference principle  is  that  the  inequalities 

are acceptable only  if  they aim  to mitigate  inequalities owing  to differences  in 

natural talent. When the difference principle is  in effect, everyone—and in 

particular  the  least advantaged group—shares  in  the benefits  that  flow  from  the 

diversity of  talents  in  the population.  "The difference principle  represents,  in 

effect, an agreement  to  regard  the distribution of natural  talents as  in some 

respects  a  common  asset  and  to  share  in  the  greater  social  and  economic 

benefits made possible by  the  complementarities of  this distribution.  .  .  . The 

naturally advantaged are not to gain merely because they are more gifted, but 

only  to cover  the costs of  training and education and  for using  their 

endowments  in ways  that  help  the  less  fortunate as well."2 

The  difference principle  treats  the  distribution of  talents  as  a  common 

asset  in  that  it seeks  to ensure that  the variety of  talents distributed  in  the 

population are used  in ways  that benefit all, and  in particular benefit  the  least 

well-off.  It does not mandate  the use of one's  talents  in  the socially most 

beneficial way. But  it does state that people can  legitimately expect greater 

rewards  from  the use of  their  talents and abilities only  if  the use benefits  the 

least well-off. The point of  the difference principle  is not  to  rail against  the 

Justice,  Fall  2003—7 

inequalities  of  natural  endowments,  or  to  eliminate  them.  Putting  aside 

speculations  about  genetic modifications,  that  there  are  such  differences  is 

presumably a matter of natural  fact. The question of political morality  is what  to 

do with such differences, given  their potentially  large consequences  for  the  fate 

of morally  equal  persons.3  The  right  response  to  these  human  differences 

between  and  among  people  is  not  to  eliminate  them:  human  differences  are 

often of great value and make our activities complementary. The point  is  to 

ensure  that  our  institutions enable  people  to  benefit  from  these  differences,  in 

terms of social primary goods, only  in ways  that ensure  fair  treatment  for all. 

In proposing  the difference principle, Rawls urges,  in effect,  that we 

reject  the  idea  that our economy  is a  talent contest, designed  to discover and 

reward  those  the gifted.  Instead,  it  is one part of a  fair scheme of cooperation, 

designed  to  ensure  a  reasonable  life  for  all members,  understood  as  free  and 

equals  persons:  "In  justice  as  fairness," Rawls  says,  "men  agree  to  share  one 

another's  fate.  In designing  institutions  they undertake  to avail  themselves of 

the accidents of  nature and  social  circumstance only  when doing so  is  for  the 

common  benefit." 

Ã  Rawls’s  two  principles of  justice  are  an  alternative  to  utilitarianism and 

libertarianism. An  alternative  to  utilitarianism, because  the  right  to  equal  basic 

liberties and distributive  fairness  take priority over maximizing general welfare. 

Particularly because of  this emphasis on  the priority of  liberty, Rawls’s  justice 

as  fairness  is squarely  in  the  liberal tradition of political thought. But  they also 

are  an  alternative  to  libertarianism,  because  justice  does  not  require  stringent 

protection  for  liberty as  such, but  for basic  liberties; and because  justice 

requires—in  the  second  principle—regulation of  choice  in  the  name  of  equality. 

Justice,  Fall  2003—8 

2. What, more exactly, do the principles say?

Three comments on  the  content of  the principles. 

�  First,  I said  that  the protections of  the basic  liberties are especially 

stringent: Rawls’s  equal  basic  liberty  principle  has  priority over  the  second 

principle. So Rawls may  seem  to be endorsing a  libertarian view. But his  first 

principle  is about specific  liberties, not  liberty or  choices as  such.  In particular, 

the market  liberties that were the concern of the Lochner Court are not covered 

by his  first principle of  justice. So  those  liberties can be  regulated  to achieve  the 

aims  of  the  second  principle  of  justice. 

So what does the “priority of liberty” come to, then? It means that 

justifications  for  limiting  a  basic  liberty must  show  how  the  proposed  limit 

improves the protection of  the basic  liberties overall. For example, to protect  the 

religious  liberty  of  religious minorities, we might  restrict  the  scope  of majority 

rule by adopting a constitutional right  to  liberty of conscience  that ensures  the 

free exercise of  religion:  this plausibly counts as a  restriction of political  liberty, 

inasmuch as  it  limits  the scope of  that  liberty. So one basic  liberty  (political 

liberty)  is  restricted  to ensure another basic  liberty  (religious  liberty). But—and 

this  is  the  force of  the priority of  liberty—it  is not similarly permissible  to  restrict 

political  liberty  in order  to  improve  the economic conditions of  the  least 

Justice,  Fall  2003—9 

advantaged:  for example,  it  is not permissible to  restrict  the voting rights of  the 

better off  in order  to  improve  the economic circumstances of  the  less well-off. 

À  Second,  the  difference  principle  says  that  inequalities  are  permissible 

only  if  they maximally benefit the  least advantaged. To understand how  this 

works,  it  is essential  to keep  in mind  that we are not assuming a  fixed 

economic  pie:  so  if  inequalities  foster  economic  growth,  the  results  can make 

everyone better off. Thus  consider  two  cases:  compensation and  incentives. 

Someone might  legitimately  be  paid more  than  someone  else  because  the 

higher  income  compensates  for expensive  training and education  that enable 

the  person  to  take  on  socially  desirable  tasks;  or  inequalities might make 

sense as  incentives  encouraging  people  to  take  on  tasks  they would  otherwise 

be unable or simply unwilling  to  take on. According  to  the difference principle 

such  inequalities may be perfectly  just, but  they must be no greater  than 

necessary  to maximally benefit  the  least  advantaged:  thus  if  someone  needs 

an incentive to take on a job that is socially beneficial, the incentive is perfectly 

just, provided that  it  is no  larger than necessary to get the person to do the  job. 

The ordinary workings of  labor markets are not  likely  to satisfy  this principle, 

because  those workings  reward people with  scarce  talents. So  tax  rates and 

income  transfers must  be  adjusted with  the  aim  of  ensuring  that  any  increase 

in  tax  rates,  for example, would worsen  the conditions of  the  least advantaged 

and  any  decrease would do  so  as well. 

�  Putting  the  two principles  together,  the  large ambition of  justice as 

fairness  is  to effect a "reconciliation of  liberty and equality." Instead of pitting 

Justice,  Fall  2003—10 

these  values  against  one  another,  justice  as  fairness  aims  to  accommodate 

elements  of  both  liberal  and  egalitarian  political  thought. 

Consider  how  the  two  principles work  in  combination. Assume  first  that 

what matters to people  is not only to have  legally protected  liberties, but for 

those  liberties be  valuable:  for  them  to  be worth  something. Assume,  second, 

that  the value of a person’s  liberty  is  importantly determined by  the  resources 

available  to  that person  for using  the  liberty.  In particular, assume  that  the worth 

or value of my  liberties  to me  is an  increasing  function of  the  resources over 

which  I exercise control: as my  command of  resources  increases,  I  can do 

more with my  liberties. 

Now put  the  two  principles  together:  the  first  ensures equal basic 

liberties;  the  second  guarantees  that  the minimum  level  of  resources  is 

maximized. If  the worth of a person's  liberty—its value  to  the person—is an 

increasing  function of  the  level of her resources,  then by maximizing  the 

minimum  level  of  resources, we  also maximize  the minimum worth  of  liberty. 

Thus  the  two principles together require that society "maximize the worth  to  the 

least advantaged of  the complete scheme of equal  liberty shared by all." 

Maximizing  the minimum worth of  liberty "defines," Rawls says, "the end of 

social  justice." 

3. What are the arguments for the two principles?

�  Rawls's main argument  for  the  two principles of  justice  is  based on 

the  idea of a social contract:  the  two principles would, he argues, be agreed  to 

Justice,  Fall  2003—11 

in an  initial contract among  the members of a society about  the principles  to 

guide  their society. But Rawls also offers another, more  informal argument  for 

the second principle. And  I want  first  to consider  that  informal argument, which 

we find in secs. 12-13 of Theory of Justice. 

À  Both arguments driven by  the  fundamental  idea  in  justice as  fairness: 

the  idea  that  justice  requires  that we  treat  individuals with  respect as  free and 

equal persons, and  that  such  treatment  requires  that  society mitigate  the 

effects on people’s  lives of  the  “arbitrariness of natural  contingency and  social 

fortune." The problem  is  to connect  this abstract  idea of  treating people as  free 

and  as  equals—the  ideal of  a  fair  society, whose members are  free  and 

equal—with  specific principles of  justice. Earlier  in  the  course,  I  called  this 

“Lincoln’s problem”: what  is  it  for a society  to be conceived  in  liberty and also 

dedicated  to  the proposition  that we are created equal. The contract argument 

and  the  informal argument represent  two ways  to bring out  the content of  this 

ideal of a  fair society:  two ways  to address Lincoln’s problem. But  they develop 

this  idea  in different ways. 

À  In  the  informal argument, we start from the broad principle that  if  there 

are  socio-economic  inequalities  they  should  be  attached  to  positions  "open  to 

all"  (equality of opportunity), and should serve  the  "common advantage.” How 

should  we  interpret  this  principle?  Rawls  considers  three  conceptions  of 

justice  that offer different  interpretations of  the  two notions  in  the principle: 

"open  to all" and  "common advantage." He  calls  those  interpretations  the 

“system of natural  liberty,” “liberal equality,” and “democratic equality.” The  idea 

Justice,  Fall  2003—12 

of  the  informal argument  is  to argue  that democratic equality provides  the best 

interpretation of  the broad principle. bring us  to  the  idea of democratic equality 

by examining certain difficulties in the other two: basically, from a very formal 

understanding of equal opportunity  to a more demanding  idea of equality.  (As 

you will see,  the  three systems correspond  to  the  ideas of  the capitalist ethic, 

starting gate equality, and democratic equality that I alluded to at the end of the 

discussion  of  Friedman's  libertarianism.) 

4. Why not natural liberty (NL)?

�  Consider  first,  then,  the system of natural  liberty—a Friedman-esque 

libertarian view. Think of  this view as defining a  just distribution. Thus a 

distribution of  resources  is  just  if and only  if  it  results  from a  social  system with 

° The equal basic  liberties  required by  the  first principle of  justice, 

°  “Formal equality of opportunity": positions are open  to all  in  the sense 

that  there  are  no  legal  obstacles  to  attaining  those  positions; and 

° An economy  that operates  for  the common advantage (or general 

welfare)  in  that  it works efficiently: no change  in  the  institutions could 

make  some people better off without making others worse off. 

Suppose  these  three  conditions  are met. Many  possible  distributions  of 

income  and  wealth  could  emerge;  some  will  be  more  equal,  some  much  less 

equal. According  to  the natural  liberty conception, whichever distribution  results 

from  the  choices  people make  under  conditions  that meet  the  conditions  noted 

earlier  is  just. 

Justice,  Fall  2003—13 

À The  fundamental  idea of natural  liberty  is  that  if a society ensures 

liberties  and  equal  opportunity,  then  the  distribution  of  resources will  depend 

on  people’s  choices—not  artificial  limits  imposed  by  government.  The 

distribution  is  just  because  it  reflects  these  choices.  Because  the  society 

protects  freedom of  individual choice,  the  result  is  just. 

Ã The natural  liberty view rejects any  requirement of ensuring more 

substantial  equality  among  citizens. So  inequalities may well  reflect  inheritance 

and  natural  talent,  as well  as  preference  and  aspiration,  and  simple  good  luck. 

Put otherwise, under natural  liberty,  the  final distribution  results  from 

individuals  decisions  about  production,  exchange,  and  consumption;  but  those 

decisions  are made  from  very  different  initial  starting  positions:  different  social 

positions, different native endowments, and different motivations  that develop 

in  light  of  that  position  and  those  endowments. 

Õ Why might someone object  to  this  ideal? Recall our discussion of why 

we might  reject a  feudal system, which  lacks  formal equality of opportunity,  in 

favor of natural  liberty. The most plausible  rationale  is  that opportunities should 

not be determined simply by social background, as  they would be  in a  feudal 

system with  legal obstacles on citizens  in virtue of  their social class.  If citizens 

fare differently in their  lives, we want those differences to have a rationale—that 

they not be arbitrary. And the fact that they reflect differences in social 

class—rather  than  qualifications  for  positions, or  choices  they make  in  light  of 

their values—does not provide a  rationale. 

Justice,  Fall  2003—14 

But  this  rationale  implies  that  eliminating  legal  barriers  to  opportunity  is 

insufficient.  For  a  person's  social  background  can  obstruct  his/her 

opportunities, even  if positions are,  formally speaking, open  to all. Suppose,  for 

example,  that  those positions—doctor, engineer,  lawyer,  teacher—have high 

training costs. Suppose,  too,  that  the ability  to bear  those costs depends on 

one's social background  (e.g., parental  income). Then,  if we hope  to  free  life 

chances  from class background,  the  system of natural  liberty  is  inadequate.  It 

aims only  to eliminate  legal barriers  to opportunity, even  though  the  reason  for 

condemning  those  barriers  carries  over  to  the  social  obstacles  as well. So  it  is 

an  unstable alternative  to  feudalism and  liberal equality. 

One additional point: I said earlier that a virtue of the system of natural 

liberty  is  that  it eliminates  legal obstacles  to social mobility. But  is  that  really 

so? The  legal  system enforces property  rights arising,  for example,  from 

inheritance. So  initial  inequalities—the  fact  that  Jones  is  less  advantaged at 

birth  than Smith—are  in part a consequence of  the  legal system;  they are not 

simply a product of private choices  that exist apart  from  law. Suppose  the  legal 

system were different; suppose,  for example,  that  there were no  right  to 

transmit  resources  to  one's  children;  or  suppose,  as  in  the  case  of  school 

financing, states did not  rely on  local property  taxes. Then  initial  inequalities 

would  be  less  important  in  determining  life  chances. So  the  law  is  implicated  in 

the  initial  inequalities,  and  in  this  sense  legal  barriers  remain  in  the  system  of 

natural liberty. 

Justice,  Fall  2003—15 

6. Why not Liberal Equality (LE)?

�  LE aims  to mitigate  the dependence of  life chances on  social 

background by adding a condition of  fair equality of opportunity: People who are 

equally endowed and equally motivated ought  to have equal chances of 

attaining desirable positions and offices.  In short,  “The expectations of  those 

with  the  same  abilities  and  aspirations  should  not  be  affected  by  their  social 

class”  (63). 

À We get to liberal equality by shifting the interpretation of the idea that 

positions must be  “open  to all”  from  formal equality of opportunity  to  the more 

substantive Fair Equality condition. According to  liberal equality, then, a 

distribution  is  just  if and only  if  it  results  from actions undertaken within a  social 

system  whose  basic  structure  meets  four  conditions:  equal  basic  liberties; 

formal equality of opportunity; fair equality of opportunity; the economy operates 

for  the  common advantage,  in  the  same  sense  as  earlier. So when  the  liberties 

and  fair equality are ensured,  then any distribution  that emerges  reflects  the 

choices  people make  and  so  is  a  just  distribution—regardless  of  the 

dispersion  in  the distribution. We have a strong condition of equal opportunity, 

but  no  constraints  on  inequalities  of  outcome. 

Ã  I want to emphasize that the defender of liberal equality may see fair 

equality as required for  liberty, not as hostile to  it. The thought is that freeing 

individuals  from  legal  and  social  constraints  on  developing  capacities  and 

realizing natural  talents  requires equality  of  initial  conditions. Similarly, 

achieving equal opportunity should not  in any way diminish human diversity: 

Justice,  Fall  2003—16 

why  should  ensuring  opportunity  for  each  person,  regardless  of  social  class, 

lead  to greater homogeneity, rather  than greater diversity of values, aspirations, 

and  achievements? 

Õ But  liberal equality itself may still be troubling, and  in two ways. First, 

people's  aspirations,  motivations,  and  realized  abilities  are  plausibly  shaped 

by social background and upbringing:  "Even  the willingness  to make an effort, 

to  try, and so  to be deserving  in  the ordinary sense  is  itself dependent upon 

happy  family  and  social  circumstances"  (74). Not  deterministically  dependent, 

to be sure, but dependent all  the same. But  if  that  is  true we will be dissatisfied 

with the system of liberal equality. Why? 

Liberal  equality  seeks  to  prevent  social  background  from  determining  life 

chances: that’s why  it  is preferable to natural liberty. But  it allows that  life 

chances may  reflect  aspirations, motivations,  and  realized  abilities. But 

suppose  our  aspirations  and  abilities—how much  effort  we  put  in—are 

influenced by social background.  If so,  then Fair Equality  itself permits social 

background  indirectly  to  determine  life  chances. While people with  equal 

abilities  and motivations  have  equal  chances,  people  born  into  different  social 

classes develop different abilities and make different efforts. Then  the  fact  that 

there  is  fair equality does not end  the dependence of social advantage on 

social  background.  It  simply  changes  the  mechanism  through  which  social 

background  shapes  life  chances. 

Second,  in  conditions of  liberal equality  "social  inequalities exactly 

express  natural  inequalities."4  But  if social background should not  fix  life 

Justice,  Fall  2003—17 

chances,  then why  is  it permissible  for  them  to be determined by differences  in 

natural endowment or  fortune? Here we have Friedman's objection  to  starting 

gate equality: If we are troubled by the fact that differences in life chances reflect 

differences of  social background,  then we  also have  reason  for being  troubled 

if  they are determined by differences  in natural endowment or fortune over the 

course of one's  life.  “There  is no more  reason  to permit  the distribution of 

income and wealth  to be settled by  the distribution of natural assets  than by 

historical  and  social  fortune”  (74). 

7. Why Democratic Equality (DE)?

�  Like Friedman, Rawls points  to  the  intellectual  instability  in  liberal 

equality. But Rawls proposes  to  resolve  that  instability by defending a more 

egalitarian conception of  justice, which he  calls democratic  equality. The 

central  idea is  to sever  life chances—in particular, our position  in  the 

distribution  of  income  and  wealth—from  social  starting  position,  natural 

endowments, and  luck. The  idea  is  to carry  through on  the  idea of making 

outcomes  depend  on  the  decisions  people make  about  to  do with  their  lives, 

rather  than  the resources or  talents  that we happen  to be born with—by 

establishing  greater  equality  of  circumstance. 

À  The democratic conception  results  from adding  the difference 

principle  to equal basic  liberties, efficiency, and  fair equality of opportunity. Thus 

a distribution  is  just  if and only  if  it  results  from a  system with basic  liberties 

and  fair equality of opportunity and  in which  inequalities can  reasonably be 

Justice,  Fall  2003—18 

expected  to contribute  to  the maximum well-being of  the  least well-off. The 

difference principle does  not  itself  place  any  direct  restrictions on  income 

dispersion: on  the distance between  top and bottom,  for example. But  it does 

require  that  improvements at  the  top  be  tied  to  improvements elsewhere—in 

particular,  to  the maximum  improvements at  the bottom. 

Ã How might we get  to  this seemingly extreme  requirement—extreme  in 

attaching so much weight  to  the size of  the minimum? Start with  the  idea  that 

the distribution of economic advantage  is not a product of nature, or simply of 

the separate choices of  individuals, but at  least  in part a  result of  the  rules of 

the economic game  that we collectively choose  to adopt and enforce: a product 

in part of what Rawls calls  the “basic structure of society.” Suppose,  too  that we 

think  that  those  rules—which we collectively choose  to adopt and 

enforce—ought to be  founded on  the  idea  that people are  to be  treated as 

equals,  irrespective of  the  reflect  the decisions  that people make about  their 

lives, and ought  to be severed  from  the contingent differences  that distinguish 

among  equal moral  persons. But  to  see  us  as  free  and  equal  persons  is  to 

see  us  in  abstraction  from  all  the  features  that  distinguish  us—all  the 

contingencies of social  fortune and  luck  in  the natural  lottery. This naturally 

suggests an equal distribution of  income and wealth. For  if we  regard all  the 

sources of differences  in  fate as morally arbitrary, and  then strive  to eliminate 

the effects of  the morally arbitrary on  the distribution of  resources,  the  result  is 

equality of outcome, and not simply equality of opportunity. 

Justice,  Fall  2003—19 

But  now  suppose  an  unequal  distribution—by  providing  incentives  or 

compensation—would  increase  the  size  of  the  pie,  and  so  could  improve  the 

circumstances of all. So  the  inequalities could work  to  the advantage of all: 

permitting  such  inequalities,  then,  can  itself  be  interpreted  as  a  consequence 

of an equal concern  for  the good of each. This brings us  to  the second stage: 

what sorts of departures  from equality are consistent with  the  idea of 

separating  life  chances  from  the  contingencies  of  social  and  natural  fortune. 

How are the gains that result when we move away from equality to be 

d istr ibuted? 

According  to  the  difference principle,  the  justification  for  some positions 

being more  favored  than others —e.g.,  for giving  rewards  to  those whose 

natural abilities enable  them  to contribute more—is  that by  favoring  them, 

benefits  to  those  in  less  advantaged positions will be maximized. This  is  a way 

to gain  the advantages  to all  that  can  result  from  inequalities while mitigating 

the effects on people's  lives of  the  contingencies of  social background, natural 

endowment, and good  luck.  It mitigates  in precisely  the  following way:  that no 

one  is permitted  to  take advantage of his/her social position or natural 

endowments  except  and  insofar  as  their  doing  so  improves  the  conditions  of 

the  least advantaged. So  the  fact  that someone  is  in  the  least advantaged 

group—because  of  the  social  background,  or  native  endowments—has  less 

effect on his/her material conditions  than under alternative distributive 

pr inc ip les. 

Justice,  Fall  2003—20 

Õ But while  the  informal argument has some  force,  it  is not clear why  the 

two principles, and maximizing  the minimum  in particular, are  the best way  to 

express  the  idea of  treating people as  free and equal moral persons. Offhand, 

an  equal  distribution  also  satisfies  that  condition,  as would  a  distribution  that 

ensures  a  decent minimum without maximizing  the minimum.  In  short,  it  is  not 

clear  from  the  informal argument  that  there are any determinate principles  that 

express  the  ideal of a distribution of  rights, duties, and advantages  that nullifies 

or mitigates  the  contingencies  of  natural  fortune,  social  circumstance,  and 

simple good  luck. This,  then,  is  the  role of  the more  formal argument  for 

principles  from  the  original  position. 

8. Why a social contract?

I have suggested  that Rawls’s basic concern might be put  this way: What  is  the 

most  reasonable  conception of  justice  for  a  society  of  free  and  equal  persons? 

What principles should our society meet,  if  it  is  to be  fair  to persons conceived 

of as  free and equal?  In particular, should  it be utilitarian,  libertarian, a  less 

liberal  egalitarian  society,  a  less  egalitarian  liberal  society? 

�  Rawls’s  answer  revives  the  social  contract  idea  associated with 

Locke, Rousseau, and Kant. The social contract  tradition argues  that  the  right 

way  to order a society  is  the ordering that  the members of  the society would 

unanimously  agree  to. Because of  the  requirement of unanimity, each person 

has veto power over  the  terms of  the agreement, so  the  terms of  the agreement 

Justice,  Fall  2003—21 

must be  justified  to each person. And as Hobbes said:  “that which every man 

will have so, no man can say  is unjust.” 

À  The  idea of a unanimous  initial agreement has an obvious attraction 

for a society of equals. But at the same time, a basic fact of social  life  is that 

people  disagree  about  issues  of morality,  politics,  and  religion. How  could 

there ever be unanimous agreement?  If  there  is  to be agreement, we need  to 

impose  some  special  conditions  on  the  agreement. We  cannot  simply  take  a 

vote:  that will simply  reveal  the points of disagreement, not generate a 

unanimous  agreement. At  the  same  time,  not  just  any  conditions  designed  to 

generate agreement will  do. We might  be  able  to  get  a  unanimous agreement 

if we  injected everyone with a drug  that  induces head-nodding and  thus 

secures agreement, but  that would not  justify  the  results. 

Ã How then can we navigate between voting and drugging? One thought 

is  that  people  who  disagree  about  what  justice  demands  nevertheless  agree, 

or might be brought on  reflection  to agree, on  certain  fundamentals. Suppose, 

then,  that we could use  these  fundamental points of agreement  to define  the 

circumstances  in which  people make  a  social  contract—to  set  acceptable 

conditions  on  the  circumstances  of  agreement.  Then  perhaps we  could  get 

unanimous  agreement  about  basic  principles  of  justice. 

Õ  Rawls  suggests  three  points  of  agreement: 

1. First,  that certain particular practices are unjust—e.g.,  religious 

intolerance  and  racial  discrimination. Convictions  about  the  injustice  of  these 

practices are, Rawls  says,  "provisional  fixed  points which we  presume any 

Justice,  Fall  2003—22 

conception of  justice must  fit." So  the  social  contract  condition  is designed  so 

that  the parties will agree on  these points, whatever else  they agree on.  It  is 

simply built  into  the situation  that  the  result has  to  fit  there “data points.” 

2. Second, about a "conception of the person." By a “conception of the 

person,” Rawls means a  view about  the  features of human beings  that are of 

fundamental  importance  and  relevance  about  when  it  comes  to  addressing 

questions  of  public  justice. For  the  utilitarian, what  is most  fundamental  is  our 

capacity  to experience pleasure and pain. For  justice as  fairness, what matters 

most when  it  comes  to  issues  of  justice  are  not  the  differences  among 

us—differences of  race and sex, social background, native  talents, and 

religious, moral,  and  personal  ideals.  These  differences,  as  important  as  they 

are  in  some  settings, we  should  regard, Rawls  says,  as  "accidents  of  natural 

endowment  and  contingencies  of  social  circumstance;"  such  accidents  are 

"arbitrary from a moral point of view." Instead, what is relevant is that we are 

free  and  equal moral  persons.  Let me  explain  this  important  idea: 

First,  individuals are assumed  to have a conception of  the good—a set 

of goals, attachments, and  loyalties, which serve  to guide  their conduct. 

Conceptions  of  the  good may  be more  individualistic or more  communal:  the 

essential point  is  that  individuals have  them and  they vary across people. 

Second, we have the capacity to form a conception of the good—that is, a 

capacity to decide on, to pursue, and to revise our conception of the good. We 

might undertake  such  revision  in  the  light on new  information, wider 

experience,  new  forms  of  self-understanding,  and moral  or  religious  reflection. 

Justice,  Fall  2003—23 

We are neither unconditionally committed to our current view of  the good, nor 

are we  simply a  bundle of  unrelated preferences and goals;  instead we have 

aims  and  aspirations, and  are  able  to  revise  them  on  reflection. 

Third, we have the capacity for a sense of justice, i.e. to grasp the 

principles specifying  fair  terms of  social  interaction and  to guide our  conduct  in 

light of  that understanding. 

These  common  potentialities—"moral  powers,"  in  Rawls's  term—define 

us as  free and equal moral persons. We are equal  in  that each has,  to a 

sufficient  degree,  these  basic  powers, which  enable  us  to  participate  as  full 

members of  the society. This  is not of course  to deny our many differences: of 

course we are very different from one another as well. But the point  is to affirm 

that  those  differences—of  talent  and  ambition,  religious and  gender,  race  and 

ethnicity—do not  touch  our  standing  as  equals;  for  that  status,  the  possession 

of  the moral  powers  is  sufficient. Moreover,  as  possessors  of  the  basic moral 

powers we are free. In particular, we have and are recognized as having the 

capacity  to  alter our goals, attachments, and  loyalties without  losing  standing 

as  citizens—for example,  to  undergo  religious  conversion or  change of  political 

commitment  without  loss  of  rights. 

3. Finally,  there  is agreement about an abstract  ideal of social 

cooperation—in particular, about  the  importance of  fairness  in  society. While 

people have different ends and goals, different backgrounds and  talents, we 

each ought  to have a  fair chance  to develop our  talents and  to pursue those 

goa ls .  

Justice,  Fall  2003—24 

Œ  People who  disagree  about  justice might  nevertheless  be  brought  on 

reflection  to  agree,  as  a  basis  of  political  argument,  on  these  basics. Rawls's 

idea  is  to  take  these points of agreement, and construct a conception of  justice 

around  them by building  the social contract  to  reflect  them. Though we now 

disagree, perhaps deeply, about what a  just society  is, we agree—or could be 

brought  to agree on  reflection—with the very abstract  idea  that  justice requires 

a  society  that  is  fair  to  its members  considered as  free and equal moral 

persons, a society whose basic structure works  to  "nullify  the accidents of 

natural  endowment  and  contingencies  of  social  circumstance  as  counters  in 

[the] quest  for political and economic advantage." The problem  is  to ensure  that 

the  initial contract  reflects  this  ideal. 

9. What is the Original Position (OP)?

So  the  task  is  to connect  the abstract  ideal of  fair cooperation among  free and 

equal  persons—each with  the  basic  powers  required  for  full  participation  in 

society—to  specific  requirements  of  justice. And Rawls  proposes  to  bridge  this 

gap  through  the social contract:  in particular, a contract built around  the points 

of  agreement. 

�  Rawls  asks  us  to  imagine  a  hypothetical  situation—the Original 

Position—in which  people  are  to  choose  principles of  justice  for  their  own 

society. That contract situation  is constructed so as  to  reflect  the  fundamental 

points of agreement,  in particular,  the conception of  the persons as  free and 

equal.  In particular,  the essential  idea of moral persons  is  that certain of our 

Justice,  Fall  2003—25 

characteristics are not  relevant  in deciding what we are entitled  to as a matter 

of  justice. To  represent  that  idea of  irrelevance, Rawls proposes  that we make 

the choice of principles behind a  "veil of  ignorance"  in which we are assumed  to 

be unaware of the irrelevant features. Behind the veil, we do not know, for 

example, whether or not we are blessed by natural chance, or whether  the 

contingencies  of  social  circumstance  are  favorable  or  unfavorable. 

In a slogan: model  irrelevance  by  ignorance.  In particular, we do a 

thought experiment. Imagine, hypothetically, that we are to make a choice of 

principles of  justice  for our society on  the assumption  that we, as  the parties 

making  the  choice, do not  know our  social  class position, natural  talents, sex or 

race, conception of  the good, or anything else  that distinguishes any one of us 

from  other  free  and  equal moral  persons.  Because  the  parties must  reason  as 

if they did not know these things, they will not be able to tailor principles to 

advantage  themselves, or members of  their  class,  sex,  race,  religion, or moral 

tradition. Not knowing these facts, people have a chance of arriving at a 

unanimous  agreement.  Though  conditions  like  the  veil  of  ignorance may  seem 

artificial,  the  idea  is  simply  “to make vivid  to ourselves  that  it  seems  reasonable 

to  impose  on  arguments  for  principles  of  justice,  and  therefore  on  those 

principles  themselves”  (16). 

Rawls  proposes,  then,  that  if  people  reason  about  issues  of  justice  as 

though  they were unaware of  the social contingencies and  the accidents of 

natural  endowment,  then  they would  chose  his  two  principles  of  justice—with 

their assurance of maximin worth of  liberty—over alternative conceptions. 

Justice,  Fall  2003—26 

À  Because  the aim of  the original position  is not simply  to  reach an 

agreement  (we can get  that with a head-nodding drug), but  to  find principles 

suited  to  the  ideal of  fair cooperation among  free and equal persons, we are  to 

place behind  the  veil of  ignorance all  the  features  that distinguish among  free 

and  equal  moral  persons—including  their  religious  ideas,  moral  philosophies, 

and views of social  justice. These  ideas are  important  to who we are, and  to 

how we conduct our  lives. But  they distinguish people, understood as  free and 

equal  citizens,  so we put  them aside. The parties  in  the original position  know 

only  that  they  represent  the  interests of a person who has some conception of 

the good, perhaps a  religious outlook  (though  they do not now what  that 

conception  is); a person who has an  interest  in be able  to  choose and  revise 

their ends; and who has an  interest  in  forming and acting on a  sense of  justice. 

Once they know that, however, they also know that advancing those 

basic  interests  requires  certain  goods—"social  primary  goods"—and  so  the 

parties  to  the social contract know  that  they need  these goods.  In particular, the 

social  primary  goods  are: 

i. The basic  liberties,  including  freedom of  thought and  conscience,  the 

political  liberties,  liberty of  association,  the  liberties associated with  the  integrity 

of  the person, and  the  liberties associated with  the  rule of  law. 

ii. Freedom of movement and  choice of occupation, under conditions  in 

which there are a variety of opportunities. 

iii. Powers  and  prerogatives of  office  and  positions  of  responsibility. 

iv. Income and wealth. 

Justice,  Fall  2003—27 

v. Social bases of  self-respect. 

Ã What  is  special about  these goods? Given  the  conditions of  social 

cooperation  among  human  beings,  free  and  equal  citizens  need  these  goods 

whatever their particular conception of the good may be. They need them 

because  these  goods  are  required  for  pursuing a wide  range of  ends,  and  for 

developing  and  exercising  the  potentialities  or  basic  “moral  powers”  that  define 

a moral person. Of  course, we need other goods as well, but  these  social 

primary goods  are more  directly dependent on  social  institutions  than  are  other 

primary  goods  (“health  and  vigor,  intelligence  and  imagination”). 

For example, consider  the basic  liberties. Liberty of  thought and 

conscience  is a primary good  in part because  it  is  required  for  the pursuit of  the 

various moral,  religious,  and  philosophical  conceptions  that  serve  to  support 

our conceptions of  the good:  in particular,  it  is required  if we are to  fulfill the 

obligations  that  our moral and  religious  views  (if we  have  them) assign  to  us. 

Or  in  the case of  income and wealth: we  typically need  resources  to pursue our 

aims  and  ambitions.  The  case  of  self-respect  is  especially  important,  and  I will 

come back to it later on. 

10. What is the intuitive idea behind the OP argument?

Under  the veil of  ignorance,  the parties base  their choice of principles on  the 

consequences of  those choices  for  their  level of primary goods. The central 

claim,  then,  is  that parties  in  the original position would prefer  their expected 

Justice,  Fall  2003—28 

level of primary goods under  the  two principles than under any of  the 

alternatives,  and  therefore would  choose  those  principles. 

�  The argument  itself  is complicated, so  it will help  to have  the  intuitive 

line of  thought  in mind: You are asked  to choose principles  that will  regulate  the 

society you  live  in. You will make  the choice under conditions of  ignorance 

about yourself, your  ideals, and your social position. Because you do not know 

which person you will be, but have to  live with the principles you choose, you 

want  to  be  sure—if  this  is  possible—that  your  situation  is  (roughly) acceptable 

whatever  it  turns out  to be. Because of  the veil of  ignorance, which models 

moral equality as ignorance of who you are, you want to be sure that the society 

is acceptable  from  the point of view of each person—because you may be  that 

person. In particular, you want to be sure that it will be acceptable even if you 

land  in  the  lowest social position, where  it  is  least  likely  to be acceptable. And, 

according  to  Rawls,  this  is  just  the  insurance—the  strong  downside 

protection—that  the  two principles provide:  they ensure  that social 

arrangements are  acceptable  to  all members  of  a  society  of  equals. 

À But why  focus so much on downside protection? To see  the  force of 

the  question,  consider  the  contrast  between Rawls'  two  principles  and  the 

principle of average utility. According to the principle of average utility, an action 

or  institution  is  right or ought  to obtain  just  in case  it maximizes  the sum of 

utility divided by the number of people, rather than just the sum of utility (with 

evident differences  for questions of population policy). 

Justice,  Fall  2003—29 

A society regulated by either democratic equality or average utility would 

include a  range of different  levels of primary goods, associated with different 

social  positions.  Let’s  focus  for  a moment  only  on  the  economic  implications  of 

the  principles.  Thus,  the minimum  income  under  the  two  principles  is  a 

maximized minimum;  it must  be  at  least  as  high  as  the minimum  level  in  a 

society  that aims not  to maximize  the minimum but  to maximize average utility. 

But because the average under AU  is a maximized average,  it must be at  least 

as high as  the average under  the  two principles; moreover,  the maximum  level 

may well be higher. That is, the average level of utility may well be greater if a 

society  permits  greater  dispersion  and  allows  inequalities  that  do  not 

contribute  to  the well-being of  the  least well-off group.5 

Here, then, is the question: From behind the VI,  is  it rational to take a 

chance with AU, or  to opt  for  the  two principles? Notice  two considerations that 

are important to the decision, and they work in different directions. If you opt for 

democratic equality, you buy strong protection against downside  risks:  in effect 

you buy  insurance against  luck, or  inheritance, or  talent not working out well, 

since  you  ensure  that  the minimum  is  as  high  as  possible.  But  insurance  has 

a cost:  if  things work out well, you may end up doing  less well  than you might 

otherwise have done—you pay  the premium but do not collect. How  then are 

parties in the OP to balance the high security level provided by the two 

principles  against  the  possible  gains  that  could  be won  by  choosing  average 

utility. 

Justice,  Fall  2003—30 

11. How does self-respect lead to the two principles?

So what  leads  the parties  in  the original position  to be  so  concerned about 

ensuring  the  highest  possible minimum?  The  rationale  has  a  great  deal  to  do 

with  the  stakes  of  the  choice, and one  consideration  that  brings  those  stakes 

out with particular  force  is Rawls’s account of self-respect. The point,  in 

essence,  is  that when we make our  choice  in  the original position, we need  to 

be very conservative  in part because a profoundly  important good  is at stake  in 

our decision, namely our self-respect.  In a nutshell, our chances of  living a 

good  life will  depend  on  achieving  self-respect,  our  achieving  self-respect will 

depend on how we are regarded and  treated by others  in our society, and how 

we are  regarded and  treated by others  in our society will be  represented  in  the 

principles of  justice  for  the society. 

�  What  is self-respect? According  to Rawls,  the basic elements of self-

respect  are:  (i)  that  the  person  has  reasonable  hopes  for  success  in  achieving 

those aims;  (ii)  that  a  person believes  that  his/her aims are worth achieving 

(440),  in part because others acknowledge  the worth of  those aims. But why  is 

self-respect  relevant  to  the  choice of principles? 

À That relevance reflects three  features of self-respect. 

The  first  is  that  self-respect  is  a  fundamental  good—perhaps  the 

fundamental  primary  good—whose  presence  is  almost  certainly  required  if 

conditions are  to be acceptable. Without self-respect, "All desire and activity 

becomes empty and vain, and we sink  into apathy and cynicism"  (440). The 

fundamental  importance  of  self-respect  suggests  the  following  test  for  the 

Justice,  Fall  2003—31 

acceptability of  each position under  the  two principles:  consider whether each 

position ensures  conditions  favorable  to  the  self-respect of  the  person  in  it. 

Now  it may  seem strange  to  treat self-respect as a  social primary good; 

after all, self-respect  is not something  that society has  to distribute  to people:  it 

is not  like  income, or wealth, or  liberties, or opportunties. But—here  I come  to 

the  second main  idea—while  self-respect  itself  is  not  socially  distributed, 

certain  social  conditions  that  support  self-respect  are:  Rawls  calls  these 

conditions  the  "social  bases"  of  self-respect,  by  which  he means  social 

conditions  that  foster  self-respect.  It  is  useful  to  distinguish  two  kinds  of  social 

bases,  corresponding  to  the  two  aspects  of  self-respect  I  distinguished  earlier: 

(i)  It  is  important  that  our  circumstances enable us  to  develop aspirations and 

to  pursue  them with  reasonable  prospects  of  success:  call  this  the  "objective 

side" of self-respect;  (ii)  It  is  important  that we associate with others  in such a 

way  that we experience  their  respect  for us; without such experience, our sense 

of our own worth and  that our aspirations are worth pursuing may be hard  to 

sustain. Call  this  the  "cultural  side"  of  self-respect. 

Third,  the  other  primary  goods  (other  than  self-respect)—basic  liberties, 

opportunities,  income  and wealth,  powers  and  positions  of  authority—provide 

social bases of self-respect, both objective and cultural. Later  I will explain  in 

more  detail  how  this  connection  between  primary  goods  and  social  bases 

works. Suffice  it to say  that the concern with self-respect  leads to a concern with 

the  social  bases  of  self-respect. And  the  concern with  social  bases,  both 

Justice,  Fall  2003—32 

objective and cultural,  leads  to a concern with  the distribution of  the other 

primary  goods  since  they  provide  those  social  bases. 

Ã So self-respect has very great value; and  it has social  foundations. To 

ensure  that  they have an acceptable situation,  then,  the parties  in  the original 

position need  to  ensure  that  social  conditions will  be  supportive of  their  self-

respect. Consider,  then, how a concern  for  the social  foundations of self-

respect  leads  to a case  for  the  two principles. 

Thus,  it counts  in favor of the two principles that they provide equal basic 

liberties,  basic  liberties  at  every  social  position  including  the minimum. Why? 

Because  the  liberties enable  citizens, whatever  their  social position,  to  form 

associations  with  others  in  which  common  ideals  can  be  pursued,  and  such 

common  pursuits  in  association  with  others  who  share  their  concerns  and 

ideals will help  to provide subjective support  for  their self-respect. By ensuring 

the  liberties  to  all,  then,  regardless of  their  social  position,  the  two  principles 

help  to  ensure  in  particular  that  the minimum  position  is  satisfactory  or 

acceptable because  they help  to establish  the  conditions of  self-respect at  that 

pos it ion. 

Œ  Considerations of  self-respect  also  give  the  parties  reason  for 

concern about  the material  resources available  to  them. They want  to ensure 

that  they can pursue  their aims with self-confidence:  the objective basis of self-

respect. But  for  that purpose they need more  than simply  the  liberty to pursue 

those aims. They need  to be sure  that  their  liberties are worth something,  that 

the  liberties are not  just  formally protected, but also genuinely valuable. So  they 

Justice,  Fall  2003—33 

want  to ensure what Rawls calls  the "worth of  liberty" (204): a decent standard 

of  living  that will enable  them  to use  their  liberties  in pursuit of  their aspirations, 

no matter what position they end up  in. 

But concern about a decent standard of  living—say, a  reasonable  floor 

under  income,  or  a  threshold—is  one  thing;  ensuring  that  the minimum  is 

maximized  is another. Why do considerations of self-respect  lead  to  the DP as 

a way to ensure that decent standard of  living? 

Consider  how  the  difference  principle  supports  self-respect  at  the  least 

advantaged  position. 

1. The difference principle only permits  inequalities  that contribute  to 

lifetime  expectations  at  the  least well-off  position.  Smaller  inequalities would 

reduce  expectations,  as  would  greater  inequalities. 

2. Assume now  that  the value or  "worth" of  liberties  to a person depends 

on  the  level  of  resources  available  to  the  person.  (This  is much  less  plausible 

for  the case of  the political  liberties. But  their worth  is ensured by  the proviso  in 

the  first principle requiring the  fair value of political  liberty.) 

3. Therefore,  the minimum value of  the  liberties with  the difference 

principle  is greater  than  the minimum value under  the alternatives.  Indeed,  if 

the  value of  the  liberties  is, as proposed, an  increasing  function of  (absolute, 

not  relative)  income and wealth,  then  the value of  the  liberties achieves  its 

maximin  when  the  difference  principle  is  satisfied. 

4. But self-respect depends on  the value of  the  liberties. For self-respect 

requires  confidence  in  one's  ability  to  successfully  pursue  one's  aims:  it 

Justice,  Fall  2003—34 

requires  objective  supports.  But  that  confidence  is  increased  as  resources 

increase.  In short,  then,  the great value of self-respect encourages  the choice 

of principles  that maximize  the minimum worth of  liberty. 

5. So  the  two principles  together provide strong  insurance  for  the social 

bases  of  self-respect,  even  at  the minimum  position. 

6. Therefore,  the  two principles provide strong  insurance of acceptability. 

Furthermore, under  the difference principle occupants of  the  least well-

off position are not only guaranteed  the worth of  the  liberties;  this guarantee  is 

part of a public understanding  in  the society. But with an acceptable minimum 

defined as  a maximized minimum,  the  society  in effect agrees  to  ensure 

advantages  regardless  of  the  particulars  of  social  position,  natural  endowment, 

and good  fortune  that  distinguish  the  free and equal members of  a well-

ordered  society.  To  forgo  possible  advantages  because  accepting  them would 

reduce expectations at  the minimum, and  the worth of  liberties at  the minimum, 

is  to express  respect  for  those at  the minimum position and  fully affirms  their 

worth. And  in view of the  importance of self-respect, it  is rational to want public 

institutions  to  show  respect  for  people. 

So  the choice of  the difference principle strengthens  the  foundations of 

self-respect  both  by  ensuring  the  resources  required  for  the  self-confident 

pursuit of aims  (the objective aspect of  the social bases of  self-respect) and by 

contributing  to  the experience of  respect  (the cultural aspect of  the social bases 

of self-respect).  It builds a  respect  for each member of  the society, as  free and 

equal,  into  the  basic  principles  regulating  the  society. 

Justice,  Fall  2003—35 

In effect, what Rawls has said  in  this argument  is  the  following:  in a 

modern political society,  the distribution of  income  is not natural and  fixed, or 

simply  the  result  of  separate  individual decisions.  Instead,  it  results  in  part  from 

our  collective  decisions,  about  the  rules  of  the  economic  game  concerning 

property, contract,  taxation, education,  training—our collective decisions about 

laws  and  policies.  Because  outcomes  are  dependent  on  the  rules we  adopt 

collectively—on  the basic structure of  the society—and not simply  the choices 

we make  individually,  the  stakes  in ensuring a  fair distribution of  income are 

very high:  in particular,  increasing material well-being  for citizens who are  least 

well-off  is not simply a matter of  increasing their welfare.  Instead,  it  is a way of 

providing a kind of social  recognition of equal worth, by ensuring  them  the 

resources  they need  to  formulate and  to pursue  their plans of  life on an equal 

footing.  Just  as we  show  respect  for members as  equals by  providing  rights  to 

personal  and  political  liberties—an  entitlement  to  pursue  personal  aims  and  to 

participate  as  equal members  of  the  sovereign  people  in  deciding  the  rules  of 

the  society—so  too  we  show  respect  for members  as  equals  by  establishing 

rules of  the economic game  that  foster a  fair distribution of  the  resources 

people need  to  pursue  their aspirations,  in particular by  ensuring  that we 

maximize the value of liberty to those for whom the value is lowest. Under any 

structure  of  laws we  can  imagine,  the  prospects  of  some  citizens will  be  less 

attractive for their entire lives than the prospects of other citizens. In a society of 

equals, we need  to be able  to explain,  to  those whose prospects are worse, 

why we have not chosen a different arrangement under which  their prospects 

would be  better. Under Rawls principles,  the explanation  is  that  the prospects 

for those who are worst off are as good as they can be.

12. Conclusions 

Rawls’s basic  contention  is  this: Start  from  the  fundamental  ideal of a  fair 

system  of  cooperation  among  free  and  equal moral  persons, who  have 

divergent moral  and  religious  convictions.  Consider  which  principles  of  justice 

are  suited  to  fair  cooperation  among  persons  thus  understood.  Beginning with 

that basic  ideal, we will want  to  find principles acceptable  to each person, 

whatever  his/her  social  position,  talents,  sex,  race,  religious  creed,  aspirations. 

Acceptability turns crucially on support for self-respect. And if we want to find 

such principles,  then we will arrive at  the  two principles,  those principles having 

the property that would be acceptable even if we turned out to be the least 

advantaged. 

Starting  from  the  fundamental  ideal of  fair cooperation among  free and 

equal moral  persons, we will  be  led  to  a  political  conception mandating  both 

security  of  basic  liberties and  socio-economic equality:  a  "reconciliation of 

liberty and equality." What this suggests is that we ought not to think of liberty 

and  equality  as  independent  values  that  need  to  be  balanced much  less  as 

warring principles, nor  should we  suppose  that  the  combination of  the  two  into 

a  single  conception  of  justice  is  simply  a matter  of  political  compromise. 

Instead,  liberty and equality have a common  foundation  in  the  ideal of a society 

that  recognizes  its members as  free  and  equal, and  provides  fair  conditions of 

Justice,  Fall  2003—37 

cooperation  among  them.  That  ideal  both  supports  such  fundamental 

convictions  as  that  religious  intolerance  and  racial  discrimination  are  unjust 

and  at  the  same  time  provides  egalitarian  guidance  on  controversial  questions 

about  the  distribution  of  social  and  economic  resources.

3  “The  natural  distribution  is  neither  just  nor  unjust;  nor  is  it  unjust  that  persons  are  born  into  society 
at  some  particular  position.  These  are  simply  natural  facts. What  is  just  and  unjust  is  the way  that 
institutions  deal  with  these  facts.  Aristocratic  and  caste  societies  are  unjust  because  they  make  these 
contingencies  the  ascriptive  basis  for  belonging  to  more  or  less  enclosed  and  privileged  social 
classes.  The  basic  structure  of  these  societies  incorporates  the  arbitrariness  found  in  nature.  But 
there  is  no  necessity  for men  to  resign  themselves  to  these  contingencies”  (87-88).

5  This  is  a  rough  approximation  to  the  difference:  it  needs  to  be  adjusted  for  the  fact  that  the 
two  principles  specify  a  distribution  of  primary  goods, while  average  utility  operates  in  utility 
space .
