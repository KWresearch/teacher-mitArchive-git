The Importance of Philosophy: Reflections on John Rawls 

Joshua Cohen 

In spring 1974, I was 22 years old, and a first-year graduate student in the 

Harvard Philosophy department. One of my courses that term was a seminar on 

Kant’s moral philosophy with John Rawls. The class met on Wednesdays. And 

one Wednesday evening, after returning home from a meeting of the seminar, I 

had a phone call from Jack (everyone called him Jack). He was calling, he said, 

because he was concerned about how the seminar had gone that day. I don’t 

recall the precise words, but knowing Jack, I am sure that he did not ask whether 

it had gone well: he would have said something like “I hope it seemed OK to 

you.” 

I told him that it had indeed gone fine: of course, I thought the class was 

great, but didn’t want to embarrass him by saying that. 

I was pleased to get the call. When you are 22, it is nice to have your 

judgment taken that seriously by someone you hold in the highest regard. But 

Jack didn’t call to be pleasing or affirming. He called because he really wanted to 

know whether the seminar had been okay: at least I think that’s why he called. 

He seemed genuinely worried about whether he had been understood. I was a 

little taken aback by his concern. But that intense worry was entirely 

characteristic: so it eventually seemed to me, over the years, and from observing 

him in a wide range of settings with lots of different people. 

I believe that John Rawls’s deep concerns about being understood owed 

ultimately to his sense of the profound importance of his subject-matter. Not the 

importance of his own contribution—though for all his famous modesty, he knew 

he had done something pretty significant, and taught A Theory of Justice in his 

political philosophy course, along with Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, and Mill. 

But the concern was driven, instead, by a profound sense of responsibility to his 

topic. And that topic was morality—personal morality on that Wednesday in 1974, 

political morality in much of his published work. It was as if he felt that there was 

nothing worse than failing to do justice to this subject-matter—or even if wasn’t 

the worst thing, it was really bad. 

And why was it so important? The best way to answer to that question is 

to sketch the principal ideas in Rawls’s work. 

In A Theory of Justice (1971, 1999), John Rawls proposed a striking and 

original marriage of liberty and equality, animated by a tolerant and democratic 

faith in human possibilities. For much of the past century, the idea of a political 

philosophy devoted to both liberty and equality seemed to many people a 

contradiction in terms. Outraged by vast differences between the lives of rich and 

poor, egalitarians condemned the classical liberalism of John Locke and Adam 

Smith for giving undue attention to legal rights and liberties, while remaining 

indifferent to the fate of ordinary people. Traditional liberalism, they complained, 

prized equality before the law, but showed complacency in the face of profound 

and grim inequalities of fortune on earth. 

Classical liberals, in contrast, embraced personal liberty, and condemned 

egalitarians for their paternalism and willingness to sacrifice human freedom in 

the name of some possible future utopia. Practically speaking, democratic 

welfare states tried, with more or less success, to ensure personal and political 

liberties while protecting individuals from unforgiving markets. But the 

philosophical options seemed starkly opposed. In between Friedrich von Hayek’s 

classical liberalism and Karl Marx’s egalitarianism, everything was an unstable 

political compromise, or an ad hoc balancing of competing values. 

A Theory of Justice changed all this. Rawls proposed a conception of 

justice—he called it ”justice as fairness”—that was committed to both the 

individual rights we associate with classical liberalism, and to an egalitarian ideal 

of fair distribution conventionally associated with socialist and radical democratic 

traditions. Justice as fairness, Rawls said, aims to effect a "reconciliation of 

liberty and equality." His work prompted a remarkable renaissance of political 

philosophy in the United States and elsewhere (A Theory of Justice has been 

translated into more than 20 languages), and has provided the foundation for all 

subsequent discussion about fundamental questions of social justice. 

Rawls’s proposed reconciliation of liberty and equality is expressed in his 

two principles of justice. According to the first principle—of equal basic 

liberties—each citizen has a right to the most extensive system of equal basic 

personal and political liberties compatible with a similar system of liberties for 

others. Covering both the liberties of the ancients and of the moderns, this 

principle requires stringent protections for freedom of thought and conscience; 

rights to participate in politics; freedom of association; and the rights associated 

with due process of law. These liberties, Rawls argues, have special priority and 

are not to be restricted in the name of the community’s overall good. Rawls's first 

principle also includes a demanding norm of political equality, which condemns 

inequalities in opportunities for political influence. Thus citizens with the 

motivation and ability to play an active political role should not be disadvantaged 

by a lack of personal wealth. 

Rawls's second principle of justice restricts the extent of social and 

economic inequalities. It requires, first, that jobs and positions of 

responsibility—which often carry unequal rewards—must be open to everyone 

under conditions of fair equality of opportunity. Fair equality demands that people 

who are equally talented and motivated must have equal chances to attain 

desirable positions, regardless of their social background. Access to well-

compensated, rewarding work should not depend on the circumstances in which 

people happen to have been raised. 

But even a society that achieves fair equality of opportunity might still have 

troubling economic inequalities. Suppose, for example, that some people, partly 

because of their native endowments, possess scarce talents that command high 

returns in the market, while others lack such skills. Assume people in both 

groups work hard, and contribute as best they can. Still, they will reap 

substantially different rewards, and those differences will have a large impact on 

their lives. The problem is that these inequalities of reward are founded in part on 

“natural contingencies”—on how people have fared in life’s lottery. Why, Rawls 

asks, should some people fare better than others simply because of the 

accidents of natural endowment? “There is no more reason,” Rawls urges, “to 

permit the distribution of income and wealth to be settled by the distribution of 

natural assets than by historical and social fortune.” 

To address this concern, Rawls proposes what he calls “the difference 

principle,” which requires that we maximize economic expectations for the least 

advantaged social group. This striking principle requires that we limit the extent 

to which some people are economically better off than others simply because 

they happen to have been born with a scarce talent—say, the hand-eye 

coordination of a great hitter or an unusual mathematical gift. The difference 

principle does not require flat equality: a surgeon might legitimately be paid more 

than a teacher because the higher income compensates for expensive training 

and education; and inequalities might also be used as incentives to encourage 

lawyers or venture capitalists to take on tasks they would otherwise be unwilling 

to take on. But justice commands that such inequalities work to the greatest 

benefit of those who are least well-off. 

Rawls’s large point is that we ought to reject the idea that our economic 

system is a race or talent contest, designed to reward the well-born, the swift, 

and the gifted. Instead, our economic life should be one part of a fair system of 

social cooperation, designed to ensure a reasonable life for all. "In justice as 

fairness," Rawls says, "men agree to share one another's fate. In designing 

institutions they undertake to avail themselves of the accidents of nature and 

social circumstance only when doing so is for the common benefit." 

To defend these two principles, Rawls revives the idea of a social contract 

associated with Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Kant. The social contract 

tradition proposes that the right way to organize a society is the way that the 

members themselves would agree to in an initial situation. Building on this idea, 

Rawls asks us to imagine ourselves in a hypothetical situation—he calls it the 

“original position”—in which we are to select the principles of justice that will be 

used in our own society. He designs this initial situation to reflect the moral idea 

that we are free and equal moral persons—with a capacity to cooperate with 

others on fair terms, to choose our own ends and devotions, and to pursue the 

ends we set for ourselves. So the characteristics that distinguish among us are 

irrelevant in deciding what we are entitled to as a matter of justice. We are to 

imagine, then, that our choice of principles of justice takes place behind a "veil of 

ignorance," where we do not know the irrelevant facts about our class 

background, native endowments, sex, race, or religious and moral convictions. 

We do not know, in short, whether the natural and social contingencies have 

worked in our favor. The original position with the veil of ignorance is a model: it 

models the moral irrelevance of certain facts by assuming we reason about 

justice in ignorance of those facts. Reasoning under the veil of ignorance, we put 

aside what distinguishes us from one another and focus only on what we share 

as free and equal moral persons. 

Rawls argues that people in the original position would choose his two 

principles. To see why, imagine having to choose principles for your society 

under conditions of extreme ignorance. You do not know which person you will 

be, but have to live with the principles you choose. So you will want to be sure 

that the society is acceptable to each person: after all, you could land anywhere. 

The two principles, Rawls argues, provide precisely this insurance. They ensure 

that social arrangements are acceptable to all members of a society of equals, in 

particular because of guarantees of basic liberties and fair opportunity to each 

person, and assurances of an acceptable level of resources, even for those who 

land in the lowest social position. 

Abraham Lincoln said that the United States was conceived in liberty and 

dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. A Theory of Justice 

argues that justice as fairness is the most reasonable account of justice for a 

society with that conception and dedication. 

In the 1970s and 1980s, Rawls’s proposed marriage of liberty and equality came 

under attack from two sides: libertarian political philosophers opposed his 

egalitarianism, while communitarians opposed his liberalism. The most forceful 

libertarian critique came from Robert Nozick, whose Anarchy, State, and Utopia 

presented a philosophical defense of a very limited government—a 

“nightwatchman state,” confined to protecting rights to property and person from 

aggression. Nozick’s fundamental philosophical idea was that individuals own 

themselves and are entitled to all the rewards they can reap from their 

interactions with others. Correspondingly, he argued, egalitarianism is ultimately 

founded on the morally repugnant idea that people are partial owners of one 

other. 

From the communitarian side, Michael Walzer and Michael Sandel shared 

some of Rawls’s egalitarianism, but argued that a coherent egalitarianism must 

be founded on a conception of individuals as members of a community, bound by 

deep solidarities and shared values: its redistributive principles would otherwise 

strike individuals as arbitrary burdens. But that conception, the communitarians 

argued, was at war with Rawls’s more individualistic conception of people as 

autonomous choosers, bound together by a social compact. Moreover, that 

individualistic picture was incoherent, and promoting it would threaten the bonds 

of community by giving excessive attention to individual rights of expression and 

association. 

In short, libertarians and communitarians alike rejected the marriage of 

liberalism and egalitarianism. 

In the course of reflecting on these criticisms, Rawls found that he needed 

to engage more deeply with issues of religious, moral, and philosophical 

pluralism. Those reflections culminated in his 1993 book Political Liberalism. 

Liberalism, Rawls realized, can be thought of in two ways: as an 

overarching philosophy of life—part of an encompassing moral and metaphysical 

outlook—and, more specifically, as a philosophy of politics. A liberal philosophy 

of life emphasizes the importance of autonomous personal choice as a guide to 

individual conduct. Moral liberals such as Immanuel Kant and John Stuart Mill 

argue that the unchosen life is not worth leading, and downplay the importance of 

tradition, authority, and religious texts in judging how best to live. Liberalism as a 

political outlook makes no such sweeping claims about the proper bases of 

personal decisions. Rather, it is committed to securing basic personal and 

political liberties through democratic process and a system of individual rights, 

providing a decent range of opportunities for individuals, and ensuring that 

individuals have an adequate level of resources for making use of their liberties 

and opportunities. But citizens with very different views about the importance of 

choice, tradition, authority, and text in guiding individual conduct might all 

reasonably embrace that political framework. 

Rawls was particularly concerned about disagreement between secular 

moral liberals and those who embrace religiously-based ideas about the right 

way to live. He came to think that A Theory of Justice had tied liberalism as a 

philosophy of politics—what he had come to call “political liberalism”—too closely 

to liberalism as a philosophy of life, as if only moral liberals could be political 

liberals. So he substantially revised the presentation of justice as fairness in 

order to show that it, like many other liberal political doctrines, could be 

embraced by a wide range of citizens as a shared, public ground of political 

argument. The aspiration of Political Liberalism was to show that liberalism is a 

deeply tolerant political outlook, capable of being embraced by adherents of 

different philosophies of life, both secular and religious—a political outlook that 

could serve as the focus of their overlapping consensus, and provide a shared 

public reason for a morally and religiously pluralistic democracy. 

In The Law of Peoples (1999), Rawls extended his reflections on justice to 

the global level—to an international society composed of different “peoples,” with 

distinct values, traditions, and ideas of justice. Once more, he draws on the idea 

of an initial compact. But the principles that ought to govern the society of 

peoples—the “law of peoples”—are not the object of a global compact among 

free and equal individuals; instead they are agreed to by distinct peoples. In 

describing the terms of the compact that issues in the law of peoples, toleration 

once more plays a central role. Rawls argues that a liberal democratic society 

ought not to require that all societies become liberal democracies and fully satisfy 

the principles a liberal conception of justice or endorse its conception of 

individuals as free and equal moral persons. “If all societies were required to be 

liberal,” he says, “then the idea of political liberalism would fail to express due 

toleration for other acceptable ways (if such there are, as I assume) of ordering 

society.” The law of peoples, he argues, ought to acknowledge as members in 

equal standing all “decent” peoples—those that are not aggressive in their 

relations to other peoples; that respect human rights; and that promote the 

common good of their members. But these peoples need not establish liberal 

democratic political systems. In addition to insisting that all societies protect basic 

human rights, the law of peoples imposes a duty on peoples to ensure that 

societies that are “burdened” by circumstance—extreme poverty, for example— 

are able to become just or at least decent. 

Some of Rawls’s critics expressed disappointment with his law of peoples: 

international justice, they argued, should require more of societies than that they 

achieve an acceptable minimum of decency. They found, in the law of peoples, a 

disappointing concession to cultural relativism. But Rawls disagreed. Toleration, 

he urged, is a fundamental political value. Because it is, the basic principles of 

international cooperation need to be acceptable to different peoples, who have 

“distinctive institutions and languages, religions and cultures, as well as their 

different histories,” and who do not all endorse a liberal understanding of political 

life. In acknowledging a range of reasonable differences, and freeing the law of 

peoples from too close a connection to political liberalism, we are not embracing 

relativism, or conceding anything, but keeping faith with our deepest ethical 

convictions. 

For reasons of personal temperament and intellectual conviction about the role of 

philosophy, Rawls rarely pronounced in public on specific political issues. He did 

condemn the American system of electoral finance, which he regarded as an 

insult to the equal standing of citizens in the public forum. In The Law of Peoples, 

he strongly criticized President Truman’s decision to drop nuclear weapons on 

Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He expressed a preference for achieving economic 

justice through a “property-owning democracy”—with large investments in 

education and training and widely dispersed ownership of productive 

assets—rather than a conventional welfare state—which relies on the 

redistribution of market income. And along with Robert Nozick and other leading 

political philosophers (Ronald Dworkin, Thomas Scanlon, Judith Jarvis Thomson, 

and Thomas Nagel), Rawls signed a “philosopher’s brief” to the US Supreme 

Court, urging the Court to give due attention to considerations of personal 

autonomy in deciding whether the US Constitution protects a “right to die.” 

John Rawls’s distinctive contribution to our political culture, however, lies 

in his political philosophy—a contribution that is abstract, but also deeply 

practical. There will always be an Aristophanes or a Machiavelli in our midst to 

complain that philosophers stick their heads in the clouds or bury them in the 

sand—to deny the practical importance of philosophical abstractions. So be it. By 

upholding ethical ideals, showing that they are reasonable and achievable, 

political philosophy stands on the side of hope, and struggles against cynicism 

masquerading as political realism. I visited John Rawls in the hospital in Fall 

1995 after reading a draft of his Introduction to the paperback edition of Political 

Liberalism (1996), and remarked about how he was not pulling any punches. He 

agreed, and said that he was finally expressing some things that he had been 

reluctant to say previously about the importance of political philosophy. 

In the passage we were discussing, Rawls says: “Debates about general 

philosophical questions cannot be the daily stuff of politics, but that does not 

make these questions without significance, since we what think their answers are 

will shape the underlying attitudes of the pubic culture and the conduct of politics. 

If we take for granted as common knowledge that a just and well-ordered society 

is impossible, then the quality and tone of those discussions will reflect that 

knowledge. A cause of the fall of Weimar’s constitutional regime was that none of 

the traditional elites of Germany supported its constitution or were willing to 

cooperate to make it work. They no longer believed a decent liberal 

parliamentary regime to be possible. Its time had past….President Hindenburg 

was finally persuaded to turn to Hitler, who had [popular] support and whom 

conservatives thought they could control. Others may prefer different examples.” 

I know the mocking reply to this comment: did John Rawls really believe 

that when members of the Gestapo bang down the door, you should break out 

your copy of Kant’s Grundlegung? Of course not. When the Gestapo arrive, 

philosophy’s time has long passed. To avoid the great horrors of political life, 

political values need to be a settled part of the public culture—“presupposed and 

operating in the background,” as he said elsewhere, in criticizing the deficiencies 

of our own political culture in permitting Truman’s decision to use nuclear 

weapons. Losing grip on those values is neither simple realism, nor a sign of 

political maturity: it is the beginning of calamity. 

And this is where philosophy enters: its role is to articulate principles of 

political morality, defend them from the cynicism of self-styled realists, hope they 

take hold in the background culture, and show that that hope is reasonable. This 

work is of great importance. Rawls was right that the stakes are large, and right 

to be anxious about whether he was making himself understood. Everyone who 

listened to John Rawls understood that he had lived up to the extraordinary 

demands of his subject-matter. And I hope, for all our sakes, that lots of people 

have listened.
