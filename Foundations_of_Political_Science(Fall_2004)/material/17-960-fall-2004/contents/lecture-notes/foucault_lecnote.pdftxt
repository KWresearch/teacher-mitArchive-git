Class on Foucault 

Joshua Cohen (October 22, 2004) 

1.	 General Themes in Foucault 

•	 Social construction of agency: Much of the work we have discussed 
thus far begins from a conception of agents (individuals or states) with 
goals and a picture of those agents as rationally pursuing those goals. It is 
reasonable to wonder where these agents come from, how they are 
formed. In asking how they are formed, we want to know both why agents 
have the purposes they have (rather than some alternative purposes), but 
also how it comes about that individuals—whether persons or 
states—emerge as purposeful actors, who formulate goals and (more or 
less effectively) choose means for the achievement of those goals. 
Several answers to this question might be offered, including socialization 
into cultural norms of responsible conduct. Foucault’s account emphasizes 
the role of power, in particular the disciplinary form of power, in making the 
individual, purposive agents who populate conventional theories. Such 
individuals are not given by nature, but formed by distinctive social 
practices which operate directly—and in the minutest details—on the 
bodies and activities of individuals. (Analogous to the idea, in IR, that 
circumstantial constraints impose unitary, rational agency on states.) 

•	 Hermeneutics of suspicion: The emphasis on the role of power, 
especially disciplinary power, in forming individuals as agents is part of a 
more general view about the essential role of power in shaping the 
practices that we value in part because we think of them as infused with 
values rather than molded by power. In particular, knowledge-seeking in 
the human sciences and justice-seeking in law and politics are driven by 
power in ways that are not evident and that we do not acknowledge. So (i) 
knowledge in the human sciences (clinical medicine, child psychology, 
educational psychology) is founded on disciplinary power, and the 
surveillance, concerns about normality/standardization, and constant 
assessment associated with such power: more fundamentally, by the mix 
of objectives of producing docility/obedience and usefulness (both 
individual and collective); (ii) equality we associate with rule of law and 
democracy is founded on disciplinary practices (the “dark side”) that mold 
the individuals who we represent as free and equal subjects: “the real, 
corporal disciplines constituted the foundation of the formal, juridical 
liberties” (222). The disciplines assure the submission needed for social 
order in a society of individuals who are formally free and equal: they 
provide “the cohesion of [the] social body” (Two Lectures, p. 106). More 
broadly, the historical processes that are commonly represented as 
relaxing constraints on individuals actually involve new forms of 

constraint—new modalities/technologies of power—that may be less 
gruesome and violent, but more meticulously controlling. 

•	 Pervasiveness of Power: more generally, social processes are 
pervasively power-ridden. To appreciate this ubiquity of power, we need to 
break from the picture of power as exercised by a central authority 
(association of power with sovereignty), or dominated by a single group 
(class). What is singular is not the agent who exercises power, but the 
technology of power—a way of deploying power—that is present in a 
dispersed set of social institutions and practices, even if its place in those 
practices is disguised and concealed by a focus on power as emanating 
principally from a sovereign authority, where the exercise of that central 
power can be legitimated through law and consent. 

2.	 General Argument about Punishment 

The argument about disciplinary power is part of a more specific and focused 
argument about the power to punish, and the emergence of a particular way to 
exercise that power. 

Foucault distinguishes three ways of organizing the power to punish, which are 
associated with (1) monarchical law, which uses intense and discontinuous 
terror, to ceremonialize sovereign power through vengeance against the body of 
the criminal, who was an enemy of the sovereign, and whose torture affirmed the 
sovereign’s power; (2) reforming jurists, who use signs or representations which 
announce detailed schedules of public sanctions associated with violations of 
law, and aim to reestablish the standing of individuals as equal subjects; for the 
reforming jurists, imprisonment is to be used only in exceptional cases (in 
response to crimes that limit the liberty of others), and a wide range of other 
sanctions (public works, fines, public shaming) used to instruct the public about 
the rules and provide incentives for compliance; and (3) prisons, in which a 
specialized administrative apparatus uses coercion to train the body and leaves 
traces in the habits of individuals. The question is: why do we see the rapid 
emergence of prisons—the “coercive, corporal, solitary, secretive model of the 
power to punish”—as the dominant form of punishment? Foucault’s answer is 
that the emergence of the prison is one part of the emergence of a much broader 
range of disciplinary practices, in schools, hospitals, armies, and factories, all of 
which use the same polyvalent “technology of power.” So understanding the 
emergence of prisons proceeds by understanding what a disciplinary society is, 
what is distinctive about the disciplinary mode of power, and what accounts for 
the widespread reliance on disciplinary power and thus for a disciplinary society. 

So we have three questions: (1) what is a disciplinary society and what 
generically speaking is disciplinary power; (2) what are the main characteristics 
and methods of disciplinary power; (3) how and why does the disciplinary form of 
power emerge and spread throughout the social body? 

In conjunction with the third question: we want to know how Foucault can explain 
the emergence of a disciplinary society without relying, in the explanation, on 
conceptions of individual agency that he suggests are only formed by the spread 
of disciplinary power itself. 

3.	 What, generally speaking, is disciplinary society/disciplinary power? 

a)  Discipline: (i) general formula for domination: techniques for ordering 
human multiplicities that can be used in different institutions: armies 
(modeled on Protestant armies), schools (modeled on Jesuit colleges), 
hospitals (modeled on military hospitals); (ii) characteristic of discipline: 
detailed/meticulous; focused on body/movement; organization of space, 
time, movement; (iii) objective of disciplines is, generically speaking, to get 
an ideal mix of docility and utility, of obedience and usefulness, in a 
multiplicity. Not simply trying to control, but to make maximally effective 
use as well, and in particular to make maximally effective not simply of 
individuals but of multiplicity. In this respect, different from slavery, 
service, vassalage, and monasticism; (iv) more particularly, they have the 
triple objective of minimizing costs, both economic and political (low 
resistance, low visibility); maximizing intensive effects (no gaps or 
intervals in exercise of power); maximizing output of apparatus (education, 
production, military force, health). 

b)  A disciplinary society is a society in which there is widespread reliance on 
disciplinary institutions—i.e. institutions in which the disciplinary 
technology of power is deployed—and in which disciplinary power is 
implicated with non-disciplinary forms of power (216). Society in which 
disciplines are no longer used simply as a method for quarantining 
dangerous populations, but spread through the whole social body: 
happens in the 18th century. 

So what we want to know is how and why it happens that methods of ordering 
groups of people that aim at an optimal mix of docility and usefulness come to 
predominate. 

4.	 What are specific characteristics and means used by disciplinary 
power? 

a) Four aspects of the individuality formed by disciplinary power: 

(i)	

Cellular: control of space and assignment of people to locations 
(using tables) that serve both to control opposition (in part by 

(ii)	

(iii)	

(iv)	

surveillance, in part by separation) and to generate maximal 
product. The complex task of spatial aspect of discipline is that 
you can’t simply isolate people from one another, at work or in 
army (that may work for some kinds of manufacturing, with 
piece work, but not for tasks that require coordination). Need to 
have controlled collaboration. 

Organic: use of maneuvers to train the body so that its 
capacities are maximized, and no energy is wasted. Train the 
activities of body down to particular gestures; train the whole 
body itself so that these particular gestures are made with 
greatest effectiveness and speed (as in teaching handwriting, 
including instructions in posture and positioning of all parts of 
body); and ensure that the gestures and overall training of the 
body fits the body to the tools it uses (weapons, machines). 

Genetic: organization of time, so that individuals pass through a 
series of exercises of increasing complexity, while aiming to 
make them maximally usable at the end (as in teaching or in 
military training). 

Combinatory: not simply a division of tasks, but uses tactics to 
get a composition of forces that is greater than the sum of the 
parts. Individuals are formed in ways that make them fit 
together, and so that their joint action is triggered by relatively 
simple directives (commands issues by officers, or teachers). 
“Discipline is no longer simply an art of distributing bodies 
[cellular], of extracting time from them [organic] and 
accumulating it [genetic], but of composing forces in order to 
obtain an efficient machine” (164). 

b) Three means used by disciplinary power: 

(i)	

(ii)	

observation (surveillance) 

normalizing judgment: use of common set of standards to which all 
are to conform, and by reference to which all are graded and 
judged. 

(iii)	

examination 

5.  How and why do we get disciplines spreading? 

a)  How: (i) functional inversion: shift in the role of discipline from increasing 
control to increasing capacity; from capturing deserters to coordinating 

and constructing more effective military power; from preventing theft of 
materials in the factory to increasing labor productivity; from confining 
disorderly children to training them for useful activity; (ii) swarming (spilling 
out): extension of surveillance and control to surrounding populations 
(schools to parents and neighbors; hospitals to surrounding populations); 
mobile disciplinary organizations (charitable group with geographic 
responsibility); (iii) state involvement in disciplines through the police, who 
control local disorders in response to initiatives from below. 

b)  Why? (i) the triple objective (reduced cost, increased control, increased 
output) “corresponds to” large demographic thrust with associated growth 
in floating population and scale of groups (in schools, military); and growth 
in scale and complexity and cost of productive apparatus (economic, 
educational, military, medical); (ii) need to “adjust their correlation,” which 
seems to mean a need to develop new arrangements that can restore 
order (profitability?) under these changed conditions; (iii) existing forms of 
power (monarchy, feudal hierarchy, local mechanisms) are too costly (to 
Treasury, to the population, in promoting resistance, and in relying on 
extraction); (iv) disciplines enter in as ways to order the multiplicity of men 
and new productive apparatuses: reduce inefficiency, master resistance, 
increase capacity of each element, promote coordination. 

So, disciplines emerge as ways to control and make productive use of large 
numbers and large institutions, while reduces the costs of the apparatus 
needed to exercise that control: “discipline is the unitary technique by 
which the body is reduced as a ‘political’ force at the least cost and 
maximized as a useful force” (221). The disciplines are “the ensemble of 
minute technical inventions that made it possible to increase the useful 
size of multiplicities by decreasing the inconveniences of the power which, 
in order to make them useful, must control them” (220). 

c)  What sort of explanation do we have, then, of the emergence and spread 
of disciplines, and the formation of a disciplinary society? Not an 
explanation that focuses on agents acting on their interests or ideas, but a 
functional explanation: that is, we have an account of the emergence of a 
new modality of power by reference, roughly, to the fact that its 
emergence has effects of a certain kind. And the effects seem to be not 
simply a matter of survival, but a matter of optimizing: least cost methods 
of generating maximal outputs (or even reduced cost methods of 
generating increased outputs). Now this kind of explanation fits with 
Foucault’s concern to tell the story about the emergence of disciplinary 
society without relying on an account of individual agents. But why would 
the fact (assuming it is a fact) that disciplinary power/society has effects of 
the kind indicated lead account for its emergence. There are two standard 
ways to fill out functional explanations: Darwinian and purposive. 

i) 	

ii)	

The Darwinian elaboration explains the presence of a 
condition by reference to the contribution of that condition to 
the fitness of an organism, and then observes that it is hardly 
surprising that we observe organisms to have fitness-
enhancing conditions, because in a competitive 
environment, only the organisms with the fitness-enhancing 
conditions survive. The problem with the natural selection 
story, for the social case, is that the competitive mechanism 
is not so obviously in force: thus we do not see systems 
dying off. 

The purposive elaboration says that we get changes with the 
desirable effects because agents can see that the changes 
are needed to achieve some desired state and those agents 
have the capacity to enforce the necessary changes. Now 
this might be the right story, but it is not one that Foucault 
can happily accept, because it supposes that we have 
already-constituted agents whose aims and capacities 
account for the change.
