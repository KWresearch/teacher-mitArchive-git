Class on Olson 

1.	 Why is this important? 

•	 Central Thesis: the existence of a common interest among a set of 
people—an interest that could be advanced through collective 
action—does not lead to voluntary collective action to advance the 
interest. More particularly, failures to advance common interests—to act in 
ways that make each person better off—are fully consistent with 
individually rational agency and good information. 

•	 Microfoundational Thesis: Ideas about individual rational action (and 
relatedly, about incentives) that are understood to be relevant in thinking 
about economic activity are also relevant in thinking about collective 
action: more generally, that the distinction between economics and 
sociology (including political sociology) is a difference in domain of inquiry 
(a difference in the phenomena being studied), not in the nature or “logic” 
of individual action. More particularly, that a great deal of collective action 
(and failure of collective action) in society and in politics, can be 
understood in terms of a rational pursuit of goals (utility maximizing)—with 
action based on an assessment of the costs and benefits of an 
action—and does not involve either norm-guided action (action explained 
by reference to standards of right/wrong or appropriate/inappropriate 
conduct, perhaps associated with roles in an institution) or action 
animated by some form of group identification. In both these cases, the 
person decides what to do not simply by reference to the consequences of 
his/her conduct, but by references to considerations that apply to the 
action itself: its rightness, for example. 

•	 Political-Sociological Thesis: Collective action problems are solved by 
hegemons (and other large players), who are sufficiently interested in a 
collective good to bear the costs of ensuring its provision; by smaller 
groups, whose members can identify their contribution to the provision of 
the good; and by the existence of (positive and negative) selective 
benefits, which lead people to contribute to the provision of a collective 
good in order to gain a private good or avoid a private bad. 

•	 Political Thesis: Against a certain picture of pluralism and group politics: 
that even under fair conditions, with basic rights protected and a 
reasonable distribution of resources—even with a perfected political 
market—we can get a highly skewed political universe, with group 
organization and power unreflective of underlying levels of support, and 
political outcomes reflective of this skewed system of group bargaining. 

2.	 Central Thesis: the existence of a common interest that could be 
advanced through collective action may well not lead to collective action, 
even among fully rational and informed actors. 

•	 One way in which this is true is when actors are concerned about relative 
gains: (i) arguably true in the international case, where the concern about 
relative gains reflects the concern that an unequal distribution of the 
benefits of a cooperative activity may lead to threats to security; (ii) also 
true when we have envy and associated concerns about relative positions. 
But neither of these cases is really germane here, because in in both 
cases, the potential cooperators would not really be, all things considered, 
better off if they were to pursue common action: there would be some 
gain, but the agents themselves would not regard the gain as, all things 
considered, worth it, as it would be overridden by the resulting security 
threat (in case (i)) or (in case (ii)) the resulting loss in relative position 
which may matter as much as absolute position. What we are looking for 
are cases in which acting collectively would make each person better off 
(by their own lights) than they will be in the absence of such action, but the 
agents nonetheless do not act collectively. 

•	 Most familiar case is the one-shot prisoner’s dilemma: in this case, we 
have a unique, dominant strategy equilibrium (with both agents 
confessing), and the equilibrium is suboptimal. An outcome is an 
equilibrium just in case neither person has any incentive to shift choice, 
given the choice of the other; it is a dominant strategy equilibrium just in 
case each agent has a choice which is better no matter what the other 
person chooses (a dominant strategy); and the equilibrium is suboptimal in 
that each person could be better off (if both refused to confess). 

•	 A second, and distinct case in which rational agents may not be able to 
coordinate in a way that makes each better off is what is called “an 
assurance problem.” In this case, we do not have a dominant strategy 
equilibrium. So if I am confident that you will do your part, then my best 
response is to do mine (reciprocity). But in the circumstances, I cannot 
rationally be confident that you will do your part: say, if you don’t, things 
will work out very badly for me. So I rationally choose not to cooperate, 
because the harm from being suckered is so much greater than the loss 
from not cooperating. (Maybe I do not cooperate because I simply think 
you may not; or because I think that you may not because I think that you 
think I am not going to because you think I am going to protect myself 
from the possibility of your not cooperating). 

•	 Now both the one-shot PD and the one-shot assurance game are 
obviously highly artificial because they are abstracted from a larger, 
setting that is not itself “modeled.” So what happens when we think of the 
PD as being played repeatedly. Do we still get a failure to cooperate for 

mutual benefit among rational individuals? The standard answer is that 
repetition makes no difference if the game is played a definite number of 
times. The argument proceeds by backwards induction: each person sees 
that it is irrational to cooperate on round N, inasmuch as that last stage is 
equivalent to paying once. But then it is not rational to cooperate at stage 
N-1, because that is in effect the final stage, and so on back to the initial 
stage. Now notice that this backwards induction argument for universal 
defection assumes that there is common knowledge of rationality: each of 
us knows that the other is going to defect at the last stage, and that the 
other knows that I know that, etc. So suppose instead when I am 
anticipating the last stage, I can see that it is rational for me to defect, but I 
may not know whether you are rational or not. If you are not, then whether 
you defect or not may depend on what I did at round N-1 (tit for tat, or 
imitation, or cooperate until other has defected). So suppose in particular 
that I think that there is some chance that what you do at the last round 
depends on my conduct in the next to last round (that your strategy is to 
cooperate so long I cooperate). And suppose that you, while in fact fully 
rational and prepared to defect in the last round, think that there is some 
chance that I am not rational, and that I may cooperate at the last stage if 
you do at N-1. In this case, because of the imperfect information, we may 
get cooperation by rational players, uncertain of the rationality of others, 
until the final round (so long as the players care sufficiently about the 
future). Though we may also, despite the repetition, get defection from the 
start. So we have another case in which cooperation is possible and would 
be beneficial for each, but may not be achieved. Though as I just 
indicated, we may also get cooperation. 

•	 When we shift to the indefinitely-repeated PD, cooperation may once more 
emerge, even with rational players, with common knowledge of 
rationality—depending on the nature of the payoffs and the rate of time 
discount (patience). Cooperation on every round is one equilibrium for 
patient players, but so is defection on every round: there is not, as in the 
one-shot case, a unique equilibrium. In this case, rational players need not 
end up failing to cooperate (as in the one-shot case, or the finite case with 
common knowledge of rationality), but they may fail to cooperate even in 
the face of possible gains for all. But it would be a mistake say that 
rationality dictates an expectation of non-cooperation. 

•	 The final case to consider is the case of a collective good: some good 
such that if it is provided for any, it is provided for all (in some specified 
group). So if the good is available, then you benefit, even if you do not 
contribute. Then you will not contribute unless: (1) the good is sufficiently 
important and you have sufficient capacity, that it is worth it to you to 
provide the good on your own, even if others do not contribute (they 
exploit you); or (2) your contribution is needed (along with some others) in 
order to ensure the provision of the good: your contribution makes a 

noticeable difference (most plausible when numbers are small); (3) you 
think that contribution (participation) itself is either desirable or obligatory 
(even if some or even all others abstain); or (4) you get some benefit or 
are subject to some cost causally contingent on your contributing 
(participating). So there are cases here, but dominance reasoning does 
not apply: whether it is rational to contribute depends on subtleties of 
circumstance, including strength of interest, visibility of contribution. 

3.	 Case of Unions: contrast the Olson and Perlman theories 

•	 What is the phenomenon to be explained? Two issues: (i) growth in 
numbers of unionized workers; (ii) focus of unions on “job-control,” that is, 
protecting wages and working conditions rather than on politics (part of a 
larger story about American exceptionalism—the absence of a strong 
socialist movement in the United States—an essential element of which is 
the particularly economistic character of American unions. And the 
premise of the argument is that unions provide collective goods, in the 
form of wages, working conditions, and legislative benefits. 

•	 Olson’s theory: (i) start with smaller unions (skilled workers, not because 
of some special sense of solidarity among the skilled, but because they 
are in smaller workplaces). Because the groups are small, worries about 
free riders are diminished (contributions of each are important to the 
provision of the good), and there are plausibly benefits to membership 
itself (social units); (ii) these unions have an incentive to expand in order 
to take wages out of competition (in effect, protecting wages of members 
by protecting firms from low-wage competition), protect themselves 
against strikebreakers, help members to navigate the broader labor 
market, expand their political strength (in dealing with legislature); (iii) 
once they grow, they need to hold members, and this requires a 
combination of compulsory unionism (closed shop), picket lines and other 
forms of forcible protection during strikes, and selective benefits 
(insurance, grievance protections, seniority); (iv) but it is hard to sustain 
larger unions with positive selective benefits, esp. with public insurance 
programs in a welfare state; (v) so you end up with an emphasis on 
compulsory unionism (closed shop) as a strategy by an organization to 
preserve members, who would rationally prefer to get the collective 
benefits without paying the costs of membership, but if they did free ride, 
they would all lose. So the combination of focus on economic conditions at 
work and on closed shop (coercion)—the features that define job control 
unionism—reflect the demands of an organization whose members are 
assumed to be rational actors. 

•	 Perlman’s theory: (i) begins with the idea that workers (esp. manual 
workers) are pessimistic: they are fearful about losing jobs, which they 

assume to be scarce (they show “scarcity consciousness”). So we begin 
with a richer psychological assumption (which may be explained by social 
or historical circumstances, in the US in particular, where job control 
unionism has flourished); (ii) because they are pessimistic about 
prospects of job loss, they want to have organizations that protect their 
jobs and wages. So on this argument, job control unionism is not the result 
of an organizational imperative—the demand of holding onto members, 
who are assumed to be rational. Instead, it is a reflection of the 
psychology of members. (An alternative argument, along similar lines, 
would be that workers think of jobs in specific firms as a kind of property 
right, and want organizations that will protect their property rights in those 
jobs.) 

4.	 How does Olson criticize the Perlman theory? 

•	 The point of the criticism is to show that the phenomena discussed by 
Perlman can be better explained by Olson, on the assumption that 
workers are rational agents, and that their organizations need to provide 
them with selective incentives—rather by reference to the psychology of 
workers. 

•	 One line of argument is about the historical evidence of when unions 
expand: there are three large periods of such expansion, and in each case 
labor markets are tight, from which Olson concludes that the explanation 
in terms of worker pessimism is flawed: why would workers be pessimistic 
when labor markets are tight. But this criticism seems mistaken. 
Pessimism means that workers overestimate the chances of losing their 
jobs, and want to protect against such less. So they unionize when labor 
markets are tight because that is when they have the power to organize 
without fear of job loss: but the basic pessimism may not disappear when 
markets are tight, not if it is a basic psychological disposition. So they 
organize when they have greatest power and can most likely succeed, not 
when they have greatest need and will likely fail. 

•	 A second line of argument is about the demand for labor: here the idea is 
that it makes no sense for workers and their organizations to demand 
higher wages if they are worried about job loss, unless they think that the 
elasticity of demand for labor is zero. Here again, the argument is not 
compelling. Suppose that workers want to protect their jobs and improve 
wages and working conditions. They fear job loss to workers who can be 
paid less, so the union does not permit the firm to pay new employees 
less; and they fear loss of jobs when other firms cut costs, so they try to 
ensure industry-wide unionization, which takes wages out of competition. 

•	 A third point concerns attendance at union meetings: Olson suggests that 
low attendance raises troubles for Perlman perhaps because it suggests 

that workers are not especially invested in their organizations. But if they 
see unions as protecting jobs and wages, and if the unions are doing that 
without high attendance, then why attend? Perlman’s story is about having 
organizations that are effective agents of worker demands for job and 
wage protection, not about workers identifying with the union. 

I am not here defending the Perlman view, just suggesting that Olson’s case 
against it does not seem very strong, and his defense of the selective benefits 
theory of job-control unionism seems correspondingly weakened.
