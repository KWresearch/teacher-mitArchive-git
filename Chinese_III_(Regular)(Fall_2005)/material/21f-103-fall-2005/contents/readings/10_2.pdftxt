10.5  Minor Constructions 

10.5.1  Chúle … yǐwài  
Chúle…yǐwài means literally ‘having removed…and put aside’, hence ‘besides; except 
for; other than’. The clause following will generally contain an inclusive adverb, such as 
dōu, yě, or hái. In more formal contexts, yǐwài can be rendered as zhī wài, with the 
Classical Chinese particle zhī. (Cf. zhī yī ‘one of’ and zhīqián, the formal alternative to 
yǐqián ‘before’.) Sometimes, either the first part of the expression (chúle) or the second 
(yǐwài) will be omitted.  
 

Chúle Zhōngwén yǐwài nǐ hái huì   What foreign languages do you speak other 
shuō shénme wàiyǔ? 
than Chinese? 
 
Chúle zhōumò (yǐwài), tā biéde  
shíhou dōu bú zài jiā.

Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang, remains!

Except for the weekends, he’s never

Notes 

a) Jiàn V ‘build; construct’; cf. jiànlì ‘set up; establish’. 
b) Dìjī N ‘ground; base; foundation (land-base)’. 
 

 
 
 
10.5.2  Yuèlái yuè (SV) ‘more and more SV’ 
 
Ài, shìjiè yuèlái yuè luàn. 

Gosh, the world is getting more and more 
chaotic. 

 
Dà chéngshì yuèlái yuè wēixiǎn. 

Big cities are becoming more and more 
dangerous.  
That’s because there are more and more 
people.

want to eat them.

Exercise 3 
Explain that although things are getting more and more expensive, people (rénmen) are 
also earning (zhuàn) more and more money. Take fruit: in the past people used to eat 
water melons in the spring and apples in the fall. That was it. Occasionally there were 
also bananas or oranges. But except for those, you couldn’t find any other fruit, and 
couldn’t afford to buy any other fruit. But now, the situation (qíngxing) is quite different. 
Now you can buy oranges and bananas in the winter. But they are much more expensive 
than in the past. When I was a child, we used to pay about 90 cents for a bunch (M 
chuàn) of bananas. Now you pay RMB 4-5. But the more expensive they are, they more 
they sell! It’s amazing.

10.6  Xiēhòuyǔ, a form of word play 
An expression in the last section, bú bìyào de shǒuxù, conjures up a pungent example of a 
class of Chinese word play known as xiēhòuyǔ. Xiēhòuyǔ consist of two parts: the first 
part, which is stated, poses a riddle; the second part, which is usually not stated, answers 
it. But the creativity of the xiēhòuyǔ comes from the fact that the unstated anwer requires 
further interpretation for it to apply to the situation. Here are a few examples: 
 
 
 
 

implied 

stated   

 

 

 

unstated 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

      >  bù dǒng, bù dǒng. 
budong, budong [noise]  

Háma tiào jǐng  
toad jumps+in well 
 
Fēijī shàng guà nuǎnpíng   >  gāo shuǐpíng. 
airplane on hang thermos; 
high ‘water-level’  

Shíbā suì zhào jìngzi         >   lǎo yàngzi. 
18 yrs-old reflect mirror 
as always 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

14

> not understand 

 

 
 
 

> high standard 

> no change 
[Because by 18,  
 you’re grown.]

Tuō kùzi fàng pì 
> 
remove trousers put fart 

bú bìyào de shǒuxù. 
unnecessary DE procedures  > red tape 

And the more earthy example suggested by the earlier phrase: 
 
 
 
 
While it is useful to know about xiēhòuyǔ, using them in speech would suggest a level of 
language use that would be hard for anybody but the most advanced students to sustain. 
In some ways, xiēhòuyǔ, like proverbs or sayings, can be mastered just like any other 
vocabulary, by observing – or being told – actual usage and then trying them out warily. 
However, they are used sparingly in ordinary conversation – particularly to foreigners – 
and so in the foundation stages of study, it is enough to be aware of them, and collect 
other examples from Chinese friends – who are usually delighted to talk about the 
subject.  
 

10.7 Religion 
Though the official line in China is that religions are superstition (míxìn, which means, 
literally, ‘confused belief’), nowadays some religious activity is tolerated, provided it 
does not show potential for threatening the power of the state. Chinese, knowing that 
formal religion plays a more prominent role in the life of many foreigners, will often ask 
about religious affiliation. 
 

 
 
 

What’s your religion? 
I’m Buddhist. (‘Buddhism-follower’) 
I don’t have a religion.  

Nĭ xìn shénme jiào? 
Wŏ shi Fójiàotú. 
Wŏ bú xìn jiào.  
 
Answers would generally be expected to come from the following (alphabetical) list:

a) jiào ‘teachings’, reduced from zóngjiào ‘religion’. 
b) tú ‘disciple; follower’, a bound form; as noted, tú is not used for followers of 
all religions.

c) Moslems are considered a minority group (shǎoshù mínzú) in China – the only 
minority group defined in terms of religion. 
d) While ordinary people in Chinese know about Tiānzhǔjiào, there is often some 
confusion about the difference between Jīdūjiào and Xīnjiào. 
e) It is often argued that Taoism (Dàojiào) and Buddhism operate syncretically, ie 
within a single system. In ordinary speech, people often identify themselves – or 
others – as Fójiàotú, or xìn Fójiào de, but not xìn Dàojiào de.  
f) Because of their importance in US history, the Puritans, Qīnqjiàotú ‘clear-
religion-followers’, are also well known in China.

Notes 

 

 

Buddhist priests are known as héshàng; Catholic priests are shénfu; protestant 
pastors are mùshi (‘shepherd – teacher’); non-specialists would be unlikely to 
know the comparable terms for the other religions.

10.8 Verb Combos (4) 
Students of English know the difficulty of dealing with its vast repertoire of ‘phrasal 
verbs’: check in, check out, check up; or pick on, pick off, pick up, pick out. The second 
element of these combinations is a directional particle; but the meaning of the whole is 
often not easily deduced from its component parts. In other words, many are idiomatic. In 
Chinese, verb-combos present much the same problem. While some are transparent 
(náguòqu), others are harder to derive from the elements involved (mǎibuqǐ). For this 
reason, they have been introduced incrementally. This section introduces a few more 
idiosyncratic sets. 
 
 
10.8.1  –xiàlai 
Verbs of recording or notation are completed by the directional complement xiàlai, 
roughly corresponding to ‘down’ in English. The relevant verbs are: 
 
 

 

lù 
 
zhào 
record  photograph 

huà 
 
draw; paint 

miáo 
trace 

xiě 
 
bèi 
jì 
write  note  memorize 

 
 
Usage 
   1.  Qǐng bǎ tā xiěxiàlai. 

 

 

Shuō màn yìdiănr, wŏ jìbuxiàlai.  
 
 
 

   2. 

 

Would you mind writing it down. 
 
Speak slower – I can’t get it down.

   3.  Méi tīngqīngchu, nĭ shì bu shì  
bǎ tā jìxiàlai le? 
Jìxiàlai le, nĭ kàn. 
 
Ng, wǒ kànbudǒng. 
 
Wǒ de zì xiě+de bù hǎo. 
 
Tāmen shuō de hěn yǒu yìsi;   
wǒmen yīnggāi bǎ tā lùxiàlai.  

   4. 

 
 
 

I didn’t hear clearly, did you get it down? 

Yes, I did, look.  
Er, I can’t read it. 
I didn’t write the characters very well. 

What they’re saying is fascinating; we 
should record it.  
 
It would be best if we traced that map. 

   5.  Wǒmen zuì hǎo bǎ nèi zhāng   
 
dìtú miáoxiàlai. 
 
10.8.2 – chūlai 
Chūlai, with the literal meaning of ‘come out’, combines with verbs of perception to 
mean ‘figure out; recognize’: 
 

Yīnwèi tā de màozi, wŏ bǎ tā   
rènchūlai le.  [rènshi] 

I recognized him by his hat. 

 

 

 

 

 

Nĭ cāidechūlai wŏ shi shéi ma? 
Cāibuchūlai.    
 
 

Dǎ diànhuà de shíhou tīngbuchū- 
lai tā shi wàiguó rén.    
 
 
Nǐ kàndechū zhèi ge dìfang yǒu 
hěn duō biànhuà! 
 
 
 

Can you guess who I am? 
No, I can’t. 
 
On the phone, you can’t hear that 
she’s a foreigner.  

You can see that this place has a lot  
of changes.  

 

   Shànghǎi [2006]: Wǒ rènbuchū zhèi ge dìfang lái le !

10.8.3 Moving out 
Hǎi Bó is trying to get in touch with his friend Xǔ Chángdé. But when he phones his 
apartment, the woman who answers doesn’t know where he is. Note how the selection of 
particular verb complements can modify the verb bān ‘move’. 
 
Hǎi  Wei, qǐng zhǎo Xǔ Chángdé ji 
diànhuà. 
 
 
 

Hello, may I speak to Xǔ Chángdé?   
 
 
 
 

 
Xǔ Chángdé? He’s moved away. 

Nǚde  Xǔ Chángdé a, tā bānzǒu le.   
 
Hǎi 

Tā bānjiā le ma? 

 

 

Nǚde  Shì, bānjiā le.   

Hǎi  Bāndào nǎlǐ, zhīdao ma? 

Nǚde  Bù zhīdào. 

 

 

 

 

 

He’s moved?   
 
 
Yes. 
 
Do you know where he’s gone? 
 
I don’t know.   
 
 
 
Tā shi shénme shíhou bānchūqu de?  When did he move out? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hǎi 
 
Nǚde  Bù zhīdào. Wǒmen běn yuè chū  
 
bānjìnlai de.    
 
 

Hǎi  Hǎo, duō xiè.   
 
Nǚde  Bú xiè!  
 
Notes 

 

 

 

 

 

Don’t know. We moved in at the 
beginning of the month.  
 
Okay, thanks.   

 

 

You’re welcome! 

 

a) Wei is an interjection, used to open a telephone conversation, or call out to 
someone.  
b) Qǐng zhǎo X jiē diànhuà is the conventional way of asking to speak to 
someone, literally ‘invite find X connect phone’. 
c) Běn yuè chū, literally ‘root month beginning’, ie ‘at the beginning of the 
current month’; cf. běn yuè dǐ ‘at the end of the month’.
