Literally ‘1000 <pieces of> gold’, a tongue-in-cheek reference to 
daughters, eg liӽngqiƗn jƯn ‘2000 pieces of gold’ for ‘2 daughters’. 
Liӽng dùn ‘two tons’ is, of course, a humorous response. 2 tons is 
4000 lbs or 4000 gold pieces. In some southern regions, instead of 
qiƗnjƯn, daughters are described as jƯnhuƗ ‘golden flowers’: sì duԁ 
jƯnhuƗ ‘4 M gold-flowers’. 
zhàopiƗn<r> 	 N ‘photograph; picture (photograph-slice)’, or more colloquially, 
xiàngpiƗn<r> ‘photos’, both with level toned piƗn<r>. Without the 
r-suffix, both words are often pronounced with falling tone on 
piàn: zhàopiàn, xiàngpiàn. 
Children (sons or daughters) can be referred to as lӽodà, lӽo’èr, 
lӽosƗn, etc., according to relative age; also hángdà, háng’èr, 
hángsƗn, etc. (with háng ‘a row’). 
	V ‘believe’

8.10  V+le revisited 
As noted in earlier units, le (˞) may appear at the foot of sentences to signal a change in phase 
(xiànzài hӽo le; yӿjing chƯfàn le), or it may intervene between a verb and its object to signal 
priority or completion. (Of course, if no object is present, then the two le’s can only be 
distinguished by function – or meaning.) Historically, the two types – or two positions – of le are 
thought to have different sources. Post-verbal le is said to derive from destressing of the verb liӽo 
‘finish’, which is also written ˞ (cf. liӽobuqӿ), and in fact, in recitation styles, le is read liӽo, as 
in the following line from the song DǀngfƗng Hóng ‘The East is Red’: Zhǀngguó chǌliӽo yí ge 
Máo Zédǀng. Sentence le, on the other hand, is thought to derive from destressing of the verb lái 
‘come’, so chƯfàn le is, in an etymological sense, ‘to have come to the present state of having 
eaten’. 

8.10.1  Sequence of events 
One particularly clear manifestation of V+le is found in sequences, where the second event is 
conditional on the completion of the first: 

37 

Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin  

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

Shénme shíhou mӽi piào? 
Shàngle chƝ jiu măi piào. 

When do we buy our tickets? 
Buy your tickets after boarding. 

And, of course, where the conditions are more severe, cái may substitute for jiù: 

Néng chǌqu wánr ma? 
NƱ chƯle fàn cái néng chǌqu wánr. 

Can [I] go out to play? 
You can’t go out to play until you’ve eaten. 

Wǂ zăoshàng chƯle xiànrbƱng 
cái yǂu jƯngshen. 

Mornings, I can’t function until I’ve 
eaten a meat-pancake. (‘stuffed pancake’) 

In such cases, V-le O occupies the same position in the sentence as a time word: 

Wǂ sƗn diӽn huíjiƗ. 
Wǂ chƯle fàn jiù huíjiƗ. 
 Wǂ xiàle kè cái huíjiƗ. 

I’m going home at 3. 

I’m going home after I eat.

I’m not going home until after class. 


A sentence le can be added to the clause as a whole to indicate that the event has 
happened: 

TƗ chƯle fàn jiu huí jiƗ le. 

She went home after [she] ate. 

Le after the first verb in these sentences serves much the same purpose as yƱhòu 
‘afterwards’, and in fact, where the second event is less likely to follow immediately on 
the first, yƱhòu may be preferred; or verb-le and yƱhòu may both occur. 

TƗ bì<le> yè yƱhòu dăsuàn qù 
He’s planning to go abroad to study in 
Zhǀngguó liúxué. 
China after he graduates. 
(Some speakers say bìyè le yƱhòu, treating bìyè as a compound verb.) 

8.10.2  V-le with quantified objects 
Another environment that is highly conducive to the post-verbal le was noted earlier: reference to 
particular prior events. One manifestation of this is the presence of a ‘quantified object’ (a 
numbered object). Contrast the following pairs: 

vs 

Or:

vs 

ZuótiƗn wԁ qù Cháng Chéng le. 

I visited the Great Wall yesterday. 

ZuótiƗn wԁ qù-le yí tàng 
Cháng Chéng. 

I took a trip to the Great Wall yesterday. 

 TƗ shuìjiào le. 

She’s gone to bed. 

Ta shuì-le bƗ ge xiӽoshí. 
TƗ shuì-le bƗ ge xiӽoshí<de> jiào. 

She slept for 8 hours. 
She slept 8 hours of sleep. 

38

Cf. 

TƗ yƱjing shuì-le bƗ ge xiӽoshí 
<de> jiào le. 

She’s been sleeping for 8 hours already! 

A short dialogue 

Jiӽ.  Lèi ma?	
 Y΃.  HČn lèi, shuì+de bù h΁o. 
Jiӽ.  ZƗogƗo!	
 
 
 
 Y΃.  Zh΃ shuì-le sƗn sì ge zhǀngtou! 
Jiӽ.  Nà, nƱ yƯnggƗi xiǌxi yíxià. 

Tired?

Sure am, [I] didn’t sleep well. 

Too bad!

[I] only slept 3 or 4 hours! 

You should take a break then. 

For a Chinese speaker, the relevant criterion is probably not the presence of a quantified 
object per se. But the notion of ‘quantified object’ is a useful marker for learners trying to figure 
out whether le should be placed after the object (at the foot of the sentence) or directly after the 
verb. Other examples: 

1. 

	TƗ huàn-le qián jiu qù-le yí tàng 
gòuwù-zhǀngxƯn. 

He changed some money and then took a 
trip to the mall. 

Notes 

a) huàn-le qián is the condition;

b) qù-le yí tàng is a ‘prior event, with quantified object’. 


2. 

Mӽi shénme le? 
~ Mӽi-le yìxiƝ shénme? 

M΁i-le ge táidƝng, m΁i-le 
ge shǀuyƯnjƯ, yì bƟn zìdi΁n… 

What did you buy ~ have you bought? 
What sort of things did you buy ~ have you 
bought? 
[I] bought a lamp, a radio, a dictionary… 
[I] have bought a lamp…. 

8.10.3  Other cases of V-le 
There are also cases in which le intervenes between verb and object where neither the 
notion of sequence nor quantified object clearly applies. Such cases can only be 
accounted for by the more general sense of the function of V-le, as a way of checking off 
the fact that a particular event occurred. In the examples below, the particularity is 
sometimes indicated in the English by the material shown in brackets: ‘my meal’, ‘her 
meal’, rather than just ‘a meal’. Rather than try to apply a rule that is inevitably vague, 
the learner will do better to shíshì-qiúshì  ‘seek truth from facts ([from] real-things seek-
truth)’; study the examples, try to account for the presence of le and its position in the 
sentence, then test your concepts against material that you observe in your own 
interactions. Here are some examples in which the presence of le is probably not 
surprising, but the position directly after the verb, or not, may be harder to account for.
