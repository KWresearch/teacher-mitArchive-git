the largest city in the world 
the most expensive car in the world 
the coldest place in the world 

Chinese uses the expression zhƯyƯ, containing Classical Chinese zhƯ, which in this 
context functions like modern DE, to mean ‘one of’: 

zuì dà de chéngshì zhƯyƯ 
zuì hӽo de Zhǀngguó mӿjiԃ zhƯyƯ 

one of the largest cities in the world 
one of the best Chinese rice wines 

Zhǀngguó shi wԃ ge Ɩnlӿhuì 
chéngyuánguó zhƯyƯ. 

China is one of the 5 permanent member 
states of the Security Council. 

Note 

The Chinese equivalents to what are called acronyms in alphabetic languages (eg 
NATO or WTO) are shortened or ‘telescoped’ phrases. Thus Àolínpӿkè 
Yùndònghuì gets shortened to Àoyùnhuì; Ɩnquán Lӿshì Huì, literally ‘security 
directorship organization’ gets shortened to Ɩnlӿhuì; and Shìjiè Màoyì Zԃzhӿ 
‘World Trade Organization’ gets shortened to Shìmào. 

The same pattern with zhƯyƯ is also the basis of fractions (and percentages):

wԃ fƝn zhƯ èr

8.4.2 Approximately 
Large figures are usually approximate. There are several expressions that may be used to 
indicate that a figure is rough. Chàbuduǀ and dàgài have been used in earlier units, both 
placed before the amount. DàyuƝ ‘about; around; approximately (big-about)’ also appears 
before the amount. Zuԁyòu, on the otherhand, which combines roots for left and right to 
mean ‘more or less’, is placed after the amount. 

Shí Lín zài Kǌnmíng de dǀngbiƗnr,

Notes 

a) Yímín ‘to emigrate (move-people)’; yímíndào ‘to move to [place]’. 

8.4.3  Large numbers 
Apart from the numerals 0 to 9, Chinese also has simple words for five powers of 10: shí 
‘10’, bӽi ‘100’, qiƗn ‘1000’, wàn ’10,000’ and yì ‘100,000,000’. (100 million can also be 
expressed as wànwàn for figures from 100 – 900 million.) Notably missing is ‘million’, 
and it is useful to remember bӽiwàn ‘100 x 10,000’ as ‘million’. Nowadays, large 
numbers are often written out in Arabic numerals, rather than Chinese characters, though 
they are, of course, read out in Chinese. 

One important rule to note is that in stating large numbers, the highest possible 
power of ten is always used: in other words, 1,500 is always expressed in Chinese as 
yìqiƗn wԃbӽi rather than as *shíwԃbӽi. The key to forming large numbers, then, is to keep 
the five basic powers of 10 in mind, and work down from the largest relevant power to 
the smallest. Empty tens and hundreds columns (one or more than one) that are not final 
in the figure are signaled by líng ‘zero’.

(dàlóu) in the world. And so is the Oriental Pearl Tower (DǀngfƗng Míngzhǌ Tӽ); the
    latter is 468 meters tall (pictured below). 
2. Wall Mart (Wò’Črmӽ) is one of the largest companies in the world. 
3. 30% of MIT graduate students are from abroad. 
4. Although everyone in Chinese class has been abroad, about 15% of us have never 
studied a foreign language before.

8.5 Bargaining 
Purchases in China, as in most countries, can be subject to bargaining. This means a 
certain amount of time and engagement, but it also offers a chance for language practice. 
The rules for bargaining are difficult to make explicit, and in any case, outsiders (to say 
nothing of foreigners) cannot really know local prices, so the best to hope for is to get 
within a few percentage points of a good price. Chinese friends will generally say you 
overpaid (tài guì le), but you can respond that you got a free language lesson in return 
(yԁu jƯhuì liànxi Zhǀngwén ‘have opportunity to practice Chinese’)! 

Bargaining for expensive items, jewelry for example, or crafts, is a rather 
different skill from making minor purchases of commodity items. If there is a ‘give’ of a 
few percentage points built into the asking price of fruit or vegetables at your local 
market, or perhaps 10 to 20% in the price of material at your local bazaar, the difference 
between asking price and best price for an expensive item sold in a market, or even in a 
shop, may be 100%, or even 200%, particularly at notorious bargain markets frequented 
by tourists, like the Yӽxiǌ FúzhuƗng Shìchӽng ‘Yaxiu Clothing Market’ in east Beijing, 
or the XiƗngyáng Shìchӽng in Shanghai. Merchants know that if you make an absurdly 
low counter offer of, say 30%, that constitutes a promise, and you are stuck with the 
goods even if you eventually figure out that they are only worth 10% or the original 
asking price. So always respond to the question, ‘What are you willing to pay?’ with the 
counter-question, ‘What is your best price?’. Many people would say that for more 
expensive purchases, best to get help from a local friend. 

For low intensity bargaining, here are some useful phrases to begin with: 

Seeking a reduction
 KƟyƱ shӽo yìdiănr ma? 
Piányi yìdiănr, kƟyƱ ma? 
Néng piányi yìdiӽnr ma?


 

Finding the bottom 
NƱ zuì shӽo duǀshao qián? 
Zuì dƯ de jiàgé shi duǀshao? 

Can you reduce it a bit? 

Can you make it a little cheaper? 


How much is your lowest (‘best’) price? 
What’s your lowest (‘best’) price?

Okay, I’ll give you 85%. 
Okay, I’ll give you 70%.

Okay, that’s fine, I’ll sell [it] to you! 

Okay, can do.


Notes 

a) jiàgé ‘price’; also jiàwèi in southern regions. 

b) dӽ zhékòu, or colloquially, simply dӽ zhé ‘do a discount’. Zhé has a range of 

meanings, from ‘snap’ to ‘fold’, but in combination with dӽ, it means a ‘discount’. 

However, while English typically focuses on the amount of the reduction (‘10% 

off’), Chinese states the resulting discounted price (‘90%’), and it indicates this 

with a numerical modifier before zhé: jiԃ zhé ‘90%’; bƗshíwԃ zhé, ‘85%’. 

c) dČng yixià (ጙሆ) ‘wait for a bit (one time)’; cf. xiǌxi yixià ‘take a break’; kàn

yixià  ‘take a look at’. 

d)  zhuàn ‘earn’  

e)  jìnkԁu ‘import (enter-mouth+of+river)’; cf. §8.5 below. 

f)  With transactional verbs that involve movement away from the possessor, such  

as mài ‘sell’, dì ‘to pass; to forward’, the recipient – the person who ends up with 

the object in question – can be introduced with gČi (often untoned) placed directly 

after the verb: mài gei tƗ ‘sell to him’; dì gei tƗ ‘pass [it] to her’. This makes yet 

another pattern associated with gČi.

Notes 

a) Chinese call ‘pepper’ hújiƗo ‘foreign pepper’. HújiƗo is not used as much in 
Chinese cooking as huƗjiƗo ‘flower pepper’, also called fagara, brown pepper, or 
Sichuan pepper. Unlike the sharp heat of làjiƗo ‘chilies’ which is associated with 
Hunnan cuisine, huƗjiƗo has a slightly numbing effect and, mixed with làjiƗo, is 
characteristic of Sichuan food; cf. Sichuan dishes beginning with mala: eg málà 
Črduo ‘spicy pig-ears’ and málà-jƯsƯ‘spicy shredded chicken’. 
b) Dàn, méiyou wèidao. 
c) Sè is a taste characteristic of shìzi ‘persimmons’ or unripe pears and  peaches 
(shƝng de lí, táozi). 

Zhǀngguó rén shuǀ xƯfƗng cài tài dàn,

is too heavy. Western food, too dull, 
Southern, too heavy, but Chinese is just

8.5.3  Adding or subtracting amounts 
If it’s not salty enough, you put in more salt; if you’ve given too much money, you want 
to take some back. The pattern is as follows – note the contrast with English: 

ADV 

V 

amount

 
duǀ / shӽo

fàng 

amount 

 gČi

Though the pattern also occurs with zӽo ‘early’ and wӽn ‘late’, it is most common with 
duǀ and shӽo, normally SVs, but here filling the adverbial position. Here are some 
relevant verbs: 

gČi

lái 
bring (‘cause to come’)

Duǀ chƯ yìdiӽnr cài!

When only one item is involved, the effect of the duǀ pattern can be achieved 
with zài (zàijiàn de zài [Г]):

And in fact, zài and duǀ can co-occur:

Literally ‘Please have some more food 
again’, but used to mean, ‘Do have some

8.5.4  Cuisines 
Chinese generally distinguish 8 regional cuisines which, for the most part, are named 
after the provinces with which each is primarily associated. These cuisines are often 
signaled on restaurant fronts by using standard regional abbreviations, or ‘alternate 
names’ (biéchƝng) of the relevant provinces: Yuè for Canton, Mӿn for Fújiàn, etc. 
(Abbreviated names of provinces are also used on automobile licence plates and for 
names of regional languages, cf. §8.6 below.)

Exercise 5. 
Provide Chinese for the following: 
1. Sichuan food is hot, but it isn’t as hot as Hunan food; Thai food is even hotter, I feel. 
2. If you prefer a ‘saltier’ taste, put in more soysauce. 

3. I’m not used to eating hot food, so please put fewer chillies in; please don’t cook it too 
spicy. 
4. Lychees are a bit too sweet for me; I prefer plums or peaches. 
5. Durian is cheaper in southern regions than in the north. Durian tastes a bit sour. 
6. Cantonese food tends to be a little sweet, with not much soysauce; Sichuan food is hot 
and ‘numbing’. 
7.  If durian is even a tiny bit overripe [shú], it stinks to high heaven. However, if it’s too 
unripe [shƝng], it doesn’t taste good either.

8.5.5  Banquets and toasts 
Banquets and formal meals, whether in restaurants or elsewhere, are almost always 
served in private rooms, with food brought in from the kitchen. The host generally sits 
fathest from the door to the room, or at home, farthest from the kitchen, with guests 
arranged to his/her left and right, roughly according to rank. Guests seated in a place of 
honor may ritually offer the place to someone of about the same rank before falling into 
line with the host. (A useful expression for resisting such social honors is bùgӽndƗng 
‘not-dare-assume-[it]’, ie ‘I don’t deserve it; you flatter me.’) 

Conversation at banquets is usually light and humorous, with anecdotes, personal 
stories, and often a lot of language play, so that foreigners even of quite advanced 
conversational ability may find it difficult to follow. One subject that can break the ice is 
the food itself – food names, ingredients, regional dishes and differences in Chinese and 
foreign eating habits and cuisines. 

At a banquet or formal meal, there may be several drinks served, including 
mineral water, soft drinks and one or more wines and liquors. While soft drinks may be 
drunk at one’s pleasure, wines and liquor are usually drunk only with toasts, which may 
be made to individuals, or to the whole table. The standard toast of ‘bottoms up’ only 
applied to drinks served in small glasses:

<DàjiƗ> gƗnbƝi, gƗnbƝi! 
Hăo, gƗnbƝi.	
 
 

 

Cheers everyone! (‘dry-cup’) 
Fine, cheers. 

Women will find it easier to resist calls to gƗnbƝi, since many women in China do 
not drink in public. But men of sober character will have develop ways of resisting calls 
to drink with minimum loss of face. The expression suíyì ‘as you please (follow-
intention)’ can help for a while: 

Jiă

YƱ

Lái, lái gƗnbƝi, gƗnbƝi! 
 Wǂ bù néng hƝ, suíyì, suíyì. 
Bù xíng, gƗnbƝi, gƗnbƝi. 
 Hăo, hăo, wǂ suíyì, 
nƱmen gƗnbƝi. 

Come on, bottoms up! 

I can’t drink [it all], [so] at one’s pleasure. 

That won’t do, bottoms up! 

[in jest] Okay, fine, I’ll sip, you swig. 

Other toasts may involve health, cooperation, success, etc. The CV wèi ‘for the sake 
of’, or the verb zhù ‘wish for’ may introduce such toasts. For the actual invitation to 
drink, jƯng nƱmen yì bƝi, literally, ‘respect you a cup’ may be used instead of gƗnbƝi. Here 
are some samples toasts: 

Wèi dàjiƗ de jiànkƗng gƗnbƝi! 
Here’s to everyone’s health! 
Wèi zánmen gòngtóng de shìyè gƗnbƝi!  Here’s to our common cause! 
Wèi nӿmen de xuéxí jìnbù gƗnbƝi!	
Here’s to progress in your studies! 
Wèi wԁmen de hézuò yúkuài gƗnbƝi!	
Zhù nín jiànkƗng, jƯng nƱ yì bƝi!	
A glass to your health! 
Zhù nƱmen chénggǀng, jƯng nƱmen yì bƝi!  A glass to your success! 
JiƗqiáng jiƗoliú, zƝngjìn yԁuyì!	
Strengthen exchanges and promote
friendship! 

Here’s to successful cooperation! 

 

In giving toasts, it is important to raise the glass with two hands; extra deference can 
be shown by raising the glass high (still with two hands). At large gatherings, normally 
the host will toast first, at or near the beginning of the meal, and then later on, the head of 
the guest delegation will return the toast. Where a number of tables are involved, hosts 
and guests may walk over to toast other tables. People will often rise to toast. Possible 
expressions of thanks to the hosts are: 

Xièxie nӿmen de kuӽndài. 

Thank you for the hospitality. 

Xièxie nӿmen de rèqíng zhƗodài!  Thanks for your warm reception! 

At banquets or other meals, Chinese often play very rapid games of huáquán 
‘finger guessing’ or more generally, hƝjiԃ de yóuxì ‘drinking games’, with the loser<s> 
drinking. Such games come in a number of varieties, and need a lot of practice. With

foreigners, the simpler children’s game of ‘scissors, stone, paper’ often substitutes for the 
real thing. That game is called shítou, jiӽnzi, bù (‘stone, scissors, cloth’) in Chinese, and 
participants play by shouting out ‘shítou, jiӽnzi, bù’, displaying their choice on the count 
of ‘bù’. Another game, chóngzi, bàngzi, lӽohԃ, jƯ ‘insect, club, tiger, chicken’, is common 
and simple enough to learn. The rules are: 

Chóngzi chƯ bàngzi, bàngzi dӽ lӽohԃ, lӽohԃ chƯ jƯ, jƯ chƯ chóngzi. 

The cadence is fast, and participants simply utter their choice in unison, adding up wins 
and losses until some previously designated number is reached and losers drink.
