10.1 Feeling ill 
In earlier lessons you encountered the verb juéde ‘to feel’. Here, we expand possible 
answers to the question: Nǐ juéde zěnmeyàng? ‘How do you feel; how are you feeling?’ 
The context is casual rather than the formal answers one might hear in a doctor ’s office. 
First, some vocabulary:

Notes 
 

a) Southerners tend to say tòng instead of téng: tóu / wèi / jiǎo / bèi tòng. 
b) Related to tù, with falling tone, is tǔ with low tone, whose core meaning is 
    ‘spit’ (with an extended meaning of ‘enunciate’ – as in ‘spit out’ words): Qǐng 
    wù suídì tǔtán ‘please [do] not randomly spit’ is a common public health notice.     
    Tù, on the other hand, suggests unintentional evacuation [from the mouth],   
    typically vomiting, but also, as in this case, spitting blood. 
c) Chinese medicines come in many tastes, but even if the taste isn’t nice, it’s not 
    usual to try to disguise it by adding sweet ingredients.

10.1.1  A note on traditional Chinese medicine (Zhōngyī)

Here is a sample interchange that uses terminology from traditional Chinese  
medicine [Zhōngyī]:

Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin  

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

 

 
 

Zhèi liăng tiān méi shíyù, zuǐ lĭ kǔ,  For the past couple of days I’ve lost my 
appetite, and my ears are ringing! 
 
 
 
ěr míng! 

Nĭ kĕnéng shi nèi rè, xūyào chī  
diănr qùhuǒyào, xièxiè huǒ. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 You might have ‘an internal heat’, [you] 
should eat some ‘reduce internal heat’ 
medicine, and ‘discharge’ some heat. 

Hăo, nĭ shuō de yǒu dàolĭ; 
 
wŏ shìshi kàn.  

 
 

Okay, what you say makes sense; I’ll  
try [it]. 

 
 
Exercise 1. Paraphrase in Chinese: 
When I got up this morning I didn’t feel very well. At first, I thought it was because I had 
drunk too much the previous night. So I had a cup of coffee, and then lay down (tǎng) on 
the sofa for a couple of hours. At noon, I ate a bit, but I didn’t have an appetite, my 
stomach was upset, and I had diarrhea. By the afternoon, I realized I had a cold, my head 
ached, and I didn’t have any energy. I took a cab to the hospital, but it was more than an 
hour before I could see a doctor. She gave me some medicine for reducing internal heat 
and told me to rest for a few days. So I did. I’m feeling a lot better now, but I still feel a 
bit dizzy. I guess I need to eat more, and drink more water. 
________________________________________________________________________ 
 
10.2  More on indefinites 
As noted in earlier units, question words in Chinese can also function as indefinites. So 
nǎr may mean ‘where’ or ‘anywhere’; shénme may mean ‘what’ or ‘anything’; and jǐ may 
mean ‘how many’ or ‘many; several’, depending on the context. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10.2.1  Complete exclusion or inclusion 
Complete exclusion or inclusion can be conveyed by placing the indefinite phrase before 
the verb and supporting it by inclusive adverbs such as dōu or yě. Where both options are 
feasible – the plain indefinite and the exclusive/inclusive – then the difference can be 
highlighted by the addition of ‘in particular’ or ‘at all’ (or ‘else’ in some contexts) to the 
English translation, as indicated in the following examples: 
 
a) 
 
 
 

 
Wŏ bú qù nǎr.   
I’m not going anywhere [in particular]. 
Wŏ bù zhǎo shéi. 
 
I’m not looking for anyone [in particular]. 
Wŏ bù xiǎng mǎi shénme. 
I don’t feel like buying anything [in particular]. 
Wŏ méi chī shénme yào. 
I didn’t take any medicine [in particular]. 
Zhōngwén shū, wǒ méiyou   I don’t have many Chinese books. 
jǐ běn. 
Tāmen méiyou duōshao qián. They don’t have much money. 
She’s not that tall. 
 
Tā bù zěnme gāo. 

Wŏ nǎr yĕ bú qù. 
 
Wŏ dào nǎr dōu bú qù. 
Wŏ bú qù nǎr.   
 
Wŏ bú dào nǎr qù. 

I’m not going anywhere [in particular]. 

I’m not going anywhere [at all].

bú pà ma? 

We don’t want to buy anything [at all]. 

We don’t want to buy anything [in particular].  

I’m not afraid of anything [at all]. 
Are you really not afraid of anything [at all]? 

Tā shéi dōu bú pà. 

Tā bǐ shéi dōu gāo.

He’s taller than anyone [else]. 

Any day [at all] is fine. 

No matter how he tries, he can’t sleep. 

Jīntiān de zuòyè zĕnme 
zuò yĕ zuòbuwán. 
 

Nèi ge biān zì, wŏ zĕnme 
xiĕ yĕ xiěbuduì. 
 

No matter how I try, I can’t get today’s  
homework done.  

The character ‘biān’, no matter how I write 
it, I can’t get it right. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10.2.2  Virtual exclusion or inclusion 
Another strategy for indicating near or complete exclusion or inclusion is to cite a small 
amount and then rule even that out: 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Where no particular item suggests itself, then yìdiǎnr can provide the amount: 
 
 
 
Wǒ yìdiǎnr dōu bú lèi / bú è... . 
 
 
 
 

Wǒ yìdiǎnr dōu bú pà.  
 
Wǒ yìdiǎnr dōu bù dǒng. 

I don’t have a cent [to my name]. 
I don’t have a dime [to my name]. 

Wŏ yì fēn qián dōu méiyou. 
Wŏ yì máo yĕ méiyou. 

Tā yì bĕn yĕ méi kàn-guo. 

He’s hasn’t even read one [of them]. 

Tā yì kŏu dōu bù gǎn chī. 

She didn’t dare to eat a bite [of it]. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

I’m not the least bit tired / hungry…. 

I’m not the least bit scared! 

I don’t understand any of it.

10.2.3  Lián…dōu/yě ‘even’ 
Lián has a core meaning of ‘join; link; connect’, but in certain contexts, in conjunction 
with inclusive adverbs such as dōu or yě, it corresponds to English ‘even’. And as such, it 
can serve to support virtual exclusion or inclusion of the type cited above: 
 
 
 
 
In other examples, lián … dōu/yě indicates ‘to a degree that includes even …’: 
 

Wǒ yí fèn qián dōu méiyou. ~ 
Wǒ lián yí fèn qián dōu méiyou! 

I was so tired I forgot my own name! 
[ ~ I’m so tired….] 

[I]’m really busy today – didn’t even have 
time to eat lunch. 

Jīntiān máng+de bùdeliăo, lián 
wŭfàn yĕ méi shíjiān chī. 
 
 
 
Wŏ lèi+de lián zìjĭ de míngzi   
dōu wàng le! 
 
 
 
 
In another common constuction, lián appears with bié shuō ‘to say nothing of’: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Have you been to Huhhot? 
 
Nĭ qù-guo Hūhéhàotè ma? 
Hūhéhàotè?! Bié shuō Hūhéhàotè  Huhhot? I haven’t even been to Beijing, 
le, wŏ lián Bĕijīng dōu méi qù-guo!  to say nothing of Huhhot. 

Nĭ kàn-guo Hóng Lóu Mèng ma?  Have you read Dream of the Red Chamber? 
Hóng Lóu Mèng a! Bié shuō Hóng  Dream of the Red Chamber! I haven’t even 
Lóu Mèng, wŏ lián Hóngsè Niángzǐ  read ‘The Red Detachment of Women’, let  
Jūn yĕ méi kàn-guo! 
 
 
let alone Dream of the Red Chamber! 

 
Note 

Hóng Lóu Mèng, literally ‘Red-Building Dream’, but usually translated as 
‘Dream of the Red Chamber’. Written by Cáo Xuěqín (曹雪芹) at the end of the 
17th century, it is probably the best known of the Chinese classic vernacular 
novels. Hóngsè Niángzǐjūn (红色娘子军) ‘The Red Detachment of Women’ was 
one of the ‘model’ ballets (later a play and a film) from the time of the Cultural 
Revolution. As a ballet, it was performed for President Nixon on his 1972 visit.  

Xiǎng chī shénme jiu chī shénme.  Eat whatever you want. 

 
10.2.4  Paired indefinites. 
A final note: Indefinites often come in pairs, the second referring back to the first: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Xiǎng gēn shéi liáotiān jiu gēn shéi  Talk to whomever you want! 
liáotiān. 

Xiǎng wèn shénme jiu wèn shénme.  Ask whatever you want. 

Xiǎng qù nǎlĭ jiu qù nǎlĭ. 

 

Go wherever you want.

Exercise 2 
Provide Chinese for the following mini-conversations: 
1. 
It’s so hot – I don’t feel like going anywhere [in particular]. 
Nor me, I’m just going to stay home and watch the World Cup. 
2. 
What did you do over the New Year break? 
Absolutely nothing! I got sick and had to stay in bed the whole week. 
3. 
Order whatever you like – it’s my treat (‘I’m inviting’) today! 
You shouldn’t; you treated last time – this time, I’m treating. 
4. 
This is a bright little kid; he does things faster than anyone, and better than anyone! 
That’s my 4th daughter – actually [qíshí] she’s more mischievous than anyone! 
5. 
No matter how I try, I can’t sleep; it’s just too hot. 
Don’t you have airconditioning? 
6. 
Have you been to Burma? 
Burma?!  I haven’t even been to London let alone Burma! 
7. 
We’ll get out at the next intersection, okay? 
I can’t stop [tíng] at the intersection. 
That’s fine – we’ll get out wherever it’s convenient [fāngbiàn].

10.3  Verb Reduplication 
In Chinese, as in other languages, it is sometimes useful to give an impression of 
wariness or nonchalance by suggesting that an action involves a minimum of effort: 
 

Hē yìdiănr chá ba.  
 
Shànglai kànkan ba.    

Have a little tea. 
Come on up and take a look.   

 
 
As the second example shows, one way to achieve this effect is to reduplicate the verb 
(with the repeat untoned). There are a number of other options. With single-syllable verbs, 
such as kàn ‘look’or zuò ‘sit’, yī ‘one’ can be inserted between the verbs, as if to say 
‘look a look’ or ‘sit a sitting’. In this case, yi is untoned, but both iterations of the verb are 
toned: 
 

kàn yi kàn 
zuò yi zuò 
zǒu yi zǒu 

 
 
 

take a look 
sit a bit 
take a walk 

 
 
Much the same effect can be achieved by adding the phrase yixià ‘one time’ instead of 
the second iteration of the verb. So the options are: 
 

 
 

 
Děngdeng! 
 
 
Děng yi děng!  
 
Děng yixià! 
 
 
 
 
 
Two-syllable verbs, such as xiūxi are more restricted. Two-syllable verbs can still 
often be followed by a reiteration. They can also be followed by yixià; but they do not 
accept a medial yī. So for two syllable verbs, the options are: 
 

Hang on! 
Wait a sec.! 
Hold on! 

 

Xiūxi xiūxi ba.  
Xiūxi yixià ba.  

Take a break. 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
 
 

 
 

Wŏ gĕi nĭ jièshao jièshao. 
Wŏ gĕi nĭ jièshao yixià. 

Other common examples: 

Nĭ chángchang ba.  
 
Nĭ cháng yi cháng ba.   
Nĭ cháng yixià ba.  
 

Shuìshui jiào ba.  
Shuì yixià jiào ba. 

 
 

 
Let me introduce you.  

 

 
Have a taste [why don’t you?] 

 

 

 
 
Sleep a bit.   

 

 
 
 

 

Nĭ cāicai ~ cāi yi cāi ~ cāi yixià. 

Nĭ wènwen tā ba. 

 

 

Take a guess.  
 
Why don’t you just ask her.

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

Nĭ de zìdiăn, néng kànkan ma? 

Can I take a look at your dictionary? 

Mōmo ~ mō yi mō ~ mō yixià! 

Feel [this]! 

Certain verbs of cognition and consideration seem especially prone to the 
reduplication patterns: 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
nǐ 

 
Wèi 

 
nǐ 

 

 
 
kăolǜ 
think over; consider 

 
 

xiǎng 
think 
 
Xiān gēn tā tán yi tán.  

 

Zánmen shāngliang shāngliang. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
shāngliang 
discuss; consult 

tán 
talk; chat 

Talk to her first.  

Let’s talk about it.  

 

Let me think it over. 

Ràng wŏ kăolǜ yixià.   

 
 
Kăolǜ, of course, involves a delay or postponement, so it is not surprising that in  
certain contexts, sentences such as the last may serve as an indirect way of denying a 
request – a way of saying ‘no’. There are, of course, other expressions that serve the same 
purpose of delaying a decision, eg: Yǐhòu zài shuō ba ‘Why don’t we talk about it later?’ 
 
 

10.4  An interview with your teacher 
This is an interview with a teacher whose name happens to be Wei (but you can fill in the 
name and particulars of your own teacher). This interview covers a lot of familiar ground 
and serves as a good review for biographical information.  
    
nǐ 

Wèi lǎoshī, néng bù néng wèn nín   Prof. Wei, can [I] ask you a few personal 
jǐ ge gèrén de wèntí?

You may, no problem, what do you want to 
ask? 

I’d like to ask you a few family questions, 
and some questions about your hobbies. 

Of course you can. Go ahead and ask! 

Prof. Wei, you were born in England then? 

Shì a, kěshì wǒ shíwǔ suì jiu lái  
Měiguó le. 

Yes, but at 15, I came to the US.

based on my experiences [there].
