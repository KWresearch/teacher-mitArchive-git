10.1 Feeling ill 
In earlier lessons you encountered the verb juéde ‘to feel’. Here, we expand possible 
answers to the question: Nǐ juéde zěnmeyàng? ‘How do you feel; how are you feeling?’ 
The context is casual rather than the formal answers one might hear in a doctor ’s office. 
First, some vocabulary:

Notes 
 

a) Southerners tend to say tòng instead of téng: tóu / wèi / jiǎo / bèi tòng. 
b) Related to tù, with falling tone, is tǔ with low tone, whose core meaning is 
    ‘spit’ (with an extended meaning of ‘enunciate’ – as in ‘spit out’ words): Qǐng 
    wù suídì tǔtán ‘please [do] not randomly spit’ is a common public health notice.     
    Tù, on the other hand, suggests unintentional evacuation [from the mouth],   
    typically vomiting, but also, as in this case, spitting blood. 
c) Chinese medicines come in many tastes, but even if the taste isn’t nice, it’s not 
    usual to try to disguise it by adding sweet ingredients.

10.1.1  A note on traditional Chinese medicine (Zhōngyī)

Here is a sample interchange that uses terminology from traditional Chinese  
medicine [Zhōngyī]:

Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin  

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

 

 
 

Zhèi liăng tiān méi shíyù, zuǐ lĭ kǔ,  For the past couple of days I’ve lost my 
appetite, and my ears are ringing! 
 
 
 
ěr míng! 

Nĭ kĕnéng shi nèi rè, xūyào chī  
diănr qùhuǒyào, xièxiè huǒ. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 You might have ‘an internal heat’, [you] 
should eat some ‘reduce internal heat’ 
medicine, and ‘discharge’ some heat. 

Hăo, nĭ shuō de yǒu dàolĭ; 
 
wŏ shìshi kàn.  

 
 

Okay, what you say makes sense; I’ll  
try [it]. 

 
 
Exercise 1. Paraphrase in Chinese: 
When I got up this morning I didn’t feel very well. At first, I thought it was because I had 
drunk too much the previous night. So I had a cup of coffee, and then lay down (tǎng) on 
the sofa for a couple of hours. At noon, I ate a bit, but I didn’t have an appetite, my 
stomach was upset, and I had diarrhea. By the afternoon, I realized I had a cold, my head 
ached, and I didn’t have any energy. I took a cab to the hospital, but it was more than an 
hour before I could see a doctor. She gave me some medicine for reducing internal heat 
and told me to rest for a few days. So I did. I’m feeling a lot better now, but I still feel a 
bit dizzy. I guess I need to eat more, and drink more water. 
________________________________________________________________________ 
 
10.2  More on indefinites 
As noted in earlier units, question words in Chinese can also function as indefinites. So 
nǎr may mean ‘where’ or ‘anywhere’; shénme may mean ‘what’ or ‘anything’; and jǐ may 
mean ‘how many’ or ‘many; several’, depending on the context. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10.2.1  Complete exclusion or inclusion 
Complete exclusion or inclusion can be conveyed by placing the indefinite phrase before 
the verb and supporting it by inclusive adverbs such as dōu or yě. Where both options are 
feasible – the plain indefinite and the exclusive/inclusive – then the difference can be 
highlighted by the addition of ‘in particular’ or ‘at all’ (or ‘else’ in some contexts) to the 
English translation, as indicated in the following examples: 
 
a) 
 
 
 

 
Wŏ bú qù nǎr.   
I’m not going anywhere [in particular]. 
Wŏ bù zhǎo shéi. 
 
I’m not looking for anyone [in particular]. 
Wŏ bù xiǎng mǎi shénme. 
I don’t feel like buying anything [in particular]. 
Wŏ méi chī shénme yào. 
I didn’t take any medicine [in particular]. 
Zhōngwén shū, wǒ méiyou   I don’t have many Chinese books. 
jǐ běn. 
Tāmen méiyou duōshao qián. They don’t have much money. 
She’s not that tall. 
 
Tā bù zěnme gāo. 

Wŏ nǎr yĕ bú qù. 
 
Wŏ dào nǎr dōu bú qù. 
Wŏ bú qù nǎr.   
 
Wŏ bú dào nǎr qù. 

I’m not going anywhere [in particular]. 

I’m not going anywhere [at all].

bú pà ma? 

We don’t want to buy anything [at all]. 

We don’t want to buy anything [in particular].  

I’m not afraid of anything [at all]. 
Are you really not afraid of anything [at all]? 

Tā shéi dōu bú pà. 

Tā bǐ shéi dōu gāo.

He’s taller than anyone [else]. 

Any day [at all] is fine. 

No matter how he tries, he can’t sleep. 

Jīntiān de zuòyè zĕnme 
zuò yĕ zuòbuwán. 
 

Nèi ge biān zì, wŏ zĕnme 
xiĕ yĕ xiěbuduì. 
 

No matter how I try, I can’t get today’s  
homework done.  

The character ‘biān’, no matter how I write 
it, I can’t get it right. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10.2.2  Virtual exclusion or inclusion 
Another strategy for indicating near or complete exclusion or inclusion is to cite a small 
amount and then rule even that out: 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Where no particular item suggests itself, then yìdiǎnr can provide the amount: 
 
 
 
Wǒ yìdiǎnr dōu bú lèi / bú è... . 
 
 
 
 

Wǒ yìdiǎnr dōu bú pà.  
 
Wǒ yìdiǎnr dōu bù dǒng. 

I don’t have a cent [to my name]. 
I don’t have a dime [to my name]. 

Wŏ yì fēn qián dōu méiyou. 
Wŏ yì máo yĕ méiyou. 

Tā yì bĕn yĕ méi kàn-guo. 

He’s hasn’t even read one [of them]. 

Tā yì kŏu dōu bù gǎn chī. 

She didn’t dare to eat a bite [of it]. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

I’m not the least bit tired / hungry…. 

I’m not the least bit scared! 

I don’t understand any of it.

10.2.3  Lián…dōu/yě ‘even’ 
Lián has a core meaning of ‘join; link; connect’, but in certain contexts, in conjunction 
with inclusive adverbs such as dōu or yě, it corresponds to English ‘even’. And as such, it 
can serve to support virtual exclusion or inclusion of the type cited above: 
 
 
 
 
In other examples, lián … dōu/yě indicates ‘to a degree that includes even …’: 
 

Wǒ yí fèn qián dōu méiyou. ~ 
Wǒ lián yí fèn qián dōu méiyou! 

I was so tired I forgot my own name! 
[ ~ I’m so tired….] 

[I]’m really busy today – didn’t even have 
time to eat lunch. 

Jīntiān máng+de bùdeliăo, lián 
wŭfàn yĕ méi shíjiān chī. 
 
 
 
Wŏ lèi+de lián zìjĭ de míngzi   
dōu wàng le! 
 
 
 
 
In another common constuction, lián appears with bié shuō ‘to say nothing of’: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Have you been to Huhhot? 
 
Nĭ qù-guo Hūhéhàotè ma? 
Hūhéhàotè?! Bié shuō Hūhéhàotè  Huhhot? I haven’t even been to Beijing, 
le, wŏ lián Bĕijīng dōu méi qù-guo!  to say nothing of Huhhot. 

Nĭ kàn-guo Hóng Lóu Mèng ma?  Have you read Dream of the Red Chamber? 
Hóng Lóu Mèng a! Bié shuō Hóng  Dream of the Red Chamber! I haven’t even 
Lóu Mèng, wŏ lián Hóngsè Niángzǐ  read ‘The Red Detachment of Women’, let  
Jūn yĕ méi kàn-guo! 
 
 
let alone Dream of the Red Chamber! 

 
Note 

Hóng Lóu Mèng, literally ‘Red-Building Dream’, but usually translated as 
‘Dream of the Red Chamber’. Written by Cáo Xuěqín (曹雪芹) at the end of the 
17th century, it is probably the best known of the Chinese classic vernacular 
novels. Hóngsè Niángzǐjūn (红色娘子军) ‘The Red Detachment of Women’ was 
one of the ‘model’ ballets (later a play and a film) from the time of the Cultural 
Revolution. As a ballet, it was performed for President Nixon on his 1972 visit.  

Xiǎng chī shénme jiu chī shénme.  Eat whatever you want. 

 
10.2.4  Paired indefinites. 
A final note: Indefinites often come in pairs, the second referring back to the first: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Xiǎng gēn shéi liáotiān jiu gēn shéi  Talk to whomever you want! 
liáotiān. 

Xiǎng wèn shénme jiu wèn shénme.  Ask whatever you want. 

Xiǎng qù nǎlĭ jiu qù nǎlĭ. 

 

Go wherever you want.

Exercise 2 
Provide Chinese for the following mini-conversations: 
1. 
It’s so hot – I don’t feel like going anywhere [in particular]. 
Nor me, I’m just going to stay home and watch the World Cup. 
2. 
What did you do over the New Year break? 
Absolutely nothing! I got sick and had to stay in bed the whole week. 
3. 
Order whatever you like – it’s my treat (‘I’m inviting’) today! 
You shouldn’t; you treated last time – this time, I’m treating. 
4. 
This is a bright little kid; he does things faster than anyone, and better than anyone! 
That’s my 4th daughter – actually [qíshí] she’s more mischievous than anyone! 
5. 
No matter how I try, I can’t sleep; it’s just too hot. 
Don’t you have airconditioning? 
6. 
Have you been to Burma? 
Burma?!  I haven’t even been to London let alone Burma! 
7. 
We’ll get out at the next intersection, okay? 
I can’t stop [tíng] at the intersection. 
That’s fine – we’ll get out wherever it’s convenient [fāngbiàn].

10.3  Verb Reduplication 
In Chinese, as in other languages, it is sometimes useful to give an impression of 
wariness or nonchalance by suggesting that an action involves a minimum of effort: 
 

Hē yìdiănr chá ba.  
 
Shànglai kànkan ba.    

Have a little tea. 
Come on up and take a look.   

 
 
As the second example shows, one way to achieve this effect is to reduplicate the verb 
(with the repeat untoned). There are a number of other options. With single-syllable verbs, 
such as kàn ‘look’or zuò ‘sit’, yī ‘one’ can be inserted between the verbs, as if to say 
‘look a look’ or ‘sit a sitting’. In this case, yi is untoned, but both iterations of the verb are 
toned: 
 

kàn yi kàn 
zuò yi zuò 
zǒu yi zǒu 

 
 
 

take a look 
sit a bit 
take a walk 

 
 
Much the same effect can be achieved by adding the phrase yixià ‘one time’ instead of 
the second iteration of the verb. So the options are: 
 

 
 

 
Děngdeng! 
 
 
Děng yi děng!  
 
Děng yixià! 
 
 
 
 
 
Two-syllable verbs, such as xiūxi are more restricted. Two-syllable verbs can still 
often be followed by a reiteration. They can also be followed by yixià; but they do not 
accept a medial yī. So for two syllable verbs, the options are: 
 

Hang on! 
Wait a sec.! 
Hold on! 

 

Xiūxi xiūxi ba.  
Xiūxi yixià ba.  

Take a break. 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
 
 

 
 

Wŏ gĕi nĭ jièshao jièshao. 
Wŏ gĕi nĭ jièshao yixià. 

Other common examples: 

Nĭ chángchang ba.  
 
Nĭ cháng yi cháng ba.   
Nĭ cháng yixià ba.  
 

Shuìshui jiào ba.  
Shuì yixià jiào ba. 

 
 

 
Let me introduce you.  

 

 
Have a taste [why don’t you?] 

 

 

 
 
Sleep a bit.   

 

 
 
 

 

Nĭ cāicai ~ cāi yi cāi ~ cāi yixià. 

Nĭ wènwen tā ba. 

 

 

Take a guess.  
 
Why don’t you just ask her.

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

Nĭ de zìdiăn, néng kànkan ma? 

Can I take a look at your dictionary? 

Mōmo ~ mō yi mō ~ mō yixià! 

Feel [this]! 

Certain verbs of cognition and consideration seem especially prone to the 
reduplication patterns: 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
nǐ 

 
Wèi 

 
nǐ 

 

 
 
kăolǜ 
think over; consider 

 
 

xiǎng 
think 
 
Xiān gēn tā tán yi tán.  

 

Zánmen shāngliang shāngliang. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
shāngliang 
discuss; consult 

tán 
talk; chat 

Talk to her first.  

Let’s talk about it.  

 

Let me think it over. 

Ràng wŏ kăolǜ yixià.   

 
 
Kăolǜ, of course, involves a delay or postponement, so it is not surprising that in  
certain contexts, sentences such as the last may serve as an indirect way of denying a 
request – a way of saying ‘no’. There are, of course, other expressions that serve the same 
purpose of delaying a decision, eg: Yǐhòu zài shuō ba ‘Why don’t we talk about it later?’ 
 
 

10.4  An interview with your teacher 
This is an interview with a teacher whose name happens to be Wei (but you can fill in the 
name and particulars of your own teacher). This interview covers a lot of familiar ground 
and serves as a good review for biographical information.  
    
nǐ 

Wèi lǎoshī, néng bù néng wèn nín   Prof. Wei, can [I] ask you a few personal 
jǐ ge gèrén de wèntí?

You may, no problem, what do you want to 
ask? 

I’d like to ask you a few family questions, 
and some questions about your hobbies. 

Of course you can. Go ahead and ask! 

Prof. Wei, you were born in England then? 

Shì a, kěshì wǒ shíwǔ suì jiu lái  
Měiguó le. 

Yes, but at 15, I came to the US.

10.5  Minor Constructions 

10.5.1  Chúle … yǐwài  
Chúle…yǐwài means literally ‘having removed…and put aside’, hence ‘besides; except 
for; other than’. The clause following will generally contain an inclusive adverb, such as 
dōu, yě, or hái. In more formal contexts, yǐwài can be rendered as zhī wài, with the 
Classical Chinese particle zhī. (Cf. zhī yī ‘one of’ and zhīqián, the formal alternative to 
yǐqián ‘before’.) Sometimes, either the first part of the expression (chúle) or the second 
(yǐwài) will be omitted.

Exercise 3 
Explain that although things are getting more and more expensive, people (rénmen) are 
also earning (zhuàn) more and more money. Take fruit: in the past people used to eat 
water melons in the spring and apples in the fall. That was it. Occasionally there were 
also bananas or oranges. But except for those, you couldn’t find any other fruit, and 
couldn’t afford to buy any other fruit. But now, the situation (qíngxing) is quite different. 
Now you can buy oranges and bananas in the winter. But they are much more expensive 
than in the past. When I was a child, we used to pay about 90 cents for a bunch (M 
chuàn) of bananas. Now you pay RMB 4-5. But the more expensive they are, they more 
they sell! It’s amazing. 
________________________________________________________________________ 
 

10.6  Xiēhòuyǔ, a form of word play 
An expression in the last section, bú bìyào de shǒuxù, conjures up a pungent example of a 
class of Chinese word play known as xiēhòuyǔ. Xiēhòuyǔ consist of two parts: the first 
part, which is stated, poses a riddle; the second part, which is usually not stated, answers 
it. But the creativity of the xiēhòuyǔ comes from the fact that the unstated anwer requires 
further interpretation for it to apply to the situation. Here are a few examples: 
 
 
 
 

implied 

stated   

 

 

 

unstated

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

Tuō kùzi fàng pì 
> 
remove trousers put fart 

bú bìyào de shǒuxù. 
unnecessary DE procedures  > red tape 

And the more earthy example suggested by the earlier phrase: 
 
 
 
 
While it is useful to know about xiēhòuyǔ, using them in speech would suggest a level of 
language use that would be hard for anybody but the most advanced students to sustain. 
In some ways, xiēhòuyǔ, like proverbs or sayings, can be mastered just like any other 
vocabulary, by observing – or being told – actual usage and then trying them out warily. 
However, they are used sparingly in ordinary conversation – particularly to foreigners – 
and so in the foundation stages of study, it is enough to be aware of them, and collect 
other examples from Chinese friends – who are usually delighted to talk about the 
subject.  
 

10.7 Religion 
Though the official line in China is that religions are superstition (míxìn, which means, 
literally, ‘confused belief’), nowadays some religious activity is tolerated, provided it 
does not show potential for threatening the power of the state. Chinese, knowing that 
formal religion plays a more prominent role in the life of many foreigners, will often ask 
about religious affiliation. 
 

 
 
 

What’s your religion? 
I’m Buddhist. (‘Buddhism-follower’) 
I don’t have a religion.

b) tú ‘disciple; follower’, a bound form; as noted, tú is not used for followers of 
all religions.

c) Moslems are considered a minority group (shǎoshù mínzú) in China – the only 
minority group defined in terms of religion. 
d) While ordinary people in Chinese know about Tiānzhǔjiào, there is often some 
confusion about the difference between Jīdūjiào and Xīnjiào. 
e) It is often argued that Taoism (Dàojiào) and Buddhism operate syncretically, ie 
within a single system. In ordinary speech, people often identify themselves – or 
others – as Fójiàotú, or xìn Fójiào de, but not xìn Dàojiào de.  
f) Because of their importance in US history, the Puritans, Qīnqjiàotú ‘clear-
religion-followers’, are also well known in China.

10.8 Verb Combos (4) 
Students of English know the difficulty of dealing with its vast repertoire of ‘phrasal 
verbs’: check in, check out, check up; or pick on, pick off, pick up, pick out. The second 
element of these combinations is a directional particle; but the meaning of the whole is 
often not easily deduced from its component parts. In other words, many are idiomatic. In 
Chinese, verb-combos present much the same problem. While some are transparent 
(náguòqu), others are harder to derive from the elements involved (mǎibuqǐ). For this 
reason, they have been introduced incrementally. This section introduces a few more 
idiosyncratic sets. 
 
 
10.8.1  –xiàlai 
Verbs of recording or notation are completed by the directional complement xiàlai, 
roughly corresponding to ‘down’ in English. The relevant verbs are: 
 
 

 

lù 
 
zhào 
record  photograph 

huà 
 
draw; paint 

miáo 
trace 

xiě 
 
bèi 
jì 
write  note  memorize 

 
 
Usage 
   1.  Qǐng bǎ tā xiěxiàlai. 

 

 

Shuō màn yìdiănr, wŏ jìbuxiàlai.  
 
 
 

   2.

I didn’t hear clearly, did you get it down? 

Yes, I did, look.  
Er, I can’t read it. 
I didn’t write the characters very well. 

What they’re saying is fascinating; we 
should record it.  
 
It would be best if we traced that map. 

   5.  Wǒmen zuì hǎo bǎ nèi zhāng   
 
dìtú miáoxiàlai. 
 
10.8.2 – chūlai 
Chūlai, with the literal meaning of ‘come out’, combines with verbs of perception to 
mean ‘figure out; recognize’: 
 

Yīnwèi tā de màozi, wŏ bǎ tā   
rènchūlai le.  [rènshi] 

I recognized him by his hat.

10.8.3 Moving out 
Hǎi Bó is trying to get in touch with his friend Xǔ Chángdé. But when he phones his 
apartment, the woman who answers doesn’t know where he is. Note how the selection of 
particular verb complements can modify the verb bān ‘move’. 
 
Hǎi  Wei, qǐng zhǎo Xǔ Chángdé ji 
diànhuà. 
 
 
 

Hello, may I speak to Xǔ Chángdé?

a) Wei is an interjection, used to open a telephone conversation, or call out to 
someone.  
b) Qǐng zhǎo X jiē diànhuà is the conventional way of asking to speak to 
someone, literally ‘invite find X connect phone’. 
c) Běn yuè chū, literally ‘root month beginning’, ie ‘at the beginning of the 
current month’; cf. běn yuè dǐ ‘at the end of the month’. 

 
 

10.9  Transformations (with chéng) 
Since learning a language inevitably involves errors of perception or translation, such 
expressions involving transformations will be useful. Some are formed with chéng, itself 
a verb meaning ‘become’ (cf. chéng le yí ge shén ‘became a spirit’ in the ‘temple’ – 
dialogue in Unit 9). Added to compatible verbs, chéng introduces a ‘transform’ – the 
product of a transformation. Frequently, the ‘thing transformed’ is marked by bǎ. Here 
are examples: 
 

Tā bǎ zhuā nèi ge zì xiěchéng  
zhǎo le.  
 
 
 

She has written the character zhua (抓) 
as zhao (爪). 

 

19

Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin

She pronounced the word xihuan as xiwang. 

He read the characters shuai (甩) as yong 
(用). 

Tā bǎ shuǎi nèi ge zì kànchéng  
yòng le.  
 
 
 
 
Tā bǎ xĭhuan nèi ge cí shuōchéng 
xīwàng le.  
 
Qǐng bāng wŏ bǎ zhèi jǐ ge jùzi  
fānyìchéng Yīngwén.   
 
 
 
Interestingly, standard transliterations of the two hotels (fàndiàn), the Hilton and 
the Sheraton, are very similar in Chinese. The first is Xī’ěrdùn; the second is Xièlādùn (at 
least in one of its renditions). It is easy to hear one as the other: 
 

Please help me translate these sentences 
into English. 

Nǐ shuō Xī’ěrdùn, wǒ bǎ tā 
tīngchéng Xièlādùn le! 

 
 

[When] you said ‘Hilton’, I heard 
it as Sheraton.  

 
 
Exercise 4. Provide translations for: 
1. We often translate duìbuqǐ as ‘sorry’, but actually, it’s not quite the same. 
2. You can’t call ‘good’ ‘bad’, or ‘bad’ ‘good’. 
3. His book has been translated into Chinese. 
4. First year students often read 也 as 他, or 找 as 我. 
5. My driver heard Sheraton as Hilton, so I ended up staying far from the office. 
 

10.10 Bèi ‘by’ 
In English, a sentence such as ‘The police arrested them’ can be recast, for various 
rhetorical reasons, as ‘they were arrested by the police’, or ‘they got arrested by the 
police’. The agent can be stated, using the preposition ‘by’; or it can be omitted: ‘They 
were ~ got arrested’. Sometimes the agent is unknown; at other times, there are reasons 
not to state the agent – avoiding responsibility, for example. In many languages, the shift 
from starting with the agent (the police) to starting with the ‘patient’ (the people 
arrested), and the consequent changes to the verb (‘arrested > was/got arrested’) are 
characterized by the terms ‘active’ to ‘passive’.  
 
Chinese verbs, as we have seen, are uncommitted to many of the categories that 
 
are taken for granted in English and many European languages: tense, person (she sings, 
they sing), and passive too. In many cases – perhaps most cases – where English has a 
passive, Chinese is noncommittal and simply lets the context determine how a particular 
noun relates to the verb. The following pair of Chinese sentences are structurally 
identical; yet in most contexts, the first is translated by an English passive, the second by 
an active: 
 
 
 
 

Nín zěnme chēnghu?   
 
 
 
 
Nín zěnme yòng? 
 

How [should] you be addressed? 

How do you use [this]?

Jǐngchá bǎ tāmen zhuāqǐlai le.  
The police arrested them. 
Tāmen bèi <jǐngchá> zhuāqǐlai le.   They got arrested <by the police>. 

 
However, there are cases in Chinese which do bear a resemblance to what in 
European tradition has been referred to as passive voice. These involve the word bèi (or 
one of several other words whose function is nearly synonymous with bèi). The pair of 
sentences below (utilizing the verb zhuā ‘arrest; seize’) illustrate: 
 
 
 
 
In both languages, agent and ‘patient’ – person affected – are rearranged so as to make 
the patient the starting point. While in the Chinese, bèi cannot be omitted, its object, 
jǐngchá, can be. (In the English example, ‘by the police’ can be omitted, but not just ‘the 
police’.) It is noteworthy, however, that the verb in Chinese undergoes no modification – 
it is zhuā in both cases (cf. English ‘arrested’ but ‘got arrested’). However, under some 
conditions – and perhaps more often in some regions than others – the Chinese verb can 
be modified by the addition of gěi (‘give’ in one of its diverse functions) before the verb. 
 
 
 

Tāmen <bèi jǐngchá> gěi zhuāqǐlai le. They got arrested <by the police>. 

His bike got sold by [my] aunt. 

Tā de zìxíngchē bèi bómŭ 
mài le.  
O, nà tài kĕxī le. 
Oh, what a pity. 
 
 
Tā shuō qí zìxíngchē tài wēixiăn le!  She said that riding bikes was too 
 
 
 
 
 
dangerous.  

The addition of gěi may add an additional nuance of commiseration or regret. 
(The use of ‘got’ in English, rather than the more neutral ‘have been’, may serve the same 
purpose.) The possibility of adding gěi to the verb makes the structural comparison 
between English and Chinese more compelling. But regardless of the structural 
similarities, bèi, like its active counterpart bǎ, has certain conditions attached to it which 
makes the Chinese construction with bèi much less common that English passives. In 
most cases – not all – bèi (and its counterparts) only appear with actions which have an 
adverse effect: with things breaking, being lost or stolen, damaged, etc.

10.10.1. Other options,  with gěi, jiào, ràng 
It is worth noting that there are alternatives to bèi, some of them more colloquial: jiào, 
ràng,and gěi (yet again). Unlike bèi, they all have other functions: ràng ‘let’; jiào ‘call’; 
gěi ‘give; for’. Ràng and jiào require an object, even if a ‘dummy’ rén; but gěi, like bèi, 
does not.  
 
 
 
 
 
 

Zìxíngchē bèi <rén> <gěi> tōu le.  
Zìxíngchē gěi <rén> <gěi> tōu le. 
Zìxíngchē jiào rén <gěi> tōu le.  
Zìxíngchē ràng rén <gěi> tōu le.  

[My] bike got stolen by someone.  

No doubt you have marveled at the versatility of the word gěi, which occurs as a 
main verb (‘give’) as a CV (‘for [the benefit of]’), as an alternative to bèi ‘by’, and as a 
signal of the passive turn in the verb (gěi tōu le). Yes, it is possible to find a single 
sentence containing several gěi’s in different functions; and yes, at times there is 
ambiguity. But all this is new, and for now, we should focus on the options that are the 
least problematical – the bèi options. Below are some examples and dialogues that 
encapsulate what needs to be learned at this point.  
 
10.10.2  What happened? 
Since bèi sentences tend to involve comment on misfortunes, questions that express 
curiosity about events provide a typical lead in:

Some Americans think that Tibet

Really! 

Have a cigarette. 

 Xièxie, wǒ bu chōuyān. 

No thanks, I don’t smoke. 

Exercise 6 
Explain that American beer is more expensive than Chinese beer, but that Chinese still 
buy it. Budweiser, called Bǎiwēi in China, is getting more and more popular (pǔbiàn). 
Explain that you don’t think it has as much flavor as Chinese brands like Qīngdǎo, 
Shànghǎi or Yànjīng. So you always tell your Chinese friends that they should drink 
Chinese brands, not imports! The same with cigarets. Chinese pay attention to [zhòngshì 
(‘heavy-view)’] brands. American brands are well known, so they buy American brands. 
They say that, in any case, American cigarets are stronger than Chinese cigarets and they 
taste better. I can’t believe this is really the case!

<If> friends give you cigarettes, 
how can you not smoke? 

Good, although it’s not good  
for me, I still have to smoke. 

Right, smoking’s not good, 
it’s not good for you[r body]. 

Péngyou gěi nǐ yān,

Do Chinese all smoke? 

Fine, fine, no problem.

10.14  Vivid SVs (of the form SVxx) 
In earlier units, you have seen vivid adjectives formed from SV roots and repeated 
syllables: huáliūliū; huīméngméng (~ mēng). While some of the repeated syllables can be 
matched with some confidence to independent words (eg bīng ‘ice’ in lěngbīngbīng), for 
others, the only indication of their source comes from the characters used to write them, 
and these may have been chosen for their sound rather than their meaning. The repeated 
sī in làsīsī ‘hot; peppery’ is written with the character usually used for ‘silk’; lāsūsū, 
which has much the same meaning, contains the repeated syllable sū, written with the 
character for ‘crisp’. It is hard to see what contribution these words make to the meaning 
of the whole, other than filling out the pattern. 
 
 
Most of the repeated syllables are level-toned. A number of them show variation, 
probably due to the influence of the usual tone of the character chosen for the second 

 

33

Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin  

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

syllable. The teng of rèténgténg for example, is often pronounced with a level tone even 
though pedantic speakers are likely to argue, on the basis of the character 腾 which in 
other contexts is pronounced with rising tone, that rising (and not level) is the ‘correct’ 
tone. However, there are a few cases where the tone of the repeated syllable clearly is not 
level, eg kōngdàngdàng. 
 

Vivid SVs of this type have certain grammatical properties that set them apart 
from ordinary SVs. They cannot be modified by ‘adverbs of degree’ such as hěn or tài, 
for example. Typically, they act as modifiers connected to nouns by a following de; or 
they stand alone (still with following de) as commentaries; cf. examples below. 
 
The list below gives an indication of the range of vivid SVs; the meaning of the 
root SV is given in parentheses.

Exercise 8. 
Provide a Chinese paraphrase: 
What you say about the situation in China is very interesting. Here in the U.S, telephone 
calls also used to be quite expensive – especially long-distance ones (chángtú); but not 
anymore. I still often write letters to my relatives, but that’s because they’re older and 
they still like to read letters. Sending a letter is still pretty inexpensive - only about 40 
cents within the country; a letter to China is about 80 cents airmail. But students 
nowadays all have computers, so we prefer to send email. Often, I don’t know enough 
characters to write what I want to say in Chinese; and in any case, I have trouble sending 
characters. So I write pinyin and as long as I write words, my Chinese friends seem to be 
able to read it. I don’t write the tones (sìshēng) either, since that takes too long and 
what’s more, it makes it too messy to read. Almost all my friends have cellphones; with 
the new ones, you can surf the web, take photos or listen to music. They’re kind of

a) Yíhuìr ~ yìhuǐr (the latter pronunciation is more colloquial) ‘awhile’ 
b) Shāo<wēi> ‘slightly; for a bit’; (Wēiruǎn de wēi); hotel telephone operators in 
China tend to say qǐng shāo děng when they transfer your call.  
c) Mǎshàng ‘immediately; at once’, literally ‘on a horse’; synonymous with lìkè. 
d) Huì indicates a degree of probability.

from news agents and other small shops in China. In China, these are usually sold 
below face value; a RMB 100 card might go for RMB 30. (Dǎ zhé ma? ‘Do you 
allow a discount?’) Some are local (dìqū yòng de); others can be used throughout 
China (quánguó yòng de) or even internationally (guójì de).

Notes 

 

a) Wèi is an exclamation used to hail people at a distance, or confirm a telephone 
connection. Though its tone is marked as falling in dictionaries, its actual pitch 
varies with context. 
b) Qĭng zhǎo [person] jiē diànhuà ‘please get […] to come to the phone’ is in fact 
a request to speak to a person (~ ‘may I speak to […]’) and reflects the fact that 
before cellphones, telephones were often outside of residences and people had to 
be hailed or fetched from some distance away. 
 
 
 

Wei?

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 

 

 

Hello? 

Just (wait) a minute please, I’ll go 
and find him....Zhou, it’s for you!

~ Hello, is that Zhōu Yǔ?

~ Hello, is Zhou there?] 

10.18  Chinese etiquette   
Shěn Fēipéng, a teacher from Belgium, makes a phone call to his Chinese friend, Zhōu 
Yǔ, to ask a question about Chinese etiquette. Zhōu’s wife (Tt) answers the phone.

Okay, thanks. …Hello, who’s that? 
 
  
I’m Shen Feipeng. 

It’s like this: someone’s invited me  
for a meal; should I bring them a 
present? 

Now that depends on the situation 
and the place.  

Zhou, can I ask you a question 
about Chinese customs? 

Oh, Feiping, how are you. 
What’s up? 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
 

Sure! 

 

 

 

Shi ge tóngshì, wŏmen xiāngdāng shú.

In that case, you can take a bunch 
of fresh flowers or some fruit. No 
need to spend a lot of money.  
‘It’s the thought.’ 
 
 
 
Okay, it’s spring, I’ll buy a bunch 
of flowers.  

Flowers are fine! (‘suitable’) 

Many thanks! (‘very grateful’) 
You’re welcome.  
Okay, that’s it then. Bye.  

a) Notice that in conventional usage, Chinese generally makes use of the first and 
second person pronouns in expressions like Nǐ shi shéi? and Wǒ shi Shěn 
Fēipéng, while English prefers ‘it’ or ‘this’: ‘Who is it? / This is Shěn Fēipéng.’ 
Similarly: Qǐng zhǎo Zhōu Yǔ jiē diànhuà. / Wǒ jiùshi. ‘May I speak to Zhou Yu? 
/ This is he. ~ Speaking.’ 
b) The word huā has a number of senses, including ‘flowers; blossoms’ (yí shù 
huā), ‘design’ (huāyàng ‘design; pattern’); and ‘to spend’ (huā qián), possibly 
following a semantic course from ‘flower’ to ‘ornament’, from ‘ornament’ to 
‘waste or dissipation’, and from there to ‘expense’. Contrast huà ‘change’. 
c) Biǎoshi ge yìsi, literally ‘to express a meaning’, ie ‘as a token [of friendship, 
affection, etc.]’ 

 
10.18.1 Gifts 
There are a number of conventional remarks associated with the giving and receiving of 
gifts. For larger gifts for example, the host might say: Tài pòfèi le! ‘[You] spent too much 
[money]’, using the expression pòfèi ‘squander money (break-expense)’. On presenting 
such a present, the guest might say, with modesty: Xiǎo yìsi. ‘Just a token (small 
meaning).’ However, bringing some fruit or flowers as an expression of thanks (much as 
Americans and Europeans might bring a bottle of wine) usually elicits more perfunctory 
remarks along the following lines: 
 
i) 

I’ve brought you a bunch of flowers. 
How pretty! ‘You shouldn’t have.’ 

 
Gĕi nĭ dàilai yí shù huā! 
Zhēn piàoliang. Nĭ tài kèqi le.  

 
ii) 

 

Dàilai yìdiănr shuǐguǒ, dàjiā yìqĭ  
chī.  
Nĭ tài kèqi le.   
 
 
 
 

 

 

I’ve brought some fruit for everyone.  

You shouldn’t have.

Appendix:  Body parts 
 
Core body parts, as opposed to figurative extensions (eg ‘He’s the brains of the 
operation’) might seem to be well-demarcated notions that would translate easily from 
language to language; but in fact, though their core meanings correspond fairly well, their 
connotations may be quite different. This is particularly true of the internal organs, where 
in Chinese, for example, xīngānr, ‘heart’ and ‘liver ’ is a term of affection (fùmǔ de 
xīngān bǎobèi ‘parents’ darling treasure’); where (at least in some regions) xīncháng 
‘heart’ and ‘intestine’ is, roughly, ‘in the mood for ’ (méiyou xīncháng qù kàn diànyǐngr); 
and where fèifǔ ‘lungs’ and ‘bowels’ means ‘from the bottom of one’s heart’ (fèifǔ zhī 
yán ‘words from the bottom of one’s heart’). 
 
The following list is not exhaustive. You may want to add to it, with specialized words 
such as ‘temple’, ‘forehead’ or ‘calf ’. In addition, you should check regional and local 
variation (pronunciation as well as root), and observe usage and metaphorical extensions.
