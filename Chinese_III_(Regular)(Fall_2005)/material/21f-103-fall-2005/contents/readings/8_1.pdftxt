Notes 

a) Xichang is a city in the ‘Great Snowy Mountains’ in the southern part of 
Sichuan. It is now best known for the satellite launch and tracking facilities which 
are some 50 kms from the town; but historically, it is also an important center of 
the Yi people (also called Nasu and Norsu).

[Over] winter break, first I went 
home to visit my family. After a 
week there, I went to Taipeh for a 
meeting. I only stayed 3 days in 
Taipeh [so] I didn’t have time to 
see a lot of places. Next year, I want 
to go back once again to get to know 
more about Taiwanese culture, see 
more of TáiwƗn’s scenery, and to eat 
more Taiwanese snacks. That’s the 
reason that right now I’m thinking of 
how I can raise the level of my
Chinese some more, and earn more 
money. That way after I get to 
Taipeh, I’ll be able to speak
Mandarin to the people in Taiwan.

Exercise 1 
a) Prepare narratives along the following lines: 

1. Itinerary: Arrived in Shanghai at 5:30 pm; got the #4 bus to the Shanghai train station. 
Planned to take the subway to the hotel on ZhàojiƗbƗng Road; tired, lots of luggage; so, 
took a cab. Later on, moved once again to a hotel in Zhá BČi near the train station; that 
way, it’s easier to get to the airport. 

2. Daily schedule: Generally get up at 7:30, shower and have some rice gruel; bike to 
Beijing Yԃyán Dàxué for 10 o’clock class; at noon, eat lunch in the cafeteria with 
classmates; 1:00 to 3:00, two more classes; after class, off to the library to study. Usually 
eat dinner at a local restaurant. Sometimes, in the evening we go into town or hang out at 
bars and coffee shops; don’t get home until quite late. 

3. Over the New Year, I spent a few days with friends in Guilin, then went on to 
Kunming by train. Originally I had planned to visit Dàlӿ and LìjiƗng in the northwest of 
Yúnnán as well, but I didn’t feel well, so I just stayed in Kǌnmíng at the Camellia Hotel 
(sic) (CháhuƗ BƯnguӽn), wrote letters and rested. Later on, visited the Stone Forest (Shí 
Lín) and Zhèng Hé ’s tomb (mù) on the southern shore of Lake Tian (DiƗn Chí).

8.2  Sports 
The Chinese government has long promoted sports and exercise as a means to health. 
Many urban dwellers participate in morning exercises timed to music over loudspeakers 
in public squares (yƯnyuè bànzòu de chénliàn ‘music-accompanied DE morning-
exercise’); and more recently, exercise courses have been constructed in public parks. A 
slogan from the late 90s was: 

FƗzhӽn tӿyù yùndòng, zƝngqiáng rénmín tӿzhì! 
Develop PE [and] sports, strengthen the people’s constitutions! 

While the traditional sports of pingpong, badminton and martial arts remain 
popular in China, a vast range of other sports, such as football (soccer), rock climbing, 
and motor racing, now attract participants or viewers. This section provides some 
conversational material and a list of sports and sport-like activities from which you can 
select.

8.3.1  Non-comparatives 
Questions about degrees of intensity can be asked using the question word duǀ:

8.3  Comparison 

 

XiàtiƗn duǀ rè? 
 TƗ duǀ gƗo?
 
 FƝijƯchӽng duǀ yuӽn? 

 

How hot are the summers?
How tall is he?
How far’s the airport? 

Responses often include adverbs or constructions that indicate degree. The list below is 
organized into types, and includes a number of new constructions. .

Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin

With the modification placed before the SV 

JƯntiƗn hČn rè. 
 
JƯntiƗn tӿng rè <de>! 
JƯntiƗn fƝicháng rè. 
JƯntiƗn bӿjiào rè. 
JƯntiƗn xiƗngdƗng rè. 
JƯntiƗn yԁu diӽnr rè. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Today’s quite hot.

Today’s quite hot. 

Today’s unusually hot.

It’s quite ~ rather hot today.

It’s relatively ~ rather ~ quite hot today. 

Today’s quite hot.


With the modification placed after the SV 

JƯntiƗn rè-jíle. 
JƯntiƗn rè-sӿle.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

It’s really hot today. (‘hot-the max’)

It’s boiling today. (‘hot-death’)


Mediated by the particle +de (଀) ‘to the extent that’ 


JƯntiƗn rè+de hČn. 
JƯntiƗn rè+de bùdeliӽo. 
JƯntiƗn rè+de yàomìng! 
JƯntiƗn rè+de yàosӿ.
 
 
 
JƯntiƗn rè+de shéi dǀu bù xiӽng chǌqù! 

It’s very hot today. (‘hot-to very’) 
It’s awfully hot today. (‘hot-to amazing’) 
It’s excruciatingly hot today!  (‘hot-to want-life’) 
It’s hot as hell today! (‘hot-to want death’) 
Today’s so hot no one wants to go out. 

HČn, you will recall, is often found with SVs that are otherwise unmodified: Lèi ma? / 
HČn lèi. In such cases, the force of hČn is weak, and it is often left untranslated. However, 
in the construction with +de illustrated by the first example above, hČn does convey a 
significant degree of intensity: Lèi+de hČn ‘tired to the point of very’, or ‘very tired’. As 
shown above, SV+de can also be followed by bùdeliӽo ‘extremely’, or even a full 
sentence, shéi dǀu bù xiӽng chǌqù ‘no one wants to go out’. 

8.3.2  Comparison 
a) Comparison is often implicit in the unmodified SV; but it is cancelled by the presence 
of preverbal hČn. Thus, for most, tƗ gƗo is ‘she’s taller’ but tƗ hČn gƗo is ‘she’s quite tall’. 

 

 

 

Shéi gƗo? / TƗ gƗo. 
TƗ gƗo yìdiӽnr. 
TƗ shƗowƝi gƗo yìdiӽnr. 
GƗo duǀshao?
 
 
 TƗ gƗo yí cùn. 
TƗ gƗo yìxiƝ. 
TƗ shƗowƝi gƗo yìxiƝ. 
TƗ gƗo yí bèi. 

Who’s taller? / She’s taller. 
She’s a bit taller. 
He’s a wee bit taller. 
How much taller?
He’s an inch taller. 
He’s ‘a measure’ taller. (eg ‘a few inches’) 
He’s a we bit taller. 
She’s twice as tall. 

Notes 

a) ShƗowƝi (or more formally, shƗo) is an ADV meaning ‘slightly; a bit’ (wƝiruӽn 
‘Microsoft’ de wƝi). Like other ADVs, it appears before a V or SV, but typically 
also in conjunction with a post-verbal yìdiӽnr. 

8 

Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin  

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

b) While yìxiƝ (cf. xiƝ in §6.3.3) and yìdiӽnr are similar in meaning, the former 
implies a particular amount, hence a ‘few [cms, inches, etc.]’. Duǀ yìxiƝ  would 
not be appropriate in comparing the populations of cities, for example. 
c) yí bèi ‘by one-fold; twice as’. 

b) Explicit comparison involves the word bӿ ‘compare; than’, which (unlike English 
counterparts) is placed before the associated verb. Expressions indicating the degree or 
amount of comparison (eg yìdiӽnr) are placed after the SV; cf. Néng piányi yìdiӽnr ma? 
‘Can [you] reduce it [by] a bit?’ from an earlier conversation.

BČijƯng bӿ TiƗnjƯn dà+de duǀ. 
BČijƯng bӿ TiƗnjƯng dà duǀle.

Notes 

BČijƯng is bigger than TiƗnjƯn. 
BČijƯng is a bit bigger than Tj. [by a bit] 
Beijing’s a little bit bigger than Tianjin. 

Beijing’s a lot bigger than Tj. [by quite a lot] 
BČijƯng is much bigger than Tj. [by a lot] 
Bj is a lot bigger than Tj.  [by a whole lot] 
BČijƯng is twice as big as Tj. [by one fold] 

a) As in English, where we generally mean ‘in terms of population’ when we say 
one city is bigger than another, dà in the above set of sentences is more likely to 
mean population (rénkԁu) than area (miànjƯ). 
b) Notice that the various ways of expressing degree with the non-comparatives 
do not overlap with those of the comparatives: +de hČn, +de bùdeliӽo etc. are 
unique to non-comparatives; +de duǀ, duǀle, etc. are unique to comparatives.

8.3.3  Another perspective: ‘not as…’ 
a) Méi<you>…<nàme> 
The claim that ‘Beijing is bigger than Tianjin’ is often negated not with ‘Beijing isn’t 
bigger’ but with ‘Beijing isn’t as big as’, ie rather than bù bӿ TiƗnjƯn dà (which is possible 
in certain contexts), the negative is usually méi<you> TiƗnjƯn <nàme> dà.  In actual 
conversation, the bӿ versus méiyou patterns may serve to shift perspective, just as a shift 
from comparative to non-comparative may serve to confirm.

Notes 

Yúnnán de lӽnhóu hČn kČ’ài, 
dànshì méiyou xióngmƗo kČ’ài. 

The sloths inYunnan are quite cute, but 
not as cute as the panda bears. 

Shì a, xióngmƗo zuì kČ’ài. 

True, pandas are the cutest! 

Yúnnán de Shí Lín hČn zhuàngguƗn,  The Stone Forest of Yunnan is spec-

scenery in Tibet. 

a) Countries are often characterized as fƗdá ‘developed’ and luòhòu ‘backwards’.

b) hӽibá ‘elevation; height (sea-exceed)’ 

c)  hǌxi ‘to breathe (breathe out-breathe in)’ 

d)  kùnnan ‘difficult; laborious (hard pressed-difficult)’

e)  lӽnhóu ‘sloths (lazy-monkey)’ 

f)  xióngmƗo ‘pandas (bear-cat)’ 

g)  zhuàngguƗn ‘spectacular (robust-sight)’ 


b) Bù rú‘not as’ 
A more formal expression, bùrú, literally ‘not like’ (sìjì rúchǌn de rú) can substitute for 
méiyԁu…<nàme>. With bùrú, where there is no following SV, ‘as good as’ is 
understood:

 
= 

Hànyԃ ne, Wáng XiӽobƯn bùrú Léi Hànbó. 
‘not as good as’ 
Hànyԃ ne, Wáng XiӽobƯn méiyԁu Léi Hànbó <nàme> hӽo. 

Otherwise, a SV may be explicitly mentioned: 

LӽoshƯ bùrú xuéshƝng cǀngmíng, 
kČshì xuéshƝng bù rú lӽoshƯ yònggǀng. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Teachers aren’t as intelligent as the 
students, but the students aren’t as 
hard working as the teachers! 

 

A Nanjing newspaper, Yángzi W΁nbào, had the following headline, directed to the 
youth of Nanjing: 

ShàngxiƗng bùrú shàngwӽng;  qiúshén bùrú qiúzhƯ.

put on-incense not-as  go on-web;  seek-divinity  not-as  seek-knowledge 

Better to surf the web than get stoned; better to seek knowledge than religion!

c) Comparatives with V+de: 
Comparing how well people do something may combine the comparative constructions 
with V+de. There are two options: either the comparison may be mentioned first, or the 
V+de is mentioned first: 

 

 
 

V+de, then b΃:
 TƗ YƯngyԃ shuǀ+de [bӿ wԁ hӽo]. 
 
 
 
 
 
TƗ chànggƝ chàng+de [bӿ wԁ hӽo]. 

 

He speaks English better than 
I
do.
 
She sings better than I do. 

B΃, then V+de: 
YƯngyԃ, tƗ bӿ wԁ [shuǀ+de hӽo]. 

He speaks English better than I do. 

ChànggƝ, tƗ bӿ wԁ [chàng+de hӽo]. 

She sings better than I do. 

Exercise 3.

4. Yòng kuàizi [hӽo] 
[bƯzhƝn ‘lifelike’] 
5. Huàhuàr 
6. Zhӽng

b) Do the following, either writing your answers down, or preparing for oral responses: 
1. Explain that Yáo Míng is 6 inches taller than Michael Jordan [Màikè QiáodƗn]. 
2. Note that you both like to sing, but that (s)he sings much better than you. 
3. Explain that you have an older brother who’s 5 years older than you. 
4. Explain that eating your own [zìjӿ zuò de] cooking is always better than eating out. 
5. Note that apartments (‘houses’) are twice as expensive in Beijing as in XƯníng. 
6. Explain that it’s frustrating (tӽoyàn): he’s doesn’t study as hard (yònggǀng) as you do,
    but he speaks more fluently. 
7. Explain that in the winter in Lasa, it’s so cold no one [shéi dǀu] dares [gӽn] to go out. 
8. Explain that the weather has gotten a wee bit warmer [nuӽnhuó] recently.
