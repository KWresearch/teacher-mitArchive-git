9.10  Stand a little closer 
Not all verb combinations are of the same type. One fairly productive pattern combines 
an action verb with a SV formed in the comparative with yìdiănr: 

Shuǀ kuài yìdiănr.

Zhàn jìn yìdiănr.

XiČ dà yìdiănr.

Zԁu màn yìdiănr.


Speak a bit faster. 
Stand a little closer. 
Write it a bit bigger. 
Walk a bit more slowly. 

Qӿng bӽ chuƗnghu d ăk  i.

ChuƗnghu kƗizhe ne. 
Nà, bӽ tƗ kƗi dà yìdiănr. 

Open the window, please.

The window’s open. 

Then, open it a bit wider.

9.10.1  Getting home 
A group of foreigners on a dusty trail near XuČsǀngcǌn, a village inhabited by Naxi 
people, about 25 kms north of Lijiang in northwest Yunnan. A pickup truck appears; they 
signal to it and inquire: 

Jiӽ:  Qù chéng lӿ yào jӿ kuài? 

How much to go into town? 

Y΃:

Notes 

a) The Naxi homeland is in Northwestern Yunnan, in and around Lijiang. The 
NàxƯzú (also know as the Moso), speak a Tibeto-Burman language, only very 
distantly related to Chinese, with its own pictographic script. In China, the Naxi 
are known for their traditional music. 
b) fǌzhù: fǌ  ‘to support with the hand’ plus the verb complement zhù ‘stay’; hold 
on. ZuòwČn ‘sit’ plus the rarer complement wČn ‘be stable’, ie ‘sit securely’. 
c) Ɨnquán ‘safety’; cf. Ɨnjìng ‘peaceful’. Ɩnquán dì-yƯ is a slogan that is often 
seen at construction sites in China. 
d) fàngxƯn ‘put-heart’, ie ‘be at ease’. 
e) sƯjƯ ‘driver ’; also a term of address for drivers, eg sƯjƯ xiƗnsheng ‘Mr. driver ’. 
f) suíbiàn: ‘as you like (follow-inclination)’. 
g) fƗngbiàn ‘convenient’. The construction here is parallel to: Xiӽng chƯ shénme 
jiu chƯ shénme ‘Eat whatever you want’. In each case, there are two question 
words, the second one referencing the first. 

  Lí LìjiƗng bù yuӽn de yí ge lùtiƗn (‘open air’) shìchӽng (‘market’).

9.11  Destination and goal: VERB + dào, zài or gČi 
There is a distinction to be made between combinations that consist, on the one hand, of a 
main verb and a complement verb (zuòwán, zhԃnbèihӽo) or compound complement 
(náchǌqu, zhànqӿlai) and, on the other hand, combinations that consist of a main verb and 
a complement phrase (bƗn dào xiƗngxià qu, wàng zài jiƗ lӿ). The former elaborates the 
verbal event in terms of its completion, success or direction, but in other respects, the 
product remains a verb and can end a sentence or be modified by le: Yӿjing kànwán le. It 
can also be made potential: zuòbuwán; nádechǌlai. Since the combination remains a 
unitary verb, it is written without a space. 

The addition of dào, zài or gČi (all often untoned) to a verb is quite a different 
matter. It requires a goal to be expressed: a location in the case of the first two (kƗi dào 
ménkԁur; fàng zài wàitou), a person in the case of the third (sòng gČi péngyou). The 
resulting combinations (kƗi dào, fàng zài, sòng gČi, etc.) do not act like unitary verbs. 
They cannot stand alone; they cannot be further modified by verb-le (though sentence-le 
may appear at the foot of the sentence); and they do not permit the insertion of de or bu to 
form the potential. For this reason, they are written with a space between. 

Another feature of the three verbs, dào, zài and gČi, is that they not only follow 
main verbs to introduce various ‘goals’, but each can also appear, as it turns out, before 
their associated verbs as coverbs. The options are as follows: 

Before the verb, as CVs: 

MíngtiƗn nƱ dăsuàn dào nӽlӿ qu? 

Where do you pla 
n on going tomorrow? 

Wǂ gƟi nƱ qù zhӽo tƗ. 

I’ll go find her for you. 

Wǂ fùqin zài Huádǀng YƯyuàn 
Ɨng yƯsheng.
d 
 
 
 

My father works at Huadong Hospital 
as a doctor. 

After the verb, as part of phrase complements:


TƗmen bƗn dào Pԃdǀng qu le. 

Theyಬve moved to Pudong.


32


Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin  

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

Bӽ xuƝzi fàng zài wàitou, hăo ma?  Put [your] boots outside, okay? 

NƱ de diànnăo mài gƟi shéi le? 

Who’d you sell your computer to? 

It is worthwhile reviewing the criteria which condition these options. Each verb is 
discussed separately below: 

a) Dào.
With destinations expressed, dào may precede the general verbs of motion, lái and qù:

dào BČijing lai; bú dào Shànghӽi qu. However, láidào, and occasionally qùdào, without

destinations, may also occur with the meanings ‘arrive; get to [here]’ and ‘arrive; get to

[there]’: 
TƗmen shi zuótiƗn wănshàng 
láidào BƟijƯng de. 

They arrived [here] in Beijing last 
night. 

YƟxǎ míngtiƗn xiàwǎ qùdào 
Shànghăi.
 
 

 

[They’]re probably arriving in Shanghai 
[there] tomorrow afternoon. 

lái or qù (bƗn move; zԁu walk; pӽo run; huí 
With verbs of motion other than 
return; ná carry; káng lug; jì ‘mail’, kƗi drive, etc.), dào follows the main verb and 
introduces the place towards which the motion is directed: 

1. 	 Wǂmen zuótiƗn hƟn wăn cái huí dào  Yesterday we didn’t get back to the dorm 
sùshè <lai>. Jìnbuqù, mén dǀu

The pattern also applies to more metaphorical destinations, of the sort found with verbs 
such as xué ‘study’, dČng ‘wait’, or kàn ‘read’:

Dì-bƗ kè gƗng xuéwán, xiànzài

As noted in Unit 8, dào can also function as the second element in a verb combo, 
rather like wán. In such cases, there is no destination, and like other verb combos, the 
verbs are written as a unit, without a space: 

Shuǀdào, zuòdào. 

Saying is doing.

 Mӽibudào. 

It canಬt be bought [here]. 

) Zài 
b 
With zài, there are actually three options. The location can be indicated by zài before the 

verb (functioning as a CV): 

Ɨmen zӽochén zài gǀngyuán
T 
dӽ yí ge zhǀngtou de tàijíquán. 
Z΁ochén, kǀngqì b΃ji΁ 
o h΁o!

They do an hourಬs taiji in the park in 
the morning. 
In the morning, the air ’s better!

dƗng fƗnyì. 

The 2008 Games are being held in Be 
ijing!

You can get a job there as a trans 
lator.

However, in cases where the location can be interpreted as a place where 
something or someone ends up, then the zai-phrase usually follows the verb: 

1. 

Zuò zài zhèr ba. 
Méi guƗnxi, zhàn-zhe hăo. 

Sit here. 
It’s okay, I’m fine standing.

 2.

bu hăo? 

Put your luggage in the luggage rack, okay?

Hăo, xi΁ 
oxƯn ba, bù néng yƗ.

Fine; be careful, it’s fragile. (‘not press’) 

Finally, with a number of verbs, the location can be placed before (in ‘coverb’ 
position) or after (as a locative complement), with only slight nuance of difference. The 

35


Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin  

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

best known examples are shƝng ‘be born’, zhӽng ‘be raised’ and zhù ‘live’: 

Wԁ shƝng zài Bèilԃtè, zhӽng zài KƗiluó, kČshi xiànzài zhù zài Luómӽ.

 Wԁ shi zài Bèilԃtè shƝng de, zài KƗiluó zhӽngdà de, xiànzài zài Luóm ӽ zhù. 

But the option is also available to other verbs. XiƟ ‘write’ illustrates the general 
distinction of destination ‘where it ends up’ versus location ‘where it takes place’: 

dest’n	 Bӽ míngzi xiƟ zài biăo shàng de 
dì-yƯ háng.

library; it’s airconditioned. 

c) GČi. 
i. As a full verb 
GČi is one of a relatively small number of transactional verbs in Chinese, such as jiƗo 
‘teach’, tuǀ ‘entrust’, and sòng ‘present’, that allow two objects to be expressed – the 
recipient  and the item ‘transacted’: 

V-person-thing 

gČi tƗmen ge jìniànpӿn 
jiƗo tƗ Zhǀngwén 
tuǀ nƱ yíjiàn shì 
sòng tƗ yí ge lӿwù

ii. Following a verb: V-gei 
Transactional verbs other than gČi itself require the mediation of gČi before the person. 
For example, while English says ‘sell him a car ’, Chinese has to say ‘sell-give him a car ’.  
Some of these verbs are listed here: 

mài gČi
sell to

 jiè gČi
 gČi 
 jì
   lend to  send to

huán gČi 
 return to

jiƗo gČi 
  hand over to

sòng <gČi>  ná gČi 
 deliver to
  take to 

dài gČi 
bring to

iii. Before the verb (as a coverb): gČi…V 
Used before the verb, as a ‘coverb’, g  i Č  introduces the person who benefits from the 
action: 

gČi nӿ jièshao jièshao tƗ 
gČi nӿ mӽi cài 
gČi nӿ dӽ ge diànhuà
