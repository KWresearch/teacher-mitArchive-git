6.1  Opposites 
With SVs, opposites can be formed by negation: duì > bú duì. However, in many cases, 
there exists a word that can stand in for the negative phrase as a true opposite: duì ‘right’ > 
cuò ‘wrong’. Occasionally, if they share a domain but are regarded as contrary, pairs of 
nouns can also be treated as opposites: xuésheng and lǎoshī; nánde and nǚde; gǒu ‘dog’ and 
māo ‘cat’. Exploration of opposites can reveal subtle cultural and linguistic differences. 
Chinese, for example, consider the opposite of xīn ‘new’ to be either lǎo ‘old’ [in the sense

of former or antiquated] or jiù ‘old’ [in the sense of used or dilapidated]. But lǎo, in the 
context of foods such as toufu, can also mean ‘tough’, opposite to nèn ‘soft’ [like baby’s 
skin]: 
 
 
 

The meat’s tough! 
This tofu’s quite soft. 

Ròu tài lǎo le.   
Zhè dòufu hěn nèn.  

 
 

Shēng (chūshēng de shēng, xuésheng de shēng) can mean ‘raw; unripe’ (as well as 
‘to bear; be born’) and as such, is opposed to shóu ‘ripe; cooked’. Shóu has a range of 
meanings, from ‘ripe’ to ‘familiar’ and ‘experienced’; it also has two pronunciations, shóu 
and shú, the latter more common with the meaning ‘familiar; experienced’ rather than 
‘ripe’. 
 
 
 

Rìběn rén hěn xǐhuan chī shēngyú.  The Japanese like to eat raw fish [‘sashimi’]. 

The English prefer well-cooked meat.  

Yīngguó rén bǐjiào xǐhuan chī  
shóuròu! 
 
 
 
In Chinese, the term for ‘opposite’ is xiāngfǎn ‘mutual opposition’. Thus: 

 
 

Rè de xiāngfăn shi shénme? 
<Rè de xiāngfăn> shi lěng. 

 
 

What’s the opposite of ‘hot’? 
Cold. 

 
 

Dà ne, dà de xiāngfăn shi shénme?  And ‘big’, what’s the opposite of ‘big’? 
Ng, dà de xiāngfăn yĕxŭ shi xiăo.  Uh, the opposite of ‘big’, I suppose, is ‘small’. 
Gāo ne? 
 
 
 
And ‘tall’? 
Well, the opposite of ‘gao’ is ‘short’; 
 
Nà, gāo de xiāngfăn shi ǎi;  
gāo de xiāngfăn ye shi dī.  
 
 the opposite of ‘gao’  is also ‘low’. 
 
 
 
 
Below is a list of opposites with rough English glosses. A feel for their range and 
usage will have to wait until they have been encountered in different settings; but for now,

you can practice pronunciation and start to get familiar with the words (SVs, as well as 
some nouns or noun-phrases) by asking for, or responding with, their opposites, as follows: 
 

Q: [   ] de xiāngfăn shi shénme? 

 

A: [   ] de xiāngfăn shi [   ].

6.2  Describing people 
Describing people involves a number of constructions. Most simply, a SV may suffice: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

She’s very clever.  
She’s quite cute.  
He’s a bit gruff.  
She’s kind of mischievous. 
They’re very well behaved [of children]. 
He’s kind of heavy. (‘fat’) 
He’s good looking. (‘smooth; in command’) 
She’s pretty.  
She’s kind of shy. 
<S>he’s cool. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Tā hĕn cōngmíng. 
 
Tā hĕn kě’ài. 
 
 
Tā yǒu diănr juè.  
 
Tā yǒu diǎn tiáopí. 
Tāmen dōu hĕn guāi.   
 
Tā bĭjiào pàng. 
Tā hĕn shuài.   
 
Tā hĕn piàoliang. 
 
Tā yǒu diǎnr hàixiū.    
 
 
Tā hĕn kù.

Notes 

 

juè 
 
a colloquial word meaning ‘blunt’ or ‘gruff’. 
tiáopí, guāi    words typically applied to children:‘naughty’ and ‘good’. 
shuài 
 
the sense seems to be ‘controlled; unruffled; cool’ and thence ‘good 
looking’; shuài is usually applied to men. Piàoliang ‘pretty; 
beautiful’, but whose literal meaning seems to be ‘rinsed with light’, 
is usually applied to women (also to clothes and beautiful things). 
 
In cases in which one aspect, or part of a person is being described, then the pattern 
is ‘topic-comment’, which often corresponds to a sentence with ‘have’ in English: eg: Tā 
yǎnjing hěn dà. ‘She has big eyes. (she eyes quite big)’

bízi

He has a big nose. (‘high’) 

In spite of the earlier example of ‘skin’, which can be characterized as bái or hēi, 
colors tend to be incorporated in a ‘categorial’ construction with shì … de (‘he hair be 
black-color ones’), as follows: 
Tā tóufa shi hēisè de.   
Tā tóufa shi huángsè de. 

 He has black hair. 
She has brown hair. (‘yellow’)

yǎnjing  

gèzi 
bízi 
liǎn 

Tā rén hěn hǎo.   Rén here has the sense of ‘as a person’, ie ‘he’s very nice’. Shēntǐ, on 
the other hand, is the physical body. 
‘eye’, with qīngshēng on the second syllable; contrast with yǎnjìng 
‘glasses’, literally ‘eye-mirrors’, with final falling tone. 
‘height; stature’; also gèr. 
large or prominent noses are described as gāo, as well as dà 
faces are often described as kuān ‘broad’ [typical of north China] or 
cháng ‘long’ or shòu ‘thin’ [more typical of south China]. 
‘skin’; people in China are often described in terms of skin tone. 
The Chinese usually describe the shades of brown to blonde hair 
that are characteristic of northern Europeans not as brown (zōngsè) 
 but as huángsè de ‘yellow’. If finer distinctions are made, then 
‘blond’ is jīnsè de (‘gold’) or jīnhuángsè de (‘golden yellow’), and 
zōngsè de can be used for darker browns.  
 
6.2.1  SVs as attributes 
There is a line in the popular song, Lóng de chuánrén, ‘Descendents of the Dragon’ that 
reads: 

pífu  
tóufa 

hēi yǎnjing hēi tóufa huáng pífu, yǒngyǒng yuǎnyuǎn shì lóng de chuánrén 
black eyes black hair yellow skin,       eternally 
  be dragon’s descendents 

 
The line shows that in addition to the ‘person (part-SV)’ pattern illustrated above (tā 
yǎnjing hěn dà), there is the option of placing color words and other SVs before the noun 
that they modify: dà bízi; gāo gèzi , etc. When characterizing a subject, such expressions 
are idiosyncratic. For example, although it is possible to say tā bízi hěn gāo, the alternative 
expression is usually tā <shi> gāo bíliáng<r> ‘he’s high nose-bridged’, ie ‘he’s got a large 
nose’ rather than just tā <shi> gāo bízi – though tā <shi> dà bízi ‘he[’s] big-nose[d]’ is also 
said. 
 

Tā <shi> gāo gèzi ~ gèr. 

Tā gèzi ~ gèr hĕn gāo.  

>

Tā bízi hĕn gāo. 
 
Tā tóufa shi hēisè de.   

Tā <shi> gāo bíliáng<r>  ~ dà bízi. 
Tā <shi> hēi tóufa. 

 
 
 
There is a nuance of difference between the two patterns. The first simply describes the 
person as tall, etc.; the second is more absolute, placing him in a category of tall people: Tā 
<shi> gāo gèzi ‘He’s of tall stature’. At this point, it is enough to be aware that both options 
exist.  
 
6.2.2  Zhǎng + DE 
Instead of just describing someone as gāo ‘tall’ or piàoliang ‘pretty’, Chinese often use the 
expression zhǎng+de ‘grow up [to be…] – with no final-le. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

He’s [grown up] very handsome. 
She’s [grown up] very tall. 
She’s [grown up] very thin.  
He’s [grown up] very strong.

_______________________________________________________________________ 
 

6.3  Verb + guò ‘have you ever…’  
When people hear you speaking Chinese, they are bound to ask you if you have ever been 
to China; if you have, they might also ask you if, when you were there, you had visited the 
Stone Forest (Shí Lín) in the southwest, or seen the terracotta figures (bīngmǎyǒng 
‘soldiers-horses-figures’) at Xi’an, if you had eaten special Chinese foods like sea 
cucumber (hǎishēn) or shark’s fin (yúchì), or done any of a host of other things. As you 
know from the brief remarks in §3.3.4, such questions, as well as their typical responses 
make use of a verb suffix, guò (untoned in northern speech), placed directly after the verb: 
qùguo; chīguo; kànguo. Guò’s root meaning is ‘pass; cross over’, but as a verb suffix, it 
signals that an event has [ever] occurred in the past, or has occurred over a period in the 
past, but says nothing about precisely when it occurred in that period. For this reason, guò 
is sometimes referred to as an ‘experiential’ suffix; its general meaning is ‘have ever had 
the experience of’; ‘did ever have the experience of’.  
 
6.3.1  Guo patterns 
Responses to questions with guo retain the guo in negative responses as well as positive. 
The negative response is, like that with le, formed with méiyou. 
 

Shàng ge xīngqī, nĭ shàngguo  
bān ma? 
Méi shàngguo, bù shūfu. 
 

  

Did you go to work [at all] last week? 

No, I didn’t, I was indisposed. 

 

7

Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin  

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

It should be noted that speakers from southern regions including Taiwan tend to 
align the positive and negative responses, responding to the first with yǒu (with or without 
V-guo) and the second with méiyou (with or without V-guo): 
Nĭ qùguo Táiwān ma?  
Have you [ever] been to China? 
[I] have. 
    +  Yǒu.  /  Qùguo. 
 
    –  Méiyou. / Méi qùguo >. 
[I] haven’t. 
 

 

 

 

The V-not-V question juxtaposes the positive with a final méi<you>, that can be 
regarded as a truncated version of the full negative, méi<you> qùguo Zhōngguó. 
 
 

Nĭ  qùguo Zhōngguó méiyou? 
Have you been to China [or not]? 
Hái méi qùguo, kĕshì hĕn xiǎng qù.  Not yet, but I’d like to.  
 
Shàng ge xīngqī, nĭ kànguo 
diànyǐngr méiyou? 
Méi kànguo; shàng ge xīngqī yǒu   No; last week, [I] had a lot of exams, 
hĕn duō kăoshì, bù néng qù kàn  
I couldn’t go to [any] films.  
diànyǐngr. 

Did you see any films last week? 

 

 
 
 

 
6.3.2  ‘Ever/never’ and ‘once; ever’ 
Two adverbs are particularly drawn to the construction with guò: 
 

cónglái 

céngjīng 

only in negative sentences; meaning ‘never’; sometimes reduced to 
just cóng; 
not with negative sentences; meaning ‘formerly; at some time; once; 
ever’; often reduced to céng in writing.  

 
Wŏ cónglái méi chīguo hăishēn. 
 
Nĭ shì bu shi céngjīng xuéguo  

I’ve never [ever] eaten ‘sea cucumber’. 

Have you previously studied Chinese? 

 

8

Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin  

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

/ No, I haven’t. 

Hànyŭ? / Bù, wǒ méi xuéguo.  
 
 
The indefinite use of shénme, meaning ‘any’, is also common with comments about 
experience: 
 
Shàng ge xīngqī nĭ kànguo 
 
shénme Zhōngguó diànyǐngr ma? 
Kànguo Wòhǔ Cánglóng. 
 

Did you go to any Chinese movies last week? 

 
 
 

[I] saw ‘Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon’.

‘have

6.3.3  Xiē  ‘several’ 
If you discover that someone has been to China, then you might want to know which places 
s/he’s been to. Něi ge dìfang would mean ‘which place’; but to ask ‘which places’, the M-
phrase needs to be replaced by xiē ‘several’, as in the following example: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Have you been to China? 
I have, I went last year. 
Oh, so which places did you go to? 
I went to Beijing, Xi’an, Shanghai; 
and also Canton and Chungking.

6.3.4  Times 
Frequently, you will want to respond to a guo-question with a number of ‘times’ or 
‘occasions’: yí cì ‘once’, liǎng cì ‘twice’, dì-yī cì ‘the 1st time’. Huí (possibly more 
stylistically informal than cì) is used in much the same way: liǎng huí, sān huí. Cì and huí 
are M-words, but because they measure verbal events (and are not associated with a 
following noun), they are called ‘verbal measures’. Another common verbal measure is 
biàn ‘once through’ (as when repeating something). Here are some examples:

Qǐng nĭ zài shuō yí biàn.   Would you mind repeating [that]. 

Have you been to Beijing before? 
This is my first time. (‘For me, this is  
1st time.’) 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

a) While kàn has a basic meaning of ‘look’ (cf. kànshū, kànbìng), jiàn 
(zàijiàn de jiàn) suggests an encounter. The two may be combined as kànjiàn 
‘see’: Kànjiàn le méiyou? ‘Did [you] see [it]? Otherwise jiàn suggests 
meeting, visiting, catching sight of. 
b)  Hăo jǐ cì, with hăo used here as an emphatic adverb.

c)  Zài (zàijiàn de zài – 再) ‘again’ is, of course, homophonous but otherwise 
distinct from zài zhèr de zài ( 在).

Other interesting foods include: yànwō ‘bird’s nest [soup] (swallow nest)’; jiǎyú ‘soft-
shelled turtle (shell-fish)’; yāzhēn ‘duck’s gizzard’ – more of a snack; hóunǎo ‘monkey 
brain’; and xióngzhǎng ‘bear paw’. The last two are often talked about but rarely ever 
eaten.

a) Wèidào N ‘taste; flavor’; 
b) Huá SV ‘slippery’; huáliūliū ‘slick; slippery’.  
c) Cháng ‘taste’; chángchang ‘have a taste’. The word is homophonous with, but 
otherwise unrelated to cháng ~ chángchang ‘often’. 
d) Ways of hailing waiters or waitresses vary with time and place (as well as the age 
and status of both parties). On the Mainland, people often call out with the very 
familiar xiǎohuǒzi ‘young fellow’ or xiǎojie to youngish waiters and waitresses, 
respectively. The safer path for a foreigner on the Mainland, is to use the term 
fúwùyuán ‘service person’, as in the dialogue. Older customers may simply call out 
láojià ‘excuse me; may I trouble you’. 
e) Lái, in the context of ordering food, means ‘cause to come’, ie ‘bring’.

An ancient city, west of Shanghai, close to Lake Tai (Tài Hú), known for its 
canals, stone bridges, and fine mansions. Until the growth of Shanghai in 
modern times, Suzhou was the most important cultural and administrative 
center of the region. Its earlier wealth is reflected in the great houses and 
gardens that belonged to merchants and officials. One of the best known has 
the quaint name of ‘The Humble Administrator’s Garden’ (Zhuō Zhèng 
Yuán). Much of the old city has been obliterated in recent years by industrial 
growth and extensive building. Hángzhōu is another historically important 
city, southwest of Shanghai.  
tīngshuō guo  ‘[I]’ve heard [it] said’; cf. tīngshuō ‘[I] hear [that]’. 
‘canal (transport-river)’; the Dà Yùnhé is the ancient Grand Canal, whose 
yùnhé 
southern terminus is at Hángzhōu. From Hangzhou, it runs north to the 
Yangtze a little to the east of Zhènjiāng, then continues northeast towards 
Běijīng.  
‘bridge’; yí zuò qiáo, yí ge qiáo. 
‘gardens (flower-garden)’; cf. gōngyuán ‘public gardens’. 
‘houses’; yì suǒ fángzi or yí dòng fángzi. 
‘(garden-groves)’, a more formal term for gardens. Tourist brochures for 
Suzhou use the phrase Sūzhōu Yuánlín ‘Suzhou gardens’.

6.4  When, before, after 
English and Chinese differ in the position of what are known as ‘subordinating 
conjunctions’, such as ‘when’, ‘before’ and ‘after’ in expressions like ‘when you’re in 
class’ or ‘after eating’ or ‘before going to bed’. In English such words appear at the head of 
their clauses; in Chinese they appear at the foot. 
 
 
 
 
 
The expressions involved have a number of forms: 
 

when [you]’re in class 
after [you]’ve eaten a meal 
before [you] go to bed 

shàngkè de shíhou 
chīfàn yǐhòu

De shí<hou> means literally, ‘the time of [having class]’, ‘the time of [having your bath]’ 
etc.

Qùguo, qùguo Kūnmíng,

the southwest. 
[I] did, I went to Kunming, Dali and Lijiang. 

You speak Chinese very well; did you 
Nĭ Zhōngwén shuō+de hĕn hăo;

Nĭ tài kèqi, wo cóng méi xuéguo. 
You’re too nice; no, I’ve never studied before. 
[NB céngjīng not with a negated verb.] 

 

 

 

 
 

Additional nuances may be created by the addition of zài ‘at’ or dāng ‘right at’ at 
the head of the when-clause in conjunction with de shí<hou> at the foot: 
 
<Dāng> tā huílái de shíhou, wǒmen   When he got back we were still in the bath. 
hái zài xǐzǎo. 
<Zài> chīfàn de shíhou bù yīnggāi   You shouldn’t drink cold drinks with [your] 
hē lěngyǐn. 
 
 
 
meals. 

 
6.4.2  Before and after 
Expressions equivalent to ‘before’ and ‘after’ are formed with the yǐ of kěyǐ, originally a 
verb meaning ‘take; use’; hence yǐqián ‘take as before’ and yǐhòu ‘take as after’. Now 
however, the meanings have congealed into unitary subordinating conjunctions, with the 
first syllable often omitted in written texts. A more formal version of both words make use 
of zhī (a particle common in Classical Chinese): zhīqián; zhīhòu.

Appendix II of this unit lists the more prominent dynasties of Chinese history. 
‘Dynasty’ is cháodài in Chinese, which, in combination with a dynastic name, is reduced to 
cháo: Tángcháo, Sòngcháo.  To help you learn the sequence, as well as to practice yǐqián 
and yǐhòu, you can ask questions and respond along the following lines: 
 

Tángcháo yĭqián shi něi ge cháodài?   

Which dynasty is before the Tang? 

 
 

Nà shi Qíncháo.  [Qínshǐhuáng  
de cháodài.] 
 
 
 
Nà, Tángcháo yĭhòu ne? Tángcháo yĭhòu  And after the Tang? What dynasty is  
shi shénme cháodài?   
 
 
after the Tang? 

That’s the Qin. [The dynasty of Qinshi- 
huang (the 1st emperor of Ch’in).] 

Tángcháo yĭhòu shi Sòngcháo. 

Sòngcháo yĭhòu ne? 

 

 

Sòngcháo yĭhòu shi Yuáncháo. 
[Ménggŭ rén de cháodài.] 
 

 

 

 
 

After the Tang is the Song.  

And after the Song? 

After the Song is the Yuan.  
[The Mongol dynasty.] 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6.5  When? 
The phrase corresponding to the English questions ‘when; what time’ is shénme shíhou. 
However, particular segments of time can be questioned with něi or jǐ, as you have seen in 
earlier units: něi nián ‘which year’; něi ge yuè ‘which month’; něi ge xīngqi ‘which week’; 
něi tiān ‘which day’; lǐbàijǐ ‘which day of the week’; jǐ yuè ‘what month’; jǐ hào ‘what 
day’. Like other time [when] and place [where] words, such questions generally appear 
after the subject and before the verb (or predicate):

May I ask when you’re going to 
Beijing? 
I’m going on Saturday. 

Qǐngwèn, nǐ shénme shíhou qù

the Olympics. 
 
In regions where Cantonese influence is strong (including Singapore and other parts 
of Southeast Asia), instead of the shénme shíhou of standard Mandarin, the expression jĭshí 
‘which time’, based on the Cantonese, is often heard:   
 
Tā jĭshí qù Jílóngpō?   
When’s he going to Kuala Lumpur? 
 
Tā bú qù Jílóngpō, tā qù Mǎliùjiǎ.  He’s not going to KL, he’s going to 
Malacca. 

 
 

 
Exercise 3.  
Write a paragraph along the following lines: 
 
When I was in China, I didn’t have much money; I ate noodles for breakfast, lunch and 
dinner. I didn’t eat seafood, and I’ve still never eaten sea cucumber or soft-shelled turtle – 
all too expensive! In China, everyday after I got up, I bathed, ate some noodles, and went to 
the university. I had classes from 9 to 12:30. I ate lunch at 1:00. While I ate, I often read the 
day’s paper. In the afternoon, I did my homework.  [Recall that le does not mark habitual 
or generic events.]

Expressions with shíhou (shénme shíhou, shàngkè de shíhou) involve specific periods of 
time. Shíjiān, on the other hand, is time in a more abstract sense. Here are some common 
examples: 
 
Shíjiān dào le.  
 
 
 
Zhījiāge shíjiān

6.6  Places of work 
On the Mainland, the subdivisions of government organizations (including universities) are 
called dānwèi, usually translated as ‘unit’ or ‘work unit’. In the socialist system, your 
dānwèi provided social amenities from housing to schooling, as well as access to social 
services and to routes of legitimate advancement.

6.7 Directions 
So long as one accepts the fact that asking directions will provide little more than that – a 
direction, then asking directions can be a good way to engage strangers and confirm that 
you are heading in the right direction. Here are some basic phrases: 
 

wàng qián zǒu  
towards front go 
keep going straight 
 
cóng zhèi biānr 
from this side   
this way 
 

wàng zuǒ zhuǎn ~ guǎi 
towards left turn 
 
 
 
turn left 

 
 
 

yìzhí zǒu 
straight go 
 
walk straight ahead   

zài ~ dào dì-sān ge lùkǒu<r>   
 
hónglǜdēng 
at ~ on reaching the 3rd intersection  red-green-light 
[in 3 blocks] 
 
 
 
traffic light 
 

 

 
 

chēzhàn <de> duìmiàn 
 
station DE opposite 
opposite the station 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

  

jiu zài yòubiānr 
then on the right-side 
it’s on the right 

 

 
Notes 

a) Wàng ‘towards’ is one of a number of directional coverbs that include cóng 
‘from’, dào ‘to’, zuò ‘by; on’, and xiàng. The last is similar in meaning to wàng, and 
in fact, xiàng could substitute for wàng in wàng qián zǒu. Xiàng also appears in the  
second half of the saying: Hǎohǎo xuéxí, tiāntiān xiàng shàng ‘advance daily’.  
b) For ‘turn’, guǎi may be more common in the north, zhuǎn, more common in the  
south. 
c) Duìmiàn is another in the class of words known as position words, eg qiántou, 
zuǒbiānr (cf §4.2.2). So like them, the reference place precedes: fángzi qiántou ‘in 
front of the house’; fángzi duìmiàn ‘opposite the house’.  
 
Chēzhàn shì bu shi wàng qián zŏu? 
 
Shì, yìzhí zŏu, hĕn jìn.  

Is the station this way? 
Yes, straight ahead, it’s quite close.

_________________________________________________________________________ 
 
6.8  The shì-de construction 
Reporting on an event (that has happened) is, under the appropriate conversational 
conditions, marked by le, either in sentence-final position or under certain conditions, 
directly after the verb. However, with the addition of a phrase designating location, time, or 
other circumstances, there are two options: the le option, and the shi-de option. In the latter 
case, a de (the possessive-de 的, as it turns out) is placed at the foot of the sentence, and, 
optionally, the time or location (the latter always in its pre-verbal position) is highlighted 
by a preceding shì:  
 

i. le 
 
ii. shì…de 

 
 

Wŏmen zài fēijī shàng chī le.  
Wŏmen <shi> zài fēijī shàng chī de. 

 

The two options are mutually exclusive: either you choose the le option, or the shi-
de, but not both. As noted in the previous section, biographical information can be provided 
in a matter-of-fact way without shi-de: wǒ chūshēng zai Běijīng, yě zhǎng zai Běijīng, etc. 
However, where the focus is more explicitly on the place, time or other circumstances, then 
the shi-de pattern is required. In a typical context, an event is established with le or guo, but 
the follow up questions utilize shi-de: 
 

A 
 
 
 
Q 
Qùguo.  
 
Nǐ qùguo Zhōngguó ma? 
focus on when 
Qùnián <qù de>. 
Něi nián qù de? 
 
focus on  with whom 
Yí ge rén qù de ma? 
Yí ge rén qù de. 
 
Shénme shíhou huílái de?  Wŭyuèfen huílái de.   focus on when 

1 
 
 
 

23

 
 
 

 

 

Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin

    focus on where  

 

 
 
 

Chī le.  
Zài cāntīng chī de. 
Mǎma hūhū. 

Chīfàn le méiyou? 
Zài jiā lĭ chī de ma? 
 
Hăochī ma? 

2 
 
 
 
Similarly, when asking when or where someone was born, or where s/he grew up, 
the focus is not usually on the birth or childhood – which can be taken for granted – but on 
the time or location. If you ask a couple when or where they met or got married, the focus 
is particularly on time and place: 
 
Wǒ <shi> 1946 nián shēng de. 
 
I was born in 1946. 
Wǒ <shi> zài Běijīng shēng de. 
 
I was born in Beijing.  
Wo yě <shi> zài nàr zhǎngdà de. 
 
And I grew up there, too. 
Wǒmen <shi> zài Duōlúnduō rènshi de.   We met in Toronto. 
Wǒ <shi> zài Bālí shàng zhōngxué de.  
I went to high school in Paris. 

 
 
 
 
Notes 

a) As you may have observed, zhǎng and zhǎngdà differ in distribution: zhǎngdà 
does not occur with following zài. So the two patterns are: zài Běijīng zhǎngdà de, 
but zhǎng zai Běijìng. 
 
The prototypical cases of the shi-de construction involve past events, and so it is 
useful to regard that as a rule. Talking about where you live, for example, does not allow 
the shi-de pattern: 
 
Wŏ zài Jīntái Lù zhù,   
lí Hóng Miào hĕn jìn.   

I live on Jintai Road, not far from   
Hóng Miào. 

 
 

 

or 
 
 
 

 

Wŏ zhù zài Jīntái Lù, lí Hóng Miào hĕn jìn. 

24

We met at university.  > 
 
 
                

It was at university - that we met. 
Wǒmen shì zài dàxué rènshi de.  

In some respects, the shi-de pattern is similar in function (and to a degree, in form) 
to the so-called ‘cleft construction’ of English, which also spotlights the circumstances 
(time, place, etc.) by using the verb ‘be’ and the notional equivalent of de, ‘that’. The 
English construction, however, is optional (or ‘marked’); the Chinese – at least in the 
situations illustrated – is required. 
 
 
 
 
Notice the stress pattern of the English, with high pitch on ‘uniVERsity’, and low pitch on 
‘that we met’, which is the part that can be taken for granted, or treated as the lead in for the 
item of interest, which is the place.  
 
6.8.1  The position of objects 
The position of de in the shi-de construction is complicated by the presence of an object. 
But not for all speakers. As a rule, the de of the shi-de construction is placed at the foot of 
the sentence; but speakers in the traditional Mandarin speaking regions of the north and 
northeast (as opposed to southern speakers) tend to treat objects (that are not pronouns) 
differently. They place de before the object, rather than after it: 
 
non-northern regions:  
northern regions: 
 
 
non-northern regions:  
 

Wǒ <shì> zài Bālí shàng dàxué de.   I went to university in Paris. 
Wǒ <shì> zài Bālí shàng de dàxué. 

Tāmen shì něi nián lái Běijīng de?  When did they come to Bj? 
Tāmen shì něi nián lái de Běijīng? 

northern regions: 
 
Only option with a pronoun:  Wŏ shàng dàxué de shíhou rènshi 
 
 
 
 
 
tā de. 
 
 
 

I met her when I was at uni- 
versity.

Shi zuótiān măi de piào. 
Shì zuótiān măi piào de. 

 

[That]’s the ticket we bought yesterday. 
[Both meanings possible.] 
[We] bought the ticket yesterday. 

In shi-de sentences, de before the object (shàng de dàxué) differs from de after the 
object (shàng dàxué de) only stylistically (or rhythmically); the two options are otherwise 
synonymous. The intrusive de is written with the same character (的) as the possessive, but 
does not function like the latter, though it is possible to construct a written sentence (in 
speech, intonation is likely to distinguish them) that is potentially ambiguous between the 
two:

option, as with location phrases (which can appear before or after verbs like 
shēng  and zhǎng), then it is the preverbal option that will be selected: 

Tā shi zài Běijīng shēng de, zài Běijīng zhǎngdà de, xiànzài yě zài Běijīng zhù. 

The only obvious exceptions to the preverbal rule are purpose clauses. Recall 
that purpose usually follows destination in Chinese: qù Běijīng mǎi dōngxi; dào 
chéng lǐ qǔ hùzhào qu. There is no convenient preverbal option. Yet purpose can 
be subject to the shi-de formula: 
 

Nǐ shi qù mǎi lǐwù de ma?  Did you go to buy presents? 
Shì, wǒ shi qu mǎi lǐwù de!  Yes, I went to get some presents.  
 
Such sentences can be recast with final qù (recall the various options with 
purpose clauses), in which case the sentence looks more like a typical shi-de 
sentence, with mǎi lǐwù the focus of shì, and de following a verb, qù: 
 

Nǐ shì mǎi lǐwù qu de ma?  Did you go to buy presents? 
Shì, wǒ shi mǎi lǐwù qu de!  Yes, I went to get some presents.  
                                                                                                                                   
     When objects – other than pronouns – are present, de can be placed before them: 
 

v. 

 

Wǒ <shì> zài Běijīng shàng dàxué de  ~ zài Běijīng shàng de dàxué.  

 
 
Exercise 8. 
Provide a Chinese translation for the following conversation: 
“Hello. I’m a student at […]. My parents were born in Canton City, but I was born in the 
US, in Chicago. I grew up in Chicago, but now, of course, I live in Boston. I have an older 
sister. She was also born in Canton.”

Notes 

a) Tángxiōng ‘elder male cousin (on father’s side)’; cf. tángdì, tángjiě and tángmèi. 
Táng is ‘a room’ (cf. yì táng kè), ‘the main house’, or by extension, ‘the clan’. The 
táng cousins all share a surname. The mother’s side cousins are all biǎo, which 
means ‘surface’ or ‘outside’: biǎoxiōng, biǎodì, biǎojiě, biǎomèi.  
b) Qǐng dào wó jiā lái wánr is a conventional phrase, equivalent to ‘you must come 
by and see us’; often preceded by yǒu kòng<r> [qǐng dào….] ‘[if] you have free 
time…’ 
 
6.9.1  Wánr 
Wánr is interesting not only for it pronunciation (one of the few common verbs with the r-
suffix), but also for its meaning. In dictionaries, it is glossed ‘play; have fun; play around 
with’ but in many cases an appropriate translation is difficult to find. In the Chinese world, 
wánr is the counterpart of gōngzuò ‘work’; in English we sometimes place ‘work and play’ 
in opposition as well. So a better translation would be ‘have a good time; for some fun’. 
Wán<r> can also be a verb meaning ‘fool around with [for fun]’; cf. máng ‘be busy’ and 
máng shénme ‘be busy at what’. 
 

That place is very interesting. 

If you have some time, come by again. 

What shall we do for fun? 
Why don’t we play mahjong?

1. There are a lot of large cities [dà chéngshì] in China. 
2. Why are there so many people outside? 
3. May I ask where you work?

6.10 Calling Michael Jordan 
6.10.1  Jiào with two objects 
The familiar verb jiào can take two objects, with the meaning ‘call someone something’: 
 
We call him ‘Chen laoshi’. 
Everyone calls him ‘the studious one’. 
What do you call her? 
Friends call me ‘young’ Míng. 

 
Wŏmen jiào tā Chén lăoshī. 
 
Dàjiā dōu jiào tā lăo fūzĭ. 
Nĭ jiào tā shénme? 
 
 
Péngyou dōu jiào wŏ Xiăomíng. 

 
 
 
 
 

A more colloquial form of this construction makes use of the verb guăn whose root 
meaning (as a verb) is ‘be in charge of’: 
 

 

31

Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin  

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

Wŏmen guăn tā jiào lăoshī. 
Tāmen guăn tā jiào fàntŏng. 

 
 

We call her ‘teacher’. 
They call him ‘rice bucket’. (ie ‘big eater’) 

 
 
 
6.10.2  Finding out how to address someone 
Frequently, in talking to someone with status, it may not be clear what form of address is 
appropriate. At such times a direct inquiry will help, using the verb chēnghu ‘call or 
address’, or as is appropriate in this context, ‘be called; be addressed’: 
 

Jiă: Qĭngwèn, nín zĕnme chēnghu? 

Excuse me, sir/madame, how should 
you be addressed? 
      It’s fine if you call me Yang laoshi. 
 
 
 

Yĭ:  Nĭmen jiào wŏ Yáng lăoshī 
       jiu hǎo le.  
 
 
 
 
 
6.10.3  Dialogue 
People in China will often ask about foreign entertainers and sports people. Here, 
a  Chinese youth (Ch.) asks an overseas student (For.) about an American sports star: 
 
Ch.    Xĭhuan Màikè Qiáodān ma?   
Do you like Michael Jordan? 
For.    Shéi / shuí? 
 
 
 
Who? 
Ch.   Màikè Qiáodān, dă lánqiú de.  
Michael Jordan, the one who 
 
 
 
 
 
 
plays basketball. 
For.  O, <Michael Jordan>. Tā de   
Oh, Michael Jordan. How do you say 
míngzi zĕnme shuō? Qĭng zài shuō    his name? Please repeat it. 
 
yí biàn. 
Ch.  Màikè Qiáodān. Wŏmen dōu jiào   Michael Jordan. We all call him  
the ‘Flying Man.’ 
 
 
tā ‘Fēirén.’ 
 
 
For.  Fēirén? Shénme yìsi?   
 
Feiren? What does [that] mean? 
How to say [it] - he’s like the birds, he can fly. 
 
Zĕnme shuō ne....tā xiàng 
Ch. 
 
niăo <yíyàng>, néng fēi. 
 
 
Right! 
 
 
 
For.  Ei, bú cuò.

Notes 

 

literally ‘hit basketball one,’ ie ‘the one who plays basketball’ 
‘flying-man’; MJ was also called lánqiú-dàdì ‘basketball- 
great-emperor’ in China. 
‘bird’; alternatively, tā xiàng fēijī ‘he’s like an airplane’. 

dă lánqiú de 
fēirén   
  
 
niăo  
 
This is a good time to mention some Chinese sports figures who are, or have been 
well known outside China: Yáo Míng (dǎ lánqiú de, 2003, Xiūsīdùn) and Wáng Zhìzhì (dǎ 
lánqiú de, 2003, Yìndì’ānnà); Zhuāng Zédòng (dǎ pīngpāngqiú de guànjūn ‘a champion 
pingpong player’, flourished in the late 1950s, early 1960s); Láng Píng aka Tiělángtou 
‘iron-hammer’ (nǚde, dǎ páiqiú de guànjūn ‘a volleyball champion’ from the 1980s); Chén 
Féidé, whose English name is Michael Chang (dǎ wǎngqiú de guànjūn, 1990s). 
 
6.10.4  Yíyàng ‘the same’ 
As observed in the previous dialogue, xiàng ‘resemble’ is optionally followed by the 
expression yíyàng ‘the same’, literally ‘one-kind’ (cf. jiu zhèi yàng<r> ba, zěnmeyàng and 
a host of other phrases that make use of the root yàng). Yíyàng can be used independently 
of xiàng, with items to be matched connected by conjunctions such as gēn or hé: 
 

Tā gēn wŏ yíyàng: wŏmen 
 
dōu shi yì niánjí de xuésheng.  
 
Tā hé wŏ yíyàng: dōu shì dúshēngzi. He’s just like me; we’re both only children. 

He’s like me: we’re both 1st year  
students. 

Nà nĭ shuō de hé tā shuō de bù 
yíyàng.  
 
 
 
 
Yí cì de cì hé yì huí de huí, yìsi  
chàbuduō yíyàng. 
 
 
 

Now, what you are saying isn’t the same 
as what he’s saying.  

The cì of yí cì and the huí of yì huí have  
roughly the same meaning.

Note 

Observe the order of elements in the last example: Topic [yí cì de cì hé yì huí de 
huí] followed by a comment [yìsi chàbuduō yíyàng]. Yìsi – sometimes called the 
inner subject – refines the scope of yíyàng.  

 
Exercise 10. 
1. He’s very strict, so we call him ‘the boss.’ 
2. She’s my mother’s sister, so we call her ‘auntie.’ 
3. Because Mr. Chen’s a director, people call his wife ‘Madame’ Chen. 
4. Because he’s rather old, we call him ‘lǎodàye.’ 
5. Although [suīrán] she’s not a teacher, we still call her Professor Liào. 
6. Excuse me, may I ask how we should address you? / It’s okay to call me Liáng Àimín or 
    ‘Professor’ Liáng.  
7. Their names are the same: they’re both called Lín Měi. 
8. They live in the same place. [ie ‘The places they live in….’]

6.11 Food (3) 
Chinese dishes are variously named. Some are descriptive: chǎojīdīng ‘stirfried-chicken-
cubes’; zhàcài-ròusī-tāng ‘pickled-cabbage meat-shreds soup’. Others incorporate proper 
names: Yángzhōu-chǎofàn ‘Yangzhou fried rice’ (from Yángzhōu, a city on the north shore 
of the Yangtze, east of Nanjing). Numbers are also common: shāo’èrdōng ‘cooked-2-
winters’, ie usually dōnggǔ ‘winter mushrooms’ and dōngsǔn ‘winter bamboo-shoots’. 
Finally, there are dishes with poetic or allusive names: gǒubulǐ bāozi ‘dog-not-obey 
steamed buns’, a Tianjin specialty. Listed below are some other examples which can be 
incorporated in prior dialogues dealing with food. 
 

máogū jīpiàn 

tángcùyú 

 

(‘hairy-mushroom chicken-slices’), often listed on menus by 
its Cantonese name, ‘moogoo gaipan’. 
‘sweet and sour fish (sugar-vinegar-fish)’

Notes 

Can drink 1 jin [but] drinks 8 ounces: 
apologies to the people, 
apologies to the party. 

Can drink 8 ozs. [but] drinks 1 jin: 
people and party, 
heart-linked-to heart. 

Jīn is a Chinese measure equal to 1/2 a kilogram; a jīn contains 16 liǎng or ‘ounces’. 
Rénmín  are  ‘the  people’  and  dǎng  is  ‘the  [communist]  party’.  Xīn  is  ‘heart; 
feelings’.
