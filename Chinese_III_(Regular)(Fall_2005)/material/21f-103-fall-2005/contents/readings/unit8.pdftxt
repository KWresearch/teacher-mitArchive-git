Notes 

a) Xichang is a city in the ‘Great Snowy Mountains’ in the southern part of 
Sichuan. It is now best known for the satellite launch and tracking facilities which 
are some 50 kms from the town; but historically, it is also an important center of 
the Yi people (also called Nasu and Norsu).

[Over] winter break, first I went 
home to visit my family. After a 
week there, I went to Taipeh for a 
meeting. I only stayed 3 days in 
Taipeh [so] I didn’t have time to 
see a lot of places. Next year, I want 
to go back once again to get to know 
more about Taiwanese culture, see 
more of TáiwƗn’s scenery, and to eat 
more Taiwanese snacks. That’s the 
reason that right now I’m thinking of 
how I can raise the level of my
Chinese some more, and earn more 
money. That way after I get to 
Taipeh, I’ll be able to speak
Mandarin to the people in Taiwan.

Exercise 1 
a) Prepare narratives along the following lines: 

1. Itinerary: Arrived in Shanghai at 5:30 pm; got the #4 bus to the Shanghai train station. 
Planned to take the subway to the hotel on ZhàojiƗbƗng Road; tired, lots of luggage; so, 
took a cab. Later on, moved once again to a hotel in Zhá BČi near the train station; that 
way, it’s easier to get to the airport. 

2. Daily schedule: Generally get up at 7:30, shower and have some rice gruel; bike to 
Beijing Yԃyán Dàxué for 10 o’clock class; at noon, eat lunch in the cafeteria with 
classmates; 1:00 to 3:00, two more classes; after class, off to the library to study. Usually 
eat dinner at a local restaurant. Sometimes, in the evening we go into town or hang out at 
bars and coffee shops; don’t get home until quite late. 

3. Over the New Year, I spent a few days with friends in Guilin, then went on to 
Kunming by train. Originally I had planned to visit Dàlӿ and LìjiƗng in the northwest of 
Yúnnán as well, but I didn’t feel well, so I just stayed in Kǌnmíng at the Camellia Hotel 
(sic) (CháhuƗ BƯnguӽn), wrote letters and rested. Later on, visited the Stone Forest (Shí 
Lín) and Zhèng Hé ’s tomb (mù) on the southern shore of Lake Tian (DiƗn Chí).

8.2  Sports 
The Chinese government has long promoted sports and exercise as a means to health. 
Many urban dwellers participate in morning exercises timed to music over loudspeakers 
in public squares (yƯnyuè bànzòu de chénliàn ‘music-accompanied DE morning-
exercise’); and more recently, exercise courses have been constructed in public parks. A 
slogan from the late 90s was: 

FƗzhӽn tӿyù yùndòng, zƝngqiáng rénmín tӿzhì! 
Develop PE [and] sports, strengthen the people’s constitutions! 

While the traditional sports of pingpong, badminton and martial arts remain 
popular in China, a vast range of other sports, such as football (soccer), rock climbing, 
and motor racing, now attract participants or viewers. This section provides some 
conversational material and a list of sports and sport-like activities from which you can 
select.

8.3.1  Non-comparatives 
Questions about degrees of intensity can be asked using the question word duǀ:

8.3  Comparison 

 

XiàtiƗn duǀ rè? 
 TƗ duǀ gƗo?
 
 FƝijƯchӽng duǀ yuӽn? 

 

How hot are the summers?
How tall is he?
How far’s the airport? 

Responses often include adverbs or constructions that indicate degree. The list below is 
organized into types, and includes a number of new constructions. .

With the modification placed before the SV 

JƯntiƗn hČn rè.

JƯntiƗn fƝicháng rè. 
JƯntiƗn bӿjiào rè. 
JƯntiƗn xiƗngdƗng rè.

Today’s quite hot.�
Today’s quite hot. �
Today’s unusually hot.�
It’s quite ~ rather hot today.�
It’s relatively ~ rather ~ quite hot today. �
Today’s quite hot.�

With the modification placed after the SV 

JƯntiƗn rè-jíle.
JƯntiƗn rè-sӿle.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

It’s really hot today. (‘hot-the max’)�
It’s boiling today. (‘hot-death’)�

Mediated by the particle +de (଀) ‘to the extent that’ �

JƯntiƗn rè+de hČn. 
JƯntiƗn rè+de bùdeliӽo. 
JƯntiƗn rè+de yàomìng! 
JƯntiƗn rè+de yàosӿ.
 
 
 
JƯntiƗn rè+de shéi dǀu bù xiӽng chǌqù! 

It’s very hot today. (‘hot-to very’) 
It’s awfully hot today. (‘hot-to amazing’) 
It’s excruciatingly hot today!  (‘hot-to want-life’) 
It’s hot as hell today! (‘hot-to want death’) 
Today’s so hot no one wants to go out. 

HČn, you will recall, is often found with SVs that are otherwise unmodified: Lèi ma? / 
HČn lèi. In such cases, the force of hČn is weak, and it is often left untranslated. However, 
in the construction with +de illustrated by the first example above, hČn does convey a 
significant degree of intensity: Lèi+de hČn ‘tired to the point of very’, or ‘very tired’. As 
shown above, SV+de can also be followed by bùdeliӽo ‘extremely’, or even a full 
sentence, shéi dǀu bù xiӽng chǌqù ‘no one wants to go out’. 

8.3.2  Comparison 
a) Comparison is often implicit in the unmodified SV; but it is cancelled by the presence 
of preverbal hČn. Thus, for most, tƗ gƗo is ‘she’s taller’ but tƗ hČn gƗo is ‘she’s quite tall’. 

 

 

 

Shéi gƗo? / TƗ gƗo.
TƗ gƗo yìdiӽnr. 
TƗ shƗowƝi gƗo yìdiӽnr. 
GƗo duǀshao?
 
 
 TƗ gƗo yí cùn. 
TƗ gƗo yìxiƝ. 
TƗ shƗowƝi gƗo yìxiƝ. 
TƗ gƗo yí bèi. 

Who’s taller? / She’s taller. 
She’s a bit taller. 
He’s a wee bit taller. 
How much taller?
He’s an inch taller.
He’s ‘a measure’ taller. (eg ‘a few inches’) 
He’s a we bit taller.
She’s twice as tall. 

Notes 

a) ShƗowƝi (or more formally, shƗo) is an ADV meaning ‘slightly; a bit’ (wƝiruӽn 
‘Microsoft’ de wƝi). Like other ADVs, it appears before a V or SV, but typically 
also in conjunction with a post-verbal yìdiӽnr. 

8 

Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin  

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

b) While yìxiƝ (cf. xiƝ in §6.3.3) and yìdiӽnr are similar in meaning, the former 
implies a particular amount, hence a ‘few [cms, inches, etc.]’. Duǀ yìxiƝ  would 
not be appropriate in comparing the populations of cities, for example. 
c) yí bèi ‘by one-fold; twice as’. 

b) Explicit comparison involves the word bӿ ‘compare; than’, which (unlike English 
counterparts) is placed before the associated verb. Expressions indicating the degree or 
amount of comparison (eg yìdiӽnr) are placed after the SV; cf. Néng piányi yìdiӽnr ma? 
‘Can [you] reduce it [by] a bit?’ from an earlier conversation.

Notes 

BČijƯng is bigger than TiƗnjƯn.
BČijƯng is a bit bigger than Tj. [by a bit] 
Beijing’s a little bit bigger than Tianjin.

Beijing’s a lot bigger than Tj. [by quite a lot]
BČijƯng is much bigger than Tj. [by a lot] 
Bj is a lot bigger than Tj.  [by a whole lot] 
BČijƯng is twice as big as Tj. [by one fold] 

a) As in English, where we generally mean ‘in terms of population’ when we say 
one city is bigger than another, dà in the above set of sentences is more likely to 
mean population (rénkԁu) than area (miànjƯ). 
b) Notice that the various ways of expressing degree with the non-comparatives 
do not overlap with those of the comparatives: +de hČn, +de bùdeliӽo etc. are 
unique to non-comparatives; +de duǀ, duǀle, etc. are unique to comparatives.

8.3.3  Another perspective: ‘not as…’ 
a) Méi<you>…<nàme> 
The claim that ‘Beijing is bigger than Tianjin’ is often negated not with ‘Beijing isn’t 
bigger’ but with ‘Beijing isn’t as big as’, ie rather than bù bӿ TiƗnjƯn dà (which is possible 
in certain contexts), the negative is usually méi<you> TiƗnjƯn <nàme> dà.  In actual 
conversation, the bӿ versus méiyou patterns may serve to shift perspective, just as a shift 
from comparative to non-comparative may serve to confirm.

Notes 

a) Countries are often characterized as fƗdá ‘developed’ and luòhòu ‘backwards’.�
b) hӽibá ‘elevation; height (sea-exceed)’ �
c)  hǌxi ‘to breathe (breathe out-breathe in)’ �

e)  lӽnhóu ‘sloths (lazy-monkey)’ �
f)  xióngmƗo ‘pandas (bear-cat)’�
g)  zhuàngguƗn ‘spectacular (robust-sight)’ �

b) Bù rú‘not as’ 
A more formal expression, bùrú, literally ‘not like’ (sìjì rúchǌn de rú) can substitute for 
méiyԁu…<nàme>. With bùrú, where there is no following SV, ‘as good as’ is 
understood:

 
= 

Hànyԃ ne, Wáng XiӽobƯn bùrú Léi Hànbó. 
‘not as good as’ 
Hànyԃ ne, Wáng XiӽobƯn méiyԁu Léi Hànbó <nàme> hӽo. 

Otherwise, a SV may be explicitly mentioned:

Comparing how well people do something may combine the comparative constructions 
with V+de. There are two options: either the comparison may be mentioned first, or the 
V+de is mentioned first:

b) Do the following, either writing your answers down, or preparing for oral responses: 
1. Explain that Yáo Míng is 6 inches taller than Michael Jordan [Màikè QiáodƗn]. 
2. Note that you both like to sing, but that (s)he sings much better than you. 
3. Explain that you have an older brother who’s 5 years older than you.

Chinese uses the expression zhƯyƯ, containing Classical Chinese zhƯ, which in this 
context functions like modern DE, to mean ‘one of’: 

zuì dà de chéngshì zhƯyƯ

China is one of the 5 permanent member 
states of the Security Council. 

Note 

The Chinese equivalents to what are called acronyms in alphabetic languages (eg 
NATO or WTO) are shortened or ‘telescoped’ phrases. Thus Àolínpӿkè 
Yùndònghuì gets shortened to Àoyùnhuì; Ɩnquán Lӿshì Huì, literally ‘security 
directorship organization’ gets shortened to Ɩnlӿhuì; and Shìjiè Màoyì Zԃzhӿ

8.4.2 Approximately 
Large figures are usually approximate. There are several expressions that may be used to 
indicate that a figure is rough. Chàbuduǀ and dàgài have been used in earlier units, both 
placed before the amount. DàyuƝ ‘about; around; approximately (big-about)’ also appears 
before the amount. Zuԁyòu, on the otherhand, which combines roots for left and right to 
mean ‘more or less’, is placed after the amount. 

Shí Lín zài Kǌnmíng de dǀngbiƗnr,

Notes
 

a) Yímín ‘to emigrate (move-people)’; yímíndào ‘to move to [place]’. 

8.4.3  Large numbers 
Apart from the numerals 0 to 9, Chinese also has simple words for five powers of 10: shí 
‘10’, bӽi ‘100’, qiƗn ‘1000’, wàn ’10,000’ and yì ‘100,000,000’. (100 million can also be 
expressed as wànwàn for figures from 100 – 900 million.) Notably missing is ‘million’, 
and it is useful to remember bӽiwàn ‘100 x 10,000’ as ‘million’. Nowadays, large 
numbers are often written out in Arabic numerals, rather than Chinese characters, though 
they are, of course, read out in Chinese. 

One important rule to note is that in stating large numbers, the highest possible 
power of ten is always used: in other words, 1,500 is always expressed in Chinese as 
yìqiƗn wԃbӽi rather than as *shíwԃbӽi. The key to forming large numbers, then, is to keep 
the five basic powers of 10 in mind, and work down from the largest relevant power to 
the smallest. Empty tens and hundreds columns (one or more than one) that are not final 
in the figure are signaled by líng ‘zero’.

8.5 Bargaining 
Purchases in China, as in most countries, can be subject to bargaining. This means a 
certain amount of time and engagement, but it also offers a chance for language practice. 
The rules for bargaining are difficult to make explicit, and in any case, outsiders (to say 
nothing of foreigners) cannot really know local prices, so the best to hope for is to get 
within a few percentage points of a good price. Chinese friends will generally say you 
overpaid (tài guì le), but you can respond that you got a free language lesson in return 
(yԁu jƯhuì liànxi Zhǀngwén ‘have opportunity to practice Chinese’)! 

Bargaining for expensive items, jewelry for example, or crafts, is a rather 
different skill from making minor purchases of commodity items. If there is a ‘give’ of a 
few percentage points built into the asking price of fruit or vegetables at your local 
market, or perhaps 10 to 20% in the price of material at your local bazaar, the difference 
between asking price and best price for an expensive item sold in a market, or even in a 
shop, may be 100%, or even 200%, particularly at notorious bargain markets frequented 
by tourists, like the Yӽxiǌ FúzhuƗng Shìchӽng ‘Yaxiu Clothing Market’ in east Beijing, 
or the XiƗngyáng Shìchӽng in Shanghai. Merchants know that if you make an absurdly 
low counter offer of, say 30%, that constitutes a promise, and you are stuck with the 
goods even if you eventually figure out that they are only worth 10% or the original 
asking price. So always respond to the question, ‘What are you willing to pay?’ with the 
counter-question, ‘What is your best price?’. Many people would say that for more 
expensive purchases, best to get help from a local friend. 

For low intensity bargaining, here are some useful phrases to begin with: 

Seeking a reduction
 KƟyƱ shӽo yìdiănr ma? 
Piányi yìdiănr, kƟyƱ ma? 
Néng piányi yìdiӽnr ma?�

 

Finding the bottom 
NƱ zuì shӽo duǀshao qián? 
Zuì dƯ de jiàgé shi duǀshao? 

Can you reduce it a bit? �
Can you make it a little cheaper? �

How much is your lowest (‘best’) price? 
What’s your lowest (‘best’) price?

Notes 

a) jiàgé ‘price’; also jiàwèi in southern regions. �
b) dӽ zhékòu, or colloquially, simply dӽ zhé ‘do a discount’. Zhé has a range of �
meanings, from ‘snap’ to ‘fold’, but in combination with dӽ, it means a ‘discount’. �
However, while English typically focuses on the amount of the reduction (‘10% �
off’), Chinese states the resulting discounted price (‘90%’), and it indicates this �
with a numerical modifier before zhé: jiԃ zhé ‘90%’; bƗshíwԃ zhé, ‘85%’. �
c) dČng yixià (ጙሆ) ‘wait for a bit (one time)’; cf. xiǌxi yixià ‘take a break’; kàn�
yixià  ‘take a look at’. �
d)  zhuàn ‘earn’ �
e)  jìnkԁu ‘import (enter-mouth+of+river)’; cf. §8.5 below. �
f)  With transactional verbs that involve movement away from the possessor, such �
as mài ‘sell’, dì ‘to pass; to forward’, the recipient – the person who ends up with �
the object in question – can be introduced with gČi (often untoned) placed directly �
after the verb: mài gei tƗ ‘sell to him’; dì gei tƗ ‘pass [it] to her’. This makes yet �
another pattern associated with gČi.�

Notes 

a) Chinese call ‘pepper’ hújiƗo ‘foreign pepper’. HújiƗo is not used as much in 
Chinese cooking as huƗjiƗo ‘flower pepper’, also called fagara, brown pepper, or 
Sichuan pepper. Unlike the sharp heat of làjiƗo ‘chilies’ which is associated with 
Hunnan cuisine, huƗjiƗo has a slightly numbing effect and, mixed with làjiƗo, is 
characteristic of Sichuan food; cf. Sichuan dishes beginning with mala: eg málà 
Črduo ‘spicy pig-ears’ and málà-jƯsƯ‘spicy shredded chicken’. 
b) Dàn, méiyou wèidao. 
c) Sè is a taste characteristic of shìzi ‘persimmons’ or unripe pears and  peaches 
(shƝng de lí, táozi).

say southern food (like Indian and Thai) 
is too heavy. Western food, too dull, 
Southern, too heavy, but Chinese is just 
right!
 

8.5.3  Adding or subtracting amounts 
If it’s not salty enough, you put in more salt; if you’ve given too much money, you want 
to take some back. The pattern is as follows – note the contrast with English: 

ADV 

V 

amount

 
duǀ / shӽo

fàng 

amount 

 gČi 

amount 

Though the pattern also occurs with zӽo ‘early’ and wӽn ‘late’, it is most common with 
duǀ and shӽo, normally SVs, but here filling the adverbial position. Here are some 
relevant verbs: 

gČi 
give 

fàng  ná
 
hold; take 
put 

lái 
bring (‘cause to come’) 

niàn 
read 

Duǀ chƯ yìdiӽnr cài!

When only one item is involved, the effect of the duǀ pattern can be achieved 
with zài (zàijiàn de zài [Г]):

Please bring another bottle of cola.

And in fact, zài and duǀ can co-occur:

Qӿng zài duǀ chƯ yìdiӽnr cài! 

 

 

 

 

 

Literally ‘Please have some more food 
again’, but used to mean, ‘Do have some
more food!’ 

8.5.4  Cuisines 
Chinese generally distinguish 8 regional cuisines which, for the most part, are named 
after the provinces with which each is primarily associated. These cuisines are often 
signaled on restaurant fronts by using standard regional abbreviations, or ‘alternate 
names’ (biéchƝng) of the relevant provinces: Yuè for Canton, Mӿn for Fújiàn, etc. 
(Abbreviated names of provinces are also used on automobile licence plates and for 
names of regional languages, cf. §8.6 below.)

Exercise 5. 
Provide Chinese for the following: 
1. Sichuan food is hot, but it isn’t as hot as Hunan food; Thai food is even hotter, I feel. 
2. If you prefer a ‘saltier’ taste, put in more soysauce. 

3. I’m not used to eating hot food, so please put fewer chillies in; please don’t cook it too 
spicy. 
4. Lychees are a bit too sweet for me; I prefer plums or peaches. 
5. Durian is cheaper in southern regions than in the north. Durian tastes a bit sour. 
6. Cantonese food tends to be a little sweet, with not much soysauce; Sichuan food is hot 
and ‘numbing’. 
7. �If durian is even a tiny bit overripe [shú], it stinks to high heaven. However, if it’s too 
unripe [shƝng], it doesn’t taste good either. 
_______________________________________________________________________ 

8.5.5  Banquets and toasts 
Banquets and formal meals, whether in restaurants or elsewhere, are almost always 
served in private rooms, with food brought in from the kitchen. The host generally sits 
fathest from the door to the room, or at home, farthest from the kitchen, with guests 
arranged to his/her left and right, roughly according to rank. Guests seated in a place of 
honor may ritually offer the place to someone of about the same rank before falling into 
line with the host. (A useful expression for resisting such social honors is bùgӽndƗng 
‘not-dare-assume-[it]’, ie ‘I don’t deserve it; you flatter me.’) 

Conversation at banquets is usually light and humorous, with anecdotes, personal 
stories, and often a lot of language play, so that foreigners even of quite advanced 
conversational ability may find it difficult to follow. One subject that can break the ice is 
the food itself – food names, ingredients, regional dishes and differences in Chinese and 
foreign eating habits and cuisines. 

At a banquet or formal meal, there may be several drinks served, including 
mineral water, soft drinks and one or more wines and liquors. While soft drinks may be 
drunk at one’s pleasure, wines and liquor are usually drunk only with toasts, which may 
be made to individuals, or to the whole table. The standard toast of ‘bottoms up’ only 
applied to drinks served in small glasses: 

23 

Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin  

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

 

<DàjiƗ> gƗnbƝi, gƗnbƝi! 
Hăo, gƗnbƝi.�  
 

 

Cheers everyone! (‘dry-cup’) 
Fine, cheers. 

Women will find it easier to resist calls to gƗnbƝi, since many women in China do 
not drink in public. But men of sober character will have develop ways of resisting calls 
to drink with minimum loss of face. The expression suíyì ‘as you please (follow-
intention)’ can help for a while: 

Jiă 
YƱ
Jiă 
YƱ

Lái, lái gƗnbƝi, gƗnbƝi! 
 Wǂ bù néng hƝ, suíyì, suíyì. 
Bù xíng, gƗnbƝi, gƗnbƝi. 
 Hăo, hăo, wǂ suíyì, 
nƱmen gƗnbƝi. 

Come on, bottoms up! 

I can’t drink [it all], [so] at one’s pleasure. 

That won’t do, bottoms up! 

[in jest] Okay, fine, I’ll sip, you swig. 

Other toasts may involve health, cooperation, success, etc. The CV wèi ‘for the sake 
of’, or the verb zhù ‘wish for’ may introduce such toasts. For the actual invitation to 
drink, jƯng nƱmen yì bƝi, literally, ‘respect you a cup’ may be used instead of gƗnbƝi. Here 
are some samples toasts: 

Wèi dàjiƗ de jiànkƗng gƗnbƝi! 
Here’s to everyone’s health! 
Wèi zánmen gòngtóng de shìyè gƗnbƝi!  Here’s to our common cause! 
Wèi nӿmen de xuéxí jìnbù gƗnbƝi!�
Here’s to progress in your studies! 
Wèi wԁmen de hézuò yúkuài gƗnbƝi!� Here’s to successful cooperation! 
Zhù nín jiànkƗng, jƯng nƱ yì bƝi!�
A glass to your health! 
Zhù nƱmen chénggǀng, jƯng nƱmen yì bƝi!  A glass to your success! 
JiƗqiáng jiƗoliú, zƝngjìn yԁuyì!�
Strengthen exchanges and promote
friendship! 

 

In giving toasts, it is important to raise the glass with two hands; extra deference can 
be shown by raising the glass high (still with two hands). At large gatherings, normally 
the host will toast first, at or near the beginning of the meal, and then later on, the head of 
the guest delegation will return the toast. Where a number of tables are involved, hosts 
and guests may walk over to toast other tables. People will often rise to toast. Possible 
expressions of thanks to the hosts are: 

Xièxie nӿmen de kuӽndài. 

Thank you for the hospitality. 

Xièxie nӿmen de rèqíng zhƗodài!  Thanks for your warm reception! 

At banquets or other meals, Chinese often play very rapid games of huáquán 
‘finger guessing’ or more generally, hƝjiԃ de yóuxì ‘drinking games’, with the loser<s> 
drinking. Such games come in a number of varieties, and need a lot of practice. With 

24�

foreigners, the simpler children’s game of ‘scissors, stone, paper’ often substitutes for the 
real thing. That game is called shítou, jiӽnzi, bù (‘stone, scissors, cloth’) in Chinese, and 
participants play by shouting out ‘shítou, jiӽnzi, bù’, displaying their choice on the count 
of ‘bù’. Another game, chóngzi, bàngzi, lӽohԃ, jƯ ‘insect, club, tiger, chicken’, is common 
and simple enough to learn. The rules are: 

Chóngzi chƯ bàngzi, bàngzi dӽ lӽohԃ, lӽohԃ chƯ jƯ, jƯ chƯ chóngzi. 

The cadence is fast, and participants simply utter their choice in unison, adding up wins 
and losses until some previously designated number is reached and losers drink.

8.7  Regional languages: dialogue and narrative 
The colloquial names for regional languages (fƗngyán, shortened from dìfang de yԃyán, 
and misleadingly called ‘dialects’ in English) are generally formed from the name of the 
province or city where the language is most current, eg Guӽngdǀnghuà  for ‘Cantonese’, 
or Shànghӽihuà for ‘Shanghainese’. However linguists, in order to suggest more 
accurately the region where the language is spoken, use more specialized names based on 
the names of historical kingdoms or regions, plus yԃ, eg Yuèyԃ ‘Cantonese’. 

Here are some of the better known Chinese regional languages; each subsumes 
regional variants – which are more properly called dialects. But even these may not be 
mutually intelligible. 

27�

Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin  

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

Guăngdǀnghuà or Cantonese 
The dialect grouping of which Cantonese is the standard is called Yuè, or Yuèyǎ. 
Yuè dialects include TáishƗn (also called Toisan, after the Cantonese 
pronunciation, and Hoisan after the pronunciation of Taishan itself), spoken on a 
coastal region of Canton Province, southwest of Hong Kong. Speakers of Yuè are 
found in many parts of the world. The majority of Chinese-Americans are 
descendents from emigrants from Taishan County and adjoining regions known 
(in Cantonese pronunciation) as Sze Yup ‘four counties’. Recent administrative 
changes have made the Sze Yup area actually Ng Yup ‘five counties’. 

Fújiànhuà or Hokkien 
Fujianese (or Fukienese) is also called Hokkien after the Fujianese pronunciation 
of ‘Fujian’. The dialect grouping as a whole is called MƱn, and within MƱn, the 
southern or western group that includes Taiwanese and the languages of Amoy 
(Xiàmén in Mandarin) and Swatou (ShƗntóu in Mandarin) are often called 
MƱnnányǎ ‘southern Min’. The descendents of Min speakers are now found 
throughout Southeast Asia (notably in Singapore, where they are the majority), as 
well as other parts of the world. 

Shànghăihuà 
The language of Shanghai is usually called Shanghainese in English (with an 
intrusive ‘n’). The dialect grouping that includes Shànghăihuà, Sǌzhǀuhuà, 
Níngbǀhuà and others is called Wú or Wúyǎ. 

KèjiƗhuà or Hakka 
Hakka is the Cantonese pronunciation of the word kèjiƗ ‘guests; strangers 
(guest-families)’, which reflects the fact that many KèjiƗ people settled in 
Cantonese speaking areas. Hakka speakers are found in Canton province, in 
bordering southwest Fujian, in Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as in many parts 
of  Southeast Asia.

‘house’ but in Mainland usage (with ge as M-word), ‘apartment’; a 
free standing house in an urban setting is a rare thing in China, and 
is usually called a biéshù, often translated ‘villa’, but more a 
‘mansion’ in fact.  Less commonly (but more commonly in 
Taiwan), apartments are also called gǀngyù. 
‘distribute give’, ie ‘distribute to’. Earlier in this unit, it was 
mentioned that mài ‘sell’ and dì ‘pass’ introduced the recipient 
with a following gČi; fƝn is another in this class of transactional 
verbs. 
M for buildings, mountains. 
‘six stories’. Older Chinese residential blocks are typically six 
stories high; above that, they are required to have elevators. 
a colloquial expression that, literally, means ‘raise-eyes’; ie ‘be 
attractive; striking’; often, as here, in the negative. 
A city in ZhèjiƗng province, near the coast, south across the Bay of 
Hángzhǀu from Shànghӽi. The speeches of regions in southern 
JiƗngsǌ and most of ZhèjiƗng are closely related to that of 
Shanghai, and are classified as Wú dialects. 
ADV ‘completely’; SV ‘be complete’. Wánquán yíyàng 
‘completely the same’. 
SV ‘not the same’; cf tóngxué ‘classmate’, tóngzhì ‘comrade’. 
used to close a list: ‘and so on; etc.’ Written with the same 
character as dČng ‘wait’, which is also frequently doubled: 
dČngdČng ‘wait a minute’. 
SV ‘be-complicated’; cf. bù jiӽndƗn ‘not simple’.

Chinese has two words that correspond, or at least overlap, with English ‘old’. One is lӽo, 
the other is jiù. In general terms, lӽo is the opposite of shào ‘young’, while jiù is the 
opposite of xƯn ‘new’; but it is also true that lӽo has basically positive connotations, while 
jiù has basically negative ones.  Below are some typical examples – or collocations:

Literally ‘1000 <pieces of> gold’, a tongue-in-cheek reference to 
daughters, eg liӽngqiƗn jƯn ‘2000 pieces of gold’ for ‘2 daughters’. 
Liӽng dùn ‘two tons’ is, of course, a humorous response. 2 tons is 
4000 lbs or 4000 gold pieces. In some southern regions, instead of 
qiƗnjƯn, daughters are described as jƯnhuƗ ‘golden flowers’: sì duԁ 
jƯnhuƗ ‘4 M gold-flowers’. 
zhàopiƗn<r> �N ‘photograph; picture (photograph-slice)’, or more colloquially, 
xiàngpiƗn<r> ‘photos’, both with level toned piƗn<r>. Without the 
r-suffix, both words are often pronounced with falling tone on 
piàn: zhàopiàn, xiàngpiàn. 
Children (sons or daughters) can be referred to as lӽodà, lӽo’èr,

hángsƗn, etc. (with háng ‘a row’).

8.10  V+le revisited 
As noted in earlier units, le (˞) may appear at the foot of sentences to signal a change in phase 
(xiànzài hӽo le; yӿjing chƯfàn le), or it may intervene between a verb and its object to signal 
priority or completion. (Of course, if no object is present, then the two le’s can only be 
distinguished by function – or meaning.) Historically, the two types – or two positions – of le are 
thought to have different sources. Post-verbal le is said to derive from destressing of the verb liӽo 
‘finish’, which is also written ˞ (cf. liӽobuqӿ), and in fact, in recitation styles, le is read liӽo, as 
in the following line from the song DǀngfƗng Hóng ‘The East is Red’: Zhǀngguó chǌliӽo yí ge 
Máo Zédǀng. Sentence le, on the other hand, is thought to derive from destressing of the verb lái 
‘come’, so chƯfàn le is, in an etymological sense, ‘to have come to the present state of having 
eaten’. 

8.10.1  Sequence of events 
One particularly clear manifestation of V+le is found in sequences, where the second event is 
conditional on the completion of the first: 

37 

Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin  

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

Shénme shíhou mӽi piào? 
Shàngle chƝ jiu măi piào. 

When do we buy our tickets? 
Buy your tickets after boarding. 

And, of course, where the conditions are more severe, cái may substitute for jiù: 

Néng chǌqu wánr ma? 
NƱ chƯle fàn cái néng chǌqu wánr. 

Can [I] go out to play? 
You can’t go out to play until you’ve eaten. 

Wǂ zăoshàng chƯle xiànrbƱng 
cái yǂu jƯngshen. 

Mornings, I can’t function until I’ve 
eaten a meat-pancake. (‘stuffed pancake’) 

In such cases, V-le O occupies the same position in the sentence as a time word: 

Wǂ sƗn diӽn huíjiƗ. 
Wǂ chƯle fàn jiù huíjiƗ. 
 Wǂ xiàle kè cái huíjiƗ. 

I’m going home at 3. �
I’m going home after I eat.�
I’m not going home until after class. �

A sentence le can be added to the clause as a whole to indicate that the event has 
happened: 

TƗ chƯle fàn jiu huí jiƗ le. 

She went home after [she] ate. 

Le after the first verb in these sentences serves much the same purpose as yƱhòu 
‘afterwards’, and in fact, where the second event is less likely to follow immediately on 
the first, yƱhòu may be preferred; or verb-le and yƱhòu may both occur. 

TƗ bì<le> yè yƱhòu dăsuàn qù 
He’s planning to go abroad to study in 
Zhǀngguó liúxué. 
China after he graduates. 
(Some speakers say bìyè le yƱhòu, treating bìyè as a compound verb.) 

8.10.2  V-le with quantified objects 
Another environment that is highly conducive to the post-verbal le was noted earlier: reference to 
particular prior events. One manifestation of this is the presence of a ‘quantified object’ (a 
numbered object). Contrast the following pairs: 

vs 

Or:

vs 

ZuótiƗn wԁ qù Cháng Chéng le. 

I visited the Great Wall yesterday. 

ZuótiƗn wԁ qù-le yí tàng

TƗ yƱjing shuì-le bƗ ge xiӽoshí 
<de> jiào le. 

She’s been sleeping for 8 hours already! 

A short dialogue 

Jiӽ.  Lèi ma?�
 Y΃.  HČn lèi, shuì+de bù h΁o. 
Jiӽ.  ZƗogƗo!�  
 
 
 Y΃.  Zh΃ shuì-le sƗn sì ge zhǀngtou! 
Jiӽ.  Nà, nƱ yƯnggƗi xiǌxi yíxià. 

Tired?

Sure am, [I] didn’t sleep well. 

Too bad!

[I] only slept 3 or 4 hours! 

You should take a break then. 

For a Chinese speaker, the relevant criterion is probably not the presence of a quantified 
object per se. But the notion of ‘quantified object’ is a useful marker for learners trying to figure 
out whether le should be placed after the object (at the foot of the sentence) or directly after the 
verb. Other examples: 

1. 

�TƗ huàn-le qián jiu qù-le yí tàng 
gòuwù-zhǀngxƯn. 

He changed some money and then took a 
trip to the mall. 

Notes 

a) huàn-le qián is the condition;�
b) qù-le yí tàng is a ‘prior event, with quantified object’. �

2. 

Mӽi shénme le? 
~ Mӽi-le yìxiƝ shénme? 

M΁i-le ge táidƝng, m΁i-le 
ge shǀuyƯnjƯ, yì bƟn zìdi΁n… 

What did you buy ~ have you bought? 
What sort of things did you buy ~ have you 
bought? 
[I] bought a lamp, a radio, a dictionary… 
[I] have bought a lamp…. 

8.10.3  Other cases of V-le 
There are also cases in which le intervenes between verb and object where neither the 
notion of sequence nor quantified object clearly applies. Such cases can only be 
accounted for by the more general sense of the function of V-le, as a way of checking off 
the fact that a particular event occurred. In the examples below, the particularity is 
sometimes indicated in the English by the material shown in brackets: ‘my meal’, ‘her 
meal’, rather than just ‘a meal’. Rather than try to apply a rule that is inevitably vague, 
the learner will do better to shíshì-qiúshì  ‘seek truth from facts ([from] real-things seek-
truth)’; study the examples, try to account for the presence of le and its position in the 
sentence, then test your concepts against material that you observe in your own 
interactions. Here are some examples in which the presence of le is probably not 
surprising, but the position directly after the verb, or not, may be harder to account for.

8.12  Verb Combos (2) 
8.12.1 Directional complements 
In Unit 7, it was shown that directional verbs (eg shàng, chǌ, guò) can combine with 
untoned lái or qù to form verb combos such as xiàlai, guòqu and huílai (or the 
corresponding potential forms such as xiàbulái ‘cannot come down [here]’). Now you 
will see that these pairs can themselves combine with compatible verbs such as ná ‘hold; 
take’, tái ‘lift; carry’; kƗi ‘drive’, fàng ‘put’, bƗn ‘move; remove; take away’. The 
complete paradigm can be illustrated with ná ‘carry; bring; take’: 

With ná 

náshànglai 
náxiàlai 
nájìnlai 
náchǌlai 
náhuílai 
náguòlai 

‘bring [them] up [here]’ 
náshàngqu 
‘bring [them] down [here]’  náxiàqu 
nájìnqu 
‘bring [them] in [here]’ 
náchǌqu 
‘bring [them] out [here]’ 
náhuíqu 
‘bring [them] back [here]’ 
‘bring [them] over [here]’ 
náguòqu 

‘take [them] up [there]’ 
‘take [them] down [there]’ 
‘take [them] in [there]’ 
‘take [them] out [there]’ 
‘take [them] back [there]’ 
‘take [them] over [there]’ 

Other examples 

bƗnjìnlai 
táichǌlai 

kƗihuílai
kƗiguòlai 

‘move in [here]’ 
‘carry [them] out [here]’ 

 ‘drive [them] back [here]’ 
‘drive [it] over [here]’ 

fàngjìnqu 
táichǌqu

bƗnhuíqu 
kƗiguòqu

‘put [them] in [there]’ 
 ‘carry [them] out [there]’ 

‘move back [there]’ 
 ‘drive [it] over [there]’ 

An additional directional complement can be added to this set: qӿlai ‘rise’. The 
qӿlai suffix has a number of extended meanings, but its with verbs of motion, it means 
‘rise’ or ‘up’: 

zhànqӿlai ‘stand up’ 

náqӿlai ‘hold up’ 

táiqӿlai ‘lift up’ 

Adding objects to directional combinations (eg ‘bring the luggage down’) often 
requires a grammatical feature that will not be introduced until Unit 9, so in this section, 
you can avoid mentioning objects at all (or simply place them at the head of the sentence, 
as in the examples). 

Usage 
a) 

 

 

�NƱ de dǀngxi nàme duǀ ya! Wǂ 
 bƗng nƱ náchǌlai, hăo bu hăo? 
Méi guƗnxi, wǂ zìjƱ ná ba! 
Bù, wǂ bƗng nƱ ná ba.�

You have so many things! I’ll help
you bring them out, okay?

Never mind, I’ll get them. 

No I’ll help you with them.

c)

Liù lóu.
 
 
 
 Hăo, wǂ bƗng nƱ náshàngqu ba. 
NƱ tài kèqi! Bù hăo yìsi. 

What floor do you live on?

The 6th.

Okay, let me help you take [them] up. 

You’re too kind! You shouldn’t. 

Wǂ de chƝ xiƗn kƗiguòlai, 
 hăo bu hăo?
 Hăo, nà wǂ zài zhèl΃ dƟng nƱ. 
 Jӿ fƝn zhǀng jiu kƟyƱ le. 

I’ll drive my car over first, okay?

Fine, so I’ll wait for you here.

I’ll just be a few minutes. 

Exercise 9. 
Without mentioning the destination, make requests as indicated. 

Examples 
Request that your friend help you to put the books down [there]. 
<Zhèi xiƝ shǌ> qӿng bƗng wԁ fàngxiàqu. 

Request that your friend help you to take the clothes out [of the drawers]. 
<Zhèi xiƝ yƯfu> qӿng bƗng wԁ náchǌlai. 

Request that your friend help you to 
1. put [the pile of clothes] back [in the drawers]. 
2. bring [the flowers] up [here]. 
3. carry [the luggage] down [there]. 
4. lift up [this suitcase]. 
5. take [these clothes] out [of the drawers]. 
6. take [the shoes] out [of the room].
7. lift [this computer] up [onto the rack]. 
8. bring [the things] back [here]. 
9. carry [musical instruments] over [there]. 
10. move [the things] out [there]. 
11. drive [the car] over [there]. 
12. lift up [the fridge]. 
13. put [the dictionaries] back [there].

8.12.2  Forgetting and remembering 
a) Forgetting 
The verb wàng ‘forget’ is familiar from Unit 3, where it was introduced in expressions 
such as, Nӿ de piào, bié wàng le! ‘Don’t forget your tickets’. 

44�

Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin  

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

Shԃjià, wǂ wàng le hƟn duǀ Hànyǎ.�I’ve forgotten a lot of Chinese over the

a phrase in Classical Chinese diction, ‘like this’. 

Wàng (like its English counterpart) can also be used in the sense of ‘leave behind 
accidentally’; in such cases, the place is introduced with a zai-phrase placed after wàng. 
(In general, where the zai-phrase indicates where something ends up, it follows the verb; 
cf. fàng zai ‘put [somewhere]’; guà zai ‘hang [somewhere]’. The three verbs, 
<chǌ>shƝng, zhӽng<dà> and zhù, which as you will recall, allow zai-phrases before and 
after, are harder to rationalize.) 

O, wԁ de píbƗo wàng zai 
jiƗ lӿ le. 

ƖiyƗ, hùzhào wàng zai 
jƯchӽng le! 

I’ve left my wallet at home. 

Aach, [I] left my passport at the airport. 

The presence of zài after the verb (where it is often untoned) precludes the possibility of 
V-le; *wàng zài le jiƗ lӿ does not occur. 

Wàngjì ‘forget-note+down’ is a common alternative to wàng…le and, especially 
in Taiwan, so is wàngdiào ‘forget-fall’. 

Wԁ wàng le ~ wԁ wàngjì le ~ wԁ wàngdiào le. 

b) Remembering: 
The counterpart of wàng is jì ‘to note’ – the same root that shows up in the compound 
wàngjì ‘forget’, mentioned above.

Ng, Hànzì, yòu nán jì, yòu róngyi  Chinese characters are tough to remember�

NƱ jìde bu jìde nèi ge rén? TƗ zài

Wǂ jìbuqƯngchu. 

Do you remember that guy? He worked �
in our unit for a year. �

I don’t recall [him] clearly. 

Notes 

a) yòu…yòu… ‘both…and…’; cf. yòu mƝn yòu rè. 
b) QƯngchu in he last sentence is acting as a verb complement to jì; the whole is in 
the potential form; cf TƗ méi shuǀqƯngchu. ‘She didn’t talk [about it] very 
clearly.’ 

Where recall takes place suddenly, the verb combo xiӽngqӿlai is used. It is a short 
metaphorical leap from literally rising, as in zhànqӿlai, to having memories surge up in 
the mind. 

O, xiӽngqӿlai le! 

Oh, now I remember! 

Wԁ xiӽngbùqӿ ta de míngzi <lai> le.  I can’t recall her name [anymore]. 

c) In song:�
Forgetting and remembering are common themes in popular songs. Here are lines from �
songs of one of the most popular of Chinese singers, Dèng Lìjǌn – Teresa Teng (1953 – �
1995):�

From Wàngjì tƗ ‘forgetting him’: 

Wàngjì tƗ dČngyú wàngdiào le yíqiè. 
Forget him equals forget-drop LE everything. 

From Chǌliàn de dìfang ‘the place where love began’: 

Wԁ jìde yԁu yíge dìfang, wԁ yóngyuӽn yóngyuӽn bù néng wàng; 
not can forget 
forever

From Xiӽngqӿ nӿ ‘remembering you’: 

 

 

Xiӽngqӿ nӿ, xiӽngqӿ nӿ nèi xiàoliӽn, cháng zài wԁ xƯn liúliàn. 
recall you, recall you that smiling-face, often in my heart remain-love 

8.12.3  I haven’t slept for two days! 
As you know, duration is expressed by a phrase placed after the verb (and before 
associated objects):

 

 

ZuótiƗn wӽnshàng wԁ zhӿ shuì le 
sƗn ge xiăoshí, jƯntiƗn hČn hútu. 

I only slept 3 hours last night; today 
I’m quite muddled. 

Duìbuqӿ, nӿ dČng le hČn jiԃ le! 
Bù, gƗng dào.  
 
 

Sorry, you’ve been waiting a long time!
No, just got here. 

Not doing something for a period of time, however, is treated differently. The 
time of deprivation is treated as though it were ‘time when’ and placed before the verb. 
Final le underscores the fact that the deprivation continues – ‘so far’: 

Wǂ sƗn ge yuè méi jƯhuì shuǀ 
Hànyǎ le.
 
 
 
 NƱ zuì hăo duǀ fùxí yixià. 

I haven’t had a chance to speak Chinese for

You’d better review some more then. 

Wǂ sƗn tiƗn méi shuìjiào le.

Máo Zédǀng, late in his era, used to talk about the sì yԁu, literally ‘the four haves’, but 
usually translated as ‘the four musts’: a bicycle, radio, watch and sewing machine. Later 
Dèng Xiӽopíng added the bƗ dà ‘the 8 bigs’ (the rest of the list below). Now, people talk, 
humorously, about the xƯn de sì yԁu ‘the new 4 musts’: chƝ, fáng, kuӽn and xíng, which 
make abbreviated reference to ‘a car’, ‘a house’, ‘money (funds)’ and ‘fashion [what’s 
in]’. The three sets listed below can be roughly associated with particular eras, eg qƯshí

8.16  Rhymes and rhythms 
a) Rhymes like the one in Unit 3 that begins èrlóu sƗnlóu, chӽngzhӽng shǌjì, or the one in 
Unit 5, beginning néng hƝ yì jƯn, hƝ bƗ liӽng, are called shùnkԁuliǌr in Chinese, meaning 
something like ‘tripping off the tongue’, a contagious style of doggerel as well as a way 
of venting frustration towards the powerful and privileged. One productive pattern of 
shùnkԁuliǌr takes as its start a rough estimate of the population of China, and estimates 
the percentage – usually 90% – who indulge in some dubious activity: shíyì rénmín jiԃyì 
(verb) ’[among] 1 billion people, 900 million [verb]’. Here are some examples from a 
recent article by Hua Lin in the Journal of the Chinese Language Teachers Association 
(vol. 36.1, 2001). The first one comments wrily on the Chinese predilection for gambling 
and the current interest in ballroom dancing; the second is directed to officials who live 
off government largesse. 

Shíyì rénmín jiԃyì dԃ 
hái yԁu yíyì zài tiàowԃ. 

1-billion people 900-million gamble
still have 100-million be-at dancing. 

Shíyì rénmín jiԃyì máng,

1-billion people 900-million busy

b) Now, a less cynical rhyme, about the moon: 

Yuè guƗngguƗng, zhào gԃchӽng,  moon bright, shine+on grain-fields 
gԃchӽng shàng, nóngrén máng. 
grain-fields on, farmers busy 
JƯnnián dàogԃ shǀuchéng hăo, 
this-year rice harvest good 
jiƗjiƗ hùhù lètáotáo. 
every household full+of+joy 

c) And finally, a never-ending story: 

Cóngqián yԁu yí zuò shƗn, 
shƗn lƱ yԁu ge miào, 
miào lƱ yԁu ge héshàng jiăng gùshi; 
jiăng de shénme gùshi?
