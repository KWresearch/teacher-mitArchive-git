9.4  Setting the stage: Verb-zhe (ᓹ ; often ᓎ in Taiwan) 
Of the three particles associated with the verb in Chinese, guo was encountered early on, 
le (in its post-verbal manifestation) more recently, but zhe has been almost completely 
avoided until now. There is a reason for this. Most of the language presented so far has 
dealt with events, actions or inner states. Zhe is rare in such language. Zhe serves 
primarily to set the scene (‘the door’s open, there’s a vase on the table, the blinds are 
drawn’) and to indicate the various configurations of the actors (‘a man’s standing at the 
door, he’s wearing a long robe and holding a pipe in his hands’). Like guo and le, zhe 
precludes any other attachments to the verb – other suffixes (such as guo or le) or verbal 
complements (such as wán or guòlai).

9.4.1 Verbs involving configuration or bodily attitudes 
hànZ
 and zuò and the words listed below are examples of verbs that involve attitudes or 
configurations of the body that are compatible with the persisting state interpretation and 
therefore particularly susceptible to the zhe suffix. 

zhàn  zuò 
sit 
stand 
 
 

tӽng 
lie 
 

shuì<jiào> 
sleep 
 

 

dČng  dƯng 
dǌn 
watch 
squat;  wait 
crouch  
intently

lèng 
stare
 
blankly

 

 

Examples
 TƗ zài dìbӽn shàng shuì-zhe ne. 
He’s asleep on the floor.

 TƗ zài shƗfa shàng tӽng-zhe ne. 
She was lying on the sofa.

 TƗmen zài ménkǂu dČng-zhe nƱ ne.  They’re waiting for you at the door.


Bié lèng-zhe. Lái bƗng wǂ ná! 
DuìbuqƱ, wǂ lèi+de bùdeliăo. 

Don’t just stare; give me a hand. 

Sorry, I’m exhausted.

Wǂ tóngyì.

 

 

 

With #2, sitting isn’t as comfortable
as squatting. 
I agree. 

Standing or sitting in class? 
The act of standing up can be expressed as zhànqƱlai; the act of sitting down, as zuòxià – 
both making use of directional complements (comparable to English ‘up’ and ‘down’). 
However, once the acts have been performed, the resulting states are ‘standing’ and 
‘sitting’, respectively: zhàn-zhe and zuò-zhe: 

Kuài  yào  shàngkè  de  shíhou  lăoshƯ  gƝn  nƱmen  shuǀ  shénme  ne?  TƗ  shuǀ 
“Shàngkè.”  NƱmen  jiu  zhànqƱlai  gƝn tƗ  shuǀ:  “LăoshƯ,  hăo.”  Ránhòu  ne?  NƱmen

Verbs of wearing (chuƗn, dài ‘wear [accessories]’, jì [ties]) and holding (ná 
‘carry; hold’, dài  ‘lead; bring’) also commonly appear with zhe:

9.4.2  Doors and windows 
In addition to the configurations of people, the arrangement of furnishings and other 
objects in a room can also be presented with V-zhe.

b) Existance: Location V 
i 
-zhe  tem 
V-zhe can also provide a more precise substitute for yԁu in the existence pattern: 

LOC’N  yԁu  ITEM 

> 

LOC’N   V-zhe  ITEM 

ChuƗnghu pángbiƗnr yԁu 
yì zhƗng zhuǀzi. 

There’s a table next to the window. 

> 

ChuƗnghu pángbiƗnr fàng-zhe 
yì zhƗng zhuǀzi. 

There’s a table standing next to the window. 
(ie ‘placed there and remaining’) 

English often uses the verbs ‘stand’ or ‘sit’ in such contexts, extending terms that are 
otherwise only applied to humans to physical objects. Chinese does not do this: 

Zhuǀzi shàng fàng-zhe yí ge 
huƗpíng. 

There was a vase sitting on the table.


Other examples: 

Zhuǀzi shàng bӽi-zhe jӿ zhƗng 
 
 
 
míngpiàn.

A number of business cards were arranged 

on the table.


Qiáng shàng guà-zhe yì fú huàr. 

Hanging on the wall was a painting.


ShƗfa shàng zuò-zhe yí ge jӿngchá. 

A policeman was sitting on the sofa.  


Zhuǀzi dӿxia shuì-zhe yí ge xiӽo 
wáwa. 

A baby was sleeping under the table.


c) Location: Person Location V-zhe <ne>. 
The location pattern with zài  also has its correlate with V-zhe: 

TƗ zài chuáng shàng zuò-zhe ne. 

They are/were sitting on the bed. 

TƗmen zài shƗfa shàng shuì-zhe ne.  They’re sleeping on the sofa. 

Kèren zài ménkǂu dČng-zhe nƱ ne. 

[Your] guest’s waiting for you at the door. 

d) V-zhe V  
Zhe frequently accompanies the first of two verbs. In such cases, V-zhe provides the 
setting, or context, for the second verb: 

TƗ ná-zhe huà huíjiƗ le. 

She went home, holding the painting.


 

Bù yƯnggƗi dƯ-zhe tóu zԁulù! 

You shouldn’t walk with your head down.

Notes 

 TƗ xiào-zhe shuǀ:	

She laughed and said: 

Wԁ méi shíjiƗn gƝn nӿ cƗi-zhe 
wánr. 
 
 
 
 

I don’t have time to play guessing games
with you. (‘guess-ing have fun’) 

a) dƯ ‘to lower’; contrast dӿxià ‘under; underneath’. 

b) xiào ‘laugh; smile’; cf. xiàohuà ‘a joke’; kƗi wánxiào ‘be kidding’. 

c) cƗi ‘guess’; cƗiduì ‘guess right’ and cƗicuò‘guess wrong’; cƗibuchǌ ‘cannot

e) V-zhe in imperatives 
Zhe can also appear in imperatives: 

 

Nӿ liú-zhe ba.

Ná-zhe ba.

 DČng-zhe ba.

TƯng-zhe – bié zài shuǀ le!


 

 

 

You take [it]. (‘keep-persist’) 

Hold [it], please. (‘hold persist’)

Hang on.

Listen – don’t say any more!


f) Negation 
There seems to be relatively little need to report the negation of a persistent state. But 
where it occurs, it is formed with méi<you>, (usually) without zhe: 

Mén shì bu shì kƗi-zhe ne? 
Méi kƗi, guƗn-zhe de.	

 

Is the door open? 
It isn’t open, it’s closed. 

QƱngwèn, jӿ diӽn?

9.4.3  Ongoing acts versus persisting states 
First impressions tend to associate V-zhe with English V-ing: zhànzhe ‘standing’; zuòzhe 
‘sitting’. However, while it is true that many cases of V-zhe do correspond to V-ing in 
English, the reverse is not true: many cases of V-ing do not correspond to V-zhe. The 
reason for this is that English uses V-ing for both ongoing acts, and for the ongoing states 
that result: 

She’s standing up right now. 

TƗ zhèng zài zhànqӿlai ne. [act] 

She’s not moving, she’s 
just standing there. 

TƗ bú dòng, jiu zài nàr zhàn-zhe ne. 
[state]

Zhèng zài  supports the directional complement, qӿlai, to underscore the fact that 
the action is happening before our eyes – it’s ongoing; while the presence of zhe after 
zhàn indicates that the standing is persistent. While both are in a sense ongoing, Chinese 
distinguishes them as ongoing act versus persisting state. 

Recall that ongoing or recent actions are often explicitly marked by zài placed in 
the adverbial position right before the verb: 

TƗmen hái zài xӿzӽo ne.  

Nӿ zuìjìn zài zuò shénme?

TƗmen tiƗntiƗn zài xuéxí

Zhǀngwén.


They’re still bathing.

What have you been doing lately?

They’ve been studying Chinese daily.


To emphasize how current the action is, the ADV zhèng ‘exact’ can be placed before zài: 

TƗ zhèng zài chƯfàn ne. YìhuƱr gƟi 
nƱ dӽguoqu, xíng ma? 
Xíng, bù jí, bù jí. 

She’s eating right now. Can she phone you 
[back] in a short while? 
Sure, no hurry. 

Wԁ zhèng zài xӿzӽo de shíhou, 
jӿngchá gČi wԁ dӽ le ge diànhuà. 
TƗmen gƝn n΃ shuǀ shénme? 

The police phoned me just as I was having a 
bath. 
What did they want? 

TƗ zhèng zài gƝn tƗ shuǀhuà ne. 
TƗmen zài shuǀ xiƝ shénme? 

She’s talking to him right now. 
What are they talking about? 

14 

Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin  

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

In fact, for some northern speakers, the pattern can be further reinforced by a following 
zhe – along with final ne: 

Zhèng zài xià-zhe yԃ ne. 
ZƗogƗo, w΅ de s΁n wàng zài 
jiƗ l΃ le. 

 

It’s raining right now! 
Drat, I’ve left my umbrella at home!

The fact that zài may co-occur with zhe may seem strange, since in the last section, V-zhe
was viewed in contrast to the zai-V pattern. But apparently, in some cases the two notions 
of ongoing and persisting can complement one another. The range of the V-ing form in 
English (the so-called progressive tense) – which includes ongoing actions (putting on) 
and persistent states (wearing) – is, after all, a precedent for associating the two notions. 

9.4.4  Perspectives 
Notice that some situations can be interpreted as ongoing actions or persistent states: 

TƗ zhèng zài shuìjiào ne.

9.4.5  At the temple 
Lăo Wèi is visiting the Qìngfúgǀng in the Chinese quarter of Rangoon (YángguƗng), 
Burma (Myanmar). Qìngfúgǀng means, literally, ‘palace celebrating good fortune’. In 
China and Southeast Asia, temples are often considered palaces of the gods, hence the 
use of the term gǀng ‘palace’ in the name. [Sǌ xiƗnshƝng is based on a real person, a 
th
Sino-Burmese whose ancestors emigrated to Burma by way of Singapore early in the 20
century. Typical of Sino-Burmese, he speaks Hokkien (Mӿnnányԃ), Burmese 
(Miӽndiànyԃ), as well as some Mandarin.]

9.5 Colors 
The Chinese core color terms are the following: 

hóng
red 

 zӿ
 
purple; 
violet 

huáng 
yellow  

lԋ 
lán 
green  blue

 

hƝi 
bái 
black  white 

QƯng, a term that was applied to dark greens, blues and some browns – the colors of earth 
and sky – in earlier Chinese, appears in certain phrases, such as qƯngcài ‘green 
vegetables’ or qƯngshƗn-lԋshuӿ  ‘green mountains and blue waters’ (a standard description 
for lush scenery). 

When used to modify a noun, color terms are often suffixed with sè, from yánsè 
‘color’: 

huángsè de 

hóngsè de 

zӿsè de 

lԋsè de 

lánsè de 

Secondary color terms have been formed by extending the meaning of words from 
other semantic domains, eg ‘grey’ from ‘ash’: 

huƯsè de 
ashes
 
> grey 

kƗfƝisè de 
coffee 
> dark brown 

zǀngsè de 
palm 
> brown 

chéngsè de 
orange 
> orange 


Not surprisingly, colors have rich cultural associations in China. Traditionally, red 
(the color of blood) is considered festive and auspicious, and for that reason, was adopted 
by the Communist Party. Doorway scrolls (duìlián) are written on red paper; presents are 
often wrapped in it. Charms (symbols on paper, sold in temples) were generally written 

18

on yellow paper. Only the emperor could wear yellow. White was associated with 

funerals.
