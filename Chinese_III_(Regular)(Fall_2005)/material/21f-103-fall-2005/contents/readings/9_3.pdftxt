9.6  Dialogue: buying a seal 
Seals, made of stone, jade, etc. are sold from street stands, in specialty shops and in 
department stores. When you buy, you select a blank first, then the characters are 
engraved in either standard script, or more often, in small seal script (xiӽozhuàn).

9.7  The BӼ (ԯ) construction 
In Chinese, shifting the positio n of objects – things affected or effected by the verb – may 
produce subtle shifts in meani ng that are either achieved in other ways in English, or not 
explicitly acknowledged at all. For example, in some cases the object (the thing affected 
– the window – in the following example) may follow the verb, much as in English: 

1 

Qӿng dӽkƗi chuƗnghu. 
Y΃jing d΁kƗi le. 

Open a window please.  [any window] 
[I] already have. 

Here the speaker is not designating a specific window – any window will do. But if th e 
speaker wants to indicate a specific window, then he is more likely to say: 

2 

Qӿng bӽ chuƗnghu dӽk  i. 
Ɨ 
Wǂ y΃jing b΁ tƗ d΁kƗi le. 

Please open the w indow. [a specific one] 
[I]’ve already opened it. 

Instructions that involve manipulation of particular items almost alw ays elicit the 
grammatical word bӽ (ԯ) [or its more formal counterpart, jiƗng (૟/୓)]. Bӽ, which 
derives from a verb meaning ‘to ta ke 
’, serve  to spotlight a following phrase referring t o 
s
an item that is to be moved, taken , br oken, prepared, hidden, painted, purged, promoted 
or otherwise affected or changed in some way. For that reason, bӽ  is typically associated 
with verb-combos (action plus result), or at very least, verb-le (action done) or a 
reduplicated verb (qiƝqie ‘cut up’). For the same reason, bӽ is not elicited by verbs lik e
xӿhuan or kàn, which do not have a similar effect on their objects: 

Wǂ hƟn xƱhuan nèi bù diànyƱng. 
Wǂ yƱjing kànwán-le nèi bƟn shǌ. 

I love that movie! [no bӽ] 
I’ve finished reading the book. [no bӽ] 

Nor does bӽ appear with potential verb combos, for which the effect is not actual, only 
imagined: 

21


Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin  

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

[no bӽ]
[with b ΁] 

TƗ nèi jiàn xiƗngzi wǂ nábuqӿlai. 
Wǂ bƗng nƱ b΁ tƗ náq΃lai. 

I can’t lift that suitc ase of hers. 
I’ll help you lift it. 

The bӽ phrase almost always refers to particular items, so that in many cases the 
difference between a sentence with bӽ and one without is, as examples 1 and 2 [above] 
show, a question of whether the object is definite (‘the window’) or not (‘a window’) . 
Other examples: 

3.	

Qӿng bӽ mén dӽkƗi.
 
 W΅ y΃jing b΁ mén d΁kƗi le. 

 

Please open the door.
I’ve already opened it. 

4.	

Yԁu diӽnr hƝi, qӿng bӽ dƝng dӽkƗi. 

It’s a bit dark, put the light on, please. 

DƝng huài le, d΁bukƗi. 

The light’s broken, [it] won’t go on. 

Nà, wԁmen bӽ zhuǀzi bƗndào 
chuƗnghu nàr, hӽo bu hӽo? 

Well then, let’s move the table over 
to the window, okay? 

Tài zhòng le, bƗnbudòng. 

It’s too heavy, [it] can’t be moved. 

 

Nà, bӽ táidƝng náguolai ba. 

Okay, then let’s bring the desk-lamp over 
here. 

5. 

Qӿng bӽ lóng nèi ge zì xiČ zài 
hƝibӽn shàng. 

Please write the character for dragon on 
the blackboard.

H΁o, w΅ b΁ lóng nèi ge zì xiČ zài 
hƝib΁n shàng le. 

Okay, I’ve written the character for dragon 
on the board. 

XiČ+de hČn hӽo. Xiànzài bӽ 
fèng zì xiČ zài hƝibӽn shàng. 

[You]’ve written [it] very nicely. Now write 
the character for phoenix on the board. 

H΁o, wǂ b΁ fèng n èi g e zì xiČ zài 
hƝib΁n shàng le. 

Okay, I’ve writ ten the character for phoenix 
on the blackboard. 

6.	

7.	

Shéi bӽ wԁ de píjiԃ hƝ le? 
Méi rén hƝ-le n΃ de píji·! 

Who drank my beer? 
No one’s drunk your beer! 

Nӿ xiƗn bӽ niúròu qiƝqie. 
ZČnme qiƝ, qiƝ piànr háishi 
qiƝ kuàir? 

First slice the beef. 
How? Into slices, or in to pieces? 

22

8.	

Qӿng bӽ zìxíngchƝ fàng zài 
xiӽoxiàng lӿ le. 

Please put your bike in the alley. 
[with le marking a ‘chang e of state’] 

Fàng zài xi΁oxiàng l΃ gòu 
Ɨnquán ma? 

Will it be safe enough if I put it there? 

Méi wènti, wԁ huì bƗng nӿ kƗn-zhe.	 No problem, I’ll help you to keep an e ye 
on it. 

Notes 

a) Example 8 suggests how the sense of the modern function and properties of b΁ 
can be adduced from ba’s original function as a verb meaning ‘take’, ie from 
‘Take your bicycle and put it in the a lley’ to ‘put your bicycle in the alley’. 
b) Note kƗn-zhe, with level tone on kƗn when it means ‘tend; watch over’ (still 
written ఘ), eg kƗn háizi ‘babysit children’. 

As a vestige of its verbal origins, bӽ can be directly negated or modified by 
adverbs: 

TƗ méi bӽ chuƗnghu dăkƗi.	

She didn’t open the windows. 

TƗmen yƱjing bӽ dǀngxi názԁu le.	

They’ve already taken the things out.

Bié bӽ shǌbƗo fàng zai zhuǀzi 
shàng. 

Don’t put [your] bookbags on the table. 

9.7.1	 Making tea 
Instructions are a prototypical site for ba-phrases, because instructions involve picking 
particular objects from  a set and doing things with them. Here, for example, are 
instructions for making a cup of tea. The master brewer makes reference to the following 
items: 

shuӿhú  huԁ  chábƝi
shuӿ	 
water	 kettle
 fire 
teacup 

 cháyè 
hé 
tea leaves  box 

bƝizi  gàizi 
cup 
top; a cover 

And the n performs the following operations on them – all of which involve complex 
verbs (or in one case, a verb followed by a zai-phrase). 

shƗok  i Ɨ 
dàojìn 
fàng zài 
          
  
pour-in  put in 
boil-open 

zhԃnbèihӽo 
prepare-well 

náchǌlai 
take-out 

fàngjìn 
put-in

gàishàng 
 cover-on 

And (s)he instructs as follows: 

Bӽ shuӿ dàojìn shuӿhú lӿ, bӽ shuӿhú fàng zài huԁ shàng, bӽ shuӿ shƗokƗi. 
Ránhòu bӽ chábƝi zhԃnbèihӽo, bӽ cháyè cóng cháyèhé lӿ náchǌlai, fàngjìn 

23 

Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin  

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

chábƝi lӿ, bӽ shƗokƗi le de shuӿ dàojìn bƝizi lӿ, ránhòu bӽ bƝizi de gàizi 
gàishàng; liӽng fƝn zhǀng yӿhòu nӿ jiu kČyӿ hƝ le. 

Notes 

Dàojìn ‘pour-into’ and fàngjìn ‘put-into’ are both followed by places: dà ojìn 
shuӿhú lӿ; fàngjìn chábƝi lӿ. In such cases lái or qù is either postponed un til after 
the place (dàojìn shuӿhú lӿ qù), or as here, simply omitted. 

Exercise 4 
Paraphrase the following in Chinese: 
It’s rath er late – almost time for dinner. In the living room, there are a couple of students 
sitting on the sofa, one tall with blond hair, one short with black; b oth are wearing 
glasses. In front of them is a table; and laid out on the table are a set of boxes (yí tào hézi) 
of different colors (bù tóng yánsè) and different sizes (bù tóng dàxiӽo). The tall guy picks 
up the large st red box and puts the smaller yellow one inside it. Then the shorter guy 
picks up the green box and puts it in th e yellow one. When they’ve finished putting all 
the boxes (suԁyԁu de hézi) back, they stand up, and walk out. That’s it! Nothing else.

appropriate place to continue the complex verb survey. First a review exercise.

latter with inserted bu  or de): w án and hӽo ‘finish’, dào and zháo ‘manage to; succeed in’,

9.8.1  Position of objects 
As noted earlier, bӽ is associated with manipulation or other kinds of actions that affect 
the position or integrity of objects: 

TƗ bӽ bӿ náqӿlai le. 
TƗ bӽ huà náxiàlai le. 

She picked up the pen. 
He lifted the painting down. 

However, an indefinite object (one that is new to the discourse – and in English typically 
preceded by an ‘indefinite article’ su ch as ‘a~an’ or ‘some’) often appears after the verb 
combination. Lái  and qù, whose function is to indicate direction towards or away from 
the speaker, are often – but n ot always – pos tponed u ntil after the object.

TƗ náqӿ bӿ lai le. 

She picked up a pen. 

Wԁ xiӽngbuqӿ tƗ de míngzi [lai] le. 

I can’t remember his name. 

9.8.2  More verb complements 
e
eans ‘live’, combin  s with verbs such as jì 
a) Zhù, which as a verb m 
and tíng ‘stop’ to convey permanence: 

‘note’, ná ‘hold’,

I can never remember his phone number. 

TƗ de diànhuà hàomӽ wԁ lӽo 
jìbuzhù! 
TƗ hČn cǀngmíng, nӿ wènbuzhù tƗ!  He’s smart, you won’t stump him!
Got it? 
Názhù le ma?
Wԁ nábuzhù!  
JiƝzhù! / JiƝzhù l e! 
Catch it! / Got it! 
Zhànzhù, bú yào dòng! Jԃqӿ shԁu lai!  Stay still, don’t move. Put your han ds up!

 

 

I can’t hold it!

a) Wènbuzhù, literally ‘ask-not-stick’; or wènbudӽo ‘ask-not-collapse’.

b) JiƝ ‘join’, as in Xièxie nӿmen lái jiƝ wԁmen .

c) Dòng ‘move’, yù ndòng de dòng.

d) Jԃ ‘raise’; cf jԃzhòng ‘lift weights’ or jԃxíng ‘take place. For ‘put your hands

up’, a version with bӽ is also possible: Bӽ shԁu jԃqӿlai!


 

 

Notes 

 

b) KƗi as a verb complement means ‘open’: 

KƗibukƗi ~ dӽbukƗi chuƗnghu. 

I can’t open the wi ndow. 

ZԁukƗi! Zhèr méiyou nƱ de shìr. 

Get lost; this doesn’t concern you.

Yú líbukƗi shuӿ ya, guƗ líbukƗi 
yƗng; rénmín qúnzhòng líbukƗi 
gòngchӽndӽng! 

Fish can’t leave the water, melons can’t 
leave the vine; the people can’t be separated 
from the Communist Party !

c) Shàng and xià, in addition to their literal meanings in the directional complements 
xiàlai and shànglai, xiàqu and shàngqu, also form single syllable complements: 

Bӽ qiƗng fàngxià! 

Put the gun down! 


Zhèi jiƗn jiàoshì zuòbuxià 
sƗnshí ge rén.


This classroom won’t seat 30. 


Zuòxià ba. 

Why don’t you sit down. 

Wԁ wàng le dàishàng biӽo. 

I forgot to put my watch on. 

TƗ pà tƗ kӽobushàng dàxué. 

He’s afraid he won’t pass the university 
entrance exam. 

TƗ zhƝn kČ’ài; wǂ yƱjing àishàng 
tƗ le!
 
 
 
 

She’s so cute; I’ve already fallen in love 
with her!

 

XiƗngzi tài xiăo le, fàngbuxià 
dǀngxi.
 
 
 

This case’s too small; I can’t get the 
things in. 

d) Zԁu ‘leave’ appears as a complement meaning ‘away’: 

TƗmen yӿjing bƗnzԁu le. 

They’ve already moved away [from here]. 

Shéi bӽ wԁ de yàoshi názԁu le? 

Who’s gone off with my keys? 

DǀngtiƗn lái le, niӽo dǀu fƝizԁu le.  Winter’s here, and the birds have all flown. 
Méi guƗnxi, ni΁o shi sìhài zhƯyƯ, 
Never mind, birds are one of the 4 pests, [if] 
z΅u jiu z΅u ba. 
they’ve gone, they’ve gone. 

9.8.3  Specialize d forms
a) A number of complements appear only in the potential form. QƱ – qƱlái de qƱ – is one. 
As a complement, it shows a considerable shift in meaning to ‘worthy of’ or ‘afford to’: 

DuìbùqƱ.

 

 

 

Sorry. (‘face-not-worthy’) 

Aiya, xiànzài BƟijƯng de shƝnghuó  Gosh the cost of living in Beijing is 
fèiyong tài gƗo le, wǂ kČ zhùbuqƱ! 
too high – I can’t afford to live here. 

26 

Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin  

Julian K. Wheatley, MIT 

Yànwǀ, yúchì zhèi lèi de dǀngxi 
tài guì le; wǂ chƯbuqƱ! 

Things like birds nest soup and shark fin 
are too expensive; I can’t afford to eat them. 

b) It is also possible to choose to use the potential framework but not to commit to a 
particular complement. In such case, a default complement, liӽo (written with the same 
character as le, ೫) is available. Unlike most of the other verb complements, it combines 
with al most any action verb. It usually suggests ‘more than one can be expected to do’: 

Dǀngxi tài duǀ le, wǂ yí ge rén 
zƟnme nádeliӽo ne? 
 Wǂ lái bƗng nƱ ná ba. 

[I have] too many things; how can I carry 
them all by myself?
Let me help you.

 

Zhème duǀ cài, wǂ yí ge rén 
zƟnme c hƯdeliӽo ne? 

Such a lot of dishes, how can I eat them 
all by myself? 

Chàbuliӽo duǀshao.	

ChƝ tài duǀ le, wǂmen w ǎ diӽn 
dàobuliӽo.
 
 
 
D΁ ge diànhuà gàosu tƗmen, 
hăo bu hăo. 

There’s hardly any di fference; [they’]re 
more or less the sa me. (‘lack-not-able 
much’) 

Too many cars, we won’t be able to 
make it by 5. 
Phone them and let them know, okay? 

c) Semantic extensions 

Verb co mplements, particularly the directional ones, often have ex tended meanings. Qӿlái ,

for example, which as a directional complement means ‘up [here]’ (eg zhànqӿlai), also

functions much more abstractly, in the sense of ‘when it comes to [doing]’: 


Zhèi jiàn shì shuǀqӿlai róngyì, 
zuòqӿlai nán. 

This is easy to talk about, but tough to do. 

Zhèi tiáo lù, kànqӿlai hƟn jìn, 
zuqӿlai hƟn yuăn. 

This route looks short, but when you walk it, 
it’s quite far.

 

ShàoxƯnghuà tƯngqӿlai hČn xiàn g 
Shànghӽihuà. 

Shaoxing dialect sounds like Shanghainese . 
[‘when you come to listen to it…]’

Notes 

a) XiàngshƝng ‘cross talk’, a popular style of comedy that involves a lot of 

language play; usually involving two people, one of whom plays straight to the

wit of the other. 

b) Sòng ‘to present; escort’; sòng, like gƟi, can take both person and thing as 

objects. More often, however, it is followed by gƟi: sòng gƟi; cf. mài gČi ‘sell to 

s/o’ (but with mài, gƟi is not optional).

c) XiƗn, Adv ‘first’. 

d) XiӽoxƯn ‘careful (small-heart)’; cf. fàngxƯn ‘take care (put-heart)’.

e) The routine ends in a play on kӽo ‘to test’ and kӽo ‘to bake’; hú is a SV 

meaning ‘to burn [food]’, but in slang, it also means ‘to fail an exam’.
