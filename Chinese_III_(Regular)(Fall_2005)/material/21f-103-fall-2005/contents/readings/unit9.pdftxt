9.1  More modification 
As noted earlier, de is typically a mark of modification: zuótiān de bàozhi ‘yesterday’s 
newspaper’; zuótiān mǎi de huǒchē piào ‘the train tickets [we] bought yesterday’. Such 
modifying phrases serve to pin down a particular item: not any bàozhi but zuótiān de 
bàozhi; not any lí but líkāi de lí, ‘the li of likai’. Often, definitions have the same form: 
 
lăoshī:   
 
gōngrén: 
 
xuéshēng: 
 
 
 
English speakers need to pay special attention to de-patterns, since they often show quite 
a different order of modifier and modified: 
 

zài xuéxiào jiāoshū de <rén>. 
zài gōngchăng gōngzuò de <rén>. 
zài xuéxiào dúshū de <rén>. 

A chef is someone [who cooks in a restaurant].

Máo Dàwéi is with the mother of one of his friends (whom he calls bómŭ ‘wife of 
father’s elder brother; auntie’). She is a photographer (shèyǐngshī). They are looking at 
photographs taken in the 30s when Máo Zédōng was in Yán’ān (in northern Shǎnxī).

Not the Great Wall, the Long March, 
[when] the Red Army marched  
from Jingangshan to Yan’an.  

Zhu De was a general, who took part in 
in the Long March. 

The Snows were American reporters, 
right?

Notes 

Exactly! Zhu De took part in the Long 
March. 

a) Yán’ān: a city in a remote part of northern Shǎnxī; from 1937-47, it was the 
capital of the communist controlled part of China. 
b) Zhū Dé, 1886 – 1976; close associate of Mao, and at the inauguration of the 
PRC, he was the Commander-in-Chief of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).

c) Zhōu Ēnlái, 1899 – 1976, Premier under the PRC. 
d) Sīnuò: Edgar Snow (1905 – 72), an American reporter, author of Red Star over 
China, based on interviews with Mao and others conducted at Yan’an after the 
Long March. His first wife, Helen Foster Snow, also a journalist, accompanied 
him for part of his stay in Yan’an. 
e) fūfù ‘husband and wife’. Level toned fū ‘man’ appears as the first syllable of 
fūren ‘Mrs.’ (ie ‘man’s person’); falling toned fù ‘woman’ appears in words such 
as fùkē ‘gynecology (woman-section)’. 
f) Guójì yǒurén: a designation for foreigners who helped Chinese during hard 
times, especially in the 50s and 60s, when China was most isolated from the rest 
of the world. 
g) Bái Qiū’ēn: Norman Bethune (1890 – 1939), a Canadian physician who died of 
blood poisoning while serving as a doctor in the communist area. Mao wrote an 
essay on him that was once required reading in China.  
h) dàifu: ‘doctor; physician’; cf. yīsheng. 
i) jiāngjun ‘military officer; general’ 
j) cānjiā: ‘to join; participate in; take part in’. 
k) Cháng Zhēng ‘The Great March’. In 1934, the Communist forces retreated 
from their base areas in rural Jiāngxī (known as the Jiangxi Soviet) under military 
pressure from the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party). They marched westwards at 
first, and then in a great arc northwards, ending up in Yan’an in 1935, a journey 
of almost 10,000 kilometers. 
l) Jǐnggāng Shān: The Jinggang Mountains in Jiangxi. 
m) Hóngjūn: ‘the Red army’ 
n) yǐwéi: ‘think; believe [s/t that turns out to be incorrect] (take to be)’.

9.2  Clothes 
2
5 years ago, the predominant color of clothing in the PRC was white for shirts, and dark 
lue or dark grey for most everything else, though on occasion, youth wore red scarves to 
b
sh
ow their political loyalty. Men, in those days, wore Mao suits, a type of attire originally 
romoted by Sun Yat-sen earlier in the 20th century to provide a formal dress for civil 
p
rvants that looked modern but not completely western. So-called Mao suits are still 
se
alled Zhōngshānzhuāng
c
 ‘Zhongshan tunics’ or Zhōngshānfú ‘Zhongshan clothes’ in 
hinese. In Mandarin, Sun Yat-sen is usually known not by the Mandarin rendition of 
C
S
un Yat-sen, Sūn Yìxiān
, but by his alternate name Sūn Zhōngshān; Zhongshan, on the 
c
oast of Canton province, was his birthplace.  
 

Beginning in the late 1980s, clothing styles started to change in the PRC, and 
nowadays, there is little in the way of
 dress to distingu
ish people on the street in, say, 
Chengdu, from their counterparts in Chicago or Hamburg. However, Chinese styled 
garments (actually modern versions of more traditional garments), such as the following, 
are still seen: 
 
traditional  mián’ǎo 
cotton padded jacket 
cháng páo<r>  long scholar’s robe 
men’s short coat 
mǎguà<r> 
qípáo<r> 
‘cheongsam’; woman’s long gown (with slit skirt) 

Zhōngguó chuántǒng de yīfu yǒu

děngděng. 
 
 
 

 
 
 

Chinese traditional clothing includes 
padded jackets, robes, short coats
,  
cheongsams, etc. 

Ordinary types of clothing are listed below. Most types of clothing are counted by

¥1,500. 

9.3  Bargaining, the way the Chinese might do it. 
Recall the earlier material (especially in Unit 8) on shopping and bargaining. Here is a 
more sophisticated dialogue that is envisionied as taking place between locals, so the only 
likely role for a foreign student is as a bystander, listening in. Because it takes place 
between Chinese, it is colloquial, and incorporates a number of quite idiomatic 
expressions, which are explicated in the notes. It is worth trying to enact the Chinese 
roles, but to be effective, you will need to sustain a convincing level of fluency. 
 
Běijīng: Yǐ runs a shop that sells leather jackets; Jiǎ is a female customer. 
 
Jiǎ:  Lǎobǎn, zhèi jiàn pídàyī duōshao qián?  Proprietor, how much is this leather coat?

Of the

le (in its post-verbal manifestation) more recently, but zhe has been almost completely

reason for this. Most of the language presented so far has 
avoided

nner states. Zhe is rare in such language. Zhe serves 
primari
ly to set the scene (‘the door’s open, there’s a vase on the table, the blinds are 
drawn’) and to indicate the va
rious configurations of the actors (‘a man’s standing 
at the 
e and holding a pipe in his hands’). Like guo and le, zhe

complements (such as wán or guòlai).

9.4.3  Ongoing acts versus persisting states 
s tend to associate V-zhe with English V-ing: zhànzhe
First impression
 ‘standing’; zuòzhe 
itting’. However, while it is true that many cases of V-zhe do correspond to V-ing in 
‘s
nglish, the reverse is not true: many cases of V-ing do not correspond to V-zhe. The 
E
s V-ing for both ongoing acts, and for the ongoing states 
reason for this is that English use
that result:  
 
 
 
 
 
 

Tā bú dòng, jiu zài nàr zhàn-zhe ne. 
 
[state] 

She’s not moving, she’s  
 
just standing there.  

She’s standing up right now.    

i zhànqǐlai ne. [act] 

Tā zhèng zà

Zhèng zài
 supports the directional complement, qǐlai, to underscore the fact that 
the action is happening before our eyes – it’s 
ongoing; while the presence of zhe
 after 
zhàn indicates that the standing is persistent. While both are in a sense ongoing, Chinese 
distinguishes them as ongoing act versus persisting state. 
 
Recall that ongoing or recent actions are often explicitly marked by zài placed in 
the adverbial position right before the verb: 
 

They’re still bathing.  
What have you been doing lately? 
They’ve been studying Chinese daily.

In fact, for some northern speakers, the pattern can be further reinforced by a following

The fact that zài may co-occur with zhe may seem strange, since in the last section, V-zhe 
was viewed in contrast to the zai-V pattern. But apparently, in some
 cases the two notions 
f ongoing and persisting can complement one another. The range of the V-ing form in 
o
English (the so-called progressive tense)
 – which includes ongoing actions (putting on) 
and persistent states (wearing) – is, after all, a precedent for associating the 
two notions.

Q , a term that was applied to dark greens, blues and some browns – the colors of earth 
īng
and sky
 – in e rlier Chinese, appears in certain phrases, such as qī gcài ‘green 
n
a
vegetables’ or qīngshān-lǜshuǐ  ‘green mountains and blue waters’ (a standard description 
for lush scenery).  
 

When used to modify a noun, color terms are often suffixed with sè, from yánsè 
‘color’: 
 
huángsè de 

hóngsè de 

lánsè de  

lǜsè de

Secondary color terms have been formed by extending the meaning of words from
 
antic domains, eg ‘grey’ from ‘ash’:

Instructions that involve manipulation of particular items almost alw
ays elicit the 
rammatical word bǎ
g
 (把) [or its more formal counterpart, jiāng (將/将)]. Bǎ, which 
ke
o 
derives from a verb meaning ‘to ta
’, serve  to spotlight a following phrase referring t
s
en, prepared, hidden, painted, purged, promoted 
, br
an item that is to be moved, taken
ok
r otherwise affected or changed in some way. For that reason, bǎ
o
 is typically associated 
with verb-combos (action plus result), or at very least, verb-le (action done) or a 
reduplicated verb (qiēqie ‘cut up’). For the same reason, bǎ is not elicited by verbs lik
e 
xǐhuan
 or kàn, which do not have a similar effect on their objects: 
 
Wŏ hĕn xĭhuan nèi bù diànyĭng.  
Wŏ yĭjing kànwán-le nèi bĕn shū.  

I love that movie! [no bǎ]

Nor does bǎ appear with potential verb combos, for which the effect is not actual, only 
imagined:

In Chinese, shifting the positio
produce subtle shifts in meani
ng that are either achieved
 in other ways in English, or not 
explicitly acknowledged at all. For example, in some cases the object (the thing affected 
–
 the window – in the following example) may follow the verb, much as in English:

Here the speaker is not designating a specific window – any window will do. But if th

the position or integrity of objects: 
 
 
 
 
However, an indefinite object (one that is new to the discourse – and in English typically
 
preceded by an ‘indefinite article’ su
ch as ‘a~an’ or ‘some’) often appears after the verb 
ombination. Lái

9.8.3  Specialize
d forms 
a) A number of complements appear only in the potential form. Qĭ – qĭlái de qĭ – is one.

ift in meaning to ‘worthy of’ or ‘afford to’:

Notes 

 

 

a) Xiàngshēng ‘cross talk’, a popular style of comedy that involves a lot of 
language play; usually involving two people, one of whom plays
 straight to the 
wit of the other. 
b) Sòng ‘to present; escort’; sòng
, like gĕi, can take both person and thing as 
objects. More often, however, it is followed by gĕi: sòng gĕi; cf. mài gěi ‘sell to 
s/o’ (but with mài, gĕi is not optional).  
c) Xiān, Adv ‘first’. 
d) Xiǎoxīn ‘careful (small-heart)’; cf. fàngxīn ‘take care (put-heart)’. 
e) The routine ends in a play on kǎo ‘to test’ and kǎo ‘to bake’; hú is a SV 
meaning ‘to burn [food]’, but in slang, it also means ‘to fail an exam’.

9.11  Destination and goal: VERB + dào, zài or gěi  
There is a distinction to be made between combinations that consist, on the one hand, of a
ain verb and a complement verb (zuòwán
m
, zhǔnbèihǎo) or compound complement 
(n
áchūqu
, zhànqǐlai) and, on the other hand, combinations that consist of a main verb and 
a complement phrase (bān dào xiāngxià qu, wàng zài jiā lǐ). The former elaborates the 
verbal event in terms of its completion, success or direction, but in other respects, the 
product remains a verb and can end a sentence or be modified by le: Yǐjing kànwán l
e. It 
can also be made potential: zuòbuwán; nádechūlai. Since the combination remains a 
unitary verb, it is written without a space.  
 

The addition of dào, zài or gěi (all often untoned) to a verb is quite a different 
matter. It requires a goal to be expressed: a location in the case of the first two (kāi dào 
ménkǒur; fàng zài wàitou), a person in the c
ase of the third (sòng gěi péngyou). The 
sulting combinations (kāi dào
re
, fàng zài, sòng gěi, etc.) do not act like unitary verbs. 
le 
nnot stand alone; they cannot be further modified by verb-le (though sentence-
They ca
may appear at the foot of the sentence); and they do not permit the insertion of de or bu to 
form the potential. For this reason, they are written with a space between. 
 

 

Another feature of the three verbs, dào, zài and gěi, is that they not only follow 
main verbs to introduce various ‘goals’, but each can also appear, as it turns out, before 
their associated verbs as coverbs. The options are as follows:

Chao’s grammar (1967) is exceptional in devoting some five pages to the topic. 
Interjections are quite frequent in informal speech, and need to be considered. A good 
place to look for them in written form is comics and advertisements (though you will 
have to conduct a survey of native speakers to see how the interjections are actually 
ronounced). Here is an example from the label of a bottle of a popular brand of fruit 
p

Shuǐjīng  Pútao – (嗯) hǎo hē!

9.15  On apologies 
In 2001 a US spy plane, flying near to the coast of China, was involved in a collision with 
a Chinese jet th  was shadowing it. The Chinese pilot was killed, and the US plane was 
at
badly d
amaged and had to land on Hainan Island. A poorly planned response from t
he US 
side led the Chinese leaders to demand a formal apology. The Americans were only 
willing to express regret. Professor Leo Ou-f
 Lee of Harvard wrote a short article on 
an
the issue of the apology that was 
printed in the Boston Gl
obe. It is reproduced in part 
here: 
 

“Two days ago, US Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said  the United States was

fault….  The  Chinese  language  has  several  words  for  apology,  noted  Leo  Ou-fan 
Lee,  a  professor  of Chinese  literature  at Harvard University. China  is  demanding 
that  the  United  States  give  ‘zhèngshì  dàoqiàn’,  ‘a  formal  apology’  that 
acknowledges  that  the  speaker  is  extremely  sorry  for  having  done  something 
wrong  that  harmed  the  listener.  A  softer  alternative  is  ‘bàoqiàn’,  which  means 
‘deep  and  sincere  regret’  or  to  be  ‘apologetic’.  Bush's  expression  of  ‘regret’  last 
week  for  the  loss  of  the  pilot  translates  as  the milder  ‘yíhàn’,  which  implies  that 
the speaker  is not at fault.”   [Indira A.R. Lakshmanan,  in  the Boston Globe, April

An excerpt fro
m a longer rhyme containing advice for healthy living, distributed on 
sheets of paper
e been 
 at a Chinese temple in Rangoon (Burma). The rhyme seems to hav
inspired by a genre represented best by the ‘Household Maxims’ (Zhìjiā Géyán) of Zhū 
n [sic]), 1617 – 1689, that
 are often 
Yòngchún (tra
ditionally romanized as Chu Yo
ngshu
ac. The latter,
found in editio
 less 
 written in classical style, has a
ns of the Chinese alman
perky rhythm. It starts off: 
 

Límíng jí qǐ, 
 
Dawn then rise, 
Sǎsǎo tíngchú   
sprinkle-sweep outer-porch 
yào nèi wài zhěngqí.  make inside-and-outside neat.  

Jí hūn biàn xī,   
guānsuǒ mén hù, 
bì qīnzì jiǎndiǎn. 
 
 

When evening [comes] then rest, 
close-and-lock doors, 
must oneself check-carefully. 

     Healthy living, Shanghai subway.
