***** Course Highlights *****
This course features the third part of a downloadable textbook, available in
readings and also includes audio files of its main conversational and narrative
material, all available in study_materials. It can be used as the basis for a
taught course, for self-instruction, or for elementary-to-intermediate review.
***** Course Description *****
This is the third of the four courses (Chinese I through IV) in MIT's regular
(non-streamlined) Chinese curriculum. The four make use of the textbook,
Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin (unpublished, but available
online), to which are added various supporting materials as needs arise. The
foundation level covers core grammar, linguistic culture, basic conversation,
the principles of the writing system, and elementary reading. Reading is
primarily in the simplified character set that is the standard on the Mainland,
but also in the traditional set that is still standard in Taiwan and many
overseas communities.
All four subjects in the foundation level are (Chinese I and II) or soon will
be (Chinese IV) available on OCW. Students who have advanced through Chinese I
and II to reach this level, as well as those entering at Chinese III, should
review at least the late material in Chinese II before proceeding. To
facilitate review, as well as to orient students who are new to these
materials, highlights from all the units in Chinese I and II and a list of the
characters formally introduced in Character lessons 1-6 are included in the
readings section of this course.
**** Chinese Sequence on OCW ****
OpenCourseWare now offers a complete sequence of four Chinese language courses,
covering beginning to intermediate levels of instruction at MIT. They can be
used not just as the basis for taught courses, but also for self-instruction
and elementary-to-intermediate review.
The four Chinese subjects provide the following materials: an online textbook
in four parts, J. K. Wheatley's Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in
Mandarin; audio files of the main conversational and narrative material in this
book; and syllabi and day-by-day schedules for each term.
