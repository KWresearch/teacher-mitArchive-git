This section features the daily_assignments for the course. All the assignments
rely heavily on texts available in the readings section as well as audio files
available in the study_materials section. For Part 1, all review materials from
Chinese II can be found either in the readings section or in 21F.102/21F.152.
***** Overview *****
In the following schedule, assignments are listed in sequence (Day 1, Day
2...), one for each day of class (with intervening days ignored). Note that the
dates given for each assignment are the dates on which the assignments are due
(for day 5, etc.); in other words, the assignments are preparation for class.
The daily assignments indicate the pace of the class and the way the different
materials are coordinated. They should be interpreted as additions to a process
that involves review, preview and consolidation; so for example, the assignment
for day #14 begins 'Unit 8.5.3 (DuÅ fÃ ng ...)', which is a signal to get to
know the construction by examining the examples so that it can be practiced in
class and eventually incorporated in the conversational repertoire.
***** Abbreviations Key *****
Assignments make reference to sections within Unit or Characters material (e.g.
Unit 7.3, Chars 7.4.2) and to exercises (Unit 9 excercise 3). The reader, Lady
in the Painting, is cited as Lady (e.g. Lady pp. 14-16).
