                                           We will focus on the concepts of
                                           operations strategy decision
2      Frameworks for strategy and the     categories. We will also explore how

                                           We will explore the success of a

                                           applied to the case.
                                           We will build on ideas from
4      Value chain dynamics and operations Clockspeed,and discuss the lens of
       decisions                           value chain dynamics for developing
                                           an operations strategy.
                                           Long known as the "industry of
                                           industries," the automotive industry
                                           was a petri dish for many of the
5      Value chain dynamics: Lessons from  most influential innovations in
       the auto industry                   operations and management. We will
                                           look at the industry history and
                                           contrast its glory years to the
                                           challenges of today.
                                           We will explore the operations model
                                           and business model of Southwest
                                           Airlines compared with the
       Enterprise architecture and         traditional airlines. Adding in
6      operations strategy                 parallel comparisons in the auto and
                                           airframe industries will drive an
                                           integrated discussion of enterprise/
                                           value chain architecture and
                                           operations strategy.

                                           We will explore the importance of
8      Business processes                  business processes such as design
                                           and development, order fulfillment,

                                           We will explore the questions of the
9      Process technology decisions and    role of technology and how one
       multiple plants                     manages technology across multiple
                                           plants.

       Facilities strategies and           In this session we will develop an
11     globalization; Comparisons of plant approach for a multi-facilities
       productivity                        strategy on a global basis.
                                           Based on the cases from the previous
       Summary lecture on facilities       classes, we will try to develop a
12     strategy and globalization          formal method for developing a
                                           facilities strategy on a global
                                           basis.

                                           this class.
                                           We will explore how IT decisions
14     Information systems and the impacts relate to strategy and we will
       of the electronic economy           explore how Amazon uses IT in its
                                           core business and new businesses.

                                           operations. In this class, we will
                                           explore the importance of planning
                                           scheduling and operating systems,
       Competing on cost versus competing  such as the Toyota production system
17     on availability                     and look at an example of where lean
                                           is an integral part of strategy. We
                                           will then explore how and whether
                                           there is a tradeoff between cost and
                                           availability. We will Herb Spivak,

       Competing on cost versus competing  innovativeness. We will consider
18     on features and innovativeness      these two companies, which also
                                           illustrate different approaches to
                                           quality and possible tradeoffs with
                                           cost versus innovativeness.
                                           For this session, we will examine
                                           the home building industry, in part
