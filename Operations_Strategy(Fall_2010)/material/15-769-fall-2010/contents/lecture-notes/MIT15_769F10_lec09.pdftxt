Factors in automation

 Business issues such as flexibility and fit with 
strategy
 Operational issues such as repeatability and precision 
and effect on performance drivers such as time to 
market (e.g Pharmaceutical)
 Regulatory issues
 Social issues such as technological environment and 
workforce implications
 Labor costs
 Sources of improvement and performance drivers

Intel and copy exactly





Run multiple sites identically to lead plant
 Process parameters
 Equipment sets
 Maintenance
 Training
 Specifications/documentation
Started when fab start-up yields lagged 
behind development fabs

Copy exactly requires 
additional structure

 Structure
 Joint engineering teams and control boards
 Senior management review
 Problem is problem for entire team
 Issues?

Standardization factors

 Product standardization (does it vary by 
market)
 Stability of technology (do new technologies 
leapfrog or evolve)
 Basis for learning (technology or worker 
based)
 Levels of volume (eg cars in Brazil)
 Ranges of technologies and impact of labor 
(can you use manual at low volumes)
