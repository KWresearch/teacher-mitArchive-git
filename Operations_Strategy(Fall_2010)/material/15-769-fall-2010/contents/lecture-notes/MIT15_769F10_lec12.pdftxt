and Globalization

Lecture 12

Summary lecture on facilities 
strategy and globalization

• Conclusions from ITT, Applichem, etc.

• Strategic and other factors 

• An integrated approach

•

Impacts of globalization

• New paradigms for the global environment

Issues from BYD and Applichem

• Fit with strategy

• Focus of plants

• Scale and cost

• Standardization and labor costs

• Means of evaluation and plant roles

• Sourcing and allocation models

• Access to R&D

drivers

• Raw material access  (e.g.wood products)

• Distributed production for heavy products

• Warehouses for commodities because of 
transportation scale

• Customer service requirements

1. Different process steps and scale, significant logistics

– Central stage 1, decentralized stage 2

2. Significant central R&D

– Central plant for at least early life cycle

3. Significant product flexibility

– Decentralized satellite plants for some stages

11

A General Approach

• Develop a strategy and appropriate means of focus

• Using data, benchmarking, and analysis of technology, develop 
scale curves

•

Identify major decision choices and service requirements 
covering plant and process options

• Do the analysis

12

Case Study: 
Worldwide Consumer Goods Manufacturer

• 25 product groups

• 10 production locations

• Variety of product values and weights

• Over capacity

• Lack of focus

• Significant tax issues

Why Separate?

Approach

• Scale

• Capacity

• Tax laws

• Focus

• Relative 
technological 
complexity

14

• Cross sectional analysis

• Tax analysis

• Model of variable costs

• Detailed analysis of actual 
fixed costs

Solution:

• Move “light” products to tax havens

• Better focus facilities by product group

Globalization Adds Some 
Additional Complexities

•

Increase in worldwide exports 

• Business level trends       

– New technologies such lower-scale, higher-skill level 
manufacturing systems including FMS systems

– JIT systems that also underscore the need for sophisticated vendor 
infrastructure

– TQM and organizational learning

– Competitive factors that focus on customization, rapid product 
development, and quick response

– The breakdown of intercompany barriers

15

Globalization Complexities       (cont’d)

• Macro level trends

– Large, sophisticated overseas markets with local needs

– Non-tariff barriers

– Regionalized trading economies

• Variable factor costs – Static and Dynamic differences

• Longer lead times

16

Global Strategies Emphasize
Some Additional Factors

• Global product volumes and life cycles

• Decentralized network based on regional presence

•

Infrastructure versus cost

– Work force capabilities

– Vendors

– Transportation and communication

• Extra plants and capacity to build flexibility for exchange rate 
risks

• Flexibility in short, medium, and long term

Summary

• Methods for analyzing focus, scale flow, etc.

•

Impact of new markets and technologies

• Global product design and flow patterns

• Flexibility

• Factor costs

• Other things we need to consider in more detail

– Outsourcing and offshoring questions in globalization

– Longer lead times

22

For those of you interested
in details, formulation for general case

where f is the unit usage of product l

is zero or one, forcing constraint

Could also have shared cap at plants.  With no warehouses, define 
plant variables to go to customers directly.  Can add another level for 
sourcing or two stages of plants.
