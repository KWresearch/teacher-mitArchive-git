Hammer’s Process Concept
PROCESS: an organized group of 
related tasks that work together to 
create a result of value

end-to-end work
•Some common processes
- order fulfillment
- procurement
- product development
- quality management

PROCESS

CUSTOMERS

cross-functional, outcome-focused

Process Orientation 

Process:  An organized set of related tasks that 
come together to create a result of value
(e.g., order fulfillment process, product development process)
Value-Added Work:
Necessary tasks the customer will pay for
(e.g., assemble the product, design improved performance, reduce cost)
Non-Value-Added Work:
Necessary tasks the customer will NOT pay for
(e.g., update inventory records, install MRP, balance the books)
Waste:
Unnecessary tasks the customer will NOT pay for
(e.g., rework improper assemblies, resolve manufacturing-sales disputes)

Principles of High Performance Process 
Design
•A process should be performed by as few people 
as possible to minimize handoffs

•Strive for simplicity
non-value-adding work <==> complexity

•Structure in terms of alternatives rather than 
exceptions triage keeps the basic flows clean

Recognizing a Process Enterprise

• Teams are the norm
as opposed to an occasional exception 
• Workers are professionals with broad roles, 
responsibility, and decision-making authority
• Measurement is taken seriously 
on an end-to-end basis 
• Supervisors act as coaches
developing people but not managing their work
• Structure revolves around processes w/ process owners

•   Teams are supported by the
-infrastructure:  facilities & systems, and
-culture: customer orientation, sharing, 
accountability, discipline

Adapted from M. Hammer

Process Design Mindset
• Maintain the customer's perspective 
(create process metrics to support customer view)

• Seek out process leverage points

(what would make a very big difference --pro or con?)

• Increase the value added 

(reengineer the product as well as the process)

• "Is it worth it?” 

(sensitivity to tradeoff)

• Always ask "why?” 

(what's the real purpose? --goal vs. mechanism)

• Keep things simple

(“complexity is the work of the devil”)

Reengineering Principles
1. Organize around outcomes, not tasks
2. Have those who use the output of a process 
perform the process
3. Subsume information-processing work into 
the real work that produces the information
4. Treat geographically dispersed resources 
as though they were centralized
5. Link parallel activities instead of integrating 
their results
6. Put the decision point where the work is 
performed, and build control into the 
process
7. Capture information once and at the source

Top Ten “Mistakes” in Reengineering (recast as 
“do’s”)
1. Understand the reengineering concept(s).
2.
Identify your processes.
3. Understand existing processes.  Don’t over analyze 
them.
4. “Serious” and committed leadership is critical.
5. Encourage aggressively creative ideas.
6. Use prototypes and experiments to test ideas.
7. Be fast.  Be focused.
8. Everything should be on the table.
9.
Implementation should be fast, improvisational, 
iterative.
10. Tend to the needs of your people.
