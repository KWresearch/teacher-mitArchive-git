Consider 3 alternatives for variable costs
1. Use all the information provided as manufacturing costs 
2. Use only:  Raw material costs

Direct labor, salary, and fringes +
1/2 utilities cost
3. Same as two but no duties

Some summary points
• Strategy issues
– Scale and cost issues
– Local issues (production, presence)
– Plant roles
– Flexibility
– Technology transfer
• Analysis issues
– Use of measures (plant and system)
– Role of fixed costs
– Optimization or allocation analysis
– Analyzing flexibility (e.g. scenario generation)
