- Elements are tightly synchronized

- Ex:  jjet enggine,, air pplane wing, micropprocessor

Modular product architectures feature

- Elements are interchangeable
Elements are interchangeable 
- Elements are individually upgradeable
- Element interfaces are standardized 
- System failures can be localized
System failures can be localized 
- Ex:  stereo system,  desktop PC, bicycle

Integral value-chain architecture 
features close proximity among its elements 
- Proximityy metrics: 	 Geoggrapphic,, Orgganizational 

Cultural, Electronic

- Example:  Toyota city
