Globalization and 
Outsourcing

The articles suggest a number of 
questions

• What do recent trends suggest for global strategies (e.g changes 
in Chinese sourcing)?

• What are strategies for competing in a developed country?  When 
should companies offshore?

• Can a company offshore (and or outsource) completely?

• How important are operations and manufacturing to advanced 
economies such as the US?

• What are the long-term macro effects – eg specific industries, US 
economy in general?   

•

In general, what are the implications for strategy?

First, some background

Some trends

• Employment in manufacturing has gone down from 50% to 14%
• A similar shift took place in agriculture.
• Can we (societies such as the U.S.) source goods from China and 
other locations?

This concept has been referred as the post-industrial economy.

Some problems with the post-industrial
economy

•  We did not export or shift out of agriculture - -
we automated it

•  We linked agriculture to a large number of 
jobs (e.g., processing, chemicals, and 
logistics); the same potential for linkage
exists in manufacturing

•  Services are by-products of an advanced economy

the importance of manufacturing

• The US still has nearly 25% of Manufacturing value added 
(UNIDO)

•

In general, high income economies have 73% of Manufacturing 
Value added and 76% of exports (World Bank 2006 data)

The other big trend:  Offshoring

Extent of Offshoring

• The extent of offshoring is enormous, particularly in the case 
of China
– China exported $1.2 trillion in 2009, with $296 billion to U.S. and a 
surplus of $273 billion (US-China business council)
– Labor cost range from 50 cents and up, with comparable 
differences for skilled designers and developers (China develops 5 
times U.S. engineers – New York Times)
– Walmart alone has a significant part of China’s exports and GDP

Extent of Offshoring 

(cont’d)

• Economists are split on how the latest trends affect developed 
countries: 
– Many cite the economics of comparative advantage
– Increased job loss arises from improved productivity (comparison 
with agriculture)
– Standards rise from importing very-low-cost goods
– Standards may go down for a number of reasons:
• Wages are driven down for skilled workers (software) and could 
extend to a large expanse of the workforce
• Export prices may decrease due to competition
– Disruptions caused by shifting

Trends in global sourcing

•

Increasing costs in China

• Quality issues “Two-thirds said cheap was the chief attribute of 
Chinese goods”- The Economist, Feb 21, 2009)

• Product problems, suicides etc.

• Questions about labor availability

• Emergence of new consumer markets in China and the other 
BRICS.

What are the implications of these types of trends

General Patterns of Development

• Compete on factor costs and industrialize rapidly

• Raise the standard of living and transition to higher-value 
innovative products

• Move out of competitive commodities

These patterns have occurred in Japan, Taiwan, Korea, 
Hong Kong, and Singapore

“When to Offshore?

• Let’s consider the two extreme options

– Offshore and chase the lowest factor costs

– Always produce where demand is – a home-based strategy

14

“Factor-Cost” Based Strategy

• Offshoring in general suggests a “factor-cost” based strategy
– Factor cost differences are enormous
– The larger supply chain compounds the differences
– Offshore locations are developing capabilities in higher value 
products
– While the full costs of global outsourcing need to be added, the 
differences are still often large
– The comparative advantage argument suggests focus on other 
industries

manufacturing companies

– And what will be the end game?

– What are the implications for specific industries

– What are the implications for public policy

– And what are the implications for company strategy

Some final thoughts

• Whether and where to offshore

• When to stay in developed countries

• The dynamics of offshoring

•

Importance of manufacturing and operations to both developed 
and developing countries
