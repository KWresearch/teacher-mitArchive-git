How do deal with variability?

 Sources?
 Distribution?
 Normal?
 Skewed?
 How to analyze?
 Percentile?
 85%?
 Cost of underage versus overage (extra capacity)

Normal distribution is an easy way to determine the appropriate 
demand levels

84% of area
Under curve
(Z=1)

Z
CSL
84% 1
90% 1.28
95% 1.64
2.33
99%.

Calculate required capacity as:
Average demand + z * standard deviation of demand

Concept:  Find percentile corresponding 
to cost balance point (critical fractile or 
percentile)

Area equal to percentile

Demand corresponding
To critical percentile

What percentile?

 Costs of not meeting demand are extremely large: $5,333,333 
per kg!
 Costs of extra capacity are large, but two orders of magnitude 
lower ($51,280 for a ten-year life)
 Use newsvendor approach of costs of underage and overage
 Co = Cost of overage, or cost of having one too many units 
of capacity
 Cu = Cost of underage, or cost of having one too few units 
of capacity
 Find z such that P(d<z) = Cu/(Co+Cu)
 For Genentech, this is 99.05%
 The high service level suggests maximum credible demand

Note that high services greatly increase 
capacity!

Summary issues

 Long lead times and (often) high 
financial impact make capacity a 
strategic priority
 Need to address risk of overage versus 
underage 
 Variability has a major impact and is not 
trivial
 Perhaps there is a hedging strategy
