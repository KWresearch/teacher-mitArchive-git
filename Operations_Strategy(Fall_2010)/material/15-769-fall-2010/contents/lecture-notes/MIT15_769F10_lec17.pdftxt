New Balance summary

• New Balance strategy and example of 
integration and fit

• Differentiating by operations in a 
commodity

• Competing on availability – tradeoffs with 
cost

• Strategic implications of JIT and lean 
operations

New Balance strategy

• Performance and fit (availability)

• Role of workforce

• Focus on retailer

• Process flexibility 

• Process proximity

• Tradeoff of manufacturing cost and 
inventory

Planning and materials (and in particular lean) 
are crucial strategically for two reasons

• They can fulfill specific goals (eg. 
availability and responsiveness)

• They can be the focus of performance in a 
specific area  (e.g. JIT can be the basis of 
performance goals)

Planning for responsiveness

• Small batch sizes

• Capacity (design and production)

• Inventory positioning (postponement)

• Proximity

Why is JIT (and lean) still  
relevant?
It is more than just a planning or control system
It is a complete system of manufacturing management and 
has changed the basis of competition
It affects a large number of strategic measures (quality, 
waste, turnover, productivity)
It can be the basis of a change in strategy or focus on a key 
goal
• The historical record is clear (even today) 
• The historical record relating inventory turns and cost is 
particularly startling.

But what is required?

• Leveling and predictability

• Rationalization of inventory locations

• Teamwork and synchronization

• Proximity

• Focusing on flow and not inventory

• Sharing benefits and improving entire 
supply chain, not making it adversarial

The strategic impact of JIT:
How does inventory affect efficiency?
