3 Private Information 

Private  information  on: 

•	 tastes,  productivity  or  income

insurance is smoother than with  lack of commitment

• 

no  bounds  to  hit  or  be  slack


Some  comments


• 

incentives 

→ 
static  intuition 

no  perfect  insurance


•	 dyanamic

use  present  and  future  consumption  for  incentives

→ 
“intertemporal  tie-ins”  and  “long-term  contracting” 

•	 inﬁnite  spreading  of  distribution

no  invariant  distribution  (Atkeson-Lucas)

→ 

immiseration 

→ 
Nice  result
