Incomplete  Markets  and  Asset  Prices 

This  problem  investigates  the  eﬀects  of  market  incompleteness  on  asset  pricing  following 
Constantinides and Duﬃe  (1996).  There  is a  continuum of  individuals with  identical CRRA 
preferences:  u (c) = c1−γ / (1 − γ )  and  sub jective  discount  factor  is  β . 
(a)  Write  down  the  Euler  equation  for  individual  i  and  asset  j.  This  equation  should

2  Two-Sided Lack of Commitment:  Stationary Alloca­
tions 

Consider  the  environment  of  Alvarez  and  Jermann  (2000),  where  the  economy  is  populated 
by  equal  number  of  two  types  of  agents  with  perfectly  negatively  correlated  endowment, 
both  with  lack  of  committment.  Focus  on  the  two-state  case. 
Based  on  the  result  that  for  the  symmetric  case  with  2  agents  and  2  shocks  the  optimal 
allocation eventually reached a ”memory-less” (history independent) allocation, we now seek 
to  characterize  optimal  stationary  symmetric  distributions.

Moreover,  show  that  ω  is  decreasing  in  β  and  increasing  in  p  . 
(b) We  call  a  stationary  symmetric  allocation  feasible  if  it  satisﬁes  the  resource  and  partici­

(c)  Show  that  full  risk  sharing  is  attainable  if  and  only  if:

(d) Here we  use  the  comparative  static  results  for  ω  found  in  part  (a)  and  the  result  in  part 
(c)  to  examine  the  parameters  that  aﬀect  the  feasibility  of  risk  sharing. 
How  do  β  and  p  aﬀect  the  likelihood  of  full-risk  sharing  being  feasible? 
Show that for small enough spread between y1  and y 2  (holding e constant) full risk sharing 
is  not  possible.  Let  utility  take  the  form  u (c) =  c1−σ / (1 − σ)  show  that  if  σ  is  suﬃciently 
close  to  0  full  risk  is  not  feasible. 
(e) If full risk sharing is not attainable we are interested in the best allocation that is feasible. 
Using your results from part (b) show that if (5) is not satisﬁed the best symmetric allocation

and  y 2  ≤  c2  ≤  c1  ≤  y 1  (i.e.  satisﬁes  the  above  two  equations  and  has  less  variability  than 
autarky). 
(f ) Here we compute numerically the optimal allocation for the case where the utility function 
is  of  the  CRRA  form:  u (c) = c1−σ / (1 − σ). 
Use  the  following  parameters1  β  =  .65, p  = 0.75, y 1  = 0.641  and  y 2  = 0.359.  Plot  the 
optimal c1  and c2  as functions of σ  for the range σ ∈  [1, 5] (i.e.  use a grid over σ with enough 
points  between  1  and  5)  2 .

Investment  with  Fixed  Costs 

Consider  the  following  problem  of  a  ﬁrm  under  uncertainty  in  discrete  time.  At  time  t 
current  proﬁts  net  of  user  costs  of  capital  are  given  by  π (kt , zt )  where  zt  ∈ Z  is  the  current 
shock  to  proﬁts  and  kt  is  the  amount  of  capital  used  during  period  t.  The  function  π (k , z ) 
is  assumed  to  be  strictly  concave  in  k .  Assume  zt  follows  a Markov  process. 
At  the  beginning  of  the  period  the  current  shock  zt  is  realized  and  the  ﬁrm  observes  it. 

1These  parameters  imply  a  standard  deviation  for  log-output  of  .29  and  a  ﬁrst-order  autocorrelation  of 
.5,  matching  ﬁndings  by  Heaton  and  Lucas  (1996)  using  the  PSID. 
2Hint:  Make  sure  you  ﬁrst  check  for  perfect  risk  sharing.  If  full  risk  sharing  is  available  take  that 
allocation.  Otherwise  compute  the  allocation  that  satisﬁes  the  requirements  in  part  (e),  which  may  imply 
autarky  or  some  insurance  (watch  out:  do  not  compute  an  allocation  with  more  variability  than  autarky!).

The  ﬁrm  then  decides  whether  or  not  to  adjust  its  capital  stock. 
If  the  ﬁrm  decides  not  to  adjust  its  capital  then  its  capital  remains  at  the  previous  level 
kt−1  –  we  assume  no  depreciation.  If  instead  the  ﬁrm  chooses  to  adjust  its  capital  then  it 
pays a ﬁxed cost c (zt ) and selects a new capital  level kt .  The costs may depend on the shock 
zt  but  do  not  depend  on  the  new  level  of  capital  kt  chosen. 
The  ﬁrms  ob jective  is  to maximize  expected  discounted  proﬁts  net  of  any  costs  incurred 
for  changing  its  capital  stock.  The  ﬁrm  discounts  proﬁts  using  a  constant  interest  rate  r . 
a.  Argue  that  kt−1 , zt  is  the  relevant  state  variable  for  a  ﬁrm  trying  to  decide whether  or 
not  to  adjust  capital.  Set  up  the  Bellman  equation  for  the  value  of  the  ﬁrm  v (k− , z )  where 
k represents  the  previous  period’s  capital  stock  and  z  represents  the  current  shock. 
− 
b.  Use  your  Bellman  equation  from  (a)  to  argue  that  the  optimal  policy  can  be  summa­
rized  by  a  region  of  inaction K (z )  and  an  optimal  adjustment  policy  k∗  (z ).  For  each  z  ∈ Z 
the  region  of  inaction  K (z )  is  a  subset  of  R+  such  that  adjustment  occurs  in  the  current 
period  if  and  only  if  k−  ∈/ K (z ) .  If  adjustment  occurs  then  the  ﬁrm  chooses  k∗  (z )  as  its 
new  capital  stock.  (note:  you  are not asked  to  actually  solve  for K (z )  or k∗  (z )  just  to  show 
that  the  solution  takes  this  form). 
c.  Is k∗  (z ) equal to the unconstrained optimum level of capital, i.e.  k∗  (z ) = arg maxk  π (k , z )? 
d.  Can  the  region  of  inaction  K (z )  always  be  summarized  by  “sS  rules”,  that  is  that 
for  each  state  of  the  world  the  inaction  region  is  a  single  closed  interval  so  that  there  exists 
�
�
functions  k¯ (z )  and  k (z )  such  that 
k−  : k¯ (z ) ≥ k−  ≥ k (z )
? 

K (z ) = 

Why  or  why  not? 
e.  Show  that  if  the growth  rate of z  is  i.i.d.  (so  that z �/z = ε  i.i.d.)  and π (k , z ) and  c (z ) 
are  homogenous  of  degree  one  (constant  returns  to  scale)  so  that  π (k , z ) =  sπ (k/z , 1)  and 
c (z ) = ¯cs  then  v (k− , z ) , k∗  (z ) , K (z )  are  homogenous  of  degree  one. 
Deﬁne  kˆ =  k /z .  What  do  these  results  imply  about  the  region  of  inaction  Kˆ (z )  and 
−
−
the  optimum  adjustment  kˆ∗  (z )  for  kˆ ?−
f.  Consider  an  industry  with  a  continuum  of  ex-ante  identical  ﬁrms  facing  their  own 
idiosyncratic  z -shocks  that  are  independent  over  time  and  across  ﬁrms.  Suppose  these  ﬁrms 
use sS  rules  for k as described  in part  (d).  Brieﬂy discuss how you would  think of a  steady 
− 
state  in  such  an  economy  –  what  kind  of  ob ject  is  a  possible  equilibruim  and  what  does  it 
have  to  satisfy?  What  determines  the  steady  state  level  of  aggregate  investment?
