Parts (a)  and (b)  are just   a  refresher from the lectures. 
(a)  Assume  that  there  is  no  aggregate  savings  technology,  that  the  state  of  nature  is 
observable  and  that  there  are  no  commitment  problems. 
Write out the Pareto problem for given Pareto weights {λi}i∈I . Show that at the optimum 
consumption for individual  i,  ci
t  (st ) ,  can  be  written  as  depending  only  on  aggregate  income 
in that period  – once we control for  Yt  (st ) consumption  does  not  depend  additionally  on  st  . 
(b) We now generalize the previous result.  Assume there is a  “storage technology”: if in 
period  t  − 1  an  amount  St  (st−1 ) ≥  0  was  put  aside  for  storage,  then  in  period  t  an  amount 
(1 + rt  (st )) St  (st−1 )  is  available  (for  consumption  or  storage)  in  addition  to  any  current 
income  Yt  (st ).  Show that  a  similar result  as in (a) holds but that  now we must condition on 
total  consumption  C (st ) ≡  � i∈I  ci
t  (st ).  (note  that  we  impose  the  non-negativity constraint 
on  storage,  thus  our  result  in  a  can  be  thought  as  a  special  case  where  rt  ≡  0  so  that  at  the 
optimum  St  = 0  and  thus  Ct  =  Yt ). 
(c) Let  the  utility  function  be  of  the  CARA  form 

u i  (c) = 

−1 
γ i  exp  −γ i c 
�

i  =  aiCt  +  bi  where  ai  and  bi  are  constants  and 
show  that  consumption  takes  the  form:  ct
ai  =  1  and 
bi  =  0.  How  does  the  distribution  of  γ i  aﬀect  ai  and  bi?  How  does  the 
�

distribution  of  Pareto  weights  λi  aﬀect  ai  and  bi? 
1  Note  that  st  summarizes  the  entire  distribution  of  current  income  and  possibly  contains  additional 
information,  e.g.  forecasts  of  future  income.

(d) Let  the  utility  function  be  of  the  CRRA  form 

u i  (c) = 

1−σ 

c
1 − σ 

where the risk aversion  σ  is  assumed  to  be  the  same  for  all  individuals.  Show  that  consump­
tion  takes  the  form  ci
t  =  αiCt  with  the  constants  αi  satisfying  � i∈I  αi  = 1.  How  do  the 
constants  αi  depend  on  the  Pareto  weights  λi? 

2  Risk  Sharing Productivity:  Consumption  and  Labor 

Consider  a  social  planner  who  maximizes  the  utility  of  a  continuum  of  agents  of  measure 
one  ex-ante  identical,  with  preferences  over  consumption  and  leisure 

u (c, l) 

where  we  assume  that  utility  function  u (.)  is  strictly  concave,  continuously  diﬀerentiable 
and  increasing  in  both  its  arguments. 
Agents  are  heterogeneous  ex-post  according  to  their  productivity.  They  draw  one  non­
negative productivity parameter  ω  ∈  Ω independently from a known continuous distribution 
function F . We assume that the  support Ω  = [ωmin , ωmax ] is compact and the density function 
density  function  f  (ω) is  bounded  above  and  bounded  away  from  zero. 
The  resource  constraint  in  this  economy  is 

� 

c(ω)f (ω)dω  ≤ 

� 

(1 − l(ω))ωf (ω)dω  +  e 

for  some  endowment  e  ≥  0. 
Let  us assume that agents’ productivity  is ex-post publicly  observable,  so that consump­
tion  and  leisure  can  be  conditioned  on  their  ability,  i.e.  c (ω) and  l (ω). 
(a)  Write  down  the  social  planner  problem,  noting  that,  given  that  the  agents  are  a 
continuum  of  measure  one,  by  the  law  of  large  number,  the  ex-ante  probability  coincides 
with  the  ex-post   distribution. 
(b) Show  that,  under  the  given  assumptions,  leisure  is  a  decreasing  function  of  the  pro­
ductivity parameter  ω . Discuss. 
(c) Show that the dependence of consumption on the productivity parameters depends on 
the  assumption  on  the  sign  of  the  cross-derivative  ucl  (short  notation  for  ∂ 2 u(.) ).  Comment. 
∂ c∂ l 
(d) Show that assuming  that leisure is a normal good is  suﬃcient (for any  sign of  ucl ) to 
have  the  utility  function  decreasing  in  the  productivity.  Discuss  the  role  of  risk  sharing.

(e) Assume now that agents’ productivity is not  ex-post observable anymore.  Given your 
result  in  the  previous  point,  is  the  previous  allocation  implementable?  Comment. 

3  Overlapping  Generations 

In this problem we  study an overlapping generations model  under two market interpretations 
and  isolate  the  conditions  for  Pareto  optimality. 
All  individuals  live  for  only  two  periods.  Generation  t  (denoted  by the  superscript)  has 
utility  function: 

t  +  βu  c t
u c t
� 
�  � 
� 
t+1 
where  u  :  R+  →  R  is  strictly  concave  and  increasing  in  the  single  consumption  good  c. 
Individuals are endowed  with  one unit  of labor in the ﬁrst period  of  their lives and  supply 
it  inelastically.  Capital  is  owned  by  individuals  and  rented  out  to  ﬁrms.  Competitive  ﬁrms 
rent  capital  and  labor  at  prices  rt  and  wt  (in  terms  of  time t  consumption  goods).  At  time 
zero  all initial  capital is held by  the  old (i.e.  generation  t  =  −1). 
The  resource  constraint  is,  

t−1  ≤  F  (kt , 1) + (1 − δ) kt , 
t  +  ct
kt+1  +  ct

where  F  is a constant returns to  scale (CRS)  production function and  δ  ∈  (0, 1]. 
(a)  Sequential  Trade.  Consider  the  sequential  competitive  market  arrangement  where 
individuals in generation  t  face  the  budget  constraints,

(b) Time-0  trade.  Now  consider  the  complete  market  arrangement  where  we  imagine  all 
generations  (the  born  and  yet  unborn)  and  ﬁrms  meeting  at  time  zero  and  competitively 
trading  in  claims for future  consumption, labor  and  capital.  We generalize the  notation  and 
specialize  it  to  interpret  our  overlapping  generations  model.

(Hint:  construct  an  allocation  that  increases  everyone’s  consumption  for  all  periods  t 
high  enough  such  that  at  the  original  equilibrium  allocation  capital  remains  higher  than  the 
golden  rule,  i.e.  ks  > kg  for  s  ≥  t).

generations  such  that  the  equilibrium  allocation  maximizes:
