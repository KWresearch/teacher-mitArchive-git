Let  utility  be  given  by:

u (ct ) 
t=0 
where  u (c) = − 1  exp {−γ c} .  Assume  the  standard  intertemporal  budget  constraint 
γ 
At+1  = (1 + r) (At  + yt  − ct ) . 

(note:  we  do  not  necessarily  impose  β (1 + r) = 1  here).  Assume  that  yt  is  i.i.d.  across  time 
and  agents.  Let  yt  = y¯ + εt  where  εt  is  i.i.d.  and Et−1εt  = 0. We  do  not  impose  a  borrowing 
constraint  on  this  problem, At  can  take  any  value,  although  a  no-Ponzi  condition  should  be 
thought  as being  implicitly  imposed  for  the problem  to be well deﬁned  (you will not have  to

think  about  this  no-Ponzi  condition  explicitly  for  solving  the  problem  though). 
(a)  Show  that  the  consumption  function,

Δct  =

[note  that  the  functional  form  of  the  consumption  function,  as  a  function  of  At  and  current 
and  expected  income,  is  like  the  CEQ-PIH  except  for  the  constant  π (r, γ )] 
(b) Use the Euler equation and your results in (a) to show that the consumption function 
in  (a)  is  optimal  for  some  π  (hint:  use  the Euler  equation  to  guess  and  verify  the  optimality 
of  the  above  consumption  function)  which  depends  on  r  and  the  distribution  of  ε. 
(c)  Show  that  π (r, γ ) > 0  if  r  is  such  that  β (1 + r) = 1.  Compare  this  to  the  CEQ-PIH 
case.  How  does  π  depend  on  the  uncertainty  in  yt? 
(d)  Assume  there  is  a  constant  measure  1  of  individuals  in  the  population.  Argue  that 
for  aggregate  consumption  and  assets  to  be  constant  and  ﬁnite  in  the  long  run  (in  the  limit 
→ ∞) 
as  t 
we  require  that  π (r, γ ) = 0.  What  does  this  imply  about  average  long-run 
asset  holdings  as  a  function  of  r  and  γ (denote  this  by  A (r, γ ))?  What  is  happening  to  the 
cross-section  of  consumption?  Does  this  distribution  converge? 
(e) Use your results in (d) to compute the equilibrium interest rate re  as a function of γ  for 
β  =  .97,  ¯y  = 1.  Assume  ε  distributed  normal  with  mean  zero  and  standard  deviation  equal

to σ  (this distributional assumption allows you to ﬁnd an explicit expression for E exp (−ε)). 
Compute  re  for  two  cases  σ  =  0.2  and  0.4  ,  ﬁxing  γ  =1.  Compare  this  to  the  interest  rate 
that  prevails  without  uncertainty. 
(f )  Brieﬂy  discuss  how  you  would  think  of  calibrating  γ  if  you  really  believed  that  pref­
erences  are CRRA  c1−σ / (1 − σ)  for  some  known  value  of  σ ,  but  you want  to work with  this 
model  as  an  approximation  (because  of  its  analytical  tractability). 
Speculate  on  whether  this  is  likely  to  be  a  good  approximation  for  learning  about  re . 
Can  this  be  a  good  approximation  for  learning  about  the  long-run  (invariant)  distribution 
of  asset  holdings?

Income Fluctuation Problem – Numerical Computa­
tion

This exercise asks you to compute numerically an income ﬂuctuations problem.  The problem 
is 
∞
1−σ 
ct 
β t 
1 − σ 
t=0	
xt+1  = (1 + r) (xt  − ct ) + yt+1 
where  xt  represents  “cash  in  hand”  and  yt  labor  income.  Consider  the  following  two  alter­
native  income  processes: 

sub ject  to: 

max E0 

Process  I  yt  is  assumed  to  be  i.i.d.  with  only  two  possible  realizations  yl  = 1.7w  and 
yh  =  .5w  with  1/2  probability  each. 
� 
�
Process  II  yt  follows  a  two-state Markov  process  with  transition matrix 

Π = 

πHH  πH L 
πLH	 πLL 

where  again  yl  = 1.7w  and  yh  =  .5w  and  πHH  =  .9  and  πLL  =  .5. 

Set  β  =  .97,  r = 2%  and  w = 1. 
You are given the basic matlab codes that should allow you to understand how to compute 
the  solution  to  the  income  ﬂuctuation  problem.  In  fact  you  are  given  two  codes,  one  that 
uses  the  simple  grid  method  (explained  in  SL  ch.4)  and  the  other  which  uses  splines  which 
sometimes  is  more  eﬃcient,  but  you  are  not  required  to  look  at  it.  You  are  supposed  to 
modify  the  simple  code  in  order  to match  the  new  parameters  and  the  two  diﬀerent  income 
processes.  You  are  required  to  hand  in  your  code. 
Perform  all  calculations  below  for  both  the  alternative  income  processes  and

Notice  that  in  the  i.i.d. we  could  have  simpliﬁed  the  problem  by  reducing  the  state  at  cash-
in-hand  only,  but  since we  are working  also with  a permanent process  for  income, we need  a 
two  dimensional  state  vector  anyway. 
(a)  Solve  the  optimal  consumption  problem  obtaining  the  consumption  function  c (x) . 
Plot  the  function  for consumption, asset holdings a�  (z ) = z − c (z ) , and cash-in-hand  for  to­
morrow (for both realizations of tomorrow’s income shock), that is, z �  (a, y � ) = (1 + r) a�  (z )+ 
y �  for  both  possible  values  of  y � .  How  do  your  results  diﬀer  between  the  two  alternative  in­
come  processes? 
(b)  Use  this  policy  function  together  with  random  shocks  to  simulate  the  evolution  of 
cash-in-hand,  income,  consumption  and  assets  for  200  periods.  Plot  the  simulated  series  for 
consumption, income and assets.  Is consumption smoother than income?  How high are asset 
holdings?  For  what  fraction  of  periods  is  the  agent  liquidity  constrained  (i.e.  xt  − ct  =  0)? 
How  do  your  results  depend  on  σ?  Compare  the  two  alternative  income  processes 
(c)  Compute  a  longer  simulation  (around  11001  periods),  throw  away  the  ﬁrst  1001

periods  (that  is,  from  t  =  0  to  t  =  1000  included)  and  calculate  the  average  asset  holdings 
with  the  remaining  periods.  That  is,  based  on  the  simulated  sequence  for  {zt} 11000  compute

(d)  (Carroll,  1997) Modify  the  income  process  to  have  the  following  characteristic:  there 
is  a  small  probability  π  of  income  being  zero.  If  this  event  does  not  occur  income  is  drawn 
from  the  same  distribution  as  before. 
Argue  that,  with  the  preferences  above,  the  borrowing  constraint  will  never  bind:  we 
always  have  at  = xt  − ct  > 0  (you  do  not  have  to  compute.  If  we  allow  for  some  borrowing, 
so  that  we  replace  the  constraint  at  ≥  0  with  at  ≡  xt  − ct  ≥ −b  for  some  positive  b >  0, 
argue  that  this  condition  will  never  bind  and  that  in  fact  at  > 0. 
(e)  Now  you  will  compute  the  equilibrium  for  this  model  as  in  Aiyagari  (1994).  Using 
the  Cobb-Douglas  technology  F  (K, L) = K αL1−α  solve  the  following  system  for  K (r)  and 
w (r): 

r  =  Fk  (K, 1) − δ 
w  =  FL  (K, 1) 

(1) 

Here  K (r)  and  w (r)  represent  the  level  of  capital  demanded  by  ﬁrms  and  the  associated 
wage  if  the  interest  rate  at  a  steady  state were  equal  to  r  and  labor  supply  and  demand  are 
equal. 
For  any  proposed  value  of  r  (equivalently  one  can  propose  a  value  for K  and  obtain  the 
implied  proposed  r  using  (1)) we  can  use  the  implied  value  for  the wage w (r)  and  solve  the 
individual’s income ﬂuctuations problem given r and w (r).  Then using the method in (c) we 
can calculate the average asset holdings, denote this by A (r).  Think of A (r) as representing 
the  steady  state  supply  of  capital  by  individuals  when  the  interest  rate  equals  to  r  and  the 
wage  is  w (r). 
We are  looking  for a value  for r  such that K (r) = A (r),  i.e.  that the quantity demanded 
and supplied of capital at a steady state are equal.  Using α =  .33, δ = 8% and the parameters 
given  above  plot  A (r)  against  K (r)  by  computing  A (r)  for  several  values  of  r  (pick  values 
in  the  interval  0 ≤ r < 1/β − 1).  Find  the  value  of  r  and K  at  which  both  curves  intersect.
