Intertemporal  Elasticity  of  Substitution,  Risk  Aver­
sion  and  the  Cost  of  Fluctuations 

This  problem  will  familiarize  you  with  the  non-expected  utility  framework  of  Kreps  and 
Porteus  (1978),  Epstein  and  Zin  (1991)  and Weil  (1990). 
Let  remaining  lifetime  utility  after  the  resolution  of  current  consumption  at  time  t  be

given  by  vt .  Assume  vt  satisﬁes:

for 1 ≥ ρ = 0 and 
α ≤ 1. Think of this equation as deﬁning a stochastic process for {vt} given 
a  stochastic  process  for  {ct}.  In  any  period  t  before  the  resolution  of  current  consumption 
we  can  deﬁne  lifetime  utility  by  ut  as:

(a)  Show  that  if  {vt}  is  implied  by  {ct}  using  (1)  then  {λvt}  is  implied  by  {λct}  using  (1) 
for any λ > 0.  Show that if ct  = ψ  for some constant ψ  then vt  and ut  are also constant 
and  equal  to  ψ . 1 
(b)  For  any  stationary  process  c = {ct} , with  associated  utility  u0 ,  let  ¯c  denote  the  deter­
· · · 
ministic  and  constant  sequence  of  consumption  (E ct , E ct , 
).  Deﬁne  our  measure  of 
welfare  loss  from  the  variability  of  {ct}  to  be  that  constant  percentage  increase,  η ,  in 
the  process  c  that  is  required  to make  the  individual  indiﬀerent  between  (1 + η) c  and 
c¯. 
Use  your  results  in  (a)  to  show  that:

from  t  on,  after  (before)  the  resolution  of  time  t  consumption.

(i)  Show  that  if  {ct}  is  deterministic  then  (3)  holds  (without  the  need  for  the  ex­
pectation  operator  of  course).  Use  this  to  compute  the  value  of  utility  ob­
tained  if  clh  = (cl , ch , cl , ch , ...),  denote  this  lifetime  utility  by  v0,l .  and  v0,h , 
chl  = (ch , cl , ch , cl , ...) . How does your answer depend on  the parameters α  and ρ? 
→ 
(ii)  It  is  useful  to  think  of  the  limit  as  β 
1.  Show  that  v0,h  and  v0,l  converge  to  the 
same value.  What is the intuition for this?  Compute the welfare loss as a fraction 
of  the  constant  consumption  stream  that  equals  the  average  ¯c ≡  1
2 ch  +  1
2 cl .  How 
does  your  answer  depend  on  the  parameters  α  and  ρ? 
(iii)  Compute  the  value  of  u0  if  the  sequences  clh  and  chl  occur  with  probability  1/2 
→
(which  is  revealed  at  the  beginning  of  period  0)  as  β 
1.  This  should  be  very 
easy  given  your  answer  to  (ii).  How  does  your  answer  depend  on  the  parameters 
α  and  ρ? 

→
1  here,  we  are  back  to  β  bounded  away 
(e)  (note:  we  no  longer  work  with  the  limit  β 
from  1)  Find  an  expression  for  utility,  u0 ,  when  {ct}  is  such  that  c  = (ch , ch , ...)  with 
probability 1/2  and  c = (cl , cl , ...) with probability 1/2.  How does your answer depend 
on  the  parameters  α,  ρ? 

(f )  Let	 ct  be  i.i.d.  distributed  over  time  with  outcomes  cl  and  ch  each  with  probability 
1/2.  Combine  (1)  and  (2)  and  the  fact  that  with  i.i.d.  consumption  ut  =  u0  to  show

that  u0  must  solve  of  the  form:

Think  of  this  equation  as  implicitly  deﬁning  u0  (whether  it  does  so  uniquely  is  an 
interesting  question  I  am  not  asking).  Why  does  this  equation  involve  both  of  the 
parameters  α  and  ρ? 

(g)  Use  the  equation  (4)  found  in  part  (f )  to  compute  u0  and  then  the  welfare  loss,  η ,  as 
deﬁned  in  (b)  of  consuming  the  i.i.d.  sequence  described  in  (f ). 
Set  the  rest  of  the  parameters  in  all  cases  as  follows:  β  =  .95  and  log ch  = 1.02  and 
log cl  = 0.98.  Using  a  computer  ﬁnd  the  welfare  loss  for  all  nine  combinations  of  the 
parameters:  α = 1,  1/2, −1  and  ρ = 1,  1/2, −1.  Display  your  results  for  η  on  a  table. 
Hint.  To  solve  you  can  iterate  on  this  equation:  plug  in  a  good  initial  guess  (such 
as  u0  =  1)  on  the  right  hand  side  and  compute  the  LHS,  then  use  this  new  number 
on  the  right  hand  side.  Repeat  this  process  until  the  numbers  converge  (when  there 
absolute  value  diﬀerence  is  less  than  10−10  say).  You  can  work  with  any  program  for 
this:  Matlab  or  Excel  will  certainly  do.
