1  Shorter  Questions  (40 miliutes) 

1.  True or  False?  Justify  your  answer.  Consider  a consumer  with  uncertain 
fu ture   income that  can save a t  a constant  interest  ra te  T  and  has  a  concave 
utility  function u ( c )  satisfying  u"'  ( c )  > 0.  Suppose the  individual  experi- 
ences  a n  unexpected  windfalI  increase  in  assets.  Then  due  t o  precautionary 
savings th is   consumer  would  save a higher fraction  of  this windfall  than  the  
CEQ-PIH ~ ~ . l ~ u l d  
predict. 

2.  True  or  False?  Justify  your  answer.  Consider  sunning  the  cross  sec- 

tional regression: 

logg' = a o i c u l l o g ( l + r Z )  +ui 
where g i  is gross consumption growth and ri is  the  net  interest ra te  between 
two  dates  for  individual  i.  Assume  net  interest  ra tes   differ  permanently 
across  individuals or groups because of  exogenous t a x  differences.  The  hope 
is  t h a t   a l  identifies  the   elasticity  of  substitution  preference  parameter,  o. 
However,  a n   income  fluctuations model  as  in   Aiyagari  (1994)  implies  t h a t  
th i s  regression,  a t  a  steady  s ta te ,  should yield  a1 = 0,  independently of  the  
value 0 .  Thus ,  in  this  sense, estimating  this equation  does  not  identify o. 

3 .   Consider  a  representative  agent endowment economy with  preferences 
E C:"=,'u 
( c t )  with a stochastic endowment process { y t } .  At  time t the  only 
information available is  the  history  of  income shocks. 
(a )  Find a formula for the  gross short term  interest ra te  process Rt  = l + r t  
in  terms  of  t h e   { y t }  process.  In  general, is  F&  constant? 

(b)  Assuming preferences are  CRRA u (c) = el-"/  (1 - o)  find conditions 
on  the   { y , }   process  t h a t   ensure t h a t   & is constant. 

(c)  Suppose we  a t temp ted   t o   test  t h e  Euler  equation  prediction  for  th is  
econoiny bu t   assumed  in our  calculations  a  constant  real  interest  rate.  Tha t  
is, we  tes t   whether  or not: 

holds  for  some R .   Should we  expect  to  accept  or  reject  th is  equation? 

4.  Suppose preferellees are given  by, 

with  y < 1, and where  ht  is  the  stock of  habits  accumulated  up   t o  time  t ,  

1-6  6 
ht  = ht-1  ct-1 

(no te   t h a t   if  consumption  is  constant  then  eventuaily  & converges  t o   this 
constant  value).  Show t h a t   these preferences  are cquivalent t o  

a s  long  as P ,  y are  low  enough or  6 is  high  enough.

Investment  w i th  Fixed  Costs  (40 minutes) 

Consider  the  following problem  of  a firm under  uncertainty  in discrete  time. 
At  time  t  current  profits  net  of  user  costs  of  capital  are   given  by  .rr  ( k t ,  z,) 
where  zt  E  Z is  the   current  shock to  profits  and  kt  is  the  amount  of  capital 
used  during period  t .  The function  .rr  ( k ,  z )  is  assumed  t o  be strictly concave 
in k.  Assume zt  follows  a Mziskov  process. 
At  t h e  beginning  of  the   period  the   current  shock  zt  is  realized  and  tlie 
firm  observes i t .   T h e  firm  then   decides whether  or  not  to  adjust  i ts  capital 
stock. 
If  t h e  firm decides not  t o  adjust i ts  capital then  its  c a p ~ t a l  remains a t  the  
previous  level  kt-l  - we  assume no  depreciation.  If  instead  the   firm chooses 
t o  adjust  i ts  c a p ~ t a l  then  i t  pays  a  fixed  cost  c ( z t )  and selects  a  new  capital 
level  k t .   T h e  costs  may  depend  on  the   shock  zt  bu t   d o   n o t   depend  on  the  
new  level of  capital  kt  chosen. 
T h e  firms objective is  t o  maximize expected discounted profits net  of  any 
costs incurred for  changing i ts  capital stock.  The  firm discounts profits using 
a  constant  interest  rate  r .  
a.  Argue  t h a t   k t - l ,   st  is  the   relevant  s ta te   variable  for  a  firm  trying  to 
decide whether  or  not  t o  adjust  capital.  Set up  t h e  Beliman equation for the  

value  of  the   firm  v (k-.  z )  where k-  represents  the  previous period's  capital 
s tock land  z  represents  the  current  shock. 
b.  Use your  Bellman  equation  from  (a)  t o  argue  tha t   the  optimal  policy 
can be summarized by  a region  of  inaction  K (z)  and an optimal  adjustment 
policy  k* (z ) .   For  each  z  E  Z  the   region  of  inaction  K (z )  is  a  subset  of  R+ 
such  t h a t   adjustment occurs in  the  current period  if  and only if  k-  $ K (z )  . 
If  adjustment  occurs  then  the   h m  chooses  k"  (z)   a s   i ts   new  capital  stock. 
(note:  you  are  no t   asked  t o   actually  solve  for  K (z )  or  k* (z )  just  t o   show 
t h a t   t h e  solution  takes  this  form). 
c.  Is  k* (z)   equal  t o   the   unconstrained  optimum  level  of  capital,  i.e. 
k* (z )  = arg ma- 
r (k ,  z ) ?  
d .   Can the  region of  inaction I<  (z)  always be summarized by  " s S  rules", 
t h a t   is  t h a t   for  each  s ta te  of  t h e  world  t h e  inaction  region  is  a  single closed 
interval  so t h a t   there  exists functions  x (z)  and 
(z )  such  t h a t  
K (z)  = {k-  : x (z)  2 k-  > & ( z ) ) ?  

Why  or  why  no t?  
e.  Show  tha t   if  the  growth  ra te   of  z  is  i.i.d.  (so t h a t   z l /z   = E  i.i.d.)  and 
n (k ,  z )  and  c (2)  a re  homogenous  of  degree  one  (constant  re turns   t o   scale) 
so t h a t   .rr  (k ,  z )  = s.rr ( k l z ,  1) and  c ( z )  = b then  v (k-, z )  , k"  (z )  , K (z )  are  
homogenous of  degree one. 
Define  k-  = k - lz .   Wha t   do  these results  imply  abou t  the  region of  inac- 
tion  K (z )  and  the  optimum  adjustment  k (z)  for  k-? 
f .   Consider an  industry with  a continuum of  ex-ante identical firms facing 
their  own  idiosyncratic  z-shocks  t h a t   are   independent  over  time  and  across 
firms.  Suppose these firms use sS  rules for k-  as descnbed in par t   ( d ) .  Briefly 
discuss  how  you  would  think  of  a  steady  s ta te   in  such  an  economy - what 
kind  of  object  is  a  possible  equilibruim  and  what  does  it  have  to  satisfy? 
W h a t   determines t h e  steady s ta te  level  of  aggregate investment? 

3  T h e  American Dream   (40 minutes)  
A  consumer has  preferences: 

where  u (c)  is  an  increasing  concave differentiable utility  function  over  non- 
durable  consumption  c.  Here  T  represents  the   moment  the   agent  buys  a 
house  - a n  indivisable  durable  good which  yields  a  stock  utility  V  from  i t s  
ownership. We  allow  "T = oo" and   interpret  this as never  buying  a  house. 
The   value  of  a  house  is  constant  over  time  and   equal  t o   H  >  0.  T h e  
consumer  receives a  constant labor  income flow y, owns  initial assets a.  and  
faces  a  constant  interest  ra te  r = p.  We  assume  initially  tha t   the  consumer 
can borrow  and lend  freely a t   th is   interest  ra te .  
(a)  Derive the  present value budget  constraint  t h a t  the  consumption pa th ,  
c ( t )  , and  the   time  of  t h e  house purchase, T, must  satisfy. 
(b) Using  the   change  in  variables x  = e P T  so  t h a t   x  E  [ O , l ]   set  up  t h e  
Lagrangian  for  the  consumer's  problem over  s and  c ( t ) .  Characterize  fully 
the   optimal  x  E [ O , l ]   and   pa th   c ( t )  a s  a  function  of  t h e  parameters  y  a n d  
an. " 

(c) W-e  now  impose  the   following borrowing  constraint:  if  the   consumer 
buys  a  house  a t   time  T  then  his  accumulated  wealth  a t   time  T  must  be 
greater  or equal t o  H. Write this constraint  as an inequality involving T and  
c ( t )  for  t  < T  only  ( a s   well  as the   parameters  r, y  and  H).  Rewrite  th i s  
constraint  in  terms  of  x  and  c ( t )  for  t  5 T. 
(d)   Using  t h e   change  in  variable  s =  e-rT  se t   u p   the   the   consumer's 
problem  as maximizing utility  subject  t o  the  present  value  constraint  found 
in   (a)  and  the  borrowing constraint  derived  in  (c). 
Set  up  the   associated  Lagrangian  and  derive  the   necessary  first  order 
conditions  for x E  [ O , l ]   and  for  an  interior  c ( t ) .  For  0 < x  < 1 be  careful t o  
consider separately  the   f.0.c.  for  c ( t )  for  ( i )   t  < T  (before buying  a  house); 
(ii)  t 2 T  (after buying  the  house). 
(e) Show t h a t   there  is  always  a solution  to the  first  order  condtions with 
x  = 0  and  t h a t   there  may  be  another  solution  with  x  > 0.  Characterize 
these pa ths   as much  as  possible.  Show  tha t   solutions  with  x t 0 involve a 
discontinuity  in  consumption  a t  T. Why? 
( f )  We now compare the  two possible solutions to t h e  first order conditions 
found  in   (a) .   For  some  given  y ,   le t   V (ao) and  W (ao)  denote  the   lifetime 
utility  a t ta ined   as  a  function  of  a0  of  using  the   x  = 0  plan  and  the   x  > 0 
plan  (if  one exists given  a.  and y ) ,  respectively. 
Characterize V (ao)  and W (ao)  and show t h a t   there  exists  a  cutoff  level 
of  initial  assets  a;  such  tha t   V  (ao) 5 W (ao )  if  and  only  if  a.  1 a;.  Thus, 
the   consumer  buys  a  house  eventually  if  a.  2 a;  and   never  buys  a  house  if 
a0 < a:  (note:  aF,  depends on y  and  may he  zero). 

4  Hand-to-Mouth Workers  and  Growth 
(40 minutes) 

Consider  the   following  variation  of  the   s tandard  neoclassical growth  model. 
Half  of  the  population,  the   'hand-to-mouth'  consumers (type I ) ,  simply con- 
sume  any  labor  income  they  earn  each  period  - they  never  own  any  assets 
whatsoever.  The  other half, the  'savers' (type 2) ,  have preferences and choices 
a s  in the  s tandard  neoclassical model.  There is no populatioil  growth and we 
conveniently normalize  the   total  population  t o  be  ( a  continuum) of  size 2. 
The  preferences for  the  savers are standard: 

for  some  p  <  1, and  u   twice  continuously  differentiable,  increasing  and 
strictly  concave with  the   INADA  condition  lirn,,o  u'  (c) = oo. 
Technology  is  given  by  the   production  function  Y, = K;L:-*. 
Labor, 
L t ,  is  supplied  inelastically  by  both  types  of  agents  with  to ta l   labor  supply 
normalized  t o   1 - the  savers and  the  hand-to-mouth  agents each  supply  112 
un i t .   The  resource constraint  is, 

where  Ct = c t   + cf  is  aggregate  consumption  and  c1  and   cZ  represents  con- 
sumption of  hand  t o  mouth  consumers savers, respectively. 
(a)   Set  up  the   standasd  description  of  markets  for  labor  and  capital, 
stat,ing the  budget  constraints faced by  savers and hand t o  mouth consumers, 
t h e   (static) problem  of  the  firm.  Define a  competitive  equilibrium. 
(b)   Show  t h a t   in  equilibrium  the   labor  income  and  consumption  of  the  
hand-to-mouth  agents  is  a  constant  fraction X  of  ou tpu t   Y,. Determine  A. 
(c) Argue t h a t   the  competitive  equilibrium is not  optimal for  the   'savers' 
in   t h e   following  sense.  I t   does  no t   maximize  (1) subject  to ,   < + Kt+l  = 
(1 - A )   K f + ( 1  - 6) Kt. Here X  is the  constant fraction of  ou tpu t  t h a t  goes t o  
t h e  hand-to-mouth  agents found in  (b) .   [Hint: compare what the  competitive 
equilbrium  and  the  above optimization  imply for u'  (c:) 
/ p u t  (c:+,)] 
( d )  How  does  the  steady s ta te  level of  capital with  hand-to-mouth  work- 
ers   compare with  the  steady  s ta te   level  in  the   standasd  neoclassical growth 
model? 

(e) Consider the  case with u (c )  = log (c) and 6 = 1. Guess and  verify tha t  
a t  the  equilibrium Kt-l  = sK,". Determines.  [Hint: substitute this guess into 
the  relevant  Euler equation and solve for s].  How does the  introduction of  the  
hand-to-mouth  consumers  affect  the  equilibrium  dynamics  of  consumption, 
ou tpu t   and   capital in  th is   case?
