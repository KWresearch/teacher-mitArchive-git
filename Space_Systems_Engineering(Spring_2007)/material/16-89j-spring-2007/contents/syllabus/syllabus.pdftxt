   1.0 GENERAL DESCRIPTION – SPACE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING: 16.89

Note: The following paragraphs are a general description of the 16.89 Space Systems

engineering course.  Individual projects for 16.89 vary from year to year,  and not all the

descriptions are completely applicable every year.  However,  the generic requirements

are included here to allow students to appreciate the general context of 16.89 projects. 

Systems Engineering and Architecture (SE&A) tells a story.  It is a careful marriage of

fact and vision.  The story must be self-consistent and factual.  At the same time,  the

result must be visionary either in the way in which it meets the customer needs, advances

scientific knowledge,  exploits new technology and processes,  or reaps return for

investors.  Good analysis guarantees success but vision sells the concept. 

Systems Engineering and Systems Architecting have different definitions for different

people.  However,  each definition contains some common elements.  One definition is

“the ensemble of coordinated analyses,  simulations, and processes which lead to the

design of a technical product which best meets the needs of an identified customer.” It is

essential that any systems design tell the “whole” story.  The whole story consists of why, 

which, what, how, when and where. 

• Why: The functional requirements define the customer’s needs and why the mission

is worth conducting. 

Note: Some requirements might be known at the start,  but others might evolve over

time. 

• Which: The trades analysis compares different mission architectures and determines

which architecture best meets the requirements and therefore the customer’s needs. 

• What: The design describes what will actually be built and operated to conduct the

mission. 

• How: The program plan describes the organizational structure,  resource allocation, 

funding profile,  and schedule. 

In essence,  it describes how the mission will be

deployed.

• When: As part of the program plan,  the schedule describes when different mission

development and deployment stages will occur and how they depend upon each other. 

• Where: Also as part of the program plan,  the hardware flow details where the

following are located: component procurement sources,  sub-system integration

facilities, test and validation sequence as well as checkout and launch facilities. 

2.0 ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE

Space Systems Engineering (16.89) is a twelve (12) unit course consisting of four

(4) hours of lectures,  (2) two hours of “laboratory” (team meetings) and six (6) hours of

homework and personal preparation per week.  (Note that for this course,  there is not

necessarily a hard distinction between laboratory and homework.) Lectures and some of

the laboratory work will take place Wednesdays and Fridays from 9:00 a.m.  to 11:00

a.m.,  although a few lectures might occur on other days depending on

external guest speaker availability.  Other laboratory work will be conducted during

standard academic hours to be scheduled amongst the students in their respective teams.   

3.0 SCHEDULE AND WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE

Good scheduling is key to getting the work done in the time allotted.  Formal

reviews provide not only an opportunity to present progress on the program but also

provides intermediate milestones for making sure that the SE&A story makes sense and

that

the various parts of that story fit together. 

If problems are revealed,  careful

Massachusetts Institute of Technology

7

Dept of Aeronautics and Astronautics, ESD

scheduling (planning) allows the team to understand how the remaining time can be most

effectively used to finish the work,  while correcting the problems.  The course schedule

will be posted separately and may change as needed by the various demands that will be

placed on the program.  However,  the final step in the program,  the Critical Design

Review (CDR), can not be delayed. 

3.1 Program Schedule

Traditional program planning consists of three formal presentations (milestones):

the System Requirements Review (SRR); the Preliminary Design Review (PDR); and the

Critical Design Review (CDR).  The work toward these milestones is broken into three

phases: the Conceptual Design Phase; the Preliminary Design Phase; and the Detailed

Design Phase.  The documents that support these milestones may exist in hardcopy but

must also exist in electronic form accessible to the entire class and controlled when

appropriate.  These documents and the associated presentations are described in more

detail in Section 6.0.  

The following description of the traditional design phases is included here for context, as

described at the beginning of Section 1.0.  Some but not all of these elements will be

included in the Spring 2007 project. 

The objective of the Conceptual Design Phase is to arrive at one or two mission

architectures which meet the needs of the customer in a significantly more effective

fashion than other candidate architectures.  To this end,  several tasks must be completed

which are described below.  The relevant document is shown in parentheses:

1. Extract Customer Requirements: The mission is being designed for a customer.  It is

essential that the team understand the needs of that customer.  These needs must be

translated into customer requirements which guide the development of the program.  

These requirements are stated in the language of the customer.  The design should be

periodically compared back to these requirements during the program.  [SRR]

Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Dept of Aeronautics and Astronautics, ESD

2. Functional Requirements: The functional requirements are created from the customer

requirements and mission timelining.  The functional requirements explain what must

be achieved by the mission design but not how it should be done.  The functional

requirements are stated in engineering terms.  [SRR]

3. Architectural Options: All plausible technical options for implementing the various

elements of the mission will be listed.  The open literature,  space mission databases, 

textbooks,  Internet,  Engineering Advisors as well as other sources should be used to

identify these options.  Then,  those element options which are compatible with other

element options are combined into a systems architecture.  If an architecture meets the

customer and functional requirements, it is considered a candidate architecture for the

mission.  [Design Document]

4. Metric Definition: Only a formal and quantifiable method for measuring the ability of

each candidate architecture to meet or exceed the requirements allows a fair

downselection to the architecture to be further developed in subsequent design phases.  

These metrics should include performance and cost but can also include time, 

reliability, etc.  [Design Document]

5. Trade Analysis: Given the metrics, each candidate architecture needs to be studied in

some detail in order to quantify how each ranks with respect to the defined metrics.  

This study requires understanding of some of the functional dependencies between

performance and cost and consumed resources such as mass,  power,  time,  etc.  

[Design Document]

6. Downselection: A formal downselection must lead to one or two architectures which

merit further study.  If a second architecture is carried forward,  it should only be

retained if it provides an alternative to some very high-risk element in the first

architecture,  if it represents a descoping,  or if it is deemed comparable to the first

architecture.  [Design Document]

It is important to realize that decisions made during the Conceptual Design Phase, a phase

which always consists of the least amount of funding,  commits most of the funding that

will be spent in subsequent phases.  If a decision proves to be poor,  it is difficult and

Massachusetts Institute of Technology

9

Dept of Aeronautics and Astronautics, ESD

expensive to change in the subsequent design phases.  In other words,  “Roughly 10% of

the resources are used to determine how to commit the remaining 90%.”

The objective of the Preliminary Design Phase is to take a “straw man” mission

architectural concept and develop the design in more detail.  Functional requirements are

flowed down to technical system and sub-system requirements.  The design explains how

the system achieves its requirements and how the sub-system functions are allocated. The

tasks to be completed are listed below:

1. Respond to SRR Action Items: A formal presentation such as the SRR allows outside

experts to review the design and suggest alternatives,  corrections,  and solutions.  

These comments are collected at the end of the review,  ranked by priority,  and

assigned to a representative of the team as “action items.” Action items are

completed as soon as possible and formally closed at a team meeting. 

[Design

Document]

2. Requirements Flowdown: The customer and functional requirements are flowed

down to the sub-system level.  At this level,  they are stated in technical terms and

start to describe how the mission will work at the system and sub-system levels.  

[SRR]

3.

Interface Refinement: After the SRR,  the organization of the teams might change, 

and groups of people will form more clearly defined groups around individual

disciplines such as environmental control and life support, power, propulsion, etc.  A

formal definition of the new organizational structure as well as definitions of each

group’s interfaces is needed.  These interfaces define what each group needs to know

in order to do their analysis as well as define the type and format of information that

that group will provide to others. 

4. Module Development: With the team broken down into sub-system disciplinary

groups,  software modules (probably written in MATLAB code) which relate sub-

system performance and cost to sub-system requirements will need to be developed.  

For example,  the power group will need to relate cost,  mass,  volume,  lifetime,  and

Massachusetts Institute of Technology

10

Dept of Aeronautics and Astronautics, ESD

heat load of the power system to inputs such as peak power,  average power,  watt-

hours, duty cycle, etc.  [Appendices to Design Document]

5. Module Analyses: With sub-system modules in place,  sub-system trades are

conducted.  For example,  the impact of variations in power consumption,  hardware

mass, number of units, etc. on system cost, performance, reliability, etc.  is calculated.  

This is a highly interactive process and works best if conducted concurrently among

the team members.  These software modules will enable integrated concurrent

engineering sessions. 

6. Budget Development: The systems group will develop budget tracking methods to

monitor

the inevitable growth in resource consumption during the semester.  

Resources such as mass,  power,  computation,  reliability,  volume and cost will be

tracked.  The systems group will hold margins (30% at PDR and 20% at CDR).  The

systems group will also re-allocate margins between groups in order to balance the

difficulty of the design effort.  [Design Document]

7. Detailed Timelining: The details of the chronology of events also impact the design

and warrant further analysis.  [Design Document]

8. PDR  Preparation: Preparing for the review is not simply “viewgraph engineering.”

It forces the SE&A story to be coherent and correct.  Do not under-estimate the effort

associated with this task. 

The Preliminary Design Phase is where teamwork is defined.  Most design failures can be

traced back to poor teamwork.  One of the hardest parts of systems engineering is the

management of interfaces.  There will be times when your work requires input from

others in the class.  Oftentimes,  this input may not be forthcoming for a variety of

reasons.  Sometimes,  it is in the best interest of the project to make assumptions, proceed

with your analysis, and present your results to those with whom you need to interface.  If

you’ve performed the analysis correctly,  changing the value of an input should not take

too long.  “Don’t demand or accuse, help!”

The objective of the Detailed Design Phase is to develop the design such that once the

final design review is successfully completed, the program is ready to “cut metal.” This is

Massachusetts Institute of Technology

11

Dept of Aeronautics and Astronautics, ESD

actually the definition of a traditional “Critical Design Review” (CDR),  but this course

will not go to this level of detail.  However,  detailed block designs of the sub-systems

will be required.  These must be sufficiently detailed such that they can be simulated to

verify that they meet their requirements.  Most of the tasks started during the Preliminary

Design Phase are continued in more detail during the Detailed Design Phase.  The

Program Plan details the organization,  workforce,  schedule,  spending profile and other

programmatic issues associated with the implementation of the mission beyond CDR.  

“The Design Document explains what you are going to do while the Program Plan

explains how you are going to do it.” The Detailed Design Phase is where underestimates, 

design errors, and bad interfaces are revealed.  Efficiency in the design as well as in how

the team works together is critical. 

3.2 Lecture and Laboratory Schedule

A draft schedule for the course is provided on the Stellar web site as a separate document.  

This schedule will be updated as the semester progresses.  Unscheduled periods will be

used for design work.  Periodically,  outside visitors may make presentations to the class, 

followed by an interactive time for questions and answers.  Some class periods have no

lectures planned.  These provide scheduled times when the faculty and staff will be

available to assist in the effort.

5.0 MODULE DEVELOPMENT

Note: Traditional Space Systems Design projects are usually oriented towards hardware

design,  in which case the module development described below typically concentrates on

modeling subsystems.  The Spring 2007 design project will undertake this kind of

computer modeling exercise only in the second part of

the semester,  once the

requirements and architectural tradeoffs are complete.  The following is a description of

the traditional, subsystems-oriented module development. 

During the semester, each student will be responsible for developing and utilizing

a software module.  This module describes the particular discipline for which that student

is responsible and mathematically captures the relationships between that discipline’s

inputs and outputs.  There will be times during the semester when one person will ask

another how much that second person’s sub-system will change (outputs) in the event that

the requirements on that sub-system change (inputs).  For example,  a power subsystem

module might describe how the mass, volume, and reliability change if the required watt-

13

Dept of Aeronautics and Astronautics, ESD

hours, battery (dis)charge duty cycle, and mission lifetime change.  As another example, a

systems module might describe how the total cost of the spacecraft changes as required

power, mass, mission lifetime, and reliability change.  These relationships can be derived

from SMAD as well as other reference material. 

These modules serve several purposes and may be combined with other modules

within that person’s group.  First,  they force the student to understand and codify

functional relationships within their discipline.  Second,  they help to define and clarify

interfaces between the different groups and modules.  These modules will be codified, 

grouped with other modules within that group, documented, utilized, and submitted to the

Design Document as an appendix. 

If codified in Matlab,  they can be linked as function calls (subroutines) with their

strict definitions of inputs and outputs.  During an integrated concurrent engineering

exercise,  the computer display of key assumptions and system budgets will be projected

onto a screen in front of the class.  The class will then alter assumptions and view the

impact of these changes in realtime on the screen.  In this way,  design spaces can be

explored and compared in fractions of the time conventionally required.  Students will be

graded on their modules.  Remember, the module must be complex enough to capture the

important relationships yet simple enough to provide outputs that make sense and code

which is available in time to be used in these integrated concurrent engineering exercises.  

The modules are only useful if their information is correct and they are available on time.  

The following deliverables are required for each student’s module:

1. Definition of interfaces (inputs and outputs) and module content (i.e.,  module

requirements).  Be sure to specify units for different variables.   

2. Module development:

mathematical

relationships,  software code,  and code

validation.   

3. Contribution to the Concurrent Engineering exercises. 

4. Module refinement:

list features to be refined,  mathematical alterations,  software

code, and code validation.

relations, code, validation, and use history.   

6.0 COMMUNICATIONS

6.1 Daily Communications

An email list will be established. 

It should be used to

augment communication between individuals and groups in the class. Faculty will not be

on this list.

6.2 Weekly Communications

The instructor staff will meet weekly (time and place TBD) to discuss

progress in the class.  Representatives from the class will on occasion be asked to come

and talk with the staff at this meeting. 

Each student will from time to time give informal progress reports for their team. 

Report assignments will be made as the semester evolves. The purpose of the reports is to

make the other students aware of the progress and needs of that team.  These reports will

summarize the progress of that student’s team,  plans for near term work,  and solicit and

information needed from other teams.   

6.3 Oral Presentations

High quality presentations are important for communication of what you are

doing.  Every student is expected to make at least one oral presentation during the term. 

The oral presentations are listed below.  Part of the grade for each student will be on the

technical contribution to all formal presentations as well as on the delivery of their

portion of presentations.  A small group of students will be assigned to coordinate each of

these presentations (a different coordinating group for each presentation).  These reviews

are discussed in more detail below:

1. System Requirements Review (SRR): The primary objective is to present and formally

accept the written Requirements Document.  This is the guiding document for the

development of the telescope architecture options that will comprise the bulk of the

Massachusetts Institute of Technology

15

Dept of Aeronautics and Astronautics, ESD

work for the course.  It is critical that the class agree early on what requirements the

system will have to satisfy.  A design effort without clearly stated requirements is

doomed to failure.  

2. Preliminary Design Review (PDR): The teams will each present the status of their

individual design efforts,  showing how their selected architectures meet the design

requirements.  

3. Critical Design Review (CDR): This will be a unified presentation for the entire class. 

The main content will be the telescope architecture that the class recommends NASA

to implement.  The process that was followed for arriving at this architecture as well

as supporting rationale (calculations …) must also be included. 

6.4 Documents

The lasting value of the work done for this course will consist primarily of the two

documents which the class will produce.  The documents will include sections written at

two different levels.  The documents must be technically correct and should represent an

appropriate level of work for MIT  graduate students; however,  if the work is to have an

impact outside MIT,  the documents should include sections addressed to non-technical

audiences,  people with an interest in space but not a high level of technical expertise

(such as the media or congressional staffers).  

The following two (2) documents will be prepared,  maintained and eventually

integrated by the class.  Always reference the sources of information and ideas in the

documents.  These documents must be electronic in nature and accessible to the entire

team. 

1. Requirements Document: defines the “goods and services” that are required of the

design.  This document constitutes the “contract” between the customer and the

systems engineering and architecting team.  Sometimes,  part of this document is

written by the customer.  At other times, it results from a study by the systems team to

determine the needs of a customer in order to assess the viability of a new product. 

For the Spring 2007 design project,  the class will determine the design

Massachusetts Institute of Technology

16

Dept of Aeronautics and Astronautics, ESD

requirements flowing from the NASA Lunar Architecture Study mentioned

earlier in this document. 

2. Design Document: captures the specifications for the system.  It also captures the

rationale that

led to these specifications.  To this end,  the trades analysis, 

requirements pushback,  budgets,  system and sub-system designs,  analysis tools and

simulation results are included.  Requirements pushback is the analysis that verifies

that the design meets the requirements.  This is in contrast to the requirements

flowdown,  which simply allocates requirements with minimal knowledge of the

implications of these allocations.  Requirements pushback is essential to determine

whether the design meets the requirements and whether one or more part of the

overall system is facing particularly stringent requirements while others face more

lenient requirements.  This allows proper balancing of the allocated requirements.

6.5 Web Page

A web page will be maintained as the electronic repository of the current

16.89/ESD.352 documents. This page

will provide all team members access to the current versions of the program documents.  

In addition,  it will enable our engineering advisors to have access to this same

information.  This will allow them to track the progress of the class and provide

comments and suggestions throughout the duration of the semester. 

It is the students’ responsibility to check frequently if updates or new materials and

announcements have been posted. 

7.0 GRADING

Grading for 16.89/ESD.352 will be based upon the criteria shown in the following

table.  The percentage weights of each item and a brief description are provided.  These

grades will be reported to the students in their end-of-term grades as well as at least once

during the term.

1) Written documents: Each student will author portions of the two required documents.  

Their contribution will be clearly indicated using initials. 

2) Oral presentations: Each student is required to participate in at least one of the oral

presentations during the semester.  The faculty and outside advisors will grade both

the students’ presentations as well as the quality of the presentation material.

3) Formal presentation View Graphs: Each formal design review presentation will be

accompanied by annotated viewgraphs provided electronically and in written form by

the students to the faculty.  Each student’s contribution to the written presentation will

be indicated by their initials. 

4) Colleague reviews: Students will

turn in,  shortly before Spring break,  their

evaluations of their student colleagues.  These will include discussions of the ways in

which each student interacted with other students in the class,  the usefulness of these

interactions,  areas in which the other students excel,  and areas in which the other

students can improve.  If none of the students say that they worked with you,  it will

reflect poorly on your team working skills.  The specific format of this evaluation will

be discussed later. 

5) Software development: Each student will be responsible for the development of some

software or analysis that contributes to the class design effort.  In some cases, 

contributions other than software may be used instead. 

6) Class Participation: This design project is a team effort.  Class attendance and full

participation is critical and will be graded.

Academic Honesty: The fundamental principle of academic integrity is that you must

fairly represent the source of the intellectual content of work that you submit for credit. 

16.89 is a design course heavily dependent on teamwork.  It is important that individual

contributions to the team effort be properly identified.
