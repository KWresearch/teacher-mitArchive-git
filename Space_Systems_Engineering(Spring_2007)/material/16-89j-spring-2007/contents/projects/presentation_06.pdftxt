16.89 / ESD 352 Design Challenge

(cid:122) This year’s 16.89/ESD.352 Space Systems 
Engineering class will engage in the question of how 
to best architect and design a future, extensible 
planetary surface transportation system.  The system 
will be designed for the Moon with considerations for 
eventual adaptation to Mars. In addition, the class will 
consider how a terrestrial version of the lunar 
transportation system can be built for testing in lunar 
and Mars analog sites on the Earth.

Earth, Moon, Mars Transportation
(cid:122) Earth
(cid:132) Use of regular ATVs such as those currently present at 
Mars Haughton (delivered by Twin Otter plane)
(cid:138) Minimalist solution, possible because no towing required
(cid:132) Transportation of camper
(cid:138) Delivery to Resolute Bay using barge, drive to Haughton-Mars over the 
ice (like Humvee at Haughton-Mars)
(cid:138) Likely the most cost-effective solution, although time consuming
(cid:138) Notional schedule: ship during the summer, drive over the ice the 
following winter
(cid:122) Moon
(cid:132) Delivery of UPVs and campers with a dedicated cargo 
launch (1 CaLV, 15-20 mt delivery capacity)
(cid:132) Alternatively: delivery of campers as re-supply vehicles for 
a lunar outpost, delivery of UPVs with crew, no dedicated 
CaLV launch required

16.89 / ESD 352 Space Systems Engineering

Slide 7/94

Key Ground Rules & Assumptions
(cid:122) Earth, Moon, and Mars systems are used for both exploration 
and operational testing / improvement
(cid:122) The mobility architecture selection is driven by DRM-1 and DRM-
2 operations on the Moon and Mars
(cid:122) Earth system employs Moon / Mars architecture for operational 
commonality
(cid:122) Mobility system masses and geometries have to be within 
transportation system capabilities for Earth, Moon, and Mars
(cid:132) Earth appears to be most stringent if existing capabilities are used
(cid:122) Crew operates always in groups of at least two
(cid:122) Worst-case overhead over straight-line distance is 1.5 (3 for 
round-trip)
(cid:132) Derived from Apollo traverses; factor 1.5 for intentional deviations 
from straight-line (e.g. Apollo 17 EVA-3)

Slide 8/94

Surface Mobility Element Model
(cid:122) Three different types of vehicles can be modeled / 
sized parametrically on subsystem level:

(cid:132) Open rover
(cid:138) Can tow other elements
(cid:138) Can hold cargo
(cid:138) Provides accommodations for crew in EVA suits

(cid:132) Camper
(cid:138) Provides pressurized environment for crew
(cid:138) Is not capable of driving without towing vehicle

(cid:132) Pressurized rover
(cid:138) Provides pressurized environment for crew
(cid:138) Is self-propelled
(cid:138) Can be utilized to tow other elements

(cid:122) DRM-1 excursions represent local traverses in the vicinity of a 
pressurized habitat, not unlike traverses on Apollo J-type missions
(cid:122) DRM-2 excursions represent long-range excursions 10s to 100s of km 
away from the outpost and require independent habitation
(cid:122) Organizing the DRM-2 excursions into traverse days and exploration 
days provides the opportunity for conducting DRM-1 excursions from 
the mobile habitat much like from the outpost
(cid:132) Potential cost / risk reduction and learning effects from operational 
commonality, reuse of procedures

DRM-1 traverses (60 km range) can be carried out with the entire crew, or 
leaving behind part of the crew back at base / at the LSAM
Apart from exploration, DRM-1 traverses are also relevant for accessing the 
base in case of a long landing (in this case all crew have to be transported)
All crew on traverse have to be able to return to base in case of an SPE and 
after loss of one unpressurized vehicle within 3 hours
For each option, average speed was varied from 10-20 km/h, and different 
power generation  technologies were analyzed

loss of one unpressurized vehicle during DRM-1 type operations
All vehicles utilize fuel cells (independent of sunshine and solar elevation, more 
efficient than batteries)
Pressurized vehicles provide protection and life-support to wait out a SPE

(cid:138) Speed (8-18 km/hr)
(cid:132) DRM-2
(cid:138) Sortie Days (3-10 days)
(cid:138) Range (240-360 km for Moon, 480-720 km for Mars)
(cid:138) Speed (8-16 km/hr for Moon, 6-16 km/hr for Mars)
(cid:122) Variation of these parameters had no major impact on 
the final architecture selection

Lunar Architecture Selection
(cid:122) 2 2-person campers and 3 unpressurized rovers sized 
for towing a camper
(cid:122) 2 of the same unpressurized rovers are used for 
mobility on sortie missions
(cid:122) Rationale:
(cid:132) 1 pressurized vehicle is not 
acceptable because long-range 
exploration capability is lost 
when this vehicle is damaged / 
permanently unavailable
(cid:132) 2 pressurized vehicles provide 
more safety margin
(cid:132) Assumed that the lunar base 
can be left unattended for short 
periods of time.

(cid:132) 2 pressurized vehicles provide

(cid:132) It is assumed that the base is never 
unattended on Mars (2 crew stay 
behind)
(cid:132) 1 additional unpressurized vehicle 
is left behind at the base during 
long-range exploration

(cid:122) Utilizing a pressurized rover in concert with unpressurized vehicles (UPVs) results in 
duplication of functionality:
(cid:132) Additional functionality for steering and navigation in pressurized rover (cockpit)
(cid:132) This additional functionality results in a power, volume, and mass penalty compared to using a camper 
(excess mass must be transported during the entire traverse)
(cid:122) Using campers that are guided by UPVs represents a minimalist solution to long-range 
surface mobility
(cid:122) Camper crew compartment is inherently similar to the human lunar lander crew compartment 
(option for commonality, synergy)

Mobility System Design

16.89 / ESD 352 Space Systems Engineering

Slide 19/94

Mobility Design Approach

(cid:122) First design the lunar camper 
and UPV for DRM 1 & 2, then 
study the delta to Earth and 
Mars designs
(cid:122) Vehicle design is broken 
down by subsystem and 
coded into MATLAB modules
(cid:122) Vehicle characteristics are 
determined by iteratively 
running each subsystem 
module
(cid:122) MUSE verifies the feasibility 
of vehicles’ design

(cid:122) LoS implies:
(cid:132) All obstacles below LoS path
(cid:132) Received energy approximately 
the same as transmitted energy 
less space loss due to distance

(cid:122) Relaxing LoS assumption:
(cid:132) Range will increase but received 
energy subject to knife-edge 
diffraction losses

Communication Conclusions

(cid:122) Relay requirements are site specific
(cid:132) Not just dependent on terrain type

(cid:122) Rougher terrain requires more relays
(cid:132) But even smooth terrain needs one every 20 m
(cid:132) Inevitably large number of relays of reasonable size 

(cid:122) Significant improvements with higher relays (> 0.5 m)

(cid:122) Alternate deployment schemes & terrain effects could 
help lower the number of required relays

shielding and life-support to survive and wait out a 
solar particle event (SPE)
(cid:122) There exists a capability to forecast major flares with 
lag times between electromagnetic and particle 
radiation of less than an hour

(cid:132) Opportunity for commonality
