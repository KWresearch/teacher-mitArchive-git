Paradigm Shift in Design for 
NASA’s New Exploration Initiative
The result of MIT’s space systems engineering  
graduate design class study

Welcome….

The following presentation outlines the results of MIT’s graduate space systems 
design class study of NASA’s new exploration system.

The presentation focuses on how the new exploration initiative should be designed, 
as opposed to the more common single-point design.

1

The Vision
• On January 14, 2004 President George W. Bush 
presented the nation with a…

“new plan to explore space and extend a human 
presence across our solar system. [The nation will] 
begin the effort quickly, using existing programs and 
personnel. [The nation will] make steady progress --
one mission, one voyage, one landing at a time.” *

• As a result, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
has been given the task of developing a sustainable human space 
exploration program, which will take humans back to the Moon by 2020, 
then to Mars, and eventually beyond.

* President George W Bush’s address to the Nation. Jan 14, 2004

On Jan 14, 2004 President Bush presented the nation with a new vision for space. 
President Bush’s Vision called for NASA to develop a sustainable space exploration 
system which would bring the US back to the moon no later than the year 2020, 
with the goal of traveling to Mars, and then eventually beyond.

However, the new directive for NASA raises to main questions:

1. What does the design of a sustainable space exploration system consist of and 
how can NASA go about designing this system.
Maybe even more general of a question is, What is a sustainable 
space system?

2. For the past couple of decades, NASA’s main focus has no been on exploring. 
This raise the question of what is to be gained by an exploration system. 
What is the goal of exploration? How does one value an exploration 

system?

2

Motivation
Moon, Mars and Beyond

In support of this vision, NASA must design 
a SUSTAINABLE space exploration 
system.

The purpose of an exploration system is to 
DELIVER KNOWLEDGE to all 
stakeholders.

The motivation behind MIT’s graduate space systems design class report is to 
describe how NASA’s  should focus it’s design methodologies towards the design of 
the new space exploration initiative.

The two main points of the presentation are:

NASA must develop a rigorous design method focusing on the development of a 
SUSTAINABLE space exploration system
- and -
NASA must understanding that the purpose of an exploration system is to deliver 
knowledge to the stakeholders

What is the goal of the design? How does one being the design process? 
The first step in designing the new exploration initiative is to develop a strategy, a way in which the 
development process will be implemented. President Bush laid out two main milestones for the new 
exploration initiative. The first step in the nations exploration path will be to return to the Moon. The 
next step will be to use what was learned at the moon and then use that knowledge to go onto Mars.

But how should NASA reach these two goals while maintaining a sustainable space system. MIT 
graduate design class has viewed strategy as an evolutionary path of increasingly difficult missions, 
each one building on the next.  The first step will be to regain the capability of the Apollo program by 
returning to the moon, but only for a small period of time. The next step will be to perform longer 
science gathering and technology test-bed missions. The last phase of moon missions is long 
duration mission that utilizes a  semi-permanent habitation facility, similar to that which would be 
required for Mars.

Once the Moon test-bed missions have been completed, or policy has shifted, the next step will be a 
short mars mission. The evolutionary path for Mars will be similar to that of the moon with each 
mission building on the previous. With the Mars there exists the option of a pre-mission to the Martian 
moon phobos. A mission to phobos could be used as a technology demonstrator much like Apollo 8 
was used. However, in this case the crew could gain additional knowledge with phobos instead of 
simply orbiting Mars.

Overview of Design Process

Identify commonality (iterative)
• Staged mission story-lines
• Function and form matrices
• Commonality Mapping
Evaluate revised architecture
• Key trades
• Decision Analysis and Real 
Options
Create baseline architecture
• Strategy that is flexible in the 
face of uncertainty

16.89 Graduate Design Class (Spring 2004)

Once the strategy was completed, the nest step was to complete a design process.
This presentation will describe one way in which NASA could go about designing a sustainable space system. 
Note that at this point in time this is only a conceptual design methodology. This design methodology is not the 
answer to the problem, but simply one way in which NASA could proceed.

The design process starts out by looking at existing studies, legacy hardware and by defining individual staged 
missions.

The next step is then to define the different capabilities, or “functions”, that are required to complete the 
individual missions.
Once the required functions have been complied, generic forms are created to perform these functions. 
(Form Function mapping)

After completing the form/function mapping, the forms are compared across all the missions in an attempt to 
define any common elements. The above process is repeated several times. 

Note that the examples in this presentation are the results of one pass through this iteration.

Once an appropriate amount of iteration has been performed, modern analysis tools are applied to the designs. 
These analysis tools consist of, but are not limited to decision analysis, scenario planning, utility theory, and real 
options theory.

The last step is to combine all the design decisions into an integrated strategy for the development path of the 
exploration system

The remainder of this presentation focuses on the class’ proposed design 
methodology and how that system should be evaluated with respect to knowledge.

The next section will discuss the characteristics that make a system sustainable

The following section will focus on how knowledge is the deliverable in an 
exploration system and how knowledge pertain to the design of NASA’s new 
exploration system

The final section of the presentation will go over the proposed deign process. This 
section will focus on developing individual mission strategies, form/function mapping 
to identify common elements, and modern analysis tools with which to evaluate the 
designs.

Elements Sustainability
• Sustainable - Capable of being maintained 
over an extended lifecycle.  

• Types of Sustainability
– Policy
– Budgetary Uncertainty
– Organizational
– Technical/Supply chain sustainability

16.89 Graduate Design Class (Spring 2004)

Sustainability can be looked at as a systems capability to be maintained over an 
extended lifecycle. Sustainability comes in many different types, but some of the 
more common types of sustainability consist of a system reaction to policy, 
budgetary, organizational, and technical/supply chain uncertainties. The different 
types of sustainability interact with one another and form a cyclic relationship What 
is important to understand is that a system must account for all these form of 
sustainability if the system will be sustainable into the future. 

In an attempt to better understand what it takes to be a sustainable space 
infrastructure, we will first look at what is not a sustainable space architecture. 
There are two example of non-sustainable space architectures: they are the Apollo 
and shuttle programs.
•The Apollo program can be viewed as non-sustainable due to the high costs 
associated with the design and a shift in policy. Apollo was not a sustainable system 
because it could not be maintained by the current budget in the face of policy 
change.
•The Shuttle is not sustainable due to the shuttle’s inflexibility towards new 
technology and the high maintenance / operations cost. The high costs and 
constraints of associated with the refurbishment of the shuttle have made it very 
difficult for new technology to be infused into the system.

8

Historical Example of Sustainability
: 
Antarctic Exploration
• Exploration proceeded in 
distinct stages, enabled 
by incorporation of 
multiple technologies.
– Heroic Age (1895-1915): 
Liquid Fuel
– Modern Age (1928-Present): 
Airplanes and Radio
• Shifts highlight interplay 
between technical/political

16.89 Graduate Design Class (Spring 2004)

An example of a sustainable exploration program is the exploration of Antarctica. 
The interesting fact about Antarctica is that  Antarctica was never designed to be 
sustainable, but evolved into a sustainable program.

This evolution can be seen by the two ages of Antarctica exploration; the Heroic 
and Modern age. The transition was in part due to the infusion of new technologies 
(More than one technology come together: the airplane and the radio). However, 
the reason for the shift between periods was due to the interaction of technical and 
political factors. It is this interaction that allowed a new era of Antarctican
exploration to begin.
Finally, the exploration Antarctica is still being maintained today because the 
system is able to evolve with the changes in new technology and political issues.

Today, we find ourselves on a similar edge to a new era in space exploration.  Over 
the past decade new technologies have been developed that will aid in the 
exploration of space. With President Bush’s speech, political interests have aligned 
themselves with these new technologies in support of space exploration. More 
recently, NASA is being reorganized as a response to the new space exploration 
initiative. So, All the key ingredients exist for a shift towards a new era of 
sustainable space exploration.

Extensibility Supports Sustainability

can be added to a system in such 
a way as to alter the value

Finally another attribute of a sustainable design is that the system is extensible into the future. Above is a 
conceptual example of how developing an extensible system supports sustainability.
In the graph you can see a plot of the demand for capability vs time. Notice that throughout time the desired, or 
ideal, capability can either increase or decrease. 
At one point in time, traditional design methods would results in a single point design with a given capability. 
This capability could be either above or below the current demand. 

As time goes on the, ideal capability of the system changes and the traditional point design is no longer ideal.
Under these circumstance the common approach to take would be to develop another point design, say D2, in 
order to meet the current demand.

The idea behind extensibility is that the system is flexible to changes in the future . For example: initially our 
extensible design might have the same capability as our point design, D1. However, the design of the extensible 
system is such that as the demand changes the system can be modified, at a lower cost, such that it’s capability 
can be raised or lowered. The significance of this extensible design is that a single design can be modified such 
that it meets current demand throughout time, as opposed to being forced to design  new single-point systems 
over and over again.

In real life, it would not be possible for an extensible system for following the ideal capability demand path 
precisely. Therefore, the evolution of any extensible system is more than likely to happen in jumps or spurts, 
very much in the same way computer software manufactures release new version of computer code.

The point to take away is that extensible systems, by their nature, support sustainability. Because the future is 
uncertain, extensible systems can react to changes in demand and therefore can be sustained into the future.

• STS-derived launchers
– Mass to orbit: 93,000kg

• Single SRB with upper stage
– Mass to orbit:

• Human-rated EELV
– Mass to orbit: 18,000kg

Human-rated EELV

16.89 Graduate Design Class (Spring 2004)

19

All mass to orbit numbers are to LEO 28.8

After calculating the capabilities that could be achieved with a different 
configurations of legacy hardware including: STS launchers (a shuttle stack 
replacing the orbiter with a payload pod) derived , SRB derived launchers (a solid 
rocket booster from the shuttle with a large cryogenic second stage on top), Foreign 
launchers (such as the heavy versions of the A5), the EELV families (evolved 
expendable launch vehicles, the Atlas V and Delta IV families), EELV derived 
approaches, and completely new systems. We have come to the conclusion that the 
most attractive technically and also the most cost effective architecture should be 
built around two launchers. A heavy one for cargo only based on the STS and lifting 
about 100 metric tons to LEO.  And a Heavy EELVs such as the Delta IV Heavy for 
transporting Humans.

This is for your info in case they ask questions about this:
The engines of the STS derived would not be reusable and would use exactly the 
same ones that the DeltaiIV Heavy, that is three RS68s. This allows economy of 
scale.
After separation from the external tank a cryogenic upperstage provides the last 
part of the Delta-IV. It is a cryogenic upper stage similar to that of the Apollo third 
stage and it is the most complex part that has to be developed.

Extensible System Strategy
• Knowledge must be transferred in the form of 
“bits and atoms”
– A communications architecture will aid in knowledge 
return and support exploration system operations
– An extensible set of forms will deliver mass to and from 
the Earth
• A continuum of individual mission profiles are 
possible for each destination
– Missions divided into three classes per destination
• Moon: Short, Medium and Extended
• Mars: Short, Extended and Extended+
• Outlier mission: Phobos

Common forms are highlighted.
The Crew Operations Vehicle (COV) is functionally similar to the Apollo Command 
Module, capable of transporting a crew of three and supporting the crew for a short 
duration mission. The Habitation Module (HM) is an extensible habitable volume, 
made up of separable modules.  This module can sustain life for long duration 
missions.  When these two modules dock, they form the Crew Exploration System 
(CES).  The Service Module (SM) is capable of providing propulsion for transiting 
the crew from Earth to destination or destination to Earth.  In combination with the 
COV and HM, this module is defined as the Moon/Mars Transfer Vehicle (MTV).  
The Mars Landers (ML) or the Lunar Landers (LL) are functionally similar to the 
Apollo type lander (slightly different forms for Moon and Mars) and capable of 
transporting three crewmembers from orbit to the surface and back into orbit.  In 
addition to containing the crew during launch and transferring the three 
crewmembers to the HM in LEO, the Modern Command Module (MCM) is 
functionally similar to the COV, but can return crew back to Earth from LEO at the 
end of the mission.  These modules are summarized in Table 1.

calculated as ~55,000kg  for a crew of six, depending on a number of critical  factors 
(mission duration,  type of  radiation protection,  life  support,  supplies, aeroshield and 
power requirements).

The  use  of  truncated  octahedrons  increases  spacecraft  flexibility  and  was  inspired 
by work from Nadir, Bounova & de Weck.  The use of truncated octahedrons,
− Allow 3-D objects to pack together without voids,
− Permit  the highest  ratio of  volume  to  surface area of all  close packing 3D  shapes 
(no voids) to be utilized, and
- Allow for significant modular spacecraft design flexibility

Six  octahedrons  were  combined  in  two  groups  of  three  and  platform,  forming  one 
large volume required for a Mars mission.  Based on Larson (1999), it was assumed 
that  a  habitable  volume  of  20m3 per  person  was  required  for  a  6  crew,  6-month 
mission.  For this analysis, 30m3 was specified per person.  It was also assumed by 
Larson  (1999)  that  33%  of  the  total  volume  was  assumed  to  be  habitable.  
Therefore, a  total volume of 540m3 could be created by 6 octahedrons, each with a 
5.6m diameter. 

An interesting observation is the number of different forms that must have docking 
capabilities with the HM.  Since the HM module will be docking with the COV, SM1,

For  comparison  purposes,  it  is  clear  that  common  functions  are  shared.    When 
common functions exist, extensibility will benefit the overall group of missions  to  the 
Moon and Mars.   The  lander must dock with  the COV or  the COV/HM  in both  lunar 
and Martian orbit.   As well,  the  lander must deliver a crew of 6 to  the  surface  for all 
of  the Mars missions  and  some  of  the  Moon  missions.    If  two  identical  landers  are 
chosen  instead  of  a  single,  larger  lander,  the  impact  of  this  decision  can  be 
observed  by  evaluating  whether  or  not  the  new  option  satisfies  the  functional 
requirements.    If all of  the  functions are deemed satisfied, only  then was  the  impact 
of  the  decision  not  critical.    As  can  be  expected,  a  wide  range  of  requirements  are 
made  for  the  landers,  but many  of  these  requirements  are  specified  by  only  one  of 
the seven missions, making it difficult  to  justify changing  the baseline  form.    Indeed, 
the  landers  are  a  mission  critical  piece  of  hardware  and  must  be highly  reliable. 
Therefore,  when  considering  extensibility  of  such  a  device,  it  may  be  beneficial  to 
target  the  lander  design  for  the  most  difficult  landing  mission, thereby  ensuring  a 
robust,  if  over-designed,  form  for  the  other  missions.  This  has  the  effect  of 
increasing  net  reliability  while  still  maintaining  an  extensible form.  The  idea  of 
designing  a  non-optimal  form  now  such  that  it  may  be  optimal  when  used  in  a 
different manner or location stands as one of the cornerstones of extensibility.

Stage 1 (powered descent delta_V) includes ±4.5 km lateral translation capability for 
dispersion accommodation and landing target site redesignation.
An effort was made to keep as much similarity between the lunar and Martian 
Landers as possible.  However, since the environment on the Moon and Mars is so 
different, only a portion of each Lander design is identical.  This is the crew 
compartment.  The rocket stages are similar because they use the same propulsion 
technology but vary in size (significantly differnet deltaV requirements).  The major 
differences are the parachute, heat shield, and deployable landing structure 
required for the Martian Lander.

ISPP(cid:198) allows for a reduced IMLEO and utilizes the Martian environment to enable 
sustained exploration at low mission cost (over time)
ISRU (cid:198) reduces IMLEO and takes advantage of available resources (cid:198) useful for 
future missions (i.e solar radiation for power, soil for radiation shielding, water from 
the permafrost)
Closed loop life support (cid:198) provides for self-sufficiency, and increased knowledge 
for adjusting to environment…..also increase crew mental health

Nuclear power (cid:198) 100kw – class nuclear reactors can provide an effective means of 
power for life support to enable extended surface operations and increase mission 
flexibility.

IMPORTANT POINT= MOR3 (return fuel, landers, and S.H are pre-positioned by 
EP and the IMLEO is the LEAST for this type)
Assumptions:  No aerobraking at Mars, direct entry at Earth, includes IMLEO for EP 
pre-positioned elements.  The DV’s refer to the Opposition w/ Venus fly by. 
Names of architectures NOVA = Direct to surface, MOR = MOR, but we bring 
landers and return fuel…the only thing pre-positioned is the Surface Hab, MOR2 = 
landers and S.H are pre-positioned, MOR3 = Landers, S.H. and RETURN FUEL are 
pre-positioned.
All pre-positioning of elements is done by electric propulsion Specific power of 150 
W/kg, efficiency =.7, specific impulse 3200 sec.  This means that the IMLEO for the 
human missions is EVEN less for MOR3 than MOR2….

Important things… the Venus fly-by is the only feasible option for short stay….even 
w/ aerobraking, the 2milliion kg in LEO is prohibitive.  Notes:  This is only for the 
manned trajectory, assuming MOR3 (pre-positioning of landers, earth return fuel, 
and S.H.)  Thus, the IMLEO of all pre-positioned elements are not included in these 
numbers.  You want to note that 1) No Venus fly-by, even w/ aerobraking is too 
large.  2) That aerobraking reduce IMLEO for all missions (conjunction too, but not 
enough to be shown on this plot) 3) That the difference in IMLEO for Conjunction 
and Fast transfer w/ aerobraking is small enough (Fast transfer have higher mass) 
but the Total travel time is much shorter.
Other notes:  The Venus fly-by may have other issues, such as increased radiation 
from the inner Earth orbit pass, but allows for 60 day stays.  Fast transfer has very 
long stays on the surface, but the reduced time of flight allows for each transfer leg 
to be equivalent to some of the ISS stays, so that zero gravity and space radiation 
are no longer unknowns.

nature.
• Used to determine the degree to which a system 
responds to environmental change
– Critical contingencies may be planned into the final

these scenarios
– Options exercised allowing for significant adaptability to

Scenario: NASA Policy Change
• Description: Budget cut due to lack of public interest. NASA 
restricted to education and Earth-monitoring activities.
• Response: Very little can be done in the face of restrictive 
policy directives.
– Knowledge collected before budget cut will inspire future 
generations to continue space exploration.
• Prevention strategy: Public interest must be maintained. 
Regular (e.g. yearly) milestones and frequent press releases 
are recommended. 
– Frequent milestones serve as points for program to self-
evaluate and to address new information. Contributes to 
sustainable and extensible program.
– Associated trade: How much money should be spent on 
public awareness of NASA activities?

Scenario: Nuclear Propulsion
• Description: Nuclear propulsion technology is 
developed and becomes mainstream.
• Response: Modular architecture of propulsion 
system allows for creation of new nuclear 
propulsion service with little redesign required for 
rest of system. 
• Benefits realized: Shorter transit times to Mars 
result in decrease in initial mass to LEO and human 
factors-related benefits.
– Modular, extensible system allows for ready utilization of 
new, upgraded technology.
– Associated real option: Design capability to easily 
transition from current to other propulsion?

Different vectors will express different decisions of the design space. The design space is as deep as 
we intend that the whole system to be, including all the different decisions to be taken: modules size, 
number of expeditions, amount of budget available, technologies to be used, etc
A utility can be assigned to every of this architectures in the sense that a Rational Decision maker will

preference

The needs as expressed by the stakeholders can have different levels of importance and can be 
contradictory.
An order is needed, and some merit figures need to be found

To do so a hierarchy is established, and the needs are arranged in a tree like structure. At the lowest 
level, there will be a set of performance measures. Some of them will be “hard physics” but others 
will just be constructed scales, such as “a level 3 of probability of shipping fuel from the moon”

To assess the preference, and the relative utility of each level or hard physics value, a set of experts 
who represent the decision maker stakeholders are surveyed about their preferences. These 
stakeholders range from the technical field to the political one, in order to synthesize the objectives of 
all the parties involved. 

For each performance, pairwise comparisons is surveyed, and through some math, a function that
maps levels to preferences, (and thus utilities) is found. A similar pairwise comparisons is done at the 
categories, and therefore a set of weights for this performances and categories is found (Sigma 
below)

These weights and functions are not absolute numbers, they just express the opinions of a group of 
people.
This method for the same reason is not a hard number, but instead a tool to argue, and discuss, but 
to focus on an objective, and get a compromise solution.

The set of decisions that define an architecture are taken overtime, and are therefore possible to be 
arranged in a tree, with branching points each time a decision has to be taken. The decisions are 
drawn as squares at our tree diagram.
Another point where the design space branches is at Chance nodes. At these nodes a certain event, 
the outcome of an external event gets to be known. Previous to that we do know though, the 
probabilities of the different results. These points are drawn as circles in our diagram.

Once we established the tree, we use the Utility function already identified to assign utilities to each 
architecture. At each Decision node the DM will choose the higher utility, at each chance node, using 
the probabilities, an expected utility is assigned.
We arrive at the case that by choosing to get the ability to go to L1 the expected utility is 0.574, and 
by not choosing it is 0.417. Therefore the DM will choose to have that capability in this very simplified 
example

Conclusions
Therefore, NASA needs to:
– Base decisions on the value of the knowledge 
returned, not only the cost or mass of a design
– Develop a rigorous design methodology focusing 
on sustainability
• Identify common architectural elements between the 
Moon missions and Mars missions (form/function 
mapping)
• Not design with traditional optimality in mind
• Use modern system architecting tools such as decision 
analysis and real options

Conclusions
NASA needs to incorporate sustainability into every level of the design of the space 
exploration architecture.
Then talk about how to do it quantitatively….there may be a process.  
-by applying form function mapping (re-highlight the process)
-highlight commonality idea
“not just” the cost or mass of the design
Use Modern system architecting tools such as scenario planning, decision analysis

Emphasize that inter-level dependencies exist (eg. mass of reentry system depends 
on habital module).  Links between levels represent preferable or feasible options.  
For example, the lake/coastal landing site option requires a reentry system with a 
large cross-range capability for precisely landing into a small body of water 
(inflatable or parafoil).  More information provided in the EDL (entry, descent, and 
landing) and Landing site slides.

Three metrics were used: mass, TRL, Rank.
Rank was used because it enables 
-to have a normalized comparison across elements. For example, launch escape 
system shouldn’t be chosen for the same reason than EDL elements. Each element 
of the CES (each row in the network) has its own criteria.
-To compare each option into a row with different metrics… while trying to assess 
each option as objectively as possible for trading different measure of 
performance/priority
-To be able to weigh the metrics in order to make the right decision given what is 
the priority (it can be cross-range or peak deceleration for EDL architecture… then 
depending on the priority, you can weigh the metric so that the final ranking reflects 
more this priority)

Trade: Lander Sizing
Investigation of crew compartment sizing for Lunar and Martian Landers
Choices investigated:
•Size for crew of three (small)
•Size for a crew of six (large)
•“Small” Lander design benefits:
•The same Lander crew 
capsule used for all missions
•Two Landers needed for 
missions requiring a crew 
of six
•Redundancy for landing and 
ascent
•“Large” Lander design benefits:
•Mass savings for missions 
with six crew members
•“Extra” volume for missions 
with three crew members could 
be used to transport additional 
supplies

Final decision was made to use the 
“small” Lander design concept

16.89 Graduate Design Class (Spring 2004)

69

A trade study was performed to examine the tradeoffs between using a 3-person or 
a 6-person Lander design.  Since crew sizes of 3 and 6 are planned for the various 
lunar and martian missions, a vehicle that can accommodate 3 or 6 crew would be 
ideal.  The benefits of using a 3-person Lander is that you minimize mass for 3-
person crew sizes and for 6-person crew sizes, you have added redundancy for the 
landing and ascent portions of the mission since there will be two small Landers 
being used.
The advantages of the six-person Lander are a mass savings per crew member for 
the missions that have six crew members and the ability to bring more cargo along 
with the crew to the surface if there is a crew of three (the extra volume can be filled 
with extra equipment).
Finally, the 3-person Lander concept was chosen.  This was a difficult decision and 
mainly the result of needing to freeze the requirements at a certain point in our 
abbreviated design process.

Trade: Heavy Launch Cost

16.89 Graduate Design Class (Spring 2004)

70

This graph shows the cost per flight of a whole Apollo class mission (short stay) to 
the moon. It compares two approaches one using many heavy EELVs (Delta-IV 
Heavy) to launch the mission in chunks, the other sending the astronauts in a 
separate EELV and the cargo on a Heavy STS derived.
Using data from Isakowitz and the consumer price index of the Office of 
Management and Budget we have put all the cost data into FY14. Because the 
EELV has other (good) customers, such as the NRO or the DoD, the cost of an 
EELV will not depend dramatically on the flight rate. Whereas the STS based 
system has high fixed costs.
For a mission to the Moon that can be done with a single STS derived and a EELV 
for the crew or with up to six EELVs. According to our cost data the break even 
point where it costs the same to do the mission with many launches or with a single 
one is around 1.7 Apollo equivalent missions a year.
Therefore EELVs are attractive if one wants only to do a plant the flag a year.
However for a sustained commitment to human exploration it becomes clear that an 
STS derived is much more cost effective. For instance a mission to Mars in terms of 
launch requirements is equivalent of about 6 Apollos. It would be three times as 
expensive to launch it with a fleet of EELVs.

For a generic Mars transfer Mission, the table shows the resulting LEO masses for a staged and cycler transportation system 
for four different test cases:
1. No pre-positioning and No Aerobraking
2.
Pre-positioning and No Aerobraking
3. No pre-positioning and Aerobraking
Pre-positioning and Aerobraking
4.

A staged system is comparable to the Apollo style missions. At the end of each burn a stage is dropped and therefore a 
staged system would consist of multiple stages. Additionally once the staged system returned to earth, the vehicle 
would re-enter the earth’s atmosphere and do a direct descent to earth.

In a cycler system there is only one stage and there is no staging. The advantage behind the cycler system is that this 
system does no change throughout its mission and therefore could be re-used in the next mission, hence the cycler is 
seen as a reusable system. Due to the reusable nature of the cycler, fuel must be provided to the cycler during the 
mission and the cycler must re-enter earth orbit once the vehicle returns to earth. The requirement of re-establishing 
earth orbit is a major fuel and mass requirement on the system and only shows promise in the case of aerobraking and 
return fuel pre-positioning.

Another benefit of the cycler system is that the delta V required for a Mars mission, in the aerobraking and pre-positioning 
case, is approximately equal to that of a moon mission (~8km/s roundtrip). This means that if a cycler was developed, a 
common design and vehicle could be used to conduct both moon and mars missions.

The Chart show the results of the fourth cases as a function of the number of mission. You can see that because of the 
reusable nature of the cycler design, the total mass at LEO for the cycler becomes less and less to that of the Staged 
design. 

The major take away is not that the transportation system should be designed as a cycler, but that the transportation system 
should initially be designed as a staged system that would be capable of being modified into a cycler type system. 
Additionally, before any decisions concerning building a cycler system would be considered, research into aerobraking 
and pre-positioning must be conducted and proved successful.
