Executive Summary1 

The  MINERVA  mission  will  revolutionize  the  future  of  Mars  exploration  by  providing 
on-orbit  relay of  communications  to and  from Earth as well as  the  capability  for position 
determination  on  the  surface  of  the  red  planet.  The  MINERVA  infrastructure  improves 
the  extent,  reliability,  capacity  and uniformity of Mars  coverage.  From  the Mars mission 
designer’s  point  of  view, MINERVA  simplifies  the  design  process  since  future missions 
will  be  able  to  achieve  large  transfer  rates  (10  Gb/sol  divided  among  users)  for  science 
data  without  carrying  their  own  high  power  communications  systems.  Also,  these 
missions will have  a greater probability of mission  success given MINERVA’s  ability  to 
determine  their  position  on  the  surface  with  hundred-meter  accuracy.  Designers  will  be 
able  to  focus  their  efforts  on  science  collection  to  a  much  greater  degree  than  had 
previously been possible. MINERVA’s return on  investment will be  in  the form of a vast 
increase in science data collection for the taxpayer’s dollar. 

The  MINERVA  mission  design  evolved  during  the  course  of  three  distinct  phases.  The 
initial  phase  leading  up  to  the  Trade  Analysis  and  Requirements  Review  (TARR) 
involved  evaluation  and  comparison  of  three  candidate  architectures:  a  Mars  ground-
based  architecture,  an  Earth-based  architecture,  and  a  Mars  orbiting  architecture.  The 
class  looked  at  the  ability  of  the  architectures  to  perform  the  communication  and 
positioning missions, and assigned a rating in the areas of risk, reliability, robustness, and 
cost.  In  the  final  analysis,  the  Mars  orbiting  architecture  was  the  clear  winner.  A  rough 
order  of  magnitude  (ROM)  cost  analysis  made  it  clear  that  the  program’s  $300  million 
cost cap would be a major driver in the preliminary design phase. 

The  second  phase,  leading  up  to  the  Preliminary  Design  Review  (PDR),  narrowed  the 
trade  space  from  a  family  of  Mars  orbiting  architectures  to  a  single  viable  design 
solution.  In  the  process,  several  design  features,  including  heliocentric  orbits,  use  of  the 
Martian  moons,  and Mars  airplanes  were  eliminated  due  to  complexity  and  cost.  By  the 
PDR,  the  requirements  for  the  system  were  defined  in  greater  detail  and  analysis 
indicated  that  the MINERVA  system  would  be  able  to  meet  all  requirements  within  the 
cost  cap.  The  payload  design  team  defined  the  technical  approach  for  performing  the 
communication  and  position  determination  missions.  Characteristics 
for 
the 
communications  system  include  cross-link  capability  between  satellites,  a  high  gain 
antenna  for Earth  communications  and  a UHF  link  for  communication with  users  on  the 
surface  of  Mars.  The  positioning  system  uses  two-way  ranging  and  two-way  Doppler 
shift  techniques,  employing  the  same  frequency  band  as  the  communication  link  with 
Mars.  The  bus  team  evaluated  performance  of  all  required  subsystems,  including  an 
option  for  electric  propulsion.  Finally,  the  systems  group  completed  a  risk  management 
strategy, a program schedule, functional and data flows, and a methodology for getting to 
CDR.

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

In  the  critical  design  phase,  the  class  optimized  the MINERVA  design  using  concurrent 
engineering sessions in the design lab. Each group performed extensive design trades and 
analysis  of  performance  levels  to  ensure  all  requirements  were  met.  These  efforts 
established  the  detailed  system  and  subsystem  designs.  Launch  analysis  led  to  selection 
of  a  Mars  transfer  injection  using  a  Delta  III  launch  vehicle.  The  class  defined  in  detail 
the  payload  and  bus  components,  and  determined  software  functions  and  spacecraft 
autonomy  levels.  The  class  determined  that  chemical  propulsion  would  be  more  cost 
effective  than  electrical  propulsion  given  excess  launch  vehicle  performance.  The  orbits 
group, working with  payloads,  defined  the  optimal  constellation  altitude  and  inclination, 
to  maximize  performance  within  cost  constraints.  Payloads  selected  parabolic  dishes  for 
interplanetary  and  cross  link  communications,  and  a  helix  antenna  for  the  MINERVA-
Mars  link.  The  systems/operations  group  finalized  the  description  of  system  functions, 
evaluated  system  reliability,  and  used  a  design-based  Cost  Estimating  Relationship 
(CER) methodology to quantify development and operations costs. While this method has 
limited accuracy, results indicated the system could be delivered under the cost cap. 

The  final MINERVA design consists of a 4  spacecraft Walker constellation around Mars 
at an altitude of 2000 km and an inclination of 27º. Each spacecraft has a wet mass of 470 
kg  and  employs  a  chemical  propulsion  system  for  Mars  capture,  with  no  aerobraking 
requirement. The maximum  spacecraft  revisit  time  for  the  required  coverage band  is  less 
than  30  minutes.  MINERVA  provides  a  reduced  level  of  coverage  up  to  65º  North  and 
South of the equator. The system achieves 100-meter accuracy for position determination 
within  6  hours  at  15  degrees  latitude  and  within  90  minutes  at  the  equator.  In  the  worst 
case  scenario  (maximum  planetary  separation)  MINERVA’s  communication  throughput 
meets or exceeds 10 Gb/sol.  

The  class  learned  several  valuable  lessons  through  working  on  the  MINERVA  design 
project. Our  efforts  to  retain  design  flexibility  allowed  innovative  thinking,  but  the  team 
reached  a point where  a  significant  reduction of  the  trade  space was  essential  in order  to 
meet  design  review  milestones.  The  biggest  challenge,  especially  given  the  large  class 
size,  was  maintaining  communication  between  the  different  groups.  The  class  instituted 
the practice of  frequent  integration meetings,  in which  the systems group met with group 
representatives  to  discuss  technical  issues  and  status.  The  class  observed  that  the 
transitions  between  phases  of  design  work  were  potential  stumbling  blocks  if  they  were 
not  handled  crisply.  Recognition  of  this  phenomenon  led  to  a  much  more  rapid  and 
effective  transition  after  the  PDR  than  had  taken  place  after  the  TARR.  The  class  found 
concurrent engineering  to be a useful practice  for rapid characterization of a multitude of 
design  options.  It was  essential  to  continue  the  detailed  design  analysis work  in  between 
sessions to clarify which options should be evaluated in concurrent engineering. 

Most  of  all,  the  class  learned  about  the  challenges  of  doing  systems  engineering  for  a 
major  design  project  in  a  large  group  setting.  Tools,  theory,  and  methodology  were 
important,  but  so was  the  dynamic  of  human  interaction.  In  the  end,  the  people  are what 
determine the level of project success.

Mission Statement2 

US  leadership  in  space  exploration  has  inspired  a  generation  of  Americans  and  people 
throughout  the  world.  Looking  to  the  future,  US  space  policy  calls  for  a  “strong 
commitment  to  space  science”  and  tasks  NASA  to  “undertake  a  sustained  program  to 
support a robotic presence on  the surface of Mars.” To facilitate  future Mars exploration, 
NASA  must  put  in  place  an  infrastructure  to  support  communication,  position 
determination  and  Mars  observation  functions.  NASA’s  implementation  of  this 
infrastructure  must  be  innovative,  flexible  and  robust  to  maximize  the  benefit  obtained 
for the taxpayer’s dollars. 

The  Mars  infrastructure  will  enhance  the  capabilities  of  future  robotic  missions  while 
significantly  reducing  their  cost.  This  magnification  of  capability  will  provide  improved 
opportunities  for  international  cooperation  as  well  as  increasing  public  awareness  and 
involvement  in  Mars  exploration.  Ultimately,  the  Mars  infrastructure  will  be  a  key 
enabler for establishing a human presence on Mars.

Mission Overview3 

The  goal  of  the  MINERVA  mission  is  to  establish  an  infrastructure  to  support  future 
missions  to  Mars.  The  system  we  have  developed,  to  meet  the  specified  requirements 
within cost and schedule constraints, consists of four satellites. Distributed evenly around 
Mars  in  two  orbital  planes,  these  satellites  will  facilitate  communication  and  navigation 
for surface explorers over much of the planet. 

There  are  three  main  phases  of  the  MINERVA  mission:  setup,  on-orbit  operations,  and 
disposal. This section provides a brief overview of each phase. 

3.1 

Set-up 

The MINERVA system  is scheduled  to  lift-off on August 18, 2007, on a Delta  III  launch 
vehicle.  It  will  cruise  briefly  around  the  Earth  before  boosted  into  a  hyperbolic,  trans-
Mars  orbit.  The  transit  phase  will  last  for  283  days.  During  this  phase,  the  MINERVA 
spacecraft  will  deploy  their  solar  panels  and  some  antennas,  and  perform  partial  system 
checkouts.  Mars  capture  will  take  place  on  May  29,  2008,  and  each  spacecraft  will 
assume its position in the MINERVA constellation. Finally, full system checkouts will be 
completed, enabling Initial Operating Capability (IOC) by July 9, 2008. 

3.2  On-Orbit Operations 
The MINERVA  constellation will  provide  coverage  for  all MSEs within  60°  latitude  of 
the Mars  equator,  for  at  least  five  years. Within 15° of  the  equator,  a  satellite will  come 
into  view  every  twenty  minutes  on  average,  and  it  will  remain  in  view  for  about  fifty 
minutes  per  pass.  As  long  as  at  least  one  satellite  is  in  view,  any  MSE  will  be  able  to 
send and receive communication data, and take positioning measurements. 

The  two  satellites  in  view  of  Earth  will  communicate  with  it  through  the  Deep  Space 
Network  (DSN).  Meanwhile,  all  four  satellites  will  be  able  to  communicate  with  Mars 
surface  explorers  and  with  each  other.  Any  satellites  not  in  view  of  Earth  can  relay 
communications  to Earth  by  cross-linking. To  perform  these  functions, MINERVA will 
operate  according  to  a  user  table,  which  lists  all  the  MSE  locations,  communication 
codes,  and  action  schedules. Thus  the  table  tells  each  satellite which MSEs  should be  in 
view  at  any  given  time,  how  to  contact  them,  and  whether  or  not  they  need 
communication  or  positioning  services.  Principal  Investigators  on  Earth  can  modify  the 
user table entries pertaining to their MSEs at any time. 

3.3 

Disposal 

As  each  MINERVA  satellite’s  on-orbit  operations  phase  is  concluded,  it  has  the 
capability  to  be  boosted  into  a  disposal  orbit  with  an  altitude  of  2150  km,  to  avoid 
cluttering the working orbit.

MINERVA Mission Requirements4 

4.1  Overview 

System  design  requires  substantial  consideration  of  both  program  and  performance 
requirements. The  objective  of  the  requirements  analysis  is  to  translate  user  needs  into  a 
quantifiable  set  of  performance  requirements  that  can  be  used  to  derive  design 
requirements. 

The  MINERVA  requirement  flow-down  portrays  a  logical  and  coherent  picture  of  the 
system’s functional architecture. 

The  requirement  hierarchy  was  developed  by  deriving  specific  requirements  from  both 
user needs and  the system design, and ordering  these requirements  in such a way  that  the 
entire  system  could  be  accepted  by  validation  and  verification  of  the  sub-elements.  The 
requirement flow down is shown in Error! Reference source not found.. 

The  MINERVA  system  is  composed  of  elements  orbiting  Mars,  elements  on  Mars,  and 
elements on Earth. The elements orbiting Mars can be separated into payload and bus.

4.2  Objectives 

The MINERVA mission is to provide an enabling infrastructure for Mars exploration. 

The  primary  mission  objective  is  to  provide  an  infrastructure  that  enables  data 
transmission  between  Earth  and  Mars  and  position  determination  for  Mars  surface 
explorers. 

Secondary  mission  objectives,  not  required  of  the  current  design,  are  to  provide  an 
observational  capability  to  permit  collection  of  weather  and  surface  detail  data  and  to 
expand the position determination capability to airborne and orbiting craft. 

4.3 

User Needs 

The following user needs statement has been developed from the mission statement of the 
MINERVA design team. 

“The  MINERVA  system  shall  provide  an  enabling  infrastructure  to 
support  the  exploration  of  Mars.  Specifically,  the  system  shall  provide 
Mars  Surface  Elements  (MSEs)  with  communication  services  between  the 
Mars  surface  and  Earth  Ground  Stations  (EGSs),  and  with  their  position 
on  the  surface of Mars, without  imposing additional design constraints on 
the MSEs.” 

4.4 

Specified Requirements 

Part of the challenge of creating meaningful requirements for the MINERVA system was 
the  small  number  of  specified  requirements.  Although  an  enabling  factor  in  exploring  a 
wide  trade  space,  it was  at  times  difficult  to derive  and write detailed  requirements  from 
the few requirements given. The minimum requirements as specified in the Program Plan 
are as follows: 

The  MINERVA  system  shall  provide  position  determination  solutions  to  100  m 
accuracy for users on the surface of Mars in the ±
 15° latitude band. 
The MINERVA  system  shall  provide  communication  relay  between  Earth  and Mars 
Surface Explorers (MSEs) in the ±15° latitude band that will allow the download of at 
least 10 Gb of data from the Mars surface per sol. 
The MINERVA system shall provide these services by 2010. 
The MINERVA system shall have a minimum design life of five years. 
The cost to IOC (initial operating capability) shall not exceed $300 Million.

The observation requirement is secondary. Since the primary requirement is to provide an 
enabling infrastructure for Mars and the Mars weather in general does not endanger Mars 
missions  [Sheehan],  it  has  been  decided  not  to  perform  observation.  Furthermore, 
observation is too expensive.

The  requirements  document  in  its  entirety  can  be  found  in  Appendix  A.  Included  in  the 
document  is  a  description  of  terminology  and  definitions  used,  as well  as  a  statement  of 
the assumptions made. The requirements and their intent are listed.

Character of Mars Missions5 

“This quest for life, this realization that we might not be alone in the universe, is a 
primary force driving our Mars missions” 

Dan Goldin 

Over  the  next  ten  years  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  and  its 
European  partners  plan  to  send  at  least  four  orbiters  and  four  landers  to  the  Martian 
surface,  culminating  in  a  mission  that  will  use  highly  sophisticated  rovers  to  collect 
samples of rock and soil that will be delivered to Earth by 2008. The agenda holds out the 
possibility  of  seven  or  so  additional  trips  to  the  Red  Planet,  including  several  relatively 
inexpensive  “micromissions”  and  a  second  series  of  flights  that  would  return  dozens 
more  samples  between  2008  and  2012.  This  ambitious  series  of  probes  is  in  addition  to 
the Mars Global Surveyor  spacecraft, which has been orbiting  the planet  since 1997, and 
a  Japanese  orbiter  called  Planet-B,  launched  in  1998  on  a  two-year  mission  to  study 
Mars’s atmosphere and ionosphere. 

The  upcoming Mars  missions  are  designed  to  pursue  a  couple  of  relatively  well  defined 
goals: expanding what  is known about Mars’s climate, geology and hydrology, both past 
and present, particularly  in relation to the question of whether life has ever existed on the 
planet, and laying the groundwork for future human exploration of the planet, possibly as 
soon as 2020. Robotic vehicles will  roam  several kilometers,  taking  scores of  samples as 
part of the most extensive search yet for signs that microbial life persists in the soil below 
the surface of the red world or that organic matter exists in its rocks or soil. 

Human  exploration  and  settlement  of  Mars  is  not  beyond  our  reach.  Indeed,  all  the 
technologies  needed  for  sending  humans  to  Mars  are  available  today.  The  first  piloted 
mission to Mars could reach the planet within a decade. 

5.1  MARSNET 

The Mars Network  (MARSNET)  is  a project being  studied by  Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
(JPL).  Its goals are to develop communication capability to provide a substantial increase 
in  data  rates  and  connectivity  from  Mars  to  Earth;  and  to  develop  an  in  situ  navigation 
capability  to  enable  more  precise  targeting  and  location  information  on  approach  to  and 
at  Mars.  The  mission  objective  is  to  support  Mars  global  reconnaissance,  surface 
exploration, sample return missions, robotic outposts, and eventual human exploration. 

JPL  enumerates  in  its  study  of  MARSNET  several  benefits  to  creating  a  Mars 
infrastructure. The availability of MARSNET will:

Mars exploration elements, 

Enhance connectivity and bandwidth for increased communication rate and/or contact

Improve targeting and location information (in situ navigation). 

In addition, by providing increased data rates and connectivity, MARSNET would enable 
greater  information  flow  to  the  public  for  the  purpose  of  engaging  them  in  the  Mars 
exploration  adventure.  In  essence,  MARSNET  would  be  building  a  publicly  accessible 
"gateway" to Mars. 

The  MARSNET  architecture  consists  of  a  constellation  of  microsatellites  and  one  or 
more  relatively  large Mars ariastationary  relay  satellites. The microsatellites are  intended 
to  serve both  as  communication  relays between Mars  exploration  elements  and  the Earth 
and  as  position  determination  aids  for  the  exploration  elements.  The  relay  satellites  are 
similar  to  very  high-bandwidth  geostationary  communication  satellites  currently  orbiting 
Earth. 

Communication  with  the  Mars  exploration  elements  would  occur  using  an  Internet 
protocol similar to that used by Earth's Internet.

A  possible  scenario  for  MARSNET  is  to  launch  a  first  microsatellite  in  2003  that  will 
orbit  Mars  around  its  equator.  Two  additional  microsatellites  would  be  launched  during 
the  subsequent  Martian  launch  windows,  one  of  these  having  a  polar  orbit.  In  this 
scenario,  MARSNET  would  have  in  situ  navigation-capabilities  with  a  three-satellite 
constellation  by  late  2005.  In  2007,  one  of  the  two  large  Mars  ariastationary  satellites 
would  be  launched.  A  fully  operational  six-satellite  constellation  in  this  scenario  would 
occur  in  late  2009.  Mars  Network  would  be  on  a  path  to  providing  “a  quantum  leap  in 
communication  capability  for  exploration  elements  planning  to  capture  near-continuous 
video.”

Figure 5.2: Artist's Conception of Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft 

The  Mars  Global  Surveyor  (MGS)  is  part  of  the  Mars  Surveyor  Program,  whose  main 
goal  is  to  explore  the  red  planet.  The  program  consists  of  orbiters  and  landers  to  be 
launched  at  every  launch  opportunity  between  1997  and  2006. The  1996  launch  to Mars 
included  the Mars Pathfinder and MGS. While Pathfinder’s mission has been completed, 
MGS continues to orbit the red planet. 

The  MGS  mission  objectives  are  threefold.  The  first  is  to  perform  scientific 
measurements.  The  second  is  to  provide  at  least  three  years  of  service  as  an  on-orbit 
communication  relay  for Mars  landers  and  atmospheric  vehicles.  The  third  is  to  support 
planning  for  future  Mars  missions  through  data  acquisition  with  special  emphasis  on 
those  measurements  that  could  influence  landing  site  selection.  Among  its  scientific 
objectives  are  to  build  comprehensive  data  sets  for  the  shape  and  composition  of  the 
planet’s surface, the structure of the atmosphere, and Mars’ magnetic properties.

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

Mars Global Surveyor is providing high resolution imaging of the Martian surface, which 
has revealed the following: 

  Clear evidence of previously flowing water 
  Ubiquitous dust and sand dunes 
  Water-ice clouds and dust storm observations 
Extremely smooth northern hemisphere suggests ancient ocean 
Intense magnetic stripes 
Some of the data collected for MGS will be invaluable to the creation of MINERVA. The 
Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) is bouncing infrared laser pulses off of the surface 
to  determine  range  of  the  MGS  spacecraft  to  the  Martian  surface.  The  range 
measurements  are  used  to  construct  a  precise  topographic  map  of  Mars  that  has  many 
applications to studies in geophysics, geology and atmospheric circulation. 

With  one  year  of  global  mapping  of  the  Mars  Global  Surveyor  mission  completed,  the 
MOLA  dataset  has  achieved  excellent  spatial  and  vertical  resolution.  Surface maps  have 
been  produced  from  the  altimetric  observations  collected  during  MOLA's  first  year  of 
global  mapping  and  provide  a  variety  of  regional  topographic  views  of  the  Martian 
surface.  The  best  spatial  resolution  (for  selected  sites)  is  approximately  1/16°  by  1/32° 
(where 1° on Mars is about 59 km) and the vertical accuracy is approximately 1 m. 

This data  set will be part of MINERVA’s position determination  system.  Information  on 
Martian atmosphere and weather patterns also proved helpful  in planning  the MINERVA 
mission. 

Aside  from  the  scientific  information  about  Mars  that  MGS  has  provided,  the  MGS 
mission  has  been  a  guide  in  designing  MINERVA.  MGS’s  second  mission  objective  is 
similar  to  one  of  MINERVA’s:  to  provide  support  for  future  landers  by  relaying  data 
from  the  Martian  surface  back  to  the  Earth.  While  MGS  is  only  one  satellite  and  not  a 
constellation, the mission provides a source of comparison. For example, MGS uses DSN 
to transmit its data back to Earth, much like the MINERVA constellation. 

Finally,  there  are  lessons  learned  from  the  MGS  mission  that  have  aided  in  the 
MINERVA design. MGS’s biggest problem was aerobraking. The aerobraking procedure 
had  to  be  suspended  because  air  pressure  from  the  atmosphere  caused  one  of  Surveyor's 
two solar panels to bend backward by a slight amount. It was determined that aerobraking 
is  still  feasible  but  at  a  gentler,  slower  pace  than  first  intended.  MGS’s  mishap 
highlighted  the  risk  involved  with  using  aerobraking.  In  order  to  avoid  high  risk, 
MINERVA elected to use an orbit insertion about Mars without the use of aerobraking.

orbit,  aerobraking  will  be  used  over  the  next  76  days  to  achieve  the  two-hour  science 
orbit. Aerobraking was used on the Mars Global Surveyor mission. The Orbiter will carry 
three  science  instruments:  the  Thermal  Emission  Imaging  System  (THEMIS),  the 
Gamma  Ray  Spectrometer  (GRS),  and  the  Mars  Radiation  Environment  Experiment 
(MARIE).  THEMIS  will  map  the  mineralogy  and  morphology  of  the  Martian  surface 
using  a  high-resolution  camera  and  a  thermal  infrared  imaging  spectrometer.  The  GRS 
will  achieve  global  mapping  of  the  elemental  composition  of  the  surface  and  determine 
the  abundance  of  hydrogen  in  the  shallow  subsurface.  The  GRS  is  a  rebuild  of  the 
instrument  lost with  the Mars Observer mission. The MARIE will characterize aspects of 
the  near-space  radiation  environment  as  related  to  the  radiation  risk  to  human  explorers. 
It  will  be  used  in  conjunction  with  a  similar  instrument  on  the  '03  Lander  to  determine 
and model the effects of the atmosphere on the radiation-induced hazard on the surface. 

Launch  of  the  Mars  Surveyor  2003  lander,  if  approved,  would  occur  between  May  27, 
2003  and  June  16,  2003.  The  2003  Lander  will  carry  an  imager  to  take  pictures  of  the 
surrounding  terrain during  its rocket-assisted descent  to  the surface. The descent  imaging 
camera  will  provide  images  of  the  landing  site  for  geologic  analyses,  and  will  aid 
planning  for  initial operations and  traverses by  the  rover. The 2003 Lander will also be a 
platform  for  instruments  and  technology  experiments designed  to provide key  insights  to 
decisions  regarding  successful  and  cost-effective  human missions  to Mars. Hardware  on 
the  Lander will  be  used  for  an  in-situ  demonstration  test  of  rocket  propellant  production 
using  gases  in  the  Martian  atmosphere.  Other  equipment  will  characterize  the  Martian 
soil properties and surface radiation environment.

Design Concept 

The  design  of  the  MINERVA  systems  was  derived  through  several  down-selection 
iterations.  The  first  down-selection  eliminated  families  of  architectures  that  could  not 
meet  the  minimum  mission  requirements.  The  next  down-selection  eliminated  those 
aspects  of  the  chosen  orbital  architectures  that  did  not  improve  the  cost-per-function  of 
the mission. The  final  round  involved  integrated  concurrent  engineering, where  the  trade 
space  of  the  driving  parameters  associated with  the  payload  performance were  explored. 
The following sections detail the design process as it evolved during the project. 

6.1 

Architectural Design Trades7 

During  the  Trade  Analysis  and  Requirements  Review  (TARR)  phase  of  the  project, 
several different architectures that could meet the requirements were suggested. 

The candidate architectures were grouped into three families, namely Mars ground-based, 
Earth based, and Mars orbiting. 

Preliminary  investigations  of  each  architecture  family  were  conducted  to  establish  their 
relative  suitability.  The  most  promising  family  of  architectures,  the  Mars  orbiting 
architecture,  was  selected  for  more  detailed  design  work  including  trades  such  as  those 
related to satellite size versus orbit, and laser versus radio communication. 

More detailed analyses were performed to define a single system from which the detailed 
design of the specific elements could be rendered. 

6.1.1  Description of Criteria Used in Architecture Down-selection 

The  three  architecture  families  were  evaluated  based  on  their  ability  to  meet  the 
performance and cost requirements as well as their performance relative to the R3 criteria: 

Communication 

  What is the best data rate that can be achieved? (Gb/sol) 
  What is the maximum size of the coverage area? (° Latitude) 
  What are the availability characteristics of the system? (%) 
 

Position Determination 

  What is the best possible resolution, both surface and vertical? (m) 
User specification is 100 m accuracy for MSEs.

  Reliability:  How  reliable  is  the  system  (as  a  whole)  in  performing  its  primary

  Robustness: Is the system able to adjust to and perform in a dynamic environment? 
 
The following factors were also taken into account when comparing architecture families: 

  What potential does MINERVA have to perform Mars observation? 
Expandability:  Is  the  system  able  to  support  a  wide  range  of  potential  missions 
beyond its initial mission design? 

 

6.1.2  Mars Surface-Based Architectures 

Several  possible  Mars 
for  position  determination  and 
surface  architectures 
communication were examined, based on Earth-like counterparts. The  following  sections 
describe these options [Hobbs, 1990]. 

6.1.2.1 

Loran-C Based Navigation System 

The  Loran-C  system  relies  on  the  propagation  of  ground  waves.  It  broadcasts  a  pulsed 
waveform  at  a  frequency  between  90  and  100  kHz  with  a  transmission  power  on  the 
order of 1500 kW. 

The  baseline  between  stations  is  1600  to  2400  km  with  an  accuracy  of  200  to  600 m. 
Differential techniques can be used to increase the accuracy (see below). 

Assuming  that ground waves on Mars propagate as  they do on Earth, and with a baseline 
of  2000  km  between  stations,  a  Mars  Loran  system  would  require  eleven  stations  along 

36

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

the  equator. This  chain would  provide  navigation  to  latitudes  up  to  30°, with  the  highest 
accuracy at the equator (~200 m) and the lowest accuracy at 30o latitude (~600 m). 

While  it  is  technically  feasible  to  build  a  Loran-C  based  navigation  system  on Mars,  the 
associated  risks  and  costs  are  high.  For  example,  a  Mars-based  Loran  system  would 
require a self-deploying antenna structure, as well as a large source of electric power such 
as a solar array farm or nuclear power. 

6.1.2.2  Omega Based Navigation System 

The  Omega  system  uses  a  Very  Low  Frequency  (VLF)  between  10  to  14  kHz  at  a 
transmit  power  on  the  order  of  10  kW.  On  Earth,  the  surface  and  the  bottom  of  the 
ionosphere act as a waveguide to carry the waves long distances over the horizon. 

The  baseline  between  stations  is  8000  to  9600  km  with  an  accuracy  of  1.6  to  3.2  km. 
Differential techniques can be used to increase the accuracy (see below). 

Assuming  that  the  ionosphere  and  surface  on Mars  propagate  VLF  waves  as  they  do  on 
Earth,  five  stations  could  provide  global  position  determination  for  Mars  with  an 
accuracy  of  1  to  2  km.  Two  of  the  stations  could  be  at  the  poles, with  3  stations  equally 
spaced  along  the  equator.  The  range  from  the  pole  stations  to  the  equator  would  be 
5300 km, while the distance between equatorial stations would be 7100 km. 

Although  it  is  technically  feasible  to build  an Omega based  system on Mars,  it would be 
very  risky  and  cost  prohibitive.  The  antenna  structure  of  an  Omega  system  is  highly 
complex  and  requires  an  antenna  roughly  400  m  in  diameter.  Furthermore,  the  system 
would require an accurate model of the Martian ionosphere; none is available at this time. 
The  risks  and  costs  associated  with  this  system  are  similar  to  those  for  the  Loran  type 
system. 

6.1.2.3 

Differential Radio Navigation Techniques 

In  this method,  a  reference  receiver  is  placed  at  an  accurately  known  position. Then,  the 
reference position given by  the navigation system  is compared  to  the actual position. The 
difference  between  the  actual  position  and  the  measured  position  is  then  broadcast  as  a 
correction. This method  can produce  accuracies on  the order of 1  to 2 m.  It  is  limited by 
how  far  the  correction  data  can  be  broadcast,  and  by  how  accurately  the  reference 
position is known. 

Differential  techniques  are  complementary  to  an  existing  navigation  system  and  require 
the installation of ground references. The position of the ground references would have to 
be  determined  using DSN, which  has  an  accuracy  on  the  order  of  100  km  for  objects  on 
the surface of Mars. 

Therefore  differential  techniques  cannot  be  used  for  the  primary  position  determination 
system.

6.1.2.4 

Communication Array 

The  primary  problem  with  ground-based  communication  systems  is  the  coverage. 
Without  communication  relay  satellites,  future  missions  would  have  to  be  deployed 
within  line-of-sight  of  a  Mars-to-Earth  communication  antenna.  To  meet  the  coverage 
requirements, a large number of ground-based antennas would be required. 

A ground-based communication system could meet the data rate requirements, but a large 
number of ground stations would be necessary to meet the coverage requirements. 

6.1.2.5 

Location of Mars Ground Stations 

The  following  figure  describes  the  layout  of  some  potential Mars  ground-based  position 
determination  and  communication  systems.  For  the  Loran-C  type  navigation  system, 
eleven  ground  stations  are  needed.  For  the  Omega-type  navigation  system,  five  stations 
are  needed.  These  stations  are  equidistantly  spaced  around  the  equator,  and  at  the  poles 
for total coverage.

For  communication,  it  is  possible  to  build  large  antennas  to  receive  and  transmit  high 
power  signals  between  Earth  and  Mars.  The  key  issue  is  how  to  get  MSE  data  to  and 
from  the  stations. While  it may  be  possible  to  transmit  low  data  rate  commands  through 
the  navigation  beacons  to  an  MSE,  it  would  be  difficult  for  a  power  and  mass  limited 
MSE  to  transmit  a  high  data  rate  stream  through  the  navigation  beacons  to  a  transmitter 
station. This means  that  a  large number of  communication  relays would be  required. Six 
line-of-sight  communication  beacons  could  be  located  at  the  tops  of  the  high  volcanoes 
listed in Table 6.1.

At a height of 10 km, the line-of-sight range is 260 km. At a height of 27 km, the line-of-
sight  range  is  426  km. While  ground waves  could  extend  to  this  range  over  the  horizon, 
the  real  issue  is  with  the  transmit  range  of  an  MSE.  It  would  require  over  fifty  27-km 
high ground stations to cover just the equator with line-of-sight coverage. 

6.1.3  Earth-Based Architectures 

The  second  family  of  architectures  involves  Earth-based  systems  only.  The  primary 
system  we  would  expect  to  use  is  the  Deep  Space  Network  (DSN),  an  international 
network of antennas used to support space missions and astronomy. 

The  DSN  is  managed  by  the  Telecommunication  and  Missions  Operations  Directorate 
(TMOD)  of  NASA’s  Jet  Propulsion  Laboratory  (JPL).  It  is  used  to  provide  two-way 
communication  links  for  space  mission  guidance,  control,  and  data  reception.  On  recent 
Mars missions,  lander  targeting  accuracies  of  500  km  (at  77°  S  latitude)  and  100  km  (at 
15° S latitude) were achieved with DSN support. 

39 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

DSN  complexes  are  located  at  three main  locations: Canberra, Australia; Madrid,  Spain; 
and Goldstone,  CA, USA.  Each  complex  is  equipped with  70 m,  34 m,  26 m,  and  11 m 
antennas.  The  70  m  antennas  have  400  kW  transmitters.  DSN  systems  use  long  wave 
radio, short wave radio, and microwave frequencies. Most deep space mission operations 
use X-band microwave frequencies (8 to 12.5 GHz). 

Pictured  in  Figure  6.2  are  the  ground-based  Very  Large  Array  in  New  Mexico,  and  a 
conceptual  representation  of  a  space-based  very  large  baseline  interferometer  (SVLBI). 
The  Japanese  VLBI  Space  Observatory  Program  (VSOP)  is  an  example  of  an  SVLBI 
already  in  orbit.  The  US  plans  to  launch  the  Advanced  Radio  Interferometry  between 
Space  and Earth  (ARISE) mission  in  2008,  in which  an  orbiting  25 m  inflatable  antenna 
will enable an angular resolution of about ten micro-arcseconds. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 6.2: Possible Earth-Based Systems 

The  analysis  performed  on  this  Earth-based  architecture  was  broken  down  into 
communication and position determination. 

A  communication  system  using  only DSN, without  an  intermediate  relay, would  require 
high-power MSE  communication  subsystems.  This  implies  that MSEs would  have  to  be 
larger, more complex and therefore more costly. 

For  position  determination,  angular  resolution  calculations were  performed  assuming X-
band  frequencies  for  DSN  and  existing  ground  VLBI.  The  angular  resolutions  for  the 
70 m DSN  antenna  and  an  8600 km ground VLBI  array were  found  to be  approximately 
125  and  0.8  arcseconds,  respectively.  For  space-based  VLBI,  the  slightly  shorter 
wavelength  ARISE  target  specifications  were  used,  resulting  in  an  angular  resolution  of 
1e-5  arcseconds. The  latter  angular  resolution  corresponds  to  surface  resolution  on Mars 
over 100 m. This does not meet the system requirements. 

40 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

Therefore  an  existing  Earth-end  architecture  could  not  be  used  to  meet  the  position 
determination requirements. 

6.1.4  Mars Orbiting Architecture 

The  third  architecture  family  consists  of  systems  containing  at  least  one  Mars-orbiting 
satellite.  The  use  of  additional  assets  to  augment  the  capability  of  the  single  Mars-
orbiting satellite was left as a design element subject to trade. 

In an attempt  to bound  the problem,  the  following  three variables with significant  impact 
on the overall constellation design were identified: 

  Altitude 
The  altitude  of  most  Mars  constellations  would  fall  somewhere  between  a  low 
800 km orbit and the ariastationary orbit at 17,030 km. 
  Number of satellites 
  Number of orbital planes 
 
Preliminary  analysis  showed  the  clear  superiority  of  this  architecture  family  over  the 
other families. The detailed analysis is exposed in the rest of this document. 

6.1.5  Architectural Down-Selection 

A  discrimination  matrix  was  used  to  identify  the  best  candidate  architecture.  The 
traditional stoplight approach was used  to classify  the ability of each architecture  to meet 
or exceed the design specifications: 

  Red indicates that the architecture does not meet the required specification 
  Yellow  indicates  that  the  architecture meets  the  specification  but  presents  significant 
challenges 
  Green  indicates  that  the  architecture  meets  or  exceeds  the  specification  with 
acceptable difficulties 

 
Figure  6.3  shows  the  matrix  for  all  three  architectures,  as  described  in  the  preceding 
sections.

Results  of  the  analysis  showed  that  the  Mars  Ground  Based  and  the  Earth  Based 
architectures  were  not  able  to  meet  the  required  system  specifications.  Thus,  both  were 
eliminated from the trade space. 

The Mars  orbit  based  architecture  family was  able  to meet  all  the  requirements  and was 
accordingly selected. 

6.2 

Further Down-Selection8 

Several  areas  considered  in  the  original  trade  space  were  subsequently  eliminated.  This 
section briefly describes the elimination process. 

For  example,  there  are  significant  advantages  to  using  a  laser  communication  system, 
including  reduction  of  size,  mass  and  power,  and  increased  data  rates.  However,  the 
primary disadvantage of optical communication links is the need for precision pointing of 
the optical beam. Stringent pointing requirements  increase  the complexity and cost of  the 
attitude  determination  and  control  system  (ADCS)  and  onboard  computing  systems. 
Consequently, laser communication was not considered.

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

Another  option  was  to  use  the  Martian  moons  as  a  communication  relay  base.  The 
advantage of using a Martian moon is the ability to station a relatively large relay antenna 
on  the  surface.  An  interesting  property  of  the  Martian  moons  is  that  the  orbital  period 
equals  the  rotational  period  for  both  moons,  which  means  that  one  side  of  the  moon  is 
constantly  in view of  the Mars  surface. However,  the  risks  and  costs associated with  this 
type of design were prohibitive. 

Two Lagrange points,  one  between Mars  and  the Sun,  and  the other on  the opposite  side 
of  Mars,  located  approximately  1,000,000  km  from  Mars,  were  considered  as  locations 
for  communication  relays.  However,  existing  antenna  technology  proved  capable  of 
communicating  with  the  Earth  without  the  need  for  additional  satellites  at  the  Lagrange 
points. 

Finally,  using  atmospheric  vehicles,  such  as  balloons,  dirigibles,  and  airplanes  on  Mars 
could  provide  added  benefits.  However,  the  risk  associated  with  using  those  objects,  as 
well as  the positional uncertainty due  to atmospheric  effects  rendering  them  incapable of 
meeting the position determination requirement eliminates this as a possible option. 

Therefore,  the remaining  trade space contains satellites of variable number, size, altitude, 
phase, and inclination. These variables were altered to explore the remaining trade space. 

6.3 

Final Top-Level Design Trades: an Overview9 

This  section  summarizes  the  initial design process  from mission  requirements  to  the  top-
level  design  trades  that  led  to  the  choice  of  number  of  satellites,  altitude  and  orbital 
inclination. Further details can be found in the subsequent sections. 

To  minimize  development  and  infrastructure  costs,  we  decided  to  use  DSN  as  a 
communication link with the Earth. 

A DSN pass is defined as a ten-hour continuous period during which DSN is available for 
tracking,  commanding,  telemetry  and  data  return.  DSN  currently  provides  Mars  Global 
Surveyor  with  one  such  pass  per  day.  One  DSN  pass  per  day  is  also  assumed  to  be 
available for MINERVA. 

Implementing  a near  real-time communication  link with MSEs enhances  the value of  the 
MINERVA  system.  Opportunities  for  near  real-time  communication  occur  during  each 
DSN  pass.  Implementing  satellite  cross-links  ensures  maximum  use  of  near  real-time 
opportunities.  Satellite  cross-links  also  increase  the  failure  tolerance  of  the  system  (see 
section  10.1)  and  the  accuracy  of  orbit  determination  (see  section  10.2).  We  therefore 
decided to implement satellite cross-links. 

On the basis of the above decisions, the top-level requirements were separated into a cost 
constraint,  three  types  of  communication  links  (MINERVA-Earth,  cross-links,  and

MINERVA-Mars), and  the position determination requirement. For each  type of  link,  the 
parameters  possibly  affecting  performance  and  cost  are  frequency,  data  rate,  bit  error 
rate, antenna gain and RF output power. 

1.  Cost constraint 

The  first  main  requirement  is  a  cost  constraint,  specifying  that  the  mission  cost  to 
initial operating capability (IOC) should not exceed $300M. 

2.  MINERVA-Earth link 

To avoid  single point  failures  in  the  system, more  than one MINERVA  satellite must 
have  the capability  to communicate with  the Earth. Since  the cost constraint does not 
allow MINERVA to afford more than a few satellites, it was decided that all satellites 
would have an Earth link. 

The  Earth-link  antenna  power-aperture  product  is  the  dominating  factor  for  payload 
cost and mass. 

The  possible  frequencies  for  this  link  are  limited  to  those  with  which  DSN  can 
interface.  The  top-level  requirement  sets  the  total  data  transfer  from  all MSEs  to  the 
Earth  to  at  least  10  Gb/sol,  whatever  the  Earth-Mars  distance.  This  requirement  and 
the  choice  to  use  one  DSN  pass  per  day  sets  the  minimum  total  effective  data  rate 
from MINERVA to Earth (see 10.1). 

Data  from  the  Earth  to  Mars,  be  it  for MINERVA  or  for MSEs,  can  be  divided  into 
two main types. The first is command type data, which is typically small, but requires 
high  accuracy  and  minimum  delivery  delay.  The  second  is  mission  reconfiguration 
data,  which  is  larger,  also  requires  high  accuracy,  but  for  which  longer  delivery 
delays are acceptable. The uplink from the Earth to Mars therefore requires a low data 
rate and BER and is not a limiting factor for the MINERVA-Earth link design. 

The constellation altitude and inclination have no effect on the required Earth antenna 
gain. 

Therefore  the  only  parameter  affecting  this  link  is  the  number  of  satellites.  The 
required  antenna  power-aperture  product  decreases  as  the  number  of  satellites 
increases,  because  the  total  data  return  rate  is  split  among  several  satellites  among 
those that simultaneously see the Earth. 

3.  Cross-links 
 

The data rate for the cross-links is also driven by the requirement on data return to the 
Earth.  In  the  worst  case,  all  MSEs  communicate  with  MINERVA  through  a  single 
satellite on the dark side of Mars. Since a main factor in implementing the cross-links 
was to provide near real-time communication, the availability requirement on this link 
is high. This ensures that 90% of near real-time opportunities can be made use of. 

44 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

The  antenna  aperture-power  product  for  this  link  is  determined  according  to  the 
maximum  distance  between  two  satellites,  which  is  a  function  of  the  number  of 
satellites and  their altitude. However,  the variations  in size and cost of cross-links are 
small with respect to the other two links. 

The  main  influence  of  cross-links  in  the  top-level  design  trades  was  therefore  to  set 
the minimum altitude for a given number of satellites. 

4.  MINERVA-Mars link 

The top-level coverage requirement is that each MSE in the ±15° latitude band should 
see  a  satellite  with  a  maximum  of  three  hours  revisit  time,  and  50%  availability. 
Availability  is  defined  as  the  total  time  in  view  per  sol  and  is  the  limiting  factor  in 
this case (see 6.5). 

The  number  of  satellites,  altitude  and  orbital  inclination  are  all  main  drivers  for 
meeting  the  coverage  requirements.  Increasing  the  altitude  or  decreasing  the 
inclination decreases the minimum number of satellites for the required coverage (see 
6.5).  Thus,  the  coverage  requirement  sets  the  relation  between  orbital  altitude  and 
inclination and minimum number of satellites. 

The  MINERVA-Mars  link  design  makes  minimum  assumptions  about  MINERVA 
users. Firstly, most MSEs should carry omni-directional antennas at UHF, with an RF 
output  power  on  the  order  of  10 W.  Secondly,  building  a  whole  constellation  would 
not be worthwhile if less than two such MSEs where present on Mars. 

Given  the  small  gain  of  the  user’s  antenna,  the  limiting  factor  for  the  MINERVA-
MSE  link  is  the  uplink  from MSEs.  The  requirement  for  10  Gb/sol  of  data  return  to 
the  Earth  places  a  lower  bound  on  the  total  data  rate  from  all  MSEs  to  MINERVA. 
The  type  of  data  being  transmitted  (mostly  scientific  data)  sets  the  required  bit  error 
rate. 

The  orbital  altitude  sets  the  minimum  receiving  antenna  gain  to  meet  these  data  rate 
and  BER  requirements.  The  gain  affects  the  antenna  size  and  therefore  its  cost.  (see 
10.1). 

As  the  antenna  gain  increases,  the  antenna  half-power  beamwidth  decreases.  When 
the  beamwidth  becomes  smaller  than  the  planet’s  angular  diameter,  the  coverage 
performance decreases. 

5.  Position Determination 

The top-level position determination requirement is to gather sufficient information to 
determine  the position of MSEs  in  the ±15°  latitude band with  an  accuracy  of 100 m 
(1σ ). 

The  position  determination  requirements  are  more  easily  met  using  distinct  inclined 
orbital  planes.  Placing  satellites  into  distinct  planes  at  Mars  is  no  more  costly  or 

45 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

technically  difficult  than  placing  satellites  into  the  same  plane. MINERVA  satellites 
will  therefore  be  into  distinct  inclined  orbits.To minimize  payload  requirements,  it  is 
desirable  to  use  the  communication  hardware  for  positioning.  Therefore  active 
position  determination  using  RF  signals  is  preferable.  MINERVA  will  use  the 
existing  two-way  communication  link  between  satellites  and  MSEs  for  positioning 
(see 10.2). 

The  decision  to  perform  positioning  using  both  two-way  ranging  and  Doppler  shift 
measurement makes positioning performance largely independent of altitude. 

The  only  parameter  directly  affecting  position  determination  is  orbital  inclination. 
Positioning accuracy requirements are more easily met at higher inclinations.  

Positioning  performance  is  also  indirectly  linked  to  altitude  and  number  of  satellites 
through coverage performance, since increasing the time in view of an MSE increases 
the number of measurements. 

These trades are summarized in Table 6.2. The table indicates the relations between three 
main  top-level  design  parameters  and  the  main  requirements.  References  indicate  the 
section of the report that describes each relation in more details. 

This trade process resulted in the choice of four satellites in two orbital planes at 2000 km 
altitude and 27° inclination.

Interplanetary Transfer Trades10 

One  of  the  major  system-level  trades  for  the MINERVA  constellation  was  the  selection 
of  a  low-thrust  electric  versus  chemical  propulsion  system.  In  order  to  explore  this  trade 
fully,  the  orbit  group  examined  the  interplanetary  transfer  profile  for  both  methods  to 
provide the bus group with an accurate assessment of the cumulative required  ∆ V. During 
early  design  iterations,  electric  propulsion  appeared  the  most  promising,  so  we  selected 
that approach for our initial analysis. 

Several  aspects  of  the  low-thrust  transfer  method  make  a  thorough  trajectory  analysis 
considerably  involved.  To  begin  with,  the  near-continuous  use  of  the  electric  thruster 
adds  an  external  force  term  to  the  governing  equation of motion. Third-  and  fourth-body 
effects  from  the  planets’ moons  and  the  Sun  are  significant  in  several  operating  regimes 
during  the  transfer  and  cannot  be  neglected,  as  in  traditional  Keplerian  orbit  equations. 
Point-mass  approximations  are  not  valid  for  the  planets,  particularly  since  the  spiraling 
trajectory common to low-thrust systems is sensitive to variations in the gravity field. The 
net  result  is  a  set  of  coupled,  non-linear  differential  equations  with  boundary  value 
conditions  for  each  regime  of  the  transfer  orbit.  In  [Stuhlinger,  1964],  Ernst  Stuhlinger 
describes the various operating regimes: 

“A  trajectory  to  Mars…will  consist  of  the  following  phases:  (1)  spiral  around  the  earth 
with  tangential  thrust  until  escape  is  achieved;  (2)  segment  of  an  opening  spiral  around 
the  sun  with  tangential  thrust  until  the  predetermined  turnaround  point  is  reached;  (3) 
segment  of  a  closing,  but  still  outbound,  spiral  around  the  sun  with  reversed  thrust  until 
the  orbit  of Mars  is  reached;  (4) motion  on  the Martian  solar  orbit, with  the  thrust  vector 
turned  either  from  forward  to  radially  inward,  or  from  reverse  to  radially  outward,  to 
obtain  superorbital or  suborbital velocity,  in order  to approach Mars  in  its  solar orbit;  (5) 
appropriate  direction  of  thrust  to  effect  the  capture  of  the  vehicle  into  an  orbit  around 
Mars;  and  (6)  spiral  around  Mars  with  reverse  tangential  thrust  until  the  desire  orbit 
around Mars is reached.” 

The  orbit  group  performed  a  preliminary  analysis  using  several  simplifying  assumptions 
to  obtain  analytical  approximations  for  the  electric  propulsion  case.  The  group  later 
expanded  the analysis by performing stepwise  integration on slightly  improved modeling 
equations  to  obtain  a  numerical  solution  to  the  same  problem.  Due  to  the  level  of 
uncertainty  in  the  preliminary  analyses,  however,  the  capture  trajectory  around  Mars 
became a significant risk issue for the program. 

Fortunately,  the  orbit  group  obtained  a  copy  of  two  software  packages  used  by  NASA 
mission  planners  to  simulate  the  trajectory  of  interplanetary  missions  using  low-thrust 
electric propulsion. The  first  software package, ChebyTOP, was developed by Boeing  in 
the  early  1970s  under  a  contract  from  NASA  Ames,  and  maintained  by  the  NASA  Jet 
Propulsion  Lab  since  its  release.  ChebyTOP  performs  moderately  detailed  trajectory 
analysis  for  interplanetary  missions.  The  second  software  package,  SEPSPOT,  was 
developed  by  MIT  Lincoln  Labs  in  the  mid-1970s  under  a  contract  from  NASA  Glenn

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

Research  Center,  and  also  maintained  by  the  NASA  Jet  Propulsion  Lab.  SEPSPOT 
calculates minimum trip time for a trajectory from one closed conic to another.  
Table  6.3  summarizes  the  results  of  the  low-thrust  trajectory  analysis.  The  total  ∆ V 
required  for  the  electric  propulsion method  is  15.67  km/s,  and  the  total  transit  time  from 
Earth  departure  to Mars  capture  is  894  days.  These  values  are  computed  using  an  Earth 
parking orbit of 185 km. Most  low-thrust missions  typically rely on  the  launch vehicle  to 
boost  into  a  much  higher  parking  orbit,  thereby  minimizing  the  amount  of  time  the 
spacecraft  has  to  spend working  its way  from Earth. The  departure  trajectory  is  depicted 
in Figure 6.4, while Figure 6.5 shows the heliocentric interplanetary trajectory. Figure 6.6 
completes the electric propulsion profile with the final capture trajectory around Mars.

In addition to electric propulsion, the orbit group examined chemical propulsion methods. 
Once  again,  the  group  used  several  simplifying  assumptions  to  perform  a  preliminary 

50 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

analysis. In this case, the interplanetary transfer was modeled as a patched-conic problem 
with  a  simple  Hohmann  transfer  orbit  between  Earth  and  Mars.  Although  this  approach 
resulted in a fairly accurate assessment of the total  ∆ V required for the transfer, it did not 
take  into  consideration  the  plane  change  performed  by  the  launch  vehicle  prior  to 
achieving  parking  orbit,  the  use  of  the  launch  vehicle  second  stage  for  the  initial 
departure burn, or  the correction burns performed on  the  transit phase between Earth and 
Mars. 

The  second  iteration  of  the  chemical  propulsion  analysis  took  these  considerations  into 
account.  In  addition,  the  code  calculated  the  ∆ V  required  to  boost  each  satellite  into  the 
Martian  atmosphere  and,  as  an  alternative,  to  raise  each  satellite  into  a  higher  disposal 
orbit.  Table  6.3  summarizes  the  results  from  the  second  analysis  for  the  final  system 
design.  The  total  ∆ V  required  for  the  chemical  propulsion  method  is  5.57  km/s,  and  the 
total  transit  time  from  Earth  departure  to  Mars  capture  is  286  days.  The  earth  departure 
trajectory is depicted in Figure 6.7, the heliocentric interplanetary trajectory in Figure 6.8, 
and the final capture trajectory around Mars in Figure 6.9.

Having  completed  the  individual  case  analysis  for  both  electric  and  chemical  propulsion 
methods,  the  orbit  group  provided  the  results  to  the  bus  group  and  launch  group  for 
consideration  in  their  associated  trades.  Strictly  from  an  orbit  standpoint,  chemical 
propulsion  not  only  requires  less  overall  ∆ V,  but  also  takes  less  transit  time  to  complete 
and  is  therefore  the  best  candidate  of  the  two  methods.  Given  the  mission  operations 
concept  –  in  particular,  the  use  of  the  launch  vehicle  for  a  significant  portion  of  the 
transfer  ∆ V  –  the  integration  group  selected  chemical  propulsion  for  the  MINERVA 
system design. 

6.5 

Constellation Design11 

The  purpose  of  the  MINERVA  system  is  to  provide  communication  and  positioning 
information  to  the  Martian  surface.  More  specifically,  the  system  will  be  focusing  on 
surface elements that lie between 15 °N and 15°S. The satellite constellation was designed 
so that it maximized the performance within this latitude band. 

The  first  step  in  designing  the  satellite  constellation  was  creating  a  set  of  trade  spaces. 
These  trade  spaces  were  governed  by  the  requirements  set  forth  in  the  requirements 
document and from the constraints placed on the system by the actual architectural design 
of  the  MINERVA  system.  Then  the  trade  spaces  were  combined  and  a  set  of  feasible 
designs  was  developed.  From  these  designs,  a  single  constellation  was  chosen  so  that  it 
maximized  the  performance  of  the  system within  the  latitude  band  of  coverage, while  at 
the same time minimizing the overall cost of the system.

Figure 6.10: Coverage Trade Space 

6.5.1  Constellation Design Trade Space 

6.5.1.1 

Availability and Revisit Time 

Two  separate  requirements  placed  on  the  MINERVA  system  affect  the  coverage  of  the 
satellite  constellation. Firstly,  a  satellite  shall be  available  to  an MSE  at  least 50% of  the 
time, and secondly, the time between satellite passes shall not exceed three hours. 

Using  these  two  constraints,  a  separate  trade  space  was  created  for  each  type  of 
constellation.  

For  example,  constellations  with  a  different  number  of  orbital  planes,  or  phasing  angles 
have their own trade space.  

In  each  trade  space  the minimum number of  satellites needed  to  satisfy  the  requirements 
was calculated for different inclinations and altitudes. 

The coverage trade spaces were then combined and the resulting composite trade space is 
shown  in Figure 6.10. From  the plot we  can  see  that  as  altitude  increases,  the number of 
satellites  decreases.  This  follows  from  the  fact  that  as  the  satellites  increase  in  altitude, 
the  size  of  their  footprint  also  increases.  The  number  of  satellites  also  increases  as  the 

54 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

inclination  increases.  This  is  because  as  the  inclination  increases,  the  satellites  are 
directly above the ±15 ° latitude band for a smaller percentage of the orbital period. 

Figure 6.11: Minimum Altitude for Inter-Satellite Links 

6.5.1.2 

Inter-Satellite Links 

Each  satellite  has  the  ability  to  communicate  with  the  other  satellites  in  orbit  via  inter-
satellite links. In order for these links to work, the satellites require line of sight visibility. 
This  constraint  imposes  a  minimum  altitude  on  the  satellite  constellation.  Figure  6.11 
shows  the approximate minimum altitude necessary  for  line of sight communication. The 
figure  assumes  that  the  satellites  are  evenly  spaced  around  the  planet  in  circular  orbits. 
Also included in the figure is the requirement that the communication links must pass 200 
km  above  the  surface. This  additional  requirement provides  a margin of  safety  that  takes 
into account the atmospheric effects and orbit insertion errors. 

6.5.1.3 

Position Determination Constraint 

As  described  in  section  10.2  the  satellites  need  to  be  in  an  inclined  orbital  plane  relative 
to  the equator. This  inclination allows  the MINERVA  system  to calculate  the position of 
an MSE with  greater  accuracy  and  in  less  time. The  required  inclination  is  25°-30 ° with 
higher inclinations preferred.

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

6.5.2  Final Constellation Design 

The  above  trade  spaces  placed  restrictions  on  the  constellation  design.  After  they  had 
been combined, they produced a set of constellations that were feasible. From this set, the 
final design was chosen. 

The  parameters  that  were  varied  include,  number  of  satellites,  inclination,  and  altitude. 
The first parameter that was chosen was the number of satellites. From the ICE sessions it 
was  confirmed  that  four  satellites  is  the  maximum  number  of  satellites  that  could  be 
afforded.  The  decision  to  use  four  satellites  was  based  mainly  on  the  altitude  restriction 
placed  on  the  constellation  by  the  inter-satellite  links. Having  four  satellites  allow  as  the 
constellation to orbit at a much lower altitude than three satellites. (1700 km compared to 
3700  km).  At  3700  km,  the  antenna  needed  to  communicate  to  the  surface  would  be 
much larger than necessary. 

 

Figure 6.12: Final Constellation 

Once four satellites had been chosen, the altitude and the inclination were determined. An 
increase  in  altitude  increases  the  coverage  area,  but  at  the  same  time  increases  the 
antenna  size.  A  decrease  in  inclination  also  increases  the  coverage  within  the  latitude 
band,  but  at  the  same  time  decreases  the  performance  of  the  position  determination 
system. From  these  two  trades,  the  final altitude was chosen  to be 2000 km. This altitude 
corresponds  to  the  altitude  where  the  beamwidth  of  the  antenna  allows  users  to 
communicate with the satellite as long as the satellite is 10° above the horizon (see Figure 
6.12). 

56 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

Once  the altitude had been set at 2000 km,  the  inclination was set so  that  the satellite can 
communicate  with  any  MSE  in  the  ±15 °   latitude  band  during  every  orbital  period.  The 
required  inclination  is  27°.  This  can  be  seen  graphically  in  Figure  6.12.  Generated  in 
MATLAB,  the  figure  shows  the  satellites  in  their  final  constellation  around  Mars.  The 
yellow  cones  represent  the  areas  covered  by  each  individual  satellite.  The  green  lines 
represent  the ±15 °  latitude band.  In  the  figure, one of  the  satellites  is  at  the highest point 
(with respect to the equator) in its orbit.  

The final design  is a Walker-Delta pattern, which consists of four satellites  in  two orbital 
planes. The  satellites are  in circular orbits with an altitude of 2000 km and an  inclination 
of 27°. 

6.5.3  Constellation Statistics 

Once  the  constellation  had  been  determined,  the  statistics  of  the  constellation  were 
determined.  These  statistics  were  used  to  evaluate  different  point  designs.  The  payload 
group used this information to determine the communication abilities of the system.  

Figure 6.13: Availability Contours 

Shown  on  Figure  6.13,  Figure  6.14  and  Figure  6.15  are  the  results  of  the  statistical 
analysis of the final constellation. Figure 6.13 is a contour plot showing the percentage of 
time  that  a  satellite  is  in view. Around  the  equator,  a  satellite  is  in  view  for  at  least  80% 
of  the  time,  and  at  15 ° N  and  15°
  S,  the  satellite  is  in  view  70%  of  the  time. Above  65 °  
the satellites are never in view.

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

Figure 6.14: Contours of Maximum Revisit Time 

Figure 6.14 shows the maximum time in minutes that a satellite will not be in view. Near 
the  equator,  this  is  less  than  20  minutes,  and  less  than  30  minutes  at  the  ±15 °  latitudes. 
Just  outside  of  this  band,  the  maximum  revisit  time  increases  to  60  minutes.  This  large 
jump  is  due  to  the  fact  that  during  an  orbit  period,  an  MSE  outside  of  the  latitude  band 
may not see all four satellites. 

Figure 6.15: Contours of Average Time in View 

58 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

Figure 6.15shows the average amount of time in minutes that a satellite will stay in view. 
From  -30° N  to  30 °  S,  a  satellite will  stay  in  view  for  about  50 minutes. Notice  that  this 
corresponds to the inclination of the orbital planes, as is to be expected.

Launch Analysis12 

Although the space launch vehicle (LV) that will transport our spacecraft into orbit is not 
technically part of  the MINERVA system, planning  for  launch was critical  to our design. 
As  some  launch  options  would  cost  over  30%  of  our  total  budget  (to  IOC),  we  had  to 
carefully assess and  trade  those options,  lest  launch consume  too much of  the budget and 
unnecessarily limit other aspects of our design. 

6.6.1  Launch Vehicles 

The  first  set  of  launch  decisions  we  faced  concerned  the  boundaries  of  our  trade  space. 
There  are  a  number  of  LVs  available  for  commercial  use worldwide,  some  of which  are 
notably  reliable  and  low-cost,  but  planning  to  use  a  foreign  LV  would  involve  political 
risk.13 Likewise, new and improved LVs are constantly being developed, and several new 
systems are slated  to enter service by our  launch date, but as  their cost, performance, and 
availability have not yet been demonstrated, they involve technical risks. We attempted to 
minimize both political and technical risks by considering only demonstrated US LVs.14 

We took into account cost, availability, and several performance metrics, and selected the 
Athena  II,  Delta  II,  Delta  III,  and  Zenit  3SL  as  good  candidate  LVs  to  model  for  our 
design  trades. Figure 6.16, below, presents  the cost per kg of payload  transported  to Low 
Earth  Orbit  (LEO),  for  a  variety  of  US  launch  vehicles.  (While  this  measure  does  not 
reflect  efficiency  gains  that  some  LVs  may  provide  at  higher  orbits,  it  is  a  fair  overall 
estimate,  to first order.15)  It  is clear  from  this chart  that  the four LVs  identified above are 
among  the  most  cost-effective  options,  although  they  differ  significantly  in  terms  of 
absolute cost and performance. 

                                                

 

12 JMF 

13 In  the  current  state  of  the  world,  the  feasibility  of  commercial  launch  contracts  is  largely  determined  by 
international relations. US ventures, in particular, must consider the possibility that national security-related 
investigations may delay or even prohibit launch on foreign LVs. 

14 The  Zenit  3SL  is  the  only  LV  we  considered  that  might  be  controversial.  However,  we  maintain  that  it 
can be  included as a “US” LV, even  though  it  is manufactured  in Ukraine and Russia, because  it  is  the LV 
created  for  Sea  Launch,  a  multinational  venture  actually  led  by  a  US  company  (Boeing).  Moreover,  the 
Zenit 3SL has already been classified as a US system for certification and liability purposes. 

15 This  data  is  for  the  185  km,  28.5°,  circular  orbit.  Since  transporting  a  payload  from  the  ground  to  LEO 
requires much more energy than transporting it from LEO to higher orbits or escape, comparing LVs on the 
basis  of  their  cost-effectiveness  to LEO  is  reasonable.  It  is  also  a  convenient means  of  comparing  the  very 
disparate costs and performance levels of small and large LVs.

  Delta  II  –  a  medium-light  LV  produced  by  Boeing  –  a  very  reliable  and  fairly  low 
cost launch option, with sufficient capability for most launch scenarios. 

  Delta  III – a new medium LV produced by Boeing –  a  risky option, having  failed  in 
its only two launches to date, but Boeing claims to have resolved those problems (and 
will have seven more years before we launch), and the Delta III offers great capability 
at a moderate price. 

  Zenit  3SL  –  a medium multinational LV,  led  by Boeing  –  also  new  and  fairly  risky, 
Sea Launch  is  somewhat  larger  and  slightly more  expensive  than  the Delta  III, but  is 
designed for a different set of missions (equatorial launch to geosynchronous orbit). 

Finally, Figure 6.18 presents  the  relative cost and performance capabilities of  the Athena 
II, Delta  II, Delta  III,  and  Zenit  3SL.  This  chart  shows  how much  payload mass  each  of 
the vehicles could boost  in the two extreme launch scenarios: 400km LEO (blue columns

6.6.2  Launch Trades 

In  order  to  choose  between  the  candidate  LVs  we  needed  to  compare  their  capabilities, 
which  was  challenging  because  many  things  were  being  traded  simultaneously  in  our 
design  sessions.  For  any  given  payload  mass  and  launch  orbit  altitude,  we  would  run  a 
MATLAB module  to determine which of  the  four LVs would be  the most efficient. This 
in  itself  often  gave  us  many  choices,  as  the  specified  orbit  and  payload  mass  were  very 
unlikely  to  precisely  match  an  LVs  capabilities.  Instead,  we  would  find  that  the  most 
cost-effective  LV  could  either  transport  the  payload  to  a  higher  orbit,  or  transport  more 
mass, without affecting  the  launch price. This  impacted all of  the other design groups, as 
we had to collectively determine whether it would be most beneficial to  
launch to a higher altitude and save on-board propellant, or to 
launch  to  the  original  altitude  and  use  the  extra  mass  somewhere  else  in  the 
design (while remaining under our cost budget). 

This  was  really  a  trade  between  propulsion  from  the  launch  vehicle  and  propulsion  on-
board  the MINERVA  spacecraft.  For  example,  it  would  appear  that  we  could  save  a  lot 
by simply using an Athena II to just get us to LEO. In that case, however, we would need 
larger spacecraft equipped with a sufficient propulsion system and enough power and fuel 
to  boost  themselves  to Mars.  If  we  used  an  electric  propulsion  system,  they  would  need 
radiation shielding, for  they would have  to spiral out  through  the Van Allen belts. But all 
the  extra mass  for  the  structures, power, propellant,  and  shielding might mean we would 
need  three Athena  IIs,  at which  point  it would  be more  efficient  to  use  one  of  the  larger 
LVs. Or, for a less extreme example, we could use a Delta II to transport to LEO even for 
our  largest design scenarios, but  if our spacecraft could be made small enough, a Delta  II 
could launch them directly to Mars. 

At  the  same  time,  however,  we  had  to  consider  that  each  of  the  LVs  was  designed  for 
certain missions. While one LV would be more efficient for one launch scenario, it might 
not  be  for  a  slightly  higher  orbit  –  and  LV  performance  did  not  usually  scale  linearly.17 
For example, some of the performance curves for the Delta III are given in Appendix E. 

In  our  concurrent  design  sessions,  we  investigated  four  launch  scenarios:  LEO,  middle 
Earth orbit between the Van Allen radiation belts, geosynchronous orbit, and direct Earth 
escape.  It  soon  became  clear  that  the  best  options  were  the  two  extremes:  circular  LEO 
and direct Earth escape. LEO is efficient because we can use a smaller booster for a fairly 
low price, and then use high-Isp electric propulsion to spiral out and transit to Mars.18  

                                                

 

17 We  actually  had  to  contact  engineers  at  Boeing  and  Lockheed  Martin  to  ask  how  to  extrapolate  the 
published LV performance curves for a few of our launch scenarios, and they were very helpful. 

18 Isp  stands  for  specific  impulse,  which  is  the  ratio  of  thrust  to  propellant  mass  flow  rate.  Therefore  the 
higher the Isp of the rocket propellant, the more thrust it provides to the spacecraft per pound.

This would take longer, and it would also require radiation shielding, but we could afford 
the extra mass if we were only launching to LEO. Direct Earth escape is efficient because 
it makes  the most  out  of  paying  for  a  given  LV  (although  it  has  to  be  a  larger  one),  and 
allows us  to have  smaller  spacecraft  carrying much  less propellant.  Intermediate options, 
however,  tend  to  combine  the  disadvantages  of  both.  Launching  to  a  high  circular  orbit, 
for  example,  would  require  as  much  energy  from  the  LV  as  direct  escape  (if  not  more), 
but  would  also  require  propellant  to  spiral  out,  plus  radiation  shielding  to  protect  the 
spacecraft from  the upper Van Allen belt, both  increasing our mass – for no gain (in fact, 
it would take longer to get to Mars then the direct escape). 

After  further  analysis,  we  discovered  that  in  the  direct  escape  option,  we  could  replace 
the  electric  thrusters  with  small,  inexpensive,  chemical  thrusters.  This,  taken  into 
consideration  along  with  a  tight  budget,  made  direct  escape  via  Delta  III  a  better  option 
than LEO. The Delta III could provide enough hyperbolic excess velocity for MINERVA 
to  transit  directly  to  Mars,  and  all  we  needed  on  the  spacecraft  were  small  chemical 
propulsion systems to facilitate capture at the Mars end.

Constellation Set-up 

To  set  up  the  MINERVA  constellation  requires  four  phases  of  operations:  launch, 
interplanetary  transfer, Mars capture, and deployment. This section provides an overview 
of each phase. 

7.1 

Launch19 

MINERVA  will  be  launched  from  Cape  Canaveral  Air  Station  on  a  Delta  III  launch 
vehicle.  The  daily  launch  window  constraint  is  ± 1  s,  with  opportunities  occurring  once 
every  twenty-four  sidereal hours between August 3 and August 18, 2007. The window  is 
extremely tight due to the geometry of the parking orbit with respect to the ecliptic plane. 
As  the  launch site  rotates around  the Earth’s axis,  the orbit plane  into which  the Delta  III 
can  directly  launch  becomes  nearly  coplanar  with  the  ecliptic  plane  once  every  sidereal 
day. By launching early, the satellite may remain in Earth parking orbit until the time and 
position for the departure burn is achieved. Considering there is little leeway for slips due 
to  inclement  weather  or  vehicle  problems,  the  probability  of  a  successful  launch  is 
improved  by  attempting  to  launch  early  in  the  launch window  rather  than  later.  The  last 
launch opportunity occurs at 9:56 AM (GMT), August 18, 2007. 

For  launch,  the  four  MINERVA  spacecraft  will  be  connected  and  stowed  vertically 
within  the  Delta  III  payload  fairing  (refer  to  Table  7.1  for  a  detailed  description  of  the 
launch  sequence).  About  four  minutes  after  lift-off  the  LV  will  reach  an  altitude  of  120 
km, and the fairing will jettison. Shortly thereafter, the first stage of the LV will separate, 
and  the  second  stage will  ignite  to  boost  the  system  into  a  185  km  circular  parking  orbit 
with  an  inclination  of  28.5°.  Twenty-eight  minutes  later,  the  system  will  reach  the 
descending node of the parking orbit and will perform a short 35 s duration burn to move 
into  a  staging  orbit  with  an  inclination  of  23.45 °.  There  the  system  will  cruise  for  a 
minimum  of  three  hours,  and  potentially  several  days  depending  on  the  launch  date.  At 
the precise departure point, the second stage will re-ignite and the system will be boosted 
into  a  hyperbolic,  trans-Mars  orbit.  Once  the  second  stage  burn  is  complete,  the  second 
stage  will  drop  off,  and  the  MINERVA  spacecraft  will  separate  in  preparation  for  the 
transfer phase.

Interplanetary Transfer20 

The  transit  phase  begins  when  the  second  stage  of  the  Delta  III  is  restarted  to  boost  the 
system from the staging orbit around Earth into a trans-Mars trajectory (refer to Table 7.2 
for a detailed description of the transfer sequence). This phase will last for approximately 
283  days,  until  the  spacecraft  reach  the  Mars  sphere  of  influence.  The  entire  second 
stage/payload  assembly  will  be  spinning  about  the  velocity-aligned  axis  to  provide  a 
small  measure  of  stability  throughout  the  burn  and  to  minimize  the  effects  of  off-axis 
thruster  pointing  error.  The  burn  will  last  for  5  min  35  s  and  will  provide  3,799  m/s  of 
additional velocity to place the stacked constellation on a hyperbolic departure trajectory, 
timed  to  coincide  with  the  window  of  opportunity  for  the  interplanetary  transfer  orbit. 
Tracking  data  will  be  collected  after  the  burn  is  complete  to  establish  the  actual  flight 
path of the second stage/payload assembly.

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

Shortly  after  achieving  a  stable  departure  trajectory,  the  spacecraft  will  be  ejected  from 
the  assembly  using  a  spring-loaded  release  mechanism.  The  mechanism  will  provide 
approximately  0.3  m/s  of  velocity,  causing  the  first  satellite  to  move  slowly  away  from 
the  rest  of  the  assembly.  As  the  first  satellite  is  ejected,  the  upper  stage  begins  a 
programmed  timing  sequence  that  will  release  the  three  remaining  satellites  at  equal 
intervals  of  50  min  9  s.  The  timing  of  the  release  sequence  is  important  for  proper 
phasing  upon  arrival  at  Mars,  and  will  be  discussed  in  greater  detail  in  the  following 
section. 

Once  released  from  the  upper  stage,  each  satellite will  remain  inactive  for  sixty minutes 
to ensure safe clearance distance from  the rest of  the assembly. At  that point,  the satellite 
will  use  its  on-board  sensors  to  acquire  attitude  data  and  perform  a  de-spin  maneuver. 
Having  achieved  three-axis  stabilized  attitude  control,  the  satellite  will  slew  into  an 
Earth-Sun  facing  orientation.  The  constellation  will  be  ready  for  initial  on-orbit 
functionality tests once all four satellites are in this transfer configuration. 

As  the  spacecraft  reach  the  edge  of  the  theoretical Earth  sphere  of  influence  (SOI),  each 
one will  perform  an  alignment  burn  using  four  of  the ACS  thrusters working  in  tandem. 
The  purpose  of  the  burn  will  be  twofold:  to  align  the  velocity  vector  with  the 
interplanetary  transfer  trajectory  within  the  ecliptic  plane,  and  to  correct  for  trajectory 
errors  accumulated  through  the  launch  and  departure  phase  of  the  mission.  The  four 
thrusters will fire for 48 sec to achieve a ∆ V of 20 m/s. 

Correction  burns  may  be  performed  at  one  or  two  additional  points  along  the 
interplanetary transfer orbit. The need for these burns will be determined real-time by the 
operations  staff  based  on  the  projected  position  error  upon  reaching Mars.  Each  satellite 
will  perform  its  own  correction  burn,  but  must  also  maintain  proper  inter-satellite 
spacing. Therefore, any  and all correction burns will be coordinated  for  all  four  satellites 
from the Earth control center. 

As  each  satellite  approaches  the  Mars  sphere  of  influence,  it  will  perform  a  spin-up 
maneuver  to  obtain  an  angular  velocity  of  six  revolutions  per  minute.  The  satellite  will 
spin about  the velocity-aligned axis  to provide  stability  throughout  the upcoming capture 
burns  and  to minimize  the  effects  of  off-axis  thruster  pointing  error.  At  this  point  in  the 
mission  timeline,  the  solar  arrays  will  be  fully  extended,  meaning  the  spacecraft  will  be 
spinning about its major axis as well as the velocity vector. 

The  last  correction burn will be  the Mars  injection burn. This burn has  two  components: 
an in-plane component which aligns the velocity vector along a precise hyperbolic arrival 
trajectory,  and  an  out-of-plane  component  which  raises  or  lowers  each  spacecraft  into  a 
slightly inclined orbit with respect to the ecliptic plane. The first satellite in the formation 
will  raise  its  inclination  by  +27°,  with  the  following  satellites  alternating  between 
lowered  and  raised  inclination  (i.e.  the  second  satellite  will  change  its  inclination  by 
− 27°,  the  third by +27 °, etc.). Although  the actual plane change will be very  small,  it  is a 
critical maneuver  that  ensures  each  satellite will  arrive  at Mars with  the  correct  distance 
from  the  ecliptic  plane  to  achieve  a mission  orbit  of  the  desired  inclination.  Because  the 

68 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

burn  will  be  performed  at  the  sphere  of  influence  rather  than  a  lower  orbit,  the  desired 
plane change occurs with minimal ∆ V of 167 m/s. 
7.3  Mars Capture21 

The  Mars  capture  phase  begins  as  each  satellite  reaches  the  theoretical  sphere  of 
influence of Mars, at an altitude of roughly 577,000 km. This point will occur on or about 
May  29,  2008,  depending  on  the  precision  of  the  correction  burns  made  en-route.  The 
subsequent sequence of events for the capture regime is outlined in table 3. If the satellite 
is  properly  positioned  at  arrival,  it  will  naturally  enter  a  hyperbolic  trajectory  around 
Mars  in  the same plane as one of  the  two mission orbits, designated  for  reference here as 
the  ‘A’  plane.  When  the  hyperbolic  capture  trajectory  approaches  the  desired  mission 
orbit  altitude  of  2,000  km,  the  on-board  systems  will  automatically  initiate  a  19-second 
circularization burn. This burn will  slow  the  satellite by  a  ∆ V of 1,602 km/sec, placing  it 
in the desired mission orbit.

Precisely  50  minutes  after  the  first  satellite  reaches  the  Mars  sphere  of  influence,  the 
second satellite begins heading toward the planet for capture. The satellite will follow the 
same  sequence outlined  above,  except  that  it will  enter  a hyperbolic  capture  trajectory  in 
the  same  plane  as  the  second  mission  orbit,  designated  the  ‘B’  plane.  Since  the  second 
satellite arrived at the sphere of influence 50 minutes – which is ¼ the period of the 2,000 
km mission orbit – after  the first satellite,  it will complete  its circularization burn 90° out 
of  phase  with  the  first  satellite  as  desired  for  the  constellation  configuration.  The  third 
and  fourth  satellites will  arrive  in a  similar  fashion,  the  third being placed  in  the A plane

180° out of phase of the first satellite, and the fourth being placed in the B plane 180 ° out 
of phase with the second satellite. 

7.4 

Deployment22 

The  deployment  phase  begins  after  each  satellite  completes  its  respective  circularization 
burn.  Each  satellite  will  perform  a  de-spin  maneuver  to  return  to  three-axis  stabilized 
attitude control. In the meantime, ground controllers will obtain position fixes for all four 
satellites  and  determine  what  type  of  station-keeping  burn  each  one  will  perform  to 
configure the constellation as closely as possible to the specified design parameters. Once 
the  station-keeping  burns  are  complete,  the  satellites  will  slew  into  operational  nadir-
pointing  attitudes  and  deploy  the  large  high-gain  antennas.  Following  an  additional 
checkout  period,  the  constellation  will  achieve  Initial  Operational  Capability  (IOC)  on 
July 9, 2008.

On-Orbit Operations23 

This chapter begins with an overview of normal MINERVA operations.  It  then goes  into 
a  more  detailed  functional  analysis  of  four  main  categories  of  operations:  Earth  Uplink, 
Mars  Uplink,  Positioning  Loop,  and  Anomaly  Resolution.  This  functional  analysis 
includes a combination of functions and data flow due to the highly coupled nature of the 
MINERVA communication tasks and information. 

8.1  Overview 

Once  the  MINERVA  constellation  set-up  is  complete,  normal  on-orbit  operations  can 
commence,  so  IOC  should  be  reached  around  July  9,  2008.  This  phase  is  to  last  for  at 
least five years.  
Figure  8.1  diagrams  the  system’s  top-level  functional  flow,  in which Normal Operations 
appears as block 5 (a more detailed functional flow diagram is found in Appendix D).

of-sight,  a  satellite  should  come  into  view  at  least  every  twenty  minutes  and  it  should 
remain in view for an average of fifty minutes per pass. 

As  long  as  at  least  one  satellite  is  in  view,  an  MSE  will  be  able  to  send  or  receive 
communication data, except for the nineteen-day exclusion period when the Sun is on the 
Earth-Mars  axis.  Since  the  four  MINERVA  satellites  will  be  equally  distributed  around 
Mars,  at  least  two will  be  in  view  of Earth  at  all  times. Accordingly,  those  two  satellites 
will  conduct  communication  with  DSN.  Meanwhile,  all  four  satellites  will  be  able  to 
transmit  to and receive from MSEs and the other MINERVA satellites. Any  satellites not 
in  view  of  Earth  can  still  relay  communication  to  Earth  by  cross-linking.  That  was  the 
rationale  for making  all  four MINERVA  satellites  identical.Any MINERVA  satellite can 
provide  position  information  to  MSEs,  through  the  use  of  two-way  Doppler  radar  and 
two-way  ranging  techniques  (which  require  only  one  satellite  in  view  to  function).  The 
satellite will  initiate  the procedure by  sending a  signal  to  the MSE as  it comes  into view. 
When  the MSE  receives  this  query,  it  will  send  an  acknowledgment  reply.  Doppler  and 
range  data  are  taken  as  the  satellite  overflies  the MSE,  and  on-board  satellite  computers 
determine  the MSE’s  position.  (The  altitude  of  the MSE  is  known  from MOLA mission 
data.) While  not  quite  a  real-time  solution,  this process  can provide  a quick  approximate 
answer  (on  the  order  of  tens  of  kilometers),  which  can  be  improved  through  integration 
over time (see section 10.2.4.3.2 for further details). 

To perform  these  functions  for MSEs, MINERVA will operate  according  to  a user  table. 
Each  satellite will have a copy of  this  table, which will  list all  the MSEs along with  their 
last  known  (or  expected)  locations,  their  individual  communication  codes,  and  their 
action schedules. Thus  the  table  tells each satellite which MSEs should be  in view at any 
given  time,  how  to  contact  them,  and  whether  or  not  they  need  communication  or 
positioning  services. The  unique  communication  codes  enable MINERVA  to  distinguish 
between different MSEs,  and  to  serve multiple MSEs  simultaneously.  (If multiple MSEs 
are  in view at  the  same  time,  the data  rate  for  each may have  to be  limited;  this could be 
determined on Earth and added to the user table.) 

All satellites constantly poll all MSEs they expect to be in view. Every satellite will know 
where  all  satellites  and  MSEs  are  at  all  times,  because  the  user  table  and  satellite 
ephemeris  data  will  be  shared.  This  will  enable  MINERVA  to  direct  information  for  a 
given  MSE  to  the  closest  satellite,  either  currently  in  view  of  the  MSE  or  next  to  come 
into view.  

Any  MSE  that  receives  a  query  with  its  communication  code  is  required  to  send  a 
response. Upon  receipt of  the  response, MINERVA will downlink any  information  it has 
from  Earth  for  that  MSE.  In  addition,  the  satellite  can  uplink  information  to  be 
transmitted  back  to  Earth,  and/or  provide  position  information  to  the  MSE,  as  the  user 
table dictates. Principal  Investigators can modify  the user  table entries pertaining  to  their 
MSEs at any time. (Changes should be sent at least thirty minutes to one hour before they 
are to take effect, in order to travel to Mars and get processed in time.) 

The MINERVA  satellites  also  have  a  search mode,  in which  all  satellites  poll  a  specific 
target MSE,  whether  they  expect  to  be  in  view  or  not,  in  an  effort  to  find  it.  This  mode 

72 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

might  be  used  if  an MSE  fails  to  respond  after MINERVA  satellites  have  tried  to  poll  it 
several times, for example. 

Finally,  to  minimize  loss  of  data,  MINERVA  will  store  every  transmission  until  it 
receives  confirmation  of  receipt,  a  new  command  to  abort  that  transmission,  or  until  the 
backup storage buffer is full (at least three days). 

8.2 

Earth Uplink 

The  Earth  uplink  function  initiates  with  the  collection  of  data  and  commands  from 
Principal  Investigators  for  uplink  to MINERVA.  This  information  is  interleaved with  all 
of  the  data,  commands,  updates,  and  ephemeris  information  generated  at  the  Earth 
Ground  Station  for  the  MINERVA  satellites.  Processing  at  the  Ground  Station  will 
include  time  and  destination  tagging  of  the  information.  This  is  an  important  step  in  the 
function of  the system, because a majority of  the  information required by  the MINERVA 
system  is  generated  and  processed  on  the  ground  rather  than  by  an  autonomous  system 
aboard  the MINERVA  spacecraft. This  information  includes which users  the MINERVA 
system is to accommodate, at specific times, for specific durations. Tables of information 
tell  the  satellites  where  the  users  should  be,  and  how  to  process  uplink  and  downlink 
information for the users. 

This single data stream generated at  the Earth Ground Station passes by way of  the Deep 
Space Network  to  the MINERVA  spacecraft.  The  appropriate  destination  spacecraft  and 
time  required  for  transmission  are  determined  through  analysis  at  the  Ground  Station. 
Upon  arrival,  the  receiving  spacecraft  checks  the  transmission  for  completeness  and 
integrity, and de-interleaves the signal. Each specific segment of the signal will have both 
the destination and time tags mentioned earlier. 

1) If the message is to be relayed to other system elements or users, the segment is sent to 
a  buffer  until  the  appropriate  time.  The  MINERVA  satellite  initiates  a  communication 
request to the destination element (other MINERVA satellites or Mars Surface Elements) 
at  the  appropriate  time,  and  sends  the  transmission  upon  acknowledgement  of  the 
initialization. The  sending MINERVA  satellite will  then erase  the data  segment  from  the 
buffer once a confirmation is received from the destination element. 

2)  If  the  transmission  segment  is  for  use  of  the  receiving  MINERVA  satellite,  the  data 
segment  is  sent  to  the main  computer  for  processing. This  segment  includes  any  updates 
to 
the 
list  of  communication  and  positioning  users 
that  MINERVA  will  be 
accommodating,  as  well  as  ephemeris  data  with  which  the  satellite  updates  its  position. 
The  satellite  then  maneuvers  if  necessary.  Figure  8.2  presents  a  diagram  of  the  Earth 
uplink functions.

8.3  Mars Uplink 

Once  MINERVA  has  received  instructions  to  provide  communication  service  for  an 
MSE,  the  appropriate MINERVA  satellite  sends  a  communication  initialization  signal  to 
the user. The user  then uplinks  the data  to  the MINERVA satellite, where  it  is stored  in a 
data buffer. For  the  sake of  risk  reduction,  this buffer will allow  three days worth of data 
storage  to  account  for  anomalies  within  the  communication  stream.  MINERVA  then 
sends a confirmation to the user and interleaves the data with the next transmission to the 
Earth Ground Station. The  data  buffer  is  cleared when MINERVA  receives  transmission 
confirmation  from  the  Earth  Ground  Station.  Not  including  processing  time,  this  cycle 
will  occur  in  a  minimum  of  two  time  lengths  of  data  transmission  between  Earth  and 
Mars (about 45 minutes). Figure 8.3 is a diagram of the Mars uplink functions.

Positioning Loop 

The method  by which MINERVA  provides  positioning  to  its  users  includes  the majority 
of  the set-up analysis provided by  the Earth Ground Station, and  the actual calculation of 
the  positioning  solution  performed  aboard  the  spacecraft.  The  positioning  solution  loop 
begins with  service  instructions  provided  by  the  Earth Ground  Station,  and  an  update  of 
the  MINERVA  satellite’s  position  from  on-orbit  and  Earth-generated  orbit  propagation 
analysis.  These  service  instructions  will  include  which  MSE  to  provide  service  for, 
approximate  location  of  the  MSE,  and  the  length  of  time  for  which  to  provide  service. 
Similarly  to  the  Mars  Uplink  stream,  the  appropriate  MINERVA  satellite  sends  a 
positioning initialization signal to the user. Once the MINERVA satellite receives a reply, 
it  calculates  the  positioning  solution  and  sends  the  solution  to  the  user,  and  the  cycle 
repeats  itself  for  an  allotted  amount  of  time.  Should  this  positioning  cycle  require  a 
handoff  of  users  between  satellites,  this  information  will  be  included  in  the  instructions 
uplink from  the Earth Ground Station. The MINERVA satellite  then ends  the positioning 
cycle  per  the  positioning  instructions.  Figure  8.4  presents  a  diagram  of  the  positioning 
loop functions.

Anomaly Resolution 

The  anomaly/fault  resolution  stream  will  run  continuously  within  each  MINERVA 
satellite.  Should  a  satellite’s  regular  subsystem  checkout  identify  a  problem,  or  a 
subsystem  send  an  anomaly  flag,  the  spacecraft will  enter Safe Mode 1  (see  section 14.2 
for further description of safe modes). This mode  includes an autonomous analysis of  the 
anomaly,  and  any  autonomous  attempt  at  correcting  or  rerouting  around  the  anomaly.  If 
the  autonomous  analysis  cannot  resolve  the  anomaly,  the  satellite  enters  Safe Mode  2  or 
3.  These  modes  then  require  a  notification  to  the  Earth  Ground  Station  for  help  in 
resolving  the  problem.  MINERVA  then  receives  the  instructions  back  from  the  Ground 
Station and implements the instructions in the effort to return to normal operations status.

Disposal 

As  each  MINERVA  satellite’s  on-orbit  operations  phase  is  concluded  (as  it  exceeds  its 
design  lifetime  or  is  otherwise  no  longer  useful),  that  satellite  enters  its  final  mission 
phase,  and  has  the  capability  to  be  boosted  into  a  disposal  orbit with  an  altitude  of  2150 
km.

10.1  Communication System Design24 

10.1.1  Overview 

The  communication  system  consists  of  the  hardware  and  software  that  allows  the 
exchange  of  data  between  different  MSEs,  or  between  MSEs  and  the  Earth.  Enabling  a 
user on Mars to communicate through MINERVA reduces the amount of hardware that it 
has  to  carry  on  board.  Data  exchange  consists  of  commands  sent  to  MINERVA  or  to 
MSEs, scientific data sent back to Earth, or navigation signals sent to MSEs. 

To  provide  communication  on  the  other  side  of  Mars,  when  the  MSE  and  the  satellite 
covering  it  are  hidden  from  the  Earth,  it  has  been  decided  to  implement  cross-links 
between  the satellites. Satellite cross-links also  increase  the fault  tolerance of  the system. 
For  example,  if  a  satellite  loses  its  Earth  communication  link,  it  can  still  communicate 
with  Earth  through  another  satellite’s  communication  system  using  the  cross-link 
capability (see Figure 10.1). 

The  presence  of  cross-links  allows  communication  to  Earth  to  be  split  between  two 
satellites, which reduces the effective data rate per satellite.

On  Earth,  the  Deep  Space  Network,  which  is  used  for  most  deep  space  missions  and 
Mars missions, will be used to provide communication with MINERVA. 

The  communication  system  has  been  divided  into  different  subsystems  for  each  of  the 
types of links described in Figure 10.2.

Figure 10.2: The Three Different Types of Links 

 

 

All  the  communication  links  have  been  designed  using  a  margin  of  at  least  3  dB,  to 
compensate for  the fact  that a user might be  located at  the edge of half-power beamwidth 
of  the  satellite’s antenna  beam25. The communication  links have been designed using  the 
longest path length possible for each link. 

To  reduce  the  hardware  required  onboard  the  satellites,  it  has  been  decided  to  use  the 
same hardware for communication and for position determination. In fact, as explained in 
section  10.2,  the  principle  of  the  position  determination  system  is  to  send  a  signal  to  an 
MSE and analyze the response. 

                                                 

25 Beamwidth  refers  to  the  half-power  beamwidth  of  the  antenna, which  is  the  angle  across which  the  gain 
is within 3 dB (50%) of the peak gain.

10.1.2  Top-Level Trade Analysis 

This  section presents  the  top-level  trades  that  led  to  the choice of communication  system 
hardware.  The  goal  was  to  choose  a  type  of  antenna  for  the  three  communication  links 
(MINERVA-Earth, MINERVA-Mars and cross-links). 

The first section summarizes the different possible types of antennas, which were used as 
the basis  for  the  trade  studies. The next  sections  examine  the possibility of  integrating as 
many links as possible. 

10.1.2.1  Antenna Types 

Horn  type  antennas  were  abandoned  after  preliminary  calculations  because  of  their 
relatively  high  mass  and  volume  for  the  same  performance  as  a  helix  type  antenna  (see 
Table 10.1).

10.1.2.2 

Integrating the Three Link Types 

Integrating the three communication links has the advantage of minimizing the number of 
receiving  and  transmitting  systems.  This  option  was  quickly  rejected  because  of  some 
obvious technical difficulty, as explained below: 

The  simplest  solution  for  communicating  in  different  directions  is  an  omni-directional 
antenna.  However,  long  distance  communication  would  require  excessively  high 
transmission power (Figure 10.4). 

The  next  option  is  to  use  a  directional  antenna with  a  single main  lobe.  Such  an  antenna 
must  be  mechanically  or  electronically  steered  to  allow  communication  in  different 
directions,  as  shown  in  Figure  10.5.  It  follows  that  simultaneous  communication  in 
different directions is not possible. 

The  last  option  is  to  use  another  category  of  directional  antennas,  such  as  phased  array 
antennas,  which  can  produce  multiple  electronically  steered  beams.  In  this  case,  the 
antenna would have to electronically steer the beams over an angle of at least 180°. Using 
current technology, this is not feasible. Producing several beams with a parabolic antenna 
is  possible  if  using  off-axis  feeds,  but  is  not  a  viable  option  either  since  these  beams 
would still have to be mechanically steered.

Figure 10.5: Use of a Directional Antenna to Integrate the Three Different Links 

 

 

 

In  any  case,  integrating  all  the  links  reduces  the  system  reliability,  as  all  the  links  are 
dependent  on  a  single  antenna.  Adding  a  redundant  antenna  defeats  the  purpose  of 
integrating the links in the first place. 

10.1.2.3 

Integrating Cross-links and MINERVA-MSE Communication 

Another  option  we  looked  at  was  to  integrate  the  short-range  communication  links 
(MINERVA-MSE  link  and  Cross-Link)  and  to  use  a  separate  system  for  long-range 
communication  (see  Figure  10.6).  The  frequency  for  such  an  integrated  link would  have 
to be UHF, for compatibility with MSEs [Edwards, 2000]. 

The  first  option  is  to  use  a  single-beam  antenna.  In  this  case,  the  minimum  required 
beamwidth to enable simultaneous communication between satellites and with MSEs was 
determined by the orbit group as 101.9°, independently of altitude. 

The  corresponding  gains  for  parabolic  and  helix  antennas  are  4.1  dB  and  4.5  dB 
respectively (see SMAD, Table 13-14). This is too low for cross-links. 

The  cross-link  link  budget  shows  that  an  Effective  Isotropic  Radiated  Power  (EIRP)  of 
29.2 dBW is required for MINERVA cross-links. The transmitted power for the parabolic 
and helix antennas is therefore approximately 600W.

Figure 10.6: Integrating MINERVA-MSE Link and Cross-Link 

This  power  level  is  unrealistically  high  for  our  system,  and  this  option  is  therefore  not 
feasible. 

The second option  is  to use a phased array antenna. This option  is particularly  interesting 
since  phased  array  antennas  can  form multiple medium-to-high  gain beams  inside  a  total 
beamwidth  angle  of  more  than  120 °
26 .  This  technology  is  more  reliable  than 
mechanically steered antennas. Though it has not been used in deep space yet, it has been 
proven in many Earth missions similar to MINERVA. 

However,  most  of  the  phased  array  antennas  used  in  existing  systems  are  X-band,  Ka-
band  or  Ku-band.  Only  a  few  of  them  are  UHF,  and  are  used  as  radars  by  the  US  Air 
Force and the Royal Air Force, not as communication systems [Daher, 1998]. 

For this reason, we put aside the idea of integrating the MINERVA-MSE link with cross-
links. 

10.1.2.4  Considering Each Type of Link Separately 

The  option  finally  chosen  was  to  implement  each  type  of  link  separately  (see  Figure 
10.7). 

                                                 

26 A  Ka-Band  phased  array  antenna  is  under  development  at  NASA  that  will  be  able  to  scan  anywhere 
within  a  60 °   half  angle  cone  as  measured  from  the  antenna  boresight,  while  maintaining  all  other 
performance specifications [http://www530.gsfc.nasa.gov/tdrss/kaband.html].

This  solution  means  that  one  communication  subsystem  will  be  used  for  the  Earth-
MINERVA link, one for the MINERVA-MSE link and one for the Cross-Links. 

10.1.2.5  Modulation and Coding Techniques 

This  section  refers  to  SMAD  Section  13.3.3.  Modulation  in  SMAD  is  defined  as  “the 
process  by  which  an  input  signal  varies  the  characteristics  of  a  radio  frequency  carrier 
(usually  a  sine  wave)”.  These  characteristics  are  amplitude,  phase,  frequency  and 
polarization. On  the  receiver  side,  demodulation  of  the  signal measures  the  variations  in 
the  characteristics  of  the  received  carrier  and  deduces  what  the  original  signal  was.  For 
space  applications,  phase  or  frequency  modulation  techniques  are  preferred  because  the 
transmitter can operate at saturation for maximum power efficiency. 

The  most  common  modulation  techniques  used  in  satellite  systems  are  (see  SMAD 
Figure 13-8): 

  Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) 
Set the carrier phase at 0 ° to transmit a binary 0, and at 180° to transmit a binary 1. 
  Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) 
Take two bits at a time to define one of the four following binary symbols: 00, 01, 10, 
11.  Each  of  those  symbols  corresponds  to  one  of  the  four  carrier  phases:  0°,  90°, 
180°,  270°.  This  results  in  a  better  use  of  the  spectrum  than  BPSK,  but  is  more 
susceptible to phase disturbances. 

86 

•
•
MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) 
Set  the  carrier  frequency  at  a  frequency  F1  to  transmit  a  binary  0  and  at  a  frequency 
F2  to  transmit  a  binary  2.  It  is  not  susceptible  to  phase  disturbances.  However,  it 
requires a higher Eb/No and results in a poor use of the spectrum. 
BPSK is the standard deep space telemetry modulation format. 

To  demodulate  a  digital  bit  reliably,  the  amount  of  energy  received  for  that  bit, Eb, must 
exceed the noise spectral density, No, by a minimum factor. 

By  reducing  the  Eb/No  required  to  achieve  a  given  BER,  the  required  transmitter  power 
and  the  antenna  size  are  reduced,  or  the  link margin  is  increased. A  technique  to  reduce 
the  required  Eb/No  is  to  insert  extra  bits,  called  parity  bits,  into  the  data  stream  at  the 
transmitter.  These  bits  enable  the  receiver  to  detect  and  correct  a  limited  number  of  bit 
errors,  which  might  occur  in  the  transmission  because  of  noise  or  interference.  This 
technique is called forward error correction coding. It is common in deep space missions. 
For  example,  the  Pioneer  deep-space  communication  link  uses  this  technique  to  obtain 
the performance required to overcome the large space loss. 

A  common  type  of  error  correction  technique  is  convolutional  coding  with  Viterbi 
decoding, which greatly reduces the minimum Eb/No to obtain a specific BER. A rate-1/2 
convolutional  code  is  implemented by  generating  and  transmitting  two bits  for  each data 
bit.  The  data  rate  is  therefore  one-half  the  transmitted  bit  rate  (hence  “rate-1/2”). 
However,  recent  techniques  can  achieve  significant  coding  gains  without  increasing  the 
bandwidth. [Sklar, 1988] 

The  MINERVA  communication  system  design  is  based  on  BPSK  R-1/2,  K=7  Viterbi 
-6
b/No  of  5.1  dB  for  a  BER  of  10   (see  Figure 
Soft  DEC  modulation  that  requires  an  E
10.8).

The  value  of  Eb/No  below  which  error-free  communication  cannot  take  place  regardless 
of  the  data  rate,  is  known  as  the  Shannon  limit  and  is  equal  to  –1.6  dB. The MINERVA 
communication system was designed by taking this constraint into account. All the values 
given  in  Figure  10.8,  including  the  Shannon  limit,  are  theoretical  and  based  on  infinite 
bandwidth  transmission  channels  and  ideal  receivers.  These  values  were  used  as  good 
approximations  for  communication  systems  around  Mars  since  there  is  no  bandwidth 
limitation  there.  Losses  to  account  for  hardware  imperfections  were  included  in  the  link 
budgets.

10.1.3.2  Earth-MINERVA Link Design 

The main  functions  of  the MINERVA-Earth  link  include  telemetry  and  data  return  from 
Martian  missions  as  well  as  command  and  control  of  Martian  missions  from  Earth, 
including possible software uploads to Martian craft. 

The  Deep  Space  Network  (DSN)  will  be  used  for  communication  between  MINERVA 
and the Earth. 

10.1.3.2.1 

Design Trades 

Two of  the  four  satellites will have  simultaneous Direct-To-Earth  (DTE)  links. The  total 
communication bandwidth will be divided between these two links. 

The  requirement  for  data  return  is  10 Gb/sol. This  translates  into  an  average  data  rate  of 
112  kbps  (kilobits  per  second)  over  a  day.  The  data  rate  actually  used  must  take  DSN’s 
availability into account: 
•   MINERVA  will  be  allocated  one  DSN  pass  per  day.  This  corresponds  to  ten 
continuous hours of communication per day. 
  Five minutes  are  allocated  at  the  beginning  of  each DSN  pass  for DSN  pointing  set-
up.  An  additional  minute  is  allocated  for  satellite  acquisition  each  time  a  satellite 
comes  out  of  eclipse  from  behind  Mars.  With  three  satellites  periods  during  each 
DSN pass and  four  satellites,  this  translates  into a  total minimum of 17 min per DSN 
pass without actual data exchange. 
•   For  Mars  Global  Surveyor  (MGS),  DSN  guarantees  that  less  than  5%  of  the 
transmitted data will be lost or corrupted everyday. 

 

91 

•
MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

Taking  all  these  factors  into  account,  the  effective  DSN  availability  is  37%.  To  transfer 
10  Gb/sol,  each  of  the  two  satellites  sustaining  a  DTE  link  must  therefore  transmit  at  a 
data rate of 150 kbps. 

The Earth-MINERVA  link budget was calculated for a maximum distance between Mars 
and Earth equal to 401,300,000 km. For lower distances, data rates can be increased. 

For  the  design  of  the  MINERVA-Earth  link  antenna  a  trade  analysis  was  performed 
between  the  following  types  of  antennas.  The  primary  driver  for  the  choice  of  antenna 
type  is  the  distance  between  Mars  and  the  Earth,  which  ranges  from  a  minimum  of 
approximately 50 million km  to a maximum of 400 million km. This  link requires a high 
gain antenna. 

Phased  array  antennas,  such  as  the  ones  used  on  LEO  satellites  to  communicate  with 
TDRSS, have an EIRP of approximately 33 dBW as opposed  to  the 71 dBW MINERVA 
requires.  This  type  of  antenna  is  more  suited  to  medium  to  high  gain  applications  with 
high  data  rates  (over  1  Mbps)  than  to  relatively  low  data  rate  deep  space  missions  with 
power constraints. 

Parabolic  antennas  are  therefore  the  best  choice  for  this  link.  As  the  frequency  is 
increased,  the  antenna  diameter  for  a  given  gain  decreases.  Therefore,  to  minimize  the 
antenna diameter, Ka-band was chosen as the frequency for this link. 

Table 10.2 contains numerical values for the link budget design for the MINERVA-Earth 
link.

10.1.3.3  MINERVA-Mars Link Design 

10.1.3.3.1 

Design Trades 

The  main  purpose  of  the  MINERVA-Mars  link  is  to  provide  communication  between 
MINERVA satellites and MSEs. 

The distinctive features of the MINERVA-Mars link are: 
•   0.4 GHz uplink 
  0.437 GHz downlink 
  High beamwidth to maximize surface coverage area (77° for 2000 km altitude) 
  Low gain 

 
The necessity of  supporting  existing  assets on  the Martian  surface determined  the  choice 
of  UHF  band  for  the  MINERVA-Mars  link.  In  designing  this  link,  it  was  assumed  that 
MSEs transmit at least 10 W of RF power using an omni-directional antenna (gain 0 dB). 

The coverage analysis following from the constellation design determined that each MSE 
is  in view of  a  satellite 65% of  the  time. MINERVA must be  able  to  receive  a  total of  at 
least  10  Gb/sol  from  the  MSEs.  Assuming  that  at  least  two  users  equally  share  the  link 
this corresponds to a minimum data rate of 86 kbps per user. 

For  the  design  of  the  MINERVA-Mars  link  parabolic,  helix,  and  phased  array  antennas 
were considered. 

A  parabolic  antenna  with  the  required  gain  and  beamwidth  would  have  a  diameter  of 
approximately  70  cm,  which  is  smaller  than  the  UHF  wavelength  (75  cm).  Since 
parabolic  dishes  do  not  work  unless  their  diameter  is  several  wavelengths,  a  parabolic 
antenna is not appropriate for this link. 

Helix  antennas  are  well  suited  for  applications  with  frequencies  below  2  GHz  and  high 
beamwidth.  A  phased  array  antenna  with  the  same  beamwidth  and  gain  characteristics 
would be more costly and complex. 

Therefore we selected a non-steerable helix antenna for the MINERVA-Mars link. 

Since  the  antenna  beam  is  conical,  two  different  cases  can  be  distinguished:  a  user 
located at the edge of the cone, and a user located right under the satellite in the center of 
the cone. The MINERVA-Mars  link budget was  calculated  for  the worst  case  (maximum 
range), which is at the edge of the cone.

10.1.3.4  Cross-Link Design 

10.1.3.4.1 

Design Trades 

The advantages of implementing cross-links are: 
•   Data being  transmitted  to Earth can be split between  two satellites, which reduces  the 
data rate requirements for each DTE link. 
  MSEs  located  on  the  other  side  of  Mars  can  still  communicate  with  Earth  through 
MINERVA. 
  Different  MSEs  located  beyond  line-of-sight  of  each  other  can  communicate  with 
each other through MINERVA. 

 

X-band  was  chosen  for  the  cross-links  because  it  provides  a  larger  beamwidth  than  Ka-
band  or  Ku-band  for  a  given  antenna  diameter.  This  reduces  the  constraints  on  antenna 
steering.  Furthermore,  X-band  allows  for  a  smaller  antenna  size  than  lower  frequency 
bands such as S-band or C-band.

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

Communication  availability  between  the  MINERVA  satellites  is  required  to  be  at  least 
90%.  The  link  is  designed  for  the  worst-case  data  rate,  when  10  Gb/sol  must  be 
transferred  between  two  satellites. This  translates  into  a maximum  data  rate  of  125  kbps 
for cross-links. 

Trade  study  options  for  the  antenna  type  included  parabolic,  helix,  and  phased  array 
antennas.  Helix  and  phased  array  antennas  can  provide  a  larger  beamwidth,  which  is 
desirable for cross-links because it minimizes the need for mechanical steering. 

However,  the  choice  of  antenna  type  was  finally  determined  by  the  decision  to  use  the 
cross-link antenna  for communication with  the Earth during  the  transfer phase. The main 
Earth-link  antenna  cannot  be  used  during  the  transfer  phase  because  the  insertion  burns 
produce  acceleration  on  the  order  of  ten  g’s  which  the  antenna  boom  structure  cannot 
handle. 

A  parabolic  antenna  that  is  designed  to  give  a  wide  beamwidth  at  X-band,  will  have  a 
narrow  beamwidth  with  high  gain  at  Ka-band.  This  gives  good  cross-link  and  transfer 
link  capability  in  a  single  antenna,  provided  the  transfer  link  frequency  is  chosen  to  be 
Ka-band.  Both  bands  will  not  be  used  simultaneously.  Two  feeds  are  included  in  the 
antenna, one for each band28. 

To  increase  the  reliability  of  the  system,  two  omni-directional  antennas  are  included  in 
each satellite to be used for cross-links in case the attitude control is lost. 

10.1.3.4.2 

Link Budget 

The  link budget was  calculated  for  the maximum distance between  the  satellites orbiting 
Mars, which is equal to 7633 km at an altitude of 2000 km. 

Table 10.4 contains numerical values for the link budget for the MINERVA cross-links at 
X-band. 

Table  10.5  contains  numerical  values  for  the  link  budget  for  the  MINERVA  cross-link 
antennas to be used with Ka-band for the DTE link during Mars approach. 

Table  10.6  contains  numerical  values  for  the  link  budget  for  the  MINERVA  cross-links 
using X-band and an omni-directional antenna. 

                                                 

28 Note that the use of cross-link antenna during Mars approach will be possible only at a distance less than 
289,000,000 km.

Figure 10.10: Virtual Connection 

By  default,  data  routing  in  the  MINERVA  constellation  will  be  pre-planned  on  Earth 
assuming  that  the  location  of  each  MSE  involved  in  the  communication  procedures  is 
known. For a detailed description of the Earth-based routing algorithm, see section 8. 

Automatic  routing  was  also  included  in  the MINERVA  system  as  an  alternative  routing 
solution. This section describes the automatic routing procedure to be performed onboard 
MINERVA  satellites  when  MSE  locations  are  unknown  or  when  direct  data  transfer 
between MSEs is required. 

To  ensure  that  data  from  Earth  reaches  its  destination  on  the Mars  surface  and  that  data 
from MSEs reaches the Earth, MINERVA will use the principle of virtual connections. 

102 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

As shown in Figure 10.10, data can follow several possible paths. One of these paths will 
be established as a virtual connection in accordance with the following procedure: 

When  data  has  to  be  uploaded  to  some  specific  craft  on  the  Martian 
surface,  a  packet  is  first  broadcast  to  all  satellites  containing  information 
identifying  the  craft.  Then  each  of  the  satellites  tries  to  establish  a 
connection  with  this  craft.  One  of  the  satellites  will  be  successful.  A 
virtual  connection will  be  established  through  this  satellite  and whichever 
of  its  closest  neighbors  that  has  a  link  with  the  Earth,  unless  the  satellite 
itself  has  a  link  with  the  Earth  (see  Figure  10.10).  The  newly  established 
virtual connection becomes the path followed by all signals. 

To  implement  this  feature  each  satellite will have  a  routing  table  including  entries of  the 
following form: 

 

 

Next host address 

Next router address 

… 

… 

‘Next  host  address’  contains  all  data  destinations  including MINERVA  satellites, MSEs, 
and  Earth  ground  stations.  ‘Next  router  address’  corresponds  to  MINERVA  satellites. 
The  meaning  of  each  entry  is  as  follows:  data  for  a  ‘next  host’  will  be  sent  to  a  ‘next 
router’,  unless  the  ‘next  host’  is  in  the  subnet  of  the  router  that  received  a  packet.  A 
subnet can be as small as a single Martian craft. 

As  satellites move  around Mars,  the  routing  tables  are  dynamically  updated. This means 
that  when  the  MSE  moves  out  of  the  coverage  area  of  a  particular  satellite  and  the  link 
between  them  is  lost,  every  satellite  tries  to  establish  connection  with  the  MSE  again. 
This time a different satellite will be successful, and the same procedure as before will be 
used to establish a virtual connection. 

The  same  procedure  will  apply  to  data  return  from  an  MSE  to  Earth.  In  each  packet  of 
data  sent  by  an  MSE,  Earth  will  be  indicated  as  the  destination  address.  A  satellite 
receiving the packets will forward them in accordance with its routing table to whichever 
of  its  closest  neighbors  has  a  link  with  Earth,  unless  the  satellite  itself  has  a  link  with 
Earth.

10.1.5  Payload Risk Tolerance 

10.1.5.1  Failure Modes Analysis 

The  MINERVA  communication  network  has  been  designed  to  allow  for  a  graceful 
degradation of performance in case of a failure. 

This section summarizes the possible impacts of a failure in the communication system. 

10.1.5.1.1 

Ka-band Communication Subsystem Failure 

The Ka band  communication  subsystem  can  fail  if  the  antenna,  the  steering motor or  the 
two Ka-band transponders fail. 

Whatever  the  number  of  Ka-band  failures  in  the  constellation,  the  availability  and  data 
rate of the MINERVA-Mars link do not change (65%). 

However, the Earth-link will be affected as follows: 

•  

•  

•  

•  

If  the Ka-band  subsystem  fails on one out of  the  four  satellites,  the availability of  the 
link  to  Earth  does  not  change  (37%).  The  data  return  rate  (10  Gb/sol  at  the  farthest 
distance  from  the Earth)  does  not  change,  because  three  satellites  are  always  in  view 
of  the Earth. Therefore, MINERVA  can  still  have  two  active DTE  links  by  choosing 
two operational satellites from the three in view. 
If  the Ka-band subsystem fails on  two out of  the four satellites,  the availability of  the 
link  to  Earth  does  not  change  (37%)  because  at  least  one  operational  satellite  will 
always  be  in  view  of  the  Earth.  The  instantaneous  data  rate with  the  Earth  decreases 
by  a  factor  of  two when  both  of  the  failed  satellites  are  in  view  of  the Earth  because 
only  the  third  satellite  in  view  of  the  Earth  can  be  used.  When  one  or  none  of  the 
failed  satellites  are  in  view  of  the Earth,  the  instantaneous  data  rate  does  not  change. 
There  will  therefore  be  a  slight  degradation  in  the  total  data  return  only  if  the  two 
antennas fail on two adjacent satellites. 
If the Ka-band subsystem fails on three out of the four satellites, the availability of the 
link  to  Earth  is  degraded  because  no  link  is  possible  when  the  only  operational 
satellite  is  in  eclipse  behind Mars.  The  instantaneous  data  rate  to  Earth  is  zero when 
the  operational  satellites  is  in  eclipse  and  is  divided  by  two when  it  is  in  view  of  the 
Earth. The total data return thus decreases by slightly less than a factor of four. 
If  the  Ka-band  subsystem  fails  on  all  four  satellites  the  cross-link  antennas  can  be 
used to communicate with Earth, at a very low data rate. 

 
10.1.5.1.2 

Cross-Link Subsystem Failure 

Whatever  the  number  of  cross-link  failures,  the  link  availability  to  MSEs  remains  the 
same  (65%). Only  a  fraction  of  the  opportunities  for  near-real  time  communication with 
Earth is lost. 

104 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

If  one  cross-link  fails,  the  same  amount  of  data  can  be  transferred  through  the  system. 
The only difference is that there is only one path the data can follow. The performance of 
the system does not degrade. 

If two cross-links fail, the constellation is divided into two parts that cannot communicate 
with  each other directly. The  total data  return  to  the Earth decreases  if  the data  collected 
from  the MSEs  over  one  day  happens  to  be  unevenly  distributed  among  these  two  parts 
of the constellation. 

10.1.5.1.3 

UHF Subsystem Failure 

If  a UHF  subsystem  fails  on  one  satellite,  the MINERVA  availability  to MSEs  degrades 
to  50%,  which  still  meets  the  minimum  requirements.  The  total  data  return  to  the  Earth 
will  depend  on  the  data  that  MINERVA  can  get  from  the  MSEs  with  this  slightly 
degraded availability. If enough power is available on the MSEs or if a slight degradation 
in BER is acceptable, the link data rate will be increased and the total data return will still 
exceed 10Gb/sol. In the worst case, the data return will be 8 Gb/sol. 

As  several UHF  subsystems  fail,  the availability and  total data  return  continue degrading 
similarly, as shown in Table 10.7: Graceful Degradation of Availability

10.1.5.1.4 

Amplifier Failure 

If  a  single  satellite  loses one of  its  three amplifiers,  the  total available payload RF output 
power  drops  to  110W. This  power  is  sufficient  to  fully maintain  the  link with  the MSEs 
and  the  cross-links,  and  to  communicate  with  the  Earth  at  a  reduced  data  rate.  Because

two  other  satellites  will  always  be  in  view  of  the  Earth,  the  total  data  rate  to  Earth  still 
exceeds the requirements. 

If several satellites lose one of their three amplifiers, the only performance degradation is 
a reduction in the total data return to the Earth at the farthest Earth-Mars distance. 

10.1.5.2  Alternative Earth Ground Station 

In case DSN goes down or  is available  less  than  ten hours per day, other radio  telescopes 
could be used to communicate with MINERVA.  

An  example  is  the  Sardinia  Radio  Telescope  (SRT),  which  is  being  built  in  Italy. 
Tracking NASA/ESA deep space probes is one of its goals. It will be able to receive both 
at Ka-band and at X-band, but transmit only at X-band. 

The main  antenna on MINERVA  satellites will have  an  additional X-band  feed  to use  in 
case  such  a  telescope  has  to  be  used.  This  adds  flexibility  to  the  system  without  adding 
significant mass or cost, because the transponders used already support both Ka-band and 
X-band. 

Assuming  we  can  use  an  alternative  telescope  like  SRT,  the  main  effect  of  losing  the 
DSN  link  is  a  reduction  in  the  availability  of  the  Earth-Mars  link,  and  a  degradation  of 
the total data return per sol.

10.2  Position Determination System Design30 

The top-level position determination requirement  is to provide positioning  to all MSEs in 
the  ±15°  latitude  band  with  an  accuracy  of  100  m.  We  break  this  requirement  into  two 
main steps: 

1.  Determine  the MINERVA  satellites  positions  with  respect  to  a Mars-fixed  reference 
frame  with  an  accuracy  of  at  least  100  m.  This  will  hereafter  be  called  orbit 
determination. 

2.  Determine MSEs  positions with  respect  to MINERVA  satellites with  an  accuracy  of 
at  least  100  m.  This  is  the  step  usually  described  under  the  name  position 
determination. 

The  positioning  information  has  no  time  constraint  other  than  that  naturally  imposed  the 
MSE  velocity.  This  velocity  limits  the  time  to  gather  measurements  for  one  positioning 
estimate.  It does not  limit  the  time  to process  this  information, which  is  left  to  the choice 
of the MINERVA team.

10.2.1  Position Determination Design Trades 

This  section explains  the designs  trades  that  led  to  the choice of a position determination 
method. 

10.2.1.1  Active versus Passive Position Determination 

Position  determination  may  be  performed  with  or  without  input  from  the  user.  The  first 
case  is  referred  to  as  ‘active  position  determination’  and  the  second  ‘passive  position 
determination’. 

Passive  position  determination may  be  performed  using  the  same  systems  used  in  target 
tracking, for example,  IR (infrared) and radar systems. The advantage of passive position 
determination  is  that  it  does  not  require  communication  with  the  user.  The  primary 
disadvantage of passive  systems  is  the  increase  in  the  computational burden.IR detection 
uses  the heat  emitted by  objects  to detect  them. Successful detection  therefore  requires  a 
temperature  difference  between  the  object  being  detected  and  the  ambient.  Since  dust 
storms  can  raise  the  ambient  temperature  by  10°C,  detection  in  storms  may  be  difficult. 
Accurate  position  determination  requires  precise  attitude  control  of  the  satellite,  and  the 
strictness  of  this  requirement  increases  with  altitude.  Once  an  IR  image  has  been 
collected, it has to be processed in order to identify  the target. This implies that there will 
be  a  high  computational  requirement  per  position  determination  solution.Radar  position 
determination  involves  bouncing  an  RF  signal  off  the  target  and  using  the  time  delay 
from  transmission  to  reception  to  determine  the  target  range.  Unfortunately,  the 
surrounding  ground  also  reflects  the  radar  signal.  Unwanted  ground  return  is  called 
ground clutter. If the target is moving, its Doppler frequency may be used to distinguish it 
from  the ground clutter. Stationary  targets may be detected using high resolution SAR or 
similar  systems  to  map  the  ground  and  target.  Since  the  entire  search  area  has  to  be 
mapped  in  order  to  identify  the  target,  this  results  in  a  very  high  computational  load  per 
position determination solution. 

Since  the  communication  requirement  means  that  there  will  be  a  communication  link 
between  the  satellites  and  the  rovers,  and  given  the  above  disadvantages  of  passive 
systems, we decided to use active position determination. 

10.2.1.2  One-way versus Two-way Position Determination 

In  the  presence  of  a  communication  link  between  the  satellites  and  the  MSEs,  range  or 
Doppler  shift  measurements  provide  useful  positioning  information  and  are  not 
computationally demanding. 

Active  positioning methods  can  use  either  a  one-way  or  a  two-way  communication  link. 
Systems  that  require  only  a  one-way  link,  like  the  Global  Positioning  System  (GPS), 
present  the  advantage  of  being  available  to  any  number  of  simultaneous  users.  On  the 
other hand, measuring  a  one-way  time delay  adds  the  satellite/user  clock offset  as  a new 
unknown,  unless  their  clocks  are  perfectly  synchronized.  Similarly,  measuring  one-way 
Doppler shift adds  the satellite/user frequency offset as a new unknown, unless  they both 
have precise frequency references. Such an unknown offset is time varying. Solving for it 

107 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

therefore  requires  simultaneous  redundant  measurements,  which  means  increasing  the 
number of satellites. 

Since  the  number  of  Mars  surface  elements  (MSEs)  is  limited  and  since  they  will  all 
establish a two-way communication link with the MINERVA system, we decided to use a 
two-way positioning method.

The  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  the  different  possible  positioning  methods  are 
summarized  in Table 10.8. Numbers  in  italics  indicate  the number of  satellites necessary 
to  resolve  the  ambiguity  in  real  time.  With  inclined  orbits,  ambiguities  can  also  be 
resolved  by  waiting  long  enough  for  the  planet's  rotation  to  break  the  symmetry  around 
the satellite ground track. 

10.2.1.3  2D versus 3D Position Determination 

Determining  an MSE  position  involves  solving  for  three  unknown  coordinates, which  a-
priori  requires  at  least  three  independent  measurements.  Prior  to  any  measurement,  we 
know  that  MSEs  are  located  near  the  Mars  surface.  Operators  of  Mars  surface  missions 
require their spacecraft’s position with respect to a Martian surface grid of reference. This 
means  that  only  two-dimensional  positioning  is  required,  provided  the Martian  topology 
can be estimated to the required accuracy.

We decided  to  capitalize on  the data  currently being  collected by  the Mars Orbiter Laser 
Altimeter  (MOLA)  on  board  the  Mars  Global  Surveyor  (MGS)  spacecraft.  This 
experiment  has  already  determined  the Martian  topology with  an  accuracy  of  13 m  on  a 
0.25°  x  0.25°  surface  grid  [Smith,  1999].  This  means  that  the  altitude  of  the  Martian 
surface  is known at points placed every 15 km over  the whole planet. The accuracy of an 
interpolation between these reference points is limited by the surface topology variability. 
Slopes of up to 4 km elevations over 300 to 1300 km are observed in the transition phase 
between  the  smooth  Northern  hemisphere  and  the  rough  Southern  hemisphere  of  Mars 
[Aharonson, 1998]. This corresponds to 200 m elevation over 15 km. 

We  decided  to  perform  two-dimensional  position  determination  assuming  knowledge  of 
the Martian  altitude  at  any  point  with  an  accuracy  of  200  m.  Knowledge  of  the Martian 
topology  is  still  being  improved  by  the  MOLA  experiment  and  can  be  expected  to  give 
better estimates by the time the MINERVA mission is operational. 

10.2.1.4 

Instantaneous versus Long-term Position Determination 

Instantaneous two-dimensional positioning requires taking two independent simultaneous 
measurements. This can be done by measuring both two-way range and two-way Doppler 
shift between one  satellite  and  the MSE. This  is  easily done with  typical  communication 
hardware  [Levanon, 1998], which  already  exists on  the MINERVA  satellites  to meet  the 
communication  requirements.  Simply  adding  a  stable  frequency  reference  improves  the 
measurement accuracy. 

However, this method leads to ambiguous solutions and singularities that can be resolved 
only  by  the  use  of  a  second  satellite.  Continuous  double  coverage  would  therefore  be 
required to provide instantaneous position determination with 100 m accuracy. 

Since most Mars surface elements are very slow moving, instantaneous positioning is not 
required.  Determining  an  MSE's  position  with  100  m  accuracy  makes  sense  if  the  MSE 
has  traveled  less  than 50 m during  the measurement period. The  requirement  is  therefore 
to  gather  sufficient  positioning  information  in  less  than  three  hours  (three  hours 
positioning update rate). 

This time period enables the MINERVA system to gather enough positioning information 
without the need for either double or continuous coverage. 

We  therefore  decided  to  provide  positioning  by  measuring  two-way  range  and  two-way 
Doppler shift between an MSE and one satellite at a time. 

10.2.1.5  Communication Signal versus Positioning Signal 

Communication  between  a  MINERVA  satellite  and  an  MSE  during  the  time  in  view  is 
continuous and performed at a relatively high data rate. Positioning measurements on  the 
other hand can be performed at discrete instants during a satellite pass and can use a very 
low data rate. 

109 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

In order  to  simplify  the concurrent handling of  these  two  functions, MINERVA allocates 
a dedicated frequency channel to the positioning message. 

Code division multiplexing is used on this channel. A separate spread spectrum code will 
be  allocated  to  each  MSE.  This  code  will  enable  MINERVA  to  isolate  signals  from 
different MSEs within  the  same  satellite  footprint. CDMA provides a convenient method 
for measuring range, as used by GPS. 

Range measurement  accuracy  is  inversely proportional  to  the  frequency used  for  coding. 
This  frequency  must  however  be  at  least  an  order  of  magnitude  smaller  than  the  carrier 
frequency, namely 400 MHz. MINERVA will use pseudo-random codes at about 4 MHz. 

Overlap  of  satellite  footprints  can  occur  in  the  existing  MINERVA  constellation  and  is 
expected  to  increase  as  the  mission  expands.  Therefore,  satellites  must  isolate  their 
positioning  signals  from  those  originating  from  different  satellites.  This  is  achieved  by 
assigning each satellite a low frequency code, which is superimposed on the MSE code. 

10.2.2  Orbit Determination  

This  section  explains  the  trades  that  led  to  the  choice  of  an  orbit  determination  method 
and summarizes the orbit determination scheme. 

10.2.2.1  Orbit Determination Design Trades 

The  requirement  to  provide  positioning  with  100  m  accuracy  places  an  upper  bound  on 
the accuracy in the satellite's orbit (namely 100 m). 

Two main kinds of orbit determination methods exist: 

Earth tracking and processing 

The  first  method  is  to  have  Earth  ground  stations  determining  the  orbits  completely, 
from satellite tracking to orbit reconstruction. This has been the method used by most 
space  missions  to  date.  DSN  is  designed  to  perform  one-way,  two-way  and  even 
three-way31 range and Doppler tracking of deep space satellites. The only requirement 
on  the spacecraft  is  to have a communication  link with  the ground station, which will 
necessarily  be  the  case  for  MINERVA.  This  method  is  relatively  easy  and  has  been 
extensively proven on Mars missions. 

However,  there  is  a mathematical  upper  bound  on  the  accuracy  achievable  by  such  a 
method  [Wood,  1986].  Furthermore,  in  order  to  reach  good  accuracy,  the  satellites 
must be  tracked over  a  long period of  time  (typically  a whole DSN pass). Additional 
delay  is  added  by  light  travel  time  between  the Earth  and Mars,  and  orbit  processing 

                                                 

31  Three-way  Doppler  corresponds  to  performing  Very  Long  Baseline  Interferometry  with  two  DSN 
stations at a time.

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

time.  This  method  is  therefore  useful  for  daily  orbit  reconstruction,  but  cannot  be 
used to update the satellites’ ephemeredes in real time. 

On-board Orbital Propagator 

If  100-m-accuracy  positioning  is  required  in  real  time,  the  satellites’  positions  must 
be  determined  in  real  time  with  better  than  100  m  accuracy.  For  a  Mars  orbiting 
spacecraft,  this  instantaneous  accuracy  cannot  be  reached  by measurements  from  the 
Earth. A solution is to carry a high precision orbital propagator on-board the satellites 
and  take  local measurements  to  continuously  update  the  satellite  ephemeredes.  Earth 
could still determine the initial ephemeredes on a daily basis. The local measurements 
can be of several types: 

  Ground Beacon Positioning 

Beacons  on  Mars  could  play  the  role  of  a  ground  network.  Earth  could  initially 
determine  their  location with an accuracy of a few meters by  simultaneously  tracking 
the  beacons  and  the  satellites  over  several  days  [Vijayaraghavan,  1992].  The  same 
method  used  for  positioning  of  Mars  surface  elements  could  then  be  used  to 
determine  the  satellites’  positions  with  respect  to  these  Mars  references.  A  fairly 
intense  and  homogeneous  network  of  ground  stations  would  be  needed  to 
continuously maintain the required accuracy. 

  Altimetry 

An instrument such as a laser altimeter can be used to accurately measure the distance 
from  a  satellite  to  the  Martian  surface.  The  Mars  Orbiter  Laser  Altimeter  (MOLA) 
used  on  the  Mars  Global  Surveyor  (MGS)  spacecraft  measures  altitude  with  an 
accuracy  of  tens  of  centimeters.  Altimeter  crossovers  also  enable  the  MGS  team  to 
determine the satellite’s orbit with an accuracy of a few meters. Such a method avoids 
the  complexity  associated with  landing  a  network  of  beacons  on Mars. However,  the 
mass  of  such  an  instrument  (44  kg)  exceeds  the  maximum  payload  mass  on  a 
MINERVA satellite. 

Satellite Relative Positioning 

Satellite  cross  links  can  be  used  to  measure  range  and  Doppler  shift  between  two 
satellites. However, the satellite’s positions with respect to a Mars-fixed frame cannot 
be known without reference  to a Mars fixed point. This method can  therefore be used 
only to improve the accuracy of orbit determination using ground beacons. 

In  addition  to  the  disadvantages  mentioned  above,  this  second  type  of  orbit 
determination places a very high computational load on the constellation. Such a level 
of computational autonomy has never yet been used in space. 

We  therefore  decided  to  determine  the  satellites’  orbit  by  DSN  tracking  and  Earth  post-
processing. 100-m-accuracy position determination will not be available in real time.

10.2.2.2  Orbit Determination Method 

10.2.2.3  Satellite Ephemeris 

DSN will help determine MINERVA orbits with a similar process to that used for MGS. 

Precise orbit determination requires: 

The tracking data recorded over a whole DSN pass (ten hours) 
MGS  is  tracked  by  DSN  with  0.54  mm/s  (3 σ )  accuracy  in  the  Doppler  shift 
measurement  and  13.4  m  (3σ )  accuracy  in  the  range  measurement  [MGS_Reqs, 
1995].  This  performance  corresponds  to  an X-band  communication  link. MINERVA 
will  use  Ka-band  to  communicate  with  DSN.  Since  the  wavelength  at  Ka-band  is 
shorter  than  at  X-band,  DSN  may  be  able  to  reach  even  better  accuracy  for 
MINERVA. 
  A high degree and order standard gravity field model 
The  gravity  field  model  is  itself  continuously  improved  by  the  MGS  orbit 
determination process.  It currently consists of 70  ×
 70 gravity coefficients and can be 
expected to be even better by 2008 [Lemoine, 1999]. 
  A high precision model for non-conservative forces 
Since  the  MINERVA  orbital  altitude  is  above  the  Mars  atmosphere,  the  main  non-
conservative  force  acting  on  the  satellites  will  simply  be  solar  radiation  pressure. 
Modeling  the  radiation pressure  effects  requires  a precise model of  the geometry  and 
material  properties  of  the  spacecraft,  together  with  a  precise  satellite  attitude 
determination. 

 
The orbit determination software developed for MGS reconstructs  the spacecraft position 
with  a  radial  accuracy  of  less  than  50 m,  and  hundreds  of meters  along-track  and  cross-
track.  This  accuracy  keeps  improving  as  the  gravity  field  model  improves  [Lemoine, 
1999]  and  much  better  results  can  be  expected  by  2008.  Furthermore,  the  orbit 
determination  accuracy  can  be  improved  by  capitalizing  on  concurrent  tracking  of 
MINERVA satellites. 

We assumed  that an orbital accuracy of  less  than  20 m  in  radial, along-track, and across-
track directions will be achievable by post-processing of the DSN tracking data measured 
over one DSN pass (ten hours) [Ely, 2000].

10.2.2.4  Satellite Clock Offset 

During  each  DSN  pass,  clock  signals  from  each  MINERVA  satellite  will  be  tracked  to 
determine  the absolute  clock offset  in  the  satellite clock and  its  first  two  time derivatives 
(satellite  clock  drift  and  clock  drift  rate).  This  information  is  necessary  to  place  the 
correct  time  tag  on  each  positioning  measurement  taken  by  MINERVA.  The  correction 
can  be  performed  either  on  Earth  or  on  each  satellite.  In  the  latter  case,  MINERVA 
simply  needs  to  regularly  upload  clock  offset,  clock  drift  and  clock  drift  rate  to 
MINERVA satellites. 

10.2.3  Position Determination Method 

This section explains  the principles of  the MINERVA positioning method. The geometry 
of the problem is summarized in Figure 10.11. 

10.2.3.1  Positioning Method Overview 

Each  MINERVA  satellite  is  equipped  with  a  UHF  communication  subsystem  to 
communicate  with  MSEs  as  described  in  section  10.1.  For  positioning  purposes,  this 
subsystem will  be  linked  to  an Ultra  Stable Oscillator  (USO)  providing  a  highly  reliable 
and predictable frequency reference. 

Each  MINERVA  satellite  at  any  instant  t  has  a  list  of  MSEs  for  which  it  is  required  to 
take positioning measurements. The USO provides the carrier for the positioning message 
at  the  specific  downlink  frequency  allocated  to  positioning.  For  each  MSE,  the 
positioning  message  is  encoded  with  the  MSE-specific  4  MHz  pseudo-random  noise 
(PSN) code, superimposed on the satellite-specific low chip rate code. 

Each MSE  is  required  to  isolate  and  retransmit  that  part  of  the  positioning  message  that 
carries  its  code.  The  retransmission  process  must  conserve  the  phase  and  multiply  the 
carrier by a specified ratio so that it fits into the positioning uplink frequency channel. 

Upon  reception,  each  satellite  isolates  its  part  of  the  message  and  isolates  each  MSE’s 
message.  Cross-correlating  each  message  with  the  relevant  MSE’s  code  provides  the 
range to that MSE. The Doppler shift of each MSE message is also measured. 

Positioning measurements can be taken as often as every five minutes (at least). They are 
stored  in  the  satellite  for  up  to  three days  carrying  a  satellite  tag,  an MSE  tag  and  a  time 
tag. 

If both orbit determination information and MSE positioning measurements are available, 
MSE positions at the times of measurement can be reconstructed. 

10.2.3.2  Two-Way Ranging 

The  range  between  two  objects  is  directly  proportional  to  the  time  it  takes  a  signal  to 
travel  between  them.  This  is  the  principle  that  radar  works  on.  In  two-way  ranging  the 
satellite  transmits  a  signal  to  the  MSE  on  the  ground.  The  transmitted  signal  carries  an 

113 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

MSE-specific code so that the data from each MSE can be isolated and treated separately. 
The MSE  retransmits  this  signal  back  to  the  satellite,  which  can  use  a  system  similar  to 
GPS  code  acquisition. The  received  signal  is  cross-correlated with  a  replica of  the  initial 
code.  If  this  code  is  pseudo-random with  a  period much  longer  than  the  transit  time,  the 
cross  product  is  negligible  unless  both  signals  are  exactly  in  phase.  The  phase  of  the 
replica  is  adjusted  until  the  amplitude  of  the  cross  product  reaches  a  peak  value.  The 
phase needed to reach this resonance is the time lag of the received signal. 

This  time  lag  is  the  sum  of  two  terms.  The  first  term  is  the  light  roundtrip  travel  time 
between  the  satellite  and  the MSE, which  is what we want  to measure;  the  second  is  the 
time  it  took  the  MSE  to  process  the  signal  and  send  it  back.  This  last  term  can  be 
predicted and automatically subtracted from the measured time. 

The range between the satellite and the MSE is then given by:

where c is the speed of light32. 

A  single  range  measurement  places  the  user  on  a  sphere  centered  on  the  satellite.  If  the 
satellite  position  with  respect  to  Mars  is  known,  the  intersection  of  the  sphere  with  the 
Mars surface can be determined. This places the user on a small circle.  

To  estimate  user  location  with  ranging  only,  MINERVA  would  need  at  least  a  second 
measurement, either from a second satellite or from the same satellite at a later time. This 
would result in a second small circle and two possible target positions. Otherwise, a third 
measurement should be taken to resolve the ambiguity. 

10.2.3.3  Doppler Ranging 

MINERVA satellites measure their Doppler shift with respect to objects on the surface of 
Mars by determining the frequency offset of the received signal with respect to the signal 
they  transmitted.  Two  methods  can  be  used  to  estimate  the  frequency  of  the  received 
signal:

32 The  time  difference  is  actually  a  measure  of  the  distance  travelled  by  light  on  a  straight  line  in  inertial 
space, which is different from the instantaneous range because of the satellite movement with respect to the 
planet.  This  slight  difference  is  easily  accounted  for  in  positioning  calculations  and  was  not  detailed  here 
for the sake of clarity.

The Doppler shift is related to the angle between the line-of-sight (LOS) from the satellite 
to the MSE and the LOS relative velocity.  If the satellite velocity is known, and the MSE 
velocity is assumed to be negligible, the angle may be determined:

The angle measurement places the user on a cone, with its apex at the satellite and its axis 
along  the  satellite  velocity.  If  the  satellite  position  with  respect  to  Mars  is  known,  the 
intersection of this cone with the Mars surface can be determined. This places the user on 
a hyperbola. 

Capitalizing  on  the  small  circle  given  by  the  range  measurement,  there  are  two  possible 
target positions. If the user position can be estimated from a previous measurement cycle, 
the  correct  intersection  point may be  identified. Otherwise,  a  third measurement must be 
taken to resolve the ambiguity.

Ambiguity Resolution 

Ambiguity  in  the  position  determination  results  from  the  instantaneous  symmetry  of  the 
positioning  problem  with  respect  to  the  satellite's  orbital  plane.  At  any  instant  t,  the 
planet,  the  ranging  sphere  and  the Doppler  cone  are  symmetric with  respect  to  this  plane 
and therefore have two symmetric intersection points on either side of the satellite ground 
track.  This  ambiguity  can  be  resolved  only  by  taking  a  new  measurement  with  different 
symmetry  characteristics.  MINERVA  will  use  three  methods  to  solve  the  ambiguity 
problem: 

1 

If the MSE's position has been estimated in a previous positioning cycle, and if it is 
known  that  this  MSE  cannot  have  traveled  the  distance  between  the  two  solution 
points, we can eliminate one of the two solutions directly. 

116

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report

The  use  of  inclined  orbits  enables  MINERVA  satellites  to  break  the  positioning 
symmetry  as  the  planet  rotates  below  the  orbital  plane.  This  situation  is  illustrated 
in  Figure  10.12  in  the  unfavorable  case  where  the  planet’s  movement  does  not 
suffice to move the MSE on to the other side of the satellite ground track. Consider 
a  planar  planet  and  let  h  be  the  distance  between  the  satellite  ground  track  and  the 
MSE.  During  a  time  ∆ t,  the  planet’s  rotation  makes  both  the  MSE  and  its 
symmetrical  point  travel  a  distance  l = RM .ω M ∆
t. cos(latitude) , which  corresponds 
to  72.1  km  displacement  on  the  equator  and  69.6  km  at  15°   latitude.  Making  the 
approximation  l ≈ 70km  at  all  latitudes,  the  distance  between  the  new  MSE’s 
symmetrical point and the displaced old symmetrical point is: 
∆ x = 2(h − h ' ) = 2 ⋅ l sin(i)  
The  ambiguity  resolution  is  thus  improved  with  increasing  orbital  inclination.  For 
27° ,  ∆ x  ≈   63  km.  As  soon  as  this  distance  is  bigger  than  the  positioning  accuracy, 
the second measurement will suffice to solve the ambiguity. 
3  When taking measurements over one entire satellite pass is not sufficient to resolve 
the  ambiguity  (MSEs  close  to  the  satellite  ground  track),  the  symmetry  will  be 
broken  with  the  next  satellite  pass.  Using  distinct  orbital  planes  improves 
ambiguity resolution.

10.2.4  Position Determination Error Estimation 

10.2.4.1  Sources of Error 

Two kinds of errors limit the accuracy of the positioning function: 

1 

2 

Random  errors, which  correspond  to  noise  in  the measurements,  and  cancel  out  as 
several measurements are taken. 
Bias errors, which correspond  to uncertain knowledge of one of  the parameters and 
will repeat over several consecutive measurements. 

 
10.2.4.1.1 

Random Error Sources 

  Two-way range measurement noise: 
Range is measured as the time it takes for signal transmitted by a MINERVA satellite 
to be received again after having been retransmitted by an MSE. The accuracy  in  this 
difference  in  time  is  limited  by  the  chip  rate  used  to  encode  the  signal.  Since  time 
delay  is  measured  by  cross-correlation  between  transmitted  and  received  signal,  the 
chip  period  limits  the  measurement  accuracy.  Communicating  at  UHF  (400  MHz), 
MINERVA can use a code bandwidth of  ν
 = 4 MHz. The resulting range accuracy is: 

σ R ≈

0.1c
ν

7.5m  

Therefore σ R = 10 m has been used in positioning accuracy calculations. 
•   Two-way Doppler shift measurement noise: 
Doppler shift is measured by determining the frequency offset of the received signal. 
Whether  it  is  done  by  taking  the  Fourier  transform  of  the  signal  or  by  counting  the 
number  of  cycles  in  a  given  time  period,  an  Ultra  Stable  Oscillator  (USO)  will  be 
used  on  board  each  MINERVA  satellite  to  generate  the  frequency  reference  for 
positioning signals. The accuracy will be limited by: 
o Integration time 

Frequency  resolution  is  improved  by  increasing  the  time  over which  the  signal  is 
integrated 33 .  As  an  example,  Table  10.9  gives  the  frequency  measurement 
stability  as  a  function  of  integration  time  for  the  USO  used  on  board  the  Mars 
Global Surveyor Spacecraft (MGS) [MGS_Reqs]. 

                                                 

33 As  the  integration  time  increases, what  is actually measured  is an average Doppler  shift  over  the  time of 
integration.  If  the MSE’s velocity  is neglected and  the  satellite orbit known,  this average Doppler  shift can 
easily be related to the MSE position. The overall positioning scheme remains the same as described. 

118

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

Typical  integration  times  for  positioning  application  range  from  100  ms  to  1 
minute. A conservative estimate of the measurement accuracy is over such a time: 
1.0 × 10 -11f = 4.10-3 Hz .34

o Satellite oscillator stability 

The Doppler  shift  is obtained by  subtracting  the  initial  frequency. Therefore both 
methods  are  limited  by  the  satellite  oscillator  stability  over  the  integration  time. 
USOs at UHF were used on  the Transit system with a frequency change over one 
satellite  pass  of  less  than  a  part  in  1011  [Leondes,  1980].  A  very  conservative 
upper  bound  on  the  frequency  offset  over  a  light  roundtrip  time  (tens  of 
milliseconds) is therefore ∆
f < 4.10-3 Hz. 

o Uplink frequency 

The  MSE  has  to  retransmit  the  satellite  signal  at  an  accurate  predefined  uplink 
frequency.  This  will  be  done  by  using  specific  components  on  all  MSEs,  which 
directly  multiply  the  incoming  frequency  by  a  specific  ratio  and  conserve  its 
phase  information  [Ely,  2000]. Therefore  the  error  added  in  the  return  link  is  just 
a ratio of the initial frequency error:

The  final Doppler measurement  accuracy  can be  expressed  in  terms of  range-rate 
accuracy: 

                                                 

34  This  consideration  is  highly  conservative  since  the  actual  behaviour  of  the  Doppler  shift  over  the 
integration  time  is  known  and  can  be  modelled  into  the  software.  Such  a  method  could  yield  much  better 
accuracy. ***

Bias Error Sources 

Bias  errors  are  errors  in  the parameters used  to  calculate  the positioning  fix. They  repeat 
over several consecutive measurements. They include: 

  Orbit determination errors 
Satellite  position  and  velocity  with  respect  to  a  Mars-fixed  coordinate  frame  are 
critical  to  the  estimation  process.  Their  accuracy  places  an  absolute  upper  bound  on 
the  positioning  accuracy.  As  explained  in  Orbit  Determination  (10.2.2),  post-
processing  of  MINERVA  orbits  should  provide  an  accuracy  σ o  =  20  m  in  all  three 
directions  (radial,  along-track,  across-track).  This  corresponds  to  a  velocity  accuracy 
of 1 cm/s in all three directions:

•   Time errors 
Once accurate orbits are determined, knowledge of the satellite’s positions at the time 
of  measurement  relies  on  precise  time  tagging  of  the  measurements.  Since  the 
satellites  travel at a velocity VS  ≈
 2 km/s,  the  time of measurement must be known  to 
less than ten milliseconds to keep the satellite position accuracy below twenty meters. 
During  each  daily  ten-hour  DSN  pass,  satellite  clocks  will  by  synchronized  with 
terrestrial reference atomic clocks. In addition, DSN will measure satellite clock drifts 
and  drift  rate  (first  and  second  derivative  of  the  satellite  clock  offset).  This 
information will  be  stored  on  board MINERVA  and  used  to  keep  the  time within  10 
ms  of  the  absolute  time  during  the  daily  14-hour  period  when  the  Earth  is  not 
available. 

  Altitude errors 
Short  term positioning by MINERVA  assumes  the user  altitude  is known  for  a  given 
latitude  and  longitude.  As  explained  in  section  10.2.1,  the  altitude  accuracy  can  be 
expected to be σ
a = 200 m. 

By  taking  measurements  over  several  satellites  passes,  the  altitude  estimate  may  be 
adjusted  to  the  value  that  provides  the  best  accuracy  in  latitude  and  longitude. 
Therefore altitude error does not limit the achievable positioning accuracy on the long

run.  It  will  however  represent  an  absolute  upper  bound  on  the  short-term  accuracy 
and be a limiting factor for quickly moving MSEs. 

  User velocity errors 
The  proposed  positioning  scheme  relies  on  a  Doppler  shift  measurement,  assuming 
the  relative velocity between  the  satellite  and  the MSE  is known. For  slowly moving 
objects,  as  most  MSEs  are,  this  velocity  is  simply  the  satellite’s  velocity.  The 
positioning  analysis  is  valid  for MSEs moving  at  less  than  1  cm/s  (assumed Doppler 
accuracy). 

For  moving  objects, 
the  Doppler  measurement  degrades 
the  accuracy  of 
proportionally  to  the object’s velocity. Moreover,  in  this case MINERVA cannot rely 
on  several  measurements  to  improve  its  positioning  accuracy.  MSEs  wanting  to 
benefit  from  the MINERVA  system  while  moving  at  significantly  more  than  1  cm/s 
will have to carry Inertial Measurement Units to estimate the direction and magnitude 
of their velocity. 

  Atmospheric delays  
Two  other  sources  of  error  encountered  by  Earth  orbiting  satellites  are  atmospheric 
and  ionospheric  delays,  which  cause  errors  in  the  range  of  meters.  These  errors  are 
respectively  proportional  to  atmospheric  and  ionospheric  densities.  Since  the  density 
of  both  the Martian  atmosphere  and  ionosphere  are  negligible with  respect  to Earth's 
densities, we can safely ignore these delays for Mars at the level of accuracy required. 

10.2.4.2  Mathematical Framework 

The  user's  position  is  obtained  by  iterating  from  an  initial  guess  using  a  weighted  least 
squares estimation35. The goal is to estimate a vector quantity x (containing longitude and 
latitude)  by  measuring  a  second  vector  quantity  y  (containing  range  and  Doppler  at 
several times) using have a theoretical model y = f(x) + noise. From a first estimation x0, 
the problem can be linearized to give: 
∆ y = H ⋅
∆ x  

where H is the Jacobian matrix for f (often called design matrix): 

H =

 ∂ x 

                                                 

35 A Kalman filter type of estimation may be better suited. This does not change the results of the following 
analysis.

10.2.4.2.1 

Error Due to Noise 

From a  stochastic model of  the noise  in  the measurements,  the  standard deviation 
n) of 
each  measurement  is  estimated.  A  weight  matrix  giving  more  importance  to  those 
measurements with  less  error  is  defined.  This matrix W  is  diagonal with  the  nth  element 
being 1/σ 2
n . 
If  ∆ y  is  the  difference  between  f(x0)  and  the  measured  value  of  y,  then  the  new  best 
estimate of x becomes:

where H(-) is called the generalized inverse for H. 

The process is integrated until convergence within available accuracy. 

With such an estimation process,  the standard deviation for  the final components of x are

Error in the Model 

Additional errors in the estimation of x result from imperfections in the model y = f(x) + 
noise.  Let  z  be  a  vector  parameter  used  in  the  model  (for  example,  the  satellite  orbital 
velocity)  and  let  the  y  =  f(x,z)  be  the  relation  between  the  parameter  value  and  the

10.2.4.3  Application to MINERVA Accuracy Estimate 

The  above  method  was  used  to  estimate  the  accuracy  of  two-dimensional  positioning 
with  MINERVA.  Satellites  orbits  were  simulated  over  four  orbital  periods.  Positioning 
accuracy  has  been  estimated  at  each  point  on  a  Martian  surface  grid  within  the  ± 15°  
latitude  band,  adding measurements  every  five minutes  over  each  satellite  pass.  Specific 
equations and corresponding MATLAB code are given in Appendix B. 

Table  10.10  summarizes  the  baseline  assumptions  and  the  main  conclusions  of  this 
analysis.

Below are the definitions for a few terms used in the rest of this section. 
•   Positioning accuracy 
In  this  discussion, measurement  accuracy  refers  to  the  standard  deviation  (1 σ )  of  the 
measurement. 
In  one  dimension,  an  accuracy  of  1σ
  is  called  linear  error  probable.  It  means  that 
68.3% of the data points will be within σ
 of the actual value. 

123 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

In two dimensions, as is the case for positioning accuracy, an accuracy of 1σ
 is called 
standard  ellipse.  It means  that 39.4% of  the data  points will be within  σ
 of  the  actual 
position, 50% within 1.18σ
, 86.5% within 2σ
, 98.2% within 3σ

The  accuracy  hereafter  given  assumes  20 m  accuracy  in MINERVA  satellites  orbital 
positions.  It  therefore  corresponds  to  a  potential  accuracy,  which  will  be  achieved 
with post-processing. 

  Time to accuracy 
The  potential  accuracy  of  the  position  estimate  improves  over  time  as  more 
measurements  are  taken.  The  time  to  accuracy  at  a  given  location  is  defined  as  the 
time  after which  the potential  accuracy  goes below  the  required value  (100 m). For  a 
slowly  moving  MSE,  this  accuracy  level  will  then  be  maintained  or  improved  with 
each additional measurement. 

The  actual  time  to  reconstruct  the MSE  position differs  from  the  time  to  accuracy.  It 
includes time to wait for ground station availability and time for orbital determination 
post-processing. 

  Maximum, minimum and average time to accuracy 
The  time  to  reach  accuracy  at  a  given point on Mars depends on  the planet’s  angular 
phase  with  respect  to  the  MINERVA  constellation.  The  exact  same  constellation 
geometry  observed  by  an  MSE  at  a  certain  time  will  be  observed  at  a  different 
longitude later on. 

Therefore  maximum,  minimum  and  average  time  to  accuracy  are  defined  for  any 
given latitude as maximum, minimum and average time over all longitudes. 

  Average accuracy over time 
Similarly,  the  average  accuracy  at  any  given  time  is  the  accuracy  averaged  over  all 
longitudes for a given latitude. 

10.2.4.3.1 

Positioning Accuracy versus Orbital Parameters 

Positioning  performance  improves  as  the  variety  of  satellite  pass  geometries 
increases.  This  corresponds  to  taking  measurements  from  several  viewpoints.  For  a 
given constellation, the achievable positioning accuracy is a function of MSE latitude. 
From  a  positioning  viewpoint,  the  constellation  architecture  is  considered  optimal  if 
minimizes the maximum time to accuracy over the ± 15°  latitude band. 

  Orbital altitude 
Accuracy  of  positioning  by  range  measurement  usually  increases  with  increasing 
orbital altitude because the same range error has relatively less effect if the total range 
is  increased.  On  the  other  hand,  the  accuracy  of  positioning  with  Doppler  shift 
measurement  improves  with  decreasing  altitude,  which  corresponds  to  increasing 

124

orbital  velocity.  The  choice  to  use  both methods  concurrently makes  the MINERVA 
system instantaneous positioning performance almost independent of orbital altitude. 

The main  effect  of  orbital  altitude  on  positioning  is  linked  to  coverage  performance: 
as coverage time over an MSE increases, more measurements can be taken. 

  Orbital inclination 
A way of achieving satellite pass variety is to increase the orbital inclination. On the 
°  latitude band degrades with 
± 15°
other hand, coverage performance over the ±
increasing orbital inclination, meaning that fewer measurements can be taken over 
a given area. This trade was the main driver for the choice of orbital inclination. 27°
°  
was identified as the optimal orbital inclination as illustrated by 

Figure 10.13 and Figure 10.14. 
This  result  is  due  to  coverage  performance.  27°   corresponds  to  the  highest  possible 
inclination  for which  a  satellite  can  reach  both  edges  of  the  ± 15°   latitude  band  at  all 
times. The maximum revisit time increases dramatically if the inclination exceeds this 
threshold.

  Number of orbital planes 
Using two distinct orbital planes improves the variety of satellite pass geometries and 
facilitates ambiguity resolution.  

10.2.4.3.2  MINERVA Positioning Performance 

Figure 10.15 illustrates how accuracy improves over time due to two factors. 

The  error  due  to  measurement  noise  is  to  first  order  inversely  proportional  to  the 
square  root of  the number of measurements. This  factor actually plays a minor role 
because  measurement  errors  are  negligible  compared  to  errors  due  to  orbital  and 
altitude knowledge errors. 
The  variety  of  viewpoints  improves  when  more  measurements  are  taken.  This 
effect  is  very  slight  over  one  satellite  pass  but  improves  the  accuracy  significantly 
each  time  a  new  satellite  comes  into  view.  The  main  effect  of  each  new  satellite 
pass is to help correcting the error related to MSE altitude estimate.

Figure 10.15: Average Accuracy as a Function of Time 

 

 

The position of an MSE  is determined with  respect  to  the MINERVA  constellation. This 
is  inherent  to  satellite  positioning.  Therefore  the  accuracy  of  MINERVA  satellites’ 
positions  represents  the  best  achievable  positioning  accuracy.  As  illustrated  by  Figure 
10.15,  the  accuracy  will  not  improve  beyond  an  asymptotic  value  even  with  an  infinite 
number of measurements. 

Positioning performance  is  a  function MSE  latitude  and  is  symmetric with  respect  to  the 
equator.  The  line  of  sight  between  an MSE  and  a  satellite  travels  over  a  wider  range  of 
directions  for  MSEs  located  near  the  equator.  The  positioning  accuracy  thus  improves 
with  decreasing  MSE  latitude.  Conversely,  the  time  to  reach  100  m  accuracy  is  lowest 
around the equator. 

 

Figure  10.13  shows  that  the  maximum  time  to  accuracy  can  be  greater  than  three  hours 
for  latitudes  above  12° .  Figure  10.16  and  Figure  10.17  give  the  probability  to  reach 
accuracy  within  a  certain  time  for  the  locations  of  best  (0 °   latitude)  and  worst  (15°  
latitude)  positioning  performance.  It  shows  that  the  probability  for  an  MSE  to  require 
more than three hours of measurement data to reach accuracy will always be smaller than 
30%.  Since  the  positioning  geometry  rotates  with  the  planet,  this  means  that  ‘good 
geometries’ will occur more than 70% of the time at each surface location.

10.3  Communication and Position Determination Hardware Summary 

Table 10.11  summarizes  the physical  characteristics of  all  the payload hardware used on 
each  MINERVA  satellite.  It  also  lists  the  assumptions  made  to  estimate  payload  mass. 
Existing  components  were  taken  as  baseline  wherever  possible.  Where  necessary, 
approximations  are  based  on  MIT  faculty’s  expertise  [Staelin,  2000]  and  kept 
conservative. 

For  a  total  RF  output  power  of  around  165  W,  the  payload  will  use  three  solid-state 
power amplifiers of 55 W each. These amplifiers will be shared among  the  three  types of 
links and each will weight around 2.2 kg (see SMAD, Figure 13-15).

10.4  Computer Hardware 

The flight computer of a modern spacecraft is a very important component. It controls the 
spacecraft  functions  and  must  therefore  be  extremely  reliable.  It  must  be  radiation 
hardened  to  survive  in  the  harsh  environment  of  space.  In  case  of  failure,  it must  have  a 
back-up  system.  It  also  connects  to  all  the  other  sensors  and  actuators  on  the  spacecraft, 
acting as the central brain. 

The  following  definitions  will  come  in  handy  in  the  next  sections  (for  those  readers 
unfamiliar with computer terminology) [AOL, 2000]: 

Random Access Memory (RAM) 

In common usage, the term RAM is synonymous with main memory, the memory 
available  to  programs.  One  type  of  RAM  is  dynamic  random  access  memory 
(DRAM).  Dynamic  RAM  needs  to  be  refreshed  thousands  of  times  per  second. 
RAM  is  volatile  memory,  meaning  that  it  loses  its  contents  when  the  power  is 
turned off. 

Read-Only Memory (ROM) 

Computer  memory  on  which  data  has  been  prerecorded.  Once  data  has  been 
written  onto  a  ROM  chip,  it  cannot  be  removed  and  can  only  be  read.  ROM  is 
non-volatile memory, meaning  that  it retains  its contents even when  the computer 
is turned off. 

Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM) 

EEPROM is a special type of programmable ROM that can be erased by exposing 
it  to  an  electrical  charge.  EEPROM  retains  its  contents  even  when  the  power  is 
turned  off.  EEPROM  is  similar  to  flash  memory  (sometimes  called  flash 
EEPROM).  The  principal  difference  is  that  EEPROM  requires  data  to  be  written 
or  erased  one  byte  at  a  time  whereas  flash  memory  allows  data  to  be  written  or 
erased in blocks. This makes flash memory faster. 

10.4.1  Main Processor 

The RAD 6000 computer was chosen as the flight computer for the MINERVA satellites. 
It  is  a  radiation  hardened  IBM  Risc  6000  Single  Chip  CPU.  Lockeed-Martin  Federal 
Systems  developed  this  radiation-hardened  version  of  the  IBM  R6000  [Mars_FAQ, 
2000].  It  was  chosen  for  its  proven  reliability  on  missions  such  as  Mars  Pathfinder, 
Globalstar,  and  SBIRS  Low  SMAD.  Two  identical  RAD6000  computers  will  be  flown 
(two-for-one  redundancy),  with  one  acting  as  a  back-up  that  can  handle  all  of  the 
functions  of  the  primary  computer.  Table  10.12  shows  the  characteristics  of  the  RAD 
6000.

In  section  10.5.2,  the  required  memory  and  throughput  for  the  flight  software  was 
estimated  to  be  a maximum  of  8 MB  and  5 MIPS,  respectively.  From  the  table  above,  it 
can be seen that the RAD 6000 exceeds the requirements of our software. 

The MINERVA system  is designed  to hold up  to  three days of data  from  the MSE  in  the 
case of DSN downtime when data  cannot be  transmitted. The  requirement of our  system 
is  to  transmit  10  Gb/sol.  Therefore,  we  must  be  able  to  hold  up  to  30  Gb  of  data  in 
memory. Note  that  this 30 Gb capacity has been divided among  the satellites. Since each 
satellite  can  hold  roughly  15  Gb  of  data,  at  least  two  satellites  are  required  to  meet  the 
data  holding  requirement  of  30  Gb.  During  nominal  operations,  this  memory  acts  as  a 
holding buffer in which to hold data until a receipt confirmation from Earth is received. 

10.4.2  Computer Hardware Fault Tolerance and Reliability 

As  mentioned  in  section  10.4.1,  two-for-one  redundancy  will  be  used  for  the  flight 
computer. Two  identical processors will be available. One will act as  the main processor, 
with the backup processor taking over when necessary. 

Error detection and correction  (EDAC) circuitry will be  included  to  reduce  the chance of 
failure  due  to  single  event  upsets  (SEU).  Watch  dog  timers  will  be  used  to  restart  the 
computer  when  problems  occur.  Watchdog  timers  are  special  circuits  that  count  down 
from a predetermined time. Anomalous computer operation would prevent the timer from 
being reset. If the timer is not reset by the computer before the time is up, the computer is 
reset  [Wertz,  1999].  This  helps  alleviate  problems  with  computer  hang-ups.  Also, 
scrubbing  programs  will  be  used  to  correct  single  bit  errors  [Wertz,  1999].  The  critical 
flight  software  will  be  duplicated  in  physically  isolated  sections  of  the  non-volatile

memory.  This  reduces  the  chances  of  the  loss  of  a  spacecraft  due  to  software  failure 
[Wertz, 1999]. 

10.5  Software37 

Software  is  an  important  part  of  modern  space  missions.  In  recent  times,  the  concept  of 
highly  autonomous  spacecraft  has  become  very  popular  as  a  way  to  decrease  mission 
operations  costs.  However,  autonomy  software  is  complex,  expensive  to  develop,  and 
difficult to test. 

This  section  describes  the method  used  to  estimate  the  size  of  the  flight  software.  It  also 
describes the trade made between spacecraft autonomy, high software development costs, 
and mission operations costs. 

Three distinct categories of software were identified: 

1)  Flight Software 

This is the software that actually resides on the spacecraft. 

2)  Test, Integration, and Simulation Software 

This  includes  software  that  is  used  to  verify  the  flight  software,  and  any  updates 
to  the  flight  software.  It  is  also  used  by  systems  engineers  to  aid  in  anomaly 
resolution during operations. This software resides on the ground. 

3)  Operations Software 

This  is  the  software  used  by  the  mission  operators  to  control  and  monitor  the 
spacecraft. Operations software includes many different software packages, which 
may  be  commercial-off-the-shelf  (COTS)  or  developed  in-house.  Some  may  be 
used  on-line  for  real-time  operations,  and  some may  be  used  off-line  for  analysis 
or planning. These  software packages  are used  for  several different  types  of  jobs, 
including [Wertz, 1999]: 

Mission  &  Activity  Planning  -  Aids  in  management  of  MINERVA 
resources,  including  user  resource  allocation,  scheduling  of  MINERVA 
maintenance,  and  other  mission  consumables.  This  software  is  mostly  used 
off-line. 

Mission  Control  -  Aids  mission  controllers  in  real-time  monitoring  and 
commanding of spacecraft.  

Navigation  and  Orbit Control  - Determines  the position  and velocity of  the 
MINERVA satellites; aids  in design of  trajectories and maneuvers. Due  to  the

large  distances  between  Earth  and  the  MINERVA  system,  this  software  is 
used off-line. 

Spacecraft  Operations  -  Helps  monitor  the  health  and  performance  of  the 
spacecraft. It also helps to analyze anomalies. This is used off-line. 

Data  Delivery,  Processing,  and  Archiving  -  Manages  the  data  flow  from 
MINERVA,  including  system  engineering  data  from  the  satellites  and  MSE 
user data. This  includes delivery of  the data  to  the proper users on Earth, pre-
processing  of  engineering  data  before  it  is  sent  to  the  system  engineers,  and 
archiving of all data. 

In  the  following sections,  the size and cost of  the MINERVA software will be estimated. 
The  computer  requirements  of  the  flight  software  will  also  be  estimated.  The  computer 
requirements  will  be  in  the  form  of  memory  and  throughput  requirements.  These  are 
defined below [Wertz, 1999]: 

Memory  -  Size  of  the  software  in  Kilowords  or  megabytes  (MB).  The  flight 
computer must have enough memory to hold the flight software. 

Throughput  – A measure  of  the  processing  time  required  by  the  flight  software. 
This  is  measured  in  units  of  "thousands  of  instructions  per  second  (KIPS)"  or 
"millions  of  instructions  per  second  (MIPS)."  One  measure  of  computer 
performance is the number of MIPS processed. 

 

10.5.1  Flight Software Size Estimation 

The  MINERVA  flight  software  was  planned  used  the  technique  of  "estimation  by 
similarity"  described  in  SMAD  Chapter  16.  The  idea  of  this  technique  is  to  look  at  the 
frequency  of  execution,  memory  requirements,  and  throughput  of  certain  typical 
spacecraft  functions  and  to  estimate  the  size  of  similar  functions  from  this  data.  The 
number  of  source  lines  of  code  (SLOC)  for  the  flight  software  are  then  estimated.  From 
the number of SLOC, a cost is estimated as shown in section 10.5.4. 

In order to estimate the flight software, the main functions of the flight computer are first 
defined. Table 10.13 shows the general functions of a MINERVA satellite.

Two trades were studies for the flight software. 

The  first  trade was  the programming  language. Only C  and Ada were  considered  for our 
software,  as  these  are  the  most  widely  used  languages  used  on  deep  space  and  science 
missions [Fesq, 2000]. 

The  second  trade  was  between  different  levels  of  autonomy.  The  next  section  describes 
the three different levels of flight software autonomy that were considered. 

10.5.1.1  Flight Software Autonomy 

Three levels of autonomy were explored for the flight software: 

Table 10.14: Possible Flight Software Autonomy Levels 

Autonomy Level  

Description 

1 

2 

3 

Highly Autonomous 

Partially Autonomous 

Minimally Autonomous 

 

Note  that  some  autonomy  will  be  necessary  due  to  the  large  communications  latency 
between Earth and Mars. The capabilities of each computer function are described below 
for each level of autonomy. 

1)  MSE Position Fixing 

Autonomy Level 1 -- Highly Autonomous Spacecraft 

When  an MSE  has  landed,  the EGS  can  send  a  simple  command  to MINERVA  to  “find 
the  new  MSE”.  MINERVA  will  then  initiate  a  search.  If  the  MSE  is  able  to  respond, 

135 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

MINERVA  will  collect  the  necessary  radiometric  data  and  compute  the  position  of  the 
MSE. The MSE will be  provided with  its  location,  and  the  radiometric data  and position 
of  the MSE will  be  sent  to  the EGS.  If  the MINERVA  system  has  proven  to  be  reliable, 
the  radiometric  data  could  be  sent  back  to  Earth  only  if  MINERVA  detects  a  possible 
error, or on request. 

Once  MINERVA  has  tracked  the  new  MSE,  it  stores  the  last  calculated  position  in 
memory.  It  then  determines  when  the  next  possible  contact  will  occur.  During  each 
possible  contact,  MINERVA  will  search  for  the  MSE,  and  ask  if  it  needs  a  position 
update.  It  will  also  be  possible  for  Earth  operators  to  direct  MINERVA  to  search  in 
certain locations on Mars if an error is detected. 

Autonomy Level 2 -- Partially Autonomous Spacecraft 

MINERVA  will  not  store  the  positions  of  the  MSEs  in  memory  and  will  not  determine 
the  next  possible  contact  for  the  MSEs.  Instead,  each  MINERVA  satellite  will 
continuously  send  out  a  ping  message  to  alert  MSEs  when  a  satellite  is  overhead.  This 
will allow autonomous MSEs to initiate a position fix when the system is available. 

When  an MSE  has  landed,  the EGS  can  send  a  simple  command  to MINERVA  to  “find 
the  new  MSE”.  MINERVA  will  then  initiate  a  search.  If  the  MSE  is  able  to  respond, 
MINERVA will collect the necessary radiometric data and send it to Earth for processing. 

Position fixes will be initiated from the EGS. The EGS will command MINERVA to find 
a  position  fix  for  a  given  set  of  MSEs  (each  MSE  will  have  a  predefined,  unique 
identifier).  Along  with  this  command,  the  EGS  will  send  updated  MINERVA  satellite 
position  information.  The  EGS  may  also  send  estimated  positions  for  the  MSEs.  On 
receiving  this  command,  each  satellite will  search  for  the  given MSEs. When  an MSE  is 
found,  the position determination process will begin. As soon as enough radiometric data 
has  been  recorded,  the  positions  of  the  MSEs  will  be  calculated  on-board  the  satellites. 
This position information will be sent to the EGS and the MSE if this is commanded. The 
radiometric  data may  also  be  sent  to  the  EGS  if  commanded.  It will  still  be  possible  for 
Earth  operators  to  direct MINERVA  to  search  in  certain  locations  on Mars  if  an  error  is 
detected.  Note  that  the  position  fix  commands  could  be  uploaded  in  the  form  of 
timetables  for  each  satellite.  These  tables  would  tell  each  satellite  when  to  look  for  a 
given MSE and when to provide a position fix. 

Autonomy Level 3 -- Minimally Autonomous Spacecraft 

When  an MSE  has  landed,  the EGS  can  send  a  simple  command  to MINERVA  to  “find 
the  new  MSE”.  MINERVA  will  then  initiate  a  search.  If  the  MSE  is  able  to  respond, 
MINERVA  will  collect  the  necessary  radiometric  data  and  send  it  to  the  EGS  for 
processing. 

The  EGS  will  initiate  a  position  fix  for  an  MSE.  MINERVA  will  send  the  recorded 
radiometric data back  to  the EGS. The actual position fixing calculations will be done on 
Earth. The EGS may send a  timetable of when and where each satellite should  look for a 
given MSE. 

136 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

2)  Communications 

Autonomy Level 1 -- Highly Autonomous Spacecraft 

When  the  EGS  wishes  to  communicate  with  an  MSE,  it  will  send  the  message  to 
MINERVA  and  tell  it which MSE  it  should  go  to.  Since MINERVA will  always  have  a 
good  indication  of  where  the  MSE  is  located,  it  will  then  be  able  to  determine  which 
satellite will be  the best  to send  the message. Note  that  this may  require  that  the message 
be passed via cross-link to the satellite in view of the MSE. 

When  an  MSE  wants  to  communicate  with  another  MSE  or  the  EGS,  it  will  send  a 
request message  to MINERVA. This  request message will  include  the  amount  of  data  to 
be  sent  and  its  final  destination.  Once  MINERVA  receives  the  request  message,  it  will 
collect the message from the MSE and send it to its final destination. If the MSE wants to 
communicate  with  another MSE, MINERVA  will  send  a  copy  of  the  message  to  Earth. 
This  may  also  require  the MSE  message  to  be  transmitted  via  cross-link  to  a  satellite  in 
view of the Earth. 

For  both  of  these  processes, MINERVA  will  determine  the  best  data  rate  to  use.  It  will 
also  allocate  a  given  amount  of memory  for  each MSE,  depending  on  the  expected  data 
volume. 

MINERVA will  actively  listen  for  signals  from both  the EGS  and  the MSEs.  If  the EGS 
wishes  to  update  the  MINERVA  software  or  send  a  command  to  MINERVA,  the 
message  is  labeled  as  a MINERVA message. Each  satellite will have  a unique  identifier, 
so commands can be sent to a particular satellite if desired. If the desired satellite is not in 
view  of  Earth,  the  receiving  satellite  will  pass  the  message  via  cross-link  to  the  correct 
satellite. 

If one of  the  satellites goes  into  a  safe mode,  it will be  able  to  tell Earth  about  it directly 
or via cross-link. 

Autonomy Level 2 -- Partially Autonomous Spacecraft 

When  the  EGS  wishes  to  communicate  with  an  MSE,  it  will  send  the  message  to 
MINERVA.  It will also  tell MINERVA which satellite should send  the message, at what 
time,  and  to which MSE.  For  example,  if  the EGS wishes  to  communicate with  an MSE 
that  is  out-of-view  of  Earth,  it must  first  contact  a  satellite  that  is  in  view.  Then,  it must 
tell  the  satellite  in  view  which  satellite  to  cross-link  the  message  to,  and  which  satellite 
should send the message to the MSE. 

MINERVA  will  send  the  message  until  a  receipt  confirmation  is  received,  which  it  will 
relay  to  the  EGS.  If  no  receipt  confirmation  is  received  in  a  preset  amount  of  time, 
MINERVA will inform the EGS and await further instructions. 

If  the  EGS  does  not  know  where  an  MSE  is  located,  it  will  send  the  message  to 
MINERVA  and  tell  it which MSE  it  should  go  to. MINERVA will  then  initiate  a  search 
where  each  satellite  pings  for  the  specified  MSE.  When  one  of  the  satellites  finds  the 

137 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

MSE,  it  alerts  the  other  satellites  and  sends  the  message  to  the  MSE.  A  confirmation 
message  is  then  sent  to  Earth. Note  that  this may  require  that  the message  be  passed  via 
cross-link to the satellite in view of the MSE. 

When  an MSE wants  to  talk  to  the  EGS  or  another MSE, MINERVA  will  use  the  same 
process  of  pinging  for  the  final  destination.  If  one  of  the  satellites  is  already  in  contact 
with the EGS, MINERVA will be able to detect this. 

For  all  communications  processes, MINERVA must be  told what data  rate  to use,  else  it 
will use a default setting. 

Autonomy Level 3 -- Minimally Autonomous Spacecraft 

Same as Autonomy Level 2. 

 

3)  Guidance, Navigation, and Control 

Autonomy Level 1 -- Highly Autonomous Spacecraft 

Each  satellite  will  be  able  to  find  its  own  position  around  Mars  with  an  accuracy  of  at 
least 100 m. The satellites will work  together using  radiometric data  from DSN and  their 
own  cross-links  to determine  their positions. VLBI on Earth will be used  to  augment  the 
on-board position fixing. Once an accurate fix  is found, an on-board, high precision orbit 
propagator  will  allow  the  satellite  to  accurately  estimate  its  position  until  the  next 
precision fix is available. 

Autonomy Level 2 -- Partially Autonomous Spacecraft 

The  position  fixing  of  the  satellites  will  be  done  on  Earth  using  the  DSN.  An  on-board, 
low  precision  orbit  propagator  will  allow  the  satellites  to  know  their  position  within 
1 km,  given  an  initial  starting  point  as  a  reference.  Earth  will  provide  accurate  satellite 
positioning as uplinked ephemeris data. 

Autonomy Level 3 -- Minimally Autonomous Spacecraft 

Same as Autonomy Level 2. 

4)  Attitude Determination and Control 

All Autonomy Levels 

The  attitude  of  each  spacecraft will  be  controlled  autonomously  on-board.  Each  satellite 
will  have  a  nominal  attitude where  the UHF  antenna  points  towards Mars,  the  cross-link 
antennas  point  toward  the  satellites  ahead  and  behind,  the  Earth-Mars  antenna  points 
towards  Earth,  and  the  solar  arrays  are  kept  in  the  best  attitude  for  power  generation, 
given the antennae directions. 

138 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

When  a  satellite  is  in  safe mode,  the  attitude will  be  controlled  such  that  solar  arrays  are 
in  the  best  position  for  power  generation.  Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  safe  mode, 
either  the Earth-Mars  antenna will be pointed  to Earth, or  the  cross-link  antennas will be 
pointed to another satellite (for failure of the main Earth-Mars antenna). 

 

5)  Routine Housekeeping 

All Autonomy Levels 

Routine  housekeeping  will  be  done  autonomously.  Spacecraft  momentum  will  be 
monitored  and  dumped  via  momentum  wheel  de-spins  with  attitude  thruster  burns.  The 
spacecraft  will  also  manage  on-board  power  consumption,  thermal  control,  and  data 
recording. This will  include  reserving  a memory margin  to  guarantee  that  some memory 
is available for emergency messages from MSEs or from the MINERVA system itself. 

6)  System Monitoring and Safe Moding 

All Autonomy Levels 

MINERVA will be  able  to monitor  its own  systems. Major  anomalies will be predefined 
on  Earth. When  any  of  these  anomalies  are  detected,  the  occurrence  will  be  recorded  as 
part of  the engineering data and sent  to Earth at predetermined  times or on request. Also, 
during  the  check-out  period,  MINERVA  will  record  data  on  the  functioning  of  its 
components  for  Earth  operators  to  verify.  Data  on  the  nominal  functioning  of  all  of  the 
instruments will be saved  for a set amount of  time before being overwritten. The data on 
the nominal functioning of the instruments will only be sent to Earth on request or when a 
safe mode is entered. 

MINERVA  will  be  able  to  recognize  potential  life  threatening  anomalies  and  put  itself 
into  the  proper  safe  mode.  MINERVA  will  have  a  given  number  of  safe  modes.  Some 
safe modes will still allow parts of the satellite to interact with the others, while other safe 
modes may completely take the satellite off-line to await instructions from Earth. 

Refer also to section 14.2.

7)  Operating System 

All Autonomy Levels

 

The operating system will not be affected greatly by the level of autonomy. However, the 
size of the operating system will depend on the size of the other computer functions.

10.5.1.2  Flight Computer Functions 

Several  subfunctions  are  necessary  to  complete  the  primary  functions  listed  in  Table 
10.13.  The  subfunctions  will  depend  on  what  each  function  is  to  accomplish  and  how 
much autonomy is necessary. 

The  function  models  that  were  used  to  estimate  the  size  of  the  flight  software  are 
described  below  for  each  autonomy  level.  This  includes  estimates  for  the  size, 
throughput, memory,  I/O  device  handlers,  and  data  sources  for  each  function. All  of  the

Operating System 

Once  requirements  for  each  of  the  functions  are  estimated,  the  size  of  the  operating 
system  (O/S)  can  be  estimated.  The  estimated  total  requirements  for  each  function  are 
summarized in Table 10.39.

There are five main functions of the O/S, as shown in Table 10.40: 

Table 10.40: Operating System Functions 

1) Executive 

2) Run-Time Kernel 

3) I/O Device Handlers 
 

1) Executive 

4) Built-In Test and Diagnostics 

5) Math Utilities 

 

The  executive  "manages  and  schedules  the  application  software  and  other  operating-
system  functions."  [Wertz,  1999]  The  required  memory  for  the  executive  is  taken  from 
SMAD  Table  16-15  and  is  shown  in  Table  10.42.  The  required  throughput  for  the 
executive is related to the number of tasks scheduled per second. 

The  number  of  tasks  scheduled  per  second  can  be  estimated  by  first  finding  the  total 
number of functions performed per second. It is then assumed that each function has four 
tasks  (see  SMAD,  p.  657).  The  frequency  of  each  function  can  be  interpreted  as  the 
number of functions per second. 

154 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

Thus, the total number of functions per second for each function listed in Table 10.40 can 
be found by summing the frequencies of the subfunction components, and multiplying by 
four: 
Tasks Scheduled ≈ 4 ∑ f
Second

where f = frequency of subfunction i 

i  

The  total  number  of  functions  per  second  for  each  autonomy  level  are  given  in  Table 
10.39. The number of tasks scheduled per second is given in Table 10.41: 

Table 10.41: Number of Tasks Scheduled per Second 

Autonomy Level 1 

Autonomy Level 2 

Autonomy Level 3 

1174.44 

670.44 

670.44 

 

The required throughput for the executive can now be estimated by SMAD: 

 Tasks Scheduled 
Required Throughput for O/S Executive ≈ 0.3 
  
Second



The required throughput for the executive is shown Table 10.42. 

2) Run-Time Kernel 

The  run-time kernel  "supports higher-order  languages."  [Wertz, 1999]. For our purposes, 
the  run-time  kernel  will  be  purchased  as  a  commercial-off-the-shelf  (COTS)  item.  This 
means  that  money  will  not  need  to  be  spent  developing  the  run-time  kernel.  While  this 
will  save  some money,  it  should be noted  that  the  run-time kernel  is a very  small portion 
of the overall flight software. The memory requirements for the run-time kernel are taken 
from Table 16-15 from SMAD and are shown in Table 10.42. The throughput for the run-
time  kernel  is  assumed  to  be  included  in  the  throughput  estimate  for  the  other  software 
functions [Wertz, 1999]. 

3) I/O Device Handlers 

The  I/O handler "controls data movement  to and  from  the processor"  [Wertz, 1999]. The 
device handler (or device driver) "manages interfaces and data between the processor and 
any peripheral devices" [Wertz, 1999]. These two related functions are estimated together 
as the I/O device handlers. 

155 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

The memory requirements of the I/O device handlers can be estimated from the values in 
Table  16-15  in  SMAD.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  these  are  the  memory 
requirements  for  each  I/O  device  handler.  It  is  therefore  necessary  to  estimate  the  total 
number of I/O device handlers for the system. 

It  is  assumed  that  portions  of  the  I/O  device  handler  code  can  be  reused  in  some  cases. 
For  example,  if  there  are  three  rate  gyros,  then  three  I/O  handlers  are  necessary. 
However, each of these I/O handlers is assumed to be identical. This means that three I/O 
handlers  reside  on  the  computer,  but  only  one  piece  of  code  needs  to  be  developed.  So, 
we will need to estimate the actual I/O handler code size to make sure the flight computer 
can hold it, and the actual code size that needs to be developed. This will be referred to as 
the “software to be developed”. 

In order  to estimate  the  throughput for  the  I/O device handlers,  the number of data words 
handled per second for each function must be estimated. This  is a measure of  the amount 
of data handled by the I/O device handlers. These numbers are mostly independent of the 
level of autonomy in the system.  

The  total  number  of  I/O  device  handlers  and  number  of  data  words  handled  per  second 
were  estimated  above  for  each  flight  computer  function. The  required  throughput  for  the 
I/O device handlers is given by SMAD: 

 Data Words Handled 
Required Throughput for I/O Device Handlers ≈ 0.05 
  
Second



The  required  memory  and  throughput  for  the  I/O  device  handlers  are  shown  in  Table 
10.42. 

4) Built-In Test and Diagnostics 

Built-in  test  software  “provides  testing  for  computer  elements  under  the  control  of 
software”  [Wertz,  1999].  Diagnostic  software  identifies  and  isolates  faults  and  failures. 
The  memory  and  throughput  requirements  are  taken  from  SMAD  Table  16-15  and  are 
shown in Table 10.42. 

5) Math Utilities 

Math  utilities  are  mathematical  operations  provided  by  the  operating  system  that  can  be 
accessed  by  several  applications.  The  memory  for  the  math  utilities  are  taken  from 
SMAD Table 16-15 and are shown in Table 10.42.

Once we have the memory estimates, we can estimate the number of source lines of code 
(SLOC).  The  SLOC  will  depend  on  the  programming  language  used.  For  costing 
purposes,  the  data  words  are  converted  to  equivalent  code  words  by  using  a  factor  of 
0.25.  This  assumes  that  data  word  development  takes  one  quarter  of  the  effort  of  code 
word development [Wertz, 1999]. 
Equivalent Code Words = Code Words + 0.25 (

Data Words  

Dividing  the  equivalent  code  words  by  the  number  of  assembly  instructions  per  SLOC 
gives the SLOC estimate [Wertz, 1999]. 

SLOC ≈

Equivalent Code Words
Assembly Instructions per SLOC

 

The  number  of  assembly  instructions  per  SLOC  depends  on  the  programming  language 
used. 

Once  the  SLOC  is  found,  it  can  be  converted  into  bytes.  This  conversion  factor  also 
depends  on  the  programming  language.  This  formula  will  be  used  in  the  next  section  to 
calculate the flight software computer requirements.

10.5.2  Flight Software Computer Requirements 

The  flight  computer must  be  capable  of  running  and  storing  the  actual  flight  software.  It 
has  just  been  shown  that  it  is  possible  to  estimate  the  software  requirements.  However, 
because  changing  hardware  late  in  the  development  phase  can  increase  mission  cost,  a 
margin  is  added  to  the  software  requirements.  This  is  done  to  make  sure  that  the  flight 
computer  will  have  enough  speed  and  memory  to  run  the  flight  software,  even  if 
requirements  creep  cause  the  software  to  grow  larger  than  initially  estimated  when  the 
computer  was  chosen.  A  good  estimate  on  the  software  requirements  ensures  that  the 
flight  computer  will  not  have  to  be  upgraded  or  replaced  with  a  more  capable  unit. 
Because  the  requirements of  the COTS  software  are known, no margin  is  added.  For  the 
current  software  estimate,  the  only  COTS  software  is  the  run-time  kernel  (see  previous 
section). The margin is 100% of the non-COTS estimated software requirements. 

To account for on-orbit growth of the flight software, a margin is added for on-orbit spare 
computer  capability.  This  extra  margin  allows  possible  future  upgrades  to  the  software 
after  launch.  The  on-orbit  spare  is  100%  of  the  initial  estimated  requirements  plus  the 
100%  margin.  Essentially,  the  initial  software  requirements  are  multiplied  by  four  to 
allow for requirements creep and on-orbit growth. 

Table  10.48  and  Table  10.49  show  the  sizes  of  the margin  and  on-orbit  spare. Note  that 
this  margin  is  not  used  for  flight  software  cost  estimation;  only  to  size  the  flight 
computer.

10.5.3  Ground Software Size Estimation 

The  ground  software  includes  the  test,  integration,  and  simulation  software  and  the 
operations software. Estimation techniques for the ground software were not available for 
the  software  design.  Therefore,  each  of  the  two  segments  of  the  ground  software  was 
assumed  to be  four  times  the  size of  the  flight  software. The  logic behind  this decision  is 
given below. 

10.5.3.1  Test, Integration, and Simulation Software 

The  test,  integration,  and  simulation  software  is  typically  between  two  to  four  times  the 
size of the flight software [Hansen, 2000]. This size will depend on how much simulation 
and  testing  is  done  to  verify  the  flight  software.  A  reasonable  rough  order  of magnitude 
estimated  can be  found by  assuming  the  test,  integration,  and  simulation  software  is  four 
times  the  size  of  the  flight  software.  The  following  reasoning  is  quoted  from  a  personal 
email with L. Jane Hansen of HRP Systems, and co-author of Chapter 16 in SMAD. This 
information is very useful and is included with the permission Ms. Hansen. 

"To  verify  on-board  algorithms  for  navigation,  orbit  control,  attitude  control,  etc. 
you  should  have  reasonably  high  fidelity  orbit  propagator  into  which  the 
algorithms  under  development  can  be  inserted.  None  of  this  software  is  flight 
worthy  -  it  is  all  prototype  software.  The  orbit  propagator  can  be  purchased  as 
COTS  from a number of  suppliers but  inserting  your navigation or ACS  software 
modules  may  be  more  complex.  The  propagator  should  have  environmental 
models  that are  an order of magnitude better  than what  the FSW  (flight  software) 
is trying to achieve.  

"As  avionics  integration proceeds  throughout  the program,  and  especially  if  there 
exist  a  large  number  of  different  interfaces  and  thus  different  I/O  handlers  in  the 
FSW,  ground  software  simulating  the  various  subsystems  can  be  used  to  test  the 
FSW  as  it  resides  in  the  flight  computer.  This  simulation  system  will  need  an 
‘executive’  which  is  similar  in  complexity  and  SLOC  count  as  an  executive  for 
FSW  would  be.  There  needs  to  be  a  dynamic  model  of  the  ‘vehicle’  -  a  6  DOF 
representation of  the spacecraft which can be as  large  (in  terms of SLOCS) as  the 
basic  application  software  within  the  FSW  count.  So  we  are  at  approximately  1 
time the FSW SLOC count. 

"You  also  need  I/O  handlers  for  the  external  units  (like  the  rate  gyros)  to  send 
data  to  the  flight  computer  over  the  actual  network  interface.  This  would  be 
comparable  to  the  size,  complexity,  and  SLOC  count  for  the  FSW.  However,  in 
addition  to  the  I/O  handler  you  probably  want  to  model  (at  some  level)  the 
functionality behind the external units data output. In the case of the rate gyro you 
would  not  need  to  ‘re-create’  the  physical  gyro  but  rather  the  functions  and  state 
transitions  the  gyro  may  go  through  with  the  associated  performance  (if 
performance  decreases  during  high  Gs  -  etc.)  You  can  use  the  dynamic  6  DOF 
model  of  the  spacecraft  to  provide  truth  about  the  gyro  elements  (velocity  and 
acceleration)  but 
then  add  on  errors  based  on 
the  unit's  performance 

166 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

specifications. This  is  additional  to  the  SLOC  count  for  the  FSW  -  depending  on 
the number of external devices you are modeling  it can be about that same size as 
the FSW. So now we are at 2 times the FSW SLOC count. 

"When  testing  the  FSW  in  its  entirety,  you  want  to  continue  to  simulate  the 
dynamic elements (rate gyros, accelerometers, etc.) and the ‘expendable’ elements 
(thrusters,  propulsion,  etc.)  while  using  real  hardware  for  the  static  elements 
(power management, thruster switching mechanisms, communications equipment, 
etc.) In addition, you may want tot tie the communications equipment into a ‘real’ 
base  -  for  example, with  the  4  spacecraft  you  have,  and  the  inter-spacecraft  link, 
you may want  to  test  that  link  in  the  ‘laboratory’  environment  (maybe  even with 
all 4 spacecraft!). This can take some special software for configuring the system, 
for  managing  the  elements  that  are  simulated  and  real,  and  for  providing  ‘glue’ 
between  what  can  be  real  and  what  cannot  (for  example  driving  the  thruster 
selection relays without  interfacing  to  the ‘real  thrusters’). Worst case  this will be 
another  FSW  SLOC  count.  So  now  we  are  at  3  times  the  FSW  SLOC,  which  is 
what I presented in my charts for ground support software. 

"Data collection software for each of  the networks  involved, as well as  internal  to 
the FSW if necessary, and data reduction/analysis tools will easily equal another 1 
times the FSW SLOC count. As I said in the presentation, if this software can also 
be  ‘re-used’  to  reduce/analysis  data  from  the  spacecraft  during  operations  -  that's 
even better!! Which brings us to the 4 time FSW SLOC count." 

10.5.3.2  Operations Software 

The  size  of  the  operations  software  for  the  Milstar  program  was  estimated  using 
information  from  [Keesee,  2000].  It  was  roughly  four  times  the  estimated  size  of  the 
MINERVA  flight  software. Milstar  is  a military  communications  system  that  consists  of 
four,  cross-linked  satellites  in geosynchronous orbit. These  satellites  autonomously  route 
communications  between  ground  users with  no  input  from  the Milstar  system  operators. 
While  there  are  differences  between  Milstar  and  MINERVA,  it  was  reasoned  that  the 
Milstar system is similar in complexity to the MINERVA system. 

Note  that  the  memory  and  throughput  requirements  of  the  ground  software  are  not  as 
important  as  for  the  flight  software.  This  is  because  the  size  of  the  ground  computers  is 
not  limited by  size  and mass  constraints  in  the  same way  as  the  flight  computer. For  this 
reason, only the SLOC sizes are calculated for costing purposes. The test, integration, and 
simulation software cost is included in a separate cost estimating relationship (CER) used 
for  other  components  of  the  MINERVA  system.  Therefore,  only  the  size  of  the 
operations software will be calculated for costing.

10.5.4  Software Cost Estimation 

The cost of  the  flight  and ground  software  is estimated  from  the code  size  (SLOC) using 
the  cost  estimation  numbers  from  SMAD  Chapter  20.  Table  10.54  shows  the  numbers 
used  to  estimate  the  software  cost.  Note  that  while  C  costs  more  than  Ada  (per  line  of 
code),  it  generally  requires  less  lines  of  code  than  Ada  to  complete  the  same  number  of 
instructions.

Figure 10.22: Software Cost 

We  chose  autonomy  level  2  for  the  MINERVA  system.  This  allows  the  system  to  be 
more  flexible  than  at  autonomy  level  3 while  not  adding much  cost  (relative  to  the  total 
program  cost).  The  cost  difference  between  autonomy  levels  2  and  3  is  roughly  $3 
million. A small analysis was done to see how this choice affects the operations cost after 
IOC. This is discussed in the next section. 

10.5.5  Level of Spacecraft Autonomy vs. Operations Cost after IOC 

Our present goal is to design a system that will cost under $300M by  IOC. This forces us 
to use  the cheapest possible  solution and  thus  the  least amount of autonomy. However,  it 
is  recognized  that  less  autonomy will  drive  up  the  operations  cost. To  get  a  feel  for  how 
the  spacecraft  autonomy will drive  the operations  cost of our  system,  the operations  cost 
for each autonomy level was estimated. We used the operations cost model from [Boden, 
1996]. Figure 10.23  shows  a  comparison between  the  total  software  cost  (flight  software 
plus operations software) and the estimated yearly operations costs for the different levels 
of spacecraft autonomy. Only the total software cost with C as the programming language 
is shown.

In  order  to  understand  the  cost  effects  over  the  useful  lifetime  of  our  system,  the  sum  of 
the  total  software  cost  and  the  operations  cost  was  plotted  over  the  first  five  years  after 
IOC. Inflation was not included in the cost numbers. The result is shown in Figure 10.23. 

While  less  autonomy  reduces  the  cost of  the  flight  software, more  autonomy  reduces  the 
yearly  cost  of  operations.  Initially,  the  lower  autonomy  levels  lead  to  a  lower  amount  of 
money spent. However,  the higher autonomy  level ends up being cheaper after five years 
of  operations.  This  implies  that  high  levels  of  autonomy  are  desirable  for  long  duration 
missions, but are less desirable for short duration missions.

10.5.6  Lessons Learned on Software 

It  is  often  asked:  "Why  don't  more  missions  use  more  autonomy?"  During  our  design 
process,  the  reasons  for  this  were  learned.  We  had  originally  envisioned  a  fully 
autonomous  system  that  would  allow  users  transparent  communications  and  position 
fixing capability. However, we  soon  found  that  in order  to do  this,  a  lot of money would 
be  needed  to  develop  the  flight  software.  In  order  to  meet  our  cost  cap  requirement,  we 
decided  to  use  a  low  amount  of  autonomy.  Even  though  it  would  lead  to  a  more 
expensive overall mission (including operations), we were limited in the amount of funds 
available for mission development. 

This  is  a  problem  facing  much  of  the  space  industry  today.  In  order  to  change  this,  it  is 
important  for  trade  studies  to  be  done  in  such  a  way  as  to  show  not  only  the  software 
costs  for  different  levels  of  autonomy,  but  also  how  those  autonomy  levels  will  affect 
operations  costs.  Only  in  this  way  can  the  money  controllers  be  convinced  that  paying 
more money up front for autonomy can actually reduce the overall mission cost.

Bus 

11.1 

Introduction to Bus Design38 

MINERVA consists of a constellation of four satellites in orbit around Mars. The satellite 
bus  includes  every  physical  aspect  and  component  of  the  spacecraft. The  function  of  the 
spacecraft bus  is  to  support  the  communication  and position determination payload  in  its 
orbit around Mars. 

The  bus  consists  of  several  subsystems.  The  most  important  aspect  of  the  bus  is  the 
payload  itself.  The  payload  consists  of  the  communication  and  position  determination 
systems  that  allow  the  constellation  to  perform  its  required  tasks.  In  addition  to  the 
payload, the spacecraft bus includes the following subsystems: 

Propulsion 
Power 
  Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) 
Thermal System 
Structure 
These subsystems are described in greater detail below.

The  propulsion  subsystem  is  primarily  responsible  for  maneuvering  the  spacecraft.  This 
includes getting the spacecraft into the proper orbit around the proper planet, maintaining 
that orbit, and maintaining pointing accuracy throughout the lifetime of the mission. 

It is important to accurately model the propulsion subsystem since propellant mass makes 
up  the  dominant  fraction  of  total  launch  mass.  The  propellant  mass  scales  with  the  dry 
weight  of  the  spacecraft.  For  every  kilogram  added  by  other  subsystems,  it  takes  several 
more  kilograms  of  propellant  to  accelerate  the  new  mass.  Keeping  a  close  eye  on  the 
ever-increasing  propellant  mass  is  crucial  to  meeting  launch  requirements,  as  there  is  a 
finite mass that can fit on a given launch vehicle. 

The  following  sections  detail  the  general  calculations  for  space  propulsion,  as  well  as 
design trades specific to the Project MINERVA.

11.2.1  Basics of Rocket Propulsion 

The  rocket  equation  (below),  derived  by  equating  the  momentum  of  the  vehicle  to  the 
momentum  of  the  propellant  exhaust,  relates  the  change  in mass  of  the  spacecraft  to  the 
possible change in velocity. 

 

∆ V
= e c  

M

M 0

The goal in designing a propulsion system is to determine what propulsion system is best 
(pick  the  characteristic  exhaust  velocity,  c),  and  calculate  how  much  propellant  mass  is 
required to complete the mission (∆ V). The difference between initial mass, M0, and final 
mass,  Mfinal,  is  the  propellant  mass.  The  propellant  mass  increases  as  the  final  mass 
increases.  It  is  therefore  important  to understand  the component masses  that make up  the 
final  mass,  as  they  represent  the  useful  elements  of  the  spacecraft  used  to  complete  the 
mission. Some elements of  the final spacecraft mass  that arrive at  the mission destination 
are dependent on the propellant mass as well. 
Figure 11.1 plots the ratio of final mass to initial mass as a function of ∆ V/c, where initial 
mass  is equal  to final mass plus propellant, and c is  the exhaust velocity of  the propellant 
gas.  The  curve  shows  that  as  ∆ V  increases,  c  must  also  increase  in  order  to  prevent  a 
decrease in the mass ratio.

11.2.2  Selection of Propulsion Subsystem 
For MINERVA,  the possibility of electric propulsion was considered due  to  the high  ∆ V 
required  to  perform  deep  space missions with  long  lifetimes. The  final mass  is  separated 
into power mass and the mass of everything else on board the spacecraft: 
= M * + M power  

M final

...  

Power  mass  is  important  to  consider,  as  power  is  also  a  function  of  propulsion  system 
choice  for  electric  propulsion  engines.  Rather  than  extract  chemical  energy  from  the 
reaction  of  propellant  gases,  EP  adds  energy  generated  separately  from  the  propulsion 
system  to  accelerate  the  propellant.  Therefore,  the  more  rapidly  you  want  to  accelerate 
your  exhaust  (corresponding  to  an  increase  in  c)  the  more  power  it  takes.  For 
conventional  power  production  means,  this  requires  more  mass  in  the  form  of  solar 
panels or RTG mass. As will be discussed  in  section 11.3.2,  solar panel mass  is  less  than 
RTG  mass  at  the Martian  solar  radius.  The  choice  of  c  which  minimizes  the  total  mass, 
including  propellant  and  power  mass  was  determined,  using  the  following  trade 
equations:

Figure 11.2: Power Propulsion Trade 

In this plot, the optimum point is an Isp of 2100 seconds (c = 21000), corresponding to an 
ion engine. However, mass is not necessarily the figure of merit. In order to meet the cost 
requirement  for MINERVA,  and minimize  the  cost  per  function  of  the mission,  cost  is  a 
more important driving factor. 

It turns out that power mass is more expensive than propellant mass. Power mass requires 
the  construction  of  solar  panels,  power  processing  units,  and  other  hardware.  Propellant 
mass  is  just  a  chemical  that  represents  weight  to  be  launched.  In  order  to  properly 
perform  the  trade,  the  cost  of  these  systems  must  be  considered.  For  the  propellant,  it 
must be  launched. For  the  sake of  the optimization,  a  cost of $10,000 per kg  is  assumed. 
The  power  system  must  be  built  and  launched.  A  cost  estimating  relationship  from 
SMAD is used: 
)  
Cost = 10000( M 0 + 112000 ⋅
The mass of  the power  subsystem  consists of  the mass of  solar panels  and batteries. The 
chemical  architecture  also  has  batteries  and  solar  panels,  although  they  are  smaller  than 
those needed  for  the EP  system. Figure 11.3  shows  the cost optimization. There  is now a 
clear  optimum  for  an  electric  propulsion  system.  Based  on  the  required mission  ∆ V,  the 
chemical and electric curves can move relative to one another.

Figure 11.3: Propulsion System Choice 

The  curves  on  Figure  11.3  assume  a  mission  where  each  spacecraft  exits  the  launch 
vehicle  after  it  escapes  from  the  Earth  (effectively  on  a  parabolic  orbit)  and  then 
maneuvers  itself  to Mars.  The  chemical  system will  follow  a Hohmann  transfer,  capture 
at Mars  and  aerobrake  into  orbit. The  electrical  system will  spiral  out  in  a  quasi-circular 
orbit and “fall”  into capture around Mars. The  ∆ V  for  these maneuvers was estimated by 
the orbits group. 
However,  it may  be  possible  for  the  chemical  system  to  get  enough  ∆ V  from  the  launch 
vehicle  to  ride  all  the  way  to Mars,  using  its  own  engines  for  capture  only.  The  electric 
system  cannot  benefit  from  this,  as  the  thrust  from  the  engine  is  too  low  to  capture  at 
Mars  from  a  hyperbolic  entry  orbit.  In  this  case,  the  ∆ V  for  the  chemical  system  is 
drastically reduced and the optimization changes, as seen in Figure 11.4.

Figure 11.4: Cost vs. Isp for a Chemical System that Rides the Launch to Mars 

In  the  case where  a  chemical  system  is used,  the best  Isp possible  is  around 320  seconds, 
corresponding  to MMH/NTO  liquid  bi-propellant. The  cryogenic H2-O2  engine  used  on 
the  Space  Shuttle  has  a  higher  Isp,  but  the  propellant  is  not  storable  for  the  months  of 
transfer  time.  Figure  11.5  and  Figure  11.6  show  the  relative  size  of  the  masses  for  the 
subsystems  considered  in  the  optimization  for  each  ∆ V  case.  As  Isp  increases,  the 
propellant  mass  shrinks  while  the  power  mass  grows.  For  the  case  where  the  launch 
vehicle  takes  the system  to Mars,  the chemical system  is much  less massive  than  the best 
electric system.

11.2.3  Propulsion Subsystem Design: Summary of Results 

Given  the  launch  considerations,  the  chemical  propulsion  system,  even  without 
aerobraking,  minimized  the  mission  cost.  The  following  section  describes  the  technical 
details of the chosen propulsion system. 

The  standard  for  storable  chemical  bi-propellant  engines  is  a  combination  of  mono-
methyl  hydrazine  (MMH)  for  fuel  and  nitrogen  tetra-oxide  (NTO)  for  oxidizer.  This 
propellant  offers  long-term  storability  in  liquid  form, while  gaining  higher  Isp  due  to  the 
chemical  energy  released  in  the  reaction.  NTO/MMH  had  an  Isp  of  320  s,  common  for 
space  applications.  This  technology  is  state  of  the  art  for  non-cryogenic  propulsion 
systems like the Space Shuttle Main Engines, which can operate at an Isp of 450 s.  

For  primary  propulsion,  including  capture  and  orbit  repositioning,  the  Chandra  X-Ray 
Telescope  engine  provides  the  necessary  impulse  for  a  space  vehicle  like  MINERVA. 
Manufactured by TRW,  the engine has an  Isp of 322.5 s, a mass of 4.5 kg, and a 25,000 s 
operating  life,  allowing  for  multiple  restarts  throughout  the  life  of  the  spacecraft.  The 
thrust is 4250 N, which is sufficient impulse for a 470 kg spacecraft (about 10 g’s). 

For attitude control,  including de-saturating  the momentum wheels, smaller  thrusters will 
be  used,  but  operating  with  the  same  propellant  system.  These  thrusters,  organized  in 
clusters around  the  spacecraft, can weigh as  little as 0.5 kg and operate at 11 N of  thrust. 
In  order  to  provide  total  control  of  the  spacecraft,  ten  of  these  thrusters  are  necessary. 
These small thrusters can be operated in a pulse mode to improve accuracy. 

The  propellant  system  includes  the  oxidizer  and  fuel  tanks,  the  blow-down  tank,  and  the 
valve  feed  system.  Figure  11.7  and  Figure  11.8  show  the  schematics  for  a  primary  and 
attitude  control  NTO/MMH  propulsion  system.  The  figures  are  specific  to  the  Apollo 
lunar lander, and are therefore larger than the MINERVA counterparts, but the schematic 
is similar. MINERVA of course only has one main engine, while  the Apollo  lunar  lander 
had four.

11.3  Power Subsystem Design40 

11.3.1  Purpose and Overview 

The power  subsystem  supplies  the payload  and bus with  the power necessary  to perform 
all spacecraft functions. The power subsystem performs three major functions: 
•   Power generation 
  Power storage 
  Power regulation and control 

 
There  are  various  sources  of  power  for  deep  space  missions,  including  solar  arrays  and 
radio-isotope  thermal  generators  (RTG’s).  Batteries  constitute  the  power  storage  system. 
The  batteries  store  power  for  use  during  eclipse  and  peak  power  operations  of  short 
duration.  The  power  regulation  electronics  are  responsible  for  converting  voltages, 
conditioning the power, and distributing the power within the spacecraft. 

11.3.2  Component Design 

The choice of power sources is crucial in determining the size, configuration and cost of a 
spacecraft.  Therefore,  the  first  trade  in  the  power  subsystem  dealt  with  the  selection 
between  solar  arrays  and RTG’s. The  primary  trade  between  the  two  sources  is  the  ratio 
of output power  to mass. However, many other factors contribute  to  the final selection of 
the power source. The other factors  include cost, performance, political  implications, and 
environmental  effects.  RTG’s  have  negative  political  implications  and  environmental 
risks  because  the  technology  uses  radioactive  isotopes  as  the  power  source.  From  a 
performance  perspective,  the  efficiency  of  the  solar  arrays  degrades  with  time,  thus 
limiting  the  lifetime of  the satellite. RTG’s provide a constant power output regardless of 
any environmental conditions. However, solar arrays depend on the solar flux for energy, 
which is a function of the distance from the sun. Thus, the power per mass of solar arrays 
is less at Mars than at Earth, while the power to mass of RTG’s remains constant. Error! 
Reference  source  not  found.  shows  the  radius  from  the  sun  at  which  RTG’s  become 
more  efficient  than  solar  arrays.  Since  Mars  is  at  an  average  radius  of  1.5  AU  from  the 
sun, it is advantageous to use solar arrays as the power source.

Given  the  architectural  decision  to  use  a  combination  of  solar  arrays  and  batteries  as  the 
power source, the power module focused on sizing these components. A MATLAB module 
determines the area and mass of the solar arrays and the mass of the batteries necessary to 
meet  the  power  requirements  for  all  phases  of  the  mission.  The  power  module  receives 
power  requirements  for  the  payload,  ADCS*,  thermal  subsystem*,  and  propulsion 
subsystem*.  The  (*)  subsystems  iterate  within  the  bus  module  to  converge  upon  their 
final  values.  The  power  module  uses  these  power  requirements  along  with  the  mission 
timeline  and  modes  of  operation  to  generate  the  maximum  power  requirement  during 
daylight  and  eclipse.  The  maximum  power  during  daylight  is  used  to  size  the  power 
generation  system  (solar  arrays).  The  power  requirement  during  eclipse  and  time  in 
eclipse are used to size the energy storage system (batteries). 

The required area of the solar arrays was determined by sizing for the mission phase with 
the highest power requirement. 

With  an  electric  propulsion  (EP)  system,  the  highest  power  level  would  have  occurred 
during  transfer  to  Mars  while  the  ion  thrusters  are  active.  The  power  required  to  enable 
the  EP  system  during  transit would  be  approximately  1.4  kW.  For  this  configuration  the 
satellite  would  have  to  use  large  solar  panels,  approximately  13  m2.  For  an  EP 
configuration,  the  transfer  power  would  far  exceeds  the  power  required  in  orbit  around 
Mars (approximately three times).

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

For  a  chemical  propulsion  system  the  mission  phase  requiring  the  highest  power  is  the 
Mars  orbiting  phase  (nominal  operations).  This  phase  involves  a  circular  orbit  with  a 
period  of  approximately  3.4  hours  and  an  eclipse  time  of  approximately  0.7  hours.  The 
maximum  continuous  power  required  by  the  spacecraft  during  this  phase  is  280  Watts. 
Based  on  these  parameters,  the  following  equation  is  used  to  determine  the  total  power 
that the solar arrays must collect.

After  calculating  the  required  solar  array  output,  the  MATLAB  module  determines  the 
performance of the solar cells. Since the satellite must be fully operational throughout the 
entire  design  life,  the  performance  characteristics  of  the  solar  array  must  reflect  “end  of 
life”  properties.  The  following  equation  incorporates  the  yearly  degradation  (η D)  in 
determining the power density (W/m2) of the solar arrays.

EOL = PBOl 1 − η D

The  sun  incidence  angle  used  to  determine  the  power  density  is  30 °.  This  is  the  worst 
case angle because  the solar arrays are free  to  rotate about  the north-south axis. Once  the 
module  determines  the  “end  of  life”  power  density  of  the  solar  array,  dividing  the 
required power by the power density determines the solar array area.

Finally, the area density of the solar panel is multiplied by its area to determine the mass. 
M SA = ASA ⋅ ρ SA  

 

 

The  second  sizing  function  is  to  determine  the  required  battery  mass  to  meet  the  power 
requirements during eclipse. The batteries must supply  the spacecraft with enough power 
to fully function during eclipse. Sizing batteries involves determining the battery capacity 
(W-hr)  required.  Battery  capacity  (CR)  is  a  function  of  the  power  level,  time,  depth  of 
discharge  (DOD) and  transmission efficiency. The depth of discharge  is a  function of  the 
number of charge/discharge cycles that a battery experiences during its lifetime. Depth of 
discharge decreases as the number of cycles increases.

11.3.3  Design Details 

The  configuration  of  the  spacecraft  affects  the  sizing  of  the  power  subsystem.  As 
discussed  in  section  11.3.2,  the  first  architectural  decision  within  the  power  subsystem 
was  the  choice  to  use  solar  panels  rather  than  RTG’s.  The  configuration  of  the  solar 
panels  derives  from  the  architectural  decision  to  use  a  three-axis  stabilized  spacecraft 
configuration  rather  than  spin-stabilized.  The  three-axis  stabilized  configuration  allows 
for  the  most  maneuverability  of  the  spacecraft,  which  is  vital  in  performing  the 
communication  and  position  determination  functions.  Three-axis  stabilized  satellites 
normally  use  deployable  solar  panels  because  they  can  rotate  and  position  themselves  to 
maximize  the  incident  solar  flux.  Deployable  solar  panels,  compared  to  body-mounted 
panels,  significantly  reduce  the  required  panel  area  and mass. Unfortunately,  deployable

arrays  tend  to  be  more  complex  (less  reliable)  and  more  expensive.  The  MINERVA 
satellites  use  deployable  solar  arrays  as  the  power  generation  source  because  of  mass 
savings and improved thermal management. 

The  energy  storage  system  for  the  satellite  consists  of  Lithium-Ion  batteries.  These 
batteries are preferred because they have a high specific energy  to mass relation. There is 
some  technical  risk  involved  with  using  Lithium-Ion  technology  because  they  have  not 
been  proven  for  space  flight.  The  technology  should  be  qualified  for  space  flight  before 
final  assembly  of  the  MINERVA  satellites.  Alternatively,  existing  battery  technologies 
such  as Ni-H2  could  be  used,  this would  require  increased  battery mass.  To  increase  the 
reliability of  the  energy  storage  system,  the  total battery mass  is  a  factor of 1.5  times  the 
required mass. Therefore, there is a redundant battery for every two required batteries. 

11.4  Thermal Subsystem Design41 

11.4.1  Purpose and Overview 

The motivation  for  thermal  control  of  the  spacecraft  derives  from  the  need  to  satisfy  the 
operating temperature requirements for the various satellite components. The components 
sensitive  to  the  thermal  environment  include  the  electronics,  batteries,  transponders,  and 
solar  arrays.  Table  11.2  lists  the  operating  temperature  ranges  for  these  various 
components.  The  thermal  environment  at Mars  is  colder  than  Earth  due  to  the  increased 
distance  form  the  sun.  Thermal  control  devices  heat  or  cool  the  critical  components  as 
required, thereby maintaining the temperature in the operating range.

11.4.2.1  Thermal Environment 

While  in  orbit  around  Mars  the  satellite  experiences  the  harshest  thermal  environment. 
Temperatures are highly transient, varying from 180K to 280K. The transience is due to a 
portion  of  the  orbit  being  in  eclipse,  while  the  average  low  temperature  is  due  to  the 
extreme  distance  from  the  sun  (compared  to  Earth  orbiting  satellites).  Since  the  orbital 
period  is  short  (~three  hours),  the  spacecraft  temperature  oscillates  and  does  not  have 
sufficient time to reach a steady state. 

Other  external  sources of heat  include  the  albedo  and  irradiance  from Mars. Radiation  is 
the only mode of heat transfer from the spacecraft. 

11.4.2.2  Heat Transfer 

In order  to  simplify modeling  the heat  transfer  through  the  satellite,  a  spherical model of 
constant  surface  properties  is  used  to  represent  the  body  of  the  satellite,  and  thin  planes 
for  the  solar  arrays.  For  surface  temperature  calculations,  both  the  solar  arrays  and  the 
satellite body model assume lumped thermal capacitance. The equilibrium equations used 
for determining the satellite surface and solar array temperatures are:

To determine  the  transient profile,  the  equations  are discretized  and  the  temperatures  are 
calculated at incremented time steps. 

Once  the  surface  temperature  for  a  time  increment  is  known,  the  core  temperature  is 
determined. The core temperature represents the average temperature inside the satellite.  

Modes  of  heat  transfer  within  a  satellite  include  conduction  through  the  structure  and 
radiation  between  internal  surfaces.  An  average  thermal  resistance  (Rcore)  approximates 
the  thermal  relationship  between  the  core  and  surface  temperature.  The  following 
equation captures  the  relationship between  the surface and core  temperatures. Notice  that 
this  equation  includes  the  thermal  capacitance  of  the  core,  thus  the  core  temperature  is 
transient.

11.4.2.3  Thermal Control Modeling 

The  average  core  temperature of  the  spacecraft  is determined by  integrating  the  transient 
temperature  profile  over  three  orbit  periods. By  comparing  the  average  core  temperature 
to  the  operating  temperature  ranges  of  the  thermally  critical  components,  the  thermal 
subsystem requirements can be determined. For example,  if  the average core  temperature 
is  less  than  the  nominal  operating  temperature  (as  in  our  case),  the  required  thermal 
subsystem power increases by  ∆ T/Rcore. 
Figure  11.10  illustrates  the  transient  temperature  profile  for  the  spacecraft  core, 
spacecraft surface and solar arrays.

Figure 11.10: Temperature Profile for Satellite Orbiting Mars 

 
The  required  core  temperature  is  280  K  (~  7 °C),  which  is  the  median  of  the  operating 
temperature  ranges of  the  thermally  critical  components. The  core  temperature  fluctuates 
between  270  and  286  K.  The  power  necessary  to  maintain  the  spacecraft  core  in  this 
temperature  range  is  approximately  25W.  The  solar  array  temperature  ranges  from 
approximately 190 to 265 K. This range for the solar array is low but not unreasonable. 

The total mass of the thermal control subsystem is approximated as a fraction (4%) of the 
dry mass of the satellite. This is the allotted percentage specified in SMAD. 

11.4.3  Thermal Design Details 

The  thermal  control  subsystem  consists  of  both  active  and  passive  control  devices.  The 
active  control  devices  include  heaters,  heat  pipes  and  louvers  (if  necessary). The  passive 
devices  include  paints,  radiators,  and  thermal  blankets.  Using  passive  control  devices  to 
adjust  the  absorption  and  emittance  rates helps  achieve  a desirable heat  transfer  rate  into 
and out of the satellite. Changing the ratio of absorptivity (α ) to emissivity (ε) effectively 
increases  or  decreases  the  average  spacecraft  temperature.  Since  MINERVA  is  a  deep 
space  mission,  thus  operating  in  a  colder  environment,  surface  materials  having  a  ( α
/ ε ) 
ratio near unity will be selected. 

Radiators  will  dissipate  excess  heat,  while  heaters  will  help  maintain  the  required 
temperature ranges of the batteries, tanks and electronics. 

191 

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

Unlike the Mars orbiting phase, the temperature during the transfer phase is quasi-steady. 
During  transfer  the  distance  between  the  sun  and  the  spacecraft  increases,  thus  reducing 
the  solar-flux  incident  to  the  spacecraft.  As  a  result,  the  temperature  of  the  spacecraft 
slowly  decreases  during  the  nearly  300-day  journey  to  Mars.  The  average  surface 
temperature  of  the  spacecraft  during  transfer  ranges  from  280  K  (near  Earth)  to  220  K 
(near Mars). 

11.5  Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem Design42 

The  Attitude  Determination  and  Control  Subsystem  (ADCS)  is  responsible  for  keeping 
the satellite pointed in the appropriate direction for performing a given mission objective. 

Attitude control  for each  satellite  in  the MINERVA constellation  is achieved  through  the 
use of torquers that are driven by the outputs of the on-board attitude sensors. The sensors 
and  actuators  chosen  for  each  satellite  in  this mission  are  dual  horizon  sensors,  two-axis 
digital  sun  sensors,  redundant  coarse  sun  sensors;  and  rate  gyros,  momentum/reaction 
wheels and thrusters. 

It  was  determined  that  three-axis  control  is  necessary  for  the  mission  because  of  the 
pointing  accuracy  requirement,  the  sun-oriented  solar  array  requirement,  and  the  nadir-
pointed  payload  requirement.  The  two  latter  requirements  require  at  least  two  axes  of 
control,  and  the  last  needs  a  third  axis  of  control  to  point  in  the  direction  of  flight.  Full 
active  control  (using propulsion  thrusters and wheels) was preferred over passive control 
because  of  the  pointing  accuracy  requirement  of  0.1°.  This  accuracy  is  needed  to  point 
the  Ka-band  parabolic  antenna  at  the  Earth  because  its  half-power  beamwidth  is  only 
0.3°. 

Attitude  determination  is  accomplished  by  measuring  the  orientation  of  the  satellite  in 
two  reference  vectors  fixed  in  inertial  space.  The  dual  horizon  sensors  provide 
information  in  the pitch  and  roll  axes,  and  the  two-axis  sun  sensors  in  the  yaw  and pitch 
axes. Thus,  the  horizon  sensor  establishes  the  local  vertical  reference  (two  axes)  and  the 
sun  sensor  supplies  the  third-axis  reference  (as  well  as  a  redundant  measurement).  (See 
Figure 11.11)

Figure 11.11: Attitude Determination Schematic 

The  attitude  for  each  satellite  is  determined  through  the  use  of  sun  and  horizon  sensors. 
There is allocation within the satellite for two two-axis sun sensors and four dual horizon 
sensors. These instruments output the orientation of the spacecraft with respect to the sun 
or  the  planet’s  (Mars  in  this  case)  horizon,  respectively.  Both  types  of  sensors  provide 
high  pointing  accuracy,  exceeding  the  0.1°  pointing  accuracy  requirement.  The  selected 
fine sun sensors have a field of view (FOV) of 64 x 64° and 0.02° accuracy. The selected 
horizon  sensors  have  an  accuracy  of  0.05 °   and  a  1.65  x  1.65°  FOV  (for  the  dual  sensor 
assembly). 

A  three-axis  gyro  is  to  be  used  when  the  satellite  cannot  rely  on  its  main  sensors  for 
attitude  determination.  The  gyro  measures  the  spacecraft’s  angular  rates  and,  coupled 
with  the  four  redundant  coarse  sun  sensors,  is  part  of  the  satellite’s  attitude  stabilization 
system  during  safe  mode.  The  selected  gyro  has  three  axes  outputs  and  has  a  range  of 
1000°/second. A second on-board gyro is added for redundancy.

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

There  is  space  allocated  for  the  two  accelerometers  that  the  payload  needs  to  determine 
orbit propagation. The second on-board accelerometer is added for redundancy. 

Due to weight and size constraints, small momentum/reaction wheels were chosen for the 
actuators  in  each  satellite.  There  is  space  allocated  for  three  wheels,  one  for  each  body 
principal  axis,  and  a  redundant  fourth wheel. The  set  of  three wheels  fulfils  the  pointing 
accuracy  requirement also. The selected wheels have an output  torque of 0.35 N-m and a 
momentum  output  range  of  5-10  N-m-s.  The  selected  wheels  have  an  output  torque 
greater than the maximum calculated disturbance torque of 0.15 N-m.

Torque  requirements  were  estimated  from  the  various  disturbance  torques,  namely  orbit

factor (estimated 0.6) and i is the angle of solar incidence. 

Finally, the aerodynamic torque is assessed to be: 
Ta = 0.5[ ρ ⋅ C d ⋅ A ⋅ V 2 ]

where  ρ   is  the  atmospheric  density,  Cd  is  the  drag  coefficient  (estimated  2),  A  is  the

Each estimated torque is compared and the greatest is selected to be the maximum torque 
requirement. In this case, orbit insertion was the largest torque requirement of 0.15 N-m.

11.6  Structural Design43 

The  spacecraft  structure  mechanically  supports  all  other  spacecraft  subsystems. 
Spacecraft  structure  includes  primary  structure  that  carries  the  spacecraft’s  major  loads 
and  secondary  structure  that  supports  wire  bundles,  propellant  lines,  and  other 
components.  The  bus  group  modeled  the  spacecraft  structure  to  determine  the  mass  and 
volume  of  the  spacecraft  bus.  By  summing  the  individual  mass  components  of  the 
subsystems,  the  total  spacecraft  bus  mass  was  computed.  A  pie  chart  depicting  the 
subsystems and component mass percentages is shown in Figure 11.15 and Figure 11.16.

Figure 11.16: MINERVA Subsystem Mass Breakdown 

In  order  to  determine  the  feasibility  of  the  design,  the  bus  group  calculated  a  rough 
estimate  of  the  volume  of  each  spacecraft.  SMAD  indicates  that  the  average  density  of 
spacecraft built between 1978 and 1984 was 79 kg/m2. This density was used  to compute 
a rough estimate of spacecraft volume. 

The  spacecraft  structure  serves  another  role  in  that  it  interfaces  with  the  launch  vehicle. 
To  assure  that  the  spacecraft would  fit  into  the  launch  vehicle  fairing,  Pro-Engineer was 
used to model the spacecraft in both deployed and stowed configurations. 

Various spacecraft models are shown in Appendix C.

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

11.7  Bus Cost Modeling44 

In addition to mass, power, and size, the bus group modeled the cost of the subsystems in 
an  effort  to  estimate  the  total mission  cost  from  the  ground  up.  This  activity  served  two 
main  purposes.  First,  in  order  to  compare  different  architectures  in  a  common  way,  the 
performance  of  each  was  normalized  by  its  cost.  Thus,  a  most  “cost-efficient”  design 
could be chosen. Second,  the mission had an overall budget requirement of $300 million. 
Relatively accurate modeling of spacecraft cost is an important scaling factor for the total 
mission cost. 

To  estimate  the  costs  of  the  subsystems,  Cost  Estimating  Relationships  (CERs)  from 
SMAD  Section  20.3  were  used.  CERs  are  generated  using  statistical  regression  of  data 
from  historical  space  missions.  The  relationships  used  in  the  bus  cost  model  calculate 
Research,  Development,  Testing  &  Evaluation  (RDT&E)  costs  separately  from  the 
Theoretical  First  Unit  (TFU)  costs.  Each  relationship  scales  the  cost  with  some  design 
parameter pertinent to the system. Typically, this is scaled with the subsystem dry weight, 
but may include relationships based on power or size dimension. 

The  accuracy  of  these  models  is  not  very  good  –  typically  between  25  and  50  %  of  the 
cost.  For  purposes  of  calculating  a  cost  per  function  for  architectural  comparisons,  this 
inaccuracy  is  not  very  relevant,  as  all  proposed  designs  will  benefit  or  suffer  equally. 
Choosing  the  better  of  two  options  is  still  possible.  However,  when  calculating  the  total 
spacecraft  cost  in order  to meet  the  cost  requirement,  the  inaccuracy  can put  the mission 
drastically over budget. Therefore,  in  a  separate  cost model designed  to  estimate mission 
cost,  a  25%  accuracy  margin  was  applied.  Figure  11.17  and  Figure  11.18  show  the  cost 
breakdown  for  a  single  MINERVA  spacecraft.  TFU  cost  is  used  in  a  learning  curve  in 
calculating the total hardware costs for the spacecraft.

11.8  Detailed Satellite Design45 

The  bus  module  estimates  overall  mission  cost  and  spacecraft  budgets  based  on  models 
of  subsystem  elements.  Table  11.3  shows  the  list  of  components  modeled  on  a 
MINERVA  spacecraft,  along with  the  number, mass,  and  power  of  each  subsystem.  For 
those components  that drive  the  size of  the  spacecraft, critical dimensions are  also  listed. 
For  example,  the  antenna  diameter,  propellant  tank  diameters,  and  solar  array  areas  are 
drivers of spacecraft size and are included in the design. 

The  solar  array  power  is  the  end-of-life  power  the  arrays  can  produce  at Mars. While  in 
transit  closer  to  the  sun,  the  power  density  is  higher. Throughout  the  spacecraft  lifetime, 
the performance will slowly degrade, ending at 418 Watts after 6 years. 

Reliability  is  increased  at  the  subsystem  level  through  redundancy.  There  are  extra 
batteries, sensors, and an extra reaction wheel. In safe mode, other subsystems are used to 
accomplish  similar  functions.  For  example,  the  solar  panels  can  be  used  as  sun  sensors, 
the thrusters are used for attitude control, and gyros are used in place of horizon sensors. 

The launch structure refers to the docking rings on the top and bottom of each spacecraft. 
As  seen  in  the  drawings  of  the  stowed  spacecraft  (Appendix C),  the main  antenna  hangs 
over  the  interface, so a standard belt could not be used for attachment. The docking rings 
must  remain  attached  to  the  spacecraft,  rather  than  separating,  to  avoid  damaging  the 
antenna.  Therefore,  the  mass  of  the  docking  rings  must  be  included  in  the  vehicle  mass 
that undergoes thrust maneuvers. 

The  spacecraft  maintains  contact  with  the  sun,  Mars,  and  Earth  through  Sun-Nadir 
steering. Every 180º of orbit,  the  spacecraft  flips about  the Nadir pointing axis,  reversing 
the north-south solar array directions. The solar arrays need only rotate through 180º, and 
then  rotate  back.  This  avoids  wrapping  of  any  cables,  and  allows  the  Earth  antenna  to 
always point in the proper direction.

Cost Analysis46 

13.1  Overall Philosophy 

One  of  the  specific  minimum  requirements  levied  on  the MINERVA  system  was  a  cost 
cap. The class program plan states: 

“The cost to IOC (Initial Operational Capability) is not to exceed $300 Million.” 

We  have  interpreted  this  cost  figure  to  be  in  constant  fiscal  year  (FY)  2000  dollars.  All 
cost  figures  in  the  following  analyses  are  calculated  consistent  with  this  assumption. 
Program  costs  include  launch,  spacecraft  development  and  ground  station  development. 
Operations  costs,  including  those  incurred  in  transit  to  Mars,  are  not  included.  On-orbit 
checkout activities are included. 

Treatment  of  costs  was  divided  into  three  distinct  phases,  reflecting  the  nature  of  the 
ongoing  activity.  During  the  first  phase,  preparation  for  the  Trade  Analysis  and 
Requirements  Review  (TARR),  cost  was  not  a  major  driver  because  of  the  intent  to 
define  competing  families  of  architectures  and  down-select  to  a  single  architecture. Cost 
was  assessed  at  the  TARR  to  give  a  sense  of  how  big  a  constraint  it  would  be  in  the 
preliminary design phase. As indicated below, this early assessment clearly  indicated that 
cost would be a major consideration and constraint for system design. 

The  second  phase,  preparation  for  the  Preliminary  Design  Review  (PDR),  included  cost 
analysis  as  an  integral  part  of  the  design  process.  Due  to  the  lack  of  specific  design 
details,  we  used  mass-based  Cost  Estimating  Relationships  (CERs)  to  approximate  total 
system  costs. This  approach  led  to  the  flow down of  an  allowable  spacecraft mass  to  the 
bus  and  payload  groups,  which  constrained  the  design.  Cost  constraints,  along  with 
requirements assessment, led to the selection of a four spacecraft constellation. 

In the final phase, the definition of design specifics for the Critical Design Review (CDR) 
allowed  a  more  sophisticated  approach  for  estimating  costs. We  maximized  use  of  non-
mass-based  CERs  in  order  to  let  specific  design  details  (such  as  antenna  size,  lines  of 
software code, etc.) determine our calculated costs. This approach had a more  significant 
implication  for design  trades,  since  the  cost  implications of each  trade were more  readily 
apparent. 

In  the  last  two  phases,  we  applied  two  elements  of  conservatism  to  the  cost  estimation 
process. We  retained  a  25%  cost  margin  at  PDR,  relaxing  this  margin  to  a  15%  level  at 
CDR.  The  margin  represented  risk  management  for  cost,  since  it  protected  against 
anticipated  cost  growth  associated  with  the  ongoing  design  process.  Retaining  15% 
margin  at  CDR  protects  against  cost  growth  that  has  historically  taken  place  during  the 
production, integration and test phases of a program.

We  also  applied  a  cost  factor  to  the  spacecraft  development  and  ground  system  cost 
estimates  to  account  for  limitations  in  the  CER-based  methodology.  In  the  pre-PDR 
phase,  the  cost  factor  was  based  on  comparison  to  six  deep  space  missions,  which 
provided some validation for the assumed cost levels. During the pre-CDR phase, a lower 
cost factor was used on the assumption that non-mass-based CERs would provide greater 
accuracy  than  was  possible  with  mass-based  CERs.  However,  due  to  the  complex 
selection  of  CERs  for  this  phase,  it  was  not  possible  to  do  a  validation  through 
comparison  to  other  deep  space  programs.  Cost  elements  were  generally  of  the  same 
magnitude as had been observed in the previous phase. Because of this lack of validation, 
these  cost  estimates  should  be  treated  as  approximate.  In  a  real  program,  it  would  be 
essential  to  perform  a  thorough  bottom-up  cost  estimate  for  comparison  to  the  CER 
methodology in order to ensure cost realism in the estimation process. 

13.2  TARR Cost Estimation 

The  “architecture  family”  approach  used  during  this  phase  makes  cost  estimates  highly 
speculative. We looked at a large range of possible architectures, whose costs would have 
varied  widely.  Each  architecture  was  assessed  subjectively  to  see  if  it  contained 
substantive cost drivers that might have proved problematic. 

At  the TARR,  the MINERVA  team  selected  a  single  family  of  architectures  (based  on  a 
Mars orbiting solution), allowing generation of a single point estimate to give rough order 
of magnitude  (ROM)  cost. This  estimate was  chosen  to be  in  the mid-range of  candidate 
design solutions for that family of architectures.  

The representative sample chosen for cost estimating purposes was twelve satellites (with 
90% learning curve) and 4 Delta II launches. The elements of cost for this ROM estimate, 
along  with  their  source,  are  listed  in  Table  13.1.  The  payload  line  includes  elements  for 
communication, position determination and observation (C+N+O). This ROM calculation 
was not a  true cost estimate  in  the normal  sense. Rather  this was an attempt  to  see where 
in  the  total  cost  spectrum  a  sample  architecture  might  fall.  The  sample  architecture  is 
from the Architecture 3 “family” (Mars orbiting), but it does not necessarily represent the 
number  of  satellites  or  launch  costs  that  would  actually  result  from  the  next  phase  of 
design.  

The  implications  of  this cost  estimate were  that we would need  to be  at  the  lower  end of 
cost  spectrum  for  this  type  of  architecture.  Since  total  number  of  spacecraft  in  the 
constellation  was  assumed  to  be  a  major  cost  driver,  the  estimate  implied  that  the 
eventual design would probably be in the four to six spacecraft regime rather than twelve 
spacecraft.

One  option  raised  at  the  TARR  to  accommodate  the  possible  difficulty  with  doing  the 
mission  within  the  cost  cap  was  to  consider  international  financial  partnerships.  This 
option was not pursued due  to  the  fact  that  further  system analyses  (post TARR)  showed 
a  four  spacecraft  configuration  could meet  performance  requirements without  exceeding 
the cost cap. 

The  last  resort option briefed at  the TARR was  the possibility of  relaxing  some  technical 
requirements to reduce costs. While minimum requirements were met in the next phase, it 
proved  necessary  to  delay  implementation  of  the  observation  mission  to  a  future  phase.

13.3  PDR Cost Estimation 

The PDR cost estimation was done from the top down, starting with the $300 million cost 
cap,  subtracting  launch  cost,  and  using  a  mass-based  CER  approach  to  calculate  an 
allowable  (i.e.  affordable) mass  for  the  spacecraft,  given  a  certain  number  of  spacecraft. 
The mass allowable was allocated  to  the bus group, and a sub-tier allocation of mass was 
passed  to  the  payload  group.  This  methodology  ensured  that,  as  long  as  the  total 
spacecraft  dry  mass  stayed  within  the  established  limits,  total  system  costs  would  stay 
below the cost cap. 

The  cost  methodology  used  looked  first  at  potential  launch  vehicles.  The  Delta  II  and 
Athena  II  were  chosen  because  of  their  low  cost  per  kilogram  to  orbit.  Foreign  launch 
vehicles were not considered because foreign launchers might add an undesirable element 
of  political  risk  to  the  program.  We  selected  a  12-hour  parking  orbit  (GPS  orbit)  for 
purposes of  estimating  the  necessary  launch vehicle performance. The baseline design  at 
this  point  included  electronic  propulsion  for  transfer  from  the  parking  orbit  to  Mars.  In 
the  last  design  iteration  prior  to  PDR,  the  Delta  II  was  chosen  due  to  insufficient 
performance from two Athena II launchers. 

Spacecraft  development  costs  were  calculated  based  on  the  number  of  spacecraft  in  the 
constellation, a learning curve (95%), a 25% cost margin, and a cost factor to account for 
limitations  in  the  mass-based  CER  methodology.  Note:  the  CER  methodology  used  is 
described  in  more  detail  in  the  cost  modeling  portion  of  the  bus  description  (section 
12.7). 

To validate the cost levels calculated by the CER methodology, outputs of the cost model 
were compared to data from six deep space missions. These missions were: Mars Climate 
Observer, Mars Polar Lander, Stardust, Deep Space 1, NEAR and Lunar Prospector. This 
comparison  showed  the  CER  model  was  under-stating  the  probable  costs,  which 
indicated  the  need  for  a  cost  factor  to  scale  costs  to  a  more  realistic  level.  Table  13.2 
presents cost and mass information on the six deep space missions.

one  of  the  missions  that  was  above  average  cost/kg.  Stardust  (.427)  was  a  mission  of 
similar  size  and  equal  or  greater  complexity.  Taking  the  ratio  of  the  Stardust  cost/kg  to 
the value from the model (for a 400 kg spacecraft mass) yielded a cost factor of 1.78. 

Given  the  need  for  design  iterations,  the  output  of  the  cost  model  was  expressed  as 
spacecraft dry mass  allowable  for  a  range of possible numbers of  spacecraft. This output 
is reflected in Figure 13.1.

13.4  CDR Cost Estimation 

Due to the increasing availability of design detail during this phase, it was possible to use 
design-based CERs  to drive  the cost estimate. The payload group and  the bus group each 
used CERs from SMAD section 12.7. 

Design  trades and assessments  in  this phase  took place  in a concurrent engineering mode 
in  the  design  lab.  The  payload  group  module  provided  payload  costs  as  an  input  to  the 
bus  group  module,  which  added  bus  costs  and  provided  two  cost  figures  to  the  systems 
MATLAB  module.  These  figures  were  the  research,  development,  test  and  evaluation 
(RDT&E) costs and the theoretical first unit (TFU) costs associated with the design under 
evaluation.  The  launch  module  evaluated  the  spacecraft mass  associated with  the  design 
and  provided  the  systems  module  with  a  launch  cost.  Total  ground  software  cost  was 
constant  in  the  systems  module,  based  on  information  from  the  payloads  group  (see 
section 11.2.4.) The concurrent engineering cost scheme is presented in Figure 13.2. 

The  systems module  used  these  inputs  to  generate  total  systems  costs, which were made 
up  of  launch,  spacecraft  development  and  ground  station  development  costs. Within  the 
systems module,  spacecraft development costs  included a 10% profit, a 15% cost margin 
and a 1.25 cost factor  to  reflect potential  inaccuracy  in  the CER methodology. Even with 
the  cost  factor,  it  should  be  noted  that  cost  estimates  using  this  methodology  cannot  be 
considered  as  reliable  as  bottom-up  cost  estimates.  In  a  typical  program,  such  a  bottom-
up  cost  estimate  would  be  developed  concurrently  with  detailed  design,  providing  a 
sanity check for CER-based estimates.

Ground station development also  included a 10% profit and a 15% cost margin, although 
no  cost  factor was  applied. Ground  station  costs were modeled  as  1.5  times  the  value  of 
ground  software  (see  section  10.5  for  a  software  cost  description.)  This  factor 
encompassed  anticipated  costs  for  equipment, management,  etc. We  assumed  JPL would 
provide  space  and  equipment  to  minimize  costs  because  of  their  dependence  on  the 
MINERVA system to support JPL Mars missions. 

The  launch  vehicle  selected  in  this  phase  of  design  was  the  Delta  III.  We  assumed  a 
reduction  in Delta  III  costs would  come  about  because  of EELV-related  efficiencies  and 
market  pressures,  resulting  in  a  launch  cost  of  $56.25  million  (25%  reduction  from 
today’s $75 million cost.) 

Finally,  the  cost  estimation  specifically  excludes  all  operations  costs,  both  for  transit  to 
Mars  and  for  on-orbit  operations  at Mars. The  class  elected  to perform  an  official design 
freeze  approximately  two  weeks  before  CDR.  Table  13.3  presents  the  four  options 
considered  for  the  down-select,  which  looked  at  three  versus  four  spacecraft  and 
electrical versus chemical propulsion. Option 2 was selected because it came in under the 
cost  cap  (at  a  CDR  margin  level)  and  met  all  requirements.  Options  3  and  4,  with  three 
spacecraft, did not meet all technical requirements.

By  the  time  of  final  preparations  for  CDR,  some  minimal  design  changes  and 
modifications  to  cost  estimations  resulted  in  slightly  different  final  cost  figures.  Margin 
was  available  to  add  a  payload  capability  for  on-orbit  position  determination  fix,  which 
improved timeliness of the position determination capability. 

Figure  13.3  shows  the  major  elements  of  cost  that  contributed  to  the  final  MINERVA

13.5  Conclusions 

The total program cost estimated at CDR ($297.9 M) contained a 15% cost margin below 
the $300M cost cap  for  spacecraft and ground  station development. This margin protects 
the program from potential cost growth during the production, integration and test phases 
of  the  program.  However,  due  to  the  lack  of  available  means  to  validate  the  1.25  cost 
factor  (which was  used  to  account  for  inaccuracies  in  the CER methodology),  these  cost 
figures  cannot  be  regarded  with  high  confidence.  Cost  risk  for  the  program  would  be 
greatest  in  the  areas  of  flight  and  ground  software,  integration  and  test,  and  launch  (if 
EELV-related cost savings are less than 25%).

System Reliability 

The MINERVA  system  reliability  analysis was  accomplished mainly  through  the  use  of 
three tools: failure tree analysis, safe modes analysis, and event reliability analysis. Much 
of  this  analysis  was  accomplished  and  carried  through  implicitly  throughout  the  design, 
often  with  different  reliability  concepts  used  within  different  subgroups.  A  more 
established  and  explicit manner  of  executing  the  reliability  analysis  earlier  in  the  design 
would have aided in the optimization and clarification of functions and components. 

14.1  Failure Tree Analysis47 

This  analysis  included  an  examination  of  the  critical  failures  that  could  occur within  the 
MINERVA  system,  rather  than  the  common  fault  tree  analysis  method  that  examines 
more closely the individual faults and how they propagate. It is recognized, however, that 
each  of  the  critical  failures  in  MINERVA  would  likely  result  from  a  lower  level  fault. 
Taking  this  into  account,  much  of  the  reliability  and  redundancy  analysis  held  to  the 
philosophy  that  utilized  multi-path  subsystems  as  much  as  possible,  rather  than 
completely  redundant  components.  Some  completely  redundant  components  were 
necessary, however,  to  prevent  subsystems  from  the possibility  for  a  single-point  failure. 
For  the  sake  of  clarifying  and  simplifying  the  problem,  this  analysis  attends  to  the  setup 
portion of the MINERVA lifetime separately from the nominal lifetime operations. 

The setup portion of the system includes launch, separation, detachment of the individual 
spacecraft,  transfer  from  the  parking  orbit  to  the  Mars  sphere  of  influence,  capture  into 
the  Martian  orbits,  and  deployment  of  necessary  spacecraft  mechanisms.  Launch, 
separation,  and  transfer  exhibit  binary  reliability;  either  they  successfully  occur  or  they 
fail, due  to  the united nature of  the  spacecraft during  these phases. Detachment, Capture, 
and Deployment may  involve partial  success,  to where only  some of  the  spacecraft meet 
success  in  these  phases.  Figure  14.1  diagrams  the  MINERVA  Setup  failure  tree  with 
critical subsystem or activities listed under the “success” of each phase.

The  failure  tree  analysis  for  the  nominal  lifetime  operations  segment  includes  the 
possibility  of  no  failures,  externally-caused  failures,  and  internally-caused  failures. 
External  sources  of  failure  account  for  interactions  with  external  interfaces,  as  well  as 
environmental  factors.  Internal  sources of  failure  include  system operators,  software, and 
hardware. Due  to  the  highly  coupled  nature  of  subsystems within  each  of  the  spacecraft, 
the  analysis  examined  critical  failures within  components  rather  than  subsystems.  Figure

14.2  Safe Modes48 

Each MINERVA satellite  is capable of entering  three  levels of Safe Mode, which exhibit 
progressive  levels  of  operations  reduction  or  shutdown.  The  advantages  of  this  anomaly 
resolution  scheme  lie  with  a  graceful  implementation  of  recovery  methods,  and  by  the 
same notion, graceful degradation of system functions. This method also maintains a high 
level of  availability  to  the users  rather  than  a  scheme by which  the  satellite goes directly 
to  system  shutdown  each  time  an  anomaly  occurs.  This  method  uses  autonomy  to 
compensate  for  the high  time  latency  in communication compared  to  that experienced by 
Earth-orbiting  satellites.  As  the  MINERVA  system  will  see  about  a  twenty-minute  time 
lag  between  origination  and  receipt  of  a  satellite  status  transmission,  the  satellite  must 
have  the  ability  to  take autonomous action  to prevent  spacecraft  loss within  those  twenty 
minutes.  The  disadvantage  of  this  level  of  autonomy  results  from  additional  complexity 
within the system as well as increased cost and time in the development and testing of the 
Safe Mode software. 

14.2.1  Safe Mode 1 

Should  a  satellite’s  regular  subsystem  checkout  identify  a  problem,  or  a  subsystem  send 
an  anomaly  flag,  the  spacecraft  will  enter  Safe  Mode  1.  This  mode  is  the  first  level  of 
anomaly/fault  resolution.  All  anomaly/fault  resolution  efforts  begin  in  this  stage  to 
determine the nature and severity of the anomaly. 

Anomalies  include  irregularities  in  system  functions,  such  as  incorrect  power  levels  or 
unexpected  signals.  Faults  include  non-performance  of  system  functions,  such  as  loss  of 
power or absence of required signals. 

In  the  specific  occurrence  that  the  main  processor  resets,  an  identical  backup  processor 
runs  operations  while  the  main  computer  reinitializes.  The  backup  processor  maintains 
and  then  reloads  the  primary  processor  with  all  recent  satellite  navigation  and  user 
positioning information, which is in non-volatile storage for this reason. 

If at all possible, the satellite “flies through” problems in this mode, and uses autonomous 
resolution  schemes  to either correct or  reroute around  the anomaly or  fault. Satellites use 
self-checking and cross-checking with other MINERVA satellites in order to pinpoint the 
source  and  effects of  the  anomaly. For  example,  antenna  anomalies  first  receive  scrutiny 
through  self-diagnostic  procedures,  and  then  through  cross-link  testing  with  other 
MINERVA satellites. 

In  this  mode,  the  satellite  holds  primary  analysis  responsibility,  and  will  only  notify  the 
Earth  Ground  Station  (EGS)  of  Safe  Mode  1  activity  within  the  regular  transmission 
cycles. Should  the severity of  the anomaly exceed Mode 1 definitions and abilities of  the 
satellites to correct the problem, the satellite enters either Safe Mode 2 or 3, and transmits 
a notification and status signal to the EGS for assistance.

MIT Space Systems Engineering - MINERVA Design Report 

14.2.2  Safe Mode 2 

This mode includes non-critical power or mechanical failures. The satellite cannot fix the 
problem  autonomously  but  complete  operational  shutdown  is  not  necessary.  This  mode 
will  attempt  to  maintain  the  highest  level  of  availability  possible  with  degraded  system 
health.  The  intermediate  level  of  operations  reduction  may  include  the  decision  by  the 
EGS to shut down individual satellite components or subsystems. 

14.2.3  Safe Mode 3 

This mode  involves  the  highest  level  of  system  shutdown,  to where  availability  is  not  of 
concern, but rather saving the spacecraft for future utility. This mode is entered as a result 
of  a  spacecraft  critical  control  failure  such  as  a  loss  of  control  software,  ADCS  sensors, 
actuators, and thrusters. It is essential that each satellite maintain the ability to account for 
these  critical  failures  and  their  propagation,  since  there  may  be  up  to  fourteen  hours 
between the time of failure and contact with the EGS. 

Safe  Mode  3  software  accounts  for  the  criticality  of  circumstances  and  length  of 
communication  latency  by  autonomously  shutting  down  all  non-essential  subsystems, 
turning  nadir  to  Mars,  and  pointing  the  solar  arrays  normal  to  the  sun  until  instructions 
are received from the EGS. 

14.3  Event Reliability Analysis49 

Like  the  failure  tree  analysis,  this  analysis  was  broken  down  into  set-up  and  nominal 
operations  segments.  Much  of  the  set-up  design  was  driven  by  cost  rather  than  by 
reliability  due  to  the  limited  number  of  options  available  within  the MINERVA  budget. 
For  this  reason,  a  single  point  failure  exists  at  the  launch  phase,  with  a  single  booster 
rather  than  distributed  launches.  Table  14.1  details  the  reliabilities  used  in  this  analysis 
for each phase.

The  MINERVA  system  reliability  plot  Figure  14.3  combines  the  Setup  and  Lifetime 
Operations  segments  and  depicts  the  distribution  of  reliability  throughout  the  mission 
phases. The plot  shows  six years,  to  include almost a year  for  system  setup plus  the  five-
year operational  lifetime  requirement. At  the end of  the six years,  the MINERVA system 
exhibits  approximately  79%  probability  of  success  with  four  operational  spacecraft,  and 
83% with three spacecraft. This point is a major factor of reliability and risk reduction for 
the  MINERVA  system.  The  minimum  requirements  can  be  met  with  only  three 
spacecraft,  but  four  give  increased  performance  and  reduced  risk.  In  effect,  the  whole 
system can account for four-for-three redundancy in terms of functioning spacecraft.

Conclusions 

15.1  MINERVA Architecture 

MINERVA  represents  a  feasible  architecture  for  a  communication  and  position 
determination  infrastructure  around Mars.  The  detailed  design  meets  all  of  the  technical 
requirements  specified  in  Appendix  A.  Our  cost  estimate  of  $297.9  M  satisfies  the  cost 
cap requirement, although limitations inherent in the Cost Estimating Relationship (CER) 
methodology  would  make  a  bottom  up  cost  estimate  highly  desirable  to  ensure  realistic 
cost  figures.  Performance  of  the  MINERVA  system  significantly  exceeds  requirements 
for maximum revisit time, and provides partial coverage up to 65 degrees north and south 
of  the equator. Selection of a  four-spacecraft architecture  leads  to  robustness  in  the event 
that  one  spacecraft  fails,  since  both  the  communication  and  positioning  missions  can 
continue at a slightly reduced level of performance. 

The  class  consensus  was  that  a  Mars-orbiting  infrastructure  system  like  MINERVA 
would  be  a  significant  advantage  for  future  Mars  robotic  exploration  missions,  and  it  is 
our  hope  that  NASA  planning  that  is  already  underway  will  lead  to  development  and 
deployment of such a system. 

15.2  Lessons Learned 

The  biggest  challenge  faced  by  the  class  was  maintaining  communication  between  the 
different  groups.  The  class  learned  several  methods  for  improving  communication  and 
minimizing  errors.  In  particular,  frequent  integration meetings of  the  systems group with 
representatives  from  each  of  the  other  groups  helped  uncover  disconnects  and  mistakes 
earlier  than  would  otherwise  have  been  possible.  Also,  communication  was  expedited 
during  concurrent  engineering  sessions due  to  the  real-time  interactions of  the group  and 
the  ability  to  share  input  and  output  parameters  with  ICEMAKER  software.    All  of  the 
groups  reported  finding  mistakes  in  their  module  codes  as  a  result  of  evaluating  the 
results  of  concurrent  engineering  runs.  These  sessions  therefore  led  directly  to  rapid 
improvement  in  sophistication  and  accuracy  of  modeling  the  various  systems  in 
MATLAB code. 

Over  the  course  of  the  semester,  the  class  experienced  two  significant  transition  points. 
Our efforts to retain design flexibility allowed innovative thinking, but the team reached a 
point  after  the  TARR  when  a  significant  reduction  of  the  trade  space  was  essential  in 
order  to  meet  design  review  milestones.  Completion  of  the  TARR  led  to  the 
reorganization  of  the  class  into  different  teams  developing  the  various  aspects  of  the 
design. Once  the class was able  to make  this  transition,  the groups were able  to complete 
their  preliminary  design  activities.  Based  on  this  experience,  the  systems  group 
encouraged  a  rapid  transition  to  detailed  design  activities  and  concurrent  engineering 
sessions  after  completion  of  the  PDR.  The  class  was  successful  in  maintaining 
momentum  during  this  second  transition,  which  led  to  a  detailed  design  campaign  that 
culminated in CDR and generation of this design document.

The  class  found  concurrent  engineering  to  be  a  useful  practice  for  rapid  characterization 
of  a  multitude  of  design  options.  Each  group  continued  their  detailed  design  analysis 
work  in  between  sessions  to  clarify  which  options  should  be  evaluated  in  concurrent 
engineering.  ICEMAKER  was  a  useful  tool  for  exchanging  input  and  output  values 
through its subscribe and publish capabilities. 

Most  of  all,  the  class  learned  about  the  challenges  of  doing  systems  engineering  for  a 
major  design  project  in  a  large  group  setting.  Tools,  theory,  and  methodology  were 
important, but so was  the dynamic of human  interaction.    In  the end, we have discovered 
that people determine the level of project success. 

 

15.3  Recommendations and Future Work 

Some  interesting  studies were  left  undone  due  to  the  time  span  of  the  class.   A  first  area 
of  additional  work  would  address  further  details  within  the  existing  design.    The  details 
of  heat  exchangers,  plumbing,  and  electrical  wiring  in  the  bus  design,  and  the  payload 
multiple  access  scheme  and  protocols  in  the  payload  design  are  some  areas  of  potential 
improvement.  With  further  design  details,  a  bottom  up  cost  estimate  would  be  made 
possible. Such an estimate is very time-consuming to perform, but it is the only means of 
establishing a highly reliable cost estimate. 

Evaluating  the performance of  the current design for accomplishing secondary objectives 
would also be an interesting study. A good example is MINERVA’s potential capabilities 
for  communication  with  and  orbit  determination  of,  spacecraft  orbiting  or  approaching 
Mars. 

A  second  area  of  work  would  address  the  expandability  of  the  system’s  performance. 
Future work might  study  the best way  to  improve  the performance of  the  system  if more 
money  was  available.  Planning  for  a  human  presence  on  Mars  would  require  additional 
research. Possible  areas  of mission  expansion  include  additional  satellites  for  continuous 
coverage, reduced time to accuracy and improved reliability, improved autonomy through 
the  uploading  of  replacement  software,  and  in-situ  orbit  determination  measurement 
coupled  with  highly  autonomous  software  for  on-board  orbit  propagation  and  MSE 
position determination.   Future spacecraft could also perform additional missions such as 
remote sensing and continuous Mars weather forecasting. 

MINERVA  represents  a  plausible  architecture,  designed  to  meet  the  cost  and 
performance  requirements  placed  on  the  16.89  class. The MARSNET,  proposed  by  JPL, 
represents  another  possible  architecture,  meeting  a  different  set  of  user  requirements. 
With  less  stringent  cost  or  data  return  constraints,  an  interesting  area  of  future  work 
would  be  to  compare  a  wide  range  of  such  architectures  on  the  basis  of  a  cost  per 
function.    Feasible  point  designs  such  as  MINERVA  serve  as  a  strong  basis  for  this 
research.

Due  to  the  time  constraints  of  the  semester,  some  design  details  could  not  be 
accommodated.  Future  work  could  address  design  of  radiators,  plumbing  and  electrical 
wiring, and other details of the bus and payload configurations. 

Another  beneficial  future  activity  would  be  a  bottom  up  cost  estimate,  which  would  be 
possible after completion of  the design details described above.   Such an estimate  is very 
time-consuming  to perform, but  it  is  the only means of establishing a highly  reliable cost 
estimate. 

While  the  communications  and  positioning missions  are  described  in  the  current  design, 
another  future  task  could  include  a  more  detailed  description  of  how  these  missions  are 
performed by the software, both on the ground on onboard the multiple spacecraft. 

Several  options  for  expansion  of  the  network  could  also  be  designed.  These  options 
include  improved  autonomy  through  upload  of  replacement  software,  positioning  and 
communications  services  for  other  spacecraft,  relay  between  MSEs  without  Earth 
interaction, automated ground operations, and additional spacecraft in the constellation to 
improve  coverage,  availability  and  reliability.  Future  spacecraft  could  also  provide more 
advanced capabilities such as remote sensing if the funds were available for development 
and integration of the required hardware and software. 

Improvement  in  the  approach  to  concurrent  engineering  would  be  possible  through 
integration  of  MATLAB  modules  or  re-coding  in  EXCEL  to  interface  directly  with 
ICEMAKER.
