Abstract 

 

On January 14, 2004, President George W. Bush presented  the nation with a bold new 
initiative 
to  “explore  space  and  extend  a  human  presence  across  our  solar 
system…using  existing  programs  and  personnel…one  mission,  one  voyage,  one 
landing  at  a  time.”  (Bush,  2004)  NASA  was  charged  with  the  task  of  developing  a 
sustainable and affordable human space exploration program with the initial objective of 
returning  a  human  presence  to  the  Moon  by  the  year  2020.  The  directive  thus  raises 
two  broad  engineering  questions:  First,  what  is  the  purpose  of  an  exploration  system, 
and how one evaluates  its performance. Second, how does one architect a  sustainable 
space  exploration  system?  The  following  report  makes  the  case  that  the  primary 
purpose  of  an  exploration  system  is  the  delivery  of  knowledge  to  the  stakeholders,  and 
that the design should be evaluated with respect to knowledge.

1.  Introduction 

 

On January 14, 2004 President George W. Bush presented the nation with a new vision 
for  space.  The  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA)  will  develop  a 
sustainable  human  space  exploration  program  taking  humans  back  to  the  Moon  by 
2020,  and  eventually  to Mars  and  beyond  (Bush,  2004). The  vision,  and  plan  that  goes 
with  it,  calls  for  the  completion  of  the  ISS,  the  retirement  of  the Space Shuttle  by  2010, 
and  the  development  of  a  new Crew Exploration Vehicle  (CEV). Bush’s  vision  provides 
a  bold  push  towards  mankind’s  traversing  of  the  solar  system.  The  following  report, 
representing  the  culmination  of  MIT’s  2004  spring  16.89  graduate  design  class, 
presents a design methodology and conceptual tools to facilitate the achievement of this 
vision.  It  addresses  two  critical  questions  facing  the  space  community:  What  is 
sustainability  in  the  context  of  space  systems?  How  can  sustainability  be  provided  for 
during conceptual design? The  following  report addresses  these questions.  In doing so, 
it demonstrates that an exploration program is by definition a knowledge acquisition and 
transfer system, and it presents a process by which one may design for sustainability. 
 
The goal of exploration is knowledge 
 
While  the  motivation  behind  exploration  has  varied  throughout  history,  the  primary 
function  of  any  “exploration  system”  has  been  to  discover  the  unknown,  to  gain 
knowledge. Some of  the more common ways  to gain knowledge have been  through  the 
use of visual, electrical, or physical  transportation of  information. A simple example of a 
space knowledge transfer system is the human eye. The human eye gathers knowledge 
in  the  form  of  light.  Several  hundred  years  ago  mankind  developed  the  telescope  in  a 
hope  to  improve  upon  the  amount  of  knowledge  delivered  to  the  eye  through  the 
discovery  of  magnification.  The  magnification  of  objects  resulted  in  a  higher  order  of 
knowledge resolution and consequently more information about space was discovered. 
 
More  recently  mankind  has  sent  satellites  and  drones  into  the  solar  system,  with 
sensors  that  can  gather  information  unattainable  by  the  human  eye  alone.  Information 
gathered  by  these  systems  is  sent  back  to  Earth  through  the  use  of  electrical 
transmissions where it is turn into knowledge. A number of characteristics increases the 
“knowledge  resolution”  of  these  satellites  and  drones  compared  to  telescopes, 
including:  Shorter  distance  between  optics  and  target,  physical  contact,  sample  return, 
in-situ  analysis,  etc.    It  is  noteworthy  that  order  to  achieve  this  higher  of  knowledge 
resolution,  mankind  had  move  beyond  light  as  the  sole  transfer-mechanism,  to  in-situ 
measurement  and  mass  transport.  Future  exploration  systems  must  necessarily  follow 
this  trend, exploiting  the duality between mass and knowledge  transfer, with one critical 
improvement--humans  will  provide  degree  of  knowledge 
resolution  previously 
unimaginable with satellites, drones, and telescopes alone. 
 
No  matter  the  form  of  the  space  exploration  system  (human  eye,  telescope,  robotic 
probe,  or  human  contact),  the  end  product  of  the  exploration  system  is  knowledge. 
Currently,  the majority of  the work being completed on NASA’s new  initiative  is directed 
towards  a  new  exploration  vehicle.  The  class  believes  that  any  new  space  vehicle 
developed by NASA must be designed with an understanding  that  it will be but one  tool

in  system whose  ultimate  function  is  to  gather  and  transfer  knowledge  in  space  and  on 
Earth.  
 
 
To  say  that  an  exploration  system  must  deliver  knowledge  to  achieve  its  goal  is  to 
recognize  that  while  mass  transport  enables  exploration,  the  ultimate  success  of  an 
expedition depends on the acquisition, communication, and synthesis of visual  imagery, 
scientific  data,  and  human  experience  to  key  stakeholders.  This  suggests  revaluing 
traditional  space  system  characteristics  and  trades  to  account  for  the  demands  of 
knowledge  acquisition  and  delivery.  Further,  in  order  to  make  clear  decisions  about 
system capabilities and mission goals, attributes of knowledge must be categorized and 
valued in accordance with stakeholder needs. System designers must have a firm grasp 
of  the  knowledge  delivery  process,  and  establish  how  it  will  occur  at  each  point  in  the 
system’s lifecycle. 
 
 
 
Sustainability in the Design Process 
 
Before knowledge can be incorporated into system valuation and trades, however, there 
must be a clear understanding of what  is a  sustainable space system and how can  this 
can be addressed during conceptual design? Current space system design methods are 
not  geared  towards  enhancing  “sustainability.”  Traditionally,  they  have  focused  on 
developing  requirements,  conducting  trades  based  on  assumptions  about  the  future, 
and  then  optimizing  the  system  with  regard  to  some  metric.  Results  are  commonly 
single point designs optimized for single missions.  
 
While  such  methods  have  proven  adequate  for  low-frequency  missions,  they  rely  on 
assumptions about an uncertain future. A design that is optimal at one point in time may 
become  less  optimal  in  the  future. Due  to  the  expected  duration  of  the  new  exploration 
initiative,  major  investments  should  note  be  made  based  on  unverified  assumptions. 
The  new  exploration  system  should  be  designed  so  that  it  can  respond  to  changes  in 
the  future.  The  approach  to  design  described  in  this  report  addresses  this  problem. 
Using  an  iterative  process,  and  emerging  system  valuation  tools,  it  creates  a  rigorous 
development strategy which is flexible and robust to environmental changes. 
 
Chapter two proposes a definition of sustainability. Drawing from recent scholarship and 
historical  examples,  it  argues  that  sustainable  exploration  programs  must  first  and 
foremost  have  the  capability  to  manage  various  kinds  of  uncertainty,  including  policy, 
budgetary,  technical,  and  logistical  changes.  Conceptual  designs  must  provide  system 
operators  with  the  ability  to  anticipate  and  capitalize  on  emerging  opportunities  and 
positive  feedback  loops while simultaneously adapting  to changing value-structures and 
external circumstances.  
 
Properties 
flexibility,  extensibility, 
termed 
that  enable  sustainability  have  been 
robustness,  and  commonality.  Much  recent  scholarship  has  addressed  the  need  to

      13              

 

rigorously  value  these  system  properties  for  the  purposes  of  design.  Generally,  these 
properties translate to formal architectural attributes, such as modularity and platforming, 
as  well  as  operational  attributes  such  as  staged  deployment  and  spiral  development. 
Chapter  three  defines  these  terms  in  the  context  of  space  systems,  and  presents 
methods for their formalization in system architecture. 
 
There  are  two  ways  in  which  flexibility  and  extensibility  are  introduced  and  evaluated: 
mathematical  evaluation  methods  and  architecture  design  considerations.  The 
mathematical  evaluation  methods  used  are  based  upon  decision  analysis,  real  options 
theory, and scenario planning. The architectural design considerations are commonality, 
scalable systems, and modularity. Both methods evaluate a given system based on  the 
resulting  value  of  knowledge  delivered  by  the  system.  Notice  that  the  system  is  not 
evaluated  on  cost  or  mass,  but  on  knowledge,  which  is  the  primary  purpose  of  an 
exploration system. 
 
A major  aspect  of  this  study  involves  identifying  a  process  to  combine  these  properties 
and methods can be systematically incorporated into system design. Part of the solution 
involves  creating  a  strategy,  rather  than  a  point  design,  that  can  react  to  change. 
Chapter 4 presents an example strategy, or “baseline,” which was conceived through an 
iterative  process  of  design,  needs  mapping,  and  synthesis  of  sub-strategies.  Sub-
strategies  consist  of  small,  medium,  and  large  Moon  and  Mars  expeditions,  each 
designed  with  principles  of  extensibility  such  as  commonality  and  staged  deployment. 
Individually,  these  missions  are  rough  “point-designs.”  However,  major  architectural 
decisions in each reflect anticipation of gradually increasing mission scale, and eventual 
transit to Mars. 
 
After  completing  the  sub-strategies,  areas  of  functional  commonality  and  uniqueness 
can be anticipated across the system, and architectural forms refined appropriately. The 
resulting  forms  and  operations  can  then  be  synthesized  into  an  integrated  life-cycle 
strategy, with  options  for  reacting  to  uncertainty. The  following  schematic  illustrates  the 
design process used:

      14              

 
In developing  the  integrated baseline, commonality  trades at  the  formal and operational 
level become necessary. Chapter 5 details such trade studies and their results. 
 
Once  the  final  version  of  the  baseline  strategy  and  associated  trades  has  been 
developed,  more  rigorous  tools  may  be  applied  to  determine  when,  and  under  which 
circumstances  different  design  options  become  valuable.  For  example,  the  decision  to 
transit  through  the  Earth-Moon  Lagrangian  Libration  Point  1  (EM-L1)  while  en  route  to 
the  Moon  may  not  be  optimal  for  a  single  mission  to  the  lunar  equatorial  region. 
However, if the frequency of non-equatorial lunar missions is sufficiently high, the option 
of utilizing EM-L1 becomes increasingly valuable. Tools, including modified forms of real 
options  valuation,  can  inform  trade  studies  of  this  sort,  resulting  in  up-front  design 
decisions that drastically reduce life-cycle cost and increase system flexibility.  
 
Chapter  6  introduces  such  tools  and  methods.  Scenario  planning  is  applied  to  the 
integrated  strategy  to  examine  how  the  system  can  react  to  environmental  changes. 
Adjustments  are  then  suggested,  based  upon  the  baseline’s  reaction  to  the  scenarios. 
Decision  analysis  and  Real  Options  analysis  techniques  are  also  used  to  determine  at 
what  point  time-critical  decisions  should  be  made  in  the  execution  of  the  baseline 
strategy, and which investments should be made now to allow for the option of adapting 
to future uncertainty.

2.  Intro to Sustainability 

 

What  exactly  is  a  sustainable  exploration  program?  In  one  sense,  the  answer  is  rather 
straightforward.  To  “sustain”  means  literally:  to  maintain  in  existence,  to  provide  for,  to 
support  from  below  (Dictionary.com website). At  the  programmatic  level,  an  exploration 
system  will  be  maintained  in  existence  so  long  as  it  is  funded,  and  it  will  be  funded 
provided  it  meets  the  needs  of  key  stakeholders,  members  of  Congress,  the 
Administration,  and  ultimately  the  American  people.  Realistically,  however,  system 
designers must  recognize  that  these needs  themselves will change. A multi-year, multi-
billion  dollar  program  in  the  US  Government  must  expect  to  face  a  great  deal  of 
uncertainty with respect to objectives, budget allocations, and technical performance. 
 
In  order  for  an  exploration  system  to  be  sustainable,  then,  it must  be  able  to  operate  in 
an  environment  of  considerable  uncertainty  throughout  its  life-cycle.  Designing  for 
sustainability  implies  identifying  sources  of  uncertainty  and managing  them  through  up-
front  system  attributes.  Various  terms  have  been  used  to  describe  such  system 
attributes, including: flexibility, robustness, and extensibility.  
 
While  a  large  complex  system  must  react  to  changing  environments  in  order  to  be 
sustainable,  technological  aspects  of  systems  can  themselves  impact  the  environment. 
Once  in  development  and  operation,  a  multi-billion-dollar  system  will  mediate  political 
interests, organizational decisions, and technical alternatives, creating potential sources 
of  stability  and  positive  feedback-loops,  as  well  as  sources  of  uncertainty.  Early 
decisions  that  create  high  switching  costs  or  large  infrastructure  sites,  can  “lock-in” 
architectural  configurations  and  influence  the  objectives  and  development  path  of  later 
systems  (Klein,  2000). A  sustainable  design will  be  one  in which,  to  the  greatest  extent 
possible,  the  dynamics  behind  political,  technical,  and  financial  sources  of  stability 
support, rather than hinder, system development and operations.  
 
The  following  chapter  identifies  three  kinds of  sustainability, and  relates  these  to  formal 
system  attributes.  It  reviews  current  thinking  about  flexibility  and  extensibility,  and  their 
relation  to  architectural  form.  The  chapter  concludes  with  a  historical  investigation  of 
Antarctic exploration, drawing lessons for the sustainability of exploration programs. 

2.1 Elements of Sustainability 
It  is  increasingly  evident  that  large,  complex,  technological  systems  cannot  be 
conceived independently from the political, economic, and organizational environment in 
which  they  operate. While  at  a  technical  level,  exploration  is  dependant  on  continuous 
and  reliable  logistical  support,  at  a  programmatic  level,  political  and  organizational 
factors  greatly  affect  sustainability.  With  space  activities  in  particular,  motivations  and 
objectives  can  change  rapidly  compared  to  system  life-cycles,  increasing  the  impact  of 
political  and  organizational  issues  on  system  development  and  use.  A  sustainable 
space exploration system will successfully mediate and  react  to political, organizational, 
and  technical  uncertainty,  and  also  exploit,  to  the  extent  possible,  sources  of  “stability” 
that arise from the interaction of these factors.

2.1.1 Policy Sustainability  
Policy  uncertainty  can  take  the  form  of  changes  in  objectives  or  the  regulatory 
environment  in  which  a  system  must  operate.  It  stems  from  the  dynamic  nature  of  the 
US  government,  and  the  need  for  space  systems  to  suit  both  national/strategic  and 
political/tactical  interests.  Government  programs  are  re-assessed  on  a  yearly  basis  in 
terms  of  national  priorities  and,  in  some  cases,  performance.    Changes  in  the  political 
and  geopolitical  environment  can  alter  the  perception  of  the  value  of  exploration 
activities.  An  important  aspect  of  policy  sustainability  is  thus  the  ability  to  maintain 
relevance,  and  continue  operations,  in  the  face  of  shifting  objectives  and  regulatory 
environments. 
 
To  take  one  example,  while  the  decision  to  build  the  Space  Station  Freedom  was 
motivated largely by Cold War concerns, the fall of the Berlin Wall transformed the ailing 
project  into  a  symbol  for  international  peace  and  cooperation  (Wikipedia,  2004).  To  the 
extent possible,  system designers  should  consider  the  implications of  such  changes  for 
system  operation.  If  a  policy  decision  to  focus  on Mars  rather  than  the Moon  is  likely  in 
the  near  term,  current  designs  should  be  extensible  to  both  objectives.  Similarly,  if 
international cooperation  is based on uncertain agreements, alternatives to  international 
participation on the critical path of development should be available. 

2.1.2   Budgetary Sustainability  
Shifting  political  priorities  also  create  changes  in  funding.  During  its  years  of 
development  and  operations,  a  programs  budget  may  oscillate  unpredictably.  Figure  1 
illustrates how NASA’s budget fluctuates over time.

A  flexible  system  will  maintain  exploration  capability  even  in  the  face  of  budgetary 
fluctuations,  whether  through  changes  in  schedule,  scale  of  operations,  or  by  other 
means. 
 

2.1.3 Organizational Sustainability  
Recent  scholarship  has  investigated  the  relationship  between  organizational  structure 
and  technical design. Charles Perrow (1984) has characterized socio-technical systems 
in  terms  of  their  dynamics  and  complexity,  drawing  conclusions  for  system  safety  and 
reliability.  He  defines  space  systems  as  highly  coupled,  nonlinear,  and  complex. 
Organizational  structure  and  technical  complexity  can  impact  system  reliability  by 
creating  “quite  erroneous  worlds  in  [the]  minds”  of  system  operators  and  managers. 
(Perrow, 1984) 
 
Diane  (1996)  Vaughan  furthers  this  understanding,  suggesting  that  “the  microscopic 
world  of  daily  decisions”  can  create  almost  imperceptible  changes  in  organizational 
culture  over  time, with  important  consequences  for  safety.  Her  term,  the  “normalization 
of  deviance,”  encompasses  the way  in which  expectations  can  change  and  aberrations 
become  accepted,  through  continual  exposure  to  anomalies.  Organizational  structure, 
which  impacts  daily  decisions,  plays  an  important  role  in  system  performance  and 
reliability, and thus sustainability. 
 
A  space  system  will  be  sustainable  from  an  organizational  perspective,  then,  if  the 
technological  system  and  management  structure  are  designed  together  to  minimize 
organizational drift and normalization of deviance.  

2.1.4 Technical Sustainability  
Technical  sustainability  refers  to  system  performance,  reliability,  and  the  potential 
infusion of new  technologies.   An exploration system must support and maintain human 
and  robotic  activity  at  various  fronts  of  exploration,  and  incorporate  technological 
advances  to  continuously  improve  system  performance  without  major  operational 
changes.  Further, any highly complex system  is likely to fail at some point during its life 
cycle. A sustainable system will be one that is robust to failures, both small and large. 
 
An important factor related to technical sustainability is risk tolerance. Risk tolerance 
can be divided into three main areas:  
 

1.  Development risk: during design, test integration of architecture components 
2.  Planning  risk: willingness  to  exploit more  or  less  of  known  system margins while 
planning an exploration mission 
3.  Operations risk: willingness to take risk during operations. 

 
By  definition,  risk-free  exploration  does  not  exist.  System  designers  must  balance  the 
risk  associated  with  architectural  form,  schedule,  and  operations,  in  order  to  achieve 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      18              

 

system  objectives.  Risk  tolerance  can  change  throughout  a  system  life  cycle,  and  thus 
change how a given system is operated. 
 
 

2.2 Sustainable Exploration Systems – Dynamics 
While  each  of  the  three  domains  above  impacts  the  development  and  operations  of 
complex  systems  in  different  ways,  they  are  closely  interrelated.  The  dynamic 
relationship  between  the  three  has  important  ramifications  for  sustainability.    The 
relationship between these three broad domains is shown in Figure 2.  

 

Figure 2: Interaction of political, organizational, and technical factors 
. 
The  Columbia  Shuttle  Accident  Report  (CAIB)  repeatedly  stresses  the  adverse  affects 
that  broader  issues  such  as  indecisive  national  leadership,  increasingly  stretched 
budgets, and  continued mischaracterization of Shuttle  capabilities have had on NASA’s 
organizational and safety culture. 
 
Conversely, Hans Klein has suggested that the characteristics of a technological system 
and development program can  facilitate or  impede coalition politics,  thereby reducing or 
exacerbating  conflicts  between  politics  and  program  administration  (Klein,  2000). 
Technology  and  politics  are  linked  when  program  administrators  translate  political 
forces  into  design  requirements.  Further,  once  developed,  a  given  system  architecture 
together  with  its  supporting  facilities  can  become  “locked-in”  and  perpetuated  through 
later  designs.  The  space  shuttle,  for  example, made  use  of  facilities  designed  partly  as 
the result of short-term political wrangling conducted during the Apollo era (p. 319).

Annalisa  Weigel  and  Daniel  Hastings  have  similarly  investigated  the  interrelation 
between technical design and political change (2003).   Weigel and Hastings stress that 
space  transportation  infrastructures  are  affected  as much  by  political  considerations  as 
technical problems.  It  is  thus  imperative  to understand  the coupling of both domains  if a 
system  is  to  operate  successfully  in  the  “politico-technical”  arena.  Weigel  presents  a 
framework to understand how policy directives couple with technical parameters. Figure 
3 is an “influence diagram” used to illustrate such coupling.

At a different  level, as a  later section of  this chapter notes,  the  interplay between news, 
politics, and  technical development was an  important  factor  in  the evolution of Antarctic 
exploration.    In  this  respect,  designing  for  sustainability  implies  understanding  how 
various  design  decisions  can  lead  to  organizational  and  political  dynamics  that  may 
improve or impeded the flexibility of the system.  

2.3 Sustainability, Flexibility, Robustness 
A  sustainable  system  will  have  attributes  that  allow  it  to  cope  with,  or mediate,  various 
forms  of  uncertainty  throughout  its  life-cycle.  Many  terms  have  been  used  to  define 
characteristics which give systems  these properties. They  include  flexibility, robustness, 
and extensibility.  But what are the relationships between these terms? 
 
In  many  ways  this  is  simply  a  question  of  definition.  Flexibility  can  be  defined  as  the 
ability  of  a  system  to  change  or  be  used  differently  than  intended  after  it  is  initially 
fielded.    Flexibility  can  be  intentional,  but  is  often  unintentional  such  as  in  the  case  of 
the B-52 or  the use of  the LM as a  “life boat”. The speed with which a system  reacts  to 
change  is a measure of agility. Extensibility  is a particular kind of  flexibility. Conversely, 
robustness  is  the  property  of  a  system  that  allows  it  to  be  insensitive  to  change.  A 
 
system is robust if it continues to deliver value in changing circumstances.

All of  these  “ilities” are enabled by attributes of architectural  form. The  follow schematic

2.4 Extensibility – An Enabler of Sustainability 
Extensibility  is defined as  “the property  that new elements can be added  to a system  in 
such  a way  as  to  alter  the  value  delivered.”    (Crawley,  2003)   Designing  systems  to  be 
extensible drives life cycle cost down through anticipating future goal and environmental 
changes  and  then  translating  this  understanding  into  upfront  system  design  actions 
aimed  at  minimizing  overall  life-cycle  cost.    Extensibility  addresses  both  known  and 
unknown  future  changes, with expected payback being  variable, based on  the  certainty 
and  magnitude  of  the  anticipated  change,  along  with  the  cost  associated  with  making 
the system extensible. 
 
Designing  systems  for  extensibility  requires  a  fundamental  shift  in  the  way  design 
decisions  are  made,  a  shift  from  near  optimal  fulfillment  of  immediate  requirements  at 
minimal  cost,  to  minimizing  life  cycle  cost,  maximizing  life-cycle  performance,  etc.    In 
other  words,  an  extensible  design  will  not  be  the  highest  performing  design  when 
compared  to a point design optimized  for a given set of capabilities- a penalty  is placed 
on  ultimate  system  performance  in  order  to  increase  life-cycle  value.    An  extensible 
design  will  not  be  the  lowest  cost  design  under  the  same  conditions  either.    The 
advantages  of  an  extensible  design  are  only  realized  in  the  context  of  multiple 
generations  of  the  system.    New metrics must  be  implemented  for  valuing  the  benefits 
of  extensibility.    In  addition,  a  culture  shift  must  occur  from  near  term  to  longer-term 
expectations of success. 
 
The  large  investment  associated  with  complex  systems  dictates  the  need  for  an 
evolutionary  growth  path,  although  not  all  elements  of  the  system  undergo  the  same 
degree  of  change.    Therefore,  it  is  important  to  invest  “extensibility  dollars”  only  where

      21              

 

needed.  Investing  in extensibility provides an option for future change.  As an example, 
an  in-space  crewed  exploration  vehicle  could  be  designed  for  extensibility  in  terms  of 
number  of  crew  supported  and  days  of  support  through  decoupling  of  living  quarters 
with  the  command  and  control  portion  of  the  spacecraft.   While  the  initial  need may  be 
support  of  a  four-person  crew  for  two  weeks,  this  need  may  extend  to  support  of  six 
people for nine months.  Clearly, using the same vehicle for both missions would unduly 
penalize  the  shorter mission while  design  of  two  separate  vehicles  would  result  in  high 
costs  associated  with  development  of  redundant  functions  such  as  the  command  and 
control  functions.    Separating  the  habitat  functions  from  command  functions  through 
creation  of  two  modules  and  a  common  interface,  for  instance,  would  enable  the 
habitation portion of the spacecraft to be easily modified.  If the change  is executed, the 
implementation  of  the  change  is  expected  to  cost  less  than  if  the  option  had  not  been 
put  into place.    If not executed,  the  extensibility  feature  represents wasted  resources  in 
terms of the expense to implement, reproduce and support the unused feature.   
 
Several  concepts  overlap  almost  directly  with  extensibility-  staged  deployment,  and 
spiral/incremental  development.    Staged  deployment  seeks  to  match  demand  and 
supply  through  scaled  rollout  of  a  system.    Expenses  are  delayed  until  a  later  date, 
reducing  the net present value of  the expense and  increasing  the certainty of  the need, 
at  the  time  of  the  expense.    De  Weck  et  al.  (2004)  describe  staged  deployment  as  a 
potential  alternative  to  full  deployment  of  the  Iridium  communications  satellite  network, 
with  the potential benefit being  lower  investment  in order  to start operations.   Additional 
satellites could have been deployed as demand increased.  While Iridium was ultimately 
displaced  from  most  of  the  expected  market  due  to  widespread  cellular  coverage,  the 
lost investment could have been significantly reduced. 
 
Like staged deployment, spiral development (Figure 4) is also an incremental method of 
deploying new systems and their capabilities in a flexible manner.  Initial capabilities are 
selected  based  on  prioritized  goals,  enabling  quick  deployment  of  high  priority 
capabilities.    Additional  iterations  of  the  process  focus  on  deploying  lower  priority 
capabilities and addressing newly discovered needs.   The  result  is quick deployment of 
primary  capabilities  combined  with  risk  reduction  through  decision  delay  that  enables 
incorporation  of  current  technology  into  new  stages  and  shifts  in  strategy  as  needs

2.4.1 Reasons for Extensibility 
Extensibility  reduces  overall  life-cycle  cost  and/or  increases  life-cycle  performance 
through  a  number  of  difference  paths.    Several  are  listed  below,  along  with  brief 
descriptions. 

2.4.1.1 Management of Technology Obsolescence 
As  the  lifetime  of  a  system  grows,  the  rate  of  change  of  technology  is  increasingly 
mismatched with  the scale of system replacements.  Within a system, different modules 
have  different  rates  of  technological  change.    Charles  Fine  (1998)  uses  the  term 
“clockspeed”  to  describe  the  rate  of  change  and  to  highlight  the  differences  between 
rates  of  change.    Extensible  systems  allow  for  management  of  technological  change 
within  the  system.    As  an  example,  consider  a  vehicle,  such  as  a  spacecraft.    While 
structural  technology  may  undergo  significant  improvements  on  the  timescale  of  a 
decade or more; control system components, especially the electronic elements such as 
logic  chips,  undergo  significant  change  on  an  annual  basis.    Designing  a  system  to 
accommodate  varying  clockspeeds  enables  the  design  to  evolve  over  time.    One 
method  for  accommodating  technological  change  is  through  grouping  components with 
similar  rates  of  change  into  modules,  therefore,  enabling  easy  replacement  of  the 
module, with minimal  impact to other areas.  Ease of change  leads to the ability to keep 
a system modernized. 

2.4.1.2 Risk Mitigation 
Delaying  decisions  improves  the  likelihood  of  making  a  correct  decision.    While  delay 
can  cripple  a  program  if  not  handled  properly,  the  result  of  effective  use  of  delay  is 
confidence in decision-making.

2.4.1.3 Policy Fluctuation Robustness 
Extensibility  is beneficial  in  the  face of  the uncertainties produced by  the policy domain, 
and  the  resulting  budget  fluctuations.    The  potential  for  a  change  in  President  occurs 
once  every  four  years,  a  timescale  much  shorter  than  that  of  an  exploration  program.  
Given  the  mismatch  in  timescales,  it  is  critical  that  achievement  of  intermediate 
milestones provides lasting value, a foundation for future work.   

2.4.2 Describing Extensibility 
Methods  are  needed  for  describing  what  an  extensible  system  is  and  how  the 
extensibility  is  achieved.    Ultimately,  the  metrics  and  descriptions  must  be  quantifiable 
to  enable  trades  to  be  made  between  designs  and  design  options.    Which  system  is 
more extensible?  How extensible is the system? 
 
One  view  of  the  evolution  of  a  system  over  time  is  a  consideration  of  the  relationship 
between available capabilities and required capabilities; in other words, a type of supply 
and  demand  curve.    Figure  5  provides  a  notional  view  of  this  concept.    The  system 
needs over time are represented as a continuous curve.  While the system needs curve 
may  in  fact be discrete,  the aim here  is  to highlight  the high degree of changing need  in 
relation to the ability of the system to change.  The design points represent the available 
capability  levels.    From  a  system  performance  standpoint,  the  ideal  available  capability 
would  be  a  direct  overlay  over  the  needs  curve.    While  the  ideal  curve  cannot  be 
reached  due  to  practical  considerations  such  as  the  cost  of  each  change  (engineering, 
deployment,  etc.),  the  ideal  curve  can  be  approached  through  the  creation  of  an 
extensible  architecture.    This  view  is  closely  related  to  previous  work  in  the  area  of 
staged deployment.  (de Weck et al., 2004).

The  relationship  between  the  supply  and  demand  “curves”  is  an  important  one.    As 
Figure 5  illustrates, a system  that  is overly capable  is  inefficient.   More dollars and  time

have  been  spent  on  unneeded  functionality,  at  the  given  point  in  time.    The  reverse 
situation means  that  the system  is not meeting needs, also a problem.   As an example, 
consider  the  transition  from  Design  2  (D2)  to  Design  3  (D3).    Before  the  transition, 
needs aren’t met by  capabilities, while after  the  transition,  the  system  is over-designed, 
as would  be  expected  immediately  after  an  improvement.   Also note  the  transition  from 
D3  to D4.   While  this  transition was  not  required  to meet  new  capabilities,  since  needs 
have actually decreased, the change was made in order to maintain design efficiency.   
 
In  order  to  analyze  the  evolution  of  a  system  over  time,  a  well-defined  method  of 
describing  change  is  needed.    This  void  can  be  filled  by  a  series  of  operators,  such  as 
those defined by Baldwin and Clark (2000): 
 

•  Splitting (into two or more modules) 
•  Substituting- replace module with a different one 
•  Augmenting (adding a module) 
•  Excluding- removal of a module from the system 
• 
Inverting- creation of new design rules 
•  Porting- use module in another system 

 
The  above  operators  can  be  used  to  perform  all  module-level  operations.    As  was 
mentioned  in  the  previous  section,  it  is  critical  to  realize  that  evolution  is  synonymous 
with  adaptation  or  change,  not  addition.   Continuous  adaptation  to  changing  conditions 
may mean eliminating functionality that is no longer needed; an operation accomplished 
with  the exclusion operator.   As a  simple example of  the use of operators,  consider  the 
creation  of  a  launch  vehicle.    The  augmentation  operator  is  used  to  add  strap-on 
boosters  for  heavy  lift  capability,  while  the  substitution  operator  could  be  used  to 
express the change of a launch fairing.   

2.4.3 Principles Supporting Extensibility 
Four  key  principles  support  extensibility-  modularity,  ideality/simplicity,  independence, 
and  integrability.    These  principles  were  originally  linked  to  “flexibility”  by  Schulz  and 
Fricke (1999) and are briefly summarized below. 

2.4.3.1 Modularity 
The  first  principle  supporting  extensibility  is  modularity,  defined  by  Baldwin  and  Clark 
(2000) as: 
 
“A  module  is  a  unit  whose  structural  elements  are  powerfully  connected  among 
themselves  and  relatively  weakly  connected  to  elements  in  other  units.    Clearly  there 
are degrees of connection, thus there are gradations of modularity.”  (p. 63) 
 
The  principle  of  modularity  enables  complex  problems  to  be  broken  down  through  a 
hierarchical  structure.    Changes  internal  to  a  module  are  isolated  at  the  module 
boundaries, limiting the cascading impacts of a required change.  Expense is reduced in

development,  test,  hardware  exchange,  etc.    Changes  made  to  a  modular  system  can 
be described in terms of the modular operators described in the previous section.   

2.4.3.2 Ideality/Simplicity 
Ideality  is  defined  by  Schulz  and  Fricke  (1999)  as  the  ratio  between  useful  and 
harmful/undesired  effects,  a  notion  of  design  efficiency  (pp.  1.A.2-4,  as  an  additional 
reference,  see  Suh,  2001.)    This  principle  highlights  the  importance  of  the  ongoing 
culling  of  unneeded  functionality  as  a  system  evolves  over  time.    Failure  to  do  so 
increases  system  complexity  unnecessarily,  eventually making  total  replacement  of  the 
system a more effective option than change. 

2.4.3.3 Independence 
The  independence  axiom  derives  from  the  independence  axiom  in  axiomatic  design 
(Suh,  2001).    Each  function  is  satisfied  by  a  different  design  parameter.    Creating  a 
decoupled  design,  in  terms  of  functionality,  produces  a  design  that  is  more  easily 
managed over time. 

2.4.3.4 Integrability 
Integrability  relates  to  the  degree  to  which  a  system’s  interfaces  are  open,  or  flexible.  
Compatibility  between  elements  is  a  critical  enabler  of  flexibility.    As  an  example, 
consider  a  docking  interface  on  the  space  station.    This  interface  would  ideally  be 
common  across  all  future  spacecraft,  ensuring  full  compatibility.    As  an  additional 
example outside the aerospace industry, consider the USB interface standard now used 
by  many  electronic  peripheral  devices  such  as  keyboards,  computer  mice,  flash 
memory  cards,  etc.    The  use  of  dedicated  interfaces  for  each  one  of  these  devices 
would  be  highly  inefficient,  especially  given  the  fact  that  only  a  small  subset  of  the 
devices is needed at any one time. 

2.4.4 Extensibility Summary 
The concept of extensibility is critical to the creation of a sustainable exploration system.  
Extensibility  must  be  an  integral  part  of  the  exploration  strategy  to  ensure  that  forward 
progress  serves  as  a  continually  growing  exploration  foundation,  even  in  light  of  policy 
direction  changes.    The  concepts  of  extensibility  are  woven  into  the  baseline  missions 
and example conceptual designs within this report.  

2.5 Historical Comparison: Antarctic Exploration 
The  history  of  Antarctic  exploration  provides  valuable  lessons  for  space  system 
designers.  From  its  inception  Antarctic  exploration  and  science  shared many  attributes 
and  constraints  with  current  space  activities.  Both,  for  example,  have  been  highly 
dependant  upon  technological  advances,  including  the  need  for  complex  logistics  and 
cutting-edge  life-support  capabilities.  Months  of  isolation  during  Antarctic  expeditions 
present  psychological  hardships  similar  to  those  anticipated  in  extended  Moon  and 
Mars  missions.  More  generally,  Antarctic  exploration,  like  space  activities,  has  brought

      26              

 

science  into close  involvement with politics.   The  following section examines how  these 
factors affected  some aspects  of  the  development  of Antarctic  exploration  and  science, 
and draws lessons for space exploration programs. 

2.5.1 Technology and Logistics: 
 

“More  than  any  other,  Antarctic  science  is  dependant  on  logistics,  on  the  ability  to  place  and 
maintain  a  scientist  and  his  equipment  in  the  right  place  at  the  right  time.  Expeditions  to 
Antarctica  up  to  1925  depended  on  techniques  of  transport,  communication,  survival,  which 
remained  largely  unchanged  for  100  years….  after  1925  the  development  of  mechanized 
transport, the airplane, radio and technology based on better understanding of human physiology, 
were to make access to the Antarctic, travel within it and survival in its hostile environment, much 
less difficult.” (Beck 1986, p.131). 

 
The above quote  summarizes well  the disjointed nature of Antarctic exploration. Rather 
than  follow  a  steady,  continuous  path  of  progress,  the  pace  of  discovery  on  the 
continent  advanced  through  steps  and  jumps.  Importantly,  these  advances  in  capability 
often  resulted  from  the  congruence  multiple  technologies,  rather  than  any  single 
technical  development.  Each  jump  offered  great  advances  in  knowledge  returned  per 
expedition,  a  situation  that  should  be  anticipated  and  exploited  in  the  design  of  space 
exploration systems. 
 
Most  significant  of  these  advances  involves  a  shift  from  what  has  been  termed  the 
“Heroic”  age  to  the  Modern  age  of  Antarctic  exploration.  The  Heroic  age  is  roughly 
delineated as  the period  from 1895  to  the dawn of  the First World War  in 1915  (Walton, 
1987).  It marked a dramatic shift  in capability  from  the previous era because of  the use 
of  liquid  fuel,  however,  due  to  the  still  rather  primitive  methods  of  transport  and  “life 
support,”  expeditions  during  this  period  often  brought  extreme  hardships.  National 
prestige,  sovereignty,  and  personal  fame—not  science—motivated  exploration  during 
this period.  
 
The  Modern  age  begins  roughly  with  the  American  expedition  lead  by  Richard  Evelyn 
Byrd  from  1928-1930.  It  is  characterized  by  the  comprehensive  use  of  airplane  travel, 
electric  communication,  mechanized  transport,  and  thus  continuous  logistical  support 
(Fogg,  1992).  Most  of  these  technologies  had  existed  for  some  time,  and  had  been 
tested  and  refined  through  previous  expeditions.  Byrd’s  expedition  was  the  first  to 
coordinate  them  systematically,  increasing  the  amount  of  data  collected  by  orders  of 
magnitude.  The  following  table  summarizes  the major  technical  advances  that  enabled 
this  shift,  as  well  as  the  impact  on  exploration  capability  and  knowledge  return. 
Systematic  use  is  defined  as  use  in  everyday  operations,  as  opposed  to  sporadic  use 
and testing.

Implications  can  be  drawn  from  these  examples  for  space  exploration.  Advances  fall 
into  rough  classes  of  technologies  with  analogues  in  space  systems.  Combustion 
engines,  which  enabled  the  equivalent  of  surface  rovers,  had  a  great  impact  on  the 
kinds  of  fieldwork  that  could  be  executed.  Their  introduction  created  the  possibility  of 
distributed  use  of  heavy  equipment  for  seismic  operations.  Their  impact  on  mission 
logistics, however, was minimal at first. 
 
The  airplane  and  the  radio  had  dramatic  affects  on  knowledge  return  and  mission 
logistics.  The Byrd expedition was the first to fly over the pole. In doing so, he took over 
1600  pictures  covering  150,000  square  miles,  or  the  equivalent  of  37.5  field  seasons 
worth  of  observations  using  previous  methods  (Walton,  1984).  He  also  discovered  two 
Mountain  ranges.  The  airplane  also  allowed  for  the  possibility  of  pre-positioning  and 
logistical support for inland bases. 
 
Soon after  flying over  the pole, Byrd was able  to communicate  the accomplishment. His 
successful  flight was  beamed  via  radio  immediately  back  to  the United  States,  and  this 
greatly increased US interest in Antarctica (Fogg, 1992). 
 
An  interesting  feature  of  the  progression  of  technological  development  is  the  lag 
between  testing  and  systematic  use. Radio  communication  and  the  combustion  engine 
were tested with little impact in many expeditions before the Byrd expedition.

Interestingly,  life  support  capabilities  advance  much  more  gradually  than  logistics 
technology.  Man  learned  to  live  the  extreme  environment  gradually,  over  several 
hundred  years,  with  advances  coming  more  through  trial  and  error  than  scientific  or 
technological breakthrough. (Fogg, 1992) 
 
In  many  ways,  NASA’s  current  task  is  to  transition  space  activities  from  a  heroic  to  a 
modern  age. While  national  prestige  and  public  attention will  continue  to  play  important 
roles  in  space  activities,  the  time  has  come  for more  systematic  and  knowledge  return. 
The  history  of  Antarctic  exploration  demonstrates  that when  this  occurs,  as  in  the  case 
with  the  first  Byrd  expedition,  public  attention  and  government  funding  are  likely  to 
increase  rather  that  decrease.  The  next  section  examines  this  dynamic  of  science  and 
politics. 

2.5.2 Politics and Technology 
Antarctic  exploration  requires  support  at  the  national  level.  Thus,  as  one  author  notes, 
“Antarctic  scientists  have  often  been  used  as  political  instruments  and  it  would  be 
unrealistic  for  them  to  think  that  their work  can  be  isolated  from  the  spheres  of  interest 
of  economics,  law,  and  politics.”(Klein  2000,  p.319)    The  motivations  behind  various 
stages  of  Antarctic  exploration  are  extraordinary  in  their  similarity  to  space  activities. 
They  include  included:  prestige  of  geographical  discovery,  information  and  experience 
for  navigation  and  commerce,  and  sovereignty.  While  science  always  played  an 
important  role  during  expeditions,  and  is  now  the  single  most  important  product  of 
exploration, it is important to note that the underlying motivation for countries to invest in 
Antarctic  travel  has  almost  always  been  the  “maximization  of  influence”  rather  than 
knowledge (Lee, personal communication). 
 
Territorial  issues  became  increasingly  important  at  the  transition  from  the  Heroic  to 
Modern  age  of  Antarctic  exploration.  From  1908  until  the  signing  of  the  Antarctic  treaty 
in  1961,  international  tension  rose  and  fell  as  countries  made  varied  and  conflicting 
claims to sovereignty. The following events in particular were important to this dynamic. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
While  the  motivations  behind  these  claims  were  complex  and  interrelated,  the  World 
Wars  and  advances  in  technological  capability  were  certainly  central  factors.  As  with 
space  activities  during  the  Apollo  Era,  international  interest,  enabled  by  technological 
advances, fueled funding for exploration. 
 
Byrd’s expeditions are a particularly  interesting example of  this kind of  feedback  loop  in 
the  US.  As  mentioned  above,  Byrd  was  the  first  to  systematically  incorporate  modern 
logistical  technology  in  his  1928  expedition.  This  mission  and  second  following  it  were 
funded  privately.  Their  success  captured  the  public  attention,  increasing  US  popular 

1908 and again in 1907 Britain issued formal territorial claim 
1923 British claim the Roth Dependency 
1924 French claim Adelie land 
1933 Australia makes claim 
 ~1939 Norway claims Dronning Maud Land

interest  in  Antarctic  exploration.  (Fogg,  1984).  At  the  same  time  increasing  territorial 
claims  and  impending  war  on  the  European  sharpened  political  and military  perception 
of the strategic value of access Antarctica. The result was that Byrd’s third expedition, in 
1939,  was  funded  publicly  and  had  the  attention  of  President  Roosevelt  himself.  In  a 
letter  to Byrd  in 1939, Roosevelt explicitly stated  the confluence of  interests  that  lead  to 
public funding: 
 

“The most  important thing  is to prove (a) that human beings can permanently occupy a portion of 
Continent  winter  and  summer;  (b)  that  it  is  well  worth  a  small  annual  appropriation  to  maintain 
such permanent bases because of their growing value for four purposes—national defense of the 
Western Hemisphere,  radio, meteorology, and minerals. Each of  these  is of  approximately equal 
importance as far as we know.” (Fogg, 1984, p.162) 

 
Following  the Second World War,  international  interest  in Antarctica  increased  together 
with  improved  access.  Antarctica  exploration  was  facilitated  by  the  use  of  ships 
designed  specifically  for  working  in  ice,  including  modern  ice-breakers.  (Walton,  1987) 
In the tense environment of the Cold War, the ability to access Antarctica, much as with 
space,  was  itself  justification  for  doing  so.  As  is  often  the  case,  science  was  the  veil 
behind  which  these  interests  developed.  One  state  department  official,  Henry  Dater, 
makes clear how these issues were interrelated in a letter he wrote in 1959: 
 

“Because of  its position of  leadership  in  the Free World,  it  is evident  that  the United States could 
not  now  withdraw  from  the  Antarctic…national  prestige  has  been  committed….  our  capacity  for 
sustaining  and  leading  an  international  endeavor  there  that  will  benefit  all  mankind  is  being 
watched  not  only  by  those  nations  with  us  in  the  Antarctic  but  also  by  noncommitted  nations 
everywhere.  Antarctic  simply  cannot  be  separated  from  the  global  matrix.  Science  is  the  shield 
behind which these activities are carried out.” (Beck, 1986 p. 64) 

 
While  this  view  is  a  product  of  the  geopolitical  context,  it  illustrates  how  various  factors 
can  coalesce  to  form  a  sustainable  program  from  a  political  perspective.  The  Byrd 
expeditions  from  before  WWII  had  demonstrated  American  technical  superiority  in 
exploration  and  proven  that  modern  technologies  could  be  used  to  improve  access  to 
the  continent.  After  the  war,  politicians  and  diplomats  began  to  view  exploration  as  an 
important  symbol  for  global  cooperation  and  competition,  and  were  committed  to 
continuing  operations.    Once  implicated,  national  prestige  and  technical  capability 
became intermingled, heightening the perception of value of continuing exploration.  
 
Conclusions – Exploration and Sustainability 
An  important  lesson  that  the  history  of  Antarctic  exploration  provides  for  space 
exploration  system  designers  involves  the  interplay  between  news,  knowledge, 
technology, and  funding. While Arctic exploration progressed slowly  for decades,  it was 
marked  by  distinct  stages  of  increasing  capability  and  increased  interest.  As  the  Byrd 
expedition  illustrates,  quite  often  advances  in  logistical  and  knowledge  acquisition  and 
transfer  capability  translate  to  increased  political  interest  and  funding.  The  spread  of 
news creates public interest, while increased knowledge and logistical capability creates 
military  interest.  Both  can  generate  funding  for  further  expeditions,  thus  creating  a 
positive  feedback  loop  of  discovery  and  technological  development.  Figure  6  illustrates 
the salient aspects of the feedback loop, which enabled the Byrd expeditions.

Of  course  the  real  dynamics  behind  such  a  process  are  complex  and  varied.  Byrd’s 
expedition occurred at a time when international interest in Antarctica was increasing for 
many  reasons. Still,  these  reasons are at  least enabled,  if not  intimately connected with 
increasing  logistical  capability  and  knowledge  creation.  Such  dynamics  are  worth 
investigating for the sake of creating successful exploration systems in the future. 

 

2.6 Designing for Sustainability: A Process 
 
MIT’s 2004 spring class  in Space Systems Design  investigated  the design of extensible 
space  system  architectures.  A  central  difficulty  in  this  task was  the  shear  complexity  of 
the problem, and the lack of an established methodology to design system architectures. 
An  important  result  of  the  investigations  was  thus  the methods  developed  to  approach 
the  problem,  and  the  process  by  which  “sustainability”  could  become  central  to  design 
decisions.  The  end  result  was  an  iterative  and  holistic  approach  to  the  problem,  which 
will hopefully inform future space systems architecture projects.  
 
It  should  be  stressed  that  not  every  aspect  of  the  process  described  was  completed 
rigorously  during  the  semester.  Rather,  the  process  represents  a  way  to  integrate  the 
lessons  learned  and  eventually  create  a  systematic  architectural  design.  Of  course 
every element of this process did not proceed in clear and neat steps. Most of the steps 
were iterative within themselves, and individual elements were re-worked as   
 
The  underlying  goal  of  the  design  process  was  to  develop  an  integrated  strategy  that 
could  quantify  how  the  system  reacted  to  changes  in  the  environment.  Rather  than

create  a  point  design  to  accomplish  a  Moon  or  Mars  expedition,  the  class  wanted  to 
demonstrate  that  various  scenarios  could  be  anticipated  and  addressed  during 
conceptual  design  and,  as  importantly,  that  the  elements  designed  to  address  these 
scenarios  (which  would  likely  make  the  system  sub-optimal  from  a  point-design 
perspective) could be justified quantitatively. A strategy includes various scales of Moon 
and Mars missions, robotic scout missions, and considers the program changes such as 
budget cuts and regulatory constraints.  
 
Figure  7  illustrates  the  five  step  process  arrived  at  to  create  the  strategy.  An  important 
goal was the establishment of common operations and across manned Moon, Mars and 
potentially  asteroid  missions,  as  well  as  through  stages  of  missions  at  each  body. 
Common  elements  defined  baseline  architecture  forms  and  operations,  from  which 
options could be created to address specific missions and changing scenarios.  

The  first  three  steps  in  the  process  identify  common  forms  and  functions  needed  to 
explore  the Moon, Mars  and  other  destinations.  Two  teams  conceived  of  staged Moon 
and  Mars  missions,  and  created  matrices  with  functional  requirements  for  each  stage. 
With  these  functional  requirements, a  simple Venn diagram  captures  the  relationship of 
requirements  between  the  Moon  and  Mars.  An  interesting  feature  of  this  part  of  the 
process  involves  the  ability  to  identify  how  formal  elements  can  be  extracted  from 
functional  requirements  based  on  commonality  between  Moon  and  Mars  needs  at

various  levels.  “Options”  can  be  created  to  supplement  the  core  needs,  based  on 
requirements outside of the intersection of the circles. 
 
Functional  Commonality  Mapping  thus  revises  the  forms  created  to  enable  various 
Missions.  The  two  teams  must  then  return  to  the  mission  storylines  and  establish  how 
and whether mission objectives can still be met with  the revised  forms, and alter staged 
missions  accordingly.  This  iterative  process  can  continue  until  a  satisfactory  level  of 
refinement is achieved. 
 
It  was  found  that  this  iterative  part  of  the  process  reveals  key  trades  that  need  to  be 
made with  respect  to  commonality  and  architecture  operations.   Based  on  our  designs, 
trades  on  issues  such  lander  design,  rover  design,  aerobraking  capability,  and 
operational  capability  processes  such  as  the  use  of  the  Earth-Moon  Lagrangian  points, 
could  not  be  solved  by  commonality  mapping  alone.  The  next  step  of  the  process  is 
thus to evaluate the key trades revealed by the first three steps of the process.  
 
In order  to create a  flexible strategy, however,  it was  important  to evaluate  these  trades 
with  consideration  for  the  value  of  flexibility  and  robustness,  not  just  optimality.  Tool 
such  as  real-options, multi-attribute  utility  theory,  and  decision  analysis,  can  be  used  to 
carry  out  the  trades  while  preserving  system  flexibility,  thus  creating  a  rigorous 
development strategy and architecture.  
 
Chapter  6  addresses  how  these  tools  can  be  used  to  evaluate  strategic  and  technical 
options.  The  strategy  includes  staged  deployment  of  Moon  and  Mars  missions,  with 
development options forming branches from the baseline mission. Ideally the aspects of 
the  system  designed  early  in  the  strategy  will  minimize  the  need  for  redesign  if  new 
directions in the strategy are taken. 
 
As noted, the full strategy was not generated during this design course. Instead, various 
aspects  of  the  process  were  addressed  and  tools  were  conceived  to  facilitate  their 
design in later studies.

3.  Knowledge Delivery:  The Core of Exploration 

 

3.1  Explanation of the view 
An  extensible  space  exploration 
infrastructure  may  be  modeled  as  a  mass 
transportation  system,  but  also  as  a  knowledge  delivery  system,  since  mankind  is 
sending  robotic  and  human  explorers  to  space  for  the  purpose  of  exploring  and 
returning knowledge about the Moon, Mars and Beyond. 
 
To  justify  knowledge  as  the  deliverable  to  the  stakeholders  one  must  investigate  why 
knowledge  is  the  deliverable  and  who  the  stakeholders  are.    To  answer  the  first 
question,  one must  first  understand why  do  humans  explore.    To  summarize,  the  three 
main reasons are 
 

1.  To expand the knowledge of our surroundings 
2.  To improve the technological leadership of the United States 
3.  To inspire interest in science and technology 

 
Knowledge  is  the  product  of  the  exploration  process.    The  knowledge  of  our 
surroundings  is  closely  tied  to  science.    Technological  leadership  is  knowledge 
delivered  to  the  technologist and explorers.   The  third point  is  that  inspiration  in science 
and  technology  is  the  knowledge  delivered  to  public  and  commercial  enterprises.    In 
other words,  the knowledge gained by  the space exploration system  is  the value-added 
delivery  to  the  beneficiaries  or  stakeholders.    Therefore,  to  ensure  the maximum  value 
delivery,  one  may  model  the  space  infrastructure  as  a  knowledge  delivery  system. 
Knowledge  returned  may  be  categorized  as  scientific  knowledge,  resource  related 
knowledge,  technical  knowledge,  and  planning  related  knowledge.    To  build  up  the 
argument,  first  one  must  understand  the  value  delivery  to  the  scientists,  which  is 
diagramed  in  Figure  8.    To  understand  the  value  identification,  the  goal  of  the  space 
infrastructure  is  to  increase  the  quantity  and  depth  of  scientific  knowledge  of  the  solar 
system  by  sustainably  and  successfully  exploring  the  solar  system,  specifically  the 
Earth,  Moon,  Mars,  and  Asteroids  (EMMA)  using  an  affordable  and  extensible  human 
and robotic exploration system for the immediate benefit of the scientific community.

Figure 8: Value delivery to scientists diagram 

 
The value delivered to the technologists and explorers is an increase in the quantity and 
depth  of  resource  and  planning  related  knowledge  of  the  solar  system  by  sustainably 
and  successfully  exploring  the  solar  system,  specifically  the EMMA  using  an  affordable 
and  extensible  human  and  robotic  exploration  system,  and  the  previously  gained 
resource.  The value delivery can also be seen in Figure 9. 
 

 

Figure 9: Value delivery to technologist/explorers diagram 
 
In addition  to  the scientists and  technologists/explorers, knowledge may be  returned  for  
the  benefit  of  the  United  States  public  and  mankind.      NASA  and  the  US  government, 
international  partners  and  commercial  enterprises  may  derive  additional  knowledge 
benefit.  The full objective process methodology map is shown in Figure 10.

3.2  Types of Knowledge 
There are five main types of knowledge: Scientific-, Resource-, Technical-, Operational-, 
and Experience-related knowledge as seen in Figure 11.

      36              

 

Figure 11: Five types of knowledge 

 

3.2.1  Scientific Knowledge 
Scientific  knowledge  can  be  generalized  as  the  search  for  the  existence  of  life  and 
Planetary E3 (the characterization of Evolution, Environment, and Existability of a planet 
or  any  celestial  body).    The  existence  of  past  or  present  life  drives  the  search  for 
resources  such  as  water  and  other  biomarkers.  Evolution  is  mainly  concerned  with 
understanding the geology of a planet while Environment is the climate characterization.  
Existability  is an assessment of biological potential, or how benign or hostile a planet  is 
to human settlement.   
 
One  way  to  quantify  scientific  knowledge  is  through  keeping  track  of  the  number  of 
scientific  publications  resulting  from  the  exploration  effort.    This  is  “an  accepted 
measure  of  scientific  productivity”  and  can  be  easily  tracked  using  databases  such  as 
the NASA Astrophysics Data System  (ADS)  (Green, 2004).   An example of  this  is seen 
in  Figure  12,  which  captures  the  number  of  papers  published  as  a  function  of  the 
publication year for the Hubble Space Telescope. Using a numeric quantity, such as the 
number  of  publications,  it  is  possible  to  make  comparisons  between  different 
exploratory  missions.    It  is  then  possible  to  understand  when  a  diminishing  amount  of 
knowledge  is  returned  and  when  it may  be  beneficial  to  gracefully  retire  an  exploration 
mission.  For example, if as in Figure 12, the number of papers per year were to steadily 
decrease  for  several  consecutive  years,  the  exploratory  phase  of  the mission would  be

      37              

 

approaching its end.  The final result of the knowledge publication graph might resemble 
a Gaussian distribution, where  a mission  is  retired after  it  reaches a  certain point  in  the 
distribution.  Other possibilities for measuring scientific knowledge include news articles, 
press  releases,  website  hits,  educational  television  programs,  PhD  dissertations,  or 
proposals.

3.2.2 Resource Knowledge 
tion,  and  amount  of  planetary 
Resource  knowledge  is  defined  by  the  existence,  loca
resources  that  can  be  utilized  by  human  explorers.    These  indigenous  resources  are 
necessary  to  build  and  maintain  an  extensible  space  infrastructure.    Possible 
indigenous  resources  include  water,  Oxygen,  Hydrogen,  Ores/major  metals,  Nitrogen, 
and  energy  sources  such  as  fusion materials.  These  resources may  be  obtained  using 
the following three-step strategy: 
 
1
.    Existence.    The  first  step  to  is  to    determine  the  existence  of  the  resource, 
ikely  using  robotic  explorers  such  as  orbiters.    First,  implied  existence  of  the 
most  l
resource  is obtained by  knowledge  carriers, which  transmit passive bits.   The next  step 
is  to  obtain  direct  proof  of  the  resource’s  existence,  either  by  transmitting  bits  or  by 
transporting atoms. 
2. Location an
d Amount.   The  second  step  is  to   determine  the global amount of 
urce,  possibly  using  an  orbiter  or  rover.    An  unmanned  rover  is  beneficial  for 
a  reso
reconnaissance  of  biohazardous  and  toxic  regions.    As  the  resolution  of  resource 
knowledge  about 
increases  with 
locations  and  amounts 
the  specific  resource 
exploration, a point is reached when a human mission may begin to extract the resource.  
This  point would  occur when  the  resource  location  accuracy  at  least meets  the  landing 
accuracy plus the travel distance of a human mission. 
3.    In-situ  Utilization.    The  final  step  is  to  beg
in  in-situ  resource  utilization  for 
tion  needs,  such  as  propellant,  building  materials,  and  energy.    A  lander  can 
explora
achieve  basic  in-situ  knowledge,  but  full  exploitation  will  likely  occur  with  a  human 
mission.    Some  of  the  issues  with  in-situ  utilization  are  related  to  the  degree  of 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      38              

 

manipulation needed.  For example possible water ice on the Moon may need a heating, 
purification, and extraction process before it is useable. 

3.2.3 Technical Knowledge 
sessment  of  the  engineering  abilities  associated with  the 
Technical  knowledge  is  the  as
space  transportation  system  similar  to  the  NASA  Technology  Readiness  Levels  (TRL).  
The  space  transportation  system  will  slowly  attempt  to  integrate  various  new 
technologies  into  the  existing  infrastructure.    The  level  of  working  ability  for  each 
technology  is  the  technical knowledge delivered.   An example  is  the development of  in-
situ resource technology, where currently designs exist at various conceptual levels.  As 
the  system  is  developed,  in-situ  resources  can  be  utilized.    The  degree  of  success  
delivered,  measured  in  cycle  efficiency,  total  power  consumption,  and  resource 
produced  by  the  in-situ  technology  is  the  technical  knowledge.    Technical  knowledge 
gained will affect the evolution of the space transportation system.  It will help determine 
how missions grow, which will be discussed in later sections. 

3.2.4 Operational Knowledge 
Operational  knowledge  is  the  c
apability  of  performing  activities  related  to  the  space 
transportation system.  An example of operational knowledge obtained during the Apollo 
program  is  lunar orbit  rendezvous, or docking.   The  technology  for  docking  existed  and 
the procedure for it was known, but not until it was successfully accomplished was there 
a  large  amount  of  operational  knowledge  gained  concerning  docking.    Other  examples 
include operational  knowledge gained  from Lagrange point maneuvers, pre-positioning, 
drilling  in  low  gravity  environments,  and  long  duration  human  factors  issues.        An 
interesting  point  about  operational  knowledge  is  that  unlike  the  previous  types  of 
knowledge,  a  good  deal  can  be  gained  from  failures.    For  example,  during  Apollo  13, 
operational  knowledge  was  gained  when  the  Lunar  Module  was  used  as  a  “life  boat” 
and  various  components  were  also  creatively  utilized  to  ensure  crew  survivability.    It  is 
uses  of  a  system  beyond  their  intended  designs,  which  can  lead  to  operational 
knowledge.    Therefore  operational  knowledge  can  be  gained  by  understanding  the 
flexibility of a system. 
 

3.2.5 Experience Knowledge 
The human experience can also
 be a type of knowledge, because there is a unique gain 
that  is  achieved  outside  of  data  or  physical  returns.    It  is  may  be  thought  of  as  a 
combination  of  the  four  other  types  of  knowledge.    A  human  presence  can  gain 
knowledge  that  is  different  from  any  robotic  explorer  or  remote  sensor  due  to  its  rapid 
cognitive  thinking and senses.   This  idea  is very similar  to  the notion of experience as a 
knowledge carrier, which is outlined in Section 2.3.3. 

3.3 Carriers of Knowledge 
Carriers  of  knowledge  are  divided  into  three  main  categories,  bits,  atoms,  and  human 
experience. 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      39              

 

3.3.1 Bits 
owledge  in  the  form  of  the  data.    There  are  two  types  of  bits,  passive  bits 
Bits  carry  kn
by  data  obtained  without  interacting  with  the 
and  active  bits.    Passive  bits  are  defined 
nvironment,  such as  taking a picture.   Active bits  involve  interacting with  the 
observed e
environment  such  as  by  taking  a measurement  and  transmitting  the measurement  data 
back. 

3.3.2 Atoms 
Atoms 
are  the  physical  samples  that  carry  knowledge  about  an  exploration  excursion.  
These  samples  carry  two  forms  of  knowl
edge:  implied  discoveries  and  direct  proof 
discoveries.   
An  implied  discovery  is  knowledge  that  is  gained  by  observation  or 
measurement  of  a  sample,  which  leads  to  an  implicit  discovery;  for  example,  a 
weathered  rock  exhibiting  the  past  existence  of  water  by  erosion  patterns.    A  direct 
proof  discovery  is  the  knowledge  carried  by  hard  evidence  of  a  phenomenon,  for 
example,  a  Mars  rock  with  a  pocket  of  water  carries  proof  of  Martian  water  by  direct 
observation of the specimen. 

3.3.3 The Human Experience 
The  human  experience  of  ex
ploration  has  the  ability  to  carry  the  greatest  amount  of 
knowledge.  While robotic explor
ers could be the prime means of bringing back bits and 
atoms,  they  are  most  effective
  for  large  amounts  of  systematic  returns.    In  contrast, 
there  are  three  human  physiological  traits  that  provide  an  optimal  combination  for 
returning knowledge: 
1.  The human brain.   Capable of instantaneous programming, the human brain 
is a “qualitative supercomputer” (Schmitt, personal communication).  It can 
react to field
 experience and training and adds a high degree of flexibility 
2.  Eyes.  The human eyes have high mobility, dynamic range, and quick three-
dimensional integration, especially in the 10 – 15 meter range (Schmitt, 
personal communication). 
3.  Hands.  Perhaps the most underutilized human tool, but if their dexterity can 
be used to their full potential they can greatly increase the human explor
ation 
ability. For example, hands
 posses the capability of returning detailed tactile 
feedback, etc.  

 
ple  of  the  benefit  of  the  human  experience  can  be  seen  in  the  NASA
An  exam
 
Opportunity  Rover  on  Mars.    Throughout  its  mission,  it  has  returned  knowledge  by 
observation  and  interaction with  the  environment  (bits),  but  it  has  sent  back  even more 
questions  about  Mars.    These  questions  could  have  been  answered  immediately  by  a 
human  field  geologist  present  on  Mars,  due  to  his/her  unique  ability  to  analyze  the 
environment  with  his/her  experience,  physiological 
tools,  and  basic  scientific 
instruments, such as a hammer (Schmitt, personal communication). 
 
Robotic  and  human  explorers  have  different  degrees  of  time  and  spatial  processing 
abilities,  as  seen  in  Figure  13.    Time  processing  ability  is meant  by 
how  an  explorer  is 
a
ble  to  take  in  and  understand  the  value  of  interesting  exploration  targets.    Spatial 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      40              

 

processing  is  defined  as  the  ability  to  understand  the  value  of  exploration  targets  in  a 
global  resolution  and  also  a  high-resolution  sense.    Figure  13  shows  three  types  of 
robotic  explorers,  penetrators,  orbiters,  and  rovers. 
  Penetrators  are  geologic 
instruments  that  are  embedded  in  the  ground  and  have  no  mobility.    An  example  of  a 
penetrator is the Deep Space 2 probes.  Penetrators cannot move and only have spatial 
resolution  of  their  immediate  surrounding,  and  rely  on  their  instruments  to  record  data 
as  it comes to them.  They passively gather data and have  limited range to  interact with 
the  environment  and  collect  additional  data.    In  addition,  penetrators  are  not 
reprogrammable  (yet),  once  they  land,  they  execute  their  specified  tasks.    Therefore 
they are shown  to have  low  time and spatial processing abilities.   Orbiters have a  large 
global  resolution, however  they are unable  to achieve high  resolution of specific  targets 
(yet)  or  look  at  a  target  from  multiple  unique  angles.    An  example  of  an  orbiter’s 
limitation  is  that,  it  would  have  a  difficult  time  looking  inside  a  cavern.    Rovers  are 
shown  with  greater  spatial  processing  ability  because  they  are  able  to  look  at  targets 
from  multiple  viewpoints  and  with  a  high  resolution.    They  cannot  achieve  the  global 
scale  resolution of an orbiter, however with  increased mobility and presence  rovers can 
attempt  to  create  a  larger  global  picture  with  high  resolution.    Rovers  are  also  shown 
with  higher  time  processing  ability  because  they  can  be  flexible  to  their  environment.  
They  can  take  a  picture  of  their  surroundings,  and  then  be  commanded  to  move  to 
locations  they  seem  the  most  interesting.    In  contrast,  an  orbiter  can  only  explore 
targets  that  are  in  its  orbit’s  coverage  region.    Finally,  the  human  field  geologist 
equipped  with  a  rover  and  tools  such  as  a microscope  has  the  highest  amount  of  time 
processing  ability  due  to  his  training,  experience,  and  brain.    Equipping  the  human 
explorer  with  high  mobility  (rovers)  and  microscopes,  will  give  him  the  ability  to  have 
global  resolution and high specific  resolution of  targets.   Therefore, a human explorer  is 
the  optimal  combination  of  time  processing  ability  and  spatial  processing  ability.    This 
forms an argument for exploration by humans in place of robotic systems.

Figure  14  illustrates  a  summary  of  the  knowledge  carriers  and  how  they  are  related  by 
their  degree  of  interaction  with  the  environment,  and  the  quantity  of  that  specific 
knowledge  carrier  that  mankind  has  accumulated.    Passive  bits  are  represented  by 
pictures  of  planets  and  the  galaxy  and  currently  carry  the  most  knowledge.    In 
decreasing  amounts  of  quantity  are  active  bits  represented  by  graphs  of Mars  Seismic 
activity from Voyager, followed by pictures of Mars rocks from the Opportunity rovers.  A 
Moon rock represents sample return, which is solely from the Moon.  Finally, the human 
experience  has  the  highest  degree  of  interaction  with  an  exploration  environment; 
however,  it  is  limited  to  the Apollo  excursions.    The  yellow  curve  illustrates  the  utility  of 
the  knowledge  carriers  for  our  current  state  of  exploration.    If  exploration  is  to  be 
successful  in  returning  larger  amount  of  knowledge,  the  red  curve  illustrates  possible 
outcomes of an extensible space architecture.

3.4 Knowledge vs. News 
One  challenge  for  the  knowledge  delivery  system  is  to  understand  the  difference 
between  knowledge  and  news.    To  first  order,  news  is  the  unique  knowledge  on  a 
generalized  subject.    For  example,  the  discovery  of  an  extrasolar  planet  is  news; 
however,  discovery  of  the  nth  extrasolar  planet  is  not  news  to  the  public.    News  is  the 
knowledge  that  immediately  appeals  to  the  public.    A  notional  graph  of  news  versus 
exploration milestones can be seen in Figure 15.  Shown are theoretical news values for 
Apollo and future milestones.  The diagram shows the notion that a new milestone, such 
as  the  first Apollo mission will  have  a  high  news  value,  but  there  is  a  decay  in  news  as 
the  Apollo  missions  progress,  shown  by  the  decaying  black  line.    If  there  is  a  new 
unique  milestone,  such  as  a  human  Moon  return  or  a  1st  Mars  Human  Landing,  it  is 
possible  that  there will  be  a  large  increase  in  the  news  they  generate.   As with   Apollo, 
these events will be  followed by a decrease  in news value, since  the 2nd and 3rd human 
Moon  return  and  2nd  and  3rd  Mars  human  landing  will  not  be  new  milestones.    The 
notional  diagram  exhibits  this  high  frequency  decay.    Overall,  there  is  a  low  frequency 
decay in news value of the entire exploration system.  Thus if the media does follow this 
trend, it is unfavorable for sustainability.

Figure 15: Theoretical news value as the space exploration system evolves 

 
An  important  distinction  may  be  drawn  between  public  interest  and  media  interest.  
When  the  media  loses  interest  in  a  subject,  the  public  tends  to  lose  awareness  of  it.  
The  media  interest  is  also  one  of  the  main  processes  of  continuing  education  that  the 
knowledge  delivery  system  uses.    For  the  system  to  be  most  effective,  the  public 
interest  could  be  coupled  with  education,  but  decoupled  from  the  media.    A  gradual 
increase  in public  interest  is necessary to create a knowledge distribution system that  is 
independent  of  media.    A  challenge  to  this  solution  is  that  many  politicians,  who 
advocate  for  funding,  tend  to  have  some  of  the  strongest  associations  with  the  media.  
A  breakthrough  in  separating  public  interest  from  media  interest  can  occur  when 
personal  connections  with  the  space  transportation  architecture  are  developed.    For 
example, when settlements, be  they permanent or semi-permanent, exist outside of  the 
Earth, many people on Earth will have personal connections with  those on  the Moon or 
Mars  generating  interest  that  is  independent  of  the  media.    A  breakthrough  can  occur 
when there is commercial interest in the Moon and Mars.   
 
It is important that the knowledge delivery system does not rely too heavily on the media.  
The  media  loves  success,  the  first  time,  but  in  general  it  looks  for  disaster  (Schmitt, 
personal  communication).    A  good  example may  be  found  in  the  Apollo missions.    The 
media  coverage  of  Apollo  8  and  11  was  huge,  since  these  missions    achieved  historic 
firsts.  Coverage was also large for Apollo 13 because of its challenges, and then Apollo 
14  since  it  was  the  first  after  a  disaster.    However  the  later  Apollo  missions  did  not 
experience such significant media coverage.

3.5 Knowledge Delivery Process Map 
The  knowledge  delivery  process  can  be  summarized  by  the CDIO  phrase/process with 
an added S at  the end.   These  letters stand  for Conceive, Design,  Implement, Operate, 
and  Science.    During  the  Conceive  stage  the  mission  goals,  requirements  and  trades 
are  identified,  then  during  the  Design  stage  the  goals  and  requirements  are  used  to 
create an comprehensive design of the mission and all the elements that are required to 
make  it  successful.    The  Implementation  stage  consists  of  the  building  of  the  elements 
designed  in  the  previous  stage.  During  the  operate  stage  the  mission  will  collect  the 
data  that will  eventually  be  turned  into  knowledge  during  the Science  stage.   Of  course 
there  is  some  overlap  in    the  stages,  but  for  the  most  part  each  stage  acts  as  its  own 
step  in  the  knowledge  delivery  process.    Each  mission  in  an  extensible  exploration 
system  must  follow  this  pattern,  which  should  begin  to  repeat  at  about  the  time  that 
previous mission has reached the O stage.  The estimated relative times for each stage 
for robotic, human Mars and Moon missions are given in Table 1.

In the above Table 1, n stands for a constant amount of time that should be between six 
months  and  one  year.    The  amount  of  time  that  it  takes  to  evaluate  and  handle  raw 
science  data  is  less  on  a  human mission  than  on  a  robotic  one.   After  the  first  round  of 
missions,  the  relative  times  should  change  slightly,  especially  if  there  is  any  form  of 
reusability added into the system. 

3.6  Knowledge Delivery Time  
The  Knowledge  Delivery  process  is  summarized  in  Figure  16,  which  shows  the  overall 
knowledge  delivery  cycle  and  introduces  the  concept  of  Knowledge  Delivery  Time 
(KDT).  There is some time difference between the beginning exploration phase and the 
knowledge delivery.  The primary mission can directly lead to mission delivery shown by 
the  dotted  line  in  Figure  16,  or  knowledge  processing  on  Earth,  after  the  primary 
mission on Earth can then lead to knowledge delivery.  After knowledge is delivered, the 
exploration  cycle  begins  again  with  another  conceive,  design,  Implement,  and  operate 
processes.

Figure 16: Knowledge delivery cycle 

 
Knowledge delivery  time  is defined as  the  time between collection of knowledge and  its 
delivery.  It  is  usually  not  instantaneous.    Two  case  scenarios,  illustrated  in  Figure  17, 
can be used to understand the concept of knowledge delivery time. 
 

 

 

Figure 17: Knowledge delivery time examples 

 
For  Mars  Global  Surveyor  (MGS),  there  is  a  time  difference  between  orbital  insertion, 
which  represents  when  exploration  and  the  collection  of  knowledge  begins,  to  the 
delivery  of  a  significant  amount  of  knowledge,  in  the  form  of  a  journal  paper  discussing 
the  existence  of water  on Mars.   Pictures  from Mars  from MGS, which  are  passive  bits 
knowledge  carriers,  were  used  for  the  discovery  (Malin,  2000).    The  KDT  from  initial 
exploration  to knowledge  return was approximately 35 months.   The next exploration of 
Mars with the objective of determining recent Mars water was the Spirit and Opportunity 
rovers.    Knowledge  delivered  by  the  rovers  was  the  indirect  verification  of  recent  Mars 
water  by  pictures  (passive  bits)  and  by  drilling  (active  bits).    The  knowledge  delivery 
time  between  the  two  results  of  the  two  knowledge  carriers,  passive  and  active  bits,  is 
approximately  43 months.  Thus,  the  total KDT  is  about  six  and  a  half  years.   The Keck 
Interferometer  also  exhibits  a  KDT  in  a  range  similar  to  that  used  by  the  Mars  rovers; 
approximately  33  months  between  the  start  of  exploration  when  first  light  is  achieved 
and its first published science observation (Keck website, 2004). 
 
The  following  examples  of  KDT  come  from  robotic  missions.  Therefore,  future  robotic 
explorers  could  have  similar  knowledge  delivery  times.    The  benefit  of  human 
exploration  is  that  it  has  the  ability  to  decrease  and  even  eliminate  the  knowledge 
delivery  time.    The  human  exploration  experience  can  process  and  interact  with  the 
environment  rapidly and  return knowledge with minimal delay.   For example,  the Apollo 
explorers  could  immediately  determine  that  lunar  regolith  (to  first  order)  was  mainly 
composed of  inert dust and  rock  fragments verifying knowledge  from photos  taken over 
many years.

3.7 Drivers of Knowledge 
Different  aspects  of  the  mission  such  as  crew  size,  experience,  excursion  time, 
exploration  time,  mobility,    range,  and  instrumentation  affect  knowledge.    All  of  these 
with  the  exception  of  instrumentation  will  be  modeled.    The  reason  instrumentation  is 
not  modeled  here  is  that  it  varies  by  mission  depending  on  the  specific  science 
objectives  of  that  mission.    For  example,  a  mission  focused  on  geology  will  have  very 
different  instruments  than  a mission  focused  on  climatology.    Instrumentation  is  further 
discussed  in Appendix  9.5.   During  the  later Apollo missions  approximately  one  third  of 
the  total  time spent on  the Moon surface was spent during an excursion  (Table 2).   The 
earlier  Apollo  missions  did  not  have  as  high  of  an  excursion  time  for  two  possible 
reasons.    The  first  is  the  lack  of  experience.    Later  Apollo  missions  were  able  to  gain 
experience  with  surface  operations  on  both  the  Earth  and  Moon  from  the  first  Apollo 
mission.  The other reason is because the first few Apollo missions did not have science 
as  their  primary  mission  objective.    Only  Apollo  15-17  had  “extensive  scientific 
investigation”  of  Moon  as  a  primary  mission  purpose  whereas  Apollo  11’s  primary 
mission  was  a  manned  lunar  landing  demonstration  (NASA  website,  2004).    The 
primary  mission  for  Apollo  12-14  was  precision  piloted  landing  and  systematic  lunar 
exploration.    Thus,  experience  had  an  effect  on  the  excursion  time  for  lunar  missions, 
and had a maximum of 30% of the total lunar stay time for a mission.

Each excursion had a predetermined plan, however there were times when independent 
exploration was allowed and carried out by  the astronauts.   An example of  independent 
exploration  results  was  the  orange  pyroclastic  glass  discovered  in  Shorty  Crater  by 
Apollo  17.    This  exploration  was  not  dictated  by  ground.    When  the  astronauts  were 
exploring  in  the  area,  they  had  30  minutes  of  rapid  assessment  and  gathering  before 
the mission controllers were even aware of  the events.    Independent exploration allows 
a  human  to  fully  utilize  his/her  training,  experience  and  senses  to  return  knowledge, 
either as samples, pictures, observations, technology used, or operational procedures. 
Using  the  number  of  crew,  excursion  time,  exploration  time,  and mobility,  the  coverage 
area  during  exploration  can  be  determined.    Assuming  an  experienced  crew,  the 
excursion time can be maximized as 30% of the mission surface time, which is similar to 
the Apollo missions.  Exploration is defined by examining the surrounding area within 10 
meters of  the astronaut, since  this  is  the  range  for which  the human eye has an optimal 
ability 
to  determine  unique  aspects  of 
the  surroundings 
(Schmitt,  personal 
communications).    It  is  assumed  that  some  portion  of  an  excursion  is  spent  performing 
this  exploration  process.    For  this  knowledge  model,  30%  of  the  excursion  time  was 
spent  as  this  independent  exploration  time.    This  could  vary  a  great  deal  on  an 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      47              

 

excursion  by  excursion  basis,  but 
it  was  approximated  based  on  personal 
communications  with  Jack  Schmitt.    There  are  three  types  of  mobility,  a  walking  pace 
(or gait) while traversing without exploring, a slower exploration pace, and a rover speed.  
The walking  pace  is  based  on  the  design  speed  of  an Apollo  astronaut  and  determines 
the  maximum  traveling  distance  per  day  from  the  starting  point,  presumably  a  lunar 
module  .   The exploration pace  is estimated as  four  times slower  than  the gait because 
the  human 
is  more  carefully  analyzing 
the  environment  and  perhaps 
taking 
measurements  or  pictures  (NASA  Headquarters  website,  2004).    The  rover  pace  is 
based  on  the  Apollo  Lunar  Rover  (Apollomaniacs,  2004)  and  is  capable  of  expanding 
the maximum traveling distance per day.  These parameters are summarized  in Table 3 
and are used to determine how much coverage per day can be accomplished. 
 
Coverage  is  defined  as  the  area  traversed  at  an  exploration  pace  and  can  be  used  to 
quantify  how much  knowledge  potential  is  gained.   As more  area  is  explored,  a  greater 
amount  of  knowledge  is  potentially  gained,  either  from  science  or  resource  data,  or 
technical  and  operational  procedures.    Since  exploration  pace  is  slower  than  the 
maximum  speed  by  astronauts,  either  by  rover  or  by walking,  there  is  a  certain  amount 
of  coverage  than  can  be  achieved  per  day.    The  number  of  crew  available  will  directly 
affect  this  coverage,  which  is  shown  in  Figure  18.    There  is  a  clear  direct  relationship 
between  the  number  of  crew  and  the  maximum  exploration  coverage  achievable  per 
day.    The  coverage  achieved  while  walking  can  either  be  completed  by  increasing  the 
number  of  days  on  the  surface,  or  by  increasing  the  number  of  crew.    If  walking  is  the 
fastest  mode  of  transportation,  100%  coverage  can  be  achieved  rather  easily,  after 
which the knowledge potential is maximized in that particular landing site.  Using a rover 
increases mobility,  and  in  this  case,  the maximum  area  that may  be  traversed  in  a  day 
dramatically  increases,  decreasing  the  percent  area  covered  per  day.    To  increase  the 
exploration  coverage  requires  either  a  longer  stay  than  the  non-rover  case  or  a  larger 
crew.

This  model  can  also  incorporate  faster  speed  rovers.    Introduction  of  a  pressurized 
rover  that  allows  astronauts  to  stay  outside  of  the  base  can  further  expand  knowledge 
potential  as  seen  in  Figure  19.    By  creating  a  remote  base,  travel  can  be  further 
expanded  from  the  remote  location,  thus  expanding  the  knowledge  potential  from 
exploration.

Another possible method of  increasing knowledge potential  is to  increase the amount of 
independent  exploration  time  per  excursion.    In  fact,  as  missions  proceed,  a  greater 
amount  of  independent  and  flexible  time  for  the  astronauts  should  be  encouraged, 
especially  as  communication  delays  increase  for  farther  missions  (Schmitt,  personal 
communication).    In  conclusion,  the  knowledge  potential  of  a mission  can  be  predicted

by  the  exploration  coverage,  which  is  affected  by  the  number  of  crew,  experience, 
excursion time, exploration time, and mobility. 

3.8  Knowledge Drivers: Apollo Case Study  
The  Apollo  missions  offer  a  good  case  study  for  how  knowledge  return  is  affected  by 
knowledge  drivers.    In  this  case,  knowledge  returned  is  quantified  by  the  mass  of 
samples  returned  from  the  Moon.    If  Moon  rocks  are  carefully  chosen,  increasing 
amounts of samples gathered should  return  increasing amounts of knowledge  (to a  first 
order), most  likely  scientific  or  resource  related.  The  amount  of  knowledge  can  also  be 
driven  by  the  exploration  time  and  the  distance  traveled.    Figure  20  illustrates  the 
returned mass  as  a  function  of  the maximum  distance  from  the  Lunar Module  and  as  a 
function of the time spent outside of the Lunar Module (data from NASA website, 2004).  
Clearly  there  is  a  direct  relationship,  however  there  are  other  inherent  drivers  that  are 
not  as  easily  captured.    They  are  human  experience,  timing,  and  new  technology.  
Apollo  11  lacked  experience  and  thus  had  a  limited  exploration  time  and  did  not 
traverse much distance, as shown by  the point closest  to  the origin  in each plot.   As  the 
missions  progressed  in  time,  experience  increased,  resulting  in  longer  and  further 
exploration.    Each  of  the  graphs  illustrate  a  large  jump  in  the  mass  of  samples,  and 
therefore  the  knowledge,  returned,  coinciding  with  Apollo  14  to  Apollo  15  because 
Apollo  15  was  the  first  mission  to  include  a  rover.    Figure  21  illustrates  a  graph  of  the 
cost  of  the  knowledge  returned  and  the  table  showing  the  percent  increase  of  cost  and 
mass returned of one Apollo mission relative to the previous.  It  is  important to note that 
the cost shown here does not  include development costs.   The  largest percent  increase 
in  knowledge  coincides  with  the  largest  percent  increase  in  cost,  which  occurred  in 
Apollo  15  because  of  the  introduction  of  the  rover.    This  is  a  clear  example  of  how 
infusing  new  technology  into  an  existing  architecture  can  result  in  an  increase  of 
knowledge  returned.    Apollo  16  and  17  continued  using  the  rover  and  experienced  a 
much higher sample return than the non-rover missions.  With added human experience 
from previous rover-enable missions, they were also able to traverse further and explore 
for longer periods of time.

3.9  Knowledge Summary 
The  design  of  a  sustainable  space  infrastructure  will  use  knowledge  as  the  deliverable 
as  a  metric  for  its  design.    The  next  sections  will  discuss  how  different  missions  gain 
various  types  and  levels  of  knowledge.    Knowledge  will  affect  mission  characteristics 
such as  landing  locations, surface mobility, and mission  lifetime.   The knowledge model 
developed  in  this  section  was  not  directly  used  in  the mass  transportation  architecture, 
but  it  would  be  beneficial  for  future  research  to  incorporate  the  knowledge  drivers  into 
the mass architecture in a more integrated fashion.

4.  Baseline Mission Designs 

 

Having  identified  knowledge  as  the  key  value-added  deliverable,  and  examined  how 
kind  and  quality  of  knowledge  vary  with  mission  profile  and  technology,  the  problem 
remains how to integrate this understanding into a space system conceptual design that 
takes  into  account  sustainability.  This  chapter  describes  the  first  step  in  the  process 
described  in  chapter  two  to  create  sustainable  exploration  systems:  designing  staged 
missions  to  the  Moon  and  Mars.  Staged  missions  are  defined  as  Short,  Medium,  and 
Extended  Stay,  and  were  designed  with  the  goal  of  maximizing  commonality  through 
each  stage.  Later  steps  in  the  design  process,  described  in  chapters  five  and  six,  help 
determine functional and formal commonality across Moon and Mars missions. 
 
It  is  important to note that once commonality across Moon and Mars missions has been 
identified  and  exploited  through  changing  mission  forms  and  operations,  the  individual 
staged  Moon  and  Mars  mission  must  be  revisited  and  altered  according  to  new 
capabilities  and  requirements.  Steps  one  through  three  of  the  design  process  are  thus 
iterative.  This  chapter  represents  the  culmination  of  one  iteration  of  this  process,  and 
thus  presents  considerable  formal  and  operational  commonality  between  staged  Moon 
and staged Mars missions. For  this  reason,  it begins with a discussion of  the  forms  that 
will be used for both the Moon and Mars staged missions. 

4.1 Brief Description of Formal Elements 
The  Crew  Operations  Vehicle  (COV)  is  functionally  similar  to  the  Apollo  Command 
Module,  capable  of  transporting  a  crew  of  three  and  supporting  the  crew  for  a  short 
duration mission. The Habitation Module  (HM)  is an extensible habitable  volume, made 
up  of  multiple  modular  sections.    The  Habitation  Module  can  sustain  life  for  long 
duration missions.   When COV  and HM modules  dock,  they  form  the  Crew Exploration 
System  (CES).    The  Service  Module  (SM)  is  capable  of  providing  propulsion  for 
transiting  the crew  from Earth  to destination or destination  to Earth.   Service Module #1 
is  the engine  for  the  trip  to  the destination while Service Module #2  is  the engine  for  the 
return  trip.    In  combination  with  the  COV  and  HM,  this  module  is  defined  as  the 
Moon/Mars Transfer Vehicle  (MTV).   The Mars Landers  (ML) or  the Lunar Landers  (LL) 
are  functionally  similar  to  the  Apollo  type  Lander,  although  have  slightly  different  forms 
for Moon and Mars missions, and capable of transporting three crewmembers from orbit 
to the surface and back into orbit.  Capable of providing accommodations for three crew 
members for launch into LEO and descent back to Earth, the Modern Command Module 
(MCM)  is  functionally  similar  to  the  COV.    Two  MCMs  are  needed  for  missions  with 
crew sizes of six.  These modules are summarized in Table 4.

4.2 Moon 

4.2.1 Introduction 
 The  lunar  baseline  mission  includes  Short,  Medium,  and  Extended  missions.  The 
objective  of  Short  Stay  Lunar Missions  (SSLM)  is  to  demonstrate  the  basic  technology 
for  lunar  missions.    The  SSLM  is  equivalent  to  the  first  “return  to  the  Moon”  mission 
described 
in  President  Bush’s  New  Vision 
for  Space  Exploration  Program.  
Approximately  two SSLMs are suggested, with a  frequency of  two per year, as dictated 
by  Earth  launch  considerations  aimed  at  maximizing  launch  cost  efficiency.    Refer  to 
Section 6.4.2 for more information about launch considerations. 
 
The  objectives  of  the  Medium  Stay  Lunar  Missions  (MSLM)  are  to  acquire  scientific 
knowledge  and  assess  the  value  of  potential  locations  for  Extended  Stay  Lunar 
Missions (ESLM). Approximately five MSLMs are suggested with at least one landing on 
the far side of the Moon or a lunar pole. A frequency of two MSLMs a year is suggested 
based  on  Earth  launch  considerations.    The  MSLM  is  based  on  the  “stepping  stone” 
approach mentioned  in  President  Bush’s New  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  Program  to 
steadily  increase  our  mission  complexity  while  expanding  our  reach  out  into  the  solar 
system.  
 
Finally,  the Extended Stay Lunar Missions  (ESLM) will  involve a six-month surface stay 
and will  include  a  semi-permanent  base.    This  is  a  continuation  of  this  “stepping  stone” 
approach.    These  missions  are  to  serve  as  a  testbed  for  future  Mars  missions  and 
provide  a  platform  for  long-term  lunar-based  science  investigations.  Approximately  two 
ESLMs are suggested on the far side of the Moon and/or a lunar pole to carried out at a 
frequency of approximately 1.5 missions per year.

Although  the  baseline  mission  architectures  presented  in  this  paper  are  not  optimized, 
previous  lunar  mission  architecture  studies  were  reviewed  to  inform  architectural 
decisions for the lunar baseline mission presented in Section 4.2.4. 
 
Houbolt  (1961)  extensively  studies  many  combinations  of  mission  architectures, 
concluding  that  Lunar  Orbit  Rendezvous  (LOR)  is  the  fastest  and  most  reliable 
architecture. Houbolt also  shows  that  this method of going  to  the Moon greatly  reduces 
the amount of mass required  to be  launched  from Earth.   Houbolt outlines requirements 
for  power,  instrumentation,  life  support,  and  navigation,  as  well  as  launch  masses  for 
different mission architectures.   These  include a direct  to  the Moon concept, Earth orbit 
rendezvous,  and  the  use  of  different  fuels  and  launch  vehicles.    He  considers  small, 
medium, and large landers, and also suggests the possibility of using two small landers, 
because  “this  combination  has  a  rescue  capability  not  possessed  by  direct  or  other 
forms  of  lunar  landing  missions”  (Houbolt,  1961,  p.13).    Trade-off  studies  and 
calculations  include  trajectory  options,  errors  in  guidance,  abort  options  at  different 
stages of  the mission, possible  fuels,  size  of  landers and  return  vehicles, and  the mass 
required  in  Earth  and  lunar  orbit  for  several  architecture  options.  Notably,  Houbolt’s 
report  includes  sections on  safety and  reliability, development program  scheduling, and 
facility needs. 
 
Eckart  (1999)  qualitatively  describes  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  six  lunar 
mission  architectures.  The  first  architecture,  a  Direct  One-Way  Mission,  is  particularly 
beneficial  for  cargo  missions  with  expendable  transfer  and  landing  stages.  A  slight 
variation of  this mission,  the One Way Mission with Lunar Orbit Staging  is beneficial  for 
both  cargo  missions  and  crewed  missions,  assuming  a  return  vehicle  for  the  crew  is 
positioned  on  the  lunar  surface.  The  third  architecture,  an Apollo-type Mission  is  useful 
for  architectures  involving  crew  exchange  and  re-supply  from  one  vehicle  to  another. 
One variant of the Apollo-type Missions uses the Earth-Moon L1 (EM-L1) or EM-L2 as a 
staging point rather than lunar orbit; however, Eckart posited that this architecture yields 
lower  performance  and  longer  transit  times  than  the  Apollo-type  Missions.  The  fifth 
architecture  described  uses  a  Lunar  Transfer  Vehicle  (LTV)  and  a  Lunar  Excursion 
Vehicle  (LEV).  In  this  case,  the  LTV  transfers  the  crew  from  and  Earth  orbit  space 
station  to  a  lunar  parking  orbit.  The  LEV  transfers  the  crew  from  lunar  orbit  to  lunar 
surface  and  back  to  lunar  orbit.  The  LTV  then  returns  the  crew  from  lunar  orbit  back  to 
the  Earth  orbit  space  station.  This  mission  utilizes  reusable  stages  and  LEO 
infrastructure,  and  restricts  trans-lunar  and  trans-Earth  injection  opportunities.  Finally, 
the last architecture is a variation of the LTV/LEV architecture using EM-L1 or EM-L2 as 
a staging point rather  than  lunar orbit. Eckart asserts  that use of either of  these  libration 
points lowers performance and increases transit time.  
 
Condon  and Wilson  (2004)  describe  mission  architectures  similar  to  those  put  forth  by 
Eckart  in  quantitative  detail.  Condon  and  Wilson  analyze  ten  different  mission  profiles 
grouped  into  three  architecture  types:  lunar  surface  rendezvous  (LSR),  lunar  orbit 
rendezvous  (LOR),  and  libration  point  rendezvous  (LPR).  They  compare  the  mission 
profiles  in  terms  of  ∆V  with  the  constraint  that  the  crew  should  not  be  required  to  wait 
longer than three times the period of the lunar phasing and rendezvous orbit to initiate a 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      55              

 

lunar  departure.  Condon  and  Wilson  conclude  that  for  a  sustained,  ambitious  program 
of lunar exploration requiring global access to the lunar surface, a stay time greater than 
twenty-eight  days,  and  a  capability  to  abort  at  any  time,  LPR  costs  less  ∆V  than  LOR 
missions.  However,  LSR  missions  require  the  lowest  overall  ∆V,  because  they  do  not 
require plane changes in lunar proximity or the additional ∆V associated with a stopover 
in EM-L1. 
 
Joosent  (2001)  analyzes  different  space  system  architectures 
in 
the  Earth’s 
Neighborhood, defined as its gravitational sphere of influence with a radius of 1.5 million 
km. Joosent specifically discusses the benefits of using the EM-L1 point as staging area 
for reaching high latitude lunar landing sites.  The author also explores different physical 
architecture designs and elements, using current space transportation and infrastructure 
elements  (in  particular  the  Space  Shuttle  and  the  International  Space  Station).    For 
instance,  he  analyzes  the  advantages  of  using  the  ISS  as  a  LEO  staging  facility,  to 
decouple  in  time  that  the  complex  launch  choreography  that  a  long  stay Moon mission 
will  require.    Joosent  suggests  that  a  single  “gateway”  located  in  the  EM-L1,  will 
centralize  all  human  deep  space  operations  by  providing  accessibility  to  the Moon,  the 
Earth-Sun  Lagrange  points,  and  to  Mars  transfer  orbits.  He  mentions  that  an  “Omega” 
Space Station at the EM-L1 is a likely complement of the “Alpha” ISS already in place.   
 
Engineers  since  before  Apollo  have  theorized  and  analyzed  different  architectural 
possibilities  for  human  Moon  missions.      Houbolt  did  not  consider  pre-positioning, 
because  propulsion  technologies  such  as  electric  propulsion  were  not  feasible  at  that 
time.   Current authors have  the option of using existing  infrastructure not available prior 
to  Apollo  as  well  as  advancements 
in 
launch 
technologies,  navigation  and 
communication  tools,  and  other  technologies.    As  the  nation’s  space  program  has 
matured,  the  technologies  available  to  space  architects  have  increased  substantially.  
The number of combinations of possible elements has  increased to thousands, and has 
made  the  process  of  architecture  selection  a  question  of  rigorous mathematics,  as well 
as  space  mission  “common  sense.”    This  literature  review  summarizes  necessary 
considerations  for  choosing  a  lunar  baseline  mission  architecture  and  relevant  trade 
studies. 
 

4.2.3 Requirements and Assumptions 
The  requirements  for  the  Moon  missions  are  threefold.    First,  these  missions  must 
demonstrate the capability to transport humans safely from the Earth  to the Moon.  This 
includes  launch,  transfer,  rendezvous,  and  landing.  Second,  these  missions  must 
demonstrate  the  capability  to  support  humans  in  terms  of  life  support,  communication, 
and in-space and ground operations.  Third, these missions must serve as a technology 
testbed for future Mars Missions and expand our knowledge of the Moon.  
 
The purpose of the Short Stay Lunar Mission  is to demonstrate the mission capability of 
going  to  the  Moon.    The  purpose  of  the  medium  stay  lunar  mission  is  acquisition  of 
scientific  data  and  knowledge,  and  the  purpose  of  the  Extended  Stay  Lunar  Mission  is 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      56              

 

to  demonstrate  technologies  for  a  mission  to  Mars  including  long  duration  habitation 
technologies. 
 
In  addition,  it  should  be  mentioned  that  a  crew  size  of  three  is  used  on  the  Short  and 
Medium missions to the Moon.  This crew size was chosen because it is a smaller scale 
than  the Mars missions, which  involve  crews  of  six.    The  rationale  for  using  crew  sizes 
of six  is discussed  later  in Section 4.3.2.1.   The Extended+  lunar mission has a crew of 
six to gain experience with such a large crew size in preparation for missions to Mars. 
 
The baseline mission assumptions include: 
-  Pre-positioned  modules  will  transit  to  the  staging  location  using  electric 
propulsion. 
-  Manned mission segments will use cryogenic chemical propulsion. 
-  Technology  will  be  developed  to  store  cryogenic  chemical  fuel  for  long 
durations without significant boil off. 
-  Radiation  and  low-gravity  countermeasures  will  be  developed  by  the  time 
Extended Stay Lunar Missions are performed. 
-  Advanced  EVA  spacesuits  are  developed  for  medium  and  long  duration 
missions. 
-  The ability to land humans and cargo on the far side of the Moon is developed 
in time for medium stay lunar missions. 
-  The  ability  to  separately  land  humans  and  cargo  within  walking  distance  on 
the  lunar surface will be developed prior to the Extended Stay Lunar Missions.

Figure 22: Operational view of Short Stay Lunar Mission 

 
Short Stay Lunar Missions have a crew of  three astronauts and  two of  these astronauts 
spend approximately two days on the lunar surface. 
 
A  Crew  Operations  Vehicle  (COV)  containing  three  astronauts  is  launched  into  low 
Earth  orbit  on  a  man-rated  launch  vehicle  such  as  a  man-rated  heavy  EELV.  A  Lunar 
Lander  (LL)  is  launched  into  LEO  separately  using  an  STS-derived  launch  vehicle. 
Launch  vehicles  are  chosen  based  on  mass  estimates  documented  in  Appendix  9.3.  
The  COV  and  LL  dock  in  LEO  and  transit  to  lunar  orbit  together  using  cryogenic 
chemical  propellant.  Once  in  lunar  orbit,  two  crewmembers  transfer  to  the  LL,  undock 
from  the  COV  and  descend  to  an  equatorial  landing  site  on  the  near  side  of  the  Moon 
using  cryogenic  chemical  propellant.  One  crewmember  remains  in  the  COV  in  lunar 
orbit.  
 
The  astronauts  on  the  lunar  surface  will  live  in  the  LL  for  approximately  two  days  and 
explore  the  landing  site  on  foot;  EVA  will  have  minimal  science  capabilities  since  the 
purpose of this mission is to be a basic technology demonstration.

      58              

 

Upon  the conclusion of  the surface stay,  the  two astronauts ascend  to  lunar orbit  in  the 
LL using cryogenic chemical propellant and dock with the COV. One person is left in the 
COV as a safety measure for the basic technology demonstration; in case the LL fails to 
dock with  the COV,  the  astronaut  in  the COV  can manually maneuver  to  dock with  the 
LL. Then,  the astronauts  transfer  to  the COV, undock with  the LL, and  initiate  the return 
trip  using  cryogenic  chemical  propellant.  The  COV  performs  a  ballistic  re-entry, 
returning the astronauts to Earth.  

4.2.4.2 Medium Stay Mission 

 

Figure 23: Operational view of Medium Stay Lunar Mission 

 
 
 
Medium  Stay  Lunar  Missions  have  a  crew  of  three  astronauts  and  use  the  same 
spacecraft  forms  as  the  Short  Stay  Lunar  Missions.  However,  there  are  three 
differences  between  the  Short  and  Medium  Stay  Missions:  the  LL  is  pre-positioned  in 
lunar  orbit  using  electric  propulsion,  all  astronauts  transfer  to  the  LL  to  descend  to  the 
lunar surface, and the astronauts stay on the lunar surface for one week. 
 
The  justification  for  pre-positioning  the  Lunar  Lander  in  lunar  orbit  before  the  arrival  of 
the  crew  is  to  test  the  technology  of  pre-positioning  essential  mission  cargo  utilizing 
electric  propulsion  technology.   While  not  providing  a major mass  savings  for missions 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      59              

 

to  the  Moon,  the  capability  of  pre-positioning  will  allow  for  dramatic  mass  savings  for 
missions to Mars.  This is one of the ways the Moon can be used as a testbed for future 
missions to Mars. 
 
First,  a  LL  is  launched  into  LEO  alone  using  an  STS-derived  launch  vehicle.  Electric 
propulsion  is then used to pre-position the LL  in  lunar orbit. Later, a COV containing the 
three  astronauts  is  launched  into  low  Earth  orbit  using  an  EELV  (Delta  IV  Heavy).  The 
COV  transits  to  lunar  orbit  together  using  cryogenic  chemical  propellant. Once  in  lunar 
orbit, the COV docks with the pre-positioned LL, the three crew members transfer to the 
LL, undock  from  the COV and descend  to non-equatorial  landing sites on  the near side 
of  the Moon  using  cryogenic  chemical  propellant. No  crewmembers  remain  in  the COV 
in  lunar  orbit;  it  is  assumed  LL  ascent  was  proven  to  be  reliable  during  the  Short  Stay 
Lunar Missions.   
 
The  astronauts  on  the  lunar  surface  will  live  in  the  LL  for  approximately  one  week  and 
explore  the  landing  site using an  “open-air”  rover  to aid mobility within walking distance 
from  the  LL;  EVA  will  have  high  science  capabilities  including  research  in  some  of  the 
areas outlined in Section 3.2.1: Scientific Knowledge.  
 
Upon  the  conclusion  of  the  surface  stay,  the  three  astronauts  ascend  to  lunar  orbit  in 
the  LL  using  cryogenic  chemical  propellant  and  dock  with  the  COV.  The  astronauts 
transfer  the  COV,  undock  from  the  LL,  and  initiate  the  return  trip  using  cryogenic 
chemical  propellant.  The  COV  performs  a  ballistic  re-entry,  returning  the  astronauts  to 
Earth.

Figure 24: Operational view of Extended Stay Lunar Mission 

 
Extended  Stay  Lunar  Missions  have  a  crew  of  six  astronauts  and  require  a  pre-
positioned  surface  habitat  for  the  crew  to  live  in  for  up  to  six  months.    A  crew  of  six  is 
used for this mission since future missions to Mars will have crew sizes of six. 
 
It  is  important  to  mention  that  the  increased  complexity  of  the  Extended  Stay  Lunar 
mission  is essential  for  two major  reasons.   First,  the  increased  complexity  results  from 
the multitude of  technologies being  tested  in preparation  for missions  to Mars.   Second, 
the  increased  complexity  is  used  to  return  even  greater  amounts  of  knowledge  back  to 
Earth.   This  is made possible  from a  crew  living on  the Moon  for an extended period of 
time in a location that is highly valuable from a knowledge point of view. 
 
First, a surface habitation module  (SHM)  is  launched  into LEO possibly using  two STS-
derived  launch  vehicles.  The  SHM  is  then  pre-positioned  on  the  lunar  surface,  using 
electric  propulsion  for  the  transit  to  lunar  orbit,  and  cryogenic  chemical  propulsion  for 
the  descent. Second,  two  Lunar  Landers  are  launched  into  LEO  separately  using STS-
derived  launch  vehicles.  Electric  propulsion  is  then  used  to  pre-position  the  Lunar 
Landers  in  lunar orbit. One module of  the habitation module  (HM)  is  launched  into LEO 
along  with  one  of  the  Lunar  Landers.  Third,  a  COV  containing  three  astronauts  is 
launched  into  LEO  using  a man-rated  launch  vehicle  such  as  a man-rated  EELV.    The 
same  launch vehicle also contains a Modern Command Module  (MCM).   Each of  these 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      61              

 

vehicles contains three astronauts.  The COV docks with the HM and MCM, the crew of 
the MCM transfers to the HM, and the MCM undocks. 
 
The docked COV and HM then transit to lunar orbit using cryogenic chemical propellant. 
In  lunar  orbit,  the  pre-positioned  LL1  docks  with  the  COV  and  HM,  the  three 
crewmembers  transfer  to  the  LL1,  the  LL1  undocks  from  the COV  and  descends  to  the 
pre-positioned  SHM  on  the  far  side  or  pole  of  the  Moon  using  cryogenic  chemical 
propellant.  Likewise,  the  second  pre-positioned  Lander,  LL2  then  docks  with  the  COV 
and  HM  and  transfers  the  crew  to  the  SHM.  No  crewmembers  remain  in  the  COV  in 
lunar orbit. 
 
The astronauts on  the  lunar surface will  transfer  from  the Lunar Landers  to  the SHM  for 
a  surface  stay  of  approximately  six  months.  The  semi-permanent  base  allows  for 
extensive  science  capabilities,  possibly  including  but  not  limited  to  Moon-based 
observatories,  greenhouse  technology  demonstrations  for  closed-loop  life  support,  and 
nuclear power production. A habitable, pressurized  rover  for overnight  field  trips will aid 
surface mobility.  
 
At  the  end  of  the  surface  stay  the  six  astronauts  ascend  to  lunar  orbit  in  the  two  Lunar 
Landers.    Each  Lander  individually  docks  with  the  COV  and  HM.  After  each  docking, 
three  astronauts  transfer  to  the  COV  and  then  the  COV  and  Landers  undock.    Finally, 
the  astronauts  initiate  the  return  trip  to  Earth  in  the  COV  using  cryogenic  chemical 
propellant.  The  COV  and  HM  use  aerobraking  to  establish  Earth  orbit  and  then  dock 
with  the MCM. Three astronauts  transfer  to  the MCM  to return  to Earth. The other  three 
astronauts remain in the COV, undock from the HM, and return to Earth. 

4.2.5 Commonality within Moon Missions 
The  lunar baseline missions were designed with a stepping-stone approach; complexity 
is added  to missions  in  stages. For example,  the SSLM  requires one COV and one LL. 
While  the  MSLM  requires  the  same  forms  as  the  SSLM,  complexity  is  added  in  two 
ways:  first,  the  LL  is  pre-positioned.    Second  the  LL  remains  unmanned  in  lunar  orbit. 
The ESLM  requires another  increase  in complexity  to prepare  for  future Mars missions. 
For  these missions,  three astronauts  travel  to LEO  in  the COV as  in previous missions, 
however  three  other  astronauts  travel  into  LEO  in  a  new  form,  the MCM.  The  transit  to 
the  Moon  is  carried  out  with  the  COV  and  another  new  form,  the  HM.  Finally,  for  this 
mission, two LL are pre-positioned rather than one.  

4.2.6 Discussion of Lunar Baseline Missions 

4.2.6.1 Technologies to be Demonstrated for Future Mars Missions 
This  section  describes  Mars  technology  demonstrations  carried  out  on  Extended  Stay 
Lunar  Missions.  The  short  and  medium  stay  missions  are  not  intended  for  technology 
demonstration,  although  by  necessity  certain  technologies  will  be  demonstrated  on 
these missions.   

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      62              

4.2.6.1.1 Surface Operations 

 

Lunar Lander (LL) 
The  Lander  technologies  that  must  be  demonstrated  on  the  Moon  for  the  future  Mars 
missions are: 
 

•  Slow  descent  engines.    The  Mars  mission  will  initially  use  aerobraking 
and  a  parachute  to  decelerate  to  the  surface.    Once  near  the  surface, 
descent  engines  are  used  to  touch  down;  descent  engines  will  be 
demonstrated on the Moon. 
•  Ascent stages.  The Mars Lander will use a staged ascent, and the Lunar 
Lander will not; nevertheless,  the “launch pad”  technology used  for ascent 
is similar for both Moon and Mars missions. 
•  Reduced  gravity.    The  gravity  constraints  are  different  for  the  two 
planets;  the Moon has 1/6-G and Mars has 3/8-G.   The Moon will be used 
to  demonstrate  reduced  gravity  landings,  but  due  to  the  gravity  disparity, 
the Moon can only serve as a partial testbed.  
•  Life support.  Both Landers will use the same life support systems. 
•  Ability  to  land unmanned. For rescue capabilities, an unmanned orbiting 
Lander  should  be  able  to  land,  unmanned,  and  rescue  crewmembers  on 
the  lunar  or  Martian  surface.  This  is  not  a  direct  requirement  for  the 
Martian  missions,  but  may  be  used  in  future  Mars  missions.    The 
capability  is deemed  important enough  for  the  lunar missions alone,  that  it 
will  be  demonstrated  for Mars,  even  if  the  unmanned  Lander  is  ultimately 
not used for the Mars missions.    

Surface Habitat Module (SHM) 
The  SHM  technologies  to  be  demonstrated  on  the  Moon  for  the  future  Mars  missions 
are: 
 

•  Life  support.    The  technology  for  extended  life  support  necessary  for  Mars 
surface operations will be demonstrated with a lunar surface habitat. 
•  Pre-positioning.    The  surface  habitats  will  be  pre-positioned  on  the  lunar  and 
Martian  surfaces.    They  will  need  to  achieve  high  accuracy  in  landing  location 
and be able to land in a specified orientation.  
•  Surface  manipulation,  docking.    If  more  than  one  surface  habitat  module  is 
used,  crewmembers  will  need  to  be  able  to  connect  the  pre-positioned  surface 
modules together once they reach the surface. 
•  Communications.  The 
lunar  communication  network  will  use  Ka-band 
communication  and  is  mostly  extensible  to  a  Martian  communication  network. 
The  primary  difference  between  the  two  networks  is  the  size  of  the  antenna 
placed on the Moon and on Mars. The lunar communication network may also be 
used  as  a  backup  communication  infrastructure  for Mars missions  in  the  event  a 
Mars-Earth link is severed.

Rovers  
A pressurized version of  the  rover will be used  for Extended Stay missions  to  the Moon 
as  well  as  Extended  and  Extended+ Mars missions.    The  rover  technologies  that must 
be demonstrated on the Moon for future Mars missions are: 
 
 
•  Range.  The rover will have a round trip traveling distance capability of up to 500 
km,  as  there  is  no  constraint  requiring  that  the  astronauts  be  capable  of walking 
back  to  the  Surface  Habitat.    A  round  trip  traveling  distance  of  500  km  was 
determined  by  assuming  a  400  hour  sortie  driving  at  a  speed  of  10  km/hr  for 
three hours per day. 
•  Habitability.    The  rover  that  will  be  demonstrated  on  the  Moon  for  Mars  is  a 
“habitable  rover.”    It  will  have  the  capability  of  sustaining  humans  for  up  to  400 
hours  on  a  geologic  traverse.    The  interior  of  the  rover  is  a  “shirtsleeve 
environment:”  geologist-astronauts  will  be  able  to  work  outside  the  rover  during 
the day and sleep in the rover without wearing their spacesuits at night. 
•  Science  capabilities.  The purpose of the extended geologic traverses will be to 
do  field work.    It  is necessary  that  the  rovers have basic  tools  to extract samples 
from  the  surface;  however,  analysis  will  be  done  in  the  SHM  and  upon  return  to 
Earth.   

Other technology demonstrations: 
•  Spacesuits.    It  is  highly  desirable  to  develop  a  spacesuit  that  allows  for 
increased mobility and locomotion to decrease the human energy output required 
for  performing  surface  EVA  tasks.  This  increases  the  ability  of  crewmembers  to 
perform  scientific  analysis  of  the  surface.  This  new  spacesuit  should  have  a 
longer  useful  life  than  the  Apollo  suit  and  should  use  advanced  techniques  in 
materials,  gas  pressure  versus  mechanical  counter-pressure,  etc.    In  order  to 
increase  useful  life,  the  suit  needs  to  address  the  problem  of  dust  faced  during 
Apollo.    This  problem  with  dust  is  also  a  problem  for  bringing  the  spacesuits  in 
and out of the SHM; it may be necessary to devise a cleaning system for both the 
exterior and the interior of the suit. Small parts of the suit may be changed out for 
the  different  planets,  but  as  much  as  possible  the  suit  should  be  tested  on  the 
Moon for Mars, and capable of operations on both planets. 
•  Tools.  All missions will require simple tools for sample collection.  Missions may 
include  robotic  “helpers”  for  sample  collection  that  may  or  may  not  interact  with 
the  crew.    For  extended missions  on  the Moon  and Mars,  resource  extraction  is 
desirable,  and  the missions may  require  industrial-like machinery  that  should  be 
demonstrated on the Moon before being used on Mars. 
•  Closed-loop  life  support.    Before  an  extended Mars mission  is  launched  using 
closed-loop  life  support,  it  is  necessary  to  demonstrate  such  capabilities  on  the 
Moon.    These  capabilities  include  the  use  of  greenhouses,  resource  extraction, 
the manufacture of breathable air, and other capabilities.   While  the  resources at 
the  two  destinations  are  clearly  different,  the  capability  of  sustaining  human  life 
without external support should be demonstrated.

•  Aerobraking.    The  lunar mission will demonstrate  the  technology of aerobraking 
into  Earth’s  atmosphere.    The  modules  that  will  aerobrake  for  the  lunar  mission 
are the COV and one HM module docked together. 

4.2.6.1.2 Other Operations 

Pre-positioning  
Successful pre-positioning must be accomplished during lunar missions before a  
Mars mission is performed. 
 
The components that must be pre-positioned in LEO are: 
•  Habitation Module (HM) 
•  Modern Command Module 1 (MCM1) 
The components that must be pre-positioned in lunar or Martian orbit are: 
•  Landers (LL1 and/or LL2) 
The component that must be pre-positioned on the lunar or Martian surface is: 
•  Surface Habitation Module (SHM – one or more) 

Docking  
Successful  docking  must  be  accomplished  during  lunar  missions  before  a  mission  to 
Mars.  Components that must dock for both lunar and martial missions are: 
•  HM and COV 
•  HM/COV and MCM1 
•  COV/HM and LL1, COV/HM and LL2 
These  components  will  need  to  be  designed  considering  the  requirements  needed  for 
docking  in orbit.   Maneuvering propulsion systems as well as guidance, navigation, and 
control  capabilities  may  be  required  on  board  these  modules  to  facilitate  on-orbit 
docking. 

Unmanned Orbiter 
Both  the  lunar  and Martian missions will  involve  an  unmanned  orbiting  craft  around  the 
destination.   For  example,  in  the Extended  lunar mission,  the  docked HM  and COV will 
dock with  the Lunar Lander,  to  transfer  the  crew,  then  the HM an COV must be able  to 
orbit,  unmanned,  for  six  months  or  longer  before  the  crew  ascends  and  docks  to 
transfer  for  the  return  trip.    The  capabilities  of  orbiting  unmanned,  and  maintaining  life 
support capabilities for the return trip, must be demonstrated. 

4.2.7 Scientific and Resource Knowledge 
The  Moon  is  a  natural  laboratory  for  studying  planetary  and  geologic  processes, 
described  more  fully  in  Appendix  9.6.  Among  many  others,  we  wish  to  explore  and 
expand our knowledge in the areas of:

1.  Volcanism.    It is useful to study history of lunar basalts from the beginning of the 
Moon’s  volcanism  to  the  most  recent  basalts  found  on  the  surface,  to  help 
determine the end of lunar volcanism. 
2.  Volatiles, including sources of water ice for possible in-situ resource production. 
3.  KREEP  basalts.    Discovered  during  the  Apollo  missions,  the  strange  basaltic 
material,  KREEP  (Potassium,  Rare  Earth  Elements,  and  Phosphorus)  is  the 
result  of  thermal  differentiation  of  rare  earth  elements  from  liquid  magma  during 
cooling. 
4.  The  poles.    The  poles  may  contain  water  ice;  they  are  also  interesting  due  to 
their consistent shade in certain places and small temperature variations. 
5.  Stratigraphy.   Certain  locations will help the study of crustal processes, allowing 
sampling of the most ancient materials. 
6.  Seismology.   A complex seismic network (Neal et al., 2003) would allow study of 
the lunar interior. 
7.  Helium-3.  Resource extraction with power implications. 

In addition to the scientific and resource knowledge potential of the Moon, it can also 
be  used  as  testbed  for  future  technologies  such  as  in-situ  propellant  production 
(ISPP) or as the location of an astronomical observatory. 

 

4.2.8 Knowledge Delivery Infrastructure 
The knowledge delivery infrastructure will consist of two parts: the delivery of data in the 
form  of  bits  and  the  delivery  of  samples  from  the  planets  surface.    This  section  is 
specifically  about  the  delivery  of  knowledge  in  the  form  of  bits.    This  delivery  of  bits  is 
referred to as the communication delivery system. 
 
The  same  communication  radio  frequency  has  been  selected  for  all  lunar  and  Martian 
missions in order to provide an easily extensible system.  The radio frequency that each 
of  these  missions  will  use  is  Ka-Band  or  32  gigahertz.    This  frequency  was  selected 
because  it  can  support  a  high  data  rate  with  comparably  lower  power  than  all  lower 
frequency  bands,  and  because  the  Deep  Space  Network  (DSN)  ground  infrastructure 
will  support  it  by  the  year  2007,  while  other  higher  frequency  bands  are  not  supported 
by  the  DSN.    There  is  some  concern  about  weather  interference  especially  when 
communicating  with  Mars,  however  a  Martian  sand  storm  would  prevent  an  X-band 
communication  as  it  would  a  Ka-band  communication,  the  differences  would  mainly  lie 
in the moderate weather such as a cloudy day, or light dust storm in which case the Ka-
bands data rate would be decreased. 
 
For the Short Stay Lunar Missions, a direct link can be set up between the Lunar Lander 
and one DSN station.  This would allow constant communication between Earth and the 
Moon  throughout  the  mission.    The  data  rate  required  for  this  mission  would  be 
approximately  0.07  megabits/sec  and  would  require  0.01  Watts  of  constant  power  per 
transmission  forty  minutes.    After  the  mission  is  completed  the  communication 
equipment  that  placed  on  the  Moon  will  be  left  there  for  two  reasons.  First,  if  a  future 
mission  decides  to  return  to  the  same  location,  placing  new  equipment  at  the 
destination  will  not  be  necessary.  Second,  in  the  unlikely  case  that  mission

      66              

 

communication equipment fails, the crew may have the option of traveling in a rover to a 
previous landing site to use the equipment left at that site. 
 
For  the  Medium  stay  missions,  the  infrastructure  is  essentially  the  same  as  the  Short 
mission.  The main difference, however, is that the medium mission requires higher data 
rates and transmitting power. The transmission data rate will be 0.7 megabits/sec with a 
required constant power of 0.1W over the forty minutes of transmission time 
 
The  long  stay  missions  require  the  ability  to  communicate  between  the  far  side  of  the 
Moon  and  Earth.   The  astronauts  will  communicate  through  one  of  four  possible 
ways.  For  the  first option, a communications  relay satellite placed at  the L4 point  in  the 
Earth  Moon  system.  This  infrastructure  allows  for  a  constant  communication  stream 
between  the  Earth  and  the  Moon.  Unfortunately,  this  option  would  only  allow  for 
communication for over 900km on the Moon’s far side at its center or 30 degrees off the 
far side facing the satellite.  The next option is to set up a relay satellite in low lunar orbit. 
This  infrastructure  is  capable of  covering most of  the Moon, but a  significant  time delay 
for  far side communications.  The  third option and  involves placing a satellite  in an orbit 
around  the  EM-L2  point.  The  coverage  area  provided  by  this  communications  satellite 
entirely covers the far side of the Moon and maintains nearly continuous communication 
with Earth. The shortcoming of this infrastructure lies in the difficulty of establishing orbit 
around  EM-L2.   The  transmission  data  rate  for  the  long  stay  missions  will  be  3.5 
megabits/sec with a required constant power of 0.5W over the forty minute transmission 
time  for  near-side  operations  and  a  required  constant  power  of  20W  for  far-side 
operations  over  the  same  transmission  time.    Please  note  that  the  equations  used  to 
determine these numbers are shown in Section 9.5.2. 

4.3 Mars Baselines 

4.3.1 Literature Review – A Brief History of Mars Mission Designs 
Humans  have  dreamed  of  travel  to  other  planets  for  centuries.    In  particular, Mars  has 
been  the  focus  of much  interest.   Arguably  the  first  actual mission  design  for Mars was 
presented  in  1952  by  rocket  engineer  Dr.  Wernher  von  Braun  (History  of  Humans  to 
Mars  website,  2004).    The  plan  was  immense  in  scale  and  involved  a  fleet  of 
interplanetary spaceships carrying  large crews  to Mars.     Because of  the corresponding 
cost  requirement,  von  Braun’s  design  it  did  not  become  reality.    Although  the  Space 
Race  between  USA  and  the  USSR  fuelled  interest  in  space  travel,  it  did  not  provide 
enough motivation to propel such an expensive plan forward. 
 
In  1989  political  interest  in  Mars  travel  was  revived  with  President  Bush’s  call  for  a 
Space  Exploration  Initiative,  and  it  resulted  in  a  study  known  as  “The  90  Day  Report.”  
This  report  resulted  in  a  projected  mission  to  Mars  cost  estimate  of  $450  billion.    The 
mission design  required assembly  in orbit of a 1000  tonne spacecraft as well as a  large 
orbiting  facility  to  enable  this  assembly  (History  of  Humans  to  Mars  website,  2004).  
Again  the high cost  ruled out  this humans-to-Mars  initiative, however, at  the same  time, 
a radically low cost architecture was being designed.

The  Mars  Direct  plan,  developed  by  Robert  Zubrin  and  David  Baker  at  Martin  Marietta 
Astronautics  Company  was  a  revolutionary  paradigm  shift  that  has  had  a  significant 
impact on Mars mission design.  The focus of this plan was to “live off the land” as much 
as  possible,  using  the  Martian  atmosphere  and  soil  to  provide  resources  and  in 
particular,  using  the  atmosphere  to  enable  in-situ  propellant  production  (ISPP)  of 
methane  and  oxygen  for  the  return  journey.    The  resulting  mass  required  in  LEO 
dropped  dramatically,  as  did  the  projected  cost  that  was  reduced  to  approximately 
twenty to thirty billion dollars (Zubrin, 1996). 
 
The Mars  Direct  approach  was  well  received  at  NASA  under  a  new  administration  and 
NASA  performed  its  own  study  and  corresponding  mission  design  in  the  late  1990s.  
This  study was  known  as  the Design Reference Mission  (DRM)  (Hoffman,  1997).    This 
study  relied  on  Zubrin’s  ideas  including  direct  travel  to  the  Martian  surface  and  ISPP, 
although  it was  scaled  up  in  some  respects,  having  a  crew  size  of  6  instead  of  4.    The 
cost estimate of such a mission was fifty billion dollars.  The significant difference was a 
two-stage  departure  from  Mars  as  opposed  to  the  direct  departure  planned  by  Zubrin.  
The DRM had a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) that rose from the surface of Mars via ISPP 
to rendezvous with an Earth Return Vehicle (ERV) for the trip back to Earth.  The trans-
Earth injection was predicated on the use of conventional fuel. 
 
Other  agencies  and  companies  have  proposed  Mars  mission  architectures  in  recent 
years.    One  ESA  scheme  designed  for  the  Aurora  program  attempts  to  extend  Lunar 
activities  towards  a Mars mission  design  (Aurora,  2002).    This  architecture  involves  an 
interplanetary  crew  transport  vehicle  that  travels  between  LEO  and  LMO,  two  Mars 
Excursion  Modules  that  serve  as  ascent/descent  vehicles  between  LMO  and  the 
Martian  surface,  and  a  Space  Shuttle-like  spacecraft  that  delivers  the  crew  to  the 
transport  vehicle.    This  design  encapsulates  redundancy  in  that  it  provides  a  backup 
ascent/descent  vehicle  as  well  as  a  backup  interplanetary  transport  vehicle  pre-
positioned  in  LMO  and  can  be  used  for  the  crew’s  journey  home  in  case  of  failure  of 
their primary vehicle. 
 
EADS  Space  Transportation  has  outlined  a  number  of  options  for  short  and  extended-
stay missions (Ransom, 2003) with short missions using Mars Orbit Rendezvous (MOR) 
and  landing  vehicles  for  crew  ascent  from  and  descent  to  the  surface  and  with  longer 
missions  using  ISPP  and  an  architecture  similar  to  NASA’s  DRM.    For  the  short  stay 
missions,  the main options are: pre-positioning,  the use of  ISPP  to  fuel ascent vehicles, 
and  dual  Lander  architectures  that  allow  the  exploration  of more  than  one  site.    Longer 
stay options include larger crew sizes, and fully established infrastructure. 
 
Global  Aerospace  Corporation  presents  an  interesting  approach  to  infrastructure  on 
Mars  (Nock,  2001)  with  the  use  of  “Astrotels”  cycling  between  Earth  and  Mars,  and 
“taxis” operating on rendezvous trajectories between these Astrotels and transport hubs 
such  as  orbiting  facilities.    This  concept  makes  use  of  highly  autonomous  on-board 
systems  to  control  the  operations  of  the  vehicles  when  they  are  not  crewed.  As  well,  it 
details  the  potential  of  harvesting  LOX  from  the  Moon  as  well  as  Phobos  and  using 
these resources to fuel interplanetary transfer.

Two  main  points  emerge  from  this  discussion.  One  is  that  ISPP  is  a  relevant  enabling 
technology with a good potential  for decreasing costs and allowing Mars missions  to be 
performed  more  frequently.    A  second  point  is  the  sense  that  there  is  not  a  single 
correct  architecture.    It  is  important  to  include  options  for  scalability  and  extensibility 
from  current  capabilities  to  reduce  cost  and  maintain  flexibility  in  mission  design; 
however,  this  can  be  accomplished  in  a  number  of  different  ways,  each  with  its  own 
benefits and penalties.  

4.3.2 Mars Baseline 

4.3.2.1 Introduction 
The  following  Mars  mission  architectures  are  predicated  on  the  idea  of  an  evolution  of 
mission scale and complexity starting with a rationale  for using Phobos as a preliminary 
step.    This  methodology  is  closely  aligned  with  the  message  presented  in  President 
Bush’s  New  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  Program  document.    In  addition,  the  mission 
architectures  defined  are  reliant  on  successful  demonstration  of  certain  technologies 
and  operations  on  the  Moon.    As  our  operations  knowledge  increases,  utilization  of 
complex  technologies  and  other  mission  enhancements  becomes  feasible  and  these 
enhancements are  incorporated  into  the mission profiles.   The aim  is  that  this evolution 
of missions  in  the  space  exploration  system  architecture will  provide  a means  to  create 
a  sustainable  transportation  network  and  infrastructure  for  travel  to  Mars  as  well  as  to 
develop the capacity for missions to future destinations. 
 
It  is  important  at  this  point  to  mention  how  the  crew  size  used  in  the  following  mission 
profiles  was  determined.    A  manned  mission  to  Mars  will  require  trip  times  well  in 
excess  of  any mission  thus  far.    This  extended  time  in  relative  seclusion  from  all  other 
personal  contact  suggests  the  need  for  a  large  crew  for  psychological  considerations.  
However,  this  need  must  be  balanced  with  mass  requirements  for  each  additional 
crewmember.   During  the mission, each astronaut will be  required  to perform a number 
of  functions  during  the  mission  due  to  long  communications  delays  require  a  higher 
level  of  autonomy.    There  appear  to  be  five  relevant  technical  fields  required  for 
exploration:  mechanical  engineer,  electric  engineer,  geologist,  life  scientist,  and 
physician.    In  addition  to  the  primary  specialty,  each  crewmember  would  need  to  be 
cross-trained  in another mission  critical  field and be  responsible  for a  variety of  support 
tasks  during  the  mission.    However,  with  only  a  crew  of  five,  a  single  loss  of  a 
crewmember,  even  temporarily  in  the  event  of  sickness,  could  jeopardize  the  mission.  
Thus a crew of six is recommended. (Hoffman, 1997) 
 
The plan  for  launching  the  required equipment needed  for missions  to Mars  into LEO  is 
mentioned in this section.  In order to achieve the enormous mass required in LEO for a 
manned Mars mission,  a  number  of  launches must  occur.    For  a Short Stay mission,  a 
number  of  elements  are  pre-positioned  in  Mars  orbit.    These  elements  are  transported 
using  electric  propulsion  and  thus  must  be  launched  approximately  two  years  prior  to 
crew  departure.   Using  the STS-derived  cargo  launcher,  three  launches  are  required  to 
place  the  propulsion  for  Earth  return,  the  Martian  Landers  and  the  surface  habitat  in 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      69              

 

LEO.    Prior  to  the  crew  launch,  the  Habitation  Module,  which  houses  the  crew  during 
transit  to  and  from  Mars,  is  launched  unmanned  into  LEO  using  two  heavy  lift  cargo 
launch  vehicles,  such  as  an  STS-derived  launch  vehicle.    Finally,  the  crew  travels  to 
LEO  in  two  separate  vehicles:  the Modern Command Module and  the Crew Operations 
Vehicle.    Both  of  these  components  can  be  launched  by  a  single  man-rated  launch 
vehicle such as a man-rated heavy EELV.   Thus,  for a short stay mission, a  total of  five 
STS-derived cargo launches and a single man-rated EELV are required. 
 
For  an Extended Stay mission,  an  even  larger mass  is  required  to  be  pre-positioned  at 
Mars  due  to  a  prolonged  surface  stay.    Two  years  prior  to  crew  departure,  the  pre-
positioned  elements  using  electric  propulsion  are  launched  via  four  STS-derived  cargo 
launchers.    Prior  to  launch,  the  Habitation  Module  is  launched  in  two  separate 
components  on  two  STS-derived  cargo  launchers.    Finally,  the  crew  is  launched  in  the 
crew  operations  vehicle  and  modern  command  module,  using  a  single  man-rated 
launch  vehicle.    Thus,  a  total  of  six  STS-derived  cargo  launchers  and  a  single  man-
rated launch vehicle are required. 

4.3.2.2 Assumptions 
Each  mission  defined  below  has  some  common  assumptions  built  into  the  design.  
These  assumptions  are  detailed  here 
to  emphasize  commonality  and  avoid 
unnecessary  repetition.    For  each  mission  to  Mars  a  crew  size  of  6  and  the  use  of 
chemical propulsion for crew transfer have been assumed.  Electrical propulsion is used 
for pre-positioned elements such as cargo and Landers. 
 
Since this report focuses on a strategy to achieve sustainability, certain specific mission 
details  are  not  explicitly  stated.    These  details  are  assumed.    They  include  such  items 
as  radiation  shielding  and  various  features  of  the  life  support  system  such  as  air-
regeneration facilities.   
 
The  general  mission  architecture  is  a  Mars  orbit  rendezvous  (MOR).    The  primary 
benefit  of  MOR  is  the  decoupling  of  in-space  transportation  from  descent  and  landing 
operations.    MOR  also  allows  flexibility  with  regards  to  the  timing  of  landing,  and  this 
may  prove  to  be  important  in  the  case  of  bad weather  on Mars.   Furthermore, because 
MOR  involves  landing  from  orbit  as  opposed  to  directly  from  the  trans-Mars  injection, 
landing precision can be improved.  This allows architectures to include a pre-positioned 
surface component, which corresponds to a reduction in propellant mass. 

4.3.2.3 Why Visit a Martian Moon as a Preliminary Step 
The Martian moons,  Phobos  (Fear)  and Deimos  (Terror), were  discovered  in  1877  and 
have  since  been  the  subject  of  long-range  observations  made  by  Earth-based 
telescopes  as  well  as  by  spacecraft  traveling  to  Mars.    Aside  from  their  inherent 
scientific  interest,  these  two Martian satellites could play a significant  role  in  the context 
of Mars exploration and in the extensibility of NASA’s space exploration initiative.

Figure 25: Phobos 

 

 
In  constructing  a Mars  exploration  strategy,  one  of  the  principal  objectives  is  to  expand 
human  knowledge  and  thus  engage  the  public.    For  this  reason,  it  is  anticlimactic  to 
send  humans  on  a  voyage  of  over  a  year  in  duration  only  to  enter  Mars  orbit  before 
returning  to  Earth.    However,  landing  on  Mars,  which  is  likely  to  be  achieved  via 
aerobraking and  rendezvous or docking operations,  is one of  the most dangerous parts 
of  the mission.    To mediate  the  risks  of  landing  and  surface  habitation  and  obviate  the 
requirement  of  a  human  mission  to  Martian  orbit,  it  is  suggested  that  the  preliminary 
Mars  mission  have  a  surface  component  on  one  of  the  Martian  satellites,  Phobos  or 
Deimos. 
 
New technology must be tested as much as possible before the first manned mission to 
Mars,  and  this  will  be  accomplished  primarily  by  using  the  Moon  as  a  testbed.  
Nevertheless,  due  to  the  inherent  differences  between  lunar  and  Martian  exploration 
missions,  the  first  human mission  to Mars  will  still  be,  in  some  respects,  a  venture  into 
the  unknown.    A  preliminary  mission  to  Phobos  or  Deimos  would  allow  NASA  to 
decouple  the  test  of  the  different  components  of  the  proposed  space  transportation 
system.  Humans  would  be  sent  on  a  Martian  trajectory  and  would  therefore  prove  the 
capabilities  of  the  transportation  system  and  vehicles  without  having  to  perform  the 
dangerous  task  of  landing  on Mars.    Instead,  the  landing maneuver would  be  limited  to 
a “docking” procedure  in  the micro gravity  (1/1000g) environment of Phobos or Deimos, 
and a surface stay in a location without atmosphere similar to that of the Earth’s Moon. 
 
A  preliminary  mission  to  Phobos  or  Deimos  would  also  lend  itself  to  extensibility 
because  it could be a stepping stone goal on  the way  to other exploration  initiatives.   A 
human  mission  to  one  of  the  Martian  satellites  would  allow  a  telerobotic  presence  on 
Mars  whereby  the  crew  could  control  rovers  on  the  Martian  surface  and  respond  to 
events  of  interest,  taking  advantage  of  the  minimal  communications  delay.    This  could 
also  aid  in  landing  site  certification.    In  addition,  because  these  two  moons  may  be 
captured  asteroids  or  at  least  very  similar  in  composition,  a  mission  to  these  bodies 
could prepare NASA for a future asteroid rendezvous mission while taking advantage of

      71              

 

the  moons’  predictable  orbits  (as  determined  precisely  by  the  1988  Soviet  Phobos 
mission  (Brat,  2001).    Looking  further  ahead,  a  mission  to  one  of  the  Martian  moons 
may help to provide NASA with some of the operational knowledge necessary for future 
exploration of the moons of Jupiter.  
 
Recent  initiatives  by  the Planetary  and Space Sciences Research  Institute  at  the Open 
University  in  the UK,  and  past  attempts  by  the Russian  space  program  underscore  the 
interest  in  Phobos  and  Deimos,  both  from  a  planetary  science  and  evolution  point  of 
view  and  from  a  resources  perspective.    Scientific  objectives  include:  distinguishing 
between origins models of the moons, establishing links between the moons and known 
asteroid  types,  and  studying  the mutual  effects Mars  and  its moons  have  had  on  each 
other  (Ball,  2004).    There  is  also  an  interest  in  the  Martian  moons  from  a  resources 
point of view, and it has been speculated that the moons may have frozen volatiles such 
as  water  ice  in  their  interiors  that  could  be  exploited  for  in-situ  propellant  production 
(Ball, 2004). 
 
Finally, a successful mission  to one of  the Martian moons would build public confidence 
and  spark  interest  in  the  space  exploration  problem.    This  would  enable  NASA  to  gain 
support for subsequent missions to Mars. 

4.3.2.4 Phobos Mission Design 
Phobos has been chosen as  the de  facto destination between  the  two Martian satellites 
since it is larger and closer to Mars.  A mission to Phobos would require remote sensing 
capabilities  to  survey  the  surface  for  potential  landing  sites  during  initial  flybys.    A 
landing  capability  would  also  be  required  to  allow  surface  exploration,  and  dedicated 
scientific payloads would be used to collect samples and perform geological testing. 
 
Since a crew would be sent to Phobos, a high priority would be to minimize transfer time 
and  hence  the  trans-Mars  injection  would  probably  follow  the  opposition-class  profile, 
making  use  of  a  Venus  flyby.    The  trajectory  to  Phobos  can  be  broken  into  seven 
sections as follows with various propulsive requirements (Brat, 2001):  
•  Vehicle launch and trans-Mars injection (TMI) 
•  Mid-course corrections and plane change in Earth-to-Mars trajectory  
•  Capture at Mars placing the vehicle in a near-Phobos “walking orbit” 
•  Rendezvous (circularization) with Phobos 
•  Station keeping at Phobos 
•  Lander descent and roving operations 
•  Attitude control during all of the above phases 
Of  these  maneuvers,  only  the  TMI  and  capture  at  Mars  would  have  significant  ∆V 
requirements,  on  the  order  of  4  km/s  and  2.7  km/s,  respectively.    Energy  requirements 
could be reduced via aerobraking by approximately 1.2 km/s (Brat, 2001), but this would 
add  to mission complexity and could be maintained as an option  if a  test of aerobraking 
is  required.    The  return  trajectory  requires  a  trans-Earth  injection  and  ballistic  entry  at 
Earth’s atmosphere.

4.3.2.5 Short-Stay Mission 
The  short-stay  mission  is  the  shortest  Mars  mission  possible  in  terms  of  total  mission 
duration;  it  is  composed  of  approximately  600  days  transit  time  and  60  days  surface 
stay  (Walberg,  1993).    The  crew  travels  to  Mars  via  an  opposition  class  free-return 
trajectory with a Venus fly-by  in the Mars Transfer Vehicle (MTV), which is composed of 
a Habitation Module (HM) and a Crew Operations Vehicle (COV).  Upon arrival at Mars, 
the  MTV  aerocaptures  into  Martian  orbit  and  performs  a  rendezvous  with  two  pre-
positioned Mars  landing  vehicles  (ML1  and ML2).   Three  crewmembers  descend  to  the 
Martian  surface  in  each  Lander.    This  allows  flexible  timing  for  each  landing,  with  the 
second  being  contingent  on  the  success  of  the  first.    The  landing  is  achieved  using  a 
heat  shield  for  atmospheric  entry  after  which  parachutes  are  deployed  to  slow  the 
spacecraft.    The  final  stage  of  the  landing  is  a  powered  touchdown  that  gives  the  crew 
as  much  control  as  possible  over  the  landing  so  as  to  minimize  risk  of  damage  to  the 
landing vehicle.  
 
The crew  remains on  the surface  for approximately 60 days.   During  this  time,  the crew 
lives  in  a  pre-positioned  surface  habitat  that  could  be  extended  by  an  inflatable module 
if more volume is required.  At the end of the surface stay, the crew returns to Mars orbit 
in  the  two  landing  modules  and  docks  with  the  MTV.    The  MTV  docks  with  the  pre-
positioned  return  propellant  module  (SM2)  and  executes  a  trans-Earth  injection 
maneuver.    Entry  back  into  low  Earth  orbit  (LEO)  is  achieved  via  aerocapture,  and  the 
MTV  docks  with  the  Modern  Command  Modules  (MCM)  allowing  half  of  the  crew  to 
transfer  into  this  Earth  re-entry  vehicle.    The  other  half  of  the  crew  returns  to  Earth’s 
surface  in  the  COV.    An  operational  overview  of  the  short-stay  mission  to  Mars  is 
provided in Figure 26.

Figure 26: Short stay mission to Mars 
 
During  the  surface  stay,  the  crew will  explore  the Martian  surface within  close  range  of 
their  landing site using EVA suits  in conjunction with an un-pressurized rover.   They will 
perform  activities  such  as  searching  for  water  and  life,  collecting  samples,  imaging  the 
surface,  and  recording  weather  phenomena.  Requirements  will  include  life  support 
facilities  in  the  surface  habitat,  radiation  shielding,  and  consumables.    An  adequate 
communications  network  will  also  be  required  for  this  mission  as  discussed  in  further 
detail in Section 4.3.4. 
 
To  facilitate  the short-stay mission, pre-positioning of mission elements  is employed.    In 
addition  to  the  pre-positioned Martian  Landers,  surface  habitat,  and  return  fuel;  surface 
equipment,  such  as  an  un-pressurized  rover  and  scientific  payloads  will  be  pre-
positioned  on  the  surface.    Pre-positioning  requires  a  farsighted  approach  to  mission 
planning,  but  this  should  be  well  within  the  scope  of  the  space  transportation  system 
outlined  here,  and  as  discussed  in  Section  6.4.3.1.4.1,  the  benefits  of  pre-positioning 
justify  the added constraints on mission  timeline.   Because  the pre-positioned elements 
will  make  use  of  electric  propulsion,  they  will  have  to  be  sent  at  the  launch  window 
approximately two years prior to that of the crew departure.

The  description  above  outlines  the  basic  structure  of  the  short-stay  mission;  however, 
there  are  several  options  available  for  such  a mission  that  would  improve  prospects  of 
extensibility  by  testing  enabling  technologies  for  a  subsequent mission.    The  first, most 
important  option  is  to  begin  verifying  and  testing  an  in-situ  propellant  production  (ISPP) 
plant.    An  ISPP  plant  would  allow  for  fuel  production  on  the  Martian  surface  as 
described  in  further  detail  in  Section  6.4.3.3.2.1.    This  option  would  require  a  pre-
positioned  propellant  production  module,  a  small  nuclear  power  plant,  and  a  hydrogen 
fuel  stock  for  a  Sabatier  process.    During  the  surface  stay,  the  crew  could  check  the 
functionality  of  the  ISPP  system  and  determine  if  it  is  reliable  for  propellant  production.  
In addition, the propellant could be used to augment power for surface systems, such as 
the  rover  vehicle.    This  option  would  facilitate  an  extensible  and  sustainable 
infrastructure for further Mars missions. 
 
Another  option  is  to  provide  extended  surface mobility.   This  could  be  accomplished  by 
providing  one  or more  remote-controlled  rovers  to  assist  in  surface  exploration.    These 
rovers  could  act  as  “scouts”  and  be  dispatched  to  areas  of  potential  interest  to 
determine which site holds the most interest for a follow-up visit by the crew. 

4.3.2.6 Extended-Stay Mission 
The  extended-stay  mission  offers  the  advantage  of  a  longer  surface  stay  with  only  a 
small  increase  in  the  total  mission  duration  over  the  short-stay  mission.    It  is  also  less 
complex  from a  trajectory perspective since  it does not  require a Venus  flyby  to provide 
the required ∆V.  Instead, for this mission, the crew travels to Mars in the MTV via a fast 
transfer  conjunction  class  trajectory.    In most  respects  the mission architecture  is  taken 
directly  from  the  short-stay  mission.    Assuming  the  short-stay  mission  precedes  the 
extended-stay,  the  required  operational  knowledge  to  carry  out  the  mission  should  be 
almost complete.  An operational view is presented in Figure 27.

Figure 27:  Extended stay mission to Mars 
 
One  of  the  main  differences  between  the  extended  and  short-stay  missions  is  the 
ascent  to  Mars  orbit  in  the  landing  modules.    Assuming  the  option  of  ISPP  during  a 
short-stay  mission  is  employed,  and  successfully  demonstrated,  the  ascent  propellant 
for  the  Landers  will  be  provided  in-situ  using  the  Sabatier  process.    Details  about  the 
Sabatier  process  are  available  in  Section  6.4.3.3.2.1.    This  will  change  the  mission 
requirements  slightly  in  that  an  ISPP  unit  consisting  of  hydrogen  feedstock,  a  chemical 
plant  and  a  nuclear  power  plant  will  have  to  be  sent  to  Mars  two  years  prior  to  the 
departure  of  the  crew,  and  it  will  necessarily  have  autonomous  communications  ability 
to relay its status to ground control centers on Earth.  This way, the crew will be assured 
that  the propellant  required  for  their ascent  from Mars has been generated prior  to  their 
departure.    In  addition,  since  the  Sabatier  process  produces  methane/oxygen  fuel,  the 
landing  module  will  have  to  be  able  to  dock  with  the  required  propellant  tanks  and 
engine.   All of  these components may have been pre-positioned prior  to crew departure 
or may be attached to the landing module itself.  Using ISPP to fuel the Landers’ ascent 
will  help  to  reduce  the mass  of  pre-positioned  cargo  and  thus  save mass  or  enable  the 
transportation of other  science payloads.   A  further advantage of using  ISPP  is  that  the 
fuel  produced  may  also  be  used  to  power  combustion  engine  rovers  and  possibly  life 
support  systems  as  well.    Finally,  the  functional  test  of  ISPP  at  this  stage  will  act  as  a 
stepping-stone  towards  the eventual goal of using  ISPP  to  fuel  the entire  return  journey 
to Earth.

Another  principal  distinction  between  extended  and  short-stay missions  is  the  length  of 
surface stay.   For an extended-stay,  the crew surface habitation module will need  to be 
considerably  larger  than  that  of  a  short-stay mission.   To  this  end,  an  inflatable module 
or an additional habitation module will be pre-positioned 
 
Besides  the  obvious  extensive  life  support  requirements  for  a  mission  of  this  duration, 
the  crew  will  require  an  extended  means  of  exploration  equipment  for  this  mission.  
Along with EVA suits, a transport vehicle, open or pressurized, will be pre-positioned,  to 
enhance  surface mobility.   An open, un-pressurized,  rover  is  limited  to  ranges of 10km, 
such  that  the  crew  is  always  within  walking  distance  of  the  surface  habitat.    However, 
this  safety  requirement  highly  constrains  the  amount  of  exploration  that  can  be 
accomplished during  this  long duration mission.   Therefore, although not a requirement, 
a pressurized  rover capable of  ranges on  the order of 500km  is a  recommended option 
for  the  long-stay mission.   This will allow  the crew  to explore a  large area, searching  for 
water and life, collecting samples to return to Earth, and taking various measurements.   
 
In  addition  to  the  large-scale  physical  exploration  of  the  Martian  surface,  the  crew  will 
have  the  opportunity  to  conduct  more  advanced  scientific  experiments  including 
experiments  that  may  require  a  longer  duration,  such  as  small-scale  agriculture 
development.    The  construction  of  an  inflatable  greenhouse  prototype  is  one  option  for 
the  extended-stay mission.    This  could  supplement  the  crew’s  food  supply  for  both  the 
surface stay and Earth return trip. 
 
Another  important  option  to  consider  would  be  to  include  a  pressurized  surface 
transportation  vehicle  to  satisfy  the  surface  mobility  requirement.    This  pressurized 
vehicle,  with  a  mass  of  approximately  6000kg,  would  allow  for  a  “shirtsleeve” 
environment for up to three astronauts on sorties on the order of 500 km and 400 hours 
duration.    For  safety  reasons,  two  pressurized  rovers would  have  to  be  sent  to Mars  to 
ensure  rescue  capability.    It  is  likely  that  these  vehicles  would  be  sent  separately  from 
the crew via a direct  launch  in conjunction with other cargo  such as extra  food supplies 
or a power plant. 
 
Further options  that would  facilitate movement  towards a semi-permanent  infrastructure 
include  the  development  of  ISPP  to  a  high  enough  level  of  production  and  reliability, 
such that it would be used to supply the return fuel for the MTV in subsequent missions.  
Also,  a  drilling  device  that  could  be  transported  as  pre-positioned  cargo  to  tap  into 
subsurface  aquifers  if  it was  determined  in  the  short  stay  or  robotic  precursor missions 
that  underground  water  may  exist.    Since  surface  life  support  systems  require  a 
substantial  power  supply,  a  nuclear  power  plant  could  be  pre-positioned.    Finally,  a 
closed  loop  life-support  system  with  bioregenerative  components  could  be  tested.  
Although this technology would not be implemented until its reliability is ensured, such a 
technology would help a self-sustained presence on Mars become more feasible. 
 
A comparison of the ∆V requirements for the Short and Extended Stay missions to Mars 
is  shown  in  the  following  tables.   Table  5  shows  the ∆V  requirements  for  the Short  and

If  it  aerobraking  is  assumed  for  use  in  one  of  the  Mars  missions,  the  ∆V  numbers  in 
Table  6  for  the  stages  of  the mission  in which  aerobraking  is  used,  such  as  Earth  orbit 
insertion, are  ignored  for propulsive engine burn requirements.    Instead,  the  initial mass 
required  for  the  aerobraking  maneuver  is  assumed  to  be  15%  of  the  payload  mass 
(Walberg, 1993). 

4.3.2.7 Extended-Stay Mission with Infrastructure 
The  final  mission  class  is  the  extended-stay  mission  with  the  development  of 
infrastructure.    The  idea  behind  this  architecture  is  that  if,  after  previous  short  and 
extended-stay  missions,  Mars  remains  an  interesting  destination  either  from  a  science 
or  operations  perspective.    Another  possibility  is  that  Mars  can  serve  as  a  testing 
ground  for  the  next  exploration  target.    Subsequent  Mars  missions  will  then  develop 
infrastructure to facilitate surface stays and exploration as well as to minimize mass that 
has to be transported from Earth. 
 
In  this  case,  the  aim  of  the  mission  is  to  use  in-situ  resources  as  much  as  possible.  
These  resources  are  used  to  provide  return  fuel,  generate  power,  develop  sustainable 
agriculture,  and  enable  closed  loop  life  support.   Missions  to Mars will  take  place more 
frequently, possibly with one crew traveling at every launch opportunity 
 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      78              

 

The  initial  architecture  will  follow  the  proven  MOR  scheme  for  a  long-stay  conjunction 
class  mission,  but  assuming  previous  attempts  at  ISPP  generation  and  fuelled  ascent 
have been successful, it is likely that the architecture design will become more similar to 
Mars  Direct  (Zubrin,  1996).    The  eventual  outcome  of  this  transition  would  be  that  the 
MTV would  travel directly  to  the surface of Mars without orbital  rendezvous and ascend 
from  the Martian surface using  ISPP  fuel directly  into a  trans-Earth  injection.   The result 
of a move towards this architecture would be a significant reduction in IMLEO. 
 
For  these  extended-stay missions,  pressurized  transport  vehicles will  be  pre-positioned 
allowing  the  crew  to  have  significant  surface  mobility  on  the  order  of  500km.    As 
previously  mentioned,  two  pressurized  rovers  will  be  necessary  to  provide  a  rescue 
capability.   The crew will conduct science experiments as described above.    In addition, 
the  scientific  payloads will  be  chosen  to  explore  areas  that  have  been  proven  to  be  the 
most  interesting  in previous missions as well as any other new areas of  interest.       The 
ECLSS will be designed  to achieve as close  to 100% closure as possible, and  the crew 
will  derive  most  of  their  power  from  ISPP.    Agricultural  facilities  such  as  inflatable 
greenhouses  will  be  installed  to  provide  or  supplement  the  crew’s  food  supply.    The 
crew  habitat  will  take  the  form  of  multiple  inflatable  modules  as  well  as  pre-positioned 
Habitat modules sent direct from Earth.   
 
The  extended-stay  mission  with  infrastructure  will  provide  a  testbed  for  further 
exploration  technology  development,  and  it  is  also  possible  that  the  ISPP  facilities  will 
allow Mars to serve as a way station for vehicles traveling to more remote destinations. 

4.3.3  Commonality 
The  four missions  described  above,  from  a  preliminary mission  to  Phobos  through  to  a 
mission  for  an  extended  stay  on  the Martian  surface,  are  designed  for  logical  evolution 
from  one  to  the  next.    With  this  in  mind,  there  is  significant  commonality  between  the 
missions.    In  all  cases,  one  mission  provides  a  testbed  for  the  technology  that  is 
required  for  subsequent  missions.    A  Phobos  mission  presents  the  opportunity  to  test 
the  in-space  transportation system  that will be used  to  reach Mars during  the short-stay 
mission.    Furthermore,  the  short-stay  mission  allows  the  test  of  aerobraking,  landing, 
surface  habitation,  and  in-situ  propellant  production  that  will  all  be  used  during  the 
extended-stay  mission.    Finally,  during  the  extended  stay  mission,  more  advanced 
technologies  such  as  agriculture  can  be  tested  in  preparation  for  the  next mission  with 
infrastructure.    The  missions  to  Mars  as  described  above  would  also  be  useful 
preparation for further destinations such as asteroids or Jovian moons.   

4.3.4 Knowledge Delivery Infrastructure  
For the short-stay sized Mars missions a direct link can be set up between the Mars  
Lander  and  one  of  the  Earth’s  Deep  Space  Network  (DSN)  stations.    This  would  allow 
semi-frequent  communication  between  Earth  and  Mars  throughout  the  entire  mission.  
The data rate required for this mission would be 1 gigabit/day and would require 8 watts 
of power per  transmission with a  transmission data rate of 0.04 megabits/sec.   After  the 
mission is completed the communication equipment that was landed on Mars will be left 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      79              

 

there  for  two  reasons,  one  if  a  future  mission  decides  to  use  that  spot  as  a  landing  or 
settlement  site  then  they  won’t  have  to  bring  their  own  equipment,  and  in  the  unlikely 
case  that  another  future mission  communication  equipment  fails  the  crew  will  have  the 
option of traveling in a rover to the old site and using its equipment. 
 
The  extended-stay missions  require  the  ability  to  communicate  with much  greater  data 
rate  and  thus  it  might  be  necessary  to  create  a  relay  satellite  around  Mars.   There  are 
two  realistic  options  for  the  location  of  this  satellite.   The  satellite  could  be  placed  in  a 
Geostationary  Martian  orbit  (GMO)  around  the  landing  site;  the  advantage  of  a  GMO 
satellite is that it increases the time that the astronauts can communicate with the Earth, 
the  disadvantage  is  that  it  can  only  really  be  set  up  for  one  portion  of  the  planet.    The 
other  option  is  to  position  a  satellite  at  the  Earth-Mars  L1  point  thus  decreasing  the 
power  required  to  send  large  communication  streams  to  the  Earth;  unfortunately  this 
would  not  add  any  extra  time  that  the mission  could  communicate with  the  ground.   As 
with  the Moon missions  there  is  an  option  in  the  case  of  emergencies  to  communicate 
with the Moon and use it as a relay station.  The daily data rate for a large sized mission 
would be 10 gigabits/day, the transmission data rate would be 0.4 megabits/sec and the 
transmission  power  required  would  be  approximately  80  W.    Please  note  that  the 
equations used to determine the numbers used in this section are in Section 9.5.2. 

4.4. Transport 
The purpose of this section  is to highlight the commonality between the Moon and Mars 
missions  within  the  framework  of  a  baseline  set  of  forms  that  will  each  perform  certain 
functions  in  order  to  complete  a  baseline  mission.    The  forms  used  to  accomplish  a 
baseline mission are described below. 

4.4.1. Selection of Forms 
The baseline mission suggests  forms  for specific  functions.   The purpose of developing 
a  baseline  mission  is  twofold.    Firstly,  with  forms  specified,  the  missions  to  the  Moon 
and Mars  can  define  functional  requirements  that  are  desired  of  each  form.    Secondly, 
specification  of  forms  creates  a  framework  for  comparing  missions  and  evaluating  the 
attributes of each mission. 
 
The  method  of  selecting  this  baseline  mission  was  based  on  the  first  draft  of 
requirements  for  a Mars mission.   A Mars mission was  selected  as  a  starting  point  and 
analyzed  considering  the  impact  of  each  mission  decision  on  the  extensibility  of  this 
architecture  from  a  Moon  mission.    The  architecture  was  designed  considering 
reconfigurability,  adaptability  and  extensibility  of  a  Moon  mission  to  a  Mars  mission.  
Each  decision  required  specification  of  the  baseline  architecture  and  evaluation  based 
on  its  influence on a Short, Extended or Extended+, Mars or Moon mission.  Once each 
form was  selected,  specific  details  of  the  functions  for  each  form were  specified  for  the 
Mars and Moon missions. 

4.4.2. Summary of Baseline Forms 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      80              

 

A  baseline  mission  was  developed  to  create  a  complete  list  of  forms  required  to 
accomplish  the Mars  and Moon missions.    The  baseline mission  includes  assumptions 
based  on  current  technology  limitations,  safety  concerns,  and  policy  requirements  to  a 
lesser  extent.    These  assumptions  influence  the  technology  of  each  form,  but  not  the 
functional  requirements  of  the  forms.    The  focus  of  the  baseline  mission  was  not  to 
develop  another  detailed  description  and  analysis  of  the  forms  required  for  an 
extensible  Mars  mission.    Instead,  a  framework  is  created  that  provides  a  method  of 
comparing the functional requirements for each of the Mars and Moon missions.  Details 
of the forms are provided in Section 6.4.3.1. 
 
A schematic representation of the baseline mission is shown visually in  
Figure 28 and can be summarized as, 
 

•  Pre-position in LEO (HM, SM1) 
•  Pre-position in Destination orbit (SM2, ML1, ML2) (LL1, LL2 for Moon mission) 
•  Launch MCM and COV into LEO on man-rated launcher. 
•  Sequentially dock MCM and COV to HM (undock MCM and leave in LEO) 
•  Dock SM1 to COV/HM (This combination is known as the MTV) 
•  Transit to destination, undock SM1 
•  Burn into Lunar orbit or aerocapture into Mars orbit (mission specific) 
•  ML1&ML2 (LL1&LL2 for Moon mission) sequentially dock and undock with MTV 
•  Crew ascends to destination surface and ascends to orbit 
•  ML1&ML2  (LL1&LL2  for  Moon  mission)  dock  and  transfer  crew  to  MTV 
(ML1&ML2 stay in orbit) 
•  Dock SM2 to MTV  
•  Transit to Earth, undock SM2 
•  Aerocapture at Earth 
•  Dock MCM to HM, transferring crew of three 
•  Remaining crew of three enter COV 
•  COV & MCM Earth EDL 

 
Many  decisions  regarding  sustainability  and  extensibility were made  in  determining  this 
baseline mission.    As  such,  a  number  of  trade  studies  were  considered  and  presented 
in later sections of this report (see Chapter 6).

4.4.2.1. Pre-position in Mars or Moon Orbit 
Pre-positioning  crew  habitation  modules,  fuel  for  return  transport,  Landers,  and  return 
capsules allow  the mass of  the module  transporting  the crew  to  the Moon or Mars  to be 
reduced.    Although  pre-positioning  modules  reduces  the  injected  mass  required  for  a 
mission,  additional  difficulties  are  adopted.    These  difficulties  include  on-orbit  docking 
capability  and  increased  complexity  in  pre-positioned  module  functionality.    Safety 
concerns are also raised because pre-positioning return fuel for the first mission to Mars 
will require a high level of confidence in the technology.  As such, carrying return fuel for 
the  first  Mars  mission  increases  confidence  while  providing  a  method  of  developing  a 
stockpile  of  fuel,  which  could  be  used  on  Mars  or  as  a  safety  measure  for  future  Mars 
missions.    A  detailed  description  and  justification  for  pre-positioning  is  presented  in 
Section 6.4.3.1.4. 
 
Based on  the assumption of pre-positioning mass  in Earth and  the destination orbit,  the 
following modules are pre-positioned in Martian orbit and correspondingly for Lunar orbit 
for the Moon mission: 
 

1.  Service  Module  #2  (SM2)  –  As  an  assumed  function,  this  module  must  be 
capable  of  providing  propulsion  for  transiting  the  crew  from  Martian  (or  lunar) 
orbit to Earth orbit. 
2.  Two  Lunar  or  Mars  Landers  (ML1  &  ML2  or  LL1  &  LL2)  –  Two  identical  Apollo 
type  Landers  (slightly  different  forms  for  Moon  and  Mars),  each  capable  of 
transporting  three  crewmembers  from  orbit  to  the  surface.    Functionally,  only

      82              

 

minimal  redesign  is  required  for  Lunar  landing  capabilities  (see  Section 
6.4.3.1.6.).  As such, the Moon can be a “true testbed” for the Lander technology.  
An option also exists  to  re-use  the Landers  for  the Moon mission because  there 
is  no  heat  shield  requirement  for  a  lunar  landing  (see  Section  6.4.3.1.6.)   Both 
Landers  must  have  propulsive  capabilities  in  addition  to  the  requirements  for 
pre-positioning.    This  extra  propulsion  redundancy  allows  either  the  Lander  to 
dock with the HM or the HM to dock with the Lander in Mars orbit (or Lunar orbit).  
Although  there  is  increased  mass  associated  with  two  three  crew  Landers  as 
compared to one six crew Lander, 
•  This  technology  is  modular  and  extensible  to  a  Mars  mission  (6 
crewmembers) from a Moon mission (3 crewmembers). 
Increased  reliability  and  flexibility  observed  because  if  one  Lander 
were  deemed  unusable,  the  second  Lander  could  still  perform  the 
desired mission objectives. 
A  detailed  trade  study  that  discusses  the  above  can  be  found  in  Section 
6.4.3.1.6.2. 

• 

4.4.2.2. Pre-position Cargo on the surface of Mars or the Moon 
Similarly,  pre-positioning  all  of  the  necessary  cargo  for  Mars  and  Moon  surface 
habitation,  on  the  surface,  in  a  separate  mission,  reduces  the  payload  mass  that  must 
be  launched  from  Earth  or  LEO.    For  surface  habitation,  if  the  environments  were 
deemed  similar  in  design  requirements,  an  option  may  be  to  use  a  duplicate  of  the 
habitation module on the surface of Mars.  Details of the surface habitation modules are 
given in Appendix 9.2. 

4.4.2.3. Pre-position in Earth Orbit 

4.4.2.2.1. Non human-rated launches 
The following items will also be pre-positioned in LEO. 
 

1.  Habitation Module (HM) – This module will be launched in pieces and assembled 
in  LEO,  allowing  the  overall  volume  to  not  be  limited  by  the  minimum  launch 
volume requirements.  Since there are many modules, none, one or many can be 
used  for  each  mission,  depending  on  the  mission  requirements  for  duration  and 
crew  size.    This  module  must  have  propulsion  capabilities  to  perform  docking 
maneuvers in both Earth and Mars (or Lunar) orbit. 

2.  Service Module #1 (SM1) – This module must be capable of providing propulsion 
for  transiting  the  crew  from  Earth  orbit  to  Martian  orbit  or  Lunar  Orbit  (Note  that 
SM2  was  used  for  (Mars  or  Moon)  to  Earth  transit).    This  module  will  require 
minimal  redesign  to  be  truly  extended  for  use  on  a  Mars  mission  (the  same 
interface and platform could be used).

      83              

 

Since  no  crews  are  launched  into  LEO  during  the  pre-positioning  phase,  all  launches 
can  take  place  on  non-man-rated  launchers.    This  serves  to  increase  launch  flexibility 
and lower overall cost.  

4.4.2.2.2. Human-rated Launches 
By  using  a  pre-positioning  approach,  only  a  single  man-rated  launch  is  required  to 
deliver  the  six  crewmembers  (or  three  crewmembers  for  smaller Moon missions)  to  the 
Habitation Module.  The launched modules include: 
 

1.  Modern Command Module (MCM) – The Modern Command Module is discussed 
in  Section  6.4.3.1.1.1.    This  module  will  dock  with  the  Habitation  Module  and 
return  crew  back  to  Earth  from  LEO  at  the  end  of  the  mission.  This  module  is 
also capable of docking and delivering the crew of three to the Habitation Module 
(HM).    Note  that  this module  will  not  travel  to  the  destination  with  the  Habitation 
module,  but  only  serves  as  a  means  of  transporting  the  crew  to  and  from  Earth 
(first and final phases of the mission).   Since some of  the defined Moon missions 
specify  a  crew  of  three  instead  of  a  crew  of  6,  a  three-crewmember  transfer 
vehicle was chosen  to  reduce  the mass  launched on a human  rated  launcher  for 
the  three  crewmember  Moon  missions.    This  was  also  done  to  ensure  that  the 
Earth  to  LEO  and  LEO  to  Earth  transfer  vehicle  was  not  over  designed  for  a 
three-crewmember Moon mission.  This can be done because the mission scales 
via  the  number  of  Habitation  modules  (see  Section  6.4.3.1.3.)  used  and  not  the 
size  of  the  LEO  crew  transport  vehicle.    A  detailed  crew  vehicle  scaling  analysis 
and justification for this decision are presented in Appendix 9.1. 

 
2.  Crew Operations Vehicle  (COV) – This module docks and delivers  the  remaining 
three  crewmembers  to  the  Habitation  Module  in  the  same  manner  as  MCM.  
However,  this module  does  not  remain  in  LEO  during  the mission.    Instead,  this 
module  travels  with  or  without  the  HM  to  the  destination.    Functionally,  this 
vehicle must  provide  all  the  necessary  functions  of  a  crew  transport module  (i.e. 
docking  capabilities,  GNC,  radiation  protection,  thermal  control,  ECLSS,  attitude 
control, communication equipment, etc.).  The reasons for choosing an additional 
module that travels with the HM are twofold: 
•  Having  a COV  separates  the  functions  for  crew  transport,  allowing  the 
mission  to  scale  down  to  transporting  a  crew  in  only  the  COV  to  the 
Moon  for a Short Moon mission,  to scaling up  to  transporting a crew  in 
the COV & HM to Mars for the Extended Mars mission. 
•  Having  the  smallest  mass  and  volume  re-entering  Earth  at  the  end  of 
the  mission  is  beneficial  to  reducing  the  mass  penalty  of  the  mission.  
This is further described in Section 6.4.3.1.1.1. 

 
All modules  considered  common  interfaces  and  serve  specific  functions.   Details  of  the 
launch  logistics,  timing  and  forms  for  both  the  human  rated  and  non-human  rated 
launches are presented in Section 6.4.2.2.

Now  that all of  the modules have been pre-positioned, SM1 docks with  the HM  in Earth 
orbit.    To  perform  this  docking,  it  is  necessary  that  SM1  and  HM  both  have  propulsion 
capabilities  for  added  redundancy.   After  this  docking  is  complete,  the COV  docks with 
the HM  and  SM1.    These  three modules  comprise  the  entire  crewed  vehicle  that  travel 
to Mars or the Moon, known as the Moon/Mars Transfer Vehicle (MTV) (see Figure 29).

Figure 29: Mars/Moon Transfer Vehicle (MTV) 

 

4.4.2.5. Entering Destination Orbit 
The MTV (COV/HM/SM1) attains Martian orbit by aerocapture.  This requires the use of 
the COV heat shield and additional protection for the HM in contact with the atmosphere.  
It  is  assumed  that  the  shielding  could  be  modular  (i.e.  detachable)  to  ensure  HM 
extensibility  remains  intact.   Prior  to entering Martian or Lunar orbit, SM1 undocks  from 
the MTV, reducing  the aerocapture mass (at Mars) or  the mass of  fuel required  to enter 
Lunar Orbit.  

4.4.2.6. Descending and Ascending 
Two pre-positioned Landers dock sequentially  (ML1 & ML2 or LL1 & LL2),  requiring  the 
HM  to  have  only  one  docking  interface  for  the  Landers.    Three  crewmembers  transfer 
into  each  Lander,  and  then  descend  to  the  surface.    In  a  similar  manner  to  the  Apollo 
Missions,  the Landers ascend  to Mars/Lunar orbit.   Details of  the Lander are presented 
in Section 6.4.3.1.6. 

4.4.2.7. Orbit, Injection and Transfer to Earth Orbit 
Once  the  Landers  dock  sequentially  with  the  MTV,  a  second  Service  Module  (SM2) 
consisting of the necessary propulsion to return the crew to Earth docks with the MTV in 
orbit.    These  three  modules  (COV/HM/SM2)  comprise  the  entire  vehicle  that  travels 
back  to Earth.   The  vehicle  is  identical  to  the MTV  that  transited  from Earth  to Mars  (or 
Earth  to Moon)  with  the  exception  of  SM2  now  being  used  in  place  of  SM1.    Note  that 
the Landers do not return to Earth with the crew for the Mars mission, but could possibly 
be reused for the Moon mission.

      85              

 

4.4.2.8. Returning to Earth 
The MTV attains Earth orbit by aerocapture.  For the Mars mission, the same MTV heat 
shield  used  for  aerocapture  at Mars  is  used  at  Earth.   While  in  Earth  orbit,  the Modern 
Command  Module  (MCM)  docks  with  the  HM  and  the  crews  of  three  enter  their 
respective  modules  (COV  or  MCM).    MCM  and  COV  undock  from  HM  and  reenter.    If 
the  MTV  were  capable  of  direct  entry,  an  aerocapture  maneuver  would  be  eliminated 
and  an  argument  could  be  made  for  MTV  re-usability.    However,  at  this  stage  it  is 
difficult  to  foresee  whether  the  entire  Habitation  Module  could  handle  the  heat  load  of 
re-entry, especially after experiencing the heat  load associated with aerocapture at both 
Mars  and Earth.     For  a Moon mission  an  argument  could  be made  for MTV  reusability 
because aerocapture is not required to enter lunar orbit.

5.  Commonality Across Missions 

 

5.1 Introduction 
NASA’s current direction is return to exploring the Moon, then explore Mars and beyond. 
It  is  with  this  in  mind  that  we  are  proposing  a  high-level  set  of  causally  connected 
baseline missions. These missions are aimed at a continued expansion outward into the 
solar system, with no single ultimate destination. The experience and knowledge gained 
from  one  mission  will  be  put  to  use  on  the  following  missions,  thereby  enabling  future 
exploration. To recognize this fact  is to understand that commonality must play a critical 
role  in  all  extensible  space  exploration  system.  It  is  by  searching  for  commonality 
between  aspects  in  the  forms  and  functions  of  these  missions  that  they  may  be 
integrated to generate one consistent over-arching program plan. 

5.2. Commonality 
Each  of  the  proposed  missions  for  the  Moon  and  Mars  contains  a  number  of 
requirements.   Clearly,  the  requirements  of  each module  (or  form)  vary  from mission  to 
mission,  but  the  objective  of  an  extensible  set  of  mission  architectures  is  to  utilize  as 
many functions as is feasible for each form.  Deciding the “as  is feasible” is difficult, and 
as  such,  the  following  method  of  comparison  aims  to  illustrate  the  functional 
requirements of each form that are not clearly demonstrated in the baseline mission. 
 
The  requirements  were  specified  for  three  Moon  missions:  Short,  Medium,  and 
Extended.    These  were  also  specified  for  the  four  Mars  Missions:  Phobos,  Short, 
Extended,  and  Extended+.    Basic  forms  were  selected  and  the  functions  were 
discussed  for  each  form.    Each  mission  was  considered  independently  in  the  analysis 
below.   For example,  if an Extended+ Mars mission  requires  that  the COV be equipped 
with an aeroshield, while the other three Mars missions do not, the Mars set of missions 
are  assumed  to  require  an  aeroshield,  however  these  situations  are  indicated  in  the 
table located below the Venn diagrams in the following figures. 
 
This  method  of  analysis  allows  functional  traits  of  a  form  to  be  easily  evaluated  and 
compared with  the other  required  functions  in  terms of  importance across  the entire set 
of mission objectives.  If a form does cannot perform a specific function, a decision must 
be  made  as  to  whether  or  not  extending  the  functionality  of  a  form  to  include  other 
functions  is  justified  or  whether  an  additional  form  should  be  developed  to  serve  the 
functional requirements flow down from the Mars and Moon mission objectives. 

5.2.1 Form/Function Mapping 
The  following  sections  will  present  an  analysis  of  the  form/function matrix  by means  of 
Venn  diagrams.  This  is  a  helpful  tool  in  deciding  what  functions  each  form  should  be 
able to perform, depending on the needs for specific Moon/Mars missions. 
 
Although  the  shared  portion  of  the  Venn  diagram  is  critical  to  both  Mars  and  Moon 
missions, it is the regions on the right and left of the Venn diagram that impact individual 
missions  within  the  respective  Mars  and  Moon  mission  frameworks.    Therefore, 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      87              

 

considering each of the functions in these areas of the Venn diagram allows the mission 
designer  to  decide  when  a  new  form  capable  of  accomplishing  the  functions  not 
included  in  the  “overlap”  region of  the Venn diagram should be added  to  the network of 
modules.

5.2.1.1. Crew Operations Vehicle 
The  Crew  Operations  Vehicle  (COV)  is  part  of  the  crew  exploration  system.  It  is 
designed for transporting a crew of three from Earth to the destination and back, with or 
without  the  help  of  the  Habitable  Module  (HM).    Specific  details  of  the  COV  were 
discussed  in  Section  4.1.1,  but  from  the  Form/Function  Matrix  results  (see  Appendix 
9.2.1)  a  Venn  diagram  of  functional  requirements  for  the  COV  was  determined  and 
shown in Figure 30.

Figure 30: Functional requirements for a Crew Operations Vehicle 

 
Considering  Figure  30,  the  COV  must  be  capable  of  providing  attitude  control  and 
communications  for  a  crew  of  three,  as  well  as  additional  human  space  flight 
requirements  for  both  the Moon  and Mars missions.   Based  on  this  diagram,  additional 
forms must be created in addition to the base form to accomplish the required additional 
functions. 
 
Since  it  is  beneficial  to  have  a  minimum  number  of  forms  in  addition  to  an  extensible 
network  of  forms,  it  is  important  that  some  of  the  functions  required  of  a  COV  be 
captured by  the baseline COV.   For example, docking with  the HM  reduces  the number 
of functions required of a COV because the HM can provide some of the functions listed 
for  the  COV.    Since  the  functions  listed  in  Figure  30  include  the  unique,  additionally 
complex Extended+ Mars mission,  it is difficult to truly evaluate how extensible the COV 
should  be.    For  example,  the  Extended+  mission  is  the  only  mission  that  requires  the 
COV  be  capable  of  ascending  and  descending  to  the  surface  of  Mars.    This  single 
functional  requirement  is essential  for only one of  the seven missions. Furthermore,  the 
particular  mission  that  requires  this  added  ability  is  well  in  the  future.  Thus,  not  only  is 
the mission  less  likely to be carried out as planned, but the expected knowledge returns 
from  this  mission  would  diminish  considerably  upon  discounting  to  present  value.  
Considering  the  environment  of  uncertainty  surrounding  activities  that  are  so  far 
removed  in  time,  this  function  should  not  be  captured  by  the  COV  unless  it  could  be 
added  at  low  cost.    An  additional  or  alternative  crew  vehicle  form  might  suffice  in  the 
future. 
 
For  the Short Moon missions,  the COV  is  required  to  support  one  person  in  orbit.   This 
extends  the  period  of  time  that  the  COV  must  provide  life  support.    For  the  Extended 
Moon mission,  the COV  is  required  to  sustain  unmanned  orbit.   This  situation  indicates 
that either an additional  form should be added  to  the network or  the additional  functions 
be  adopted  by  the  COV.    This  important  decision  is  made  easier  when  all  of  the  low-
level  functions  can be  considered  together.   The COV will be  required  to  re-enter Earth 
ballistically  for  the  Short  and  Medium  Moon  missions.    This  delays  the  requirement  of 
Earth  aerocapture  technology  until  the  Extended  Moon  mission,  allowing  the  Moon 
missions to be a “true testbed.” 

5.2.1.2. Modern Command Module 
The Modern Command Module (MCM) is the form specified for the Earth launch module 
in  the  initial phase of  the mission and Earth EDL  in  the  final phase of  the mission.   The 
MCM  resembles  an  Apollo-style  command  module,  capable  of  transporting  crew  from 
the  Earth’s  surface  to  orbit  and  back  to  Earth  from  orbit,  but  without  the  required 
capability  of  transit  to  the  Moon.    Specific  details  of  this  module  were  discussed  in 
Section  4.4.2.2.2,  but  from  the  Form/Function  Matrix  results  (see  Appendix  9.2.1)  a 
Venn  diagram  of  functional  requirements  for  the  MCM  was  determined  and  shown  in 
Figure 31.

Figure 31: Functional requirements for a Modern Command Module 

 
It  is evident that the requirements for Earth  launch are similar for all of the missions and 
independent  of  the  mission  objective.    This  indicates  that  the  MCM  is  an  extensible 
architectural  element  for  these  functions.    The  only  specific  requirements  that  differ 
between  the  Mars  and  Moon  missions  are  the  number  of  days  of  life  support  and  the 
number  of  crew  that  must  be  transported.    The  number  of  days  of  life  support  was 
estimated  based  on  the  expected  assembly  time  in  orbit.    Providing  additional  life 
support  for  the  longest  possible  duration  in  the  MCM  is  not  a  difficult  function  to 
incorporate  in  the  baseline  MCM.    Rather  than  developing  two  functionally  equivalent 
modules  such  as  a  three-person  and  a  six-person  module,  many  benefits  exist  when 
two identical forms (COV is a similar to the MCM) are used in place of a different form to 
perform the same list of functions.  This premise was discussed in Section 6.4.3.1.1.1. 

5.2.1.3. Habitation Module 
A Habitation Module  (HM), as  the name  indicates,  is a module  that supports human  life 
on  long  duration missions.   While  the  transit  durations  for  the Moon missions  are  short 
enough  to  not  require  a  Habitation  Module,  the  module  could  still  be  used  to  test  the

technology  for  future  missions  to  Mars.    Specific  details  of  the  HM  were  discussed  in 
Section  4.4.2.2.1,  but  from  the  Form/Function  Matrix  results  (see  Appendix  9.2.1), 
descriptions of its desired functions are given in Figure 32.

An  interesting  observation  is  the  number  of  different  forms  that  must  have  docking 
capabilities  with  the  HM.    Since  the  HM  module  will  be  docking  with  the  COV,  SM1, 
SM2, and MCM at separate  times during  the missions,  the design of all  these elements 
should  require  an  identical  interface.    Such  a  similarity  allows  for  more  flexibility  and 
adaptability  for  new  strategic  decisions.  For  example,  if  the  timeline  of  a  mission 
changes  and,  for  example,  docking  with  SM2  occurs  before  docking  with  the  Landers, 
the  system  can  still  function  adequately  during  logistic  constraints  because  of  the 
common  interface.   An option also exists  to use a portion of  the modular HM  to support 
a  crew  of  6  on  a  Moon  mission.    This  allows  the  functional  requirements  of  a  COV

      91              

 

supporting  a  crew  of  6  to  be  removed.    For  the  Moon  mission,  an  engine  burn  is 
required to attain lunar orbit.  However, a heat shield is still required for the HM because 
an  aerocapture maneuver will  take  place when  the HM  re-enters  LEO  on  the Extended 
Moon mission. 
 
It is important to mention that the HM has significantly different life support requirements 
for the Extended and Extended+ missions compared to the Short and Phobos missions.  
This is a result of different trajectories being used for those missions. 

5.2.1.4. Crew Service Module 
The  Crew  Service  Module  (SM)  is  the  form  that  provides  fuel  to  transport  the  crew 
traveling  in  either  the  COV  for  a  Moon  mission  or  MTV  (COV/HM)  for  a  Mars  mission.  
This  module  could  be  functionally  compared  to  the  Apollo  Service  Module.    Specific 
details  of  this module  were  presented  in  Section  4.4.2.2.1,  but  from  the  Form/Function 
Matrix  results  (see  Appendix  9.2.1)  a  Venn  diagram  of  functional  requirements  for  the 
SM was determined and shown in Figure 33.

It is evident that the pre-positioning requirement given by a Mars mission is not a critical 
technology for a Moon mission; however, the Moon could use pre-positioning to test the 
technology.    As  such,  two  similar  versions  of  an  SM  could  be  designed,  one  designed 
for  pre-positioning  use  and  the  other  for  conventional  propulsion.    The  first  Moon

mission  would  not  require  the  technology  and  would  thus  use  the  conventional 
propulsion  Service  Module.    However,  later  Moon  missions  could  use  pre-positioning 
technology  using  electric  propulsion  as  a  stepping-stone  for  the  future  Mars  mission 
requirements.    Furthermore,  the  amount  of  fuel  required  for  a  trans-lunar  injection  is 
significantly  different  than  the  amount  of  fuel  required  for  a  trans-Martian  injection. 
Taking  this  into  consideration  may  require  that  the  Moon  SM  and  the  Mars  SM  have 
slightly  different  forms.  The  extensibility  value  of  using  similar  structures  is  in  the 
manufacturing savings resulting in the use of legacy hardware.

5.2.1.5. Moon and Mars Landers 
A  Mars  Lander  (ML)  or  Lunar  Lander  (LL)  share  similar  functionality.    This  similarity  in 
functionality  is exploited to  incorporate commonality among the various Lander designs.  
Specific  details  of  the  Landers  are  discussed  in  Section  6.4.3.1.6.    The  Lander  was 
based  on  an  Apollo  style  Lander,  capable  of  transporting  a  crew  of  three  from  orbit  to 
the surface and back to orbit.  From the Form/Function Matrix results (Appendix 9.2.1) a 
Venn  diagram  of  functional  requirements  for  the  Lander  was  determined  and  shown  in

Figure 34: Functional requirements for a Moon/Mars Lander 

 
Consider  Figure  34.    For  comparison  purposes,  it  is  clear  that  common  functions  are 
shared.    When  common  functions  exist,  extensibility  will  benefit  the  overall  group  of 
missions  to  the Moon and Mars.   Considering Figure 34,  the Lander must dock with  the 
COV or the COV/HM in both lunar and Martian orbit.  As well, the Lander must deliver a 
crew of 6  to  the surface  for all of  the Mars missions and some of  the Moon missions.    If 
two  identical  Landers  are  chosen  instead  of  a  single,  larger  Lander,  the  impact  of  this 
decision  can  be  observed  by  evaluating  whether  or  not  the  new  option  satisfies  the 
functional  requirements.    If  all  of  the  functions  are  deemed  satisfied,  only  then was  the 
impact  of  the  decision  not  critical.    As  can  be  expected,  a  wide  range  of  requirements 
are made  for  the Landers, but many of  these  requirements are specified by only one of 
the seven missions, making  it difficult  to  justify changing  the baseline  form.    Indeed,  the 
Landers are a mission critical piece of hardware and must be highly  reliable. Therefore, 
when considering extensibility of such a device, it may be beneficial to target the Lander 
design for the most difficult landing mission, thereby ensuring a robust, if over-designed, 
form  for  the  other  missions.  This  has  the  effect  of  increasing  net  reliability  while  still 
maintaining an extensible form. The  idea of designing a non-optimal form now such that 
it  may  be  optimal  when  used  in  a  different  manner  or  location  stands  as  one  of  the 
cornerstones of extensibility. 

5.2.2 Form Conclusions 
When  this  method  of  comparison  of  using  Venn  diagrams  and  form/function  matrices 
was developed, it became apparent that many functions were required of each form.  At 
this  stage,  the  Venn  diagrams  do  not  capture  the  extreme  detail  required  of  an 
extensible Moon/Mars mission architecture.   However,  this  technique provides a  tool  for 
designing an extensible  transportation system.   Although many simplifying assumptions 
were  required  to  analyze  a  transportation  system  in  this  framework,  the  advantage  of 
this  method  is  seen  when  considering  the  impacts  of  a  decision  to  not  have  a  form 
perform  a  certain  function.    This  method  allows  these  decisions  to  be  traced.    The 
diagram  highlights  the  functions  that  were  not  captured  by  the  baseline  mission 
architecture.    Thus,  pains  must  be  taken  to  integrate  these  functionalities  into  the 
eventual  design  for  the  missions  that  require  them.  In  doing  so,  it  is  important  to 
recognize  a  fundamental  engineering  tension  that  exists  between  optimality  and 
extensibility.    A  form  that  is  designed  purely  with  optimality  in  mind  is  restricted  to  the 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      94              

 

point  design  for  which  it  was  originally  conceived.  This  makes  the  creative  use  and 
extension  of  such  technology  difficult.    On  the  other  hand,  a  form  designed  with  only 
extensibility  in  mind  will  become  “spread  thin,”  and  unable  to  perform  the  functions 
required  of  it  at  certain  stages  or  missions.    Thus,  a  compromise  must  be  made 
between these two extremes. 
 
When  designing  for  extensibility  to missions  involving  high  degrees  of  uncertainty,  care 
must  be  taken  to  ensure  that  the  current  mission  does  not  become  so  overburdened 
with  extraneous  requirements  that  it  is  prohibitively  expensive  to  function  as  planned.  
For  a  “point  design”  system,  it  is  a  possibility  that  some  functionality  designed  into  the 
system  may  never  be  used.    In  addition,  this  “point  design”  system  may  need  to  be 
entirely  re-designed  before  future  missions  take  place.    However,  when  designing  for 
extensibility  for  near-term  missions,  the  addition  of  an  extra  function  now  which  will 
likely be needed in future missions may decrease the cost of developing and testing that 
functionality  in  the  future,  thus  enabling  further  exploration  in  the  long  term  and 
increasing operational knowledge. 

5.3 Integrated Baseline 
The Presidential Directive on  the Moon, Mars and Beyond clearly sets  the Moon as  the 
first goal for today’s astronauts. The Moon is intended to be used as a testing ground for 
missions  to  Mars  and  Beyond.  In  the  absence  of  existing  infrastructure  on  the  Moon, 
SSLMs  may  be  expected  to  occur  in  the  near  future.  The  primary  purpose  of  these 
missions is to serve as lunar “scouts,” which will search primarily for location information, 
perhaps  regarding  possible  resources  that  may  be  exploited  on  the  Moon.  They 
possess  the  positive  attributes  of  being  relatively  low  in  cost  and  have  the  potential  for 
high  knowledge  return  given  that  they  land  in  unexplored  locations.  Prior  to  the  first 
SSLM,  unmanned  robotic  probes  may  be  sent  to  a  number  of  promising  landing  sites. 
Similarly,  lunar satellites could be constructed  to allow  for continuous  radio contact with 
the  far  side  of  the  Moon,  if  deemed  necessary  for  communications  with  these  probes. 
SSLMs  will  occur,  each  time  in  a  different  location,  until  a  decision  is  made  to  study 
particular  locations  in  more  depth  and  for  a  longer  period  of  time.  Future  Short  Moon 
missions  may  include  testing  of  preliminary  rover  hardware,  testing  of  new  space-suit 
concepts,  and  gradual  extensions  of  the  life-support  capabilities  of  possibly  up  to  1-2 
weeks.  Once  sufficient  experience  with  lunar  operations  has  been  established  through 
the SSLMs, MSLM missions may be launched.

Figure 35: Flow diagram describing elements of extensibility in integrated baseline 
 
The  primary  purpose  of  MSLMs  is  to  generate  scientific  knowledge  and  to  establish 
non-permanent  infrastructure  on  the  Moon.  These  missions  will  be  aimed  at  scientific 
exploration  and  resource  evaluation  of  promising  sites  found  during  the  Short  Stay 
Lunar Missions.  These missions  are  larger  in  scale  than  the  SSLMs,  and  they  possess 
the ability  to carry more equipment.   As such, astronauts participating  in  these missions 
will  be  tasked  with  operating  larger  scale  scientific  apparatus  and  the  scientific 
precursors  to  the  first  in-situ propellant production  facilities. These will be small scale at 
first,  serving  primarily  as  technology  demonstrators,  but  may  be  scaled  up  in  future 
missions to allow for some basic functionality. Included with Medium Moon missions will 
be  an  unpressurized  rover,  which  is  designed  to  carry  astronauts  to  locations  beyond 
their operational walking radius. These rovers may initially be tested on SSLMs, and will 
probably initially be restricted to traveling distances that astronauts can safely walk back 
from.    With  sufficient  experience  gained  by  using  this  rover  system,  the  range  of  the 
rovers may  be  extended. MSLMs  will  occur  in  a  limited  range  of  locations  and multiple 
missions  may  be  sent  to  the  same  location.  These  missions  will  occur  until  a  primary 
site  is  chosen  for  a  future  semi-permanent  lunar  base.  MSLMs  are  still  limited  by  the 
fact  that  astronauts  may  only  stay  on  the  lunar  surface  for  limited  periods  of  time  and 
the  fact  that most mass utilized will come  from Earth.  In general,  these missions will not 
have  the  capability  to  survive  throughout  the  lunar  night,  although  later  MSLMs  may 
wish to gear some activities towards this kind of sustenance.

The  next  step  beyond  the  MSLMs  is  dependant  on  the  degree  to  which  in-situ  lunar 
resources may be used. If these resources are present, it may be desirable to conduct a 
series of Extended Stay Lunar Missions  (ESLMs) designed  to set up a semi-permanent 
lunar  base  and  to  generate  the  capability  to  search  the  far  side  of  the  Moon  in  more 
detail.  This  mission  would  be  primarily  aimed  at  allowing  more  humans  to  live  on  the 
lunar  surface  for  increasingly  long  amounts  of  time.  This  report  assumes  that  such 
resources  are  present  and  usable.  In  the  event  that  in-situ  resource  production  is  not 
directly  feasible, such a  long-term base on  the Moon would  require a significant supply-
chain  from  the  Earth.  The  requirement  that  this  supply  chain  imposes  is  not  directly  in 
line  with  overall  mission  sustainability.  Thus,  if  in-situ  resources  are  not  available,  the 
ESLMs may  not  be  launched.  Instead, more MSLMs may  be  carried  out  to  prepare  for 
an eventual Martian Short Stay Mission. 
 
The  primary  purpose  of  ESLMs  is  for  this  architectural  design  to  align  with  the 
President’s  declaration  that  more  humans  will  remain  on  the  Moon  for  increasing 
lengths  of  time. These missions will  be  aimed  at  establishing  a  semi-permanent  habitat 
with  at  least  six  astronauts  on  the  lunar  surface where  astronauts may  gain  experience 
in living in non-Earth environments for long periods of time. Since these missions will be 
aimed at  the construction of a habitat, some pre-positioning will  take place by necessity 
through  resupply  from  unmanned  probes  and  the  use  of  cargo  from  previous  Moon 
missions.  Therefore,  this  suite  of  missions  will  allow  for  the  buildup  of  accurate  pre-
positioning  operational  knowledge.  If  the  targeting  is  not  accurate  on  the  first  few 
attempts,  rovers  from  the MSLMs  will  be  available  to  allow  the  astronauts  to  reach  the 
landing  site.  In  the  worst-case  scenario,  they  may  return  home  as  is  done  in  a  MSLM. 
Astronauts  participating  in  these  missions  will  be  tasked  with  operating  larger-scale  in-
situ  propellant  production  facilities.  The  eventual  goal  will  be  to  create  a  largely  self-
sustained  semi-permanent  base.  Some  potential  capabilities  to  be  added  include  a 
rescue vehicle stored  in an easily accessible  location so  that astronauts may escape  to 
Earth  in  case  of  unforeseen  circumstances.  Included  with  ESLMs  will  be  habitat 
modules  in which astronauts may  live for  increasing  lengths of time.  ESLMs will  initially 
occur only  in one  location. These missions will  likely occur until  the  first Mars mission  is 
launched,  at  which  point  the  semi-permanent  base may  be  turned  over  to  international 
partners  or  the  commercial  sector  for  further  development.    These  missions  will  have 
the  capability  to  survive  through  the  lunar  night,  and  will  therefore  require  an 
independent  source  of  power  to  be  used  during  the  lunar  night.  The  next  step  beyond 
the ESLMs is the Martian Short Stay set of missions. These will be the first time humans 
will  travel  beyond  Earth’s  gravitational  sphere  of  influence  with  respect  to  the  Earth-
Moon system. 
 
The  primary  purpose  of  the Martian Short Stay  is  to  demonstrate  the  ability  of mankind 
to  survive  on  the  surface  of Mars.    These missions  nominally  require  pre-positioning  of 
cargo  on  the  Martian  surface,  although  the  first  such  mission  may  not  utilize  this 
capability  simply  because  of  the  complexity  of  pre-positioning  maneuvers.  If  pre-
positioning  has  already  been  successfully  tested during Moon missions,  the  technology 
used may be used on missions  to Mars. Prior  to  the  first Short Stay mission, unmanned 
robotic  probes may  be  sent  to  a  number  of  promising  landing  sites.  These  probes may 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      97              

 

also  be  used  to  practice  the  accuracy  of  pre-positioning  technology.  Like  an  ESLM, 
Mars missions  utilize  habitat modules.  In  the  event  that  no  in-situ  resources  exist  to  be 
exploited on the Moon, the habitat capability must be developed for this mission with no 
in-situ resources utilization knowledge  to be extended  from a previous mission. Like  the 
MSLM,  Short  Stay  missions  will  possess  unpressurized  rovers  that  may  be  used  to 
explore  over  a  relatively  large  range.  They  will  also  be  used  to  test  and  verify  in-situ 
resource production and utilization facilities for use on Mars. 
 
Short Stay missions will  occur,  usually  in  different  locations,  until  a  decision  is made  to 
study  particular  locations  in more  depth  and  for  a  longer  period  of  time. Although Short 
Stay  missions  will  likely  occur  more  than  once,  the  mass  and  energy  requirements  to 
perform  these  missions  will  moderate  the  number  of  Short  Stay  missions  compared  to 
the number of Short Stay Lunar Missions.   Rather, upon  finding an  ideal  long-term site, 
Martian  exploration  may  continue  with  longer  term,  shorter-transfer  missions  to 
minimize  the  effect  of microgravity  and  to  take  advantage  of  the  resources  expected  to 
be  found on Mars. The major  limitations of  the Short Mars missions are  imposed by  the 
mass  required  to  support  life  on  Mars  and  in  transit  for  such  a  long  time.    Any 
opportunity  to  reduce mass  discovered  during  lunar mission  operations  would  likely  be 
implemented in this mission.  For example, if in-situ propellant could be produced on the 
Moon,  it  could  significantly  reduce  the  mass  required  to  get  to  Mars,  even  if  that 
propellant  required  a  detour  to  the Moon.    Similarly,  weight  concerns  impose  an  upper 
limit  on  the  number  of  samples  that may  be  brought  back  to Earth.   Future Short Moon 
missions  may  include  testing  of  longer-term  habitation  facilities,  testing  of  new  space-
suit  concepts,  and  alternative  propulsion  and  in-situ  propellant  production  concepts. 
Once  sufficient  experience  with  Martian  operations  has  been  established,  Extended 
Stay, and Extended Stay + Infrastructure missions may occur.  
 
The  primary  purpose  of  Extended  Stay  and  Extended  Stay  +  Infrastructure missions  is 
to demonstrate  the ability of mankind  to survive on  the surface of Mars  for an  increased 
duration. In the case of Extended Stay + Infrastructure missions, humans will establish a 
semi-permanent  infrastructure  on Mars  to  be  used  for  science,  operations  research,  or 
as  a  testbed  for  the  next  destination.  These  missions  nominally  require  pre-positioning 
of  cargo  on  the Martian  surface,  and  therefore  require  the  performance  of  a  successful 
Short  Stay  Mission  to  ensure  that  pre-positioning  technology  is  adequately  developed. 
Prior  to  the  first  Extended  Stay  mission,  Short  Stay  missions  will  have  identified 
promising  resource  excavation  sites,  and  resource  processing  activities.  One  of  the 
purposes  of  an  Extended  Stay  mission  is  to  take  advantage  of  these  capabilities  for 
refueling,  for  life-support and agriculture, and  to explore Mars  in a more comprehensive 
manner  over  a  longer  period  of  time  than  is  possible  with  a  Short  Stay  mission.  An 
Extended  Stay  +  Infrastructure  mission  will  have  the  capability  to  be  self-sustained 
based  upon  in-situ  resource  production,  thus  reducing  mass  in  LEO  as  much  as 
possible.  To  this  end,  the  transit  characteristics  of  an  Extended  Stay  +  Infrastructure 
mission  will  evolve  from  a  MOR  class  mission  to  a  Mars  Direct  mission.  If  in-situ 
production  is  not  available,  Extended  Stay  +  Infrastructure  mission  will  likely  not  occur 
because  of  the  difficulties  in  maintaining  a  Martian  supply  chain  from  Earth.  Like  an 
ESLM mission, all Mars missions utilize surface habitation modules. Extended Stay and

Extended  Stay  +  Infrastructure missions will  take  advantage  of  knowledge  gained  from 
habitat  technology used  for  the Short Stay missions. Extended Stay and Extended Stay 
+  Infrastructure  missions  will  possess  upgraded  rovers  that  may  be  used  to  explore  a 
larger  surface  area.  These  rovers  may  be  pressurized  in  the  Extended  Stay  missions 
and will almost  certainly be pressurized  in  the Extended Stay +  Infrastructure missions. 
This  represents  extensibility  from  the  ESLM.  Extended  Stay  +  Infrastructure  missions 
will make use of  inflatable  structures and other  innovative  semi-permanent  construction 
materials  in  the  establishment  of  a  Martian  base.  Extended  Stay  and  Extended  Stay+ 
missions will occur confined  to valuable  locations. These  locations will often be dictated 
by  those  that  are  richest  in  exploitable  resources  and  those  that  promise  to  yield  the 
greatest knowledge returns.  
 
Upon  successful  completion  of  Extended+ missions,  NASA  will  have  gained  significant 
experience  in  the  area  of manned  space  exploration  beyond  LEO.  This  experience  will 
help  further  exploration  throughout  the  solar  system.  A  mission  to  Phobos  is  just  one 
way  to start  this expansion. The primary purpose of Phobos missions  is  to demonstrate 
extensibility  on multiple  levels.  Beyond  the Martian  system,  there  are  three  places  that 
NASA may choose to explore. These include:  
 

•  The inner solar-system 
•  The asteroid belt 
•  The moons of the outer solar system 

 
For  reasons  previously  mentioned,  a  pre-Short  Stay  mission  to  Phobos  is  an  ideal 
technology  demonstrator  for  the  destinations  listed  above.  Phobos  missions  may  be 
conducted  at  any  time  within  the  baseline  framework.  The  suggested  time  for  the 
mission  is  before  Short  Stay  Mars  missions,  when  resources  are  not  yet  heavily 
invested  in  a  semi-permanent  Martian  base.  This  will  give  NASA  operation  experience 
in  navigating  to  Mars  orbit,  similar  to  how  Apollo  8  achieved  lunar  orbit  before  the 
landing of Apollo 11. 
 
Although this report only focuses on the Moon and on Mars as  locations to be explored, 
the  new  NASA  vision  unequivocally  states  that  the  program  does  not  end  there. 
Exploration is an activity that will never cease and the potential to educate and to inspire 
from  this  exploration  will  never  run  dry.  Although  the  next  location  to  be  visited  by 
human  astronauts  is  not  certain,  there  is  no  shortage  of  secrets  to  be  unlocked  and 
mysteries  to  be  discovered.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  the  President’s  vision  is  entitled 
Moon, Mars and Beyond, for Beyond is the ultimate destination of mankind.

6. Analysis and Trade Studies 

 

6.1 Introduction 
The  ultimate  goal  of  the  design  process  is  to  create  an  architecture  that  is  flexible  and 
robust  in  the  face  of  change.  Having  identified  sources  of  commonality  between  the 
Moon  and  Mars,  and  translated  this  commonality  to  operational  and  formal  attributes, 
the  next  step  is  to  create  a  flexible  architecture.    Final  decisions  regarding  the 
architecture will depend on key trades identified during commonality mapping.  Because 
we  hope  to  create  an  architecture  using  a  long-term  view  of  the  system  life-cycle, 
however, tools that capture the value of flexibility and robustness will be needed. 
 
This section presents three possible tools for such analysis:  
 

•  Analytic-Deliberative Process, through the Analytic-Hierarchy Process 
•  Multiatribute Utility theory, implemented through Decision Analysis  
•  Real Options Analysis 
It  then  reviews  architectural  trades  that  we  have  identified  as  critical  to  sustainable 
exploration, and architectural commonality. 

6.2 Decision Analysis Using Multiattribute Utility Theory 
One  defining  attribute  of  a  sustainable  system  is  a  long  expected  life-cycle.    Thus, 
predicting  the  circumstances  under  which  the  system  will  operate  throughout  its  life 
cycle  becomes  difficult  as  uncertainty  increases  with  time.  Such  systems  must  also 
incorporate  subsystems  that  operate  throughout  the  architectural  domain,  from  the 
mechanical to the political, to the commercial. Again, significant uncertainty is present in 
the system’s operating environment. As a  result,  the system must be prepared  to adapt 
to  unexpected  situations  without  significantly  reducing  the  system’s  operational  utility.  
Space systems must balance budget constraints and risk. The difficulty of maintaining a 
delicate balance has resulted in a low mission success rates. 
 
This  section  suggests  a way  to  choose  a  flexible  architecture  that will  adapt  to  different 
scenarios,  thereby  helping  the  system  to  accommodate  to  changing  environmental 
conditions  without  significantly  compromising  performance.  Two  approaches  are 
available;  either  a  closed  “best  design”  that  attempts  to  take  into  account  each  and 
every  possible  change,  or  a  strategy  that  will  change  and  evolve  to  accommodate  the 
unforeseen.  The  former  option  is  restricted  to  current  projections  of  future  events, 
whereas  the  latter  option  is  dynamic  and  adaptable  in  the  face  of  uncertainty.  This 
report  proposes  the  latter  approach  as  a  way  to  adapt  to  changing  environmental 
conditions.    That  is,  a  baseline  option  is  chosen  now,  while  preserving  the  widest 
possible  options  for  the  future.  Decisions,  which  would  otherwise  have  to  be  made  at 
the  outset,  are  delayed  such  that,  when  the  final  choice  is  required,  it  is  made  in  an 
environment of decreased uncertainty. 
 
The bulk of  this  report  focuses on  the creation of a baseline strategy  to go  to  the Moon, 
to  Mars  and  beyond.  This  baseline  was  designed  with  a  set  of  implicit  assumptions, 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      100              

 

regarding  the  state  of  the  system’s  operating  environment  through  time.  Ideally,  the 
baseline  is  the strategy  that  is most  likely  to succeed given present knowledge of  future 
events. 
 
An  alternative  set  of  extreme  environmental  changes  that  would  impact  the  baseline 
design  (either  positively  or  negatively)  was  identified  through  brainstorming.    These 
changes  constitute  scenario  descriptions.  A  set  of  responses  to  those  scenario 
descriptions  was  then  developed.  These  responses  constitute  alternative  paths  that 
may be  taken  in designing  the system. Using  this  framework, one may also  think of  the 
baseline design as a response to the most likely scenario.  The scenarios also provide a 
means  to  identify  a  possible  set  of  architectural  trades  or  options.    These  critical  trade 
decisions  are  analyzed  further.  In  doing  this  selection,  the  amplitude  of  the  field  to  be 
explored  was  severely  cropped  in  an  effort  to  perform  a  somewhat  deeper  analysis  on 
these  interesting  features  of  the  trade  space.  If  all  of  these  decisions  were  to  be made 
at  the  outset,  based  only  on  current  understanding  of  future  events,  there  is  a  high 
likelihood  that  these  decisions  would  not  be  the  best  choices  in  the  future.  There  is 
almost always more  information  that becomes available  through  time  that has  the effect 
of changing the environment under which the system must operate. Thus, it is beneficial 
to delay decisions to allow for a better, more informed decision to be made later. 
 
All  potential  architectures  can  be  fully  described  by  a  vector  of  the  different  decisions 
that  have  to  be  taken  in  order  to  implement  it.  The meaning  of  the word  architecture  in 
this  case  is  not  restricted  to  the  physical  form  of  the  objects.    A  space  architecture 
includes  forms,  transit points, budget, policy, etc.  It  is possible  to apply Utility Theory  to 
analyze each of these vectors in the context of scenarios and associated trades.  
 
In  doing  so,  one  must  first  explore  how  the  present  baseline  reacts  to  a  change  in  the 
operating  environment,  and  how  appropriate  decisions  taken  at  points  throughout  the 
system’s  life-cycle  could  buy  some  insurance  against  negative  scenarios,  or  increased 
payoffs in case of positives ones. An investment increase will reduce the expected utility, 
while  potentially  reducing  risk  by  neutralizing  negative  outcomes.  Similarly,  one  could 
increase  the  payoffs  by  taking  real  advantage  of  optimistic  outcomes.  This  analysis  is 
based on Real Options theory. The problem of acquiring utility is complex; however, and 
in its complexity lays its value. The utility is not an absolute number; rather it is a scaled 
numerical  representation  that  reflects  a  synthesis  of  the  opinions  of  a  group  of 
stakeholders  around  an  issue.  The  tool  proposed  to  make  this  synthesis  is  called  the 
Analytical  Deliberative  Process.  This  tool  is  a  formal  framework  that  helps  a  group  of 
people  to  discuss  a  set  of  opposing  measures  and  to  synthesize  their  potentially 
contradictory  opinions.  In  doing  so,  utility  values  may  be  determined  such  that  the 
analysis  can  proceed.  However,  one  important  point  should  be  clarified.  This  utility 
number  is  an  artificial  creation.  It  is  not  a  “silver  bullet”.  Rather,  it  expresses  a  set  of 
opinions,  many  of  which  may  be  subject  to  change  through  time.  Computers  are  often 
used  to  calculate  these  values  based  upon  subjective  input,  and  it  is  therefore  a 
temptation  to  treat  these  utilities  as  incontrovertible  data,  although  they  are  subjective 
assessments of individuals’ opinions.

By  assessing  the  different  performance  metrics  that  each  of  the  architecture  vectors 
presents,  it  would  be  possible  to  get  a measure  of  the  net  utility  that  each  architecture 
holds for the stakeholders. In order to select the architecture that will provide the highest 
expected utility, a method using Decision Analysis is proposed.  
 
As  time  passes,  some  decision  points  are  encountered.  Similarly,  there  are  points  in 
time  in  which  the  architecture’s  operation  depends  on  some  element  of  chance.  Some 
of  these  chance  points  may  have  been  predicted  through  previous  analyses,  and  thus 
the baseline would  remain unchanged.   Still, others may not have been anticipated and 
an  out-of-baseline  approach  might  be  necessary.  It  is  crucial  to  understand  each  of 
these  possible  branching  points,  and  to  study  them  through  a  conceptual  scenario 
analysis, such as  the one described above,  in order  to be able  to apply  the  real options 
approach.    The  approach  provides  a  thoughtful  way  to  decide  where,  when,  and  how 
much to pay for risk reduction and benefit magnification.  

6.2.1 Tools 
In order to proceed, three tools are proposed: 
 

•  Analytic-Deliberative Process, through the Analytic-Hierarchy Process 
•  Multiattribute Utility theory, implemented through Decision Analysis  
•  Real Options Analysis 

 
Both  tools  help  to  understand  how  to  deal  with  a  complex  set  of  options  and 
requirements, which are sometimes in conflict. 

6.2.1.1 The Analytic-Deliberative Process 
This  is  a  rigorous  and  replicable  method  that  provides  a  protocol,  under  which  a 
community of “experts” may arrive at an answer  to a  factual question. This concept of a 
consultative  body  of  experts,  which  assigns  these  utility  values,  is  important,  since  it 
allows  for  the  incorporation  of  viewpoints  ranging  from  members  of  the  technical 
community to members of the political community to the public at large. 
 
The process uses the following steps:  
 

1. Decompose the problem into a hierarchy:  
All the different requirements have to be sorted into a hierarchy.  
In  order  to  calculate  the  value  of  a  certain  approach,  several  higher-level  Impact 
categories are devised. They may or may not be independent, in the sense that a 
change  in  any  of  them  may  affect  others.  Each  of  these  impact  categories 
includes several objectives that use performance metrics in order to be measured. 
Some of  these performance metrics will be  formulas, and will have exact  values, 
whereas  others  will  be  more  subjective,  and  be  measured  in  ranges.  In  each 
case,  a  number  of  utility  levels  are  chosen.  This  yields  a  tree-like  structure  in 
which the main trunk depicts the utility value. 

 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      102              

 

2. Experts  rate  the  importance  of  the  different  levels  and  state  their preferences. They 
are asked  to make pairwise  comparisons, starting  from  the utility  levels on  the  lower 
branches of the tree. 
 
3.  In  order  to  synthesize  the  results,  these  previous  pairwise  comparisons  are  used  to 
fill  the  so-called Ranking matrices.  The  eigenvalues  of  these matrices  are  the weights 
that the experts have chosen for the different branches that feed into the utility values. 
 
4.  To  evaluate  the  consistency  of  a  judgment,  a  confidence  index  is  calculated.  This 
index assesses the coherency with which the experts have made their judgments. This 
index helps to build confidence on the coherence of the opinions expressed.  

 

The  same  approach  is  used  to  generate weights  for  the different branches of  the  tree: 
performance  measures  feed  an  objective,  objectives  feed  an  impact  category  and, 
finally, impact categories feed into the utility value. 

 
Using  these  methods,  experts  may  determine  how  to  rate  the  different  approaches. 
Utility  values  may  be  calculated  using  some  metric,  such  as  mass  to  be  launched  to 
LEO,  or  a  subjective  measure,  such  as  the  desired  level  of  extensibility  through  a 
constructed range scale. 

6.2.1.2 Decision Analysis Theory 
Decision  Analysis  Theory  is  a  structured  way  to  rank  the  decision  options  available  to 
the  decision  maker.  It  enumerates  the  immediate  and  later  choices  available, 
characterizes  uncertainty,  quantifies  their  desirability,  and  provides  rules  to  help  the 
decision maker to choose the “best” alternative. 
 
Choices  to  be  made,  and  chances  to  be  taken  are  organized  in  a  tree-like  hierarchy, 
with  the  immediate  choice  at  the  trunk  of  the  tree,  and  the  posterior  ones  following  in 
some sort of order (e.g. chronologically). 
 
At  each  position where  a  chance  event  is  encountered,  there  is  a  chance  node,  and  at 
each position where a decision has to be taken, a decision node is assigned.

Figure 36: Decision analysis tree.   
Decision  nodes  are  drawn  as  squares,  and  chance  nodes  are  drawn  as  circles.    In  this  example, 
the  decision  maker  will  choose  Alternative  A  because  it  expected  utility  is  0.72,  which  is  higher 
than the utility of Alternative B (0.22).  
 
In  order  to  evaluate  the  desirability  of  each  option,  a  certain  utility  is  assigned  to  each 
final  outcome  of  the  tree  as  shown  in  Figure  36.  This  utility  function  could  be  an 
absolute  number,  but  the  previously  explained  Analytic  Deliberative  process  can  be 
used  to assign  these utilities. Similarly, at each chance point, probabilities are assigned 
to  each  possible  outcome.  These  probabilities  could  either  be  assigned  by  a  complete 
assessment of the probabilities, or by asking experts about the likelihood of the different 
events  and  applying  the  Analytic  Deliberative  process  once  again.  Taking  into  account 
these utilities and probabilities,  it  is possible  to  travel backwards  in  the  tree, and  thus  to 
calculate expected utilities at each chance node. 

6.2.2.1 An Example Employing the Analytic-Deliberative Process 
A short example follows, using a decision node that is defined by the option of using  
EM-L1  as  a  transit  point  on  the  way  to  the  Moon.  This  example  also  considers  the 
probability  of  having  water  on  the  lunar  South  Pole.  The  utility  of  including  the  fuel 
necessary to transit through EM-L1, and then to construct a lunar base, is the calculated. 
The  numbers  and  opinions  expressed  in  this  example  are  not  rigorous.  Rather,  they 
have  been  used  to  show  how  a  method  of  this  kind  could  be  used,  even  when 
exhaustive  analysis  and  complete  studies  of  the  involved  probabilities  have  not  been 
done.  The  primary  purpose  of  this  example  is  to  show  the  mechanics  involved  in  the 
decision-making process. 
 
The following impact categories have been arbitrarily chosen: 
1.  Cost  
2.  Schedule fulfillment

It  is  important  to  note  that  while  it  would  be  possible  to  obtain  firm  data  for  some  of 
these performance measures, the lack of unequivocal data does not hinder the analysis. 
In any case, the result will be a mix of opinions and engineering calculus that reflect the

Process.

Thus,  the  above  tree may  be  used  to  determine what  decisions  need  be made  at what 
points.  This  method  is  not  a  “silver  bullet”  solution.  Rather,  it  proposes  a  formal 
framework  for  analysis,  argue  about  options,  and  quantify  the  sensitivity  to  factors.  A 
diverse  set  of  variables  also  helps  to  take  into  account  the  sometimes-contradictory 
opinion of a group of stakeholders.

6.3 Real Options Analysis 
Real Options  is  a method  to  value  flexibility  in  system  design.  It  evaluates  the  costs  of 
the  enabling  decisions  taken  today  to  perform  certain  functions  in  the  future.  Since 
these decisions are enablers, they are a necessary condition. In addition, a trigger must 
act in the future to decide whether to exercise the option or not. In some sense, creating 
a  real  option  is  buying  insurance.  Thus,  a  price  is  paid,  whether  or  not  this  option  is 
exercised. Once  this  price  is  paid,  one  has  the  right,  but  not  the  obligation,  to  exercise 
the option. 
 
In  the  example  explained  above,  the  option  bought  will  be  the  ability  to  use  L1.  Its 
benefits  are  realizable  only  if  a  decision  is made  to  land  on  the  South  Pole.  To  assess 
the cost of the option, the following exercise may be executed.  
 
First,  compare  the  utilities  using  the  Decision  Analysis  tree,  assuming  that  the  mission 
path  never  lands  on  the  South  Pole.  As  shown  in  Table  7,  the  expected  utilities  are 
0.382  for having  the ability  to go  to L1 and 0.417  for not having  that ability.  In  this case, 
the choice of L1 ability is not ideal, since the polar opportunity is never exploited. 
 

Table 7: Expected utilities from the Decision Analysis tree for the L1 capability decision

0.574 
0.417 

Able to go to L1 
Not able to go to L1 

0.382 
0.417 

 
On  the  other  hand,  when  a  decision  is made  to  go  to  the  South  Pole,  a  utility  of  0.417 
with L1 capability is traded with a potential utility of 0.574 without L1 capability. 
 
Given  the  decision  is  not  made  to  go  to  L1,  the  cost  of  the  real  option  is  therefore  the 
difference between  the utility  that  the option  is not  taken  (0.417) and  the utility of  taking 
the option erroneously (0.382). Thus  the cost of  the option  is a utility of 0.035. Similarly, 
the  potential  benefit  of  taking  this  option  is  0.157.  In  this  conceptual  situation,  the 
potential  reward  is  significantly  larger  than  the  potential  cost,  indicating  that  a  decision 
should be made to utilize L1. 

6.3.1 Example: L1 Options 
Another  way  to  frame  the  decision  of  using  L1  to  access  the  Moon  involves  using  the 
notion  of  “expected  mass”  rather  than  utility.  The  following  example  uses  real  options 
thinking to value the benefit of creating a system that has the option to use L1 to explore 
the Moon.  
 
Background and assumptions: 
An exploration system starting in LEO is assumed to be composed of both a COV and a 
Lunar Lander. Two operational architectures are considered: 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      108              

 

 

1.)  LOR:  The  COV  and  Lander  enter  lunar  orbit.  The  Lander  descends  and 
ascends to and from lunar orbit. 
2.) L1: The COV enters L1  orbit,  the Lander descends and ascends  to  the Moon 
from L1. 

 
If continuous access to the poles is desired together with continuous free return (a likely 
need  if  a  lunar  base  is  to  be  built  at  the  poles),  then  the  system  architectures  present 
two possibilities: 
 

1.) Use of L1, with a Lander that can descend and ascend to and from L1 
2.) Use of LOR, with a plane change burn once in lunar equatorial orbit 

 
The  plane-change  burn  at  the  Moon  requires  considerable  ∆V  and  makes  the  L1 
options more appealing.  
 
Under what circumstances would  it be beneficial  to have  the option access L1? Framed 
as  a  real  option,  one  can  examine  the mass  savings  and  penalties  from  LEO  for  using 
L1  compared  to  the  base  case  in  which  the  equator  is  accessed.  Decision  analysis  is 
used  here,  although  more  complicated  modeling  techniques  could  also  be  used  to 
increase the accuracy of the valuation. 
 
If  a  mission  to  the  Moon  targets  the  equatorial  region,  it  is  clear  that  lunar  orbit  is  the 
best location from which to descend. A mission to the lunar equatorial region, employing 
a Lander from L1 requires about 11% more ∆v than from lunar orbit. If lunar pole access 
is  required,  however,  this  architecture  demands  a  plane  change  in  lunar  orbit,  resulting 
in extra mass in LEO compared to the base case. Conversely,  if the pole does not need 
to be accessed and  the Lander  is equipped with L1  capability,  the architecture  requires 
extra mass in LEO compared to the base case. 
 
Assuming that mass in LEO is a surrogate for cost, we can calculate the expected mass 
of a mission to the Moon, based on the probability of a decision to access the poles.  
 
Expected Mass (EM):  
 
EM = (Mass in LEO for Pole Access)*P + (Mass in LEO for no Pole Access)*(1-P) 
 
where P is equal to the probability that the pole will be accessed for a given mission.

Figure 38: Decision tree for L1 capability example 

 
Then,  sensitivity  analysis  can  be  used  to  determine  where  the  value  of  the  option, 
exceeds  that of  the base case. The sensitivity analysis reveals  that the option  to use L1 
becomes  more  valuable  (less  costly)  than  the  base-case  if  there  is  more  than  a  30% 
chance that the poles will need to be accessed during the system’s life-cycle.

Of  course,  a  number  of  other  factors  will  affect  the  decision-making  process.  The 
number of missions to each location is an important factor  in determining mass savings. 
Also, this analysis does not consider the fact that mass savings, like cost, might need to 
be “discounted” over time. 
 
Still,  options  valuation  presents  a  powerful  method  to  quantitatively  justify  a  decision 
that  is  currently  sub-optimal,  but  may  increase  in  optimality  as  circumstances  change.

By  framing  the  L1  decision  as  a  real  option,  system  architects  can  design  flexibility  into 
the architecture and produce a more sustainable system. 

6.3.2 Example: Staged vs. Cycler Transportation System Design 
Real  options  can  be  used  to  evaluate  commonality  in  the  design  of  the  transportation 
system  for  LEO  to  beyond.  The  two  major  transportation  architectural  designs  for  the 
transfer  to  the  Moon  and  Mars  are  a  staged  and  a  cycler  system.  Traditional  design 
methodologies  would  evaluate  both  systems,  but  would  eventually  choose  only  one 
design  for  the  transportation  system.  Instead  of  following  a  traditional  approach,  this 
section  will  describe  how  the  design  of  the  space  transportation  system  could  be 
evaluated  as  a  real  option  and  how  commonality  can  exist  between  the  designs  of 
transportation systems with different destinations. 
 
A  staged  system  is  similar  to  the  design  of  Apollo where  stages were  used  to  get  from 
LEO  to  lunar  orbit  and  then  from  lunar  orbit  back  to  Earth.  In  the  staged  architecture, 
each  stage  is  discarded  once  it  has  been  used;  the  use  of  stages  in  the  transportation 
design  maximizes  the  efficiency  of  the  rocket  equation  because  the  design  eliminates 
any dead weight that would have to be carried throughout the mission. 
 
A cycler architecture differs from the staged architecture in that a cycler architecture has 
no  stages,  consequently  carrying  around  dead  weight.  One  stage  provides  the  ∆v  for 
the entire mission. Where a staged design would have  two or more sets of engines and 
fuel  tanks,  the  cycler  has  only  one  set  of  engines  and  fuel  tanks.  The  other  main 
difference  is that the cycler  is reusable after  it re-enters Earth orbit. A common example 
of  a  cycler  is  the  modern  automobile.  Between  destinations  the  physical  form  of  a  car 
doesn’t change except  for  fuel. From a high-level perspective,  the cycler design has  the 
advantage  over  the  staged  design  because  it  can  be  reused  from  mission  to  mission, 
while the expendable, staged architecture would have to be rebuilt for each mission. 
 
In  order  to  determine  which  design  approach  to  take  in  the  development  of  the 
transportation system, a sample Mars mission was used as a baseline and the minimum 
required  mass  in  LEO  was  calculated.  The  characteristics  of  the  sample  Mars  mission 
can  be  found  in  Table  8.  The  total  mass  required  at  LEO  for  the  staged  mission  is 
roughly one-fourth of  the cycler architecture mass. This  result  is partially due  to  the  fact 
that the cycler has to carry around additional dead weight on the return trip that requires 
significant additional fuel for the return trip, which in turn leads to the need for increased 
fuel  for  the  outbound  trip.  The most  likely main  reason  for  the  large mass  difference  is 
because  the  staged  architecture  is  not  required  to  reestablish  Earth  orbit  on  the  return 
trip  and  therefore  the  staged  design  does  not  have  to  carry  the  additional  fuel mass  to 
perform  a  re-orbit  burn.  Because  of  the  reusable  nature  of  the  cycler,  the  vehicle must 
perform  an  additional  burn  in  order  to  reestablish  Earth  orbit.  The  additional  burn  to 
reestablish  Earth  orbit  is  about  5  km/s  and  results  in  a  significant mass  increase  in  the 
amount of fuel required by the cycler.

Since the required burn to reestablish Earth orbit is a significant constraint on the design 
of  the  cycler,  one  must  consider  whether  the  burn  at  the  Earth  is  truly  required.  The 
cycler  is  required  to  re-enter Earth orbit, but  the cycler  is not  required  to perform a burn 
in  order  to  reestablish  Earth  orbit.  It  could  be  possible  for  the  cycler  to  perform  some 
form  of  aero-braking  in  order  to  minimize  or  possibly  eliminate  the  need  for  a  burn  to 
establish Earth orbit.  
 
After  reevaluating  the  required  mass  at  LEO  for  the  cycler  assuming  the  use  of 
aerobraking,  the  staged  architecture  is  preferred  over  the  cycler  architecture. However, 
the  mass  required  at  LEO  for  the  cycler  architecture  has  been  reduced  by  a  factor  of 
three.  The  use  of  aerobraking  did  not  change  the  preference  of  the  staged  over  the 
cycler  architecture,  although  it  significantly  improved  the  required  initial  cycler  mass 
LEO. The results of the case in which aerobraking was performed can be found in Table 
9.

Perhaps,  the  requirement  of  a  burn was  not  the  deciding  factor  in  the mass  difference.  
Instead,  one  might  consider  the  inefficiencies  of  the  mass  fraction.  How  would  the 
required mass  at  LEO  change  if  the  return  fuel  could  be  pre-positioned  at  the Moon  or 
Mars?  In  order  to  compare  both  transportation  designs  on  an  equal  level,  pre-
positioning must be applied  to both  the staged and cycler  transportation designs.  In  the 
case  of  pre-positioning  for  the  staged  architecture,  the  transfer  vehicle  would  only  be 
required  to carry  the  first stage on  the outgoing  leg.  It could  then drop off  the  first stage 
and  pick-up  the  second  stage  for  the  return  flight  home.  In  the  case  of  the  cycler,  the 
fuel  for  the  return  flight  home  could  be  provided  at  the  final  destination,  but  instead  of 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      112              

 

dropping  a  stage  like  the  staged  architecture,  the  cycler  would  simply  refuel  using  the 
pre-positioned  fuel  provided  at  the  destination.  The  design  of  the  cycler  would  require 
that  the  fuel  stage  be  sized  accordingly  to  accommodate  the  leg  of  the  trip  which 
required  the  largest  fuel mass.  The  design  choice  would  result  in  either  the  inbound  or 
outbound  trip with  a  sub-optimal  use  of  the mass  fraction  equation.  It  turns  out  that  the 
extra structural mass is insignificant when compared to the mass of the entire system. 
 
The  concept  for  re-fueling  the  cycler  opens  the  idea  for  the  development  of  in-situ 
propellant  production.  At  a  top  level,  it  is  conceivable  that  some  form  of  cycler  system 
could also be used  in  the design of  in-situ propellant production delivery. Using a cycler 
for  the  delivery  of  in-situ  produced  fuel  would  be  a  tremendous  advantage  because  it 
would require only one delivery vehicle be developed, as opposed to multiple vehicles in 
a staged system. However, in this case in-situ propellant production was not considered 
in the design and return fuel was pre-positioned similar to the staged system. 
 
After  recalculating  the  design  for  the  staged  and  cycler  designs  assuming  pre-
positioning of return fuel, the preferred architecture again is the staged architecture. The 
total mass required  for  the staged architecture went  from 740,000 kg  to 464,000 kg and 
the mass  required  for  the  cycler  architecture  went  from  >>10,000,000  to  6,000,000  kg. 
The results can be seen in Table 10.

The final trade to consider  is the situation  in which both aerobraking and pre-positioning 
of  return  fuel  are  used.  In  this  case,  the  staged  and  cycler  architectures  combine 
architectural  elements  of  the  pre-positioning  and  aerobraking  cases.  The  results  were 
different  from  the  previous  cases:  the  cycler  architecture  is  the  preferred  architecture 
when  the  number  of  mission  exceeds  two.  The  mass  required  for  the  staged 
architecture  went  from  740,000  kg  to  464,000  kg,  while  the  mass  for  the  cycler 
architecture went  from  1,200,000  kg  to  472,000  kg  for  the  first mission  and  359,000  kg 
for  each  additional  mission.  Here  the  benefits  of  the  reusable  nature  of  the  cycler 
dominate the design of the transportation architecture. These results are shown in Table 
11 and the total mass in LEO per number of missions are plotted in Figure 40.

6.3.1.1 Commonality 
When  comparing  the  transportation  designs  for Mars  to  the  design  for  the Moon,  it  can 
be assumed  that  the  resulting  trends  for Mars are  the same  for  the Moon. Coincidently, 
when the ∆v requirement for a Moon mission and the ∆v requirement for a Mars mission, 
assuming  pre-positioning  and  aerobraking  are  compared  the  total  required  ∆Vs  are 
almost  identical  (~8km/s  round-trip).  Therefore,  if  pre-positioning  and  aerobraking  are 
used  in  the  design  of  the  transportation  system,  the  transportation  system  design  for  a 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      114              

 

Mars and Moon mission are almost  identical.  It  is conceivable  that one vehicle could be 
designed such that it could provide the transportation for both a Moon and Mars mission. 

6.3.1.2 Real Options application 
Now that the results of these four trades have been evaluated, should the transportation 
system  be  designed  as  a  cycler  or  as  a  staged  system?  The  answer  is  that  the 
transportation  system  should  at  first  be  designed  as  a  staged  system,  as  expected. 
However, at the same time that the staged design  is being developed or used, research 
into aerobraking and pre-positioning  should be examined.  If  at any  time  it  is discovered 
that  either  pre-positioning  or  aerobraking 
is  unlikely, 
then 
the  design  of 
the 
transportation  system  will  remain  as  a  staged  system.  In  the  event  that  both  pre-
positioning  and  aerobraking  have  been  found  to  be  feasible,  NASA  should  then  and 
only  then  switch  to  a  cycler  transportation  architecture.  Therefore,  in  order  to  have  the 
ability  to  switch  between  architectures,  NASA  needs  to  develop  a  staged  architecture 
that has common elements that could be used in the development for the cycler system. 
This  commonality  could  be  accomplished  through  a  modular  design  for  the  habitation 
module, COV, and transportation, most likely propulsion, system. 
 
The  design  choice  of  building  a  staged  system  with  common  elements  to  a  cycler 
system  is  an  example  of  a  real  option.  NASA  only  needs  to  develop  a  staged  system, 
with  commonality  in  mind,  and  research  aerobraking  and  pre-positioning  in  order  to 
have  the capability  for a cycler system. Only once both pre-positioning and aerobraking 
have been found to be feasible should NASA make the decision to spend the resources 
to switch the design of the transportation system to a cycler.

6.4 Trades 

6.4.1 Introduction 
The  theories  and  tools  about  decisions  analysis,  which  were  presented  in  the  previous 
section, were not used  for all  the  trades we  considered. This part of chapter 6 presents 
the  trades  that  were  considered  for  Earth  to  LEO  options  (launch  site,  Earth  launch 
system for both human and cargo, crew escape system and entry, descent and landing), 
followed  by  trades  for  In-Space  transportation  (crew  exploration  vehicle,  rover, 
habitation  module,  pre-positioning,  planetary  landing  systems,  crew  module  scaling, 
Moon  options,  Mars  options).  This  voluminous  chapter  reflects  all  the  background 
studies  that  were  performed  during  this  class  to  support  our  decisions  for  the  baseline 
mission. 

6.4.2. Earth-to-LEO Options 

6.4.2.1. Launch Site 
The policy that  is more  likely to be applied for this human exploration program  is that all 
critical  launches  should  be  made  from  US  territory.  Taking  into  account  that  all  our 
architectures  benefit  from  a  launch  from  low  latitudes  Kennedy  Space  Center  remains 
the  most  attractive  option.  KSC  has  both  EELV  and  Shuttle  launch  pads,  which 
minimizes  the  need  for  new  ground  infrastructure.  It  should  be  noted  thought  that  there 
is  room  for  international cooperation and  launches  in  the  realm of backup or non-critical 
tasks.  In  this  respect  it  should  be  pointed  out  that  it would  be  very  beneficial  to  use  an 
APAS-89  docking  mechanism.  This  system  was  developed  for  the  Apollo-Soyuz 
program  and  is  the  one  STS  orbiter  uses  now  to  dock with  the  ISS.  It  is  also  the  same 
system used by the Shenzhou, this would leave open the possibility of launching crew in 
that vehicle. 

6.4.2.2. Earth Launch Systems 
Directed  by  the  new  policy,  independent  launch  systems  were  considered  for  the  crew 
and  the  heavy  cargo  needed  for  human  exploration  missions.  Also  following  the  new 
policy, only expendable launchers will be considered. 

6.4.2.2.1. Human Launches 
To  transfer humans  from  the surface of  the Earth  to a destination  in LEO  is a capability 
that, due to the early retirement of the shuttle, has to be reacquired in the US. Since the 
time  between  the  retirement  of  the  shuttle  and  the  new  human  rated  vehicles  lifting  off 
must  be  minimized,  we  have  decided  to  consider  adaptations  of  current  launchers. 
These adaptations should not  involve  re-qualifying every piece of hardware, but  instead 
adding some  redundancy  to  the avionics and, most  importantly,  focusing on a very safe 
launch  escape  system.  Many  lessons  can  be  learned  here  from  the  Chinese  space 
program and how they human-rated the Long March vehicle.

A  strong  reason why  humans  should  be  launched  separately  from  the  cargo  is  that  the 
US may want to have the capability of transferring crew and docking to the International 
Space Station  (ISS). To do  this using a  large cargo  launcher would be complicated and 
expensive.    This  extensible  set  of  forms  that  are  used  to  complete  the  Moon/Mars 
mission does not require the use of the ISS. 
 
The Crew Operations Vehicle (COV) and  functionally-similar Modern Command Module 
(MCM) are  required  to  transport a  total of six people  in some configuration or grouping, 
and  must  have  rendezvous  and  docking  capabilities  in  LEO.  It  is  a  reasonable  to 
assume  20  metric  tons  will  be  required  in  LEO.    The  two  launchers  that  can  soon  be 
adapted  to  launch  such  a  human  mission  are  the  EELVs.  The  Delta-IV  provides  the 
added  advantage  because  it  uses  the  RS68  engine,  which  can  be  used  to  replace  the 
SSME  on  an  STS-derived  heavy  launch  vehicle  for  cargo.    As  much  work  as  possible 
from  the  Orbital  Space  Plane  concepts  that  used  capsules  instead  of  winged  vehicles 
shall  be  reused  in  this  design.    Therefore,  the  launcher  of  choice  for  humans  is  a 
human-rated version of the Delta IV. 

6.4.2.2.2. Cargo Launches 
The  decisions  regarding  the  launch  of  cargo  for  the  Mars  and  Moon  missions  have  a 
very  important  impact on  the overall cost and  feasibility of  the Exploration Program. We 
argue  that  an  STS-based  heavy  launcher  should  be  developed  and  employed  for  this 
mission. 
 
Since  cost  is  a  bounded  variable  in  this  program  it  makes  sense  to  include  some  cost 
estimates  in  the overall evaluation of  the different architectural options. One of  the main 
choices  that  face  the  program  is  the  decision  to  develop  a  heavy  launch  capability.    It 
has  been  argued  that,  if  using modularity  and  extensibility,  the mission’s  hardware  can 
be  broken  down  into  parts,  of  about  20 metric  tons,  that  are manageable  by  the  heavy 
version of the Delta IV (an EELV launcher). We will now compare this option to an STS-
derived heavy launch architecture. 
 
 A typical payload in LEO for a small lunar human exploration mission is 118 metric tons. 
 
To  obtain  the  number  of  Delta  IV  Heavy  (DIV-H)  launches  that  would  be  needed  we 
cannot  just  divide  118  by  20.    A  “penalty  factor”  must  be  applied  that  accounts  for  the 
extra  mass  stemming  from  the  rendezvous  and  docking  systems  as  well  as  the  less 
structurally efficient geometry. This factor has been chosen to be 1.3. This gives roughly 
6 DIV-H launches. 

6.4.2.2.2.1. Cost Estimation  
All  cost  figures were  corrected  for  inflation  into  FY14  dollars  using  the Consumer  Price 
Index  and  the  prognosis  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  and  the 
Congressional  Budget  Office.  The  cost  of  a  DIV-H  launch  in  FY99  is  $170  million. 
Correcting for inflation in FY14, the total cost of the six launches would be $1.4 billion. 
 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      117              

 

This  figure  can  be  benchmarked with  the  cost  of  the  launch  of  a Saturn V  rocket which 
was $431 million FY67, which makes almost $3 billion FY14. 
 
The  cost  estimates  per  launch  of  a  Shuttle  C  were  estimated  to  be  $85  million  FY85, 
which  is $182 million FY14. This valuation, as  is  the case with programs  that do not get 
to  the  stage  of  operation, may  be  incorrect  by  as much  as  a  factor  of  four.    Therefore, 
we will assume that the cost of a STS launch is approximately the cost of a shuttle flight 
and  the  more  reliable  values  that  are  given  for  a  launch  of  the  Space  Shuttle  will  be 
used.  This  value  is  highly  dependent  on  the  flight  rate,  so  again  caution  should  be 
exercised. Assuming a  flight  rate of 6 per year,  the value  that  is commonly accepted  for 
a  shuttle  flight  is  $245  million  FY88,  which  is  $477  million  FY14.    For  a  flight  rate 
required  for  a  crew  of  six,  the  STS-derived  is  probably  too  ambitious.  If  we  assume  a 
flight rate of 4 per year, that is a Moon trip every three months, then a single flight would 
be  about  $715 million FY14.  It  should  be  noted  that  this  value  is  substantially  less  than 
the  value  obtained  for  the  launch  using  6  DIV-Hs.  A  flight  rate  of  2  missions  per  year 
gives a break even in the cost making.  From a cost point of view, both architectures are 
equally  attractive  at  a  price  tag  of  $1.4  billion  FY14.  Naturally  the  same  argument 
applies even more strongly to the case of Mars missions. 
 
Another  advantage  of  the  STS  architecture  over  the  DIV-H  is  that,  since  all  the 
hardware  for a  small Moon mission  is  launched at one  time, automatic  rendezvous and 
docking  capabilities  are  not  a  critical  new  technology  to  be  developed  for  the  lunar 
missions. 
 
This  capability  of  automatic  rendezvous  and  docking  will  be  necessary  when  human 
exploration  missions  to  Mars  will  be  attempted.  The  mass  budget  in  LEO  required  for 
even the simplest human exploration mission to Mars are in the range of 200-600 metric 
tons. This can be reasonably done with 2-6 STS based launches per mission, which is a 
flight rate of Mars missions of roughly 1 per year.  
 
Therefore,  for  an  Apollo-class Moon mission,  one  STS  would  launch most  of  the mass 
and  a  roughly  20  tons  capsule,  launched  separately,  would  carry  the  humans  to  dock 
with the rest of the mass. 
 
Among  several  architectures  for  an  STS-derived  vehicle  the  one  that  seems  most 
attractive  is an external  tank  two SRBs and  three disposable 3RS68 as well as a newly 
developed  J2  class  upper  stage.  Such  a  vehicle  can  deliver  roughly  100 metric  tons  in 
LEO. A detailed explanation and performance curves can be found in Appendix 9.1.3.  
 
It  has  been  argued  that  a  new  launch  system  will  be  better  than  an  STS-based  design 
because  most  of  the  problems  with  the  STS  are  not  a  consequence  of  the  Orbiter’s 
design,  but  are  rather  related  the  parts  that  would  be  kept  in  any  STS-derived.  For 
instance,  note  the  problems  with  the  O-rings  in  the  SRBs  and  the  foam  in  the  ET.  To 
provide  a  complete  answer  to  that  question  falls  beyond  the  scope  of  this  study, 
however  the results of  this study can be used as a baseline  to know what a new design

should  consider  in  terms  of  cost  and  performance  as  compared  to  an  existing  STS 
based system. 

6.4.2.3. Crew Escape Systems 
Human  spaceflight  escape  systems  have  been  developed  for  on-pad  abort  and  boost 
phase emergencies.   Once  in-orbit,  the escape mechanism  for  the crew  is  the same as 
the  normal  re-entry  sequence  into  the  Earth’s  atmosphere.    Throughout  the  history  of 
human  spaceflight,  ejection  seats  and  escape  towers  have  been  developed  to  provide 
this  additional  layer  of  safety  to  the  crew.    However,  the  option  of  including  such 
systems must be traded against significant mass penalties (Nuttall, 1971). 

6.4.2.3.1. Legacy / Proposed Systems 
The  first  manned  orbiter,  Vostok  I,  had  an  ejection  seat  escape  device.    In  addition  to 
providing  an  escape  mechanism  for  the  cosmonaut  on  the  pad  and  during  the  boost 
phase,  this  ejection  seat  functioned  as  the  normal  means  of  landing  after  post-orbital 
descent.   
 
The  first  US  manned  orbiter,  Mercury,  included  an  escape  tower.    This  tower  was 
attached  to  the  top of  the Mercury capsule and consisted of a solid  rocket motor.    In an 
on-pad  or  boost  phase  emergency,  the  rocket motor would  fire,  separating  the manned 
capsule from the booster.  A parachute was deployed after the rocket firing, lowering the 
capsule to the ocean as in a normal post-orbital descent. 
 
The  US  Gemini  escape  system  also  utilized  ejection  seats  just  as  the  Vostok  I.    This 
ejection  system  was  flight-tested  up  to  20,000  ft  and  Mach  1.75.    The  decision  to  use 
ejection  seats  instead  of  the  escape  tower  incorporated  into  the  design  of Mercury was 
driven  by  the  hundreds  of  kilograms  in  mass  savings.    Unlike  the  Vostok  I,  the  dual 
rocket-powered  ejection  seats  were  only  used  in  landing  emergencies  (on-pad,  pre-
orbital  ascent,  post-orbital  descent  over  land).    Normally,  the  Gemini  capsule  was 
lowered to the ocean by a large parachute. 
 
As  in  Mercury,  the  Apollo  Launch  Escape  System  (LES)  utilized  an  escape  tower.  
Providing  an  emergency  escape  capability  to  the  crew  from  the  on-pad  launch 
sequence  to  the  end  of  second-stage  ignition,  the  LES  engines  weighed  5,500  pounds 
with  a  total  structural mass  in  excess  of  9,000lb.    Its maximum  operational  parameters 
were  320,000  feet  and  a  Mach  number  of  8.0.    The  LES  consisted  of  three  solid-
propellant  rocket  motors.    After  the  firings  of  explosive  bolts  to  separate  the  command 
module  from  the  service  module  in  an  escape  sequence,  the  launch  escape  motor 
would  pull  the  11,000  pound  command module  to  safety  using  a  155,000  pound  thrust 
solid rocket (Townsend, 1974).   The  tower-jettison motor was employed  to separate  the 
escape tower from the command module prior to parachute deployment (Lee, 1971). 
 
As  for Apollo,  the Soyuz Emergency Escape System  (EES)  utilizes  an  escape  tower  of 
solid-propellant rocket motors to pull  the crew capsule  to safety  in an emergency during

on-pad  launch  operations  of  the  boost  phase.    The  EES  is  operational  throughout  all 
phases of powered flight trajectory prior to orbital insertion (Kolesov, 1969).  
 
A  seated  tractor  rocket  escape  system  was  proposed  for  the  STS  in  the  wake  of  the 
Challenger  accident.    The  tractor  system  is  lighter  and  less  voluminous  than  an 
equivalent  ejection  seat  system,  however,  aerodynamic 
“blow-back”  causes 
unsuccessful extraction at altitudes above 15,000 feet (Ondler, 1989). 
 
Utilizing  Lockheed  Martin’s  Pad  Abort  Demonstration  (PAD)  platform  consisting  of 
sensors  and  mannequins  in  a  simulated  crew  cabin  to  measure  accelerations  and 
motions  generated,  NASA  will  conduct  seven  integrated  PAD  test  flights  during  2005-
2006 to test an escape tower system of four 50,000-pound thrust RS-88 rocket engines.  
These  tests  aim  to  trade  various  propulsion  systems;  parachute  deployment,  vehicle 
configurations, and  landing  techniques  for a  future  tower escape system  (Orbital Space 
Plane/Crew Exploration Vehicle). 

6.4.2.3.2. Safety vs. Mass Penalty Trade for COV Tower Escape 
Ejection  and  tractor  rocket  seats  are  lighter  than  tower  escape  systems  by  an  order  of 
magnitude—weighing  hundreds  of  pounds  instead  of  thousands.    However,  because 
the  tower escape system  is  jettisoned during ascent while ejection and  tractor seats are 
carried  in  the service module  throughout  the mission, LEO payload mass  reductions  for 
tower  escape  systems  are  approximately  only  two  to  five  times  greater  than  ejection 
and tractor seats.

For  Delta-IV  vehicles,  the  average  impact  is  ~6%  reduction  in  payload  to  LEO.  
Specifically,  a  Delta-IV  designed  to  launch  6,760kg  would  have  the  payload  mass 
reduced  by  441kg,  a  Delta-IV  designed  to  launch  9,070kg  reduced  by  610kg,  and  a 
Delta-IV  designed  to  launch  20,500kg  by  1,210kg.    The  Atlas-V  vehicles  have  an 
average  5%  reduction  in  payload  mass  to  LEO.    For  Atlas-V  launchers  designed  to 
launch  10,300kg,  12,500kg,  and  20,520kg,  the  payload  mass  reductions  are  621kg, 
530kg,  and  880kg,  respectively.    For  an  EELV-derived  heavier  lift  vehicle  capable  of 
placing 50,000kg  in LEO, adding  the escape  system would have a much  lower effect—
reducing the payload capability by only 251kg (or about 0.5%).

6.4.2.4.1. Vehicle Shape adapted from (Larson, 1999) 
To  appreciate  the  available  options  for  entry  vehicle  shapes,  one  must  first  determine 
the  criteria  affecting  selection.    Decreasing  development  cost  has  been  identified  as  a 
major  constraint  in  the  project.    Another  highly  important  requirement  is  minimizing 
mass.    A  subjective  criterion  to  represent  minimum  mass  for  given  vehicle’s  shape  is 
volumetric efficiency.   A  third objective might be  to  limit  the peak deceleration  forces on 
the  crew.    Clearly,  there  are  other  criteria  affecting  the  shape  of  the  entry  vehicle,  but 
these  have  been  identified  as  the most  important.    Next,  the  relative  importance  of  the 
identified criteria is determined: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Each  option  is  pair-wise  compared  in  Figure  43.    That  is,  each  option  in  the  vertical 
column  is compared  to each option across  the  row.    If  the  first option  is estimated  to be 
less  expensive  than  the  second,  then  a  “1”  is  placed  in  the  box.    If  it  appears  more 
expensive,  then  a  “-1”  is  placed  in  the  box.    If  no  significant  difference  can  be 
determined,  then  the  pair  is  assigned  a  “0”.    The  sum  at  the  end  of  the  row  is  the 
relative  score  for  that  option.    Similarly,  the  volumetric  efficiency  is  subjectively 
assessed  by  how  effectively  each  shape  can  contain  a  roughly  cylindrical  pressure 
vessel  for  the  crew  and  equipment.    Peak  deceleration  is  compared  by  assuming 
shapes  with  higher  lift-to-drag  ratios  maintain  lower  peak  deceleration  forces  on  the 
crew during entry.   
 
Soyuz,  Apollo,  and  heat  shield  with  afterbody  all  have  the  same  development  cost, 
whereas  the  lifting  body  will  have  the  highest  development  cost.    The  biconic  most 
closely  resembles  a  cylinder.    Soyuz  and  Apollo  are  almost  as  efficient  as  the  biconic, 
but  their  blunt  conic  shape  is  more  conical.    The  heat  shield  and  afterbody  shape  is 
cylindrical,  but  the  cylindrical  diameter  is  smaller  than  the  heat  shield,  so  some  volume 
is wasted.  The lifting body sacrifices volumetric efficiency in the interest of streamlining.  
The comparison method used  for assessing peak entry deceleration  indicates  the  lifting 
body would have the lowest and the Soyuz would have the highest deceleration.

Descent  and  landing  is  the  flight  phase  designed  to  reduce  the  horizontal  and  vertical 
velocities  to a desired  value  for  surface  touchdown.   The  thick atmosphere of  the Earth 
allows  a  spacecraft  to  follow  the  aeroentry  phase  with  an  inflatable,  parachute,  or 
parafoil  deceleration  all  the  way  to  the  surface.    The  Apollo  Command  Module  used 
parachutes  to an ocean splashdown, and  the Russian Soyuz capsule  rides a parachute 
until a retrorocket fires just before a land-based touchdown.  
 
To  achieve  mission  objectives,  atmospheric  entry  is  constrained  by  three  fundamental 
requirements:  deceleration,  heating,  and  accuracy.    Although  a  vehicle’s  structure  and 
payload  limit  maximum  deceleration,  we  must  consider  the  requirements  of  a  human-
rated exploration system.   Well-conditioned humans can withstand a maximum of about 
12 Earth g’s  for a short  time.   A system designed  for de-conditioned crew must produce 
less than 3.5-5 Earth g’s (Hale, 1994).

Friction  between  the  speeding  entry  and  atmosphere  generates  heating  that  must  be 
dissipated during  the  few minutes of atmospheric entry.   The  thermal protection system 
must withstand the total heating and the peak-heat rate encountered during entry. 
 
A  third  important  mission  requirement  is  accuracy.    The  spacecraft’s  capability  to 
maintain  a  predetermined  trajectory  depends  on  its  inertial  navigation  systems  and 
available ground support.  
 
Details of the calculations can be found in Appendix 9.2.2.7. 

6.4.2.4.2.1. Inflatable Alternatives 
As an alternative to the heavy ablative heat shield systems, researchers have refocused 
studies  on  inflatable  technologies  such  as  the  ballute  and  Inflatable  Braking  Device 
(IBD).   The  IBD  is an aerodynamically  shaped  cone  to  increase  the  surface  area  of  the 
entry  vehicle.    The  increase  in  surface  directly  affects  the  ballistic  coefficient,  β,  of  the 
vehicle, thereby decreasing the maximum heat and deceleration loads during entry.   
 
A  Primary  IBD  is  inflated  just  before  reaching  the  atmospheric  interface.    Once  the 
maximum  deceleration,  pressure,  and  heat  flux  are  passed,  a  Second  IBD  inflates  to 
replace  the  parachute  system  at  the  appropriate  altitude.    A  Third  IBD  may  also  be 
inflated  to  increase  the  size  of  the  vehicle  to  achieve  the  required  terminal  velocity.  
Depending  on  the  design,  the  landing  system  can  either  be  one  of  the  conventional 
landing  systems  or  can  be  replaced  by  one  of  the  stages  of  the  IBD  that  cushions  the 
impact. 
 
EDL  systems  based  on  the  conventional  approach  benefit  from  a  strong  and  proven 
heritage, but depend on  the use of a heavy heat shield and a dedicated  landing system 
for  re-entry.    To  offer  a  unique  perspective  on  such  a  system’s  purported  benefits  of 
inflatable  over  conventional  EDL  systems,  a  parametric  comparison  study  was 
performed  on  for  an  Apollo-class  Earth  return  vehicle.    Graphical  results  are  shown  in 
Figure  45.    Because  of  the  infancy  of  research  in  inflatable  technologies,  sizing  was 
scaled from a proposed post-Beagle2, robotic mission to Mars.

6.4.2.4.2.2. Earth EDL Architecture Discussion 
To  subjectively  assess  the  trade  space  of  possible  descent  and  landing  system 
combinations,  a  pair-wise  option  comparison  was  performed  in  Figure  46.    The 
methodology  used  in  this  study  follows  that  of  Section  6.4.2.4.1.    The  selective  criteria 
and relative weighting chosen for this comparison were: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  mass,  cross-range,  and  peak  deceleration  of  the  descent  and  landing  systems 
were  calculated  using  the methods  previously  stated.    The minimum  development  cost 
was subjectively assessed based on current technology readiness level (NASA/TRL).

The  analytical  calculations  assume  the  use  of  an  Apollo-class  Earth  re-entry  capsule.  
The  conventional  systems  rely  on  an  ablative SLA561V  heat  shield.   The EDL  systems 
that  include  inflatable  devices  substitute  parachutes  with  the  Third  IBD.    The 
conventional system that includes retrorockets for touchdown deceleration also includes 
the release of drogue parachutes.  Notice that the purely  inflatable system has the  least 
mass,  the conventional system with parachutes  require  the  least development  time,  the

inflatable  system  with  retrorocket  decelerators  produces  minimum  peak  deceleration, 
and  the  inflatable  system  with  parafoil  technology  has  the  maximum  cross-range 
capability. 
 
The options are subjectively ranked, using the selection criteria weightings  listed above.  
Notice  that  the  ranking  of  the  entry  and  descent  architectures  follows  the  distribution  of 
the  system  mass.    This  ranking  should  be  used  only  as  a  qualitative  estimation  that  is 
inherently dependent on the relative selection criteria weightings chosen.

The  parametric  comparison  of  Apollo-class  inflatable  and  conventional  Earth  EDL 
systems  yielded  interesting  results.    The  inflatable  system  had  15%  to  20%  less mass, 
40% to 45% less maximum deceleration, 20% to 25% less average surface temperature 
than  a  conventional  heat  shield  system  with  a  cross-range  capability  that  is  roughly 
equal  to  a  parafoil  system.    Additionally,  the  inflatable  device  can  serve  as  an  air-
cushion  for  ground-based  landings  or  as  a  flotation  device  for  water-based  landings.  
Although  the  inflatable  systems  seem  promising,  they  are  untested.   Consequently,  the 
system’s  cost,  reliability,  and  safety  are  difficult  to  estimate.    A  test  flight  in  February 
2000  from Babakin Space Center was only partially successful.   As a  result,  the design 
of  the  return  vehicle  should  be modular.    Instead  of  integrating  the  heat  shield  into  the 
spacecraft  body,  like  the  Apollo  Command  Module,  the  ablative  heat  shield  should  be 
designed  as  a  module  of  the  return  vehicle.    When  inflatable  or  other  next-generation 
technology  has  been  proven  for  human  spaceflight,  the  conventional  system  could  be 
replaced with minimal  cost.    Furthermore,  a modular  ablative  heat  shield might  support 
the construction a reusable return vehicle design. 

6.4.2.5. Landing Site 
The  chosen  EDL  architecture  directly  influences  the  choice  of  landing  site.    The  Apollo 
Command Module landed in the water to reduce the touchdown impact of its unpowered 
descent.    Similarly,  Soyuz  fires  a  small  solid-motor  thruster  just  before  touching  down 
on 
In  addition,  uncertain  atmospheric  density,  navigation  errors,  and 
 
land. 
unanticipated  winds  can  push  an  uncontrollable  vehicle,  such  as  a  spacecraft  on 
parachutes,  away  from  its  intended  landing  location.    The  Apollo  Command  Module 
landed  in  the  South  Pacific  Ocean  to  accommodate  its  large  landing  footprint.  
Contrastingly,  the  steerable  parafoil  used  by  the  X-38  lifting  body  permits  a  smaller 
landing area and a touchdown on land.   
 
There  are  roughly  three  recovery  possibilities:  land,  sea,  and  lake/coastal.    Recovery 
operations  on  land  can  be  relatively  fast  and  inexpensive  by  utilizing  existing 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      126              

 

infrastructure.    Land-based  touchdowns  require  a  sink  rate  below  7.5  m/s,  whereas 
water  landings  can  sustain  velocities  of  about  9.5 m/s.   Because  land-based  landing  g-
loads  can  be  2  to  3  times  higher  than  water-based  landings,  a  crushable  nose  or 
inflatable  air-cushion  is  required.    To  distribute  the  impact  forces  over  the  entire  lower 
surface of the spacecraft, a self-leveling honeycomb might be used to plastically deform 
to absorb the shock of the  landing.  Possible materials for the honeycomb might  include 
lightweight metal alloys, carbon-carbon composites, and high density styrene polymers. 
This  design  would  provide  significant  mass  savings  over  conventional  landing 
mechanisms because a composite honeycomb weighs a fraction of aluminum or steel. 
 
Sea-based  landings  tolerate  higher  impact  velocities,  reducing  the  mass  needed  to 
decelerate  the  entry  vehicle.    The  mass  needed  for  flotation  bags  might  partially  offset 
this benefit, unless an inflatable landing system is used.  Water also provides immediate 
cooling  of  the  overheated  spacecraft.    The  Apollo  program  demonstrated  that  recovery 
operations at sea can be costly, and can be adversely affected by poor weather. 
 
Sea  and  lake/coastal-based  landings  share  similar  properties,  except  that  lake  or 
coastal-based  landings  have  lesser  infrastructure  costs.    A  lake-based  landing  could 
use  existing  Coast  Guard  recovery  capabilities,  instead  of  deploying  a  large  Naval 
Carrier  Battle  Group.    Possible  landing  sites  for  such  a  landing  might  be  the  Gulf  of 
Mexico  or  the  Great  Lakes.    A  lake/coastal-based  landing  requires  a  re-entry  system 
with a large cross-range capability to maintain a precise trajectory (inflatable or parafoil).  
An  inflatable  system might  provide  both  flotation  capabilities  for  such  a  landing  and  air-
cushioning  for  an  inadvertent  land-based  touchdown.    Because  of  its  cost  benefits  and 
advantageous  qualities,  the  chosen  EDL  architecture  (see  Section  6.4.2.4.)  would  be 
well-suited  for  a  lake/coastal-based  landing  site.    When  inflatable  technology  is 
validated  and  replaces  the  conventional  heat  shield,  it  will  also  replace  the  separate 
flotation device. 
 

6.4.3. In-Space Options 
A  number  of  trades  were  examined  in  determining  the  forms  for  the  extensible 
Moon/Mars  mission  architecture.    The  space  transportation  system  is  a  network  of 
modules  that was developed  from  the  trades described below.    It was assumed  that  the 
space  transportation system does not require  the use of  the  International Space Station 
(ISS)  as  an  assembly  or  return  point.    This  was  done  to  ensure  that  NASA  can  divest 
itself  from  the  ISS  and  STS  to meet  the  Space  Exploration  goals  within  budgetary  and 
political constraints. 

6.4.3.1. Transportation Modules 

6.4.3.1.1. Mass Transportation Vehicle 
The Mass Transportation Vehicle  (MTV), as presented  in  the baseline mission,  is made 
of  the Crew Operations Vehicle  (COV) and  the Habitation Module  (HM).  It  is part of  the 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      127              

 

Crew  Exploration  System  (CES),  which  consists  of  all  the  forms  necessary  to  support 
manned exploration of the solar system. 
 
The different phases that the MTV is required to perform is in space transportation.  The 
first  trade  study,  which  led  us  to  dissociate  the  Earth  to  LEO  transportation  from  the  In 
Space transportation is described below and shown in Figure 47. 
 
-  From Earth to LEO and back to Earth 
In-space travel: LEO to another destination in space 
- 

6.4.3.1.1.1. MTV Trade Study 
For  this  initial  trade,  we  considered  only  small  range  exploration  (up  to  8  crew  and  40 
days), which excluded Mars exploration. The results and lessons learned from this short 
study led us to the choice of separating the forms as much as possible.  Most notably, it 
will  be  highlighted  that  separating  the  function  of  in-space  and  Earth  to  LEO 
transportation  is  a  beneficial  choice.    In  this  initial  study,  the  CES  (Crew  Exploration 
System)  performs  the  following:  it  goes  from  Earth’s  surface,  travels  in  orbit  or  further 
(but  middle  range)  and  comes  back  to  the  Earth  surface’s  surface  at  the  end  of  the 
mission. 
 
The basic functions that are required are listed below: 
-  Support and shelter the crew during launch 
-  Provide crew escape in case of a launch emergency 
-  Provide a habitat for the crew during in-space transportation 
-  Provide energy to displace the crew module during in-space phases 
-  Perform landing on a selected site 
 
For  performing  these  functions,  we  have  studied  two  forms:  service  module  and  crew 
module (called HM here) – the names are internal to this trade study.

A  strong  inter-level  dependence  exists  between  technologies  used  for  the  various 
functions  to  be  performed.    For  example,  the  mass  of  the  re-entry  system  depends  on 
the volume of the capsule, on the type of deceleration device, etc.  Figure 48 shows the 
decision  tree  for  key  technologies/options  that have been  traded.   Links between  levels 
represent  preferable  or  feasible  options.    For  example,  the  lake/coastal  landing  site 
option  requires  a  re-entry  system  with  a  large  cross-range  capability  for  precisely 
landing into a small body of water (inflatable or parafoil). 
 
Three main categories of HM have been identified, as shown on the figure below: 
•  Combined  (one  unique  form  which  transports  the  crew  for  all  the  sections; 
Earth to LEO, In-Space and Landing) 
•  Separate (two different forms; one performs In-Space transport and the other 
performs Earth to LEO and landing) 
•  Flexible  (the  same  core  transports  the  crew,  but  minor  modifications  are 
made so that it is able to land or perform In-Space transportation) 

 
For each category, the vehicle could be expendable or reusable (see 
Figure 49).

Figure 49: Classification of existing crew transport modules 

 
To  assist  in  decision-making,  three  metrics  were  used:  mass,  TRL,  rank.    The 
Technology  Readiness  Level  (TRL)  methodology  is  a  NASA  metric  based  on  a  nine-
stage  process  ranging  from  the  basic  principle  being  observed  and  reported  (#1)  to 
flight  proven  through  successful  mission  operations  (#9).    The  rank-measurement 
enabled  a  normalized  comparison  across  elements.    For  example,  the  launch  escape 
system  shouldn’t  be  chosen  for  the  same  reason  as  the  EDL  elements.    Each  element 
of  the  CES  (each  row  in  the  network)  has  its  own  criteria.    Ranking  also  enables 
comparison  between  each  option  in  a  row  with  different metrics,  while  trying  to  assess 
each  option  as  objectively  as  possible 
for 
trading  different  measures  of 
performance/priority.    Ranking  also  allows  weighing  metrics  by  priority.  Depending  on 
the priority, you can weigh the metric so that the final ranking reflects priorities. 
 
Three of the many combinations were considered in detail: 
 

• 

•  Modern  Apollo  CM  -  MCM  -  Tower  Escape,  Modern  CM  and  SM, 
Conventional Re-entry, and Sea Recovery. 
Improved  Soyuz  -  IS  (Best  Rank)  -  Ejection  Seat,  Soyuz  DM  & OM  &  SM, 
Inflatable Re-entry, and Lake Recovery. 
•  New  Type  -  XTV  (Lowest  TRL)  -  Ejection  Seat,  OASIS  CTV  &  CTM, 
Inflatable Re-entry, and Lake Recovery. 

 
The mass of these configurations is shown in Figure 50.

The  Improved  Soyuz  (IS)  architecture  is  a  separate-expendable  type  of  Habitable 
Module.  It  is  comprised  of  all  of  the  best-ranked  components  for  the  launch  escape 
system,  habitable  volume,  service  module,  re-entry  system  and  landing  site.    This 
architecture has  the Ejection Seat Launch Escape System, which  is  ranked as  the best 
launch escape system based on the metrics of mass penalty, reliability, cost and weight.  
As  can  be  expected,  if  the  relative  weights  are  altered,  the  final  launch  escape  system 
ranking  may  change.    The  separate  expendable  Soyuz  crew  module  had  the  best 
overall  ranking 
in 
the 
following  categories  (minimum 
launch  mass,  minimum 
development  cost, autonomy and  flexibility).   Similarly,  the best-ranked  technique of  re-
entry  was  inflatable  re-entry.    This  was  based  upon  the  minimum  mass,  minimum 
development  cost,  minimum  deceleration  and  maximum  cross-range.    The  method  of 
landing  that was  best  ranked was  a water  landing.    This was  based  upon  the minimum 
recovery  time,  least  weather  affected,  minimum  infrastructure  cost  and  maximum 
landing speed. 
 
Scaling was performed for both the launch escape system and the crew module.  Based 
on  the  analysis,  which  proposes  that  mass  of  the  vehicle  is  a  function  of  both  the 
mission duration and number of crew, it is clear that the length of the mission from Earth 
to  LEO  does  not  greatly  affect  the  overall  CES  mass.    It  should  be  noted  that  the 
mission durations highlighted here are completed arbitrary and were chosen to  illustrate 
that  the  required  increases  in  structure  and  CES  component  mass  will  not  be  the 
primary factor affecting mass increases.

The  “Modern”  Apollo  uses  all  of  the  same  methods  of  re-entry  and  transportation 
modules  as  the  original  Apollo,  however  a  structural  analysis  was  performed,  which 
determined  a  new  vehicle mass  based  on modern materials.    For  this  architecture,  the 
COV mass is greater, but it is still moderately dependent on the mission duration. 
 
Using  the  same  methods  of  launch  escape  and  re-entry  as  the  Soyuz  based 
architecture  discussed  earlier,  the  Oasis  XTV-CTM  combination  was  chosen  as  a  third 
architecture  to  present  because  of  its  lowest  TRL,  but  also  second-best  rank  after  the 
Improved Soyuz.   For  this  architecture,  the mission duration  had  a  greater  influence  on 
the overall architecture mass  compared  to  the other architecture.   The vehicle structure 
comprises  a  much  greater  proportion  of  the  overall  mass  than  in  the  case  of  the 
“Modern Apollo”.   Since  the mission  duration  is  related  to  the  habitable  volume  and  the 
external  vehicle  surface  area  scales  the  structural  mass,  the  overall  mass  is  more 
greatly affected for this case.  Even though this configuration had the lowest TRL, which 
could  indicate  the  use  of  advanced  or  modern  technologies,  other  configurations  had 
lower masses. 
 
A summary of the three configurations is shown in Figure 51.

Figure 51: Three COV configurations for launch from Earth to LEO 

 

 
The  mass  of  the  COV  was  approximated  as  5708kg  from  the  Model  described  in 
Appendix  9.1.1.  It  was  assumed  that  the  EDL  mass  could  be  neglected  and  the 
additional  mass  required  to  aerobrake  at  Mars  was  15%  greater  than  the  COV  mass.  
Similarly,  the  additional  mass  required  to  aerobrake  at  Earth  was  6%  greater  than  the 
COV mass (Larson, 1999). 

6.4.3.1.1.2. Baseline Transportation Form Selection 
The main lesson learned from this trade study was that the  forms used  for Segment 1 
(Earth  to LEO and back  to Earth) and  Segment  2  (In-Space  transportation) should  be 
separate and expendable. Such a separation leads to a high rank and low mass within 
the  framework  of  this  trade  study.    A  vehicle  that  performs  all  the  functions  at  once 
(such  as  the  Shuttle)  is  sub-optimal  and  leads  to  additional mass,  especially  when  it  is 
reusable.

6.4.3.1.1.2.1. Transportation Form for Segment 1 
The  conclusions  highlighted  in  the  previous  Section  guided  the  from  selection  process 
for Segment 1 (Earth to LEO and back to Earth) of the baseline mission. The paragraph 
below  explains  why  the  Modern  Command  Module  (MCM)  form  was  selected  for  the 
baseline mission. 
 
When determining the type of COV to use for launch and re-entry, the mass of the three 
configurations  without  their  respective  Service  Modules  were  determined.    From  this 
analysis,  the Modern  Apollo Command Module  was  observed  to  have  the  lowest mass 
(5,200kg) and was selected as  the  form  for Earth  launch at  the start of  the mission and 
Earth  EDL  at  the  end  of  the mission.    Since  this  vehicle  has  approximately  three  times 
less the habitable volume per person as compared to the OASIS XTV, this may indicate 
that  separating  the  function  of  crew  habitation  and  re-entry  is  beneficial  to  overall 
mission mass reduction. 

6.4.3.1.1.2.2. Transportation Form for Segment 2 
For  Segment  2  (In-Space  transportation),  a  modular  approach  was  taken  to  ensure 
increased  commonality  between  the  forms  required  to  complete  a  Moon  and  Mars 
exploration mission. 

6.4.3.1.2. Rovers to Support Planetary Surface Operations 
Surface  exploration  of  the  Moon  and  Mars  will  require  a  diverse  array  of  robotic 
capabilities.   Mobility systems such as rovers are critical  to achieving scientific missions 
and  accomplishing  a  variety  of  operational  requirements.    Use  of  rovers  will  increase 
effectiveness  and  safety  while  reducing  costs.    Tasks  to  be  performed  include 
instrument deployment, soil manipulation, and human transportation.

Four  categories  of  rovers  exist.    Automated,  autonomous  rovers  are  equipped  with 
artificial 
intelligence 
for  hazard  avoidance  and  are  capable  of  collecting  and 
communicating  scientific  data.    Autonomous  rovers  on  precursor missions may  identify 
potential  landing  sites  for  human  missions  and  refine  Lunar/Martian  scientific  goals.  
Remote  controlled  rovers  may  be  utilized  by  human  operators  on  Mars  for  missions  of 
varying  duration.    Unpressurized  rovers  can  be  driven  by  astronauts  but  should  only 
support  exploration  within  walking  distance  of  living  quarters.    The  Apollo  Lunar  Rover 
Vehicle  and  Soviet  Lunakhod  are  legacy  unpressurized  rover  systems  (Arno,  1999).  
Pressurized  rovers  possess  a  self-sustained  life  support  system  and  enable  extended 
excursions  for  astronauts  in  a  shirtsleeve  environment.    The  functional  requirements  of 
the Rovers for the various missions are shown in Table 13.

6.4.3.1.2.1. Modular Architecture for Unmanned Rovers 
To  support  these  operations, modular  rover  architecture  is  proposed  whereby  rover  for 
instrument deployment and soil manipulation tasks can be assembled from an  inventory 
of modules  to  accomplish  a  specific  task.    This  inventory  of modules  includes  actuated 
joints,  links,  end-effectors,  sensors,  and  mobility  units.    Initial  configuration  and 
reconfiguration  can  be  done  autonomously  or  by  an  astronaut  (Farritor,  2000).    A 
modular  architecture  for  robotic  surface  operations  may  represent  a  new  paradigm  in 
NASA robot design but it does not rely on developing new technologies.   
 
Mission Scenario (cid:198)  Requirements (cid:198)  Design Specifications (cid:198)  Modular Inventory 
 
For  our  design  space—multiple  missions  to  the  Moon  and  Mars—a  modular  rover 
architecture was selected for a variety of reasons: 
 

1)  Efficiency: for missions requiring a wide variety of tasks a single modular system 
is  superior  to  creating  a  dedicated  robot  for  each  task,  additionally,  packaging 
modules  on  launch  vehicle  may  be  more  efficient  than  packaging  assembled 
robots in terms of mass and volume 
2)  Adaptability:  modules  enable  construction  of  novel  robots,  including  robots  for 
tasks that are not foreseen 
3)  Reliability:  failed  modules  can  be  replaced,  different  configurations  can 
potentially accomplish  the same  task, Mars missions should place a premium on 
this reliability  
4)  Extensibility:  fits  spiral  development  model  of  increasing  capability  over 
exploration program life  
5)  Cost: standardized modules will limit non-recurring research and development 

6.4.3.1.2.2. Human Mobility 
A  variety  of  design  architectures  are  possible  with  open  and  pressurized  rovers  to 
transport  astronauts  on  the  Lunar  and  Martian  surface.    For  mobility,  tracks,  screw 
drives,  legs,  rockets,  and  balloons  are  all  available,  although  wheels  offer  the  greatest 
overall  performance  when  considering  energy,  ground  pressure,  ground  clearance, 
reliability,  and  human  factor  requirements.    For  rover  structure  and  pressure  shell,  an 
inner  pressure  shell  of  aluminum  alloy  and  an  outer  shell  of  aluminum  and 
carbon/graphite  epoxy  offer  a  strong  baseline  design.    The  communications  system 
must  maintain  contact  with  all  manned  rovers  at  all  times  for  navigation,  scientific 
investigations, and safety.   As a  legacy system with proven  reliability, hydrogen-oxygen 
fuel cells are an  ideal power source.   For  life support, an open system  is  recommended 
given  the  relatively  short  excursions  and  high  mass  penalty  (~1000kg)  to  recover 
consumables (Arno, 1999). 
 
An  open,  unpressurized  rover  is  limited  to  sorties  of  10km  for  safety  considerations 
(within walking distance of  their surface habitat).   These vehicles will  typically support a 
crew  of  two.    Therefore,  although  not  a  requirement,  a  pressurized  rover  capable  of 
sorties  ranging  from 50-500km and 12-400 hours duration  is a  recommended option  for 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      135              

 

extended-stay  missions  (Arno,  1999).    The  pressurized  rover  will  have  an  airlock  to 
support  EVA.    Three  astronauts will  crew  each  pressurized  rover  during  regular  sorties 
in  order  to  enable  two-astronaut  EVA  with  a  third  remaining  in  the  vehicle.    For  safety 
considerations,  it  is  recommended  to  have  a  pressurized  rover  in  reserve  to  conduct 
rescue missions of astronauts beyond walking distance of the main base. 

6.4.3.1.3. Habitation Module 
The  Habitation  Module  (HM)  will  sustain  human  life  for  an  extended-duration  Mars 
mission.    This  module  will  be  launched  in  two  pieces  and  assembled  in  LEO,  allowing 
the  overall  volume  to  not  be  limited  by  the  minimum  launch  volume  requirements  (see 
Figure  52).    Since  there  are  two  modules,  none,  one  or  both  can  be  used  for  each 
mission,  depending  on  the  mission  requirements  for  duration  and  crew  size.    This 
module  must  have  propulsion  capabilities  to  perform  docking  maneuvers  in  both  Earth 
and Mars (or Lunar) orbit.

Figure 52: Mars/Moon Transfer Vehicle (MTV) 

 
Following  the  Mars  study  performed  by  (Larson,  1999),  the  mass  of  the  HM  was 
calculated  as  ~55,000kg  for  a  crew  of  six,  depending  on  a  number  of  critical  factors 
(mission  duration,  type  of  radiation  protection,  life  support,  supplies,  aeroshield  and 
power requirements). 
 
The HM  is composed of separable modules  that promote significant modular spacecraft 
design  flexibility.    Six  of  these  modules  are  combined  in  two  groups  of  three  and 
platform,  forming  one  large  volume  required  for  a  Mars  mission.    Based  on  Larson 
(1999), it was assumed that a habitable volume of 20m3 per person was required for a 6 
crew,  6-month mission.    For  this  analysis,  30m3  was  specified  per  person.    It  was  also 
assumed  by  Larson  (1999)  that  33%  of  the  total  volume was  assumed  to  be  habitable.  
Therefore,  a  total  volume  of  540m3  could  be  created  by  6  octahedrons  as  shown  in 
Figure 52, each with a 5.6m diameter.   As shown  in Figure 53,  this volume agreed well 
with other pressurized spacecraft volumes.

6.4.3.1.4. Pre-positioning 

 

6.4.3.1.4.1. Pre-positioning Overview 
Pre-positioning  items  needed  for  a  space  exploration  mission  is  the  act  of  sending 
hardware  or  any  other  required  cargo  to  its  respective  destination  in  advance  of  the 
“main”  portion  of  the  exploration  mission.    In  the  case  of  this  space  exploration 
architecture,  the  “main”  portion  of  the  mission  is  the  launch  through  the  landing  of  the 
human crew. 
 
Non-time  critical  components  with  lifetimes  of  appropriate  length  that  are  not  required 
for the crew to have available during transfer to their destination are good candidates for 
pre-positioning. 
 
The  pre-positioning  of mission  components  will  likely  be  accomplished  with  an  efficient 
propulsion  system  technology  such  as  electric  propulsion.    Once  this  propulsion 
technology  is  successfully  demonstrated  for  large  masses,  electric  propulsion  will  then 
be  used  to  send  more  exploration  equipment.   However,  it  should  be  mentioned  that 
until  the  ability  of  the  crew  to  live  off  re-supply  provided  by  electric  or  other  efficient 
propulsion systems, or  “live off  the  land” has been demonstrated,  the crew should carry 
all of the material with them needed for safe return.   

6.4.3.1.4.2. Pre-positioning Benefits 

6.4.3.1.4.2.1. Mass Reduction 
One  major  reason  to  pre-position  items  for  a  space  exploration  mission  is  to  take 
advantage of being able to transport this cargo using a more efficient propulsion system 
than  would  be  used  otherwise.    This  results  in  a  reduced  overall  mass  of  the  pre-
positioned  module.    For  the  purposes  of  this  project,  it  is  assumed  that  this  propulsion 
system will be a form of electric propulsion. 
 
Electric  propulsion,  while  more  efficient,  has  much  less  thrust  than  engines  using 
chemical  propellant.    This  requires  a  longer  time  of  flight  to  get  the  cargo  to  its 
destination.  This necessitates that the cargo being pre-positioned is not time critical. 
 
This  increased  efficiency  of  electric  propulsion  over  chemical  is  due  to  a  significantly 
increased  specific  impulse,  Isp.   The  famous  “rocket  equation,”  shown  below,  is  used  to 
exemplify why this is beneficial.

where  ∆V  is  the  change  in  velocity  provided  by  the  engine  burn,  g0  is  acceleration  due

This  shows  that  an  increase  in  Isp  results  in  a  decrease  of  initial  total  mass  required.  
This  is  the  resultant  benefit  of  a more  efficient  propulsion  system.    The  relaxed  time  of 
flight of the pre-positioned mission phase, compared to the crewed segment, makes this 
advantage possible. 
 
The  initial  mass  benefit  due  to  pre-positioning  for  this  project  can  be  seen  in  Table  15 
and Table 16 for missions to the Moon and Mars, respectively.

For  missions  to  the  Moon,  Table  15  shows  a  significant  mass  savings  due  to  pre-
positioning  non-crewed  mission  components  at  the  destination.    For  missions  to  Mars, 
Table  16  shows  an  increasing  benefit  as more mission  components  are  pre-positioned.  
The  use  of  efficient  propulsion  systems  such  as  electric  propulsion  combined  with  a 
relaxed time of flight requirement allow for such a mass savings. 

6.4.3.1.4.2.2. Launch Vehicle Selection 
A  more  subtle  benefit  for  pre-positioning  non-time  critical  mission  components  is  the 
ability  to  use  less  expensive,  non-human-rated  launch  vehicles  to  launch  these  pre-
positioned components.  The launch vehicle used to launch the crew will likely be a new 
or  partially  new  heavy-lift  launch  vehicle  design.    The  human-rated  launch  vehicle  is 
likely  to  cost  more  per  launch  than  launch  vehicles  such  as  the  Evolved  Expendable 
Launch Vehicles. 
 
For  example,  EELVs  could  be  used  to  launch  “packages”  to  be  pre-positioned  in 
advance of  the main crewed portion of  the mission as opposed  to  launching portions of 
this pre-positioned cargo with the crew on a more expensive heavy-lift launch vehicle. 
 
In  addition,  if  enough  mission  components  are  pre-positioned  using  launch  vehicles 
such  as  EELVs,  a  reduction  of  the  payload  mass  requirement  for  this  new  man-rated 
launch vehicle could be realized.

6.4.3.1.4.2.3. Risk Reduction 
An  inherent  advantage  with  pre-positioning  is  the  reduction  of  mission  risk.    This  risk 
reduction  is  possible  for  two  main  reasons.    First,  mission  planners  on  Earth  would 
know  in  advance  of  the  launch  of  the  crew  if  the  pre-positioned  components  were 
successfully  deployed  in  their  desired  locations.    Second,  mission  planners  would  also 
know if these components are functioning properly before the launch of the crew. 
 
If  a  pre-positioned  mission  critical  component  is  found  to  not  be  functioning  properly 
before the crew launches on their mission, the mission planners have several options to 
solve  the  problem.    One  option  is  to  try  fixing  the  problem  via  communication  with  the 
malfunctioning component and delay  the  launch of  the crew  if  required.   Another option 
is  to  launch  a  replacement  component  either  using  chemical  or  electric  propulsion 
depending  on  the  mission  schedule.    Finally,  a  replacement  component  could  be  sent 
with the crew when they launch as scheduled. 
 
Mission  planners  do  not  have  these  same  options  if  such  components  are  not  pre-
positioned.    If  everything  is  sent  to  the  destination  at  the  same  time  and  a  mission 
critical  component  malfunctions,  the  only  options  available  are  to  rely  on  a  backup 
component  or  fix  the  malfunctioning  component.    This  requires  that  more  redundancy 
be incorporated into the design of the components used in the mission.  This may result 
in increased overall mission mass, which translates to increased cost. 
 
Finally,  the  risk  of  launching  many  mission  components  using  existing  launch  vehicle 
technology such as EELVs will  likely be  less  than sending  the same cargo using a new 
or partially new heavy-lift launch vehicle. 

6.4.3.1.4.3. Pre-positioning Penalties 
Some drawbacks exist for incorporating pre-positioning into a space exploration mission 
design.    First,  pre-positioning may  require  an  increase  in  the  number  of  required  Earth 
launches.    This  may  increase  the  risk  of  a  launch  failure.    Second,  the  designs  of  the 
pre-positioned  components  will  need  to  accommodate  increased  component  lifetime 
requirements  to account  for an  increased  time of  flight and  the  time between  the arrival 
of the component(s) at the destination and the arrival of the crew.  A final penalty to pre-
positioning  mission  components  is  the  increased  time  required  of  mission  control 
personnel  for  monitoring  and  control  of  pre-positioned  components.    These  personnel 
will  likely  need  to monitor  these  components  for  an  extended  period  of  time  before  the 
launch  of  the  crew.    If  everything  were  launched  at  the  same  time,  less  time  would  be 
required for monitoring mission components. 

6.4.3.1.5. Crew Module Scaling 
Varying  the mission duration and  the number of crew greatly affects  the overall mass of 
the habitable crew vehicle.    It was necessary  to develop a method of accurately scaling 
the habitable crew vehicle to predict the required launch to LEO crew vehicle mass.

What is the required habitable volume 
based on the crew and mission duration?

What is the vehicle mass 
breakdown? 

By  comparing  the  masses  of  various  crew  modules  (Gemini,  Mercury,  Apollo  CM, 
OASIS  CTV  and  Soyuz),  while  holding  the  habitable  volume  constant,  the  various 
architectures  were  compared.    By  answering  the  questions  shown  in  Figure  54,  a  new 
vehicle mass can be obtained. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

What is the relationship between the 
vehicles dimensions and the habitable 
volume? 

Scale each of the vehicles components 
and determine the new vehicle mass 

How does each component 
scale? 

Figure 54: Flowchart of scaling analysis 

 

1.  An equation was developed  for  the habitable volume as a  function of  the number 
of crew and mission duration.  Based on these  inputs, the volume was calculated. 
2.  The  mass  breakdown  of  the  vehicle  components  (i.e.  structure,  avionics, 
communications  equipment,  etc)  is  well  documented  for  existing  crew  vehicles 
and was determined for the Apollo CM and OASIS CEV (see Appendix 9.1.2.) 
3.  Predict  how  each  of  the  vehicle  components  scale  (i.e.  external  surface  area, 
number of crew, etc) 
4.  Based  on  the  known  vehicle  geometries,  when  increasing  the  habitable  volume 
of a vehicle, maintain the relative sizes of specific vehicle dimensions. 
5.  Scale each component and re-calculate the vehicle mass. 

 
It should be noted  that  the heat shield mass was determined  in a separate analysis and 
was not considered  in  this analysis.   Using modern materials and structural analysis on 
the Apollo CM,  the mass might be reduced.   For comparison,  the materials used  for  the 
OASIS  CEV  were  used  for  the Modern  Command Module  (MCM)  and  Crew Operation 
Vehicle  (COV)  structures.    From  a  detailed  analysis  described  in  Appendix  9.1.2., 
Figure 55 was obtained.

The masses shown in Figure 55 do not include a heat shield because a comparison can 
be  made  between  functionally  equivalent  forms.    Details  of  heat  shield  sizing  are 
described in Appendix 9.2.2.7.2.  
 
As  the mission  duration  increases,  the  habitable  volume  increases,  causing  the  vehicle 
surface  area  to  increase  correspondingly,  to  maintain  the  vehicle  proportions.    As 
explained  earlier,  when  the  surface  area  increases,  all  of  the  mass  breakdown 
components  that  scale  with  surface  area  increase.    Since  the  majority  of  the  mass 
breakdown  components  that  were  scaled  for  the  Apollo  CM  scaled  with  the  vehicle 
surface  area,  there  was  a  significant  overall  vehicle  mass  dependence  on  the  mission 
duration  and/or  crew.   When  the mass per  surface area was  reduced  (as was  the  case 
for  the Modern Command Module analysis),  the  influence of mission duration  increased 
the overall mass of the Modern Command Module only slightly (see Figure 55).

Mission  phases  that  are  common  for  both  Moon  and  Mars  EDLA  are  highlighted  in 
Figure 57.  In general, the thin atmosphere of Mars does not allow parachutes to slow a 
spacecraft  sufficiently  for  a  surface  landing.    Still,  use  of  a  parachute  system  does 
reduce  the ∆v  requirements  for  landing.   A  typical Martian EDL  system might  include  a 
conventional  heat  shield,  parachutes,  and  a  final  retrorocket  decelerator.    The  thermal 
protection  and  parachute  systems  can  be  modeled  using  the  equations  of  motion,  as

discussed  in  5.1.4.2.    The  airless  Moon  necessitates  an  all-propulsive  descent  and 
landing.    Thus,  both  Moon  and  Mars  missions  share  a  powered  descent  phase  to 
varying degrees.  Additionally, both missions require a propulsive ascent return stage to 
launch  off  the  planetary  surface.    The  missions  also  have  a  common  Earth  re-entry 
phase  that  includes  aerocapture,  a  parachute  and  parafoil  system,  and  a  final 
lake/coastal-based touchdown (see Section 6.4.2.5.). 

6.4.3.1.6.1. Lander requirements and commonalities 
The  propulsive  ∆v  requirements  for  the  phases  of  lunar  and  Martian  EDLA  are 
summarized in Table 17.

The Martian de-orbit ∆v  involves  transferring  from a 500 km circular orbit  to a 500 km × 
20  km  Mars  transfer  orbit.    The  initial  descent  phase  entails  aeromanuevering  and 
parachute  deployment  that  does  not  require  any  propulsive  ∆v.    The  powered  descent 
phase  includes ± 4.5 km  lateral  translation capability  for dispersion accommodation and 
landing target site redesignation.  The lunar de-orbit maneuver is from a 100 km circular 
orbit  to  a  100  km  ×  17.5  km  transfer  orbit.    The  powered  descent  and  landing  phase 
includes  initiation,  braking,  pitch-up/throttle-down,  and  vertical  descent  to  surface.    The 
Martian  and  lunar  ascent/rendezvous  ∆v  include  boost  and  circularization  at  500  km 
and  100  km  altitudes,  respectively.    To  build  a  sustainable  EDLA  architecture  for  the 
variably  sized  Mars  and  Moon  missions,  the  Lander’s  functionality  requirements  for 
each  mission  type  are  integrated  in  Table  18.    The  commonality  with  the  Lander 
required for the Earth return portion of each mission  is shown  in the figure as well.  This 
architecture  design  has  deliberately  chosen  Lander  designs  such  that  significant 
portions of the designs are common amongst all missions.

Although  significant  commonality  between  Lander  designs  has  been  purposely 
designed  for  this  space  exploration  architecture,  several  differences  between  Lander 
designs  do  exist.    These  differences  are  due  to  the  significant  differences  between  the 
landing  environments  on  the Moon  and Mars.    The  differences  in  ∆V  requirements  and 
Lunar and Martian atmospheres play major roles in determining the final Lander designs 
for  each  destination.    Schematics  for  Earth  return,  Lunar,  and  Martian  Landers  are 
shown below in Figure 58, Figure 59, and Figure 60.

Figure 60:  Martian Lander design 

 

 
The  three  Lander  designs  can  be  seen  to  have  some  identical  components,  some 
similar  components,  and  some  differences.    For  example,  the  crew  capsule  on  top  of 
each of the Landers is identical.  The engines for the various Lander designs are similar 
to  each  other.    The  actual  engine masses  can  be  seen  in  Table  19  in  the  next  section.  
The  differences  among  the  Landers  are  few.    A major  difference  is  the  requirement  for 
floatation  devices  on  the  Earth  return  capsule.    This  is  not  required  for  the  other  two 
Lander  designs.    In  addition,  the  Earth  return  Lander  will  require  a  parafoil  while  the 
other  two Landers do not.   Finally,  the Martian Lander has  increased  complexity due  to 
the  fact  that  it  has  a  deployable  heat  shield  and  landing  structure.    This  is  not  required 
on the other Landers. 

6.4.3.1.6.2. Three-person versus six-person Lander trade study 
A major  decision made  during  the  Lander  design  for  this  project was  to  determine  how 
many crewmembers the Landers should be designed to accommodate.  If missions with 
varying  numbers  of  crew members  are  going  to  be  done,  perhaps  it would  be  better  to 
have  greater  numbers  of  Landers  that  each  accommodate  fewer  crew  members.    On 
the  other  hand,  if most  or  all missions  will  be  done  with  the  same  crew  size,  it may  be 
beneficial to simply design the crew compartment to be common for all missions. 
 
Since  three  and  six-person  crew  sizes  are  being  considered  for  this  project,  a  trade 
study was proposed to weigh the benefits and drawbacks from designing a three-person 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      146              

 

Lander  versus  a  six-person  Lander.   For missions with  a  crew  of  six,  two  three-person-
sized  Landers  would  be  required  to  transport  the  crew  instead  of  one  Lander  to 
accommodate the entire crew. 
 
Table  19  below  is  a  comparison  of  the  Lander  component  masses  required  for  Earth 
return,  lunar, and Martian Lander designs  for  three and six-person crews.   An  important 
assumption made was that the Landers have life support systems capable of supporting 
the crew for several days.

The  last  row  in  Table  19 makes  the  best  argument  for  simply  designing  one  six-person 
Lander if crews of only six are to be used for all missions.  This is because the mass per 
crew  for  six-person-sized  Landers  is  significantly  lower  than  that  of  the  three-person 
Landers.    However,  if  a  crew  of  three  were  to  use  a  six-person  Lander,  this  benefit 
would be lost.  In fact, a significant mass penalty would result from a crew of three using 
a six-person-sized Lander. 
 
A  benefit  from  a  crew  of  less  than  six  people  using  a  six-person  Lander  would  be  the 
option  of  using  the  extra  internal  volume  to  bring  additional  life  support  and  other 
equipment 
for  either  enhancing  mission  capabilities  or  simply  providing  extra 
redundancy to provide additional safety margin for the crew. 
 
For  a  six-person  crew,  a major  benefit  for  using  two  three-person  Landers  as  opposed 
to  using  one  six-person  Lander  is  the  ability  for  a  portion  of  the  crew  to  survive  and 
complete  their  mission  even  if  there  is  an  accident  in  which  a  major  Lander  failure 
results  in  the  loss  of  that  portion  of  the  crew.    If  a  crew  of  six  is  landing  in  one  Lander 
and  the  Lander  fails  and  the  entire  crew  is  lost,  that  would  effectively  end  the  mission 
and  it  would  be  deemed  a  failure.    Having  two  Landers  adds  redundancy  to  mission 
success  by  removing  a  single-point  failure.    If  a  remaining  crew  of  three  were  able  to 
successfully  complete  their  mission  and  return  home,  the  mission  will  most  likely  be 
deemed a success.

6.4.3.1.6.3. Autonomous Landing Systems 
Many  of  the  lunar  and  Martian  mission  architectures  are  dependent  on  the  pre-
positioning  of  cargo  on  the  planetary  surface.    Indeed,  a major  objective  is  to  separate 
cargo  from crew as much as practicable  for  reasons of safety and cost-benefit.   For  the 
crewed  phases  of  the  mission,  the  Landers  have  been  assumed  to  be  partially 
controllable  by  the  astronauts.    For  instance,  on  Apollo  11 Neil  Armstrong  took manual 
control of  the powered descent system when he noticed  the  target  landing site was  in a 
boulder  field.    Unfortunately,  unmanned  cargo  Landers  cannot  rely  on  such  human 
situational  awareness  and  adaptability.    The  autonomous  landing  systems  for  these 
Landers  will  require  a  high  degree  of  accuracy  to  position  cargo  modules  in  close 
proximity,  while  avoiding  terrain  hazards  and  other  modules.    NASA/JPL  Mars 
Exploration  Rover’s  Spirit  successfully  landed  within  its  77  km  long  footprint  at  a 
distance  of  only  9  km  from  its  dead-center  target.    NASA  has  renewed  focus  on 
autonomous  descent  and  terminal  guidance.    As  part  of  NASA’s  New  Millennium 
Program,  the  “Smart”  landing  technology  capabilities  roadmap  is  summarized  in  Figure 
12.    The  roadmap  matches  well  with  the  time-scale  of  developing  the  Moon  and  Mars 
exploration system.

6.4.3.1.7. On-orbit Assembly 
On-orbit assembly  is a difficult  task  in more ways  than one.   Choosing a  launch vehicle, 
selecting  the  timeline  and  determining  the  launch  logistics  for  assembly  are  three 
difficulties of using this method of module assembly. 
 
According to (Larson, 1999), four considerations are  important when designing a launch 
sequence, 
 

1.  Basic  subsystem  functions  –  The  space  elements  must  have  vital  systems 
working  at  all  times  (attitude  and  orbit  control,  electrical  power,  thermal  control, 
communications etc.) 
2.  Configurational  aspects  –  All  orbital  stages  are  space  elements  and  need  an 
analysis of their expected functional requirements 
3.  Launch  system  restrictions  –  There  are  limits  in  terms  of  payload  mass  and 
volume, and launch rates.

      148              

 

4.  Contingency considerations – Ensure  launch  time slips or complete payload  loss 
will  not  be  critical  to  the  space  element.    Failure mode  analysis  and  contingency 
plans have to be established assuming the failure or loss of each item. 

 
From a transportation perspective, it was assumed that the space transportation system 
architecture  does  not  require  the  use  of  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS)  as  an 
assembly  or  return  point.    This  was  done  to  ensure  that  NASA  could  divest  itself  from 
the  ISS  and  STS  to  meet  the  Space  Exploration  goals  within  the  future  budget  cap.  
When  pre-positioning  becomes  paramount  to  a mission  architecture,  the  assumption  of 
vehicle on-orbit assembly is critical to mission success. 
 
On-orbit  assembly  prior  to  crew  arrival  increases  the  safety  of  the  mission.    Once  the 
transfer  vehicle  is  assembled  and  the  crew  is  delivered  to  orbit,  there  will  be  some  on-
orbit  "check-out"  functions  that  the  crew will  need  to  accomplish  to  complete  assembly, 
verify  functionality,  and  prepare  for  injection  to  the  destination.    This may  require  a  few 
days  during  which  the  crew  would  be  exposed  to  a  high  radiation  environment.  
Launching  a  crew  to  a  fully  assembled  vehicle  ensures  that  radiation  exposure  is 
minimized.    This  also  ensures  that  the  vehicle  has  been  correctly  assembled  and 
checked  over  prior  to  crew  arrival.   If  any  problems  occur  during  assembly,  the  vehicle 
is more  readily  accessible,  and  if  problems  occur  during  check-out  the  crew  can  return 
home easily. 
 
Spacecraft  platforming,  reconfigurability,  extensibility,  and  assembly  are  discussed 
elsewhere in the Report.

6.4.3.2.1 Trajectories 
The  lunar  baseline mission  architectures were  evaluated  for  two  trajectories:  one  using 
lunar orbit at a staging point, as discussed in the lunar baseline mission description, and 
one  using  the  Earth-Moon  L1  (EM-L1)  rather  than  lunar  orbit  as  a  staging  point.  The 
different  trajectories  were  compared  in  terms  of  total  mission  mass  in  LEO,  and  the 
results are shown in the figure below.

For the purpose of comparison, all missions segments use the minimum ∆v trajectories, 
employing  a  Hohmann  transfer  where  appropriate.  Also,  calculations  assume  a  lunar 
parking orbit of 100km where applicable, and  include additional ∆v  required  to establish 
and  leave  EM-L1  halo  orbits  where  applicable.  The  appropriate  parameters  to 
reproduce this calculation are summarized in Appendix 9.3.  
 
The  results  shown  for  architectures  using  lunar  orbit  apply  for  lunar  missions  to  any 
latitude  landing site  if a  free-return  trajectory constraint  is not  imposed. They also apply 
to  lunar equatorial  landing sites  if a  free-return  trajectory  is  imposed. The  results shown 
for  architectures  making  use  of  EM-L1  apply  for  missions  to  any  latitude  landing  site, 
regardless  of  free-return  trajectory  constraints.  Because  the  use  of  a  trajectory  utilizing 
the  EM-L1  consistently  results  in  a  greater  mass  in  LEO,  the  baseline  mission  uses 
lunar  orbit  as  a  staging  area.  However,  this  analysis  does  not  include  consideration 
such  as  accessibility  to  high  latitude  landing  sites  when  free-return  trajectory  or 
scheduling  constraints  are  imposed.  These  issues  are  dealt  with  separately  in  Section 
6.4.3.2.3.

6.4.3.2.3 Lunar Orbit vs. EM-L1 
There are three primary factors influencing whether to use lunar orbit or the Earth-Moon 
L1  point  in  a  lunar mission  architecture:  choice  of  landing  sites,  free-return  option,  and 
scheduling.  
 
If  lunar missions are  targeting sites within plus or minus  five degrees of  the equator, an 
architecture  utilizing  a  lunar  equatorial  orbit  provides  the  option  of  a  free-return 
trajectory.    In  addition,  it  offers  the  ability  to  descend  from  and  ascent  to  lunar  orbit 
every two hours.  
 
Lunar  missions  that  do  not  target  equatorial  sites  can  achieve  intermediate  inclination 
and polar  lunar orbits by making minor  targeting maneuvers early  in  the  trajectory. This 
targeting  requires  a  negligible  amount  of  ∆v,  however  it  removes  the  possibility  of  a 
free-return  trajectory.  Making  use  of  intermediate  inclination  and  polar  orbits  also 
introduces  scheduling  constraints.  For  example,  from  an  intermediate  lunar  orbit,  a 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      151              

 

spacecraft can only descend, ascent, or enter a return to Earth trajectory every 27 days. 
From  a  polar  orbit,  a  spacecraft  can  descend  to  or  ascent  from  an  intermediate  or 
equatorial  landing  site  every  14  days,  and  can  descend  to  or  ascend  from  a  polar 
landing  site  every  two  hours.  An  opportunity  to  enter  a  return  to  Earth  trajectory  from 
polar orbit occurs every 14 days (Larson, 2002).   
 
If a  lunar mission  is targeting a non-equatorial  landing site and a  free return trajectory  is 
deemed necessary,  two possible solutions exist. The  first solution  is  to make use of  the 
Earth-Moon  L1  (EM-L1).  The  second  solution  is  to  enter  a  lunar  equatorial  orbit  and 
then initiate a propulsive maneuver to change orbital planes. 
 
The  EM-L1  provides  access  to  all  lunar  landing  sites  with  the  option  of  a  free-return 
trajectory if no burn is initiated at the EM-L1, and the continuous ability to descend from, 
ascend  to,  and  enter  a  return  to  Earth  trajectory  using  the  EM-L1.  However,  an 
architecture  utilizing 
the  EM-L1  requires  an 
increase 
in 
total  mission  ∆V  of 
approximately 11%  (plus or minus 2% depending on  the  trajectory used) and  four extra 
propulsive burns as compared to an architecture using lunar orbit.  
 
The  second  option,  entering  a  lunar  equatorial  orbit  and  then  initiating  a  propulsive 
maneuver  to  change  orbital  planes,  is  expensive  in  terms  of  total  mission  ∆  v.  If  the 
lunar mission  is  targeting  a  landing  site  no more  than  39°  from  the  lunar  equator,  then 
the  total  increase  in  ∆  v  is  less  than  that  required  to  use  the  EM-L1.  However,  if  the 
landing  site  is  greater  than  39°  from  the  lunar  equator,  using  the  EM-L1  is  less 
expensive in terms of ∆ v.  
 
The advantages of using  lunar orbit are clear  for missions  targeting equatorial sites, but 
the  best  option  is  not  clear  for  missions  targeting  non-equatorial  landing  sites. 
Unfortunately, as described  in the discussion of landing sites, many  interesting sites are 
not  located  along  the  equator.  Thus, mission  planners must  weigh  the  importance  of  a 
free-return  trajectory  and  scheduling  constraints  in  terms  of  increased  ∆V  to  determine 
the appropriate architecture.  
 
While  total  mission  ∆v  provides  a  general  means  of  comparing  lunar  orbit  and  EM-L1, 
mission  architecture  can  play  a  significant  role  in  determining  the  influence  this  metric 
has  on  the  total mission mass  in  LEO.  For  example,  Figure  63  shows  the  total mission 
mass in LEO assuming a free-return trajectory requirement for the manned segments of 
a mission  to a  lunar pole. While EM-L1 may be beneficial  in  terms of  total mission ∆v  if 
the  mission  is  targeting  a  polar  landing  site  such  as  the  South  Pole  Aitken  Basin,  the 
total  mission  mass  in  LEO  may  be  smaller  for  a  mission  using  lunar  orbit  with  a  plane 
change  if a certain mission architecture  is utilized.  In  this case, only short stay missions 
save  a  significant  amount  of mass  in  LEO  by  using EM-L1. Medium  and  extended  stay 
lunar missions  targeting a pole  require approximately  the same amount of mass  in LEO 
whether  they use EM-L1 or carry out a plane change  in  lunar orbit. These  results occur 
because  short-stay  missions  do  not  use  pre-positioning,  while  medium  and  extended 
stay missions do. The use of pre-positioning  in  these architectures  reduces  the amount 
of  crewed  module  mass  that  must  undergo  a  plane  change  in  lunar  orbit.  Also,  these

results  occur  only  for  the  baseline  lunar  missions  described  in  Section  4.2  analyzed 
using the specific mission parameters found in Appendix 9.3.

6.4.3.2.4 Reusability of the Lunar Lander 
The  proximity  of  the  Earth  and  Moon,  and  the  likelihood  of  multiple  lunar  missions  to 
serve as  test beds  for  future Mars missions  raise  the question: what benefit,  if any, can 
be accrued through use of a reusable Lunar Lander?  
 
A trade study was performed to compare a non-reusable Lander to a reusable Lander in 
terms  of  cumulative  mass  in  LEO  required  to  pre-position  and  ready  one  three-person 
Lander in lunar orbit. The results are shown in the figure below.

Figure 64: Comparison of a non-reusable and reusable Lunar Lander 

 
The  mass  in  LEO  for  a  non-reusable  Lander  was  calculated  assuming  electric 
propulsion  to  pre-position  one  Lunar  Lander  with  enough  chemical  fuel  to  descend  to 
and  ascend  from  the  lunar  surface.  The  mass  in  LEO  for  a  reusable  Lander  was 
calculated  assuming  electric  propulsion  to  pre-position  one  wet  Lunar  Lander  for  the 
first  mission.  Mass  in  LEO  of  subsequent  missions  was  calculated  assuming  electric 
propulsion  to  transport  fuel  for  the  pre-positioned  Lander’s  descent  and  ascent. 
Because a reusable Lander will  likely have a greater mass  than a non-reusable Lander, 
a mass penalty was included in the study. For example, a 30% mass penalty means the 
calculations  shows  that an expendable Lunar Lander has a mass 30% greater  than  the 
non-reusable Lander mass.  
 
Figure  64  shows  that  if  a  reusable  Lander  can  be  designed  with  only  a  30%  mass 
penalty,  then  a  reusable  Lander  is  beneficial  after  only  two  uses. However,  if  the mass 
of  a  reusable  Lander  is  nearly  double  the  mass  of  a  non-reusable  one,  then  five 
missions are necessary before benefit is accrued.  
 
While  Figure  64  suggests  that  a  reusable  Lunar  Lander  provides  benefits  in  terms  of 
mass in LEO, this study does not include the mass in LEO for tools and extra equipment 
to  service  the  Lunar  Lander  when  necessary.  Also,  mass  in  LEO  as  a  comparison 
metric  does  not  capture  all  cost  associated  with  designing  and  building  a  reusable 
spacecraft;  there  are  additional  development  and  operational  costs  not  captured  in  this 
study.  

6.4.3.3 Mars 
A  human  mission  to  Mars  is  an  enormous  undertaking  that  poses  significant  design 
constraints.    There  are  many  factors  that  have  influenced  the  baseline  mission  and 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      154              

 

many more  that will emerge.    In order  to understand  these design constraints, a deeper 
investigation  into  the  factors  that  influence  the  trajectory  and  the  mission  must  be 
conducted. 

6.4.3.3.1 The Mars Environment and Design Effects 
The  Mars  environment  will  directly  affect  the  design  of  any  mission  to  the  planet.  
Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  examine  the  environmental  attributes  and  determine  how 
they impact the design. 

6.4.3.3.1.1 Environmental Factors 
Martian seasonal change can drastically affect in weather and the working environment.  
The  northern  hemispheres’  spring  is  94  sols  long  and  autumn  is  143  sols.  The Martian 
day, or sol,  is 24 hours and 39.6 minutes  long.       Gravity on Mars will affect all activities 
on  the  surface  as well  as  the  health  and well-being  of  the  crew.  The  gravity  on Mars  is 
approximately 3.758 m/s2, which is slightly more than one-third of Earth’s surface gravity. 
 
Landing  site  selection  will  depend  on  a  number  of  factors;  altitude  and  site 
characteristics will be paramount.  Altitudes range from +27 km on Olympus Mons to –4 
km  in  Hellas  Basin.    The  southern  atmosphere  is  at  an  overall  higher  elevation  +4km 
than the northern plains –2 km.  There are three distinct regions on the planet:  cratered 
terrain, the volcanic provinces of Tharsis and Elysium, and the lowland plains. 
 
Three types of planetary surface material exist: rocks, regolith, and fines.  Mars’ surface 
material  can  shield  against  radiation  and  micro-meteoroids.    Thus,  about  0.5  m  of 
Martian surface materials should be enough  to stop the primary dose  from solar particle 
events, although you could use several meters to prevent more radiation. 
 
Previous  excursions  to  Mars,  such  as  VL-1,  VL-2,  and  Sojourner  spacecraft  exceeded 
operation  lifetime.    Thus,  planners  should  not  expect  long-term  chemical  degradation  if 
the system is properly designed. 
 
Atmospheric  conditions  will  have  the  biggest  impact  on  mission  design.    Weather  and 
atmospheric composition will drive all surface operations.   Wind speeds vary by season 
and  are  lowest  during  the  summer  (around  2  m/s  –  7  m/s),  and  reach  speeds  around 
5m/s  –  10m/s  during  autumn.    Global  dust  storms,  which  can  reach  speeds  of  30 m/s, 
occur  in  the  southern  spring  and  summer  (Hamilton,  2001).  The  atmosphere  is 
composed  of:  95.32%  carbon  dioxide  (CO2),  2.7%  nitrogen  (N2),  1.6%  argon  (Ar), 
0.13% oxygen (O2), 0.03% water (H2O), and 0.00025% neon (Ne).   
 
The severity of  the Martian  temperature will have a major effect on both mission design 
and planetary surface operations.  The average recorded temperature on Mars is -63° C 
(-81° F) with a maximum temperature of 20° C (68° F) and a minimum of -140° C (-220° 
F).    Barometric  pressure  varies  at  each  landing  site  on  a  semiannual  basis.  Carbon 
dioxide,  the major constituent of  the atmosphere,  freezes out  to  form an  immense polar 
cap, alternately at each pole. The carbon dioxide  forms a great cover of snow and  then

      155              

 

evaporates again with the coming of spring in each hemisphere. When the southern cap 
was  largest,  the  mean  daily  pressure  observed  by  Viking  Lander  1  was  as  low  as  6.8 
millibars; at other  times of  the year  it was as high as 9.0 millibars. The pressures at  the 
Viking  Lander  2  site  were  between  7.3  and  10.8  millibars.  In  comparison,  the  average 
pressure  of  the  Earth  is  1000  millibars.    Thus,  the  comparatively  low  barometric 
pressures will pose serious design constraints and limitations.   

 6.4.3.3.1.2 Design Guidelines 
The Mars environment will direct  the design of any mission  to  the planet.   Thus, having 
examined  some  of  the  environmental  factors,  it  is  necessary  to  understand  how  they 
impact the mission design. . 
 
Examining  the  environmental  conditions  given  above  we  can  infer  some  general 
conclusions.    The  soil  can  support  Landers,  stations,  and  rovers,  however  footpad  and 
wheel  dimensions must  be  sized  according  to  load.   Structures  can  be  anchored  in  the 
soil  for additional stability against seismic events, wind, etc.    In addition,  the soil can be 
used  to  provide  some  level  of  radiation  and  environmental  shielding.    The  effective 
shielding  against  radiation  is  0.5  m  to  3  m.    The  effective  shielding  against 
micrometeoroids and orbital debris is 0.5 m. 
 
The  design  of  equipment  must  account  for  the  harsh  environment  and  atmospheric 
conditions  on  Mars.    The  physical  effect  and  chemical  effect  of  soil  and  dust  on 
mechanical  and  electrical  systems  is  unknown,  however  mechanical  devices  will  need 
lubrication and sealing.   
 
Using  solar  energy  to  provide  a  power  supply  is  advantageous  on  Mars.    Mars  has 
longer  days  and  no  significant  eclipses. 
  The  surface  can  be  used  as  an 
electromagnetic  ground.    In  addition,  the  local  geology  contains  usable  quantities  of 
critical resources such as CO2 and water from the atmosphere (Larson, 2003).   

6.4.3.3.1.3 Landing Site Selection 
 
There  are  certain  criteria  for  landing  site  selection  that  is  dictated  by  both  the  mission 
objectives  and  the  planet’s  environment.    The  latitude  should  be  between  30-600S  for 
power  constraints  and  poleward  of  300  for  near  surface  water.    Positioning  the  landing 
site  near  fluvial  activity, where  subsurface water may  be  expected  (i.e.  gully  locations), 
sites  of  past  seismic  activity.    The  elevation  should  be  at  a maximum  of  1.3  km  above 
the  Mars’  datum.    The  site  should  be  a  smooth  flat  plain,  relatively  devoid  of  large 
obstacles and the landing ellipse must fit within the flat plateau region.   
 
The following is a list of potential sites that satisfy the above criteria: 
 
• Dao Vallis (33°S, 267°W) 
• Gorgonum Chaos (37°S, 168°W) 
• Nirgal Valles (30°S, 39°W) 
• Elysium Planitia (37°N, 252°W)

6.4.3.3.2 Enabling Technologies 
Although  a  human  mission  to  Mars  may  be  accomplished  without  developing  new 
technologies,  to  develop  a  sustainable  initiative,  it  will  be  quite  beneficial  to  investigate 
some  or  all  of  these  technologies.    Some  of  these  technologies  will  allow  for  a  lower 
mass  to  be  launched  from  Earth,  while  others  will  allow  for  a  semi-permanent 
infrastructure  on  Mars  to  remain  relatively  self-sufficient.    A  review  of  some  of  the 
important technologies follows. 

6.4.3.3.2.1 ISPP 
In-situ  propellant  production  (ISPP)  promises  to  be  a  viable  new  technology  that  will 
have  a  significant  effect  on  missions  to  Mars  and  the  corresponding  mission 
architectures.    The  Mars  Direct  plan  developed  primarily  by  Robert  Zubrin  in  the  late 
1990’s  introduced  a  realistic  ISPP  scheme,  which  makes  use  of  a  readily  accessible 
resource:  the  Martian  atmosphere  (Zubrin,  1996).    ISPP  would  allow  propellant  to  be 
produced  on  Mars  for  the  ascent  to  Mars  orbit  or  even  for  the  return  journey  to  Earth, 
thus  dramatically  reducing  the  required  IMLEO.    Before  the  Mars  Direct  proposal, 
mission  plans  estimated  the  IMLEO  to  be  on  the  order  of  1500  metric  tonnes  or  ten 
times  that  of  the  Apollo missions.    By  utilizing  ISPP,  the  IMLEO  estimate  is  reduced  to 
250  tonnes  for Mars Direct and 450  tonnes  for a slightly scaled up version, Mars Semi-
Direct,  with  a  crew  of  6,  as  presented  in  NASA’s  1997  Design  Reference  Mission 
(Heidmann, 2003). 
 
The ISPP method, which produces methane/oxygen (Isp ~370s), as described by Zubrin, 
is  still  the  most  widely  recognised  possibility  for  Mars.    This  method  entails  sending 
hydrogen  feedstock,  a  small  nuclear  power  plant,  and  a  chemical  processing  plant  to 
Mars  in  advance  of  the  human  crew.    The  ISPP  plant  is  autonomously  set  up  to  begin 
fuel production.   
 
The  production  of  fuel  is  performed  by  the  Sabatier  process,  which  converts  carbon 
dioxide  from  the  Martian  atmosphere  into  methane  and  oxygen  via  the  following 
reaction: 

4H2 + CO2 (cid:198) CH4 + 2H2O. 
 
The resulting water is electrolysed into hydrogen and oxygen.  The oxygen is stored and 
the  hydrogen  is  recycled  back  into  the  Sabatier  reaction.    This  series  of  reactions 
provides a mass leverage (produced fuel mass to imported fuel mass ratio) of 12, which 
can  be  increased  further  by  simply  improving  the  methane/oxygen  molar  ratio  to  that 
required  for  propellant,  by  utilizing  a      Reverse  Water-Gas  Shift  (RWGS)  to  generate 
oxygen as follows: 

CO2 + H2 (cid:198) CO + H2O. 
 
Using  this  process,  the  mass  leverage  is  increased  to  20  (Heidmann,  2003).    Yet 
another  option  is  to  use  RWGS  to  produce  methanol  that  has  a  lower  Isp  than  the 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      157              

 

methane  propellant  but  uses  a  more  efficient  process  and  does  not  require  cryogenic 
storage.    Since  methanol-based  propellants  have  a  relatively  simple  engine  design, 
such  a  fuel  may  be  very  useful  for  surface  power  such  as  rover  fuel  cells  (Heidmann, 
2003). 
 
The  development  of  ISPP  technologies  requires  several  obstacles  to  be  surmounted.  
Considerations of  the Martian environment, such as dust and  reduced gravity will affect 
the functioning of the chemical processing plant and nuclear power plant.  The design of 
these  components  will  have  to  be  carefully  implemented  such  that  these  factors  are 
taken  into  consideration.    Secondly,  ISPP  will  rely  heavily  on  autonomous  systems.    A 
spacecraft  will  have  to  survive  the  hazards  of  launch  and  interplanetary  travel,  land 
successfully,  deploy  its  various  components,  and  begin  to  produce  power  even  before 
the  chemical  processing  plant  can  begin  to  function.    Furthermore,  autonomous 
verification  and  communication  of  the  status  of  propellant  production will  be  required  to 
validate  the  functioning  of  ISPP.    The  above  obstacles  suggest  that  the  first  human 
mission  to  Mars  not  rely  on  ISPP,  but  instead  verify  and  test  the  technology  such  that 
future missions can benefit from this technology.   

6.4.3.3.2.2 ISRU 
In-situ  resource utilization  (ISRU) has  the potential advantage of producing a significant 
savings  in  both  mass  and  cost  for  Mars  missions.    Concerns  about  developing  in-situ 
resources  include technological readiness of many processes, their safety and reliability, 
and  their  sometimes  serious  effects  on  mission  design.    However,  with  the  idea  of 
developing a sustainable exploration, some examples of potentially advantageous ISRU 
are given below. 
 
First, the use of solar radiation for power generation could provide a sustainable surface 
infrastructure  with  a  low  cost,  reliable  power  supply.    Also,  the  low  gravity  and  near-
vacuum environment  is good  for most material processing.   To  this end, carbon dioxide 
components can be used not only  for  life support, but  for  the creation of plastics, which 
allows  for  the  return  to  commercial beneficiaries.   Nitrogen  from  the atmosphere will be 
added to the air in the life support systems and as well as the soil in a greenhouse.  The 
soil  itself  can  be  used  for  radiation  shielding,  and  can  be  melted  and  sintered  for  the 
purpose  of  construction.   Any metal  extracted  from  the  soil  can  be  used  in  construction 
(Larson,  2003).    In  addition,  water  ice  permafrost  can  be  extracted  from  the  soil  to  be 
used  in  propellant  as  well  as  life  support.    These  in-situ  resources  can  be  utilized  to 
enable a low cost, semi-permanent infrastructure on Mars. 

6.4.3.3.2.3 Closed-Loop Life Support Systems 
To  support  a  long-duration  mission,  it  will  be  necessary  to  recycle  resources  from  the 
life  support  system.    The  closure-level  of  a  life  support  system  is  the  percentage  of 
waste  products  that  are  recovered  as  useful  resources.    A  high  closure  level  requires 
less  re-supply  but  may  also  add  cost  for  technology  development,  increase  power 
requirements, and increase complexity.

A life support system must provide resources for meals, hygiene, medical activities, and 
science  experiments.    The  primary  consumables  required  for  astronauts  are  water, 
oxygen, and  food.   Four major  life support  functions exist: 1) managing  the atmosphere 
to maintain nitrogen-oxygen pressures, provide a comfortable temperature and humidity, 
and  remove contaminants such as carbon dioxide  “bubbles,” 2) distributing water  to  the 
crew  and  processing  waste  water,  3)  treating  waste  and  recycling  consumables,  4) 
produce  and  process  food.    For  missions  longer  than  a  few  weeks,  regenerable 
technologies  will  be  utilized  to  remove  CO2  and  recover  wastewater.    For  missions  on 
the  order  of  several  months,  it  will  be  necessary  to  also  employ  oxygen-regeneration 
technologies. 
 
In  general,  food,  water,  and  air  represent  most  of  the  mass  of  a  life  support  system.  
Closed-loop  life support technologies (also known as advanced  life support or ALS) can 
significantly  reduce  water  and  clothing  masses,  where  the  clothing  mass  is  reduced  at 
the  expense  of  an  aqueous  laundry.    This  is  a  viable  trade  for  long-duration  missions 
(Hanford,  2003).    Food  mass  is  difficult  to  decrease  without  the  addition  of  a 
biochamber  component, and  this  is  currently not  very practical  for  transfer  vehicles due 
to  the  large volume and power consumption  rate  required  to grow plants. The  results of 
a NASA  study  devoted  to measuring  the  potential  utility  of ALS  development  show  that 
in terms of Equivalent System Mass (ESM) – a total mass metric that  incorporates such 
factors  as  power  consumption  and  volume  –  ALS  techniques  are  most  beneficial  for 
reducing  the  mass  of  a  surface  habitat  module.  Here  it  is  estimated  that  ALS  would 
result  in  mass  savings  of  approximately  31%  over  life  support  technologies  used  on 
board the ISS (Hanford, 2003). 
 
One element of the trade space for closed-loop life support systems is whether or not to 
employ  such  a  system  for  the  pressurized  rovers  that  astronauts  will  use  to  travel 
hundreds  of  kilometers  on  the  surface  of  the  Moon  and  Mars.    Pressurized  rovers 
provide  a  shirtsleeve  environment  with  a  breathable  atmosphere—oxygen  is  provided 
and CO2 and water vapor are removed.  It is possible to reclaim all CO2 and water vapor 
for  recycling.    However,  the  mass  and  power  requirements  of  such  a  system  may 
exceed the mass of the consumables saved on any one excursion or even multiple trips.  
Given  that  roughly  1000  kg  of  equipment  is  required  to  recover  1  kg  of  nitrogen  and 
oxygen per crewmember per day, nearly 50 week-long surface trips by three astronauts 
would  be  required  to  gain  mass  savings  from  a  closed  life  support  system  in  a 
pressurized  rover.   Whether  utilized  in  rovers,  or  just  in  the  stationary  surface  habitats, 
closed life support systems allow for a semi-permanent infrastructure to be sustained.  

6.4.3.3.2.4 Nuclear Propulsion 
Nuclear  Propulsion  is  a  relatively  well-developed  area  of  research  that  can  provide 
significant mass  savings  in  LEO.    The  safety  concerns  of  launching  a  nuclear  powered 
engine  must  be  balanced  with  the  benefits  of  having  a  high  specific  impulse  form  of 
propulsion. 
 
Similar  to  electric  propulsion,  nuclear  propulsion  can  provide  constant  thrust,  unlike 
chemical  propulsion.   However,  the  thrust  is  significantly  higher  than  electric  propulsion

and  allows  for  competitive  transit  times.    This  decreases  the  major  concern  involved 
with  the  use  of  electric  propulsion,  which  is  the  significant  transit  times  during  the 
outward  spiral  through  the  Van  Allen  belts.    A  nuclear  propulsion  engine  can  provide  a 
specific impulse on the order of 960 sec (Walberg, 1993).

Figure 65:  Comparison of nuclear propulsion to chemical propulsion for baseline trajectories 
 
Assuming  that  a  nuclear  propulsion  engine  is  employed  for  the  human  travel  to  and 
from  Mars  and  that  pre-positioning  is  still  provided  by  electric  propulsion  (since  flight 
times are  less of a concern), Figure 65 shows  that a significant decrease  in  initial mass 
in LEO exists when nuclear propulsion  is utilized.   Thus,  to develop a  truly efficient and 
sustainable  transportation  system  to Mars,  and  beyond,  nuclear  propulsion  will  provide 
a low mission mass cost, and therefore, warrants further consideration (Walberg, 1993).   

6.4.3.3.2.5 Power for Planetary Surface Operations 
Power  requirements  for a Mars mission are projected  to be between 25 kW-100 kW  for 
an  initial  surface  habitat,  10  kW  for  a  piloted  rover,  and  160  kW  for  a  habitat  that 
process  in-situ  resources.    Any  sustainable  exploration  architecture  must  meet  these 
requirements  in  an  economical  manner.    Power  systems  on  Mars  face  a  variety  of 
challenges:  12.3  hour  nights,  variations  in  the  day/night  cycle  by  season  and  latitude, 
and low temperatures (especially, during the night and winter).  Atmospheric dust poses 
a  threat  to  solar  arrays  on  long-duration  missions.    In  such  cases,  scrubbers  may  be 
needed  to  limit degradation.   The primary challenge  to power systems on  the surface of 
the  Moon  is  the  354  hour  night.    Other  design  issues  arise  from  lunar  dust  that  is

      160              

 

produced  from  normal  surface  operations,  structural  issues  in  a  one-sixth  Earth  g 
environment, and daytime temperatures, which can exceed 100˚C (Landis, 1999).     
 
The  primary  electrical  power  source  on  the  surface  of  the  Moon  and  Mars  may  come 
from  a  combination  of  solar  cells,  batteries,  radioisotope  thermoelectric  generators 
(RTG),  or  nuclear  reactors.    Photovoltaic  power  sources  provide  a  long-term  source  of 
power  at  an  estimated  degradation  rate.    For  relatively  short  manned  missions  in  the 
past,  energy  storage  systems  have  proved  sufficient  to  power  habitual  modules  (e.g., 
Mercury,  Gemini,  Apollo,  STS).    Nuclear  power  sources  provide  a  long-term  source  of 
power  and  are  appropriate  for missions  operating  with  little  sunlight  (e.g.,  polar  regions 
of Mars, lunar nights). 
 
The  principal  metric  for  evaluating  solar  and  nuclear  power  sources  is  specific  power 
(watts  per  kilogram).    Photovoltaic  specific  power  ranges  from  25-250 W/kg while RTG 
specific power  ranges  from 5-20 W/kg.   For a Mars mission  requiring 100 kW of power, 
this  translates  to  400-4000  kg  of  solar  arrays  or  5000-20000  kg  of  RTG.    However, 
nuclear  power  outperforms  solar  cells  in  terms  of  radiation  hardness,  stability, 
maneuverability,  shadowing  sensitivity,  and  obstruction  of  view.    In  fact,  the  US  has 
flown 44 RTGs and one nuclear reactor to provide power for 25 different space systems 
since  1961.    Advocates  of  nuclear  power  observe  that  all  US  nuclear  power  sources 
flown have met  their specified requirements and allowed many extended missions to be 
performed. 
 
Nuclear power offers the greatest flexibility for human solar system exploration because 
of  its utility  in virtually any space environment.  Given the likelihood of extended Martian 
missions and  the construction of a  lunar base  that will  require electricity during  the  long 
lunar nights, photovoltaic sources are not optimal.   
 
One  option  that  would  meet  initial  power  requirements  and  provide  plenty  of  room  for 
extensibility  is  the  deployment  of  a  nuclear  reactor.    NASA  is  developing  a  nuclear 
reactor  called  the  SP-100,  which  provides  825  kW  at  a  specific  power  of  41  with  a 
lifetime  working  at  full  power  of  around  7  years.    Baseline  versions  of  the  SP-100 
provide  100  kW  with  a  specific  power  of  30  (3000  kg),  50%  less  mass  than  the  best 
RTG projections.   
 
With  nuclear  reactors,  it  is  necessary  to  shield  the  crew  from  radiation.    This  shielding 
makes  up  a  significant  fraction  of  the  power  systems  overall  mass.    Lunar  or  Martian 
soil may be employed to reduce the shielding materials transported from Earth.  Launch 
pad  safety  is  of  utmost  importance  when  dealing  with  nuclear  reactors  and  it  may  be 
necessary  to  launch  the  reactor  in  an  un-powered  state  to  minimize  radiation.    Of 
course,  obtaining  permits  and  completing  environmental  impact  statements  for  nuclear 
reactors add cost and may delay program schedules.  
 
For  redundancy and safety,  it  is optimal  to have a back-up power system.   Solar arrays 
could accomplish  this  task.   Although  they would not provide all of  the power necessary 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      161              

 

for  the  entire  spacecraft,  they  would  provide  enough  electricity  for  emergency  life 
support. 

6.4.3.3.2.6 Agriculture on Mars 
In  space,  the more material  you  discard,  the more  you  have  to  bring with  you,  thus  the 
longer  the  trip,  the  more  Herculean  the  logistics  requirements  become.    Human 
missions  to Mars will most  certainly  have  one main  design  characteristic:  a  closed-loop 
life  support  system  that  includes  plants  and  microorganisms  (bio-regenerative).    The 
most likely way to grow plants on Mars is the design of a greenhouse.   
 
Significant  attention  must  be  paid  to  the  rather  extreme  conditions  of  Mars.    These 
conditions  include  the  soil  chemistry,  the  gravity  field,  radiation,  and  temperature.  
Special  kind  of  glass  that  can  allow  in  light  by  filter  harmful  radiation  will  be  required.   
An  alternative  to  this  would  be  to  utilize  solar  arrays  to  provide  power  for  the  lights 
inside  the  greenhouse  and  to  generate  the  temperatures  necessary.    In  addition,  extra 
nitrogen, along with various other chemicals will be added to the regolith (Cowing, 2002). 
 
Along  with  providing  crew  with  food,  the  plants  would  provide  a  secondary  use  as 
natural  carbon  scrubbers  for  breathable  air.  This  technology  is  highly  capable  and  is 
easily  testable  on  Earth  and  on  the  precursor  missions  to  the  Moon.    Due  to 
infrastructure  cost,  this  technology would  be more  useful  for  the medium  and  extended 
missions,  and  thus  will  increase  in  importance  as  we  transition  to  a  semi-permanent 
infrastructure.  

6.4.3.3.3 Mission Architectures 
In order to develop a baseline mission scenario, both the architecture of the mission and 
the choice of trajectory must be considered.  When referring to the mission architecture, 
we  are  investigating  the  sequencing  of  events  and  the  main  form  to  function 
relationships  that  will  guide  the  mission  design.    To  compare  different  mission 
architectures a nominal  trajectory  is assumed.   For an accurate comparison, all specific 
impulses are assumed  to be 425 sec, and all engines have a structural  factor of 0.1.    In 
addition,  all  pre-positioning  is  performed  assuming  electric  propulsion  with  a  specific 
power of 150 W/kg, an efficiency of 0.7 and a specific impulse of 3200 sec. 
 
Figure  66,  shows  the  comparison  between  different  mission  architectures,  assuming  a 
short-stay mission.   For each mission architecture, all maneuvers at Mars are powered, 
and  a  direct  entry  at  Earth  is  assumed.    In  addition,  all  missions  assume  a  surface 
habitat  is pre-positioned.   The  following  is a brief description of each mission according 
to the labels given in Figure 66.  A NOVA mission refers to a direct entry at Mars without 
orbit  insertion.   A Mars orbit  rendezvous  (MOR)  is an Apollo-class architecture  in which 
separate Landers are carried from Earth.  The transfer vehicle enters Mars orbit and the 
crew uses the Landers to travel to and return from the Martian surface.  The MOR2 and 
MOR3  architectures  have  a  similar  design,  but  allow  for  the  pre-positioning  of  the 
Landers  and  pre-positioning  of  the  Landers  and  return  fuel,  respectively.    Figure  66 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      162              

 

confirms  that  a  Mars  orbit  rendezvous,  with  pre-positioning  of  the  Landers,  surface 
habitat, and return fuel is the most mass efficient way to perform the transfer.

MOR3 was chosen as the baseline architecture to decrease the IMLEO.  This allows for 
a  more  robust  design  that  can  carry  greater  payload  and  produce  a  more  sustainable 
transportation  system  architecture.    However,  since  MOR2  has  only  a  slightly  higher 
IMLEO, if through testing on the Moon, or for just safety concerns, pre-positioning of the 
return  fuel  is eliminated  for  the  first  few Mars missions,  then MOR2 could easily replace 
the  baseline  architecture  with  few  changes  to  the  rest  of  the  baseline  mission  design.  
However,  for  a  sustainable  architecture,  pre-positioning  of  the  return  fuel  will  provide  a 
significant  benefit  as  the  missions  progress,  and  therefore  is  chosen  as  the  baseline 
design.        

6.4.3.3.4 Mars Trajectories 
Having shown that a Mars orbit rendezvous with pre-positioning of both the Landers and 
the fuel is a mass-efficient architecture, different trajectories were evaluated.  In order to 
compare  trajectories,  a  baseline  architecture  was  assumed  for  each  comparison.    For 
each  trajectory,  the  Mars  Transfer  Vehicle  (MTV),  with  crew,  departs  from  LEO, 
transfers to Mars, and injects into a 1-sol Martian orbit.  The crew transfers into two pre-
positioned  landing vehicles and descends  to  the Martian surface.   Once on  the surface, 
the  crew  will  live  in  a  separate  habitation,  which  has  been  pre-positioned  with  the 
relevant  consumables  for  the  surface  stay.    At  the  end  of  the  surface  stay,  the  landing 
vehicles  ascend  and  dock  with  the  transfer  vehicle.    In  addition,  the  transfer  vehicle 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      163              

 

docks  with  the  return  fuel.    The  crew  returns  to  Earth  in  the  transfer  vehicle,  leaving 
behind  the  landing  vehicles  in  Martian  orbit.    Upon  Earth  return,  the  transfer  vehicle 
injects into Earth orbit and the crew transfers into two Earth return capsules.  In order to 
accurately  compare  different  trajectories,  the  specific  impulses  of  all  chemical  engines 
are  assumed  to  be  425  seconds,  the  structural  factor  is  assumed  to  be  0.1,  and  the 
payload  to  initial mass  factor  for aerobraking  is assumed  to be 0.15.   All pre-positioning 
is accomplished by an electric propulsion engine with  the same characteristics as  listed 
in Section 6.4.3.1.4.   
 
Figure  67  compares  an  Opposition-class  mission  with  and  without  a  Venus  fly-by 
maneuver  during  one  direction  of  transit.    In  addition,  both  types  of  missions  are 
compared with and without utilizing aerobraking.  As can be seen in Figure 67, without a 
Venus  fly-by,  the  opposition  class  mission,  even  employing  aerobraking  at  both  Earth 
and Mars  is prohibitive,  for  the above described mission.   The addition of  the Venus  fly-
by  maneuver  lowers  the  required  initial  mass  in  LEO  (IMLEO)  to  a  reasonable  value, 
especially  with  aerobraking,  for  only  a  small  increase  in  time  of  flight.    Other  issues 
remain in question for this maneuver, such as radiation exposure due to the closer pass 
to the Sun.  However, from a strictly mass related standpoint, a short-stay mission is not 
possible without a Venus fly-by.

Figure  68  displays  a  comparison  between  different  trajectories  for  an  extended-stay 
mission.  As we can see  in Figure 68, aerobraking significantly reduces IMLEO for each 
mission.    An  all-propulsive  maneuver  yields  a  prohibitively  high  IMLEO  for  a  fast 
transfer; however employing aerobraking makes this class of missions feasible.

Figure 68:  Comparison of Conjunction-class missions 

 
According  to Figure 68,  the  time of  flight  for  the  fast  transfer  is only slightly shorter  than 
that  of  the  regular  conjunction  class mission,  and  requires  a  greater  IMLEO.   However, 
the  travel  time  is  significantly  shorter  for  a  fast  transfer  then  for  a  conjunction  class 
mission.  Since the travel time is important for other considerations, such as zero gravity 
and radiation exposure during flight, and since when aerobraking is employed, the initial 
mass  in LEO  is only  slightly higher  than  that of a  regular  conjunction  class mission,  the 
fast transfer is chosen as the trajectory for an extended stay mission.   
 
Figure  69,  summarizes  the  IMLEO  requirements  for  the  feasible  mission  designs:  
Opposition-class  trajectory  with  Venus  fly-by,  and  fast  transfer.    Once  again,  we  see 
that  aerobraking  yields  a  significant  reduction  in  initial  mass  in  LEO.    If  we  refer  to 
Figure  67  and  Figure  68,  we  notice  a  large  difference  in  the  amount  of  IMLEO  for  a 
manned  Mars  mission.    However,  if  we  include  the  IMLEO  for  all  pre-positioned 
elements,  as  in  Figure  69,  once  aerobraking  is  employed,  the  IMLEO  is  virtually  the 
same  for  both  a  short  and  extended  stay  mission.    In  addition,  the  use  of  aerobraking 
and parachutes, followed by a powered touchdown for the Landers, reduces the amount 
of fuel that they must use, and therefore further reduces the initial mass in LEO.

Figure 69: Comparison of Mars trajectories 

 
By  analyzing  the  Mars  trajectories,  we  have  concluded  that  a  Mars  orbit  rendezvous 
(MOR)  with  pre-positioning  is  essential  for  reduced  mass  in  LEO  and  is  thus  the 
baseline  architecture  for  all  other  comparisons.    For  a  short-stay  mission,  a  fly-by  of 
Venus  is  essential  for  a  reasonable  IMLEO  for  a  human  Mars  mission.    Since  this 
maneuver  is  complicated  and  potentially  exposes  the  crew  to  significant  increases  in 
radiation  dosage,  as  well  as  other  complications,  the  human  factors  elements  must  be 
studied  in  greater  depth.    By  examining  the Mars  trajectories  for  an  extended  stay,  the 
increase  in  IMLEO  for  a  fast  transfer  is  abated  by  the  significantly  lower  travel  time,  as 
compared  to  a  conjunction  class  mission.    In  addition,  the  reduced  microgravity  and 
radiation  exposure  makes  this  trajectory  desirable.    Aerobraking  has  been  shown  to 
significantly  reduce  the  initial  mass  in  LEO  for  every  type  of  trajectory  and  is  essential 
for a manned mission  to Mars.   When  the  short-stay and extended-stay  trajectories are 
compared,  including  all  pre-positioned  elements,  we  notice  that  the  initial  masses  in 
LEO are comparable, when aerobraking is employed.  IMLEO is further reduced when a 
parachute and powered touchdown are utilized.

7.  Scenarios 

7.1 Introduction 
Scenario  planning  is  a  method  that  may  be  used  to  determine  the  degree  to  which  a 
given system responds to changes in the environment. By proposing scenarios, many of 
them  examples  of  the  extreme  cases,  and  evaluating  the  ways  in  which  the  system 
would  change  or  would  fail  to  change,  critical  contingencies  may  be  planned  into  the 
final  design.  This  section  outlines  a  set  of  seven  scenarios  and  the  anticipated 
responses to them.  

7.2 Reasons for scenario-based planning 
It  is  important  to  recognize  that  each  design,  including  the  baseline  presented  in  this 
report,  carries  with  it  implicit  assumptions  about  the  state  of  the  present  and  future 
environment.  These  assumptions  about  the  environment  constitute  a  de  facto  scenario 
in  which  the  system  is  designed  to  operate  nominally.  Due  the  high  degree  of 
uncertainty,  and  associated  high  probability  of  change  surrounding  these  assumptions, 
it  is  necessary  that  the  system  designed  be  able  to  adapt  to  changing  environmental 
factors.  Seven  extreme  changes  in  the  system’s  operating  environment  were  selected 
as  scenarios  against  which  the  baseline  system’s  performance  could  be  evaluated. 
Scenario  planning  is  primarily  used  in  this  fashion  to  identify  architectural  options  and 
trades.  In  doing  so,  the  system may  be made  adaptable  or  robust  in  the  face  changing 
environmental  conditions.  In  this  section,  the  baseline  strategy  was  evaluated  using 
each of the following scenarios. Where possible, options were exercised that allowed for 
significant  adaptability  or  robustness  to  the  constraints  imposed  by  the  scenario’s 
parameters.  The  performance  of  the  baseline  strategy  upon  the  use  of  these  options 
serves to demonstrate the degree to which this strategy  is sustainable and extensible  in 
the face of drastic change. 

7.3 Scenarios 

7.3.1 Space Race II 

7.3.1.1 Description 
A  foreign power successfully demonstrates a mission  to  the Moon similar  in style  to  the 
Apollo-11  mission  of  1969.  Upon  successful  completion  of  their  mission,  the  foreign 
power announces its intention to establish a permanent colony on the Moon and to land 
a  human  crew  on  Mars  within  the  decade.  The  United  States  public  perceives  that  its 
leadership  in  space  exploration  is  in  danger.  In  response  to  this  concern,  Congress 
triples  NASA’s  budget  to  approximately  4%  of  the  total  US  budget.  NASA  is  instructed 
to  reach  Mars  and  to  demonstrate  colonization  capabilities  on  the  Moon  before  the 
foreign power as the top priority.

7.3.1.2 Response 
With such a rapid  influx of money with the requirement of exploring Mars and colonizing 
the  Moon  within  a  decade,  NASA’s  best  chance  for  success  would  be  realized  by 
following  the  Apollo  model:  develop  a  simple  mission  statement  and  optimize  a  point 
design.    Technology  development  would  be  kept  to  a  minimum  to  meet  schedule 
constraints.    In  this  case,  the  current  prioritization  of  cost  over  schedule  and 
performance would change: schedule would be  fixed, performance would be optimized, 
and cost would be variable. 
 
The  mission  outline  is  as  follows:  to  meet  schedule  requirements,  a  70-80-ton  launch 
vehicle  will  be  developed  utilizing  components  of  the  STS.    Money  will  be  poured  into 
man-rating  this  new  vehicle,  and  existing  STS  construction  plants  and  launch  facilities 
will  be  utilized.    Funding  for  the  development  and  operation  of  the  International  Space 
Station would also increase to accelerate research into countermeasures to the adverse 
impact of microgravity on human physiology.   Because  the mission  to Mars  is a priority, 
all  hardware  developed  (landers,  crew  transport,  rovers) will  be  optimized  for Mars,  not 
the Moon, and thus will most likely be over-designed for the lunar missions.   
 
To  demonstrate  colonization  capabilities  on  the  Moon,  construction  of  a  lunar  surface 
base would  have  to  commence within  ten  years.   Specifically,  getting  to  the Moon,  and 
demonstrating  technologies  are  a  priority,  but  not  science;  therefore,  the medium-sized 
missions will be sacrificed (see section 4.2.2) in favor of a few short missions and a long 
mission  (lunar  base)  as  soon  as  possible,  establishing  semi-permanent  human 
presence.    In order  to credibly demonstrate a sustained human presence capability,  the 
base  will  support  developing  in-situ  resources  with  the  ultimate  goal  of  becoming  self-
sufficient.  Rather than selecting a fixed construction site before detailed investigation of 
the  lunar surface, one possibility  is  for  the  initial surface bases  to be pressurized  rovers 
on  the  order  of  10,000  kg  with  habitation,  laboratory,  EVA  airlock,  and  re-supply 
elements.    In  this  case,  short-stays  on  the  order  of  two  weeks  enabling  exploration  of 
the  lunar  surface  would  begin  the  colonization  program;  with  infrastructure  build-up 
occurring once a site has been selected  for a permanent base.   Fuel cells would power 
the initial pressurized rovers; a nuclear reactor would be the primary source of power for 
a  permanent,  fixed  base.    Science  operations  not  in  support  of  in-situ  resource 
utilization  and  other  colonization  technologies  will  be  kept  to  a  minimum,  as  these  are 
not imperative demonstrations for a semi-permanent Moon base or for a Mars mission. 
 
For  landing  humans  on  Mars  and  bringing  them  safely  back  to  Earth,  a  short  stay 
mission  minimizing  duration  and  consisting  of  600  days  of  transit  time  and  60  days  of 
surface  operations  via  an  opposition  class  free-return  trajectory  with  a  Venus  fly-by 
would  serve  as  a  baseline  goal  (see  section  4.2.4).    To meet  schedule  requirements  of 
successful  completion  within  a  decade,  the  short  stay  Mars  mission  would  have  to  be 
launched  within  eight  years.    Given  this  short  time  window,  all  chemical  propellant  will 
be used for propulsion, and no pre-positioning will be used.

Although  the  schedule  is  accelerated  rapidly  in  this  scenario  to  accomplish  two  specific 
objectives  within  a  decade,  it  is  important  to  note  that  our  overall  exploration 
architecture  remains  unchanged:  a  sustainable  human  presence  in  outer  space.   
Missions in this scenario flow from existing Moon and Mars baselines with  infrastructure 
increasing capabilities over time. 

7.3.1.3 Associated Trades and Options 
This scenario  illustrates a choice  that must be made with  regards  to how extensible  the 
final  system  should  be.  A  typical  engineering  situation  will  require  a  trade-off  between 
extensibility  and  optimality.  In  the  case  of  a  drastic  shift  in  U.S.  policy,  it  may  be 
required  to  sacrifice  some  of  the  options  that  gear  the  baseline  strategy  towards 
extensibility  so  that  one  particular  goal  can  be met  as  soon  as  possible.  In  this  case,  a 
point-design  would  be  ideal,  and  all  of  the  features  geared  towards  creating  a  space 
exploration  system  that  can  adapt  through  time would  simply  be  a  hindrance  on  overall 
system performance. On  the other hand,  if no such policy goal  is set, and sustainability 
remains  the  direction  of  choice,  extensibility  will  dominate  over  optimality  in  many 
situations.  An  example  of  this  trade-off  is  the  degree  to  which  time  should  be  spent  on 
the Moon in training for Martian missions. A maximally extensible mission might perform 
a  large  number  of  lunar  tests  before  finally  deciding  to  send  humans  to  the  Martian 
environment,  where  rescue  will  be  significantly  more  difficult.  On  the  other  hand,  a 
mission  that  is  optimized  for  a  quick  Martian  landing  will  spend  less  time  training 
technologies  which  are  unnecessary  to  the  primary  goal  of  landing  a  human  on  Mars, 
such as rover transportation and lunar ISPP. 

7.3.2 Launch System Failure 

7.3.2.1 Description 
NASA’s  primary  launch  vehicle  is  destroyed  during  operation  due  to  a  technical  failure, 
killing  the  entire  crew  compliment.  All  usage  of  that  particular  vehicle  ceases  until  the 
problem  can  be  isolated  and  fixed,  a  process  that  may  take  as  long  as  five  years. 
American astronauts are  involved  in space exploration activities during  the catastrophe, 
thus  requiring  that  they  find  another  method  to  leave  and  return  to  Earth  as  soon  as 
possible.  

7.3.2.2 Response 
A  launch  system  failure  is  a  terrible  situation.  Due  to  the  danger  inherent  in  launch 
activities, the risk of something like this happening is always present. Much can be done 
in  advance  to  reduce  the  impact  that  such  an  accident  would  have  on  the  overall 
exploration mission, for example, launch the crew and cargo separately. Design of lunar 
transfer and Martian  transfer vehicles  to employ a docking mechanism and an orbit  that 
allows  for  foreign  vehicles  to  dock  on  it will  ensure  that  in  the  case  of  a  launch  system 
failure,  NASA  has  the  option  of  turning  to  international  partners  for  support.  If  these 
cautious measures  are  taken  in  advance,  the  impact  on  the  exploration  agenda  can  be 
minimized.

      169              

 

If  the  launch  failure  involves only  the heavy cargo vehicle  it will be a setback, but only a 
minor  one.  In  this  case  the  vehicle  is  unlikely  to  be  grounded  for  more  than  a  year. 
However,  if  the  decision  where  made  to  use  the  same  vehicle  for  humans  and  heavy 
cargo  and  that  vehicle  failed  catastrophically,  then  the  consequences  would  be  very 
serious and  the  leadership of  the United States of America  in human space  flight would 
be very vulnerable. 

7.3.2.3 Associated Trades and Options 
One way to incorporate robustness against this scenario would be to create a redundant 
second launch vehicle design. There are two ways that this could be done: 
 
The  first  way  involves  heavy  cooperation  with  international  partners  who  already  have 
human  launch  capability.  Essentially,  the  United  States  government  would  encourage 
countries  to  create  a  second  human-rated  heavy-lift  launch  vehicle,  which  could  be 
capable of replacing  the American vehicle  in case of a disaster. As a  foreign policy  tool, 
this approach would  internationalize  the space exploration program and would allow  for 
another  country  to  share  in  the  financial  burdens.  This  has  benefits  in  that  it may  save 
long-term  costs  and  in  that  it  could  potentially  improving  foreign  relations.  Furthermore, 
America  would  be  less  likely  to  pull  out  of  the  space  exploration  theater  if  another 
country were  actively  participating.  This  eventuality  is  highly  unlikely  however,  since,  in 
the  event  of  a  major  American  launch  system  failure,  the  other  power  would  retain  de 
facto  leadership  in  the space exploration  theater. Furthermore,  the U.S. would probably 
have  to  supply  some  initial  monetary  investment  in  the  foreign  space  vehicle  and/or 
some  initial  economic  incentive  to  the  country  that  would  be  providing  that  vehicle. 
Finally,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  a  foreign  country  would  follow  through  with  their 
promise  to  create  a  launch  vehicle,  and  no  way  to  enforce  that  they  do  follow  through. 
These considerations make this option a high-risk and high-initial-cost investment. 
 
The  second way  involves  creating  a  competitive  structure within  American  business.  In 
this  situation,  the U.S. would  contract  the  creation  of  two  separate  and  different  launch 
vehicles, each  from a different company. Each of  these  launch vehicles would compete 
for a use, on a per-mission or a per-program basis. Although the initial investment in this 
option  is  very  high  as well,  there  are  significant  benefits  to  be  realized. Primarily,  in  the 
event  of  a  launch  vehicle  disaster,  a  second  launch  vehicle  would  be  available  to 
continue  the  program.  Furthermore,  the  competitive  structure  of  this  system  would 
encourage  each  of  the  two  companies  to  provide  their  top  assurances  that  their  own 
vehicle  out-performs  its  competitor(s)  in  every  respect  (safety,  reliability,  mass,  etc.). 
This  would  contribute  greatly  to  overall  sustainability,  and  would  overcome  the 
limitations  imposed by this scenario. Furthermore, this approach has added extensibility 
benefits, since each  launch vehicle provider would be competing  for  the next mission or 
the  next  program.  This  would  encourage  launch  vehicle  providers  to  design  their 
vehicles  in  an  extensible  fashion  such  that,  following  the  completion  of  one  mission, 
their  product  would  require  minimal  redesign  before  the  next  mission.  There  are, 
however, major cost-related drawbacks to this option. NASA’s budget is limited, and the 
initial  cost  for  this  type  of  venture may  be  expected  to  be  at  least  twice  as  high  as  the 
initial  cost  of  designing  just  one  launch  vehicle.  Since  the  market  is  limited  to  just  one

      170              

 

buyer,  namely  NASA,  companies  would  not  be  as  likely  to  commit  to  this  proposition 
since  it would,  for  them, represent a very high  investment with a high-risk of small or no 
payoff.  This  structure  could  only  be  maintained  through  one  of  two  methods,  namely 
continual  subsidies,  which  would  put  unparalleled  strain  on  NASA’s  budget,  or  the 
opening  of  the  market  to  other  buyers  (e.g.  other  countries  and  private  individuals), 
which  has  strong  policy  implications  (e.g.,  technology  transfer,  maintenance  of  space 
leadership, etc.) that would have first have to be addressed. 

7.3.3 Dawn of the Nuclear Propulsion Age 

7.3.3.1 Description 
Nuclear propulsion technology emerges as a viable replacement to chemical propulsion. 
The  technology  is  more  efficient,  can  generate  a  higher-specific  impulse,  and  has  a 
higher amount of  total  thrust at  liftoff. While  it  is  initially  very  expensive  and  has  not  yet 
been  flight-tested,  it  is  expected  to  be  approved  for  flight within  2  years.  The  sensitivity 
of  nuclear  technology  prevents  its  development  in  cooperation with  foreign  nations  and 
its  use  on  foreign  launch  vehicles.  If  mishandles  it  may  cause  catastrophic  failure. 
Although  extensive  testing  suggests  that  the  technology  is  highly  reliable,  the  public  is 
wary given that significant damage may result if it is misused. 

7.3.3.2 Response 
The  use  of  nuclear  propulsion  would  benefit  a  space  exploration  system  program  in 
several  ways.    First,  since  nuclear  propulsion  has  a  higher  specific  impulse  than 
conventional chemical propulsion systems,  initial mass required  in  low Earth orbit would 
be  reduced  for each mission using nuclear propulsion.   This benefit would have a  large 
impact  on  the  mission  design.    One  benefit  would  be  an  increase  the  amount  of  non-
propulsion system mass  in  the  launch vehicle.   This  increased payload efficiency would 
allow for potentially more redundancy or scientific hardware to be launched for the same 
launch cost.  On the other hand, this reduction in propulsion system mass could also be 
a  cost  savings measure  since  it  could  reduce  overall  payload mass  and  in-turn  reduce 
launch costs. 
 
In  addition,  if  high-thrust  nuclear  propulsion  systems  become  available,  a  significant 
reduction  in  time of  flight  from Earth  to  the desired destination would occur.   This would 
provide  several  benefits.    First,  it  would  minimize  the  exposure  of  the  crew  to 
microgravity  by  reducing  their  transit  time.   Second,  this would  allow  the  crew  to  spend 
more  time at  the destination  than  they would  if  they used a chemical propulsion system 
to transfer to the destination. 
 
If  the  use  of  nuclear  propulsion  is  realized  and  these  cost  reduction  and  human  factors 
benefits become clear, nuclear propulsion  technology will  likely be  incorporated  into  the 
space exploration system architecture.  The incorporation of this technology depends on 
what  stage  the  space  exploration  program  is  at  when  nuclear  propulsion  technology 
becomes  viable.    If  nuclear  propulsion  becomes  viable  during  the  design  phase  of  the 
program,  it  is  likely  that  the  initial,  short  missions  to  the  Moon  will  still  use  chemical

      171              

 

propulsion  but  the  larger-scale  missions  to  the  Moon  would  test  nuclear  propulsion 
technology in preparation for its use on missions to Mars. 
 
If  nuclear  propulsion  technology  becomes  viable  when  the  first  manned  missions  to 
Mars  are  being  launched,  it  is  likely  the  technology will  not  be  used  for  the  first Martian 
mission.    However,  nuclear  propulsion  technology  may  still  be  incorporated  into  the 
space exploration architecture.   For example, a precursor mission  to  the Moon could be 
used  to  test  the  propulsion  technology.    This  would  once  again  utilize  the  Moon  as  a 
“test bed”  for missions  to Mars.   Once  the  technology has been successfully  tested,  the 
“Extended  Stay”  or  “Extended  Stay  +  Infrastructure”  Mars  missions  could  be  launched 
using nuclear propulsion. 
 
In  conclusion,  if  the  potential  cost  savings  from  incorporating  advanced  nuclear 
propulsion  technology  can  be  realized,  the  space  exploration  program  may  be  able  to 
increase  mission  frequency  or  enhance  program  sustainability.    The  reduction  in  the 
cost  of  launching  each  mission  may  allow  for  more  missions  to  be  flown  for  the  same 
cost.    Alternatively,  a  reduction  in  program  costs  would  make  the  program  more 
sustainable  by  reducing  the  portion  of  the  total  NASA  budget  consumed  by  the  space 
exploration  program.    Politicians  may  be  more  willing  to  fund  the  program  if  they  see 
more value for reduced costs. 

7.3.3.3 Associated Trades and Options 
Although  the  initial  cost  of  designing  nuclear  propulsion  modules  for  use  in  a  space 
exploration  program  may  be  high,  the  cost  of  incorporating  the  new  propulsion 
technology  into  the  exploration  program  should  not  be  large  if  the  propulsion 
architecture  is modular.   This will allow propulsion modules  to be exchanged as  long as 
common  interfaces  are  used.    This  is  another  exploitation  of  the  advantages  of 
designing  an  extensible  space  exploration  system  by  using  modular  components. 
Generally, modularity is more difficult and more expensive to design into a system. If, on 
the  other  hand,  the  propulsion  systems  are  designed  such  that  they  are  “built-in”, 
incorporation of the benefits of this new technology may be even more expensive.  

7.3.4 Asteroid Strike 

7.3.4.1 Description 
A  Near  Earth  Asteroid  impacts  the  Earth’s  atmosphere,  exploding  harmlessly  over  the 
ocean,  causing  noticeable  changes  in  weather  patterns  (e.g.,  tsunamis,  storms,  etc.). 
Scientists  unanimously  agree  that  if  the  asteroid  had  exploded  over  a  populated  area, 
significant  death would  have  resulted.  The US  government  allocates  approximately  4% 
of  the  total  yearly  US  budget  between  NASA  and  the  DoD  for  the  development  of  an 
early warning system, and to explore the possibilities of destroying or diverting asteroids 
on Earth impact trajectories.

7.3.4.2.1 Background on Asteroids 
It  is  estimated  that  asteroid  impacts  occur  approximately  once  every  century,  with  the 
most  recent  such  event  taking  place  in  Tunguska  forest,  Siberia  in  1908.    Small 
asteroids  on  the  order  of  one meter  in  diameter  burn  up  in  the  atmosphere with  impact 
energy equivalent  to  tens of kilotons of TNT  (Rabinowitz, 1998).   The  threshold size  for 
asteroids  capable  of  global  disaster  is  believed  to  be  ½  to  1  km,  and  the  impact 
frequency  for  these  asteroids  are  once  every  1000  centuries  on  average  (Rabinowitz, 
1998).    It  is  hypothesized  that  there  are  between  1000  and  2000  Earth-approaching 
asteroids  larger  than  1  km,  however  only  approximately  100  have  been  discovered  so 
far (Rabinowitz, 1998). 

7.3.4.2.2 State of the art 
Current  programs  for  asteroid  (also  called  Near  Earth  Objects,  NEOs)  detection  and 
cataloging  involve  observations  at  optical  telescopes  worldwide  including  efforts  by 
MIT’s  Lincoln  Near  Earth  Asteroid  Research 
(LINEAR)  Project,  JPL,  and 
SPACEWATCH at  the University of Arizona.   Large  telescopes and  time exposures are 
usually  required  in  the  search  for  asteroids  since  they  have  absolute  magnitudes 
ranging  from  approximately  17  to  less  than  24  (Smith,  2001).    Significant  progress  has 
been made  in detection, and  in  the year 2000,  the rate of Near Earth asteroid discovery 
reached  almost  one  per  day  from  about  one  per  month  in  1990  (Smith,  2001).    In 
addition, NASA has designed and carried out a successful asteroid rendezvous mission, 
the  NEAR  Shoemaker,  which  was  launched  on  Feb.  17,  1996  and  became  the  first 
spacecraft  to orbit an asteroid on Feb. 14, 2000 (Brand, 2001).   Almost a year  later,  the 
spacecraft  executed  a  controlled  landing  on  the  surface  of  Eros.    This  mission  has 
provided  many  images  of  the  target  asteroid  as  well  as  operational  experience  with 
asteroid interception. 
 

7.3.4.2.3 Plan of Action and its Effect on the Exploration Initiative 
In  the  case  that  NASA  were  charged  with  developing  an  asteroid  detection  and 
deflection  system, 
three  concerns  would  be  of  primary 
importance,  namely: 
characterization of asteroids, development of early warning capabilities, and procedures 
for interception and deflection 
 
It  is  likely  that  a  good  part  of NASA’s  budget  increase would  be  used  to  fund  programs 
such as MIT’s LINEAR project and the requisite telescopes for detection and cataloging. 
This  would  aid  in  asteroid  characterization,  as  well  as  a  reduction  in  uncertainty  of 
ephemeris data that would assist in the development of an early warning program. 
 
Furthermore,  a  series  of  small  missions  akin  to  the  NEAR  project  to  orbit  and 
rendezvous  with  asteroids  could  be  initiated.    It  is  very  unlikely  that  these  missions 
would  be  manned  since  the  time  scale  would  be  too  short  to  develop  the  redundancy 
and  safety  assurances  necessary.    Also,  it  would  be  much  easier  to  launch  these 
missions  if  the mass  could  be  kept  relatively  low  –  not  having  a  crew  would mean  that 
life  support  systems  and  a  return  to  Earth  (and  the  required  propellant)  would  be

      173              

 

unnecessary.    This  way,  the  mass  could  be  kept  to  a  level  were  the  probe  could  be 
launched  on  a  common  launch  vehicle  such  as  a  Delta  IV  (Smith,  2001).    These 
missions  would  aid  in  the  characterization  of  asteroids  as  well  as  the  development  of 
operational  knowledge  required  for  interception  and  deflection.    Deflection  schemes 
could also be tested on such missions. 
 
The  increase  in  NASA’s  budget  would  have  a  beneficial  effect  on  the  exploration 
initiative  as  well  as  the  asteroid  protection  scheme.    Budgets  for  certain  enabling 
technologies such as nuclear propulsion would be  likely  to  increase since  in  the case of 
a  short warning  time,  it would  be  necessary  to  reach  the dangerous asteroid as  quickly 
as  possible.    Nuclear  propulsion  would  facilitate  a  mission  to  Mars  or  the  Moon  by 
significantly  reducing  IMLEO.    The  exploration  program may  also  be  affected  in  that  its 
principal  destinations  would  be  modified.    Along  with  the  series  of  unmanned missions 
to  NEOs,  a  manned  mission  to  Phobos  would  be  a  practical  alternative:  both  as  a 
precursor  Mars  mission,  and  as  a  possible  asteroid  characterization  mission  (since 
Phobos  is  thought  to  be  a  captured  asteroid).    This  would  be  possible  since  the 
ephemeris data  for Phobos  is much more certain  than  that of most NEOs and  therefore 
sending humans to Phobos would be less risky than a similar asteroid mission.   
 
The  shift  of  focus  towards  asteroids  and  away  from  exploration  for  its  own  sake  would 
have a significant effect on  the exploration program.    It  is possible  that planned  lunar or 
Mars  missions  would  be  postponed  while  effort  is  diverted  into  smaller  asteroid 
rendezvous missions.   On  the other hand, given  the  increased  total budget, NASA may 
be  able  to  expand  its  workforce  and  maintain  the  exploration  program  at  full  strength 
with  minor  changes  such  as  emphasis  on  particular  enabling  technologies  or 
destinations. 

7.3.4.3 Associated Trades and Options 
A  decision  on  whether  or  not  to  land  on  Phobos,  and  thus  develop  knowledge  and 
technology  that may be applied  toward  future asteroid operations, represents  the option 
for  this  scenario.  On  the  one  hand,  Phobos  may  not  be  compelling  to  the  public 
compared to the allure of Mars. Landing on Phobos may be viewed by many as a waste 
of  resources  that  could  otherwise  be  diverted  to  a  Mars  exploration  program.  On  the 
other  hand,  if  asteroid  missions  become  a  priority,  Phobos  would  provide  a  testing 
ground for these operations. 

7.3.5 Lunar Water World 

7.3.5.1 Description 
An American expedition to the Moon discovers reserves of resources at the Lunar Poles, 
allowing  for  the  large-scale  extraction  of  hydrogen,  oxygen,  and  water  ice.  Potential 
rates of extraction and production could sustain a  lunar colony of 30 people  indefinitely. 
International  interest  rises,  and  coalition  of  developing  and  space-faring  nations 
proposes the development of a permanently manned international lunar base.

7.3.5.2 Response 
 
The American Expedition discovers the water resources in year 2010. This event results 
in an  increased  interest  in  the Moon, and  the modification of previous plans,  installing a 
permanent  base  by  year  2016.  International  partners  participate  in  this  effort,  and  the 
base is used largely for science and a deeper exploration of the lunar satellite. 
 
This  deeper  exploration  leads  to  the  discovery  and  valuation  of  additional  resources, 
which  would  include  additional  underground  water  resources,  He3  repositories  and 
Rare  Earth  mining.  The  fact  that  water  can  be  cheaply  dissociated  using  solar  energy 
brings an important economic value to this discovery. 
 
The  fact  that some of  the cargo  for  the Mars and beyond missions will be shipped  from 
the  Earth  and  some  of  it  will  be  shipped  from  the  Moon  under  this  scenario  increases 
the  importance  of  an  EM-L1  node  in  Space  Exploration  beyond  the  EM  neighborhood, 
and propitiates a case for a Space Station parked at this point (Kent, 2001).  
 
Using  present  day  technologies,  the  following  table  shows  the  advantage  gained  in 
sending one kilogram of propellant to the L1 point, which is the most likely storage point 
for propellant to be sent out of the Earth Moon Neighborhood.

This advantage allows increasing travels outside of the Earth neighborhood to be easier 
to  afford,  and  at  the  same  time  gives  the  Moon  station  a  revenue  case  that  helps  to 
sustain the costs of the scientific base. 
 
Additional  water  resources  and  increased Moon  travel  frequency  prompt market  forces 
to  intervene,  and make  feasible  the  establishment  of  a  tourist’s  hotel  on  the Moon,  and 
eventually a stable civil population. 
 
By  year  2022,  freight  to  the  Moon  is  handled  by  private  corporations,  while  NASA  only 
operates  the  Moon  scientific  base,  and  focuses  its  exploration  efforts  on  Mars  and 
beyond.  Fuel  production  also  is  handled  by  private  corporations,  which  have  already 
invested heavily in the Hydrogen Industry on Earth.  
 
There  is  therefore  an  increased  interest  on  the Moon  that  leads,  to  some  degree,  to  its 
trivialization.  The  exploration  quest  continues,  but  beyond  the  Earth  neighborhood, 
helped by the fact that fuel is easier and less costly to obtain, and that two lower escape

velocity nodes are present on  the system:  the Moon  itself, with a stable population, and 
the L1 point as a supply node that holds deposits of fuel and supplies. 
 
It  is arguable  that  the additional  interest, and  resources  that  the Moon base will  require, 
could  reduce  the  investment  rate  for  the  Mars  exploration  on  the  short  term.  On  the 
other  hand,  the  trivialization  of  space  travels  that  this  scenario  could  imply  will  allow  a 
cheaper and faster exploration of the remaining solar system assets on the longer term. 
 

7.3.5.3 Associated Trades and Options 
The  primary  option  associated  with  this  scenario  is  the  use  of  the  EM-L1  point.  If  the 
ability  to  transit  through  this point  is originally  included  in  the  lunar  transit architecture  it 
may be easier  to  reach  the  lunar poles without having  to do an energy-expensive plane 
change  in  lunar orbit.  If, on  the other hand, a decision  is made not  to  transit  to  the  lunar 
poles,  this  extra  option  is  not  utilized,  and  constitutes  a  deviation  from  an  efficient 
design.  A  similar  option  to  be  considered  is  the  value  of  creating  a  space  station  of 
some  sort  at  the  L1  point.  Doing  so may  allow  for  refueling  to  occur  on  the  way  to  the 
Moon, Mars and other celestial bodies. On the other hand, stations require maintenance. 
One  possible  way  to  get  around  this  constraint  would  be  to  create  a  station  that  is 
somewhat autonomous. In this situation, the station would not require a constant human 
presence,  although  such  a  temporary  presence  may  be  desirable  for  other  reasons, 
such as regular routine maintenance and microgravity-related research. 
 

7.3.6 Little Green Martian Cells 

7.3.6.1 Description 
Following  discoveries  of  microbial  fossils  on  Mars,  unmanned  probes  find  strong 
evidence of one-celled  life currently existing  in  the Martian subsurface soil. The Public’s 
interest  is piqued and NASA  receives a 5% budget  increase  to hasten Mars exploration 
efforts.  Some  groups  on  Earth  protest  the  government’s  decision,  stating  that  the 
Martian biosphere should not be contaminated by human presence. 

7.3.6.2 Response 
With the discovery of possible life, the Moon missions would be de-emphasized, and the 
timelines  for  Mars  would  be  moved  up.  It  is  likely  that  more  precursor-manned  and 
unmanned  mission  would  be  sent  to  Mars  to  further  investigate  the  life  phenomenon.  
The budget increase would be used to fund these efforts. 
 
There are currently a significant number of missions geared  towards  investigating  lunar 
resources  and  towards  building  up  a  lunar  infrastructure/habitation  knowledge  base.  
Since  one  of  the  purposes  of  the  lunar missions  is  to  serve  as  technology  test  beds  for 
subsequent  missions  to  Mars,  lunar  missions  may  be  cut  down  in  size,  with  emphasis 
placed  on  those  missions  and  technology  demonstrations  that  are  deemed  critical  for 
enabling human  life on Mars.   Since  the Lunar missions are  to  serve as  testbeds many

      176              

 

of  the systems used  for Martian explorations,  the exploration system  is highly  flexible  to 
this change. 
 
Since  most  of  the  lunar  missions  and  tests  are  scheduled  to  occur  in  the  timeframe  of 
the  next  20  years,  the  introduction  of  this  scenario  would  significantly  reduce  this 
schedule.  This  development  would  have  the  effect  of  shifting  timelines  for  Mars 
missions almost 20 years ahead.  This would have the effect of making the projection of 
a Mars short-stay mission more feasible since it relies heavily on current technology and 
requires relatively little technology testing.  
 
To  placate  concerns  on  Earth  about  contaminating  the  Martian  biosphere  as  well  as 
protecting any human crew from contamination, precursor missions such as the Phobos 
and Deimos missions  and more  robotic missions  could  increase  in  value.    Landing  site 
certification  would  become  paramount,  so  as  to  ensure  that  the  environment  is  not 
destroyed  by  astronaut  landing  activities.    An  ideal  landing  site  would  be  close  to  the 
signs  of  life,  but  the  landing  site  itself  should  be  chosen  so  as  to  will  not  irreversibly 
disturb  the  local  organisms.    Further  unmanned  investigation  would  give  mission 
planners a better idea of any contamination risk. 

7.3.6.3 Associated Trades and Options 
One  trade  that  may  be  drawn  from  this  scenario  is  a  decision  on  the  degree  to  which 
lunar  missions  will  focus  on  activities  that  are  not  Mars-related,  such  as  exploration  of 
the  lunar  poles  and  of  other  sites  of  scientific  interest.  The  fundamental  decision  that 
must  be  made  is  one  of  the  science  agenda  versus  the  exploration  agenda.  On  one 
extreme,  every  square meter  of  the Moon  could  be mapped  and  cataloged  in  a  search 
for  scientifically  interesting  phenomena  that  are  associated  with  the  lunar  surface.  On 
the  other  extreme  is  a  situation  in  which  NASA  simply  lands  on  the  Moon  as  a 
technology  demonstration  before  going  directly  to  Mars  in  the  name  of  exploration.  A 
similar  question  may  be  asked  of  the  degree  to  which  life  on  Mars  is  studied.  On  the 
one  extreme,  it  may  warrant  such  in-depth  analysis  that  humanity  does  not  go  beyond 
Mars  for  decades. On  the  other  extreme,  the  presence  of  life may  simply  be  confirmed 
for  its  news  value  before  NASA  proceeds  to  other  locales.  This  scenario  highlights  a 
situation  in  which  an  option  to  explore  the Moon  was  sidelined  in  favor  of  the  option  to 
explore the possibility of Martian life. In evaluating this choice, a decision must be made 
so  as  to  ensure  that  the  knowledge, which  is most  important  to  the  key  stakeholders  is 
delivered. 

7.3.7 Budget Catastrophe 

7.3.7.1 Description 
Motivated  by  election-year  debates,  a  nationwide  referendum  reveals  that  the  60%  of 
the  population  of  the  United  States  prefers  to  divert  their  tax  dollars  away  from  NASA 
towards  programs  such  as  inner-city  development  and  veterans’  hospitals.  Congress 
cuts  NASA’s  by  25%  and  restricts  NASA’s  activity  to  education,  remote  sensing  and 
Earth observation. 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      177              

 

7.3.7.2 Response 
A  situation  of  this  magnitude  essentially  puts  a  moratorium  on  all  space  exploration 
activities.  If  such an eventuality were  to occur,  the only way exploration activities would 
be reinstated requires direct intervention of the President or of Congress. In either case, 
this  would  probably  have  to  be  motivated  by  public  demand  or  by  outside  political 
pressure  (e.g.,  for  foreign  policy  reasons).  Although  outside  political  concerns  are 
beyond  the  control  of NASA  in  any  situation,  the  degree  to which NASA  could  rekindle 
the  public’s  interest  in  exploration  is  directly  related  to  the  knowledge  that  has  already 
been  gained.  If  there were  significant  knowledge  available, NASA, which  is  responsible 
for educating  the public on  its space exploration activities, would be able  to present  this 
body  of  knowledge.  Like most  learning,  this  education  would  probably  raise  at  least  as 
many  questions  as  it  does  answer.  Thus,  the  natural  curiosity  and  inquisitiveness  of 
many  people  would  contribute  to  public  support  for  re-instatement  of  the  space 
exploration  initiative.  Therefore,  the  worst-case  scenario  would  involve  this  situation 
occurring  immediately,  before  any  new  knowledge  has  been  gained.  In  this  situation, 
very little could be done by NASA to overcome the public’s disinterest, particularly since 
NASA,  like  any  other  government  agency,  does  not  advertise.  As  NASA  begins  to 
collect  more  knowledge  and  to  return  more  results  and  information  to  the  public,  it 
becomes  less  likely  that  the  exploration  initiative  will  be  cut  by  public  demand.  In  any 
case,  NASA,  as  a  government  agency,  does  not  advertise  or  push  a  specific  political 
agenda.  Thus  any  movement  for  space  exploration  would  have  to  be  independently 
initiated.  Therefore,  even  in  the  very  unlikely  event  that  public  support  were  to  drop 
dramatically  after  a  momentous  act  (such  as  the  first  human  landing  on  Mars),  there 
would  be  little NASA  could  do  about  it  directly.  It  is  therefore  incumbent  upon NASA  to 
design  a  knowledge  delivery  system  in  such  a  way  that  it  would  prevent  this  scenario 
from  occurring.  One  sure-fire  way  to  do  this  is  to  keep  the  public’s  interest  high.  This 
could  be  accomplished  through  a  regular  series  of  reports  and  outreach  activities  in 
which  NASA  discusses  its  most  recent  accomplishments.  The  four  year  long  election 
cycle  provides  an  ideal  length  of  time  during  which  NASA  may  set  a  series  of  major 
milestones,  which  would  be  designed  to  engage  the  public  and  to  maintain  interest  in 
space  exploration.  For  example,  at  the  end  of  one  four-year  cycle,  a  CEV  prototype 
could be  flown and docked with  the  ISS. Four years  later,  the  first  lunar CEV could  land 
on  the  Moon.  Each  of  these  major  milestones  could  be  punctuated  with  a  series  of 
smaller  yearly  milestones.  At  the  end  of  the  fist  year,  for  example,  the  CEV  concept 
would  be  revealed  to  the  public. The  year  after,  an  unmanned mockup would  be  flown. 
The year after that, test flights would occur, culminating  in the ISS docking at the end of 
the  fourth  year.  Not  only  would  this  approach  constantly  engage  the  public,  thereby 
promoting  sustainability,  but  also  it  would  foster  regular  technical  progress  as  NASA 
proceeded  with  the  exploration  agenda  milestone  by  milestone,  thus  also  promoting 
extensibility. 

7.3.7.3 Associated Trades and Options 
The primary  trade  that must be analyzed  for  this scenario  is  the degree  to which NASA 
should concentrate on public education, inspiration and awareness campaigns. Keeping 
the public constantly  informed  is a difficult and  time-consuming process. Furthermore,  it

opens  the doors  for  criticism  from  the public.   On  the other hand,  it may be argued  that 
public criticism would improve NASA’s operations in the long run, if taken constructively. 
Furthermore, NASA  is  ultimately  supported  by  the  direction  of  the  President,  who  is,  in 
turn,  supported  by  a mandate  from  the  public.  If  the  public  is  allowed  to  lose  interest  in 
NASA,  it  is  likely  that  funding will be cut, as  the public’s priorities shift away  from space 
exploration  and  towards  other,  more  immediate  concerns.  Ultimately,  the  American 
people are  the primary beneficiaries of NASA’s efforts and some of  the prime  recipients 
of  the  knowledge  gained  through  exploration  programs.  If  the  public  decides  that 
exploration is not worth the associated cost in tax dollars, the program will be cut.

8.  Conclusions 

In conclusion, the following two recommendations are made to NASA:  
 

•  NASA  needs  to  develop  its  own  rigorous  design  methodology  to  incorporate 
sustainability into all levels of the space exploration architecture. 
•  NASA  needs  to  view  knowledge  as  the  product  of  its  exploration  system  and  to 
ensure  that  the  design  and  operation  of  this  system  is  guided  by  the  need  to 
acquire, transfer, and process knowledge. 

 
 
Future  systems  must  be  designed  with  sustainability  in  mind,  ensuring  maximal  life 
cycle  value  (benefit  at  cost),  as  opposed  to  the  traditional  point  design  approach  that 
optimizes  missions  based  on  a  fixed  set  of  requirements.    An  initial  design  framework 
has  been  presented  as  an  example  of  proactively  designing  sustainable  attributes  into 
the  exploration  system.    While  NASA  can  certainly  improve  the  process,  the  key 
message  is  that  sustainability  is  not  accidental;  it  must  be  actively  pursued,  and  the 
short-term  costs  associated  with  designing  for  sustainability must  be  accepted  in  order 
to reap the long-term benefits.   
 
This  paper  lays  the  foundation  of  a methodology  for  designing  sustainability  into  space 
systems.  It  must  also  be  stressed  that  a  system  must  be  sustainable  throughout  time. 
This  requires  that  any  potential  design  method  must  have  the  ability  to  be  reevaluated 
throughout time, so that the design has the ability to react to uncertainties in the future.  
 
Tools  such  as  form/function  mapping,  commonality  mapping,  scenario  planning  along 
with  formalized  decision  analysis,  such  as  utility  analysis  and  real  options,  were 
described  and  demonstrated  in  the  proposed  design  process.    These  tools  are  only 
provided  as  examples  of  structured  methods  for  complex  system  design,  offering  the 
potential for proper valuation of nontraditional system attributes such as sustainability. 
 
The  methodology  and  tools  described  in  this  paper  support  the  design  of  NASA’s  new 
exploration  system.    As  has  been  mentioned  previously,  the  goal  of  this  system  is  to 
deliver  knowledge  to  all  stakeholders.   This goal must be  kept  continually  in mind  if  the 
space exploration program is to be successful and therefore, sustainable.   
 
It  is  the  authors’  hope  that  the  readers  take  away  a  vision  that  current  design methods 
are  not  sufficient  to  meet  the  goals  of  the  new  space  exploration  initiative  and  that  a 
new  design  methodology  must  be  developed.    The  new  methodology  accounts  for 
sustainability  and  evaluates  designs  based  on  knowledge.   While  the  proposed  design 
method  is  certainly  not  the  only  solution,  it  is  intended  to  be  a  starting  point  for  further 
improvement, and ultimately, a  catalyst  that enables NASA and  the nation  to move  into 
the next era of space exploration in a sustained and consistent fashion.

9.1.1.1 Mass Calculation 
For  the service module, mass numbers were  found  from studies or real systems. These 
dry masses were not scaled depending on the number of crew and days of the mission. 
 
For  the  habitable  module,  the  Combined-Reusable-Shuttle,  the  Separate-Expandable-
Soyuz  and  Separate-Reusable-Kliper  configurations,  were  linearly  scaled  given  a 
number of crewmembers. The duration of the mission was not included in the scaling.  
 
For  the  Combined-Expandable-Apollo  and  the  Flexible-OSP/XTV  configurations,  a 
detailed  scaling  was  performed,  including  the  number  of  crew  and  duration  of  the 
mission.  
 
The  reason  for  not  scaling  all  the  habitable  modules  configurations  is  that  we  lacked 
detailed mass breakdown for them. 
 
All  the  existing  spacecraft  masses  (and  the  breakdown  and  other  spacecraft 
information) were  found  in one of  the  following references: (Wade, 2004) or (Zak, 2004) 
or (Braeunig, 2001). 
 

For each system, a rank was determined according to the technique described in Section 6.4.2.4. 
It was a way to try to evaluate systems with the few available data while being as objective as we 
could. The criteria for evaluating each system (and their corresponding weights) are described on 
the left of  
Figure 71. 

 
 

9.1.2. Crew Module Scaling 
A  Report  was  written  by  the  Orbital  Aggregation  &  Space  Infrastructure  Systems 
(OASIS) 
titled,  The  Revolutionary  Aerospace  Systems  Concepts  Preliminary 
Architecture  and  Operations  Analysis  Report  (2002).    This  Report  aimed  to  “identify 
synergistic  opportunities  and  concepts  among  human  exploration  initiatives  and  space 
commercialization  activities  while  taking  into  account  technology  assumptions  and 
mission  viability  in  an  Orbital  Aggregation  &  Space  Infrastructure  Systems  (OASIS) 
framework.”    This  Report  provided  detailed  information  about  a  proposed  crew 
exploration  vehicle  and  the  component  mass  breakdown.    The  methods  of  analysis 
were  explained  as  well  as  engineering  design  details  of  the  structural  components  and 
hardware.   Additional  resources were used  to augment  the scaling analysis,  including a 
NASA Report  titled,  “JSC  Lunar  Transfer  Vehicle  (LTV)  design  concept, Crew  Transfer 
Vehicle Element Conceptual Design Report, EX15-01-094.”

9.1.2.1. OASIS Crew Transfer Vehicle 
For  LEO  crew  transfer,  the  Crew  Transfer  Vehicle  (CTV)  was  described  by  OASIS 
(2002)  and  summarized  below.    This  module  is  designed  for  short  sleeve  environment 
transport  from LEO  to  the Lunar Gateway and back, and  to  transfer  crews between  the 
ISS to any other crewed orbiting infrastructure (see Figure 72). 
 

 

 

Figure 72: OASIS CTV Internal Layout 

 
System  requirements  and  mass  properties  have  been  derived  from  other  OASIS 
elements  as  appropriate.  CTV-unique  system  requirements  and  mass  properties  (e.g., 
for  human  habitability  systems)  have  been  derived  from  the NASA  JSC  Lunar  Transfer 
Vehicle  (LTV)  design  concept  (Crew  Transfer  Vehicle  Element  Conceptual  Design 
Report, EX15-01-094). 
 
Vehicle specifics include, 
•  Normal  mission  duration  of  4.5  days  for  transfer  from  the  ISS  to  the  Lunar 
Gateway (9 day total transfer time from ISS to the Lunar Gateway and back ISS). 
•  Systems shall be sized for a 22-day extended contingency mission. 
•  Crew  of  four  (deemed  sufficient  for  operational  requirements  and  mission 
science). 
•  Vehicle  remains at  ISS and  is designed  to  travel  to Moon L1 and  return  crew  to 
ISS with a one-time return to the surface of the Earth in an emergency situation. 
Internal  volume  shall  be  sufficient  to  meet  NASA  minimal  habitable  threshold 
requirements  of  4.25  m3/person  for  a  22-day  mission  (NASA-STD-3000,  Man-
Systems Integration Standards). 

•

•  Systems  shall  meet  all  other  human  habitability  and  life  support  design 
requirements specified in NASA-STD-3000. 
•  Designed for launch by a Shuttle-class launch vehicle. 

 
A  preliminary  estimate  of  CTV  system mass  is  provided  in  given  in  Table  21  based  on 
derivations  from  the  HPM  and  the  NASA  JSC  Lunar  Transfer  Vehicle.    Note  that  the

9.1.2.2. Habitable Volume Analysis 
From  NASA  Standards  (8.6.2.1  Mission  Duration  Design  Considerations),  the  duration 
of  the  mission  has  an  overall  effect  on  the  required  envelope  geometry.    Increasing 
mission  duration  requires  a  greater  physical  envelope  to  accommodate  mission  tasks 
and  personal  needs.  Crew  accommodation  needs  are  additive,  so  the  total  required 
habitable  volume  per  crewmember  increases  with  mission  duration.  Guidelines  for 
determining  the  amount  of  habitable  volume  per  crewmember  for  varying  mission 
durations are shown in Figure 73. 
 

 
Figure 73: NASA Habitable Volume Standard 8.6.2.1 

 
Initially,  it  was  thought  that  his  standard  would  provide  a  reasonable  approximation  of 
the  total volume  required  for a given mission duration.   However,  it was  thought  that as 
the number of crew  increases,  the habitable volume per crewmember should decrease.  
Therefore,  Figure  74  was  assumed  to  better  approximate  the  habitable  volume 
requirements for a given crew, for a given mission duration.

The habitable volume per person  for  the Apollo Command Module and  the OASIS CTV 
are shown as a reference.  By comparing the masses of various crew modules (Gemini, 
Mercury,  Apollo  CM,  OASIS  CTV  and  Soyuz),  while  holding  the  habitable  volume 
constant, the various architectures were compared. 
 

9.1.2.3. Mass Breakdown Scaling Relationships for OASIS CEV 
Based  on  the  mass  breakdown  described  in  the  OASIS  Report,  each  component 
needed  to  be  considered  independently.    Based  on  the  type  of  component,  its  scaling 
relationship was chosen accordingly. 
 
The  following  components of  the mass breakdown were assumed  to be  independent of 
the number of crew: 
 

1.  Avionics, 
2.  Docking to HPM, 
3.  2nd Docking Interface, and 
4.  Power. 

 
The  following  components  of  the  mass  breakdown  were  assumed  to  scale  in  direct 
proportion with the number of crew: 
 

1.  Crew Gear, 
2.  Crew Weight, and 
3.  Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS). 

 
The  following  components  of  the  mass  breakdown  were  assumed  to  scale  in  direct 
proportion with the external vehicle surface area: 
 

1.  Radiation Protection, 
2.  Structure, 
3.  MMOD, and 
4.  Solar Arrays. 

 
The  following  components  of  the  mass  breakdown  were  assumed  to  scale  in  direct 
proportion with the habitable volume: 
 

1.  Pressure Vessel mass, 
2.  Thermal Control. 
 
A  more  detailed  discussion  of  scaling  is  provided  for  specific  components  of  the  mass 
breakdown.

9.1.2.3.1. Power 
The mass of the Power Systems was derived from the HPM, which consisted of, 
 

•  Propellant  Management  System  (Zero  Boil-off  cryogenic  cooling  system, 
plumbing, instrumentation, data acquisition) – 2777 W 
•  Guidance,  Navigation  and  Control  (scanner,  Inertial  Measurement  Unit  -  IMU)  – 
40 W 
•  Communications  and  Tracking  (flight  computers,  transponders,  solid  state 
recorders) – 103 W 
•  Thermal  Control  System 
(Heaters,  Adhesives,  Controllers,  Thermostats, 
Temperature sensors) – 155 W 
•  Electrical Power System (Power Distribution System) – 505 W 

 
Therefore, a  total average power  level of 3.580 kW was predicted.   When scaling  these 
values  it was assumed that the cryogenic cooling system (the largest power load for the 
propellant  management  system  -  PMS)  was  independent  of  the  number  of  crew.  
However,  the  power  load  will  be  significant  when  in-space  propellant  requirements  are 
specified  later  in  the  project.    The  Guidance,  Navigation  &  Control  (GN&C)  was 
assumed  to  be  independent  of  the  number  of  crew.    This  was  also  assumed  for 
Communications & Tracking System (C&T) and the Electrical Power System (EPS). 
 
As 
the  number  of  crew 
increases, 
the  pressurized  vessel  volume 
increases 
proportionally  (according  to  NASA-STD-3000,  Man-Systems  Integration  Standards).  
Based  on  conduction  heat  transfer,  the  increased  surface  area  permits  increased  heat 
loss  to  the exterior of  the  vehicle.   Since  the heater power  load  is ~5% of  the  total heat 
load,  the  increased  mass  associated  with  a  larger  heating  unit  would  only  slightly 
increase the total mass of the vehicle (on the order of less than 1%). 
 

9.1.2.3.2. Radiation Protection 
A  radiation  protection  layer  is  added  to  the  vehicle  exterior  and  as  such,  its  mass  is 
directly  proportional  to  the  exterior  surface  area  of  the  vehicle.    The  exterior  surface 
area was calculated for the base case (4 crew XTV). 
 
According to Figure 75, the exterior was modeled as the following,

Since many  of  the mass  contributions  are  a  function  of  the  vehicle  surface  area  it  was 
critical  to  calculate  the  approximate  exterior  surface  area.    Since  docking  hatches  and 
other  exterior  attachments  are  located  on  either  end  of  the  vehicle  it was  assumed  that 
only the main cylindrical volume and the lower conical volume contributed to the exterior 
surface area.  Therefore,

The mass of the crew of four XTV, and the mass of the radiation protection material was 
scaled  per  external  surface  area.    Based  on  the  new  vehicle  geometries  required  for  a 
larger number of crew the new radiation protection material mass could be predicted.

9.1.2.3.3. Pressure Vessel 
A surface area relationship was also assumed for the pressure vessel.  However, for the 
pressure vessel, the surface area of the spherical vessel was used and scaled based on 
the habitable volume of the vehicle.  
 

9.1.2.3.4. Structure 
The  materials  proposed  for  the  Hybrid  Propellant  Module  (HPM)  were  described  by 
OASIS  (2002)  and  are  summarized  below.   The materials  for  this module  are  similar  to 
the  materials  proposed  for  the  Crew  Transfer  Vehicle  (CTV).    The  HPM  structural 
system  meets  the  requirements  of  NASA  Standard  5001,  Structural  Design  and  Test 
Factors  of  Safety  for  Space  flight  Hardware.    This  module  can  withstand  the  launch 
loads from a Shuttle-class RLV or an augmented Delta IV-Heavy ELV. 
 
To protect this module and its contents from impacts due to micrometeoroids and orbital 
debris  a  Micrometeoroid  and  Orbital  Debris  Protection  (MMOD)  exterior  shield  was 
proposed.    The  designed  shield  is  capable  of  withstanding  an  impact  with  no 
penetration  from  a  4mm  diameter  aluminum  projectile  with  an  impact  velocity  of  7km/s 
(ISS orbital velocity). 
 
The  longerons  (axial  members)  are  made  from  a  magnesium  metal  matrix  with  long 
fiber  carbon  strands.    This  composite  has  a  structural  I  beam  cross  section  (S20cm-

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      189              

 

15cm),  which  facilitates  the  attachment  of  the  MMOD.    Both  the  upper  and  lower 
sections  contain  these  types  of members.    For  the  upper  section,  the  skin  surrounding 
the shield is made of five layers of Kevlar fabric and epoxy composite.  This serves as a 
stiffener  to  the  main  longeron  and  ring  base  structure.    Space  is  left  for  layers  of 
radiation  protection  of  insulation  for  thermal  protection.    This  section  includes  three 
layers  of  Nextel  ceramic  cloth  that  provides  thermal  protection  (see  Figure  76).    The 
30cm exterior  thickness contains alternating  layers of  low density, open cell  foam.   This 
foam is a carbon-based graphite material with excellent thermal properties. 

(Courtesy of OASIS, 2002) 
Figure 76: HPM upper section material 

 

 
For  the HPM  lower  section,  the  exterior  is  slightly  different.   A Whipple  type  shield was 
chosen  for  the  lower  section  MMOD  shielding  and  thermal  protection  (see  Figure  77).  
The  shield  is made  of  syntactic  aluminum metal  foam  to minimize  the material  density, 
while maintaining sufficient strength.

Figure 77: HPM lower section material 

 

 
Tapered  longerons  were  used  for  the  internal  support  structure  of  the  CEV.    This  was 
done  to  ensure  the  4-G  load  (HPM  thrusting)  could  be  sustained.    The  upper  half  was 
untapered to maximize volume  in the unpressurized area.  It was also expected that the 
maximum loading during docking would be light. 
 
The  CTV MMOD  shield  design  is  conceptually  similar  to  the  HPM MMOD  shield.    This 
section  incorporates  an  expandable  multi-shock  design,  which  is  deployed  on-orbit.  

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      190              

 

Non-expandable  syntactic  aluminum  foam  is  used  on  the  upper  section  to  avoid 
potential  complications  with  shield  deployment  around  externally  mounted  systems 
(including solar arrays and radiators). 
 
The number of  longerons supporting  the XTV structure was 8  (crew of 4).   Therefore,  it 
was  assumed  that  the  number  of  members  was  directly  proportional  to  the  exterior 
surface  area.    To  a  first  order  approximation,  buckling  scales  well  with  surface  area, 
provided  additional  ring  supports  could  be  added where  necessary.    This  provides  only 
a minor mass penalty and since the structural load per circumferential length will remain 
the same, this is a good assumption.  It was assumed that the ring structure attached to 
each  member  also  scales  with  the  surface  area.    This  is  a  reasonable  assumption,  as 
the support members constitute a greater portion of  the  total structural mass  (assuming 
the same material is used for vertical members and ring base structure). 
 

9.1.2.3.5. Micrometeoroid and Orbital Debris (MMOD) 
This exterior protective structure was assumed to scale with the exterior vehicle surface 
area in a similar manner as the Radiation Protection layer. 
 

9.1.2.3.6. Secondary Structure (20%) 
Similar  to Radiation  Protection  and  the MMOD,  the  Secondary  Structure was  assumed 
to scale with the exterior vehicle surface area. 
 

9.1.2.3.7. Solar Arrays 
Assumed to scale with the exterior vehicle surface area. 
 

9.1.2.3.8. Thermal Control 
At  this stage of  the analysis  it was assumed  that  the Thermal Control mass scaled with 
the  volume  of  the  pressurized  vessel.    This  seems  reasonable  as  the  pressurized 
volume scales with the number of crew (NASA-STD-3000 90). 
 
Each of  the components was scaled according  to  the parameters specified above.   The 
original  vehicle  proportions  were  maintained  when  the  size  was  increased.    Details  of 
the vehicle proportions can be found in the Section 9.1.1.

9.1.2.4. Mass Breakdown Scaling Relationships for Apollo Command Module 
A  similar  analysis  was  performed  for  the  Apollo  Command  Module  (CM)  as  was 
performed for the OASIS CEV. 
 
The command module was approximated by a conical structure.   The pressurized  inner 
shell  was  fabricated  from  aluminum  honeycomb  panels  and  separated  from  the  heat-
resistant outer shell by a micro-quartz fiber insulator. 
 
The external surface area (see Figure 78) was calculated as,

9.1.3 Elements of the Heavy Cargo Shuttle Derived Vehicles Study 

• 

9.1.3.1 Useful Definitions 
•  A5G: Ariane 5 “Generique”. It is the reference European commercial launcher. 
•  ET: External Tank. It is the external tank where de LH2 and LO2 are stored in 
the shuttle. 
Isp:  Specific  impulse.  It  is  a  measure  of  the  performance  of  an  engine- 
propellant  combination.  For  a  given  system,  it  increases  with  altitude  and  is 
maximum  at  vacuum.  It  is  measured  in  seconds.  If  you  have  a  kg  of 
propellant  and  you  burn  it  to  produce  1  kg  of  thrust,  the  Isp  is  the  number  of 
seconds it lasts. 
•  SRB: Solid Rocket Booster. Has a lot of thrust but low Isp, good for lifting off. 
•  J2: high energy LH2 LO2 upper stage from the Saturn 5 third stage. 
•  SL: Sea level 
•  P/L: Payload 
•  LEO:  Low  Earth  Orbit,  an  orbit  between  150  to  1000  km  over  the  Earth 
surface. Unless otherwise stated, it is assumed to be of 280 km. 
•  Mission  delta-V: The  sum  of  the  ideal  delta-V  needed  for  a  particular mission 
plus all the other velocity losses. 
•  SSME:  Space  Shuttle  Main  Engine,  it  uses  liquid  H2  and  liquid  O2.  It  has  a 
high Isp but it is expensive and complicated. 
•  RS68: Main  engine  of  the Delta  IV  common  core,  it  uses  liquid H2  and  liquid 
O2,  it  has  a  lower  Isp  than  SSME  and  it  is  not  human-rated,  but  it  is  cheaper 
and simpler. 
•  STS:  Space  Transportation  System.  It  is  the whole  system  commonly  known 
as shuttle. 
•  Pod:  Canister  where  the  payload  is  stored  in  an  STS-derived  heavy  launch 
vehicle. 

9.1.3.2. Assumptions 
Isp of the SRB is constant and average between SL and vacuum. 
• 
•  Pod weights 10000kg. 
Isp  of  SSME  and  RS68  is  equal  to  the  SL  value  while  the  SRBs  burn  and 
• 
equal to the vacuum value afterwards. 
•  Massflow is constant for each engine. 
•  SSME can be throttled to 109% of the nominal thrust at lift off. 
•  The  Isp  during  parallel  burn  is  the  weighted  average  using  the  massflow  rate 
as the weight. 
Inline and piggyback configurations of STS-derived heavy launch vehicles are 
considered equivalent. 
•  The  gravity,  turning,  and  aerodynamic  losses  are  the  same  for  all  STS-
derived vehicles. 
•  The  payload  mass  to  LEO  assumes  a  total  delta-v  (including  all  losses)  of 
9,400 m/s,  the mass  to  ISS assumes  total delta-v of 9,600 m/s, and  the mass 
to escape assumes delta-v of 11,600 m/s

9.1.3.3. Missions with Minimal Hardware Development 
No high-energy second stage would be developed or revived. 

9.1.3.3.1. Launch Sequence 
•  Parallel burn of the SSMEs (or RS68s) and SRBs for 123 seconds 
•  SRB separation. 
•  SSMEs (or RS68) continue to burn until they ran out of propellant. 
•  SSMEs (or RS68) and ET separate 
•  Payload separates from the Pod.

The most attractive combination for heavy cargo launch is 3RS68, 2SRB and a J2 class 
upper stage. 
It has 1 engine out capability.  
• 
It uses RS68 which are not human rated and therefore cheap. 
• 
It matches nicely with the NASA Mars reference human mission v. 3.0 
• 

 

9.1.4. EELV assessment 
The  Evolved  Expendable  Launch  Vehicle  program  (EELV)  is  the  backbone  of  the  US 
defense  related  launch  complex.  It  includes  two  families  of  launchers  the  Delta  IV  by 
Boeing  and  the  Atlas  V  by  Lockheed  Martin.  Although  commercially  uncompetitive  the 
Delta  IV  and  the  Atlas  V  have  the  monopoly  of  the  medium  heavy  defense  related 
payloads in the USA. For this strategic reason, the continuity of both programs is almost 
guaranteed.  The  capacity  of  production  is  about  10  a  year  for  each  vehicle.    Existing 
EELV  designs  are  modular  and  the  Atlas  V  and  Delta  IV  families  have  similar 
performance  envelopes,  although  the  Delta  IV  has  a  higher  specific  impulse  because 
instead of using kerosene it burns hydrogen in the fist stage.  
 
In  the  framework of  the new human exploration  initiative  there are  two potential uses of 
EELV launchers, one is cargo and the other one is human transportation. 
 
Concerning  cargo  there  are  two  approaches  that  can  be  based  solely  on  EELV 
technology. One  is  to use  the Delta  IV Heavy  to  launch  the heavy exploration payloads 
in  pieces  of  about  20000  kg.  This  approach  has  been  studied  in Section  6.4.2.2.2.  The 
other approach  is  to develop a new heavy  launcher based on Delta  IV  technology. One 
such  concept  could  be  a Delta-IV with  five  common  booster  cores  (instead  of  the  three

used on  the Delta  IV Heavy) and a J2 class upper stage. We will refer to  it as Delta –IV 
Super. The Delta  IV  is assembled horizontally,  that would not be possible  for  the Delta-
IV Super,  and  substantial  changes  in  the way  that  the  launcher  is  assembled would  be 
required. According to our calculations this option promises payload capabilities that are 
slightly  inferior  to  those with an STS based architecture. A Delta-IV super would  require 
new infrastructure and more development work than an STS based launcher to arrive at 
a  lower  performance.  From  our  simplified  analysis  it  seems  that  it  is  a  less mature  and 
technically inferior option than to use the current EELV fleet or an STS derived. 
 
Concerning  human  transportation  it  should  be  first  noted  that  the  EELVs  were  not 
conceived to send humans, but classified payloads and commercial telecommunications 
satellites  instead.  The  fact  that  the  vehicles  are  not  man  rated  does  not  mean  that  it 
cannot  be  done  very  effectively;  as  an  example:  the  most  family  of  vehicles  that  has 
ever been used  to  launch humans,  the Soyuz (originally  the R7 missile), was conceived 
to launch thermonuclear warheads. 
 
The  launch  pads  would  have  to  be  modified  to  allow  for  the  access  and  escape  of 
astronauts.  This  would  however  be  less  costly  than  designing  new  launch  pads  from 
scratch. 
 
Table 25 shows some characteristics that have been calculated for EELV vehicles.

9.1.5 Solid Rocket Booster derived launcher considerations 
 
It  has  been  argued  that  a  single  Solid  Rocket  Booster  (SRB)  is  a  viable  alternative  to 
launch  humans.  In  this  section  we  will  evaluate  the  attractiveness  of  using  SRBs  to 
launch crews. 
 
The  concept  has  some  advantages.  First,  the  vehicle  components  are  already  human 
rated  since  they are used on  the STS.   Second  there has been only one SRB  failure of 
in  113  flights.  That  is  a  99.5%  reliability,  which  is  similar  to  that  of  the  Soyuz.  Another 
advantage  is  that  it  supports  the  business  of  ATK  Thiokol,  a  critical  supplier  of  the 
strategic nuclear forces of the USA. 
 
It should be noted though that the reliability of an SRB as a part of an STS stack cannot 
be simply assumed to be preserved in an SRB based launch system.  
 
This concept would require new launch pads and ground infrastructure, 
 
A concern  that  is often  raised up  is  the environmental effect of  the SRB plumes. Due  to 
the  low  flight  rate  (in  any  case  less  than  12  a  year)  that we  expect  for  the  program, we 
consider that effect to be minor. 
 
A  more  serious  concern  is  the  safety  of  the  use  and  storage  of  stages  that  are 
constantly fully loaded with explosive. An explosion of an SRB in the VAB would be very 
damaging  and  it  is  a  scenario  that,  although  unlikely  would  be  catastrophic.  Naturally 
this applies to the STS derived launcher because it uses SRBs too. 
 
 
A study of the capabilities of various combinations of the SRB with different high energy 
cryogenic upper stages has been performed and is summarized in Table 26:

All masses shown  in  the  table are  in kilograms. The payload mass has been calculated 
assuming  no  fairing  and  no  escape  system.  It  should  be  pointed  out  that SRB with S-II 
combination  involves  a  rather  unusual  geometry  and mass  distribution,  the  diameter  of 
the  second  stage  being  2.75  (10.2/3.71)  times  than  that  of  the SRB.  The  aerodynamic, 
structural  and  control  problems  that  such  a  configuration  would  have  are  at  first  sight 
very large however its assessment is beyond the scope of this report. 
 
An  important  concern  using  this  vehicle  is  the  peak  acceleration.  Since  the  SRB  has  a 
very  high  thrust  to  weight  ratio  a  very  heavy  mass  would  have  to  be  launched  every 
time  that  an  SRB  based  vehicle  is  used  to  launch  humans.  To  keep  the  STS 
requirement  of  less  than  3  g  is  not  necessary  since,  in  the  context  of  the  new 
exploration missions,  it will not be  claimed  that almost anybody  can use  the  system, as 
was  the case on  the shuttle. 5 g  is a more  reasonable  threshold. The minimum payload 
in LEO compatible with an acceleration of 6g has been calculated to be 47000 kg for a 5 
g limit, 74500 kg for a 4 g limit and 116,000 kg for a 3g limit. Comparing these minimum 
masses  to  the payload masses with  the various upper stages show  that  the only option 
that  would  have  an  acceleration  of  less  than  5  g would  be  the  SRB  plus  S-II  stage.  As 
has already being commented  that option has problems  in  its geometrical configuration. 
This problem would not be easily dealt with  just by designing a new upper  stage with a 
different geometry. Actually, the S-II is quite a slender body. The physical reason can be 
traced back  to  the different  in density of  the propellants used  in  the SRB and  the upper 
stages. Due  to  the  very  low  density  of  liquid  hydrogen,  cryogenic  stages  occupy  a  very 
large  volume.  If  the  diameter  of  an  upper  stage  where  reduced  by  a  30%  the  diameter 
of  the  SRB  then,  to  preserve  the  volume,  the  length  of  the  stage  would  have  to  be 
increased by a 57% making then the second stage longer than the SRB.  
 
This consideration renders the use of a single SRB to launch astronauts troublesome.

9.1.6 Penalty of 1kg 
The  effect  on  the  final  P/L  mass  of  1kg  of  inert  mass  placed  on  a  stage  has  been 
evaluated  for  a  typical  LEO  mission  for  both  an  A5G  and  an  STS-derived  that  used

9.1.7 STS derived assembly platform 
For  missions  requiring  on  orbit  assembly,  such  as  large  Moon  missions  or  any  Mars 
missions,  it may be useful  to have an assembly platform with a  robotic arm. Using STS 
legacy  hardware,  this  capability  could  be  achieved  rather  easily.  To  be  able  to  launch 
such a platform the STS Based has to be side mounted. It should be  launched on a  low 
inclination  LEO.  External  Tank  Corporation  studied  the  development  of  a  space  station 
using  the  external  tank  as  living  quarters  and  a  modified  orbiter  such  as  the  one  that 
would  be  needed  for  this  assembly  platform.  The  cost  was  estimated  to  be  $3  billion 
FY92.

9.1.8 LabView tool for evaluating launch capabilities 

9.1.8.1  Introduction 
 
The  tool  described  in  this  Appendix was  developed  in  LabView,  and  provided  a way  to 
evaluate  launch  capabilities  that  could  be  considered  for  crew  or  cargo  launch.  Two 
types  of  analysis  can  be  done:  a  combinatorial  evaluation  of  the  possible  architectures 
 
and an evaluation of a single architecture selected by the user. 
 
9.1.8.2. Evaluation of a single architecture 
 
Figure  84  shows  a  view  of  the  graphical  user  interface.  The  following  paragraph 
describes how  to use  this simulation  tool, and  the  results  it generates  for  the evaluation 
of a single user-defined architecture. 
 

-  Step 1: The user enters the parameters available for each option: 
o  masses,  TRL  and  rank  for  the  EDL  technology,  the  habitable module  and 
the launch escape system 
mass capability of lift for the first stages (4th and 5th rows of  
o  Figure 84) 
-  Step  2:  The  user  selects  one  of  each  option  (knowing  that  all  the  combinations 
between  rows  are  not  always  possible)  with  the  help  of  the  rectangular  select 
button on the right. 
Step 3: The user runs the simulation to obtain the results, which are displayed in the bottom - 
right corner of  
Figure 84. 

 
The program outputs include,

•  The average TRL for the selected architecture as well as the lowest 
TRL among the selected options of this architecture; 
•  The  mass  margins  for  launch  capabilities  for  ISS  and  28.8  deg 
destinations,  as  well  as  the  mass  margin  for  the  escape  system. 
The  mass  margin  is  defined  as  the  extra  mass  that  the  launcher 
could launch in addition of the crew module. Note that in this part of 
the  study,  no  care was  taken  of  separating  human-rated  and  cargo 
launches; 
•  The rank of the crew module architecture; 
•  The reliability of the launch system in percentage.

9.1.8.3. Combinatorial evaluation of the possible architectures 
The advantage of using LabView was also in that it enabled evaluation of all the combinations for 
each option of CEV (+ EDL + crew escape system) and launcher.

Figure  85  shows  the  result  of  such  a  simulation.  LabView  evaluated,  for  999  different 
architectures,  the  mass  margin  to  ISS  in  kg.  The  mass  margin  is  defined  as  the  extra 
mass  that  the  launcher  could  launch  in  addition  of  the  crew  module.  For  some 
architecture,  the  mass  margin  is  negative,  which  means  that  the  selected  launcher 
couldn’t lift the selected crew module. On this graph, too, some gaps are presented (red 
arrows) and  the  corresponding  launch  technologies, which enabled  launching  the mass 
(3RS68+2SRB, Delta IV super, 3SSME+2SRB). 
 
For the final decision of a launch system, not only the masses (given by this model), but 
also cost and feasibility issues should be looked at, these are not included in this model.

9.2.2 Habitation Module 

9.2.2.1 Crew Size and Composition 
Mission duration  is critical when determining  the size of  the crew compartment.   As well 
as  the  size  of  the  vehicle,  the  number  of  crew  is  an  important  decision  based  on  group 
dynamics, science/research  requirements and vehicle design  limitations.   Human  factor 
requirements  such  as  habitable  volume,  crew  health  &  safety,  food  &  waste 
management,  and  thermal  &  power  requirements  dictate  much  of  the  vehicle  design 
and the structural aspects of the vehicle are determined by these requirements. 
 
A  long  duration  mission,  such  as  one  to  Mars  and  back  poses  many  new  challenges 
that  have  not  been  the  focus  of  earlier  human  exploration  initiatives  like  Apollo.    The 
size  and  composition  of  the  crew  is  an  extremely  important  factor  based  on 
psychological and sociological aspects of such a mission.    Important  factors  to consider 
are summarized from an earlier MIT study in 16.851 Satellite Engineering (2003).  Large 
crews  tend  to  have  lower  levels  of  deviance  and  conflict  and  this  tends  to  decline  with 
increasing  mission  duration.    Also,  heterogeneous  crews  have  lower  rates  of  deviance 
and  conflict  (Dudley-Rowley,  2002).    This  same  investigation  indicated  that  the  least 
dysfunction  of  any  crew  studies  was  a  crew  of  nine  people.    Since  a  short  duration 
mission  will  have  the  crew  anticipating  their  return  in  the  short  term,  long-term  group 
dynamics are less of an issue. 
 
Gender,  ethnic  and  cultural  make-up  is  an  important  factor  for  long  mission  durations.  
More  heterogeneous  crews  begin  a  mission  with  some  deviance,  conflict  and 
dysfunction,  but  this  tends  to  decrease  as  the  mission  progresses.    The  opposite  is 
observed  for  a  homogeneous  crew, whereby  deviance,  conflict  and  dysfunction  tend  to 
be  initially  less  than  a  heterogeneous  crew,  but  increase  as  the  mission  progresses 
(Dudley-Rowley, 2002). 
 
As  was  discussed  in  an  earlier  section,  the  interior  “free”  space  for  a  crew  is  important 
and  should  be  sufficiently  large  for  long-term  mission  durations.    This  results  in 
increased performance and mental health. 
 

9.2.2.2. Life Support Systems 
Equipment  necessary  to  keep  the  crew  alive  must  be  extremely  reliable  and  robust  to 
external perturbation.   This equipment  involves a galley & food system, waste collection 
system,  personal  hygiene,  clothing,  recreational  equipment,  housekeeping,  operational 
supplies, maintenance, sleep provisions, and health care. 
 
The  pressurized  spacecraft  must  have  the  appropriate  temperature,  pressure,  and 
atmosphere,  as  well  as  control  over  disturbances  from  living  organisms.    According  to 
Larson  (1999), open  loop  life  support  systems  (carry  food, water and oxygen on board) 
are reliable, but are  limited by mission duration (cost and volume occupation).   An open

loop  system  processes  waste  products  and  recovers  useful  resources.    However,  the 
disadvantage are; development costs, power requirements, reliability and maintainability 
(Larson, 1999). 
 
The  functions  of  a  life  support  system  involve  managing  atmosphere  (pressure, 
temperature,  humidity,  removal  of  contaminants,  composition  and  ventilation),  water 
(provide, monitor,  process  and  store  for  hygiene  and  drinking), waste  (collect,  process, 
store) and food (provide, store and prepare) (Larson, 1999). 

9.2.2.2.1. ECLSS Atmosphere Management 
Deciding  which  technology  to  select  depends  largely  on  the  characteristics  of  the  crew 
size, mission  duration  and mission  location.    For  long-duration missions,  hygiene water 
will  likely  dominate  design  decisions  on  sizing  the  ECLSS  (Larson,  1999).    An 
atmosphere  management  system  suggested  by  HSMAD  consists  of  4BMS  (4-bed 
molecular  sieve),  TCCS,  and  Sabatier  P/C  atmosphere  management  system  (see 
Table 28).

A flow chart of the processes used to manage the atmosphere is shown in Figure 86.

A  triple  redundant  system  was  selected,  which  consisted  of  the  three  systems  listed 
earlier.  The resultant mass was multiplied by a factor of three for redundancy (Wieland, 
1999).  This results in an overall mass and volume per crewmember (CM) of 255 kg/CM 
and 1 m3, respectively.

9.2.2.2.2. ECLSS Water Management 
A  P/C  water  management  system  of  vapor  compression  distillation  (VCD)  was 
presented  in  the  Mars  mission  design  example  in  HSMAD.    A  flow  chart  of  the  water 
recovery and management is shown in Figure 87. 
 

 
Figure 87: Water recovery and management (Wieland, 1999) 

 

 
Two water management  systems were  selected,  bringing  the  total mass  and  volume  to 
50  kg/CM  and  a  volume  of  0.2m3/CM  (Wieland,  1999).    The  ECLSS  atmosphere  and 
water  management  systems  were  predicted  for  various  crew  sizes.    The  method  of 
scaling was  similar  to  the method  described  earlier  in  the Report,  in which  the mass  of 
the ECLSS was scaled as being directly proportional  to  the number of crew  (see Figure 
88).

9.2.2.3. Radiation Protection 
For  missions  more  distant  than  geosynchronous  Earth  orbit,  the  Earth's  magnetic  field 
does  not  provide  protection  and  radiation  from  the  Sun,  especially  during  solar  storms 
(during  a  Mars  mission),  and  galactic  cosmic  radiation  (Wieland,  1999).  Since  a  crew 
will  leave  the Earth’s  atmosphere  on  a mission  from Earth  to Mars,  radiation  protection 
from  high-energy  sun  particles  is  required.    Background  space  radiation,  such  as 
galactic cosmic rays (GCR) may also influence crew health during the mission to Mars. 
 
The  radiation  dose  limit  is  used  to  predict  the  hull  thickness.    Typically,  spacecraft 
radiation  wall  thickness  is  determined  by  the  wall  thickness  that  does  not  permit  the 
radiation  dose  limit.    As  such,  a  radiation  dose  of  1  Gy  requires  an  aluminum  hull 
thickness of 1.5cm (Larson, 1999). 
 
Distinctions  were  presented  between 
the 
for 
the  crew  habitat 
the  design  of 
interplanetary space travel and ones for the Mars surface (Cohen, 1996).  This is known 
as  the  “Being  There  Versus  Getting  There”  philosophy  that  argues  that  interplanetary 
and  surface  capabilities are  fundamentally  so different  that  it  is not possible  to optimize 
them within a single set of habitation elements. Cohen indicates that “radiation shielding 
is the most overlooked feature of proposed  interplanetary vehicles” and that “NASA and 
space  industry mission  planners  consistently  underestimate  the  radiation  hazards  on  a 
trip  to  Mars,  particularly  from  GCRs  and  thus  minimize  the  shielding  to  protect  against 
this exposure.”   Cohen indicates that the shielding requirements form radiation hazards 
in  interplanetary  space  indicates  the  need  for  substantial  omni  directional  shielding  on 
the order of 30g/cm2. 
 
It  may  be  possible  to  extract  shielding  for  the  Mars  surface  habitat  from  the  Martian 
surface,  which  indicates  that  the  mass  penalty  of  carrying  sufficient  shielding  for  the 
Martian  surface  habitat  from  Earth  is  unnecessary  (Cohen,  1996).    By  having  a  small 
“solar  storm  shelter”  in  the  crew  transport  vehicle,  the  overall  radiation  protection mass 
would be reduced, however this comes at the expense of close crew quarters, which as 
discussed  earlier,  affects  group  dynamics.    From  multiple  standpoints,  providing 
radiation protection for the entire crew vehicle is critical to the success of the mission. 
 
Since  a  sphere  has  a minimum  ratio  of  surface  area  to  volume  for  any  solid,  as  closely 
approximating  this  shape  reduces  the  overall  radiation  shielding  mass.    According  to 
Cohen,  the shielding can either be solid, as  in  the  form of solid aluminum gore panel or 
liquid,  as  in  water  to  pump  into  interior  perimeter  tanks.    Cohen  also  indicates  that 
“whatever  the shielding,  it makes no sense  to waste  the effort, cost and energy  that put 
it in LEO by landing it on Mars as part of a multi-purpose habitat.” 
 
In ISS orbit, roughly half the radiation dosage comes from trapped protons and half from 
Galactic  Cosmic  Rays  (GCR).    As  well,  the  flux  of  low-energy  GCRs  is  inversely 
proportional  to  solar  activity  and  Solar  Particle  Events  (SPEs)  are  mostly  low-energy 
protons  (30-120 MeV)  and  are more  common  at  solar maximum.    Since  SPEs  vary  so 
much  in  size,  it’s  hard  to  design  a  spacecraft  that will  be  totally  immune  to  their  effects 
(Larson, 1999).

9.2.2.4. Power Systems 
This information was summarized from Larson (1999). 
 
A  spacecraft  needs  continuous  housekeeping  power  to  operate  and  support  guidance, 
navigation, and attitude control, telemetry downlink, active thermal control, the computer 
system,  and  crew  needs  –  circulating  atmosphere,  lighting,  cabin  heat,  etc.    Consider 
the following housekeeping power requirements: 
•  Apollo Command Module – less than 2 kW 
•  Skylab space station – about 4 kW 
International Space Station – about 36 kW 
• 
•  For  a Mars mission,  the  baseline  (or  continuous)  power  needed  is  estimated 
30 kW-50kW for transfer vehicles. 

 

9.2.2.4.1. Earth and lunar orbit constraints 
The power system must withstand thermal cycling because of the short 35-minute orbits.  
Solar  power  systems  should  be  able  to  store  energy  and  account  for  radiation  in  low-
Earth orbits.

9.2.2.4.2. Solar Photovoltaics (PV) 
PV  arrays  consist  of  solar  cells  with  transparent  covers  to  protect  the  cells  from 
radiation.    Arrays  may  mount  directly  on  the  spacecraft’s  body  without  deployment  or 
pointing.    This  option  limits  the  array  area  and  may  compromise  thermal  control.    The 
power  produced  from  a  given  area  of  solar  array  from  the  power-conversion  efficiency 
is: 

F Aη
Sun
p

P
 
where, ΦSun = [1368/d2] is the flux of sunlight at a distance d (in astronomical units) from 
the Sun, η  the conversion efficiency  that  is dependent on  the solar cell  type chosen  (for 
silicon  cells  used  on  International  Space  Station  about  η=.145),  Fp  the  fraction  of  the 
array  actually  covered  by  solar  cells  (85-90%),  and  θ  the  angle  of  the  array  normal  to 
the Sun. 
 
The  solar  array  blanket  mass  is  the  mass  of  the  solar  cells,  including  cover  glass  and 
interconnects,  and  the  substrate  on  which  the  cells  are  mounted  but  does  not  include 
the  structural  mass,  array  orientation  motors,  or  the  deployment  and  packaging  mass.  
Because  of  the  difference  between  the  “standard”  efficiency  and  actual  delivered  to  the 
user,  the  load  power  output  is  about  33%  of  the  array’s  output  in  nominal  sunlit 
conditions.    Typical  blanket  mass  per  unit  area  is  1.7  kg/m2  for  silicon.    The  blanket 
mass  is  typically  about  55%  of  the  array’s  total  mass  marray.    The  drive  mechanism’s 
estimated mass mdrive is a function of the array’s mass marray (in kilograms) from

      214              

 

 
mdrive = |-.014marray + 20.6|*marray/100. 
 
The  launch  volume  depends  on  the  technology  chosen  and  the  packaging.    The  rough 
estimate  for  the  total  packaged  volume  for  a  solar  array  is  0.05m3  per m2  of  the  array’s 
total area. 
 

9.2.2.4.3. Solar Dynamic and Nuclear Systems 
Solar  thermal  systems  (known  as  solar  dynamic,  or  SD)  are  predicted  to  have  lower 
specific  mass  and  cost  for  high  power  (>100  kWe)  applications.    Nuclear  systems  may 
be  preferable  for  long  eclipse,  high-power  missions  such  as  large  lunar  base;  and 
missions  requiring  low,  long-term  continuous  power  such  as missions  with  low  sunlight 
intensity.    All  thermal-conversion  (SD  and  nuclear)  require  radiators  to  reject  the waste 
heat, which account for much of the system’s mass and area. 
 
The  baseline  SP-100  reactor  can  produce  100  kWe  of  electrical  power  with  a  specific 
power  of  30  We/kg  and  a  7  year  life-span.  The  shielding  requirements  to  protect  the 
crew  and  payload  from  the  radiation  produced  by  a  nuclear  power  system  can  be  a 
large  fraction of  the power system’s mass.   A  reactor system  is  typically not  radioactive 
until  energized.    The  reactor  should  be  launched  from  Earth  un-powered  to  allow 
handling on the pad. 
   

9.2.2.4.4. Energy Storage 
One primary option is the hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell, which reacts hydrogen with oxygen 
to produce electricity and water.  Fuel cells produce high energy per unit reaction mass, 
but  are  less  compact  and  more  complex  (requiring  storage  of  hydrogen  and  oxygen) 
than other batteries.  
 
The  cell’s  mass  is  proportional  to  the  power  level  required,  and  the  mass  of  the 
reactants  is  directly  proportional  to  the  power  required  times  the  mission  length.    For 
example, the Shuttle’s system has three primary fuel cells that provide a total of 14 kWe.  
Each  fuel  cell  has  a  mass  of  91  kg.    Together,  the  three  cells  use  about  150  kg  of 
hydrogen and oxygen per day. 
 

9.2.2.5. Thermal Control 
This information was summarized from Larson (1999). 
 
The  thermal  control  system  must  maintain  comfortable  and  a  uniform  temperature 
distribution  for  the  crew,  other  systems  and  equipment.   As well,  the  thermal  protection 
system  provides  the  first  line  of  defense  by  shielding  from  extreme  heat  sources  and 
sinks (sun and deep space, respectively)

Active thermal control implies movement of mass, information or energy.  This is usually 
some  type  of  loop  to  circulate  fluids.    This  allows  convective  heat  transfer  to  augment 
conduction  and  radiation.    Passive  thermal  control  involves  conduction  through  the 
spacecraft  and  radiation  from  its  surface  to  dissipate  heat  and  keep  temperatures 
relatively low.  Geometric design and layout, insulation, heaters, heat pipes, and louvers 
are  common  passive  techniques  that  aid  in  maintaining  all  parts  of  the  spacecraft  at 
acceptable temperatures. 
 

9.2.2.5.1. Design of Thermal Control System 
Depending  on  the  mission,  the  mission  phases  each  contribute  unique  thermal 
requirements.    After  considering  a  particular mission,  examine  the  phases  (Table  16-2, 
Larson, 1999) and complete the following design iteration (Table 16-1, Larson, 1999). 
 

1.  Determine  mission  requirements  -  sum  heat  loads  of  electrical  equipment 
(typically  half  of  total  heat  load  for  transfer  vehicles.    Assumed  to  be  100%  of 
electrical  energy  becomes  thermal  energy), metabolic  (human  production), walls 
(gains or leaks), other. 
2.  Establish temperature requirements for crew and cargo 
3.  Select the thermal protection system (determine materials) 
4.  Decide which systems can have passive control 
5.  Size  heat  transport  loops  and  heat  sinks  with  an  appropriate  fluid  maximum 
temperature 
6.  Determine the architecture to connect all actively cooled heat sources to the heat 
sinks. 
7.  Calculate size and capacity of other components 
8.  Estimate mass, power, volume 
9.  Iterate 

 
Various mission phases are described in HSMAD (Table 16-2, HSMAD). 
 

1.  Pre-launch – Most vehicle systems require cooling 
2.  LEO – Avoid sun and Earth view  to  radiators.   May  include docking with another 
craft. 
3.  Earth entry – Significant heat gains through walls 
4.  Lunar Transit – Environment may get cold 
5.  Lunar Surface – Hot during day, cold at night (surface dust) 
6.  Mars Transit – Environment may be cold (Microgravity) 
7.  Mars Surface – Surface dust, winds, pressure limited expendable heat sinks. 

 
Typical heat  rejection values of space  radiators are given  in Table 16-4  (Larson, 1999).  
Note that some of the rejection systems are not suitable for long-term missions because 
significant degradation will take place over time. 
 
Thermal  control  fundamentals  include  convection,  conduction  and  radiation.    These 
three  heat  transfer  processes  are  used  in  some  form  to  control  the  temperature  of  the

spacecraft  interior.    Table  16-7  (Larson,  1999)  discusses  the  masses,  power  and 
volume of the components of a thermal control system. 
 
The  Moon  temperatures  range  from  100K  to  400K  because  there  is  no  moderating 
atmosphere.   The  radiators  on  the Moon  can  be  as  low  as  3K  (facing  deep  space)  and 
as  high  as  325K  (vertical  at  the  equator  at  noon).    The  interplanetary  thermal 
environment  is  generally  cold,  dominated  by  solar  radiation  and  deep  space.    In  this 
environment, simple radiators, facing away from the Sun, are very effective.  
 
Radiant  heat  exchange  dominates  the  Martian  thermal  environment,  but  a  thin  CO2 
environment  helps  transfer  heat  through  conduction  and  convection.    High  velocity 
winds  stir  up  huge  dust  storms  that  block  radiation.    Surface  temperature  of  Mars  can 
range from 130K to 300K. 
 

9.2.2.5.2. Entry Heating 
Radiative  and  absorptive  systems  are  the  two  basic  external  types  used  to  dissipate 
entry heating.  Radiative typically dissipates 80-90% of the heating.  Absorptive systems 
absorb  the  heat  through  heat  sinks,  ablation,  or  transpiration.    Ablation  is  a  self-
regulating  transfer  of  heat  and  mass  in  which  material  absorbs  entry  heating  then 
degrades.   Transpiration means  injecting  a  fluid  through  the  skin  of  the  vehicle  into  the 
boundary layer to provide cooling. 
 
Radiative  thermal  protection  systems  are  limited  to  about  1370ºC.    This  is  a  passive 
system  and  usually  does  not  involve mass  loss  or  shape  change.    Absorptive  systems 
absorb heat  through a phase change, chemical change,  temperature rise, or convective 
or  transpiration  cooling.    These  systems  are  typically  more  complex  and  weigh  more 
than  radiative  systems.    If  the  material  burns  up,  we  can  use  the  system  only  once.  
However,  absorptive  systems  can  handle  the  high  heating  rates  from  velocities  needed 
for planetary travel or missile entry.

9.2.2.5.3. Heat Sinks for Short Duration Missions 
For  short-duration  missions,  heat  sinks  can  be  used  as  an  active  method  of  thermal 
control.  Since fluids like water or ammonia absorb a tremendous amount of heat during 
phase  change,  and  the  space  environment  is  conducive  too  this  (near  vacuum),  the 
approximate mass of expendable heat sink required for this is, 
QD
. 
M =
e
h
fg
Me = heat sink mass (kg), 
Q  = required heat rejection rate (kW) 
D  = mission duration (s), and 
hfg = latent heat of vaporization (kJ/kg). 

 
Table  16-3  (Larson,  1999)  should  be  consulted  for  general  guidelines  for  using 
expendable  heat  sinks  instead  of  radiators,  and  Table  16-10  (Larson,  1999)  for  the 
latent heats of vaporization for commonly used fluids. 
 
Thermal  capacitors  are  short  duration  heat  sinks.    Using  the  same  principle  of 
evaporative  cooling,  elements  can  be  “cold-soaked”,  which  when  heated,  will  cool  the 
element.    This  technique  incurs  only  a  very  small mass  penalty  (only  the  weight  of  the 
fluid  soaking  the  element),  however  a  complex  analysis  is  required  to  model  this 
transient heat transfer. 
 

9.2.2.5.4. Internal Thermal Control System 
This  thermal  control  system  gathers  all  of  the  heat  loads  from  within  the  pressurized 
volume  (cabin  or  module),  including  those  collected  directly  from  equipment  through 
heat exchangers and cold plates. 
 
The  internal  thermal  control  system  must  cool  the  cabin  air  heat  exchanger  to  control 
humidity and temperature (see ECLSS Report).  A coolant capable of removing the heat 
from the cabin must be selected.  An important consideration is the crew’s safety should 
the coolant  leak.   Water  is often selected, however  it  is critical  that  temperatures do not 
fall  below  freezing.    It  may  also  be  necessary  to  insulate  plumbing,  cold  plates,  and 
other surfaces that operate below the air’s dew point temperature. 

 

 

9.2.2.5.5. Thermal Control Components 
1.  Electric heaters are used in cold-biased equipment, controlled by thermostats.

2.  Space  radiators  are  heat  exchangers  on  outer  surface  that  radiates  heat  into 
space. 
3.  Cold  plates  are  structural  mounts  using  convective  transfer  for  electrical 
equipment. 
4.  Doublers  are  passive  aluminum  plates  that  increase  the  heat  exchange  surface 
area. 
5.  Phase change devices are used to generate heat in short bursts. 
6.  Louvers shield radiator surfaces to moderate heat flow to space. 

 
Additional considerations for human space flight can be found in Larson (1999). 

 

9.2.2.6. Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) 

9.2.2.6.1. Introduction 
ADCS  stabilizes  the  vehicle  and  orients  it  in  desired  directions  during  the  mission 
despite  the  disturbance  torques  acting  on  it.  ADCS  determines  the  vehicle’s  attitude 
using  sensors  and  controls  it  using  actuators. ADCS  is  a major  spacecraft  system,  and 
its  requirements  often  drive  the  overall  S/C  design.  Components  are  cumbersome, 
massive  and  power  consuming.    Table  29  shows  a  summary  of  the  process  to  design 
ADCS system on a spacecraft. This table was inspired from Larson (1999).

(shown  in  gray).  Especially  the  output  of  step  4  determines  the  hardware  and 
corresponding masses that should be taken onboard the spacecraft.

Figure 89: Attitude control modes, from Larson (1999) 

 
Figure  89  shows  typical  attitude  control  mode  in  which  spacecraft  have  to  be  in.  The 
method  to  control  these  different  modes  depends  on  1/  the  mode  and  2/  the  type  and 
amount of disturbance. 
 
Disturbance  torques  can  be  cyclic  (which  average  to  zero  over  an  orbit)  or  secular 
(which  do  not  average  to  zero  over  an  orbit).    These  disturbances  can  be  controlled 
passively, i.e. without moving parts (by taking advantage of vehicle’s inertia or favorable 
disturbances),  or  actively.  For  active  control,  the  S/C  senses  the  attitude  motion  and 
applies control torques to counter it.

Analytical solutions  to  the equations of motion provide estimates  for preliminary mission 
and  vehicle  design  for  atmospheric  entry.    The  peak  aerodynamic  loads  and  heat  rate 
can  be  used  to  estimate  crew’s  acceleration  exposure  and  the  required  thermal 
protection  system.    For  example,  consider  the  equations  of motion  for  ballistic  re-entry.  
The peak aerodynamic load (Gmax), ge’s, at v is 0.607(ve) is:

density scale height  (km).   This quantity can be determined  from a  table of atmospheric 
density  (ρ)  and  altitude  (H)  by  forming  an  exponential  fit  between  the  altitudes  of 
interest: Hs = -(H2 – H1) / ln (ρ2/ ρ1). 

9.2.2.7.2. Heating 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      223              

 

The keystone to a conventional EDL system is its heat shield.  The heat shield is usually 
built from a structure of aluminum honeycomb and CFRP skins covered with an ablative 
material  that  absorbs  the  heat  of  the  entry  and  keeps  the  payload  at  an  appropriate 
temperature.  The ablator most used on the Shuttle External Tank, Mars Pathfinder, and 
the  Mars  Exploration  Rovers  programs  was  SLA561V  (Allouis,  2003).    This  material, 
based on a mixture of cork wood, binder and tiny silica glass spheres, has a density, ρm, 
of 264 kg/m3 and an effective heat of ablation, Qm, of 5.41 × 107 J/kg. 
 
The maximum  heating  rate  for  an  entry  profile  is evaluated at  the  stagnation  point  from 
a Sutton-Grave correlation:

density,  and  k  is  2.84  ×  10-5.    From  Equation  2,  it  is  apparent  that  the  bigger  the  nose 
radius, the lower the heat rates.  The maximum heat rate for a lifting body is given by:

where β  is  the ballistic coefficient  (m  / CDS), kg/m2, where m  is  the mass of  the vehicle, 
CD  is  the  hypersonic  drag  coefficient,  and  (L  /  D)  is  the  hypersonic  lift-to-drag  ratio.  
Notice that higher ballistic coefficient values result  in higher heat and deceleration loads. 
 
The  total  heat  load,  Q,  of  the  mission  is  derived  from  the  integration  of  the  heat  rates

thick  enough  to  keep  the  back  face  of  the  heat  shield  below  a  threshold  temperature 
even  after  the  ablation  process  that  takes  place  during  entry.   The  radiative  equilibrium 
temperature  is  given  by  qs  =  εσ(Ts)4  where  ε  is  the  black-body  emissivity  and  σ  is  the 
Stefan-Boltzmann  constant  (5.67  ×  10-8  W/m2K4).    The  minimum  thickness  of  ablator 
can be estimated from the heat transfer formula at constant wall temperature:

9.2.2.7.3. Accuracy 
The  Earth’s  thick  atmosphere  allows  a  spacecraft  to  perform  an  un-powered  descent 
and  landing  after  an  aerodynamically  controlled  entry.    The  design  of  parachute  and 
parafoil  systems  is  typically  an  iterative  process.    Still,  we  can  use  the  main  design 
driver – the terminal velocity of the probe – to determine some estimates.  Assuming the 
parachute  has  a  circular  cross-section,  the  parachute’s  diameter  for  a  given  Lander 
mass (mL) can be calculated from: 
 
 

Drag = ρ v2 / 2 × CD × A = mLg  

 
where  ρ  is  the  atmospheric  density  at  parachute  release,  v  is  the  desired  terminal 
velocity, CD  is  the drag  coefficient  (parachute and  vehicle), mL  is  the mass of Lander at 
engine  ignition,  g  is  the  planet’s  acceleration  due  to  gravity.    Both  the  Apollo  and 
Russian Soyuz capsules used parachutes to get terminal velocities of about 9 m/s and 7 
m/s, respectively.   
 
The  X-38  lifting  body  used  a  steerable  parafoil  that  slowed  vertical  landing  speeds 
(about 5 m/s),  increased cross-range capability, and allowed  for a gliding  touchdown on 
land.   Parafoils allow  for  improved hypersonic  range and cross-range capability, as well 
as  decreased  entry  acceleration  and  thermal  loads without  the  complexity  of  horizontal 
landings.   An Apollo-class vehicle,  like  the Modern Command Module  (MCM), designed 
with this technology would no longer require a water landing and recovery.  Furthermore, 
by using a  flare of  the parafoil system, we can  reduce  touchdown  loads without  the use 
of  decelerating  retrorockets.    The  following  equation  estimates  a  vehicle’s  straight-line 
range  while  on  a  parafoil,  assuming  the  flight  path  has  a  small  radial  acceleration  and 
rate of change:

As suggested by the equations of motion, a spacecraft must be aerodynamic to perform 
EDL.    The  external  shape  is  critical  for  interactions  with  the  significant  atmospheres  of 
Earth  and  Mars.    The  lift-to-drag  ratio  (L/D)  is  a  convenient  way  to  express  a  vehicle’s 
ability  to  maneuver  in  the  atmosphere.    In  addition,  the  vehicle’s  mass  distribution  and 
location of the vehicle’s center-of-mass is fundamental to its controllability.

9.4 Mars Initial Mass in LEO Calculations 
In order to compare different architectures and different trajectories, to select a baseline 
mission  design,  estimates  of  the  initial mass  in  LEO were  presented.    In  this  section,  a 
verification  of  the  payload  masses  is  given,  followed  by  the  relevant  equations  and  a 
detailed calculation.  All assumptions are restated for convenient reference.   

9.4.1 Verification of initial mass in LEO estimates 
A manned mission  to Mars will  require  a  significant mass  to  be  launched  from  Earth  in 
order  to  provide  the  required  delta  V  (∆V)  capacity  and  life  support  necessary  for  the 
transit  and  surface  stay.    The  mass  estimates  derived  in  this  report  are  compared  to 
those a paper by Walberg (1993).    
 
Walberg’s paper  reviews  four mission classes  (opposition, conjunction, conjunction with 
a  fast  transfer,  and  split-sprint  mission)  with  three  different  scenarios  (all  propulsive, 
aerobraking,  and  nuclear  propulsion)  and  gives  IMLEO  estimates  for  each.    After 
describing  each  mission  class  and  scenario,  I  will  compare  the  mass  estimates  for 
validation against the reference values for each mission scenario. 

9.4.1.2 Description of Mission Classes 
The  following  is  a  short  description  of  each  mission  class,  as  presented  in  Walberg 
(1993).   

9.4.1.2.1 Short-Stay Opposition 
The  first mission  type  investigated  is  an  opposition  class mission,  with  a  Venus  swing-
by,  as  displayed  in  Figure  91.   An  opposition  class mission  is  one where  the  alignment 
for  one  leg  of  the  transfer  is  not  optimal,  but  allows  for  relatively  short  planetary  stays, 
between 30 and 60 days.   Performing a swing-by at Venus allows  for a major  reduction 
in  the  required  ∆V  for  a  relatively  small  increase  in  time  of  flight.     Comparing  the  ∆V’s 
given  for  missions  not  employing  a  Venus  swing-by  Larson  (1999),  to  those  using  a 
swing-by  Walberg  (1993),  and  assuming  that  a  direct  entry  is  performed  at  Earth  for 
each, the average ∆V savings  is on the order of 8.3 km/s, reducing the average mission 
∆V  from  between  16-23  km/s  to  between  8-12  km/s.    The  total  increase  in  flight  time 
required to perform a Venus swing-by is between 50 to 100 days (depending on a given 
year).   Other  considerations,  such  as  a  close  pass  the  sun must  be  taken  into  account 
when  selecting  a  mission  design,  but  for  the  purposes  of  analyzing  initial  mass,  these 
considerations are neglected.

Figure 91:  Diagram of opposition class mission with a Venus fly-by (NASA DRM website) 

9.4.1.2.2 Long-Stay Conjunction 
The second type of mission is a conjunction class mission where a trade in surface time 
on Mars  is made  in  favor of a more optimum  flight  trajectory, as displayed  in Figure 92.  
Thus,  this  class  of  mission  requires  stays  on  Mars  on  the  order  of  300  to  500  days.  
However  the  ∆V  required  is  significantly  reduced  (between  5.2  km/s  and  6.9  km/s), 
assuming a direct Earth entry.  In addition, the decrease of ∆V required to enter both an 
Earth orbit and a Mars orbit are reduced which better facilitates aerobraking.

9.4.1.2.3 Fast-Transfer Conjunction 
The  third  type  of  mission  is  a  fast-transfer  conjunction-class  mission,  as  displayed  in 
Figure  93.    This  type  of  mission  increases  the  required  ∆V  to  between  8  and  10  km/s, 
assuming direct entry at Earth, but decreases the transit times to recorded zero-g levels 
(between 100  to 200 days per direction).   The  stay  times at Mars are  increased  slightly 
(approximately 50 days).      
 

 
Figure 93:  Diagram of fast-transfer conjunction class mission (NASA DRM website) 

9.4.1.2.4 Split-Sprint Mission 
The  fourth  type of mission  is a split-sprint mission.   The basic  idea  is  to pre-position  the 
cargo,  including  return  supplies  and  return  propellant  using  a  fuel-efficient  conjunction 
class  mission.    The  crew  is  then  transported  via  an  opposition-class  (outbound)  and 
fast-transfer  (inbound)  mission,  such  that  the  overall  mission  duration  is  reduced  to 
around  440  days,  with  a  30-day  surface  stay.    Although  the  ∆V’s  are  on  the  order 
presented above  for opposition-class and  fast-transfer missions,  the amount of payload 
on such a mission is significantly reduced.

9.4.1.3 Description of Scenarios 
Having  overviewed  the  four  missions  classes  described  above,  Walberg  detailed  the 
required  IMLEO  for  each  mission  using  three  scenarios.    The  first  scenario  is  an  all-
propulsive  maneuver  including  propulsive  orbit  insertion  at  both  Earth  and  Mars.    The 
second  scenario  uses  aerobraking  at  both  Earth  and  Mars  to  reduce  propellant 
requirements.    The  third  is  the  use  of  nuclear  propulsion.    For  chemical  propulsion,  the 
specific  impulse  is  480  sec,  and  a  structure  to  propellant  ratio  of  0.1  is  assumed.    For 
aerobraking,  the  structure  mass  is  assumed  to  be  15%  of  the  payload  mass.    For 
nuclear propulsion, a specific  impulse of 960 sec.  is assumed.   In addition, a 5% gravity 
loss is assumed for all propulsive maneuvers.   

9.4.1.3.1 Mass Payload Estimates 
The  general  trajectory  as  outlined  by  Walberg  includes  five  maneuvers:    a  trans-Mars 
injection  from  a  500  km  circular  Earth  orbit,  a mid-course  correction,  insertion  into  a  1-
sol Mars orbit, a trans-Earth injection, and an insertion into a 500 km circular Earth orbit.  
Thus the mission architecture  is similar to that of Apollo, using a Mars orbit rendezvous.  
All propulsive maneuvers  to  the surface of Mars and return  to Mars orbit are  included  in 
the  payload  mass  for  the  Lander.    Walberg  lists  payload  masses  for  the  habitation 
module,  landing  module,  and  Earth  return  capsule.    The  habitation  module  is  the  crew 
living quarters during transit to and from Mars.  The  landing module  includes crew  living 
quarters  for  the surface stay as well as  the propulsion  for  these maneuvers.   The Earth 
return  capsule  is  similar  to  that  of  an  Apollo  style  mission  and  houses  the  crew  during 
Earth orbit insertion and return to Earth.   
 
The  payload  masses  defined  by  Walberg  are  taken  from  Freeman  et  al.  (Freeman, 
1990) and are assumed to be in agreement with the NASA 90-Day study (NASA, 1989).  
However, the assumption of crew size is not stated in either Walberg (1993) or Freeman 
(1990),  and  although,  the  NASA  90-Day  study  assumes  a  crew  of  four  for  a  Mars 
mission, it does not outline any solid numbers for payload masses.  In addition, Walberg 
lists  two  different  masses  for  the  habitation  module.    A  larger  mass  is  given  for 
opposition and conjunction class missions, due to the increased transit times.  However, 
there  is  no  difference  in  the  Lander  mass  despite  different  surface  stay  times  and  no 
verification of the reduced mass estimates is provided. 
 
The  payload  masses  used  in  this  paper  are  derived  from  a  number  of  sources,  but 
loosely  reference equations and estimates provided  in Larson  (1999).   These estimates 
assume  a  crew  of  6,  do  not  account  for mission  duration  and  assume  a  surface  habitat 
is  provided  for  all  missions,  such  that  the  Lander  mass  is  independent  of  surface  stay 
requirements.    Table  39: Comparison  of  opposition  class mass  estimates with Walberg 
through Table 41 list the payload masses for each mission class defined by Walberg, for 
presumably  a  crew  of  4,  and  the  current  mass  estimates  used  for  a  crew  of  6.    The 
Lander  wet  masses  for  the  current  estimates  were  calculated  by  applying  the  rocket 
equation,  using  ∆V’s  obtained  from  Larson  (1999),  and  the  vehicle  assumptions  stated 
above.

9.4.1.3.2 Comparison of Initial Mass in LEO Estimates 
Using  the  payload  masses  listed  in  Table  39  through  Table  41,  and  ∆V’s  listed  in 
Walberg,  his  results  are  verified  with  the  rocket  equation  calculations  used.    Under  the 
same mission  assumptions  as  those  provided  in Walberg,  we  can  compute  the  IMLEO 
for the current estimates and these results are listed in Table 42. 
 
If we compare the IMLEO for each mission scenario, we notice a few trends.  The mass 
estimates  are  higher  than Walberg,  but  these  estimates  take  into  account  a  crew  of  6, 
which  would  seem  to  validate  the  results.    If  we  compare  each  mission  scenario  with 
and without aerobraking, it becomes obvious that aerobraking yields a significant benefit 
for each mission.  Nuclear propulsion yields a significant mass savings for each mission 
class,  which  would  indicate  that  this  is  an  area  of  technology  that  may  be  worth 
developing.

9.4.1.4 Conclusion 
The  payload  estimates  provided  by  Walberg  can  be  reproduced  using  the  rocket 
equation  calculations  defined,  which  validates  the  model  used  in  this  paper.    The 
current  mass  estimates  seem  to  provide  a  reasonable  approximation  of  the  IMLEO 
estimates  since  they  are  only  slightly  higher  than  those  provided  by  Walberg,  but  are 
meant to accommodate a crew of 6 instead of a crew of 4.   
 
Having analyzed the different IMLEO estimates for comparison with each other and with 
the  different  mass  scenarios,  it  has  become  obvious  that  aerobraking  is  required  to 
achieve  reasonable  IMLEO  estimates  for  chemical  propulsion.    In  addition,  nuclear 
propulsion  has  been  shown  to  yield  an  additional  benefit,  and  may  warrant  further 
development.  

9.4.2 Example Calculation of Initial mass in LEO 
The  initial  estimates  of  the  mass  in  LEO  derived  by  applying  the  rocket  equation  in 
succession to the payload masses.  The rocket equation for n stages is simply

where  αi  is  the  structure  factor.    By  applying  this  formula  from  the  final  payload  mass 
delivered  back  to  Earth, we  can  determine  the  initial mass  in  LEO  for  a  chemical  burn.  
If  aerobraking  is  employed,  the  formula  for  calculating  the  initial  mass  for  that  stage  is

required,  and  the  specific  impulse  is  assumed  to  be  425  sec.    In  this  example,  we 
assume  that  the  return  propulsion,  Landers  with  fuel,  and  habitation  module  is  pre-
positioned.  The total mass in LEO is the sum of all the components.

9.5 Knowledge Transport Calculations and Architecture 

9.5.1 Architecture 
The knowledge delivery  infrastructure will consist of  two parts  the delivery of data  in  the 
form  of  bits  and  the  delivery  of  samples  from  the  planets  surface.    This  section  will 
largely  deal  with  the  delivery  knowledge  in  the  form  of  bits  and  thus  will  in  this  section 
be referred to as communication delivery system. 
 
For  every  mission  size  the  same  communication  radio  frequency  has  been  selected  in 
order  to  provide  an  easily  extensible  system.    The  radio  frequency  that  each  of  these 
missions  will  use  is  Ka-Band  or  32  gigahertz.    This  frequency  was  selected  because  it 
can  support  a  high  data  rate  with  comparably  lower  power  than  all  lower  frequency 
bands,  and  because  the  DSN  ground  infrastructure  will  support  it  by  the  year  2007, 
while  other  higher  frequency  bands  are  not  supported  by  the  DSN.    There  is  some 
concern about weather interference especially when communicating with Mars, however 
a  Martian  sand  storm  would  prevent  a  X-band  communication  as  it  would  a  Ka-band 
communication,  the  differences  would  mainly  lie  in  the  moderate  weather  such  as  a 
cloudy  day,  or  light  dust  storm  in  which  case  the  Ka-bands  data  rate  would  be 
decreased. 
 
For the small sized  lunar missions a direct  link can be set up between  the Moon Lander 
and  one  of  the  Earth’s  DSN  stations.    This  would  allow  constant  communication 
between Earth  and  the Moon  throughout  the  entire mission.    The  data  rate  required  for 
this mission would be 1 gigabit/day would  require 0.01 Watts of power per  transmission 
with  a  transmission  data  rate  of  0.07 megabits/sec.   After  the mission  is  completed  the 
communication  equipment  that  was  landed  on  the  Moon  will  be  left  there  for  two 
reasons, one  if a  future mission decides  to use  that spot as a  landing or settlement site 
then  they won’t have  to bring  their own equipment and  in  the unlikely case  that another 
future mission  communication  equipment  fails  the  crew will  have  the  option  of  traveling 
in a rover to the old site and using its equipment. 
 
For  the  medium  sized  missions  the  infrastructure  is  essentially  the  same  as  the  small 
mission except that it will require a higher daily data rate and transmitting power. 
Daily data rate:  10 gigabits/day 
Transmission data rate:  0.7 megabits/sec 
Power required:  0.1 Watts 
 
For  the Large sized missions  require  the ability  to communicate between  the  far side of 
the  planet  and  Earth.   The  astronauts  will  communicate  through  one  of  four  possible 
ways.  For the first option an comm. relay satellite could be placed at the L4 point  in the 
Earth Moon system, this is good because it allows for a constant communication stream 
between  the  Earth  and  the  Moon,  unfortunately  this  option  would  only  allow  for 
communication for the first 900km onto the Moon’s far side.  The next option is to set up 
a  relay  satellite  in  a  Low  Lunar  orbit  that  has  the  advantage  of  covering  most  of  the 
Moon,  but 
the  disadvantage  of  a 
large 
time  delay  between 
far  side

      236              

 

communications.  The third option is probably the best and involves setting up a satellite 
in orbit around  the Earth-Moon L2  (EM-L2) point  thus covering  the  far side of  the Moon 
in  it's entirety and can keep  in almost constant communication with Earth,  the drawback 
to  this  architecture  is  that  though  orbiting  the  L2  point  is  technically  and  theoretically 
feasible it is untried and less stable than placing the satellite at a Lagrangian point.  The 
last  option  is  more  for  emergencies  sake  than  anything  else,  it  is  possible  for  the  dark 
side  of  the  Moon  to  use  an  orbiter  around  Mars  or  a  Martian  settlement  as  a  relay  to 
Earth,  the main  problem with  this  is  that  it would  require  a  large  amount  of  power  for  a 
very small data rate, and would only be feasible at certain windows when Mars is visible 
to  the  far  side  of  the Moon.    The  daily  data  rate  for  a  large  sized mission  would  be  50 
gigabits/day, 
the 
transmission  data  rate  would  be  3.5  megabits/sec  and 
the 
transmission power required would be 0.5 W. 
 
All  of  these  missions  will  have  the  capacity  in  some  manner  to  point  their  antennas  at 
Mars  and  send  or  receive  communications  from  or  to  future Mars missions  at  low  data 
rate. 

 
For  the  Mars  missions  only  a  small  a  large  size  mission  will  be  considered.    For  the 
small sized Mars missions a direct link can be set up between the Mars Lander and one 
the  Earth’s  DSN  stations.    This  would  allow  semi-frequent  communication  between 
Earth  and  Mars  throughout  the  entire  mission.    The  data  rate  required  for  this  mission 
would  be  1  gigabits/day  and  would  require  8  Watts  of  power  per  transmission  with  a 
transmission  data  rate  of  .035  megabits/sec.    After  the  mission  is  completed  the 
communication  equipment  that  was  landed  on  Mars  will  be  left  there  for  two  reasons, 
one  if a future mission decides to use that spot as a  landing or settlement site then they 
won’t  have  to  bring  their  own  equipment  and  in  the  unlikely  case  that  another  future 
mission  communication  equipment  fails  the  crew  will  have  the  option  of  traveling  in  a 
rover to the old site and using its equipment. 
 
The  Large  sized  missions  require  the  ability  to  communicate  with  much  greater  data 
rate  and  thus  it  might  be  necessary  to  create  a  relay  satellite  around  Mars.   There  are 
two  realistic  options  for  the  location  of  this  sat.   The  satellite  could  be  placed  in  a 
Geostationary Martian orbit around  the  landing site,  the advantage of a GMO satellite  is 
that  it  increases  the  time  that  the  astronauts  can  communicate  with  the  Earth,  the 
disadvantage  is  that  it can only  really be set up  for one portion of  the planet.   The other 
option  is  to  position  a  satellite  at  the  Earth-Mars  L1  point  thus  decreasing  the  power 
required to send  large communication streams to the Earth, unfortunately this would not 
add  any  extra  time  that  the  mission  could  communicate  with  the  ground.    As  with  the 
Moon missions  there  is  an  option  in  the  case  of  emergencies  to  communicate  with  the 
Moon  and  use  it  as  a  relay  station.   The  daily  data  rate  for  a  large  sized mission would 
be  10  gigabits/day,  the  transmission  data  rate  would  be  0.35  megabits/sec  and  the 
transmission power required would be 8 W.

Where  D  is  the  diameter  of  the  antenna,  λ  is  the  wavelength,  and  η  is  the

9.5.3 Optical Communication Trades  
The  case  for  the  use  of  optical  communication  in  an  extensible  exploration  program  is 
not  as  strong  as  the  current  knowledge  of  Ka-band  or  X-band  communication.   Optical 
communication  has  several  advantages  over  the  more  common  radio  communication 
channels,  these  being  a  much  higher  data  rate  for  the  same  amount  of  mass,  power 
and volume, all very important in the design of a space mission.  Unfortunately there are 
also  several  devastating  drawbacks  to  optical  communication,  in  particular  the  serious 
losses  due  to  atmospheric  interferences  and  its  high  pointing  requirements,  making  it 
next to impossible to use optical communication over any distance greater than from the 
Earth to the Moon.  These drawbacks while serious can be overcome  in some cases by 
the aforementioned advantages, however, in an extensible exploration program such as 
this  one  that  is  being  proposed,  it  is  far  more  important  to  have  a  common 
communication  system  for  the  entire  program,  thus  when  the  need  arises  to  extend  to 
the next exploration site there is already a communication network in place to help relay 
transmissions.    This  is  not  to  say  that  optical  communication  should  not  be  used  in  all 
space  missions,  on  the  contrary  there  are  many  situations  where  the  use  of  optical 
communication  would  benefit  the mission  substantially,  however  in  this  case  it  is  wiser 
to use a more established form of radio communication. 

9.5.4 Mars Science Details (Knowledge) 
One  of  the main  interests  of Mars  is  the  search  for water.    Possible  locations  for water 
are the polar caps, subsurface ice, gullies, stream lined islands, rampart craters, outflow 
channels,  and  layered  terrain  (PSSS  2003).    There  are  two  scientific  methods  of 
determining water  on Mars,  geologically  or  by  studying  the  climate  and  their  objectives 
and approach are summarized below.

Figure 95 Mars Science Objectives (PSSS, 2003) 

 
Some of main questions in Mars geology include understanding planetary origin and 
evolution by determining the core and mantle size and composition and mapping the 
current and past tectonic activity (PSSS 2003).  Additional knowledge questions can 
also be found using Mars Field Geology, Biology, and Paleontology Workshop (Harvey 
1998).   

9.5.5 Additional Knowledge Materials (background) 
A  great  deal  of  research  has  been  done  on  the  instruments  needed  to  gather  scientific 
and  resource  related  knowledge  on  the Moon  and Mars.   An  important  first  step  before 
sending  robotic explorers  is  to understand what current  information exists.   An example 
of a database of Moon and Mars constituents and their locations can be seen in Table 1.  
Future  robotic  missions  can  add  to  the  resolution  of  location  and  occurrence  until  it  is 
necessary to send a human mission.

A method of determining science and resource related knowledge is through the use of 
a geophysical network.  There are several methods of achieving this, outlined by the 
Lunar Exploration Science Working Group and the 2003 JPL Planetary Science 
Summer School (LExSWG 1995, PSSS 2003).  Both studies included using penetrators 
and soft Landers.  A summary of different deployment methods and their advantages 
and disadvantages are seen in Table 45.  A challenge of creating geophysical nets is 
aligning the instrument and achieving a large global access for a long duration.  Current 
planning tends to focus on penetrators and soft landings, which can be accomplished by 
robotic missions such as the Mars Net Landers.  However human missions have two 
advantages over robotic geology missions.  They are the experience knowledge gained 
by a human mission and a more optimal aligning and positioning of geologic 
instruments.  The goals of the space transportation system are to eliminate the current 
disadvantages listed such as the high expense and global access.

Past  research on  the  capabilities  needed  to  varying  amount  of  knowledge  returned  can 
also  be  seen  in  “Geoscience”  (1988).    Outlined  in  Table  46  are  three  levels  of 
knowledge,  correlating  with  small,  medium,  and  large,  for  a  Moon  mission  and  their 
respective  instruments  with  focus  on  geology.    Future  Moon  and  Mars  architectures 
should  also  have  detailed  instrumentation  and  the  information  gathered  levels  for 
climatology and resource related knowledge.

9.6 Lunar Landing Sites 
For  this design study we do not need a  thorough understanding of  the geologic value of 
the  Moon  (or  Mars),  but  we  do  need  to  know  what  landing  sites  will  be  sought  by  the 
scientists, so that we can design our missions accordingly.  Unlike early Apollo missions 
(Figure  96),  we  should  not  be  so  constrained 
to 
the  equator. 
  Based 
in 
recommendations  from  some  planetary  geologists  as  well  as  landing  site  selection 
papers, we  recommend  the capability  for orbits  to at  least +/- 30°  latitude, and maintain 
the  capability  to  land  on  the  far  side.    This  should  satisfy  most  of  the  suggestions  for 
landing sites. 
 
 
The  following  is  an  elementary  and  somewhat  oversimplified  summary  of  some  of  the 
scientific motivations for going to the Moon, and associated landing sites.   
Figure  97  and  Figure  98  show  the  sites  (sites  [A]  through  [G],  plus  Apollo  11  site  in 
Figure 96), and images of each site are also shown in the figures section.   
 
Volcanism.   When  did  volcanism  end  on  the  Moon?    The  Lichtenberg  Basalts  (68°W, 
32°N,  [A],  suggested by Robinson, personal communication) are potentially  the Moon’s 
youngest  basalts;  they  may  be  between  1  and  2.5  billion  years  old.    This  area  would 
give  us  a  view  of  what  basalts  looked  like  from  the  beginning  of  the Moon’s  volcanism 
(~3 billion years) to the formation of this area.   
 
Lunar  volatiles.    Aristarchus  Plateau  (48°W,  24°N,  [B],  suggested  by  Robinson  and 
Taylor,  personal  communications)  is  a  complex  pyroclastic  center  with  a  rich  volcanic 
history.   Samples  are  likely  to  be  a  diverse  suite  of  the magma  source,  and  it would  be 
possible  to  determine  spectral  reflectance/composition  from  this  previously  unsampled 
material.    Alphonsus  (3°W,  13°S,  [C])  and    Sulpicius  Gallus  (20°N,  12°E,  [D],  both 
suggested by Robinson, personal communication) are two other regions with pyroclastic 
materials  that  would  hint  at  the  history  of  lunar  volatiles  (which  are  necessary  for 
volcanic  explosions).   The South Pole Aitken Basin  (crater  is  172°E,  18°S,  [E], massifs 
155°E,  25°S)  is  also  a  good  place  to  study  lunar  volatiles  (including  water),  as 
mentioned in The Poles section below. 
 
KREEP  basalts.    Apollos  12,  14,  and  15  found  a  strange  basaltic  material  they 
nicknamed  KREEP  (potassium,  Rare  Earth  Elements,  and  Phosphorus).    Rare  earth 
elements are extracted from liquid magma when other elements in the magma thermally 
differentiate  and  cool  into  a  crystalline  structure;  the  rare  earth  elements  do  not  fit  into 
this  crystalline  structure,  so  they  form  abnormally  high  concentrations,  nicknamed 
KREEP.    This  finding  introduced  the  concept  that  lunar  maria  did  not  form 
simultaneously, but over hundreds of millions of years.  The Apennine Bench Formation 
(mountain  range  centered  at  0°,  20°,  [F],  Robinson,  personal  communication)  would 
allow  us  to  sample  this  mysterious  material  and  learn  more  about  the  thermal 
differentiation  of  the  ancient  magma  and  maria  formation.    Aristarchus  Crater  (48°W, 
24°N,  [B],  Taylor  and  Schmitt,  personal  communications)  is  also  likely  to  contain  high 

Final Report- 16.89 Space System Design, Spring 2004 

      243              

 

concentrations  of  KREEP,  and  would  also  allow  us  study  of  cratering  processes  and 
crustal stratigraphy. 
 
The  poles.    The  South  Pole  Aitken  Basin  [E]  (suggested  by  Robinson,  Taylor,  and 
Schmitt,  personal  communications,  and  Spudis  2000)  is  one  of  the  most  sought  after 
landing  sites.    Its  temperature  variations  are  considerably  less  than  elsewhere  on  the 
planet,  and  the  -230°  C  temperatures  in  the  shadowed  regions  may  contain  4  billion 
year old volatiles (water – Harland, 1999).  It is the oldest impact basin on the Moon, but 
the exact age  is unknown.    If we  land near  the massifs, we could  “sample  impact melts 
and do geophysical measurements to study the structure of basin massifs to understand 
how  they  formed”  (Taylor,  personal  communication  -  a  massif  is  basically  a  mountain 
range;  faults  and  folds  in  the Moon’s  crust).    The  composition  of  the  South  Pole  Aitken 
Basin  is currently not known, but  it  is known  that  interior of  the basin has not been  later 
filled or covered by foreign material (Pieters et al., 2003). 
 
Stratigraphy.  As  mentioned  above,  Aristarchus  Crater  [B]  and  the  South  Pole  Aitken 
Basin [E] are useful for studying crustal processes.  The crater Tsiolkosky (129°E, 21°S, 
[G],  suggested  by  Taylor  and  Schmitt,  personal  communications)  has  a  central  peak, 
which  may  be  a  part  of  the  original  lunar  crust.    It  may  be  a  “great  place  to  study  the 
nature  of  cumulate  anorthosites”  (Taylor,  personal  communication;  anorthosites  among 
the most ancient rocks on the Moon) as well as crustal stratigraphy. 
  
Seismology.    The  nature  of  the  lunar  interior  is  still  somewhat  ambiguous.   Neal  et  al. 
(2003)  suggest  a  lunar  seismic  network  (see  Figure  99),  including  a  minimum  of  8 
seismometers deployed around  the Moon.   These could be deployed with unmanned or 
manned  missions,  but  could  certainly  involve  international  cooperation.    Seismometers 
would allow testing of the hypothesis that the Moon was formed from a magma ocean in 
its early stages. 
 
Other  questions  (Ryder  et  al.,  1989).   The origin of  the Moon may be better studied  if 
early  thermal  differentiation  were  better  understood  (see  KREEP  discussion  above).  
Lunar mare  basalts  should  be  better  studied  to  understand  not  only  the  thermal  history 
of  the  Moon,  but  also  the  depth  of  the  ancient  magma  oceans,  and  their  detailed 
compositions.    Lunar  stratigraphy  may  help  us  to  understand  the  impact  history  of  the 
Moon – when were the greatest periods of bombardment? (This has  implications for the 
history of Earth, because if there was heavy bombardment on the Moon, there also was 
on Earth.)    Lunar  regolith  (loose  soil), which  sits  on  the  top  layer  of  the Moon,  contains 
the  history  of  billions  of  years  of  solar  wind  and  flares.    Finally,  usable  lunar  resources 
(such  as water  and Helium-3)  need  to  be  explored  for  future manufacturing  plausibility.  
Landing  sites  for  this  purpose  may  include  Mare  Tranquilitatis  (Apollo  11  site)  and 
Aristarchus [B] (both suggested by Schmitt, personal communication).
