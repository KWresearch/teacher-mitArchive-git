Atmospheric Drag

• Satellites traveling through the atmosphere 
encounter drag forces due to neutral particles
• Density and composition of 
particles varies with :
– altitude 
– geographic location
– solar radiation
– geomagnetic activity

Atmospheric
Composition

Prediction of drag effects on spacecraft traveling 
Prediction of drag effects on spacecraft traveling 
through the atmosphere is highly uncertain

May 13, 2002

16.89 Space Systems Design Review

11

Drag Modeling and Prediction

• During certain solar cycles 
or magnetic storms, 
atmospheric density can 
increase as much as 100% 
(shown in red at right)
• These disturbances cause 
thousands of objects to alter 
their predicted orbits.  
These objects must be 
“found” again by tracking 
stations

16.89 Space Systems Design Review

Mission Description

• The Air Force Research Lab’s Space Vehicles 
Branch needs data to develop satellite drag and 
neutral density models

• The models will enable:
– Precision orbit predictions for high interest satellites
– Re-entry prediction
– Positioning of AF surveillance satellites
– Collision avoidance
– Cataloging space debris orbits

What is an attribute?

• Quantifiable variable capable of 
measuring how well a user-defined
objective is met
• Set of attributes must be:
• Non-redundant
• Complete
• Operational
• Minimal
• Decomposable
• Independent of cost
• “Rule of 7” Human mind limited to 
roughly 7 simultaneous concepts

What is Utility?

• Mathematical measure of “goodness”—lifted 
from Economics
• Ranges from 0 – 1: Ordered Metric scale
• Involved in the interview process and “multi-
attribute utility theory”
• Allows us to expand the possibilities for 
design and trade one attribute against another

May 13, 2002

16.89 Space Systems Design Review

22

Multi-Attribute Interview Software 
Tool (MIST)

• Attributes framed by 
“scenarios”—meant to take 
each attribute in isolation
• MIST uses the “lottery 
equivalent probability” to 
create a utility curve
• User first rates each 
attribute individually, then 
balances each against the 
others

*MIST created by Satwik Seshasai

Stage 1: Calculate Attributes
1. Determine mission scenario and satellites 
used
2. Divide mission scenario into “phases”, 
where a new phase denotes a
change in attribute values.
3. Calculate the specific
attribute values from the 
satellites involved in each 
phase

• Overview
– A process allowing subsystems to trade design 
parameters in a formal setting
• Provides real-time feedback into the effect of those 
trades on:
– Other subsystems  
– The overall utility of the mission
– Facilitates detailed analysis of the tradespace
– Faster than traditional processes

MATE-CON

• Human interaction
– All engineers operate within the same 
environment both physically and technically 
• Human interaction key to process
• Design sessions "scripted" and controlled by one 
person
• Many eyes on final product
– Experts in each area design key trades which 
directly affect their subsystem
• Examine all major spacecraft subsystems
• "Father knows best"

Variation caused by the solar cycle

• Note that base case was solar max; Solar cycle state assumed 
constant throughout life
• Solar cycle has greatest impact on Green
– Green has lower orbit than Red or Magenta
• At solar min and mean, Magenta has higher utility than Red

Design Insights

• Utility plays a significant role
– Initial utilities show that S/C design does not 
matter
• Orbit is the largest driver
– Revised utilities show that S/C does matter
• ‘Flying Bomb’
– Large amounts of fuel can bring down uncertainty 
and increase robustness
• Can modify orbit dynamically
– Can possibly gain significant utility from re-entry

May 13, 2002

16.89 Space Systems Design Review

82

Design Insights (II)

• Atmospheric density has greatest uncertainty
– We are designing for an unknown environment
• Need flexibility
• Drag is an enormous driver
– MATE-CON reveals unintuitive finding

MATE-CON Insights (I)

• Communication is key!
– Iterate with user/customer 
– Establish contact with user/customer early in the 
process
– Facilitate communication within the team 
• Work in the same room!
• Ensure shared mental model of process, software 
architecture and information flow
• Manage coupling and interaction between subsystems

84

MATE-CON Insights (II)

• Availability of past projects facilitates learning, but 
can be dangerous if used without critical judgment
– Model reuse can be inefficient or even wrong when the 
underlying assumptions are different!
• Agility is essential when working under time pressure 
and in an evolving environment
– True for both people and process!
– Example: changes in utility curve
• The level of fidelity should be consistent across the 
different modules
– Not always the case that high fidelity is better

May 13, 2002

16.89 Space Systems Design Review

85

Future Opportunities/
Recommendations
• Assess effect of code reuse on process efficiency
• Increase team-team and team-customer 
communication in early stages of process
• Improve execution sequencing in ICE
• Facilitate detection of “bugs” in subsystem 
interactions
• Account for uncertainty
– Launch opportunity & policy
• Include improved risk assessment
– Recent work in Portfolio theory

Payload
• All constant values as given 
in AFRL presentation. Based 
on using their instruments
Structures
• Assumes standard mass and 
power ratios for primary and 
secondary structures, cabling 
and mechanisms
Thermal
• Assumes standard mass and 
power ratios for thermal 
subsystem
May 13, 2002

Spacecraft Module

Power
• Total power needed is 
calculated by summing 
power requirements of all 
other systems. 
• Two options : Fuel Cells or 
Solar Arrays

Propulsion
• This module only sizes the 
propulsion hardware
• Two options: Chemical (Isp
350) or Hall (Isp 1500)

Spacecraft Module

Spacecraft Module

• The Spacecraft Module runs all the sub-modules and uses 
their output to compile mass, fuel, volume, dimension and 
lifetime estimates for the spacecraft as well as software 
and TFU costs.
•Note: The power estimate was already calculated in the 
power module.
• The module outputs three lifetime estimates:  1) assuming 
fuel only used for station keeping, 2) assuming station 
keeping and de-orbit and 3) assuming orbital insertion 
(from a circular perigee orbit),  de-orbit and station keeping

• The spacecraft module estimates total amount of software 
needed, amount of storage space needed onboard, 
processing hardware needed and  
• The module outputs a data latency value which is the 
longest length of time possible between receiving data.
• TFU cost is estimated using SMAD model

Orbits
• Varying: apogee, perigee, 
inclination
• Outputs include:
– Orbital period
– Minimum and maximum 
latitude encountered
– Dynamic pressure 
coefficient
– Vector of altitudes with 
respect to time

Orbits & Spacecraft

Spacecraft
• The spacecraft will be 
delivered to it's final orbit 
by the launch vehicle
• Spacecraft is a 1:2

Cost Module

Description
• Includes spacecraft, 
operations, launch, and 
program level costs
•Uses CERs for 
spacecraft/program level
• Uses NASA’s Operations Cost 
Model
• Incorporates 95% learning 
curve
• Discounts costs at a 1.9% rate

Key Assumptions
•Assumes small satellites (20-
400 kg)
• Costs in FY2000, inflated to 
FY2002
•Assumes payment for S/C is 
made on year of launch (for 
discount)
• Annual operations cost is  
yearly constant for one S/C, 
another constant for 2 parallel 
S/C (before discounting)

Scenarios

Sample Altitude:

• Hypothesize a new ground station
• Ground station will significantly increase data life 
span as compared to current systems
• Uncertain long-term funding
– You have a 45% chance of getting 11 years (best) and
– 55% chance of getting .5 years (worst)
OR
– 50% chance of getting 2 years (best) and 
– 50% chance of getting 0.5 years (worst)
