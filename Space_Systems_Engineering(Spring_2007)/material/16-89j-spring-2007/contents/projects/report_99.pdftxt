Abstract 
A  fundamental  act ivity  during  the  conceptual  design  phase  for  a  large  project  is  the 
comparison of  compet ing  system  architectures.  The ASTRO  team  has  developed  a  process 
and  a  software  tool,  based  on  a  quantitative  systems  engineering  methodology,  to  conduct 
trade  studies  dur ing  the  conceptual  design  phase  of  the  Terrestrial  Planet  Finder  (TPF) 
mission, which  is scheduled  to  launch  in 2010.   The TPF mission analysis so ftware (TMAS) 
package  consists  of 6  macro-modules  that  model  the  physics  and  processes  that  distinguish 
between  compet ing  system  architectures,  including  structurally  connected  (truss)  and 
separated  spacecraft  (format ion  flying)  concepts.   Ultimately,  each  design  is  evaluated  by  a 
performance  assessment  module  (GINA),  which  computes  the  capability,  performance,  and 
cost  of  each  architecture.  The  cost  per  image  metric  is  the  primary  metric  used  to  trade 
architectures against each other.  This metric represents  the ratio of  the total lifecyc le cost of 
the  mission  divided  by  the  number  of  useful  “im ages”  r eturned,  where  “ images”  r epresent 
the total number of surveys and spectroscopic observat ions accomplished during  the mission 
lifet ime.    Limited  resources,  in  the  form  of  personnel  and  t ime,  determined  the  level  o f 
fidelity  incorporated  into  the  model.    The  team  focused  on  developing  models  for  the 
processes  with  the  greatest  likelihood  to  contribute  to  the  different iat ion  between 
architectures.    After  using  benchmark  spacecraft  configurat ions,  previously  developed  by 
industry  teams,  to  validate  the  TMAS  package,  the  team  conducted  one  dimensional  trade 
studies from a baseline spacecraft configuration to evaluate general trends. 

It is premature to propose a specific spacecraft architecture for the TPF mission based on the 
current  results  --  further  exploration  of  the  trade  space  is  required.    Furthermore,  a  crit ical 
review  of  the  assumpt ions  and  the modeling  approach  in  each  so ftware module  is  necessary 
to  validate  the  process  beyond  the  benchmark  cases.    Nevertheless,  the  TMAS  is  a 
comprehensive, modular,  expandable,  and  robust  tool  for  trading  TPF mission  architectures 
using unified and quant itative metrics.

1.0  Executive Summary 
As  part  of  a  series  of NASA’ s  Origins  missions  to  answer  fundamental  quest ions  regarding 
the  origin  o f  life,  the  Terrestrial  Planet  Finder  (TPF)  is  the  first  mission  that  will  direct ly 
detect  the  existence  o f  Earth-like  planets  in  our  stellar  neighborhood.    To  do  so,  TPF  will 
need  to  suppress  the  light  from  the  parent  star  by  a  factor of  one  million while  maintaining 
good  transmissivity  in  the  habitable  zone  between  0.5  and  3  AU.   The  existence  of  these 
planets  is  confirmed  through  the  detection  of  various  key  compounds  in  the  mid-infrared 
spectrum.  These key compounds will serve as "Markers for life" in this TPF mission. 

The  level  o f  star  light  suppression  required  can  be  achieved  through  the  use  of  a  Bracewell 
nulling  interferometer.  Such  an  instrument  is  very  s imilar  to  convent ional  interferometers 
except  for  the  introduction of  a 180o phase  shift  to  create  a required  null  at  the  center of  the 
interferometer ’ s  transmissivity.    In  either  case,  the  success  of  an  interferometer  depends  on 
the  ability  to  place  accurately  the  apertures  in  their  respect ive  locat ions.    The  precise 
placement  of  the  apertures  can  be  achieved  through  several  proposed  interferometer  types 
such  as  a  structurally  connected  interferometer  (SCI),  a  separated  spacecraft  interferometer 
(SSI),  a  tethered  interferometer,  a  hybrid  architecture,  and  a  celest ial  body  interferometer. 
The quest ion then,  is which of these  interferometers would be best for the TPF? 

To  best  answer  the  proposed  question,  the  ASTRO  team  developed  a  process,  based  on  a 
quant itative  systems  engineering  methodology,  to  conduct  trade  studies  during  the 
conceptual  design  phase  of  TPF.    However,  a  qualitative  analysis  was  performed  first  to 
determine  the  physics  and  compet ing  factors  that  would  dist inguish  the  different 
architectures.  The  analys is  led  to  the  development  of  the  six macro-modules,  which  model 
the  physics  and  processes  for  two  system  architectures,  namely  the  structurally  connected 
and  format ion  flying  concepts.  These  six  macro-modules  form  the  TPF  mission  analysis 
software  (TMAS)  package.   Ultimately,  each  design  architecture, which  is  dist inguished  by 
its  operating  orbit,  the  number  of  apertures,  the  size  of  its  apertures,  and  the  type  of 
interferometer,  is  evaluated  by  the  performance  assessment  module  (GINA),  which 
computes  the  capability,  integrity,  and  life  cycle  cost.    In  this  study,  the  cost  per  image 
metric  is  the  primary metric used  to  trade the different  architectures.  This metric  represents 
the  ratio  of  the  total  lifecycle  cost  of  the  mission  divided  by  the  number  of  useful  "images" 
returned,  where  "images"  represent  the  expected  number  of  surveys  and  spectroscopy 
observat ions accomplished during the mission lifetime. 

In  order  to  validate  the  TMAS  package,  several  benchmarking  cases  were  performed  and 
compared  against  configurat ions  previously  developed  by  industry  teams. 
In  these 
benchmarking  cases,  only  mass  figures  for  the  different  configurations  were  compared. 
Even  though  the  results  obtained  were  not  exactly  the  same,  comparisons  between  these 
configurations  indicated that the TMAS package  is accurate within an order of magnitude. 

The  level  o f  detail  was  chosen  based  on  the  limited  resources  of  this  class  project  and  the 
necessity  to  accurately  predict  relevant  differences  between  architectures.  Init ial  trade 
studies  were  conducted,  where  one  parameter  at  a  time  was  varied  from  a  nominal  design

case  invo lving 4 apertures in a  linear-symmetric array with 2m apertures. From the results of 
the  trades,  very  interesting  relationships  and  trends  were  observed.  As  an  example  it  was 
found  that  the optimal  cost  performance  relat ionship  seems  to  be  achieved  at  a  heliocentric 
alt itude  around  2.5  AU.  At  lower  alt itudes  the  local  zodiacal  dust  cloud  leads  to  increased 
integrat ion  times  for  a  given  SNR. At  higher  alt itudes,  the  launch  costs  exceed  the  benefits 
gained  from  the  reduced  local  no ise  environment.  Another  interesting  observat ion  was  that 
the number of  images generally  increases as more  apertures  are  added  to  the  architecture.  In 
the SSI case, however,  an  exceedingly  large  number of  apertures  (> 10)  reduces  the number 
of  images produced due to  the  larger mission  inefficiency  of  a  complex  separated  spacecraft 
architecture. 

To  formally  conclude  the  trade  studies,  two  more  case  studies  were  performed.    The 
different  one- dimensional  parameters  that  led  to  a  local  minima  for  cost  per  image  were 
combined  for  both  the  SSI  and  SCI.  The  resultant  architectures  gave  the  lowest  cost  per 
image  metric  among  all  the  cases  that  have  been  performed.    Unfortunately,  these 
architectures  were  found  to  be  more  massive  and  expansive.    Their  lower  cost  per  image 
metric was due primarily to the higher number of expected images attainable. 

It  is premature to propose a particular architecture for TPF based on the current results  since 
further  exploration  of  the  trade  space  should  be  conducted  first.    Furthermore,  a  crit ical 
review of  the  assumpt ions  and  the modeling  approach  in  each  so ftware module  is  necessary 
to validate the process beyond  the benchmark cases.  Nevertheless,  this  study has  succeeded 
in producing a useful and robust  tool for  trading TPF mission architectures based on unified 
and quant itative metrics. 

The team learned a number of lessons throughout the course.  In the trade analys is phase,  the 
team  learned  a  great  deal  about  the  systems  engineering  process  ranging  from  init ial 
definit ion  o f  the  system  design  space  to  down-select ing  the  best  potential  options.    In  the 
preliminary  design  phase,  balancing  between  the  complexity  o f  the  analys is  model  and  the 
limited time available became  in an  important issue.  Finally,  in  the crit ical design phase,  the 
proper  maintenance  of  an  Interface  Control  Document  enabled  the  integration  of  the 
different  modules  into  one  funct ional  so ftware  package.  In  general,  team  members  gained 
the  experience  of  participating  in  an  integrated  design  team,  including  design  and 
programming  tasks,  sharing  responsibilit ies  for  making  presentations,  and  creating 
engineering documentation.

2.0  Project Overview 
The  object ives  of  the  TPF  mission  architecture  analys is  are  ident ified  in  the  fo llowing 
ASTRO mission statement: 

“To  conduct  a   trade  study  of  mission  architectures  for  NASA’ s  Terrestrial  Planet  Finder 
mission  using  a  quantitative  systems  engineering methodology.  One  fundamental  objective 
will  be  to  develop  a  methodology  for  the  comparison  of  the  design  architectures  spanning 
from structurally connected to separated spacecraft interferometers. ” 

The  goal  is  not  to  come  up  with  a  single  point  design  that  would  sat isfy  the  TPF  mission 
requirements, but to develop a technique  to fairly evaluate  the relative merits of intrinsically 
different design concepts. 

Consideration  o f  a  single  po int  design  to  satisfy  the  mission  requirements  has  been 
performed  previously  by  different  industrial  teams  such  as  Ball,  TRW,  and  Lockheed 
Martin.  Thus  far,  only a  structurally  connected  system  has  been  thoroughly  considered  and 
proposed.    Comparisons  between  a  structurally  connected  (SCI)  and  a  separated  spacecraft 
interferometer  (SSI)  have  been  performed  at  the  MIT  Space  Systems  Laboratory  by  Surka 
and  Stephenson.    Since  the  scope  they  considered  was  rather  limited,  it  is  not  possible  to 
conclude  from  their studies  that one spacecraft architecture  should  be  chosen over  the other, 
though  the  more  recent  study  by  Stephenson  tends  to  favor  the  SSI  design  for  longer 
interferometer baselines. 

The  level  o f  detail  in  modeling  the  physics,  costs,  operations,  etc,  in  the  TPF  Mission 
Analys is  Software  (TMAS)  was  determined  to  permit  meaningful  comparisons  of  the 
relat ive merits of compet ing architectures.  The team members do not  claim that  the  level o f 
design  detail  presented  in  this  project  is  highly  accurate  in  an  absolute  sense  or  that  the 
current  methodology  provides  sufficient  information  to  begin  the  fabricat ion  phase  for  a 
future TPF mission.  However, the methodology is useful for understanding  the fundamental 
relat ionships and sensit ivit ies between TPF mission des ign parameters.

3.0  The Terrestrial Planet Finder Mission 

3.1  Mission Description 
The National  Aeronaut ics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA)  and  the  scientific  community 
have  recent ly  init iated  the  Origins  Program  to  roadmap  future  space  astronomy  and 
astrophysics  for  the  next  20  years.    The Origins  Program will  develop  the  techno logies  that 
will  enable  putting  in  space  a  succession  of  sophisticated  telescopes,  each  building  on 
scientific  and  techno logical  achievements of  the prior missions.   The purpose of  the Origins 
Program  is  to  help  answer  fundamental  questions  regarding  the  origins  of  life  and  the 
universe such as: 

•  How did the first galaxies form? 
•  How do stars and planetary systems form? 
•  Are there any planets outside our solar system that are capable of sustaining  life? 
•  How did  life originate on Earth? 
• 
Is there  life (however primit ive or evolved) outside our solar system? 

Augmented  with  ground-based  observatories  and  research  and  analys is,  NASA’ s  Origins 
program will  give  our  civilizat ion  a  better  sense  o f  the  universe  around  us  and  our  place  in 
it. 

The  Terrestrial  Planet  Finder  (TPF)  mission  is  one  in  a  series  of  missions  designed  to 
provide  answers  to  the  questions  regarding  extra-solar  planets.
  It  will  leverage  new 
techno logies  and  techniques  demonstrated  on  earlier  missions  in  the  road  map  such  as  the 
Space  Infrared  Telescope  Facility  (SIRTF),  the  Space  Interferometry  Mission  (SIM),  the 
Next  Generat ion Space Telescope  (NGST),  and  Space  Technology  3  (ST3  –  f ormerly Deep 
Space  3  ,  DS3).   SIRTF  will  demonstrate  improvements  in  infrared  detection  techno logy. 
SIM  will  demonstrate  hardware  and  so ftware  packages  for  a  space-based  interferometer  as 
well  as  star-light  nulling,  precision  pathlength  control,  and  general  interferometer 
operations.    NGST  will  demonstrate  techno logies  for  cryogenic  actuators  and  for  precision 
wavelength  control.    TPF  will  serve  as  a  precursor  for  yet  another  series  of  explorat ion 
missions  including the Planet Imager (PI) mission. 

The primary object ive of the TPF mission  is  to  detect  and  to  characterize  Earth-like  planets 
orbiting  nearby stars.  This object ive  requires  the  capability  to detect  radiat ion  emitted  from 
extra-solar  planets  and  to  be  able  to  discriminate  this  radiat ion  from  that  of  the  parent  star. 
The  proposed  technique  for  performing  this  function  is  to  use  a  spaceborne  interferometer. 
By combining the high sensit ivity o f space telescopes with the sharply detailed pictures from 
a  nulling  interferometer,  TPF  will  be  able  to  reduce  the  glare  of  parent  stars  by  a  factor  of 
more than one hundred-thousand to see planetary systems as far away as 50  light  years. 

In addit ion  to measuring  the  size,  temperature,  and  location  of  planets  as  small  as  the  Earth 
in the habitable zones of distant solar systems, TPF will be used  to gather spectroscopic data 
that will allow atmospheric chemists and bio logists to study the concentrations o f gasses  like 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 18 of 175 

carbon  dioxide,  water  vapor,  ozone  and  methane  to  determine  whether  a  planet  someday 
could, or even now does, support life. 

As  well  as  studying  planets  around  nearby,  mature  stars  like  the  sun,  TPF  will  be  used  to 
advance our understanding of how planets  and  their parent  stars  form. The disks  o f  forming 
stars  are  a  few  astronomical  unit s  (AU)  across.  TPF  will  image  planetary  accretion  disks 
with  a  resolut ion  of  a  few  tenths  of  an  AU  to  invest igate  how  gaseous  (Jupiter-like)  and 
rocky  (Earth-like)  planets  form  out  of  disk  material.  By  studying  the  heat  glow  from  dust, 
ice,  and  gasses  such  as  hydrogen  and  carbon  monoxide,  TPF  will  invest igate  whether,  as 
theory predicts,  rocky planets  form  in warmer  regions  and gaseous planets  in  co lder  regions 
while a so lar system is being born. 

3.2  TPF Science 
The  science  requirements  of  the  astrophysics  community  and  the  properties  of  the  parent 
stars  are  crucial  in  designing  the  TPF  and  drive  the  engineering  requirements  for  the 
mission.  Specifically TPF will  be  designed  for  direct  planet  detection  and  for  spectroscopy 
in  the  infrared  regime.    The  three  single  most  crit ical  factors  that  drive  the  scient ific 
performance are: 

• 	 Suppression  o f  parent  star  light  (nulling)  by  a  factor  of  106  over  the  ent ire  diameter  of 
the star, 
• 	 Retention o f maximum transmissivity in the habitable zone (0.5 to 3 AU) around a star, 
• 	 Maintenance  of    the  spacecraft  optics  and  detectors  at  adequately  co ld  temperatures  to 
maximize the SNR  in the 7-17  m range. 

The properties of a particular  star  in  the  target  star populat ion  are very  important,  since  they 
are  direct ly  related  to  the  engineering  requirements  that  must  be  met  to  design  viable  TPF 
architectures and  to conduct  trade studies.   Specifically,  the four properties o f  the parent star 
that will be  invest igated are: 

• 	 Absolute stellar magnitude [M], which drives the depth of null needed, 
• 	 Average  surface  temperature  [K],  which  defines  the  Planck  spectrum  and  drives 
observat ion wavelength selection, 
• 	 Distance from the observer [pc], which drives angular reso lution and baseline  length, 
• 	 Absolute star diameter [km], which drives the width of null.

Figure 1.  Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram for Nearby Stars 

Figure 1  shows  the  so-called Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram.   This diagram  is useful  because 
it  ident ifies a correlat ion between the evo lut ionary state of nearby stars and a combination o f 
their surface  temperature and  their  luminosity.   The  temperature of a star,  in degrees Kelvin, 
decreasing  from  left  to  right,  is  represented  on  the  X-axis.  The  stars  are  grouped  into 
spectral  classes  according  to  their  temperature:  O,  B,  A,  F,  G,  K,  and  M.  G  class  stars  are 
referred  to as being  “ sunlike ” .   The  luminosity metric (L/Lo  ) on  the  right  side  is  the  ratio of 
the  lumino sity  o f  a  star  to  the  lumino sity  of  the  Sun.    The  scale  on  the  left  represents  the 
luminosity  as  the  abso lute  stellar  magnitude M  (not  to  be  confused with  relative  magnitude 
that  amateur  astronomers  car  about).    Astrophysical  observat ions  show  that  stars  are  not 
scattered  randomly  in  the  HR-diagram,  but  that  they  are  grouped  in  certain  clusters  or 
“seque nces”.   The  largest number of stars can be found  in the  “ ma in sequence ”  in the middle 
of  the  diagram  (a);  the  Sun  is  thus  part  of  the  main  sequence  of  stars.  There  is  also  a 
considerable number of stars  in the  “ Giants”  branch  (g)  and  a  sma ller number of  stars  in  the 
“ Supergiants”  branch (c). The number of  “Whi te Dwarfs ” ( d) and  “ Red Dwarfs” ( b)  that can 
be  observed  is  limited  due  to  their  relatively  small  luminosity,  even  though  red  dwarfs  are 
believed  to  comprise  the majority of  the  total  stellar populat ion  in the galaxy.  TPF will be 
searching for  “ earthlike” p lanets around  “ sunlike” st ars.  This limit s the surface  temperatures 
of  the  observed  parent  stars  to  be  in  the  4000-8000  K  range  and  excludes  Supergiants  and 
Dwarfs as candidates.

Figure 2. Distance to Parent Star and Position of Planets 

The maximum distance  to a target star drives  the angular reso lution  that will be necessary  to 
iso late a planet.  The maximum distance has been set at 15 parsecs (about 50  light  years)  for 
the  TPF mission  to  allow  for  a  sufficient ly  large  number  of  candidate  stars  without  making 
the  technical  requirements  overly  difficult.    This  results  in  a  required  angular  reso lut ion  of 
40 milliarcseconds to detect  a planet  as  close  to  the  star  as 0.5 AU  (see Figure 2).  After  the 
addit ional  exclusion of binary  star  systems,  there  are  approximately 150  candidate  stars that 
meet both the temperature and distance requirement s ident ified above. 

3.3  Previous Work and Resources 
Between  1997  and  1998,  three  contracts  were  awarded  to  three  industry  teams  to  design  a 
system  that would meet  the TPF object ives.   All  three  teams developed  proposed  conceptual 
designs  based  on  the  structurally  connected  interferometer  (SCI)  spacecraft  architecture. 
The  other  spacecraft  architectures,  such  as  the  separated  spacecraft  interferometer  (SSI) 
were either considered to be too techno logically challenging or were not considered at all. 

Comparisons  between  a  SCI  concept  and  a  SSI  concept  for  TPF  were  studied  at  the  MIT 
Space Systems Laboratory by Surka  (1996)  and Stephenson (1998).  Surka reported  that  the 
SCI  concept  is  generally  preferable  to  the  SSI  unless  spacecraft  separations  of  greater  than 
hundreds  of  meters  are  required.  In  contrast,  the  report  by  Stephenson  concludes  that  the 
cross-over point where  the SSI  concept  is  “b etter ”  occurs  for  space  interferometer  baselines 
of  less that one hundred meters. 

The  JPL  maintained  TPF  website  provides  a  broad  overview  of  the  TPF  program  that 
includes  a  statement  of  the  mission  and  goals  of  the  TPF  as  well  as  a  description  o f  the 
underlying  science  and  techno logy concepts  invo lved  in  the  design  and  the  operation  of  the 
system.    There  are  sections  that  discuss  the  detection  of  Earth-like  planets,  interferometer 
design  issues, precursor missions,  and possibilit ies  for  astrophysical  imaging.   Also,  there  is 
a  library on  this website  that  is  periodically  updated with  new  publicat ions  that  are  relevant 
to  TPF,  including  topics  such  as  infrared  surveying  of  starburst  galaxies,  investigat ions  of 
planetary format ion, and zodiacal dust gaps caused by the presence of planets. 

In  addit ion  to  the  TPF  website,  JPL  maintains  a  TPF  book  available  in  PDF  format  on  the 
web that provides a more technical and detailed descript ion of  the  topics  that are pertinent  to 
the  TPF  mission.  This  book  contains  chapters  that  discuss  the  important  issues  behind  the 

design  of  TPF,  including  interferometer  properties,  star-light  nulling,  target  stars,  and 
precursor  missions  that  will  provide  TPF  with  the  necessary  techno logy  to  detect  and  to 
characterize planets around nearby stars.

4.0  TPF Mission Requirements 
The  first  activity of  the ASTRO project was to develop  the  system and  design  requirements 
for  the  TPF  mission  from  the  stated  science  object ives  in  enough  detail  to  allow  for  the 
development  of  viable  compet ing  mission  architectures.  These  requirements  are  organized 
into  three  successively  more  engineering-oriented  levels.    The  first  level,  Science 
Requirements / User Needs,  includes a  formal definit ion of  the stated scient ific objectives of 
the mission.    The  second  level  consists  of  TPF  mission  System Requirements  derived  from 
the  Science  Requirements.  The  third  level  contains  Design  Requirements  derived  from  the 
previous  two  levels.   The  requirements have  been documented  in PDF  format  for  electronic 
distribut ion over the internet. 

Addit ionally, a Quality Funct ion Deployment (QFD) analysis was performed  to examine  the 
correlat ion  between  and  among  the  System  Requirements  and  the  Science  Requirements. 
This act ivity is documented in section 4.6 below. 

4.1  TPF Mission Science Requirements 
Also  referred  to  as user needs,  the  science  requirements  define  the  mission  objective.  They 
define  what  the  system  must  do  and  are  the  criteria  by  which  mission  success  will  be 
measured.  For TPF, the system requirements are science object ives defined by  the scient ists 
who  will  be  the  primary  end  users  of  the  system.    It  is  important  to  note  that  user  needs 
specify  “ funct ion”  n ot  form.    User  needs  should  not  be  architecture  dependent  and  should 
avo id  defining  specific  techno logies  unless  they  are  deemed  essential  for  the  successful 
execution of the mission. 

4.2  TPF Mission System Requirements 
The  system  requirements  are  the  highest  level  engineering  requirements  that  describe  how 
the  system  should  perform.  They  define  the  physica l  limitations  of  the  system  without 
specifying  the  “ form”  t he  design  should  take.    System  requirements  are  driven  by  user 
needs, which  is expected, but they are also driven by external  factors.  Some of  these  factors 
include  constraints  due  to  public  opinion,  NASA  budgets,  launch  schedules,  etc.  These 
requirements fall outside the scope of the ASTRO project, but the  influent ial external  factors 
that influence the mission timeline and budget have been considered. 

4.3  TPF Mission Design Requirements 
Design  requirements  are  the  next  lower  level  o f  engineering  requirements  that  begin  to 
define  the  “f orm”   of  the  system.    They  are  driven  by  the  laws  of  phys ics  and  by  standard 
engineer ing practices. 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­

Page 24 of 175 

4.4  Additional TPF Mission Requirements 
In  addit ion  to  the  science  community,  which  is  the  principle  stakeho lder  for  this  mission, 
there  are  a  number  of  other  sources  that  may  contribute  to  the  definit ion  of  user  needs  and 
system  requirements.    For  a  NASA  science  mission  such  as  this,  the  U.S.  tax  payers, 
students,  teachers,  subcontract  engineers,  etc.  will  have  vested  interests  that  are  likely  to 
impose addit ional  constraints on  the  system design.   While  this  influence  is  recognized,  it  is 
outside the scope of the ASTRO project and has not been explicit ly included  in the analys is. 

4.5  Requirements Document Electronic Format 
The  TPF  Mission  Requirements  Document  has  been  implemented  in  an  electronic  format 
that  takes  advantage  of  hypertext  capabilit ies.    The  advantages  of  this  format  are  that  it 
enables  a  more  user  friendly  interact ion  with  the  document,  it  can  simplify  configurat ion 
control,  and  it  can  provide  easy  access  to  additional  contextual  informat ion  regarding  the 
source, intent, and verification methods for each requirement. 

Typical requirements documents have the requirements listed sequent ially, proceeding  to the 
lowest, most complex requirement before returning  to the next  high  level requirement.  This 
organizat ion  provides  an  easy  way  to  trace  changes  in  requirements,  but  is  somewhat 
cumbersome.  The  end  user  is  not  always  interested  in  the  detailed  requirements.
  A 
document  with  hypertext  links  allows  the  end  user  to  navigate  at  the  level  o f  complexity  of 
interest without being encumbered by  lower  level details. 

The  hypertext  electronic  format  can  improve  document  configurat ion  control.  Since  each 
requirement  has  a  well  defined  parent-child  relat ionship  with  the  other  requirements,  it 
becomes easier to trace the  impact of a proposed change to a particular requirement. 

The  context  of  any  requirement  is  essent ial  to  its  effect iveness.    Users  of  the  TPF  mission 
electronic  requirements  document  can  easily  determine  the  intent,  source,  and  intended 
verification  method  of  requirements  by  fo llowing  the  appropriate  hypertext  link.    This 
capability will provide  for program  cont inuity despite  staff  turnover  and  for  better  informed 
decisions when the requirements are reviewed and potentially revised. 

4.6  Quality Function Deployment (QFD) 
Quality Funct ion Deployment  (QFD)  is  a graphical  technique  that  translates  customer needs 
into  the  parameters  or  attributes  of  the  product  and  its  manufacturing  and  Quality  Control 
(QC)  processes,  a  key  element  of  Integrated  Product  Process  Development  (IPPD),  see 
Boppe.
  The  QFD  technique  can  help  to  minimize  human  biases,  prioritize  technical 
requirements, provide requirements traceability, and provide a communicat ion mechanism. 

Customer  requirements  are  the  top-level  Science  Requirements  stated  in  the  TPF  Mission 
Requirements Document.  They are  listed on  the  left  side of  the QFD  (see Figure 3)  and  are 
assigned  a number  that  indicates  their  relat ive  importance  (10  is  the most  important)  among 
the  customer  requirements.  Accross  the  top  of  the  QFD  chart  are  listed  the  high-level 

technical/engineering  requirements.    If  specific  technical  targets  are  known,  they  are 
documented  in the same co lumns at the bottom of the QFD.

Figure 3.  Quality Function Deployment for the TPF Mission 

The  relat ionship  between  the  customer  requirements  and  the  technical  requirements  are 
indicated  at  the  intersections  by  the  numbers  9,  3,  and  1  for  strong,  moderate,  and  weak 
relat ionships.  To generate a cumulative score for each technical requirement, those numbers 
are  mult iplied  by  the  importance  weight  of  the  corresponding  customer  requirements  and 
summed.    These  cumulat ive  scores  are  then  used  to  rank  the  technical  requirements  from  1 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­

Page 26 of 175 

to 10 (10 being most important).  As can be seen in the QFD  for the TPF Mission (Figure 3), 
Baseline Separation, Maximize Spectral Reso lut ion,  Increase Level of Sensit ivity,  Collector 
Aperture,  Combiner  Optics,  and  Infrared  Imaging  Device  have  been  identified  as  the  most 
important technical requirements. 

Another  useful sect ion of the QFD  chart  is  the  Correlat ion Matrix, which  is  the  top  triangle 
sect ion  that  indicates  interactions  among  the  technical  requirements.    An  ‘ x’   symbo l  in  the 
Correlat ion  Matrix  ident ifies  technical  requirements  that  are  interdependent  such  that  both 
may  not  be  optimized  at  the  same  time.    These  represent  some  of  the  primary  trades  that 
must be considered during the mission design process.

5.0  Architectural Design Options 
With the requirements defined, a number of mission architectures were  ident ified and briefly 
examined as candidates for further evaluat ion. 

An  important  assumpt ion  about  the  design  is  that  an  infrared  nulling  interferometer  will  be 
used  to  accomplish  the  TPF  mission.    A  brief  discussion  of  this  technique  including  some 
just ificat ion for this assumpt ion  is  included  in sect ion 5.1 below. 

One  of  the  most  important  trades  with  regard  to  the  TPF  mission  is  to  determine  the  best 
architecture  to  carry  out  the  mission.    The  apertures  can  be  located  on  a  single  structurally 
connected  spacecraft  or  on  a  number  of  different  spacecraft.  Therefore,  in  addit ion  to 
developing  a  generic  spacecraft  operations  scenario  (section  5.2),  five  potential  spacecraft 
architecture  types were  ident ified:    Structurally  Connected,  Separated  Spacecraft,  Tethered, 
Hybrid,  and  Celest ial  Body.    Sections  5.3  through  5.7  provide  brief  descript ions  of  each 
spacecraft concept with its perceived benefits and  liabilit ies. 

5.1  Infrared Nulling Interferometer Technique 
To  achieve  the goal of direct ly detecting  and  characterizing  terrestrial  planets  located  in  the 
habitable zones of other solar systems,  the TPF mission must  use  some  technique  to  prevent 
the  parent  star ’ s  light  from  concealing  the  light  emitted  by  the  planets.    Typically,  the 
intensity  of  the  light  from  a  parent  star  must  be  reduced  by  a  factor  of  about  a  billion  (in 
optical  wavelengths)  to  a  million  (in  thermal  infrared  wavelengths)  to  allow  for  the  direct 
detection of the radiat ion  from a planet.  Consequent ly,  the TPF mission will be designed  to 
operate  in  the  thermal  infrared  regime  to  take  advantage  of  the  higher  relat ive  intensity  o f 
the planets  to their parent stars at these wavelengths.   The  scient ific  community has  selected 
the  nulling  interferometer  technique  over  other  methods,  such  as  a  coronograph  or  an 
occultation spacecraft, as the most viable technique for this mission. 

The  concept  of using  an  interferometer  to  null  out  a  bright  parent  star while  simultaneously 
detecting  a  planet  was  first  proposed  by  Bracewell  and  Macphie  in  1979.  A  nulling 
interferometer  is  very  similar  to  a  convent ional  Michelson  interferometer  except  for  the 
introduction  o f  phase  delays  to  obtain  a  zero  response  at  the  center  of  the  interferometer 
fringe  pattern.   Thus,  the  light  from  a  parent  star  at  the  center  of  the  interferometer  field  of 
view  will  be  "nulled"  out.   For  the  TPF  interferometer  to  detect  a  planet  in  a  star  system 
located  at  a  distance  of  10  parsecs,  an  interferometer  with  a  baseline  of  250  meters  is 
required [Beichman, et. al., 1999] to provide  the minimum starlight  suppression of 106 at the 
inner boundary of  the  habitable  zone.   Since  terrestrial  interferometers  consist ing  of modest 
sized  telescopes  and  baselines  on  the  order  of  hundreds  of  meters  are  currently  under 
construction or are already  in operation,  there clearly exists a  techno logical path  to a similar, 
space-based plat form. 

An  alternative  method  for  masking  the  light  from  the  parent  star  invo lves  the  use  of  a 
coronograph.   This  technique  employs  an  occult ing  mask  in  the  center  of  the  focal  plane  to 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 28 of 175 

suppress  the  on-axis  light.   Addit ionally,  a  second  filter,  called  a  Lyot  stop,  is  frequent ly 
inserted before the detector to mask the  light at the edges of the  image  to  further  increase  the 
signal  to  noise  ratio.   However,  this  technique  has  a  typical  suppression  capability  of  only 
103,  which  is  not  enough  for  the  TPF  mission,  and  is  mo st  applicable  to  filled  aperture 
telescopes, which would  need  to be very  large  (~100s  of meters)  to  satisfy  the  TPF mission 
requirements. 

The occultation concept  invo lves  the placement of a  large disk  in  front  of  the  telescope  such 
that  the  light  from the parent  star will be occluded.   To  implement  this  concept,  a 100 meter 
disk  must  be  located  a  few  hundred  thousand  kilometers  away  from  an  NGST-class 
telescope  before  an  Earth-like  planet  in  nearby  systems  could  be  detected.   To  achieve  the 
required  star-light  suppression  for  the  TPF  mission,  both  the  size  of  the  occult ing  disk  and 
the distance to the telescope would need to be scaled up by a factor of 100. 

By  choosing  to  conduct  observat ions  at  thermal  infrared  wavelengths  using  a  nulling 
interferometer  with  a  sufficient ly  long  baseline,  the  TPF  mission  can  achieve  the  starlight 
suppression  and  resolut ion  levels  required  to  successfully  detect  and  spectrographically 
analyze terrestrial planets orbit ing nearby stars. 

5.2  Spacecraft Operations Scenario 
A generic mission operations scenario was developed  to provide guidance during  the system 
architecture  design  phase.    The  level  of  detail  in  the  scenar io  is  purposely  selected  to  be 
general  enough  to  accommodate  all  potential  spacecraft  architectures  while  being  specific 
enough  to  assist  with  the  select ion  of  subsystem  components  capable  of  sat isfying  the 
mission  requirements.  In  addit ion  to  an  overview  mission  timeline,  a  science  operations 
scenario was developed that focuses on spacecraft operations. 

5.2.1  Mission Timeline 
Figure  4  shows  an  overview  timeline  for  the  TPF  mission.    The  mission  has  been  divided 
into  four  phases:    Pre-launch,  Launch  and  Cruise,  Deployment  and  Science  Mission,  and 
Extended Mission and Spacecraft Terminat ion. 

The Pre-launch phase  includes spacecraft design, construction, test, and  integration act ivit ies 
as  well  as  the  development  of  operations  procedures  and  infrastructure.   There  will  be  a 
substant ial  flow  of  informat ion  from  the  spacecraft  design  team  to  the  operations  team  to 
facilitate  the  development  of  the  operational  procedures.    By  the  end  of  this  phase,  the 
spacecraft  failure modes  and  effects  should be well documented,  the operational  procedures 
for  the  Launch  and  the  Cruise  segments  should  be  mature,  and  the  operational  procedures 
for the Deployment and Science segments should be started. 

There  is  a  large  degree  of  variability  in  length  of  the  Launch  and  Cruise  phase  due  to  the 
system  architecture  selected.  First,  there  may  or  may  not  be  the  need  for  spacecraft 
integrat ion  in  Earth  orbit  fo llowing  launch.    Second,  the  length  of  the  Cruise  segment  is 
strongly  dependent  on  the  selected  solar  orbit  altitude  and  the  final  mass  of  the  spacecraft. 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 29 of 175 

During  the  Cruise  segment,  the  operational  procedures  for  the  Deployment  and  Science 
Phase will be matured and updated based on actual spacecraft health and simulat ion. 

Once  the  spacecraft  arrives  at  the  science  orbit,  there  will  be  an  init ial  period  dedicated  to 
the  deployment  of  the  spacecraft  elements  from  the  Cruise  segment  configurat ion,  init ial 
calibrat ion  of  the  science  instruments,  and  testing  of  the  ground  segment  elements  of  the 
system  with  transmitted  data.    Afterward,  the  active  science  phase  of  the  mission  will  be 
conducted.  The  first  observations will  be  selected  and  scheduled  to maximize  the  expected 
data value  in the event of a spacecraft  failure early in the Science Mission Phase. 

During  the  extended  mission  phase,  operations  will  continue  much  as  they  did  during  the 
Science  Mission  Phase  except  that  there  will  be  a  continuing  evaluat ion  of  the  cost  of 
continuing  operations  given  the  value  o f  the  science  data  being  gathered.    When  the  ratio 
falls  below  an  acceptable  level  (this  could  be  due  to  component  failures,  rising  operations 
costs,  or  lack  o f  qualitat ively  new  data),  the  mission  will  be  terminated.  Afterwards,  the 
operations  team  will  st ill  be  responsible  for  complet ing  the  permanent  archival  of  science 
data and the maintenance of processes to access that data.

5.2.2  Science Operations Functional Flow 
Science  operations  consist  of  the  ground  support  activit ies  required  to  fulfill  the  science 
requirements of  the  TPF  mission  dur ing  the  Science Mission  Phase.  The  primary  dut ies  of 
the TPF operations group will be  to  schedule  science  act ivit ies,  to disseminate  science  data, 
and  to maintain  the  health  of  the  spacecraft.  A  diagram  o f  the  funct ional  flow  is  shown  in 
Figure 5 and  is described below.

Figure 5.  TPF Science Operations Functional Flow 

A  process  must  be  established  to  receive  science  target  requests  from  the  research 
community  and  then  to  rank  and  schedule  them  for  observat ion  by  the  spacecraft.  Early  in 
the  mission,  there  will  be  a  focus  on  acquiring  the  mo st  valuable  subset  of  data  as  soon  as 
possible  to  protect  against  an  early  failure  of  the  spacecraft.    Later  in  the  mission,  factors 
such as fuel and power management will more heavily influence target scheduling. 

Fo llowing  appropriate  commanding  of  the  spacecraft,  the  spacecraft  funct ions  will  be 
executed to obtain the requested data and transmit it  back to Earth.  The  transmitted data will 
consist  of both  the  science data  and  the  spacecraft  status  and  engineering  data.  The  science 
data  must  be  permanent ly  archived  once  it  has  been  verified  to  be  free  of  transmission 
defects.  Then,  the  science  data  may  be  distributed  to  both  the  research  community  and  to 
the public through various means such as the Internet or its successor. 

The  spacecraft  status  data  will  be  used  to  monitor  expected  spacecraft  performance 
including  failures and  consumable margins.    This  data  can  be  used  to  update the  simulat ion 
models  o f  the  spacecraft  performance  to  assist  with  the  evaluat ion  of  updated  operations 
procedures  that  would  be  designed  to  prolong  the  operational  life  o f  the  spacecraft  or  to 
improve  the  science  instrument  capabilit ies.    These  updated  procedures  would  then 
influence subsequent scheduling and spacecraft commanding.

5.2.3  Spacecraft Science Operations Functional Flow 
Once  on  station  at  the  destinat ion  orbit,  the  TPF  spacecraft will  need  to  perform  a  series  of 
coordinated  activit ies  to  accomplish  the  science  gathering  objectives.    These  act ivit ies  are 
shown in Figure 6 and are discussed below.

Figure 6.  TPF Spacecraft Science Operations Functional Flow 

The  cycle  begins  with  the  reception  of  instructions  for  a  science  target.  This  can  be  from 
either a single, dedicated ground instruction, or from a sequenced  list of  targets.  In addit ion, 
the  format  of  this  request  may  vary  depending  on  the  established  ground  control/spacecraft 
automat ion balance.  This request must be stored  in the spacecraft ’ s memory in case a repeat 
of the operation is needed. 

The next steps are to establish  the required baseline separat ion distances of  the apertures and 
to point  them at  the requested target.  This will  require periodic  re-calibrat ion of  the  attitude 
control system using reference stars to maintain the desired  level of po int ing accuracy. 

Once  the  imaging  cycle  starts,  it  will  be  necessary  to  control  the  point ing  accuracy  and  the 
internal  metrology  to  within  t ight  tolerances  while  the  collectors  move  through  a 
predetermined  pattern  (usually  circular)  to  collect  the  science  light.   During  this  time,  the 
integrated image data is captured by the optical instruments. 

When  the  imaging  cycle  is  completed,  the  integrated  image  data  must  be  captured,  stored, 
and processed (labeled, compressed, etc.)  in preparation for transmission back  to Earth.  The 
spacecraft must be reasonably capable of detecting and correcting errors in this process so  as 
to  maximize  its  capacity  to  deliver  the  highest  possible  data  fidelity.    The  process  will  be 
concluded with  the  transmission  of  science  data,  either  one  image  at  a  time  or  after  several 
have been accumulated.

5.3  Structurally Connected Interferometer 
This  spacecraft  architecture  consists  of  a  single  spacecraft  that  incorporates  trusses  or other 
rigid members  to  locate  the  interferometer  components.  The  configuration may  be  linear or 
nonlinear and may or may not be symmetric. 

Deployable  trusses have been used on a number of other  spacecraft  and have  been proposed 
for  both the Space  Interferometry Mission  (SIM)  and  the Next Generat ion  Space  Telescope 
(NGST) missions. 

The perceived advantages of using this technique  include: 
• 	 The  truss  provides  passive  coarse  posit ioning  and  angular  point ing  control  of  the 
interferometer components. 
• 	 Assuming  the  optical  instruments  can  be  placed  near  the  spacecraft  center  of  mass,  this 
architecture  requires  less  propellant  usage  during  rotational  maneuvers  (such  as  during 
science operations.) 
• 	 Previous studies have favored the use of a truss architecture, especially  for short baseline 
separation requirements. 

The perceived disadvantages associated with this architecture are: 
• 	 Truss deployment may be complicated. 
• 	 The  variability o f aperture  configurat ions  is  limited,  including  maximum  separation  and 
minimum separation. 
• 	 More effort (propellant) may be required to retarget the array. 
• 	 Less  graceful degradation  since  component  replacement  would  likely  invo lve  the  ent ire 
truss.

5.4  Separated Spacecraft Interferometer 
A  separated  spacecraft  architecture  places  the  apertures  and  the  combiner  optics  on 
independent  spacecraft  plat forms.    Obviously,  this  architecture  can  accommodate  the 
greatest  variability  o f  collector  configurat ions  spanning  the  range  of  linear,  nonlinear, 
symmetric, and non-symmetric. 

In  the  communicat ions  industry,  systems  that  use  a  large  number  of  satellites  to  provide 
global  coverage  have  been  proposed,  developed,  and  utilized.  The  use  of  a  separated 
spacecraft  architecture  for  interstellar  imaging  is  current ly  being  undertaken  by  the  NASA 
Space Techno logy 3  (ST3,  formerly Deep Space 3, DS3) mission  that  is planned  to  conduct 
interferometry  using  two  format ion  flying  spacecraft.    Separations  o f  up  to  1000  m  are 
currently envisioned  for this mission.   The format ion flying and  the  interferometer operation 
strategies  developed  for  the  ST3 mission  are  directly  applicable  to  a  TPF  mission  that  uses 
this spacecraft architecture. 

The perceived advantages of this architecture include: 
• 	 The  collectors  can  be  reconfigured  to  virtually  any  format ion  provided  that  a  minimum 
separation distance  is maintained. 
• 	 This  architecture  can  exhibit  graceful  degradat ion  and  can  accommodate  incremental 
upgrades more easily than most other configurations since each spacecraft is independent. 
• 	 There  will  be  increased  flexibility  in  launching  the  array  since  these  smaller  spacecraft 
can be  launched separately. 
• 	 Re-targeting maneuvers  require minimal effort  (propellant)  since  each  spacecraft  can  be 
re-oriented  individually. 

The perceived disadvantages of this architecture are: 
• 	 Act ive format ion flying sensors and controls must be developed  for this architecture.  To 
date, spacecraft formation flying techno logy has yet to be demonstrated. 
• 	 Propellant  expenditure  to  maintain  formation  may  cause  contaminat ion  of  the  infrared 
optics. 
• 	 The mission  lifet ime will be dependent on onboard propellant loads.

5.5  Tethered Spacecraft Interferometer
A  tethered  architecture  consists  of  separate  collector  and  combiner  plat forms  connected  by
tethers.    In  this  applicat ion,  a  tether  is  considered  to  be  a  structural  element  that  may  only
transmit tension  loads.

Tethered  satellites  have  been  flown  as  part  of  the  TSS-1  and  TSS-1R  (Reflight)    ,  with
somewhat  dubious  success.  Even  though  science  data  was  collected,  both  the  spacecraft
have been  lost. In many respects, however,  the application o f  the space  tethers  techno logy  to
the TPF is new, as tethers will be used mainly for format ion flight.

The perceived advantages of the tethered architecture include:
•  Tethers  can  provide  the  forces  required  to  maintain  the  required  relat ive  separat ion
distances between the collectors and the combiner.
•  Tethers have a  lower aspect ratio and a  lower mass than an equivalent  length of truss.
•  The  collector  baseline  length  can  also  be  easily  varied  using  appropriate  reeling
mechanisms and maneuvers.
•  The  tethers  provide  a  sort  of  ‘umbilical  cord’  to  the  main  spacecraft  through  which
signals, or even power, can flow, thus  lowering the complexity o f the collector plat form.

The perceived disadvantages of the tethered architecture include:
•  This  architecture  is  characterized  by  extremely  complex  dynamics  that  may  be
impossible to determinist ically model, simulate, or control.
•  The  angular  momentum  of  the  system  must  be  carefully  managed  during  operations  to
maintain the correct spin axis, rotation rate, tether tension, and spacecraft separation.
•  Collector  configurat ions  may  be  more  limited  than  for  the  separated  spacecraft  case  –
non-symmetric and non-planar configurations may be particularly difficult.

5.6  Hybrid Interferometer 
The  hybrid  architecture  can  consist  of  any  combinat ion  of  structurally  connected,  tethered, 
and  separated  spacecraft  elements.   One  simple  example  configurat ion  is  a  pair  of  short 
baseline,  structurally  connected  interferometers  flown  in  format ion  to  create  a  longer 
combined  baseline.  The potential  advantage  of  a  hybrid  design  is  that  it  could  make  use  of 
the best characterist ics o f  the different designs, while at  the same  time reducing  the  effect  of 
their  weaknesses.    However,  this  benefit  may  come  with  the  cost  of  increasing  the 
complexity o f both the spacecraft design and of the operations processes. 

Figure 10.  Hybrid Interferometer Example 

5.7  Celestial Body Interferometer 
The  final  architecture  considered  was  the  use  of  the  Moon  or  an  appropriate  asteroid  as  a 
plat form  for  the  TPF  interferometer.   The  interferometer  elements  would  be  landed  and 
deployed on the surface of the celest ial body. 

A significant amount of expert ise has been developed to  conduct Earth based  interferometry. 
This  exper ience  may  be  directly  applied  to  the  operation  of  an  interferometer  located  on 
another astronomical  body.  However, a major  engineer ing  project  on  the  surface  of  another 
celest ial body has never been realized. 

The perceived advantages of this technique  include: 
• 	 The  celest ial  body  itself  provides  coarse  position  control.  If  the  body  is  not  seismically 
active, only minor effects, such as thermal deformat ions, will occur. 
• 	 A  telescope  on  a  celest ial  body  could  be operated  in  the  same manner  as  an Earth-based 
one,  but  without  the  obstacle  to  astronomical  observat ions  represented  by  a  significant 
atmosphere. 
• 	 The absence o f a need for fuel once the components have been configured means that the 
primary  limit  on  spacecraft  lifet ime  is  removed:  the  mission  can  nominally  last  much 
longer than a spacecraft-based mission. 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­

Page 36 of 175 

• 	 Graceful  degradation  and  incremental  upgrades  are  assured  by  allowing  for  component 
addit ion and removal from the array. 
• 	 The host body may provide a virtually  infinite capacity heat sink  for  the thermal control 
subsystem. 

The perceived disadvantages of this technique  include: 
• 	 There  are  significant  technical  difficult ies  associated  with  landing,  deploying  and 
assembling an interferometer on a celestial body. 
• 	 The  apertures  will  be  fixed,  or  moving  on  some  kind  o f  tracks:  in  both  cases,  the 
baseline range may be significant ly  limited. 
• 	 The  line  of  sight  of  the  interferometer  will  be  limited  by  the  orbital  and  rotation 
properties  of  the  host  body.    At  least  half  o f  the  sky  will  be  obscured  by  the  host  body 
itself, and a significant part of the sky will be at very low elevation angles throughout the 
year. This means  that  even  if  an object  is observable,  the projected baseline will be  very 
small, thus  limit ing the achievable reso lut ion. 
• 	 In  the  case  in which  a massive  body  is  selected  as  the host,  addit ional  structures may  be 
required to sustain the weight of the optics.

6.0  Architectural Design Approach 

6.1  Identify Architecture Metrics 
A  need  exists  to  develop  a  uniform  framework  to  compare  different  TPF  architectures  ­
structurally  connected,  separated  spacecraft,  tethered,  and  their  permutations.  The  systems 
engineering  methodology  chosen  to  develop  this  framework  is  GINA  - the  Generalized 
Informat ion Network Analysis methodology for Distributed Satellite Systems  [Shaw,  1998]. 
The  foundat ion  behind  the  GINA  methodology  is  the  belief  that  all  satellite  systems  are 
informat ion  disseminators  that  can  be  represented  as  informat ion  transfer  networks  [Shaw, 
1998]. A summary of the procedural steps in the GINA methodology is listed below. 

1. 	 Define Customer Requirements 
• 	 Ident ify the customer. 
• 	 Define the customer requirements. 

2. 	 Define Capability Requirements 
• 	 Translate the customer requirements into the four Capability  “ Quality o f Service ” 
parameters:  iso lat ion, rate, integrity, and availability. 

3. 	 A) Develop System Metrics 
• 	 Define  the  performance,  cost  per  funct ion,  and  adaptability metrics  by which  all 
proposed system architectures will be compared and evaluated. 

B) Perform Functional Analysis 
• 	 Develop a funct ional flow diagram o f the system. 

4. 	 Derive Top-Level Architecture(s) 
• 	 Allocate values to the key design parameters identified  in 3B. 

5. 	 Evaluate Architecture(s) 
• 	 Perform  a  system  abstraction  by  defining  the  simplest  models  that  still 
quant itatively capture these tradable design parameters. 
• 	 Using  these models,  calculate  the  capability, performance,  cost  per  funct ion,  and 
adaptability  o f  each  architecture  that  meets  or  exceeds  the  specified  capability 
“ Quality of Service”  parameters. 

6. 	 Select Final Architecture 
• 	 Select  the  architecture  that provides  the best  overall  system value  in  terms of  the 
cost per funct ion metric. 

Through  these  steps,  GINA  allows  the  systems  engineer  to  make  meaningful,  quant itative 
trades  at  the  conceptual  design  level  by  direct ly  relat ing  lifecycle  performance  to  lifecycle 
cost.

Capability Requirements 
In the GINA methodology, the capability o f an architecture  is characterized by four  “ Quality 
of Service”  parameters  that  relate  to  the  detection  process,  and  to  the  quant ity,  quality,  and 
availability o f  the  informat ion  that  is processed  through the network.  These  four  parameters 
are  signal  iso lat ion,  informat ion  rate,  informat ion  integrity,  and  the  availability  of  these 
services  over  time  [Shaw,  1998].  Once  formulated,  these  four  parameters  serve  as  the 
minimum  instantaneous  capability  requirements  the  system  must  meet  to  satisfy  the 
customer.  These  metrics  assess  how  well  the  aforement ioned  customer  requirements  are 
met. 

• 
Isolat ion 
Isolat ion  refers  to  the  ability o f  a  system  to  iso late  and  distinguish  informat ion  signals  from 
different  sources within  the  field  o f  view.    For TPF,  the  system’ s  angular  resolut ion,  which 
is  a  funct ion  of  the  maximum  vector  baseline  between  a  pair  of  collectors,  determines  the 
smallest sized objects the SSI can image and discriminate between in the field o f view. 

•  Rate 
Rate measures  the  speed  at which  the  system  transfers  information  between  the  sources  and 
sinks  in  the  network.  In  TPF,  the  imaging  rate  is  simp ly  the  total  number  of  images  the 
system  can  produce  per  unit  time  and  varies  for  each  of  the  three  modes  of  operation  ­
surveying,  imaging, and spectroscopy. 

• 
Integrity 
Integrity  is  a  measure  of  the  quality  o f  the  information  being  transferred  through  the 
network.  In the case of TPF,  the  integr ity of an  individual  image  is  a  funct ion of the  signal-
to-noise  ratio  (SNR)  and  the  u-v  coverage  used  to  obtain  that  image.  The  u-v  coverage  can 
be quant itatively evaluated by  calculat ing  the mean  square  error  (MSE) of  the  image, which 
is  a  compar ison  between  an  idealized  po int  spread  funct ion  (PSF)  and  the  true  PSF  for  a 
particular u-v  coverage  [Kong, 1998].  TPF  architectures with greater  integrity will produce 
images with less ambiguity. 

•  Availability 
Finally,  availability  characterizes  the  instantaneous  probability  that    informat ion  symbo ls 
are  being 
transferred  through  the  network  between  all  o f  the  sources  and  sinks.    TPF 
targets  close  to  the  sun,  or  other  targets  whose  imaging  needs  vio late  sun  avo idance  angles 
within  the  optical  train,  reduce  the  availability  of  the  system.    The  actual  imaging  time 
versus  the  time  to  complete  other  tasks  such  as  calibrat ion  and  retargeting  also  affects  the 
availability o f the system. 

System Metrics 
To compare all  the different architectural concepts  that are formulated  in  the design  iteration 
loop,  GINA  uses  a  quant ifiable  set  of  metrics  –   capability,  performance,  cost  per  funct ion, 
and  adaptability  [Shaw,  1998].   The  capability  metrics  have  been  already  covered.    The 
remaining  three  metrics  are  discussed  below.    These  are  the  metrics  that  will  be  used  to 
evaluate and compare all of the TPF architectures. 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 39 of 175 

•  Performance 
While  the  four  capability  “ Quality  o f  Service”  par ameters  introduced  in  the  previous  slide 
measure  how  well  the  architecture  meets  the  capability  requirements  at  any  instantaneous 
point  in time, the performance metric measures how the architecture satisfies  the demands of 
the market  over  the  ent ire  life  o f  the  mission.    For  TPF,  the  performance  may  be  expressed 
as the total number of images the system produces over the mission design life. 

To calculate  this quant ity, however,  the addit ional complicat ion of taking  into  account  all of 
the  possible  failures  that  may occur  within  the  different  components  of  the  system must  be 
taken  into  account.  As  individual  payloads  or  satellites  fail  over  time,  the  imaging  rate  of 
the  system will decrease while  attempt ing  to maintain  the  same pre-failure  level o f  integrity 
(image  ambiguity).  Conversely,  an  identical  imaging  rate  could  be  maintained,  but  only  by 
sampling  fewer spatial  frequencies  (u-v  po ints)  in  each  image,  thus  reducing  the  integrity  of 
the  images.  To  take  into  account  potential  failures  and  the  effect  they  have  on  system 
performance, a reliability model is needed. 

•  Cost Per Funct ion 
The cost per funct ion metric provides a clear measure of the cost of an architecture versus  its 
performance.  It  is  a  measure  of  the  cost  to  achieve  a  common  level  o f  performance  and 
includes  expected  development,  launch,  failure  compensation,  and  operations  costs. 
Examples  include  the  cost  per  billable  minute  of  a  telecommunicat ions  system  or  the  cost 
per megabyte of data for a weather reconnaissance system.  For TPF, the cost per function is 
defined as the cost per image, and  is calculated by dividing  the  total lifecycle cost of TPF by 
the total number of images  it produces over its mission life. 

•  Adaptability 
In  GINA,  adaptability  is  a  measure  of  how  flexible  an  architecture  is  to  changes  in  design 
assumpt ions  and mission  requirements.  In one  sense,  adaptability may  be  thought  of  as  the 
sensit ivity  or  elast icity  o f  the  cost  per  funct ion  of  a  particular  architecture  to  incremental 
changes  in  an  assumption  or  requirement.    For  the  TPF  mission,  potential  assumpt ions  that 
could  be  altered  to measure  architecture  sensit ivity  include  component  costs,  learning  curve 
slopes,  and  component  reliabilit ies.  In  another  sense,  adaptability may  be  thought  of  as  the 
flexibility  of  a  particular  architecture  to  a  new  set  of  mission  requirements,  such  as  the 
mission design life.  An example of flexibility for TPF might be the ability of an architecture 
to transit ion from a planetary detection mission to a  mission o f astrophysical imaging. 

6.2  Define the Architecture Trade Space 
Trade Analysis 
A  trade  analys is  helps  to  ident ify  the  dependencies  between  different  aspects  of  the  system 
design.    The  analys is  typically  begins  by  defining  top-level  system  trades  and  cont inues  to 
lower  level  trades  for  a  comparison  of  different  subsystem  components  if  fidelity  needs 
require  it.  During  the  trades,  metrics  are  used  that  quantify  the  trade  analys is  to  determine 
the  performance  capability  o f  each  candidate  architecture.  The  trade  studies  ident ify  the 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 40 of 175 

aspects  of  the  system  design  that  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  overall  performance. 
More importantly, the overall goal of the trade analysis  is to  indicate the best  alternatives  for 
the  system  design  to  clarify  the  cho ice  of  architecture(s)  that  will  be  carried  through  the 
remainder of the design process. 

Top Level System Trades 
The  first  step  in  the  trade  analysis  is  to  ident ify  the  major  top-level  trades  that  drive  the 
general  system  design.    The  fundamental  system  trade  that  has  the  greatest  impact  on  the 
overall design  is  the architecture comparison.   Each option  implies  substant ial differences  in 
system  design  and  operation  that  must  be  ident ified  and  understood  before  overall 
performance and cost can be evaluated. 

There  are  other  important  top-level  trades  that  involve  the  comparison  o f  different  design 
alternat ives  to  find  the best balance between performance  and  cost.   First  of  all,  the  selected 
orbit,  as  well  as  the  requirements  on  the  observat ion  time  and  image  quality,  strongly 
influence  the  interferometer  configurat ion  (aperture  number,  diameter,  and  location).    The 
orbit  is  related  to  the  noise  sources  that  TPF  must  overcome,  including  the  local  zodiacal 
cloud  and  the  Sun.   The  observing  t ime  and  image  quality  requirements  affect  the  number 
and diameter of the apertures.  A  larger  number  of  apertures  and  a  greater  aperture  diameter 
tend to decrease the observing t ime and  increase the image quality. 

Another  trade  concerns  the  impact  of  mission  lifet ime,  no ise  sources,  and  user  needs  on 
target select ion.  The mission  lifet ime places a maximum  limit on the number of  targets that 
can be observed. 

Noise  sources  such  as  zodiacal  clouds,  the  Sun,  close  binary  star  systems,  and  other  bright 
astrophysical objects  limit  the number of  target  stars  that  can be observed.   Finally,  the user 
ult imately  decides  which  targets  have  the  highest  priority  and  in  what  order  they  will  be 
observed. 

Addit ional  trades  are  more  specific  to  the  spacecraft  design.    Parameters  such  as  orbit, 
architecture, specific functional requirements, and mission lifet ime  impact the spacecraft  bus 
subsystem  and  thus  impose  a  minimum  bus  performance  level  needed  to  maintain  the 
funct ionality  o f  the  total  spacecraft.    Also,  the  system  architecture  is  limited  by  the 
maximum  mass  and  size  of  the  system  due  to  requirements  set  by  the  launch  and  transit 
vehicle, deployment method, general operation, and overall performance. 

The  final  top-level  trades  concern  on-board  autonomy  versus  ground  control  and  overall 
system  cost  versus  capability  and  reliability.    On-board  autonomy  allows  for  minimal 
maintenance  of  the  spacecraft  and  a  small  operations  crew  but  software  complexity  is 
sometime  difficult  to  handle.    Ground  control  helps  increase  the  system  flexibility  but 
increases  costs  due  to  a  large  operations  crew.    Finally,  The  trade  concerning  overall  cost, 
common  to all space systems, seeks  to find a balance  between cost  and  performance.  All o f 
these trades form the  init ial analysis o f each proposed system design.

Initial Trade Analysis Indications 
An  init ial  examinat ion  of  the  top-level  system  trades  identified  certain  design  alternat ives 
that  were  significant  design  drivers.    The  system  architecture  drives  every  other  level  o f 
system  design  by  defining  the  general  design  framework  that  will  set  the  bounds  for  all 
subsequent  system  engineering.    The  interferometer  configuration,  which  includes  the 
aperture  number,  diameter,  and  locat ion,  direct ly  affects  the  ability  o f  the  system  to  obtain 
useful  images  thereby  driving  overall  performance.    The  system  orbit  determines  the  no ise 
sources that must factored  in  to  the system design as well as  the spacecraft bus requirements 
concerning  power,  communicat ions,  GNC,  etc.
  Mission  lifet ime  defines  the  minimum 
capability  and  reliability  o f  all  system  components  to  ensure  that  the  system  will  have  an 
adequate  level  of  performance  throughout  its  lifet ime.    Image  quality  requirements  impact 
the  system  configuration  as well  as  the  payload  systems  so  that  the  incident  science  light  is 
synthesized  to  a  useful  image.    Finally,  the  cost  drives  the  maximum  capability  and 
reliability that can be  included  in the final system design. 

6.3  Initial Downselect to Two Spacecraft Architectures 
The ASTRO  team,  limited  by  t ime  and  manpower  constraints,  chose  to  concentrate  on  two 
architectures for further evaluation. The fo llowing chart was used to just ify the downselect.

Narrow Down to SCI and SSI 
Once  the  system  design  was  narrowed  down  to  two  architectural  options,  SCI  and  SSI, 
certain  top-level system  trades specific  to the chosen architecture needed  to be defined.  The 
trades for the  structurally connected  interferometer  concern  the  impact of  structure material, 
dynamics,  and  system  construction  on  the  number  and  location  of  the  apertures  as  well  as

the  dependency  of  baseline  range,  image  quality,  and  mission  lifet ime  on  the  precision 
system deployment range and structural stability and rigidity.   Trades specific  to  a  separated 
spacecraft  interferometer  invo lve  the  same  system  performance  parameters  but  relate  them 
to  format ion  flying  strategy  and  control,  optical  delay  line  range  and  capability,  and 
available  propellant  for  station  keeping  and  maneuvering.    These  trades,  along  with  the 
general top level system trades, aided  in the select ion of a specific system architecture. 

SCI Trade Space 
In  the  structurally  connected  architecture,  in  particular  a  truss  structure,  some  o f  the 
available  truss  types  are  the  traditional  boom  truss  and  the  innovative  scissoring  truss.  In 
both  these  trusses,  the  components  (such  as  collector)  are  generally  locked  down  onto  the 
truss, though  they  can be placed on different  truss  segments.   In  a  tradit ional  truss,  the  truss 
segments  remain  fixed  relat ive  to  each other.  Hence,  it  is  not  possible  to  physically  change 
the  relat ive  separation  between  the  co llector  mirrors  without  affecting  the  truss  segments. 
One  possible  method  to  change  the  baseline  separation  between  the  co llector  mirrors  is  to 
vary  the project ion of  the  truss onto a plane perpendicular  to the array’ s  line-of-sight  (LOS). 
In  this  case,  the  LOS  of  the  array  is  no  longer  normal  to  the  array.  This  method  requires 
delay lines in order to interfere the same wavefront coming from the target as the LOS of the 
array is changed.   If TPF were to use a truss structure, one possibility  is  to build on  the Able 
Engineering ’ s  ADAM  truss  developed  for  use  on  the  International  Space  Station.
  The 
scissoring  truss  is  an  idea  of  placing  the  pivot  of  the  different  truss  segments  on  the 
combiner module.   In  this  case,  the  baseline  separat ion  between  the  apertures  can  be  varied 
by changing  the angle between  the  truss segments while  the pathlength  from the  collector  to 
the  combiner  module  remains  the  same  (assuming  that  the  LOS  of  the  array  is  st ill 
perpendicular  to  the  array).  Though  an  interesting  idea,  the  operation  of  a  scissoring  truss 
remains to be demonstrated. 

In  the  case where more  than  three modules  (coll.  and  comb.)  are  required,  deployment of a 
mult i-element  structure  may  prove  to  be  complicated.   Since  the  separat ion  between  the 
apertures  is  fixed  by  the  truss,  the  maximum  separat ion  between  the  apertures  is  somewhat 
limited by the maximum extension of the truss. 

SSI Trade Space 
In order to  detect  a planet using  a nulling  interferometer,  the  interferometer  must  be  rotated 
in order  to  increase  the probability o f detecting  the planet.  This  is  especially  true  if a  linear 
array  is  used.  Hence,  in  the  separated  spacecraft  architecture,  the  best  maneuver  profiles 
that will give us the best chances to detect a planet should be determined. 

Two  different  types  of  maneuvering  profiles  that  were  considered  by  Stephenson  (though 
there  are  many  more).   A  circular  maneuvering  profile  allows  the  separation  between  the 
collector  apertures  to  remain  constant  -  which  is  also  a  feature  of  rotating  the  tradit ional 
truss.   However,  in  order  to maintain  the  same  separat ion  at  all  t imes,  constant  thrusting  of 
the spacecraft  is required. 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 43 of 175 

A square maneuvering profile, however, requires  the spacecraft  to follow square  trajectories. 
The  two  square  trajectories  considered  by  Stephenson  are  squares  inscr ibed  in  circular 
trajectories  (equal  diagonal)  and  square  trajectories  having  the  same  per imeter  as  circular 
trajectories  (equal  perimeter).  In  this  case,  the  baseline  separat ion  between  the  spacecraft 
varies  since  the  combiner  spacecraft  remains  stationary  at  the  center.  The  science  light 
pathlength  from  the  target,  however,  remains  the  same.    The  propellant  expenditure  in  this 
profile may not be as high since propellant  is required  to change  the spacecraft direct ionality 
only  at  the  corners  of  the  squares.    This,  however,  assumes  that  observat ions  can  be  made 
while  the  spacecraft  are  in  motion,  a  techno logy  that  has  yet  to  be  proven  but  may  be 
demonstrated in the DS3 mission. 

In  order  to  format ion  fly  these  separated  spacecraft,  active  format ion  flying  controls  to 
cent imeter  levels  of  accuracy  are  required.    Propellant  expenditure  to  provide  this  active 
control may  be high and may result  in contaminat ion of the  infrared  optics.    The  propulsive 
system  must  be  able  to  provide  a  large  enough  impulse  to  change  the  heading  of  the 
spacecraft  at  the  corners  of  the  squares  as  well  as  the  small  impulses  for  centimeter  level 
control. 

6.4  Determine Meaningful TPF Model Components (Macro-Modules) 
The  chart  in  Figure  13  is  a  cornerstone  of  the  approach  taken  since  it  establishes  the 
relat ionship  between  the  trade  space  for  TPF  and  the  metrics  by  which  compet ing 
architectures were  judged.  It  contains  the  attributes  that  distinguish  individual  architectures. 
Notice  the  fundamental  relationships  between  the  elements  of  the  design  vector  and  the 
capability  metrics.  For  example,  the  number  of  apertures  in  the  system  will  direct ly  affect 
the  ability  to  shape  the  transmissivity  funct ion.  This  dictates  the  sharpness  in  the  rise  of  the 
transmissivity  at  the  boundary  between  the  exo-zodi  and  the  habitable  zone.  Hence,  the 
number of apertures drives the  iso lation metric (angular resolut ion). 

The  different  attributes  can  be  lumped  into  groups  of  modeling  needs  that  allow  the 
recognit ion of important differences between compet ing architectures. These groups direct ly 
determined  the  macro-modules  that  would  be  required  to  capture  the  TPF-relevant 
relat ionships  o f  physics,  cost  and  systems  engineering  trades.  Thus,  the  level  of  modeling 
detail is high only for aspects  that matter to TPF and help dist inguish  trends within  the trade 
space. As  ment ioned  before,  the  shape  of  the  transmiss ivity  function,  dynamic  stability  and 
thermal control are  very  important  for  the  success  of TPF.    The  communicat ion  system,  on 
the  other  hand,  was  only  modeled  to  the  level  of  detail  necessary  to  obtain  a  complete 
mission design. For example, a  link budget  is  included but not a detailed analys is of  t ime vs. 
frequency division mult iplexing. This might be a key driver  for other trade analyses, such as 
for a  satellite communicat ions constellat ion, but not for TPF.

6.5  Analysis Software Development Process 
The  development  of  the  TPF  Mission  Analysis  So ftware  (TMAS)  entailed  eight  discreet 
steps, some of which were executed in parallel: 

1.  Define S/W Object ives and Requirements 
2.  Define S/W Macro-Modules 
3.  Define All Interfaces 
4.  Define S/W Sub-Modules 
5.  Code Modules 
6.  Test Code 
7.  Integrate Code 
8.  Benchmark Sanity Check 

The  first  step  entails  defining  exact ly what  the  user would  like  the  software  to  do.   For  this 
project,  the  objective  was  to  create  a  software  tool  to  enable  comparisons  of  different  TPF 
designs  on  order  to  map  out  the  system  trade-space.   The  required  so ftware  inputs  are  the 
elements  of  the  design  vector  (orbit,  number  of  apertures,  architecture,  and  aperture 
diameter), and the desired outputs are the GINA metrics. 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 45 of 175 

After  defining  the  S/W  object ives  and  requirements,  the  S/W  macro-modules  must  be 
defined.  Macro-modules  represent  dist inct  aspects  of  the  design  which  have  high  coupling 
within  each other, but  low  coupling between  each  other,  allowing  each macro-module  to  be 
coded  individually  by  an  individual/team  with  expert ise  in  that  area.   TMAS  contains  six 
macro-modules:  Environment,  Aperture  Configurat ion,  Spacecraft  (Payload  and  Bus), 
Structures/Control/Dynamics, Operations, and GINA. 

Once  these macro-modules  are defined,  the  interfaces  (variable  inputs  and outputs)  between 
them must  be  explicit ly  agreed  upon  by  all  o f  the  programmers.  This  ensures  compat ibility 
between modules and speeds up the integration process.   Interface definit ion  is carried out  in 
parallel  with  the  select ion  of  the  macro  and  sub-modules,  and  is  documented  in  the  N2 
diagram. 

The  sub-modules  are  a  divis ion  of  each  macro-module  into  its  core  components.  For 
example,  each  spacecraft  subsystem  is  a  sub-module  in  the  spacecraft  macro-module.  It  is 
important  that all of  the code be  thoroughly documented at this stage  for  later  understanding 
and easy modification. 

As  the  modules  are  completed,  they  are  integrated  into  a  single  “ Master ”   code.   In  parallel 
with  both  the  coding  and  the  integration,  every  module  is  continuously  tested,  both  for 
correctness and for compat ibility. 

Finally,  after  all  o f  the  code  has  been  integrated,  simu lat ions  are  run  for  existing  TPF 
designs.  By  comparing  the  TMAS  results  with  this  independent  source  of  design  data, 
modeling  errors  are  ident ified  and  the  fidelity  o f  the  ent ire  simulat ion  is  improved  through 
an  iterative  process.  Once  the  user  is  comfortable  with  the  fidelity  o f  the  software, 
simulat ions may be run to map out the system trade-space. 

6.6  Module Development Steps 
A  module  is  a  Mat lab  m-file  that  models  a  specific  subsystem  or  funct ion  within  the 
mission.  The  purpose  of  the  modules  is  to  develop  a  systemat ic  tool  that  sizes  the 
subsystems  within  an  architecture  for  a  given  set  of  inputs.   If  implemented  correctly,  the 
modules  should  also  aid  in  the  systems  analys is  methodology  by  computing  the  system 
metrics  for  a  given  architecture.  This  allows  for  rapid  evaluat ions  and  comparisons  of 
alternat ive  architectures.   The  four  steps  in  the  development  of  the  TPF  modules  are  listed 
and explained below. 

1) Explore all possible options and perform preliminary  trade studies to  identify a candidate 
architecture for the subsystem. 
This  step  primarily  entails  background  research  into  each  subsystem.    First,  a  list  of  all  the 
candidate  architectures  for  a  subsystem  or  funct ion  is  made.    Next,  the  advantages  and 
disadvantages of each candidate architecture are defined.   If enough  informat ion  is known at 
this  po int,  a  design  decision  is  made  on  the  subsystem  architecture  (ex.  solar  power  vs. 
nuclear power). 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 46 of 175 

2) Develop the subsystem modules. 
Once  an  architecture  has  been  decided  on  for  a  given  subsystem,  the  module  for  that 
subsystem  may  be  developed.    This  includes  explic it ly  defining  inputs  required  by  the 
module,  the  outputs  the  module  will  deliver,  and  the  mathemat ical  relat ionships  between 
these  inputs  and  outputs.  Once  the  module  has  been  developed,  the  engineer  may  use  it  to 
explore  the  trade-space  of  the  subsystem  (ex.  How  does  solar  array  area  scale  with  orbital 
radius?).  The  importance of taking the time to understand  the trade-space of each subsystem 
cannot  be  overstressed.    For  if  the  relationships  between  the  inputs  and  outputs  of  each 
module  are  not  understood  before  the  modules  are  linked,  then  the  engineer  will  not 
understand  why  certain  architectures  perform  better  in  terms  of  the  system  metrics  than 
other  architectures.   By  understanding  the  trade-space  of  each  subsystem,  the  engineer  will 
be  better  prepared  to  make  intelligent  system  architecting  decisions  and  to  interpret  the 
results of any attempts to optimize a design.  This step also provides an opportunity to debug 
the module before linking  it with the other modules. 

3)  Code  the module  as  a Matlab  Function,  connect  it  to  the  other  modules,  and  analyze  an 
entire architecture at once. 
Once  the  subsystem module  has  been debugged,  it may  be  coded  up  as  a   Matlab  Funct ion. 
A  “m aster ” m -file  then  links  the modules  together.   The  outputs  from  each module  serve  as 
inputs  to  one  or more  successive  modules  to  size  the  system  architecture  and  evaluate  it  on 
the  basis  o f  the  system  metrics.   At  this  po int,  a  simu lation  tool  has  been  created.   For  any 
given set of architectural inputs, the Matlab  “ master ” m -file will use  the modules  to size and 
evaluate  that  architecture.  The  results  from  different  simulations  may  then  be  used  to 
compare different architectures. 

4)  Apply  an  algorithm  to  systematically  explore  the  system  trade-space  and  search  for 
“optimal” des
igns on the basis of a given metric. 
This  final  step  is  optional.    The  design  team  may  decide  to  use  the  simulat ion  tool  to 
compare  a  small  number  of  different  architectures.   If,  however,  the  design  team  deems  it 
necessary  to  evaluate  a  large number of different  architectures  rapidly,  then  an  optimizat ion 
algorithm may be applied to systemat ically explore the global trade-space. 

6.7  Module Integration 
The TPF design process was divided  into six macro-modules: 
•  Environment 
•  Aperture Configurat ion 
•  Spacecraft 
•  Dynamics, Control, & Structure 
•  Deployment & Operations 
•  Systems Analys is - GINA 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 47 of 175 

Certain macro-modules were further subdivided  into sub-modules.   This modular divis ion of 
the  TPF  design  process  reduces  software  development  risk  by  reducing  coupling  and 
simplifies the simulat ion code development as each module  is separately testable. 

An  N2  diagram  is  an  N  x  N  matrix  used  by  systems  engineers  to  develop  and  organize 
interface  information (Boppe, 1998).  The sub-modules (Matlab m-file functions) are  located 
along the diagonal of the matrix.   The  inputs to each sub-module are vert ical and  the outputs 
are horizontal.   The aggregation of  the sub-modules  into macro-modules  is  illustrated  by the 
black boxes enveloping different sections of the diagonal. 

The  N2  diagram  in  Figure  14  provides  a  visual  representation  of  the  flow  of  informat ion 
through  the  conceptual  design  process  and  will  be  used  to  connect  all  of  the  Mat lab 
funct ions to enable an automated simulation o f different TPF architectures.

7.0  Architectural Design Evaluation Modules
The  fo llowing  sect ions  discuss  how  the  Matlab  modules  have  been  designed  to  perform
comparisons  of  competing  TPF  mission  architectures.    Details  regarding  the  intent,  design,
and trade space for each module are provided.

7.1  Environment Macro-Module
Module Motivation:
The  local  space  environment  will  influence  the  thermal,  power,  aperture  size,  mission
lifet ime,  and  spacecraft  attitude  control  components  of  the  spacecraft  and  must  be
considered  when  evaluat ing  if  the  proposed  design  meets  the  TPF  mission  requirements.
The  so lar  flux  at  the operational orbit  is one of  the major  issues  for  thermal  control  and  is  a
potential  source  of  power.    Therefore,  the  solar  flux  information  will  be  calculated  by  this
module  and will  be used  as  an  input  to  the  thermal  and  power modules.    The  local  zodiacal
environment  influences  aperture  size.    The  aperture  size  must  be  larger  to  detect  a  planet
through thicker  local zodiacal dust. The calculated local zodiacal  information will be used as
an  input  to  the  payload  module  in  order  to  calculate  the  minimum  required  aperture  size.
Micrometeoroid  impacts  can  cause  physical  or  plasma-related  damage  to  the  payload  and
the bus.  Most damage  to the TPF will be  the result of cumulative degradation of  the mirrors
and  other  structures  from  micrometeoroid  impacts  over  a  long  period  of  time.    The
calculated  meteoroid  flux  will  be  input  to  the  payload  module  to  permit  calculation  o f
shielding parameters  and  to  the GINA  module  to  help  estimate  end  of  mission  performance
and  failure rates.  The solar pressure and gravity gradient data output by  this module will  be
used  by  the  ADCS  module.    When  the  TPF  is  close  to  the  Sun,  the  effects  of  these  two
outputs may be significant.

Module Description:
The so lar flux as a function of so lar orbit radius  is calculated using Equation 1, which shows
that  the  solar  flux  varies  as  the  inverse  square  of  the  distance  from  the  Sun.    The  solar  flux
informat ion  is  used  as  an  input  to  the  thermal  and  power  modules  to  calculate  the  sizes  of
thermal  shielding  and  of  so lar  arrays.    Figure  15  is  a  plot  of  this  funct ion  for  the  orbital
range under consideration for the TPF mission.

Zodiacal  dust  is  composed  of  very  tiny  part icles  ever  present  in  our  own  and  other  solar
systems.    These  particles  are  remnants  of  the  construction  of  the  planets  and  of  co llisions
among  comets,  asteroids,  and  other  small  bodies.    The  local  zodiacal  dust  is  the  dust  in  our
own solar system and the exo-zodiacal dust is  the dust around candidate stars.  Zodiacal dust
creates  a diffuse glow  at  infrared wavelengths  that makes  it more  difficult  to  detect  planets.
Due  to  the gravitational  attraction of  the Sun, more dust  exists near  the Sun.    Therefore,  the
TPF  will  experience  different  levels  of  local  zodiacal  dust  depending  on  the  orbit.    On  the
other  hand,  the  level  of  exo-zodiacal  dust  has  litt le  or  no  dependence  on  the  TPF  orbit.
According  to  the  TPF  Book,  the  exo-zodiacal  dust  emission  is  expected  to  be  smooth,  with
less  than 1%  random variat ions,  except  for  rings  and wakes due  to gravitational  trapping  by
planets  or  bands  due  to  recent  asteroid  or  comet  collis ions.    As  a  result,  the  Environment
Module  provides  the  information  on  the  local  zodiacal  dust  only  as  function  o f  the  TPF
orbit.

The  local  zodiacal  intensity  informat ion generated  from  the Environment Module  is  used  to
calculate  the  signal  to  noise  ratio  which  will  determine  the  minimum  aperture  size.    The
fo llowing  equat ions  are  used  to  calculate  the  local  zodiacal  intensity,  which  is  ploted  in
Figure 16 for the orbital range under considerat ion for the TPF mission.

The meteoroid flux can be calculated  in terms of the cumulat ive flux, which  is the number of
particles  per  m2  per  year  for  a  mass  greater  than  or  equal  to  that  mass,  against  a  randomly
tumbling  surface.    The  interplanetary  flux  at  1  AU  is  described  by  Equat ion  6  for  masses
less than 10 g. A focusing  factor (Equation 7)  that accounts for the gravitational  influence of
the  Sun  on  meteoroid  density  must  be  applied  to  Equation  6  to  estimate  the  flux  for  other
orbits. The cumulat ive meteoroid flux at 1 AU  is plotted in Figure 17.

In  orbit,  the  TPF  will  experience  gravity  gradient  torques  due  to  the  distribut ion  of  mass
along  (among)  the  spacecraft  and  the  distances  of  those  masses  from  the  center  of  mass  of

Trade Space:
The  outputs  from  this  module  contribute  to  the  trade  between  so lar  and  nuclear  power  and
provide  inputs  for the determinat ion of aperture size,  thermal and debris protection schemes,
mission  lifet ime,  and ADCS  capabilit ies.    All  of  these  factors  are  evaluated  as  funct ions  of
the chosen operational orbit for the TPF mission.

7.2  Aperture Configuration Macro-Module
Module Motivation:
As discussed  in  sect ion 5.1  above,  the TPF mission will  be  implemented  using  a  number  of
sparse  apertures  operating  as  an  interferometer.    Unlike  conventional  interferometers,  the
goal  of  this  mission  is  to  null  out  the  parent  star.    This  will  be  done  using  the  Bracewell
nulling  interferometer  concept.    However,  similar  to  any  convent ional  interferometer,  the
response  of  the  TPF  interferometer  will  be  highly  dependent  upon  the  locations  and  the
relat ive sizes of  the  individual apertures.   This module will ensure  that the evaluated designs
meet the TPF mission’s star light nulling requirement.

Module Description:
The goal of  the Aperture Configuration Module  is  to  capture  the  effects  of  the  environment
surrounding  the  planetary  system  of  interest.    Taking  into  account  all  the  possible  external
no ise  sources  that  can  effect  the  capability  o f  the  interferometer  to  detect  a  planet,  the
optimal  transmissivity  funct ion  for  the  given  number  of  apertures  in  the  interferometer  is
then determined.

The  inputs  to  this  module  come  direct ly  from  the  Design  Vector.   Specifically,  the  module 
must  be provided with  the  type  of  interferometer,  the  number  of  apertures  to  be  used  in  the 
interferometer  design,  and  the  size  of  the  apertures.  The  types  of  interferometers  can  be 
divided  into  the  four  types  listed  in  Table  1.    Note  that  this  module  does  not  dist inguish 
between  Structurally  Connected  (SCI)  or  Separated  Spacecraft  (SSI)  architectures.  Linear 
configurations  limit  the  placement  of  apertures  to  a  single  line.  Two  dimensional 
configurations  arrange  the  apertures  in  a plane  normal  to  the pointing  direction.  Symmetric 
configurations  require  an  even  number  of  apertures  and  that  each  pair  of  apertures  is  the 
same  size  and  is  located  symmetrically  about  the  center  of  the  array.    The  number  of 
apertures  in  the  array  can  be  between  four  and  twelve,  subject  to  the  limitat ion  that 
symmetric  configurat ions  must  have  an  even  number.    The  range  of  aperture  diameters  is 
between 0.5 meters and 4.0 meters.  When the size o f the apertures is specified, it  is assumed 
that  all  the  apertures  will  have  the  same  size.    However,  when  the  aperture  size  is  left  as  a 
free  parameter,  an  optimization  routine  is  used  to  choose  the  optimum  individual  aperture 
sizes. These  inputs are summarized  in Table 1.

For  each  set  of  inputs,  this  module  produces  a  single  N  by  6  output  matrix,  where  N  is  the 
number  of apertures  in  the  design.   An  example  of  the  module  output  is  shown  in  Table  2. 
The  first  column  in  the  matrix  lists  the  number  of  apertures  in  the  design.    The  locat ions  of 
the  apertures  are  then  given  in  co lumns  two  and  three,  in  po lar  coordinates.  The  sizes  of 
these  apertures  are  given  in  column  four.    Column  five  shows  the  phasing  angles  that  must 
be provided  to the reflected  light beam from  the apertures before being  combined  to  provide 
the required nulling depth and width.  In general,  these phasing  angles  are  chosen  arbitrarily 
but  can  also  be  set  as  a  free  parameter  in  the  optimizat ion  routine.    The  last  column  in  the 
output  shows  the  length of delay  lines  required  to  ensure  that  the  same  wavefront  from  the 
target  is  interfered  when  no  phasing  angles  are  introduced.   The  values  in  this  co lumn  are 
generated  by  subtracting  each  value  in  the  second  column  from  the  aperture  that  is  furthest 
away from the center of the array.

The  optimal  aperture  configurat ions  obtained  from  this  module  were  determined  prior  to
running  the  integrated  software.    The  different  possible  interferometer  types  were  first
ident ified  and  separate  routines  were  used  to  determine  their  optimal  configurat ions.    The
mechanics  behind  this  optimization  are  described  below  fo llowing  a  brief  summary  o f  the
concept and the fundamental equat ions of a nulling  interferometer.

The  concept of using  a  nulling  interferometer  to  detect  an  Earth-like  planet  by  reducing  the
glare  from  its  parent  star, was  first  proposed  by  Bracewell  and MacPhie  (1979).   Their  two
aperture concept is essent ially similar to the Michelson  interferometer except for  introducing
a  180(cid:176)  phase  shift  to  one  of  the  two  light  beams  before  they  are  interfered  at  the  combiner.
This,  in  essence,  creates  a  zero  response  at  the  center  of  the  interferometer’s  fringe  pattern.
However,  it  is  possible  to  null  out  the  parent  star  using  more  than  two  apertures.    The  first
interferometer that was proposed for the TPF mission actually has  four apertures (Angel and
Woolf 1997) arranged  in a  linear array.  This  interferometer is better known as OASES.   The
first  two-dimensional  aperture  configurat ion  using  five  apertures  was  proposed  by
Mennesson  and  Mariotti  (1997)  for  the  Darwin  project.    Essent ially,  given  the  locat ions  of
the  apertures  and  the  amount  of  phase  shift  to  be  introduced  into  each  co llector  beam,  the
response of the  interferometer is given by Equat ion 10.

Note that the form of the transmissivity funct ion  in Equation 10  is essent ially the same as  for
an  ordinary  Michelson  interferometer,  except  for  the  independent  phase  shift  term.    By
expanding  the cosine  term  in  the equat ion, one  can quickly  recognize  that  the  Lk  cos(dk)  and
Lk  sin(dk)  are  actually  the  x  and  y  coordinates  of  aperture  k.    As  in  an  ordinary
interferometer,  it  is  the  relat ive  posit ion  between  the  apertures  that  is  of  importance,  not
their abso lute coordinates.

The  transmissivity  funct ion  for  the OASES  interferometer design operating  at 12 microns  is
plotted  in  Figure  18.    This  interferometer  consists  of  four  apertures  arranged  in  a  1-2-2-1
configuration.    The  1-2-2-1  interferometer  notation  is  interpreted  as  having  two  1  meter
apertures  located  at  the  extreme  ends  of  the  interferometer  and  two  2  meter  apertures
between them.  The distance between each aperture,  in  this case,  is  the same  throughout.   By
introducing  a phase  shift of  180o  to one  aperture  in  each  of  the  two  pairs,  the  transmissivity
funct ion  in Equation 10 can  be reduced  to Equation 11.   A value of B = 75 meters was  used
in Equat ion 12 to generate Figure 18.

Equation 11

Since  the OASES array  is actually  linear and symmetric,  the response  shown  in Figure 18  is
only  for  the  f =  0o  sky  angle.    Clearly  seen  in  the  figure  is  the  very  low  response  of  the
interferometer for small angular separat ions about the origin (r = 0o).   From  the  figure, at r =
7.5 x 10-4  arcsec,  the normalized  response o f  the  interferometer  is only  2.8  x  10-10, which  is
very  small  compared  to  some  of  the  responses  for  angular  separations  that  are  greater  than
0.1 arcsec.  In fact, the response shown here actually meets  the nulling requirement to detect
an  Earth-like  planet  orbit ing  a  Sun-like  star  located  10  parsecs  away.    The  aperture
configurations determined  in  this module are optimized  for an observat ion wavelength of 12
microns  and  a  target  distance  of  10  parsecs.  The  six  order  of  magnitude  star  light
suppression that is required  is  indicated by  the so lid red box  in  the  figure. The dashed  line  in
the figure represents an area between  the surface of  the parent star to the 0.5 AU  inside  limit
of  the  habitable  zone.    Signals  received  from  this  area  will  be  pre-dominant ly  from  the
zodiacal  cloud  surrounding  the  star.    Therefore,  it  makes  sense  to  also  null  out  this  region.
Unfortunately,  it  is almost  impossible  to null out such  a  large  region using  a  limited  number
of apertures and maintaining  the  desired high  transmissivity  in  the  habitable  region.   Hence,
the  dashed  lines  represent  a  soft  constraint where  it  is  preferable  to  have  the  interferometer
exhibit a  low transmissivity, but it  is not a  “hard” requirement.

Figure 18. OASES Transmissivity Function Along f= 0(cid:176)

For  the optimizat ion  process,  the  ideal  transmissivity  function  is  defined  using  the  hard  and
soft constraints shown  in  Figure  18  together with  the desired unity  response  in  the  habitable
range.   A  simple  object ive  funct ion  is  formed by  taking  the  absolute  difference  between  the
ideal  transmissivity  function and  the  response  generated  by  the  interferometer.   However,  in
order  to  ensure  that  the  transmissivity  response  obtained  from  the  optimization  actually
meets  the  nulling  requirement,  several  modificat ions  were  made  to  the  object ive  function.
Since  the  transmissivity  funct ion  deals  with  relat ively  small  values,  the  algorithm  uses  the
logarithmic difference between  the  transmissivity  functions  instead of  the  simple  difference.
For  the  low  transmissivity  constraints,  the  configurat ion  will  be  penalized  if  the
transmissivity  lies above these constraints  in the vio lat ion region.  To ensure that the optimal
solut ion  does  not  vio late  the  hard  constraint,  the  logarithmic  difference  between  the
transmissivity  funct ions  is  mult iplied  by  a  large  coefficient  (10,000).    Hence,  the  object ive
funct ion of this optimizat ion problem  is defined by Equation 13.

Equation 13

Due  to  time  constraints,  the  aperture  configurations  in  this  project  were  optimized  for
imaging  an  Earth-Sun  system  located  10  parsecs  away.    This  value  was  chosen  because  it
lies  half way  between  the  5  and  15  parsecs  where  the  different  planetary  systems  are  to  be
observed  with  the  TPF  interferometer.    The  observat ional  wavelength  chosen  for  this
optimizat ion,  12  microns,  was  also  chosen  because  it  lies  halfway  between  the  7  and  17
micron  band  that  TPF  will  be  observing.    Hence,  the  only  variables  left  to  determine  in
Equation  10  are  the  physical  properties  of  the  apertures  and  their  phasing  angles.    To
simplify  the  optimization,  the  phasing  angles  of  the  apertures  are  calculated  using  Equation
14.

Equation 14

Except  for  N  =  2,  these  sets  of  phasing  angles  allow  the  interferometer  to  achieve  a  zero
response  in  its  transmissivity  funct ion  to  within  first  order.    This  can  be  verified  by  taking
the  summat ion  of  the  complex  exponent ials  of  all  the  phasing  angles.    For  a  more  detailed
discussion of this matter, the reader is referred to Mennesson and Mariotti (1997).

The  only  variables  that  are  left  to  consider  in  the  optimizat ion  process  are  the  physical
properties of  the apertures, namely  their  locations and sizes.   The possible aperture  locations
chosen  for this problem are mapped onto a circular grid with a minimum  radius of  5 meters,
a  maximum  radius  of  60  meters,  and  a  minimum  radial  separat ion  of  5  meters  between
locat ions.  The angular separat ion between the  imaging  locat ions  is  fixed at 10(cid:176), which gives
a total of 432 possible  imaging  locations.

For the aperture diameter, the minimum  allowable  aperture  size  is 0.5 meters,  the maximum
is 4 meters, and the  increment between aperture sizes  is 0.5 meters.   The maximum diameter
is  a  consequence  of  the  limitat ion  imposed  by  the  circumferences  of  currently  available
launch  vehicles.    In  this  project,  the  possibility  o f  using  deployable  apertures  was  not
considered.

The global optimum  for this optimizat ion problem can only be determined  if  all  the  possible
solut ions are considered, or  if  the optimizat ion space  is proven  to be convex.   Given  the 432
possible  imaging  locat ions  and N  apertures,  the  number  of  possible  aperture  configurat ions
is 432!/(432-N)!, which can be approximated as 432N.   Assuming  that  it  takes approximately
1  ms  of  computational  t ime  to  consider  each  possible  configuration,  the  time  required  to
consider  all  the possible  combinat ions  for N =  4  is  404  days!   Hence,  from  a  computational
standpoint, it is  impract ical to try to search the entire optimization space.

In  this  module,  a  heuristic  optimizat ion  method,  namely  simulated  annealing,  is  used  to
determine  the  best  aperture  configurat ions.    The  use  of  heurist ic  methods  cannot  guarantee
that the solut ion obtained  is  the global minimum, but  in general, offers a reasonable so lut ion
requiring short computational  time.   Due  to the  limited  t ime allocated to this project,  the use
of  heurist ics  can  be  just ified  in  that  the  goal  is  to  first  obtain  a  feasible  so lut ion  (one  that
doesn’t vio late the hard constraint) and then to improve the solut ion by further  iteration.

The  basic  premise  behind  the  simulated  annealing  technique  can  be  found  in  Kirkpatrick,
Gelatt  and  Vecchi  (1983).    Applicat ions  of  this  method  in  the  determinat ion  of  optimal
aperture  configurat ions  can  be  found  in  both  Cornwell  1988  and  Kong  1998,  which  are
similar  to  what  is  being  done  in  this  case.    Essent ially,  this  optimizat ion  method  uses  a
statist ical  approach  by  starting with  a  randomly  selected  configurat ion  of  aperture  locations
and aperture diameters.   A  new  configuration  is  then  chosen  randomly  by  either  swapping  a
point that  is already  in  the set of  imaging po ints with a new point  chosen  randomly  from  the
total  available  set  of  imaging  locat ions,  or  by  randomly  changing  the  size  of  a  particular

aperture.  This new configurat ion is then compared with the current  best  configurat ion and  is 
accepted  as  the new  current best  if  its object ive  funct ion  is  the  lower of  the  two.  However, 
the  current  best  configurat ion  can  st ill  be  replaced  by  a  higher  object ive  function 
configuration  if  this configurat ion has an e(- /T) value  that  is greater  than a number  randomly 
drawn  between  0  and  1, where 
is  the  difference  in  object ive  funct ion  values  between  the 
configurations.  The  variable  T  is  called  the  "temperature"  of  the  system  and  is  decreased 
each  time  a  new  configuration  is  accepted.  This  ensures  that  for  a  system  that  is  at  a  low 
temperature,  the probability o f  accept ing  a  configuration with  a  higher  object ive  function  is 
low.    The  key  feature  in  this  optimization  technique  is  that  it  reduces  the  chance  that  the 
system will get stuck at a local minimum solut ion. 

The  starting  temperature  chosen  for  this  optimization  algorithm  is  T  =  10,000.
  The 
temperature is reduced by mult iplying by the temperature mult iplicat ion factor g = 0.99 each 
time  a  new  configuration  is  accepted.  The  temperature  mult iplicat ion  factor  must  be  set 
such that  the temperature  is  reduced  in  small  enough  steps  to prevent  convergence  to  a non-
optimal, or  "quench," solut ion.  The  temperature  is  also  reduced  in  the  same manner when  a 
particular configuration does not get replaced after 7,500  addit ional trials.  The  optimizat ion 
process  is  completed  when  a  configurat ion  becomes  “ frozen, ”   which  means  that  it  has  had 
its  temperature  reduced  three  times  without  being  replaced  by  another  configurat ion.  A 
flow chart of this optimizat ion strategy is shown in Figure 19. 

Figure 19. Simulated Annealing Flow Chart (Kong, 1998) 

The  optimizat ion  algorithm  in  this  module  does  not  distinguish  between  the  two  types  of 
interferometer (SCI or SSI) considered  in this study.  Rather, constraints are used  to  limit  the 
total  number  of  possible  configurations.    The  two  classes  of  configurat ions  considered  in 
this  study  are  the  linear  and  the  two-dimensional  configurat ions.    For  each  of  these 
configurations,  the  apertures  may  or  may  not  be  constrained  to  be  placed  symmetrically 
about  the  center  of  the  array.    Furthermore,  only  one  optimizat ion  is  required  for  a  given 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 60 of 175 

ratio  of  aperture  sizes,  since  the  actual  aperture  sizes  effect  only  the  required  integration 
time  and  not  the  characterist ics  of  the  normalized  transmissivity  funct ion.    The  integration 
time effects are handled by the GINA macro-module. 

An  addit ional  constraint  on  the  placement  of  apertures  is  imposed  by  the  desire  to  avoid 
collisions between  spacecraft  in  the SSI  case.  A minimum  separation  o f  10 meters  between 
the  centers  of  the  apertures  is  imposed  to  ensure  that  none  of  the  apertures  overlap.  Since 
this  module  does  not  different iate  between  SSI  and  SCI  configurat ions,  this  10  meter 
minimum separation constraint will be applied to all configurations. 

The module outputs for the different aperture configurat ions are tabulated in Appendix B. 

Trade Space: 
By defining  the  required  baseline  length,  relative  aperture placement,  and  in  some  cases  the 
aperture diameters, the aperture configurat ion module plays a significant role  in defining  the 
image  integrity  and  the  total  size  and  mass  of  the  TPF  spacecraft.  All  o f  these  factors 
contribute to the cost per image metric that is used to compare configurat ions. 

7.3  Spacecraft Macro-Module 
The  Spacecraft  Macro-Module  consists  of  the  five  modules  that  represent  the  science 
payload  instruments  and  the  spacecraft  bus  subsystems  that  support  payload  operations. 
Namely,  the  five  modules  are  the  Payload,  Communicat ions,  Power,  Propulsion,  and 
Thermal modules.  The Spacecraft Macro-Module  is  responsible  for  scaling  the  relat ive  size 
and power characteristics of the  four bus subsystems to optimize the TPF spacecraft design. 

The  Spacecraft  Macro-Module  reads  in  inputs  from  the  Design  Vector  and  from  the 
Aperture  Configurat ion  and  Environment  Modules.    Using  these  inputs  the  bus  module 
estimates  the structural mass and  imaging  integration  t ime, sizes  the payload, and minimizes 
the  total  bus  mass  by  varying  the  peak  and  average  power  allocated  to  the  bus  subsystems. 
Figure 20 depicts  the data flow of  the module.   The precise data flow  into and out-of the bus 
module  is  inherent ly complicated and  is described in more detail in the sub-module sect ions.

There  is  a  fundamental mass  trade between  the power  system  and  the other bus  subsystems. 
To minimize mass,  the power subsystem always wants to have  a  minimum power, while  the 
other  subsystems  want  more  power  to  drive  their  respect ive  masses  down.    The  bus 
algorithm  iterates  through  a  reasonable  power  range  to  find  the  equilibrium  po int  between 
these  compet ing  goals.    For  each  peak  power,  there  are  several  different  average  power 
configurations.    The  bus  module  iterates  through  a  process  of  allocat ing  average  power  to 
each subsystem and keeps track of the result ing mass calculat ions  in a matrix. 

The minimum  bus mass  configurat ion  is  returned  to  the  general TMAS  routine.    In order  to 
satisfy the DOCS module finite element module, the point masses of  the subsystems are also 
provided.  Future versions of the bus module should  include  the DOCS and  the ADCS  in the 
bus optimizat ion because a  low mass system may not be  the best performing system.   Future 
versions  should  also  consider  a  simplificat ion  of  the  optimizat ion  algorithm.    Current ly,  the 
bus completely maps  the ent ire power trade space, which  takes a significant amount of  time, 
especially for the mult iple bus design of a separated spacecraft (SSI) mission.

7.3.1  Payload Module 
Module Motivation: 
In any  space mission,  the payload drives  the  system design  for  the  entire  spacecraft because 
the  payload  components  gather,  process,  and  transmit  the  informat ion  needed  by  the  end 
user  to  fulfill  the mission  object ives.    The  remaining  spacecraft  subsystems  exist  to  support 
the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  payload.    Therefore,  it  is  important  to  first  define  the 
payload requirements so  they can be accounted for  in  the overall system design.    In  the  case 
of  the  TPF  mission,  the  goal  is  to  direct ly  detect  planets  around  parent  stars  within  fifteen 
parsecs.
  Addit ionally,  the  TPF  spacecraft  must  be  able  to  image  a  wide  range  of 
astrophysical  sources.  To  meet  these  goals,  the  TPF  spacecraft  will  be  an  interferometer 
designed  to  observe  in  the  mid-infrared  spectrum with  a  tunable  baseline  [Beichman  et.  al., 
1999].   This  will  allow  the  spacecraft  to  successfully  image  a  planet  with  milliarcsecond 
angular  reso lution  while  nulling  the  light  from  the  parent  star.  Also,  the  interferometer 
baseline  can  be  expanded  to  permit  precise  imaging  of  astrophysical  sources.  To  support 
this  mission,  the  TPF  payload  must  be  able  to  collect  science  light  from  a  target  source, 
convert  it  to  a  useful  image/spectrum,  and  store  it  for  later  transmission  to  Earth  for 
scientific use. 

The  payload  components  required  for  TPF  fall  into  four  main  categories:  the  collector 
mirrors,  the  optical  train,  the  beam  combiner,  and  the  infrared  detectors.  The  collector 
mirrors  and  a  portion  of  the  optical  train  (fast  steering  mirrors  and  beam  co llimators)  are 
located  on  the  collector  spacecraft,  where  science  light  from  the  target  source  is  co llected 
and  fed  to  the  combiner.    The  remainder  of  the  optical  train  (delay  lines),  the  beam 
combiner,  and  the  IR  instruments  are  found  on  the  combiner  spacecraft,  where  the  science 
light  is  combined  to  synthesize  either  an  image  or  a  spectrum  [Beichman  et.  al.,  1999, 
Chapter  11].  The TPF payload  places  many  requirements  on  bus  subsystems  to  ensure  that 
it  performs  as  designed.    First,  the  power  subsystem  must  meet  the  power  demand  of  the 
payload  to  ensure  its  proper  function.    Also,  successful  combinat ion  of  the  different  beams 
of  light  from  the  co llectors  requires  that  the  ADCS,  GNC,  and  propulsion  subsystems 
precisely  control  the  relative  posit ions  of  the  spacecraft  as  well  as  cont inuously  provide  a 
high  level o f disturbance  reject ion during  an  imaging  session.  The  thermal  subsystem must 
use a combinat ion of cryocoolers and sunshields to cool the payload components to the point 
where  their  sensit ivity  is  maximized.  Finally,  the  communications  subsystem  must  be  able 
to 
successfully 
transmit 
stored 
images 
back 
to 
Earth. 

The  main  function  of  the  payload  module  is  to  provide  mass  and  power  demand  est imates 
for  the  various  payload  components.
  These  values  impact  the  power  and  propulsion 
modules within the Spacecraft Macro-Module  as well  as  the  spacecraft  structural model  and 
disturbance  analys is  in  the  DOCS  Macro-Module.  Also,  the  thermal  and  communications 
demands  for  the  payload  are  direct ly  specified  in  each  of  these  modules.    In  addit ion  to  the 
payload  properties,  this  module  uses  mass  and  power  estimates  for  the  Command  and  Data 
Handling (C&DH) and  the Attitude Determinat ion and Control (ADCS) subsystems because 
masses  and  power  demands  of  these  subsystems  are  relatively  independent  of  the  overall 
TPF design.

Module Description: 
In general,  the  TPF  payload  module  is  relat ively  straight  forward  because  most  of  the  mass 
and power demand  estimates  for  the payload  components  and  for  the  C&DH  subsystem  are 
based on the  estimates made  by  the  Jet  Propulsion  Laboratory  (JPL)  in  their  analysis  o f  the 
TPF  mission  [Beichman  et.  al.,  1999].   The  inputs  to  this  module  are  the  diameters  of  the 
collector mirrors and the type o f interferometer used.  The module conso lidates  the mass and 
power  demand  est imates  for  the  payload  components  as  well  as  for  the  C&DH  and  ADCS 
subsystems  and  outputs  this  information  in  vector  form  to  give  the  mass  and  power 
distribut ion  for  each  TPF  spacecraft.  The  payload  module  is  integrated  with  the  spacecraft 
bus  modules  to  create  the  Spacecraft  Macro-Module  that  opt imizes  the  allocat ion  of  mass 
and power to the bus subsystems. 

The  init ial  task  of  the  payload  module  is  to  provide  the  mass  and  power  demand  est imates 
for  the  C&DH  and  the  ADCS  subsystems.    These  subsystem  est imates  are  placed  in  the 
payload  module  because  it  is  assumed  that  their  values  are  fixed  with  respect  to  the 
spacecraft architecture.  The C&DH subsystem is responsible  for processing and distribut ing 
spacecraft  commands as well as monitoring  the hea lth  and  status of  the  spacecraft  [Wertz & 
Larson,  1992].  The  mass  and  power  distribution  for  this  subsystem  was  based  on  the 
estimates  determined  by  JPL  for  an  SSI  architecture  [Beichman  et.  al.,  1999].  The  ADCS 
subsystem  provides  determinat ion  and  control  of  attitude  and  orbit  posit ion  [Wertz  & 
Larson,  1992].    In  this  case,  the  mass  and  power  demand  est imates  came  from  the  ADCS 
module.    Table  3  and  Table  4  specify  the  mass  and  power  demand  est imates,  based  on 
architecture type, used  in the payload module for the C&DH and ADCS subsystems.

Certain  assumptions  concerning  the  est imates  in  Table  3  and  Table  4  need  to  be  addressed. 
First,  there  are  different  approaches  used  to  assess  the  impact  of  architecture  type  (SSI  or 
SCI) on the mass and power demand est imates for these subsystems.  The estimates made  by 
JPL  for  the  C&DH  subsystem  were  based  on  an  SSI  architecture  were  each  spacecraft 
requires  its  own  bus  subsystems,  including  a  C&DH  computer.    However,  an  SCI 
architecture  needs  only  one  C&DH  computer  because  the  spacecraft  bus  can  be  centrally 
located on the bus.   This  single C&DH  computer  for  the  ent ire  spacecraft  will  require  more 
mass and power than  the combiner spacecraft est imate  for the SSI architecture, but  less  than 
the  combined  total  for  all  SSI  spacecraft.    Consequent ly,  the  mass  and  power  demand 
estimates  for  the  C&DH  subsystem  in  an  SCI  architecture  are  the  sum  of  the  estimates  for 
the combiner and a single collector.   On the other hand,  the mass  and power distribut ion  for 
the  ADCS  subsystem  was  assumed  to  be  independent  of  interferometer  type  because  the 
collectors  and  the  combiner  require  a  control  system  regardless  of  spacecraft  architecture. 
This  assumpt ion  is  valid  for  the  most  cases,  but  there  probably  are  some  funct ions  of  this 
subsystem  that  could  be  centralized  in  an  SCI  architecture,  which  would  reduce  the  overall 
mass and power demand of the ADCS subsystem. 

Another  assumpt ion  is  that  the  number  of  apertures  and  the  aperture  diameter  have  a 
negligible  impact  on  the  masses  and  power  demands  of  the  C&DH  and  ADCS  subsystems. 
While  such  an  assumpt ion  is  generally  valid  for  init ial  est imates,  further  analys is  of  the 
C&DH  and  ADCS  subsystems  are  expected  to  show  increases  in  their  mass  and  power 
demands when  the  number  of  apertures  of  the  aperture  diameter  is  increased.    For  instance, 
these  subsystems  should  require  more  mass  and  power  when  they  must  maintain  control 
over eight  instead of four apertures or when  they need  to maneuver collector spacecraft  with 
four-meter diameter mirrors instead of two.  Further  revisions of  the payload module  should 
account  for  all  elements  of  the  design  vector  when  est imat ing  the  masses  and  power 
demands  of  the  C&DH  and  ADCS  subsystems,  but  the  est imates  currently  used  are  good 
first-order approximat ions  for this analys is. 

With  the  mass  and  power  demand  est imates  for  the  C&DH  and  ADCS  subsystems  known, 
the  last  task  of  the  payload  module  is  to  make  the  same  est imates  for  the  different 
components  of  the  payload.    The  estimates,  listed  in  Table  5,  are  separated  based  on  the 
payload  distr ibution  between  the  collector  and  combiner  spacecraft    [Beichman  et.  al., 
1999].

✝ - The average power demand for the collector mirror is included with the collector optical train 

Most  of  these  est imates  are  taken  direct ly  from  JPL,  but  there  are  a  few  important 
differences.   First,  the  mass  of  the  collector  mirror  is  est imated  by  mult iplying  the  area  of 
the  mirror  with  the  approximate  areal  density  of  the  material  used  to  construct  it  [TPF 
Techno logy  Inheritance  Matrix,  1999].  Also,  the  estimates  for  the  combiner  optical  train 
were decreased because  the JPL est imate  includes cryocooler mass  and  power requirements, 
whereas  the  Spacecraft  Macro-Module  separates  the  thermal  control  devices  from  the 
components  of  the  payload.    Finally,  the  estimates  for  the  data  storage  computer  are  based 
on  rough  mass  and  power  demand  approximat ions  for  twenty  gigabytes  o f  storage  space 
[TPF Techno logy Inheritance Matrix, 1999]. 

The  mass  and  power  demand  est imates  for  the  TPF  payload  include  many  assumpt ions 
concerning  the  techno logy  available  in  the  next  decade  and  the  properties  of  the  payload 
components.  TPF  will  incorporate  a  wide  range  o f  advanced  techno logy  including 
lightweight  mirrors,  a 
laser  metrology  system,  a  beam  combiner,  an 
infrared 
detector/spectrometer,  and  other  techno logy  systems  that will  allow  TPF  to  interfere  beams 
of  light  with  accuracy  to  a  tiny  fract ion  of  a  wavelength.  Many  o f  these  technologies  are 
still  on  the  drawing  board  and  have  yet  to  be  demonstrated  or  tested  in  an  environment 
similar  to  TPF.   In  the  end,  the  actual  impact  of  the  techno logical  assumptions  on  the 
payload  est imates  will  not  be  known  for  some  time,  so  educated  guesses  based  on  past 
techno logy  but  adjusted  for  future  advances  must  be  used  for  the  time  being.    However, 
certain other  assumptions  can  be  relaxed  by  refining  the  mass  and  power  demand  est imates 
for  certain  payload  components.    For  example,  the  maximum  baseline  of  the  configurat ion 
and  the  required  delay  line  length  should  be  included  in  the  optical  train  est imates  for  the 
collectors and the combiner.  The collector optical  train may have  to be  changed  to  factor  in 
the  distance  that  the  beam  of  science  light  must  travel  to  get  to  the  combiner.    Also,  the 
combiner  optical  train  should  have  some  sort  of  dependence  on  delay  line  length  (kg/m) 
similar to the areal density of the co llector mirrors.  Another example concerns the  impact of 
the number  and  locat ion of  the  apertures on  the design of  the beam  combiner.    It ’ s  certainly 
reasonable  to conclude  that  the complexity o f  the beam combiner  increases with  the number 
of  apertures  because  it  must  be  able  to  interfere  a  greater  number  of  beams  of  light  to 
synthesize  the  final  image.    In  addit ion,  a  two-dimensional  configurat ions  require  a  more 
sophist icated beam combiner  than a  linear configuration.   The point  is  that  addit ional design 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 66 of 175 

parameters  need  to  be  included  in  the  mass  and  power  demand  est imates  for  the  TPF 
payload  components  so  that  a  better  understanding  can  be  gained  concerning  the  payload 
impact on the overall system design. 

Trade Space: 
Due to the fact that the TPF payload  is not well understood, there  is not a significant  level o f 
trade space  analys is  that  can  be  conducted  for  this module  at  this  time.   However,  the  mass 
and  power  distribut ion  for  the  payload  is  a  significant  contributor  to  the  mass/power  trade 
for  the  bus  subsystems  and  the  overall  spacecraft.    Although  the  payload  trade  space  is 
currently  quite  limited,  it  should  be  expanded  once  certain  techno logies  have  been 
demonstrated  and  the  actual  design  o f  the  payload  components  is  better  understood.  The 
techno logy assessment will validate some of  the  assumpt ions  concerning  the  payload  design 
but will also  point  out  certain  errors  and discrepancies  in  this design.   These  results must be 
used  to  correct  not  only  the  payload  design  but  also  the  overall  design  of  the  ent ire 
spacecraft. 
In  addit ion,  further  details  in  the  design  of  the  payload  components  will 
demonstrate how certain  top-level design considerations, such as  the  interferometer type and 
configuration,  number  of  apertures,  and maximum  baseline, will  affect  the  mass  and  power 
demand  est imates  of  the  payload.    As  the  TPF  payload  design  progresses,  the  payload 
module  can  be  expanded  to  include  the  impact  of  instrument  no ise  sources  on  the  overall 
signal-to-noise  ratio  of  the  system  as  well  as  a  reliability  analys is  of  each  individual 
component of the payload. 

7.3.2  Communications Module 
Module Motivation: 
The  communicat ions  system allows  the  transfer  of  TPF  data  to  the  science  community  and 
the  capability  o f  spacecraft  control  to  the  operations  team.    It  is  optimized  for  minimum 
mass. 

The  communicat ions  capability  of  the  TPF  consists  of  a  high  rate  data  transfer  system  and 
one  or more  low  rate  data  links.    Since  the  high  rate  system  is  most  affected  by  changes  in 
mission design parameters, the communicat ions module concentrates exclusively upon  it  for 
use  as  a  design  different iat ion  tool.    The  low  rate  systems  are  envis ioned  as  a  backup 
command  link  in  case  of  high  rate  failure,  will  operate  under  non-stressing  condit ions,  and 
can  be  safely  assumed  to  offer  negligible  changes  in  mass  and  required  power  throughout 
the  trade  space.  The  power  and  mass  of  the  inter-spacecraft  links  between  elements  of  a 
separated  spacecraft  interferometer,  while  addressed,  can  be  safely  neglected  due  to  their 
low size. 

Module Description: 
The  communicat ions  module  computes  the  size,  mass,  and  simple  configurat ion  of  the 
communicat ion system, while satisfying  the phys ical constraints of  the  link  equat ion.  There 
are  four  inputs  into  the module,  two of which (orbital  alt itude  and  power  allocation)  are  the 
main  system  drivers.    The  outputs  from  the  communications  module  are  the  antenna

diameter,  the  antenna  mass,  the  transmitter  mass,  and  the  minimum  gimbal  distance.    The
first  time  the  communicat ions  module  is  called  in  the  bus  macro  module,  it  provides  a
minimum  power  output.    Thereafter,  the  communications  module  takes  a  power  allocat ion
input  during  the  power  distribut ion  iteration  of  the  bus  macro  module.    The  inputs  and
outputs are shown  in Figure 21.

The  module  finds  the  minimum  antenna  size  and  mass  for  a  given  power,  data  rate,  and
orbital  alt itude.    This  is  accomplished  using  the  link  equat ion  and  Shannon’s  bound  for
error-free  transmission.    First,  the  physical  limit  of  the  signal  to  noise  ratio  is  found
according to the equation

is the signal to noise ratio, R is the data rate, and B  is the bandwidth.

This  constrains  the  intra-module  tradespace  and  o ffers  a  criterion  for  maximum  attainable
performance.   Then  the physical  limit  is raised  to a design  limit by  including  the  coding  loss
and  link  margin.    For  TPF,  the  system  is  power  limited,  not  bandwidth  limited,  so  highly
efficient  techniques  like  BPSK  Reed-Solomon  with  Viterbi  encoding  will  be  necessary  to
approach  the  Shannon  bound.    Coding  loss  values  were  taken  from  deep  space  missions  as
reference  (at  data  rates  less  than  100kbps),  and  can  be  assumed  applicable  for  higher  data
rates (~400kbps) with  the  improvement of  encoding due  to processor performance  increases
in  the  years  before  the  TPF  is  launched.    In  addit ion,  emerging  advances  in  amplifiers  will
lower  the  receiving  no ise  temperature  [Posner,  1988].    Results  from  the  link  equat ion  drive
the minimum antenna diameter.  This process  is shown by the fo llowing three equations:

This  equat ion  is  from  an  est imated  relat ionship  between  antenna  diameter,  gain,  and
frequency for a parabo lic shape given  in [Larson & Wertz, 1992].

The  link  design  assumes  use  of  NASA’s  70meter  DSN  for  the  ground  segment  and  its
associated 8.4GHz operational frequency.

The module calculates  the antenna mass by mult iplying  the  surface  antenna  area  by  the  area
density  o f  a  lightweight  mesh  material.    Typical  fiberglass/composite  options  are  heavier
and  experience  a  mass  penalty  due  to  deployment  mechanisms  if  the  diameter  exceeds  a
given payload  fairing size.   The mesh antenna  is always assumed  to be  launched  in a stowed
condit ion, with a small deployment mass penalty.

The  first  time  the  communicat ions  module  is  called,  it  must  provide  a  minimum  power  to
the  bus  macro  module.    In  reality,  there  is  no  power  constraint  in  this  determinat ion.
Theoretically,  any  low  power  level will work,  as  long  as  the  antenna  diameter  can  grow  as
large as possible.   Figure 22 shows  the relat ionship between power and antenna mass  for the
1  AU  separat ion  case.    Clearly,  there  exists  a  bend  in  the  curve  before  which  the  mass  is
prohibit ively  high,  and  after  which  the  additional  power  has  a  diminishing  effect.    The
module captures this  “bend  in the curve” and uses it as the  init ial minimum power estimate.

Figure 22.  Initial Power Estimate Determination for 1 AU Separation Case 

The TPF spacecraft, with  its  extremely  high  point ing  accuracy,  can  keep  the  radiated  signal 
on  its  earth  target well within  the half-power beamwidth with  a  body-fixed  antenna,  despite 
the  narrow  “ spot-beam”   nature  of  the  high  data  rate  downlink.    However,  communicat ions 
may be desired during spacecraft maneuvers, or at deliberate point ing offsets  for operational 
efficiency, so a required gimbal configuration is calculated. 

Laser  communicat ion  systems  have  not  been  incorporated  into  the  code  because  of  their 
inability to  penetrate  the  Earth’ s  atmosphere  sat isfactorily.   With  the  onset  of  earth-orbiting 
laser-to-RF  relay  satellites,  laser  communications  might  become  attractive,  but  using  a 
conservative  est imate  of  the  available  infrastructure  in  the  TPF  operational  timeframe,  RF 
communicat ions were  found  to  be  the  only  feasible  communicat ions  approach.    In  addit ion, 
only  a  simple  (yet  highly  effect ive)  parabo lic  antenna  configurat ion  was  used,  although 
some  alternat ive  techno logies  like  flat-plate  planar  arrays  could  provide  marginal  mass 
benefits. 

Trade Space: 
Figure 23 below shows  the effect  on antenna mass of variat ions  in distance  and data  rate  for 
a constant power level.

Figure 23.  Tradespace for Antenna Mass, Data Rate, and Distance 

As seen from the figure, the highest mass occurs when  the distance and data rate are highest. 
The  current  400  kbps  data  rate  is  specified  in  the  TPF  requirements,  but  should  that 
stipulat ion be relaxed  in  the  future, variat ions  in  the data rate would affect  the mass/distance 
relat ionship as shown. 

7.3.3  Power Module 
Module Motivation: 
The electrical power subsystem performs many funct ions  for the spacecraft  to ensure  that all 
subsystems  have  an  adequate  power  supply.  First,  it  condit ions  and  regulates  the  power 
supply  for  the  spacecraft.  Certain  bus  and  payload  components  may  require  different  or 
strict ly  regulated  input  voltage  levels.    Some  of  these  components  may  require  DC  power 
while others may need AC power.  The power subsystem must be able to provide  all of these 
subsystems  with  the  type  and  level  o f  power  they  need  to  operate  properly.    Second,  the 
power subsystem must store power for use during periods of peak power demand.   The peak 
power  requirements  drive  battery  select ion  to  ensure  and  adequate  power  storage  capability 
to  satisfy  the  peak  power  demands  for  the  ent ire  spacecraft.  Third,  the  power  subsystem 
must  distribute  power  throughout  the  spacecraft.  In  addit ion  to  these  primary  functions  of 
the power subsystem,  it must also perform secondary funct ions such as switching equipment 
on or off, protecting  against  short  circuits,  and  iso lat ing  faults  [Larson & Wertz, 1992].  All 
of these funct ions must be factored into the overall design of the spacecraft bus. 

The power module will choose a power source from among  the two main power sources that 
are  used  in  modern  spacecraft:  so lar  arrays  and  radio isotope  thermoelectric  generators 
(RTGs).  The  power  subsystem  design must  trade  between  the  two  power  sources  available 
to determine which one  is best suited to the specified TPF architecture. 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 71 of 175 

To design the power subsystem, certain design parameters for the ent ire spacecraft must  first 
be defined.   To begin with, the average and peak power demands  for all  the bus and payload 
subsystems need  to be known.  The average power requirement determines  the size and  type 
of  power  source  selected  while  the  peak  power  level  affects  the  size,  number,  and  type  of 
batteries  used  to  store  power  for  peak  power  periods.    Other  important  design  parameters 
that  impact  the  power  subsystem  include  the  mission  lifetime,  the  orbital  profile,  and  the 
spacecraft  configuration.  The  mission  lifet ime  defines  the  level  o f  redundancy  needed  to 
account for solar array degradat ion or the amount of fuel that is required to run an RTG for a 
specific  amount  of  time.    The  orbital  profile  specifies  the  radiat ion  environment  for  the 
spacecraft  (solar  flux,  eclipse  periods,  etc.).  Finally,  the  spacecraft  configurat ion  impacts 
the  physical  locat ion  and  dimensions  of  the  power  subsystem  [Larson  &  Wertz,  1992]. 
Once  all o f  these  design  parameters  have  been  considered,  the  detailed  design  of  the  power 
subsystem can take place. 

The  main  purpose  of  the  TPF  power  module  is  to  assess  the  different  design  options 
available  for  the  power  subsystem  and  to  select  the  one  that  is  best  suited  to  the  TPF 
spacecraft  design.    This  module  estimates  the  masses  of  the  various  components  of  the 
power  subsystem  including  the  power  source,  batteries,  and  miscellaneous  devices  such  as 
the power control unit and regulators/converters.   The power module  is  incorporated  into  the 
spacecraft  bus  and  payload  macro-module  which  determines  the  optimal  mass  and  power 
combinat ion for the bus subsystems. 

Module Description: 
The overall funct ion of the power module  is to estimate  the mass requirements for both solar 
array and RTG power sources based on the average and peak power requirements for the bus 
and payload  subsystems  and on  the mission  lifet ime,  interferometer  type,  and orbital  radius. 
The  first  funct ion  of  this  module  is  to  size  the  solar  arrays  and  RTG  needed  to  satisfy  the 
average power demand  for the TPF spacecraft.  For this particular mission, average power  is 
provided  when  the  spacecraft  is  imaging  a  target  star  or  an  astrophysical  source.
  The 
select ion of a power source  invo lves a  trade between  the merits and  the faults of so lar arrays 
and  RTGs.    Solar  arrays  convert  incident  solar  radiat ion  to  electrical  energy  while  RTGs 
generate  electrical power by using  either  a  radio isotope  heat  source  through  thermoelectrics 
or by providing  thermal  energy  to  a  rotating generator.  Solar  arrays  benefit  from having  an 
unlimited  power  source  and  a  well-understood  technology.    However,  they  suffer  because 
the  array  material  degrades  over  the  mission  lifet ime  and  the  available  so lar  radiat ion 
decreases  as  orbital  radius  increases,  forcing  an  increase  in  the  so lar  array  area  to  provide 
adequate  output  power.    RTGs  provide  a  constant  power  source  independent  of  orbital 
locat ion but have a  limited source of fuel and  the  techno logy  is  not  very mature.  Therefore, 
mult iple mission parameters must be considered to help select the power source. 

The  calculat ion  of  the  mass  est imate  for  solar  arrays  requires  a  series  o f  step  that  apply 
power  generation,  conversion,  and  manufacturing  efficiencies  as  well  as  the  lifet ime 
degradation  to  the  solar  flux  and  the  maximum  sun  incidence  angle.    The  properties  o f  the 
solar arrays used  in the power module are shown in Table 6 [Larson & Wertz, 1992].

The  first  step  in  sizing  the  solar  arrays  is  to  calculate  the  total  power  available  based  on  the
solar  flux  (SF)  and  the  so lar  panel  (hsp)  and  secondary  power  conversion  (h2nd)  efficiencies
(Equation 19).

It  is  assumed  that  the  solar  arrays  on  the  TPF will  not  experience  an  eclipse  period  because
the  orbits  under  considerat ion  are  heliocentric  and  far  from  any  potential  eclipsing  bodies.
The  next  steps  ident ify  the  power  requirements  for  beginning-o f-life  (BOL)  and  end-of-life
(EOL)  operations.    The  calculat ion  of  the  power  per  unit  area  of  the  solar  array  at  BOL
accounts  for  the  manufacturing  efficiency  o f  the  solar  panels  (Id)  as  well  as  the  maximum
sun  incidence angle (qI) (Equation 20).   At EOL,  lifet ime degradat ion  is  applied  to  the BOL
calculat ion  to  determine  the  power  per  unit  area  required  by  the  spacecraft  to  conduct
operations and the end of the mission  lifet ime (Equation 21).

Another assumpt ion  is made concerning  the maximum  sun  incidence  angle.   The value used
for  qI  in  the  power  module  is  45(cid:176),  which  is  the  worst  case  condit ion  allowed  by  the
requirement  to  avoid  contaminat ion of  the  science  light  by  the  sun.    The  final  step  in  sizing
the  solar  arrays  is  to  calculate  the  area  and  the  mass  required  to  provide  adequate  output
power.    The  area  is  found  by  dividing  the  total  average  power  requirement  (Pavg)  for  the
ent ire  spacecraft  by  the  power  per  unit  area  at  EOL  (Equation  22).    The  mass  is  calculated
by  mult iplying  the  solar  array  area  with  the  areal  density  (ADsa)  of  the  material  used  to
construct the panels (Equation 23).

The  power  module  also  calculates  the  estimated  mass  of  an  RTG  power  source.    Table  7
describes the properties of the RTGs used  in this module [Larson & Wertz, 1992].

The  mass  calculat ion  for  RTGs  is  much  simpler  than  for  solar  arrays  because  this  power
source  provides  a  constant  level  o f  output  power  independent  of  orbital  radius.    Therefore,
the  required  output  power  for  the  RTG  is  found  by  simply  dividing  the  average  power
requirement  (Pavg)  for  the  spacecraft  by  the  power  conversion  efficiency  (hRTG) of  the  RTG
(Equation 24).   The mass  is  calculated by dividing  the  required  output  power with  the  RTG
specific power (SPRTG) (Equation 25).

Equation 25

The end result  is  the mass est imate for the RTG.   It  is  important  to note  that  the  architecture
type  is  included  in  the mass  est imates  for  the different power  subsystem  sources.   The  issue
is  that  only  one  power  subsystem,  located  on  the  central  bus,  is  required  for  an  SCI
architecture  while  an  SSI  architecture  requires  each  spacecraft  to  have  its  own  power
subsystem.    Since  the  impact  of  architecture  type  on  average  and  peak  power  demands  are
taken  into account by the other bus modules, the power subsystem mass  is simply  the sum of
the  mass  estimates  for  the  collector  and  combiner  spacecraft.    However,  the  overall  power
subsystem  mass will  be  higher  for  an  SSI  architecture  because  the  average  and  peak  power
demands will be higher to reflect the fact that each spacecraft requires  its own bus.

Once  the  mass  estimates  for  the  different  power  sources  have  been  determined,  the  power
module  moves  on  to  the  power  storage  requirements.    The  amount  of  power  storage
capability  required  for  the  power  subsystem  is  dictated  by  the  peak  power  demand  for  the
spacecraft.    Peak  power  is  provided  during  certain  periodic  spacecraft  operations  such  as
slewing  to  a  new  target,  transmitting  data  back  to  Earth,  etc.    The  peak  power  demand
affects  the  type,  number,  and  size  o f  the  storage  batteries.    The  properties  o f  the  batteries
used  in the power module are  listed  in Table 8 [Larson & Wertz, 1992].

The  first  step in  finding  the mass of the batteries  is  to  calculate  the  required battery  capacity 
based  on  the  peak  power  load  (Ppeak),  the  time  length  of  the  peak  power  cycle  (Tpeak),  the 
depth  of discharge  (DOD),  the  number  of  batteries  (N),  and  the  transmission  efficiency  (n) 
between battery and  load (Equation 26). 

C  = 
r 

Ppeak  * T peak 
(DOD ) *  N * n 

Equation 26 

In  this  module,  the  number  of  batteries  is  est imated  based  on  the  architecture  type.  A  total 
of  three  batteries,  located  on  the  central  bus,  are  used  for  an  SCI  architecture  while  two 
batteries  for  the  combiner  spacecraft  and one battery  for  each of  the  collector  spacecraft  are 
used  for  an  SSI  architecture.  The  number  of  batteries  can  be  adjusted  to  trade  between 
battery  mass  and  vo lume.    The  mass  of  the  batteries  is  found  by  dividing  the  required 
capacity with the specific energy density (SEDb) of the battery (Equation 27). 
= C r  SEDb 

M b 

Equation 27 

The  last  step  in determining  the total mass  for  the power subsystem  is  to estimate  the masses 
of  certain  miscellaneous  components  such  as 
the  power  control  unit  and 
the 
regulators/converters  (the  wiring  mass  is  estimated  in  the  propulsion  module).    This 
miscellaneous  mass  is  combined with  the  power  source  and  battery  mass  est imates  to  yield 
the total mass of the power  subsystem.   The power  source  and battery properties used  in  the 
power module were  adjusted  in  favor of  certain  techno logical  advances  that  are  expected  to 
happen  before  the  construction  of  TPF.    Some  of  these  include  higher  power  conversion 
efficiencies,  specific  power,  and  specific  energy  density  as  well  as  lower  lifet ime 
degradation.   Most  of  these  assumpt ions  are within  reason  but  certain  advances  still  need  to 
be  demonstrated  before  they  are  completely  valid.  The  mass  est imates  for  the  power 
subsystem are  used  by  the  spacecraft  bus  and  payload  macro-module  to  determine  the  best 
power  source  based  on  thermal  considerat ions  (so lar  arrays  provide  a  certain  level  of  heat 
shielding)  as  well  as  to  optimize  the  mass  and  power  distribut ion  for  the  ent ire  spacecraft 
bus. 

Trade Space: 
The  trade  space  that  is  specific  to  the  elements  of  the  power  module  is  somewhat  limited. 
An  init ial trade of the power  source used  in  this  subsystem can be  conducted  to make  a  first 

guess  at  the  orbital  radius where  the  source  should  be  switched  from  so lar  arrays  to  RTGs. 
Figure 25 illustrates the mass relat ionship between the different power sources.

Figure 24.  Solar Array and RTG Power System Masses 

This  plot  shows that  at orbits  lower  than  about  2.25 AU,  solar  arrays  should  be  used  as  the 
power  source,  while  at  orbits  outside  this  limit,  RTGs  will  provide  the  same  amount  of 
power with a  lower subsystem mass.   However, solar arrays can provide a certain amount of 
thermal  shielding,  which  would  increase  the  so lar  array/RTG  crossover  point  based  on  the 
combined  mass  of  the  power  and  thermal  subsystems.    Because  of  this,  the  trade  between 
solar  arrays  and  RTGs  is  conducted  in  the  Spacecraft  bus  and  payload  Macro-Module, 
where  the  power  and  thermal  mass  estimates  can  be  combined.  Addit ionally,  the  power 
subsystem mass  is  incorporated  into  the mass  and power  trade between  the  communicat ions 
and  the  propulsion  subsystems.    This  trade  attempts  to  find  the  optimal  mass  and  power 
estimates for all the components of the spacecraft bus. 

7.3.4  Propulsion Module 
Module Motivation: 
The  propulsion  system  provides  the  energy  to  maneuver  the  spacecraft  system  between 
targets  and  to  dump  built  up  momentum.    In  a  separated  spacecraft  (SSI)  mission,  the 
propulsion system must  also provide  the  energy  to  rotate  each  co llector  spacecraft  about  the 
combiner, maintaining  a  constant  angular  velocity  and  the  system  line  o f  site.  The  purpose 
of  the  propulsion  module  is  to  estimate  the  mission  V  requirements  and  to  chose  the 
appropriate  attitude  control  thrusters.   For  an  SSI  mission,  the  primary  purpose  of  the 
propulsion module is to design a continuous low, thrust system.

The  time  required  to  transfer  between  targets  influences  the  imaging  rate  of  the  science 
mission.  From a propulsion standpo int,  it requires  less energy and propellant  if more  time  is 
spent  coasting  between  targets.  The  coasting  time  is  limited  by  the  baseline  mission 
requirement  and  by  the  minimum  mass  philosophy  o f  the  bus.    So,  as  with  any  propulsion 
system,  there  is  a  trade  between  mass,  energy  and  time.    The  current  baseline  mission, 
however, does not appear to be time  limited.   This will be demonstrated  in more detail in  the 
module descript ion sect ion. 

The pr imary dr iver for the propulsion system in a structurally connected (SCI) mission  is the 
locat ion  of  the  thrusters.  The  thruster  plumes  are  restricted  from  infringing  into  the  line  of 
site  of  the  science  instruments,  and  are  required  to  be  in  the  general  vicinity  of  the 
propulsion tanks.  That  is,  the  thrusters  could  not be placed on  the  end of  a deployable  truss 
without  an  adjo ining  tank.  The  tank  location  restrict ion  was  established  to  simplify  the 
deployment strategy. 

On  the  other  hand,  the  primary  driver  for  the  propulsion  system  in  the  SSI  mission  is  the 
amount  of  time  spent  in  continuous  thrust.  The  thrust  time  is  determined  by  the  number  of 
targets  in  the  mission  baseline  and  the  total  time  spent  integrating  the  science  data  at  each 
target.   Indirect ly,  the  signal  to noise  ratio  (SNR) requirement of  the  science  data  drives  the 
SSI propulsion module development.  The SNR is the most influent ial factor for determining 
the  integration  time,  and  therefore  the  continuous  thrust  requirement  and  propellant  mass. 
The  integration  time  is  described  in  more  detail  in  the  aperture  configuration  module 
sect ion. 

Module Description: 
The  propulsion  module  takes  the  fo llowing  inputs:  the  mission  architecture,  the  mass 
estimate  of  the  spacecraft,  the  integration  time,  the  allotted  subsystem  power,  and  the 
momentum  storage  capacity  of  the  momentum  wheels.    The  source  for  the  inputs  are  the 
design  vector,  the  structural  mass  est imator  module,  the  aperture  configurat ion  module,  the 
power module, and the ACDS module.  Using these  inputs, the propulsion module calculates 
the  dry  mass  of  the  propulsion  system,  the  propellant  mass,  and  the  wiring  mass  of  the 
power system, which depends on  the final system dry mass.  The module  inputs and  outputs 
are shown  in Figure 30.

SCI Architecture 
The  focus  of  the  SCI  propulsion  model  is  on  selecting  and  modeling  the  attitude  control 
thrusters.  These  thrusters  are  sized  to  maneuver  the  spacecraft  between  targets,  while 
satisfying the  imaging rate requirement and the low mass philo sophy o f the bus.  For the SCI 
mission,  reaction  wheels  maintain  the  angular  momentum  o f  the  spacecraft.  To  slew 
between  targets,  an  appropriate  set  of  thrusters  will  fire  and  the  spacecraft  line  o f  site  will 
precess  to  the  next  target.   To  ensure  the  thrusters  are  designed  for  the worst  case  scenario, 
the  propulsion  system  will  be  able  to  slew  the  momentum  biased  spacecraft  from  a  resting 
posit ion.    This  is  equivalent  to  slewing  the  spacecraft  in  a  direction  which  none  of  the 
angular momentum  can  be  utilized  for  the  precession.    The worst  case  thrusting  times  for  a 
slew maneuver are calculated using Equation 28.

Equation 28 

The variable  td  is  the  thruster duty  cycle,  Izz  is  the moment  of  inert ia  of  the  spacecraft  about 
its spin axis,  l is the moment arm of the thruster, 
is the angular velocity o f the imaging and 
transfer stage, respectively. 

If  the  thrusters  are  placed  on  the  deployable  truss,  the  moment  arm  length  and  the  moment 
are  known.  The  angular  velocity  o f  the  imaging  session  is  set  to  one  revolut ion  for  every 
two hours, a reasonable  integration  time estimate.   The force  level o f the  thrusters  is  set  to  5 
Newtons  and  the  transfer  slew  rate  is  set  to  0.05  degrees  per  second,  which  will  have  a 
minimal dynamic effect on the spacecraft.  The worst case transfer  time  is determined by  the 
angle  between  the  targets.   The  baseline  mission  includes  150  targets.   If  these  targets  are 
scattered along the celest ial sphere -- as far away from one another as possible -- the  transfer 
angle  is 15 degrees.  A 15-degree  transfer will  take 5 minutes, which defines  the  thrust  time 
when mult iplied  by  the  thruster duty  cycle.   The  thrust  time was  calculated  for  a  reasonable 
range  of  spacecraft  inertias  (estimated  from  the  structural  module).  This  relat ionship  is 
plotted in Figure 26.

Figure 26. Thrust time vs. Moment of Inertia

Figure 26 shows a reasonable  range of  thrusting  t imes  for  a 5-minute  transfer.   The  baseline
mission  consists  of  150  surveys,  50  coarse  spectroscopy  and  5  fine  spectroscopy  sessions.
Assuming  the  scientists  will  not  know  whether  a  surveyed  planet  is  a  candidate  for
spectroscopy unt il all  the surveys are completed, there will be  a  total of 205  transfers.   Even
if  5  minutes  elapse  for  each  transfer,  the  total  transfer  time  for  the  mission  is  st ill  less  than
one day, which  is negligible compared to a 5-year mission.

A total o f 12 thrusters, placed  in  suites of 3, will provide simultaneous,  three axis  translation
and  rotation  capability.    The DV  expenditure  for  a  target  transfer  maneuver  was  calculated
using the simplified plane change formula  in Equation 29.

DV plane change

= 2V sin(q 2)

Equation 29

DV  is  the  change  in  velocity  required  by  the  propulsion  system,  q  is  the  angular  distance
between the targets, and V is the current tangent ial velocity o f the deployed truss.
Note that plane change propellant was allotted for  each  spacecraft  imaging  session,  even  for
situations where  the  plane  change  may  be  slight  or  nonexistent.    This  margin  was  included
to  ensure  that  a  reasonable  amount  of  propellant  would  be  left  for  astrophysical  imaging
operations, which begin after the primary mission has been completed.

The plane change equation  is  typically applied  to a single spacecraft held  in orbit by gravity.
In an SCI mission, the analog  is two thrusters (180 degrees out of phase) held  in place by  the
spacecraft  structure.    A  factor  of  4  will  be  applied  to  Equation  29  in  order  to  calculate  the
total  transfer DV.   One  factor  of  2 was  included  because  the  spacecraft must  start  and  stop;
the other factor of 2 was  included  because  the  two  thrusters must be  fired  simultaneously  to
maintain  a  constant  angular  velocity.    This  DV  calculat ion  is  valid  if  the  combiner  section

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­

mass  is  distributed  very clo se  to  the  center  of  gravity,  and  the  deployed  truss  mass  is  not  a 
major  contributor  to  the  spacecraft  inertia.    (This  is  not  necessarily  a  good  assumpt ion.) 
Furthermore,  the  three-axis  dynamics  of  the  problem  have  been  simplified  in  Equat ion  28, 
which assumes that the thrusters fire without disturbing the body fixed angular velocit ies. 

A certain amount of  V was allocated for spinning up the spacecraft for the cruise phase,  for 
stopping  the  rotation  prior  to  interferometer  deployment,  and  for  the  init ial  rotation  of  the 
extended  configuration. The propellant  expenditure  for momentum dumping  is based on  the 
total  impulse  that  must  be  applied  to  unload  a  reaction  wheel  at  its  saturation  limit.  The 
propellant mass required for momentum dumping was calculated using Equation 30. 

M dump 

=

(H lt )t total

Equation 30 

H  is  the momentum limit of  the reaction wheels,  l  is  the moment  arm,  t  is  the pulse  t ime  for 
one  pulse,  ttotal  is  the  total  length  of  time  spent  pulsing  over  the  ent ire  mission,  Isp  is  the 
specific  impulse of the thruster, and g is the acceleration of gravity.   The  impulse required  to 
de-saturate  the  reaction wheels  was  approximated  in  the  ACDS  module  and  is  summarized 
in  Table  9.    The  moment  arm  was  based  on  the  average  distance  to  the  thruster  suite 
posit ions  because  the  momentum  saturation  could  occur  in  any  direct ion.    The  worst  case 
scenario  requires  the  momentum  to  be  dumped  once  per  day,  for  each  of  the  four  reaction 
wheels.

Due  to  the  relatively  high  force  level o f the  thruster,  electric  thrusters were  eliminated  from

The  propulsion module  considers  the  specific  impulse  of  the  thruster,  the  total mission  V, 
and  the  total  impulse  required  for  momentum  dumping  when  determining  the  propellant 
(wet) mass required for the baseline mission.  For simplicity,  the dry mass of  the system was 

ASTRO-002 Rev. --
May 17, 1999
Page 80 of 175

assumed  to  15%  of  the  wet  mass  --  a  reasonable  est imate  for  chemical  systems.    This
method  favors  the  higher  impulse  of  the  bi-propellant  engine,  but  in  pract ice  these  systems
are  more  complicated  and  have  higher  dry  masses.    In  future  versions  of  the  TMAS,  the
propulsion  module  should  include  a  comprehensive  look-up  table  of  o ff-the-shelve  thruster
systems,  which  have  known  thruster  and  valve  mass  values.    The  propulsion  model  would
then size the vo lume and mass o f the propellant tanks, and determine the total dry mass.

Collect ing  the  total  impulse requirements  for momentum dumping and  the  total mission DV,
the propulsion module so lves the fo llowing system of equat ions for each thruster option.

Mo  is  the  init ial  spacecraft mass, Mp|transfer  is  the  propellant  required  for  slewing  from  target

momentum,  and  Md|estimate  is  the  init ial  dry  mass  estimate.    The  factor  1.04  is  included  in
Equation  33  because  the  power  system  wiring  is  about  4  percent  of  the  total  system  dry
mass.

The propulsion module  code  then  finds  the  minimum  mass  system  and  returns  this  value  to
the  Spacecraft  Macro-Module.    In  future  versions  of  the  propulsion  code,  a  trade  of
complexity  versus  mass  could  be  incorporated.    This  would  return  a  more  practical  design
value.  The aforementioned dry mass simplification and  the neglected complexity effects are
an example of compromising fidelity for quick (and working) simulation.

SSI Architecture
The focus of the SSI propulsion model  is on selecting and designing a continuous,  low  thrust
system.    (The  centrifugal  force  provided  by  the  structure  in  an  SCI mission  is  replaced  by  a
propulsion  system  in  an  SSI  mission.)    The  required  thrust  value  is  a  funct ion  of  the
collector  spacecraft  mass  and  the  distance  that  the  collector  spacecraft  is  rotated  about  the
combiner spacecraft.  The thrust calculat ion  is  included as Equation 34.

T = M (w
imaging R) 2 R

Equation 34

T is the thrust, w  is the angular velocity of an  imaging maneuver, and R  is  the radial distance
the collector spacecraft orbits about the combiner spacecraft.   This relat ionship  is plotted for
a  reasonable  range  of  co llector  spacecraft  masses  in  Figure  27.    The  dynamics  of  Equation
34  are  quite  simple  because  circular  orbits  are  assumed.    A  more  detailed  analys is  of  the
orbit ’s  influence on an SSI mission  is available  in [Stephenson, et al].

The  ion  bombardment  engine  was  selected  for  the  SSI  mission  because  it  meets  all  the 
requirements and because  it can be  implemented quite easily as a  funct ional design.   The  ion 
engine has the fo llowing traits. 

•  Negligible effect on the thermal sub-system. 
•  Little plume  impact on the science gathering  instruments. 
•  A relatively simple operation throughout the thrust range. 
•  A considerably high efficiency. 
•  Wide support and  interest within the  industry. 

The  ion  engine  works  by  accelerat ing  posit ive  ions,  produced  by  bombarding  a  neutral  gas 
propellant  with  electrons  emitted  from  a  cathode.   The  electrons  are  influenced  by  a  weak 
magnet ic  field,  so  they  spiral  towards  the  anode.  The  spiral mot ion  is  necessary  because  it 
slows  the  electrons  down  so  that  they  actually  co llide  and  ionize  a  neutral  propellant  atom. 
The  ions  are  accelerated  through  a  pair  of  grids  because  a  strong  electric  field  is  applied 
between  them.   Electrons  are  ejected  into  the  ion  stream,  so  that  the  plume  remains  neutral. 
A simple  ion engine  is sketched  in Figure 28.

Varying  the  vo ltage  applied  across  the  accelerat ing  grid  controls  the  electric  field  strength. 
By  varying  the  electric  field  strength,  one  effect ively  controls  the  thrust.    Note  that  it  is 
inefficient  to  operate  an  ion  engine  at  off-nominal  condit ions.    This  inefficiency  was  taken 
into account in the modeling of the propulsion system. 

Future  versions  of  the  propulsion  module  should  consider  adding  Hall  thrusters  into  the 
trade space.  Hall  thrusters are generally much  less massive and more compact  then  their  ion 
engine  counterparts.   Hall  thrusters  have  some  lifetime  degradation  issues,  but  are  being 
developed  quite  extensively  in  the  US.    Hall  thrusters  were  not  included  in  this  version  of 
the  code  because  the  analysis  is  still  quite  well  guarded,  so  there  is  relat ively  litt le 
informat ion available to  the public.

The propellant mass o f the low thrust engine was dominated by  the  length of  time  the engine
was  operated.    The  first  design  decision  was  to  determine  whether  it  required  more
propellant  to  stop between  imaging  sessions  or  to  continue  to  thrust  and  precess  to  the  next
target.  The pause duration  time  for which  it  is more  effic ient  to  start  and  stop rather  than  to
continuously thrust is determined by Equation 35.

Equation 35

The  variable  tcutoff  is  the  cutoff  t ime,  and  wimaging  is  the  angular  velocity  o f  an  imaging
maneuver.    For  the  nominal  integrat ion  time,  the  cutoff  t ime  is  on  the  order  of  30  minutes,
which  is  a  reasonably  short  period  of  time.    Considering  the  housekeeping  procedures  that
will be necessary during an SSI mission,  it appears that start-stop operation  is  feasible.   This
assumpt ion was carried throughout the SSI propulsion module development.

The  attitude  control  thruster  design  for  the  combiner  spacecraft  matches  the  procedure
outlined  in  the  SCI  section,  assuming  that  the  combiner  remains  fixed  in  space.    Note  that
the  5  Newton  thrusters  can  easily  apply  the  DV  needed  to  start  and  stop  the  collector
spacecraft.    So,  the  attitude  control  thruster  design  of  the  collector  spacecraft  is  similar  to
that of  the SCI  spacecraft,  except  that  the plane  changes become  simple  rotations,  start-stop
pulses are  included, and the  impulse required for momentum dumping  increased.  (See Table
9.)

The  continuous  thrust  time  calculat ion  is  straightforward,  assuming  start-stop  operation  o f
the  collectors.    The  continuous  thrust  is  based  on  the  baseline  mission  and  the  nominal
integrat ion times summarized  in Table 12.

According  to  the  baseline  mission,  the  total  continuous  thrust  requirement  totals  265  days.
(This does not  include  the astrophysical  imaging.)   In order to  include  enough propellant  for
astrophysical  imaging  and  off-nominal  operations,  a  margin  of  3  was  included  in  the
continuous  thrust calculat ion.   This amount of continuous  thrust  is more  realist ic  in  terms of
the  5  year  mission,  but  can  lead  to  a  relat ively  large  propulsion  system  mass.    The
continuous thrust calculat ion  is potentially a  large source of error  in  the system, and can be a
cause for discrepancies  in benchmark cases.

While,  the  image  integration  time  is  calculated  in  the Aperture  Configuration  module,  there
is  no  limit  to  its  length.    So,  the  continuous  thrust  value  is  calculated  as  a  funct ion  of  the

ASTRO-002 Rev. --
May 17, 1999
Page 84 of 175

actual  integration  t imes.    This  way,  longer  integration  times  are  penalized  in  terms  o f  the
propulsion  system.    Furthermore,  the  Aperture  Configurat ion  module  assumes  that  longer
integrat ion  times  occur  in one  long period, which  corresponds  to  an  extremely  slow  angular
velocity.    The  ADCS  and  propulsion  modules  assume  that  this  integration  time  is  broken
into two hour periods because the ADCS can not maintain  the strict point ing requirement for
days  on  end.    Momentum  will  have  to  be  dumped.    The  prime  concern  in  long  integration
times,  from a propulsion standpoint,  is  the slow angular velocity.   According  to Figure  27,  a
substant ial decrease  in angular  velocity will result  in  a decrease of  the  thrust  level  below  the
available range  of  all  electric  thrusters.   This  restrict ion  should  be  applied  in  future versions
of the propulsion module.

The  low  thrust  section  of  the  propulsion  module  takes  the  power  allocated  to  the  system  to
make  a  mass  estimate  of  the  system  and  to  calculate  the  corresponding  specific  impulse  of
the ion engine using Equation 36.

F  is  the  thrust  force, h  is  the  efficiency o f  the  engine,  P  is  the  allocated  power,  and  g  is  the

so  large  mass  penalt ies  were  assessed  to  systems  were  the  power  is  either  too  low  or  too
high.   The  engine  efficiency was  intent ionally  chosen  closer  to  the  low  end  (of  ion  engines)
because  of  the  wide  rage  of  operating  thrusts.    The  thruster  force,  F,  is  a  funct ion  of  the
mass,  as  shown  in  Equation  34.    The  mass  was  based  on  the  init ial  dry  mass  fract ion,
mult iplied  by  a  corrective  factor.    The  corrective  factor  can  be  back  calculated  using  the

Trade Space: 
There  are  no  fundamental  design  trades  for  the  SCI  propulsion  system.    The  primary  driver 
in  the  SCI  system  mass  is  the  baseline  mission,  which  is  set.    A  future  trade  for  the  SCI 
propulsion  system  could  be  addit ional  propellant  versus  addit ional  imaging  sessions. 
Because  the  baseline  mission  is  so  generously  margined,  this  trade  will  not  be  useful  until 
the ent ire mission (including astrophysical imaging) becomes more definite. 

The  fundamental  design  trade  for  the  SSI  propulsion  system  is  mass  versus  power.  The  dry 
mass  components  of  the  propulsion  system  will  slowly  increase  with  power,  while  the 
propellant mass decreases as the specific  impulse  increases. 

Using  the propulsion module  code,  the  relat ionship  between mass and  power  for  a  collector 
spacecraft  is  plotted  in  Figure  29.    The  combiner  spacecraft  does  not  have  an  electr ic 
propulsion system and  is not included  in this trade.

Figure 29.  Propulsion System Mass for a Given Integration Time 

Figure 29 demonstrates the expected trend  – a decr easing system mass  for  increasing power. 
This  indicates  that  the  wet  mass  savings  outweigh  the  dry  mass  gain,  which  corresponds 
with  intuit ion.    The  vertical  lines  in  Figure  29  correspond  to  the  mass  penalt ies  at  the 
techno logy  limit s (in terms of specific  impulse) of the  ion engines.   Notice  that  the  larger  the 
dry mass  est imate  is,  the  larger  the  propulsion  system mass  ranges.    This  demonstrates  the 
direct  impact  mass has on  thrust  and hence on  specific  impulse,  as  indicated  in Equation  34 
and  in  Equat ion  36.  The  higher  the  mass,  the  larger  the  corresponding  power  must  be  to 
span the specific  impulse range o f ion engines. 

The  propulsion  system  module  does  not  try  to  choose  the  optimal  po ints  in  Figure  29. 
Instead  it allows the spacecraft bus algorithm to perform a bus-wide optimizat ion.  However, 
in mo st cases, the minimum bus mass corresponds to a minimum propulsion system mass. 

7.3.5  Thermal Module 
Module Motivation: 
Three  thermal  requirements  have  been  derived  from  the  system  requirements  for  the  TPF 
mission  and  are  shown  in  Table  13  below.    The  Optical  Detector  and  Optical  Train 
temperature requirements are derived from the specificat ions for the  instrument  sensit ivity in 
the  near  IR  frequencies.    The  Spacecraft  Electronics  temperature  requirement  is  derived 
from  the  operating  temperature  range  for  space  qualified  electronic  components.
  The 
ambient  blackbody temperature  for  the  spacecraft  is expected  to  be  between  100  and  200 K 
for  the  range  of  solar  orbits  under  considerat ion,  indicat ing  a  need  for  both  cooling  and 
heat ing capabilit ies for different parts of the spacecraft.

The  spacecraft  is(are)  assumed  to  have  a  hot  side  and  a  cold  side,  separated  by  some
combinat ion  of  thermal  shields  and Mult i-layer  insulat ion  (MLI).    The  amount  of  shielding
required  for  each  collector  is  calculated using  the  collector  size,  the  incident  solar  radiat ion,
typical  properties  o f  MLI  (absorptivity,  emissivity,  etc.),  and  an  assumed  radiative  shape
factor of 0.5 between successive shields.   The  init ial number of shields (2 or 3)  is selected  to
meet  the  optical  train  cooling  requirement.    Most  calculat ions  are  based  on  the  Stefan-
Boltzmann  equat ion  (Equation  46).    For  cases  that  use  solar  arrays  to  generate  spacecraft
power,  the  outermost  thermal  shield  is  eliminated  since  the  so lar  array  can  provide  an
equivalent shielding effect.

For  the  detector,  the  thermal  shields  are  assumed  to  be  part  of  the  bus  structure.    The  final
stage  of  cooling  to  the  optical  detector  requirement  temperature  is  assumed  to  be
accomplished  using  a  cryocooler.    The  simplifying  assumpt ion  was  made  that  the  thermal
shields  could  be  appropriately  designed  such  that  this  final  stage  cryocooler  will  have
essent ially  the  same  requriements  regardless  o f  operational  orbit  and  onboard  power

Trade Space: 
The  fundamental  trade  in  the  thermal  module  is  between  mass  and  power.   The  init ial 
configuration  is  generated  to  use  the  minimum  power  by  maximizing  the  use  of  passive 
cooling  techniques.   Subsequent  thermal  system  configurat ions  are  generated  by  replacing 
thermal  shield  elements,  starting  with  the  most  massive,  with  a  generic  act ive  cooling 
element  assumed  to  be  a  cryocooler  (mass  of  40  kg  and  continuous  power  requirement  of 
150  W).  This  informat ion  is  used  by  the  bus  integration  module  to  conduct  a  bus  level 
power vs. mass optimizat ion. 

7.4  Dynamics, Optics Controls, and Structures (DOCS) Macro-Module 
The Dynamics,  Optics  Controls,  and  Structures  (DOCS)  Module  provides  the  link  between 
aperture  physics  and  the  performance  modeling  in  the  GINA  module.  The  motivat ion  for 
this  module  is  the  desire  to  model  the  difficult ies  in  maintaining  a  nanometer  precision 
optical  pathlength  between  the  apertures  and  the  combiner  of  the  TPF  for  SCI  and  SSI 
spacecraft  architectures.  Figure  31  provides  an  overview  of  the  DOCS  module,  including 
inputs,  data  flow,  and  outputs.   The  fo llowing  sect ions  describe  the  modules  in  the  order

7.4.1  Structural Design Module 
Module Motivation: 
The  purpose of  the  structural  design module  is  to  automat ically  create  reasonable  structural 
models  for  structurally  connected  (SCI)  and  separated  spacecraft  (SSI)  interferometer 
concepts. 

Module Description: 
The  generic  spacecraft  design  is  based  on  the  simple  concept  of  a  central  hub,  which 
contains  the  combiner,  the  spacecraft  bus,  and  the  high-gain  communicat ions  antenna.   The 
apertures  are  located  in  a  plane  around  the  hub  and  are  identified  by  their  radius  from  the 
hub  and  their  clock  angle.   This  informat ion  is  provided  by  the  aperture  configuration 
module.  In  the  structurally  connected  case,  a  deployable  truss  connects  each  aperture  with 
the central hub or with another aperture  that  is  located on  the  same  radial spoke.  Each  truss 
and  its  associated  canister  are  dimensioned  based  on  exist ing  empirical  engineering 
relat ionships  for  truss  diameter  and  mass.   The  design  is  parameterized  and  scales  with  the 
number of apertures and with the number of radial spokes  from the central hub; this  includes 
the shape o f the hub itself.

Figure 32.  Design of Hub Base Plate 

The  first  step  in  the  structural design module  is  the  design  of  the  hub  base  plate.   Figure  32 
shows  the  configuration  for  2  and  4  radial  spokes  on  the  left  and  for  6  radial  spokes  on  the 
right.  The  number  of  radial  spokes  does  not  necessarily  correspond  to  the  number  of 
apertures,  since  several  apertures may  be  located  along  the  same  radial  direct ion.  Next,  the 
bottom and  top  plates  and  the  vertically  connect ing  structure  (truss  elements)  are  designed. 
Again,  the  dimensions  are  parameterized  based  on  the  Lockheed-Martin  A2100  bus  design 
[Lockheed  Martin].   The  high  gain  antenna  is  added  as  a  circular  parabo lic  dish.  The 
antenna diameter and point mass are obtained  from  the bus macro-module and are computed 
based  on  the  orbital  radius.   The  apertures  are  modeled  as  simple  siderostat  bays  with 
crossbars  to  improve  rigidity.   The  central  node  contains  the  collector  mass  and,  in  the  SSI 
case,  the  additional  mass  due  to  the  separate  bus  components  that  support  each  collector 
spacecraft. 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­

In  the  SCI  case,  the  code  proceeds  with  the  truss  design  and  calculates  the  truss  system 
mass,  the  corresponding  mast  diameter,  and  the  canister  mass  fract ion  for  a  deployable 
articulated truss of a given baseline  and  bending  stiffness.   These  funct ions  are based on  the 
ABLE  Deployable  Articulated  Mast  (ADAM)  System  [ADAM  Techno logy  Manual]  and 
consists of 2D-lookup tables  for these crit ical truss and canister design parameters.  The 2D­
lookup  tables  were  created  from  a  plot  in  the  AEC-ABLE  technical  manual:  "ADAM 
System  Mass,  Corresponding  Mast  Diameter  and  Canister  Mass  Fraction  vs.  Bending 
Stiffness  for  25m,  50m,  100m  and  500m Deployment  Lengths."  The  data  for  the  10  meter 
baseline  was  extrapolated.  Figure  33  provides  a  graphical  representation  of  these  lookup 
tables.

Figure 33.  Lookup Tables for Truss Properties 

Due  to  the  large  dimensions  of  the  separat ions  between  apertures  in  the  SCI  case,  it  would 
be  difficult  to  model  the  deployable  trusses  between  the  apertures  in  such  detail  that  each 
truss member  (jo ints,  longerons,  battens,  diagonals) would  be  represented  by  one  or  several 
finite  elements.   Such  an  approach would  lead  to  an  extremely  large  order  FEM.  Consider, 
for example, a  truss with 20 bays and 16 nodes per bay.   This would  lead  to  20*16*6= 1920 
degrees of  freedom  for only a single  truss.  Therefore,  it  is  standard practice  to  represent  the 
truss  with  equivalent  Bernoulli-Euler  (BE)  beam  elements.    This  is  acceptable  up  to  an 
aspect  ratio  of  bay  diameter/length  of   ~  25.   For  very  long  slender  beams  a  T imoshenko 
beam representation is preferable.

Figure 34. Graphic Representation of an Assembled Finite Element Model

The BE beams capture bending  in 2 direct ions:    torsional and axial  tension and compression.
However,  it  is  important  that  realist ic  material  properties  are  used  for  the  equivalent  beam
elements.  A special effort was made  in this respect.  Other beam properties such as  torsional
stiffness, GJ, were determined  from  the bending  st iffness, EI, based on  the  equivalent  ratios
for  the  SRTM  mission  [Gross  and  Messner].    Once  the  truss  elements  are  designed,  the
ent ire  FEM  is  assembled,  including  the  associated  material  properties,  the  boundary
condit ions, and the global mass and stiffness matrices, M and K.   The FEM can be displayed
by the user as shown  in Figure 34.

The  FEM  model  is  compat ible  with  and  requires  access  to  the  IMOS  V2.0  toolbox.    The
fo llowing  funct ions  from  IMOS  are  called  from  within 
the  Structures  Module:
posunique.m,  trans.m  mkboom.m,  genrot.m,  unit.m,  bcond.m,  conm.m,  truss.m,  beam.m
cg_calc.m,  wtcg.m,  viewfem.m,  iso.m,  scale.m,  rotx.m,  fourvu.m.    An  effort  was  made  to
restrict  the  utilized  element  types  to  bars,  beams  (Bernoulli-Euler  formulat ion),  generalized
stiffnesses  (celas)  and  to  concentrated  masses  (conm’s).    The  current  version  only  uses
beams,  rods  and  conm’s.    The  structural  design  module  also  computes  the  CG  location,  the
total system mass, and the tensor of  inertia  in spacecraft coordinates.

Fo llowing  the finite  element model,  the plant model  is  responsible  for  creating  a  state  space
representation  of  the  spacecraft  (plant)  structural  dynamics.    The  generalized  eigenvalue
problem  [Craig]  is  shown  in  Equat ion  47,  where  l w= 2   are  the  eigenvalues,  which
correspond to the squares of the natural frequencies o f the system.

The variable l i  is  the  ith eigenvalue of  the structure and fi  is  the  ith eigenvector.   The fi’s  are
the  columns  of  the  matrix F ,  that  is  somet imes  referred  to  as  the  mode  shape  matrix.    The
eigenvalues are computed by setting the determinant of [K-li M] to zero.

Equation 48

The  result,  after  evaluat ing  the  determinant  and  some  algebra,  is  a  polynomial  o f  degree  n
equal  to  the  number  of  degrees  of  freedom  of  the  system,  that  can  be  solved  for  the
eigenvalues, l .   The eigenvalues with a value of zero correspond  to  the  rigid  body modes  (6
total).  These are crit ical for the design of the TPF attitude determination and control system.

The  next  step  consists  of  comput ing  the  eigenvectors,  fi.  The  physical  interpretation  of  the
eigenvectors  as mode  shapes  is  based  on  the  underlying  notion  that  the  relat ive  magnitudes
of  the  components of  the  eigenvector  correspond  to  the dynamic displacements occurring  at
that particular natural frequency.
It  is  useful  and  customary  to  normalize  the  columns  o f  the  eigenvector  matrix,  F .    For
structural  dynamics  purposes,  the  mass  matrix  M  is  used  for  this  normalizat ion.    In  the
normal  coordinate  frame,  arbitrary  motions  of  the  system  are  represented  by  linear

The modal  form of  the equations of motion  is  especially  convenient because  the  coupled 2nd
order  different ial  equat ions  are  now  decoupled,  which  makes  them  easy  to  solve.    At  this
point,  it  is  convenient  to  add  damping  to  the  TPF  system  design  by  setting  the  damping
coefficient, z, to 0.001.

In practice  ,  the modal damping coefficients are often different for every mode  and  typically
vary between 0.1% and 3% for  light ly damped space structures.   The  equations of motion  in

The other  important  relat ionships  that  complete  the  state  space  representation  are  the output
y and  the performance  z equat ions.   In general,  the outputs are given as a  linear combinat ion
of  the  coordinates  in  physical  space  (Equation  58),  or  as  a  combinat ion  of  states  in  modal

The vector y contains all  the outputs of  the  system  that  are  captured by  sensors,  i.e.  they  are
actually measured, whereas z contains the metrics by which the performance of the system  is
assessed.

The  strategy  for  the  SSI  case  is  to  solve  the  generalized  eigenvalue  problem  for  each
spacecraft  individually  and  then  to  append  them  into  the  overall  system  as  completely
parallel  systems.    The  only  thing  that  ties  them  together  is  the  performance  metric  and  the
ADCS.

7.4.2  Optics Control Module
Module Motivation:
The  optics  control  module  is  responsible  for  computing  the  optics  linear  sensit ivity  matrix,
which  relates  the  physical  displacements  and  rotations  of  the  combiner  and  the  apertures  to
the  optical  performance  metrics.    Currently  the  only  opt ical  performance  metric  included  is
the  optical  pathlength  difference  (OPD).    Future  work  could  include  line-of  sight  (LOS)
jitter, wavefront tilt (WFT) and different ial beam shear (DBS).

Module Description:
Figure 35  shows how  the OPD  is  computed  based  on  the  pathlength  difference  between  the
reference aperture and the  ith aperture.

The  optical  pathlength  difference  is  defined  as OPDi = OPLref  - OPLi  and  can  be  computed 
as  a  linear  combinat ion of  the  displacement  degrees  of  freedom  from  the  hub,  the  reference 
aperture, and the  ith aperture, as indicated  in Equation 61.

Equation 61 

OPLref  is  the  optical  pathlength  from  the  reference  aperture  to  the  hub.    The  reference 
aperture  is  the aperture with  the  largest radial distance  from  the hub  and  appears  first  in  the 
sorted  aperture  list.   R  is  the  distance  of  the  aperture  to  the  reference  plane  of  the  incoming 
stellar  wavefront.  The  quant ity  zref  is  the  z  displacement  of  the  reference  aperture.  The 
quant ity rref is the nominal radius of  the reference aperture from  the hub.   Furthermore, dref  is 
the  displacement  vector  of  the  reference  aperture,  uref  is  the  unit  normal  vector  along  the 
radial o f the reference aperture, and do  is the displacement vector of the hub.

In Equation 62, OPLi  is  the optical pathlength of  the  i  th  aperture,  zi  is  the  z  displacement of 
the  i th aperture, ri  is  the radial distance of  the  i  th aperture, rODLi  is  the  fixed delay  introduced 
by  the  optical  delay  line  (ODL)  of  the  i  th  aperture,  di  is  the  displacement  vector  of  the  i  th 
aperture,  and ui  is  the unit  normal  vector  along  the  radial  belonging  to  the  i  th  aperture.  The 
ODL  located  within  the  combiner  sect ion  is  assumed  to  be  able  to  compensate  for  the 
nominal  pathlength  difference  between  the  hub  and  the  reference  aperture,  resulting  in 
Equation 63.

Based  on  this  assumpt ion,  only  the  relat ive  displacements  of  the  hub  and  apertures  with

the above relat ionships.   Optical control  through ODL’ s and  fast  steering mirrors  (FSM)  has

not  been  modeled  in  great  detail,  but  the  effect  of  optical  control  on  the  OPD  has  been 
approximated.  This  is done by passing  the optical performance metrics  through  a  low order 
high pass filter, which treats each channel independent ly as shown in Equation 64.

7.4.3  Attitude Determination and Control Module 
Module Motivation: 
In order to provide  the nulling performance needed  for planet detection,  the geometry of  the 
TPF  optical  instruments  must  be  maintained  within  very  strict  accuracy  requirements.  To 
satisfy  this  goal  and  to  allow  for  the  limited  bandwidth  and  dynamic  range  of  available 
sensors  and  actuators,  a  layered  control  system  is  designed.  In  the  current  design,  two 
decoupled  control  loops  are  envisaged.    The  Attitude  Determinat ion  and  Control  System 
(ADCS)  will  be  responsible  for  controlling  the  optics  posit ion  and  attitude  with  cent imeter 
and  arc-second  accuracies.  The  main  purpose  of  the  ADCS  is  to  stabilize  rigid  body 
mot ions,  and  to  reject  disturbances  at  low  frequencies.  This  is  achieved  by  sensing  the 
current  attitude  (and  relative  position  in  the  SSI  case)  using  an  appropriate  suite  of  sensors 
and  providing  control  torques  and  forces  using  thrusters  and  angular  momentum 
control/storage devices. 

The ADCS subsystem design  is strongly coupled with  the spacecraft configuration, and with 
other  subsystems,  such  as  the  propulsion  subsystem.  The  purpose  of  the  ADCS  design 
module  is  to  characterize  the  achievable  performance  in  the  face  of  the  foreseen worst-case 
environmental  disturbance  and  the  spacecraft  disturbances  injected  into  the  system  by  the 
ADCS  actuators  themselves  (namely,  the  effects  of  static  and  dynamic  imbalances  in  the 
React ion  Wheel  Assemblies).  The  results  of  the  ADCS  module  are  also  used  to  size  the 
reaction wheel assemblies (RWAs). 

Module Description: 
Due  to  the  wide  range  o f  variability  o f  several  key  options  in  the  TPF  system  design,  care 
has  been  taken  in  the  design of  this module  to  automatically  determine  an  “o ptimal”  ADCS 
system,  with  no  direct  intervent ion  by  the  human  operator.  The  ensuing  ADCS  design  is 
only  locally (to  the ADCS)  optimal,  and no  claims  are  made  about  optimality  in  the  broader 
system  sense.    However,  some  considerat ion  and  constraints  fo llowing  from  physical 
intuit ion  and  engineering  insight  have  influenced  the  design  process,  at  least  as  far  as  the 
coupling with closely related modules is concerned (DOCS). 

ASTRO-002 Rev. --

During TPF mission  lifet ime,  the  spacecraft will operate  in different  attitude  control  modes,
namely
•  emergency, or safe mode (e.g. sun point ing),
• 
transfer orbit mode,
• 
format ion change/slew mode,
•  science observat ion mode.
These  modes  are  characterized  by  different  requirements  in  terms  of  accuracy  and
robustness  to  other  subsystems  failures  or  anomalies,  and  consequent ly  will  usually  require
the use of different sensors and possibly different actuators.

The  ADCS  module  has  been  developed  to  meet  the  most  difficult  requirements,
corresponding  to  the  science  observation  mode.    For  the  science  mode,  the  mission
requirements  can  be  met  only  by  a  three-axis  stabilizat ion  technique  (even  though  the  TPF
spacecraft  in  the envisioned operational pro file will be spinning,  the rotation rate of 2 rpm  is
far from enough to provide any consequential gyroscopic st iffness).

At  the  TPF  operational  orbit,  the  (external)  disturbance  torques  will  be  dominated  by  the
solar  radiation  pressure  effect,  and  to  a  lesser  extent,  by  the  tidal  or  gravity  gradient  effect.
The torque due to the solar radiation pressure can be expressed as Equation 68.

Equation 66

Fs  is  the  so lar  constant  (1358  W/m2  at  the  Earth’s  orbit)  ,  c  is  the  speed  of  light,  As  is  the
cross-section  area,  cps  is  the  center  of  so lar  pressure,  cg  is  the  center  of  gravity,  q  is  the
reflectance  factor (assumed  to be 0.6), and  i  is  the angle of  incidence of  the Sun (taken  to  be
0).

The  actual  computation  of  the  location  of  the  so lar  center  of  pressure  can  be  an  extremely
difficult  task.   Since all attitude configurations with respect  to the Sun should be considered,
interact ions  between  different  parts  of  the  system  should  be  taken  into  account  (e.g.
shadows),  and  specific  details  about  the  system  implementation  would  be  needed  (e.g.
reflectance  factor  for  the  different  materials).    To  reduce  the  complexity  of  the  system
performance  evaluation,  only  a  worst  case  deviation  due  to  solar  pressure  of  5%  of  the
maximum baseline  length  is considered.

The maximum  torque due to the different ial gravity  forces  can be  expressed  as Equation 70,
where m  is  the  gravitat ional  parameter of  the  Sun,  R,  is  the  orbital  radius,    and  Imax  and  Imin
are respectively the maximum and minimum moments of  inertia.

The mass property data are readily available  from  the structural design module (at  least  their 
nominal  values).    For  the  TPF,  the  effect  of  the  gravity  gradient  is  noticeable  only  for  the 
SCI case with very  long baselines. 

Apart  from  externally  generated  disturbances,  some  on-board  systems  will  generate 
indigenous  disturbance  torques  and  forces.  The  main  sources  of  such  disturbances  will  be 
the  reaction  wheel  assemblies  and  the  cryocoolers  (described  in  the  disturbance  analysis 
module). 

The generation of disturbances by  the RWA  presents  an  interesting  control problem,  in  that 
the  use  of  RWA  for  stabilizing  the  rigid  body  modes  results  in  an  effect ive  transfer  of 
disturbances  power  from  low  frequencies  to  higher  frequencies  corresponding  to  the 
harmonics of the RWA revo lut ion speed. 

Moreover,  in  the  SSI  case,  the  thrusters  will  be  firing  during  observat ions  to  maintain 
format ion.  Since  the  operational  scenario  calls  for  a  rotating  baseline,  the  thrusters  will  be 
constantly  providing  the  required  centripetal  acceleration.    This  continuous  thrusting  will 
inevitably  translate  into  some  torque  disturbance  due  to  misalignments.  A  worst  case 
misalignment angle  is assumed to be 1 degree. 

The  main  attitude  sensing  devices  for  high  accuracy  requirements  are  star  trackers.  To 
improve  the  achievable performance o f  the  closed-loop ADCS  system,  the  addit ional use  of 
rate gyros  is  suggested.  The  result ing  attitude  sensing  is  very  similar  to  the  current  design 
for  the  NGST  [Mosier  and  Fermiano,  1999].  The  NGST  ADCS  design  team  claims  that 
such  a  system  will  provide  an  attitude  steady  state  error  (1  )  of  0.3  to  0.4  arcsec  when 
combined with  a Kalman  filter.   The  sensor  sample  rate  is  assumed  to  be  10 Hz  for  the  rate 
gyros,  and  2  Hz  for  the  star  trackers.    For  the  TPF  mission,  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  a 
better  performance  since  the  star  trackers  can  be  samp led  at  a  relat ively  high  rate.   This  is 
due  to  the  fact  that  the  optics  boresight  will  be  pointed  at  a  rather  close  and  bright  star,  in 
contrast  to  NGST,  which  will  be  looking  at  very  faint  objects.    As  a  consequence,  the 
integrat ion times required from the star trackers on the TPF can be considerably lower. 

The  attitude  actuators  on  the  TPF  will  consist  of  reaction  wheel  assemblies  (RWAs)  for 
angular momentum control and storage, and thrusters for slewing maneuvers,  for momentum 
dumping, and for formation flying  in the SSI case. 

The  RWA  design  in  this  module  is  dictated  by  several  factors.    First,  the  RWA  torque 
capability  must  be  greater  than  the  maximum  expected  environmental  torque.  Second,  the 
RWA  must  be  able  to  store  enough  momentum  to  reduce  the  frequency  o f  momentum 
dumping  operations  below  a  given  thresho ld  (e.g.  once  a  day).    Momentum  dumping 
requires  the  use  of  thrusters,  and  hence  could  disrupt  the  attitude  accuracy  attained  dur ing 
science  observat ions.    Third,  rather  than  fine  tuning  the  available  “ free  parameters”   that 
characterize  the  momentum  wheels  (i.e.  mass  properties,  max  speed,  max  torque),  a 
“COT S ”  approach  is  taken.  The  most  appropriate  commercially  available  RWA  that 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 99 of 175 

satisfies  the  minimum  torque  and  momentum  storage  requirements  is  selected  from  a  range 
of  RWAs  produced  by  Ithaco,  as  reported  in  their  web  site,  http://www.ithaco.com.    The 
number  of  RWAs  required  is  usually  four,  mounted  in  such  a  way  as  to  provide  three 
independent direct ions with  any  three RWAs,  to maintain  full control authority  in  the  event 
of a single  failure.

The  TPF  ADCS  design  is  based  on  methods  adapted  from  [Mosier  and  Fermiano,  1999], 
[Athans, 1998],  and  [Dahleh  and Diaz-Bobillo, 1995].  The  interested  reader  should  refer  to 
these  sources  and  to  textbooks on advanced  linear  control  for mathemat ical  details.   A  brief 
discussion fo llows. 

To perform an automated control system design  for  the TPF spacecraft,  the  structural model 
must  be  reduced  to  a  manageable  size  without  loosing  any  relevant  dynamics  informat ion. 
First,  the  uncontrollable  and  unobservable  modes  are  removed.   One  such mode  is  the  rigid 
body  translat ion  mode  of  the  entire  TPF  spacecraft.    This  mode  is  (linearly)  unobservable, 
since  it requires accurate orbit determinat ion, which can not be determined direct ly  from the 
attitude  and  relat ive  posit ion measurements.   However,  there  is  no  requirement  for  the  TPF 
spacecraft  to  remain  at  an  exactly  specified  locat ion  in  space,  only  that  the  collectors  are 
kept  in  the  nominal  posit ion  with  respect  to  the  combiner  during  science  gathering 
operations.    Thus,  the  rigid  body  modes  invo lving  translat ions  of  the  combiner  may  be 
safely removed  from the controller model. 

Even after the removal o f  these modes  (3x2  states), the  structural model  is  st ill  too  large  for 
effect ive  controller  design.  A  model  reduction  is  required.    A  popular  method  for  model 
reduction  invo lves  balancing  the  plant.   Common  (i.e.  available  in  MATLAB)  numerical 
algorithms  for  finding  a  balanced  realizat ion  (that  is,  a  realization  for  which  the 
controllability  and  observability  gramians  are  equal  and  diagonal)  require  str ict ly  stable 
plants, whereas  the TPF structural  plant  still  includes  all  the  rigid  body modes  (attitude  and 
collector  translations).    To  address  this  issue,  the  rigid  body  modes  are  converted  to  low-
frequency,  lightly damped modes by adding  “vi rtual  springs ” b etween  the  spacecraft  model 
and fixed po ints  in space. 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 100 of 175 

Once  there  is  a  balanced  realizat ion,  a  reduced  order  model  can  be  obtained  by  (balanced) 
truncation, or by finding  the optimal Hankel norm approximation (via  the Nehari ’s   theorem, 
see  [Dahleh  and  Diaz-Bobillo,  1995]).   The  option  is  left  to  the  user,  who  can  set  the 
appropriate  flag  in  the  TMAS  so ftware,  together  with  the  maximum  number  of  modes  to 
retain. 

Once  a  reduced  order  model  is  obtained,  a  generalized  plant  is  constructed  that  takes  into 
account  the  translat ion  in  the  frequency  domain  of  performance  requirements  (command 
tracking,  disturbance  reject ion,  etc.).  This  is  done  by  the  standard  technique  of  adding 
performance  weights,  effect ively  designing  an  “ obstacle  course” 
for  the  loop  transfer 
funct ion, see [Athans, 1998].  Frequency weights are added to the OPD error (the metric that 
must  be  minimized),  as  a  low-pass  filter  to  obtain  good  tracking  at  low  frequencies. 
Addit ionally,  frequency  weights  in  the  form  of  a  high  pass  filter  are  added  to  the  control 
channels  to  enhance  the  robustness  to  noise,  unmodeled  dynamics,  and  t ime  delays  by 
avo iding  high  control  bandwidth.    The  high  pass  filter ’ s  gain  increases  starting  at  a 
frequency that  is  10%  of  the  first  non-zero  frequency  of  the  original  plant  (the  first  flexible 
mode).    This  design  process  is  an  automated  version  o f  the  “ LQR  control  cost  tweaking” 
technique for controller bandwidth select ion. 

Finally,  some comments about the  attitude  sensing  subsystem. To  avoid dealing with details 
such  as  raw  data  filtering  and  attitude  reconstruction  (quaternion  propagation,  etc.),  the 
attitude  estimat ion  process  is  simulated  by  the  addit ion  of  a  frequency  varying  no ise  to  the 
attitude  measurement  channels.    Again,  this  is  a  high-pass  filter,  with  a  steady  state  gain 
given by the  expected  steady  state  error of  the  attitude Kalman  filter  [Mosier  and  Fermiano, 
1999]. The  increase  in no ise power at frequencies higher than 5Hz ensures that the controller 
will not respond to (or, in fact, require) higher rate signals.

Once  the  generalized  plant  is  built,  the  control  system  design  process  can  proceed.   The H2 
and  Hinf  optimal  controllers  are  derived  and  are  output  to  the  rest  of  the  DOCS  module.

7.4.4  Integration Module 
Module Motivation: 
The  purpose  of  this  module  is  to  assemble  the  integrated  model  based  on  the  previous 
designs  of  the  structure,  the  optical  train  and  the  control  loops.  The  integrated  model  is 
represented  in  LTI  state  space  form  and  can  be  used  for  the  subsequent  dynamic 
performance  analys is.    The  integrated  model  contains  the  structural  plant,  ADCS,  and 
optical controllers, as well as  the  linear  sensit ivity matrix Cz  that relates  the physical degrees 
of freedom of the opto-structural system to the performance metrics of interest. 

Module Description: 
The  inputs  to  the  integrated model  are:  the  input matrix  Bw,  the  FEM  dynamics  state  space 
system,  the ADCS  controller  in  state  space  form,  the optics  linear  sensit ivity matrix C z,  and 
the optical control state space system.  This is represented in the block diagram in Figure 38.

The  effect  of  the  ADCS  system  and  of  the  optical  controller  on  the  stability  of  the  science 
light  passing  through  the  TPF  system  is  extremely  important.  The  effects  can  be  seen  by 
examining  the  sample  transfer  funct ion  in  Figure  39.   The  top  curve  shows  the  rigid  body 
behavior  of  the  TPF  if  there  were  no  active  ADCS.  This  is  clearly  not  acceptable  and  the 
system  must  be  stabilized.  The  effect ive  bandwidth  of  the  ADCS  controller  is  1  decade 
below  the  first  flexible  mode  of  the  system.   The  optical  control  (third  curve  from  top) 
provides significant attenuation of the disturbances.

Trade Space: 
A conso lidated discussion of the DOCS module trades is included  in Section 7.4.6 below. 

7.4.5  Disturbance Analysis Module 
Module Motivation: 
It  is  assumed  that  the  two  principal  dynamic  disturbances  will  be  on-board  and  that  the 
major contributions are  from the reaction wheel  assembly  (RWA)  and  from  the  cryocoolers, 
which are  necessary  to  cool  the  IR  detectors.  Two  separate  routines  compute  the  RWA  and 
Cryocooler  disturbance  spectra.
  In  the  current  version  of  the  TMAS,  only  RWA 
disturbances have been  implemented. 

Module Description: 
React ion  wheel  disturbances  are  modeled  as  power  spectral  densit ies  (PSD’ s)  that  describe 
the  disturbance  energy  frequency  content.   The  RWA  disturbance  funct ion  generates  RWA 
disturbance  PSD’ s  in  spacecraft  axes  for  an  arbitrary  number  of  wheels  and  an  arbitrary 
orientation  of  the  RWA.  It  uses  [Melody]'s  model  o f  the  disturbance  PSD's  for  a  single 
wheel.  These react ion wheel disturbances are  injected  into the system and  their effect on the 
optical pathlength difference  is determined  in the disturbance analys is module.

Figure  40  depicts  the  RWA  disturbances  generated  by  a  react ion  wheel  assembly  with  four 
wheels  in a pyramid configurat ion.   This  is  the configuration chosen for the TPF structurally 
connected model  (SCI). The wheel  speed  is  assumed  to vary uniformly  between 0  and 2000 
RPM.      For  the  SSI model,  each  spacecraft  is  assumed  to  have  its  own  RWA  that  produces 
no ise.  This  is  one  of  the  reasons why  maintaining  equal  pathlength  in  the  SSI  case  is  more 
challenging.

The  disturbance  analys is  returns  a  PSD  for  the  OPD  of  each  aperture  with  respect  to  the 
reference  aperture.  The  reference  aperture  is  defined  by  the  optics  modeling  routine.  The 
OPD  of  the  reference  aperture with  respect  to  itself  is  obviously  zero.  Figure  41  shows  an 
example  OPD  PSD  for  aperture  #1  with  respect  to  the  reference  aperture  #2.  The  top  plot 
shows  the  cumulat ive  RMS  curve  of  the  OPD,  the  middle  curve  shows  the  performance

It  is  interest ing  to note that  there  is significant dynamic  amplificat ion over  certain  frequency 
regions.  The  top  subplot  shows  the  cumulat ive  RMS  curve  that  is  obtained  by  integrating 
under  the  performance  PSD.    It  can  be  observed  that  most  of  the  RMS  errors  are 
accumulated  in  a  frequency  regime  between  7  and  40  Hz.   This  is  typical  for  space  based 
structures  with  these  dimensions  and  phys ical  properties.    The  normalized  cumulative  area

Almost  100  %  of  the  RMS  error  is  caused  by  only  three  modes  of  the  system.    This  is  an 
interest ing  and  surprising  result.  Figure  43  illustrates  the  relative  contribution  o f  the  RWA 
components at these modes for this OPD metric. The results shown are applicable  to  the SCI

7.4.6  DOCS Macro-Module Trades
This  sect ion  describes  just  two of  the  many  trades  that  are  possible  using  parameters  in  the
DOCS  module.    The  two  parameters  discussed  are  the  RWA  disturbance  level  and  the
optical  control  bandwidth.    Changing  these  values  will  have  a  fundamental  impact  on  the
dynamics,  the  transmissivity  funct ion,  the  resulting  integration  t imes  for  a  given  SNR,  and
ult imately the cost per image of the observatory.

The  first  trade  shows  the  effect  that  reaction  wheel  imbalances  can  have  on  the
transmissivity  funct ion,  and  ult imately  on  the  signal  to  noise  ratio.    The  reaction  wheel
disturbance  data  was  obtained  from  a  test  of  the  ITHACO  E-Wheel  conducted  at  NASA
GSFC  in  1998  [Mosier  and  Brown].    The  wheel  speed  distribut ion  was  assumed  to  be
uniform  between  0  and  2000  RPM.    The  combined  effect  of  4  wheels  in  a  pyramidal
configuration  is  taken  into  account.    The  left  subplot  in  Figure  45  shows  the  effect  of  the
reaction wheel  imbalances  that where obtained  from  the  test without any modificat ion  to  the
test data.   The  transmissivity  image has  four  symmetric  lobes  (fringes of peak  intensity)  and
the suppression of starlight meets the specificat ion of 10-6 out to the star diameter.

The  right  subplot  demonstrates  the  effect of  scaling  up  the wheel  imbalances  by  a  factor  of
10.    This  could  occur  if  the  wheels  are  poorly  balanced  or  if  a  ball  bearing  fails  during
operations.   The  effect  on  the  transmissivity  image  is  dramatic.    First, one  pair  of  fringes  is
being washed  out  by  the  vibrat ions.    Second,  the  nulling  of  the  starlight  at  the  center  of  the
image  is no  longer meet ing  the  requirements.   In  the nominal  case,  the  sOPD  (average)  is  76
nm.    It  is  762  nm  in  the  second  case,  which  corresponds  to  roughly  l/16.    For  non-
interferometric  systems,  such  a wavefront  error might  be  acceptable,  but  for  TPF,  it  clearly
is not.  This  is an  illustration of why the requirement for the OPD is l/6000.

 
Figure 45. Demonstration of  “Washout ” Effect Due to RWA Noise (Right Side)

A  second  interest ing  trade  concerns  the  optical  control  bandwidth.  This  trade  provides  an
indicat ion  of  the  fidelity  o f  the  DOCS  macro-module.  The  effect  of  optical  control
bandwidth  limitat ions  on  the  system  is  modeled  using  a  high-pass  filter  approach.    Each
OPD  channel  is  attenuated  by  the  optical  controller  at  low  frequencies  but  not  at  high
frequencies due to assumed  limitat ions on sensor and actuator bandwidths.

ASTRO-002 Rev. --
May 17, 1999
Page 108 of 175

Figure  46  shows  the  effect  on  the  transmissivity  funct ion  of  changing  the  optical  controller
bandwidth.   If  the optical  controller bandwidth  is  too  low,  the optical pathlength differences
between  the  apertures  create  a  time-varying  phase  difference  fi  between  the  light  beams  at
the  combiner.    This  phase  shift  disturbs  the  +/-  180-degree  phase  shift  requirement  for
perfect  nulling.    A  simplifying  assumpt ion  is  that  the  OPDs,  which  are  the  square  roots  of
the  variance  of  a  stochastic  random  signal,  are  added  to  the phase  shift  used  to  compute  the
transmissivity  as  if  they  were  determinist ic.    Thus,  the  perturbations  from  the  perfect
transmissivity  shown  above  are  to  be  understood  in  a  1  sigma  sense.    This  calculat ion  is
shown  in Equation 73.

Equation 73

The  sz  value  for  the  ith  aperture  is  then  converted  into  a  phase  delay,  fk,  which  is  injected
into  the  transmissivity  function.    It  can  be  said  that  dynamic  disturbances  degrade  the
transmissivity  funct ion,  especially  the  nulling  performance  of  the  parent  star, when  the  fk ’s
are injected into the transmissivity equat ion (Equation 74).

Preliminary  results  indicate  that  the  science  requirements  can  not  be  met  with  an  optical
bandwidth  of  5  Hz,  but  that  increasing  the  bandwidth  to  100  Hz  leads  to  sufficient
suppression of the onboard dynamic disturbance sources.

7.5  Operations Macro-Module

7.5.1  Orbit Module
Module Motivation:
According  to  the  TPF  Book,  orbit  select ion  is  one  of  the  principal  mission  development
issues.   Earlier studies by Ball, Lockheed Martin, and TRW  suggested  that  the orbital  radius
for  TPF  should  be  between  1  AU  (Earth  orbit)  to  5.2  AU  (Jupiter  orbit).    Orbit  select ion
influences many  areas  of  the TPF mission,  including  aperture  size,  power,  communicat ions,
thermal control,  launch vehicle, and flight time to the operational orbit.

Module Description:
The Orbit Module  takes orbit  as  an  input  and  provides  informat ion  about  delta V  and  flight
time.  Delta V is the velocity change required for orbit transfer and  the  flight  time  is  the  time
to  get  to  the  desired  orbit  from  the  Earth.   The Orbit Module  calculates  three  delta Vs:    the
departure  delta  V,  the  arrival  delta  V,  and  the  total  delta  V.    The  departure  delta  V  is  the
delta V  needed  at  the  init ial  point  of  transfer  orbit,  the  arrival  delta V  is  the  delta V  needed
at the final po int of the transfer orbit, and the total delta V  is the sum o f departure and arrival
delta Vs.   The delta V outputs will be used by  the propulsion  and  launch  vehicle modules  to
calculate  thrust  levels  and  to  select  the  launch  vehicle.    The  flight  time  informat ion  will  be
used  as  an  input  by  the  operations  and  the  GINA  modules  to  estimate  time  dependent
funct ions such as operations cost.

According  to  the  previous  studies,  the most  favorable  candidate  locat ion  for  the  TPF  in  a  1
AU orbit  is  at  the L2  point, which  is  60  degrees  ahead  of  the  Earth,  as  shown  in  Figure  47.
Hill’s  transfer  method  is  used  to  calculate  the  delta  V  and  the  flight  time  required  to  reach
this  orbit.    The  Hill  transfer  method  is  accomplished  by  entering  an  elipt ical  orbit  with  a
shorter period than the  init ial orbit so that when the spacecraft reaches  its next apogee,  it will
be separated from the Earth by  the desired phase (see Figure 47).  The departure delta V and
arrival  delta  V  are  equal  and  opposite  and  the  flight  time  is  approximately  equal  to  the
period of  the  new  orbit.   The  fo llowing  equat ions were  used  to  calculate  the  departure  delta
V,  arrival  delta  V,  and  the  flight  time.    Both  departure  and  arrival  delta  V  are  about  2.17
km/s and the estimated flight time  is about 0.82 year.

Figure 47. Hill’s Transfer to L2 Orbit

If  the  desired orbit  is greater  than 1AU,  an  interplanetary Hohmann  transfer  method  is  used
to  estimate  departure  delta  V,  arrival  delta  V,  total  delta  V,  and  flight  time.    The
approximate flight time  is about one half of  the period of  the  transfer orbit.   All  transfers are
assumed  to  start  from  a  300  km  LEO  parking  orbit.    As  illustrated  in  Figure  48,  the
Hohmann  transfer  technique consists of performing  a departure delta V  at  the perigee o f  the
transfer  orbit  fo llowed  by  an  arr ival  delta  V  when  it  reaches  apogee  to  circular ize  the  final
orbit.   The  fo llowing equations show how to calculate  the  arrival delta V, departure delta V,

and  the  flight  time  using  Hohmann’s  transfer  method.    These  calculat ions  do  not  use  the
gravity  assist  technique,  which  may  help  to  reduce  the  delta  V  requirements  by  using  a
planet ’s gravity  to  redirect  the  spacecraft. The plots  in Figure 49  show  the  total  delta V  and
the flight time as functions of orbital radius.

Trade Space: 
The  fo llowing  trade  studies  show  the  importance  of  orbit  select ion  and  describe  how  the 
orbit influences different areas of the TPF mission. 

• 	 Orbit vs. Apertures Size:  Since the Sun’ s gravity attracts gas and dust, the  local zodiacal 
environmnet  at  smaller  orbits will  cause  greater  interference with  TPF  observat ions  and 
will force the use of larger apertures. 
• 	 Orbit vs. Solar Power:  The option  to use  solar power  for  the TPF mission becomes  less 
viable as the orbit increases. 
• 	 Orbit  vs.  Communicat ion:    The  communicat ions  system  size  and  power  requirements 
increase with increased TPF orbit. 
• 	 Orbit vs. Thermal Control:   The  load on the  thermal  control  system becomes  greater  for 
lower orbits. 
• 	 Orbit  vs.  Launch  Cost  and  Flight  Time:    If  the  orbit  is  further  away from  the  Earth,  the 
launch cost and flight time will be  increased.

The  launch  vehicle  places  TPF  into  the  desired  orbit.    The  launch  vehicle  select ion  is  an 
important part of the Operations Macro-Module because  it contributes to a significant  part of 
the  total  mission  cost.   A  launch  vehicle  incorporates  one  or  more  upper  stages  which 
provide  necessary  delta  Vs,  calculated  by  the  Orbit  Module.  Although  the  launch  process 
can  severely  constrain  spacecraft  design  for  most  of  space  missions,  the  Launch  Vehicle 
Module  does  not  drive  the  design  process  for  TPF.   Rather,  it  provides  a  launch  vehicle 
according to the total mass calculated by the TMAS. 

Module Description: 
The Launch Vehicle Module  takes  the mass of TPF and  the  arrival delta V  as  inputs,  selects 
a  launch  vehicle,  and  provides  the  cost  associated  with  the  launch  vehicle.    Although  both 
mass  and vo lume of TPF  should be used  as  inputs,  only mass was  used  as  an  input  because 
TMAS  does  not  calculate  the  exact  volume  o f  a  stowed TPF.  The  Launch Vehicle  Module 
only  considers  using  a  single  launch  vehicle.   However,  it  is  possible  that  SSI missions  can 
be  launched  using  mult iple  vehicles  because  they  consist  of  more  than  one  spacecraft. 
Therefore,  comparing  the mult iple  launch  vehicle  scenario  to  the  single  vehicle  scenario  for 
SSI missions  is recommended as a future work. 

The  departure  delta  V  and  arrival  delta  V  are  the  delta  Vs  needed  at  the  perigee  and  the 
apogee of  a  transfer orbit.  There  are  two ways  to provide  these velocity  changes.   One way 
is  to  use  two  different  upper  stages,  one  for  the  perigee  kick  and  one  for  the  apogee  kick. 
The  other way  is  to  have  the  launch  vehicle  provide  the  perigee  kick  necessary  to  meet  the 
departure delta V  requirement  and  to have only one  upper  stage  for  the  arrival  apogee  kick. 
This  second  option  is  called  a  ‘ direct  insertion. ’  While  direct  insertion  invo lves  some 

ASTRO-002 Rev. --

complicated  scheduling  and  maneuvers,  the  total  mass  is  smaller  since  the  launch  vehicle
must  only  carry  one  upper  stage  instead  of  two.    Since  the  total  launch  cost  is  direct ly
proportional  to  the  total  launch  mass,  the  Launch  Vehicle  Module  for  TPF  has  been
designed  to use the direct  insert ion case  to minimize  the  launch  cost.   Figure 50  summarizes
the inputs and outputs of the Launch Vehicle Module.

The  size  and  mass  of  the  upper  stage,  which  provides  the  apogee  kick,  increase  as  the
required  arrival  delta  V  increases.    The  arrival  delta  V  increases  as  the  orbital  radius  from
the Sun  increases.  Therefore, a bigger and more powerful  launch vehicle  is required  to carry
the  upper  stage  and  the  TPF  to  the  desired  orbit  as  the  orbital  distance  from  the  Sun
increases.    Using  the  fo llowing  equations,  the  mass  of  an  apogee  kick  upper  stage  is
calculated  according  to  the  required  arrival  delta  V.    The  upper  stage  is  assumed  to  use
liquid oxygen and hydrogen  for propellant  in order to generate high specific  impulse,  Isp, of
400 seconds.

After  calculat ing  the  mass  of  an  apogee  kick  upper  stage,  the  total  mass  inside  the  launch
vehicle  fairing  can  be  calculated  by  adding  the  mass  of  the  TPF  and  the  mass  of  the  upper
stage.  According  to the  total mass,  the Launch Vehicle Module selects  a  launch  vehicle  and
provides the  launch cost.  Table 14 shows  the  list of  launch vehicles  that were considered by
the module.

The  launch  vehicles  listed  in  the  above  table  are  selected  based  on  the  maximum mass  that 
can  be  carried  by  that  vehicle.    If  the  total  mass  exceeds  21,640  kg,  the  Launch  Vehicle 
Module  does  not  provide  a  launch  vehicle  and  assumes  the  launch  cost  will  be  higher  than 
300 million dollars. 

Trade Space: 
• 	 Launch Cost vs. Mass of TPF:   As  the mass of  the TPF  increases,  it requires a  larger and 
more  powerful  launch  vehicle.  Therefore,  the  launch  cost  increases  as  the  mass  of  the 
TPF  increases. 
• 	 Launch  Cost  vs.  Orbit:   If  the  orbital  radius  from  the  Sun  increases,  the  TPF  requires 
higher  delta  V  to  achieve  the  desired  orbit.  Higher  delta  V  means  that  the  TPF  will 
require  a  larger  and  more  powerful  upper  stage  for  the  apogee  kick.    This  will  increase 
the  total mass.    Therefore,  increasing  the  orbital  radius  from  the  Sun  also  increases  the 
launch cost. 
• 	 Launch  Cost  vs.  Number  of  Launch  Vehicles:    Although  the  option  of  using  mult iple 
launch  vehicles  for  the  SSI  case  was  not  considered  for  this  module  due  to  time 
constraints,  it will be  interest ing  to see the relationship  between  the  total launch cost  and 
the  number  of  launch  vehicles.    It  may  or  may  not  decrease  the  total  launch  cost  if  the 
SSI  spacecraft  are  launched  by  mult iple  launch  vehicles.    This  trade  study  is 
recommended for future work. 

7.5.3  Operations Module 
Module Motivation: 
Operations  costs  comprise  a  significant  portion  of  total  mission  costs,  especially  over  long 
duration  missions  like  the  TPF.  They  are  sometimes  considered  “ hidden”   costs  since  they 
accrue  over  time  in  an  unobtrusive  manner  after  high  profile,  high-t icket  items  such  as 
development, construction, and  launch.   Tradit ionally, operational  issues are relegated  to  the 
tail  end  of  a  spacecraft  design  process,  and  rarely  influence  the  decision  criterion  of  key 
system  trades  that  they  direct ly  affect.    This  is  not  to  imply  that  operations  crews  do  not 
attempt  to optimize  their efficiencies  throughout  the mission, but rather  that some  spacecraft 
are  inherent ly  more  difficult  to  operate  than  others.    Higher  operational  difficulty  leads  to 
larger costs.  Therefore, the inclusion o f operations costs into the TPF trade analys is allows a 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 116 of 175 

more  thorough  systems  examinat ion,  with  the  twofo ld  result  of  lower  total  costs  and 
improved discriminat ion between alternate designs. 

Operational  issues  also  affect  the  TPF  design  trade  in  an  important  area  besides  cost. 
Dissimilar  TPF  configurat ions  generate  different  rates  of  anomalies  along  with  varying 
anomaly  response  times.   While  not  direct ly  affect ing  cost,  the  anomaly  frequency  and 
response  capability  influences  overall  system  performance.  This  is  very  important  in 
scientific  missions  with  an  established  design  life,  but  traditionally  has  not  been  captured 
during  early  system  studies.   Thus,  the  inclusion  of  operationally-derived  adjustments  to 
TPF performance  indices contributes needed fidelity to the design trades. 

Incorporating  the  impact  of  operations  into  the  rest  of  the  TPF  design  code  required  the 
formulat ion  of  operations  issues  into  quantifiable  forms.    In  addit ion,  a  necessity  arose  to 
develop  a  method  to  translate  differences  in  TPF  configurat ions  to  differences  in 
operational  difficulty.    The  size  of  this  challenge  became  apparent  after  the  discovery  that 
most  of  the  sparsely  exist ing  spacecraft  operations  literature  embraced  specific  case  studies 
and  qualitative  descriptions.    In  short,  no  previous  example  or  methodology    existed  to 
compare 
the  operational  differences  between  alternate  spacecraft  cho ices  of  an 
unprecedented astronomy mission with a  launch date several years  in the future. 

Module Description: 
The  operations module  provides  two main  types  of output  to  the  TMAS  software:  cost  and 
performance.    The  costs  are  split  between  development  costs  and  operations  costs,  and  the 
performance  is  given  by  mission  inefficiency.   Figure  51  shows  the  module’ s  inputs  and 
outputs.

Development costs represent the total mission expenditure before  launch, excluding  the costs
of  launch  and  the  theoretical  first  unit  costs  of  the  TPF  payload  and  bus.    More  complex
missions  require  longer  flight  and  ground  software  codes,  which  have  a  snowball  effect  on
other key development costs.  The individual components of the development cost are:

•  Flight Software
•  Ground Software
•  Facilit ies
•  Equipment
•  Logist ics
•  Management
•  Systems Engineering
•  Product Assurance
• 
Integration and Test

Operations  costs  consist of  labor  and maintenance  costs,  and  affect  the  mission  throughout
its useful  life.   Labor costs are a funct ion of crew size and salary  that the module determines
from  est imated  operational  complexity  and  failure  recovery  complexity.   Maintenance  costs
are modeled on the size and complexity of the flight operations center.

Mission  Inefficiency  represents  the  performance  output.    It  represents  the  science  imaging
time  lost from transmission delay t ime and anomaly reso lution t ime.

Labor Cost Approach
The  key  to  capturing  the  operational  differences  between  TPF  architectures  lies  in  a
quant ifiable  complexity  value  that  is  quasi  event-rate  based.    The  module  arrives  at
operations complexity by manipulating estimates  for mean  time  to  event, mean  t ime  to  false
event,  and mean  time  to non-permanent  failure.   Examples of  events,  false  events,  and  non-
permanent  failures  for  an  antenna  subsystem  are  slew  movements,  false  indicat ions  o f
crit ical  temperature,  and  gimbal  jamming  by  an  overheated  turntable,  respectively.
Permanent  failures  are  not  utilized  to  determine  complexity  since  direct  operational
interact ion  is  impossible  afterwards.    Thus,  the  operational  complexity  experienced  by  the
TPF operations crew  is defined as:

where  mttei,  mttfei,  and  mttfi  represent  the  mean  times  to  event,  false  event,  and  non-
permanent  failures,  respect ively,  for  a  specific  operations  funct ion  i,    N  is  the  number  of
addit ional spacecraft beyond one,   f i(N)  is  the relat ive  increase  in  the event rate as a funct ion
of  N,  Ai  is  the  basic  onboard  automat ion  percentage,  and  Xfe  and  Xf  are  the  complexity
adjustment factors for false events and non permanent  failures.   Notice  that basic automat ion
savings  only  apply  to  events.   Also  notice  that  Je,  the  complexity  from  events,  represents  a
true event rate, whereas Jfe and Jf represent quasi event rates because  they are adjusted by Xfe

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 118 of 175 

and  Xf.    This  adjustment  provides  a  higher  fidelity  est imate  of  total  system  complexity  by 
accommodating the  inherent ly higher difficulty o f anomalous  incidents over routine events. 

Table 15 gives the transit ion times for a generic single spacecraft, which served as a baseline 
for  complexity.    The  numbers  are  from    “A   Probabilist ic  Model  of  the  Effects  of  Satellite 
System Automat ion on Availability and Costs”  [Schwarz, 1997].  It  is  important  to  note  that 
as  TPF  development  proceeds,  higher  fidelity  est imates  of  transit ion  times  for  TPF-specific 
funct ions  will  become  available,  which  may  or  may  not  diverge  significant ly  from  the 
generic model given here.

It  is  important  to  realize  the  benefit  of  automat ion  on  total  operations  costs.   At  this  point, 
basic  automat ion  has  only  been  applied  to  routine  operation  events  (although  false-events 
are  exempted  from  the  recovery  complexity  calculat ion  by  ant icipated  advances).    Since 
each TPF architecture  is  equally  amenable  to higher order  automat ion  efficiencies,  like  self-
corrective failure capability, such techno logy was not included as a  tradespace different iator. 
Furthermore,  the  readiness  o f  such  tools,  while  being  vigorously  pursued,  is  open  to 
question  for  TPF  utilizat ion.  Currently,  the  costs  of  any  higher  order  automat ion  could  be 
considered  as  labor  costs,  but  if  some  TPF  architectures  are  found  to  exhibit  greater  cost 
savings  than  others  from  this  type  of  automat ion,  the  module  could  incorporate  the 
necessary separate funct ionality in the future.

Efficiencies result from operating several spacecraft from a single control  facility.   To model
this,  a  90%  learning  curve  was  applied  to  the  complexity  J.    The  adjusted  complexity  is
defined by

J = JL

Equation 96

where  N  is  the  number  of  spacecraft  beyond  one,  and  S  is  the  learning  curve  of  90%.
Therefore, each addit ional spacecraft causes  the  total operational complexity  to rise, but  at  a
proportionally reduced rate.

The adjusted complexity  is used as a discriminator for crew sizing.   The adjusted complexity
level  for  the  least  operationally  complicated  TPF  (structurally-connected)  is  baselined
against  steady-state  staffing  sizes  for  a  Hubble-class  astronomy  mission  using  input  from
industry.    Then  the  change  in  adjusted  complexity  from  addit ional  spacecraft  causes
increases  in  certain  segments  of  the  crew.    The  three  primary  crew  types  considered  are
flight operations (Fops), ground operations (Gops), and technical  experts  (techexperts).   The
Fops  crew  is  further  broken  down  into  the  three  segments  of  mission  planners  (MP),
spacecraft  controllers  (SC),  and  engineering  and  analysis  personnel  (E&A).    The  total  Fops
crewsize during the steady-state staffing phase  is defined by

Where K represents the baselined adjusted complexity,  the  factor 4 represents the number of
12  hour  shifts  required  for  continuous operation,  and  the  three  summed  bracketed quantit ies
represent the single-shift crew requirements for MP, SC, and E&A, respect ively.

The  steady-state Gops  crew  size,  in  contrast  to  Fops,  does  not  exhibit  the  same  dependency
on  complexity,  and  can  be  modeled  as  a  constant.    Any  cluster  of  separated  spacecraft  will
fly  clo se  enough  together  to  represent  collectively  a  single  target  for  ground-based  antenna
point ing  and  contact  scheduling.    The  operations  module  uses  a  “Great  Observatory”  Gops
crew size of 18 people during the steady-state phase.

The  steady-state  crew  levels,  both  Fops  and  Gops,  represent  the  staff  requirements  for  the
science-gathering  mission  of  the  TPF.    This  st ipulates  the  estimated  constant  technical
human  resource  level  for  the  required  mission  design  life  of  5  years.    However,  the  two
other mission phases, transit and checkout, have different staffing requirements.

The  transit phase  starts  at  launch  and  ends when  the  TPF  reaches  its  dest inat ion  orbit.   Due
to the  lack of science operations, and correspondingly  lower operational  tempo,  the  required
Fops and Gops staffing  levels will  be  less.   However  the operations  crew will  not operate  in
as  lean  a  manner  as  theoretically  possible,  due  to  the  practical  necessity  o f  retaining  a  core
of  qualified  operators  for  the  later  mission  phases  without  causing  programmat ically
difficult  large-scale personnel ramp-ups.   Therefore, the transit phase staffing  levels  for both
the  Fops  and  Gops  components  were  modeled  as  half  of  their  steady-state  science  phase
levels.

The  checkout  phase  fo llows  the  transit  phase  and  precedes  the  science  phase.    From  the
written TPF requirements,  it lasts 73 days.   The Fops and Gops crew sizes are  the same as  in
the  later science phase, but an  addit ional  staffing  component of  techexperts  is  added.   These
techexperts  provide  support  to  validate  the  proper  funct ionality  o f  each  TPF  subsystem.
Their number  is directly affected by the adjusted complexity value and  is defined by

Tradit ionally,  complexity  est imates  dictate  Fops  crew  sizes  and  and  skill  levels,  but  this
module  differentiates  between  them.    The  requisite  skill  level  does  not  depend  completely
on  the  adjusted  complexity,  but  rather  the  recovery  complexity  of  operational  hiccups  like
false  events  and  non-permanent  failures.    Therefore,  a more  trouble-prone  TPF  will  require
operators  with  a  higher  average  skill  level,  not  merely  more  operators.    For  example,  a
geostationary communicat ions satellite with a high event rate would require a  lower operator
skill  level  than  a  Pluto  flyby  mission  with  a  lower  event  rate  but  more  difficult  recovery
profile.    Assuming  advancements  in  automat ion  techno logy  during  the  intervening  years

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 121 of 175 

before  officia l  TPF  program  start,  all  false  events  were  modeled  as  transparent  to  the 
operations  crew,  because  of  ant icipated  low-cost,  mult iple-path  onboard  state  detection 
algorithms.    However,  non-permanent  failures  would  st ill  require  the  intervent ion  of  the 
operations  crew.    The  daily  rate  of  non-permanent  failures  found  by  summing  the  daily 
failure  rates  of  each  operations  function  represents  the  recovery  complexity  o f  a  TPF 
configuration.  This  recovery  complexity  determines  the  skill  level  of  the  Fops  crew. 
Differences  in skill  level can  cause  a  salary variat ion of up  to $10,000  for  a Fops  employee. 
Table 17 shows the salaries for the different operations personnel.

Knowing  the crew sizes  for the different operations groups,  their  respect ive  salaries,  and  the 
time  spent  in  each  operational  phase,  the  total  labor  cost  for  a  TPF  configurat ion  is 
calculated.  Figure 52 recaps the approach used to arrive at the  labor cost.

Development Cost Approach 
While  the  key  to  capturing  the  labor  cost  differences  between  TPF  architectures  lies  in  a 
quant ifiable  complexity  value,  the  development  cost  is  estimated  in  a  more  tradit ional 
manner.    The  module  arrives  at  this  cost  by  first  estimat ing  the  flight  and  ground  software

sizes.    It  then  est imates  the  ground  segment  development  cost  as  a  funct ion  of  the  ground 
software  cost  using  a  cost  estimating  relat ionship  (CER)  approach  from  “ Space  Mission 
Analys is and Design”  [Larson & Wertz, 1992]. 

The  flight  and  ground  software  size  est imates  attempt  to  account  for  the  differences  in 
required  software  for  alternate  TPF  configurat ions.    In  each  case  a  baseline  length  of  Ada 
source  lines  o f  code  (SLOC)  for  the  least  complex  TPF  configurat ion  is  harmonized  with 
one  from  a  “ Great Observatory”  c lass  astronomy mission.  Addit ional  spacecraft  add  flight 
software  length due to 1) new model introduction, and 2)  increased complexity o f safe mode 
logic  for  mult iple  vehicles.      For  ground  software,  the  length  increases  with  1)  new  model 
introduction,  and  2)  increased  data  filtering  and  archiving.    The  following  two  equations 
display the flight and ground software sizing est imates: 

Flight S/W SLOC = 40000 base + 20000 second platform +150N2 safing logic 

Ground S/W SLOC = 1000000 + 200000 second platform +500N2 filtering & archiving 

Equation 99 

Equation 100 

where N  is  the number of  addit ional  spacecraft.   Notice  that  the  software  size  increase  from 
a  second  plat form  is  only  a  fract ion  of  the  init ial  baseline.    This  results  from  the  relat ive 
simplicity o f the combiner spacecraft and some software re-use with the co llector  spacecraft. 
It  is  assumed  that  the  software  differences  between  combiner  spacecraft  of  different  sized 
apertures will be negligible. 

Maintenance Cost Approach 
Maintenance represents  the continual requirement  to  support  necessary operational elements 
over  the  course  of  the  TPF  mission.    Using  a  CER  from  [Larson  &  Wertz,  1992],  it  is 
modeled by 

Maintenance = 0.1 x (GSW+EQ+FAC) 

Equation 101 

where  GSW  is  the  ground  software  development  cost,  EQ  is  the  equipment  development 
cost, and FAC  is the facility development cost. 

Mission Inefficiency 
Three  main  components  affect  mission  inefficiency,  the  signal  delay  t ime,  the  operational 
failure  rate,  and  the  recovery  time  per  failure.  Figure  53  shows  the  mission  inefficiency 
contribution from a single anomaly.

In  Figure  53,  the  addit ional  mission  ineffic iency  from  an  acknowledgment  cycle  is  shown. 
This extra cycle, compr ised o f  two  transmission  cycles, will not  always  be  necessary,  and  is 
up  to  the  operator ’ s  judgement  or  established  operations  protocol.  The  average  number  of 
transmission  cycles,  assuming  an  equal  distr ibution  o f  required  and  acknowledgement 
cycles, is therefore 3. 

The  signal  delay  t ime  is  the  one-way  straight-line  communications  travel  time  between  the 
TPF and the ground station.  It is captured by 

D = S/c 

Equation 102 

where D  is  the  signal delay  t ime, S  is  the distance between  the TPF  and ground  station,  and 
c  is the vacuum speed of light. 

Failures of different operations  funct ions have different  average  failure recovery  times.   The 
breakdown is shown in Table 18.

Trade Space:
Operational  difficulty  leads  to  increased  cost  and  is  driven  by  system  complexity.    System
complexity  is  driven,  to  a  large  degree,  by  the  number  of  addit ional  spacecraft  to  control,
and  the  attendant  increase  in  difficulty  to  ensure  their  cooperative  funct ionality.    Therefore,
a  structurally  connected  spacecraft  is  easier  to  operate  than  a  small  cluster  of  separated
spacecraft,  which,  in  turn,  is  easier  to  operate  than  a  more  numerous  cluster  of  separated
spacecraft.    It  should  be  po inted  out  that operating  the  five  spacecraft  of  a  4  aperture SSI  is
not  four or  five  times  as  complex  as  a  single  spacecraft  SCI,  since  each  addit ional  collector
spacecraft  is  comparat ively  simple  with  respect  to  the  main  combiner  spacecraft.
Furthermore,  operational  efficiencies,  learning  curve  effects,  and  automat ion  attenuate  the
complexity  increase  from  each  addit ional  spacecraft.    The  operational  difficulty  trade  is
shown  in Figure 54.

Mission  inefficiency  impacts  system  performance  (primarily  imaging  rate)  and  is  affected 
by two  factors,  system unreliability and  distance.   A  less  complex  system will  generate  less 
anomalies,  requiring  less  t ime  to  resolve  those  anomalies.    A  closer  system  will  suffer  less 
transmission  delay  t ime.  Therefore,  a  close  and  reliable  system  reacts  quickly  to  relatively 
few anomalies, while a distant and unreliable system reacts slowly to frequent anomalies.

7.6  GINA Macro-Module 
The  final  macro-module  in  TMAS  is  the  systems  analysis  macro-module,  named  GINA. 
Recall  that  the  primary  object ive  of  this  project  was  to  “ Develop  a  methodology  for  the 
comparison  of  architectures,  spanning  from  structurally  connected  to  separated  spacecraft 
interferometers. ”  Therefore  a  need  exists  to  develop  a  uniform  framework  for  comparing 
different  TPF  architectures  on  the  same  basis.  The  systems  engineering  methodology 
chosen to  develop this  framework  is GINA  - the Generalized  Informat ion Network Analysis 
methodology for Distributed Satellite Systems [Shaw, 1998]. 

Figure  56  illustrates  the  order  in which  each  module  is  called  by  the  GINA  macro-module. 
First,  GINA  calls  the  Capability  module.    This  funct ion  reads  in  the  orbit,  the  number  of 
apertures,  the  signal-to-noise  ratio  (SNR),  the  spectral  reso lut ion  required  for  each  of  the 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 126 of 175 

three  modes  of  operation,  the  aperture  configuration  matrix,  the  dynamic  no ise  (OPD 
delays),  and  the  mission  inefficiency.    The  outputs  include  the  surveying,  medium 
spectroscopy,  and  deep  spectroscopy  imaging  rates.   Next,  GINA  calls  the  Performance 
module.    This  function  requires  the  total  number  of  apertures,  the  correct  Markov  Model, 
and  the  imaging  rate  in  each  of  the  three  modes  of  operations.  With  these  inputs,  the 
performance module est imates  the  total number of  images  the TPF will  take over  its mission 
lifet ime.  GINA then calls the Cost module, which requires the total number of apertures, the 
architecture type, the aperture diameters, the number of combiner payloads, the science  light 
beam  diameter,  the  total  bus  mass,  the  launch  cost,  and  the  operations  cost  as  inputs.    The 
Cost module  computes  the  system’ s  total  lifecycle  cost.   After  reading  in  the  total  lifecycle 
cost  and  the  mission  performance,  the  Cost  Per  Funct ion  module  calculates  the  cost  per 
image.    Finally,  the  adaptability module  may  be  used  to  calculate  the  sensit ivity  o f  the  cost 
per image to variat ions in different parameters.

7.6.1  Capability Module 
Module Motivation 
In  the GINA methodology,  the  capability o f  an  architecture  is  characterized  by  the  “ Quality 
of  Service”  par ameters  that  relate  to  the  detection  process  and  to  the  quantity,  quality,  and 
availability o f the  informat ion  that  is  processed  through  the  network.   These  parameters  are 
signal isolation,  informat ion rate,  informat ion integrity, and the availability of  these services 
over  time  [Shaw,  1998].    Once  formulated,  these  parameters  serve  as  the  minimum 
instantaneous capability requirements the system must meet to satisfy the customer. 

Module Description 
Isolat ion  refers  to  the  ability o f  a  system  to  iso late  and  distinguish  informat ion  signals  from 
different  sources within  the  field  o f  view.    For TPF,  the  system’ s  angular  resolut ion,  which 
is  a  funct ion  of  the  maximum  vector  baseline  between  a  pair  of  collectors,  determines  the 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­

Page 127 of 175 

smallest sized objects the SSI can image and discriminate between in the  field o f view.  Rate 
measures  the speed at which  the system  transfers  informat ion  between  the  sources  and  sinks 
in  the  network.  In TPF,  the  imaging  rate  is  simply  the  total  number  of  images  the  system 
can  produce  per  unit  time  and  varies  for  each  of  the  three  modes  of  operation  - surveying, 
imaging,  and  spectroscopy.    Integrity  is  a  measure  of  the  quality  o f  the  informat ion  being 
transferred through the network.  In the case of TPF, the  integrity o f an  individual image  is a 
funct ion of the SNR.
 TPF architectures with greater  integrity will produce  images with  less 
uncertainty.

informat ion symbo ls  are being  transferred  through  the  network between all o f the  sources 
and sinks.   For TPF, targets close  to the sun, or those whose  imaging vio lates  sun avo idance 
angles  within  the  optical  train,  reduce  the  availability  o f  the  system.    The  actual  imaging 
time versus calibration, retargeting, and other tasks also affect the availability o f the system. 

For  TPF,  the  iso lat ion  capability  (necessary  angular  resolut ion)  for  the  TPF  mission  is 
mandated  in the  requirements document.   All simulated  architectures meet  this  requirement, 
which  may  be  verified  by  looking  at  the  transmissivity  function.    Similarly,  the  minimum 
integrity (required SNR) needed for planetary detection  is also mandated  in the requirements 
document.  This  SNR,  combined  with  the  inputs  to  the  capability  module,  allows  for  the 
calculat ion  of  the  imaging  t ime  for  each  mode  of  operation  by  so lving  the  SNR  equation 
(Equation  116)  for  time  t.    The  inverse  of  t  yields  the  TPF  architecture  imaging  rate.   By 
calculat ing  this  imaging  rate  for  each  unique  functioning  state  of  the  TPF  and  passing  this 
informat ion  to  the  performance  module,  the  GINA  module  is  able  to  calculate  the  total 
number  of  images  the  architecture  will  co llect  over  it ’ s  mission  life,  taking  into  account 
failures.  Since  both iso lat ion and  integrity  are  set  in  the  requirements,  the  imaging  rate will 
be the distinguishing capability parameter between different TPF architectures. 

Recall  that  three  different  operational  modes  are  modeled  for  TPF  –  sur veying,  medium 
spectroscopy, and deep spectroscopy.   The surveying mode, which  requires  an SNR = 5  at  a 
spectral  reso lut ion  of  3,  entails  looking  for  planets  around  a  large  variety  of  stars.  The 
medium  spectroscopy  mode,  which  requires  an  SNR  =  10  at  a  spectral  reso lution  of  20, 
encompasses  looking for strong spectral lines o f mo lecules, such as CO2 and H2O, that  could 
indicate  the  presence  of  life  on  the  observed  planets.    Finally,  the  deep  spectroscopy  mode, 
which requires an SNR = 25 at a spectral resolut ion of 20, searches for O3 spectral lines. 

To compute  the  imaging rate of a TPF architecture,  the  total time  required  to obtain a  single 
image  must  be  calculated  for  each  mode  of  operation.    This  total  imaging  time  (TT)  is  the 
sum  of  the  integration  time  (Ti),  overhead  time  (To),  and  time  lost  due  to  mission 
inefficiency (Tm).

+ To

The  integration  time  for  the  different  spectroscopy  modes  is  driven  by  the  required  SNRs 
and  spectral  reso lut ions.    The  values  for  these  parameters  for  the  different  spectroscopy 
modes  are  direct ly  obtained  from  the  requirements  document  and  are  given  in  Table  19.

The fo llowing  inputs are required to compute integration time. 

•  The required SNR 
•  The spectral resolut ion 
•  The aperture configurat ion matrix 
•  The  interferometer ’ s operating orbit 
•  The wavelength of interest 

The  required  SNR  and  the  spectral  resolut ion  are  obtained  from  Table  19.    The  aperture 
configuration  matrix  is  the  N  x  6  output  matrix  produced  by  the  Aperture  Configurat ion 
Macro-Module.  The  interferometer ’ s  operating  orbit  is  obtained  direct ly  from  the  Design 
Vector, while the operating wavelength is set to 12 microns  in the Constants Vector. 

The  computation  determines  the  rate  at  which  photons  are  received  by  the  interferometer 
from  the different sources.  Using  these rates, the minimum integrat ion  time  required  for  the 
specified  SNR  and  spectral  resolut ion  can  then  be  determined.    The  fo llowing  sources 
contribute to the total photon count received by the  instrument. 

•  The planet 
•  The parent star leakage 
•  The local zodiacal cloud 
•  The exo-zodiacal cloud 
•  The background no ise 

A  noise  source  that  is  not  captured  is  the  dark  current  noise  caused  by  using  the  infrared 
detector. 

The phys ics behind  this module  is adapted from Appendix A  in  [Beichman  et  al., 1999]  and 
is best explained with an example.   In  the fo llowing discussion, the  integration  time required 
for the 1-2-2-1 OASES interferometer located at an orbit of 5 AU and operating  in the planet 
detection  mode  is  determined  by  calculat ing  the  photon  rate  received  from  the  different 
sources. 

The  target  planet  is  modeled  as  an  Earth-like  planet  located  10  parsec  away  from  the 
instrument,  which  is  consistent  with  the  assumptions  made  in  the  Aperture  Configurat ion 

macro-module.   Assuming also  that  the parent  star  is Sun-like,  the  temperature of  the planet
can be determined by Equat ion 105.

The  variable  a  is  the  orbital  radius  of  the  planet  and  L*  is  the  lumino sity  o f  the  parent  star
with  respect  to  the  Sun.    From  this  planet  temperature,  the  brightness  temperature  of  the

Q(r,q) is the transmissivity funct ion of the  interferometer, Wplanet is the solid angle subtended
by  the  planet,  the  product  AtelNtel  is  the  total  co llecting  area  of  the  interferometer,  h  is  the
optical  efficiency  o f  the  interferometer,  and  R  is  the  specified  spectral  reso lution,  which  is
equivalent  to  l/Dl.    The  optical  efficiency  o f  the  system  is  set  at  0.04,  as  quoted  in
[Beichman  et  al.,  1999].   Even  though  an  Earth-like  planet  located  at  1 AU  from  the  parent
star was  assumed,  the  average  response o f  the  transmissivity  function  in  the  ent ire  habitable
zone  (0.5  to  3 AU)  is  used  to  provide  a more  appropriate  estimat ion  of  the  expected  photon
rate.  The results of these calculat ions  indicate that the average photon rate from  the planet  is
0.1 photons/sec for the 1-2-2-1 interferometer operating  in the planet detection mode.

A  major  source  of  no ise  for  the  TPF  is  parent  starlight  leakage.    Since  the  parent  star  is
approximately  one  million  t imes  brighter  than  the  planet  at  the  wavelength  that  is  being
considered  (12  microns),  the  amount  of  starlight  that  leaks  through  may  be  sufficient  to
wreck the effort to detect the faint signal from the planet.

The rate of starlight coming through the null  is given by Equat ion 108.

The  brightness  temperature  of  the  parent  star  can  be  determined  by  assuming  a  constant
surface temperature of 5800 K.   The photon rate due to star  light  leakage, evaluated over the
parent star, is 6.2 x 10-7 photons/sec for the current example.

Another  important  noise  source  introduced  into  the  system  is  from  local  zodiacal  dust.   The
capability module uses the zodiacal cloud model proposed by [Reach et al., 1995], where  the

Equation 110, where r is the distance from the sun measured  in AU.

The different  parameters  that describe  the  zodiacal  cloud  in Equation 109  and Equation  110

Using  this  zodiacal  cloud  model,  the  signal  rate  from  the  local  zodiacal  cloud  can  then  be
determined  using  Equation  111,  where  the  integral  extends  to  the  edge  of  the  primary
telescope  beam,  rmax  =  0.66l/D.    According  to  [Beichman  et.  al.,  1999],  this  cho ice  o f  rmax
optimizes  the SNR  for  a  background-limited measurement of  a  point  source.    In  the  case  of
the  OASES  interferometer  located  at  an  orbit  of  5  AU,  the  signal  rate  due  to  the  local
zodiacal cloud  is 0.27 photons/sec.

The determinat ion of  the exo-zodiacal cloud photon count rate  is similar  to what  is shown  in
the previous sect ion.   Since no  information  is available  for the zodiacal cloud  in  the  targeted
systems, the same cloud model [Reach et al., 1995] is used again.  Therefore, the photon rate
the interferometer sees  is determined by Equat ion 112.

The  integral  extends  from  the  surface of  the parent  star  to  the  edge of  the primary  telescope
beam.    A  total  photon  count  rate  of  13  photons/sec  will  be  seen  by  the  OASES
interferometer.

Another noise source that  is  included  in  the  formulat ion  is  the background no ise.   This  error
comes  about  since  the planet must be detected  against  a non-flat  field of  corrugations  in  the
target  field.    The  flat  field  error  used  in  this  formulat ion  is  f  =  10-5,  while  the  flat  field
photon rate  is calculated from Equation 113, where  the dark  current  rate  is discussed below.
For this OASES example, the flat field photon rate is 1.8 x 10 -9 photons/sec.

The  last noise source considered  in this module  is  the detector dark current noise.   The value
for  this  source  was  obtained  from  [Beichman  et.  al.,  1999]  and  is  est imated  to  be  5

The  total  noise  is  the  quadratic  sum  o f  all  the  individual  components  and  is  given  by

In  addit ion  to  physics,  the  TPF  imaging  time  calculat ions  must  also  consider  operations 
issues such as overhead  t ime and operations downtime.   Overhead  t ime  for an observat ion  is 
the  time  allotted  for  constellat ion  slewing,  aperture  configuration,  array  rotation,  etc.  JPL 
estimates this overhead t ime as 6 hours for each survey and 5.33 hours for every 24 hours of 
spectroscopy [Beichman et.  al., 1999].  The  time  lost  to mission  inefficiency  is  computed  in 
the operations module  and  is  a  funct ion of  the  total number of  spacecraft  in  the  system.  An 
architecture  that  contains  more  spacecraft  is  inherent ly  more  complex  to  control,  and  will 
therefore  lose more  imaging  time  due  to  the  resolution  o f  anomalies.    Table  22  summarizes 
the three elements that go into the  imaging time calculat ion for each mode of operation.

Finally, once the total imaging t ime has been computed for a mode of operation,  the  imaging 
rate (Ci) in that mode may be determined by inverting the total imaging time.

Equation 117 

This  imaging  rate  must  be  computed  for  each  mode  of  operation  for  each  possible 
operational  state  of  the  interferometer,  taking  into  account  failures.    For  example,  a  six 
collector  nulling  interferometer  may  funct ion  with  all  six  co llectors  operational  (State  1), 
five  operational  co llectors  after  a  single  failure  (State  2),  and  four  operational  co llectors 
after  two  failures  (State  3).   Table  23  lists  these  imaging  rates  for  both  SCI  and  SSI  TPF 
architectures.  Both architectures contain six co llectors, two meters in diameter each, and are 
located  in a 1 AU orbit.  While both architectures have  the  same  imaging  rate  in State 1,  the 
SSI maintains a higher  imaging rate  in  the degraded  states.  This  is  because  the  collectors  in 
an SSI  may  be  reconfigured  to  new  “ optimal”   positions  after  a  failure,  while  the  co llectors 
on an SCI are fixed  in sub-optimal posit ions after one or more failures.

7.6.2  Performance Module
Module Motivation
While  the  capability module  calculates metrics  such  as  the  imaging  rate of  each  operational
mode  at  any  po int  in  time,  the  performance  module  calculates  how  well  these  metrics  are
satisfied  over  the  mission  lifet ime.    For  the  TPF,  performance  is  expressed  as  the  total
number of  images  the  system  produces over  the mission design  life.   However,    to  calculate
this  quant ity,  the  addit ional  complicat ion  of  taking  into  account  all  o f  the  possible  failures
that may occur within the system must be addressed.   As  individual co llectors fail over  time,
the  imaging  rate of  the  system will  decrease  in  order  to  maintain  the  same  pre-failure  level
of  integrity (ie.  the TPF must still  achieve  the  same SNR  for  each operational mode, despite
failures).

Module Description
The Performance Module uses Markov reliability modeling techniques  to determine both the
probability  that  the  system  will  cont inue  to  funct ion  over  a  given  amount  of  time  and  the
likelihood with which  the  system will  funct ion  in  different  partially  failed  states  throughout
the  mission.    A  Markov  model  must  be  created  for  each  proposed  architecture.    From  the
Markov  model,  a  system  of  different ial  equat ions  is  developed,  as  shown  in  Equation  118,
r
where  &P   is  the  time  rate of  change  of  the  state  probability  vector,  A  is  the  state  coefficient
r  is the state probability vector.
matrix comprised of component failure rates, and  P

&P = AP

Equation 118

The  so lution  to  this  set of  linear  first order,  partially  coupled  ordinary  different ial  equations
determines  the  probability  o f  the  system  being  in  any  given  state  at  a  particular  time.
Coupling  the  outputs of  the  reliability model with  the outputs of  the  capability model  yields
the  total  performance  (total  number  of  images)  of  the  system.    The  coupling  equat ion  is
called the utility funct ion (Equation 119).

T n
E (T ) = (cid:242) (cid:229) Ci Pi ( t )dt
0 i =1

Equation 119

E  is  the  total  number  of  images,  T  is  the  mission  lifet ime,  n  is  the  total  number  of
operational states, C is  the capability  in each state  i, and P  is  the probability of being  in each
operational state i as a function of t ime t.

This  sect ion  presents  an  example  of  how  to  create  a  Markov  model  for  a  TPF  architecture
and  how  to  apply  this  informat ion  to  the design of  the  system  architecture.   Markov  models
have been tradit ionally used to evaluate the reliability of complex systems.   In order to apply
a  Markov  modeling  methodology,  the  states  of  the  system  must  be  time  dependent,

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 134 of 175 

sequent ial,  and mutually  exclusive.    If  the  system  sat isfies  these  requirements,  then  a  set  of 
different ial  equat ions  can  be  written  to  model  the  evo lut ion  of  the  system.    By  taking 
advantage  of  the  Markov  property,  which  states  that  given  full  knowledge  of  the  current 
state  of  the  system,  one  can  predict  all  future  states  by  integrating  the  set  of  different ial 
equations,  irrespect ive of  the past  states of  the  system  [Gelb,  1974].  The  example  creates  a 
Markov model for the case of an eight collector nulling  interferometer.  The Markov models 
for architectures with 4 to 12 collectors were implemented  in the same manner. 

The first step is to develop a fault tree diagram illustrating all the possible different modes of 
failure  for  each  design  (Figure  57).    Recall  that  the  minimum  functionality  required  for  a 
nulling  interferometer  is  one  combiner  and  four  collectors.  Thus,  the  eight  collector  TPF 
architecture fails when the combiner  fails or when any five co llectors fail.

Figure 57.  Fault Tree for an Eight Collector TPF Architecture 

From  the  fault  trees,  a  Markov  model  illustrating  each  possible  state  of  the  system  may  be 
created  for  each  architecture.  Figure 58  illustrates  the Markov model  for  the  eight  collector 
architecture.  This  model  contains  five  possible  funct ioning  states,  which  all  require  a 
funct ional combiner. 

•  State 1:  All eight collectors are working. 
•  State 2:  Seven of the eight collectors are working. 
•  State 3:  Six of the eight collectors are working. 
•  State 4:  Five of the eight collectors are working. 
•  State 5:  Four of the eight collectors are working. 

Otherwise,  the system  is  in a  state of  failure  since  the nulling  (iso lation)  requirement  can no 
longer be met.

Figure 58.  Markov Model State Diagram for the 8 Collector TPF Architecture

From  the Markov  model  state  diagram,  a  system  of  different ial  equations  can  be  written  to
determine  the  probability  of  the  system  being  in  any  given  state  at  any  given  time.    This  is
done  by  represent ing  each  possible  state of  the  system  in  the  Markov  model  as  a  node  in  a
network.   To determine  the  different ial  equat ion  for  a  particular  state,  the  flow  into  and out
of the node representing  that state  is balanced.   The eight collector TPF architecture requires
a  set  of  five  partially  coupled  linear  first  order  different ial  equat ions  to  model  the  system
(Equation 120).

Equation 120

Knowledge  o f  the  failure  rates  for  the  combiner  (lcom)  and  collector  (lcol)  are  required  to
solve  for  the  state probabilit ies.   For  this work,  it was  assumed  that  a  combiner has  a mean-
time-to-failure (mttf) of 10 years and a collector has an mttf of 15 years.   The  failure rate (l)
is the  inverse of the mttf (Equation 121).

The  system’s  init ial  condit ions  are  also  required  for  the  solut ion.    In  every  case,  the  init ial
condit ions  (ie.  at  t=0  in  the  beginning of  the operational  mission)  are  a  100%  probability  o f
being  in state 1 and a 0% probability o f being  in all successive states.

The  plot  in  Figure  59  illustrates  the  results  for  the  eight  collector  example.    The  Markov 
model gives  the  exact probability o f being  in  any of  the  five operational  states  as  a  funct ion 
of time  through the  five year  (60 month) TPF mission.   Each of  these  five operational  states 
will have  a different  imaging  rate.  Markov models  for TPF  architectures  containing  four  to 
twelve  co llectors were  created  and  solved with  the  same  assumed  failure  rates.   The  results 
(state  probability  matrices)  were  saved  in  Mat lab  “ .mat ”   files.    The  TMAS  software  calls 
and  loads the appropriate  “ .mat ”  file based on the number of co llectors entered  in  the Design 
vector.

The  total  system  performance  of  a  TPF  configurat ion  can  now  be  calculated  using  the 
imaging  rate  (C)  in  each  operational  mode  in  each  possible  funct ioning  state  (capability 
module)  and  the  probability  o f  being  in  each  possible  functioning  state  over  the  mission 
lifet ime (Markov model). 

Table  24  lists  JPL’ s  scient ific  ut ilizat ion  plan  for  TPF.   With  this  utilizat ion  plan  as  the 
basis,  a  daily  TPF  mission  profile  (Table  25)  was  created  using  the  fo llowing  two 
assumpt ions: 

1.  	 During  each  year,  each  phase  is  executed  sequent ially.    For  example,  in  year  one  all  o f 
the surveys must be completed before beginning the medium spectroscopy,  and all of the 
medium  spectroscopy must  be  completed  before  beginning  the  deep  spectroscopy.    This 
simplifies the modeling process. 
2.  	 The  time  allocated by  JPL  to  “ astrophysical  imaging”  is  shared  evenly between medium 
and deep spectroscopy, since astrophysical imaging  is not modeled  in the TMAS.

The  total  number of  images a TPF architecture produces  is  the sum o f  the number of  images
it  produces  in  each  operational  mode  each  year.    Using  the  mission  profile  in  Table  25  for
the  limits o f  integration  (the  time  step  is  one  day),  the  total  system  performance  is  obtained
by  summing  fifteen  separate utility  funct ions  (Equation  122), where  i  is  an  index  indicat ing
a  particular  operational  state,  n  is  the  total  number  of  operational  states,  Cs  is  the  survey

7.6.3  Cost Module 
Module Motivation 
The  cost  module  est imates  the  total  TPF  architecture  lifecycle  cost  by  summing  the 
computed payload, bus,  launch, and operations costs. 

Module Description 
The  combiner  payload  cost  (Ccom)  is  computed  in  millions  of  U.S.  dollars  as  a  funct ion  of 
the  diameter  (Dcom)  of  the  science  light  entering  the  combiner  instrument  (0.2  m  for  TPF) 
[Larson and Wertz, 1992].

Based  on  the  projected mirror  costs  for  the Next Generation  Space  Telescope,  the  collector 
payload  costs  (Ccol) were estimated  in millions  of U.S.  dollars  as  a  funct ion  of  the  collector 
diameter (Dcol). 

Ccol  = (0.7243)Dcol 
2.69 

Equation 124 

The spacecraft bus cost model est imates  the  total cost  invo lved  in designing,  manufacturing, 
integrat ing,  and  testing  each  spacecraft  bus.    This  cost will  generally  be  proportional  to  the 
mass,  power,  and  other  subsystem  requirements  of  the  spacecraft.    Over  the  years,  several 
governmental organizat ions have  created Cost Estimat ion Relat ionships  (CERs)  for  satellite 
buses  that  show  how  the  cost  properties  of  a  spacecraft  bus  vary  with  the  subsystem 
parameters  of  the  bus.    These  CERs  are  based  on  the  historical  data  of  past  satellite 
programs and work on the assumpt ion that future costs will reflect historical trends. 

The  two  most  commonly  used  CERs  are  the  U.S.  Air  Force’ s  Unmanned  Spacecraft  Cost 
Model (USCM)  and  the Aerospace Corporation’ s Small Satellite Cost Model  (SSCM).  The 
SSCM  is valid for satellites approximately 500 kg or less and  is based on 1990’ s  techno logy. 
The USCM database contains much  larger satellites, but  is based on older 1970’ s and 1980’ s 
techno logy [Bearden, 1998]. 

The original  intent ion was to use several o f  the CERs  from  the SSCM, and  then compute  the 
theoretical  first  unit  (TFU)  cost  of  each  spacecraft  bus  via  a  weighted  average  algorithm. 
However,  it  soon  became  apparent  that  the  bus  masses  for  TPF  would  greatly  exceed  500 
kg.  Therefore a mass  (M) CER  from  the USCM was used  to  compute  the TFU  cost  of  each 
spacecraft bus (Cbus) in millions of U.S. dollars [Larson and Wertz, 1992]. 

Cbus  = (0.185)M 0.77 

Equation 125 

The  launch  cost  is  strict ly  a  function  o f  the  launch  vehicle  selected  to  deploy  the  TPF 
architecture.   Table  26  lists  the  vehicles  considered  in  the  launch  vehicle  module  and  their 

associated  costs.   If  a  particular  TPF  architecture  requires  a  larger  launch  vehicle  than 
currently exists, the module automat ically declares the  launch cost to be $300 million.

Finally, the TPF architecture operations costs are computed directly  in the operations macro-
module.  The  total  operations  cost  is  comprised  of  ground  system  development  and 
maintenance costs, transit operations costs, on-station checkout costs, and science operations 
costs.   These  costs  also  scale  with  the  complexity  of  the  particular  TPF  architecture  as 
explained  in the Operat ions Macro-module sect ion. 

The total lifecycle cost (Clifecycle) is calculated from Equation 126. 
Clifecycle  = C payload  + Cbus  + Claunch  + Coperations 

Equation 126 

Cpayload  is  the  sum of  all  the  combiner  and  co llector  payload  costs,  Cbus  is  the  sum  o f  all  the 
bus costs, Claunch is the total launch cost, and Coperations is the total operations cost.

The Adaptability Module  (Section 7.6.5) provides  the  capability  to perform a wide  range  of 
trade studies and sensit ivity analyses. 

7.6.4  Cost per Function Module 
Module Motivation 
The Cost Per Function  (CPF) metric provides  a  clear  measure  of  the  cost  of  an  architecture 
versus  its  performance.    It  is  a  measure  of  the  cost  to  achieve  a  common  level  of 
performance and  includes expected development, launch, and operations costs. 

Module Description 
For  the  TPF,  the  cost  per  funct ion  is  defined  as  the  cost  per  image  (CPI),  and  is  calculated 
by dividing  the  total number of images obtained by  the  interferometer  into the  total  lifecycle 
cost.

• 	 As  the  system  design  trade-space  is  explored,  the  CPI  may  be  used  as  one  metric  to 
determine the relat ive performance of compet ing TPF system architectures. 

Trade Space 
The CPI metric provides a mechanism for evaluat ing the fo llowing design trades. 

• 	 Orbit:    Placing  the  TPF  farther  from  the  sun  increases  the  imaging  rate  as  the 
interferometer looks through less of the  local zodiacal cloud, thus  improving  total system 
performance.    However,  placing  TPF  further  away  costs  more  since  a  larger,  more 
expensive  launch vehicle  is required to deploy the system.  Which orbit  provides the best 
balance? 

• 	 Number  of  Collector  Apertures: 
Increasing  the  number  of  apertures  improves  the 
system  performance  by  increasing  the  total  co llect ing  area,  increasing  system  reliability, 
and  allowing  for  fine-tuning  of  the  null.    However,  more  apertures  also  increases  the 
construction,  testing,  launch,  and operations  costs.   Which number of  apertures provides 
the best balance? 

• 	 Architecture  Type:  SCI  architectures  tend  to  have  a  lower  total  mass  and  are  thus 
cheaper  to  launch,  but  SSI  architectures  tend  to  provide  better  performance  due  to  their 
reconfiguration capability.  Which one provides the best value for the TPF mission? 

• 	 Aperture  Collector  Diameter:   Larger  apertures  provide  better  images,  but  also  cost 
more.  What size provides the best balance? 

7.6.5  Adaptability Module 
Module Motivation: 
In GINA, adaptability  is a measure of how  flexible  an  architecture  is  in  response  to  changes 
in design assumpt ions and mission  requirements.    In one  sense,  adaptability may be  thought 
of  as  the  sensit ivity  or  elast icity  o f  the  cost  per  funct ion  of  a  particular  architecture  to 
incremental  changes  in  an  assumpt ion  or  requirement.   For  the  TPF  mission,  potential 
assumpt ions  that  could  be  altered  to  measure  architecture  sensit ivity  include  component 
costs  and  component  reliabilit ies.    In  another  sense,  adaptability  may  be  thought  of  as  the 
flexibility  of  a  particular  architecture  to  adapt  to  a  new  set  of mission  requirements,  such  as 
a  longer  mission  design  life.  An  example  of  flexibility  for  TPF  might  be  the  ability  o f  an 
SSI  architecture  to  transit ion  from  a  planetary  detection  mission  to  a    mission  of 
astrophysical imaging.  This latter interpretation of adaptability is not modeled by TMAS.

A  sensit ivity  analysis  measures  how  a  change  in  a  single  architecture  assumpt ion  or 
requirement  affects  the  entire  system  “ performance” 
in  terms  of  the  system  metrics. 
Sensit ivity analyses are conducted because,  in reality, point design do not remain frozen, but 
evo lve  over  time.    This  occurs  because  the  actual  values  for  the  architecture  variables 
(Constants  Vector)  used  in  the  implementation  o f  a  design  will  be  different  from  the 
theoretical  values  used  during  the  conceptual  design  phase  of  the  project.  A  sensit ivity 
analys is allows  the user  to  assess  ahead of  time  how  such  changes will  affect  the  capability, 
reliability, and cost of  the system; and whether or not such variat ions will change  the  choice 
of the  “b est ”  architecture. 

Module Description: 
The  adaptability metric  is defined  as  the  sensit ivity,  or  elast icity,  o f  the  cost  per  funct ion  of 
an  architecture  to  incremental  changes  in  a  particular  design  parameter.   Elast icity  is  a  tool 
commonly used  in  the  field of economics  to determine  the responsiveness of  the demand  for 
a  product  to  a  change  in  price  of  the  product  [McEachern,  1994].  For  TPF,  elasticity  (E) 
may be  thought  of  as  the  responsiveness of  the  cost per  image of  a particular  architecture  to 
a change  in value o f an architecture design parameter (x). 

E x  =  CPI / CPI 
x / x 

Equation 128 

Because  TPF  is  a  large,  complex,  non-linear  design  problem  with  many  design  variables, 
finite  differencing  is  the  only  way  to  calculate  the  sensit ivity  o f  the  CPI  to  the  design 
parameter(s)  of  interest.  Thus,  the  simulation  must  be  re-run  for  each  parameter  to  which 
the sensit ivity will be calculated.   After obtaining  the  new CPI,  the sensit ivity or elast icity  is 
calculated by Equation 128. 

The  process  for  evaluat ing  the CPI  sensit ivity  of  a  particular  architecture  to  the  diameter  of 
the  truss  members  can  be  illustrated  by  an  example.    The  architecture  selected  for  this 
example  is  a  four  aperture  linear  symmetric  SCI  in  a  1  AU  orbit  with  2  meter  diameter 
apertures.   With  the  truss  member  diameter  default  value  of  2  cm,  the  system  has  a  CPI  of 
$1.00  million.    If  the  truss  member  diameter  is  changed  to  3  cm,  the  system  CPI  is  1.05 
million.  Thus,  the  elast icity o f  the CPI  to  the  truss member diameter  is 0.122, meaning  that 
the  total system  value  is  relat ively  insensit ive  to  a  small  change  in  the  diameter  of  the  truss 
members.  In  this  manner,  the  sensit ivity  o f  any  TPF  architecture  may  be  computed  for 
many different design parameters. 

Trade Space: 
The  Adaptability  Module  is  the  tool  with  which  many  o f  the  possible  trade  studies  can  be 
executed.

8.0  Architectural Design Evaluation Results 
This  Chapter  demonstrates  the  results  we  obtained  from  exploring  the  trade  space  with  the 
TPF  mission  analysis  software  (TMAS).  First,  the  TRW,  Lockheed  Martin,  and  Ball 
Aerospace  benchmark  cases  used  to  determine  the  quality  of  TMAS  are  presented.    Next 
come the actual  trade study results.   We did  not have  t ime  to complete a full  test matrix, and 
thus  a  single  optimal  design  was  not  found.    Rather,  we  chose  to  explore  each  axis  of  the 
design vector  independent ly,  and  thus  the  trades  are made  between  the  entries  of  the  design 
vector and our capability metrics. A useful metric  for comparing  very different  architectures 
is  the  cost per  image  (CPI) metric,  assuming  that  all  images  (i.e.  surveys)  meet  the  required 
SNR and nulling requirements (ie. the integrity and  iso lat ion requirements).  Important trends 
have  become  visible  and  the  first  indicat ions  of  “ optimal”   design  corners  are  becoming 
apparent.  These  are  illustrated  in  the  two  combined  cases  presented  at  the  end  of  this 
Chapter. 

8.1  Benchmark Configuration Results 
Before  the  TMAS  so ftware  can  be  used  to  explore  the  tradespace  for  TPF,  a  series  of  test 
cases  need  to  be  conducted  to  ensure  that  the  end  results  are within  reason.   A  total  of  four 
test  cases,  corresponding  to  the  TPF  designs  by  Ball,  TRW,  and  Lockheed  Martin,  were 
examined  to  create  mult iple  benchmark  comparisons  for  the  TMAS  software.  The  results 
from  TMAS  were  compared  to  the  TPF  system  parameters  from  each  po int  design  to  see 
which  est imates had  significant differences,  and  to  explain  the  reason why  these differences 
exist.  The  overall  goal  in  this  benchmarking  process  was  to  gain  confidence  in  the  results 
from TMAS, not to match them with the design parameters from other companies. 

The  first  benchmark  test  case  concerns  the  TPF  design  by  the  Ball  Aerospace  and 
Techno logies Corporation.  An illustration of their TPF design is given in Figure 60.

power  estimates  for  the Ball design  are  listed with  the  same  est imates  from TMAS  in  Table

Different power estimates 
(payload, thermal, etc.) 

The  notable  differences  in  this  case  concern  the  communications,  thermal,  power,  and 
propulsion/propellant estimates.  The communicat ions subsystem mass  from TMAS  is  lower 
that  the  Ball  est imate  because  the  TMAS  code  specifically  attempts  to  limit  this  subsystem 
mass by providing  it with more power.  The power  subsystem discrepancy  is mainly  caused 
by  the  different  power  demand  est imates  but  is  also  affected  by  the  chosen  power  source. 
However,  the  most  significant  differences  between  the  TMAS  and  Ball  est imates  concern 
the  thermal  and  propulsion  subsystems.    The  thermal  subsystem  used  in  the  Ball  design 
almost  exclusively  employs  passive  cooling  strategies  in  the  form  o f  sun  shields,  whose 
mass  is  included  in  the  structural  mass  est imate.  The  TMAS  thermal  module  uses  a 
combinat ion  of  sun  shields  and  cryocoolers  to  size  the  thermal  subsystem,  causing  it  to 
estimate  a greater total mass.   The discrepancy  in  the  est imate  for  the  propulsion  subsystem 
is  due  to  the  fact  the  Ball  design  includes  an  addit ional  thruster  with  propellant  that  would 
be  used  to  travel  to  the  mission  orbit.   The  TMAS  propulsion  neglected  this  consideration, 
so  the transfer propulsion system mass has been removed  from  the Ball est imates  to  account 
for  the  modeling  differences.    The  important  results  from  this  benchmark  concern  the  total 
mass  comparisons  between  the  Ball  and  TMAS  estimates.    For  the  most  part,  the  TMAS 
estimates  are  reasonably  similar  to  those  from  Ball,  making  this  a  successful  test  of  the 
TMAS software. 

The  next  test  cases  compare  the  TMAS  software  with  the  TRW  TPF  designs.    Figure  61 
gives an illustration of the TRW structurally connected design for TPF.

In  this  case,  the  major  discrepancies  between  the  TRW  and  TMAS  est imates  concern  the 
spacecraft  structure  and  the  power  and  propulsion  subsystems.    The  main  reason  for  these 
differences  is  that  the  TRW  design  attempts  to  minimize  mass  using  an  ultra  lightweight 
truss  and  lightweight  solar  concentrators.  The  TMAS  modules  account  for  certain 
techno logical advances, but do not reach the same level as TRW.  In addit ion,  the propulsion 
subsystem  in  the  TRW  design  accounts  for  the  transfer  requirement  similar  to  the  Ball 
design  while  the  TMAS  so ftware  does  not  consider  this  requirement.  Overall,  the 
comparison  of  the  total mass  and  power  estimates  again  supports  the  validity  o f  the  results 
from the TMAS so ftware.  The TPF trade study by TRW also includes the analys is of an SSI 
architecture.  Table 29  lists the mass and power estimates for TRW and TMAS.

Drastically different power

This  test  case  shows  a  greater  number  of  significant  discrepancies  between  the  TRW  and 
TMAS  est imates.  The  most  important  reason  for  this  is  the  drastic  difference  between  the 
two  power  demand  est imates.    The  TMAS  software  incorporates  an  electric  propulsion 
subsystem  for  an  SSI  architecture  which  requires  a  significant  level  o f  power  to  operate 
properly.    Even  with  these  different  design  assumpt ions  between  TRW  and  TMAS,  the 
overall  spacecraft mass  est imates  are  again  reasonably  close  to prove  that  the TMAS  results 
are logical. 

The  final benchmark  test  case  concerns  the TPF  study  conducted by Lockheed Mart in.   The 
Lockheed  Mart in  design  is  a  structurally  connected  interferometer  with  four  apertures 
located  at  1  AU.  The  comparisons  of  the  mass,  power,  and  cost  estimates  between  the 
Lockheed Mart in and TMAS designs are given in Table 30.

This  is the only  test case that provides an explicit cost estimate  for TPF, which  is quite close 
to  the  total  cost  calculated  in  the  TMAS  program.    Aside  from  the  total  cost  estimate,  the 
remainder of  the Lockheed Martin analys is  is not  a useful benchmark  because  the Lockheed 
Martin  design  makes  only  a  rough  approximat ion  of  the  total  mass  and  power  demand  for

PF  while  the  TMAS  so ftware  models  each  component  of  the  ent ire  spacecraft  in  greater 
detail.    Once  again,  the  TMAS  so ftware  successfully  benchmarks  against  the  TPF  design 
from another company. 

Overall,  the  benchmark  test  cases  proved  the  validity  of  the  TMAS  software  and  gave  us 
confidence  in  its results.   The benchmark cases specifically concentrated on mass and power 
estimates  because  the  Ball,  TRW,  and  Lockheed  Mart in  team  did  not  conduct  a  detailed 
analys is  of  the  trade  space  available  to  TPF.   These  companies  were  more  interested  in 
constructing  a  point  design  for  TPF  and  evaluat ing  its  performance.    The  TMAS  software 
takes  a  different  approach  by  focusing  on  the  trade  space  analysis  rather  than  specifying  a 
specific  design  for  TPF.   Now  that  the  TMAS  software  has  been  successfully  tested,  a 
detailed exploration o f the TPF trade space can be conducted. 

8.2  Trade Study Results 
The  key  object ive  of  this  project  is  to  develop  a  framework  in  which  the  trade  studies 
between  different  architecture  designs  can  be  conducted.
  Taking  a  first  step  towards 
achieving  this  object ive,  the  team  decided  upon  a  test  matrix  where  the  results  from  the 
different cases can be compared when only one parameter in the Design Vector is varied at  a 
time.    In  doing  so,  we  are  able  to  determine  the  trends  by  which  certain  parameters  (cost, 
mass,  etc.)  change  as  a  function  o f  only  one  parameter.   Even  though,  given  enough  time 
and  comput ing  power,  we  could  have  performed  an  exhaust ive  search  for  the  “ optimal” 
solut ion  based  upon  the  metric we  chose  to  compare,  understanding  these  single  dimension 
trends  gave  us  considerable  insight  as  to  what  the  sensit ive  parameters  are  and  at  the  same 
time,  confidence  in  our  model.    An  exhaust ive  search  of  the  trade  space  should  only  be 
performed  once  these  key  trades  are  understood.   Based  upon  these  results,  it  may  be 
possible to reduce the search space from the  large number of designs. 

In order to  compare  the different  test  cases,  the  team has  chosen  two  architectures  (SCI  and 
SSI) as baseline cases  to which results  from  the other cases could  be compared.   The Design 
Vector  parameters  for  these  two  baseline  cases  are  listed  in  Table  31.    Table  32  lists  the 
range over which each parameter is varied  in the trade studies.

8.2.1  Orbit Trade Study 
The  orbital  trade  study  was  conducted  on  both  an  SCI  and  an  SSI  of  the  fo llowing 
configuration:  4 apertures, 2 meters diameter each,  linear symmetric arrangement. 

Image Distribution vs. Orbit 
At orbits closer  to the sun,  the number of  images  is  limited by  the  lower SNR  caused by  the 
local  zodiacal  dust.  In  these  orbits,  the  density  o f  the  dust  relative  to  the  light  gathering 
power of the 2 meter collectors causes  the  integration  time  to be  longer  for each  image.   The 
plateau  at  approximately  1200  images  represents  the  maximum  number  of  images  for  this 
configuration  based  on  factors  other  than  orbit,  such  as  instrument  theoretical  capabilit ies 
and other noise sources.  For the same aperture configurat ions, the  total number of images as 
a function of orbit  is independent of whether the spacecraft is SCI or SSI.

Cost Distribution vs. Orbit 
As  the  orbital  radius  increases,  the  most  sizable  increases  in  cost  are  due  to  launch  vehicle 
select ion.    Both  the  mass  o f  the  spacecraft  and  the  V  requirements  increase  as  the  orbit

increases,  but  it  is  the  V  requirement  that  drives  the  cost  increases  in  the  SCI  case.  (See 
the next section for more information on the mass trade.) 

Development  and payload  costs do not  show  any dependence  on  orbit,  while  spacecraft  bus 
and  operations  costs  show  the  expected  increases  with  higher  orbits,  primarily  due  to  the 
longer mission  lifet ime.

separate  spacecraft  require  a  large  amount  of  power  relat ive  to  the  rest  of  the  spacecraft 
instruments  to  operate  efficient ly.  Thus,  as  the  orbit  increases,  the  size  of  the  solar  arrays 
required to provide this amount of power will grow until  the TMAS determines  that an RTG 
of  an  equivalent  or  smaller  mass  can  provide  the  necessary  power.  Propellant mass  showed 
only  a  slight  increase with  orbit,  indicat ing  that  rather  than  increasing  propellant  mass,  it  is 
more  efficient  to  increase  the  power  required  by  the  propulsion  system  and  to  take  the mass 
increase  in the power system. 

The payload mass  is not  a  funct ion of orbit by  the definit ion of  this  test  case.  The  effect of 
orbit  on bus  mass  is  relatively  small.    In general,  there  is  a  slight posit ive  correlat ion, but  at 
the  transit ion  from  so lar  arrays  to  RTGs,  there  is  a more  noticeable  jump  due  to  the  loss  of 
the solar arrays as a  layer  in the passive cooling scheme.

Total Mass vs. Orbit by Architecture 
The difference  is due  to  the greater total bus mass  associated with  the mult iple  spacecraft  in 
the SSI  case.   Not only  do  the mult iple  spacecraft  require  a  greater  init ial mass,  but  the  rate 
of  increase  with  orbit  is  also  greater  due  to  the  higher  power  requirements  of  the  mult iple 
propulsion  systems.    The  dip  in  the  graphs  at  2.5  AU  is  due  to  a  change  in  the  thermal 
control scheme result ing  from the  lower solar heat flux.

Cost per Image (CPI) vs. Orbit 
The  total  cost  per  image  tends  to  increase  at  both  ends  of  the  orbital  range,  indicat ing  that 
the  optimum  orbit  (for  the  selected  architecture)  is  within  our  range  of  consideration. 
However,  one  factor  not  included  in  the  TMAS  is  an  explicit  evaluat ion  of  the  potential 
effects of placing the TPF in the asteroid belt between 2.2 and 3.3 AU. 

For  low  orbits,  the  higher  CPI  is  largely  due  to  the  lower  number  of  total  images.    As 
previously  discussed,  the  lower  number  of  images  is  due  to  the  higher  density  o f  the  local 
zodiacal dust that drives a  longer  integration time for each image. 

For  high  orbits,  the  higher  CPI  is  largely  due  to  higher  launch  costs.  As  ment ioned 
previously,  the  higher  launch  costs  are  driven  by  the  increased  mass  and  Delta  V 
requirements for the higher orbits. 

The  higher  CPI  of  the  SSI  relat ive  to  the  SCI  is  primarily  due  to  the  greater  total  mass 
(higher  launch costs) and to higher  init ial development  costs.  The development  costs for the 
SSI case are higher due to the need to design (at least) two different  spacecraft  (collector and 
combiner) and to purchase more control system equipment rather than structural materials.

SCI Image Distribution 
The  first  plot  shows  the  number  of  images  increases  with  the  number  of  apertures.  The 
increase  is  most  significant  when  the  number  of  apertures  increases  from  four  to  six. 
Besides  producing  better  transmissivity  funct ions  (deeper  and  wider  nulls)  with  higher 
number of apertures, this significant  jump  is seen mainly due  to  the assumpt ions made  in  the 
Markov  model.    In  the  Markov  model,  we  assumed  total  mission  failure  will  occur  when 
there are  less  than  four operational apertures.   Hence,  in  the  four  aperture case,  the  expected 
number of images that can be obtained  is lower since this design cannot tolerate any failures. 
However,  as  higher  numbers  of apertures  are  used,  we  do  not  lose  the  entire  mission  when 
some of its apertures fail as  long as there are at least  four operational apertures.

The  plot  of  the  interferometer ’ s  mass  as  a  funct ion  of  the  number  of  apertures  shows  the 
linear dependence of the total mass against  the number of apertures.   In all cases,  the bulk of 
the interferometer ’ s total mass  is dominated by its dry mass, of which more  than 50% of it  is 
the  structural mass.    On  the  other  hand,  the  contribut ion  of  the  propellant  mass  to  the  total 
mass  is small.

SCI Cost Distribution 
The  total  lifecycle  cost  for  the  SCI  designs  increases  with  the  number  of  apertures  in  the 
design.  Both  the development  and  the operations  costs  for  this  architecture  remain  constant 
since  there  is  only  one  structure.    As  the  number  of  apertures  is  increased,  larger  launch 
vehicles are required.   In the case of 4 apertures, a Delta 3 rocket  is required, while  for the 6 
- 10  aperture  cases,  a Delta  4  is  required,  and  the  use  of  an  Ariane  5  is  required  for  the  12 
aperture  interferometer.    Both  the  bus  and  the  payload  costs  increase  linearly  with  the 
number of apertures, which is also the trend observed with the bus and payload masses.

SSI Image Distribution 
Similar  to  the  SCI  results,  the  expected  number  of  images  increases  with  the  number  of 
apertures.  Again, a sharp  increase  in the  total number of  images  is  again observed when  the 
number  of  apertures  is  increased  from  four  to  six,  and  this  can  be  attributed  to  the 
assumpt ions  made  in  the Markov  model.   Note  that  except  for  the  four  spacecraft  case,  the 
expected  number  of  images  is  higher  than  the  results  shown  in  the  SCI  design.  This  is 
mainly  attributed  to  allowing  the  separated  apertures  to  re-posit ion  to  a  different  set  of 
optimal  imaging  locat ions when one or more  apertures  fail.  For  example,  the  SSI  apertures 
in  an  optimal  six  aperture  configurat ion  can  be  reconfigured  to  assume  the  optimal  five 
aperture configurat ion when one aperture fails.   This option, however,  is not  available  to  the 
SCI and will therefore explain the  lower number of images obtained.

SSI Total Mass Distribution 
Similar  to  the SCI design,  the  total mass o f  the  interferometer  is dominated by  the dry mass 
of the  interferometer.  However, in this case the propellant mass makes up quite a significant 
portion of the total spacecraft mass.   In reality,  the amount of propellant required  for the SSI 
is  in  fact  lower,  since  one  can  take  advantage  of  square  maneuvering  profiles  where  the 
spacecraft  can  be  allowed  to  drift  while  no  propellant  is  expended.    The  propellant 
calculat ion in this trade study assumes the spacecraft traverses a circular trajectory.

SSI Cost Distribution 
Except  for  the  sudden  jump  in  the  launch  vehicle  cost,  the  lifecyc le  cost  for  this  design 
increases  approximately  linearly with  the number of  apertures.  The  service of a  T itan  IV  is 
required  for  the  12  aperture  case,  while  the  8  and  10  aperture  cases  require  an  Ariane  V 
launch vehicle and the 4 and 6 aperture interferometers require a Delta IV rocket.

Total Mass Distribution - SCI vs SSI 
Comparison  between  the  two  architectures over  the  range  of  apertures  shows  a  higher  total 
mass  in  the SSI  case.  This  is mainly  attributed  to  the  added  spacecraft buses,  structure,  and 
propellant  required  for  each  aperture.   In  general,  the SCI  requires  more  structural mass  but 
surprisingly,  its overall dry mass  is  less  than  that  required  by  the  SSI.  This  lower  dry mass 
in the SCI could be due to the rather  short  aperture separations required.  In this analys is, we 
have  considered  planet  detection  as  the  key  object ive  and  a  maximum  baseline  of  only  120 
m  is  required.    However,  if  one  were  to  take  into  considerat ion  the  second  science 
requirement  (astrophysical  imaging)  where  milli-arcsec  reso lut ion  imaging  is  required, 
aperture  separations  of  at  least  1  km  are  required.    This will  increase  the  structural mass  of 
the  SCI  architecture  significant ly.    Correspondingly,  the  amount  of  propellant  required  to 
maneuver  the  different  spacecraft  in  the  SSI  case  will  increase  too.  The  impact  of  varying 
the aperture separations has on the overall architectural mass should be  investigated.

Cost Distribution - SCI vs SSI 
Consistent with the trend observed  in the architectural mass comparison, the  lifecycle cost of 
the  SSI  is  higher  than  the  SCI.  This  is  true  especially  for  designs  with  a  high  number  of 
apertures.  This higher SSI cost can be attributed to several factors: 
• 	 more massive design (from mass comparison), 
• 	 larger  launch vehicles required, 
• 	 more complex operations scenario, and 
• 	 higher  development  cost  an  SCI  is  probably  a  more  techno logically mature  design  than 
an SSI design.

Cost per Image - SCI vs SSI 
Even  though  the  SSI  has  a  higher  lifecycle  cost,  comparisons  between  the  architectures 
should  be  perform  based  upon  the  design’ s  cost  per  function  metric.    Figure  75  shows  the 
cost  per  image  for  the  two  architectures.  Even  though  we  observe  rather  significant 
differences  in  the  architecture’ s  lifecycle  cost, the  difference  in  the  cost  per  image  metric  is 
not  as  high.  This  is  mainly  due  to  the  higher  number  of  images  that  can  be  expected  from 
the SSI design.  In both cases, the  “ optimal”  so lut ion is to use the 8 aperture configuration.

8.2.3  Interferometer Type Trade Study 
The  architectures of  interest  for  the  systems  level  analysis o f TPF  are:  the SCI  and SSI, one 
and  two-dimensional  cases.  All  architectures  evaluated  are  symmetric  designs.  These  four 
interferometer  choices  were  traded  for  the  (constant)  configurat ion  of  4  apertures,  each 
having a 2 meter diameter; orbit ing at 1 AU. 

Image Distribution vs. Interferometer Type 
The  number  of  images  appears  to  be  more  dependent  on  the  aperture  configurat ion  than  on 
architecture  type.    In  this  case,  the  one-dimensional  architectures  out  perform  the  two-
dimensional  ones.  This  is  a  counter-intuit ive  result  because  we  naturally  expect  the  two 
dimensional  configuration  to be  more  efficient.   But  the  two-dimensional  case  does  not  null 
as well the one-dimensional case. 

We  would  also  expect  the  SSI  case  to  be  more  efficient,  a  dist inct  architecture  advantage. 
This  trade,  however,  does  not  show  the  graceful  degradat ion  capability  of  the  SSI 
configuration.  The  four  aperture  SSI  (based  on  our  failure  analysis)  is  the  smallest  SSI 
configuration  allowed.    So  a  single  co llector  failure will  cause  a  system  failure.    If  a  3  or  2 
collector  array  was  feasible,  then  the  SSI  architectures  would  gain  an  advantage.  This 
advantage  would  also  become  clear  if  our  baseline  design  consisted  of  more  than  four 
spacecraft.

Total Mass Distribution vs. Interferometer Type 
The  total  mass  of  the  SSI  architecture  is  clearly  larger  than  the  total  mass  of  the  SCI 
architecture.  There  are  several  contributors  to  the  addit ional  SSI  mass.    Some  examples 
include the fact that: 
• 	 each collector spacecraft requires  its own bus, 
• 	 the  propulsion  system  must  operate  over  a  large  range  of  thrust  which  is  inherent ly 
inefficient, and 
• 	 the structural mass savings (init ially thought to be considerable)  is minimal.

Cost Distribution vs. Interferometer Type 
The  cost  distribut ion  appears  to  scale  with  mass  and  complexity,  so  the  SSI  architecture  is 
duly penalized.  The  largest  increases  in cost come with extra development cost  (presumably 
due  to  complexity)  and  with  extra  bus  cost  (due  to  the  increase  in  bus  mass).  The  net 
difference  in mass between  the SCI and SSI architectures  is small enough,  though, that there 
is  negligible  launch  vehicle  penalty.  As  mass  increases,  we  are  sure  to  a  see  a  launch 
vehicle effect on the  interferometer trade.

Cost per Function vs. Interferometer Type 
The  cost  per  funct ion  is  a  combined  metric  attempting  to  capture  both  the  performance  and 
the cost we pay for that performance.   In this case,  the one-dimensional SCI architecture has 
the  “ best ”  cost  per  funct ion.    This  is  quite  obvious  because  the  one-dimensional  SCI  case 
matches  the  performance  o f  the  one-dimensional  SSI  case  for  the  cost  of  the  two-
dimensional  SCI  case.    The  “b est ”   architecture  will  likely  change  as  the  design  vector 
changes.  It is difficult to project the changes of the cost per function, because  it  incorporates 
both  image  distribut ion  and  cost  (mass  and  complexity)  effects.    Please  review  the  former 
sect ions to estimate these changes.

8.2.4  Aperture Diameter Trade Study 
This  study  analyzes  the  effect  on  the  system  performance  and  cost  due  to  variat ions  in  the 
aperture diameter, keeping all other design variables fixed. 

First  of  all  we  notice,  as  expected,  that  the  payload  cost  increases  as  the  aperture  size 
increases. The payload cost can be split  into  a fixed  component  and  a  component  that  varies 
with  the mirror size. This variable component  is proportional  to  the  aperture diameter  raised 
to the 2.67. 

The operations/development  cost  is  largely  independent of  the  aperture  size,  and  it  is  indeed 
constant  in  the  above  plots.  Moreover,  we  notice  that  this  cost  component  is  considerably 
bigger  in the SSI case, due to the increased complexity o f the SSI system over the SCI. 

The  bus  costs  are  higher  in  the  SSI  case,  since  we  have  to  duplicate  components  for  each 
and  every  one  o f  the  independent  spacecraft;  and  increase  with  the  aperture  size,  since 
bigger mirrors require more capabilit ies from the bus (e.g. thermal system). The SSI and SCI 
bus costs can be seen to differ by a constant term. 

Finally,  the  launch costs are essent ially the  same  for  the  two  cases. However, we notice  that 
for D=4m in  the SSI case, we have a  jump  in  the  launch cost. This  is due  to  the  fact  that  the 
total system mass exceeds the capabilit ies of  the previously selected  launcher, and requires a 
more expensive  launch system. 

As  a  consequence  of  the  above  trends,  the  total  costs  in  both  the  SSI  and  SCI  cases  grow 
more  than  quadrat ically  with  the  aperture  size.  The  cost  difference,  on  the  other  hand, 
appears  to  be  constant,  and  is  due  mainly  to  the  cost  difference  in  the  operations  and 
development, and secondarily to different bus costs.

Figure 81. Cost vs. Aperture Size (SSI) 

The  increased  co llect ion  area  allows  for  a  bigger  harvest  of  photons  from  the  target;  as  a 
consequence,  the  integration  times  required  for  each  image  will  be  reduced  accordingly. 
Since we  are  considering  a  constant  time  delay  between  observat ions,  it  can  be  easily  seen 
that  as  the  aperture  diameter  grows,  the  total  number  of  images  per  unit  time  goes  to  some 
asymptotic value. This effect  is the same for both SSI and SCI cases. 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 163 of 175 

The cost per  image  shows  a generally decreasing behavior  in  the  range we have  considered, 
showing  optimum  values  at  the  right  end  of  the  plot.  The  SSI  case  presents  a  very  slight 
minimum at  3.5m,  due  to  the  increase  in  the  launch  cost  for  D=4m  discussed  in  the  above. 
Since  the  total  cost  increases  as  D2.67 ,  while  the  total  number  of  images  approaches  a 
constant value,  the  cost per  image will  eventually  increase  at  the  same  rate  as  the  total cost. 
This means  that  the cost per  image will have some minimum value,  that form  the  plot  above 
appears  to  be  close  to  4m.  On  the  other  hand,  the  cost  difference  approaches  a  constant 
value, as  it will eventually be the ratio of two constants. 

On  the  very  limited  trade  space  analyzed  here,  it  appears  that  an  SCI  architecture  with 
D=4m would be the optimum with respect to the aperture size. 

8.2.5  Summary of Trade Studies 
Orbit 
Generally,  the  total  number  of  images,  mass,  and  cost  increase  as  orbit  increases.    The 
number  of  images  reaches  the  maximum  of  approximately  1200  images  after  about  3  AU 
because  the  effect  of  the  local  zodiacal  dust  becomes  sma ll.  Therefore  orbit  does  not 
influence the number of images any more.   The same  number of images  is expected for both 
SSI  and  SCI  architectures  with  the  same  number  of  apertures  and  same  sized  aperture 
diameters.   SSI  in general will have higher mass and cost.  Since  the  total number  of  images 
is the same for both SSI and SCI, the ratio  of total cost over the number  images (the cost  per 
image)  is lower for SCI.  The lowest cost per image occurs when the orbit is 2.5 AU  for SCI. 
Unfortunately, 2.5 AU  is  located  in the asteroid belt,  so  future work  is  required  to  see  if  this 
orbit  is feasible for TPF. 

Number of Apertures 
Total number  of  images, mass,  and  cost  increase  as  the  number  of  apertures  increases.    SSI 
produces more  images  than  SCI  except when  number  of  apertures  is  four.  This  trade  study 
shows  that  the  total  mass,  cost,  and  cost  per  image  is  higher  for  SSI  designs  than  SCI 
designs.    The  lowest  cost  per  image  for  both  SCI  and  SSI  is  attained  when  the  number  of 
apertures is  eight. 

Size of Aperture 
As  the  aperture  diameter  increases,  the  total  number  of  images  and  total  cost  increases. 
Total  cost  increases  as  diameter  to  the  power  of  2.67,  and  the  total  number  of  images 
increases  until  it  meets  its  asymptotic  value.    The  total  number  of  images  for  both  SSI  and 
SCI  are  the  same  for  the  same  aperture  diameter.    The  lowest  cost  per  image  occurs  when 
the  aperture  diameter  is  3.5  m  for  the  SSI  and  4  m  for  the  SCI.    Since  the  total  number  of 
image  reaches  a  constant  after  4  m,  and  the  cost  increases  as  the  size  of  the  aperture 
diameters  increases;  the cost per image will start to increase after 4 m. 

Interferometer Type 
The  trade  study  of  Interferometer  type  vs.  metrics  shows  that  the  cost  and  mass  of  SSI 
designs  are  generally  higher  than  SCI  designs.    One-dimensional  designs  have  a  higher 

ASTRO-002 Rev. -­
May 17, 1999 
Page 164 of 175 

imaging  rate  than  two-dimensional  designs  for  both  SSI  and  SCI  architectures.  Combining 
these  two  trends  produces  a  result  that  an  SCI  one-dimensional  architecture  generates  the 
lowest cost per image. 

8.2.6  Combined Case Results 
The  different  one-dimensional  trades  show  the  existence  of  local minima  along  single  axes 
for  the  different  trades.  These  minima,  however,  do  not  tell  us  anything  about  the  global 
optimum so lut ion.   To  determine  the  global  optimum,  the  ent ire  trade  space must  be  search 
since one does not know  the  exact  shape of  the design  surface.   Due  to  time  constraints,  the 
team  decided  to  perform  simulat ions  for  two  more  case  studies  by  combining  the  different 
local  minimum  configurat ions  based  upon  the  trade  studies  performed  for  the  two 
interferometer  types  (SSI  and  SCI).   The  input  variables  and  the  results  from  the  two 
combined designs are tabulated in Table 33. 

Based  upon  the  cost  per  image  metric,  the  results  given  by  these  two  cases  are  in  fact  the 
lowest  in  their  respect ive  interferometer  types.    In  both  cases  the  total  mass  o f  the  array  is 
rather  large,  to  the  point  that  no  launch  vehicle  can  provide  the  velocity  increment  required 
to place the  interferometers  into their operating orbits.  In the case of the SSI, there exists the 
option of using mult iple launch vehicles - this option was not explored  in our study.   Similar 
to  the  higher  interferometer  masses  shown  in  Table  33,  the  life-cycle  costs  of  the 
interferometers  came  out  to  be  high  too.    However,  due  to  the  higher  expected  number  of 
images,  the  cost  per  image  of  the  interferometers  turned  out  to  be  the  lowest  of  all  the 
architectures that we have studied. 

It  is  important  to note  that  the  two  architectures  shown  in Table 33  are  not  the  architectures 
that  give  the  global  minimum  to  the  cost  per  image  metric. 
In  fact,  the  different 
architectures  that  have  been  studied  do  not  give  any  indicat ion  as  to  what  the  global 
minimum is.  However, the architectures that are presented in Table 33 are the ones  that give 
the best  cost  per  funct ion metric  among  the  different  architectures  that we  have  studied.    In 
order to determine the global optimum architecture, the entire trade space must be searched.

8.2.7  Operational Trade Results 
The  previous  trades  varied  one  of  the  four  parameters  in  the  design  vector  to  determine  the 
effect  of  that  parameter  on  the  total  system.    Eventually,  we  wish  to  fill  in  our  entire  trade 
space  by  varying  several  parameters  to  arrive  at  an  “ optimal”   so lution  for  a  chosen  system 
metric.    The  operations  trade-study  captures  the  dynamics  of  the  operational  component 
while  several  variables  are  changed.    Since  operations  cost  and  operationally-derived 
performance  losses  have  such  a  large  impact  on  total  mission  cost  and  performance,  it 
behooves  the  mission  designer  to  understand  the  coupling  of  operations  with  the  other 
design vectors. 

Crew Sizes vs. Time 
Different  staffing  levels will be required at  different  times during  the mission.   The graph  in 
Figure  82  shows  the  effect  of  time  on  the  crew  levels  o f  four  different  configurat ions.  The 
increase  in  complexity  between  the  SCI  and  more  complex  SSI  types  increases  the  crew 
levels,  despite  learning  curve  effects  of  operating  more  similar  spacecraft.  Increasing  the 
distance  at which TPF operates  (ex.  from 1  to 5 AU) would  tend  to  increase  the  transit  time 
and cost.

Operations Cost Breakdown 
In  the  graph  in  Figure  83  we  witness  the  effect  of  increasing  mission  complexity  on  two 
different  components  of  operational  cost.   Notice  the  large  jump  in  yearly  maintenance 
between  the  SCI  and  the  least  complex  SSI.  This  represents  the  difficulty  from  switching 
from  a  single  satellite  operations  scenario  to  a  constellat ion  and  the  attendant  increase  in 
control center  size  and  capability.  Also  notice  that  further  increases  in  complexity  to  8  and 
12  aperture  SSI  configurat ions  have  only  a  marginal  effect  on  yearly  maintenance.  Labor

costs increase relatively  linearly between  the architectures shown.   Steady-state maintenance 
and  labor costs are relat ively  independent of final orbit.

complex SSI farthest away has  the most.  Notice also  that  the  rate of  inefficiency  increase  is 
greatest for the SSI with 8 collector spacecraft.

9.0  Conclusions 

9.1  TPF Architecture 
Table  34  provides  a  summary  of  the  best  cost  per  image  architectures  from  the  50  sample 
cases  that  were  examined  to  explore  the  one-dimensional  trades  for  both  SSI  and  SCI 
scenarios.  The  composite  architectures  represent  the  architectures  created  from  the 
individual minimum values  from  each one-dimensional  trade.   It must be  stressed  that  these 
do not  represent  “ optimal”  designs  –  t he  full  trade  space has  not yet been  explored  and  cost 
per  image  (CPI)  is  not  the  only  measure  of  the  quality  of  a  mission.  A  comparison  of  the 
SSI  and  SCI  architectures  reveals  that  the  missions  are  rather  different.   The  structurally 
connected  architectures 
(SCI)  consistently  outperformed 
the  separated  spacecraft 
architectures  (SSI)  when  applying  the  “ cost  per  image ”  metric.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that 
the  SCI  provided  good  passive  stability  and  led  to  advantageous  total  masses  when  only 
considering  interferometer baselines required for planet detection (up to ~ 120 m). It must  be 
ment ioned,  however,  that  the  advantages  of  a  separated  spacecraft  architecture  (SSI)  were 
not  fully  captured  in  the  present  study.  Namely,  the  ability  to  re-posit ion  the  apertures  in 
order  to  optimize  the  transmissivity  funct ion  or  to  compensate  for  aperture  failures  in  the 
SSI case has not been fully modeled.   Furthermore  it  is expected  that the mass advantages of 
the  SCI  will  be  lost  for  very  long  baselines,  where  we  expect  a  crossover  between  the  SSI 
and  the  SCI  case  as  explored  by  Surka  and  Stephenson.    It  is  expected  that  this  crossover 
will  be  visible  if  astrophysical  imaging  (baselines  up  to  ~  1000 m) were  to  be  incorporated 
into the current methodology.

9.2  TMAS 
The  team  was  able  to  successfully  design  and  implement  a  software  package  to  perform 
parametric  evaluations  of  different  TPF  mission  architectures.  Adopting  a  modular 
programming  protocol  and  using  Mat lab  functions  allowed  mult iple  sect ions  of  the  code 
(sub-modules)  to  be  coded  and  tested  in  parallel  instead  of  sequent ially,  thus  drastically 
reducing  the  software  development  time.    Interface  control  between  both  macro-modules 
and  sub-modules  appears  to  be  the  most  difficult  issue  when  developing  such  modular 
software, and was achieved through the use of N 2 diagramming techniques.

9.3  Lessons Learned 
The  first  lesson  learned  is  the  need  to  compromise  between  model  fidelity  and  simulat ion 
time.  Balancing  the complexity of  the analys is model and  the  limited  time available  became 
an  important  issue  throughout  the  entire  program.    This  became  most  evident  during  the 
trade-study phase.  The size of the test matrix was intent ionally reduced  in order to  finish the 
one  dimensional  trade  studies  during  the  time  remaining,  even  though  the  team would  have 
preferred to explore the ent ire system architecture trade space. 

Second,  the  team  learned  a  great  deal  about  the  systems  engineering  process.  Starting with 
the  init ial  definit ion  of  the  system  design  space,  through  init ial  evaluat ions  of  all  feasible 
system  architectures  and  down-selection  to  the  best  potential  options,  to  the  evaluat ion  of 
the  trade  studies,  this  course  provided  valuable  insight  about  the  systems  engineering 
process. 

The N2 diagram  technique proved  its worth by serving  as  an  Interface Control Document  to 
coordinate  the  integrated  development  of  the  software  modules  of  the  TMAS.    The  trade-
study process allowed  the team  to observe  the general  trends and relat ionships between each 
design  parameter  and  the  corresponding  outputs.  Using  these  key  relationships,  more 
detailed trade studies can be performed  in the future. 

Throughout  the  course,  team  members  gained  the  exper ience  of  participat ing  in  an 
integrated design  team,  including design and programming  tasks, sharing responsibilit ies  for 
making presentations, and creat ing engineering documentation. 

9.4  Recommendations and Future Work 
Our  recommendat ion  for  the  future  is  to  refine  and  improve  the  fidelity  o f  the  software 
models,  to  conduct  sensit ivity  analyses,  and  to  examine  the  entire  trade  space  using 
appropriate criteria to find the globally best architecture(s). 

First,  several  items  were  not  incorporated  into  the  TMAS  model  due  to  time  and  resource 
limitations  and  are  therefore  recommended  for  future  work.    Although  the  software  is 
already complex,  increasing the fidelity o f the modules will give more accurate solut ions. 

For the orbit transfer, the orbit module was based on the Hohmann’ s and Hill’ s transfer only. 
For future work, adding gravity assist or the  low  thrust  electric propulsion  trajectories  to  the 
orbit module will cut down the  V requirement and therefore cut down the  launch cost. 

For the launch vehicle module, only a single  launch vehicle was considered  for both SSI and 
SCI.  For an SSI, mult iple smaller  launch vehicles can be used.  For future work, the module 
can incorporate an option of using mult iple  launch vehicles if it cuts down the cost. 

For  the  SSI  case,  only  circular  trajectories  were  considered  for  image  maneuvering  to 
simplify  the  calculat ions.    If  other  trajectories  are  used,  such  as  drift  mode,  propulsion  can 
be saved and the cost will be decreased as a result.

For  designing  and  integrating  the  bus  module,  more  efficient  optimizat ion  algorithms  will 
help to reduce the complexity of the bus module and provide a better optimized bus design. 

For  the  dynamics,  optics,  controls  and  structures  (DOCS)  module,  a  number  of 
improvements  are  suggested  for  future  work.    First,  the  fidelity  of  the  spacecraft  structure 
and  compliant  trusses  in  the  SCI  case  must  be  improved  to  provide  better  accuracy  in  the 
higher  frequency  range.  Line-of-sight  (LOS)  jitter,  wavefront  tilt  (WFT)  and  different ial 
beam  shear  (DBS)  are other ways  in which  the dynamics  can  adversely  affect  the  signal-to­
no ise  ratio  (SNR)  of  the  observatory.    Furthermore,  the  incorporation  of  more  disturbance 
sources,  such  as  cryocoolers,  should  be  considered.    Finally  a  parametric  model  o f  the 
optical  train,  including  optical  delay  lines,  fast  steering  mirrors,  and  beam  compressors 
would  provide  a  more  realist ic  est imate  of  the  effects  and  limitat ions  of  optical  control  on 
the TPF performance. 

For  operations,  optimizing  the  automat ion  level  rema ins  as  possible  future  work. 
Addit ionally,  adding  astrophysical  imaging  capability  to  the model  is  also  recommended  as 
a future work. 

For  the  GINA  module,  many  o f  the  failure  rates  were  assumed  because  we  did  not  have 
enough  informat ion.   Adding  more reliability data  to  the model will result  in more  confident 
analys is and trade studies of architectures. 

Many o f  the  modules were  generated  assuming  current  resources  and  techno logy.    If  future 
techno logies  are  considered,  it  could  reduce  the  cost  as  well  as  the  development  time  for 
TPF. 

Addit ional  module  improvement  suggest ions  have  been  made  in  the  module  descript ion 
sect ions above. 

Second,  the  effects  on  the  cost  and  capability  metrics  were  examined  only  for  four  of  the 
most  fundamental  parameters.  The  TMAS  provides  the  capability  to  conduct  sensit ivity 
analyses  for  many  more  parameters  to  determine  the  robustness  of  the  mission  architecture 
to changing  init ial condit ions, mission profile,  model assumpt ions, costs, etc. 

Third,  full trade space  explorat ion  is  required  to  find  the best  architecture(s).  The  team was 
only  able  to  carry  out  the  single  point  trade  studies,  in  which  one  element  of  the  design 
vector was varied  at  a time  to  see  its  relat ionship with  the outputs.  This kind of  trade-study 
suggests the key relat ionships and general trends, but does not give the best solut ions.

Space Systems Engineering - 16.89 

Mission Description 

For almost two millennia, the scientiﬁc  community has 
developed  a  list  of  fundamental  questions  regarding 
life  and  the  formation  of  galaxies.  Is  life  unique  to 
Ear th?  How  did  life  originate  on  ear th?  Are  there 
habitable  planets  outside  our  solar  system?  The  list 
goes on and on. 

The  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration 
(NASA) has  formed  the Origins program, whose goal 
is  to  search  for  clues  which  may  help  answer  such 
fundamental  questions.  The  Terrestrial  Planet  Finder 
mission  (TPF)  is a key component  in NASA’ s Origins 
program. The TPF mission  is  to conduct a search  for 
Ear th-like  planets  around  nearby  stars.  This  space-
borne observatory will directly detect and characterize 
these  planets  and  other  astropysical  phenomena  by 
nulling the light of the parent star. The TPF mission will 
champion  nulling  interferometry  technology  to  attain 
an  unparalleled  level  of  sensitivity,  resolution,  and 
starlight suppression. 

Speciﬁcally ,  TPF  is  searching  for  answers  to  the 
following questions: 

• Do any nearby planets satisfy our requirements for 
life? 
• What are the  frequency, atmospheric composition, 
and physical properties of planets outside our solar 
system? 
• How do these planets differ from Earth? 

TPF  will  also  provide  an  exceptional  oppor tunity  to 
broaden  our  understanding  of  a  wide  range  of 
astrophysical  phenomena  including  star  and  planet 
formations,  comets,  distant  starbursts  and  active 
galaxies. 

ASTRO Project Scope 

The  ASTRO  project  goal  is  to  identify  and  design  the 
most  appropriate  mission  architecture  for  TPF.  To  that 
end,  the  team will  conduct  a  trade  study  of  the mission 
architectures  using  a  quantitative  systems  engineering 
methodology.  Each  architecture  candidate,  including 
structurally connected and separated spacecraft options, 
will be subject to the following requirements. 

Requirements Document Scope 

This  document  sets  for th  the  scientiﬁc  objectives,  the 
system  requirements,  and  the  design  requirements 
which  must  be  accommodated  by  the  spacecraft  bus, 
payload,  and  operations  design.  Each  requirements’ 
source,  intent, and expected veriﬁcation  technique have 
also  been  tabulated.  This  original  issue  contains  a 
consistent  set  of  requirements  that  will  be  used  as  a 
guide during the preliminary and critical design phases.

Motivation for an Electronic Format 

Simplified Configuration Control 

Organizing requirements with  computer programs, in 
a data base or even linked spreadsheets, is becoming 
the norm. 

An electronic format offers several advantages that the 
standard document does not.  Users can easily  trace 
how a change in one requirement can affect the entire 
document; and  they can access requirements at their 
preferred level of complexity. 

The  following  electronic  document  uses  hyper text 
links  to  organize  the  data.  Hyper text  is  a  very  user 
friendly  and  accepted  method  that  applies  well  to 
requirements.  Some  of  the  speciﬁc  advantages 
follow: 

Enables a Top Level Organization 

Standard 
listed 
documents  are 
requirement 
sequentially,  proceeding  to  the  lowest  level  before 
reaching the next top level. This organization provides 
an easy way  to  trace changes  in  requirements, but  is 
somewhat cumbersome.  The end user  is not always 
interested in the lowest level of complexity. 

The electronic  format helps  to simplify  the conﬁgur ation 
control. 

If  a  user wants  to  change  a  requirement  he  can  isolate 
the  children  of  that  requirement. 
In  fact,  the  top  level 
organization  ensures  that  each  requirement  has  a 
deﬁned  parent  - child  relationship.  This  means  that  a 
change  in  a  requirement  will  trace  down  to  the  lower 
levels  and  no 
rogue 
requirements  will 
remain 
unchanged. 

Source, Intent, and Veri ﬁcation 

The  context  of  any  requirement  is  essential  to  its 
effectiveness.  When requirements are browsed by those 
who  are  unfamiliar  with 
the  document, 
they  can 
determine  the  intent  and  source  of  that  requirement. 
This  deﬁnitely  helps  in  requirement  reﬁnement  and  re­
writes. 

For  cer tain  missions  it  is  also  essential  to  establish 
veriﬁcation  requirements.  These  state  how  to  verify  the 
given  requirement,  sometimes  suggesting  a  speciﬁc 
approach. 

A document with hyper text links allows the end user to 
navigate  to  the  level  of  complexity  of  interest.  If  the 
user wants to go to a lower level, he/she can just click 
on that par ticular requirement. 

The electronic  format provides an easy way  to store the 
intent and veriﬁcation  information.  Databases are often 
used, but for this mission a table is just as effective.  The 
“Intent and V eriﬁcation” link is a vailable below.

Appendix B.  Results of the Aperture Configuration Module
The  results  for  the  different  aperture  configurat ions  are  tabulated  below.  Note  that  thes
e
results do not include configurat ions optimized with the aperture size set as a free parameter
.
In  performing  the  optimizat ion,  it  was  observed  that  these  second  set  of  optimizat ion
s
(aperture  size  as  free  parameter)  seems  to  arrive  at  solutions  with  the  same  aperture  size
.
This may be attributed to the phasing angles that were chosen  for the apertures, which seem
s
to make single aperture size configurat ions more preferential.
