Executive Summary


1. Introduction 

1.1  Design challenge 

The MIT  16.89  / ESD  352  space  systems  engineering  course  covers  the  fundamentals  of 
systems  engineering and  architecting  through  lectures,  and  applies  these  fundamentals  in 
a  space  system  design  study.  This  year’s  design  effort  focused  on  crewed  surface 
mobility  systems  for  the  Moon,  Mars,  and  analog  sites  on  Earth,  supporting  the  Vision 
for Space Exploration (VSE). 

The  VSE  calls  for  human  exploration  of  the  Moon,  preparing  the  way  for  human  Mars 
missions. Figure 1 overviews NASA’s development and exploration roadmap as of 2005. 
In  this  plan,  lunar  exploration  begins  with  robotic  orbital  and  surface  missions  while 
crewed vehicles are developed. Crewed missions to the Moon would begin with so-called 
sortie  missions  operationally  similar  to  the  Apollo  J-type  missions,  with  multiple  EVAs 
and  geologic  excursions  from  the  lander.  Subsequent  missions  would  build  up  a 
permanently  occupied  outpost  similar  to  Antarctic  research  stations.  Later  missions 
would  begin  Mars  development,  beginning  around  2030,  using  conjunction-class 
trajectories to provide surface stays of 500-600 days. 

Figure 1: Strategic roadmap for the Vision for Space Exploration, NASA, 2005 

Surface  mobility  systems  will  play  a  critical  role  in  effective  lunar  and  Mars  surface 
exploration, because they extend the reach of  the crew beyond walking distance (< 5 km) 
from  the  outpost  or  lander,  greatly  increase  the  speed  of  surface  mobility,  and  provide 
capability  to  move  equipment,  experiments  and  supplies.  For  long-duration  stays  on  the 
Moon  and Mars,  pressurized mobility systems  can  extend  surface  excursions  beyond  the 
duration  of  regular  EVAs,  thereby  extending  the  range  of  crew  exploration  from  20-30 
km to more than 100 km, and greatly enhancing the return value of such a mission. 

Our design  study builds  upon  a  large number  of  previous  analyses  for  lunar  and Martian 
surface  mobility  systems,  emphasizing  potential  gains  achievable  through  platform 
commonality. While previous studies have generally focused on point designs for specific 
operating  environments,  our  study  considers  a  fleet  of  pressurized  and  unpressurized 
vehicles  for  the Moon,  Mars,  and  Earth  analog  sites,  using  common  elements  to  reduce 
costs and facilitate testing. The class received the following challenge: 

“This  year’s  16.89/ESD.352  Space  Systems  Engineering  class  will  engage  in 
the  question  of  how  to  best  architect  and  design  a  future,  extensible  planetary 
surface  transportation  system.  The  system  will  be  designed  for  the  Moon  with 
considerations  for  eventual  adaptation  to  Mars.  In  addition,  the  class  will 
consider  how  a  terrestrial  version  of  the  lunar  transportation  system  can  be 
built for testing in lunar and Mars analog sites on the Earth.” 

1.2 Analysis and Design Approach 
The class began with a systematic analysis of Moon and Mars mobility requirements and 
architectures,  then  developed  subsystem-level  design  for  a  single  preferred  architecture. 
The  design model  provides  end-to-end mapping  from  environment  parameters  to  system 
parameters  to  operational  capabilities.  Design  effort  concentrated  most  heavily  on  lunar 
vehicles, providing a detailed baseline from which differences  in Earth and Mars systems 
can be inferred. 

The remaining chapters of  the report follow  the approach  the class  took  to addressing the 
extensible surface mobility design challenge: 

•	 Chapter  2,  Mobility  System  Requirements  Analysis,  examines  value-delivering 
activities  on  the  lunar  surface  to  understand  how  value  can  be  delivered  by  a 
planetary  surface  mobility  system  for  human  exploration.  We  present  a  formal 
problem  statement  capturing  beneficiaries,  operands,  intent,  operating  processes  and 
system  form. Specific value-delivering processes  are  grouped  into  4  design  reference 
missions  (DRM)  based  on  their  relationships  to  one  another.  The  problem  statement 
and DRMs provide the basis for Level 1 and Level 2 requirements. 

•	 Chapter  3, Mobility  System Architecture  Analysis,  documents  analysis  of  surface 
mobility  architectures  following  the  requirements  in  Chapter  2.  We  quantitatively 
analyze  a  large  number  of  mobility  architectures,  accounting  for  failure  modes  and 
associated  walk-back  /  drive-back  constraints  for  crew  safety.  Architectures  are 
evaluated  according  to  cumulative  performance  and  mass.  Using  a  reference  design, 
we  conduct  a  sensitivity  analysis  for  parameters  held  constant  in  the  architecture 
analysis, providing the basis for an informed architecture selection. 

•	 Chapter 4, Mobility System Design, overviews the detailed vehicle design effort for 
a  lunar  mobility  system  carried  out  based  on  the  final  architecture  selection.  This 
effort  used  a  linked  array  of  parametric  models  to  size  subsystems  for  a  baseline 
design,  which  was  subsequently  detailed  with  geometric  layout,  and  analyzed  for 

operational  performance.  This  chapter  constitutes  Part  1  of  our  answer  to  the  design 
challenge. 

•	 Chapter  5,  Integrated  Dynamic  Capability  Analysis,  overviews  the  integrated 
capability  analysis  framework MUSE  used  to  analyze  operational  performance,  with 
sample results for a few specific locations on the Moon. 

•	 Chapter  6,  Commonality  with  Earth  and  Mars  Mobility  Systems,  describes  the 
commonality  analysis  carried  out  during  and  after  the  detailed  lunar  vehicle  design. 
This  analysis  investigated  the  sensitivity  of  subsystems  to  changes  in  the  planetary 
environment, and identified identical, related, and custom elements required to extend 
the  lunar  design  to  a  platform  providing  Earth,  Moon,  and  Mars  capabilities.  The 
commonality analysis constitutes Part 2 of our answer to the design challenge. 

•	 Chapter  7,  Summary  and  Conclusions,  summarizes  the  design  effort  and  results 
documented in this report. 

•	 Chapter  8,  Acknowledgements,  recognizes  those  people  who  contributed  to  the 
class through lectures, design reviews, design participation, and general advice. 

•	 Chapter 9, References, lists sources cited throughout the report. 

•	 Chapter 10, Appendices, provides a wealth of backup  information related  to various 
sections in the report. 

2. Mobility System Requirements Analysis 
Designing  a  planetary  mobility  system  platform  extending  across  multiple  decades  and 
multiple  environments  requires  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  stakeholders  of  the 
system, and how it delivers value to these stakeholders. Our analysis of the value delivery 
mechanism  provides  the  basis  for  top-level  requirements  that  flow  down  to  Level  1  and 
Level 2 requirements through analysis of system context and use cases. 

2.1 Problem Statement 
Early on, the class brainstormed processes and activities that deliver value on a planetary 
surface. Based on this survey, the activities that require a surface mobility system 
(pressurized and unpressurized) were distilled and documented. The OPM diagram in 
Figure 2 shows the result of this analysis: 

Figure 2: OPM view of the high-level surface mobility system architecture focused on value-delivery 

The  primary  beneficiaries  of  Moon  and  Mars  surface  exploration  are  scientists  (acquire 
data),  explorers  (access  new  locations),  operators  (gain  experience),  and  the  American 
public  (enjoy  “armchair  exploration”  and  sharpen  interest  in  science  and  engineering). 
The  specific  benefits  of  these  groups  can  be  categorized  broadly  into  information, 
material, and location: 
•	
Images, video, and data transmitted back to Earth 
•	 Permanent goods delivered to the lunar surface, and samples delivered back from 
the lunar surface 
•	 Access to locations and sites that yield valuable data or samples, or have never 
been explored before 

The  planetary  surface  mobility  system  satisfies  these  needs  by  providing  capability  to 
conduct  short-range  and  long-range  excursions,  to  transport  supplies  from  a  lander  to  an 
outpost, and to construct outposts and supporting infrastructure. The primary measures of 
effectiveness  for  the  mobility  system  were  cost  and  performance;  mass  was  used  as  a 
proxy for cost. 

The  class  made  an  early  decision  to  exclude  outpost  interfaces  and  elements  from  our 
design  scope  in order  to  enable more detailed  analysis and  design of  the mobility system 
itself. Therefore, the mobility system was considered decoupled from the outpost, and we 
made  no  attempt  to  optimize  combined  characteristics  of  outpost  and  mobility  systems, 
nor to consider architectures not involving an outpost or lander. 

Several important attributes of the mobility system followed immediately from the design 
challenge and value analysis: 
•	 The mobility system must be extensible from the Moon to Mars, and a modified 
version must be testable on Earth 
•	 The mobility system must provide short-range exploration capability for lunar 
sortie missions 
•	 The mobility system must be reusable over several surface missions; investment 
in a new mobility system for each surface mission is not practical 
•	 The mobility system must satisfy the interface requirements of other outpost 
elements; a context analysis identified these requirements in detail (see below). 

Based  on  Figure  2,  the  class  generated  a  formal  problem  statement  that  served  as  a 
guideline for further requirements and architecture analysis and design: 

•	

The goal of the surface mobility system is 
•	 To extend the capabilities of Moon and Mars surface exploration 
•	 By providing the capabilities to carry out 4 types of design reference missions 
on the Moon, Mars, and in analog environments on Earth 
�	 Short-distance excursions (unpressurized) 
�	 Long-distance excursions (separate pressurized capability) 
�	 Base-re-supply excursions (cargo transport) 
�	
Infrastructure build-up missions (cargo delivery, moving of resources, etc.) 
In a sustainable way (metrics) 
�	 Affordably 
�	 Providing continued value delivery 
�	 With acceptable development and operational risk (especially to human life) 
�	 Policy robust 
•	 Using a surface transportation system which 
�	
Is extensible from Moon to Mars, and can be tested on Earth 
�	 Can provide short-distance capability for lunar sortie missions early 
�	
Is reusable for multiple surface missions 
�	 Can successfully interface with other exploration system elements (such as 
habitats, communications equipment, electrical power system, etc.) 

2.2 Design Reference Missions 
The class outlined four Design Reference Missions (DRMs) used to evaluate our 
architectural choices. The DRMs were designed to cover the broad range of operational 
tasks that astronauts would perform on the Earth, Moon, and Mars. Table 1 summarizes 
the where each of the DRMs are performed.

Sortie missions refer to short surface stays (up to one week) on the surface of the Moon, 
during which astronauts live in the lunar lander. Sortie missions cannot be performed on 
Mars, since Mars expeditions will be much longer due to trajectory constraints. 

Outpost missions will occur on both the Moon and Mars, in which astronauts will live in 
a habitation module that is part of a pre-placed outpost encampment. A typical Moon 
mission may last up to 180 days, while typical Mars missions will last ~600 days 
[CE&R]. 

DRM-1: Short Distance Excursion 
Short distance excursions will explore the immediate vicinity around the LSAM or 
outpost, similar to the Apollo 15-17 excursions using the LRV. Astronauts performing a 
DRM-1 would wear space suits, and not make use of pressurized mobility elements. 
Primary DRM-1 tasks include: 
1.	 Geological survey 
General science investigation of local sites of interest and surveying of the 
immediate vicinity, including scouting, photo/video documentation, and some 
sample collection. 
2.	 Deployment of science instruments 
Similar to the ALSEP packages on the Apollo missions, astronauts can deploy 
surface science instruments near the base. 
3.	 Investigation of primary science sites 
The LSAM / outpost will likely be situated near several scientific sites of interest, 
allowing astronauts to use the mobility system to travel to a science site to 
conduct detailed surveys and sample collection, including sub-surface drilling. 

Duration and Range 
The duration of a DRM-1 excursion is limited by space suit life support capacity and 
astronaut fatigue, nominally assumed 8 hours based on current space suit technology. To 
determine the range of a DRM-1, we investigated Apollo 15-17 traverses and found that 
astronauts reached a maximum distance (radius) from the LEM of ~11 km [Surface 
Journal]. This constraint was observed so that if the LRV failed, the astronauts would be 
able to walk back to the LEM. Since the proposed lunar missions are longer and carry 
more crew, we expect that the desired exploration area would be increased, and so also 
the maximum distance from the outpost. 

Safety 
At a distance of 20 km from the base, astronauts are unlikely to have sufficient suit life 
support capacity to walk back to base if their mobility system fails. We consider two 
contingency solutions: First, they could use multiple vehicles during a DRM-1 excursion, 
and in an emergency the astronauts on the failed vehicle could “piggy-back” on the 
remaining vehicle(s) to return to base. Second, supply caches could be left at various 
points during the excursion to be used if astronauts were forced to walk back to base. 

DRM-2: Long Distance Excursion 
Unlike short-distance excursions, long-distance excursions use a pressurized mobility 
element to visit sites beyond the range of a single EVA. Astronauts performing a DRM-2 
would be equipped with space suits but would doff their suits and live inside the 
pressurized element between EVA periods. 

DRM-2 tasks include those in DRM-1, along with tasks such as eating, sleeping, and 
washing inside the pressurized element. DRM-2 is only possible during outpost missions, 
since pressurized mobility elements would not be included onboard an LSAM designated 
for sortie missions. 

Duration and Range 
Duration depends primarily on the life support capacity of the pressurized mobility 
system, making this a design variable. A typical DRM-2 would consist of 2 days to drive 
to the site of interest, 3 days of exploration in the vicinity of the site, and 2 days to drive 
back to the outpost, for a total of 7 days. This quantity remains a variable for the 
architectural selection and detailed design phases. 

The desired range of DRM-2 excursions follows from the distribution of science sites on 
both the Moon and Mars. The ESAS report notes that the major lunar sites of scientific 
interest are distributed roughly 100 km apart, with minor sites in between [CE&R]. This 
was used as the upper bound for DRM-2 range: we assume that the outpost would be 
landed near a major science site, and the astronauts would travel no farther than the next 
closest major site. For Mars, the Draper/MIT CE&R report distinguishes between major 
science sites, with an average spacing of 200 km, and “National Parks”, which are 
clusters of science sites with an average spacing of 4500 km, as shown in Figure 3 
[CE&R]. It is unlikely that any practical mobility system will be able to traverse this 

latter distance, so we assume that the outpost is landed near a National Park, and that the 
astronauts use the mobility system to get to the nearest major site. 

Figure 3: Mars science site distribution 

Safety 
Astronauts on DRM-2 would not be able to walk back in an emergency, necessitating a 
multi-vehicle architecture. If an unpressurized element fails, then the astronauts can use 
other unpressurized elements to either continue the mission or abort and return to the 
base. If a pressurized element fails, either a duplicate pressurized element must be 
available that can support all astronauts, or the unpressurized elements must be fast 
enough to allow the astronauts to drive up to 200 km back to base without re-supply. 

DRM-3: Re-supply Logistics 
Moon outpost missions may require unpiloted cargo flights from Earth in order to 
replenish supplies. DRM-3 tasks involve driving to the re-supply lander, loading pallets 
onto the vehicle, and driving back. The total cargo mass supplied depends on the mission. 
For example, for a 6-month outpost mission for 4 astronauts, we estimate that a total of 
7.3 mt of cargo is required to support the crew, based on logistics models developed by 
researchers at MIT. 

Duration and Range 
We do not impose a limit on the total amount of time required for re-supply, but we 
stipulate that number of consecutive EVA hours on DRM-3 does not exceed the capacity 
of the space suit (8 hours), even if multiple EVAs are required. We assume that the re­
supply craft lands in the vicinity of the base. Apollo experience and current technology 
allows a precision landing within several hundred meters of the target, but the re-supply 
craft may be required to land up to 2 km away from the outpost to prevent blast effects 
from damaging outpost structures. This provides a guideline for the range of DRM-3 
excursions. 

Safety

Since the re-supply craft will land within within a few kilometers of the outpost,

astronaut(s) would walk back to base in the event of a vehicle failure.


DRM-4: Infrastructure Operations 
A lunar or Mars outpost would require upkeep, maintenance, and infrastructure setup 
tasks in addition to exploration. Figure 4 shows the ESAS baseline design of a lunar 
outpost, which involves several large, pre-deployed modules [ESAS]: 

Figure 4: ESAS Outpost Baseline Design 

These modules would not be moved or modified, but several tasks would be required to 
maintain the base and obtain science return in the vicinity of the outpost. These tasks are: 
1.	 Deployment of science instruments 
Science packages will be deployed around the base to run experiments and take 
measurements of the local environment. Experience from Apollo (such as 
the ALSEP) shows that these packages can be on the order of 10 to 100 kg 
[Apollo Experiments Catalog]. 
2.	 Transmission cable deployment 
The outpost will be pre-deployed on multiple robotic landers prior to the arrival of 
the crew. Although these modules will not require setup, they will require 
establishing connections between them. 
3.	 Light surface construction 
Astronauts could move regolith on a small scale to construct berms for rocket 
plume / radiation shielding, clear terrain for roadways, or dig trenches for sub ­
surface investigation. ESAS considers construction activities to be an “evolved” 
activity, not immediately needed. 

Duration and Range 
As for DRM-3, we assume that infrastructure operations would be performed using single 
EVAs  without  overnight  stays  away  from  the  outpost.  Thus  a  single  DRM-4  EVA  does 
not exceed 8 hours. Also, since all DRM-4 operations are performed in the vicinity of the 
outpost, astronauts would not range beyond ~5 km from the base. 

Safety 
Astronauts  can  walk  back  to  the  habitation  module  if  mobility  system  units  fail. 
Assuming  astronauts  maintain  appropriate  time  and  EVA  consumable margins  while  on 

DRM-4,  they  would  always  have  sufficient  life  support  resources  in  their  space  suits  to 
return to the habitat.

2.3 Requirements Flow-Down 
Based  on  the  problem  statement  and  the  definition  of  design  reference  missions, 
requirements  analysis was  carried  out  for  defining  lower-level  requirements  essential  for 
system  design.  Requirements  analysis  was  based  on  context  analysis  (see  Figure  5)  and 
on  review  of  literature  on  subsystem  requirements  and  constraints.  Figure  6  shows  an 
excerpt  from  the  final  level  0  to  level  2  requirements  table  used  by  the  class.  The 
requirements were organized into three groups: 
•	 General  requirements  capturing  crew  safety  and  programmatic  issues  such  as 
reusability, lunar sortie mission requirements, etc. 
•	 DRM-specific requirements detailing the DRMs 
•	
Interface requirements to other elements of the overall exploration architecture 

The  full  requirements  table  in  spreadsheet  form  is  provided  on  a  CD  together  with  the 
class documents and models.

3. Mobility System Architecture Analysis 

3.1 System Ground Rules and Assumptions 

A number of assumptions were made in order to define the architecture analysis. These 
relate to the mission framework, safety requirements, and other basic concerns. 

•	 Though the system would be used for both exploration and testing on the Earth, 
Moon and Mars, the architecture analysis was performed based on the Moon and 
Mars only in order to ensure efficiency in these mass-constrained environments. The 
same architecture was then used for the Earth-based vehicle, to preserve 
commonality. 

•	

Initial study suggested that the design and architecture would be driven by DRM-1 
and DRM-2 requirements, so DRM-3 and DRM-4 were not included in the 
architecture analysis. 

•	 The mass and geometry of the system were constrained to be within transportation 
capabilities for Earth, Moon, and Mars. This included transport limitations faced in 
delivering the system to remote locations on Earth. 

•	 For safety, it was assumed that the crew would always operate in groups of at least 
two. This means that for any leg of a traverse, or for any pressurized volume, there 
would be at least two crew. 

•	 Pressurized mobility assets were required to provide the shielding and life-support 
necessary to survive a Solar Particle Event (SPE) of reasonable intensity. It was 
assumed that three hours warning could be provided for such an SPE. 

•	

It was assumed that actual distances traversed on an excursion would average 50% 
higher than the two-way straight-line distance to the farthest point of the excursion, 
based on experience from Apollo LRV traverses. 

3.2 Metric Analysis 
In selecting metrics, we considered cost, vehicle capability, science value, risk, 
extensibility, and robustness. Mass serves as a proxy for cost, since it drives launch costs 
and correlates with development costs. Vehicle capability includes attributes such as 
range, speed, cargo capacity, crew capacity, or terrain performance. Science value can be 
quantified in several ways, as discussed below. In our analysis, risk, extensibility, and 
robustness ultimately served as constraints rather than metrics. 

The pre-existing surface mobility vehicle model used for the architectural study used the 
capability parameters mentioned above as inputs to the model and provided mass as an 
output. Hence mass was used as the cost metric. 

In defining a metric for science value, we considered modeling site visitation of actual or 
assumed geographical distributions of sites of interest, but this approach was deemed too 
complicated for the architecture analysis. Instead, we assumed a constant time required 
for science exploration at a single site, and measured the number of sites visited assuming 
a uniform linear distribution of sites along the traverse path. While simple, this metric 
ensured an appropriate balance of time spent at each individual site and distance covered 
to visit several sites. Any time on an excursion not spent driving, loading, or unloading 
was assumed to be available for science activities. The driving time was calculated by 
dividing the traverse length by the assumed vehicle speed, and the loading time was 
calculated according to an assumed constant divided by the number of crew. 

tscience  = ttotal  – ttraverse  – tloading 
ttraverse  = range/speed 
tloading  = loading time (crew-hours) / ncrew 
# sites = max(tscience  × ncrew  / time per site, number of sites available) 
number of sites available = range/2 × line density of science sites 

The architecture analysis attempted to minimize mass and maximize number of science 
sites visited, within constraints imposed by risk, extensibility, and robustness 
considerations. 

3.3 DRM-1 and DRM-2 Architectures Analysis 

3.3.1 DRM-1 Architecture Analysis 
The architecture choices for DRM-1 fulfilling the above assumptions and constraints are 
enumerated in Table 2 and Table 3.

* The UPV would be designed to hold two people. In this design, though, one of the UPVs would only hold 
one person, while the other would contain the nominal two person crew. 

The flow-down diagram in Figure 7 shows how these options are generated: here the red 
lines represent Mars, and the black lines represent the Moon. 

Figure 7: DRM-1 Architecture Options 

The independent variables in Table 4 were used for the architecture selection. For this 
analysis, rather than optimizing the power source internally in the model, we simply 
generated architecture variants for each type of power source.

For the lunar sortie mission, it was assumed that there were 5 days of exploration 
available, so the number of sites from a single DRM-1 excursion was multiplied by 5. 
Additionally, the power mass for consumable power systems was multiplied by 5, to 
reflect the need for additional fuel each day, in order to determine the total mass. 

Figure 8 shows the tradespace results generated for lunar vehicles, highlighting the Pareto 
front toward the upper left. The chart for Mars is similar. These charts show that the 
fewest number of vehicles (2) is preferable for both planets. Depending on mass 
requirements, the crew may all drive on the vehicles, or two crew members can walk. 
Fuel cells prove the most preferable power source. The details behind this model are 
documented in the Appendix. 

Figure 8: Moon Pareto Front Data 

Based on this analysis, the baseline architecture for the lunar DRM-1 is 2 UPVs, each 
nominally equipped to hold 2 crew. For Mars, with a crew of 6 , this is modified to 2 
UPVs each equipped to hold 3 crew, the most efficient option available. 

3.3.2 DRM-2 Architecture Analysis 
The DRM-2 analysis built on the DRM-1 analysis. For a DRM-2, the pressurized vehicle 
(whether a camper or a pressurized rover) is supported by multiple unpressurized 
vehicles. The astronauts use the pressurized vehicle to stay nights away from base, but all 
science work is accomplished using the unpressurized vehicles. The DRM-2 consists of 
long driving legs with the pressurized vehicles, punctuated by a series of DRM-1 sorties 
(Figure 9). In this analysis, the pressurized rover is sized to tow unpressurized vehicles, 
while the camper is towed by a stronger unpressurized vehicle. 

Figure 9: DRM-2 Operations Model 

Once again, the safety analysis outlined in Section 3.1 was used to shorten the list of 
potential architectures to a manageable number. For the pressurized vehicles, no crew 
member is ever alone for safety reasons. Again, the black lines in Figure 10 represent the 
Moon, the red lines represent Mars.

Figure 10: DRM-2 Architecture Choices 

Each of these options was tried with all logical configurations of unpressurized vehicles. 
For instance, 2 UPVs with 3 crew each are not able to tow 3 campers. For the campers, it 
was assumed one extra vehicle would scout in front of the towed vehicles. Table 7 lists 
the independent variables in the DRM-2 analysis:

In addition to those a series of dependent variables were specified. The dependent 
variables for the UPVs were the same as specified previously, with some variations. The 
UPVs for the camper had zero payload mass, but towed the full camper mass. A short list 
of the variables for the pressurized vehicles is presented in Table 8.

The cumulative number of sites was determined by adding the total number of sites 
visited over a trip of a given duration. The vehicles were then assumed to leave the day 
after they returned, so the number of sites were added up to the cumulative numbers 
above (roughly 1/3 of the expected stay for each of the planets: 60 days for the Moon, 
180 days for Mars). 

Due to the large number of architectural options, the tradespaces shown in Figure 11 and 
Figure 12 differentiate only the baseline choice (2 campers, 2 crew each) from the other 
architecture options. A more detailed look at the designs will be conducted in the 
sensitivity section (Section 3.4). 

Figure 11: Lunar DRM-2 Tradespace 

Figure 12: Mars DRM-2 Tradespace 

These graphs suggest that the camper architecture is superior to that of the pressurized 
rover. Given that the designs are relatively similar, the most logical reason for this 
difference is that there is no repetition of the cockpit mass and steering mass in the 
camper system, like there is in the pressurized rover system. This reduction carries 
throughout the rest of the design, shrinking the chassis and the power system, to make the 
design more efficient. 

Once again, the general trend was towards having the fewest number of vehicles. In other 
words, it is cheaper from a mass perspective to put extra crew in one vehicle, as opposed 
to creating new vehicles for the crew. However, there was some concern about having 
only 1 pressurized element. In the case that that vehicle was no longer functioning, there 
would be no ability to conduct long-distance exploration. Given the harsh environments 
of both the Moon and Mars, it was deemed reasonable to set a minimum of 2 pressurized 
elements. There is indeed a mass penalty to be paid for this decision, but the cost is worth 
the redundancy the extra pressurized element affords. 

Extensibility played a role in the decision making process. Creating 2 campers with 3 
crew each may make sense on Mars, but not on the Moon with only 4 crew. Therefore, 
the decision was made to use 2 campers with 2 crew each as baseline design. This 
architecture provided the best exploration efficiency, redundancy, and extensibility. 
However, given the many assumptions that must be entered in the model, the decision 
was made to create a “delta” design to be compared to the baseline. This “delta” design 
was designated to be 2 pressurized rovers with 2 crew each. 

For the different environments (Moon, Mars, and Earth) the combined architectures are 
slightly different. On the Moon, there will be 3 UPVs accompanying the 2 pressurized 
elements. The reason for the extra UPV is to scout out ahead of the pressurized elements, 
helping to pick a reasonable path. 

This architecture is a common-sense approach that should allow for more rapid and safer 
travel. Pascal Lee used this system successfully in the Haughton-Mars project for 
bringing the Humvee to Devon Island, and it is sensible to accept his advice in this area. 
The architectures on both Mars and Earth involve a fourth UPV, in order to provide 
mobility to the crew members left behind during a traverse. In this manner, the crew can 
continue with infrastructure build-up and/or re-supply as necessary. Additionally, this 
extra UPV provides a spare in case one vehicle breaks down. The overall baseline 
decisions are summarized below.

Given the many assumptions inherent in this model, a sensitivity analysis was undertaken 
to verify the baseline choice. 

3.4 Architecture Sensitivity Analysis 

3.4.1 DRM-1 
The first step was deciding which elements to vary. For DRM-1, two variables were 
chosen as having a potentially large impact on the design: speed and range. The same 
steps were undertaken as outlined in 3.3 and the appendix with the exceptions outlined in 
this table:

The following figure shows the lunar DRM-1 speed graph, in which the range of values is 
from 8 to 18 km/hr by 2 km/hr increments. 

Figure 13: Lunar DRM-1 speed sensitivity 

From the speed sensitivity analysis, it can be shown that after about 14 km/hr is reached, 
the efficiency does not change considerably. The arrow points in the direction of 
increasing speed. From this graph, the baseline architecture is clearly superior, having the 
highest efficiency. 

For the range graph and analysis, see the Appendix. No graphs are presented for the Mars 
case, as there is expected to be no difference. Additionally, any trip to Mars is assumed to 
have a pressurized element due to the long stay times, so there is no analog to the lunar 
sortie mission where an analysis solely of a Mars DRM-1 option is necessary. It is clear 
that no change in the baseline architecture were needed for a lunar sortie mission. 

3.4.2 DRM-2 
For the DRM-2 architectures, 3 variables were chosen as relevant for conducting a 
sensitivity analysis, as seen in the following table. Otherwise, the same steps as outlined 
in the appendix were followed, with nominal values stated there.

Only the sortie day graphs will be represented here, while the others will be placed in the

appendix. The range graph is not a huge factor in mass (and due to the metric calculation


method is not very informative) while the speed graph does not provide significantly 
different results from the sortie days analysis, which is seen below. 

Figure 14: Lunar DRM-2 Sortie Days 

In this graph, the 2 camper, 4 crew architecture is not along the Pareto front, but rather is 
dominated by two architectures. It is important to realize that these architectures are only 
single pressurized vehicles. To increase redundancy, the extra vehicle is worth the mass 
penalty that is incurred, as discussed previously. The arrow points in the direction of 
increasing sortie days. 

Overall, the lunar sensitivity analysis shows no reason for a change in the baseline 
design. 

Figure 15: Mars DRM-2 Sortie Days 

For the sortie days, once again the camper baseline architecture is along the Pareto front. 
However, it is not the most efficient design, but those designs all include a greater 
number of crew. In order to keep the design extensible, it makes sense to stay with the 
baseline. Additionally, given the overall mass constraints for the mobility system, and the 
high-level nature of this study, some margin between the 15,000 kg limit is a very good 
idea. 

Once again, there is no need to change the architecture. 

3.5 Communications and Navigation 
The communications infrastructure is responsible for providing the transport of 
information from one asset to another in the planetary surface mobility system. This 
chapter overviews the proposed evolutionary architecture developed to meet the 
communications requirements and highlights the analysis performed to determine the 
feasibility of the architectural strategy. 

3.5.1 Architecture and Deployment Strategy 
The proposed architecture and communications deployment strategy is driven by the 
communications requirements (see the Communications & Navigation Appendix). The 
architecture and deployment study focused on the Moon as its case study. 

It was found that the best communications architecture depended on two key factors: 

•	 Mission class: Defined as the degree of Direct Earth coverage between lunar asset 
and at least one DSN station, assuming elevation angles of greater than 10 degrees, 
terrain grazing angles of greater than 5 degrees, and a lunar elevation angle of greater 
than 5 degrees. Figure 17 depicts the coverage map for the lunar surface. The lighter 
the color, the higher the duty cycle. The mission classes are defined as: 

•	 Continuous Direct Earth Coverage: 97% or better coverage over one year. 
•	 Cyclic Direct Earth Coverage, High Duty: Repeating, non-continuous access with 
greater than or equal to 50% duty over one year. 
•	 Cyclic Direct Earth Coverage, Low Duty: Repeating, non-continuous access with 
less than 50% duty over one year. 
•	 No Direct Earth Coverage: No access over one year. 

•	 “Hard” vs. “Soft” communication requirement: Missions requiring continuous, real-
time communications between the mobile asset and the Earth require a different 
minimal architecture than missions requiring only that the data be transported 
between the mobile asset and the Earth at some point. 

The Ground Network architecture as shown in Figure 16(a) was found to be the best 
communications architecture for the following independent situations: 
1.	 Continuous Direct Earth Coverage missions. 
2.  Nearside (anything other than No Direct Earth Coverage missions) with “Soft” 
communication requirement. 
3.	 Border Far-side missions with nearside communications base. 

The Full architecture in Figure 16(b) was found to be the best communications 
architecture for the following independent situations: 
1.	 No Direct Earth Coverage missions. 
2.  Near-side (anything other than No Direct Earth Coverage missions) with “Hard” 
communication requirement. 

Figure 16: Architecture with (a) ground relays, (b) ground and space relays 

Caveat: the communication requirements discussed in the Communications & Navigation 
Appendix imply that neither a ground network nor a space-based asset is required if the 

base and mobile asset remain in line-of-sight contact and the following independent 
conditions apply: 

1.	 Continuous Direct Earth Coverage missions. 
2.	 Nearside (anything but No Direct Earth Coverage missions) with “Soft”

communication requirement.


Furthermore, neither a ground network nor a space-based asset is required for Continuous 
Direct Earth Coverage missions even if the base and mobile asset don't maintain line-of­
sight contact so long as both assets can always communicate with Earth. 

Figure 17: Coverage map with potential lunar exploration sites 

Why not simply use direct-to-Earth for both base and mobile like Apollo? In some cases, 
this is indeed possible (as it was for Apollo). The elevation of the Earth above the horizon 
should be sufficient to mitigate terrain interference effects. The energy required to bridge 
the distance between the moon and Earth is significant and losing half the signal strength 
or more off the bat to terrain diffraction is a serious issue (which occurs if the top of the 
terrain is right at the line-of-sight path or higher). 

In the cases described above, if the landing site is chosen in a Continuous Direct Earth 
Coverage region and is placed well, then the base should have guaranteed direct-to-Earth 
connectivity. However, this is not necessarily the case for the mobile asset as it may 
encounter terrain that blocks not only its direct connectivity to the base but also to Earth. 
Depending on the stringency of the communication requirements, this may or may not be 
a serious issue. Here, it is assumed that the system must have continuous communications 
between the base and mobile asset regardless of line-of-sight. Thus, in cases where 
terrain effects are not inconsequential and the elevation of the Earth above the horizon is 
low, a ground network will likely be required to maintain connectivity. 

Even in instances where this is not the case, a ground network would provide 
communications redundancy and enable ground-based navigational capabilities. Also, 
placing the bulk of the communications equipment at the base rather than on the mobile 

allows the mobile asset to carry more scientific equipment and sample payload and 
enables higher-throughput communications back to Earth once the data arrives at the 
base. The precise benefits are not entirely clear, but there is sufficient motivation to 
consider architectures beyond Apollo-like and/or space-based constellations. 

Since the best architecture depends not only on the location of the assets but the per­
mission service requirements, the logical solution is to propose an evolving architecture. 

An evolving architecture would have the following deployment strategy: 

“What is needed, where it is needed, as it is needed.” 

3.5.2 Hypothesis of Strategy 
The feasibility of the communications architecture and deployment strategy strongly 
depends on whether a ground network can replace a space-based asset for planetary 
surface exploration. The hypothesis is that a ground network can provide comparable 
quality-of-service performance at a fraction of the price as compared to space-based 
assets. The remainder of this section will describe the first phase of hypothesis testing, 
where we investigate the number of relays, under a variety of conditions, which would be 
required to maintain connectivity to a lunar base. 

Analysis Overview 
Terrain data for the lunar surface were generated based on power spectral densities of 
several terrain types [Power]. These data sets represented terrain elevation for an area 2 
km x 2 km, where each pixel represented an area of 2 m x 2 m, and the data represented 
the number of meters above or below nominal (represented by an elevation of “0”). There 
were four types of terrain analyzed (in order of roughness): smooth mare, hummocky 
upland, rough mare, and rough upland terrain. 

Connectivity is determined by line-of-sight between a vehicle moving along the terrain 
and the relay network. Whenever a relay is deployed, the code calculates the visibility 
map of the relay; that is, the areas of the map that the relay can see. Whenever the vehicle 
moves outside this region, another relay is deployed. For multiple relays, the code keeps 
track of the cumulative visibility map, which is the area on the map that can be seen by 
any of the deployed relays. The line-of-sight tool los2 in the MATLAB Mapping Toolbox 
is used to calculate these visibility maps. 

3.5.3 Effect of Line-of-Sight Assumption on Received Energy 
The line-of-sight assumption in the MATLAB analysis results in a worst-case estimation 
of the number of relays to maintain network connectivity. The reason for this relates to 
the trade between communications range and received signal energy. MATLAB assigns 
line-of-sight connectivity if there are no obstacles in the straight-line path between the 
two locations as shown in Figure 18(a). If the top of an obstacle touches or is in the line-
of-sight path, no connectivity exists. This is a restrictive assumption, since in reality 
signals can propagate over obstacles through diffraction. 

According to the theory of single knife-edge diffraction, so long as an obstacle exists 
below the line-of-sight path, the received signal energy is approximately the same as the 
transmitted energy less the space loss due to distance (the distances considered here 
produce negligible space loss). If the top of the obstacle touches the line-of-sight path, 
then the received signal energy is half the transmitted energy and decreases steadily from 
there. This phenomenon can be seen in Figure 18(b), a plot of path loss relative to free 
space as a function of the Fresnel-Kirchhoff diffraction parameter [Parsons]. The boxed 
area is the signal strength variation as the top of the obstacle is brought closer and closer 
to the line-of-sight path but does not obstruct line-of-sight. In this case, the oscillations 
are small, and it is thus a reasonable approximation to assume the received energy is the 
same as the transmitted energy. When line-of-sight touches the top of a sharp obstacle, 
the path loss is 6 dB (half the signal strength). If line-of-sight is further obscured by the 
obstacle, the power loss increases [Parsons]. 

If the line-of-sight assumption is relaxed, however, the range of the transmitter will 
increase by enabling communications to areas on the far side of obstacles, but the 
received energy will be subject to knife-edge diffraction losses (Fresnel-Kirchhoff 
diffraction parameter greater than 0) as shown in Figure 18(b). This represents a new 
trade: rather than simply ensuring connectivity, the range of the system could be 
increased by taking advantage of terrain, but this would require increased signal power 
from the relays to compensate for the diffraction losses. This can be accomplished by 
adding an appropriate link margin. 

For this analysis, however, we are restricting connectivity to be based on line-of-sight 
only. Future work in this area would incorporate diffraction effects.

3.5.3 Parameter Study 
There are four parameters that are considered in the analysis to determine their effect on 
the number of relays required to maintain connectivity: 

1.  Terrain type: four terrain maps of varying roughness were used to measure the 
sensitivity of the required number of relays to terrain type. 

2.  Deployment strategy: when connectivity is lost and a relay must be deployed, the 
strategy determines where it is placed. 
3.  Relay height: the height of the relays impacts the areas with which they have line-
of-sign connectivity. 
4.  Start location: on the same map, take a random sampling of start points in order to 
measure how the actual local terrain, not just the type, influences the results. 

The metric used to compare simulations with different parameter values was the average 
distance between relays (meters / relay), which is a measure of how far one can travel 
before dropping another relay. 

3.5.4 Deployment Strategies 
There are two deployment strategies that were considered, which both rely on local 
terrain information to determine where to place the relays. 

Straight-Line Deployment 
In the straight-line deployment strategy, the vehicle travels in a straight line and 
continually checks if it has connectivity to a relay. If not, the vehicle drops a relay 
immediately behind it. This results in a string of relays in a line along the traverse path. 

This is perhaps the simplest deployment method possible because it does not require the 
astronauts to alter the drive path to deploy relays. The strategy is operationally simple, as 
the vehicle could be equipped with an autonomous relay deployment system that acts 
independently of the astronauts. The method, however, does not take advantage of local 
terrain. Often it would be advantageous to place relays at nearby hilltops when another 
relay is required. Thus this strategy represents the upper bound on the number of relays 
needed since terrain is not used to boost the visibility of the relays. 

Adaptive Deployment 
The adaptive deployment scheme also has the vehicle driving in a straight line, but when 
connectivity is lost, a relay is placed at the highest elevation point within a specified 
radius from the vehicle. This represents our first attempt at introducing the ability to use 
the local terrain to our advantage. By placing relays at higher locations, the number of 
relays would conceivably be decreased since each relay can see larger areas of the terrain. 

Alternate Strategies 
There are many other approaches that were not considered in this analysis due to time 
limitations, but they fall into two major types. First, the assumption that the vehicle 
travels in a straight line could be relaxed, so that the vehicle itself travels to high points 
on the terrain to better utilize local elevation to boost range. Second, the above methods 
rely on local terrain information that becomes available only when the vehicle is in the 
immediate area. If terrain elevation data were known in advance, the relay locations 
could be optimized prior to the traverse. Therefore, our analysis represents the upper 
bound on the number of relays required, as there are much more intelligent ways of 
placing relays along the terrain. 

Algorithm Details 
The program simulates a vehicle moving east along the terrain, which is a section of the 
large map data that is 300 m long and 40 m wide. The vehicle starts by deploying a 
communications relay and starts driving in a straight line due east. At each map data 
point (2 m resolution), the vehicle checks if it has line-of-sight with the relay and 
continues to move while it does. When connectivity is lost, the vehicle deploys a relay 
based on the selected deployment scheme. As the vehicle continues to traverse the map, it 
checks every 2 m whether it has connectivity to any of the previously deployed relays, 
and continues until it reaches the end of the map. 

The algorithm outputs the locations of the relays as placed by the vehicle on the surface. 
Figure 19 and Figure 20 illustrate the relay locations from one run on Hummocky Upland 
terrain with a relay height of 1 m and the straight-line deployment scheme. The colour 
scale indicates the elevation from nominal (+6m to –6m). 

Figure 19: Locations of relays on the terrain from one sample run. 

300 m 

Figure 20: Location of relays, 2D elevation view. 

In this particular run, a total of 12 relays were required to maintain connectivity 
throughout the traverse. The total distance between the first and last relays was 270 m, 
which gives a average distance / relay value of 22.5 m. This run suggests that 
approximately 44 relays with the properties listed above would be required for a 1 km 
traverse. 

The algorithm also checks the connectivity at each point on the map after all the relays 
are deployed, which is a measure of the overlap and robustness of the network. The 
connectivity maps are shown in Figure 21. 

The top image in Figure 21 shows the number of connections at each 2 m x 2 m pixel, 
which ranges from 0 (no connections) to 10. The bottom image shows in blue areas that 
have no connectivity. With some exceptions at the edges of the map, there are very few 

blind spots with no connection to any relay, and the sizes of these blind spots are on the 
order of only several meters. 

3.5.5 Parameter Study Results 
Four parameter studies were conducted to determine the effect of each parameter as 
discussed above. 

Figure 21: Connectivity maps of the sample run. 

Study 1: Map Location 
We ran the analysis with ten different start locations on the Hummocky Upland terrain 
map with one-meter relays, using the straight-line deployment strategy. The results show 
that on the same terrain type, the number of relays required has a large variance, which 
indicates the relay requirements are highly dependent not only on terrain type, but local 
elevation properties. 

Study 2: Terrain Types 
Using one-meter relays and the straight-line deployment strategy, we ran the analysis on 
the four different terrain types. The average distance between relays ranged from 11.4 m 
in the roughest terrain (Rough Upland), to 19.1 m in the smoothest terrain (Smooth Mare) 
as shown in Figure 22. The circles are the averages and the error bars show the minimum 
and maximum values for each terrain type. Thus the number of relays is highly dependent 
on terrain type, and even benign terrain will require a significant amount of relays. 

Study 3: Deployment Strategies 
With one-meter relays on Hummocky Upland terrain, we ran the analysis with both the 
straight-line and adaptive deployment strategies. Surprisingly, the straight-line strategy 
gave better results (average of 13.9 m/relay) than adaptive deployment (average of 11.4 
m/relay). We believe this was due to problems with coding the adaptive algorithm, since 
there is no reason why placing relays at local high points would be worse than simple 
straight-line deployment. 

The reason for the poor performance of the straight-line deployment is due to the fact that 
if a relay is dropped in any kind of depression, the vehicle will not travel far before it 
loses connection. This relay clustering effect can be seen several times in the relay 
location map in Figure 19. 

Figure 22: Average distance between relays for four terrain types 

Study 4: Relay Antenna Heights 
The code was then run for a range of relay antenna heights on the Hummocky Upland 
terrain data set. The results are shown in Figure 23, and suggest that the distance between 
relays scales linearly with relay height. In particular, the variance in the distance / relay 
metric increases dramatically for relay heights above 0.5 m. 

Figure 23: Average distance between relays as a function of relay height. 

3.5.6 Analysis Summary 
The communication over-the-horizon ground network evolution concept does not appear 
to be infeasible. The analysis represents a worst-case bound on the numbers and the 
parameter study shows that there are large variations in the number of relays required for 
relatively small changes in the parameters. The results strongly imply that better 
performance can be found if the design and deployment are intelligently constructed. If it 
had been found that there were very small variations in the number of relays, then the 
concept would likely be infeasible: the concept performs badly no matter what. 

Conclusion: the ground network concept does not appear to be infeasible. More 
work will need to be done to determine under what conditions it is feasible.

4. Mobility System Design 

4.1 Approach 

The objective of the vehicle design study was to define concepts for the each of the two 
vehicles (camper and UPV) in each of the three environments of interest (Moon, Mars, 
and Earth). Rather than separately designing six vehicles, the focus was placed on the 
lunar camper and lunar UPV. A commonality analysis was then done in which the 
penalties and benefits of adapting the lunar vehicle designs to different environments 
were assessed. From this analysis an estimate of the relative mass of the Earth and Mars 
vehicles was made. 

The vehicle design was done with the Terrain Vehicle Model (TVM), which is Matlab 
code created by the 16.89 students. Each subsystem was coded into a Matlab module, and 
then run iteratively until the vehicle properties converged to a design. The resultant lunar 
vehicle specifications were feed into MUSE. MUSE then provided a dynamic analysis of 
the vehicles’ capabilities. Based on feedback from MUSE, the inputs to the TVM were 
varied depending on if the capabilities of the vehicle turned out to be over designed. After 
iterations between MUSE and TVM, the Planetary Surface Vehicle (PSV) model was 
used to perform the commonality analysis across the Earth and Mars environments. 
Figure 25 shows a flow chart of the vehicle design process.

4.2 Assumptions 
A set of top level assumptions were made in the interest of reducing the number of design 
variables and simplifying the vehicle model. Additional assumptions were made on the 

subsystem level and documented in their respective sections of this document. Both the 
camper and UPV are nominally designed to carry 2 crew members. Both vehicles also 
have 4 wheels and an Aluminum structure and chassis. The camper ECLS subsystem is 
assumed to be able to regenerate water. To estimate the quantity of consumables needed, 
it is assumed that the camper will carry out 125 excursions, each of which has a 7 day 
duration. It is assumed that 4 of the 7 camper excursion days are spent driving, while the 
other 3 are spent performing DRM-1 operations away from the camper. For the purpose 
of sizing the power subsystem, it is assumed that the vehicles drive up to 12 hours per 
day. Finally, the camper is capable of driving itself, but not steering. The UPV must be 
able to provide steering to the camper, but not tow its weight. 

4.3 Subsystem Interactions 
The  Terrain  Vehicle  Model  (TVM)  written  by  the  16.89  students  consists  of  a  master 
script  that calls each  subsystem’s module in sequence. The order  in which  these modules 
are  run  as  well  as  the  flow  of  information  between  subsystems  is  shown  graphically  in 
Figure  26.  The  feedback  loops  in  the  sequence  are  handled  by  running  the  code  several 
times until the vehicle specifications converge.

4.4.1 Thermal Subsystem 
The inputs to the thermal subsystem are as follows: 

Driving time heat load 
Science time heat load 

Table 13 Thermal Inputs 
Vehicle surface area 
Radiator choice 

Using the environmental factors of solar flux, albedo reflection, and infrared (IR) 
emission in addition to the vehicle heat load determines the total heat that needs to be 
dissipated. Some of that heat is radiated through the thermal paint coatings over the 
camper. The remaining heat is radiated either through a vertical (bi-directional radiation) 
or horizontal (uni-directional radiation) radiator. Other components of the system include 
heat pumps, controls, fluids, plumbing, and multi-layer insulation (MLI). [Larson, 1999] 

The code (see Appendix) is set up to run the exact same procedures for Mars. It is 
assumed that the internal fluid workings would not need to change, just perhaps the size 
of the radiators. This design should be acceptable anywhere on Mars, and at the poles on 
the Moon, at any time. For equatorial latitudes on the Moon, the environmental 
influences may require an additional thermal dissipation system, such as a reusable phase 
change system. [Eckart, 1999] For Earth, the radiators could be replaced by a convection 
system. 

For the unpressurized elements, the design is similar. The same set of equations were 
used, but some louvers were added to protect sensitive equipment and a small phase 
change mass for heat dissipation in addition to the small radiators. These additions were 
based on the LRV, with information from a study on the Apollo 15 mission. [Costas, 
1972] 

The power is based on the amount of power required to punp the heat, and is seen in the 
vehicle design section for the camper (73 W or 87 W depending on situation). There is no 
power for the upv thermal system. The mass of each component of the thermal design for 
the Moon camper and upv is as follows:

4.4.2 Radiation Subsystem 
The radiation system is very dependent on environmental factors, namely Galactic 
Cosmic Radiation (GCR) and Solar Particle Events (SPE)s. NASA has developed levels 
of acceptable radiation, outlined in the NASA-STD-3000. The critical number analyzed 
here is a maximum 50 REM exposure per year. Again, from NASA-STD-3000 [NASA­
STD-3000], the average GCR at 1 AU was found to be 55 REM. The SPE was modeled 
after the six major events in 1989, which should be a conservative estimate. From the 
work of Wilson, et al. [Wilson 1997] a figure was found that identified various materials’ 
ability to stop GCR. The Lunar Base Handbook had a figure giving similar data for the 
1989 SPEs. [Eckart, 1999] 

In addition to the radiation shielding, the material already in the camper can help stop 
2
radiation. It was assumed that the airlock itself provided 4 g/cm in material. The entire 
vehicle structure, thermal components, etc., were assumed to stop an additional 5% of the 
SPE, a conservative estimate. Being low hydrogen materials, they would not stop any 
GCR, but rather cause cascading. The GCR total (55 REM) was divided by 1.75 to 
account for this occurrence, instead of by 2, since the Moon (or Mars) blocks half of the 
radiation value. 

For Earth, no shielding is necessary, so this subsystem should be designed to be easily 
removable. The GCR on Mars is approximately 58 REM [Beaty 2005], but the SPE is 
reduced due to the increased distance from the sun. The values for Mars for the SPE were 
simply reduced by ¼ as a conservative estimate, since very little is known about how 
much the atmosphere and magnetic field protect the planet. A delta can be calculated here 
so any changes can be made for the new environment.

4.4.3 Environmental Control and Life Support Subsystem 
The  purpose  of  the  ECLS  subsystem  is  to  provide  a  habitable  environment  for  the  crew 
during  surface  exploration.  Major  assumptions  concerning  the  ECLSS  included  the 
following: 
•	 Environmental control and life support is only required for the camper (see 
architecture selection above) 
o	 Design of space suits is beyond the system boundary 
•	 The camper is continuously operated for excursions of 1-2 weeks duration 
o	 This is an important factor because it defines the frequency of re-supply 
and regeneration at an outpost / base for the camper 
•  Over the lifetime of the camper, on the order of 100 such excursions can occur 
o	 This is an important factor for determining the overall consumables 
required. Different technologies and regeneration strategies will be 
favored for different # of excursions. 

The specific functions of the ECLS subsystem in our design are: 
•	 To provide atmosphere management by: 
o	 Storing oxygen and nitrogen 
o	 Feeding oxygen and nitrogen to the cabin atmosphere 
o	 Removing moisture from the cabin atmosphere 
o	 Remove carbon dioxide from the cabin atmosphere 
o	 Remove trace gases from the cabin atmosphere 
•	 To provide food / nutrition to the crew 
•	 To provide water management by 
o	 Storing water 
o	 Providing drinking water to the crew 
o	 Providing hygiene water to the crew 

Waste management functions, fire suppression, and crew accommodations and gear (such 
as  a  galley,  hygiene,  and  medical  facilities)  are  covered  in  the  human  activities 
subsystem. Temperature control of the cabin atmosphere is covered in the thermal control 
subsystem. 

Figure 27: Overview of major ECLSS architecture options in the form of a trade tree 

Figure 27 shows a trade tree for the ECLS system. Major architectural choices include: 
•	 The carbon dioxide removal mode: regenerative using SAWD / molecular sieves 
or expendable using LiOH 

•	 Oxygen regeneration: no regeneration or regeneration using waste water of waste 
CO2, and whether the regeneration is carried out on the camper itself or after 
return to the outpost (i.e. the waste products are stored on-board the vehicle and 
then regenerated at the base) 
•	 Waste water regeneration: whether water is regenerated using multi-filtration or 
not, and where the regeneration takes place 

The red arrows in Figure 27 indicate the results of early subsystem-level trades carried 
out during the design phase: 
•	 Regenerative CO2 removal is absolutely necessary because the LiOH ass and 
volume requirements for expendable CO2 removal are prohibitive. A molecular 
sieve system was preferred over SAWD, because the latter also removes and 
subsequently rejects water overboard which would then no longer be available for 
regeneration. For Mars, the molecular sieve can not be simply connected to the 
outside for evacuation of CO2 because the CO2 partial pressure of the Martian 
atmosphere is too high. In this case, a vacuum pump and a storage tank are 
required for CO2 removal from the sieves. The waste CO2 can then be pumped 
into a high-pressure tank and released to the Martian atmosphere from there. 
•	 O2 regeneration was considered but rejected because of the limited impact on re­
supply and the significant power requirements (several hundred W for 2 crew) 
which would have to be satisfied continuously. Should that power be available, it 
would likely have more impact when invested into O2 ISCP at the outpost than 
continuously on the camper. 
•	 Water regeneration using multi-filtration is comparatively cheap in terms of mass 
and power (about 80 W for 2 crew) and has a significant impact on the re-supply 
mass (more than 50 % of the daily consumables required are water). It was 
therefore decided to baseline water regeneration. 

Figure 28  shows  a  black  box  view of  a parametric ECLSS model  that was  created  in  the 
form  of  a Matlab  script.  The model was  integrated with  other  subsystem  codes  and  used 
for vehicle level design (see below). 

Figure 28: Black box view of the Matlab ECLSS model 

The mode takes  the # of crew, duration of  the excursion before return  to  the outpost, # of

excursions  over  the  lifetime  of  the  system  /  exploration  program,  and  the  water


regeneration type (actually location: outpost or vehicle), and provides cumulative ECLSS 
mass,  power,  heat  power  to  reject,  and  volume  on  the  vehicle  and  at  the  outpost.  The 
outpost  outputs  were  intended  to  enable  a  holistic  comparison  of  vehicle  designs  taking 
into account recharging and re-stocking of the mobility elements at the outpost. 

Using  the  above  model,  it  was  determined  that  water  regeneration  on  the  camper  was 
preferable because of  the  low power, mass, and volume requirements. Figure 29 provides 
an  overview  of  the  baseline  ECLSS  design  and  some  ECLSS  components  in  use  on  the 
shuttle  and  the  ISS;  these  components  could  potentially serve  as  legacy elements  for  use 
on the camper. 

Figure 29: Baseline ECLSS architecture / design and existing components from ISS / shuttle that 
could in principle be used as legacy elements 

The  baseline  ECLSS  design  provides  the  crew  with  oxygen  from  high-pressure  tanks. 
The normal atmospheric pressure  is set at 10.2 psi to  limit pre-breathing time for EVA  to 
a  maximum  of  one  hour.  The  differential  between  the  oxygen  partial  pressure  and  10.2 
psi is provided using nitrogen stored in high-pressure gas tanks. CO2 is removed from the 
atmosphere  using  molecular  sieves  like  those  on  Skylab.  Water  is  removed  from  the 
atmosphere  using  a  condensing  heat  exchanger;  the  condensate  water  is  stored  for 
regeneration. 80 % of  the waste water on-board  the camper  is  regenerated,  the  remaining 
20 % are expendable. This means that most of the drinking water is non-recycled. 

The design described above was a  lunar camper ECLSS point design. Figure 30 provides 
an  overview  of  ECLSS  functionality  required  for  the  other  two  use  cases  on  the  Earth, 
and  on  Mars.  For  use  on  Earth,  the  camper  need  not  provide  atmosphere  management, 
because  equalization  with  the  outside  atmosphere  will  take  care  of  CO2  partial  pressure 
and  provision  of  oxygen;  if  the  camper  crew  compartment  is  hermetically  sealed  on 
Earth,  then  equalization  valves  would  have  to  be  included.  For  use  on  Earth  in  a  remote 
environment,  the  camper  still  needs  to  provide  food  and  water  for  the  crew,  and 
potentially water regeneration. 
For  use  on  Mars,  the  camper  needs  to  provide  the  same  functions  as  for  the  lunar  use 
case. As mentioned above, CO2 rejection to the outside is more difficult on Mars because 

of  the  CO2  atmosphere  and  requires  additional  pumps  and  storage  devices.  These  have 
been taken into account for sizing the Mars ECLSS. 

Figure 30: Functional extensibility matrix for camper ECLSS with Earth, Moon, and Mars use cases 

Based on Figure 30 and the analysis presented above, it appears that ECLSS 
commonality / platforming between Earth / Moon / Mars campers is comparatively 
straightforward if the following two requirements are considered during design: 
•	 Scarring of the lunar CO2 removal system for addition of a vacuum pump and 
CO2 storage and rejection system for use on Mars 
•	 Modularization of the atmosphere management functionality / equipment so that it 
can be easily removed for use of the camper ECLSS on Earth. 

Future work in camper ECLSS could include: 
•	 Analysis of the impact of ISCP at a lunar and Mars outpost 
•	
Integration / interaction / commonality of the camper ECLSS with the EVA suit 
ECLSS; analysis of the potential for mass and risk reduction 

4.4.4 Power Subsystem 
The power subsystem function was to meet the power needs of each of the 
subsystems. From the results of the architecture study, primary fuel cells were baselined 
as the energy source. The power subsystem code worked by reading in the power needs 
of each subsystem in different power modes, computing the energy required, and sizing 
the energy storage. The power distribution and control mass was sized using the peak 
power from the driving mode. 
For the case of the long traverse, the pressurized elements held the fuel cells for 
the unpressurized elements. By providing the majority of the power, the unpressurized 
elements could be less massive for more efficient science exploration. 
The major trades for the subsystem were the methods of power generation and 
energy storage. The candidates for energy storage were batteries and fuel cells, and from 
the architectural analysis fuel cells were chosen. The possible methods of power 
generation were solar arrays and radioisotope thermal generators, and the functionality to 
handle these were in the power subsystem model. However, due to time constraints and 
complexity, this trade study was not fully carried out, and fuel cells as a primary source 
were used. 

The inputs to the power subsystem were the power requirements for the driving 
mode, science mode, and standing mode. Also the time spent driving in a day, and the 
numbers of science days, driving days, and total days were inputs. This would allow for 
calculation of the energy required. Finally the number and energy requirements of the 
unpressurized vehicles were inputs, and would come from running the vehicle model for 
the unpressurized case. 
The outputs of the power subsystem were the mass and volume of the power 
equipment. The mass distribution of the subsystem between the pressurized and 
unpressurized elements was also an output. The thermal power to be dissipated was an 
output of the power subsystem, and was a function of the power needs. The water 
produced by the fuel cells was an output so that the water could be used by the ECLS or 
radiation shielding subsystems. Finally, the capabilities of the power subsystem were 
outputs to be used by MUSE. 

4.4.5 Human Activities Subsystem 

Description 

Purpose 
The Human Activities Module calculates the volume, mass, and power necessary to 
support normal human activities in the course of an excursion. It further determines the 
inner length and radius of the cylindrical habitat. The concepts considered for this model 
are distinct from general life-support systems. Table 17 lists the activities and items 
covered by this module.

Assumptions 
We made several assumptions in designing the human activities module. 

Kitchen 
To save on weight and volume we assumed no kitchen in the camper. Instead the crew 
will eat MRE-style meals 

Sleeping 
Instead of designing fixed sleeping births, we assume the crew will sleep in hammocks 
hung across the width of the camper. These hammocks would be setup at night and 
stowed during the day. 

Living Space 
The living space is assumed rectangular except for the ceiling which is bounded by the 
curved inner roof of the camper shell. The minimum standing height in the center of the 
camper is 2.15 meters which is based on a maximum crew height of 74 inches plus a 10.6 
inch allowance for extra height due to the EVA suits. Further, the floor width is fixed at 
three meters. See Figure 31. 

Figure 31: Crew compartment geometry 

Space Division 
The space inside the camper shell is split into living space and storage space. Since the 
camper is cylindrical and the living space is rectangular, all the space between the living 
space and the camper shell is considered storage space for things like water, food, 
supplies, etc.

Function 

Power, Mass, and Volume 
Power, mass, and volume are calculated by integrating the amounts of each item needed 
for human activities for the number of crew specified over the period of the excursion 
and given the number of EVAs. These calculations are straight-forward and consistent. 
The volume calculation is split into living space volume and storage volume. Items that 
are stored, such as personal gear, water, etc. are added to storage volume; whereas 
structural items, living space, etc. are added to living space. These two volumes together 
set the lower bound on the cylinder’s internal volume and separately set the lower bounds 
on the living space volume and storage space volume. These volumes are then used in the 
optimization described below to determine the radius and length of the cylinder. 

Optimization 
To  determine  the  radius  and  length  of  the  cylinder  the  HA  module  performs  an 
optimization with  the objective of minimizing the difference between  the  total volume as 
calculated  by  the  objective  function  variables  and  the  specified  total  volume  determined 
by  summing  the  above  determined  living  space  and  storage  volumes.  Please  reference

The steering module is simple and assumes Ackerman steering for the vehicle. It models 
the mass of steering motor required for each steered wheel with additional linkages. The 
additional mass is estimated to be 4 kg based on data of electrically powered steering 
system in current vehicle. [1] It is also assumed that steer-by-wire system is on the 
vehicle. 

The motor power is modeled as: 
Pm  = 960 /(1600 × 0.8)m s 
where Pm  is motor power in Watts and ms  is sprung mass representing vehicle body mass 
in kg. The equation is based on an empirical data. [2, 3] The motor mass is then obtained 
from another empirical model based on masses of current motors. 

The wheel turn angle is assumed to be 50°. Ackerman steering holds the following 
equation: 

l 
cot α =  t  + cot β 
l b 
l 
sin α =  b 
Rt 
where, α is the turning radius, β is the wheel turn angle, lt  is the wheel track, and lb  is the 
wheel base. [4] (Fitch, 1994)

The suspension module takes a sprung mass, unsprung mass, and tire stiffness as inputs

4.4.10 Chassis subsystem 
There are two chassis subsystem in TVM; one for the camper and one for the 
unpressurized vehicle (UPV). The camper chassis is modeled after a ladder chassis while 
the UPV chassis has an additional railing to provide extra support. The primary 
requirement of this subsystem is that it must to able to support the vehicle during normal 
operations, contingencies and in an accident. It must also provide enough volume to 
house the different subsystems along with the crew compartment in the case of the 
camper. In addition, the chassis acts as an integrating station for all the various 
subsystems. 

Assumptions 
This model sizes the chassis based on the dimensions of the crew station and the 
total mass it will have to carry. The model for the camper assumes a ladder chassis 
design. Similarly the model for the UPV assumes a ladder chassis with the addition of a 
center railing to supply additional support. The loading is also assumed to be vertically 
distributed uniformly along the chassis. As a result the beam thickness can be calculated 
by assuming a maximum allowable deflection of 0.02m. The following equations are 
from Beer, 2002. 

1 4 
•  Moment of Inertia equation for a square cross-section:  I  = 
t  where I is the 
12 
moment of inertia and t is the width of the square cross-section. 

•  Maximum deflection equation for a uniformly loaded beam:  x = 

5wL 4 
384 EI 
is the absolute maximum vertical deflection, w is the total load force (total mass


where x 

•  Maximum horizontal force:  F  = 

times gravity), L is the effective length of the chassis, E is the Young’s modulus 
of the material, and I is the moment of Inertia. 
Ext 2 
L 
E is the material’s young’s modulus, x is the deflection, t is the width of the beam, 
and L is the total length of the chassis. 
•  Maximum deflection due to moment loading at the edge of the chassis: 
ML 2 

where F is the maximum horizontal force, 

39 
EI 
is the length of the chassis, E is the young’s modulus of the material and I is the 
beam’s moment of Inertia. 
The last two equations are used to calculate the maximum allowable horizontal 
force and moment applicable to the chassis before failure. This provides a high level 
analysis of the chassis’s ability to perform DRM 3 and DRM 4 operations. 

x 

= 

where x is the maximum deflection in the chassis, M is the moment, L 

Furthermore, this model does not assume the different types of dynamic failure 
modes, such as vibrations, horizontal, and dynamic loading. In addition, the chassis 
subsystem does not include stress concentration loads, especially at welds and interfaces. 
However, this model does incorporate an additional five percent of mass for design 
growth. For future works, this module can be integrated with MUSE to analyze what kind 
of loading forces will be experienced by the chassis while traversing on actual terrain. 

The chassis module also assumes a stability grade of π / 4 since the LRV had a 
requirement to be statically stable on a 45 degree slope. The wheel factor is 1 for the 
camper. Furthermore, the track of the wheel is approximately 1.07 times the diameter of 
the wheel. The wheel base is then the maximum between the length of the crew 
compartment and (2 x (wheel diameter) + (distance between wheels)). In addition to these 
assumptions, the UPV chassis module assumes that it can hold up to four astronauts. The 
UPV chassis module also accounts for the human interfaces with the vehicle and its 
geometry. 

Description 
The chassis subsystem is consisting of square cross-section side rails and cross 
bars. The camper chassis currently has two side rails and three cross bars. The UPV 
chassis has three side rails (one additional rail in the middle) and three cross bars. This 
module also calculates the free volume left in the chassis and in the space between the 
structural shell and the bottom of the chassis. This free volume calculation is useful in 
allotting payload sample and equipment volumes. 
The material of the camper and UPV chassis are currently a form of Ti-alloy. 
(Although this is the current material setting, the material type is actually a design 
variable. A wide range of material choices is provided by the material database.) 
Furthermore, both the camper and UPV chassis incorporated a 5% mass allocation for 
future design growth. The UPV chassis will have the ability to support construction and 
resupply operations. 

Design variables 
Design variables include the material selection for the chassis. The planet’s 
gravity is also a design variable in this module. For the UPV, the number of crews on the 
vehicle is another design variable. In addition, the chassis is affected by the geometry and 
ladder configuration. The stability grade and the maximum allowable deflection are also 
parameters that the chassis needs to be designed around. 

Options 
Materials 
Materials for the chassis may include: aluminum alloys, different types of steel, 
Titanium, magnesium alloy, carbon/graphite/glass or other types of composites. 

Chassis geometry 
In this module, the chassis is representative of a ladder chassis frame. There are 
however, many different options for chassis designs. For example, a chassis can be 
designed with a box frame or in an “I” shape. The cross-section profile of the chassis 
members can also vary in design. The different chassis members can be “I” beams, 
completely solid, have a hollow middle, and so forth. 
The chassis can also be designed for interchangeable modules or it can be 
designed for integrated components. The former allows for a wider range of use for the 
chassis but will be more complicated to develop. Furthermore, a universal chassis design 
can be a baseline for multiple platforms. As a result, different consumables, such as 
power and water, can be swapped in and out of the chassis depending on the need and the 
mission. With a common chassis, DRM 1’s, resupply, and logistic operations can take 
advantage of customizing consumables depending on the specific terrain traveled. 
A foldable chassis design is also an option. A foldable chassis allows for easier 
transportation of the system but makes the system much more complicated. A uniform 
chassis is easier to build but might be more difficult to transport. 

Design considerations 
The current design chose to follow a ladder frame template because the ladder 
chassis provides excellent structural support from vertical loads and provides different 
compartments for the various other subsystems. The chassis module currently assumes 
the beams to be solid Ti-alloy beams. The simplicity of the beam geometry allows for 
ease of machinability. Furthermore, using Ti-alloy allows the chassis to carry the desired 
loads with little weight penalty. The disadvantage is that using Ti-alloy might result in 
high cost. 
In addition, the UPV chassis is designed to be foldable. This makes the vehicle 
easier to transport. Although having a foldable chassis affects the total strength of the 
system, the chassis will have additional structural reinforcements especially at the joints. 
For simplicity, this model will consider that the foldable chassis will behave similarly to 
a solid chassis. In addition, the mass growth allocation for this system is five percent. 
Further work can be done on modeling the folding joint on the UPV chassis. 

Interfaces 
Inputs 

The inputs for the structure subsystem primarily come from the human activity 
module. This includes the radius and length of the crew compartment. The wheel 
diameter and total mass (the chassis will have to support) are also important inputs. In 
addition, the external environment conditions are inputs to this module. 

Outputs 
The outputs of this module are total chassis mass, chassis volume, thickness of the 
chassis beams, wheel base, track and the free volume between the chassis and volume. 

Interfaces 
The chassis module interfaces directly with the human activities, payload, 
structures and propulsions. In addition, the chassis is affected by each of the other 
subsystem because the chassis will need to support the load generated by all the different 
systems, except propulsion. 

Sensitivity to different planet environments 
Analyzing how the structure subsystem will change in different planetary 
environments is fairly straight forward. The major factors that will affect this subsystem 
are the gravity on the different planets. The gravity will affect the structure of the chassis. 
The thickness or mass of the chassis scales with the intensity of the gravity. The terrain of 
the planet can also affect how much horizontal and vibration loads are placed on the 
chassis.

4.4.11 Structure subsystem 
The structure subsystem in this design is the outer frame of the crew 
compartment. Hence, this subsystem is only applicable to the camper. The structure 
subsystem includes the shell and skeleton frame of the vehicle. The primary requirement 
of this subsystem is that it must keep the crew safe from the external environment under 
normal operations, contingencies and in an accident. 

Assumptions 
This model sizes the structural shell thickness on the pressure difference between 
the internal and external environment. This dimension does not include the volume 
needed for thermal insulation and radiation protection. The thickness of the shell (t) is 
Pr 
calculated by the hoop stress relationship (Beer, 2002):  t  = 
σ / sf 
difference between the internal and external environment, r is the radius of the shell, σ is 
the stress and sf is the safety factor (in this model it is set at 4). 
Furthermore, this model does not assume the different types of dynamic failure 
modes, such as vibrations and dynamic radial loading. In addition, the structure 
subsystem does not include stress concentration loads, especially at the doors and 

where P is the pressure 

interfaces. (Realistically, the wall thickness will vary and have to take into account stress 
points around airlocks, hatches, windows, equipment attachments, support and 
suspension for wheels, bending stresses due to terrain and concentrated loads from 
bumping, accidents, collisions and roll-overs.) However, this model does incorporate an 
additional five percent of mass for design growth. For future works, this module can be 
integrated with MUSE to analyze what kind of loading forces will be experienced by the 
structure while traversing on actual terrain. 

Description 
The shell is supported by a frame consisting of six horizontal support beams and 
four cross-section ribs. The beams and ribs have a 0.05m by 0.1m cross-section area. 
Furthermore, the cabin floor is assumed to have a thickness of 0.06m. In this model the 
number of supports and cross-section areas are based on airplane specifications. The floor 
thickness is also modeled from current vehicle designs. The internal crew compartment 
pressure is set at 10.2 psi (0.694 atm) for Moon and Mars operations. On Earth, this 
model assumes that the shell thickness is approximately 0.05m (this thickness is an 
approximation of a U-haul wall). 
The skeleton frame material is currently Al-2219 and the shell material is Al ­
7075. Although this is the current material setting, the material type is actually a design 
variable. A wide range of material choices is provided by the material database. 

Design variables 
Design variables include the material selection for the shell structure and skeleton 
frame. The internal and external pressures are also design variables in this module. In 
addition, the structures are affected by the geometry and cross-sections of the skeleton 
frame. The thickness of the floor and the stress safety factors can also be modified within 
the code to accommodate for different loading conditions. Furthermore, this model 
allocates a five percent mass increase for design growth. 

Options 
Materials 
Materials for the frame may include: aluminum alloys, different types of steel, 
Titanium, magnesium alloy, Carbon/graphite/glass or other types of composites. 
Materials for the shell may include: aluminum honeycomb, aluminum sheets or various 
composite materials. 

Structural geometry 
In this module, the structural shell design for the pressurized vessel will be the 
most important feature to look at. The shell can be any geometric shape given that it is 
transportable to its destination. For example, the shell can have flat walls, curved walls or 
both. However, in general, spheres, ellipsoids, and cylinders with spherical or elliptical 
ends are lighter per unit volume than shells with flat sides. Although shells with flat sides 
need more reinforced walls, they can provide more efficient external and internal packing 
space. Constructing a vehicle with flat sides also tend to be easier than a cylindrical 
vehicle. 

Design considerations 
Although there are different options for the structural geometry for the shell, this 
module selected to pursue a cylindrical design. The pressure differences greatly affect the 
thickness and overall mass of the vehicle. In order to minimize total system mass, a 
cylindrical geometry was chosen. The internal crew compartment is designed to optimize 
crew volume by allotting empty spaces for storage. 
The environment interfaces is another area for trade analysis. Different options for 
interfacing with the environment include an inflatable airlock, slip-on EVA suits, 
detachable airlock module or an integrated crew airlock. The last option was selected 
because it is the most mass efficient solutions. The integrated airlock will also serve as 
the crew sleeping quarters thereby reducing the amount of total radiation shielding over 
the complete vehicle. Furthermore, this reduces a lot of the complexities that would have 
been involved in interfacing with an inflatable airlock or slip-on suit. 

Interfaces 
Inputs 
The inputs for the structure subsystem primarily come from the human activity 
module. This includes the radius and length of the crew compartment. The floor width 
and the maximum vertical distance in the crew compartment are also inputs. In addition, 
the external environment conditions are inputs to this module. 

Outputs 
The outputs of this module are total structure mass, including the shell and 
skeleton frame, overall shell volume, the surface area needed for radiation shielding and 
the surface area needed for the thermal system. 

Interfaces 
The structure module interfaces directly with the human activities, thermal and 
radiation subsystems. The total structure geometry and mass is also used by the chassis 
subsystem. 

Sensitivity to different planet environments 
Analyzing how the structure subsystem will change in different planetary 
environments is fairly straight forward. The major factors that will affect this subsystem 
are the external environmental pressure and gravity. The external pressure will affect the 
thickness of the shell. The shell thickness scales directly with the absolute pressure 
difference, given the other variables in the hoop stress equation remains constant. 
Changes in gravity will affect the severity of loading on and by the structure.

4.4.13 Vehicle Communications Model 
The communications model built for the vehicle design is based primarily on sizing two 
link budgets: direct communications with TDRSS and surface communications. 

Assumptions 
The communications model incorporates the following assumptions: 

1.	 The camper will carry two antennas: one for direct-to-TDRSS communications 
and one for surface communications. 
2.	 The UPV will carry a single antenna for surface communications. 

3.	 The antennas operate in the S-band frequency range; the low frequency helps 
minimize diffraction losses. 
4.	 The user data rate is 1 Mbps (this represents the total bandwidth). 
5.	 The link margins are 10 dB for direct-to-TDRSS and 20 dB for surface. 
6.	 The effective antenna diameter for the direct-to-TDRSS antenna is 0.5 m and 0.01 
m for the surface communications. 

The gain for the TDRSS satellite in S-band was estimated to be 39.7 dB. 

Mass Sizing 
The antenna mass is based on spacecraft antenna mass sizing used in Darren Chang’s 
Masters thesis [Springmann]. This sizing relation is based on Table 13-16 in SMAD: 

Mass = 2 × 9.173(Effective Antenna Diameter )1.403 
A factor of 1.5 was included to account for mounting equipment and other masses 
associated with including it on a surface vehicle. The communications hardware mass 
was assumed to be included in the avionics mass budget. 

Power Sizing 
The transmit power was found using the link budget analysis outlined in Chapter 13 of 
SMAD. It was assumed that the power required for communications was 1.5 times the 
power required for communicating (direct power and surface power for the camper, 
surface power only for the UPV). 

Volume 
It was assumed that antenna volume was not directly related to the vehicle design since 
the antennas would be mounted to the top of the vehicles. Communications hardware 
volume was accounted for in the avionics volume budget.

4.6 Visualization, Geometric Design 
Based on  the vehicle design data (mass, geometry), drawings of  the UPV and  the camper 
elements were  created  using  2D-CAD.  The  primary  purpose  of  geometric  design was  to 
provide  a  baseline  concept  for  the  geometrical  arrangement  of  vehicle  subsystems,  a 
comparison  of  the  UPV  and  camper  in  size  and  shape,  demonstration  of  UPV  /  camper 
interfacing  for  DRM-2,  and  documentation  for  efficient  visual  communications  of  our 
architecture  choice  and  operations  concept  (also  suitable  for  future  outreach  activities). 
The design concepts for the camper and UPV presented here naturally only represent two 
possible  instances;  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  geometrical  designs  using  3D  virtual 
mock-ups was beyond the scope of this project and is considered part of future work. 

4.6.1 UPV Geometric Design 
The  UPV  is  intended  both  as  an  independent  vehicle  for  short-range  exploration  and 
scouting, and as a guiding vehicle for the camper for long-range traverses. Also, the UPV 
is  intended  for  use  during  lunar  sortie  missions,  and  therefore  has  to  be  transportable 
within  the  human  lunar  lander  cargo  capacities  (transportation  constraints  on  the  UPV 
design  for  the  Earth  analog  use  case  were  eliminated  by  choosing  the  use  of  regular 
ATVs  as  a  UPV  substitute).  Although  the  UPV  is  nominally  used  only  with  2  crew  it 
needs to be capable of transporting 4 crew (and no exploration cargo) in an emergency. 
 

Figure 40: Annotated drawings for the Unpressurized Vehicle (UPV); side view folded position, side 
view deployed position, top view. 

Figure 40 provides drawings for the UPV created using a 2D-drafting program. The UPV 
is  shown  in  side  view  (folded  and  deployed  position)  and  top  view.  The  UPV  chassis  is 
divided  into  three  frames which  are  connected  serially using hinges  and  (in  the  deployed 
position)  a  locking  mechanism;  the  configuration  is  intended  to  be  deployed  once.  The 
weight force together with the locking mechanism ensures that the chassis stays deployed 
(self-helping mechanism); thus no springs or active control are required. Also, the wheels 
do not have to be folded in (as for the Apollo LRV), resulting in a significant reduction in 
complexity  compared  to  the  LRV.  In  the  folded  configuration,  the  UPV  requires  a 
volume  envelope  of  1.8  m  x  3m  x  2m;  this  should  be  within  the  cargo  envelope  pf  the 
human  lunar  lander.  If  a  significantly  smaller  envelope  is  required,  the  vehicle  could 
potentially  be  disassembled  at  the  hinge  joints  and  stowed  in  pieces  aboard  the  lunar 
lander.  This  would,  however,  also  require  a  one-time  reconnection  of  power  to  the  front 
wheel  drive  motors  from  the  fuel  cell  units  on  the  lunar  surface  because  the  fuel  cell 
power plants are located in the middle chassis unit. 

The  chassis  serves  as  “bus”  elements  that  nearly  all  other  elements  of  the UPV  interface 
with.  The  front  chassis  section  is  connected  to  the  suspensions  for  the  front  wheels,  and 
provides  crew  displays,  a  crew  station  for  vehicle  control,  two  seats  for  primary 
accommodation of astronauts, and capacitive  thermal control units under  the seats. These 
units store waste heat for  the duration of one EVA. After conclusion of the excursion, the 
front  seats  are  rotated  up,  and  the  thermal  radiator  dust  covers  removed  so  that  the 
radiators can dissipate heat to space. 

The  middle  chasses  section  serves  as  connecting  element  for  the  front  and  rear  chassis 
elements  and  also  houses  the  fuel  cell  power  plants with  associated  consumables  storage 
(hydrogen. oxygen). Power  is  generated  in  the  fuel  cells  and  then  fed  to  the drive motors 
through electrical connections along the chassis frames. The rear chassis provides another 
two seats which house crew gear and scientific instruments during nominal operations.  In 
a  contingency  situation,  these  items  are  offloaded  and  the  two  spare  seats  would  be 
occupied by two  additional  crew members. The  rear chassis  also houses  communications 
equipment  for  direct  communications  to  Earth  via  a  steerable  high-gain  antenna.  It  also 
provides attachment for the UPV / camper interface. 

4.6.2 Camper Geometric Design 
Given  the  mass  and  geometry  data  from  the  design  analysis,  a  conceptual  design  was 
created  for  the  planetary  camper  with  focus  on  the  lunar  version.  As  for  the  UPV,  it  is 
necessary  to  stress  that  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  the  configuration  space was  beyond 
the scope of the class design effort. Figure 41 provides an overview of the camper design 
with back and side view drawings. 

Figure 41: Camper drawings, back and side view 

The  camper  design  is  fundamentally  different  from  the  UPV  because  it  includes  a  crew 
compartment  that  provides  a  shirtsleeve  environment  for  the  crew  for  intra-vehicular 
operations  and  regeneration between driving periods  and  exploration EVAs. The original 
preferred  crew  compartment  form  was  cylindrical  with  a  radius  of  1.63  m;  as  the  ESAS 
LSAM  crew  compartment  was  baselined  with  a  1.5  m  radius,  the  camper  crew 
compartment radius was adapted to 1.5 m in order to enable commonality of the two crew 
compartments.  This  commonality  might  provide  an  interesting  option  for  reducing 
development work required and should be investigated further. 

Like  the  UPV  design,  the  camper  features  a  chassis  which  serves  as  “bus”  element  with 
interfaces  to  most  of  the  other  subsystems.  The  chassis  is  directly  connected  to  the 

suspension  and  drive  systems  for  the  four wheels.  The  chassis  also  serves  as  attachment 
point  for  the  cradle-like  mechanism  that  provides  attachment  for  the  crew  compartment; 
this attachment method was modeled after  the attachment of modules  in  the space shuttle 
payload bay. 
Directly  attached  to  chassis  is  also  an  equipment  module  which  provides  subsystem 
equipment  for  communications,  thermal  control,  fuel  cells  for  camper  drive  power, 
hydrogen, oxygen, and water storage, and attachment for the vertical thermal radiator and 
the  steerable  high-gain  antenna.  The  radiator  features  a  sun-shield  in  order  to  eliminate 
heat input from the lunar surface into the radiator. 

Attached  to  the  chassis  is  also  the  camper  part  of  the  UPV/camper  interface;  Figure  42 
shows the connected configuration for DRM-2 traverses: 

Figure 42: UPV–camper DRM-2 traverse configuration

section (see below). 

5. Integrated Dynamic Capability Analysis 

5.1 Overview 
The Mission Utility Simulation Environment (MUSE) is a simulation tool that takes the 
vehicle design parameters and evaluates the performance of the design on representative 
terrain on the planetary surface. 

In Chapter 3, the architectural selection had two metrics that were used to determine the 
optimal architecture: vehicle wet mass and number of science sites that could be visited. 
The vehicle design model was able to provide a mass estimate, and MUSE calculates the 
total number of sites that can be visited for both DRM-1 and DRM-2 operations. Over the 
course of the project, MUSE evaluated the vehicle point designs on lunar terrain only; 
future work could include Mars and/or Earth. 

MUSE provides three main benefits to the vehicle design process. First, the vehicle 
model uses various static assumptions about the average or worst-case quantities that will 
be encountered on the planetary surface, such as slopes or power draw under certain 
situations. MUSE aims to add a dynamic analysis capability, whereby the consumable 
use is dependent on local terrain as the vehicles move across the lunar landscape. 

Second, the results of MUSE will also provide valuable feedback to the vehicle design 
team. It may be that the vehicle design did not fare as well as anticipated on the 
representative terrain. This can either be attributed to issues in the code or unanticipated 
terrain effects. MUSE can aid the vehicle design team in generating better point designs. 

Finally, the results could point to modularity opportunities for consumable storage, 
especially between the camper and the UPV for different missions. Strategies for storing 
consumables in easily swappable chunks may become apparent when the vehicle design 
is run over many missions in different terrain environments. 

This chapter provides an overview to the MUSE methodology and the results when 
MUSE was run with the latest point design provided by the vehicle design team. 

5.2 Methodology 
The MUSE model incorporates several methods and sources of data in order to simulate, 
to a reasonable degree of accuracy, operations on the lunar surface. The following section 
details the main methods used to simulate exploration on the Moon. 

5.2.1 Exploration Strategy 
Exploration of nearby sites on a DRM-1 is modelled by starting at a geolocated origin 
point and visiting science locations. The locations are uniformly distributed within a 
square grid 40 km on a side (the maximum radius of a DRM-1 is 20 km), and on average 
the science locations are roughly 3 km apart. Each has a coordinate relative to the origin 
point, and when coupled with the known latitude and longitude of the origin, one can 
determine the lat/lon coordinate of the location of interest. 

Using this grid, we manually generated 24 excursion plans, where the vehicle would start 
at the origin point in the middle of the grid and travel to a pre-defined sequence of 
locations. These 24 excursions are of four types, as shown in Figure 43, which capture a 
broad range of exploration strategies: 
•	 Spiral: a local survey of the immediate surroundings, where the astronauts 
investigate sites around to the origin point and progressively move further away. 
•	 Loop: the astronauts visit sites in a roughly straight line away from the origin 
point, and return on a different straight line. 
•	 Area Search: a survey of a more distant area, where the astronauts travel to a site 
further away from the base (10 to 15 km) and investigates sites close by before 
returning to the origin point. 
•	 Grid Search: a sequence of straight-line traverses to explore a section of the 
surrounding area.

Figure 43: Search Patterns 

Each location of interest on a DRM-1 excursion can be one of two types: a “site”, which 
represents a single point of interest, and a “region”, which contains a collection of four 
sites close together. In the MUSE model, astronauts would spend between 30 to 45 
minutes at a site, and between 2 and 3 hours at a region (or four times the duration of a 
single site). 

A DRM-2 excursion consists of the camper starting at the outpost and travelling 100 km 
to a campsite, where the camper is parked. The campsite becomes the new origin point 
and the DRM-1 excursions are performed starting from camp. 

5.2.2 Statistical Sampling 
In scenario-based modeling, the results are highly dependent on the assumptions and 
properties of the scenarios that were run, such as the terrain over which it is performed 
and the site distribution used. The objective becomes to abstract out as much of the 
dependence on site selection and terrain as possible. 

For the purposes of this project, which introduces MUSE as a proof of concept, only a 
small number of sample points were collected. These points provided variation in the 
scenarios conducted by changing the following parameters: 

1.	 Exploration strategies (the 24 excursions mentioned in the previous section) 
2.	 Science site types (“site” vs. “region”) 
3.	 Operations within a region (walking vs. driving between sites) 
4.	 Origin locations (five for DRM-1) 

5.  Habitat and camp locations (ten for DRM-2) 

There were 360 total sample points for DRM-1 operations, and 10 for DRM-2 operations. 
Missions were assigned for both DRM-1 and DRM-2 operations. For each DRM-1 
mission, all 24 excursions were run. 

A DRM-1 mission consists of: 
1.  Choosing whether the science site is a single site or a region. 
2.  If the science site is a region, whether the astronauts walk or drive between sites 
3.  The location of the origin. 

A DRM-2 mission consists of the habitat and camp locations between which the campers 
and UPVs travel. 

The eventual goal is to create a surface mobility operations equivalent of an aircraft V-n 
diagram to provide an indication of the envelope of capabilities of the mobility system 
across a number of logistical scenarios. However, to create such a diagram, a 
significantly larger sampling would be required. 

Terrain Map 
The terrain elevation data used was a Digital Elevation Map (DEM) of a highland area 
west of Tsiolkovsky Crater on the far side of the moon (110E-117E, 16S-23S) as shown 
in Figure 44. The data was generated using imagery taken by stereo cameras mounted on 
the Service Module of Apollo 15. This area was selected because it had one of the most 
accurate elevation data sets. In this DEM, one pixel represented a square approximately 
210 m on a side, and the elevation resolution was 39 m. This compares to most lunar 
DEM data that has 1 km pixel resolution and 75 m elevation resolution. 

Figure 44: Highland west of Tsiolkovsky Crater 

Coupled with the terrain data is an estimation of two factors. First, the meander factor 
(MF) is a factor that determines how much distance is actually travelled compared to the 
actual distance between two points. This was estimated by evaluating the average change 
between a pixel and its surrounding pixels. Second, the speed factor (SF) is the fraction 
of the maximum speed allowed. It is modelled as an inverse square relation to the 
2
meander factor: SF = 1 / MF . This relation was based on experience from the Maine-
Moon-Mars analogue excursion. 

5.2.3 Propulsion Model 
While on a traverse, MUSE determines the instantaneous power consumption required to 
propel the vehicles over the terrain. A propulsion function was created by modifying 
several modules from the existing PSV software. The function calculates the drive power 
required based on the speed at which the vehicle drives, the grade in the direction of 
travel, loaded vehicle mass, vehicle parameters (wheel diameter, number of wheels), and 
the environment parameters (soil properties, gravity). Table 25 shows the output of the 
model based on the selected inputs:

5.2.4 Constraints and Drive-Back 
MUSE is designed to guarantee that vehicles always return to the origin point, which is 
either the camper or base for DRM-1, or the base for DRM-2. This is enforced by drive-
back constraints on the total EVA time and energy storage onboard the vehicles, although 
life support consumables could be included in the future. 

A constraint is considered violated if there would not be enough time, energy, or other 
consumables remaining to drive to the next site, explore, and return to the origin. If a 
constraint is violated, then MUSE “drives” the vehicle back to base. The vehicle can 
either take the straight-line path back to base, which assumes worst-case terrain 
properties (since terrain on this path is unknown), or it can drive back over the path it 
took (with known properties). The drive-back decision chooses the path that takes the 
least amount of time, and increments the time and decrements the consumables 
accordingly. 

5.2.5 DRM-1 Modelling 
A DRM-1 consists of starting at the origin point and travelling to a pre-defined set of 
science sites as described in the Exploration Strategy section. Between each site, MUSE 
calculates intermediate points, or “chops”, spaced every 200 m. At each of these chops, 
the travel distance, speed, average slope are accessed from the map data, and the time to 
traverse the chop is computed by dividing travel distance by speed. Based on the data of 
the chop, the required propulsion power and the total energy consumed (power draw × 
time) are computed. This energy is decremented from the onboard fuel supply, and the 
total time on EVA is incremented. This continues until the vehicle reaches the site. 

At each site, the vehicle does not consume power, but EVA time elapses and samples are 
collected at a constant rate of 18 kg/hr, which is based on Apollo sample collection [R]. 
The time spent at a site is a uniform random variable between 0.5 to 0.75 h. When the site 
time expires, MUSE checks the constraints to determine if the vehicle can reach the next 

site and have enough energy and time to return. If so, the vehicle starts another traverse to 
travel to the next site, and if not, the vehicle drives back. 

5.2.5 DRM-2 Modelling 
A DRM-2 excursion consists of two parts: the traverse from the hab to the campsite and 
exploration of the campsite. During the traverse to the campsite, the code keeps track of 
three main quantities for the five vehicles (3 UPVs and 2 campers): 

1.	 Camper energy supply 
Both the campers and the UPVs that tow them draw power from the energy 
supplies onboard the camper during the excursion. As the vehicles move along the 
terrain, MUSE calculates the required power and decrements the camper energy 
storage accordingly. 

2.	 Lead UPV energy supply 
One of the three UPVs travels ahead to scout the terrain and is not connected to 
the camper power supply. When the energy stores on the lead UPV are exhausted, 
all vehicles stop and the UPV is refuelled by the camper. 

3.	 EVA time 
When the total time of travel reaches 7 hours, all vehicles stop and the astronauts 
rest for 17 hours. During this time, the camper draws power from onboard 
supplies but the UPVs are turned off. 

Once the UPVs and campers have reached the campsite, the campsite represents the new 
origination point, and DRM-1s are conducted. The modelling of the DRM-1s at the 
campsite is the same as described in the previous section. 

5.3 Integration with Vehicle Design 
MUSE provides the ability to evaluate a point design from the vehicle model on 
representative lunar terrain. MUSE takes as inputs the mass and energy capacities of each 
vehicle and simulates exploration operations in terms of the amount of energy required to 
traverse the terrain between science sites. The results show how capable the vehicles are 
to perform DRM-1 and DRM-2 operations in terms of onboard consumables. Ideally, an 
iteration would occur where the vehicle design team would analyze the results from 
MUSE and adjust the vehicle design to improve performance. One such iteration was 
conducted over the course of this project and is described below. 

5.3.1 Design Iteration Case Study 
Our team was able to perform two design iterations with the vehicle model and MUSE; 
that is, the outputs of the vehicle model were fed into MUSE, after which the teams 
convened and discussed how the design should be improved for the next run. 

After the first iteration, MUSE output data provided two observations. First, the energy 
capacity onboard the UPV for use on DRM-1 was far too high: over all the runs 
performed, the fuel used never exceeded 25% of capacity, meaning the UPV was 

carrying too much fuel. Second, the camper had insufficient energy to reach the camp: by 
the time it reached the site at which DRM-1s were to be performed, there was not enough 
remaining fuel to make it back to base, let alone stay at the camp to explore. 

This provided valuable data to the vehicle design team that prompted them to modify 
their code. For example, some power-consuming units were removed and the power 
consumption profile was re-evaluated to be more realistic. As well, they made some 
modifications to the vehicle designs: the energy capacity was increased on the camper 
and decreased on the UPV. Another run of the vehicle model was performed, and these 
modified designs were input into MUSE for the final analysis. 

5.4 Current Limitations of MUSE 
The conclusions to be discussed in the following sections are based on the results of the 
model, which currently uses various internal assumptions to calculate the capability of 
the vehicle design. The results should be interpreted with these limitations in mind. 

5.4.1 Surface Location 
The map data used was of Tsiolkovsky crater, which is on the far side of the Moon. The 
data set was selected due to the difficulty of obtaining other, high-resolution maps. It is 
unlikely that this location will be visited on a lunar mission, so the vehicle is being 
assessed in MUSE on terrain that does not necessarily reflect the terrain on which will 
actually perform. Although using actual lunar data increases the fidelity of the analysis 
(rather than simple average quantities), future iterations should use map data of sites 
where lunar missions will be performed. 

5.4.2 Map Resolution and Slopes 

The elevation in the lunar maps used in MUSE is known at points spaced roughly 200 m 
apart. When the slope is calculated between two points, it determines the average grade 
between two points, and this is fed into the propulsion module. Although this may 
represent the overall average change in elevation from one point to the next, this 
approach cannot capture smaller hills as shown in Figure 45. This could significantly 
change the actual propulsion power requirements.

and MUSE internal representation (right) 

5.4.3 Propulsion Modeling 
The propulsion model, as adapted from PSV, currently assumes a constant speed on a 
constant slope for each 200 m traverse chop. Braking and acceleration due to more fine 
undulations in the terrain are accounted for by a simple factor of 2 on the drive power. A 
higher fidelity model of these two processes should be implemented in the future. 

5.5 Sample Analysis Outputs 
This section provides an overview of the results of the MUSE simulation of the planetary 
surface mobility system. 

5.5.1 DRM-1 Energy / Payload Capacity Performance 
Three consumables were tracked during the simulation of the DRM-1 missions: energy, 
sample payload mass, and sample payload volume. 

Figure 46 is the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the energy capacity 
remaining on each UPV once the vehicle has returned to base. The distribution is 
calculated using all 360 DRM-1 excursions that were sampled. The CDF shows that each 
UPV consumes at least 30% of the available energy capacity on an excursion. Also, if the 
safety margin on the energy consumption were 15%, there is a 6% chance that the UPV 
would consume some of the safety margin by the time it returns to base. 

Figure 46: CDF of Remaining Energy on UPV for DRM-1 

Figure 47 shows the CDFs for the payload mass and volume capacities remaining on each 
UPV once the vehicle has returned to base. There is a 30% chance that the UPVs will use 
up the sample mass capacity, but there is always at least 77% of the sample volume 
capacity remaining. These results suggest that the UPV design should be modified to 
increase the payload mass allowance and to consider decreasing the payload volume 
capacity, since it is never used up. 

The two CDFs have the same shape due to the relationship between the sample mass and 
volume collection rates. The mass rates were estimated from the Apollo missions and the 
volume collection rates were found using the mass rate estimate and the average bulk 
density of the moon. Since the underlying variables are related, the shapes of the CDFs 
are also related. 

Figure 47: (a) Payload mass capacity CDF, (b) Payload volume capacity CDF 

5.5.2 DRM-1 Drive-Back Conditions 
Over all DRM-1 excursions, approximately 70% of the excursions ended because the 
vehicles were running out of energy, rather than exploration time (which constituted the 
remaining 30% of the excursions). This implies the operational envelope of the vehicles 
is most constrained by energy. 

Also, at the end of almost every excursion (98%), the vehicle drove back to base on a 
straight-line path rather than over the path already traversed. This could be due to the 
exploration patterns, as vehicles may perform very winding paths to visit many sites, so 
the total distance traveled is much longer than the eventual straight-line path to base at 
the end of the excursion. 

5.5.3 DRM-1 Metric and Results 
The DRM-1 excursions were evaluated to determine vehicle performance in terms of the 
number of science sites that could be explored, since this metric directly relates to the 
overall value-generating process of exploration. The vehicles were also designed 
assuming a certain range (distance to furthest site and back plus some margin for 
meandering). This section details the results in terms of the number of sites visited per 
excursion and the effective operational range of the vehicle. 

Figure 48 shows the Probability Density Function (PDF) for the number of sites visited 
per excursion over all the sampled missions. There appears to be a bimodal distribution: 
one hump occurs at about 4-5 sites visited per excursion, and the other occurs over 9 sites 
per excursion. This is due to the two types of science locations that the UPVs visit: single 
sites and regions. The vehicle can visit more sites if the locations are regions because the 
vehicle has to travel shorter distances to reach clusters of sites, so the peak on the right of 
Figure 48 represents visiting regions, where the left peak is visiting single sites. 

Figure 48: PDF of number of science sites visited per DRM-1 

The overall expected value is 5.71 sites visited per DRM-1, with a standard deviation of 
3.02. The large standard deviation is an artifact of the bimodal distribution. 

5.5.4 DRM-1 Range 
A histogram of the achieved range, or total distance traveled, for DRM-1 activities over 
all missions and excursions are shown in Figure 49. As before, the distribution is 
bimodal, though it is not nearly so distinct as for the number of sites visited. The UPVs 
were designed assuming an operational range of 60 km, but the results show the average 
distance traveled on a DRM-1 is only about 30 km. 

Figure 49: Histogram of DRM-1 range 

5.5.5 DRM-2 Energy Storage 
The DRM-2 missions are evaluated in terms of their capability to enable DRM-1 
exploration activities, which is the primary value-generating capability of the camper 
vehicles. This is determined by the amount of energy available for exploration onboard 
the campers when they reach the campsite. 

Figure 50 shows the energy available to perform DRM-1 varies dramatically for each 
8
DRM-2 mission analyzed. The worst-case DRM-1 energy available is only 2x10 J, and 
8
the best-case energy available is over 8x10 J, or 4 times as much as the minimum. This 

result is due to the variation in terrain that the vehicles must traverse in order to travel to 
the campsite. 

Figure 50: Energy available on camper for DRM-1 exploration 

5.5.6 DRM-2 Metric and Results 
The metric used to determine the performance of the campers on DRM-2 is the number 
of DRM-1s that can be performed when at the campsite. To calculate this, the UPV 
energy PDFs from DRM-1 were combined with the energy remaining data to determine 
the number of DRM-1s that are possible given the energy capacity of the campers. 

The results shown in Figure 51 show that there is a 40% chance not being able to perform 
any DRM-1s, which means the vehicles must turn back immediately after reaching the 
campsite without exploring. There is a 40% chance of performing one DRM-1, and a 
20% chance of performing two DRM-1s (with the small possibility of a third). 

This distribution suggests an expectation of 0.8 DRM-1s per DRM-2, with a standard 
deviation of 0.75. The vehicle architecture was designed to be able to perform 3 DRM-1 
exploration activities per DRM-2, so the results have several possible explanations. First, 
the camper vehicle may be under-designed. Second, one of the current limitations in 
MUSE is creating an over-constrained energy profile. We would suggest that the next 
iteration of the camper design contain more energy onboard, as well as additional work 
on MUSE to resolve some of the aforementioned limitations. 

Figure 51: PDFs of the possible number of DRM-1s per DRM-2 

5.6 Modularity Opportunities 
One of the goals of this project was to identify opportunities to introduce modularity into 
the design. This section details a few of these opportunities highlighted by MUSE. 

5.6.1 Modularity of Vehicle Energy Supply 
One opportunity highlighted by MUSE is to consider the possibility of storing the energy 
consumables for the vehicles in modular, easily swappable containers. Creating modular 
energy supplies is a benefit in two respects. 

Figure 52: UPV energy use and possible modularization strategy 

First, it would be possible to better match the energy requirements of the DRM-1 
excursions to the energy capacity stored onboard. The variation in the energy usage over 
the different excursions and missions is considerable. Figure 52 shows the possible 
breakdown of energy storage according to the energy consumption curves of all 
excursions analyzed in MUSE. Carrying less energy translates to less mass which would 
make the UPVs more fuel-efficient, or the astronauts could use the extra space to store 
more samples. 

Second, it is an area of potential commonality among vehicles. Modular energy storage 
could be very useful on the long DRM-2 missions, during which it was found that the 
lead UPV would need to be refueled at least twice on the way out to camp and twice 
again on the way back. Modular energy storage could enable astronauts to easily swap 
used energy storage modules for full ones to quickly resupply the UPVs. 

5.6.2 Modularity of ECLSS Supplies 
Modularity opportunities also exist for the ECLSS supplies, although the current version 
of MUSE does not track these consumables. Modular ECLSS supplies could potentially 
extend the excursion capabilities in some instances. For example, the missions that 
violated the time constraint did so because the time constraint was a simple way of 
capturing the availability of the ECLSS consumables. Additionally, modularity in the 
ECLSS supplies would enable easy reallocation of supplies as necessary, for nominal 
operations as well as in contingency situations.

limitations discussed previously. 

5.8 Future Work and Extensibility 

MUSE was constructed to be as extensible as possible. Here are a few ways that MUSE 
can be extended in the future: 

3.  Extend the analytical framework to include Mars and Earth. 
4.  Incorporate more logistics, as well as communications and navigation 
5.  Incorporate terrain data for the entire planetary surface to improve sampling. 
6.  Extend to include ECLSS consumables (the structure is already in the code). 

As well, future work should strive to resolve some of the limitations of MUSE as 
described in previous sections.

6. Commonality with Earth and Mars Mobility Systems 

6.1 Commonality, sensitivity, extensibility for different environments 
The commonality and extensibility of the camper and UPV was analyzed using 
the PSV model developed prior to this project. The PSV model was used because of the 
general assumptions it made about Earth and Mars terrain. Terrain profiles and soil 
characteristics are needed in the TVM propulsion module. However, these inputs were 
not sufficiently available for the TVM to produce Earth and Mars point designs. As a 
result, the PSV model was used to provide specific point designs for the Moon, Earth, 
and Mars. Although the PSV is not as detailed as the TVM, it does provide an overview 
of the scaling affects the environment will have on the mass of the subsystem. (The 
differences between the PSV and TVM models were explained in the vehicle design 
sections.) It is important to note that multipliers and percentage of mass changes need to 
be analyzed to gain insight into vehicle commonality and extensibility. Looking at the 
multiplier or subsystem mass separately does not provide the complete picture of the 
design’s extensibility. 

Variables 
The table below provides a list of the subsystems that will be affected the most by 
changes in planet environment. The environment will have varying affects on each of the 
subsystem. For example, the chassis subsystem will be scaled mainly by the gravity on 
the planet while the power unit will change depending on the temperature difference 
between the system and outside environment. Although the table lists the major 
subsystems that are correlated with the environment, not all of them, for example the 
radiation subsystem, were modeled by PSV.

On Earth, the subsystems that vary the most from the Moon design are the crew 
station, chassis, and propulsion. The Earth crew station will be significantly lighter than 
the Moon design because the Earth camper will not need an airlock. The Earth gravity 
effects will greatly increase the chassis mass and the Earth terrain and soil parameters 
will affect the drive system, wheel sizing, and suspension. 
The Mars design differs from the Moon design primarily in terms of chassis 
structure, propulsion, and power design. These subsystems will be affected by Mars’ 
gravity, terrain characteristics, and temperature ranges. 
In most of these subsystems, the bounding design will be for Mars. Mars almost 
always incur the most massive design, except for the Earth chassis and drive system. 
However, the vehicle masses for the different environments do not vary significantly. The 
Mars camper is 1.186 times more massive than the Moon design. On the other hand, the 
Earth camper is only 0.926 times the mass of the Moon design.

On Earth, the subsystems that contributed the most variation from the Moon 
design are the chassis, propulsion, power and thermal. The Earth gravity will greatly 
increase the chassis mass and the Earth terrain and soil parameters will affect the drive 
system, wheel sizing and suspension. The temperature differences will also lead to 
varying power and thermal subsystem masses. 
The Mars design differs from the Moon design in terms of chassis structure, 
propulsion, and power design. These subsystems will be affected by Mars’ gravity, 
terrain characteristics and temperature ranges. 
In most of these subsystems, the bounding design will be for Earth. The Mars and 
Moon UPV designs are similar in many aspects. The major difference between these two 
designs is the mass of the wheels. The wheel mass for Mars is approximately 5.6 times 
that of the Moon UPV. Nevertheless, the Earth design is much more massive then either 
one of the other designs. The Earth UPV is 3.6 and 1.875 times as massive as the Moon 
and Mars design, respectively. The variation in chassis mass is a significant contribution 
of the total mass differences. This limits the feasibility of designing a common system for 
all three planet conditions. Designing the UPV for the Moon and Mars, while 
customizing existing ATVs for Earth operations, is recommended. 

Subsystem overview 
One has to look at both the mass multiplier and percentage of the total system 
mass incurred by the subsystem to understand how much of an affect the subsystem 
design has on the overall vehicle. For example, the guidance system on Mars can be three 
times more massive then the guidance system on Earth. However, the mass of the 
guidance system does not contribute significantly to the mass over the overall system. As 
a result, the guidance system would not be considered a major consideration for 
commonality between the different designs. The figure below highlights the subsystems 
that will have a large impact on the level of commonality that can be achieved between 
the different operating environments. This is based on the commonality results from PSV 
and an understanding of how the subsystem operates. The baseline design will be for the 
Moon. The blue boxes highlight the systems that will vary from the baseline design only 
on Earth. The yellow boxes highlight the systems that will vary from the baseline design 
only on Mars. The green boxes highlight the systems that will different significantly in 
both environments. 

Figure 53: Subsystem changes, graphical overview 

The following diagram is a pictorial presentation of these subsystems. This diagram does 
not show all of the subsystems that will vary because of display limitations. The colors 
correspond to the key provided in the figure above. 

Figure 54: Subsystem changes, drawing 

Two design options 
There are two design options that can be taken when designing for the camper and 
the UPV: fix the chassis frame for all environments or design customized chasses. The 
chassis subsystem was chosen because it acts as the connecting station for many of the 
other subsystems. As a result, the geometry of the chassis will greatly impact how the 

other subsystems are designed and interface with each other. The universal chassis frame 
can help with modularization. However, there is a mass overhead will incur when 
operating the vehicle in an environment it was not optimized for. On the other hand, 
customized chasses for different environments will result in more locally optimized 
designs but will require a large amount of development cost. 

Conclusion 
The fix chassis geometry is recommended for several reasons. A common chassis 
designed for different environments will reduce multiple chassis design costs. This will 
also increase the number of common components between the different vehicle designs. 
A universal chassis design will also reduce the supply chain complexities and logistics 
with manufacturing and upkeeping these vehicles. Furthermore, this will make subsystem 
modules interchangeable for different missions and environments. For example, a 
pressurized water tank can be easily interfaced with both the campers on Earth and the 
Moon. In addition, the chassis beam profiles can vary to account for different loads. This 
will reduce excess mass while maintaining the geometry of the chassis. Nevertheless, the 
crew station and propulsion systems (especially the wheel dimensions) still need to be 
significantly modified based on terrain and the external environment. 
Furthermore, the UPV is recommended to be designed for operations on the 
Moon and Mars. Designing a UPV for all three environments will result in a vehicle with 
an extremely large overhead that will be difficult to transport to the Moon and Mars. It is 
recommended that existing ATVs can be customized for Earth operations. Furthermore, 
over designing the UPV chassis can be beneficial to DRM 3 and DRM 4 operations on 
the Moon. 

6.2 DRM 3 and DRM 4 Revisited 
The team had time at the end of the semester to briefly revisit the possibility of 
using the UPV for DRM 3 and DRM 4 operations. There was enough time to perform a 
structural analysis of the chassis. The maximum horizontal forces and vertical loads at the 
end of the chassis are determined to be enough for limited DRM 3 and DRM 4 
operations. 
The initial purpose of DRM 3 and DRM 4 was for resupply and infrastructure 
buildup at the base. Resupply in DRM 3 consisted of moving cargo from the lander to the 
base within three km. This can involve some form of lifting mechanisms or towing 
capacities. DRM 4 includes the infrastructure buildup within three km of the base. 
Operation possibilities include moving regolith, deploying small equipments around the 
base, light surface construction, and connecting base modules with wires, etc. 
The results from TVM show that the chassis structure is capable of withstanding a 
6
horizontal force of approximately 6x10 N and a vertical point force at the front of the 
3
chassis of approximately 2,296 N. An average regolith density of 1,250 kg/m and the 
bucket capacity of SOLAR 010 and 015 Plus vehicles (the table below shows the 
specifications for SOLAR Mini Excavators) are used to determine a bucket capacity of 
3
0.04 m and a lifting capacity of approximately 1,408 kg on the moon. A plowing force 
6
of 6x10 N can also be applied horizontally to the chassis before the maximum allowable 
deflection is reached. For these operations, interfaces must be designed into the chassis 

that allow for attachment arms, blades, etc. Future work will be to determine the stress 
concentrations around these interfaces for different type of appendages.

Although the chassis structure allows for resupply and infrastructure buildup, the 
extent of such operations will be largely constraint by the propulsion subsystem. The 
power need by the propulsion subsystem for DRM 3 and DRM 4 operations will impact 
the volume, mass and energy consumption of the system. Future works will be to analyze 
the propulsion capabilities of the UPV for resupply and infrastructure buildup.

7. Summary and Conclusions 

7.1 Discussion 
The value delivering activities on the surface were captured in the four types of design 
reference missions (DRM). These missions are representative of major exploration 
surface activities. DRM 1 incorporates science explorations within a 20 km radius of the 
base. DRM 1 will be performed on one EVA and have a total range of 60 km. DRM 2s 
are long traverses totaling up to 100 km on the Moon and 200 km for Mars and Earth. 
The duration for a DRM 2 ranges between 5 and 10 days. The total range of travel is 
expected to be 300 to 600 km. DRM 3 is the resupply of the base with cargo located up to 
2 km away. Finally, DRM 4 is the build and maintenance of infrastructure at the base or 
outpost. 

In addition, this project independently confirmed the superiority of the camper 
architecture. The camper architecture eliminates the duplicate functionality of a 
pressurized rover and unpressurized rover system. The selected architect also enhances 
the flexibility of the total system in terms of functional options. 

Furthermore, a Terrain Vehicle Model (TVM) was created that included a set of 
subsystem models with more resolution compared to the PSV. The TVM relied mostly on 
physics-based and engineering-based models. The individual subsystems are much more 
defined in terms of inputs, outputs, and interfaces. Furthermore, TVM includes modules 
that were not considered by PSV, such as the radiation subsystem. More options and 
design variables were built into the TVM. For example, there is a wider range of 
structural materials available for selection. 

The team also created a versatile integrated capability modeling framework for surface 
operations based on vehicle designs. The Mission Utility Simulation Environment 
(MUSE) serves as a validation tool of the vehicle capabilities. MUSE allows for iterative 
designs by incorporating the actual terrain data and vehicle design with what the 
astronauts will actually be doing on the Moon.  MUSE also identifies power modularity 
opportunities and can be extended to monitoring other consumables. 

Design specifications were generated for an extensible planetary surface mobility system. 
The design passed through the vehicle design iteration once and twice in MUSE. Specific 
dimensions and power usages of the different subsystems are provided for both the 
camper and the UPV. The dedicated UPV and camper were design with a common core 
and extensible modules for Earth/Moon/Mars environment customizations. In addition, 
computer aided drawings were produced of the UPV and the camper.

Appendix to Section 3.3, Architecture Analysis 

DRM-1 Mass analysis 
In order to perform the architecture analysis, the PSV code originally written by Afreen 
Siddiqi and updated by Seungbum Hong was implemented. The Matlab scripts for this 
code are available elsewhere in the appendix. The section that follows is simply meant to 
explain what inputs were chosen for the code, and how the outputs were determined. 
Figure 55: PSV GUI is the GUI (Guided User Interface) for running the PSV code.

The lunar sortie soil data was input as displayed above in the GUI figure. The values 
were obtained from a variety of sources, as outlined elsewhere in this design document. 
The Mars data is seen below, in Figure 56: Mars Data in PSV GUI: 

Figure 56: Mars Data in PSV GUI 

Once the each of the inputs was run, the data was output to an Excel spreadsheet. 

The PSV outputs a number of values, including the wheel width and wheel diameter, both 
of which will be used for the DRM-2 analysis. However, the critical outputs of the PSV 
code for the purposes of the DRM-1 architecture analysis are the total vehicle mass and 
the power mass. 

In order to determine the total system mobility wet mass, a series of assumptions were 
made regarding a variety of parameters. Those values are listed in Table 31: DRM-1 
constants below:

Given this information, the mass of the additional cart carried by any astronauts who are 
walking can be determined: 

where, 

mcart  = 

50 × t 
sci 
2 
mcart  = mass of cart, kg 
tsci  = science time of walking astronauts, hr 

(1) 

The mass becomes heavier with the more science time, because it must be redesigned to 
carry the additional samples. However, to conduct this analysis first the science time of 
the walking astronauts must be calculated, using the following formula: 
r 
t sci  = ncrew  × (t EVA  −  walk  ) 
v walk 
ncrew = number of crew walking 
tEVA  = time on EVA (total suit time), hr 
rwalk= walking range, km 
vwalk  = walking speed, km/hr 

where,	

(2) 

Now the total system mobility wet mass can be solved for: 

where,	

m sys  = nveh  × mveh  + mcart  + n days  × m pow  × 1.5	
msys  = total system mobility wet mass, kg 
nveh  = number of vehicles 
ndays  = number of days of exploration 
mpow = power mass, kg 

(3) 

The 1.5 represents the additional structure to be towed by the vehicle to hold the fuel. 
Now that the mass has been determined, the cumulative number of sites must be 
calculated. 

DRM-1 number of sites 
First, the number of science sites visited by the astronauts walking is computed, as seen 
in the following formula: 

where,	

t 
n sites ,w  =  sci 
t site 
nsites,w  = number of sites visited walking 
tsite  = time per site, crew-hr 

(4) 

To determine the number of sites visited by the crew driving, the same equation is used. 
Here, however, tsci  is computed differently than before: 

t sci ,d  = ncrew  × (t EVA  − t load  − t unload  − t drive )	

(5) 

where,	

tload = time taken to load the vehicle, hr 
tunload = time taken to unload the vehicle, hr 
tdrive  = driving time, hr 

However, the three quantities outlined above (tload, tunload, tdrive) need to be found before 
this equation can be used. The loading and unloading times are found via a simple 
calculation, defined by: 

t 
load 

= 

× n 
tc 
load 
veh 
n crew 

(6) 

where, 

tcload= total crew hour time to load a vehicle, crew-hours 

Since, tcload = tcunload, the calculation for tunload  is exactly the same as equation 6. 

The equation used to determine tdrive  is quite simple as well: 
r 
t drive  =  veh 
v veh 
rveh  = range of the vehicle 
vveh  = speed of the vehicle 

where,	

(7) 

For the initial analysis, the limiting factor is always the time spent driving, as it is 
assumed that the entire range is covered on every traverse. 

The cumulative number of sites visited is: 

n sites , to t  = n days  × (n sites ,w  + n sites ,d  )	

(8) 

where,	

nsites,tot  = total number of sites visited 
nsites,d  = number of sites visited driving 

With each architecture and each independent variable considered, the total trade space 
can then be displayed and analyzed. The first figure presented is that of the Lunar DRM-1 
entire trade space. 

Figure 57: Lunar DRM-1 Trade Space 

The significantly heavier designs are those powered by radio-isotopes. The other 3 
groups are solar power, fuel cells, and batteries. The solar panels were the lightest design, 
but the necessary surface area was prohibitively large. Additionally, there was significant 
concern about their ability to operate in craters or during the lunar night. Therefore, fuel 

cells were chosen as the ideal option. For further analysis see Section 3.3, where this 
issue is discussed in greater depth. Following the Lunar trade space is that of the Mars 
DRM-1 trade space. 

Figure 58: Mars DRM-1 trade space 

The same variations between radio-isotopes, solar cells, fuel cells and batteries hold here 
as for the lunar DRM-1 analysis. This graph does not much in the way of detailed 
comparisons between the other architecture options. That information is much easier 
gleaned from the following figure, the Mars DRM-1 Pareto front. 

Additionally, from the trade spaces it was found that given the mass requirements for a 
mission to either Moon or Mars, that all crew members could be mobilized. This situation 
could be critical if a landing vehicle failed to touch down near the habitation module, so 
that the crew had to travel greater than a nominal walking distance. 

Figure 59: Mars DRM-1 Pareto Front 

DRM-2 Mass analysis 
For the DRM-2 analysis, both the mass of the open unpressurized vehicles and the 
pressurized vehicles (either pressurized rovers or campers) must be computed. First, the 
method for determining the total system mobility wet mass if the pressurized rover will 
be explained. 

Pressurized Rover 
The initial steps taken are the same as those listed above for the DRM-1 mass estimates, 
with two exceptions, the first being the speed is held constant at 20 km/hr and the second 
being that the calculation of total mass is not computed (Equation

This step will not be completed until the pressurized rover mass has been found. Once

Once again, the critical outputs are the total vehicle mass and the power mass. The total 
mobility system wet mass (for the pressurized rover case) is then computed by the 
following equation: 

where,	

mtot  = nveh , p  × (mtow  + mveh , p ) + nveh ,u  × mveh ,u	
mtot= total system mobility wet mass, kg 
nveh,p = number of pressurized rovers 
mtow= towed mass, kg

nveh,u = number of unpressurized vehicles 
mveh,u = mass of unpressurized vehicles, kg

The towed mass does not include the vehicle itself, as that is assumed to be able to drive

The ratio of the ranges sizes the additional power mass needed to drive the unpressurized 
vehicle autonomously over the long-distance traverse. The additional power masses can 
be specified by stating that an additional power mass is required for every day of 
exploration, and a factor of 1.5 was used for the additional structure needed to house this 
additional mass for towing purposes. The one accounts for the fact that one of the total 
power masses is already included in the vehicle design. 

Camper

The analysis process for the camper uses many of the same steps as the pressurized rover.

The differences will be outlined in this section.


For the camper, the initial code run is for the camper, not the unpressurized vehicles. The 
inputs are as specified below, with the only changes being the PSV type, the towed mass, 
the towed wheel width, and the towed wheel diameter, as the last 3 variables are set to 0 
kg, 0 m, and 0m respectively.

Previously, this value was held at 20 degrees, but with the extra 
towed mass this number is unreasonable. The upv alone should 
be able to handle 20 degree slope without the additional mass 
quite easily. 

Therefore, the total system mass is defined as: 
mtot  = nveh , p  × mveh , p  + nveh ,u  × mveh ,u  + m add 
madd  = additional power mass, kg 

where, 

(11) 

Since the upvs are only designed to transport the camper 60 km, there must be additional 
mass made to tow the vehicle over the rest of the long-distance traverse, as well as on the 
short explorations. The additional power mass is defined as: 


The upv exploration power mass is sized by taking ¼ of the dry mass, which was the 
average of the ratio found between power mass and dry mass through a variety of trials. 
With no camper to tow, the power mass should decrease significantly. The 2 is in the 
equation because only 2 upvs are taken on an exploration traverse. The third is always 
left behind with the camper, since there is no need to waste the additional fuel. 

DRM-2 Cumulative number of sites visited 
This calculation is the same for both the pressurized rover and camper architectures. The 
first step is to calculate the number of sites visited on one day, as seen in Equations 4-8, 
with ndays  equal to 1. 

The total number of sites visited over a cumulative time period (60 days for the Moon, 
200 days for Mars) is defined as: 
t exp 
n site ,tot  = (d sci  + n sites ,u  × d sci  )× 
t sortie 
nsites,tot = cumulative number of sites 
nsites,u = number of sites visited on exploration day 
texp  = cumulative time period for site exploration 
tsortie  = length of sortie duration 

where, 

(13) 

It was assumed that each waypoint along the exploration path is a science site as well, 
which accounts for the first inclusion of science days in Eq. 
t exp 
n site ,tot  = (d sci  + n sites ,u  × d sci  )× 
t sortie 

(13). 

The determination of the number of science days given a speed and sortie duration is 
defined as:

vveh,p = speed of pressurized vehicle, km/hr 
tdrive  = time spent driving, hr 

(14)


The time spent driving is assumed to be 8 hours a day for the purposes of this analysis. 
Anything more would require an additional EVA or enhanced suit design. Also, more 
time spent driving would be extremely tiring for the astronauts, as navigation over rough 
terrain is both physically and mentally challenging. 

With all the metrics now calculated, the trade space can be created, and the various 
options analyzed. 

DRM-2 Trade Spaces 
The following figures outline the entire trade space analyzed for each planetoid for the 
DRM-2 mission. The first figure presented is that of Lunar DRM-2 Trade space. 

After ruling out the other power systems, due to a very brief analysis and given the data 
of the DRM-1 analysis, these graphs simply represent the array of architectures. There 
are obviously some outliers in terms of efficiency. These are 1 pressurized vehicle 
architecture, and the reason for not selecting them (along with a more detailed Pareto 
Front figure) is in the body of this report. 

Figure 60 Lunar DRM-2 Trade Space 

The same level of analysis was undertaken for the Mars DRM-2. The following figure is 
the complete trade space. 

Figure 61 Mars DRM-2 Trade Space 

Similar to the Moon DRM-2 analysis, only fuel cells architectures are included. Here the 
most efficient outliers are the 6 person architectures, especially with only 2 or 3 vehicles. 
The following figure, the pareto front for the Mars DRM-2 architecture, provides a better 
visualization of this fact. 

Figure 62 Mars DRM-2 Trade Space Pareto Front 

In the graph, the 2 camper, 4 crew (2 crew each) is not the most efficient design. 
However, the better designs all use 6 crew members, and are not extensible. The cost to 
design one vehicle, as opposed to many vehicles optimized for each planetoid, is much 
less and justifies choosing a non-optimal solution for Mars.

Appendix to Section 3.4, Sensitivity Analysis 

This Appendix displays all the additional figures and comments on the sensitivity 
analysis. 

DRM-1 Sensitivity 
In addition to the speed study mentioned in the body, an analysis of the range was done 
as well, as seen in Figure 63: Lunar Range DRM-1 

Figure 63: Lunar Range DRM-1 

The max point for the efficiency in the case of the range values is 50 km, but this actually 
lends credence to the use of 60 km as the chosen range. The vehicle should be designed 
above some minimal constraints, so that after each EVA the astronauts are not returning 
merely on empty. With the vehicle able to travel a greater distance, it provides a 
reasonable margin of safety. Additionally, these numbers are based on certain 
assumptions (such as the 3 km range between sites) that would affect the overall numbers 
somewhat, but not the variation between each range option. Also, while the greater crew 
numbers may not be quite as efficient, the larger number of sites makes this a better 
option. This truth will become even more self-evident when connected with the DRM-2 
analysis. Without the vehicles, the number of sites visited will drop tremendously. 
Making a decision on a lunar sortie mission (DRM-1) without analyzing the effects on a 
longer stay mission would be short-sighted and hurt the ability to produce an extensible 
architecture. 

In most point designs, the limiting factor is the driving time. However, as the range 
decreases, the number of science sites becomes the main driver for the amount of science 
to be accomplished. A slight change was made to the architectural analysis procedure 
outlined elsewhere in the Appendix in order to account for this change. 

No Mars DRM-1 sensitivity analysis was undertaken because it would have been 
redundant. 

DRM-2 
The Lunar and Mars DRM-2 sortie days are seen in the body of the report. This section 
outlines the other two variables explored: range and speed. Figure 64: Lunar DRM-2 
Range displays the range data. 

Figure 64: Lunar DRM-2 Range 

This graph reveals one oddity of the analysis. Since the metric on the y-axis is based 
purely on the number of sites visited, rather than weighting sites by their distance from 
the base, the most number of sites are visited by the smallest range. This situation occurs 
because the driving time is minimized, leaving additional time for science. However, this 
may not be the most accurate analysis, but given the time and scope it was felt to be a 
reasonable approximation for metric analysis. It is important to notice that range is not a 
major mass driver; rather the vehicles are sized based on speed and duration, which will 
be seen in subsequent graphs, such as Figure 65: Lunar DRM-2 speed. 

In this graph, once again the 2 camper, 4 crew (2 crew per camper) is dominated by the 1 
vehicle architectures. However, as discussed previously elsewhere, the extra camper for 
exploration redundancy is worth the mass penalty. Additionally, the efficiency of the 
vehicle stops increasing around 12 km/hr, similar to the upv. However, more sites can be 
visited with the additional mass caused by the increase in speed. This trade-off should be 
made at the vehicle design level . 

Overall, the lunar sensitivity analysis shows no reason for a change in the baseline 
design. 

Figure 65: Lunar DRM-2 speed 

The Mars sensitivity analysis is the final step that must be undertaken to verify the 
architecture decision, at least at this level of fidelity. Figure 66 Mars DRM-2 Speed 
represents the speed analysis. 

Figure 66 Mars DRM-2 Speed 

In this graph, the baseline architecture is along the pareto front again. Like the lunar 
sensitivity analysis, there is not much increase in efficiency above 12 km/hr. As 
mentioned in the body of this report, the designs that allow for more sites to be visited all 
have all 6 crew on exploration. For reasons of extensibility, the baseline is kept to only 
hold 4 crew. This decision should also be remember when interpreting Figure 67 Mars 
DRM-2 Range. 

Figure 67 Mars DRM-2 Range 

As mentioned in the lunar DRM-2 analysis, this graph shows one of the weaknesses of 
the number of sites metric as calculated here. The baseline architecture here does not do 
as well as in the other sensitivity analyses, but given the overall strengths, and the lack of 
realistic operational assumptions built into this analysis, there is not enough data to 
overturn the baseline selection. 

In summary, the baseline selection was confirmed through the sensitivity analysis as 
described above. 

Appendix to Section 3.5, Communication and Navigation 

Communications Requirements 
The following discussion provides a brief overview of the primary and secondary 
requirements for the communications system for the planetary surface mobility system. 
The primary requirements are broken down by whether a function must happen (“hard” 
requirement), or should happen (“soft” requirement). 

Primary Hard Requirements 
•	 Must transport data from a mobile asset back to Earth at some point. This 
requirement ensures that scientific data, one of the primary value-delivering 
processes in the system, is retrieved. 
•	 Must have continuous communications between the base and mobile asset 
regardless of line-of-sight. This requirement is primarily for safety reasons, 
though the rationale varies depending on location: 
•	 Mars: The orbit and rotation of Mars, for example, makes continuous 
communications back to Earth difficult at best. It is assumed in the vehicle 
design study that there are always 2 astronauts at the base, so continuous 
communications between the base and the mobile asset must happen. 
•	 Moon: On the moon, it is assumed that the astronauts would either be at the 
base or on a sortie together. For landing sites on the near-side, the base should 
always have direct line-of-sight with Earth, though the mobile asset may not 
given the conditions of the local terrain. For landing sites on the far-side, 
neither the base nor the mobile asset will have direct line-of-sight with Earth, 
implying the need for at least a single space asset. Again, it is possible for the 
base to have direct line-of-sight with the space asset but not the mobile. 

Primary Soft Requirements 
6.	 Should transport data from mobile to Earth continuously. It is highly desirable for 
basic voice and telemetry communications and scientific data to be transported 
from the mobile asset to Earth continously “real-time”. However, due to orbital 
and terrain considerations, this is not always possible without significant 
infrastructure deployment. 
7.	 Should be extensible across missions. This requirement is intended to meet the 
extensibility goal of the project, though it should not drive the communications 
design. 
8.	 Should be cost-effective. Space-based communications systems are historically 
very expensive. Thus, it is greatly desirable to ensure that the amount of use the 
system sees per dollar spent on the system is as high as possible. 

There are also several high-level secondary requirements, or other aspects of the system 
that must be accounted for in the overall design. These requirements are self-explanatory. 

Secondary Requirements 
7.	 Communication transmissions should be secure. 
8.	 Tracking and navigation capabilities should not spectrally interfere with

communicating elements.

9.	 The communication infrastructure should support mission elements for the 
duration of the mission lifetime. 
10. Communicating elements should have the ability to survive and operate in 
abrasive, dusty environments with extreme radiation and thermal conditions. 
11. Should be flexible and evolvable to meet the growing and changing demands of 
missions over time. 

Navigation System Requirements 
The navigation system (also known as the Guidance, Navigation and Control – GN&C – 
system) is responsible for determining current and future position and direction and 
making the course corrections to get there. The GN&C system for the planetary surface 
mobility system has the following requirements: 

1.	 The planetary surface mobility system must be able to navigate from base to 
target(s) and back to base. 
2.	 The GN&C system must identify the current location of a mobile asset with 
sufficient location accuracy to meet the requirements of the interfacing systems. 
3.	 The GN&C system must predict the future location of a mobile asset assuming no 
course adjustments are made. 
4.	 The GN&C system should receive accurate real-time position, velocity,

acceleration, timing, and heading information.

5.	 The GN&C system must identify the location of desired future site(s) relative to 
the current location. 
6.	 The GN&C system must make course corrections to achieve desired future 
location(s). 

Navigation Architecture and Strategy 
For accuracy reasons, it was decided that the best architecture for the navigation system 
was one based on either a trilateration beacon network or a spaced-based network. Since 
the communication architecture incorporates a ground network of relays, the best 
architecture for the navigation system seems to be to piggyback a beacon network onto 
the communication infrastructure. 

For safety reasons, it was decided that each vehicle in the planetary surface mobility 
system must be able to navigate independently. Thus, each vehicle should be designed 
such that astronauts can manually navigate based on readings from internal gyroscopes 
and odometers. In case of failure in these systems, astronauts should also have maps. 

Navigation strategy: Hybrid: gyroscope + odometer, map, beacon network 

The performance of the navigation system in this design is dependent on the architecture 
for the communications system. No further analysis was conducted. 

Appendix to Section 4.4.1, Thermal Subsystem 
The thermal module takes a series of environmental inputs and vehicle heat production in 
order to size the subsystem. There are three types of environmental heat radiation: solar 
flux, albedo and infrared (IR) emission that will add heat to the system, so each flux must 
be quantified. The solar flux is the energy emitted from the sun, which varies inversely 
2
with the square of the distance from the sun. On average, the solar flux is 1360 W/m at 1 
AU in the direct path of the sun. However, when the camper and ups are shielded from 
2
the sun, this value becomes 0 W/m , as no sunlight reaches the vehicles. [Larson, 1999] 

The second is the albedo, which is the reflection of the solar flux off of the Moon’s 
surface. The average value for the albedo of the moon is an average of 0.12, which means 
that 12% of the solar flux is reflected back off the surface, and can add heat to the 
vehicle. [2] 

The third is the infrared (IR) emission from the heat of the Moon. This value can be 
found based on the simple equation: 

IR _ emit  = σT 4	

(15) 

where,	

2
-8 
σ = Stefan-Boltzmann constant, 5.67 x 10 W/m /K
T = surface temperature, K 
2
IR_emit = IR radiation, W/m

4

Assuming the temperature of the Moon to be 160 K [2], the level of IR radiation is then 
2
calculated to be approximately 37 W/m . Note that this temperature is a worst-case 
representation of the lunar polar region. The equator of the Moon becomes much hotter 
during the lunar noon, and would require a different thermal system to radiate heat. 
During the night, the temperatures drop to 120 K [2], so this value becomes much lower 
as well. 

Not all of this energy reaches the vehicles, as the outer coating of paint has some values 
of absorptivity and emissivity. For these calculations, the absorptivity was chosen as 0.2 
and the emissivity as 0.8. [Larson, 1999] The absorptivity factors the solar flux and 
albedo heat, while the emissivity factors the IR heat. These numbers cannot simply be 
added together however, as they do not all strike the vehicle in the same spot. The solar 
flux strikes mostly the top of the vehicle, and its sides, while the albedo and IR emission 
mostly encounter the bottom and sides. Given the design of the camper, an assumption 
was made that the structure was roughly 1/6 area on top and bottom, while the sides 
accounted for 2/3 of the surface area. 

2
2	
Directly overhead, the vehicle receives 272 W/m from the solar flux with up to 32 W/m
2
from albedo effects on the sides, and 32 W/m from IR emission on the sides and bottom. 
These numbers were averaged, described in the previous paragraph, so the vehicle 
2
2	
receives an average of 90 W/m during the lunar day and 8 W/m during the lunar night. 

This day value is then multiplied by the surface area of the vehicle (function input) to 
determine the environmental heat load. Added to this value is the heat produced by the 
vehicle (function input) to determine the total heat load. 

Some of this heat is lost passively due to the surface of the vehicle. To find the heat lost 
passively, the effective sink temperature must be defined: [Larson, 1999] 
0.25 
Qenv  



σ ×ε





T_eff = effective sink Temp, K 
Qenv  = environmental heat load 
ε = emissivity, 0.8 

T  eff
 =

_

where,	

(16)


The radiation off of the vehicle due to the paint is considered to be: 
Q _  passive = 0.6 × SA ×σ ×ε × (T _ eff  4  − T 4 
) 
space 

(17) 

where,	

Q_passive = radiation off vehicle, W 
SA = surface area of vehicle 
Tspace  = temperature of space, 3 K 

The factor of 0.6 accounts for the factor of the paint facing space. The rest of the paint is 
facing the thermal environment, and does not radiate heat. 

The heat that must be reduced for driving time and science time is then computed for this 
worst-case scenario. From HSMAD [Larson, 1999], the radiator area at the higher 
latitudes can be found by taking the heat dissipated and dividing by 251. 

At this point, the trade analysis is undertaken, as either a vertical or horizontal radiator 
can be chosen. The vertical radiators dissipate heat bi-directionally, but require extra 
support mass. The horizontal radiators only dissipate heat in one direction, but have much 
less support mass. Included with the radiators are heat pumps, plumbing, fluids, and 
controls. The exact data from HSMAD [Larson, 1999] regarding parametric equations 
can be seen in the code attached in the appendix. 

Additionally, the night time environmental data along with the average science time heat 
load (assumed to be smaller than driving heat load) were compared from the night time 
radiation due to paint in order to determine the amount on multi-layered insulation (MLI) 
needed in this worst case scenario. Using parametric equations from HSMAD [Larson, 
1999], this mass and volume were computed as well.

Overall feasibility check on design 

The code is set up to run the exact same procedures for Mars. It is assumed that the 
internal fluid workings would not need to change, just perhaps the size of the radiators. 
This design should be acceptable anywhere on Mars, and at the poles on the Moon, as 
mentioned previously at any time. During lunar noon at the equatorial region, an 
additional thermal dissipation system, such as a reusable phase change system, may be 
necessary due to the high environmental heat flux. [Eckart, 1999] For Earth, the radiators 
could be replaced by a convection system, again without disruption to the internal fluid 
system. 

For the unpressurized elements, the design is similar. The same set of equations were 
used, but some louvers were added to protect sensitive equipment and a small phase 
change mass for heat dissipation in addition to the small radiators, as seen in Figure 68: 
LRV thermal system These additions were based on the LRV, with information from a 
study on the Apollo 15 mission. [Costas, 1972]

Appendix to Section 4.4.2, Radiation Subsystem 
The radiation system is very dependent on environmental factors, namely Galactic 
Cosmic Radiation (GCR) and Solar Particle Events (SPE), which are commonly referred 
to as solar flares. The GCR is a relatively constant background source, although it varies 
with the solar maximum and minimum. SPEs happen more frequently at the maximum of 
the solar 11 year cycle, but are generally negligible to nonextistent during the solar 
minimum. [Larson, 1999] Each of these factors presents a different problem, which will 
be discussed further here to explain the choice of trades. 

While 95% of the GCR is light-weight atoms easily stopped by shielding, the remaining 
portion (called HZE particles) are much heavier nuclei. When they interact with the 
typical shielding used on Earth, these ions start to cascade, creating an even worse 
radiation environment. Studies have shown that materials with high hydrogen content 
provide the best shielding from GCR, so water, liquid hydrogen, liquid methane, and 
other high hydrogen content materials are being considered for a long-duration space 
mission. [Larson 1999] A polyethylene (another high H material) shield was tried on ISS, 
but proved ineffective. [SpaceToday 2002] 

SPEs are mostly high energy protons and electrons, with some additional heavier atoms 
that are created in the sun’s atmosphere. They do not last for very long periods of time, 
2
but can have very high flux values (up to 4.5 mW/m ), which are quite dangerous to 
human beings. While typical shielding in the aerospace industry, such as aluminum, is 
effective against these natural phenomena, the resulting mass is quite large. Ideally, the 
camper would not need any shielding at all, and the astronauts could simply return to 
base. [Parnell 1997] However, the lead time when scientists can predict these events is 
very small. Once thought to be on the order of hours, an event in January of 2005 reached 
Earth 15 minutes after it was detected. [Caron 2004] If astronauts are traveling up to 100 
km away from their base, then the pressurized element must have some shielding. The 
unpressurized elements do not have shielding, as it is hoped that the lead time will have 
increased to the point that astronauts can have at least 3-4 hours of warning. 

NASA has developed levels of acceptable radiation, outlined in the NASA-STD-3000. 
The critical number analyzed here is a maximum 50 REM exposure per year. 
(Additionally, the exposure over a month-long period is 25 REM, and the lifetime value a 
factor based on the astronaut’s age. All these numbers need to be evaluated for future, 
higher fidelity designs that take into account transit and base radiation levels.) [NASA ­
STD-3000] 

The initial design called for two levels of shielding: one thin layer around the top and 
sides of pressurized shell for protecting against GCR and a much larger layer to protect 
against SPEs around the airlock, which would be used as a shelter in case of a solar 
particl event. However, later decisions were made to assume that the astronauts could 
sleep in the airlock, which removed the need for the additional GCR shielding, which was 
on the order of 750 to 1000 kg originally. 

From NASA-STD-3000, the average GCR at 1 AU was found to be 55 REM. The SPE 
was modeled after the six major events in 1989, which should be a conservative estimate. 
2	
2
The shielding values are in g/cm , which is the areal thickness. This is the mass per cm
of surface area that an incoming particle would encounter. Therefore, across these 
thicknesses, the mass is constant no matter the material, making it a better comparison 
metric than a simple linear thickness. From the work of Wilson, et al. a figure was found 
that identified various materials’ ability to stop GCR [Wilson 1997]. The Lunar Base 
Handbook had a figure giving similar data for the 1989 SPEs. [Eckart 1999] 

In addition to the radiation shielding, the material already in the camper can help stop 
2
radiation. It was assumed that the airlock itself provided 4 g/cm in material. The entire 
vehicle structure, thermal components, etc., were assumed to stop an additional 5% of the 
SPE, a conservative estimate. Being low hydrogen materials, they would not stop any 
GCR, but rather cause cascading. The GCR total (55 REM) was divided by 1.75 to 
account for this occurrence, instead of by 2, since the Moon (or Mars) blocks half of the 
radiation value. 

The different materials tried are seen in the following table: 

Water 
Lithium hydride 
Aluminum 

Table 36 Trade Options 
Liquid hydrogen 
Liquid methane 
Polyethylene 

2
Each material was incremented by a factor of 0.5 g/cm until it was able to reduce the 
GCR and SPE radiation to less than 50 REM, given the constraints discussed previously. 
The code can be seen in the appendix. 

The outputs of this code are simply the radiation mass and volume, based on covering the 
top and sides of the airlock, with more material needed on top than nearer the bottom. 

For Earth, no shielding is necessary, so this subsystem should be designed to be easily 
removable. The GCR on Mars is approximately 58 REM, but the SPE is reduced due to 
the increased distance from the sun. The values for Mars for the SPE were simply 
reduced by ¼ as a conservative estimate, since very little is known about how much the 
atmosphere and magnetic field protect the planet. [Beaty 2005] A delta can be calculated 
here so any changes can be made for the new environment. 

Overall, a number of questions need to be addressed before a decision can be made on the 
realistic shielding for exploration.

Driving Operations 
General Observations 
w  Max speed  limited even on smooth terrain:  small,  infrequent craters w i l l 
jost le the  vehicle 
Reduce steering feedback: driver  fat igue 
w  4-wheel  drive very  useful for traction  and stability 

w  Riding for  two  hours straight was  very t ir ing  (without a space suit) 
w  Need sh ifts and rests for  long non-stop traverses 

Overworking the Vehicle 
w  Perceptions of terrain  not always  accurate 
w  Know your vehicle  limits (i.e. training) 
w  Dynamic feedback on current grade 
w  LlDAR system  to  analyze  upcoming terrain? 

Question: Can you perform science investigation while driving?

Vehicle Design 

Transmission 
w  Reverse gears are  important! 
w  Reversing trailer  difficult, especially on  rough terrain 
w  Multiple gears:  low gears needed for  difficult terrain,  high gears for  speed 
w  Potential dust contamination problem 

Turning Radius 
w  Important for  obstacle avoidance 
w  Dependent on  distance  between hitch and trailer  (tongue) 
w  Shorter trailer tongue  = shorter  turning  radius but possibility of jackknifing 

Vehicle Components 
w  Methods to  secure astronauts during traverse 
w  Separate emergency  fue l  reserve  if  main power J  fue l source  is damaged

Multi-Vehicle Coordination 

Driving Configuration 
w  Drive inline  if  the terrain was uncertain or allowed  for  only  one  path 
w  Drive tandem otherwise  (faster) 

Following Distance 
w  Minimum distance  restricted  by dirt plume, braking distance 
w  Maximum  distance  restricted by line of  sight,  path following 

Navigation 
w  Guide: stop and explain  area  up ahead 
w  Without  a guide, would  need maps and more frequent stops to  plan 
traverses over difficult terrain 

Communications 
w  Some communication while  moving ( i .e .  requests to  slow down) 
w  Detailed planning while  stopped: unable to  do en-route

Towing Operations 
Driving Properties 
w  Sluggish acceleration 
w  Shift to  lower gears to  pull up slopes:
speed alone may be insufficient 
w  Extended stopping distance 
w  Trailer doesn't follow 
exactly: may catch onto 

- 1 

All-powered wheels: useful on steep grades or difficult 
terrain, but may not always be necessary 

Safety 
w  Need system to monitor stability of trailer 
w  Consider tip-over failures  if trailers are t o p - h e a h  
w  Quick release method without  leaving the vehicle

Contingency Operations 
I 
Test Results 
I.  Steering and throttle: extracted easily  I 
! 
2.  No steering or throttle: rope snapped 
; 
3.  Assisted, no throttle: can't get out -
l-.--4 
had to use the throttle 

Lessons learned 
w  Sometimes need throttle to  extract 
w  Consider different vehicle orientations 
for extraction (pull from  back) 
4  Terra in  m a y  no t  a l low  th i s  
w  W e  were cautious with  rope since it 
snapped earlier: need proper cable
