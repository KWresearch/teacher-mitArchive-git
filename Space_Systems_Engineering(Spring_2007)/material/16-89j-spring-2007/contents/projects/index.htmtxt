                     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has outlined plans
                     to return humans to the Moon by the year 2020. Because of the inherent        Presentation

                     This year's design effort focused on crewed surface mobility systems for the
                     Moon, Mars, and analog sites on Earth, supporting the Vision for Space
                     Exploration (VSE).

                     similar to Antarctic research stations. Later missions would begin Mars
                     development, beginning around 2030, using conjunction-class trajectories to
                     provide surface stays of 500-600 days.
                     On January 14, 2004, President George W. Bush presented the nation with a
                     bold new initiative to "explore space and extend a human presence across our
                     solar systemâ¦using existing programs and personnelâ¦one mission, one
                     voyage, one landing at a time." (Bush, 2004) NASA was charged with the task   Presentation

                     performance. Second, how does one architect a sustainable space exploration
                     system? The following report makes the case that the primary purpose of an
                     exploration system is the delivery of knowledge to the stakeholders, and that
                     the design should be evaluated with respect to knowledge.

                     A fundamental activity during the conceptual design phase for a large project
                     is the comparison of competing system architectures. The ASTRO team has
                     developed a process and a software tool, based on a quantitative systems
                     engineering methodology, to conduct trade studies during the conceptual
                     design phase of the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) mission, which is
                     scheduled to launch in 2010. The TPF Mission Analysis Software (TMAS) package
                     consists of 6 macro-modules that model the physics and processes that
                     distinguish between competing system architectures, including structurally
                     connected (truss) and separated spacecraft (formation flying) concepts.
                     Ultimately, each design is evaluated by a performance assessment module       Presentation
      Terrestrial    (GINA), which computes the capability, performance, and cost of each          (PDF_-_1.0

      mission        architectures against each other. This metric represents the ratio of the     Report (PDF
                     total lifecycle cost of the mission divided by the number of useful "images"  -_2.9_MB)
                     returned, where "images" represent the total number of surveys and
                     spectroscopic observations accomplished during the mission lifetime. Limited
                     resources, in the form of personnel and time, determined the level of
                     fidelity incorporated into the model. The team focused on developing models
                     for the processes with the greatest likelihood to contribute to the
                     differentiation between architectures. After using benchmark spacecraft
                     configurations, previously developed by industry teams, to validate the TMAS
                     package, the team conducted one dimensional trade studies from a baseline
                     spacecraft configuration to evaluate general trends.
