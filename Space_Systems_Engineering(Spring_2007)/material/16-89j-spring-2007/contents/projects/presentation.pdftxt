Approach

♦ Methods Used:
• Stakeholder analysis
• Concept enumeration and downselection
− Multiple parallel studies and rigorous methodologies
− Done in the context of existing and proposed telescope designs
• Detailed concept design
− Lunar and free-space options were considered
♦ Tools and Models Used:
• LIRA integrated telescope modeling tool
− In-house design (similar to ICEMaker)
− Excel-based
• Pugh rankings
• Morphological matrices
♦ Significant deviations from the original intent of the baselined TDS
• Two telescope designs were carried to completion, instead of one

Moon Dust Issues

♦ Mechanical
Dust varies in size and shape and can infiltrate and contaminate
•
mechanisms
Dust is electrostatically charged and is hard to remove 
•
♦ Optical
Scattering, diffraction
•
− Dust on mirrors disrupt source signal from 
reaching detectors
Emission
− Detector infiltration serious problem
− Thermal issues of dust on optics (cid:198) found not to 
be a problem

Dust Mitigation Concepts

♦ Sealing/containment
Sensitive instruments need tightly sealed designs and redundant 
•
layers of protection
Landing site built with containment wall to limit dust dispersion
•
♦ Moving mechanisms
Loose, flexible covers with well sealed interfaces, allowing 
•
rotation/movement while keeping dust out
♦ Mirror covers
Cover during launches/landings since kicked up dust is distributed 
•
over Moon’s surface many tens of kms
♦ Regolith sintering
For serviceability by humans or robots, sinter lunar surface with 
•
microwaves reduces amount of lofted dust
“Glass road”
•
♦ Electrostatic cleaning based on sequence of ac pulses
Testing conducted by Carlos I. Calle (lead scientist at NASA's 
•
Electrostatics and Surface Physics Laboratory at Kennedy Space 
Center) worked well
Looking to obtain real Moon samples 
•
♦ Polyimide mirror coating to reduce sticking
Low surface energy reduces attraction
•
Harder, more resistant than Teflon
•
♦ Ultrasonic vibration to move dust off optics
Zenith-pointing through Cassegrain
•
Horizon-pointing off edge of mirror
•

with angular resolution
represents the time it takes for a survey of half of the sky to a 
target sensitivity over the entire frequency band
represents the resolution at which the EOR can be observed

♦ Logarithm and square root used to balance the components and reflect

RF Power Systems and Structures

♦ Each Cluster
12-W solar-panel & batteries systems
•
Continuous operation with 70% sunlight
•
19 kg & $7,000 power system
•
♦ Central Processing Unit
230-W solar-panel & batteries systems
•
Continuous operation with 70% sunlight
•
400 kg & $145,000 power system
•
♦ Major Considerations
Substituting RTG reduces mass by 380 kg but increases total cost including launch by $13M
•
Significant batteries required (4.2 ton) for 210-hr night
•
Locating telescope closer to equator significantly increases battery mass for a solar powered system and tends toward using an RTG
