16.89 Mission Statement 
The  goal  of  the  16.89  Space  Systems 
Engineering  class  is  not  to  come  up  with  a 
single  point  design  that  would  satisfy  the 
TPF  mission  requirements.  Consideration 
of  a  single  point  design  to  satisfy  the 
mission  requirements  has  been  performed 
previously  by  different  industrial  teams 
such  as  TRW  and  Lockheed  Martin.  Thus 
far,  only  a  structurally  connected  system 
thoroughly  considered  and 
has  been

Comparisons  between

(SCI) 
and 
a 
separated  spacecraft  interferometer  (SSI) 
have  been  performed  at  the  MIT  Space 
Systems  Laboratory 
by  Surka 
and 
Stephenson 
in  previous  research  work. 
Since  the  scope  that  they  considered  is 
rather  limited,  it  is  not possible  to  conclude 
from  their  studies  as  to  which  architecture 
should  be  chosen,  though  the  more  recent 
study  (Stephenson)  tends  to  favor  the  SSI 
design for longer interferometer baselines. 

Therefore,  in  order  to  fairly  assess  the 
different architectures proposed  for  the TPF 
mission,  the  fundamental  mission  objective 
of this class is to develop a methodology for 
the comparison of the different architectures 
spanning  from  a  structurally  connected 
interferometer 
(truss) 
to  a 
separated 
spacecraft system. 

The  level  of  detail  in modeling  the  physics, 
costs,  operations  etc…  for  the  TPF  mission 
was  determined 
so 
that  we 
could 
confidently  conduct  comparisons  of  the 
relative  merit  of  competing  architectures. 
The  team  members  do  NOT  claim  that  the 
level  of  design  detail  presented  here  is 
highly  accurate  in  an  absolute  sense  and 
that  this  CDR  would  be  sufficient  to  begin 
the  fabrication  phase  for  a  future  TPF 
mission. The methodology developed here 
should however be useful  for  understanding 
fundamental relationships and trends of the 
potential and competing architectures.

Impact of Scien e Targets on TPF

ce Targets on TPF
Impact of Scienc

The main tasks of TPF are direct planet detection and 
spectroscopy to determine if emission or absorption lines 
that are markers for life are present in a planets EM spectrum. 

The key to success is the accurate

nulling of the parent star, while maintaining

a high transmissivity to the planet’s signal.

The parent stars key characteristics are: 


• Absolute Stellar Magnitude [M] 
• Average Surface Temperature [K] 
• Distance from Observer [pc] 
• Absolute Star Diameter [km] 

How do these 
affect the 
engineering 
design of TPF ? 

6 

The  science  requirements  of  the  astrophysics  community  and  the  properties  of 
the  parent  stars  are  crucial  in  designing  TPF  and  are  driving  the  engineering 
requirements  for  the  mission.  Specifically  TPF  is  designed  for  direct  planet 
detection  in  the  IR  regime and  for  spectroscopy. As mentioned  before  the  three 
single most critical factors that drive the scientific performance are: 

• Suppression of parent star light of 10-6  over the diameter of the star 
• Maximum transmissivity in the habitable zone (0.5-3 AU) 
• Cold optics (~ 30K) and detector for maximum SNR in the 7-17 μm range 

This  slide  shows  that  the  properties  of  a  particular  star  in  the  target  star 
population  are  important,  since  they  are  directly  related  to  the  engineering 
requirements  that  we  need  to  design  TPF  architectures  and  conduct  our  trade 
studies.  Specifically  the  three  properties  of  the  parent  star  that  we  want  to 
investigate are: 

• Absolute stellar magnitude [M] -> drives the depth of null  needed 
• Average surface temperature [K] -> drives Planck spectrum and wavelength l 
• Distance from observer drives [pc] -> drives angular resolution and baseline 
• Absolute star diameter [km] -> drives width of null

This  chart  shows  the  so-called  Hertzsprung-Russell  Diagram.  This  diagram  is 
useful because  it  allows  to  trace  the  characteristics  and  the  evolution  of  stars  based 
on  their  surface  temperature  and  their  luminosity.  On  the  x-axis  we  represent  the 
temperature of a particular star in degrees Kelvin , decreasing from left to right. The 
stars  are  binned  into  spectral  classes  according  to  their  temperature:  O,B,A,F,G,K 
and M.  G  class  stars  are  also  referred  to  as  being  “sunlike”.  The  luminosity metric 
on the right side L/Lo is the ratio of the luminosity of a star to the luminosity of our 
own  sun.  The  scale  of  the  left  represents  the  luminosity  as  the  absolute  stellar 
magnitude  M  (not  to  be  confused  with  relative  magnitude  that  we  care  about  as 
amateur  astronomers).  Astrophysical  observations  show  that  stars  are  not  scattered 
randomly  in  the  HR-diagram,  but  that  they  are  grouped  in  certain  clusters  or 
“sequences”.  The  largest  number  of  stars  can  be  found  in  the  “main  sequence”  in 
the  middle  of  the  diagram  (a),  our  Sun  is  thus  part  of  the  main  sequence  of  stars. 
There is also a considerable number of stars in the “Giants” branch (g) and a smaller 
number of stars in the “Supergiants” branch (g). The number of “White Dwarfs” (d) 
and  “Red  Dwarfs”  (b)  that  can  be  observed  is  limited  due  to  their  relatively  small 
luminosity,  even  though  red  dwarfs  are  believed  to  comprise  the  majority  of  the 
total stellar population in our galaxy. 
For  the  purposes  of  TPF  we  will  be  searching  for  “earth”-like  planets  around 
“sunlike”  stars. This means  that  the main  focus  is on G  class  stars. This  entails  that 
the  surface  temperatures  of  our  parent  stars  will  be  in  the  4000-8000  K  range  and 
that Supergiants and dwarfs are excluded as candidates.

The  position  of  the  parent  star with  respect  to  TPF  (  can  be  expressed  in  ecliptic 
or  galactic  coordinates)  and  the  distance  will  determine  the  viewing  geometry. 
The maximum  distance  of  our  target  stars drives  the  angular  resolution, which  is 
necessary  to  achieve  the  isolation  requirement.  The  maximum  distance  was 
computed  to  be  15  parsecs  (  about  50  light  years)  based  on  the  abundance  of 
stars  in  our  stellar  neighborhood.  Since  we  are  located  on  an  outer  arm  of  the 
Milky  Way  galaxy  the  star  density  is  rather  low.  The  number  of  target  stars  is 
surprisingly  low.  The  table  below  shows  a  breakdown  of  candidate  stars  within 
our  viewing  limits.  The  total  number  of  candidate  stars  with  binaries  and  Giants 
removed from the list is about ~ 150 within a distance of 50 light years.

At a distance of 15 parsecs the angular resolution required for 0.5 AU planet 
detection is on the order of  40  milli-arcseconds. This corresponds to a baseline 
of  87.6 m for a wavelength of 17 μm.

Obviously  there  are  many  different  parameters  from  the  science 
requirements  and  it  would  be  difficult  to  account  for  all  of  them  in  the 
mission  analysis  software.  As  a  compromise  we  have  chosen  a  design 
point  of  a  G-class  target  star  at  10pc  at  a  wavelength  λ  =12  μm.  The 
wavelength  and  distance  both  lie  in  the  middle  of  our  design  range.  We 
are thus considering an “average” case. We will focus on planet detection. 

This  chart  shows  how  the  spectral  type  of  the  parent  star  affects,  where 
the peaks of  the blackbody  radiation  curve  occurs.  This  indicates  that  the 
SNR  for  the  IR  signal  of  the  planet  is  generally  poorer  at  smaller 
wavelengths,  since  the  signal  is  buried  in  the  strong  emissions  from  the 
parent star.

The movie that is shown during the CDR impressively demonstrates the process of 
planet detection. This movie was created by Robby Stephenson in the framework of 
his research work on TPF. The essentials of planet detection are as follows: 

12 Steps:  Quick Introduction to Direct IR Planet Detection 

1. Key to direct planet detection is nulling of the parent star 
2. The fringe pattern is a result of the transmissivity function and has 
characteristic dark and light lines (areas of high and low gain) as seen above 
3. The central fringe (null) is always destructive so that star light is suppressed 
4. The above pattern corresponds to a linear array, 2D-patterns are more complex 
5. Detection is achieved by rotating the array about the boresight axis to the star 
6. If a planet exist its IR signal will come through, each time a lobe sweeps by 
7. The IR signature is measured as a function of rotation angle 
8. A planet  that is further away from the star has a signal that varies faster 
9. A star that is closer in has a slower varying signal 
10. If several planets exist the total signal is a superposition of the individual signals 
11. The individual planets signals can be isolated by using Fourier transforms 
12. The quality of TPF is measured by the depth of null, gain of the lobes and 
by the location of the first lobe with respect to the center of the star

Summary: 

The Systems Engineering Process section demonstrates the methods, tools and 

steps we followed to solve the mission objective for 16.89. First  we lay out the 

requirements of the TPF mission itself. Then we describe the requirements of 

the software that embodies the quantitative mission analysis methodology. We 

show how we organized the team and how this organization evolved over time 

to meet the changing project requirements. Finally we focus in on the software 

development process itself and on the N2-diagram, that was used as the main 

interface control document.

Simulation Modules 
The majority of the classes effort during the Critical Design Phase has been to 
develop the software modules that constitute the TPF Mission Analysis Software 
(TMAS).  Individual responsibilities are shown in the chart and descriptions of the 
modules are provided later in this presentation. 

Simulation Integration 
The three team members assigned to this effort were responsible for integrating the 
6 macro-modules and their sub-modules into a single Matlab routine that could be 
used to perform the simulations.  As part of this effort, a graphical user interface 
(GUI) was developed to facilitate correct execution of the simulation with valid 
input parameters. 

CDR Presentation 
These three team members were responsible for integrating the presentation 
materials and conducting the CDR. 

Documentation 
The documentation team is responsible for creating the “TPF Mission Architecture 
Analysis Document”, which represents a comprehensive record of the activities 
performed by the team to evaluate the TPM mission architectures.

Action Items from the PDR 
During the PDR, comments and suggestions made by the professors and guests 
were documented and posted on the class web page as action items.  Individual 
class members addressed these action items in the following manner: 
1) 	 Modifications and Improvements of Sub-modules 
Many modifications and improvements for particular sub-modules were 
recommended at the PDR.  These suggestions were used by the author of each sub-
module to improve the accuracy and detail of his MATLAB function.  The impact 
of these specific changes will be addressed in detail during the discussion of the 
TPF Mission Analysis Software. 
2)  	 Create a Benchmark with the TRW and Lockheed Martin designs for TPF 
The benchmarking process and results are discussed in detail during the 
presentation of the TPF Mission Analysis Software (slides ). 
3) 	 Local vs. Global Optimization 
Rather than using a global optimization strategy that could be very time-
consuming and prone to error, we chose to break down this optimization between a 
smaller subset of modules.  Specifically, we combined the bus and payload sub-
modules to optimize mass and power.  Also, we integrated ADCS with dynamics to 
accurately model and correct spacecraft disturbances.  These optimizations will also 
be discussed in greater detail during the TMAS presentation. 
4) 	 Translate Technology Look-up Tables into MATLAB functions 
Wherever possible, MATLAB functions have been used to replace 
technology look-up tables.  These functions are more adaptable to changes in the 
baseline design, which improves the overall accuracy of the computer model.

Requirements Overview 
Once  a  proposal  for  any  system  is  received,  the  engineer  must 
translate  the  intended  purpose  or  function  of  the  system  into  a 
list  of  requirements  that  must  be  met  if  the  system  is  to  work. 
This  process  of  generating  requirements  from  user  needs  is

framework  within  which  he  must  work  as  well  a  method  for 
gauging his progress on the system design. 

There  are  three  types  of  requirements  that  must  be  specified. 
The  first  is  the  science  requirements.  These  define  what  the 
system should do  according  to  the  user  needs.  In  the  situation 
of  TPF,  the  user  needs  are  basically  the  science  requirements 
because  the  system  must  provide  the  end  user  (the  scientist) 
with  the  information  he  desires.  The  science  requirements 
were  collected  from  various  sources  including  the  Origins 
Roadmap  web  page  and  the  TPF  book.  These  requirements 
specify  the  function  of  the  system,  but  not  the  form  that  the 
proposed design should take. 

The  next  level  of  requirements  is  the  system  requirements. 
These  define 
the  physical 
limitations  and 
the  specific 
capabilities 
for  system  acceptance. 
that  are  necessary 
Basically,  the  system  requirements  define  how  the  entire 
system  must  perform.   Again,  these  requirements  define  the 
function  of  the  system  and  leave  the  form  to  lower  level 
requirements.  The system  requirements are driven not only by 
the  science  requirements  but  also  are  influenced  by  outside 
factors, such as budget, launch 

14 

schedules,  etc.  These  external drivers must be  factored 
in when deriving these requirements. 

The third and lowest level of requirements  is  the design 
requirements.  With  these  requirements,  the  engineer 
determines  the  form  that  each  subsystem  must  take  so 
that  the  overall  system  will  meet  the  user  needs. 
However,  the  goal  of  our  class  is  to  explore  the  trade 
space  open  to  TPF  and  not  to  arrive  at  a  specific  point 
design.  Therefore,  our  design  requirements  serve  as  a 
framework  for  design  of  each  subsystem  but  do  not 
specify its exact form.  These requirements are typically
restricted  by 
laws  of  physics  and  standard 
the 
engineering practices. 

In  the  process  of  generating  requirements,  the  engineer 
must  keep  two  important  concepts  in  mind.  First,  he 
must  understand  the  intent,  or  the  purpose,  of  a  given 
requirement.
  Second,  he  must  think  about  how  to 
verify  that  each  requirement  has  been  met.  The  intent 
and  verification  of  each  requirement  must  be  known  if
the requirements are to be of use to the engineer.

It  is  important  that  the  engineer  take  the  requirements 
process  seriously  because  his  proposed  system  design 
must  meet  these  requirements  or  he  risks  losing  his 
contract  with  the  end  user.  All  levels  of  requirements 
need  to  be  carefully  considered  before  the  systems 
engineering process is continued.

TPF Mission Requirements 
The  overall  mission  of  the  Terrestrial  Planate  Finder  (TPF) 
is  to  locate,  detect,  and  classify  Earth-like  planets  around 
nearby  stars.  Also,  the  TPF  system  will  be  used  to  study 
astrophysical  phenomena  such  as  galaxies,  planet  forming 
regions,  etc.  These  objectives  are  the  science  requirements 
for  this  mission  that  must  be  met  by  any  proposed  system 
design.  System  constraints  such  as  spectral  class  of  the 
parent  star,  proximity  of  stars,  and  mission  lifetime  allow 
for surveys of approximately 150 stars and  image of around 
1000 astrophysical objects. 

The science requirements drive many design alternatives for 
the  TPF  spacecraft.  First  of  all,  planet  detection  can  occur 
only  if  the  starlight  from  its  parent  star  is  suppressed  to  a 
high  enough  level  where  light  from  a  planet  can  be 
observed.  Also,  the  requirement  that  both  planets  and 
astrophysical  objects  must  be  surveyed  requires  the  use  of 
an  interferometer  with  a  tunable  baseline.  This  allows  the 
system  to  provide  a  sufficient  level  of  angular  resolution 
based  on  the  object  being  surveyed.  Furthermore,  certain 
signal-to-noise ratio and  spectral  resolution minimums must 
be met  to ensure sufficient  image quality  for usable  images. 
Finally, the science requirements constrain the imaging time 
to ensure  that a sufficient number of  stars  and  astrophysical 
sources  are  surveyed  throughout  the  mission  lifetime. 
There are other aspects of  the  system design  that  are driven 
by the science requirements, but those 

considered  here  have  the  greatest  impact  on  the  design 
options. 

Using  the  science  requirements,  our  class  developed 
system  and  design  requirements  to  govern  our  system 
design.  Instead  of  following  the  traditional  format  of 
listing  the  requirements  in  a  document,  we  used  an 
electronic  format  instead.  When  requirements  are 
listed  in  a  document  format,  it  is  difficult  to  see  how 
they  relate  to  one  another.  Also,  a  document  is  not 
readily  adaptable  to  changes  and  the  importance  of  the 
requirements  can  be  forgotten  as  the  system  design 
process  continues.  The  electronic  format  alleviates 
these  problem  by  linking  the  requirements  together. 
The  science  requirements  are  linked  to  the  system  and 
design  requirements,  allowing  a  user  to  see  what 
relationship  a  given  requirement  has  to  those  from 
higher and lower  levels.  In addition,  these  links ensure 
an  effective  parent-child  relationship  between  all 
requirements.  This  greatly  simplifies  configuration 
control  because  its  easy  to  isolate  and  to  trace  how  a 
change  in  one  requirement  impact  its  “children”  in 
lower  level.  Finally,  the  electronic  format  allows  for 
easy bookkeeping of the source, intent, and verification 
for  all  requirements.  All  of  these  aspects  of  the 
electronic  format  help 
the  engineer 
to  use 
the 
requirements  as  a method of  to gauging  his  progress  in 
developing a viable system design.

This  charts  summarizes  the  key  requirements  for  the  TPF  mission  analysis 

software.  It  is  important  to  recognize  that  the  class  was  not  only  to  meet 

requirements  for  the  TPF  mission  itself,  but  that  there  was  a  second  set  of 

completely  different  requirements.  This  second  set  was  a  driver  for  the 

design of the TMAS software itself and for the software development effort.

This  chart  is  supposed  to  illustrate  the  evolution  of  our  team  structure  over 
the  course  of  the  project.  During  the  conceptual  design  phase  the  team  had 
frequent  plenary  meetings  to  discuss  requirements  and  processes.  This 
required everyone’s participation. The preliminary design phase on the other 
hand  was  characterized  by  individual  work  and  bilateral  coordination  of 
software,  interface  and  other  technical  issues.  Finally  during  the  critical 
design  phase  the  organization  had  to  change  again  to  meet  the  new 
requirements.  The  three  teams  CDR  team,  Integration  team  and  the  Report 
team  were  created  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  deliverables  (1.  CDR 
Presentation,  2.  TMAS  Software  and  3.  Final  Report)  would  become 
available  on  time  and  within  the  expected  quality.  A  conclusion  from  our 
point  of  view  is  that  a  project  organization  cannot  be  rigid  but  must 
continuously  change  during  a  project  to  meet  the  challenges  of  each  phase 
in view of the next milestone.

This chart is a cornerstone of  the presentation since  it establishes  the relationship 
between  the  trade  space  for  TPF  and  the  metrics  by  which  we  will  judge 
competing architectures. Thus it contains the attributes that distinguish individual 
architectures.  There  are  fundamental  relationships  between  the  elements  of  the 
design vector and  the  capability metrics. For example  the number of apertures  in 
the  system  will  directly  affect  our  ability  to  shape  the  transmissivity  function. 
This  dictates  the  sharpness  in  the  rise  of  the  transmissivity  at  the  boundary 
between  the  exo-zodi  and  the  habitable  zone.  Hence  the  number  of  apertures 
drives the isolation metric (angular resolution). 

The  different  attributes  can  be  lumped  into  groups  of  modeling  needs  that  will 
allow  us  to  recognize  important  differences  between  competing  architectures. 
These  groups  directly  determined  the  macro-modules  that  would  be  require  to 
capture  the  TPF-relevant  relationships  of  physics,  cost  and  systems  engineering 
trades.  Thus  the  level  of  modeling  detail  is  high  only  for  aspects  that  matter  to 
TPF  and  that  help  us  distinguish  trends  within  the  trade  space.  As  mentioned 
before  the  shape  of  the  transmissivity  function,  dynamic  stability  and  thermal 
control are very important for the success of TPF. The communication system on 
the  other  hand  was  only  modeled  to  the  level  of  detail  necessary  to  obtain  a 
complete  mission  design.  For  example  a 
link  budget  is   included  but  not 
detailed  analysis  of  time  vs.  frequency  division  multiplexing  etc..  Such  aspects 
might  however  become  the  key  drivers  for  a  trade  analysis  of  a 
satellite 
communications constellation.

Software Development Process 
The development of  the TPF Mission Analysis Software  (TMAS) entailed eight discreet steps,  some of which were 
executed in parallel: 
1) Define S/W Objectives and Requirements 
2) Define S/W Macro-Modules 
3) Define All Interfaces 
4) Define S/W Sub-Modules 
5) Code Modules 
6) Test Code 
7) Integrate Code 
8) Benchmark Sanity Check 
The  first  step  entails  defining  exactly  what  user  would  like  the  software  to  do.  For  this  class,  the  objective  was  to 
create a software tool  to enable comparisons of different TPF designs on order  to map out  the system  trade-space.  The 
required  software  inputs  are  the  elements  of  the  design  vector  (orbit,  number  of  apertures,  architecture,  and  aperture 
diameter), and the desired outputs are  the GINA metrics.  After defining  the S/W objectives and  requirements,  the S/W 
macro-modules  must  be  defined.  Macro-modules  represent  distinct  aspects  of  the  design  which  have  high  coupling 
within  each  other,  but  low  coupling  between  each  other,  allowing  each  macro-module  to  be  coded  individually  by  an 
individual/team  with  expertise  in  that  area.  TMAS  contains  six  macr-modules:  Environment,  Aperture  Configuration, 
Spacecraft  (payload+bus),  Structures/Control/Dynamics,  Operations,  and  GINA.  Once  these  macro-modules  are 
defined,  the  interfaces  (variable  inputs/outputs)  between  them  must  be  explicitly  agreed  upon  by  all  of  the 
programmers.  This  ensures  compatibility between modules  and  speeds up  the  integration process.  Interface definition 
is  carried  out  in  parallel with  the  selection  of  the macro  and  sub-modules,  and  is  documented  in  the  N2  diagram.  The 
sub-modules are a division of each macro-module into it’s core components.  For example, each spacecraft subsystem is 
a sub-module in the spacecraft macro-module.  At this point, the code may be written.  It is important that all of the code 
be  thoroughly documented at  this  stage  so  that  it may  later be understood  and modified with  ease.  As  the modules  are 
completed,  they become  integrated  into a single “Master” code.  In parallel with both  the  coding  and  integration,  every 
module is continuously tested, both for correctness and compatibility.  Finally, after all of  the code has been  integrated, 
simulations  were  run  for  existing  TPF  designs.  By  comparing  the  TMAS  results  with  the  documented  design  data, 
modeling  errors  are  identified  and  the  fidelity  of  the  entire  simulation  is  improved  through  an  iterative  process.  Once 
the user is comfortable with the fidelity of the software, simulations may be run to map out the system trade-space.

Interface Control - N2  Diagram 
The TPF design process was divided into six macro-modules: 
•Environment 
•Aperture Configuration 
•Spacecraft (Bus + Payload) 
•Dynamics, Optics, Control, & Stability (DOCS) 
•Deployment & Operations 
•Systems Analysis - GINA 
Certain macro-modules were further subdivided into sub-modules.  This modular 
division  of  the  TPF  design  process  reduces  software  development  risk  by  reducing 
coupling  and  simplifies  the  simulation  code  development  as  each  module  is 
separately testable. 
An  N2  diagram  is  an  N  x  N  matrix  used  by  systems  engineers  to  develop  and 
organize  interface  information  (Boppe,  1998).  The  sub-modules  (Matlab  m-file 
functions)  are  located  along  the  diagonal  of  the  matrix.  The  inputs  to  each  sub-
module  are  vertical  and  the  outputs  are  horizontal.  The  aggregation  of  the  sub-
modules  into  macro-modules  is  illustrated  by  the  black  boxes  enveloping  different 
sections of the diagonal. 
The  N2  diagram  provides  a  visual  representation  of  the  flow  of  information 
through  the  conceptual  design  process  and  was  used  to  connect  all  of  the  Matlab 
functions to enable an automated simulation of different TPF architectures.

Summary: 

The goal of  this section  is  to  lay out  the structure and  functional  flow of  the 

macro-modules  that  make  up  TMAS.  Simulink  is  used  to  show  the 

interdependencies  of  the  individual  modules  and  the  flow  of  information. 

The  software  has  been  implemented  in  MATLAB  and  the  information  is 

passed  back  and  forth  in  the  form  of  data  structures.  The  CDR  will  focus 

more  on  the  top-level  issues  and  interconnections  rather  than  on  the 

individual  inputs,  outputs  and  contents  of  the  sub-modules,  since  this  was 

already done at the PDR.

TMAS Block Diagram 
In  order  to  determine  the  performance  of  a  particular 
TPF design,  a model  for  the  design must be developed. 
This  model  must  accurately  depict  the  operation  and 
performance  of  the  system  and  must  also  be  adaptable 
to  different  system  configurations.  We  have  divided 
this  model  into  6  macro-modules  that  focus  on  key 
parameters  of  the  system  design.  The  model,  also 
known as the TPF Mission Analysis Software  (TMAS), 
is  designed  to  explore  the  multiple  design  options 
available  for  TPF  and  determine  which  configuration 
will maximize the system performance. 
The  six  macro-modules  for  TMAS  were  defined  based 
on  the  most  significant  aspects  of  the  system  design. 
The model uses a design vector  that  is modified  to help 
explore  the  trade  space  available  to  the  system  design. 
The  TMAS  block  diagram  shows  how  the  information 
is  flowed  from  the  design  vector  through  each  of  the 
macro-modules  in  order  to  obtain  the  performance 
metrics  at  the  end  of  an  iteration.  Although  each 
macro-module does not necessarily  require  information 
from  the  previous  module,  the  linear  organization 
makes it easy to basic function of the model. 
In  reality,  the  TMAS  program  is  actually  much  more 
complex  than  the  block  diagram  would  indicate.  Most 
of  the  macro-modules  include  sub-modules  that  are 
used  to  model  more  detailed  aspects  of  the  system 
design.  A Simulink model of 

23 

the  TMAS  program  has  been  constructed  to  help  to 
illustrate exactly how the software works. 

The function of each macro-module is as follows: 
Environmental 
Provides 
interferometer’s 
local  environment  based 
upon the TPF operation orbit. 
Aperture Configuration 
Determines  the  optimal  aperture  configuration  required 
to meet the science objective 
Spacecraft Bus/Payload 
Calculates  the  distribution  of  mass  and  power  for  the 
payload  instruments  and  bus  subsystems  on  each 
spacecraft in the TPF architecture 
Dynamics, Optics, Control & Structures 
Constructs a model of a given configuration  to evaluate 
the  interferometer’s  achievable  control  and  disturbance 
rejection performance. 
Operations 
Determines  the  required  launch  vehicle  as  well  as  the 
cost  and  risk  associated  with  operation  of  the  TPF 
system. 
Systems/GINA 
Computes  the  performance  metrics  for  the  architecture 
based upon inputs such as SNR, costs, mass, operations, 
etc.

Key Equations 
In this and the following slides we state the equations that mainly capture the 
conceptual issues in the design of the TPF. 
The first aspect to be taken into account is given by the science requirements that 
drive the mission design. In this respect, the main performance measure is given by 
the quality of the nulling of the parent star by the interferometer. In the nominal 
case, this measure is given by the transmssivity function, that gives the percentage 
of the incoming light output at anomaly θ and wavelength λ. The transmissivity is a 
function of the geometric configuration of the array through the aperture sizes, 
baseline lengths, and phase delays. 
However, due to external and internal disturbances, the geometric configuration of 
the array will not always be at the nominal condition, hence some disturbance 
rejection devices have to be included in the system. The objective of the disturbance 
rejection can be formulated as a RMS optimization problem, that is the design 
objective is to minimize the resulting RMS on some parameters characterizing the 
geometric configuration, caused by the modeled disturbances. 
The overall effect of this design will be a performance measure that can be 
identified in a signal-to-noise ratio, that directly affects the Isolation and Integrity 
measures in GINA.

Key Equations 
The optimization problem described in the previous slides cannot be solved independently from other consideration, among 
which perhaps the most important is the resulting cost of the overall system, as well as the cost per function allowed by the 
system. 
The total cost of the system can be split into the cost due to the launch vehicle, the spacecraft bus, the payload, and operations. 
Data about these cost components are obatined as follows: 
•launch vehicle: data about launch vehicle cost are available from the literature 
•spacecraft bus: Cost Estimate Relationships are used 
•payload cost: the payload cost is made of a fixed component (per collector/combiner) plus varaible part that increases with 
the size of the mirror. According to NGST estimates, the cost of mirrors are increasing as the diameter to the 2.67. 
•Operations cost: the evaluation of the operations cost is a very complex issue; however, cost is strongly related to the overall 
operations complexity, defined as: 
J = Je + J fe + J f  =∑  1 1+ fi (n) 1− Ai  + X fe∑  1 1+ fi (n)  + X f ∑  1  (1+ fi (n)) 
n

(
where mttei,mttfei,mttfi  indicate the mean time to events, false events and permanent failures respectively, N is the total number 
of spacecraft, fi(N) is a relative increase in the event rate as a function of N, Ai  is the automation level, and finally Xfe  and Xf  are 
complexity adjustment factors, 
Since the main function of the TPF system is to provide images of the target stars, we can define a cost per image to be used in 
the performance analysis. This cost per image is given by the total cost, divided by the total number of images that are 
expected to be taken over the whole mission duration. This number is given by: 
1825  n

313  n

314 i =1 
257 i =1 
74  i =1 
where the limits of integration are the days for mode transition in the mission profile, i is the specific system state, n is the 
total number of possible functioning states, Csi,  Cmi and Cdi are the capabilities (imaging rates) in each state i , respectively in 
Survey,  Medium Spectroscopy,  and Deep Spectroscopy mode, and finally Pi(t) is the probability of being in state i at time t. 
Moreover, a mission inefficiency parameter can be defined, that takes into account the efficiency loss due to the finite time 
required for anomaly resolution: 

where Cy  is the  average number of transmission cycles for anomaly resolution, D is the transmission delay time, Ftotal  is the 
total failure rate, and Fi and ri  are respectively the failure rate and average recovery time for specific ops function.

26 

This  chart  shows  the  effect  that  the  reaction  wheel  imbalances  can  have  on 
the  transmissivity  function  and  ultimately  the  signal  to  noise  ratio.  The 
reaction  wheel disturbance data was obtained  from a  test of  the  ITHACO E-
Wheel conducted at NASA GSFC  in 1998. The wheel  speed distribution was 
assumed  to  be  uniform  between  0  and  2000 RPM.  The  combined  effect  of  4 
wheels in a pyramidal configuration is taken into account. 

The left subplot shows the effect of the reaction wheel imbalances that where 
obtained  from  the  test without  any modification  to  the  test  data. We  see  that 
the  transmissivity  has  four  symmetric  lobes  (fringes  of  peak  intensity)  and 
that  the  suppression  of  starlight  meets  the  specification  (upper  left  plot)  of 
10-6  out to the star diameter. 

The  right  subplot  however  demonstrates  the  effect  if  the  wheel  imbalances 
are  scaled  up  by  a  factor  of  10.  This  could  occur  if  the  wheels  are  poorly 
balanced  or  if  a  ball  bearing  failure  occurs  during  operations.  The  effect  on 
the  transmissivity  is  dramatic.  Firstly  we  notice  that  a  pair  of  fringes  is  now 
being washed out by the vibrations, secondly the nulling is no longer meeting 
requirements.  In  the  nominal  case  the  σOPD  (average)  is  76  nm,  where  it  is 
762  nm  in  the  second  case,  which  corresponds  to  roughly  λ/16.  For  non-
interferometric  systems  such  a  wavefront  error  might  be  acceptable.  In  the 
case  of  TPF  it  clearly  is  not  and  this  is  where  the  requirement  for  λ/6000 
comes  from.  Thorough  analysis  and  testing  of  reaction  wheel  imbalances 
before launch is paramount.

This  chart  shows  the  level  to  which  the  dynamics  and  controls  were 
captured.  The  effect  of  optical  control  on  the  system  is  modeled  using  a 
high-pass  filter  approach,  where  each  OPD  channel  is  attenuated  by  the 
optical  control  at  low  frequencies  but  not  at  high  frequencies  due  to  the 
limited sensor and actuator bandwidths . 

The chart shows  the effect of changing  the optical control bandwidth on  the 
transmissivity  function.  If  the  optical  control  bandwidth  is  too  low,  the 
optical  pathlength  differences  between  the  apertures  creates  a  time-varying 
phase  difference  φi  between  the  light  beams  at  the  combiner.  This  phase 
shift  disturbs  the  +/- 180  degree  phase  shift  required  for  perfect  nulling.  A 
simplifying  assumption  is  that  the  OPD’s  which  are  the  square  roots  of  the 
variance  of  a  stochastic  random  signal  are  added  to  the  phase  shift  used  to 
compute  the  transmissivity  (see  chart  on  key  equations),  as  if  they  were 
deterministic.  Thus  the  perturbations  from  the  perfect  transmissivity  shown 
above are to be understand in a 1 sigma sense. 

The preliminary results indicate that the science requirements cannot be met 
with  an  optical bandwidth  of  5 Hz,  but  increasing  the  bandwidth  to  100 Hz 
leads to sufficient suppression of the dynamic onboard disturbance sources.

Operations Definitions 
Our TPF class, realizing that operations costs typically comprise a large percentage of 
total mission cost, decided to incorporate operational considerations into the design 
trade space.  Usually operations design follows initial trade decisions made without 
operational input, but large differences in total mission cost and performance 
dependent on the operability of certain architectures encouraged an integrated 
approach. 
Areas of Impact 
Operational issues affect two main mission criterion: Cost and Performance.  The cost  

can be further split into development cost and operations cost.

Development costs are affected by the complexity level of the mission.  More 

complex missions require longer flight and ground software codes, which have a  

snowball effect on other key development costs shown in the slide.


Operations costs consist of labor and maintenance costs, and affect the mission 
throughout its useful life.  Labor costs are a function of crew size and salary which the 
class’s TPF software captures determines from estimated everyday operational 
complexity and failure recovery complexity.  Maintenance costs are modeled on the 
size and complexity of the flight operations center. 

System performance is affected by mission inefficiency, which is the science-
gathering time lost from transmission delay time and anomaly resolution time.

Effect of Operational Issues on System 
This slide explains the two ways operational issues affect the total mission. 

Operational difficulty leads to increased cost and is driven by system complexity. 
System complexity is driven, to a large degree, by the number of additional 
spacecraft to control, and the attendant increase in difficulty to ensure their 
cooperative functionality.  Therefore, a structurally connected spacecraft is easier to 
operate than a small cluster of separated spacecraft, which, in turn, is easier to 
operate than a more numerous cluster of separated spacecraft.  It should be pointed 
out that operating the five spacecraft of a 4 aperture SSI is not four or five times as 
complex as a single spacecraft SCI, since each additional collector spacecraft is 
comparatively simple with respect to the main combiner spacecraft.  Furthermore, 
learning curve effects, operational efficiencies, and automation attenuate the 
complexity increase from each additional spacecraft. 
Mission inefficiency impacts system performance (primarily imaging rate) and is 
affected by two factors, system unreliability and distance.  A less complex system 
will generate less anomalies, requiring less time to resolve those anomalies.  A 
closer system will suffer less transmission delay time.  Therefore, a close and 
reliable system reacts quickly to relatively few anomalies, while a distant and 
unreliable system reacts slowly to frequent anomalies.

The significant differences in this case concern the comm, thermal, power, and propulsion/propellant

subsystems (see the Reasons column in the table above).  However, the class estimates are reasonably

““A picture says more than a thousand words
A picture says more than a thousand words ””

Summary: 

The goal of the interactive test case is to give the “customer” a first hand look 

at  the  TMAS  software  and  the  sequence  in  which  the  analysis  is  run.  A 

number  of  figures  are  generated  during  the  run  that  will  be  explained  by  the 

most  knowledgeable  team  member.  A  representative  test  case  is  chosen  that 

exercises most of the important sub-modules. 

33 

Input Design Vector with GUI
Input Design Vector with GUI


The desired test 
cases are input 
manually with the 
GUI; alternatively 
the TMAS software 
can be run from 
a script in “batch” 
mode in order to 
run a large number 
of cases without 
operator input. 

34 

In  order to facilitate the running of the software a graphical user interface 
was programmed for TMAS. The interface allows even the inexperienced 
user to input a design vector and to execute the simulation automatically. 
Another advantage of the GUI is that it only allows inputs to be made that 
are within the allowable trade space. Thus a more detailed error checking 
inside of the code can be avoided.

Interactive Test Case 
The  purpose  of  this  interactive  test  case  is  to  show  the  audience  how  TMAS 
works  firsthand  in  real-time.  We  will  begin  by  entering  the  desired  design  vector 
into  the  graphical  user  interface  (GUI).  We  will  then  proceed  through  an  entire 
simulation run of TMAS, with several pauses during which we will explain how the 
program is working and what the results being displayed on the screen mean. 

Some of the highlights of the interactive test case include: 
•Generation of the optimal aperture configuration 
•Design of the spacecraft bus to minimize total mass 
•Creation of a TPF finite element model 
•Mode animations 
•Control system design and performance 
•Operations Evaluation 
•GINA Systems Analysis 

As each  simulation  requires  several minutes  to  run, we will only  be  able  to  carry 
out  one  during  the  formal CDR  presentation.  After  the  CDR,  however,  please  feel 
free to come up and try out your own design vector for TPF!

Summary: 

This section demonstrates the results and conclusions  that we obtained from 

exploring  the  trade  space  with  the  TPF  mission  analysis  software.  We 

demonstrate  the  dependence  of  a  number  of  internal  parameters  such  as 

RWA imbalances and optical control bandwidth on the system performance. 

More  importantly  the  trades  are  made  between  the  entries  of  the  design 

vector  and  our  capability  metrics.  A  useful  metric  for  comparing  very 

different architectures is the cost per image metric, assuming that all images 

(i.e.  surveys)  meet  the  required  SNR  requirements.  Important  trends  have 

become  visible  and  first  indications  of  “optimal”  design  corners  are 

becoming apparent.

Trade Study : Test Matrix 
The key objective of this project is to develop a framework 
in  which  the  trade  studies  between  different  architectural 
design  can  be  conducted.
  Taking  a  first  step  towards 
achieving  this  objective,  the  team  has  decided  upon  a  test 
matrix  where  the  results  from  the  different  cases  can  be 
compared  when  only  one  parameter  in  the  Design  Vector 
is  varied  at  a  time.  In  doing  so,  we  would  then  be  able  to 
determine  the  trends  by  which  certain  parameters  (cost, 
mass, etc.) change as a function of only one parameter. 
Even  though  we  could  have  perform  an  exhaustive  search 
for  the  “optimal”  solution  based  upon  the metric we  chose 
to  compare,  understanding  these  single  dimension  trends 
gave  us  considerable  insight  as  to  what  the  sensitive 
parameters  are  and  at  the  same  time,  confidence  in  our 
model.  An  exhaustive  search  of  the  trade  space  should 
only  be  performed  once  these  key  trades  are  understood. 
Based  upon  these  results,  it  may  be  possible  to  reduce  the 
search space from the possibly infinite number of designs.. 
In  order  to  compare  the  different  test  cases,  the  team  has 
chosen  two  architectures  (SCI  and  SSI)  as  baseline  cases 
where  results  from  the  other  cases  shall  be  compared  to. 
The Design Vector parameters for the baseline case are:

Image Distribution vs. Orbit 
  At low orbits, the number of images is

by the local zodiacal dust. 
  For the same aperture configurations, 
this characteristic is independent of 
whether the spacecraft is SCI or SSI. 

Cost Distribution vs. Orbit 
  As orbit increases, the most sizable

Trade Studies:  Orbit 
The orbital trade study was conducted on both an SCI and an SSI of the following 
configuration:  4 apertures; 2 meters diameter each; linear, symmetric arrangement. 

Image Distribution vs. Orbit 
At low orbits, the number of images is limited by the lower SNR caused by the local 
zodiacal dust.  In these orbits, the density of the dust relative to the light gathering 
power of the 2 meter collectors causes the integration time to be longer for each 
image.  The plateau at about 1200 images represents the maximum number of 
images for this configuration based on factors other than orbit, such as instrument 
theoretical capabilities and other noise sources.  For the same aperture 
configurations, the total number of images as a function of orbit is independent of 
whether the spacecraft is SCI or SSI. 

Cost Distribution vs. Orbit 
As the orbital radius increases, the most sizable increases in cost are due to launch 
vehicle selection.  Both the mass of the spacecraft and the Delta V requirements 
increase as the orbit increases, but it is the Delta V requirement that drives the cost 
increases in the SCI case.  (See the next slide for more information on the mass 
trade.) 

Development and payload costs do not show any dependence on orbit, while 
spacecraft bus and operations costs show the expected increases with higher orbits, 
primarily due to the longer mission lifetime.

Total Mass Distribution vs. Orbit 
  For this SSI case, the large mass increases 
up to 4 AU are due to increasing solar 
array size to generate the required power. 
  At 4.5 AU and higher, RTGs are selected 
by the TMAS. 
  The growth in power system mass is 
driven further by the propulsion system, 
which must be more powerful (or use 
more propellant mass) to maneuver the 
greater total mass. 

Total Mass vs. Orbit by Architecture

Trade Studies:  Orbit 
Total Mass Distribution vs. Orbit 
As expected, the total mass of the spacecraft increases with orbital radius.  The 
effect is much more pronounced for the SSI architecture.  In this case, the 
propulsion systems on the separate spacecraft require a large amount of power 
relative to the rest of the spacecraft instruments to operate efficiently.  Thus, as the 
orbit increases, the size of the solar arrays required to provide this power will grow 
until the TMAS determines that an RTG of an equivalent or smaller mass can 
provide the necessary power.  For the orbit trade study architecture, this transition 
occurred at 4.5 AU. 
Propellant mass showed only a slight increase with orbit, indicating that rather than 
increasing propellant mass, it is more efficient to increase the power required by the 
propulsion system and to take the mass increase in the power system. 
The payload mass is not a function of orbit by the definition of this test case.  The 
effect of orbit on bus mass is relatively small.  In general, there is a slight positive 
correlation, but at the transition from solar arrays to RTGs, there is a more noticable 
jump due to the loss of the solar arrays as a layer in the passive cooling scheme. 
Total Mass vs. Orbit by Architecture 
The difference is due to the greater total bus mass associated with the multiple 
spacecraft in the SSI case.  Not only do the multiple spacecraft require a greater 
initial mass, but the rate of increase with orbit is also greater due to the higher 
power requirements of the multiple propulsion systems.  The dip in the graphs at 2.5 
AU is due to a change in the thermal control scheme resulting from the lower solar 
heat flux.

Cost per Image vs. Orbit 
  For low orbits, the higher cost per 
image is largely due to the lower 
number of total images. 
  For high orbits, the higher cost per 
image is largely due to higher 
launch costs. 
  The higher cost per image of the 
SSI case is primarily due to the 
greater total mass (higher launch 
costs) and to higher initial 
development costs. 

40 

Trade Studies:  Orbit 
Cost per Image vs. Orbit 
The total cost per image tends to increase at both ends of the orbital range, 
indicating that the optimum orbit (for the selected architecture) is within our range 
of consideration.  However, one factor not included in the TMAS is an explicit 
evaluation of the potential effects of placing the TPF in the asteroid belt between 
2.2 and 3.3 AU. 

For low orbits, the higher cost per image is largely due to the lower number of total 
images.  As discussed above, the lower number of images is due to the higher 
density of the local zodiacal dust that drives a longer integration time for each 
image. 

For high orbits, the higher cost per image is largely due to higher launch costs.  As 
mentioned previously, the higher launch costs are driven by the increased mass and 
Delta V requirements for the higher orbits. 

The higher cost per image of the SSI relative to the SCI is primarily due to the 
greater total mass (higher launch costs) and to higher initial development costs.  The 
development costs for the SSI case are higher due to the need to design (at least) 
two different spacecraft (collector and combiner) and to purchase more control 
system equipment rather than structural materials.

Trade Study : Number of Apertures (SCI) 
In this trade study, only the number of aperture parameter 
in  the  Design  Vector  is  varied  and  the  results  are 
compared  to  the  baseline  case.  The  trends  for  the 
expected  number  of  images  that  can  be  obtained,  the 
mass and the cost of the SCI architecture are shown.  The 
results from these plots are discussed below: 
SCI Image Distribution 
The  first  plot  shows  the  number  of  images  that  is 
expected  increases  with  the  number  of  apertures.  The 
increase is most significant when the number of apertures 
is  increased  from  four  to  six.  Besides  producing  better 
transmissivity  function  (deeper  and  wider  null)  with 
higher  number  of  apertures,  this  significant  jump  is  seen 
mainly  due  to  the  assumptions  made  in  the  Markov 
model.  In the Markov model, we assumed a total mission 
failure  will  occur  when 
there  are 
less 
than  four 
operational  apertures.  Hence,  in  the  four  aperture  case, 
the  expected  number  of  images  that  can  be  obtained  is 
lower  since  this  design  cannot  tolerate  any  failures. 
However,  as  higher  number  of  apertures  are  used,  we  do 
not lose the entire mission when some of its apertures fail 
as long as there are at least four operational apertures. 

41 

SCI Total Mass Distribution 
The plot of  the  interferometer’s mass  as  a  function  of  the 
number  of  apertures  shows  the  linear  dependence  of  the 
total  mass  against  the  number  of  apertures.  In  all  cases, 
the  bulk  of  the  interferometer’s  total  mass  is  dominated 
by  its  dry  mass,  of  which  more  than  50%  of  it  is  the 
structural  mass.  On  the  other  hand,  the  contribution  of 
the propellant mass to the total mass is small. 
SCI Cost Distribution 
The  total  life  cycle  cost  for  this  SCI  designs  increases 
with  the  number  of  apertures  in  the  design.  Both  the 
development  and  the  operation  costs  for  this  architecture 
remain  constant  since  we  are  dealing  with  only  one 
structure.  As  the number of apertures  is  increased,  larger 
launch vehicles are required.  In the case of 4 apertures, a 
Delta  3  rocket  is  required,  while  for  the  6  - 10  aperture 
cases,  a Delta 4  is  required  and  the  use  of  an  Ariane  5  is 
required  for  the 12  aperture  interferometer.  Both  the  bus 
and  the  payload  costs  can  be  seen  to  increase  linearly 
with  the  number  of  apertures,  which  is  also  a  trend 
observe with the bus and payload masses.

Trade Study : Number of Apertures (SSI) 
Similar  to  the  results  in  the  previous  slide,  the  trends  for 
the  Separated  Spacecraft  Interferometer  design  as  the 
number of apertures is varied are presented here. 
SCI Image Distribution 
Similar to the SCI results, the expected number of images 
increases  with  the  number  of  apertures.  Again,  a  sharp 
increase  in  the  total  number  of  images  is  again  observed 
when  the  number  of  apertures  is  increased  from  four  to 
six  and  again,  this  can  be  attributed  to  the  assumptions 
made in  the Markov  model.  Note that except  for  the  four 
spacecraft  case,  the  expected  number  of  images  is  higher 
than  the  results  shown  in  SCI  design.  This  is  mainly 
attributed  to  allowing  the  separated  apertures  to  re­
position  to  a  different  set  of  optimal  imaging  locations 
when  one  or  more  apertures  fail.  For  example,  the  SSI 
apertures  in  an  optimal  six  aperture  configuration  can  be 
re-configured 
to  assume 
the  optimal  five  aperture 
configuration  when  one  of  them  fail.  This  option, 
however,  is  not  available  to  the  SCI  and  will  therefore, 
explain the lower number of images obtained. 

42 

SSI Total Mass Distribution 
Similar  to  the  SCI  design,  the  total  mass  of  the 
interferometer  is  dominated  by  the  dry  mass  of  the 
interferometer.  However,  in  this  case,  the  propellant 
mass  makes  up  quite  a  significant  portion  of  the  total 
spacecraft  mass. 
In  reality,  the  amount  of  propellant 
required  for  the  SSI  is  in  fact  lower,  since  one  can  take 
advantage  of  square  maneuvering  profiles  where  the 
spacecraft  can  be  allowed  to  drift  while  no  propellant  is 
expended.   The  propellant  calculation  in  this  trade  study 
assumes the spacecraft traverses in a circular trajectory. 

SSI Cost Distribution 
Except for the sudden jump in the launch vehicle cost, the 
life  cycle  cost  for  this  design  increases  approximately 
linearly  with  the  number  of  apertures.   The  services  of  a 
Titan  4  is  required  for  the  12  aperture  case,  while  the  8 
and  10  aperture  cases  require  an  Ariane  5  class  launch 
vehicle and  the 4 and 6 aperture  interferometers  require  a 
Delta 4 rocket.

Trade Study : Number of Apertures (SCI vs SSI) 
Comparison between the two architectures (SCI and SSI) 
as the number of apertures is varied is presented in the 
slide. 
Total Mass Distribution - SCI vs SSI 
Comparison between the two architectures over  the  range 
of  apertures  shows  a  higher  total  mass  in  the  SSI  case. 
This  is  mainly  attributed  to  the  added  spacecraft  buses, 
structure  and  propellant  required  for  each  aperture.  In 
general,  the  SCI  requires  more  structural  mass  but 
surprisingly, its overall dry mass is less than that required 
by  the  SSI.  This  lower  dry mass  in  SCI  could  very  well 
due  to  the  rather  short  aperture  separations  required.  In 
this  analysis,  we  have  considered  planet  detection  as  the 
key  objective  and  only  a  maximum  baseline  of  120  m  is 
required.  However, if one were to take into consideration 
the  second  science  requirement  where  milli-arcsec 
resolution  imaging  is  required,  aperture  separations  of  at 
least 1 km  are  required.  This will  inherently  increase  the 
structural  mass  of  the  SCI  architecture  significantly. 
Correspondingly,  the  amount  of  propellant  required  to 
maneuver  the  different  spacecraft  in  the  SSI  case  will 
increase  too.  The  impact  of  varying  the  aperture 
separations  has  on  the  overall  architectural  mass  should 
be investigated 

Cost Distribution - SCI vs SSI 
Consistent  with  the  trend  observe  in  the  architectural 
mass  comparison,  the  life  cycle  cost  of  the  SSI  is  higher 
than the SCI.  This is true especially for designs with high 
number  of  apertures.
  This  higher  SSI  cost  can  be 
attributed  to  several  factors:  (1)  more  massive  design 
(from  mass  comparison),  (2)  larger  launch  vehicles 
required,  (3)  more  complex  operation  scenario  and  (4) 
higher  development  cost,  since  SCI  is  possibly  more 
technologically mature compare to realizing a SSI design. 

Cost per Image - SCI vs SSI 
Even 
life  cycle  cost, 
the  SSI  has  higher 
though 
comparisons between  the architectures should be perform 
based  upon  the  design’s  cost  per  function metric.  In  this 
case,  the  metric  is  the  amount  (in  $1000)  per  useful 
image.  This  third  plot  shows  the  cost  per  image  for  the 
two  architectures.  Even  though  we  observe  rather 
significant  difference  in  the  architecture’s  life  cycle  cost, 
the  difference  in  cost  per  image  metric  is  not  as  high. 
This  is  mainly  due  to  the  higher  number  of  images  that 
can  be  expected  from  the  SSI  design.  In  both  cases,  the 
“optimal” solution is to use the 8 aperture configuration.

Image Distribution vs. Interferometer Type 
–  The 1-dimensional, symmetric 
architectures have superior imaging 
capability. 
–  The 2-dimensional architectures 
collect less images because of nulling 
losses. (counter-intuitive result) 
–  The 4 collector array does not 
demonstrate the graceful degradation 
advantage of the SSI architecture. 

Mass Distribution vs. Interferometer Type 
–  There is almost no mass difference 
between the 1-dimensional and the 
2-dimensional architectures. 
–  The SSI architectures are more 
massive because each spacecraft 
requires a separate bus and the 
propulsion system is relatively 
inefficient. 

44 

Trade Study: Interferometer Type 
The architectures of interest for the systems level analysis of TPF are the: the SCI and SSI, 1 and 2 
dimensional cases. (All architectures evaluated thus far, were symmetric designs.) 

These four interferometer choices were traded for the (constant) configuration of 4 apertures, each 
having a 2 meter diameter; orbiting at 1 AU. 

Image Distribution vs. Interferometer Type 
The number of images, appears to be more dependent on the aperture configuration than on 
architecture type.  In this case, the one-dimensional architectures out perform the two-dimensional 
ones.  This is a counter-intuitive result because we naturally expect the two dimensional to be more 
efficient.  But the two-dimensional case does not null as well the one-dimensional case.  (Please 
consult Edmund if a question arises.) 

We would also expect the SSI case to be more efficient, a distinct architecture advantage.  This trade, 
however, does not show the graceful degradation capability of the SSI configuration.  The four 
aperture SSI (based on our failure analysis) is the smallest SSI configuration allowed.  So a single 
collector failure will cause a system failure, much like it always occurs in the SCI architecture.  If a 3 
or 2 collector array was feasible, then the 1-D SSI architecture would gain an advantage.  This 
advantage would also become clear if our baseline design consisted of more than  four spacecraft. 

Total Mass Distribution vs. Interferometer Type 
The total mass  of the SSI architecture is clearly larger the total mass of the SCI architecture.  There 
are several contributors to the additional SSI mass.  Some examples include the fact that: each 
collector spacecraft requires its own bus, the propulsion system must operate over a large range of 
thrusts which is inherently inefficient, and the structural mass savings (initially thought to be 
considerable) is minimal.

Cost per Image 

Cost Distribution vs. Interferometer Type 
–  Cost appears to scale with mass 
and complexity, favoring the SCI 
architectures 
– There is  no substantial cost 
difference between 1-dimensional 
and 2-dimensional architectures. 

Cost per Image vs. Interferometer Type 
–  The SCI 1-Dimensional architecture 
has a high imaging rate and is 
reasonably cheap, so it produces 
the “best” combined performance. 
–  This “best” architecture will likely 
change as the design vector 
changes.

Cost Distribution vs. Interferometer Type 
The cost distribution appears to scale with mass and complexity, so the SSI 
architecture is duly penalized.  The largest increases in cost come with extra 
development cost (presumably due to complexity) and with extra bus cost (due to 
the increase in bus mass).  The net difference in mass between the SCI and SSI 
architectures is small enough, though, that there is negligible launch vehicle 
penalty.  As mass increases, we are sure to a see a launch vehicle effect on the 
interferometer trade. 

Cost per Function vs. Interferometer Type 
The cost per function is a combined metric attempting to capture both the 
performance and the cost we pay for that performance.  In this case, the one-
dimensional SCI architecture has the “best” cost per function.  This is quite obvious 
because the one-dimensional SCI case matches the performance of the one-
dimensional SSI case for the cost of the two-dimensional SCI case.  The “best” 
architecture will likely change as the design vector changes.  It is difficult to project 
the changes of the cost per function, because it incorporates both image distribution 
and cost (mass and complexity) effects.  Please review the former sections to 
estimate these changes.

•The payload cost increases as D2.67 
•The operations/development cost is independent of aperture size, 
and is higher in the case of separated spacecraft, 
because of the increased system complexity; 
•The bus cost is higher for the separated spacecraft case, 
as it scales with the number of independent spacecraft; 
•Launch cost are approximately equal in the two cases. 

46 

Trade Study: Aperture Diameter 
We want to analyze the effect in the system performance and cost due to variations in the aperture 
diameter, keeping all the other design variables fixed.

As a first step, we analyze the effects on the overall cost, and on the cost components, due to the  

variation in aperture size.

First of all, we notice, as expected, that the payload cost increases as the aperture size increases. The  

payload cost can be split into a fixed component and a component that varies with the mirror size.  

This variable component is proportional to the aperture diameter to the 2.67.

The operations/development cost is largely independent of the aperture size, and it is indeed constant

in the above plots. Moreover, we notice that this cost component is considerably bigger in the SSI

case, due to the increased complexity of the SSI system over the SCI.

The bus costs are higher in the SSI case, since we have to duplicate components for each and every  

one of the independent spacecraft, and increase with the aperture size, since bigger mirrors require 

more capabilities from the bus (e.g. thermal system). The SSI and SCI bus costs can be seen to differ  

by a constant term.

Finally, the launch costs are essentially the same for the two cases. However, we notice that for  

D=4m in the SSI case, we have a jump in the launch cost. This is due to the fact that the total system

mass exceeds the capabilities of the previously selected launcher, and requires a more expensive  

launch system.

As a consequence of the above trends, the total costs in both the SSI and SCI cases grow more than  

quadratically with the aperture size. The cost difference, on the other hand, appears to be constant,

and is due mainly to the cost difference in the operations/development, and secondarily to different

bus costs.

The increased collection area allows for a bigger harvest of photons from the target; 
as a consequence, the integration times required for each image will be reduced 
accordingly. Since we are considering a constant time delay between observation, it 
can be easily seen that as the aperture diameter grows, the total number of images 
per unit time goes to some asymptotic value. This effect is the same for both SSI 
and SCI cases. 
The cost per image shows a generally decreasing behavior in the range we have 
considered, showing optimum values at the right end of the plot. The SSI case 
presents a very slight minimum at 3.5m, due to the increase in the launch cost for 
d=4m discussed in the previuos slide. Since the total cost increases as D^2.67, while 
the total number of images approaches a constant value, the cost per image will 
eventually increase at the same rate as the total cost. This means that the cost per 
image will have some minimum value, that form the plot above appears to be close 
to 4m. On the other hand, the cost difference approaches a constant value, as it will 
eventually be the ratio of two constants. 

On the very limited trade space analyzed here, it appears that an SCI architecture 
with D=4m would be the optimum with respect to the aperture size.

Summary of Trade Studies (Orbit, Number of Apertures) 

This slide summarizes the key relationships discovered from the trade studies of 
orbit and number of apertures. 

Orbit: 

Generally, the total number of images, mass, and cost increase as orbit 
increases.  The number of images reaches the maximum of about 1200 images after 
about 3 AU because the effect of the local zodiacal dust becomes small.  Therefore, 
orbit does not influence the number of images any more.  The same number of 
images are expected for both SSI and SCI with the same number of aperture and 
size of aperture.  SSI in general will have higher mass and cost.  Since the total 
number of images is the same for both SSI and SCI, the ratio of total cost over the 
number images, cost per image, is lower for SCI.  The lowest cost per image is 
when orbit is 2.5 AU for SCI.  Unfortunately, 2.5 AU is located in the asteroid belt, 
so future work is required to see if this orbit is feasible for TPF. 

Number of Aperture: 
Total number of images, mass, and cost increase as the number of apertures 
increases.  SSI produces more images than SCI except when number of aperture is 
4.  This trade study shows that the total mass, cost, and cost per image is higher for 
SSI than SCI.  The lowest cost per image for both SCI and SSI happens when 
number of aperture is  8.

Summary of Trade Studies (Size of Aperture, Interferometer Type) 

This slide summarizes the key relationships discovered from the trade studies of size 
of aperture and interferometer type. 

Size of Aperture: 
As the aperture diameter increases, the total number of images, and total cost 
increase.  Total cost increases as diameter^2.67 and total number of images 
increases until it meets its asymptotic value.  The total number of images for both 
SSI and SCI are the same for the same aperture diameter.  The lowest cost per 
image is when the aperture diameter is 3.5 m for SSI and 4 m for SCI.  Since the 
total number of image reaches constant after 4 m and the cost increases as the size 
of aperture increases, the ratio of these two, the cost per image, will start to increase 
after 4 m. 

Interferometer Type: 
The trade study of Interferometer type vs. outputs shows that cost and mass 
of SSI are generally higher than SCI.  1D has higher imaging rate than 2D for both 
SSI and SCI.  Combining these two trends produces a result that SCI 1D generates 
the lowest cost per image.

Operational Trade Results 
The previous trades presented in the preceding few slides 
varied one of the four parameters in the design vector to 
determine the effect of that parameter on the total system. 
Eventually, we wish to fill in our entire trade space by 
varying several parameters to arrive at an optimal 
solution for a chosen system metric.  The operations trade 
study captures the dynamics of the operational 
component while several variables are changed.  Since 
operations cost and operationally-derived performance 
losses have such a large impact on total mission cost and 
performance, it behooves the mission designer to 
understand the coupling of operations with the other 
design vectors. 
Crew Sizes vs. Time 
Different staffing levels will be required at different 
times during the mission.  The graph in the upper right 
corner shows the effect of time on the crew levels of four 
different configurations.  The increase in complexity 
between the SCI and more complex SSI types increases 
the crew levels, despite learning curve effects of 
operating more similar spacecraft. Increasing the distance 
at which the TPF operates (e.g from 1 to 5 AU) would 
tend to increase the transit time and cost. 

Ops Cost Breakdown 
In the graph in the lower right corner we witness the 
effect of increasing mission complexity on two different 
components of operational cost.  Notice the large jump 
in yearly maintenance between the SCI and the least 
complex SSI.  This represents the difficulty from 
switching from a single satellite ops scenario to a 
constellation and the attendant increase in control center 
size and capability.  Also notice that further increases in 
complexity to 8 and 12 aperture SSI configurations have 
only a marginal effect on yearly maintenance.  Labor 
costs increase relatively linearly between the 
architectures shown.  Steady-state maintenance and 
labor costs are relatively independent of final orbit. 
Mission Inefficiency vs. Orbit 
The graph in the lower left corner shows the increase in 
mission inefficiency with orbit for three system 
configurations.  The SCI closest to earth has the least 
inefficiency while the most complex SSI farthest away 
has the most.  Notice also that the rate of inefficiency 
increase is greatest for the SSI with 8 collector 
spacecraft.

Best Cost Per Image Performance 
From  the  25  different  cases  that  we  ran  to  determine  the  different  trends,  the  best 
cost  per  image  performance  by  a  Separated  Spacecraft  Interferometer  design  is  to 
operate a linearly symmetric interferometer using 8 apertures at 1 AU distance from 
the  sun.  This  result  is  different  to  the Structurally Connected  Interferometer where 
the  best  performance  there  occurs  when  operating  orbit  of  the  interferometer  is 
varied from the baseline case. 
Note  that  the  best  design  shown  here  is  by  no  means  the  optimal  design  since  we 
have only sampled a very small portion of the trade space.  The key objective of this 
result  indicates  the  capability  of  our  methodology  to  determine  the  “best”  solution 
using the assumptions we have made

This chart presents the best case from the previous trade studies (25  cases) when 
only one parameter is varied at the same time. We see that the largest benefit seems 
to come form going out to 2.5 AU. This effect leads to a shorter integration time for 
a  given SNR  due to the reduced local zodiacal noise. This in turn leads to a larger 
number of images over the lifetime. 

It is interesting to compare this architecture with the previous SSI case. We see that 
it provides significantly better cost/image performance . In general it is a very 
different mission than the SSI mission. The total system mass is about half of the 
SSI case and launch vehicle costs, system complexity (optics design, ADCS design) 
is much simpler. Even though the $/image performance is better the versatility of 
the instrument (especially if we were to include astrophysical imaging) is also lower 
than in the SSI case.

Is this the best case ? 
Provides the lowest $/image of all cases we ran but 
it is WRONG to claim that this is the absolute best , 
since we have not fully explored the trade space 

54 

This case results from taking the local minima in the (one-dimensional) trade 
studies and using them to create a combined case for the SCI. We can see that 
the resulting cost/image is indeed the lowest for all of the cases we ran. It would 
however be WRONG to claim that this is the absolutely best architecture since 
we have not conducted an exhaustive search of the trade space. 

Our recommendation for the future is to refine and validate the methodology, 
conduct sensitivity analysis and to search the ENTIRE trade space to find the 
globally best architecture.

Even though SSI consistently has greater $/image it 
provides greater flexibility, which is not captured in 
the current model.

Even though the mass is very large for this architecture, this could be split 

into several launch vehicles since we are in the SSI case. Also here it is not 

correct to claim that this is the best architecture since we have not 

performed an exhaustive search of the trade space.

List of Deliverables 

This slide shows the list of deliverables generated throughout all the design 
phases.  During each presentation (TARR, PDR, and CDR), printed slides with 
annotation were generated.  Initial of the contributors was added on each annotation. 
Requirements Document was initially generated during the Conceptual 
Design Phase and went through continuous revision and updates during other design 
phases.  The final version of the Requirements Document is in electronic version. 
The Architecture Analysis Document is the detailed final report that will be 
turned in after the CDR.  It includes project overview, the TPF mission description, 
architectural design approach, architectural design options, architectural design 
evaluation modules, architectural design evaluation results, and conclusion.  It also 
include the copy of TMAS as an appendix.  The Report Team, consists of André 
Girerd, Emilio Frazzoli, and Andrew Curtis, is leading in collecting sections from 
each member and integrating them to a final report. 
Finally, a journal article will be written to summarize the class effort and 
published in a journal.

Future Work 
This slide summarizes the areas that we were not able to incorporate into our model due to the time 
limit and therefore recommended as future work.  For the integration and analysis of model, full trade 
space analysis is required in order to find out the best architecture.  The team was only able to carry out 
the single point trade studies, in which one of the design vector was varied at a time to see its relationship 
with the outputs.  This kind of trade study suggests the key relationships and general trends, but does not 
give the best optimal solution.  Although our software is already complex, increasing fidelity to the 
modules will give more accurate solution.  Many of the failure rates were assumed because we did not 
have enough information.  Adding more reliability data to the model will result in more confident analysis 
and trade studies of architectures.  Many of the modules were generated using current resources and 
technology.  If we include some of the future technology that will be ready for TPF, it will cut down the 
cost as well as the development time. 
For the orbit transfer, the orbit module was based on the Hohmann’s and Hill’s transfer only.  For 
future work, adding gravity assist or the low thrust electric propulsion to the orbit module will cut down 
the delta V requirement and therefore cut down the launch cost.  For the launch vehicle module, only a 
single launch vehicle was considered for both SSI and SCI.  For SSI, multiple smaller launch vehicles can 
be used.  For future work, the module can incorporate an option of using multiple launch vehicle if it cuts 
down the cost. 
For SSI case, only circular trajectory was considered for image maneuvering for simpler 
calculations.  If we use other trajectories such as drift mode, propulsion can be saved and the cost will be 
decreased as a result.  For designing and integrating the bus module, more efficient optimization algorithm 
will help to reduce the complexity of the bus module and provide a better optimized bus design.  For the 
operation, optimizing the automation level was recommended as a possible future work.  Finally, adding 
astrophysical image capability to the model as well as detection and spectroscopy capability was 
recommended as a future work.

Lessons Learned 

This slide summarizes lessons learned during our entire design phases.  The 
most important lesson learned is the fact that the team had to compromise between 
model fidelity  vs. simulation time.  Balancing the complexity of analysis model and 
the limited time became an important issue throughout the entire program. 
Especially in the trade studies, we only had an opportunity to perform single axis 
trade studies, in which we varied one design vector at a time to see how output 
changes.  Although the team wanted to perform full trade space analysis initially, 
we realized that there was not a enough time to finish the full trade space analysis. 
The next lesson the team learned is how the design phase works.  During our 
Conceptual Design Phase, we considered many different architecture options 
including celestial body, tethered, hybrid,  SCI, and SSI.  During later design 
phases, we narrowed those down to only SCI and SSI and carried out through the 
Critical Design Phase. 
Interface and Configuration Control using N2 diagram proved that it is 
extremely important when we create a large software such as TMAS.  It defines 
inputs and outputs, and ensures all the modules are linked properly. 
By doing the trade studies at the end, we were able to see the general trends 
and relationships between each design vector and the corresponding outputs.  Using 
these key relationships, more detailed trade studies can be performed in the future. 
Through the program, everyone learned how to participate in a team project, 
had an opportunity to present slides, and write reports.  We learned these key 
elements of systems engineering, the way 16.89 course was intended.
