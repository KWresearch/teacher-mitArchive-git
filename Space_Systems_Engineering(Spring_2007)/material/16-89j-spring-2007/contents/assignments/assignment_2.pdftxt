Assignment 2 
 
 
In this assignment you will map out the key relationships between angular resolution, 
signal to noise ratio and system cost for a telescope with a circular monolithic aperture at 
three wavelengths: radio frequency, infrared and visual. The purpose of this exercise is 
for you to obtain a better understanding the relationships between key aspects of the 
problem such as imaging performance in terms of isolation and sensitivity, system mass, 
system cost and location.

You can solve this assignment in teams of two. When uploading your answer, upload a 
Word or Latex file with your report and a zip file with all your calculations. You may 
choose whatever tool suits you best (Matlab, Excel, Mathematica …).

1.  What are the key relationships? 
 

a.  Assemble the main equations that capture the angular resolution, signal to 
noise ratio, telescope mass, acquisition cost, transportation costs and 
observation time. List these equations in your report along with the 
nomenclature you have chosen to use. Cite your sources. 

 
b.  Show the relationships between these equations in a block diagram or in 
an N2 diagram (or DSM) 

c.  Write about ~1-2 pages of narrative to explain your quantitative and 
qualitative understanding of these relationships.

2.  Imaging Performance versus system cost 1? 
 

a.  Create the following three plots: 
i.  angular resolution [deg] versus system cost [$] for a fixed SNR=10 
for a radio telescope (at λRF) located at the Earth’s surface, in LEO, 
at the ESL2 and at the lunar surface2  
ii.  angular resolution [deg] versus system cost [$] for a fixed SNR=10 
for an infrared telescope (at λIR) located at the Earth’s surface, in 
LEO, at the ESL2 and at the lunar surface 3  
iii.  angular resolution [deg] versus system cost [$] for a fixed SNR=10 
for a visual telescope (at λVis) located at the Earth’s surface, in 
LEO, at the ESL2 and at the lunar surface 4  

 
b.  In each of the three plots add at least one telescope that was analyzed in 
assignment 1 and discuss its position. Is the position realistic? (e.g. HST 
should fall near the “LEO-IR” and “LEO-Vis” lines in the respective 
plots). 

 
c.  Write ~ 1-2 pages to discuss the plots, e.g. if there are any crossovers 
between the lines and so forth. What is the overriding conclusion from this 
analysis? 

3.  Other considerations 
a.  Write ~ 1 page on other considerations that would need to be included in a 
more comprehensive analysis. In particular, given the exposure time t, to 
achieve an SNR of 10, and taking into account the location of the 
telescope, how many observations of the reference target star could be 
made per year for each telescope? 
b.  What have you learned from this exercise? 

 

 
 
 

                                                 
1 System cost should include the construction and transportation costs of the telescope, but not its 
operations costs, use FY2010 dollars 
2 There should be four lines on this plot, one for each location 
3 There should be four lines on this plot, one for each location 
4 There should be four lines on this plot, one for each location
