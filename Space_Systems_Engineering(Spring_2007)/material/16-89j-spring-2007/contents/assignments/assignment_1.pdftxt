Assignment #1: Existing Designs for Major

Astronomical Telescopes 


16.89 Spring 2007 

This assignment asks you to assemble key information about an existing design of a major 
astronomical telescope. From your research, and the results collected by the class, we hope 
you will become familiar with the key drivers and trade-offs in telescope design, and with 
some real-world examples that may help guide your thinking during the 16.89 project. 

You will be assigned  to study one of  the following major Earth-based or space-based tele­
scope designs. These designs have been studied, developed, and/or built during the past few 
decades  for  (primarily)  deep  space  observations  in  the  visible,  infrared,  and  radio  wave­
lengths.  We  have  excluded  shorter  wavelengths  (X-ray,  gamma  ray)  since  these  present 
substantially different challenges for telescope design.

For the design assigned to you, we ask you to compile a 2-page report providing information 
(with numbers) on the following elements of the design. Make a reasonable effort given the 
availability of information for your design—rough data is better than no data, but you should 
indicate  the  reliability of  the  data  you  present.  Please  be  sure  to  cite  your  sources  so  that 
we can compile them for future reference.
