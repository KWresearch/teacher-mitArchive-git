ESD.33 Systems Engineering  
 
HW 2 -- Frameworks 
 
Due Date: 17 June, 8:30AM EST 
 
Deliverable: Team written assignment (about four pages per team).   
 
Time allotment: You should expect to spend 5 hours on this homework. 
 
Grading:  5% of your course grade.  Every team member earns the same grade. 
 
Objectives: 
This  assignment  is  primarily  aligned  with  the  first  two  objectives  of  the  course  –  the 
ability to plan the SE process and to judge the applicability of processes. 
 
Assignment: 
Self  select  into  teams  of  2  to  4  people.    It will  be  best  for  you  to  form  teams within  a 
single company or perhaps a single industry.  
 
1.  Don  Clausing  articulated  a  framework  in  which  Requirements,  Concepts,  and 
Improvement  (RCI)  are  the  backbone  of  Systems  Engineering.    To  explore  this 
framework, please do the following:

a) Select  an  organization  that  develops  products  or  systems  (preferably  choose  an 
organization  that  you  have  worked  for).    State  which  organization  you  selected 
and briefly describe the organization and its products or services. 
b)  Determine  what  tools/processes  the  organization  actually  employs  (if  any)  to 
deal with each aspect of systems engineering  (R, C, &  I).    Ideally, you can show 
some  graphics  from  their  documented  product  development  process  or  training 
materials.    An  example  of  such  a  graphic  (from  the  Ford  Motor  Company)  is 
shown to the right. Comment on the effectiveness of each process based on your 
personal experience. 
c) Excellent  performance  in  product  development  is  often  catalyzed  by  technical 
leaders who ask good questions.   Select an  example  system at  the organization 
you  have  chosen.    Imagine  a  design  review  for  that  system  (which  phase  of 
review  is your choice).  Write a typical question that a project  leader might ask at 
a  design  review  and  then  propose  an  even  better  question  on  the  same  topic.  
Try  to develop  such a pair of questions  (typical question  / better question)  for all 
three key aspects of Systems Engineering that Clausing emphasized (RCI).

2.  A key aspect of lean thinking is “value stream mapping.”   

 

 

a) Select any value creating process of moderate complexity and sketch  its value 
stream  map.    You  don’t  need  to  use  any  specialized  symbology.    Just  represent 
processes  and  flows  in  some  easily  comprehensible  way.    An  example  from 
Womak’s Lean Thinking is depicted below. 

b) Describe at least one example of “muda” within the value stream.

3.  Ward used the simple example of scheduling a meeting to demonstrate the 
benefits of a set-based approach.  Find another task from engineering, business, or 
everyday life and describe how a set-based approach can be used to carry out the 
task.  Explain, using this example, how the set-based process results in good or bad 
outcomes (as the specific case dictates).
