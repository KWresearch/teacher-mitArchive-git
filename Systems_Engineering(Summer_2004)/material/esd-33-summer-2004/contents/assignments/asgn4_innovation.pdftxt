ESD.33 Systems Engineering  
Assignment 4 
Innovation 

 

 

 
Due Date: 6 July, 8:30AM EST 
 
Deliverable: Team written report (about five pages) 
 
Time allotment: You should expect to spend 5 hours all together on this homework. 
 
Grading: 5% of your final course grade.  Every team member earns the same grade. 
 
Objectives: 
This  assignment  is  primarily  aligned  with  the  objectives–  “apply  the  most  essential 
systems engineering tools” and “gathering and using data...” 
 
Assignment: 
Self  select  into  teams  of  3  to  5  people.    In  this  case,  I  think  it  is  best  to  create  a  team 
from a single company or industry.  
 
1) Summary of this week’s major concepts: 
a.  List  and  summarize  the  most  essential  new  concepts  (roughly  five  concepts) 
introduced in session #7 – Pugh Concept Selection.   
b.  List  and  summarize  the  most  essential  new  concepts  (roughly  five  concepts) 
introduced in session #8 – Effective Innovation.   

 
2) Select a system of interest to you (or a subsystem thereof) and evaluate aspects of its 
technical  evolution  over  a  period  of  about  ten  to  fifty  years.    Preferably,  the  evolution 
should be documented with text and graphics from publicly available documents such as 
patents.  Please include the following elements if possible: 
a.  Provide an example of a launch innovation 
 
b.  Provide an example of a sequence of about three growth innovations 
 
 
c.  Attempt to forecast a growth innovation that has yet to come    
 
3) Write  a  short  essay  (about  500 words)  evaluating  TRIZ  as  a  systems  engineering  tool.   You 
may  wish  to  address  the  following  questions.    What  is  TRIZ  good  for?    What  is  TRIZ  not  so 
good  for?    What  challenges  exist  in  introducing  TRIZ  to  an  organization?    What  are  the  most 
important  alternative  tools  that  address  the  same  or  similar  needs?   What  do  you  recommend 
doing in your company or industry to promote effective innovation?
