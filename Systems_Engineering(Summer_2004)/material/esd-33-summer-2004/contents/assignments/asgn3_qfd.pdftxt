 

ESD.33 Systems Engineering  
Assignment 3 
Quality Function Deployment 
 
Due Date: 29 June, 8:30AM EST 
 
Deliverable: Team written report (about five pages) 
 
Time allotment: You should expect to spend 5 hours all together on this homework. 
 
Grading: 5% of your final course grade.  Every team member earns the same grade. 
 
Objectives: 
This  assignment  is  primarily  aligned  with  the  third  objective  of  the  course  –  “apply  the 
most  essential  systems  engineering  tools”  but  it  also  helps  to  sharpen  your  ability  to 
“judge  the  applicability  of  any  proposed  process,  strategy,  or  methodology  for  systems 
engineering using the fundamental concepts from disciplines such as of probability...” 
 
Assignment: 
Self  select  into  teams  of  3  to  5  people.    In  this  case,  I  think  it  is  best  to  create  a 
heterogeneous  team  since  QFD  will  normally  be  practiced  with  large,  multi-disciplinary 
groups.  
 
1)  Select  a  system  of  interest  to  you  (or  a  subsystem  thereof)  and  develop  a  House  of 
Quality  (HoQ)  for  it.    Provide  a  similar  level  of  detail  as  in  Exhibit  X  (see  below)  of 
Hauser and Clausing  (about 10  customer attributes and 10 engineering characteristics).  
Provide  some  supporting  text  or  annotations  to  explain  the HoQ.    For  example,  you will 
need to explain what the system is and who the customers are.

              A complete HoQ.
(Adapted from Hauser and Clausing.)

 
 2)  Take  a  small  subset  (about  2  by  2)  of  the  House  of  Quality  you  developed  in  part  1  and 
create  at 
to 
the  customer  attributes 
flowing  down 
linked  houses 
three  small, 
least 
manufacturing,  maintenance,  operations,  or  whatever  downstream  considerations  are 
appropriate to the system.  Your figure will be akin to Hauser and Clausing Exhibit XI.

3)  Write  a  short  essay  (about  500  words)  comparing  QFD  with  an  alternative  approach  to 
requirements  development  and  analysis.    Ideally,  the  alternative  should  be  one  with  which  you 
have  direct  experience..  If  you  do  not  have  such  an  experience,  study  an  alternative  to  QFD 
(preferably  choose  a method  for  which  you  can  find  data  or  theory  to  support  it  effectiveness).  
What do you recommend for use in your industry?
