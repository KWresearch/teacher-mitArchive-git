ESD.33 Systems Engineering  
Assignment 5 
Error Budgeting 

 
Due Date: 13 July, 8:30AM EST 
 
Deliverable: Team written report (about five pages) 
 
Time allotment: You should expect to spend 5 hours all together on this homework. 
 
Grading: 5% of your final course grade.  Every team member earns the same grade. 
 
 
Assignment: 
Self  select  into  teams  of  2  to  3  people.    In  this  case,  I  think  it  is  best  to  have  a 
heterogeneous team.  
 
1) Short answer questions 
 

a.  The  collapsible  umbrella  is  a  solution  to  a  practical  problem.    State  the 
problem it solves as a contradiction (as is the suggested approach in TRIZ). 

   
b. A  fluidized bed  (as depicted  to  the  right)  is  composed 
of  solid  particles,  but  the  ensemble  of  particles  in  the 
“fluidized  zone”  flows  like  a  liquid.    What  type  of 
resolution  of  a  system  conflict  does  this  represent 
according to TRIZ?  

 
c.   You  roll a  set of  three dice  (the usual  six  sided  kind).  
What  is  the expected value of  the  total value showing 
on  the  three  dice?    What  is  the  probability  of 
observing a total equal to the expected value?   

 
d.   You  roll a set of  three dice  (the usual six sided kind).  
The standard deviation of any one die is 1.708.  What 
is the standard deviation of the total value showing on 
the three dice?

2)  The  document  Frey_Error  Budgeting.pdf  describes  an  error  budget  for  a  SCARA 
robot.    This  series  of  questions  is  related  to  the  machine  including  its  kinematic  model 
and the list of error sources (above). 
 
a.    The  robot  is  used  to  apply  thermally  conductive  adhesive  to  a  printed  wiring  board. 
The  board’s  surface  is  at  z=100mm.  The  adhesive  nozzle  has  to  be  placed  above  the 
surface by 1±0.1mm.   Approximate  the process capability  (Cpk)  for  this  task when  joint 2

)  and  the  adhesive  nozzle  has  been  lowered  to 
is  rotated  modestly  (

the  nominally  correct  height  (Z=659mm).    For  part  (a)  you  may  assume  the  simplified

b.    The  solution  to  the  problem  above  should  indicate  there  is  a  significant  bias  (k≠0).  
Suggest  a  procedure  to  reduce  the  bias  in  the  process.    Your  procedure  should  not 
make turnover of the robot between different tasks more difficult.  Your procedure should 
preferably  work  even  if  the  adhesive  must  be  applied  at  different  points  in  the  working 
volume of the robot. 
 
c.    The  robot  is  to  be  used  to  locate  a  test  probe  at  x=700±0.25mm  and  y=50±0.25mm.  
You  should  be  able  to  verify  that  this will  require,  nominally,  that  the  inputs  to  the  robot

are 
,  and  Z=560mm.    You  can  assume  all 
,

the bias  in  the error has been eliminated by  you process  in part  (b). Determine whether 
the  x  and  y  positions  of  the  probe  are  correlated.    Estimate  the  probability  that  the 
tolerance  on  x  position  is  satisfied.    Estimate  the  probability  that  the  tolerance  on  y 
position is satisfied. Approximate the yield of this process (the fraction of the instances in 
which the probe will be placed simultaneously satisfying both x and y tolerances). 
 
NOTE:    The  folder  on  Sloanspace  has  Matlab  files  that  essentially  solve  this  problem.  
They  are  named  “tip.m”  and  “probsim.m”.    If  you  download  them  both  to  a  folder,  set 
your  path  to  include  the  folder,  and  type  “probsim”  a  graph  will  appear  from  which  the 
answers  should be  clear.   These  files are  there  is  case  you get  stuck.    If  you use  them, 
say so in your homework and you will still get partial credit (most of the credit) as long as 
your discussion and analysis are strong. 
 
d.    Comment  on  the  answers  to  part  (c)  from  the  perspective  of  Suh’s  theory  of 
Axiomatic  Design.    Does  the  information  content  of  the  FRs  sum?    Is  the  design 
coupled?    Would  you  suggest  any  changes  to  the  design  on  the  basis  of  these 
observations?
