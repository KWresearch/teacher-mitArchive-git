Session #4
Axiomatic Design
Decision-Based Design
Summary of Frameworks Phase

Dan Frey

Follow-up on Session #3

• Mike Fedor - Your lectures and readings 
about Lean Thinking have motivated me to 
re-read "The Goal" by Eliyahu M. Goldratt
• Don Clausing – Remember that although 
set-based design seems to explain part of 
Toyota’s system, it also includes a suite of 
other powerful tools (QFD, Robust Design)
• Denny Mahoney – What assumptions are 
you making about Ops Mgmt?

Plan for the Session
• Why are we doing this session?
• Axiomatic Design (Suh)
• Decision-Based Design (Hazelrigg)
• What is rationality?
• Overview of frameworks 
• Discussion of Exam #1 / Next steps

Claims Made by Nam Suh
• “A general theory for system design is presented”
• “The theory is applicable to … large systems, 
software systems, organizations…”
• “The flow diagram … can be used for many 
different tasks: design, construction, operation, 
modification, … maintenance … diagnosis …, and 
for archival documentation.”
• “Design axioms were found to improve all designs 
without exceptions or counter-examples… When 
counter-examples or exceptions are proposed, the 
author always found flaws in the arguments.”

Claims Made by Hazelrigg
“We present here … axioms and … theorems that underlie 
the mathematics of design”
“substantially different from … conventional … eng design”
“imposes severe conditions on upon design methodologies”
“all other measures are wrong”
“apply to … all fields of engineering … all products, 
processes, and services, and also for the management of 
engineering design, …and the integration of engineering 
design with … the entire product life cycle …
“without the axiomatic framework … there will be an 
attendant loss .. typically a factor of two or more in the 
bottom line”

Falsifiability
• The criterion of demarcation of empirical 
science from pseudo science and 
metaphysics is falsifiability.
• The strength of a theory can be measured 
by the breadth of experimental results that 
it precludes
– Sir Karl Popper (1902-1994), Logik der Forschung

What are Axioms?
• “Primitive propositions whose truth is known 
immediately without the use of deduction” 
- Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy
• “A statement that is stipulated to be true for the 
purpose of constructing a theory”           
- Harper Collins Dictionary of Mathematics
• “Fundamental truths that are always observed 
to be valid and for which there are no 
counterexamples or exceptions”              
- Suh, The Principles of Design
“Axioms are posited as accepted truths, and a 
system of logic is built around them”
– Hazelrigg, “An Axiomatic Framework for Engineering Design”

Benefit of Separate Domains
• Customer Needs are stated in the customer’s 
language
• Functional Requirements and Constraints are 
determined to satisfy Customer Needs 
• “The FRs must be determined in a solution 
neutral environment” (or, in other words, say 
“what” not “how”)
– BAD = the adhesive should not peel
– BETTER = the attachment should hold under the 
following loading conditions
• Keeping FRs in solution neutral terms prevents 
inadvertent “lock in” to specific modes of solution

Suh’s Design Axioms

• The Independence Axiom 
– Maintain the independence of the 
functional requirements.
• The Information Axiom
– Minimize the information content.

Chris Lutz

• During an NPR program last year, they 
were discussing that there exists a strong 
cultural bias in favor of separate hot and 
cold water faucets in Britain even though a 
good single Moen design (and now others) 
exists.  
• Even though a design is superior (based 
on the axioms), it may fail in the 
marketplace.  How do you address this? 

Functional Coupling
vs Physical Coupling

• Just because a single physical entity carries 
out multiple functions it does not imply 
functional coupling!

Benefits of Uncoupling
• Simpler operation
• More transparent design
• Simpler to change the design
• More parallelism in the design process

The Supposedly Dire 
Consequences of Coupling
• “.. when several functional requirements must be 
satisfied, designers must develop designs that 
have a diagonal or triangular matrix”
• “For a product to be manufacturable, the design 
matrix of a product, [A] … times the design 
matrix for the manufacturing process, [B] … 
must yield either a diagonal or triangular matrix.  
Consequently, when … either [A] or [B] 
represents a coupled design, the product cannot 
be manufactured.” Theorem 9 (Design for 
Manufacturability)

My Conclusions
• Uncoupled or decoupled alternatives are not 
always available
• Coupled designs can be executed successfully
• Simulation is helps us execute coupled designs
Suh’s Conclusions
• If a design is coupled, FRs can only be satisfied 
when there is a unique solution
• If a fully coupled design is acceptable, it is 
equivalent to having only one independent FR
• FRs are defined as the minimum set of 
independent requirements

Summing Information

Theorem  13  (Information  Content  of  the  Total  System)
–  If  each  FR  is  probabilistically  independent  of  other  FRs,
the  information  content  of  the  total  system  is  the  sum  of
information  of  all  individual  events  associated  with  the  set
Suh [1990]
of FRs that must be satisfied.

Information Cannot be Summed 
for Decoupled Designs
the  design  matrix  A 
Proposition  –  If 
is
decoupled  and  the  DPs  are  probabilistically
independent  with  non-zero  variance  and  the  on-
diagonal  elements  of  A  are  non-zero,  then  the
FRs  CANNOT  be  probabilistically  independent
and the information content cannot be summed.

Content of Decoupled Designs," Research in Engineering Design, 12(2): 90-102.

Coupling and Information
Conclusions
• The information content of decoupled 
designs can sometimes be significantly 
different from the sum of information of 
the FRs
• These differences can sometimes 
critically affect engineering decision 
making
• In some cases, the Information Axiom 
requires that decoupled designs are to be 
preferred to uncoupled designs

Plan for the Session
• Why are we doing this session?
• Axiomatic Design (Suh)
• Decision-Based Design (Hazelrigg)
• What is rationality?
• Overview of frameworks 
• Discussion of Exam #1 / Next steps

Decision Based Design

• Engineering design is a decision making 
process in which the designer must, in 
the presence of uncertainty, make 
choices among alternatives 
• Decision making has an axiomatic basis 
in vN-M utility theory etc.
• Designers should try to maximize E(u)

Hazelrigg, G.A., 1999, “An Axiomatic Framework for Engineering Design,” ASME Journal of Mechanical Design, 121, pp. 342-347.

Definitions

• Decision – a choice among alternatives, an 
irrevocable allocation of resources
• Outcome – the result of a decision
• Expectation – One’s knowledge about the 
outcome prior to making a decision
• Uncertainty – a lack of precise knowledge
• Risk – The result of uncertainty on the outcome 
of a decision
• Information – The basis on which good 
decisions are made

The Axioms of DBD

• Axioms 1-7 are von Neumann and 
Morgenstern’s 
• Axiom 8 – All engineering designs are 
selected from among the set of designs that 
are explicitly considered.

• Basically, Axiom 8 says that Axioms 1-7 
apply to engineering design decisions

Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem

There is no way of consistently 
aggregating the preferences of more than 
two individuals if
• Collective ordering scheme is applied uniformly
• A preference shared by all must be reflected in the 
collective preference
• Independence from irrelevant alternatives
• No individual has dictatorial power

Kenneth Arrow, Nobel Prize in Economics, 1972

Preferences and Pie

• You are presented with two pies
– Banana Cream and Cherry
– You select Banana Cream
• You are presented with two pies
– Apple and Banana Cream
– You select Apple
• You are presented with two pies
– Cherry and Apple
– You select Cherry

Is there anything problematic RE: this situation?

Intransitivity of Preferences

The preference ordering
A>B>C>A
Implies an ordering of utilities
U(A)>U(B)>U(C)>U(A)
Intransitive preferences 
– Allow a Dutch bet to be formed
– Are considered by many to be “irrational”

Hazelrigg’s Claims 

• Arrow’s theorem implies that 
– “irrationality is practically assured”
– “a customer-centered view of design is not 
possible”
• The majority of methods in common use in 
engineering design provide results that are 
“egregiously in error”
• Adopting his approach leads to a factor of 
two improvement in the bottom line

Utility and Choice

• “Some common misperceptions about 
utility are:
• …The test of utilities is to see if they result 
in reasonable choices.  It is common for 
engineers to test utility functions by 
examination of the resonableness of 
choices.  The reality is that utilities need to 
be tested against preferences, not 
choices.”

• Estimate the number of M&Ms in a jar
• Whoever is closest without going over wins
“Conventional” approach
•
– Create a model
– Submit your best estimate
“Rational” approach
– Create a model
– Propagate uncertainty
– Model the competitive scenario
– Select guess for max E(u)

Benefits of Decision Theory
• Emphasizes the role of uncertainty in 
engineering design
• Shows that resolution among 
alternatives is an important criteria for 
handling uncertainty
• Brings in the influence of competitors
on our designs
• Aligns decisions with “the goal” of 
engineering design (profit?)
• Preferences are of the decision maker

Suh, Hazelrigg and Rationality

•

•

•

•

“Some people use dimensional analysis, decision 
theory (etc)…. They do not provide tools for coming up 
with a rational system design”    
- Suh, Axiomatic Design Theory for Systems
“Axiomatic design can lead to a rational design …”    
- Suh, “Axiomatic Design Theory for Systems”
“In order to ensure that engineering design is 
conducted as a rational process  …”
– Hazelrigg, “An Axiomatic Framework for Engineering Design”
“…one logically can either accept these results or 
disagree with the axioms.   There is no other rational
choice.”
– Hazelrigg, “An Axiomatic Framework for Engineering Design”

What is Rationality?

•

“No … positive characterization has achieved 
anything close to universal assent … 
Irrationality seems to be the more fundamental 
normative category…” 

- Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy

What is Rationality?
• “Theoretical rationality applies to beliefs … e.g. 
beliefs that are self evident or derived from self 
evident beliefs by a reliable procedure…”
• “Another account of rational action is ... to act 
rationally is to act on universalizable principles, 
so that what is a reason for one person must be 
a reason for everyone…” 
• “Practical rationality applies to actions…acting 
rationally simply means acting in a way that is 
maximally efficient in achieving one’s goals”
- Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy

Human rational behavior is shaped by a 
scissors whose two blades are the structure 
of task environments and the computational 
capabilities of the actor.
- Herbert Simon

Simon, H. A., 1990, “Invariants of human behavior,” 
Annual Review of Psychology, 41, 1-19. 

"Bounded rationality is a genuinely 
interdisciplinary topic.  Its subject matter 
is the mechanisms that humans, 
institutions, and artificial agents use to 
achieve their goals.  The common 
denominator is that decisions need to 
be made with limited time, knowledge, 
and other resources, and in a world that 
is uncertain and changing."

Gigerenzer, G. and R. Selten, 2001, “Rethinking Rationality,” in 
Bounded Rationality, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA. 

“Heuristics that are matched to 
particular environments allow agents to 
be ecologically rational, making 
adaptive decisions that combine 
accuracy with speed and frugality.  We 
call the heuristics “fast and frugal” 
because they process information in a 
relatively simple way, and they search 
for little information."

Todd, P. M., and G. Gigerenzer, 2003, “Bounding Rationality to 
the World,” Journal of Economic Psychology, v. 24, pp. 143-165.

• Axiomatic design
• Decision based design
• “No Silver Bullet”

No Silver Bullet: 
Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering

• The essence of a software entity is a 
construct of interlocking concepts
• I believe the hard part of building software 
to be the specification, design, and testing 
of this conceptual construct
• If this is true, building software will always 
be hard

Promising Attacks on the Essence

• Buy versus build
• Incremental development
• Requirements refinement
• Rapid prototyping
• Great designers

Brooks, Fred, “No Silver Bullet”

Plan For the Session
• Why are we doing this session?
• Axiomatic Design (Suh)
• Decision-Based Design (Hazelrigg)
• What is rationality?
• Overview of frameworks 
• Discussion of Exam #1 / Next steps

Why an Exam?
Why?
• I just hate exams...
• How about we do without the exam and 
instead have a team project assignment…?
Projects = Practice
Exam = Reflection!
• …put less pressure on people to cram and 
emphasize learning.
OK.  Let me suggest how to study.

Exam Logistics
• OPEN BOOK / OPEN EVERYTHING
• Individual effort, you may not discuss with class 
mates or any other human being
• Download the exam from “Exam” folder on 
sloanspace (avail 7:30AM Tues 22 June)
• Do the exam in a single 2 hour sitting
• Do the exam wherever you want
• Upload your file to sloanspace folder 
HOMEWORK/Exam #1

File naming convention -- LastFirst_EX1.doc

Richard Felder’s Guide to Exams

• Test on what you teach
• Consider providing a study guide
• Minimize speed as a factor in performance
• Revise to eliminate flaws
• Design 10-15% of the exam to discriminate 
between A and B level performance

Exam Content
There will be three questions
• Question #1 will be a set of “short answer” 
questions probing basic facts (Bloom 1,2,3) 
about the reading assignments
• Question #2 will ask you to demonstrate working 
knowledge of a major framework (Lean Thinking 
or Set Based Design) to a scenario
• Question #3 will be related to Fred Brooks’ 
paper “No Silver Bullet” – not details but the 
essence and form of his argument as related to 
everything we’ve done so far

Study Guide
• Form a study group (2-8 class mates)
• List every major concept/term used in the 
assigned readings (divide & conquer! use team to 
assemble list)
• Study that list of key concepts
• Develop a few scenarios to which Lean Thinking 
or Set-Based design might be applied and talk 
them through with your group
• Read Fred Brooks’ article “No Silver Bullet”
• Imagine different questions I might pose about 
Brooks’ article and outline different essay 
responses

Next Steps

• Do the reading assignment
– Brooks_No Silver Bullet.pdf
• Study for the exam
• Do the exam 
– 8:30AM Tues 22 June
– Or another time
• Upload the exam to HW folder
