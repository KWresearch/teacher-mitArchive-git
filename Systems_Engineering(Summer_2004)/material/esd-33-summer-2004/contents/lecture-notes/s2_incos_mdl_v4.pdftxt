Systems Engineering
ESD mission: To establish Engineering 
Systems as a field of study focusing on complex 
engineered systems and products viewed in a 
broad human, social and industrial context. Use 
the new knowledge gained to improve 
engineering education and practice.

Discussion Point
• Did the design of the CFM56 jet engine entail a 
systems engineering function?
• Did the design of Whittle’s jet engine entail a 
systems engineering function?

Scott Thomson
Hamilton Sundstrand, Section Lead - Electric Systems

I wanted to comment on the CFM56 vs Whittle engine.  
•
• The CFM56 engine is …an example of the system 
engineering aspects of organizations and their 
architecture/structure and how they relate to the 
partitioning of the engine itself.  The engine being built 
by CFMI, which is a consortium of GE, SNECMA and 
Hispano-Suiza.  No single player builds the entire engine 
… Whittle had his fairly small shop with a collection of 
machinists and his lab - all probably within his domain 
and span of control.  
• One of the other greatly complicating factors of the 
CFM56 vs. Whittle engine are all of the secondary power 
extractions that are powered from today's engines, which 
have an enormous impact on the engine's performance
• SyE makes this possible today; whereas Whittle was 
focused on a revolutionary powerplant for propulsion.

Questions to Probe Chapter 2

According to INCOSE:
• When did SE emerge as a separate 
branch of engineering?
• What are some of the key functions of SE?
• Who should carry out the SE function?
• What fraction of the program budget 
should be spent on SE?
• Do SE methods apply to “smaller” 
systems?

Systems Engineering Process 
According to INCOSE, the basic Systems 
Engineering process tasks are:
1) Define the System Objectives
2) Establish the Functionality
3) Establish the Performance Requirements
4) Evolve Design and Operation Concepts
5) Select a Baseline
6) Verify that the Baseline Meets Requirements
7) Validate that the Baseline Satisfies the User
Iterate the Process through Lower Levels
