Robust Design

• A set of design methods that
– Improve the quality of a product
– Without eliminating the sources of variation 
(noise factors)
– By minimizing sensitivity to noise factors
– Most often through parameter design 

Engineering Tolerances

• Tolerance --The total amount by which a 
specified dimension is permitted to vary
(ANSI Y14.5M)
• Every component
within spec adds
to the yield (Y)

Exploiting Non-linearity
Response

Use your extra 
“degrees of 
freedom” and 
search for robust 
set points.

Control Factor

System Verification Test

• AFTER maximizing robustness
• Make a system prototype
• Get a benchmark (e.g., a good 
competitor’s product)
• Subject BOTH to the same harsh 
conditions

Taguchi’s Quality Imperatives

• Quality losses result from poor design
• Signal to noise ratios should be improved
• Expose your system to noises systematically
• Two step process – reduce variance first 
THEN get on target
• Tolerance design – select processes based 
on total cost (manufacturing cost AND quality)
• Robustness in the field / robustness in the 
factory

Performance Metrics

Single Arrays

• Single arrays achieve improved run size economy (or 
provide advantages in resolving selected effects)
• Selection guided by “effect ordering principle”
•
“…those with a larger number of clear control-by-noise 
interactions, clear control main effects, clear noise main 
effects, and clear control-by-control interactions are 
judged to be good arrays.”
“Some of the single arrays … are uniformly better than 
corresponding cross arrays in terms of the number of 
clear main effects and two factor interactions”

Fitting the Model to Data
• Collect published full factorial data on various 
engineering systems 
– More than data 100 sets collected so far
• Use Lenth method to sort “active” and 
“inactive” effects
• Estimate the probabilities in the model
• Use other free parameters to make model pdf

Robust Design Method
Evaluation Approach
1. Instantiate models of multiple “engineering 
systems” 
2. For each system, simulate different robust 
design methods 
3. For each system/method pair, perform a 
confirmation experiment      
4. Analyze the data

ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference, September 28 - October 2, Salt 
Lake City, UT.

A Comparison of Taguchi's Product 
Array and the Combined Array in 
Robust Parameter Design
We have run an experiment where we have done 
both designs simultaneously (product and 
combined). In our experiment, we found that the 
product array performed better for the 
identification of effects on the variance. An 
explanation for this might be that the combined 
array relies too much on the factor sparsity
assumption.

and Technology will be held May 19-21, 2004.

Harrison’s “H1”
• Longitude Act of 1714 
promises £20,000 
• Accurate nautical 
timekeeping was one 
possible key
• But chronometers 
were not robust to the 
shipboard 
environment
• Harrison won through 
robust design!

Example -- A Pendulum Robust 
to Temperature Variations

• Period of the swing is affected by 
length 
• Length is affected by temperature
• Consistency is a key to accurate 
timekeeping
• Using materials with different thermal 
expansion coefficients, the length can 
be made insensitive to temp

Defining “Robustness Invention”

• A “robustness invention” is a technical 
or design innovation whose primary 
purpose is to make performance more 
consistent despite the influence of noise 
factors
• The patent summary and prior art 
sections usually provide clues  

Classifying Robustness Inventions
