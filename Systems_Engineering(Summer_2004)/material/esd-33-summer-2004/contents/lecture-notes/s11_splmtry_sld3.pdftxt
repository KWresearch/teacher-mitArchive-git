• Frey – A role for one factor at a time?
• Next steps

One way of thinking of the great advances 
of the science of experimentation in this century 
is as the final demise of the “one factor at a 
time” method, although it should be said that 
there are still organizations which have never 
heard of factorial experimentation and use up 
many man hours wandering a crooked path.
– N. Logothetis and H. P. Wynn

“The factorial design is ideally suited for 
experiments whose purpose is to map a 
function in a pre-assigned range.”
“…however, the factorial design has certain 
deficiencies …        It devotes observations to 
exploring regions that may be of no interest.”
“…These deficiencies of the factorial design 
suggest that an efficient design for the present 
purpose ought to be sequential; that is, ought 
to adjust the experimental program at each 
stage in light of the results of prior stages.”
Friedman, Milton, and L. J. Savage, 1947, “Planning Experiments Seeking Maxima”, in 
Techniques of Statistical Analysis, pp. 365-372.

“Some scientists do their experimental work in single 
steps.  They hope to learn something from each run … 
they see and react to data more rapidly …”

“…Such experiments are economical”

“…May give biased estimates”

“If he has in fact found out a good deal by his methods, 
it must be true that the effects are at least three or four 
times his average random error per trial.”

Cuthbert Daniel, 1973, “One-at-a-Time Plans”, Journal of the 
American Statistical Association, vol. 68, no. 342, pp. 353-360.

Conclusions
• Factorial design of experiments may not be 
best for all engineering scenarios
• Adaptive one-factor-at-a-time may provide 
more improvement
– When you must use very few experiments AND
– EITHER Interactions are >25% of factorial effects
OR
– Pure experimental error is 40% or less of factorial 
effects
• One-at-a-time designs exploit some 
interactions (on average) even though it can’t 
resolve them
• There may be human factors to consider too
