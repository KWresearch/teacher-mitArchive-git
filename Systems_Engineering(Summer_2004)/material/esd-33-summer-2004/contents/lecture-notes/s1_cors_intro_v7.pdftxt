SDM Core Courses 
A Simple View of their Relationship
• System Architecture (ESD.34) is about the 
ARTIFACTS themselves 
– Concept, form, function, decomposition …
• Systems Engineering (ESD.33) is about the 
PROCESSES that enable successful 
implementation of the architecture 
– QFD, Pugh Concept Selection, Robust Design,  …
• System Project Management (ESD.36) is about 
MANAGING TASKS to best utilize resources in 
the systems engineering process 
– CPM, DSM, System Dynamics …

superior understanding of the subject matter, a 
foundation of extensive knowledge, and a skillful use of 
concepts and/or materials.
• B  - Good performance, demonstrating capacity to use 
the appropriate concepts, a good understanding of the 
subject matter, and an ability to handle the problems and 
materials encountered in the subject.
• C  - Adequate performance, demonstrating an adequate
understanding of the subject matter, an ability to handle 
relatively simple problems, and adequate preparation for 
moving on to more advanced work in the field.

Time Commitment and 
Expectations
• ESD.33 is a 12 unit subject (3-0-9)
• The units correspond to the time that an 
adequately prepared student with good study 
habits is expected to spend in a normal week  
• However, the summer term is compressed from 
a regular academic year term as there are 10 
weeks as compared to 14 during a regular term.  
• Thus, the weekly time commitment is 16.8 hrs.  
• The out of class time will roughly be split 
between reading assignments and homework. 

Plan For the Session
• Introduce the Instructors
• Outline the Subject and Policies
• Discuss Assignment #1
• What is Systems Engineering?

Assignment #1

Bloom’s Taxonomy of 
Educational Objectives
5. Synthesis
design, invent, propose

4. Analysis
predict, model, derive

2. Comprehension

Bloom, B. S., Krathwohl, D. R. (1984) 
Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, 
New York: Addison Wesley.

Writing Good Learning Objective 
Statements
• Write objectives at topic or module level
• Identify what the students should be able to do 
(use verbs like calculate, explain, justify)
• Make objectives clear and specific
(avoid verbs like know, understand, learn)
• Balance objectives among Bloom’s levels
• Revise notes and tests on the basis of 
objectives
Gronlund, N.E., (1994) How to write and use instructional objectives.  New 
York: Macmillan

Teaching Smart People How to Learn

• “Single Loop Learning” = 
perfecting your conception
• “Double Loop Learning” = 
changing your conception
• Smart people are great at single 
loop learning
• But change in conceptions often 
comes through failure and smart 
people aren’t used to failure

Teaching Smart People How to Learn
Consequences
Action Strategies
Governing Variables

• Control the purpose of 
the meeting or encounter
• Maximize winning
• Suppress negative 
feelings
• Be rational

Governing Variables

• Valid (validatable) 
information
• Free and informed 
choices
• Internal commitment to 
choice

• Advocate your 
position in order to be 
in control
• Save face (yours and 
others)

• Miscommunication
• Self fulfilling 
prophesies
• Self-sealing
• Escalating error

Action Strategies
• Advocate your 
position and combine 
with inquiry and public 
testing
• Minimize face saving 
behaviors

Consequences

• Fuller communication
• Double loop learning
• Solving problems

The Reflective Practitioner

• Donald Schön studied the learning process of 
engineers, managers, architects, and 
psychotherapists 
• Competent practitioners usually know more than 
they can say (tacit knowledge)
• When someone reflects in action, he becomes a 
researcher in the practice context
• A practitioner’s reflection can serve as s 
corrective to over-learning 

Plan For the Session
• Introduce the Instructors
• Outline the Subject and Policies
• Discuss Assignment #1
• What is Systems Engineering?

Engineering

The process of devising a system, 
component, or process to meet desired 
needs.  It is a decision-making process 
(often iterative) in which the basic 
sciences, mathematics, and engineering 
sciences are applied to convert resources 
optimally to meet a stated objective  
– Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology

The Earliest Engineering?
Stone tools >>1,000,000 BC

Fire >500,000 BC

Spears circa 400,000 BC

Sewing circa 23,000 BC

Spear thrower 14,000 BC

Domestication of sheep 9,000 BC

Permanent settlement and irrigation 7,000 BC

Copper circa 6,000 BC

Division of labor 5,000 BC

International Council on Systems 
Engineering

Systems Engineering
Systems Engineering is an interdisciplinary 
approach and means to enable the 
realization of successful systems. It 
focuses on defining customer needs and 
required functionality early in the 
development cycle, documenting 
requirements, then proceeding with design 
synthesis and system validation while 
considering the complete problem:
•Training
•Operations 
•Manufacturing 
•Support 
•Performance 
•Cost 
•Disposal 
•Test
•Schedule 

INCOSE
International Council on Systems 
Engineering

Systems Engineering
• Systems Engineering integrates all the 
disciplines and specialty groups into a 
team effort forming a structured 
development process that proceeds from 
concept to production to operation. 

• Systems Engineering considers both the 
business and the technical needs of all 
customers with the goal of providing a 
quality product that meets the user 
needs. 

Discussion Point

• What distinguishes Systems Engineering
from Engineering?

The Great Pyramid

• >10,000 people 
coordinated
• ~30 years of effort
• Did the design and 
construction of the 
great pyramid entail 
systems engineering?

Discussion Point
• Did the design of the CFM56 jet engine entail a 
systems engineering function?
• Did the design of Whittle’s jet engine entail a 
systems engineering function?

The Machine Age
• Characterized by 
reductionism 
• Ancient roots
– Aristotle (Physics)
– Archimedes 
• Renaissance
•
Industrial revolution(s)
– F. W. Taylor
– “Scientific Management”
– Gabor, Andrea. “The 
Geniuses of Modern 
Business - Their Lives, 
Times, and Ideas.” In The 
Capitalist Philosophers.

Discussion Points

• What aspects of systems engineering 
were practiced pre-WWII?
• Which pre-WWII engineers exhibited 
systems engineering talents?

Transition to the Systems Age

• Beginning ~ 1940 (according to Blanchard & 
Fabrycky)
• Rescuing Prometheus
• Thomas P. Hughes, Prof. of History and 
Sociology of Technology, U. of Penn.
• Tells the story of four major projects
– SAGE
– Atlas
– CA/T
– ARPANET

Key Aspects of SAGE

• First project to use 
computers for info 
processing and process 
control
• Engineers play a key management role
• Military / Industrial / University Complex
– MIT Lincoln Labs
– MITRE Corporation
• Criticized for its technical inadequacies 

The Atlas Project

• Produced the first ICBM
• 18,000 scientists and 
engineers
• 17 contractors
• 200 subcontractors
• 200,000 suppliers
• Coordinated by the Ramo
Woodridge Corporation

Key Aspects of the Atlas Project

• Firmly established the “Systems Engineering” 
approach to management
• Identified key challenges early (re-entry)

Boston’s Central Artery Tunnel

• “The largest, most 
complex, and 
technically 
challenging highway 
project…”
– www.bigdig.com/
• >7 Miles of tunnels
• Projected to cost 
$14.6B
• 87% Complete

Key Aspects of the CA/T

• Greater “messy complexity” than either SAGE or Atlas 
(T. Hughes)
• Bechtel / Parsons Brinkerhoff coordinates
• ~1/3 of budget spent on remediation
• Highly publicized mistakes
– Voids in concrete of Zakim Bridge
– Planning maps missing the Fleet Center
– "Based on anecdotal evidence, I believe that there is a genuine 
potential for monetary recovery. " - MA State Inspector General
• How was the CA/T project similar to/different from from 
the building of the Great Pyramid?
Is the CA/T project successful so far?

•

ARPANET

• A prime example of scalable architecture
• New trends in management of big projects 
– Flatter    - Less centralized  - Meritocratic
• Do these trends work for other systems?  

Discussion Points
• Do the systems engineering practices of big 
programs like Atlas work for simpler systems?
• Is there a major difference between the 
engineering process of the “machine age” and 
the “systems age” even for the same basic 
function?

History of Systems Engineering
Summary
• Engineering has a long history
• Systems Engineering seems to be a more 
recent phenomenon
• Strongly related to management
• Post WWII government-funded projects 
played a major role in defining SE 
– NOTE:  Clausing, Axelband, Campbell article 
explores commercial SE and contrasts in with 
government SE
