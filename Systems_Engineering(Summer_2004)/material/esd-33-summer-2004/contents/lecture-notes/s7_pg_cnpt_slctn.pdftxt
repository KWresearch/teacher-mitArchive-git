Plan for the Session
• Notes on exam #1
• Summary of last session -- QFD
• Brainstorming (ideas from IDEO)
• Pugh Concept Selection
– What is it for?
– How do you use it?
– Critique
• Next steps

Preliminary Feedback on Exam #1

• Most people seem to be doing very well
• Some people seemed to run into a time 
crunch (my theory is that #1 + open book 
caused the time problem)
• I will do my best to account for the time 
issue in final grading, but I do suggest 
preparing differently for the next exam
• There were a few points I obviously should 
have emphasized more clearly 

Short Answers

• How is kaizen related to flow? (HP video)
• If a design has more DPs than FRs it is a 
______ design and the extra DP 
contributes needlessly to ________.
• A decoupled design must have its DPs set 
in a _______________.
• “Remove” rather than “scrape” ice.  Or 
better yet, maintain a clear view.

Push Systems –
Order arrives at the front of the system and is produced in the 
economical order quantity.
Q. How long did it take for the order to go through the system?

Time = 0

Time = 1

Time = 2

Time = 3

Time = 4

Pull Systems-
The order arrives at the end of the line and is “pulled” out of the system. 
WIP between the machines allows quick completion. 

Pros and Cons;
Pull can fill small orders quickly, but 
must keep inventory for all part 
types. Design can help here but not 
in all cases. 

No Silver Bullet

• People are selecting a variety of 
frameworks (both “useful” and “not so 
useful”)
• People are talking about what they know
• The results are very good

What is the QFD for?

QFD is for
• Coordinating skills within an 
organization 
– Serves as a lingua franca
– Helps break down the functional 
silos
– Encourages real teamwork
• Designing goods that customers 
want to purchase
– Creates external focus
– Provides immersion in the 
specifications
• Target setting for mature 
products

•

QFD is NOT for
• Automatic decision making
– “the house absolves no one of 
the responsibility of making 
tough decisions” 
Implementing a quick fix
– “None of this is simple…”
– “An elegant idea ultimately 
decays into process…”
– “What is also not simple is 
creating an organization capable 
of absorbing elegant ideas”
• More difficult to use for highly 
novel / unprecedented functions

Hauser and Clausing, 1988, “The House of Quality”, Harvard Business Review.

Quality Function Deployment
Summary
• “… can break down functional barriers and 
encourage teamwork …”
• “The house relives no one of the responsibility 
of making the tough decisions”
• Many of the most effective companies use QFD
• Surveys suggest that QFD provides long term 
competitive advantages
• The arguments against QFD so far seem weak

e.g., QFD

specification
e.g., brain-
storming

Controlled 
Convergence
• This is Pugh’s vision 
of the conceptual 
phase of design
• Takes us from a 
specification to a 
concept
• Convergent and 
divergent thinking 
equally important

Kelley, Tom. The Art of Innovation: Lessons
in Creativity from IDEO, America’s Leading
Design Firm. New York: Doubleday, 2001.

By the general manager of IDEO --

America’s top design firm.

This book describes the processes 

and practices that keep IDEO

creative and vibrant.

IDEO Brainstorming

• A group problem solving technique that 
involves spontaneous contribution of ideas 
from all members of the group

Composing the Brainstorming Group

• Get a range of expertise and perspectives
– Software / hardware
– Marketing, engineering, maintenance, sales
– Engineers, scientists, linguists, artists
• Include the client if possible
• Enough people to maintain momentum
• Small enough that all are engaged
– 5 to 7 people

Preparing for the Brainstorm

The House of Quality!!

• Understand the problem
• Gather background info
• Set up the room
– Everyone around one table
– Stacks of 8.5X11 plain paper
– Whiteboards or easels and markers
– Props (hardware, technologies)
– Food and drink

The Five Rules of the Brainstorm

• Defer judgment
What did Pugh say about this?
• Build upon the ideas of others
• One conversation at a time
• Stay focuses on the topic
• Encourage wild ideas

Recording Ideas

• Record EVERY idea
• Make a good picture of the idea
– This is helpful for the Pugh matrix later
• Headlining (choose a descriptive name)
• Shoot for a large number (100 in one hour)

Some Brainstorming Tricks to Try

• Analogy (nature, other technologies, …)
• Inversion

• Combination
• Checklists (TRIZ is essentially a well 
designed checklist, more in session #8)

Evaluation Matrix

The First Run
Generate multiple solutions to same problem spec.
Depict the solutions (sketches)
Form the matrix
Choose criteria (and clarify them)
Choose datum (pick one of the ‘best’ solutions)
Insert comparisons (+, S, -), form sums thereof
Look at strongest concepts, try to reverse 
negatives (combine with complementary concepts)
Look at weaker concepts, try to improve them
Eliminate the weakest remaining concepts

The Second Run
Strengthen the best concepts from first run
–
This is substantial engineering work
– More detailed descriptions will emerge
Note the plural – develop multiple concepts
–
Expand evaluation criteria
Choose new datum (pick one of the ‘best’ solutions)
Insert comparisons (+, S, -), form sums thereof
Seek agreement among team on the best concept
Further phases may be required to obtain convergence
“…experience has shown that, almost without exception, 
the results of Phases I and II will be confirmed…”

Some Challenges

• “people who have a lot of experience … 
exhibit an impatience ‘to get on with it’ and 
may consider that the procedure holds 
them back…”
• “strong willed individuals who have a lot of 
experience and whose initial concepts 
have not emerged in the final selection … 
commence a defense based on emotion, 
experience, and bluster…”

Role of the Facilitator

• Controls the flow / pace of the session
• Records the results (creates the matrix)
• Maintains a tight discipline on the participants
– Comparison to the datum concept
– Preventing tangents
– Encourages clarification of criteria
– Encourages clarification of concepts
• Seeks opportunities for divergence (hybrids)

What is the Pugh Matrix for?

The Pugh matrix is for
• Structuring and representing an 
evaluation procedure 
– Serves as common visual
– Provides a discipline
– Helps break down self-sealing 
behavior
– Encourages real teamwork
• Convergence
– Eliminates weaker ideas
– Retains a set of strong concepts
• Divergence
– Helps to identify opportunities 
for combination

The Pugh matrix is NOT for
• Automatic decision making
– “the scores or numbers … are for 
guidance only and must not be 
summed algebraically.”
– “it avoids the rigidity and false 
confidence of rating/weighting 
matrices”
• Completely controlling the 
process
– “… stimulates creative 
unconstrained thinking due to its 
lack of rigorous structure”
• Trade studies
– More on this today

Pugh, Stuart, 1991, Total Design, Addison-Wesley, New York.

Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem

• Given the choice between x, y and z, a group 
preference should satisfy conditions:
– If everyone in the group prefers x over y, the group preference 
should be for x over y
– If the group preference is for x over y and for y over z, then the 
group preference should be for x over z
– If the group must choose between x and y, their preference 
should not depend upon whether z exists or not
– There shouldn’t be a dictator in the group, i.e., the preferences 
of each individual in the group should count
• Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem: no method of 
preference aggregation meets these conditions

same set of words. You’ll see them again later when we focus on engineering.

Pugh selection is exactly opposite, it has rank ordered 
designs precisely wrong

e.g., QFD

specification
e.g., brain-
storming

Summary
• QFD helps with the front 
end
• Then a large number of 
concepts are needed
• Pugh controlled 
convergence helps with the 
convergent and divergent 
process
• Enhances creativity, 
communication, and builds 
consensus
• Don’t over emphasize 
numbers
• Do be aware of how 
product attributes combine
