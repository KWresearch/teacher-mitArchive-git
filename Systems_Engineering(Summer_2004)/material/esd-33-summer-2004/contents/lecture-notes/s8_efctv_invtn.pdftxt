Rapid growth
Maturity
Infancy
Typical steps of evolution of technological systems can be illustrated by an S-shaped curve that reflects changes of the system's benefit-to cost ratio with time since the inception 
of the system. In the infancy phase the system’s development is relatively slow. The next phase is characterized by fast development, usually attributed to commercialization of 
the system and perfecting of the manufacturing processes. Then the system’s evolution is eventually slowing down and stalls or even starts degrading.  These segments of the 
system life curve are typical for its old age. In some cases the system undergoes "renaissance", which can be sparked by availability of new materials, of new manufacturing 
technology, and/or by development of new applications. When the present system is approaching the end phase of its development, usually a new system having a higher 
performance potential is already waiting in the wings.  
On the other hand, some systems are deteriorating. An example is turntables for LP records, which are supplanted by CD systems, although some basic 
models of the turntables are still in production.
The length and slope of each segment on the life curve of the system depends, of course, not only on technical but also on economic and on human

psychological inertia factors.  While the common sense (in the hindsight!) suggests that a new system should start its fast development when development of the present system 
starts to slow down, frequently it is delayed by special interest groups, which have large investments, job security, etc., associated with the old system.

INVENTION

The above is the basic S curve. The abscissa is time, or the amount of resources that have been applied. The ordinate is performance divided by cost. If the cost is relatively 
fixed, then the performance alone can be used. If the performance is relatively fixed, then the reciprocal of cost can be used alone.

Levels of invention

• 1. A component intended for the task is used
• 2. Existing system is slightly modified
• 3. At least one system component is radically 
changed or eliminated; within one discipline
• 4. A new system is developed; interdisciplinary
• 5. Pioneering invention, often based on recently-
discovered phenomena

Laws of evolution

• Increasing ideality
• Non-uniform evolution of subsystems; e.g., bicycle
• Transition to a higher-level system
• Increasing flexibility of systems
• Transition from macro to micro level
• Shortening of energy flow path
• Harmonization
• Completeness
• Increasing controllability

Primary Law of Evolution
• The Law of Increasing Degree of Ideality is the 
central law of evolution of technology.
• Other Laws of Evolution are mechanisms for 
increasing the Degree of Ideality.

Law/Line of Evolution

Increasing Degree of Ideality
Functionality
Degree of Ideality =
ΣCosts+ Σ Problems
Costs = $, size, weight, part count, etc.
• In the course of evolution, degree of ideality
of technological systems increases.
– Systems  with  higher  degree  of  ideality  have 
much  better  chances  to  survive  the  long-run 
market  selection  process,  i.e.,  to  dominate  the 
market.
Analysis of the history of technology led Altshuller to the discovery and formulation of the primary law of evolution of technological systems — the Law of Increasing Degree of 
Ideality. 

Degree of Ideality is defined as a ratio of Index of Functionality to Index of Cost, where cost can be expressed in dollars, or units of size or weight, etc. It is, 
essentially, the Benefit-to-Cost ratio. A truly ideal system in most cases is a virtual reality, it exists only in our imagination. This means that in the process of evolution either the 
system performing certain functions becomes less complicated/costly, or it becomes capable of performing its functions better or performs more functions. A combination of 
these evolutionary processes also often occurs.

DESCRIPTION

The useful action of A on B is
accompanied by a harmful
action of A on B.

The effect of A on B is useful,
but the effect of B on A is
harmful.

A acts usefully on B, but det-
rimentally affects itself.

The useful action of A on one
part of B (B') is accompanied
by a harmful action on anoth-
er part of B (B").

The useful action of A on B is
accompanied by a harmful
action on the environment or
an adjacent system C.

Separation of physical conflicts

• Separation of opposite properties in time
• Separation of opposite properties in space
• Separation of opposite properties between 
the whole and its parts

These simple ideas lead to many inventions.

July 2004

MIT

17

Separation in space

• Basic approach: apply one requirement in 
one place, and the conflicting requirement 
in another place
• Make front of armor plate from hard steel, 
back of armor plate from tough steel, bond 
together into one plate
• Invention came from separating the two 
requirements; one to front, second to back

Role of science

• TRIZ laws suggest new “rooms” in which we 
might find a new invention
• Then use scientific data base to combine scientific 
effects with suggested pattern of invention
• Thousands of scientific effects; most people know 
less than 20
• Use extensive data base to find effects that can be 
used in conjunction with a TRIZ-identified pattern 
of invention

• Ensure that everything best done during the 
innovation cycle has been done
• After Readiness the remaining actions can 
be easily undertaken in the normal 
downstream commercialization process
• Commercialization people will clearly 
understand the requirements that flow 
downstream from Effective Innovation

• Provides:
– Early specification maturity
– Early technology readiness
– Early identification of special manufacturing 
requirements
• Critical parameter drawing is key

if it is accompanied by simultaneous
effective innovation of the total value chain

Collateral failure

• Cylinder-valve paving breaker, 1959
• Great technical success, loved by customers
• But it required innovation by Sales
• Didn’t happen; successful technical 
innovation blocked from market

37

Collateral success

• First Xerox copier
• Revolutionized copying in 1960
• But was very expensive
• Office managers would be reluctant to buy
• Leasing was innovative Sales approach; 
enabled huge commercial success of 
xerographic copiers

5 problems of EI management

• Innovation done ineffectively; EI process 
not followed
• EI not well integrated into PA
• EI not well integrated with other enterprise 
processes
• Spending on EI is at wrong level
• EI had wrong people
