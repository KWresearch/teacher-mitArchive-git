S - Curves

Atish Banergee –

We first studied S-curves in technology strategy…The 
question remained why the S-curve has the peculiar 
shape. Well I found the answer in system dynamics. It is a 
general phenomenon and not restricted to technology.

It can be thought of as two curves:
1. The lower part of the curve is growth with 
acceleration....
2. The upper part of the s-curve is called a goal-seeking 
curve and can be thought of as growth with deceleration…

Critical Parameter Management

• CPM provides discipline and structure
• Produce critical parameter documentation
– For example, a critical parameter drawing
• Traces critical parameters all the way through to 
manufacture and use
• Determines process capability (Cp or Cpk)
• Therefore, requires probabilistic thinking

Probability Definitions

• Sample space – a list of all possible 
outcomes of an experiment
– Finest grained
– Mutually exclusive 
– Collectively exhaustive
• Event - A collection of points in the sample 
space 

Concept Question

• You roll 2 dice

• Give an example of a single point in the sample 
space?

• How might you depict the full sample space?

• What is an example of an “event”?

Probability Measure

• Axioms
– For any event A,
– P(U)=1
– If A∩B=φ, then P(AUB)=P(A)+P(B)

≥AP
(
)

0

For the case of rolling two dice: 
A = rolling a 7 and 
B = rolling a 1 on at least one die
Is it the case that P(A+B)=P(A)+P(B)?

Discrete Random Variables

• A random variable that can assume any of 
a set of discrete values
• Probability mass function
– px(xo) = probability that the random variable x
will take the value xo
• Let’s build a pmf for rolling two dice
– random variable x is the total 

px(x)

x

x=10

Continuous Random Variables

continuous ranges

Error Budgets

• A tool for predicting and managing 
variability in an engineering system
• A model that propagates errors through a 
system
• Links aspects of the design and its 
environment to tolerance and capability
• Used for tolerance design, robust design, 
diagnosis…

Engineering Tolerances

• Tolerance --The total amount by which a 
specified dimension is permitted to vary
(ANSI Y14.5M)
• Every component
within spec adds

Multiple Tolerances

• Most products have many tolerances
• Tolerances are pass / fail
• All tolerances must be met (dominance)

Variation in Manufacture

• Many noise factors affect the system
• Some noise factors affect multiple 
dimensions (leads to correlation)

• Motorola’s “6 sigma” programs suggest 
that we should strive for a Cp of 2.0.  If this 
is achieved but the mean is off target so 
that k=0.5, estimate the process yield.
