3D Printing

1. The Printer spreads a layer of powder from the feed box 
to cover the surface of the build piston.
2. The Printer then prints binder solution onto the loose 
powder.
3. When the cross-section is complete, the build piston is 
lowered slightly, and a new layer of powder is spread 
over its surface. 
4. The process is repeated until the build is complete. 
5. The build piston is raised and the loose powder is 
vacuumed away, revealing the completed part.

3D Computer Modeling

• Easy visualization of 3D form
• Automatically calculate 
physical properties
• Detect interferences in assy
• Communication! 
• Sometimes used in milestones

Thomke’s Advice

• Organize for rapid experimentation
• Fail early and often, but avoid mistakes
• Anticipate and exploit early information
• Combine new and traditional technologies

Organize for Rapid 
Experimentation

• BMW case study
• What was the enabling technology?
• How did it affect the product?
• What had to change about the process?
• What is the relationship to DOE?

Fail Early and Often

• What are the practices at IDEO?
• What are the practices at 3M?
• What is the difference between a 
“failure” and a “mistake”?

Anticipate and Exploit Early 
Information
• Chrysler Case study
• What was the enabling technology?
• How did it affect the product or process?
• What is the relationship to DOE?

Enlightened Experimentation

• New technologies make experiments faster and 
cheaper
– Computer simulations
– Rapid prototyping
– Combinatorial chemistry

• Thomke’s theses 
– Experimentation accounts for a large portion of development 
cost and time
– Experimentation technologies have a strong effect on 
innovation as well as refinement 
– Enlightened firms think about their system for experimentation
– Enlightened firms don’t forget the human factor

Statistics and Probability

Probability theory is axiomatic.  Fully defined 
probability problems have unique and precise 
solutions…  
The field of statistics is different.  Statistics is 
concerned with the relation of such models to 
actual physical systems.  The methods 
employed by the statistician are arbitrary 
ways of being reasonable in the application of 
probability theory to physical situations.

History

Issues to grapple with today:
• What are some of the techniques at the intersection of 
SE with statistics?
• What can SE learn from the history of statistics?
• How can SE find its epistemic basis (partly) via 
statistics?

Analyzing Survey Results

• I asked how many hours per week you 
spend on ESD.33
• The responses
– times=[15, 12.5, 15, 20, 17.5, 12, 15, 12, 15, 14, 20, 
12, 16, 16, 17, 15, 20, 14, 17.5, 9, 10, 16, 12, 20, 17]
– µ=15.2, σ=3.1
• Is my plan to switch to 9 units (12 hrs/wk) on 
track? [h,p,ci,stats] = ttest(times,12,0.05,'right')
• Am I on track for 12 units (16 hrs/wk)? 
[h,p,ci,stats] = ttest(times,16,0.05,'both')

• This Matlab code generates data at 
random (no treatment effects)
• But assigns them to 5 different levels
• How often will ANOVA reject H0 (α=0.05)?
for i=1:1000
X=random('Normal',0,1,1,50);
group=ceil([1:50]/10);
[p,table,stats] = anova1(X, group,'off');

Correlation versus Causation

• Correlation – an observed 
association between two 
variables
• Lurking variable – a common 
cause of both effects
• Causation – a deliberate 
change in one factor will bring 
about the change in the other

Discussion Topic

• ~1950 a study at the London School of Hygiene 
states that smoking is an important cause of 
lung cancer because the chest X-rays of 
smokers exhibit signs of cancer at a higher 
frequency than those of non-smokers
• Sir R. A. Fisher wrote 
– “…an error has been made of an old kind, in arguing 
from correlation to causation” 
– “For my part, I think it is more likely that a common 
cause supplies the explanation”
– Argued against issuance of a public health warning

Design of Experiments
• Concerned with 
– Planning of experiments 
– Analysis of resulting data
– Model building
• A highly developed technical subject
• A subset of statistics?
• Or is it a multi-disciplinary topic 
involving cognitive science and 
management?

Basic Terms in DOE
• Response – the output of the system you are measuring 
(e.g. range of the airplane)
• Factor – an input variable that may affect the response 
(e.g. location of the paper clip)
• Level – a specific value a factor may take
• Trial – a single instance of the setting of factors and the 
measurement of the response
• Replication – repeated instances of the setting of 
factors and the measurement of the response
• Effect – what happens to the response when factor 
levels change
Interaction – joint effects of multiple factors

• They usually affect the

• The drop off is

Important Concepts in DOE
• Efficiency – ability of an experiment to estimate 
effects with small error variance
• Resolution – the ability of an experiment to 
provide estimates of effects that are clear of 
other effects
• Sparsity of Effects – factor effects are few
• Hierarchy – interactions are generally less 
significant than main effects
• Inheritance – if an interaction is significant, at 
least one of its “parents” is usually significant

Design of Experiments 
in the 20th Century

• 1926 – R. A. Fisher, factorial design
• 1947 – C. R. Rao, fractional factorial design
• 1951 – Box and Wilson, response surface 
methodology 
• 1959 – Kiefer and Wolfowitz, optimal design theory 

George Box on Sequential 
Experimentation
“Because results are usually known quickly, the natural 
way to experiment is to use information from each group of 
runs to plan the next …”

“…Statistical training unduly emphasizes mathematics at 
the expense of science.   This has resulted in undue 
emphasis on “one-shot” statistical procedures… examples 
are hypothesis testing and alphabetically optimal designs.”

Statistics as a Catalyst to Learning
Major Points for SE

• SE requires efficient experimentation
• SE should involve alternation between induction 
and deduction (which is done by humans)
• SE practitioners and researchers should be 
skeptical of mathematical or axiomatic bases for 
SE
• SE practitioners and researchers should maintain 
a grounding in reality, data, experiments

Plan for the Session

• Next steps

One way of thinking of the great advances 
of the science of experimentation in this century 
is as the final demise of the “one factor at a 
time” method, although it should be said that 
there are still organizations which have never 
heard of factorial experimentation and use up 
many man hours wandering a crooked path.
– N. Logothetis and H. P. Wynn

“The factorial design is ideally suited for 
experiments whose purpose is to map a 
function in a pre-assigned range.”
“…however, the factorial design has certain 
deficiencies …        It devotes observations to 
exploring regions that may be of no interest.”
“…These deficiencies of the factorial design 
suggest that an efficient design for the present 
purpose ought to be sequential; that is, ought 
to adjust the experimental program at each 
stage in light of the results of prior stages.”
Friedman, Milton, and L. J. Savage, 1947, “Planning Experiments Seeking Maxima”, in 
Techniques of Statistical Analysis, pp. 365-372.

“Some scientists do their experimental work in single 
steps.  They hope to learn something from each run … 
they see and react to data more rapidly …”

“…Such experiments are economical”

“…May give biased estimates”

“If he has in fact found out a good deal by his methods, 
it must be true that the effects are at least three or four 
times his average random error per trial.”

Cuthbert Daniel, 1973, “One-at-a-Time Plans”, Journal of the 
American Statistical Association, vol. 68, no. 342, pp. 353-360.

The approach always exploited the two largest effects
including an interaction although the experiment 
cannot resolve interactions

Factorial design correctly
estimates main effects BUT

AB interaction is larger 
than main effects of factor A or B
and is anti-synergistic 

Factorial design worked as advertised but missed the 
optimum

Conclusions
• Factorial design of experiments may not be 
best for all engineering scenarios
• Adaptive one-factor-at-a-time may provide 
more improvement
– When you must use very few experiments AND
– EITHER Interactions are >25% of factorial effects
OR
– Pure experimental error is 40% or less of factorial 
effects
• One-at-a-time designs exploit some 
interactions (on average) even though it can’t 
resolve them
• There may be human factors to consider too
