ESD.33 -- Systems Engineering

Session #6
Quality Function Deployment

Dan Frey

Follow-up on Session #4

Shashi Kant -- My belief is that XP is a 
very interesting concept and should be 
covered - at least superficially. It would 
help to have an idea of such a process 
even in a highly structured development 
processes like  in the defense or 
aerospace industries. So my vote would 
be to at least touch on the subject,  I think 
even non-software people would find it 
fascinating.

Follow-up on Session #4

Stephen Friedenthal -- Intuitively it seems rational that 
the best decision making process is coherently logical.
However, if I take it as an axiom that I can never have 
perfect information this leads to the implication that a 
perfectly rational and logical decision making process 
can lead to a faulty conclusion…
But, by the same logic this implies that if your logic is 
flawed you may or may not get the wrong answer …
So, does this imply that it can be advantageous not to be 
a rational decision maker … or, is there a flaw in this 
train of thought?

Plan for the Session
• What is rationality?
• Quality Function Deployment
–What is it for?  What is it not for?
–What is it?  How do you use it?
–Does it work?
• Next steps

What is Rationality?
• “Theoretical rationality applies to beliefs … e.g. 
beliefs that are self evident or derived from self 
evident beliefs by a reliable procedure…”
• “Another account of rational action is ... to act 
rationally is to act on universalizable principles, 
so that what is a reason for one person must be 
a reason for everyone…” 
• “Practical rationality applies to actions…acting 
rationally simply means acting in a way that is 
maximally efficient in achieving one’s goals”
- Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy

Human rational behavior is shaped by a 
scissors whose two blades are the structure of 
task environments and the computational 
capabilities of the actor.
- Herbert Simon

Simon, H. A., 1990, “Invariants of human behavior,” 
Annual Review of Psychology, 41, 1-19. 

"Bounded rationality is a genuinely 
interdisciplinary topic.  Its subject matter 
is the mechanisms that humans, 
institutions, and artificial agents use to 
achieve their goals.  The common 
denominator is that decisions need to 
be made with limited time, knowledge, 
and other resources, and in a world that 
is uncertain and changing."

Gigerenzer, G. and R. Selten, 2001, “Rethinking Rationality,” in 
Bounded Rationality, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA. 

“Heuristics that are matched to 
particular environments allow agents to 
be ecologically rational, making 
adaptive decisions that combine 
accuracy with speed and frugality.  We 
call the heuristics “fast and frugal” 
because they process information in a 
relatively simple way, and they search 
for little information.”

Todd, P. M., and G. Gigerenzer, 2003, “Bounding Rationality to 
the World,” Journal of Economic Psychology, v. 24, pp. 143-165. 

Concept Question

• Consumer reports suggests that a 
particular car model is the top rated car in 
its category in overall quality including 
frequency of repair.
• Your neighbor purchased the same car 
model six months ago and just 
experienced a major and costly 
breakdown.
• Should you still buy the car?

Concept Question

• Long experience suggests that a particular 
stretch of a river is among the safest for 
children to swim in.
• Yesterday your neighbor’s first born son 
was eaten by a crocodile in that stretch of 
river.
• Should you still let your child swim there?

The Less is More Effect

• Goldstein and Gigerenzer (1999)
• A pair of cities is drawn from a set of the 83 
largest German cities
• The task was to decide which of the two cities in 
each pair was larger
• American students – accuracy ~ 65%
• German students – accuracy was lower
• Why?  The recognition heuristic works best 
when information is at an appropriate level 
(sometimes less information is better)

One Reason Decision Making

• The “Take The Best” heuristic equals or 
outperforms any linear decision strategy when 
information is noncompensatory, that is, when 
the potential contribution of each new cue falls 
off rapidly so that combinations of later cues 
cannot outweigh earlier ones (Martignon & 
Hoffrage,1999).
• Such environments seem fairly commonplace, at 
least in an approximately noncompensatory
form.

Follow-up on Session #4
No, sometimes they are just heuristic
Stephen Friedenthal -- Intuitively it seems rational that 
the best decision making process is coherently logical.
However, if I take it as an axiom that I can never have 
perfect information this leads to the implication that a 
perfectly rational and logical decision making process 
can lead to a faulty conclusion…
Right!!
But, by the same logic this implies that if your logic is 
flawed you may or may not get the wrong answer …
So, does this imply that it can be advantageous not to be 
a rational decision maker … or, is there a flaw in this 
train of thought?
Yes, there is growing, empirical evidence 
that it is advantageous to be irrational in a 
strictly formal sense and instead to be 
ecologically rational

Implications for “Tools” Phase

• We chose simple methods that have 
evidence of effectiveness in field use
• We do not assume that the latest method 
with added “improvements” is better
• In particular, if a new fangled method 
requires more information or processing it 
is under suspicion
• Of course, if field data prove it out, we will 
add it to the course

Plan for the Session

• Quality Function Deployment
–What is it for?  What is it not for?
–What is it?  How do you use it?
–Does it work?

International Council on Systems Engineering

Systems Engineering
Systems Engineering is an interdisciplinary 
approach and means to enable the 
realization of successful systems. It 
focuses on defining customer needs and 
required functionality early in the 
development cycle, documenting 
requirements, then proceeding with design 
synthesis and system validation while 
considering the complete problem:
•Training
•Operations 
•Manufacturing 
•Support 
•Performance 
•Cost 
•Disposal 
•Test
•Schedule 

Discussion of Marketing

• What training, exposure have you had to 
“inbound” marketing techniques?
• What are the key techniques you that can 
be used to:
– Determine Customer Attributes?
– Prioritize Customer Attributes?

Traditional "Over the Wall" 
Design

What is the QFD for?

QFD is for
• Coordinating skills within an 
organization 
– Serves as a lingua franca
– Helps break down the functional 
silos
– Encourages real teamwork
• Designing goods that customers 
want to purchase
– Creates external focus
– Provides immersion in the 
specifications
• Target setting for mature 
products

•

QFD is NOT for
• Automatic decision making
– “the house absolves no one of 
the responsibility of making 
tough decisions” 
Implementing a quick fix
– “None of this is simple…”
– “An elegant idea ultimately 
decays into process…”
– “What is also not simple is 
creating an organization capable 
of absorbing elegant ideas”
• More difficult to use for highly 
novel / unprecedented functions

Hauser and Clausing, 1988, “The House of Quality”, Harvard Business Review.

Customer Attributes (CAs) 
• CAs = phrases “customers” use to 
describe the desired product
– Who are the “customers”?
• Try to preserve the “voice of the customer” 
by using their language

Engineering Characteristics (ECs)
• ECs should describe the product in measurable
terms 
• ECs should directly affect CAs
• ECs should be applicable to other designs (the 
competitor’s design & new alternatives)

• Are there other attributes of good ECs?
• What are some examples of 
poorly written ECs?

Experiences with QFD in the U. S.

• 35 projects at 9 U.S. firms (1987-1989)
• 29 had data on product quality / cost
• 7 out of 29 credit QFD with short-term material 
benefits (quality, time, or cost)
• Virtually all reported strategic benefits
– Structuring decision-making across functional areas
– Building an organized, motivated team
– Moving information efficiently from its origin to the 
ultimate user

Hazelrigg, G. A., 1997, “On Irrationality in Engineering Design”, ASME J of Mech Des.

Hazelrigg’s Claims 

• Arrow’s theorem implies that 
– “irrationality is practically assured”
– “a customer-centered view of design is not 
possible”
• The majority of methods in common use in 
engineering design provide results that are 
“egregiously in error”
• Adopting DBD approach leads to a factor 
of two improvement in the bottom line

A Case Study to Test QFD 

• “The major problem with HoQ is the way in 
which the attribute relations are 
established with arbitrary scales”
• “…it has been suggested that the use of 
such scales is no better than using a 
random number generator.  Evidence of 
this is offered in the case study…”

Olenwik, A. T. and K. E. Lewis, 2003 “On Validating Design Decision Methodologies”, 
ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference, DETC2003 DTM-48669.

A Case Study to Test QFD 

• The total combination of number scales (from 1 to 9) were found.  Examples 
include (1,3,9), (2,4,6),(1,2,3) etc. and are always in the form a>b>c.

• Next, random numbers taken from a uniform distribution from 1 to 9 were 
inserted where ever a relationship was found to exist.

•  The relative weights were calculated for the 84 cases.

“t-tests show that the null 
hypothesis is not false for all 
the engineering attributes 
except balance and volume”

“Certainly, the results 
generated here should raise 
some concerns about the use 
of HoQ as a design tool.”

Quality Function Deployment
Summary
• “… can break down functional barriers and 
encourage teamwork …”
• “The house relives no one of the responsibility 
of making the tough decisions”
• Many of the most effective companies use QFD
• Surveys suggest that QFD provides long term 
competitive advantages
• The arguments against QFD so far seem weak

Plan for the Session
