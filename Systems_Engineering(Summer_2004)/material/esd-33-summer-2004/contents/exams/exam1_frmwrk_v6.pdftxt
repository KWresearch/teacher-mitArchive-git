ESD.33 Systems Engineering  
 
Exam 1 – Frameworks 
 
Due  Date:  Nominally,  22  June,  8:30AM-  10:30AM  EST.    However,  for  students 
unable  to  take  the  exam  during  class  time,  the  exam  may  be  taken  in  any  two 
hour interval in the subsequent week. 
 
Deliverable: 
Individual  written  assignment 
communication is always valued). 
 
Time  allotment:  You  must  do  the  exam  in  a  single  2  hour  block  of  time.    You 
must  submit  the  completed  exam  on  line  before  7:30AM  Tues  29  June.    Having 
tested  this  exam,  I  found  it  takes  30  minutes  just  to  read  and  comprehend  the 
questions (my test subject was not a native speaker of English but was proficient 
in  English).    There  is  enough  time,  but  you  will  have  to  manager  your  time 
effectively. 
 
Grading:    This  assignment  represents  10%  of  your  final  course  grade.    The 
exam has 100  total points.   Question 1  is 45 points, question 2  is 30 points, and 
question 3 is 25 points. 
 
Objectives: 
This  assignment  is  intended  to  assess  and  reinforce  your  understanding  of  the 
frameworks for systems engineering.  
 
Exam Questions: 
 
1.  (45  points)  This  question  is  comprised  of  a  series  of  15  short  answer 
questions  based  on  the  assigned  readings.    Each  response  should  be  about 
three  sentences  (you  can  also  use  simple  graphics).    Sub-questions  (a  through 
o) are worth 3 points each:  
a)  (3  points)  Argyris  introduces  the  idea  of  a  “theory-in-use”.   What  does  he 
mean by a “theory-in-use”?  How does it differ from an “espoused theory”? 

 
 
b)  (3  points)  Shön  discussed  the  concept  of  “over-learning”.    Briefly  provide 
an  example  of  Shön’s  “over-learning”  that  might  occur  in  an  engineering 
organization. 

 
c)  (3 points) According to the INCOSE systems engineering handbook, about 
how  much  of  a  program’s  budget  should  be  spent  on  the  Systems 
Engineering  function?    According  to  the  INCOSE,  what  are  some  of  the 
consequences of underinvestment in Systems Engineering?

d)  (3  points)  Given  the  definitions  of  Systems  Engineering  and  System 
Architecture  in  the  INCOSE  systems  engineering  handbook,  is  Systems 
Engineering  a  subset  of  System  Architecting,  or  vice  versa?    Briefly 
explain. 

 
 
e)  (3  points)  Provide  an  example  of  an  “Acquisition  and  Supply  relationship” 
as defined in the INCOSE systems engineering handbook. 

 
 
f)  (3  points)  A  monopoly  describes  a  market  condition  in  which  there  is  a 
single  seller.    What  is  the  term  for  a  market  condition  in  which  there  is  a 
single buyer? 

 
g)  (3 points) What does the term “kaizen” denote?  How is it related to “flow”? 
 
 
h)  (3  points)  What  are  the  three  major  activities  in  the  Lifecycle  Value 
Creation  Framework  as  defined  by Stanke  and Murman?   Which  of  these 
three  activities 
is  most  emphasized 
in  Womak’s  Lean  Thinking 
framework? 

 

 

 
 

 
 
  
i) 

 
 
j) 

 
 
l) 

(3 points) Name three practices at Toyota (as documented by Ward et. al.) 
which  would  tend  to  give  Toyota  a  low  rating  on  the  capability  maturity  
model matrices in the appendices of Stanke and Murman’s paper. 

(3  points) What  does  Suh  call  a  design  with  more  DPs  than  FRs?   What 
are the implications of this kind of design in light of Suh’s axioms? 
 
 
    
k)  (3 points) Assume a projector’s  function  is to create an  image which  is the 
right  size  (fits  the  screen)  and  is  properly  focused.    The  projector  has  a 
lever  which  changes  the  image  size  and  which  also  causes  the  focus  to 
change.   The projector also has a knob  that changes  the  focus but  leaves 
the  image  size  essentially  unchanged.    According  to  axiomatic  design,  is 
this system uncoupled, coupled, or decoupled? 

(3  points)  For  the  projector  described  in  (k),  what  does  axiomatic  design 
say  about  the  system  and  its  operation?    According  to  Axiomatic  Design, 
is  it  acceptable?    Does  Axiomatic  Design  provide  any  insights  about  how 
to operate such a system?

m)  (3  points) Restate  the  following  Functional Requirement    into more  nearly 
solution  neutral  terms:    “Scrape  ice  from  the  surface  of  the  car’s 
windshield”   

 
 
n)  (3 points) Euclidean geometry  is based upon a set of axioms  including “all 
right angles are equal to one another.”  Is this axiom more aligned with the 
use  of  the  term  “axiom”  by  Suh  or  the  use  of  the  term  “axiom”  by 
Hazelrigg?  Explain briefly. 

 
o)  (3  points)  The  course  calendar  lists  many  tools  we  plan  to  learn.    Name 
the  most  important  SE  tool  that  we  are  not  currently  planning  to  cover.  
Justify your choice briefly. 

 

 

2.  (30 points) Your goal on  this question  is  to evaluate a system as described  in

Burger Czar (a fast food restaurant), operates in two different ways depending on 
time of day.  Let’s call these modes “NORMAL” and “BUSY”.   

 

3 of 6

 

 

 

NORMAL mode is used from 2PM to 4PM.  During NORMAL mode, a hamburger 
is  made  the  following  way.    When  a  customer  places  an  order,  it  cues  an 
employee  (the  broiler  attendant)  to  take  a meat  patty  and  a  bun  from  the  feezer 
and  place  them  in  broiler  that  automatically  cooks  them  and  ejects  them  (this 
takes  about  2 minutes).   A  different  employee  (the  condiment  jockey)  is  cued  by 
the patty being ejected to catch the cooked patty and toasted bun.  Based on the 
customer’s  specifications,  the  condiment  jockey  places  condiments  on  the 
hamburger,  wraps  it  in  paper,  and  gives  it  to  the  cashier  (this  takes  about  0.5 
minutes).    The  cashier  then  puts  the  hamburger  in  a  bag  with  other  items  and 
delivers  it  to  the  customer  (this  takes  about  0.5  minutes).    The  whole  process 
takes  about  three  minutes  from  order  placement  to  delivery  and  completely  by-
passes  the  steamer  and  heat  lamps.    No  new  order  is  taken  until  the  customer 
has  their  food.    There  is  only  one  employee  at  each  station  (one  cashier,  one 
condiment jockey, and one broiler attendant).   

BUSY  mode  is  in  place  from  4PM  to  6PM.    Five  regular  sized  hamburgers  are 
made  in  the  standard  condiment  configuration  and  placed  under  heat  lamps.    In 
addition,  five  hamburgers  are  held  in  a  steamer  between  the  broiler  and  the 
condiment  table  (these  are  cooked  but  have  no  condiments  on  them).    The 
condiment jockey seeks to maintain the stock of items under the heat lamp at the 
prescribed  level.    The  broiler  jockey  seeks  to  maintain  the  stock  of  items  in  the 
steamer  at  prescribed  level.    No  new  order  is  taken  until  the  customer  has  their 
food.    There  is  only  one  person  at  each  station  (one  cashier,  one  condiment 
jockey, one broiler attendant).    

During BUSY mode, there is a quality control function in place.  Any item under a 
heat  lamp  or  in  a  steamer  for  more  than  10  minutes  is  generally  too  stale  or 
soggy  to sell  to  the customer.   Therefore,  items placed under  the heat  lamp or  in 
the steamer are “time stamped”.  The person who draws a hamburger from under 
a heat  lamp or steamer does  so under a  “first  in  first out”  rule drawing  the oldest 
one available.  If that item is over 10 minutes old, it is discarded. 

a)  (5 points) State whether NORMAL mode is a push or pull mode. Also state 
whether BUSY mode is a push or pull mode. Explain your reasoning 
briefly. 

 
 
 
b)  (5 points) At 3 PM, seven people arrive simultaneously each wanting one 
hamburger.  Estimate how long before the 7th person has a hamburger.  
Explain your reasoning and assumptions briefly. 

 
 
 
c)  (5 points) At 4:05 PM, seven people arrive simultaneously each wanting 
one hamburger.  Estimate how long before the 7th person has a 
hamburger.  Explain your reasoning and assumptions briefly.

d)  (5 points) On an unusual day, there are no customers at all from 4PM to 
5PM.  Identify “muda” in the system under these conditions.  Explain your 
reasoning briefly. 

 
 
 
e)  (5 points) Evaluate the overall system (which includes two different modes 
of operation) from the perspective of the “Lean Thinking” framework.  As a 
minimum, state whether you think that having two modes of operation is a 
good idea (you may have to state some assumptions about the system 
and the demands on the system not given explicitly in the problem 
statement). 

 
 
 
f)  (5  points)  Suggest  changes  to  the  system  that  might  be  made  if  you 
discover  that  customers  are  very  picky  about  quality  (e.g.,  sogginess  & 
staleness) and are willing to wait up to five minutes for their food.

3.  (25  points)  Fred  Brook’s  paper  No  Silver  Bullet  discusses  several  software 
engineering  processes  /  tools.    Brooks  evaluates  each  according  to  how  it 
addresses  the  “accidents”  or  the  “essence”  of  the  software  engineering 
challenge.    Brooks  then  attempts  to  quantify  how  much  improvement  one  might 
expect if a particular process / tool is developed and implemented. 

a) (15 points) Select a  framework you  think  is useful  for your  field of professional 
work.    Discuss  how  that  framework  addresses  the  “essence”  or  the  “accidents” 
that make good systems engineering difficult. 

 

 

 

b) (10 points) Select a framework which you do think is not useful for your field of 
professional work.   Discuss how  that  framework addresses  (or  fails  to address?) 
the “essence” or the “accidents” that make good systems engineering difficult.
