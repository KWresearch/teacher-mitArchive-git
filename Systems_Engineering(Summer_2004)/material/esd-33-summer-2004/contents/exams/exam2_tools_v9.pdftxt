the customer. Develop a plan for deploying these tools in a specific engineering 
organization.  As a minimum, do the following:  

a.  Describe your plan including the timing of the use of these tools, and 
how/why that timing is important. 

b.  Describe how this plan promotes quality and reliability.

1.  In  the  relationships  matrix  of  the  House  of  Quality,  if  there  is  a  row  with  no 
marks in the matrix, this is an indication that ________________________. 

 
2.  In the relationships matrix of the House of Quality, if there is a column with no

Cleaning”  also  tend  to  make  the  food  processor  louder  in  operation,  what 
should the engineer record in the House of Quality (and where)?
