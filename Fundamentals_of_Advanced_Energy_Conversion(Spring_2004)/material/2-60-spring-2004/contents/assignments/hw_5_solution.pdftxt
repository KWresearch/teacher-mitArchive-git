4. Increasing the pressure raises the mole fraction of CH3OH when T ≤ 340, but does not 
have a significant effect after T ≥ 360. It is due to the following reasons: 
1)  In the first reaction, which generates CH3OH, the forward reaction favors higher 
pressure since the number of moles decreases during the forward reaction. Thus, by 
increasing the pressure of the reactor, the concentration of CH3OH increases more 
rapidly.  
2)  After T ≥ 360, even at low pressure, the first reaction is sufficiently fast. So 
increasing the pressure does not help. Also, note that the concentration of CH3OH 
drops back to almost zero with time due to the third reaction (dissociation of 
CH3OH) indicating that the third reaction becomes active after T  ≥ 360.  

 
5. The maximum mole fraction of CH3OH one can obtain is  ~33% at T=340K and P=10-
100atm with a residence time less than 1msec.  
 
6.  The mole concentration changes at T=340K, P=10atm and residence time=1msec are 
as follow:
