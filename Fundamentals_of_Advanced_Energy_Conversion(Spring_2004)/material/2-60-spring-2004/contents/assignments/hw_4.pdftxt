1.  For an overall reaction of 

H2O <=> H+ + OH- 
(a)  Use  the  Table  4.1  in  the  Lecture  Note  â€“  Electrochemical  Energy  Conversion  and 
Storage  to  define  two  half  cell  reactions  for  the  above  reaction  and  calculate  the 
electrochemical potential of the reaction under standard conditions. 
(b)  Calculate  the  molalities  of  H+  and  OH-  in  deionized  water  at  298K  from  the  Gibbs 
free energy of reaction. Show calculation step by step. 

 
2.  An  exhaust  gas  analyzer  uses  an  electrochemical  solid  state  cell  (sensor)  to  measure 
oxygen  concentrations  in  the  exhaust.  This  cell  consists  of  a  solid-state  electrolyte 
zirconium  dioxide  (ZrO2)  with  yttria  (Y2O3)  that  provides  oxygen  ion  conduction  in  the 
cell, and Pt electrodes used for anode and cathode, depicted as,

The  electrode  reaction  that  occurs  at  high  temperature  at  both  the  anode-electrolyte  and 
cathode-electrolyte interfaces is 

O2 + 4e <=> 2O2- 
(a)  Please  derive  the  governing  equation  for  the  cell  potential  as  a  function  of  pressures, 
Peg and Pair. 
(b) What would the cell voltage be when the partial pressure of oxygen in the exhaust gas 
is 0.02atm? 

 
3.  Consider  an  electrochemical  cell  with  different  concentration  of  aqueous  CuCl2 
solutions in each 1/2 cell.  3.5 molal CuCl2 on one side and 1 molal CuCl2 solution on the 
other  side  separated  by  an  ion  conducting  membrane  permeable  only  to  Cu+2  and  Cl-1 
ions.  The electrodes are Pt coated with a thin film of copper metal.  
 
(a) Initially will the cell produce a current against a resistive load?  Explain. 
(b) What is the maximum amount of work that such a cell would produce? 
(c) What happens to the concentrations of ions in the cell after a period of time? 
(d)  Is  there  a way  that you could modify  this cell  to determine  the mean  ionic activity of 
CuCl2 as  a  function of concentration?    (hint- Consider coupling  the cell  to a  standard 
hydrogen electrode via a salt bridge. 

 
The  molality  is  the  number  of  moles  of  solute  present  in  1000  grams  of  water  while 
molarity  is  the  number  of moles  of  solute  present  in  one  liter  of  water. Mole  fraction, 
molality
 . State all assumptions made in answering questions 1-3.
