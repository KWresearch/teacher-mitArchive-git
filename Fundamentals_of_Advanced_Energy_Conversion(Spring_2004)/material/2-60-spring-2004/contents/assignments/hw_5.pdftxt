Problem #1 
In this problem, you will practice working with finite rate reaction equations in the 
context of synthetic fuel production.  Review the ozone chemistry example in the note 
before working on this example.  You will discover how operating conditions must be 
selected carefully to maximize the yield of the desired chemical while minimizing others.  

A catalytic reactor is used for the synthesis of methanol,  CH 3OH , starting with water and 
carbon monoxide that are produced from coal gasification.  The catalyst in the reactor is 
active at temperatures between 300 and 450 K.  The reactor runs at isothermal conditions.  
The important “elementary” reactions for the conversion of carbon monoxide and water 
to methanol are: 

(1)  CO + 2H 2  ⇔ CH 3OH 
(2)  CO + H 2O ⇔ CO 2  + H 2 
(3)  CH 3OH → H 2  + CH 2O 

While these are, in principle, not elementary reactions, for the purpose of this analysis 
they can be considered as if they were.  These reactions take place in the gas phase, and 
under isothermal conditions.  The first two reactions are reversible, the third in an 
irreversible dissociation of methanol that, if possible, should be avoided. 

The feed gas into the reactor consists of 7/15 hydrogen, 1/5 carbon monoxide, 1/5 carbon 
dioxide and 2/15 steam, all by volume.  The total molar flow rate is 300 mol/s, the inlet 
temperature of the feed gas ranges from 300 - 400 K, and the reactor pressure ranges 
from 1 –160 atm. 

The objective of the following analysis is to find the conditions at which we can 
maximize the production of methanol within the reactor, including the pressure, 
temperature and residence time.  The residence time is defined as the time the gas spends 
within the reactor to reach the final state.  The following data are provided for the 
reactions:

The activation energies in these expression are given in cal, and the universal gas 
constant is R=1.987cal/mol K. Assume that the inlet gas and the reactor temperatures are 
the same.

Write down the reaction rate equations for the three reactions. 
Write down the formation rates for each species in terms of the time rate of 
change of its molar concentration. 
Integrate these equations for p = 1, 10 and 100 atm, at temperatures in the 
given range, take T = 320, 340, 360 and 380 K. 
Use these results to determine the impact of the pressure on the concentration 
of methanol in the products.  Can you explain this trend form the reaction 
equations? 
Use the results to determine the optimum operating conditions for maximizing 
methanol production in terms of p, T and residence time. 
How much heat transfer is required in your optimum case to keep the  

temperature constant within the reactor?


Integrating the differential equations is most easily done using Matlab ordinary 
differential equations solver, Sungbae will post an example on how to do that. 

Problem #2 

Consider the electrode reaction O + e = R. Under the conditions that bulk concentrations 
[O]*=[R]*=1mM, ko= 10-6cm/s, and α =0.3. 

1.	 Calculate the exchange current density, jo=io/A in microamps/cm2. 
2.  	 Draw a current density – overpotential curve for this reaction for currents up to 
600 microamps/cm2  anodic and cathodic. Neglect mass transfer effects. 
3.  Draw log  j  vs.  η a  curves for the current ranges in question 2.
