Consider a single proton exchange membrane fuel cell operated at 80C with pure H2 
and  pure  O2  inputs  at  150kpa,  in  which  Pt  nanoparticles  supported  on  carbon  are 
used as the electrocatalyst  for hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction. The anode 
and  cathode  electrode  areas  are  5cm2.  The  ohmic  resistance  across  the  fuel  cell  is 
5
ohms.  The  exchange  current  densities  for  the  rate  determining  steps  of 
310 −
⋅
oxygen  reduction and hydrogen oxidation on Pt nanoparticles are 5x10-11A/cm2 and 
1x10-3A/cm2, respectively.

1)  Calculate the equilibrium fuel cell voltage under the operating conditions. 
2)  Develop an analytical expression  that  relates  the  fuel cell operating voltage  to  the 
current density obtainable from the fuel cells by considering ohmic and activation 
overpotentials  across 
the  cell.  Plot 
the  effect  of  ohmic  and  activation 
overpotentials  to  the  fuel  cell  voltage  loss  as  a  function  of  current  density  in 
mA/cm2 in the range from 0 to 2A/cm2. 
3)  Plot the second law efficiency of the fuel cell (see equation 2.7 in lecture note on 
electrochemical thermodynamics (electrochemLecturenote1.pdf)) and the power 
density in W/cm2 as a function of current density in mA/cm2. 

 
 
Please state all assumptions clearly.
