Homework II Solution 

(1)  The efficiency in the ideal case (Carnot cycle) is: 

η ideal  =1-(300K)/(273K+1300K)=0.81.   

  Then, the second law efficiency becomes  

5.0 
=  62.0 
η II =
81.0 

LHV of C6H6=40141kJ/kg=3131MJ/kmol (liquid) (Boiling point of C6H6 is 80 C° ) 

Fuel per available energy is: 1kg/(40140kJ*0.81)=1kmol/2536MJ1 

Fuel per work produced without sequestration: 1kg/20070kJ=1kmol/1565MJ.

Since 6kmol(264kg) of CO2 is generated by 1kmol of C6H6, the required work for 
liquefaction is 60.7MJ/kmol of C6H6 (3.9% of the work produced in the cycle) 

Total sequestration work is 119.3MJ/kmol of C6H6 (7.6% of the work produced in 
the cycle)

Hence, 25% increase of the sequestration work (149.1MJ/kmol of C6H6 and 9.5% of 
the work produced in the cycle.) 

(5) Since no entropy should be generated in the process to minimize the required 
work, the temperature of the device should be regulated to be the same as that of 
environment (Isothermal compression). Note that work is supplied for separation and 
hence should be removed in the form of heat to the environment to keep the 
temperature constant. To reject heat while maintaining the temperature requires this 
process to occur very slowly. 

(6) Instead of using isothermal compression, one can consider isentropic compression 
and heat rejection in a real situation.  As we learned from problem II in Homework I, 
one can reduce the required work using intercooling. If one uses a large number of 
intercoolings and compressors, one can bring these compression and heat rejection 
processes closer to the ideal isothermal process. However, this will increase the 
capital cost of the plant. Using 3 compressors as shown below, the required work is 
72.6MJ/kmol of C6H6 (20% increase over the isothermal work)  

State 1 
T1=300K, P1=1atm, h1=810kJ/kg 

State 2 (Isentropic compression 1) 
P2=6atm, S2=S1, h2=920kJ/kg 

State 3 (heat rejection) 
T3=300K, P3=6atm, h3=805kJ/kg 

State 4 (Isentropic compression 2)
 P4=30atm, S4=S3, h4=910kJ/kg 

State 5 (heat rejection) 
T5=300K, P5=30atm, h5=780kJ/kg 

State 6 (Isentropic compression 3) 
P6=100atm,S6=S5, h6=840kJ/kg 

State 7 (heat rejection) 
 T7=300K, P7=100atm, h7=560kJ/kg

From  H R (T  = 832K ) = H p (T  = 1573K ) , we get  X  =

P=1atm 

110.56*3.76N2

T=300K, 
P=1atm 

Required work for separation: 674.8MJ/kmol of C6H6 (Significant increase in work 
due to the increase in the number of moles being separated) 

However, if we do not throw out  O 2  after the turbine and circulate it, we only use 
7.5moles of  O 2  instead of 110.56moles per 1 mole of C6H6. Hence, the required 
work is 
674.8MJ/kmol*7.5moles/110.56moles=45.8MJ/kmol of C6H6 

One problem of circulating  O2   is that we need to separate  O2   from CO2 in the 
product as follow: 

6CO2+103.06O2 

T=300K, 
P=1atm 

6CO2 

103.06O2  

T=300K, 
P=1atm 

The required work of this process is 58.0MJ/kmol of C6H6. 


Total required work for separation is 45.8+58=103.8MJ/kmol of C6H6. 


There is no change in the liquefaction work of CO2.

For the liquefaction work, if we assume inlet temperature is 300K, then we get the same 
required work (60.7MJ/kmol of C6H6). However, note that we may be able to use 
extracted heat from CO2  since the temperature of the CO2 after the separator is 2342K. 
The availability of CO2 can be calculated in the following process, assuming environment 
temperature is 300K
