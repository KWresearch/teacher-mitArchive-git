Homework I Solution 

 
 
Problem 1 
1.1 
 
Natural Uranium : X (g/yr) 
Enriched Uranium :Y (g/yr) 
Discarded Uranium: Z (g/yr) 
 
Mass Conservation: X=Y+Z                     Eq.(1) 
Mass Conservation of U-235: 
0.71X=4.4Y+0.25Z                                   Eq.(2) 
 
 
 
Using Eqs. (1) and (2), we get 
Y=0.1108X                                                 Eq.(3) 
 
Hence, we lose almost 90% of the natural uranium in the enrichment process. 
 
 
Since U-235 in the enriched Uranium is 4.4/100*Y, we can represent the used Uranium 
for fission from the natural Uranium as  
 
4.4/100*0.111X=0.004877X.                     Eq.(4) 
 
Hence, only 0.4877% of the natural Uranium is actually used for fission. 
 
Then, power can be represented as 
 
0.004877X* rankineη * nuclearη *1MW-day/g=1000MW*365 day* capacityη  
capacityη =0.9. Then, we get X=2.026*108 
where 
rankineη =0.35, 
nuclearη =0.95 and 
g/yr=202.6 ton/yr=0.56ton/day. 
 
1.2  
 
Average daily amount of coal used: X (kg/day) 
 
X* steamη *27800BTU/kg*1J/9.48*10-4BTU*1day/(24*3600sec) =1000*106 W* capacityη  
steamη =0.471. Then, we get X=6.04*106kg/day=5640 ton/day. 
where

Area for the flat panel : X (cm2) 
 
500cal/(cm2 day)/(0.239cal/J)* convη *X*1day/(24*3600sec)=1000*106W 
convη =0.12. Then, X=3.441*1011cm2. Also, total area required is 2X=68.8km2. 
where 
 
Problem 2

P1=1atm, T1=300K  → Isentropic compression I → P2,T2 
P2,T2→ Intercooling → P2’=P2,T2’=T1=300 
P2’,T2’ → Isentropic compression II → P3=100atm,T3

From Eq. (5), we get T2=T3=579K. Using Eq. (6) and cp~1kJ/kg K at T~450K, we get 
558kJ/kg. 
 
2.3 
 
P1=1atm, T1=300K  → Isentropic compression → P2=100atm,T2 
 
Using Eq. (5) again, we get T2=1118K. Using 
T~700K, we get  =w 900kJ/kg.

It is clear that intercooling reduces the work required for compression significantly. 
 
 
2.4 
w=vdP=0.001m3/kg*(10130kPa-101.3kPa)=10kJ/kg. 
 
The compression work of liquids is typically 1-2% of that of gases. 
 
2.5 Assuming 
cη ~0.7-0.9, work in 2.2 and 2.3 should increase by 10-40%.

ICEη =0.344  
 
Without considering the refinery efficiency of fuels, it becomes 
 
ICEη =0.330
