(a)  Use  the  Table  4.1  in  the  Lecture  Note  –  Electrochemical  Energy  Conversion  and 
Storage  to  define  two  half  cell  reactions  for  the  above  reaction  and  calculate  the

(b)  Calculate  the molalities of H+  and OH-  in deionized water at 298K. Show calculation 
step by step and state all assumptions made.

From  Eqs.  1  and  2,  one  can  get  Kw=[H+][OH-]=1.0x10-14  at  298K.  If  pH=7,  then 
[H+]=[OH-]=1.0x10-7. Then,  the molalities (mH+ and mOH-) and molarities ([H+] and  [OH-
]) of H+ and OH- are identical, which is equal to 1.0x10-7mole per 1000g water. 
 
The molality is the number of moles of solute present in 1000 grams of water while molarity is the 
number of moles of solute present in one liter of water. Note that 1000 grams is equivalent to one 
liter of water. 
 
 
 
2.  An  exhaust  gas  analyzer  uses  an  electrochemical  solid  state  cell  (sensor)  to  measure 
oxygen  concentrations  in  the  exhaust.  This  cell  consists  of  a  solid-state  electrolyte 
zirconium  dioxide  (ZrO2)  with  yttria  (Y2O3)  that  provides  oxygen  ion  conduction  in  the 
cell, and Pt electrodes used for anode and cathode, depicted as,

If  one  assumes  that  Peg  >Pair  and  Peg  and  Pair  are  the  partial  pressure  of  O2  in  the

3.  Consider  an  electrochemical  cell  with  different  concentration  of  aqueous  CuCl2 
solutions in each 1/2 cell.  3.5 molal CuCl2 on one side and 1 molal CuCl2 solution on the 
other side separated by a ion conducting membrane permeable only to Cu+2 and Cl-1 ions.  
The electrodes are Pt coated with a thin film of copper metal. 
 

(a)  Initially will the cell produce a current against a resistive load?  Explain. 
 
A concentration cell produces a voltage as it attempts to reach equilibrium, which will 
occur when the concentration in both cells are equal. To reach this point, Cu2+ ions in 
the  concentrated  solution  (3.5molal  solution)  are  reduced  while  oxidation  increases 
Cu2+ in the dilute solution. However, oxidation of Cl-1 cannot occur since the standard 
potential  of Cl-  is  higher  than  that  of Cu2+. Hence,  released  electrons  from  the  anode 
by  Cu2+  oxidation  can  produce  current  passing  through  a  resistive  circuit.  To  satisfy 
the  local electroneutrality, Cl-  should migrate  from  the  concentration  cell  through  the 
membrane to the dilute cell. These reactions are represented as follow:

(b) What is the maximum amount of work that such a cell would produce? 
 
Note  that  concentration  of  Cu2+  changes  from  3.5  to  (3.5+1)/2=2.25  in  the 
concentration cell and from 1 to 2.25 in the dilute cell.  
 
If we define X is the change in the molal values in the concentrated solution and 
assume that the activity coefficient of Cu2+ is 1 or does not change within the range 
between 1 to 3.5 molal, we get

Assuming T=300K, we get Work=1.47kJ/(mole of CuCl2) 
 
(c)  What happens to the concentrations of ions in the cell after a period of time? 
 
Over  a  long period of  time  the potential will drop  to zero when  the  concentrations of 
Cu2+ become 1.25 molal  in both cells. Also, Cl-1  ions will move  to  the dilute solution 
to satisfy local electroneutrality (1.25 molal in both cells). 
 
(d)  Is  there a way  that you  could modify  this  cell  to determine  the mean  ionic activity 
of  CuCl2  as  a  function  of  concentration?    (hint-  Consider  coupling  the  cell  to  a 
standard  hydrogen  electrode  via  a  salt  bridge.  State  all  assumptions  made  in
