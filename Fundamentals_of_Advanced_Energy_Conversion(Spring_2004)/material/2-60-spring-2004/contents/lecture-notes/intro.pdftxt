CO2 emission  

reduction:


• Improve plant 
efficiency 
• Use low C fuels

• Use pure H2 
• Sequester CO2!

• RENEWABLES

How to Fuel the Fuel Cell Engine?

Especially for mobile applications, fuel cells may work with a reformer 
(although direct methanol cells are also under development) …… 

HYDROGEN & THE HYDROGEN ECONOMY


•  Energy carrier: must be produced, stored, transported & charged.


• 
• 

Like electricity: expensive to produce, transport, not easy to store. 
Provides a good link with renewables or “non-exhaustables.” 

•	 Can be produced by: 
Oxygen or steam Reforming of hydrocarbon, or, 
Splitting water electrolytically or thermo-chemically. 

• 
Compression/liquefaction (20 K, 1 bar/293 K, 800 bar) energies are high. 
•  Has low volumetric energy density (even in liquid form) 

•  Storage: metal fiber tanks, cryogenic container, or in metal 

hydrides (solids): through physical or chemical sorption.


The Mobile

Storage Problem:

Fuel Cell may be the 

easiest piece of the 

puzzle!

Fundamentals of thermodynamics, chemistry,  transport processes  in energy sy stems. 
Ana lysis of energy conv ersion in thermo-mechan ical, thermo-chemical, electrochemical, 
and  photoelectric processes in existing and future powe r and  transpo rtation systems, with 
emphasis on e fficiency,  env ironmental impac t and p erformance . Systems utilizing fossil 
fuels, hyd rogen , nuc lear and  renew able resources, ove r a range  of sizes and scales are 
discussed. App lications  include  fuel reforming, hyd rogen  and  syn thetic fuel produ ction, 
fuel cells and batteries, combu stion, catalysis, sup ercritical and combined cycles, 
photovoltaics, etc. Energy  storage  and transmission. Optimal source utilization and  fuel-
life cycle ana lysis. 

From  matter  and  Energy  (1912)  by  Frederick  Soddy  (cid:173)
Noble Prize in Chemistry, 1921. 

“The laws expressing the relations between energy and 
matter are not solely of importance in pure science. 
They necessarily come first….. In the whole record of 
human experience, and they control, in the last resort, 
the rise or fall of political systems, the freedom or 
bondage of nations, the movements of commerce and 
industry, the origin of wealth and poverty and the 
physical  welfare  of  the  race.  If  this  has  been 
imperfectly recognized in the past, there is no excuse, 
now that these physical laws have become incorporated 
into everyday habits of thought, for neglecting to 
consider them first in questions relating to the future”
