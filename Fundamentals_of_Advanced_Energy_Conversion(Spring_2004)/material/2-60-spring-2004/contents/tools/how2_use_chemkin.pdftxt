How to use CHEMKIN 

1.  To open a Chemkin Window 

1)	  logon Athena 

2)  At the Athena prompt, type  

athena % add chemkin 

athena % chemkin  


3) 	 The following Chemkin window will pop up. 

Figure 1 Chemkin window 

4)	 Select an application from Chemkin window. The available applications and 
their functions are described below: 

•  Aurara: well stirred reactor simulation. 
•  Creslaf: channel flow simulation. 
•  Equil: equilibrium state calculation. 
•  Oppdif: diffusion flame between two opposing nozzles. 
•  Plug: Plug-flow chemical reactor simulation. 
•  Premix: steady, laminar, one-dimensional premixed flame 
simulation. 
•  Senkin: predicts homogeneous gas-phase chemical kinetics in a 
closed system with sensitivity analysis. 
•  Shock: predicts the state of the products behind incident and 
reflected shocks. 
•  Spin: simulates one-dimensional rotating-disk. 
•  Surftherm: analyzes the thermochemical and kinetic data in gasphase 
and surface chemical reaction mechanisms. 

In the next section, we describe how to use Equil. Other applications can be used in a 
similar manner. However, there is one distinct difference between Equil and other 
applications. Equil application doesn’t use reaction mechanism data, however others use it. 

2. How to Use Equil 

Equil computes the chemical equilibrium state of an ideal gas or solution mixture. 

1) Click the Equil button in the Chemkin window. 

2) The window in Figure 2 appears. 

Figure 2 Equil window 

3) To calculate equilibrium state, one needs to generate two input files: 
chem.inp and gas_equil.inp. 

4) If you click the edit button in Gas Chemistry, you can view and edit 
chem.inp file as shown in Figure 3. This chem.inp file contains elements 
and species data. 

Figure 3 Chem.inp file 

5) You can generate your own file and name it ****.inp instead of chem.inp 
file, but the file should be in the directory specified in the working directory. To 
generate the ***.inp file, either use the text editor in 
Athena or use a PC and send the file to Athena through FTP. 

6) Next, you need to generate Gas_equil.inp. When you click the edit button 
in Equil, you will see Figure 4. 

Figure 4 Gas_equil.inp 

(cid:122)REAC in Figure 4 stands for reactant; each line contains a reactant  

identified by its chemical symbol and its number of moles in the mixture.  

The reactants in the Figure 4 example are H2  , O2  and N2  . Their number of 

moles is: 2, 1 and 3.76,respectively.

(cid:122)HP means constant enthalpy and pressure conditions. Other options are

available, e.g., EV, etc.

(cid:122)TEMP specifies the starting temperature (Units-K) 

(cid:122)TEST specifies an estimate of the equilibrium temperature (Units-K)  

(cid:122)PRES specifies the starting pressure (Units-atm)  

(cid:122)CNTN is used to continue the computation in a different initial condition 

after END keyword. Therefore, if CNTN is used, one can get more than one

solution. In Figure 4, the initial temperature (keyword TEMP) is changed 

from 300 to 400.  

(cid:122)END signifies the end of the keywords for a particular equil calculation.


7) Also, you can generate your own file and name it ****.inp instead of 
Gas_equil.inp file. 

8) Once chem..inp and Gas_equil.inp files are ready, you can calculate the 
equilibrium conditions. Click the run button and the program will start computing 
the equilibrium conditions. 

9) After the computation is finished, click view the button of equil.out. You will see 
the following text.
