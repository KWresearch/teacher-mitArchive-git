Problem  F1  (15  pts).  (Reaction-diﬀusion  systems) For  the  reaction-diﬀusion 
system 

ut  = uxx  + 3u  + 13v ,  0 < x < π 
vt  = 9vxx  −  u  −  3v , 

with  no-ﬂux  boundary  conditions,  show  that:


a)  if  the  diﬀusion  terms  are  absent,  the  equilibrium  solution  is  stable;


b)  with  diﬀusion,  the  uniform  equilibrium  solution  is  unstable  to  linear

perturbations.  Which  modes  are  unstable? 

Problem  F2  (15  pts).  (Traﬃc  ﬂow) In  the  traﬃc  ﬂow  model,  ρt  + (ρu)x  = 0,

Problem  F3  (15  pts).  (Hyperbolic  system) Solve  the  initial  value  problem  for  the 
system
