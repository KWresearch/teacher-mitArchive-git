Please  make  this  your  title  page  and  write  your  name  in  the  box  above.  Excluding  exceptional 
circumstances,  late  homework  will  not  be  accepted.  Make  an  extra  eﬀort  to  explain  your  solutions 
with  maximum  clarity.  Points  will  be  deducted  for  unclear/incomplete  explanations.  Each 
problem  is  worth  10  points. 

Problem  Set  #1  (due  in  class  Thursday  Feb.  12). 

1.1.  In the point  explosion problem  considered in  class, determine how the  shock  speed  and 
shock  pressure  decay  with  time  and  with  distance  from  the  center. 

1.2.  On  dimensional  grounds,  the  solution  of  the  initial-boundary-value  problem  for  the 
heat  equation 

ut  = κuxx , 
u  (x, 0) = 0, u (0, t) = u0 . 

should  be  of  the  form:  u  =  u0f  (x2/κt).  Determine  this  function  f .  Choose  k  = 1  and 
u0  = 1  and  then  make  a  sketch  of  u  (x, t)  as  a  function  of  x  at  several  diﬀerent  times. 

1.3.  It  seems  reasonable  to  assume  that  the  power  P  required  to  keep  a  ship  of  length  l 
moving  at  a  constant  speed  V ,  depends  not  only  on  l  and  V ,  but  also  on  the  water  density 
ρ,  gravitational  acceleration  g ,  the  kinematic  viscosity  of  water  ν .  Determine  the  form  of 
that  dependence  using  dimensional  arguments. 

1.4.  Across a cell  membrane of  thickness  w  the mass concentration of  a biochemical  molecule 
is  Ci  on  the  inside  of  the  cell  and  C0  on  the  outside.  Let  d  be  the  diﬀusion  constant  of  the 
membrane (in  units  of length2/time).  Using  dimensional  analysis,  ﬁnd  the  relationship  for 
the  ﬂux  φ  of  the  molecules,  i.e.  the  mass  of  molecules  crossing  a  unit  area  of  the  membrane 
per  unit  time,  as  a  function  of  the  other  quantities. 

1.5.  A  ball  of  mass  m  is  tossed  upward  with  initial  velocity  V .  Assuming  the  force  caused 
by  air resistance is proportional  to the square of  the velocity  of  the ball  and  the gravitational 
ﬁeld  is  constant,  formulate  an  initial  value  problem  for  the  height  of  the  ball  at  any  time  t. 
Choose  characteristic  length  and  time  scales  and  recast  the  problem  in  dimensionless  form. 

1.6.  A  hydraulic  jump  is  a  popular  phenomenon  not  only  in  your  kitchen  sink,  but  also 
around MIT Math department.  Consider this experiment:  a thin jet of  water strikes ver­
tically  a  large  horizontal  plate  so  that  the  water  spreads  over  the  plate  in  radial  direction. 
It  is  observed,  as  you  can  conﬁrm  experimentally  in  your  kitchen,  that  the  depth  of  ﬂuid 
undergoes  a  sudden jump  at  some distance  R  from the point  of jet impact.  As it turns  out, 
under  a  wide  range  of  ﬂow  rates  Q (volume  of water per  unit time), the jump  location  R  de­
pends  on  Q,  the  ﬂuid  viscosity  ν  (length2/time),  and gravitational acceleration  g  as follows: 
R  =  cQ5/8ν −3/8 g−1/8 ,  where  c  is  some  number.  Can  you  get  this  scaling  from  dimensional 
analysis?
