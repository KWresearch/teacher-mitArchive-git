Name: 

Please  make  this  your  title  page  and  write  your  name  in  the  box  above.  Excluding  exceptional 
circumstances,  late  homework  will  not  be  accepted.  Make  an  extra  eﬀort  to  explain  your  solutions  with 
maximum  clarity.  Points  will  be  deducted  for  unclear/incomplete  explanations.  In  2.4-2.6  the problems 
are taken from the textbook. 

Problem  Set  #3  (due  in  class  Thursday  March  12). 

u  (x, 0) = 

and  the  boundary  conditions  u  (±π , 0) =  0.  Plot  your  solution 

2.1.  (15pts) By  separation  of  variables,  solve  the  following  problems: 
(a)  The  heat  equation,  ut  =  uxx ,  on  −π <  x < π ,  t >  0  with  the  initial  condition 
 
�
|x| ≤ 1 
1, 
1 <  |x| < π 
0, 
at  t  = {0,  1,  2,  10}. 
(b)  The  wave  equation,  utt  =  uxx ,  on  −π <  x < π ,  t >  0  with  the  initial  conditions 
 
�
|x| ≤ 1 
1 − |x| , 
1 <  |x| < π 
0, 
Plot  your  solution  at  t  = {0,  1/2,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5}. 

u (x, 0) = 

,  ut  (x, 0) = 0,  and  the  boundary  conditions  u (±π , 0) = 0. 

2.2.  (10pts) Use  the  Fourier  transform  to  solve  the  initial-value  problem  for  the  advection-
diﬀusion  equation,  ut  + 2ux  =  uxx ,  on  −∞  < x <  ∞  with  the  initial  condition  given  by 
u (x, 0) = exp (−x2 ).  Plot  the  solution  at  t  = {0,  1,  2,  10}. 

2.3.  (10pts) Solve the wave equation, utt  = uxx , on  −∞  < x <  ∞  with  the initial  conditions 
given  by  u (x, 0)  =  max (1 − |x| ,  0)  and  ut  (x, 0)  =  0.  Again,  plot  the  solution  at  t  = 
{0,  1/2,  1,  2,  3}. 

2.4.  (10pts) Problem 1.4.6. 

2.5.  (20pts) (a) Problem 1.4.1; (b)  Problem 2.1.1; (c)  Problem 2.1.2.  In (c)  also  sketch the 
characteristics  as  well  as  the  solution  at  several  diﬀerent  times. 

2.6.  (15pts) (a) Problem 2.2.1; (b)  Problem 2.3.2.
