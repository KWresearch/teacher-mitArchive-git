Please  make  this  your  title  page  and  write  your  name  in  the  box  above.  Excluding  exceptional 
circumstances,  late  homework  will  not  be  accepted.  Make  an  extra  eﬀort  to  explain  your  solutions  with 
maximum  clarity.  Points  will  be  deducted  for  unclear/incomplete  explanations.  AMSYL  stands  for  any 
mathematical  software you like,  such  as Matlab, Mathematica, Maple,  etc. 

Problem  Set  #2  (due  in  class  Thursday  Feb.  26). 

2.1.  (15pts) Find two-term asymptotic expansions of  all  ﬁve roots of  the following innocent ­
looking quintic: 

−  2x 2  + ǫ  = 0. 
x 5 
a) First, try  the naïve expansion  x  = x0 + ǫx1 + ǫ2x2 + ....  to quickly face a diﬃculty  of ﬁnding 
x0 ,  x1 ,  ...  To  get  out  of  the  trouble,  rescale  x  by  ﬁguring  out  possible  dominant  balances  in 
the  equation  and  then  continue  ﬁnding  the  expansions  in  the  new  rescaled  variables. 

b)  For both  ǫ  = 0.1  and  ǫ  = 1,  ﬁnd  the  numerical  values  of  the  roots  from  your  solution  in 
part  a)  and  compare  them  against  those  found  by  a  root  solver  in  AMSYL.  What  is  the 
accuracy  of your approximate solution (i.e.  calculate the relative error, assuming  the roots 
found  by  AMSYL  are  “exact”)? 

2.2.  (15pts) Consider  the  boundary  value  problem: 
 
� πx  �
′′ y  = 3y cos 
, y (0) = 0, y (1) = 1. 
2 
a)  Compute  the  numerical  solution  of  this  problem  using  AMSYL  and  plot  it. 
b)  Now  solve 
 
, y (0) = 0, y (1) = 1 

� πx  �
′′ y  = ǫy cos 
2 
by  a  perturbation  method  assuming  ǫ  →  0  to  at  least  two  terms,  i.e.  y  =  y0  (x) + ǫy1  (x) + 
O (ǫ2 ).  Take  ǫ  = 3  in  this  solution  and  compare  it  to  the  numerical  solution  found  in  part 
a),  i.e.  plot  the  two  solutions  together  on  a  single  graph.  Comment  on  the  accuracy  of  the 
asymptotic  solution. 
2.3.  (10pts) Use  singular  perturbation  methods  to  obtain  a  uniform  approximate  solution 
to the following problem: 

ǫy  ′′  + 2y  ′  + y  = 0, y (0) = 0, y (1) = 1. 

2.4.  (10pts)  Obtain  a  uniform  approximation  to  the  solution  of  the  BVP: 
ǫy  ′′ 
−  (2x  + 1) y  ′  + 2y  = 0, y (0) = 1, y (1) = 0. 

2.5.  (10pts) Consider  the  initial  value  problem, 
x¨ + ǫx˙ 3  + x  = 0, x  (0) = 0, x˙ (0) = 1. 

Assuming  the  multiple-scale  expansion  x  =  x0  (t, τ ) + ǫx1  (t, τ ) + ....,  where  τ  =  ǫt,  obtain 
the  leading-order  solution  x  = x0  (t, τ ) + O (ǫ).  Give  physical  interpretation  of  the  problem 
and  its  solution.
