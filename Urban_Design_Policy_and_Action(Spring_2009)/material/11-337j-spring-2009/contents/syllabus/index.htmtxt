11.301J Introduction to Urban Design and Development
***** Overview *****
How does urban design get done, and what is the role of democratically-elected
local government in this process? While there has been a lot of attention paid
recently to American and European urban designers crafting spectacular projects
in the autocratic regions of the world (e.g. China, Dubai, Abu Dhabi), we will
focus on the majority of the democratic world's struggles with the public
policy and implementation of urban design at the local level. The seminar is
designed to be a collective and interactive inquiry into critical questions:
    * How does government influence urban design, and why?
    * How should governments shape cities in a representative democracy and be
      a steward of the public interest?
    * What have been the outcomes of urban design policy in the past, and how
      do they interact with the interests of private developers and community
      groups?
    * Where does the power of shaping cities actually reside?
    * What is the range of the local government tools for urban design and what
      are their consequences?
    * What is the effectiveness of policy tools for designing specific
      districts of a city, such as theater districts or residential
      neighborhoods?
    * How have policy tools been deployed by local government to design the
      transformation a city?
    * What is at the cutting edge of urban design, public policy, and
      implementation? What are the strengths and weaknesses of this cutting
      edge work?
    * What are some future possibilities for public policy and urban design?
In order to address these questions, the seminar is structured around a series
of thematic investigations around specific readings, as described in the
following section.
