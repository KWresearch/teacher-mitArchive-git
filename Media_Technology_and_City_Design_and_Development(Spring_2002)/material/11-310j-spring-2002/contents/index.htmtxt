This class is one of the earliest studios at MIT to carry on the work of the
West Philadelphia Landscape Project started at the University of
Pennsylvania.Â It contains a full description of the project in the syllabus,
and examples of the student work in the projects section.
***** Course Description *****
This workshop explores the potential of media technology and the Internet to
enhance communication and transform city design and community development in
inner-city neighborhoods. The class introduces a variety of methods for
describing or representing a place and its residents, for simulating actions
and changes, for presenting visions of the future, and for engaging multiple
actors in the process of envisioning change and guiding action. Students will
engage two neighborhoods: the Mill Creek neighborhood of West Philadelphia, PA,
and the Brightwood/Northend neighborhood of Springfield, MA.Â Students will
meet real people working on real projects, put theory into practice, and
reflect on insights gained in the process. Our hope is that student work will
contribute to new initiatives in both communities.
The class Web site can be found here:Â Media_Technology_and_City_Design_and
Development.Â It is sponsored by theÂ West_Philadelphia_Landscape_ProjectÂ and
the Center for Reflective Community Practice.
