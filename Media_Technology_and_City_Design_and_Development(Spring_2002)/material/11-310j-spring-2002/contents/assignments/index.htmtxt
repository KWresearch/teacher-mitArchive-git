Each student will come up with two proposals for Web sites, each designed to
serve as a resource for the transfer of knowledge and future planning in the
Mill Creek and Brightwood/Northend neighborhoods, respectively. In the last
month of the semester, each student will collaborate on the implementation of
one of these proposals.
For further background on the project, see the WPLP Web site. The WPLP Web site
has received millions of hits since it first went online in Spring of 1996.
***** Course Requirements *****
Work for the semester will be evaluated in five ways:
                   Grdaing criteria.
ACTIVITIES                                   PERCENTAGES
Participation in Class                       15%
AÂ Journal, to be turned in weekly via emai15%
AÂ Proposal for Mill Creek                 15%
AÂ Proposal for Springfield                15%
AÂ Final Project                           40%
There will be no final exam. Ongoing work and final project will be posted
online. A knowledge of web-authoring and geographic information systems (GIS)
is not a prerequisite, but is highly desirable. For those who have no
background in web-authoring, there are online classes available through MIT.
