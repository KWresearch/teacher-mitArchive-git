The West 
Philadelphia 
Landscape Project is 
an action research 
program integrating 
research, teaching,

service. It is based in 
the Department of 
Landscape 
Architecture and 
Regional Planning at 
the University of 
Pennsylvania. Since 
the program began in

Website Proposal

Audience: The audience for this proposed website is the interested members of the Mill Creek community, which includes 
not only residents, but also those people connected to the area relationally, professionally, and commercially. Yet 
the site should be accessible and understandable for other people outside the community who want to know 
about Mill Creek and the West Philadelphia Landscape Project. The active site of the Mill Creek neighborhood 
will be of interest to the secondary audience (other organized community groups like NEON, professionals and 
academics like ourselves). The West Philadelphia Landscape Project component of the website, however, will be 
directed more specifically for this secondary audience.

Ownership/
Maintenance:

The subject of ownership, maintenance, and possibly hosting of this website ought to be discussed with the Mill 
Creek community members. Based on conversations and feelings gathered from the visit to West Philadelphia in 
February, I would suggest a partnership between the Mill Creek Coalition and students at Sulzberger Middle 
School in owning and maintaining the Mill Creek site, as well as the WPLP component. As current members of 
the Mill Creek community, these groups would best serve as the administrators to an active website about the 
Mill Creek neighborhood, and they seem to be the ones most enthusiastic about having ownership of such a 
website. Specific content should be decided by the Mill Creek Coalition and the students at Sulzberger. The hope 
is that the content would reflect not only these institutions but also those of other community interests. 
Investigating these other interests may rest upon the coalition and students who take up the administration of the 
website.

Purpose: The website will be a space where the Mill Creek community members can represent their neighborhood to 
themselves and to other communities. A part of the website will serve as an updated "newsletter" of sorts to the 
different organizations featured in the West Philadelphia Landscape Project based in Mill Creek (i.e. Mill Creek 
Coalition, Sulzberger Middle School, community gardens in West Philly, etc.). These will serve as homepages 
for the various groups, which they can update frequently as different news and activities arise for their group. 
These will all be linked from the main Mill Creek homepage. (See structure section). In the long run, I think it 
would be neat to have an emailable newsletter drawing interested members of the community to the website for 
more information. (Similar to the emailed headlines feature of the New York Times for example). These can be 
sent out every month or every two weeks on a regular basis to bring people interested in the Mill Creek 
neighborhood and its activities to the website for updated news.
The stories section can host a variety of stories from individual Mill Creek community members. A link will be 
directed to the stories of the WPLP which will be placed in the WPLP section. The general stories section of the 
Mill Creek site, however, will be a place for any story relevant to the neighborhood. The stories of the Mill Creek 
site can be anything from the community, not necessarily related to the watershed or the public activism. I think 
this would be a neat place for other voices in the neighborhood to emerge. Other issues pertinent to the 
community may be raised in this manner, and perhaps will lead to dialog. 
The WPLP part of the website will serve more as an archival section, which can be updated as needed. Based on 
Jeff Scaveron's suggestion, an important part of this section will be stories from people and/or about places in 
Mill Creek and "events" of the WPLP. Whether the subject is about a person/role, an object, place, or event, the 
story should be a personal account. First-person points of view are so much more compelling. Also, other parts 
of the WPLP section will have descriptive documents and histories so the "third-person" story of the WPLP is 
being presented in a way. This other material should be well-structured and organized for easy browsing, 
searching, and clarity. Perhaps multiple "browse by" or "search by" options would be helpful, i.e. browse/search 
by chronology, medium, specific project, issue, agency, etc.
