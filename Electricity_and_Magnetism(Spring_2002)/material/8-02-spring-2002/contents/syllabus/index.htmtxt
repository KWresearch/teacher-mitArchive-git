***** Textbook *****
Giancoli, D. C. Physics for Scientists &amp; Engineers. Vol. 2. Prentice Hall.
------. The Study Guide and Student Solutions Manual. 3rd ed. Prentice Hall.
***** Lectures - Homework - Solutions - Exams - Quizzes - Grades *****
There will be 36 lectures, 10 problem sets, 3 exams during regular lecture
hours, and a 3-hour final. Weekly 15-minute quizzes will be given in
recitations. During exams, I expect you to know all material covered in (i) the
lectures, (ii) the reading assignments, (iii) the problem sets and (iv)
recitations. When the need arises, Lecture Supplements (see Lecture Notes) will
be made available.
Please hand in your homework on the due dates before 4 PM. Three problems,
randomly chosen, will be graded. Solutions will be made available on the day
after the due dates.
The homework counts for 10%, the weekly quizzes for 15%, each exam for 15%, and
the final exam counts for 30% of your course grade.
There will be no make-up exams!
A missed homework, quiz or exam counts as a zero. Only in case of verifiable
illness can you be excused from taking one of the 3 exams. If at all possible,
this should be done before the exam.
***** Recitations *****
There are 28 recitation sections. If for any reason you want to change section,
please see the Course Manager; she will accommodate you as much as possible.
